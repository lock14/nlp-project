Harold Crick � IRS auditor, milquetoast, and poster child for obsessive-compulsive disorder �  wakes up one morning to the rather unsettling realization that he has the voice of an Englishwoman narrating his life. The voice describes the state of Harold�s lonely existence; it lists his neuroses and personality quirks; it even counts the number of strokes of his toothbrush (a number that never changes). At first, Harold seems less concerned than might be expected; he merely trudges through his daily routine like the voice is just the latest in a series of slights and injustices life has heaped upon him (for a truly lonely soul, maybe even a disembodied voice beats no voices at all; surely someone more well-adjusted would go mad inside 15 minutes). But when the narrator announces that his death is imminent, Harold decides he has to find out who this author is and stop her before she has him thrown off a bridge or into a turbine. It turns out the voice belongs to Kay Eiffel (Thompson), a talented but troubled novelist who�s famous for her dedication to killing off protagonists. In fact, the only reason Harold is still alive is that Eiffel is suffering from an epic case of writer�s block and can�t figure out the best way to off him. A good movie but not a great one, Stranger Than Fiction
 is reminiscent of the films of Charlie Kaufman (Adaptation
, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)
 but lacks that writer�s conceptual rigor and imaginative power. Too often the movie gets lost in the thicket of its own ideas and fails to tackle some of the juiciest questions those ideas raise: How come Eiffel doesn�t narrate those parts of Harold�s story that involve his looking for her? Did he exist before the book? And how could he exist after it? Kaufman would have had a field day answering these questions. Fiction
 screenwriter Zach Helm, though, seems unable to fully get his head around them. As Harold, Ferrell is deadpan almost to the point of lifelessness. Unable to fall back on his trademark frat-boy boorishness and chronic nudism, the former Saturday Night Live
 star retreats into somnolence. Thompson, on the other hand, is excellent as Eiffel, the novelist with a morbid worldview, and Hoffman is clearly having a ball as the unflappable professor Jules Hilbert, whom Harold seeks out so he can get some sort of handle on the sudden literary significance of his meager little life. Hilbert is both Virgil to Harold�s Dante and the most stringent aesthetic philosopher who ever roamed the halls of academia: When he reads Eiffel�s final manuscript, he declares the book a masterpiece and breaks the news to poor Harold that his death, however unfortunate, is essential to the novel�s artistic vitality. Art is beyond morality, he argues, and true art will outlive us all, so what�s one life sacrificed in the name of creative greatness?


In "Stranger Than Fiction," Will Ferrell plays Harold Crick , an IRS auditor whose life is a bore. Every day he brushes his teeth using the same number of strokes and gallops across the street at a pace that never varies. He has no friends, no ostensible interests, and while my hand couldn't reach from my seat to his neck up on screen, I'd bet Harold doesn't have much of a pulse either.
This stultifying greeting card of a movie wants to correct that. One day he hears a pinched British voice and, to his annoyance, it narrates his every move, reveals his every thought, and catalog s his many fastidious habits (slick diagrams pop up on screen to reiterate what the narrator tells us).
The voice isn't God's. It's Emma Thompson 's, and this film marks the first time I've wished she'd shut up. Moping with condescending teenage sullenness, Thompson plays Karen Eiffel , a miserably frustrated bestselling author, whose novel-in-progress, "Death and Taxes," happens to star an unwitting Harold. So the picture -- which, after all, wants to be a comedy -- is divided between two exasperating cliches: a joyless tax man and a blocked writer.
As the author considers a way to kill off her fictional creation, the actual Harold slowly arises from his stupor and dares to take a bite out of life -- or at least the cookies the prickly baker he's auditing (Maggie Gyllenhaal ) forces him to eat. "Stranger Than Fiction" aspires to ingenuity, but the cosmic tension between Karen and Harold's dueling objectives is underwhelming. Even after he hears her mention his "imminent death," Harold's determination to live doesn't wake the movie up. It gets sluggish and simple.
While Karen snaps at the assistant (Queen Latifah ) her publisher has sent to ensure her new book's completion, Harold visits a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman ), who can't begin to counsel or cure him until he determines whether Harold is in a comedy or a tragedy. To that end, Harold keeps a running notepad tally. When Gyllenhaal's character, whom Harold adores, doesn't laugh at a joke, he chalks one up for tragedy. Needless to say, this might be the biggest literary misapprehension since Alanis Morissette 's "Ironic."
Real irony, though, is out of the reach of screenwriter Zach Helm and director Marc Forster . Instead, they strain for the arch surrealist structure and metaphysical curlicues of a Charlie Kaufman picture. (Occasionally, the film cuts away to a little boy on a bike and a woman who drives a bus; they'll come in handy for the overwrought climax.) Watching the movie made me long for the big , risky ideas and entertainingly fearless filmmaking in David O. Russell's "I Heart Huckabees " and Spike Jonze's "Adaptation ," which Kaufman wrote. Both were similarly conceptual escapades, but they let it all hang out.
"Stranger Than Fiction" 
is uptight. Helm is clearly pro-love and happy endings, but he's short on loose, fresh ideas. And Forster, whose last movie was the unnavigable thriller "Stay," is, at heart, a sentimentalist. Having made both "Monster's Ball" and "Finding Neverland," he seems to cherish platitudes, and Helm's script contains a staggering variety. At some point, Harold buys a guitar, and Karen's narration tells us that he "did that which the unrelenting lyrics of those numerous punk rock songs told him. Harold Crick lived his life."
Will anyone find that as revelatory as the filmmakers do?
The casting is so conventional that you can imagine the actors were hired by committee. Only Hoffman really seems to relish his role, which is ultimately just a conceit . Still, the right people have the wrong parts. Why not let Thompson play the auditor and have Ferrell play Hoffman's part? Hoffman could breathe life and wisdom into Latifah's thankless assistant, while she plays the baker, and Gyllenhaal plays Karen. If that doesn't make a better movie, it at least makes one I haven't already seen.
Some scenes, however, no actor can save. Gyllenhaal tells Ferrell she dropped out of Harvard Law because, "if I was going to make the world a better place, I'd do it with cookies." By this point, the only reason for an audience to remain seated is to discover which letters of the alphabet sponsored the movie.


         Will Ferrell dials it down a notch in the smart, low-key 'Stranger Than Fiction.'Existence, identity, free will and narrative theory collide in the fanciful comedy "Stranger Than Fiction." Written by Zach Helm and directed by "Finding Neverland's" Marc Forster, the film explores some of the same metaphysical terrain that screenwriter Charlie Kaufman has in "Being John Malkovich" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" but in a slightly more conventional and linear way. In fact, if screenwriting impresario Robert McKee — whose paradigmatic theories Kaufman lampooned in "Adaptation" — were to take a stab at rewriting Kaufman, the result might be something like this.
 
  When we meet "Stranger's" sad sack protagonist Harold Crick, he's a man who examines little about his life, let alone grander philosophical questions. His mind is too full of numbers. The numbers that his coworkers at the IRS throw out at him to nimbly multiply and spit out with the efficiency of a calculator, the number of strokes he uses to brush his teeth, the number of steps he takes to reach the bus, etc. Played by the usually manic Will Ferrell, Harold is a buttoned-down tax man for whom a life of quiet desperation would be an improvement. Then one day, he hears The Voice.
 


         






    It's not an unfriendly voice (it belongs to Emma Thompson), and it narrates the events of Harold's life — but with a better vocabulary, as he later points out. When he does something, The Voice describes it. When he stops, so does The Voice. This turn of events, which is tied to a somewhat magical wristwatch, jars Harold from his routine existence and stirs him to action.
 
  A refreshingly grown-up comedy, "Stranger" is a charming film that is unafraid to be low-key in ways that studio releases seldom are. A large part of that is due to the willfully gentle performance of Ferrell, who is always eminently more watchable when he plays sweet and childlike — think "Elf" — than in his more overbearing roles. Like many clowns, he is seldom more interesting than when he wears the sad face.
 
  Stirred from his near-catatonic way of life by his newfound self-awareness, Harold has sanity-challenging encounters with two therapists — one of whom (Tom Hulce) thinks Harold needs a hug, while the other diagnoses him as schizophrenic and suggests medication. Even though Harold knows he isn't crazy, he is distressed by the emotions that begin to bubble to the surface, the most vexing of which is his attraction to a bohemian baker named Ana (the always engaging Maggie Gyllenhaal) whom he is auditing because she refuses to pay the portion of her taxes that go toward things like war.
 
  Harold concludes that his problem is less mental than literary and proceeds to visit the delightfully analytical English professor Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman). A variation on the dim bulb Ferrell has specialized in since his "Saturday Night Live" days, Harold is initially immersed in a "Rain Man"-like fog of obsessive-compulsive behavior. It's a wonder to watch his inhibitions melt away as he pursues a relationship with Ana and, with the help of the puckish Hilbert, works through the literary puzzle his life has become, trying to determine whether it's a comedy or a tragedy. When he helpfully points out that The Voice speaks in the "third-person omniscient," it's a victory for English teachers everywhere.
 
  In a parallel story, we are introduced to a stalled novelist named Karen "Kay" Eiffel (Thompson), who appears to be writing a novel about a character named.... Harold Crick. Just as the persistence of The Voice forces Harold toward an awakening, Kay, abetted by the no-nonsense assistant (Queen Latifah) provided by her publisher, struggles to overcome a decadelong bout of writer's block and discover the perfect way to kill off her main character. Thus Harold is left to face what might be the ultimate existential obstacle: his own mortality.
 
  The film's star-laden ensemble attacks the material with deadpan glee, grounding its quirky characters in the reality of the predicament at hand. Thompson's writer is a neurotic jangle of nerves who spits in a tissue before snuffing out her cigarettes but diligently researches the various ways Harold might meet his maker. Hoffman is the meticulous scholar whose secondary responsibilities include serving as a faculty lifeguard (reading Sue Grafton from his perch above the pool). Gyllenhaal makes civil disobedience seem common-sensical (not to mention sexy).
 
  Clever throughout, "Stranger" will merit year-end awards consideration, especially for writing and acting. It manages to be smart and surprising and provides this season of serious movies with a much-needed shot of whimsy. As technology threatens to limit human contact, it's refreshing to see a film in which the big questions are handled in an entertaining and thoughtful manner that encourages non-electronic interconnectivity. It may not answer any big questions, but it makes considering them more fun.

It used to be that when a comedian turned serious, he got sticky and sentimental  (Charlie Chaplin, Jerry Lewis, Robin Williams). Now, thanks to Jim Carrey in The Truman Show , the day the clown cried has given way to the day the clown went hip and minimalist and postmodern. Stranger Than Fiction , an eminently easy-to-watch piece of one-joke pop japery, is a movie that mimics the I'm-a-character-in-my-own-life metaphysical playfulness of The Truman Show  as well as the wheels-within-wheels cleverness of a Charlie Kaufman contraption like Adaptation   with, it must be said, far less art or imagination than either. How do we know that Harold Crick (Will Ferrell), the pathologically cautious and mild hero, is the Compleat Nerd, a new-millennium Walter Mitty who's deathly in need of liberating  his inner pleasure-seeker? We know it because he gets up each morning at the same time, cleans his teeth with the same number of brushstrokes, and takes the same number of steps to the bus  a ritualized existence the film illustrates, rather charmingly, with flat-screen computer diagrams that pop out of Harold's head and quiver around him, as if his brain were a piece of software.
I should add that Harold eats alone, sleeps alone, and does everything else in his sterile, immaculate apartment alone. That he not only works as an IRS agent but likes his job . That his story is related to us by a narrator who speaks in tones of such orotund English plumminess that she might be Mary Poppins reading from Peter Pan . And that Ferrell, wearing a stylized flattop (that hair signifies the fizzy soul he's suppressing), plays Harold by reducing his elastic face to a doughy blank and generally giving him the demeanor of a functional low-level depressive.
One morning, as he's counting toothbrush strokes, Harold stops in the middle of everything. Suddenly, he can hear  the narrator. He's listening, moment by moment, to the story of his life, and he doesn't much like what he hears, especially when it turns out that the story's mysterious creator, a reclusive novelist named Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), is planning to kill him off. Since Harold is already such an abstract bureaucratic nowhere man, there's very little resonance to learning that he exists inside somebody's fiction. He seems thinner than life to begin with.
Yet there's no denying the movie has a surface allure. The director, Marc Forster (Finding Neverland  ), shoots Zach Helm's Kaufman Lite script in candy colors and at vivid angles, and he gets infectious performances out of Maggie Gyllenhaal  as the testy-adorable ''progressive'' bakery owner who lures Harold from his shell; Dustin  Hoffman as the jovial academic who helps him crack the mystery of the narrator; and Thompson, who makes the frazzled, chain-smoking author the most passionate presence in the movie. As for Ferrell, he gets points for taking a chance, but the next time he goes serious, he should try to do it in a movie that allows him to stay true to the excitable inner life that made him a star.

 “Stranger Than Fiction” gives Will Ferrell the kind of opportunity that movie and television clowns seem to cherish, which is to impress audiences with their restraint. Robin Williams does it every now and then, as does Jim Carrey — Bill Murray does nothing else these days — and now Mr. Ferrell, among the most uninhibited and dementedly spontaneous comic actors around, straightens his spine, buttons his lip and stares straight ahead. Perhaps without quite knowing it, the audience waits for a wink, a hint that some of the madcap spirit that animated pictures like “Talladega Nights,” “Old School,” “Anchorman” and “Elf” might be lurking inside the sober suit and diffident manner.  It is to Mr. Ferrell’s credit, and the movie’s, that he manages to be interesting without mugging or riffing, but rather by playing a highly controlled man in an impressively controlled manner. Harold Crick, who lives alone in a spartan apartment in an unspecified city (Chicago, it looks like), is an I.R.S. auditor who obeys an  unvarying routine. At least, that is, until the musings of the film’s voice-over narrator become audible not just to the audience but to Harold as well. Irked by the dry, British, female voice in his head, he is driven to seek out its source. He eventually discovers that he is a character in a novel being written by Karen Eiffel (an antic Emma Thompson), who is chain-smoking her way through an epic case of writer’s block, helped by a no-nonsense emissary from her publisher played by Queen Latifah.  The audience is aware of Harold’s situation long before he is, an example of dramatic irony, as we learn from Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), the English professor Harold turns to for help. I confess that I cannot be too hard on a movie that insists on the usefulness of literary theory, even though I was puzzled to see a book of “healthy dessert” recipes on Professor Hilbert’s office shelves. (Especially since the man seems to live on reheated, recycled coffee.)  But the professor, whom Mr. Hoffman impersonates with sly, absent-minded mischief, also functions as the movie’s internal critic. He takes its charmingly absurd premise seriously and thus enables the screenwriter, Zach Helm, and the director, Marc Forster (“Finding Neverland,” “Monster’s Ball”), to finesse some logical fuzziness. It’s never quite clear, for instance, what the parameters of Karen and Harold’s author-character relationship are. Did she call him into being ex nihilo? Does he have memories of things that happened before the novel (called “Death and Taxes”) commenced? Is he free, as long as she is blocked, to do things she does not intend or know about, or is she, in her role as narrator, strictly omniscient?  These questions preoccupy Harold less than another, basic issue, namely whether “Death and Taxes” is a comedy or a tragedy. This is a life-or-death matter for him, since he has overheard Karen foreshadow his imminent demise. The professor’s assessment is stark: citing the Italian novelist Italo Calvino, he notes that any story must fall into one of the two categories, affirming either the inevitability of death or the continuity (traditionally through the prospect of a marriage) of life.  This may be true in literature, but Hollywood has become expert at scrambling the generic codes, producing dramedies, comedic dramas and other such hybrids. And while “Stranger Than Fiction” traffics in a bit of darkly funny existential anxiety, it also finds room for romantic fantasy and sentimental uplift. Harold’s identity crisis converges with the flowering of a crush on Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a baker who refuses to pay some of her taxes out of political  principle. Harold approaches her at first with agonized timidity and then with a bit more boldness, showing up at her bakery with an assortment of flours.  That’s a nice, whimsical touch, as is the guitar serenade that leads to a fumbling, ardent first kiss. There are also a few moments of pleasantly jarring absurdity that deepen the film’s evident debt to Charlie  Kaufman, author of “Adaptation” and “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.” But there is also something soft and unfinished about the movie; it wanders about in its own conceit, collecting stray moments of intelligence or feeling without adding up to very much. The ending is a nicely executed bit of metaphysical farce, in which all the strands of Harold’s fate converge, but the final notes are more than a little false. Rather than jarring or deepening your perceptions of the world, “Stranger Than Fiction” settles into a cozy, comforting realm that really isn’t very strange at all.  But that just may be what a critic is supposed to think; it’s what Jules Hilbert might say if he were writing this review from inside my head. And for all I know, he is.  “Stranger Than Fiction” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some disturbing images, sexual situations and strong language.
Once an actor gets big enough to take whatever kind of role he wants, it makes sense that the biggest stretch imaginable, given his current situation, is the part of a powerless loser. Call it a "nice" moviea vehicle designed to subvert the very mania that gives the star his juice. Stranger Than Fiction  is Will Ferrell 's nice movie in the sense that The Truman Show  was Jim Carrey 's, and it comes at roughly the same point in his career.
Ferrell's aggression is less overt than Carrey'sso was Genghis Khan 'sbut it's there in that Bullwinkle frame. His supporting role in Old School  provided the template for most of his starring vehicles: alpha males with omega self-awareness, softies who take to machismo like a baby to lead paint chips.
Stranger Than Fiction  plays up the moony softness that Ferrell usually plays against. As Harold Crick , an obsessive-compulsive IRS  agent (forgive the redundancy), he's introduced as the kind of benumbed mope who notes day after day the number of steps to the bus stop. This we know because a disembodied voice on the soundtrack spells out each of Harold's idiosyncrasies. Then Harold hears it too.
This moment, at which Marc Forster 's movie flies off into metafictional fancy, isn't the comic haymaker it should be, but it's enough to send Harold into a panicky tailspin, which becomes a nosedive after he flubs an audit meeting with a tattooed baker (Maggie Gyllenhaal ). Meanwhile, as Harold rails against the narrator in his head, reclusive author Kay Eiffel  (Emma Thompson ) tries to chain-smoke her way out of writer's block as she struggles with her long-delayed novelwhich points toward the death of a mope named Harold Crick.
Many minds have  compared Zach Helm 's zigzagging script to the work of Charlie Kaufman , whose name has become shorthand for self-reflexive gamesmanship with screenwriting convention. The difference seems obvious. Kaufman's scripts anchor their craziest conceits in something actual: the real John Malkovich , the real Chuck Barris , even the real Charlie Kaufmannot to mention real anguish and alienation. Stranger Than Fiction  merely layers whimsy upon whimsy. As written, Harold Crick is no more convincing a human being than he is an IRS agent; Kay Eiffel's writing, supposedly good enough to inspire the career-long devotion of a literature professor (Dustin Hoffman ), sounds as dully declamatory as movie-trailer narration.
And yet when the actors enter Helm's artificial constructs, some small miracle happens. I don't believe that of all the songs he could use to woo the baker, the taxman would dust off Wreckless Eric's "Whole Wide World." But the way Ferrell performs itplunking sweetly on two strings of an electric guitar in a smitten trancerivals John Cusack  holding aloft his boombox. And however absurd it seems for the baker, Ana, to fall for her sad-sack auditorhow often you wanna bet that happens?Gyllenhaal redeems the contrivance with dizzy charm. These performances succeed where Harold fails: gaining a life independent of their author.
