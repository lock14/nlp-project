Just because Ferrell is game for anything that might draw a laugh, it doesn't mean the comedian and leading (funny)man should follow through with every idea that comes his way. Blades of Glory
, although mildly amusing, has the dank odor of having gone to the well once too often: Ooh, let's dress up Ferrell like an elf � or an anchorman or a NASCAR driver � and see what happens. There's more concept than execution in Blades of Glory
, which squishes Ferrell's flabby body into an ice skater's spandex and then runs on the weak narrative fumes left over from Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby
 and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy
. Again Ferrell is given a goofy name, Chazz Michael Michaels, and again his poor conduct gets him into trouble with the officials of the sport or job, and again the character's homophobia (the subject of many sniggering jokes) is resolved with a literal big kiss or a figurative skate into the heavens. (The ending of Blades of Glory
 is just plain bizarre.) A slugfest between Michaels and his chief rival, Jimmy MacElroy (Napoleon Dynamite
's Heder), gets the two banned from competitive ice skating, but after three years a loophole is discovered that allows them to skate again competitively, but only as a precedent-setting male pair. (Let the guffaws begin.) But for all the laughs predicated on crotch-to-face leaps and poses, there are also a few genuinely funny sequences � for instance, a chase in ice skates while on dry land and the memorable conclusion to the infamous Iron Lotus trick. Solid support comes from Arnett and Poehler as Chazz and Jimmy's new archrivals (the incestuous brother-sister skate duo, Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg), the always reliable Nelson as � what else � a coach, and a slew of cameos that includes everyone from Andy Richter and Luke Wilson to a host of real skaters (among them Nancy Kerrigan, Brian Boitano, Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming, Scott Hamilton, and Sasha Cohen) and sports announcer Jim Lampley. Still, most of the gags are pretty tired and predictable, and feel like filler in what is already a pretty minimal story line. Ferrell's bloated belly and flabby physique make the actor pretty unbelievable as a professional athlete, which, I guess, is part of the joke. But it ultimately becomes a question of physics and aerodynamics: Is it really possible for a person to waddle on ice? Through the magic of movies, the answer is yes.


Will Ferrell's latest haphazard treat, "Blades of Glory," is a farce set in the world of competitive figure skating. The film is quick, painless, and more than a little brave: not since John Travolta, Jamie Lee Curtis, and the aerobicizers in "Perfect" has so much Lycra been so abused for our pleasure.
Ferrell plays a boozy, womanizing skating star called Chazz Michael Michaels , who teams up with his blonder, more fey rival, Jimmy MacElroy (Jon Heder ), to conquer pairs competition, after a fight gets them banned from male singles for life.
These two have less than six months to get into medal-winning shape for this movie's version of the Winter Olympics. They train in a large Denver storage locker with Craig T. Nelson as their coach (he's doing a crusty riff on his old ABC sitcom). For dance instruction, they turn to a patient choreographer (Romany Malco ) whose studio is full of annoyed black dancers. The duo's biggest challenge -- after adjusting to crotch lifts -- is mastering a literal death-spiral routine called Iron Lotus. It decapitated half of the Korean pair that previously tried it.
While Michaels and MacElroy practice, their American rivals, Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg , a flamboyantly sleazy brother-sister team, played by Will Arnett and Amy Poehler (who are husband and wife), manipulate their drab sister Katie (Jenna Fischer ) into spying. This is Boris and Natasha stuff, but it's often very funny. Their skate routines are funnier. One is a thug number to Marky Mark that, hilariously, has Arnett in a pair of Timberland skates.
Not every moment scores. A romance between Katie and MacElroy gives the picture some of its flatter scenes. Fischer plays the indecisive Pam on NBC's "The Office," and her comic strengths and Heder's are their reactions to other comedians. Heder often looks like he's smelled something awful. And Fischer's m.o. is coquettish embarrassment. Together, they make as much sense as two baseball catchers on the field at the same time.
As long as it's near the ice, "Blades of Glory," which was written by four people and directed by two, sticks a lot of its landings. The bit players are well used, especially Nick Swardson as an effeminate stalker and William Fichtner as Jimmy's spiteful sponsor and adoptive father.
The movie itself is not the merciless send-up of figure skating the ads make it appear to be. (For one thing, Johnny Weir has worn nuttier costumes than almost anything that appears here.) Like "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Ferrell's NASCAR party from last year, "Blades of Glory" embraces a sport and, in its own fantastical way, dares that sport to open its mind.
"Talladega Nights" made us take (somewhat) seriously the gay French driver played by Sacha Baron Cohen -- at least as Ferrell's comedic and athletic equal.
Michaels and MacElroy may just be doing D.B. Sweeney and Moira Kelly in 1992's he-skates-she-skates romantic comedy "The Cutting Edge." But their movie forces you to think it ridiculous that the sport has no same-sex pairs. This might be a moral matter (dudes together on ice?) or just one of simple physics: Can a dude throw-jump another dude? "Blades of Glory" makes it seem possible, regardless.
And the fact that skaters Peggy Fleming , Dorothy Hamill , Nancy Kerrigan , Sasha Cohen , and Brian Boitano have cameos and that Scott Hamilton commentates on the movie's absurd routines with his usual melodrama feels like a show of support.
Strictly speaking, of course, Michaels and MacElroy aren't gay. Yet unlike "Wild Hogs," the movie doesn't care if you think they are. Not that anyone here seems to care about something as mundane as orientation. "Blades of Glory" is just gayish, with an even more outlandish finale than "Talladega Nights."
Somehow Ferrell has become our chief satirist of masculinity. And with that NASCAR movie and this new one, he's turned Hollywood's garden variety homophobia into giddy homophilia, giving the world a pair of movies any queen could enjoy alongside his frat-house buddies.



         Based on the number of prominent cameos by figure skating royalty in the pas de deux comedy "Blades of Glory," the world of toe loops, double axels and triple lutzes has a pretty good sense of humor. And that's a good thing because the movie, which stars Will Ferrell and Jon Heder as rival skaters forced to team up, leaves no sacred cow or salchow untipped (although it appears to be devoid of Dick Button references).
 
 Olympic champions Scott Hamilton, Dorothy Hamill, Peggy Fleming and Brian Boitano, among other skating luminaries, lend a degree of contrasting verisimilitude to the otherwise farcical proceedings that include a terrifically macabre variation on the death spiral. "Blades" is an often hysterical parody as long as bodies are in motion, nailing the compulsories of a sport ripe for caricature, but skates on thinner ice outside the rink.
 


         






   Ferrell plays alcoholic sex addict Chazz Michael Michaels, an über-macho cross between Jim Morrison, a taller, doughier Elvis Stojko and one of the Hanson brothers from "Slap Shot." Heder is the ambiguously elfin Jimmy MacElroy, an orphan raised to bio-engineered perfection by his adoptive father (William Fichtner), with a trademark move called the Galloping Peacock replete with plumed costume.
 
 After Chazz and Jimmy tie for the men's singles gold medal at the Olympic-like World Wintersport Games, they engage in an ungentlemanly brawl on the awards podium that results in them being banned from competition for life. A loophole in the rules, however, allows them to restart their careers 3 1/2 years later as the first male-male pairs skating team.
 
 Ferrell and Heder make good comedy foils, the latter freshening what feels increasingly like a formula turn for the film's ostensible star. Chazz's boorishness is balanced by Jimmy's waifish pluckiness, and just when you want to slap one or the other upside the head, someone usually does.
 
 Although the film makes comic fodder of these two extreme opposites on the chain of masculinity, there's not much to it beyond the obvious sight gags and innuendo. The filmmakers may be making some generic point about the warring masculine and feminine aspects within every male, but they were far more interested in the high-concept idea of two men flinging each other across the ice.
 
 The movie is at its funniest and most original when zinging the sometimes pretentious milieu of competitive figure skating. Whatever combination of choreography, camera trickery and special effects were required to render the over-the-top, hyper-real skate numbers, they're executed with wit and ingenuity.
 
  The off-ice shenanigans, however, including a subplot involving Jimmy's infatuation with the younger sister (Jenna Fischer of "The Office") of the reigning pairs champions, are sluggish and lose much of the momentum generated by the skating.
 
 If a lot of the dialogue is rather earthbound, the performers soar when throwing themselves into the on-ice routines. The two leads are gleefully matched in their enthusiasm by real-life husband-and-wife Will Arnett and Amy Poehler as Chazz and Jimmy's archrivals, the brother-sister team of Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg. Arnett has a maniacal grin plastered on his face that seems eerily ripped from some Winter Olympics gone by.
 
 In keeping with the pairs theme, the movie was scripted by a pair of twosomes, Jeff Cox and Craig Cox, and John Altschuler and Dave Krinsky (from a story by the Coxes and Busy Philipps), and directed by the duo responsible for the Geico cavemen commercials, Will Speck and Josh Gordon.
 
 
 "Blades of Glory." MPAA rating: PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language, a comic violent image and some drug references. Running time: 1 hour, 33 minutes. In general release.   

In Blades of Glory , Jon Heder, he of the adorable rabbit teeth and gently peeved nasal whine, may have ditched his Napoleon Dynamite  curls, but he still knows how to take a cue from his hair  in this case, a frosted '70s princess mop that makes him look like Sandy Duncan with a touch of Marcia Wallace on the old Bob Newhart Show . As Jimmy MacElroy, a figure skater known for his seamless twirls and glides, Heder is introduced in a skintight peacock getup of resplendent silliness, bedecked with giant sequins and a big, flaming tail. When he flaps his ''wings'' to  the soaring strains of ''Con Te Partirò'' it may be wrong to say so, but I'll say it anyway:  He looks about as gay as a jaybird in May.
Will Ferrell, with those dots of eyes furrowed into mean slits, is Chazz Michael Michaels, Jimmy's butch counterpart  a pudgy, cantankerous ruffian who skates with cowboy/bruiser/Saturday Night Fever  moves that are, if anything, just a bit less ridiculous than Jimmy's peacock posing. Chazz tends his dirty biker hair with horse shampoo and tosses horny insults at anyone who doesn't see his macho splendor. He's also a sex addict who, when he spots Nancy Kerrigan, hits her with the line ''You an official here? Because you have officially given me a boner!'' That sums up Ferrell's performance: As Chazz, he's a tool, though that doesn't mean he's anything less than a girly man on ice.
At the World Wintersport Games, Chazz and Jimmy share the gold medal, and when their appearance on the podium turns into a brawl, both are banned from solo competitive skating for life. But there's a loophole: They can still compete in teams, and since no one wants to partner with either of the disgraced duo, they put their mutual hatred on hold to become the first male-male figure-skating team in the history of the sport.
Giggling at the pouffy-sleeved, muscle-buffed vanity of male figure skaters may be a bit of a cheap shot, but as cheap shots go, it isn't a bad one. Blades of Glory  is a farce of preening emasculation in spandex. It is also, undeniably, a mild comedy of homosexual panic, though in a place as sexually clenched as America, no one, from either the left or the right, has much to fear from a good, honest gay-anxiety joke. Remember the one that popped up in the middle of the Super Bowl  that commercial with two  men nibbling away at different ends of a candy bar, only to end up in a kiss? It tickled you in two directions at once, turning homophobia into a sly what if?  There are moments in Blades of Glory  with a similar effect. Basically, though, this is a one-joke movie, directed by Will Speck and Josh Gordon with zero visual sparkle and too much dead weight between its handful of nimble sequences.
When Chazz and Jimmy hit the ice together, it's the payoff we've been waiting for, and the movie doesn't disappoint. Ferrell and Heder, who did some of their own skating, are digitally blended with stunt doubles, which gives them the look of an Olympiad Siegfried & Roy. Chazz, to his horror, finds his face opposite body parts he never wanted to be half that close to, and the duet's poses are ripe indeed, especially when Jimmy takes on the figure of a swan getting lovingly...goosed. The movie is funniest when it aims for doofy-surreal balletic farce  when it revels in lyrical slapstick and turns into a comedy of movement, of men gone femme.
Off the ice, though, Blades of Glory  is cautious and rather flat. I kept wishing that the film had been directed by Christopher Guest, the Farrelly brothers, or the Ben Stiller of Zoolander , who did zingier, nut-brained riffs on the vacuousness of fashion-world metrosexuality. (Stiller is one of the producers here.) It's time for Will Ferrell to stop letting his belly hang out  or, at least, to stop thinking that doing so is enough to qualify for a ''fearless'' laugh. His macho send-up made sense in Talladega Nights , but he plays Chazz as such a toxic bullhead (would someone like this become a figure skater?) that he seems to be overcompensating for the effeminacy of the subject. As for Heder, he finds few shadings within his honeyed passivity.
Blades of Glory  has its diversions, like Amy Poehler and Will Arnett as the brother-sister team of Fairchild and Stranz Van Waldenberg, who are such arrested babies they don't even realize they're in lust with each other. Arnett, especially, gives his evil skating dandy a touch of antic depravity, and there's a good bit where he and Ferrell hobble through a lobby on skates in a riotously clunky chase. Blades of Glory  has funny moves even when its characters can barely move, but the film seldom gets past its one basic laugh: that a real man figure-skating is a contradiction in terms.

 Will Ferrell is a ferocious marshmallow. In his dumb but endearing sports comedies, the spirit may be willing, but the flesh is flabby. As he ricochets from triumph to humiliation and back, he suggests an armchair George Plimpton whose characters, driven by an outlandish grandiosity, are deeply reassuring. For the sake of his career, Mr. Ferrell should never join a gym; buffed up, he would cease being one of us.  In “Blades of Glory” his character  — Chazz Michael Michaels, a preening rock ’n’ roll-style figure skater, hard drinker and self-proclaimed sex addict — is quintessential Ferrell: a macho caricature with a gooey sweet filling that leaks through the cracks of his heavy-metal armor. As he lurches and lunges through a routine to the roar of the Billy Squier anthem “The Stroke,” Chazz is almost fearsome. But by the end of this fast, light, frequently funny comedy, your instinct is to pet his mullet and go “Awwww.”  Mr. Ferrell and Jon Heder (of “Napoleon Dynamite”) play rival skaters who were banned from the ice following a public brawl; Mr. Heder’s character, Jimmy MacElroy, is the whiny, arrogant adopted child of a billionaire (William Fichtner) who abandons him on a roadside after his ouster from the sport. After spending three years in exile, Chazz and Jimmy re-enter figure skating the only way the rules allow: as a team.  As these mismatched egomaniacs develop a fraternal bond, their chemistry jells, and Mr. Ferrell and Mr. Heder stake an early claim to being the comedy couple of the year. Jimmy, with his fleecy platinum hair and downy cheeks,  is a brat itching for a comeuppance, and Mr. Heder’s Bugs Bunny teeth and myopic gaze complete the picture of the sports prodigy as idiotic, self-centered robot. The character seems only a hair’s-breadth away from Napoleon Dynamite.  It comes as a huge relief to find that as “Blades of Glory” speeds along, it avoids going to the obvious, ugly place for cheap laughs. The notion of a male figure-skating team in which one member is a chest-beating, fire-breathing Lothario and the other a persnickety, virginal girly-man cries out for the kind of easy,  gay-baiting jokes that mars comedies like “Wild Hogs.”  It’s not that “Blades of Glory” is entirely unaware of its largely untapped subtext. In Sarah Kawahara’s amusing ice skating choreography, sliding scissor kicks land faces in crotches, and groins grind into groins. But the humor lies more in the ooh-that-must-hurt category than in any suggestion that such collisions might be sexy.  The movie’s satirical take on competitive figure skating, from its music for gliding pas des deux (Andrea Bocelli) to the goofy absurdity of children’s ice shows in which Chazz, exiled from competition, is forced to work, to its tacky space-age costumes, is affectionately knowing.  When Chazz and Jimmy make their comeback, they are pitted against a ruthless European brother-sister team with an incestuous bond, the Van Waldenbergs (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler), who blackmail their meek sister (Jenna Fischer) into using her charms to break up the American partners. This is one of several subplots shoehorned into the movie for strictly mechanical reasons.  The Van Waldenbergs have a potentially great comic moment near the end of the movie that is all but thrown away. In their breathtakingly tasteless routine at the movie’s version of the Winter Olympics, they impersonate John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe as lovers on ice. Alas, all the movie gives us is about 30 seconds of what might have been a classic, “Borat”-worthy sketch.  More successful are a drawn-out stumbling chase on skates through the streets of Montreal, and Chazz and Jimmy’s decision to execute an extremely dangerous (and funny)  maneuver developed in North Korea.  Despite its missed opportunities, “Blades of Glory” introduces some fresh talent into the Hollywood comedy pool. Its directors, Will Speck and Josh Gordon, come from advertising, having created those ubiquitous television commercials for Geico insurance. However tired of the Geico caveman you may be, you must admit that the campaign, when new, had a rare spark of wit. “Blades of Glory” has enough vestiges of that kind of creative cheek to keep you contentedly in your seat.  “Blades of Glory” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has off-color sexual humor and some strong language. 

What are two hockey pucks doing in a film about figure skating? Will Ferrell and Jon Heder star as rivals-turned-partners in "Blades of Glory," a movie that was a hit as soon as the posters went up. Ferrell in a body stocking. Heder in a bleached-blond hairdo the likes of which haven't been seen since "The Mary Tyler Moore Show." There may be an overabundance of pain jokes, crotch jokes and painful crotch jokes, but at the end of the program, this Will Speck-Josh Gordon-directed farce is the triple axel of comedy. Even if the heroes do fall down a lot.
There may be no aspect of modern life that eventually won't be sat on by the professionally ungainly Ferrell, who has wrapped his half-shaved bear of a self around Christmas ("Elf"), TV news ("Anchorman") and NASCAR ("Talladega Nights") over the past few years. (He will turn his dubious attentions toward the NBA in the upcoming "Semi-Pro.") Meanwhile, squatting upon the seemingly genteel world of ice skating, Ferrell is in his element: a walking (gliding) contradiction, the personification of physical unease dropped into the world's most graceful sport.
Ferrell plays Chazz Michael Michaels, the bad boy of the rink, an overly oiled sex machine who resembles a late-era Jim Morrison and needs only a mid-rink dance pole to complete his mutation from skater to stripper. Jimmy MacElroy (Heder), his chief rival, is his polar opposite: As a child prodigy, Jimmy was adopted by skating promoter Darren MacElroy (a marvelously unctuous William Fichtner) and raised to be an "uber-skater," whose entire act is so effeminate it can only raise a sneer from Chazz.
Naturally, they will become partners, in a "Zoolander"-inspired parade of posing, spinning, camel-ing and lutzing, but only after a total meltdown. Having tied for gold at a (fictitious) world competition, Chazz and Jimmy jostle, shove and topple off the podium, wrestling around on the ice, to the horror of computer-multiplied thousands. Ultimately, they are banned for life by a committee that includes Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Brian Boitano and Nancy Kerrigan.
Chazz becomes even more of a drunk, performing in a children's ice show and throwing up inside his costume (he's like Bad Santa in cold storage), while Jimmy goes to work in a skate shop. They are on their way to becoming either has-beens or sports announcers when Coach (an apt name for Craig T. Nelson's character) comes up with a scheme: The two may well be banned from men's singles, but not from doubles. Nothing in the rules says skating partners have to be male and female, so why don't they return to the ice as the first same-sex team on the international circuit? Holy Adam and Steve!
The conflict in the film -- as if there weren't enough already -- arrives via the archly villainous and vaguely incestuous brother-sister duo of Stranz & Fairchild Van Waldenberg (real-life marrieds Will Arnett and Amy Poehler), the reigning king and queen of pairs skating. Fairchild will do anything to keep her position as empress of the ice; Stranz is too stupid to do anything but follow her lead, and further oppress their younger sister, Katie (Jenna Fischer), the good girl who becomes Jimmy's love interest.
As good as Ferrell and Heder are, without such potent supporting characters, "Blades of Glory" would never score quite as high as it no doubt will at the box office. Nor would it succeed as well without the subtly awkward special effects -- the skating, by Ferrell, Heder, Poehler and Arnett, is just this side of totally plausible. The technology undoubtedly exists to make a Teamster skate like Sasha Cohen (who has a very funny cameo), but the laughs would be lost without a certain amount of nod and wink about the relation between these actors and the ice.
The one drawback is that the implicit movie-long gag, about how ridiculous it is to watch men dance with each other, may strike some auds as one long, unspoken but obvious gay joke -- and they wouldn't be far off.
Production qualities are first-rate, and the costumes by Julie Weiss are informed by a knowledge of how ostentatious skaters' outfits really are -- her work is all the more hilarious for it.
Again, the very idea of Will Ferrell on figure skates was a high-scoring concept before it ever left the pitch meeting. Don't expect much, except laughs.
