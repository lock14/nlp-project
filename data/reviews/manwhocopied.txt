ntil it makes a screeching hairpin turn from social realism into noirish fantasy, Jorge Furtado's film "The Man Who Copied" appears to be a sober kitchen-sink portrait of working-class life in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. As its 20-year-old narrator, Andr� (L�zaro Ramos), who lives with his mother, describes his daily routine as a photocopier, you realize sadly that he is one of millions of bright, frustrated young Latin Americans looking at a dead-end future. Andr�'s dry-eyed analysis of his financial predicament offers a detailed dollars-and-cents picture of an existence one step above poverty. A major obstacle to a brighter future was his expulsion from high school after he hit a fellow student over the head with a bottle. Since then, his education has been reduced to retaining scraps of knowledge from the documents he copies. For Andr� to succeed with women, he needs enough money to go on dates, which his budget prohibits. His curvaceous co-worker, Marin�s (Luana Piovani), a constant temptation, remains tauntingly out of reach. A technical virgin, keenly aware of her marketable assets, she is the first to admit that she is holding out for a rich husband. One of Andr�'s only luxuries is a pair of binoculars he uses to study the residents of the opposite building, and he develops a crush on a young woman he spies on nightly. When he finally meets this secret love, S�lvia (Leandra Leal), in a women's clothing store where she works as an assistant, she appears to be a shy, girlish creature even more na�ve and fumbling than he. As their cautious friendship develops, she reveals a literary streak and knowledgeably quotes Shakespeare; Andr�, who fancies himself a cartoonist, in turn draws a picture of her. What seems to be a modest little movie turns inside out the moment Andr� decides to counterfeit a $50 bill and, in the most suspenseful sequence, succeeds in changing it at a lottery. The temptation to go for broke proves irresistible. And with Cardoso (Pedro Cardoso), a casual acquaintance who pines after Marin�s like a puppy dog but can't afford her, he plunges into counterfeiting, then into bank robbery, violence and homicide. The movie never recovers from its jarring turn into a rushed, unconvincing caper movie with a blas�, Robin Hood attitude. Andr�, S�lvia, Marin�s and Cardoso become a criminal band of four, intoxicated by cash, which seems to rain from the heavens into their laps. Sweet, shy S�lvia reveals a scheming dark side that is only a shade lighter than that of Barbara Stanwyck in "Double Indemnity." Marin�s and Cardoso, meanwhile, prove even more crass than we suspected, as they embark on an epic shopping spree. Andr�, almost overnight, reveals himself a sophisticated criminal strategist and master escape artist. A deeply cynical movie, "The Man Who Copied" blares out the message that wealth and happiness are not only synonymous but also worth pursuing with every last ounce of effort, letting nothing stand in the way.

A poor photocopy machine operator falls in love and starts copying money in Jorge Furtado's intermittently amusing but ultimately scattered feature bow, "The Man Who Copied." Magnetic young thesp Lazaro Ramos ("Madame Sata") handles the title role with verve and humor, but he's not enough to hold together two hours of story that swings from social realism to rags-to-riches comedy to accidental murder. A much shorter version would be a prerequisite to finding offshore audiences for this offbeat Columbia co-prod. 
Andre (Ramos) draws imaginative cartoons, but the only job he can find is pushing buttons on a copy machine. On a salary of $300 a month, he can't aspire to much. Marinez (Luana Piovani), the sexy blonde he works with, candidly admits she'll only give her virginity to a man with enough money to change her life. That also excludes the frustrated salesman (Pedro Cardoso) she dates.
Andre develops a crush on Silvia (Leandra Leal), an ordinary girl in the next building. After spying on her through binoculars, he slowly gets up the courage to talk to her. At least half the film is spent making her acquaintance, which requires him to photocopy a real 50 dollar bill. When he successfully passes on the counterfeit money, tale spins into a wholly unconvincing fantasy of bank robbery, winning the lottery, and murderous revenge.
Coolly narrated by Ramos in a deadpan voiceover, the story often provokes a smile. It is enlivened by bursts of animation, presumably from Andre's pen. Furtado does a fine job recreating the depressed social and economic scene of Porto Alegre in southern Brazil. Music, which ranges from Bach and Mozart to Creedence Clearwater Revival, also has its moments.

At long last love: Kutcher and Peet take forever to connect
A Lot Like Love  exemplifies the happiness-deferred romance, in which two friends-but-should-be-paramours repeatedly convene, separate, and reconvene over several years, finally staying together only after feature run-time has elapsed. Skimming through lonely stretches and careerist angst, the movie focuses on incidents that threaten the final hookup. But the chemistry between diaper salesman Ashton Kutcher  and photo hound Amanda Peet  is so off that the pairing scans as an alienation effectone enhanced by their age difference, as well as Peet's resemblance (in her goth, graduate-age New York scenes) to an unwaxed Demi Moore . The banter soon develops a rhythm: Hurting from a breakup, Peet gets too drunk to nuzzle and Kutcher doesn't complain; years later, on a car trip, Kutcher whines about his ex and Peet shrugs it off. Interjections from perennial second bananas Kathryn Hahn  (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days ) and Kal Penn  (winning even when not conjuring vivified bags of pot) generate the only sparks.
