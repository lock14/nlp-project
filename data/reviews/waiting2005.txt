Rightly or wrongly, they gave Tarantino hell for inspiring a raft of Reservoir Dogs
 knockoffs, all those mid-Nineties fast-talking, gun-loving crime capers du jour. I wonder then if anyone will finger Kevin Smith for providing the seedling for this rot. Clerks
 and Waiting �
 (set, natch, in the restaurant industry) share not only a premise based on the drudgery of the workplace, but also a flat visual style and a fixation on sex and all its attendant bodily fluids. But whereas Clerks
 was an inspired piece of raunch, Waiting �
 never aims higher than the urinal (indeed, one waiter�s inability to pee in public counts as a significant plot thread). The ostensible heart of the film is Dean (Long), a community-college dropout who�s seen his potential dwindle after years of service at a chain restaurant called Shenanigan�s. Dean�s lot isn�t so bad: Among his fellow waiters is his best pal, Monty (Two Guys and a Girl
�s ever-smirking Reynolds), whose defining character trait is a predilection for boning underage girls. Additionally, there�s the hot lesbian bartender (Chriqui), two wannabe-gangsta busboys (one of whom is played by cult darling Andy Milonakis), and a host of greasy-haired, loogey-shooting cooks (including Soderbergh favorite Luis Guzm�n, slumming) who pass the time by rubbing foodstuffs on their genitals and playing the "penis-showing game." The elaborate rules of that game boil down to � you got it � brandishing one�s penis (and, for extra points, one�s testicles) at unsuspecting coworkers. That�s about as funny as it gets in this frequently offensive and doggedly disgusting film. The acting hails strictly from the sitcom-school of delivery, the film is technically inept (certain stories appear to have been sliced and diced in the editing room), and the humor � in which the word "faggot" figures as 90% of the punchlines � traffics wholly in crude stereotypes. (Waiting �
 is not unlike solitary confinement with your 13-year-old little brother who may or may not be a latent homosexual � the theory going that boys who call other boys "fag" doth protest too much). While Waiting �
 does occasionally capture the in-the-trenches camaraderie of the service industry, mostly it serves as a 90-minute-long PSA on the dangers of enraging your waiter. And one last burning question: Were those stunt balls, or Guzm�n�s very own wagging at us?


Anyone who carries the psychological scars of restaurant work knows there's a great, brutal comedy to be made about the food service industry. After seeing "Waiting. . ." you'll still be waiting.
To his credit, first-time writer-director Rob McKittrick knows his surf 'n' turf: psychotic short-order chefs, dorky managers, busboys incapacitated from sucking nitrous oxide out of whipped cream cans, the unspeakable things done to food in the name of revenge on obnoxious customers. "Waiting. . ." has the potential to be the "Office Space" of restaurant comedies. Instead, it's a third-rate "Clerks," a friendly but poorly made time-waster that confuses frat-house crudity and shock gags with actual humor. Teenage boys will be in heaven. All others: Check, please.
What "Waiting. . ." gets right is the generic tackiness of formula restaurants like "Shenanigans" -- i.e., Bennigan's, Applebee's, T.G.I. Friday's -- and the soul-sucking limbo they offer to college kids unsure of what they want out of life beyond next month's rent. The movie splits its time between Dean (Justin Long), a sweet-faced community college grad watching the future pass him by, and his roommate Monty (Ryan Reynolds), a wisecracking party animal and master of food-service subversion. Showing new recruit Mitch (John Francis Daley) around his appointed stations, Monty introduces him to the large, milling cast.
They include: head cook and general reprobate Raddimus (Luis Guzman); Bishop (Chi McBride), the Yoda of the dishwasher; hypertense waitressing lifer Naomi (Alanna Ubach); jailbait hostess Natascha (Vanessa Lengies); neurotic waiter Calvin (Patrick Benedict); too many others. Guzman and McBride are the pros here, and they're fun to watch, but it's a mark of the movie's ineptitude that it puts the whip-smart B-movie queen Anna Faris ("Scary Movie") in a server's smock without giving her anything to do.
Mostly, everyone stands around talking about their naughty bits. As Monty explains to the dumbfounded Mitch, the male staffers have an ongoing contest in which they flash each other in baroque ways; if the other guy looks, he's "gay" and gets a kick in the pants. Yes, this reflects some seriously repressed sexual confusion on the part of the characters, filmmakers, and target audience. No, the script acknowledging as much with a few lame jokes doesn't help.
Will Dean take idiot boss Dan (David Koechner) up on his offer to join management? Will Calvin get over his urinary shyness? Will Monty learn that sleeping with underage girls is morally if not legally problematic? If only "Waiting. . ." made any of this interesting. Reynolds is the film's mascot and prime offender, still trotting out his "Van Wilder" bad-boy routine as if he were rebelling against anything that hadn't been settled long ago. He's an imitation Jason Lee, who's himself an imitation of Chevy Chase with the goofball parts left out.
In the end, the special of the day is chicken, since "Waiting. . ." doesn't dare shock its complacent college audience with anything more than hubba-hubba booty talk and close-ups of burning spliffs. Even Monty pulls back from the precipice in a scene that's both unbelievable and hypocritical. For a movie this obsessed with genitalia, where are the cojones?

         Working food service should be mandatory for all citizens, like jury duty or paying taxes. It teaches young people humility and demonstrates humanity at its worst, making most subsequent jobs seem easy by comparison. Staying at such jobs for too long, however, can lead to burnout, lack of self-worth and arrested adolescence.
 
  An insightful behind-the-scenes comedy could probably be made about a group of twentysomethings, at the beginning of their journey toward lives of quiet desperation, working at a generic, interstate-adjacent chain restaurant — say one that specializes in fajitas, overcooked chicken and baby-back ribs.
 


         






    "Waiting ..." is not that movie. Writer-director Rob McKittrick instead parlays his six-year career working as a waiter at such establishments throughout Florida into an uninspired ensemble sex comedy about the staff of the fictive ShenaniganZ, whose main diversion is "The Game," a competition in which a player attempts to surreptitiously induce co-workers into looking at his genitals. The successful player then ridicules his victims for being latent homosexuals and gives them a certain number of kicks in the rear based on the degree of difficulty of his subterfuge.
 
  McKittrick runs his cast — headlined by Ryan Reynolds and Anna Faris — through a predictable and overly familiar menu of food- and sex-related gags and gross-out jokes. Presumably, McKittrick based his characters on people he worked with, but in translating them to the screen he's stripped them of any detail that might have made them memorable. The characters in "Waiting ..." seem like composites, cobbled together from other movies and TV shows than from life.
 
  Justin Long plays Dean, the ostensible protagonist, who suddenly awakens to the fact that he's on the fast track to loserville when he's offered an assistant manager's position at the restaurant. Reynolds, Faris, Kaitlin Doubleday, Alanna Ubach and Robert Patrick Benedict round out the wait staff as they trade quips and put-downs while flashing each other over a relatively routine 24-hour period. Luis Guzman as a libidinous cook and Chi McBride as a philosopher-dishwasher are wasted in supporting roles.
 
  Little ingenuity goes into the many ways the staff defiles the food of rude customers, and none of it will shock anyone who's seen a hidden-camera exposé of restaurants on the local news.
 
  Even seven years ago, when McKittrick and his script began a gantlet of development purgatory and distributor buyouts, the ideas presented here — including hip-hop-obsessed white busboys — must have seemed tired.
 
  Considering the usual industry machinations, McKittrick is fortunate his vision made it to the screen intact, but this is one instance where some rewrites would have been justified. The filmmaker captures a certain exaggerated verisimilitude, but the comedy is surprisingly flat. The cast sells the occasional one-liner, but a Reynolds smirk can take you only so far.

 In general release   

The best joke in Waiting... , a moderately disgusting comedy about one gruesome day behind the scenes of a chain restaurant, might be that the place is called ShenaniganZ. That's a plausibly funny name for any fake strip-mall-orbiting eatery. It's also the height of the movie's wit. The rest of the laughs (when they eventually arrive; the first half hour is kinda bleak) are mostly scraped from the pit of your roiling stomach. In a scene rightly held up as representative by the movie's trailer, Blade: Trinity 's Ryan Reynolds (as the horndog leader of the bowling-shirt-and-apron'd staff) oversees the garnishing of an irksome customer's steak with dandruff, pubic hair, and loogie. Much time is also devoted to ''the penis-showing game.'' With its sweet stupidity and shoddy production values, Waiting...  knowingly evokes bad '80s R-rated comedies, but the differences are telling. Instead of naked boobs like in the old days, here we get gross, (hopefully) prosthetic male and female genitalia. Today, in other words, it's even more fake  and harder to watch.


The wait for laughs lasts the entire length of "Waiting ...," first feature from writer-director Rob McKittrick that aims to be a "Clerks"-type comedy set in a chain restaurant but ends up somewhere below a "Porky's" sequel. What talented B-list mainstream thesps like Ryan Reynolds and Anna Faris are doing in this C-grade timekiller is a mystery. Even more mysterious is pic's braving theatrical waters when it practically screams "rental." Hardtop career will be drive-through speedy, with ancillary likelier to cash in on project's appetizing-enough appearance. 
Plotless series of tepid gags is set during one afternoon-to-closing shift at Shenanigan'z Bar & Grill, a middlebrow eatery in the vein of Applebee's or Sizzler. This is the first day at work for high school-age trainee Mitch (John Francis Daley), whose nonplussed reactions are meant to underline just how wild 'n' wacky the staff here is.
Waitpersons are led by snarky, underage-womanizing Monty (Reynolds), his cynical onetime g.f. Serena (Faris), his nice-guy housemate Dean (Justin Long), latter's equally nice on/off g.f. Amy (Kaitlin Doubleday), foul-mouthed Naomi (Alanna Ubach), and neurotic Calvin (Patrick Benedict).
Their manager is older, dorky Dan (David Koechner), who wields his puny power with a heavy hand while desperately trying to be everyone's pal. Staff includes cranky horn dog cooks led by Raddimus (Luis Guzman), psychiatric wisdom-dispensing dishwasher Bishop (Chi McBride), hot lesbian bartender Tyla (Emmanuelle Chriqui), and very-nearly-legal Natascha (Vanessa Lengies), who teases every guy into a Lolita-jonesing lather.
Twenty-two-year-old Dean is offered an underwhelming "promotion" to assistant manager by Dan the same day he learns a former classmate has just gotten his degree in electrical engineering. Should he bail before what started out as an after-school job turns into a dead-end, life-sucking-dry "career"?
You can guess where that strand is headed, and there's precious little surprise -- let alone comic invention -- in the parade of obnoxious customers, bad tippers and employee revenge tactics (spitting in food, etc.) that consume remaining screentime.
Of course, how high can one's hopes be raised by a movie whose central running gag revolves around something called "the penis-showing game"? (Interestingly, eventual fleeting close-ups of both male and female private parts suggest the MPAA "R" smiles upon comedy genitalia, recoiling from equally brief but "serious" anatomical exposure, as in concurrent unrated "Where the Truth Lies.")
Puerile, inert and drab, "Waiting ..." makes "Car Wash" look like a classic ensemble workplace comedy by comparison.
Allowing for possibility that feature may have been sitting around for a while (it sports a 2004 copyright), it still surprises that Reynolds had nothing better to do than more-or-less reprise his "Van Wilder" character here. Apart from one outburst in which she cuts him down to size, Faris is entirely wasted. She does, however, get two lines that nail the film's most loutish tendencies: Calling the boys' behavior "an exercise in retarded homophobic futility," and cracking "If you guys go five minutes without referencing your genitals, I'll be amazed."
Rest of the cast would be funny if they had anything to be funny about. Even the wigger riffing of perfectly cast Max Kasch and Andy Milonakis -- as teen busboys who annoy all with their stoned wannabe-gangsta posturing -- is just mildly amusing because the script does nothing to freshen up a done-to-death satirical target.
Shot in New Orleans -- though the city isn't mentioned or its locations made the least use of -- package is mediocre in every department. Queries as to its original shooting format (at times image looks vid-shot) went unanswered.

A day in the life at chain restaurant Shenanigan's, Waiting . . . makes a predictable pit stop to elaborately mess with a creep patron's food but otherwise exceeds expectations by handling the real, soul-sucking fears of the double shift. What survives in a greenhouse of marathon desperation? Besides the waitersRyan Reynolds  trying to quip away humiliation and bang the underage hostess, his desirably sluttish ex, the nice girl who gets screwed on tips, the bug-eyed chain-smoking careerist, the earnest up-and-comer-there's the power-struck manager and the obscene head chef (a role eaten up by Luis Guzmán ). Chef saved the flagging restaurant years ago by inventing the sanity-saving Game: An employee stealthily exposes his cock and/or balls in contortions like the Goat or Batwing, hoping to catch a male co-worker looking, whom he then gets to kick in the ass. It's a great bit, but to director Rob McKittrick 's credit, the funniest scene is also the saddest: The kitchen crew, having cleaned up, watching the clock like New Year's, goes nuts when a couple is seated a minute before closing. This is pain.
