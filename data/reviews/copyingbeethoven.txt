Early in "Copying Beethoven," when the great composer is about to enter a room, one intimidated character can't take it. "Beethoven's coming!" You could say the same about the man playing Ludwig van Beethoven: "It's Ed Harris. Duck!"
Built like an old college wrestler, Harris saunters through this toasty little piece of biographical fiction in love with the part's fixins'. Every lock of the character's fantastic gray hair seems to move at Harris's will (in that sense, Beethoven's the Beyoncé of the 19th century). And the composer's deafness is an occasion to shout the darnedest things ("I have to pee, my dear"). This is indeed 1824 Vienna, but when a man's got to go. . . . And from an acting standpoint, go Harris does, without shame and, on one occasion, without clothes.
Directed by the estimable Agnieszka Holland, the film tells the invented story of Beethoven's final year and his relationship with Anna Holz (Diane Kruger) , a willful music student hired to help him finish copying the "Ninth Symphony." The woman didn't exist, but neither, presumably, did much of the dialogue. Take Beethoven's reaction to some of Anna's own compositions: "You've invented a new genre -- 'Fartissimo.' "
After Anna starts editing the maestro's music, we know "Copying Beethoven" is all about taking liberties. Besides, the film is too busy equating religious fervor with musical genius to bother nailing down every historical detail.
Holland is no stranger to informal period dramas, having tackled the Holocaust in "Europa Europa," Rimbaud and Verlaine in "Total Eclipse," and Henry James in "Washington Square." She's also familiar with the ways of Ed Harris, having guided him to one of his best performances as a priest suffering a spiritual breakdown in "The Third Miracle." And most of her work contains a related philosophical strain.
Indeed, "Copying Beethoven" is the sort of movie where no one talks about politics, sports, or the weather. Everyone thinks and speaks in platitudes and positions. The film itself is concerned with higher principles of artistic achievement: Yes, it's good, but would God like it? The modest inspiration in Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson's script is its suggestion that there's a little of God in everyone. OK, there's a lot in Beethoven: "God whispers into some men's ears," exclaims the maestro. "He shouts into mine!" Anna has the tact not to remind him that his hearing, after all, is impaired.
For a while, it seems these two will never really get to know each other. But the performance sequence of Beethoven's Ninth bonds them. Within the intimate space of the symphony hall, the film's drained look turns into something radiant. Anna talks some confidence into her nervous boss, and in one tracking shot he blossoms from insecure to cocky. Anna cues him, the piece begins, and, on the conductor's stand, the virile actor and the virtuoso composer thrillingly converge.
It's an exuberant passage. Harris maniacally sways to every note. Since we know Beethoven can't hear well, the rapture on Harris's face suggests he's seized with something divine (God's shouts) -- although, at times, it looks like he's having a heart attack and a hot flash simultaneously with his eyes shut tight, then bulged, nostrils flared, his mouth hanging open, his wig gone wild.
As Anna guides Beethoven, Harris's body moves fluidly in time with Kruger's. This is the only scene in the whole picture that really speaks to Holland. She exalts the music, and the music exalts her filmmaking. The director and her editor, Alex Mackie , even throw in shots of the excited choir, including one of a singer so eager to sing this piece that she almost jumps the gun. (She knows it's that good.) The camera spins and quakes, and when the sequence is over, the movie should be, too. But it continues long enough for what preceded it to seem like foreplay and for what follows to feel like anticlimax.


         "He mooned me," Anna Holtz (Diane Kruger) confesses to her persnickety engineer boyfriend, Martin Bauer (Matthew Goode), relating another day at the office with her new boss, Ludwig van Beethoven. This disclosure would be disconcerting enough if Beethoven's death didn't predate the expression (or at least its current usage) by about 140 years. But according to press notes for Agnieszka Holland's "Copying Beethoven," the soulful amanuensis and self-appointed emotional advisor to the great composer is a "fictional character based on actual persons." So she's as free to be as anachronistic as she wants to be.
 
 Certainly Holland ("Europa, Europa," "Olivier, Olivier"), who directed from a script by Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson ("Ali," "Nixon") seems intent on bringing a 1980s women's studies department sensibility to this 19th century tale of tortured artistry and eleventh-hour sensitivity training. And for all its awe at the composer's mad genius and black hole-like ability to suck the oxygen from a room, the movie belongs to Anna, a girl with a dream in the days before girls were allowed to have them.
 


         






   The movie is intended as an account of the great composer's final years, when deafness took his music in radical new directions not immediately understood by his audiences. Profoundly lonely and angry about the cruelty of his condition, Beethoven spent his last few years alone and isolated. According to the film's producer-screenwriters, "the great challenge in dramatizing the last years of Beethoven's life is that he really had no one to talk to." Enter the young, beautiful, worshipful and talented, but not too 
talented, Anna. She has come to Vienna to study composition at a conservatory and enters Beethoven's life by way of his publisher Wenzel Schlemmer (Ralph Riach), who has asked the conservatory to send along its brightest student to work as a copyist. In what can only be interpreted as some kind of era-related snafu, the conservatory sends a girl. The poor, abused Schlemmer, whose cancer has at least spared him the agony of having to deal with the talent much longer, dispatches Anna straight into the maw.
 
 When Anna meets Ludwig (Ed Harris), hearing loss has reduced him to wearing a cone-like contraption strapped to his Graydon Carter wig. He's an intimidating figure, all sturm und drang und
 ego, but Anna, all of 23, has his number. Presenting him with her first musical transcription, she explains that she's taken the liberty of correcting a couple of things in advance. She knows he would have changed them eventually, because she "understands his soul." Naturally, she secretly hopes that he'll soon understand hers when she gets up the nerve to show him her work. In the meantime, she's made to suffer remarks like, "A woman's composing is like a dog walking on its hind legs. It is not done well, but you're surprised to find it done at all."
 
 The real Beethoven never said any such thing, of course. But a couple of other people did. Samuel Johnson concocted the quip in honor of female preachers, then Virginia Woolf adapted it to describe the prejudices faced by women artists in "A Room of One's Own." In fact, Holland's copyist recalls the book's hypothetical Shakespeare's sister — only where Woolf imagined a woman prevented from writing by the circumstances of her gender and eventually killing herself, "Copying Beethoven" imagines a girl whose adorably po-faced perseverance wins her the respect and admiration of her hero, who eventually inspires her to dump her fancy prig in order to pursue her dream.
 
 Fine. But hasn't Ludwig suffered enough? Why drag him into this? It's not just that the movie plays fast and loose with his biography, inserting a nonexistent soul mate into his last, lonely days — though this is a new trend, apparently, as evidenced by the new, imaginary biopic of Diane Arbus, "Fur," in which the unhappy photographer discovers fleeting happiness with a made-up sideshow refugee (Robert Downey Jr. in a Chewbacca costume) — it reduces Beethoven to a moldy cliché. Harris reprises shades of Jackson Pollock to create a method Ludwig, for whom the creative process is an extended physical effusion. Like a 17th century Russell Crowe, he lumbers, bellows, smashes offensive bad art with a single smack of his cane. He teases the barwench, torments the neighbors and hideously oppresses his nephew Karl (Joe Anderson), a pink-eyed weasel with a gambling problem, whom he claims to adore.
 
 Maybe because the relationship makes very little sense, the characters seem as though they were put there to reflect the other's feelings. For Anna, Beethoven is a screen on which to project her fantasies. For Ludwig, Anna is a handy ear in which to funnel his loneliness and rage. His reactions are so explosive, in fact, they require rack-zoom reaction shots from Anna, who nonetheless stoically suffers her disappointment in her hero's social skills and soldiers through the work. When the doorknob-deaf Beethoven (though his hearing impairment appears to be rather mercurial and selective) insists to Schlemmer's horror on conducting the symphony himself, Anna steps in as ghost conductor. Together, they bring the piece to an ecstatic chorale climax, at which point an earthquake seems to hit the concert hall.
 
 Shot by Ashley Rowe to look like a cross between a Vermeer retrospective and a music video, "Copying Beethoven" is silly and misguided, if reasonably entertaining for its charming lack of self-awareness, its weakness for lines like "Loneliness is my religion!" and its transcendently beautiful music.

O lucky dead-white-genius babe magnets! Painter Johannes Vermeer got Scarlett Johansson as his fictional assistant in Girl With a Pearl Earring , and now in Copying Beethoven , Ludwig van Beethoven (Ed Harris) gets Diane Kruger as the pretty girl who writes out the cranky musical giant's manuscripts and lauds his Ode to Joy. Agnieszka Holland's empurpled bio-fantasy is hooey with an anachronistic feminist slant from start to finish, lacking the jaunty cinematic dementia of Immortal Beloved . As LvB, Harris is intense, and intensely bewigged.

 In the movies, the life of the mind often turns to mush and stories about genius tend to be painfully dumb. Film seems to have such a firm hold on exterior reality that the inner world of creation is simply too mysterious and elusive for commercial stories that depend on objects and actions, too obscure for a medium that depends on light. And so most filmmakers give us painters slashing away at canvases with grim determination and writers nibbling on pens that might as well be magic wands, pantomimes of inspiration spiked with the usual flavorings of perversion, despair, alienation and tragedy.  At first glance the period film “Copying Beethoven” looks as if it might be following a familiar course. To begin with, there is Ed Harris in a Beethoven wig. It’s a fine wig, but wigs are generally worrisome, particularly when atop a head that seems quintessentially modern American. Then there is the matter of the young German actress Diane Kruger, who had the misfortune to play Helen in Wolfgang Petersen’s “Troy” and looks too beautiful to play a role of any substance. That, at least, is one lesson imparted by Hollywood, where, as around the 12th century B.C.,  attractive women are often little more than prizes to be passed around onscreen. Happily, the film director Agnieszka Holland, whose previous features include “Europa, Europa,”  is herself a woman of substance.  “Copying Beethoven” takes place in 1824, toward the end of Beethoven’s life.  Ms. Kruger plays Anna Holtz, a Viennese music student who through talent, ambition and happenstance finds herself summoned to transcribe Beethoven’s messy musical notations. Stone deaf, Beethoven initially rebuffs her services (you’re a woman, he all but shouts, as if her sex were a crime), but quickly relents. Time and life are running out, and he is too preoccupied with finishing his latest symphony to rout out someone new. So together, in a darkly lighted apartment where rats scuttle underfoot amid eggshells and overflowing chamber pots, he composes and she copies. In time, the work and the notes join forces until one evening, with Beethoven conducting, the Ninth Symphony erupts into a dazzled world.  The presentation of the Ninth is reason alone to see the film. Onscreen is the Kecskemet Symphony Orchestra of Hungary,  but what we hear is a 1996 Decca recording of Bernard Haitink conducting the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. Purists may object to this strategy, but Ms. Holland’s filmmaking in this scene is so sensitive that only quibblers will notice if the bowing doesn’t match the sound. With her cinematographer, Ashley Rowe, and editor, Alex Mackie, she orchestrates bursts of images and metronomic camera pans that become a visual counterpoint to the music’s propulsive and flowing tempos, its rushing violins and soaring voices. Every so often the camera focuses on one of Beethoven’s hands, the  fingertips stirring the air as if rustling the notes. The world falls away, blissfully.  The screenwriter Stephen J. Rivele, who wrote “Copying Beethoven” with Christopher Wilkinson (their other credits include “Nixon” and “Ali”), has explained that the idea for the film originated with Anthony Hopkins, who subsequently opted not to take the role. Mr. Harris, an actor who can show the storms gathering under a character’s skin, proves an ideal substitute. Topped with  that messy salt-and-pepper wig that frames and obscures his scowling, searching face, he invests Beethoven with a violent turbulence that sometimes floods the room but mostly stays coiled inside, where it seethes. (Even his darkened eyebrows look furious.) This isn’t the narcissistic rage of movie-made genius, but the private agonies of a man who lives very much alone in his head.  “Copying Beethoven” doesn’t shed light on those torments, partly because the screenwriters keep a respectful distance from their subject and partly because Ms. Holland is too smart and unsentimental to fall into such a storybook trap. Beethoven’s nephew Karl (Joe Anderson) expresses revulsion at his uncle’s affection for him. But, happily, no one delivers a speech about the psychological undergirding of a relationship that would, finally, be known only to these long-dead men. When Beethoven talks about Karl, Mr. Harris releases his scowl as if unclenching a fist; you don’t need to hear the composer describe his love and pain, you see them. Ms. Kruger, alas, must explain more, largely because of her gender, which needs both contextual explanation and, apparently, a love interest.  According to Mr. Rivele, the  character of Anna Holtz, though based on two of Beethoven’s male copyists, was created in part because the intimation of a love story helped finance the production. That seems plausible. Certainly a film about an irritable male genius and his male assistants might not be as entrancing as the image of Ms. Kruger scrubbing a floor on her hands and knees, skirt pushed up to reveal a sliver of luminous skin. This isn’t a criticism: Ms. Kruger looks exceedingly fetching whether on the floor or hunched over a desk. More to the point, her attractiveness is not irrelevant in a film with such an unembarrassed feeling for beauty, be it in a woman’s face or a rapturous ode to joy.  “Copying Beethoven” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The rats may disturb some viewers.
Ed Harris  as Beethoven ? A strange casting choice, especially if you recall how Gary Oldman  embodied the maestro in Immortal Beloved . But as Jackson Pollock , Harris did bring to life a tormented artist. Give the man a large metal ear trumpet, fright wig, and piano, and maybe it's not such crazy casting after all.
Like Immortal Beloved , Copying Beethoven  refrains from making the great composer its actual protagonist, viewing him instead through the eyes of someone close to him. Here, our guide through Ludwig's world is Anna (Diane Kruger , previously the Helen of Wolfgang Peterson 's Troy ), whom we first see rushing to Beethoven's deathbed, the world outside her carriage a series of quick cuts perfectly timed to the symphony in her head.
Anna, a student at the Vienna  music conservatory, works as a copyist for Beethoven, who turns out to be like every obnoxious self-absorbed creative type you've ever met: an egomaniac.
Director Agnieszka Holland  (Europa, Europa ) doesn't drape the story in finery. This Vienna is rainy, dirty, rat-infested, and full of piss pots. Beethoven throws his possessions all about the place, firing his maids and relishing in rodents because, he says, they scare away the cats. This filth makes for a grand contrast when Beethoven finally debuts the Ninth Symphony in an opulent concert hall, insisting on conducting even though he can't hear the orchestra. This is the film's climax, and a spectacular one even if you're not much of a classical-music fan. Beethoven was, after all, the rock star of his time.
Unfortunately, this climax occurs in the middle of the film, and nothing much happens afterwarda major structural misstep. Instead of sending us out on the concert's high, screenwriters Stephen J. Rivele  and Christopher Wilkinson , best known for the two ponderous biopics Ali and Nixon , deliver a film awkwardly composed.
