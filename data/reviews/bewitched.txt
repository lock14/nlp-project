This isn�t Nicole Kidman�s first dalliance with witchcraft, and it is one of Bewitched
�s unfortunate achievements that it actually makes one pine for Kidman�s 1998 dud, Practical Magic
. That witch at least had some sass; this cardigan-clad witch, alas, is an altogether more benign being, and by "benign" I mean boring. The so-very-meta premise goes as such: A closeted witch named Isabel (Kidman) is cast in a TV remake of the classic Sixties show starring Elizabeth Montgomery. Playing her TV husband, Darren, is Jack Wyatt (Ferrell), a washed-up movie star trying to make a comeback. Isabel, meanwhile, is trying to go straight (and the movie gets some laughs out of Isabel�s frequent falls off the no-witchcraft wagon); she takes the acting gig primarily because she likes the look of Jack and likes the idea of falling in love the old-fashioned way. The repurposing of classic television shows for feature film fodder is by now a rather stale business � a fact the script (by Ephron, her sister, Delia, and frequent Ferrell collaborator Adam McKay) references in a tongue-in-cheek joke. In fact, it�s rather on the nose: Bewitched
 feigns like it�s doing something inventive but it�s really rather reductive, in both its only-when-convenient nostalgia for the original show and its borrowing of elements from other Ephron pictures (You�ve Got Mail, Sleepless in Seattle)
. Wisecracking secondary characters are usually the filmmaker�s strong suit, but she overcompensates here with an excess of mostly unmemorable bit players. (Caine, as Isabel�s warlock father, is the one bright spot.) The lead characters are just as thinly sketched, as is their attraction. God only knows why Isabel settles on Jack, a preening prat; just as unlikely is everyone�s astonishment at Jack�s movie-star megalomania (the film is set in Hollywood � antics like Jack�s are a dime a dozen in that town). Ferrell, in need of a shorter leash, never makes the character any more than a caricature, and Kidman, in a rare comedic role, suffers, too. Her Isabel is, I suppose, an innocent, but that mistranslates into dimness (she doesn�t know what a "dick" is, which makes one wonder if chastity pledges are issued to witches along with their broomsticks). There�s a certain floofiness
 to Isabel, a trait common to Ephron�s woman-child characters. It�s a sort of a sexless ditziness that is meant to be endearing (and in Ephron�s most frequent leading lady, Meg Ryan, often is). But Kidman is too sharp an actress for so much cuddliness. If this misfire doesn�t convince her to hang up the pointy hat, then might I suggest a remake of Bell, Book, and Candle
? Kim Novak�s cool seductress is exactly
 the kind of witchy woman Kidman was born to play.


Even by the lowest, loosest standards of silliness, "Bewitched" is a juvenile movie, made for people who watch their romantic comedies while wearing a bib.
Nicole Kidman plays a witch named Isabel who's grown tired of casting spells and wants instead to live among mortals. Randomly, she is cast in a television update of the old "Bewitched" television show, where her job is to be the set-up gal for the program's actual star, Jack Wyatt, a washed-up buffoon of an actor played by Will Ferrell.
Jack has hired this unknown, virginal beauty partially because she can wag her nose just as Elizabeth Montgomery did on the original show but mostly because her anonymity and naivet� will make him look good. She doesn't know to be offended that the writers give her no lines.
Eventually, Isabel figures it all out and retaliates by putting a hex on Jack, but she winds up removing it (because, as she keeps telling us, she's through with being a witch). Instead, she tells Jack off and the two fall in a shallow puddle of love.
Whose idea was this?
The credits insist that its writer and director is the usually perceptive Nora Ephron, author of "When Harry Met Sally" and the darling "Sleepless in Seattle." But such rudimentary storytelling and moviemaking is on display here that you might mistake the movie for a Children's Television Workshop production, brought to you by the letters h-u-h.
"Bewitched" is conceptually trapped. It panders to fans of the show: An underused Shirley MacLaine looks just like a drag queen doing Agnes Moorehead; Steve Carell makes a fool of himself doing Paul Lynde's prissy Uncle Arthur. That tinkle-tinkle-tink of Samantha's nose wiggle has a bigger role than either of them.
But the movie also wants to be sophisticated, like a project-within-a-project that Charlie Kaufman, the writer of "Adaptation," might dream up. The Lynde character is not someone on the movie's TV show; he's an adviser who shows up in Jack's off-camera life. Unlike Kaufman's films, there's no wit, structure, imagination, or guiding idea here.
Instead "Bewitched" presents a phony and cynical look at how Hollywood might make or remake a television show. It's as grating, laughless, and narcissistic (though, to its credit, not as cruel) as that new Lisa Kudrow show-within-a-show-within-a-show, "The Comeback."
A comeback is what Ephron is aiming for, five years after the Kudrow-John Travolta bomb "Lucky Numbers." But "Bewitched" is damp with flop sweat: Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell in love? It makes as much sense as mustard on a doughnut. That they're actually not a disaster together is an extremely lucky accident.
At moments, Ephron and her sister and co-screenwriter, Delia, seem to offer a critique of the entertainment industry and the people in it. But the filmmakers can't decide on a target.
"Being a witch," Jack says to Isabel, "is like being an actor. You snap your fingers and anything you want materializes." The movie doesn't have nearly enough fun with that analogy.
When the Ephrons do agree on something to send up, it's too easy. MacLaine's character works her magic on Isabel's randy dad (a weary-looking Michael Caine) by turning all the bimbos he meets into . . . bimbos. When "Bewitched" stops trying to be smart, it pleads for our sympathy, asking us to feel for Isabel's wish to become a real girl. It's a request that would be far easier to embrace were she pursuing her dream in, say, Omaha and not Los Angeles.
That said, Kidman is a pleasure to watch in a part that's quite unlike her others. Her voice is simultaneously whiny with wonder and nothing but air, like Tina Louise on "Gilligan's Island." The star is breezy but stuck, like a sheet being whipped around on a clothesline. Kristin Chenoweth, the helium-voiced sprite who was Glinda the Good Witch in Broadway's "Wicked," plays Isabel's bubbly blond neighbor, and she shows Kidman how to enjoy herself while stealing all their scenes.
As fun as Kidman is, there's no getting past the fact that the character is a prim dingbat. After casting a spell to land the perfect bungalow, she makes childlike discoveries ("Hey, I'm turning on the sprinklers in my front lawn!") and sets bizarre personal goals, which sound like a desire to live on the set of a TV show: "I want to go to the Coffee Bean and talk about the day's events."
That crass cross-promotional reference may not mean much to folks who live east of Burbank, but Ephron has placed other products you're sure to recognize. Isabel doesn't know what a penis is, but she's well aware of Visa, Diet Coke, Volkswagen, and Bed, Bath & Beyond.
This is the galling irony of Ephron's movies: She insists on a sexual chastity between her characters while whoring her movies to one lusty corporation after another. (After all, she named "You've Got Mail" after the AOL catchphrase.) Should this movie doom Ephron's directing career, perhaps she could find work as a pimp.


         "Bewitched," which was directed by Nora Ephron and co-written with her sister, Delia, isn't a remake, really. It's a "reimagining," which is a sparkly word for what happens to a beloved TV hit of yesteryear when it's cannibalized by committee.
 
  The movie, which spent more than a decade in development, stars Will Ferrell as Jack Wyatt, a fading movie star who takes a job playing Darrin on a TV remake of the original show; and Nicole Kidman as Isabel Bigelow, the unknown, Valley-dwelling nonactress Jack hires to play Samantha. The twist: Isabel is a real-life witch on the hunt for a needy male mortal, which, frankly, beggars credulity. Who's going to buy Nicole Kidman as an unknown nonactress living in the Valley?
 


         






    Maybe the biggest surprise about "Bewitched" is that it's not as terrible as the buzz that preceded it. Glossy, hard-edged and studded with clever lines, it sort of clubbed me into submission from the outset. The Ephrons mock their cake and eat it too, making fun of Hollywood's remake obsession by making a movie about a TV remake. And they skewer the Hollywood feudal system with a savagery that made my stomach hurt.
 
  Ultimately, "Bewitched" is more interested in flattering your inside-entertainment cynicism than indulging your fond nostalgia for Elizabeth Montgomery. Though in trying to do both, it winks, nods and nudges so relentlessly that at times the movie seems on the verge of a grand mal seizure. Instead, it goes quietly nuts, folding fictional elements from the show into the part of the movie that's supposed to be real (which is as confusing as it sounds) and congealing into a singularly uninvolving romance.
 
  The movie begins with Isabel flying over freeway interchanges, strip malls and a patchwork of emerald lawns and sapphire pools and finally alighting in front of a charming Spanish bungalow that she promptly appropriates and decorates through a series of minor spells. Once settled, she meets her bouncy neighbor Maria (Kristin Chenoweth) and tries to dodge her disapproving dad, Nigel (Michael Caine, who steals every scene he's in).
 
  Nigel seems to pop up whenever Isabel goes shopping — here he is in the signs at Bed, Bath & Beyond, there he is on the packaged food labels in the supermarket: Look, he's the jolly Green Giant! — to nag her about her decision to quit whatever parallel netherworld witches are supposed to inhabit. Why he's so bent out of shape about it is unclear. It's not like Isabel has gone and married a neurotic middle manager who won't let her use her powers. It's not even like she decided to switch majors from econ to women's studies. All she's done is move into a shabby chic paradise and hook herself up with free cable.
 
  Beyond that, Isabel has no idea what she's going to do with her life until Jack spots her, or rather spots her nose, through the self-help shelves at a local bookstore. Isabel refuses the job at first, especially after Jack describes celebrity as something very akin to witchcraft. ("You snap your fingers and get whatever you want!") But his "troubled, unkempt" quality wins her over, and in less than a week, as she tells Nigel, Isabel is transformed into "a rich and famous actress living in a house I don't have to pay for, just like any other normal person."
 
  (You have to appreciate a Nora Ephron joke at the general expense of Nora Ephron-inspired movie romantic fantasies in which housing and career miracles of this magnitude don't even involve magic.)
 
  A monstrous, unchecked celebrity id given to fits and tantrums and sudden demands for a leopard. Jack's only reason for wanting to cast Isabel is that she is too unfamiliar with Hollywood culture — or with culture at all — to realize she's being used. Egged on by his weaselly agent, Richie (Jason Schwartzman), Jack sweet-talks her into taking the part, then cuts all her lines; and the show's creators (reimagineers?), played by a barely used Stephen Colbert and Jim Turner, are powerless to stop him. Jack's despotic, moronic celebrity trumps all reason.
 
  Eventually, Isabel gets wise to Jack's true nature (she has a crush on him at first, then tosses her vow not to cast spells and starts hexing him relentlessly). What takes her so long — her powers don't seem to include powers of perception — is part of the problem with the movie. Kidman gives Isabel a Marilyn Monroe whisper and a kitten-with-a-whip demeanor that's light years behind Samantha's sassy, resourceful and modern (for the times) suburban mom. The little-girl act is needed to justify her crush on Jack, whom Ferrell plays like a 5-year-old throwing a tantrum in a supermarket.
 
  Things get really weird when Shirley MacLaine's Iris, the actress hired to play Endora on the fictional TV remake, also turns out to be a real witch (albeit one from a realm other than Isabel and Nigel's — they don't know her). It's a rather pointless part, but MacLaine makes the best of it, flirting with Nigel and keeping his interest by causing younger women to blurt out their most unappealing qualities. Isabel is paid a visit by Aunt Clara (Carole Shelley), and Uncle Arthur (Steve Carrell, channeling Paul Lynde) pops in on Jack.
 
  In "reimagining" Samantha from a married housewife witch into a single slacker witch, all that was interesting about the series has been lost. Whether it intended to or not, the TV series satirized pre-feminist roles. Samantha attempting to dampen her superhuman powers so as not to threaten or upstage her dorky, neurotic, helpless husband — that was funny. Plus, Darrin's advertising job depended on his ability to maintain a veneer of corporate, suburban conformity, so the situation at home was universally familiar and entertainingly explosive. In other words, the show, no matter how fantastical, was about something real. The movie is about Hollywood.

The question before us today at the Being and Nothingness School of TV Properties Cannibalized by Hollywood is why Bewitched  is so not. The answer is because it has been made by industry Muggles who have doused irony and satire over something that owes its original, delicate  charms to the exact opposite of irony  to utter sincerity in the face of preposterousness.
The 1960s-’70s  sitcom, a beloved series from the Formica age when wifies still fretted about getting ring-around-the-collar stains out of their hubbies’ shirts, starred Elizabeth Montgomery as a real witch named Samantha who married a mortal, and who used her sorcery for suburban good to keep her man in line. All she had to do was wriggle her nose and magic (as well as laugh-track comedy) would follow. The contempo production, directed by Nora Ephron from a script she co-wrote with her sister, Delia Ephron, stars Nicole Kidman as Isabel Bigelow, a real witch who gets cast in a remake of the TV show opposite Will Ferrell’s Jack Wyatt, a dim actor trying to salvage a tanking movie career. Urged on by his smarmy agent (Jason Schwartzman), Jack takes the small-screen deal as a chance to  improve his Q-rating by becoming a lovable, funny TV star, and in his zeal to hog the spotlight, he insists on casting an unknown in the role of Samantha.
Isabel, who is trying to swear off witchery and has moved to Los Angeles hoping to lead a “normal,” spell-free life (pause for snicker cue: in L.A.?), lands the job when Jack spots her in a bookstore, indulging in some spontaneous nose-wriggling while reading a self-help book. She accepts the offer (much to the chagrin of her warlock father, played  come to think of it, what avuncular role isn’t these days?  by Michael Caine) because she is attracted to what she perceives as Jack’s charming flesh-and-blood masculine neediness. And then he turns out to be uncharmingly self-centered. (Ferrell seems unsure himself about where to put his energies, settling for some unstable region  between his two specialities of vain dolt and giant boy.) Witches in Isabel’s part of the world clearly do not watch the tube or she would have already known about loutish male behavior from the TV prophet Dr. Phil.
The premise is indeed clever. It also turns out to be too clever by half, warping the movie so that it’s neither a sweet repetition of the original notion (man and witch play house) nor an insider-oriented parody of showbiz neuroticism. Kidman plays Isabel with a breathy voice, an amalgam of Marilyn Monroe and Jennifer Tilly, and she’s the best thing in the picture by far: The same ethereal/androidal tendencies that can make her seem, at times, as bubble-wrapped as fellow sorceress Glinda-the-good-witch give her a shimmer of sincerity that is missing from everyone else involved.
Shirley MacLaine, in the part of the actress playing Samantha’s mother, turns the woman into an applause hog. Steve Carrell, as Paul Lynde as Uncle Arthur, becomes his own Steve Carrell special. The Ephron sisters, sophisticates entrusted with a simple TV situation comedy, lose the magic of the com as they mess with the sit.

 Once upon a television time, when witches, genies and homemaker vampires ruled the roost, the war of the sexes was as cute as the button nose on Elizabeth Montgomery's face. As the star of the dimwitted delight "Bewitched," Ms. Montgomery wiggled her protuberance at a husband whose bumbling ways turned a topical power struggle into the stuff of canned laughter.  For some, 1964 is fondly remembered as the year President Lyndon B. Johnson signed a civil rights act, barring sex discrimination in the workplace, as well as the year Ms. Montgomery materialized as the gauzily sexy witch Samantha.  "Bewitched" is now a big-screen movie with Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell and a nicely tuned supporting cast. Because the ethereally beautiful Ms. Kidman no longer resembles a real person, having been buffed to almost supernatural perfection in the way of most modern stars, casting her as a witch was inspired.  Equally clever is the film's core conceit, which finds her playing Isabel Bigelow, a reluctant witch who is  cast as Samantha in a remake of the original sitcom. Anxious to leave behind the world of spells and (especially, it seems) warlocks, Isabel yearns for the simple life, much as Eddie Albert did when he moved next door to a pig on "Green Acres." Instead, the witch becomes a star.  This multisituational silliness is agreeably watchable for an hour. Isabel, having made a vow to go on the witchcraft wagon, settles into a dream of a house complete with a white picket fence, a garlanded lawn and a tortoise-shell cat. Much like other cultural aliens, both extraterrestrial and those fresh off the boat, sweet Isabel is charmingly overwhelmed by her new world.  She relishes the idea of shopping like a mere mortal but doesn't give any thought to how to pay for her groceries. And when she tries to hook up the cable, she (understandably) turns on the charms. It's no wonder that her father, Nigel (Michael Caine), casts a skeptical eye at his daughter; he seems to know that relinquishing your power is no easy thing.  These early scenes unfold smoothly, and it appears that the director, Nora Ephron, who wrote the screenplay with her sister, Delia Ephron, gave some thought to what it might be like to be a witch who suddenly has to live in the human world.  It's pleasant just to watch Ms. Kidman float through the movie's sets like a visitor from another land; she's as adorable as E.T., though her voice is as baby-breathy as that of Marilyn Monroe. Ms. Kidman has of late become perhaps overly fond of speaking in such undertones (it makes you wonder if she permanently strained her vocal cords), but here the kittenish delivery adds a crucial softness, a sense of comfort, that doesn't come naturally to this actress.  During the first years of "Bewitched," Ms. Montgomery was one of the era's stealth vixens, a woman whose alert eyes darted under the cover of unthreatening blondeness. Unlike Lucy Ricardo, from whose canyon mouth flowed a river of complaint (and whose restlessness always felt somehow tragic), Samantha really did seem like the girl next door who was happy to become the model wife.  The great joke of "Bewitched" was that unlike Lucy, Samantha had enormous power but kept it in check to placate her husband, unless it served her purposes. It's a sign of the times - and perhaps of the fact that women wrote, directed and produced this film - that Samantha's surrendering her power in a marriage no longer seems as believable as her becoming a celebrity.  The story, such as it is, kicks in when the movie star Jack Wyatt (a relatively unplugged Will Ferrell) tries to kick-start a faltering career by starring in a television redo of "Bewitched." Because he's playing Darrin, the witch's genially hapless husband, Jack angles for an unknown as Samantha, the better to hog all the limelight.  He ends up with Ms. Kidman's Isabel ostensibly because not a single woman in Los Angeles's vast reservoir of acting talent can wiggle her nose like Elizabeth Montgomery. Yet Isabel is also cute, easily improvises with Jack about witch dos and don'ts (you need a permit for a poisoned apple and so forth) and looks mighty fine on camera, which temporarily works against her when she tests better than Jack with the audience.  Ms. Kidman and Mr. Ferrell are not an intuitive match, and the romantic side of the story is both half-hearted and half-baked. But this self-contained actress has rarely come across as relaxed in the company of another performer.  For his part, Mr. Ferrell enjoys a few ticklishly funny moments with Ms. Kidman and Jason Schwartzman, playing his sycophant manager. And the sight (and sounds) of his biking onto the set while loudly singing his own name has comic tang, as does a more developed scene in which Jack pretends he's insufferably pampered. Mr. Ferrell looks more streamlined than he has in the past, perhaps in concession to the story's low-wattage romance, but Nora Ephron's attempts to turn him into Tom Hanks Lite are unfortunate.  Best known for screenplays like "When Harry Met Sally" and for bowdlerizing Lubitsch's "Shop Around the Corner" with her execrable "You've Got Mail," Ms. Ephron is one of those directors whose work is only as good as her cast and crew. Outside of the performers there isn't much to look at here, but given the cavalcade of supporting characters there are some distractions, including Shirley MacLaine, Heather Burns and Stephen Colbert. Along with the two stars, they keep the film in gear until it hits the hour mark, whereupon it dies. (Steve Carell, doing Paul Lynde doing Uncle Arthur, provides some late relief.)  The film's screenwriters conjured up a very clever gimmick when they decided to revamp a favorite 60's television show. Too bad they forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie.  "Bewitched" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film is pretty tame, though as is his onscreen wont, Mr. Ferrell does go partly bare for one scene.

Nora Ephron's attempt to reconceive the standard TV-to-bigscreen adaptation goes bizarrely haywire here, spinning out of control like a runaway broomstick. Burdened by its show-within-a-movie-about-a-show structure, "Bewitched" suffers from its sheer peculiarity as well as a lack of chemistry (or alchemy, for that matter) between leads Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell. Despite the occasional grudging moment of strange magic thanks to Ferrell's antics and the large, talented but wholly squandered supporting cast, whatever initial box office curiosity exists should give way to DVD banishment once word-of-mouth casts its spell.
Although the idea of finding a fresh way to tackle such material is admirable, what finally emerges is a film that has about three different movies in it -- "Splash"-type fish out of water? Hollywood romance? Down-on-his-luck actor gets magical career help? -- and that's unable to settle on any of them.
Isabel (Kidman) is a real-life witch who yearns to be a normal person, though she hasn't quite mastered not employing magic to tidy up. Setting up house in Hollywood, her womanizing warlock dad (Michael Caine, always welcome, though put to much better use in "Batman Begins") warns that she'll miss her powers.
Soon, however, Isabel stumbles into Jack (Ferrell), a neurotic movie star coming off a major flop and in the midst of a nasty marital breakup -- problems that are forcing him to consider slumming in television. ("Bewitched" won't have the same effect on Ferrell, but it's hard to resist pointing out that two or three more misfires of this scale might.)
Jack's squirrelly agent (Jason Schwartzman) brings him a sitcom remake of "Bewitched," but to avoid the Darrin syndrome -- that is, being so much the second banana that they could change actors practically without notice -- he insists on selecting an unknown as Samantha. Enter Isabel, who can do that nose-crinkling thing Elizabeth Montgomery made famous, and, in her new-to-town naivete, takes the job mostly because she has a crush on Jack.
Actually being a witch, it turns out, means not having to think much when you're asked to improvise. Alas, though, the producers' decision to highlight Jack means that he freely steps all over Isabel's lines, which she eventually discovers, throwing a monkey wrench in their budding off-set romance. And despite all that, she still ends up testing higher with focus groups.
As written by director Ephron and her sister Delia, pic exhibits a fondness for the original series but doesn't click as a romance -- in part because the miscast Ferrell's character is such a self-absorbed boor it's hard to fathom what Isabel sees in him. Even the narrative timeline gets confusing, as the series is said to be taping a second episode after it seems (or at least feels) like it's been on the air for months.
In terms of Kidman, her latest nose-centric role won't make anyone forget "The Hours." Playing Isabel as a wide-eyed waif, in fact, makes her mostly uninteresting, with more of a spark coming from Kristin Chenoweth (a more beguiling witch herself in "Wicked") as her feisty neighbor.
Then again, there are lots of potentially funny people with not much to do, including "The Daily Show's" Stephen Colbert and Steve Carell, and Shirley MacLaine as the hammy actress playing Samantha's mom. Yet whatever charm Ephron brought to "Sleepless in Seattle," the magic's gone here, lost amid a pace that not-so-magically causes time to slow down in the second act.
"Bewitched" does attempt to make use of trappings from the series, including its jaunty theme crooned by Steve Lawrence. There's even one particularly intriguing act of magic, as Isabel causes time to rewind so she can erase the unforeseen consequences of a wayward spell.
Watching the movie run backward, though, only spurs reflection on whether it should have kept unspooling in reverse a little further -- all the way back to the development stage.

I have no idea why Hollywood  makes movies derived from TV series that the all-important 15- to 25-year-old ticket-buying demographic has absolutely no firsthand knowledge of, or why those same designated audiences do in fact pay to see them with formidable reliability. But I can tell you this about the new Bewitched  : It is an affliction. As if the work of an angry god, the movie collects the perspectives of Nora Ephron  (director, co-writer), Delia Ephron  (co-writer), and Penny Marshall  (producer), coalescing into a showbiz self-suck unrivaled in modern times for smugness, vapidity, and condescension. To spend even 10 minutes in the movie's universe is to experience the Sartrean nausea of an utterly hollow head and heart.
The original show, lovable and aggressively innocent though it was (I preferred I Dream of Jeannie  , if only for Larry Hagman 's manic anxiety), is far too hokey to be considered "high concept," and at any rate had trouble attracting a daytime rerun viewership by 1976. Our new heroine is a chipmunk-falsettoed, apricot-cheeked Nicole Kidman , who's so sheeny with digital airbrushing she's got the unearthly vibrance of a newborn. This new Samantha (Isabel, actually) longs to give up witchery and live like a normal person in Beverly Hills  (!), but before long she meets up with descending megastar Will Ferrell , who's making a new Bewitched  TV series! So she falls for him and  gets cast as Samantha, even though she's actually a witch! Isn't that a fucking riot?! As always a fool for wealth porn, Ephron also jams her scenes with swatches and memorabilia from the old showpostmod!and virtually every sequence change is an occasion for a song interlude. "Witchy Woman," "Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead," Sinatra on "Witchcraft," the Police's "Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic." I'm dying!
It's symptomatic of the recycling-regurgitating Hollywood dynamic that the TV show within the movie doesn't resemble anything a real network would make todayfor all of their navel-gazing insider-ness, Ephron, Ephron, and Marshall are as clueless as farm turkeys. Kidman cutes it up, and Ferrell is so fearless in the face of the tasks put before him that he should get a Nobel, but it's nothing they couldn't do while brushing their teeth, or more to the point, paying their bills. The film is airy and weightless, not like, say, chiffon, but like the black smoke of burning truck tires. In an ideal world, Marshall and the Ephrons should have to sharecrop, for all the good they've done for the culture.
