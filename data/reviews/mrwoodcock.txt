Thornton is fast becoming the master of what can only be termed �deadpan malignancy.� What other actor working can communicate as much disdain, as much disrespect, as much malicious indifference without even a word? Others can convince you of murderous intent, but no one else can give you a look that says, �If I had my way, you�d all be shoveling my shit for a living because that�s all you�re good for.� And it�s a good thing, too, because he�s coming to rely on that look more and more as his career goes on. Mr. Woodcock
 is the third in Thornton�s unofficial �exhausted-contempt� series � after Bad Santa
 and Bad News Bears
 � in which he plays a character whose complete indifference to the rules of etiquette and the feelings of other people leads him to acts of comic violence against the least among us: the young, the old, the infirm, Woodcock
 co-star Scott. Thornton plays the title character, a gym teacher in small-town Nebraska legendary among students for his bullying tactics and total lack of sympathy for the awkwardness of youth. The movie begins 13 years ago, with Woodcock badgering a group of early-adolescent boys into learning the rules of basketball, the primary one being, apparently, that strength is the only rule that matters. (�Lose the asthma,� he commands one wheezing boy before sending him off to run laps.) One of his unfortunate charges is John Farley (Scott), who commits the cardinal gym-class sins of being overweight and unable to do a pull-up. Flash forward 13 years, and John is now a famous writer of self-help books about letting go of your past and moving on with your life. Of course John hasn�t let go of anything; behind that gleaming smile and muscular body, he�s still a fat kid in his underpants, hanging for his life from a chin-up bar. Which is made painfully clear when he returns home to Nebraska to find out that his mother (Sarandon) is engaged to Woodcock and that he�s the only one who�s clear-eyed enough to stop the relationship and expose Woodcock for the abusive cuss that he is. Unfortunately, Mr. Woodcock
 is funny for exactly five minutes, during which time Woodcock is shown throwing basketballs at boys� heads and mocking them for having dead parents. It�s that kind of subversive, did-he-really-just-say-that humor that helped turn Thornton into the unforgivably awful SOB you can�t help but love and that exposes the rest of Mr. Woodcock
 � with its focus on Scott�s self-pity and paper-thin frat humor � for the half-hearted retread that it is.


You don't need to aim high when you name a movie "Mr. Woodcock." On the other hand, if you're the people behind this latest throwaway Billy Bob Thornton comedy, you should at least aim low enough.
Written by newcomers Michael Carnes and Josh Gilbert, the film logs almost all of its laughs when it's at its crudest, meanest, and most unfiltered. Everything else - and that is to say most of the movie - is a big, fat, derivative waste of time.
Thornton plays this title character with the same swagger from last year's weak "School for Scoundrels" remake. This time, he's a crass, hard-nosed middle-school gym teacher with a deeply disturbed view of character building. One of his favorite targets is a butterball named John Farley, who grows up to be a famous self-help author/guru played by Seann William Scott (Stifler in the "American Pie" movies). Farley preaches letting go of the past, a mantra that's tested when he returns home to Nebraska to find his mother (Susan Sarandon) in a serious relationship with the infamous Mr. Woodcock.
A "Meet the Parents"-style war ensues, with mind games, athletic contests, and tedious tests of will to determine who's more macho. Farley enlists the help of a simple-minded childhood friend (Ethan Suplee wandering over pretty much in character from the set of "My Name Is Earl"), but he'd be better off harnessing the fire of his ruthless publicist (Amy Poehler) to dispense with this the way she waves off an airline stewardess ("Could I get a real bottle, please? I'm an alcoholic, not a Barbie doll").
This movie needs more of that nasty bite, which is what seems to be promised in the unsettlingly amusing opening scenes of Woodcock terrorizing his students. There's nothing new in Thornton's tactics, but he's at least more interesting than Scott's constipated angry young man. And almost anything would be better than watching these two cartoons jabbing their way toward an ending too silly even for a movie that casts Sarandon as a Corn Cob Queen.
Formal credit for directing "Mr. Woodcock" goes to first-time filmmaker Craig Gillespie, whose upcoming "Lars and the Real Girl" is slated to screen tomorrow as part of the Boston Film Festival. However, it's been reported that the original version of "Woodcock" tested so poorly, director David Dobkin ("Wedding Crashers") was brought in to do several weeks of reshooting. The finished product feels like the unloved child of a bad marriage where the only thing anyone remembers is the sharp edges.


         That Americans worship their children only makes Billy Bob Thornton more deliciously, subversively funny as a tormenter of the young. He made them suffer in "The Bad News Bears," abused them in "Bad Santa" and is back in business as the nightmarish gym teacher of "Mr. Woodcock," a movie that commits sins of excess, except regarding Thornton. There's not nearly enough of him.
 
 There is an abundance, however, of Seann William Scott as John Farley, the bestselling author of "Letting Go," a book about losing your past, who has become the idol of stretch-pants-wearing doughnut assassins across the country. He's also, as we see via amusing flashbacks, a former student of Woodcock, whose favorite lines were "Take a lap," "Lose the asthma" and, as regards Farley, "You're a disgrace to fat, gelatinous little kids the world over."
 


         






   That John should return home to find his mother (Susan Sarandon) dating Woodcock becomes a trauma of biblical, professional and Freudian proportions.
 
 Director Craig Gillespie keeps things moving at a brisk clip as John makes an ass of himself, abandoning his book tour to come home to Forest Meadow, Neb., and receive the key to the city. Once there, he not only discovers Woodcock nuzzling his mother but being honored too, with everything from the Educator of the Year Award to a Woodcock Pizza at the local parlor. "What's next?" asks fellow Woodcock-hater Nedderman (Ethan Suplee). "The Hitler Calzone?"
 
 John doesn't let go of his past. He embraces it, to sometimes comic but more often humiliating effect. Amy Poehler is perfectly, perhaps inevitably, cast as John's vodka-guzzling book publicist, who berates him from afar for missing his "Oprah" opportunity.
 
 This is one of those movies that hasn't anywhere to go once it's set up its premise, save toward greater embarrassment for all concerned, although we do get a glimpse into Woodcock's past: Bill Macy appears as Woodcock's poisonously belligerent father, who makes his son seem like the Dalai Lama.
 
 Perhaps a prequel? "Mr. Woodcock II" could get into the roots of Woodcockian misery. It would be hilarious.
 
 "Mr. Woodcock." MPAA rating: PG-13 for crude and sexual content, thematic material, language and a mild drug reference. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. In general release.   

A few years ago, a comedy like Mr. Woodcock   in which a self-help author (Seann William Scott) tries to help his mom (Susan Sarandon) realize that her new fiancé (Billy Bob Thornton), the wicked gym teacher of the title, is the scum of the earth  would've played fine. Uninspired, sure, but sporadically, spasmodically funny. But in this post-Apatow-the-arrested-development-genius world, it can't compete. The only thing worth watching is Sarandon, popping in from a classier reality.

 In “Mr. Woodcock,” a self-help author named John Farley (Seann William Scott) returns to his Nebraska hometown and learns that his long-widowed mother, Beverly (Susan Sarandon), is dating the title character, a coach who made John’s life hell.  Woodcock, played with icy panache by Billy Bob Thornton, is a smirking bully who turns gym class into boot camp, flaunts his intimacy with John’s mom and talks in hard-boiled aphorisms. (“I’m already past my past. That’s why I call it my past.”) Horrified, John tries to break up the affair, leading to wacky misunderstandings and much hugging and learning.  Between Mr. Thornton’s wry performance and Tami Reiker’s nuanced wide-screen photography, you half-expect “Woodcock” to deliver more than formulaic laughs. When John meets Woodcock’s dad (Bill Macy) — a hateful coot who barks “Water sports is for girls and sodomites!” — the film threatens to show that Woodcock is not just an emblem of the jock bully mentality, but also one of its damaged products.  But such an approach would complicate John’s hatred of Woodcock, and the film’s screenwriters, Michael Carnes and Josh Gilbert, and its director, Craig Gillespie, won’t have it. They instead endorse the idea that Woodcock’s abuse made John a better, stronger person. It’s “The Great Santini” remade as a sitcom.  “Mr. Woodcock” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for crude and sexual content, thematic material, language and a mild drug reference.  MR.

There's more genuine humor to be gleaned from saying "Woodcock" over and over again than from watching "Mr. Woodcock," a wan comic effort barely elevated a few notches by Billy Bob Thornton's passive-aggressive villainy as the titular gym teacher from hell who becomes a young man's potential stepdad from hell. Initially slated for 2006 but delayed by behind-the-scenes wrangling and extensive reshoots, the New Line release should attract some mainstream biz with its name cast before weak word of mouth sends it to the ancillary showers.
Having exorcised his childhood demons by writing a popular self-help tome, former fat kid John Farley (Seann William Scott) returns home to find his mother, Beverly (Susan Sarandon), dating the source of those demons -- namely, Mr. Woodcock (Thornton), the monstrous P.E. teacher whose classes amounted to government-sanctioned child abuse.
When his attempts to make nice are met with withering indifference from mom's new fiance, John goes on the offensive, tossing aside his own lessons about "letting go" of the past. Haunted by flashbacks of his younger self (Kyley Baldridge) being humiliated and physically pummeled by Mr. Woodcock, John tries to undermine his nemesis at every turn -- only to end up getting humiliated and physically pummeled anew.
On paper, it's a bracingly direct and fertile comic premise, with a twisted sub-Oedipal kick: Almost every joke is predicated on John's fury and revulsion at the thought of his mom sleeping with the enemy (whose impressive virility is commented on by more than one bystander).
And the film does have a not-so-secret weapon in Thornton, whose contemptuous drawl is the perfect vessel for Woodcock's casual misanthropy ("Lots of losers out there, I guess," he says matter-of-factly when he hears John's book is a bestseller). Thesp even makes his no-bull caveman act attractive enough to halfway sell the idea of Beverly falling for such an irredeemable lout.
But Thornton's nicely underplayed malevolence is the only consistent factor in a comedy that plays its central antagonistic relationship for easy laughs, but lacks the guts to follow it to its nasty, logical conclusion. Instead, script resorts to obvious red herrings and the sort of pat uplift you'd expect from ... well, a bestselling self-help book.
From its lengthy gestation and production woes (although Craig Gillespie retains directing credit, producer David Dobkin was brought in for reshoots) to its inane and misleading ad campaign (resorting to the same suggestive testicular imagery used by ads for the recent "Balls of Fury" and 1998's "BASEketball"), everything about "Mr. Woodcock" suggests a muddled project with no clear idea what kind of movie it wants to be.
Amy Poehler adds some mildly amusing but wholly irreverent bitchery as John's high-functioning alcoholic agent, while Melissa Leo delivers a succulent five-minute turn as Woodcock's randy ex that makes the viewer want to follow her into another movie. Both actresses are better served than Melissa Sagemiller as John's blah romantic interest.
Tech credits are solid, the standout being some excellent stuntwork during the pic's numerous physical pratfalls.

Bad Santa gets worse every time he trots out the same mean routine; does anyone at this late date recall a movie starring Billy Bob Thornton  in which he doesnt yell at retarded fucking kids and bark at their stupid parents? After coaching the Bad News Bears  to ruin and flunking out of the half-witted School for Scoundrels , Thorntons forcing kids to take a lap while pelting them with basketballs in Mr. Woodcock  Among Mr. Woodcocks poor pupils is a chunky lad who grows into a self-help guru (Seann William Scott ) that looks a lot like Stifler from American Pie , and returns home in best-selling triumph only to discover his mom (Susan Sarandon , poor gal) has shacked up with Woodcock. And in a single instant, the self-help guru is self-helpless in the same house as his childhood tormentor, with whom he wars till the final few scenes in which alls well that ends welland if you think thats a spoiler, youve clearly never been to a movie. Amy Poehler  ekes out a smirk or two as a boozy broad publicist trying to keep her paycheck in check, but even the best gags feel like leftovers, again . In other words, Woodcock s a strictly flaccid family affair. Bet you saw that coming too.
