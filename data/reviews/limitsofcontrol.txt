 The walking man in “The Limits of Control,” a Minimalist exercise in the key of cool from Jim Jarmusch, wears through a lot of shoe leather during his feature-length tramp. One of cinema’s men with no names, credited only as the Lone Man, this peripatetic figure is played (and walked and walked) by Isaach De Bankolé with a determined gait and inscrutable gaze that initially reveal almost as little as the elliptical storytelling. Like Mr. Jarmusch, the Lone Man doesn’t share his intentions until he reaches the end. By that point, though, if you’ve paid attention to the cues and opening credits, you will be steps ahead of both.  Set more or less in the present, the Lone Man’s journey gets going in an airport where he receives some vaguely philosophical directives from a suave number played by the French actor Alex Descas and credited as Creole. Mr. Descas’s low-key intensity imbues the setup with a shiver of menace — despite the unhurried pace, it feels as if something heavy were at stake — an air of unease that’s counterbalanced by the dryly amusing fashion in which the Creole’s sidekick (Jean-François Stévenin) translates the orders. The Creole speaks in, yes, Creole (his words are translated in the English subtitles) and the sidekick repeats them (sometimes with slight modification) in English, which means the instructions are given three times. Repetition, it emerges, is the film’s central structuring device.  That much at least becomes quickly apparent after the Lone Man leaves the airport. Wearing a form-fitting, lightly iridescent blue suit and purple shirt, he travels to Madrid, where he settles into a 1960s high-rise apartment building with a cylindrical facade that brings to mind rolled coins. There he stays for an indeterminate amount of time. Days slip into night, though it’s unclear if they’re slipping in sequence or during different weeks and months. Whatever the case, the Lone Man establishes a routine that deviates only in its details: he sits at a cafe, drinks two espressos and, at some point (hours, minutes, days later), is joined by a man or woman with whom he exchanges almost identical matchboxes. Sometimes, he visits a museum.  A sensitive colorist, Mr. Jarmusch is given a rich palette here by Christopher Doyle — the bright Spanish light does its part — the cinematographer known for his work with Wong Kar-wai. (Mr. Doyle makes color pop and vibrate, but he also knows how to light for black skin.) Although the Lone Man doesn’t say much, the images of him suggest plenty, whether he’s looking through a red-tinted window or standing against a red wall in an elevator. These splashes of color, which appear to signal some unspoken threat or warning, serve as pieces of a puzzle that Mr. Jarmusch assembles with formal rigor and languid pacing that increasingly borders on the somnolent. Other pieces: a guitar, a flamenco song and Bill Murray.  It’s too bad that Mr. Murray’s name appears in the opening credits, since his absence from most of the film hints what will happen in the unfortunately obvious climax. By the time Mr. Murray appears, the Lone Man has racked up a lot of miles and traveled to other places where he’s exchanged matchboxes with mysterious types who ask him — just as the Creole did earlier — “You don’t speak Spanish, do you?” The line is funny the first, second and almost the third time. Along the way are a quotation from Arthur Rimbaud and several nods at Jean-Luc Godard, including a shot that frames Paz de la Huerta’s apple-cheeked derriére much the same way that the French filmmaker did Brigitte Bardot’s in “Contempt.”  “The Limits of Control” is a veritable Bartlett’s: the Lone Man’s stoicism and sartorial flair evoke the solitary figures from Jean-Pierre Melville’s films. Tilda Swinton, one of the matchbox girls, name-drops Hitchcock. Mr. Jarmusch’s production company for this film is PointBlank,  a reference to the 1967 John Boorman crime movie with Lee Marvin, and he has borrowed the title of “The Limits of Control” from a 1975 essay by William S. Burroughs, in which the writer analyzes a favorite topic: systems of control. Some of the lines in Mr. Jarmusch’s spare screenplay (“Everything is subjective,” “Reality is arbitrary”) also echo Mr. Burroughs, notably “Nothing is true, everything is permitted,” which the writer attributed to the 11th-century Islamic leader Hassan-i Sabbah and from which the word assassin derives.  There’s more, including the reductive if sincere denouement inside a bunker with a representative of evil (no, not Hitler) that brings the Lone Man’s walkabout to an anticlimactic close. It’s a lousy letdown, at once naïve and too freighted with real-life meaning for a film that — as its thick accretion of pop-cultural and literary quotations indicates — leans so heavily on outside sources for substance and depth. Philip Glass has said that repetitive music “must be listened to as a pure sound-event, an act without any dramatic structure.”  At least for its first hour, before its repetition strategy turns tedious, the same could be said of “The Limits of Control,” a nondramatic work best appreciated as a pure image-and-sound event.  “The Limits of Control” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Violence, some crude language and Ms. de la Huerta in various states of undress.

There are limits to artistic self-indulgence, limits to how long a filmmaker can keep spinning his creative wheels before his work approaches self-parody, and limits to the tolerance of even a devoted specialized audience for artistic vacuity, and they are all well exceeded by "The Limits of Control." This discerningly photographed travelogue of modern Spain features Jim Jarmusch in shallow poetaster mode, grafting familiar quasi-philosophical doodles and trendy cameos onto a woolly hitman's journey. The limit on the theatrical potential for this Focus Features release is extreme.
Drinking lots of espresso (emphatically two single shots in two separate cups) and impassively refusing to show any emotion (except once, when a waiter dares serve him a double in one cup) while making his way across Spain by plane, train and automobile, French/African thesp Isaach De Bankole makes for the most verbally inexpressive leading man since Wall-E, in his fourth appearance for Jarmusch. Blessed with boldly structured facial features that at least hold one's attention longer than would those of most people, De Bankole scarcely says a thing as he receives a series of enigmatic instructions from a succession of contacts -- "Go to the cafe ... wait two days ... the guitar will find you," this sort of thing -- and only springs to life while doing tai chi routines.
Pointedly ignoring the arguably overexposed Barcelona in favor of Madrid, Sevilla and other locations, Jarmusch would seem to have devoted more time to selecting -- and then, with ace lenser Christopher Doyle, deciding how to shoot -- the film's striking architectural settings than he has to layering his story with depth or meaning. Structurally, given the long trek to an unknown destination, "Limits" most readily calls to mind the estimable "Dead Man" among Jarmusch's films. But there are no cultural, spiritual or historical reverberations on this trip, only hollow echoes of such tough-minded genre classics as "Le Samourai" and "Point Blank" (after which this film's production company was named), as well as the director's own decade-old hitman tale, "Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai."
To be sure, the surfaces are alluring; Doyle and Jarmusch approach the many beautiful buildings and locations with graceful, often curving camera moves that specifically suit the physical nature of their subjects, and steer clear of pretty postcard shots. But with the exception of the unavoidably provocative all-nude, all-the-time performance of voluptuous Paz de la Huerta as a sex bomb who sleeps with the protag but can't get a rise out of him, the brief supporting turns, by the likes of Tilda Swinton, Gael Garcia Bernal, John Hurt and Bill Murray, come off like insider gags that verge on the silly.
Worst of all, it just feels tired and recycled -- the referencing of Rimbaud and Blake, the flagrant hipsterism that here falsifies rather than refreshes, the self-conscious plunking down of all manner of foreign actors in unlikely contexts, the above-it-all attitude toward connecting on a human level. And then there's the music, mostly by a Japanese electronic noise outfit called Boris, that drones on ultimately to congeal into a state of undead rigor mortis.

Jim Jarmusch  is a model of stylistic consistency who emerged as a full-blown talent and erupts once a decadeStranger Than Paradise  in the 80s, Dead Man  in the 90s, The Limits of Control  today.
An acutely self-aware, anti-psychological character study, The Limits of Control focuses on the archetype of the Hitman. Jarmusch sets his self-contained, catalytic anti-hero (French-Ivorian actor Isaach De Bankolé ) in a semi-documentary landscape and contemplates his progress with a quasi-religious sense of awe.
Identified in the credits as the Lone Man, Jarmuschs protagonist exists only in terms of his unspecified mission, or his role in what is perhaps a conspiracy. The Lone Man is introduced in an overhead shot doing tai chi in an airport toilet stall, then taking a meeting in the first-class lounge. A few inexplicable aphorisms later, hes traveling through Spain by train, grooving on a landscape shot by Christopher Doyle  and soundwashed in hyperdrone acid jazz (courtesy of the band Boris). Like everything Jarmusch, The Limits of Control  is calibrated for cool.
The Lone Man is a creature of habit, defined by his idiosyncrasies (insisting on two espressos in separate cups) and his reserved response to his invariably eccentric contacts. All this killer need do is show up and acknowledge the password ("You dont speak Spanish, right?") to receive a coded message passed in matchbox and set off his contacts solo riff. De Bankolés voluble co-stars include Tilda Swinton  (a refugee from Wong Kar-wai s Hong Kong in blonde wig and matching Stetson), John Hurt  (babbling about Bohemia, bohemians, and "an oddly beautiful Finnish film"), Gael García Bernal  (in manic mode), and Bill Murray  (identified as "The American" and channeling Donald Rumsfeld ).
Madrid  and next-stop Seville  are filled with obvious spies. Its borderline risible when the Lone Man finds a naked girl with a gun (Paz de la Huerta ) lolling on his hotel room bed or when Swinton begins holding forth on the nature of old movies: "Sometimes, I like it in films when people just sit there, not saying anything," she adds by way of acknowledging De Bankolés silence. Thats Jarmuschian humor. His movies are typically based on a series of whimsical two-handers: In The Limits of Control , these meet-cutes have been boiled down to a set of absurd, enigmatic repetitions. Led to a "closed" flamenco bar, the Lone Man watches a rehearsal in which the singer delivers dialogue from the movies first scene with such excessive stylization that it inspires the flicker of a smile on his normally inexpressive face.
By the time the Lone Man is given an ancient guitar, from which he removes a single string, and, told that "the Mexican will find youhe has the driver," travels to a forsaken town in the middle of nowhere, he might be wandering through the afterlife. The landscape goes through cosmic changes en route to a pueblo that looks like it was last inhabited by the cast of a spaghetti Western. But even as he ventures deeper off the map in a truck with the bumper sticker "La vida no vale nada " ("Life is worthless"), theres no missing the Lone Mans uncanny wardrobea succession of stylish suits with color-coordinated shirts that could hardly fit in his elegant, ridiculously small travel bag.
The Limits of Control  is a shaggy dog story, but its leaner and less precious (and more beautiful) than the past few Jarmusch filmsnot to mention his last exercise in existential assassinitis, the 1999 Forest Whittaker  vehicle Ghost Dog . The Lone Man traverses the empty streets and barren landscapes of an abstract thriller, glimpsing previously met characters (or their images), engaging in mysterious transactions (a fistful of diamonds here, an earful of Schubert there), and trafficking in the free-floating symbols of a surrealist poem. His steps are guided by picture postcards or red flowers found lying in some stone-paved alley. Tracked by (or following) the same black helicopter from city to city, chased by kids who ask if hes an American gangster, he lives in a world of allegory and myth.
Mission accomplished, the Lone Man ponders an Arte Povera  white canvas and rope assemblage in Madrids Reina Sofía  museum. What does it mean? The contents of the package are unknowable; the twine that wraps around its enigma is everything.
