If you can buy the fact that Canadian horror auteur David Cronenberg and composer Howard Shore recently unveiled a full-fledged operatic version of their 1986 film, The Fly
 � in Paris, no less � then chances are you'll be able to figure out this very peculiar, very 3-D, but not very exciting or even all that humorous animated offering from Belgian-born director Stassen. It is, on the face of it, a simple little parable of spirited can-do-ism, in which a trio of young houseflies (voiced by Gagnon, Bolden, and Gore) semiaccidentally tags along with astronauts Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin as Apollo 11 slips the reach of gravity (but not, surprisingly, Raid) and shoots moonward. Lurking beneath that main story, though, is a number of subplots only slightly less fancifully trippy, including a pair of bumbling Soviet house-spies sent to Cape Canaveral to sabotage the mission, an elderly fly (Lloyd) and his unrequited love for his long-lost Soviet paramour, and a downright bizarre recurring gag/theme about how bad it is to be overweight. Strange as it is, Fly Me to the Moon
 boasts superb 3-D effects (debuting feature director Stassen made his name making lots of 3-D nature and entertainment shorts) and gobs of colorful animation, but anyone over the age of 8 is likely to be bored into madness by the lightweight puns that pass for real humor � WALL-E
 this ain't � and the film's overall "eh" quotient. Adding to the weirdness is a tacked-on, live-action appearance from the real Aldrin, who reassures kids and terrified X-Files
 fans that there weren't, in fact, any houseflies on board Apollo 11, and therefore any concerns about a giant, gamma-irradiated Jeff Goldblum-type are not to be entertained. Or something to that effect.


"Fly Me to the Moon" is a computer-animated kiddie flick about three housefly best friends who buzz their way onto the Apollo 11 mission to the moon. That sounds as genuinely painful as an August dog-days release can be, and it would be, except for two things. One, if you're 6 years old, you probably never realized how insanely cool the 1969 moon landing was in all its rocket-geek details. Two, what the filmmakers do with 3-D here is within shouting distance of art.
The director, Ben Stassen, has been making 3-D and IMAX
 shorts for a decade or so, and somewhere along the line he, like us, got tired of jabbing audiences in the eyeballs with yo-yos and tape measures. Instead, "Fly Me to the Moon" uses 3-D technology for something far more satisfying: creating a sense of enchanting, ever-shifting visual depth.
You notice it right off: At the screening I attended, the first shot of a swampy pond extending off into the distant mist (cattails in the foreground) drew gasps of astonishment from not only the children but their parents. Nothing had happened yet, but the setting seemed charged, hyperreal.
Throughout the film, the Belgium-based 3-D house nWave works against our expectations: Instead of a limited number of animated planes of depth, "Fly Me to the Moon" evokes infinite gradations. Instead of launching objects out at us, the film sends characters flying in over our heads from the back of the theater, eliciting dismayed cries and swatting motions. For the first time in my experience, a 3-D movie felt bigger than my ability to take it all in.
The story line, unfortunately, is miniscule. "A Bug's Life" gone retro-rocket, "Moon" is set at Cape Canaveral in 1969 and follows three young boy flies - heroic Nat (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), brainiac IQ (Philip Bolden), and fat, lazy slob Scooter (David Gore) - as they scheme to sneak aboard the Apollo 11 launch. Trying to hold them back is Nat's mom (Kelly Ripa); cheering them on is his retired-aviator Grandpa (Christopher Lloyd) and adorable little maggot siblings.
(That's right: maggots. They're pink and wriggly and have big grins and "cute" eyes, none of which keeps them from being thoroughly revolting. Between these guys, last year's "Ratatouille," and the cockroach sidekick in "WALL-E," vermin are the current must-have family movie accessory. Leeches, call your agents. Wait, that's redundant.)
The character design is fairly creepy - Grandpa looks like a mummified skeleton - and the dialogue as inane as you'd expect from second-tier kiddie product. The humans are awkward and Lego-like; the villainous Communist Russian flies just dumb. The hardware, though - the hardware is perfect. From the Saturn V rocket that lifts the mission into space to the Eagle Lunar Module landing in the Sea of Tranquility, "Fly Me to the Moon" introduces a new generation to mankind's most expansive adventure (complete with an enjoyably corny live-action cameo from astronaut Buzz Aldrin at the end).
And because the story is constantly shifting from bug-level micro to the vast macro of the solar system (with human-size NASA drama in between), the movie's 3-D visuals actually have a narrative function instead of serving as vaudeville jiggery-pokery. Watching "Fly Me to the Moon," you're forced to constantly renegotiate perspective and scale, and not only is this a distinct pleasure in the manner of an M.C. Escher drawing or Istvan Banyai's "Zoom" picture books for children, but it dovetails with the movie's greater scheme.
The Apollo 11 mission forced us all to think of ourselves as both a little bit bigger and quite a bit smaller than we were used to. "Fly Me to the Moon" is a crummy movie for kids, yet it still holds out the prospect of past wonders and future marvels. It's one small step for a housefly, one giant leap for 3-D.

The 3-D animation work in Fly Me to The Moon  is brisk and sweet, even if the script veers toward fussy and lame in this tot-level retelling of the historic 1969 Apollo 11  moon mission. The focus isn't on the human astronauts and their giant leap for mankind, but on three fictional, boy-like houseflies who, in the name of adventure, hitched a ride in the spacecraft. It's a kick to see actual moonwalker Buzz Aldrin at the end, but must he really assure kids that the spacecraft was, in fact, free of contaminants?  Oh, phooey on pedants.

 Parents wishing to stupefy their youngest children for an hour and a half might consider plopping them in front of “Fly Me to the Moon”  —  but only if a fourth viewing of “Wall-E” or a second trip to “Space Chimps” or a really bright flashlight shining in their eyes is completely out of the question.  “Fly Me to the Moon” bills itself as the first animated feature created expressly for 3-D. As these things go, this one goes well enough: the 3-D effects are sophisticated and incorporated into the overall design of the picture rather than trumpeted by random, poke-in-the-eye flourishes, although the movie does have an annoying habit of sneezing and burping in your face.  Still, too bad it wasn’t created expressly for, you know, pleasure or art.  Written by Domonic Paris and directed by Ben Stassen, the film involves a threesome of Florida houseflies stowing away on Apollo 11. One of the most undermotivated plots in many a moon, the zero-wit, zero-gravity misadventures of Nat (the voice of Trevor Gagnon), I.Q. (Philip Daniel Bolden) and Scooter (David Gore) are embarked on merely because they’re bored on their garbage dump.

Parents can rest easy: For those tots convinced by �Fly Me to the Moon� that three talking houseflies stowed away on Apollo 11 and saved the moon mission from certain disaster, Buzz Aldrin himself appears at the end of this 3-D animated adventure to straighten them out. It�s a bizarre moment in a film whose sense of humor is more antique than its 1969 setting. Timing might otherwise be golden, though, as the off-the-wall adventure/comedy is poised to fill the kid-fare vacuum between �Wall-E� and �Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa.�
Otherwise, it�s a wingless exercise, despite a rather heartening attitude toward space travel that will introduce young auds to the glory that was NASA in the �60s. Setting things up via mock-dated, black-and-white animated newsclips, pic shows the use of chimps in space (lots of �Space Chimps� around recently) and the progress of the Mercury-Apollo programs that led to the planned moonwalk in the summer of �69. Aldrin, Michael Collins and even Neil Armstrong are represented here in animated form, and it�s as close to the reclusive Armstrong as anyone�s likely to get.
Buoyed by period music � Canned Heat, �Groovin� � and, of course, �Fly Me to the Moon� � the wholly digitalized feature about three high-flying pests begins with Nat (voiced by Trevor Gagnon), who�s grown up listening to his Grandpa�s (Christopher Lloyd) stories about saving Amelia Earhart during her pioneering solo transatlantic flight in 1932. 
Given that the life expectancy of a housefly is less than two months, crusty Grandpa is something of a pioneer himself. But his stories stir his grandson�s imagination, and Nat enlists buddies IQ (Philip Daniel Bolden) and Scooter (David Gore) to come along and take a space ride. They are accompanied at one point by Strauss� �Blue Danube� (a piece the young flies might have heard a year earlier, had they been Kubrick fans).
�Dreamers get swatted,� Nat�s mother (Kelly Ripa) warns her son � although Grandpa�s always been one, and look how long he�s lasted. Grandpa gets a blast from his well-traveled romantic past when Nadia (Nicollette Sheridan) shows up from Russia to let them know the Soviet Space Program, Fly Division, is upset that the U.S. has beaten them in getting their insect life to the moon. And the Russians have sent the nefarious Yegor (Tim Curry) to sabotage the U.S. moon mission. Had �Fly Me to the Moon� been a bit more �Rocky and Bullwinkle,�  all this would still have made no sense at all, but it would have been a lot funnier.
Pic is a sort-of history lesson, a sort of comedy, a PSA for childhood obesity (Scooter is dangerously fixated on food) and a 3-D toon that seems more artificial than realistic. When the requisite objects pop off the screen, they don�t do so in a way that expands the ordinary 2-D constraints, but rather in a way that reminds you of those constraints in the first place � which seems contrary to what a 3-D film is meant to do.
And for all its computerized ambitions, �Fly Me to the Moon� is a curiously retro project. The animated characters are stiff and limited, and seem reminiscent of such relatively primitive �60s cartoons as �Crusader Rabbit,� albeit with the dubious advantage of being three-dimensional.
Production values are adequate. Because pic was fully rendered via computer, no cinematographer or editor is credited. 


The 3D adventure Fly Me to the Moon  imagines an alternate history in which three adolescent houseflies stow away aboard Apollo 11 , unintentionally thwarting the underdramatized space ambitions of a thuggish conglomerate of Russian flies. Alluding to but never showing us the eyes on the back of its characters' heads, and with Christopher Lloyd 's grandpa appearing as if he were modeled after Willem Dafoe  instead of Jeff Goldblum  (or—you know—an actual  housefly!), this sketchily conceived and executed space yarn is one missed opportunity after another. As the 3D genre necessitates, whole patches of the film hinge on pointy objects popping off the screen and threatening ocular protrusion, but aside from Neil Armstrong  landing on the lunar surface and awestruck fly-boy Scooter (David Gore ) witnessing the totemic event from inside the man's helmet, there's nothing inventive about the film's perspective of the world and the space above our heads. The be-all-that-you-can-be message is sweet, as is the way its main characters are written as secret saviors of the Apollo 11  mission, but the characterizations and details are derivative, with Scooter and his buddies I.Q. (Philip Bolden ) and Nat (Trevor Gagnon ) more than suggesting Alvin and the Chipmunks . These flies are meant to be one of a kind but they're just pop-culture magpies.
