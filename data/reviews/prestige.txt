Now you don't see them, now you do. On the heels of ``The Illusionist," the season's surprise hit, comes a second tale of period legerdemain. Ironically, doubles are at the heart of ``The Prestige," which sets two magicians at each other ' s throats in a decade-long battle for supremacy. It's like ``The Illusionist" crossed with a really hard Sudoku.
Fun? Yes, even when the machinery of betrayal and counter-betrayal gets overly busy. Based on the 1995 novel by Christopher Priest, ``The Prestige" has been directed and co-written by Christopher Nolan, and it's very much the work of the man who gave us 2000's ``Memento." There are flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks here, and not all of them tell the truth.
The setting is Victorian London, and the first thing we see is well-known magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) slip backstage and queer the act of his rival, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) . Angier drowns, Borden is tried, and in prison he is given the dead man's diary, which unleashes the film's back-story.
The mutual vendetta began, we learn, following an onstage tragedy in the two men's youth. Each subsequently vows to best the other in magic and in life: Borden has the skill, Angier has the showmanship, and their loved ones can only look on aghast. These include Rebecca Hall as Borden's increasingly confused wife, Scarlett Johansson as a stage assistant whose heart may or may not belong to both men, and Michael Caine, cackling from the sidelines as the creator of the stage tricks that dazzle the multitudes.
Eventually Borden debuts a number called ``The Transported Man," which drives Angier into a fit of jealousy. His obsession leads him -- why not? -- to the Colorado Springs laboratory of Nikola Tesla, inventor of AC current and himself a rival of Thomas A. Edison. In one of the movie's most felicitous appearing acts, Tesla is played by David Bowie, who acts as if it's perfectly normal for him to be here. Even better: his assistant is played by Andy Serkis -- Gollum of ``The Lord of the Rings , " finally allowed to take human shape.
This is grand, half-crazy fun, and Jackman and Bale are committed to their parts: Genuine madness glints in their eyes. (Johansson, by contrast, appears to have been cast to fill out that eensy-weensy assistant's costume; this is not criticism.) ``The Prestige" begins to spin out of the director's control around this time, though. One shadowy character in particular is easy to identify; once you tumble to that, the game's up.
Worse, ``The Prestige" doesn't play fair to a fundamental rule of the magician-movie genre: That everything that occurs must be physically possible. An element of sci-fi is introduced at a crucial juncture, and while it takes the movie to an interesting (if weird) level, it's hard to shake the sense that someone is cheating.
The title is theater slang referring to the third part of a magic trick. The set-up is called The Pledge, the initial ruse The Turn. The Prestige is the twist that sends you home gobsmacked . Nolan has the first two down perfectly , but the finale requires more sleight of hand than even this skilled prestidigitator can manage.


         "Are you watching closely?" a voice asks at the beginning of "The Prestige." The question, like almost everything else about this passionate, atmospheric entertainment, is a calculated piece of misdirection. No matter how hard you try, you can't be watching this twisty tale closely enough to avoid its elegant traps and snares.
 
  Directed by Christopher Nolan and starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as turn-of-the-century London magicians who engage in a devious and deadly no-holds-barred rivalry, "The Prestige" does more than focus on magicians. It is so in love with the romance, wonder and ability to fool of stage illusion that it becomes something of a magic trick in and of itself
 


         






    Nolan, as usual working from a script he co-wrote with his brother Jonathan, makes full use of the screen's ability to makes us believe in the unbelievable because we've seen it with our own eyes. Taking as their source material an intricate novel by British writer Christopher Priest that won the World Fantasy Award, the Nolans have come up with a film that is trickier still, mixing magic and drama, realistically re-created history and daring science fiction in an especially heady blend.
 
  Intent on keeping us off-balance and unnerved at all times, "The Prestige" presents a head-turning narrative that doubles back and forth between protagonists and time frames in a way that is frankly easier to watch and enjoy than fully explain. Part factual, part fictional, part fantastical, what results verges on being too tricky, on mixing too many genres, but the filmmaking is of such a high order it is hard not to be impressed and entertained.
 
  Nolan, as is often the case (think "Batman Returns," "Insomnia," "Memento"), is concerned here with questions of identity, with what is hidden and what is not. He is also a director who enjoys bringing a modern sensibility to traditional material, who understands that a feeling for realistically conceived characters is essential in making an outsized story compelling.
 
  The characters, as is often the case with rivalries, start out as friends, young magicians in late 19th century London "devoted to their careers and to an ideal," the notion of advancing the art of deception with new tricks that will astonish the world.
 
  As described by Michael Caine's Cutter, an ingeneur
 or designer of elaborate stage illusions, classic tricks have a three-part structure. First is the pledge, wherein a magician shows you something ordinary. Then there's the turn, where you make the ordinary object do something extraordinary. Finally comes the prestige, the hardest part, where "you see something shocking you've never seen before."
 
  Not surprisingly, "The Prestige's" pair of rival magicians take opposite approaches to these basics, extremes that are intensified by shrewd casting, starting with Jackman as Robert Angier, known professionally as the Great Danton. Angier is above all else a natural showman, someone who oozes the kind of charisma no one can match. Especially not Alfred Borden.
 
  But though his showmanship is negligible, Borden, played by Bale, is a born magician who burns with a sometimes self-righteous true believer's determination to make magic that will last. Nolan, who cast Bale as Batman and sees more in him than anyone else, has brought out a latent, awkward warmth in this actor in addition to his usual distance that is essential to the plot.
 
  A series of encounters turns these men into the stone cold bitterest of rivals who rage with enough fury to want to destroy each other's personal as well as professional lives. Since this anger comes out of what happens on stage, it's critical for the magic on film to be convincing, and with the assistance of technical advisors and magicians Ricky Jay (who also has a cameo) and Michael Weber, it definitely is.
 
  As it switches between periods in both careers, "The Prestige" even has each man at one time or another reading the other's secret diary. Women figure in these rivalries (how could they not?), and they are uniformly well played by Piper Perabo as Angier's wife, Rebecca Hall as Borden's, and a nicely pulled-back Scarlett Johansson as a lithesome stage assistant.
 
  Finally, however, these men care more about secrets than people, especially the secret behind a trick of Borden's called the New Transported Man that has Angier take a trip to Colorado to meet with real-life rogue scientist Nikola Tesla. Having this great original played by another great original, David Bowie, was a stroke of casting genius. Bowie gives an immaculate performance, using an undefinable accent to utter gnomic pronouncements to wonderful effect.
 
  Set in a beautifully realized turn-of-the-century London shot (by Wally Pfister) largely with a hand-held camera to heighten its immediacy, "The Prestige" is an adult, provocative piece of work. It's finally about the price that must be paid for immortality in any creative field, about the risk and sacrifice that superlative magic demands. "You've got to get your hands dirty if you're going to do the impossible," someone says, and this ambitious, unnerving melodrama shows exactly what that means.

We think of magic as puckish, elegant, lighter than air, but in The Prestige , an aggressively devious sleight-of-hand thriller directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins ), the magic, even at its most clever, is powered by currents  sometimes literal ones  of electricity and danger. In the Victorian age of high magic showmanship, a woman gets dunked with a violent splash into a glass tank, and it's far from preordained that she'll ever get out. A man makes a bird vanish by smashing its cage; a bullet catcher asks a ruffian in the crowd to fire a gun at him, and the trick turns out to be as hazardous as it sounds. Then there's the enigmatic silver sphere, invented by Thomas Edison's rival Nikola Tesla, that shoots off white bolts of Frankensteinian voltage, teleporting a top hat (or a person) from one place to the next. Magic or technology? Either way, The Prestige  wants to fool your senses by ripping a hole in reality.
It does so with a busy, at times brutal, singlemindedness. Nolan unfurls the parallel stories of two magicians, the sleek showman Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and the brooding virtuoso of illusion Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), the two of whom start as young partners but end up as fierce competitors, trying to top each other's secrets in a fake-out to the death. The Prestige  leaps around in time with dizzy abandon, a deliberate strategy to make magic seem like the most concrete, grounded thing in the movie. It works, though at the expense of giving the audience much room to breathe.
Kicking off with an apparent murder, the movie flashes back to Angier and Borden as they learn the tricks of their trade, abetted by Cutter (Michael Caine), a builder of illusionary hardware who explains the three parts of every great feat of magic: the Pledge (mundane setup), the Turn (which fashions it into something extraordinary), and the Prestige (in which the ordinary is restored with a miraculous twist). This formula of wonder comes alive as each magician lures audiences with his version of the Transported Man, in which the performer enters a door on one side of the stage only to emerge, moments later, from a door on the other side. How Borden achieves his far more amazing version is the movie's pivotal mystery.
Watching The Prestige , you may find yourself longing for a bit of the old-fashioned, streamlined trickery of The Illusionist . Nolan gives his heroes wives, plus an assistant (played by Scarlett Johansson) who becomes the spy/mistress for each man in turn, but the relationships aren't convincing; they're more like setups for illusions  flesh-and-blood versions of the Pledge. The film works best on stage, where Nolan keeps your eyes popped wide in curiosity. His canniest move is to reveal the key to certain tricks, thus upping the ante on the tricks we aren't in on. Jackman, all keen intensity, and Bale, who knows how to push passion to the brink of pathology, are magnetic foils, and David Bowie makes Tesla a turn-of-the-century gentleman freak genius. The Prestige  isn't art, but it reaps a lot of fun out of the question, How did they do that?

 Stuffed with hard-working actors, sleek effects and stagy period details, “The Prestige,” directed by Christopher Nolan from a script he wrote with his brother Jonathan, is an intricate and elaborate machine designed for the simple purpose of diversion.  Set in a stylized late-Victorian world of dueling music-hall magicians and diabolically clever inventors, it has a satisfyingly puzzlelike structure, zipping around in time and scattering clues throughout its busy scenes and frames. Like “Memento,” also directed by Christopher Nolan and based on a story by his brother, “The Prestige” is a triumph of gimmickry, a movie generous enough with its showmanship and sleight of hand to quiet the temptation to grumble about its lack of substance.  The point of a magic trick, after all, is not the content, whatever that might be, but the ingenuity of its conceit and the skill of its execution. And “The Prestige” — the title is a magician’s term of art referring to the climactic surprise that seals a successful trick — manifests an enthusiasm for the nuts and bolts of illusionism that is pretty much irresistible. It is a mock-gothic costume drama with more than a touch of Las Vegas extravagance, a larger-scale, flashier — if ultimately less haunting — relative of “The Illusionist,” another recent cinematic tale of 19th-century abracadabra.  “The Prestige” begins with a death and proceeds through a murder trial and its aftermath, using flashbacks within flashbacks to deepen the mystery it promises to solve and changing points of view to misdirect our attention. At the center are two ambitious young magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale),  also known as the Professor. They start out as friends and fellow apprentices, but quickly become bitter personal and professional rivals. Their enmity stems from an accidental onstage killing, and before long it is hard for them to disentangle the desire for revenge from the impulse toward one-upmanship.    Angier and Borden perform competing versions of the same tricks in different theaters and show up at each other’s performances in disguise, sometimes to steal secrets, sometimes to sabotage tricks and cause public embarrassment.  Angier is the smoother performer, as much an actor as a prestidigitator, and Mr. Jackman, equally at home onstage and on screen, uses his lean, long-legged charisma to good effect. Mr. Bale’s fierce inwardness likewise suits the character of Borden, a working-class striver (Angier is a slumming aristocrat) who is also something of a purist. He disdains Angier’s crowd-pleasing antics in favor of a more stripped-down presentation, challenging his audience rather than charming or seducing it.  Mr. Nolan’s sympathies appear to lie mainly with Borden, but as a director, he has sensibilities  more in line with Angier’s. Much as he respects the rigor of close-hand trickery based on tried-and-true techniques, this filmmaker, whose other movies include “Insomnia” and “Batman Begins,” can hardly resist flights of theatrical and cinematic bravura.  Mr. Bale’s performance, in particular, is something to savor (especially in retrospect, when you at last understand just what he’s been up to), but the acting in “The Prestige” is, for the most part, subordinate to the plot twists and visual sensations. You don’t really go to a magic show to appreciate the commitment to emotional truth displayed by the lovely assistant as she’s being sawed in half. You go to be amazed that, after all the sawing, her body is still in one piece.  Which is as good a time as any to mention the presence of Scarlett Johansson as Angier’s (and then Borden’s) lovely assistant Olivia, one of several more or less unsuspecting parties caught up in the intrigue between the rivals. Ms. Johansson’s English accent is adequate, though she tends lately (here and in “The Black Dahlia”) to be upstaged by her costumes, which appear to be — inadvertently, I’m sure — cut a size too small.  Rebecca Hall plays Borden’s wife, who worries that his commitment to his craft exceeds his devotion to her and their young daughter. The ever-reliable Michael Caine does not exert himself unduly playing Angier’s engineer and manager, but then again, his job is to lull us with his wise, twinkly reassurance so that we don’t see the full dimensions of the story unfolding before us.  That story is nudged to its wildly curlicued ending — don’t worry, I won’t give it away — by David Bowie, whose dry, amusing impersonation of the inventor Nikola Tesla allows the film to brush up gently against the real world. Tesla’s fierce rivalry with Thomas Edison is alluded to, and it suggests an actual historical counterpart to Angier and Borden’s struggle for dominance.  Two inventors can hatch the same idea, just as two magicians can perform the same trick, but only one is likely to be remembered and rewarded, and his victory may depend on cunning, dirty tricks and luck as much as on merit. (A similar contest may now be under way between “The Prestige” and “The Illusionist.”)  Edison, of course, is one of the progenitors of motion pictures, and to cast him as an off-screen heavy is a nice bit of wit. Tesla, meanwhile, who works in an isolated laboratory in the Rocky Mountains, conjures the possibility of innovations that could make the old, mechanical stage magic obsolete, much as digital technology now threatens to supersede the handmade magic of cinema.  But Tesla — who is described as “a wizard” — also introduces an element into the movie that may trouble magic aficionados, whose commitment to techniques of deception is frequently accompanied by a rationalist skepticism toward claims of supernatural power. Serious magicians (like Ricky Jay, who has a cameo here) tend also to be determined debunkers. (Penn & Teller’s Showtime series, the title of which I can’t print here, is part of this tradition, as is Johnny Carson’s famous “Tonight” show humiliation of Uri Geller, who claimed to be able to bend spoons through telekinesis.)  But the Nolans, eager to push the boundaries of their jaw-dropping parlor trick, introduce an element of bunk that compromises the coherence of the film’s concept. At least I suspect that Alfred Borden might think so, which makes me wonder if the filmmakers might not agree. Their slyest move may be to divide “The Prestige,” already caught between two protagonists, against itself. Maybe, in the end, it all makes sense. Or maybe convincing you that it does is just the last and cleverest of this movie’s many sleights of hand.  “The Prestige” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some violent scenes and a scary, menacing atmosphere.

"Every great magic trick has three acts," we're told early on in "The Prestige." Title is lingo for a stage stunt's capper moment. Yet that's precisely where Christopher Nolan's plush period mystery goes from middling to messy. Tale of dueling magicians, played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, takes itself awfully seriously, yet might have ideally suited a 1938 programmer pitting Karloff against Lugosi. Combined high polish, so-so character involvement, and a confusing denouement won't help this handsome production once word-of-mouth trumps alluring advance come-ons.
Pic will also suffer from being "the other" movie about 19th-century professional conjurers, though it's very different from current "The Illusionist." While that pic is essentially a romance, "The Prestige" focuses on the blood feud between American abroad Robert Angier (Jackman) and Cockney Alfred Borden (Christian Bale).
They're introduced as "volunteers" picked from an English music hall audience to bind magician's assistant Julia (Piper Perabo). Plunged into a water tank, she miraculously escapes.
In fact, the two young men are apprentice magicians, secretly a part of the act. Further, Julia is wife to personable Robert. He's a natural showman, while taciturn Alfred is a more gifted illusionist.
But in the name of slick presentation, Alfred takes risks that don't pass muster with safety-minded mentor Cutter (Michael Caine). One day, Alfred ties a more-difficult yoke -- with Julia's permission -- that results in her being unable to free herself; she drowns before an ax can break the glass tank.
Robert is enraged and inconsolable, particularly when he spies Alfred with new wife, Sarah (Rebecca Hall), and baby -- the happy family he feels robbed of.
The men develop separate acts, with Robert's successful while Alfred toils in dives. Nonetheless, Robert remains consumed by thoughts of vengeance. What starts out an exchange of petty humiliations turns into vicious, increasingly violent one-upmanship.
Seeing Alfred perform a stupendous act called "The Transported Man," Robert vows to steal it. When he's unable to figure it out himself, he dispatches onstage assistant and offstage lover Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) to seduce the secret from his rival.
This central chronology is interspersed throughout with dual flash-forward threads. In one, Robert travels to Colorado Springs to petition reclusive inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) to build a machine like the transport he supposedly built for Alfred.
In the other thread, Alfred stands trial for the death of Robert, whom we've seen drown just like his late wife.
While complicated intrigue might have fascinated in Christopher Priest's novel, it tends to overwhelm Jonathan and Christopher Nolan's adaptation. Pic insists on a depth of human emotion that isn't developed -- protags emerge as one-dimensional, despite the efforts of two of our best leading actors -- amid increasingly elaborate, uninvolving plot mechanizations.
Pic's resolution suddenly admits to fantastical and hitherto-unsuspected elements. It's a flame-out likely to send most viewers home perplexed.
Clearly, director Nolan is aiming for something else. But the delight in sheer gamesmanship that marked his breakout "Memento" doesn't survive this project's gimmickry and aspirations toward "Les Miserables"-style epic passion.
Jackman, a familiarly intense Bale, Caine, Johansson (good if risking overexposure these days), and others all hit notes previously played in better roles. On the other hand, perpetually undervalued as an actor Bowie brings an elegant, enlivening edge to Tesla, though that figure's resonance as a real-life enigma will be lost on many.
Several of Nolan's key "Batman Begins" collaborators return here, with Wally Pfister's widescreen lensing, Nathan Crowley's production design and Joan Bergin's costumes the most notable contribs.

If the greatest magicians never reveal their tricks, then Christopher Nolan  wouldn't make it past the children's birthday party circuit. It's not that Nolan has anything against the old hocus-pocus, but it's the practical side of magic that appeals to him mostthe nuts-and-bolts explanation behind the seemingly "impossible" feat.
Magic lies front and center in The Prestige , adapted by Nolan and his brother Jonathan from Christopher Priest 's novel about two competing prestidigitators in turn-of-the-20th-century London. Like many of history and literature's other great adversaries, Robert Angier  (Hugh Jackman ) and Alfred Borden  (Christian Bale ) begin as allies, working as audience plants in the show of a successful stage illusionist (real-life magic expert Ricky Jay ). Night after night they "volunteer" to help the maestro as he binds his lovely assistant Julia (also Angier's wife) with rope and lowers her into the padlocked water tank from which she then miraculously escapes. For Angier, a dashing fop whose stage name belies his blue-blooded lineage, showmanship is everything. For Borden, a ruddy-cheeked Cockney prole who never hesitates to let you know he's had to work for everything he's achieved, the illusion itself is paramount. Then, one night, both things go awry and the water tank becomes Julia's premature grave. A devastated Angier accuses Borden of tying the wrong knotmaybe he didand from that point forward, the two men enter into a contest of revenge and one-upmanship that can seemingly end only with the demise of one. Perchance, not even then.
Unfolding in the fragmented, palimpsestic manner that has become Nolan's favored storytelling style, The Prestige begins with Borden on trial for Angier's murder and then flashes back to show the full bloom of a rivalry that stretches from the streets of London to the wilds of Colorado and from the theaters of the West End  to the laboratory of the beleaguered mad-genius inventor Nikola Tesla  (David Bowie ). There are yet more flashbacks within those flashbacks, before we finally wind our way back to the beginning (or is it the end?) of the tale. Such nonlinear gamesmanship ought to seem like a fatigued parlor trick by now for the director of Memento , but the remarkable thing is that it doesn't. Indeed, where most stories that are this narratively sliced and diced leave you wishing they'd simply been laid out from A  to Z , you don't long to see Nolan's Möbius strip movies any other way. For his great subject is the randomness of memory and those fragments of things past that jut uncomfortably into our present, whether we're an amnesiac widower chasing his own shadow or the dark knight Bruce Wayne  fighting off the specter of his parents' murder in Batman Begins .
In The Prestige , obsession is also the order of the day as Angier and Borden pursue each other for so long that even they can scarcely recall why they fight. Certainly, it is not over Julia, whose loss is quickly forgotten by Angier in his feverish search for the explanation behind Borden's piéce de résistance, an illusion called the Transported Man, which appears to deliver its performer from one end of the stage to the other in less than the blink of an eye. But if Angier and Borden's escalating battle of wits and wills gives The Prestige its dramatic engine, it's also the aspect of the film that appeals to Nolan least. He can't work up much interest in who comes out on top, or in the romantic intrigue that develops when Angier sends his new assistant/lover (Scarlett Johansson ) undercover to seduce the married Borden and steal his secrets. The result is a lopsided yet absorbing movie in which the director is less drawn to his main characters than to those on the peripheryTesla and Angier's wizened illusion designer Cutter (Michael Caine ) and, by extension, all those other men through the ages who have sought to bridge the gap between the real and the illusory.
Directing his first period feature, Nolan has picked the ideal setting for a filmmaker of such rationalist inclinationsthat seismic moment at which the Victorian era began to cave under the weight of the nascent Machine Age. Thus The Prestige , filmed with a minimum of digital chicanery, is at once a lament for the loss of the manual and analog and an awestruck marveling at the possibilities of electricity and mechanization. In one moment of ethereal beauty, Tesla makes a field of oversize lightbulbs burst into brilliant illumination without apparent benefit of wires or generators. And so one is reminded how, for all the wonderment of a Houdini  or a David Copperfield , the true magic of the universe lies in the onward march of science and industry, and in those many things we now take for grantedlike movies themselvesthat once seemed the workings of some terrifying dark art.
