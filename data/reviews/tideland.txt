For certain filmmakers, a disastrous folly is something they have to get out of their system; for others, it's closer to something they have to pass  like a gallstone or stomach gas. Terry Gilliam's dour, absurdist, gruesomely awful Tideland  is of the latter, excretory variety. In the comparatively coherent opening scenes (everything's relative), Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland), a little girl who likes to play with scrappy disembodied doll heads, watches as her mother (Jennifer Tilly), a Nancy Spungen wannabe, expires with a croak from a methadone injection. The girl then goes off  with her rock & roll junkie father (Jeff Bridges), whom she helps to shoot heroin, and a few minutes later he's dead as well, a corpse propped in a chair, with its purplish tongue sticking out.
Tideland  might have taken its cue from that corpse: The movie dies early on, but it keeps hanging around, looking a little more rotten with each new scene. Orphaned, and stranded in a house that sits with arty isolation in a wheat field, Jeliza-  Rose puts on lipstick, nattering to herself like a baby Blanche DuBois, and she makes ''friends'' with the inhabitants, notably a cowering dimwit yokel (Brendan Fletcher) who has a brain-surgery scar laced onto his skull. There's another corpse, a rabbit hole with zero wonder, and  why not?  a flirtation with pedophilia. But trying to decipher the ''signs'' of Tideland  will get you nowhere. The only way to make sense of the film is to read it as a splatter painting of disgust...at a movie industry that Gilliam feels shut out by, and at the audience that he has apparently decided to punish as well.

 Shot in bright, saturated color and set in a landscape of tall grass and wide-open space, “Tideland” unfolds on the borderline between fantasy and reality, which is familiar territory for its director, Terry Gilliam. In movies like “The Fisher King,” “The Adventures of Baron Munchausen” and “The Brothers Grimm” he has set out for that frontier, but this time he has stumbled into a different no-man’s land, the one between the merely bad and the completely indefensible.  To make a long movie short: Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland, who turned 10 while the film was being made) is the young child of two heroin addicts. Mom checks out early, and Dad (Jeff Bridges) does not stay around much longer — though his rotting (and later embalmed) body lingers. After a while I started to envy him, since duty required me to stay alive and awake for two hours during which misery masqueraded as whimsy and vice versa.  Jeliza-Rose, who charmingly cooks up her father’s fixes and lovingly removes the hypodermic from his arm as he nods off, takes refuge in make-believe from the tawdriness of her existence. Her confidants and companions are three severed dolls’ heads, and eventually some eccentric neighbors who seem like fairy-tale characters but are really a gothic sister-and-brother duo named Dell (Janet McTeer) and Dickens (Brendan Fletcher).  Jeliza-Rose’s encounters with them are filmed with Mr. Gilliam’s characteristic verve: swooshing camera movements, tilted frames, luridly exaggerated acting. The aesthetic is at once grotesque and dreamy, but not coherently so, since no distinction is made between the filmmaker’s perception and his heroine’s. The movie is as full of unmodulated shrieking, thumping and bric-a-brac as an amateur puppet show. The director places a heavy burden on young Ms. Ferland. To fully convey the registers of Jeliza-Rose’s consciousness — the delicate shadings of terror and self-consoling fancy, the volatile mix of precocity and innocence — is an enormous challenge, and rather than supporting her in it Mr. Gilliam uses her wide-eyed cuteness and her chirpy, Southern-accented voice as crutches.  The worst that can be said of the first two-thirds of “Tideland” is that it is tiresome. Toward the end it becomes creepy, and not in a good way. The sexuality of children, and its exploitation by adults, is about as delicate a subject as a movie can address, but a film like Gregg Araki’s “Mysterious Skin” proves that it can be done with seriousness and integrity, neither of which is in evidence here. Instead, Mr. Gilliam descends into curdled silliness. It might be said that his imagination knows no boundaries; it might be good if he found some.  “Tideland” is rated R. It has drug use, gruesome deaths and extremely icky sexual implications.

Made back-to-back with Terry Gilliam's somewhat commercial but roundly panned "The Brothers Grimm," indie-produced "Tideland" sees the fanciful helmer overindulging his dark side with a slice of Gothic nastiness. Story about an imaginative orphan living alone under open skies is anchored by an ace perf from tyke thesp Jodelle Ferland, and features the helmer's signature spooky production design, but is dragged down by a sputtering script and torpid pacing. Way too disturbing for kids and too weird for most grown-ups, "Tideland" is likely to wash up in boutique distribution where Gilliam's name will pull in only his most devoted fan base.

Largely faithful to the poetic, well-received novel by Mitch Cullin, screenplay filters the story through the eyes of young heroine Jeliza-Rose (witchy-eyed 10-year-old Ferland), the precocious only child of rock guitarist Noah (Jeff Bridges, almost unrecognizable at first) and the fancifully named Queen Gunhilda (Jennifer Tilly), a bedridden hysteric with a long, blond fright-do.
A funhouse-mirror version of familial happiness features Jeliza-Rose as mother's little helper, obediently cooking syringes full of heroin for each parent. The so-called grown-ups are preoccupied with their own obsessions (the boggy Danish region of Jutland for dad, chocolate for mom). Jeliza-Rose's only friends are doll heads she's torn from their bodies and turned into finger puppets she talks to.
When Gunhilda dies from an overdose, Jeliza-Rose has to persuade Noah not to give the corpse an incendiary Viking-style send off in their apartment.
Noah buses with Jeliza-Rose to his mother's home somewhere on the prairie (pic was filmed in Saskatchewan), where he grew up. His mother appears to have died, and the broken-down house, the look of which recalls the famous Andrew Wyeth painting "Christina's World," is empty, covered in dust and cobwebs.
As Jeliza-Rose sets about exploring the house's creepy corners and the rippling wheat fields outside, Noah settles down in an armchair to "go on vacation," this time permanently, with another dose of smack. Jeliza-Rose either doesn't understand or refuses to believe he's dead, and when his corpse begins to smell and discolor (growing progressively more hideous as the film goes on), she applies make-up to it and dresses it in her grannie's blond wig.
Wandering through the fields with her doll heads, Jeliza-Rose soon meets the black-clad Dell (Janet McTeer), a woman from Noah's past with one cloudy eye and an obsession with taxidermy that soon comes in handy. Living with Dell is her mentally challenged brother Dickens (Brendan Fletcher), with whom Jeliza-Rose develops a queasy-making, quasi-sexual relationship.
From the point at which Noah dies, pic is stippled with fantastical do-dahs like talking squirrels, doll's heads that momentarily come to life, and clouds of CGI fireflies, but not a lot really happens for 90-odd minutes until a morbid, shock ending arrives.
Pic's atmosphere of dirty realism never ripens beyond a juvenile flirtation with the macabre, which might have played more effectively with a 75-minute running time instead one of 122.
Out of a good cast hamming it up by necessity to fit the pic's fairy-tale vibe, young but already experienced thesp Ferland ("They") grounds the movie nicely with a piquant turn. Even when her character is play-acting at being mannered and self-conscious, Ferland's perf remains spontaneous and natural.
While pic's American Gothic production design is packed with detail in typical Gilliam style, the film looks positively Spartan compared with the ungainly clutter of "The Brothers Grimm." Make-up and prosthetics work executed to render Noah's corpse, and eventually the stuffed and varnished bodies seen later on, are as impressively realistic as they are lurid. Widescreen lensing by Nicola Pecorini, using distorting lens and searing cascades of sunlight, enhances the mood and makes the film more bearable.

It hardly seems possible but Terry Gilliam 's courageously repellent Tideland the movie he reportedly abandoned The Brothers Grimm  to makehas actually found a distributor.
Adapting an essentially plotless novel by Mitch Cullin , Gilliam presents an American Gothic Alice in Wonderland . Little Alice is Jeliza-Rose (Jodelle Ferland , who turned 10 during the shoot), the logorrheic offspring of two flaming junkies (Jennifer Tilly 's Courtney Love like slattern and Jeff Bridges 's flatulent Captain Pissgums). She used to mix up their medicine, and with their demise becomes a solo act. Her unending babble of make-believe constructs a psychotic Wonderland out of two derelict farmhouses, creepy enough to have been furnished by the Wisconsin cannibal Ed Gein . Local creatures include Jeliza-Rose's collection of Barbie doll  heads, several talking rodents, and the neighborsa one-eyed witchy beekeeper cum taxidermist (Janet Mc- Teer) and her lobotomized brother (played by Brendan Fletcher  as a drooling parody of Forrest Gump ).
Tideland  is beautifully shota provocation in that the precise, windswept Andrew Wyeth  compositions and delicate autumnal atmosphere are rendered increasingly rank by a conjured miasma of barfing, farting, and human decomposition. At one point Gilliam quotes Un Chien Andalou , the first movie to conceive itself as a direct assault on the spectator. Indeed, the Toronto audience with which I saw Tideland  last year responded as though being water-boardeda 15-minute immersion had people gasping for the exits, recapitulating the movie's plot by leaving poor Jodelle to her own devices. (The actress's performance is extraordinary, although, it would seem, potentially traumatizing.)
Increasingly grotesque in its intimations of pedophilia, Tideland  ends with a comic train wreck. This finale could hardly be more appropriate in that the movie seems to have been made for rubbernecking. Gilliam has suffered more than his share of butchered projects, but with this exercise in kamikaze auteurism, he appears to have made exactly the mess he wanted.
