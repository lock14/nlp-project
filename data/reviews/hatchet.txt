Hatchet
, the debut feature from Adam Green, picked up a slew of awards at last year's Fantastic Fest, and it's easy to see why: No other film in recent memory has featured such a terrifically retro maniac or revisited the heyday of Eighties gore films with such gleeful, moist abandon. Hatchet
 (whose malformed antagonist resembles nothing so much as the bifurcated nightmare from Tobe Hooper's The Funhouse
 by way of South Park
's rendering of Barbra Streisand) is manna from, well, probably not heaven, per se, but certainly some sort of Fangoria
n paradise. It's smart, too, and although it never quite goes down the meta-horror route of Wes Craven's Scream
 films, Green and his very game cast keep things lively with a steady stream of genre references (Robert "Freddy Krueger" Englund and Kane "Jason Voorhees" Hodder both show up in substantial cameos, as does Candyman
's Todd), quippy dialogue, and a nail-biter's wet dream of endless, inventively gagtastic gore effects � courtesy of John Carl Buechler (From Beyond
). All of this is edited to within a freshly flayed maxillary muscle of its life (or death
) and set to a driving, tonally perfect orchestral score by Andy Garfield. The story itself is a crafty variation on the genre's hoary theme of young outsiders growing up to wreak vengeance on teenage hoi polloi, which imbues the proceedings with an instant sense of homey, if gooey, familiarity. Buddies Ben (Moore) and Marcus (Richmond), celebrating Mardi Gras in New Orleans, sign up for a "haunted swamp tour" along with a group of other, more disposable special-effects-to-be, and end up pursued by the aforementioned bayou freak show. It's simplicity itself, really, and Green is to be congratulated for keeping the proceedings as uncomplicated as they are. It should, by this point, be apparent that Hatchet
 is strictly for gore and genre enthusiasts only � matrons and Medveds likely will end up gibbering in the aisle should they attempt a viewing. Why this sudden resurgence in ultraviolent horror, � la Hostel
, Saw
, and Black Sheep
? Call it wartime catharsis; call it the cinematic shards of a zeitgeist's shattered mirror; call it the Reagan Years Redux; call it whatever you choose. Just don't call it squeamish.

         "Hatchet" is billed as "Old-School American Horror," and "school" would seem to be the operative word. It feels like a student film -- one that wouldn't make the grade.
 
 The plot involves a confused bayou legend about a deformed kid whose bloodthirsty spirit seeks revenge for its tortured life. Visitors on a scare tour find themselves picked off by this angry Elephant Man look-alike, the only suspense being whose death will be the most ridiculous. There's no logic to the chase; the soon-to-be-victims just hang around waiting to die. This is one of those movies where the fodder, er, characters repeatedly incapacitate the monster but run away instead of trying to kill it.
 


         






   One hesitates to hack such an obviously entry-level effort to bits, but this is a bad film. And it's not enjoyably bad; it offers little diversion for your admission money. It's not even writer-director Adam Green's first movie (that dubious honor goes to 2000's "Coffee & Donuts"), so that excuse doesn't apply.
 
 Green seems to be trying for comedy with lame dialogue and exaggeratedly fake limb-rending but lacks the skill to pull it off, so to speak. The only laugh occurs when a victim receiving an impromptu splenectomy whines, "Aaah! It hurts!" -- and that over-the-top humor may have been unintentional.
 
 The performances are charmless. Somnambulant lead Joel Moore ("Dodgeball") wakes only when impaled. Comic-relief sidekick Deon Richmond ("Van Wilder") tries hard but can't rise above the non-guffaw-inducing material.
 
 The cast is dotted with other familiar faces such as Tony Todd ("Candyman") and Richard Riehle (more than 180 credits, among them "Office Space"), and includes the obligatory Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger) cameo, so the film wasn't shot for $5 in someone's backyard; it just looks like it was.
 
 Precious little brain power was expended in the making of this movie. It's more than halfway through the ordeal when we're finally told what the presumably scary story is. And why is the movie called "Hatchet"? Its only memorable implement of death looks like a belt sander. "Belt Sander" would have been as apt a title as any -- assuming "Boring Trudge Through Some Dude's Backyard" was deemed bad for marketing.
 
 By "old school," they apparently mean the filmmakers aspire to the minuscule heights of '80s "Friday the 13th"-style yawningly-unkillable-slasher flicks. Because those are so very rare these days. Even after appropriately lowering expectations, it's kind to call this one a cut below.

 Opening like a Mardi Gras edition of “Girls Gone Wild” and closing with a reverent nod to “Friday the 13th,” “Hatchet,” a Bayou-based homage to the slasher giants of yesteryear, is more concerned with touchstones than with terror. The movie may proudly  assemble its bodily fluids the old-fashioned way — that is, with  care and K-Y jelly — but absent any tension, it’s all just so much splatter.  Stranded in the middle of a supposedly haunted swamp, a boatload of the usual mismatched tourists — including a pretend pornographer and his aspiring starlets — is gradually and creatively dismembered. Their assailant is one Victor Crowley (Kane Hodder), a typically sad monster whose misshapen appearance and facility with power tools  suggest a genetic collision between the Elephant Man and the home design guru Ty Pennington. As played by Mr. Hodder — an actor with Jason Voorhees under his belt and the useful ability to vomit on command — Victor easily steals the show.  Affectionately written and directed by Adam Green, “Hatchet”  refers to everything from “Dawson’s Creek” to the “Candyman” films (whose star, the wonderful Tony Todd, has a lively cameo) while raising more giggles than goosebumps. Horror without suspense is like sex without love: you can appreciate the technicalities,  but ultimately there’s no reason to care.  “Hatchet” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Characters are impaled, disemboweled and  beheaded by a psycho, as well as repeatedly terrorized by half-naked women.
