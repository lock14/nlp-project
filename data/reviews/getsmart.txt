The track record for movies based on old TV shows hasn�t been pretty, yet that hasn�t stopped Hollywood from spinning the wheel on these proven concepts again and again. Happily, the new movie Get Smart
 survives the transition, maybe not with flying colors but at least with a respectable amount of wind in its sails. Updating this late-Sixties TV spy spoof, which was created by comedy-writing gods Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, is fraught with potential perils. Although the TV show can be grouped with such series as The Man From U.N.C.L.E.
 and I Spy
 and the movie Casino Royale
 as late-Sixties retorts to the James Bond fantasy and a growing American paranoia about the activities of the CIA, it was Get Smart
 that tweaked that government agency with an extra dash of sass and wit. The utter ineptitude of Maxwell Smart, aka Agent 86, stands as a rebuke to the idea of the infallibility of the covert intelligence agent. As played by Carell in this new film, Smart is not as big an idiot as he was in the original. Here he�s a novice field agent who�s just been promoted from his desk job as a CONTROL analyst, which explains some of his bumbling, but he can shoot his gun straight when necessary and assess situations with intelligence. Carell�s Smart also has shades of the character he plays on The Office
, Michael Scott, in the characters' shared lack of self-awareness. As Smart�s partner, Agent 99, Hathaway is a spooky doppelg�nger for Barbara Feldon, with her chic Chanel-like duds and confident verbal delivery. Fortunately, the movie tamps down 99�s 100% devotion to Smart as a romantic partner � a foible that would be even more inexplicable 40 years later. As good as Carell and Hathaway are, no palpable sexual tension can be perceived. The catchphrases from the original (�sorry about that, chief,� �missed it by that
 much,� the �cone of silence�) are all here but used with appropriate discretion in order to not wear out their welcome. This is especially evident in the early part of the movie, when the characters are at headquarters and Smart is still a desk jockey who analyzes terrorist �chatter� and longs to enter the field. Once he is removed from headquarters, Get Smart
 often struggles with the impulse to also be an action comedy, and the plot and the staging just don�t live up to those demands. A climax with the president (Caan) at a symphony performance recalls the conclusion of Hitchcock�s The Man Who Knew Too Much
, with no other similarities to the master other than the plot device. The film reunites Carell with his Little Miss Sunshine
 co-star Arkin, who, as always, delivers the goods, as do most of the other supporting players. Too long by at least 15-20 minutes, Get Smart
 is nevertheless a giggly summer movie.


'Get Smart' is fun, but lacks zany intelligence of TV series

Missed it by that much.
Mel Brooks and Buck Henry, creators of the original "Get Smart" TV show back in 1965, are credited as consultants on the new blockbuster film of the same name. The producers should have handed them the script. "Get Smart," version 2008, surrounds skilled, likable players, and a handful of solid belly laughs with $80 million worth of formulaic summer-movie mediocrity. A lot of things explode, but the movie never detonates.
That may be because the original show made rude fun of spy-movie cliches, whereas director Peter Segal ("50 First Dates," "Anger Management") just caves in to them. The new Maxwell Smart (Steve Carell) may be a boob, but in the clutch he's a standard action hero with comic trimmings. The movie lacks the courage to make Max a genuine idiot; it also lacks the late Don Adams, who had the unique ability to make snippy cluelessness funny.
"Get Smart" does have Anne Hathaway, whose elegant visual lines and cool way with a retort as Agent 99 bear comparison with the show's Barbara Feldon. Better, it has Alan Arkin as the chief of top-secret spy organization CONTROL, updating Ed Platt's original with dry belligerence. Arkin, who gets off the movie's single funniest line (it involves a swordfish) continues his post-"Little Miss Sunshine" late-career roll; simply put, every summer tent pole should have him.
The problem is the script by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember ("Failure to Launch"), which mistakes boilerplate pee-pee jokes for the enthusiastic toilet humor that was Brooks's later specialty. (When in doubt, someone here always seems to get a paintball to the crotch.) Another offender is Richard Pearson's stop-and-start editing, consistently halting the comic momentum before it can build to real lunacy. The calculus for each scene is unwavering - TV show reference, slam-bang action, wisecrack - and it wears thin fast.
To his credit, Carell doesn't go for a Don Adams impression. His Maxwell Smart is more unlucky than bumbling, a former fatty who just wants to be the best field agent in the bureau, and damned if that miniature crossbow doesn't keep firing into his face.
That said, the movie errs by turning Max into a figure of hangdog sympathy: The 40 Year Old Virgin with a shoe phone. What's missing is the fatuousness that made Adams's original so oddly endearing and that was mined more successfully by Rowan Atkinson in the sloppier (and funnier) "Johnny English." The joke of the character is that no one takes Max seriously but himself.
But "Get Smart" takes everything a little too seriously, including the warmed-over plot about criminal KAOS mastermind Siegfried (Terence Stamp, looking mortified) planning to blow up Los Angeles with hijacked Chechnya nukes. (The TV series' Siegfried, Bernie Kopell, gets a cameo in the film.)
Do we really need revelations of double agents and a heroic, high-speed freeway fistfight over a briefcase containing nuclear stop-codes? Much more satisfying is the earlier scene in which Max and 99 infiltrate a Russian soiree seeking information: Carell's tango with the hefty Lindsay Hollister recalls the dance of the hippos in "Fantasia," and there's a bit with laser beams that feels like a blast of authentically vulgar Mel Brooks shtick.
"Get Smart" does pause for all the beloved catchphrases and set pieces. The Cone of Silence gets a clever update, and David Koechner turns fellow agent Larrabee into an amusing doofus; there's a glimpse of Hymie the Robot (Patrick Warburton) and a wonderful, all-too-brief scene featuring lonesome Bill Murray as Agent 13, forever stuck in that tree costume.
Just as many good actors are hung out to dry, though, including Dwayne Johnson (per the credits, no longer The Rock) as the smoothly capable Agent 23, James Caan as a US president who's a bigger idiot than Max, and Ken Davitian - Borat's portly foil - as Siegfried's henchman.
Hathaway is game but misused, too, for the simple reason that the unspoken romantic tension that kept the TV series purring for so long is addressed too quickly here. Max sees 99, gets a crush, game over. "Get Smart" the show jumped the shark when Max and 99 got married in the fourth season. Would you believe the movie doesn't make it to the second hour?


In Get Smart , an homage (would you believe a remake? How about a retrofitting?) of the hit 1960s satiric sitcom about an American spy who bumbled his way through the Cold War with the help of a pre-Steve Jobs shoe phone at his ear, Steve Carell and Anne Hathaway play secret agent Maxwell Smart (who's not so) and Agent 99 (who's a dish). The pair work for CONTROL, a U.S. spy agency led by a suitably dyspeptic Alan Arkin as The Chief; the bad guys work for KAOS, an all-purpose, international bad guy clearing house led by a properly villainous Terence Stamp as Siegfried. (Clearly, there's no longer a market for easy-to-identify Soviet bad guys.)
You'd think the passing of time, and the evolved tastes of generations of younger moviegoers not naturally attuned to the Friars Club kibitzing and political satire of Brooks and Henry, would make the movie a mission: impossible. But you'd be wrong. Written by Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember and directed by Peter Segal with efficiency, cheer, and a refreshing lack of look-how-meta-clever-we-are egotism, the movie references just enough of the original touchstones and punchlines (the cone of silence, the not-ready-for-James-Bond gadgets) to please those who lived it the first time. (Okay, those who lived it the first time, or at least appreciate Brooksian goons named Shtarker and Noodnik Shpilkes are at an advantage.) Yet those who missed the '60s by that  much (or even more) ought to appreciate the movie's notably clever action sequences, and the fine pseudo-superman self-mockery of Dwayne Johnson as Agent 23. Carell is an expectedly good fit to step into the Smart shoes (with or without secret phone) originally worn by comedian Don Adams. But the unexpected star is Hathaway, looking cool as a runway model in the role originated by Barbara Feldon, lithe as a (pink) panther, and displaying great comic timing.

 Reviewing a movie like “Get Smart” is pretty much like writing about the new packaging of a laundry detergent. The box may be a brighter orange, the label a little louder (Improved! Kind Of!), but the stuff inside is pretty much the same as the stuff inside every box of detergent. And, in this case, the stuff inside consists of exactly what most Hollywood movies based on old sitcoms are made of, namely feeble and funny jokes, brand actors and enough special effects to give you some bang for your summertime buck.  The most crucial of those recognizable faces in the “Get Smart” movie belongs to the comic actor Steve Carell, putting an amusing deadpan spin on the blundering CONTROL spy Maxwell Smart, or Agent 86, the role originated by Don Adams.  Created by Mel Brooks and Buck Henry amid a pop-culture spy craze fueled by the cold war and Ian Fleming, Max was the borscht belt Bond, the seemingly inexpert, ambiguously ethnic  American operative who, starting in 1965 and armed with broad jokes, slapstick and a capable female sidekick, Agent 99 (Barbara Feldon, a cool number), somehow for five seasons managed to come out on top. He was the original revenge of the nerds, a goofball answer to all those Yale-schooled spooks.  Despite some nips and tucks and a back story involving a fat suit, the updated movie Max isn’t that different from the television version. Everything looks pricier, of course, what with the shiny sets filled with blinking screens and busy-looking extras, many of whom are on hand only so that they can be blown to smithereens. Max appears somewhat costlier too, sleeker, as does 99 (leggy, pretty, harmless Anne Hathaway). A pleasant-looking man whose dark, pleading eyes suggest reserves of decency and a deep well of panic, Mr. Carell makes for a markedly different presence from Mr. Adams, a stand-up comic who delivered all his dialogue like one-liners and seemed two jokes and one unfastened brassiere away from a gig at the Playboy Mansion.  Mr. Carell’s deadpan and implied decency go a long way toward making “Get Smart” work as well as it does. He has been given a boost by the filmmakers — the director Peter Segal and the writers Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember — who, while making sure that you laugh at Max, also make sure you never laugh too hard or for too long. It’s one thing for Max to be funny, to be an intermittent impotent foil. But if he’s to carry the day and maybe even a franchise, he has to be genuinely heroic. He has to fill up the big screen with action, not just laughs and dusty catchphrases. He has to deliver the goods by also throwing a few hard punches.  For the most part Mr. Carell does just that, going through the formulaic paces without wilting, despite the exhausting 111-minute run time. The movie is far from terrible: it’s amusing in spots (Bill Murray shows up for an eccentric cameo) and visually painless, notably during the nighttime beauty shots of Moscow that show the digital video format off to fine effect.  There are also diverting supporting turns from the hard-working Dwayne Johnson, as CONTROL’s resident smooth-groover and Alan Arkin as its hot-tempered boss. Terence Stamp’s somnolent turn as Siegfried, an agent for KAOS — an enemy agency — with no notable kinks other than a love of Beethoven, only adds a touch of nostalgia for real Terence Stamp performances.  Having ended before Watergate-fueled paranoia could seep in, “Get Smart” is, like all shows in syndication, an imperfect time capsule, less a reflection of its historical moment than of its commercial imperatives.  It probably seemed ready for a big-screen redo because operatives and agencies are headline news again, but there’s too much money at stake in a movie like this for reality to intrude. The filmmakers take tiny, tinny digs at the vice president and cook up a subplot about yellowcake uranium and a pathetic bit about a guy in a turban on a plane. They even have a president (James Caan) who can’t pronounce nuclear properly and reads “Goodnight Moon” to the kiddies as the country teeters on the brink. None of it sticks.  Stanley Kubrick could have made doomsday funny (wait, he did), but a movie like “Get Smart,” engineered for big laughs and little pain, can only lob cotton balls. It flounders whenever it tries to weave the real world into its fantasia, partly because it isn’t really about anything other than making money, partly because the spy-versus-spy battle doesn’t entertain the way it once did.  There was nothing particularly innocent about the time period when “Get Smart” was originally broadcast, but neither was the spy game shrouded in cynicism. Secret agents were still glamorous then, grist for romance and ripe for parody. But watching Max and company run amok just gave me the creeps. I don’t know about you, but I’m sick of bumbling spies.    “Get Smart” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Gun violence without the blood. 

It seemed like a natural: Redo "Get Smart," the landmark '60s TV spy spoof, with Steve Carell. Who better to update Maxwell Smart -- the idiot-savantish secret agent originated by Don Adams -- than "The Office's" master of disassociative, self-effacing humor? But in the end, a bigscreen version of television's "Get Smart" had issues to address -- the hero was too one-dimensional, the female lead too adoring, the Cold War too over. So helmer Peter Segal's formulaic takeoff is neither fish nor fowl, not quite faithful to the show, but not quite bringing it into the 21st century either. It may ride Carell's star to major B.O., at least initially. But it's nothing you want to take off your shoe and call home about. 
In changing the tone of the original NBC sitcom, Segal's "Get Smart" creates a more endearing Max. Scripters Tom J. Astle and Matt Ember have concocted an origin story that tells how Maxwell Smart became the man he was: Rather than the Inspector Clouseau-esque, oblivious-to-insult, hero played by Adams, Carell's Max is an eager, sincere, sensitive, efficient analyst for the mysterious U.S. espionage agency CONTROL.
He's a first-rate wonk, but he longs to be an agent in the field. He wants to fight and shoot. He passes the agent's exam with flying colors. But as the Chief (Alan Arkin) tells him, he's too valuable where he is. So Max is destined to stay indoors (many doors, slamming shut behind him) and prepare his notoriously boring reports for the likes of Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson), who is out there every day making the world safe for democracy.
It is only when KAOS -- CONTROL's nemesis, led by the evil Siegfried (a thoroughly wasted Terence Stamp) -- manages to compromise virtually every CONTROL agent that Max gets his long-dreamed-of promotion -- and the movie gets going.
There's no one else the Chief can to turn to, except Agent 99 (Anne Hathaway), who's had a total rhinoplastic makeover and is thus still under cover. Can Max rise to the challenge? Can he survive his partnership with 99?
There's a lot of nodding and winking toward the old show, including Max's musical march through the multiple security gates that also introduced the Mel Brooks/Buck Henry-created series. This is a good thing, because otherwise we might forget that we're watching "Get Smart" at all.
We might, in fact, imagine we'd wandered into some other cookie-cutter comedy, one in which we expect romance-edged jousting between principals. This is the biggest tonal change from the original "Get Smart": Agent 99, who was played in the '60s by Barbara Feldon as a Max-worshipping vamp (and who was better at spying than Max was), has become someone more independent, but also a little shrewish. Hathaway's 99 is more capable than Max but isn't prepared to do anything to mollify the ego of her less-experienced partner.
On the contrary, theirs is a relationship based on competition and bickering -- which is, frankly, all very conventional spy-vs.-spy/war-of-the-sexes stuff that abandons the daffy spirit that Brooks and Henry cooked up. Granted, times have changed, and a compliant 99 might not cut it with contemporary audiences. But a lot of the comedy seems to have been lost in the translation.
On one hand, Carell is a total nerd; on the other, he's too self-aware and nuanced to be an homage to the original Max. The genius of his Michael Scott on "The Office" doesn't come through here, and it might have, because Scott and (the original) Maxwell Smart share a clinical distance from their fellow humans that accounts for, and perhaps excuses, their behavior.
Carell's Max is decent, deserving, subtly witty and comic, which makes him far more appropriate as both a Carell character and a modern hero. But he's not always a perfect fit as the centerpiece of spy farce.
There is a lingering affection among some groups for the TV show, and among young auds for Carell, who has shown that he is perfectly capable of stretching as an actor, as in "Little Miss Sunshine." But otherwise, why redo "Get Smart" if you are going to discard the elements that defined your inspiration?

As old Broadway shows are revived, new Broadway shows get spun from old movies so that new movies may be fashioned from ancient TV series. It's an iron law of the culture industry that turns out to be a pleasant surprise in the case of Get Smart  , the late-'60s sitcom retooled as a vehicle for Steve Carell .
The most successful of the half-dozen spy shows that materialized in 1965— a year after the Pop Art success of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. — the original Get Smart  was distinguished less by its absurdist attitude (the show was conceived by Mel Brooks  and Buck Henry ) than by its catch phrases and casting. Stand-up comedian Don Adams  drew on his nightclub William Powell  impersonation to play Maxwell Smart , the dense, inept, officious Agent 86, teamed with über–'60s girl Barbara Feldon  as the fabulously sexy, competent, and inexplicably adoring Agent 99.
Surprisingly resilient for a show based on a single joke, Get Smart  ran for five seasons, inspired a 1980 Hollywood  flop (The Nude Bomb ), and, nine years later, a more successful made-for-TV movie. (In between, Adams provided something close to his Maxwell Smart persona for the animated series Inspector Gadget , as well as reviving Smart to shill for Kmart  and White Castle .) Fox actually brought the series back to life in 1995, with Adams and Feldon and, as a chip off the block, Andy Dick . All residual pop irony was trumped in 2002, when the most celebrated of the show's ridiculous props, the shoe phone, appeared in an exhibit at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library .
As directed by Peter Segal  from a script by the authors of the Matthew McConaughey –Sarah Jessica Parker  romantic comedy Failure to Launch , Get Smart  redux is less a parody of a genre that had already passed into self-parody many moons before the TV show was in reruns, and more an all-purpose (and often quite funny) goofball action comedy in which ridiculous banter alternates with slapstick car chases and mid-air stunts. Segal, who has shepherded our reigning cartoon floats—Adam Sandler , Chris Rock , Eddie Murphy —through their parades, directs with relative restraint. No gag is held too long, and many one-liners are tossed off with impressive savoir faire. (In a bow to Mel Brooks, one character introduces himself as Nudnik Shpilkes.)
Although slapstick, the movie has been umade for the tele-literate—recycling many of the TV show's catch phrases, along with shards of its musical theme. Agent 86, however, gets softened. No less deadpan or baroquely bumbling than the Adams original, Carell's Smart is actually smarter. He's also more lovably neurotic—a know-it-all intelligence analyst obsessed with his weight who dreams of becoming a real spy, like the heroic hunk Agent 23 (Dwayne Johnson ). Thanks to a national catastrophe, he gets his promotion and becomes obnoxiously competitive once partnered with the dishy but acerbic 99, played by Anne Hathaway . In the movie's best stretch of physical comedy, Hathaway disguises herself as Barbara Feldon to attend a Russian oligarch's ball and winds up engaging Carell in a bout of cut-throat mambo one-upmanship. (Hathaway, whose lush looks tend to overshadow her abilities, is not only a talented actress but a graceful cut-up.)
First telecast less than two years after the Kennedy assassination and lingering on past the invasion of Cambodia , the original Get Smart  was a priori anti-patriotic in making a mockery, week after week, of the CIA. (Mission Impossible , which made its debut in 1966, was the supportive antidote to such derision.) Although acknowledging the post-9/11 world, the movie Get Smart  has no political subtext beyond a mild but persistent hostility toward the Bush administration. (On the eve of destruction, the president, played by James Caan , reads Goodnight Moon  to a class of restless first-graders.)
Given that the whole notion of military intelligence has been pretty much discredited—or rendered postmodern in its lack of a fixed meaning—there's not much here to upset anyone. Still, it did seem that the number of triumphant fist bumps exchanged by the characters might strike the hysterics at Fox News  as unduly terroristical. If so, the movie's sure sorry about that.
