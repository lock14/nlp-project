 Although four stories, three fictional and one real, are folded together in Eric Khoo’s elliptical film “Be With Me,” the tale that gives this delicate, melancholic movie its backbone is the true one of its courageous central character, Theresa Chan. A deaf and blind Singaporean woman in her early 60’s who plays herself in the movie, Ms. Chan is an indomitable life force and charismatic screen presence. Even after she concludes her account of transcending the “silent, dark prison” of her disabilities with the help of gifted teachers, you are left wondering how she did it.  Remarkably self-sufficient, Ms. Chan is shown carefully washing her own dishes at home and teaching pottery to children at a school for the blind in Singapore. Although she can’t hear, she occasionally speaks intelligible sentences in a rough, loud voice.  Her few spoken words notwithstanding, “Be With Me” is a largely silent movie built around a contradiction: it’s a film about communication whose spare dialogue  is scattered among four languages (English, Cantonese, Hokkien and Mandarin), five if you count Braille. More information is conveyed  through reading and physical touch than through speech.  “Be With Me” looks askance at cyber styles of instant communication, with abbreviated words and phrases, in which a relationship can be erased by pressing “delete.” Images of Singapore’s sleek, modern skyline crowded with anonymous, nearly identical towers accentuate the movie’s view of urban life today as a chilly, impersonal wasteland.  The film begins with words pecked out on an old manual typewriter: “Is true love truly there, my love? Yes, if your warm heart is.” The fingers typing them belong to Ms. Chan, who applies the question to the movie’s fictional stories, each of which involves a different generation. One follows the puppyish fling of two teenage girls who meet by computer; another contemplates the plight of a lonely, overweight security guard who silently pines for a yuppie woman who works in his office building.  In the saddest and deepest, an aged shopkeeper (Chiew Sung Ching) cooks meals for his ailing wife and takes them to her in the hospital. When she eventually dies, he still feels her presence in the shop as he silently goes about his daily life, crumpled in grief. His discovers his will to continue after reading Ms. Chan’s autobiography, and through his son (Lawrence Yong), a social worker, sends her his delicious home cooking. She relays a message back that she loves his food.  These three fictional tales are seemingly unrelated until they intersect haphazardly at the end of the movie. Once the young lovers Jackie (Ezann Lee) and Sam (Samantha Tan) connect online, they enjoy a frisky idyll until Sam meets a boy she likes and abruptly cuts off Jackie, who is plunged into a suicidal despair. Meanwhile, Fatty Koh (Seet Keng-yew), the security guard, who is middle-aged, painfully shy and lives at home with his disapproving parents, is fired after falling asleep on the job. He discreetly stalks the young woman who works in his building,  even after he’s fired, and spends much of the movie composing a love letter.  Ms. Chan’s infinitely harder struggle could have been used to throw a harsher light on the younger characters and their unhappiness. But this gentle film examines them with a detachment that is not unsympathetic.  After going deaf at 14, Ms. Chan soon went blind and sank into despair that lasted until the revelatory moment when she realized that “it didn’t matter as long as I was alive.” Helped by two dedicated teachers, she studied in the United States, even learned English (she spoke only Cantonese) and became the strong, unsentimental, amazingly independent woman we see on screen.  The fact that her story of triumph over unimaginable odds doesn’t come freighted with mystical and religious bromides makes it all the more inspiring.

The true-life story of deaf-and-blind Singaporean Theresa Chan crosses paths with three fictional vignettes in "Be With Me," a curate's egg of a movie that starts intriguingly but becomes increasingly frustrating. Fourth feature by Eric Khoo -- and his first solo outing since the 1997 "12 Storeys" which played in Cannes' Un Certain Regard -- shows the Singaporean writer-director still more of a small-scale mood painter than a real dramatist. Pic could have a career in festival situations, but, beyond special-issue screenings centered on Chan's handicaps, it looks like tough sledding on the arthouse circuit.
Film opens on an unseen person, only much later revealed to be Chan herself, typing a manuscript on an old manual typewriter. She types: "Is true love truly there, my love? Yes, if your warm heart is" -- setting up the three fictional stories about characters looking for love in a rather emotionally bleak world.
First up is the story of an old shopkeeper (Chiew Sung-ching) who patiently cooks food to take to his sick wife in the hospital. Toned-down color and fixed camera set-ups establish a slowish, but not enervating, style which is considerably more accessible than in Khoo's previous features (including his first, "Mee Pok Man").
Adrian Tan's clean compositions draw considerable strength from Chiew's sad-sack face and his portrayal of quiet, loving dedication.
Gradually intercut is the much livelier yarn of Sam (Samantha Tan), an average middle-class Singaporean teen addicted to text-messaging and her computer, who finds a soul mate in a chat room. In an nice twist, when they finally meet, Sam's soul mate turns out to be female -- fellow teen Jackie (Ezann Lee) -- and the pair starts a clandestine lesbian relationship, depicted in a girly and (to non-Asian eyes) distinctly Hallmark style.
Third strand centers on a security guard, Fatty Koh (Seet Keng-yew), who's equally addicted to high-cholesterol food and a beautiful young yuppie, Ann (Lynn Poh), who works in his building. Fatty stalks Ann by foot and with security cameras, finally getting up the nerve to pen her a love letter, which he spends most of the movie laboriously writing in Chinese with the help of a dictionary.
Meanwhile, Sam finds herself shut out of Jackie's affections when the latter starts dating Brian (Jason Tan). Though the somewhat kittenish Jackie tries to patch things up, Sam gradually retreats into a lovesick depression.
First half of the movie has a simple, largely unaffected charm that's often engaging -- a lighter version of Khoo's previous two solo features but without their sardonic critique of Singapore's sterile society.
Main problems start at the halfway mark, when the elderly Chan's own story takes center stage and her real-life history (going deaf at 12, then blind at 14, from meningitis) is told through extensive subtitles and docu-like scenes of daily chores.
Cantonese Chan, who taught herself English only after becoming handicapped, speaks with a mechanical-sounding voice that's virtually impossible to understand without subtitles. That, and the sudden shoehorning of what is effectively a mini handicapped docu into a fictional structure, throws the movie for a dramatic loop just when the viewer is primed for some development of the earlier stories.
Script finally knits the various vignettes together, largely through a series of convenient coincidences. But only one linkage -- that between the old shopkeeper and Chan herself -- has any real emotional payoff. Fatty and Sam's stories suffer the most.
Performances are fine within their dramatic limitations -- there's scarcely five minutes' dialogue in the whole movie -- and warm scoring by Kevin Mathews and Christine Sham is a major assist in rolling things along. But at the end of the day, pic's awkward combo of true life and fiction doesn't really work in a dramatically cohesive way, despite incidental pleasures and character vignettes.
Transfer from HD to 35mm is virtually unnoticeable.

Atentative Singaporean film that mixes documentary fact and scripted fiction in a way that's become terribly hip on the festival circuit, Be With Me  is a lovelorn fugue between four tales of loss. The central figure is the Helen Keller ish Theresa Chan , an elderly deaf-blind woman (playing, or being, herself), whose published autobiography inspired director Eric Khoo 's concentric narratives. Which we receive in near-silent dribs, a flash or fragment at a time: An aged shopkeeper nurses his bedridden wife with carefully prepared cuisine, a text-message-addicted girl links up with a chatroom mystery girl and embarks on a fated gay affair, and an obese security guard stalks a svelte yuppie. Khoo's strategy is all mood and no drama, veering close to sentimental shortcuts even before Chan and the inspiring details of her daily life take over the film and subtly invade its fictional world. Sometimes clumsy and dry, always sympathetic, and wryly interested in the impact food has on social intercourse, Be With Me  is eventually affecting once its elliptical shape becomes clear.
