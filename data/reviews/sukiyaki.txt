 “Sukiyaki Western Django,” the latest offering from the protean and prolific Japanese director Takashi Miike, is a feast for genre fetishists, a loving and lurid pastiche of the spaghetti westerns that were themselves lurid pastiches of classic Hollywood cowboy pictures. It is fitting that the honorary master of ceremonies at this film-geek orgy is Quentin Tarantino, dean of the international film-geek fraternity, who elegantly disembowels a snake in the opening scene and who appears later to fill in some plot holes and speak in bizarrely accented English.  His manner of speech is no stranger than anyone else’s in the movie, but it is perhaps a little more puzzling, since nearly everyone else in the movie is a Japanese actor speaking in a stylized version of the idiom of the Old West. Mr. Tarantino for his part sounds like a samurai from Texas. Or something.  Not that linguistic authenticity, or any other kind, has anything to do with “Sukiyaki Western Django,” the gleeful cosmopolitanism of which is summed up in its jazzy, nonsensical title. The original spaghetti-slingers dubbed English dialogue into the mouths of their international casts, and Mr. Miike has taken the further step of allowing his performers, in effect, to dub themselves into English.  Their sometimes awkward readings — of lines like “Don’t you reckon we’d better high-tail it?” — emphasize the  demented artificiality of the movie, which concerns a feud, hidden treasure and a gunslinger who comes to town for money and sticks around to see that justice prevails. An acknowledged source is Sergio Corbucci’s “Django,” a raw, ripe 1966 Italian western, but there are also references to Shakespeare’s “Henry VI,” Rambo and plenty of other high-  and low-cultural touchstones.  The run-down local saloon, you may notice, is called Eastwood’s, and the hero (Hideaki Ito), a taciturn marksman with no name, is a campier, less haunting cousin of the many gaunt and solitary riders Clint Eastwood has played over the years. This lone avenger strolls into a desolate mountain town to find the place gripped by a feud between the Genji, who dress in white, and their red-clad rivals, the Heiki. In the middle are two women (Yoshino Kimura and Kaori Momoi), the mother and grandmother of a small boy whose mixed heritage is symbolized by the red-and-white roses growing on his father’s grave.  Those flowers are one of a few lyrical touches in an otherwise  grindingly violent film. That the violence is often treated as sanguinary slapstick is not a problem in itself; turning mayhem into a joke is an expected feature of the self-conscious genre-blending formula Mr. Miike follows here. And some of the gags, notably the contortions of Teruyuki Kagawa, who plays the hapless, unreliable and all-but-indestructible sheriff, are gruesomely funny. But more often there is a frantic, compulsive quality to the action. Fanboy intoxication with the idea of formal ingenuity too often stands in for the thing itself.  For a while the weird color scheme and the tongue-in-cheek evocation of various traditions of popular cinema are amusing. But long before the final blood bath arrives the movie has made its point, which is essentially that Mr. Miike has a lot of energy and an extensive collection of DVDs.  “Sukiyaki Western Django” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for extreme violence.

Japanese maverick Takeshi Miike has one of his wildest ideas yet -- and that's saying something -- in "Sukiyaki Western Django," a Nipponese oater based on a spaghetti-Western ripoff of a samurai movie and performed entirely in subtitled, heavily Japanese-accented English. Plus, natch, Quentin Tarantino in a cameo. Basic joke wears off after five minutes, and many bystanders will start to head out of town. But genre/Asian buffs prepared to ride shotgun for two hours will be rewarded with some classy action sequences and densely accoutred widescreen lensing that create a distinctive Miike universe between the dialogue downtime. Immediate cult status beckons.
Best sequence is the prologue, with Tarantino (in a luridly colored desert-ranch set) playing gunslinger Piringo. After doing some spectacular things with a gun, a hawk and a snake, poncho-wearing Piringo tells the story of the (red-clad) Heike and (white-clad) Genji clans, who clashed at the legendary Battle of Dannoura in 1185. Half the joke is that Piringo speaks English like a cross between Toshiro Mifune and Takakura Ken; the other half is that it's Tarantino having a rocking good time.
Main yarn is set "several hundred years after the Battle of Dannoura" -- the late 1880s, if some gravestones are to be believed -- in the small, dust-blown town of Yuta, Nebada (Japanese does not have the "v" sound). Looking like a spaghetti-Western set crossed with a samurai movie, Yuta is ruled by both the Heike, led by mad, volatile Kiyomori (Koichi Sato), and the Genji, led by epicene, cool-headed Yoshitsune (Yusuke Iseya, grabbing most of the acting honors). Both clans have been lured by the promise of gold in them thar hills.
Into town rides a nameless gunslinger in black (Hideaki Ito), who takes a liking to a half-Heike, half-Genji kid, Heihachi (Ruka Uchida), whose father Akira (Shun Oguri) was killed by Kiyomori. Heihachi's grandmother, Ruriko (vet Kaori Momoi, clearly having fun), runs the general store and hides a colorful past as a female gunslinger; his mother, Shizuka (Yoshino Kimura), is Yoshitsune's lover and a dancer in the Genji-run saloon. Both women vow vengeance against the Heike.
Plot pretty much follows the outline of "A Fistful of Dollars" (which in turn was based on "Yojimbo"), down to the gunslinger trying to play both sides against each other and later getting beaten to a pulp prior to the final high-street showdown. Script by Miike and Masaru Nakamura ("Dororu," plus many Miike pics) adds in plenty of diversions -- including tinted flashbacks to explain the characters' histories, some fun with a Gatling gun that seems lifted from "Duck, You Sucker!" and a finale in which Ruriko takes part, all guns blazing. But "Fistful" remains the lodestone.
Though the subtitled, stilted English quickly loses its freshness, the fractured line delivery becomes almost unnoticeable after a while, and pic gradually creates its own atmosphere. Only Teruyuki Kagawa's shtick as the opportunistic sheriff grates, and could easily be cut, along with several overlong dialogue scenes. With 20 minutes taken out, "Sukiyaki" would be more palatable to wider auds without losing much.
Final showdown is neatly staged; ditto coda, with Miike's usual mix of cartoony violence larded with moments of real savagery and underpinned by a melancholy romanticism.
Production shows no signs of haste, with mobile cutting by Taiji Shimamura. Koji Endo's score tips its hat to Ennio Morricone but, like the film itself, has its own character. Fusion production design by Takashi Sasaki, who worked on the Japanese set of "Kill Bill," and cleverly cross-cultural costumes by Michiko Kitamura give pic a substantial look and feel.

Whether it's score-settling culture theft, a fever dream of interlinked Wild West mythology, or simply a company casserole of way-cool cinema, this delirious spaghetti eastern could only have come from the boiling brain of Takashi Miike , the prolific Japanese auteur whose spectacularly uneven films account for the lion's share of the past decade's most utterly batshit movie moments. His quota increases exponentially with this Yojimbo /A Fistful of Dollars  riff about an ace gunslinger (Hideaki Ito ) caught between color-coded clans in a suspiciously Nipponese Nevada town, where samurai swords and post-apocalyptic costumes vie for dominance with Gatling guns and cowboy suits. Delivered entirely in phonetic English for unneeded additional derangement, the garbled, woozily re-created dialogue adds another layer of movie fetishism to the whirling duster coats, blazing six-guns, and Mexican stand-offs cribbed from Sergios Leone  and Corbucci. The director also borrows favorite tropes from sources as far-rangingas Rambo   and Sam Raimi 's The Quick and the Dead , enlisting no less a fellow magpie than Quentin Tarantino  in the Pai Mei  role of special-guest gunfighter. (Pointing that can-opener jaw and speaking in tongues, he sounds like Elvis  on an udon binge.) And yet the absurdist bloodshed, anime-to-painted-backdrop stylization, and jarring tone shifts belong to no other director, and so too the stretches of tedium between outrages. Still, the widescreen framing and saturated color make this one of Miike's most visually impressive features.
