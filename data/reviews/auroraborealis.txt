On paper, Dawson's Creek 's Joshua Jackson and Natural Born Killers ' Juliette Lewis are an unlikely romantic combo. Aurora Borealis  is a piffling indie drama about a Minneapolis guy with an ailing grandpa and the effervescent home aide who tries to snap him out of his local rut, but somehow, Jackson and Lewis are paired persuasively. Lewis, in particular, is a charmer; it's a loss that she never became an A-lister. And Jackson is, as always, earnestness itself. The movie would be a quality guilty-gloopy pleasure if it weren't so deadly overlong.

 “Aurora Borealis” stars Joshua Jackson as Duncan, a boring, damaged, apathetic 20-something whose major claim on our attention is the type of bathetic cuddliness perfected by wet puppies and Mark Ruffalo. The fixation of independent movies on the arrested development of bourgeois dullards may have less to do with the relevance of the topic than the class of people who get to make movies. Whatever the case, James Burke directs from a screenplay by Brent Boyd.  Set in dead-of-winter Minneapolis, a ready-made metaphor for (groan, shiver) the chill in Duncan’s heart, the movie tells how life warms up when he goes to work at a nursing home. He takes the gig because hey, why not, and also so the filmmakers can place him in proximity to his crusty grandfather (Donald Sutherland). But the spark comes from connecting with Kate, a free-spirited nurse played with live-wire attention by Juliette Lewis.  Ms. Lewis excels as sexpots (“Natural Born Killers”) and psychopaths (“Natural Born Killers”) and, in her capacity as the lead singer of a rock band, she has mastered the art of crowd surfing in a bikini, but “Aurora Borealis” hints at an untapped talent for playing mature, textured women. Kate is spry, avid, generous and autonomous. You don’t doubt her galvanic effect on Duncan; you only wonder why she, and this film, care about him in the first place.  “Aurora Borealis” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language.

The thawing of a snow-bound young man's aimless existence is the heavily applied metaphor in "Aurora Borealis." Alternately breezy and pro-found, pic hits enough emo-tional chords to connect with auds, which will be charmed by a newly mature Joshua Jackson, a deeply aged Donald Suther-land and a friskily romantic Juliette Lewis. This reps a solid item for mid-level fests and will offer warmer returns in ancil-lary than in cool theatrical venues.
Resistant toward any real job, 25-year-old Minneapolis native Duncan (Jackson) resembles a Kevin Smith character shuffling through life, demanding little of himself and expecting little in return. His slackerdom is under-lined by occasional clashes with corporate-driven bro Jacob (Ste-ven Pasquale).
Director James Burke, with writer Brent Boyd, admirably retreat from judging their charac-ters, an attitude that's especially helpful in Duncan's case. The sudden need to help his ill grand-father Ronald (Sutherland) -- who's more than grandmother Ruth (Louise Fletcher) can handle most of the time -- serves the rather elementary dramatic pur-pose of forcing Duncan to behave like an adult.
With multiple afflictions, Ronald is every elderly aud member's worst nightmare. Duncan makes the giant step (for him) of landing a handyman's job in his grandpar-ent's building so he can be close to them. Too obviously entering as Duncan's future love interest, home nurse Kate (Lewis) is hired as a therapist for Ronald and,  meeting Duncan in his most empa-thetic mode, it's charm at first sight.
Pic goes through the rather predictable hoops until  the pair discovers their rather stark dif-ferences. Latter element is over-played with dialogue insistently noting that while Duncan has never lived anywhere beyond Minneapolis' city limits, Kate hardly stays in one city long enough to get a b.f.
Easing viewers over the lumpy mid-section and through the predictable third act is the un-abashed good nature of Jackson and Lewis, both of whom have rarely been so enjoyably charis-matic. Going against his WB-engendered cocky persona, Jack-son stresses Duncan's vulnerabili-ties thereby centering the film emotionally. Lewis winningly plays it straight.
Sutherland may ham it up a tad as an old codger with shaky hands, but he does it with theatrical flair that works to his sad character's advantage. Fletcher is a rather marginal participant amidst the good thesping.
Even compared to the Coen Brothers, Minnesota has rarely felt as Arctic as it does here, all the more impressive for the mas-sive amounts of artificial white stuff production had to haul in for Alar Kivilo's fine lensing of plenti-ful midwinter sequences. Usually estimable composer Mychael Danna contributes one of his least inspired scores. Pic would be boosted by some trims, especially in second act.

Because they apparently couldn't wait until the next Ed Burns  movie, first-time feature director James Burke  and screenwriter Brent Boyd  have conspired to give us their own cinematic paean to the comforts of home and the virtues of hanging out with "the guys" instead of going out into the world and making something of your life. In a nicely measured performance, Dawson's Creek heartthrob Joshua Jackson  plays the rudderless Duncan, who works as a handyman in a Minnesota apartment building and falls for the free-spirited nurse (sexy-kooky Juliette Lewis ) who tends to his Parkinson's-afflicted grandfather (scenery-inhaling Donald Sutherland ). The legacy of a dead father looms large, thickly accented Midwesterners offer pearls of country wisdom that usually begin with "In my day," and the question of whether Duncan will follow his lady love out to the California coast fails to generate edge-of-your-seat suspense. Aurora Borealis ulth yes, that title eventually comes home to roostdoesn't offend in any way, but it's so self-consciously quaint, so unwaveringly "nice," that you nearly wish it did.
