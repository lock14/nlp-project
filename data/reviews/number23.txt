The only fright in the nominal thriller "The Number 23" is how shaggy, gaunt, and wiped out Jim Carrey looks. Standing around in too many scenes wearing a white tank top, with tattoos on his back and a saxophone in his hands, he could be auditioning for a film about Iggy Pop's unknown jazz years.
Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, a dogcatcher who suffers from "graphomania" and numerological compulsion. This means he spends the whole movie keyed up over the number 23, scribbling equations and formulas everywhere, including on his own body and his own home. Alas, the writing is quite literally on the wall, and it's complete gibberish.
Walter narrates the events that transpire after his all-too-patient wife, a baker named Agatha (Virginia Madsen), introduces him to the James M. Cain-lite "novel of obsession" that shares its title with the movie. The pedestrian, vaguely queasy prose ("You can call me Fingerling") obsesses both the dogcatcher and director Joel Schumacher, who gives us gauzy reenactments of the book's pulpy, noirish doings.
They feature Walter as the detective, Fingerling, investigating murder and more, and Agatha in a black wig playing a whorish Italian named Fabrizia. Whorishness being this book's stock in trade, there's another sexpot (Lynn Collins). She exposes the detective (I can't type that name again) to her own paranoia over the number 23.
She's called Suicide Blonde, like the old hit INXS song, only you can't dance to her. Indeed, the names in this film seem to be a parody of symbolism. A case in point: Walter's teen son is called Robin Sparrow.
For Walter, the book's numeric paranoia is contagious, and he can't stop 23-ing. The movie follows crazily along, delivering psychopathology reminiscent of "The Shining," montages straight out of recent bargain-basement horror, not to mention a random shot of "Dogs Playing Poker." (If you're truly interested in the cinema of numeric affliction and writing on the body, skip this movie and try the films of Peter Greenaway.)
It's depressing to see Carrey go in so deeply for this sort of claptrap the way he does in the preposterous climax, which is like an unwelcome riff on sequences from "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind." Incidentally, "23" does inspire longing for the memory-purging services in that movie.
First-time screenwriter Fernley Phillips is the mind behind this thriller. And his script seems to have sprung from the same writer's workshop that gave us last year's "Stranger Than Fiction," which also featured a paranoid sap, the lady baker in his life, a work of dubious literature, some unconvincing analysis of said literature, the bogus use of a musical instrument as a prop, an anonymous urban setting, and several aggravating ideas about destiny as culminating in the rush on an oncoming city bus.
"The Number 23" is the sleazier movie. But the lurid is all that really seems to interest Schumacher anymore. He's never been much of a filmmaker, and "23" has no real rhythm or suspense. Like a bad music video (which is to say like most of Schumacher's movies), the whole thing is production design and runaway editing. Yet his prolific career has lasted three decades.
Focused on a sort of pop youth movie, he gave us his best stuff in the 1980s and very early '90s ("St. Elmo's Fire," "The Lost Boys," "Flatliners") but never outgrew the slickness of that era, refusing to put his style to any penetrating use. So nearly everything he touched -- "Batman Forever," "Batman & Robin," "8MM," "Flawless," "Bad Company," "Phone Booth," "The Phantom of the Opera" -- turned to schlock.
Schlock can be fun, just not here. "23" is like spending more than 90 minutes watching somebody else complete a Sudoku puzzle. I know what you're thinking: No Sudoku puzzle should take more than 90 minutes!


         In a chilling TV commercial that's been airing for a home security system, a mother snaps a photo of her two ballerina daughters. When she glances down at the viewfinder, she sees a man's face in the darkened window behind them. That 30-second spot has more scares in it than the entirety of the ridiculously inept thriller "The Number 23."
 
  Written by newcomer Fernley Phillips and directed by veteran Joel Schumacher, the movie stars Jim Carrey as Walter Sparrow, an animal-control officer who goes off the deep end after being bitten by a spooky dog named Ned and reading an odd novel found in a used-book store by his wife, Agatha (Virginia Madsen in the lesser of her two supporting wife roles for the week).
 


         






    The crudely self-published tome, called "The Number 23," details the dark doings of a gumshoe named Fingerling who falls victim to a homicidal obsession with the eponymous digits of the book's title.
 
  Sparrow (apparently no relation to Jack) begins to see connections between his life and the mysterious book and becomes likewise fixated with the 2-3.
 
  It's a Stephen King-like scenario and if handled with a little nuance might have made for a nice, scary ride. Instead, the filmmakers get it all wrong from the get-go. Everyone seems to be approaching the material from a different direction with unintentional humor seeping in from all angles.
 
  The story is maddeningly convoluted, and for the little narrative logic that eventually emerges, it might as well have been improvised. Every twist and turn — none of which really adds up in the end — appear to exist strictly for the sake of plot with no thought given to character motivation.
 
  Why, for instance, does it take Sparrow almost a week to read this relatively slim book that he's supposedly obsessed with other than to allow the story to stretch out to numeric dates that fulfill some harebrained apophenia — the experience of seeing patterns or connections in random or meaningless data.
 
  Carrey has never looked so uncomfortable on-screen. As Sparrow, he's neutered with about as much personality as a fireplug. He fares a little better in the fantasy sequences as Fingerling, with his slicked-back hair and bad boy tattoos, though those sequences feel like such self-parody that the character comes across as some wrong-side-of-the-tracks cousin of Ace Ventura.
 
  Poor Schumacher throws a dizzying array of stylistics at the screen to no avail. Based on the number of inadvertent laughs the movie gets — I'd say it's way more than 23 — New Line might have been better off repackaging it as a comedy.
 
  How bad is "The Number 23"? It gives "Batman & Robin" a run for its money as the worst of the director's long career.
 
  When Sparrow initially spurns Agatha's offer to let him read the book, he says, "And have some writer fill my head with nonsense? I'll wait for the movie."
 
  Frankly, I'd skip the movie as well.
 

 
  "The Number 23." MPAA rating: R for violence, disturbing images, sexuality and language. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes. In general release.   

These days, when I think of Jim Carrey, I don't envision a performer who automatically longs to be funny. I think of an actor who is frictionless and elastic, who has the slightly detached, quicksilver quality of a talk-show host trying to work up a moment of ''sincerity.'' In his straight roles (it feels wrong, with Carrey, to use a word like serious ), his eagerness to please becomes the most prominent thing about him, and he can seem ineffectual, with those pleading eyes and that gawking jaw  a nerd parading himself, for no good reason, with the lightness of a clown.
For a while, as I watched him in The Number 23 , Joel Schumacher's glossy ''dark'' thriller about murder, numerology, and, you know, what's ''real,'' I experienced the awkwardness I have so often felt, at movies like The Majestic  or the remake of Fun With Dick and Jane , when a Jim Carrey ordinary-guy performance isn't working. Tall and goosey, with a shock of hair that falls over his eyes (he now looks like a 45-year-old choirboy), Carrey plays Walter Sparrow, a sweet, mopey dogcatcher, married and with a teenage son. As a birthday gift from his wife (Virginia Madsen), Walter receives a handmade novel that looks as if it's been typed and pasted together by your basic, everyday paranoid schizophrenic conspiracy theorist. It's called The Number 23 , it was written by someone named Topsy Kretts, and it's full of coincidence? you decide!  hugger-mugger about the number 23. The movie's official press kit offers such spooky examples of the ''23 enigma'' as ''Kurt Cobain died in 1994: 1+9+9+4 = 23.'' A little too much of this sort of thing, and you really could go crazy.
Let us put aside, for a moment, the book's sinister mysteries. Simply accepting Jim Carrey as an average husband and parent requires a backflip of suspended disbelief. Yet it's one that a lot of audiences may find they want to take, if only because Carrey, doing his first creepy-junky puzzle horror thriller, throws himself into blood-bucket acting with a commitment that's scary enough to hold you. (It isn't hard to see why: The man needs a hit.) As Walter reads the book, we see him imagine himself as the main character, a sexy, disheveled detective by the name of Fingerling. Think Carrey imitating Rick Springfield acting like Bogart in a moody cologne commercial. As we watch, Fingerling, with his stubbled scowl, his snaky tattoos, and  yes  a saxophone, plunges into a compulsive, back-clawing love affair with a dangerous siren (also played by Madsen). He also becomes fixated on the number 23, an obsession that spreads like a virus to Walter, who begins to see the number everywhere, adding together the digits of  this birthday or that address, only to end up, over and over again, with 23 (or 32  which, as he breathlessly proclaims, is ''23 in reverse!'').
Are you terrified yet? As Walter jabbers on about hidden numerological signs, we're only too aware that those numbers are as arbitrary in their patterns as the  script needs them to be. There are moments when I groaned, and giggled, at The Number 23 . Yet after a while, a compelling thing starts to happen. As Walter searches for the key to the book's code (is it a warning? a confession? both?), the stylized, overeager quality of Carrey's acting  the very fragility of his impersonation of an average fellow  begins to work for the movie. When he points a knife at his wife, quivering like a madman because, just maybe, he's channeling the spirit of a killer, Carrey plays the moment with a conviction more startling, and genuine, than his typical aw-shucks sweetness. Walter's personality, as it turns out, truly is a conceit, a happy-face mask strapped over a soul of anxiety.
He moves into a flophouse, with rotten green light and stains on the walls, and he's drawn into the book's images  of a suicide, a student's affair with her professor, a bedroom murder  which become interlaced with his own nightmares. Is Walter being driven to commit a murder too? Schumacher parades these visions with a flash-cut trippiness that one remembers from movies like Jacob's Ladder  or The Butterfly Effect   thrillers gloppy with omens, overly drenched in ''mood.'' But the film's assaultive shock editing holds you, and so does its mystery, which is like The Da Vinci Code  with insanity and violence in place of highbrow signifiers. By the end, you'll want to stick around, if only to crack the Jim Carrey code: Is he a real actor after all, or is the rabid urgency with which he keeps trying  to be the most real thing about him?

 “The Number 23” is an accidental comedy starring a deadly serious Jim Carrey that owes something to David Fincher, a little something else to Robert Anton Wilson and next to nothing, at least intentionally, to the gods of laughter, be they Gelus (Greek) or Jerry Lewis (American). In its downbeat tone and paranoid timbre, the film recalls several of the director Joel Schumacher’s previous thrillers, notably “8MM,” his exploitative walk on the sexually deviant side. Like all his films this new one looks professionally polished; like “8MM” it’s humorless save when it’s laughable.  A master crafter of overwrought pulp fiction, Mr. Schumacher started in Hollywood as a costume designer before writing several black-oriented movies, including Michael Schultz’s memorable ensemble comedy “Car Wash.” He went on to direct slick amusements like “The Lost Boys” and “Flatliners,” all as disreputable as they are diverting, along with the even better “Falling Down” (Michael Douglas goes ballistic as a beleaguered Los Angeles Everyman) and “Phone Booth” (Colin Farrell gets hung up in the last phone booth in New York). He also brought the “Batman” franchise to a temporary halt with “Batman & Robin”  (the one in which George Clooney wears a rubber suit with assertively stiff nipples), but that film paved the way for Christopher Nolan’s “Batman Begins,” so who’s complaining?  No matter how preposterous, Mr. Schumacher’s films almost always have a certain pop je ne sais quoi; they’re hooky like a chart-topping song, like that not-quite-dumb-enough television show you just can’t stop watching. “The Number 23,” which was written by the newcomer Fernley Phillips, starts off promisingly with Mr.  Carrey, eyeballing a dog from behind the wheel of a truck. The character, the curiously named Walter Sparrow, works as a dogcatcher in Anywhere U.S.A., a job that might be a tip of the hat to Mr. Carrey’s breakout role in “Ace Ventura: Pet Detective” and definitely comes off as a bit down- market for a leading man in a Hollywood flick. That alpha-dog entrance suggests Walter is a wee eccentric.  The story doesn’t make a doggy lick of sense, which isn’t a knock. Walter’s wife, Agatha (Virginia Madsen), buys him a used book, “The Number 23,” written by someone waggishly called Topsy Kretts. If that name doesn’t tip you off that something is afoot (say the two words fast if you’re still missing the joke), then Walter’s sudden preoccupation with the book should do the trick. Before you can say “obsessive-compulsive disorder” or look up apophenia (the experience of seeing connections where none exist), Walter finds himself seeing the number 23 in every combination everywhere he turns: indoors and out, on street signs and in his personal history, name and anniversaries. It all adds up, even if it doesn’t.  What does it mean? Not much, though the film spends a lot of our time and its energy trying to persuade us otherwise. Mr. Schumacher has some fun with special effects, taking us inside the gloomy neo-noir world of the book itself, where Mr. Carrey plays another character with an animal-related moniker, Fingerling. The word Fingerling means small fish, but he comes across as small potatoes. A detective by trade, he plays the sax, fools around with a femme fatale named Fabrizia (Ms. Madsen, slinking around in dark hair and black slip), and hooks up with a woman he anoints the Suicide Blonde (Lynn Collins). Naturally he employs a wrung-out voice-over, suggesting that he or the screenwriter has lapped up one too many detective stories.  Speaking of pattern recognition: Mr. Phillips has admitted to reading Robert Anton Wilson, who, along with Robert J. Shea, wrote the cult favorite “The Illuminatus! Trilogy,” a series of three novels that fold conspiracy theories in with a detective pastiche and science fiction, and helped popularize the notion that the number 23 is somehow meaningful, an idea that may have originated with the cosmic joke qua pseudoreligion Discordianism. (The name Walter Sparrow evokes one of Mr. Wilson’s characters, Hugh Crane.) The popularity of the books with some readers can be gauged by the Web sites dedicated to the number 23 (“The 23 Enigma Explained!!”),  one of which (lostpedia.com/wiki/23) is exclusively dedicated to its various and significant occurrences on the television show “Lost.”  Despite the fast-flying digits, the numbers finally feel irrelevant to the film’s riffs on crime and punishment. The Fingerling story evidently entertains Mr. Schumacher, who darkens the already somber palette to accentuate the shadows and play up the nominal mystery, but his heavy hand soon helps push the material into lugubrious self-parody. This might be fine — certainly it produces welcome laughs, especially toward the finale — if Mr. Carrey appeared to be in on the joke. Alas, this great comic talent seems to think he’s fronting a serious film, an assignment for which he has reined in his body, trading his ductile physicality and natural grace for moody stares and anguished postures that, in all likelihood, will soon be mirrored by even his more adamant fans in the audience.  “The Number 23” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has adult language, scenes of animal endangerment, and one realistic-looking slit and spurting human throat.

Gimmicky numerology plus Jim Carrey minus narrative coherence equals "The Number 23," a visually and psychologically murky thriller that, given its hero's paranoid obsession with the titular number, plays like a very grungy episode of "Sesame Street." Noirish fantasy sequences and red herrings galore fail to enliven this straight-faced but silly exercise from helmer Joel Schumacher, while the prospect of Carrey in downbeat thriller mode promises to intrigue as many potential audiences as it turns off, equating to likely midrange numbers at the box office.
Fernley Phillips' first produced screenplay is structured around the "23 enigma," which states that all significant events, names, dates and times are somehow connected to the number 23. Witness the historical evidence: Julius Caesar was stabbed 23 times; Shakespeare was born on April 23, 1564, and died on April 23, 1616; and the Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, and obviously, 4+1+5+1+9+1+2=23. (Of course, by the same logic, Shakespeare's date of birth adds up to 25, but never mind.)
The phenomenon begins to haunt middle-aged dog catcher Walter Sparrow (Carrey) soon after his wife (Virginia Madsen), tellingly named Agatha, gives him a mystery novel bearing the same title as the film. As he reads the book, creepily narrated by a detective named Fingerling (also played by Carrey), Walter realizes he and the protagonist have an unsettling number of things in common. And like Fingerling, Walter concludes that everything in his life -- from his birthday to his social security number -- is overshadowed by the dreaded 23.
The book-within-a-movie unfolds in a series of stylized neo-noir tableaus, soaked in Carrey's vaguely Philip Marlowe-esque voiceover, as Fingerling murders his black-wigged moll Fabrizia (also Madsen) in a jealous rage and frames her lover (Danny Huston, unctuous as ever) for the crime.
Life all too quickly imitates art, and Walterstarts having dark visions of stabbing his wife, while their close friend Isaac (Huston again) hovers semi-lecherously in the background. Script compounds its mysteries by adding a dead woman, an ominous dog and enough wacko higher-level math to make auds feel like they're trapped in a numerology seminar.
Eventually Walter gets a grip and, with Agatha and their son Robin (Logan Lerman), sets out to discover who the book's author is and why he's playing all these sinister mind games. As the revelation nears, Phillips' self-consciously twisty screenplay repeatedly favors cleverness at the expense of clarity, and it remains too enamored of its central gimmick to mutate persuasively into either a probing psychological study or, later, a moving family drama.
Worse still, Schumacher (returning to contempo thrillers after "The Phantom of the Opera") never finds the requisite visual strategy to convincingly render the film's parallel worlds. The scenes from the novel contain some striking images, including one room that's flooded in futuristic white, as well as generally more off-kilter compositions, but the film's dreamlike dissolves repeatedly undercut any kind of suspenseful rhythm.
As he proved most recently in "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" (which plumbed the depths of his subconscious much more inventively), Carrey has gifts far beyond the range of dumb comedy; here, however, he's simply miscast in a role that would have benefited from a lesser-known character thesp. Wearing his hair uncharacteristically long, the actor seems wrong for the role of a husband and father from the start, although later twists do shed some light on why this might be the case.
Still, neither Walter nor Fingerling makes a very compelling central figure, and Carrey's need to imbue the former with a darkly humorous streak is distractingly palpable. Madsen is OK as Walter's wife and rather less so as the trampy Fabrizia, suggesting, as did "Firewall," that the gifted actress may want to avoid supporting-spouse roles in her post-"Sideways" career.
Pic's overall look is deliberately drab and cheerless, relying heavily on grubby greens and browns, although the color red recurs throughout as a bold if obvious motif. For the record, Ted Bundy was executed on Jan. 24, 1989, not Jan. 23.

The Number 23  grips hold of one stupid idea and runs so far with it, in so many directions, to such little purpose, that it nearly won me over from sheer berserkoid effort. In a nutshell, this nutso movie observes what happens to a man (Jim Carrey ) under the impression that every damn thing that's happened in the history of the world somehow relates to the titular digitHiroshima , the death of Hitler , Grandma's birthday, whatever. Parents each contribute 23 chromosomes to their kids; the Earth's axis is off by 23.5 degrees (and 5 = 2 + 3); the Mayans predicted the apocalypse on December 23, 2012 (20 + 1 + 2 = 23); New Line Cinema  projects a $23 million opening weekend. Evidently, the secret principle of the universe comes down to six degrees of separation for algebra nerds. (And 6 = 2 x 3!)
There's something sort of adorable about a thriller premised on the delusional analysis of utter randomness, and I salute its makers for extending this helter-skelter desperation to everything in the movieplot, character, logic, continuity, production design, cinematography. If nothing else, they're consistently arbitrary.
The plot is beyond complicated, but it basically comes down to this: Omigod, 23! Omigod, 23!! Omigod, 23!!! Yet, for all its relentless number-crunching, this is really a movie about story-telling, and stories within stories, and stories within flashbacks within fantasies within madnessall of it unloaded with the help of exposition so preposterously contrived it borders on parody. Director Joel Schumacher  appears to take things very seriously, but there's a sense that screenwriter Fernley Phillips  is winking up from the page and having a bit of fun with the idea that deranged paranoia is a form of authorship and vice versa, each being motivated by a impulse to pattern-making, a compulsion to arrange connections that don't naturally exist.
Carrey stars as Walter Sparrow , mild-mannered factotum of the local Animal Control. From the look of things, he appears to have a muskrat living on his head, but crisis of coif notwithstanding, his immediate concern is a runaway dog growling in the alley of a Chinese take-out joint. Any veterinarianor veteran of corny supernatural thrillerscould identify the breed as Benevolent Totem crossed with Guardian of the Dead, but Walter remains oblivious even as the pooch leads him to a gravestone and sits patiently with a Meaningful Stare.
In any event, the dog detour makes him late for a date with his wife Agatha (Virginia Madsen ), who's passed the time at a bookshop flipping though the ratty red covers of The Number 23 . Encouraged perhaps by the hilariously blatant red color scheme of the movie she's in, Agatha purchases the mysterious, self-published tome for her hubby. "Have some writer fill my head with nonsense?" says he. "I'll wait for the movie." Ha! Ends up the book is, like, the story of Walter's life and everything! Cue a cut-rate film noir that Walter imagines as he pursues the text, starring himself as a hard-boiled detective with an uncanny resemblance to Gaius Baltar from Battlestar Galactica   and his wife as a femme fatale with a less-than-magnificent ability to navigate in stilettos.
This interior film is beyond complicated, but it basically comes down to: Omigod, 23! + killing. That's how The Number 23  goes from being a film about diabolical literature and hysterical numerology to a murder mystery that has something to do with a certain Dr. Sirius Leary. But seriously, could this film please be a little more off its rocker? A word of warning to fans of Dreamcatcher, Silent Hill , and Domino guilty pleasures with a similar devotion to throwing themselves off the cliff of credibility The Number 23 is a lot more fun to write about than sit through. That said, cultists will note that this review is appearing in The Village Voice  , a publication with 15 letters to its name. 1 + 5 = 6, and 6 = 2 x 3. Omigod!
