I don't know the first thing about first-time writer Adam Sztykiel, but it's easy enough to imagine your average struggling screenwriter holed up in his apartment, bouncing a red rubber ball off the wall, and trying to come up with that killer idea that will get him out of debt and into celebrity sit-downs at the Chateau Marmont. And then � eureka: Made of Honor
. "Get it? It's like 'maid of honor' � only with a dude playing the bridesmaid � and he's in love with the bride, who's his best friend, so it's like his best friend's wedding
. This thing totally writes itself!" Well, writes itself into a lie. Dempsey (TV's Dr. McDreamy) plays Tom, a slick playboy who, having previously invented the "coffee collar," now passes his days playing pickup with the boys and picking up chicks at Starbucks � chicks he will then subject to a ruthless set of dating rules meant to maximize his weekly influx of sexual encounters and minimize any messy emotional involvement. Best friend Hannah (Monaghan) is the go-to for family functions, antiques shopping, and a certain handsiness that only boy-and-girl-best-friends-in-the-movies are allowed (activities include linking arms, kissing on the mouth, and suction-cupping together for a nice slow dance). Then Hannah takes a six-week working vacation to Scotland, and absence makes Tom's heart sit up and go, "Huh, maybe I should reconsider the rules with my superhot best friend, who puts up with my preening and caddishness and emotional paralysis." Then Hannah returns home with a fianc� named Colin (McKidd) and a Highlands wedding to plan (hello, travel-porn shots of Scottish vistas). The script can veer from mean-spirited to uncomfortably blue (case in point: Sydney "Easy Paycheck" Pollack's prenup negotiation for a weekly "BJ"), making for a tonal discordance all the more disappointing considering co-writers and husband-and-wife team Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan got just the right read on mixing raunch with heart-on-the-sleeve sweets in Can't Hardly Wait
. But forget all that: What this really comes down to is the film's central lie. Made of Honor
 pins its hopes on a character who acts utterly without honor and on an actor who has only two settings � sensitive or smarmy. The smarm wins, and that half-smirk Dempsey wears throughout is not that of Prince Charming, but a prick.


I never thought it could happen, but I'm starting to miss Patrick Dempsey the Early Years. Remember him? The little pisher who starred in late-'80s comedies like "Loverboy" and "The Woo Woo Kid"? Back then, Dempsey was a jug-eared Jon Cryer-wannabe, likable and sharp but no one's idea of a dreamboat.
Now, of course, he's McDreamy - Dr. Derek Shepherd on the hit show "Grey's Anatomy" - and somewhere Jon Cryer is seething with envy. To shore up his new sex appeal, Dempsey's back in movies playing soulful Manhattan metrosexuals. Last year's "Enchanted" was a charmer. This year's "Made of Honor" is a retread - "My Best Friend's Wedding" with the genders reversed and the brains removed. Chick flicks this calculated should come with enough Scorpion Bowls to numb the pain.
As Tom, a wealthy New York ladies' man who goes shirtless every other scene, Dempsey struggles uphill against a fundamental flaw in the script: His character's a jerk. Having made millions right out of college by inventing coffee-cup collars, Tom has nothing to do all day but pick up models in Starbucks
 and play basketball with his testosterone-addled buddies (Kadeem Hardison plays the married, whipped, "sensitive" one).
Saving Tom from withering up and blowing away entirely is his longstanding friendship with Hannah (Michelle Monaghan), an art restorer and the movie's idea of a sensible Plain Jane. To put this over, the lovely Monaghan ("Kiss Kiss Bang Bang") has been lit and filmed as unattractively as possible. In some states, this would be considered a felony.
The two share Sundays and secrets together - they're a couple, only they don't know it. When Hannah travels to Scotland for six weeks, Tom misses her so badly he decides he must love her; to his dismay, she returns with a fiance, a hulking slab of Mr. Perfect named Colin (Kevin McKidd in the old Ralph Bellamy role). If Tom's a prince of the city, Colin's a duke. Of Scotland. With four castles - one for each season.
Once Hannah asks Tom to be her maid of honor, director Paul Weiland stops at every appointed comedy station: the dress fitting, the bridal shower, the lingerie shop. If you've seen the trailer, for all intents and purposes you've seen the movie. The name of the production company is Original Film, which in other circumstances - those in which Sara Bareilles's "Love Song" didn't play over the opening credits - would be hilarious.
Dempsey does give Tom interesting little fits of frustration as he tries to sabotage the nuptials and still be the best male maid of honor ever, and "Made of Honor" might let loose if he decided to go for all-out warfare or if he really delved into his feminine side. The movie's ultimately as passive-aggressive as its hero, though.
And after a while you start to notice the script's curious mean streak: the pathetic nerd (Kevin Sussman) who keeps horning in on the boys' basketball game; Tom's clammy-handed Internet stalker (Christine Barger); the bridesmaids who could be named Dumpy (Emily Nelson), Skinny (Whitney Cummings), and Psycho (Busy Philipps). Even the usually classy Sydney Pollack gives off crass fumes as Tom's much-married father. In "Made of Honor," the leads are beautiful and everyone else is a freak. So where does that leave us?


Imagine the ultimate chick-flick leading man. He's foxy and a bit dangerous, with merry dancing eyes and a way of caressing a barbed wisecrack just so. Patrick Dempsey   is not quite that guy. He looks good, but with a squinty gaze that doesn't radiate much light (he could be Sean Penn's stockbroker brother). He's sweet, steady, and likable, but someone to count on rather than someone to sweep you away. All of which makes him perfect as the steadfast best-friend-who's-really-a-romantic in Made of Honor .
When Tom (Dempsey) met Hannah (Michelle Monaghan), the two were at college, and they ended up as buddies. After 10 years of palling around (and, in Tom's case, sleeping around with sex bombs he treats nearly as badly as the movie does), he realizes that Hannah is the one for him. But she's gotten herself engaged  to a towering hunk of a Scotsman (Kevin McKidd) who's like Daniel Craig on steroids  and, as a postfeminist lark, she wants Tom to be her maid of honor. To win her over, he seizes upon the emasculating role, a process that starts out routinely but grows steadily funnier as the movie arrives in Scotland. (There are terrific running gags about brogues, ghastly Scottish cuisine, and DayGlo sex beads.) Made of Honor  is a nice cookie-cutter comedy, no more and no less, but Dempsey, with his relaxed charm, and Monaghan, with her soft and peachy sensual spark, rise to the challenge of making friendship look like the wellspring of true love.

 The romantic comedy “Made of Honor” adds tart satirical flavors to a cotton-candy formula without sabotaging the sugar rush. Directed by Paul Weiland (“City Slickers II”), it begins on a nasty note when Tom (Patrick Dempsey), the putative Mr. Right in this taming-of-the-rogue fable, is introduced as a college boy wearing a hideous Bill Clinton mask and drunkenly bellowing for his Monica at a Halloween bacchanal.  The movie then skips ahead 10 years to discover this obnoxious Lothario living high in New York City off the millions he has made from his invention of the paper-cup sleeve. When the latest bimbo to grace his bed wonders the morning after their hookup if she will see him that evening, he snaps: “I don’t do back-to-backs. Two nights in a row; I don’t do that.” He also lives by the 24-hour rule: Never call a date until a full day has passed.  The apple doesn’t fall far from the tree, as they say. Tom’s wealthy father (Sydney Pollack) has been married and divorced so many times that he can’t recall whether his new wife is his sixth or his seventh.  He is shown dressed up and heading toward the altar while frantically negotiating a pre-nup by cellphone with his bride-to-be, who circles the block in a limousine with her lawyer.  The only sign that Tom has a heart is his strictly platonic friendship with Hannah (Michelle Monaghan), a fresh-faced director of acquisitions at the Metropolitan Museum of Art whom he has known since college. The two are such good pals that when Hannah tells him she has to go to Scotland for six weeks, he whines, “How can I live without you?”  Hannah returns from Scotland aglow over her engagement to Colin (Kevin McKidd), a rich, handsome aristocrat with a brogue who galloped to her rescue when he spied her stranded in her car at a cattle crossing. Suddenly Tom realizes Hannah is the love of his life. But what can he do? He decides he should keep his mouth shut and strategize.  When Hannah asks him to be maid of honor at her wedding in one of Colin’s several castles (his family has one for each season), Tom agrees in the hope that he can demonstrate how much he loves her and win her back. That  many assume his role means Tom must be gay makes for some wan humor.  “Made of Honor” scrambles the plotlines of “My Best Friend’s Wedding” and “Sweet Home Alabama” and changes the locales. It has gorgeous picture-postcard views of Manhattan and the Scottish countryside. It also ups the fantasy quotient. Nowadays it’s not enough for the designated princess in a romantic comedy to have one Prince Charming. She must have two to choose from.  Ms. Monaghan is an endearing screen presence, but her character has no personality. The movie can’t begin to explain the unlikely friendship of Tom and Hannah, for there is no rhyme or reason to it. If she were as bright as she is supposed to be, she wouldn’t tolerate his churlish treatment of other women. But she doesn’t seem to notice.  Mr. Dempsey, who at 42 is too old for his role, does his best to infuse Tom with some boyish charm. Ms. Monaghan’s aura of fundamental niceness is the main reason that “Made of Honor” retains enough sweetness to satisfy the cotton-candy addicts. For true believers in fairy tales, no romantic fantasy is too extravagant if the heroine is a sweetheart. The rest of us can sit there and roll our eyes.  “Made of Honor” is rated  PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations and some strong language.

Like a shopworn wedding gown disguised with a new sash, �Made of Honor� feels recycled from top to bottom. That�s because it�s essentially a gender-swapped version of �My Best Friend�s Wedding,� the 1997 Julia Roberts megahit about a woman trying to sabotage her best pal�s nuptials once she realizes she�s in love with him. The undermining duties here fall to �Grey�s Anatomy� star Patrick Dempsey in a predictably familiar role, albeit one that should lure his female-dominated fan base. Theatrical honeymoon could be short, however, as McDreamy-obsessed fans and lonely singletons may prefer this romantic comedy as a chicks-night rental.
It�s the eternally optimistic unwed female population, of course, that explains Hollywood�s seemingly inexhaustible litany of wedding comedies. With a few notable exceptions, the formula is starting to resemble a dog-eared copy of Modern Bride lying around a nail salon: For every legitimately hilarious and male-friendly �Wedding Crashers,� there are a half-dozen anemic items like �The Wedding Date� and �The Wedding Planner.�
�Made of Honor,� alas, falls into that latter category. Scribes Adam Sztykiel, Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont have generated a setup in which Dempsey�s confirmed bachelor, Tom, is at first completely blind to the long-harbored affections of his best friend, Hannah (Michelle Monaghan).
An aggressively cute college-set prologue explains Tom and Hannah�s inauspicious first meeting. Mistaking Hannah for her roommate, a drunken Tom crawls into her bed, only to be doused with a bottle of perfume. She�s so appalled, she insists she wouldn�t sleep with Tom if he were the last man on earth. Flash forward 10 years: By now, they�re good pals.
If the film�s internal logic and implied chronology are to be believed, Tom would be about 31 for the remainder of the story -- a stretch, considering Dempsey is in fact a handsome but weathered 42. But plausibility and verisimilitude apparently weren�t high on �Made of Honor�s� guest list.
It�s not so far-fetched that Tom and Hannah should become close friends after that initial encounter, or that she, despite her better judgment, would develop feelings for this narcissistic Casanova. During their weekly lunches and strolls through Manhattan, Hannah chides Tom about his rigid dating code: no consecutive dates with the same girl, no commitments -- and certainly no marriage. By now a successful entrepreneur, Tom refuses to turn out like his father (Sydney Pollack), an irredeemable romantic on his sixth marriage.
When an extended work obligation summons Hannah to Scotland, Tom is astonished to discover how much he misses her. In a well-played scene that effectively mixes emotional awkwardness with physical pratfalls, Tom plans to reveal his feelings to Hannah -- only to learn she�s fallen hard for wealthy whiskey scion Colin (Kevin McKidd.) 
When Hannah asks Tom to be her maid of honor at her Scottish wedding just two weeks away, Tom senses his only chance to intervene. And while planning a massive overseas ceremony in 14 days would be virtually inconceivable even if you have more money than Melania Trump, it�s even harder to believe a manly guy like Tom would willingly brook the emasculating moniker �maid of honor.� (Many real-life brides who involve close male pals in their weddings use �attendant� or the more anatomically correct �best man� -- less kitschy than �maid of honor,� but of course, far less useful as a source of double entendre.)
It�s pretty easy to predict the story beats from here: Tom stumbles through his duties, repeatedly offends the other bridesmaids and finds his way to Scotland, where he�ll have to prove himself to Hannah if he has any chance with her. While helmer Paul Weiland maintains a grasp on the proceedings -- some of these scenes are fairly funny, and pic skimps on neither acting talent nor production values -- it�s hard not to feel that we�ve already been there and done that.
That�s particularly true for an actor of Dempsey�s caliber: At his best when negotiating the fine line between pathos and comedy, he should actively seek roles that demonstrate his range, as he certainly deserves a better starring vehicle than this jalopy.


In Made of Honor , Patrick Dempsey  plays a conveniently rich and willfully single serial "fornicator" slowly but surely domesticated by his unspoken love for longtime BFF Hannah  (Michelle Monaghan ), who's on her way to Scotland  to marry Mr. Right Now since Mr. Right's too chickenshit to say boo before her "I do." Which, come to think of it, not only sums up this movie, but more or less half the films in which Dempsey starred between 1987 and 2003, when he was scheduled to headline a Fox TV  series based on the film About a Boy , with Dempsey in the Hugh Grant  role of the conveniently rich and willfully single serial "fornicator" slowly but surely domesticated by his blah, blah, blah. And then, of course, there's the My Best Friend's Wedding  connection. Only the filmmakers and McDreamy have been so up-front about the resemblance between their offering and 1997's threesome that to acknowledge any further similarities would be playing right into their grubby paws. Director Paul Weiland  and the three (!) screenwriters it took to boil down thousands of bad movies into 101 minutes haven't provided this one with a single original thought; it should only entertain those still getting adjusted to the idea of talkies.
