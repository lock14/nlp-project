         What is the value of education, and how does it shape our understanding of the world? These are the questions posed by "The History Boys," based on the hit play by Alan Bennett, directed by Nicolas Hytner and starring the original National Theater cast. A lively and entertaining disquisition on the purpose and uses of knowledge in a world that cares less about scholarship than quantifiable results, "The History Boys" asks us to ponder the moral consequences of reducing education to a tool for personal advancement, positing history as the infinitely malleable interpretation of recent events.
 
  Set in a middle-class private boys' school in Yorkshire in the 1980s, "The History Boys" is the story of a group of seven friends who find themselves in the unlikely position of being strong candidates for Oxford and Cambridge at the same time. Though the school's pompous, results-obsessed headmaster (Clive Merrison) won't acknowledge it, the boys owe their success to the efforts of two teachers, the dedicated, methodical Mrs. Lintott (Frances de la Tour) and the flamboyant, romantic Hector (Richard Griffiths), who instills his seemingly unfocused lessons in French and literature with a sense of antic fun.
 


         






    At the beginning of their final year, during which the students will be coached to take their Oxbridge entrance exams, the headmaster brings in a flashy young teacher, Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore), newly graduated from Oxford and full of ideas on "teaching to the test." Whereas Hector's classes are free-associative and seemingly aimless, mixing high culture and low culture in a way that brings them alive, Irwin's approach is flashy and contrarian. Mrs. Lintott asks her students to consider history's omissions (she likens it at one point to the experience of women watching men mess things up); Irwin presents it as an intellectual game to be rigged in one's favor.
 
  The contrast between the Old Guard and the new represents the tension between romanticism and pragmatism, between the search for truth and beauty and the shaping of reality to suit one's needs. To the Oxbridge dons, the slick young Irwin insists, what will count is the spin the students can put on history, not their understanding of it.
 
  "Looking back, immediately behind us is dead ground," Irwin tells the boys. "We don't see it, and because we don't see it, there is no period so remote as the recent past. The historian's job is to anticipate what our perspective of that period will be."
 
  If it is the function of art, and in particular literature, to teach us how to be human, then Hector and Lintott's approach to teaching support this and counter Irwin's more glib and facile views. Hector's greatest fear is that the boys will see history and literature as dead objects instead of living expressions of who we are.
 
  This tension applies to the characters' personal lives as well. As played by the expansive, in every sense of the word, Griffiths, Hector's idealism verges on the ridiculous, a fact of which he's well aware. The impulsive Hector follows his (illegal) bliss without a thought to its consequences. Moore, by contrast, is taut and compact, and seems to expend an enormous amount of energy restraining his every natural impulse. Irwin's cynicism creates a sense of alienation that's palpable. The boys, meanwhile, radiate an energy, optimism and soulfulness that spills into every aspect of the movie.
 
  Both teachers find themselves in love with the same boy, Dakin (Dominic Cooper), who learns early on how to use his physical charms to his advantage. The story is suffused in that public British schoolboy homoeroticism emblematic of the genre, but the subject is handled in a thoughtful, non-hysterical way that you'd never see in Hollywood versions of the sacred bond between pupil and teacher.
 
  There's a difference too in the dramatization of a well-imparted education. The teachers and pupils act and argue, mock one another and defend their positions in lively torrents of conversation. If the kids seem impossibly erudite, "The History Boys" is a paean to the possibilities of education, or a eulogy.
 
  "I didn't want to turn out boys who in later life had a deep love of literature," Hector says. "Or who would talk in middle age of the lure of language and their love of words. 'Words' said in that reverential way that is somehow Welsh." The headmaster, of course, speaks of "words" in precisely that way — worse, he describes their value using capitalist jargon, insincerely crowing that Hector has made the boys "shareholders" in the corporation of English literature. The boys, as they will do, reach their own conclusions. But it's the process of reaching them that makes them who they are.

Because there will always be an England, there will always be English stories about some brilliant professor or other whose profound positive influence on the boys under his tutelage is colored by wittily expressed memories of the old goat's foolish (rather than harmful) homosexual hanky-panky. Had The History Boys  been an American play (rather than a Tony award-laden import from Britain's famed National Theatre), the peccadillo that catches up with corpulent, charismatic general studies teacher Mr. Hector (Harry Potter 's corpulent, charismatic Richard Griffiths) would more likely be pot-smoking or a thing for wearing panties on his head at home than a penchant for genially groping a teenage boy's genitals while the untraumatized student tolerates the ritual on the back of Hector's motorcycle. The frightfully eloquent British playwright Alan Bennett (The Madness of George III ) tosses off Hector's handiwork as the minor foible of a lonely, passionate, sympathetic fellow, which I don't buy.
Anyhow, The History Boys  is as much about the meaning and value of reading and learning as it is about the ho-humness of genital fondling by sir with love: Is education important as an end in itself or as a means to making one's way in the world? For the eight unpolished public-school boys in northern England prepping for acceptance into Oxford and Cambridge in 1983, the question isn't an idle one. The arrival of a hipper, younger smoothy tutor (Stephen Campbell Moore) who represents the pragmatic  approach sets the energetic, articulate debate in motion, with various teachers and boys making smart speeches (and quoting poetry) on behalf of one way of living or the other.
The movie adaptation has been lifted from the theater with original cast and director Nicholas Hytner intact; the actors interact as cozily as chums on a playing field, even when the camera fusses with landscape long shots in an effort to think outside the stage, and in reaction-shot close-ups that fondle the boys'...faces.

 The current of intellectual energy snapping through “The History Boys,” the ferociously engaging screen adaptation of Alan Bennett’s Tony Award-winning play, set in a  boys’ school in northern England in 1983, feels like electrical brain stimulation. As two teachers jockey for the hearts and minds of eight teenage schoolboys preparing to apply to Oxford and Cambridge, their epigrams send up small jolts of pleasure and excitement. How to teach and interpret history is the question.  One view is represented by Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore), a hotshot young tutor and symbol of Thatcher-era go-getter mentality,  hired by the school to scrape away the rust of received opinion from the students’ thinking so that their answers to test questions will have more “edge.” On the other side is Hector (Richard Griffiths), the poetry-spouting, eccentric teacher of general studies. An obese, 50-something school fixture (imagine a squishier, teary-eyed Charles Laughton or Peter Ustinov), Hector cares deeply about how knowledge is applied to life. A married homosexual, he might be described as Mr. Chips With Kinks.  His pure idealism is measured by his response to a student during a discussion of the Holocaust. When the boy reels off a quote from Wittgenstein  —  “Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent”  —  Hector scolds him for glibness and for treating the words as “a dinky formula.” A true believer in the humanizing power of education, Hector subscribes to the academic credo of A. E. Housman: “All human knowledge is precious whether or not it serves the slightest human use.”  Most of the best lines, of course, go to Irwin, a cynic who is also gay and who wouldn’t dream of scolding anyone for glibness. “History nowadays is not a matter of conviction,” he declares. “It’s a performance. It’s entertainment.”  “Truth,” he insists, “is no more at issue in an examination than thirst at a wine-tasting or fashion at a striptease.”  Hector lands in trouble when he is caught  touching a student on the back of his motorcycle and is reported.  When the school’s ambitious, stiff-backed headmaster (Clive Merrison) confronts him with his behavior, Hector ruefully replies, “The transmission of knowledge is in itself an erotic act.”  “The History Boys” sympathizes with Hector, whom Mr. Griffith plays not as a predator but as a lonely dreamer whose ineffectual gropes are not much different from pats on the back. These whip-smart 17- and 18-year-old students not only tolerate his fumbling advances but also accept them with good humor as expressions of devotion.  The movie is a streamlined adaptation of the  National Theater production in London, which was heaped with praise when it arrived on Broadway in April for a limited engagement. Although minor characters have been added (including a religious gym teacher) and scenes excised, the film retains the play’s quicksilver pace along with an airiness and cheek that vaguely recall the ’60s films of Richard Lester.  The film was created by the same hands who made the play, including Mr. Bennett, who adapted the script, and the director Nicholas Hytner. The actors playing the eight students are the same ones who originated the roles in London, then brought them to New York. If they seem a little old for the parts, they make a seamless ensemble.  Transferred to the screen with its language intact, “The History Boys” inevitably feels less like a movie than like an academic vaudeville show. In one scene the students converse comically in French. Interwoven with the serious monologues are vintage popular songs (“Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered”) and scenes from old movies (“Now, Voyager” and “Brief Encounter”) performed by the students with a deadpan playfulness. If these songs and re-enacted film bits seem anachronistic choices for a movie set in the 1980s (the soundtrack includes period rock by the Clash and other groups), without its breezy horseplay “The History Boys” would come across as a drier, English answer to “Dead Poets Society.”  The acting is wonderful. Mr. Moore’s avid Irwin and Mr. Griffiths’s shambling Hector are matched by the extraordinary Frances de la Tour as Dorothy Lintott, the droopy, horse-faced history teacher with a baritone voice who is the wisest and most balanced member of an academic triumvirate. Dorothy belatedly has her say when she observes with an amused exasperation: “History is a commentary on the various and continuing incapabilities of men. History is women following behind with the bucket.”  All this verbal dexterity should awaken in viewers a wistful Anglophilic envy. How often do the most articulate characters in American films express themselves with such finesse?  Here is another of Irwin’s best. “There’s no better way of forgetting something than by commemorating it,” he says, commenting on the British inability to assume more responsibility for World War I.  Of the eight students, cocky, seductive Dakin (Dominic Cooper), his eyes hotly glued on the headmaster’s secretary, Fiona (Georgia Taylor), is the most charismatic. Applying the history of World War I to his potential conquest, he compares her to the Western Front. Madly in love with Dakin is his gay, Jewish fellow student Posner (Samuel Barnett), who suggests a younger, nerdier Irwin. These two spend the most time under the movie’s microscope.  Next on the list are the overweight, clownish Timms (James Corden);  the dumb jock Rudge (Russell Tovey);  and Scripps (Jamie Parker), a voluble Christian. The others, who include a black and a Muslim student, barely register except as voices and faces in the ensemble.  For all its delights, “The History Boys” is not a world-changing work of art. It is exactly what Irwin calls history: entertainment, a scintillating contrivance that is only as good as its epigrams. Below the surface lies a gooey custard filling.  “The History Boys’’ is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language and sexually explicit dialogue.
On Broadway, where it won six Tonys and became a modest hit despite the absence of a Disney  cartoon character in the cast, Alan Bennett 's dog-eared paean to the wonders and horrors of grammar school life carried a nearly mythic resonance. No matter the 1980s Sheffield  setting, it was instantly familiar to anyone who's ever been young, questioned the purpose of a slide rule, and felt like the world was yours for the taking. Made by the same creative principalsBennett, director Nicholas Hytner , and a superb cast who have now been with their roles for far longer than a termthe film version of The History Boys is a lesser thing, more fixed in space and time and rendered almost unbearably "cinematic" in patches by Hytner's gymnastic camerawork. Yet the ideas and feelings of the piece remain so rich that it almost doesn't matter. The "history" under discussion here is that of history itself, as the classroom of the beloved Hector (the ebulliently rumpled Richard Griffiths ) becomes a crucible for the debate over learning for its own sake versus "teaching to the test." But if The History Boys arrives at a perilous moment for culture and learning, it nevertheless instills in you hope for the youth of tomorrow, and a newfound appreciation for the lyrical value of compound adjectives.
