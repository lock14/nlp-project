With "Perfect Stranger," Halle Berry enters that stage of her career where we seriously consider asking for her Oscar back.
A laughably overheated thriller from the once promising James Foley (remember the Sean Penn /Christopher Walken movie "At Close Range," way back in 1986? ), "Stranger" shows Berry turning from the Dorothy Dandridge of her generation into just another Ashley Judd. Like Judd's "Twisted" or the Meg Ryan fiasco "In the Cut," the new movie is the kind of "dark," "sexy" mystery where all the men are heavy-breathing psychos and all the twists preposterous.
Berry plays Rowena Price, a crusading journalist whose exposé of a page-turning senator gets shut down by her editor. Looking for a new target, she's alerted by a slatternly friend from her past (Nicki Aycox) to the fact that powerful advertising executive Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis) likes to take his online flirtations real and rough. The friend has proof, until the friend turns up dead.
With the help of her jittery Guy Friday, Miles (Giovanni Ribisi), Ro gets hired as a temp at Hill's agency, playacting a dewy-eyed innocent named Katherine Pogue. At the same time, she's working Hill into a cybersexual lather as an online vixen named Veronica. Which one of her personae will be targeted next, and can Ro even keep them straight?
Someday someone will make a great movie about the politics of sexual identity in the Internet age. It won't be a thriller, and it certainly won't be "Perfect Stranger," a film that has trouble creating one memorable character, let alone multiple ones, and whose idea of turning up the heat is to show people typing faster.
Ribisi juices up his role as the one character who's so crazy he can't 
be the guilty party, while Willis just ghosts through the film: an empty suit, a hairpiece, and nothing in between. (He had a lot more fun in his 
overstuffed sex thriller, 1994's "Color of Night.") Berry can't do a thing with the part of Rowena -- the character's just a series of tough/scared poses in screenwriter Todd Komarnicki's word-processing software, heading toward a revelation that nullifies everything leading up to it.
Someone like Judd might stomp through a role like this on sheer trashy conviction, but Berry doesn't have the capability or, much more crucially, the nerve. After "Gothika " and "Catwoman ," a viewer has to wonder: Why does this woman keep making thrillers if she can't bring herself to be thrilled?


         There's been a lot of agonized hand-wringing about the cost to society of the possible demise of newspapers, but one major negative consequence has been overlooked. What the heck are the movies going to do for careers for intrepid heroines if newspaper reporter is out of the running?
 
 True, Rowena Price (Halle Berry), ace investigative reporter for the mythical New York Courier and protagonist of "Perfect Stranger," is not exactly Lois Lane material. She's introduced using false pretenses to entrap a U.S. senator and then record him without his knowledge, activities that will not endear her to the Pulitzer board, but no matter. "God," Rowena says triumphantly, "I love this job."
 


         






   For this is the movies, after all, and making Rowena a reporter makes it easier for her to launch her own investigation of prime suspect Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis) when childhood friend Grace Clayton (Nicki Aycox) turns up brutally murdered. So much information to gather, so little time.
 
 As might be guessed by now, "Perfect Stranger" is a star vehicle — set in New York, the city that never sleeps, or even takes naps. It is an acceptable enough thriller, neither the worst  you've seen nor the opposite. However, it's also one of those films in which the question of why it was made is as much of a puzzle as  who did the awful deed. By the time you figure these  out, you no longer care.
 
  On the most basic level, this James Foley-directed film got the go-ahead because two bankable stars agreed to be in it. So watching it is kind of like viewing the visual echo of a business deal, or, more specifically, a merger between powerful corporations, each with its own assets and skill sets.
 
 Berry, for her part, gets to look great and dominate the picture, while Willis, who by this time can do these roles in his sleep, can likely be taken at his word when he says he signed on because of the working conditions: "Not a hard day at the office — go to work and flirt with Halle Berry."
 
 Just as the film's initial entrapped senator subplot plays out, Rowena runs into old pal Grace on a Manhattan subway platform. Seems Grace is in town to pursue the physical side of a liaison that began online with Harrison Hill. Yes, that Harrison Hill, the big-bucks advertising executive who is the master of all he surveys. So when Grace turns up dead the very next day, Rowena knows whom she wants to start investigating.
 
  In this mission she has the assistance of pal Miles Haley (Giovanni Ribisi), your standard demon Internet researcher whose computer can do everything except cook dinner and make the bed. Miles has a major crush on Rowena, to the point of telling her: "Can I say for the record, 'Wow'?" when she looks especially good. And because he is played by Ribisi, who specializes in this, Miles also has something of a weirdo vibe.
 
 Miles uses his computer to get Rowena a temp job at Hill's advertising agency, where the boss, not surprisingly, notices Our Girl and tries to put the moves on her even though he's very much married. Unbeknownst to Hill, Rowena is also anonymously chatting with him online in the kind of conversation where she tells him her hair is "dirty blond" and he responds, "I like dirty." That's how they do things in New York.
 
  As written by Todd Komarnicki from a story by Jon Bokenkamp, "Perfect Stranger" offers lots of misdirection and closing twists as it plays with the notion of who's playing whom for a fool. By the time everything falls into place, however, it doesn't much matter. The best thrillers don't just show up for the closing credits, they are involving all along the way. That's where "Perfect Stranger" goes imperfectly wrong.

Did you know that people in Internet chat rooms are not always who they say they are? Really, it's true! I learned this in Perfect Stranger , a crappy thriller gussied up with a chrome-plated veneer. Halle Berry, whose million-dollar body is on proud display in a slinky on-the-job wardrobe, plays an ace investigative journalist named Rowena who discovers the addictive virtual reality of instant messaging a mere decade behind the rest of us. Thanks to Rowena, I also learned that the reason more tabloid dirt-diggers like the one played by Berry don't expose the misconduct of, say, homophobic, secretly gay United States senators is that a good-old-boy network of men in government and media collude to squash the truth. Plus, I learned that Victoria's Secret is launching a new line of cleavage-enhancing bras called Very Sexy. I confirmed this last fact on the Internet, so it has to be true. Victoria's Secret's website, however, mentions nothing about an ad campaign conceived by a fictional agency headed by someone played by Bruce Willis. So now I don't know what to believe!
Except this: Perfect Stranger  has been conceived by people motivated entirely by product placement, whether that product is celebrity casting, consumer goods (Victoria's Secret bras, Vaio computers, Heineken beer, Reebok shoes, NYC's stylish Hotel Gansevoort), or button-pushing plot elements (Senate scandal, repressed memories of a molesting daddy, stalker tendencies of lovelorn computer geeks). This slack, overworked entertainment, directed in spasms of artistic anxiety by James Foley (At Close Range ), is a rote compendium of Internet paranoia clichés, with frequent pauses to admire Berry's derriere, décolletage, and related assets. Less admirable are Willis' generic moves as an ad mogul  with a face seemingly mobile only from the nose down  still capable of bagging every beautiful woman on the payroll. (Lothario's tip: Take her to the stylish Hotel Gansevoort!)
Next on his hit list? Ro herself. Recently she nailed an exposé of a slimy senator for her tabloid, the fictional New York Courier , with the assistance of her adoring computer-whiz colleague Miles (Giovanni Ribisi). But the story's just been killed by spineless higher-ups, so she indignantly quits the paper, although not before delivering a speech of outrage that is about as much acting as Berry can handle, so busy is she being corseted and lit to perfection. (The exposé on how the working girl affords her big-bucks frocks, let alone her rambling, expensively furnished apartment in Manhattan's historic Ansonia apartment building, where Babe Ruth and Igor Stravinsky once lived, has yet to be written.)
But the instinct for nosing around dies hard with a vengeance. A childhood friend (Cold Case 's Nicki Aycox, telegraphing trouble with crazy-girl eyes) comes to Rowena with a sad tale about a creep she met online, someone who treated her badly  the selfsame powerful advertising mogul, Harrison Hill (Willis). Soon enough, the girl with crazy eyes turns up dead. Murdered. And Ro gets busy busting another slimy man (there's no male who isn't guilty in the movie's femme-affronted universe) by typing prettily in chat rooms to lure her prey; for nonreaders, she also speaks as she types. As she explains in the rudimentary script by TV writer Todd Komarnicki, ''All it takes to commit a murder are the right ingredients at the right time.'' Doesn't that flavorless recipe apply equally well to committing a soufflé?
Inevitably, the new project demands new duds, and not one but two new identities. The sleuth gets herself hired as a temp worker called Katherine at Hill's agency, a hothouse of assistant babes and slimy male execs. And, with the help of Miles the lovelorn tech buddy, she establishes a flirtatious online correspondence with the boss as Veronica. (We know Miles hides his own secrets because Ribisi, typecast playing guys who obsess too much or sleep too little, is lit to highlight creepy under-eye shadows, and his own apartment  appears to be part fluorescent art installation, part homage to The Silence of the Lambs .)
Inevitably, nobody is who he or she appears to be, least of all Ro. Flashbacks to her childhood don't just hint at withheld information, they shake us by the shoulders and go ''boo.'' Perfect Stranger  is spam  not only commercially generated, but irritating in the faith that buyers will be as dumb about Internet-based thrillers as the sellers are. My advice is to delete without opening.

 In the sleek, paranoid world of “Perfect Stranger,” the Internet and the ugly side of human nature converge to evoke a treacherous corporate climate of multiple identities, high-tech spying, obsessive prurience, blackmail and murder. Communication is carried on under assumed names in e-mail messages, instant messages and coded cellphone texts. Every character is an unscrupulous go-getter with a cache of guilty secrets to protect.  There is enough of a grain of truth in this noirish thriller, directed by James Foley from a screenplay by Todd Komarnicki, that even after it lurches from the far-fetched into the preposterous, “Perfect Stranger” leaves a clammy residue of unease. Although set in the corridors of New York media giants, it often feels like a Hollywood fever dream responding to the wave of scandals and cover-ups coming out of Washington. To the movie’s ruthless power brokers and climbers, the most precious human commodity is loyalty, the ability to keep a dirty secret under wraps. But loyalty has its price.  Halle Berry, not the warmest actress, is the putative heroine, Rowena Price, a star investigative reporter for a rag called The New York Courier. Rowena, who dishes out sensational exposés under a male pseudonym, doesn’t resemble any journalist I’ve ever met. As she slithers through the movie’s chilly upscale jungle, her only ethical principle seems to be that in the pursuit of dirt, the ends always justify the means.  In the film’s creepy opening scene, she visits a married congressman with gubernatorial aspirations under friendly pretenses and confronts him with evidence of his sexual relationship with a male intern. When he offers her “anything you want” not to print the revelation, she refuses. But he pulls strings with her bosses and gets his way, and Rowena quits in a huff.  An encounter in the subway with a childhood friend, Grace (Nicki Aycox), leads Rowena to her next sleuthing expedition. Not long after their meeting, Grace is found dead, the victim of poisoning. Rowena suspects that the killer is Harrison Hill (Bruce Willis), a married, compulsively philandering advertising mogul whom Grace had stalked relentlessly after he ended their affair.  Enlisting her journalistic sidekick  Miles Haley (Giovanni Ribisi), a ratty cyber-wizard who can hack his way through any firewall, she initiates a seductive cat-and-mouse game with Harrison in which she assumes two identities. She becomes both Katherine Pogue, an office temp who takes a job at Harrison’s agency, catches his roving eye and begins a dangerous flirtation, and Veronica, who rubs libidos with Harrison in a chat room where he bombards her with the usual coy questions about lingerie. (The movie has blatant and extended product plugs for Victoria’s Secret and Reebok.)  Before long Katherine and Harrison are in a chic restaurant, sipping the movie’s cocktail of choice, a “Hemingway daiquiri,” and he is nuzzling her neck. Harrison and Veronica also arrange an assignation in a downtown hotel. None of it makes much sense. Although the movie pretends otherwise, the supposed evidence that Rowena compiles against Harrison is flimsy at best.  Nor is Ms. Berry able to untangle her character’s personalities, one of which emerges in a ludicrous bombshell revelation in the movie’s final scene. Ms. Berry, as always, looks great but fails to project the innate sensuality you expect to accompany such beauty. Tense and snippy, she conveys the wary insecurity of an actress who is unaware of her charms and overcompensates by trying too hard to act.  Mr. Willis strolls through the role of a smirking cobra with the blithe detachment of an actor who knows that when playing a master of the universe, less is more. All that’s required is the narrowing of his eyes, then sweeping the room with a cunning gaze. Only once does Harrison blow his cool, in a scene in which he fires and replaces a disloyal employee in a violent 30-second explosion.  Mr. Ribisi’s Miles appears to be a devoted puppy until the moment we observe him hiding in a dark corner of Rowena’s apartment while she makes love with her boyfriend, Cameron (Gary Dourdan), a character so cursory that he barely exists.  The director, as he showed in movies like “After Dark, My Sweet,” and “Fear,” specializes in conjuring conspiratorial atmospheres in which anxiety and sexual menace hang in the air like a heavy, bitter perfume. Long after you’ve dismissed the movie’s ridiculous, convoluted story, traces of that scent may linger.  “Perfect Stranger” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, some nudity, violence and strong language.

Pink is the new black, 50 is the new 30 and, at the movies, confusion is the new suspense. The cause may be test screenings, moviemaking-by-committee or simple insecurity, but whatever the reason, Exhibit A is "Perfect Stranger," a disorienting cocktail of illogic and hysteria that requires an 11th-hour soliloquy just to explain what's happened. Sony/Revolution thriller should find an audience, thanks to Halle Berry, Bruce Willis and a frantically edited trailer. Whether that aud can find a rational plotline is anybody's guess.
Berry -- seemingly out to justify, or have revoked, the Oscar she won for "Monster's Ball" -- overacts throughout, and Willis gets to turn his smirk up to 10. But at least they attract some sympathy -- Berry as New York Post-y reporter Rowena Price, who treats journalistic ethics the way a Rottweiler treats a shag carpet; and Willis as ad mogul Harrison Hill, who may or may not have killed Rowena's childhood friend, Grace (Nicki Aycox).
Posing as a temp at Hill's agency -- while also working with fellow journalist Miles (Giovanni Ribisi) to connect Harrison's e-mail to the late Grace's inbox -- Ro walks a wobbly tightrope of assumed identities and erotic innuendo, while having the occasional flashback about childhood sex abuse.
There's clearly a lot going on, but nary a solid plot point amid this vortex of improbabilities. It's admirable that "Perfect Stranger" keeps the viewer off-balance so much of the time, but the difference between a satisfying thriller and a hodgepodge of happenstance is whether one eventually can connect the mysterious dots. Helmer James Foley keeps about half the ingredients hidden until the last possible moment. And that's hardly playing fair.
The pic looks good, and Antonio Pinto's music is affecting, but Todd Komarnicki's script thinks it's far smarter than it is -- the pseudo-profundity runs thick and rich, and what should be killer lines land like matzoh balls dropped off a 30-story building. "Everyone has secrets -- until they're found out" is Ro's contribution to Western thought. "Perfect Stranger" proves it's possible to be obvious and obscure at the same time.

When the big, bad powers-that-be fuck her over on her exposé of an intern-fucking U.S. senator, star newspaper reporter Halle Berry  says "Fuck you" to the world of print journalismuntil, that is, her old childhood friend (Nicki Aycox ) washes up dead in the Hudson, and Berry sets out to put the screws to the smarmy ad exec (Bruce Willis ) who was fucking the dead woman behind his wife's back. Pulling her best Lois Lane, Berry  goes undercover in Willis's glittering glass-and-steel office and, with a little IT help from her own Jimmy Olsen  (Giovanni Ribisi ), starts giving the boss virtual cock teases under the IM handle "Rocketgirl." Directed with palpable fatigue by James Foley  (who once made good moviesAfter Dark My Sweet , At Close Range ) from a script by novelist Todd Komarnicki , Perfect Stranger derives some novelty value from its colorblind casting and from being the most ludicrously silly Hollywood  fuck-fest since the Willis-starring Color of Night (minus that movie's comic self-awareness). But as a thriller, it's so by-the-numbers that it's hardly worth keeping count. In the end, so much damning evidence has been amassed against nearly all the main characters that the final revelation feels like the one that merely tested the best. Perhaps, Clue -style, they should have included them all. It certainly would have lent new meaning to the expression, "Colonel Mustard did it in the pantry."
