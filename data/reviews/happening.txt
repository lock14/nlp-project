"The Happening" has the distinction of being far scarier for the ideas behind it than for anything in it.
Early in the movie - after women in New York's Central Park have suddenly begun stabbing themselves in the neck with hairpins and East Side construction workers have thrown themselves off girders - Philadelphia high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) asks his students for theories on why honeybee populations are plummeting around the world. On a blackboard he has written Albert Einstein's quote that if bees disappeared humans would follow within four years.
Despite the inconvenient fact that there's no record of Einstein ever actually saying such a thing, it's a frightening thought. The camera could hold on that blackboard for the movie's 90 minutes and many of us wouldn't be able to sleep for a week.
But no: M. Night Shyamalan has metaphors to torture. Actors and audiences, too. "The Happening" asks what would happen if Planet Earth decided to reject the species bedeviling its surface, and the best it can come up with is a slack, increasingly ludicrous B-movie about people running in terror from . . . wind.
I'll dance around the specifics of what's causing the mass trances followed by suicides - you can Google it easily enough and, besides, "The Happening" spills its own beans early in the game. Suffice to say that after a reasonably goose-bumpy opening 20 minutes, Elliot finds himself fleeing the city with his unsteady wife, Alma (Zooey Deschanel), his math teacher best friend (John Leguizamo), and the latter's 7-year-old daughter (Ashlyn Sanchez).
We're in Apocalypse Right Now territory then, a genre whose surges of mass panic are familiar from "The Day After Tomorrow," "Cloverfield," "The Mist," and Spielberg's "War of the Worlds," among many others. These movies exist to reflect and package (and resolve) our nagging fears of extinction; they take the powerlessness we feel from reading the headlines and sell it back to us with popcorn. Nameless dread is easier to cope with when it's only two hours long.
"The Happening," though, sells it back to us with a lecture and not nearly enough visual aids. As the "event" takes hold across the Northeast, the characters join up with and split off from smaller and smaller groups, gradually piecing together the puzzle long after we've sussed it out. Shyamalan, as is his wont, prefers to tell rather than show: At one point, the characters pass through an uncompleted real estate development whose sign didactically informs us "You Deserve This."
Not this pompous moralizing, we don't. The mood of lowering environmental doom established in the early scenes dissipates, and "The Happening" doesn't bother to replace it with anything but flaccid atmosphere. We're teased with hints of marital discord between Elliot and Alma, and with the specialness of the little girl who becomes their surrogate child, but none of this goes anywhere. You wait in vain for the patented Shyamalan twist that will kick the story up to the next level, and it never comes: That's the twist. The film slowly strangles on its distaste for its own genre.
The actors, meanwhile, are left stranded. Wahlberg mines a little reflexive humor from his lines, but Deschanel has never seemed so comatose; and while the hulking teen actor Spencer Breslin provides some scruffy adolescent energy, he's not around long enough for it to stick. Late in the film, Betty Buckley turns up as a crazy hermit lady - it's as if Norman Bates's mom were finally getting her cameo - but the film has no idea what to do with her.
Ironically, there's just enough gore in "The Happening" to earn Shyamalan his first R rating (the studio publicity department, desperate to sell the thing, has made much of this fact). The movie is dainty by "Saw" standards, though: A man running himself over with a harvester and a cellphone video of another man offering himself up as dinner to hungry lions at the Philadelphia Zoo is as nasty as it gets.
That last scene has a cheap gonzo zing that suggests the director of "The Sixth Sense" and "Lady in the Water" might finally drop the Hollywood oracle shtick and settle into his genuine gifts as a B-movie visionary. I don't mean that as an insult; once upon a time filmmakers like Don Siegel ("Invasion of the Body Snatchers") and Val Lewton ("Cat People") were able to say profound things within the context of low-budget sci-fi and horror. They frightened us more by showing us less, and they never called it Art.
When he plays to his strengths, Shyamalan can still work our nerves in similar fashion. The early scene where a policeman's gun passes from one tranced-out victim to the next is a small marvel of economic horror, and it carries the larger message of "The Happening" - no one's killing us but ourselves - in its very DNA. The rest of the film is an increasingly gaseous restatement of that theme. You feel like you're not watching the end of the world but the end of a career.


Something in the air is turning normal people into self-destructive crazies prone to flinging themselves off buildings and blowing their brains out. That much, at least, can be shared about The Happening , a feature-length Twilight Zone  episode in which a high school science teacher (Mark Wahlberg  , constricted), his flighty wife (Zooey Deschanel   of the big blue eyes), and an Innocent Little Girl in their care (Ashlyn Sanchez, nearly mute) face down an epidemic of death rampaging through the Northeast. Supposedly, the cause of the catastrophe is unknown  it might be the work of terrorists, a virus, a toxin in the air, or the legacy of nuclear malfeasance. In fact, it's a cinch for any moviegoer familiar with the post-Sixth Sense  oeuvre of writer-director M. Night Shyamalan   to diagnose the situation as an advancing case of crippling Shyamalania.
Some sure symptoms: The movie demonstrates a smart movie geek's obsession with the rhythms and gory details of horror storytelling, undermined by a pompous insistence on spiritual lessons of the tritest kind (don't be mean to Mother Nature! Trust in love!). And the filmmaker has fun with the cinematic conventions of social paranoia (all his most interesting minor characters with unusual faces are surely doomed) but is a sucker for overacting among his major players. I don't know what thespian virus is eating Betty Buckley as an ornery country loner, but I hope it's not contagious.

 The knives had been out and sharpened long before M. Night Shyamalan’s latest movie, “The Happening,” opened on Friday. A fine craftsman with aspirations to the canon, this would-be auteur has, in the last few years, experienced a sensational fall from critical and commercial grace, partly through his own doing — by making bad movies and then, even after those movies failed, by continuing to feed his ego publicly — and partly through the entertainment media that, once they  smell weakness, will always bite the hand they  once slathered in drool.  The signal-to-noise ratio has become so lopsided when it comes to Mr. Shyamalan that “The Happening” was marked for failure even before it had a chance to fail — or succeed. Its worth as a cultural and aesthetic object had been rendered moot, never mind that it turns out to be a divertingly goofy thriller with an animistic bent, moments of shivery and twitchy suspense and a solid lead performance from Mark Wahlberg. Much like Mel Gibson and Joaquin Phoenix in “Signs,” which this film resembles in mood, effectiveness and flaws, Mr. Wahlberg fits into the Shyamalan universe comfortably. He rides the spooky stuff with as much ease as he does the jokes, the manufactured sincerity and cornball messages.  I won’t say too much about the gimmick that Mr. Shyamalan has come up with this time around, only that it’s funny, dark and weird and involves some nasty payback from the natural world. The story opens on a bustlingly bright New York day with two women sharing a bench in Central Park. One hears something, the other doesn’t, and before you know it, one benchwarmer has slipped a hair stick out of her do and into her own neck. The blood continues to trickle, but soon runs into the streets as men and women across the city commit similarly inexplicable acts of self-annihilation, with bullets to the head or, in a queasy, presumably intentional visual echo of Sept. 11, plunges from on high.  This is the first R-rated feature from Mr. Shyamalan, who’s left the PG-13 world behind presumably to entice that much-coveted demographic, the young male bloodsucker. Going graphic has neither hurt nor harmed him, though from all the inventive ways he’s found to do away with characters, it’s hard not to wonder if he’s not extracting symbolic revenge on the fickle moviegoing public. Whatever the case, the opening’s body count works to his foundational purposes, creating an uneasy, unsettled atmosphere. Mr. Shyamalan’s words consistently fail him, as they have in the past. But working again with the cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (a longtime shooter for Jonathan Demme), he creates images — bodies falling, trees rustling — that at their most potent speak louder and more eloquently than those words.  As the suicides rage like the plague, Mr. Wahlberg’s Elliot, a Philadelphia high-school science teacher, heads out of town on a train with his wife, Alma (an oddly miscast, loony-looking Zooey Deschanel, working her big blue peepers like mad), and another teacher, Julian (John Leguizamo), who brings along his young daughter, Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez). The train conductors soon lose contact with the outside world, forcing passengers into the Pennsylvania backwoods. This allows Mr. Shyamalan to focus on his leads (and indulge in witless marital shtick); pick up a couple of crack scene stealers (Frank Collison and Betty Buckley); and frolic in the great outdoors with zippy cameras and special effects. Something wicked this way comes though, really, they’re  already heeere.  Mr. Wahlberg’s earnest, committed presence anchors the story, giving it a sense of purpose (a reason to care). Unlike Ms. Deschanel, who looks mighty surprised to be in this movie or mighty alarmed, you hang on to Mr. Wahlberg, who smoothly navigates the broad, lurching comedy (notably a wonderfully eccentric and comic monologue) as well as the pockets of dread. Mr. Shyamalan’s bag of tricks is awfully familiar — the camera races forward, the characters stand locked in place, a child’s empty swing sways in the wind, eyes widen, mouths gape — but it’s time-tested and, with the right actors, effectual. There is, after all, real pleasure to be had from watching a magician pull even a mangy rabbit out of a battered top hat.  Mr. Shyamalan has come up with a doozy of a premise for “The Happening,” one that will appeal to the doomsday scenarist in every pessimist, so it’s a shame he doesn’t know what to do with it other than mow people down. One of his strengths, evident in his best film, “The Sixth Sense,” and even in misfires like “Lady in the Water,” is that he knows how to withhold enough information — goosing the quiet with well-timed boos and bangs — to keep you asking that crucial storytelling question: What happens next? But here, caught up in art-directing all this death, he forgets to set up the question from scene to scene. The movie unwinds like a series of ghastly tableaux vivants pasted together with sloppy domestic comedy.  By the time the story shifts to a town where people are hanging from trees in overly neat formation, the image of mass suicides has been drained of its shock, and a human calamity is revealed to be an aesthetic choice. Something is happening, all right, but Mr. Shyamalan, who certainly appears to enjoy playing God, doesn’t seem to care much. But what is happening, exactly? Is it the end of the world, a blip on the green screen, a Chernobyl rerun, Al Gore’s worst nightmare?  Mr. Shyamalan tells us, more or less, letting the kitty out of the bag early. But here’s the thing about doomsday scenarios: They require an escape hatch or the weight of tragedy. Just knocking off the world because you’re mad at it isn’t enough.  “The Happening” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bloody death.

One might charitably describe "The Happening" as a transitional work for M. Night Shyamalan. In an attempted rebound from the critical and commercial calamity of "Lady in the Water," the writer-director has scaled back most of his characteristic touches -- the contorted horror/fantasy mythology, the "gotcha" twist ending, even his trademark cameo -- instead serving up a patchy, uninspired eco-thriller whose R rating (a first for Shyamalan) looks more like a B.O. hindrance than an artistic boon. After an initial bloom of interest, the Fox release will likely wilt quickly in the summer heat.
At the very least, Shyamalan's latest will almost certainly be greeted with less impassioned scorn than its predecessor; unlike 2006's "Lady in the Water," it arrives in theaters unencumbered by embarrassing tie-in tell-alls or reports of overweening directorial ego. (And if there are any movie critics among "The Happening's" many victims, the pic doesn't call attention to it.)
Trouble is, it's hard to imagine "The Happening" being greeted with much impassioned anything
. Shyamalan's story -- about a married couple and a small child being driven farther and farther from civilization by a fatal airborne threat -- covers territory already over-tilled by countless disaster epics and zombie movies, offering little in the way of suspense, visceral kicks or narrative vitality to warrant the retread.
A mildly creepy prologue unfolds one morning in Central Park, where several pedestrians suddenly freeze in place and others start committing bizarre acts of self-mutilation and suicide. ("Those people look like they're clawing at themselves," marvels one onlooker, in one of the script's less felicitous examples of telling and not showing.) Meanwhile, the leaves rustle ominously in the wind, providing an early clue to the source of this strange, and deadly, epidemic.
Cut to Philadelphia, where high school science teacher Elliot Moore (Mark Wahlberg) hears of what is initially characterized as a bioterrorist attack. He and his lovely, slightly kooky wife Alma (Zooey Deschanel), traveling with math teacher Julian (an over-talkative John Leguizamo) and his 8-year-old daughter Jess (Ashlyn Sanchez), flee the city, only to have their train break down in the middle of nowhere.
Julian abruptly leaves Jess in the care of Elliot and Alma so he can catch a ride back to the city to search for his wife. Hiking across broad, rather beautiful stretches of Pennsylvania farmland (mostly shot on location), the three soon hook up with other refugees, only to find their way blocked by fresh corpses at every turn -- they see dead people! -- suggesting the danger is closing in on all sides. Yet the fact that the infected kill only themselves immediately dilutes any sense of real peril.

Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock have been Shyamalan's two most oft-cited filmmaking forebears, and the scenario here carries faint echoes of Spielberg's "War of the Worlds" and, particularly, Hitchcock's "The Birds," in that the nature of the threat here (cue more wind effects and trembling branches) seems organic rather than man-made. Elliot, being a science teacher, deduces what's going on fairly quickly, spouting the occasional mouthful of botanical mumbo-jumbo when he's not arguing with Alma.
As he did in "Signs" (which "The Happening" comes to resemble as its characters seek refuge in a little house on the Pennsylvania prairie), Shyamalan tries to show a family breaking down, then piecing itself back together, while an apocalypse rages outside its windows. Yet he never taps into what makes Wahlberg and especially Deschanel so uniquely edgy and compelling to watch, and, although both actors emote bravely, neither feels like an intuitive match for their underwritten roles.
While the R rating allows for more explicit gore effects than Shyamalan has resorted to in the past, the violent incidents are relatively few and typically viewed from a distance. The helmer's gift has always been for conjuring suspense from silences, shadows and enclosed spaces, a talent that gets little workout here.
In short, this is a Shyamalan movie minus the bravado, the swagger; there are no audacious attempts to pull out the rug from under the audience, no ham-fisted lessons about the importance of religious belief or the power of storytelling. The director even limits his customary appearance to an offscreen role, a choice that seems sadly in keeping with the rest of this oddly hesitant, insubstantial film. The big surprise at the end of "The Happening" is that even viewers who've been annoyed by his tricks and traps in the past may find themselves hoping he uses them -- or something better -- the next time around.

What a bunch of nonsenseeffective nonsense, chilling nonsense, occasionally wrenching nonsense, but nonsense nonetheless. This is what happens when M. Night Shyamalan  tries to play both John Carpenter  (bloody) and Stanley Kubrick  (cold-blooded) while writing and directing what the literalist will either dismiss or embrace as the horror-film extension of An Inconvenient Truth , depending upon who the literalist thinks is responsible for, ya know, killing the planet. No spoilers here, because theres nothing to give awaynot even the alleged cause of the toxin that causes folks in the Northeast to go loopy before killing themselves with whatevers handy (a cops gun, a shard of glass, a sidewalk 40 stories down  a rotor tiller, ick). One minute folks are enjoying themselves in Central Park , the next theyre stabbing and shooting themselves for the following, oh, 90 minutes give or take. (The films first 10 minutes are, down to the last second, unrelentingly horrific.) Mark Wahlberg , as a Philly science teacher obsessed with the sudden decline in the bee population, and Zooey Deschanel , as his disinterested missus, plod through the Pennsylvania countryside in search of a safe haven, only they cant find one; the toxins everywhere . But, if nothing else, a couple experiencing a few hiccupsshes contemplating an affair with the voice of Shyamalan, making one of his more clever cameosfinds it easier to talk shit out when death is imminent. Which is a decent point, even if you have to avoid the piles of corpses on your way to therapy.
