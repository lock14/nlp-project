         So, it's not "Rosemary's Baby," but George Ratliff's "Joshua" is nevertheless languidly seductive and creepy, perfect for a hot summer night when nobody has the energy to pose a lot of questions.
 
 Not least among its pleasures is the chance to briefly inhabit the world of the newly superrich — that "it" über-class everyone is talking about lately. Shot on location in New York, every inch of the movie looks burnished, lush and expensive. You couldn't pick a nicer place to fall apart in after your evil kid starts wrecking your life.
 


         






   Joshua Cairn (Jacob Kogan) is a highly intelligent, unusually formal 9-year-old who dislikes sports and loves Bartók and his sophisticated composer uncle, Ned (Dallas Roberts). He lives in hip Edwardian style high above Central Park with his father, Brad (Sam Rockwell), a hedge fund guy, and his mom, Abby (Vera Farmiga), who appears to lead a rich psychiatric life. With their matching rumpled haircuts and rock 'n' roll attitudes, Brad and Abby seem out of place in the world of finance — near the beginning of the movie, they attend a recital at Joshua's exclusive school.
 
 "I hate these people," Abby whispers to Brad after a dispiriting round of small talk with some people named Abernathy. "Are we these people?" Encouraging as it is to believe that it's possible to drift ambivalently into their tax bracket, sneering along the way, it's apparent that the point of Brad and Abby's hipsterism is mainly to differentiate them from Joshua, the unfathomable little creep who somehow sprung from their trendy loins.
 
 Herein is the clever, if not exactly fully realized, conceit of "Joshua," which likens parenthood to drawing straws. You're stuck with what you get — but what if what you get scares you? Rockwell and Farmiga are darkly funny as the cool, sexy, not-too-bright parents of a morbid kid who looks like a miniaturized funeral director. Joshua surprises them in doorways and makes their skin crawl with his cloying but strangely emotionless declarations of love. Even his handwriting looks as if  it was cribbed from Edward Gorey. When he enters the room, Brad and Abby stop laughing. Nine years appear to have done nothing to diminish their surprise and dismay.
 
 When their daughter Lily is born, Abby categorically refuses to hire help — she even pooh-poohs Brad's mother Hazel's (Celia Weston) offer to stay. The  rash (and unbelievable) decision stands out as a plot point intended to allow Abby to have her imminent psychotic break in peace. Ravaged by postpartum depression and sleep deprivation, Abby takes a swan dive off the deep end. Brad tries for a while to keep it together, then reverts to a post-collegiate slacker state that involves wearing pajama bottoms in public.
 
 Joshua, meanwhile, continues to rattle everybody with his strange — or is it annoying but more or less normal? — behavior. He disobeys his dad, hides from his mom, mimics them, spies on them and makes his little sister cry.
 
 Although it's established that this sort of thing has happened before — her last breakdown is conveniently chronicled in a home videotape — the speed and intensity with which she goes crazy come as a shock, as does a last-minute wrench involving a child psychiatrist who  suggests things may not have been what they seemed. By the end, you feel as bewildered as Brad and Abby — you're still wondering what this kid is all about. But clever performances and great atmospherics compensate for the gaps in logic.
 
 
 "Joshua." MPAA rating: R for language and some disturbing behavior by a child. Running time: 105 minutes. In limited release.   

 Uneasily straddling age groups and genres, “Joshua” is a highly effective family drama cloaked in the stale tropes of the demon-seed thriller. This could be a brilliant marketing strategy (two demographics for the price of one) or the accidental consequence of trusting a generic idea to an unusually thoughtful and restrained director (George Ratliff, who also wrote the script, with David Gilbert). Either way, there is so much on screen to enjoy that the movie’s endgame flight into excess is disappointing but not disastrous.  Buffing its tacky premise to an industrial-strength gloss, “Joshua” zeroes in on the privileged marriage of Brad and Abby Cairn (Sam Rockwell and Vera Farmiga), whose plush New York City apartment boasts a grand piano and a Central Park view. The piano is for their 9-year-old son, Joshua (Jacob Kogan), a musical prodigy and a joyless child with televangelist-perfect hair and an unhealthy interest in embalming. Favoring preppie outfits and ramrod posture, Joshua is as polished and robotic — and as lethal to old ladies and small animals — as his cinematic forebears, like Rhoda in “The Bad Seed” and Henry in “The Good Son,” though neither, to my recollection, ever broke from ghoulish pursuits long enough to master Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 12.  The arrival of a new baby with the lungs of an opera singer intensifies Joshua’s weirdness and triggers Abby’s barely latent depression. As the family structure begins to buckle, Mr. Ratliff adopts a tone that’s plangent rather than jolting. With each passing day of her screaming newborn’s life, Abby’s face grows a little more crumpled and her hair increasingly wild. Her luxurious home, like the cavernous apartment in “Rosemary’s Baby,” becomes a hostile space, echoing with the mysterious scufflings of unseen neighbors. And, in the hands of the Belgian cinematographer Benoît Debie, the light from the windows is worthy of the Rapture and the glow from the refrigerator is downright unearthly.  In this coldly elegant setting, evil manifests without the aid of the usual retro-gothic signifiers like the inverted crucifix or the malevolent nanny. Instead the sinister is an elusive presence, as much a part of the mise-en-scène as the baby’s crib, to which Joshua is developing an eerie attraction. But for Abby, trapped in her gleaming prison with not one but two disagreeable children, the more immediate horror is motherhood itself.  For all its surface glamour and mainstream ambitions “Joshua” taps into something dark and guilty about being a parent, acknowledging that innocence is not necessarily every child’s default position. “You don’t have to love me,” Joshua tells his stunned father, admitting — in a way the adult cannot — that some children are intrinsically unlovable. Because of this attention to naturalism, the movie digs deeper than its predecessors to unearth truths that few parents care to face. (Witness the storm of outrage when the writer  Ayelet Waldman confessed, in a 2005 essay and later on “The Oprah Winfrey Show,” to loving her husband more than her children.)  Poised self-consciously between art and entertainment, “Joshua” offers imaginative staging and some superb performances. Celia Weston is all clenched teeth and frozen hair as Joshua’s aggressively Christian grandmother, while Dallas Roberts brings so much charisma to the minor role of an empathetic uncle, you wish he were around more often.    But it’s Sam Rockwell’s spectacular turn as the harried paterfamilias that simultaneously binds the film and pushes its boundaries. Whether coddling his character’s doped-up wife or reaching out to his wacky son, Mr. Rockwell is never less than convincing as a stressed-out dad whose life is slowly disintegrating. The story might get away from him, but his grip on that character never falters.    “Joshua” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has breast-feeding, child-slapping, granny-pushing and rodent-stuffing.

"Joshua" is a creepy-little-kid suspenser decked out with sufficient class to lend it a certain distinction. Narrowly conceived and filled with narrative tropes familiar from many other movies, fiction feature debut by George Ratliff, who made his name with the Halloween docu "Hell House," boasts enough in the way of sharp acting, as well as visual and musical smarts, to give the psychological twists and turns a respectable aesthetic context. Fox Searchlight Sundance pickup lacks the shocks, blood and guts to put it over with big-opening-weekend horror geeks, but a smart campaign should nevertheless generate solid returns in all markets.
"Do you ever feel weird about me, your weird son?" 9-year-old Joshua Cairn (Jacob Kogan) inquires of his father Brad (Sam Rockwell), a successful Wall Street trader. "You don't have to love me." Granted, Joshua might have reason to feel a bit put out at the moment, as his mother Abby (Vera Farmiga) has just brought a newborn sister to the family's beautiful apartment overlooking Central Park.
But Joshua is, in fact, more than a bit weird. Impeccably polite and primly attired, the boy is so intellectually advanced his teacher advises moving him ahead a couple of years in school, and he's also a piano prodigy, with a natural leaning toward pieces of modern dissonance. He also receives sympathetic attention from his uncle Ned (Dallas Roberts), a gay art and culture maven for whom Joshua feels a greater affinity than he does for his more immediate family.
With the passage of time marked by notations of the baby's age in days, the mood at home becomes more unsettled. The baby cries incessantly, pushing the already edgy Abby to the brink of despair; at this point, her refusal to hire babysitters seems absurd. Joshua tosses out all his childhood toys, disembowels his favorite stuffed animal, develops a sudden interest in mummification, then pretends to grieve when the family dog mysteriously dies, as do the hamsters in his classroom.
Ratliff and co-scripter David Gilbert concoct further incidents -- Granny suffers an unlikely accident, Abby is packed off to a nursing home -- which collectively raise the central question of whether they are coincidental events or actually the product of a young mind more prodigiously evil than anyone could have imagined.
Pic holds audience attention reasonably well up to the climactic revelation thanks especially to the shrewd casting of, and performances from, Rockwell and screen debutant Kogan. Rockwell energizes the screen with his alertness; his Brad always seems to be thinking ahead as to what will please or interest his son and wife, and as the latter goes further off the deep end, ever more is required of him.
By contrast, Kogan's Joshua is quietly poised, unflappable and enigmatic, to no one moreso than his parents, who can only wonder how they produced such a precocious egghead. With his abundant dark hair, steady gaze and defiant serenity, Kogan resembles the child actor Buddy Swan, who played the young Charles Foster Kane in "Citizen Kane," and commands centerstage in every scene he's in. He also clearly played the sometimes difficult piano pieces required.
Farmiga perhaps starts her portrait of hysteria at too high a register; her character is a pill from the outset, making one want her to go away whenever she's around. With limited screen time, Roberts deftly sketches in an interesting character as Joshua's aesthetically minded uncle.
Tech package is unusually good for this sort of picture, with three key collaborators having made notable contributions: production designer Rochelle Berliner, who created a warm, lived-in look for the apartment; cinematographer Benoit Debie ("Irreversible"), whose framing and sensitive color schemes are impeccable, and composer Nico Muhly, whose unusual, insinuating work significantly augments the drama and psychological shadings.

The horror of the bourgeoisie can only be overcome by more horror." So said the solemn hippie cannibals of Jean-Luc Godard 's Weekend . And so it is with George Ratliff 's Joshua , a nifty psychological thrillerpart Bad Seed , part Rosemary's Baby that deals in a manner both comic and creepy with the parental anxieties of a Manhattan haute yuppie family.

The birth of a baby triggers the tale. Mom (Vera Farmiga ) and Dad (Sam Rockwell ) are both severely stressedshe's a neurotic harridan, he's a happy-go-lucky hysteric. These parents are like kids themselves, while their nine-year-old son Joshua (Jacob Kogan ) is a parody adultstiff, unsmiling, always dressed in his private-school blazer and tie, curiously morbid, and alienated to the point of autism. "Do you ever feel weird, Dad?" he asks. "How do you feel about your weird son?" Weirdness is compounded by the supporting in-laws: Mom's bizarrely cheerful gay brother (Dallas Roberts ) and Dad's stridently born-again mother (Celia Weston ).
Young Josh is a compulsive piano-player, and his pounding at the keyboard sets the mood the way that "cool ghoul" John Zacherley  did on the old TV show Chiller Theater . Josh's musical career peaks at a maliciously rendered private-school recital; his rendition of "Twinkle Twinkle" goes clamorously atonal before passing into performance art of an ominously visceral nature. Josh, who has a disquieting habit of just appearing, develops some strange nocturnal patterns, staying up all night watching home videos of his colicky baby self. This, just as the newbie goes on a five-day crying jag. Mom, who is already expressing her milk because of nursing difficulties, does not react well.
Ratliff renders this all with a suitably queasy visual style, using a wide-angle lens to deform the apartment space and further maul Farmiga's drawn features. As she gets crazier, so does her son resolving to give away all his toys and embalm his pet panda. What with the strange noises emanating from the empty apartment upstairs, it's hard to tell who is the most disturbed member of the family although it's understandable that Dad freaks out at the fate of the pet dog. Around the time Mom starts to hallucinate things coming through the ceiling, Grandma moves back in, announcing that Josh has found Jesus. "Too bad that his mother is a big fat Jew!" Mom screams, introducing a bit of religious conflict that remains tantalizingly underexplored.
So far, so goodfor all the craziness, Joshua   is still based largely on the power of suggestion and caginess as to which character is actually having the breakdown. But as Dad's hair grows progressively wilder and his speech less coherent, so does the narrative. Ratliff lost me with the introduction of a child psychologist who makes house calls and snap diagnoses. Still, it's refreshing to see a horror film based on adult anxieties: The terror of the baby cam can only be overcome by more terror.
