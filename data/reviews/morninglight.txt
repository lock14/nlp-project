After seeing "Morning Light," a fluffy piece of Disney nonfiction about the one woman and 10 men who competed last year in a yacht race across the Pacific, I have some questions. Is anyone thinking about turning this into a reality competition show ("The Amazing Race on Water")? More seriously: Why, after all this training footage, don't we learn what actually makes a good sailor?
The idea to invite untested mariners into the Transpacific Yacht Race, or Transpac, comes from Roy Disney, one of Walt's kids and a Transpac veteran. Soon after he explains the idea of a nationwide search for young sailing enthusiasts, the movie counts down to the start of the two-week, 2,300-mile offshore race. And as the clock in the upper left corner of the screen ticked away the remaining pre-race training time, I started to panic. Have these kids, mostly amateur racers, really learned enough to beat the boat of professionals they'll be up against? Probably, but we never get a useful sense of what that knowledge entails.
When the final crew is set, they all seem the same, temperamentally and physically. The sun appears to have bleached just about everybody blond; the Australian captain is recognizable insofar as he sounds Australian and captainy. But we get little explanation in the way of tactics or technique, and the filmmakers have compressed time into a bunch of cuts and platitudes about how the race will change the competitors' lives. The kids are all smart and seem nice enough; a few are students at Rhode Island schools. But except for title cards that catch us up at the end, they're barely individuated.
The lone woman in the race, Genny Tulloch, has to endure the boys' playful taunts. But interestingly, her participation forces her teammates to contemplate how strange and lonely she might feel. The personal journal entries she reads as narration only touch on how weird two weeks under those circumstances might be for her. Judging from her nonchalance, it's no big deal.
A more crucial mystery is what criteria were used to select the racers, particularly Steve Manson, a virtual orphan from Baltimore, who happens to be the lone African-American on the crew. The film flashes back to certain teammates' selection interviews; we see that Manson isn't much of a swimmer. He makes the cut anyway, but for the rest of the training months you're forced, again, to wonder how.
His inclusion has the whiff of tokenism. It's not until that blitz of who's-doing-what information at the end that we know just how nautically gifted Manson even is. While we're watching flavorless dramas about Ernie Davis ("The Express"), we could be seeing real eye-openers about guys like Manson. Steve, have you sold Disney the rights to your story?


 In “Morning Light,” a sweepingly beautiful documentary unmoored by democratic intentions, 15 amateur sailors prepare to cross more than 2,000 miles of Pacific Ocean in the race known as the Transpac.  The Kentucky Derby of open-sea racing, the biennial Transpac is a grueling, exhilarating haul from Los Angeles to Honolulu and a daunting prospect for novices. Ranging in age from 18 to 23 and with varying degrees of experience, the 15 hopefuls — who will eventually be winnowed to a crew of 11 for the sloop Morning Light — endure months of rigorous training, soggy sleeping quarters and lots of throwing up. They couldn’t be more thrilled.  Yet for all its sparkling seascapes and shiny, happy faces, “Morning Light” is sunny-side-up filmmaking that sacrifices dramatic focus for generic observations on teamwork and character building. The writer and director, Mark Monroe, could have shaped his adventurous material in any number of ways to engage nonsailors, including highlighting gender issues (an intriguingly chauvinistic conversation conducted in the absence of the crew’s sole female member is abruptly cut short) or exploring the feelings of the four rejectees.  Instead he allows his appealing young subjects to blend into a single, relentlessly upbeat personality. Like the disastrously overpopulated “Amazing Race: Family Edition,” “Morning Light” never finds a way to make us care who wins.  “Morning Light” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). One broken arm and several shattered dreams.

Roy E. Disney has sailed the Transpac 16 times. In "Morning Light," he passes the baton, documenting a team of young mariners as they attempt to win the open-sea race. It's easy to see how the harrowing 2,500-mile trek from California to Hawaii might have been a life-changing event for Disney and fellow producer Leslie DeMeuse, although the film feels more like the ultimate scrapbook for the participants than the vicarious thrill the pair no doubt imagined for audiences. Of course, Uncle Walt made his share of square nonfiction programs, too ("Tomorrowland," "True-Life Adventures"), some of which remain classics today.
The obstacle isn't so much the subject matter -- though the race offers neither the drama nor the outcome the producers werehoping for -- as the cast. Disney seems excited by the concept of entrusting such a voyage to a crew of 18- to 23-year-olds, but it's hard to imagine audiences finding much to identify with here, when none of these J. Crew types appears ever to have dealt with anything worse than a case of sunburn.
The documentary begins with two girls and a lone black guy in the mix, but only one of them makes the final cut (when 11 of the 15 candidates featured are selected to make the trip). These are hardly everyday kids plucked off the streets, but rather the experienced spawn of whitebread sailing families, born with salt water in their veins; the subtext strongly implies sailing is a sport you're born into.
And rather than singling out one or two compelling individuals and telling the story through their eyes, editor Paul Crowder attempts to give everyone a fair amount of screen time, ensuring relatively shallow portrayals all around.
Everything is "sick," "sweet" or "unreal," according to the young sailors, who sound considerably more eloquent when delivering the confessional-style interviews that serve as the film's narration throughout. And though narrator Patrick Warburton lays out the trip's life-and-death stakes in a booming prologue, the team's poignant rite of passage isn't exactly reflected in their casual chatter. (Doing without pizza and music for 11 days? Big deal.)
More impressive than anything that unfolds onboard is the daunting task of documenting this voyage on the open seas. While stationary and handheld cameras record the more intimate dynamics above and below deck, the truly breathtaking footage was captured either by helicopter (near land) or from a chase boat fast enough to keep pace with the film's eponymous TP52 sloop.
The Transpac race itself doesn't start until nearly halfway through the film, after everyone has undergone safety training, but the excitement certainly picks up once they're on their way. Overhead maps and fancy computer-generated shots help audiences follow their progress. A patch without wind makes things interesting, as does one surprise shot when the camera looks out over the stern to reveal rival TP52 Samba Pa Ti just behind, as Morning Light takes the lead over a team of experienced pros.
Crowder uses familiar reality-TV tricks -- rapidly cutting, zooming and speeding up footage --�to supply artificial energy, but it's telling that an 11-day sailing adventure doesn't even condense to an hour's worth of white-knuckle screen time. The right music might have elevated the entire package (consider "Chariots of Fire"), but "Morning Light's" score is fairly standard, and an end-credits song by three team members suggests these kids should stick to sailing. The sound team works wonders with audio that surely took a worse beating than the boat itself.


Two unnerving phenomena—the popularity of reality-TV competitions and the Walt Disney Company 's ability to churn out entertainment starring the most squeaky-clean humans on earth—come together in Morning Light , a nightmarishly upbeat documentary about a group of young people who face off with the world's best sailors in a 2,500-mile boat race from Long Beach  to Hawaii . Under the watchful eye of Disney exec Roy E. Disney , 15 hand-selected college-aged seafarers train for the annual Transpacific Yacht Race, eventually deciding among themselves who will make up the final crew of 11. The movie's first half consists of typical America's Next Top Model  –type rigmarole where we're forced to hear every contestant's backstory—although here, no one's a closet lesbian or anorexic. Once the crew is selected, things improve somewhat, as director Mark Monroe  shifts his attention to the race, treating the audience to one gorgeous panoramic shot of the Pacific Ocean  after another. But no matter how many times these young adults insist that this grueling competition is changing their lives, Morning Light  strenuously ignores the obvious emotional and physical toll, playing up the gosh-darn fun factor until the participants feel like cogs in the film's inspiration machine. These kids survive their adventure on the high seas, but escaping the powerful Disney agenda is another matter entirely.
