Inexplicable Fantasy Romances for the Harried Modern Gal 101 is a more fitting title for this shameless mediocrity, although you'd likely lose no points for comparing it to kissing cousin Pretty Woman
, which operated in the same fantastical universe where prostitutes and gigolos arrive without medical documentation but baring blazingly white choppers and butts to die for. Where is this miraculous parallel universe, anyway, and why hasn't Stan Lee capitalized on it yet? Will & Grace
's Messing plays Kat Ellis, who, in the film's exceedingly quick set-up, scours the NYC positions-wanted advertisements for a male escort to accompany her to her sister's wedding in England, with the aim of making her ex-boyfriend jealous enough to take her back. She succeeds, sight unseen, in netting Mulroney's Nick Mercer, a professional love machine with savoir faire to spare who's also prone to offering up pearls of Yoda-istic relationship advice unbidden. Any reasonable woman would smack this smarmy clown clean off the block and grab the nearest pizza delivery guy or bohemian-in-residence in lieu of such a gormless wonder, but not Kat, who's still so broken up over her previous dumping that she's clearly not thinking straight. Once in jolly old England, the script, courtesy of newcomer Dana Fox, takes off in all directions, with familial intrigue, randy British best friends, and the hard, hard lessons of love undone in the face of Mulroney's chiseled abs 'n' bum technique. It will catch no one but sleeping infants by surprise when Kat begins to fall for the professional, and vice versa. The only question is how and when will it be most inconvenient, and that's accomplished by lifting what feels like whole chunks of plot maneuverings from the battered (and frankly better) backstories book of Richard Curtis, the screenwriter behind Four Weddings and a Funeral
, Notting Hill
, and Bridget Jones's Diary
, any one of which has an easier way with the audience's suspension of disbelief than this disastrous date. Even Curtis' recent Love Actually
 (a film so overstuffed with Brit-wit-twittery as to be nearly as dangerous to one's heart-health as a fistful of Cornish pastries followed by a Arsenal hooligan chaser) had a modicum of sappy charm, not to mention some tangled storylines that, even at their most unlikely, ached to be real, or at least as real as a film featuring Billy Bob Thornton as a libidinous Yank president can be. Kilner, alas, has little of Curtis' rampant fictional-people skills, and so Messing and Mulroney, who have precious little chemistry between them (he's as stoically stodgy as Hugh Grant awaiting a colonoscopy but far less interesting to look at), find themselves adrift in a sea of oddball relations, late-night make-out sessions that have all the erotic heat of a 1970s-era Tampax commercial, and last-minute revelations that seem forced beyond measure. And then there's that whole Dreamy Male Gigolo thing. It's enough to make you wish Lou Reed would take up screenwriting.


There are exactly two good moments in ''The Wedding Date." One lasts two seconds and is unprintable. The other happens when the male escort hired by the movie's addled heroine informs her that she owes him an additional fee for services that may have been rendered the night before.
Since she was drunk, she doesn't remember. And because he's falling in love with her, he's hurt. So he demands payment, which she finds outrageous. ''Seventeen hundred dollars
? That's a down payment on a Ford Focus!"
The woman delivering the line is Debra Messing, a comedian who does this sort of thing (fevered zingers, stark-raving neurosis) weekly on ''Will & Grace." When her show is in shape, Messing's the funniest woman on television: a lunatic cross-breeding of Lucille Ball and Rosalind Russell. Her character is inconsistent: Is Grace a pathetic dingbat or the modern woman misunderstood? But Messing is a virtuoso at banter and slapstick.
Her most embarrassing moments on that show are the earnest, teary ones. And ''The Wedding Date" is composed almost exclusively of those. Messing plays Kat Ellis, one of those super-successful New York women with slumping love lives whom movies love to torture. For her sister's wedding, Kat hires Nick, whom Dermot Mulroney inhabits with an understandable lack of interest: He's playing cardboard. They meet on the plane, head over to London, where her family lives, and plunge into the inevitable.
Kat's sister, Amy (Amy Adams), has allowed Kat's ex-fiance, Jeffrey (Jeremy Sheffield), to be her groom's best man. Kat is the maid of honor, and she spends most of her time using her new man to make her old one jealous. Eventually, we're dragged through a soap-opera plot twist that confirms what many will already suspect: These people are stupid.
Well, Nick is not. He was a comparative literature major at Brown, which may account for why he sounds so stoned. It might also explain why he just hangs out here, stranded, like someone dropped him out of a Jane Austen book: Kat will come around and realize he's the one. He and her stepfather (Peter Egan) give Kat loads of advice about how she's her own worst enemy: ''Every woman has the exact love life she wants," she's told in one of the film's many maudlin moments. Mom, for the record, is played by the redoubtable Holland Taylor, who seems boozy even when all she's swilling is ginger ale.
Not much else about ''The Wedding Date" is fun. It's decidedly sub-Aniston, as in so blah not even the star of ''Picture Perfect" or ''The Object of My Affection" would have bothered. Director Clare Kilner seems to prefer clumsily assembled montages pasted to bad pop songs over actual storytelling: The first 10 minutes are devoted to Kat's packing for the UK and various dull helicopter shots of Manhattan, while on the soundtrack The Corrs' ''Breathless" mewls unforgivably around her. It's the same lazy strategy Kilner used to bloat the length of her last inept movie, the Mandy Moore vehicle ''How to Deal."
''The Wedding Date" is adapted from a steaming pile of chick lit called ''Asking for Trouble" and plays it all with a straight face. The cast seems discouraged from doing anything witty or madcap -- especially the movie's star, who looks lost, ordinary, and more than a little sorry. Messing should know this is precisely the kind of movie Grace would ridicule Will for dragging her to see.


         In "The Wedding Date," Dermot Mulroney plays an escort hired by an insecure New Yorker to squire her to her sister's wedding and act as if he's in love. Debra Messing plays the free-spending john, so it follows that Nick is no ordinary hooker— he's a hooker with a degree in comparative literature from Brown.
 
  Had Chekhov written "The Wedding Date," an Ivy League semiotician introduced in the first act would have certainly deconstructed something in the third. (The movie's basic premise, perhaps?) But "The Wedding Date" was adapted by first-time screenwriter Dana Fox, and director Clare Kilner barely takes it past the 10-second pitch stage. ("She hires an escort to pretend to be her boyfriend, and they live happily ever after!") Nick's academic bona fides are not the only detail in "The Wedding Date" that turns out to be purely decorative. Even the central idea is beside the point. No sooner has the movie established that Nick dates women for money than it seems to recoil from the very idea, strewing wisdom, benevolence and accomplishments in his general direction as it slowly backs away.
 


         






    Clearly, Nick is a sex worker of the highest caliber. He's a listener, a "healer," a ripped Dr. Phil with hair. He probably belongs to a union and enjoys full benefits. Obviously, he's never hesitated before a daunting row of forks in his life. For all anybody knows, he's licensed. So Kat, like the rest of her family — shallow mom Bunny (Holland Taylor), dear old dad Victor (Peter Egan) and emotional black hole of a half-sister Amy (Amy Adams) — is smitten at first sight. In fact, all who meet Nick seem to adopt him as counselor and sage. ("You're like the Yoda of escorts!" Kat gushes.) It's a shame he's too busy life-coaching Kat throughout the movie to get academic on her, though. Of all the throwaway details in "The Wedding Date," the idea that a lonely, insecure woman in her mid-30s would defund her 401(k) to pay a pro to pretend to love her seems like the one most in need of a deconstruction.
 
  Once Kat's squirrelly ex-fiancé, Jeffrey (Jeremy Sheffield), has been duly threatened by Nick's charm and low body fat, and Kat's plan appears to have succeeded brilliantly, the absence of an actual plot really turns glaring. For instance, does Kat want to win Jeffrey back, or has she given herself over to the idea of dating an escort? When that 
becomes clear, it gets hard to discern what the obstacles to their happiness are, exactly — or why happiness is set up as the natural outcome of this scenario at all. Except that "The Wedding Date" is regulation rom com at its most limp and disheartening, and the heroine must 
get her guy in the end, even if it does require multiple withdrawals at the ATM. (Nick charges extra for sex.)
 
  It's emblematic of the general confusion that rules "The Wedding Date" that the morning after Kat's big seduction, Nick discovers the money and takes offense at the fact that she intended to pay him, and at the fact that it's less than he normally makes.
 
  What is 
the point of making the single girl's wedding date a prostitute — a potentially satirical, wickedly subversive premise — if he's going to be a prig about it? It would be one thing if "The Wedding Date" wanted to float the notion that you can
 buy me love, but it doesn't at all. What it really wants is to function as a heartwarming, wish-fulfilling fantasy for single girls forced to suffer the indignity of attending their younger sisters' weddings; the jaded girl's Jane Austen.
 
  The more "The Wedding Date" elevates Nick to super-strumpet status, the more it makes Kat — who didn't exactly start out as a jaunty, self-sufficient Katharine Hepburn type — look like the woman with the lowest standards in all of Christendom.
 
  Mulroney is no stranger to the slow-moving hunk role, and he's played it both straight (in "My Best Friend's Wedding") and for laughs (in "About Schmidt"). But here he seems as bewildered as the normally ebullient and physically gifted Messing, whose familiar screwball neurotic persona has been dialed down to just plain neurotic.
 
  How does Kat feel about falling in love with a high-priced escort? What prompts Nick's lightning-bolt conversion to unpaid monogamy? What kind of work can a former comp lit major expect to find in the real world? These and other questions are left unanswered, as the movie doesn't even pretend to be governed by any internal logic. Even light entertainment has to entertain a worldview, and by contorting itself to avoid saying anything remotely real about its inherently dark subject matter, "The Wedding Date" winds up an oddly depressing, lost, little movie that eventually caves in on itself.
 
  I never thought I'd hold "Pretty Woman" up as a standard, but "The Wedding Date" eagerly invites the comparison. And "Hot Dude" it's not.

It's not enough to dub The Wedding Date  a kind of Pretty Man , in honor of the studly escort (Dermot Mulroney) rented by a neurotic yet practical single woman (Debra Messing) in New York to be her arm candy at what she anticipates will be a hellish family gathering in London. So many body parts from other engineered romantic comedies have been crudely harvested and stitched together in the making of this weird robotic lark that Maid of Honor of Frankenstein might be more useful a nickname.
From Pretty Woman  comes the popularly hypocritical middle-American fantasy of a hooker-who-looks-like-a-movie-star, with Mulroney, suave in a tuxedo and (as the camera leers at his butt) even suaver in the altogether, as a man who rents himself out to ladies in need.
In this case, the employer is Messing's Kat, who dreads showing up solo at the wedding of her princessy half-sister, Amy (Amy Adams), especially since Kat's caddish ex-beau (Jeremy Sheffield) is the best man. From Four Weddings and a Funeral  and Notting Hill , there's the jolly, phony-as-Madonna's-accent Anglophilia, created by American first-time screenwriter Dana Fox and British director Clare Kilner. In this instance, frightfully sophisticated and ch-ch-charming Brits (i.e., Amy's dim but gentlemanly intended and his mates) embrace their Yank counterparts for games of cricket, pub crawling, and parties held in country houses out of Howards End .
From Maid in Manhattan , with its stultifying lack of chemistry between Ralph Fiennes and Jennifer Lopez, comes the fizzle between Mulroney and Messing  the former a relaxed movie actor (himself filched from My Best Friend's Wedding ) whose rugged masculinity fails to relax Messing's usually more delightful, tightly wound persona.
The Wedding Date  proceeds as prescripted as marriage vows; the studio-sealed happy ending is in sight from the first frame. And even though the comedy flirts with modern gender reversal  Kat is the buyer, Nick is the goods  the movie's numbingly conventional mind-set is also never in doubt: Having purchased the pleasure of his company like a grown sexual woman, Kat becomes a giggly little girl in a flannel nightie when it comes time for bed and the possibility of S-E-X. At least Richard Gere knew what to do with Julia Roberts when Edward met Vivian.

am willing to bet money that the director Clare Kilner adored "Four Weddings and a Funeral." Either she or Dana Fox, a screenwriter, must have a serious soft spot for that movie, because their new romantic comedy, "The Wedding Date," struggles from beginning to end to capture the charm and ebullience of "Four Weddings," Mike Newell's 1994 film about bad timing and a British-American romance. The new movie's effort is mostly unsuccessful, but there are bright spots. Debra Messing stars as Kat Ellis, a good-looking New Yorker with half a dozen pieces of good-looking matched luggage, whose younger half sister has the nerve to be marrying first. The ceremony is in London, where their blended British-American family lives, and the groom's best man is Kat's former fianc�, who broke off the engagement. (The exposition begins immediately, with the heroine sharing information with the bicycle messenger at her door.) Naturally, Kat has to show up with some fabulous guy, and since there is no such man in her life she turns to the classified ads for "male escorts." Now the film turns into a gender-reversed "Pretty Woman." That film posited the notion that a businessman might hire a Los Angeles streetwalker with the looks, charm and self-possession of Julia Roberts. "The Wedding Date" suggests that a woman could pick a male prostitute out of a newspaper ad and have him turn out to be a hunk with beautiful manners and a degree in comparative literature from Brown University. Seriously. I missed the part where Dermot Mulroney became a sex symbol (in "My Best Friend's Wedding," it was never clear why either Ms. Roberts or Cameron Diaz wanted him so much), but as Nick Mercer, one of those film characters who know everything and are never flustered or unsure, he is highly appealing. This can't be easy, because he is given ridiculous behavior, like the aggressive parading-around-naked-in-the-bathroom scene (although the $6,000 Kat paid him, from her 401-K, does not include sex), and aphorisms that don't quite deliver. "Look people in the eye," Nick tells Kat. "They'll never know what you're wearing." Ms. Messing, best known as the increasingly wacky interior designer Grace Adler in NBC's sitcom "Will and Grace," manages to keep her dignity too, sometimes by deliberately losing it. When she wakes up on the plane at the end of the flight to London, she actually looks like someone who has slept all night, fitfully, in an airline seat. During most of the film, though, she is striking, glamorous and beautifully dressed, like the rest of the cast. Holland Taylor, who has carved out a film and television niche as the quintessential affluent mom of a certain age, is appealingly brittle as Kat's mother. Sarah Parish, as T. J., a British cousin, fills the role of the humorously blunt relative nicely. As Amy, the self-involved blond bride, Amy Adams is suitably unlikable, prone to icky comments like "You're my half sister, but I whole love you." Her groom (Jack Davenport) and Kat's ex-fianc� (Jeremy Sheffield) don't have much to do until the big happiness-threatening secret is revealed near the end. The scenery is equally good-looking. After the rowdy bachelor and bachelorette parties in London, everyone heads for the glorious English countryside for family-bonding activities, most notably an amateur game of rounders; solemn, plot-advancing talks inside a boathouse beside a poetry-worthy lake; and the actual wedding at the perfect old country church. "The Wedding Date" proves that there is nothing inherently magical about a group of adults frolicking on a lawn with an old pop-music hit in the background. But the various scenes' charms would be far more enjoyable if the movie weren't so in love with its own supposed cuteness. "The Wedding Date" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has four-letter words, sexual discussions and situations, brief partial nudity and an innocuous attempt at a fistfight.

An intriguingly racy premise -- a woman hires a top-of-the-line male escort to pose as her significant other -- plays out to listless, unsatisfying effect in "The Wedding Date." Long hailed as the heiress apparent to Lucille Ball for her work on "Will & Grace," Debra Messing is clearly being primed here for the sort of romantic-comedy stardom lavished on Julia Roberts. Yet while comparisons to the similarly hooker-themed "Pretty Woman" are inevitable, perhaps even intended, this wan Universal release looks unlikely to match that pic's B.O. returns or infectious crowd-pleaser status.
Originally conceived under the much better title "Something Borrowed," this adaptation of Elizabeth Young's novel "Asking for Trouble" starts with a classic opposites-attract scenario. Anxious, high-strung Kat Ellis (Messing) desperately forks over a plane ticket so that devastatingly slick Nick Mercer (Dermot Mulroney), reputedly one of the smoothest operators in New York, can accompany her to London for her sister's impending nuptials, passing himself off as her boyfriend.
A Yank black sheep who hasn't seen her Blighty-based family in two years, Kat hopes to make a good impression on her critical mother, Bunny (Holland Taylor); her voice-of-sanity father, Victor (Peter Egan); and her competitive half-sister, Amy (Amy Adams), who is about to wed Edward (Jack Davenport). She's also dying to save face in front of her ex-boyfriend, Jeffrey (Jeremy Sheffield), who just so happens to be the best man -- and possibly make him jealous.
The happy recipient of $6,000 cash, Nick plays along with the charade, pretending to be a therapist and turning on the charm full force. While he draws the line at sex (that, he warns, will cost extra), he thinks nothing of parading in front of Kat stark naked, or of dispensing advice on how to loosen up, or whispering sweet nothings to beef up her self-esteem. In short, he's the perfect guy to save her from her twitchy, self-conscious, neurotically over-apologetic self.
It sounds nice on paper, but as laid out in Dana Fox's meandering screenplay, this business-arrangement-turned-real-deal unfolds with a lack of focus and energy. Kat is a too-inconsistent comic creation -- wary and prudish one second, breezy and reckless the next -- and Messing's likable but uneven perf is a series of individually appealing moments that don't always connect. Mulroney comes off as a touch aloof, as though vaguely bored.
It's not that Messing and Mulroney lack chemistry so much as the fact that Fox and helmer Clare Kilner, misjudge their storytelling priorities. They lavish too much time on a subplot involving the sleazy Jeffrey, who is floated as a possible rival for Kat's affections (with Sheffield's improbable charm at odds with the way the character is written). Key plot points, like the couple's consummation of their relationship and the subsequent emotional fallout, are introduced and then dropped without explanation.
And aside from one predictable scene where Kat lashes out at the sleaziness of Nick's profession, pic doesn't explore, as "Pretty Woman" did, either the tensions or the comic possibilities of embarking on an actual relationship with a paid prostitute. Instead, the story veers into a series of melodramatic third-act revelations that assume a deeper investment in the peripheral characters than most auds will be prepared to make.
Clocking in at just under 90 minutes, "Date" feels trimmed down to its bare bones at the frequent expense of logic and narrative clarity. Even the talented ensemble feels under-utilized, especially Egan and Holland as Kat's parents and Sarah Parish, raucous in the role of Kat's bawdy chum, TJ.
Tech contributions are more than adequate, with cinematographer Oliver Curtis tackling the bright lights of London and the city's more rural surroundings in classy, low-key fashion. Pop soundtrack, however, is a bland mix, lurching from one ill-placed tune to the next in an attempt to underline emotions that haven't been filled in onscreen.

Calling all Derridettes: The headiest movie in the annual "Film Comment Selects" is surely The Ister , a three-hour Australian cine-essay inspired by Martin Heidegger 's 1942 lecture course on the 19th-century German poet Friedrich Hölderlin 's Danubian ode.
David Barison  and Daniel Ross 's digital-video doc travels upriver past presidential visitations (Romania ), bombed bridges (Serbia ), Stalin-era steelworks (Hungary ), Nazi concentration camps (Mauthausen ), and mock classical temples (Bavaria ) to the heart of darkness, the Black Forest cabin where Heidegger wrote Being and Time . There is evidently a German term for aquatic road movieswasserstrasse but The Ister  also offers a stream of consciousness. Three philosophers, including onetime bank robber Bernard Stiegler , and filmmaker Hans-Jürgen Syberberg  provide commentary on Greek myths, European history, and Heidegger's theory of agribusiness.
You may wonder if the humble DV mini-cam is the technology that enframes the river's essence. Indeed, the onrushing landscape, however despoiled, is a Bazinian counterpoint to the babbling brook of Heideggerian seinundzeitis . The movie's single Sunday-afternoon screening will be followed by a panel discussion.
