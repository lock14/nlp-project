Hayseed comedy has a good, long tradition in America, from Mark Twain to Ma and Pa Kettle to "Hee Haw" to the "Ernest" movies. So why do we get stuck with Larry the Cable Guy?
True, beating up on Larry's new movie, the aptly titled "Witless Protection," is just too easy. It's a slapstick B-programmer aimed not at pointy-headed big-city movie critics but at folks who like their comedy proudly unsophisticated - the audiences who've followed the star from his roots in the redneck comedy circuit. When someone icily tells Larry "Your attempts at humor are feeble, juvenile, and bigoted," well, that's the pig call the target demographic has been waiting to hear.
"Witless" finds our hero cast as Larry, a dim-bulb but good-hearted deputy sheriff in rural nowheresville who sees a pretty woman escorted by some men in black and immediately assumes she's being kidnapped. They're the FBI, actually, and they're taking star witness Madeleine (Ivana Milicevic) to Chicago for the trial of her former lover and boss, an Enronesque white-collar villain. Larry kidnaps her from the Feds and quickly becomes convinced they're on the side of the bad guys. Cue a long, dingy road trip to the Windy City. "It Happened One Night" this ain't. Actually, a Don Knotts movie this ain't.
It's mostly harmless dum-dum stuff, though. Larry will make an innocently naughty malapropism - fleeing the agents, he'll say "I'm trying to make a flawless ejaculation" - and then break wind. The oddest thing about "Witless Protection" is its apparent random casting. Peter Stormare, a veteran of "Fargo" among other off-Hollywood films, plays the villain with an extremely peculiar Dutch-British accent. Wandering over from David Mamet-land is Joe Mantegna as a mincing Dr. Feelgood.
Jenny McCarthy gets a few scenes in Daisy Dukes as Larry's waitress girlfriend and Eric Roberts turns up as a lethal security man. And there's Yaphet Kotto, recycling his FBI agent suit and his character name from "Midnight Run." Those big, wise eyes have never looked sadder.
They all take a back seat to Larry - real name Dan Whitney - a pretty smart guy, who under the trucker cap and sweat-stained cutoff shirt, has realized there's money to be made pandering to the humor and prejudices of white, undereducated Middle Americans. The otherwise genial "Witless Protection" scrapes bottom whenever a black person or an Asian or an Arab is wheeled on for just-kiddin' laughs. "Yer a funny little feller," says Larry after threatening a Muslim motel owner with deportation to Guantanamo Bay. And Larry? You're a big ugly racist.



If you need a GPS unit to find your own backside, you�ll be laughing uproariously at �Witless Protection,� a movie that�s far more interesting politically than dramatically -- or, God knows, comically. Pic opened below expectations to $2.2 million, likely drawing primarily on the 20% or so of Americans who still approve of President George W. Bush, which seems to be its target audience given the Muslim jokes, black jokes, liberal jokes, swipes at minority Homeland Security employees and such sparkling analogies as �quicker than Angelina Jolie adopting jungle pygmies.�
There�s an air of desperation surrounding this outing by Larry the Cable Guy, none of whose previous efforts at bigscreen blue-collar comedy (�Delta Farce,� �Larry the Cable Guy: Health Inspector�) had quite the nasty edge of �Witless Protection.� Not only is Deputy Larry Stalder the comedian�s stupidest creation, he�s easily the most bilious. That he�s boorish, crude and disgusting goes without saying. That he threatens a Muslim motel clerk with �Gitmo,� or tells a character played by Yaphet Kotto to �come over from the dark side,� pushes �Witless� into a new realm for LCG: He�s repulsive, of course, but unlikeable, too.
When Deputy Larry spots Madeleine Dimkowksi -- note the combo slur of her last name -- being escorted through his burg by a team of FBI agents, he immediately jumps to the ridiculous conclusion that�s she�s being kidnapped. So he kidnaps her back. And despite her protests, he insists that FBI agent Alonzo Moseley (Kotto) is a dirty cop, working for corrupt tycoon Arthur Grimsley (Peter Stormare), against whom Madeleine is supposed to testify. That Larry turns out to be right is just one of many insulting things thrust upon the audience.
There�s a weird, reactionary cultural subtext going on in �Witless,� wherein everything that smells of progressive or even remotely artistic is automatically deemed malevolent. Madeleine (played by Ivana Milicevic) will eventually come around to finding something charming in Larry, but consider her cell phone�s ring tone: Beethoven. Moseley�s plays Wagner. Larry�s plays the theme to �Green Acres.� Guess who�s the good guy?
Jenny McCarthy, a talented comedienne ordinarily, has the very dubious honor of playing Larry�s girlfriend Connie, whom he treats to the usual litany of chauvinistic asides, anatomical references, jokes about sex acts and what seems to be a general acceptance of female inscrutability and dumb-bunny-dom. As ridiculous as McCarthy�s character is, it�s nothing compared to the mad scientist played by Joe Mantegna, whose presence here is utterly inexplicable; it�s as if someone were holding his children hostage.
One can only hope that �Witless Protection� is targeted at a vanishing species of American Neanderthal. In the meantime, perhaps Larry and his accomplices at Lionsgate could take some sensitivity traning.
