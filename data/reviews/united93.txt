This time we can’t comfort ourselves with the words “It’s only a movie.” Foreknowledge of the horrible reality of Sept. 11, 2001, makes United 93 a tough proposition for some viewers who are fearful of revisiting the emotions of that day. However, it would be misguided to fear this film as Hollywood’s brazen exploitation of a national tragedy for selfish popcorn profits. United 93 is a sober, humanistic portrait of America’s literal “first responders” – the passengers on the only flight that failed to reach its target on 9/11 because in-flight phone calls to loved ones on the ground provided them with information about the already successful attacks and spurred the quick understanding that the aircraft they were aboard had become the instant front line of an unprecedented battleground. While taking nothing away from the courage and quick thinking of the doomed passengers, United 93 refrains from turning them into heroes in the service of rousing national spirit in the manner of many of our politicians, who have used these collective individuals as exemplars of American might and retaliation. United 93 was made with the support of the families of the deceased, who, among other things, helped the filmmakers learn something of their final conversations with loved ones. Nevertheless, everything that occurred on Flight 93 is conjecture of some sort. What writer-director Greengrass captures better than any other speculation I’ve seen is the sense of chaos and panic that must have overtaken the passengers. What we witness is not so much an organized counter-attack as a panicked, last-ditch attempt at self-preservation. Survival rather than nationalism is the instinct at work here, and the film’s hand-held camerawork enhances our sense of the fragmented chaos. We have watched as these travelers pass the time at the airport waiting to board the plane and engage in the kind of chit-chat that travelers do. Their ordinariness increases that horrible “it could have been me” feeling that we’ve all been subject to. The film unfolds in more or less real time (the flight lasted 91 minutes) as we see how little time these people had to grasp the import of their circumstances – no less, devise a plan of action. (Even the much-heralded words “Let’s roll” are used as part of a sentence rather than a rallying cry.) A good chunk of the film’s first hour is devoted to watching the workings of the various air-traffic control towers and agencies as they struggle to gain an understanding of the events that are occurring in front of their eyes as airplane blips suddenly disappear from their radar screens. We are also witness to instances of communications failures among the various towers and agencies as everyone scrambles to comprehend the events and act on their specific mandates. Without dwelling on the subject, Greengrass indicts this aspect of the American defense. Instead of using actors, Greengrass employed many of the actual air-traffic controllers and military commanders who were on the ground that day. Also aiding his film’s universality is Greengrass’ use of little known actors in the central roles, preventing stardom from affecting our ideas about heroism and patriotism. Even though the story told in United 93 is quite specific, the film’s focus on the confusion and incomprehension makes it the story of all Americans. Each of us has a story to tell of where we were or how we heard the news on 9/11. And, for the most part, they are stories of the individual struggle to wrap one’s head around something so unfathomable, to wring order from the chaos. This is the sense in which United 93 reflects our universal American experience. The situation on Flight 93 was dire and demanded immediate response, and the rapid process these people went through as they shifted from frightened individuals to aligned activists is a sped-up – and more costly – version of what we’ve all been going through as we struggle to come to terms with the day our world changed.

Is it too soon? Maybe. Probably. But if we're to endure the unimaginable realities of Sept. 11, 2001, retrofitted into a two-hour Hollywood movie, this is the way to do it.
As written and directed by Paul Greengrass, ''United 93" turns out to be a harrowing, honorable, even necessary memorial to the 40 passengers and crew members of the doomed flight -- and to a national innocence that, five years later, seems irretrievably in the past. The movie is hard going, not least in the sense of powerlessness it leaves in an audience that knows exactly what will happen. And yet you come out feeling that the filmmakers have done the right thing by these people, and by this day.
Maybe it's something less rosy than innocence that ''United 93" captures in its opening moments, as sleepy passengers queue up at airport gates and four somber young men slip into line without glancing at each other. There's a heartbreaking naivete to the pilots' banal chitchat, to the lazy cellphone calls of those boarding. We're witnessing the last moments of complacency.
Much of the first half of ''United 93" occurs on the ground, as Greengrass re-creates the slowly growing confusion and panic that enveloped the air traffic control centers of the Northeast. As the title airplane taxies down the runway, a controller in Boston hears a snippet of Arabic and suddenly American Airlines Flight 11 is suspect -- the first of the four planes to go AWOL. But there hasn't been a hijacking since, what, 1990?
Word is passed to New York, and to the National Air Traffic Control Center in Herndon, Va., where newly promoted supervisor Ben Sliney is starting his first day on the job. The Northeast Air Defense Sector in Rome, N.Y., is alerted, too, but since there's a major NORAD exercise off the coast, hardly anyone's minding the store. ''This a sim?" someone asks. ''No -- real world," comes the reply.
These scenes take place in dark, crowded, low-ceilinged rooms filled with dumpy men, many of whom, it turns out, are playing themselves. This is both good for the movie -- the actors' naturalness is welcome, and who'd know better what happened that day? -- and jarring for the audience, as though a role in the inevitable Hollywood version is the proper reward for every survivor.
If there's a hero anywhere on the ground, it's Sliney, and his heroism takes the form of simply thinking on his feet as American 11 disappears from the radar screens and United 175 drops like a manhole cover and then someone turns on CNN because a small plane has supposedly crashed into one of the Twin Towers and then the second plane hits and everyone in the movie goes terribly silent because the new age is upon us.
The final plane in the air, of course, was United 93, out of Newark and bound for San Francisco; after a struggle between the hijackers and the passengers, it would crash into a rural Pennsylvania field. Greengrass cuts back and forth between the widening shock on the ground to the still-calm flight in the air, but after the first hour he settles in: the hesitant first moves of the terrorist leader (Khalid Abdalla), the slaughter in the cockpit, the chaos as passengers are herded to the rear, calls going out on in-flight phones, bad news coming in, the resolve to do something, anything.
''We need every big guy," someone says, and, thankfully, the scene isn't played for can-do triumphalism, as it was in A&E's version back in January. Even ''Let's roll," the famous line of Todd Beamer (David Alan Basche), is tossed away in the heat of immediacy. I could reel off the names of the actors, but that would be very much beside the point; ''United 93" has been cast for anonymity, and except for John Rothman, the character actor playing passenger Edward Felt, there's not an ''oh, that
 guy" moment in the movie.
Greengrass made ''The Bourne Supremacy," but the relevant item in his filmography is 2002's ''Bloody Sunday," a minute-by-minute re-creation of the 1972 Derry Massacre in Northern Ireland. Like that film, ''United 93" is a muscular retelling that aims for near-documentary verisimilitude. The director does everything in his power to humanize his characters, as opposed to dramatizing them -- and that includes the terrorists some viewers would prefer to see demonized.
The sequence toward the end, as the flight plunges closer to Washington and everyone on board prays to his or her respective god, is the closest to commentary the film comes, and it's pitched halfway between muted irony and a spooky, all-encompassing bereavement. So much died that day, the film implies, that we still haven't buried it all.
Elsewhere, ''United 93" works hard to stay apolitical; viewers hoping for flag-waving on the right, finger-pointing on the left, or all-American martyrdom in the middle will come away disappointed. (As will the lunatic fringe convinced the whole thing was staged, in which case this movie must be part of the government coverup, too. That's the great thing about conspiracy theories -- they're flexible enough to fit any paranoia.) The movie eloquently sets the bar for all subsequent 9/11 stories; one awaits Oliver Stone's ''World Trade Center," due in August, with newly sharpened dread.
The one misstep Greengrass makes -- aside from the European passenger who talks appeasement like an airborne Neville Chamberlain -- is in commissioning John Powell's soundtrack music. Reasonably discreet, the score still gilds the scenes with melodrama by its very presence.
Music isn't needed here. We know what to feel. ''United 93" peels back the political rhetoric and emotional calluses of five years of war and lets us feel it again. Why? Only because people died that day, and because they deserve to be remembered.


         "United 93" is not an easy flight to board. This staggering, draining film is exceptionally accomplished but extremely difficult to watch. It turns out to be easier to admire from whatever distance you can manage than to embrace with any kind of emotional intimacy. This may have been filmmaker Paul Greengrass' intention, but only up to a point.
 
  United 93, a Boeing 757 headed from Newark, N.J., to San Francisco, was the last of four planes hijacked by Islamic terrorists on Sept. 11, 2001. It was also the only one that didn't hit its target, likely the U.S. Capitol building. The flight's 40 passengers and crew, aware of the fate of the three other planes, fought back against their quartet of armed captors. As a result, the big jet crashed with complete loss of life not in Washington, D.C., but on a field near Shanksville, Pa.
 


         






    Though even cockpit voice recorders don't reveal exactly what happened on United 93, Greengrass was intent on getting that story, as well as the surrounding 9/11 drama it informed, as accurate as he could, even at the risk of creating a sense of dread in potential viewers. Greengrass and his team conducted more than 100 face-to-face interviews with the passengers' families and friends as well as key civilian and military personnel.
 
  Working this way is familiar territory for the filmmaker. Known in Hollywood primarily as the director of the successful sequel "The Bourne Supremacy," Greengrass spent a decade as a top British documentarian. And his spectacular "Bloody Sunday" so powerfully conjures up a 1972 day when British troops opened fire on unarmed civil rights marchers in Derry, Northern Ireland, you feel you are there with them, personally experiencing the awful inevitability of history gone wrong.
 
  It's a mark of Greengrass' unequaled gift for believably re-creating reality that, once seen, it's impossible to get "United 93" out of your mind, no matter how much you may want to. Shot by longtime Ken Loach collaborator Barry Ackroyd and strikingly put together by previous Greengrass editors Clare Douglas, Christopher Rouse and Richard Pearson, this film uses second-skin camera placement and rapid, purposeful cutting to convincingly put us inside this complex narrative. This is a film that wrings you out completely, makes you feel you have lived the story along with the participants. Up to a point.
 
  Interestingly enough, "United 93" begins with a close-up of one of the four terrorists, caught in a moment of nervous early morning prayer that ends when a colleague tells him, "It's time."
 
  Then we go to the security line at Newark Airport, where passengers, some of whom are headed for this particular flight, patiently wait. They're ordinary people about to enter history in the most terrible way, about to understand the full import of the celebrated line from the medieval English play "Everyman": "Oh Death, thou comest when I had thee least in mind."
 
  As heavy traffic delays United 93's departure, the film cuts back and forth between the cabin, where the passengers make small talk and the crew deals with the mechanics of preparation, to several air traffic control centers on the East Coast as well as the Federal Aviation Administration's operations command center in Herndon, Va.
 
  With the horror that goes with knowing more than the characters, we watch as the nightmare slowly emerges from its dark lair. First the controllers, then their bosses, then the military operations folks at the Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) realize that not one but several hijackings are taking place simultaneously. Greengrass is especially good at conveying the urgency of individuals desperately playing catch-up with a situation they don't have a prayer of getting out in front of.
 
  Finally, about an hour into the film and after a possible reconsideration by leader Ziad Jarrah (Kahlid Abdalla, like the rest of the quartet an actor based in the U.K.), the United 93 terrorists strike. If you have been dreading these moments of panic, hysteria and violent fanatical rage, they are in truth as horrifying as you've imagined. While no one will ever die again at the World Trade Center or on United 93 (the airline changed the flight number), most of us still go up in airplanes, and that makes these moments especially agitating.
 
  Because theirs is the last plane taken, the passengers on United 93 know, via clandestine phone calls to family and friends, what their fate is likely to be. "This is a suicide mission, we have to do something," one passenger (the film is determined to identify almost no one by name) says. And so a plan to storm the cockpit and try and gain control of their collective fate takes shape.
 
  In addition to the editing and camera techniques he perfected in "Bloody Sunday," Greengrass went to unprecedented lengths to make "United 93" seem as real as possible. Echoing the working methods of Mike Leigh, Greengrass married deep immersion in character with an intense period of improvisation that included having the actors use the two weeks before shooting began to repeatedly improv the entire 91-minute flight in real time.
 
  Greengrass also made sure that none of the dozens of actors used in "Flight 93" had a recognizable face. The performers look so ordinary, in fact, that without specialized knowledge they can't be told apart from one another or from the handful of real people among the controllers and NEADS personnel who play themselves. As if to prove that point, the character who makes the biggest impression in "United 93" is one of those real-life ringers, Ben Sliney, the man who was in charge of the FAA command center.
 
  More than that, while "United 93's" press material includes 26 black-bordered pages of heartfelt biographies of the real flight's passengers and crew written by their survivors, it does not have a single actor bio in it, a first in my experience.
 
  The idea behind all this seems to be the notion of having a group rather than an individual protagonist, of presenting "the people" as a kind of collective hero. This may sound Soviet in derivation but it comes squarely out of British documentary tradition. While its tone is different, "United 93" was likely inspired by a revered British doc few Americans have heard of, Humphrey Jennings' 1943 look at London firemen coping with the Blitz, "Fires Were Started." When a British critic calls "Fires" a "celebration of the courage and dignity of ordinary people working together in the shadow of disaster," he could easily have been describing "United 93."
 
  Intellectually, this is an intriguing approach to an issue that, according to a New York Times article by Jere Longman, who wrote a book on United 93, still divides the survivors, some of whom prefer the group approach while others feel that it slights the handful of individuals whom initial news reports singled out for more heroic roles.
 
  This controversy aside, it is of real value to show what real heroism, not the kind with a glossy face that the movie business specializes in, actually looks like. Interestingly enough, that Hollywood tack was taken by "Flight 93," a made-for-TV broadcast of a few months ago. In a briskly competent, conventional and finally less interesting way, "Flight 93" focuses on individuals and spends considerable time with the families on the ground. Though he hadn't yet seen it, Greengrass was referring to this approach when he wrote of his own work, "It's not a film with neat character arcs."
 
  Emotionally, however, it is hard not to feel that "United 93" may have gone too far in the opposite direction. Exceptional though it is, it plays differently than Greengrass might have expected or intended. The problem is not that the film, which could not possibly be more respectful of the families of the victims, is too close chronologically to a painful event, it's that the event, assorted commissions, inquiries and invasions notwithstanding, remains unresolved in a very particular way. To put it more bluntly, despite ceaseless tough talk from Washington — does anyone outside the Beltway actually feel safer because of the war in Iraq? — we as a nation remain frankly scared.
 
  That fear is part of what makes the horror of what happened on that plane vivid enough to overwhelm the cerebral concept of a group hero. To do more than fill us with dread, to reach us at the deepest emotional level, drama needs well-defined protagonists. "Bloody Sunday," in point of fact, had them, and so did "Fires Were Started." Intellectually, we know we should applaud the marvels "United 93" has accomplished, and we do. But it is a film envisioned as a monument, a memorial tribute, and in our hearts we want something more. "United 93" should have been made now, when memories and passions are still fresh, but it may play better in the future. If we have one.   

Humans are drawn to looking at the unwatchable as a way of cheating death. At least, that's what I told myself to prepare for watching United 93 , a harrowing, documentary-style reenactment, in real time, of what might have happened on the one airplane that didn't fulfill the terrorists' intended goals on Sept. 11, 2001. We willingly look at terrible things, often over and over  real footage of war and dramatizations, actual catastrophes and historical re-creations, the tragic outcomes of which are never in doubt  for the thrill of being alive. Perhaps we're as astonished by our own good fortune as we are horrified by the worse fates of others who could just as well have been us. We grieve, we resolve, we call loved ones, we replay the images, humbled by our own relief.
Movies are the perfect medium for this exercise in gratitude  they always have been, with the screen so big and the audience so huddled together. And the world has never felt more precarious, or the distinctions between the lucky and the unlucky more tenuous, than they did on the day the World Trade Center fell, the Pentagon was attacked, and one Boeing 757 crashed near Shanksville, Pa., diverted by doomed passengers who died yanking control away from their captors' hands.
To his great credit, British writer-director Paul Greengrass knows this, and keeps a cataclysmic story scaled to the vulnerable men and women involved. The result is a movie experience that's undeniably agonizing  but also unexpectedly bracing in ways I couldn't have prepared for. Pulling the bandage of sentiment cleanly away from oozing concepts like ''heroism'' and ''our nation's war on terror'' in the aftermath of recent wounds, here's a drama about the most politically charged crisis of our time that grants the dignity of autonomy to every soul involved. In this telling, each passenger has a life that began long before he or she boarded the aircraft, not a mere representation of citizenry. Each hijacker is a man with a temperament and a religious conviction, not a cartoon monster. Todd Beamer (played by David Alan Basche) utters his now-famous ''Let's roll'' as a brief organizational statement to fellow passengers in on the plans to disarm the terrorists, not as a booming call to patriotism. No wonder so many guys from aviation were willing to play themselves in the re-creation. Perhaps they too wanted to cheat death by revisiting that day of unfathomable national chaos.
It is, indeed, the awesomeness of puny human size that is newest and most riveting about United 93   the way the filmmaker focuses on the ''averageness'' of people who, unlike those who watch and remember some five years later, must scramble to make sense of incomprehensible events in the moment. (Greengrass first got at this shared smallness in Bloody Sunday , his acclaimed 2002 film of the deadly clash between civil rights demonstrators and British troops in Northern Ireland in 1972.) And so, in the beginning, attention moves casually from the prayerful preparations of the hijackers to the routine of morning activity among flight controllers, airplane crew, and the everybodies flying from here to there.
The movie is tightly built, but Greengrass is patient, letting events unfold at the pace of reality, noticing the splendor of dailiness  the way FAA honcho Ben Sliney (who plays himself) receives a standard air traffic briefing, the way flight attendant Sandra Bradshaw (played by Trish Gates, who worked for United herself) changes into heels after takeoff. (Even those professional actors recognizable from their screen and New York stage work  among them Christian Clemenson, Denny Dillon, John Rothman, and Chip Zien  manage to vanish into the real people they play.) And when we see that second plane smash into the Twin Towers  as those in the control tower at Newark did, and everyone watching TV did too  the sight is as dreadful and sickening as if we were seeing it for the first time. But then Greengrass gets back to the still-living, hanging in the air. Decisions need to be made at the various flight centers, with little confirmed information to go on. At the Northeast Air Defense Sector in upstate New York, commanders trained to take action scramble to establish a chain of command that will let them plan a response. On that last doomed plane, passengers begin to make those phone calls home that have come to stand as testaments. The final struggle takes only a few minutes, but it feels like an eternity, a blur of action, the deadly outcome of which cannot be changed by wishing it otherwise.
Do we need to see this? No. There's no right or wrong way to remember 9/11, no shame in skipping the movie-fied sight or prize for those who dare to look. Do we benefit from recognizing, in United 93 , that there's no difference between those who died and us, in fear and in courage? Absolutely.


Taut, visceral and predictably gut-wrenching, "United 93," Paul Greengrass' already much-debated look at Sept. 11, trades in some emotional impact for authenticity, capturing the overwhelming sense of chaos surrounding that day's harrowing events. The result is a tense, documentary-style drama that methodically builds a sense of dread despite the preordained outcome. While media attention has focused on reaction to the movie's trailer, strong ratings for earlier Flight 93 TV projects suggest there will be considerable curiosity, morbid or otherwise, about "United 93" that should translate into robust box office.
Indeed, a certain myopia seems to have overtaken those wringing hands over the "Is it too soon?" question. A&E's "Flight 93," a restrained and impressive achievement on a made-for-TV movie budget, and Discovery Channel's docudrama "The Flight That Fought Back" were major successes for those cable networks.
Inevitably, seeing the same events on a theatrical canvas provides an additional wallop, though writer-director Greengrass' approach -- from the jittery camera to the dozen or so aviation and military personnel who play themselves -- feels more determined to create a "You are there" sensation than to send the audience sobbing into the night. By contrast, a key element of both "Flight 93" and "The Flight That Fought Back," which employed chilling snippets of real audio, depicted friends and relatives of the doomed passengers on the ground, a nuance this telling fastidiously avoids.
Unfolding in real time once the plane is airborne for its 91-minute flight, "United 93" opens with the terrorists rising for morning prayer and blase passengers and crew engaging in mundane chit-chat that suggests just another ordinary day.
Oscillating between the plane's occupants, military personnel at the Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS) and air traffic controllers in New York and Boston, Greengrass (whose credits include "Bloody Sunday") uses a hyper-natural style, chronicling the gradual dawning that the country was facing an unprecedented attack.
The controllers, in fact, at first can barely grasp that a hijacking is in progress, musing it must have been 20 years since the last one. In perhaps the starkest moment, they sit in stunned silence, mouths agape, when the second commandeered jet crashes into the World Trade Center, while an officer at NEADS bellows about being unable to defend the entire eastern seaboard with only four fighter planes.
To pound home the accuracy Greengrass sought, those participating as themselves include Ben Sliney, the Federal Aviation Administration's national operations manager, an adviser on the film who, remarkably, started in that job on Sept. 11; and NEADS Maj. James Fox.
It's roughly an hour into the film before the hijackers brutally leap into action, slaying the pilots and a random passenger. Initially terrified, the other passengers confer with loved ones on the ground via cell and air phones, with Thomas E. Burnett (Christian Clemenson) the first to recognize that their flight is another suicide mission and they must band together to retake the plane.
From the beginning, there has been something tragic and uplifting about Flight 93, the one plane that failed to strike its intended target thanks to the passengers' heroic stand. In that sense, the story became a symbol easily elevated to near-mythical status through facile catchphrases ("Let's roll") and newsmagazines eager to interview surviving relatives.
Greengrass, however, intently delivers a raw, unadorned view, letting the story's inherent drama speak for itself. That much of the cast is unidentifiable only adds to the reality he is determined to unflinchingly convey.
Even with its copious research, the film departs from prior accounts in several subtle and not-so-subtle ways, reminding us (as does a closing disclaimer) that this re-creation is just that -- based on the best available evidence, with inferences and composites constructed for dramatic effect.
Those qualifications aside, "United 93" is technically razor-sharp, from the editing and sound to John Powell's urgent but not intrusive score. Nor is the film's violence any more or less graphic than it needs to be, though something is lost in the one-sided exchanges with loved ones, as passengers come to grips with their likely fate and bid them farewell.
As for that aforementioned closing scroll, "United 93" carries a dedication to those slain on Sept. 11 and a note that the movie was in no way sponsored by United Airlines. Consider it a tribute to the film that each of those postscripts couldn't possibly feel more redundant.

In the city where it will premiere next Tuesday, United 93  is being greetedor repelled?almost as if it were itself some kind of terror attack. Is the movie pornography? Exploitation? Too much too soon?
Having seen it once (apparently with what the studio calls "unfinished" effects), I can attest that the film nobody wants to see is  worth seeing. At the very least, United 93 as the most literal representation yet of that unimaginable morningwill hopefully ignite a meaningful debate about the ethics and politics of 9-11 commemoration.
Paul Greengrass 's approximately real-time dramatization of what took place aboard Flight 93which left Newark  for San Francisco the morning of September 11, 2001, and crashed in western Pennsylvania  81 minutes after takeoffis best understood as a memorial. (It was famously made with the support of the passengers' families, the press kit includes bios not of the actors but of the people they portray, and Universal is donating 10 percent of the first weekend gross to the Flight 93 memorial fund.) Like most memorials, it is respectful, premised on competing obligations to the dead and the living, and eager to stress that the deaths were not in vain. It not only tells us we should never forget but also illustrates how we should remember.
As written and directed by Greengrass, the exBBC  documentarian who already has one skillful re-creation of a historical atrocity under his belt (Bloody Sunday , about 1972's Derry massacre), United 93  is at once scrupulous and ghoulish, visceral and sober. Except for a few crucial deviations from the 9/11 Commission Report  and the black-box tapes played at the Moussaoui  trial, most of the narrative's conjectures are circumspect. There is not a conspiracy theory in sight.
United 93  may be unrelenting, but for almost its entire duration, it depends on a grim foreknowledge that is the opposite of suspense. Greengrass, as he demonstrated in Bloody Sunday , has a talent for hectic naturalism and panoramic contextthe cross talk and propulsive intercutting add up to a lucid big picture. Title notwithstanding, United 93  does not confine itself to the doomed airliner. Fully half of the film transpires in various control centers (in Boston, New York, Cleveland, etc.), as well as at the FAA 's command center in Herndon, Virginia, and the Northeast Air Defense Sector base in Rome, New York. Some of the tensest moments involve bewildered air traffic officers staring at green screens, struggling to decipher ominous radio transmissions and vanishing radar blips. (Ben Sliney , who was on his first day as the FAA's operations manager, plays himself.)
United 93 's general discretion and lack of inflection is an acknowledgment of the day's outsize drama. Even the uprising's presidentially coopted battle cry is de-emphasized, folded into a sotto voce murmur: Let's roll come on let's go already . (As has now been widely reported, the phrase captured on the cockpit voice recorder is "Roll it.") But the low-key tone is also meant to signal a moral seriousness. A&E's recent TV movie Flight 93 , weepily eavesdropping on one Final Call after another, indulged in morbid voyeurism. Greengrass, who may yet emerge as the Maya Lin  of cine-memorialists, knows that restraint is both tasteful and authoritative.
And United 93 's claim to authority is precisely its biggest problem. Greengrass has been grandiose in his public statements: The film aims to arrive at "a believable truth" and may even reveal "the DNA of our times." Its quasi-vérité suggests an implicit fidelity, when what's in operation is at best imaginative empathy and at worst arrogance, an obviously untenable assertion that this  is how it happened.
The temptation to fix on a definitive narrative of Flight 93 is obvious. The most dramatic 9-11 subplot to have wholly escaped the reach of news cameras, this unseen event exerted an immediate stranglehold on the national imagination. As was quickly apparent, not least to the president's speechwriters, Flight 93 was an eminently marketable legend. The initial mythwhich persisted until investigators discounted it nearly two years laterheld that the passengers had improvised a kamikaze response to their hijackers' suicide mission; the "citizen soldiers," as Tom Ridge  eulogized them, crashed the plane in a bid to defend the Capitol or the White House .
Greengrass's account splits the difference between this rah-rah version and the more tempered findings of the 9-11 Commission. His point is broadly similar to that of literary critic and plane crash expert Elaine Scarry , who in the 2002 Boston Review  article "Citizenship in Emergency" juxtaposed the successful revolt aboard Flight 93which, whether or not the passengers breached the cockpit, almost certainly contributed to its crashwith the Pentagon 's failure to defend itself and the nation.
United 93 , in providing a coherent and vividly edited macro timeline of the day's hijackings and crashes, is a uniquely damning description of the chain-of-command failures and communication breakdowns that characterized the official response to the terrorist attacks. The film suggests that if the FAA, the military, and the airlines had been talking to each other that morning, Flight 93 need never have left the Newark tarmac. When it took off at 8:42, at least one hijacking was already well under way (American Flight 11 hit the north tower at 8:46). Twenty minutes earlier, the Boston control center had received the first suspicious transmission from the first hijacked aircraft: "We have some planes." (United 93  dispels the most popular conspiracy theory by pointing to incompetencethe plane wasn't shot down because the government was too stunned and unprepared to have done any such thing.)
