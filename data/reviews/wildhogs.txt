With his doughy face and oversized features, Travolta seems like a giant puppet these days. The lanky stud from Urban Cowboy
 and even the cool killer from Pulp Fiction
 are hazy memories amid his over-the-top performance from the school of freak-out acting. Sadly, in this mediocre comedy, Travolta stands out as not only the most mediocre but the most annoying as well. The story of middle-aged suburban professionals seeking life�s purpose on a cross-country motorcycle trip is your basic formulaic Hollywood comedy. Four friends, Doug (Allen), Woody (Travolta), Bobby (Lawrence), and Dudley (Macy) make up the Wild Hogs, a group of bored suburbanites who engage in a weekly motorcycling ritual that involves leathering up, riding around, and drinking beers. When Woody�s enviable life (which includes a swimsuit-model wife and successful career) falls apart, he encourages the guys to mount their hogs and ride to the coast. As the wannabes set out in search of true freedom, the expected troubles arise in the form of tents burning to the ground and a run-in with an actual biker gang known as the Del Fuegos. The leader of said bikers, Jack (Liotta), quickly develops a vendetta against the foursome when Woody �accidentally� blows up their bar. As a result, every greasy meathead from central casting is enlisted in a desperate chase to track down and destroy the Wild Hogs. When the Hogs hide out in a roadside town that is frequently attacked by the roaming Del Fuegos, they�re forced to face their fears and protect the town as the film becomes yet another retelling of the Kurosawa classic Seven Samurai
. But despite this lineage, Wild Hogs
 remains firmly rooted in the lowbrow. The writer (Brad Copeland, seasoned from TV�s Arrested Development
 and My Name Is Earl
) combines some good comedy, usually involving Lawrence, with weak comedy, usually involving poop (both bird and human). And a note to screenwriters everywhere regarding characters over 50 whose inability to use the Internet results in being trapped on a porn site (see Wild Hogs
 and Because I Said So
 among others): It�s not funny; please stop doing it. The only really laugh-out-loud moment occurs when Kyle Gass (one half of Tenacious D) dances around on a plywood stage in a glittery shirt, belting out, �Don�t cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me?� It�s comedy gold amidst a lot of coal.


The question that needs to be asked about "Wild Hogs," the shamelessly broad middle-age-crazy biker comedy opening today, is this: Can William H. Macy pull Tim Allen up to "Fargo" level, or will Tim Allen drag William H. Macy down into "Christmas With the Kranks" perdition?
It's a draw, actually, with John Travolta and Martin Lawrence refereeing. The unlikely quartet -- more a pick-up golf game than a cast -- play four friends on a cross-country motorcycle road trip, and a sorrier, saggier lot you won't find. The movie is this year's "RV," a rolling tent show of suburban male anxieties: castration, obsolescence, dismissive offspring, fears of gayness. Lots 
of fears of gayness. Unlike "RV," though, "Wild Hogs" is funny. Eventually.
Allen is Doug, a onetime free-riding stoner now trapped in the body of a middle-aged Cincinnati dentist, with obnoxious son (Dominic James) and understanding spouse (Jill Hennessy). Lawrence is Bobby, a plumber and wannabe novelist with a two-dimensional harpy of a wife (Tichina Arnold).
Macy is Dudley, a gentle, addled computer geek who doesn't know how swish he acts (the actor plays this strange notion straight, as he must). Travolta is Woody, a high-powered lawyer whose life has fallen apart and who persuades the others -- weekend rebels like himself -- to chuck it all and drive to the West Coast.
And so their tent catches fire and the boys have to share a sleeping bag and get woken up by a glowering motorcycle cop (John C. McGinley , strappingly amusing) who's a butch closet case himself, wouldn't you know. Or they go skinny-dipping and are interrupted by a wholesome family terrified by the idea of four grown men naked. At times "Wild Hogs" seems less of a comedy and more like bizarre confessional therapy for writer and sitcom veteran Brad Copeland and director Walt Becker ("Van Wilder"). Or maybe this is what a few decades of gay pride has wrought: nervous-nellie straight-guy slapstick that protesteth far too much.
The movie's on safer ground with standard gags like bugs splatting on helmets, and it takes a satisfying turn when the Hogs roll into a New Mexico biker bar lorded over by Ray Liotta, who combines his "Something Wild" psycho act with that scary giggle from "Goodfellas." His gang, the Del Fuegos, are the "real deal," to quote Bobby, and after a few mishaps the Wild Hogs are fleeing this mob's assembled fury. Where's Pee-wee Herman to dance to "Tequila" when you need him?
The four take refuge in a desert town, the kind of place where Marisa Tomei is a diner owner named Maggie and the veteran character nerd Stephen Tobolowsky plays the sheriff. At this point "Wild Hogs" turns into "The Wild One" meets "High Noon" on the set of "Northern Exposure," and truth be told, the results are pretty engaging for a stu-com. A cameo appearance by a biker-movie icon who's been popping up a lot lately seals the deal.
The stars have settled into their roles by now, and each earns his designated chuckle (except for Allen, who's just not blandly smug for once). Dudley turns out to be straight, so we can all sleep soundly on that one. More to the point, the jokes somehow get an extra quarter-turn, and with the increased comic torque, the movie fires better.
"Wild Hogs" wants to be as dumb as they come, but there are smart people involved no matter how hard they try to hide it. The film's a bumptious weekend ride: The engine could use tuning and the plugs are shot, but it gets you most of the way there.


         The open road ain't what it used to be. From Horace Greeley to "Little Miss Sunshine," Americans have been finding themselves on the journey west, seeking uncharted territory they can call their own. But the landscape of "Wild Hogs" is cluttered with the comic equivalent of suburban sprawl, an endless cyclorama of rehashed jokes and whiny complaint.
 
  A reformed party animal with a neurotic wife and a disdainful teen son, Doug (Tim Allen) is smothering in his suburban straitjacket. Ditto his high school buddies: Bobby (Martin Lawrence), a henpecked househusband whose wife treats him like a disobedient pup, and Dudley (William H. Macy), a high-strung computer geek whose attempts to interface with the opposite sex inevitably end in a catastrophic crash. Woody (John Travolta) would seem to have struck it rich, but it seems his supermodel wife is in the process of divorcing him, taking what's left of his money with her.
 


         






    For years, these weekend warriors have burnished their masculinity with periodic spins on their barely used motorcycles, but their synchronized midlife crises dictate a more radical change of scenery: a real-life road trip from Cincinnati to the coast, complete with fatty foods and more male bonding than you can shake an Allen wrench at.
 
  Lest the spectacle of four leather-clad men sleeping under the stars start to seem a little, well, Freudian, "Wild Hogs" provides a constant stream of opportunities for these uneasy riders to demonstrate their heterosexuality. The innuendoes of a buff motorcycle cop (John C. McGinley) provoke a fit of panicked crotch-clutching, and when they're confronted by a gang of real-life bikers, Bobby says with a shudder, "Does anyone else get that pre-rape feeling?"
 
  The filmmakers needn't have worried, since evidence of intimacy among the men is in short supply. Apart from Macy, who cannily underplays his gawky nebbish, the movie's leads are palpably incapable of sharing scenes with each other. They act as if they're in different movies, and given the movie's tendency to strand them in isolating close-ups, they might as well be. There's no sense that these men have known each other for days, let alone decades.
 
  Desperately needing an antagonist to provide them with a sense of purpose, the fumbling foursome run afoul of the Del Fuegos, a band of outlaw bikers headed by Ray Liotta's tattooed snarler. Soon enough, there's a small town to defend from the Del Fuegos' bad intentions, complete with a comely diner owner (Marisa Tomei) who takes a shine to Dudley and a well-meaning but inept sheriff (Stephen Tobolowsky) who desperately needs the help of a few good men. Or, in a pinch, a few paunchy, punchy suburbanites with nothing to lose but their last shreds of dignity.
 
  By the time it sputters across the finish line, "Wild Hogs" feels as if it's gone on forever — like a trip in a hot car with the windows rolled up. The air is stale and hard to breathe, and it sure feels good when it's over.
 
  "Wild Hogs." MPAA rating: PG-13 for crude and sexual content, and some violence. Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes. In general release.   

One Harley-driving suburban weekend warrior in Wild Hogs  submits meekly to a bossy wife who treats him like a dog, literally, snapping at him to ''Stay!'' and ''Come!'' Another highflier gets dumped by his swimsuit model of a girlfriend because of his recent brokeness. One's married to a nice lady who treats her husband like a second child because he acts like one. And the fourth, a single computer programmer, is just scared silly by girls  why else would he turn them off so reliably by securing his eyeglasses with a head strap?
Women, hmmmph! They can make a bunch of guys want to blast out of Cincinnati and hit the road like fans of Easy Rider , ditching their easy-waistband pants in favor of black leather. Tim Allen (the childish one), John Travolta (the dumped one), Martin Lawrence (the whipped one), and William H. Macy (the nerdy one) aren't a natural fit together  each demonstrates moments of thespian discomfort, masked as actorly  camaraderie. (Ha-ha, the guys go commando in a swimming hole!) But then, nothing about this sputtering midlife-crisis family comedy is natural except the timeless notion that even the most latte-tamed baby boomer has the power to reclaim his inner Iron John. Ray Liotta provides the one true blast of comedic energy as the leader of a real, more pugnacious head-butting gang who tangles with the four amigos. Think the Hogs can take him down? Hear them squeal, then roar.

 “The Four Little Piggies” — “Wild Hogs,” the real title, doesn’t work as well — is a comedy about male midlife anxiety. Some of us may not find the subject so funny, but never mind. Somebody needed to revive the “City Slickers” formula, and this time  the job has gone to Brad Copeland, who wrote the screenplay, and Walt Becker, who directed.  Four buddies, fed up with the frustration and disappointment of their lives, set out on a road trip aboard their beloved motorcycles. Doug (Tim Allen), a dentist, worries that he has become so dull and uncool that he has lost the respect of his preadolescent son. Woody (John Travolta) is a hotshot deal maker who has lost his wife and his money. Bobby (Martin Lawrence), a plumber turned writer, is hopelessly henpecked, while Dudley (William H. Macy) is a hopeless nerd. (He is also at least the second character in a comedy released this year, after Diane Keaton’s in “Because I Said So,” whose computer gets stuck on a noisy Internet porn site, a situation he is unable to remedy. This kind of thing must happen a lot to Hollywood screenwriters.)  The main thing about these guys — the main source of the movie’s fumbling attempts at humor — is that they’re not gay. Really. Seriously. No way. They may worry about people thinking that they’re gay, and they may do things that might make people think that they’re gay — dance, touch one another, take off their clothes, express emotion — but they’re absolutely 100 percent not gay. No no no no no no. No sir, I mean, no ma’am. That’s what makes it funny, see.  After camping out one night, for example, they have a conversation that’s overheard by a highway patrolman (John C. McGinley) who decides, based on his misunderstanding of the perfectly innocent things they’re saying, that they must be gay. But the thing is — get this — he’s the one who’s gay! You think he’s a stereotypical homophobe, but he turns out to be a homophobic stereotype. It’s magic!  Anyway, the four nongay guys run afoul of some real bikers — one of whom might be gay! — and have to prove their manhood by standing up to the bullies. In the process, one of them gets it on with Marisa Tomei in the most nongay way imaginable within the limits of a PG-13 movie. The wives of the two who still have wives show up, proving, well, you know. And the fourth one? Could it be? Shut up!  Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Allen, who have never aspired very far beyond their affable television-comedy personas, are easier to watch than Mr. Travolta or Mr. Macy, who both  undertake what can only be called acting. This is more than the picture deserves, but then again, so is Ray Liotta, as the chieftain of the bad bikers, and so is Ms. Tomei.  “Wild Hogs” does deserve credit for a small but significant measure of originality. Its soundtrack is full of classic, open-road rock ’n’ roll songs — “Highway to Hell,” for example — not one of which is “Born to Be Wild.”  “Wild Hogs” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has swearing, fighting and sexual innuendo. But don’t get the wrong idea. 

Male menopause spews a lot of exhaust in "Wild Hogs," a high-concept middlebrow comedy with Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy as staid suburbanites who decide to discover America a la "Easy Rider." Peter Fonda actually turns up in the closing reel, yet one suspects fictive Captain America is spinning somewhere in his off-highway grave. Uninspired script and broad slapstick yuks won't earn this any plaudits, but slick, safe package should do OK with North American mall auds. Offshore appeal is likely to be weaker, though ancillary action in most territories will be solid.
Stars portray upper-middle-class weekend warriors who straddle rumbling steel and cruise Cincinnati streets (with the "Wild Hogs" moniker sewn onto their leather jackets by one indulgent wife) in a weekly display of ersatz outlawdom.
But they're more Mild Ones than Wild Ones. Bobby (Lawrence) is a henpecked plumber working on a self-help book, Doug (Allen) a dentist dissed as lame by his own pubescent son, and computer programmer Dudley (Macy) is a cloddish bachelor too shy to approach women. High-flying investor Woody (Travolta) appears to have it all, but his swimsuit-model trophy wife has left him, and he's just been informed he's bankrupt.
Eager to escape those problems (without disclosing them), Woody tells his buds they've lost collective edge and need a road trip to reclaim it. After minor finagling, they take off with no plan in mind beyond reaching the Pacific. It doesn't take them long to blunder into a "real biker bar," where they run afoul of a gang called Del Fuegos, headed by Jack (Ray Liotta) and musclehead second-in-command Red (Kevin Durand, aka standup comic Tree).
Woody semi-accidentally ensures their exit will enrage Del Fuegos to a boilover degree. This affront pinions the Wild Hogs once they've run out of gas in a remote desert hamlet, where Dudley falls for Marisa Tomei's diner proprietress.
Inevitable showdown finds the little guys that could standing up to the bad guys, while grateful all-American townsfolk cheer on. Fonda plays a key part in Del Fuegos' unlikely, shamed slink-away after they've proved themselves bullies and louts. (Incredibly, the screenplay originally identified the meanies as Hell's Angels, until the real ones sued Disney. Who'd have thought they'd object to being portrayed as stock Neanderthal bullies?)
In place of the usual not-so-funny bloopers, the final credits scroll instead offers unfunny mock scenes from "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition," complete with host Ty Pennington. 
Pic reps the third feature from Walt Becker, who helmed the 2002 sleeper hit "Van Wilder" and "Buying the Cow" (which he co-wrote), a lively romantic comedy that went straight to home screens and was marred by homophobic humor.
Though Becker didn't write "Hogs," its early progress is similarly angled, with much "ewww!" mileage eked from the ways in which Macy's sensitive-guy nature sometimes make him seem "gay," plus a randy cop ("Scrubs' " John C. McGinley) who misreads the traveling male quartet's bond. Studio product once ridiculed homosexuals outright -- now it goes the more insidious route of milking the straight characters' "hilarious" revulsion whenever they come in contact with or are mistaken for gay people.
Given his writer-producer credits on good-to-great recent sitcoms ("My Name Is Earl," "Arrested Development," "Grounded for Life"), one might expect more situational wit, or at least some snappy patter, from Brad Copeland's first bigscreen script. Instead, the humor rests primarily on slapstick wipeouts that have no physical consequence, as well as de rigeur crotch kicks and pee-pee/ca-ca stuff.
No players are seen to their best advantage (Liotta and Tomei seem especially nonplussed), though Travolta has amusing moments of bogus bravado.
Presentation is polished and pacey enough, with America (the U.S., that is) looking duly worth discovering for the scenic splendors backdropped in Robbie Greenberg's widescreen lensing. Soundtrack makes predictable use of retro party anthems by Grand Funk Railroad, Foghat, AC/DC and others. 


This shallow comedy  imagines itself as an amalgam of St. Elmo's Fire , The Wild Bunch,  and Deliverance or so says smarmy Woody (John Travolta ), who convinces his pals (played by Tim Allen , William H. Macy , and Martin Lawrence ) to ditch their day jobs for a week on the road, traveling from Ohio to California on Harleys and in strip-mall-purchased leather pants. Wild Hogs , directed by the guy who made Van Wilder , also fancies itself a sorta-sequel to Easy Rider; hence the last-scene cameo from one of that movie's stars, who shows up to apologize for the bad behavior of a biker gang that's lost sight of what it means to "be free." In that respect, Wild Hogs  would have you believe it's also  a successor to Albert Brooks 's Lost in America, in which an ad man ditches his comfortable existence to drop out and discover the countryside. But Brooks's film was shot through with honest desperationat least he knew  he was being an ass.
