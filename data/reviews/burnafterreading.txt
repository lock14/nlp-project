Burn After Reading
, the new film from the Coen brothers, won�t be mistaken for Fargo
 anytime soon. Or Barton Fink
 or The Man Who Wasn�t There
. Those films were black comedy done to perfection: They coerced viewers into laughing out loud at murder and moral decay and the vast emptiness of an uncaring universe and thereby made them complicit in all the nastiness unfolding onscreen. Burn After Reading
 is something different and something less � something new, possibly, and definitely something only the Coens would attempt in this day and age: screwball
 black comedy. Not since Arsenic and Old Lace
 has there been a movie that brushes so flippantly over the worst kind of human behavior and disposes of its characters with such antic indifference. Rant or rave about Quentin Tarantino all you want: He�s got nothing on the Coen brothers when it comes to the casual snuffing-out of human life. Burn After Reading
 is a convoluted yet light-as-air farce about the dangers of misguided ambition and the contagiousness of paranoia. Osborne Cox (Malkovich) is a lifelong CIA analyst who is fired from his position at the Balkan desk when his love of alcohol becomes too much for the agency to abide. �You�re a Mormon!� he reminds one of his accusers. �Compared to you, everyone has a drinking problem.� Newly unemployed and indignant, Cox decides to write a memoir about his time with the agency but ends up instead on the wrong end of a blackmail scheme after his wife, Katie (Swinton), misplaces copies of his computer files she burned in anticipation of her divorce suit. Those files end up in the hands of a bumbling duo, Linda Litzke (McDormand) and Chad Feldheimer (Pitt), two likable, middle-aged losers who think they�ve stumbled upon classified government documents and figure they�ll make a little money selling them to the highest bidder, be he Cox, the cultural attach� at the Russian Embassy, or any other shady figure who might be interested. Litzke and Feldheimer are a classic ditzy comedy pair, and their pathological dopiness allows the Coens to mock the conventions of spy movies in a way only they can (�Is this a secure line?� Litzke asks one potential co-conspirator over the phone, sounding as if she just got through watching an I Spy
 marathon). But they�re also the movie�s Achilles' heel: heroes whose bulging-eyed broadness descends quickly into burlesque, meaning the increasingly depraved and dangerous consequences of their actions affect us less and less the longer the movie goes on. Say what you will about the cinematic joys of extortion, infidelity, espionage, paranoia, and random acts of graphic violence; if they�re performed by cartoons and not people, it�s going to be hard to get the people sitting in the theatre to care. The Coen brothers may be masters of black comedy, but there are times when there�s no point in taking them seriously.


After a dark spell, Coens swing back to comedy with 'Burn'
Over the years, the Coen brothers have become the movie equivalent of an inconstant lover. They�re almost always charming and witty and creative, and sometimes they come through with a ��Fargo,�� so for a second you think there might actually be a long-term relationship there. But then they�ll stand you up at a restaurant and laugh at you for getting mad, and you realize that whatever matters to you, it sure doesn�t matter to them.
��Burn After Reading�� stands us up at the restaurant � and things were going so well, too. After being richly rewarded for the dark, uncompromising vision that was last year�s ��No Country for Old Men,�� the Coens have returned to what they like best, which is goofing around with their buddies.
The new film, a slapstick farce in which a number of big Hollywood stars play middle-class boneheads, is set in Washington, D.C. This has led some to seek a political interpretation in the pratfalls; I assure you, no such interpretation exists. John Malkovich plays Osborne Cox, a rageaholic ex-CIA functionary who has written his memoirs, hoping they�ll burn Langley down. Instead, the disc containing the manuscript ends up in the possession of two idiot health-club employees, Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt) and Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand).
They decide to shake Osborne down, threatening to take the information to the Russians if he doesn�t play ball. (The vaguely embarrassed expression on a cultural attache at the Russian embassy is one of the movie�s better jokes.) Working at cross-purposes to these three are Osborne�s unhappy wife (Tilda Swinton) and her macho twit of a boyfriend (George Clooney).
The computer disc is a MacGuffin, as is the entire plot, really; the entertainment here lies in watching these dumdums twist in their own wind. ��Burn After Reading�� is a character comedy, which means everyone behaves like a character. McDormand does rabbity things with her teeth, turning Linda into a self-obsessed, oversexed nerd who can�t stop thinking about the plastic surgery she thinks she needs. Clooney, meanwhile, acts with his throat; his character isn�t sure what foods he�s allergic to and keeps teetering phlegmily on the verge of anaphylactic shock.
Malkovich bellows and swears (he�s been given Steve Buscemi�s speech patterns from ��Fargo��), while Swinton plays an ice-cold control freak � nothing new there. Richard Jenkins, as McDormand�s boss, pines for her with sad-clown eyes, or perhaps he�s missing his role from ��The Visitor.�� Pitt � well, actually, Pitt�s hilarious. Chad is the one person here not stomping around in a foul mood only because he�s too stupid to get angry. Each new idea seems like the first idea Chad has ever had; the act of thinking itself fills him with awe.
Pitt�s also the only performer here whose shtick seems to rise from character rather than the other way around. ��Burn After Reading�� is shallow and proud of it, an antic cartoon that lacks the comic inspiration to go the distance. The biggest laughs don�t even come from the main characters but from a pair of deadpan CIA suits (J.K. Simmons and David Rasche) who regularly brief each other on the increasingly preposterous goings-on. They could be the Coens themselves snarking away at their characters. In a way, that�s the real show.
I suppose the filmmakers have earned a break. Heck, after ��No Country,�� we�ve earned a break. But the difference between ��Burn After Reading�� and much better Coen comedies like ��Raising Arizona,�� ��Fargo,�� and ��O Brother, Where Art Thou?�� is that the brothers� smugness has finally gone over the top. Perhaps winning acclaim and Oscars will do that, but never has one of their movies seemed like such an inside joke. ��Burn�� is a party to which the audience isn�t invited, its unheard soundtrack the Coens� nervous hermetic giggles.
Way back when they got started, with 1984�s ��Blood Simple,�� the Coens were able to take a dinky story of greed and ineptness and spin it into an epic. ��Burn�� manages the opposite: Despite the D.C. setting and international-espionage backdrop, the film�s pointless enough to make you suspect the artistic maturity of ��No Country for Old Men�� may have been just another pose. Whatever talents the Coens possess, ��Burn After Reading�� reminds us that ��meaning it�� may never be one of them.


Anyone who has seen the trailer for Burn After Reading  on TV  and given the aggressiveness of the promotional campaign for this lazy new frolic, I assume most everyone has  knows the movie (1) is written and directed by the same guys who made No Country for Old Men  , and (2) shares none of No Country 's qualities in any category except silliness of hairdos on   movie stars happy to look dorky in the service of Joel and Ethan Coen. The dour terrain of novelist Cormac McCarthy sharpened the best of the brothers' instincts for tracking the path of human anarchy, and the reward from their public and peers was a bookcase of awards, Oscars included. But the reward to themselves turns out to be a retreat to the   familiar funny farm. Once more in Burn After Reading  they goof around, in their arch, bemused way, with conventions of genre  a little screwball here, some spy spoof there. Once more they work from an original Coen story in which needy people are rewarded with chuckles for their neediness. Once more fans of Fargo   and  The Big Lebowski   (as well as those random contrarians who liked The Ladykillers   and Intolerable Cruelty  ) know what to expect.
But as a result of all that tilling, the movie is overplowed, even if Brad Pitt 's debut as a Coen comedy player is eye-catching: The star rags on his own pretty-boy status by genially rocking a bleached-skunk coif bound to draw as much comment as Javier Bardem 's No Country  pageboy. Pitt plays Chad Feldheimer (the characters wear funny-sounding names as they might fake mustaches), a gym trainer low on intellectual wattage but high on electrolytes in a suburban Washington, D.C., fitness club. Chad happens to find a lost computer disc on the gym floor that may contain valuable information.
And then stuff happens, a giddily self-destructing spiral of missteps   involving Osborne Cox (John Malkovich ), a drink-prone CIA spook fired from his job, who seeks revenge by writing a memoir (the disc contains his notes); the spy's disdainful wife, Katie Cox (the great Tilda Swinton , who can do sexy chill as either comedy or tragedy on demand); and Katie's womanizing lover, Harry Pfarrer (George Clooney ), a federal marshal whose equanimity rises and falls depending on whether he gets in his regular five-mile run, ideally after sex. (Good news: Clooney plays the third in what he has called his Coen-created ''trilogy of idiots'' with less of a capital I  than he did in O Brother, Where Art Thou?   and Intolerable Cruelty .) For idle amusement, Osborne Cox sports a bow tie and a loyalty to his fellow Princeton alumni, signifying a brand of outmoded, old-boy values I guess the filmmakers are laughing at just because such things are outmoded. Even so, the ever more rococo performance artiste Malkovich manages to bust looser and goosier than even the Coens know what to do with, and his virtuoso thespian arias of alcohol- enhanced nuttiness (precisely tailored to fit an aging ex–CIA man's lifestyle) are the   movie's one honestly fresh turn of the screwy.
All of which brings us back to the boob played by Pitt, as well as to Frances McDormand , that marvel of fine acting chops and confounding taste in the roles she takes, both in and out of Coen productions (she hasn't been married to Joel Coen all these years for nothing). Here, McDormand portrays fellow gym employee Linda Litzke, a sad, single lady who treats her femininity as something akin to an embarrassing, itchy rash. (She's got some of the choppy, desexualized speech patterns of Fargo 's Marge Gunderson, and a whole lot more self-loathing.) Linda hates everything about her face and body  her goal is to   finance a head-to-toe surgical overhaul, possibly with extortion money wrung from Chad for his computer disc, if that's what it takes. Still, she's also brave enough to look for love online; she dares to have real feelings. And while she hurts, we're invited to laugh. Linda is Burn After Reading 's most troublesome character  she's a serious woman disguised as a joke, thrown into a story that has no use for seriousness (or, jeez, for women). Here's something to consider after watching Pitt revel in the role of a dim bulb perfectly contented with his life while McDormand  is stuck once again playing a bright-enough woman discontented with the universe:   Is this not very old country for Coen men?

 Heart isn’t usually part of the discussion when we talk about movies, partly, I imagine, because it sounds too corny. And fuzzy. After all, what does it mean to say this or that director or film shows a lot of heart or too little? I ask only because “Burn After Reading,” the clubby, predictably self-amused comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen, has a tricky plot, visual style, er, to burn, but so little heart as to warrant a Jarvik 8.  Not that you probably won’t choke up a couple of ho-ho’s in between a few hee-hee’s whenever Big Daddy Brad Pitt, as a nitwit gym rat with a Pepe Le Pew two-tone hair-stack, twitches across the screen or the camera nuzzles one of the other goofy gargoyles so beloved by the Coens. Mr. Pitt’s Chad is the overripe second banana to Linda Litzke (Frances McDormand, Joel Coen’s wife), who has some vague job at the gym where the two sort of work. Chad’s a buffoon (the hard body as soft brain), and Mr. Pitt has been charged with delivering a caricature rather than a character, but because the actor loves playing sidemen and conveys such natural, irrepressible (irresistible) sweetness, he’s also one of the film’s saving graces.  It could use a few more. Like most of the Coens’ comedies, “Burn After Reading” is something of a shaggy sendup of an established genre and conventions, in this case the espionage flick. The film opens and closes with a Google Maps view of the Earth that has already become a cinematic cliché, a godly perspective that rapidly narrows in on the headquarters for the Central Intelligence Agency in Langley, Va. There, an analyst named Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) soon receives a demotion for boozing, the first knot in an increasingly and intentionally tangled thicket of contrivances and coincidences mostly involving three favorite American (and Hollywood) preoccupations: money, sex and self.  With its complexly interwoven stories, political backdrop and the central presence of a bearded George Clooney, the film comes across a bit like “Syriana for Dummies,” though given the original this seems somewhat redundant. Here Mr. Clooney, recycling the tic-y head bobs and weaves from his “ER” days, plays Harry Pfarrer, a federal marshal who is two-timing his wife, Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel), with Osborne’s scarier better half, Katie (Tilda Swinton). A serial adulterer who totes his own wedge-shaped bolster to his assignations, Harry hooks up with Linda through the Internet, an improbability only slightly less preposterous than the computer disk of C.I.A. secrets that ends up floating around Linda and Chad’s gym and leading them in a world of trouble. As Donald H. Rumsfeld once said, “Stuff happens.”  Professional wisenheimers, the Coens like squeezing laughs out of potentially hazardous material, whether they’re dumping a paraplegic out of a wheelchair for a chuckle, as they do in their finest film, “The Big Lebowski” (a comedy about the drama of friendship), or violently disposing of bit players, as they do in their most recent , “No Country for Old Men” (a drama about the comedy of death). They have a gift for the absurd and a penchant for cruelty, tendencies that, without the tempering quality of a recognizably human presence — Jeff Bridges’s glorious performance in “Lebowski,” Ms. McDormand’s emotionally nuanced one in “Fargo” — can make the Coens come across as insufferably superior and bullying. Comedy needs fools with funny faces, but comedy without gentleness is often just sadism.  It isn’t that sadism can’t be a laugh riot; it’s just a question of modulation, of balancing the loud yuks and cruel jabs with some delicate feeling, mixing a real face in with the cartoons. Though “Burn After Reading” isn’t as uniformly flat as “The Hudsucker Proxy” (the Coens’ leaden bid for Preston Sturges’s dizziness), there’s a crushing sameness to the characters and their predicaments. With the exceptions of the hard-working supporting cast — notably J. K. Simmons as a C.I.A. bigwig and the equally reliable and welcome Richard Jenkins as a lovelorn gym manager — the characters have been conceived as variations on self-deluded boobishness. Some (like Katie) appear sharper than others, others dumber (Linda), but they’re all punch lines in an overly extended joke.  The biggest punch line is Linda, whom Ms. McDormand plays with a grin that tends to look more like a grimace, perhaps because she’s been saddled with yet another one of the Coens’ ghastly pageboy dos. (Really? Again?) It’s a punishing look for a cruelly unflattering character whose narcissism is matched only by her witlessness. Jerry Lewis has made a brilliant career out of playing stupid, but you never feel as if he loathes his disorderly orderlies because they’re slow on the uptake. The Coens in turn have made their careers with impeccable technique and an exaggerated visual style — they sure love their low-angle shots and traveling cameras — but it’s a wonder they keep making films about a subject for which they often evince so little regard, namely other people.    “Burn After Reading” is rated R (No one under 17 admitted without parent or accompanying adult). Some bloody violence and many  expletives.

After their triumphant dramatic success with �No Country for Old Men,� the Coen brothers revert to sophomoric snarky mode in �Burn After Reading.� A dark goofball comedy about assorted doofuses in Washington, D.C., only some of whom work for the government, the short, snappy picture tries to mate sex farce with a satire of a paranoid political thriller, with arch and ungainly results. Major star names might stoke some mild B.O. heat with older upscale viewers upon U.S. release Sept. 12, but no one should expect this reunion of George Clooney and Brad Pitt to remotely resemble an �Ocean�s� film commercially. 
A seriously talented cast has been asked to act like cartoon characters in this tale of desperation, mutual suspicion and vigorous musical beds, all in the name of laughs that only sporadically ensue. Everything here, from the thesps� heavy mugging to the uncustomarily overbearing score by Carter Burwell and the artificially augmented vulgarities in the dialogue, has been dialed up to an almost grotesquely exaggerated extent, making for a film that feels misjudged from the opening scene and thereafter only occasionally hits the right note.
Ironically, said curtain-raiser shows the CIA actually getting something right. Career analyst Osborne Cox (John Malkovich) is shoved out, and his subsequent obscene tantrum demonstrates he has all the decorum and self-control of a 5-year-old. Lying to his wife, Katie (Tilda Swinton), that he quit, Osborne sets about writing an explosive memoir, while no-nonsense Katie now seriously begins considering leaving her unhinged husband for her happy-go-lucky lover Harry (Clooney), a federal marshal none too committed to wife Sandy (Elizabeth Marvel).
In an utterly unrelated orbit of D.C. life, desperately middle-aged Linda (Frances McDormand) is pissed that the insurance company for the fitness center where she works won�t cover the extensive plastic surgery she urgently wants done. So antic and frantic you wonder if anesthesia would ever work on her, she suddenly steps into merde with gym trainer Chad (Pitt), who�s even more hyperactive than she is, when the latter finds a disc they think is loaded with ultra-classified information.
With frosted blond hair, and appearing so dense he may as well have his low-double-digit IQ pasted to his forehead, Pitt�s Chad is what passes for a riot here. Film�s funniest scene may be that in which Chad, having traced the disc to Osborne, phones the latter in the middle of the night to initiate the blackmail scheme that will net Linda the coin she needs to transform her bod. Pitt slices the ham very thick indeed, but uniquely emerges as endearing in doing so.
Coincidentally, Internet dater Linda starts shagging Harry, who, amusingly, likes to go for long runs after sex, and just past the one-hour mark, one major character gets blown away in an accident, a development that�s supposed to be funny as well as startling.
The Coens� script, which feels immature but was evidently written around the same time as that for �No Country,� is just too fundamentally silly, without the grounding of a serious substructure that would make the sudden turn to violence catch the viewer up short. Nothing about the project�s execution inspires the feeling that this was ever intended as anything more than a lark, which would be fine if it were a good one. As it is, audience teeth-grinding sets in early and never lets up.
Incidental niceties crop up, to be sure. The Coens� economy of storytelling is in evidence, as is their unerring visual sense, this time in league with cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki; a low-angle shot of Harry, knife in hand, lingers especially. The date montages are cute, and the facial reactions of JK Simmons, playing a CIA boss more dedicated to avoiding fuss and bother than to getting to the bottom of things, are once again priceless. But on any more substantive level, �Burn After Reading� is a flame-out. 


Masters of the carefully crafted cheap shot, Joel and Ethan Coen  have built a career on flippancy. Given their refusal to take anything seriously—least of all the enthusiasm of their fans—the brothers surely got a chuckle from an upcoming academic tome, The Philosophy of the Coen Brothers : "Once again, Kierkegaard's distinction between the aesthetic and ethical points of view is instructive in understanding [O Brother, Where Art Thou? 's] apparently unresolved comic conclusion," writes one contributor.
Either/Or  notwithstanding, I'd say that, at least in Coenville (where the motto is "What Fools These Hegelians Be"), the aesthetic regularly and resoundingly trumps the ethical. Following their multiple- Oscar-winning, critically acclaimed literary adaptation No Country for Old Men , the Coens return to familiar territory with the parody thriller Burn After Reading , a characteristically supercilious and crisply shot clown show filled with cartoon perfs and predicated on extravagant stupidity.
Taking aim at the CIA as well as Washington-paranoia flicks in general, Burn After Reading 's filmmaking is as svelte as its attitude is snarky. For openers, the camera descends (or Coen-descends) from an Olympian altitude, high over America, to the corridors of CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia , and scurries into an office where intelligence reader Osborne Cox  (John Malkovich ) is being taken off the Balkan desk. (Much entertaining banter: "You have a drinking problem," one nerdy suit informs the irate Cox. "Fuck you, Peck—you're a Mormon," he replies by way of tendering a resignation.) Then it's back home to Georgetown . Osborne barely has time to hit the vodka before his nightmare wife Katie (Tilda Swinton ) embroils him in her frenzied preparations for the evening's cocktail party—whose guests include her ex–Secret Serviceman lover, Harry Pfarrer  (George Clooney ).
Although initially too crazed to focus on hubby's catastrophe, Katie is soon sneaking off for a divorce consultation, while Osborne seeks consolation in the idea of punishing the CIA with a tell-all memoir. He lounges around the basement, dictating his book into a tape recorder, when he's not watching Family Feud  or attending a boozy Princeton  reunion. Somehow, some of it winds up on a computer disc, and, at length, the Coens introduce their final complication: Linda Litzke  (Frances McDormand ) and Chad Feldheimer (Brad Pitt ), two employees at the Hard Bodies gym who discover Osborne's disc and embark upon a comically bungled—but inevitably and increasingly violent—shakedown.
Say this for the Coen aesthetic: There's nothing these boys can't hold up to ridicule. Murder—the more cold-blooded, the better—is usually a laugh line; anti-Semitic stereotypes were played for yocks in Barton Fink  ; lynching was a gag in O Brother, Where Art Thou?  McDormand, who is married to Joel Coen  and, once upon a time in Fargo  , played one of the few likable characters in the Coen oeuvre, is relentlessly punished here. It's the brothers' heartfelt nihilism that made No Country for Old Men  so convincing. As long as it looks good . . .
Which, in this case, it does. Burn After Reading  maps a world of spies, cheats, and schemers, with everyone under some sort of surveillance and every dog chasing its own tail. The conspiracy here is one of dunces, or as Osborne exclaims upon surprising one intruder in his basement: "You're part of a league of morons!" Each of the five principals is a broadly played, dim-witted grotesque wearing his or her own distinctively stricken kabuki mask. Clooney plays dumb and Pitt plays dumber, but—pop-eyed and motor-mouthed, her every facial twitch seemingly prompted by an off-screen cattle prod—McDormand is triumphantly dumbest as a ridiculously self-assured nudnik obsessed with financing a complete surgical makeover. Swinton's scary shrew, revealed in one of the movie's funniest gags as the world's meanest pediatrician, is restrained by comparison, as is Malkovich's increasingly hysterical old-school spook, complete with polka-dot bow tie. To provide further comic distance, everything is reported back to an incredulous CIA chief (Juno's dad, J.K. Simmons ), who orchestrates the necessary cover-up.
Still, ethics more than aesthetics demand that a successful Coen film—namely The Big Lebowski —include at least one minimally sympathetic link on its chain of fools. Clooney's amiably rancid charm doesn't quite serve; hence, Burn After Reading  is a comedy without consequences. "Jesus, what a clusterfuck!" Simmons exclaims, cueing the Coens' camera to beat a hasty retreat back into outer space. It's the last word, and the blurb that Burn After Reading  deserves.
