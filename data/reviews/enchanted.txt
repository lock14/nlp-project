In "Enchanted," Amy Adams smiles like the sort of maiden you'd find on a butter wrapper or some fancy heavy cream. She's sweet and charmingly seductive. You may not need any cream, but the woman's so pretty you'd toss a container in your cart anyway. She also demonstrates a real performer's ingenuity for comic timing and physical eloquence (her big eyes pop, and she signals melodrama by swaying her arms like Lillian Gish). The sight of Adams gliding and beaming and chirping in this movie - a self-mocking cartoon that transforms into an inspired live-action musical farce - is just about the happiest time I've had watching an actor do anything all year.
That's partially because I was watching something I hadn't seen in a long, long time: an honest-to-goodness movie star brightening an actual movie. In this case, the occasion is extra-special since before "Enchanted" Adams was simply that nice Oscar nominee from "Junebug." Here she becomes a star before our eyes, and it's like witnessing an entire garden grow in under two hours.
Directed by Kevin Lima and written by Bill Kelly, the movie jabs at the virtuousness of the old Disney cartoons for laughs. It actually happens to be a Disney picture, but the company doesn't bite its own hand. It pats itself on the back for having a sense of humor about the ancient wholesome values of its animated legacy ("Sleeping Beauty," "The Little Mermaid," etc. come in for mild ribbing).
Adams plays Giselle, a fairy-tale heroine who, on her wedding day, is sent down a well and through some kind of wormhole into Disneyfied Times Square. The sender is an evil queen (Susan Sarandon under a lot of dark hair and makeup). Giselle is distraught and confused, galloping in a billowing white gown and pounds of red hair on the bustling Broadway sidewalks trying to figure out what's happened.
I knew the movie was in the right spirit when Giselle, in that immaculate dress, plops herself down on a dirty street at the feet of a bum. The movie maintains a great tension between the sanitation of her cartoon world and the dirtiness of New York. Before Robert, a divorce attorney played by Patrick Dempsey, agrees to put Giselle up in the roomy Upper West Side apartment he shares with his daughter, Morgan (Rachel Covey), he asks her where she'll sleep. Giselle requests a hollow tree or a meadow. (You'll have to hear Adams say it.)
At one point Giselle opens a window to summon her cute woodland critters to help her clean Robert's pigsty apartment. She's expecting ladybirds and fawns. She gets assorted vermin. Without a second thought, she breaks into a blissful song (by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz) and tidies up with her unsavory but effective maintenance crew. That sequence and another even more impressive musical number in Central Park are marvels of assurance. The filmmakers trust us to find the irony funny without once asking Adams or any of the energetic extras to wink at us, the way a Mel Brooks version of the same material might. After she gleefully makes herself clothes out of Robert's curtains and rugs, the cutaway holes shaped like dresses get a big laugh.
"Enchanted" is still fun when it leaves Adams and goes to James Marsden, as Edward, the prince who jumps through the wormhole, along with his crooked helpmeet (Timothy Spall) and a chipmunk, to rescue Giselle. Marsden flings his hair enough for it to be considered a workout routine and wears a jacket with such balloon shoulders you half-expect Richard Branson to commandeer one of them. But with a job as tough as Adams's, he transcends his props, enthusiastically playing this dolt with panache and valiance. Edward doesn't know he's a joke.
Innocence may be the movie's gag, but "Enchanted" isn't a send-up of virtue. Giselle and Edward get mocked but the movie doesn't work if we don't believe that those two believe in stuff like "true love's kiss." News of divorce gives Giselle a conniption. But the movie actually starts to run out of gas toward the finale when it introduces Giselle to the concept of dating and has her embark on a "Pretty Woman" shopping spree (she was better in drapes) then straighten out her piles of hair.
Incidentally, "Pretty Woman" remains the standard by which star-making is measured. That's mostly because since 1990 stardom no longer has much real currency. It's cheap bordering on meaningless. Tabloids, the Internet, and reality television have taken the mystery of out being a star. And would-be movie stars, like Ben Affleck, Jennifer Lopez, and Angelina Jolie, never quite took the "movie" part seriously in the first place. The audience, in turn, has come to distrust it, too - we know far too much about these people to surrender fully to them.
So Amy Adams is breathtaking almost by default: Who is she again? Her mesmerizing lightness seems like a condition of this character and a personal matter of fact: She brings no baggage to the part. The rub, of course, is that while a lot of people walking into "Enchanted" won't know who Adams is, they'll leave clamoring to find out.


Giselle (delectable Amy Adams) is a princess ejected from her magic kingdom by a curse from her evil potential mother-in-law (Susan Sarandon) in the inspired Disney fairy-tale mash-up Enchanted . And when the heroine pops up in New York City, dazed by her transformation from animated  cartoon girl to live-action beauty, she's put up for the night by a stranger, a harried divorce lawyer  (Patrick Dempsey). But there's a hygiene problem. He's the distracted single parent to a little girl (Rachel Covey), his girlfriend (Idina Menzel) is on his case for more commitment  and with no time to clean, his apartment is a mess. So Giselle does what any classically trained, sweet-natured  Disney heroine would do: With a lilting yodel, she summons her charmed animal friends to help her tidy up, and they sing, sing, sing while they toil. Of course, this being New York, the wildlife workforce consists of rats, pigeons, mice, and well-organized cockroaches.
The hilarious ''Happy Working Song '' production number, with music and lyrics by Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz, encapsulates the joys of Enchanted   an unironic affection for classic Disney fairy tales of old, salted with modern smarts about how the non-Disney world really works for single parents, kids, working women,  divorce lawyers, and cockroaches. Somewhere deep in the movie's genetic structure is a chromosome or two of Rocky and Bullwinkle's bi-level wit mixed in with the DNA of Mary Poppins . The resourceful heroine is soul sister to Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White, and as such she comes accessorized with a handsome fairy-tale prince (Hairspray 's James Marsden, wonderfully earnest, and therefore charming, as a princely dolt). But New York works its own magic on Giselle  and so does Lawyer McDreamy.
Enchanted  is festooned with extravagant set pieces  there's a great number in praise of romantic gestures, and a ballroom scene to make even grown-up girls swoon. So I hope no one thinks me a mean stepsister when I say that the movie is also one baggy final act too long, as Sarandon's whole evil-older-woman subplot climaxes with a technically showy but really dragging chase and rescue sequence of a King Kong  kind. An old queen ought to know when to step aside and let the next Disney generation claim the crown.

 The movies like to promise girls and women a happily ever after,  but it’s unusual that one delivers an ending that makes you feel unsullied and uncompromised, that doesn’t make you want to reach for your Simone de Beauvoir or a Taser. “Enchanted,” an unexpectedly delightful revisionist fairy tale from, of all places, Walt Disney Pictures, doesn’t radically rewrite  every bummer cliché about girls of all ages and their dreams. But for a satisfying stretch, the film works  its magic largely by sending up, at times with a wink, at times with a hard nudge, some of the very stereotypes that have long been this company’s profitable stock in trade.  It’s a gently heretical redo, characterized by a script that   falters only  in the clinch, some agile if overly timid direction and a strong cast led by a  superb Amy Adams. As Giselle,   an otherworldly princess who falls to Earth (worse yet, Times Square), Ms. Adams proves to be an irresistibly watchable screen presence and a felicitous physical comedian, with a gestural performance and an emotional register that alternately bring to mind the madcap genius of Carole Lombard and Lucille Ball. Ms. Adams doesn’t just bring her cartoonish character to life: she fills Giselle’s pale cheeks with blood and feeling, turning a hazardously cute gimmick into a recognizable, very appealing human confusion of emotion and crinoline.  The once upon a time begins with the animated Giselle,  a pastel creation with a pointy chin and trilling voice, merrily chattering with her furry and feathered woodland friends. Although she isn’t scrubbing down the front steps in rags and clogs, Giselle has clearly been conceived, more thematically than visually, along the same lines as  classic Disney heroines  like  Snow White and Cinderella. She’s pretty, she’s perky, she’s flat (well, not entirely), and when she sings about her one true love,  it isn’t long before he emerges on horseback, answering her call with a Stephen Schwartz and Alan Menken refrain of his own. Hi ho, hi ho, it’s off to the chapel they would go if not for  his wicked,  witchy stepmother.  One thing quickly leads to another until Giselle tumbles down a well and lands in New York, her drawn figure  suddenly made flesh. There, amid the bustling and hustling, she finds shelter with a guarded single father, Robert (Patrick Dempsey), and his motherless daughter, Morgan (Rachel Covey). Melodrama looms, mostly and somewhat unfairly because of another woman (Idina Menzel), but the director Kevin Lima keeps the tone light and playful while also scaling some charmingly dizzy heights with two musical numbers, one a rousing, complexly choreographed song and dance in Central Park with what looks like the entire Broadway dance corps, the other a brilliantly surrealistic number with Giselle and some urban critters. You may never look at a water bug the same way again.  In some ways  the film   never recovers from the anarchic joys  of this particular musical number, which is so flat-out bizarre and grotesquely funny — and executed straight, without knowing smirks — that it threatens to send the story off the rails. Part of this number’s  pleasure comes from the naughty thrill of watching a beloved, near-sacred film — in this case, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” Disney’s sublime first animated feature — gleefully turned upside down and inside out. The old Warner Brothers animators used to take rollicking aim at Disney on occasion, but it’s something else to watch Disney send up Disney, as it were, and do it with such sneaky,  breezy irreverence. It’s “Snow White” as redone by John Waters.  It would be too much to expect Disney to wholly dismantle  its own mythologies, thereby freeing young female hearts and minds from the curse of Prince Charming, so it’s no surprise that “Enchanted”  trips up  on its way to the finish. The windup disappoints, as does Susan Sarandon’s Queen Narissa, who enters in a bilious puff as if dressed for a fetish ball. The queen  arrives blessedly late to a party that lasts a remarkably long time, in part because of the dunderheaded Prince Edward (an excellent James Marsden), a crafty fly in the ointment (the equally stellar Timothy Spall) and a  computer-generated chipmunk called Pip (voiced by Mr. Lima and Jeff Bennett).  I’d gladly tell you about Pip’s close call with crucifixion, but I don’t want to scare the children.    “Enchanted” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Pigeons and rats and water bugs, oh my.

"Enchanted" more than lives up to its title. A full-blown musical that commutes between Disney's patented cartoon universe and the "real" world with cleverness and grace, this splashy production reminds one of nothing in the Disney canon so much as "Mary Poppins," not least due to the "star is born" aura that surrounds Amy Adams here, just as it did Julie Andrews 43 years ago. Comparison between the two films will certainly extend to their popularity, as the new one will please nearly all audiences all the time on its flight to the place where B.O. dreams come true.
The central conceit of Bill Kelly's nifty script is to toss Disney's trustiest fairy tale characters -- the sweet-as-sugar princess, the straight-arrow prince, the evil queen and a menagerie of affectionately frisky critters -- from their bucolic natural setting onto the streets of Manhattan and take it from there. This being "New" York, the characters aren't in danger of being plunked down in the middle of "Mean Streets" or "Across 110th Street"; indeed, when they pop out of a manhole in the middle of the theater district, accoutered in flouncy medieval garb, it's a wonder the many gawking bystanders don't just assume they're refugees from a Disney Broadway production, which "Enchanted" is sure to become down the line.
Opening 12 minutes, which are delightfully animated in vintage hand-drawn style, set the tone of loving send-up by packing in as many of the old Disney cliches as possible. In Andalasia, a land clearly afflicted by severe animal over-population, the ditzily innocent Giselle sings of the "True Love's Kiss" she expects to receive from the soon-to-arrive Prince Edward, son of Queen Narissa. Unwilling to be dethroned if Edward marries, Narissa transforms herself into a dreadful old crone and pushes Giselle down a well, sending her to a place "where there are no happily-ever-afters."
Confronting the noise and concrete and congestion of Manhattan, wide-eyed Giselle (Adams) arrives clueless, not to mention penniless. Dithering around town in an absurdly hooped wedding dress, she winds up rain soaked in the Bowery, where she attracts the attention of 6-year-old Morgan (Rachel Covey). Latter's divorced dad Robert (Patrick Dempsey), a divorce lawyer himself, rescues the damsel in distress and lets her spend the night at their apartment, albeit with misgivings, as he's about to ask his g.f. Nancy (Idina Menzel) to marry him.
As the gee-whiz, fish-out-of-water reactions of an animation-world alien can't sustain interest for too long, pic quickly shows what it's got up its sleeve in a hilarious variation on "Whistle While You Work" called "Happy Working Song." Confronting the horrible mess of Robert's domicile in the morning, Giselle summons the city's animals to help her tidy it up, and the place is soon jammed with wonderfully rendered CGI pigeons, rats, mice and cockroaches, which enthusiastically whip the place into shape.
In short order, vainglorious Prince Edward (James Marsden) arrives in Manhattan, sword in hand, to rescue his beloved, followed by Nathaniel (Timothy Spall), the queen's portly factotum, who comically bungles any number of attempts to eliminate Giselle once and for all. Another Andalasian transplant is a hyperactive chipmunk who keeps trying, and failing, to communicate to Edward what he ought to do.
As Giselle initially persists in speaking in storybook homilies about her prince and true love, it's no wonder Robert remarks, "It's like you escaped from a Hallmark card." Despite the adversity of her situation, it's all sweetness and light to her until Robert provokes her by insisting no fairy-tale prince will be coming to rescue her. Roused to anger for the first time in her life, Giselle begins to become a real, more dimensional person, a development soon complicated by the stirring of feelings between her and Robert.
While Kelly's script and Kevin Lima's direction may not rep the last word in brilliance, the creative forces behind the film are uniformly alert, cheeky and smart in the ways of popular entertainment. More than Disney's strictly animated product, "Enchanted," in the manner of the vast majority of Hollywood films made until the '60s, is a film aimed at the entire population -- niches be damned. It simply aims to please, without pandering, without vulgarity, without sops to pop-culture fads, and to pull this off today is no small feat.
But even with all the other pieces in place -- the knowing craftsmanship, Alan Menken and Stephen Schwartz's engaging songs (there are five original tunes), the sharp animation, the spiffy Gotham locations and a couple outrageously unexpected animal gags -- the picture wouldn't be what it is without Adams. Just as Andrews arrived at just the right time for "Mary Poppins" and "The Sound of Music," so has Adams turned up almost out of nowhere (her wonderful work in "Junebug" notwithstanding) to be crowned the fairest in the land. (In a nice if fleeting touch, Andrews was recruited to provide brief opening and closing narration.)
With the evident instincts of a born musical-comedy performer and a lovely voice to back them up, the red-haired, bright-eyed Adams proves more charming the more disheveled she becomes, and exercises comic gifts in the process that call to mind such immortals as Carole Lombard and Lucille Ball. An utterly convincing spokeswoman for innocence, her Giselle for a long time brooks no dissent from her innately optimistic worldview, so when she blossoms into a real woman, if such she can be called, the opening of emotional dimensions is palpable. Enchanting is the word.
Prominently back on the bigscreen again due to his success in TV's "Grey's Anatomy," Dempsey does a nice, understated job as a harried single dad you don't mind pulling for. Marsden, who, like Adams, boasts a startlingly good singing voice, has and imparts a grand time as the self-regarding prince, while Susan Sarandon turns up in fully cranked Cruella de Vil mode when the queen comes to New York herself to dispatch Giselle once and for all; Rick Baker's old-hag makeup for her climactic disguise is flat-out great.
The skillfully produced and mounted picture makes massive use of Manhattan as a glorious backdrop; it may be a touristic view of the city, but this is perhaps fitting, given that it's about visitors. The extensive scenes involving countless cars and extras must have tied up traffic for days, and the logistics surrounding other scenes on the Brooklyn Bridge, the Upper West Side, Columbus Circle and elsewhere had to have been nearly as daunting.
Most striking, however, is a prolonged production number, "That's How You Know," that moves through many sections of Central Park and employs dozens or more musicians, dancers and backgrounders. It's hard to think of a traditional musical number done on such a scale since the '60s, so it's startling to behold. Like the rest of the film, the sequence reaches far back into the past for its inspiration and manages to make it feel like something new again.

Hard to believe that it's been 20 years since the release of The Princess Bride , if only because it hasn't aged a day. Bereft of the pop-culture gags that curdle the Shrek   movies and absent the cynicism of most other kids' films used solely to peddle fast food and impulse items, it remains a spellbinding experiencea fractured fairy tale spastic with ironic twitches that melt away beneath the joy and warmth with which Rob Reiner  and William Goldman  tell their story. And it's even more special because The Princess Bride is one of the few truly great movies that a parent can watch with a young child; never once does the grown-up satire strangle the swashbuckling romance. Better still, there's nothing formulaic or silly about itcharges that Pauline Kael  leveled at children's cinema in a mid-'60s essay about how Walt Disney had ruined movies for kids by peddling "pacifiers" to them so their parents could zone out for 90 minutes.
The trailer for Disney 's new Enchanted   at least suggested that it aspired to Princess Bride greatness; if nothing else, it didn't look like something concocted in a test lab. The premise had promise: Characters from a "vintage" Disney movie suddenly find themselves thrust into our worldTimes Square , to be precise, long a retrofitted, sterilized amusement park anyway. Disney, referencing everything from Fantasia  to Toy Story in the advertisements, has sold the film as something both smartly postmodern and decidedly old-fashioned: merry maidens serenade white-collar princes, who joust with MTA  buses as wicked witches unleash fire-breathing dragons on midtown high-rises.
But somewhere between conception and execution, what could have been so much smart, sharp fun turned decidedly pedestrian. Director Kevin Lima  has made lousy Disney movies before2000's 102 Dalmatians , most recently, one in a long line of unnecessary and loathsome Disney sequels that squeezed every last penny out of those puppies. Enchanted , though, isn't even something to get worked up overnot only because it's so boring, but because it can't even be bothered to adhere to its own internal logic. And while that may not sound like a big dealeven a little nitpickywhen your movie's got but a single gag, you have to tell the joke right.
Enchanted   fails from its very first moments, as Julie Andrews  (aw  . . .) narrates the opening animated sequence about a girl named Giselle (voiced by Amy Adams ) who, as she's being dressed by a mélange of woodland critters, pines for a Prince Charming to sweep her off her tired feet. The animation's meant to look oldDisney, circa 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs . But instead it looks shabby and shoddyDisney, circa 2002's direct-to-video Cinderella II: Dreams Come True .
Giselle meets and sings with hunky Prince Edward (James Marsden ), whose evil mommy, Queen Narissa (Susan Sarandon ), is none too pleased about a commoner taking her throne. So the queen, who's also a witch, dispatches Giselle to the Real World, the entranceway to which is a sewer that runs through Times Square. Before long, Giselle, now played by Adams in the flesh, rescues a divorce attorney named Robert (Patrick Dempsey ), who has little time for the whimsical or romantic. Which doesn't stop him from taking in Giselle and allowing her to sleep on his couch, in the same apartment he shares with his six-year-old daughter Morgan (Rachel Covey ). Because there aren't crazy people running around New York claiming to be princesses. Not at all.
The movie crumbles to teeny bits the next morning, when Giselle summons New York's indigenous wildlifechiefly rats and pigeonsto clean Robert's nasty apartment, just as she'd done in the animated sequence. So the real world is apparently no different than the cartoon one? This obliterates the gag entirely. If a cartoon character can make magic in this  world, what's the rush in getting home?
