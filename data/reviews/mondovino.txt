Early in Jonathan Nossiter's Mondovino , we meet Aimé Guibert, a white-haired vintner in the south of France who surveys his calling with the cynical resign of a horse-and-buggy driver in 1910. ''Wine is dead,'' he says, his features drooping into a scowl of sadness. A little later, we meet the killers of wine  that is, if you agree with Guibert's elegy. They are Robert Mondavi, who starting in 1966 probably did more than anyone to plant Napa Valley on the world-vintage map, and his eldest son, Michael. In Mondovino , winemakers from half a dozen countries are filmed with a handheld camera that ambles its way through their vineyards and homes, but Nossiter poses the Mondavis in a single still frame, so that they look as sinister as the Corleones. The film seems to be saying: These are the capitalist oligarchs of the New Wine Order.
As we learn, the Mondavis tried  and failed  to take over a vineyard in Aniane, the only village in France with a Communist mayor. (Guibert, who lives there, helped to lead the fight against them.) It was a Pyrrhic victory for the old ways, though. Mondovino , a look at the changing world of wine and what it says about all of us, is a searching meditation on love, flavor, money, tradition, and globalization. We meet a number of European winemakers, disciples of the mysteries of old-oak barrels and terroir, and several of the new oligarchs as well, like Michel Rolland, a jaunty wine consultant who hops all over the globe doling out expensive tips on the science of micro-oxygenation.
If Mondovino  were simply a tale of ancient artisans versus the corporation, it might have been a reductive movie. But Nossiter, who made the stirring lost-souls-in-love drama Sunday (1997), finds ripples of subtlety within his design. We meet the fabled critic Robert Parker, whose reviews in the Wine Advocate determine prices around the world. Is he the Pied Piper of globalized taste, shoring up American dominance, or is he right about the sensations he champions? The highest praise I can give to Mondovino  is that it makes you want to sample every vintage it shows you and find out the answer yourself.

ine  is  more than a beverage.  It is, proverbially, the soul of a meal and, in some accounts, the very cornerstone of civilization, which is one of the reasons I prefer beer. Innocent talk of noses and finishes, therefore, has a way of  drifting toward headier matters.  Intoxicated though he is by the rolling, hilly landscapes of Napa, Tuscany and Languedoc,  Jonathan Nossiter, in his new documentary, "Mondovino," is more interested in the sobering facts of global marketing, economic competition and cultural imperialism. As it has made its way across Europe (after being shown at the Cannes Film Festival last spring), "Mondovino" has trailed controversy behind it, and the debate is likely to continue now that it has arrived in this country.  Part of what it is about, after all, is the cultural tension between the new world and the old - between crusty, fatalistic French peasants and smooth-faced, forward-looking Californians. In many ways, the battle being played out in the vineyards -  between European (but especially French) particularism and a global consumerism driven by American ideas about marketing and brand awareness -  echoes other, similar skirmishes; for instance, about movies themselves. At times, the quarrel pitting partisans of "terroir"  -  that mysterious sensory quality by which wine supposedly evokes the climate and history of its place of origin -  against the proponents of an equally mysterious process called micro-oxygenation, recalls the rhetorical warfare of the French "cin�ma des auteurs" against the blockbuster mentality of Hollywood. But in wine, as in movies, things are not so black (or do I mean red?) and white. Some of the most energetic proponents of vino-globalization (mondovinismo?) are French, many of them concentrated in Bordeaux. One of the film's most flamboyant figures -  and perhaps its designated villain -  is Michel Rolland, a fast-moving consultant who motors around the countryside in a chauffeured sedan, cigarillo and cellphone in hand, preaching the gospel of new oak and big flavor. Among his allies are the Mondavi family of California and the well-known wine critic Robert Parker, whose ratings allegedly have the power to propel some wines to international prestige. Arrayed against these avatars of jet-set, high-end wine marketing are stubborn, old-style growers like Hubert de Montille, a marvelously cranky philosopher of the grape, and Aim� Guibert, who declares that "wine is dead" but nonetheless revels in his successful crusade to prevent the Mondavis from developing some land near his vineyards. Mr. Nossiter covers a lot of ground, roaming from Bordeaux to Napa, from Sardinia to South America. He is an enthusiastic interviewer, proficient in several languages and able to put people at ease with his air of smiling, unassuming curiosity. His editing style is less ingratiating, though, as he repeats the same points over and over and stacks the deck to suit his political   assumptions. One of his favorite ploys is to scan the walls behind his interlocutors' heads for an incriminating detail, which usually takes the form of a signed picture of Ronald Reagan. The ideological subtext of "Mondovino" is perhaps more complex than Mr. Nossiter would allow, but there is no doubt that wine talk can become pretty heated. Mr. Parker, who views himself as a plain-spoken American democrat, is among the least inflammatory. Others indulge in unapologetic hyperbole. "It's not the traditionalists versus the modernists," says Neal Rosenthal, a New York importer who decries the "Napaization" of the world's vintages. "It's the collaborators against the resistance." Not to be outdone, a Bordeaux executive refers to Mr. Rosenthal's ilk as "ayatollahs of terroir." Tim Mondavi makes much of the fact that the mayor who stopped the Mondavi family's project in Mr. Guibert's neighborhood was a Communist. He does not mention that the man's predecessor, who supported the project, was a Socialist. The glorious history of the French left, it seems, has come to this: a Socialist is someone who supports transnational investment, while a Communist intervenes to protect the interests of landowners. Vive la diff�rence. Mr. Nossiter's presentation takes at face value Mr. de Montille and Mr. Guibert's view that they represent authenticity and tradition against crass consumerism, and it is possible to sympathize without being entirely persuaded. An interview with Michael Broadbent, a London auctioneer with a chalk-striped suit and an accent out of P. G. Wodehouse, recalls that the prestige of first-growth French wine arose in an earlier era of marketing and international trade, albeit one that was much more restricted. One of the unexamined ironies of this smart, sincere and sloppy film is its assumption that the tastes of the imperial British aristocracy of the 19th century were not only superior to those of the 21st-century American middle class but also friendlier to the enduring values of civilization. I don't know much about wine, but to me that leaves a funny aftertaste. "Mondovino" is rated PG-13 (Parental guidance suggested), for strong language and scenes of wine drinking.
Wine is more than once extolled as the essence of civilization in Jonathan Nossiter 's DV documentary Mondovino . The major point of this vineyard marathon is that civilization is inexorably succumbing to the homogenizing forces of globalization. Mondovino  is mainly bathed in Mediterranean light, but the movie justifies its travelogue title with jaunts to California and northeast Brazil. Nossiter hangs out in Sardinia  and accompanies the "flying winemaker," superstar consultant Michel Rolland , on a number of lightning house calls, during which he invariably advises his clients to "micro-oxygenate" their product (a process that no one quite appears to understand). There's also an excursion to a humble vineyard in the Argentinean outback and a long interview with the Staglin family on their Napa  spread, complete with wooden dining table modeled on the one in Godfather II .
Also in Napa, Nossiter is told by a Mondavi family retainer that patriarch Robert is not simply a businessman but also a "philosopher." For his part, the cosmopolitan Nossiterwho won an award at Sundance for his 1997 drama Sunday is a sommelier as well as a filmmaker. There's passion to his championing artisanal, localized winesespecially those produced by colorful rustic eccentrics prone to gloomy assess ments like "Wine is dead . . . and  cheese . . . and fruit." Nossiter subscribes to the anti- globalist notion that terroir  literally soil , but more generally the site-specific geological qualities of a particular vineyardis more important than the label on the bottle. (The denunciation of merlot delivered by the antihero of Sideways might be seen as a related attack on merchandising, were he otherwise not so solipsistically devoted to California wines.)
Mondovino has its own particular terroir. The mode is jagged, informal, and highly personal. Nossiter frequently puts himself on-screen, and in an unarticulated running joke, never resists a close-up of some indulged canine slobbering over the cheese. (By their pets, you shall know them. Wine critic Robert Parker  is rendered all the more memorable by his flatulent bulldog.) The handheld camera, slightly saturated colors, and constant wine chat provide a mildly inebriated feel that, given the movie's rambling structure and leisurely length, slides easily into disorientation.
As an essay, Mondovino  has an arbitrary, patchwork feel. The U.S. release version is at least a half-hour shorter than the cut that was shown to mixed response last May in Cannes and Nossiter is preparing a 10-hour TV miniseries. What's constant in Nossiter's argument is the cross-cutting between the globalizers (Mondavi, Rolland, Parker) and the "terroirists" (the de Montilles of Burgundy, the Columbus  of Sardinia, New York importer Neal Rosenthal ). As presented by Nossiter, the Mondavis and their allies come across as megalomaniacal. But aren't they also democratizing the wine "experience"? Rolland, who laughingly blames diversity for the number of bad wines, believes that great wine can be made anywhereand by the time the movie ends one of the younger Mondavis is dreaming of making wine on Mars.
Not everything is black and white. (Son of a Mosel wine grower, the young Karl Marx  wrote one of his first articles exposing the exploitation of vineyard workers, although that never complicated his own taste for the grape.) Good terroir does not necessarily make for impeccable morality. Some French old-timers dissipate viewer sympathy with offhandedly disinterested references to their Jewish neighbors who disappeared during World War II. Likewise, the Tuscan aristos complain that they sold their birthright to the multinationals and then wax nostalgic for Mussolini , while certain French foes of Mondavi-dom are only too happy to have homeboy Gérard Depardieu  fronting some other globalization thing. (And even the Mondavis, it turns out, can be purged from the company that they founded.)
Understandably unhappy that his unguarded pronouncements and gleeful demeanor make him seem like a hustler, Rolland has attacked Nossiter as a crass trickster rigging his argument with Spielbergistic special effects. But Nossiter's temperament as a filmmaker (if not his craft) is closer to Renoirit's all about the light, the long takes, and the ensemble cast, as well as the willingness to allow that everyone has their reasons. Nossiter has an eye for stray details and a knack for relaxing his subjects although the scene with the naked guy trampling his own grapes may make you sorry that you ever gave up drinking Ripple.
