"Notes on a Scandal" is a nice mug of poisoned eggnog for the holiday season -- a movie so smart and entertaining you almost don't feel its chill sicken your bones. Those who know the novels of Patricia Highsmith and Ruth Rendell may recognize the movie's antiheroine as belonging to a select company of warped souls. Others can take this elegant creep-out as a British take on "Fatal Attraction," minus the boiled bunnies.
Above all, "Notes" offers yet another stunning Judi Dench performance, this one crabbed and mean and surprising. Her character, the aptly named Barbara Covett, is a history teacher at a rough-and-tumble London boys' school. She has been there far too long and has become a fixture: the prim, cultured dragon lady who inspires fear and grudging respect. "Children are feral," she snaps at one point, and clearly she hates the little beasts. She doesn't think much of the grown-ups, either.
Into Barbara's world swims Sheba Hart (Cate Blanchett), a disheveled but glamorous new art teacher. "Hard to read the wispy novice," the older woman writes in her diary. "Is she an artist or simply stupid?" A bit of both, it turns out.
Adapted from Zoë Heller's well-regarded 2003 novel "What Was She Thinking? (Notes on a Scandal)," the movie is about discreet obsessions spiraling out of control and proper British behavior going all to hell. Sheba is happily married to an older man, a professor named Richard (the always welcome Bill Nighy); they have a teenage daughter (Juno Temple) and a young son with Down syndrome (Max Lewis). Against all common sense -- which is the attraction, really -- Sheba finds herself drawn to a 15-year-old student named Steven (Andrew Simpson).
Bad form, you say? You don't know the half of it. Barbara comes to learn of her new friend's secret, and "Notes on a Scandal" embarks on an eerie, unsettling dance of manipulation and vengefulness. What does Sheba want? Only to be young again. What does Barbara want? Something more than a friend. Simple things, but they lead both women into monstrousness.
The movie's an odd hybrid: a highbrow suspense freak-out. The screenwriter is Patrick Marber, whose play and script for "Closer" negotiated similar hairpin turns of venality and need, and the director is Richard Eyre, the British theater veteran whose second career as a filmmaker is looking better and better. Eyre directed Dench in "Iris," but "Notes" is a shallower, trickier piece of work.
As in the book, Barbara's diary entries serve as unreliable narration, but here we actually see the widening gap between her perceptions and reality. The gambit works because the observations are so juicily nasty -- "They do things rather differently in bourgeois bohemia," Barbara sniffs after a loosey-goosey dinner at the Harts' -- but also because they build, bit by bit, into a portrait of a desperately lonely monomaniac. Some might read the character as a lesbian caricature, but she's too deluded for that. Barbara can't even see the closet, let alone all that's hanging in it.
There are moments of tension to make you crawl up the back of your seat: Barbara, insane with grief over the death of a pet, insisting Sheba mourn with her right now
 or she'll tell Richard everything. Barbara asking if she can stroke Sheba's arms, just as the girls did back in boarding school. Simpson's young student is a smiling adolescent satyr, as much seducer as victim, and Blanchett's Sheba is a fool we understand, even as we shrink in disgust. A movie like this needs a pillar of sanity, too, and that's Nighy.
That said, it's Dench's movie. The character's a fully realized conception, in the ciggie smoking that offends her crunchy peers, in the secret thrill she takes in Sheba's transgression, in the strict order she maintains in her little life, lest the walls come crashing down. They do anyway.
The one mistake in "Notes on a Scandal" is its music: a Philip Glass score that tootles loudly in the usual circles and pushes the film toward a horror movie that's not happening, at least not in a way to which we're accustomed. The great Glass score you're looking for is "The Illusionist"; this one is more obvious than anything that happens onscreen.
The appropriate music for a story like this would probably be variations on "What I Did for Love," each more atonal than the last. You'll want to take a shower after "Notes on a Scandal," but you'll be glad you got dirty.


 The claws draw blood in “Notes on a Scandal,” a misanthropic game of cat and mouse from which no one emerges unscathed, including saps like us who think  we’re watching a film about other people. Based on the novel “What Was She Thinking?: Notes on a Scandal” by the British writer Zoë Heller, the film stars Judi Dench and Cate Blanchett as colleagues nearly undone by desire.  Ms. Dench plays Barbara, an unmarried teacher with a dedicated fondness for vulnerable women of the sort personified by Ms. Blanchett’s Sheba,  a married art teacher who has just joined her secondary school. Barbara wants Sheba, but what Sheba likes, wants and eventually gets is a 15-year-old boy with a downy chin and knowing smile.  What is “Notes on a Scandal”? Well, for starters, it is a painstakingly classy package. The film’s director, Richard Eyre, ran   the  National Theater in London, and the screenwriter, Patrick Marber, wrote the  play  “Closer,” which became something of a bigger cultural event when Mike Nichols decided to transpose it to the screen. (The composer for this film, doodle-doodle-doodle, is Philip Glass.) The actors in “Notes on a Scandal” are equally distinguished: Ms. Dench  and Ms. Blanchett are among the finest  on the market today, and each can deliver expert performances,  even when, as is the case here, their roles are false and hollow. The performers sell the goods, but the goods are cheap.  Among the cheapest is Barbara Covett, an unmarried, bristly woman of a certain age, vague sexuality and clichéd contour: think sensible shoes, regrettable hair, tweedy skirts, “The Children’s Hour,” Gertrude and Alice. Much like the title character in Patricia Highsmith’s shiver-inducing novel “Edith’s Diary,” Barbara keeps a journal that serves her needs rather than the truth. In time, Edith goes completely around the bend. Barbara hasn’t arrived there yet, and though she’s well on her way, the filmmakers initially try to keep the news under wraps. An early scene of her publicly showing up the school’s fatuous principal with withering efficiency seems intended to make Barbara appear not just rational, but also a no-nonsense holdover who refuses to be gulled by New Age types and their feelings.  The entrance of the beautifully disheveled Sheba Hart changes everything. Like a tornado, she sweeps into the school and instantly upends everything, including Barbara. At first  the older woman offers some resistance. She scrutinizes Sheba as if examining a pinned butterfly and criticizes her youthful attire in a voice-over that, like her put-down of the principal, appears calculated to win our sympathies if not our affection.  Sheba’s apparent kindness and solicitous  behavior  soon melt Barbara’s reserve and her resistance. Small gestures of friendship and shared lunches ensue. By the time Sheba invites her new colleague to lunch at her house, the floodgates have opened completely. Barbara’s diary entries  and heart swell with mounting passion and hope, noisily telegraphed by Mr. Glass’s serial intrusiveness.  The plot thickens after Barbara meets Sheba’s much older husband, Richard (Bill Nighy, the reliably entertaining), and two demanding children. Sheba confesses to Barbara that she yearns for something more than domestic comfort and puttering around in her workshop. This confession, Richard’s age and the entire scene inspire Barbara’s contempt: “They do things differently in bourgeois bohemia,” she confides to us in voice-over while dining with the outwardly loving family. But as Barbara eyeballs Sheba dancing in her living room, her long torso swaying seductively to the music, it’s very obvious that she would be happy to put her prejudices aside. She gets her chance when, not long after, she discovers Sheba sexually servicing one of the high school students, Steven (Andrew Simpson), in  a classroom.  There are tears and a confession, murmurs and shouts, as Barbara realizes her advantage. She pounces, but Sheba’s lust for underage flesh  interferes with her plans. Slander, scandal and a conveniently dead cat add to the mix as the actresses plead their cases to the last row in the house.  Is this Judi’s film or Cate’s, Barbara’s or Sheba’s? Barbara inspires shudders and may be off her rocker;   Sheba is totally hot but also a sexual predator and, it emerges, rather stupid. Judi looks a fright, but that works to her actorly advantage as much as her marvelous enunciation. Cate slinks around,  soaking up male and female attention with confidence. Of course both characters are utterly despicable, as is the story that invites us into its trap just to prove that we all have our  self-serving reasons, including the filmmakers.  “Notes on a Scandal” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film contains crude language and scenes of an adult having sex with a minor.

Five years after their sensitive collaboration on "Iris," Richard Eyre guides Judi Dench to another pitch-perfect performance -- make that bitch-perfect -- in "Notes on a Scandal," a deviously entertaining account of one woman's indiscretions as related by a not-so-disinterested third party. If the results suggest a crafty British spin on the Mary Kay Letourneau saga, the riveting interplay between Dench and Cate Blanchett draws blood with every scene, thanks to a precision-honed script and Eyre's equally incisive direction. Dazzling star combo and appreciative reviews will prove especially enticing to older, literate audiences, yielding solid specialized returns for the Fox Searchlight pic.
Zoe Heller's compelling 2003 novel unraveled the sordid tale of a schoolteacher's affair with one of her young pupils, taking the form of a coolly perceptive and bitingly funny diary written by a close friend. The book's subversive achievement was to project the diarist's own gaze back upon herself, turning a salacious tabloid tale into a subtle and revelatory act of confession.
What Heller achieved through tricky literary technique, Eyre and scribe Patrick Marber ("Closer") have inevitably rendered more explicitly, playing up the obsessive lesbian-stalker angle with a discreet nod in the direction of "Fatal Attraction." What makes "Notes on a Scandal" more than just a Lifetime-ready psychothriller -- as well as a satisfyingly nasty awards-season tonic -- is the ruthless economy of its execution from start to finish.
From the outset, Dench's acerbic narration gives voice to the innermost thoughts of London schoolteacher Barbara Covett, a lonely spinster who reserves her bitter judgments of the world solely for her private journal and, by extension, the viewer. A juicy atmosphere of collusion thus established, Barbara begins to take an interest in Sheba Hart (Blanchett), the svelte, good-natured and very attractive woman who has just joined the faculty as an art teacher (and whose name is, not coincidentally, short for Bathsheba).
The two women become friends after Barbara gives the inexperienced Sheba a crash course in student discipline; in turn, Barbara is invited to lunch with Sheba, her significantly older husband Richard (a terrifically boisterous Bill Nighy), moody teenage daughter Polly (Juno Temple) and Down syndrome son Ben (Max Lewis).
With Barbara providing acid commentary on every detail, the film etches a fine-grained portrait of the Harts' bustling bourgeois lifestyle, with Blanchett ably conveying Sheba's love for her family as well as the quiet dissatisfaction of a woman who married too young and began her career too late.
Sheba's discontent becomes clear when Barbara peeks into her classroom after hours and spies the woman in a compromising position with one of her students, working-class Irish youth Steven Connolly (Andrew Simpson, unnervingly blurring the line between schoolboy innocence and sexual menace). Plot point reps a departure from the novel that makes Barbara a much more overtly malevolent figure, as the seeds of manipulation hinted at in the book become a full-throttle portrait of emotional blackmail.
Immediately, Barbara confronts Sheba, who, in a series of flashbacks, tearfully confesses the romantic entanglement that began with private tutorial sessions and culminated in messy trysts near the railroad tracks. Realizing the power she wields over her "friend," Barbara agrees to keep the affair a secret, though it's clear from her insinuating, creepily intimate manner that Sheba is still on thin ice.
Bravura sequence reps an impressively cinematic weave and shows an unfussy command of the material, from Marber's intensely focused adaptation -- much of the dialogue lifted from Heller's book, but pared down without losing its bite or character nuances -- to John Bloom and Antonia Van Drimmelen's tight editing and the sinister, weblike repetitions of Philip Glass' score.
But "Notes on a Scandal" is first and foremost an actors' showcase, and Dench rises ferociously to the occasion with her juiciest, most substantial performance since "Iris" and arguably "Mrs. Brown." Using her frumpy, diminutive stature as a weapon, Dench's Barbara invites the viewer (like Sheba) to pity her loneliness, so it registers as a genuine shock when she exposes the borderline-psychotic levels of neediness underneath.
Worlds away from her work in this year's "Babel" and "The Good German," Blanchett convinces utterly as the willowy, self-destructive Sheba. Thesp manages the tricky task of portraying the woman's actions as foolish and reckless while commanding one's sympathy, even understanding.
Eyre's veteran legit experience shows in a few scenes that barely steer clear of histrionics, particularly in the later going. But he doesn't hold back during the inevitable showdown between Dench and Blanchett, who happily pull out all the stops in a climactic scene that could have been even longer. Denouement strikes an abrupt but fitting note of muted creepiness.
Though not a period piece like Eyre's "Iris" and "Stage Beauty," pic's workaday settings have been outfitted with extreme care, from Tim Hatley's costumes to Caroline Smith's sets. Chris Menges' vibrant lensing generates a palpable heat, perfectly in keeping with the emotions roiling beneath this superbly executed thriller.

Notes on a Scandal , brilliantly adapted by Patrick Marber  from the darkly comic Zo Heller  novel, is a grim piece of work Fatal Attraction  for the art-house crowd, shorn of its predecessor's fearful misogyny. Set in a dreary London where a gray funk of fog and cigarette smoke hangs over everyone's head like a gathering storm, Notes  fits perfectly into Marber's milieua dank England populated by the miserable and the wretched, who go out of their way to make themselves and each other only more miserable and more wretched. Marber made even Julia Roberts , that ray of million-dollar sunshine, look gloomy and pitiful in Mike Nichols 's 2004 film Closer , which Marber adapted from his own play. Here, he works his dark magic on Cate Blanchett , playing a rookie prep-school art instructor blessed with the spirited name Bathsheba Hart  (or Sheba, as she likes to be called). Blanchett is a vision in thrift-store duds, a beauty tethered to a frustratingly middle-class existence with her slightly disheveled older husband (Bill Nighy ) and their two children, a snot-nosed daughter and a son with Down syndrome. Sheba imagined her life would be something more than this"Marriage and kids, it's wonderful, but it doesn't give you meaning," she tells the confidante who becomes her betrayer, played by Judi Dench and she's forever trying to reconcile the aching gap in her life, "the distance between life as you dream it and life as it is."
To fill the void, Sheba heads down a self-destructive path. An affair with a 15-year-old student named Steven (Andrew Simpson ) reminds her of the youth she feels she's squandered. That's never more evident than in a scene in Sheba's "summerhouse"which is actually just a workshop behind her suburban homewhen, after an afternoon of lovemaking, Steven picks up a copy of Sheba's favorite album, Kaleidoscope  by Siouxsie and the Banshees . Calling it "a masterpiece," Sheba talks of how listening to the album as a teenager made her feel "invincible," like Steven feels all the time. But then her boy lover puts on a wizard's hat Sheba made for her son, and she snapsfrom nostalgic reverie to guilt-stricken fear in the time it takes to draw a single breath. (In the introduction to the screenplay, Marber singles this out as one of his favorite scenes, in which Blanchett acts "with her nerve endings exposed.")
But Steven isn't the only one trying to woo Sheba. A friendless teacher at the school, Barbara Covett  (Dench), covets the pretty young thingas a friend, she would have us believe as our unreliable narrator. But as her friendship with Sheba blossomsfrom that of colleague to confidante to confessorBarbara documents each occasion in her diary with puppy-dog delight, dotting every last "i" with a giant red heart.
Marber and director Richard Eyre  (who directed Marber's earliest plays at the National Theatre in England) wisely let us in on Barbara's secrets far earlier than Heller does in her novel. Heller forced her readers to like Barbaraor at least tolerate herbecause she was our guide through the story. But Marber's Barbara is not to be trusted, not to be liked for a single second. We see her as she really is: vengeful, vile, crazy. Still, everyone's a predator in this tale. Sheba feels "entitled" to fuck around with a 15-year-old. Barbara finds a way to one-up Sheba, emotionally blackmailing her until all of themSheba, Barbara, even Steven, that little liarend up a sordid lot deserving of their fates. Just where Marber wants them.
