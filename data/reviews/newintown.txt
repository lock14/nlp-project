What the hell is going on with Ren�e Zellweger? She's always been a polarizing actress, but even longtime fans of her sparkiness and, well, barkiness in films such as Cold Mountain
, Bridget Jones's Diary
, and Doris-Day channeler Down With Love
 can't help but be befuddled by her recent choices (including this month's Golden Globes getup, in which she channeled Day once again, only the latter-era, frosted and feathered kind). Hollywood can be unforgiving, especially about its aging actresses; if Zellweger is going to make a case for her continued relevance in a town that tosses its former sweethearts to the dustbin by age 40, then she'll have to pick smarter projects than New in Town
. It's a fish-out-of-water comedy formerly known as Chilled in Miami
 � one of several interesting facts related in a recent New Yorker
 piece by Tad Friend about movie marketing. The article also poses the age-old question: How do you market a piece of crap? The answer, as ever, is to dress up said crap as something else � in this case, something funny, something sexy, something about the life lessons imparted on a stumbling exec in 4-inch heels (Zellweger) when she arrives in small-town Minnesota to shake up its underproducing factory. It pains me to report that the film � which has a likable enough cast of character actors such as Simmons (Spider-Man
) and Conroy (Six Feet Under
) and a sufficient leading man in the still-easy-on-the-eyes Connick Jr. � wildly underperforms under the trailer's already low-set expectations: It is not particularly funny or sexy, and those life lessons have little to do with the aggressive folk wisdom of the people of New Ulm, Minn., but rather what happens when a total bitch wakes up and realizes there are human costs to corporate dealings. New in Town
 might have better played on the less demanding stage of, say, a Lifetime made-for-TV movie, where Elmer's muzzy direction and a script (by C. Jay Cox and Ken Rance) pockmarked with implausibilities would feel slightly less consequential. Still, forgettable films make it to the big screen all the time; what is more rare is a forgettable film about a character written and portrayed so stridently as to be both an irritant and a bore. That character's name, by the way, is Lucy, a fact only recalled after consulting the studio's press notes. Which is telling and may well be New in Town
's only real distinction: to have the ability to verily disappear before one's eyes.


You've seen "New in Town" before, and you've seen it done better. Still, it's a sweet-hearted bit of anemia, pleasant and obvious, and there are a few honest laughs to it - you could also do worse, especially at this time of the year. There: Have I lowered your expectations enough?
Renee Zellweger, blond and slim and showing off a pair of killer legs, plays Lucy Hill, a corporate mucky-muck from Miami who arrives in the frozen Minnesota hamlet of New Ulm to lay off a bunch of factory workers. If you've seen "Local Hero" or "Northern Exposure," you can start filling in the blanks: The locals will be whimsical and adorable, Lucy will fume amusingly, there'll be a cantankerous-but-attractive member of the opposite sex, the seductions of small-town life will cast their spell.
And that's pretty much how "New in Town" rolls along under Jonas Elmer's bumpy but capable direction. (He's a Danish filmmaker making his Hollywood debut; the studio must have figured he'd know from snow). The most whimsical of the locals is Lucy's secretary, Blanche (Siobhan Fallon Hogan), who makes scrapbooks, talks fluent "Fargo," and is always sayin' the gosh-darn most cutest things. The cantankerous-but-attractive etc. is Ted Mitchell, a union rep played by Harry Connick Jr. with a scrofulous growth of beard that does no one any favors.
"New in Town" takes a while to get started, and the opening scenes are the movie's most groaningly predictable. Once it gets Lucy to New Ulm and past the introductions, though, Elmer and the players ease up. Zellweger gets to uncork a gift for minor slapstick after a sequence in which Lucy, her car stranded during a blizzard, guzzles wine to stay warm. The reliable J.K. Simmons turns up - also under heavy whiskers - as a plant foreman, drolly conspiring against the newcomer. His underplaying neatly balances out Hogan's overplaying.
Meanwhile there's Zellweger, currently one of our more curious movie stars. A while back she was playing a twee Beatrix Potter; last year, in "Appaloosa," she was an Old West schoolmarm who slept around. Now this, and who else would think to have a vacation in mid-winter Minnesota? Zellweger's features are puckering closer to the center of her face as she gets older, but Lucy is one of her happier creations: confident, sexy, secretly a klutz.
Likewise, the movie's got a woodstove for a heart - it takes a while to heat up but eventually it warms the room. You'll probably have come around by the time Lucy takes Ted's teenage daughter (Ferron Guerreiro) to the city for a prom makeover, or the scene where the main characters drop everything and just go crow hunting. (No crows are harmed in this movie, and anyway, that's beside the point.)
The ending? You'll see it coming a mile off across the frozen tundra. If that bothers you, stay home and listen to "Prairie Home Companion." "New in Town" might not get you through February, but it'll get you to next week, and these days we take what we can get.


How much do I want to believe in America 2.0 as a place where a Suit might help factory workers survive hard times? Enough to swallow New In Town , a gentle, traditional (like, from the last century) romantic comedy in which Renée Zellweger  teeters in high heels as a brittle singleton executrix who relocates to a Fargo-adjacent burg and discovers the virtues of  ''square'' Christian values. Bonus discovery: a cute, available man. Harry Connick Jr.  plays Mr. Darcy in a pickup truck.

 In the flat romantic comedy “New  in Town,” Renée Zellweger plays Lucy Hill, a shark in spike heels who wields pretentious corporate jargon like a machete. An aspiring master of the universe who works at the Miami headquarters of a food-processing giant, Lucy is dispatched to an underperforming branch in New Ulm, Minn.,   to oversee slash-and-burn operations. After a few minutes of listening to her running off at the mouth, you may never again want to hear “dialogue” used as a verb.  But the good citizens of New Ulm, including the hunky local union representative, Ted Mitchell (Harry Connick Jr.), will have none of her highfalutin double talk. In the movie, directed by Jonas Elmer from a screenplay by Kenneth Rance and C. Jay Cox, they thaw her frozen heart with tapioca, home baking and handmade valentines. As she warms to Ted, a bearded widower with a 13-year-old daughter, she even loses her contempt for men who drink beer.  The story contains the nub of a workable concept. What could be more pertinent than a yarn in which an arrogant, number-crunching city slicker regains her humanity when faced with decent, hard-working everyday folks in the provinces? But “New In Town” has no idea of  how to play its cards. From their regional accents to their cutesy-poo vocabulary (lots of okey-dokeys), the Minnesotans whom Lucy encounters are ludicrous parodies of the characters in “Fargo.”  You feel as if you are watching creatures more exotic than Snow White’s seven dwarfs.  In particular Lucy’s tapioca-obsessed secretary, Blanche Gunderson (Siobhan Fallon Hogan), acts as though she had been instructed to exponentially multiply the mannerisms of Frances McDormand’s police officer in “Fargo.”  Playing Stu Kopenhafer, the plant manager whom Lucy summarily fires, J. K. Simmons —  outfitted in what appears to be a modified fat suit —  struggles to maintain some dignity.  The calm, all-forgiving Ted, whom  Lucy has repeatedly insulted, comes to her rescue after she swerves into a snowdrift to avoid hitting a cow. During a crow-hunting expedition  she accidentally shoots him in the buttocks, and the next day the smirking workers show up  at the plant wearing targets on their backsides. That’s about as witty as “New  in Town” gets.  Lucy, for her part, brings a little Miami sophistication to New Ulm. She supervises a makeover for Ted’s daughter on the eve of a school dance. Just as the plant is about to be closed, she comes up with an emergency rescue plan that involves Blanche’s secret recipe for tapioca. The movie doesn’t bother to show how the plan is executed in record time.  Watching Ms. Zellweger’s joyless performance, you have to wonder what happened to this formerly charming actress who not so long ago seemed on the verge of becoming a softer, more vulnerable  Shirley MacLaine. As a corporate climber, her edge is all in her clacking heels, not in her bland performance. She is equally unconvincing as a cozy, born-again everyday person with a sense of community responsibility. And where is her most appealing mannerism, her dimpled smile? In a performance that operates as if on automatic pilot, it has faded away.  “New in Town” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language.

Shamelessly formulaic "New in Town" never really recovers from its overbearingly shrill, laugh-free first act. Indeed, even after it stops trying too hard, the pic remains overly familiar and instantly forgettable as a fish-out-of-water laffer about a stressed-for-success femme workaholic who loosens up (and, of course, falls in love) during an extended commingling with small-town rubes. Current dearth of similar fare in the marketplace might help when this Lionsgate release opens as counter-programming during Super Bowl weekend. More likely, though, it will be sacked by critics and shut out as a B.O. contender.
Opening scenes are borderline painful as helmer Jonas Elmer encourages his cast -- led by an unusually strident and unappealing Renee Zellweger -- to underscore and italicize every emotion and motivation of the broadly drawn characters.
Lucy Hill (Zellweger), an ambitious exec for a Miami-based corporation, accepts, with extreme reluctance, an assignment to restructure a failing food-manufacturing plant in the frigid climes of small-town Minnesota (actually Winnipeg, Canada).
Her worst expectations about the isolated place and its rustic populace are quickly realized as she meets Blanche (Siobhan Fallon Hogan), her irrepressibly perky secretary; Stu (J.K. Simmons), the openly insolent and unimpressed-by-outsiders plant foreman; and Ted (Harry Connick Jr.), the hunky union rep for whom she takes an immediate dislike, natch.
It doesn't help that Zellweger, in an unfortunate attempt to make the aud appreciate her character's uptightness, spends many of the early scenes moving about as stiff as a flagpole in January. But it helps even less that Elmer and scripters Kenneth Rance and C. Jay Cox make caricatures of most citizens of the Minnesota burg.
When it comes time for a thaw between Lucy and the townspeople, and we're supposed to warm to the characters as sympathetic individuals, it's difficult to develop a rooting interest.
Moreover, said thaw is announced rather than dramatized, while the pic proceeds as a series of holiday-set episodes -- Thanksgiving, Christmas, Valentine's Day, etc. -- that invite viewers to fill in narrative gaps themselves. Supporting players try to ring easy laughs from thick Minnesotan accents, and "colorful" eccentricities, and Zellweger gamely attempts a series of slapsticky spills and stumbles.
On the plus side, Connick is relatively easy to take, if only because he underplays more often than not. He and Zellweger shine brightest in a few scenes of their characters' seriocomic courtship, suggesting that maybe the thesps had a calming influence on each other.
Production values are mostly adequate, but the pacing is a problem. Because every development in "New in Town" is so predictable, so reminiscent of other, better romantic comedies, it actually seems longer than it is. The final 10 minutes feel unduly protracted, as filmmakers contrive to delay the inevitable happily-ever-aftering with a last-minute complication.
A troubling thought: A weekly TV sitcom spinoff is a distinct possibility.


A corporate tool, but a stylish  corporate tool, single and ambitious Renée Zellweger  is dispatched from sunny Miami to rural Minnesota to close the local factory. She has no personal backstory or identifying characteristics other than her Bettie Page –height boardroom fetish heels. She's Mitt Romney  in a mini, and the business of New in Town  is to soften her MBA-hardened heart. In doing so, we get a standard assortment of sitcom-ready characters: oversharing rube secretary (Siobhan Fallon Hogan ), gruff foreman (J.K. Simmons ), and hunky eligible local bachelor (Harry Connick Jr.) . The effect is like Fargo   without the wood chipper. Economic pain and the downsizing debate soon cede the screen to Zellweger's snowy pratfalls, lutefisk-out-of-water gags, and makeover montages (widowed Connick's got a tween daughter, doncha know). With a cheap, for-hire Danish director (Jonas Elmer ) and a co-writer (C. Jay Cox ) whose major credit is Sweet Home Alabama , the movie wrong-foots Zellweger from the start. She's not enough the ice queen, like Sigourney Weaver  in Working Girl , for us to accept her transition into adorable Melanie Griffith . "I will not get personally attached to this town or anyone in it," says Zellweger. Ultimately, we feel the same way about her.
