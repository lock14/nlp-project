In The Answer Man , Arlen Faber (Jeff Daniels)  isn't any old celebrity author. Twenty years ago, he wrote the mega-best-selling book Me  and God , in which he served up folksy New Age self-help epigrams that convinced a lot of people he had a direct pipeline to the Almighty. And now? He's rich and famous, and also a bitter, disillusioned recluse  a Mitch Albom who turned into J.D. Salinger. Daniels plays Arlen with a kind of cuddly crankiness; he makes him a jerk who just needs a hug. Arlen's salvation plays out with tender cloying predictability, though Lauren Graham, as the chiropractor who falls for him, has more spark than the movie deserves.


 “The Answer Man” is a movie about the softening up of a curmudgeon: a familiar premise and not necessarily a terrible one. Jeff Daniels, playing a reclusive author of inspirational literature, is a fine curmudgeon (see “The Squid and the Whale,” for instance), and Lauren Graham is a perfectly effective curmudgeon softener (see “Bad Santa”). The cast also includes talented younger performers like Lou Taylor Pucci (“Thumbsucker”), Kat Dennings (“Nick and Norah’s Infinite Playlist”) and Olivia Thirlby (“Juno”).  So far so good, though throwing Ms. Dennings and Ms. Thirlby, two up-and-coming indie sweethearts, into a single movie seems a bit redundant. And neither actress has much to do here. But an excess of youthful charm is hardly the main problem with “The Answer Man,” the first feature written and directed by John Hindman.  The main problem is that the movie, in spite of some nice shots of Philadelphia, just doesn’t work. There are a few interesting ideas and potentially engaging characters, but everything slides around like a plateful of half-set Jello, convincing you of nothing beyond Mr. Hindman’s earnest intentions and uncertain skills.  Mr. Daniels plays Arlen Faber, whom we meet 20 years after his book “Me and God” has made him a literary and spiritual sensation. Apparently an extended Q. and A. between its title characters, the book is like “The Da Vinci Code” crossed with “Chicken Soup for the Soul”; it has spawned shelves full of guides and knockoffs and landed its author’s name on nearly every magazine cover in the world.  But not his likeness, since the publicity-shy Arlen has taken refuge from his celebrity in an elegantly appointed row house where he marinates in misanthropy and nurses a bad back. That malady brings Arlen into contact with a neighborhood chiropractor (Ms. Graham), while his urge to rid himself of accumulated volumes of self-help literature leads him to become the reluctant mentor to a bookstore owner (Mr. Pucci) in need of counseling.  Nothing that happens in “The Answer Man” is especially surprising, which would be all right if the movie were less tedious and its characters endowed with more life. As it is, they possess traits, tics and problems, but no real personalities. Arlen in particular is a mess of contradictory behavior — by turns wise, obnoxious, anxious and courtly — that even Mr. Daniels’s well-honed nimbleness cannot bring into coherence.  The film turns on a preposterous dramatic problem. Everyone in the world seems to take the alleged wisdom in Arlen’s book literally and to suppose that the author possesses a direct line to the Almighty. When this turns out — sorry for the spoiler — not to be the case, a new batch of alleged wisdom is offered, this time involving lessons on how humility is better than arrogance, questions are better than answers, and human fallibility is preferable to divine perfection.  But who was arguing? And beyond that, who cares? Neither an effective satire of New Age quackery nor a bittersweet comedy of connection and healing, “The Answer Man” never shows enough passion to be interestingly bad.  “You are here so God can experience the world through your eyes,” Arlen says  at one point, but in the case of this movie, it isn’t enough of a reason.  “The Answer Man” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It  has a lot of profanity.

"Arlen Faber" is the name of the author of a massively successful book on spirituality. It's also the title of this super-slick but gratingly quirky romantic comedy, in which said author -- who, irony of ironies, turns out to be a snarky malcontent -- learns to experience the love of a good woman and admit that he doesn't have all life's answers. Jeff Daniels' gleeful misanthropy and Lauren Graham's emotional openness are poorly served by the pic's transparently phony story and therapeutic uplift; breakout potential looks slight, but John Hindman's writing-directing debut does augur well for a mainstream career.
Spoofing such bestselling spiritual franchises as "The Purpose-Driven Life" and "The Secret," the pic's well-designed opening credits sequence introduces the internationally popular "Me and God," a much-translated, hugely influential account of a "real-life" encounter with God, written by the famously reclusive Arlen Faber. Cue shocked audience laughter as Arlen (Daniels), first seen trying to meditate in his Philadelphia bedroom, lets loose an unholy torrent of profanity when his doorbell rings.
Nearly 20 years after the publication of "Me and God," Arlen has become a first-class curmudgeon, shunning most human contact and refusing to disclose his real identity to anyone. Anyone, that is, except Elizabeth (Graham, "Gilmore Girls"), the winsome chiropractor who realigns his back and sets his cold heart aflutter. For the first time in ages, Arlen has found someone whose company he can stand.
As fate, God or whatever would have it, Elizabeth happens to be an overly protective single mom whose 7-year-old son (Max Antisell) still hasn't accepted that his dad's not coming home. Also in need of a father figure is young Kris (Lou Taylor Pucci), a spiritually directionless bookshop owner who's just emerged from rehab. Alcoholism, apathy, overbearing moms, neglectful dads -- there's no trauma here that can't be milked for a few tears and then dispelled in a one-catharsis-fits-all moment of public confession.
For all the nuggets of sage wisdom it stuffs into Arlen's mouth, Hindman's script shows little interest in actually exploring the mysteries of the human soul, and its fanciful premise -- that millions of readers the world over could be so deeply affected by one book (whose basic content is conveniently never shared with the audience) -- seems naive and unexamined at best, cynical at worst.
Everyone needs healing in "Arlen Faber" -- most of all Arlen . But unlike the monstrously self-absorbed writer Daniels inhabited so trenchantly in "The Squid and the Whale," Arlen is little more than a glib conceit whose transformation is all too easily managed. Pic is so intent on making the character palatable that the actor's biting delivery never cuts very deep.
Nice turns are delivered by Graham, who couldn't seem inauthentic if she tried, and Nora Dunn as Arlen's long-suffering literary agent. Tech credits are of studio quality, right down to a score that offers needless musical punctuation at every turn.
"Arlen Faber" was acquired for theatrical distribution by Magnolia Pictures, which is releasing the film under the title "The Answer Man."

In his quiet way, Jeff Daniels  can coax to vivid life the most cardboard type—which is just as well, given that the rich but reclusive spiritual writer he plays in John Hindman 's pedestrian romantic comedy is not so bad, he's just drawn that way. Daniels's Arlen Faber  is an acerbic loner whose glib pronouncements have made him a conveniently distant guru to the lonely and disaffected. His smug misanthropy is disrupted when a lovely chiropractor and single mom (Gilmore Girls  ' excellent Lauren Graham ) and a hapless young drunk (Lou Taylor Pucci ) enter his life and—blah, blah—bring home to him the power of mutual rescue. Writer-director Hindman is a stand-up comedian with many Turgenev-size issues on his mind—inadequate fathers and troubled sons, overprotective mothers, the search for belief—whose weight this slight picture can hardly bear. But the laid-back charm of Daniels and Graham's bumpy courtship gives the movie a much-needed edge of idiosyncrasy. The lovely and talented Kat Dennings  (Charlie Bartlett , The 40-Year-Old Virgin ) and Olivia Thirlby  (Juno ) go completely to waste in kooky-sidekick roles.
