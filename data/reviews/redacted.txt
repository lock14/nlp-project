 Brian De Palma’s “Redacted,” a prizewinner in Venice and a polarizing selection at film festivals in Telluride, Toronto and New York, is one of a slew of new American movies that try to deal with the war in Iraq and related matters. Their moods and methods vary widely — “Redacted” is furious and confrontational; Robert Redford’s “Lions for Lambs” is pedagogical and talky; Paul Haggis’s “In the Valley of Elah” is mournful and unsettled — but I find myself drawn, in each case, to more or less the same conclusion. I am glad the movie was made, and I wish it were better.  In the case of “Redacted” such ambivalence may seem strange, since the film traffics in, and clearly means to provoke, strong, unbalanced emotions. Its dominant notes are rage, fear and revulsion. Mr. De Palma’s premise, implicit in his choice of title and stated in many interviews and public  pronouncements, is that the truth about Iraq has been edited and obscured, kept away from the American public. Debatable as this claim may be, Mr. De Palma has tried to fill the gaps in our understanding — to bring us face to face with what we have been unable to see or unwilling to acknowledge — with a collage of raw images and angry arguments.  An unrivaled master of showy cinematic technique, he has made a film whose governing conceit is that it is not a film at all but rather a palimpsest of found video culled from consumer-grade camcorders, surveillance cameras, cellphones and Web sites. (There are also snippets from a French documentary, a mischievous parody complete with portentous music and solemn narration.) “Redacted” takes us on a tour not only of the battlefield, but also of the modern media environment, where no moment goes unrecorded and where everyone is, at least potentially, a filmmaker.  Angel Salazar (Izzy Diaz), a soldier in an especially dangerous part of Iraq, dreams of a career in Hollywood and imagines that his video diary will be his ticket to fame. When he isn’t turning the camera on himself, he shoves it in the faces of his comrades in arms and in the process captures their boredom and belligerence. He also reveals them to be figures familiar from just about every platoon picture since the 1940s.  There’s the bespectacled egghead (Kel O’Neill), his nose buried in a book; the square-jawed, earnest Boy Scout type (Rob Devaney);  and a pair of brutes (Daniel Stewart Sherman and Patrick Carroll), whose volatility will spark the film’s central dramatic event.  This horrific, premeditated act — the rape of a teenage girl, who is killed along with her family — is based on a real atrocity that took place in Iraq  last year. (The insurgent bomb and the beheading that frame this episode are also, obviously, grounded in reality.) The rape also recalls “Casualties of War,” Mr. De Palma’s grievously misunderstood 1989 film about a similar incident in Vietnam. Both films walk a delicate line between moral investigation and exploitative sensationalism, and in both cases the measure of Mr. De Palma’s artistic seriousness is his willingness to ask not only what it means to take part in an act of murderous sexual violence, but also what it means to represent it and to watch the representation.  The problem with “Redacted” is that the representation is an unwieldy hodgepodge of brutal naturalism and self-conscious theatricality, its potential power undermined by schematic storytelling and clumsy acting. What those handheld, low-definition recording devices capture is less unvarnished reality — or a persuasive simulacrum of it — than dinner theater or underrehearsed made-for-television drama.  The script stuffs the characters’ mouths with talking points that are no less schematic for being rendered in a profane, macho, pseudomilitary vernacular. And most of the actors, many of them appearing for the first time in a feature film, lack either the skill or the directorial guidance to endow their characters with a full range of credible motives and responses.  Its formal novelty aside, “Redacted” rarely hits the audience with a genuine shock or a clarifying insight. It churns through a set of ideas and emotions that are confusing and unpleasant, to be sure, but also, by now, dispiritingly familiar. This is not entirely Mr. De Palma’s fault, though I think he may have misdiagnosed the condition of the audience, which is not lack of information about Iraq but rather a pervasive moral and political paralysis. The information is out there — confusing and painful, yes, but nonetheless available for discussion and analysis.  And now what? What are we supposed to do? Support the troops? End the war? Push ahead to victory? Stand up for what we believe? These are slogans, not actions.  Making a movie, of course, is a way of doing something, and I am grateful that Mr. De Palma brought such conviction to the task. “Redacted” is certainly a painful document of its time, a record of anguish, confusion and uncertainty. And if Mr. De Palma has in the end failed to transcend those feelings or to address them with the clarity and freshness of perspective that art requires and that the times so desperately demand, the failure is hardly his alone.  “Redacted” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has abundant obscenity and scenes of extreme violence.

The bullet veers far off the mark in Brian De Palma's "Redacted." Deeply felt but dramatically unconvincing "fictional documentary" -- inspired by the March 2006 rape and killings by U.S. troops in Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad -- has almost nothing new to say about the Iraq situation and can't make up its mind about how to package its anger in an alternative cinematic form. HD-lensed item, largely using thesps with legit experience, feels more like a filmed Off Broadway play than a docudrama, and has trouble establishing a consistent dramatic tone. Curio biz looks likeliest for this Magnolia release Stateside.
From its title and intriguing opening (which shows words blacked out on a document by a censor's pen), the film seems determined to explore the repackaging of actual events by official and corporate media. In fact, it does nothing of the kind. From the first sequence, of Latino grunt Angel Salazar (Izzy Diaz) recording his buddies on video camera for a docu ("Tell Me No Lies") he hopes will get him into film school, "Redacted" is much more about the process and techniques of filmmaking than media distortion or coverups.
The breezy Salazar's fellow soldiers in Alfa Company, Camp Carolina, Samarra, fall into the usual stereotypes: bookish Gabe Blix (Kel O'Neill), who spends his time reading John O'Hara's "Appointment in Samarra"; soldier-with-a-conscience McCoy, a lawyer (Rob Devaney); and racist tree-swingers B.B. Rush (Daniel Stewart Sherman) and Reno Flake (Patrick Carroll). Their leader, Master Sgt. James Sweet (Ty Jones), is a motormouth hardass on his third tour of duty.
It's soon clear De Palma intends to construct the whole movie from "found footage" -- Salazar's vid diary, security camera tapes, an Arab TV channel, websites (both U.S. and Islamic fundamentalist) or other docus and testimonials.
After Salazar's opening, the first of these sources to show the outfit going about its daily routine at a checkpoint is a (fake) French docu, "Barrage." Complete with Baroque music, finely shot closeups and a metaphysical commentary -- as different from Salazar's raw, emotional footage as possible -- it's unclear whether De Palma is parodying Gallic documentary style for its artiness or praising it for its detachment. Whichever is true, pic's technique is already starting to deflect attention from any potential message.
Drama finally clicks into gear when a car driven by Iraqis doesn't stop at the checkpoint, and Flake and Rush open fire. Even when it turns out the car contains a pregnant woman rushing to get to a hospital (where she subsequently dies), the two soldiers remain unrepentant. In dialogue that sounds too theatrically scripted, Rush contends, "You can't afford remorse. You get remorse, you get weak; you get weak, you die."Violence escalates when the locals take revenge on one of the group, in a well-staged shock sequence. After a night raid on a private house, seen from the p.o.v. of an embedded journalist, and the subsequent media hoo-ha, Flake and Rush pressure the rest of their group to return on a private mission. Secretly helmet-cammed by Salazar, this ends in the horrific rape of a 15-year-girl and the shooting of her and her family.
Shot in half-shadow amid general hysteria, this sequence does have a raw power, but its impact is diluted by the pic's increasingly wobbly tone and the characters' lack of depth. Dialogue simply checks off issues rather than developing arguments, and there isn't the faintest trace of any moral or ethical complexity visible onscreen.
De Palma the technician and film buff too often gets in the way of De Palma the filmmaker with a cause. And there's little here that he didn't already say in "Casualties of War," with which "Redacted" shares several character and story parallels.
Ironically, pic's most powerful section is its final 10 minutes, as McCoy's traumatic experience is reduced, back home, to a bar yarn that ends with friends cheering him as a hero. De Palma follows that with a photo montage of real-life Iraqi victims of violence, dubbed "Collateral Damage" -- a harrowing couple of minutes that seems, alas, to be a coda to a better picture than "Redacted."
Performances are of a piece with the material, with a slightly overplayed quality that's more suitable to legit than docudrama. Locations in Amman, Jordan, do reasonable service for Iraq. Rest of technical package is high-quality HD level.

Acid flashback or déjà vu? Who, having lived through the late '60s, would have anticipated re-experiencing the spectacle of an arrogantly mendacious U.S. administration bogged down in an ill- conceived, undeclared, bungled, costly, and apparently endless counterinsurgency? (Although who familiar with American history could doubt its recurrence?)
Iraq  isn't Vietnam . Yet, pinned down in the Mesopotamian desert rather than an Indochinese jungle, U.S. technological supremacy is confounded, with atrocious unintended consequences. It's not surprising that Viet-vet PTSD disability-compensation cases have doubled since George W. Bush  declared our mission accomplishedor that, reading about American soldiers who raped a 14-year-old girl and murdered her family, Brian De Palma  would feel compelled to remake his 1989 Viet-nightmare Casualties of War  under the title Redacted .
Powerful, polarizing, and disturbing even in the context of the war's ongoing horror stories, Redacted  was made in Jordan over 18 days for $5 million, and has a credibly sun-blasted look. De Palma, however, operates at once removed: "Welcome to the oven," Baghdad -based Private Angel "Sally" Salazar (Izzy Diaz ) tells the presumed audience for the video journal he's keeping in hopes it will get him into film school. Much of the action is filtered through Sally's camera and tempered by his fatuous Godardian promise of "truth 24 times a second." Everything else is played out on an assortment of blogs, security cams, YouTube rants, Iraqi news reports, and jihadist websites.
De Palma is consistent in this fractured multimedia methodology, as well as in his cinematic jouissance at one point fabricating an arty French doc, replete with symphonic music and Wild Bunch  homage, to show Sally and his unit administering a checkpoint. This "professional" movie enables De Palma to establish that of the 2,000 Iraqi civilians killed at coalition checkpoints, only 60 were ever ID'd as insurgents. (Those French will say anything. . . .)
Redacted  revives Casualties 's sense of men sent on a senseless mission to a country they'll never understand and acknowledges the conditions under which American soldiers live. The paranoia is ultra-Nam, and so is the alienation. The central atrocity is set in motion when the unit's know-it-all sergeant is vaporized by a roadside bomb. But these young Americans are not the fiercely centered warriors of Gregory Burke 's dramatic pageant Black Watch ; they are crude, less-than-sympathetic constructions that De Palma has assembled from blogs, home videos, and embedded documentaries like Gunner Palace . The war is pitched somewhere between reality TV and America's Funniest Home Videos  . Put on the spot by Sally's camera, his comrades reflexively recite official talking points: "We're looking for weapons of mass destruction" cues the central crime. Sally is likable, if amoral; when he's grotesquely punished, his sentimental buddies take over the doc. ("He was our very own Private Ryan," the worst of them muses.)
De Palma is no less a wise guy than he was when he made his Viet-era indies Greetings  or Hi, Mom! , and Redacted  is filled with sophomoric shock humor. An angry questioner at De Palma's New York Film Festival  press conference accused him of making a "hipster horror film." Redacted  is hardly that reductive, but it certainly reflects De Palma's career-long interest in voyeurism and violence, implicating spectator and filmmaker alike. This all figured in Casualties of War , but there's a difference between making a movie about a war that's 15 years over and one happening today.
Opening amid a momentary lull in public antipathy for Bush's war attributable to an otherwise incompetent administration's sensational ability to repress images and control the story Redacted  has been variously attacked as arty, cartoonish, and even overly familiar. One might similarly characterize Fernando Botero 's Abu Ghraib  paintings; earlier this year, Philip Haas 's noir analysis The Situation  was dismissed in comparable terms. But whatever their temperaments, Botero, Haas, and De Palma are fashioning something other than propaganda. Redacted  wasn't made to change your mind, but to unburden De Palma's. Tense, sometimes grating, and emotionally exhausting, the movie ends with a snapshot montage of actual atrocities committed against Iraqi civilians. These bloody images, which De Palma found on the Internet, are set to the stately Handel sarabande that ends Kubrick's Barry Lyndon  , providing an in-your-face coda of the sort used to far stronger effect in Lars von Trier 's hitherto abstract Dogville .
De Palma's distributor Magnolia has redacted these photographs, using black bars to obscure the identity of the dead and brutalized Iraqis. The filmmaker has made no secret of his displeasure, but such censorship only reinforces his point that this war has beenfrom the outsetprofoundly and continuously misrepresented. Indeed, the coda is unnecessary, even a distraction: The movie has already assaulted us by dramatizing the absence of oversight (and De Palma actually undercuts his insistence on the real by staging the final image). The most authentic thing about Redacted  is the rage with which it was made.
