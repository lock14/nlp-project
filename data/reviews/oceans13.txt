Steven Soderbergh's "Ocean's" movies are like silk-screens. A similar caper gets printed on a different casino. In the first movie, a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack vehicle, it was the Bellagio . For this third installment, the extravagantly entertaining "Ocean's Thirteen," it's a gaudy new, Gehry-lite joint down the street. For a "part three," the movie doesn't feel like an overripe work of obligation. I never know I want another one of these until it's here. But that's because they aren't building, in the manner of a saga, toward a showdown with, say, Lord Voldemort . When Danny Ocean and the boys sit around a fountain and stare with satisfaction into the neon Las Vegas night the way they did at the end of the first picture, their lucrative mission (impossible as it was) had been accomplished, it was good, and that's enough. Rinse. Repeat.
This time the repetition is personal. Elliott Gould's Reuben Tishkoff is laid up in the hospital, having keeled over after his business partner shuts him out of their plan to open a Vegas casino. So Danny (George Clooney ) wrangles the gang together to avenge Reuben, his mentor. They will hatch a new job on this ill-got and outlandish-looking establishment and shame the man who owns it. That man is one Willy Bank , the movie's Voldemort . Al Pacino plays the part, and in the early scenes with Gould, he cuts a heartless figure. But Bank is just a calculating businessman with a devastating tan (Pacino's skin is so golden-bronzed here that he finally seems ready to become his Oscar).
What you come to appreciate about Pacino in this movie is how he makes this guy quite human as he runs around making sure everything is ready for opening night. Aside from a few scenes where he acts all over innocent people, the actor is on shockingly good behavior, even as the scope of Danny's operation threatens to make a joke of Bank's latest enterprise. Pacino brings to the movie more of the oldster wisdom that Gould and Carl Reiner , who for this movie dons a comic British accent, have supplied from the start.
The mechanics of the job are predictably and comically ornate, and the night I saw the film I'd left my PhD in ridiculous heist plots at home. So I was free to enjoy the breezy way Clooney and Brad Pitt (virtually a married couple at this point, going for patient walks together and finishing each other's thoughts) set the job in motion, even without understanding what exactly they and the rest of the crew are up to. Don Cheadle , English accent still in hand, hangs out way beneath the casino's bowels . Bernie Mac runs a sham gambling charity. Casey Affleck , wearing a great big moustache, infiltrates the Mexican factory where the casino's dice will be loaded. Eddie Jemison tries to rig the blackjack machines. Shaobo Qin impersonates a Chinese high roller. And Reiner impersonates the man responsible for rating the casino, while the actual reviewer (David Paymer ) is put through a nonstop wringer of humiliating pranks . And Matt Damon , as the most hapless member of this crew, finally gets to spearhead his own very important assignment, while wearing a prosthetic beak of a nose.
He gets to share a tickling couple of scenes with the resurgent Ellen Barkin , who plays Pacino's unflappable number two and whose playful sexiness Hollywood movies have been remiss in ignoring. The scene in which Damon, reeking a pheromone, seduces her is funny and sad since Clooney and Pitt got to use their natural scents to score movie-star foxes in the first two pictures. Regardless, Damon is Jimmy Olsen in a gang of Supermen.
Early in the proceedings, Willy tells an underling, "I don't want the labor pain. I just want the baby." And after a logy start (all that standing around Gould's sickbed, oy), "Ocean's Thirteen" is all baby. Brian Koppelman and David Levien's script is obsessive about details (like the gear necessary for a homemade earthquake) , but the setup pays dividends in the execution. The actual heist, with its wrinkles, hiccups, and trapdoors , is as well-oiled a machine as you'd expect from Steven Soderbergh , who's absolutely at home with the pure commercial dazzle of these movies.
Of course, gourmet flashiness just wouldn't do for a movie like his last, the World War II-era "The Good German ," where the stylistic fun seemed tasteless . He may have to accept that he's more Richard Lester or Stanley Donen than Michael Curtiz , and that there's nothing wrong with that.
The series' frivolity frees him to get away with their air of narcissism, which by the second film had turned noxious with its sequence in which Julia Roberts , as Danny's wife, Tess, is brought in to impersonate Julia Roberts . It was clever but self-congratulatory: Look at how wealthy and famous we are! Yet if these movies are about anything, it's the stages of class. The first film was about striking it rich. The second was about boastfully staying rich, and the third about feeling some guilt over it.
Clooney and Pitt have become off-screen humanitarians, and maybe the bodacious amounts of money nabbed in these capers had come to seem profligate or at least offensive. (Part two was shot near Clooney's Italian villa.) So the new movie is vaguely conscientious. Affleck foments a worker strike down at the dice factory. Clooney gets misty watching one of Oprah Winfrey's life-changing giveaways. And money is donated to charity. It's all very funny. It's unprecedented, too: This might be the first piece of escapism to have a whiff of public service at its heart.


         "Ocean's Thirteen" shows that while you can counterfeit many things in Hollywood, you can't fake inspiration. The latest Steven Soderbergh-directed caper movie starring George Clooney and Brad Pitt is better than the fiasco that was "Ocean's Twelve" (how could it not be?) but not as engaging as "Ocean's Eleven." One of the film's characters sums it up best: "It's not a great idea, but it's an idea."
 
 Even though it was itself a remake of the 1960 film that starred Frank Sinatra and his celebrated pals, Soderbergh's "Ocean's Eleven" was inspired in its own way, a lively, effervescent film that brought a little pleasure into a lot of lives.
 


         






   "Ocean's Thirteen," by contrast, is no more than a reasonable facsimile of that film, the best copy money can buy but a copy nevertheless. Though it's certainly serviceable as the second sequel to a remake, it lacks the brio and elan that made the 2001 film such a treat.
 
  How could it be otherwise? Though Soderbergh and the returning members of his cast, including Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner and Elliott Gould, clearly enjoy working together, these smooth, professional, soulless films have become something of a Hollywood sinecure, a sure source of income requiring little heavy lifting.
 
  Perhaps because the self-satisfied "Ocean's Twelve" was so unfocused, the "Thirteen" script, written by Brian Koppelman and  David Levien ("Rounders") has gone back to basics. The new film is thankfully straight-ahead, a nuts-and-bolts effort that returns Ocean's gang to its "let's rob a casino in Las Vegas
" roots.
 
 Though Andy Garcia's malevolent casino owner Terry Benedict is back from both previous "Ocean's," the targets this time are Willy Bank (Al Pacino channeling Phil Spector) and his no-nonsense associate Abigail Sponder (an underutilized Ellen Barkin), the principals in a brand-new casino called, yes, the Bank.
 
 The Bank was supposed to be a partnership between Mr. Bank and Reuben "I used to mean something in this town" Tishkoff (Gould). But Bank turns on his erstwhile partner and Ocean associate, sending Tishkoff to the hospital with a massive coronary.
 
 Enter Ocean himself (Clooney), Rusty Ryan (Pitt) and the rest of the players. They figure that an attempt to break the Bank will give Tishkoff a reason to live and exact the proper measure of revenge twice over. For the gang not only wants to take Bank's money, they want to undermine his determination to get the coveted Royal Review Board Five Diamond Award (given in the real world by the American Automobile Assn.) for his new hotel.
 
 Much of "Ocean's Thirteen" is taken up with the complex planning necessary for these elaborate scams. This is entertaining up to a point, but sometimes it seems that the entire movie is an elaborate sleight-of-hand maneuver, a series of manufactured crises designed to divert us from how little is actually going on.
 
 Also problematic is the nature of the film's foible-filled characters. When they were introduced in the first film, the tics and neuroses of the gang members were amusing, but seeing things like the insecurity of Damon's Linus Caldwell and the bickering of the Malloy brothers (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan) repeated again and again soon loses its appeal.
 
 Also a difficulty is the smugness that is one of the defining characteristics of Ocean's team. These guys are awfully stuck on themselves, and though they have reason to be content, it is hard to completely share in their happiness. "Ocean's Thirteen" will please those who delight in its persistent self-mythologizing, but the thrill of the original is gone, and nothing can bring it back.
 
 
 "Oceans Thirteen," MPAA rating: PG-13, for brief sensuality. Running time: 1 hour, 56 minutes. In general release.   

They're ''analog players in a digital world.'' That's how one cynical wag sums up Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and his team of misfit logistical wizards in Ocean's Thirteen , Steven Soderbergh's delectably elaborate and savory soufflé of a mother-of-all-scams sequel. Danny and his boys are being told that they're out of touch, not up to matching wits with a 21st-century casino wired with technology smarter than they are. Of course, the put-down is really a compliment. What makes Danny and his gang so winning, apart from their hip button-lipped swagger, is their oldfangled ingenuity  their eagerness to spring any trick, from weighted roulette balls to a fake earthquake.
In Ocean's Thirteen , the cons and gambits come at you thick and fast, and Clooney and his compatriots guide them all with such insular verbal code (quick, what's a Billy Martin?) that the movie is beyond sly  it's a blizzard of blissed-out chicanery. There are enough interlocking ruses to fill a dozen heist thrillers, and a few leftover James Bond films besides. Here, however, as in Ocean's Eleven  (though not in the overly-pleased-with-itself Ocean's Twelve ), the polarities of complication and ease of execution are neatly reversed: The more impossible the trick, the more that Danny and his boys bring it off with a casual, no-sweat, who cares?  insouciance. It's grace under pressure turned into unfettered masculine style.
In the witty script by Brian Koppelman and David Levien (Rounders ), the heist, more than ever, is just a MacGuffin, with Danny and his team out to take revenge on Willy Bank (Al Pacino, just about glowing with depraved capitalist good cheer), a casino magnate who has strong-armed the benevolent Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) out of co-ownership of his new Las Vegas gaming palace. The casino itself is a gaudy tower of sin: a three-stranded ribbon of candied metal twirling up into the sky. As Willy prepares for opening night, Danny readies his plan, which is to squash Willy's chance for a coveted Five Diamond rating, and also to slice off his profits, in which case the co-ownership reverts back to Reuben. To do that, Danny must ensure that the house keeps losing.
There's a scam in every corner. How do you fake a lie-detector test to get the shrimpy electronics ace Livingston Dell (Eddie Jemison) certified as a shuffle-machine technician? Why, you put a tack in his shoe, so he can step on it when he's giving a true answer, thus spiking the bodily-discomfort waves to match his false replies. How do you sneak weighted dice into a casino that's guarded like Dick Cheney's bunker? Easy: You send Virgil and Turk Malloy (Casey Affleck and Scott Caan) down to a dice factory in Mexico, so they can slip magnetic powder into the hot liquid dice mix. And what about that bogus earthquake? Nothing to it: Have Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) operate a tunnel drill that will rock the casino to its foundations, even if buying that drill requires $36 million  and, therefore, the partnership of an old nemesis. I haven't even mentioned the Vegas-from-hell holiday orchestrated to torment a professional hotel-casino critic (David Paymer); Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) disguising himself as a hippie seismologist to plant a hidden camera; or Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) seducing Pacino's right-hand woman, Abigail Sponder (Ellen Barkin), by wearing aphrodisiac cologne  and, for no good reason, a false nose that gives him the exact profile of...Steven Soderbergh. (Okay, they're allowed one decadent inside joke.)
In the Ocean's  films, the sheer complexity of the engineering is a delight, and also an ornate riff on what 'the workplace'' has become. Ocean's Eleven  winked at the armor of male camaraderie, with the heist used as a deadpan illustration of how men, out of the fear that they might end up looking a little too, you know, friendly , now bond exclusively through mutual tasks. Ocean's Twelve  just winked at itself, but Ocean's Thirteen  returns to the first film's frictionless comedy of attitude. The movie is a witty celebration of process , using Danny's casino scam to make a comment on the world he's out to defeat  the world of technology, of systems, that now rules us all. To undermine the casino and, in particular, its sci-fi surveillance computer (which can read the pupil dilations of every gambler), Danny and his team must use their analog skill to beat the digital world at its own game. They may be 'doing it for Reuben,'' but the movie employs a handful of throwaway gags (Danny tearing up at Oprah , Virgil and Turk fomenting a Mexican workers' strike) to ask: In a world ruled by process, is compassion still real? Or is it just another scam? In Ocean's Thirteen , it is deviously, and merrily, both.

 Ah, bliss, the gang’s all here, well, the guys anyway, looking fighting trim and Hollywood beautiful, at your disposable pleasure as well as mine. There’s George, of course, as in Mr. Clooney, lovely and lean and a touch more gray, smiling and gliding his way through the shimmer and gleam. Brad, henceforth known as Pitt the Elder,  looks a wee tired around the eyes, like a baby-bottle warmer on 3 a.m. call, while Matt Damon looks handsomer, somehow more adult, now that he has a lucrative action franchise to call his own.  The third time really is a charm.  “Ocean’s 23,” oops, “Ocean’s Thirteen,” is also  a gas; it’s lighter than air, prettier  than life, a romp, a goof and an attentively oiled machine. Our master of ceremonies, Steven Soderbergh, having come down the mountain of his own grandiose ambitions (more on that later), is working it hard here and working it very well. The screenplay,  from the new team members Brian Koppelman and David Levien, moves fast and makes you laugh, partly because the elaborate plot often makes no seeming sense. But sense can be awfully overrated at times, particularly with an enterprise like this, which pushes at the limits of conventional narrative filmmaking, forcing your attention away from the story’s logical bricks and mortar toward its fields of dancing colors and a style that is its content.  This third time around, Mr. Clooney’s Danny Ocean has returned to Las Vegas to bail out his old buddy and former mentor Reuben (Elliott Gould as the spirit of 1970s cinema idiosyncrasy), who has recently been taken for a pricey ride down chump avenue by a Vegas villain named, nicely, nicely, Runyon-style, Willy Bank. Played by a tamped-down, amused and amusing Al Pacino, Willy Bank is a pint-size Trump in oversize eyeglasses and a burnt-orange tan that makes him look like an Hermès handbag, especially when he’s keeping company with his second-in-command, Abigail Sponder (Ellen Barkin, ropy, ripe and oh-so-ready). Mr. Pacino and Ms. Barkin, who once steamed up the screen together in the 1989 thriller “Sea of Love,” sweeten the pot without making it boil.  But that’s how everything rolls in Mr. Soderbergh’s Vegas: smoothly and sleekly and low to the ground, without obvious effort and, most important, without ugliness. America’s playground has never looked more glamorous and seductive than it does in the first and most recent “Ocean’s”; it’s no wonder the casinos play along with whatever nonsense Mr. Soderbergh puts into gear, whether it’s a blackout (as in the first film) or an absurdly contrived  disaster (the third). When Danny Ocean and his Boy Friday, Rusty Ryan (Mr. Pitt), stroll across a casino floor, you never see the cigarette burns on the carpeting or the middle-aged men quietly weeping after the night and their savings are long gone. When they’re in town,  the promise of Vegas burns as bright as the city’s gaudy lights.  That promise may be a lie, but because all three “Ocean’s” are also self-consciously about the smoke and mirrors and glamour of movies — their elaborate cons can sound a lot like film-financing schemes — it is the kind of lie that nurtures and sustains. These movies bewitch precisely because they exist outside the prison house of realism that Mr. Soderbergh sometimes seems overly anxious to lock himself — and his audiences — into, as witness  his unfortunately punishing last effort, “The Good German.” In the “Ocean’s” trilogy, you enter an enchanted realm where Mr. Clooney and Mr. Pitt are the world’s loveliest, luckiest hucksters and sparring partners, heirs to Paul Newman and Robert Redford in “The Sting,” as well as to Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell in “His Girl Friday.”  You also enter a world of visual enchantments. Working under the name Peter Andrews,  Mr. Soderbergh again shows what an exceptional cinematographer he can be,  whether shooting on celluloid or in video, with a particular sensitivity to the narrative and graphical uses of color. Many  of the casino scenes in this “Ocean’s” look as softly burnished as  gold ingots, as if they had been dipped in a 24-karat finishing bath. Perhaps in homage to the mid-1960s Jean-Luc Godard or just because the results look so extraordinary, Mr. Soderbergh occasionally saturates the image with an iridescent red that makes everything inside the frame look as if it were gently vibrating. At other times, he floods the image with a piercing blue that summons up twilight on the Côte d’Azur.  We are a long way from sundown on the Strip and much of contemporary Hollywood too, and so much the better. One of the most creatively restless filmmakers working  the studio system today, Mr. Soderbergh has for a number of years divided his time and energy between expensive,  star-studded productions like the “Ocean’s” films and smaller projects like “Bubble” (shot in high-definition digital without professional actors). With any other director,  the tendency would be to classify the smaller, cheaper films as personal and the bigger, costlier ventures as strictly professional, pounds of flesh that an artist like Mr. Soderbergh must forfeit for experiments (and box office flops) like “The Good German” and his touching, unloved remake of Andrei Tarkovsky’s “Solaris.”  Yet to watch Mr. Clooney, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Damon in the “Ocean’s” films, along with those other merry men — Don Cheadle, Andy Garcia, Bernie Mac, Carl Reiner, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Eddie Jemison and Shaobo Qin — is to realize that it’s a mistake to separate Mr. Soderbergh’s personal visions from his professional commitments. All the films are strictly personal;  it is just that some, like “The Good German,” have been made more for Mr. Soderbergh’s pleasure than for ours. Part of what makes the “Ocean’s” films, even the self-indulgent second installment, so enjoyable is that they’re not only about Mr. Soderbergh’s obsessive aesthetic investment in every single shot, but they’re also about him trying to make the audience love his images every bit as much as he does.  This isn’t about compromise; it’s about locating that sweet spot between the work of art and the audience, and turning a private reverie into a public expression. One of the truths about Mr. Soderbergh is that while his heart and head seem to lean toward more rarefied film practices, evidenced by his (improved) remake of an art-house heavyweight  like “Solaris” and his aggressively anti-aesthetic exercise like “Bubble,” he has over the years also mastered classic Hollywood techniques brilliantly. Playing  inside the box and out, he has learned to go against the grain while also going with the flow. In “Ocean’s Thirteen” he proves that in spades by using color like Kandinsky and hanging a funny mustache on Mr. Clooney’s luscious mug, having become a genius of the system he so often resists.  “Ocean’s Thirteen” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Gambling looks mighty fun in this film, as does larceny.

As smooth as a good mojito, as stylish as an Armani suit and as meaningful in the grand scheme of things as yesterday's Las Vegas betting odds, "Ocean's Thirteen" continues the breezy good times of the first two series entries without missing a beat. By returning the action to Vegas, producer Jerry Weintraub and director Steven Soderbergh recapture the feel of the 2001 original after the  2004 European detour that bugged some fans. With George, Brad, Matt and the rest pulling another ultra-cool con without breaking a sweat, and with Al Pacino ideal as their new nemesis, Warner Bros. can bet on cashing in for yet another franchise payday.
Script by Brian Koppelman and David Levien, who penned the sharp gambling-world drama "Rounders," puts all its dramatic chips on the anticipated comeuppance of a thoroughly reprehensible baddie. Egomaniacal Vegas kingpin Willy Bank (Pacino) has screwed the beloved Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould) out of his part ownership in Bank's latest venture, the Strip's most grandiose and luxurious hotel-casino. Bank's unscrupulous reputation preceded him, but Reuben made the mistake of trusting him since they are among the few pioneers left old enough to have shaken Sinatra's hand. 
With Reuben in critical condition from shock, Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) gather the clan together again to avenge their mentor. The Bank, as the new pleasure palace is known, is to bow July 3, and the men swiftly concoct a fantastically complicated high-tech scheme to sabotage the opening, divest Bank of his riches, ruin his reputation and restore Reuben to health and wealth in one fell swoop.
No problem for these guys, except that Bank's empire, and the systems that are in place to secure it, appear to be impregnable. Much of the fun, then, stems from the dizzying ways in which Ocean's team surmounts the difficulties: Dice is magnetized in Mexico, card shufflers and slot machines are rigged, a camera is snuck into Bank's office, would-be high-rollers are brought in and pulled out. Most audaciously, an earthquake is artificially stimulated under the Bank (using a giant drill formerly used to carve out the Chunnel -- specifically, the one that started on the French side), forcing the evacuation of the casino at a crucial moment.
On top of all this, when Ocean runs low on funds, he's forced to turn to Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia), his adversary in the first film, for further financing, which is forthcoming on one condition--that Ocean steal the diamonds Bank has hidden away in an unreachable place in his building. A problem but, again, no problem.
So much for the high stakes. What seems to obsess Bank most is the Five Diamond Award, a top hotel ranking he's achieved at all his other establishments worldwide. Pic's most amusing subplot involves Carl Reiner's Sal Bloom posing as an evaluator assessing the Bank during its soft opening run while the real ratings man, played by David Paymer in ultra-schleppy victim mode, is beset by all manner of ill-treatment by hotel staff, real and otherwise.
Last but not least, Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) turns up as the ultra-efficient (and fake schnozzed) Man Friday to would-be high-roller Mr. Weng (Shaobo Qin) in order to romantically distract Bank's sharp-eyed No. 2 (Ellen Barkin) during the opening festivities.
Most of the action plays out at the imposing Bank hotel, a faintly absurd but nonetheless amazing twisting structure that dominates the Vegas skyline thanks to impeccable CGI work and impresses via the interiors conjured by production designer Philip Messina. Unlike "Ocean's Eleven,"  which locationed in a genuine casino, new film was shot on a lavish set built on Warner Bros.' biggest soundstage. The main room is a double-level, balconied affair with an Asian motif. Decor is dominated by sumptuous golds and reds, with money dripping from every frame as Soderbergh, under his nom de camera 

Peter Andrews, shoots this one more steadily and glamorously than he did the first entry.
As before, most of the scenes are deliberately underplayed banter sessions dominated by quick give-and-take, knowing exchanges and sly understatement among a members-only troupe. Everyone looks their best and knows they can never be one-upped, as befits some of Hollywood's biggest stars brandishing a we-know-we-have-it-and-you-don't unflappable cool that stops short of the arrogance some detected in "Ocean's Twelve."
Only moments of something remotely resembling reflection and emotion are delivered in pic's most appealing scene, in which Danny and Rusty, either toward dawn or dusk, walk along a street deliberately framed to accentuate trees and an elegant, Euro-style backdrop and discuss Reuben and the Vegas they used to know before everything changed.
Cast, fab production values and a pace that never flags keep the fizz on the series. Another entry is indicated by the final dialogue exchanges. Taking his leave, Damon tells Clooney and Pitt, "See you when I see you." Pitt then bids adieu to Clooney with own little in-jokes, "Hey! Next time! Keep the weight off. Have a couple of kids." 


Lowest Common Denominatorism writ large and engraved in stone like the Ten Commandments according to Cecil B. DeMille , the Hollywood  blockbuster is often an allegory for itself. Walt Disney , the notoriously litigious studio that successfully changed the nation's copyright laws to protect its trademark Mickey Mouse  but more recently declared, "We understand now that piracy is a business model," grosses over $400 million with the third edition of a movie celebrating the lifestyles of the weird and buccaneerish.
Pirates of the Caribbean  effectively glamorizes piracy. Similarly, Ocean's Thirteen , Steven Soderbergh  and George Clooney 's latest remake of Frank Sinatra 's rat pack Vegas caper, the essence of curdled ring-a-ding-ding, is the surest bet in showbiz. It's a spectacle blatantly predicated on a smug gaggle of mega movie stars in boss threads ostentatiously having fun by pretending to steal the house's money, while actually taking yours. See it if you must, but don't forget to pack the Air Wick . These breezy doings are mustier than a Glitter Gulch  casino at 4 a.m.
The party opens with Rusty Ryan  (Brad Pitt ) summoned to meet Danny Ocean  (Clooney) on a private plane to Vegas. It's an emergency mission of mercy. The gang's guru-cum-mascot Reuben Tishkoff (Elliott Gould ) is in the hospital recovering from a coronary precipitated by the double-dealing treachery of his erstwhile partner, another venerable Vegas operator with the colorful moniker Willie Bank  (Al Pacino ). How could the hand that once "shook Sinatra's" backstab a fellow pioneer like Reuben, so old school they named a deli sandwich after him?
The scene uniting onetime maniacs Gould and Pacino is not without its autumnal poignancyCalifornia Split  on a Dog Day Afternoon . Not so, the Ocean's Thirteen  premise. The plan is to avenge Reuben by preventing Willie's new super-duper deluxe hotel, the Bank, from getting a Five-Diamond rating while rigging the slots, dice, cards, and roulette wheels to drive the establishment into bankruptcy on opening night. It's kind of a benefit, and reprising his antagonistic role as the victim of Ocean's Eleven  and nemesis of Ocean's Twelve , Andy Garcia  drops in to provide the necessary financing.
Garcia's greedhead aside, the Thir- teenwho include, as usual, Matt Damon , Don Cheadle , Bernie Mac , Casey Affleck , Shaobo Qin , and as the senior shtick artist, Carl Reiner are closer at heart to the Justice League of America than to Sinatra's larcenous band of brothers (even if, to paraphrase Variety  on Ocean's Twelve  , it's a case of the rich stealing from the richer to give to the richest). There's even a hint of social criticism:Buying off a factory of Mexican workers is the cheapest part of the operation.
Clooney's Ocean is less the military leader Sinatra pretended to be, than the movie's genial host. Slumming in the role of sidekick number one, Pitt, who only has a handful of lines, mainly stands around with his arms folded. Given that Ocean has evidently re-divorced or otherwise contractually forgotten the character played in the previous movies by Julia Roberts , Ellen Barkin  is the lone woman on screen (save for a couple of televised Oprah  cameos). She exists largely as the butt of Damon's seduction.
Working against the underdevel- oped notion of a security system outfitted with artificial intelligence, the Oceaneers engineer a monumental opening night disaster, complete with faux earth- quake. The logistics of this scheme are often tediouspredicated as they are on the substitution of bonhomie for suspenseand the movie ends perfunctorily with Sinatra warbling, "This town is a lonely town." His subject may be Vegas but the sentimental denunciation of a "use-you, abuse-you until you're down town" is surely meant to mock Holly- wood: "It's a miserable town . . . a nowhere town . . . You better believe that I'm leavin' this town."
Sure you are. Good night and good luck. Ostensibly, Ocean's Thirteen  is that which enables Soderbergh and Clooney to make their personal projects and, as such, it's not without a splash of ironic self-awareness. "You don't run the same gag twiceyou run the next gag," Ocean, straight-faced, explains to his cohorts.
Basically, Ocean's Thirteen  is a meta-caperunderlying all the riffs is the identification of conning with acting. The real question is: How many times can Soderbergh and Clooney pull off this same stunt?
