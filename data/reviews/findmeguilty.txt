Giacomo DiNorscio was the flashiest member of New Jersey's Lucchese crime family, which was charged with 76 counts of breaking the law. Of the 20 accused mobsters, he alone actually chose to defend himself in court.
A comedy with patches of drama, Sidney Lumet's "Find Me Guilty" watches DiNorscio blunder his way through the legal process, practicing in the courtroom what he's studying in his prison cell.
Lots of actors could have played DiNorscio, nicknamed "Fat Jack" or "Jackie Dee," with an unlikely blend of self-mockery and hubris, goofiness and gravitas. But one can only assume they were busy shooting the current season of "The Sopranos."
Instead, the job falls to Vin Diesel. And the best I can say about his performance is that it's charmingly terrible. He wears a John Gotti wig, his hands slice and sail through the air when he talks, and that bottomless, rumbling, eternally smoky voice is sometimes inflected with glee.
Any actor can get a laugh merely by asking the judge, "May I have a sidebar?" But Diesel asks in a way that's hilarious and kind of heartbreaking. Neither he nor the character has any idea what he's doing.
When intimidation is called for, Diesel seems petulant. When he's required to be sexual, he looks childish and sleepy. Elsewhere, he looks lost, exposed, and, on a few occasions, freaked out by the impossible burden the film puts on him: to turn ground turkey into a Butterball.
But what can he do to pick up the movie's pace? Starting in 1987, the Lucchese trial crawled on for a historic 21 months, and the movie feels like it lasts twice that long. Lumet is kind enough to tell us how many days have passed (334, 521, etc.) and forces us to spend time with the prosecuting attorneys, led by the usually fine English actor Linus Roache, who rarely turns down an opportunity here to seethe or blow up.
Roache's character is meant to be our window onto the trial's absurdity; its length and ludicrousness are giving him a nervous breakdown. But Roache has mistaken "Find Me Guilty" for a farce it doesn't have the energy or sharpness to be.
Lumet is a long way from his 1982 courtroom triumph, "The Verdict." But he's even far from the occasional pleasures of his previous picture about hoods, 1989's so-so "Family Business."
No director in Hollywood has had as thorough or keen an interest in American urban decay, from "The Pawnbroker" and "Serpico" to "The Wiz," "Prince of the City," and "Q&A." Lumet's career has been long and amazingly diverse, but the New York metropolitan area, its cops, thugs, courts, and ghettos, have been a uniting thread. With "Find Me Guilty," Lumet is clearly going for the tricky balance of satire and social outrage that he perfected in "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Network." But at 81, the director just isn't as nimble or as mad as he used to be.
Scenes in "Find Me Guilty" just trickle by, and all the action on the witness stand seems to run together. Ron Silver sedately plays the judge, and he's picked the wrong occasion to stop overacting. (He might bring too much order to the court.)
Because the film, written by T.J. Mancini and Robert McCrea, seems so overstaffed and undercooked, it's often hard to know who's who and what precisely is happening. Every day, all 20 defendants appear in the courtroom at the same time, along with their lawyers, family members, and whoever else wants to be an extra. With this many tacky people sitting so lethargically around so many tables, the courtroom shots seem like velour paintings of "The Last Supper" stagnating at a yard sale.
Every once in a while, something funny will happen. Every day, one elderly defendant has to be wheeled into the courtroom on a hospital bed. At one point, during the trial, the poor guy dozes off and rolls from the mattress onto the floor. Anybody struggling to stay with this movie will know the feeling.

The galvanizing return of The Sopranos , with the series' authoritative grasp of ethics and consequence, doesn't do any favors for Find Me Guilty , a sharp-looking Mob drama with a gooey moral center. Based on the real-life testimony of Giacomo ''Jackie Dee'' DiNorscio, a member of New Jersey's Lucchese crime family facing a 30-year sentence, the movie is a shorthand version of what became the longest criminal trial in U.S. history: For 21 months during 1987–88, 20 Lucchese associates were tried on 76 different charges. Each wiseguy had his own defense attorney  all except DiNorscio, who represented himself.
As Vin Diesel plays him in a likable, image-adjusting turn  prosthetically fat, thick of Jersey accent  Jackie (who died in 2004) was about as sweet as a career criminal can be; he was also a showman, a comedian, a doozy. And the fact that he refused to rat on his family is admired  with irksomely naive neutrality  as its own form of nobility.
Never mind that Find Me Guilty  is directed by that great, 81-year-old chronicler of urban law and disorder, Sidney Lumet. Diesel's DiNorscio is styled as an untouchably charismatic mook in the softy script by T.J. Mancini and Robert McCrea, which can't decide whether to smile or laugh outright at the government's efforts to break the power of organized crime. As a result, the rest of the players  a great clutch of guys, including Peter Dinklage as a precise and persuasive lawyer, Linus Roache as an obsessed federal prosecutor, and Ron Silver as the judge  are never granted a fair day in court.

   "I'm no gangster, I'm a gagster," crows Giacomo (Jackie Dee) DiNorscio, the goombah antihero of Sidney Lumet's gripping courtroom drama "Find Me Guilty."  Wearing a reddish-brown wig, his gut protruding over his belt loops, a goofy leer spreading across his mug, Vin Diesel's Jackie could be the cutup baby brother of Tony Soprano. The role of a wisecracking wise guy  embellishes Mr. Diesel's menacing force field with stand-up comedy and macho sentimentality. At last he plays a real character instead of a swaggering cartoon of testosterone on the rampage.  "Find Me Guilty" resurrects a notorious 1987-88 court case in which 20 men said to be members of the New Jersey-based Lucchese crime family were prosecuted by the federal government on more than 75 criminal counts involving the usual assortment of mob activities. After dragging on for nearly two years, the trial ended with a shocking  outcome.  Jackie alone  insisted on representing himself. While driving both the judge (Ron Silver) and the mob kingpin Nick Calabrese (Alex Rocco) into paroxysms of rage and anxiety, Jackie, whose real-life nickname was Fat Jack, clowned and charmed his way into the hearts of the jury like an uncensored late-night talk show host. Mr. Diesel also succeeds in making a dangerous thug almost lovable with his sensational performance.  Video: Movie Minutes Stephen Holden reviews the courtroom drama "Find Me Guilty," Sidney Lumet's first feature film in seven years.  Mocking conventional courtroom decorum, Jackie portrays himself as a free spirit, brazenly and fearlessly cutting through the official rigmarole to tell it like it is in profane street language spiced with dirty jokes. Face to face with a witness who is a former associate, he accuses him in the most graphic terms of having always lusted after him. Another witness is ridiculed for not knowing the difference between a Lincoln and a Cadillac. Such details skillfully puncture the prosecution's pose of infallibility.  Jackie also skewers  the prosecution's careless ethnic profiling. When a federal agent recalls his surveillance of a room of Italians, Jackie jokingly baits him to describe exactly how he was sure they were Italian.  At the time the indictments are handed down, Jackie is already serving a 30-year sentence for an earlier crime. Offered a reduction in jail time in exchange for becoming a prosecution witness, he bluntly refuses. His insistence that he would never rat out a colleague, even one who had betrayed him, gives him the moral advantage when confronting the feds' star witness, his cousin Tony Compagna (Raúl Esparza). We meet this nervous, drugged-up underling in the movie's opening scene,  when Tony bursts into Jackie's home, dashes upstairs and shoots him several times, failing to kill him. Facing his cousin in court, Jackie expresses only a magnanimous pity for a sick family member, and the witness, humiliated and guilt-stricken, withers before our eyes.  "Find Me Guilty," Mr. Lumet's first feature film in seven years, catches him near the top of his game. Now 81, this master surveyor of the urban jungle still has the machinery of police work and courtroom ritual down cold. His skill at conveying the feel of federal offices, jail cells and the eateries where cops and criminals gather to shoot the breeze is so precise you can almost smell the paint on the walls and the food in the kitchen. Where it can, the screenplay he wrote with T. J. Mancini and Robert J. McCrea uses dialogue taken from court transcripts.  Thanks to "The Godfather," "GoodFellas," "The Sopranos" and their countless imitations, the characters in contemporary mob dramas are now such beloved clichés that they are almost like family. Or rather, they are cherished fantasy projections of ourselves in a shadow version of a society obsessed with family values and corporate upward mobility.  With its herd of 20 defendants and nearly as many lawyers, "Find Me Guilty" suggests a panoramic episode of "The Sopranos," with a little casting overlap. The most incendiary cameo belongs to Annabella Sciorra (who played Tony Soprano's suicidal girlfriend, Gloria) as Bella, Jackie's bitter ex-wife. It is only one of many excellent supporting performances. Mr. Silver, directing his eyes like drills into a mudflat, personifies cold judicial imperiousness. Peter Dinklage's chief defense attorney projects a more gentlemanly and well-spoken but equally ferocious gravitas. Linus Roache's smug chief prosecutor slowly and subtly begins losing his cool as Jackie's outrageous courtroom antics captivate the jury.  Looked at in a different way, "Find Me Guilty" could be taken as a serious comedy about the baleful impact of television on the criminal justice system, as the next step to media madness after Mr. Lumet's film "Network." Because the events in the movie preceded the Menendez  brothers and O. J. Simpson murder trials and the debuts of Court TV and "Law & Order," the film offers a tasty prelude to the era when crime and punishment expanded from part-time television entertainment into a fulltime spectator sport that merged fiction and reality.  In other words, Jackie Dee was a reality-star-in-waiting  while the demonic recipe for a mediathon immersion was still being perfected.  "Find Me Guilty" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).  It has abundant profanity and scenes of intense violence.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

Sidney Lumet continues his remarkable six-decade run of New York-set dramas and Vin Diesel returns from the action-film gulag to give a shambling comic turn as the real-life mobster who hijacked a huge trial in the goombah comedy-drama "Find Me Guilty." Emphasizing the comic aspects of tale will help pull thesp's "Pacifier" fans, though dicey prosthetics and wig work may alienate those who prefer him buff 'n' bald. Verdict here for mid-March opening is moderate to good biz, with strong cultish ancillary possible.
In 1987-88, some 20 members of the Lucchese crime family, each with his own lawyer, were brought to trial on some 76 charges ranging from criminal conspiracy to narcotics trafficking. The jam-packed trial dragged on for 21 months, and the shocking verdict is the stuff of legal legend.
Earlier, after being pumped full of lead by his strung-out cousin Tony Compagna (Raul Esparza), Lucchese crime figure Giacomo "Jackie Dee" DiNorscio (Diesel) is jailed on charges based on the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act.
Thinking he can co-opt the mobster to roll over on his family during the massive proceedings, comically hard-charging prosecutor Sean Kierney (Linus Roache) offers a reduction in DiNorscio's 30-year sentence in return for his testimony. Jackie Dee refuses.
As the trial gets under way, the mobster decides to represent himself, against the advice of by-the-book lead defense attorney Ben Klandis (Peter Dinklage). What follows are extended comic riffs to the jury by DiNorscio, apparently drawn from trial transcripts, that put him at odds both with long-suffering Judge Finestein (Ron Silver) and vicious crime boss co-defendant Nick Calabrese (Alex Rocco).
Part mob-trial thriller, part "dese 'n' dose" extended standup routine, character-rich pic plays like vintage Lumet, mining the grim comedy from life-and-death legal wranglings in the manner of "Dog Day Afternoon," "Prince of the City" and "The Verdict."
And if Diesel's perf as a real-life wisecracking wise guy isn't quite at the iconic level of Al Pacino, Treat Williams or Paul Newman, neither is it as determinedly one-dimensional as his action hero persona.
Genuinely committed to the mob family, DiNorscio is imbued by Diesel with genuine emotional ambivalence: Perhaps, as Calabrese thinks, he's an opportunist looking to save his own skin. But maybe, as Jackie Dee keeps saying, family is everything.
Principal supporting cast is aces. Roache manages to make the cartoonish Kierney a legitimate force, and the straight-faced readings of Dinklage, Silver and crime film vet Rocco ground the pic in gravitas. Annabella Sciorra gives a master class on tough-gal posturing in her single memorable scene as DiNorscio's tough-as-nails ex-wife. Huge supporting cast is stocked with primo New York theater talent, as well as faces familiar to anyone who watches crime shows on the tube.
Other than Diesel's spotty makeup and dubious wig, tech credits are tops. Audaciously framed closeups from d.p. Ron Fortunato hark back to Lumet's days in live television, while wider panning shots of production designer Christopher Nowak's elegantly threadbare courtroom, jammed to the rafters with goodfellas, are funny in and of themselves. Jaunty score comprises extended riff on Louis Prima's version of the 1928 chestnut "When You're Smiling (the Whole World Smiles With You)."

It's startling to think that Sidney Lumet  has brought courtrooms to cinemas for nearly 50 years, from 12 Angry Men  (1957) to The Verdict  (1982) to Night Falls on Manhattan  (1997). But Find Me Guilty  is his first legal picture to shoot for full-out farceand not incidentally, the first to take up the case for an unlikable defense: The underdog hero is Jackie DiNorscio (Vin Diesel ), an associate of New Jersey's Lucchese family who, in a real late-'80s mob conspiracy trial that lasted 21 months, chose to represent himself, the only one of 20 defendants to do so. And while Jackie's clowning around before the judge (Ron Silver ) hews strictly to sub My Cousin Vinny  standards, his too- personal questioning of witnesses comes from a deep-seated belief that ratting on friends is wronga code of honor as passionately followed as the one that governed Frank Serpico . (That said, Lumet's Serpico  has bigger laughs.) Find Me Guilty  is overlong and often sitcomy, but it's also pleasantly old-school, with a tone, soundtrack, and even a title-card font that suggest a mellow but not senile Woody Allen . Diesel mugs too hard, but his comedic inexperience dovetails with his character's ignorance of ordinary judicial procedure. There's no reason to feel guilty about finding him funny.
