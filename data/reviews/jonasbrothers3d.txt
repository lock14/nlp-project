To fully savor Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience , it's best to watch with an audience overwhelmingly populated by girls and young women, all of them on their feet singing lyrics like ''Oooh, this is an S.O.S.,''  and squealing every time one of the wildly popular teen-bait hotties mugs for the restless camera. And you're in luck: Squeal-o-vision is pretty much guaranteed at any multiplex screening of Disney's newest puppy-pop  concert film. Fans who know all the words to ''BB Good'' and ''Burnin' Up'' are the target ticket buyers for this chipper, careful brand extension of the sani-packaged boy band composed of 21-year-old Kevin (the fun one),  19-year-old Joe (the cute one), and 16-year-old Nick Jonas (the eerily self-possessed too-young-to-vote one, who   has been singing for a living since he was a  6-year-old New Jersey squirt).
It's fair to ask, under the circumstances, what an oldie like me (now that science has made it possible for women to live past the age of 30!) is doing assessing a movie so clearly made for residents of the state of Hannah Montana, starring lambkins birthed in the breeding pens of the Disney Channel. I'm glad to answer. I may not know much about what  it feels like to be a tween today, trembling with chaste and wholesomely horny longing for three pale young men who strike sexy rocker poses while wearing rings symbolizing their commitment   to premarital virginity. But exactly because I am not  a young aficionada, dressed in a hoodie on which I have inked ''Mrs. Jonas'' in large, hopeful letters, I'm in a good position to   report on what's actually going on up there on the screen while the siblings are working the room. And what's   going on is not necessarily what you see through plastic 3-D glasses.
For one thing, the boys crib openly from the personas that the Beatles so famously established in A Hard Day's Night  45 years ago. In the   Jonases' backstage footage, the brothers assume the roles of playful yet disciplined imps amazed by their own celebrity (and ostentatiously mothered on the road by their   hulking personal bodyguard/nanny, ''Big Rob'' Feggans). For those of us dwelling outside the Jonas demo, the small charms in the ''candid'' moments have little to do with the boys' talents as actors  their  dramatic challenge is to play themselves, supposedly sleeping or eating breakfast  and a lot to do with the revered icons whose cheeky behavior they're imitating. I don't think it's an accident that at one point director Bruce Hendricks (who made last year's Hannah Montana and Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert ) cuts to a shot of the Jonases watching a TV clip of the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show  in 1964  and not just because girls back then squealed for the Fab Four just as they do now for the Theme Park Three. The newbies owe much of their innocents-on-the-run shtick to the Beatles' truly  original charms, and the larky visual style filmmaker Richard Lester devised for the lads from Liverpool.
Then there are the concert segments, shot during the Jonases' Burning Up tour stops   in Anaheim, Calif., and at New York City's   Madison Square Garden. They may scamper and strut but the act is, at heart, as reassuringly square as a church service, with Kevin, Joe, and Nick as altar boyz. Taylor Swift and Demi Lovato also stop by, warbling anthems to female self-worth and moral fortitude. Swift sings, ''You should've said no, you should've gone home/You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go,'' to a straying beau. Amen, sister.
As for the extra-cool format the movie is shot in, not much happens in Disney Digital 3-D that couldn't have happened in Disney Five Minutes Ago 2-D  except for one  unintentionally, hilariously, subliminally dirty bit that will be lost (I hope) on the fervent crowd. I refer to the moment where the  boys grab big fire hoses, hold them like...fire hoses...and spray the heads of their moaning girl fans with thick geysers of, um, foam. The girls respond by holding up their lighted little wands. The whole sequence becomes so phallic that the movie seems to be breaking loose toward Spinal Tap  territory. Then it   returns safely to Disney earth with the   heavenly message encoded in the boys' finger jewelry: Abstinence only, kids!

 “Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience” isn’t a movie so much as a devotional object, a kind of secular fetish designed to induce rapture. Submitting to the experience requires initiation into the teenybopper cult of the Jonas brothers trinity —  Joe, Kevin and Nick —  purveyors of innocuous, repetitive guitar pop and the kind of bland sexuality that provokes a certain type of teenage girl to wait 72 hours in the rain in Times Square for a chance to glimpse the godhead.  Directed with slick banality by Bruce Hendricks, “Jonas Brothers” consists of concert footage from a 2008 Madison Square Garden spectacular supplemented by ridiculous behind-the-scenes tidbits: the brothers pull up to a Virgin Megastore for the midnight release of their new album, fend off a throng of screaming fans, purchase three copies, then pile back into the limo and drive away.  The default camera position places the viewer in a sea of teenage fists clutching glow sticks, cameras or cellphones. Guitar picks are repeatedly — three dimensionally! — chucked at the screen. If you’ve ever wanted to crawl into Kevin’s chest hair, this is as close as you’re likely to get without incurring a restraining order.

The focus is on the fans in Disney�s �Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience,� a gimmick-driven rock doc that alternates between high-energy stereoscopic footage of the group�s Anaheim, Calif., arena show and strategic 2-D bits designed to encourage all those giddy teenage girls that if they only scream loud enough, the Jonas Brothers might materialize in person (to the extent that the siblings plan to greet fans at screenings of their film nationwide). While the recession forces American parents to save, their daughters will be breaking open their piggy banks to buy premium-price tickets to this limited-time spectacle.
To fuel the excitement, director Bruce Hendricks cooks up a �Hard Day�s Night� homage in which fans mob the band�s limo, forcing the guys to climb out the sunroof, make a mad dash through New York traffic and escape by helicopter. The sketch leads directly into three songs from their show, during which the dynamic cameras switch between intimate onstage views and dramatic wide shots taken above the sea of waving glowsticks and outstretched arms.
Though the concert footage takes full advantage of the third dimension (even using visual effects to extend certain Z-axis gags, as when a drumstick, guitar pick or exploding firework is digitally spun off screen), the connecting scenes don�t delve especially deeply into the Jonas Brothers� offstage life. Unlike Hendricks� earlier Hannah Montana 3-D concert doc, which served as a virtual all-access pass to Miley Cyrus as she prepped for the show, the Jonas Brothers �experience� assumes a passing familiarity with the band going in. 
Those who don�t already know the three sibs by name aren�t likely to emerge with a much better sense of their distinct personalities. Oldest brother Kevin (the one with the sideburns) possesses certain Elvis-like qualities, but seems to attract the least applause. Multi-talent Nick plays guitar, keyboard and drums (the band also employs pros on each instrument, as well as an entire string section). And middle kid Joe is clearly the clown of the group, frequently playing to the camera, as in a brief backstage clip when he starts to strip and only then pretends to notice the cameras rolling -- not that parents need worry. Never have three Y chromosomes amid a sea of swooning girls seemed less sexually threatening.
At 76 minutes, the film is nearly twice as long as even the band�s most dedicated admirers might need, with weariness setting in around the 40-minute mark during a song in which the brothers tower above the crowd on big hydraulic pedestals. Their show is full of such stunts -- moving platforms, flaming pyrotechnics, even fire hoses to douse the crowd -- which certainly keep things visually interesting, even as the songs seem to run together. They save their most familiar hits (�S.O.S� and �Burnin� Up�) for late in the show and leave out career-making cover song �Year 3000� altogether.
Instead of practicing choreographed dance routines, the brothers use the stage�s ramps and runways for elaborate gymnastic flips and tricks, making for a highly athletic show. Their natural energy takes the burden off editor Michael Tronick, who had to work harder with solo performer Cyrus. But the technique builds on that earlier feature, keeping the viewing experience smooth without adopting any of the more innovative techniques used by last year�s �U2 3D,� such as overlapping shots and gradual dissolves. Tronick�s editing actually calms down when guest stars Demi Lovato (singing her �Camp Rock� duet) and Taylor Swift drop by, whereas the most hyper cutting occurs when �Big Rob� Feggans emerges to rap alongside the boys.
Big Rob plays a prominent offstage role, doubling as bodyguard and friend to the band. Other between-song segments feature interviews with some of their biggest fans and a visit to Times Square, packed with New Year�s Eve-size crowds, the night of their album debut.
But the centerpiece is new song �Love Is on Its Way,� which the brothers unveil in a 3-D musicvideo shot in Central Park, complete with Village People-worthy costume changes. The final shot of the sequence reveals an enormous crowd gathered to watch the performance -- yet another reminder that the band never forgets its fans. 



Following the franchise template of fellow Hollywood  Records–Disney  property Miley Cyrus , here's a dose of America's favorite soft-serve rockers for the local pubescents. Between 3-D concert clips, the Jonas boys gallivant about Manhattan; thank this movie for NYU 's horrible incoming freshmen girls, circa 2016. Reiterating Hard Day's Night  nods, an incidental montage connects the brothers to a lineage of adolescent heartthrobs. Even in the context of pop-to-statutorily-rape-virgin-eardrums, it's difficult to rate the Jonases. The tunes are no-stick. Presuming the brothers have distinct personalities, they don't shine in the "casual" filler; at best, they're an all–Davy Jones Monkees with varsity soccer co-captain good looks. The chaste Jonases sport promise rings and keep the trouser bulge under control, but some subconscious lasciviousness bubbles up as they jut their microphones out of the screen—and then there's the bit where they hose down the crowd with (and this actually happens) fountains of sticky, white goo. Taking the stage, alongside a platoon of session men riffing for their supper while the boys do their tumbling act, are walk-ons like grinning, dusted sugarplum Demi Lovato  and Miss Taylor Swift , singing her jilted, avenging-angel "Should've Said No." Thanks to intrusive dueting, Swift doesn't top the barn-burning theatrics of her CMA performance, but amid such company, she's positively hardcore.
