When last seen, 20 years ago, John Rambo, that steroidally buff, bandana-wearing killing machine, was out-mujahideening the mujahideen in fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. Now he makes his living catching snakes in northern Thailand. "Too many cobras! More boas!" his boss yells at him.
"Rambo" has been directed, cowritten, and stars Sylvester Stallone. A little more than a year ago he came back as Rocky. Now it's Rambo's turn. He gets around in a rust-bucket motor launch that might be a hand-me-down from "Apocalypse Now." Also, his bow and arrows are no longer the scariest thing about him: He appears to have had an awful lot of bad cosmetic surgery. It's a face only the international box office could love.
A Colorado church group asks Rambo if he can take them upriver, to Burma, to make their annual delivery of medical supplies and Bibles. Sizing them up for the self-righteous annoyances they are (the movie has a rather remarkable anti-clerical streak), Rambo declines. But when the sole female in the group (Julie Benz, not bad in a thankless role) asks, beast bonds with beauty and Rambo grunts his assent.
A good thing, too, since he has to save them from river pirates. Not that the church folk appreciate this. "Taking a life is never right," the group's sanctimonious leader (Paul Schulze) sniffs at Rambo. Clearly, he has no idea who he's talking to, and rejects Rambo's offer of help once they reach their destination.
Faith can move mountains. It can even move Rambo. It cannot, however, move the Burmese army, which shoots up the village where the group sets up shop. The surviving members are taken prisoner.
The church's minister (Ken Howard) shows up on Rambo's doorstep and asks him to take upriver a group of mercenaries he's hired - sometimes you turn the other cheek, and sometimes you just don't - in an effort to rescue his parishioners.
It's pretty easy to figure out the rest.
"Rambo" isn't dull. It is, however, often murkily directed, a real shortcoming in an action movie. In the big rescue-the-prisoners sequence, it's very hard to keep track of who is doing what to whom where. There's a silly flashback montage in black-and-white (hey, there's Richard Crenna!) for filmgoers who've missed the previous three Rambo movies. And the violence level keeps ratcheting up, to near-sickening effect: limb removal, decapitation, disembowelment. Much of "Rambo" could be a recruitment video for abattoir work. The idea of anyone under, say, 16 seeing this movie is insane.
None of this is beyond what you'd expect - or fear - from a Rambo movie. What is inexcusable is the moral self-congratulation the movie trades on, attaching itself to the plight of the Burmese people. Or has Stallone been holding out on us all these years, and John Rambo is secretly a member of Amnesty International?


So how does a broody Vietnam vet with a long-term case of post-traumatic stress disorder keep busy in the backwaters of Thailand for 20 years between Rambo III    and the sequel called just plain Rambo ? Judging from the appearance of Sylvester Stallone, who co-wrote, directed, and stars in the hell-with-it-all bloody fourth run of the stomping action franchise, John James Rambo at 61 has kept fit via a regular regimen of wrangling poisonous snakes, running a longboat, and keeping his head bandannas clean. Unfortunately, that quiet life is interrupted by a party of howlingly naïve Christian missionaries and medics from Colorado who request Rambo's navigational services. The do-gooders are headed upriver to assist ethnic Karen refugees in Burma (apparently no one's told Rambo that the country's called Myanmar now), underdogs who have been fighting a brutal civil war with the ruling military junta for 60 years.
The fools have chosen a profoundly dangerous route, of course, as befits any war pic involving the word ''upriver.'' It's a given that Rambo will initially say no , followed by grrr . Also a given is the capture of the hapless missionaries, the arrival of a search party of colorful mercenaries, and Rambo's mournful decision to blow all of Burma to hell to rescue the hopeless lot of them  mercenaries and missionaries alike. Baby-stabbing, decapitation, gang rape, and rivers of blood: Rambo  is up to its boot tops in numbing violence.
The brutality, tough enough to take, would be intolerable if Stallone didn't toss the movie like a cant-clearing grenade at notions of stay-the-course righteousness (not to mention at the sermonizing of more faith-based agonies staged by Mel Gibson). Rambo  teaches that fighting sucks, good intentions can be futile, and coalitions of the willing are a charade: A man's got to do what a man's got to do. Sometimes that means tying on the old bandanna to hack one's way out of the Hollywood jungle so disorienting to aging action stars.

 Has it really been 20 years? Last time we saw John Rambo, in 1988, he was involved in some cold war endgame stuff in Afghanistan, and his action-movie franchise, begun in 1982 with “First Blood,” seemed to be sputtering toward self-parody. Since then Rambo has faded into semi-obscurity, though his name is sometimes still used, perhaps a bit unfairly, as a synonym for revanchist, go-it-alone militarism.  When I saw the posters announcing his imminent return, I wondered whom he would be fighting this time. In “Rambo: First Blood Part II,” the cumbersomely titled centerpiece of the earlier trilogy, he went back to Vietnam to collect payback both from the Communists and, indirectly, from the pusillanimous desk jockeys who supposedly messed up that war the first time around. Given this résumé, it seemed reasonable to assume that now he might be heading back to Central Asia to hunt down Osama bin Laden, a job no one else seems inclined to tackle.  But it turns out I misjudged Rambo, and maybe also Sylvester Stallone, who directed and wrote (with Art Monterastelli) the newest “Rambo,” and who plays the title character. When we first encounter him, this weary warrior has retreated from geopolitics, passing the time at a remote river station in the Thai jungle, where he hunts poisonous snakes and dabbles in blacksmithing. Old Rambo seems kind of depressed, to tell the truth, until his wrath is stirred by the viciousness of the Burmese Army.  Burma? But why not Burma? (In this movie, no one calls it Myanmar.) As a precredit montage of actual news clips reminds us, the military government of that nation has been engaged not only in widespread authoritarian abuses but also in a brutal, long-running campaign against the Karen ethnic minority. And it is with the Karen that Rambo, once roused from his weary cynicism, throws in his lot. No longer the bloody avatar of wounded American pride, he seems more inclined toward humanitarian intervention — a one-man N.G.O. with a machete. Will he show up in Darfur next?  Not that he is motivated by abstract moral concern. (And not that he is entirely alone. Some grumpy mercenaries are on hand to add firepower and profanity to the cause.) With Rambo, the political is always personal. He temporarily joins the Karen cause because some Western aid workers, carrying only Bibles, medical supplies and an air of sanctimony, hire him to ferry them upriver into Burma. He is skeptical about their mission, and their leader (Paul Schulze) seems like kind of a jerk, but something about Sarah (Julie Benz), the only woman in the group, touches Rambo’s soul. This is not a matter of sexual desire, but rather the kind of spiritual awakening that can be expressed only in misty abstractions. (“What you’re trying to do is change what is?” “And what is?” “Go home.”)  Sarah wonders why Rambo —  she calls him John — has stayed away from the United States for so long. (This is partly answered in a dream sequence flashing back to some of the earlier episodes.) “Don’t you want to see what’s changed?” she asks. One thing that has is that women in action movies are encouraged to do their own fighting, but Mr. Stallone is old school in this regard. Blowing heads off and slicing abdomens is man’s work. Ms. Benz is on hand to scream, gasp, fall in the mud and huddle in a damp bamboo cage, waiting to be raped by the Burmese bad guys or rescued by Rambo.  And these bad guys make the Vietcong in the second Rambo movie look like paintball-slinging weekend warriors. “Rambo” is, for most of its fairly brief running time, a blood bath punctuated by occasional bouts of clumsy dialogue. There are beheadings, mutilations, disembowelings — enough gore to rival “Apocalypto.”  But the movie does have its own kind of blockheaded poetry. The first installments in the cycle were better films than polite opinion might lead you to believe. At the time their politics made some people nervous, but to dwell on Rambo’s ideological significance was (and still is) to miss his kinship with the samurais and gunslingers of older movies. Mr. Stallone is smart enough — or maybe dumb enough, though I tend to think not — to present the mythic dimensions of the character without apology or irony. His face looks like a misshapen chunk of granite, and his acting is only slightly more expressive, but the man gets the job done. Welcome back.  “Rambo” is rated R  (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).  It has unhinged, sadistic genocidal violence and righteous retribution for same.

The Sylvester Stallone nostalgia tour that began with another "Rocky" continues with this fourth "Rambo." Although Stallone plays it completely straight, the mere idea of the aging action star strapping on the bandana again is risible enough to let the movie play like a comedy too, albeit one with an unusually high body count. So while much of the audience will show up to admire what armored-piercing weapons do to human flesh, others can giggle at the notion of Rambo's return in a movie that doesn't risk gumming up its carnage with much of a plot.
Based on "Rocky's" scorecard, box office should be initially robust, which will be welcome if only to compensate the movie's 11 executive producers -- evidence of the business contortions required to engineer Rambo's comeback, with Stallone as co-writer and director as well as reprising his starring role.
In a sense, the timing is strangely appropriate, inasmuch as "Rambo" wound up being a kind of referendum on Vietnam, advancing the theory that the war was winnable if only we'd let Rambo do his job, leaving him to pay (and pay and pay) for all his countrymen's sins back home. Given the current debate over Iraq, this latest bloodbath perhaps wisely steers clear of those landmines, though they remain unavoidable subtext to anybody who knows the character's history.
Although Rambo made his debut in 1982, he was last seen 20 years ago fighting alongside the Afghan Mujahadeen against the Soviet incursion -- "Charlie Wilson's War," if you will, with more explosions and less dialogue.
The new film -- which goes without a "IV" anywhere -- finds the ex-Green Beret killing machine living in Thailand and paying the rent by capturing snakes, looking leathery and sounding gravelly on those occasions where he deigns to speak with something more than a weary, withering stare.
Recruited to ferry a church group of idealistic doctors on a humanitarian mission to Burma, he balks at first, citing the dangerous civil war there. Indeed, the Burmese in the movie largely break into two barely human categories: cannon fodder; and sadistic butchers who graphically slaughter entire villages of men, women and children, the better to unleash the righteous wrath of you-know-who.
Among the missionaries is Sarah (Julie Benz of Showtime's "Dexter"), who in a brief exchange melts Rambo's heart enough to prompt him to guide them upriver and into No Man's Land. When Sarah and her companions are taken prisoner, he agrees to return with a small mercenary force, setting up a battle sequence against impossible odds. It spoils nothing to say that while the opposing army is said to number 100, roughly 10 times that many seem to die, often losing limbs in showers of gore.
Despite being set in the jungle and lensed in Thailand, the movie has an oddly washed-out look, and some sequences look like they could have been shot in Griffith Park. Multiple scenes, moreover, are staged during driving rainstorms, which, like the modest running time (roughly 80 minutes before the credit scroll begins), perhaps helps obscure a limited budget.
Then again, the world of Rambo is equally dreary, a place where a do-gooder doctor (Paul Schulze) who says "Taking a life is never right" is clearly due a rude awakening. As for Rambo, he not only knows killing is justified but, after a gauzy flashback, grudgingly accepts that it's the only thing he really does well.
Stallone (who looks fit but mostly keeps his shirt on) has no intention of bogging the action down, but it's still a notably cheerless exercise, without knowing winks or stabs (pardon the expression) at humor. It is in all respects, rather, a completely workmanlike effort, providing just enough background on the Burmese thugs to pave the way for their comeuppance.
Watching Rambo pilot his boat and ragtag crew down the river, in fact, brought to mind a line from the atmospherically similar "Apocalypse Now," albeit slightly altered for the occasion: He wanted a movie, and for our sins, they gave him one.

A veteran now in his 60s (as well as of  them), Rambo has chosen to spend his retirement in deepest Thailand , dreamily fishing with a bow and arrow or capturing cobras for a backwater snake show. He's still wearing his trademark bandanna  (over a wig hat, unless the still-luxuriant  coiffure is a function of the HGH that the star has admitted using). More to the point, he remains unreconciled, still nursing that thousand-yard stare and schlepping a cargo of resentment. Rambo's first line of dialogue is the traditional "Fuck off!," delivered over his shoulder at his jabbering gook boss.
What crisis has disturbed the creature's slumber and brought him back to life? Iraq , Iran , North Korea , Hugo Chávez ? Somewhere in the Ramboverse, there's been a chemical-weapon attackit's the crisis in Burma ! Accompanied by newsreels too grisly for the Human Rights Film Festival, Rambo explains that Christian farmers have been singled out for extermination, their rice paddies turned into killing fields. Rambo is approached by a church-sponsored group of idealistic American doctors looking for a way to enter Burma and save a bit of the world. Will he ferry them upriver? "Fuck the world," he tells the group's wimpy leader (Paul Schulze ).
The expedition's lone woman (Julie Benz ) tries to reason with the Rambot: "We're here to make a difference," she insists. "What is is what is," he explains Buddhistically. But when she remarks that he must have believed in something once, Rambo relents. Naturally, his worst fears about human nature are immediately confirmed once their boat is attacked by slavering river pirates who want nothing more than to kidnap and ravish the White Woman. Rambo liquefies the scum. The Christians are appalled ("Taking a life is never right," the Schulze character whines), but the mission continues.
A sort of parody Apocalypse Now , complete with listless coochie dancers entertaining the Burmese troops, the movie finds its own heart of darkness once Rambo drops the doctors in Burma. No sooner have they begun nursing the maimed and ministering to the mutilated when ka-BLAAAAM!!!!!! The local storm troopers attack, stabbing children, blowing up houses, massacring old people, and making off with the WWthe village left looking like Jonestown  after the Kool-Aid .
Rambo  has the feel of a terminal Vietnam  flick. The absence of choppers hovering like angels overhead only reinforces the sense of abandonment in this green hell. Smeary black-and-white clips from Rambo: First Blood Part II  establish historical perspective, such as it is, and function as the turgid nightmare from which the hero is trying to awakeand which is, in fact, interrupted by another pastor pleading with him to help rescue the captives. Strapping on his mega-bowie knife and leading a band of screwball mercenaries into the jungle ("Live for nothing or die for something"), Rambo penetrates the storm trooper stronghold just as the rape orgy commences and initiates his own bloodbath. It's a reasonably entertaining spectacle replete with half-animated action sequences in which CGI bodies disintegrate like breakaway bottles.
After 20 years in remission, Rambo remains tough enough to rip out a guy's throat with one hand, smart enough to assemble something like a tactical nuclear device while galumphing through the underbrush with Burmese police dogs nipping at his keister, and noble enough to pose for Mount Rushmore . He finishes the job and, his curiosity whetted by the White Woman, goes home to "the world." But this is where, 26 years ago, First Blood  begancan the Rambodyssey really be over?
At once cowboy and Indian, GI and VC, Rambo was arguably the great pop icon of the Vietnam War. Or rather, this puppy-eyed, Nautilus-built killing machine was the great pop icon of the decade-after Vietnam War revisionism that characterized the reign of Ronald Reagan . It's as though the ongoing political discourse, with some politicians claiming to be the new Reagan and others denying it, had conjured his reappearance: Rambo redux.
Back in 1982, First Blood  gave the cliché of the psychotic Vietnam vet a novel twist. Driven to run amok in the Pacific Northwest , Stallone's sweet but implacable Green Beret  was misunderstood and unappreciated. He was a victim not only of the war overseas but the one at home another longhair vagrant persecuted by the pigs. First Blood  was constructed to appeal to hawks and doves alike and, however schematic, struck a responsive chord. It was an unexpected hit, the movie that dethroned ET  as the nation's No. 1 box-office attraction and gave Stallone his first real success outside the Rocky  cycle, returning him to the charmed circle of bankable stars.
Three years later, Rambo: First Blood Part II  provided Stallone the muscle to elbow aside Clint Eastwood  at the top of the list. Sprung from the prison where his earlier rampage landed him, the Green Beret extraordinaire was recruited to parachute back into Nam on a 36-hour mission to find and photograph 2,500 MIAs (who are actually POWs). Bucking orders, he leads them to freedom. The scenario effectively reworked the previous year's Uncommon Valor  and Missing in Action , with a greater body count and more explicit meaning. "Sir, do we win this time?" Rambo plaintively asks his Green Beret guru. Affirmative to the max!
