If 40 is the new 30, no one bothered to tell screenwriter Paul Haggis (Crash
, Million Dollar Baby)
, whose script work here, itself an adaptation of Gabriele Muccino's 2001 film L'Ultimo Bacio
, has an ensemble cast of late-twentysomethings reeling away in horror at the approach of their dreaded, triple-decade birthdays. Garden State
's Braff is Michael, an architect who appears content with his life and the fact that he and his longtime girlfriend, Jenna (Barrett), are well under way on the baby track. But while attending the wedding of a friend, Michael is suddenly privy to all manner of champagne-fueled screeds about the "marriage trap," and, retiring to a nearby tree house (this is Michigan, after all), he meets cute college co-ed Kim (The OC
's Bilson), a meeting that primes the third-act powderkeg of a plot, resulting in some spectacular emotional fireworks from nearly the entire cast. One of the finer pleasures of The Last Kiss
' ensemble cast and multigenerational story is the portrayal of the 30-year-old marriage between Jenna's parents (Danner and Wilkinson), who give quietly riveting performances of the utmost nuance and sympathy, despite connubial troubles of their own. You could say The Last Kiss
 is something of a Garden State
 redux, but Braff's character here is less fanciful, less melodramatic, and far more prone to both thinking and doing the thoughtless things men tend to do when faced with lifetime milestones such as babies, marriages, mortgages, or rationalizing the potential bangability of that coltish co-ed in the passenger seat. Haggis has proven himself adept at fleshing out the backstories and front-loaded presents and futures of sprawling casts, as he does here, but without the spot-on acting talent from Affleck, Weston, and Olsen, who are all dealing with their own separated relationship crises, The Last Kiss
 would almost certainly feel like a stale retread of any one of a number of European romcom exports. Thanks to Haggis and the cast, who are convincing, often bitingly so, in their willingness to dive into the dark and unknowable depths of the modern American romantic relationship, The Last Kiss
 mirrors reality with remarkable faithfulness, including not just the good sex and couch cuddling but also the sudden, vindictive squalls and hope-destroying tsunamis of emotion, fear of exclusion, fear of responsibility, and fear of having to sleep on your own front porch in the rain because of that damnably bangable co-ed. Idiot.


``The Last Kiss" is a seriocomic pity party for 30-year-old men who are terrified of maturity, and I suppose it'll strike some guys out there as God's own truth. To others, the film may just seem intensely irritating, for its unexamined fear of women, for its refusal to draw real dramatic blood, and for its unholy use of Coldplay songs.
Directed by actor-turned-director Tony Goldywn and written by Paul (``Crash") Haggis, ``Kiss" is a remake of the 2001 Italian film ``L'Ultimo Bacio," retooled to an America of sensitive, scared males. It very much wants to be ``Garden State" five years down the line.
The hero, Michael (Zach Braff), is an architect -- what's with all the architects in movies lately? -- who has just learned his longtime girlfriend, Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), is pregnant. This news fills him with delight when he's talking to Jenna and deer-in-headlights panic at all other times. So he's open to the flirty invitations of a nubile college student named Kim (Rachel Bilson of ``The O.C.") he meets at a wedding. What she sees in him is never quite clear; Braff, so sharp on TV's ``Scrubs," rarely leaves sad-sack mode here.
His friends are in similar arrested pickles. Co-worker Chris (Casey Affleck, very good) is married with a baby son, but his wife (Lauren Lee Smith) is driving him crazy with demands that he change a diaper or two. Izzy (Michael Weston) has been dumped by his
 girlfriend (Marley Shelton) and is contemplating turning stalker or fleeing the country. The only one of the gang who has it all -- looks, hair, the continued ability to enjoy casual sex with gorgeous women -- is Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen), and he shies like a filly from the first sign of commitment.
The central drama is whether Michael will sleep with the absurdly available Kim and, more important, whether he'll be able to tell Jenna about all the not-nice stuff banging around in his head. In other words, whether he'll stop lying to her. Being a Hollywood movie with TV stars, though, ``The Last Kiss" wants us to like these boys even when they're behaving badly, and that keeps it from any real insights into why men can be jerks.
And they can
 be jerks: The arrival of marriage, babies, and one's 30s is certainly the occasion for tortuous self-examination. (It's called growing up, fellas, and once upon a time, before the culture started insisting our youths can go on forever, it took place in your 20s or even earlier.) And, yes, many of us edit our thoughts before they reach the ears of our loved ones, for reasons of both tact and anxiety. These things do resonate.
Yet for all the toes stepped on and trusts betrayed in ``The Last Kiss," there's never any lasting damage. Haggis' s script has the same airless predetermination that haunted ``Crash" -- the same cramped democracy of character that keeps it from breathing the air of life as it's actually lived. (The writer loves emotional messes so long as they're tidy.)
In the end, it's the characters who are betrayed, particularly the women. Chris' s wife is an exhausted shrew, end of story. The college girl's a siren, then a clinger. Jenna is smotheringly affectionate until she becomes a hellhound of fury. What about their
 fears? ``The Last Kiss" pays them lip service but it's never really interested. Whatever you say, honey.
That leaves poor Blythe Danner up a tree as Anna, Jenna's mother: a vibrant woman in a rage at her husband (Tom Wilkinson) for being a dull saint. Danner makes the character's righteous anger marvelous and moving to behold; she wants to tear down her suburban stronghold and to hell with the consequences. You wish the movie were about her. It isn't, though. It's about forgiving the boys.
And about pop songs in place of earned emotion. Is this where Simon and Garfunkel on the soundtrack of ``The Graduate" have led us? To wall-to-wall Snow Patrol and Aimee Mann cueing us to sigh in canned understanding? As with ``Garden State" and ``Elizabethtown," ``The Last Kiss" is an iPod playlist in search of a movie, and what it loses in honest drama it will surely make up for in sales of the CD.
Fine, but Tony Goldwyn was able to combine period pop and
 hard human quandaries in 1999's ``A Walk on the Moon," his first film as director and still his best. You'll probably come out of ``The Last Kiss" wanting to buy the soundtrack. That doesn't mean you have to buy the movie as well.


         "The Last Kiss" is directed by Tony Goldwyn and written by Paul Haggis and based on the Italian movie "L'Ultimo Bacio." Unlike the Italian movie, this one is set in Madison, Wis., which has never looked more elegant or more temperate, or less Midwestern and fringy and bohemian than it does here. When a character mentions quitting his job at the cheese factory, I thought for a second he was referring to a cute gourmet shop. At one point, the protagonist refers to his girlfriend's breasts as her "breasts." Needless to say, no O's were flattened in the making of this picture.
 
  That's not to suggest that Madison is not a nice place, just that "The Last Kiss" feels terminally generic and tone-deaf. An ensemble drama about four male friends warily facing adulthood at the advanced age of 29, the movie feels weirdly asynchronous. There's something about "Last Kiss," beginning with its eye-rollingly mournful title, that smacks of a previous generation's nostalgia for the salad days — a nostalgia that's been amply dramatized already. It's not that the guys seem too old to be clinging to adolescence, they just seem too young 
for all their sweater-clad grimness. The events may be on track, but the existential despair smacks of midlife. I kept waiting for Alan Alda to show up.
 


         






    Zach Braff and Jacinda Barrett play Michael and Jenna, a couple who have just found out they are expecting a baby. This being Madison in the 21st century, Jenna's parents (played by Tom Wilkinson and Blythe Danner) thrill at the news, even though the kids aren't married yet. This being a minor nod to Barry Levinson's "Diner," however, Michael turns to stone at the mention of marriage (Jenna is reduced to calling it "the M-word"), even though they already live together in a large, catalog-decorated duplex next door to a gay, biracial couple and spend plenty of quality time with the virtual in-laws. Despite having been deeply imprinted by "thirtysomething," apparently as a small child, Michael actually lets phrases such as "I'll marry you when you can name five marriages that have lasted more than five years" escape his lips. Unfortunately for Jenna, the only couple she can come up with are her parents, Stephen, a psychiatrist, and his aptly named wife, Anna. And they aren't doing so well. Anna's constant demands for attention include asking such things as, "What would you do if I died?" (He: "I'd iron my dark suit.") Soon, she is moving out, looking up an old lover and sobbing on a treadmill.
 
  If Michael is losing it, his friend Chris (Casey Affleck), with whom he works at a trendy architecture firm, is two steps ahead of him. Tortured by a harpy wife and a constantly screaming baby, Chris spends a lot of time in the bathroom contemplating divorce. Izzy (Michael Weston), meanwhile, is reeling from having been dumped by his girlfriend and wants to travel to South America on a motorcycle. (He eventually settles for an RV.) Meanwhile, Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) bartends for a living, sleeps around for fun and turns heel and scrams at the slightest whiff of commitment.
 
  At the wedding of a fifth friend, Michael is approached by a pretty college sophomore named Kim (Rachel Bilson), whose appearance at the event is never quite explained. ("My friends wanted to leave as soon as we got here," she tells him, as though they'd mistaken it for a bar and wandered in.) Kim takes Michael's mute stiffness as a sign to extend an invitation to meet her after class, which he stiffly accepts. All of this stiffness is meant to indicate Michael's guilt-ridden ambivalence, caught as he is between the "perfect woman" at home and the "little brunet" who keeps trying to lure him away, but it just makes him look like a passive-aggressive creep — as does, come to think of it, almost everything he does and says.
 
  And what of Jenna and the other girls? Let's just say that the movie makes it clear that hormones and exhaustion/betrayal/disappointment don't mix. Jenna is cruelly divested of all of her romantic illusions in the span of a few days, but where the experience takes her is hard to say. Like her mother and her friends, she mostly just reacts. From menopausal mom to boy-crazy sophomore, the women in "Last Kiss" are so unstable, so needy and so reckless it's a wonder anybody survives them. They'll throw perfume bottles at your head. They'll show up at work and try to give you presents. They'll get crazy with the cutlery. They'll try to introduce you to their parents. Tierra del Fuego, here you come.
 
  I could be wrong, but it seems unlikely that Michael's domestic and professional setup would elicit the same acute dread in people in their 20s as it did for their parents. The archetype of the vaguely-dissatisfied-successful-creative-professional-in-a-sweater-who-has-it-all-but-just-doesn't-know-it-yet is as moldy as they come; and fear of financial stability is not quite as rampant as it once was. In one scene, Michael accompanies Kim to a dorm and tells her "You make me feel 10 years younger." Is there really a 29-year-old guy on the planet who would say this to a teenager he wants to sleep with? If so, this is the movie for him. Maybe he'll be able to identify with Michael's fear of "no more surprises" too, now that the world is so full of such nasty ones.

If it's true that, for women, 60 is the new 40, must it follow that, for men, 30 is the new 10? That's the emotional math at work in The Last Kiss , an alarming male wallow passing as a fetching date-night dramedy in which four men entering their fourth decade  friends since childhood  respond with lunkheaded awfulness to the mysteries of women, each in his own lunkish way.
Michael (Zach Braff), on whose good-guy appeal the whole movie hinges, is rattled enough by the unexpected pregnancy of his longtime girlfriend, Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), to be tempted by a college-age spitfire (Rachel Bilson) who simultaneously bites her lip, twists her hands girlishly, and comes on to him as forcefully as Catherine Zeta-Jones on the red carpet. Chris (Casey Affleck) makes it clear he can't stand his exhausted wife or their infant son for reasons never explained except that she nags at him, maybe because he seems to spend more time with the gang than at home, sharing in the joy of diapers. Hysteria-prone doofus Izzy (Michael Weston from Braff's Garden State ) can't believe that his icy girlfriend (Marley Shelton) dumped him, and he continues to pine/whine for her, loudly. Kenny (Dumb and Dumberer 's Eric Christian Olsen), who enjoys life as a freelance swordsman, freaks when the hot babe he's been fooling around with wants to introduce him to her parents. The horror!
To be fair, this porelessly photogenic ensemble, under the direction of Tony Goldwyn (Someone Like You ) and working from a script by Crash  screenplay Oscar winner Paul Haggis, adds little that wasn't already available for American retrofitting in Gabriele Muccino's 2001 Italian trifle, L'Ultimo Bacio , also released in the U.S. in 2002 as The Last Kiss : same pregnancy crisis, same temptation from a younger woman. And in both films, representatives of an older generation enact marital crises born of staleness, too. (Here, the middle-aged malcontents are Jenna's parents, with Tom Wilkinson playing to In the Bedroom  type as an inexpressive hubby while Blythe Danner shoots sparklers of angry energy as an aging beauty hungering to be desired.)
But the sense of petulant, self-actualized entitlement brought to this Last Kiss  is the remake's very special, curdled contribution to pop culture and to roles for high-profile Gen-X actors. The implied public service announcement  that pregnancy is a useful time for a couple pushing 30 to grow the hell up  might be more palatable if the movie didn't simultaneously suggest that life always works out just fine for all characters as well costumed and lit as this lot. While Braff, complemented by Barrett's dignified performance, does as much as the setup allows to demonstrate the payoff of acting one's age rather than one's shoe size, way too much of the movie is pitched to the doofus/Izzy demographic. Evidently, movie marketers feel safest planting sloppy, tolerant kisses on the heads of moviegoers coddled like a bunch of big babies.

 Is 30 the new 50, or is it the new 12? This is one of the questions implicitly raised by “The Last Kiss,” which is not so much a coming-of-age story as it is yet another story about how hard it is, these days, to act your age.  The main character, Michael (Zach Braff), has a nice job, a lovely, newly pregnant girlfriend named Jenna (Jacinda Barrett) and a squad of loyal buddies. When he complains that he feels as if  he’s “in crisis” as his 20’s near their end, he sounds precociously middle-age. At the same time, though, he behaves less like a man for whom adulthood is already a burden than like a child for whom maturity is a scary and seductive abstraction.  The refusal of young (or not so young) men to grow up has been the subject of magazine articles and advice books since long before many of us reached voting age. If anything, such arrested development has been a theme in movies for even longer.  “The Last Kiss,” Tony Goldwyn’s remake of a popular Italian film from 2001, belongs to a venerable tradition that can be traced, through “Diner” and “American Graffiti,” all the way back to another Italian movie, “I Vitelloni.” In that great 1953 film, directed by Federico Fellini, a group of young men chased girls and evaded responsibility until the father of one of them lost patience and went after his son with a belt. While I can’t condone the brutality of his methods, I couldn’t help but wish that a similarly no-nonsense patriarchal figure would show up and whip some sense into Mr. Braff and his pals.  Instead, Tom Wilkinson, playing Michael’s would-be father-in-law, a professional therapist, offers mild reproof and fatherly advice during the movie’s explosive climax. There are perfectly sound dramatic reasons for his reserve, and in any case it is consistent with the movie’s gentle, tolerant view of its characters, a perspective that proves to be  a limitation and something of a surprise.  “The Last Kiss,” directed by Mr. Goldwyn (“A Walk on the Moon”) from a script by the estimable Paul Haggis (“Crash,” “Million Dollar Baby”), inherits from its source a crowded, glib story. But it also, unusually for an American remake of a European original, preserves the earlier film’s candor about human behavior. Most major-studio releases treat romantic love  with cynical, coarsening prurience or with an equally cynical sentimentality —  sometimes both, as was the case with “Wedding Crashers” last summer.    The fallibility of the romantic ideal —  which is nonetheless indispensable on screen and off —  is something Hollywood has trouble dealing with. “The Break-up,” in which Jennifer Aniston and Vince Vaughan did just what the title promised, would have been a more notable exception if it were anything like a good movie. “The Last Kiss,” while not quite a good movie either, at least deserves credit for its honesty.  Which is not a trait it shares with its hero. At a wedding, Michael meets Kim (Rachel Bilson), a cute, skinny college student who seems to be attracted to him, and without quite meaning to —  but also without stopping himself —  he pushes their flirtation into something more dangerous. Scared by impending fatherhood, he is also worried that settling down with Jenna will drain all the surprise from his life. He observes his friend and co-worker Chris (Casey Affleck) as the pressures of parenthood cause his already fragile marriage to buckle.  Meanwhile, another friend, Izzy (Michael Weston), is still miserably stuck on the long-time girlfriend who dumped him, while Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen), the heedless stud of the bunch, finds sexual fulfillment —  strenuous but meaningless —  with a woman he picked up at the same wedding at which  Michael met Kim.  Mr. Goldwyn arranges these subplots in a jostling, restless counterpoint so that “The Last Kiss” sometimes feels like an entire season of a television series crammed into less than two hours, full of activity, but lacking shape. Michael’s emotional predicament also unfolds alongside a crisis in the marriage of Jenna’s parents, as her mother (Blythe Danner) tires of her cold, sarcastic mate (Mr. Wilkinson) and tries vainly to reconnect with an old flame (Harold Ramis).  None of these developments —  or a conveniently timed death in Izzy’s family —  is given the dramatic room it requires, and after a while the movie starts to feel thin and threadbare. Ms. Barrett is a glowing, lovely presence, but her character exists in the penumbra of Michael’s narcissism, and the filmmakers seem not to have much interest in her beyond her almost symbolic function as the embodiment of domesticity and incipient motherhood. We never learn the subject of her dissertation, and we also don’t understand what she sees in Michael.  Mr. Braff’s panicky passivity is its own kind of magnetism, I guess. His wobbly chin and startled eyes might be taken for evidence of sweetness, and he is certainly a credible incarnation  of the kind of mopey, wet-noodle hipster lately ubiquitous in independent movies, unsigned rock bands and certain Brooklyn neighborhoods. But the challenge of conveying both Michael’s weakness and his decency —  the qualities that lead him astray and those that make him worthy of forgiveness —  seems entirely beyond him.  Ms. Barrett, by contrast, seems to be playing a grown woman, which makes her  a more sympathetic character and also, given the film’s skewed allegiances, a less interesting one. Jenna’s role is to save Michael from his worst impulses, and Ms. Barrett very nearly saves “The Last Kiss” as well by giving full voice to the rage, hurt and humiliation that follow Michael’s betrayal. In the end, though, you can’t shake the feeling that Michael deserved worse, and she deserved better — than him, and than this earnest, confused movie.  “The Last Kiss” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, sexual situations and strong language.

Reps of three generations in contempo Madison, Wis., grapple with commitment, infidelity, hot tempers and cold feet in "The Last Kiss." Nicely thesped and adequately involving narrative tackles issues well worth examining in a manner accessible to everyone. But the closest most of the protags get to genuine chemistry is when in proximity to a science building on campus. All-American adaptation by Paul Haggis of Gabriele Muccino's 2001 Italian hit "L'Ultimo bacio" is chummy, consensual and always watchable in Tony Goldwyn's polished rendition of emotional messiness. Pic should smooch with acceptable B.O. results.
Yank version hews closely to the Italian template but trades the sprightly original's frantic pace for a rhythm better suited to Zach Braff's lowkey brand of existential panic. Voiceover from Michael (Braff) reveals he will hit 30 next month. While having dinner with Jenna (Jacinda Barrett), his girlfriend of three years, and her parents, Anna (Blythe Danner) and Stephen (Tom Wilkinson), Jenna announces she's 10 weeks pregnant.
Unsettled by the prospect of settling down and raising a child -- not to mention spending less time with his three childhood buddies -- Michael, an architect, boasts the demeanor of a human deer caught in the headlights of imminent adulthood. When perky college sophomore Kim (Rachel Bilson) gloms on to Michael, offering sex and adoration in record time, Michael flirts with disaster and all hell breaks loose.
Michael's pals face crises and obstacles of their own, with the sometimes lopsided ensembler contriving to dole out at least one Big Issue per customer. Izzy (Michael Weston) can't take another minute in the cheese biz and, weepy and volatile, refuses to accept that his childhood sweetheart has left him.
Chris (Casey Affleck) and wife Lisa (Lauren Lee Smith) thought having a baby might save their relationship, but the arrival of their son has only accentuated their problems. Slacker Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen) tends bar and beds babes; when he meets Danielle (Cindy Sampson), his ideal match in female form, he bolts.
Braff is always fun to watch, and Danner and Wilkinson can do no wrong. Situational humor is structurally sound, and yet the aggregate result of all this Sturm und Drang is more distancing than involving. The convincingly flawed characters make more dumb moves than smart ones, but it rarely feels as if the psyches on display are really on the line. Result makes for more of a cautionary tale than a rollicking entertainment, although there are multiple laughs along the way.
Tweaks and adjustments from the original include turning the Kim character from an 18-year-old who lives with her parents to a 20-year-old with a dorm room and eliminating the Izzy character's relationship with his ailing father.
Haggis has sharply embellished a crucial dialogue scene between Braff's and Wilkinson's characters to excellent effect. A revelation and advice from an older man to a younger one leads to a rewardingly intense reshuffling of events en route to an open ending of a sort not often seen in mainstream American films.
Lensing is efficient, score unobtrusive.

Those twentysomethings, poor dears, can never catch a break in the movies. First this maligned generation is told, in countless gritty indies and perky studio comedies, that they're rowing through life without oars. Now, director Tony Goldwyn 's admirably understated handling of dispiritingly slender material suggests that if you're pushing 30, you're likely to be fuddy-duddy before your time. Evidently that's a good thing.
The topic sentence of Paul Haggis 's screenplay (adapted from Gabriele Muccino 's milquetoast 2001 movie of the same name) whacks you over the head early on, when 29-year-old Michael (Zach Braff ), a slacker disguised as an architect, announces in desperation that everyone he knows is "in crisis." Never mind that he and everyone he knows are a tad young to be wringing their hands over hearth and home versus the wild side, but there it is. Michael, whose girlfriend, Jenna (a poised Jacinda Barrett ), is several weeks into her first pregnancy, signals his panicked unreadiness for fatherhood by affirming his undying love for the strong and steady Jenna while gazing into the middle distance with furrowed brow. Their immediate circle of friendssome old before their time, some unattractively parked in never-never landface (or rather do their darnedest to avoid) similar life-cycle dilemmas, and it comes as no surprise when a coopful of chickens comes to roost at the lavish wedding of a foolishly radiant acquaintance.
Fielding a come-hither glance from firm-young-fleshed Kim (The O.C.  's Rachel Bilson ), a chipper college student whose assets include an overweening affection for the color purple and the pronunciation of "crisises" with the barest hint of an adorable lithp, Michael sets limply about throwing away what's best in his life, while his best pals, each according to his type, follow suit. Chris (Casey Affleck ) is trying to reconcile new fatherhood with a dead-in-the-water marriage, while Izzy (Michael Weston ), smarting over being dumped by his girlfriend, and Kenny (Eric Christian Olsen ), ready to bed any woman as allergic to monogamy as he is, doggedly pursue the kind of single life that wouldn't appeal to a dog.
Goldwyn, an actor who turned director with the delightful 1999 drama A Walk on the Moon , directs here with a precise appreciation for those moments when life forces into the open the unhappiness you've been stubbornly sitting on for years. (In one of the movie's best and, significantly, wordless scenes, Jenna's mother, played by Blythe Danner , holes up under a table, her aristocratic features puckered into a silent scream.) Still, for a movie that's morally tilted toward the virtues of shacking up and settling down, The Last Kiss  takes a dreary view of matrimony's uxorious pleasures. Maybe on the tender cusp of 30, marriage ought to look a little drab, but even Jenna's lovingly concerned parents (Danner and Tom Wilkinson ), who have earned the right to fly the flag for domestic bliss, are deep in you've-never-understood-me doo-doo of their own, and when Wilkinson finally ponies up with the inevitable voice of experience to his errant future son-in-law, the words don't measure up to the actor's customary skilled delivery. Haggis can write a good one-liner, but he has a bad habit of shouting at the audience, and what worked for the over-the-top hysteria that was Crash  feels like too much information, too loudly offered in a putative chamber piece.
As for Braff, on whose performance the movie's drama and its comedy depend, he has schleppy charm to burn but no range whatsoever. Like many actors who come out of television comedy, he can't stop wooing the audience for a smile and a tearor worse, both at once. Michael is a thin variant of Braff's comatose TV actor in Garden State , who grows all too clearly out of his luckless schlemiel of an intern on Scrubs  . How to build a movie out of someone whose idea of self-redemption is squatting on his beloved's porch in the rain? The only person who's having anything resembling a good time in the whole forlorn caper is Kenny, and he adds up to not much more than an unusually active pair of bare buttocks. The Last Kiss  isn't terrible, but if you're strapped for a night out it can easily wait till DVD. Better yet, it may be time to revisit Diner .
