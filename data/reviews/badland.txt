 “Badland,” a melodrama by the writer and director Francesco Lucente, stands apart from the recent throng of post-9/11 dramas by posing a burning question we haven’t heard yet: Can a mentally ill Iraq war veteran who murdered his pregnant wife and two of his children learn how to love again?  Independent in scale but aggressively Hollywood in storytelling, this overlong,  mawkish yet weirdly mesmerizing film doesn’t just invite identification with its tragically unhinged character; it compels it, by piling on biblically horrible misfortunes, weepy confessions and editorializing music. (The soundtrack includes earnest pop songs by Bruce Springsteen, Ray LaMontagne and the supporting actor Joe Morton, as well as a hysterically overblown  score by Ludek Drizhal that could be titled “Ennio Morricone’s Viking Funeral.”)  The film’s small-town Marine reservist hero, Jerry (the English actor Jamie Draven, who played the older brother in “Billy Elliot”), is a guilt-wracked veteran of both Persian Gulf wars who suffers night terrors and nosebleeds. His boss at the general store baselessly fires him for stealing. His wife, Nora (Vinessa Shaw), is a hateful, thieving shrew who responds to his agonized weeping by telling him to  be a man. Talk about a quickie divorce: he blows her brains out at the breakfast table.  Jerry takes his 10-year-old daughter, Celina (Grace Fulton),  to a new town, where they move into a cheap motel room that he forbids Celina to leave. He then improbably lands a job as a short-order cook  for an angelic, blond, smokin’-hot coffee-shop owner named Oli (Chandra West).  Oli soon invites the newcomers into her house and Jerry into her bedroom, and urges Jerry to befriend an  alcoholic fellow veteran, Max (Mr. Morton), who turns out to be the local sheriff. Keep your head down, soldier boy.  Three factors mitigate the film’s tone-deaf road-to-redemption clichés. One is Mr. Draven, who badly botches Jerry’s American accent but powerfully communicates the guilt, fear and shame that are eating his guts out. Another is the sense that what we’re seeing onscreen isn’t “real” but the hero’s self-justifying projection of his miserable life — a suspicion confirmed in a coda that appears so late that it feels as  if the movie is copping out on its doom-spiral narrative.  The third redeeming feature is Mr. Lucente’s primitivist sensibility, the likes of which hasn’t been seen since Sam Fuller went to that great tabloid archive in the sky. This is the kind of film that communicates the idea of innocence by having  Celina dote on a doll, skip everywhere and stridently announce that her prayers will bring her mom and brothers back.  The film, unfortunately, has nothing in common with Terrence Malick’s 1973 classic “Badlands” except the title, a fugitive story line and a fascination with lonely landscapes, elegantly framed by the cinematographer Carlo Varini.  “Badland” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and graphic violence.

It�s a long and winding road for a depressed, distressed Iraq war vet in �Badland,� a strenuously solemn film that wants to create some kind of American pastoral tragedy out of the nation�s current angst with the war. But whatever dramatic values are mined by writer-director-editor Francesco Lucente evaporate during an unconscionable running time of two hours and 45 minutes. Given the length and the sorry commercial track record of war-related films this year, the pic is certain B.O. cannon fodder, with the only hope that inattentive vid renters will confuse it with Terrence Malick�s �Badlands.�
Like Malick�s astonishing debut, Lucente�s film tracks an unhinged young fugitive driving across American pasture land with a naive younger girl. There the similarities end, as �Badland� contains no poetry or greater awareness of its sad characters, even after spending so much time with them. Every scene in the film could have been trimmed, resulting in a compact and possibly more affecting work that would run perhaps shorter than 90 minutes. Instead, the pic leaves the bizarre impression that it simply doesn�t want to end, rather than delivering a gut punch. 
After a sudden opener that plays like a slideshow of scenes from the Iraq war, the film proper unfolds in a forlorn and nameless Wyoming town right out of a Richard Ford short story, where glum-faced Jerry (Jamie Draven), back from a long military stint that ended with a dishonorable discharge, holds down a nothing job at a gas station. Jerry looks ready to explode or fall asleep, and Draven�s performance never clarifies which. 
Wrongly accused of stealing gas by his lousy boss (Patrick Richards), Jerry also gets it at home from Nora (Vinessa Shaw), who seems to be vying for the title of Wife From Hell. Living in a trailer amid acreage strewn with junk would make anyone depressed, but Nora is so foul-mouthed, relentlessly nasty and henpecking that some auds may cheer when Jerry takes violent action.
Jerry ends up on the run with his loving little daughter, Celina (Grace Fulton). Through it all -- including a brief stay at an abandoned house and, finally, a stop in a small town -- Celina remains unfazed by the horrors she�s witnessed. It�s a badly conceived role that seems wrong to impose on a thesp as young as Fulton.
�Badland� futilely alternates between an air of unreality and hard facts. While it defies credibility that Jerry would land in a new town and effortlessly get a job as a short-order cook (despite blanketing media coverage), it rings true when he bonds, then clashes with fellow Iraq vet Max (Joe Morton).
Draven and Morton share the screen for the second half through several excessively long sequences, speeches and exchanges that at first appear promising, but descend into bathos. The raw material would seem to be in place for a strong, moving contemporary tragedy, but scene after endless scene fails to come to life.
Lucente and cinematographer Carlo Varini are clearly fascinated with vast Western landscapes (Alberta subbing for Wyoming), but their love of magic-hour light becomes repetitive and merely pictorial. Composer Ludek Drizhal�s score is serious, symphonic and even operatic, but -- true to the movie -- it never stops. 


Barely a ripple in this year's wave of returning Iraq  Warveteran dramas (Home of the Brave , In the Valley of Elah , et al.), writer-director Francesco Lucente 's overconfident, emotionally forced 160-minute opus offers trite antiwar platitudesat bestin chronicling the anguished existence of a soldier who can't shake the horrors he experienced in Fallujah . After being framed for theft at work, and then discovering that his cruel trailer-trash wife has been stealing from him, disgraced Marine reservist Jerry (Jamie Draven ) snaps, shooting the spouse and his two young sons before stopping just shy of killing both his daughter and himself. Now experiencing her own PTSD, precious little Celina (Grace Fulton) has put all her stock in God to bring back Mommy as the two go on the lam and settle in a fresh town. Incessantly scored with the most lachrymose flourishes, and shot almost entirely during magic hour (patting itself on the back with each landscape pan), Badland  practically begs "For Your Consideration" without the substance to justify its awards-season epic length. Big Statements come in burstsfrom a TV news reporter offering an out-of-left-field lesson on the My Lai massacre, to a drunken monologue by Joe Morton 's traumatized veteran turned sheriff. What sticks in the memory, though, is the ending: a cheap shot as shameful as Redacted 's, and, if you can believe it, even less nuanced.
