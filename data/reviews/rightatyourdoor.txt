If nothing else, Right at Your Door
 will make you painfully aware of just how permeable your home, and by extension your entire life, really is. No amount of plastic sheeting and duct tape can salvage anything but the most meager and pathetic shreds of normalcy from catastrophic upheavals, as the young, hip Los Angeles couple Lexi (McCormack) and Brad (Cochrane) discover by degrees. Although unemployed musician Brad is safe at home when a quartet of dirty bombs wreak havoc during L.A.'s morning rush hour, Lexi is on her way to work; she's on the freeway, near a blast site, and unreachable by her spouse's increasingly frantic phone calls. After an aborted rescue attempt (during which he catches the chilling sight of biohazard-suited cops gunning down innocent, "infected" citizens), Brad hunkers down at home. With the help of the neighbor's handyman (Perez), Brad follows the emergency-broadcast procedures and seals up the couple's house. And then Lexi shows up, obviously contaminated, on the other side of Brad's makeshift airlock. What's a guy to do? "Harrowing" doesn't even begin to describe this low-budget exercise in siege paranoia, which cunningly riffs on everything from George Romero's Night of the Living Dead
 and The Crazies
 to our current terrorist-related night-sweats. Cochrane and McCormack are riveting as the film's everycouple faced with impossible choices on the worst day of their lives. With its manic, handheld camerawork and incessant, jittery pacing, Right at Your Door
 recalls the recent Cavite
 (which also deals with the grim, nail-biting aspects of terror on the human psyche), and it succeeds despite a bizarre, third-act plot twist that seems to have come straight from The Twilight Zone
. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it does stretch viewer credulity to the near-breaking point. Still, this is frightening stuff, ably helmed (by writer/director Gorak, art director on the nerve janglers Fight Club
 and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas
), viciously acted, and altogether horrific in ways George A. Romero could imagine only through the lens of the darkest sort of fantasy.


"Right at Your Door" takes a potential and horrific real-world scenario -- a terrorist-launched dirty bomb spewing a toxic cloud over greater Los Angeles -- and bit by bit trivializes it into a "Twilight Zone" episode. Neat trick, but it's hardly the intended one. Written and directed by Chris Gorak, the film is low budget but puffed with self-importance, and it offers proof that Hollywood filmmakers should probably steer clear of topics that actually matter.
At first, the movie works up a fair amount of suspense for a one-set wonder. Unemployed musician Brad (Rory Cochrane) rises one sunny LA morning and sends his wife, Lexi (Mary McCormack), off to work; several minutes later, the radio begins emergency-broadcasting reports of detonations downtown. Rushing outside, Brad sees plumes of smoke rising from office buildings miles away, and the special effects are realistic enough to press that old 9/11 dread-button all over again.
The camerawork is hand-held, panicky; half-heard radio broadcasts stand in for soundtrack music. Trying to drive to wherever his wife may be, Brad is pushed back to his house as news of deadly fumes comes in. With the help of his neighbor's handyman (Tony Perez), he duct-tapes doors and windows shut just as the rain of ash begins to fall.
That's when Lexi arrives. And that's when "Right at Your Door" starts to fall apart, because the jittery husband refuses to let his wife inside, afraid she'll contaminate him. This barely makes sense on the movie's own terms -- not to mention any genuine human emotional ones -- but it does let Brad and Lexi chew over their relationship problems through thin plastic sheeting.
Filmmaker Gorak signals "realism" by having his characters use the f-word twice every f'ing sentence, and he obviously thinks he's on to something important here. What's the message, though? Love the one you're with, even if she's radioactive and you can't get near her? Keep food and fresh water in the basement at all times? Read the newspaper more often? It's a little late for that.
"Right at Your Door" exploits your and my daily code-orange anxieties for faux-topical thrills and a cheap twist ending that doesn't even scan. All that keeps the film watchable is Cochrane's shredded-cuticle performance as Brad; the actor who was once Slater the stoner in "Dazed and Confused" fearlessly portrays a terrorism survivor as a self-absorbed and indecisive "nice guy."
The apocalypse movie you're looking for is probably Michael Haneke's 2003 "Time of the Wolf," in which society falls apart in ways that feel awful and real. But maybe this is
 how the world ends in LA -- not with a bang but a 96-minute whimper.



         The ongoing attractiveness of our metropolis as a disaster mecca for filmmakers reaches a draggy low with the hysteria-steeped indie "Right at Your Door." Only this time, the focus isn't on the Jack Bauers of the world, but on one childless couple whose home is perilously close to the site of a dirty bomb attack that hits downtown L.A. (not to mention Beverly Hills and LAX) and starts blanketing the sky with a mysterious toxic ash. Jobless Brad (Rory Cochrane) openly fears for the whereabouts of his working wife Lexi (Mary McCormack) as he seals himself inside their house, then refuses to let her in when she shows up alive, afraid and -- oops -- coughing. With this annoying bit of false conflict -- who denies a loved one entry on the day of the apocalypse? -- first-time writer/director Chris Gorak keeps a tight camera on his leads as they worry, yell and cry at each other through duct-taped plastic sheets while radio voices bleat vague distress details. We never hear news reporting, though, on what the germ's spread is actually doing to civilians, since that would undermine the lame, bluntly moralizing shocker Gorak has planned for the end. A dumb twist can be excused, however, if your characters keep the thing afloat, which makes perhaps the most unforgivable sin of this claustrophobic terror scenario the fact that we have to spend it with arguably the two least interesting people in Los Angeles.

 MPAA rating: R for pervasive language and some disturbing violent content. Running time: 1 hour, 36 minutes. In selected theaters.

There are no zombies to distract from the plausibility of Right at Your Door . And that's what makes this smart, coolly horrifying American indie thriller one of the scariest movies you're likely to see all year  a post-9/11 nightmare about terrorism, panic, and paranoia with real, waking-life implications. The time is now, the setting is the nothing-special new home of a young married couple in the hills of Los Angeles, where Lexi (Mary McCormack), a corporate type, kisses her stay-at-home musician husband, Brad (Rory Cochrane), goodbye and joins the city's commuting thousands. She forgot to charge her cell phone? Ah, well, who hasn't from time to time?
Then, in probable places like Beverly Hills, downtown, LAX, dirty bombs go off  those insidious weapons of destruction we now know to fear, localized but lingering in toxicity as chemical death travels through the ashy air. Lexi is out there and incommunicado; Brad is at home, frantic and thwarted from searching for his wife by the cops barring civilians from the roads. Eventually he follows emergency-broadcast instructions to seal himself inside and avoid contact with anyone exposed to the dirty dust. But then Lexi does show up, coughing and vomiting. And choices have to be made. What would you  do?
Chris Gorak, making a smashing writing and directing debut, has established his career as a production designer (Lords of Dogtown ) and art director (Minority Report , Fight Club ), and his eye for the vulnerabilities (and dramatic uses) of everyday existence is exceptional. Because Brad and Lexi haven't yet hooked up their cable, the only news is aural, not visual, allowing viewer imagination to mix with toxic fears. There's bottled water in the kitchen but not much, because, really, who follows the media admonishments to be ready for anything? The camera focus is tight, close, the action mostly confined to the house. But in one nerve-racking sequence soon after the blasts, Brad's panicky attempt to drive toward his wife on local streets is shot from a car's-eye view  the lurches and reverses, the peripheral sight of other citizens scrambling for their own safety in a new world where duct tape is precious as gold.
A corrective for 24  and its blowhardism, Right at Your Door  doesn't waste time fulminating about who organized such effective terrorism, or why. Instead, Gorak keeps his inquiries intimate, and as a result, painfully identifiable. In the immediate information vacuum (and before the cloud of death dust blows north), Brad has to decide whether to give refuge to a handyman (Tony Perez) locked out of the house next door. In the long hours and even days that follow, as martial law is declared, Lexi and Brad have to consider a future denied. The story becomes more sinister (and movielike) as disinformation does its own damage, but the truth contained within this powerful fiction is very much at our door.

 Anyone who was in New York on 9/11 will certainly be creeped out by some of the shots in “Right at Your Door,” a doomsday-style film by Chris Gorak with a twist worth waiting for. Explosions, presumably engineered by terrorists, leave Los Angeles in a toxic haze, and the long shots of the downtown area shrouded in smoke will bring back all sorts of memories.  But this is no big-budget disaster film. We see the effects of the attack on one household, where Brad (Rory Cochrane) is safe at home when the blasts occur but his wife, Lexi (Mary McCormack), is caught in the virus-laced ash on her way to work. The third star of the film is duct tape: Brad seals up as instructed by the radio and then must make a decision when the contagious Lexi returns home.  The film, especially in its resolution, feels a bit like a “Twilight Zone” episode and might have been better at that length, but the acting’s pretty good, and the cinematography keeps things lively.  “Right at Your Door” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for a lot of the same words you would probably say if you were sprinkled with lethal fallout.

A wannabe heart-stopper about a multiple dirty bomb attack on Los Angeles, "Right at Your Door" serves to illustrate why disaster movies have always featured large casts and big stars; in this genre, less is less. Low-budget directorial debut by the visually resourceful art director of "Minority Report" and "Fight Club," Chris Gorak, grabs the viewer by the throat in the first few minutes, but quickly fritters away involvement by concentrating almost exclusively on two characters who are both annoying and boring. Commercial chances are dicey.
It would seem an easy matter to play on public paranoia about large-scale domestic terrorist attacks by creating a premise as plausible as the one Gorak formulates here: On a weekday morning, bombs detonate in downtown Los Angeles, Beverly Hills and at LAX, creating widespread paralysis and chaos.
Shortly thereafter, billowing clouds fill the air and toxic ash begins falling like soft snow. Everyone who's inside is instructed to seal up their residences, while those already exposed are ordered to remain outside so as not to contaminate others. 
All of this is seen from the point of view of Brad (Rory Cochrane), a scruffy, out-of-work musician who lives in a modest house in the hills of the Silver Lake area, which affords a clear view of the destruction wrought downtown, where his live-in g.f., professional woman Lexi (Mary McCormack), works. In a panic, and unable to get through by phone, Brad drives off to find her, only to be cut off by police at every turn.
An ambitious sound mix of intermittent radio reports, phone calls, ambient noise and techno scoring by tomandandy provides information and atmosphere, but once the story settles down from the alarming opening, one becomes trapped with the singularly unappetizing character of Brad, who's joined back at his house for a while by a handyman (Tony Perez) from next door. 
Eventually, Lexi makes her way home, but she is forced to remain outside. So the couple talks through a clear plastic sheet, she mostly in a hysterical vein and he offering up bland optimism, and both using the f-word so often you'd think David Mamet took a pass at the script (one could wish).
Gorak is clearly striving to create a microcosm of the city's dilemma through the pressure cooker of Brad and Lexi's predicament, but the attempt at unrelieved "intensity" becomes intensely off-putting in its unvarying obviousness. Leads are simultaneously so on-topic in their dialogue and so inarticulate that you crave seeing how other people are coping with the catastrophe. Cochrane and McCormack, who have been very good in previous roles, can't provide any subtext or connection to their unimaginative characters.
Going out of his way to avoid sentimentality by not saddling the couple with kids or even a pet, the writer-director briefly brings in a little black boy who can't find his parents, but then does nothing with him. Ironic ending is a shoulder-shrugger.
Technically, film is adept. Gorak and lenser Tom Richmond have worked out a cool visual palette of grays and blues, and discreet handheld camerawork generally stays in tight on its subjects. The sporadic visual-effects shots of bombed downtown, just a few miles away from the couple's home location, are completely credible, as are the more frequent glimpses of the increasing buildup of ash.

Citizens of Los Angeles: You are screwed. Three "dirty" bombs have gone off around the city, and from his home near Dodger Stadium , Brad (Rory Cochrane ) is frantically trying to phone his wife, Lexi (Mary McCormack ). After failing to reach her, Brad follows the advice of frantic radio announcers and seals every crevice and cranny of the house, so that no toxin-loaded airor toxin-loaded humancan get inside. Just then, of course, a coughing Lexi shows up, demanding entrance. As setups go, this one, devised by art director (Minority Report ) turned writer-director Chris Gorak , is terribly precious, and in a less threatening age might have been an easy one to shrug off, like one of those old Twilight Zone morality plays about the end of the world. Many still will, but Right At Your Door is grounded hard by some terrific smoking-skyline special effects and by Cochrane and McCormack's intensity. They're impressively unsentimental, even as tears stream down their faces for most of the movie. Secondary charactersa lost neighborhood child and an equally lost gardenerring less true, and feel like wan attempts to pad the plot. The ending, by the way, is ridiculous (let's hope), yet totally unnerving.
