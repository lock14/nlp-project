‘New York, I Love You’’ wants us to know that the city is a sexy, romantic, thrillingly random place where anything can go down. Sadly, two of those things are your eyelids.
The diverse assortment of talented men and women who’ve been dispatched to write and direct segments of this desultory project return with news of wise young hookers and cranky old Jews, stalkers and loners, virgins, painters, and Shia LaBeouf with a watery Russian accent. Every tale contorts into a punch line, none of which is as surprising or moving as the filmmakers assume.
The movie begins with a “Hey, I was here first’’ cab ride. Entering on the left is Bradley Cooper and on the right, Justin Bartha. They just played buddies in “The Hangover.’’ Now they’re strangers. But the recognition in Cooper’s eyes makes the whole encounter feel like a stunt. It also sets a tone of pointlessness. Not much later, there’s Julie Christie and  LaBeouf in an episode directed by Shekhar Kapur (who made both “Elizabeth’’ movies) and written by the late Anthony Minghella, to whom the entire film has been dedicated. Christie and LaBeouf interact in a large white hotel room. He’s the limping Russian bellhop; she’s just her ethereal self. He does all the work and most of the talking. Until he makes a dramatic exit, she rightly ignores him.
Just in the last 10 years, New York has received more exuberant valentines from the horny, besotted, and fake-ID-wielding (“200 Cigarettes’’ and “Nick and Nora’s Infinite Playlist’’ are two that come to mind). This collection also places a premium on kids  - Natalie Portman, Christina Ricci, Hayden Christensen, Anton Yelchin, Olivia Thirlby, Eva Amurri, Shu Qi, Rachel Bilson, and Orlando Bloom also show up. But it feels like a business imperative: “We need to sell this thing, OK?’’ This would barely be worth mentioning except that the movie, while populated with exciting young people, misses the natural kick of youth.
Representing the other side of 35, Robin Wright Penn tries to pick up Chris Cooper outside a bar, and it might have been even sexier had we not seen a charmingly overcaffeinated Ethan Hawke do the same to Maggie Q 30 minutes earlier. He’s 38 now and is easily the most vibrant thing in the movie.
There are no gays or people of color who don’t drive a taxi, sell their bodies, or provide a service of some kind. The entry that Portman directs, about a little blond girl and her Brazilian caretaker, highlights the movie’s blind spot by trying to trick us into seeing a racial and socio-economic problem where ultimately none exists.
The assorted directors here include Mira Nair, an Indian who lives in New York; Fatih Akin, a German of Turkish stock; Allen Hughes, an Armenian- and African-American who grew up in Detroit; Joshua Marston, an American whose first movie, “Maria Full of Grace,’’ gave us a Columbian drug mule on her way to the United States, and Yvan Attal, a Frenchman who on a bad day can turn romance into an episode of “Sesame Street.’’ How could so ethnically and artistically diverse a field of filmmakers produce a work of such lifeless uniformity?
This wasn’t so with the movie’s predecessor, “Paris, je t’aime,’’ which was imaginatively, if exhaustively, broken into discrete chapters in which the city’s neighborhoods set the mood. That was the Paris of the filmmakers’ whimsy  - trivial sometimes, touristy others, inspired, and artistic even in the weaker segments. This time the entire project has one editor and one cinematographer. If that ensures consistency, it also results in a homogenization of vision.
Aside from a sitcom-sweet excursion to Coney Island, a morose trip to Chinatown, and some embarrassingly dropped names (“Balthazar for dinner then  Pastis for dessert?’’ Gag.), it’s hard even to know where we are. If this is New York, I’d need the GPS coordinates to know for sure.

New York, I Love You  takes the wrinkle-free, easy-travel concept first executed in the 2007 Gallic compilation Paris, je t'aime  to a new city and styles itself like a themed issue of The New York Times Magazine . Here, a procession of hip filmmakers (from Allen Hughes to Shekhar Kapur) present intertwined vignettes about love, romance, and/or sex, all starring hip   actors (from Ethan Hawke to Julie Christie), each set in a hip neighborhood (from Soho to the Upper West Side, with one outer- borough stop in Brighton Beach).
In this rarefied NYC, every street is beautiful no matter how chaotic (Fatih Akin directs in Chinatown), and every body is beautiful no matter how frail (Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman steal the show as old Brooklynites). Tourists may notice that the film's New Yorkers are all straight, and mostly white. But they'll want to sightsee, especially when Bradley Cooper hooks up with Drea de Matteo, Chris Cooper and Robin Wright Penn flirt madly, and, in Brett Ratner's nicely raunchy sketch, Anton Yelchin gets lucky with a wheelchair-bound Olivia Thirlby. These tales are as highly designed as fashion layouts. But they're as relaxing to thumb through as those NYT Magazine  trend pieces about how chopsticks are the new forks, or how Eva Amurri is the new Christina Ricci  both of whom also   wander through this Gotham travelogue.


 “New York, I Love You” is the second installment in a franchise of urban anthology films that began in Paris and is scheduled to touch down soon in Rio, Shanghai, Mumbai and Jerusalem. My own sentimental heart is holding out for Dayton, Ohio. Eventually, like a cinematic version of Google Earth, these movies, the brainchild of the producer Emmanuel Benbihy, will cover every inch of the globe with big-name actors and tiny romantic epiphanies. It may not be a project that will make the world smaller or friendlier — only, perhaps, a bit more precious.  Not that the 11 shorts in “New York, I Love You” are all that bad. It’s a nice-looking city, after all, even if the interstitial skyline and traffic montages assembled by Randy Balsmeyer are about as fresh as the postcards on sale in Times Square. Each vignette was shot in two days, and the roster of directing talent includes Mira Nair (“The Namesake” and the forthcoming “Amelia”), Fatih Akin (“Head-On” and “The Edge  of Heaven”) and Natalie Portman, making her debut behind the camera. (She also plays a Hasidic diamond broker in Ms. Nair’s contribution.)  But in spite of some attempts at human and neighborhood variety, the stories have a  self-conscious sameness, as if they were classroom assignments in an undergraduate fiction-writing class. Which, in a way, they are. Each filmmaker seems to have staked out a different part of town, though only one, Joshua Marston (“Maria Full of Grace”), has ventured beyond the tourist-friendly precincts of Manhattan. Apparently nobody loves Queens, the Bronx or Staten Island. Or Harlem, for that matter. And while the ideas of love explored on the East and West Sides are sometimes platonic, parental or intergenerational, they are also predominantly white and heterosexual.  Nobody should expect the directors, a pointedly non-hometown team — other notable names include Yvan Attal from France, and Jiang Wen from China — to plumb the depths or mine the grit of the real New York. They have, instead, composed a flurry of valentines to a fantasy version of the city, one culled from other movies and also from literature. You might get a hint of Martin Scorsese or Woody Allen here and there, but just as pronounced are the inflections of J. D. Salinger, Paul Auster, O. Henry and many decades’ worth of contributors to the Talk of the Town section of The New Yorker.  All of which might be tolerable in small doses, but somehow, once they are stitched together, the pieces of “New York, I Love You” make up a parallel city that no one would want to live in, much less visit. And this is in part because most of the New Yorkers on display here are confections, hothouse flowers planted in a soil of arch dialogue and watered with studied sprinklings of surprise.  These people have a funny — actually a tiresome  —  habit of not being what they seem, at first, to be. Thus the young man (Anton Yelchin) in Brett Ratner’s prom-night anecdote (in which, by the way, no cars burst into flames) allows himself to be fixed up with the daughter of an avuncular pharmacist (James Caan). The girl is played by the charming Olivia Thirlby, and a morsel of drama is produced by her date’s discovery that she uses a wheelchair.  That situation plays out more like a smutty shaggy-dog story than a sweet slice of life, but Mr. Ratner and Jeff Nathanson, who wrote this section, seem to be working, in their literal-minded way, from the same template as other, more overtly poetic contributors. Chance meetings have a way of yielding  reversals that seem as diagrammed as chess moves. Men in particular — a young thief (Hayden Christensen), an obnoxious pick-up artist (Ethan Hawke), a middle-aged businessman (Chris Cooper) — receive comeuppances that only they fail to anticipate. The women who supply them (including Robin Wright Penn and Maggie Q) tend to be savvier and more enigmatic, but no less limited.  It’s somewhat surprising how plot driven, how shaped, the chapters in “New York, I Love You” seem, given the current vogue for open-ended, observational cinema about city life. I’m thinking of younger American directors like Andrew Bujalski and Barry Jenkins (whose “Medicine for Melancholy” could just as well have been called “San Francisco, I Love You”) and also of the filmmakers who have brought cities like Taipei, Tehran, Bucharest and Buenos Aires to rough and vivid life over the past decade.  New York, like Paris and Los Angeles, is both overexposed and underexplored in movies, and of the love letters assembled here only two linger in the mind after this 110-minute speed-dating session is over: Ms. Nair’s diamond-district encounter (with Irrfan Khan as well as Ms. Portman), and Allen Hughes’s impressionistic study of the anxious aftermath of a one-night stand, starring Bradley Cooper and Drea de Matteo. Otherwise you would glimpse more interesting stories, and more arresting images, on a twilight cab ride across the East River.  “New York, I Love You”  is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There are 11 stories in the naked city, and in some of them people get naked.

The "Cities of Love" franchise begun with "Paris, je t'aime" discards originality for uniformity in its disappointing second installment, "New York, I Love You." Ten helmers were given a formula for shooting a Gotham-based love story: Lensing had to last no more than two days and editing just one week, connected by transitions shot by one more director. The results are, well, formulaic, hobbled by weak dialogue and absent any sense of texture. The city itself comes off characterless and blandly gentrified, making the Oct. 16 Vivendi Entertainment release unlikely to catch on with targeted romantic arthouse sophisticates.
Whether it can appeal to the multiplex set will depend entirely on marketers pulling in crowds who don't see much difference between Las Vegas' "New York New York" and the real thing. In particular, Gothamites will wonder what happened to their city, devoid of grit, and where African-Americans are mere extras and Hispanics apparently nonexistent. Producer Emmanuel Benbihy (who also produced "Paris, je t'aime" and is credited with the feature-film concept here) presumably favored quick turnarounds because they're cheaper and foster an off-the-cuff urgency, but the talented directors assembled here seem to have felt uninspired or apathetic.
Segments last around eight minutes each, and none are titled, in keeping with Benbihy's stated goal of avoiding the sense of a collection of shorts. Despite the push for giving it all a feature feel (Scarlett Johansson's directorial debut, shot in black-and-white, was cut because it didn't conform to the overall look), there's no getting around the fact that this is indeed a collection of shorts, which in itself wouldn't be a bad thing if the components were more incisive.
Some segments do hold up nicely: Mira Nair's entry stars Natalie Portman as a Chassidic woman in the Diamond District whose strictly business relationship with a Jain gem merchant (Irrfan Khan) takes a surprising turn. While several of the films deal with cross-cultural meetings and clashes, Nair avoids the expected and invests her entry with real emotional tenderness.
Completely different, and working well because of it, is Brett Ratner's segment about a high schooler (Anton Yelchin) suckered by a pharmacist (James Caan) into taking his wheelchair-bound daughter (Olivia Thirlby) to the prom. Again, expectation is upended, and there's a piquant sense of humor to the piece, though the voiceover is unnecessary.
Unanticipated relationships similarly inform the episodes directed by Jiang Wen and Yvan Attal, but they lack the tight punchiness needed for such quick work. In Jiang's piece, thief Hayden Christensen pickpockets Andy Garcia, only to fall for Garcia's mistress (Rachel Bilson). Attal's entry consists of two encounters, one involving fast-talker Ethan Hawke trying to pick up a coolly amused Maggie Q (one of the few thesps to make an impression), the other featuring an intense come-on between Chris Cooper and Robin Wright Penn.
Orlando Bloom is a musician on a tight deadline in Shunji Iwai's segment, an OK entry made pleasant by the enticingly sweet voice of Christina Ricci as the largely unseen woman encouraging him on the phone. Darkest of the shorts is Allen Hughes' entry, starring Drea De Matteo as a woman trying to understand why she had a one-night stand with a younger guy (Bradley Cooper), and why she wants to see him again. De Matteo rises above the material, though the flashback sex scene feels gratuitous rather than urgent.
Portman directs a wispy short about a little girl (Taylor Geare) whose male nanny (Carlos Acosta) is uncomfortable being seen as merely a child-care provider. More substantial is Fatih Akin's piece, starring Turkish thesp Ugur Yucel as an artist obsessed with a woman (Shu Qi, so it's understandable) in Chinatown. Though the segment works, it feels cut out from something bigger, and as with all the other shorts, even Akin's corner of Gotham has no extratextual role.
Oddest of all is the short helmed by Shekhar Kapur, who took over for the late Anthony Minghella (who scripted the episode, and to whom the entire pic is dedicated). Julie Christie plays an opera singer who checks into an elegant hotel (shot as if it's somewhere in heaven) to kill herself. She's intrigued by a handicapped bellboy (Shia LaBeouf, his accent slipping into unknown regions) who magically becomes associated with John Hurt. Meant to convey feelings of wistfulness and yearning, the piece merely feels ill thought-out, despite Christie's best efforts.
The sole short not set in Manhattan belongs to Joshua Marston, who sets Eli Wallach and Cloris Leachman on Coney Island; their standard old-couple shtick is redeemed by the sheer pleasure of watching these two pros radiate more personality than the dialogue provides.
It's too much to expect the kind of New Yorkese wit spouted by Woody Allen characters in their prime, and Benbihy's decision to hire non-Gotham helmers could have been a bold move, but the compendium's greatest flaw is its overall homogeneous feel. Emilie Ohana, cast as a video artist casually shooting the life around her, is meant to be the connecting feature in the transitional scenes (helmed by Randy Balsmeyer), but she's simply an empty, smiling shell, sweetly observing but never entering into the life of the film.
Perhaps because of the time constraints, tech creds are solid but featureless; lighting is especially uninspired. Music is meant to reflect the Big Apple's multicultural mix, but none of it feels like New York.

Billed as a "collective feature film," New York, I Love You  is the second in the "Cities of Love" series, an idea that has so far proved better in theory than execution. As with its predecessor, Paris je t'aime , there are hits and misses. Producer Emmanuel Benbihy decreed that each of the 11 segments be set in a specific neighborhood, but only a few manage to capture the spirit of their surroundings. The duds, like Jiang Wen 's pickpocket three-way with Hayden Christensen , Andy Garcia , and Rachel Bilson , and Mira Nair 's corny collision between Natalie Portman  and Irrfan Khan , have a canned, flattened quality that drags the collective down. Orlando Bloom  has some fun with the lonely freelance life, greasing up to play a composer-for-hire with an impossible client, and Ethan Hawke  and Maggie Q  reimagine the dynamic of the street-corner pick-up. But the most effective entries—by Allen Hughes  (Bradley Cooper  and Drea de Matteo  navigate their found chemistry), Fatih Akin  (Ugur Yücel and Shu Qi  reach out, but can't quite connect), and Joshua Marston  (Eli Wallach  and Cloris Leachman  shuffle off to Coney Island )—bring both bitter and sweet to their snapshots of this city's most cherished and elusive quality: intimacy.
