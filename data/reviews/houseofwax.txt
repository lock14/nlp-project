Imagine for a moment that you�re a sick little puppy and you want to see Paris Hilton die. Or perform a striptease in a tent. Or both. Technically, the rules of my profession prohibit me from confirming whether these events occur in this slick, n�-metallic remake of Andr� de Toth�s titular 1953 creepshow, but gee whiz � if you had Hilton in your movie, what would you do with her? Ophelia�s mad scene? Anyway, amidst the crunching chords of Disturbed and product placement for InStyle
, a certain high-profile hotel heiress becomes stranded in the Florida hinterlands with her Central Casting buddies (the tough kid, the dopey kid, the sweet lovable boyfriend, and Cuthbert as the good girl), and it takes forever
 for them to fall into the clutches of demented rednecks (Van Holt, a sort of Bill Paxtonesque fellow in a dual role) and be tormented with duct tape, pliers, shotguns, sharpened sticks, and all manner of weapons. The locus of the action is Trudy�s House of Wax, a waxworks so � well � waxy
 that the house itself is made of wax. To explain the presence of this marvel, there�s some expository business about a closed sugar mill and a newly constructed highway, and conjoined twins and a brain cyst, and a town so small and woebegone that even the sheriff can�t find it. Of course its composition engenders plenty of nifty special effects from the deep pockets of co-producers Robert Zemeckis and Joel Silver, and there are some pleasures to be had from that. Occasionally the movie (directed by the music video artist formerly known as Jaume, in his feature debut) manages to be genuinely creepy � not just suspenseful, but truly unsettling. There�s one set-piece in particular � the details of which I cannot reveal, but let�s say it involves a sweet, lovable boyfriend and a certain quantity of wax � that could really freak a person right the fuck out. Collet-Serra sets up the sequence with deliberate care and drags it out to the point of sadism, perhaps beyond. A certain type of viewer � the sick little puppy kind � should appreciate this moment, and it is undeniably effective. Otherwise, expect lots of Slasher Movie 101 and putatively clever jibes at a certain high-profile hotel heiress (involving a video camera, of course, and a box full of cell phones that don�t work).


Celebutante Paris Hilton, whose cinematic experience includes her infamous sex tape, can now add horror-film victim to her resume. For Hilton haters, the stupid and grotesque remake of ''House of Wax" will only stoke their schadenfreude. One clothing store in Los Angeles built a ''House of Wax" window display that included the film's opening date and the line ''See Paris die!" But Hilton lends the Warner Bros. movie both snob appeal and street cred.
Hilton plays Paige, an oversexed girl who wears plush sweat suits and seems generally bored, but comes alive to perform sex acts on her African-American boyfriend, Blake, played by Robert Ri'chard. (Mercifully, the film doesn't make an issue of their interracial relationship.)
Along with four other college kids, these two are on their way to Baton Rouge, La., for a big football game when the sporty car belonging to Wade (Jared Padalecki) suddenly needs a part replaced. He and his girlfriend Carly (Elisha Cuthbert) catch a ride with an uncouth backwoodsman to the edge of a deserted town where there's a big, scary museum called the House of Wax for them to meddle around. The two snoops also meet Bo (Brian Van Holt), a handsome local with an ominously unattractive accent.
Bo claims to be the town's mechanic and says he has the missing car part -- back at his house. For reasons that have more to do with brainless screenwriting than common sense, they accompany him there, only to be plunged into a nightmare in which slashing, impaling, raw flesh, Crazy Glue doubling as lip balm, and, yes, waxing are all on the menu. Apparently, Bo and his disfigured twin are always looking for new humans to boost the town's waxen population. Their procedure looks so painful that it makes a Brazilian wax seem like a massage.
While Carly and Wade do and say the obvious (Wade about the museum: ''It is
 wax, like, literally"), Carly's rebellious twin brother Nick (Chad Michael Murray) and his dim pal Dalton (Jon Abrahams) are looking for them. While they're doing that, Paige and Blake are trying to have sex in a tent, while Bo and his bro are on the loose with sharp objects.
Cuthbert might be annoyed that I've spent so much space going on about her more famous costar when she's the one who spends most of the film in a tank top and splattered with blood. Viewers of the television drama ''24" will remember Cuthbert as Jack Bauer's dumb daughter, Kim. The acting in ''House of Wax" ranges from bad to worse, but Cuthbert, while vaguely appealing, is guilty of looking like a wax-museum-version Kirsten Dunst without having much of Dunst's spunk or grit.
Written by Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes and directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, ''House of Wax" bears almost no resemblance to Andre de Toth's campy 1953 3-D mystery-chiller. It starred Vincent Price as a sculptor hellbent on rebuilding his collection of life-size wax figures with human cadavers after a fire destroys the originals.
In de Toth's film, Price's sculptor was nuts, but he was almost seductive about his obsession. In a backhanded tribute to Price, Bo's madman twin is named Vincent (also played by Van Holt), but the character is a mute who wears a blank wax mask that makes him a direct descendant of Leatherface from ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre." He's not a sculptor. He's a hack.
Collet-Serra's movie revels in viscera, gore, and entrails. But Stephen Windon's night-time photography and Graham Walker's art direction, particularly once the museum starts melting in the film's show-stopping finale, are triumphs of contemporary-art design over the gross and grossly illogical. Like the dreary remake of ''The Amityville Horror," the movie's real star is that house. Sorry, Paris.

         Related to the 1953 Vincent Price film in name, embalming technique and Warner Bros. pedigree only, the new "House of Wax" is a dreary, predictable tale of hormone-driven young people who take a shortcut off a Louisiana highway only to find themselves potential figures in a backwater Madame Tussaud's.
 
  Elisha Cuthbert and Chad Michael Murray are the nominal leads, playing twins (she's the good one, he's the bad seed) on a road trip to a Florida-LSU football game with four buddies — including Paris Hilton, who is required to do nothing beyond that for which she is already famous.
 


         






    After a promisingly ominous and disturbing prologue, first-time feature director Jaume-Collet Serra and the film settle into nearly 45 minutes devoid of anything besides wan attempts at character development and genre-ratified ploys to separate members of the group. The final hour-plus has more action but is as frightless as it is humorless, lacking even the camp elements bad horror usually provides, before a spectacularly ridiculous ending in which characters swim through rivers of molten wax without getting so much as a hot foot.

  Frustration: It's just part of the process
 
 
A curio created in the editing room, "Nobody Wants Your Film" is a genuinely original work that won't be for everyone but will certainly resonate with aspiring filmmakers and those interested in creating art in a world of commerce. Consisting of footage shot on the set of an independent film and e-mails stringing together a semifictionalized story line involving the difficulties of gaining distribution, the movie's strengths lie in revealing interviews with cast and crew members as well as surreal — at times beautiful — visuals.
 
  Director Peter Judson includes conversations with indie stalwarts such as Peter Dinklage and Sam Rockwell as well as more seasoned actors such as David Proval. Abstract but absorbing, the interviews vary from locker room jocularity to heartfelt expressions about craft and capture all the banality, frustration, passion and exuberance that go into making a movie. "Nobody Wants Your Film" is both the cautionary tale implied by its title and an inspiring note from the indie underground. The glory may lie in getting your film seen, but the struggle and the numerous rejections cannot negate the importance of doing the work.

House of Wax  is unusual for one reason only. Not counting the Paris Hilton sex tapes sold to all the Luddites who couldn't find it online, this is the first time you're actually being asked to pay to gape at the hotel-heiress swizzle stick who already pops up everywhere  TV shows, parties, and film festivals  at no cost. A few people would even pay $10 just to make her stay at home for an evening.
So it's hot when, just a few minutes into a mercenary horror remake about kids stumbling onto a fake town run by Achilles-tendon-slicing waxworkers, Hilton turns out to be a pleasant addition to the dead-meat cast (led by waxy Justin Timberlake and Kirsten Dunst look-alikes Murray and Cuthbert). Not because she gets murdered, but because scary movies thrive on a sense of play, and except for when Paris is on screen giving us the winking sex eye, Wax  is just a museum of gory, joyless, easy shocks.

ouse of Wax," the latest high-end frightener to be released by Warner Brothers under the Dark Castle label, begins with a creepy flashback to 1974. The date is fitting, because even though this movie is a loose remake - a "reimagining," in the words of its publicity material - of a 1953 horror classic starring Vincent Price, its more immediate sources of inspiration are the cheap, grisly and highly effective scare pictures of the 70's, a decade that saw the birth of the "Halloween" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" franchises. As in those movies, this updated "House of Wax" features a group of randy, quarreling young people who wander off the main road only to be dispatched one by one by a ruthless maniac. The set design is fairly elaborate by the standards of the genre, and the victims don't die in precisely the order you might expect, but everything else goes pretty much according to formula, including a last-minute plot twist that opens the creaky door to a sequel. In another slight departure from convention, there are apparently two maniacs (twin brothers), but even so it takes them nearly an hour of screen time to claim their first victim, which may make you wonder if the filmmakers mislaid their horror-movie instruction manual. Not to worry. After a few too many teasing false scares, and some obligatory ogling of Paris Hilton and Elisha Cuthbert, the screenwriters (Chad Hayes and Carey W. Hayes), the director (Jaume Collet-Serra) and the maniacs (both played by Brian Van Holt) settle down to their sadistic business. There is some pretty bloody stuff - decapitation, a severed finger, lips stuck together with high-powered glue, a snipped Achilles tendon - all of which is a prelude to an exquisitely icky method of murder. The victims, sometimes before they are dead, are covered in hot wax and then carefully made over into uncanny, motionless reproductions of themselves. The perpetrators of this horror - whose motives are hinted at in that opening flashback, and then spelled out at some length later on - deserve credit for ghoulish creativity, as does Jason Baird, who created the film's wax figures, though mainly out of silicone and fiberglass. The statues populate the town of Ambrose, a Louisiana hamlet that seems lost in time. There is an Art Deco movie house playing "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?," a gas station where regular sells for $1.19 a gallon, and a church where a funeral is always in progress. Somehow, even though none of the telephones work, and a Cadillac's G.P.S.  navigation can't locate the town, cellphone reception is crystal clear. The six hapless young folk stumble into Ambrose on their way to a football game, and in the midst of their own petty melodramas. Ms. Hilton is Paige, who is keeping a secret from her boyfriend, Blake (Robert Ri'chard). Ms. Cuthbert is Carly, the subject of a three-way rivalry among her dreamboat boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki); a dispensable doofus in a baseball cap named Dalton (Jon Abrahams); and her twin brother, Nick (Chad Michael Murray), who has just finished a spell in jail for auto theft. Carly and Nick's contrasting temperaments - he sardonically refers to himself as "the evil twin" - mirror the sibling dynamic of the killers, providing "House of Wax" with at least the hint of a psychological subtext. Mostly, though, it's the usual scary stuff - the sudden noises on the soundtrack, the shock cuts and camera tricks that never seem to grow old. You know exactly when you're going to be jolted, but you jump anyway and view the spurts of phony blood through the spaces between your fingers. What humor there is comes mainly at Ms. Hilton's expense; the movie sends up her two most famous roles so far, on the fish-out-of-water reality show "The Simple Life" and in that notorious Internet sex tape. A certain portion of the audience will no doubt buy tickets hoping to see her meet a gruesome end, which is a little mean spirited, given that she seems, in this movie at least, to be a pretty good sport, if not exactly a good actress. It would be a little too scary if she were. "House of Wax" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has blood, gore, teasing sexual references and strong language.

A Paris Hilton strip tease and some impressive special effects are the selling points of "House of Wax," an in-name-only remake of the 1953 Andre De Toth horror classic that reps the latest offering from Joel Silver's Dark Castle Entertainment. Direly predictable, with candle-drip pacing and a pervasive unpleasantness, pic arrives at a fortuitous moment given the box-office power of gory genre fare. But an R rating, the lack of an obvious "Amityville"-type hook and heavy opening-weekend competition from "Kingdom of Heaven" should keep business for "House" at the level of a solid, but unspectacular sideshow attraction.
While such earlier Dark Castle productions as "House on Haunted Hill" and "Thirteen Ghosts" drew on recognizable Hollywood character actors and embraced the pulpy, tongue-in-cheek spirit of the company's namesake -- horror impresario William Castle -- "House of Wax" makes a clear bid for the less discriminating teen and twentysomething crowd.
Two carloads of college students are traveling from Gainesville to Baton Rouge to attend a high-profile college football game. Ambitious Carly ("24" hottie Elisha Cuthbert) is already planning for her upcoming move to Manhattan, much to the dismay of her small-town boyfriend, Wade (Jared Padalecki).
Also along for the ride are Carly's friend Paige (Hilton), who hasn't yet told her African-American boyfriend, Blake (Robert Ri'chard), that she might be pregnant; wisecracking Dalton (the amusing Jon Abrahams); and Carly's delinquent twin brother, Nick ("One Tree Hill" hunk Chad Michael Murray), freshly paroled from prison.
When the trip takes longer than expected, merry sextet opts to camp out in a deserted field. Next morning, they discover their campsite is located next to a dumping ground for animal carcasses. (So that's 
where that smell was coming from!).Yet, when Wade discovers his car has a busted fan belt, nobody seems to consider it unwise for him to stay behind to fix it.
As the others journey on to the game (only to turn around after hitting a massive traffic jam), Wade and Carly hitch a ride into the nearby town of Ambrose, where they stumble upon the titular wax museum and its uncannily lifelike sculptures.
As viewers of the 1953 "House of Wax" (or, for that matter, its 1933 predecessor, "Mystery of the Wax Museum") already know, there's a reason for the eerie verisimilitude of the "statues," and the villains, a pair of separated-at-birth, Siamese-twin brothers (both played by Brian Van Holt) don't take too kindly to visitors.
Any similarity to earlier "Wax" pics ends there, with twin-brother screenwriters Chad and Carey Hayes and director Jaume Collet-Serra quickly descending into slasher-movie cliches.
The characters are about as intelligent as their waxen alter-egos, making it impossible to care too much about what happens to them. Amid flat, one-dimensional performances, Murray exhibits a live-wire intensity in a few scenes that suggests he may be one to watch.
In the pic's press notes, Collet-Serra, a successful musicvideo and commercials director making his feature debut, talks about his desire to create "an unstructured, almost documentary feel." Onscreen, this amounts to an inordinately long set-up -- nothing even remotely scary happens for the first two reels -- followed by a series of rote (if explicitly violent) murders thatare more a testament to the talent of the pic's makeup artists than Collet-Serra's directorial prowess.
By far the pic's most inspired idea is that the House of Wax is actually made of wax itself, along with every piece of furniture in it. That set -- and, indeed, the entire ghost town of Ambrose -- is brought to vivid life by ace production designer Graham "Grace" Walker.
But pic lacks a distinctive visual style, employing the same palette of drab yellows, greens and blacks that have become de rigeur thanks to the success of the "The Ring" and the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" remake.
One element that seems more progressive than it probably should in the year 2005 is the refreshing lack of attention drawn to Paige and Blake's interracial relationship. In most other respects, however, pic is decidedly retro, employing the moralistic tone of a great many horror outings of the 1970s and '80s, in which only the relatively virtuous survive.

The film, which exerts the gross-out fascination of reality TV's muckier specimens, has nothing new to say about America's fast-food addiction and obesity epidemic, but there's no denying its grotesque effectiveness as a work of public health advocacy.

Gigantic, blustery, and stuffed with cameoed details (Cate Blanchett 's riff on Katharine Hepburn  makes her the dead legend's avatar), it's a biopic paradigmand an American-dream-gone-rancid tale bidding to complement Raging Bull .
