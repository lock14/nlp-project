Boys adventure stories are a dime (store novel) a dozen, but girls adventure tales are rare things indeed. The new film Nim�s Island
, which is adapted from Wendy Orr�s young-adult novel, comes to the rescue with its South Seas setting and message to girls of all ages about the need to become the heroes of their own life stories. The film details the parallel adventures of Nim Rusoe (Breslin), a motherless girl who lives on an otherwise deserted South Pacific atoll with her scientist father (Butler), and Alexandra Rover (Foster), a San Francisco agoraphobe who writes adventure novels about the escapades of her imaginary alter ego, Alex Rover (an Indiana Jones-type fellow who is also incarnated by Butler). Contemporary in nature, Nim�s Island
 incorporates e-mail, satellite telephones, Expedia, and agoraphobia into the storyline, and it�s best not to pause too long to wonder how deserted islands and Wi-Fi go together in the same story. Though the plot hinges on Nim's cry for outside help once her father is presumed lost at sea in a storm and she becomes rattled by a gash in her leg and the invasion of her island by opportunistic sailors, the real character growth belongs to Alexandra, who must brave the world beyond her front door and summon the courage she ordinarily diverts to her fictional surrogate in order to help young Nim. It's lovely to watch Foster in this role, taking a comedic breather from all the high-tension thrillers she's been appearing in of late. Alexandra hearkens back to her days as a Disney TV heroine, fresh-faced and Coppertone-tanned instead of pursed lips and buff efficiency. Breslin tones down the perky effusiveness of her Little Miss Sunshine
 character to create a believable child who has never known any life but the one she's living. Her friends are a lizard, a pelican, and a sea lion with whom she dances and plays soccer. Cast in dual roles, Butler probably has the most fun of all, and the presence of the ruggedly handsome 300
 star will likely prove a sop to the mothers who'll be accompanying their daughters to the movie. Nim's Island
 bogs down a bit in the midsection with a subplot that seems to be more about the "do" than the derring-do, but the oft-cited phrase about becoming the hero of one's own story is a mantra that bears repetition. It's time for girls involved in South Seas adventures to do more than dress up in sarongs like Dorothy Lamour.


One of the more pleasant aspects of "Nim's Island" is that it doesn't fit any of the known profiles for modern family movies: no hip pop-culture references aimed at mom and dad, no world-weary kids cracking wise, no tie-in soundtrack CD. There's only one fart, and it issues from a sea lion.
Another bonus is that 8- to 12-year-olds will have a good time, and you'll have a good time watching them have a good time. Otherwise, the film's an oddity - an engaging, slightly overcooked fantasy about a castaway-island girl and the agoraphobic San Francisco novelist who comes to her rescue.
The casting is heavyweight, though. Abigail Breslin ("Little Miss Sunshine") plays the girl, 11-year-old Nim Rusoe, who lives with her marine biologist dad, Jack (Gerard Butler, of "300"), on a pristine South Pacific island, complete with a dormant (sort of) volcano. Nim's last name is one letter shy of Crusoe and so are her living quarters, a swank bamboo hut outfitted with lab equipment and wicked fast broadband access.
If that's a fantasy, it's an appealing one, and so is Nim's friendship with Selkie the sea lion, Galileo the pelican, and Fred the lizard, each animal given the necessary computer-generated personality assist (at the very least). When Jack doesn't return from a two-day expedition at sea, the worried girl reaches out by e-mail to the strapping hero of her favorite adventure book series, Alex Rover.
The catch is that Alex is actually the author of the books, is named Alexandra, and hasn't left her apartment in 16 weeks. Here we have Jodie Foster making a movie her kids can see (let's hope they weren't invited to the premiere of "The Brave One") as well as a rare foray into comedy. Alex is a neurasthenic basket case who talks to her own fictional character (played by Butler again, in Indiana Jones mode) and gets the willies when she has to step out to the mailbox. The idea that she'll somehow travel halfway around the planet to help Nim is too big for her to even comprehend.
"Nim's Island" is based on a children's book by Wendy Orr, and it makes the leap from page to screen somewhat awkwardly. The film cuts continually between Nim, holding the island against an assault by boobish cruise ship tourists; Jack, trying to keep his crippled boat from sinking in the open sea; and Alex, jumping from plane to helicopter to motorboat to dinghy in an effort to reach the girl. Each of the actors is performing solo, in other words, and this starts to play like a gimmick over the long haul.
It's a nice, dithery vacation for Foster, though, and Breslin is maturing into an actress of interestingly spacey grace. The moral of "Nim's Island" - articulated a number of times, as if a pop-quiz were coming up - is that we all need to be the heroes of our own lives, and that heroism takes many forms, from climbing a volcano to stepping out one's own front door. With luck, your kids will remember that as well as the farting sea lion.


Abigail Breslin stars in Nim's Island  as a young girl living on a remote tropical outpost with only her scientist father (Gerard Butler) and a passel of anthropomorphized animal friends. When dad goes missing on a solo research trip, Nim reaches out to her literary hero, the dashing adventurer Alex Rover. Alex, it turns out, is actually an Alexandra  played as a neurotic, Purell-pumping agoraphobe by Jodie Foster. It's hard to imagine kids not enjoying the good-hearted, lovingly shot fantasy of it all, and Breslin is charming, though most viewers past puberty will likely yearn to be voted off the Island.

 If “Nim’s Island” were anything but a children’s movie, the casting genius who suggested Jodie Foster as a potential love interest for Gerard Butler would be looking for a new occupation. But miscasting isn’t the only problem with this sweet but ho-hum adaptation of Wendy Orr’s novel, a comedy-adventure that never quite finds its tone.  The island in question lies deep in the South Pacific (beautifully played by the Gold Coast of Australia) and is home to Nim (Abigail Breslin) and her father, Jack (Mr. Butler). Motherless and near-fatherless (Jack spends his days studying plankton),  Nim amuses herself with a stable of performing pets and the literary adventures of an Indiana Jones-style hero named Alex Rover. When Jack is trapped by a storm at sea, and Nim  sends an e-mail message to Rover for help, she’s unaware that the recipient is his agoraphobic creator, Alexandra (Ms. Foster).  Playing yet another tightly wound woman, Ms. Foster makes a slapstick meal of rushing to Nim’s aid. Yet this is a story about hiding from the world — whether on a remote island or inside your head — and the film’s sensitive notes are too often jarred by its attempts to score cheap comic points from sea lion flatulence and obese Australian tourists. The message that lifelong connections can be forged through books is a lovely one; too bad it’s obscured by flying lizards.

Like a lush tropical getaway that promises paradise and delivers something closer to purgatory, "Nim's Island" is a picturesque adventure-comedy that quickly capsizes under the weight of its obnoxious slapstick, pedestrian dialogue and general unwillingness to rise above stock ideas and situations. Recasting Robinson Crusoe as a young 21st-century heroine, and confirming Walden Media's rep as a maker of slick, professional family entertainments of highly variable quality, this strictly-for-kids Fox release should ride the significant appeal of stars Abigail Breslin and Jodie Foster to make midsize B.O. waves.
There's a difference between skewing toward young audiences and targeting dimwits of all ages, and too often this adaptation of Wendy Orr's 1999 novel veers toward the latter. As directed by the husband-and-wife team of Mark Levin and Jennifer Flackett ("Little Manhattan"), who share scripting chores with Joseph Kwong and producer Paula Mazur, "Nim's Island" is much easier on the eyes than it is on the ears. It's the sort of movie that compels its characters to recap plot points that weren't exactly mind-bending the first time, read messages aloud even when the words are perfectly legible onscreen, and never miss an opportunity to overstate the obvious.
Breslin plays plucky, prepubescent tyke Nim Rusoe (get it?), who, for as long as she can recall, has lived happily with her scientist-writer dad Jack (Gerard Butler) in a large treehouse -- handily outfitted with electricity and high-speed Internet -- on an uncharted Pacific island. But when a violent storm hits and Jack is lost at sea, Nim seeks help through a chance correspondence with a person she thinks is the great explorer Alex Rover.
Trouble is, she's actually exchanging emails with Alexandra Rover (Foster), a severely agoraphobic San Francisco author who couldn't be more different from the Indiana Jones-style hero she writes about in her bestselling adventure novels. But Alexandra, touched by the girl's pleas and spurred on by visions of Alex (also played by Butler) only she can see, decides to break out of her shut-in existence, find her way to the island and, inevitably, become the mother Nim never knew. (Latter was apparently swallowed by a whale shortly after Nim's birth, as recounted in a five-minute prologue and cloyingly referenced throughout.)
Even the journey to this halfway mark seems to tax the film's resources to the point of exhaustion, as the story bogs down in an excess of dialogue (some of it expository, most of it just embarrassing), half-hearted action-adventure mayhem, the usual supporting cast of friendly wildlife, and hyperactive cross-cutting among the principal characters.
While Nim attempts to contact her father and ward off some opportunistic island crashers, Alexandra trips, bumbles and vomits her way across the Pacific, affording Foster a rare opportunity to flex her physical-comedy muscles. But bearing the brunt of the pic's increasingly tiresome pratfalls, she flexes rather too hard and too often.
Breslin is appealing and sparky as always but not much more in this lackluster addition to her resume, and her character's tilt toward bratty self-entitlement in the second act underscores the reality that Nim's wilderness existence is too cushy by half, a spoiled Girl Scout's castaway fantasy. Butler, for his part, is both figuratively and literally at sea, as his Jack is forced to spend a ridiculous length of screen time hanging on for dear life.
Lenser Stuart Dryburgh takes full advantage of the widescreen to frame the gorgeous sunsets and beaches of Australia's Gold Coast and Hinchinbrook Island. Production designer Barry Robison created the paper puppets and miniatures used in the lovely opening and end-credits sequences, although the latter would've benefited from a more imaginative song choice than U2's "Beautiful Day."
Pic's souped-up, high-tech "Swiss Family Robinson" aesthetic is borne out by an alarming number of product placements: When Nim and Alexandra exchange emails, the Apple logos on their computers seem to glow in unison, as clear a sign as any that they're destined to live happily ever after.
