How many laughs can one movie try to squeeze out of Vaughn being attacked by elves? Sadly, it�s an awful lot. If you�re going to have a movie heavily reliant on physical comedy and sight gags, that�s fine. You just need to make sure they�re funny. And in this case, they�re not. Vaughn plays Fred, the embittered older brother of the sainted (literally) Nicholas �Santa� Claus (Giamatti). The story begins in some vague fairy-tale past where we see the young brothers� childhood. Nick�s nascent charity blooms, while Fred�s resentment toward his brother festers. Cut to present day, several centuries later. A grandfatherly narrator informs us that because Nicholas is a saint, he and his family live forever. I�m not quite sure how the Catholic Church would feel about this convenient rule. But in the world of Fred Claus
, there�s one simple philosophy: If the plot isn�t working, make up another rule. Trading in jolly for neurotic, Giamatti�s Santa possesses a self-deprecating everyman demeanor that makes him a brilliant actor. Meanwhile, Vaughn exploits a schtick that plays well with an ensemble (Old School
) or in a supporting role (Mr. & Mrs. Smith
) but cannot carry the comedy of an entire movie. (Even in The Wedding Crashers
, Vaughn's last movie with director Dobkin, he co-starred with Owen Wilson.) An embittered and delinquent man-child, Fred is desperate to raise $50,000 in order to start yet another shady business venture. His brother Nick will give him the money only if Fred visits the North Pole, and needless to say, Fred agrees. Before long, he's teaching the elves about rock & roll and cutting loose and becomes the frequent target of angry elves bent on protecting Santa. So trouble brews, and toy-making is threatened, which gives ammunition to Clyde (Spacey), the angry efficiency inspector looking for reasons to shut down Santa�s workshop. Despite stealing every scene he�s in, this two-time Oscar-winner can�t save this movie. And ironically, if there�s one thing this film needs, it�s an efficiency inspector. Awash with amazingly talented actors and comedians, including Higgins as a lovelorn elf, Richardson as Mrs. Claus, and Bates as Fred and Santa�s mom, Fred Claus
 is sadly just an early lump of coal under the tree.


"Fred Claus" sells you something you didn't know you wanted: a Vince Vaughn Christmas movie. Vaughn is not the hook. Neither is the holiday. The script, by Dan Fogelman, is smarter than that. It hitches the old homecoming story to a tale about the corporatization of Christmas. The movie is indeed about Santa's shady estranged brother, Fred, whom Vaughn plays equidistantly between lovable and loutish. But there are crises. Santa (Paul Giamatti) makes Fred come back to the North Pole from Chicago to earn $50,000 for a business venture by toiling in the workshop.
He arrives at the same time as an efficiency expert (Kevin Spacey, looking pickled) who flies in to maximize toy production. Demand for toys per letter has skyrocketed, and the elves are having a dickens of a time keeping apace. The board - there's a board - even threatens to outsource work to . . . the South Pole. Needless to say, Santa is sick with stress, and Fred initially doesn't help. He encourages workshop-wide dance parties that halt efficiency and, in a rage, stamps every wish-list letter "nice," which, apparently, is very naughty.
The movie feels like some TV drama's premise given generous splashes of wit, color, and Oscar-winners. Kathy Bates plays Mama Claus, and Rachel Weisz, who's never been more accessible, plays Fred's
 had-it-up-to-here British meter-maid girlfriend. The rest of the cast includes Miranda Richardson as Ms. Claus, and Bobb'e J. Thompson as the urchin upstairs from Fred bound for a life in the foster-care system. When he cries out, "Macaroni," the movie's sniffle index practically quadruples.
But wait: Before tears, there are laughs. The movie comes up with a nifty support group called Siblings Anonymous, and one of the sustained visual jokes in "Fred Claus" is that Vaughn is a giant among the elves. The inspired production design keeps Fred outside any physical comfort zone. The bunk bed he shares with Willie (John Michael Higgins), the chief elf, is so small a third of him spills over the edge. Clever special effects have made believable elves of actors like Higgins and Ludacris, who plays the workshop DJ. And watching this great big man - Vaughn is 6 feet, 5 inches - manhandling a mini-Ludacris is funny.
But the movie showcases the proportional differences in unexpectedly sweet ways. Willie is in love with Charlene, Santa's personal assistant, a bosomy human-size lass played by the irresistibly kittenish Elizabeth Banks. Willie has no idea how to get her to notice him, so Fred teaches the little guy to dance, encouraging the reluctant Willie to hold him even though he comes up to about Fred's belt. You probably won't see a more genuine display of friendship in a movie for the rest of the year.
Of course, at this point you're reading words like "sweet" and "kittenish" and "friendship" and probably wondering why you're not seeing "vulgar," "lewd," and "covered my ears." It's true that "Fred Claus" has been directed by David Dobkin, the man who also made the exuberant "Wedding Crashers." It's also true that "you can take the kids" and "Vince Vaughn" have rarely appeared in the same sentence, but the movie is not a work of cynicism. This is no "Bad Santa." And it's warm without feeling ersatz. I was prepared for Giamatti, for instance, to make due with Santa duty by condescending to the part and turning the character into an unhappy clown. But while the little ones might lean over and ask, "Is Saint Nick from Brooklyn?" I'm certain they won't have seen a more emotionally complex Santa Claus this side of "Miracle on 34th Street."
Meanwhile, Vaughn's crude stylings are mercifully intact. More than ever he resembles a giant, hungover, vaguely bloated Tony Curtis, and he still talks with an auctioneer's velocity. But his naughtiness has never seemed so approachably nice. The movie includes a montage of Vaughn scarfing down the thank-you cookies expectant gift-getters leave for Santa. Somebody puts out a flan, and the sight of him gobbling that, too, is probably the nicest gift anybody will give me this Christmas.


The post-pumpkin, pre-Christmas family comedy Fred Claus  is constructed like a rattling Santa sack of stocking stuffers, most of them plastic, doled out with little confidence about what adults want from a jingle-bell comedy (we want Elf !), and even less about what engages a kid (they want Elf !).
So here's a machine-stitched lesson on the importance of being there for one's sibling, offered with familiar huckster patter by Vince Vaughn as a firstborn son  he's Fred  who's sick and tired of trailing in the shadow of his younger brother (Paul Giamatti), best known by his superstar handle, Santa Claus. Here's some chaste courtship shenanigans acted out by an elf (John Michael Higgins) and Santa's very special helper-with-cleavage (Elizabeth Banks). Here's a trendy homily about the Oprah-given right of every kid to be registered on Santa's list as nice and not naughty. And here, retro as a Slinky, is Kevin Spacey doing a classic turn as a sharky, corporate Grinch type.

 Given the tasty cocktail of self-amusement and self-contempt  that Vince Vaughn brings to almost every on-screen party, it seemed possible that this was one guy who would just say no to Merry Christmas. Forget it: “Fred Claus” is a tacky would-be comedy about family dysfunction that fronts some Scrooge attitude only to dissolve into slobbering sentimentality and canned uplift. Neither here nor there, the film is “Elf” without the goofy jokes, Will Ferrell or heart, “Bad Santa” without the smut, Billy Bob Thornton or spleen.  Mainly it’s a lackadaisical mess, though one graced with welcome talent, including Paul Giamatti and Miranda Richardson. (Here’s hoping these indie stalwarts pocketed decent  studio checks for keeping their gifts in idle.) Mr. Vaughn plays Fred Claus, the disgruntled eldest brother of Nicholas Claus a k a Santa Claus a k a St. Nick a k a Mr. Giamatti, wearing a fat suit and snowy clouds of hair and beard.  Once upon a storybook time the Claus boys were born (to Kathy Bates), only to subsequently go their separate ways. Somehow Nicholas grew up to become Santa, and Fred turned into a Chicago motormouth with pouchy eyes and a hot girl (Rachel Weisz) who in real life would chuck him along with her unflattering wardrobe.  Instead, this lovely meter maid has to play  constant   kiss-and-make-up with Fred, a hustler by inclination and verbal dexterity who talks big, talks fast and tends to go belly up. Hustling ain’t easy, which is how he ends up in the clink and, shortly thereafter, at the North Pole trying to make good on a loan from his generous baby brother. There, to Fred’s astonishment, he discovers that all the elves in Santa’s workshop are Chinese laborers who earn 25 cents an hour churning out lead-coated toys for the American market at backbreaking, soul-crushing speed. Whoops! That’s the movie I was making in my head as the colors and shapes, and the strings of words were arranged and rearranged from shot to shot, scene to scene.  Lessons are learned, smiles are cracked, as are mirthless jokes, most at the expense of the shorter members of the cast. The director, David Dobkin, who did far better with “Wedding Crashers,” never settles into a coherent or workable groove, trying on moods (breezy, frantic, maudlin) that never stick or develop. (It’s difficult to reconcile the film’s ugly, alternately over-lighted and under-lighted photography with the cinematographer Remi Adefarasin’s professional work in “Elizabeth: The Golden Age.”)  The screenplay, credited to Dan Fogelman, feels similarly incoherent, a confusion of shtick and schmaltz. The less said the better about the digital wizardry that sticks famous heads on nonfamous bodies, Frankenstein-style. If you’ve ever wondered what the rapper Ludacris would look like if he were a dwarf, now’s your chance.  With “Fred Claus,” Mr. Vaughn seems to be trying out a more audience-friendly, mainstream persona, something he can cultivate when he’s too old to play naughty. It doesn’t work, partly because the film reeks, partly because nice isn’t (yet) in his on-screen DNA. There’s a touch of the con man to many of his characters, and it often feels as if he’s selling  something to someone. Here, though, he doesn’t seem to have conned even himself into thinking this movie a good idea. It’s no wonder when its most memorable scene finds Fred teaching an elf, Willie (John Michael Higgins’s head, Jorge Rodero’s   body), how to slow dance, a task that involves the kind of intimate eye-to-crotch gazing not usually seen in Christmas movies.  “Fred Claus” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Sexual innuendo and ninja elf violence.

The burden of having a famous sibling seems fraught with comedic possibilities, but whatever potential existed has been squandered and then some in �Fred Claus,� dumping coal into everyone�s holiday stocking. Although promoted as a comedy, this reunion of �Wedding Crashers� star Vince Vaughn and director David Dobkin alternates between unpleasantness and Hallmark-sweet sappiness, with the only clever (if predictable) sequence occurring well into the second hour. Disney enjoyed considerable success with �The Santa Clause� years ago, but solid early returns within that niche should evaporate once word of mouth earmarks this Warner Bros. release for the �naughty� bin.
The shortcomings are nearly as bountiful as a child�s Christmas wish list, but the movie�s central problem begins with Vaughn�s casting in the title role and the seeming inability to shackle his rapid-fire delivery and angry persona so that it adheres in even the smallest way to the fuzzy material.
Introduced via a prologue fraught with lapses in logic that, in a better movie, would have been easier to ignore, young Fred is the older brother of saintly Nicholas (Paul Giamatti), who grows up to become Santa Claus. (Something about the family never aging awkwardly explains the contemporary setting.)
Today, Fred is a fast-talking big-city repo man willing to fake being a charity to generate cash for a business venture, in part because he so desperately resents Nicholas and his parents for doting on their younger son. Yet when Fred gets into trouble and can�t reach his girlfriend (Rachel Weisz), he calls Nicholas, who insists that his brother come to the North Pole to work for him and earn his loan.
Ferried up by a chipper elf named Willie (John Michael Higgins), Fred immediately begins creating headaches for Santa, who is under additional pressure this holiday season. �The board� has sent an efficiency expert � played with ill-concealed malice by Kevin Spacey � to evaluate his operation.
What ensues, then, is an inordinate amount of shrillness and bickering (there�s even a family intervention) before the seemingly inevitable moment when Fred must discover the true meaning of � Christmas? Family? It�s not quite clear � and proceeds to help save the holiday for children the world over.
Although unintentionally so, not since �Bad Santa� has jolly old St. Nick been so abused. If �Fred Claus� was designed to soften Vaughn�s image for a family audience, he clearly didn�t get the memo, and an assortment of talented actors (among them Giamatti, Weisz, Spacey and Miranda Richardson as Mrs. Claus) look out of place and unhappy pretty much throughout.
Nor does it help that the movie is technically shoddy, with Santa�s village resembling something one might encounter at the local mall. Even more conspicuously phony is a technique called �digital head replacement� employed to superimpose the faces of Higgins and rapper Chris �Ludacris� Bridges onto elf-sized bodies � a considerable waste of blue-screen time, given the results. Apparently, no one bothered to check out �The Lord of the Rings� trilogy for more elegant man-to-Hobbit conversion tips.
For studios, feel-good holiday movies should represent the ultimate commercial no-brainer, but �Fred Claus� follows in the feel-bad footsteps of �Deck the Halls� � movies so tone-deaf and disagreeable as to have completely worn out their welcome by the time that gush of last-act warmth arrives.
In that respect, Hollywood might be making an inadvertent contribution to family values, what with the rather cynical image of movies as a means to escape family interaction around the holidays. Given options such as this, suddenly sitting around staring at each other doesn�t sound quite so bad. 


Vince Vaughn  delves into the pre-teen demo, hoping that parents will enjoy the added value of seeing their favorite wise-ass wreaking havoc in Toyland. Vaughn plays Santa's no-good older brother Fred, who works as a repo man in Chicago and, in scheming to raise enough money to buy a restaurant, bilks some Salvation Army  Santas and winds up in the slammer. Meanwhile, Santa's workshop is having a hard time keeping up with the increased demand of today's greedy kids, so Santa (Paul Giamatti ) offers to give Fred seed money if he'll just come up to the North Pole  and help out with the Christmas rush. The exceptional castVaughn, Giamatti, Kathy Bates , Kevin Spacey , Rachel Weisz is an embarrassment of riches for a script this thin and this beholden to family-fare protocol, with its mushy-minded moral and slick sentimentality. Lacking the absurdist je ne say what of fellow crank Bill Murray  (who tried his hand at Christmas fare with Scrooged ), the demonic physical comedy of Ben Stiller  (amassing kid cred with Night at the Museum ), or the freestyling innocence of Will Ferrell  (Elf ), Vaughn brings to the kiddie party the same thing he brings to the adult party: a six-foot-five attitude problem. Whether a giant man with an extensive flannel collection and a big mouth will have crossover (or -under) appeal is anyone's guess.
