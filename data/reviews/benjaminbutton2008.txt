'Button' takes Pitt from old man to glowing youth
In "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Brad Pitt ages in reverse, from Methuselah to Robert Redford to infancy in about 2 1/2 hours. When Benjamin is 60 he looks 20, and we have on our hands the perfect movie for a time of enhanced age-defiance. And David Fincher, the movie's director, is a cosmetic surgeon of sorts, exacting a spectacularly artificial work of beauty. Watching a smooth face emerge from so much bunched and ruched skin is like seeing a piece of ripe fruit emerge from its husk. "Benjamin Button" is several hours of meticulous peeling - but not of a grapefruit but a grape.
Movie magic places Pitt's shriveled face on a tiny geriatric stunt body that somehow is never hideous. Sometime in 1918, Benjamin's disgusted father (Jason Flemyng), a New Orleans button baron, logically leaves his wizened bundle of joy on the steps of a retirement home. Its resident caretaker, a petite but assertive black woman named Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), takes a peek inside the blanket, recoils in surprise, but decides to raise him as the miracle baby he is. She bathes him, loves him, scolds him both as if he were her own son and another wrinkled mouth to feed.
There is some wonderful comedy in these sequences, particularly where Henson gets to perform a kind of exasperated compassion at the expense of her charges. She performs well beyond the limits of her allotted stereotype. Fincher also has a very good time sending his camera lurking around the house, getting close to the residents before they vanish. The movie sporadically reenacts a codger's tale of the seven times he was struck by lightning as an amusing silent-movie flipbook.
Benjamin, of course, watches his old friends fall apart while his physical enhancements confound everyone. "What elixir have you been drinking," asks one woman. His brothel trips suggest hookers are his Metamucil. By 1936 Benjamin is 17 going on 63, and the country certainly progresses with him. But we never see it. With creeping disappointment, you begin to realize that Fincher is engaged in gated-community filmmaking. The decades pass, and current events fail to make an appreciable dent on this man or this movie. Benjamin leaves Queenie, and, after some time at sea with a tugboat operated by a robustly nonsensical Jared Harris, he spends most of the war years in a Russian hotel attending a series of midnight rendezvous with Tilda Swinton, as a married Englishwoman.
These are lovely, delicately acted, superbly orchestrated sequences. Fincher appears to have let some steady warmth into his formal exactitude. "Se7en" and "Fight Club," both with Pitt, and last year's "Zodiac" are Fincher's dystopic signatures. But if this movie is uncharacteristically radiant (and, my, is it), then it's also aloof and unexpectedly ordinary. "Benjamin Button" shares its title with a 1922 F. Scott Fitzgerald short story. The film is not remotely as strange or coarse as its source. Fincher and the screenwriter Eric Roth have given the Fitzgerald story a glamorous facelift, focusing their film almost entirely on Benjamin's relationship with Daisy, the ballerina whom he adores. She happens to share her name and loveliness with Fitzgerald's most famous heroine. Cate Blanchett plays the part with resplendent, if unnatural serenity. She's not a woman here. She's a corsage. The movie gets as lost in them as they do in each other, which is more of a drag than watching Pitt and Blanchett should be. But it elevates their love to an impossible height. It's bigger than the Kennedy assassination, the Civil Rights Movement, Vietnam, and disco. Yet as romance, it never feels that momentous.
If this story of a kind of American savant's travels and travails sounds familiar, Roth also wrote "Forrest Gump." The movies are twin picaresques. In some ways, "Gump" was the riskier film since it acknowledged, however reductively, the world churning around its hero. When the Beatles' performance of "Twist and Shout" on "Ed Sullivan" plays during a montage of Benjamin and Daisy's homemaking and lovemaking, you wonder whether they can truly hear it.
There would probably be no reason to notice the movie's sense of disconnection were Hurricane Katrina not nipping at its heels. The story is told in flashbacks that spring from Benjamin's diary, from which old Daisy's grown daughter (Julia Ormond - she lives!) reads aloud at her mother's sickbed. The storm and its waters eventually join WWII, that Beatles song, and the codger's fabled lightning strikes as part of the film's ornamental finery. For all its astounding physical scale, the movie's force of vision is small. This Katrina wouldn't disturb a snow dome.
At its most profound, "Benjamin Button" isn't about anything more important than Pitt's very handsomeness, which, for a surprising stretch of time, is a wonderful subject for study. There is a sad scene that requires him to leave a room, and the sheer fact of how young he seems really is breathtaking. I almost gasped at one point. His acting here is entirely static and observational. It's exactly what Pitt did as Death in "Meet Joe Black": He just sits there. And yet this time there's something alluring about that: He's sitting to have a filmmaker take an elaborate photo. That's a painstaking process, but it's the one portrait Fincher gets completely right.


The Curious Case of Benjamin Button  tells the haunting, existential fable of a man, born at the close of World War I, who ages backwards while those around him age forward, the old-fashioned way. Where others are born unformed and unwrinkled, Benjamin comes into the world a decrepit old man; where others wither, he dies in a pink and creaseless state of infancy. For Benjamin, love is inextricable from loss since his path runs counterclockwise to nature. This unsettling, melancholy notion is attached by the thinnest thread to its original literary source, a 1922 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald. But in the hands of director David Fincher , and with Brad Pitt  as Benjamin, this Button  is a curious case indeed: an extravagantly ambitious movie that's easy to admire but a challenge to love.
Perhaps that's how it ought to be. Eric Roth's fanciful screenplay makes use of a cheesy Bridges of Madison County  structure to frame the mythic saga  a grown daughter (Julia Ormond ) learns her mother's romantic secrets as the old woman lays dying in a New Orleans hospital bed just as Hurricane Katrina is gathering force. The old woman, named Daisy, is Cate Blanchett  after many hours with make-up artists; the secret is that Daisy met Benjamin in Louisiana a lifetime ago when the two were kids and he was old/young, and their love went on and on in its fashion. A different director might have emphasized sentimentality in the manner of a Robin Williams weepy with a message: We're all going to die, so love while you get a chance!  Instead, Fincher's innate astringency  his hardness, even, which he has put to such varied effect over the years in Fight Club , Seven ,  and Zodiac    becomes exactly the kind of tonic needed to balance the sweet/tart proportions of so audacious a cinematic project.
At any moment in this singular Hollywood spectacle, two marvels predominate, one technical and the other...Bradical. The movie has been in the works for years, pored over by Fincher like a favorite fairytale from his childhood. But only now has computer-driven wizardry matured enough to meet the story's challenges so unobtrusively. Likewise, Pitt, a comely actor, is no longer the golden surprise he was 18 years ago in Thelma & Louise  . What he is, though, is a phenomenon of heightened celebrity. And that rarified status, combined with good grooming and exquisite digital effects care, produces the exact force field of fame needed to take our breath away in that first moment on screen when, rid of gray hair, Benjamin is bathed in light that honors the movie-star beauty Pitt is. Was. Is.
In his transient loveliness, the star's character is rewarded with the company of an equally radiant woman. Or three. At first, when young/old Benjamin is a grotesque-looking abandoned newborn, he's taken in by a kindly New Orleans nursing-home attendant (a tender Taraji P. Henson ) who loves him as a son. Later, before he and Daisy meet up again in adulthood, the hero learns about sex and desire from a wise, worldly lady (Tilda Swinton , never better). By the time his love affair with Daisy crests, the pair are equals, and as a couple of blooming lovers, Blanchett's limpid performance rises up to meet Pitt's, petal for petal.
Yet Fincher has little time for assuring sweetness or audience caresses, not when Daisy's future is physical decay while Benjamin's is mental regression. Calling forth the flood waters of Katrina as a symbol of the inability to stop time is distracting, even presumptuous and brutal. Still, the point is made: Life is a tide, a flood even, against which youth, beauty, and even Brad Pitt have no magical powers.

 “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” which occupies around 25 pages in the collected works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a slender piece of whimsy, a charming fantasy about a man who ages in reverse, descending through the years from newborn senescence to terminal infancy. As Fitzgerald unravels it, Benjamin’s story serves as the pretext for some amusing, fairly superficial observations about child rearing, undergraduate behavior and courtship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  From this odd, somewhat unpromising kernel, the director David Fincher and the screenwriter Eric Roth have cultivated a lush, romantic hothouse bloom, a film that shares only a title and a basic premise with its literary source. “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,” more than two and a half hours long, sighs with longing and simmers with intrigue while investigating the philosophical conundrums and emotional paradoxes of its protagonist’s condition in a spirit that owes more to Jorge Luis Borges than to Fitzgerald.  While the film’s plot progresses, with a few divagations, in a straight line through the decades of Benjamin Button’s life, the backward vector of that biography turns this “Curious Case” into a genuine mystery. And the puzzles it invites us to contemplate — in consistently interesting, if not always dramatically satisfying ways — are deep and imposing, concerning the passage of time, the elusiveness of experience and the Janus-faced nature of love.  Above all, though, “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” is a triumph of technique. Building on the advances of pioneers like Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson and Robert Zemeckis — and on his own previous work adapting newfangled means to traditional cinematic ends — Mr. Fincher (“Fight Club,” “Zodiac”) has added a dimension of delicacy and grace to digital filmmaking. While it stands on the shoulders of breakthroughs like “Minority Report,” “The Lord of the Rings” and “Forrest Gump” (for which Mr. Roth wrote the screenplay), “Benjamin Button” may be the most dazzling such hybrid yet, precisely because it is the subtlest. While he does treat the audience to a few grand, special-effect showpieces, Mr. Fincher concentrates his ingenuity on the setting and the characters, in particular — and most arrestingly — on the faces of his stars, Cate Blanchett and Brad Pitt.  Ms. Blanchett is Daisy, a dancer, bohemian and all-around free spirit who ages gracefully, before our eyes, into a stately modern matron and then into a wasted, breathless old woman. Mr. Pitt, for the most part, plays Benjamin, who is born, looking like a man in his 70s, into a prominent New Orleans family in 1918. I say for the most part because near the end of the movie Mr. Pitt is replaced by younger and younger children and also because, at the beginning, he is evoked by an uncanny computer-generated confection that seems to have been distilled from his essence. This creature, tiny and wizened, is at once boy and man, but in every scene the ratio is readjusted, until the strapping figure of a familiar movie star emerges, gradually and all but imperceptibly.  The inner life of Benjamin Button, abandoned at birth by his stricken father (Jason Flemyng) and raised by the infinitely kind caretaker of a nursing home (Taraji P. Henson), is harder to grasp than his outer appearance, in part because Mr. Pitt seems more interested in the nuances of reticence than in the dynamics of expression. It’s true that Benjamin’s condition imposes a certain detachment: he is at once innocent and ancient, almost never who he appears to be.  But even though Mr. Pitt’s coolness is a perfectly defensible approach to this character, his elusiveness, from one film to the next, is starting to look more defensive than daring. His recent performances have been devoted mainly to the study of his own magnetism, a quality he earnestly explores in “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” and playfully subverts in “Burn After Reading.” It goes without saying that Mr. Pitt has charisma to burn, and he is a capable and inventive actor, but he will only be a great one if he risks breaking himself open on screen as he did, briefly, in “Babel.”  And so, while Benjamin’s progress through life drives the narrative of “The Curious Case,” he is (as the title suggests) more an object of contemplation than a flesh-and-blood (or bit-and-byte) candidate for our empathy. His jaunt through the 20th century is certainly fun to watch, with an episodic rhythm that recalls old movie serials or, even more, the endlessly dilated adventures of newspaper comic-strip heroes. After some initiation into the pleasures of the flesh and the bottle in the city of his birth, Young Button (Old Button) hires onto a tramp steamer. He tarries a while in Russia, sampling caviar and adultery (with a superbly soignée Tilda Swinton) before World War II intrudes.  Later there will be sailboats and motorcycles as the ambient light turns gold along with Mr. Pitt’s hair. There will not be much in the way of big events or public happenings — Benjamin Button is, finally, no Forrest Gump — and though he is a white Southerner raised by a black woman, he seems untouched by racial turmoil or by much of anything beyond the mysteries of his peculiar destiny.  But the movie’s emotional center of gravity — the character who struggles and changes and feels — is Daisy, played by Ms. Blanchett from impetuous ingénue to near ghost with an almost otherworldly mixture of hauteur and heat. The story of Benjamin’s life is read to Daisy by her daughter (Julia Ormond) in a New Orleans hospital room in 2005, just as Hurricane Katrina is approaching the city. The imminence of the storm is a superfluous and unduly portentous device, since Katrina brings to mind precisely the hard, real-life miseries the movie has done everything in its power to avoid.  That power, though, is something to be reckoned with, and it resides in Mr. Fincher’s ability to use his unbelievable skills to turn an incredible conceit into a plausible love story. The romance between Daisy and Benjamin begins when both are chronologically pre-adolescents and Benjamin is, physically, a codger, but the initial element of pedophilic creepiness in the relationship gives way to other forms of awkwardness. Their love is uniquely perfect and enduring. At the same time, like any other love — like any movie — it is shadowed by disappointment and fated to end. In the case of “Benjamin Button,” I was sorry when it was over and happy to have seen it.  “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some scenes of sex and violence.

"The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" represents a richly satisfying serving of deep-dish Hollywood storytelling. This odd, epic tale of a man who ages backwards is presented in an impeccable classical manner, every detail tended to with fastidious devotion. An example of the most advanced technology placed entirely at the service of story and character, this significant change-of-pace from director David Fincher poses some daunting marketing challenges, even with Brad Pitt atop the cast. Strong critical support will be needed to swell interest in this absorbing, even moving, but emotionally cool film, which is simultaneously accessible and distinctive enough to catch on with a large public if luck and the zeitgeist are with it. 
Due to its history-spanning structure, blank-page title character and technical sleight of hand, the film "Benjamin Button" most recalls is "Forrest Gump," but in a good way; it is entirely possible to dislike the 1994 smash and embrace this one, which resists every opportunity for mawkish and sentimental displays. Still, it is no coincidence that Eric Roth wrote both of them, and Roth -- who followed many other writers, including credited co-story author Robin Swicord, in trying to crack the long-gestating project -- has veered far from the specifics of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1921 short story.
Fitzgerald's original was inspired by a Mark Twain observation to the effect that it's a pity the best part of life comes at the beginning and the worst part at the end. Yarn began in 1860 Baltimore, had Benjamin, born looking like a 70-year-old man, raised by his father, marrying and having a son, starring for Harvard in football and ending his life by attending kindergarten with his own grandson.
Using precious little of the story save the central aging conceit, Roth's version ranges from World War I into the 21st century and creatively uses New Orleans as its base, with sojourns to distant corners of the globe. Scripter could have chosen to make the central figure a more exceptional, active character -- a doer of great things, or an intellectual with an acute awareness of his unique condition. Instead, Benjamin is a passive sort to whom things happen, a trait by no means an impediment to audience involvement. Gump was like that, as were Dr. Zhivago and others.
Fincher spends 13 minutes short of three hours telling this unique man's life story, and the time goes by easily, with no sense of dawdling, waste or indulgence. The film evinces a sure hand that maintains narrative confidence, steadiness of tone and a mature awareness of the temporal nature of life's opportunities and the fleeting quality of happiness.
Death pervades the film and Benjamin's life, but in a matter-of-fact, rather than depressing way; if you're raised among oldsters in a retirement home, death is never a stranger. Framing story is set in a modern hospital room, where the fading Daisy (a recognizable Cate Blanchett under heavy makeup) has her 40ish daughter Caroline (Julia Ormond) read to her from the diary of her late dear friend Benjamin.
Benjamin is born of the armistice and is lovingly raised by a black attendant, Queenie (Taraji P. Henson), at the rest home. An establishment awash in the gentility of the Old South, the place is ideal for a child who, with his bald pate, cataracts, deficient hearing and need for a wheelchair, fits right in with the other occupants.
When he's 12 and looks about 70, Benjamin meets a resident's lovely red-haired granddaughter, Daisy. No doubt named in homage to the immortal heroine of Fitzgerald's "The Great Gatsby," Daisy will zig-zag in and out of his life from then on and eventually embody his emotional touchstone.
With a solicitous stranger he doesn't know is actually his father (Jason Flemyng), as well as with an African pygmy bon vivant (Rampai Mohadi), Benjamin gets a taste of the outside world, including the pleasures of the flesh at a bordello. He also befriends hard-drinking tugboat captain Mike (Jared Harris) and, in time-honored tradition for a young man, goes to sea. In one of the film's most bewitching interludes, Benjamin, who has begun to realize he's looking younger, has an affair in Murmansk with the sophisticated Elizabeth (Tilda Swinton), from whom he learns what it is to be loved and desired. Pic's action highlight is a startling nocturnal encounter between the tug and a Nazi U-boat that has just sunk a troop transport.
Safely back in New Orleans after the war, Benjamin becomes reacquainted with Daisy, now a rising dancer and unashamed sensualist who comes on a little strong for her old friend. But after his father dies, leaving him his button factory and entire estate, Benjamin follows Daisy to New York, where he sees her dancing the ballet in "Carousel," then to Paris, only to continue being rejected by the headstrong young woman even after she suffers a terrible tragedy detailed in a suspense montage that by itself reps a dazzling display of directorial savoir faire.
Much of the film's romantic and philosophical posture hinges on Benjamin and Daisy getting together at the right time, and they do so in an entirely satisfying way; by the time of consummation, with Brad Pitt now in full physical glory and Blanchett at her womanly peak, they -- and the audience -- are more than ready for it. But their passion is all the more pointedly ephemeral due to the consciousness of being headed in opposite physical directions. The necessary acceptance of this fact produces a sincerely and genuinely earned sense of melancholy about the transitive nature of love and life.
The extent to which Fincher and his vast team of collaborators have succeeded in their storytelling can be seen by the fact that one comes out of the film thinking about the characters and narrative intent, not the admittedly amazing aging effects and other technical achievements. Truly, the visions of Benjamin and other central characters at different ages are sights to behold; baby Ben resembling a little E.T., Blanchett appearing a convincing 23. But truly the most unnerving image is Pitt looking more or less the way he did in "Thelma and Louise," or at least half the age of the man now playing the character. Clearly anything is possible.
In all his physical manifestations, Benjamin is a reactor, not a perpetrator, and Pitt inhabits the role genially, gently and sympathetically. Blanchett's Daisy is the more volatile and moody one and, after bluntly revealing the selfish impetuousness of Daisy's youthful self, the thesp fully registers both the passion and insecurity of the mature woman.
Henson, as Benjamin's surrogate mother, and Swinton as the calculating adulteress, are wonderful, and Harris and Mohadi etch particularly colorful supporting turns as two of Benjamin's rowdier cohorts.
Every scene is crammed with detail, from the nooks and crannies of the settings created by production designer Donald Graham Burt and the century-bridging costumes by Jacqueline West to the faces of the main cast and countless extras. Alexandre Desplat's score provides lovely and unobtrusive dramatic support. Fincher and lenser Claudio Miranda shoot mostly in deep focus images to maximize the information in every frame, and the depth of the blacks they achieve shooting on digital is extraordinary.
Still, for what is designed as a rich tapestry, the picture maintains a slightly remote feel. No matter the power of the image of an old but young-looking Benjamin, slumped over a piano and depressed about his fading memory and life; it is possible that the picture might have been warmer and more emotionally accessible had it been shot on film. It has been argued that digital is a cold medium and celluloid a hot one and a case, however speculative, could be made that a story such as "Benjamin Button," with its desired cumulative emotional impact, should be shot and screened on film to be fully realized. These are intangibles, but nor are they imaginary factors; what technology gives, it can also take away.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button   is certainly curious—a modest F. Scott Fitzgerald  story, about a man born in the twilight of life and gradually regressing toward dawn, that has been adapted into a two-ton, Oscar-season white elephant. Directed by David Fincher  from a screenplay by Eric Roth , Benjamin Button  announces its epic intentions right from the start: An orchestra tunes up on the soundtrack; two studio logos appear, redesigned as button mosaics; and before you can say, "And the winner is . . . ," the movie fades in on a prosthetically aged Cate Blanchett  dying in a hospital bed. Unsurprisingly, the dying woman, who is called Daisy, asks her daughter (Julia Ormond ) to read to her from a diary—the contents of which, even less surprisingly, play out as decades-spanning flashbacks.
So we return to New Orleans, circa 1918, where the merriment attending the end of World War I is interrupted by the arrival of a baby boy (played, in a manner of speaking, by Brad Pitt ), who emerges from the womb looking like a midget Methuselah. His mother having died during his birth and his father terrified by the sight of him, the strange infant is swiftly deposited on the doorstep of an old folks' home. There, the childless, gold-hearted, Negro proprietress (Taraji P. Henson , though it could just as well be Butterfly McQueen ) christens the boy "Benjamin," and opts to raise him as her own.
We're already a long way from Fitzgerald, whose Benjamin Button came into the world not only looking like an old man, but having the body, wizened mind, and ornery temperament of one, too. But it's clear from the start that Roth and Fincher have considerably different aims. Closer in spirit to the Roth-scripted Forrest Gump  , Benjamin Button  is to the first half of the 20th century what Gump  was to the second—a panorama of the American experience as seen from the perspective of a wide-eyed Candide.
Here as there, Roth reduces our complex times to a parade of shockingly straight-faced kitsch: A hellfire-and-brimstone tent revivalist imbues Benjamin with the holy spirit; a pygmy lothario serves as his introduction to the outside world; and a drunken Irish tugboat captain shows him how to be a man. But where Gump  actively trivialized history, Benjamin Button  effectively ignores it: Although Benjamin briefly exchanges fire with a German submarine during World War II, and Hurricane Katrina  makes a cameo toward the end, this movie about a white baby raised by a black adoptive mother during the inglorious years of the Jim Crow South never so much as addresses race once.
The strived-for atmosphere is whimsical and picaresque, the results—save for Benjamin's brief dalliance with the coolly amused wife (Tilda Swinton ) of a British spy in Murmansk —mostly tedious. Very little about the first half of the film invites us in or gives inner life to the characters, leaving only the admittedly fascinating spectacle of seeing Pitt's computer-aged face digitally grafted on to the several pint-sized performers who help embody Benjamin over the first two decades of his existence. From a technological standpoint, this is rivaled only by the later "reverse aging" effects that convincingly restore Pitt to his Thelma & Louise –era visage and that should, if nothing else, establish Benjamin Button  as a cult film with the Botox  crowd.
The movie finally gives off a spark or two at exactly the midpoint, when Benjamin is reunited with ballet dancer Daisy (Blanchett, reverse-aged herself to resemble a twentysomething ingenue), whom he loved from afar as a boy, but can now see socially without causing a scandal. The trajectory is obvious, although Pitt and Blanchett surrender themselves to it with reasonable conviction: She's getting older while he's getting younger; eventually, they'll meet in the middle somewhere, but that too can not last. "Will you still love me when I have acne, when I wet the bed, when I'm afraid of what's under the stairs?" he asks her. But it speaks to the treacly nature of the entire film that most of the scenario's potential unpleasantries are carefully elided. Unlike Fitzgerald's Button, whose adolescence and eventual infancy bring with them a series of public and private humiliations, Roth and Fincher's Benjamin enters his second senescence in relative comfort, attended to by the ever-loyal Daisy and the oppressively emotive stirrings of composer Alexandre Desplat 's score. No bed-wetting is ever shown.
Perhaps it's no wonder, considering producers Kathleen Kennedy  and Frank Marshall  are longtime Steven Spielberg  associates, that one of Benjamin Button 's closest cinematic precursors is "Kick the Can," the Spielberg-directed segment of 1983's Twilight Zone: The Movie , in which the denizens of a retirement home briefly revert to their childhood selves, only to realize that, no matter what age you are, into every life some heartache must fall. There, the folk wisdom took a mere 30 minutes to dispense; here, it takes the better part of three hours, which is odd indeed for a movie so concerned with the preciousness of time.
It was just last year that Fincher delivered a great film, also three hours, on the subject of time. But whereas in Zodiac  the passing years wrap around the characters like a vise, catching them up obsessively in a single, distended moment, in Benjamin Button  the ravages of time are trumped by a kind of eternal, undying love that mere physics is at a loss to contain. And Fincher, try as he might, scarcely seems able to buy into Roth's brand of Harlequin-romance hokum. In order for Benjamin Button  to succeed on its own terms, there shouldn't be a dry eye left in the house. Yet, when the lights came up, mine were like sandpaper.
