To recap: This is fusillade No. 1 in Disney's presumed seven-film adaptation of C. S. Lewis' beloved children's tales, in which the four Pevensie children � tiny, hopeful Lucy (Henley); put-upon younger brother Edmund (Keynes); sweet, maternal Susan (Popplewell); and brave lad Peter (Moseley) � are sent by their mother to the English countryside to escape the German Blitz. There they encounter a magical wardrobe that functions as the portal to the miraculous land of Narnia, currently ruled by the White Witch (Swinton, costumed in a decidedly unwitchy outfit that makes her look like a cross between the Pillsbury Doughboy and Bj�rk on Oscar night). The White Witch is a vicious, thoroughly evil character intent on enslaving the more sun-dappled areas of Narnia, currently held by the wise and noble lion Aslan (voiced with appropriate solemnity by Neeson). My question is, if all the fauna, and even the flora, in the fantasy world of Narnia are sentient, what on earth (or, you know, wherever) does anyone eat? If I recall my C.S. Lewis, he didn't bother with the digestive systems of his characters either, so director Adamson (Shrek)
 and his co-screenwriters Ann Peacock, Christopher Markus, and Stephen McFeely are apparently off the hook. Still, the whole issue of food and the lack thereof left me feeling a bit peckish. There's much to dine on visually, as you'd expect from a reported $150 million Disney outing, but the fact of the matter – whether you fell in love with the seven Narnia
 books as a child or not � is that $150 million big ones no longer seem to add up to very convincing special effects, and in a world populated by a hodge-podge of mythic beasties ranging from centaurs to satyrs (here called fauns) and from the legendary flaming Phoenix to Aslan, the talking lion and
 Lewis' four-legged metaphorical Christ figure, that's a huge problem. Shots of the Pevensie girls riding atop Aslan's bunching and tawny musculature look as phony as the traveling mattes of RKO yore, and many members of the White Witch's ogre-inclusive army appear to be sporting nothing more than cheap latex masks. Did all the talented effects mavens in this film's home base of New Zealand end up in Peter Jackson's pocket already? It would appear so. (Kong
 triumphs yet again.) The film's rapid, almost video-game sense of narrative (and I don't recall the books having this problem) means it leaps and cavorts from serious situation to very
 serious situation like a Super Mario Jesus leaping over the waters. There's no sense of calm before the gathering storm because the film is all
 storm, and so when the thunderheads of the White Witch finally crash down atop the outnumbered army of Aslan, it comes almost as an afterthought: oh, yes, the battle
. We'd almost forgot. Pacing and dodgy CGI work aside, Narnia
 is nearly saved by those immensely likable and altogether stiff-upper-lippy Pevensie kids. Moseley's pre-King Peter, in particular, and wee Henley, all doe-eyed, gape-mouthed wonderment, are more real than anything else on the screen. Their inter-sibling battles, presaging the "real" thing later in the film, have a ring of truth to them that Frodo would kill for. But still, as a broadside across the bow of Lord Jackson and his rampaging WETAns, this is a puny shot. And I'm still hungry.


Take a deep breath and relax. Aslan doesn't spout blood from his paws or perform the miracle of the loaves and (talking) fishes. Nor have the Pevensie children been outfitted with iPods and Big Gulps in an attempt to woo the Nickelodeon demographic.
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe -- the first in what production partners Disney and Walden Media pray will be an ongoing franchise -- arrives as a solid, reasonably close cinematic approximation of C.S. Lewis's beloved children's book.
As expected, it's bigger, louder, rather more bruising, and entwined with the computer-generated DNA of Peter Jackson's "The Lord of the Rings." The nabobs of Hollywood wouldn't be doing their job if it weren't, so those of us who prefer the slenderness of Lewis's originals -- his donnish aversion to overstatement -- will have to eat our popcorn and bear it. The filmmakers make many compromises in the name of epic scope and box office appeal, but they can't bend this story out of shape, and they have Tilda Swinton on hand to spank anyone who tries.
For those who still have no idea what this means: "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" was the first of seven books about an alternate universe called Narnia, into which children of our world occasionally stumble. Animals talk, centaurs and satyrs romp, and a magnificent, all-powerful lion named Aslan pads through dispensing deeper meaning.
Lewis, a philosopher, writer, and Oxford professor who wrote the books during the post-WWII era, intended them as Christian allegory, but they don't have to be read that way -- they work equally well as secular stories of sacrifice and courage, and they're terrific fantasy novels in the bargain.
"Chronicles" the movie puts its eggs in the latter basket, with added muscle. It opens not on a rainy, bored Saturday but with the bombs of the London Blitz sending the four Pevensies fleeing to a backyard shelter: Peter the eldest (William Moseley), Susan the priss (Anna Popplewell), Edmund the sour (Skandar Keynes), and Lucy the big-eyed and indomitable (Georgie Henley). Their mother packs them off in a teary farewell scene to a distant country relative (Jim Broadbent, eccentrically bewigged), and only after establishing their isolation and fractious sibling rivalry does Lucy idly wander into that wardrobe. . .
And pops out into the snow, a half-naked faun named Tumnus (James McAvoy) looking at her queerly. Aside from its genteel borderline kink, that first Narnia sequence sets the tone for what follows: wondrous immersion in a hyper-realistic otherworld that's just a little chintzy around the edges. When Edmund follows later on, a dyspeptic viewer may notice the fake snow that clings to his clothes and never melts, or the fact that Mr. Tumnus's ears don't move, or the unconvincing digital matte-work in later scenes. The movie's seams show.
Against that are Aslan and -- the film's most terrifying special effect -- Swinton as Jadis, the White Witch and reigning Queen of Narnia. Eventually all the children make it over, whereupon they meet a doughty pair of beavers (Ray Winstone and Dawn French providing warm tea-cozy voices; the digital effects are especially fine here) who tell them about a centuries-old prophecy of four humans who will free the realm from Jadis's icy grip.
Now we come to a problem the movie never quite solves. When you read C.S. Lewis, it's easy to make the leap of literary faith and believe that children are capable of epic treks and feats; the book is about their finding the inner strength to do so. "Chronicles" the movie gives us a flesh-and-blood Peter wielding a massive sword, and whether Moseley, a pleasant enough young chap, doesn't have the requisite charisma or whether director Andrew Adamson feels more comfortable around the CGI critters of "Shrek" than around humans, the film's flesh and fantasy never convincingly combine. At times you may even be moved to laughter, which is more destructive to Narnia than anything Jadis can dole out.
Swinton compensates by giving the ice queen the eyes of a fanatic and a cold interest in cruelty. "Chronicles" sticks a silly plastic ice-crown atop her head in the opening scenes, but it melts away soon enough and by the end she's an Amazonian berserker pinwheeling through the fight scenes with joy. Behind all of Lewis's games, the "Narnia" books are about the conflict between civilization and chaos. Swinton, as she has done elsewhere, makes an unsettlingly good case for chaos.
For his part, Aslan has tawny fur that blows with the gentleness of a computer-generated wheat field, eyes that are liquid and human and -- here's a surprise -- the mellifluous voice of Liam Neeson. Personally, I want more of a basso profundo rumble out of my Aslan, but Neeson is 
regal, and the character's sacrifice atop the Stone Table, with Lucy and Susan as witnesses, is appropriately awful.
Adamson is very, very careful to stick to the tone of the book here -- as in Lewis, we bring whatever overlay of crucifixion and resurrection we choose to (or not) -- and only at the end of the final battle does he allow Aslan to say "It is finished," as though throwing a toe-bone to Christian fundamentalists in the audience. The cultural dissonance between a property that can be sold to post-"Passion of the Christ" religious groups and ruthlessly merchandised in the usual commercial ways remains offscreen. Whether you want to pray to your plastic Hasbro
 Aslan figurine is up to you.
Anyway, the true deity in this movie is Peter Jackson. "Chronicles of Narnia" is very much "The Lord of the Rings" rebuilt to PG specifications, which services the box office at the expense of C.S. Lewis. It also cheats the youngest readers of an intense little story of moral ideas. A gracefully subtle metaphor about life's Deep Magic has become a war film; what was a one-chapter battle toward the end of the book is now a ripsnorting Armageddon that looks like something Hieronymus Bosch might dream up after a heavy meal.
Not for the under-8 crowd, then. Older kids and many adults will find "Chronicles" suitable enough, with moments of real glory intermixed with awkwardness. The movie lacks the inspired casting of the "Harry Potter" movies, though -- Henley as the grave, plucky Lucy makes the most lasting impression -- as well as the inarguable rightness of Jackson's "Rings." The worst that can be said about it is that you don't come away thirsting to see the next installment as soon as possible, and that Lewis's larger cosmology remains blurry. Is Narnia necessary? You'll just have to take it on faith.


         There are several things to be grateful for in Disney's adaptation of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," which, considering how beloved the source, comes as a relief. Most people who read the C.S. Lewis series as kids recall it with a fierce and proprietary fondness. But aside from an added prologue that kicks off the story in London and helps to ground it in a reality against which to contrast the fantasy to come, the movie remains faithful to the book in both tone and imagery. As soon as I finish this, I'll be sending thank-you notes to whomever it was that managed to avoid conforming to nervous marketers' notions of what "the kids" are into these days. Rather unbelievably — but oh so felicitously — Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell), Edmund (Skandar Keynes) and Lucy (Georgie Henley) have made it onto the screen as British children (accents and all) who haven't been remotely coolified. They're starchy, polite, dressed in boiled wool and excited at the prospect of sardines on toast.
 
  Some evangelical groups have been promoting the movie as " 'The Passion' for kids," which makes it sound potentially like a greater source of lifelong trauma than "Bambi." But the Christian allegory embedded at its chewy center serves less as evangelical cudgel than a primer on morality and the myths we create to explain it. The magical land of Narnia is a place where Western myths and religions (classical, Christian, Celtic, Norse, you name it) are jumbled together so that we may consider their similarities and uses. If it weren't for Lewis' stated intention to write a fantastical story to make the dogma go down, it might even come across as a liberal humanist parable about myth and its function in society, especially during times of trouble.
 


         






    Directed by Andrew Adamson, who reminds us of his pedigree with visual allusions to "Shrek" (the giants look mighty familiar), "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" is the kind of story kids love for all the age-old reasons. It features a quartet of pseudo-orphaned London children living more or less on their own in a rambling, comfortable setting (dad is off fighting the war, mum has shipped them to the country during the Blitz), who discover a portal into an alternate universe ruled by magic.
 
  Sent to live with an absent-minded professor (Jim Broadbent) and his grim housekeeper on an old country estate full of forgotten rooms and mysterious furniture, the children discover, one by one, that the wardrobe in the spare room leads to a land called Narnia, where, according to a prophesy, they are to inherit the throne with the help of a messianic lion named Aslan.
 
  Lucy is the first to discover Narnia when she hides in the wardrobe during a game of hide-and-seek. Emerging from the row of coats into a snow-covered wood, she encounters a friendly faun named Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), who invites her over for tea. There, he fills her in on the political situation and chickens out on his intended plan: The White Witch, a dreadlocked ice queen played by Tilda Swinton, has cursed Narnia, making it always winter and never Christmas, and has instructed its inhabitants to turn over any human child to her for execution.
 
  Next through the wardrobe is naughty Edmund, who runs into the White Witch and is lured into her camp with ample helpings of Turkish delight, which I'm told is a popular confection in England but, to an American reader in the early 1980s, sounded pretty exotic and possibly illicit. In any case, what Edmund gets is a sweet so intoxicating that it makes the boy sell out his siblings for another taste. Edmund gets hooked and spills the Aslan-related beans. When the four children find their way to Narnia soon afterward, Edmund is abducted, and Peter, Susan and Lucy team up with Aslan and his followers to save Edmund and take back the kingdom.
 
  Narnia is a fantasy universe, featuring talking beavers, solicitous fauns, evil wolves and more chain mail and velvet than a Renaissance fair. Visually, the film stays remarkably true to the book's simple illustrations by Pauline Baynes and at the same time comes to life in a spectacularly realistic fashion. The inhabitants of Narnia run the gamut from humble rodent to mythical man-beast, and all but one (the Disneyish fox, who has eyes like shooter marbles and a smiley snout) could pass for real until they open their mouths to speak. You get the sense the paint hasn't yet dried on the technology. It's a magical world without the annoying pixie-dust "magical" tropes that make so many children's movies an exercise in condescension. What's best about it is that it seems real by the logic of childhood — it looks as things should 
look, if kids had it their way.
 
  It's also governed by a child's idea of a perfect society — one that's as democratic as it is mythically hierarchical, black and white as it is idealized. Mythical creatures peaceably coexist elbow-to-hoof with woodland animals, jungle cats and humanoids in chain mail in defiance of every natural, mythical and geographical law there is. Santa Claus, witches, talking animals and a furry, benevolent Jesus figure exist on a single plane. If a scene featuring the torment and grisly execution of Aslan is meant to recall the crucifixion (the lion is eventually resurrected, thanks to the rules of the "deep magic" that governs Narnia), the other stuff cancels it out. That is, unless Christianity has lately been amended to allow for the Christ figure in pitched battle against a witch, a Minotaur and evil dwarfs (the centaur, the faun and flying wildcats are on his side), which, these days, you never know.
 
  None of it would work so well if the children, especially Lucy and Edmund, weren't such delightfully down-to-earth types. Henley and Keynes stand out as characters who've somehow avoided being processed through the Hollywood filter of how children behave. A buck-toothed imp with a wonderfully expressive face, Henley is a marvel of assurance and charm. And Keynes, as the surly and haughty Edmund, is a perfect foil. As Peter and Susan, Moseley and Popplewell suffer from Lewis' impoverished view of grown-up boys and girls. Peter is a bit of a sap and Susan a nagging pessimist lacking in courage and conviction, a wet blanket whose moniker ends up being the flabby "Queen Susan the Gentle."
 
  As the children gain ground against the witch, Narnia begins to thaw, and a pre-Coca-Cola St. Nick returns to hand out gifts — a sword for Peter, a bow and arrow for Susan, a dagger for Lucy. The story climaxes with a scary battle scene. No wonder that some might take it as religious instruction: It's a medieval vision of Christianity for another dark age, with the Christ figure as soldier and war as the way to make the world safe for Santa Claus. As a Christian primer, it's terrible. As a story, it's timeless.   

Alice, down the rabbit hole, tumbled into a Wonderland of vanity and vice  the real world etched in satirical acid  and her early-20th-century American counterpart, Dorothy, found Oz, with its surreal yokels and charlatans, to be just as crackpot a place. But when C.S. Lewis wrote his own variation on rabbit hole metaphysics, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe , in which he dispatched four very proper British children into the haunted and mystical winterland of Narnia, he wasn't fooling around, or even cracking a smile. You can read the seven volumes of The Chronicles of Narnia  as a Christian allegory or as an ornate book of wonder (or both), but either way it's marked by the devout, almost pristine earnestness of Lewis' sincerity and gravitas. Narnia, a land of fauns, talking beavers, a dastardly White Witch, and a solemn savior of a lion, may sound like the stuff of filigreed fairy tales, but it's really a place of holy war, where the imagination darkens the more it expands.
In the lavish, spirited, at times naggingly literal-minded movie version of the hugely popular first Narnia  tale, you're often aware that you're watching child actors romp through a land of concocted creatures and special effects. The snow is too studio-set frosty, and Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French as an engaging pair of fussbudgets, come a little too close to the goofy polar bears in Coke commercials; you can see the digital seams. The centaurs, satyrs, and assorted other magic folk of the wood often look as if they'd just stepped out of a makeup trailer. Director Andrew Adamson, in his live-action debut (after Shrek  and Shrek 2 ), stages The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe  with a wide-eyed prosaic eagerness that reminds me a little of the Hollywood fantasy films of the late '60s. Even when Adamson brings off a lovely touch, such as the White Witch (Tilda Swinton) tempting young Edmund (Skandar Keynes) by creating ice sculptures that turn into fruit-filled Turkish Delight, we don't quite feel how the devilish dessert has corrupted the boy's heart.
Yet the movie, for all its half-baked visual marvels, remains remarkably faithful to Lewis' story, and the innocence of his passion begins to shine through. It's there, most spectacularly, in Aslan, the lion-king messiah. For once, a computerized beast looks like he's talking, and he's voiced, by Liam Neeson, in velvet seductive tones of lordly compassion. Swinton, as the White Witch, makes a worthy enemy, rearing up during the climactic battle like a rock star of cold self-love. The war itself, with its digital tumult, will look familiar to anyone who saw the Lord of the Rings  films, but if Peter Jackson did it better, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe,  by summoning C.S. Lewis' spirit, creates a different kind of spectacle  a starry-eyed crusade.

 In the weeks leading up to the release of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," the entertainment press has sometimes seemed so preoccupied with matters of allegory as to resemble an advanced seminar in Renaissance literature.  It has never been a secret that C. S. Lewis, who taught that subject and others at Oxford for many years, composed his great cycle of seven children's fantasy novels with the New Testament in mind and with some of the literary traditions it inspired close at hand. To the millions since the 1950's for whom the books have been a source of childhood enchantment, Lewis's religious intentions have either been obvious, invisible or beside the point.  Which is part of the appeal of allegory, as he well knew. It is a symbolic mode, not a literal one - there are, after all, no talking beavers in the Bible - and it constructs distinct levels of meaning among which readers travel of their own free will. An allegorical world is both a reflection of the real one and a reality unto itself, as Lewis's heroes, the four Pevensie children, come to discover. The story of Aslan's sacrifice and resurrection may remind some readers (and now viewers) of what they learned in Sunday school, but others, Christian or not, will be perfectly happy to let what happens in Narnia stay in Narnia.  The supposed controversy over the religious content of "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" may be overhyped, but a particular question of faith nonetheless hovers around the movie, which was produced by Walden Media and distributed by Disney. Anyone who grew up with the Narnia books  is likely to be concerned less with Lewis's beliefs than with the filmmakers' fidelity to his work, which was idiosyncratic and imperfect in ways that may not easily lend themselves to appropriation by the shiny and hyperkinetic machinery of mass visual fantasy. But if a few liberties have been taken here and there, as is inevitable in the transition from page to screen, the spirit of the book is very much intact.  The movie, directed by Andrew Adamson, does not achieve the sublimity of, say, Peter Jackson's "Lord of the Rings" trilogy (which had the advantage of working from a richer allegory by an even more learned Oxford don), but it does use available technology to capture both the mythic power of Lewis's tale and, even better, its charm.  Mr. Adamson, who directed the rambunctious "Shrek" movies at DreamWorks, has nicely adjusted to the technical demands of mixing live action with computer-generated imagery. He also manages a less jokey, more earnest tone and temperament. Stocked with an estimable cast of actors  - some doing voice-over, some appearing in wild costumes - "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" suggests that, at least in Hollywood, there is no such thing as too much Englishness. British children are especially prized, and little Georgie Henley, who plays Lucy, the youngest of the Pevensie children and the first to discover Narnia, is both winsome and indomitable, with a wide smile and a priceless accent (though not quite the same one as that of the actors playing her siblings).  Lucy is sent off to the countryside to escape the Blitz, along with Peter (William Moseley), Susan (Anna Popplewell) and Edmund (Skandar Keynes), a fact mentioned in passing by Lewis and given more thorough treatment here. The opening sequence - German bombs falling on London neighborhoods, sowing panic and destruction - is a premonition of the climactic battle in Narnia, and also a reminder that the war between good and evil is not merely a metaphorical conceit. Exiled to the home of an eccentric scholar (Jim Broadbent) and his stern housekeeper (Elizabeth Hawthorne), the children spend their time playing and squabbling, during which the essential aspects of their characters emerge.  Lucy and Peter, the eldest, are the more virtuous, while Edmund and Susan have darker, more complicated personalities (as well as fuller lips). Edmund has a penchant for dishonesty and a weakness for sweets, which both make him susceptible to the chilly lure of the White Witch (a terrifying Tilda Swinton), whose rule has turned Narnia into a land of perpetual winter, where fauns are tortured and turned to stone, and a secret police force of wolves harshly deals with rebels and traitors.  Narnia's onscreen incarnation is credible enough. Talking-animal technology has made impressive strides lately, and most of the minotaurs, foxes and other creatures share the screen comfortably with the humans. Aslan, the noble lion who commands the fight against the White Witch, shows up late, looks fabulous and speaks in the mellow voice of Alfred Kinsey - that is, of Liam Neeson. The homey, chattering beavers, who provide comic byplay as well as a  picture of shopkeeper steadfastness, are voiced by Ray Winstone and Dawn French. As the Pevensie children journey deeper into Narnia, the movie's scope widens and its dramatic intensity grows, a transition from intimacy to grandeur that is beautifully handled, without too many dead spots or digressions.  Parents should take note: the battle scenes, though bloodless, are more brutal than a PG rating  would usually permit, and the death of Aslan may prove overwhelming to younger children. But the somber, scary aspects of the story are inseparable from its magic, which in the end may work only indirectly on adults.  For me, the best moments in the film take place in the wardrobe itself, which serves as a portal between England and Narnia. When the children pass through it for the first time, I felt  a welcome tremor of apprehension and anticipation as the wooden floor turned into snowy ground and fur coats gave way to fir trees. The next two hours might not  have quite delivered on that initial promise of wonder - we grown-ups, being heavy, are not so easily swept away by visual tricks -  except when I looked away from the screen at the faces of breathless and wide-eyed children, my own among them, for whom the whole experience was new, strange, disturbing and delightful.  "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe" is rated PG. It has some kinetically violent - though not especially gory - battle scenes, and the temporary deaths of several sympathetic characters.

The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe

  By 
TODD MCCARTHY

    
 
 
 
Now that J.R.R. Tolkien's reign as box-office king among dead Oxford fantasy authors has run its course, old colleague C. S. Lewis is being nominated as his successor with "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe." Not nearly as imposing as "The Lord of the Rings" as mythology, drama or literature, Lewis' series of seven modest-length books has nevertheless been popular since "Lion" first appeared in 1950. Just coincidentally, it also provides the opportunity for the sorts of extravagant computerized effects that create tentpole movie attractions these days. While "Rings"-level B.O. totals won't be matched, there's little doubt Disney's massive marketing push in the service of a competently made film that appeals to all demographics will be banking money from this one for the indefinite future.
Unlike the much more demanding and young-adult-oriented "Rings" cycle, Lewis' tomes are geared toward children. To many adults, they can seem simplistic, somewhat derivative and downright odd if analyzed as Christian fable or metaphor. "Lion" functions best as a "Wizard of Oz"-like trip, an expression of innocent, parent-deprived children's imaginative escape from dreary reality into an exquisite but perilous world of starkly personified good and evil dominated by animals, human-like characters and a witch. Like "Oz," it similarly ends with the leads' confounding decision to return to that dull reality rather than to stay in a wondrous land where they are regarded as heroes and royalty.
Like Peter Jackson's "Rings" trilogy, "The Lion" is presented -- by famously family-friendly producer Mark Johnson along with Philip Steuer -- on a gargantuan scale, and to a great extent on New Zealand locations. What it lacks in complexity, distinguished Anglo-Aussie-Yank thespians and transcendent screen magic it somewhat compensates for by way of the strong casting of mostly unfamiliar faces, a convincing family feeling among the four kids, solid storytelling and fluid interplay between the humans and four-legged creatures; as in "Shrek," director Andrew Adamson displays an equal opportunity attitude toward all critters, human or otherwise.
Escaping one war zone merely to find another, siblings Peter, Susan, Edmund and little Lucy are spirited out of London during the blitz by their mother to the calm of a distant country estate inhabited by the Professor (Jim Broadbent). During a game of hide-and-seek, Lucy (Georgie Henley) ducks into a large wardrobe, only to find herself transported into a wintery forest where she meets a faun, Mr. Tumnus (James McAvoy), a half-man, half-goat who expresses wonder at the arrival of a girl he calls the "daughter of Eve" and invites her to his cozy abode.
Big-eyed, snub-nosed and pleasantly plump, Henley conveys a contagious curiosity that makes her an ideal conduit for the wonderment one is meant to feel in this new world. It falls to the faun to explain that Narnia is ruled by a terrible queen, the White Witch, who keeps the land in eternal winter and has prevented Christmas from coming for 100 years. Although the queen has decreed that any human found in Narnia must be delivered straight to her, Mr. Tumnus lets her go.
On Lucy's second trip through the wardrobe, she is followed by doubting brother Edmund (Skandar Keynes, very good at skepticism and incipient mischief), who is promptly found by the queen (the ideally cast Tilda Swinton) and seduced into believing he will be made a prince and, eventually, the king of Narnia if he brings his siblings back with him. 
Pic's central adventure starts at the 40-minute mark, as Lucy and Edmund are joined by older Peter (William Moseley) and Susan (Anna Popplewell) to wander around the forest until being taken in by Mr. and Mrs. Beaver, Cockney-accented computer animated critters who regale them with news of the imminent arrival of the great leonine savior Aslan. And a savior they will need, as disgruntled Edmund has slipped away to see the queen, only to be thrown into a frigid cell along with the faun.
Informed of the interlopers' arrival, the witch dispatches her flying monkeys ... errr, marauding wolves ... to intercept them. The film's most brilliantly animated creatures, the wolves feature in two or three scary scenes that, along with some violent battle moments, push the film to, and perhaps beyond, the invisible line between PG and PG-13 territory; simply put, unprepared smallfry may get more than they can handle. 
With the entrance of the Lion King ... errr, Aslan ... the enterprise is endowed with a gravitas that lends the drama moral purpose and inspires the hitherto peaceable and arguably wimpy English kids to advanced levels militaristic determinism. As voiced with ringingly noble Irish-Anglo clarity by Liam Neeson, Aslan is prone -- as a well-known wizard once said -- to think deep thoughts.
His uncanny ability to say and do the right thing extends to realms that mortal men and beasts can't comprehend when he makes a private deal with the queen that entails sacrificing himself for the greater good.
This scene, staged as an act of ancient ritual that Mel Gibson would appreciate, is another that the impressionable may find tough to watch, as it is for Susan and Lucy, who have accompanied Aslan on his fateful journey. The lion's eventual resurrection is crucial to the Christian overlay in Lewis' work, and while this element may help "Lion" lure Gibson's passionate audience to untold upward B.O. effect, the film does not stress its religious parallels.
Pic's credibility hinges as much on the visualization of the lion as on anything else. Compared with the wolves, the imposing Aslan looks somewhat less lifelike at first; his expressions seem a bit posed and the waviness of his mane and other hair isn't entirely naturalistic. But one soon accepts him, as his movements carry a deliberate composure and Neeson's sonorous readings convey a steady dignity.
Climactic battle, the scale of which has rather more to do with "The Lord of the Rings" than with anything in Lewis' text, is marked not only by its spectacle but by its unique constituency; both sides are populated not only by recognizable members of the animal kingdom but by creatures of unfathomable origin, combination man-beasts divided by the beautiful (on Aslan's side) and the repugnant (the queen's minions). 
Good triumphs, of course, and an end-credits insert leaves the wardrobe door wide open for a sequel, as Lucy asks the Professor, "Will we ever go back?" to which he replies, "I expect so."
Although there are a few obvious process shots and telltale painted backdrops, the film's design elements and special and visual effects are mostly impressive; seemingly the only thing the tech maestros couldn't pull off is making the characters' breath visible in the mostly winter settings.
Combined efforts of production designer Roger Ford, costume designer Isis Mussenden, visual effects supervisor Dean Wright, creature and visual concept designer Richard Taylor, special makeup and creatures creators Howard Berger and Gregory Nicotero and an array of supporting craftspeople pull the viewer into a credible alternative world, even if the film itself is more prosaic than inspiring.
The kids work well together, although the more upright personalities of the older siblings prevent Moseley and Popplewell from being as entertaining as are Henley and Keynes. As white as a vampire, Swinton leavens her icy queen with nary a whit of vulnerability, while McAvoy invests the faun with welcome nuances of character. James Cosmo brings a robust humanity to his cameo as Father Christmas, whose arrival in Narnia portends the end of the queen's rule.
Harry Gregson-Williams' score brings helpful vigor to the enterprise, which, in addition to New Zealand, was partially shot in Poland, the Czech Republic, England and Guatemala.

Its title a verbal freight train, The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe  pulls into the 'plexes bearing a heavy burden of dreams. You're not buying a ticket to Narnia  but investing in the future of a prospective franchise.
To revive its fortunes, Walt Disney Enterprises  has hired its foremost tormenterShrek   director Andrew Adamson to engineer a showy ideological volte-face. More than once attacked by religious fundamentalists for flagrant Mouse-worship and sinful secular humanism, Disney  has hitched its wagon to the locomotive of C.S. Lewis 's seven-volume Christian allegory. The announced $180 million tab has been partially underwritten by multi-billionaire media mogul Philip Anschutz , big-time Bush supporter and public proponent of socially conservative entertainment.
Anschutz can break out the near beer (so long as it's Coors). Robust, engrossing, and surprisingly restrained in saving most of its effects for the grand finale, the first Chronicles of Narnia  installment eschews Harry Potter 's satanic subtext and The Lord of the Rings ' Wagnerian cosmology. It may be as close to adult-friendly kid fare as Hollywood  will ever getalthough that has more to do with narrative than family values. (Having read both Tolkien and Lewis aloud at bedtime, I can attest to the latter's superiority as a storyteller.)
Just how Christian is it? Visiting the land of Narnia as a young heathen, I found Lewis's theology an only mildly obtrusive part of the landscape. Even for me, it was easy to see that Aslan was a furry, if fearsome, Jesusalthough being a child myself, I missed the theological significance of little Lucy's faith. (Or maybe not: I was sufficiently smitten to write Lewis my first and only fan letter.) For kids weaned on Shrek , however, the big problem may be less the toned-down violence than the absence of pop culture references. One has to supply one's own anachronisms. Mr. Tumnus the faun has been preempted by Matthew Barney 's goat-boy, while the password "Aslan is on the move" seems inspired by the presidential mantra that "freedom is on the march."
The Christianity may be too New Age to make good 700 Club   fodder. On the other hand, The Lion et al.  could serve as a powerful teaching story: the gospel according to Tumnus. Certainly, the Boschian "crucifixion" that Aslan suffers has to be friendlier than Mel Gibson 's Jew-baiting sadomasochist extravaganza. Anyway, for all the Lion 's blatant allegory, the tale's engagingly child-centered family dynamics will most likely be understood as a cosmic divorce settlement pitting Aslan's cuddly dad against the White Witch's castrating mommy.
We know who we "love," but so far as acting goes, there's no comparison between the computer-spawned lion king, whose chewy lines are masticated by Liam Neeson , and Tilda Swinton 's Method ice queen. Swinton must have a sense memory of hypothermia. Projecting cold amusement, chilly exasperation, and arctic fury as the situation requires, coolly acting against a cast of kids, fuzzy puppets, and nonexistent CGI hobgoblins, Swinton is, in Narnia-speak, a true Daughter of Eveshe may be scary but her performance is a triumph of the human.
