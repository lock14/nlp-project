The values of competence seem greater during dire movie seasons. "Flawless," a diamond heist flick set in 1960 London, isn't close to the best film I'll see this year, but it's assured and neatly crafted - the time zips by while you're watching it.
The director is Michael Radford, who has solid, literate work like "1984," "White Mischief," and "Il Postino" on his ledger. Next to them, "Flawless" is a gimcrack, a genre exercise, yet it's a confidence game in the best sense of the phrase. Radford knows the rules - when to bend them, when to break them, and when to play by them. That's an increasingly rare skill.
All this and Demi Moore giving a good performance. She plays Laura Quinn, an American-born, Oxford-educated executive at the all-powerful London Diamond Corporation who's so sick of being passed over for promotion that she goes in on a robbery plot with a cagey night janitor named Hobbs (Michael Caine).
All right, that's disingenuous: Moore's really playing Joan Crawford circa 1952. The rectilinear shoulders, the tight-lipped intensity, the absence of any sense of irony whatsoever - it's all there, and it works. Moore has always been an actress of limited range (to put it kindly), but every so often she gets handed a role within those limits and she bats it out of the park. (That said, if she ever puts on blackface like Crawford did in "Torch Song," it's probably time to call it a day.)
So it is here. Laura has hit the glass ceiling, and all around her are smirking, titled old farts who resent her gender and her classless roots. The chairman of London Diamond is Sir Milton Ashtoncroft (Joss Ackland), the visual equivalent of a harrumph; his chief insurer is a scoundrel named Sinclair (Derren Nesbitt). Both are ripe for the plucking, and "Flawless" takes pains to remind us that no one's innocent in the international diamond trade, least of all the men at the top.
Hobbs, by contrast, skulks around at the bottom, invisible to the executives whose wastebins he empties - of course he should rob the place. Caine makes him a shabby little man with a shabby little smile, baiting the trap for Laura with finesse. Just a few diamonds from the vault during evening cleanup, he says. They won't be missed and we'll be rich.
Radford and screenwriter Edward Anderson have a bit of fun when the company installs newfangled video security cameras and forces the pair to rethink their plans; the ensuing close-ups of VTR screens and ticking clocks are straight out of an old "Mission: Impossible" episode. Yet because the setup is simple and, on the movie's terms, believable, we go along for the ride.
At a certain critical juncture, Hobbs changes the nature of the game, and Laura is forced to play to both sides of the room. I'll say no more other than to note that "Flawless" takes a goofy, baroque risk with the appearance of Finch (Lambert Wilson), the insurance company's chief investigator and a proto-metrosexual who inwardly swoons whenever he sees Laura. (I'm not sure what turns him on more, her guilt or her shoulder pads.)
At this point, Radford's clearly riffing on old Hollywood women's pictures - if this were 1952, Finch would be played by Paul Henreid - but the heist subplot keeps twisting along, and there's a tablespoon of "The Third Man" in there too. Caine has dealt with mulligan stews like this plenty of times, and he serves it up like a professional. When Hobbs's true motivations are finally made clear, the pieces fit together with a satisfying, almost audible snap.
Because this is all tosh, really - we know it, Radford knows it, Caine knows it (Moore doesn't) - "Flawless" is swaddled in pleasurable craftsmanship. Richard Greatrex's cinematography and Sophie Becher's production design gleam with hints of Swinging London on the horizon, and the Dave Brubeck Quartet's "Take Five" fills the soundtrack, Paul Desmond's sax solo seducing Laura into daydreams of ill-gotten lucre.
The one flaw of "Flawless," in fact, is that Moore never conveys the thrill of what Laura's doing - the dirty, liberating eroticism of theft. I'm not sure she has the acting chops. The star strides through this nonsense without once cracking a smile, the strain of keeping the plot straight in her head apparently giving her ulcers. She's the only person here not having a good time.


Flawless  is about a swingin' 1960 heist at a formidable, fictional London diamond company, with a title meant to invoke both the quality of the gems and that of the escapade. I can't vouch for the clarity of the stones, and the movie itself, directed by Il Postino 's Michael Radford, is exceedingly cloudy  Michael Caine goes dependably Cockney as a wily old janitor with a grievance who knows an awful lot about company business and has remarkably free access to empty hallways after hours. But as Laura Quinn, the one female company exec, Demi Moore sports an impeccable period wardrobe, coiffure, red lips, and lacquered nails. She smokes beautifully, the way people were allowed to in the good old, bad old Mad Men  era now fetishized in fashion and decor magazines, and her high-heeled pumps clack gracefully across polished floors while men   address her formally as ''Miss Quinn.'' In the ritualistic way of a fable dully retrofitted to instruct today's audiences about past socioeconomic wrongs, she has sacrificed marriage for a career, and she chokes on bitterness as she is repeatedly passed over for promotion. Also, the diamonds are dulled with the shame of African exploitation.
It's left to Caine to wink and nod at his own contribution to real caper classics of the 1960s and '70s, produced with more emphasis on fun and less on instructive fact-finding.

 “Flawless” is a mildly diverting period heist movie in which an odd couple conspire to loot an  evil London diamond company, for which they both work. In the story, set in 1960, before the term glass ceiling was coined,  Demi Moore plays Laura Quinn, a grimly ambitious company executive of 40 whose career has stalled. Early in the movie she learns that the pompous, corrupt gargoyles who stole her ideas intend to fire her.  An Oxford-educated American with a  British-American accent, Ms. Moore’s Laura is a forerunner of Meredith Johnson, the barracuda she played with such fearsome intensity in “Disclosure.” Where Meredith wielded sexual harassment charges as a weapon for career advancement, Laura has no tools with which to fight. The world of “Flawless” predates the very  expression sexual harassment. Steely in mind and body, this apparently loveless, friendless woman has sacrificed everything for success in business.  Her unlikely partner in crime, Mr. Hobbs (Michael Caine, in a role he has played before), is the company’s sneaky janitor. Abjectly shuffling through the corridors with his pail and mop, Hobbs, who lost his wife to cancer 15 years earlier, is such a harmless-looking creature that he is able to steal virtually unnoticed into executive suites and rifle through personnel files. But as we eventually learn, he has a serious personal ax to grind. Hobbs is the one who discovers that Laura’s days at the company are numbered, and he uses the information to enlist her in a robbery scheme.  The movie, directed by Michael Radford (“Il Postino”) from a screenplay by Edward A. Anderson, works at cross-purposes. It wants to transport us  to the innocent, carefree days of traditional British caper movies in the Age of Bond, when the game was the thing. But since the product being marketed is diamonds mined in South Africa, it also feels obliged to tip its hat to the Age of “Blood Diamond”  and affect a political consciousness.  We hear of a riot by striking miners in which many were killed. But that information has no resonance. It is just another signal that the London company is rotten to the core.  During its first third “Flawless” ticks along like an inexpensive watch. Hobbs approaches Laura to get the codes to the vault holding the diamonds. In a last-minute glitch the company installs a  surveillance cameras. But Hobbs finds a solution, and the crime’s execution is reasonably suspenseful.  It is only after the robbery that “Flawless” becomes more complicated and unpredictable. The bosses fight among themselves about whether to pay a ransom, and the thieves come under the scrutiny  of a suave insurance investigator, Finch (Lambert Wilson), who shows a slight romantic interest in Laura, whose relationship with Hobbs ruptures. None of it makes much sense. In an extra, unnecessary layer, “Flawless” is told as a flashback in which the aged Laura brings her story to a magazine editor.  The movie’s strongest moment is the opening sequence of hands foraging for diamonds in a muddy stream and coming up with a rock that is chiseled, sanded and polished into a 168-carat monster stone with 58 facets. The scene reminds us that diamond dealing begins with dirty hands scrounging in the muck.  “Flawless” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

It may not live up to its title, but as a polished and lustrous exercise in '60s nostalgia, "Flawless" holds its value. A heist movie that pits Michael Caine, ironically reprising his own work in that genre, opposite Demi Moore -- here an ambitious businesswoman, providing pic's only concession to 21st-century tastes -- pic is as neatly tailored, clean-cut, and visually appealing as a Savile Row suit. But auds accustomed to more knowing fare are likely to find its twists and turns outdated while yearning for a little of the rebellious fun that made the genre gleam in the first place.
Commercial prospects seem solid if not spectacular in Europe, with Stateside activity (Magnolia Pictures release goes out Nov. 30 in the U.S.) for this ultra-Brit product depending on whether the admittedly striking Caine-Moore combo raises the right expectations.
Opening credits sequence shows the journey of a diamond from mud to ring, suggesting the precision engineering of the plot to come, but also the moral murkiness involved in the ring's production.
The aging Laura Quinn (Moore, curiously made-up) is being interviewed about her role as a groundbreaking businesswoman. Pic then flashes back to 1960 London, when the power-suited, ambitious and brilliant Quinn, the only senior female exec at the London Diamonds Corp., becomes frustrated after being passed over for promotion by her male colleagues.
There has been a scandal at a South African mine and a hundred miners have died, threatening the company's relationship with the all-important Russians. Quinn hands the right political solution to company boss Sir Milton Ashtoncroft (Joss Ackland), but is then informed by the company's soon-to-retire janitor, Hobbs (Caine) -- who appears to know all the company business -- that she is about to be fired anyway.
Incredibly to Quinn, Hobbs is planning a heist: Like a Cockney Iago, he plays persistently on her insecurities, and soon she's dreaming about walking out of the building with diamonds stuck to the insides of her fingernails. Quinn obtains the code to the safe, while Hobbs manages to dupe the newly installed security cameras. ("What will they think of next?" he muses, in one of the script's winks to our less innocent times.)
The lengthy, nerve-wracking central heist sequence is beautifully shot, shuttling between Hobbs' attempts to enter the vault, security footage, a hungry guard and Moore's nervous attempts to make a red-herring phone call.
Plot then focuses on the increasingly edgy relationship between Hobbs and Quinn as insurance investigator Finch (Lambert Wilson) opens an inquiry and a mild flirtation with the heroine. But pic never sparkles as brightly as before.
One of the things that make Caine's '60s heist movies memorable is their sense of fun, something conspicuously lacking here -- it's as though the laughter were accidentally left out of the recipe while the heist ingredients were being carefully measured out. Nor is there much room for romance -- though some is smuggled in, rather movingly, courtesy of Hobbs.
Likewise, the modern imperatives of political correctness don't work in pic's favor. The exploitation of the miners serves only as a potential wrench in the gears of the plot, while the conventional ending barely reps the triumph of a woman over the system promised at the outset.Moore is convincing enough as Quinn, who's only superficially tough, and best when she lowers her guard and allows her nervousness to show through. (Her wobbly Brit accent is explained by the fact that she's an American who studied at Oxford.)
Caine, shuffling around in blue overalls, uttering softly spoken eternal truths, plays himself to perfection, but the duo's relationship, despite the actors' hard work, never quite sheds its artificiality or earns our sympathy. Ackland, as the spluttering, rubicund Sir Milton, is enjoyably Falstaffian.
Period detail is lovingly rendered (it's a nice touch to have people smoking in the cinema), while the technology is wonderfully '60s. Dialogue is occasionally spot-on; one potential suitor to Quinn explains that, since he's married, any affair would have to be "unadventurous." (This, after all, is before the Swingin' '60s were really under way.)
Away from Stephen Warbeck's effective orchestral score, smoky jazz -- such as Dave Brubeck's epoch-defining "Take Five" -- gorgeously reminds us where we are.


The CV of director Michael Radford  is nothing if not a lesson in cultural diversity: Born in India to a British father and an Austrian mother, he has directed films in England, Italy (that Oscar-nominated trifle of tourist porn, Il Postino ), Africa, and the U.S., most of which would scarcely be missed were the world's celluloid stockpiles suddenly to disappear. Radford's latest—a jewel-heist caper set in London—is no exception. In an abortive comeback role, Demi Moore  stars as the sole female executive at the fictional London Diamond Corporation, who, upon learning she's about to get the boot, teams up with a crafty cockney night janitor (Michael Caine ) to empty the corporate vault of its £100 million inventory. Rife with the lipstick traces of Inside Man , The League of Gentlemen  (which it explicitly references), and countless other superior heist pictures, Flawless  is the sort of movie that tends to get called "enjoyably old-fashioned," except that there's nothing enjoyable about it. The pacing is torpid, the plotting slack, and the performances utterly joyless—chiefly Moore, who walks through every scene with her face stretched into an expressionless mask, her lips pressed into a permanent pout. All of which is preferable to the movie's nauseatingly PC save-the-world coda, so heavy-handed you expect Sally Struthers  to greet you with a donation cup as you exit the theater.
