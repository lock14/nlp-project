There were half a million people at Woodstock, and in Ang Lee's impressively staged, thinly written Taking Woodstock , you feel as if you're seeing a great many of them flow by. The film mostly stays away from the festival's electric center of gravity. A lot of it is set in a run-down motel in the Catskills town of White Lake, N.Y., where hippie drifters start to show up and clog the roads. Lee captures the fractious, joyful, monstrously evolving  mass it all was.
The festival could have made for a lively   Altmanesque canvas of the counterculture.   Instead, Lee sets his sights on Elliot Tiber   (Demetri Martin), a shy interior designer whose cranky Yiddishe  parents own the motel in   question. Elliot inadvertently gets Woodstock launched by leading a trivial Chamber of  Commerce vote, and it's fun to see him rub shoulders with Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy), who rents his acreage out to the festival, and with Michael Lang, the bare-chested-under-his-vest hippie capitalist who masterminds the event; Jonathan Groff plays Lang as a cagey idealist who uses his ''Oh, wow!'' enthusiasm to size up every situation. But mostly we're watching Elliot, who is gay and scared, learn to give in to his feelings and defy his parents. He's the ''straightest'' guy in the film (ironic!), but there's a reason that no one at Woodstock ever chanted the  slogan ''Let the nice Jewish boy be free!''


 Correction Appended  Don’t be misled by the title of Ang Lee’s “Taking Woodstock.” This likable, humane movie is not an attempt to recreate the epochal Woodstock Music and Art Fair captured in Michael Wadleigh’s documentary “Woodstock.” It is essentially a small, intimate film into which is fitted a peripheral view of the landmark event that took place on Aug. 15 through 18, 1969, on a dairy farm in Bethel, N.Y., and has since been exalted ad nauseam for its good vibes.  Most of the concert takes place out of sight of the camera. The movie’s primary focus is El Monaco, a shabby Catskills motel in White Lake, N.Y., not far from the site on which 32 acts, including Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young,  the Who and Jimi Hendrix, made rock music history.  The little bit of the concert that is shown is a glowing, golden circle glimpsed in the far distance amid a throbbing acid haze outside the van of a gentle hippie couple. The music heard during the trip scene, “The Red Telephone” by the Los Angeles band Love, emanates not from the stage but from speakers inside the van, where the couple initiates a shy young stranger into the mysteries of LSD.  Like Mr. Lee’s 1999 Civil War drama, “Ride With the Devil,” which was set on the war’s western fringe, “Taking Woodstock” operates on the principle that contemplation of historic events from the margins can be more revealing than from the hot center. Although it shows an immense traffic jam, fields littered with trash and hippies gleefully sliding through mud, “Taking Woodstock” pointedly shies away from spectacle, the better to focus on how the lives of individuals caught up by history are transformed.  Structurally, the film resembles the event it remembers. The screenplay by Mr. Lee’s longtime collaborator James Schamus (he also wrote the script for “Ride With the Devil”) is open-ended and episodic. No one predicted the scale of the horde, estimated at half a million, that would descend on Bethel with limited supplies of food and water in unsettled weather. Any number of disasters could have turned what was billed as “An Aquarian Exposition” promising “3 Days of Peace & Music” into a massive bummer.  The main character, Elliot Tiber (Demetri Martin), from whose memoir, “Taking Woodstock: A True Story of a Riot, a Concert, and a Life” (written with Tom Monte) the film was adapted, is a mild-mannered, semicloseted gay interior decorator who has been living in Greenwich Village. As played by Mr. Martin, he suggests an earnest, sad-sack cousin of Dustin Hoffman’s Benjamin Braddock in “The Graduate.” For all its believability, Mr. Martin’s performance lacks the star magnetism that emanated from Mr. Hoffman playing an even more reticent character.  Elliot has returned to the Catskills to help his parents, Jake (Henry Goodman) and Sonia (Imelda Staunton), Jews who immigrated from Russia, keep afloat their financially failing motel. As the head of Bethel’s Chamber of Commerce, Elliot offers the motel as a home base for the promoters of Woodstock Ventures after the company loses its permit for an arts festival in the nearby town of Wallkill.  He also smoothes the way for Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy), the dairy farm’s owner, and Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff), the festival’s prime mover, to make a deal. Mr. Groff’s Lang is presented as a suave hippie capitalist with a streak of grandiosity; he appears, knightlike, atop a horse near the end of the movie.  “Taking Woodstock” is a gentle, meandering celebration of personal liberation at a moment when rigid social barriers were becoming more permeable, at least among the young. Elliot and his parents lead the list of those experiencing pangs of enlightenment amid the hippie swarm.  In a relationship that is made much more emphatically in Mr. Tiber’s memoir, the movie explicitly connects Woodstock to the gay-liberation movement and the Stonewall riots, which took place two months earlier that summer. A friend of Elliot’s even brings to the motel a record by Judy Garland, who had died a few days before the Stonewall uprising; some have theorized that grief over her death was a precipitating factor in the riots.  During his LSD initiation by the hippie couple, Elliot is cuddled and caressed by both the girl and the boy. The trip sequence is one of the most benign to be shown in any movie peddling period psychedelia. Elliot also takes inspiration from Vilma (Liev Schreiber), a ferociously masculine, kindhearted, cross-dressing Marine who appears at the motel and provides its security.  In their own moment of enlightenment, Jake and the grim, penny-pinching Sonia surrender their inhibitions after ingesting some hash brownies and suffer a major case of the giggles. The healing also extends to Elliot’s high school friend Billy (Emile Hirsch), a paranoid Vietnam veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.  The film’s wittiest nostalgic current is the presence of the Earthlight Players (who really existed), a visiting avant-garde theater troupe whose members use any excuse to disrobe collectively. The movie’s laugh-out-loud moment is their unrecognizable staging of Chekhov’s “Three Sisters” as a nude “happening,” in which they confront the audience and denounce “indecent legions of decency, fascist pornographers and racist warmongers.”  For all its sincerity, “Taking Woodstock” lacks the passion of Mr. Lee’s finest films, “Brokeback Mountain,” “Lust, Caution,” “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon” and “The Ice Storm.” I would add, however, that given a subject that has become synonymous with overblown mythmaking, its modesty becomes it.  “Taking Woodstock” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, strong language and sexual situations.
If you remember Woodstock , you probably werent there, the expression goes. And if you were, can you please stop gassing on about it? Aquarian Nostalgia is the most oppressively sanctimonious and dull stripe of reminiscing. Sure, the three free days of peace and music at Max Yasgurs farm passed without violent incident, but almost the second Jimi Hendrix  put his guitar down after playing The Star-Spangled Banner, the marketplace for boomer sentimental-journeys sprang up. Though the fact that Michael Lang , one of the rock shows original four organizers, canceled Woodstocks 40th-anniversary concert because of a lack of corporate sponsorship suggests that 60s narcissism may finally be coming to an end, Ang Lee s facile Taking Woodstock  proves that the decade is still prone to the laziest, wide-eyed oversimplifications.
To its credit, Taking Woodstock based on Elliot Tibers 2007 memoir, Taking Woodstock: A True Story of a Riot, a Concert, and a Life , and written by Lees frequent collaborator James Schamus features no actors pantomiming Janis Joplin , Ravi Shankar , or Sha-Na-Na; in fact, little music from the concert itself is heard. On display instead are inane, occasionally borderline offensive portrayals of Jews, performance artists, trannies, Vietnam  vets, squares, and freaks.
Though his age is never mentioned in the film, the real-life Elliot (whose surname is Teichberg in Lees movie and is played by Demetri Martin ) was 34 during the summer of 69. According to his memoir, Tiber was present at another sacrosanct revolution two months earlier: Stonewall. Elliots gayness becomes Lees tenuous overarching theme, awkwardly shoehorned in; Elliot and a butch construction worker he later makes out with meet-cute over a Judy Garland  record. But Elliots Uranian tendencies must be kept hidden from his Jewish-émigré parents, Jake and Sonia (Henry Goodman  and Imelda Staunton , the latter of whom is seen passed out on a pile of cash, clutching tens and twenties), who run El Monaco, a decrepit motel in upstate Bethel. The good, closeted, budding-entrepreneur son leaves Manhattan to help them, and, after reading that neighboring Wallkill  says no to hosting a bunch of long hairs grooving out to some hard rock, sets the wheels in motion for Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff ) and associates to have the concert in his Catskills  hamlet.
Beyond Elliots marginally interesting homo conflicthes given a push to come out by Liev Schreiber s ridiculous drag queen, Vilma, who shows up to provide securityTaking Woodstock  does nothing more than recycle the same late-60s tropes seen countless times since the Carter administration. The rages and flashbacks of Emile Hirsch s fried Vietnam vet are the usual PTSD overacting. The Earthlight Players, a performance troupe that lives in the barn next to El Monaco (Some are Vassar  graduates, Elliot explains), are as dumb a depiction of avant-garde thespians as something that Jesse Helms  might have concocted. On his way to the concert, uptight Elliot takes acid and sees the truth; back at the motel, perpetually miserable Jake and Sonia unknowingly scarf down pot brownies and frolic in the rain; father and son form a deep post-high bond the next day. Eat, drink, man, woman. Making his way through the political booths at Woodstock, Elliot sees women burning their bras at the United Feminist Front bootha practice debunked years ago, thus making it all the more irresistible to Schamus and Lee, apparently.
Near the films end, theres an allusion to Altamont , the free Rolling Stones  concert in December 1969 that would become the anti-Woodstock, but no mention of an even bloodier event that had occurred just the week before 500,000 kids gathered to hear Richie Havens : the Tate-LaBianca murders. Taking Woodstock  is a film for those who like childrens stories about tumultuous timeseveryone else can pick up Joan Didion s The White Album.
