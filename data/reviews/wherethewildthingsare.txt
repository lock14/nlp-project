�Be still!� shouts 10-year-old Max to the half-dozen Wild Things circling him with a hunger for small child � la mode. �Be still!� he shouts, and it works, both to stop the Wild Things in their tracks and as an occasional directive for the film itself, which doesn�t shy from long stretches of stillness, of quiet. That�s just one of the many moods so easily evinced by this freewheeling but tonally and aesthetically true adaptation of Maurice Sendak�s 1963 children�s book. Jonze, in collaboration with co-screenwriter Dave Eggers, seems to have tapped every primal feeling along the spectrum � joy, grief, rage, a relish for mayhem � and put it onscreen for our viewing pleasure. And a pleasure it is � the rare children�s film that isn�t coded for adults or made corny and flip for kids. Some reviewers will want to put quotes around the word when talking about Where the Wild Things Are
�s target audience ��you know, a �children�s�
 film � in part because the film contains some especially nuanced ideas and images, but mostly because Jonze has a history of making hip, somewhat sardonic films (Adaptation
, Being John Malkovich
). It�s a bit bewildering, at least in theory, to take him at his word here, but Where the Wild Things Are
 is a sincere, open-hearted film, and you�re best off greeting it in the same fashion. Eggers and Jonze expand upon the original story, which ran a mere 41 lines, to give its boy hero Max (Records) a single mom (Keener) and a grade-school science teacher (Mouzakis) who casually announces to a pop-eyed Max that the sun is dying, apparently ignorant of the way little kids fixate on � and can be terrorized by � the limitless but always incomplete information dumped on them. It�s a confusing time for Max, and he�s at that age that marks the waning days of absolute ownership of his mother�s body and mind. Mom is distracted � the way Max burrows under her desk and pulls at the pantyhose on her foot says in one small gesture everything you need to know about the complicated issues of intimacy and tugs for attention, for dominance, that Max is wrestling with, whether he knows it or not. So Max acts out � even worse, in front of Mom�s new boyfriend (Ruffalo) � and after a fearsome fight with his mother, he takes off running � and keeps running, until his neighborhood melts away and a way to a new world is found. That's where he meets the Wild Things, and they are marvelous. Working with Jim Henson�s Creature Shop and adapting quite literally Sendak�s original etchings, Jonze has put to film what generations of children have only dreamed about: the nearness and dearness
 of Sendak�s woolly beasts. Max gravitates to a similarly wayward spirit named Carol (voiced by Gandolfini), a furred giant with anger issues and a nose that looks rawed by whiskey. Not that there�s any whiskey in this land, which seems set perpetually at sunrise or sunset: Only the stuff of a little boy�s imagination exists here, things such as forts and dirt clod fights and cuddling. It�s a place where aggression and affection can live peaceably; one of the many delights of the film is in how physical
 it is (somebody is always pummeling somebody else and then following the beating with a bruising bear hug). There are a dozen more delights to be easily rattled off, from Karen O. and Carter Burwell�s score and the superb voicework to Records� fearless performance and Jonze and Eggers' deceptively rich script, which lifts bits and pieces from its prologue and reintroduces them later in an astute illustration of how a child plucks truths from his life and weaves them into his fiction. There are minor grievances with the film, all technical � Max�s flight from home is underlit to the point of near-obscurity, and the hand-held camera is jittery to distraction � but they frankly feel inconsequential when put next to the film�s overall effect. I don't want to oversell the thing. It is, quite simply, something very special indeed.

Let’s dispense with the preliminaries: What do the experts think of “Where the Wild Things Are’’? As the end credits rolled, my 12-year-old daughter and her bestest friend turned to me with faces like the twin masks of comedy and tragedy on a Broadway playbill. One girl’s eyes were wet with tears of sadness and profound joy; “I loved it,’’ she sighed. The other looked as if someone had stuck an egg-beater in her ear and scrambled her brains. “That is not a children’s movie,’’ she growled.

They’re both right. In adapting Maurice Sendak’s slender 1963 picture-book classic, director Spike Jonze and writer Dave Eggers have teased out the melancholy along with the magic. While this much-awaited, long-in-the-works film has more than its share of wild rumpuses, its big, shaggy heart is in what happens after the rumpus dies down: insecurities, misunderstandings, fears. “Where the Wild Things Are’’ isn’t for little kids so much as it’s about them, and parents and tykes expecting the next “Shrek’’ or even a seamless work of Pixar
 genius will be sorely disappointed if not a little freaked out. The movie is
 a wild thing, and that’s not such a bad thing at all.

In young Max Records  -  9 when the film was shot three years ago  - “Wild Things’’ has a Max who’s much older than in the book but who still has the proper mix of angel face and Tasmanian devil (besides, he looks great in wolf jammies). We’re introduced to him as he and the camera both appear to be tumbling downstairs at top speed; the title is scratched on the emulsion in an ADD blurt. So far, so good.

Eggers, a novelist and occasional voice of his generation, has reset Sendak’s tale in recognizable reality, but he thankfully doesn’t dwell on it. What we learn of Max’s life is overheard in snatches, the way a child listens: Dad is out of the picture, mom (Catherine Keener) is stressed from work, older sis (Pepita Emmerichs) has jerky friends, Max is alone
. A brief shot of mom smooching her new boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo) is all the boy and the movie need to flip out.

He dashes into the woods and “Wild Things’’ gracefully transitions from our world into Theirs. Max journeys by boat as in the book (no sea monsters, sadly) and there’s a frightening, tumultuous nighttime beach landing. The film at this point feels genuinely dangerous, wired to explode. The score by Karen O of the rock group Yeah Yeah Yeahs is acoustic but off-kilter: It sounds like the “Juno’’ soundtrack with teeth. Then we meet the first Wild Thing. His name is Carol, he’s having a tantrum, and he talks in the voice of Tony Soprano. Perfect
.
No, really, it works. James Gandolfini turns out to have exactly the rough-tough-creampuff vocal inflections a child’s best beast needs. When Carol sulks (which is a lot), it carries weight and it breaks your heart because that voice is so evenly split between menace and the cuddles. Gandolfini gives a great, awards-worthy performance and you never even see the man.

The Wild Things themselves have been designed by Jim Henson’s Creature Shop with extensive digital facework to give them full expressiveness. They’re remarkable creations, but you have to buy into the concept; if not  - if you’re feeling churlish or tired or unimaginative  - they’ll just seem like Muppets on steroids. There’s a giant rooster Thing named Douglas with Chris Cooper’s laconic voice; a lumbering couple, kindly Ira (Forest Whitaker) and sharp-tongued Judith (Catherine O’Hara); Alex the insecure goatboy (Paul Dano); and K.W. (Lauren Ambrose), who has the unkempt hair and “whatever’’ attitude of a slacker tween.

Max befriends them all and becomes their king  - he talks them down from eating him with the timeless command “BE STILL.’’ It turns out they need a king or, better still, a parent. “Where the Wild Things Are’’ reimagines monsters as big, top-heavy children; it’s one long unsupervised play-date, fascinating to watch but a little wearing for all concerned. Jonze over-relies on handheld camerawork to convey the group’s manic bursts of energy  - building a huge bowerbird-nest of a fort (a wonderful visual) or engaging in a dirt-clod war  - and the film too often gets the wobblies.

There are inert patches, too. As with any sugar high, the crash is bound to come, and entropy sets in sooner than we or Max would like. The filmmakers’ additions to Sendak  - like a pair of captured owls who speak in squawk-talk that only some of the characters understand  - are more eerie than enchanting, and Carol starts losing his temper for real. Here at last is the problem with adapting picture-book classics: Everything implicit in the drawings is forced to become explicit onscreen.

The original “Where the Wild Things Are’’ is a parable about self-control for very young children  - about the joys and dangers of letting fantasy run free, and about learning for oneself when to rein it in. Jonze’s film (to which Sendak has given his blessing) visualizes the process
 of learning control, and its keynote is anxiety  - the characters see and are saddened by the gap between what’s broken and how little we can do to fix it. Told the owls will answer only seven-word questions, Max asks “How do I make everyone O-K?’’ and the answer is an undecipherable squawk that means: Figure it out for yourself, kid.

Because Max is a boy and not a Wild Thing, we have faith he will. The moral is tucked away where you can’t see it, but it’s there. By this point you may have realized that this version of “Where the Wilds Things Are’’ isn’t about childhood at all but about childhood’s end and what’s gained and lost by it. That’s why very young kids, dull Disney princesses, overprotective parents, and self-serious grown-ups should probably stay away, while the college students after the screening I was at gathered outside and talked in low, exultant voices. That’s why the 12-year-old next to me wept: For everything from which she had so recently sailed away.



Profoundly beautiful and affecting, Where the Wild Things Are  is a breath- taking act of artistic transubstantiation. From Maurice Sendak's beloved picture book about a rambunctious little boy named Max and the kingdom of untamed creatures who adopt him as their like-minded king, filmmaker Spike Jonze has made a movie that is true to Sendak's unique sensibilities and simultaneously true to Jonze's own colorful instincts for anarchy. This is, to quote the 1963 children's classic, ''the most wild thing of all.'' It's also personal movie- making, with corporate backing, at its best. Whatever the (well-documented) struggles it took to create this gem, the result is worth every monster growl.
''Let the wild rumpus start!'' Max declares in Sendak's pages, and Jonze, working from   a just-right screenplay he co-wrote with   simpatico spirit Dave Eggers, begins the boy-centric hullabaloo from the very first frame. Max Records, a Botticelli-faced discovery, plays the fictional Max with a lovely purity of energy and freedom  he has a rare kid-aged talent for concentration in the midst of brouhaha. When we first meet him careening around the home he shares with his patient mom (huggable Catherine Keener), Max is a boy on a tear, all motor and no brakes. Whether roughhousing with his dog, devising snowball-warfare strategies, shrieking with a power surge of   energy, or collapsing in a child's heap of spent emotion, Max is a dervish of mixed instincts. And Jonze's astute longtime cinematographer, Lance Acord, captures the jumble naturally, chasing after the kid with the nimbleness of a monkey-cam.
It's when Max pushes Mom's tolerance to the limit  Mark Ruffalo has a sweet, small bit as a visiting boyfriend who wears the glazed smile of   ''Do I really need this crap?''  that the hero's adventure really begins. In Sendak's spare book (fewer than 350 words in all!), Max, outfitted in a really cool wildcat costume with whiskers, travels to unknown territory without leaving his room. In Jonze's seamlessly expanded view, he runs outside, whiskers erect, then boards a boat and heads to sea, and on and on ''in and out of weeks and almost over a year'' (to quote the book) to the place where the Wild Things are. The dark colors of nightmares break into golden hues. The music, by Karen O and Carter Burwell, haunts.
Such a place  so playful and mysterious! So liberating and scary! (Yes, some littler kids might be frightened during this PG-rated film, but probably no more so than they already are in their dreams, the kind that come with no rating system to guide a parent; besides, to face one's demons is to tame them, right?) Jonze and Eggers make a smooth storytelling leap by giving each Wild Thing a name and a personality, joyously inspired by Sendak's own illustrations of the creatures' bodies, balloon-big heads, and little V-shaped shark teeth. (Jonze regular Casey Storm designed the ebullient costumes.) I'll leave the discussion of personality integration to shrinks and online discussion groups. Any kid  or adult, for that matter  can identify with the anxieties of Carol (James Gandolfini, more delightfully vulnerable than we've ever heard him); the peace brokering of Judith (Catherine O'Hara, funny to her marrow); and the squabbles, preferences, vanities, and insecurities of Ira (Forest Whitaker), Alexander (Paul Dano), and Douglas (Chris Cooper). I especially like the measured feminine wisdom of KW (Lauren Ambrose). In their gorgeous landscape of dunes, jungle, and enigmatic structures that are as graceful as Noguchi sculptures (the production designer is K.K. Barrett), Max's new friends show him the way home to a self he can live with. On the way, I found myself bowled over with emotion.
Sendak's great gift to readers, old as well as young, is the seriousness with which he presents even the wildest mayhem, the deepest contradictions in human (and Wild Thing) behavior; the author empathizes with fantasists but has no time for cuteness. In his transcendent movie adaptation of Where the Wild Things Are , Spike Jonze not only respects the original text but also honors movie lovers with the same clarity of vision. This is one of the year's best. To paraphrase the Wild Thing named KW, I could eat it up, I love it so.


 Most of the snuffling, growling beasts that roam and often stomp through “Where the Wild Things Are,” Spike Jonze’s alternately perfect and imperfect if always beautiful adaptation of the Maurice Sendak children’s book, come covered in fur. Some have horns; most have twitchy tails and vicious-looking teeth. The beasts snarl and howl and sometimes sniffle. One has a runny nose. Yet another has pale, smooth skin and the kind of large, wondering eyes that usually grow smaller and less curious with age. This beast is Max, the boy in the wolf costume who one night slips into the kind of dream the movies were made for.  Max, played by the newcomer Max Records, is the pivotal character in this intensely original and haunting movie, though by far the most important figure here proves to be Mr. Jonze. After years in the news, the project and its improbability — a live-action movie  based on a slender, illustrated children’s book that runs fewer than 40 pages, some without any words at all — are no longer a surprise. Even so, it startles and charms and delights largely because Mr. Jonze’s filmmaking exceeds anything he’s done in either of his inventive previous features, “Being John Malkovich” (1999) and “Adaptation” (2002). With “Where the Wild Things Are” he has made a work of art that stands up to its source and, in some instances, surpasses it.  First published in 1963, the book follows the adventures of Max, who looks to be about 6 (he’s closer to 9  in the movie) and enters making mischief “of one kind and another” while dressed in a wolf suit with a long,  bushy tail and a hood with ears and whiskers. After his unseen mother calls him “wild thing!” and he threatens to eat her up, he is sent to his room without dinner. But his room magically transforms into a forest and, finding a boat, he sails to a place populated by giant, hairy, scary beasts that make him their king. Eventually the tug of home pulls him back to his room, where supper (“still hot”) sits waiting.  There are different ways to read the wild things, through a Freudian or colonialist prism, and probably as many ways to ruin this delicate story of a solitary child liberated by his imagination. Happily, Mr. Jonze, who wrote the screenplay with Dave Eggers, has not attempted to enlarge or improve the story by interpreting it. Rather, he has expanded it, very gently. The movie is still a story about a boy, his mother, his room, his loneliness and various wild things of his creation. But now there are new details and shadings to complement the book’s material, like Max’s older sister, Claire (Pepita Emmerichs), whose lank hair and adolescent gloom are touchingly mirrored by a wild thing named K W (voiced by Lauren Ambrose).  Like Mr. Sendak’s unruly boy, the movie’s Max is a storm without warning, throwing himself into the story while noisily chasing the family dog down some stairs. Shot with a handheld camera that can barely contain the boy’s image inside the frame, these clattering, jangling introductory moments are disruptive, disorienting — it’s hard to see exactly where Max and the dog are as you all tumble down — and purely exhilarating. Yet after jolting the story to excited life, Mr. Jonze quiets the movie down for a series of flawlessly calibrated scenes of Max alone and with his sister and mother (Catherine Keener), an interlude that tells you everything you need to know about the boy and that announces all that will happen next.  These scenes, lasting 20 minutes or so, are achingly intimate and tender. Mr. Jonze, working with his regular cinematographer, Lance Acord,  brings you close into Max’s world as he builds an igloo in the street, starts a snowball fight with Claire’s friends and is left to weep alone after the igloo is destroyed. (When Max slides into the igloo, the camera is right there, which means that you’re there too when disaster strikes.) The world is cruel, children too, lessons that Max absorbs through a smear of tears and hurt. The wound doesn’t heal. Max clomps and then stomps and then erupts: he roars at his mother. She roars back. And, then, like his storybook counterpart — like everyone else — he sails into the world, adrift and alone.  This is the existential given at the heart of both Mr. Sendak’s book and Mr. Jonze’s movie, which might come as a surprise to anyone who misremembers the original, with its dark, crosshatched lines; spiky emotions; Max’s many frowns; and the “terrible teeth” and “terrible claws” of the creatures. Though their conceptual bite remains sharply intact, Mr. Jonze’s wild things are softer, cuddlier-looking than the drawn ones because they have partly been brought to waddling life by performers  in outsize costumes. (The fluid tremors of emotion enlivening the fuzzy faces were primarily created through computer-generated animation.) The vexed, whining, caressing voices — James Gandolfini as Carol, Catherine O’Hara as Judith, Forest Whitaker as Ira, Paul Dano as Alexander and Chris Cooper as Douglas — do the expressive rest.  Max discovers the wild things on an island,  destroying their homes in fury and for kicks. Introductions are made, wary sniffs exchanged. But these are his kind of beasts, after all, and so, amid the rough splendor of a primeval forest where the air swirls with pink petals and snowflakes, he becomes their king. “Let the wild rumpus start!” he yells, as all the creatures, Max now included, rampage. It’s all very new (and scary) but also vaguely familiar, because we’ve seen it before. The tantrums, tears and angry words from the film’s first 20 minutes all start to resurface during this idyll, much as our waking hours invade our dreams: the snowball fight is recast as a dirt-clod battle. Max plays the angry child and then the reproving parent.  Much is left unexplained in Mr. Jonze’s adaptation, including Max’s melancholia, which hangs over him, his family and his wild things like a gathering storm. But childhood has its secrets, mysteries, small and large terrors. When a hilariously bungling teacher explains, rather too casually, that the sun is going to die, the flash of  horror on Max’s face indicates that he understands that the sun won’t be the only one to go. There are other reasons, perhaps, an absent father, a distracted mother. (And when a frightened Max listens to an argument between Carol and K W, you hear the echoes of parental discord.) But such analysis is for therapy, not art, and one of the film’s pleasures is its refusal of banal explanation.  On occasion, Mr. Jonze lingers too long on his lovely pictures, particularly on the island, where the film’s energy starts to wane, despite the glorious whoops in Carter Burwell and Karen O’s score. Mr. Jonze loves Max’s wild things, but  you don’t need to hang around  long to adore them as well. Yet  these are minor complaints about a film that often dazzles during its quietest moments, as when Max sets sail, and you intuit his pluck and will from the close-ups of him staring into the unknown. He looms large here, as we do inside our heads. But when the view abruptly shifts to an overhead shot, you see that the boat is simply a speck amid an overwhelming vastness. This is the human condition, in two eloquent images.    “Where the Wild Things Are” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). The wild things in the movie have been designed and directed toward a distinctly older age group than the book’s original audience.

Fleet of foot, emotionally attuned to its subject and instinctively faithful to its celebrated source, "Where the Wild Things Are" earns a lot of points for its hand-crafted look and unhomogenized, dare-one-say organic rendering of unrestrained youthful imagination. But director Spike Jonze's sharp instincts and vibrant visual style can't quite compensate for the lack of narrative eventfulness that increasingly bogs down this bright-minded picture. Widespread curiosity about the cinematic fate of Maurice Sendak's childhood perennial looks to spur sizable if not stellar commercial results in all markets, including on Imax screens.
Thematically, comparisons to everything from "The Wizard of Oz" to "Coraline" are not out of order for this flight of fancy on the part of an emotionally neglected 9-year-old boy; the driving impulse to escape an oppressive real life through creative fantasy is the same in all these books-to-films, as is their success in speaking simultaneously to children and adults. At the same time, contrasting "Wild Things" to two such superlative works in the same vein sharply shows up the new film's lack of density and complexity.
Granted, Jonze had a lot less to work with going in, as Sendak's 1963 volume, consisting of just 18 picture panels and 338 words of text, can be digested in less than five minutes. It's a simple but powerfully evocative tale of a mischievous boy who, sent to bed without supper, finds his room transformed into a dense forest and, after a long sea voyage, lands on an island populated by several fearsome-looking beasts, whom he tricks into believing he's "the most wild thing of all."
The most bracing section of the film is the first 15 minutes. Using a spot-on handheld camera and deft edits ruthlessly timed to when you need an air intake, Jonze pins the action on the aggressive energy of Max (Max Records) as he terrorizes his dog, bombards neighbor kids with snowballs and disrupts cozy time his mother (Catherine Keener) tries to have with a boyfriend (Mark Ruffalo, barely present). A great-looking kid, Records behaves with credible abandon and, without any child-actor mannerisms, provides the film with a solid center throughout.
Perhaps the greatest liberty Jonze and screenwriting cohort Dave Eggers take with Sendak's little yarn is their dispensing with the flowering of Max's bedroom, instead having him run off into some woods in his white wolf costume and find a sailboat that takes him through turbulent seas to a distant shore.
Upon arrival, Max finds six large and potentially dangerous creatures variously outfitted with scary horns, sharp claws, pointy teeth and large stomachs that need filling. Taking advantage of the beasts' general forlornness and evident need of an authority figure, Max introduces himself and is quickly accepted as their king. As in the book, Max's immediate command is, "Let the wild rumpus start!," whereupon one and all engage in mad behavior worthy of kids of all ages. By the time everyone calms down, however, it dawns that these big wild things are just like people -- in fact, rather too much so.
Free to have the wild things speak however they wanted, Jonze and Eggers surprisingly give them the voices and attitudes of middle-aged urban kibitzers; vaguely complainy and neurotic, the creatures are dominated by their sense of isolation and sadness. On the face of it, this is a choice with some wit behind it. But it also defangs the beasts from the outset -- one never fears that any of them would dream of making a meal out of Max -- and in the long run makes them far too ordinary.
Absent any sense of jeopardy or dramatic complications, the 70-odd minutes of screen time Max spends on the island (beautifully represented by rugged locations on the southern Australian coast near Melbourne) becomes a blur of rambunctious shenanigans, fort building, pretend warfare and confided feelings, particularly on the part of the imposing Carol (James Gandolfini), the most developed wild thing and the one to whom Max becomes closest.
There are fine creative inventions along the way, notably the large birds' nest-style structures the island inhabitants build and two funny squawking owls that aren't in the book. But nothing much is ever at stake, causing a story that begins in dynamic fashion to slowly devolve to the level of fleeting whimsy.
Most of the attention the film received during its prolonged production centered on the difficulty of seamlessly combining the large creature costumes with CGI facial expressions. The wild things move around pretty well and interact with Max in a credible way that fully justifies the no doubt difficult decision not to use CGI all the way. All the more ironic, then, that the film's biggest problem is not the look of the creatures but the manner in which they speak.
That said, the thesps provide low-key, nuanced readings, with Gandolfini and Lauren Ambrose particularly distinguishing themselves with dialogue that often seems odd coming from the toothsome mouths seen onscreen.
Excellent production values stress the relative realness of what's on view compared to the digital worlds of most kidpics these days. The alt-rock tenor of the music scoring is refreshing at first, but the predictability of the music cues proves increasingly wearisome.

Directed by Spike Jonze  from a 400-word children's picture book first published in 1963, Where the Wild Things Are  may be the toughest adaptation since Tim Burton  fashioned Mars Attacks!  from a series of bubble-gum cards. Tougher, actually: Burton was working with ephemeral, anonymous trash; Jonze is elaborating on a classic by distinguished author-illustrator Maurice Sendak .
As its title suggests, Where the Wild Things Are  is a book about the Freudian id—and it's also a media saga, having served as the basis for an animated short, an opera, a ballet, and a museum exhibit, as well as a prop for child psychologists and some relatively discreet merchandizing. Thus tucked into a collective, multigenerational unconscious, the slender text exudes authority. Jonze has struggled to bring the book—which was to have been his first feature—to the screen for even longer than the eight years it took Sendak to finish it.
The result isn't labored, so much as well-behaved. It's difficult not to watch the movie as a series of decisions carefully made and problems responsibly addressed by Jonze and screenwriter Dave Eggers : Will the unruly protagonist Max remain a pre-literate five or be older? (Older.) Is the projection of his inner world best achieved through animation or puppetry? (Puppetry.) Natural or fantastic landscapes? (Both.) What sort of music will comment on the action? (Insipid indie rock.) But, mainly, if one is to make something more than a 10-minute short, how to open up the book?
Wild Things  does open promisingly, with Max-ish doodles defacing the Warner Bros.  logo, and proceeds brilliantly in providing a bit of a backstory. Max (Max Record) is an apparently lonely nine-year-old living in a wintry old suburban neighborhood with an early adolescent elder sister and a harried, single mom (Catherine Keener ). Abandoned by his sis when her friends goodnaturedly wreck his front-yard igloo in a snowball fight, mad Max retaliates by trashing her room.
Unmotivated in the book, Max's tantrum here is triggered by his sister's betrayal and amplified by his mother's. (Women!) When mom brings a date (Mark Ruffalo ) home for dinner, Max dons his wolf suit and chomps down on her shoulder. "What is wrong with you? You're out of control!" she shrieks as the bad boy flees the house. The music grows wilder—it's Max's night to howl. He finds a boat and sails off to discover his fellow Wild Things. So far, so totally Cassavetes: The first 15 minutes have a liberating, handheld tumult only slightly mitigated by alt goddess Karen O 's wistful, borderline twee, vocalizing.
Arriving at the heart of darkness, Max finds the Wild Things staging their own destructive freak-out in the woods. Nine-foot puppets with digitally enhanced expressions and celebrity voices (Catherine O'Hara 's being by far the most expressive), the WTs are hyper-real reproductions of Sendak's cuddly-scary creatures—if considerably more loquacious. Master Record acquits himself well playing opposite these things, particularly once he becomes their king and proclaims that the mad, dancing, shouting, havoc-wreaking Wild Rumpus must begin. It is this taboo-breaking expression of infantile rage and the fantasy of omnipotence, given a spread of six wordless pages in a 37-page book, that Professor John Cech  described in his tome on Sendak's poetics as "a complete, pre-Oedipal submersion in the child's ecstatic eroticism in which he satisfies his libido's wish to dance with the overpowering beasts of his own creation."
The book ends soon after; the movie goes for perhaps another hour. Falling asleep in the midst of a creaturely cuddle-puddle, Max awakes not in his room, as more or less happens in the book, but to the realization that he, the King of the Wild Things, must rule. (Call it his Obama  moment.) "Will you keep out all the sadness?" one subject wonders. Turns out that the Jonze-Eggers WTs are rife with complicated relationships, hurt feelings, lost best friends, and secret new ones. (The identity of the latter makes for the movie's funniest joke.) In an attempt to maintain his position, King Max produces one rumpus too many—and the neediest member of the gang (James Gandolfini ) rips off the big bird thing's arm (a horrifying moment, actually). Yelling that the perp is "out of control," Max has learned what it's like to be a parent: Time to go home.
While hardly as hysterical as Dorothy's return from Oz, the denouement does lack Sendak's unsentimental restraint—and, consequently, its power. Sendak was working from his own unconscious with Where the Wild Things Are , a book he has called "a personal exorcism." The artist has cited early Mickey Mouse  cartoons and King Kong  as formative experiences, with a Jewish subtext that would give the Coen Brothers  conniptions. Sendak's yidishe mame  used to scold him as a vilde chaya  (wild beast) when he got too noisy, while her family directly inspired the Wild Things: "They came almost every Sunday. My mother always cooked for them, and, as I saw it, they were eating up all our food. . . . They'd lean way over with their bad teeth and hairy noses, and say something threatening like, 'You're so cute I could eat you up.' " The opera Wild Things  assigns the creatures his relatives' names. Shocking, as Sendak's near-contemporary Philip Roth  observed in the aftermath of Portnoy's Complaint : "Going wild in public is the last thing in the world that a Jew is expected to do."
