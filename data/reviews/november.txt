         "November" is not the sleek lady-in-distress thriller that its trailers suggest. More of a psychological mystery, it gets underway with a well-staged opening sequence as a young man (James Le Gros) stops at a corner market in Los Angeles one evening to buy chocolate ice cream for his girlfriend, Sophie (Courteney Cox), only to walk straight into a holdup and wind up shot dead. Writer Benjamin Brand and director-editor Greg Harrison divide their highly stylized and atmospheric 78-minute film into three sections, each dated Nov. 7, the date of that fateful evening, and titled, respectively, "Denial, "Despair" and "Acceptance," which may or may not offer a clue as to what's really going on in this increasingly perplexing film, which is more concerned with being clever than satisfying.
 
  When "Despair" appears, the holdup plays out in a distinctly different manner, and "Acceptance" carries those events further, leading to a climactic moment that leaves a key element dangling. "November" can be seen as a tragedy that is a jumbled flashback, as a tormented fantasy on the part of Sophie in the throes of a mental breakdown — or both. Or perhaps there's still another layer of meaning, seemingly involving Sophie's spurned lover, Jesse (Michael Ealy), and therefore a stunning coincidence, but it's hard to say.
 


         






    Cox capably manages her character's constantly changing emotions, as does Le Gros as Hugh. Although too young for the part, Anne Archer, as Sophie's sophisticated mother, offers a warm, relaxed contrast to the harried Sophie. There's also good support from Nora Dunn, Nick Offerman and others. Locations are almost entirely in recycled buildings in downtown L.A., and cinematographer Nancy Schreiber, costume designer Danny Glicker and production designer Tracey Gallacher have conspired assiduously to create a look of drab, brownish retro chic. Lew Baldwin's score is suitably unsettling. There's enough talent and imagination on display in Harrison's second feature — the first was "Groove" — to suggest he and his team could come up with a more accessible film next time around.

In November , Courteney Cox plays Sophie, a photographer whose boyfriend (James Le Gros) is murdered during a convenience-store robbery. And in keeping with the arty look of the indie drama (shown at Sundance in 2004), director Greg Harrison's somber story of guilt, memory, and darkroom techniques can perhaps be described as an homage to the work of David Hockney: Just as Hockney assembles smaller, overlapped Polaroids that don't necessarily make sense into a big picture that does, so Harrison, working from a script by Benjamin Brand, reveals the full circumstances of a violent crime through a flickering series of scenes modified in repetition.
The depth of the story and the characters (including Anne Archer as Sophie's mother and Nora Dunn as her therapist) is awfully slight to bear the weight of such fancy editing. But the performances are crisp and in focus, with Cox in particular showing a photogenic feel for expressing grief.

To say that Elisabeth Kübler-Ross meets David Lynch in the twisty paranoid thriller "November" is not to suggest that this surreal cinematic puzzle is at all profound or that it even wants to be. The movie, directed and edited by Greg Harrison from a screenplay by Benjamin Brand, refers to Kübler-Ross's  stages of grief in chapter titles like "denial" and "acceptance." And its aggressively spooky surrealism, its evocation of multiple realities (it has three different endings) and its method of obsessively circling back in time recall Mr. Lynch's "Mulholland Drive." But these are just references in a cleverly assembled film, shot and edited on digital video for a pittance (reputedly $150,000). "November" wants only to be an entertainingly squirmy mind tease. As the movie follows Sophie Jacobs (Courteney Cox),  a college photography teacher recovering from the trauma of her boyfriend's murder, it offers no deep insights into the human condition. In the same way that a crossword puzzle tickles the mind without asking to be taken as literature, "November" plays games for the sake of game-playing. It also has a pretentious streak. One clue it flashes is the recurrent image of a newspaper whose front-page headline asks, "Is modernism dead?" The story returns repeatedly to Nov. 7. That was the day that Sophie and her boyfriend, Hugh (James Le Gros), went out for dinner and afterward stopped at a convenience store because Sophie, still hungry, wanted a snack. In the first of the film's several recapitulations of that evening, Sophie waits outside in the car and talks on her cellphone to a lover, Jesse, with whom she recently ended an affair. In the store, a robber barges through the door and demands Hugh's cash. When Hugh pleads that all he has is a credit card, he is shot to death, along with the owner. In later versions of the story, Sophie herself is an eyewitness hiding behind a shelf. There are more pieces to this puzzle and more cinematic references. Sophie gives a lecture to her students in which she declares that what is left out of a picture can be as important as what is shown within its frame. (Think "Blow Up.") In class, she sees (or imagines she sees) in her slide carousel a mysterious photo of her car parked in front of the convenience store. Is it real? And if so, who took the picture and how did it get there? She demands that Officer Roberts (Nick Offerman), the police officer  investigating the crime, track down its source. There are recurrent scenes of Sophie having lunch with her mother (Anne Archer) and of Sophie visiting a psychiatrist (Nora Dunn) in a building whose elevator doesn't work. But the spookiest moments observe Sophie at home alone. Ominous banging on the ceiling loosens the pictures on her walls. A peephole into the next apartment is revealed. She receives mysterious telephone calls from a distressed, faraway voice that through the static sounds like Hugh's. These images of a mind crumbling into madness recall Roman Polanski's creep show "Repulsion." Until the middle of the film, "November" withholds the emotional meat of the story. We belatedly learn that because of Sophie's affair, Hugh had moved out of their apartment, and that on Nov. 7, the couple were reuniting. In addition to being traumatized by Hugh's murder, Sophie is coping with three kinds of guilt: the guilt over her affair, guilt for feeling responsible for the murder by asking Hugh to stop at the store and the guilt of having survived him. Ms. Cox, radically deglamorized for "November," is a drab screen presence, a kind of Neve Campbell manqué. Mr. Le Gros's Hugh, a workaholic lawyer who is devastated by Sophie's betrayal, has more dimension. But "November" is not really about character. It is about states of mind and the post-traumatic stress that breaks down the line between the conscious and unconscious minds. As for the death of modernism, the question seems inserted as a red herring. "November" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and sexual situations.
Like a jigsaw that's more fun to assemble before you know how all the pieces fit, Greg Harrison 's brain-teasing meta-thriller November  is less compelling the more apparent its solution becomes. But before the foregone conclusion surfaces about halfway through, its disparate, unnerving components are mesmerizing. Presented semi- Rashomon -style as a trio of conflicting perspectives, November  examines the grief and confusion of photography teacher Sophie Jacobs  (Courteney Cox ) after her boyfriend, Hugh (James LeGros ), is killed during a convenience store robbery. The shooting and earlier occurrences are covered in three lugubriously intertitled acts, where the details vary and the outcome is subtly but dramatically different. Clues to the actual chain of events abound, but Sophie's fractured psyche can only assimilate them piecemeal. She gets some assistance from a shrink (Nora Dunn ), a cop (Nick Offerman ), and her nagging mom (Anne Archer ).
At best, November  evokes the metaphysical dread and topsy-turvy existentialism of films like Memento , Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , and inevitably, Mulholland Drive . Like them, it mimics the disorienting effects of trauma on memory and consciousness, while leaving the impression that something unearthly is at play. But November  runs out of surprises well before it climaxes, and by the third go-round the plot's thinness is all that's left to illuminate. Harrison's indifference to the acting doesn't help: Cox is left to convey Sophie's emotional tumult via an icy, flat demeanor that suggests impatience rather than depression, while LeGros is ever the benignly charming slacker (playing an attorney, no less), over whom it's hard to imagine anyone getting worked up. Harrisona trailer editor before turning to directing and November 's editor as wellpays more attention to the cutting, cinematography, and sound design, and the atmosphere he achieves through inexplicably creepy noises, skewed perspectives, and disquieting color shifts is where the film leaves its most lasting impression. Ultimately, however, the enormity of Sophie's loss is overshadowedand not underscoredby the cinematic trickery. At one point, as she lectures her class, Sophie says that artists often "assert something by excluding." If, like Harrison, they're not careful, they're just as likely to exclude something by asserting.
