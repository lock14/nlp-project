1974 was a good year for Burt Reynolds. Coming off the success of Deliverance
 two years earlier and the more recent popular appeal of White Lightning
 (which recast him with Ned Beatty), Reynolds had plenty of years before Loni, Dom, and Stroker Ace
 would manhandle his career into self-parody. One of two Reynolds teamings with director Robert Aldrich, The Longest Yard
 reworked Aldrich�s own The Dirty Dozen
 for the gridiron to spectacular, epithet-laden success. While this new remake is considerably toned down in terms of both the original�s freewheeling (and hilarious) vulgarities and grim prison violence, director Segal and star Sandler acquit themselves with, if not exactly honor, then at the very least a full understanding of what made the rough-and-tumble original film so appealing. Sandler takes over for Reynolds as former pro footballer Paul Crewe, disgraced in a point-shaving debacle and current resident of a Texas penitentiary after drunkenly stealing his girlfriend�s Bentley (not nearly as macho-resonant as the Maserati Reynolds nicked in Aldrich�s film) while on a late-night bender. Once incarcerated, Crewe is forced by sadistic, football-mad warden Hazen (Cromwell) to recruit the worst of the worst for an upcoming Guards versus Cons football match. With help from Caretaker (Rock) and former pro Nate Scarborough (Reynolds), Crewe and his band of muscled misfits manage to finesse a real team into existence via nonstop practice and the occasional inspirational speech. Director Segal clearly knows Sandler�s strengths (he should � they�ve teamed together before on Anger Management
 and 50 First Dates
) and consistently plays to them. That�s especially noticeable during the film�s opening scenes, during which Crewe cracks wise to his girlfriend (Cox), a pair of cops, and finally Warden Hazen and his alpha bull, Captain Knauer (the underused Fichtner). Once the ramp-up to game day begins, however, the film asks you to buy the scrawny, overtly menschy Sandler as a former NFL champ. That�s admittedly a bit of a stretch, but to his credit, the actor manages even that, and The Longest Yard
 rarely succumbs to the full-on pigskin comedics of, say, The Waterboy
. What makes this version of the film ingratiating is similar to what made Aldrich�s such a success in the first place: the script � this time credited to Sheldon Turner, working from Tracy Keenan Wynn�s original. Segal stays remarkably faithful to Wynn�s template, including whole scenes and even snatches of nonblue dialogue, which quickly defuses the sense that you�re watching not a remake but a rip-off. Added to that is an appropriately bulky supporting cast, including a clutch of familiar faces in the form of both guards (Brian Bosworth, Steve Austin, Kevin Nash) and prisoners (Bill Goldberg, Michael Irvin). Leachman replaces Bernadette Peters as the warden�s lascivious secretary, while rap import Nelly coasts through on his good looks and hip-hop charm. Over the years, Aldrich�s original has gained a certain cachet of prestige that it didn�t have upon its release; never a film classic in the true sense, it was instead a rowdy crowd-pleaser that merited a lengthy parody in the pages of Mad
 magazine. Segal�s version is no sports-film watershed, either, but it is consistently entertaining, athletically brutal, and, more often than not, well-acted. Which is more than can be said for The Replacements
 and other semirecent footballer films.

         "The Longest Yard" is a gritty underdog comedy about a disgraced former NFL star turned kept man who lands in jail after destroying his girlfriend's car; then redeems himself by leading his fellow convicts in a victorious football game against the prison guards.
 
  I'm talking, of course, about the 1974 original, starring Burt Reynolds — an actor whose mustache alone could take on any number of masochistic corrections officers. The movie that's out now is a remake of that film, and it stars Adam Sandler — an actor who doesn't even have a mustache.
 


         






    There's no point in going into a blow-by-blow comparative analysis of the two, mainly because "The Longest Yard" redux is aimed at people whose parents were just learning to drive in 1974. But just for the sake of marveling at how much times have changed since then, movie-wise, compare and contrast the following opening scenes: Paul Crewe (Reynolds) and his cheesecakey girlfriend are lying on the bed at crossed purposes. She's trying to seduce Paul, Paul's trying to get drunk and watch the game. Frustrated, the girlfriend starts berating him for being the lazy, drunken, expensive has-been he is, and Paul eventually reacts by slamming her against the wall, stealing her Maserati and pitching it into the bay.
 
  In the new movie, Paul is alone in the bedroom watching football drunk, when his girlfriend, an alarmingly thin and shrill Courteney Cox, bursts in and demands he put on a little sailor suit and come downstairs to entertain her guests. Why she wants him to wear a little sailor suit is never explained. Paul reacts by locking her in the closet, stealing her Bentley and wrecking it in a multi-patrol car pile-up.The point being: Burt Reynolds' Paul was supposed to be a jerk. A cool jerk, a tough jerk, even a sexy jerk, but a jerk nonetheless. It's only when he takes on even bigger jerks (masochists and racists who look like they've walked off the pages of a Nazi fetish magazine) that he gets to be a hero. Sandler's Paul, by contrast, is supposed to be a mensch, basically, a regular guy who has "made some mistakes," as the kids say nowadays, and is now reduced to being trotted out like a circus monkey for the amusement of his castrating power girlfriend's uppity friends.
 
  Sandler is a charismatic and extremely likable actor, and he does a decent impersonation of tough and sexy here, but the weird casting and tortured characterization knocks the whole film off-kilter. The remake follows more or less the same plot as the original, only with all the social subtext removed. The result is that the prison (this time set in Texas instead of Florida) feels like summer camp, only with cigarettes and smuggled Big Macs. And in return for buying Adam Sandler as a former NFL quarterback and Chris Rock as a guy who could survive a day in prison, we get jokes about testicles.
 
  Paul finds himself between a rock and nut case when Capt. Knauer (William Fichtner) lets him know that Warden Hazen (James Cromwell) is going to ask him to coach the guards' football team and that he's to politely decline without ratting out Knauer. The warden is fanatical about his team; he's hired his guards based on their ability to play and wants to ensure they'll win their first game of the season.
 
  Knauer doesn't want him anywhere near his team, because Crewe is universally loathed for point shaving. (He's the only player ever to be indicted on federal racketeering charges.) You can see his dilemma. Paul does as Knauer tells him, and Knauer beats him like a drum. Finally, the warden decides that Crewe will train a group of cons to play a "tune-up" game against the guards — ensuring the guards an easy victory and a boost in confidence before the start of the season.
 
  Paul's resourceful sidekick, Caretaker, is played by Chris Rock, who is always funny, but as an actor he comes off like a comedian trying to make sure the people in the back row can hear him. Caretaker helps Paul recruit the most violent, hard cases for the team; though, for violent types, the team members are surprisingly kittenish. Sure, there's the guy who wiles away the days banging his head against the wall (that would be Dalip Singh, a strapping, taciturn 7-footer who promises to be the Richard Kiel — the guy who played Jaws in "Moonraker" — of our day). I've never been to prison, but the mentally defective seem to be unusually well-represented here. At least a third of the cast appears to be operating at concussed squirrel capacity.
 
  Burt Reynolds reprises the role of Nate Scarborough, the old head coach, and rapper Nelly plays Meggett, the running back whose reluctance to join the team emanates mainly from a feeling of sports' contempt — a white-men-can't-jump sort of thing — that's quickly resolved with a violent game of one-on-one.
 
  With Paul cleaned up and the darkness of the original cleared away, "The Longest Yard" is left with little to work with besides puerile jokes (rendering the movie's central violent tragedy jarring and absurd) and displays of athletic ability. The cast includes several figures from the worlds of football, basketball and professional wrestling, plus Tracy Morgan as a cross-dressing cheerleader. The sports cinematography is impressive and probably the only tangible improvement on the first one. If you're thinking of seeing it, and you're old enough to drive (or even read this), do yourself a favor and rent the original instead.

 Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures present a Happy Madison/MTV Films production, in association with Callahan Films. Director Peter Segal. Screenplay by Sheldon Turner. Based on the screenplay by Tracy Keenan Wynn. Director of photography Dean Semler. Editor Jeff Gourson. Production designer Perry Andelin Blake. Running time: 1 hour and 49 minutes. In general release.   

Adam Sandler doesn't look like a guy who could shave points off a football game, at least not without bursting into tears of remorse and apologizing in a high-pitched burble. Burt Reynolds does  and did with even more anarchic macho swagger some 30 years ago when he originated the role of disgraced former NFL quarterback Paul ''Wrecking'' Crewe currently reprised by Sandler in The Longest Yard . And therein lies a cultural shift that culminates in the reasonably diverting but curiously defanged remake of the jailhouse-gridiron underdog saga we have now before us: In studio comedies and urban entertainments  even those that claim to rebel against the system, stick it to the power, and detonate the bombs of racial bigotry  we are living in the age of the PG-13 Sandler Man, intrinsically nice team player, rather than the R-rated Reynolds Man, potentially dangerous lone fox. And in such a setting of boys-at-play, it's harder to tell the subversive from the product-placement deal.
Not that this remake, directed by simpatico Team Sandler member Peter Segal (Anger Management ), doesn't generously follow the playbook of the original, either in story, dialogue, or, in many places, shot selection. (One difference: Tracy Keenan Wynn's original script made no disposable references, as Sheldon Turner's does, to Beyoncé, Star Jones, Michael Jackson, Forrest Gump, or Shrek.) Now as then, Crewe starts off as a drink-sloshed has-been, a washed-up former Sports Somebody who, when we first meet him, dumps his rich-bitch girlfriend, steals her fancy car, and leads cops on a wild high-speed chase. (In this case the bitch in the boob-spilling frock is played by an uncredited Courteney Cox Arquette, and Sandler looks as whipped by this scary specimen of the female sex as he did by Téa Leoni in Spanglish .)
Once captured, roughed up, and sent off to a prison far from home, Crewe first endures the taunting hatred of his fellow cons, ready to forgive rape, murder, and thievery, but not something as ''un-American'' as throwing a game. Then he endures the bullying of the prison's warden (James Cromwell), a rotten, football-obsessed politician eager to make use of his new star inmate as a coach, on the convict side, in a rigged football match between the guards and the cons.
As it was in Robert Aldrich's original, the heart of The Longest Yard  is the building of the team that calls itself the Mean Machine  a band of multihued brothers bound by shared status as incarcerated scum  and the playing of the cataclysmic game itself, in what sometimes feels like actual time. (The fundamental things applied too in the bone-cruncher 2002 British remake, Mean Machine , starring anvil-headed soccer star Vinnie Jones.) But then, even as the sports choreography intensifies and Segal cuts from crowd reactions to scoreboard close-ups to shots of the tranny-convict cheerleaders in full Rockette formation, this new, MTV-generation version downshifts into a different, broader, gentler, less politically subversive comedy than Aldrich's bleaker end run around Watergate-era authority. The real tyranny of the jailer over the jailed alluded to in 1974  certainly a topic of wincing interest in a modern era of Guantánamo and Abu Ghraib  is laughed off in favor of a few race jokes.
And oddly, the new version skews neutral despite the featured participation of the always usefully mouthy Chris Rock as the wily prison fixer known only as Caretaker (a role originated by Jim Hampton). Flitting around Texas' fictional Allenville Penitentiary with a cigarette tucked behind his ear and a finger in every inside deal, observing his too-soft-for-Oz fellows (including rap star Nelly and SNL 's Tracy Morgan among the prisoners, and ex-jocks Brian Bosworth and Bill Romanowski among the guards), Rock's Caretaker becomes a one-man chorus of easy barbs. Each joke and one-liner is a made-for-HBO zinger, each scene with Sandler a reaffirmation of the old friendship between the two successful SNL  alums, now celebrating their success with a big-ticket comedy in which getting smashed in the crotch is as good as a handshake.
It's a safe bet that the prime audience for the movie won't have seen the original, won't be able to recall Reynolds in his 1970s prime, and won't, indeed, care whether the yard is long, short, or covered in crabgrass, so long as it sprouts eye-catching celebrities like Sandler, Rock, and Nelly. Yet I can't help thinking that in this game of remake, points have been shaved.

n "The Longest Yard," the crummy remake of the 1974 film of the same title, Adam Sandler stars as the former N.F.L. quarterback Paul Crewe, who years earlier was booted out of the league for shaving points. In the original film, directed with seriocomic facility by the great Robert Aldrich, Crewe was played by Burt Reynolds with effortless charm, tufts of visible chest hair and the tightest pants this side of Tony Orlando. Finding a perfect groove as the fallen hero, Mr. Reynolds didn't attempt to ingratiate himself with the audience or make nice; he knew that we would fall for him anyway. Mr. Reynolds is also on hand for the remake, and here's hoping he  snagged a nice fat paycheck for his trouble and ours. This time, the actor plays the role of a former college ballplayer, Nate Scarborough, who has been kicking around a dusty Texas prison yard for decades and wants to lend Mr. Sandler's character a helping coaching hand. As in the earlier movie, Crewe has landed in jail after violating parole and resisting arrest, among other infractions. He has also attracted the attention of Warden Hazen (James Cromwell), a cookie-cutter martinet who thinks he can use Crewe to improve his semi-pro team made up of guards and headed by Captain Knauer (William Fichtner, stuck playing a baddie once again). The new movie was written by Sheldon Turner, whose contribution to Tracy Keenan Wynn's original screenplay consists of the usual updating, including a lame bit about the television show "The View." It's uncertain, however, whether Mr. Turner or the director Peter Segal deserves the blame for the opportunistic use of Malcolm X's image in one scene. This iconic image pops up in a scene that, like much of the movie, plays a lot like the original, albeit with some instructive differences. In the scene, a couple of white prison guards try to bait a black member of Crewe's team, here named Megget and nicely played by the rapper Nelly. Megget smartly refuses to take the bait. But because the filmmakers want to make sure we don't think he's a coward, they toss in Malcolm X. Leaving aside the idea that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. might have made  more sense in a scene hinged to passive resistance, this scene indicates just how little faith the filmmakers have in their audience and how much anxiety they have about what it means to be a man. Only with Malcolm X watching over him can Megget be forgiven for not talking back, for not getting his skull cracked, for not getting tossed off the team; only with Malcolm X serving as his symbolic guardian angel, it seems, can he be a real black man. One of the points that Aldrich makes in his movie is that the character is smart enough to bide his time. His courageous resistance inspires other black inmates to join forces with Crewe to fight what is, after all, a common enemy. Aldrich didn't haul out Malcolm X to pump up his football saga and curry favor with the audience, partly because the film's larger theme - the relentless pursuit of power - transcends racial lines. In the remake, Warden Hazen wants to use his football team as part of his strategy to assume the state governorship. The original  Hazen (played by Eddie Albert, doing a 180-degree turn from his affable role on the sitcom "Green Acres") simply covets power,  a rather more nihilistic take on what it means to live and to play ball. For Aldrich, football isn't just another Sunday night entertainment, it is emblematic of the human condition. The trappings of that entertainment - the cheerleaders, marching bands and cheering crowds - are secondary to the game's camaraderie, strategies and meaning. You play, therefore you are. The first "Longest Yard" doesn't represent Aldrich and 1970's American moviemaking at their finest, but it certainly moves better and skews smarter than the remake. Softer, louder and cleaner than the 1974 version, the new film sentimentalizes the prisoners and the game, filing down their sharpest edges so that winning becomes a matter of triumph rather than resistance. In this respect, it is worth noting that the new film contains more speaking parts for  black actors than the original. First  among these unequals is Chris Rock, who as Crewe's right-hand man, Caretaker, has assumed the humiliating job of playing second banana to a less-gifted comedic talent. But like the hip-hop-heavy soundtrack, these speaking roles are mere calculation, a crude ploy to lure in black audiences and to make white audiences feel cool by proxy. Unlike Mr. Reynolds, Mr. Sandler has never been cool. Mr. Sandler's talent, such as it is, has been his ability to embody a strain of everyday guyness characterized by an undercurrent of aggression and a thick overlay of smug. At his best (notably, the drag-down fight with Bob Barker in "Happy Gilmore"), Mr. Sandler brings the American primitive male to instantly recognizable, abrasive life. The director Paul Thomas Anderson tapped into that primitivism in his film "Punch-Drunk Love," but Mr. Sandler needs more off-center roles if he is going to transcend his rapidly aging frat-boy  persona. Both last year's "Spanglish," in which he played a family man, and "The Longest Yard" appear to be part of a strategy aimed at turning Mr. Sandler into an adult. But that can't happen with movies made by thumb-suckers for the delectation of other thumb-suckers. "The Longest Yard" is rated PG-13  (Parents strongly cautioned).  It features football violence, homophobic jokes and an intimation of gun violence.

It's way too early for comparisons to Jack Lemmon and Billy Wilder, or even to Jerry Lewis and Frank Tashlin, but Adam Sandler and helmer Peter Segal can boast yet another solidly commercial collaboration: "The Longest Yard," a shrewdly updated yet surprisingly faithful remake of Robert Aldrich's 1974 football-behind-bars dramedy starring Burt Reynolds. Sandler impressively assumes the Reynolds role here, with strong support by Reynolds himself and a slightly restrained but frequently hilarious Chris Rock. This mass-appeal crowd-pleaser is poised to score sturdy numbers during its opening weekend kick-off. Play-off should be leggy, and followed by huge post-season vid numbers.
The second reprise of an Aldrich pic to hit screens in recent months, following underrated and under-performing "Flight of the Phoenix," "Longest Yard" rarely strays far from the original playbook scripted by Tracy Keenan Wynn (from a story by producer Albert S. Ruddy, who returns as an exec producer for the remake).
Revised screenplay credited to Sheldon Turner -- and possibly enhanced by ad-libs from Sandler, Rock and others -- allows more room for broader comedy, whichlets Sandler and Segal (reunited after "Anger Management" and "50 First Dates") play to their strengths. But rough-and-tumble of climactic gridiron match-up between prisoners and guards is scarcely less violent here than in the R-rated original. Only the language appears to have been sanitized (Rock lobs only a single F-bomb) to obtain a PG-13 rating.
Disgraced former NFL quarterback Paul "Wrecking" Crewe (Sandler) rebels against his role as boy-toy for a rich bitch (played, fleetingly but shrewishly, by an unbilled Courteney Cox Arquette) by drunkenly joyriding in her expensive sports car. Violating terms of an earlier five-year probation for his role in a point-shaving scheme, Crewe winds up in a Texas federal penitentiary.
Warden Hazen (James Cromwell), a football fanatic with political ambitions, wants Crewe to help coach his semi-pro team of prison guards. But Captain Knauer (William Fichtner), the turf-conscious player-coach of the guards, makes it known he doesn't want Crewe's help.
Out among the prison population, Crewe gets an even frostier reception. Caretaker (Rock), a wheeler-dealer convict who befriends the otherwise friendless newcomer, explains: The convicts will forgive rape, murder, grand theft auto or writing bad checks, but shaving points in a football game crosses the line. It's "un-American," Caretaker says.
With a little help from grizzled sage Nate Scarborough (Reynolds), another NFL veteran doing hard time, Crewe recruits a team of inmates for a practice game against the guards. Joining up are Deacon Moss (former Dallas Cowboy Michael Irvin), Brucie (Nicholas Turturro) and Torres (Lobo Sebastian).
Rapper Nelly and pro wrestler Bill Goldberg also figure prominently on a team that defies the odds during the climactic, brutally funny half-hour grudge match. As in the original, for Crewe, the game is a shot at redemption. For his players, it's a chance to take a shot at the guards.
In its time, the original "Yard" was viewed by many as an ersatz companion piece to Aldrich's 1967 "The Dirty Dozen," underscoring similarities between criminal behavior and socially sanctioned violence.
Segal's "Yard" doesn't place much emphasis on subtext, although it makes some sharp satirical points by having the game attract national TV attention and several real-life sports commentators. (ESPN gets cable broadcast rights.) New version's final game, though sufficiently brutal, gets a lot more laughs than the earlier edition. Indeed, the remake as whole arguably is a slight improvement over the original, given its somewhat more disciplined tonal consistency.
Still, new pic is so faithful to its source that one major second-act plot development may be genuinely shocking to contemporary viewers (even those who have seen the original).
The final scene effectively reprises the finish of the original, right down to certain camera angles, with one novel twist: a quick cutaway to reaction shot of smiling Burt Reynolds, who appears in context to be granting his blessing to entire project.
Sandler smartly balances the script's mix of cynicism and sentiment in his ingratiating lead performance. (And he's physically persuasive as an ex-quarterback.) Reynolds' subtlety is a nifty balance to Rock's sarcasm. Cromwell provides an effective menacing counterbalance as the all-powerful warden.
Fichtner, Turturro, Tracy Morgan (as a saucy transvestite), Cloris Leachman (as a batty, horny secretary) and David Patrick Kelly (as a creepy squealer) are stand-outs among the supporting cast. Irvin effortlessly exudes natural screen presence -- as does sportscaster Jim Rome in a cameo. Look for Ed Lauter (the player-coach in '74 "Yard") in a wink-wink walk-on bit.
Slick tech package includes Dean Semler's ace lensing at the defunct Santa Fe State Penitentiary. Soundtrack includes many familiar pop standards, including the Hollies' "Long Cool Woman (in a Black Dress)" (cleverly employed for the training sequence).
In a 2001 remake of the same material, footballer-turned-actor Vinnie Jones played an imprisoned ex-soccer star who leads convicts against guards in Barry Skolnick's "Mean Machine."

Catherine Hardwicke  turns from girl problems to boy problems for Lords of Dogtown , translating Thirteen 's Angeleno teen ennui into a narrative account of the early days of skateboarding, adapted by screenwriter Stacy Peralta  from his documentary Dogtown and Z-Boys . Leaner and sharper than its fast-and-furious TV spots would let on, Lords  follows the fortunes of four skating pioneers: strutting Tony Alva  (Raising Victor Vargas  's Victor Rasuk , turned West Coast bro), brooding badass Jay Adams  (Emile Hirsch ), nebbishy runt Sid (Michael Angarano ), and teen Peralta (Elephant 's baby-faced John Robinson ), scripted by his adult self as an uptight skate wonk.
The crew starts as a gaggle of miniature beach punks, incubating in a Venice Beach  of rotting piers, zonked-out hippie parents, and the chaotic surf shop of low-rent entrepreneur Skip Engblom portrayed by Heath Ledger  as a humanoid Spuds MacKenzie  with a fly-catching SoCal drawlwho assembles the Z-Boys into a ratty competition team. Once they're recognized for their street-savvy innovative skills by the impresarios of the nascent pro circuit, Alva and Peralta zip vertically into scene stardom, while Adams descends into poorly sponsored cholo -esque delinquency, complete with bandanna and flannel.
Punctuated with legitimately engagingaction bits, grimy pavement-level sound recording, and the occasional blink of wheel-cam, the film's well-cast character study counterbalances its function as self-hagiog-raphy; Peralta carefully paints his generation with kindly brushstrokes (after positioning himself as good-kid center, whose only sin is working too hard) while skate-culture cameos by Tony Hawk  and Johnny Knoxville  (as usual, dealing instant scene death with every line) provide expected insider fan service. Channeling Amy Heckerling  for the post-emo era, Hardwicke's pop-Cassavetes melodrama nevertheless rides as smoothly as a big-budget after-school special, capturing youth struggles from an appropriately blown-out teen's-eye perspective. Parents and their professional analogues are fallible agents of love, handicapped by their own eternal West Coast adolescence. The director stagflates the film's hardscrabble '70s environs until one can almost hear the dull clinking of food stamp tokens inside a macramé purse, providing the protags with a survival-level rationale for selling out as fast as their little urethane wheels will take them.
Such is the logic of the sports biopic, in which flights of talent and ambition need best be undergirded by a morally correct narrative engine, powered by existential necessity; audiences forgive the rumbling of a stomach before the feeding of an ego. So Dogtown  's grubby recession looks like a playground romp next to Cinderella Man 's ashen Depression-era setting, an all the more appropriate motivation for its boxer-hero's brutally agonistic slugfests. Russell Crowe  updates his Gladiator  role to the 20th century, portraying real-life prizefighter Jim Braddock  as a ringside messiah whose own late-career comeback from washed-up working-class punching bag to world champeen not only feeds his starving family, but provides the sallow-fleshed masses withcoughsomething to believe in.
Despite the tale's dusty pedigree, Ron Howard  spins a ticket-worthy two-plus hours of movie-movie entertainment. Paul Giamatti  fast-talks as Braddock's suspendered manager, Joe Gould , playing the role of supportive man-spouse, after his real wife (Renée Zellweger ) hennishly urges him away from pugilism. Beat down by the nation's economic bottoming-out, Braddock lets out his class rage on the bodies of fellow travelers (in the ring, he says, "at least I know who's hittin' me") until he reaches the ultimate anger object: hulking pretty-boy Hollywood -type Max Baer  (Craig Bierko ), complete with flossy showgirl entourage and the acme of '30s rich-male villain wear, a leonine fur coat. Having killed two opponents, Baer long-arms his literally deadly head blows with a showy grin; he's a mere monocle away from functioning as a populist caricature of ruthless capitalism itself.
Howard keeps the action tight, with most of the plot used as elaborate and efficient setup for the film's climactic 20-minute battle. A few period details go a long way: Gould's barren upper-middle-class apartment, emptied of all but the attitude of wealth; sports reporters jamming on stand-up typewriters flush against ringside; Zellweger and kids stealing wood from an Esso sign after their electricity has been shut off; a boxer with a gnarly, potato-like face straight out of a WPA painting. Aside from a handful of fairy-tale motifs, riffing on the Damon Runyon -coined title, the most enigmatic reference seems to be thrown in for obscure historical touch: a bank of coming-attractions posters advertising S.O.S. Iceberg , a Leni Riefenstahl  mountain film. Not quite enough for a WW II omen, they might hint at seeing Cinderella Man  as a mythic-democratic Triumph of the Will .
Future analysts of American culture may be just as perplexed at the Adam Sandler -Chris Rock  remake of '70s comedy The Longest Yard , in which a ragtag football team of multicultural prison inmates is assembled to hit the gridiron against a steroided phalanx of Aryan Southern guardsand will no doubt ponder why an incarceration-crazy society ends up rooting for the objects of its own control anxiety as comedic underdogs. Add to this otherwise painless comedy an unmysterious obsession with feminized men as objects of ridicule, from a cleverly grotesque troupe of prison bitch cheerleaders to a tedious peppering of fops and faggots. No uplifting populism here: In a man's world, even the underdogs get their own underdogs to piss on.
