Apparently there's great mystery concerning relations between Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. Are they in love? Inquiring minds want to know, and until somebody in that relationship pounces on Oprah's Winfrey's couch with besotted confirmation, we may never.
In the meantime, there's ''Mr. & Mrs. Smith," a painfully incoherent action-comedy starring Brad and Angelina -- that's ''Brangelina" to you US Weekly readers -- as John and Jane Smith, a couple whose marriage has gone stale from years of deception. He's an assassin. So is she. And, impossibly, neither one knows about the other's day job. When John and Jane are assigned to take out the same target, he botches her job (or is it she who botches his?), and each vows to annihilate whoever it was who cost them the kill. The movie wrings droplets of fun from the fact that hunter and hunted share the same driveway, and inevitably, many shots are fired and many more things blow up.
Maybe my priorities are wrong, but this inquiring mind wants to know when these two will find a movie entirely worthy of his understatement and her naughtiness. This one has its moments, but it's also littered with action-flick junk.
The idea of marriage and the suburbs as dead zones where the young and sexy go to rot is well taken and sometimes funny. There's also a nice chase sequence in which a family minivan is driven as though it were something in ''The Matrix," while John and Jane confess their lies to each other. (She admits that she hired actors to play her parents at the wedding.) Otherwise, the movie doesn't do enough to develop the hassles of being an assassin while being a spouse.
Screenwriter Simon Kinberg and director Doug Liman are playing with a high-concept conceit -- the best way to save a blah marriage is to turn the couple into action figures -- but the movie just isn't all that diverting as an exercise in spy versus spy. The action sequences work only when successfully married (sorry) to comedy, so the Smiths are entertaining as long as they're verbally sparring. After a shootout, one Smith says, ''I missed you." The other says, ''I missed you, too."
For their parts, Pitt and Jolie are up to the task. Admittedly, it's not a terribly tall one -- Brad, sweetie, can you hold up the shoulder-mounted missile launcher and look scrumptious? Thanks -- and they're loose and fun together. But I'm getting weary of watching stars flee explosions, throw knives, and be indestructible. Are there no actual human beings left in Hollywood? Is everyone a superhero? With Jolie, it doesn't even seem like acting anymore. She's one overblown action-adventure away from becoming Chuck Norris. Next to her, Pitt looks like the minx.
The physical fights between them turn inane because you never believe they dislike each other enough to justify it. Pitt and Jolie are the rare actors who have real chemistry (they both seem a little crazy), but the movie frequently misuses it. Kinberg and Liman revel in the Smiths' unnecessary roughness, not their banter.
The rest of the cast -- which (barely) includes the lovely Kerry Washington and Adam Brody, the chic geek of ''The O.C." -- is criminally underused. Angela Bassett is the voice of John's boss, but she herself never actually appears. Neither does Keith David, who provides the voice of Jane's boss. Maybe they're better off. Vince Vaughn shows up too, playing John's manically pathetic partner. He's a hoot, but he also seems to be acting in a completely different movie.
Vaughn's presence is a reminder of what a nagging patchwork this film is -- imagine Liman's ''Swingers" (which also starred Vaughn) hammered into his ''Bourne Identity." ''Mr. & Mrs. Smith" is several films engineered to resemble one, with Liman veering from screwball to speaker-busting blockbuster to mean-spirited farce without much finesse. It evokes the conjugal animus that drove Danny DeVito's ''The War of the Roses" in 1989, but that movie was crisp, focused, and bleakly funny. This one is not.
''Mr. & Mrs. Smith" bears a vague resemblance to a 1941 Alfred Hitchcock screwball of the same name. The film was about a couple, played by Robert Montgomery and Carole Lombard, who discover their marriage is a sham. One of their marital agreements involves asking each other one question a day that must be answered honestly. This version, despite the occasional banter, is a movie of painfully few words. Initially, the Smiths don't converse for fear of actually saying something true. And in this respect, art imitates Brangelina.

         Marriages, even the happy ones, can sometimes feel like combat zones.
 
  But what if a marriage really was
 a combat zone, with the husband and wife literally trying to kill each other? And what if the spouses were really good at that sort of thing — professionally good?
 


         






    This is the world of "Mr. & Mrs. Smith," and if you think that premise sounds farfetched, especially for an action-based romantic comedy, you don't know the half of it. Plot contrivance and major league implausibility are the bread and butter of a film whose motto might be "look all you want but don't think too hard." Fortunately, when your stars are Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, looking — and listening — will keep you well satisfied.
 
  Yes, it is finally here, the film that launched a tidal wave of tabloid coverage when gossips detected the germ of a relationship between the two stars. To see "Mr. & Mrs." is to understand why everyone cared: It's hard to think of a more compellingly attractive on-screen couple. But Brad and Angelina are not just eye candy. Under Doug Liman's tutelage, they are having it both ways: enjoying themselves and each other while simultaneously sending up their public image.
 
  Working from a droll script Simon Kinberg wrote as a film school master's thesis, director Liman does what he did before in films like "Swingers" and "The Bourne Identity": bring a pleasantly offbeat and knowing sensibility to genre material.
 
  It's not that "Mr. & Mrs." doesn't have its problems. For a project that Entertainment Weekly reported went through more than 100 screenplay drafts as well as assorted reshoots, it's not surprising that the film is noticeably slow getting started and could use some trims throughout. But in the end, star charisma and Liman's style win us over and we relax into a sophisticated summertime diversion that is noticeably intended for adults.
 
  Who else but adults would recognize the film's framing device, as John and Jane Smith are introduced facing the camera and reluctantly participating in a marriage therapy session. "We don't have to be here," John grumbles, but as we listen to their answers and observe their private life, it's clear they do.
 
  The pair met cute five (or was it six?) years ago in Bogota, Colombia. Unknown to each other, both were highly skilled lone assassins who on this day were in less danger of being picked up by the police if they hooked up in the hotel bar. Each thinks the other has a square job and both assume that marriage to a civilian will provide convenient cover for their deadly activities.
 
  Unlikely as this scenario is, the next notion we have to buy into is more illogical still: In all those years of marriage neither one has so much as suspected what the other does for a living or that huge caches of weaponry are secreted around the house. It would be an impossible concept to sell without the glamour of Pitt and Jolie, which is precisely why they got the jobs.
 
  It takes about an hour for the inevitable to happen with a vengeance: In the middle of their marital crisis, the Smiths not only discover the nature of their spouses' careers, they also end up being assigned to kill each other by the competing organizations they work for. James Bond never had problems like this.
 
  It is at this point that "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" begins to entertain us in earnest by juggling some droll simultaneous happenings, starting with the notion that a series of mishaps and misunderstandings makes it seem to each of the Smiths that the other is actually trying to kill him or her, triggering an understandably lethal reaction.
 
  At the same time, the Smiths are bickering as only married people can, trying, in classic talk-it-out tropes, to save their relationship. Lines like "don't go to sleep angry" and "where there is no trust, there can be no love" acquire an amusing resonance when played out against a backdrop of focused mayhem. As Mr. Smith explains to a third party just before threatening to dismember him, "The missus and I are working through some domestic issues."
 
  Aided by Liman, both Pitt and Jolie prove themselves adept at the kind of arch innuendo the script demands. And Liman himself, though he can't resist an excessive hyper-action finale, orchestrates a number of touches that generate smiles.
 
  There's "Swingers" veteran Vince Vaughn as Mr. Smith's partner Eddie, who replies to a simple greeting with a shambling "Same old, same old; people need killing." There's the film's unexpected use of music — in one particularly adroit case pairing "Express Yourself" with a scene of hand-to-hand combat.
 
  Most of all what Liman does here is make fun seem like fun. It's a harder thing to accomplish than might be imagined.

In Mr. & Mrs. Smith , Doug Liman's winkingly decadent ballistic domestic screwball comedy, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie play married assassins who spend a great deal of time trying to kill each other, first with words, then with extremely large tech-chic assault weapons. The movie revels in its bemused overkill, which is fun for a while before it grows wearisome, but there's no denying that the mutual hostility looks good on the two stars. Even if they didn't have gossip headlines to ricochet off of, Pitt and Jolie flirt with expert timing, and they're never sexier than when they're biting each other's heads off. It helps, of course, that the two are ideally matched physical specimens, with a his-and-hers set of bee-stung lips  his, if anything, are even poutier  and a shared attitude of come-hither carnality. Pitt's heavy-lidded gaze makes it look as if he were stoned on the happy knowledge of what a sun-god pinup he is, and Jolie, with her naughty yet playful hellcat snarl, is perhaps his first female costar to come on like she could eat him for breakfast.
The two start out as a parody of the perfect upper-middle-class couple. In a white mini-mansion in the leafy New York suburbs, John Smith (Pitt) arrives home each evening, mixes a martini, and banters with his wife, Jane (Jolie), about such pressing matters as whether the new drapes she just hung will work with the old couch. Mr. & Mrs. Smith  opens in a lively, tossed-off way, with a marital-counseling ''tune-up'' session peppered with just enough funny, awkward pauses and euphemisms to suggest that the Smiths aren't quite as open with one another as they pretend to be.
Each, it turns out, is a clandestine assassin, employed by rival agencies, with their weapons stashed in hidden compartments around the house (his are inside a chamber below the garage, hers are kept under the impeccably renovated wall oven). The two slip out, unbeknownst to the other, to make a killing, which they accomplish with the ease of those used to wielding only the most upscale utensils. She poses as a dominatrix in black leather and then makes a getaway worthy of Catwoman, as he stumbles, apparently drunk, into a poker game, only to ace everyone in the room.
In its violently far-fetched way, Mr. & Mrs. Smith  invites us to  view John and Jane Smith as an action-comedy extension of every couple who have ever concealed, out of love and civility, a handful of innocuous ''little things,'' only to see those routine marital fibs coalesce over the years into a secrecy zone of nagging mistrust. The movie's pivotal joke, and it's a good one, is that the Smiths, by concealing their sociopathic professions from each other, have conspired without knowing it in the classic bourgeois marital charade. They've stowed away their anger, and their amorous sparks along with it. It's only fitting, then, that when they're both assigned to terminate the same target in the middle of the desert, a glitch  or is it?  that ends up outing their identities, they feel conned, lied to, betrayed. And, in a weird way, turned on. Ordered by their respective agencies to assassinate each other, they go about the task all too eagerly, even as their smackdown-to-the-death revives why they fell for each other in the first place.
There are many precedents for a comedy of barbed love played out through action. One thinks of Romancing the Stone , the 1999 remake of The Thomas Crown Affair , the underrated Entrapment , that blitzkrieg divorce bash The War of the Roses , the Thin Man  films, or even the original exercise in espionage screwball, the '60s TV series The Avengers . I wish I could say that Mr. & Mrs. Smith  was every bit as enjoyable, but for all the nimbleness of its first half and the chemical zing of Pitt and Jolie, the film devolves into a fractious and explosive mess, hitting the same note of ''ironic'' violence over and over.
Once the Smiths have been unmasked, the cleverness begins to leak out of Simon Kinberg's script, and the movie loses its jovial and gamelike atmosphere of deception. John and Jane attempt to blow each other away, trashing their house in the process, only to realize that they're better off joining forces. Liman stages an endless highway chase, full of back talk and bullets, that might have been a knockout had the banter been one-tenth as ingenious as the kamikaze staging. I realize that we're supposed to simply go with the high-megaton flow, but Mr. & Mrs. Smith , by turning into a hip comedy of wreckage, doesn't just steamroll the sexy bond of its stars. It overwhelms itself.

 And so here we have Mr. and Mrs. Smith - young, married and bored. Every day, Mr. and Mrs. Smith rise from their cold bed, drink their hot coffee, drive off in their gleaming imports. Their overlarge house is impeccably appointed, and their lawn as carefully manicured as a bowling green. But we know the joke: Mr. and Mrs. Smith are professional assassins (we've seen the slyly funny ads), and because they are played by beautiful movie stars who heat up the gossip rags like hydrogen bombs, we also know this film can't be about anything as dreary as happily ever after. To have and to chokehold -  that's the multiplex ticket.  Of course, Mr. and Mrs. Smith are, as anyone with a pulse must be aware, played by Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, beautiful movie stars who can also be exceptionally fine actors. Fine acting is generally not part of the equation when it comes to deterministically high-concept vehicles like "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," which wring profits and thrills from that classic American mix of sexual titillation and hard-core violence. What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing and occasionally incoherent action. Sometimes Mr. Pitt and Ms. Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their new joint venture is alternately a  goof and a drag.  The film was directed by Doug Liman, whose earlier credits include the tasty pop treat "Go" and the equally excellent action adventure "The Bourne Identity." Mr. Liman, who made a splash with "Swingers," an indie trifle about guys on the town and on the make, is a pop savant with a core of  seriousness. "Go" and "The Bourne Identity" both look and sound cool and move to the quicksilver rhythms of Gen A.D.D. With their flicker editing, narrative drive and revved-up soundtracks, these are movies made for plugged-in, hard-wired audiences for whom multitasking isn't a modern complaint but an objective fact. In other words, anyone weaned on MTV, Michael Bay, the Internet, PlayStation and commercial music and doesn't see what the big deal is.  The lightness of Mr. Liman's touch in both "Go" and "The Bourne Identity," his ability to fluidly move through  frenetic action and the periodic moment of downtime,    makes these films very easy to watch. But what  makes each film more than just another disposable entertainment is its underlying gravitas, something that at times  resembles sincerity. Even the casting of both the spooky Canadian actress Sarah Polley, the hub  of the multistoried "Go," and Matt Damon, the unsmiling star of "Bourne," gives each of these films more gravity than they may have had otherwise. It's funny when the amnesiac Bourne realizes he speaks German and can throw a mean punch; it's unexpectedly affecting when the woman he's with vomits after she sees another man violently die.  Neither that  buoyancy  nor that   weight are  in evidence in Mr. Liman's latest effort, a genre hybrid that combines comedy and action to awkward effect. The undernourished screenplay was Simon Kinberg's thesis project at Columbia University, where it's possible he came across Stanley Cavell's book "Pursuits of Happiness," about a cinematic subgenre the Harvard professor calls "the comedy of remarriage." Such 1930's and early 1940's comedies as "The Awful Truth" and "The Philadelphia Story," Mr. Cavell writes, ask the question, "What does a happy marriage sound like?" In these films, filled with cascades of bright chatter, the war of the sexes is waged with words. In "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," that war is fought with all manner of weaponry, mostly guns, and few memorable words.  The film opens with the two stars sitting side by side in separate chairs and facing the camera. It soon becomes apparent that Mr. and Mrs. Smith are enduring some kind of therapy session, since they are fielding personal questions from an off-camera man with the soothing voice (William Fichtner) you hear selling antidepressants on television. Fidgety and visibly uncomfortable, the pair swat away questions with boilerplate responses, coming to an abrupt halt when the topic shifts to coitus. There's a familiar he-said,  she-said dynamic at play in this exchange: he forgets how many years they have been together and she corrects him with a tight smile. The whole thing is pretty flabby, but it does establish that Mrs. Smith (and perhaps Ms. Jolie) does not suffer much of anything lightly.  After a  chaotic trip down memory lane, when John met Jane amid a hailstorm of bullets in Bogotá, Colombia, Mr. and Mrs. Smith discover their mutual subterfuge and quickly experience the agonies of betrayal. The difference being that, instead of throwing a plate against the wall or lobbing an ashtray at their beloved, they lock and load. That's pretty much the entire film, or what passes for its story. Each partner works for a clandestine agency - though her power suite looks like the editorial beehive at a high-end fashion magazine, while his is more mom-and-pop junky. One of the film's slow-to-boil jokes is that Mrs. Smith may be a lot better at her job than her husband, a gag that isn't hard to buy, given Ms. Jolie's thousand-mile stare.  Stuff happens - mostly the couple try to kill each other and, in time, swarms of heavily armed guys in black try to kill them. Vince Vaughn does a straining, unfunny riff on his "Swingers" persona, but it's not money, baby, it's tired and flat. There is no one else really worth mentioning because, in truth, this is the Brad and Angelina show and not much more. That's too bad, because both actors are capable of more. At times a reluctant movie star, Mr. Pitt does not always share the screen easily, but in "Ocean's Eleven" he settled into a smooth   groove with George Clooney, perhaps because he didn't have to carry the burden of beauty alone. That movie showed he could pair up nicely; all he needed was his own Rosalind Russell.  What he gets here is Gloria Grahame, Susan Hayward and Ann Savage (the two-bit temptress from the noir "Detour") rolled into one intimidating package. Ms. Jolie's singular beauty and preternatural intensity have failed to give her many worthy roles, but whenever she is onscreen you can't take your eyes off her. Her beauty makes her as pleasurable viewing as Mr. Pitt, but her intensity also means that she upends this film's delicate balance of hard action and soft romance. In the comedy of remarriage, men and women struggle to become equals; these are movies in which the war of the sexes more or less ends in a tie. All it takes is five minutes with Ms. Jolie to realize that Mrs. Smith could wipe the floor with Mr. Smith and probably burns for nothing more.  "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It features a great deal of intense if relatively bloodless gun violence and the occasional thrown knife.  Mr. and Mrs.

Marital therapy acquires life-or-death ramifications in "Mr. & Mrs. Smith," an exhaustingly elaborate romantic fantasy actioner. Built on the cutesy premise that a great-looking husband and wife are paid killers without the other knowing about it, the at-least $110 million two-hander pirouettes entirely on the script's whimsical approach to serious business and the charm generated by leads Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. But it doesn't take long for the souffle to fall. Fox is doing everything possible to assure a big near-worldwide opening June 10, which the two stars should help foster, but B.O. legs don't look as long as those of the leading lady.
Okay, this isn't "Gigli," perhaps the last big studio film to boast a similar complement of combustible on-and-off screen romance, production delays and budget overruns. On the other hand, it certainly isn't "Trouble in Paradise," the Ernst Lubitsch classic that stands as the model of a romantic comedy about two competing criminals who fall in love. Nor does it have anything to do with Alfred Hitchcock's 1941 film of the same title -- the director's only outright comedy.
Originally penned by scenarist-du-jour Simon Kinberg ("XXX: State of the Union," "Fantastic Four") as his thesis for a master's degree at Columbia, "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" essentially takes the view that, as passion and excitement in marriage is destined to fade, what a couple needs is a little mortal combat to spice it up.
Well, whatever turns you on, but be warned that the marital aids on display here cost a tad more than those on offer at the neighborhood adult toys shop; they include enough state-of-the-art spy equipment, computer gear, heavy artillery and shiny kitchen utensils to assure the successful invasion of a medium-sized country.
The couple's meet-cute actually is, as John (Pitt) and Jane (Jolie) are thrown together under mutual duress in Bogota. When you look like these two, one thing leads to another very quickly; Pitt and Jolie hardly need any sexing up as it is, but they are lavished with visual caresses by director Doug Liman and lenser Bojan Bazelli to an extraordinary degree, which certainly makes the picture easy on the eye.
Five or six years later (they can never agree on which), the Smiths are living in acute domestic luxury, with a pinch of marital fatigue in the equation, alluded to in a succession of straight-to-camera therapy sessions that prove alternately amusing and coy. The truth about their identical professions, their proficiency at what they do and the effectiveness of their lies to each other over the stretch of the marriage emerge in the vigorous intercutting of respective hits they pull off on one busy New York City night.
But their next jobs prove disastrous: They are assigned to take out the same guy at the same time by their respective unnamed agencies. The way they keep their mutual realizations of these circumstances secret -- and then try to rub out each other -- generates the only mild intrigue the piece can manage.
Thereafter, the film tries, but fails, to build an emotional head of steam from the idea that the torrent of truth-telling they kick-start to make up for five (or is it six?) years of lying provides the basis for a new-and-improved marriage.
This is one of those films for which viewers willing to buy into the premise might happily go along for the ride. For those who find it resistible, if not preposterous, however, "Mr. & Mrs. Smith" proves a very long haul indeed. The sheer weight and volume of mayhem toward the end is numbing and meaningless, and two hours is a good 25 minutes more than such a frail conceit can sustain.
As he proved on "Go" and "The Bourne Identity," Liman can shoot the hell out of a scene, coming up with fresh angles and details to put ordinary happenings in sharp relief. But despite deft pacing within individual sequences and an admirable talent for throwaway humor, it's mostly overkill here, a case of far too much care and polish and money lavished upon too fragile an idea.
Pitt and Jolie feint, banter and attack with aplomb, their movie-star wattage providing the only plausible excuse for paying attention to the shenanigans parading across the screen; when they're old, they might well think back on this moment as the time when they looked their best. But they certainly won't be able to consider it their best film.
Vince Vaughn contributes some manic humor as John's disheveled mama's boy boss, a funny character conception. Everyone else comes and goes quickly.
Technically, pic is a dream of fabulous textural surfaces, luminous locations and exquisite lighting. John Powell's frisky score is augmented by a CD full of international-flavored tunes and covers.

Just in time for wedding season, the beleaguered institution of matrimony takes a few more hits. A pair of two-handers this week file bruising dispatches from the conjugal front lines that should have defense-of-marriage conservatives weeping into their white-rose corsages. The feuding couples in Mr. & Mrs. Smith  and 5x2  are half a decade into unions that have turned stagnant and sour. Both movies are about how love dies, borrowing respectively from The War of the Roses and Scenes From a Marriage , but where the Hollywood  blockbuster strives to spice things up with some therapeutic, s/m-tinged role-play, the European art film  pronounces its exhausted relationship dead at the start and splits open the still warm corpse for an unflinching autopsy.
The failed marriage that is the true subject of Mr. & Mrs. Smith  is, of course, not the one on-screen (between two assassins played by Brad Pitt  and Angelina Jolie ). Extratextual white noise drowns out everything else herewhich is to say, most viewers will be studying this film for clues to, as a recent Us Weekly   headline put it, "how Angelina stole Brad." (The movie supports some of the magazine's extensively researched theories, in particular "She's Flirtatious!" and "She's Fun!" but is inconclusive on others, like "She Lives in the Now!") Beleaguered by last-minute personnel changes and costly reshoots, Doug Liman 's romantic caper has benefited from increasingly breathless free publicity since the Pitt-Aniston split, and seems to have been shaped accordingly. Overlong at nearly two hours, the movie alternates between busy action high jinks and what passes for repose: ogling its stars, a default mode that's hard to argue with given the freakish hotness of the tabloid wet dream that is the Brangelina.
Unrelated to the Hitchcock comedy of the same name, Mr. & Mrs. Smith  coasts on a gimmicky premise that Hollywood's new favorite scenarist Simon Kinberg  (XXX: State of the Union ) concocted for his Columbia master's thesis. After a stressful meet-cute in Bogotá John and Jane take the plunge but continue to lead furtive separate lives: Ensconced in opulent, picket fence suburbia, each remains improbably oblivious to the fact that the other kills for a living. His is a low-rent outer-borough business (run by a schlubby, richly hammy Vince Vaughn ), hers a Manhattan-based Kill Bill meetsCharlie's Angels  all-girl operation. When both are assigned to (and botch) the same jobjust as their marital woes are worseningtheir cover is blown and they're instructed to dispose of each other.
The tail-chasing symmetry of the scenario recalls the yin-yang stalemates of Face/Off  and Infernal Affairs , and Liman, generally an agile, inventive director, opts for a pleasing, Hong Kongstyle insouciance. The shoot-outs have a John Woo worthy panache, all slo-mo exaggeration and two-fisted bullet sprays. (Woo was in fact briefly attached to the project before Liman.) A tongue-in-cheek allegory on the hazards of harboring secrets in a relationship, Mr. & Mrs. Smith  is most entertaining when the Smiths are hell-bent on mutual annihilationgoing from covert plotting to naked hostility. The prospect of a hot hate fuck looms tantalizingly, but Liman defuses the sexual simmer much too early with a PG-13 reconciliation, leaving Jolie and Pitt little to do but preen and cutely bicker. There's something of an anti-bourgeois streak beneath the gleaming surfaces, as suggested by the gleeful destruction of the Smiths' showroom-ready stainless-steel kitchen (not to mention the winking presence of a Fight Club  T-shirt). But a braver movie would have seen the couple's standoff through to its logical conclusionthe eventual insistence on happily ever after seems more than a little weaselly, given the off-camera divorce that has served as Mr. & Mrs. Smith 's most effective coming attraction.
