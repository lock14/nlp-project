It's working-class England, 1960. A Jamaican family moves in next door to the Jewish Wisemans, whose young David (Sam Smith) is a kid so wide-eyed he likes to exclaim ''Wondrous oblivion!'' to self-diagnose his own wide-eyedness. Soon David is learning a lot about cricket  and racial tolerance, natch  from his good neighbor (Delroy Lindo, who's the best thing here). Wondrous Oblivion  goes awry in its sloppy racial drama, and although the cricket-training montages are good, they're still training montages, and this is just that kind of overfamiliar movie.

Form and content fight to the death in “Wondrous Oblivion,” Paul Morrison’s defiantly gauzy tale of racial friction in 1960s England. Bathed in a peachy glow that initially seems appropriate, the movie follows 11-year-old David Wiseman (Sam Smith), a cricket-obsessed Jewish boy who lives with his émigré parents in a working-class suburb of South London. When the Samuelses, a lively Jamaican family, move in next door, the local gossips are horrified, but David’s parents, Ruth and Victor (Emily Woof and Stanley Townsend), are guiltily relieved to have neighborhood prejudice diverted to a new target. The families grow closer, however, when Dennis Samuels (a terrific Delroy Lindo) helps David improve his cricket game and, impressively shirtless, fixes Ruth’s broken washing machine. Suddenly, what began as an innocent coming-of-age tale swerves into adult territory as Dennis introduces Ruth to ska music and dirty dancing. While the oblivious Victor toils in the family store and the movie builds to a major tragedy, Ruth succumbs to a powerful crush. “You awakened something in me,” she breathes at Dennis over the garden fence, golden light dancing in her hair. Douglas Sirk would have been proud. Seven years ago, with the uncompromisingly bleak “Solomon and Gaenor,” Mr. Morrison handled bigotry with the darkness it deserves. In “Wondrous Oblivion,” he serves up prejudice over easy, joining the ranks of too many filmmakers who suggest that sports and sexual flirtation can cure all social ills. We wish.

A young Jewish kid in '60s England finds social fulfillment through his love of cricket in "Wondrous Oblivion," latest entry in the burgeoning field of sport-as-social-healer pictures. Full of charming moments, but swinging hither and thither between mainstream entertainment and an over-cooked anti-racist tract, this second feature by Paul Morrison looks set for moderate innings at theatrical wickets rather than the higher score it could have batted in the hands of a more commercially oriented director.
Though made far more for adults than tykes, film recently won the top prize at Italy's Giffoni kidfest; U.K. preem is scheduled at the Edinburgh fest Aug. 17, followed by a nationwide release in October.
Pic follows other non-U.S. movies in which sport acts as a national booster. Indian yarn "Lagaan," set during British Empire days, also dealt with cricket; soccer was kicked around by both "Mean Machine" and "Bend It Like Beckham." Upcoming are Soenke Wortmann's German soccer dramedy, "The Miracle of Bern," and Mel Smith's contempo British comedy, "Blackball," centered on, uh, lawn bowling.
Despite its sports theme, "Oblivion" has several parallels with Morrison's debut pic, "Solomon and Gaenor" (1999), an artsy but interesting Romeo and Juliet-like drama set in the Welsh Valleys in 1911. As well as sharing a subtext of tolerance, and stirring in some socio-political background, "Oblivion" even has a similarly downbeat, chiaroscuro look in its interiors, with Nina Kellgren encoring as d.p., though this time in widescreen.
Only in the brighter exterior scenes featuring cricket does the movie, in tandem with Ilona Sekacz's buoyant score, give hints of the pure crowd-pleaser it could have become.
Setting is a working-class neighborhood in south London, 1960. David Wiseman (Sam Smith) is an 11-year-old Jewish kid whose parents -- Polish-born tailor Victor (Stanley Townsend) and his young German-born wife, Ruth (Emily Woof) -- have poured everything into giving him a good education at a posh private school. Cricket is David's obsession, but the closest he comes to playing it is with cigarette cards of famous players. (In an unnecessary, rather spotty fantasy strand of the movie, these take on a life of their own in his eyes.)
When a Jamaican family moves into the neighborhood, the vanilla residents are horrified. Despite his parents' warnings, David cautiously becomes pals with the father, Dennis Samuels (Delroy Lindo), who's also a cricket nut.
Opening reels are played in a light enough way, with white neighbors registering shock at the Samuels blithely laying out a cricket pitch and protective nets in their back garden, where Dennis coaches his young daughter, Judy (Leonie Elliott).
Production designer Eve Stewart's large studio set (built at Shepperton) for the adjacent back gardens gives the film a slightly unreal look, which actually works well alongside Kellgren's lensing, digitally re-graded to give a slightly grubby period feel, and Anushia Nieradzik's detailed costuming.
When David turns up one day in full cricket gear to play in Dennis' garden, the movie really looks like it's getting going, but it soon becomes clear writer-helmer Morrison has several other fish to fry.
David's mother Ruth finds herself drawn to the older, kindly Dennis -- a relationship that progresses by increments into something that threatens to get out of hand.
Meanwhile, David, with Dennis' coaching, has improved his game, and he's finally given a chance by his cricket coach, Mr. Pugh (Jo Stone-Fewings, in a dryly ironic performance), to play on the school team. However, as David is "accepted" by his English schoolmates, a rift opens between the Wisemans and Samuels. Then David is selected for a vital cricket match against another school.
Pic often works well, with some beautifully observed comic moments -- Angela Wynter is especially good as Dennis' naively friendly wife -- but there's an unsettling tug between several different movies trying to get out. One, about race relations in early '60s Britain, is initially launched through some over-expository dialogue between David's parents and boils over near the end in an attack by some white youths that temporarily derails the pic.
Another movie is the affair between Ruth and Dennis, which contains some of the most sensitively played and directed scenes in the movie, but is flawed by the characters being too schematic. As Ruth, Woof sports an oy-vey accent you could cut with a knife, and Lindo is saddled with a goody-two-shoes black character who's only allowed one brief scene to show any anger.
The third movie, and the one which should dominate, is that of David and cricket, a clear metaphor for learning to grow up wanting "to be in a team" (in the words of Pugh). In a willful decision not to go for the more commercial option -- a finale centered around the crucial cricket match -- helmer-writer Morrison ends on a rosy but quieter note, over-obviously celebrating solidarity between minorities rather than a broader message. That's a shame, as the picture works best as a pan-human comedy with warm touches, rather than as a finger-wagging lecture.
Still, despite the blandness of his character, Lindo is very good as gentle giant Dennis, communicating a real joy in cricket that spills over into Smith's likable, unexaggerated perf as David. Playing, in general, is of a high standard, with Townsend quietly impressive as the kid's wise father.

In a parallel universe of socially conscious dramas, there exists a movie in which a staid white British family moves into a lively community of black Jamaicans. After some initial mistrust, the Jamaicans find themselves moved, even ennobled by the uptight aloofness of their new neighbors. The youngest Brit mesmerizes the rudeboys next door with his collection of soul-free, pathetically unhip pop, and the mother teaches the warm, affectionate Jamaican men how to repress their feelings in clenched neurosis. Soon the entire block is living in tight-assed, stiff-upper-lipped harmony.
Ours, though, is the world of Wondrous Oblivion , which in outline follows a well-worn problem-drama path: A lively Jamaican family moves into a resentful white working- class British neighborhood, offering friendship and a glimpse of a happier, less buttoned-down life to the staid folks next door. But if writer-director Paul Morrison 's film traces a predictable arc from racial unease to acceptance, it's often winningand sometimes tough-mindedin the details.
A family of Polish and German Jews displaced by the Holocaust to South London , the Wisemans are themselves outsiders. "Not all immigrants are alike, I'm sure," coos hateful Mrs. Dunkley (Mary Cunningham ) to timid Wiseman matriarch Ruth (Emily Woof ), a former child bride abashed by motherhood, semi-hostile surroundings, and the stern, stoic presence of husband Victor (Stanley Townsend ).
In his room, 11-year-old David (Sam Smith ) nurses his obsession with cricket. Reduced to manning the scoreboard at his upper-crust boys' school, David longs to see real action on the cricket team. The chance arrives when he looks out his window and spies his controversial new neighbors: a relocated Kingston  foundry worker, Dennis Samuels  (Delroy Lindo ), whose first order of business is to turn the narrow back garden into a cricket pitch for his daughter Judy (Leonie Elliott ).
The patchwork of backyard gardens gives Wondrous Oblivion  an oddly rosy, almost fairy-tale feelwhich has the unfortunate effect of making the neighborhood's racism seem like something that happened long ago, distantly remembered. The setting is the indeterminate 1960s: A newsreel announcer mentions the 1960 cricket championships, but when Dennis and Judy become David's trainers, a montage charts his progress to Dandy Livingstone 's 1967 ska classic "Rudy, a Message to You."
The selection signifies the movie's good intentions. When the Specials cut the song in the late 1970s, it added fuel to Britain's short-lived Two Tone movement, whose interracial bands tried to bring down boundaries between black and white by fusing loping Jamaican beats with Brit-punk energy. Two-tone could also describe Wondrous Oblivion  itselfwhich not only vacillates between innocuous fancy and real menace, sometimes awkwardly, but also maintains a rather nervy balance between a light coming- of-age drama for children and a darker, more adult story of deferred passions.
As David spends more time with Dennis and Judy, drawing suspicion and outright threats from the bigots on the block, his neglected mother watches her new neighbor in an erotic trance. Morrison stages the growing attraction between Ruth and Dennis in terms of the charged, gradually declining space that separates them, from a brush of bodies during a kitchen mishap to an aching slow dance at a secret ska outing. The lack of privacy that makes the neighborhood a hotbed of gossip and unrest gives their moments of fleeting contact an edge of real danger. Meanwhile, David's emerging cricket prowess forces him to make a choice between their company and Judy'sa test he fails, badly.
This sequence and its repercussions give Wondrous Oblivion  a moral heft and insight far beyond its simplistic melodrama. Part of growing up is making mistakes that can't be taken back, only lived with: The way Smith's David sinks facedown into his bed afterward evokes the crushing weight a child feels the first time he realizes some actions have consequences that can't be undone.
Teaching David what's cricket, in every sense, and awakening Ruth's libidoand gallantly refusing her attempted seduction is a lot of magic for one Magic Negro, and the role of Dennis as written remains stubbornly idealized. But as Lindo plays him, Dennis has a coiled anger that shows only in glimpses. Ruth and David begin to watch the family next door through veiled windows, peering at a domestic warmth that seems alien: Something about Lindo's unguarded bearing in these glimpses suggests a person and a world closed off not just to their view, but to the movie's. Maybe in some parallel universe, there's a version of Wondrous Oblivion  told from the viewpoint of Dennis and Judyin which we learn that, for the characters on their side of the fence, the condition of the title doesn't exist.
