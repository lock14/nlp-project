"The more he grew as an artist, the lower he sank as a person," says Lopez as Puchi Lavoe, widow of Eighties salsa sensation Hector Lavoe. The person she's talking about is totally irrelevant, however. It's the formula that counts: the rise-and-fall trajectory that drives every Behind the Music
-style docudrama. Unfortunately, there's little more than formula in Ichaso's El Cantante
, a biopic about the singer known as Lavoe � or "the voice." His rise from the beaches of Puerto Rico to the pinnacle of New York's rising salsa movement and Nuyorican community is shown as meteoric and trouble-free, his descent into drug addiction and unreliability appears endless and endlessly enabled, the love of his wife Puchi is instant and eternal. So what if the movie skips over all the musician's artistic and personal struggles and misses a great opportunity to reveal historic aspects of Latin music culture? As Lavoe, Anthony comes to life whenever he's onstage and singing, although appearancewise he does nothing to mimic the appearance of the singer but wear Lavoe's signature aviator glasses and feathered hairstyle. Anthony's real-life wife, Lopez, plays Puchi and also produced the film. The couple's chemistry onscreen is real (and erases all fears of another Gigli
), but Puchi's constant presence makes the film seem like it's a common love triangle about a man, a woman, and his stash. The screenplay by Ichaso, David Darmstaedter, and Todd Anthony Bello hardly misses a music clich�, which is too bad because Ichaso (Pi�ero
, Crossover Dreams
) and cinematographer Claudio Chea create a vibrant sense of period Nuyorican flavor and dance-hall exuberance. Yet significant events in the lives of this couple (such as the death of their son) are rendered unclearly and only add to the sense of having discovered very little through El Cantante
.


The salsa explosion of the 1970s has long deserved a movie that would capture the music, the energy, and the loud, proud fusion of Puerto Rican and New York rhythms. Ideally, it would give you a sense of an entire people knocking the planet off its axis with a shake of their hips.
If only "El Cantante" were that movie. Instead, it's a curiously sludgy cross between a Doomed Star biopic and a J. Lo vanity project. Director Leon Ichaso ("Pinero," "Crossover Dreams") knows this turf better than perhaps any filmmaker out there, but even he can't do much with the story of Hector Lavoe (1946-1993), one of the key singing voices of early salsa and, in this account, a self-absorbed, drug-addicted heel.
Salsa superstar Marc Anthony plays Lavoe, and Jennifer Lopez -- Mrs. Anthony -- plays Lavoe's wife, Nilda "Puchi" Rosado. (Lopez also co-produced the film.) "El Cantante" tells their story chronologically, returning every so often to a black-and-white interview sequence, set in 2002, in which Puchi defensively discusses her late husband. "People should remember he was funny," she insists against all the evidence onscreen.
After a street-singing prologue in 1963 Puerto Rico, the boy born Hector Perez journeys to New York City against his father's wishes, quickly learning the musical ropes. In too short order, he's meeting bandleader and salsa impresario Johnny Pacheco (Nelson Vasquez), who signs the kid up as vocalist in trombonist Willie Colon's (John Ortiz) band and welcomes him to the Fania Records family. But first a name change. "Perez is an unemployment line name," says Pacheco, rechristening him Hector Lavoe -- French for "the voice."
Hector discovers heroin and Puchi around the same time, and neither will turn out to be very good for him. By now "El Cantante" is cooking nicely, though, with sharply edited scenes in streets and uptown apartment parties that groove with timbale-fueled cross-rhythms. Colon/Lavoe hits like "Che Che Cole" and "Aguanile" leap off the screen with nearly the force they must have possessed in the early 1970s. If Anthony has a brighter, more aggressive vocal presence than the real Lavoe's confident drawl, you're too busy dancing in your seat to be bothered.
Then comes the descent. Hector starts missing gigs, exasperating Colon and the Fania team. He shows up stoned for his wedding (Puchi's pregnant, as is one of the singer's other girlfriends). He has a breakdown, gets institutionalized, eventually contracts HIV from who knows where. "El Cantante" devotes more than half of its running time to this slow, ugly fall from grace, and the saddest part is that the movie tells us nothing that dozens of similar famous-junkie tales haven't. We've retreated from the vibrant world of Latin music to a generalized tailspin.
If the script or Anthony offered any insights as to why Hector doped or why we should care, that would be one thing, but the star -- like many famous singers tackling an acting role -- hides behind his shades and hairdo. Both character and performance remain passive ciphers. Where's the ambition? Where's the passion?
In the meantime, Lopez hijacks the movie while fuzzing the question of how much Puchi enabled her husband. "El Cantante" presents the character as a roughneck Bronx party girl who loved the high life in all its dimensions but fought -- not too hard -- to keep Hector on the straight and narrow. Puchi bristles when one of the interviewers mutters she's partly to blame, but the movie pulls back from a similar judgment, either out of deference to its producer-star or to keep Latin music's skeletons in the closet.
Ortiz's Colon gets boxed out of the film in contradiction of his impact on Lavoe's career. Even the title signature tune doesn't square in this telling. "El Cantante" includes a nightclub scene in which a young Ruben Blades (Victor Manuelle), who wrote the song, presents it to Hector as a gift. In fact, Blades wanted to record it himself but was pressured by Colon to offer it to the troubled singer.
In the end, whatever drove this talented man to sing and to kill himself with drugs remains unknown. Maybe he was fleeing fame. Maybe he just liked being high. "Men like Hector, they don't get therapy," says Puchi. They don't get honest movie biographies, either.


''It was like, the more he grew as an artist, the more he sank as a person,'' says Puchi Perez (Jennifer Lopez, naggy), speaking of her late husband, salsa vocalist Héctor Lavoe (Marc Anthony, saggy). Actually, it wasn't like  that; it was  that, according to El Cantante , a conventional, brassy blat of a biopic. Director/co-writer Leon Ichaso's decision to settle for a familiar Detrás de la Musica del VH1  arc  humble beginnings, sudden fame, tragic excess, fall from grace  makes his subject's tormented life feel reenactment-flat. ''He was funny,'' says Puchi. Really? Because here, the sad clown who once posed on an album cover as Chaplin comes off as merely...sad.
Certainly, Lavoe's life conforms to our ingrained notion of pop tragedy. With Nuyorican trombonist Willie Colón, he cemented the salsa sound of the'60s and '70s with genre-defining tracks like ''El Malo'' and ''Aguanile.'' But where, within Lavoe,  did that sunny sound originate? And how did it square with his thunderously dark depression and resultant drug binges? Ichaso, who was clearly hired to shoot some hybrid of a home movie and a circa 1992 music video, asks these questions only out of narrative obligation and doesn't bother to supply answers. Anthony, with his famished thousand-yard stare, turns in a delicate  perhaps  too  delicate  performance more informed by the shadow of Lavoe's death (from AIDS in 1993) than the spark of his art. And his shrill domestic scenes with Lopez feel small and squalid, as we wait restlessly for the band to play us out.

 On the evidence of “El Cantante,” in which he plays the salsa singer Héctor Lavoe, Marc Anthony is not much of a screen actor. When the character is not in front of an audience, Mr. Anthony seems to recede behind his high, delicate cheekbones and tinted glasses, as the director, Leon Ichaso, buries him in distracting formal gimmicks and camera stunts. For the viewer Mr. Lavoe remains out of reach, an artist whose inner life remains locked inside the actor’s diffidence.  Whenever Héctor  takes the stage, however, Mr. Anthony unleashes his charisma, and shows that, whatever his limitations as an actor, he is a brilliant performer. Singing new versions of hits from various periods in Mr. Lavoe’s career — from records he made with Willie Colón and the Fania All-Stars in the late ’60s and early ’70s as well as from later solo projects — he demonstrates that this music is a complex and captivating form of drama in its own right.  As the main vocal line swoops and dips above the throb of percussion, the chatter of horns and the chanted background voices, his voice negotiates a dizzying array of emotions and attitudes. He is by turns boastful and vulnerable, nostalgic and defiant, sentimental and sarcastic.  Mr. Ichaso’s generosity with these musical moments compensates both for Mr. Anthony’s shortcomings and for the frenetic incoherence of his own storytelling. It also helps that Jennifer Lopez, married to Mr. Anthony and a producer of “El Cantante,” does enough acting for the two of them in her role as Puchi, Héctor’s wife. The film is structured around scenes of Puchi in 2002, reminiscing to a film crew about her life with her husband, who died of complications from AIDS in 1993.  A hectic rush of flashbacks take us to the ’80s and then back to the ’60s, when young Héctor Perez, as he was then known, is preparing to leave his native Puerto Rico for New York. His father tells him not to go, and the next thing you know he’s arriving in the city (apparently along with the Beatles). He meets some musicians, makes eyes at Puchi (whose own eyes are decorated with some impressive false lashes) and moves quickly from his first puff of marijuana to full-blown heroin addiction.  This story, which quickly comes to resemble the plot of nearly every other musical biopic of recent memory, develops through an exhausting, confusing series of montages punctuated by short, crude moments of ham-fisted melodrama. Shortly after Héctor  meets Puchi, he takes her to meet his sister, and the scene lasts long enough for two thoughts to cross your mind: Wait, he has a sister? and, What are she and Puchi fighting about?  Ms. Lopez brings a lot of fight to her performance, a hard, skeptical edge that makes Puchi a more interesting and plausible character than her husband. It falls to her to explain him, since neither Mr. Anthony nor Mr. Ichaso seem able or willing to do so. She tells us that Héctor  had a great sense of humor, that he was “corny” and that “the more he grew as an artist, the deeper he sank as a person.”  “El Cantante” shows us the second half of this process, as Héctor  takes more drugs (each dose accompanied by slow-motion filming and ominous sound effects), shows up late to more and more gigs, cheats on Puchi and flies into paranoid fits at the thought that she might be cheating on him. Missing, though, is any insight into his achievement as an artist. We hear it proclaimed that salsa was a revolutionary sound, a groundbreaking synthesis of Puerto Rico and New York, but the musical and historical information that would flesh out this assertion is missing. As with most movies of its kind —  a notable recent exception is “Ray” — “El Cantante” fails to enrich our understanding of the music that should be its main reason for being.  Still, the music itself can hardly be ruined, and the evident love for it shown by Ms. Lopez, Mr. Ichaso and Mr. Anthony make it possible to forgive their other lapses. It may be best to approach “El Cantante” less as a movie than as a two-hour promotional video for a must-have soundtrack album.  “El Cantante” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity, drug use and some violent and sexual situations.

For "El Cantante," someone left the salsa out on the counter too long. A virtual template of every imaginable cliche of the musical biopic, pic suffers from a lack of narrative and character focus, partly stemming from the need for producer-star Jennifer Lopez (whose shingle Nuyorican Prods. has nurtured the project) to have a co-leading part with substantial playing time alongside Marc Anthony, who portrays famed, drug-addled salsa star Hector Lavoe. While pic's assured a few good weeks based on J-Lo's fan base, this gig is headed South in short order.
Positioning of Leon Ichaso as helmer would seem to be a shrewd choice, given his finely wrought biopic "Pinero" and his previous "Hendrix." But script by Ichaso, David Darmstaedter and Todd Anthony Bello fails to explore in an interesting way what drove such a beloved recording artist as Lavoe (a huge star for Fania Records from the '60s through the mid-'80s) to self-destruct in a mountain of cocaine and heroin.
Worse, the central narrative device--Lopez as Puchi, Lavoe's loving but difficult wife, giving her side of the story for a "Behind the Music"-style film--is instantly phony and arch. For starters, Lopez doesn't look like the older woman she plays, even though her Puchi would actually be well into her 60s. To make matters dicier, Puchi couldn't have possibly been privy to some of the situations Hector is shown in, so the whole notion of the pic being her p.o.v. is dubious.
After an on-screen graphic noting that 1985 was Hector's last good year and a prelude when Puchi arrives like a bitch on wheels for the filming session, bio flashes back to Puerto Rico, 1963. Hector is a charming singer with his dad, but he knows that he has to immigrate to Gotham in order to grab the success he senses is his. Puchi is instantly attracted to him in a Bronx nightclub, and they're a couple well before the second reel.
Hector comes to the attention of Jerry Masucci (Federico Castelluccio), who's forming a stable of talent for his new Fania label. Matched with New York-based trumpeter Willie Colon (John Ortiz), Hector begins developing musical ideas to mix jazz (Willie's forte), merengue (Hector's passion), samba and other Latin styles into "a sauce" -- salsa.
Sadly, "El Cantante" barely addresses Hector and Willie's artistry, and never explores (as in, say, Clint Eastwood's Charlie Parker bio, "Bird") how performing artists moving into new territory develop and mature. Pic's perhaps unintended suggestion is that Hector arrived fully formed (hardly the case).
It's quickly apparent that Puchi -- who does little but watch Hector sing -- is a poor choice for narrator and that her character has been barely conceived on the page. Evidence of Puchi's comments that Hector was "funny and corny" almost never pops up, while her tendency to turn nastier and more spiteful as they grow wealthier and move to a Central Park townhouse makes her borderline repellant.
Huge chunk of pic's midsection, as well as final reels, are consumed with Hector fighting his worsening addiction. Puchi repeatedly chides him, but the fact that she also indulged in drugs in the '60s and '70s alongside Hector is not addressed.
There's less dramatic rise and fall in "El Cantante" than a dull, downward slide that only an artist with the power of a Scorsese could have turned into something fascinating to watch.
Story is interrupted from time to time with welcome views of Hector and Willie onstage, supported by a fabulous assembly of big-band players (totaling some 59, according to credits, along with over a dozen other credited players and dancers). Ichaso's direction appears to come alive during these musical respites in the grinding narrative, hinting at a very different movie that might have been.
Lopez conjures up plenty of ferocity and street attitude as Puchi, but there's no shape, or power, to the wrath. Similarly, Anthony seems ill at ease playing a rather passive guy who goes far with his talent but seems to lack an inner compass. He ends up being among the dullest of movie drug addicts.
Production package is geared for the bigscreen, but the fairly bland visual design will make pic more than suitable to be seen on the tube. Within pic's many standard-issue biopic montage sequences, a fun array of period concert posters and Fania album covers is sure to be appreciated by salsa lovers.

Director Leon Ichaso , already responsible for mucking up a made-for-TV Jimi Hendrix  biopic, is back at it with this turgid film about salsa star Hector Lavoe  (Marc Anthony ), which doesn't so much go behind the music as beneath it. Focusing almost solely on Lavoe's addictions (drugs and women, ho and hum), El Cantante is a garish, dispiriting bit of worka mountain of biopic clichés snorted through the lens of a fidgety camera that never pauses long enough for us to get to like (or even know) the man responsible for making the Nuyorican sound a mainstream American commodity in the 1970s and early '80s. Every so often, a character appears to tell us Lavoe's sound "will change everything ," but nothing happens after that; it's the same ol' self-pity party as Lavoewhose papa doesn't approve of his move from Puerto Rico to Americablames everyone but himself for his woes, despite his seemingly instant fame. Worse, Anthony's real-life wife, Jennifer Lopez , tries to make the film about her; miscast as Lavoe's missus, Puchi, Lopez hides behind aging makeup that makes her look like Bebe Neuwirth .
