 Tom DiCillo’s angry comedy “Delirious” subjects modern celebrity culture to a microscopic examination that shows the toxic virus of fame squirming and multiplying under its lens. Here are the paparazzi posted like ravenous vermin in front of a velvet rope, ready to trample one another in a stampede at the next celebrity sighting.  Here is the quintessential pop star of the moment, K’Harma Leeds (Alison Lohman), a shallow, talent-free Britney-Paris-Lindsay amalgam with the allure of a tarnished rhinestone in the dump that passes for a glamorous nightclub. K’Harma’s albums sell 10 million units, declares a publicist, a detail that suggests the screenplay was completed before the record industry’s precipitous decline. She has also lent her name to a new celebrity scent, Instant K’Harma.  Grimmest of all are the stars’ handlers, haggling by cellphone  in limousines as they approach a premiere at which two media flavors of the week have been programmed in a militarylike operation to arrive simultaneously and fall into a less-than-spontaneous kiss.  To remind the viewer that there is a satiric element in all this, Elvis Costello (playing himself and sounding amused) shows up at a party and announces that he and K’Harma are collaborating on a Broadway-bound musical about the life of Britney Spears. The movie visits a Soap Stars Against STD Convention, at which self-described “STD survivors” mouth icky platitudes. Sometimes, however, the satire goes seriously out of control, as in an impenetrable spoof of daytime drama.  “Delirious” is a crude pop allegory in which a holy innocent named Toby Grace (Michael Pitt) is willingly sucked into the maw of the beast. A homeless drifter and aspiring actor who has moved to New York from Philadelphia, he seems on the verge of starvation when he attaches himself as a volunteer gofer to Les Galantine (Steve Buscemi), a ratty paparazzo. With his buggy eyes and crooked teeth, Mr. Buscemi  (who also appeared in Mr. DiCillo’s 1995 film, “Living in Oblivion”) gives a courageously repulsive performance as a loudmouthed parasite who seriously brags about getting a shot of Goldie Hawn eating lunch.  Les is infinitely condescending and abusive to his meek new assistant, whom he allows to sleep in a storage cabinet in his shambles of an apartment, stuffed with photo equipment. But Toby, with his androgynous charisma, is fated to be a star. The first time he crosses K’Harma’s path, she notices him. By the end of the movie, they are sweethearts and he is a budding soap opera star. But Toby is ultimately as much of a cipher as K’Harma.  His ascent to the charmed circle, which Les is dying to enter, is inevitable and rapid. Spotted by Dana (Gina Gershon), a casting agent attending the soap-star benefit, Toby is pegged as “a natural.” In no time he metamorphoses from Dana’s client to her lover and then her ex-lover. Ms. Gershon’s magnetic, hard-shelled agent is too shrewd to let her wounded vanity interfere with business.  “Delirious” is the second film in recent weeks, following “Interview,” in which Mr. Buscemi  plays someone abrasively rubbing elbows with fame. There, he is a corrupt, downwardly mobile political journalist given a hack assignment to profile a starlet (Sienna Miller) to whom he feels so superior he doesn’t bother to prepare.  Les, who has fewer pretensions, is an unkempt, star-struck bottom feeder who shamelessly tries to worm his way into events where he can pilfer as many goodie bags as he can grab and convince himself that he is not his worst nightmare, “a peon.” His latest coup, circulated on the Internet, is a candid snapshot of a male star hobbling out of a plastic surgeon’s office following penile surgery.  The scenes of Les haranguing Toby with his grubby tales of triumph (a juicy picture can command $700, he boasts) recall Martin Scorsese’s still-underappreciated 1983 satire, “The King of Comedy,” in which Robert De Niro’s character, Rupert Pupkin, ascends by hook and by crook from predatory fan to big-time comedian. If Les lacks the psychotic chutzpah of Rupert, he harbors the deadly potential to become a Mark David Chapman.  Mr. DiCillo’s disgust with this voracious culture is palpable throughout a movie in which there is no glamour to be found. Even though he reserves a spoonful of honey to make this bitter medicine go down, you leave the movie feeling as though you have gazed into a closed circle of hell where everybody feeds off everyone else until there is nothing left.

A high-energy rags-to-riches satire about a deranged New York paparazzo and a wannabe thesp, "Delirious" is hilarious. Though none-too original in what it says about image and authenticity -- thematically it's not too far from helmer Tom DeCillo's "The Real Blonde" -- pic speaks with style, verve and genuine wit. An all-or-nothing perf from old DiCillo hand Steve Buscemi and a script that leaves no ironical stone unturned make this laugh-out-loud fare. Things flatten during the last half hour, but by then pic has earned its points. Sharp marketing could bring this accessible, smiling assault on the fame industry to auds beyond DeCillo's savvy followers. 
Pic, which took best director and best screenplay awards at the San Sebastian fest, kicks off with the punchy pop of the Dandy Warhols' "Bohemian Like You," which sets the mood for all the vigor and charm to come.
Good-looking homeless kid and wannabe actor Toby (Michael Pitt) stumbles across a gaggle of paparazzi, including Les Galantine (Buscemi), desperate to get a shot of pop star K'Harma Leed (Alison Lohman) as she's leaving a club. The proud highlights of Les' photog career are shots of Goldie Hawn having lunch and Elvis Costello without his hat.Toby inveigles his way into Les' chaotic apartment and before long, he's Les' unpaid assistant -- but not before he and K'Harma have swapped a meaningful glance.
An overheard conversation leads to an overnight stakeout by Les and Toby, and they get a photo of a singer recovering from a penis operation. Les is overjoyed at the $700 he makes.�
At a Soap Stars Against STD convention, Toby meets casting director Dana (Gina Gershon, terrific), then once again encounters K'harma, who was recently ditched by b.f. Jace (Brit thesp Richard Short). One thing leads to another, until Toby spends the night with K'harma in a hotel and finds himself on a ladder that will lead him into soap stardom.
Buscemi, in full-on human rat mode, delivers a manic comic perf as a self-deceived man who is secretly, and a little tragically, aware of his self-deception. Pitt as the blank Toby is a fine counterpoint, and most of the big laughs come from their exchanges.
Away from the boys, the script turns its sharp-eyed attention to the lifestyle of the talentless K'harma.
Pic's multiple riffs on the fame industry are nothing new, but thescript is so busy having fun and sending up the absurdities of contempo PR-speak that it doesn't push its obvious message. Still, DiCillo finds time to go a little deeper, as when Les bitterly reflects that "a friend is someone waiting for the chance to talk about himself."
Lensing, as befits the generally delirious air, is often furious hand-held, but occasionally things slow down to give a sense of the alleyways of the Gotham underbelly.
Music, mostly snatches of pop, is key to the overall effect. Worth listening to is clever "Take Your Love and Shove It." Pic's final scene -- a brief, telling coda -- runs after the end credits.

Agently attitudinous, generally zippy urban fairy tale about pop stars and the hangers-on who coddle (or prey upon) them, Tom DiCillo 's Delirious  is a mild Midnight Cowboy , a minor King of Comedy , and mainly a vehicle for Steve Buscemi  as a lower Manhattanbased paparazzo. Not entirely by accident, a dumb, sweet, homeless hunk (Michael Pitt ) becomes an unpaid intern for the irascible photographer (seedy even by Buscemi standards), then manages to connect with one of the celebrity-stalker's subjects, a Spearsoid mediocrity played by Alison Lohman . Pitt falls in love with the singer's image and is swept into a VIP world where the camera mediates every emotion, particularly once he is adopted by Gina Gershon 's predatory casting director. DiCillo has a feel for this milieuthe "Soap Stars Against STD" banquet and a scene in which two cell-wielding flacks negotiate their clients' impending rope-line reunion are minor classicsas well as an eye for downtown glamour. (His 1991 feature Johnny Suede   gave thenTV actor Brad Pitt  his first starring role; that film also established Catherine Keener 's screen persona.) As a director, DiCillo has an evident rapport with his actors. Lohman demonstrates a hitherto unexplored comic timing in the mock music video "Take Your Love and Shove It." But it's Buscemi who imbues the movie with a scabrous pathos that is scarcely mitigated by the final flash-bulb white-out. A former cinematographer, DiCillo has always made visually fastidious movies. Perhaps this is the case with Delirious , but I can't be suredemonstrating a brainless contempt for everyone concerned, the movie's PR firm chose to press-screen a cruddy digital transfer branded throughout with the frame-wide inscription "Property of Peace Arch Films."
