In his debut feature film, writer/director McDonagh (the acclaimed Irish playwright of The Beauty Queen of Leenane
 and others) seems to be telling us that life can be both as wretched and absurd as a Hieronymus Bosch painting (though I suspect Bosch would differ, having no distanced modern perspective on the solemnity and certainty of God's wrath). Two hitmen on vacation in the medieval Belgian town of Bruges have very different reactions to the Bosch painting they encounter there in this film that was the opening-night selection at last month's Sundance Film Festival. Ken (Gleeson) and Ray (Farrell) have been dispatched to Bruges by their boss, Harry (Fiennes), to lie low and wait for the heat to die down after they've botched a murder in London. The older Ken finds the ancient town calming and contemplative, while the younger and more antsy Ray regards it as a "shit hole." While waiting, like two figures out of Samuel Beckett for the phone call from Harry that's slow in coming, Ken is happy to sightsee and stroll about, but Ray needs something more to do to keep his mind off his guilt over the hit in London that went awry. A pretty girl who deals coke (Po�sy) and a racist dwarf (Prentice) are some of the new companions with whom he passes the time. In Bruges
 is at its best when it's just passing the time. The idle dialogue is often priceless and Gleeson (playing against type) is a delight to watch as his big beefy face switches from brutish to benign (though Farrell seems to be generally coasting). Gleeson and Farrell have a nice chemistry, and their opposite body types make them appear to be a comic duo before even opening their mouths. When the action kicks in, however, In Bruges
 starts to go off the rails. The film's light comedy and dark morality make for an unsettling mix, as when the gentility of the centuries-old cobblestone street is spattered with the blood of a thuggishly detached limb. Certain scenes cry out for a prudent editor who might have shaped the film's aimlessness into something more focused. This gives the entire film an uneven feel and makes the action of the last third seem more ridiculous than it really is. Maybe it's just that the cycle of hitman film escapades is played out for the time being, but In Bruges
 might have been better off using a silencer.


What's a pair of Irish hitmen doing "In Bruges"? I.e., what are two colorful but hackneyed movie stereotypes doing in Belgium's most well-preserved medieval city?
The same thing, more or less, that a respected Irish playwright like Martin McDonagh is doing playing with genre-movie conventions: slumming with style while learning the ropes.
The writer of such dark, highly praised nights at the theater as "The Beauty Queen of Leenane," "The Lieutenant of Inishmore," and "The Pillowman" has been ambitious about expanding his voice and career to include the medium of film. A half-hour apprentice work called "Six Shooter" starred Brendan Gleeson ("Troy") and had the kick of a good, cruel short story; it won a 2005 Oscar for best live-action short and you can buy it on iTunes.
"In Bruges," McDonagh's feature debut, stars Gleeson again, this time as Ken, one half of a Laurel-and-Hardy muscle team working for a short-fused London gangster named Harry (Ralph Fiennes). Ken's counterpart - Stan to his Ollie - is Ray (Colin Farrell), and the two have been dispatched to Bruges to hide out after a whack has gone awry.
Why Bruges? Ray continually asks Ken the same question in much less printable language, and a lot of the film's humor comes from this itchy yobbo's uncomprehending encounter with the beauty and gravity of a foreign place. He'd rather chase beauty and lack of gravity in a comely blonde named Chloe (Clémence Poésy), who has a few secrets of her own.
By contrast, the older and more circumspect Ken is smitten with the city: the steeples and canals, the mysterious Flemish masters whose works hang in museums, the slanting Vermeer sunlight. At one point the two gangsters stand before Hieronymus Bosch's triptych "The Last Judgment," and even Ray has to wonder at its murky power. The audience, meanwhile, is prompted to wonder which panel Bruges itself symbolizes for the men: heaven, hell, or - ding-ding-ding, we have a winner - purgatory.
McDonagh has other things to learn about moviemaking: burying the themes so characters don't keep tripping over them, downshifting smoothly, rather than yawing, between comedy and drama. He's still enough of a novice to toss in a surly dwarf (Jordan Prentice) - on horse tranquilizers, yet - while making fun of other movies' clichéd use of dwarves in dream sequences. Nor does he know yet how to end a film: "In Bruges" has more false peaks than Mount Jefferson.
Like any good playwright, though - particularly an Irish playwright - McDonagh reveres language and performance, as well as the way playacting can provide a defense against a malicious world. Gleeson does fine work here as a thoughtful man reconciled to a bloody business, and Farrell is both funny and touching while playing Ray as broadly as he can get away with. The part's nearly a cartoon, and the actor's black eyebrows seem like Kabuki slashes of disbelief; this film and "Cassandra's Dream" provide proof that Farrell may do fresher work opposite another actor than he does as a stand-alone lead.
Why are Ken and Ray in Bruges, anyway? The discomfiting answer arrives just ahead of their boss, played by Fiennes with sleek homicidal impatience. The star appears to be set on one-upping Ben Kingsley in "Sexy Beast," which is fine since "In Bruges" is starting to flag by this point, and Fiennes's energy gets the film over the finish line.
Not without hurdles: The final scenes include more Bosch symbolism, a trendy smattering of gore, a suicide-cam shot, and the too-tidy resolution of plot that marks a gifted and promising talent taking a new medium for a spin. God help us all when the training wheels come off.

Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson enjoy themselves mightily in the unpolished black tragicomedy In Bruges . And why shouldn't they? They play Irish hitmen on the lam in Belgium  and the very notion of such a placid tourist spot as a lam destination is engineered for maximum amusement, at least among European audiences who enjoy a good, dumb Belgian joke. Farrell is Ray, agitated with guilt about the innocent bystander he killed in the course of his first big rubout assignment in London  but not so morose that he doesn't have an eye for ladies of any nationality, nor so unmoved by beauty that he doesn't declare, ''Bruges is a s---hole.'' (Heads up, Mr. Moviefone, the place is pronounced Broozh .) Gleeson is Ken, the more seasoned goon, instructed by the pair's crime boss to keep a lid on Ray. As it happens, Ken is a tourist-aesthete with an eye for the historic Flemish city's handsome canals and medieval architecture.
The roles are big, broad, violent, and strategically funny  they'd be visible from a theater balcony, and not only when, at a pub, Ray mocks the less-than-tub-size volume of Ken's drink order as a ''gay beer.'' Director Martin McDonagh has clearly told his prize players to Go Big, and the pair didn't have to be told twice. Ray meets a pretty French girl (up-and-comer Clémence Poésy) who's a bit of a drug dealer but nice all the same, and Farrell cries, glowers, flirts, and milks his bad-boy charms for a lark. Ken admires religious relics with unironic enthusiasm before being handed a particularly nasty, deadly assignment, and Gleeson savors yet another chance to make the most of the contradictions between his menacing mass and his gentle eyes. Neither star is sloppy, but both are loose and mellow  a couple of pros who know they're the whole show.
In Bruges  is McDonagh's debut as a feature-length director. The filmmaker, who also wrote the original script, is best known as a playwright, lauded on Broadway and abroad for productions including The Pillowman, The Beauty Queen of Leenane , and The Lieutenant of Inishmore . He's a specialist in constructing satisfying, live-wire dramas of violence that crash up against despair, in upending his characters' miseries with moments of twisted humor, and in sustaining a writing voice that roars with a particularly Irish robustness of obscenity.
Still, McDonagh hasn't yet solved the construction of a feature film. The writer in him lets his characters declaim and banter too indulgently, and the theater guy in him positions his thespians as if envisioning stage-set changes, his eye not quite attuned to the cinematic requirements of movement through real space. (The film was shot on location.) And so In Bruges  lurches from pretty but uninformative tour-of-the-town footage to static conversations between Ray and Ken, dully framed. McDonagh has said he's inspired by Scorsese and Tarantino; he takes from his heroes a penchant for idiosyncratic cutaway shots, but not enough of the distinctive pacing skills to give those cutaways meaning.
The story is also a precariously busy affair, saddled with a film-within-a-film subplot: Cooling their heels in that pretty-slash-boring fairy-tale town, the fellas come across a nighttime shoot, where the sight of a dwarf American actor (Jordan Prentice) throws Ray into paroxysms of gawping, un-PC excitement. (As a comedy gift to European Union recipients, Ray also heartily insults three fat, braying American tourists planning to climb the narrow stairs of Bruges' famed 13th-century bell tower.) Later, that same dwarf (who bristles with very McDonagh-esque ire) will become baroquely embroiled in Ray's life; first he has to court an audience laugh by hiring a long, slinky Dutch hooker. Dutch , ha, another inside joke for the Europeans!
But just as this Odd Feckin' Couple runs out of Continental diversions, In Bruges  takes a turn for the (even) more extreme with the appearance of the boys' London boss, Harry. Or, to be exact, 'Arry . As played by Ralph Fiennes, the icy psychopathic SOB has one foot in the world of a Monty Python parody crime-world baddie and the other in the realm of Voldemort. Unsatisfied with the way some of his instructions have (or haven't) been carried out, Harry arrives in his flash business suit  with his bony death-head stare  to push In Bruges  to its amped-up last act. Blood spurts, hopes are thwarted, tragedy and pathos convene on the Belgian cobblestones, along with the dwarf. In McDonagh's theatrical neighborhood, it's business as usual.

 Not long after the start of “In Bruges,” an amusing trifle from the potty-mouthed playwright Martin McDonagh, two hit men pause before a painting, awe and puzzlement and perhaps something else shading their faces. The painting — a 15th-century Netherlandish diptych  — shows a prisoner wearing a loincloth and a strangely calm expression given that he’s being flayed alive. A small gathering of men (an audience, you might say) stands around the condemned, whose left calf is being peeled like a blood orange.  Mr. McDonagh has a thing for red. He splashes it around in his farcical play “The Lieutenant of Inishmore” and does much the same for “In Bruges,” his feature filmmaking debut. Neither work offers much beyond the comedy of words and wounds, though there is sting in both. In “Inishmore” an I.R.A. enforcer says: “Come on in ahead for yourselves. I’m just in the middle of shooting me Dad.” The lines are funny kind of, sort of, precisely because of the apparent diffidence with which the enforcer (or, rather, Mr. McDonagh) joins two seemingly dissonant themes, in this case politeness and patricide. The enforcer tortures men in the name of terror, but (oh, irony!) he loves his cat.  The film’s hit men — an Irish Laurel and Hardy act called Ray and Ken and played by Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson — have come to the Belgian tourist town of Bruges on puzzling orders from their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes). There, about an hour from Brussels and a greater psychological distance from their home in London, Ray and Ken wait and talk and wait and talk in a hotel room built for two. Ken reads books and coaxes Ray to enjoy the sights. Ray responds by scuffing his shoes on the ground like the child he’s meant to resemble, from his pretty pout to his comically expressive eyebrows, dark slashes that rise and fall and further accent the already heavily intonated dialogue. The camera drags along too.  Much of the pleasure of Mr. McDonagh’s dialogue comes from intonation and repetition. His characters tend to repeat their own and one another’s words, a device that forces you to heed both the musicality of the language and all that lies beneath those words — the oblique hopes, the implied fears, the unarticulated relationships. “We shall strike a balance between culture and fun,” says Ken,  while coercing Ray to go sightseeing. “Somehow, I believe, Ken,  the balance will tip in the favor of culture,” says Ray. Mr. Farrell’s voice rises up nearly to a falsetto on the word tip, which underscores the absurdity of the scene — two paid killers sightseeing in Bruges or anywhere — while adding an inescapable suggestion of menace.  Mr. Gleeson, Mr. Farrell and especially the late-arriving and welcome Mr. Fiennes have great fun rummaging around inside Mr. McDonagh’s modest bag of tricks. The three work well together, with Mr. Gleeson’s solid, stolid physicality and performance  giving ballast to Mr. Farrell’s lilting, fluttery turn. It’s easy for Mr. Farrell to turn on heat; what’s hard for him as an actor is turning the temperature off, or at least down, as he does here —  finding another way to connect to the material (and us) beyond the promise in his dark, fluttering lashes. His performance as Ray is as crudely conceived as it is finally sentimental (the same goes for the film), but it’s also winning because Mr. Farrell makes us see the goofy side of seduction.  “In Bruges” is itself a goof, both diverting and forgettable. Despite the guns, genre posturing and self-consciously naughty shocks (jokes about racist dwarfs and  fat Americans) it’s also unmistakably sincere. The writing sounds like the handiwork of a very clever young filmmaking student with a fondness for Sartre and Tarantino, though here the 30-something Mr. McDonagh only name-drops Nicolas Roeg and “Touch of Evil.” These are solid allusions, certainly, yet like that 15th-century painting of the unfortunate prisoner being flayed alive — which suggests that Mr. McDonagh means to say something about the spectacle of violence — they don’t add up to anything. He talks a blue streak beautifully, but he has yet to find the nuance and poetry that make his red images signify with commensurate sizzle and pop.  “In Bruges” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Dirty words, bloody wounds.

Martin McDonagh benches the bolder, brasher side of his dramatic writing skills and tries his hand at genre and plot in his highly erratic filmmaking debut, �In Bruges.� Closer to pics like �The Hit� and �Miller�s Crossing� than to McDonagh�s bristling, funny plays, this half-comic, half-serious account of two Irish hitmen who are sent to the titular Belgian burg to cool their heels after a job is moderately fair as a nutty character study, but overly far-fetched once the action kicks in. After pic�s Sundance opener spotlight, Focus should expect generally indifferent critical and aud response during February rollout.
McDonagh�s transition here brings to mind David Mamet (a strong influence on McDonagh�s stage work), who similarly switched from writing plays to writing and directing brainy thrillers for the screen like �House of Games,� �Heist� and �Spartan.� In both cases, men with exceptional gifts for theatrical language feel compelled to suppress many of their nerviest instincts in favor of weak plot-making.
When basically nothing is going on in the film and McDonagh�s guys are simply exploring the popular Belgium tourist spot, there�s at least some space for Brendan Gleeson and Colin Farrell as (respectively) vet hitman Ken and rookie Ray to bounce off each other, verbally and behaviorally. But the plot machinations expose McDonagh as a poor handler of even semi-logical action, draining the film of any real point once the gunfire and bloodletting end.
 In voiceover, Ray explains that the guys have been ordered by their boss Harry (Ralph Fiennes) to leave London and go to Bruges, and wait for his phone call. They obediently do, though Ray won�t stop bitching and moaning about Bruges as a �hellhole� and hardly up to the standards of hometown Dublin. Ken, on the other hand, soon enjoys drinking up the town�s preening quaintness and well-preserved medieval architecture.
Even in the early sections, where at least McDonagh can concentrate on his dialogue, there�s a strong sense that the film isn�t about much at all, and what�s there could blow away in a light breeze. Gleeson and Farrell rise above these problems, though, with a warm ease and an enjoyably natural way of depicting guys who like pissing each other off.
The reason the two were sent to Bruges is revealed in a stark flashback (featuring an uncredited Ciaran Hinds as an unfortunate priest) which triggers pic�s only affecting moments, as Ray contends with guilt over flubbing the London kill. 
Once Ray gets away from Ken and meets some locals like Chloe (Clemence Poesy), apparently working on a film shoot, and dwarf actor Jimmy (Jordan Prentice), things start to really go off the rails. McDonagh writes himself into corners he can�t get out of, such as a bizarre, cocaine-fueled scene in which Jimmy yammers on about an impending race war between whites and blacks. 
But just as the dramatic tension of �In Bruges� appears to rise, the film begins to lose any sense of itself, even as a supposedly affectionate tribute to crime movies (Orson Welles� �Touch of Evil� is glimpsed on TV).
Fiennes insinuates his way into the pic with a face that grows hard and a voice that means business; a verbally dazzling meeting with him and Gleeson in a cafe at night shows McDonagh at his profane best. But the action grows more ludicrous by the minute, and even the usually reliable and interesting composer Carter Burwell can�t effectively pump things up.
Fascinating angle here is the presence of fine Continental thesps, especially Jeremie Renier (�L�Enfant�) in an incongruous role as a young grifter and Gaul�s Poesy as a love interest with edges.
McDonagh shows no imagination or fire behind the camera, and his uses of Hieronymus Bosch paintings and figures seem like an obvious way of referencing Ray�s idea of hell. Bruges city boosters will be over the moon -- if not with Ray�s commentary, then with pic�s location choices. 


No celebrity hairdresser should ever be allowed near Colin Farrell 's eyebrows with a tweezer. Black, fluffy, and gloriously unilateral, they still aren't the prettiest things about In Bruges that honor falls to the Belgian city itself, known for its scenic medieval turrets, bourgeois tedium, and unfavorable comparisons with Amsterdam . Bruges may be the movie's rather too-long-running joke, but Farrell's shaggy brow is easily the most entertaining thing in Irish playwright Martin McDonagh 's first foray into the crime caper.
Flying about the actor's face like unhinged windshield wipers, knitting together in bovine puzzlement, lust, or sorrow for sins of commission past, this hyperactive hair tells you all you need to know about Ray, a minor hit man forcibly furloughed in Bruges with a much older colleague, Ken (Brendan Gleeson ). Their boss, Harryplayed by Ralph Fiennes  with an appetite that suggests he's enjoying his cockney break from the long-faced patrician depressives who have defined his careerhas dispatched them to Bruges, ostensibly to lie low after a botched job in London. While Ken pores over guidebooks and pants his way up medieval towers, Ray, a pub-crawling lug who dismisses history as "a load of stuff that's already happened," keeps breaking away to put the moves on Chloe (Clémence Poésy ), a Dutch nymph entrusted with furthering the movie's surrealist ambitions by supplying hard drugs on the film set that Ray and Ken keep mysteriously running intothe kind of film set that features angry dwarfs, fog machines, and copious allusions to the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch . Fellini, ahoy!
Anxious, perhaps, to reimburse us for Alexander , Farrell plays hapless to the hilt. But though he makes a charming counterpoint to Gleeson's clapped-out gangster, the two work way too hard at a worn tropethe temperamentally incompatible odd mob couple who, in the relentless logic of the male-buddy caper, are destined to become soulmates united by Catholic guilt for transgressions thoughtfully provided in colorful flashbacks. The ante is uppedthough truthfully not by muchwhen a phone call riddled with Mametian expletives from Harry reveals that the true purpose of their jolly holiday is for Ken to whack the bungling Ray. In this charged scenario, what could follow but the flowering of a beautiful father-son bond, interrupted at pace-quickening intervals by pistol fire and bantering exchanges with hookers, Russian gunrunners, and one very loquacious vertically challenged thespian?
Tolerably well-crafted, In Bruges  is also mighty pleased with itself, and not entirely without reason. McDonagh, whose 2003 play The Pillowman  was the toast of Broadway, cranks out gabby monologues by the ream, and the movie's modest charm lies mostly in the blarney that flies between these three mobsters as they posture, dicker, and digress over what's to happen nextand in all the blather about honor codes. But there's something glib and derivative about this clever chatter, and for all McDonagh's genuflections to Bosch, who never met an original sin he didn't want to commit to canvas, both the look and the moral agenda of In Bruges  suggest warmed-over Italian surrealism with a dash of early Scorsese.
All the proletarian poetry in the world can't save this movie from its blurry mess of mixed motives. Its pretensions to moral inquiry are muddled, even fraudulent, implying that it's OK to carry out a contract on a priest, but a chorister is a whole other ball of wax. The old-fashioned tenderness that warms Ray and Ken is continually undercut by rote reversions to blood and guts, heh-heh black comedy, and a knowingness that brings to mind Susan Sontag 's remark that when you push irony too far, all that remains is a breathless laugh. In the end, the movie succumbs to a self-defeating tonal clash between McDonagh the playwright, tipsy on wordplay and deep themes of sin, loyalty, and redemption, and the hipster novice filmmaker anxious to corner a lucrative movie market. In Bruges  may have won McDonagh the opening night at Sundance and a sweet deal with Focus Features , but six months from now, this very minor pleasure will have about as much traction as the misty city in which it's set.
