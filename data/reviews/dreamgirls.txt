         "Dreamgirls" is alive with the sound of music. It's a love song two times over, a tribute to a vibrant period of American popular music as well as to a style of filmmaking we don't get to see enough of: the big-budget Hollywood musical.
 
  Directed by Bill Condon, who also wrote the adaptation of the multiple Tony Award-winning play, "Dreamgirls" tells a familiar story with conviction and pizazz. It's a smartly entertaining example of updated traditionalism, of using modern energy and techniques to galvanize a story that was old-fashioned when director Michael Bennett dazzled Broadway with it in 1981.
 


         






    Based loosely on the career of Diana Ross and the Supremes, "Dreamgirls" is a classic backstage story, a look at the news behind the news of how a humble girl group called the Dreamettes made its way to the pinnacles of musical success and cultural influence. And — get out those handkerchiefs — of the emotional price that had to be paid along the way.
 
  This scenario wasn't exactly profound the first time around, but writer-director Condon so understands the emotional and technical demands of musicals (he was Oscar-nominated for the "Chicago" script) that he makes it feel fresh and alive. Plus he's added more context of the social upheaval of the 1960s and he's gotten terrific help, not only from his confident production team but also from the bottom half of his starring quartet.
 
  Although "Dreamgirls" is well-served by charismatic stars Jamie Foxx as pop music Svengali, Curtis Taylor Jr. and Beyoncé Knowles as Deena Jones, his beautiful Trilby, much of the film's appeal comes from the surprisingly compelling work of costars Eddie Murphy and Jennifer Hudson, neither of whom were inevitable for their roles.
 
  Murphy, who reportedly had to be talked into the part, gives the most fully rounded performance of his career as James "Thunder" Early, the Thunder Man himself, a soul singer of the James Brown/Jackie Wilson variety who gives the Dreamettes their first big break when he and his manager Marty (Danny Glover) hire them as his backup group.
 
  Using his matchless comic gifts and fox-in-the-henhouse charm, Murphy eats this part alive, making more than anyone else could of this creature of complete self-confidence and seduction. And when things become more serious and dramatic for his character in the second half, Murphy — helped by strong work by Anika Noni Rose as Dreamette Lorrell Robinson — is ready for that challenge as well.
 
  It wouldn't mean much to say that Dreamette Effie White is the role of Hudson's career because this is her film debut following time spent on "American Idol." You'd never know it though, because under Condon's direction she gives a fearless performance as the Dreamette who pays a price for having a mind of her own. And when she rips into the musical's Tom Eyen/Henry Krieger signature song, "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going," her singing tears the screen apart.
 
  Though not all the songs in the production, including four new tunes written for the film, are as strong and memorable as this one, "Dreamgirls" is unapologetic about front-and-centering its music. Because it is a story about singers who have to rehearse, perform and record, no opportunity is neglected for the kind of syncopated soul music and showmanship that characterized the Motown sound.
 
  "Dreamgirls" in fact begins in Detroit, with the Dreamettes showing up at a local theater to take part in a talent show. Besides getting a gig touring with the Thunder Man, they also acquire a manager in the form of Mr. Taylor, a Cadillac dealer who has designs on not only entering but also changing the music business, on getting "our music to a wider audience with our money."
 
  This is a strong vision, but as it plays out over the course of "Dreamgirls," it is complicated by the fact that Taylor turns out to be the scoundrel of the piece, someone who is willing to play romantic and career games with Hudson's Effie and Knowles' Deena if it helps to get that dream realized.
 
  Just as "Dreamgirls" needs someone of Knowles' allure and skill to make Deena creditable, it also needs Foxx's ability to project magnetism even when he is being pulled back and withholding. The film also couldn't exist without the zesty contributions of those responsible for its look: cinematographer Tobias Schliessler, production designer John Myhre, editor Virginia Katz, costume designer Sharen Davis, choreographer Fatima Robinson, and so on down the line. "Dreamgirls" is the entire musical package, a triumph of old school on-screen glamour, and we wouldn't want it any other way.

Dreamgirls  is the rare movie musical with real rapture in it. The opening cowbell clank could be a metronome to set your pulse to, and moments later, as we're plunked into amateur night at a Detroit theater in the pomade-and-sequin early '60s, where a group of funky chorines with gyrating booties are singing ''I'm Lookin' for Something,'' the effect is so ecstatic it just about lifts us off the ground. The jumpin'-jive editing isn't just music-video clutter; it works in beautiful smooth tandem with the whooshing, darting camera. The director, Bill Condon (Kinsey ), adapting the famously glittering Broadway musical that was first staged in 1981, hooks us into a mood of swirling, infectious freedom, and he doesn't let go. Dreamgirls , a candy-striped roman à clef, is, of course, a thinly veiled version of the rise of the Supremes and Berry Gordy's Motown. The slightly sinful jaunt of the music is the sound of a revolutionary new optimism  of a desire to break out and rise up, to set the world on fire with joy.
As a girl-group trio called the Dreamettes takes the stage, their lead vocalist, saucy, plush-figured Effie (Jennifer Hudson), sings the way that a lion roars, blasting the roof off with her full-throated gospel vibrations. She's as churchy and volcanic as the young Aretha Franklin, and as cleansing, too. Backstage, Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx), a snake-eyed hustler of astonishingly nimble charm, sweet-talks the group into letting him be their manager. He sets them up as backup singers for James ''Thunder'' Early (Eddie Murphy), a fading, salacious funk-blues belter who instantly teaches them a song, line by line, as the camera rotates into a concert performance; it's a thrilling, starstruck moment. Murphy, a-sizzle, plays this raspy James Brown showman by drawing on his lickety-split timing, but he also makes Early just a bit too quick on the draw, as if he were racing from the knowledge that his time was passing.
Stymied by the music industry's racism, Curtis pays off radio stations, a necessary evil captured in the furious, low-down ''Steppin' to the Bad Side.'' Then he spins the Dreamettes into a group of their own, which is when he makes his real deal with the devil: Though Effie is his paramour, he replaces her, as lead singer and in the bedroom, with the svelte, doll-featured, light-skinned backup singer Deena Jones (Beyoncé Knowles). It's not just a cosmetic change. As Curtis tells Effie, her voice is too ''special''  that is, too black. The resonance of the movie is the way it makes us see that Curtis, in his attempt to take on an industry that rips off black artists yet denies them access to the pop charts, has  to replace Effie. He's a scoundrel, but he makes the leap to a new sound, a new era, of elegant girl-group pop only by consigning his purest vocal talent to the trash heap.
Condon has staged Dreamgirls , or at least the electrifying first hour of it, as a single, flowing eruption of storytelling energy. As the Dreamettes become Deena Jones and the Dreams, the film's liquid jukebox-operetta style expresses the American crossover fantasy: the hunger to flood as vast an audience as possible with pure feeling. Yet even as the characters express themselves, thrillingly, through song, their personal entanglements  love affairs, descents into poverty and drug addiction  remain a tad abstract. In Dreamgirls , we're watching a tale of the evolution of black pop music in which black pop music is, in essence, the protagonist . When Effie, tossed out of the trio before a nightclub show, does her big number, ''And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,'' she's singing it to the two-timing Curtis, but it's really about the Dreams, with the gospel screamer going over the top into loss and desire, bidding goodbye to the musical fusion that no longer needs her.
Hudson's performance of this song is an epiphany, as grandly shattering a piece of musical acting as the movies have seen since Judy Garland wailed about ''The Man That Got Away'' in 1954's A Star Is Born . Yet having charted the triumph, and compromise, of black pop, Dreamgirls , in its second half, turns to the tale of what happens to all of these people  and since they're archetypes more than individuals, the drama is a bit hollow. It needed to be juicier, pulpier, more madly melodramatic. Curtis, high on success, becomes as controlling as the white power brokers he despised  he loses his soul to become the Man  yet why is Beyoncé's Deena such a saint? It's not as if Diana Ross, say, lacked a sense of power. The film's one true diva, Effie, falls into poverty and despair, but her saga never quite tears our hearts up. Dreamgirls  begins as a star-spangled dream of a musical, yet it ends up earthbound enough to be a very good movie rather than a great one.

 The dramatic and musical peak of “Dreamgirls” — the showstopper, the main reason to see the movie — comes around midpoint, when Jennifer Hudson, playing Effie White, sings “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going.” That song has been this musical’s calling card since the first Broadway production 25 years ago, but to see Ms. Hudson tear into it on screen nonetheless brings the goose-bumped thrill of witnessing something new, even historic. A former Disney cruise-ship entertainer with a physique to match her robust voice, Ms. Hudson was notoriously dismissed from “American Idol.” This sad instance of pop-cultural philistinism is echoed on the cover of the January 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, which omits her in favor of her better-known, thinner “Dreamgirls” co-stars Eddie Murphy, Jamie Foxx and Beyoncé Knowles.  Of course such slights are consistent with the character Ms. Hudson plays in Bill Condon’s film version of the show, originally written by Henry Krieger (music) and Tom Eyen (book and lyrics). Effie is, at first, the lead singer in a Detroit vocal trio called the Dreamettes (later the Dreams), and also the lover of Curtis Taylor Jr. (Mr. Foxx), the car salesman turned musical entrepreneur who serves as the group’s manager. She is replaced, both onstage and in Curtis’s affections, by Deena Jones (Ms. Knowles), her skinnier, lighter-skinned and more pliable sidekick, and relegated to poverty and obscurity while the group ascends into the pop firmament (and also leaves the crumbling Motor City for Los Angeles).  “And I Am Telling You,” for all the defiance of its lyric and the triumphal swell of its orchestration, is thus an anthem of impotence, a proud woman’s protest in the face of humiliation and defeat. Like it or not, Effie is going. She has no choice in the matter. But it’s not often you go to the movies and see a big-boned, sexually assertive, self-confident black woman — not played for laughs or impersonated by a male comedian in drag — holding the middle of the screen. And when was the last time you saw a first-time film actress upstage an Oscar winner, a pop diva and a movie star of long standing? Ms. Hudson is not going anywhere. She has arrived.  The vehicle that delivers her, however, does not always run smoothly. “Dreamgirls” is a souped-up, collectors’-edition replica of a model that Detroit — I mean Hollywood — used to turn out with ease and regularity. At the moment,  and maybe only for a moment, stage musicals seem to be in reasonably good health, with solid revivals and lively new shows filling Broadway theaters. At the multiplexes, however, it’s a grimmer story.  Periodic attempts to reinvigorate the form have a way of embalming it in nostalgia or tricking it out with frantic novelty. Or both. See “Moulin Rouge.” Audiences who go to “Dreamgirls” will have a good time, but they’ll be going for old time’s sake rather than to encounter anything vital or new.  And if “Dreamgirls” is disappointing, it is not for lack of effort by Mr. Condon or his cast, who do their best to combine the big, showy gestures of stage performance with the finer-grained demands of naturalistic screen acting. Like Mr. Condon’s other films — “Gods and Monsters,” “Kinsey” and “Chicago” (which he wrote but did not direct) — “Dreamgirls” takes place at the intersection of fame and desire, where sexual longing gets mixed up with hunger for public recognition.  No one in the movie expresses this tension better than Mr. Murphy, whose character, a soul singer named James (Thunder) Early, fights addiction, obsolescence and the demands of his own ego. Resorting frequently to the shorthand of montage, Mr. Condon for the most part succeeds in sustaining a narrative and emotional flow that links one song to the next.  But the problem with “Dreamgirls” — and it is not a small one — lies in those songs, which are not just musically and lyrically pedestrian, but historically and idiomatically disastrous. This is a musical, after all, about music, about an especially vibrant and mutable strain of rhythm and blues that proclaimed itself, boastfully but not inaccurately, to be “the sound of young America.”    Curtis is modeled — loosely enough to escape litigation — on Berry Gordy Jr., who turned Motown from a regional record label into a powerhouse. (The Dreams are a parallel-universe version of the Supremes.) The story of Curtis’s Rainbow Records is a familiar and potent tale of Faustian show-business ambition, as his climb to the top involves betraying and hurting the people closest to him. But without the right soundtrack, only half the story is being told. The performances are gratifyingly spirited, but what this movie most obviously lacks is soul.  The great Motown songwriters — Smokey Robinson, Marvin Gaye, the trio of geniuses known to posterity as Holland-Dozier-Holland — turned out great pop songs by the dozen, cutting bolts of blues, gospel and rock ’n’ roll into clean, trim, shiny garments. It is vain to imagine that Mr. Krieger and Mr. Eyen, who died in 1991, could replicate the Motown sound in all its variety, but as it is, the film barely acknowledges its existence.  As the cushioned blasts of overorchestrated thunder assaulted my ears, I would have given anything for a crisp horn chart, a clean drum line, a chattering rhythm guitar or even a memorably witty or catchy verse. Periodically, a character — Curtis, James or Effie’s songwriter brother C. C. (Keith Robinson) — will announce the arrival of a “new sound.” But even though the chronology and the costumes march from doo-wop to disco, everything in “Dreamgirls” sounds more or less the same, as the splashy imperatives of show-tune composing overwhelm everything in their path.  The music has the effect of compromising one of the crucial ambitions of the film: to refract the recent history of black America (and, by implication, America itself) through the prism of popular culture. Part of Curtis’s dream is to cross over and in the process permanently redefine the mainstream, and you hear a lot of talk about what kind of music will appeal to black or white ears.  You also see archival images (the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.; riots in Detroit) that register the aspirations and disappointments of America in the 1960s. But the music provides no guidance through the times, and as it tries to negotiate a period of profound change, it comes to rely on the talents of its production and costume designers, John Myhre and Sharen Davis, both of whom do brilliant work. The decades are marked by the progression of hairstyles, lapels, jewelry and dresses; after a while the experience starts to feel like a long, noisy guided tour through a museum.  Except of course that the dioramas occasionally spring to life when the singers transcend the limitations of the songs. This happens, most memorably, twice: when Ms. Hudson lays claim to “And I Am Telling You,” and when Ms. Knowles, late in the movie, lets loose in a recording booth on “Listen,” one of a handful of new songs written for the film.  Until that point her character, Deena, has been something of an enigma and, for Curtis, the passive vessel of his ambitions.   Ms. Knowles’s performance has been static and detached. In her limited work in movies she has never seemed comfortable with acting, shying away from any emotional display that might compromise her steely, hieratic dignity. But when she sings, she is capable of warmth, vulnerability, even ferocity, all of which she demonstrates in “Listen.” You cannot help but obey the imperative of the song’s title, even as you may wish the movie offered more that was worth listening to.  “Dreamgirls” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some sexual content, profanity and drug use.

Finally. After "The Phantom of the Opera," "Rent" and "The Producers" botched the transfer from stage to screen, "Dreamgirls" gets it right. Bill Condon's adaptation of the 1981 show about a Motown trio's climb to crossover stardom pulls off the fundamental double-act those three musical pics all missed: It stays true to the source material while standing on its own as a fully reimagined movie. Driven by tremendously exciting musical performances, the Par/DreamWorks release should sing loud and strong through awards season and beyond.
While it lost best musical in 1982 to "Nine," the original Broadway production of "Dreamgirls" won six Tonys, ran for 1,521 perfs and returned director-choreographer Michael Bennett to the spotlight five years after "A Chorus Line." Fittingly, Condon has dedicated the film to Bennett (who died of AIDS complications in 1987) and has echoed his original staging in savvy ways.
As he showed in his "Chicago" screenplay, Condon's love of the movie musical is backed by an awareness of how tricky it is to make the genre work for film audiences no longer accustomed to characters spontaneously bursting into song.
In "Chicago," the numbers evolved out of the characters' fantasies. Here, the first few songs are performances anchored in narrative context. Condon reels the audience in before gradually embracing traditional musical presentation -- first with brief, music-vid-style inserts during a montage and then with full-blown sung dialogue exchanges as the emotional stakes are raised. The mix not only blends seamlessly, it provides footing in the twin camps of movie musical and performance-based music biopic.
From the electric opening moments, the film establishes a highly energized, dynamic visual style. The dark screen is broken by quick flashes of color showing heels, skirts, hair and sashaying bodies at a 1962 Detroit talent contest.
Backstage, the Dreamettes -- Effie (Jennifer Hudson), Deena (Beyonce Knowles) and Lorell (Anika Noni Rose) -- prepare to go on. Curtis Taylor Jr. (Jamie Foxx), an upstart wheeler-dealer, notices the girls and lands them a job singing backup for established star James Thunder Early (Eddie Murphy). Condon deftly weaves this chunk of character introduction and exposition around the Dreamettes' sizzling performance of "Move."
Expanding on the basic template of writer-lyricist Tom Eyen's original book for the show, the script places the struggle of black performers against a background of racism, inequality and civil unrest. Adopting conventions of the classic showbiz pic without cliche, it examines the casualties and compromises of fame. The story's principal focus, however, is family, tracing bonds of shared experience that are cemented, broken and healed.
Cadillac salesman Curtis aims to secure his own fame as a music producer by moving beyond R&B to conquer the pop charts. Elbowing Jimmy's veteran manager Marty (Danny Glover) aside, Curtis books the singer into an upscale Miami club. Flamboyant Jimmy's sexualized style scares the ultra-white crooner crowd but Curtis perceives a marketable commodity in the Dreamettes.
He makes them over as headliners, renaming them the Dreams. Going for a smoother look and sound, Curtis demotes zaftig Effie to backup, despite general acknowledgment she has the strongest pipes, and makes slimmer, more telegenic Deena the lead. This sets in motion the film's central conflict and its most powerful emotional sparks.
Sidelined as lead singer and as Curtis' lover, Effie grows increasingly resentful and temperamental, prompting her replacement in the group. Sung by Curtis, the three original Dreams, Effie's songwriter brother C.C. (Keith Robinson) and replacement Michelle (Sharon Leal), the resulting confrontation, "It's All Over," is a dynamite sequence. Presented much as it was on stage, the complex number is cogent, dramatic and entirely unselfconscious in its pop-operatic language.
The emotional intensity is immediately pushed several notches higher with Hudson's raw, devastating delivery of "And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going." The anthem of proud desperation is forever linked to Jennifer Holliday's defining original interpretation but Hudson makes it her own, singing it on a bare stage backed by mirrors in an explicit nod to Bennett.
An "American Idol" finalist without prior screen experience, Hudson comes fully-formed to film. It's the kind of galvanizing perf that calls to mind debuts like Barbra Streisand in "Funny Girl" or Bette Midler in "The Rose," with a voice like the young Aretha. More fully developed here than onstage, Effie is the fierce, wounded, pulsating heart of the movie. Her big song and second explosive number "I Am Changing" both elicit audience cheers and applause.
Eyen's story was loosely based on the Supremes. Diana Ross took over lead spot from original frontwoman Florence Ballard, who unlike Effie, died in poverty at age 32. The Diana-Deena parallel is even more evident here, with Knowles' fashions, hairstyles and even sound mirroring various phases of Ross' career.
Despite the further parallel of Beyonce's emergence as the superstar soloist of Destiny's Child, Deena does not monopolize the film. Chief concession to spreading the spotlight is Deena's new powerhouse ballad, "Listen."
After some non-starter film roles, Knowles has been superbly utilized here by Condon. As befits a character described at one point as "a product," Deena is more manipulated than self-driven, but Knowles is poised, quietly determined and beautiful beyond belief, blossoming from innocent teenager to self-possessed star.
Playing a ruthless shark with shades of Berry Gordy Jr. and Ike Turner, Foxx seems to be holding back. His natural charisma is dimmed beneath Curtis' cool slickness and he looks uncomfortable in musical numbers.
Murphy, however, is a revelation. Mixing up James Brown, Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Jackie Wilson and some of his own wiseass persona, his Jimmy leaps off the screen both in his scorching numbers (his proto-rap is a killer) and dialogue scenes. It's his best screen work.
The character has been given a markedly different arc here, taking Murphy from hilarious and sexy to soulful and broken. Jimmy gets another of the film's strong new compositions in the social protest song "Patience." Murphy's dead-eyed stare and subsequent reaction after Curtis nixes the release is among the film's most piercing moments.
There's fine supporting work from Glover, Robinson and especially Rose, a bewitching stage performer ("Caroline, or Change") who shows equal assurance on film and terrific comic instincts.
While her role has been downsized, the only significant loss is Lorell's angry "Ain't No Party" rant, one of composer Henry Krieger's better songs. Loretta Devine, the original Broadway Lorell, also makes an appearance singing "I Miss You Old Friend."
There are some narrative ellipses that were unclear in the stage show and remain so -- Curtis' mob connections and legal hot water are dealt with too perfunctorily -- and Condon makes an odd choice in cutting mid-conversation to Deena and Effie's reconciliation after years of bitter silence. Not sharing their encounter from the start undersells a key emotional moment. But the storytelling overall is smooth and confident.
It was a brilliant stroke to have Broadway vets Jules Fisher and Peggy Eisenhauer light the performance scenes, the dazzling execution enhanced by Tobias A. Schliessler's swooping, circling camera. In the title number in particular, in which the trio members emerge as restyled stars, the widescreen camerawork is luscious, picking up an elbow-length glove, a fishtail skirt, an elegant choreographic move. And the trend toward machine-gun editing is refreshingly resisted by Virginia Katz, who creates a rhythm both kinetic and graceful.
The film drips glamour and vibrant color thanks to Sharen Davis' glitzy costumes and John Myhre's detailed production design. Matching Condon's achievement in marrying naturalistic showbiz drama with old-fashioned musical, the retro stylings of both sets and costumes expertly brush period-specific reality with subtle touches of fantasy.

It is said that a great actor or actress can "bring down the house," but before I saw (and heard) the 25-year-old American Idol finalist Jennifer Hudson in the film version of the 1981 Broadway musical Dreamgirls , I can't recall the last time I truly feared for the architectural stability of a movie theater. When Hudson, who is making her film debut, sings the end-of-first-act showstopper "And I Am Telling You I Am Not Going," it's as if some spiritual force has taken hold of her entire being: Her body trembles with each passing note, her wide brown eyes seem to speak the lyrics before they arrive at her lips, and the voice that erupts out of her hardly sounds humanit's the kind of thunderous, soul-stirring bellow that a wronged goddess might make upon learning that she had been betrayed for a mere mortal. And so she has. At that moment in the film, Hudson, who plays one member of a 1960s all-girl r&b trio called the Dreams, is confronting her manager/ex-lover (Jamie Foxx ) over his decision to oust her from the group in favor of a less gifted, less temperamental, and less full-figured replacement. But really, she's singing about her need to be lovednot just by anyone, but by the very man who has callously betrayed her. And so acute is her agony that mere words aren't enough to express it. Like all of the most joyous and tragic moments in movie musicals, it can only be sung.
With a star turn like that at its center, a movie doesn't need too much more, but Dreamgirls has plenty to go around. Its sense of showmanship is overflowing, from the opening talent-contest revue in which Detroit teenagers Deena (Beyoncé Knowles ), Lorrell (Anika Noni Rose ), and Effie (Hudson) are picked to sing backup for the glitter-outfitted James "Thunder" Early (Eddie Murphy , cannily cast as a onetime legend whose best moves have been stolen by younger performers), through to their farewell concert as the Dreams a decade later. The director, Bill Condon , who also adapted Dreamgirls for the screen, has the disposition of a vaudeville entertainerhe wants to give you your money's worth and then some.
Most, I suspect, will not go home unhappy. Arriving in a renaissance period for the big-budget Hollywood  musical, Dreamgirls is by far the best of a crop that includes the Oscar-winning Chicago , which Condon himself penned. Among that picture's many failings, it seemed vaguely embarrassed to even be a musical in the first place, relegating its production numbers to fantasy sequences set inside its characters' heads and otherwise making sure to give the audience fair warning: "OK. Don't be frightened. We're going to sing now." Dreamgirls , despite being similarly set in a theatrical milieu, feels no such compunction. Its characters don't just sing directly to one another, in the real world, but when they do, what they're singing about actually moves the story forward.
So it pains me to say that, on some crucial level, Dreamgirls falls short of expectations. Largely, the source material is at fault: Written by Tom Eyen  (with music by Henry Krieger ) and staged by the legendary director-choreographer Michael Bennett , the Broadway version of Dreamgirls drew much attention for its thinly-veiled fictionalization of Berry Gordy Jr. 's Motown Records  and the behind-the-scenes drama of Gordy's girl-group phenom the Supremes. But by now, so much of Dreamgirls ' real estate has been overdeveloped by the rash of Broadway and big-screen music biographies (Ray , Walk the Line , Jersey Boys ) that it's tough to get too worked up over yet more scenes of naive young vocalists hearing their song on the radio for the first time, encountering the ugly face of racism, and discovering that fame isn't all it's cracked up to be. And as both play and film, Dreamgirls takes a kid-gloves approach to its most intriguing subject: the way that black music moguls like Gordy systematically watered down grinding soul rhythms with vanilla pop melodies in the name of "crossing over" black artists to the pop charts.
It's only logical, then, that Dreamgirls should prove more absorbing in its second half, when Effie comes to dominate the story and when the movie itself becomes less about the path to stardom and more about what happens after you've made it (or haven't). That's also when Condon, who occasionally seems overwhelmed by the sheer bigness of the production, stops trying to wow us with one high-energy production number after another and recaptures in a few key scenes the exquisite intimacy of his two nonmusical biopics, Kinsey and Gods and Monsters . It's then that Condon grasps what has eluded most of his contemporaries: Anyone can give us the old razzle-dazzle, but what makes a movie musical soar is nothing more or less than the quiet exhilaration of two individuals on the screen, enraptured by song.
