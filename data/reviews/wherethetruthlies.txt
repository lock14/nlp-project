         In "Where the Truth Lies," the 10th feature film by prolific Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan, Colin Firth and Kevin Bacon play Vince Collins and Lanny Morris, a comedy song-and-dance team with a striking resemblance to Martin and Lewis, except one is British and the other not as weird.
 
  Shuttling between the 1950s, when the act was at its apex, and the 1970s, after the formerly inseparable duo has mysteriously parted company, the film follows the efforts of an ambitious young journalist, Karen O'Connor (Alison Lohman), to uncover the truth behind their bust-up. Karen has a personal as well as a professional stake in the story of Lanny and Vince, as she happened to appear on one of their popular polio telethons as a child, moving Lanny to tears. Lanny, as it happens, had other things to cry about that day, and eventually Karen learns a little something about worshiping false idols — not that she's the model of probity herself.
 


         






    There, in a gorgeously shot and designed (by Paul Sarossy and Phillip Barker, respectively) nutshell, is the thrust of the story: In Hollywood, things are not always as they seem. Believe it, baby.
 
  As if this weren't enough to cope with all at once, the film also advances the notion that journalists can be a sneaky, underhanded bunch capable of doing anything for a story. That goes double for sexy young journalists in backless pantsuits and disco eye shadow, especially when they're given large advances by major publishing companies and told to go out and bring home the dirt.
 
  So Karen meets with Vince in a smoky Hollywood bar to persuade him to collaborate — as in cough up the scoop on exactly what happened to the beautiful girl who turned up dead in their hotel room lo those many years ago.
 
  Sex, drugs, intrigue, murder, extortion, betrayal — it's all in there, every which way. Actually, mostly back and forth. As its convertible title suggests, "Where the Truth Lies" is big on the Manichean dualism in everything. Straight man and comic, interviewer and subject, ingénue and jaded cynic, star and servile nobody — each is as neatly reversible as a J. Crew windbreaker, if you just know where to tug.
 
  On her way back to New York after her tête-à-tête with Vince, Karen happens to land in the first-class seat next to Lanny's. Lanny, meanwhile, has no idea that she and the journalist he's recently authorized his lawyer to show portions of his memoir-in-progress to, to try to dissuade her from proceeding with her own project, are one and the same nubile youngster.
 
  The movie calls to mind some of Egoyan's earlier work, before he made films like "The Sweet Hereafter," in that axes are ground into fine points. Firth and Bacon bring enough talent and experience to their not very realistic characters to breathe some life into them, but poor Lohman, who is lovely, is stuck playing a symbol in fabulous outfits.
 
  To give much more away would spoil the movie's simple if serviceable twists, which keep the mystery humming along at a decent clip.
 
  But the real reason to see it is its style, which sets an otherwise fairly unremarkable whodunit in a seedy, lite-Lynchian wonderland that's enjoyable to hang out in for a while.
 
  The dialogue too is riddled with silly-noir pleasures, as when Karen's publisher tells her editor, "We've leased an oil well called Vince Collins and granted Ms. O'Connor the right to tap. I think we have a responsibility to monitor the drilling." Now that's the kind of mythic, silver-tongued glamour that attracts a girl to publishing.
 
  Too bad nothing is as it seems.

As twisty and sophisticated as they were, a lot of the old film noirs had a barely disguised salacious undertow. The women (Lana, Rita, Barbara) were high priestesses of nasty pleasure, and the films coasted, in essence, on our desire to see their carnality laid bare. Where the Truth Lies , Atom Egoyan's sexy, tantalizing, and befuddling noir murder mystery, works in a similar fashion. Cutting between two very different eras and moods, the jaunty submerged darkness of 1957 and the sunlit jadedness of 1972, Egoyan, adapting a novel by Rupert Holmes, unwraps the tale of a team of comedy legends, Lanny Morris (Kevin Bacon) and Vince Collins (Colin Firth), who are clearly meant to be a fictionalized takeoff on Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. In the '50s, the two are riding high, and Egoyan stages their nightclub and telethon appearances, as well as their after-hours hanky-panky in the company of groupies and mobsters, with a juicy inside-showbiz knowingness. But then the body of a woman, apparently drowned, is discovered in their hotel bathtub, and though neither man is charged with a crime, their career crashes to a halt.
Cut to the early '70s, when Karen O'Connor (Alison Lohman), an aspiring journalist, pursues each of them to uncover the heart of their hidden scandal. She's far from objective: As a girl, she appeared on their polio telethon, and her relationship to both men, especially Kevin Bacon's rakish Lanny, is that of a former Lolita ardently pursuing her spiritual Humbert. Lohman, who has peachy skin and the loveliest of overbites, acts with the breathy enthusiasm of a very cagey starlet, and the fact that it's genuinely hard to tell whether she's a slightly amateurish ingenue or a good actress playing innocent is intrinsic to the movie's appeal.
For much of Where the Truth Lies , the prospect of Karen's defilement lingers, and Egoyan, who has made the destructive attraction of older men to younger girls the driving obsession of his work, knows  how to exploit our voyeurism. A mood of lush romantic decadence  sleaze made enigmatic  hovers over Where the Truth Lies , which has a score that works so hard to evoke Vertigo that it may leave you dizzy. I swooned, at times, though I would have done so more freely if Egoyan the mad academic formalist, tinkering with structure and ''unreliable narrators,'' didn't have a way of tripping up his own spell.
The movie's voyeurism carries over to the '50s scenes, which, if anything, are even more lubricious. Lanny and Vince's dance of ego and intimacy is at the heart of Where the Truth Lies . Bacon plays Lanny with a rotting wolfish charm, and he and Firth, with his flips of politeness and rage, make the film's big secret feel right. That the crucial revelation scene got the film threatened with the taint of NC-17 (it's now unrated) only proves that sin truly is in the eye of the beholder.

 Plumbing the secrets of celebrity, its furtive ups and dirtiest downs, has been a favorite human endeavor for so long (psst, I hear Alexander swings both ways), it's a wonder that anyone can work up indignation about it, much less an interesting story line. We dish the dirt partly because it's a social lubricant but mostly because it's pleasurable, a quality largely absent from Atom Egoyan's period drama about a fictional comedy team, Collins and Morris, who conquered America, in particular anything in and out of a skirt, and popped more pills than Judy and Marilyn combined.  Set principally in the 1970's, with an occasional flashback to the 1950's, "Where the Truth Lies"  takes the shape of a  mystery, or rather one of those self-atomizing mysteries that play with genre. Mr. Egoyan, who has had his own ups ("The Sweet Hereafter") and downs ("Felicia's Journey"), tends to stray from the storytelling straight and narrow, taking a generally metafictional approach to narrative. Here, he seems to want to deconstruct celebrity through the familiar mechanics of a murder mystery. Yet because he also doesn't want to be imprisoned by genre, he tries to shake loose its rules, much as Robert Altman did in 1973 with his laid-back take on Raymond Chandler's "Long Goodbye." It almost works, at least in part.  When we first see Lanny Morris (Kevin Bacon) and Vince Collins (Colin Firth) waiting in the wings and staring at each other across a television stage, they look to be the bitterest of enemies and the closest of friends; in truth, they're both. The two are about to enter laughing and clowning for one of their annual polio telethons during which, through songs, patter and ingratiation, they will wring donations from the viewing audience. Whether mugging on the big screen or the little, plying their shtick in the Palisades or Miami, the pair are as seemingly inseparable as the team upon which they are loosely patterned, Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin, who together cut a lucrative swath through nightclubs, television and the movies in the late 1940's and early 1950's.  The film is based on the first novel by Rupert Holmes, who in 1986 won Tony Awards for  the score and the book of his first Broadway musical, "The Mystery of Edwin Drood," and earned earlier success for his vilely catchy pop song "Escape" ("If you like piña coladas ..."). In a review of Mr. Holmes's cabaret show in The New York Times, Stephen Holden noted that the songwriter was fond of "songs that present teasing little puzzles and games" and showing "how systems designed to facilitate communication between people can play tricks on them." Both approaches are at work in this novel, a puzzle of a story about the games played by a pair of faded entertainers and the hungry young journalist mucking about in their midst.  As far as I know, Martin and Lewis, as they were headlined in their heyday, never discovered a dead blonde sprawled in one of their bathtubs when they played the Latin Casino, the 500 Club or any of the other nightspots in which they polished their act and built their renown. In Mr. Holmes's very busy novel, which Mr. Egoyan has vainly attempted to wrestle into a coherent screenplay, Vince  and Lanny, along with some shady club types and a conveniently placed law enforcement officer, do find a blonde (a very good Rachel Blanchard) submerged unclothed in a tub. How that blonde ended up in such compromising circumstances is the central why in this whodunit, which is narrated in the main by another comely young blonde, Karen O'Connor (Alison Lohman).  As the hub of the story, Ms. Lohman guides us through what, at least on screen, evolves into an almost comically distorted labyrinth. Hired to pen a book about Vince, Karen, an ambitious reporter from the 1970's cut closer along the lines of Jessica Savitch than Oriana Fallaci, meets first one member of the long-disbanded comedy team, then the other. Slowly, through documents, interviews and one trippy  tumble down the rabbit hole in the company of yet a third blonde (Kristin Adams), Karen unlocks the secrets of Lanny  and Vince's collaboration. However tortuously engineered, these forays into the men's wonderland past succeed nicely because they usher the story back to that moment when the two worked their mojo in front of their most devoted audience: each other.  There is another big why swirling through this mystery, namely the calamitous miscasting of Ms. Lohman - as in why Mr. Egoyan chose to hang a story of sex and scandal on an actress whose ingénue looks and uncontrolled voice are wildly out of sync with the film's other performances and self-consciously lurid atmosphere. Ms. Lohman has done fine work in films like "White Oleander," but she has neither the chops nor the core mystery that might have made Mr. Egoyan's pseudo-David Lynch ambitions for his film fly. When Mr. Lynch unleashes the actress Naomi Watts in "Mulholland Drive," a film that surely was running through Mr. Egoyan's head when he directed this one, you see the allure of beauty as well as its dangers, not just a pretty face.  In the end, it is Mr. Egoyan's fealty to the novel, its feints and dodges, that proves the film's undoing. This becomes clear every time Lanny, a string bean soaked in hair grease and flop sweat, and Vince, a smooth operator and possible psychopath, turn their sights on each other. Mr. Bacon's excellent performance doesn't convey Jerry Lewis's manic neediness or genius for slapstick; even at Lanny's most aggressive and desperate, when he all but licks a television camera lens grubbing for attention, the imitation pales. Even so, the actors make a persuasive case for how love sometimes feeds a deep hate. Too bad their director, distracted by all that plot and his own narrative ambitions, couldn't see that two kings trump three blondes, dead or alive, every time.

"Where the Truth Lies" is an unconvincing film a clef
 about the sordid truth behind the breakup of a celebrated Hollywood performing team. Atom Egoyan's most mainstream and genre-oriented picture in his 20-year career applies a thick noir lacquer to a jumbled, time-jumping tale of a young female journalist prying the facts out of the aging entertainers and their cronies. Lacking strong critical backing, this ungainly picture faces a dicey commercial future.
Principally by changing the straight man in the act to a Brit, Egoyan has tried to reduce the similarities between the film, TV and nightclub stars here and a certain Italian-American crooner and his madcap Jewish partner that served as the obvious inspirations for Rupert Holmes' 2004 novel.
Be that as it may, it's the allure of seeing the curtain lifted on the "real" inside story of a famous act that gives pic its initial interest. Ironically, the ultimate revelation of the denouement is actually more plausible than the way in which most of what comes before is presented.
On perhaps the most fundamental level, longtime arthouse fave Egoyan lacks the sort of innate pizzazz to sock over a sense of '50s showbiz at its slickly entertaining apex. The audience is asked to accept the talent and popularity of the outrageous Lanny Morris (Kevin Bacon) and his more elegant partner Vince Collins (Colin Firth) by inference, as there's only a half-hearted attempt to fully recreate the ambiance and impact of a club act of the era (something quite skillfully pulled off by Kevin Spacey in "Beyond the Sea," for all the criticism it received).
Propelling the narrative is the intent of author Karen O'Connor (Alison Lohman) to finally deliver the unknown reason why Lanny and Vince abruptly split up at the height of their careers 15 years before. Rupture dates to the day when the naked body of a beautiful young woman was found in the bathtub of the entertainers' hotel suite, although the death was attributed to an overdose and no culpability was ever attached to the showmen.
Brief snippets of the pair's heyday reveals Vince to possess a scary violent side (he beats an audience member senseless over an anti-Semitic remark) and Lanny to be a full-time leech for whom efficient valet Reuben (David Hayman) procures girls from audiences, not to mention hot and cold-running room service cuties.
As Lanny later confesses to Karen in one of the script's better lines, "Having to be a nice guy is the toughest thing in the world if you're not."
Skipping back and forth through time in a manner more strenuous than edifying, pic attempts to assemble an intriguing portrait of intrepid reporter Karen, but while her relationship with her subjects begins by seeming complex, it ends up as murky, harsh and unsympathetic. A lifelong fan for reasons that are partly personal, Karen brandishes her million-dollar book contract like a search warrant, as if it entitled her free access to every last shred of personal history, although Vince has a financial motive as well.
After an amusing scene that makes excellent use of an archaic first class seating arrangement on Pan Am to facilitate a meeting between the two, Karen allows herself to be seduced by Lanny, only to be quickly spurned. But even more unsavory -- sexually and otherwise -- is her relationship with the testy Vince, who by 1972 has withdrawn to a glass Hollywood Hills home, where he envelopes Karen with his depraved mindset while she confrontationally attempts to land biographical pay dirt.
Fractured narrative devices are further encumbered by multiple narration sources, incidental characters who function as mere devices and uncertain time frames.
More bothersome still is the stiff, on-topic nature of most of the film; with Karen in full interrogation mode nearly all the time, scenes and characters are rarely allowed to breathe and develop of their own accord. Since Karen, for related reasons, never shows real vulnerability or humanity, she comes off as unnatural hard and pushy, a problem unrelieved by Lohman's performance, which reveals nothing beneath the surface or between the lines.
Bacon and Firth both prove more than adept at conveying their characters' seamy sides, which at least lends weight to the distasteful revelations in which the story is rooted, and are reasonably effective overall in cutting the desired profiles of glib entertainers taking full advantage of fame's perks.
Supporting turns tend toward overdrawn caricatures, although David Hayman, when not forced to erupt into overt explanations late-on, makes for a creepy presence as Lanny's all-purpose fixer.
Period detail is uneven -- strangely, more so in the '70s material than in the '50s -- and production design doesn't always feel like the real thing. Paul Sarossy's soft, sometimes dreamy lensing clashes with composer Mychael Danna's exhaustive efforts to replicate the sound of hardboiled Hollywood melodramas.

So why did those guys, the smooth singer and the crazy nutnot Dean Martin  and Jerry Lewis  but "Vince Collins " and "Lanny Morris "break up their fabulously successful act? And what did that have to do with the lovely young corpse planted by the New Jersey mob or maybe the ghost of Fatty Arbuckle  in their hotel suite bathtub on the eve of the team's ultimate telethon?
Atom Egoyan  excavates the alternate history of our times in this tawdry yet stilted historical noir, adapted from Rupert Holmes 's giddy 2003 crime novel and opening, in a press agent's dream of cosmic coincidence, only days before the pub date of Jerry Lewis's tell-some memoir Dean & Me (A Love Story) . Set in the early '70s, on the eve of Watergate (when, as we now know, every aspect of American life was hopelessly crass and ruled by conspiracy), the movie triangulates estranged Collins and Morris with an ambitious young celebrity journalist (Alison Lohman ). Some 15 years after the scandal and the guys' subsequent divorce, she's interviewing Vince (Colin Firth ) for a tell-all memoir.
Not that the name Richard Nixon  is ever uttered. Flashbacks to Collins and Morris's nightclub and bedroom antics"we were gods," one of them musesare complicated by the revelation that the young Ms. O'Connor (also played, in a surreal touch, by Lohman) was actually at the fateful telethon, as well as by the manuscript she receives unsolicited from Lanny (Kevin Bacon ) or his minions in an attempt to sugar her off the case. Things get even weirder when the high-flying journalist meets the divine Lanny 40,000 feet in the air en route from Los Angeles to New York.
As its title suggests, Where the Truth Lies  is a movie of multiple voices. Lush if not entirely coherent, this showbiz Rashomon  has continuity, as well as credibility, problems. The scenario keeps returning to Lanny's consciousness and pondering the nature of his personality. Game but not especially funny, Bacon is more effective as the cold, hostile "real" Lanny than as his manic, camera-kissing onstage persona; Firth drifts through the less demanding role of Vince, a sour cross between Dino and Rat Pack secondario  Peter Lawford . Lohman is the least likelyand hence most Egoyan-esqueof the corn-fed blonde vixens who proliferate throughout.
A series of nearly inexplicable plot developments leaves the baby-faced journalist caught between the ex-partnersdoing one and drugs with the other. This sort of baroque nastiness was a staple of early Egoyan. (Although in keeping with the novel's Lewis Carroll  motif, the annual pageant at the Wonderland children's clinic with a band performing "White Rabbit" and everyone wearing bunny ears is an act out of Exotica particularly as it concludes with an erotic circus back in the Hollywood Hills .) But in this relatively big-budget production, the director's main anxiety seems to be wrapping up the mystery and selling the project. However artfully designed, Where the Truth Lies  lacks the conviction of L.A. Confidential , let alone the visionary élan of Mulholland Drive .
What really happened in that hotel room that night? Was it blackmail? Suicide? Feasting on coincidence and dropping clues like bread crumbs as it circles the crime, Where the Truth Lies  posits a breakup far more psychosexually charged than anything in Dean & Me (A Love Story) . Some critics have found this well-telegraphed twist offensiveand the movie does wind up with a narrative cliché so outrageous as to constitute a Dada provocation. Salvador Dalí  would have appreciated Egoyan's use of lobsters, but given how prurient this material is, Where the Truth Lies  should really have been more fun.
