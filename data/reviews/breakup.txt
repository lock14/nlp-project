As I was leaving this considerably anticipated matchup between lovable Vaughn and the Woman Who by All Rights Should Have Had Brad�s Baby This Week, a guy said to me, �You gotta admit it�s pretty good, right? For a romantic comedy, it�s pretty good.� I will admit it: for a romantic comedy, The Break-Up
 is pretty good. It�s a pretty good genre film you see with your friends and you laugh a few times, and look � isn�t that Ann-Margret? Davis is a hoot as a gallery owner who�s oh, so catty, and she has the cutest little fey assistant (Long, who�s quite good if you like fey gallery assistants in your comedy). There are some funny flourishes in the script, written by two novices with Vaughn providing the story, and the director is sort of fluffy (Bring It On)
 but also kind of zingy (Down With Love)
 if not always precisely on the mark. It�s all put together with a sort of self-satisfaction, as if to say, �We have made a pretty good romantic comedy. We expect it to make bank pulling in mall people and a certain demographic of art people. Jon Brion�s on the soundtrack, and the Old 97�s show up. Favreau�s the buddy, and the movie deals with the parts of a relationship you never see in mainstream movies � just the ugly and gristly bits, the part where you�re having problems and unable to stay together. We think it�s kind of edgy, and did we mention that magazine readers have sympathy for Aniston right now?� So that�s pretty much what the movie aspires to be. Thirtysomething icon Aniston grieves a failed relationship in one half of the movie, while thirtysomething icon Vaughn grows up in the other. It could be a lot more than a pretty good romantic comedy. It could be good for a movie
, not just for a romantic comedy. (I�ve never really understood why the people who profess to like romantic comedies have such low standards for the form generally. Love is important, and we shouldn�t let people get away with making mediocre movies about it.) But everybody�s sleepwalking here. Vincent D�Onofrio is fantastic with Vaughn in a small part as his brother, but it�s as if he�s running in during a break from Law & Order: Criminal Intent
. Adams is a boring movie-mom who supplies the best-friend element. Throw in an oddball thing like a closeted gay brother who sings a cappella. We get Hauser as the gross brother whose misogyny and pursuit of �top-shelf, young, dumb ass� is the example of What Not to Be, Dude in the Vaughn-Favreau Universe of Masculinity. (Although it wasn�t a big deal in the indie world, the guys� earthiness seems a little stringent in this megaplex offering.) It�s a checklist of summer-movie elements arranged with enough care to suggest that it should add up to more than a pleasant diversion.


Consumer-fraud alert: You know the Jennifer Aniston/Vince Vaughn film the trailers are selling as a vengeful romantic farce a la ``The War of the Roses"? Turns out it's the feel-bad movie of the year. Some films mix comedy and drama to arrive at a higher plane. ``The Break-Up" looks at the two and is paralyzed with indecision.
It does start with a nice little kick: a pre-title sequence in which charming loudmouth Gary Grobowski (Vaughn) woos the poised Brooke Meyers (Aniston) at a Chicago Cubs game. No matter that Brooke's sitting five seats over with her boyfriend and Gary's with his crass best friend, Johnny (Jon Favreau); the two connect, and the credits unfold over candid snapshots of their subsequent long-term relationship. These photos are playful and banal; they could be your own life moments pinned up there on the screen.
Which turns out to be the problem. ``The Break-Up" proper begins a few years later, as Brooke and Gary are preparing a dinner for their families in their upscale condo. A misunderstanding over lemons turns into a tiff, which escalates into a fight, and suddenly long-nursed grievances are being aired. She does all the planning and never gets any thanks for it; he can't unwind after a long day without being nagged about picking up. He doesn't want to go to the ballet; she doesn't want a pool table in the living room.
The biggest unresolved question here is why we're paying $9.50, plus popcorn, for something we can presumably get at home for free.
Well, because it might be funny or insightful, or some combination of both. ``The Break-Up" mostly just lies there, though, alternately adoring and condemning its characters for their puppyish refusal to grow up. The couple's rift goes nuclear, with each party trying to break the other down via calculated outrages (fake boyfriends, stripper parties) and pulling their friends into the widening vortex.
Because the script insists these two really belong together, though, it never dares get interestingly mean. See ``The Puffy Chair," also opening today, for a more uncomfortably honest take on such matters.
Vaughn, who co-produced and co-wrote the original story, trades amusingly on the motormouth routine he used to steal ``Wedding Crashers" from Owen Wilson; it's cheering, as well, to see a movie hero unafraid to be a pushy, overweight schlub. ``The Break-Up" asks him to evolve into a sensitive male, though, and if he's not buying it, why should we?
As for Aniston, she's as likable as ever, but her dramatic range has never looked narrower, and if there's any heat to her real-life relationship with Vaughn, it evaporated before it reached the camera. Can Aniston play anything but Rachel 2.0? Does she even want
 to? That trapped look in Brooke's eye isn't a character in a bind; it's an actress in a rut.
The director is Peyton Reed (``Bring It On," ``Down With Love"), a stylist who seems entirely flummoxed by his material here. He tries to liven up this downer of a party with a broad, bizarre supporting cast: the raspy-voiced Joey Lauren Adams as Brooke's married friend; Peter Billingsley -- Ralphie from ``A Christmas Story" all grown up -- as her husband; Judy Davis mangling a Chicaga accent as Brooke's airy gallery-owner boss. Only two stand out from the throng: John Michael Higgins as the heroine's brother, a very
 enthusiastic a cappella singer, and Vincent D'Onofrio as Dennis, Gary's big brother and business partner.
D'Onofrio's responsible for the one moment in which ``The Break-Up" flickers briefly to life: a scene in which Dennis hectors Gary about their tour-guide company and, in the process, appears to be having a nervous breakdown that involves sticking his handkerchief in his ears. It doesn't make a lick of sense but it's a marvel to behold. Even that can't compensate for the film's waste of Ann-Margret in one wan scene as Brooke's mother.
The truth is that couples do drive each other crazy; it says so right there in the small print. Sometimes they grow closer as a result, and sometimes they fall apart, for good reasons and stupid ones. ``The Break-Up" raises the subject only to dither about the particulars, terrified the audience will be alienated.
It's too late, though: Out of the muddle comes an anti-date movie of the first order, and a generic one to boot. If they sold bickering at JC Penney
, it'd sound almost exactly like this.


         It's hard to talk about "The Break-Up," which stars Vince Vaughn and Jennifer Aniston as an uncoupling couple bound together by a condo, without getting a couple of words on Vaughn and Aniston's real-life romance, Aniston's recent real-life break-up and how "The Break-Up" compares to "Wedding Crashers" out of the way first. So here goes: Who cares?
 
  The gossip, the bad early buzz predicated on the movie's genre-confusion and inherently unhappy subject (although, if you buy a ticket for something called "The Break-Up," you should be prepared for arguments) and the tedious box-office handicapping put me in the mood to root for the movie, which is easier to do than to praise it very heartily. "The Break-Up" is more enjoyable in the moment than it is on reflection. I'd be happy to see it listed in an in-flight magazine, but "Annie Hall" it's not. It's too bad, because Vaughn, who also came up with the idea, is reliably fleet and funny, and the movie comes across as well-intentioned and more or less honest — which is better than not honest at all.
 


         






    Gary (Vaughn) and Brooke (Aniston) are an odd-ish couple living together in a condo they bought and remodeled together. Gary, who comes from a working-class Polish American family, is a tour bus operator (just go with it), who co-owns the company with his brothers Lupus (Cole Hauser), a deluded perv, and Dennis (Vincent D'Onofrio), who is socially awkward to the point of pathology. Preppy Brooke, meanwhile, comes from an upper-class family whose touchy-feeliness occasionally gets them into trouble and works at an art gallery run by a ghoulish Mary Boone type, played with over-the-top camp bravado by Judy Davis in green blush.
 
  In a brief, funny introductory sequence, we get the story of how Gary, sitting four seats away from her at a Cubs game, got Brooke to ditch the visor-wearing guy she was with and go out with him using only a hot dog. The credit sequence that follows — which is cute — consists of photos of their happy relationship. The story begins, though, on Gary coming home from work to Brooke busy in the kitchen (their families are coming over) with only three of the 12 lemons Brooke asked for. By the end of the night they have fought in public, fought in private, fought about the dishes, rehashed their old standbys, linked together every grievance in a daisy-chain of resentment, and (apparently) broken up.
 
  "The Break-Up" has been billing itself as an "anti-romantic comedy," a sort of freshly invented antidote to the smothering contemporary conventions of a genre that could definitely use some defying. In fact, it's a classic — if not very well realized — comedy of remarriage, in which the things that the protagonists once loved about each other are revealed as they fling the crockery around. The lemon argument is a classic meta-argument that starts out being about lemons and ends up being about everything else. But I'll venture out on a dry twig and suggest that "The Break-Up" might have been a lot more cathartic and interesting if first-time screenwriters Jay Lavender and Jeremy Garelick had allowed Brooke and Gary any communication at all after the initial fight. Instead, the writers seemed to react to domestic strife by immediately leaving the room, or else packing it full of funny people.
 
  There just isn't enough breaking up in "The Break-Up," in other words, for it to feel anything like one. Mostly, there's just bickering and retaliation proliferation — plus Brooke's oddly magical view (which nothing in the movie supports) that bringing a new guy over every night and getting Gary kicked off their bowling team will somehow win him back. Gary retaliates with passive-aggressive gestures, such as putting a pool table in the dining room, but ultimately the script treats the end of the relationship like Cold War escalation. There are no retreats, further miscommunication, no well-intended, personal gravedigging conversations late into the night, no breakup sex, no makeup sex, no compulsive dialing, no drinking and dialing, no ill-advised visits to therapists, I could go on. (Tony and Carmela a few seasons ago on "The Sopranos," now there was a breakup.) If the writers are to be believed, it is possible for a two-year relationship that has survived the purchase and remodeling of community property to snap like a chicken's neck after a single fight. Really? She never even tries to talk?
 
  Because they seem like OK people, even though Gary's character is given very little credit and the deck is stacked toward Brooke. As actors, Vaughn and Aniston display all sorts of human characteristics that suggest that their characters' initial attraction might have been based on some kind of ephemeral, non-mucus-membrane-related thing. And you can see how they'd be drawn to each other: She's all comforting limits, maternal control; he's a sprawl of psychic room to spread out on.
 
  The movie is at its most limber in the scenes between Vaughn and Jon Favreau as his bitter friend Johnny O, whose last-minute conversion toward frank character assessment comes out of nowhere after he's been nothing but happy to lead Gary out of his relationship by the nose. But the writers (or possibly the executives) don't trust that the story of the end of a once happy relationship can be funny or poignant without inserting not one sassy gay sidekick (Justin Long as Brooke's gallery co-worker) but two (also John Michael Higgins as Brooke's closeted gay brother, who sings in an a cappella group called the Tone Rangers).
 
  Director Peyton Reed doesn't quite bring the sharpness, litheness and attention to detail he brought to "Bring It On" and "Down With Love" to "The Break-Up," which is nonetheless alternately funny and painful. But you get the sense that his heart's not in it, that too many suggestions were made. The supporting cast, which includes Favreau, Davis, D'Onofrio, Jason Bateman, Ann-Margret, Joey Lauren Adams and Higgins, is consistently funny but crowded and underused. Fewer supporting characters (Ann-Margret's appearance is a blink) would have meant more time for the couple, who no doubt had a lot more to discuss than the movie allowed.   

When he first showed up in Swingers , that 1996 indie classic of masculine style and anxiety, Vince Vaughn had a startling shoot-to-kill glee. Taller, by a head, than anyone around him, with black-diamond eyes that gave off a glint of repressed panic, he came on like a born player but also a bit of a nutcase, with an assaultively funny motormouth rhythm all his own. (He was like Christopher Walken's hypomanic son.) This mock hipster, who liked to call his friends ''Baby,'' was himself a giant baby-man  an overgrown case of arrested cool.
The Break-Up , a synthetically hostile he said/she said cartoon of a romantic comedy (it's Friends  meets The War of the Roses ), tries to present Vaughn, for the first time, as a domesticated Hollywood leading man, but from what we can tell he's even more of a baby than before, pitching his testy patter to no one in the room but himself. Taking a cue from Will Ferrell and Adam Sandler, Vaughn flaunts a jelly belly and a slob wardrobe; he doesn't act in this film so much as he hangs out in it.
He and Jennifer Aniston play a Chicago couple who terminate their two-year relationship but keep trying to live together in the condo they co-own. As he sets up sleeping quarters opposite his beloved big-screen TV, their backbiting fits degenerate into a hatred that gets jacked up, scene by scene. She blasts Alanis Morissette's ''You Oughta Know'' and tosses his clothes out; he brings in the pool table they never had room for (though, frankly, the place looks big enough for a pool table and a bowling alley). By the time he hosts a night of strip poker, with busty bimbos smoking cigars under disco lights, you may wonder why he doesn't just go off with one of them and leave this dead shark of a relationship behind.
A lot of people will probably want to see The Break-Up , not just for the gossipy potential of its Vaughniston/Brangelina tie-ins but because the concept, which is all there is to the film, hinges on the universality of romantic implosion. We've all dumped and been dumped, and you go to see this movie for the comic jolts of recognition  the eternal war between what men and women want. That's the idea, at any rate. What The Break-Up  comes down to, though, is this: Brooke (Aniston), nice and WASPy and generous and tasteful, is a girl-next-door beauty with a classy job at an art gallery; Gary (Vaughn), a Polish prole who gives rambunctious bus tours of Chicago, doesn't do much at home besides sulk and play videogames. The movie is structured, in the screwball tradition, as a comedy of remarriage, though we can barely see what these two ever had together. A credit montage depicts their supposedly happy two-year union in a series of photographs, and then we cut to Gary arriving home before a dinner party, toting three lemons; Brooke had asked him to get 12. He objects  to going out and getting more lemons; to the lemon centerpiece she wants to create; to setting the table; to doing much of anything. (Then he disses her cooking.) This doesn't exactly look like a balanced relationship  but, more to the point, it's not a balanced comic situation.
So what's Gary's side of the story? We're meant to feel his pain when Brooke's brother, a men's-chorus leader played by John Michael Higgins from A Mighty Wind , leads the dinner table in a campy impromptu version of ''Owner of a Lonely Heart''  one of those cringe-worthy prefab audience conversation pieces designed to warm the hearts of test marketers. But why should Gary care that his girlfriend's brother is a showboating music queen? The Break-Up  makes a lame attempt to balance our sympathies, but really, it's the story of a nice girl making the eminently sensible decision to dump a psychotically selfish lout.
There are some energized arguments, even if most of them aren't very funny. Aniston, so wan in the sparkling Friends With Money , has a feistier rhythm here, but she's got to alter something  her hair, her gamine sweetness  if she wants to leave that manicured TV vibe behind her and become a movie star. The best bits are incidental: Vaughn's chats with Jon Favreau as his bartender buddy, which are delightful interludes of jostling ego, and Judy Davis, looking like Anna Wintour redesigned by Tim Burton as an undead marionette, laying down the law as Aniston's boss. I won't tell you how it all ends (other than to note that it's icky in its lack of conviction), but I will say this: Watching The Break-Up , it barely even occurred to me to think of Aniston's breakup with Brad Pitt or her current union with Vaughn. Those relationships are real. This one, in every sense, is fake.

 Gary (Vince Vaughn) and Brooke (Jennifer Aniston) first meet at a Cubs game, where he bullishly sweet-talks her away from her date, a cipher in plaid shorts and a visor. Then, after a montage of snuggly still photographs — the only images in "The Break-Up" that demonstrate anything like chemistry between its two stars — they stumble into a fight that detonates their two-year-old relationship. Unmarried cohabitants and joint owners of a yuppie-elegant Chicago condo, Brooke and Gary engage in a desultory modern version of the high-spirited sexual combat that fueled the classic comedies of remarriage of the 1930's and 40's. But the stakes are low, the script (by Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender) strains hard after a few easy jokes, and the whole movie feels dull and trivial.  To its credit, "The Break-Up," directed by Peyton Reed ("Bring It On," "Down With Love"), is not entirely predictable. In defying some of the rigid conventions of its genre, it shows some admirable pluck and wit, but these would be more appreciated if the principal characters were worth caring about or if we could believe for a moment that they cared for each other.  Each is given a job, a family and a few defining character traits. Brooke, with Ann-Margret as her briefly glimpsed mother and John Michael Higgins as her sexually ambiguous brother, manages an art gallery; Gary, from meaty Polish stock, works with his two brothers (Cole Hauser and Vincent D'Onofrio) running bus tours of the city. He's a slob; she's a perfectionist. He likes baseball; she prefers ballet. And so on.    The communication problems that wreck their unlikely (and in any case unseen) domestic bliss are strictly Mars-and-Venus, Oscar-and-Felix boilerplate. The arguments Brooke and Gary have, whether about household routines or about feelings, sound more like fumbling PowerPoint summaries of conversations than like real human speech. Mr. Reed rarely places Ms. Aniston and Mr. Vaughn in the same frame, preferring to cut tediously from one to the other. Perhaps this is meant to emphasize the rift between the former lovers, but it often makes it seem as if they are in two different movies, neither one very interesting.  Occasionally, a comic spark will issue from one of the stars, who fall back on the tried-and-true sources of their appeal. Ms. Aniston will punctuate a scene with a self-approving tilt of her head and a twitch of her adorable nose; Mr. Vaughn will talk fast and throw his bulk around, and you may smile in spite of yourself.  More frequently, what comic delight there is comes from the supporting cast: Jon Favreau as Gary's obligatory doofus buddy; Mr. D'Onofrio as his weirdly fastidious brother; Judy Davis as Brooke's vamping boss; and Jason Bateman as their friend and real estate agent in one note-perfect scene. Their efforts, unfortunately, are not enough to make "The Break-Up" memorable, or anything more than mediocre.  "The Break-Up" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some frank sexual references, brief nudity and a smattering of bad language.

Misleadingly marketed as a boisterous comedy, "The Break-Up" may be the first "last-date movie" -- the one you see with someone that you're about to dump. Sporadic rays of sunshine emanate from the broad and gifted supporting cast, but the core story is almost relentlessly unpleasant, like sitting through a dinner party where the host couple does nothing but bicker. Pic's built-in curiosity about the onscreen Vince Vaughn-Jennifer Aniston pairing should quickly dissipate faster than one of Vaughn's rat-a-tat riffs as word of mouth spreads.
Ill-conceived virtually from the opening frame as a self-described "anti-romantic comedy," Vaughn plays Gary, a Chicago tour operator who meets Brooke (Aniston) at a Cubs game. Their entire romance then unfolds in a series of pictures flashed during the opening credits, so when the audience meets them there's no sense of why they connected. Instead, the two are already engaged in the kind of shrill exchanges that generally persist for the rest of the film.
After a disastrous dinner party where Gary refuses to help clean up, Brooke dubs him an "inconsiderate prick," and it's hard to argue. Both, however, are committed to keeping the posh condo that they jointly own, so they continue living together, even as Brooke goes on dates trying to stir jealousy in Gary, who takes up residence in the living room and does little more than watch sports and play videogames.
There is vulnerability in these performances, but it's an uncomfortable mix -- especially because the rest of the cast seems to be performing in an entirely different movie during the limited screen time afforded them. Those taking best advantage of the showcase are John Michael Higgins in an amusing turn as Brooke's closeted brother, Judy Davis as her eccentric art-gallery owner boss and Vaughn's "Swingers" pal Jon Favreau as Gary's loutish friend.
Gamely as the others try, though, what transpires between the leads is painfully awkward and often not the least bit funny, from her asking their couples bowling team to oust him to him erupting at her during a game of Pictionary. Nor does the comedic conceit of broken-up people cohabiting -- the central image of the movie's ad campaign -- ever quite materialize despite vague echoes of "The Odd Couple," an inspiration cited by producer Vaughn (who also shares story credit with first-time writers Jeremy Garelick and Jay Lavender) in the production notes.
Vaughn's verbal dexterity remains impressive, and he exhibits genuine pain as well as flashes of the comedy chops that, arguably, were the strongest element in last summer's hit "Wedding Crashers." Helmer Peyton Reed ("Down With Love") has clearly given his producer-star free rein to improvise, but there's not much evidence of any direction, and the character proves almost consistently unlikable, which works against the film.
As for Aniston, she, too, delivers persuasive dramatic moments but has been so overexposed in undistinguished romantic comedies as to be ill served by showing up in another one, even if it's considerably darker than expected. And the movie's supermarket-checkout line aspects can only go so far as a marketing hook.
Pic does make reasonably good use of its Chicago locales and song score, though given how obnoxious Gary is, it's hard to imagine his bus tour representing a major attraction.
Near the end, a weary Brooke concedes, "I don't know how we got here." It's a sentiment most of the audience will doubtless share.

The Break-Up  was supposed to be the movie where Vince Vaughn  and Jennifer Aniston  got together. Instead, in a bizarro version of what Us Weekly photographed on set, their trademark good guy and girl blow their mutual affability in a dull show of falling apart. Gary is a working-class dude who wants to make it big in the Chicago tourism industry. Brooke is prepped-out old money who, despite her hard edges and artistic ambitions, plays house, washes dishes, and compromises like crazy to create a shared orbit of yuppified bliss.
It's hard not to take her side when their ship hits the fan and friends get asked to vote on which one should be cast out of their circles. Brooke, as she explains, hand on hip, lips turned down, just wants some show of appreciation in return for her wifey devotion: favors offered without being demanded; ballet tickets, just because she'd like them. And if Brooke, when she says this, sounds strident and brittle, it's only in part because she's Jennifer Aniston. Announcing that she won't spend one more minute waiting for help with the dishes isn't some declaration of independence. It's more like hoping Gary will get up off the couch.
But he can't, or won't, and this Lebowskian approach to keeping Brooke on the ball is supposed to be his charm. Faced with a long and miserable road on which they make each other sorry or crazy, both Brooke and Gary dig in hard on the least appealing parts of their stock characters. Gary gets shitfaced, commissions girls, and mopes around looking pasty. Brooke falls back on pathetic revenge maneuvers and whines mercilessly to her bossy best friend. The worst part is, her tricks don't work: Brooke's saving grace, in this strange paean to domesticity, is when she finally breaks down and cries like a girl.
