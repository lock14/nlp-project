Don�t try to figure out a time-travel movie; it will make your head hurt. And if the movie stars Keanu Reeves, it's all the more reason to just stop, slowly put common sense on the ground, and back away from your capacity for rational thought. The Lake House
 is a supernatural romance working on the premise that the laws of physics have folded upon themselves, creating a black hole within the space-time continuum � the vortex of which is located in a mailbox in rural Illinois. But while this tale of magical realism has potential for delightful originality, the love story lacks heat, the science fiction premise spirals into senselessness, and the third-act twist is alarmingly apparent within the first 10 minutes of the movie. The film tells the story of two lovers who communicate across time. In the opening moments, a wistful and newly single Kate (Bullock) moves out of the stoically romantic box of iron and glass � otherwise known as, natch, the lake house. Upon departing, she leaves a letter in the mailbox to the new tenant. When Alex (Reeves) moves in, he finds the letter, and the confusion begins. Alex lives in 2004 and Kate lives in 2006. Fevered letter-writing ensues as Kate returns to the house in order to retrieve and reply to Alex�s heartfelt letters. The two lonely souls do what is completely unexpected by absolutely no one in the audience: They fall in love. A remake of the Korean import Il Mare
, The Lake House
 marks both the reunion of Reeves and Bullock for the first time since Speed
 and one of the few Asian remakes in recent memory that�s not of the horror variety. Semicompelling subplots include fun supporting performances from Plummer, who stomps around as Alex�s overbearing father, and the ever-alluring Aghdashloo (TV�s 24
) as Kate�s only friend. But ultimately, the subplots seem tacked on and indeed are not included in the original Korean incarnation. As a romance, The Lake House
 is refreshingly low on melodrama, perhaps largely due to the subtle technique of Argentinean director Agresti (Valent�n)
. But while Bullock usually brings the energy in her films, this time around she meets Reeves squarely in his flatlined performance. And whereas Reeves is ironically believable as the ultimate salvation of all mankind (The Matrix)
 or an outrageously clueless slacker (Bill & Ted�s Excellent Adventure)
, he�s just hard to swallow as a regular Joe. As the final moments wrap up, one can�t help but contemplate the film that�s repeatedly referenced as an icon of romance throughout The Lake House
, Alfred Hitchcock�s masterpiece Notorious
. Now, that's a movie.


How deeply silly is ``The Lake House"? As silly as a movie about two letter-writing lovers separated by a wrinkle in time can be. How much sweet, dumb fun is it? More than you might want to admit.
Based on a 2000 Korean film called ``Il Mare," ``Lake House" falls squarely in the genre of overripe early-'90s chick flicks such as ``Ghost" (1990), ``Only You" (1994), and ``Untamed Heart" (1993), the last forever enshrined as ``the Christian Slater monkey heart movie." Such films believe love can break through time and the great beyond, and they're willing to employ gauzy lenses, retro pop songs, and dazed-looking Hollywood stars to seduce moviegoers into their tender traps.
You can enjoy a movie like this straight up and have a good, happy cry, or you can enjoy it as an outrageous camp hoot. Either way, the most appropriate setting probably isn't a movie theater but your own couch late at night -- blanket and Ben & Jerry's optional. It's called romantic melodrama, children, and it's nothing to be ashamed of.
Here's where I tell you about the plot, and be advised that it makes as much sense as eggs at a barbecue. Dr. Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock) moves out of her lakefront house -- a glass-and-steel contraption that looks like one of Frank Lloyd Wright's minor burps -- and leaves a note in the mailbox telling the new renter where to forward her mail. Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), a hunky, disaffected architect, moves in and leaves a tart note in response.
Wouldn't he want to send it to her apartment? Of course he wouldn't; on some level he already knows this is a magic mailbox. Kate drives out one day from her job patching up ER cases with head nurse Shohreh Aghdashloo , reads the note, and leaves another. And so their epistolary pas de deux begins. It's not as lyrical as the one Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan had going in ``The Shop Around the Corner," but Reeves and Bullock are such engaging lunkheads that you go with it.
There's a catch, of course. She's living in 2006. He's living in 2004. That means Alex is renting the lake house before
 Kate. This is a harder nut to crack than a bi-coastal relationship: It's bi-temporal.
Within this set up, director Alejandro Agresti and scripter David Auburn -- he wrote the higher-math sudser ``Proof" and is clearly employing arcane romantic algorithms here -- ring all sorts of guilty-pleasure twists. For instance: Alex sends Kate on a walking tour of Chicago that ends with a wall on which he spray-painted a message two years earlier.
In the film's most shamelessly sappy scene, he shows up at a 2004 bash thrown by her then-boyfriend (Dylan Walsh) and woos her with words and a backyard slow dance to Paul McCartney's ``This Never Happened Before." (Good title, since the song didn't come out until late 2005.) Suddenly Kate's new memory comes flooding in: He's
 the guy she kissed at that party two years earlier.
By this point, the part of your brain that likes kittens has thrown in the towel. The part of your brain that pays the bills is saying, ``Now wait just a minute." Why couldn't Kate send Alex her 2004 e-mail address or phone number and tell him to just bluff it out? Why couldn't he tell her where he lives in 2006? Watching them stare at that mailbox until the tin flag flies up of its own accord wears thin after a while; listening to them ``talk" their letters to the air is absurd from the get-go.
There are complications, and there's much busy acting from the supporting players, especially Christopher Plummer as Alex's dad, a famous architect with an ego bigger than any of his buildings. (Plummer has a wonderful speech toward the end about how architecture captures the light; it feels cut-and-pasted from one of Auburn's serious plays.)
Reeves and Bullock are perfectly matched, though: they seem to belong to the same species -- they're the black labs of movie stars. Together for the first time since ``Speed," the two fire off mild wisecracks in one scene and look terribly wistful in the next, and that's all that's required. Even though they're hardly on screen together, there's more chemistry here than in all of ``The Break-Up."
Anyway, Agresti and Auburn know who their audience is, and it's not alpha males. As soon as Kate lets drop that her favorite author is Jane Austen and the Nick Drake songs kick in on the soundtrack, you know this movie won't be taking any prisoners. Don't fight it with logic, because you'll lose. ``The Lake House" understands we all have moments of bad timing in our lives, but nothing like this. This
 is gloriously ridiculous.

         Well, lordy, if I
 found a lake house that looked like that
, I'd make a movie about it, too. In the paranormal romance "The Lake House," Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves are brought together and gently coaxed into love by their shared tenancy — two years apart — of a jewel-like waterfront property, a lyrical glass-and-iron Art Nouveau bird-cage/terrarium on stilts. The trouble: They seem to have snagged themselves on some kind of nasty wrinkle in the time-space continuum. He's living in 2004, and she's living in 2006, simultaneously. How's that for a romantic obstacle, John Grey fans?
 
  In 2006, a young doctor named Kate (Bullock) finishes her residency in a small North Shore hospital and moves to Chicago to begin a job at a hospital in the city, reluctantly leaving behind the lake house she's been renting. On moving out, she leaves a note in the mailbox apologizing for the painted paw prints in the entrance, and asking the new tenant to forward her mail to her new address. Already mopey, she witnesses a man get hit by a bus on one of her first days off.
 


         






    Meanwhile, back at the lake house, the new tenant is moving in. He is Alex Wyler (Reeves), an architect and condo developer, whose distant and imperious father (you know how those legendary architects are), William Wyler (Christopher Plummer), built the house for his wife long ago. Alex has been around the world trying to forget — or forgive — his dad for being such a Frank Lloyd Wright groupie and all-around pill. Now he's come home to build ugly housing for the condo-crazed masses, and to make the lake house a little more user-friendly.
 
  When he finds the letter from Kate, Alex is befuddled. He knows for a fact that the lake house has been empty for years, and there are no paw prints anywhere. The next morning, however, a cute stray dog appears out of nowhere, tracking paint in the entranceway. How could Kate have known about the dog? He writes back, and displaying a charming but fortuitous ignorance of the workings of the U.S. postal system, sticks the letter in the lake house's mail box. Kate returns and finds it, and they begin a lively, time-warping correspondence, bickering about what year it is.
 
  They never do get around to discussing what's happening, or how it happened, whether NASA should be alerted, or what it means. But why bother? They sound cute! Instead, Alex and Kate do what by now millions of Match.com clients worldwide could tell them not to do: They start falling madly in love based on cutely worded getting-to-know you notes. (A sample: "I'm a doctor, trying to cure the sick." "I'm an architect. I like to build.") They swap turn-ons and turn-offs. (Turn-on: "When I smell the flowers before I see them.") And they pine. They also exchange reminiscences, which, when they happen to be Kate's, allow Alex to try to track her down to her past.
 
  A brief aside: I'm starting to formulate a theory about Keanu Reeves. I think he is the Al Gore of the acting world. He's thoroughly unobjectionable. He seems like a very solid guy. You want to like him, even. But he's, how do you say, wooden. A little on the stiff side. Alex does succeed in tracking Kate down in 2004, on her birthday, when he gets himself invited to a party thrown by her then boyfriend, Morgan (Dylan Walsh). They share a moment at the party — but Alex is just sane enough to refrain from spilling the beans about their future relationship. Sadly, he doesn't choose to pursue the relationship in his present, either, even though Kate is clearly open to new experiences. Then again, he's a simple guy. He likes to build.
 
  Directed by Alejandro Agresti ("Valentín") and written by David Auburn ("Proof"), "The Lake House" is a chronological brain-teaser confounding enough to keep you busy trying to figure out whether those holes are in the story or in your logic. But ultimately the movie is more interested in the love part of the equation than in the whole crazy, madcap physics part, so it's never really explained how Alex is supposed to catch up to Kate, how it was that they were once on the same plane but got separated, or how it is, with so many naturally occurring obstacles to love existing in the real world, anyone thought this would make a good premise.
 
  Twice in the course of the film, a character watches bits of "Notorious" on TV, which seems odd — like someone dug up the wrong Cary Grant movie. The more appropriate reference would have been Grant and Deborah Kerr's "An Affair to Remember," a weepy in which the lovers are kept apart by contrived but hardly idiotic circumstances.
 
  "The Lake House" shares several key characteristics with that movie, not to mention a couple of scenes. Except for the part where it's revealed that Cary Grant is actually an alien from outer space, and Deborah Kerr knows it's crazy but loves him anyway, they actually have quite a lot in common.

In the chemistry-challenged specimen of serendipity and romantic fate-tampering called The Lake House , Kate Forster (Sandra Bullock), a melancholy but pretty Chicago doctor living in 2006, meets her soul mate, Alex Wyler (Keanu Reeves), a melancholy but pretty architect whose only drawback as boyfriend material is that he's living in 2004. And not just in his mind, but in reality: The man really exists in a world two years less spam-filled than Kate's. No problemo. Somehow, via wrinkles in the time-space continuum and fairy dust in the sugar bowl, Kate and Alex are able to communicate with one another from the past to the present. Or is it the present to the past?
Either way, the two bond over their love of the title piece of real estate, a melancholy but pretty glass structure as light-filled, camera-ready, and difficult to get to (it's built on piles thrusting up from the water) as a movie star's trophy weekend home designed by a celebrity architect. Kate, who used to rent the place before she moved back to Chicago (to be lonely, work in a hospital, and absorb woman-to-woman advice from Shohreh Aghdashloo as her ER colleague), leaves a note for ''the next tenant.'' And the next tenant  actually, of course, he used to live there in the past, when the structure was neglected  turns out to be Alex, whose crotchety celebrity architect of a father (Christopher Plummer) built the joint in the first place. (It's so not worth being confused here.)
The only real magic in The Lake House  is that Kate and Alex have never heard of e-mail: They write to one another in beautifully penned handwriting, on creamy stationery folded into crisp envelopes and stashed in a magic mailbox with an old-fashioned you've-got-mail flag right out of a Norman Rockwell painting. Freaky! Maybe Alex and Kate actually simultaneously live in 1954 and 1956 and 2004 and 2006!
I never saw Il Mare , the 2000 South Korean film picked up by producers Doug Davison and Roy Lee for export, dismantling, and American retrofitting. (The duo transformed the Asian thrillers Ju-On  and Ringu  into the American hits The Grudge  and The Ring .) So I can't report what East-to-West challenges  not to mention Bullock-and-Reeves headliner requirements  bested Proof playwright David Auburn as he wrestled the original into a shape suitable for an American audience. But we've all seen Bullock and Reeves (apart and, once, together), and it's clear that Argentinean director Alejandro Agresti, best known in the U.S. for his sugary coming-of-age drama Valentin , has put too much faith in audience fondness for that cute duo who starred in Speed  a dozen years ago. Now the stars are doing Slow   she's winsome on cue, he's pained.
It's as if The Lake House  team decided that the easiest way to deal with the pesky time-warp thing would be to ram the notion through, counting on viewers sticking around for star smooching. Call me an unromantic logician, but I think the expectation is a leap too far.

 "The Lake House," a wondrously illogical time-travel romance directed by Alejandro Agresti, is notable mainly for reuniting Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, who together survived a harrowing bus ride in "Speed." That was 12 years ago — how time flies! — and since then they have gone their separate movie-star ways, into the "Miss Congeniality" and "Matrix" franchises, as well as into a startlingly long list of bad movies, of which I will mention only "Hope Floats" and "Sweet November."  But these two stars have a habit of being more appealing than their material. This is not just a matter of excellent facial bone structure, but also of a sly ability to play simultaneously in and against type. Because Ms. Bullock and Mr. Reeves have become such familiar screen presences, their performances turn out, more often than not, to be genuinely surprising. Ms. Bullock likes to be difficult, to temper her radiance with grouchiness, while Mr. Reeves, when the mood strikes, can inflect his mild, baffled affect with meanness, moodiness and even a hint of thorny intelligence.  So while the general public has not, as far as I can tell, been clamoring for a reunion, "The Lake House" nonetheless functions as a fascinating experiment. Is the chemistry — or, given that "Speed" was all about the velocity of bodies in motion, the physics — still there? It is, although in this case the viewer will also have to grapple with a heavy dose of Hollywood metaphysics, which keeps the leads apart for most of the movie.  At the start, Ms. Bullock's character, Kate, a stressed-out physician who has just completed her residency, moves out of the architectural curiosity that gives the picture its title, leaving a note in the mailbox for the next tenant. That would be Mr. Reeves's Alex, a soulful real estate developer who turns out actually to be the previous tenant. Some unexplained wrinkle in the space-time continuum — or  a serious glitch at the postal service — has made it possible for Kate, in 2006, to correspond with Alex, who is still making his way through 2004.  "Not much has changed," Kate writes to him at one point, when he asks what things are like in the future. His general lack of curiosity — he doesn't ask who won the presidential election or the World Series, or pester her for stock market tips — is in keeping with the fuzziness of the film's conceit. If you approach it with a rational, skeptical mind, "The Lake House" will fall apart almost immediately. But where is the fun in that? You'll just have to accept that a book can travel through the mail to a date earlier than the one printed on its copyright page, and that a fancy Chicago restaurant will hold an unconfirmed reservation for two years.    "The Lake House," while completely preposterous, is not without charm. Both Kate and Alex drive well-preserved old cars — hers is a copper-colored Mustang that appears to be of late-60's vintage, while his pickup truck looks even older — and the movie they inhabit, based on a Korean film called "Il Mare," is an unapologetic throwback to a classic studio genre, the melodrama of impossible love. The social obstacles that used to exist — in the real world and, more intensely, in Production Code-governed Hollywood — have lost their forbidding power, which may be why supernatural and science fiction touches are required to keep the idea of romantic longing alive.  Kate and Alex, by means of handwritten letters placed in that mailbox (and read in back-and-forth voice- over to simulate real-time conversations), fall deeply and achingly in love. There is some competition for their affection. Alex is coolly, almost sadistically indifferent to a co-worker (Lynn Collins) who all but throws herself at his feet, while Kate has recently broken up with a perfectly decent but manifestly inadequate fiancé (Dylan Walsh), who keeps showing up no matter what year it is. She also has a gentle mother (Willeke van Ammelrooy) and a wise boss (Shohreh Aghdashloo), who serve as confidantes, while Alex is burdened with an imperious, narcissistic father (Christopher Plummer), a famous architect who designed that strange, impractical house by the lake.  The contrivances of the plot, which may require occasional glances at a multiyear date book, are smoothly handled by David Auburn's script and by Mr. Agresti's direction. Visually, "The Lake House" is elegant without being terribly showy, with a connoisseur's eye for Chicago's architectural glories. But the movie is, above all, a showcase for its stars, who seem gratifyingly comfortable in their own skin and delighted to be in each other's company again, in another deeply silly, effortlessly entertaining movie.  "The Lake House" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has occasional dark moods and sad moments, but no bad language or sex.

A peculiar wrinkle in time links two Chicago lonely hearts in "The Lake House," but director Alejandro Agresti and screenwriter David Auburn seem more interested in making a wanly romantic Hallmark postcard than a movie resonating with mystery and loss. Based on Lee Hyeon-seung's 2000 Korean romancer "Il Mare," pic reps one of the first Hollywood remakes of a recent East Asian film not belonging to the horror genre. But pic lacks the astonishing moments, strong emotions or real amusement -- let alone real heat between co-leads Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock -- that would encourage more remakes of its kind or generate any feeling in audiences other than indifference. 
A mailbox at a home built on stilts over a body of water becomes a conduit for a pair of the home's occupants separated by a two-year time span in the original cute but finally messy "Il Mare" story. This time, it feels strained.
The sheer fun of being in the position of Dr. Kate Forster (Bullock) or architect Alex Wyler (Reeves) and communicating with a stranger across time is filtered out of Argentine helmer Agresti's ("Valentin," "The Act in Question") handling, with pic aiming for profundity through multiple story levels that aren't fully realized.
Opening minutes almost exactly trace "Il Mare," with Kate packing and moving from the glass-box-style house perched over Lake Michigan on Chicago's North Shore, and Alex moving in, finding a note from Kate in the mailbox requesting her mail be forwarded and apologizing for the dog paw prints at the entrance.
Alex doesn't see any paw prints, but a day or so later, a dog appears and makes a mess. As the pair starts exchanging puzzled notes, Kate corrects Alex on his dating, noting that it's 2006, not 2004.
Agresti has the mailbox's red flag go magically up and down to show Alex and Kate are connecting -- a clever visual device. Nonetheless, one wonders why, when the twosome are clearly growing interested in one another, Kate doesn't simply give Alex her phone number.
The adaptation by Auburn ("Proof") departs from the original in the half-achieved dramatization of Kate's (other) love life and Alex's family life, particularly in the complicated interaction between Alex, his father Simon (Christopher Plummer) and Alex's younger brother Henry (Ebon Moss-Bachrach).
Even as Kate's involvement with buttoned-down lawyer Morgan (Dylan Walsh) leads to potential frissons of emotions that never ignite, the playing out of Alex's love-hate relationship with Simon uneasily tries to draw connections between the main love story and a father-son drama that poses the same sort of tensions between a genius parent and unsure mentor-child as in "Proof," but with far less conviction.
"The Lake House" is never quite sure what it wants to be --a magical-mysterious love story, a psychodrama, a sprawling family saga, or an uneasy combination of these. For all its manifest nonsense, "Il Mare" maintained direction as a chamber piece between two characters trying to connect across time, if not space; "The Lake House" aspires to be more and in the process, loses track of its central core.
Bullock makes the rather glum n' solemn Kate a shade glummer, bringing the movie's energy level down several stops. Reeves, on the other hand, seems pleased when his Alex senses that true love is entering his life.
In a fatuously written role, Plummer loads on the ham to distressing effect, while Shohreh Aghdashloo (as Kate's doctor friend) and Walsh are burdened with poorly conceived dialogue. Moss-Bachrach contributes a nice accent of friskiness.
Production package is solid though uninspired, including a Rachel Portman score that hints that the talented composer is repeating herself once too often and a misty-eyed lensing scheme by Alar Kivilo. Key contribution by production designer Nathan Crowley, a house you might not want to really live in, is far from memorable.

Treading the same supernatural turf trampled by Somewhere in Time  and Frequency , director Alejandro Agresti 's gooey, ostensibly spooky romance yarn The Lake House  flounders less on its thudding familiarity than on its mood- killing dourness. Watching it is like being force-fed cotton candy laced with Xanax  (or vice versa). A remake of the 2000 South Korean film Siworae , Lake House  tracks two mopey Chicago professionals (Sandra Bullock  and Keanu Reeves ) who separately yet simultaneously inhabit a pomo suburban eyesore in two distinct years. They develop a mutual letch via perky missives and a mystical mailbox, and conspire to bridge the temporal gap. Crackpot Twilight Zone  hook and persistent gloom notwithstanding, Agresti's film offers a few satisfactorily weepy scenes and an uncharacteristically loose performance from Reeves (Bullock just seems irked), but it succeeds best as a metaphor for the relationship woes of indecisive urbanites. With their impossible-to-fill expectations and utter self-centeredness, these mokes should be giddy over landing in a relationship committed only to the intangibl.e.
