Let's cut to the chase here and now, since this tepid, borderline-offensive cyber-serial-killer thriller takes what feels like ages to rehash both better and worse examples of the current, vapid clamor for so-called "torture porn." Untraceable
 strives to gussy up its narrative cheat sheet (stolen from the still-warm bodies of Saw
, Se7en
, and Feardotcom
, among others) with an outraged tone, but the blatant, transparent hypocrisy inherent in the story is what's really annoying. The always-reliable Lane is cast as FBI Cyber Crimes Agent Jennifer Marsh, a doting mom and widow working out of Portland, Ore., who with trusty hack-happy partner Griffin Dowd (Hanks) nightly trolls the dingy back alleys of the Internet for the usual collection of predators, frauds, and scam artists. Things take a turn for the obvious when she's tipped off to the existence of a live-streaming site called KillWithMe.com
 that allows visitors to participate virtually in a real-time execution: The more people log on to the site, the faster the victim dies. Agent Marsh, who should know better, is initially shocked at the exponentially rising hits the site attracts and at one point even goes so far as to drop a none-too-subtle reference to murdered Wall Street Journal
 reporter Daniel Pearl into an ill-conceived harangue on the bloodthirsty, voyeuristic tendencies of your average American. (Her Portland PD buddy muses aloud, "When did the world go insane?") Apart from the fact that mankind, and in particular, America � Google Earth anyone? � has always been fascinated with voyeurism, not to mention the viewpoints of Eros and Thanatos and the intersection thereof, Untraceable
 renders the audience complicit in the film's violent shenanigans by virtue of watching the gore onscreen. It's a weird, schizophrenic tack for a film about a deranged serial killer to take, and it leaves you feeling as if you'd just been scolded for going to the movies in the first place. God forbid anyone should ever want to watch footage of a Baghdad MASH unit to survey the real � as opposed to reel
 � hyperviolence of Our Insane World.


For all its cyber-savvy talk of botnets and backdoor Trojans, "Untraceable" still manages to feel dated.
It's a warmed-over suspense thriller that's more disturbing than it is surprising or scary. Then again, it does have lovely Diane Lane, so a fresh dramatic premise could be considered an optional accessory.
Gregory Hoblit ("Fracture," "Primal Fear") directs the handiwork of writers Allison Burnett ("Autumn in New York"), Robert Fyvolent, and Mark R. Brinker. Their screenplay begins as something familiar but promising: There's a serial killer on the loose, this time terrorizing Portland, Ore., with a decidedly 21st-century M.O.
The predator tortures his prey on camera, escalating the violence with every person who clicks on his website to watch. When his site reaches a predetermined amount of traffic, the victim - be it a kitten stuck to the floor or a bound man bleeding out from an overdose of heparin - meets a gruesome, untimely end in front of millions of viewers.
Outrageous? Absolutely.
Possible? As the movie pointedly notes, technology already lets us download weather reports, check stock quotes, and "see a journalist get his head cut off." Consider the number of cellphones recently used to capture actor Heath Ledger's body being removed from his apartment in a body bag. If there's a limit to voyeurism and bad taste, it's at least open for discussion. And that's where "Untraceable" could have launched into some truly innovative storytelling.
Instead, it chooses to roll out a standard tale of revenge, with an overworked single mom (when will they get their priorities straight?) at its center.
Lane plays Special Agent Jennifer Marsh, a dedicated member of the FBI's fast-growing cyber-crimes division. Her young partner (Colin Hanks) is equally dedicated, and just sketchy enough to make you think he might be moonlighting as the bad guy. You don't have to wonder long, though, because the killer is revealed less than an hour into the movie. From there, it's all about connecting the dots and stopping the madness before the next victim is Marsh herself.
If you don't know how this ends, you don't watch enough TV.
Marsh gets help from a handsome police detective (Billy Burke) who brings her dinner when she's forced to take refuge in a motel. And even though she conveniently misplaces her brain for most of the movie's silly final act, she regains it just in time to (spoiler alert) rescue herself from the whirling jaws of death in a manner that would make any of Charlie's Angels proud.
Hoblit and veteran cinematographer Anastas Michos try to darken the proceedings by giving us nocturnal characters and Portland at its grayest. But it's window dressing, just like the layers of computer geek-speak that can't disguise an analog-age plot.
"Untraceable" is neither suspenseful nor thrilling, and it's also not grisly or twisted enough for fans of mainstream torture porn.
It does have Diane Lane, though.

Is Unfaithful  and Under the Tuscan Sun  star Diane Lane just randomly picking movies that start with the letters U  and N ? On this evidence, quite possibly. She plays a widowed, cybercrime-investigating FBI agent on the trail of a creep who kills people in various grisly ways and broadcasts it live over the Internet. The twist? The more people who log on to the sicko's website, the quicker the victim bleeds out/fries to death/becomes the piquant seasoning in a sulfuric acid soup. That's right  the real perp is you (or possibly YouTube). Then the homicidal maniac hacks his way into Lane's computer and her own life is put at risk, as are the lives of her predictably cute daughter and mom.
Lane skillfully sells the tech-heavy script. But after a much-too-early reveal of the murderer's identity, the ''low battery'' signal starts to flash on this film by thriller specialist Gregory Hoblit, director of last year's far superior Fracture . Moreover, it seems a bit rich to criticize the public's appetite for watching grisly images while serving up scenes of torture porn that, in terms of visceral horror, come close to rivaling the nastiest moments of the Hostel  or Saw  franchises. The hypocrisy is, well, undeniable.

 Morally duplicitous torture porn: how else to describe “Untraceable,” a bleak, rain-washed horror thriller whose predatory villain delivers a scolding lecture about Internet voyeurism and the dark side of human nature? That lecture arrives as a contemptuous “I told you so” at the end of the movie, after the designated fiend has streamed live video of several of his hideous crimes on his own Web site, killwithme.com.  Paragraphs of technobabble spouted by Special Agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) of the F.B.I.’s cybercrime unit in Portland, Ore., explain why the Web site is untraceable. It takes a cyberwizard like Jennifer to catch a cyberwizard. Meanwhile the murders are carried out with different elaborate devices, each of which suggests a high-tech variation of something out of Edgar Allan Poe.  The killer’s cruel joke: The more people who visit the site, the faster the victims die. A counter records the accelerating number of hits as each new torture is unveiled. More than 27 million viewers rush to watch the spectacle of a woman strung upside down from the ceiling, as she is lowered inch by inch over rotating blades. Another victim is strapped inside a tank of water into which sulfuric acid is slowly dripped. Although his head and shoulders remain above water, the skin below peels away like wads of pink tissue paper as his eyes bug out and his face turns crimson.  The moral lesson: The act of watching makes us accessories to murder; without an audience, no one would die.  You may view “Untraceable,” as I do, as a repugnant example of the voyeurism it pretends to condemn. Or you may stand back and see it as a cleverly conceived, slickly executed genre movie that ranks somewhere between “Seven” and the “Saw” movies in sadistic ingenuity.  Gregory Hoblit, the director, was a producer and director on “L.A. Law” and “Hill Street Blues” in the 1980s and “NYPD Blue” in the 1990s. His best-known film, “Primal Fear,” made a star of Edward Norton in 1996. He has the clammy visual vocabulary and jittery rhythm of the crime-fighting movie down cold.  The killer’s spree begins with a grisly test run on a cat, in which he promises viewers to kill the animal once his site gets a certain number of hits. Jennifer, the smartest investigator in her unit, immediately intuits that this is just a prelude to something much worse.  The movie gives her a possible romantic interest in her fellow detective Eric (Billy Burke), who hovers protectively around her but keeps his hands off. She also has a nerdy younger partner, Griffin (Colin Hanks, Tom’s son), whose habit of making blind dates with women on the Internet leads him into the killer’s lair.  Jennifer is a stereotypically vulnerable target, a widowed single mother who lives in a dark, drafty house with her own mother, Stella (Mary Beth Hurt); her 8-year-old daughter, Annie (Perla Haney-Jardine); and a cat with a sixth sense. The place is begging to be invaded by a kidnapper, and the movie can’t resist toying with your fear that it is only a matter of time before either Jennifer or her daughter, or both, land in the killer’s gadget-clogged cellar.  Bringing her usual intensity to the role, Ms. Lane succeeds in making Jennifer a conflicted woman of some depth who is torn between her professional commitment and her family. The role of a high-strung thoroughbred with a streak of stubborn independence is one she has played before.  Lightness does not come easily to Ms. Lane. Even in her characters’ upbeat moments, you sense the shadows under the surface. The clench of her jaw, the taut tendons of her neck and her rigid posture evoke a loner bravely gritting her teeth as she gazes steadily into the darkness.  As cynical as it is, “Untraceable” leaves a sharp, lingering aftertaste. When the killer crows that it won’t be long before we are paying to download commercially sponsored atrocities on our cellphones, you have the uneasy feeling that he may be right.  “Untraceable” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and scenes of torture.

Unfolding like a better-than-average episode of a first-rate TV police procedural, "Untraceable" is a satisfying slice of solidly crafted meat-and-potatoes filmmaking. Diane Lane heads a cast of thoroughgoing professionals who breathe a fair degree of fresh life into stock characters, and the formulaic plot is enlivened with bracingly acerbic observations about Internet-enabled voyeurism. Aggressive marketing -- and a fortuitous lack of similar product in the marketplace -- may enable this latest thriller from helmer Gregory Hoblit ( "Fracture,""Primal Fear") to draw genre fans to megaplexes before pic begins a long life on vidstore shelves and cable network playlists.
Working from a script credited to Robert Fyvolent, Mark R. Brinker and Allison Burnett, Hoblit (whose early experience as a director on "Hill Street Blues" and "NYPD Blue" serves him well here) focuses on the crime-busting activities of an FBI cybercrimes unit in the bureau's Portland, Ore., field office. Usually, special agents Jennifer Marsh (Lane), a widowed single mother, and Griffith Dowd (Colin Hanks), her younger, nerdier partner, set their sights on sexual predators and credit-card scammers. But the stakes are raised when they discover someone on the Web has developed an attention-grabbing killer app.
The anonymous psycho behind killwithme.com starts out small, trapping a kitten and promising to kill the cat once his "untraceable" site gets a sufficient number of hits. When the maniac Webmaster makes good on his promise, Marsh assumes it's only a matter of time before human victims are placed at risk in live downstreaming videos. And sure enough, the psycho lives down to her worst expectations, rigging torture devices that grow increasing painful, and eventually lethal, as millions of voyeurs worldwide click on to watch the real-time action.
Alert auds will note just how rigorously Hoblit and his scripters adhere to the law of Chekhov's gun: If you introduce a firearm in the first act, you must use it in the third. While watching a victim writhing in agony on killwithme.com, someone notes that it would be great if said victim could blink Morse code directions to his whereabouts -- suffice it to say that blinking then figures into the plot in a way of which Chekhov would approve.
Unfortunately, the filmmakers shoot themselves in the foot and leave a gaping hole in their narrative by not revealing the ultimate fates of two key characters during their otherwise effective wrap-up.
Given the serial killer's ingeniously grisly means of dispatching his captives -- acid baths, megawatt sun-lamps, etc. -- and the prevailing atmosphere of impending doom in a rainy Pacific Northwest setting, "Untraceable" cannot help but invite comparisons to "Seven." New pic is hardly in the same league as David Fincher's influential thriller, but it does keep the aud consistently discomforted -- in all the right ways -- while sustaining interest and maintaining suspense.
Lane strikes the perfect balance of resourcefulness and sensitivity in a quietly forceful performance that efficiently propels the action. Billy Burke lends strong support as a Portland cop who aids in the investigation -- wisely, the filmmakers avoid the obvious while developing his relationship with Marsh -- while Joseph Cross is both oddly compelling and formidably creepy as the Webmaster from hell. Other standouts in the supporting cast include Mary Beth Hurt as Marsh's mom, Perla Haney-Jardine as Marsh's young daughter, and Hanks as the FBI agent who goes looking for love in all the wrong places.
Credit lenser Anastas Michos for making Portland look and feel like a moody, gloomy place where the worst things can happen at any moment. Other tech credits are pro.

Regarding the irrelevance of Untraceable : First of all, torture is so  2007, and just because this drab little thriller with a flashy love of pain imagines itself a "critique of violence" doesn't make it any less superfluous. Second of all, untraceable? Ha! You wish. While it's true that the villain of our tale, a precocious psychopath hosting real-time snuff videos on the Internet, proves tricky to hunt down, the provenance of the movie itself is pitch-meeting obvious: The Silence of the Lambs meets Saw , dude.
Diane Lane  straps on the Clarice Starling  stuff as Jennifer Marsh , special agent in the FBI  cyber-crime unit in Portland, Oregon . Alerted to the website killwithme.com by an anonymous tipster, Marsh and her geeky sidekick Griffin Dowd  (Colin Hanks ) watch in horror as some online nutjob tortures and kills Lulu the cat. "This is just the beginning!" notes our prophetic heroine, and so it shall befor B-thriller boilerplate ("My guess? None of it's random!") among other unpleasantries.
Enter Eric Box  (Billy Burke ), generic fox, a homicide detective packing bedroom eyes and penetrating existential queries. "When did the world go so fucking insane?" he wonders, as the Internet killer upgrades his crazy on human prey. Propped upright before a webcam, bleeding from deep incisions spelling "Want to kill with me?" across his chest, the latest victim is plugged into an anti-coagulant IV drip synched to a page-hit counter. The more people that watch, the quicker the drip goes; the quicker the drip, the faster he dies. His life, you see, depends entirely on . . . you! You as in YouTube, Time magazine  person-of-the-year you, sadistic, voyeuristic, media-addled you. Hella subversive, no? Can't stop watching, can you? Feeling just a wee bit implicated , hmm?
Next up on KillWithMe: Some poor chap gets hogtied to a battery of heat lamps (much relishing of grotesque blister f/x here); another gets dunked in a tank of water slowly mixed with acid (there will be blood, and more attention is paid to the verisimilitude of peeling flesh than the character suffering the peel). Untraceable being a movie about the effect of violence in the media, or whatever, each new murder scenario wraps quicker than the last, as hordes of new viewers log on to gawk at torture and snark it up on the message board. Damn you, media! Damn you, you!
Meanwhile, the mastermind of this elaborate nastiness, a disgruntled twerp named Owen (Joseph Cross ), gloats in his basement lair amid batteries of computer equipment and the requisite flickering fluorescents, cork-board collages, and canned-fetus art installations of the contemporary cinematic serial killer.
Directed by Gregory Hoblit  from a screenplay by a trio (a trio!) of whomevers, Untraceable hasn't the brains of a class-act psychothriller like The Silence of the Lambs (though it does reprise that film's titillating homophobia); worse yet, it lacks the balls to juice up the trashy verve of the Saw  series. Stuck in the middle, it leaves everyone stranded, actors and audience alike. Lane, poor thing, acts the pro, cool and confident, keeping as dry as she can in this sad, soggy affairspeaking of which, I know this is the Pacific Northwest  and everything, but yo, Hoblit, it doesn't rain this much in the Amazon, and it isn't this dark on the dark side of the moon.
