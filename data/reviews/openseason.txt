Sometime over the last 15 years, an animated-blockbuster formula was carved onto stone tablets by Disney and brought down from the Verdugo Mountains above Burbank to the studios below. The formula was easy to follow and seemed to guarantee a profit, so, save for a few exceptions, the studios and filmmakers followed it faithfully. Take an odd coupling of bumbling animals � the tablets decreed, one large and fussy, the other small and volatile � send them out on an adventure together with little but the charm of their celebrity voices to protect them, pit them against an antagonist of frothing hostility (not evil, mind you, like in the classic Disney films of the Forties and Fifties or modern-day Japanese anime movies � just low-grade comic petulance), and stand back as bumper-sticker lessons about friendship and loyalty crowd the screen. Open Season
 follows this formula to the letter; for directors Allers, Culton, and Stacchi, there�s obviously safety in box-office numbers. Open Season
�s tale of a domesticated grizzly bear, Boog (Lawrence); his sidekick, Elliot (an antic mule deer voiced by Kutcher); and their quest to find their way back home after being deposited deep in the woods � fighting off a delusional hunter and becoming best friends as they go � is long on manic energy and bathroom humor but short on real storytelling, emotion, or characters. I realize we�re talking about a children�s movie here, and the squealing hordes of 5-year-olds at the screening I went to seemed to like Open Season
 just fine, but even kids deserve movies that strive to be inventive and surprising, rather than just lazy, clich�d, prepackaged nonsense. They�re our future, after all. Me, I don�t worry about a generation of kids who�ve been reared on a steady diet of cinematic violence and sex; I worry about a generation of kids who grow up watching movies that mistake clamor for originality, irony for imagination, and pop-culture references for storytelling. I worry about a generation of kids who think Ashton Kutcher is funny. The thought makes my blood run cold. The directors of Open Season
 had hands in creating classics like The Lion King
, Monsters, Inc.
, and Toy Story
, and they do an admirable job of making their movie sparkle and shine with CGI glitter. But despite this pedigree and craftsmanship, Open Season
 is little more than paint-by-numbers filmmaking, and it fails in the most important charge of any children�s movie: to transport its young and impressionable audience to a world where anything is possible, rather than to one where everything�s been thought of already.


It's the least imaginative animation idea in cinema: cartoon animals endangered by cartoon hunters. Still, as cartoon rip-offs go, ``Open Season" can be surprisingly entertaining, in a made-for-6-year-olds kind of way.
Assembled by filmmakers Roger Allers (co-director of ``The Lion King"), Jill Culton, and Anthony Stacchi, this cuddly computer-generated first feature from Sony
 Pictures Animation probably deserves every bit of the disdain it's generating from creative corners of the industry. When your most distinctive element is Ashton Kutcher as a one-antlered mule deer, respect has reason to elude you. But a funny thing happens to ``Open Season" on the way to the compost heap: It refuses to lie down and die.
Even though its premise is embarrassingly tired -- a domesticated grizzly bear named Boog (Martin Lawrence) has to leave his forest-ranger surrogate mom (Debra Messing) and outsmart hunters while he makes furry friends and learns to survive in the wild -- the screenplay by Nat ``Doctor Dolittle" Mauldin and ``Chicken Little"/``Brother Bear" scribes Steve Bencich and Ron J. Friedman (fleshing out an idea by comic-strip creator Steve Moore and producer John Carls) has just enough spunk and giggles to occasionally win you over.
Generic computer animation techniques are rescued by a level of detail that extends right down to the textured fur on Boog's back and the in-your-face pull of a rushing mountain stream. And stock characters, from a redneck, trigger-happy villain (Gary Sinise) to a cacophony of talking animals with one-liners on their mind, at least manage to be less annoying than in some films (cough, ``Madagascar").
Let's be clear : Personality-free Boog is no Yogi Bear, and even at its best, this mostly flavorless cartoon is only reaching for a bar that was set at toddler playground height. Boog's journey begins after a series of misunderstandings (including a minimart rampage that admirably declines endless opportunities for product placement), when he's banished from his coddled showbiz life in a remote small town and dropped into the high mountain forest a few days before the start of hunting season.
As Boog tries to make his way back ``home," he discovers his real place in the world with the help of his deer friend Elliot (Kutcher) and various other woodland creatures including shell-shocked ducks, sassy skunks, heckling beavers, and an army of fiery squirrels led by Billy Connolly.
It all leads up to a classic wilderness battle (flaming-marshmallow arrows, skunks used as stink bombs . . . you get the picture) in which predators become prey and vice versa. Even the littlest viewers should know exactly where this is going, every step of the way. That won't keep anyone from laughing, though.


         Is there such a thing as too much Ashton Kutcher? I don't know, I'm just asking. In one of those peculiar convergences of motion picture distribution, the actor has lead roles in not one but two of this week's major releases. Along with his action bow in "The Guardian," he costars opposite Martin Lawrence in the garrulously warm and wacky animated comedy "Open Season."
 
  Based on the comic strip "In the Bleachers" by former Times staffer Steve Moore, the movie is an amusing if slight excursion into nature with a group of animals who turn the tables on their collective nemeses, the hunters. "Open Season" screens in 3-D in selected Imax theaters, and that would be the most novel way to see this otherwise traditional foray into anthropomorphic humor.
 


         






    Lawrence is the voice of Boog, a laid-back grizzly bear who follows in the footsteps of animated ursine creatures that go back at least as far as Hanna-Barbera's Yogi Bear and Baloo from Disney's "The Jungle Book," not to mention a certain former Baltimore Orioles first baseman. Boog lives what he sees as the good life, performing in a campground nature show and sleeping in the garage of a kind-hearted ranger named Beth (Debra Messing), who each night tucks him in and sings "Teddy Bears' Picnic" to him. Enter Elliot (Kutcher), a klutzy, hyper mule deer, who is introduced — three days before hunting season — strapped to the hood of a truck belonging to Shaw (Gary Sinise), a wild-eyed hunter who looks as though he might hang out with crossbow enthusiast Ted Nugent.
 
  Boog rather innocently frees Elliot, who then attempts to pay him back by rescuing him from the domestic bliss afforded by the town of Timberline. Mayhem and misunderstanding ensue and Beth is forced to realize that it's time she released Boog, whom she raised from a cub, back to the wild.
 
  By now, open season has begun so Beth takes Boog high enough up the mountain to presumably be safe from the likes of Shaw. With Elliot as his running mate, however, that's not a sure thing. Boog does not adapt well to his new environment, butting heads with a gruff squirrel named McSquizzy, who speaks with the Scottish burr of Billy Connolly; a no-nonsense beaver named Reilly (Jon Favreau); a ubiquitous, multipurpose group of rabbits; and Elliot's nemesis, Ian (Patrick Warbuton), an alpha deer from his old herd.
 
  Boog quickly decides that the place for him is back in the security and comfort of Beth's garage. But the quickly descending hunters and the furry menagerie surrounding Boog conspire to make that easier said than done.
 
  Directed by Roger Allers ("The Lion King") and Pixar alumnus Jill Culton, "Open Season" is an amiable, fast-paced lark. Kutcher's wired screechiness riffs nicely alongside Lawrence's cool bass and a raft of well-cast supporting voices and rich visuals fill out the slender story.
 
  From the title sequence accompanied by Talking Heads' "Wild Wild Life" ("I'm wearin' fur pyjamas") through the slew of catchy songs from Paul Westerberg, the movie is a genial romp and because it relies on the gentlest of scatological comedy, it can be enjoyed by all ages.

Have you ever watched Ashton Kutcher boom through his Punk'd  intros and thought, That guy should hurry up and get himself a cartoon voice gig? He does cute, jacked-up work in Open Season  as a broken-antlered buck named Elliot, who helps Boog (Martin Lawrence), a house-trained grizzly banished to the forest, get back to his mountain town. Yet aside from Kutcher and the movie's comfy autumnal palette (its browny reds and light greens), the overfamiliar Open Season  feels like just another CG 'toon in our 'toon-glutted times.

 In the grand-scale animated comedy-adventure “Open Season,” periodic bursts of cleverness and eye-popping imagery, further enhanced in the 3-D Imax version, can’t disguise that this is just another movie full of jive-talking computer-generated  animals with little new to say.  Here, Boog (voiced by Martin Lawrence), a lovable and slightly dopey grizzly bear pampered by a kindly park ranger since cubhood, is set free in the wilderness just days before hunting season begins.  Tagging along is Elliot (Ashton Kutcher), the needy, motormouthed mule deer Boog rescues from the evil hunter Shaw (Gary Sinise). Elliot’s  mischievous ways are contagious. (Most disastrously  he gets Boog to help him ransack a convenience store while they’re both high on sugar.)  Despite some slow stretches, the usual morals  and the forgettable Paul Westerberg tunes, there are probably enough action-packed animal-versus-hunter battles and gross-out gags (very little time elapses between the mention, or appearance, of one bodily function or fluid and another) to keep the kiddies amused.  Adults won’t be so lucky. For best effect they should imagine that they’re watching a sequel to “Bambi,” and that Boog and Elliot’s oddball army of rabbits, beavers, skunks, squirrels, deer, a porcupine and a dachshund are taking revenge on the hunters responsible for the traumatic murder of Bambi’s mother. This bit of fantasy won’t necessarily make “Open Season,” the first feature from Sony Pictures Animation, an enjoyable experience,  but it might make it a slightly more satisfying one.  “Open Season” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some crude humor and generally playful animal abuse.

Though hardly the first animated film to tackle the plight of domesticated animals returning to the wild, "Open Season" is a witty, warmly crafted chestnut that reps a promising feature debut from Sony's upstart toon division. While the studio faces a significant marketing challenge in distinguishing its firstborn cub from the crowded field of CG critter pics, the generally winning combo of fuzzy sentiment and adult-friendly humor should hunt down strong family biz, with a boost from Imax 3-D playdates and big ancillary game.
At first glance, "Open Season" would seem to bear all the elements that have typified studio animation in recent years: a menagerie of fast-talking supporting players; generous dollops of bathroom humor; and animal-emo interludes set to incongruous pop songs (penned by Paul Westerberg, who also composed the film's score with Ramin Djawadi).
Fortunately, helmers Jill Culton and Roger Allers and co-helmer Anthony Stacchi demonstrate a surprisingly light touch with obvious material, achieving a comic rhythm that's zippy and droll rather than over-the-top manic and keeping the pop-culture references to a well-advised minimum. Even the scatological gags, though abundant and unavoidable (we are
 talking about a bear in the woods here), are for the most part refreshingly underplayed.
It's three days before the start of hunting season in the mountain village of Timberline, not that Boog (voiced by Martin Lawrence), a trained bear who's lived comfortably with forest ranger Beth (Debra Messing) since he was a cub, has anything to worry about -- or so he thinks. 
Boog meets and befriends Elliot (Ashton Kutcher), a mule deer with a big grin and a mischievous streak, who goads his new buddy into getting drunk on Slurpees and wreaking havoc at the local convenience store. Sadly realizing that the time has come for her oversized pet to return to its natural habitat, Beth transfers Boog (with Elliot in tow) by helicopter -- in a stirring, beautifully animated sequence -- to a remote forest clearing above a waterfall, where she imagines he'll be safe from the guns of encroaching hunters. 
Yet even as Boog and Elliot are stalked by the maniacally trigger-happy Shaw (a sinister Gary Sinise), Mother Nature turns out to have some hostile surprises of her own in store.
Screenplay by Steve Bencich, Ron J. Friedman and Nat Mauldin imagines the forest as the woodland equivalent of a school playground, where Boog and Elliot are routinely mocked and rejected by various critter cliques.
Lamentably, most of these groups are ethnically delineated: A squirrel named McSquizzy is voiced by Billy Connolly with a Scottish burr, the ducks quack in French accents, and Latina audiences probably won't appreciate being likened to ill-tempered skunks. Boog, too, has acquired a curious vocabulary, often muttering "my bad" and using "baby" as a term of endearment, though Lawrence's warm, affable characterization lifts the creature above stereotype.
Soon Boog's quest to return to civilization lands the entire forest population in hot water, culminating in a rousing battle between the hunters and the hunted, with some gentle lessons about friendship and teamwork. As a family-friendly fable about the necessity of relinquishing a wild animal, "Open Season" isn't exactly "Duma," but it delivers its eco-friendly message sweetly and without belaboring the point.
Pic also has an unusual wealth of character detail, using small but inspired visual touches to convey personality and emotion, from the single antler sported poignantly by Elliot to the teddy-bear knapsack Boog carts around as a tender reminder of his lost domicile. 
Animation is first-rate, not only in the finely detailed backdrops (which came across especially vividly in an Imax 3-D screening) and the obvious pains taken to convincingly render the animals' fur, but in the way throwaway jokes are smartly and subtly embedded at the edge of the frame, Pixar style. Rabbits, in particular, haven't been deployed this cutely and inventively since "Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit."
