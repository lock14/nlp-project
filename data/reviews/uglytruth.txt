It�s the same old story: An uptight professional woman finds love with her polar opposite, an earthy male chauvinist. The outcome is never in question in these Hollywood romantic comedies; it�s the getting there that makes the movie sparkle or not. Heigl and Butler prove to be no Hepburn and Tracy in this regard. The characters they play never spring genuinely to life. Any comic banter is dulled by Butler�s strained effort to swallow his Scottish brogue and deliver his lines in some kind of inscrutable American accent and Heigl�s halfhearted attempt to dial down her glamour quotient. Yet the actors are only the most visible aspects of this crassly conceived movie (even though Heigl also can boast a producing credit for The Ugly Truth
). The film seems calculated to be a �girls night out� picture with a racy �R� bite that includes plenty of profanity and faked orgasms. Its plotting (by newcomer Nicole Eastman and screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, who both scored much better with their scripts for Legally Blonde
, Ella Enchanted
, and The House Bunny
) is utterly predictable. Luketic�s direction is workmanlike at best; the staging underserves the story, the lighting washes out the characters, and the makeup does the actors no favors. Talented supporting actors (Hines and Higgins as bickering TV anchors and Connolly as a flummoxed dinner date) are criminally wasted and allowed no opportunity for their comic spontaneity to erupt. Heigl plays Abby Richter, the producer of a failing morning TV show in Sacramento, who is forced to accept the inclusion of ratings-magnet Mike Chadway (Butler) into her morning mix. Mike is hired to bring his cable access show, The Ugly Truth
, to greater Sacramento. The show is his forum for pronouncing what he perceives to be the ugly truth about the age-old battle of the sexes (boiled down, essentially, to Men: untamable Tarzans; Women: Janes who need to go native if they want to snare a man). Abby hates his philosophy but seeks his help anyway in snagging the bachelor doctor (Winter) who lives across the way. This leads to shopping trips, lessons in how to sexily devour a hot dog, and some remote-controlled vibrating underpants that are the underpinnings for the movie�s signature set-piece (attempting to rival When Harry Met Sally �
 for displays of orgasms in public restaurants but falling far short of that mark). Taken as a whole, The Ugly Truth
 is much like its orgasms: phony and unsatisfying.

Like most women in movies right now, Katherine Heigl was born in the wrong  decade.  She has the misfortune to work in a time when her business values women either as something else for the camera to do (apparently Megan Fox is all the transformer certain men need) or as a device to confuse gaydars. Sixty years ago, she might have been a biggish deal in minor comedies, the way she is now. But she might also have had taller, more charismatic men to  star with and better things to be and represent than she does at the start of the 21st century, where she’s stuck playing professionally capable, socially retarded women.

Heigl plies her trade in so-called chick flicks, the Lean Cuisine of romantic comedy, and her latest contribution, “The Ugly Truth’’  - or, as I fondly came to think of it, the Baja-style chicken quesadilla (only five Weight Watchers points!)  - casts her as an undersexed television news producer named Abby Richter. This is a promotion from being an aspiring TV personality (“Knocked Up’’) and a smitten eco-magazine drone (“27 Dresses’’).

Why is Abby undersexed? Not simply because she’s overworked (she loves her job), but because she’s so good at what she does that she does it during dates. For one rendezvous with Kevin Connolly, of “Entourage,’’ she arrives armed with a background check, talking points, and a checklist of desired personality traits: likes red wine and classical music, has a symmetrical face, never gets up first on a Sunday morning (whatever that means).

This is not a woman. This is a walking Facebook profile.

Thank goodness her Sacramento morning show has just brought in Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler), a barking chauvinist, to lift the ratings and, consequently, educate Abby on how to conduct herself with the boringly handsome surgeon neighbor (Eric Winter) she’s just started seeing. She produces Mike’s segments. He produces her dates. Even though there’s no reason for Abby, with her principles and integrity, to like this (admittedly appealing) lout, little time is wasted foreshadowing the love Jacuzzi that awaits them.

The people responsible for “The Ugly Truth’’  -  director Robert Luketic and  screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith, sharing a credit with Nicole Eastman  - were also responsible for “Legally Blonde.’’ That must have been a once-in-a-lifetime thing since this new movie is only half as entertaining as the other one. Abby is not a terribly surprising or dynamic character. She’s a cliché. In “Legally Blonde,’’ Elle Woods’s dumbness was a neat rubber toy  - pull on it, and it snaps. Abby’s intelligence is like stale Play-Doh. No one’s building a Broadway musical around that. Her sense of fun is doused with professionalism.
In name only, “The Ugly Truth’’ echoes Leo McCarey’s exuberantly well-oiled 1937 screwball comedy “The Awful Truth,’’ with Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, as a divorcing couple who are still in love despite themselves. (Although Eric Winter is as perfect a hapless stooge as Ralph Bellamy in McCarey’s movie.)

Otherwise, “The Ugly Truth’’ draws from a different well. Many women in romantic comedies in the last few years have been modeled on either Liz Lemon from NBC’s “30 Rock,’’ Sally Albright from “When Harry Met Sally,’’ or Jane Craig in “Broadcast News,’’ three of the most important female TV or movie comedy characters in the last two-and-a-half decades.

Abby has a combination of their professional seriousness and their high-strung temperament. But those women are funny, true, and humanly neurotic.  The screenwriters  picked over their obvious traits (Liz’s unlimited capacity for humiliation, Sally’s finicky ways, Jane’s prickly righteousness) without attaching anything emotional to them. It’s hard to see any of those women climbing a tree to fetch a cat only to fall out of it and into a man’s crotch. Abby does that.

The movie has embarrassingly limited ideas about both the sexes and sex. Like Sandra Bullock’s career woman in “The Proposal,’’ Abby appears to have never heard of intercourse, much less  experienced it.

“The Ugly Truth’’ does stand admirably by its R rating. All the best dialogue is unprintable (so is most of the worst), and a pair of vibrating panties affords Abby the opportunity to loosen up in a manner that would put a smile on Sally Albright’s face.

Heigl and Butler make more sense together than most of their peers. He has creases in his face and a swashbuckling, unapologetic manliness that suits romantic comedies, since they’re about taming wild impulses. It’s fun watching the genre’s corset squeeze in on him.

And yet it’s unfair that Heigl is laced up from the start. Her most believable moments come when she’s in complete control over her seductive powers. That happens twice, and on both occasions, the joke is that she’s faking it. American movies continue to damn the control freak for not being a super freak, and the super freak for having no control. I’ll marry the filmmaker who gives us a complete woman who splits the difference.

Back in the days of Bogart and Bergman, Hepburn and Tracy, it was said that people learned how to fall in love  how to kiss, beguile, or just hold hands  by watching the people in the movies. Today, anyone eager for tips on how to find, and woo, the perfect mate hardly needs to look to Hollywood. Amorous instruction is everywhere  on reality shows; in hipper-than-thou men's and women's magazines; in music videos and stand-up comedy; in ruthless-as-you-gotta-be advice bibles like The Rules  (guys are dogs who must be tamed!) and The Game  (girls are princesses who must be knocked down!); in that big pink Sex and the City  boxed set; in the endless massed shelves of chick lit...
Given all that, it's hardly a surprise to see a romantic comedy in which the two main characters aren't so much human beings as walking, talking extremes of he said/she said psychobabble. In The Ugly Truth , Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler), a ranting Neanderthal philosopher-lout, rises out of the swamp of public-access TV to land a segment, titled ''The Ugly Truth,'' on a local news show in Sacramento. Mike's idea of how to make a relationship work sounds like the braying of Andrew Dice Clay spiced with the hormonal sensitivity of Joe (Girls Gone Wild ) Francis. He thinks that men want women to look hot and act hotter, and that women who think they're meant to do anything more are delusional. When Mike, on his new TV gig, leaps into a vat of Jell-O with a pair of wrestling bimbos, it's not because he doesn't believe in  romance  it's because he thinks that's all romance is.
Mike's producer, Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl), finds Mike and his stripper-pole view of the world abhorrent (as well she should). That, of course, is because she's  his opposite number, a control-freak prude who treats her prospective boyfriends as job applicants. She's also obsessed with ''class'' (you know, bistros and galleries). As Mike and Abby bicker and claw, they sound like dueling magazines: When Maxim Met Cosmo . But then, assuming that you've spun past the implausible notion that a local news station would ever hire a horndog firecracker like Mike (or that the viewers would give  him a 93 percent positive rating), a second contrivance kicks in: He tries to win Abby over by coaching her on tactics to nail her  latest prospect (eat hot dogs suggestively!), even giving her a makeover (more jiggle, shorter skirts). At around this point, the movie turns into When Clueless Met Porky's . Seriously, can you feel the love?
The Ugly Truth  was directed by Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde ), from a script by Nicole Eastman and the team of Kirsten Smith and Karen McCullah Lutz, the duo who wrote Legally Blonde  and The House Bunny . Perhaps because it's less stylized than those films, The Ugly Truth  isn't fizzy and fun  it's vacuously snappy. Butler, the gruffly bearded Scottish-born hunk, hasn't done much since leading the Spartans in the semi-digitized war epic 300  (2007); this is the first chance anyone who didn't catch RocknRolla  or P.S. I Love You  has had to see what he's like in an ''ordinary'' role. To judge from The Ugly Truth , I'd say he's a potato-faced Russell Crowe with a lot less charm. Butler has a jovial twinkle, but because he's working so hard to nail an American accent, he doesn't so much enunciate his words as masticate them. He tears into every scene as if he were devouring a 20-ounce steak.
Heigl, who has mastered the art of acting insecure in order to make her porcelain- doll sexiness seem more offhand, has energy problems of her own. She's not just nervous, she's skittish; she can't relax for long enough to let the audience fall for her. She and Butler certainly generate sexual chemistry: They're both so tightly wired, and attractive in such outsize opposite ways (When Gladiator Met Barbie ? Okay, I'll stop), that when they kiss on an elevator, they look as if they can hardly wait to go to bed. But does that mean they're right for each other? Or just ripe for an   empty hot fling? Mike thinks that a ''refined'' woman like Abby needs a caveman to shake her up. He also thinks that's a finger in the eye of conventional wisdom. The ugly truth is that it's the ultimate chick-flick cliché.


 That tap-tap-tapping sound you hear is another nail being driven into the coffin of the romantic comedy. Over the years this sturdy if supple genre has survived extraordinary cultural and social changes, most notably the suffragist movement in the early part of the last century and women’s rights toward the latter. Liberated women, along with the pill, quickie divorces, swinging couples, blended families and various wars both abroad and at home might have dinged the genre, but it has endured and adapted, even when the story now hinges on boy meets boy meets boy (as in “Shortbus”)  or pops up on the small screen (“Sex and the City”).  When it comes to the old straight-boy-meets-straight-girl configuration with big-studio production values, however, you might as well forget it, at least if you’re a woman. Outside of Judd Apatow, who has carved out a niche and inspired something of a subgenre with movies about funny, smutty but sincere man-boys puzzling their way through adult heterosexual relations, the romantic comedy is nearly as dead as Meg Ryan’s career. In the best of these films, the women aren’t romantic foils, much less equals: they’re either (nice) sluts or (nicer) wives, and essentially as mysterious and unknowable as the dark side of the moon. In the most calculating (“The Hangover”), they are strippers with hearts and racks of gold or emasculating shrews.  Which leads to “The Ugly Truth,” a cynical, clumsy, aptly titled attempt to cross the female-oriented romantic comedy with the male-oriented gross-out comedy that is interesting on several levels, none having to do with cinema. Katherine Heigl plays Abby, a producer for a ratings-challenged Sacramento morning television show, the kind that specializes in empty smiles, cooking tips and weather updates. She’s single and therefore, in the moral economy of modern Hollywood, unhappy. Her life goes into a tailspin when her boss hires a professional ape, Mike (Gerard Butler), who delivers loutish maxims on camera about the sexes that basically all boil down to this: Men have penises,  and women should accommodate them any which way they can, preferably in push-up bras and remote-controlled vibrating panties.  The two leads, bathed in an otherworldly golden light that makes their skin look honey-roasted and turns their teeth into beacons, look tasty indeed, almost finger-lickin’ good. Ms. Heigl doesn’t do perky all that persuasively, but she does keep her smile and relative dignity even in scenes in which Abby is forced to play the fool, which is often, as when she’s hanging upside down from a tree in her skivvies. She even survives the scene that finds Abby writhing spasmodically during a dinner with her corporate masters, because, well, she’s wearing those pulsating panties, the boy at the next table has the remote, and there’s nothing funnier (or, really, scarier) than the spectacle of female pleasure. Well, it worked in “When Harry Met Sally.”  The director, Robert Luketic,  who did far better with “Legally Blonde,” appears to have instructed his actors to (over)play their roles for the hard of seeing and hard of hearing, resulting in across-the-board loud line readings, mugging faces and flopping (clothed) body parts. Mr. Butler, an appealing screen presence who needs better roles or savvier career counseling, does his grinning best with a charmless, unbelievable character who of course is hiding a wounded heart under his leathery man hide. (The first tip-off: Mike provides babe advice to his young nephew, an ape in training.) The fantasy of the redeemable, even lovable cad is a favorite romantic fantasy, one that the writers Nicole Eastman, Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith peddle shamelessly.  That three women thought up this junk should be no more surprising than the fact that the movie is being released by Columbia Pictures, which is overseen by Amy Pascal, the co-chairwoman of Sony Pictures Entertainment. One of the lessons of “The Ugly Truth” — beyond the obvious one that a desirable, desiring woman can never, ever, be happily single and sexual in modern Hollywood — is that holding to your hard-won ideals is of no consequence, at least when there’s a guy to be hooked. When Mike is brought in, Abby fights him because she sees him for what he is: the lowest common denominator. Eventually, though, she succumbs to his coarse ways, even adopting his crude language, because, well, that’s what the public wants.  Isn’t that right, Ms. Pascal?    “The Ugly Truth” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The language is consistently crude and includes the apparently now requisite antigay slurs.

"The Ugly Truth" is an arch, contrived, entirely predictable romantic comedy assembled with sufficient audience-friendly elements to put it over as both a good girls' night attraction and a date-night lure raunchy enough to leave couples in the right mood afterward. As such, and with the easy-to-watch Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler as cat and dog who initially hate each other so much that love is the only possible result, Sony should expect to reap some far-from-ugly midsummer B.O. returns from this commercially calculated cocktail.
Trying like mad to lay claim to a secure place in the sparsely populated realm of bankable, comedically oriented leading ladies, Heigl rather overplays her hand here as a beauteous control freak who's so domineering with dates she needs advice from a man's man on how to get laid. It's an odd, far-fetched twist on the Pygmalion story, with the modern angle of poking holes in political correctness, one that might have been made marginally convincing by a dollop of backstory or psychology that pretended to explain the woman's cluelessness with guys.
As it is, the strenuous outrage exhibited by Heigl's TV producer, Abby Richter, at being forced to work with Butler's macho-pig shock jock, Mike Chadway, registers as cartoonish overreaction. Faced with dwindling ratings for her Sacramento-based morning show, Abby is saddled with the outwardly rude and crude Chadway when a guest shot by the hitherto obscure public-access TV host provokes strong audience reaction to his rants about how women have to accept the male species' basic caveman nature.
Bossy and indomitable at work, Abby misguidedly applies those same attributes to her personal life, which means she has none. When she falls (literally, from a tree) into the life of dreamboat neighbor Colin (Eric Winter), she dithers so terribly that she accepts help from Mike, who guarantees that, if she follows his advice to the letter, she'll snag her man. 
You'd think a woman who looks like Heigl wouldn't need to do anything to attract male attention but, then again, in "Knocked Up," she resorted to a tryst with the then-grubby Seth Rogen, so perhaps screenwriters Nicole Eastman (a first-timer) and Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith ("Legally Blonde") know better. In the event, Mike supervises Abby's makeover via a shopping spree and new haircut, followed by a ballgame date at which Mike, like a modern Cyrano, instructs Abby over an earphone what to do and say to Colin, with mildly disastrous results.
Mike prepares his charge for a subsequent date with a gift of some vibrator-equipped undies, resulting in another would-be hilarious setpiece in which Abby becomes inadvertently vibrated during a very public business dinner. A director truly adept at carefully constructed slow-burn comedy and a star with disciplined comic gifts could have had a field day with such a scene, but what helmer Robert Luketic serves up feels more like a rehearsal than the polished gem it could have been; Heigl doesn't even break a sweat.
Wrap-up is inevitable but needlessly hokey and undercut by awfully artificial process photography and visual effects, and a cloying musical score. 
Handicapped by flat makeup, plastered-down hair and overly bright lighting, Heigl doesn't look too great at the outset, which may or may not have been intentional given the storyline. But beyond what the script calls for, the thesp comes off as strident and overbearing; she overemphasizes everything in a way that suggests every beat was thought out, leaving little room for comic spontaneity. As cracks in Abby's self-assurance show themselves and the character relaxes to Mike's natural charm, Heigl's appeal emerges, but she might advisedly seek projects with more heart.
Butler gives Mike an affable, lived-in quality that quickly takes the edge off the character's deliberate abrasiveness and encourages the viewer to imagine he's had abundant and varied life experience. Supporting turns are highly caricatured.
