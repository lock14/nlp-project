Director Roth has accomplished the near impossible with Hostel: Part II
: He's crafted a vastly superior sequel to a film already considered something of a classic by genre aficionados, one that supersedes its predecessor's sadistic entertainment quotient by orders of magnitude while also upstaging its own outrageous gore effects with a script that's smart, vicious, and occasionally, gleefully subversive. Hostel: Part II
 will kick your ass, blow your mind, and then mount you with a rusty, barbed-wire strap-on, and to hell with the Astroglide. The first film followed a pair of randy American twentysomethings to Europe where, instead of finding the promised land of girls gone wild and copious copulation, they ended up lured into a series of very bad ends in the former Eastern bloc country of Slovakia. The original and this sequel are both cunningly updated riffs on The Most Dangerous Game
, with wealthy, usually Western men of means blowing their Christmas bonuses on the chance to slaughter helpless tourists in the anonymous safety of some abandoned Bratislavan backwater. Hostel: Part II
 ups the ante in every department. Instead of libidinous American machismo running amok, Roth has cast a female trio: Philips, German, and Welcome to the Dollhouse
's Matarazzo, whose character suffers a fate even worse than that of Dollhouse
's Dawn Wiener. More important, the script gives equal time to the bad guys (Bart and Burgi). The banality of evil, and the lengths to which such white-bread power brokers go to shore up their flagging egos, is a terrifying conceit that makes perfect, creepy sense. It's an ambitious film, and, despite the over-the-top subject matter, it borders (very loosely) on the Hitchcockian in terms of incongruous yuks amidst all the ick. It's not for every taste, and it's unlikely the cultural arbiter the Rev. James Dobson and his Focus on the Family gang will want to focus on anything other than pillorying Roth for what I suspect they'll regard as his part in the downfall of "traditional" family values. (In all honesty, though, I'm hoping for a Fox News-televised "flay-off" between Dobson and Roth, � la Uwe Boll's money-where-your-teeth-used-to-be boxing challenge, the most inspired critical sucker punch of 2006. Just as long as they keep it fair and balanced and, um, flensy.) But, really, where else can you see the cameoing horror director Ruggero Deodato (Cannibal Holocaust
) in such an � ahem � meaty role? Social commentary, gore galore, and a truly disturbing denouement: This is Roth's best nightmare yet. (See p.58 of this week's Screens section for an interview with Eli Roth, who was in Austin last week to present a sneak preview.)



At about the 47th minute of "Hostel: Part II" Heather Matarazzo is hanging upside down and naked from the high ceiling of a very old dungeon. Her mouth is gagged, but her grunts, cries, and squeals are unmistakable.
A woman enters the room, removes her robe, and slips into the tub, right beneath the younger woman dangling above her. She raises up a scythe and proceeds to draw herself a blood bath. We can see the woman in the tub covered in red. We can see her writhe in ecstasy. We can see that there is no proper way to enjoy Eli Roth's movie, another tale of doomed American tourists captured in Slovakia and fed to international weirdos with a torture fetish and money to burn.
Until Matarazzo's despicable exit, the movie had been watchable -- entertaining, even, thanks in part to the performances of Lauren German and Bijou Phillips, who play prettier, more outgoing girls touring Europe with her. That death sequence, though, forces you to wonder what's on the mind of a writer-director who'd give us such a collection of images. "Hostel Part II" is a movie about sex fantasies that itself is a sex fantasy, no?
Roth appears to like it rough, and the assumption is that we do , too. But where is the pleasure in seeing a buzz saw to the face? Or watching genitals being thrown to a pair of dogs -- even if the man who owned them deserves to be punished? The movie's moral center doesn't hold, which might be the point: Slaughter feels good, whether you're paying to kill or brutalizing your would-be killer.
But this is not an allegory. I, at least, won't drag into this the war or Gitmo or our ongoing fascination with the voyeurism of torture. Roth's aim is simple. He just wants to surpass the bounds of what a movie can show -- what he showed in the first "Hostel" -- and how long the camera can linger over it. The sequel has the male frontal nudity to prove it.
Like too many horror films, "Hostel: Part II" equates guts with glory. Roth might have chutzpah, but, sadly he doesn't have any interest in actually scaring us. The moviemaking is driven only by contempt; he wants to nauseate us into submission.
In this spring's "Grindhouse," Roth demonstrated he had a sense of humor to go with his sense of sadism, producing an extremely extreme fake trailer that appeared between the feature attractions. But it's the one-word title of another "Grindhouse" trailer that seems appropriate for Roth's future adventures in transgression: "Don't."

         To say that "Hostel: Part II," as with its predecessor, isn't everybody's flagon of grog is understating matters in the extreme. Those who would rather eat day-old garbage than watch even the most obnoxious of our nation's youth senselessly and elaborately butchered may as well stop reading here and go on with their lives. Those with stronger constitutions and more open minds may already know that this isn't just any bloody horror show.
 
 The first "Hostel," which slithered its way into the zeitgeist of horror cinema early last year, injected satire on Bush-era American pleasure principles into its savage story line of young American backpackers lured into libidinous indulgences only to be tortured, maimed and killed by wealthy sickos.
 


         






   The easiest thing for writer-director Eli Roth to do after making such a big splash would have been to serve up bigger helpings of raw entrails and shattered bones. He does. But he also does something more cunning — and more distressing. He widens his view to take in not just the slaughter, but the motives behind it; to poke at the monstrous impulses asleep within so-called rational minds.
 
 So after "Hostel II" ties up loose ends from the previous installment, it quickly moves on to the next set of prospective victims: Beth (Lauren German), a self-possessed rich girl; Whitney (Bijou Phillips), a tawny smart-aleck; and Lorna (Heather Matarazzo from "Welcome to the Dollhouse"), a nerdy romantic. They're all enticed to leave their Roman holiday by a statuesque model (Vera Jordanova) who says there's this neat little town outside  Prague that's just so much fun, you'll never leave. Um, yeah.
 
 Roth's also tending a story line about their potential murderers: Todd (Richard Burgi from "Desperate Housewives"), a swaggering Type-A drip who persuades his drippier friend Stuart (Roger Bart) to come along for recreational slaughter. Todd thinks such a vacation can only help hone their edges in the corporate world. Stuart isn't so sure, especially when the game requires getting tattooed. He hates needles.
 
 One could say that, through this concurrent narrative, Roth is forcing gore hounds to examine their motives for getting off on such grisly exhibition. But "Hostel II" is far too shrewd and savagely witty to be caught engaging in higher seriousness. Roth could probably go even further with this particular franchise if he wanted to.
 
 Yet somehow, I think he's meant for grander, subtler and more intricate distractions than this.
 
 "Hostel Part II." MPAA rating: R for sadistic scenes of torture and bloody violence, terror, nudity, sexual content, language and some drug content. Running time: 1 hour, 34 minutes. In general release.   

 Benefiting from a higher budget, Eli Roth’s follow-up to his generally odious “Hostel” may sport glossier production values, but its driving motivation — to push the boundaries of exploitative nastiness — remains just as low.  Wasting less time than its predecessor, “Hostel: Part II” plunges right in, with the predictably hasty disposal of Paxton (Jay Hernandez), the first movie’s sole survivor, before shifting focus to a trio of American female students (Lauren German, Heather Matarazzo and Bijou Phillips), who are only fractionally more tolerable than the moronic frat boys of Part 1.  Lured to Slovakia with the promise of a first-class spa experience, the girls instead become the prisoners of the rich and twisted who electronically bid big bucks — call it eSlay — to brutalize and butcher kidnapped young tourists. The inner workings of this torture factory and its clients, whose ultra-secrecy generated the little suspense found in the original, are now freely revealed.  Mr. Roth, part of a new breed of horror directors affectionately labeled the “Splat Pack,” is regarded by some as a savior of the genre, though it could be argued that he is more effectively a saboteur. He might have mastered the cheap sadism-as-entertainment gross-out, but he has yet to produce a single genuine, old-fashioned fright.  Rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for explicit torture, carnage, nudity, sexual content, language and general nastiness.

Gorehound Eli Roth reasserts his position as leader of the "splat pack," an unofficial fraternity of directors dedicated to topping one another's stomach-churning antics, with "Hostel: Part II." His ultra-grisly pics may be an acquired taste, but Roth seems more than happy to feed auds' appetites for hardcore horror, taking three European tourists on a detour through his Slovak killing factory. In this twist-filled sequel, the real shocker is just how smart and satisfying such degradation can be. There's no question "Part II" outgrosses the original "Hostel" in the blood-and-guts department, and savvy spin should do the same financially.
Roth is no dummy, and he's learned from the press surrounding the original "Hostel" (or was it the fan-driven messsage boards?) just what auds want. For starters, it's the ladies who drive horror-movie ticket sales, dragging their male dates along, not the other way around. So in a gesture of equal-opportunity exploitation, Roth switches the gender of his victims and injects a fair amount of full-frontal male nudity. 
And where "Hostel" followed three American tourists so abrasive auds wouldn't really mind seeing them tortured beyond recognition, "Part II's" central trio come across as reasonably sympathetic. There's Beth (Lauren German), a trust-fund case so rich she keeps her father on allowance. "She could pretty much buy Slovakia if she wanted to," explains wild-child Whitney (Bijou Phillips), who rides her friend's coattails through Europe, flirting with every dangerous stranger she meets along the way.The two girls also invite socially awkward Lorna to join, with actress Heather Matarazzo delivering a performance even more courageously pitiful than the "Welcome to the Dollhouse" turn that launched her career.
All three actresses are horror vets, and pro enough to make auds feel invested in their fates. That said, what makes "Hostel: Part II" so subversive is that Roth shifts the focus to the perpetrators, a network of international businessmen who pay top dollar for the chance to snuff wayward backpackers in whatever fashion they please. Stanley Kubrick would have approved of Roth's Elite Hunting operation, and the "Hostel" sequel stands as the "Eyes Wide Shut" of horror movies.
Where the original preyed on relatively mundane fears of traveling abroad, "Part II" plunges much deeper, raising horrifying questions about what the average mild-mannered husband might be doing with the family savings.
Instead of concentrating on just one sadist, sequel broadens the network to include the world's rich and powerful, daring to suggest that, given the motivation and the means, each of us might find some sliver of that murderous impulse within ourselves. There's some truth to the idea, at least insofar as auds derive any satisfaction from watching these heinous crimes enacted for their entertainment onscreen (the disappointment is palpable when a character obscures one death from view). Roth's indictment doesn't extend to everyone, but "Hostel" auds are a pretty self-selecting bunch -- given Lionsgate's unusually graphic advertising campaign, no one stumbles into a movie like this unawares.
Pic shadows two customers in particular, a big-talk tycoon (Richard Burgi) and a browbeaten househusband (Roger Bart), with their own macabre motives for joining the killers' club. By letting auds' into their world, "Hostel: Part II" answers the obvious question left open by the original: Who exactly are these people who pay to torture perfect strangers? Pic also introduces Sasha (Milan Knazko), the cold-blooded mastermind who oversees the entire operation, who could emerge as a recurring villain of future sequels.
The gore, it would seem, is almost incidental. A larger budget and strong below-the-line support allow Roth's imagination to run wild (one ghastly scenario no viewer will soon forget features a sickle-wielding witch who pays to bathe in virgin blood), and makeup masters Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger have risen to the challenge. As gruesome as their creations can appear, a twisted sense of humor underlies the entire operation, as if sheer outrageousness might offset the effects' startling realism.
Indeed, the only way to watch is to suspend any literal-minded analysis and appreciate Roth's Grand Guignol sensibilities on their own level. Could Roth have accomplished the same thing without introducing such patently offensive imagery into the world? Absolutely, but then he wouldn't have bested the recent efforts of his peers, who keep upping the ante with pics like "High Tension" and "Saw." Nor would he have involved us so thoroughly in the action that we're complicit in the pic's incredibly satisfying climax. There are no innocents here -- least of all the audience.

Eli Roth  is obviously a poseur, but on the evidence of Hostel: Part II , he's also kind of a pussy. Anyone can string a naked woman up by the ankles and slit her throat, and while I admit it takes a little extra something to position a Eurotrash villainess beneath her flayed torso, then gawk at the sight of her rubbing blood all over her tits, that hardly qualifies as a bold new genre vision. The Splat Pack bad boy imagines he's raising the bar on horror when in fact he isn't making horror movies at all. Like the fake trailer for Thanksgiving , his amusingly skuzzy contribution to Grindhouse , the sequel to Roth's vile hit Hostel  is a riff on shock, a meta-movie lark. It's too goofy to disturb, too silly to scare, closer in spirit (if not in skill) to the cartoon yucks of Evil Dead II  than the transgressive classics it so desperately tries to trump.
Blame (but don't believe) the hype. Repulsed by Roth's fanboy fever to up the ante on sex and violence, commentator Nikki Finke  greeted the news of a high-quality H2  bootleg with glee. "Lionsgate deserves to feel the effects of piracy (not to mention the wrath of mankind) for distributing such a disgusting film," she boldly opined. Over at The Hot Blog, David Poland  popped a hot disc in his player and promptly exploded in a moralistic hissy fit. "I watched a scene that was the most disgusting, degrading, misogynistic, soulless shit I have ever seen in a movie that is going to be released widely in this country," he wrote. Currently there are 33,000 words of reader commentary posted in response to his rant.
So here I am expecting the motherfucking Sacre du Printemps  of slasher flicks, and I end up with a passably made gorefest considerably less brutalizing than my rush hour subway ride to the Times Square  premiere.
Routinely plotted and predictable in its ironies, H2  duplicates the original scenario but flips the gender. So long, frat boys--it's ladies night! The meat puppets include Lauren German  as the nice girl with a trust fund, Bijou Phillips  as the slut, and Heather Matarazzo  as the dork. En route to Prague , they're lured by yet another crypto-lesbo (Vera Jordanova ) into a Slovakian snuff club where high rolling psychopaths bid top dollar for the pleasure of killing. In what passes for innovation here, Roger Bart  and Richard Burgi  co-star as clients in a subplot that follows their murderous preparations, complete with homoerotic undercurrents and cornball alpha male psychodrama.
Going behind the scenes of the death club, Roth invents the hilariously nefarious mastermind Sasha (Milan Knazko ), a haute-Euro boogeyman with tacky taste in tchotchkes, a ball-breaking henchwoman, and two big, droopy bloodhounds. The effect is pure Blofeld. Indeed, the bigger budget has aggrandized Hostel 's sleazy abattoir-chic toward a James Bond  camp of production design. Beginning with the handsome, candle-lit dungeon spa, the torture sequences advance to the velvety dining parlor of a cannibalistic aesthete who munches on the thigh sashimi of a strapping (and strapped down) young lad. Meanwhile, across the hall, a plump, faggoty hairdresser grooms the girls for their customers in a well-appointed dressing room.
And the violence? Very nasty indeed, if neutered by Roth's pathetic desperation to shock. The most disturbing thing about this implausibly R-rated spectacle is what it says about the double standard of the MPAA . Apparently, you can linger over a cock in close-up so long as it's being cut in half by a pair of scissors. Getting an audience to whoop in pleasure at graphic castration is less an expression of some twisted feminist agenda, as our disingenuous auteur would have us believe, than a dirty little YouTube stunt writ large.
Ends up there is a moral to the story, one sure to delight the bamboozled pseudo-intellectuals who laughably defended Hostel  as a geo-political critique of American arrogance and the culture of torture. Having survived her ordeal in classic Final Girl style, our mega-rich heroine simply buys her way to freedom. Eli Roth punks capitalism all the way to the bank with cheap tricks and bankrupt imagination.
