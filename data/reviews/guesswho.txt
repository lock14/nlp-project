Percy Jones (Mac) and his wife, Marilyn (Scott), are about to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary by throwing a party and renewing their vows, but little do they know they are about to be punk'd by Ashton Kutcher in the role of Simon Green, the boyfriend of their daughter Theresa (Saldana), who has every intention of promoting Simon to the job of son-in-law. Guess Who
 is a contemporary takeoff on the Stanley Kramer classic of socially relevant filmmaking Guess Who's Coming to Dinner
. It states the painfully obvious to say that Kutcher is no Sidney Poitier, nor are the other players on par with Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. Even though the thought of such dubious replacements is sure to offend the film purists, these naysayers are not likely to make up strong contingents of the Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac fan base. And that's who this movie is seeking to lure. Although the movie's twist is the introduction of a white suitor into a family of African-Americans, the movie is more geared to Meet the Parents
-style humor than social relevance. It's telling that Kutcher and Saldana have zero chemistry as a loving couple, which makes it kind of difficult to honestly root for them to overcome their troubles in paradise. The main attraction in Guess Who
 is between Mac and Kutcher, who fitfully bond, � la De Niro and Stiller, but with racial jokes added to the mix. Mac exudes a professionalism that carries him through every scene, even when racing with his future son-in-law in go-karts. On the other hand, Kutcher seems out of place in this comedy: He's too buttoned-down to have much personality at all. The makers of Guess Who
 appear to have given more thought to targeting an audience than building a believable movie. Yet director Sullivan, a TV veteran, manages to keep some of the racial humor barbed and well-focused, giving Guess Who
 a slightly transgressive feel in its best moments. The film will not win any peace awards, but it is more palatable than its preview trailers make it out to be.


On its surface, the muddled new ''Guess Who" is a love story between Theresa (Zoë Saldana) and Simon (Ashton Kutcher). She is black. He is not. This is not important to them. But the movie needs something to do for 100 minutes, so it concocts a lot of harebrained physical comedy.
Theresa takes Simon home to suburban New Jersey to meet her parents, who are renewing their vows, and to announce their engagement. Her mother, Marilyn Jones (Judith Scott), is fine. It's her father, Percy (Bernie Mac), who takes the news as a betrayal.
He's so ashamed of his future son-in-law that he tells an underling at work that Theresa's boyfriend is a Howard-educated basketball player named Jamal. Yet Percy's love of the overwhelmingly white world of NASCAR is a fascinating paradox that the movie never calls him on. The framed photos of Jeff Gordon in his home are there chiefly as sight gags.
''Guess Who" might be an update of Stanley Kramer's well-intentioned 1967 ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." In that film, white Katharine Houghton brings black Sidney Poitier home to her white parents (Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn). Tears are shed and lessons are imparted; sap and righteousness rule.
Nothing in the new movie's press notes mentions the old one. The races are reversed, and the sermons have been replaced with slapstick. This puts ''Guess Who" in closer company with ''Meet the Parents," as the clumsy, gangly, and inappropriate Kutcher does his shtick and the proud and unflappable Mac does his.
The movie will please those looking for easy physical comedy. Percy doesn't want Simon in his home, but after things don't work out with relocating him to a hotel, the disgruntled father sends the prospective son-in-law to his basement den and shares the foldout bed with him in case his little girl sneaks down for sex.
And those looking for extraneous plot entanglements will be thrilled to discover that the screenplay has plenty. For instance, when Simon quits his high-earning finance job and needs to borrow money, it's Percy who just happens to be a loan officer.
But if you're looking for a meaningful consideration of the intricacies that come with introducing your white boyfriend to your black family, you're probably eating nachos at the wrong multiplex. ''Guess Who" is glib in the same way that ''Meet the Parents" was.
We already know Percy is stubborn, but Mrs. Jones remains too preoccupied with learning the tango for their re-wedding ceremony to talk seriously with her daughter or to reason with her husband.
Ultimately, Percy doesn't care that Simon is white. He cares that Simon is a man who wants to take his daughter away. But since the movie begins as a comedy about race, it has to stay there. So just as Robert De Niro did to Jewish Ben Stiller, Mac taunts Kutcher into trouble, as in a scene where Simon is bullied into telling racist jokes at dinner.
It's like racial Russian roulette: Simon has to keep them coming until he inevitably crosses the line. The moment is interesting as a social experiment (how much racism can a person tolerate until he snaps?), but it's terrible as comedy: The Joneses look stupid cracking up at Simon's jokes, then getting mad at them.
Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan seems unsure about how to play all this. So he goes for a little of everything. There are moments of silly horseplay between Mac and Kutcher, ill-advised farce like that dinner sequence, and general embarrassment, such as when Theresa's randy slacker sister (Kellee Stewart) wants to know if ''it's true what they say" about white guys. Once in a while ''Guess Who" settles into a calm tone with such warmth and ease that it grows harder to tolerate the shenanigans.
Each of these warmer moments involves the story's women, especially Saldana, who steals the movie with her sharpness and exuberance, standing up to Mac and rolling her eyes at Kutcher. She's ravishing.
Watching ''Guess Who," I didn't always know what Theresa saw in Simon and why she tolerated her dad's parochialism. The only thing that truly makes sense here is what they see in her.


         The press kit for the film "Guess Who" is a faux leather-bound family photo album featuring a shot of stars Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac uneasily seated at opposite ends of a yellow couch. When you open the kit, Mac slides menacingly to his left until he's elbow-to-elbow with the cowering Kutcher.
 
  Unfortunately, that may be the most clever thing about this innocuous comedy, titled to suggest Stanley Kramer's 1967 melodrama, "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner," which starred Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier and Katharine Hepburn in what was then considered a daring look at interracial coupling.
 


         






    "Guess Who" reverses the roles, with Mac serving as the concerned father awaiting the arrival of his daughter's new beau; Kutcher plays the Poitier part. However, the film feels more like a remake of the 1970s TV sitcom "The Jeffersons" — minus its caustic wit.
 
  Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan milks the film's one joke for all it's worth — which isn't much — before settling into the rote rhythms of a buddy picture. Mac and Kutcher have an easy chemistry, which makes the confection go down easily enough, and Judith Scott and Zoë Saldaña acquit themselves well as Mac's wife and daughter, respectively, but all four actors seem constrained by the bland familiarity of the plot and dialogue attributed to writers David Ronn, Jay Scherick and Peter Tolan.
 
  Saldaña and Kutcher play Theresa Jones and Simon Green, a young couple happily in love and living in a Manhattan loft on the joys of a dual income. She's an artsy photographer, he's a hotshot stockbroker — easily the most overused cinematic occupations of the last 15 years — but somehow they're making it work. They pack up for a weekend trek to New Jersey to meet Theresa's parents and break the news of their engagement on the occasion of the Jones' 25th anniversary and renewal of their vows.
 
  The red herring here is Simon's whiter-shade-of-pale skin and Percy Jones' (Mac's) reaction when he discovers that his future son-in-law is not the Tiger Woods of Wall Street. Percy, a loan officer at a bank and ever-skeptical of Theresa's usual artiste boyfriends, has run a credit check on Simon and found him to be first-rate. His main concerns are that his daughter find a man who will treat her well and not have sex with her under his roof.
 
  In fact, Percy actually seems more homophobic than racist. He is suspicious that Simon does not play sports and is extremely uncomfortable with the metrosexuality of Dante (Robert Curtis Brown), the broadly effeminate yet straight man planning the anniversary party.
 
  Race is seldom dealt with head-on in Hollywood films, so it's no real surprise that "Guess Who" cops out. Other than the initial setup and some timid, clichéd attempts to broach the subject, the color of the characters' skin is nearly superfluous. The story's engine revolves around Simon not telling Theresa that he has just quit his job, and then lying about it. The film refers to the treatment that Theresa and Simon face as an interracial couple but never shows it.
 
  The one scene that really focuses on the issue is a family dinner in which Percy goads Simon into telling some jokes that tiptoe up to and then cross the line of what apparently is acceptable. The scene is a little uncomfortable and almost feels dangerous — something the rest of the film lacks — but even it fizzles out.
 
  The presence of Mac accentuates the sense of a lost opportunity for a trenchant, timely satire. He is an actor of paradoxical talents that would be perfect for something with an edge. He is so good at portraying slow burns, searing side glances and underlying rage that his bulging eyes hint at the possibility of imminent spontaneous combustion. At the same time, his Cheshire grin and knowing walk smack of contented cool. This hot/cold duality makes for tantalizing possibilities that are sadly not to be found here.
 
  It says something about the timidity of the corporate-dominated entertainment industry that a contemporary film lacks the audacity of a 30-year-old sitcom.

Certain actors, like Jackie Gleason or Spencer Tracy, were built for disgruntlement, and Bernie Mac is one of them. It's there in his defensive purse-lipped scowl, in his eyes, which are always widening (or threatening to) with skeptical fury, and in his voice, a low funky musical growl that can rise an octave or two when he's ticked off. The phrase ''high dudgeon'' might have been invented to describe him; dudgeon is what Bernie Mac gets high on. As a comic personality, he's a paradox  a thin-skinned egomaniac. Yet his raspy irritability, honed to a fine froth of satirical gruffness in his stand-up routines and on his television series, wouldn't wear nearly so well if it weren't for the deep dish of sweetness at his core. Tall and thickly padded, he's a growling grizzly bear of a man, with a teddy bear hidden inside.
Guess Who  is a loose remake of the 1967 interracial-romance comedy Guess Who's Coming to Dinner , this time with the races reversed, and the smartest thing the filmmakers did was to get Mac to play the Spencer Tracy role: the cranky, bourgeois, secretly panicky father whose philosophy of tolerance is tested when his daughter brings home a fiancé who happens to be of the ''wrong'' color. Mac's Percy Jones, a bank loan officer with a roomy, elegant house in a small New Jersey town, is about to throw a weekend party to celebrate his 25th wedding anniversary. There's a funny moment early on when his daughter, Theresa (Zoë Saldaña), arrives with her boyfriend, a Wall Street player on the rise named Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher), and Percy, before he has had the chance to be introduced, naturally assumes that the fine young fellow he's been hearing about is their black cabdriver. The scene lends new meaning to the notion of color blindness.
Once he's set straight, Percy looks at Simon, the yuppie Manhattan white boy, and he doesn't much like what he sees. For all his hostility, he's too middle class to say out loud what's bothering him. He treats Simon as a pariah, but he does it by holding the race card close to his vest. In this sitcom-y culture clash, racial tension is exploited for the occasional quick-hit gag (songs like ''Walk on the Wild Side,'' with its ''colored girls'' refrain, pop up on the car radio), only to be displaced at every turn. Since Percy won't condone his daughter sleeping with Simon, the men end up bunking together in Percy's basement rec room: a two-guys-in-bed visual joke that's as far from funny as it is from credible. They engage in a smash-and-grab go-cart duel, and the rest of the film consists of cliché oedipal grousing. Percy, a bit of a prig, sneers at Simon for ordering a vodka before dinner, and though he approves of the man's financial career, the big twist is that Simon has mysteriously quit his job. Horrors! What will happen if Percy finds out?
Guess Who's Coming to Dinner  was one of the most genteel message movies ever made, with Sidney Poitier, as the superstar physician fiancé, cast as a white dream of black perfection. Yet Poitier brought this plaster saint to life, and the movie, in its rose-colored way, explored issues of love and bigotry with a perky, insistent humanity. Tracy, in his last screen role, showed you a crusty progressive man's blinders and then removed them. The film was noble but never sanctimonious.
Guess Who , made in an era of greater freedom, is a far more timid movie. There's a showpiece scene in which Simon tells black jokes at the dinner table (I wish Percy would have responded with a few white ones), but that's the film's token moment of audacity. If you're going to cast a live-wire cutup like Ashton Kutcher in a comedy of stereotypes, why not make him, say, a hip-hop fan with a fool's daring, or an earnest left-wing politico, or something? Kutcher, who has the beady gaze of a trickster  opportunist, is stuck playing an innocuous nice guy, which he does almost too well for comfort.
Putting an interracial love story on screen may have been bold in 1967, but by now it should be more casual than it is. The skittish, focus-grouped blandness of Guess Who  comes through in the flavorlessness of the romance: Simon and Theresa are characters with their egos sanded down  they have zero cultural differences to conquer. Zoë Saldaña is a lovely presence, but I never believed that a woman this free of quirks sprung from a walking temper tantrum like Bernie Mac. As the two men learn to accept each other, Guess Who , with its PG-13 putdowns, turns into the kind of love story that Hollywood feels most comfortable with: a buddy movie, salt-and-pepper variety. All that's missing is the cop car.

uess Who's Coming to Dinner,"  that corny, earnest comedy of racial tolerance from 1967, has been remade as a domestic farce, with the roles reversed. This time, in "Guess Who"  (dinner having been replaced by an entire weekend), the crusty, suspicious father who must overcome his prejudices is black (Bernie Mac), while his daughter's fianc� (originally a doctor played by Sidney Poitier, now a stockbroker played by Ashton Kutcher) is white. Is the new version evidence of social progress or of cultural decline? A bit of both, perhaps. On the side of progress, it seems that the racial hang-ups and pieties that made "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" both necessary and wincingly stiff have relaxed, and that interracial love is not the big deal it used to be. As for cultural decline, well, the name Ashton Kutcher is pretty much a synonym for it. But it is hard to get very upset about this remake. For one thing, the first movie, important though it may have been, was not all that great. And for another, "Guess Who," directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan ("Barbershop 2") from a screenplay credited to David Ronn, Jay Scherick and Peter Tolan, is so mild and thin that it doesn't inspire much of a reaction at all. With one exception - a dinner table scene that is by far the most memorable in the movie - the racial humor is studiously unprovocative. Other avenues of comedy (the differences between men and women, the sexuality of party planners, the humorous effects of alcohol) are dutifully traveled rather than imaginatively explored. What is left - the potentially interesting, mostly squandered premise that probably caused the picture to be greenlighted in the first place - is a cross-racial buddy comedy based on the confrontation between Mr. Mac's bearish truculence and Mr. Kutcher's loose, spazzy amiability. The two performers do their best, but the writing is so tired and the direction so slack that their collisions never acquire much momentum or spark. They are quick and nimble comic actors in the movie, which for the most part strands them in a lumbering sequence of slackly paced, predictable scenes. Mr. Mac's character, Percy Jones (most people in the film, including his immediate family, use both names), is a New Jersey loan officer about to renew his vows with Marilyn, his wife of 25 years (Judith Scott). Percy's older daughter, Theresa (Zo� Salda�a), is coming from New York with her boyfriend, Simon (Mr. Kutcher). Theresa has neglected to inform her family that Simon is white, and he has not told her that he just quit his job at a prestigious investment bank. Those two omissions provide fuel for the misunderstandings to come, which culminate in the usual relationship-threatening recriminations followed, in the nick of time, by reconciliation. As he did in "Just Married," Mr. Kutcher plays a friendly young man attached to an intensely attractive woman and prevented by circumstances from sleeping with her. In this case, it is Percy Jones's stern, patriarchal attitude that keeps the lovers apart, as he winds up sharing a fold-out bed in the basement with his would-be son-in-law to protect his daughter's honor. Simon, who grew up without a father (one of the film's subtler reversals of stereotype), may be exasperated by Percy's bullying, but he also respects the older man's devotion. The bullying, though not as sadistic as Robert De Niro's treatment of Ben Stiller in "Meet the Parents," is nonetheless pretty constant. It reaches a peak in that dinner table moment in which Percy goads Simon into telling racist jokes, goading him to cross the line and then taking offense when he does. The rest of "Guess Who" is not nearly so reckless, but its blandness has less to do with caution than with comfort. In its easy, affluent setting, what prejudices remain can be shrugged and laughed off. "Guess Who" suggests, convincingly enough, that race relations (to use a quaint-sounding term) have gotten a lot better since 1967, which may be one of the reasons this movie is so much worse than its predecessor. "Guess Who" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual references and some profanity.

If only as much thought went into the script for this listless comedy as its marketing calculus, which roughly translates to: "Youth plus urban markets equals solid opening weekend." Failing to mine most of its comedic possibilities, pic yields some reasonably warm moments but few laughs. Thanks to whatever excitement the premise and its leads engender, domestic box office prospects don't look bad as a spring fling, but there's scant chance of a long-term relationship.
Take it as a sign of progress that "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" can actually be reversed for comic effect almost four decades later, at least in theory. Yet stripping away the racial element, too many moments here prove unconvincing and downright stupid -- making it difficult to identify with the situations, much less the characters.
Bernie Mac plays Percy Jones, the doting suburban New Jersey dad about to renew his wedding vows, which brings daughter Theresa (Zoe Saldana) and live-in boyfriend Simon (Ashton Kutcher) home from New York for the occasion. Theresa, however, hasn't told her parents that Simon is, as he puts it, pigment challenged.
Of greater significance, Percy can't seem to handle the idea that anyone might lay a lingering hand on his twentysomething offspring. What ensues, then, are a series of idiotic moments, from Percy rushing Simon to a hotel (of course, there's no room at the inn) to the two men sharing a bed (done to considerably greater effect on "All in the Family" more than 30 years ago).
Race notwithstanding, Percy's behavior comes across as bizarre, though to be fair, Simon's own silliness -- telling Percy whopping lies and rattling off African-American jokes to demonstrate how cool he is -- is every bit as off-putting. There is a promising drinking game, however, based on the number of times someone says "Percy Jones," which includes the lead character, who regularly talks about himself in the third person.
If there's a saving grace, it's in the easy rapport that exists between Kutcher and Saldana, which generally surpasses the lines they're given. Beyond that, only a few rays of light find their way into director Kevin Rodney Sullivan's uneven direction, which can't settle on a tone. Those include an amusing bit when Theresa and her mom (Judith Scott) take refuge with Theresa's aunt, as well as Hal Williams' fleeting turn as Percy's even grumpier dad, who doesn't hide his irritation over having whitey at the dinner table.
Kutcher offers a more buttoned-down version of his "That '70s Show" persona (he's a successful stockbroker who abruptly quits, for reasons that take too long to explain), but his charm only goes so far. And while Mac should come away with a better box office scorecard here than for "Mr. 3000," he's still yet to find a film worthy of his stand-up and TV gigs, though this comes closer to his sitcom-dad strike zone.
Ultimately, though, "Guess Who" plays like a squandered opportunity -- a film that could have wryly dealt with matters of race, or simply could have been funnier, had it possessed a clearer template than a star pairing and a truncated title.
As is, the movie is summed up by a moment where Simon and Percy ride in a car together, fidgeting uncomfortably as the radio keeps spiting out songs about interracial love -- a mild laugh that subsides about halfway through the scene. After that, it's just two guys in a vehicle, with nothing to say.

Guess Who   Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan   Columbia, in release
Professionally caustic and often brilliant, comedian Bernie Mac  still ain't got nothing on my pops and his friends. After I brought home a decidedly Nordic-featured lass (being a lighter shade of brown myself), my fatherwho, to his credit, won't spare his only son from a well-aimed jabshared with me what his friend had said after seeing my Nordiquette and me together: "Your boy done went Tiger Woods  on you." I had to smile because, well, that shit was funny, but funny because it hurt a little bitfunny because the hurt bled truth.
In Guess Who , Mac plays Spencer Tracy  to Ashton Kutcher 's Sidney Poitier  (yeah, I said it), racially inverting Stanley Kramer 's pointed, "pigmentation problem" classic, 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner . Kutcher isshockno Poitier, and his performance as Mac's prospective son-in-law is largely textureless. But the screenwriters deserve a cowardly lion's share of the blame. At times no more than a collection of comedic set piecesMac and Kutch sharing a bed, listening to "Ebony and Ivory," or racing go-kartsthe film is predictable and its humor is tension free, ultimately hurting only Mac, whose lifeblood is his threateningly melodic cadence and irresistible I-say-what-you-scared-to-say vibe. Mac's acidic humor is often predicated on a challenge, revealing the truth at the heart of every quiphis goading of Kutcher to tell black jokes over dinner is Guess Who 's sole piece of geniusand the script's lack of nerve fails to challenge him or its audience with enough dangerous humor.

BEAUTY SHOP    Directed by Bille Woodruff    MGM, opens March 30
A morality play paradoxically pimping self-reliance and community, 2002's Barbershop  stresses the importance of its titular location as a haven for free speech. After being chastised for his boneheaded dismissal of Rosa Parks 's achievements, Cedric the Entertainer 's character asks: "If we can't talk straight in a barbershop, then where can we talk straight?" An extended riff on its progenitor, Beauty Shop also offers opportunities for trenchant observation, though the clientele prefers kinky sex advice to sociopolitical chitchat. Girls just wanna have fun, and so does the film, which recycles the requisite moralizing into a breezy, sporadically funny package. Queen Latifah  takes the Ice Cube  role, playing a cosmetologist who ditches a ritzy Atlanta salon in order to beautify the ladies DIY-style. Highlights include a drive-by bitching from her former boss and a deus ex machina in the form of a pint-sized booty hound.
