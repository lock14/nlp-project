Andrew Niccol, the writer-director of Gattaca
 and S1mOne
 (as well as the writer of The Truman Show
 and The Terminal
), shines his usual cynicism on the subject of gunrunning in his new film, Lord of War
. The movie is a strange amalgam of compelling visuals and fascinating vocational details forged with deep moral ambivalence and often hollow didacticism. The film�s stunning opening sequence, in which we observe (often in extreme close-up and glistening phallic displays) the life cycle of a bullet from the bullet�s point of view � as it�s manufactured, shipped, sold, and finally lodged between the eyes of an African kid � is a visual tour de force. The sequence instantly sucks us into the gun-crazy world of Niccol�s central protagonist Yuri Orlov (Cage). Orlov, who emigrated to the United States with his family as a boy, grew up in the crime-ridden Little Odessa section of Brighton Beach. As a young man searching for his purpose in life, he has the breakthrough revelation that guns are what makes the world go �round. He even compares the thrill of his first gun sale to the thrill of first sex. Yet Orlov is no white-heat-crazed gun nut whose yen for firepower is a classic substitute for sexual inadequacies. His devotion to firearms derives from an economic understanding that the world�s demand for guns will never waver and selling them is the surest path to eternal riches: supply and demand. Orlov will sell to anyone; he takes no sides in political disputes, unlike his competitor Simeon Weisz (Holm), who dismisses the neophyte gunrunner Orlov for his international promiscuity. Many of the details of how Orlov conducts business turn out to be as riveting as a Tom Clancy novel. However, Lord of War
 gives short shrift to its secondary characters: More about the contradictions between Weisz (who claims to be in the business to make governments, not money) and Orlov  would have been welcome, as would more fleshed-out depictions of Orlov�s trophy wife (Moynahan), literal brother-in-arms (Leto), and dogged Interpol agent Valentine (Hawke), who plays cat to Orlov�s canary. It�s been many years since we�ve seen Cage as well-cast as he is here: The actor�s cynical bravado is put to great use in Lord of War
. Still, more than anything, what bogs down the film is its overweening use of voiceovers � a narrative crutch in the best of circumstances and a pedantic tool in the worst. The technique increases the feeling that Niccol has only recently discovered the dirty underworld of arms dealing and now needs to proclaim its evils to the world. In this regard, Lord of War
 is messy and ill-defined, and as scattershot as its grand topic.


''Lord of War," Andrew Niccol's gunrunning drama, literally starts off with a bang. The film's opening credits, scored to Buffalo Springfield's ''For What It's Worth," are shot from the point of view of a bullet as it makes its way from a Russian factory to a loading dock, to another loading dock, to a truck heading into the jungle, to a remote village, to the clip of a gun, to the barrel of the gun and, finally, into the brain of an anonymous young African man. He may be a killer himself or he may be an innocent. The bullet doesn't care.
It's one of the most visually arresting and morally loaded opening sequences I've ever seen, and the surprise is that it's in a Nicolas Cage movie. The star plays Yuri Orlov, a Brooklyn-bred immigrant's son who rises to the top of the illegal arms trade during the 1980s and '90s. We're meant to take Yuri as a likable Satan, a businessman. Early on, he tells us, ''There are 550 million firearms in circulation around the globe, one for every 12 people. The only question is: How do we arm the other 11?"
''Lord of War" is advocacy entertainment -- an act of mainstream provocation -- and, for the most part, it works unusually well. Like ''The Constant Gardener," like ''Beyond Borders" and ''Tears of the Sun" (both 2003), the movie wants to shake you up and make you mad enough to do
 something, but unlike other filmmakers, Niccol (''Gattaca") has the skill to get you dramatically involved and thinking at the same time. His outrage is balanced by a storyteller's native interest in what his characters will do next.
He has in Yuri a charming reptile of an antihero, a child of the go-go '80s willing to sell his soul for the chance to strut on a worldwide stage. The character narrates his own story with a playful cynicism that's tinged with Cage's own oddball inflections, and Niccol's dialogue is packed with glibly nasty epigrams. ''I was an equal opportunity merchant of death," Yuri casually brags. ''I sold to every army except the Salvation Army." That line gets a laugh, and the laugh jams in your throat.
We see him slowly rise to success from a small-time wannabe who haunts international gun fairs; the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1989 is the break he's been waiting for. Yuri joyously kisses the images on TV not from love of freedom but because of the millions of used AK-47s he knows are about to hit the black market. Soon he's in business with his Uncle Dmitri (Eugene Lazarev), a former Soviet colonel with an arms stockpile in Ukraine.
There are rivals, among them the graying master gun merchant Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm). Yuri's enemies include a Dudley Do-Right of an Interpol agent named Jack Valentine, played by Ethan Hawke as if he's still stoked up from the last Amnesty International meeting. That's a compliment, actually; Hawke has to deliver the film's preachiest dialogue but he puts it across with an enjoyably hot-wired righteousness.
Dropping in and out of the proceedings is Yuri's kid brother Vitaly (Jared Leto), a business partner until cocaine and a conscience get in the way. Yuri has a wife, too, a gorgeous, vapid supermodel named Eva (Bridget Moynahan) who stays in Manhattan and never asks questions. So, yes, we have a little bit of Fredo from ''The Godfather" here, and a lot of Michelle Pfeiffer from ''Scarface" -- ''Lord of War" isn't shy about wearing its influences where you can see them.
Niccol leaves these shopworn characters in America and increasingly sends Yuri to African dictatorships, where his Russian firearms find ready buyers in Liberian president Andre Baptiste (Eamonn Walker, his role a fictionalized take on General Charles Taylor). These scenes start hellishly and turn more so, as Yuri loses what few moral bearings he has and the demons start closing in. In one startling image, he wanders distraught through the African night and encounters a pair of immense hyenas. Why don't they take a bite? Like the joke says, professional courtesy.
Are we supposed to feel sorry for this man? Of course not, but at times Niccol gets too close for comfort, only to finally pull back into easy speechifying and finger-pointing at certain world leaders and weapons industries. Until that point, some may think the film shares Yuri's joie de mort
; the naive may think we're
 supposed to share it. Isn't it refreshing, though, when a director trusts audiences to do the moral arithmetic themselves? Yuri isn't an especially deep character -- that's the movie's biggest flaw -- but the buttons he pushes reach deep enough to do the trick. Niccol gives the devil his due and then kicks the matter back to us.


         Writer-director Andrew Niccol has either never heard of or has chosen to ignore the old Hollywood dictum that insists "if you want to send a message, use Western Union." His "Lord of War" is unapologetically purposeful, a forceful film with a lot on its mind.
 
  Unfortunately, the problem Niccol addresses — the devastating consequences of the worldwide trade in weapons — is a lot more involving than the story he's constructed around it. Any time you're watching a film in which the statistics in the voice-over have more intrinsic drama than the protagonists' lives, you know you're in trouble.
 


         






    Who knew, for instance, that the gun shops in the U.S. outnumber the McDonald's? Or that, in the stat that opens the film, there are more than 550 million firearms now in circulation, one for every 12 people on the planet? "The only question," says arms dealer Yuri Orlov without a hint of sarcasm, "is how can we arm the other 11."
 
  It's a mark of "Lord of War's" visual flair (it was shot by Amir Mokri) that Orlov, played by Nicolas Cage, makes this statement standing amid the smoldering rubble of a combat zone in an out-of-place suit and tie. The film's credits sequence, which follows a single bullet on its short life from factory assembly line to African shootout, is equally kinetic.
 
  Filmmaker Niccol made his reputation as a writer: He did the script for "The Truman Show" and the original story for Steven Spielberg's "The Terminal," and he wrote and directed the offbeat science fiction "Gattaca." He makes the best use of that skill by using Orlov's life story — apparently a composite of five real-life dealers — to outline how the international arms trade functions.
 
  Born in Ukraine, Orlov, his brother Vitaly (Jared Leto) and their parents emigrated to Brooklyn's Brighton Beach Russian community and opened a restaurant. Bored with his dead-end life, he decides to become a gun dealer after witnessing a gangland shootout. "You go into the restaurant business because 'people are always going to have to eat,' " he explains in the film's just about continuous voice-over. "That was the day I realized my destiny lay in fulfilling another basic human need."
 
  The fascination in "Lord of War," as in most life stories, is in watching Orlov tenaciously make his way to the top of the arms dealer food chain, supplying "every army but the Salvation Army." Niccol, who appears to have done a prodigious amount of research, shows us the tricks of the weapon supplying trade and lets us in on horrific scenarios like the $32-billion worth of arms stolen from Ukraine between 1982 and 1992.
 
  As a director, Niccol has chosen a pulpy, heightened "Scarface" style for "Lord of War," which works better visually than it does as a vehicle for any acting beyond striking poses. Ethan Hawke fits in as Yuri's humorless nemesis, Interpol agent Jack Valentine, but the more restrained Ian Holm seems abashed as rival arms dealer Simeon Weisz.
 
  This dramatic insufficiency haunts "Lord of War's" unconvincing attempts to fill out Orlov's personal story by giving him a glamorous trophy wife he once worshipped from afar (Bridget Moynahan) and having brother Vitaly develop a weakness for cocaine and alcohol. Neither of these scenarios rises much above the pro forma.
 
  The same can be said of Orlov's professional entanglement with Liberian president Andre Baptiste, strongly played by Eamonn Walker. Though this character, likely based on the real life Charles Taylor, is authentic enough, on film the power-mad-dictator scenario is too familiar to be effective.
 
  The sense that there is truth behind the portrayal of Orlov as an arms dealer, however, keeps us interested in this film longer than we otherwise would be. It is, for instance, fascinating and horrifying to learn that the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council are the world's biggest arms suppliers. "Lord of War" succeeds in raising awareness, but dramatic success is beyond its abilities.

It's clear that writer-director Andrew Niccol did his homework before making Lord of War , the tale of an international arms dealer. Watching the movie, which is like a feature-length trailer crossed with a lecture held together by Nicolas Cage's ''hard-boiled'' narration (''They say every man has his price, but not every man gets it''), we learn that the outlaws who sell arms on the black market deal in Uzis, Glocks, and Kalashnikov assault rifles; that they'll offer their products to everyone from the rebels of Lebanon to the dictator of Liberia (Eamonn Walker). More than that  and this is the film's big insight, so hold on to your popcorn  we learn that weapons salesmen are sleazy troubleshooters who don't care about the harm they cause. Gosh. Cage's Yuri Orlov, partnering with his party-boy brother (Jared Leto), isn't much more than a generic crooked businessman boating off in dangerous gray suits to the world's trouble spots. Lord of War  comes on like it's the GoodFellas  of global assault hardware, but Niccol stages ideas for scenes rather than the scenes themselves. He never quite creates a present tense, and the result is a dead pile of information in search of a movie.


Brimming with cinematic confidence, cynicism, chutzpah plus dramatic bungles, Andrew Niccol's ambitious "Lord of War" views today's international arms trade through its anti-hero, a young Ukrainian-American lured by the promise of wealth in the weapons biz. A stark departure for Niccol from his interest in the near-future ("The Truman Show," "Gattaca," "Simone"), this globalist dramedy owes much to the political gallows humor of Joseph Heller's "Catch-22" and the rise-and-fall structure of the conventional biopic. Despite Nicolas Cage's strongest perf in many a season, ragged shifts in tone will cool aud involvement and keep general B.O. numbers in the modest range.
Few films since Michael Mann's "The Insider" have tackled a burning, complex contemporary topic with the ferocity and filmic energy that "Lord of War" applies, and Niccol should earn considerable plaudits for his daring approach. Coming fast on the heels of "The Constant Gardener," Niccol's film is more original, particularly in its refreshingly politically incorrect angle on Africa.
At the same time, Niccol's reliance on massive chunks of voice-over narration (care of the hard-working Cage) and a snide tone leave the unfortunate impression that the film is extremely callous toward its subject. "Lord of War" wades in the dangerous waters of politically black humor, which can capsize the most important message without a strong hand in command.
With Yuri Orlov (Cage) speaking directly to the camera from the first moments, followed by an astonishing title sequence filmed from the p.o.v. of a bullet as it goes from being manufactured to puncturing the skull of an African youth, pic's strengths and problems are instantly on display.
From Yuri's blithe attitude toward his work as a weapons dealer to the almost goofy camera angle of the bullet, the comic tone is established and then suddenly violated by real violence, leaving auds unsure how to respond.
Yuri narrates his upbringing in Gotham's Little Odessa quarter, where he and brother Vitali (Jared Leto) were raised by their Ukrainian emigre parents. Yuri witnesses a mob hit in 1982, and realizes that there's a real demand for guns and bullets -- and cash could be made supplying them.
From strictly small-time customers, Yuri, in almost absurdly quick order, brings now-partner Vitali along to the West Berlin arms fair of 1983, where master arms dealer Simeon Weisz (Ian Holm) gives him a one-sentence brush-off: "I'm in the business to change governments."
Yuri, though, is in this business to do business -- a crucial distinction that defines his character for the rest of the film. If "Lord of War" makes its most obvious point by decrying the human cost of the global proliferation of arms, its subtler point is that in Yuri's view, selling AK-47s or helicopter gunships is no different from selling refrigerators. Even this is made comic, with a slo-mo shot of an automatic machine gun accompanied by the sound of a clinging cash register.
Soon, Yuri is in charge of illegally registered sea vessels. Charging on board is dogged Interpol agent Valentine (Ethan Hawke), the relentless cat to Yuri's mouse for most of the remaining 90 minutes.
Editor Zach Staenberg deserves high credit for the film's rollicking sense of time and years whizzing by. On his frequent international trips, Yuri continually sees a girl from his youth, Little Odessa goddess Eva (Bridget Moynihan), now a supermodel. While Vitali gives in to the temptations of cocaine, Yuri elaborately arranges to track down Eva, and soon has her as his trophy wife in lavish Central Park East digs.
Pic shifts to a more troublesome midsection, divided roughly between a dull, unconvincing set of domestic scenes involving Yuri and Eva's parched marriage, and Yuri's dealings with a bloodthirsty Liberian dictator named Baptiste Senior (Eamonn Walker).
Regularly dressed in his "Reservoir Dogs"-style black suit in a country filled with dead bodies and muddy streets, Yuri looks increasingly strange in Liberia's mayhem. A sense of doom slowly descends on Yuri's character, most brilliantly visualized when Valentine catches up with him again in an airborne chase and handcuffs him on the ground of a dusty airfield.
Niccol's script is finally too much for the film to hold onto. Yuri's life, globe hopping and two-facedness appear to be more than any one feature could possibly contain.
While the Yuri character is never less than fascinating, the script struggles with its approach to him. Lost along the way are some potential dramatic anchors, such as the father-son dynamic between Weisz and Yuri that seems to be a central story point but is never developed.
Nor does Yuri and Vitali's relationship ever ring quite true, including a third-act climax that nearly unravels the entire film.
What's missing most in the story is a certain humanity that Cage must provide on his own. He brings a theatrical irony to bear here with brilliance, even as his ever-present voice on the soundtrack serves to give texture and dimension -- even if it goes on much too long.
By contrast, Walker is far too emphatic and one-note, Moynihan blander-than-bland and Holm criminally cut short of screentime.
Pic looks and feels authentically international, with lenser Amir Mokri finding distinct imagery to match Gotham, Czech and South African settings. Song selection, like much of the humor, is a bit too smarty-pants for the film's own good.

Let no one say that Lord of War  lacks for auteurist aspiration. In the opening-title sequence, set to the strains of Buffalo Springfield 's hippie anthem "For What It's Worth," the camera takes the perspective of a bullet as it journeys from assembly line to rifle chamber to small boy's forehead, this last impact dramatically discharging the final credit on the screen: "Written and directed by Andrew Niccol ." Screenwriter of The Truman Show , Niccol previously helmed Gattaca , which imagined a future apartheid between test-tube supermen and naturally conceived shmoes, and S1m0ne , a similarly flat-footed media satire about a frustrated director who whips up a starlet from CGI scratch. With his confused, distended latest, Niccol relocates from the desert of the real to the global killing fields, but as slick, flashy public-service announcements go, Lord of War  is no Constant Gardener .
Yuri Orlov  (Nicolas Cage ) is the man with the gun over there, be it Liberia , Sierra Leone , Afghanistan , or most other war zones of the given moment. As the striver child of Russian immigrants in mob-ruled Little Odessa, Yuri concludes from available evidence that weaponry is an insatiable market; he flexes connections at a local synagogue to make his first sale to an Israeli agent and taps his soused old uncle back in the just-collapsed Soviet Union  to help him raid mother Russia's stockpilethus one-upping his sole apparent rival, a Cold War dinosaur played by Ian Holm . Now reckoning himself the world's preeminent arms dealer, this rhapsodist of the Kalashnikov acquires his teenage wet dream (Bridget Moynahan ) and eludes the relentless Interpol  agent Jack Valentine  (Ethan Hawke ) at every turn, tramping from bedlam to bedlam with just a couple of suitcases and no apparent security detail, excepting the occasional assist from his cokehead little bro, Vitaly (Jared Leto ).
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong. Yuri will happily arrange an armored personnel carrier for psychotic self-proclaimed Liberian president Andre Baptiste  (Eamonn Walker ); its possible uses are none of the salesman's business. In his conviction that humans are hard-wired to kill each otherand thus to buy his productsOrlov is the purest vessel of the Darwinian free market imaginable. (He politely overlooks the fact that most of the people firing and being fired upon by his guns are poor and black, lest it upset his notion of natural laws.) Niccol's fatal error is in making the protagonist at once amoral and insipid, an admixture thickened by Cage's loquacious yet stoned voice-over and Moynahan's moist-eyed tremblings as the trophy wife. As our host drones on and on over cartoon-panel carnage, Lord of War  resembles less ripped-from-the-headlines agitprop than an overgrown adolescent's hermetic fantasia, and we never get out of his head.
