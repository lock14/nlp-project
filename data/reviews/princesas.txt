Spanish director Fernando León de Aranoa made a tiny splash in 2002, when his Javier Bardem drama Mondays in the Sun  beat out Pedro Almodóvar's Talk to Her  as Spain's official entry for the Oscars. He returns with Princesas , an ambling tale of two Madrid hookers-with-hearts-of-gold (one wants implants, the other misses her kid). The way that Aranoa so clearly venerates his lively women feels Almodóvar-esque, but the movie aims most of all to suggest that hookerdom is hell  and it's neither realistic nor unsentimental enough to pull that off.

 A maudlin melodrama about prostitutes in Madrid, “Princesas” is not, alas, the new film by Pedro Almodóvar, but a dilution of his manner by the writer-director Fernando León de Aranoa.  The princesses of the title — and what a facile conceit that is — are Caye (Candela Peña), a mousy Spaniard saving up for breast implants, and Zulema (Micaela Nevárez), a foxy Dominican saving money to send back home. They will bond and squabble over the course of the film, in which narrative drive is replaced by an episodic drip of breakdowns, soul searching, girly behavior (shopping, gossip, hairdressing) and improbable poetic monologues.  Mr. Aranoa is good with actors but lousy with ideas, though he broaches themes of class conflict and the economic basis of racism. His best material  observes the rivalry between a clique of native working girls and the dark-skinned streetwalkers newly arrived on the scene. Otherwise, “Princesas” rehearses “hooker with a heart of gold” tropes and indulges Almodóvarian clichés of Spanish spunk and solidarity.  Irrelevant subplots burden the leads. Ms. Peña is saddled with a brittle, lonely mother. Ms. Nevárez fends off an abusive client. Both try hard to energize the material, but there’s only so much to be done under the guidance of a director whose imaginative limitations are suggested by his conception, offered in the press kit, of the Zulema character: “a princess in exile, sweet and swarthy, doomed daily by desperation to eat the bitter bread of banishment.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

In "Princesses," a warmhearted, sharp-eyed study of a roller-coaster friendship between two women who happen to be prostitutes, Fernando Leon de Aranoa confirms his Loach-like ability to convert marginalized subjects into socially committed cinema. As with his two most recent features, "Neighborhood" and "Mondays in the Sun," this loosely-structured pic feels authentic, its underdramatized script resolutely nonjudgmental. Helmer's rep means that "Princesses" could get a royal reception in selected English language and Latin American arthouses despite its difficult subject matter.
The family of Caye (Candela Pena, excellent) doesn't know she works the streets.
Wanting to complain about the noise in the apartment block where she lives, she discovers Dominican prostitute Zulema (statuesque Micaela Nevarez) in the bathroom, badly beaten up. Her aggressor is a civil servant (Antonio "Morris" Duran, superbly creepy), with whom Zulema is sleeping gratis on the promise he will one day obtain residence papers for her.
In the low-rent hair salon where Caye hangs out with her hooker friends, the attitude toward immigrant women is negative, but the big-hearted Caye accompanies Zulema, who is working to send money back to her 5-year-old kid in the Dominican Republic, to the hospital, and becomes a kind of guardian angel to her.
Lonesome in the street one night, Caye picks up computer technician Manuel (Luis Callejo), who tells her over a drink that the key to professional success is the passion one puts into one's work. An example of the film's wonderful dialogue, occasionally punctuated by carefully judged silence, is Manuel reaction to learning Caye is a prostie. 
Leon's feel for emotional truth means he sidesteps most of the cliches implicit in hooker-based material, neither playing things didactically or taking the loose, drifting storyline to a moralistic conclusion.
Caye is an engaging creation, brought to life by a fine thesp with a face that can switch from joy to melancholy in a split second. Blissfully ignorant of real life, she's a dreamer whose imaginings are unexciting, if sadly plausible -- all she wants, for example, is for someone to pick her up after work.
Pic's greatest strength is its dialogue, particularly the catty, absurdist hair-salon banter and the heart-to-hearts -- backed by delicate guitar and piano -- between Caye and Zulema, during which Caye reveals herself to be a street philosopher, sometimes at too great length. ("We exist because someone is thinking about us," she rhapsodizes.) There is also much verbal comedy, sharply played.
Visuals are quasi-docu, with much busy, hand-held lensing (a new stylistic trait for the helmer), but only on occasion are the images graphic. On the negative side, Zulema's stint as a sex education teacher goes nowhere in particular, the issue of why Caye is a prostitute is not addressed, and there are a couple of minor characters too many.

Caye (Candela Peña), a prostitute in Madrid , has begun losing business to the young immigrants who undersell her. Zulema (Micaela Nevárez ) is one of those immigrants, from the Dominican Republic , hustling to earn money for her mother and son back home. The women begin as antagonists, but when violence brings them together, they discover the sustenance that friendshipsomething neither of them seems to have experiencedcan bring. This deft film from Spanish writer-director Fernando León de Aranoa  errs only when it gives its protagonists speeches that are too self-consciously philosophical to feel real. (It also fails to offer justification for why Caye, apparently middle-class, is a prostitute.) Otherwise, Princesas is a well-crafted and moving look at two lonely lives, with a smartly minimal script that brings the women's grief into sharp relief. De Aranoa never condescends to his subjects, and Caye's mixture of aggression and tenderness is appealingly authentic. Could this be the first film to use a cell phone ringtone to devastating emotional effect?
