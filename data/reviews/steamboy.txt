Director �tomo is best known stateside as the man behind 1998�s anim� landmark Akira
 and 2001�s equally stunning Metropolis
, but Steamboy
, 10 years in the making at the unfathomable cost more than $20 million U.S., is his most personal, and most personable, film. The cyberpunk dystopia of Akira
, with its roving gangs of 5,000cc motorcycle maniacs and apocalyptic visions, is replaced this time out with an almost elegiac story set in the Victorian era, a place and time that�s part British period piece, all bowler-bedecked Mancunian propriety and gee-whiz gadgetry, and part Amazing Stories
. There�s none of the soul-wearying cynicism of �tomo�s previous masterworks, and in fact, if anything, the optimistic Steamboy
 plays like an ode to the possibilities of the creative act. That act comes here with the invention of a device known as the "steam ball," a new, mechanical source of limitless energy that is at the heart of Steamboy
, and as always, the possibility of using such magnificent power � for good or evil � is the crux of the matter. Invented by the father and grandfather of  Young Ray Steam, the steam ball is eagerly sought after by the O�Hara Foundation, a sinister proto-technology corporation that aspires to, well, if not world domination then at least a healthy market share in the steam-powered doohickey demographic. Chosen to guard the device until someone can figure out what to do � or not do, as the case may be � with it, the invention-happy lad must outwit legions of nefarious do-badders in what becomes one of the most entertainingly protracted chase films ever animated. �tomo�s storyline is near simplistic when compared with much of the indecipherable philosophical musings of his previous outings. However, denuded of any cyberpunk philosophizing, the film aspires to and achieves a dazzlingly straightforward rush that finds its protagonist in astonishing action set-piece after set-piece. You barely have time to catch your breath after he�s captured aboard a roaring locomotive (via a zeppelin snatch, natch) before it�s on to the next gorgeous bit of mind-bending, Tom Swiftian-adventure, all of which ends in a lengthy but genuinely pulse-quickening multiclimax that should have die-hard anim� fans as well as the rest of us gnawing their nails to the quick and beyond. As ever, �tomo�s attention to the most minute details of setting and character are beyond reproach. If Victorian Manchester had been remotely like this, H.G. Wells never would have bothered to pen The Time Machine
 � he�d have just stepped outside and into the fray.


In 1988, filmmaker Katsuhiro Otomo drop-kicked animation into the future with ''Akira," an apocalyptic and ultraviolent fable that married the wide-eyed visual style of Japanese anime to the cynical concerns of cyberpunk science fiction. The shock waves of that film are still being felt 17 years later, as Otomo returns with ''Steamboy," his first animated feature since the debut.
Surprisingly, the new film is set in the past: 1860s England at the height of the industrial revolution. But ''Steamboy" is no less frenzied or technology-obsessed than ''Akira." If anything, it's even noisier: trains crash, gears clash, and a humongous climactic battle of future weaponry erupts in central London. But the film is also often immensely thrilling in the most elemental ways, even in a US-release cut that's 23 minutes shorter than the Japanese original. See this on a big screen if you're going to see it at all.
More than anything, ''Steamboy" is a vessel for Otomo's ongoing anxieties about nuclear holocaust and the arms race. If ''Akira" was a cyberpunk allegory about Armageddon, the new film is a steampunk meditation on same, with all-out action sequences interrupted by pop-sociology debates about the purposes of science itself. While this lifts the movie well above the standard ''Pokémon" silliness, when one of the subsidiary characters informs the bickering hero and villain, ''This is no time for your annoying philosophies!," you do feel her pain.
(Note: the film is playing at the Kendall Square Cinema in both a dubbed English version and a subtitled Japanese print; only the former was available for review.)
All this, and ''Steamboy" is a zippy Tom Swiftian adventure, too. Our hero is Ray Steam (voiced in the Japanese original by Anne Suzuki and in the English-language dub by a very convincing Anna Paquin), a serious young lad whose father, Edward Steam (Masane Tsukayama/Alfred Molina), and grandfather, Lloyd Steam (Katsuo Nakamura/Patrick Stewart), are inventors far away working on hush-hush stuff. The action begins when a strange metal ball is delivered to the Steam home in Manchester, followed by henchmen from the mysterious O'Hara Foundation, followed by Grandfather himself. The latter tells Ray his father is dead and sends him scampering off with the widget ahead of the Foundation goons. Brief initial mayhem ensues.
Edward Steam is not dead, it turns out, but he might as well be. A half-human cyborg following an industrial accident, he oversees the O'Hara Foundation from the Steam Castle, a massive gothic edifice on the banks of the Thames that houses several Death Stars' worth of clockwork war-machinery. And lots of ducts. How this got by Queen Victoria's zoning board is anyone's guess.
Speaking of the queen, she pops up to open the scientific exposition that becomes ground zero for the film's apocalyptic struggle for control of the future of war. Participants include Edward Steam and his foundation, representatives from most of the developed countries of the world, and the Royal Navy. Weapons making their debut include prototype tanks, submarines, flying warriors, and ironclad infantrymen called -- in an overt nod to one of Otomo's crucial influences -- ''steam troopers." What Godzilla did to Tokyo, ''Steamboy" does to London, and the nuclear metaphor is exactly the same.
Still, if you're thinking this is an awful lot of ordnance for a movie that preaches pacifism, you're right. The problem with ''Steamboy" -- and it's a big one -- is that it fetishizes what it rails against, in the same way boys playing war shy away from a real fight while inventing ever more baroque scenarios of belligerence. That playground chauvinism also surfaces in Scarlett (Manami Konishi/Kari Wahlgren), the spoiled young heiress of the O'Hara millions and the one notable female character in ''Steamboy." She is, not to put too fine a point on it, absolutely horrid, and she'll leave girls in the audience with no way into the tale.
Boys of all ages, by contrast, will be mesmerized by the relentless, breathtakingly visualized action, even if the characters sometimes seem two-dimensional against the painterly and increasingly vast backdrops of this movie (mostly hand-drawn, with computer-generated imagery used to give the machines an H.R. Giger-style malignance).
At one point, the Foundation building itself takes to the air, the latest example of Japanese anime's taste for flying fortresses. Hayao Miyazaki, the grand master of Japanese animation, has indulged this cliché -- actually, he may have invented it -- in 1986's ''Castle in the Sky" and in the upcoming ''Howl's Moving Castle," due in US theaters this summer. But where Miyazaki is able to invest the image with art, ''Steamboy" finally just smothers it with craft.


         Like a junior high science fair on steroids, Katsuhiro Otomo's "Steamboy" has so many amazing gadgets in its Jules Verne-inspired arsenal that it's easy to be overawed by the machinery. A sometimes stirring adventure story and visual treat with its lush, painterly backgrounds and some virtuoso sequences, it's a stunning-to-look-at film marred by a less than searing pace and some narrative incoherence.
 
  Released in two versions — a subtitled "director's cut" opening at the Nuart and destined for art houses, as well as an English-language version aimed at mainstream audiences — the film took a decade to make and blends two- and three-dimensional animation in frequently breathtaking ways.
 


         






    Otomo is best known as the creator and director of the 1988 anime "Akira," an international breakthrough for Japanese animation that continues to be a cult favorite on the midnight movie circuit. The painstaking care that the filmmaker gives his work is seen in the detailed renderings of 1866 London and Manchester that are the backdrop for "Steamboy."
 
  The filmmaker shuns the worn-out post-apocalyptic scenarios seen in a lot of anime, setting his film amid the Industrial Revolution of 19th century England. At its center is the Steam family, three generations of unconventional, autodidactic inventors who are considered crackpots by the British scientific community, ridiculed for their belief in the power of steam.
 
  Young Ray Steam (voiced by Anna Paquin in the English-language version) is already following in his father and grandfather's footsteps working on a steam-driven unicycle. He eagerly awaits their return from Alaska, where they are working on a top-secret project.
 
  Unknown to Ray is that a terrible accident has estranged the two men, pitting them on opposite sides of a philosophical disagreement that could shape the future of the world. The patriarch, Lloyd Steam (Patrick Stewart), is an imposing figure who could comfortably step into a Soviet propaganda poster. "From risk comes progress," he shouts while pushing his workers during an experiment.
 
  The accident has left Ray's father Edward (Alfred Molina) a disfigured hulk with a Frankensteinian gait who makes Ayn Rand-like pronouncements about the power of science. Edward believes that a nation's security is imperative and that if his development of war machines provides that protection, so be it.
 
  The dispute creates a steam-powered arms race between the O'Hara Foundation, a profiteering U.S. weapons manufacturer, and the British Empire. The foundation plans to display and sell Edward's designs to military leaders from around the world at the Great Exhibition at Crystal Palace. Dirigibles, tanks and all manner of fantastical steam-powered machinery cruise, roll and soar through the frames of the film, eventually reducing much of London to a shambles.
 
  Otomo has maintained that there is no political message to the film, but there is clearly some anticapitalist, antiwar sentiment at its heart. Otomo takes some shots at the U.S. — the O'Hara family representative at the exhibition is the founder's ridiculous granddaughter Scarlett, who has a Chihuahua named Columbus — but the filmmaker does not completely stack the deck, allowing the audience to ponder the implications along with the film's hero, Ray, as he evaluates his progenitors' dueling beliefs.
 
  If the thought of Queen Victoria speaking Japanese is too much for you, you may prefer the English-language version. Be forewarned, however, that it's approximately a quarter of an hour shorter and is weakened by the cuts. The main characters are more strongly established in the Japanese version, resulting in clearer motivations later.
 
  "Steamboy" never really pops its rivets except in several thrilling action sequences, but the sharp imagery and inventive technology make it worthwhile for animation fans. With its allusions to "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Gone With the Wind," a finale that evokes both "Independence Day" and "The Day After Tomorrow," and plenty of undergrad discourse in the sciences and philosophy, it makes for an oddly endearing mix of pop culture and brain culture.

n this mind-bending, elaborate anime, the industrial era is reimagined as a time of steam-powered aggression, with American capitalists arriving in London on a mission to fool Britannia. Scientists and speculators in the energy racket are eager to display their wares, souped-up steam engines that put awe-inspiring inventions in motion. But the bright ideas of the inventors are eclipsed by the dark drive for profits, and a young British boy named Ray (with the voice of Anna Paquin) slows down the troublemakers on their warpath. The director Katsuhiro Otomo, known for the acclaimed "Akira," comes up with ingenious methods of giving machine-age gadgetry some space-age capabilities. Tubes, for instance, carry voices throughout a building, like a primitive intercom. This entire wedding-cake of a building soon lifts off like a rocket. And like many sci-fi heroes, young Ray enjoys the airborne joy ride on a personal jet pack. The film borrows iconography from various hero quests, with Ray and his dad suffering through a Luke Skywalker-Darth Vader dynamic. Both father and son enjoy the same flirtation with the extreme, the chance to test their inventive powers even when the results veer toward destruction. As a venerable voice of reason, Ray's loin-clothed, oddly muscular grandfather displays hints of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Yoda, E. T. and the good half of Gollum. A misguided tween called Scarlett O'Hara is London's newest arrival, in town to see the Crystal Palace and an exhibition therein. Scarlett is annoying and spoiled, but not completely heartless. As was briefly true of her "Gone With the Wind" namesake, she is aligned with war profiteers, who are slyly manipulating her. The girl is an industrial titan's daughter with a toy-size yap dog, Columbus; the two are an Industrial Revolution equivalent of Paris Hilton with her equally pampered chihuahua, Tinkerbell. Like many a battle in the century to come, a Victorian era conflict is soon fought over fuel - in this instance, "a stable liquid of exceptional purity, found in a cave in Iceland," we are told. Encased in a "steam ball," the substance can power massive airships, which in the wrong hands are havoc-wreakers. This special energy source is that reimagined era's highly enriched uranium - a source of power in physics, economics and geopolitics. Deceptive scientists and engineers toil in a mysterious building owned by the greedy capitalists of the O'Hara Foundation. Dignitaries soon arrive in Arab veils and Teutonic military attire, and robotic storm troopers burst forth for "a little demonstration," as Scarlett's Rasputin-like overseer calls it. But the display is far from harmless. Blood is spilled, glass is shattered and most indecorously of all, the Queen's benediction is interrupted. The film turns into a preposterous but engrossing spectacle, fueled by a resource more enduring than steam or its successors: big ideas. "Steamboy" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes graphic violence in battle scenes and the explosive destruction of London, albeit in cartoon form.

Leading manga and Japanimation writer-helmer Katsuhiro Otomo charcoal-filters his ambivalent attitude toward technology through a complex sci-fi plot set in Victorian England, where steam power has quasi-nuke destructive potential. Pic is being touted as most expensive anime movie ever, and budget shows in every intricate, painstakingly designed frame. The diaspora of anime buffs who revere helmer will ensure healthy opening figures as a niche release. However, dry storytelling and boy's-toys mechanics will stop this from being the next "Spirited Away"-style crossover hit.
In Manchester in 1866, young factory-assistant Ray is the son of Eddie Steam, a scientist abroad working with his father, Lloyd Steam. Grandpa Lloyd sends Ray a mysterious ball in the mail that nefarious agents from the shadowy O'Hara Foundation try to seize. Ray escapes on a one-wheel contraption of his own devising (first of pic's many groovy gizmos), but is captured and whisked by zeppelin to the O'Hara Foundation's pavilion at the not-yet-opened Great Exhibition in London.
Eventually it is revealed that the strange ball is a type of engine using compressed steam of "unbelievable power" invented by Lloyd. Several of these balls run the O'Hara pavilion, which later reveals itself to be an immense, mobile fortress. Deep inside its bowels, Ray discovers both his dad Eddie, who has fallen under the sway of O'Hara, and Grandpa Lloyd who, fearing O'Hara wishes to harness the steam balls' power for evil ends, is trying to foil their plans.
Gramp's suspicions look to be on the money when the O'Hara faction hijacks the opening of the Great Exhibition to turn it into an armament show for potential buyers from nations around the world. Otomo also works in a chaste love interest for Ray in the form of a spoiled little rich girl named, of all things, Scarlett O'Hara, but her role seems a merely cursory concession to young femme auds.
Pic's implicit ideology is consistent with the helmer's pacifist and techno-skeptic principles as displayed in his feature "Akira," short "Cannon Fodder" (in portmanteau pic "Memories"), and the story he penned for Hiroyuki Kitakubo's "Rojin Z."
But Otomo is a Socratic instructor, leaving the aud to make its own mind up like Ray, torn between his dad and his granddad's equally persuasive arguments. Younger viewers may start squirming with boredom during the heavier debates, but there's always another cool piston-powered machine on the way. As a writer, Otomo may fear how technology is used by those in power, but as an artist, he sure loves a good gadget.
Animation is aces, further pushing the possibilities of blending computer-generated 3-D technology with traditional 2-D design. Palette takes its cue from sepia tones of old photographs, washing out the colors and recreating the drab, milky light of British weather very effectively. Character design is a bit conventional compared with the lavish backgrounds.

The most eagerly anticipated anime of the 21st century, Katsuhiro Otomo 's big-budget Steamboy could probably never satisfy hardcore fans of Otomo's 1988 Akira the most vivid action 'toon since the Fleischers' Superman series, as well as the movie that established an American audience for Japanimation. Still, Otomo eludes the legacy of his cult classic with a deftly sidelong knight's move . . . into the past.
Where Akira  more or less established the cyberpunk techno mysticism, flaming urban dystopia, and apocalyptic post-Blade Runner  ambience that continues to dominate sci-fi anime, Steamboy  is deliberately anachronistic in its setting. Otomo has credited novelist William Gibson  as an influence on Akira ; with Steamboy , Otomo executes the same switch pulled by Gibson when he went steampunk with the alt-Victorian 19th century of his 1991 collaboration with Bruce Sterling , The Difference Engine .
Akira 's Neo-Tokyo was a thicket of brooding skyscrapers and enormous vid screens, home to a motley collection of youth gangs, terrorists, gadget-happy military thugs, and psychokinetic mutants. Steamboy 's world is no less techno-driven; indeed, its sense of industrialized nature may be even more redolent of what Frederic Jameson  termed the Hysterical Sublime, except that soot is the new (or rather old) neon. In the opening sequence, the movie feasts on the vista of mid-19th-century Manchester , surrounded by satanic mills and wreathed in the smoke of an encroaching industrial landscape.
Life is near bucolic for little Ray Steam  when a sinister gang of spies invades his parlor and attempts to seize control of the mysterious "steam ball" that is sent to Ray by his inventor grandfather Lloyd. A steam-powered tank attacks the house; a mad railway chase, complete with monstrous dirigible strafing the train, takes Ray to London, where he is kidnapped by the minions of the O'Hara Foundation . This sinister operation's most visible representative is a hilariously imperious little girl known, at least in the movie's dubbed English-language version, as Miss Scarlett.
Steamboy 's narrative, such as it is, has something to do with the O'Haras, a gang of WMD-building, war-profiteering capitalists conspiring to exploit a rival gang of technologically advanced anti-capitalists (you couldn't really call them socialists), including old man Lloyd. Ray's father, Eddie, is on the other side, but the main thing in this boy-centered universe is that all grown-ups are inherently treacherous. More compelling than the plot, of course, is Otomo's animated mise-en-scène. Steamboy  is almost monochromatic in its brown tones. Ubiquitous vapors only accentuate the elaborately detailed background and amusing pastiche of Victorian London.
In any case, the story ceases to matter once events come to a head with maximum pomp and ceremony at the Great Exhibition of All Nations, here transformed by the unscrupulous O'Hara gang into an international arms bazaar. Destruction of the famous Crystal Palace, the 19th-century acme of British modernity, is only part of the collateral damage that's inflicted on London once war breaks out between the local bobbies and the rampaging steam troopers unleashed by the O'Hara mob.
This mayhem, to which the movie devotes most of its second hour, is not without its comic aspectand not just because the actual Great Exhibition was the most documented event of the 19th century. Otomo makes much of British understatement, even as the Thames ices over and central London is destroyed, while giving near equal weight to Miss Scarlett's petulant outbursts. But mainly Steamboy  is about technology. The imaginary steam-powered hardware includes one-man bombers, bathyscaphes, and enough elaborately clanking contraptions to keep the world's plumbers in business for the rest of this century.
Steamboy  doesn't have the deep melancholia or the visionary élan of last year's Ghost in the Shell 2 : Innocence.  Consistent in its graphic invention from first to last, however, it's a sensationally designed piece of work. (The retro stylistics are comparable to Brazil , David Lynch 's Dune , and The Iron Giant .) Steamboy  glosses the most resilient scenario in Japanese pop culture. The movie may be set in the world of David Copperfield  and Little Nell, but it conjures a spectacle of urban destruction worthy of Godzilla .
