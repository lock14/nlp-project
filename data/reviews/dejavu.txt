"D�j� Vu" is a stratospherically high concept action-thriller that has Denzel Washington -- in his umpteenth lawman role -- going back in time to stop a murderer and save hundreds of lives.
As ATF agent Doug Carlin, his most urgent rescue involves a young lovely (Paula Patton) whose dead body washes ashore the same day a terrorist blows up a crowded ferry. Did the terrorist kill her, too? And can Washington, using the latest toys from the Hollywood physics lab, even fit through the rip in the time-space continuum?
You aren't likely to see a more ludicrous movie for the rest of the year. But rarely has such ludicrousness been used to pay tribute to a town in need of love. "D�j� Vu" is generic enough to have been filmed anywhere. But it happens to be set in post-Katrina New Orleans. And, in its own bullet-riddled, pyrotechnic way, the picture feels like a celebration of the city's resilience.
Our dead girl is a vivacious Creole. Doug watches her in footage captured from a satellite surveillance arrangement (don't ask) operated by FBI-sponsored hipster-physicists . He's basically spying on a ghost who stands in for the battered Gulf Coast region.
Granted, this is a Tony Scott picture. So, one could also argue that Doug and the quartet of eggheads (including Val Kilmer and Adam Goldberg) are just watching a woman disrobe and shower and dress herself. But unlike Scott's previous exercises in lurid voyeurism -- "The Last Boy Scout," or last year's "Domino" -- this movie has a knowing laugh about it.
Carlin and the scientists -- one of whom is a woman (Erika Alexander) -- sit in a dark control room similar to the bigger one in Scott's hit surveillance thriller, "Enemy of the State." Occasionally Patton will look into a hidden camera and Washington, whose smile is the movie's secret weapon, gazes at her up on the screen with a moonstruck look. Of course, he has to go back in time: She's cute. Plus, Carlin is miffed to learn that there's more to this satellite business than Kilmer and company let on. (Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio wrote the clever script.)
With hyperactive camerawork and hopscotch editing, the surveillance system doubles as a metaphor for Scott's moviemaking, down to its borderline tastelessness. But the scuzzy, tweaked-out style of Scott's last couple of films -- "Man on Fire" and "Domino," -- isn't as morally appalling as usual.
The opening ferry explosion reeks of poetry, but Scott's directing is on meds in " D�j� Vu," resulting in an action movie that seems slightly human. Scott and his frequent producer, Jerry Bruckheimer, follow Carlin through the movie's wormhole. The character's race against time becomes theirs -- a race to undo all the gratuitous, disturbingly sexy death they've concocted over the decades.
Usually a Scott-Bruckheimer production sends you home wanting a shower. But here they've caught the movie's unstoppable bayou spirit and send you home on a high. Come back, the movie says of New Orleans. Live again.


         Jerry BRUCKHEIMER, the producer-king of mass audience mayhem, is not in the habit of giving his films French titles, but "D�j� Vu" is in the business of confounding expectations.
 
  Rather than the routine Denzel Washington-starring potboiler the advertising indicates, what we've got here is a science fiction thriller that plays like the noir classic "Laura" would if Philip K. Dick had written the screenplay.
 


         






    And though films routinely ask us to suspend disbelief, "D�j� Vu" (literally "already seen") is a film viewers will be hard-pressed to explain to themselves, let alone anyone else. But if the Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio script doesn't make any sense, it does so in such a delirious and energetic way that it's hard not to go along for the ride.
 
  The key notion here, a sci-fi staple for generations, is whether the past is truly past, or whether past, present and future are in some way connected via shortcuts through space and time called wormholes, shortcuts that enable people in the humble present to influence both the past and the future.
 
  When you've got a far-flung premise such as this, it's essential to have a star who grounds the film in everyday reality, and Washington, as always, does that beautifully. An actor with charisma and intelligence to burn, he is someone who never wastes his time, never takes on projects that don't deserve to be made.
 
  Also essential when you're trying to make a film with a plot nobody should be thinking about too hard is a strong director who makes things move at a breakneck clip. A director like Tony Scott.
 
  Deservedly known as one of the best pure shooters in the business, Scott, working with director of photography Paul Cameron and editor Chirs Lebenzon, is expert at filling the screen with so much forward motion that the questions you might otherwise have get left in the dust.
 
  Though Scott has made his share of fiascos, he and Washington form an especially potent combination: Witness 1995's "Crimson Tide" and 2004's "Man on Fire." Adding Bruckheimer's particular brand of showmanship to the mix also helps to take our mind off the sketchiness of some of the plotting.
 
  The Bruckheimer touch is most evident at the start of "D�j� Vu" when a terrorist bomb explodes on a New Orleans ferry, sending terrifying black and red flames 350 feet in the air and causing the deaths of 543 people.
 
  Called in to investigate is Doug Carlin (Washington), of the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, a man who knows more about explosives than Alfred Nobel and looks better in sunglasses than any government employee has a right to.
 
  One of the elements that catches Doug's eye is the fact that the body of a beautiful young woman who clearly died of blast injuries was recovered before the blast went off. This has the markings, he says, of "a unique and complicated crime scene." He has no idea.
 
  Doug's expertise catches the eye of FBI agent Andrew Pryzwarra (a hefty Val Kilmer), who pulls him in to take part in a top-secret project run by bearded and brainy Dr. Alexander Denny (Adam Goldberg). Said project, Doug is told, involves digitally re-creating the past through surveillance cameras, a re-creation that is always four days and six hours behind the present or, as the good doctor puts it, "a single trailing moment of now."
 
  At Doug's suggestion, the project focuses on that mysterious young blast victim, Claire Kuchever (Paula Patton). Because Claire is a knockout, and because she just happens to spend much of her time in her underwear and/or the shower, Doug finds himself falling in love with her just like Dana Andrews did with the portrait of the dead Gene Tierney in "Laura."
 
  But guess what? That picture of the past may not be just a picture after all but something more malleable, which is where "D�j� Vu" already complicated plot really floats out of the realm of easy comprehension. For despite consulting with what press material call "the mega-sized brains of several world-class physicists," this film takes turns that are truly hard to understand.
 
  What is interesting is not how little sense "D�j� Vu" makes but how little that matters. If you want your films to add up logically, you're welcome to take your calculator somewhere else. But if you do, you will be missing out on some first-class genre fun.
 
 
  MPAA rating: PG-13. Running time 2 hours, 6 minutes.   

The first thing I didn't believe about Déjà Vu , the latest package of combustible goods from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Tony Scott, was the shamelessness of the filmmakers. Scott, a man of famously well-oiled visual facility, squeezes every bit of crackerjack dread he can out of the sunny New Orleans ferry ride that opens the film, crosscutting like a Madison Avenue Hitchcock between a pack of partying sailors and the level below them, where the Beach Boys' ''Don't Worry, Baby,'' floating out of a parked car's radio, becomes the lovely counterpoint toâ€¦a bomb blast that blows everyone on board to smithereens. Scott and Bruckheimer must think they're making a ''relevant'' thriller: Terrorism! Half-burned bodies falling to their deaths! In New Orleans! All I could think was, this is what it looks like when tragedy is shoved into the Hollywood exploitation compactor.
Then again, maybe I'm taking it all too seriously. Déjà Vu  has a smear of topical frosting, but it's really a solemnly preposterous time-warp surveillance thriller. The movie manages the singular feat of placing a science-fiction premise in a realistic setting, only to render that premise even more far-fetched than it would have seemed otherwise. Arriving on the scene, Denzel Washington, as ATF agent Doug Carlin (please, Denzel is so  not a Doug  which accounts, perhaps, for his generic performance), is led to a chamber jammed with caffeinated tech types, like jittery Adam Goldberg, and sprawling video screens. It's there he discovers the brave new frontier of digital surveillance. Using footage from four different satellites, the dweeb geniuses of government security interpolate the footage with computers, which allows them to present a full-on ''movie'' of any setting from any angle, with the ability to go behind any closed doors. Here's the catch: The image synthesis is so complicated that it can't be replayed  they have to just let it run. Thus, there's but one fleeting chance to glimpse the terrorist.
Are you buying any of this? Déjà Vu  rips off Minority Report , with echoes of Blow Out  and the virtual-reality thrillers of the early '90s, and one's eagerness to roll with it gets tested the moment the surveillance begins to poke around the house of Claire (Paula Patton), a beauty whose singed body was fished out of the water after the ferry blast. Denzel gawks at her image and falls in love with her, but the cheesy blend of voyeurism and ''romance'' is a bit unseemly considering that he's investigating the deaths of 543 people. Besides, it's not as if he can change the past. Actually, scratch that. In Déjà Vu , you can  change the past, as Carlin ''enters'' the four-day-old surveillance footage, hurtling down highways to play rewind with reality. In doing so, he attempts to thwart the terrorist, played with been-there-bombed-that creepiness by Jim Caviezel as a gloss on Timothy McVeigh (how convenient it wasn't al-Qaeda). Déjà Vu  is watchable trash, meticulously edited in Scott's skip-stutter style, but there's something ultimately unsatisfying about a thriller that more or less makes up its rules as it goes along.

 In the cinema of big bangs, few bangs are bigger than those generated by the producer Jerry Bruckheimer. That’s especially true when this influential hitmaker (his small-screen credits include the “CSI” franchise) teams up with the film director Tony Scott, with whom he has made six blockbusters, including the 1980s pop sensation “Top Gun.” Now comes “Déjà Vu,” an action flick with Denzel Washington in which the gaudy pyrotechnics are nowhere near as jaw-dropping as the screenplay that name-checks not one, not two, but three national tragedies against a backdrop of red blood, white uniforms and blue-sky improbability.  It doesn’t take long before the filmmakers uncork their signature move and blow something up. In this case, that something is:  the 543 men, women and children, including hundreds of sailors who, having gathered aboard an enormous New Orleans ferry, are blown to pieces almost as it pushes off. One minute a grandfatherly type in a veteran’s cap is sitting with a small child in his lap; the next, a sailor is soaring through the air, his snowy white uniform cutting a stark picture against the fiery orange backdrop. At once awesome and absurd, the explosion doesn’t just rip bodies discreetly apart but also shreds the film, because nothing else in “Déjà Vu” has been created with such loving attention to detail.  The dead have just started to be stacked up on the pier when Mr. Washington rolls up as Doug Carlin, an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Graced with almost uncanny powers of detection, Doug is the kind of investigator who sniffs the air, sifts the earth and all but walks on water to determine who did what, where, when and why. Standing on the banks of the Mississippi amid the carefully scattered wreckage, not a severed body part in view, he zeroes in on a speck of evidence that would have led straight to the killer if the credited screenwriters, Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio, hadn’t decided to kink up their terrorism plot with a beautiful dead woman and some nutty speculative fiction.  Fantasists of a specific Hollywood kind, Mr. Bruckheimer and Mr. Scott rarely traffic in reality, even when they seem to want to. “Déjà Vu” is more removed from reality than most of their collaborations, which makes their exploitation of Sept. 11, Katrina and Oklahoma City (which earns a couple of vague mentions) less offensive than it might in a film that bore some relation to the real world. Yet “Déjà Vu” is so wildly divorced from the here and the now of contemporary politics, policy and people that it’s impossible to get worked up by its invocation of these three calamities, though a throwaway shot of a decimated New Orleans neighborhood used purely for some atmospheric flavoring is certainly vulgar in the extreme.  Of course, vulgarity is part of the appeal of both a Jerry Bruckheimer film and a Tony Scott film, which exist purely for an evening’s entertainment, for loud noises and flashy pictures, big stars and fast action, violence and yet more violence. Like all their partnerships, “Déjà Vu” has been calibrated for minimum thought and maximum diversion; too bad that, unlike “Enemy of the State,” by far the smartest and slickest of their joint efforts, this new film falls so perilously short. The joke of it is, for all the pricey bangs and booms, the whiplash cinematography and the editing that turns film space into cubistic tableaux, a Bruckheimer-and-Scott partnership is only as good as its screenplay, and this one is a mess.  It’s also preposterous, even by the standards of the pulpiest speculative fiction. After Doug retrieves that crucial speck of evidence, which he delivers to the other shocked and awed law enforcement types working the case, he uncovers far more attractive evidence in the form of an apparent bomb victim, Claire (Paula Patton). For the unattached and all-but-friendless agent, the dead woman, who looks good even when stretched out on an autopsy table, becomes the key that unlocks the case and his heart. Like the detective in Otto Preminger’s classic film noir “Laura” who falls for a  woman he knows only through a portrait and other traces, Doug falls hard, though without the benefit of some memorable David Raksin theme music to cushion him.  In “Laura,” the detective solves the case with hard work and shoe leather. Doug tackles his job with hardware and hooey, which means he gets to the bottom of things —  or, rather, hops a ride back into the past on the space-time continuum with some help from Val Kilmer (as a federal agent), Adam Goldberg (as a genius), a yellow Hummer and a room stuffed with blinking machines and flat screens that make the image we’re watching look remarkably like a big computer monitor with several open software windows. To top it off, Jim Caviezel even shows up wearing the same  military jacket that Robert De Niro wore in “Taxi Driver” and spouting religious-sounding verse, adding a delirious soupçon of Mel Gibson-style passion to a film that has long  lost its way.  “Déjà Vu” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The violence is more suggestive than graphic.

A wrinkle in time gives texture and cinematic power to Tony Scott's exquisitely rendered "Deja Vu." The deliberate explosion of a New Orleans ferry carrying hundreds of U.S. sailors triggers what at first looks like the ultimate "CSI" episode care of producer Jerry Bruckheimer. But time-bending and tense-switching dimensions send "Deja Vu" to the level of an existential sci-fi thriller sure to elicit post-screening discussions and a fine holiday take.
Third match of Scott and star Denzel Washington ("Crimson Tide," "Man on Fire") is the least overtly dramatic but the most resonant, with the duo giving solidity to a concept that would fly apart in less sure hands. Scott understands filmmaking as well as any Hollywood helmer and easily connects with Washington, with both aspects wedded here to rewarding ends.
Opening nine minutes comprise a wordless montage of sailors and their families enjoying Mardi Gras on a New Orleans river ferry, followed by an enormous bomb blast that sends bodies and cars into the river. Even by Bruckheimer standards, this is one mother of a fireball, realistically staged.
ATF agent Doug Carlin (Washington), a vet of the Oklahoma City attack, meticulously investigates the massive crime scene, which involves 543 victims. He links the bomber to a woman named Claire (Paula Patton), whose body was found some distance from the bombing before the attack itself.
Figuring that Claire had some connection to the bomber, Carlin examines her home and is stunned to hear himself on her answering machine.
He's in for a bigger surprise from FBI agent Pryzwarra (Val Kilmer), working under straight-laced lead investigator Jack McCready (Bruce Greenwood). Spotting Carlin's skills, Pryzwarra introduces him to a team of techies who have apparently developed software that can digitally re-create images from four days earlier. With their nifty tools and visuals, scientists Denny (Adam Goldberg), Gunnars (Elden Henson) and Shanti (Erika Alexander) are able to scan Claire at home prior to the tragedy.
Sequences in the so-called "time-window" lab suggest the scope of surveillance on private lives, as well as serving up a dazzling metaphysical lightshow in which Carlin becomes the aud's surrogate, pondering the reality of what he's seeing. The lab's work pushes the story into the realm of string theory, wormholes, Einstein and the "folding" of time. What Carlin sees is in fact the recent past "bridged" to the present.
In a visually inventive, mind-twisting chase, Carlin tracks the bomber, ID'd as Carroll Oerstadt (Jim Caviezel), simultaneously in the present and four days prior by using a "time-window" portable viewfinder device.
Cinema's natural felicities for time and action have seldom felt as beautifully dovetailed. And even when the plot in Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio's script begins to push plausibility, it stays grounded in Washington's emotional drive as Carlin to rescue Claire from a death that seems to be her destiny.
Kilmer and Greenwood are in fairly perfunctory "CSI"-like roles, but Patton is allowed a fascinating range as a single woman first viewed from a distance of time and space and, later, close up. Caviezel is pure right-wing malevolence in a role that counters his usually beatific countenance.
Pic is a technical marvel at the highest level, with Scott regulars (including lenser Paul Cameron, editor Chris Lebenzon and production designer Chris Seagers) operating at full, imaginative throttle. Tech heads will buzz about lab sequences for weeks afterward. Big Easy locales, filmed post-Katrina, are lavishly used.

OK, so Jerry Bruckheimer  and Tony Scott  were asking for it by naming their latest mega-production Déjà Vu . These dudes aren't exactly paragons of innovation, unless taking rhetorical hysteria to awesome new heights counts. As the opening credits rollby which of course I mean roll, zip, flicker, fade, zoom, and swerveyou get a good solid smack of the Tony Scott touch. The man never met a strobe cut, filter effect, or inexplicable helicopter shot he didn't love, and love to inflict on the humblest scene. In this case, it's the boarding of passengers on the Alvin Stumpf Ferry , sailors and kiddies and cute ol' grandpa heading across the Mississippi River  for Mardi Gras in New Orleans. Given the way they've been sliced and diced in editing, you'd think they must have plunged into some gnarly vortex of the space-time continuum. We'll be getting to that.
So yeah, Déjà Vu :  You've seen it all before. Take that, billionaire losers! Except you haven't quite. Déjà Vu  isn't as sleek a genre pleasure as Enemy of the State , but it does have a freaky little trick up its sleeve. The story goes like this: The ferry blows up (seen it), Denzel Washington  struts on the scene to investigate (seen it), clues are discovered (seen it), a dead girl is found under mysterious circumstances (seen it), Val Kilmer  arrives looking kind of pudgy ( . . . ), everyone heads off to a top-secret government base and climbs into a gigantic spark plug. There, joined by the usual group of wiseass technicians, they begin to retrace events with the help of Snow White, a next-level surveillance system linked up, naturally, to seven satellites. The console renders real-time composite images of anything that happened four days ago, from any angle, through all obstacles, and in the visual vocabulary of the 21st-century blockbuster. Except that actually it's a time machine. (Now here is something new.)
It's at this point in an otherwise routine techno-thriller that Déjà Vu  takes a delirious turn into what might generously be called preposterous sci-fi gobbledygook, but just as accurately described as the most unexpected essay on movie metaphysics ever plunked down in the middle of a Hollywood  blockbuster. Hunched over Snow White, ATF stud Doug Carlin  (Washington) and FBI agent  Andrew Pryzwarra  (Kilmer) cyber-stalk the exceedingly lovely Claire Kuchever  (Paula Patton ), their only lead in the case. As they snoop around her apartment, jiggling controllers like God on an Xbox , the tech heads discourse on the nature of their toy. Space, you see, can be folded in half, like a sheet of paper. With the proper optics and enough electricity to power the Eastern Seaboard you can create a wormhole, a sort of bridge, and on the other side of the bridge is the past. Or whatever. Point is, during all this pseudo-scientific yip yap, we've been watching characters in a movie watch characters in a movie of their own direction. It doesn't take a double major in quantum physics and cinema studies to realize that time travel in Déjà Vu  is precisely the concept of movies themselves. Space folded in half: the space of the screen and the space of the things dancing upon it. Snow White is a screen into the past, and what film isn't?
Of course Scott and his screenwriters (Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio) are less interested in concepts to explore than high-concept gimmickry. But why complain when it results in a car chase that simultaneously blows shit up on two different time planes? Bruckheimer's more-is-more ethos may well have reached a theoretical limit. As for Scott, he heads into the third act with relative restraint, sending Carlin to hunt down a disgruntled patriot (Jim Caviezel ) who killed 500 sailors because, you know, the government sucks and stuff. Scott wouldn't know subtext if it rose out of the bayou and ripped off his arm, but that doesn't stop him from sprinkling on references to Katrina  (Déjà Vu , the first film shot in post-Katrina New Orleans, makes an emphatic if unnecessary point of staging a big scene in the ruins of the Ninth Ward), domestic terrorism, and Iraq . So Déjà Vu  reinvents itself once more as a time-travel romance meets anti-terrorist action flick. Had Scott kept going with this batty projectthere's a musical and a dinosaur picture in here somewhereI'd have followed him all the way.
