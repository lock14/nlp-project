In the movies, ''the suburbs'' are never just a place. They're a state of mind, a mythology we all know in our bones. The myth goes something like this: The suburbs are comfortable, maybe even beautiful, but their serenity is rooted in a friendly American conformity, so that the people who live there have to repress their true selves, which will emerge when they drink too much and have affairs, or rage at each other for their dishonesty, which was all caused in the first place by...the suburbs.
The best thing about Revolutionary Road , a cool-blooded and disquieting adaptation of Richard Yates' 1961 novel about a powerfully unhappy Connecticut couple, is that it doesn't  end with that rote vision of bourgeois anomie. It only begins there. Frank and April Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio  and Kate Winslet ) are about 30, with two kids, and both believe they can evade the traps of the existence they've chosen. The year is 1955, and Frank has a New York job that bores him, marketing business machines. He takes solace in feeling superior to his work, and also in his midday martinis and occasional dip into the secretarial pool. April, meanwhile, wanted to be an actress, and still feels she's meant for higher things.
Moved to reach for something more, April comes up with a plan: She and Frank will sell their home and move to Paris, where she'll work as a government secretary and he will...find himself. (It's like a '60s fantasy a decade ahead of time.) Revolutionary Road  was directed by Sam Mendes , who made the glibly scathing American Beauty  , only here he wants us to share not just Frank and April's misery but the frail reveries that hold them together. The escape-to-Paris idea is naive, impractical  a pipe dream. Yet it's fueled by something Mendes captures about the '50s, an era when people often had deep imaginative sparks that exceeded their ability to voice them. Winslet has the tricky job of making us see the glimmer of wisdom in April's cockeyed plan, and she pulls it off, even as DiCaprio's Frank  chipper, forthright, wholesome even in betrayal  tugs the couple back to reality.
Revolutionary Road  has deception, adultery, operatic shouting, the then-forbidden specter of abortion, and a few scenes that spotlight the remarkable performance of Michael Shannon as John Givings, a mathematician who's been hospitalized for insanity, and who proves how unfit for society he is by making every acid comment cut to the truths that no one else will speak. The film is lavishly dark  some might say too dark  yet I'd suggest it has a different limitation: For all its shattering domestic discord, there's something remote and aestheticized about it. April brings a private well of conflict to her middle-class prison, but Winslet is so meticulous in her telegraphed despair that she intrigues us, moves us, yet never quite touches our unguarded nerves.

 There is a lot of jittery cigarette smoking and sloshed-down booze in “Revolutionary Road,” a waxworks edition of the corrosive, furiously unsentimental novel by Richard Yates about an unhappy marriage. Set in the lonely-crowd milieu of 1955, though published in 1961, the novel tracks the  unraveling of Frank and April Wheeler, a handsome young couple who have been trying and failing to keep disappointment at bay by pretending that, despite their suburban address  —  despite a life calibrated to the commuter rail schedule, their two small children, well-stocked bar and picture window that looks over a front lawn as manicured as a cemetery  — they are not like everyone else.  Frank and April  —  Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in the film  —  are crippled by their own acute self-consciousness and their sense that they are superior to the excruciating banality they have fallen into. Fantasies about what Frank calls his “own exceptional merit” haunt the couple, a delusion they cling to like a lifeline and that registers as mutual neurosis and a symptom of some vague, larger social ill. They don’t have much sympathy for each other, and Yates has next to none, though by the time his sad, sad book reaches its terrible, jolting climax, the emotion you will probably feel most acutely is pity, for the Wheelers and perhaps even for the man who has brought them to such merciless life.  Nothing much happens in the story, just two ordinary lives coming apart at the seams. Like the novel, the film begins with a disastrous community theater production of “The Petrified Forest” in which April has the lead female role as the greasy-spoon waitress who dreams of going to France. The play is a flop, but instead of shrugging it off with a laugh as do their next-door neighbors Milly and Shep (Kathryn Hahn and David Harbour), the Wheelers embrace the failure. They drink it in deeply and let it fill them up and then, fortified by it, start hurtling insults at each other, turning the modest public embarrassment of a local play gone wrong into an affirmation of their mutual contempt and loathing.  Things continue to fall apart as Frank shuffles between the traps of office and home, and briefly into the arms of another woman (Zoe Kazan). There’s a short, sweet reprieve when, out of the blue, April decides that the only escape for her and Frank is to pack up the kids and move to Paris, where, she insists, he will at long last be able to find himself and become the man she desperately wants him to be. Paris will be their way out of suburbia and the ticky-tacky little box on a hillside on that cruelly named street, Revolutionary Road. But it’s also clear from the deadening claustrophobia of Sam Mendes’s visual style and the pounding monotony of Thomas Newman’s score that their exit is blocked.  “Revolutionary Road” is the kind of great novel that Hollywood tends to botch, because much of it takes place inside the heads of its characters, and because the Wheelers aren’t especially likeable and  because pessimism without obvious redemption is a tough sell. It’s hard to think of many directors who could do it justice: Nicholas Ray, who in films like “On Dangerous Ground” and “In a Lonely Place” conveys an intimate acquaintance with twinned despair and self-loathing, might have made it work, and perhaps Paul Thomas Anderson. Mr. Mendes, a British theater director and occasional dabbler in the movies —  “American Beauty,” “Road to Perdition,” “Jarhead”  —  seems like a bad choice to take on “Revolutionary Road,” though not because of a lack of talent.  Certainly there’s no shortage of talent in the movie, which displays all the fastidious attention to detail  —  the sack suits that seem to be swallowing Frank whole, the touches of Danish modern in the Wheeler living room  —  you expect from this kind of prestige production. Mr. Mendes himself is a prestige number, of course, as are the two appealing stars, who shed a great deal of sweat and tears trying to put across their characters. They enter the story with their fists in the air, and it isn’t long before they’re slugging away at each other, absorbing low blows and landing brutal hits, which they continue to do to the bitter end, in between angry, accusatory speeches about the lousiness of their lives.  If those blows don’t resonate, it’s largely because Mr. Mendes’s investment in this story feels professional, diagnostic. Part of what makes the novel so powerful, beyond its familiar American theme of self-discovery, is its unwavering fury and how each intimate and acid word feels personal, as if Yates had dredged them up from some place deep inside his own being. No one gets off the hook in “Revolutionary Road,” least of all its author, whose insistence on stripping his characters down to the marrow is so relentless it can’t help but feel like an act of self-flagellation. As a film director, at least, Mr. Mendes comes across as too coolly diffident for that kind of blazing heat. He keeps his distance.  Mr. DiCaprio closes that distance in a few scenes in which you see Frank’s fear  —  of failure and of success too — mixing in with his vanity: with his wide, uncertain, panicked face he shows you what a dreamer without a dream looks like. Ms. Winslet, who’s married to Mr. Mendes, has a tougher time with April, who comes across as something of a noble sufferer when, as a minor character (a memorable Michael Shannon) cannily intuits, she has always played an active part in the Wheeler Family Tragedy. Mr. Mendes stages this tragedy grandly, symbolically  —  in one scene he places April and Frank in front of their car headlights to emphasize that they’re playing a role  —  forgetting that this isn’t just theater, but also something like life.  “Revolutionary Road” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) Adult words and traumas. 

"Revolutionary Road" is a very good bigscreen adaptation of an outstanding American novel -- faithful, intelligent, admirably acted, superbly shot. It also offers a near-perfect case study of the ways in which film is incapable of capturing certain crucial literary qualities, in this case the very things that elevate the book from being a merely insightful study of a deteriorating marriage into a remarkable one. Sam Mendes' fourth feature reps what many people look for in the realm of serious, grown-up, thoughtful film fare and, led by the powerful performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, teaming for the first time since "Titanic," Paramount Vantage should be able to push this sad tale to a potent commercial career among discriminating audiences.
In addition to being compared with Richard Yates' 1961 novel, which thwarted previous aspiring adapters and has enjoyed a persistent following over the years, the film will conjure up two other comparisons -- to the TV series "Mad Men," which is set in the same general period and shares a focus on hard-smoking, hard-drinking New York commuters and their women, and Mendes' own "American Beauty," a similarly critical but far more theatrical look at the underside of the suburban American dream.
Screenplay by Justin Haythe ("The Clearing") scrupulously adheres to the structure, personalities, perspectives and much of the dialogue of the novel as it examines the heartbreaking schism in the relationship between Frank and April Wheeler (DiCaprio and Winslet), a strikingly handsome couple who buy into the postwar convention of abandoning the city and raising two kids in a picture-perfect Connecticut suburb while Frank commutes to his unchallenging job at a large business-machines corporation in Manhattan.
Stuck at home, and with the far more acute set of emotional antennae, April is the first to identify the "trap" of their lives, and soon proposes they chuck it all and move to Paris, where she proposes to support the family while Frank endeavors to find himself. "This is our one chance," April stresses, and it doesn't take long for Frank, who would seem to have a latent bohemian in him, to agree. Questioned as to why they'd want to make such a drastic move, Frank replies, with a glancing hint of ironic humor, "We're running from the hopeless emptiness of the life here."
Literature, movies and social commentary have all been down this road many times before, stressing the conformism of '50s upper-middle-class life, the emotional sterility of the suburbs, the hypocrisy of attitudes, the sexism, et al. What keeps all these too routinely accepted views safely in the background here is the stinging emotional truth that courses through the novel and, to a significant extent, the film, thanks especially to the electric, fully invested performances by the two leads. Frank and April are like a 20-years-younger George and Martha in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" who have yet to achieve an unstated equilibrium in their epic tug of war.
One youthful advantage they still enjoy is a simmering amorous relationship. Sad to say, this doesn't prevent Frank from having an office fling with a very available secretary, Maureen (Zoe Kazan), as a 30th birthday present to himself. Incidental as the interlude is, the brief affair serves as a cogent illustration of how the film conveys only a fraction of the nuances and layers of the book.
In the film, it appears Frank makes his move on an almost arbitrary impulse, and he's made to look bad in the typically chauvinistic way he uses his superior position to seduce a powerless young woman. On the page, the two already have a history marked by a long mutual flirtation, and Maureen is described as sexier and less frumpy than the woman who turns up onscreen. Frank may be a cad either way, but in the novel, his cheating involves an array of ambiguous feelings on both sides -- anticipation, hesitation, delight, remorse, Frank's subsequent temptation to confess -- while in the film it registers only one meaning: naughty boy.
With one notable exception toward the end, Haythe and Mendes capture the primal emotional and thematic points of the book as they try to find a cinematic way to express the subtext of Yates' prose, which most distinguishes itself through the precise expressions of minute changes in emotion, attitude and thought -- what might he say, what should she say, what does he feel, what's she really thinking, how did he and she react at the same moment? Even when the dramatic temperature is cranked up to high, the picture's underpinnings seem only partly present, to the point where one suspects that what it's reaching for dramatically might be all but unattainable -- perhaps approachable only by Pinter at his peak.
That said, "Revolutionary Road" is constantly engrossing, as it successfully engages the Wheelers' yearning to rescue themselves from their decorous, socially acceptable oblivion, just as it clearly defines how the "trap" is stronger than they are. The rows, tender moments and downtime in between are fully inhabited and powerfully charged by DiCaprio and Winslet. For his part, DiCaprio often achieves the kind of double register the film as a whole less consistently captures, as he indicates Frank's thought process in the split second before he decides what to say. At certain moments, the conjoined cerebral and emotional aspects of his characterization summon the spirit of Jack Nicholson's breakthrough performances around the time of "Five Easy Pieces."
Winslet's perf is less surprising, perhaps, if only because she has shown tremendous range throughout her career. April is a difficult role in that her mood changes sometimes seem inexplicable, but the thesp makes them all seem genuine, which resonates with Frank's occasional hints that she's possibly in need of psychiatric help. Winslet's starkly etched April is steely, strong and brittle, capable of great highs and lows as well as massive uncertainty.
Pic's startling supporting turn comes from Michael Shannon, who's mesmerizing as the clinically insane son of local realtor and busybody Helen Givings (Kathy Bates). He's a loony who is able to tell the truth about the Wheelers that everyone else so politely avoids; when Shannon is onscreen, it's impossible to watch anyone else. The limited roster of supporting players has been expertly cast, and the thesps deliver accordingly, notably Bates, Richard Easton as her conveniently hard-of-hearing husband and David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn as the Wheeler's small-horizons neighbors.
Kristi Zea's production design meshes with location work in Connecticut and Gotham to produce a vivid but unstressed sense of 1955. As ever, cinematographer Roger Deakins makes everyone -- the designers, actors, director, gardener, manicurist, you name it -- look even better than they do on their own. Thomas Newman's score, defined as it is by very simple three-note progressions, plays into the desired mood but grows repetitive.

No writer ever gazed deeper or more despairingly into the prison of middle-class American conformity than Richard Yates , which may explain why none of his books sold more than 12,000 copies in his lifetime and why it's taken more than 40 years for one of them to reach the big screen. It is said that we go to the movies for escapism, after all, and Yates's great subject was the very thing many of us seek to escape—namely, the lives of prefabricated mediocrity we settle for when personal ambition yields to the desire to be "just like everyone else." Decades before divorce lawyers and prescription pharmaceuticals became convenient panaceas for all that ails us, Yates (1926–1992) pulled back the curtain on Auden's "Age of Anxiety" and found that the plasticine dream of suburban bliss was something closer to a waking nightmare.
So there's a wonderfully perverse irony in the fact that the film version of Yates's first and most lauded novel, Revolutionary Road , stars Leonardo DiCaprio  and Kate Winslet —the very actors who defined everlasting movie romance for an entire generation of filmgoers as the star-crossed lovers in James Cameron 's Titanic . Here, Kate and Leo once again strive to keep their heads above water, gasping for air. Only, in Revolutionary Road , the sinking ship pulling them down is their own marriage.
Like many of Yates's characters, Frank and April Wheeler  appear to be the most average of postwar average Americans—he a mid-level worker bee for the same New York corporation where his father eked out an anonymous existence; she a stay-at-home mother of two with a well-kept home in a tree-lined corner of Connecticut. But it wasn't so long ago that Frank was a combat vet turned Lower Manhattan bon vivant—"an intense, nicotine-stained Jean-Paul Sartre  sort of man," Yates writes—and April was a young starlet who fell under his worldly spell. And despite their newfound comfort and prosperity, they have both held on to this memory of earlier times and used it to convince themselves that they were once "interesting" people and could be so again. Deep down, they know that this life of suburban anonymity isn't for them. Deeper down, they fear they may be wrong.
In what may be a last-ditch attempt to save themselves, April makes an inspired proposal: Why don't they just pack it all in and move to Paris, where she'll take a job and Frank will be free to . . . well, to "find himself." And for a while, the Wheelers' escape plan buoys them and gives them even greater contempt for the pettiness—the "hopeless emptiness," as Frank memorably terms it—of everything around them. Until, that is, April gets the news that sends their can't-miss plan on a collision course with a metaphorical iceberg.
Directed by Sam Mendes  from a scrupulously faithful adaptation by Justin Haythe , Revolutionary Road  isn't a great movie—it lacks the full, soul-crushing force of the novel—but what works in it works so well, and is so tricky to pull off, that you can't help but admire it. By no means an easy candidate for adaptation, Yates dwells in the shadow area between people's conscious and subconscious selves, between the faces they show to the world (and even their spouses) and the ones they see when they look in the bedroom mirror at night. To fully grasp Revolutionary Road  is to understand that two people can be at their most alone when they are together—and Mendes, whose American Beauty  rendered a similar investigation of suburban anomie as a gallery of over-the-top comic grotesques, willingly goes there. Where the earlier movie was easy to brush off, this one gets under your skin: It is to Mendes's great credit that Revolutionary Road  will likely lead to some tense moments between many a young couple on their drive home from the cinema.
Some will quibble that Kate and Leo are too glamorous to convincingly portray the dream-deferred middle class, but it's essential to Revolutionary Road  that Frank and April come across as the sort of ordinary people other ordinary people envy, and in that respect, the casting is spot-on. As Winslet has already demonstrated once this season (in The Reader ), among her seemingly boundless gifts is an acute grasp of bright young women beset by some intractable inner torment. DiCaprio, meanwhile, plays Frank with the faintly emasculated authority of so many outgoing, well-bred young men who still haunt the corridors of corporate America. But the movie's one stroke of real genius arrives in the form of the tall, jittery character actor Michael Shannon , who shows up for two scenes as the paranoid schizophrenic son of the Wheelers' matronly real estate agent (Kathy Bates ). Brought to meet Frank and April as part of his attempted re-entry into society, he recognizes the unhappy couple as some kind of fellow travelers, and Yates (who himself spent time in various "bughouses") imparts to him the story's most resonant observation: "Plenty of people are on to the emptiness, but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."
