Given the current bull market in all things Jane Austen, it was inevitable that spinoffs would appear. In addition to the much-praised 2005 Keira Knightley "Pride & Prejudice" and the announcement that "Masterpiece Theatre" will soon tackle the entire Austen oeuvre, the 2004 novel "The Jane Austen Book Club" is on its way to the big screen. Titles like "Jane Austen's Guide to Good Manners" crowd store shelves, and you can buy a Jane Austen action figure on Amazon
. A McDonald's
 "Ironic Meal" is probably in the works.
Which means it's time for a movie about
 Jane Austen: "Becoming Jane," starring Anne Hathaway as a young and ardent Hampshire lass quietly honing her art. Directed by Julian Jarrold ("Kinky Boots"), it falls squarely in the "Shakespeare in Love" genre, taking us behind closed doors with the great figures of literature. It's not bad, either -- lushly mounted, well played, pleasing to the eye and ear. Girls (and other people) who like the Austen movies and miniseries but haven't yet progressed to the novels will love it. But it's not Jane.
The conceit of Kevin Hood and Sarah Williams's screenplay is that all the elements of "Pride and Prejudice" were there in Austen's early life, ready to be transmuted into finely-spun gold. Jane's mother (Julie Walters) is a fusspot obsessed with marrying her daughters up the social ladder; father (James Cromwell) is a daydreamer better at emotional support than financial. A clumsy, lovestruck divinity student (Leo Bill) is a template for Mr. Collins. A wealthy grande dame (Maggie Smith) will become Lady Catherine de Bourgh. At times, "Becoming Jane" seems less homage than outright remake.
On top of all this literary influencing the movie lays a romance with a Darcy prototype. An arrogant young London barrister named Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy) visits the Austen household -- he's a friend of Jane's rakish soldier brother Henry (Joe Anderson) -- and scorns the girl's attempts at writing. (For good reason; the tribute Jane reads at her sister's engagement party is wordy and twee.) A meeting in the woods stiffens the pair's backs further. In Austen-land that can only mean love is around the next piece of topiary.
We know, of course, that Austen never married, and historical evidence of a romance with the real Lefroy is scanty and inconclusive. Anyway, by casting McAvoy the movie can't help but set Jane up for disappointment; the star of "The Last King of Scotland" does charming blue-eyed spinelessness better than any young actor out there.
Instead, the drama in "Becoming Jane" lies in watching the heroine separate her romantic dreams from her artistic ambitions, growing more sure of herself with each step. "Do I detect in you irony
?!" thunders Tom's guardian, a wattle-shaking old judge played by Ian Richardson. "It is my belief that irony is an insult with a smiling face." Responds Jane, "No, irony is two contradictory truths brought together to make a new truth." You go, girl. High school English teachers everywhere thank you.
The scene with the most tender meat on it is Jane's encounter with Ann Radcliffe (Helen McCrory), during which the young writer sits at the feet of the successful novelist and absorbs wisdom like a sponge. Here the risks of what Austen hopes to accomplish become apparent. "To have a wife with a mind is considered not quite proper," Radcliffe warns Tom. "To have a wife with a literary reputation is nothing short of scandalous."
All this is deeply pleasing in a connect-the-literary-dots manner, yet something is missing, and it's Austen's own voice: watchful, wise, and clear as a country stream. Open any of her novels and knowingness lifts off the page, expanding far beyond the narrow drama of social status and betrothal. Here's a sentence chosen at random from "Sense and Sensibility": "Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted." The economy is startling, compacting observations about class and gender and human nature into 26 graceful words.
Anne Hathaway's Jane is headstrong and clever, balanced and true, but you never sense that restless observation -- the constant seeing what others miss -- that's present in every word Austen wrote. "Becoming Jane" is astute enough to recognize that art can make up for the failings of life ("Will all your stories have happy endings?" Jane is asked toward the end, and we all know the answer to that), but the movie makes the understandable mistake of treating the artist as one of her own creations. It's an appealing notion. All you have to do to outgrow it is read.


         The actress Anne Hathaway may someday fulfill her costume biopic destiny by assuming the role of her literary namesake, Shakespeare's wife, but in "Becoming Jane," she takes on the far more daunting task of playing Jane Austen. Few writers enjoy a following as loyal or fervid or frankly well-organized as Austen's, and it's hard to imagine her fans not coming after "Becoming Jane" director Julian Jarrold and screenwriters Sarah Williams and Kevin Hood with pitchforks and torches, or at the very least a letter-writing campaign.
 
  Loosely based on Jon Spence's biography "Becoming Jane Austen," their imaginative version of the beloved author's life seizes on Spence's theory that Austen may have once been in love with a young Irish law student named Tom Lefroy and basically goes to town with it. The film is a work of fiction -- the press materials make this abundantly clear, mostly through the liberal use of italics (the film was inspired by "the possibility
 of a fervid romance" and "the thrilling notion 
of Jane Austen in the middle of her own heated, rebellious love story," etc., etc.) -- but as such it's neither very original nor very convincing. "Shakespeare in Love" did something similar by casting its writer protagonist as the hero of a story he himself might have written, but "Becoming Jane" lacks that movie's wit and playfulness.
 


         






   For one thing, the film's characters line up so neatly with Austen's characters that they can't help but come off as impostors. Mr. And Mrs. Austen, played by James Cromwell and Julie Walters, echo Mr. and Mrs. Bennett's indulgent papa and mother goose routine, down to Mrs. Bennett's obsession that Jane marry as quickly and as rich as possible. Maggie Smith appears as the fictional Lady Gresham, a very slight variation on the snobbish Lady Catherine de Bourgh, whose beloved nephew Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox), recalls several of the prigs and bores that Austen's heroines are always being impelled  to marry.
 
 Wisley and his aunt apparently are entirely fictional, while the dashing Tom Lefroy (played by James McAvoy) was in fact real and acquainted with Jane. A young Irish law student at the time they met, Lefroy may have flirted with Austen and, according to Spence, possibly let her down. But the filmmakers seemed to want to cast a story better suited to the melancholy mood of "Persuasion" in the effervescent tone of "Pride and Prejudice," giving it much the same sassy makeover Fanny Price got in Patricia Rozema's adaptation of "Mansfield Park."
 
 A little of this, a little . . .
The mixing of vague historical anecdote and pure Hollywood fantasy don't quite mix, possibly because the subject of the anecdotes is such an object of fascination. Watching "Becoming Jane" feels like watching the filmmakers try to squeeze one last Austen adaptation out of a maddeningly limited oeuvre. It's true five of the six novels have been adapted and re-adapted to death, but, hey, there's always "Northanger Abbey."
 
 The movie begins at a church service, where Jane listens to her father deliver a sermon explaining why wit is a treacherous talent in women. Undaunted, she continues to mulishly rebuff the stiff and lurking Mr. Wisley and dream of living by her pen. If Jane is predisposed not to want to marry Wisley at the start of the film, all bets are off when the dashing Mr. Lefroy, whom we first spy shirtless and socking a rival in a gloveless boxing match, enters the picture. This being Austen, as well as a costume rom-com of sorts, the pair dislike each  other at first sight. She thinks him an arrogant, dandified libertine; he thinks her a provincial, sophomoric country mouse. Sparks fly, naturally.
 
 McAvoy is charming, if a little over the top, as the irresistible Regency cad. Handsome, witty, charming, feckless and penniless, he is Mssrs. Wickham, Willoughby and Elton rolled into one -- though, in trying to fashion, if not a happy ending, then at least a reasonably satisfying one out of an outcome that would have been unthinkable in one of Austen's novels, "Becoming Jane" ultimately deprives him of his caddishness.
 
 Visually, "Becoming Jane" falls somewhere between "Emma" and "Persuasion" in terms of its faithfulness to Regency-era hygiene and lifestyle, though it edges nearer to "Clueless" when it comes to sex. A scene that takes place in the hedges feels particularly pretty daring for the times and the person in question. But it's nothing compared with the scene in the library. "Is this conduct common in the natural history of Hampshire?" a naughty Mr. Lefroy asks a flustered Jane after reading to her from a naturalist tome she had primly recommended in which the mating rituals of birds are described in Penthouse Forum-ish terms.
 
 There's nothing really wrong with Hathaway's performance, but the movie tries to cast her as one of Austen's own feisty heroines, and she doesn't quite measure up. Keira Knightley, Kate Winslet, Gwyneth Paltrow and Alicia Silverstone have all evinced more spark and wit than the earnest, straightforward Hathaway.
 
 Austen died at 41 without ever having married, so it falls on "Becoming Jane" not only to invent a great passion for her from flimsy whole cloth, but also to explain its demise in a satisfyingly nonhumiliating way as well. While Spence seems to suggest that Austen's brief flirtation ended in quiet disappointment, the movie invents a melodramatic end of the affair more characteristic of Lydia Bennett than of Lizzie.
 

The classy period chick flick isn't a recent invention. Just look at Wuthering Heights  (1939), in which Laurence Olivier's elegant smolder threatened to set his own knitted eyebrows aflame. Yet there's a special significance to the way that these movies came roaring back with A Room With a View  (1986), a movement that crested in the Jane Austen fever of the '90s  the Pride and Prejudice  miniseries that launched a thousand Colin Firth sighs; the film adaptations of Emma  and Sense and Sensibility  and (the best of them) Persuasion ; and Clueless  and the Bridget Jones comedies, with their wised-up neo-Austen japery. In their way, these films, backlashing against the freedom and scruff of the counterculture, evoked our middle-class longing for a new traditionalism  for the lost trappings of chivalry, for virginity and lace, for the days when even rogues acted like gentlemen.
The single most zeitgeisty thing about them, however, may have been their obsession with money . In the art-house film according to Jane, romance, blessed though it is, is never quite enough  it must be accompanied by exquisite solvency. And you wondered why these tales were timely! In the winsome, heartfelt trifle Becoming Jane , the young Jane Austen (Anne Hathaway), a budding artist in a world where art by women isn't taken seriously, finds herself trapped by the very romance that has set her free. She meets Tom LeFroy (James McAvoy), a rascally lawyer, banished to the countryside by his scolding benefactor of an uncle, and after the usual gavottes, impish-insult flirtations, and peering through the leaves at skinny dipping hunks  scene, she falls for him. But Jane's family, headed by her modest pastor father (James Cromwell), needs money  that is, they need her to marry the earnest, doltish nephew of Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith), a local aristocrat. And while Jane is shrewd enough not to go near that proposition, she can't quite shake off the priority of money-as-security, even if it dooms her love. The scary thing is, she's right.
The movie, it should be pointed out, is mostly a fabrication, spun out of an acquaintance the real Jane Austen, who never married, struck up with a young Irishman. Yet Becoming Jane  has a burnished feminine sadness, and the director, Julian Jarrold, gives it a creamy-dark visual flow. Anne Hathaway, who got wrongfully overshadowed (at least by the critics) in The Devil Wears Prada , uses her big, ripe, sensual features  that giant strawberry of a mouth  to convey appetite  tinged with a softly alluring reticence. When she reads Jane's letters or fiction, Hathaway makes you feel her lust for words, for an eloquence that is engineered to bypass prejudice. McAvoy, so reticent himself in The Last King of Scotland , comes into better focus, cutting Tom's nobility with a bit of 18th-century rock-star caddishness. In speculating how Jane Austen became the writer she was, the film views this man through her eyes and offers a not-bad thesis: To understand love is to confront the agony of losing it.

 How do you explain the Jane Austen bandwagon, which rolls on full steam with “Becoming Jane,” an imitation screen adaptation of an Austen-like novel that imagines the author’s romantic life at 20? Austen’s refined language, which Sarah Williams and Kevin Hood’s screenplay does a reasonably good job of capturing, is part of the charm. In the age of “whatever,” who doesn’t relish receiving a scrupulously considered, grammatically correct answer to a question?  Austen’s reassuring brand of sense and sensibility, grounded in wit and sound moral judgment, is another attraction. To literate Anglophiles, Austen and everything she represents looms as a symbolic bulwark against the values of today’s babelicious Babylon. The premarital meat market of her era was reassuringly prim.  “Tainted by suspicion” is the nastiest description applied by one woman to another in this film, which plays as a fanciful, scenic (but not too opulent) prequel to “Pride and Prejudice.” That slur is directed at Jane by the wealthy and snobbish Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith), whose beloved nephew Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox) is dissuaded from marrying Jane after she considers, then reconsiders, eloping with her true love.  Like a modern chick-lit heroine, Jane has no interest in marrying a juiceless man, rich or poor, who has the imagination and charisma of a stick. An aspiring novelist in a rigid social order in which  women of conspicuous intelligence are frowned upon, she is willing to take her chances. At its most hardheaded the film makes clear that when Jane forfeits her best opportunity for a financially advantageous match it is no laughing matter.  These imagined Austens live in genteel poverty. Jane’s father (James Cromwell), is a parish preacher, and the family’s hopes for a comfortable future depend on its daughters landing rich husbands. As Jane’s fussbudget mother (Julie Walters) observes, “Affection is desirable; money is absolutely indispensable.”  Jane, however, is determined to marry for love or not all. When Tom Lefroy (James McAvoy), a rakish young Irish lawyer-in-training, comes along, it is him or nothing. Tom gives her a copy of Henry Fielding’s “History of Tom Jones, a Foundling” to educate her about sex.  Austen, as we know, never married. And the movie implies that Tom was the real Mr. Darcy, minus his fortune; hence, no marriage. “Becoming Jane,” directed by Julian Jarrold, whose previous  movie was the garish comedy “Kinky Boots,” drives home the painfully limited options facing British women of limited means in the late-18th and early-19th centuries.  At country dances and balls grown-ups scrutinize the behavior of blushing young women on the marriage block. Fun may be had, but the festivities are fraught with anxiety and calculation.  “Becoming Jane” is a triumph for Anne Hathaway, who brings to the young Jane the same jittery wide-eyed intensity she displayed in “The Devil Wears Prada” along with a secure British accent. She and Mr. McAvoy inject a keen intelligence into the couple’s verbal jousts, along with romantic chemistry.  While Jane struggles to assert some independence, Tom squirms under the iron thumb of his humorless authoritarian uncle, Judge Langlois (Ian Richardson, in his last film role), who wields the purse strings. Everything about Jane, but especially her irony, offends this grim hanging judge, who hands out death sentences with a thunderous righteousness.  Ms. Hathaway , who is almost too pretty for the role, recalls the young Judy Garland, with her panicky stare and cherry lips. Mr. McAvoy’s sexy, good-bad boy, especially in profile, resembles Bob Dylan in his early troubadour mode. With his taste for booze, bare-knuckle boxing and the occasional prostitute, Tom also suggests a whippet version of the young Albert Finney in “Tom Jones.”  Not much is known about the actual Austen-Lefroy relationship except that they met at a ball in 1795 around the time she had begun an early novel that was later reworked as “Sense and Sensibility” and that she described him in a letter to her sister, Cassandra (Anna Maxwell Martin), as “a very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man.” At a ball they apparently caused tongues to wag by sharing three dances instead of the regulation two.  The real-life Lefroy eventually married a wealthy Irish woman with whom he sired seven children and became a successful lawyer. The fanciful coda to “Becoming Jane” imagines a reunion between the grown-up Jane and Tom, now both slightly graying.  The screenplay’s pseudo-Austen tone is so consistent that its lapses into modern romance-novel fantasy threaten to derail the film. A scene suggesting oral sex between Jane’s parents is one. (Ugh!) And after Jane and Tom’s first kiss, when Jane coyly inquires about her osculatory technique, you may want to howl.  This film is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual innuendo.

An ersatz "Pride and Prejudice" in all but name, "Becoming Jane" is a finely tooled Brit-lit costumer that, like Anne Hathaway's flawless accent as the young Austen, lacks only that final convincing 5%. Taking the few facts known about a "romantic encounter" between the budding young scribe and a dashing Irishman, pic cleverly constructs a scenario that closely parallels the original (and especially the superb 2005 film) while also proposing the inspirational roots for the novel and Austen's subsequent oeuvre. Pic should click with upscale auds -- though, like an impeccable copy, it's no substitute for the real thing.
Film -- which opens wide in the U.K. today and is skedded for an Aug. 3 Stateside release via Miramax -- is likely to skew slightly older than Working Title's "Pride & Prejudice," which played up the youthfulness of the characters in the novel. Though only 23 at the time of filming, Hathaway comes across as a considerably more mature, less emotionally fragile character than the 20-year-old she's playing, and overall the movie, smoothly helmed by ex-TV director Julian Jarrold ("Kinky Boots"), remains within the boundaries of the genre rather than trying to push the envelope.
Both the novel and the 2005 Keira Knightley starrer are strongly evoked in the opening reels, which draw Jane (Hathaway) as the slightly pesky daughter of the Rev. Austen (James Cromwell) and his wife (Julie Walters) in rural Hampshire, southern England. A bundle of barely suppressed creative energy, whether playing piano while her elders are trying to sleep or scribbling heated prose, Jane is clearly not your average country vicar's daughter in socially prescribed, late 18th-century Blighty.
While elder sister Cassandra (Anna Maxwell Martin) is comfortably engaged, Jane resists being paired off with Mr. Wisley (Laurence Fox), the blank-faced nephew of Lady Gresham (Maggie Smith). "His fortune will not buy me," says Jane. In dialogue typical of Sarah Williams and Kevin Hood's script, which smartly evokes the flavor of Austen's prose, mom later reminds her that "affection is desirable; money is absolutely indispensable."
Enter young Irishman Tom Lefroy (Scottish thesp James McAvoy, with a British accent), a trainee lawyer of Jane's age. He's an intelligent but penniless lad from Limerick with big-city airs and dandy duds to go with them; she's clearly attracted to him but defensively tries to shut him out as he mocks her femme pulp-literature aspirations.
Suggesting, suggestively, that Jane needs to "widen" her horizons if she's to succeed as a writer, Tom gives her a copy of "Tom Jones" to read and intros her to his favorite sport, bare-knuckle boxing. Without overplaying the sexual undercurrents, Hathaway and McAvoy show real chemistry together in these sequences. And as in the 2005 movie, two gatherings (a local dance and a splashier ball) provide social arenas for their growing relationship.
That's just the first hour of a slightly overlong yarn that parallels the novel while working as a straightforward (and necessarily doomed) romance within the social constrictions of the period. While always very watchable, it's only during the extended coda, set years later, that the picture really packs an emotional punch, belatedly going its own way rather than trying to cover several bases at the same time.
Credits at all levels are pretty much impeccable. Hathaway again shows talent way beyond her age and "The Princess Diaries," and, like Cromwell, blends well into the seasoned cast of Brit players. Thesps strongly evoke their de facto characters from the novel, especially Smith (in the Lady Catherine role), Walters (Mrs. Bennet) and Leo Bill (as a creepy William Collins type). With no obvious counterpart in the novel, Ian Richardson brings some dramatic heft to Judge Langlois, Tom's stern uncle-cum-employer.
Widescreen lensing by Eigil Bryld of rural Ireland (repping Hampshire) and Dublin (repping London) has a fully saturated look that always engages the eyes; ditto production and costume design, which look right for the period but have less of a realist flavor than the 2005 pic. Adrian Johnston's modal score does the job but is thematically unmemorable.

Next to nothing is known about what actually passed between Jane Austen  and Irish lawyer Tom Lefroy , but that hasn't stopped director Julian Jarrold  (Kinky Boots ) from working up a head of romantic steam about their encounter. If you're an Austen reader, you can have an OK time just playing I Spy Pride and Prejudice , as friends and family in Becoming Jane  morph slyly into the novel's characters. But the job at hand is to give Austen (a pretty good, if giggly, Anne Hathaway ) the lively romantic life (with the excellent James McAvoy ) she probably never hadand why not, since that's what she did herself in her novels? Following a delicious (if improbable) flirtatious exchange in which Lefroy lets Jane  know that all she really needs is nookie, Becoming Jane  turns into a presentable Harlequin romance, with hurdle after hurdle succeeded by an eleventh-hour turnaround. I'm grateful that the real-life Austen was freed to write her own superior romances, but I wept like a baby when love lay bleeding on the ground.
