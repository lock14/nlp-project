Money has little to do with the kind of emotional wealth shared so generously in Been Rich All My Life , Heather Lyn MacDonald's affectionate portrait of the Silver Belles  five uptown knockouts who met as Harlem chorus girls in the 1930s and continue to dance into their 80s and beyond. MacDonald mixes choice footage of the hoofers in their prime with loose on-the-spot scenes of octogenarian dailiness in happy times and sad. Injury, illness, and death make appearances, but these remarkable women never lose their gratitude for where their feet have taken them. Good times and bum times, they've seen it all and they're still here. Lucky us.

 “Been Rich All My Life,” an admiring portrait of the Silver Belles, a troupe of veteran Harlem tap dancers between the ages of 84 and 96, is a valuable historical document and a useful how-to movie about making the most of old age. Bertye  Lou Wood, Cleo Hayes, Marion Coles, Fay Ray and Elaine Ellis, the indefatigably spirited dancers who still perform in matching glitter-encrusted costumes, met in the 1930’s as chorus dancers and reunited in 1985.  The documentary is generously supplied with historical film clips of the women’s glory days, when they danced at the Apollo Theater, the Cotton Club, Small’s Paradise and Connie’s Inn and worked with bandleaders like Cab Calloway, Duke Ellington and Jimmy Lunceford. In one clip Ms. Wood, the group’s feisty senior member, is shown dancing beside Bill Robinson.  She also proudly recalls leading a strike by the Apollo chorus line that established the American Guild of Variety Artists as a performers’ union with clout. Ms. Hayes remembers the racial discrimination that she and Ms. Wood faced while performing in the first black USO unit during World War II. Ms. Ray boasts about her post-chorus-line days working as a welder building naval ships during the war.  In one of several mishaps that befall the group during the making of the documentary, Ms. Hayes falls down a flight of subway stairs, endures months of painful rehabilitation and returns to the stage. Ms. Coles (the widow of the legendary dancer Honi Coles) has to have a pacemaker installed. Ms. Ellis perseveres through radiation therapy for cancer.  Nothing stops them except the inevitable. When Ms. Wood breaks her hip in a fall, it begins a precipitous decline that ends with her death.

Providing an inspiration for active retirement, the ex-Harlem Renaissance chorus girls profiled in docu "Been Rich All My Life" are still shaking booty while most of their contemporaries can only shuffle their walkers. Nostalgic tribute by Heather Lyn MacDonald ("Ballot Measure 9") is natural public TV fare that should have a long shelf-life.
None younger than 84, the Silver Belles have been delighting audiences with their not-so-athletic but still sassy moves since Bertye Lou Wood and younger manager Geri Kennedy first assembled the group of former Harlem show dancers in 1985. Currently a performing quartet (96-year-old Bertye just recently stopped dancing), they constitute a treasure-trove of experience illuminating one of the greatest periods in American culture. Demonstrating spunk and independence as early as 12, they often left rural homes for the glamour of the big city, signing on as chorus girls in a then-thriving environment for black talent. They performed at Manhattan's legendary Cotton Club and Apollo Theater and on a 1938 South American tour, backing acts from tap master Bill Robinson to Cab Calloway and Duke Ellington. Archival photos and footage complement the ingratiating subjects' latter-day reminiscences.

The aesthetics of Heather MacDonald 's documentary are not remarkable, but the dancing octogenarians are. In fact, the Silver Belles, five former Harlem chorus girls who are still bustin' a move despite their advanced ages, are the best kind of company there is. Despite not being able to "remember shit," and despite declining and unpredictable bodies, they make it to performance after performance, donning sequins and spangles, and whooping up a whole lotta somethin' in front of sold-out crowds. Been Rich  gives us a slice of American history, as the Belles discuss their origins and their years as chorus girls. They danced with Bill Robinson  (a/k/a Bojangles); shared the stage with Duke Ellington , Ella Fitzgerald , and Louis Armstrong ; and put on upwards of half a dozen shows a day, seven days a week. The Silver Belles are bold, brash, and gorgeously awake, and their willingness to live large is thrilling.
