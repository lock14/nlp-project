 When the Pixies wrapped their 2004  reunion tour at New York’s Hammerstein Ballroom, they could have ripped through a cover of the T-Mobile jingle and the crowd would still have lost its  mind. A reunited, 50-percent-zombie Beatles might have topped that show for frenzy, but not much else. I know, because I was there. Like hordes of kids who came of age in the 1980’s, I worshiped the Pixies.  Now “loudQUIETloud” offers a backstage pass to that legendary tour, and like most documentaries about bands (a genre only slightly less odd than songs about cinema), its chief appeal is to cultists. The “where are they now?” question is answered: nowhere very interesting. The group’s interpersonal dynamic consists of benevolent alienation interrupted by sheepish bonhomie. There is excitement, and nervousness, and triumph. What else would there be? As for showmanship, now as then, the Pixies more or less stand still, content to blister the room with their mutant mix of pop, punk, garage rock and hardcore je ne sais quoi.  Boring people who made extraordinary music, the Pixies are inexplicable. In attempting to demystify them, the directors Steven Cantor and Matthew Galkin achieve the opposite. What’s going through the mind of the frontman Frank Black (born Charles Thomas), the bassist Kim Deal, the guitarist Joey Santiago and the drummer David Lovering? Who knows, who cares, they’re about to play “Gouge Away.

The influential alt-rock-punk band the Pixies is profiled in intimate, affectionate detail in "loudQUIET loud," a concert-reunion road movie that lacks the necessary backstage melodrama needed for crossover success, but will undoubtedly create nationwide art-house exposure and a small craze in college towns. 
Pic is targeted at the already initiated, but directors Steve Cantor and Matthew Galkin deftly resolve one often glaring problem with tribute documentaries -- making those who might not care do so.
With one opening title, "loudQUIETloud" establishes why the viewer should give a rap about a group first formed in 1986, and which broke up in 1993. "I was just trying to rip off the Pixies," Kurt Cobain is quoted as saying, about Nirvana's "Smells Like Teen Spirit." For any audience remotely interested in pop culture, "a film about the Pixies" thereafter becomes required viewing.
The Pixies' members -- lead singer-songwriter Charles "Black Francis" Thompson; lead guitarist Joey Santiago; bassist-vocalist Kim Deal, and drummer David Lovering -- have all pursued other avenues in the years preceding their 2004 reunion tour: For Black Francis, it's been the band Frank Black and the Catholics; for Deal, the Breeders; for Santiago, scoring films; for Lovering, a magic act.
One of the film's more poignant sequences and a terrific example of Cantor and Galkin's economic and evocative filmmaking, is the crosscutting between male band members as they all shave their once hairy heads down to a fashionable, baldness-disguising burr. It also reinforces the sense that the Pixies is a big, pop Barcalounger, a place to relax in approaching middle-age, as the members express little love for an act that dissolved in acrimony 11 years before.
Other than a drug-addled drum solo from Lovering that prompts a confrontation with his bandmates, the film has very little high drama. Still, the pic includes a great deal of inspired music and a solid perspective on art and tension.
Pic looks splendid, the sound is first-rate and numerous cameras provide a prowling appraisal of the band.

Directors Steven Cantor  and Matthew Galkin  titled their documentary about the Pixies ' 2004 reunion tour loudQUIETloud  because the band's well-rehearsed performances are indeed loudage hasn't stolen a single decibel from the group's genre-defining fusion of angular post-punk and catchy powerpop. But behind the scenes, all is quiet: Charles Thompson  (a/k/a Black Francis ), Kim Deal , Joey Santiago , and David Lovering  have little to talk about. They've grown into very different individuals who have just one thing in common: cashing in on a sound that has spawned a worldwide cult of rabid fans, even more so since the Boston quartet broke up in 1992. It's the personal lives behind the myth that Cantor and Galkin examine, though there's not much to work with. All four are fairly average and pretty likable, dealing with problems we all deal with: substance abuse, divorce, death, parenthood, etc. Beyond Lovering popping Valium  and bumming out his bandmates, the entire affair looks and feels like a reality television show minus the cheap drama.
