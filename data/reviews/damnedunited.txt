Leeds United. Derby County. The FA Cup. Those who speak the language of English football are ahead of the game when it comes to enjoying The Damned United , about a brief, blighted chapter in the professional life of legendary football manager Brian Clough. Fans already know that Clough, who died in 2004, lasted exactly 44 days as manager of reigning football champs Leeds United in 1974  a period this rousing British sports pic dramatizes with fierce verve. For the rest  just guessing, the majority of Americans?  what's lost in translation is recovered easily enough in Michael Sheen's astonishing performance as Clough.
It's no accident that Sheen displays some of the same incisive understanding of human   inconsistency and political strategy that he demonstrated in The Queen  and Frost/Nixon : Peter Morgan wrote all three screenplays, adapting this script from David Peace's acclaimed   novel The Damned Utd . Meanwhile, director Tom Hooper, who won heaps of awards for HBO's John Adams , turns the talk of men into action scenes. The great cast includes Timothy Spall as the assistant manager, Colm Meaney as Clough's nemesis, and Jim Broadbent as a sports exec who'd make George Steinbrenner nervous.


 Correction Appended  Back in the old, pre-cable days, “Wide World of Sports” on ABC used to promise “the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.” That famous catchphrase contained an implicit recognition of a fact seldom acknowledged in America’s triumphalist sports culture, namely that failure can be as compelling as success, sometimes even more so.  Maybe England is different. In any case, “The Damned United” is the rare sports movie that deals with — indeed positively relishes — humiliation and disappointment. Its real-life protagonist, the soccer coach Brian Clough (who died in 2004), was, over his long career, a winner with an extraordinary record of accomplishment. But the film, directed by Tom Hooper from Peter Morgan’s script (based on a novel by David Peace), is much more interested in the dramatic flameout that disrupted and almost ended his rise to football glory.  You’ve probably seen a dozen movies — “Hoosiers,” “Glory Road,” even “Slap Shot” — in which a tough coach takes a squad of misfits and underachievers and turns them into champions. Clough (Michael Sheen), perhaps uniquely in the annals of sporting cinema, reverses the process. Hired with great fanfare in 1974 to manage the mighty Leeds United club, he alienates players, fans and management and sends the team into a tailspin. At his very first practice he tells the Leeds stars, who play a rough, mean brand of football, that they are not champions but thugs and cheaters. Oddly, they resist his invitation to reform their ways.  One theme “The Damned United” explores is the difficulty of filling the shoes of a beloved, charismatic leader. Clough takes over Leeds after its longtime manager, Don Revie (Colm Meaney), assumes the leadership of the English national team. Over the years, Revie has become the personification of his team and a hero of West Yorkshire. A hard act for anyone to follow, but especially vexing for Clough, whose obsession with Revie — a combination of rivalry and idolatry, visceral loathing and disappointed love — turns out to be as much a driving force in his career as his own ambition.  The two men are a study in temperamental and generational contrasts. Revie, solid and phlegmatic, is an English bulldog of the old school, while Clough is more like a rooster, crowing and strutting in pursuit of his own celebrity. He is a complicated fellow, and while the filmmakers are fascinated by his self-aggrandizing motives and his self-defeating behavior, they are not entirely sympathetic.  Mr. Hooper switches back and forth between Clough’s doomed tenure at Leeds and his earlier experience transforming a hapless provincial club called Derby County into a respectable upper-division contender. He was helped by Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), his loyal right-hand man, and frequently stymied by the team’s chairman, a cigar-chewing, Monopoly-board plutocrat played by Jim Broadbent. Needless to say, Mr. Spall and Mr. Broadbent do a great deal to enliven “The Damned United,” in the way that only great British character actors can.  And Mr. Sheen, for his part, expands his remarkable anthology of famous modern Britons, turning the actor’s art into a form of Plutarchan character study. I can’t assess the accuracy of the portrait — provincial American part-time soccer dad that I am, I had never heard of Brian Clough before — and it obviously is not complete. But Mr. Sheen’s performance is persuasive and illuminating not only of the man’s doubts and aspirations but also, as if from within, of his world.  Clough’s vanity and his inability to control his speech or foresee its effects land him in trouble, and the film is wise not to blow these up into tragic flaws. He is not Prince Hal or Coriolanus, but rather a creature of the modern, media-saturated world. “The Damned United” shares with “The Queen” and “Frost/Nixon” not only a writer and a star, but also a precise and satisfying sense of proportion.  In all three films, Mr. Sheen plays a fast-moving, clever, insecure man whose momentum is stalled by a stubborn, somewhat enigmatic older figure. Don Revie is for Brian Clough what Richard Nixon is to David Frost and Queen Elizabeth is to Tony Blair: a nemesis, a symbol, the possessor of an elusive and archaic, almost magical kind of power. As the confrontation between these magi and their would-be acolytes (or usurpers) unfolds, an entire social order snaps into focus.  And so in “The Damned United” we perceive an angry, tired and polarized Britain, split between old ways and new, between North and South, between Labor and Tory. Football is the mirror and outlet for these resentments, but the movie to its credit (if also to the potential dismay of some fans) does not really bother with what happens on the field. That’s a mere diversion from the real drama, which involves power, money and men in suits.  “The Damned United” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). British football fans, players and coaches swear a lot when they’re upset. Also when they’re happy. Pretty much when they’re awake.

Telling with a light, surefooted touch a legendary tale from British soccer history, "The Damned United" reps the latest collaboration in factual fiction between chameleon thesp Michael Sheen, screenwriter Peter Morgan and producer Andy Harries ("Frost/Nixon," "The Queen"). This time, the subject isn't politics but "the beautiful game," with a bromance twist as the pic recounts the career highlights of '70s-era team manager Brian Clough. Stylish feature debut by Tom Hooper should do well in Blighty, especially among males and upscale auds, but faces a harder B.O. fight in territories where Clough's not known and Sheen's not a draw.
Based on a somewhat bleaker novel by David Peace, the pic deploys complex but never confusing flashbacks to unfold a story that essentially spans eight years, from 1968-74. During this time, working-class-boy-made-good Clough (Sheen) goes from overseeing a miraculous rise up the league table for English soccer team Derby County to managing Derby's archrival, Leeds United. At the time Clough takes over, Leeds is at the top of the tables, due to the stewardship of patriarchal manager Don Revie (Colm Meaney), who has left to take over England's World Cup squad.
However, Clough has long harbored resentment toward Revie, and he alienates the Leeds players before he even starts, publically dissing his predecessor and criticizing them personally for their dirty tactics on the pitch. What's more, Clough's longtime collaborator, assistant manager Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), doesn't come with him to Leeds.
Without Taylor's wisdom and football savvy, Leeds quickly begins losing games. After just 44 days on the job, Clough is sacked.
Despite the ignominy, Clough's memory (he died in 2004) is still cherished by sport fans for his flamboyance, honesty and flair, both as a talkshow personality and as a manager. In the U.K., even those barely interested in the game know he's reckoned to be, as the pic's closing subtitles proclaim, "the greatest manager England (the World Cup team) never had."
There's hardly more than five minutes of actual ball-kicking onscreen, and what's there is mostly seamlessly stitched-in archival footage. Diehard fans may actually feel shortchanged by the strategy. But it makes for more accessible drama that emphasizes themes of friendship, rivalry, honor and loyalty by focusing on Clough's relationship with Taylor and, to a lesser extent, Revie.
Like all Morgan's work, the effect is slightly too didactic and redolent of legit-land's theater of ethics, but done with brio.
Sheen's typically scrupulous channeling of Clough gets the tics and mannerisms right, but also carves a moving portrait of a braggart suddenly out of his depth -- not unlike his David Frost in "Frost/Nixon" and Tony Blair in "The Queen," but on a more tragic trajectory. As Taylor, Spall matches him in skill, playing a quiet, principled man content to stand in Clough's shadow until a cross word too far tears them apart.
At base, the pic is a chaste love story between these two men, who are often seen hugging, kissing and even, at one point, dancing with each other to the strains of "Love and Marriage." Their relationship is sufficiently compelling that distaff auds shouldn't feel bored by all the sports talk. (There's not a single female character here who has more than 10 lines of dialogue.) Meaney, as Revie, and Jim Broadbent, as Derby County's gruff chairman Sam Longson, lend fine support.
Pic was originally developed as a Stephen Frears-helmed project in the wake of "The Queen," but helmer Hooper (who previously collaborated with producer Harries on the acclaimed TV drama "Longford") brings a distinctive style of his own. It's not just the flair he already displayed with docudrama in the magnificent HBO series "John Adams," but also his striking penchant for off-kilter camera setups, which place characters, especially in moments of anxiety, in odd corners of the frame or hunkered down on the edge. Kudos are also due lenser Ben Smithard, whose visuals replicate the grainy, sun-deprived look of British film of the era.
Period styling throughout is on the money, from Eve Stewart's understated but uncannily accurate production design to Mike O'Neill's costumes. Only the somewhat unconvincing wigs hit a jarring note.

We call it soccer, but for the Brits, it's football, and it's damn serious business. From 1968 to 1974, Brian Clough  (Michael Sheen ), a manager/coach from the tiny town of Derby, and his assistant manager, Peter Taylor  (Timothy Spall ), turned a third-rate club into division champs. That success wasn't nearly as sweet as getting to take over Leeds United , a top-tier team previously managed by Clough's arch enemy, Don Revie  (Colm Meaney ). In this terrific film, screenwriter Peter Morgan  (The Queen , Frost/Nixon ) and television director Tom Hooper  (John Adams  ), making his feature debut, use a series of elegantly staged flashbacks to trace Clough and Taylor's rapid rise to fame, and the hubris that led the former to stumble badly when he got to Leeds , while also wounding his lifelong friendship with Taylor. A movie about soccer that doesn't spend a lot of time on the field, The Damned United , like everything Morgan writes, is an intimate character study, one that is enriched by a stellar ensemble of British pros, including Jim Broadbent  as Derby's team owner. These actors are good at what they do—like those soccer players that dodge and weave with effortless grace.
