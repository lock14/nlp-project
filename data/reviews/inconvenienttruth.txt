         Critics have labeled Al Gore and his decades-long crusade to curb global warming as "alarmist." But if you've been warning people that the sky is falling for more than 20 years and it really is 
falling (or at least heating up), don't you have an obligation to sound an alarm?
 
 The highly persuasive documentary "An Inconvenient Truth" captures Gore delivering a multimedia presentation he has given an estimated 1,000 times since 1989. The talk is augmented with an impressive array of graphs, animation, anecdotes and statistics that convey a flurry of facts, projections and conjecture, all pointing to the ill effects the present rate of emissions has on the environment. A film with a clear point of view (and little room for others), it is the inspiration of producers Laurie David and Lawrence Bender, who attended Gore's lecture, decided it had to be made into a film to broaden the reach of its message and recruited director Davis Guggenheim to shoot it.
 


         






   Guggenheim intercuts the lecture with footage of Gore on the road, studiously working out his presentation on his ubiquitous laptop, and segments that effectively show the crucible moments in his life that led him to continually rededicate himself to this topic. There's the college professor who first taught him about climate change in the late 1960s, the death of Gore's sister Nancy from cancer and the 1989 accident that nearly claimed the life of his son. While the vignettes establish Gore's long-term commitment, unfortunately there's a slickness to them that plays like a campaign film that might be shown at a political convention.
 
 Gore might not be anybody's idea of a pitchman, but here he's matched with the right topic, one for which he demonstrates real passion. He's charming, intelligent, professorial and one might even say  presidential. In fact, more than one observer has commented that if this Al Gore had been more visible during the 2000 election there may have been a different outcome.
 
 Rather than alarmed, Gore comes off as poised, relaxed and confident. Guggenheim sets up Citizen Al as part rock star, part eco-Buddha. He introduces himself to a small audience saying, "I'm Al Gore, and I used to be the next president of the United States." The line gets a laugh and quickly addresses the considerable baggage that comes with being on the losing end of one of the most divisive political outcomes in U.S. history.
 
 This position has its pros and cons for the film. On the plus side, Gore stands tall as an insider pushed to the fringe, a man on a mission with nothing to lose. He's able to attack the issue without equivocation. On the minus side, it's easy for naysayers to claim that the digs he makes at conservatives are sour grapes and he's merely positioning himself to run again in 2008 — though this would appear to be a longshot issue on which to do so.
 
 The environment has not resonated much with voters or politicians in the past, though the increasing popularity of hybrid cars and eco-friendly products and services might indicate a shift in attitudes. That something so important could be largely ignored for so long is almost inconceivable, and among the things the film does well is an analysis as to why that is. A 2004 Science magazine survey of more than 900 peer-reviewed academic papers on the subject of global warming found that all supported the reality while none contested it. However, a like sampling of mainstream media found that 53% of the stories portrayed global warming as something that was in doubt in the scientific community. The mixed message has kept the automobile and oil industries in the driver's seat and the issue out of political debates.
 
 Gore also does an excellent job of explaining the basic science behind climate change and the accelerated rise in temperatures since the 1970s. What could be very dry material is enlivened by Gore's geniality and desire to share the information. The potential for dreaded heaviosity is leavened at times by his dry wit and humorous moments, such as a clip from Matt Groening's animated series "Futurama."
 
 Real and projected catastrophes reveal what is at stake. Glacier erosion, the threat to wildlife and the spread of deadly viruses make for some terrifying scenarios. Hurricane Katrina and other weather-related disasters that occurred in late 2005 are included, giving the film a sense of timeliness and a powerful visual element, which Gore compares to "a nature hike through the Book of Revelations."
 
 The other strong point that Gore makes is to dispute the "either/or" argument presented by big business when it comes to making the necessary changes. He uses Upton Sinclair's quote, "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it," to not-so-subtly stress the motivation behind this line of thinking.
 
 The film's title refers to politicians' apprehensiveness in addressing the problem. Attempts at strict environmental reform have long been met with gloomy projections from the right of economic disaster in the form of lost jobs and factory closures, and Gore rebuts this by suggesting that green business can be good business.
 
 Although the message of the film sounds bleak, it is actually quite rousing. Gore offers measures that can be taken on personal and community levels but also stresses that major changes require a larger response. The film's ultimate significance is that this requires political will — which Gore labels a "renewable resource" — and that if our present representatives are not up to the challenge, we elect men and women who are.

Conservatives love to bash the 1960s, but when you think about it, the ones who should really be distancing themselves from that activist decade are those who seek to warn us about the perils of global warming. Every day, they must wonder why more of America isn't with them. Is it laziness? Denial? The pernicious influence of corporate propaganda? All of the above, perhaps, but there's a deeper cultural reason. Global warming has its roots in '60s environmentalism  or, as it was known then, ecology. For a lot of people, the topic still carries a liberal-left tree-hugger vibe, and a taint of conspiracy. The right-wing strategy, which has been to paint global warming as a lofty hypothetical  an alarmist scenario pushed by pesky Chicken Littles  is a way of relegating it back to the era of '60s paranoia. The challenge is how to clear those counterculture mists and claim the issue, forever, as a mainstream crisis.
That's what An Inconvenient Truth  brings off. Be warned, for I am about to write seven of the scariest words ever to confront moviegoers: This is a documentary starring Al Gore. Is your heart still functioning? In An Inconvenient Truth , the man who now introduces himself by saying ''I used to be the next President of the United States'' is seen giving a lecture in which he outlines, with furrowed brow but a reassuringly jovial authority, the facts of global warming: how it works, why it's really occurring, and what will happen  not could, but will  if we fail to stop it.
I only do wish that the Al Gore who ran for president in 2000 could have had a peek at the Al Gore who presides over An Inconvenient Truth . The hectoring scold, with his sighs and grimaces, his manservant stiffness, has been replaced by a funny and eloquent yarn spinner who might be ushering us into his comfy study. Backed by a beautiful collage of a slide show, Gore engages us in the mysteries of the earth  how the planet looks from space, the craggy prehistorical grandeur of glaciers (and the visible horror of their melting away), what global warming means for weather patterns, trees, oceans, populations.
The beauty part is, Gore isn't preaching to the converted. He's reaching out to the skeptics, pitching his lecture to those who believe that there might, sort of, kind of, be something to all this but are wired, in their guts, to suspect otherwise. Early on, Gore debunks the conservative myth that global warming may be happening (slightly), but that it's merely cyclical, by making himself into a sight gag, with an elevated ladder that hoists him up a geological graph, showing, as a visual-numerical fact, the unprecedented levels temperatures are now at. That's just one of his many professorial/showman tricks: before-and-after slides of Mount Kilimanjaro and other hot spots, computer simulations of the effects of the potential catastrophe of the polar ice caps melting  which, make no mistake, they are. An Inconvenient Truth  can't, of course, reveal a future that is still up to us, but by the time you're done watching, the real question is, Which way on God's green earth would you want to err?

Former VP and Presidential candidate Al Gore's crusade to raise awareness of global warming gets a useful new platform in "An Inconvenient Truth." Davis Guggenheim's docu is a straightforward record of the lecture Gore has toured for years, juiced by elaborate graphics. An excellent educational tool, pic may prove an awkward fit for theatrical distribution. Exposure through academic/activist channels and perhaps self-distributed, one-night-stand bookings (a la Warren Miller's sports films) could work best.
Defining how global warming works on the atmosphere and dramatically illustrating its effects with before-and-after photos of drastically shrunken glaciers, et al., Gore's data is concise and accessible, greatly aided by a state-of-the-art slide show involving computerized charts, photos, archival footage, even cartoons. Point is that pollution has wrought more drastic changes in a few decades than Earth has seen since the last Ice Age, with truly dire consequences just years ahead. Not a naturally ingratiating speaker, and one whose frequent stabs at humor here fall flat, Gore nonetheless builds a persuasive case for immediate action. Brief sequences of him as a lonely eco-warrior out on the road strike a contrived note, however. Tech aspects are first-rate.

With ice caps melting, sea levels rising, and Poseidon  sinking fast, this is no environment for any disaster movie, particularly a real one, to take our interest for granted. Thus An Inconvenient Truth , named for the super-bad news of global climate change, isn't just another lefty doc for the art house set, but "by far the most terrifying film you will ever see," according to the ads, which feature a trio of smokestacks spewing what looks like the perfect storm. Fear sells . . . usually. But how scary is it that this sugarcoated pill would be administered by Al Gore , an activist whose seemingly pharmaceutical calm is almost as alarming as his message? Credit the "former next president" and his director, Davis Guggenheim , with recognizing that their film of Gore's self-described "slide show" might come across as a bit more human with the help of a supporting playernamely a Pixarish polar bear whose would-be ice rafts crack under claw.
Seriously: That sad CG creature, left to drown in warm arctic water, emotes more poignantly than Gore or even the prehistoric casualties of Ice Age: The Meltdown a crucial achievement for a summer movie whose truth runs the risk of remaining merely inconvenient if it can't compete with fiction. Suffice it to say that the Al Gore concert film ain't exactly Dave Chappelle 's Block Party . Onstage, pointer in hand, the pedant Gore mounts a hydraulic lift to follow the climb of carbon dioxide literally off the chartsa dramatic high point of his presentation. More effective in attention-getting terms are the Cameronian computer images of the ocean engulfing Lower Manhattan  (the projected result of the Greenland ice sheet 's shrink by 2050) and Gore's commentary: "Is it possible that we should guard against other threats besides terrorists?"
An Inconvenient Truth , produced last year but released, conveniently, during a new low for both presidential approval ratings and SUV resale values, isn't afraid to Bush-bash even at the risk of appearing partisan (or petulant) on the part of its leading man. Gore asserts in the film that the issues facing the planet are, above all, moral an argument that would seem hard or impossible for anyone outside of the current administration to refute. Yet the personal is political, as the saying goes, and whenever Guggenheim departs from the show-and-tell to sketch the speaker's motives, the film makes for compelling psychobiography despite the fact that Gore, stiff as an air-conditioned breeze at the Four Seasons, isn't the least bit compelling himself.
"Well, that was a hard blow," the un(s)elected candidate declares with body-snatched understatement over the usual TV news montage of Florida 's sudden climate change from blue to red. "What do you do? You make the best of it." Gore's election "loss," added to the lingering effects of family tragedy (his sister's death from lung cancer, his six-year-old's near-fatal accident) and his college science prof's persuasive weather predictions, is used to explain the pol's resolve to take his global warning on a world tour. Guggenheim's backstage repertoire consists mainly of Gore looking pensively out the windows of airplanes and town cars, the activist jet-setter's fuel-burning justified unconditionally by his urgent need to get out the message (if not the vote).
That message, as delivered by the film in abbreviated form, culminates in an end-credit list of questions (e.g., "Are you ready to change the way you live?") and constructive advice, including, "Encourage everyone you know to see this movie." I guess I can do that. An Inconvenient Truth  does restore one's faith in the value of documentary-as-lecture, not least by extolling the virtues (rare as clean water these days) of politician-as-teacher. The lengthy handheld shot that follows the star from greenroom to stage as applause builds steadily in volume won't turn Gore into Bono, but the man who would've been president speaks in complete sen- tences about scientific fact, particularly as it relates to looming global catastro- phe. And by current standards, that's a helluva lot.
How much can Truth  do to lower the temperature? More than Fahrenheit 9/11 ? The film charts the consequences of Gore's life circumstances on his work and, more literally, those of our civilization on the planet, drawing irrefutable connections between CO2 levels and global warming, ocean temperatures and storm strengths, thawing permafrost and "drunken trees," and the combined effect of all this on the depletion of soil and water and the spread of disease. Call Moviefone today? That CG polar bear would seem essential and, in the absence of Superman, maybe not enough. One shudders to think that our blockbusting fantasies of disaster might've dulled our sense of the real thing, but such fear certainly explains the uncanny resemblance of Truth 's advertising to The Day After Tomorrow 's. It's a tough climate in more ways than one.
On the bright side, reality still has an impactperhaps even what you'd call deep impact . During the last screening at Sundance , where An Inconvenient Truth premiered, the footage that drew the most audible response was archivalthat of an Antarctic ice shelf's tragic fall to the sea. Louder than the massive crash of ice on water was the audience's collective gasp.
