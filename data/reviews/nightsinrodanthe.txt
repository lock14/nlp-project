When it comes to movies about tragic love affairs, it�s all about the waterworks � they don�t call them weepies for nothing. The sadder the story, the higher the hanky count. Although contemporary audiences still like a good cry, the romantic ideal of doomed romance has changed over the years. Grand gestures such as throwing oneself in front of a train have given way to more accessible notions of star-crossed love such as Nights in Rodanthe
, a flawed but occasionally affecting film about second chances and third acts. Based on the Nicholas Spark novel about the brief encounter between a troubled surgeon (Gere) and a lonely woman (Lane) at a secluded inn on Hatteras Island, the film does justice to the belief that love comes at you when you least expect it. The frustrating thing about Nights in Rodanthe
, however, is how it seemingly undermines itself at every turn. For every one step forward it takes in scenes that tellingly depict the way people navigate the thrill of mutual attraction, it takes two steps backward in others in which dramatic moments are fabricated simply for the sake of a little noise apart from the sound of people talking to one another. A shouting match during the onset of a hurricane hasn�t an inkling of real emotion despite all its bluster; it�s as if the film distrusts its ability to draw us into the developing relationship between its principal characters on the merits of love alone. Of course, once the two lovers converge and the obligatory sex scene is performed (watching close-ups of actors undulating on top of each other has become a true movie clich�), Nights in Rodanthe
 enters familiar three-hanky territory that is nearly redeemed by the compelling presence of Lane as a woman reborn. (Gere usually disappears when they�re on the screen together.) Her remarkable performance � particularly the way she comes to life and transforms into a confident, sexualized human being � is what makes this movie watchable. Lane might strike some as a bit actressy, but she knows how to pull it off in an almost self-effacing way. Though the film doesn�t do her justice in the final reels as it struggles to give us something to cry about, Lane gives you something real and heartfelt. Nights in Rodanthe
 may not be the best chick flick around, but it�s the flick with the best chick by far.


About those "Nights in Rodanthe": They're about as steamy as a cup of tea. But it's not for a lack for trying. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere) meets Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane), the temporary proprietress at his bed and breakfast, gives her his heart, and love letters ensue. Sample: "Was it the storm, the wine, or the way you looked at me?" Another: "Nothing compares to the peaks and valleys I traced along your body." One more: "When I write to you, I feel your breath."
That's funny. When you two write to each other, I smell chai.
This movie is the magical mug two strangers share when they have a big old North Carolina beachfront 
B&B to themselves. On one side of the table is Gere, ready to lower his guard for love. Again.
One the other side of the table is Diane Lane, America's favorite unhappily divorced/unhappily married/unhappily single woman ready to have a man turn her iron will to goo. "Rodanthe" gives Lane an opportunity to go gooey with the man - Gere - she cheated on in their last movie together, Adrian Lyne's "Unfaithful." That movie was simple (sex with a French stranger is great!); this new one is simpler (we need a hit!).
That's not to say there's nothing to like here. Mae Whitman, as Lane's testy daughter, and James Franco, here briefly as Gere's son, are among the actors who seem to be having a good time. Poor Scott Glenn, as a man in mourning, and Pablo Schreiber, as his badly accented son, don't. Even so, they're good, too. But Viola Davis, as Lane's best friend and the actual owner of the inn Adrienne is babysitting, appears to be calling in from some orgasm-inducing spa. She greets every detail about Paul as though it might have some aphrodisiac quality. This year's "I'll Have What She's Having Award" goes to her.
George C. Wolfe, the highly esteemed New York stage director, brings a lot of bristling energy to this adaptation of one of Nicholas Sparks's best-selling bubble baths. I'm tempted to say all the crane shots, pirouetting camera work, and jumpy editing are in vain, but the truth is they kept me awake.
Wolfe even makes evocative use of Dinah Washington and some African-American folk paintings that Davis's character creates and collects. And he lets all the truth in Adrienne's advice to her daughter about holding out for real love sink in. But once a hurricane blows Gere and Lane into each other's arms, all the director's tasteful style and good sense turn into mush. Given the material, I suppose it has to.
There's not much else to say about a movie in which the stars drunkenly heave tins of Spam and lard into the trash - only that it's more succinct film criticism than anything you just read.


Fans of the sweetheart novels of Nicholas Sparks know what they like: the big emotions, the dramatic heartbreaks, the author's earnest belief in the sanctity of family, letter-writing, North Carolina, and narrative flashback. But even keepers of the Sparks flame are likely to have their spirits dampened by the wind-rattled, Diane Lane and Richard Gere encrusted adaptation of Nights in Rodanthe . Here, a storm surge of love overtakes Lane and Gere as two middle-aged gorgeous people  wounded veterans of marriage  who are the only occupants of a house-goods-to-die-for seaside inn on North Carolina's Outer Banks. On a fateful weekend. In hurricane season.
Although Ann Peacock and John Romano's script does away with the author's wave-crashing, forward-and-backward storytelling structure and many secondary details, the basics are all from the book. (In other words, like it or get your crab lumps elsewhere.) What's unique to the movie, though, and what tires out even a receptive student of the Bridges of Madison County  school of weepies, is a desperate colorfulness overlaid by director George C. Wolfe a busyness in everything from set decor to acting style to the way the romance-ified shots are strung together. Reunited after Unfaithful  (and, before that, The Cotton Club ), Lane and Gere mime adult courtship with the efficiency of synchronized swimmers. Yet in this ocean of emotion, they look like they're drowning. C–

 Hollywood used to know how to make a lady suffer. It might have thrown her around a little and smudged her mascara, but it also gave as much as it took, delivering the pleasurable goods along with the pain. The emotions were as phony as the tears, yet with the right director, star or script, all that weeping could send an arrow straight through your heart. The audience worshiped Our Lady of Masochism for her misery but also for her triumph, for the mink swaddling her shoulder pads, for the 100 sobbing violins, for the celestial halo circling her head. She was a glamorous sacrament, a delectable offering for the big-screen faithful.  It’s no wonder the faithful continue to forsake the movies, given junky embarrassments like “Nights in Rodanthe.” There’s no joy and not even much cruel laughter to be had from the spectacle of sympathetic actors — Richard Gere, Diane Lane,  Viola Davis, James Franco  — mouthing some of the most pitiful, platitudinous, risible dialogue in recent memory, particularly if you were suckered into  watching this movie specifically because of its performers. Even those with a high tolerance for melodramatic drivel, who have stuck by Sandra Bullock through thick, thin and her changing smile, or found themselves sniffling at “The Notebook” yet again because, well, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams should be together, will find “Rodanthe” insulting, an assault on their already perilously weakened romantic hearts.  Adapted by Ann Peacock and John Romano  from the Nicholas Sparks novel and directed by George C. Wolfe (the former producer of the Public Theater, who fared better with his HBO movie “Lackawanna Blues”), “Nights in Rodanthe” revolves around the unhappily married Adrienne (Ms. Lane), who leaves her two nauseating children with her husband to baby-sit a North Carolina coastal inn owned by a friend (Ms. Davis), who has gone off for weekend sex with a muscled bit player. A hurricane is a-coming and so is Paul (Mr. Gere), one of those lonely Jaguar-driving geniuses of the operating room. The hurricane hits, and the shutters bang open and shut, which would be funnier if this film didn’t insist that the only road to a woman’s happiness runs up her legs.  You know the rest: trembling lips, delicate lovemaking, pop-song montage. Ms. Lane and Mr. Gere smile bravely and fumble like teenagers but are defeated by the scripted clichés and lack of focused direction. Mr. Wolfe seems as uncomfortable with the material as his leads are, though it’s impossible to know if he’s uninterested in this romance or whether his disjointed storytelling is a result of post-production triage.  Whatever the case, it’s a shame that beautiful movie suffering has gone the way of the durable hack, the kind of studio lifer who knew that action meant, you know, action, and came equipped with a cinematographer who could turn light and shadow and all those glistening tears into a night to remember.  “Nights in Rodanthe” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

After memorably teaming in "Unfaithful" (and years before that in "The Cotton Club"), Diane Lane and Richard Gere are less memorably reunited in this spare but effective telling of a novel by Nicholas Sparks, he of "The Notebook" renown. It's the sort of film, frankly, one either utterly succumbs to or stubbornly resists, and those opting for the former course shouldn't be disappointed. Lane has practically cornered the market on romantic chick flicks for a slightly older audience, and this one should find a modest sweet spot in theatrical release before inevitable immortality in endless airings on Lifetime.
As directed by George C. Wolfe (HBO's "Lackawanna Blues") and adapted by Ann Peacock and John Romano, "Nights in Rodanthe" plays like a two-character piece, with a handful of decent cameos (including an uncredited one by James Franco) for the supporting cast.
Adrienne (Lane) is still wounded by the infidelity and departure of her husband, Jack (Christopher Meloni), who puts in a plea for forgiveness and reconciliation before taking the kids on a vacation to Orlando. She decides to think it over while spending a few days overseeing the North Carolina beachfront inn inherited by her friend Jean (Viola Davis).
Enter Paul (Gere), a doctor -- and the inn's lone guest -- on twin missions of personal redemption, the first involving a case that went bad, and the second, his estranged son (Franco). Paul and Adrienne initially share some awkward moments getting acquainted before a hurricane buffets the beach, almost literally throwing them into each other's arms. Another sort of whirlwind -- this one of the romantic variety -- ensues, complicated by the fact that both have lives and commitments elsewhere.
Credit the natural rapport between Gere and Lane -- who somehow seems to look more luminous the less you doll her up -- for filling in what's really a pretty thin gruel, elevating material that, with lesser stars, could easily have been transformed into a Hallmark Channel movie. Both convey not only pain but also a sense of surprised giddiness at the prospect of this new relationship, which surely has a reassuring quality to those on the down side of 40.
While "The Notebook" tugged at powerful emotional chords, producer Denise Di Novi also brought Sparks' "Message in a Bottle" and "A Walk to Remember" to the screen; "Nights in Rodanthe" falls somewhere in between. There's a decidedly old-fashioned streak to the story that actually works to its advantage puttying over the gaps, including the demure love scenes, sweeping ocean vistas and questions of whether Adrienne can recover the ambitions she sidelined for her cheatin' man.
At times more restraint would have been welcome -- Jeanine Tesori's too-urgent score comes to mind -- but that's not really the Sparks formula, which unabashedly deals in love, loss and the possibility of second chances. "Nights in Rodanthe" is hardly groundbreaking, but for those with an appetite for an increasingly rare gust of unapologetic romance, well, as they say, any port in a storm.


Nights in Rodanthe  works so strenuously to satisfy its target audience's every desire that it's a minor surprise that the filmmakers didn't provide cashmere blankets, a snuggly pair of slippers, and a warm cup of cocoa for everyone entering the theater. Based on sap master Nicholas Sparks 's novel, Nights  introduces us to Adrienne (Diane Lane ), an overworked mother separated from her no-good husband who decides to take a mini-vacation by running her friend's North Carolina beachfront inn for a few days. Her only guest is Paul (Richard Gere ), a divorced plastic surgeon who also needs a break from his life. What follows is absolutely exactly what you think is going to happen every step of the way, with Lane doing her standard feisty-mature-hottie routine and Gere in sensitive-heartthrob mode. The feature directorial debut of theater veteran George C. Wolfe  (Angels in America ), Nights in Rodanthe  exhibits a certain amount of integrity in its dedication to being uncomplicated, unashamed romantic goo, but after a while, its self-serious celebration of middle-aged ennui redeemed by screwing a handsome stranger with a full head of hair can't help but inspire a couple cynical chuckles. Still, don't be surprised if your mom loves it.
