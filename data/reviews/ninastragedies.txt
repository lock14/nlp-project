he events in "Nina's Tragedies," a flighty Israeli film that takes whimsical tangents into the absurd, spring from entries in a secret journal kept by Nadav (Aviv Elkabets), a glum, bespectacled 14-year-old boy with a dirty mind. As the movie gyrates between comedy and pathos, it toys with magic realism that never bursts into full-flowered surrealist fantasy. "Nina's Tragedies" wobbles along unsteadily, like the gurney with a squeaky wheel that carries a body to its burial in the film's rain-drenched opening scene. Nadav is besotted with his mother's beautiful, high-strung sister, Nina (Ayelet July Zurer), who is unexpectedly widowed when her new husband, Haimon (Yoram Hatav), is killed in a terrorist attack. Ms. Zurer, whose blend of beauty and spirited eccentricity suggests an Israeli answer to Diane Keaton, is the steadiest light illuminating a film that takes in the topsy-turvy world of contemporary Tel Aviv through an adolescent's distracted glances. The relationship between Nadav and his aunt is stormy and one-sided. She loves him but is so rapt in her own turmoil that she remains unaware of his passion. Nadav's heavy-breathing journal is not his only personal secret. With his friend Menahem (Dov Navon), who must be at least a decade older, he embarks on Peeping Tom expeditions. The movie never questions this relationship, nor does it bother to explain how and when this unlikely pair of voyeurs joined forces. If their perverse partnership is a metaphor for the disorder of urban Israeli life in an atmosphere of siege, it doesn't register very strongly. Nadav's mother, Alona (Anat Waxsman), is a tempestuous, sexually free-spirited fashion designer estranged from her religious husband, Amnon (Shmil Ben-Ari), who is dying of emphysema. The main strand of the movie follows Nina's impulsive marriage and wrenching plunge into widowhood as observed through Nadav's overheated gaze. Some weeks after Haimon's funeral, she has an impulsive one-night stand with Avinoam (Alon Aboutboul), the photographer who notified her of her husband's death. After his night in heaven, Avinoam, a silver-tongued romantic with serious boundary issues, is ready to shuck his fianc�e, a successful artist, and spend his life with Nina. But she is guilt-stricken and refuses to see him again. The boy, identifying with both Haimon and Avinoam, imagines himself betrayed by his aunt and suspends their friendship, much as she cut off her new lover. She, in turn, begins having visions of her late husband peering accusingly through her bedroom window. One afternoon, she sees him running naked down the street. But are these sightings hallucinations? Or is there a Haimon look-alike streaking around Tel Aviv? The biggest weakness in "Nina's Tragedies," which won 11 Israeli Academy Awards, including best picture, best director and best screenplay, is the character of Nadav. Even with his adolescent obsessions, he remains a poker-faced cipher, darting from one scene to the next without emerging as either a person or a coherent point of view. His shadowy presence leaves the movie without a solid center around which to spin its tales.

An amiable, but cluttered dramedy, "Nina's Tragedies" casts an ambitious net that ultimately falls out of the control of writer-director Savi Gabizon. Likable perfs by a strong ensemble cast carry well-made pic (last year's official Israeli Oscar entry) up to a point, and it's easy to see "Nina" traveling far on the fest circuit and perhaps even into arthouses with large Jewish auds.
Pic -- about the chaotic confluence of people and politics in modern-day Israel -- is narrated by a precocious teenage boy, Nadav (Aviv Elkabets). He is consumed by an impossible crush on his aunt Nina (Ayelet July Zurer), whose husband recently died. Pic takes off in a myriad of directions, from a soldier who has a crush on Nina, to a friend of Nadav's who may be a peeping tom. But while Gabizon pulls off some nice fantasy touches and stages one particularly lovely, understated sex scene, he fails at fluidly integrating the disparate pieces of his cinematic puzzle, ultimately making Nadav (who seems intended to offer the film's consistent p.o.v.) a nearly peripheral character.

Will the circle be unbroken? Let's hope not. This poorly conceived sequel to Gore Verbinski 's The Ring  ditches that film's scariest conceitpeople die a week after watching . . . an avant-garde video! for a watery possession plot. Fleeing the gnarliness unleashed in the first movie's Seattle  for small-town life, Rachel (Naomi Watts ) and her weird little son (David Dorfman ) have to fend off bad plumbing, angry deer, and the unshowered ghost girl who keeps ruining his digital photos. Postpartum depression is invoked several times; if the name of the game is to be the unheimlich  maneuvers of the mother-child bond, one wishes Hideo Nakata  (director of the Japanese Ringu  films) could have nudged the proceedings toward the Rosemary's Baby -Birth  axis. (Indeed, there's a brief, wordless melody intended to evoke RB .) Sissy Spacek , as the would-be Andrea Yates  now in the loony bin, is thankfully obscured by a long wig. The let's-travel-through-the-TV-screen sequence was better in Fat Albert  . Next time we'll try call-waiting.
