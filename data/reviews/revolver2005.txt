"Revolver," the latest Guy Ritchie shoot-em-up, is a joke. You laugh with it but mostly at it. He's plucked some quotes from his copy of Bartlett's (Julius Caesar, Machiavelli) and tried to go deep into matters of being. And naturally when you think "ontology," the name "Jason Statham" comes to mind. So Ritchie has Statham, who appeared in the director's first two films, wear a lot of soggy-looking hair to play Jake Green, an extremely well-dressed gambler who finds himself tangled up in one of Ritchie's usual booby-trap plots on his first day out of jail.
The wrinkle is that all Statham does is talk: to himself, to us (via his snarling narration). It's all anybody does, including Ray Liotta as a tan-aholic casino owner with glow-in-the-dark teeth. If I correctly read a newspaper on his desk, this guy's name is Dorothy Macha, and he's trying to get his bags and bags of cocaine back from thieves. The new illegal owners are Avi and Zach, an odd couple played by André "3000" Benjamin and Vincent "Big Pussy" Pastore. They've roped Jake, whom they've told has only three days to live, into being their reluctant partner.
Since Ritchie prefers to shoot first and explain later, none of this makes any sense. That seems deliberate. This is the kind of movie that crawls up a hole in the first scene and never comes out. One of the minor pleasures of "Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch" was how Ritchie turned the underworld power structure into a work of origami. The guy at the bottom could really be near the top, and there was always a surprise lurking in the folds. This new movie is all delusion and frustration: balled-up loose-leaf doing a horrible job of being a paper boat.
"Revolver" does have some wonderful sequences - one bloody passage that morphs into anime, and every scene involving a Chinese crime lord named Lord John (Tom Wu) or a marksman named Sorter (Mark Strong, the best thing in the film). Those sequences pop and bang enough to remind you that Ritchie is at his smartest when he lets the glitz hit the fan. Chaos allows his filmmaking to thrive with its derivatively opulent inanity, like Steven Soderbergh doing a Tarantino knock-off of a Luc Besson picture.
Besson happens to be a producer on this movie. And as with his own films, "Revolver" dies a little whenever anybody says more than a sentence. When Statham and Benjamin wonder about existence or lecture about the con man's nature, there's only one word: eww. Our guiding metaphor is chess, a game the movie wants to bundle into some grand idea about identity, metaphysics, and manipulation. Ritchie is going for a conundrum. But what it all means is indecipherable.
Presumably to clarify everything, to let us know that the movie really is About Something, he concludes his ponderous folly with a series of tacked-on interviews with real, very educated shrinks and thinkers. Peter Fonagy! Deepak Chopra! They explain the ego of a con man. This is laughable only because it stinks of last resort: See, I was totally on to something. But what? "The Usual Suspects 4"?
Ritchie should have tried to cull an actual documentary about the criminal mind from all his footage. But let's be honest: Guy Ritchie should really be out making Bond movies or a new "Ocean's" picture. He should be devising ways to consolidate the emotional breakthrough he made with the beach scenes in his underrated "Swept Away" remake. He should not be thinking about what makes crooks and grifters tick if he doesn't have the equipment to produce an actual thought. Otherwise, he's the con man. We haven't been entertained. We've been had.


The old rap on Guy Ritchie (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels ) is that he makes the same film again and again, and Revolver  starts out in that snazzy-crime vein, as an ex-con (Jason Statham) plots revenge against a well-dressed gambler (Ray Liotta). Then the movie butts up against the director's newfound pretensions  pseudo-philosophical voice-over, psychobabble, faux-art-film plotting  and turns incomprehensible. Ironically, a few deft shoot-outs make you wish he'd just delivered another straight-on Guy Ritchie flick.

 By turns clever, impassioned, incoherent and silly, “Revolver,” the fourth film by the writer and director Guy Ritchie, is a macho parable of a fallen man striving for grace.  Mr. Ritchie’s regular collaborator, Jason Statham, stars as Jake Green, an ex-convict seeking revenge against a malevolent casino owner named Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta). Green hopes to bankrupt Macha by means of “the formula,” an equation he devised in the joint.  After Green embarrasses Macha on his own gaming floor, Macha orders him whacked but is foiled by a mysterious loan shark named Zack (Vincent Pastore of “The Sopranos”). Soon after, Zack and his dapper partner, Avi (André Benjamin), inform Green that he has a fast-acting, fatal disease and hint that there’s a world beyond the one he can see.  “Revolver” doesn’t stint on fun. Mr. Pastore’s terse ultimatums and Mr. Benjamin’s silky exposition are a hoot. Mr. Statham adds another vivid panel to his gallery of smart brutes. As Sorter, a stoic gunman with superhuman hearing, Mark Strong steals every scene he’s in. As Macha, a decadent, insecure sadist, Mr. Liotta conveys spiritual anguish while clad in bikini briefs and eyeliner, a feat that Ingmar Bergman never asked of Max von Sydow.  Yet the movie clearly has so much more on its mind than escapism that viewers may demand, “Who is this director, and what has he done with Guy Ritchie?”  “Revolver” is built around title cards quoting famous philosophers on power, deception, war and chess, and it ends with jejune sound bites from guru figures (including Deepak Chopra). The characters fear an unseen Mr. Gold who variously represents greed, pride, the ego and Satan. The movie’s title teases both the purgatorial cycle of self-limiting thought and the possibility of spiritual evolution (represented by images of cats, crucifixion and sarcophagi). When a major character renounces violence, Mr. Ritchie frames him so that gold leaves on the wall behind his head form a halo.  As if to italicize the notion of the self as protagonist in life, the filmmaker gives Green and Macha narration that anticipates and critiques events and sets the action in a neo-noir dreamland rife with allusive proper nouns. (The macho Macha is a mini- Machiavelli.  Say that five times fast.)  The most audacious bit in “Revolver” is a gunfight in which Sorter uses his hearing to target unseen foes while Mr. Ritchie fractures screen space like a Cubist on a bender. Runner-up is a long scene of Green debating himself in an elevator.  The movie’s hit-to-miss ratio is hardly Olympic caliber, but Mr. Ritchie deserves credit for chutzpah. After his third film, “Swept Away” — a putrid remake of the Lina Wertmüller classic starring his wife, Madonna — he could have photocopied his two hits, “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” and “Snatch,” and been credited with a return to form.  He chose instead to make a film whose DVD version could plausibly be filed under “action,” “mystery,” “religion” and “self-help”: the first metaphysical lad-mag movie.  “Revolver” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for pretty much everything.

Guy Ritchie shoots a blank with "Revolver," which replays the low-life criminal shtick from his first two features with an ill-advised overlay of pretension. The action, attitude and wise-guy talk all feel moldy this time around, which does not bode well for U.S. release, although helmer's following and rep of producer Luc Besson will probably spark better B.O. in certain international territories.
It's usually not a good thing when an all-style, no-content director like Ritchie decides to get self-serious. Alas, that's what happens here, as he inundates the viewer at the outset with aphorisms on war and the art of the con, only to repeat them again and again over the course of two hours.
It all has to do with the con of all cons, of which Jake Green (Ritchie stalwart Jason Statham) believes he's now capable after having spent seven years in prison situated between cells occupied by a chess master and a top con artist. First stop after he's released is the casino of the confoundingly named Dorothy Macha (Ray Liotta), who wronged Jake before and whom Jake now humiliates at the tables.
Macha soon orders a hit on Jake, who in turn is taken under the wing of the mysterious team of Zack (Vincent Pastore), an old-style Mafia type, and Avi (Andre Benjamin), whose smooth doubletalk often threatens Jake but mostly leaves him thoroughly in the dark about what's going on.
He's not alone. Despite plenty of narration from Jake and gobs of flashy flashbacks, the only thing that's clear through is that Ritchie won't be doing much clarifying before the final cards are played. The big hint comes via a quote attributed to Julius Caesar to the effect that your enemy will always hide in the last place that you would ever look.
Well, OK, presumably that would be in your own house, or, since Jake doesn't seem to have a house, maybe in his own head. Assuming that's a good guess, it would mean that he's his own worst enemy, which is a level of profundity Ritchie has a great deal of difficulty communicating in an entertainingly edifying way -- especially since there are quite a few guys with guns who could do damage to Jake before he gets a chance to harm himself.
The more convoluted and philosophical things get, the more tedious "Revolver" becomes. There is intermittent amusement provided by a surefire hit man's emotional crisis, torture by nail in the hand, the hit man overcoming his crisis in spectacular fashion, Liotta hyperventilating in Speedos, and Francesca Annis doing a no-doubt unwitting impersonation of Edna Mode from "The Incredibles" as the front person for uber-boss Mr. Gold (wasn't the use of colors for gangsters' last names retired by Quentin Tarantino a long time ago?).
The setting is a deliberately fudged mid-Atlantic gambling-and-crime zone that looks like a cross between London and Las Vegas. (Much of the pic was shot on the Isle of Man.) The grandiose yet tacky production design, rather grubby lensing and even Strathan's stringy long hair and beard don't help make the proceedings cool enough to overlook the silliness of the whole enterprise. Ritchie's fancy cutting and storytelling techniques still evince a degree of cheeky flair, but they're in dire need of being applied to fresher material.

For any high-fivin' "Movies for Guys Who Like Movies" bros hoping for the Guy Ritchie  of yore, Revolver  disappoints. It's no return to rock, this, but rather Ritchie's soporific, proggy-conceptual Film of Ideas, with Vivaldi  interludes, fussbudget set design, recurrent references to chess, and a hit man inexplicably got up as Tati's Mr. Hulot. Hobbling stateside after a raping from the U.K. press, Revolver 's nothing if not eccentric; at times, I halfway admired the suicidal gambit of making such a gnomic self-actualization gangster pic. All the crime-saga tropes are accounted forthe ronin badass, feuding rival gangs, an invisible criminal overbossbut they do double-duty as allegorical points on the film's schematic layout. Jake Green  (Jason Statham ) is no sooner released from prison than he's back feuding with casino sleaze Dorothy (Ray Liotta , explosively deviant), but things swiftly go down the rabbit hole as he's indentured to and lectured by a mysterious duo of loan-shark gurus (Andre Benjamin  and Vincent Pastore ). The plot's hieroglyphic symbolism adds up, finally, to some kind of lesson about the Ego, a fact confirmed by a line-up of Ph.D.'s (and Deepak Chopra ) who pop on-screen to tell you exactly that before the credits roll.
