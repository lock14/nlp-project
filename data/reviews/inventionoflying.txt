With “The Invention of Lying,’’ the British comic actor Ricky Gervais has come up with a wickedly funny idea for a movie  - and then purged the wickedness right out of it. A sharp-edged, cameo-studded fantasy set in an alternate Earth where everyone tells the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, the film explores the power of one little lie that leads to other, bigger lies that ultimately lead to fabricating an entire system of religious belief.
That’s right: “Invention’’ is a mainstream movie that posits God as man’s most desperately inspired leap of imagination. Cheeky monkey. With such big game in their sights, though, the filmmakers shift their aim and instead bag a sweet but toothless romantic comedy, the kind we’ve seen many, many times before. “The Invention of Lying’’ is a disappointment, then: Not the Ricky Gervais breakthrough that he and we deserve, but merely another promising holding maneuver.
That said, there are laughs here, dodging amateurish filmmaking and story construction while managing to hit their targets. Gervais shares scripting and directing credit with writer-comedian Matthew Robinson, and their setup is a good one: What if the imagination required to deviate from the facts had never evolved? And what would happen if one average schmo figured out the benefits of saying something that wasn’t true?
Everyone would believe him, of course; they wouldn’t be able to do otherwise. Mark Bellison (Gervais) comes up with his first whopper  - a minor bit of larceny  - and both he and the movie dance with delight at the possibilities. Sex with beautiful women? As long as you tell them the world will end right now. Free money, cars, houses? Provided you can construct the right lie, it’s all yours.
What lies can’t buy is love, since it doesn’t actually exist in this world. Mark is sweet for a leggy ditz named Anna (Jennifer Garner), who thinks he’s rather nice but won’t risk the genetic possibility of kids who might look like him. (She’d rather date Mark’s rival, a preening sleaze played by Rob Lowe.)
It’s a lie told to benefit someone else that gets the hero into his hottest water: Mark calms his dying mother (Fionnula Flanagan) with a vision of a place up above among those she loves and, presto, he has invented Heaven. The media camps out on his door, demanding to know what else he knows, and, frazzled, he comes up with a Big Man in the Sky. And they believe that
.
God knows we could use a good religious satire, but “The Invention of Lying’’ isn’t it. The film delightfully explores what pop culture would look like without its necessary untruths: Movies consists of lectures about historical events (Mark, a screenwriter by profession, is stuck with the Black Plague) and advertisements run along the lines of “Pepsi: When They Don’t Have Coke.’’ Retirement homes are called “A Sad Place for Hopeless Old People.’’
Once Mark uncorks his revelations, though, the movie loses its nerve. “The Invention of Lying’’ feels small-scale in more ways than one: The budget isn’t there for the necessary epic vision (although Lowell and the other Massachusetts locations look great), the editing stutters and starts, and the hero spends too much effort chasing a woman who isn’t worth his or our time. In one scene, Mark tells Anna all the beautiful things he sees within her, and the problem is that we
 don’t see them. Like everyone else in this fact-obsessed world, Anna’s actually pretty unpleasant.
“The Invention of Romance’’? That might have made a more honest title. The movie stumbles in that direction when it’s not halfheartedly skewering faith or dumping on Mark for being a “fat, snub-nosed loser.’’ Methinks Gervais protests far too much with such Chaplinesque bids for pathos. Anyone who can call on  Tina Fey, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Edward Norton, Jonah Hill, Jason Bateman, and Christopher Guest for one-shot appearances is no loser. And that’s the truth.

The truth? Ricky Gervais' jolting philosophical comedy The Invention of Lying  is seriously subversive. What other rom-com would spend so much time making a convincing case that   belief in an afterlife is a harmless load of bollocks? Much less one starring a radiant Jennifer Garner as a pretty lady looking to marry a pretty man and make pretty children (which theoretically leaves a disappointed Gervais out of the running as a beau)? In a hilariously literal- minded society where people can't help but speak the truth, Gervais is the one guy who realizes that lies can be useful. Wait, it's deeper than that: Without lying  or ''making things up,'' if you'd prefer a more uplifting spin  our hero demonstrates that there'd be a lot of hurt, hopeless people on earth, and no good screenplays.
Perhaps only Gervais  the inconvenient-truth teller from the BBC's The Office  and Extras , the dry voice of reason on awards shows  could argue the pros and cons of   lying so well, attracting a hip cast that includes Rob Lowe, Louis C.K., and Tina Fey   to back him up. Honesty compels me to say that the tech aspects are often muddy. (Gervais makes a behind-the-camera debut, codirecting and co-writing with newcomer Matthew Robinson.) But the performances are razor sharp. And the ideas in this movie are, no kidding, big.


 Correction Appended  How dreary realism is! Oscar Wilde more or less wrote that once upon a time, and now Ricky Gervais has more or less hit upon that same conclusion. With “The Invention of Lying,” a mostly funny if melancholic defense of deceit, Mr. Gervais has come up with the makings of a classic. Alas, making is not doing. And while the movie is a conceptual pip filled with quotable laughs and gentle pokes at religious faith at its most literal, it also looks so shoddy that you yearn for the camerawork, lighting and polish of his shows, like the original “The Office,” because, really, these days TV rarely looks this bad.  Hey, I’m just being honest, in keeping with the movie’s comic premise. Mr. Gervais stars as Mark Bellison, a sad sack and screenwriter who lives in a world that looks a lot like our own, only sleepier, less shiny and with no visible security cameras. The defining characteristic of this somewhat bland storybook land, with its calm streets and token homeless man, is that no one ever tells an untruth, not lovers or friends, bosses or assistants, moviemakers or advertisers. While that makes for some awkward moments, it also makes for some initially fine comedy. The tagline for Coke here is simple, elegant, true: “It’s very famous.” While an ad for Pepsi just concedes the obvious: “When they don’t have Coke.”  For a frump like Mark, whose rounded, sagging shoulders suggest that he’s never recovered from his schoolyard torments, honesty breeds contempt but mostly humiliation. When he goes on a first date with a beauty, Anna (Jennifer Garner), she opens the door and announces, “I was  just  masturbating.” To which he replies, “That makes me think of your vagina.” This, in turn, makes her run upstairs and finish what she started. And so it embarrassingly, amusingly goes, as the mismatched couple, both honest to an excruciating and painful fault, dine at a restaurant where the hostess blurts out that she’s threatened by Anna, and a waiter begins service with the matter-of-fact announcement that Anna is out of Mark’s league.  Anna  is so out of his  league that she’s in another game entirely, but because the moviemakers want to have their fun and their Hollywood ending both, much of the story involves getting these two together. That’s generically diverting, but the better, smarter, more ticklish stuff in the movie involves the simple truth that a world without lying is also one without art. Over at Lecture Films, where Mark struggles as a writer, the movies are based only on true events, like the black plague. Narrated by stuffed shirts (Christopher Guest in whiskers) seated  in armchairs and pompously droning into the camera, this is cinema without fictional embellishment, heaving bosoms, rustling crinolines, passion, pleasure or intrigue, kind of like “Masterpiece Theater” without Evelyn Waugh or the Brontës.  Or Oscar Wilde, for whom lying (“the telling of beautiful untrue things”) was “the proper aim of art.” That’s an intoxicating, rich idea that Mr. Gervais, who wrote and directed the movie with an American newcomer, Matthew Robinson, exploits minimally. (This is the first movie directing gig for both men.) That’s too bad, because some of the sweetest moments are of Mark lying or rather exercising his imagination, as when he tenderly tells a dying woman that there’s more than the  void on the other side. Or when he summarizes the first fictional script, which features ninjas and aliens and sounds like something Roger Corman cooked up in the 1950s. In these scenes, lying becomes a means to transcendence, an escape from the quotidian, from our oppressive literal-mindedness, from our brute selves.  For the most part, though, Mr. Gervais prefers to shock us with our own brutality. Some of these jolts are delivered through dialogue exchanged by performers  —  among the appealing guest stars are Jason Bateman, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Jeffrey Tambor  —  blurting the awful truth while stranded inside the inert, ugly setups. At other times  the bad news arrives on a sign, like that on a nursing home that reads “A Sad Place for Hopeless Old People.” You wince, you laugh, you wince again. At some point, though, these unvarnished truths begin to feel heavy, cruel. The truth doesn’t just hurt  —  sometimes it’s also degrading, and not just for the characters. The movie encourages our inner bully, coaxing it out for giggles.  That’s the idea, I suppose: the filmmakers want the audience to feel the sting of these blunt verdicts, largely it seems so that Mr. Gervais can later tut-tut us about how mean and wrong we’ve been. In “Extras,” his hilarious television series about life on the show business margins, Mr. Gervais played a professional narcissist (an actor) who, after a long  slog, hits the B-ish list only to then wag his finger at everyone (us included) for being so obsessed with fame. He’s following a similar strategy here by playing the nominal loser turned triumphant conscience, and while that’s fine as far it goes, the movie itself would have gone further if he and Mr. Robinson had worked harder on their own sweet lies  —  their art.  “The Invention of Lying” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Sexual innuendo, booze, insults.

While it never tops the explosive hilarity of its first 20 minutes, "The Invention of Lying" is a smartly written, nicely layered comedy that, like last year's underappreciated "Ghost Town," casts Ricky Gervais as a mild-mannered schlub who manages, in spite of himself, to make the world a better place. Set in a parallel reality where dishonesty doesn't yet exist, the pic works better as a high-concept satire than as a romantic pairing for Gervais and Jennifer Garner. But those 20 minutes, and much of what follows, are simply inspired, portending modest-to-decent biz for this Oct. 2 Warner Bros. release.
Written and directed by Gervais and first-timer Matthew Robinson, the film unfolds in a universe where human beings have never evolved the ability to tell lies, or even fudge the facts a little. From the moment portly Mark Bellison (Gervais) arrives to pick up slim beauty Anna (Garner) for their first date -- whereupon she greets him with a sunny "Hi! I was just masturbating" -- it's clear that Gervais and Robinson have struck comic gold with their conceit of having normal, everyday people casually blurt out every thought that occurs to them, no matter how inconvenient or embarrassing.
Embarrassment doesn't seem to have been invented yet, either -- though that doesn't make things easier for Gervais' Mark, a down-on-his-luck screenwriter who's forced to swallow the shockingly blunt yet socially acceptable insults (almost always some variation on "You fat loser") hurled at him by his peers. These include an arrogant rival scribe, Brad (a sneering Rob Lowe); sharp-tongued secretary Shelley (Tina Fey); and even Anna, who tells Mark that while she enjoys his company, she doesn't want "chubby, snub-nosed kids."
The early reels are a marvel of sustained comic invention and verbal wit, with a dash of speculative humor that borders on science fiction. Bus ads and building signage offer priceless sight gags (a retirement home bills itself as "a sad place for old hopeless people"), while the movies Mark writes are essentially unvarnished history lessons, read directly to the camera with nary an ounce of Hollywood artifice.
But everything changes, including the pic's tone and momentum, when Mark, fired and broke, catches a lucky break by telling the world's first lie. Shocked by his newfound powers, Mark finds himself the hero of a sort of reverse "Liar Liar," in which his every fabrication is accepted at face value. Before long, Mark is back at work, Anna renews her interest in him and -- in a twist that approaches Capra-esque levels of sentimental lunacy -- he becomes a celebrity with his revelatory, gotta-be-true insights into the nature of God, morality and the afterlife.
Gervais and Robinson are in fascinating satirical territory here, and they stop just short of saying there's no greater lie than the idea that life has any eternal meaning or value. Yet while they offer food for thought, their approach remains disarmingly sweet, breezy and good-humored; even when the pic threatens to turn either serious or sticky, it always has a terrific gag or non sequitur up its sleeve.
The final half-hour, in which Anna tries to decide whether Mark is the one for her, feels belabored and anticlimactic in its deference to romantic-comedy conventions, and the story's internal inconsistencies begin to show. But even the later scenes add a wrinkle to this unexpectedly thoughtful comedy: namely, that our superficial perceptions of reality may, in fact, be very far from the truth.
Gervais' overweight-Everyman shtick shows no sign of getting (ahem) thin, while Garner has touchingly vulnerable moments as a woman who's more in Mark's league than either of them realizes. Louis C.K. offers excellent backup as Mark's best bud, while the supporting cast is an embarrassment of cameo riches, boasting brief, memorable turns from Philip Seymour Hoffman, Edward Norton, Jason Bateman, Martin Starr and many others. Tech package is bland but sturdy.

The Invention of Lying 's plot hook sounds like a pile-up of Jim Carrey –Tom Shadyac  concept comedies. The assumption is that there isn't much crossover between the Liar, Liar  and Ricky Gervais  fan bases. Gervais's fuzzy parable exists in an alternate universe in which nobody has made a word for "truth," because nobody tells anything but—until one man discovers how to say "things that aren't."
That man is The Office  's auteur, also co-writer/co-director here. As in that calling-card work, Lying  is interested in self-deception as a survival technique. The undressed, undeceptive, utterly honest world is no Eden: flat lighting, earth tones, beige bachelor flops, blank-walled offices, bland daytime barrooms. The lack of ornament extends to this world's idea of entertainment. No lies means no fiction. Moviegoers attend Lecture Films releases, in which actors recite on a historical topic from a teleprompter.
Gervais's Mark is a Lecture scriptwriter, assigned the unpopular, plague-dreary 13th century—a job to fit his raw deal of a life. He's single, with the podgy build that drives girls wild, and a smushed, porcine nose. On doomed dates with Anna (Jennifer Garner , perkily sadistic), she misses no chance to tell him this is plain bad genes. Truth-telling is compulsive, conquering the most basic acts of self-censoring. A waiter introduces himself with "I'm very embarrassed I work here." A roadside sign advertises "A Cheap Motel for Intercourse With a New Stranger." For a middle-aged also-ran like Mark, who needs all the help he can get, the flatteries and shadowed truths of seduction are impossible. Honesty is so clearly not Mark's best policy that he suddenly, inexplicably snaps, learns to fib his way out of a mess, and keeps going.
The main difference between our world and his—which, we learn, has produced its own Napoleon, industrial revolution, and a familiar Western Massachusetts—is that it's never had any Judeo-Christian tradition. One may wonder, then, where Mark's 13th century is being dated from. The casual introduction suggests you shouldn't think too hard about the premise's inconsistencies, but maybe the filmmakers should've thought harder. By designing Lying 's universe to so closely parallel our own instead of reimagining history on truth serum, they overlook punch lines for the movie's repetitive setup.
Basically a good sort, Mark uses his gift to ameliorate the sting of the matter-of-fact on the meek—nobody here has heard the old "Everything's going to be all right" before, and it's a revelation. In a moment of unction, Mark improvises the comforting idea of heaven, along with a Man in the Sky making up the guest list. Playing to a more credulous public than Jesus, he doesn't need miracles, and the viral spread of TV news makes him an overnight prophet. Scripture is re-enacted as broad farce. Mark delivers his Ten Commandments on pizza boxes; he's resurrected from his depression with Christ-like shag and beard. At times, it feels as if Gervais has made a freethinker Lecture Film of his own, as two-dimensional in its smug secularism as Bruce Almighty  was in its vacation Bible-school pandering.
When the jokes based on universal social ineptitude wear with use, the film remembers unrequited love. Mark pines for Anna, who wants to want Mark, but honestly  wants the alpha seed of a predatory Rob Lowe . The presence of Jonah Hill —mercifully tranquilized as a suicidal neighbor—recalls School of Apatow  comedy, as does Lying 's lesson in looking past surfaces, delivered by the ultimate pairing of a knockout girl and the schlubby mate she has learned to see the beauty in—not exactly Marty , this.
Gervais plays schlub beautifully, testing and discarding a dozen ineffective inflections, sweetly suppliant in hurt. As with celebrity guest–heavy Extras , he has called in favors here—Tina Fey , Philip Seymour Hoffman , and Edward Norton  all show up, all wasted as dull foils. Likewise, Lying  brushes more big ideas than commonplace comedies, but hasn't taken those ideas through enough drafts to work out their implications or—harder still—make them killingly funny.
