         As they near the end of their yearlong tour in Iraq, a group of National Guard soldiers from Spokane, Wash., banter cynically, and one compares the region to a "big pot of . The more you stir it, the more it smells."
 
 "Home of the Brave" promises home truths about the war in Iraq, and it isn't long before the air turns foul. Just after word of their homebound flight comes through, the soldiers are called out on a final mission, an escort run that turns into a bloody ambush. In other words, no sooner has the movie announced its pretensions to gritty realism than it hauls out the hoariest irony in the screenwriting handbook. The soldier who waxes lyrical about what he'll do when he gets home is as doomed as a movie cop who has just announced his retirement.
 


         






   Touted as the first fiction feature to address the Iraq War, "Home of the Brave" is unfailingly earnest in its desire to generate sympathy for the conflict's returning veterans. But the movie, directed by veteran producer Irwin Winkler, who shares story credit with screenwriter Mark Friedman, so often falls back on stock situations and familiar tropes that it rarely addresses the specifics of the current conflict. Even when it's treading virgin territory, "Home" feels awfully familiar.
 
 The victims of fate and contrivance, the Guard soldiers return to Spokane in rocky shape. Tommy (Brian Presley) cannot forget watching his best friend die, while Jamal (Curtis Jackson, a.k.a. 50 Cent) lives with the memory of the innocent Iraqi woman he gunned down in a firefight. Will (Samuel L. Jackson), a combat medic, drowns his traumas in alcohol, lashing out at his wife and pacifist son. Vanessa (Jessica Biel) struggles with her new prosthetic arm, as well as the fact that the boyfriend she has returned home to can no longer look her in the eye.
 
 Although they barely knew each other in Iraq, the soldiers find they have more in common with each other than their sympathetic but uncomprehending friends and families. Visiting a movie theater to escape from her troubles, Vanessa recognizes Tommy working in the ticket booth (he came home expecting to resume his old job at a gun shop, but his former boss has illegally failed to hold his job for him, and Tommy is too disheartened to press his grievance). The two combat veterans sneak off for a private moment, but rather than swap war stories, they compare notes on anti-depressants, which they're apparently taking by the handful. Among the movie's more overtly dramatic set pieces, this brief exchange stands out for its quiet truthfulness.
 
 "Home of the Brave's" evident inspiration is William Wyler's "The Best Years of Our Lives," which dramatized the bittersweet homecomings of three World War II veterans. Winkler is timid about suggesting culprits for his soldiers' malaise. The closest he comes is having a desperate Jamal rail against the paperwork he has to fill out to get proper psychiatric counseling. Wary of offending either the left or right, "Home of the Brave" blandly plays it safe. War is hell, but what can you do?
 
 The movie's mild-mannerness is especially disappointing when compared with such documentaries as "The War Tapes" and the excellent "Home Front," vivid and incisive explorations of post-Iraq anger and disillusionment that have gone largely unseen by a disinterested public. If Americans are suffering from Iraq fatigue, "Home of the Brave" will do little to rouse them.

Irwin Winkler cribs from the best in Home of the Brave   unfortunately, he's copied the wrong masterpiece at the wrong time. And he's done so with a crayon. As a result, he's ended up with a Hallmark TV drama about the very antithesis of a Hallmark moment.
With William Wyler's powerful 1946 Oscar winner The Best Years of Our Lives , about GIs returning from WWII, as a guide, the veteran Rocky  producer-turned-director follows the bumpy progress of National Guard soldiers returning from war in Iraq to peace in Spokane, Wash. Having survived a devastating ambush in the last days of their tour, when others in their unit did not, the vets come home to a blithe American dailiness now infuriatingly alien to them. Among them, a tough surgeon (Samuel L. Jackson) buries sadness with liquor. An athletic single mother (Jessica Biel) rages at her permanent physical wounds. A gentle guy tormented by back pain and haunted by his participation in the bloodshed (Curtis ''50 Cent'' Jackson) rapidly unravels.
The movie's aims are compassionate and respectful  noble, even, in the desire to pack as much info (about amputees, about vet support groups) into the unsubtle, expository script by Mark Friedman. But evenness of political keel, combined with a generic filmmaking style, is an artistic weapon way too puny for a successful assault on so tough, bruising, and crucial a subject.

 The kindest description of “Home of the Brave,” the first Hollywood movie to examine the experience of American soldiers returning from Iraq, might be that it is fueled by noble intentions.  Directed by Irwin Winkler from a script by Mark Friedman, a first-time screenwriter, it wants to be a smaller-scaled, contemporary “Best Years of Our Lives.” And two of its characters — one who has lost a hand and another who can’t settle down — carry echoes of that 1946 William Wyler classic. But as this cautious, politically evenhanded movie grinds along like clockwork, the fuse that should spark an emotional explosion fizzles after some sporadic hisses and sputters. Most of those noises emanate from Samuel L. Jackson as Will Marsh, a glowering, embittered Army medic who, once he is stateside, develops a drinking problem.  By the end of “Home of the Brave,” you may feel as if you have just sat through an earnest made-for-television movie featuring actors who are too pretty to be real people dutifully recycling a formula. Devoid of personality, their tidy cut-and-paste speeches have the ring of carefully composed and edited distillations of previous home-from-the-front movies.  Functional clockwork is not to be confused with good timing. “Home of the Brave” feels both premature and hopelessly stale: premature because so many thousands of American troops remain in Iraq with no timetable for an exit, and stale because the drama suggests a pallid imitation of the real thing so easily found in documentaries like “The War Tapes.” “Home of the Brave” suggests that when the time comes for Hollywood to take on the war in Iraq, those documentaries are going to pose a serious challenge to filmmakers seeking credibility.  In the early scenes, set in southeastern Iraq (and filmed in Morocco), members of a National Guard unit rejoice at the news that they are about to be demobilized. But before they return to their hometown of Spokane, Wash., they are dispatched on a final humanitarian mission in the town of Al Hayy.  Because not a word is spoken nor an action taken in the movie that isn’t entirely predictable, you know that they will be ambushed. And in the battle sequence that follows, the life of one driver, Vanessa Price (Jessica Biel, as bland as she is impeccably coiffed), is saved by Will after an explosion blows up her jeep. But she loses a hand. Another soldier, Tommy Yates (Brian Presley, looking soap opera ready), witnesses his best friend’s death.  Then suddenly we’re back in the States, where, after their welcome-home parties, the traumatized soldiers stew and sulk while loved ones question them worriedly and try to understand. The dialogue is so wooden you almost expect to hear “the horror, the horror.” As they try to adapt to civilian life, the movie too insistently splices their everyday experiences with flashbacks of their war experiences.  Will hits the bottle, battles his hostile teenage son (Sam Jones III) and drives his wife, Penelope (Victoria Rowell), to the end of her patience. If the father-son scenes feel stiffly contrived, Mr. Jackson and Ms. Rowell at least strike a few angry sparks. Meanwhile Vanessa, a single mother, rejects her old boyfriend and tries to pretend that life, despite a prosthetic hand, is the same as it was before. The movie conveniently invents a Mr. Right who works at the school where she teaches. Tommy discovers that his old job in a gun store has been taken, and he is pushed by his bullying father to be a police officer, but nothing he tries seems to stick.  With his scenes crudely shoehorned into the movie, Curtis Jackson  (the rap star 50 Cent) plays Jamal Aiken, a lighted stick of dynamite with whom Tommy clashes in a group therapy session. Jamal soon goes ballistic and has a melodramatic standoff with the police at a fast-food outlet.  Yes, the movie has action and high drama, but most of it feels synthetic. Consider “Home of the Brave” an honorable dud.  “Home of the Brave” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity, scenes of violence and one sexual situation.
Like everyone else in Irwin Winkler 's beyond-earnest weepy, homeboy hurts and means it; the film is as sincere as a three-legged puppy. Less Prestige Picture du Jour than Movie of the Week, Home of the Brave  is visually and psychologically scaled for small, intimate, predictable effects. The heart is very much in the right place, but did it have to be placed so far out on the sleeve and must it bleed so profusely? As for its mind, it's not so much that the script by first-timer Mark Friedman  has nothing new to say, which it doesn't, but that Winkler's emotional and technical resources are so middling he settles for it, leaving cast and crew to glide through bromides, coast along on the facile and formulaic.
Brian Presley  plays Tommy, a prettyboy grunt in a National Guard  unit and first-hand witness to the death of a friend when a humanitarian mission goes awry in Al Hayy , Iraq (Morocco ). One minute it's all Arab boys with lollipops, the next a barrage of sniper fire, grenades, and booby-trapped corpses. War is hell! (And ain't it exciting?)
Nearby, Vanessa Price  (Jessica Biel ) narrowly escapes shredding by roadside bomb, managing to crawl from her wrecked jeep with the help of medic Will Marsh  (Samuel L. Jackson )I'm sick of these motherfucking IEDs in this motherfucking war! Price will lose a hand. Marsh will hit the bottle.
Star-spangled to death, all are demobilized home to Spokane , Washington, where the film tracks their hard road back to civilian life, arranging for crossed paths and big scenes. Tommy attends a counseling group frequented by Jamal, worked up in relentless Angry Black Man mode, and later runs into Vanessa at the multiplex where he's taken a job in the box office. The futility of the settingselling spectacle to ambivalent civiliansis nicely played against their plaintive bond and talk of shared medications.
Winkler's best material plays out chez Marsh, where two more clichésthe rebellious son (Sam Jones III ) and the tough yet tender wife (Victoria Rowell )approach genuine feeling. There's a fine scene in which Rowell bitch-slaps her spouse out of a self-pitying stupor, and an even better one in which father defends son's right to wear a "Buck Fush" T-shirt in class. Might as well have read "Impeach Nixon ." For all its relevance to the state of the nation, Home of the Brave  is convinced it's saying something urgent but offers no fresh insight to postwar survival.
An obvious failure, but an honorable one. Blunt as it is, the movie avoids partisan grandstanding and easy irony; I much prefer its simple heart to the exploitative cynicism of an embarrassment like Blood Diamond . The decision to hem close to the texture of daily life is the right one; there's just no texture to speak of. Biel brings a lot to her role, but her role gives little back: the pangs of a sports enthusiast who now has trouble picking up a soccer ball etc.
Presley, miscast, is given the film's final and most complex gesture. Bounced from job to job, irrevocably displaced, Tommy decides to re-enlist. Neither heroic nor despairing, his concluding monologue, in the form of a letter home, poses the first real challenge to the audience. Too little too late, Home of the Brave  earns one tough idea in spite of itself.
