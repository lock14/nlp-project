After 18 seasons, the longest-running sitcom on television has decided to take its act to the megaplex. And now that "The Simpsons Movie" is upon us, the occasion prompts an inevitable question. What would a movie accomplish in 87 minutes that the show -- this great, ingenious circus of subversion -- hasn't in more than 8,000?

It would be a stretch to call "The Simpsons Movie" more than a crisper, livelier-looking episode of the series. The change in mediums changes nothing. The show doesn't see a bigger screen and a longer running time as any kind of a challenge. Could it be that our standard for good movies is now lower than our standard for good television? "The Simpsons" certainly helped alter those dynamics: Its brilliance isn't just its shrewdness and audacity, it's that the show could be so brilliant with such economy. Tellingly, "The Simpsons Movie" is very good for the first 30 minutes.

The movie is not newly ambitious. It's not attempting to explain itself to the uninitiated. Except for the band Green Day, no one dies. No higher truths are revealed. It extends the series' continuum without reaching for the stratosphere. It is, in a sense, disposable, and the filmmakers seem fine with this. Eleven of the show's veteran writers are credited, and their script doesn't strain to reinvent or re-characterize the show. Directed by David Silverman and made with a sincere eco-mindedness, it merely localizes the old global catastrophe plot.

Homer adopts a pig. He fills a silo with its doodie and his own. (Even by his standards, Homer's idiocy reaches record highs.) He dumps the silo in Lake Springfield, which was already lethally toxic (it swallowed Green Day). Some poor pink squirrel jumps in and pops out a many-eyed monster -- it looks like a Surrealist wedding cake. Soon the government gets involved -- Arnold Schwarzenegger is the president and Albert Brooks makes a splendidly draconian head of the Environmental Protection Agency -- and Springfield is hilariously domed off to prevent disaster.

There is business to occupy the other Simpsons, too. Lisa falls for a fellow environmentalist. Bart finds himself torn between his father's unconditional abuse and the unconditional Christian kindness of Ned Flanders. And Marge's frustration with her husband and with Springfield's quarantining drives her to profanity. But the plot's burden is on Homer, whose responsibility for Springfield's ecological catastrophe is revealed, a development that wins the murderous scorn of the rest of the town. The family flees to Alaska. Needless to say, all the dysfunction will be righted. It's just another day with this family and this town.

While the movie allows for moments of comedic dead space, its asides are often funny. A sequence of Bart skateboarding naked through town cheekily mocks standards of nudity. A song Homer makes up for his new pet ("Spider-Pig") is set to the tune of one of the TV versions of "Spider-Man." It deserves to rival Rihanna's "Umbrella" as the song of the summer.

The regular voice cast is all here. The work of Dan Castellaneta, who's been doing Homer since "The Simpsons" played as brief interludes between sketches on "The Tracey Ullman Show," is still underappreciated. Because the animators have settled on a less than dynamic design strategy, much of what's winning and expressive about Homer comes from Castellaneta's vocal finesse. Julie Kavner finds new registers for Marge's husky whininess. In a speech she gives Homer before she leaves him to save Springfield, the cracks in her voice sound like real pain.

The impetus behind bringing the show to the movies doesn't seem financial or creative, really, just one of prerogative -- a test of disciples' loyalty. As Homer points out in the opening minutes, you'd have to be a moron to pay to watch this movie when you could watch the show at home for free.

That crass momentary put-down of the audience scared me, since one of the reasons people keep coming back to the show is that its makers don't thumb their noses at the viewer. Fans of the show (nerds, hipsters, people who can't find anything better to watch on Sundays at 8 p.m.), exult in the topicality, the free-associative asides (half of most episodes seem set within magnificent parentheses), and the enduring, elastic nature of the many relationships.

Its longevity should make "The Simpsons" seem past its cultural prime. But as long as there's a popular-political culture to skewer and American family dynamics to test, the show's creator, Matt Groening, and his staff will have a show. Catching "The Simpsons" several times after football last season, its laser sharpness brought a tear to my eye. "The Simpsons" is that really good neighborhood restaurant you never go to anymore because it's always been there. But whenever you show up you're embarrassed that you don't go more since it's so much better than where you've been eating. To that end, the movie is patio seating or a dining-room renovation, a gimmick to remind you to come back to the show after the World Series. Which is to say it's extremely belated.

At this point, "The Simpsons" is a show with nothing to prove. There's no chip on its shoulder. It has no case to make for itself. It can stand with "Monty Python" as a great, quotable universe of surrealism and farce. That the show hasn't sailed off into the seas of complacency after all these years is a miracle. But the movie feels a little complacent and stuck. When Trey Parker and Matt Stone made a movie of "South Park" -- 1999's "Bigger, Longer, Uncut" -- they expanded their flat, mean little cartoon world into a cynical, dimensional, exuberantly nasty rebuke to its detractors and the contradictions of popular culture. They reinvented their show for the movies and made a masterpiece.

If there's a problem with the "Simpsons" film, it's that it falls in too easily with one of the great defining traits of the show. On TV, "The Simpsons" magically reboots itself weekly. Locations survive destruction, and the characters withstand all psychological, physical damages. The show's absurdist nature is absolute and absolutely finite. At 8:30, the Etch-a-Sketch is shaken clean. Come back next week for fresh satire. In a different medium, that same principle is underwhelming. Regardless of the diminished premium we've been putting on movies lately relative to television, do we want movies that seem to basically erase themselves?


       



"THE SIMPSONS MOVIE" begins, aptly, with a few scenes from the Itchy and Scratchy movie, a bombastic summer blockbuster based on the ultra-violent cartoon that Bart and Lisa love. At the climax of the movie within the movie, just as Itchy is pumping Scratchy full of nuclear missiles, Homer stands up in the theater and wails, "I can't believe we're paying for something we could get for free on TV. If you ask me, everyone in this theater is a big sucker, especially you."
 


         






    The issue of getting your money's worth seems to have been high on the minds of the show's writers, and with some reason. After 18 years on the air, the creators of the most trenchant, deceptively easy-to-swallow satire in the history of TV wanted to find a topic capacious enough to warrant bumping up the aspect ratio to widescreen. What they've come up with is an end-of-the-world scenario brought on by the town's own carelessness. As Itchy and Scratchy bring the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation, the town of Springfield is nudged to the edge of environmental disaster by its own dumb hand.
 
 In some ways, "The Simpsons Movie" feels a little like the Simpsons movie Lisa might have written. But it's a strange path for the series' star writers to have chosen -- this idea that more existential meant better. Of course, the jokes are pin-sharp and off-the-wall loopy as ever, and many sequences -- such as the one when Homer brings home his beloved new pet pig, and the one in which  Flanders makes Bart a cocoa with about 15 special touches -- are inspired. But once the movie wanders into its contemplation of mortality and meaning, the trenchancy kind of creaks and falls off.
 
 The movie opens with  Green Day performing a benefit concert for Lake Springfield, the most polluted lake in the country. After concluding its  set, the band ventures a few words on the dangers of living near a toxic lake, which naturally, nobody wants to hear. Eventually, the message comes directly from God -- via Grampa speaking in tongues -- a warning to the people of Springfield about a coming disaster involving "a twisted tail, a thousand eyes" and something called "eepah."
 
 If you've seen the Korean toxic monster movie "The Host," you can more or less guess what happens next. Soon Springfield comes to find itself sealed off from the world inside a giant glass dome. When the townspeople find out who was responsible for the straw that broke the camel's back (let's just say Homer is involved), they come after the Simpsons with a vengeance. Like any good apocalypse story, "The Simpsons Movie" is full of strange reversals and portentous signs. You really know it's the end of the world as we know it when Bart begins to wonder if he wouldn't be better off as Flanders' son and when Marge's unfailing loyalty starts to fail. But the most unexpected thing about "The Simpsons Movie" is that although it expands its view to include panoramic Alaskan vistas and a more panoptic view of Springfield than we've seen,  it doesn't push the boundaries  of the TV show in a narrative sense.
 
 Unlike "South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut," "The Simpsons Movie" doesn't venture anything more transgressive than it usually does; it doesn't take the gloves off. Sure, there are jokes equating the U.S. government with the only evil madmen capable of encasing a town in a giant cheese dome, but it's nothing it hasn't done before, and nothing we don't hear every night on "The Daily Show With Jon Stewart."
 
 If anything, the movie feels a little safer (though I should say I stopped watching regularly years ago) than the show, focusing on the individual  crisis and subsequent spiritual growth of each individual Simpson (with the exception of Lisa, who apparently didn't need it).
 
 In some ways, it reminded me of the final "Seinfeld" episode. As much as I laughed throughout, I kept wondering what was with all the emotional lessons. Strangest of all was Homer's retreat to the cave (or igloo, in this case), where he experiences an epiphany and sees himself clearly for the very first time. In fact, "The Simpsons Movie" is basically a conversion narrative, in which Homer's eyes are finally opened to the error of his ways. The turnaround feels like the end of something -- like, say, the series. Because where do you go from an (albeit briefly) enlightened Homer and sensitive Bart? The only place I can think of is off into the sunset.
 
 
 MPAA rating: PG-13 irreverent humor throughout. Running time: 1 hour, 26 minutes. In wide release.   

Forty-two years in the making, 250 speaking character roles, an epic animated parable about sin, redemption, and mail-bearing owls that was first sketched out on the back of a takeout menu with a stubby  pencil circulated among 18 writers who found themselves stranded en masse at Chicago's  O'Hare airport one special Christmas Eve: The Simpsons Movie  can't claim any such spectacle or creation mythology. And that's great news, especially for devotees of the profound and profoundly funny long-running TV show  we who have been wondering (and maybe even worrying) for some time what revered writer-producers James L. Brooks, Matt Groening, Al Jean, and Mike Scully would do with three times the usual space to tell a Simpsons  story.  Would there be radical character development or stunt celebrity participation? Charming, image-enhancing voice-over work from presidential candidate Hillary Clinton? Would there be magic?
Turns out what they've done is make everything bigger, longer, and uncut, but let Homer be Homer, an average American screwup in a recognizable, screwed-up world of hypocrisy and lardy foodstuffs. The best thing about this long-awaited feature-length project, a classic Simpsonian interplay of family psychology, social commentary, and brainy visual and verbal jokes tossed off at rat-a-tat speed, is how relaxed it manages to be (or appears to be  the hard work  is, for the most part, hidden), even as it expands, emotionally, to fill a bigger screen. Aware of its responsibilities to ticket buyers at all times  from the raucously clever opening to the last rewarding frame of the closing credits  this is a project that understands that the best TV-to-movie transitions emphasize depth, not length. When Bart looks at neighbor Ned Flanders with new eyes and thinks about the qualities that make a good father, that counts as big news.
So, yes, there's plot. There's the part where Homer adopts a pet pig and lovingly collects the porker's droppings in a backyard silo and then dumps the silo into Lake Springfield despite dire warnings about the town's looming environmental problems (Lisa Simpson's community lecture about local pollutants, ''An Irritating Truth,'' falls on unmotivated ears). Naturally, Homer doesn't think twice about his crime, because Homer never listens to anything except the chingy-chingy sound of the windup monkey  clanging cymbals that is the soundtrack loop in his little brain. And yes, the toxic calamity gets so bad that the Environmental Protection Agency decides to entomb all of Springfield in an impermeable bubble  for starters. (Under the administration of a certain President Schwarzenegger, the EPA has been co-opted by a rich, ethically unencumbered plutocrat with the resonant name of Cargill, voiced with gusto by Albert Brooks.)
And, well, okay, the Simpson clan manages at one point to escape to Alaska, where there's a delightful moment involving a tap-dancing penguin (not so happy in the end for the penguin, but a thrill for Simpsons  fans who count on the series' barbed pop cultural commentary) and a romantic interlude between husband and wife before family tensions come to a crisis. Also, Homer briefly rides a motorcycle, organizes a team of sled dogs, and embarks on a hallucinogenic trip, in no particular order. And there's a spectacular skateboard  scene that rewards some two decades of loyalty, as a naked Bart streaks past everybody who ever walked the streets of Springfield.
But honestly, the ''action'' sequences sometimes falter, overstaying their welcome and turning into filler, because plot has never been what distinguishes The Simpsons , either on TV or in this movie.  It's the d'oh! s. The Proustian value of doughnuts. The reliability of Homer's boorishness, the Comic Book Guy's obsessiveness, Milhouse's asthma attacks, the pleasures of the genius cast of regulars, voicing all those obstreperous residents. And the way one yellow family of four-fingered individualists  Homer and Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, Grampa, and even the addled dog, Santa's Little Helper  are committed, in the face of all obstacles,  to sticking together.
With limited spiritual help (''This book doesn't have any answers!'' Homer shrieks in church, riffling through the Bible for advice when Grampa falls to the floor in an apparent religious fit), and even less faith in government (''I was elected to lead, not to read,'' declares President Schwarzenegger), the Simpson center does hold. And The Simpsons Movie  sweetly cradles one  great American family.

 Correction Appended  I have long been of the opinion that the entire history of American popular culture — maybe even of Western civilization — amounts to little more than a long prelude to “The Simpsons.” I don’t think I’m alone in this belief. But it does not follow that “The Simpsons Movie” represents a creative peak toward which the show’s 18 seasons and 400 episodes have been a long, slow climb. Let’s keep things in perspective. “The Simpsons” is an inexhaustible repository of humor, invention and insight, an achievement without precedent or peer in the history of broadcast television, perhaps the purest distillation of our glories and failings as a nation ever conceived. “The Simpsons Movie” is, well, a movie.  Don’t get me wrong. It’s a very funny movie, loaded with dumb jokes that are often as funny as the clever ones, and full of the anarchic, generous, good-natured humor that is the show’s enduring signature. From the very start, when Ralph Wiggum stands inside the 20th Century Fox logo and sings along with the company fanfare, to the last frames of the closing credits, “The Simpsons Movie” provides plenty of amusement for both casual fans and hard-core zealots. It is not better than the best episodes — it’s no “22 Short Films About Springfield” or “Homer’s Enemy” or “Krusty Gets Busted” or “Lisa the Vegetarian” — and it doesn’t strain to be. (I’d put it at about the level of “Trash of the Titans,” the 200th episode, with which it shares an environmental theme.)  Instead of trying to top “The Simpsons” or sum it all up, the film’s director, David Silverman (whose association with the series goes back to the days of “The Tracey Ullman Show”) and the writers (who among them have at least a century’s worth of experience on the show) take advantage of the opportunity to go wider and longer. CinemaScope, the wide-screen format developed by Fox in the 1950s to combat the rise of television, turns out to be the ideal way to appreciate the small-screen, small-town paradise that is Springfield. In a variation on the show’s opening sequence, we swoop through the town, seeing it from new angles and appreciating its history and beauty anew.  There are also crowd scenes on a scale rarely attempted on television, spectacles that compensate somewhat for the skimpy screen time granted some of the secondary characters. Everyone has a little, thank goodness, but for my taste there was too much Flanders and not enough Krusty. Less Cletus, please, and more Groundskeeper Willie. And where were Patty and Selma? I will say that the “Itchy and Scratchy” movie at the beginning is pure genius, though.  At this point, the temptation is strong to rifle through my notes and repeat my favorite jokes — to tell you about Bart’s full frontal nudity and Homer and Marge’s bedroom scene and the bomb-defusing robot and the many acts of auto-homage that made my inner Comic Book Guy exclaim, “Oh yeah, I remember that episode.” Instead, I’ll just spoil the plot: Homer does something really stupid. Also, Lisa develops a crush, Bart gets in trouble and Marge expresses concern and disapproval. Sorry.  Homer’s main screw-up is not necessarily more or less idiotic than anything he’s done before. (All I’ll say is that it involves a pig.) The consequences, though, are proportionate to what you might expect from a summer blockbuster action movie. That is, they involve Arnold Schwarzenegger, who has been elected president of the United States; the elite attack forces of the Environmental Protection Agency; and the near-destruction of Springfield. Also motorcycles.  The head of the E.P.A. is voiced by the “Simpsons” stalwart Albert Brooks, but the movie is generally light on celebrity cameos and voice-overs, properly emphasizing the talents of the series regulars (Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith and Nancy Cartwright as the family, with Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer filling out much of the non-Simpson Springfield phone directory). There is Green Day, performing an excellent revved-up version of Danny Elfman’s theme song, but other than that the filmmakers stick to the solid core of family and town, and to the mixture of irreverence and sentiment that has underwritten the program’s longevity.  One of the esoteric pursuits that divert “Simpsons” devotees is what might be called the question of authorship. A movie may be the work of a single, imperial auteur, but a television comedy, more often than not, arises from the collective, at times antagonistic labor of a bunch of writers in a room. It is easy enough to identify the graphic style and populist sensibilities of Matt Groening, and to intuit the sharp, fuzzy humanism of James L. Brooks. But over the years dozens of writers have passed through the bungalows on the Fox lot where “The Simpsons” is written. Many have stuck around, come back after grazing elsewhere or left traces of their influence behind. They are, as a group, responsible for the show’s variety and its consistency, for its high points and its occasional doldrums.  Quite a few storied figures of “Simpsons” history turn up in the movie credits — the screenplay is attributed to Mr. Groening, Mr. Brooks, Al Jean, Ian Maxtone-Graham, George Meyer, David Mirkin, Mike Reiss, Mike Scully, Matt Selman, John Swartzwelder and Jon Vitti, several of whom have served in the crucial and mysterious role of show runner — and this is a sign that the movie is more to its makers than a byproduct or an afterthought.  Except, of course, that it inevitably is. Ten or 15 years ago, “The Simpsons Movie,” which has been contemplated for almost as long as the show has been on the air, might have felt riskier and wilder. But “The Simpsons,” for all its mischief and iconoclasm, has become an institution, and that status has kept this film from taking too many chances. Why mess with the formula when you can extend the brand? Do I sound disappointed? I’m not, really. Or only a little. “The Simpsons Movie,” in the end, is as good as an average episode of “The Simpsons.” In other words, I’d be willing to watch it only — excuse me while I crunch some numbers here — 20 or 30 more times.  “The Simpsons Movie” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has what the official advisory describes as “irreverent humor throughout” as well as brief cartoon nudity.

After 18 years and 400 episodes, �The Simpsons� has developed a wide array of potential moviegoers, from those who still watch to those who once watched to those who don�t watch anymore but now have kids that do. The question is how many will feel inspired to ante up for something so readily available for the price of enduring commercials and Fox�s incessant on-air promotion. Happily, the long-gestating movie itself offers a fine incentive, and Fox�s inspired marketing campaign (7-Eleven becoming Kwik-E-Mart? Genius) should ensure enough curiosity to stuff the studio�s pockets, as it were, with dollars from doughnuts.
Put simply, if somebody had to make a �Simpsons� movie, this is pretty much what it should be -- clever, irreverent, satirical and outfitted with a larger-than-22-minutes plot, capable (just barely) of sustaining a narrative roughly four times the length of a standard episode.
On its face, this is no small accomplishment. The conundrum of expanding a TV program (particularly of the animated variety) to feature size and scope has always posed a tricky proposition -- one conquered by the coarse laughs of �Beavis and Butt-head Do America� and �South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,� but resulting in disappointment with, well, just about everything else.
Neither of those other properties, however, possesses the mass appeal of �The Simpsons,� and the credited team of 11 writers (all of them at one time producers on the show) have incorporated plenty of knowing flourishes the audience will surely appreciate -- among them an especially smart bit at the outset, directly addressing why anyone would pay �to see something we get on TV for free.� Along the way, the writers gleefully bite the hands that feed them at Fox, dismiss Disney as an evil empire, and lampoon U.S. government functionaries as inept buffoons who celebrate finally
 catching somebody they�re pursuing.
Seizing on an environmental theme, the plot hinges on rampant pollution of the local lake, with the thoughtlessness of family patriarch Homer (Dan Castellaneta, who provides no fewer than 10 different voices) yielding an epic screw-up, imperiling the entire town of Springfield.
Under ruthless bureaucrat Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks, credited as A. Brooks), the Environmental Protection Agency declares the commu-nity a quarantined disaster area, prompting the local citizenry to literally march on the Simpson residence with torches and force the whole brood into retreat. It thus falls to Homer to find a way to save the town, in the process redeeming himself in the eyes of his wife Marge (Julie Kavner) and son Bart (Nancy Cartwright), who has grown to feel so neglected by dad that he takes refuge with Bible-thumping neighbor Ned Flanders (Harry Shearer).
There are multiple side plots as well to help flesh out the story, from Grandpa making an ominous prophecy to Homer adopting a pig to daughter Lisa (Yeardley Smith) being smitten with a guitar-playing Irish youth who shares her passion for environmentalism.
For all of that, the movie drags in places. Yet as is invariably the case with �The Simpsons,� the smaller, practically throwaway gags often provide the biggest laughs, whether it�s Tom Hanks� earnest cameo as himself, a �Titanic� riff or Bart�s sure-to-be-talked-about skateboarding sequence, yielding a fleeting but riotous glimpse of animated genitalia. (Despite a PG-13 rating, the humor seldom feels more scabrous than an average episode.)
Technically, the movie capitalizes on its enhanced aspect ratio without altering the show�s fundamental look, though there are moments of computer-generated scale that clearly embrace the feature canvas, employing more than the typical TV toolkit.
�The Simpsons Movie� clearly represented a marketing challenge, and, given the build-up, Fox appears to have been equal to that task. As for magnifying the series without losing its deeply ingrained charms, the producers have mostly passed that test as well, proving their 18-year-old child was ready to go out and face the big bad (theatrical) world.
