         Last year, the venerated jazz pianist Herbie Hancock released "Possibilities," an album of eclectic, headline-grabbing collaborations with artists like Christina Aguilera and John Mayer that was quickly forgotten by anyone who doesn't buy their music at Starbucks. To help us remember, directors Doug Biro and Jon Fine have cut together "Herbie Hancock: Possibilities," a documentary about the studio sessions that feels more like a behind-the-scenes CD promo than a fully realized film.
 
  Instead of using the "Possibilities" sessions as an excuse to throw light on Hancock's nearly five decades of experiments in jazz, funk, R&B and hip-hop, Biro and Fine are mostly content to stay locked in the recording studio, jumping from one star-fueled session to the next. So we watch too much of a forced conversation with Aguilera (who brings the most attitude of any of Hancock's guests) and get none of his techno chatter with electronic music pioneer Brian Eno.
 


         






    The film's best moments are when Hancock isn't collaborating, but theorizing on his own about the creative process. From his years playing with Miles Davis, he tells us, he learned how to go into "areas where we don't know intellectually or musically what the result is." "Possibilities" is compelling only when what Hancock calls the "dark room" of creativity unexpectedly shows up, like when Phish's Trey Anastasio tells him how much neo-hippie jam bands owe to Davis' "Jack Johnson" album (on which Hancock played), and when Hancock compares Irish singer Lisa Hannigan's note choices on "Don't Explain" to those of Davis himself.
 
  Biro and Fine clearly had a treasure trove of footage from Hancock's past to work with — a mesmerizing set by the Miles Davis Quintet on German TV, film of Hancock's '70s futurist funk outfit the Headhunters, Hancock teaching kids about synthesizers on "Sesame "Street" — but "Possibilities" is too wedded to the "making-of-the-album" formula to do anything interesting with it. Throw in a tacked-on Buddhism trip to Hiroshima and Nagasaki and closing credits footage of actor Gina Gershon playing a Jew's harp, and "Possibilities" ends up as a testament to only one thing: a missed opportunity to explore one of the most visionary and influential careers in modern music.

 Herbie Hancock, the renowned jazz musician, has adapted to changing times by continually seeking out and embracing new challenges. For his latest album, "Possibilities," which was released last summer, he invited a variety of pop artists from all over the map, stylistically and geographically, to lend their talents.  Cutting from studio scenes to the occasional live performance and regularly employing  close-up and split-screen, Doug Biro and Jon Fine's documentary portrays the intense collaborative efforts that went into each track in a way that is both intimate and far reaching. (The film will be released on DVD by Magnolia Pictures on Tuesday.)  Christina Aguilera sets the film off on a slightly flat note because of her complete lack of charisma, but makes up for it with a voice of gold. And the artists that follow, including John Mayer, Sting, Carlos Santana and Annie Lennox, are engaging enough to carry movies of their own. (The only one who is out of place is Gina Gershon, who plucks on  a jew's-harp during the end credits.)  Even though the gifted performers occasionally borrow the spotlight, the true star always remains Mr. Hancock, a longtime practitioner of Buddhism who  encourages his adoring colleagues to journey beyond their "comfort zones," resulting in some interactions and freestyle jamming that are truly infectious.

Possibilities," is the title of jazz pianist Herbie Hancock's latest disc, a collection of perfs with more than a dozen musicians known for their pop and rock work. To make the album, which the film chronicles in a way that enhances the album's recordings, Hancock bounced between assimilator and leader while working with Christina Aguilera, Paul Simon, Phish's Trey Anastasio and Annie Lennox. The film is the portrait of a kind and giving man open to all positive ideas that come his way. Docu is getting a token theatrical run to help hypo imminent release of album and DVD.
"Possibilities" will likely draw in only the most hardcore of Hancock's fans, and one wonders if there is enough jazz in the film to satiate viewers who associate the master pianist with "Maiden Voyage," "Canteloupe Island" and Miles Davis' last great acoustic album. There are some interesting clips from Hancock's history, but rather than detail specific moments in his life, "Possibilities" concerns itself with what Hancock was learning or thinking at a particular time. In the settings of "Possibilities," often the most interesting aspects are the conversations about creating.
"The hip stuff is outside the comfort zone," says Hancock, who pioneered fusion with his Headhunters band in the 1970s and made the quintessential break-dancing record, "Rockit," in the '80s. It's one of his many decrees, most of which seem on the money in his attempt to make each session as good as it can possibly be. (The most musical event of the film may well be his mournful duet with saxophonist Wayne Shorter in Japan.) 
With split screens, and a camera that doesn't budge, creating an interesting p.o.v. on the lead character, "Possibilities," with its focus on atmosphere over music-making, is keenly limned to go beyond the usual extra found in a CD/DVD package. Ultimately, though, that's how this pic will be viewed.

Herbie Hancock  is looking damn good for a man in his mid sixties, and he's far from set in his waysthe veteran jazzman proved as much on his 2005 duets album Possibilities , on which he teamed up with Christina Aguilera , Annie Lennox , Trey Anastasio , Wayne Shorter , and Sting, among others. This movie tie-in is considerably less innovative than its subject; with its straightforward track-by-track recording-session clips, it feels like something you'd find on the bonus disc of a deluxe package. Only when Hancock plays with Brian Eno  do we get a look back at some of his innovations, like the '80s hit "Rockit," which integrated synth sounds in ways most jazz players might find disturbing. This is primarily a film for fans of all involved.
