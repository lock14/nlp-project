''Hitch" takes place in a brightly lit New York City where all the men are well groomed and feckless, where all the women nervously clutch a copy of ''He's Just Not That Into You," and where everyone is connected by an invisible grid of instant messages, Blackberry alerts, and Friendster links. It's a place where any potential mate gets Googled, and where men are so scared of being themselves that they're willing to hire a total stranger to do it for them.
Enter Alex Hitchens, aka Hitch (Will Smith). To the women of this candyland Manhattan he's an urban legend, the ''date doctor" they keep hearing about. To his clients, he's a savior who teaches them how to make it from date one to date three without going down in flames. Wholesale lying is not involved -- some minor chicanery to meet the woman, to be sure, after which Hitch coaches his clients into being a better, more attentive version of who they already are. He's a straight eye for the straight dork, and he earns a nice living off it.
It's easy to dismiss ''Hitch," the movie that surrounds Hitch, as predictable, shallow chick-flick fluff. The truth is that's what's good about it. Every so often you simply want a movie set in movie-land, featuring attractive people saying things that, if not witty, at least don't need a laugh track to prop them up, and you want it to play fair within the context of its tiny universe. For most of its running time, ''Hitch" is that movie: a painless romantic comedy that provides Will Smith with an opportunity to do what he does best, which is be Will Smith.
Last year was not a good year to be Will Smith. The actor made an unconvincing hard-nosed action hero in ''I, Robot," and in ''Shark Tale" he played an obnoxious smelt. His best performance was as himself in a brief, charming hospital waiting-room scene in Kevin Smith's ''Jersey Girl," a Ben Affleck movie even Ben Affleck's mother might not have seen. So Smith's already ahead of the game in February.
Hitch keeps running into Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), a gossip columnist for a Post-like tabloid called the New York Standard. Stylish and whip-smart and lonely but afraid to admit it, Sara's a movie cliche that goes back to Rosalind Russell in ''His Girl Friday" and beyond, but Mendes plays her with lived-in wariness and a minimum of goo. The scene in which Sara and Hitch meet meta-cute at a downtown lounge -- literally, since their conversation revolves around what he would 
 say to her if 
 he were trying to pick her up -- is the smartest bit in the movie, and it's Mendes who hones the banter to an edge.
Sara is investigating rumors of the ''date doctor" even as she's unknowingly cozying up to Hitch in a series of disastrous encounters. For his part, he should know that taking a woman jet skiing in New York Harbor works about as well in movies as it would in real life, which is to say not unless you have your shots and a notarized will.
Have I mentioned that Kevin James swims through ''Hitch" like Shamu the Killer Whale doing a water ballet? The star of TV's ''King of Queens" plays the hero's newest referral, an accountant named Albert who peers with terror from the boxy, all-consuming totality of his nerdiness. In the film's biggest stretch, Albert carries a torch for his firm's client, the super-rich, super-fabulous super-celebrity Allegra Cole (supermodel Amber Valletta, proving she can act her way just 
outside of a paper bag). What exact accomplishments Allegra is celebrated for are never specified; she's offered up to us as a kind of Paris Hilton with class, and if your brain doesn't cave in from that contradiction, you are ready for this movie.
Smith and Mendes keep ''Hitch" watchable; James makes it entertaining. I'm not a regular watcher of ''King of Queens" -- all right, I've never seen it -- but I can understand why people might be. James has the forward drive of a trash-compacted Ralph Kramden with some of Ed Norton's random gentility and, here at least, he has a knack for fine-tuned physical comedy that gets you laughing even when the script's not there. So what if you've already seen his best scenes in the TV ads? The angle with which Albert cantilevers toward Hitch as he's learning how to kiss Allegra goodnight is de facto funny no matter the setting.
After a while, the enjoyment leaks out and ''Hitch" starts running on fumes. Director Andy Tennant (''Sweet Home Alabama") doesn't know when to quit, or maybe it's just that the unyielding machinery of Hollywood romantic comedies has him in its death grip. Complications crop up, secrets are bared to the world, the cast mills around waiting for the final clinch so the end credits can roll. A sequence in which Hitch crashes a speed-dating event and angrily tells Sara off is the last worthy moment, and it's also the last to touch the jangling neurotic nerve of modern singlehood that ''Hitch" taps before turning complacent.
For a while, though, the movie looks to be the very model of the modern major date flick, and again, that can be OK even if you're the one stalking into a multiplex carrying the collected essays of Camille Paglia. It's nice to have an anti-''Closer" -- provided, of course, that you've seen ''Closer" -- if only to be reminded of why sex, love, and silly Hollywood romances exist in the first place (because they feel good and because they make us forget about death). ''Hitch" is the kind of singles-bar hookup of a film where you don't have to hate yourself in the morning. Much.


         In "Hitch," Will Smith plays a high-end romance consultant specializing in helping the lovelorn woo and win the women of their dreams in three easy dates. You can tell he's good at what he does by the hotness differential between his thyroidal clients and their hot-off-the-runway love interests — I'm talking about off-the-charts, sitcom-level disparities. Eugenics enthusiasts would recoil in horror. Hitch himself is effortlessly attractive, of course — confident but not slick, charming but not unctuous. He also happens to be squeaky decent: He'll only take on clients who are deeply in love. He's a catch, in other words. In his first role as the lead in a romantic comedy.
 
  Not that you'd know it right away. The movie kicks off with Hitch breaking down the rules of strategic romance for the camera, and for a few heart-stopping moments it seems as though the movie might slide into "Alfie" territory. Luckily, the camera confessions soon recede and "Hitch" gets down to specifics. The "date doctor" meets Albert (Kevin James, "King of Queens") — shy, pudgy, certified. He's the mild-mannered CPA of a beautiful socialite and heiress, Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta, supermodel), whose jet-setting boyfriend was recently busted for cheating by Sara Melas (Eva Mendes), the gossip queen of a major New York tabloid and soon to be Hitch's undoing. With a title like "Hitch," there had to be one, and it's presently revealed that the hero's heart was sealed off to love while in college, when he looked inexplicably like TV's Urkel.
 


         






    As standard character motivation tropes go, that Hitch had his heart broken by his first girlfriend and refused to fall in love again is serviceable, if unimaginative. But it's better than the white-hot trauma that supposedly scarred Sara for life. (Younger sister, skating accident, go figure.) As is probably evident by now, "Hitch" gets into some minor trouble when it ventures into the deep psych stuff, especially when it burdens Smith with monologues stacked with more nuggets of reassuring, easy-peasy wisdom than a display table at an airport bookstore. (There's one speech near the end in which running, leaping, jumping and flying figure prominently as go-for-it metaphors.) But when first-time screenwriter Kevin Bisch and director Andy Tennant veer off the beaten get-girl, lose-girl, get-girl path — which, thankfully, they do often — the script feels taut and springy, and the actors bounce off it like toddlers on a trampoline.
 
  Smith is a gifted comic actor, and seeing him in a lighthearted comedy, his first romantic lead, is a pure pleasure. He could carry the movie on his own, but he doesn't need to — the three other leads more than adequately pull their weight. James is enormously likable and fresh in what must have looked like a fairly rote character on the page. Valletta manages to make the unlikeliest celebrity socialite ever imagined seem believably sweet, warm and centered; and the charismatic Mendes commands the screen like an Italian screen siren from the '50s and '60s. They look like they're having a good time together, which is as much as one can ask from actors in a romantic comedy, and more than they usually deliver. Add to this that they're a quartet and that the happy chemicals seem to float freely in at least three directions. Both couples seem genuinely to like each other, as do Smith and James.
 
  Romantic comedies have become so cannibalistic lately that "Hitch" stands out for what seem like major innovations by comparison. (That's as much a comment on the state of the genre as on the pleasures of this movie, but still, it bears saying). One of them is that "Hitch" is told from a male point of view that doesn't subscribe to the me-hunter, you-stay-in-cave school of intrinsic sexuality (a theory that still seems to thrive among members of the writers and directors guilds, if nobody else.) It may be as idealized and romanticized as the usual female one, but still it's a nice change. The other is that the previews do not, as it turns out, contain the only three funny moments in the movie. They contain portions of three funny moments — but, remarkably, there's more to the scenes you've by now surely seen 500 times in previews. In this day and age, leaving some of the funny stuff for the movie seems like an incredibly gallant gesture, and one you have to appreciate. The worst thing to be said about "Hitch" is that the end will come as no surprise to anyone. But it's a happy ending that actually feels like one, so, really, there's no catch.   

Swingers  did it; so did Kissing Jessica Stein  and Sideways . There's a reason, though, that big-budget romantic comedies almost never succeed at nailing the ins and outs of the contemporary dating world. Dating is all about behavior: the fine-tuned verbal and chemical idiosyncrasies that make one person mesh (or not) with another. Most Hollywood love stories are too broad and schematic for that. They're not about personalities. They're about situations.
Take, for instance, Hitch , a movie that pretends to be a wry observational comedy of dating etiquette and mystique. Alex Hitchens (Will Smith) is the legendary, professionally anonymous ''Date Doctor'' of New York City. His nickname is Hitch, which derives, I'd wager, from the fact that he hitches people up. For a fee, he'll consult with any man in love with any woman who, for one reason or another, hasn't given said man the time of day. Hitch comes to the rescue with four-star advice about how to talk, walk, dress, and be. (He should call his business Straight Eye for the Straight Guy.) His theory is that today's women have their guards up so far that a lot of them can't embrace, or even see, the nice dude in front of them. The reality, from what we're shown, is that Hitch is a wizard at hooking up frogs with princesses.
His latest frog is Albert (Kevin James), a meekly earnest and tubby nerd of an accountant who has had the misfortune of falling for one of Manhattan's hottest boldface names: a celebrity rich girl with righteous cheekbones named Allegra Cole (Amber Valletta). You'd assume that this gorgeous specimen of glitterati would be miles out of a guy like Albert's league. But not, it seems, with the right coaching! Kevin James, who's a veteran of sitcoms (The King of Queens , Everybody Loves Raymond ), has a gift for casual slapstick masochism. He knows just how to stumble, how to spill things on himself, how to dance like the world's most grotesque parody of a ''soulful'' lip-biting white man. He's all too convincing as the sort of awkward schmo who would make a champagne socialite like Allegra want to run for the exits. Yet Albert is able to win her over simply by following a few of Hitch's tips and techniques, such as straightening his posture and acting really, really nice to one of her friends. Meanwhile, guys in the audience may think, If only it were that easy. As Albert heads out for the evening, Hitch tells him to imagine himself as an iceberg, with 90 percent of his manly essence submerged beneath the trivial surface of his accountant self. Sounds good, except that a character as superficially conceived as Albert doesn't have a submerged essence. The geek you see is the geek you get.
As Hitch doles out his foolproof bachelor wisdom, he is also acting on it himself, putting the moves on Sara (Eva Mendes), a tabloid gossip columnist who treats romance as a virus against which she'd like to be vaccinated. A dating comedy, like so many actual dates, should be a messy hormonal swirl of ardor and miscommunication. When the two first meet at a bar, Smith and Mendes get a good, fast-talking hostile joust going. But Hitch wins over his object of affection a little too quickly. In Hitch , there's no room for middle ground: The movie splits everything it shows us into a caricature of pathetic loserdom or successful suavity.
Will Smith, taking a break from summer sci-fi smashfests, certainly shows a gift for modulation. Far from coasting, he plays a world expert at romance by ratcheting his charm up and down in supple, exacting degrees. Yet it's part of the Smith package that Hitch remains all but flawless (either that, or he's got cute throwaway flaws, like losing his shirt after catching it in a taxicab door).
Smith and Mendes maintain such a relaxed connection that all there is to keep them apart is her inevitable, horrified discovery that he's the Date Doctor. This mechanical development forces the movie to plod well past the diversion zone. Sara figures that Hitch's smooth moves must have all been...moves. Mere ploys of seduction. What she doesn't quite understand is that he's a tutor in chivalry; he has never taken on a client who is simply trying to get laid. (The one minor character who falls into that category is a loathsome Wall Street jackal.) No one could fairly accuse Hitch, or Hitch , of randiness, coarse insensitivity, and other feministically incorrect sins, but that's really the movie's whole problem: It makes nerds and studs alike so noble that it turns the chase into a neutered game.

s soft and sweet as a marshmallow and about as interesting, "Hitch" is one of those romantic comedies that make the most of New York's recent transformation from a sleazy, hard-edged, interesting city into a mating ground for good-looking loft-dwellers with fascinating jobs. Unlike other examples of the genre, this one was at least filmed almost entirely in the city (mainly in the fancy pseudo-bohemian enclaves of Lower Manhattan, with an excursion to Ellis Island thrown in for good measure), which should gratify residents and tourists tired of the Hollywood habit of commuting, from one scene to the next, between Midtown and Vancouver. In addition to savoring the neighborhood scenery and a few trendy gathering spots that have opened up since "Sex and the City" went off the air, audiences can enjoy the pleasant, easy company of Will Smith and Eva Mendes, two utterly charming screen performers pretending to tremble on the brink of love. Ms. Mendes, whose slightly gap-toothed, dimpled smile will make short work of even those hearts resistant to her other lovely features, plays a newspaper gossip columnist named Sara Melas. As is customary in this kind of picture, Sara is determinedly single, offering a cynical shoulder and moral support to her obligatory insecure friend (Julie Ann Emery), even as Sara's kindly boss (Adam Arkin) worries that his star reporter is working too hard and letting her personal life languish. When she returns early from a vacation with a hot scoop, he pleads with her to take the rest of her allotted time off. This man edits a newspaper called The New York Standard, to which I'll fax my r�sum� as soon as I'm off deadline. Mr. Smith's character is Alex Hitchens, also known as Hitch, who makes a handsome living teaching awkward, nebbishy men how to seduce women who are much better looking than they are. A player-coach in the Manhattan dating game, Alex works behind the scenes to help his hapless clients put their best selves forward, schooling them in the finer points of dress and demeanor. In some ways, he is a discreet, heterosexual version of television's beloved Fab Five, though I guess calling the movie "Black Eye for the White Guy" would not have created quite the impression the filmmakers were aiming for. The potentially sleazy implications of what Alex does are dispensed with quickly. Though he suffered an early heartbreak (related in a flashback that gives Mr. Smith a chance to act goofy as well as effortlessly suave), Alex bears no grudge against women and makes it very clear that his services are not available to cads or users. His own promiscuity is discreetly handled in a single scene (and it's all talk anyway), after which he settles down to the cautious pursuit of the equally cautious Sara. Just to keep things moving along - and to provide the necessary misunderstandings that will temporarily derail the central couple on their way to happiness - there is a parallel plot involving one of Alex's clients, a tubby accountant (Kevin James) with his eye on a willowy heiress (Amber Valletta). Mr. James, best known for the sitcom "The King of Queens," is a fine comic sidekick - a shambling, flailing Jackie Gleason to keep Mr. Smith from getting too relaxed in his Rock Hudson/Dean Martin bachelor vibe. The script, by Kevin Bisch, is rarely laugh-out-loud funny and tactfully avoids anything that might offend the audience by being too clever. The director, Andy Tennant ("Sweet Home Alabama," "Anna and the King"), keeps things moving with perky smoothness. If you've seen "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" or "The Wedding Planner," you pretty much know what you're in for - an average romantic comedy put together with enough professionalism to keep your cynicism momentarily at bay, featuring good-looking actors who also, in this case, seem like pretty nice people. "Hitch" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It treats sex with more gallantry than prurience, and the word most frequently heard on the real streets of Manhattan is uttered exactly once, and with a smile.

Considerably heavier on romance than comedy, "Hitch" stitches together relatively few laughs but generates enough goodwill and energy to keep much of the audience in its corner. Although the script can't sustain the premise -- and saddles the actors with some truly leaden dialogue -- a buoyant second-banana turn by Kevin James and the few chuckle-worthy moments help compensate for the arid stretches. Given the notable dearth of quality fare in this genre, those attributes should strike Sony with Cupid's arrow in the form of reasonably happy date-night returns.
Director Andy Tennant knows about romantic comedies longer on star appeal than smarts, what with "Fools Rush In" and "Sweet Home Alabama" on his resume. "Hitch" plods along on similar terrain, albeit with the additional boon of James' Gleason-esque antics -- a big, round, sweetly spirited lug who is awfully light on his toes.
In the process, "The King of Queens" star somewhat eclipses Will Smith as the smooth-talking "date doctor" -- a near-urban legend, available by referral only, who coaches bumbling guys through the art of romance. The twist, of course, is that Alex "Hitch" Hitchens becomes all thumbs himself once faced with peeling away the hard shell of a comely gossip columnist, Sara (Eva Mendes), who turns his dating maxims upside down.
An opening sequence mixing Smith's voiceover with him directly addressing the camera offers a taste of Hitch's magic, but he takes on an especially challenging project when he tries to help a shy accountant, Albert (James), woo a beautiful jet-setting heiress, Allegra (Amber Valletta).
This isn't to say Hitch lacks a moral code. Indeed, he only opens the door for nice guys lacking the moves to woo a woman, refusing to assist a Wall Street sleaze who has conquest, not romance, in mind. Like Sara, though, he's resistant to love himself, still cautious from a courtship-inflicted wound years before.
It's all rather wispy, and first-time screenwriter Kevin Bisch struggles with the juggling act of keeping the central couple apart and then bringing them back together, aided by the almost-saving grace of having the Albert-Allegra storyline to fall back on.
Beyond his hangdog demeanor, James exhibits a flair for physical comedy, and the scenes of Smith prepping him for dates -- if a little overexposed by the ad campaign -- actually possess considerably more verve than either of the romantic pairings. In the best moment, Albert walks Allegra toward her door bracing for their much-rehearsed first kiss looking much like a guy being marched to a firing squad.
Smith branches out a little here, to the extent that this latest role is devoid of accompanying explosions, while Mendes charms the camera with an ease that exceeds her thinly drawn character. Nor is there much fleshed-out support, with what amount to cameos by Adam Arkin and Michael Rapaport as Sara's tabloid editor and Hitch's married pal, respectively.
As in many a romantic comedy, the juiciest supporting player is Manhattan, a backdrop that goes a long way toward setting the mood, along with George Fenton's score. And while the film drags noticeably during its flabby closing act, the cast provides pleasant enough company to survive the Hallmark-card speeches that run through it.
All told, "Hitch" plays like the oldest of old-fashioned romantic comedies, which would be worth celebrating if only it was slightly better at it. Then again, just as love-seeking bar patrons tend to lower their standards as the clock approaches midnight, in these laugh-challenged times, it'll do.

On the face of it, a high-stakes Hollywood  blockbuster bankrolled by powerful white guys about a young black guy who massages the romantic mojos ofwho else?powerful white guys makes a ripe critical target. Luckily for the PWGs at Columbia, Hitch  mostly sidesteps such high-handed carping with disarming charm, penetrating wit, and a refreshing insouciance about its own potentially problematic contrivances. While far from perfect, Hitch  is a rare studio product that earns the goodwill it smugly demands.
Timed for Valentine's Day (speaking of contrivances), the film is a superficially cynical rom-com with a heart of mush. It centers on the efforts of Manhattan-based "date doctor" Alex Hitchens  (Will Smith ) to bolster the self-esteem and corresponding layability of schlubs like Albert (Kevin James , of TV's The King of Queens  ), an accountant who pines for a fetching heiress (Amber Valletta ). Hitch, natch, is operating from suppressed longings of his own, and, as such movies go, his smooth-operator persona is duly challenged by Sara (Eva Mendes ), a scandal-rag columnist with a Teflon  ticker to match his own.
While much of the movie's appeal hinges on your tolerance for Smith's goofy, self-amused mugging, Hitch  maintains a surprising ensemble feel throughout. Director Andy Tennant  gives the rest of the cast room to relax and show off, and as a result James proves himself an exceptional physical comic. He and Smith are especially good together, and the star (who also co-produced) is generous enough to let himself be upstaged. It helps that Tennant keeps things moving along briskly without ever seeming rushed, and that cinematographer Andrew Dunn  has a keen eye for urban lusterdespite a fondness for working NYC's overexposed architectural tourist trash into his setups.
Of course, Hitch 's central assertion that every player is a damaged romantic doomed to thwart his or her innermost desires until they wilt to nothing is highly debatable (though I'm in no position to make that callI don't even play the lottery), and to say the movie oversimplifies the myriad bewilderments of intimacy is a gross understatement. But it also humanizes characters whose callous machinations would otherwise be repugnant, and their ineptitude at love suggests something fairly daring for a date flickthat as a culture we're perilously close to losing the art of mating. Hitch  also mitigates its questionable psychology by routinely taking the piss out of itself. When Alex escorts Sara to Ellis Island  on a surprise date, for instance, what begins as an eye-rollingly saccharine set piece with bizarre racial overtones ends by hilariously exploding the flag- and dick-waving bathos a dumber movie would've reveled in.
Alas, Hitch  peaks early, and once its good ideas dwindle, all that's left is to wait for the guys to get the girls (or vice versa). This process takes long enough to become a deficit, but even at its most ploddingly plot-dependent the film remains amusingly self-aware: In the protracted denouement, Sara demands of her flummoxed suitor, "Hitchis that a noun or a verb?" It's a labored pun, but better-regarded comedies have made lesser demands of their audiences than to ponder grammatical distinctions.
