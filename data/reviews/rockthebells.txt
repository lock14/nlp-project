 “Rock the Bells” is the story of one man’s labor of love to reunite the original members of the Wu-Tang Clan for a 2004 hip-hop concert in San Bernardino, Calif., and it demands neither familiarity with the music nor a hankering for rhyme. Instead Casey Suchan and Denis Henry Hennelly’s lively documentary grabs hold of the backstage drama and doesn’t let go until the last weary fan has shuffled off home.  The film’s harried hero is Chang Weisberg, an independent-music promoter who refinances his home to realize his dream of a Clan reunion. Against him are an irritable police department, thousands of frustrated fans and his notoriously unreliable headliners. As Mr. Weisberg copes with sound system failures, an overwhelmed security team and performers’ last-minute requests for per diems and “herb,” his mother and aunt wrangle an avalanche of cash in the tiny ticket booth. Meanwhile, Ol’ Dirty Bastard, a founding member of the clan who began life as Russell Jones, is holed up in his hotel room and refusing to perform.  Capturing onstage and off with equal energy — at one point only the inspired freestyling of artists like Redman and MC Supernatural stand between Mr. Weisberg and an all-out riot — “Rock the Bells” is a fascinating glimpse of a dreamer and a music culture that has always depended on dreams.

The last scheduled concert of the original Wu-Tang Clan is the subject of Casey Suchan and Denis Henry Hennelly's lively and amusing docu, "Rock the Bells." A paean to indie ingenuity, pic follows dedicated music promoter Chang Weisberg and his team as they juggle mountains of seemingly unsolvable problems at their 2004 Rock the Bells concert, an all-day affair in San Bernardino, Calif., featuring several cutting-edge artists and scheduled to culminate with the Clan. Between the out-there acts and the never-ending comedy of errors in the wings, docu should rock in limited release, appealing to devotees and the uninitiated alike. 
The largely unflappable Chang, whose less-than-corporate operation includes his pressed-into-service mother, aunt and wife plus one assistant and a lone production manager, must wrestle with apprehensive police, inept security and growing lines of fans waiting hours in the broiling sun.
At several points, Chang is the only thing standing between his event and total chaos, as frustrated ticket-holders rush the gates. In the height of do-it-yourself entrepreneurship, Chang winds up hiding the box office take under layers of towels carried out by his nervous family, heretofore unversed in nonchalantly strolling through angry mobs toting hundred of thousands of dollars (Chang mortgaged his house to finance the concert).
Meanwhile, in the packed, sweltering auditorium, technical problems abound. Sound systems fail and rappers are stranded in the spotlight with no rhythmic backup.
With nine acts booked, the schedule is tight, and one of pic's most hilarious segments features cross-cutting between the production manager trying to hustle off a showboating act and its oblivious, blissed-out DJ, wringing infinite subtle changes on his dying reverb.
Segments by well-known hip-hoppers like Redman and MC Supernatural alternate with more underground cult figures like Sage Francis, Dilated Peoples and Eyedea + Abilities.
But for the faithful in the audience, all this talent merely serves as a prologue to the Wu-Tang, whose stalled appearance threatens to trigger catastrophe. When the Clan fails to materialize, stretching routines to fill the gap becomes the biggest challenge.
Soon the stage is filled with rappers trying to appease the mutinous crowd. Meanwhile, backstage, Chang and Clan founder RZA desperately try to convince Old Dirty Bastard, to go on. ODB's death four months later determined that Rock the Bells would mark the last playdate of the original Clan.

In July 2004, concert promoter Chang Weisberg  organized a hip-hop festival in San Bernardino , California, headlined by the reunited Wu-Tang Clan , the legendary supergroup infamous for its no-shows on tour. The RZA , the GZA , Ol' Dirty Bastard , Inspectah Deck , Raekwon  the Chef, U-God , Ghostface Killah , and Method Man , plus unofficial member Cappadonna : It was a gathering of the gods, nearly as inconceivable as a set by the Beatles , including the dead ones. Corralling every member of this supremely unreliable crew onto the same stage at the same time was challenge enough; nailing down Big Baby Jesus  qualified as a superhuman achievement even before the notoriously unpredictable MC holed up in his hotel room, immobilized on crack.
Whether Ol' Dirty can get his shizat together long enough to rock the mic (or just stand up without help) is the least of Weisberg's problems in Rock the Bells , an electrifying, occasionally terrifying documentary by filmmakers Denis Henry Hennelly  and Casey Suchan . Condensed from 200 hours of fly-on-the-wall footage, it follows the event from (naive) planning to (inadequate) preparation, to (sloppy) execution, to imminent disaster as thousands of frustrated Wu fans threaten to riot. Think Dave Chappelle 's Block Party  booked on United 93 .
Kicking off with a behind-the-scenes glimpse of nuts-and-bolts concert promotion, Rock the Bells  (co-produced by Weisberg) initially appears to be of little interest to anyone but hip-hop nerds seeking dope organizational strategies. Hang the posters like that, yo! On the legal tip, Weisberg dons his best XXXL T-shirt to reassure the authorities that a large gathering of hip-hop fans does not necessarily entail obscene quantities of weed. There's a charming mom-and-pop quality to his company, Guerilla Union , whose staff consists of a feverishly multitasking honey named Carla Garcia  and a bug-eyed stress case named Brian Valdez . They've got passion out the ass, which is super-nice for them, and a lot of phone calls to make, which is rather dull for us. Talking-head interviews with select Wu keep the momentum going, as Rock the Bells  heads toward the big dayand into the pantheon of classic concert docs.
The kids start lining up, the talent starts arriving, and Weisberg starts to get nervous. "It's like we're planning this wedding and you hope the groom shows up." The camera crew jumps into a van to fetch warm-up act Redman  from the airport. "How you 'spect me to do an interview if you don't send no herb?" He ain't playin': Add the hunt for Redman's herb to Weisberg's plate. Meanwhile, some wack white dude called Eyedea "flows" over screeching avant-garde turntablism by DJha!Abilities, and the crowd has massed into the thousands. It soon becomes clear that what little security there is will be woefully inadequate as well as incompetent, but with beaucoup Wu to handle, and the ODB crisis heating up (or rather, passing out cold), Weisberg is overwhelmed. Freestyle genius MC Supernatural takes the stage and earns his name with a jaw-dropping set abetted by his young son Haj. Dilated Peoples  step up only to set aside the mic until the beyond-capacity crowd settles down. Women are fainting at an alarming rate in the front rows. ("Heads by the score take flight incite a war," Deck prophesized on Wu-Tang Forever; "Chicks hit the floor, diehard fans demand more.")
Tension reaches a fever pitch. Security fumbles as the crowd bum-rushes the entrance. Weisberg hustles his motherand his moneyaway from the venue. The signature song of Rock the Bells  might have been the Wu banger "C.R.E.A.M." (Cash Rules Everything Around Me) had the clearance fees come cheaper from the RZA. Immortalizing a great moment in hip-hop history, Hennelly and Suchan also expose its dark side. Ignored in the chaos of the moment, they eavesdrop on the RZA's efforts to lure ODB from his hotel with an extra five grand. "Cause yo, son, this is business right here. This is serious business, know what I mean?"
Pitched on the edge of full-blown riot, Rock the Bells  builds tension in its final half-hour until . . . The outcome of the event is a matter of history, best not spoiled here. Four months after the show, ODB collapsed in the Wu-Tang studios, dead from an accidental overdose of painkillers and cocaine. For all the bullshit and bad behavior on view, this nerve-racking knockout of a film pays testament to the passion of the Tang, and to the memory of the loose-cannon lyricist who never lived to see his lyrics born. "Wu! Is coming through! At a theater near you! And get funk like a shoe! What?"
