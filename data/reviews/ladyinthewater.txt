It's a banner time for cinematic depictions of film critics, those unsung heroes of the war on fun. First Rob Zombie pointedly mocks Gene Shalit � and honestly, what's not to mock? � in last year's perversely glorious hellbilly flashback The Devil's Rejects
, and now M. Night Shyamalan turns a similarly pompous and apparently freeze-dried filmgoer (played to the emotionless anti-hilt by the always excellent actor-writer-director Balaban) into monster chow. Both directors have legitimate bones to pick with their critics, but where the campily gonzo sadism of Zombie's trashy masterpiece was spiteful good fun, Balaban's cinephobic scribbler seems less a fan of the art form than some misguided CPA who got a dose of bad career advice from his high school guidance counselor and has been paying for it, alone in the dark, ever since. You get the feeling this square wouldn't know the value of one of Russ Meyer's ultravixens if she straddled his twig-thin torso and launched fireballs from her nether regions. And that's why it's such a gas watching him attempt to fend off his impending rending with naught but blustery denial. It's one of several outlandishly fine performances in a film top-loaded with honest-to-goodness acting, a prize in genre filmmaking that's roughly as rare as peace in our time. Shyamalan is already taking something of a critical beating on this, his most personal and ambitious film to date, and while Lady in the Water
 manages to be both perplexing and glaringly obvious, it's also a commendable effort to create a modern fairy tale from the seabed up. However you feel about Shyamalan's end result, you can fault neither his ambition nor his peculiar vision, which commingles elements of fantasy, horror, and the real world (itself increasingly fantastical and horrific) to craft a surreal, slightly off-kilter twilight tone that Rod Serling would recognize in a heartbeat. Lady in the Water
, however, is murky where it most requires clarity, and the spindliness of its mythic pilings leaves the whole of the film tilting wildly toward the silly. Giamatti plays Cleveland Heep, the doleful maintenance man at a gray Philadelphia apartment complex christened The Cove. And it is a cove, harboring both secrets of a nearly divine nature and offering up shelter to various storm-tossed lives. When Heep discovers a skinny-dipping nymph named Story (Howard) in his pool one evening, he inadvertently sets in motion an increasingly improbable series of events that bring to bear his own tragic past and rekindle the spark of hope in a whole slew of both metaphysically and metaphorically sleepwalking tenants. Story really is
 a denizen of the deep � a "narf" in the kiddie parlance of the film � and she's come on a mission of mercy to awaken humanity's savior with the unwitting aid of a dozen or so locals who possess magical powers of which they are completely unaware. Moreover, she's being stalked by "scrunts," toothy, lupine predators with a taste for two-legged sashimi. Oh, and there's a giant eagle, too. Giamatti's powerful performance very nearly snatches Lady in the Water
 from the jaws of hokum � performances are bang-on, and characters are fascinating right across the board, even Shyamalan's own � but ultimately Lady in the Water
 capsizes under the weight of its own goofy story. There are moments of great beauty throughout (the film was lensed by Wong Kar-Wai cinematographer Christopher Doyle), and Shyamalan's heart is nowhere if not on his sleeve, but even these moments cannot steer Lady in the Water
 clear of its director's zealously over-earnest pretensions.


A few years ago, the quick, trick ending of M. Night Shyamalan's superhero opus, ``Unbreakable," left me in a state of wild exasperation. (``That was a beginning
!") Then, a good friend offered this consolation: The movie, he said, was like watching someone meticulously snip through a stack of paper. Two hours later, the cutter puts down his scissors and reveals his deceptively ornate creation: a snowflake. My friend had perfectly captured the sense of craftsmanship that can be so captivating, so wondrous, and so infuriating about an M. Night film. On the other hand, a different friend says the director just puts the ``sham" in Shyamalan.
In any case, ``Lady in the Water" is the director's latest and most complicated paper snowflake -- or sham, if you're so inclined. The movie gives us Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), a dolorous, stuttering widower who manages a large courtyard apartment complex somewhere in or near Philadelphia. (The city has never seemed more like Santa Monica, but never mind.)
Cleveland makes his way around the property. He pops in on the multiethnic collection of residents that make the place a virtual international house and gives a tour to his newest tenant, a book and film critic named Farber (like the great critic Manny Farber), whom Bob Balaban plays with humorous humorlessness. One night, Cleveland tumbles into the courtyard's swimming pool and is rescued by the strange young woman (Bryce Dallas Howard) who lives in the waters beneath it. She has perfect skin, even better diction, but terrible bangs. Her name is Story, and, as the namesake implies, she arrives with a tale. But the rules of her world prohibit her from telling it.
Cleveland deduces that his guest is a character in a bedtime story known only by the Korean lady (June Kyoto Lu) who lives with her Americanized daughter (Cindy Cheung) in one of the units. (Shyamalan actually based the film on a tale he invented for his little girls.) Apparently, Story is a ``narf," some kind of lost sea nymph. And it's crucial she get back to her watery home before the killer wolf thing lurking in the woods around the building comes and gets her.
Like Shyamalan's four previous movies -- ``The Sixth Sense," ``Unbreakable," ``Signs," and, especially, ``The Village," this new film is a trip to ``The Twilight Zone." (Giamatti's romantic sadness and simmering temper make him the ideal man for any of the original episodes.) The director's ambition to build suspense through withholding and irony has won him Hitchcock comparisons. His ability to entertain with cinematically robust storytelling is comparable to Spielberg's. And `` Lady in the Water" is sometimes a pleasing amalgam of the adventures in point-of-view from ``Rear Window" and the fantastical homecoming of ``E.T."
Shyamalan's movie is also a cockier and more precious thing. 
It's a fable about fables -- or, more precisely, about how nobody makes good fables anymore. Yet despite how delightful it is watching Giamatti try to bring together the strands of story, Shyamalan's fairy tale doesn't hold up to scrutiny -- at least after a first viewing. (A new book about Shyamalan's making of the movie, ``The Man Who Heard Voices," only helps a little.)
The film's narrative, as it turns out, is beside the point of Shyamalan's other thematic pursuits, one of which happens to be himself. Sure, the superb cast also includes Jeffrey Wright, Jared Harris, Mary Beth Hurt, Freddy Rodriguez, Bill Irwin, and the lovely Sarita Choudhury, but Shyamalan plays the film's heaviest supporting role, a writer who's composed a book that, according to Story, will change the world. She pays him further superlative compliments and tells him of his important destiny. The impulse is to roll your eyes while the filmmaker pats himself on the back.
Nothing Shyamalan has made aspires to world-changing greatness -- or, at least, none of it is world-changing great. But in each of his movies, Shyamalan is trying to wed the horrors of the outside world with those in his insular, hermitically sealed universe. It can be a pretentious and exasperating marriage, since Shyamalan ends his movies the moment reality threatens to invade them. The most amazing example is the sociological prank and suburban-paranoia metaphor that ``The Village" turned out to be.
`` Lady in the Water" doesn't conclude with a trap-door ending, but current events are vaguely all around. For instance, there is war on the television set, and at one crucial point toward the end, the character who spends most of the movie watching it barks at the make-believe absurdity Cleveland has roped him and the other tenants into. He's offended. Understandably so. On some level, what Shyamalan is asking us to do -- to forget the wall-to-wall chaos of our times -- is offensive. Most movies require surrender, but Shyamalan wants us to see `` Lady in the Water" as a sanctuary. It doesn't have that kind of power. It's built on too much ponderous self-regard. And I'm saying this as someone who was tickled by the film's harsh treatment of the starchy movie critic.
Nonetheless, it is possible to wrestle yourself from the movie's hokey ambitions. There is a good chunk of `` Lady in the Water" that is simply too well made and affectingly acted to dismiss as a mere exercise in arrogance. You're tempted to believe in Shyamalan's belief in storytelling, even if you don't believe in Shyamalan himself.

         It's M. Night Shyamalan's world, we only visit it every couple of years. From the gothic haunting of "The Sixth Sense" to the New Age sci-fi of "Unbreakable" and "Signs" and the fable "The Village," the writer-director has created a body of work that has turned him into an above-the-title brand. Those four films have established expectations that he appears to delight in simultaneously embracing and confounding.
 
  More so than the average filmmaker — and he's anything but average — Shyamalan seems to really want you to like his movies. They're deeply personal films that strain to be universal, but the tension between his eagerness to please and his resolve to make the film inside his head have resulted, with "Lady in the Water," in a major misfire. The publicity surrounding his acrimonious split with Disney and his willingness to air the details in a book, threaten to overshadow the film he made.
 


         






    And maybe that's not a bad thing. His seventh feature, "Lady in the Water," is a wan fantasy based on a bedtime story he told his daughters about a sea nymph who needs the help of humans to return to her home in the Blue World. It's a homebrewed mythology that's so generic it borders on being meaningless.
 
  Paul Giamatti plays Cleveland Heep, the depressed, middle-aged super at an apartment complex called the Cove, home to an assortment of misfits and ethnic stereotypes. The five-story, 57-unit building is U-shaped, built around a swimming pool the shape of a lopsided heart. At one end, next to a clearing leading to a forest, is a tiny cottage-like attachment where Cleveland lives in humble simplicity.
 
  Cleveland is a sad figure whose liveliest encounters are with Young-Soon Choi (Cindy Cheung), a pretty college student who complains her studies interfere with her social life, dresses like Britney Spears and brings Cleveland books to read.
 
  We are introduced to the rest of the Cove's residents as Cleveland shows the newest inhabitant, ill-fated, narrow-minded film and book critic Harry Farber (Bob Balaban), to his apartment. As the tenants, a bunch of good actors, including Jeffrey Wright, Bill Irwin, Mary Beth Hurt, Jared Harris and Freddy Rodriguez, are wasted in one-note roles.
 
  Meanwhile, someone has been swimming in the pool after hours, and Cleveland is peeved because it's against the rules and the pool guy is busting his chops over a clogged filter. Hearing splashing one night, he goes to confront the intruder.
 
  The nocturnal swimmer turns out to be Story, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who after starring in "The Village" has become a muse of sorts for the director. Story is a narf, a variety of sea nymph so ethereal and pale as to be nearly translucent, with liquid blue eyes and ringlets of dark red hair. Daryl Hannah's mermaid in "Splash" (coincidentally directed by Howard's father, Ron) is positively earthbound by comparison.
 
  Cleveland rather too quickly buys into Story's improbable yarn about being from the Blue World and needing help to avoid the dangerous scrunt — a creature that looks like a hyena made out of sticks with a back covered by flat, grass-like fur that acts as camouflage — lurking outside. Story is safe in the water but requires the help of humans to be ferried back to her world.
 
  Shyamalan is an intuitive filmmaker, and logic is not always a priority in his storytelling. His characters are much too willing to be pawns in the narrative, lacking the individual motivation to lend the film needed urgency. Audiences, however, have free will and need to be wooed to go along with what seems increasingly silly as the narrative plays out.
 
  It's more of a board game along the lines of "Clue" than an actual movie, with Cleveland trying to put together the various pieces of the puzzle. Following the outline of a bedtime story Young-Soon's Korean mother told her, Cleveland must match the talents of his tenants with archetypal helpers such as a guardian, a symbolist and a healer necessary for Story to return home.
 
  Unfortunately, the viewer will nearly always be far ahead of poor Cleveland and the movie, and apart from a few misdirections there's nothing resembling Shyamalan's trademark twists or jolts.
 
  Still, there is something bizarrely compelling about the movie. It's slower than watching a train wreck but invokes that same level of disbelief. It may be an entirely personal reaction to the material, but I experienced a perverse giddiness as Shyamalan's humor and earnestness engaged in mortal combat for the tone of the film.
 
  His films have always had a bit of dry wit — especially effective in tense moments — but as he has ratcheted up his sincerity in the most recent films, it's reached the point where it's hard to discern the intentional humor from the unintentional.
 
  Remaining in the same neighborhood, both literally — Philadelphia and its surroundings — and figuratively, a self-created genre of soft-sided, uncynical thrillers, Shyamalan has stayed true to his significant fan base. But by making certain choices, he has made a movie that feels too easy to pick on, as if he was setting himself up.
 
  The "Oprah"-ready life lessons that spew from the characters' mouths throughout are the kind of things a more subtle filmmaker would develop as subtext — or leave out entirely. His heavy-handed use of recurrent themes (loss of innocence, faith, secrets) and motifs (water, mirrors, the creature outside) would make an undergraduate lit major in need of a quick term paper salivate, but, as in some of his other films, they tend not to add up to much.
 
  More damaging still is Shyamalan casting himself as one of the apartment building's residents, a young writer with a manifesto called "The Cookbook," which Story tells him — she can see the future — will be of great historic importance. The character's desperate need to be taken seriously drew big-time guffaws at a screening and bears out the reservations expressed by the Disney executives who balked at making the movie.

Few moviegoers had heard of M. Night Shyamalan in 1999 when The Sixth Sense  debuted, a blast of shivery-good cinematic entertainment that dispelled the torpor of the bug-bitten summertime release schedule with its chilled ghost-story foundation and warm psychological decor. But the banality of famelessness ceased to be the filmmaker's problem the minute young Haley Joel Osment began seeing dead people: Suddenly the storyteller was the story, and a corker of a Hollywood success saga at that. A twentysomething writer-director (as well as producer-actor and, these days, father-American Express Card pitchman), Shyamalan instantly established a name for himself as a self-confident filmmaker of high compositional standards, an intriguing young fogy committed to an ancient and ostensibly disappearing old-fogy tradition of ripping yarns. More important, Sixth Sense  was a hit, a crowd-pleaser: This starry Night showed himself to be an aesthetic perfectionist with a golden commercial touch.
With Unbreakable  (2000), Signs  (2002), and The Village  (2004), Shyamalan continued to plow his field of dreams, a place where specially gifted Shyamalan kind of men (Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix) sort out the real, true, and important from the hoo-ha everyone else is feeding them  especially since the real, true, and important is often of a spiritual and/or supernatural nature. To mash myths only slightly, a Shyamalan man is a wizard trapped in a world of Muggles. As, it seems, the filmmaker himself has come to believe is his fate.
Muggledom runs amok in Lady in the Water , Shyamalan's most alienating and self-absorbed project to date. His most fanciful, too, since the narrative springs from a fairy tale the director made up for his two daughters: A nymphlike creature named Story (The Village 's Bryce Dallas Howard, her waifishness perhaps borrowed from old photos of Mia Farrow in bangs), who's actually a magical narf from the Blue World, gets stranded among the non-narf residents of a depressed, earthbound apartment complex suitable for recycling in a droll Jim Jarmusch pastiche. The place is haphazardly managed by a stuttering drabster named Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), and clearly something about the name heeped on his character (in a movie riddled with eccentric monikers) has undone Giamatti, who doesn't stand a chance at making the guy relatable, even as a schlub.
Story needs to get back to where she once belonged, but she's thwarted by an unpleasant, wiry, drooling creature called a scrunt, and it's up to Cleveland to rally the rest of the circus-tent tenants (among them Cindy Cheung as a hard-edged, go-getter Korean college student, Jeffrey Wright as a quiet crossword-puzzle fanatic, Bill Irwin as a dour, housebound TV watcher, and Shyamalan as a sensitive writer whose work, Story prophesies, will profoundly affect future generations) to help Dorothy get back to Kansas. I mean to help E.T. get back to the spaceship. I mean to help Story get back to the Blue World, and in so doing, discover the bit of spiritual blue that exists within each of us if only we believe in Tinker Bell, ecology, Jungian archetypes, and the possibility of being touched by an angel.
Except, of course, for the one who is untouchable. It is the movie's proudest and biggest fart joke that the building's newest resident is a ''books and movie critic'' named Mr. Farber, a pinched sourball played by Bob Balaban with the same impressive enemy-of-creativity dyspepsia he brought to the role of network executive on Seinfeld . Nothing charms, impresses, delights, amuses, or moves Mr. Farber (the name echoes that of the great critic Manny Farber  and, for that matter, movie journalist Stephen Farber).He doesn't believe in narfs, movie magic, or communal tenant activity. And in the end, it gives away nothing to reveal that the killjoy is dispatched by the scrunt with nary a grunt.
But while the subplot is an up-yours to actual critics and a wink-wink to civilians (who are likely to be busy enough keeping up with the nomenclature), the rise and fall of Mr. Farber results in something far punier: The amount of story time devoted to such an inconsequential naysayer emphasizes the movie's very smallness, its unease as a cohesive piece, and the inner creative discontent at its core. Why a filmmaker so gifted with talent as well as so fortunate in his success should scrunt and scratch his private itches in public  in front of the very audience that has lauded him  is a mystery too deep for this Muggle. Was the reception of his last film not quite as Blue Worldly as he wished it to be? I guess it takes a Village  to raise a narf.

 IT was just around the time when the giant eagle swooped out of the greater Philadelphia night to rescue a creature called a narf, shivering and nearly naked next to a swimming pool shaped like a collapsed heart, that I realized M. Night Shyamalan had lost his creative marbles. Since Mr. Shyamalan’s marbles are bigger than those of most people, or so it would seem from the evidence of a new book titled “The Man Who Heard Voices” (and how!), this loss might have been a calamity, save for the fact that “Lady in the Water” is one of the more watchable films of the summer. A folly, true, but watchable.  A bedtime story that plays like a stab at a modern myth, “Lady in the Water” follows Mr. Shyamalan’s sensationally entertaining breakout (“The Sixth Sense”), a pair of misfires (“Unbreakable” and “Signs”) and a raging bore (“The Village”). As before, this film involves characters who, when faced with the inexplicable, behave less like real people than idealized movie audiences: they believe.  Mr. Shyamalan is big on faith. He wants us to believe. In him. In film. In his films. To be swept away by that transporting swell of feeling that comes with love, sex, gods, the great outdoors and sometimes, though not often enough, the movies. Mr. Shyamalan wants to carry us away. He wants to be Steven Spielberg.  Of course even Mr. Spielberg is not Mr. Spielberg anymore (see “Munich”), meaning the former boy wonder of Hollywood is no longer content to tuck us into the basket on Elliott’s bicycle in “E.T.” and pedal off to Neverland. Even when he is gleefully blowing the planet to smithereens, as he does in “War of the Worlds,” Mr. Spielberg takes on the important issues now, leaving the easy kids’ stuff to manqués like Mr. Shyamalan. This can happen when someone matures, or at least goes gray. Though in Hollywood — which is something of an enormous incubator, where embryonic personalities curl up in their own goo, kind of like Neo before he unplugs from the Matrix — growing up is sometimes awfully hard to do.  That’s too bad, because Mr. Shyamalan has a nice way with actors, a fine eye and an actual vision of the world (scary but hopeful). Like Jerry Bruckheimer, he also knows how to buy great screen talent, no doubt at bargain rates. For this new film, he has tapped the excellent Paul Giamatti, who plays Mr. Shyamalan’s hero, a building manager with the torturous name of Cleveland Heep, and, in smaller roles, the fine character actors Jared Harris and Jeffrey Wright. Also along for the strange ride are other familiar indie-film types like Bob Balaban, Sarita Choudhury and Bill Irwin — who, having recently gone up against Martha on Broadway in “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?,” seems content to sit in the dark here doing precious little.  Mr. Irwin won’t be the only one in the dark, storywise and otherwise. For all its exposition — and, as a screenwriter, Mr. Shyamalan is certainly one Chatty Cathy — this film could have easily been called “Lady in the Dark.” It’s obscure in more ways than one. Shot by the cinematographer Christopher Doyle, best known for his superb work for Wong Kar-wai, “Lady in the Water” appears to have been lighted with a book of matches and a dying flashlight. The murky results are generally unlovely if occasionally striking, though, like Mr. Shyamalan’s decision to have most of the actors deliver most of their lines in a hush, as if they were courtiers tendering precious gifts, the low illumination does help create an air of claustrophobic intimacy.  Mr. Shyamalan has said “Lady in the Water” began as a bedtime story he told his daughters, to whom he has dedicated the film. There are all kinds of bedtime stories, those that lull you to sleep and those that keep you anxiously perched at the edge of the bed. This film, which involves Cleveland’s  attempt to save a water nymph, or what Mr. Shyamalan distractingly calls a narf (Bryce Dallas Howard), has the baggy, meandering structure of a parental yarn invented on the fly. And because Mr. Shyamalan works hard to be original, the story zigs and zags into unexpected corners, like the apartment where five of Cleveland’s neighbors sit rapping in a cloud of smoke, or under the pool, where a secret world lies in wait.  There are moments of charm in “Lady in the Water,” along with funny bits, some intentional, others not, and a satisfyingly big “boo!” It’s always pleasant to spend time with Mr. Giamatti, who does most of the heavy lifting as a battered soul in need of healing, though Cleveland’s haunted eyes suggest it isn’t emotional succor he’s desperately in need of.  Unfortunately, while Ms. Howard’s character, the regrettably  named Story, spends a lot of the film wet, she’s one of those juiceless virginal fantasies who inspire pure thoughts, noble deeds and stifled yawns. Disney’s Little Mermaid comes off like a tramp by comparison, which suggests that Mr. Shyamalan needs to add a fairy-tale revisionist like Angela Carter to his bedtime reading.  That seems unlikely, since he appears insistent on clinging to myths, particularly about innocence and faith, that serve the myth of his own genius. In “Lady in the Water,” an unseen narrator (David Ogden Stiers)  explains that while man once listened to “those in the water,” he no longer does, which is why we have gone to hell in a handbasket or words to that effect. Apparently those who live in the water now roam the earth trying to make us listen, though initially it’s rather foggy as to what precisely we are supposed to hear — the crash of the waves, the songs of the sirens, the voice of God — until we realize that of course we’re meant to cup our ear to an even higher power: Mr. Shyamalan.  That doesn’t make him any different from any other bubble boy with a fat paycheck and the slavish attention of a media that mocks his narcissism by publishing articles about his narcissism. Before movies could talk, the great director Erich von Stroheim stuck a von in his name and a monocle over an eye and strutted around Hollywood until the producer Irving Thalberg slapped him down to size. (Guess who Hollywood named an Academy Award for?) In “You’ll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again,” Julia Phillips writes that Martin Scorsese greeted a news report about Sara Jane Moore’s attempt on Gerald Ford’s life with the line “You think this’ll hurt the picture?”  He was worried about “Taxi Driver.” It didn’t hurt, thank goodness.  Mr. Shyamalan isn’t an artist on the level of Mr. Scorsese; he’s just another film director who, having made a lot of money for a lot of people, was crowned an auteur at an age when he should have been deemed promising. The curse of the auteur fells a lot of filmmakers, in and out of the studio system. And paradoxically, the weakest link in Mr. Shyamalan’s new film is its story, which is filled with strenuously overworked bits and locutions like scrunt (kind of like a devil dog) and the tartutic (monkeylike creatures that descend from the trees). Mr. Shyamalan has yet to realize that one Giamatti in the hand is worth two scrunts in the bush, but maybe one day, after he’s recovered all those  misplaced marbles, he will.  “Lady in the Water” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The violence is bloodless and rarely intense.

Vindication is rarely as swift or complete as that likely awaiting the Disney execs who passed on M. Night Shyamalan's latest effort "Lady in the Water." After Disney balked, the director carted the project to Burbank neighbor Warner Bros., then lambasted his former studio for a lack of vision in a tie-in, tell-some book. Disney's misgivings were well founded, as Shyamalan has followed "The Village" with another disappointment -- a ponderous, self-indulgent bedtime tale. Awkwardly positioned, this gloomy gothic fantasy falls well short of horror, leaving grim theatrical prospects beyond whatever curiosity the filmmaker's reputation and the mini-controversy can scare up.
Although Shyamalan indicates in the storybook-style animated opening sequence that the story is derived from ancient myth, his perplexing creation stimulates a nagging sense that he's simply making it up as he goes along. (This is apparently the case, as the production notes say the idea "began as an impromptu bedtime story for his two young daughters.")
Among their complaints, Disney execs reportedly warned Shyamalan about presenting a clueless film critic as a supporting player, though compared with the pic's other transgressions, that one is harmless. The character appears designed to exact a measure of revenge against those who slighted "The Village" and to inoculate "Lady in the Water" against whatever barbs are hurled its way.
That rather gratuitous plot point, however, coupled with the writer-director-producer's expansion of his traditional Hitchcockian cameos into a pivotal role, does flavor the film with a distracting hint of self-absorption.
If Shyamalan's earlier works hinged on a clever twist or big surprise (think "The Sixth Sense" and "Unbreakable," and, less successfully, "The Village"), "Lady" telegraphs its intentions from the outset.
The lady in question, Story ("Village" star Bryce Dallas Howard), is a "Narf" -- a sea nymph from The Blue World who has taken up residence in the swimming pool of the Cove apartments, which no one will confuse with "Melrose Place."
The complex is home to an eclectic group of misfits, beginning with Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti), its emotionally wounded superintendent, who discovers Story and takes it upon himself to help the naked nymph fulfill her mission and return home, a task that will require the aid of various tenants. Throughout, she's in danger of attack by another Blue World visitor, the Scrunt, a werewolf-like creature that bears a passing resemblance to the "beasts" in "The Village."
Story is alternately fearful and full of other-worldly serenity, forcing Cleveland to elicit clues regarding the myth and how best to assist her from Young-Soon (Cindy Cheung), whose Korean-speaking mother is well versed in Narf lore. Others helping decipher the scheme include the aforementioned critic (Bob Balaban); a would-be writer (Shyamalan) and his sister (Sarita Choudhury); and a wordsmith (Jeffrey Wright) who excels at crossword puzzles.
Shyamalan's script is its own kind of puzzle, albeit one that never connects and generally handcuffs the large cast. Giamatti is appropriately schlubby and dour as the Everyman thrust into the organizing role, while Howard can never get much beyond a vacant, beatific stare. Only Cheung brings much vitality to the proceedings, and that's by jabbering away in fast-talking Pidgin English that's mostly silly but to some might border on offensive.
Nor does it help that Balaban's arrogant critic keeps discussing movie conventions and cliches in a film that builds toward an unsatisfying and abrupt climax. Reminding the audience where movies fall flat hardly seems advisable.
Tech credits similarly fail to impress, including the fleetingly glimpsed creature effects, which, given the marginal level of suspense, hardly seem to justify a PG-13 rating.
What's most acutely lacking, though, is magic equal to the movie's fairy-tale underpinnings -- starting with the enticing, childlike notion of something mysterious living in the swimming pool. Establishing a sense of fantasy, beyond James Newton Howard's hard-working score, might help people accept that a sort-of mermaid has moved in next door.
Instead, much of the action is confined to Story taking refuge in Cleveland's depressing flat, and the narrative proves a bit too intense for younger tykes yet neither exciting nor engaging enough to galvanize adults.
By publicly harpooning Disney, Shyamalan has rendered a kind of service -- illustrating how filmmakers can lose perspective on passion projects. Whatever the rationale behind the criticism, however, after using "Lady in the Water" to tuck in the kids, it should have been tucked away.

It would be a mighty sweet thing to see M. Night Shyamalan  as the great redemptive storyteller he clearly thinks he isor as he portrays himself in those American Express  commercials. Genuine yarn-spinning, even as a doomed ambition, is virtually extinct in American movies; what was the system's priority in the studio years became, gradually, a neglected excuse for raw effect and A.D.D. image-making. In a way Shyamalan yearns to be modern movies' W. Somerset Maugham  or even Stephen King , a compulsive story-lover dismissive of both postmodernism and technology, and what he promises is gobbled up, I think, because there is such a drought of narrative thinking in the 'plexes. Shyamalan's movies are at least attempts at making the tale an emotional experience, not the noise, the effects, the music, the violence, the Avid-spasm editing.
Shyamalan certainly uses all of that and more in his constructions; it's the stories that are the problem. That is to say, nothing will prepare younot his previous films, not any reviews you may read, not even a lifetime spent watching Pokémon   and Yu-Gi-Oh!   cartoonsfor the rampant foolishness of Lady in the Water . The Village , his last, distended elegy for Rod Serling , is, well, Rod Serling by comparison. It's as if on some semiconscious level, Shyamalan, who I do not doubt is a serious and self-serious pop-creative original, is calling his own success into question and daring his audience to gulp down larger and spikier clusters of manure, just to see if they will. Or he's lost his mind.
I'm not sure I can get my critical jaws around this muffin, description-wise, and I'm sure it cannot be done without some spoilage. But: After a cave-drawing animation detailing some fairy-tale background, we're plopped down into a very odd (meant to be quaint) apartment complex in the Philadelphia suburbs, occupied mostly by stereotype eccentrics (meant to be cute, but often creepy): a bodybuilder who has bulked up only one half of his body (Freddy Rodriguez ), a glowering shut-in (Bill Irwin ), grown brother and sister roommates (Shyamalan and Sarita Choudhury ), a cabal of inveterate potheads (the dialogue for which suggests that Shyamalan has never, ever been stoned), etc. Our sensibly named hero, superintendent Cleveland Heep (Paul Giamatti ), is a lonesome, bighearted lug. We don't so much as see the parking lot, only the overgrown woods beyond the swimming pool. Soon, a water-logged nymph (Bryce Dallas Howard ) saves Heep after he falls in the pool; awakening in his flat, he's told by this ethereal gamine (Howard can act, but here she just stares) that she's a "narf," which is a brand-new faerie moniker Shyamalan, hilariously, attributes to ancient "Asian" folklore.
A narf, you see, has to be seen by a chosen human every now and then, so that human will be inspired to greatness, before the "scrunts"large, grass-backed hyenaskill her, but they can be held off by whoever's designated, somehow, as "the Guardian," with whose help (and that of a "Symbolist," a "Guild," and a "Healer") she can be hauled away by the "Great Eatlon"a giant eagleunless of course the "Tartutic" intervenes . . .
Holy free association, Batman. You'd think Shyamalan made this malarkey up in the editing room, but it has also manifested as a children's book (just published by Little, Brown), and its aboriginal, 150-word form makes just as little sense. What makes Lady in the Water  a uniquely stultifying experience is how this bizarre concoction is explicated. Giamatti's schmo spends the bulk of the film piecing the legend together from hearsay, whim, the dribs of bedtime memory provided by a recalcitrant Korean woman, and, to the delight at least of drop-jawed critics, the knee-jerk cliché-knowledge of a new tenant (Bob Balaban ), who happens to be a film critic. (In one sweep, Shyamalan conforms his movie to critics' worst expectations, tells the critics they're wrong, and then imagines their execution.) Every fresh detail, rule, or exception is cause for exasperation, and the willful ignorance of real mythology, outpacing that of most high-schoolers, is significant. What scrunt  musters up when Googled is proof as well that Shyamalan don't surf. The film often has the driving tension of a paranoid psychotic, desperately trying to figure out the absolutely nonsensical.
This isn't magical realism, it's pure magical thinkingShyamalan is mystically assuming that any idea or image that pops into his skull will make a shapely tale, no matter how much cock-and-bull logic he has to invent to Gorilla Glue it together. Like all his movies from The Sixth Sense on, Lady  pivots on the dawning awareness of a vast cosmic plan, foisted on grieving parents and spouses as a holy scab for their wounds. It's beginning to chafe as a formula; I suspect Shyamalan's stock is long worthless among viewers who know about loss for real. Authorial vision is a non-issue, in the face of so much repetitive, rootless mumbo jumbo.
