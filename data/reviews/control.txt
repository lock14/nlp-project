When Ian Curtis, the lead singer of Joy Division, hung himself in 1980, at 23, the doomy mystery of his suicide cast its shadow backward over the mythology of the band. It sealed their status as generationally morose punk prophets. The provocation of Control , the haunting Curtis biopic directed by Anton Corbijn, is that in shining a light on what really happened to Curtis, it undoes his image as the hip depressive bard of the Manchester music scene.
Sam Riley, who plays Curtis, looks eerily like him, with that dashing yet slightly androidal bug-eyed handsomeness. He's mesmerizing in the concert scenes, where he and the other actors perform live, duplicating the surging hypno drone that made Joy Division sound like something out of a bombed-out East Berlin disco. Riley flings his arms around in Curtis' spasmodic martial strut, which was like a robot parody of one of his epileptic fits (a condition he addressed in ''She's Lost Control,'' arguably Joy Division's greatest song). He also sounds exactly like Curtis  that is, like a Jim Morrison who had already seen The End.
Working in lustrous wide-screen black and white, Corbijn juxtaposes the godless glory of Joy Division's music with a hero whose ironic fate is that he never lost his innocence. A sweet, moody kid who grows up addicted to Iggy, Bowie, and Roxy Music, Curtis dives into marriage, then parenthood, with his doting sweetheart (Samantha Morton), and even once the band hits, he toils away at an employment office, trying to be a good family man. But the temptations of rock stardom render his domestic life claustrophobically drab. (The drugs he's forced to take for his epilepsy bedevil him even further.) Once he falls into an on-the-road affair with Belgian journalist Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara), he's split like Hamlet between his two lives. What the film never quite answers is: Why doesn't Curtis simply abandon his marriage, like a thousand celebrities  and confused young men  before him? Instead, poisoned by guilt, he martyrs himself to the '' normal'' existence he can't live up to. I'm not sure if I believe that's all there was to Curtis' tragedy, but Control  goes past the clichés of punk rock-god gloom to offer a snapshot of alienation that's shockingly humane.

 In 1973, when we first encounter him, Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) is a lanky schoolboy in Macclesfield, a red-brick English town outside of Manchester, with intense but not unusual interests. Apart from cigarettes and his best friend’s girlfriend (whom he will shortly marry), these are mainly musical and literary. In his debut film, “Control,” about the last seven years of Mr. Curtis’s life, Anton Corbijn notes some of the figures in the young man’s personal canon — the expected proto-punk culture heroes (David Bowie, Lou Reed, J. G. Ballard), yes, but also William Wordsworth, whose “Ode: Intimations of Immortality”  Mr. Curtis quotes from memory.  Of course, from its very first frame, “Control” is shadowed by intimations of its main character’s imminent mortality. Mr. Curtis, the lead singer in Joy Division, the great post-punk Manchester quartet, committed suicide in 1980, just before the band was to embark on its first American tour. He was 23, and in the years since his death he has become a canonical figure in his own right. Even as Joy Division’s austere, brooding songs — “Love Will Tear Us Apart,” “Isolation,” “She’s Lost Control” — have continued to influence musicians from all corners of the musical cosmos, they have lost very little of their glum, haunting power.  The challenge facing Matt Greenhalgh, the screenwriter, and Mr. Corbijn, a celebrity photographer who took pictures of the real Joy Division a few months before Mr. Curtis died, is how to tell this story of great promise and early death without turning it into yet another exercise in pop martyrology. How, in other words, to take account of Mr. Curtis’s artistic life and its premature end without treating them as simple cause and effect. The worst and most common failing in movies of this kind — biographies of artists, musicians in particular — is that they turn creativity into a symptom and fate into pathology. One of the great virtues of “Control”  is that it does not fall into this trap. Where it might have been literal-minded and sentimental, it is instead enigmatic and moving, much in the manner of Joy Division’s best songs.  You hear a lot of these on the soundtrack, flawlessly performed by Mr. Riley and the other members of the cast (Joe Anderson on bass, James Anthony Pearson on guitar and Harry Treadaway as the wisecracking drummer) who turned themselves into an uncannily persuasive tribute band. (Just how good they are may not become fully apparent until you hear the real Joy Division’s version of “Atmosphere” over the end credits.)  Joy Division’s two albums were artifacts of their time that became permanent fixtures in the pop universe, available to any listener with a good reason to want a few minutes of voluptuous bad feeling. In tracing them back to their origins, Mr. Corbijn resists the temptation to pile on the evocative period details or to wallow in nostalgia for the early days of the Manchester scene. Shot in a pale, Nouvelle Vague black-and-white palette, “Control” manages to be both stylized and straightforward, avoiding overstatement even as it generates considerable intensity.  Mr. Riley, hollow-eyed and gentle-looking, is crucial to the film’s effectiveness. Since Mr. Curtis is known more by his deep, plangent voice than by his face or his physical presence, Mr. Riley does not labor under the burden of mimicry, like the recent portrayers of more famous singers like Ray Charles or Johnny Cash. His performance is quiet, charismatic and a little opaque, in keeping with the movie’s careful, detached approach to its subject.  Samantha Morton, playing Mr. Curtis’s wife, Deborah (on whose 1995 memoir, “Touching From a  Distance,” the film is based), provides a necessary measure of hurt and warmth, reminding the audience that Ian Curtis’s great subject as a writer was heartbreak.  But Mr. Corbijn and Mr. Greenhalgh, to their credit, do not presume to probe the depths of Mr. Curtis’s psychology, or to find the hidden emotional sources of his songs. Instead their film shows, plainly and sufficiently, how those songs were made. They were written down in a notebook, practiced with the rest of the band and then performed in front of ever larger and more ecstatic audiences.  But the group’s progress — it wins the favor of the Manchester music guru Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson) and acquires  an aggressive manager in the person of Rob Gretton (Toby Kebbell) — is accompanied by increasing complication and strain in Mr. Curtis’s personal life. While still a teenager, he marries Deborah and becomes a father just as Joy Division is recording its first album. He begins to suffer from epileptic seizures  and to worry that the medicine he takes to treat the condition will affect his moods and his mind. He also falls for a Belgian journalist named Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara), and love tears him apart, again.  “Control”  tells a sad story that is also a chronicle of success, and it declines to find an easy moral either in Joy Division’s rapid rise or in its lead singer’s early death. These are things that happened, both on the intimate stage of individual life and in the larger arena of popular culture. Mr. Corbijn, no doubt aware of what this movie will mean to devotees of post-punk melancholy, sticks to the human dimensions of the narrative rather than turning out yet another show business fable. You don’t have to know anything about Joy Division to grasp the mysterious sorrow at its heart.  “Control” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes obscenities and drug use.
Control , indeed. Put damage  in front of it and you get a concise description of the casual conspiracy of silence that enveloped Ian Curtis 's bandmates, friends, and lovers after his suicide in 1980. Anyone who cares to already knows the ambitious and deeply troubled Curtis fronted Joy Division the seminal post-punk band from gloomy Manchester  that released a few classic singles, two still-astounding studio albums, and a compilation before transforming themselves (after Curtis's death, at age 23) into the million-selling New Order . Wisely, or perhaps through simple naïveté, Curtis's surviving protégés kept the aura of mysterious impersonality surrounding their lives and work largely intact until his widow, Deborah Curtis , published Touching from a Distance  in 1996. A deceptively offhand memoir of her torturous life with Curtis, it revealed the previously suppressed details of the singer's drug problems, his debilitating epilepsy, his philandering, and his very uneasy relationship with the fame he craved. It also gave fans a glimpse of the wry humor that was so much a part of Curtis's conflicted psychesurely something that helped to mitigate the pall that his mask of self-absorption and fatalistic gloom cast over the rest of his short life, and that helps to explain why Debbie stayed with such a miserable excuse for a husband for as long as she did.
But this humanizing element is almost entirely absent from Anton Corbijn 's bland Curtis memorial. Corbijn is an influential photographer, with iconic shots of Joy Division, U2 , Johnny Cash , R.E.M. , and many others in his well-traveled portfolio; more recently, he's directed idiosyncratic videos for Depeche Mode  and Nirvana . His long infatuation with Joy Division first went public when his photos of the bandmade literally in Curtis's final weekswere shunned by the press as too strange, too arty; only after the singer's death did these enigmatic images become widely known, making Corbijn famous in the process. Inevitably, then, Corbijn became the de facto image consultant to the burgeoning postmortem JD industry: Witness his risible late-'80s video for "Atmosphere," in which dwarfish, robed, and hooded figures galumph through an arid sub-Bergmanesque landscape, intercut with stills of the young, then-clueless band. Corbijn's later videos are often much less cack-handed than this one, making him an obvious (perhaps too obvious) choice for his much-postponed feature-length debut.
Questions of objectivity aside, Control  is very beautiful in its re-creation of late-'70s working-class Manchester; cinematographer Martin Ruhe  captures in pristine black-and-white the oppressive, post-industrial weight of a dying city in poignant vignettes of the cheerless council houses, generic offices, and seedy clubs that Curtis and his bandmates haunted. Despite these beautifully staged tableauxwhich for viewers knowledgeable in the band's history merely serve as pleasant diversions between the over-obvious musical cues ("Love Will Tear Us Apart" wells up just after Curtis's first dalliance with "other woman" Annick Honoré ) and the major biographical set pieces (the embryonic band's fabled first meeting, various seizures, the Derby Hall riot)almost nothing happens. And it doesn't  happen at a glacial pace, and in a stultifyingly linear fashion.
As with any biopic of this sort, the audience knows the story (and the score) so well that the only way to make a dramatization of it meaningful or relevant is to consciously contribute to its mythology as Michael Winterbottom 's wondrous 24 Hour Party People  did to the Tony Wilson /Factory legend, or Warner Brothers' 1946 Night and Day  picture did for Cole Porter , or Gus Van Sant 's Last Days  did for Saint Kurt. With Control , Corbijn swaps true pathos for mere visual minutiae and emotional shorthand. Despite excellent performances from Samantha Morton , Craig Parkinson , and the radiant Toby Kebbell ,  along with a noble effort from pretty newcomer Sam Riley as Curtis himself, Control  is like a wake where the guests forgot to bring the booze and, for the most part, have nothing very nice or even particularly interesting to say about the deceased. Curtis was young, fucked-up, given to petty cruelties, andby his own estimationdoomed. After seeing this banal flick, who cares?
