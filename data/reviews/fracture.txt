Anthony Hopkins can convey more with one flared nostril than most actors can express with their entire bodies working in overdrive. To remark that he is one of the best in the business is to state the obvious. As Fracture
�s wife-murdering protagonist, Ted Crawford, Hopkins is a delight to watch as he uses his actorly guiles to successfully agitate, torment, and belittle his accusers, who are unable to find the evidence to prove his guilt despite full certainty that he committed the act. Gosling is also one of the best young actors of his generation, having parlayed his entry into the business as a Mickey Mouse Club
 member into award-winning roles in The Believer
 and The Notebook
 and an Academy Award nomination for his turn last year in Half Nelson
. Cast in Fracture
 as the hotshot assistant DA (with a 97% conviction record) whose task it is to convict Crawford, Gosling, too, is a pleasure to watch. This legal thriller pits these two brilliant actors against each other in a sustained battle of wills that has enough sizzle to keep us rapt even when the storyline sags and zags. Veteran courtroom dramatist Hoblit (who made his bones with the TV series Hill Street Blues
, L.A. Law
, and NYPD Blue
 before making his film directing debut 10 years ago with the legal thriller Primal Fear
) directs with seamless style despite the movie�s overstuffed narrative midsection and warrantless romantic subplot. The script by Daniel Pyne (a Miami Vice
 TV vet before penning Any Given Sunday
 and The Manchurian Candidate
) and Glenn Gers would probably have benefited from the excision of some of the film�s unnecessary bits of business. More important is that Crawford�s machinations don�t hold up under close scrutiny, dependent as they are on advance calculations based on the presumed future reactions of various characters. However, even though essential ingredients of the movie don�t hold up in the light of day, in the dark of the theatre Fracture
 keeps it together � mainly through the sheer will of Hopkins and Gosling.


A movie about shamelessness should be shameless itself. And for five minutes here and there, Fracture does a passable job. In fact, Anthony Hopkins, who plays a genius structural engineer who shoots his wife and then represents himself at the trial, has rarely demonstrated less shame than he does in this preposterous courtroom thriller. Nor has Ryan Gosling. Although at about a third of Hopkinss age, he has decades to top his oily performance as opposing counsel.
The film is neither a whodunit nor a whydunit. We know both. Hopkinss character, Ted Crawford, pulls the trigger because his wife (Embeth Davidtz) has been having an affair. Not long after the shooting, a detective (Billy Burke) arrives at the Crawfords great big Southern California home, and to his shock discovers that the woman on the floor is the very one hed been seeing. Ted goes to jail, willingly confesses, and relishes the fact that Goslings district attorney, Willy Beachum (what a name), will try to put him away.
Willy is the movies favorite kind of lawyer: hotshot. This one is about to move on to bigger things  a fancy new job at a corporate firm, where he can work alongside the icy dame (Rosamund Pike) who recruited and bedded him. But his 97 percent conviction rate and Teds obvious gamesmanship (that the wifes lover took Teds confession nullifies Willys entire case) compel him to find a new angle to prosecute. Ted chooses to be his own defense attorney, claiming he knows nothing about the law. But hes obviously better at it than Willy. Fiona Shaw plays the presiding judge, and she looks rightly confused and exasperated.
The movie seems so content to be smarter than youre expecting that it never amounts to more than a talky tease. Whats breezy about the first half of the picture turns logy in the second. The entire film is hung on a shrugging legal plot twist that, years ago, managed to inspire a whole Ashley Judd vehicle. And since Hopkins is far too likable as a would-be cold-blooded murderer (whose wife, mind you, remains in a coma) the movie has to settle for a humane ending that also feels like a shrug.
Fracture was written by Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers and directed by Gregory Hoblit, whose last legal thriller, Primal Fear, was more enjoyably hokey. The new movie isnt stupid, however. The screenplay has its share of fun, snappy dialogue, and theres no shortage of good actors to deliver it, from Shaw and Pike, to David Strathairn, as Willys boss, Cliff Curtis, as a detective, and Bob Gunton, as Pikes father.
Then theres Gosling and Sir Anthony slinging ham at each other. They spend their scenes crossing accents. Goslings has a backwoods lilt that evokes possums, beer cozies, and spritzes of cheap cologne. Hopkins might be using his native Welsh brogue. Who can say, since to me he doesnt ever sound the same way twice?
In any case, you neednt actually see Fracture to know that if the charge is acting that winks, these two are guilty.


         "Fracture" is the kind of movie that can get you really worked up if you take it too seriously and try to parse all the twists. Rather, the best way to enjoy it is to suspend your disbelief and soak up the actorly tête-à-tête that pits wily veteran Anthony Hopkins against young gun Ryan Gosling in the kind of courtroom potboiler that can be fun if you let it.
 
 Hopkins plays Ted Crawford, a brilliant aeronautical engineer who specializes in finding the fatal flaws in plane malfunctions and crashes. It's the type of charming villain role he's done a number of times but perfectly suits his crinkly eyed smirk.
 


         






   Ted discovers that his beautiful young wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz), is having an affair, spies on the lovers at a hotel, then waits for her at home, where he cold-bloodedly shoots her in the face.
 
 Completely unflustered, Ted meticulously cleans himself up and waits for the police to arrive, then hands over a crucial piece of evidence before making his confession. An open-and-shut case for hotshot prosecutor Willy Beachum (Gosling). Or is it?
 
 Willy is the kind of rising star who's in such a hurry to get to the top that he brushes his teeth in the shower and checks his ethics when they become inconvenient. He's got one foot out the door of the L.A. County District Attorney's Office on his way to a lucrative job in the corporate sector and is in that position where one sometimes makes a mistake that otherwise might be avoided.
 
 The film is sleekly directed by Gregory Hoblit ("Primal Fear"), giving downtown L.A. some nice aerial advertising for loft-living and a glossy presentation of Bunker Hill courtesy of director of photography Kramer Morgenthau, production designer Paul Eads and their crews. Written by Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers from a story by Pyne, the script is as fine tuned as one of the brass sculptures that Ted fancies featuring balls rolling on intricate tracks, as long as it keeps to its main plot. It's packed with a surprising amount of humor, especially in a goofy courtroom scene in which Ted and Willy first come face to face, and could have benefited from even more of the same.
 
 There are references in the film to class issues and an ostensible morality battle for Willy's soul, but it's essentially an average episode of "Law & Order" gussied up with glossy visuals and stretched to feature length. What it's really about is the Making of a Movie Star.
 
 Gosling earned the respect of critics in 2001 with "The Believer," scored box-office cred in 2004's "The Notebook," and an Oscar nomination, Spirit Award and a slew of other kudos for "Half Nelson." But what "Fracture" gives Gosling is the kind of pairing that helped elevate Tom Cruise and Kevin Costner to superstardom 20 years ago. Cruise squared off against Paul Newman in "The Color of Money" and Dustin Hoffman in "Rain Man," while Costner was tangling with Gene Hackman in "No Way Out" and Sean Connery in "The Untouchables." Forget romantic chemistry, it's the mano-a-mano, passing-of-the-torch fireworks that really launches an actor into the stratosphere in the age of the blockbuster.
 
 "Fracture" is at its best when Hopkins and Gosling are on screen together, bobbing and weaving with considerable aplomb. It boils down to experience's arrogance, intellect and wealth versus youth's cockiness, resilience and hard work, and the actors appear to have a good time playing the game.
 
 The movie grows a little more tiresome and plodding when dealing with Willy's moral dilemmas and the less-than-convincing romance that develops with his future corporate boss, Nikki (Rosamund Pike). David Strathairn ably plays the pragmatic D.A., but his scenes with Gosling in which they discuss the hard lessons of the great comeuppance play pretty dry compared with the rest of the movie.
 
 
 "Fracture." MPAA rating: R for language and some violent content. Run time: 1 hour, 53 minutes.   

Anthony Hopkins, as a smirky evil genius trying to get away with murder by confessing to it, and Ryan Gosling, as the sharkish junior prosecutor who becomes obsessed with getting him convicted, are such stylishly well-matched antagonists in Fracture  that it's tempting to say they elevate a conventional, even corny, legal thriller. But that would be to shortchange the film, which has been directed, by Gregory Hoblit, with some of the same hokey-smart trapdoor cleverness he brought to Primal Fear  11 years ago.
The two actors are  terrific. Hopkins, doing a gloss on Hannibal Lecter's mannerisms, invites us to relish that soft-voiced Welsh burr  he spreads the intellectual superiority like butter  and jack-o'-lantern grin. Gosling plays Willy Beachum, who's about to leave the DA's office for a poshly cutthroat corporate job. Speaking in a sexy light drawl (he's supposed to be upwardly mobile ''white trash,'' like Clarice Starling) and raising his eyebrows into dancing half circles, Gosling makes Willy a conflicted yuppie Hamlet. Fracture  has a gourmet-popcorn finesse. It's just good enough to be called Hitchcockian  which means, of course, that the movie is really all about the questions , those pesky little unsolved mysteries that spank each scene along because they're keys to the personalities on display.
Hopkins' Ted Crawford, who is some sort of fabled aeronautics engineer, knows that his  lovely younger wife (Embeth Davidtz) is having an affair. When she arrives home  they live in one of those sleek real-estate-porn L.A. ranch-house palaces  he pulls out a handgun and shoots her in the head. The dastardly deed has, of course, been perfectly set up. When the cops arrive, Crawford's wife is still clinging to life, and they send in a hostage negotiator (Billy Burke), who turns out to be her lover from the opening scene. Crawford goads him into a scuffle (which won't exactly make the cop look objective later on), and when the house is searched, the fatal weapon has disappeared.
How did Crawford get rid of it? On paper, that's a mechanical enigma, yet the question prods us, nags at us, keeps turning around in our heads. It's an issue of character  the key, really, to Crawford's malign brilliance  so it adds flesh, or at least the illusion of it, to the mystery's bones. Crawford starts to act as his own attorney, and Willy, for a while, wants no part of the case; he wants to be out the door to his new job at a deluxe WASP firm, the kind that earns its lucre by defending the worst corporate predators. But Crawford fastens on to him, taunting him, looking for his ''fracture'' point. Hopkins and Gosling just about lock frontal lobes  their duels shoot off volts. As Willy starts to lose, his instincts as a lawyer begin to trump his ambition, and he can't let the case go. We know the feeling. It may be obvious that Fracture  is working on us, playing us, but that's its pleasure. It makes overwrought manipulation seem more than a basic instinct.

 The glib entertainment “Fracture” offers an assortment of tasty treats, notably the spectacle of that crafty scene stealer Anthony Hopkins mixing it up with that equally cunning screen nibbler Ryan Gosling. They’re beautiful slummers, these two, as well oiled and practiced as those great old-studio dissemblers who worked a soundstage to their and Louis B. Mayer’s advantage. The only difference is that once upon a time Joan Crawford would have whispered dangerous nothings into Mr. Hopkins’s ear,  not Mr. Gosling.  There are a couple of women onboard in “Fracture,” though as usual they’re mostly around to look good and play (almost) dead. Embeth Davidtz slips nicely into the ill-fated little woman role, the one mentioned in the eye-catching advertisements that feature Mr. Hopkins softly smiling under the words “I shot my wife.” As the smiler with the wife, Mr. Hopkins’s Ted Crawford does something complicated looking with airplanes, barks monosyllabic instructions at underlings (“No!”) and leaves the world choking on his Porche-churned dust. He also points and shoots, sending a bullet into his spouse’s pampered cheek during the film’s precision-timed opener, leaving a hole in her head as well as, presumably, his alibi.  We know that Ted Crawford done it and perhaps why — some rumpled hotel sheets provide one steamy clue — the big question, the one that sets the plot a-churning and Mr. Gosling’s lawyer-character a-calling, is how the bad man plans to get away with it. All in good time, my pretties, all in good time.  First, the lawyer, Willy Beachum, must provide some storybook diversion, mainly in the form of a high-paying, potentially soul-killing new job that will take him out of the public service, where he works for the Los Angeles district attorney’s office (which knows a little something if sometimes not enough about rich men accused of murdering the women in their lives), and into the well-upholstered evil of the private sector.  Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Gosling navigate the film’s  sleekly burnished surfaces and darkly lighted interiors, its procedural twists and courtroom turns without breaking stride or into a sweat. Each actor is playing a pulp type rather than a fully formed individual, but both fill in the blanks with an alchemical mix of professional and personal charisma. (Mr. Gosling also tosses in a Southern accent.)  Even Mr. Hopkins’s most familiar tricks — a blank face capped by a hint of a shiver-inducing smile — work to the story’s advantage. In a less capable film those gently upturned lips could easily repulse because they would invoke unfavorable comparisons with Hannibal Lecter; here, though, they simply remind you that memorable screen villainy can be as much a matter of impeccable manners as evil designs.  The screenwriters, Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers, hit the customary thriller notes with a touch of humor, and the director, Gregory Hoblit (who worked similar terrain in “Primal Fear”), arranges those notes into a catchy, insistent rhythm. There are a few loose  ends, but questions of logic have a way of receding in a film in which the bad man can be seen reflected in a pool of his victim’s blood. “Fracture” isn’t a movie about ideas; it’s about slick surfaces and suggestive adjectives like rich and poor, good and evil, weak and strong. It’s about the functionally ornamental Rosamund Pike, who delivers her goods in a tight sweater as Beachum’s romantic foil, and the invariably reliable David Strathairn, who delivers his with a firm jaw as the younger man’s moral conscience.  Finally, and without shame, it is about Mr. Gosling making some dough and Mr. Hopkins punching the clock,  as much for their obvious pleasure as ours.  “Fracture” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Some graphic violence mixed in with some circumspect sex. 

An open-and-shut case becomes an elegantly framed battle of wits in "Fracture," an absorbing legal thriller that can't help but taste like exquisitely reheated leftovers. Meticulously crafted drama has plenty to recommend itself -- fair-play crime plotting, Ryan Gosling's skillful performance as a conflicted prosecutor, an unexpectedly droll sense of humor -- but is ultimately less concerned with mounting suspense than burdening its protagonist with bogus moral dilemmas. Result is a smooth, proficient but curiously bloodless entertainment to which older viewers will raise few objections, though "Fracture" likely won't break any box office records.
After focusing on a defense attorney and a client of questionable innocence in 1996's "Primal Fear," helmer Gregory Hoblit here pits a prosecutor against a defendant who's guilty as sin from the get-go.
Elderly engineer Ted Crawford (Anthony Hopkins) is on trial for the attempted murder of his wife, Jennifer (Embeth Davidtz, "Junebug"), in their Southern California luxury home. Viewer follows Ted through every stage of his carefully premeditated crime -- from the moment he calmly shoots Jennifer in the head to his confrontation with hostage negotiator Rob Nunally (Billy Burke), who is shocked when he realizes that the unconscious woman on the floor is none other than his lover.
Boldly implausible twist is the first tip-off that Ted has devised one hell of an escape route. Jennifer survives but remains in a coma, and the state's case falls to hotshot prosecutor Willy Beachum (Gosling), who has an impressive conviction rate and one foot already out the door: He's leaving the Los Angeles criminal court system, against the wishes of the D.A. (David Strathairn), to work at an upscale private law firm. But given the strength of the evidence against Ted, surely he can close the case in a week, right?
Not quite. Ted's field of expertise is fracture mechanics, a tool for spotting structural flaws in aeronautical systems and, here, a metaphor for establishing reasonable doubt. Pic's wittiest scenes are those in which Ted, acting as his own counsel, slyly demolishes Willy's case -- to say nothing of his ego and career prospects.
Those prospects are embodied in the seductive form of Willy's boss-to-be, blond ice-goddess Nikki Gardner (Rosamund Pike), who wants her new hire to drop the case and switch over to the dark side already. (She also wants his bod, of course.) This lengthy subplot, which seemingly demonstrates that only sellouts work in corporate law, could easily have been stricken from Daniel Pyne and Glenn Gers' otherwise shrewd screenplay.
Willy is saddled with such ethical quandaries throughout -- at one point, a vengeful Nunally suggests they falsify evidence -- and the story is as much invested in his personal and professional choices as it is in the trial's outcome. Climax draws these threads together tidily and plausibly, though the scrupulously foreshadowed revelations won't surprise viewers who've been paying attention.
After his rivetingly authentic turn as a strung-out schoolteacher in "Half Nelson," Gosling again impresses in a slicker, more conventionally outlined role. Looking preternaturally boyish with his tall, lanky frame, even in a suit and tie, thesp delivers a charmingly off-kilter performance with a vague air of perpetual distraction, subtly charting Willy's journey from cocksure arrogance to crushing defeat, followed by dogged persistence and dawning sense of responsibility and triumph.
Only thing missing is a sense of his rhetorical chops; while it's implied that Willy is less gifted than opportunistic, more scenes of the young attorney passionately arguing his case would have added credibility. But "Fracture" isn't, in the end, much of a legal drama; pic devotes little time to the actual trial and steers well clear of histrionics, as if to suggest the most important decisions and discoveries are made outside the courtroom.
Hopkins savors his part with soft-spoken relish, at first playing Ted as a malevolent clown -- feigning cluelessness about the legal system, dropping vulgarisms in court with exquisite timing -- only to brilliantly turn the tables. Taunting Willy from behind bars in a voice dripping with mock-paternal sadism, Hopkins at times seems to be channeling his Hannibal Lecter from "The Silence of the Lambs" (and, to a lesser degree, its inferior offshoots).
But the specter of "Silence" also exposes Ted as more construct than character -- the sort of devious, only-in-the-movies mastermind who kills for the sheer thrill of getting away with it. Not helping to combat this idea is the unexamined nature of Ted and Jennifer's marriage; audiences have seen a lot of loveless May-September unions, and this one, no thanks to Davidtz's largely comatose role, never comes into focus.
Other thesps are strong, especially Strathairn as the stern but compassionate D.A. and Burke as the weak-willed cop who becomes an angry figure of disgrace.
Though informed by Hoblit's experience directing episodes of "NYPD Blue" and "L.A. Law," "Fracture" has been given a much moodier visual treatment than is the norm for television, cramming all manner of disorienting, at times claustrophobic camera angles into the widescreen frame. Production design gets at underlying themes of class mobility, contrasting Ted's swanky estate with Willy's more modest abode, or the cramped public courthouse with the sterile, spacious offices of a private firm.
Burnt-orange sunsets and extensive nocturnal shooting in downtown L.A., from the Walt Disney Concert Hall to the roof of the Standard Hotel, give the film a highly studied sense of place. Credit also must go to Dutch artist Mark Bischoff, whose astonishing Rube Goldberg-like mechanisms figure inventively into the story. All other tech contributions are supremely polished. 


This week's generically titled studio suspense thriller, Fracture , has the good sense to begin where last week's generically titled studio suspense thriller, Perfect Stranger , endedwith the solution to that tedious riddle: Whodunit? The answer this time is Anthony Hopkins  as Ted Crawford , an aeronautical engineer whose pockets of money and glassy modernist mansion aren't enough to dissuade his much younger wife (Embeth Davidtz ) from canoodling with an off-duty cop. So, with a cool composure of which Hannibal Lecter  would surely approve, Crawford puts a bullet in her head and, following a brief standoff, surrenders to the police. He even confesses to the crime, as anyone who has seen the movie's ad campaign (posters of Hopkins's mug with the words "I shot my wife" writ large) already knows. It would seem to be an open-and-shut case if ever there was onea cinch for Willy Beachum  (Ryan Gosling ), a deputy Los Angeles D.A. with a 97-percent conviction rate, a cocksure swagger, and a job awaiting him at one of those tony corporate law firms where, in the words of Beachum's world-weary boss (David Strathairn ), "everyone plays squash and has middle initials."
Only, Beachum's last stand as a public servant isn't as simple as all thatthere wouldn't be a movie if it werefor no sooner does he deliver his opening remarks than all of his seemingly airtight evidence begins to go the way of O.J.'s bloody glove. For starters, there's Crawford's confession, which just happens to have been given in the presence of the very detective who was going under the covers with the now comatose Mrs. Crawford. And as for the gun taken from Crawford's hand at the scene? Turns out it's never even been fired. Providing his own defense with a mix of stumblebum buffoonery and canny legal savvy, Crawford sits across the courtroom from the miffed Beachum, watching each new revelation drop with sadistic glee. When they meet face-to-face in Crawford's cella subterranean chamber attended by a green, gaseous glow, as if to signal some sort of hellish kingdomCrawford offers his young adversary a crash course in Engineering 101: Everythingand everyonehas a weak spot at which it can break, he says, and Beachum's is his lust for success.
Directed by Gregory Hoblit  from an enjoyable knotty script by Daniel Pyne  and Glenn Gers , Fracture isn't a great moviethe self-serious early scenes, especially, are the stuff that Skinemax is made ofbut it hums with the insidious smarts and theatrical flair that made Hoblit's debut feature, Primal Fear , a classic of its kind. Like that picture, this one takes a legal procedural that reeks of week-old Law & Order and pulls it off with unexpected zeal by playing up the bassline instead of the melody and by offering us the spectacle of two gifted actors working at the top of their game. It's smart enough to realize that what turns a trialbe it fictional or evening-news varietyinto high drama usually has less to do with the case itself than with the outsize personalities of its players, the carnival atmosphere of the courtroom, and the macabre thrill of watching a diabolically clever defendant potentially get away with murder. It's also one of the rare American films to openly address matters of class and wealthcall it The Pursuit of Unhappyness and the more it progresses, the more Fracture  becomes something of a gallows comedy about the price of ambition in the big city, with the working-class Beachum a variation on the classic film-noir protagonist who finds himself paying a steep price for daring to want too much.
Fracture which seems destined to do for low-paying public-prosecutor jobs what Top Gun did for Naval recruitmentcould have been done up all dreary and straight. But under Hoblit's direction, the actors tear into their roles. Hopkins, who has spent far too much of his post Silence of the Lambs career regurgitating Hannibal the Cannibal as a dinner-theater caricature, plays Crawford the way he played Lecter the first time around: close to the vest, with touches of romantic melodramaa madman fully in possession of his faculties and all the more chilling for it. It's Gosling, though, who continues to astonish, and if Beachum seems an even bigger revelation than his Oscar-nominated Half Nelson turn, it's because the role as written gives him so much less to work with. Gosling owns the part, his eyes afire with the hunger of those who have spent a lifetime angling for a room at the top, or even in the building. On-screen, Gosling is so focused, yet so loose and at ease, that his every movement and gesture flows as naturally as the words from his mouth. He's the kind of actor who makes other actors look lazy. He is Brando at the time of Streetcar , or Nicholson in Five Easy Pieces , and altogether one of the more remarkable happenings at the movies today.
