Like a steady 12-bar blues progression, Black Snake Moan
 (the title of a Blind Lemon Jefferson tune) lays down a groove and works its chords over and over 'til their energy is spent. Following up on his arresting debut film, Hustle & Flow
, Brewer here sticks with the theme of the power of music to redeem lost souls. Brewer again sets his film firmly in the soil of the South, a place where things are just, well, steamier. The heat is also well-suited to the exploitation-film model the writer/director employs, borrowing not only from the most salacious elements of the grindhouse formula but also bits from films such as � And God Created Woman
 and Baby Doll
. In her cutoff short-shorts and midriff-baring Confederate T-shirt, Rae (Ricci) is the embodiment of all those nympho predecessors � a woman with an itch down below that can�t be relieved no matter how often it�s scratched, which is frequently. It�s a sickness, a curse, and now that her boyfriend Ronnie (Timberlake) has shipped out to boot camp before heading to Iraq, her disease has gotten worse. The film opens with Rae and Ronnie hot in the throes of vigorous goodbye sex and then watches as she gets continuously drunker while screwing everything that isn�t already nailed down. Rae�s path of self-destruction leads her to a dirt road where she�s found lying in a semiunconscious state in nothing but her underpants and above-mentioned T. And who�s there to raise her from the dead but the farmer Lazarus (Jackson), who discovers her while taking out his own trash. A former blues musician, Lazarus is in the dumps because his wife just left him for his brother � a classic blues riff in itself. So he takes her in and does his best to heal her but finds her cough much easier to relieve than her itch. When Bible-reading doesn�t quell the inflammation, Lazarus chains Rae to the radiator, which gives rise to the film�s iconic image � chained heat, indeed. Yes, it�s all outrageous and patently stereotypical, but Brewer and the actors invest these representations with everything they have. It�s great to see Jackson working hard here to create a character instead of simply Superflying a bunch of %!#@ snakes on a plane. Ricci is better than ever, and Timberlake, on the heels of Alpha Dog
 is turning into a decent actor.) Yet to dismiss this film as an over-the-top throwback is to shut out the melody. Black Snake Moan
 is to the blues what Pulp Fiction
 is to the dime-store novel, a fleshed-out personification of the genre�s tropes. Well, Rae and Lazarus are kindred spirits because they both have a case of the blue devils; both are drowning in their personal woes because love, as the legendary bluesman Son House states in the film�s preamble, makes you do things you don�t want to do. The story is as humorous and raunchy as a good blues refrain, and the way Lazarus and Rae react to each other almost resembles the classic call-and-response structure of the blues. Perhaps Brewer might have ultimately devised ways to lift his story from the sociological constraints of the Southern blues imagery, but there�s no denying his perfection of the onscreen blues riff.


Maybe it's because Christina Ricci's tattered Confederate halter-top has a flag for each breast. Maybe it's because Samuel L. Jackson , in the most interesting performance he's given in years, looks like both Sanford and son. Or maybe it's because Justin Timberlake has a significant part in a movie where everybody sings but him. But Craig Brewer's "Black Snake Moan" is why I go to the movies.
There's a special thrill in watching a filmmaker momentarily lose his mind. Even before Jackson's character, a farming Memphis bluesman named Lazarus, chains Ricci's sex addict up to his radiator, Brewer's movie is a hot-blooded provocation about lust and race, though not necessarily at the same time. It's out to shock and entertain. This movie is crazy, but the insanity is electric.
"Black Snake Moan" is about a woman's attempt to kick her nasty habit. But it also feels like a director's attempt to kick his own misogyny. Brewer's last movie was "Hustle & Flow," in which Terrence Howard played a pimp with a trio of hookers who got on his nerves. The women were 57 varieties of skanky, but rarely human. "Black Snake Moan" feels like a gradual atonement for the previous movie's limited imagination regarding women in the eyes of men. Brewer can now imagine a man lifting a finger to help a woman in need. Admittedly, the help is outrageous: Ricci's wastrel, Rae, wakes up with a stud-link anchor chain wrapped around her inexplicably toned waist.
She finds herself in this position after her jittery soldier boyfriend, Ronnie (Timberlake) , leaves for basic training. His ride has barely pulled away from his country shack when Rae collapses in the grass and writhes in excruciated ecstasy, jamming her hands between her legs: Yes, she's gotta have it, and have it she does, proverbially -- no, wait almost literally -- with every Tom, Dick, and Harry in town. Sassy and sleazy, she's a walking, talking mud flap. (One of her regulars is the local pimp played by the dirty-sexy rapper David Banner , whose drawl constitutes a foreign language.)
After a long night of bopping around a party drunk, tripping on OxyContin , and being left on a lawn with all the other refuse, Rae is assaulted and dumped on the side of the road like a half-empty Cinch Sack. Old Lazarus finds her bloodied and barely dressed the following morning as he's taking out his own garbage. Lazarus was on a bender himself the night before. His wife just left him for his younger brother, and he messed up his house in miserable celebration.
As a matter of safety , Lazarus scoops up Rae and takes her into his home. He does some snooping around town, worried that whoever did this to her might be black. (Not so.) But as Banner's pimp reports, she's just a nympho in need of a cure: "Collar that dawg," he says. And so after Rae slithers and wails on the living room floor -- still bloodied and half-naked -- and Lazarus's attempts at a Holy Bible exorcism fail, his rehab turns hard - core, and out come the chains.
"Look girl," Jackson explains, the gospel of disgust rising in his voice in that chilling Samuel L. Jackson way, "You been running wild!" Of course, finding her a clean pair of short shorts seems to take longer than cleansing her soul.
"Black Snake Moan" builds to Ricci's enslavement with a surprising sense of drama. The soundtrack deploys thundering rhythmic blues that seem to get louder with every scene. Brewer convincingly declares himself a serious exploitation director. His movie is like Roger Corman directing Timbaland and Nelly Furtado in a deep-fried version of "Caged Heat."
Next to shameless showmanship, regional authenticity is his other big asset. He's a white guy from Memphis, and his decision to leave rap music alone for this new picture and try the blues is smart. For one thing it makes room for the juke-joint drama that was missing in the risible recording sessions of "Hustle & Flow."
More crucially, the blues is capacious enough for the sexual and romantic ache that hip-hop is too macho to admit. In his first movie, Brewer got lucky, since Terrence Howard put blues-tinged longing in his rapping pimp. But "Black Snake Moan" rumbles with real hurt.
The movie, whose title comes from a Blind Lemon Jefferson song, is bookended with the spiritually restless Delta Blues pioneer Son House , who is shown in several archival cutaways. But the music seeps into the dialogue in some early scenes between Lazarus and his wife (Adriane Lenox ) that might as well be from a Buddy Guy-Koko Taylor duet. And Jackson reaches into himself, showing all manners of disgust, shame, rage, heartbreak, and -- how could I forget -- complete derangement. Not since "Jungle Fever" has he been so vulnerably human.
Ricci is so good at being so sub human that you're forced to wonder if she's just more perceptive than the rest of us. Is there a woman in that character? Scarcely. But resembling no one so much as a baby Susan Sarandon (those wide, feral eyes), she goes at the part with mind-boggling abandon, anyway. Both she and Jackson give themselves over to Brewer's nuttiness in a way that forces you to wonder during every single scene: What were they thinking?
By the second half of the picture, Brewer starts to come to his senses, and the movie loses its kick. When the chains come off Rae, he more or less applies them himself. It's as if the power of the movie's sexual absurdity scared him too. Soon we learn of Rae's tragic childhood. Then Timberlake's soldier comes home, and the movie turns into a psychologizing melodrama about redemption and reconciliation. None of the sexual-racial lines the movie seems hurtling toward are crossed.
The loss of nerve is a letdown that feels like both a commercial concession and a way to keep the peace. Had the old black man and the young white chick gotten it on, I think some audiences might have exploded. Perhaps sensing this, "Black Snake Moan" backs off, giving us a neat and clean Hallmark card ending that leaves you worried that Brewer's sexorcism did a number on him, too.


         If you name a character Lazarus in a story about two people whose damaged hearts need reviving, you're well-served to cast Samuel L. Jackson. During a career in which the actor has raised righteous indignation to an art form, Jackson has proved time and again that the quality of the material is beside the point. The man is going to orate and you are going to listen.
 
  And you will
 listen.
 


         






    Though "Black Snake Moan" is unadulterated deep-fried silliness from "Hustle & Flow" filmmaker Craig Brewer, Jackson makes it indisputably more palatable. It's still not a very good movie, but it's intermittently entertaining (and sometimes unintentionally funny).
 
  Jackson plays the bluesman named Lazarus, who years earlier laid down his guitar when he found religion, married and settled into farming. But the blues are simmering within him once again because his wife left him for his brother.
 
  Meanwhile, in a nearby trailer, Ronnie (Justin Timberlake), a National Guardsman with a nasty case of the yips gets called up for duty and says a lusty goodbye to his hellcat girlfriend, Rae (Christina Ricci). Distraught and lonely after Ronnie's departure, Rae doesn't lose any time getting wasted and embarking on a sexual rampage that leaves her beaten and bloodied in a ditch up the road from Laz's farm.
 
  He scoops up her tiny white body in his big black arms and before you can say "Mandingo," he's shackled her to the radiator in his house using a 40-pound chain. But lest the movie's lascivious billboards give you the wrong idea, you must be forewarned that Laz's intentions are pure — if false imprisonment can be called pure — and he tells the practically tubercular Rae, "I aim to cure you of your wickedness." What follows is an evangelical exorcism.
 
  The fevered scenario feels ripped from "The Jerry Springer Show," but the execution is more T.D. Jakes with a Dr. Phil chaser. There are some overcooked scenes of Ricci going at it with Timberlake and being on the receiving end of some rough sex with Tehronne (David Banner), the local drug dealer and part-time pimp, but the film's steamiest scene actually involves fully-clothed dancing in a juke joint.
 
  Much of "Black Snake Moan" has a fire-and-brimstone tone as Laz reads scripture for counsel on how to rid Rae of her ravenous promiscuity and calls in his spiritual advisor, Preacher R.L. (John Cothran), when the going gets really tough. But it's love that is the ultimate antidote to the soul-crushing sadness that plagues the characters, and that is too easy of an out.
 
  If you can get past the more misogynistic imagery, there are some tender moments between Jackson and Ricci. He becomes downright paternal in his protectiveness and she beams at him in wide-eyed gratitude.
 
  There's an odd timelessness to the movie. It's set in the present day, but it bears a fable-like quality. Laz seems to make a decent living as a one-man ag unit, hauling his produce to town and quaintly selling it from the bed of his truck. Although the story provocatively places race front-and-center, Brewer does not really address it. In the town, blacks and whites eye one another suspiciously but appear to otherwise live in parallel universes where conflicts are almost nonexistent.
 
  As with "Hustle & Flow," which put Brewer on the map two years ago, the writer-director displays a real passion for the music and a knack for using it to create mood. But it's not enough to overcome the thinness of his characters or the greeting card sentiment that pulls the rug out from what came be-fore.
 
 
  "Black Snake Moan." MPAA rating: R for strong sexual content, language, some violence and drug use. 1 hour, 56 minutes. In general release.   

In Black Snake Moan , Christina Ricci plays Rae, a backwoods Tennessee baby doll who's been done wrong all her life  beginning with her daddy's dirty hands  and that's why she's now a raging nymphomaniac: When Rae's one true love, Ronnie (Justin Timberlake, Renaissance man!), ships off to Army boot camp, she's instantly itchier and wilder than a cat on a hot tin movie set. To quote the precise medical diagnosis of one of the townsfolk: ''She got dat sickness. She gotta get d--- or she go crazy.'' Stat!
Samuel L. Jackson plays Lazarus, a Memphis musician who's been done wrong by his wife  she's run off with Laz's brother  and that's why he has stopped singing God's gift of the blues and done taken up religion. Rae's angry, he's  angrier. She's white, tiny, and near-naked; he's big, black, and clothed in righteousness, telling her, ''I aim to cure you of your wickedness. You sick. You gonna mahhhhnd  me.'' He chains her to a radiator for her own good and sings to her, and she comes to love him for it and... huh ? The mind wanders: Why has that petite actress got a big old heavy chain locked around her nekkid waist? Why does Jackson wear such a flashy set of grills? Why do these blues feel so imitative, so pretend, so green?
There's no way, no way at all, to enter writer-director Craig Brewer's wet, hot, lurid Bible lesson and music jamboree except to throw your hands up in the air, do a little shimmy, and jump. Jump into the steamy B-movie, exploitation gospel pulp of it all, from the same filmmaker who took it upon himself to explain exactly how hard it is out there for a pimp with 2005's Hustle & Flow . Jump for the fervent, wild-eyed corniness of the thing, the baroque psychosexual-racial titillation, the hoppin' chutzpah of a movie that preaches the gospel of the old title tune by Blind Lemon Jefferson, made accessible to boys and men who mostly want to see Ricci's peachies.
Heck, jump for the chance to see the slip-slim, saucer-eyed star  it's been many days since she played Wednesday in The Addams Family   arch and moan and writhe with abandon, acting out sexual addiction as a fever of lust and emotional emptiness that entitles the camera to focus on her little white underpants. The picture would have been a whole other kettle of blackened catfish had Rae been played by an unknown, or a clothed chick. But that's not what's for sale here; showbiz is.
So jump  but be prepared to collapse into a hoot and a howl of hilarity at all the wrong moments, like when thunder rattles and Lazarus rises from his inner deadness through song and Rae clings to his leg and peers through the dark of her abused past into the light  a ray? Or when Ronnie returns with severe heebie-jeebies of his own. Or when another local sage prescribes, ''Ain't no better [cure] for de blues than some good p---y.'' Say amen, somebody?

 Like its predecessor, the Sundance hype-magnet “Hustle & Flow,” Craig Brewer’s new film, “Black Snake Moan,” comes cloaked in lurid, pulpy atmospherics. His characters — pimps, prostitutes, nymphomaniacs — seem to have crawled off the drugstore paperback racks of the 1950s or the grind house lobby posters of a slightly later era. His stories are slick with the grease of old-style exploitation, promising the sleazy, easy pleasures of lust, wrath and other deadly sins.  Don’t be fooled though. Underneath the surface of racial and sexual button pushing, behind the brandished guns and bared breasts, is a heart of pure, buttery cornpone. Like “Hustle & Flow,” “Black Snake Moan” joins a dubious stereotype of black manhood to an uplifting, sentimental fable. In the earlier movie the hero was a soulful pimp with dreams of hip-hop glory.  This time he is a retired blues singer with woman  troubles and a vegetable farm. Really, though, the character, played with his usual fearsome wit by Samuel L. Jackson, is a tried-and-true Hollywood stock figure: the selfless, spiritually minded African-American who seems to have been put on the earth to help white people work out their self-esteem issues. No doubt “Black Snake Moan” is a provocative title, but a more accurate one might be “Chaining Miss Daisy to the Radiator in Her Underwear.”  About that chain. You may have seen it, clutched in Mr. Jackson’s fists and looped around Christina Ricci’s bare midriff, in advertisements for this movie. A white woman, a black man and a chain: it’s hard to think of an image more likely to inflame the demons of the American id. But this is not a movie about sexual bondage or payback for slavery — not exactly, anyway. It’s overtly and insistently about recovery and healing, the slaying of personal demons by any means necessary.  Mr. Jackson is Lazarus, whose wife, apparently bored by his upright ways, has run off with his brother. Ms. Ricci plays Rae, a troubled young woman well known around their small Tennessee town for her sexual availability. When her boyfriend, Ronnie (the increasingly credible Justin Timberlake), leaves for the Army, Rae falls into a bad old pattern. She suffers from “spells” of erotic craving that begin with twitching, coughing and fever and compel her to jump on anything with a Y chromosome and a pulse.  One morning Lazarus finds her, badly beaten and barely clothed, at the side of the road near his house. He takes her home, washes her wounds and fetches her some medicine. (Only later will it occur to him to fetch her something to wear besides the white underpants and chopped-off T-shirt the camera prefers to see her in.) When she tries to jump on him, he grabs his Bible and flees into the yard, leaving the Good Book open to the verse (missing in my copy) about chains and radiators as instruments of righteousness.  Whatever works. To their great credit, Mr. Jackson and Ms. Ricci understand that the relationship between Lazarus and his prisoner has its comic side, and some of their scenes together — as when he takes her for a walk in his garden, using the chain as a leash, or when she is reeled in across the porch like an angry wide-mouthed bass — play out like kinky screwball. Whether Mr. Brewer is in on the joke is less clear. In an early review in Film Comment that is at least as entertaining as “Black Snake Moan” itself, Nathan Lee has proclaimed Mr. Brewer a “visionary.” From where I sit, the vision looks pretty blurry, as the movie struggles to square its inherent absurdity with its earnest sense of conviction.  Ms. Ricci, feral and saucer-eyed, throws herself into a role that is ultimately as threadbare as her T-shirt. Mr. Jackson, rarely bothered by characters that make no sense — he was the star of both John Singleton’s “Shaft” remake and “Snakes on a Plane” after all — redeems Lazarus with his wily professionalism, much as Terrence Howard redeemed DJay in “Hustle & Flow.” Mr. Jackson also benefits from the presence of capable character actors like S. Epatha Merkerson, as the pharmacist who is Lazarus’s grown-up, fully dressed love interest, and John Cothran, as his friend the preacher.  For all its willful, shaking-and-shouting intensity, “Black Snake Moan” never lives up to its soundtrack, which is as saturated with the blues as “Hustle & Flow” was with the crunk sounds of Southern hip-hop. The songs from the Fat Possum Records catalog that play under much of the action, and two short archival clips of the great Son House explicating the place of sexual jealousy in his music, contain more pain, humor and wisdom than the entirety of Mr. Brewer’s overloaded, overheated script. As a writer he combines a reasonably good ear for Southern idioms with a weakness for prosy exposition. In spite of Amelia Vincent’s toothsome cinematography and the down-home locations, the movie often has the lumbering, literal-minded rhythms of a second-rate stage play — not a moan or a howl, but a slow, anxious groan.  “Black Snake Moan” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Half-naked nymphomaniac chained to radiator.

Mix Brigitte Bardot in "And God Created Woman" with Carroll Baker in "Baby Doll," sex it up times 10 and you have a notion of the effect of Christina Ricci in "Black Snake Moan." Part sleazy Southern exploitation pic about a wild firecat that would have made Erskine Caldwell blush, part blues-infused "Pygmalion" story about the tramp's reformation at the hands of an older black man, Craig Brewer's follow-up to his 2005 Sundance winner "Hustle & Flow" probably will find its most eager audience among college-age guys hot to ogle the young star in some very raw action.
The film, set in a small Tennessee town that seems populated in equal measure by just-getting-by white and black folk, is a strange brew. The first part introduces a massively messed-up character in a boldly lascivious manner: The ultra-trashy Rae (Ricci) has a desperate final screw with her Iraq-bound National Guard b.f. (Justin Timberlake), almost immediately thereafter gets it on with beefy black drug dealer Tehronne (David Banner) and then gets so wasted at a dance that she's available for the taking by anyone.
After a bloodied, unconscious Rae is found by the side of the road next morning and taken in by middle-aged farmer Lazarus (Samuel L. Jackson, with graying hair and beard), whose wife has just left him, the pace lets up a bit. Until, that is, Rae comes to, whereupon her crazed reaction to her new surroundings and caretaker provoke Lazarus to chain her to the radiator.
"I aim to cure you of your wickedness," announces Lazarus, having been informed by Tehronne of Rae's "sickness." As she herself explains, she's got an itch, which means she gotta have it, and Rae's immediate instinct is to offer herself to Lazarus in exchange for her freedom. But that's not part of his mission and, no matter what others think of his harboring the local slut in his home, Lazarus is determined to try to break Rae of her wildness, like a horse.
As Rae's behavior reduces to simmer, however, the provocation quotient lowers as well and pic begins to log quite a bit of downtime. Lazarus pulls out his guitar, practices some tunes and, in a rollicking sequence, plays in public for the first time at a bar, where a freed Rae dances with abandon.
Lazarus finds himself on the receiving end of gentle overtures from a nice lady (the wonderful S. Epatha Merkerson) in a slow-burning relationship and, with the help of the local preacher (John Cothran Jr.), Rae may be put on a road toward survival.
It's obvious from this film and "Hustle & Flow" that music means a great deal to Brewer, and hardcore blues fans may groove on every minute of the musicianship here. But the dramatic line suffers considerably from the truckful of tunes offered up, resulting in a well-executed, handsome-looking film that runs perhaps 20 minutes longer than it should given its storyline.
Toplined Jackson is very fine as the principled, emotionally tender but tough-talking country man who, befitting his name, takes it upon himself to bring the community's most scorned woman back to life. Supporting perfs are forceful and/or appealing as required.
But it is Ricci who will be remembered when all else about the film has been forgotten. Her large oval face dominating her tiny body, which is exceptionally thin around the waist, Ricci is clad in scanty cutoffs, panties, midriff-baring shirts at most and often less. Here she is a feral animal, a force of nature, a wild thing with a ferocious physicality and a sexuality like Vesuvius in its prime. Her Rae is Eros unplugged, unquenchable, inexhaustible. Fascinating, scary and entirely debauched, Rae is the sort of female creature who has been seen onscreen many times before, but rarely, or perhaps never, so bluntly portrayed in a Hollywood studio film.

It may be hard out there for a pimp, but it ain't too hard for a writer-director to make a movie whose marketing hinges on the lurid spectacle of Samuel L. Jackson  pulling a half-naked Christina Ricci  around on a chain. This sort of cheap trick is what they used to call exploitation or, more to the point, blaxploitation ; despite the sounds of them, neither term is derogatory, at least not toward the movies. Ex- and blax- formulas are merely the short cuts that underprivileged properties take to getting themselves funded and promoted and seen: Put a (black) man pulling a half-naked (white) woman around on a chain in your pitch/poster/trailer and, particularly if your last feature was the pimpin'-ain't-easy Oscar-winner Hustle & Flow , you got a deal. Matter of fact, you might also have a masterpiece, since such a great movie can, in theory, be made from any subjectincluding that of a smooth-rappin' pimp who gets his house in order and his hos, too.
Alas, theory ain't shit when the final cut is due, and, just as Flow -maker Craig Brewer  ain't Melvin Van Peebles  (or John Waters  or Russ Meyer  or Larry Cohen  or Katt Shea Ruben), Black Snake Moan  sho-nuff ain't no Sweetback . Indeed, long stretches of Brewer's Suthun-fried sophomore slump come down the country road lookin' as haggard as a workaholic ho on a Sunday morning. (Yes, this review is a piece of exploitation, too.) As in Flow , Brewer only allows himself so much nasty fun before it's time to issue his trick-turners their hard-earned redemption: Jackson's chain-yankin' Lazarus learns to temper his righteous indignation; Ricci's Rae, she of the belly-baring Confederate flag-tee and unclean panties, puts on some decent clothes and even reckons she might get hitched; the filmmaker begins to direct his grindhouse fantasy of female enslavement as if it were Our Town .
At least Brewer knows well the first rule of exploitation, which is that if the premise don't fit on a condom wrapper or a piece of rolling paper, it ain't a movie. This one could fit on one of Rae's sorely needed cough drops: Cruelly cuckolded middle-aged Tennessee farmer and part-time bluesman goes to take out the garbage, finds a piece of white trash left for dead in a ditch, takes her in, and then sets about stripping the scantily clad young nymph of her evil ways. L'il ball 'n' chain disciplinin' never hurt any slut, even one who's got a wicked fever and been beaten bloody. Lazarus actually turns out to be a real gentleman, drawin' baths and singin' lullabies and such, although Brewer can't resist taking advantage of Rae in her weakened condition by giving her rape nightmares, which are made to look just a smidge like pay-cable porn, the camera sliding down the poor nymph's leg while she tosses and turns. Unconscious, this girl's still gotta have it.
As even Esquire 's hot and bothered critic couldn't fail to notice, Brewer is upstanding enough to pay for his sins. Beginning with a bangJustin Timberlake 's soon-to-ship-out National Guardsman bumpin' and grindin' atop his half-loyal girlfriend RaeBlack Snake Moan  finds God around the bend, with Jackson's perverse holy man once again drawing his pulp fiction straight outta the good book. For Lazarus (or Brewer), scrubbing this bad girl's soul means not subjecting her to slavery so much as getting her to work in the kitchen, to sing "This Little Light of Mine" (no kidding), to appreciate a talking blues sermon about the hellfire horrors of abortion. Lord willing, our hero can break this wild mare: Call him the Ho Whisperer .
Second rule of exploitation: For God's sake, don't be boring. Alas, after his camera has had its fill of ogling Rae, Brewer turns out to have nothing up his sleeve, nothing in his pants, only a little on his mind and none of it, amazingly, to do with race. Whatever provocation helps sell the movieincluding Timberlake's knee-jerk turn as a panic-attacked gruntdoesn't give Black Snake Moan  the slightest hint of substance, which is maybe the real reason it got the green light. Both times I saw the film (like Rae, I'm a glutton for punishment), male buddies in the theater turned to one another with knowing smirkslike, Holy moly, now ain't this one a l'il vixen? Maybe these guys had lost their . . . uh, full attention by the time Brewer contrives to get Rae all gussied up and ready to shake her thing down the aisle. But by then, I might reckon the good ol' boys got what they came for.
