 “War/Dance,” a visually ravishing documentary that follows a group of schoolchildren from a refugee camp in northern Uganda to a national music competition, raises a fundamental issue for filmmakers confronting unimaginable suffering in war-torn African countries. To what degree should human savagery be softened, sweetened and presented in a spirit of hope to make it palatable to a movie audience?  Directed by Sean Fine and Andrea Nix Fine, this would-be crowd pleaser, which won the documentary directing prize at this year’s Sundance Film Festival, is so gorgeous that its beauty distracts from the anguish it reveals.  Atrocities are not shown,  only recalled in the quiet voices of children who witnessed them, and in some cases committed them under duress.  Every shot in “War/Dance,” much of which was filmed in the Patongo refugee camp in northern Uganda, has the polish of a richly hued, impeccably composed illustration. You wonder why the filmmakers felt obliged to shoehorn so many pretty sunsets into  the film,  which appears to be admiring itself in a mirror.  When individual children, some in tears, tell their stories while gazing directly into the camera, the shots seem posed and their remarks possibly rehearsed.  The production notes explain that the children felt more comfortable telling their stories directly to the camera than to an interviewer, but you still have an uneasy sense of being manipulated.  One scene follows a mother and her young daughter as they visit the makeshift grave of the girl’s murdered father. As  the girl breaks down and sobs, and her sad but dry-eyed mother urges her to be strong, you begin to wonder if the scene is a studious re-enactment.  Having voiced these qualms, let me say that “War/Dance,” in spite of its slickness, is an honorable, sometimes inspiring exploration of the primal healing power of music and dance in an African tribal culture. The competition in the capital city,  Kampala, is obviously much more than an entertaining talent show. Through music, dance and drumming, the children transmute fear and pain into profoundly cathartic spiritual affirmation.  These ancestral dances are connected to  their homeland and their tribal roots (they are members of the Acholi tribe) and ultimately to their core identity. When they perform the Bwola, the tribe’s intricate, 500-year-old royal dance, you feel its ritual power healing broken lives.  The children are victims of a 20-year civil war that has cost tens of thousands of lives in northern Uganda  which the movie, to its detriment, barely mentions and about which it supplies no historical background. Many were abducted from their villages in the middle of the night by the Lord’s Resistance Army, a rebel group that turned kidnapped boys as young as 5 into soldiers and girls into sexual slaves. Many were snatched in front of their parents, and some were forced at gunpoint to beat and kill family members and neighbors.  The movie focuses on three children from the Patongo camp who make the long journey to Kampala in 2005  in trucks guarded by security forces: Rose, a 13-year-old choir singer who witnessed her parents’ murder by the rebels; Nancy, a 14-year-old dancer who took charge of her three younger siblings after her father’s killing  and her mother’s abduction;  and Dominic, a 14-year-old former child soldier in the Lord’s Resistance Army, whose passion is playing the xylophone.  It is the first time that children from the Patongo camp have qualified for the competition, in which more than 20,000 Ugandan schools compete, and expectations of their success are low. In the refugee camp 60,000 people live in squalid, cramped quarters without electricity or running water, and many suffer from malnutrition and disease. Because they come from a war-torn area where resources are scarce, they are looked down on by their southern rivals, who know that many were forced by the Lord’s Resistance Army to commit atrocities.  Once the children reach Kampala, “War/Dance” focuses on the contest, which includes some stirring performances in an atmosphere of high excitement. The film draws out the suspense as best it can until the inevitable African-style “American Idol” moment. If that finale is genuinely exhilarating, you are still uncomfortably aware that this ecstatic conclusion doesn’t mean the end of the strife  or the refugees’ troubles. It is a blip of light on a dark canvas.  “War/Dance” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some thematic material involving descriptions of war atrocities.

Spellbound" with orphans, "War Dance" has a foot in two movie camps: One is the sadly unceasing number of stories about African tragedy, the other the unstoppable parade of films about kids (or virtual kids) competing in spelling bees/Scrabble/crossword puzzle/dance contests. If this seems incongruous, it is: The young black faces are too beautiful, the landscapes too pretty, and the personal stories of slaughter too scripted. While the pic may be targeting Westerners who want to feel less awful about genocide and global negligence, it's hard to imagine "War Dance" appealing to that crowd -- or any other.
Well-intentioned but a victim of its own high cinematic values, "War Dance" addresses the issues of unending war in northern Uganda, where students at the Patongo Primary School in the Patongo refugee camp are to compete in a nationwide music contest. Three students are the focus of directors Sean and Andrea Nix Fine: Rose, a singer, Dominic, a xylophone player, and Nancy, a dancer, all of whom relate stories of unspeakable brutality and murder (Dominic himself was child soldier). They are framed similarly, with a slow focus in and a recriminating stare at the camera. The formal devices of the film, and the lack of spontaneity in the children's words, do little to sell the message of the movie.
In between the kids' profiles, we see the school preparing for the competition, which involves native music and dance. No one expects the Patongo children to win, or even perform competitively, which exacerbates one of the problems with "War Dance." We're given very little perspective on what the competition is, how well Patongo has to perform to win or what the students' odds really are. The conclusion auds will leap to is that Patongo is going to do very well. Why else would we be here? 
"War Dance" provides a service, perhaps, by making the issues of African warfare more presentable to a wider audience -- more palatable, by connecting it to the ultimately hopeful stories of Rose, Dominic and Nancy. They represent children all over the world who have been orphaned, violated or forced to carry arms. But the people who need such matters sugar-coated aren't going to see "War Dance" anyway. And those do will find the experience an affront.

In a just world, Sean Fine  and Andrea Nix 's documentary wouldn't exist at least not in this fashion. The rebel group known as the Lord's Resistance Army  would not have been free to ravage northern Uganda , butchering parents, raping and killing children, and displacing entire towns of civilians; failing that, at the very least there would be no alarm needed to alert the rest of the world to the atrocitiesamong them the conversion of kidnapped children into forced killers. But in the existing marketplace, entertainment, not social consciousness, is the currencyhence this wake-up call couched in a strenuously upbeat inspirational sports doc.
The sport is Uganda's national music and dance competition; the underdog heroes are Dominic, Rose, and Nancy, three orphaned teens in the Patongo refugee camp, whose school troupe is the first to represent rough-and-tumble northern Uganda against the more cosmopolitan south. They tell their horrific stories of mutilation and murder directly to the camera, while the reliance on picturesque backdrops, high-energy performances, and countdown-to-the-big-show narrative gambits begs you not to watch something easier on the conscience. The movie comes across as desperately, even irritatingly contrived, but I'd be lying if I didn't say it overcame my naturally complacent instinctswhich would be to watch something (anything ) else, to not get haunted by that closing litany of websites for global action.
