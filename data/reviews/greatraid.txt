War may indeed be hell, but for those on the home front these days this combatively boring misfire from the once promising director John Dahl (Red Rock West
, The Last Seduction
) plays like some mad information extraction exercise at Abu Ghraib if it were staffed by local cineplex popcorn drones-turned-black-ops baddies. Like the infamous Japanese water tortures of WWII, Dahl�s film is a steadily mounting series of pesky nonevents paced with all the frenetic, action-packed verve of a wounded lawn sprinkler. Never mind that the story of The Great Raid
 � which purports to tell the tale of the single largest rescue mission of WWII, during which some 500 American POWs, imprisoned in a hellish Japanese labor camp in the Philippines after the fall of Bataan, and more or less written off as acceptable losses by the Washington hawks � is riveting real-life wartime history at its finest. Onscreen, however, Dahl and writers Carlo Bernard and Doug Miro have instead crafted what may well be the single dullest war film of the past decade, if not longer. Despite the obvious and surely intentional title similarities, this is a far cry from John Sturges� The Great Escape
; in place of the supercool cocksurity of Steve McQueen we get Benjamin Bratt as the Ranger Lt. Colonel tagged to head up the mission. For some reason, Bratt equates the constant puffing out of his not-inconsiderable chest with rough-and-tumble leadership, which makes him look, on the contrary, more like a swaggering gamecock strutting around a blood-soaked barnyard in search of something to peck at. On the other side of the razorwire are the American prisoners, bedraggled, suffering from malaria, and wondering � not without just cause � if their leaders have forgotten their plight. As General MacArthur makes good on his promise to return to the Philippines, corncob pipe, aviator shades and all, the prisoners� plight grows increasingly desperate. Major Gibson (Fiennes), the nominal heart and soul of the story, suffers not only from a ghastly bout of malaria but also an entirely unnecessary subplot involving the girl he left behind: the unflappable nurse and resistance fighter Margaret Utinsky (Nielsen), who repeatedly risks her life to provide the beleaguered POWs with black-market quinine to stave off the shuddery malarial sweats that threaten to wipe them out before the Japanese can execute them. There are the makings of a fine, moving, epic war film here, but thanks to the inclusion of enough chatty exposition to sink the Bismarck
, again, and some just plain silly casting choices (Bratt and Nielsen, in particular, seem to have wandered in from some other, worse, picture), The Great Raid
 is anything but. It slogs along from forward command post to jungle crawl and, ultimately, liberation, without so much as a single memorably gung-ho, crowd-pleasing battle sequence. On the other hand, we do get Joseph Fiennes doing some method malarial acting, which, let�s face it, isn�t all that great either.


Fans of seedy little noir movies might remember John Dahl's name. He made that mischievous Nicolas Cage number, ''Red Rock West," and ''The Last Seduction," a first-rate double-cross thriller with Linda Fiorentino, the tough, sexy actress who was born 50 years too late for the major career she deserved.
So, perhaps, was Dahl. In those movies from the early '90s, and even in the undercooked gambling picture ''Rounders" and 2001's underrated road-trip nightmare, ''Joy Ride," Dahl demonstrated a sly, classical style. He'd get a story and stick menacingly to it.
Dahl's career never took off, in part because he lacked the ambition of a Steven Soderbergh, who used his seedy little noirs to become the sort of director who conquers the movie business with glossy variations on the real thing. But Dahl hasn't given up. His new movie, ''The Great Raid," recounts a little-remembered chapter of World War II in which a band of Army soldiers rescued 500 American prisoners of war from Japanese camps in the Philippines.
It's not a noir, and while the story allows Dahl to build a number of scenes with hard-nosed rigor, ''The Great Raid" has a terrible time hanging together. The film splits its two hours among the starving, malaria-stricken prisoners, their military saviors, and the medical guardians who risk their lives to sneak quinine to the sickly soldiers.
At the camp, Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes) tries to keep his men's spirits up, even as he lies on a cot queasy with malaria, wondering about his lady love, the American nurse, played by the gorgeous Scandinavian skyscraper Connie Nielsen. She's spearheading the covert quinine delivery in Manila. The Japanese are brutal. Naturally, the men thirst for escape.
Meanwhile, the soldiers who've embarked to find their comrades are a stock assortment of dutiful -- OK, bland -- heroes, commanded by Benjamin Bratt, an actor who seems incapable of living up to the promise of his matinee-idol face. But none of the cast is given much opportunity to act. James Franco, an actor who can be dangerously coiled, just seems to be spitting out lines. Fiennes doesn't register entirely. And in her scenes with the Filipino and Japanese actors, Nielsen suggests, briefly, a pulpier, campier wartime melodrama that the movie is too dutiful to indulge.
A lot of the trouble is that the movie has been adapted from two different books on the subject, ''The Great Raid on Cabanatuan" by William B. Breuer and ''Ghost Soldiers" by Hampton Sides, and its screenwriters and editor haven't bothered to weave a harmonious narrative from them. They've also failed to make the Filipino and the Japanese characters more than their nationalities.
The cast and crew are mere passengers in history's sidecar, anyway. The most moving moments come with the archival footage of the actual soldiers and their homecoming that plays over the closing credits.
On screen, at least, the raid to free the prisoners isn't all that great -- just a bunch of explosions and combat maneuvers. Still, it's the one sequence in the film where everybody works with the same conviction. The audience, meanwhile, has to sit around with the prisoners, waiting for this to happen. It's a long wait.
Ulimately, the requirements of a war picture don't play to Dahl's strengths. There are shady characters on screen, but because the movie is ultimately meant as a work of valor, there's no occasion for the director to revel in mischief. Good and bad are labeled with blatant economy, like canned goods on a supermarket shelf.
''The Great Raid" amounts to a noble failure. This is sad news for those of us who remain hopelessly partial to Dahl's mean streak. The failure we can live with. It's the noble part that will never do.


         John Dahl's World War II saga "The Great Raid" begins with a lengthy, painstaking preamble to a lengthy, painstaking reenactment of the raid on Cabanatuan. Rings no bells? Not to worry. Based on two books, "The Great Raid on Cabanatuan" by William B. Breuer and "Ghost Soldiers" by Hampton Sides, the movie will dutifully spackle over every last gap in your education and even allow for dry time.
 
  Meanwhile, the hand of the guy who directed such dexterous neo-noirs as "Red Rock West" and "The Last Seduction" is nowhere in evidence. A plodding, squeaky-straight Time-Life tribute to the greatest generation, the movie plays like a commemorative plaque. When Capt. Prince (James Franco) remarks early on that the 6th Ranger Battalion, which eventually carries out the rescue, is "exceptionally well-trained but has seen little action," you'll come to understand exactly what he means.
 


         






    The setup begins shortly after Pearl Harbor, when Japan's attack on the Philippines resulted in "the largest single defeat in the history of the American military" and the capture of 60,000 U.S. troops. Those who survived the Bataan death march were herded into Japanese prison camps, where they faced certain death.
 
  The story begins three years later (about as long, incidentally, as "The Great Raid" moldered on Miramax's shelves), when Col. Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) decides to stage a rescue mission that has no strategic value to the war. This fact is reiterated to the point of counterproductiveness, making him seem as though he sees "The Great Raid" more like The Big Favor. Mucci puts Capt. Prince in charge of planning so he may focus on stalking around commandingly, reeking of Clark Gable.
 
  Divided three ways among the rangers, the prisoners and the resistance fighters in Manila, the movie feels unfocused, schematic and overpopulated. Among the captured is Maj. Gibson (Joseph Fiennes), who, ill with malaria, spends most of the movie supine, sweating and shivering. In his spare time, he pines chastely for Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen), the beautiful widow of his commanding officer and the head of the resistance movement, who nobly pines back while smuggling quinine into the camp in the face of unspeakable danger.
 
  Actually, that's not true. The danger is speakable. There is very little in "The Great Raid" that isn't explained in great depth. For roughly 45 minutes, characters manfully mumble shop — outlining strategy, reiterating concerns and fretting over Japanese plans for prisoner annihilation against great symphonic swells. By the time the climax approaches, it hits you that you barely know who any of these soldiers are. Apart from Capt. Redding (Marton Csokas), Gibson's rebel jokester friend, the prisoners and soldiers are called upon to do little more than look heroic, stoic and more or less Paleozoic when compared with characters in war-themed movies filmed after the late 1960s. Cinematographer Peter Menzies Jr. bleeds the color out of the footage, making it look like lightly colorized black-and-white. It's a pretty effect, and fittingly old-fashioned for a movie uninterested in gray areas or the messy business of character.

War often presents us with horrible choices: Fall asleep in the theater or fall asleep to the History Channel? That's the question posed by The Great Raid , a WWII movie so parched, so Reader's Digest  expository, so utterly expressionless, it confuses taciturn Greatest Generation nobility with paralysis. Raid , conceived in the wake of Sept. 11 and shelved for two years, looks like a historical reenactment staged by animatronic Boy Scouts. It's the true tale of a daring mission to retrieve U.S. prisoners of war from a Japanese death camp in the Philippines, but director John Dahl, in his pacing, seems more intent on evoking the Bataan Death March. How did the nimble indie moralist of Red Rock West find himself in this quagmire? Raid , arcing brass fanfares aside, is no kin to Saving Private Ryan , or even The Big Red One . No, Dahl has decolorized The Green Berets .
The main problem? Raid  lacks a center. It's an exhausted sprawl with multiple story foci, none of them terribly compelling. There's the rescue unit of Army Rangers, headed by stolid Lieut. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) and equally stolid Capt. Robert Prince (James Franco, whose main duty is to overwhelm the enemy with voice-over). They're attempting something brazen, but unless you're a military historian, you'd never guess. There are the POWs, headed by stolid, malarial Major Gibson (the dependably cadaverous Joseph Fiennes). And there's Margaret (Gladiator 's Connie Nielsen), the stolid nurse Gibson loves from afar, who's running the resistance in Manila. Stolidly. Dahl chisels not a sliver of nuance from all this wood. The Japanese are mere villains, so don't hold your breath for a Colonel Saito. But Dahl does vividly re-create that least heralded burden of war: the boredom.

 About the only thing to be said on behalf of "The Great Raid," a tedious World War II epic that slogs across the screen like a forced march in quicksand, is that it illustrates a depressing similarity between reckless war-mongering and grandiose moviemaking. Historical films with vainglorious ambitions, like ill-fated imperial ventures, often overlook the human factor, a miscalculation that usually results in a rout.  This 132-minute Miramax film, completed two years ago and dumped into the marketplace during the dog days of August, reputedly cost $80 million. Not since Ted Turner's stillborn boondoggle "Gods and Generals" has a war film squandered so much on such emptiness.  A sense of futility is the last thing "The Great Raid" would like to convey. The film, based on true events, aspires to the heroic dimensions of "Saving Private Ryan" and "The Bridge on the River Kwai." The story meticulously re-enacts the against-all-odds liberation of 500 American prisoners of war from the heavily guarded Japanese camp at Cabanatuan, in the Philippines, by a band of untested American soldiers in January 1945.  Those American prisoners were survivors of the notorious Bataan Death March, in which 70,000 Allied troops who had surrendered to the Japanese Imperial Army at Bataan in 1942 were forced to embark on a nightmarish 63-mile trek through the jungle; thousands died. Dispatched to various Japanese camps, many of the remaining soldiers were starved and some burned alive by their captors.  With its radically desaturated color, which drapes everything in hues of mud and dust, "The Great Raid" flaunts a visual stylization of the gritty look of 1940's black-and-white war films. Its scenes of torture and murder also unapologetically revive the uncomfortable stereotype of the Japanese soldier as a sadistic, slant-eyed fiend.  The story is narrated by Capt. Robert Prince (James Franco), who led a hand-picked force of more than 100 deep into enemy territory. Assisting the Americans are members of the Filipino resistance, led by Capt. Juan Pajota (Cesar Montano), whose familiarity with the terrain was critical to the raid's success. Overseeing the plan, Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) views the raid as an opportunity to erase the shame of the American defeat at Bataan, although he concedes that it is not essential to the war effort.  The film's problems begin with the mismatch of its story, based on two books - the historian William B. Breuer's "Great Raid on Cabanatuan" and "Ghost Soldiers" by Hampton Sides - and its director, John Dahl. Assigning a filmmaker known for turning out cynical noirish melodramas like "The Last Seduction" and "Red Rock West" to supervise the re-enactment of a heroic, little-known chapter of World War II is a little like asking John Waters to be Steven Spielberg.  Mr. Dahl, to put it kindly, has no inner John Wayne or Tom Hanks to call upon for inspiration and no larger-than-life vision of war as a glorious adventure or hell on earth. The first-time screenwriters Carlo Bernard and Doug Miro are so busy piecing together the movie's three interlocking stories that they forget to create characters who amount to more than gung-ho boilerplate or the aforementioned fiends.  One strand of the story follows the raid and its preparations. Another, set in the prison camp, focuses on Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes), a malaria-stricken officer. The third, poorly integrated into the movie, follows Major Gibson's sweetheart, Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen), a Lithuanian-born nurse, war widow and heroic real-life leader of the resistance movement in Manila who smuggles medicine into the camp.  It is not the actors' fault that their characters fail to establish any emotional connection; they aren't given the words for the task. Mr. Bratt's officer suggests a shallow, snippy recycling of Detective Rey Curtis, his character on "Law & Order," and Mr. Franco's a blander recycling of the 8-by-10 glossy portrait of James Dean he introduced four years ago in a television docudrama.  When Ms. Nielsen is first seen, you may sigh with relief at the prospect of some warmth. Just a hint of Ingrid Bergman in "Casablanca" might have done wonders for the movie. But all this fascinating Danish actress is allowed to do is appear by turns stoic, imperious and enigmatic.  The actual raid, when it finally happens in the movie's last 40 minutes, provides no visceral release; the prolonged, soggy fireworks display is devoid of suspense, excitement or human drama. The movie's fizzle is cruelly set in relief by the vintage newsreel of the actual raiders that concludes the movie; here, for a moment, is some human feeling.  "The Great Raid" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of violence, including torture, and strong language.

The daring 1944 rescue of 511 U.S. POWs from a notorious Japanese prison camp in the Philippines proved to be a golden opportunity to assuage the shame of the previous surrender. "The Great Raid," on the other hand, reps a lost opportunity to dramatize that WWII rescue. Pic joins recent leaden and literal-minded American war movies, including "Gods and Generals," "The Alamo" and "The Patriot," which fail to make history pulse with vitality. This overlong march will bore all but the most nobly patriotic of auds, making a quick retreat to vid bivouacs, where its mildly epic feel will be lost.
Lensed nearly three years ago but delayed by Miramax, which is releasing it now as part of a last-minute rush of pics being released before the official exit of Bob and Harvey Weinstein, project is a classic example of talented people given the wrong assignments.
Problem starts with noir specialist John Dahl as helmer. Here, Dahl is forced to put aside everything he's good at -- compact storytelling, portentous Western settings, nefarious characters -- in favor of managing a bloated and studied imitation of better prison camp films, from "The Bridge on the River Kwai" to "The Great Escape."
Similarly out of their element are leads Benjamin Bratt, James Franco and Joseph Fiennes, who never manage to viscerally connect with their characters' dilemmas or strengths. Several artistic contributors -- from first-time screenwriters Carlo Bernard and Doug Miro to production designer Bruno Rubeo and composer Trevor Rabin (whose music almost never stops during the slow 132 minute running time) -- appear to have created what they believe a WWII Pacific movie should look and sound like, but without ever managing to make it feel real.
A factoid approach defines the History Channel-style intro, narrated by Franco's Captain Prince and filled with black-and-white documentary footage of the start of the Pacific war from Pearl Harbor to the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, the U.S. retreat and the surrender of more than 70,000 Allied troops who ended up in brutal prison camps and the infamous Bataan death march.
By August 1944, tide of the war had turned, and the Allies were back in the Philippines beating back the Japanese. Hollywood depictions of this less-appreciated front of WWII are so uncommon that younger auds who slept through history class may be stunned to see Japanese soldiers depicted here as murderous thugs, bent on killing all prisoners before the inevitable final battle with the Allies.
Bernard and Miro's script plods from the start as it carefully introduces Prince and his macho commanding officer Lt. Colonel Mucci (Bratt), prisoners at the Japanese-controlled Cabanatuan prison camp led by Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes), and the clandestine civilian underground in Manila embodied by gutsy nurse Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen).
Mucci has convinced top brass to sign off on an extremely risky rescue mission to extract the surviving 511 Cabanatuan prisoners. His unit of Army Rangers and Alamo Scouts has seen no action, and the untested fighters show no fear here. Similarly, although Fiennes looks worn as the ever-ailing Gibson, the suffering of the prisoners is presented with strangely little emotional effect.
A bit more tension is created on the Manila streets, where Utinsky manages to smuggle medicines to the POWs. In one scene, where Utinsky narrowly escapes a setup during a smuggling operation, Dahl finally seems in his element as he cranks up some suspense among double-dealers. But her subsequent arrest and torture by cigarette-twirling Japanese agents has all the credibility of a Charlie Chan episode, further undermining the film's over-determination to be historically accurate to a fault.
Pic mechanically cross-cuts among these three settings, involving mild mini-dramas including Prince's slightly testy relationship with Mucci, Gibson's uncontrollable second-in-charge Captain Redding (Marton Csokas) and Utinsky's loyal but ill-fated Filipino friend Mina (Natalie Mendoza).
Consuming even more time but hardly sending the film in new, fascinating directions are a number of side stories. Until the raid actually begins in earnest at the 88-minute mark, it's fair to wonder if the rescue is ever going to happen at all.
Unlike the tension that permeates the uphill mountain assaults in Terrence Malick's "The Thin Red Line" or the wrenching suspense leading to the blowing of the bridge in "Kwai," this raid on Cabanatuan is as dull as it is historically precise.
Bratt tapped into the blood flow of playwright Miguel Pinero for his scary portrait in "Pinero," but here he seems removed from Mucci and too brooding to be a leader who can stir men. Prince's strategic intelligence is only hinted at by Franco in yet another far-from-convincing perf by this still-developing actor.
Fiennes adopts what's now become his patented 100-yard stare for times when the script fails him. Thesps in costume designer Lizzy Gardiner's good civilian garb, such as Nielsen and Mendoza, ironically come across as more believable and gutsier, while Montano creditably holds up the Filipino side of the battle.
All too telling about the film's failure to connect at the most basic levels is how the concluding reel of archival footage of the rescue carries infinitely greater dramatic power than the preceding two hours-plus.
In a production package that's solid but uninspired, the desaturated color lensing by Peter Menzies Jr. (with father Peter managing significant second unit camerawork) is a bit too overdone, resulting in a bland look.

This dour, retrogressive WW II potboiler asks us to forget the last half-century of political and cultural tumultto say nothing of combat movie tropesin order to feel peachy about war again. Wearing its "based on a true story" imprimatur on its sleeve, the film follows a U.S. Army  squadron on a mission in the Philippines to spring doomed Yanks from a Japanese P.O.W. camp. John Dahl  is too careful a director to make this stuff dull: His methodical approach serves the movie's thesis that group efforts, not individual heroics, win battles, and the titular raid is a real showstopper. But Philippines  B-movie luminary Eddie Romero  wrung greater complexity from similar material 40 years ago, and his movies never trafficked in risible Japanese stereotypes or ultra-expendable Filipino bit players. The Great Raid  is ultimately scotched by History Channel worthy nostalgia. It fails to capture the timely insouciance of, say, The Dirty Dozen  or Kelly's Heroes , war zone capers that dared to posit modern warfare as a playground for looters, homicidal maniacs, and morally vacant careerists. By comparison, Dahl's film oozes Bush-era artistic timidity.
