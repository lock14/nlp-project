 The turbulent reality of young love is something most of us would probably prefer not to remember too clearly. It’s easier to graze vicariously on movie fantasies of shapely young bodies swooning in rapturous lip-locks than to dwell on uncomfortable memories of needy, unformed adults in erotic collision.  Ethan Hawke’s earnest, talky film “The Hottest State,” which he adapted from his own semi-autobiographical 1997 novel, doggedly peels away the gloss to dive into the emotional swamp where two young people get lost in each other. As it follows the coupling and uncoupling of William Harding (Mark Webber), an aspiring young actor from Texas, and Sara Garcia (the Colombian actress Catalina Sandino Moreno), a Latina pop singer from Connecticut who lives in downtown Manhattan, you feel their growing pains much more acutely than their fleeting happiness.  Nearly two hours long, with a tenuous narrative continuity, “The Hottest State,” whose title refers both to passion and to Texas, is far more coherent than Mr. Hawke’s 2001 directorial debut, “Chelsea Walls.” At around the halfway point, however, its characters’ haranguing voices begin to grate on you. People in their early 20s, even pretty people, lose their appeal when they dwell this obsessively on their own inchoate turmoil.  Sara’s frequent insistence that she is not as interesting as William imagines is sadly accurate. A singer with a strong physical resemblance to Norah Jones (Ms. Jones is heard on the soundtrack, composed by Jesse Harris, who has written hits for her), Sara might be described as a drip. Although attractive enough, she exhibits little of the dignity and determination of Ms. Moreno’s title character in “Maria Full of Grace,” and the actress’s lingering discomfort with the English language doesn’t help matters. (In the novel her character was an American from Seattle.) The issue bedeviling Sara is whether to surrender herself to a consuming relationship or resist; she makes the sensible decision to back off.  If William is an even bigger handful than the ambivalent Sara, Mr. Webber’s emotionally risky, wide-open performance makes this infinitely self-dramatizing youth considerably more charming. Not long after he and Sara meet, they spend six days in Mexico, where he is about to appear in a film of Tennessee Williams’s “Camino Real.” Following this de facto honeymoon, during which they briefly contemplate marriage, Sara returns to New York. When he comes back after finishing the movie, he discovers that in his absence she has decided she doesn’t want a boyfriend.  Unwilling to accept her withdrawal, William turns into a stalker who delivers soliloquies from “Romeo and Juliet” under her apartment window and compulsively harasses her on the telephone. For any rejected lover who has succumbed to such desperation, these scenes are excruciatingly real, and Mr. Hawke deserves credit for exploring a place visited by many more men than would care to admit it.  “The Hottest State” also feels dated. William and Sara are a lot more like ’60s bohemians playing grown-up in downtown Manhattan than the sleek serial daters on MTV game shows pursuing hot-  and cold-blooded hookups. One of the most original things about the film is its recognition that there are many different ages of young love. What seems like a half a lifetime can separate being 21 from being 27.  The movie, viewed entirely through William’s eyes, awkwardly throws in some family psychology. His distant, macho father from Fort Worth is a stoic noncommunicator who might have dropped out of a Sam Shepard drama and is played by Mr. Hawke as though he were impersonating Mr. Shepard. William’s embittered mother, Jesse (Laura Linney), hammers him with the kind of hardheaded advice no fervent romantic wants to hear. People aren’t going to love you back and you’re going to die anyway, so get over yourself, she tells him.  When you’re 21 and madly in love, words like that fall on deaf ears.  “The Hottest State” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has intense sexual situations and strong language. 

Adapted by actor-helmer Ethan Hawke from his own novel of the same name, "The Hottest State" takes a good deal of time to heat up and fails to generate much more than a lukewarm empathy for its petulant main characters. Follow-up to Hawke's feature helming debut, "Chelsea Walls," accompanies a Gotham-based young actor down the road to heartbreak when he's dumped by his singer g.f. Patchy lead perfs and mannered helming subtract value from pic's tangible plus points (solid supporting turns, pleasant score). Mixed reception on Venice's Lido forecasts mild to cool B.O. weather in most states.
Core story centers round relationship between 20-year-old aspiring thesp William Harding (Mark Webber, a support in "Broken Flowers") and wannabe thrush Sara Garcia (Catalina Sandino Moreno, star of "Maria Full of Grace"), who's just arrived in New York City. The two meet in a downtown bar, and within days she's moving into his apartment (which is infeasibly large for someone with supposedly little coin).
After a prickly meeting with her mother (Sonia Braga, in tastily tart form), they head off for a weeklong bed session in Mexico City, where they nearly get married. Post-vacation, it's all downhill once Sara decides she'd rather not have a boyfriend at all.
Dialogue in early scenes of love's young dream has a semi-improvised feel, for example when William and Sara play-act out, prophetically as it happens, how they will split up. Tone is reminiscent of Hawke's own sweet duets with Julie Delpy in "Before Sunrise" and "Before Sunset," which Richard Linklater (who has a small cameo here) helmed, only the perfs here feel stiffer and more self-conscious.
The effect may have been intentional, but suspicions remain that Moreno in particular is floundering with a character who never amounts to more than a few rough facets: She's a Latina, from a wealthy Connecticut background, has been hurt by a bad breakup, and is supposedly "smart," although her intelligence is more insisted on than demonstrated.
Webber fares better and shows a genuine flare for comedy in a wince-inducing scene where his character repeatedly calls Sara's answering machine to leave progressively more desperate and rambling messages.
In press notes for pic, helmer Hawke hints at autobiographical parallels between himself and William. Like Hawke, William hails from Texas, the hottest state of the title, which is the setting for an opening flashback showing how William's parents, Vince and Jesse (played as teens by Daniel Ross and Anne Clarke), first met.
The relevance of this just glimpsed backstory only gradually becomes clear near the pic's end, as the writer-helmer strains to make his big point, which feels like a therapy-learned life lesson: that William's abandonment by his father when he was 8 contributed to his later obsessive behavior.
Climactic scene in which William confronts his dad (played now as an adult by Hawke) scrapes together genuine poignancy in an otherwise skittishly shot sequence. Second hour of pic reps the stronger half by some stretch, with good work contributed from Laura Linney as William's acerbic, frustrated mother and from Michelle Williams, vivid and all-too briefly seen, as one of William's ex-lovers.
Pushing hard to achieve some kind of lyricism the plot itself doesn't ever quite muster, Hawke pulls assorted tricks out of the box, including slo-mo sequences and generally stylized camerawork courtesy of d.p. Christopher Norr, abrupt flashbacks and too much voiceover work. When Hawke relaxes and gets his thesps in a comfortable place, pic flares brightly into life, but the judders may be too frequent to generate strong word of mouth.
Work by tech departments leaves something to be desired. Lensing, by accident or misconceived design, is often underlit, and noise mix on print caught sounded muddy, with key lines of dialogue occasionally drowned out by Jesse Harris' pervasive, but nevertheless tuneful and jaunty, jazz-inflected score.

After the deathly dull, faux-hipster muddle that was Ethan Hawke 's directorial debut, Chelsea Walls  , expectations aren't exactly high for the scruffy, pretentious, boho actor's adaptation of his own 1997 novelabout a scruffy, pretentious, boho actor and too-intense Romeo named William (Mark Webber ). But in chronicling the manic euphoria of this 20-year-old's first love and, subsequently, the neurotic despair of his first break-up with aspiring singer-songwriter Sara (Catalina Sandino Moreno ), Hawke quite capably taps into the bittersweet complexities of young, love-struck idiocy (otherwise known as the agonizing path that leads to the romantic realization that boys are dumb, girls are insane, sex isn't everything, and self-destructive obsession is tough to kick). The two meet in a Williamsburg  bar, become inseparable even after she clamps her chastity belt shut, and finally consummate in a sticky, week-long Mexican tryst. After an acting gig keeps him away for a month, Sara passively decides that she's not into boyfriends, and William reacts accordingly: He stalks her. It's achingly sincere, which isn't to say that Hawke's Tennessee Williams quoting, overwrought script isn't as purple as Prince's rain and littered with dramatic shortcuts (both lovers have daddy issues). Give the guy some credit, though: When you hit rock bottom with your first feature, the only way to go is up.
