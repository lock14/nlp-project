You may enjoy ''Dear Wendy" more than you probably ought to, especially if you have a soft spot for Lars Von Trier's sardonic deconstructions of American culture. Taking wobbly aim at our country's complicated love affair with guns, the movie's the very definition of a cheap shot. The young cast convinces you of the characters' screwy ardor, though, and the film is of a piece. ''Dogville" is the better movie, but this one's less hateful, and, oddly enough, I do
 mean that as a recommendation.
Of course, Von Trier hasn't directed ''Dear Wendy" -- Thomas Vinterberg has, from Von Trier's script. Vinterberg made 1998's ''The Celebration," the best of the early Dogme films, and then fell flat on his face with the all-star romantic epic ''It's All About Love." The new film shows the director edging back into good graces, and he certainly has an interest in human beings his screenwriter lacks.
Still, ''Dear Wendy" takes place in Lars-land, an unmoored and unnamed American town that feels equal parts inner city and old West. All the men work in the local mine while, up top, shopkeepers quake in fear of violent teenage gangs that never materialize. Young Dick (Jamie Bell, the scruffy balletomane from ''Billy Elliot") is a self-described loser who one day buys a toy gun as a gag birthday present for a kid he doesn't like; his equally disaffected co-worker Stevie (Mark Webber) takes one look and announces that it's a 6.6 5mm double action revolver. Real, in other words, just like Stevie's prized 1896 pistol, which he has named ''Badsteel."
And so begins a religion, to the strains of glorious old Zombies classics like ''Time of the Season" on the soundtrack. The two boys set up a clubhouse temple in an abandoned mine where they can fire potshots. Stevie handles the hardware while Dick takes on the ideology and the shooting. They call themselves the Dandies and go about gathering recruits, since, as Dick says, ''Pacifists with guns is such a great idea, it's practically our duty to share it with others."
In short order, they've attracted the crippled Huey (Chris Owen), his put-upon little brother (Michael Angarano), and Susan (Alison Pill), a pallid shopkeeper's daughter whose breasts grow along with her newfound self-confidence. The others find themselves transformed, too. ''Suddenly I was one of the people with guns," Dick writes to Wendy in the long and flowery letter that serves as the movie's narrative track.
Who's Wendy? Let's just say she's Dick's true love and leave it at that. ''Dear Wendy" is loaded with ideas, some half-baked, some dead-on, some just stupid, and Vinterberg throws them at the screen willy-nilly. Can you worship an instrument of power without using it? Can a romance with weaponry be anything other than naive? Does a need for self-importance create a need for victims? Thank the filmmakers for asking but don't expect any answers.
The arrival of a new conscript, a hardheaded young gunslinger named Sebastian (Danso Gordon, nicely wary), stirs the Dandies' pot in predictable ways, and the fact that this character is black is meant to be an arrant provocation. Since Von Trier and Vinterberg understand America's racial landscape rather less well than they understand Sanskrit, the gambit fails.
''Dear Wendy" regains its formal footing, though, in a climax that pits the group against the forces of the town sheriff (Bill Pullman) in an absurdist parody of a high-noon shootout with creepy (if unwarranted) echoes of Columbine. There's one further attempt to outrage: the strains of ''The Battle Hymn of the Republic" rising over the carnage a la Bowie's ''Young Americans" over the end credits of ''Dogville." Forgive us if we're merely amused.

         The first surprise in the unpredictable and original "Dear Wendy" is that its young hero, Dick (Jamie Bell), who at the outset of the film starts writing a letter that will serve as voice-over narration, is not addressing a girlfriend but his cherished revolver.
 
  Dick lives in a desolate coal mining town, shot in desaturated hues and likely set in West Virginia, and he feels like a loser until Stevie (Mark Webber), a heretofore near-silent co-worker at a grocery store, informs him that a recently purchased cap pistol is in fact the real thing, a high-quality revolver. The discovery bonds the two teenage loners, and Stevie's vast knowledge of guns infects Dick.
 


         






    In a beginning more intricate and clever than outlined here, two of Denmark's Dogme 95 co-founders — Lars von Trier, who wrote the script, and Thomas Vinterberg, who directed — launch an allegory on guns and violence in America that is all the more resounding for its acutely observed foreigners' perspective.
 
  The entire film was shot in Denmark and Germany, but one would never know it, so astute is the production design, with only one or two props in the entire film not likely to find their way in into a U.S. coal town.
 
  Dick has resisted following his widowed father — who early on drops dead in the midst of an off-screen temper tantrum — into the mines, but the youth has yet to find himself.
 
  But now the escalating obsession with guns and their lore that blossoms within Dick and Stevie leaves them feeling increasingly empowered.
 
  They feel so good about themselves that they decide to spread the word to three other young people who are also regarded as losers by their peers: Susan (Alison Pill), shy daughter of the proprietor of the local dry goods store; and brothers Huey (Chris Owen) and Freddie (Michael Angarano) — Huey has at long last just received a pair of prosthetic legs that free him from his wheelchair.
 
  The group is soon calling itself the Dandies, erecting a "temple" in an abandoned mine building and setting up a shooting range in the mine below. Their mantra is that "guns are bad," but these dedicated pacifists love them all the same.
 
  They steep themselves in gun history, collect old weapons, don costumes redolent of the Old West and the Edwardian era and create a fantasy world with great precision and detail that is at odds with the drabness of their environment. The effect is intoxicating to one and all, and Susan even attributes the longed-for development of her bosom to her being a Dandy.
 
  The Dandies thrive in an underground state of innocence and secrecy while their daily lives thrive with new-found confidence — until the sheriff (Bill Pullman), a twangy lunkhead, insists that Dick, as a model young citizen, serve as an informal probation officer to Sebastian (Danso Gordon), the grandson of Dick's former longtime African American housekeeper Clarabelle (Novella Nelson).
 
  Although Sebastian has, in the words of the sheriff, "blown away somebody," he is apparently still a minor, and the sheriff is feeling lenient toward this ex-con as long as he comes under Dick's positive influence.
 
  Self-confident and cool, Sebastian brings a breath of reality to the Dandies' hermetic existence.
 
  It's clear from frame one that "Dear Wendy" is almost certainly not going to end well, but the complex course it takes, also from the start, cannot be guessed, and by the time this astute and entirely distinctive film is over, the folly of America's love affair with guns, past and present, is laid bare with the same inescapable force with which Gregg Araki exposed the horror of child molestation in "Mysterious Skin," a similarly poetic and deceptively affectless film.

 Thomas Vinterberg, the director of "Dear Wendy," and Lars von Trier, its screenwriter, collaborated previously on the Dogma 95 manifesto, now marking its 10th anniversary, which set out to revitalize cinema by imposing a set of strict and arbitrary rules - a "vow of chastity" - on filmmakers. Mr. Vinterberg went on to direct "The Celebration" (1998), the only Dogma movie made so far with a legitimate claim to greatness. Mr. von Trier has moved on to other provocations, most recently a trilogy, of which two parts ("Dogville" and "Manderlay") have been completed, set in imaginary American small towns.  "Dear Wendy," filmed in Denmark, takes place in an American mining hamlet with the peculiar name Estherslope. Given a harsh, grainy beauty by the cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (whose credits include "Dogville" and Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later"), it is an expectedly bleak and violent place. A miner's son named Dick (Jamie Bell, who was also, curiously enough, a miner's son in "Billy Elliot") gathers a group of disaffected young people into a club called the Dandies. They are pacifists obsessed with handguns, which they collect and fire in an abandoned mine building. They refer to their firearms as their "partners" and give them names. Dick's, a dainty pearl-handled revolver that he initially mistakes for a toy, is called Wendy, and the story is presented as a letter he is writing to her.  At least he can be bothered to write. Mr. von Trier, in contrast, seems to have pulled the script out of his ear (which is not especially attuned to the idioms of American English). Though "Dogville" and "Manderlay" have infuriated some critics for their assumptions about American life and baffled others with their minimal sets and eccentric stage effects, they are nonetheless governed by a rigorous narrative economy. Here, the story is laughably incoherent, which would be less bothersome if the movie were not also so unremittingly pretentious. It gestures in all sorts of allegorical directions, but the only idea you can take away from it is that the Zombies, whose music is featured on the soundtrack, were an underrated band.  Fine. In the meantime, it is painful to watch actors as gifted as Mr. Bell, Mark Webber (who plays Stevie, the Trotsky to Dick's Lenin) and Bill Pullman (as the town sheriff) address themselves so seriously to such a piece of nonsense. And it is disappointing to see filmmakers who have in the past been so aggressively forward-thinking take another step toward intellectual bankruptcy.
Yet more buckshot and spleen launched in America's general direction, Lars von Trier 's screenplay for Dear Wendy  marks the latest volume of his history of violence, though director Thomas Vinterberg following on from his loopy film maudit It's All About Love has a lighter trigger finger than his inflammatory Dogme colleague. Son of a dead miner in a dying coal town, Dick (Jamie Bell ) is a sensitive kid out of place in Estherslope, a dusty burg shakily conjured from von Trier's most weather-beaten tintype fantasiesDogville with decor. Unionizing his fellow misfits, Dick forms the Dandies, a gang of pacifist gun nuts. Bunking in a disused works where the Zombies play forever, the Dandies name and master their firearms and even go so far as to marry these antique "partners" (the epistolary romance implied in the title plays out between Dick and his pearl-handled missus). Especially in the climactic, clumsily staged gunfight, the prevailing mode is wide-eyed idiocywhich might be the point, since von Trier's satirical target is the hypocrisy of (news flash!) America's eagerness to enforce stability and security with all guns blazing. As the current president once put it in a slightly different context, "This war is really about peace."
