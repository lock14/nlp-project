Giovanni Ribisi, with pasty skin and hair slicked back like Dracula's, plays the sort of badass goombah psychopath who smashes a bottle in your face first and asks questions later. The actor seems to be having a good time in 10th & Wolf , but, like everyone around him, he could almost be in a high school theater production of GoodFellas  as staged by Rushmore 's Max Fischer. At least Ribisi's fake-cojones histrionics are fun. The rest of this Donnie Brasco  knockoff, with James Marsden as a Gulf War veteran who goes undercover, is a turgid, ketchup-spattered dud.

 A gangster movie that tries harder, “10th and Wolf” is the directorial debut of Bobby Moresco, a writer and producer of “Crash.” It desperately wants to matter in the same way that its Academy Award-winning forerunner tried to matter: by trafficking in a blunt, populist morality that insists we’re all in this mess together. The mess, in this case, isn’t the stew of simmering ethnic and class antagonisms addressed in “Crash,” but a pervasive feeling that there’s not much difference nowadays between the good guys and the bad; everyone is tainted.  If that message is moldy, “10th and Wolf” gives it a meretricious new twist. Without thinking very hard, it compares America’s exit from the first Persian Gulf war to gangster morality in a shabby neighborhood of an Eastern industrial city. That comparison doesn’t add up, except in the mind of the movie’s putative hero, Tommy Santoro (James Marsden). In a solemn voice-over narration, he analogizes his reaction to the United States withdrawal from the gulf in 1991 to his traumatic disillusionment at age 12, when his father was shot dead on the front lawn. It was then that he realized that his beloved dad was a mobster who probably deserved what he got.  Because the movie, filmed in Pittsburgh, is loosely based on real events that occurred in Philadelphia in the 1980’s and early 90’s, its particular circle of urban hell is an unidentified hybrid of the two cities. Filmed in shades of brown and gray and slathered in blood, its world is as drab and menacing as that of “Donnie Brasco.” In a diabolical touch, mob colloquies take place in a giant meatpacking cellar amid the hanging carcasses.  The movie is narrated by Tommy, its only male character with a glimmer of nobility. (The women are the usual long-suffering, silent partners who know too much and occasionally erupt in hysterical fits.) A handsome, tarnished angel, Tommy, the one member of his family not caught up in a life of crime, returns to his hometown in 1991 after serving as a Marine in the gulf. Initially gung-ho to fight the good fight, he decided that the war made no sense when Saddam Hussein was left in power. Running amok, he stole a jeep, beat up an officer and served time in the brig.  With no clear future in view, he stays with his aunt Tina (Lesley Ann Warren) and exerts a good influence on his dimwitted younger brother, Vincent (a dissipated-looking Brad Renfro). Almost immediately he is accosted by Horvath (Brian Dennehy), a hulking, corrupt F.B.I. agent who threatens to put him in prison for years unless he infiltrates the family business and wears a wire to record negotiations between his cousin Joey (Giovanni Ribisi) and a Mafia drug lord (Francesco Salvi) moving in on family territory.    Because “10th and Wolf” is set in gangland, it falls back on mob family values to provide whatever sympathy it can scrounge up for its lowlifes. The movie is full of the usual scenes of hugging, grieving and vowing of loyalty that signal that these people have feelings too: operatic ones.  But the characters never transcend the clichés embedded in the culture since “The Godfather.” Except for Tommy, who doesn’t seem to belong to the family, the men are raging, foul-mouthed beasts who exact revenge with the sadistic relish that Brian De Palma’s “Scarface” made into a mob movie imperative. Early on, a one-legged sociopath (Dash Mihok) bludgeons another man to a pulp with his prosthesis. If you can’t technically fault the hot-wired performance of Mr. Ribisi as a rising mob boss, his character amounts to little more than a reheated Joe Pesci-Harvey Keitel stereotype.  For efficiency’s sake, the screenplay crams all the information about its characters’ backgrounds and the neighborhood history into its first 20 minutes. As the consequences of this rushed introduction play out, you are at a loss to recall the details shoehorned into that gory lump of exposition.  Amid all the violence, a half-baked love story wobbles into view,  as Tommy connects with Brandy (Piper Perabo), a beautiful, embittered bartender in the seedy stripper club run by her husband’s killer, Willie (Ken Garito). She and Willy coexist warily until a showdown on top of the bar that begins as an attempted rape and explodes into ultraviolence.  Forget the movie’s spurious moral agenda; scenes like this quasi-pornographic set piece show what trying harder really means in the gangster movie business.  “10th and Wolf” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It is packed with profanity, violence and gore.

"Crash" co-scripter Robert Moresco makes his helming bow in "10th & Wolf," a lackluster actioner about a Marine turned reluctant informant to save his Mafia-implicated family. Very loosely based on the true story of Joseph Pistone, the real "Donnie Brasco," pic throws together gangster archetypes and set pieces, relying heavily on exposition to stand in for character development. When no longer tied to a hot-button topic like racism, Moresco's one-dimensional dramatis personae
 and pedestrian storytelling founder. Opening in a few cities on Aug. 18, wider release seems iffy despite name cast.
In the sand dunes of Kuwait toward the end of the first Gulf War, Tommy Santoro (James Marsden), who feels betrayed by his government's decision not to pursue Saddam Hussein, beats up an officer and goes AWOL. 
Tommy's sentence is commuted thanks to help from FBI agent Horvath (Brian Dennehy). Tommy agrees to cooperate with Horvath, but not because his probable court-martial is commuted. Tommy is swayed instead by the lawman's promise to save Tommy's kid brother Vinnie (Brad Renfro) and cousin Joey (Giovanni Ribisi), who have become involved in the family business in Philadelphia. 
Tommy returns home to find Joey more or less running the family business, with Vinnie in tow, after the death of local kingpin Matello, (a flashback cameo by Dennis Hopper). 
Joey, a Scarface-type swaggerer with far more ambition than brains, wants to take over the territory from the Sicilians who wrested it from Matello. Encouraged by the FBI to take an active role in the succession of drug trafficking wars and truces that ensue, Tommy rakes in the money as he piles up the evidence.
Perfunctory love interest is supplied by Piper Perabo as a bartending widow with an asthmatic child, while Leslie Ann Warren, as Joey's mother, tearfully reps a lost generation. 
The women are generally seen as subservient and weepy, until they are forced into action by a rapist or intruder. The men, on the other hand, yearn nostalgically for the good old days when they hit rivals upside the head with beer bottles and shot people in dark alleys. 
Moresco is quite good with sudden violence. Longtime relationships, on the other hand, are granted short shrift. 
The mutual devotion between nice-guy Tommy and nutcase Joey is taken as a given, though it reads as improbably as does any glimmer of family resemblance between the clean-cut Marsden and cadaverish Ribisi. The "love story" between Marsden and Perabo might as well have been phoned in. 
Similarly, the labored implications of betrayal, lies and moral ambiguity represented by the "sell-out" of Desert Storm (featuring a walk-on by Val Kilmer as a bereaved father of a fallen marine) and the willingness of the FBI to encourage murder and mayhem enter the plot with all the subtlety of Ribisi's Joey in snakeskin suit striding through a butcher shop on the way to dispatch his enemies. 
Tech credits are adequate.

The trifling, cliché-choked trophy indie Robert Moresco  got to make after the success of Crash  (which he co-wrote), 10th & Wolf  is a hellish and unconvincing celebration of badda-bing-ness, supposedly based on a story by Joseph Pistone , the real-life "Donnie Brasco " (though Pistone's name appears nowhere in the credits). After being raised in the mob, Tommy (James Marsden ) joins the Marines  and then, at the behest of feds, returns to the Philly neighborhood where his dim brother Vincent (Brad Renfro ) is getting knee-deep in shit and his cold-blooded cousin Joey (Giovanni Ribisi ) is already some kind of rising goodfella. Whackings proliferate; out of spite, rage, or greed, the boys' mom (ultra-floozie Lesley Ann Warren ) enables the situation; and flashbacks to dunderheaded Dennis Hopper  and Val Kilmer  cameos enliven the muck. Mostly, though, it's a nonstop caricature fest; one cannot decide whom Ribisi is inadvertently parodying with his grimaces and glowerings, Robert De Niro  or himself. (Marsden, without his Cyclops shades, has the dullest pretty-boy face to never grace a Calvin Klein  billboard.) "Young Hollywood " neo-aristocracy posturing like gun-crazy street urchinsI'd rather watch Growing Up Gotti   for the first time.
