         Ever idiosyncratic and daring British filmmaker Sally Potter with "Yes" tells a searing — the only word for it — love story that lays bare the pain and rage of the conflicts between the Middle East and the West in the wake of 9/11 and the Iraq War, with its demonization of the Arab world on the one side and escalating hatred of America on the other.
 
  Bold, vibrant and impassioned, "Yes" is the work of a high-risk film artist in command of her medium and gifted in propelling her actors to soaring performances — yes, "soaring" is right, just as "searing" is. Potter, who first came to attention with the problematic "Orlando" (1992), is unafraid of letting herself getting carried away.
 


         






    In this instance, in two ways: First, in writing her dialogue in iambic pentameter; second, in going for an epilogue that can only be described as a Hollywood ending. There are moments when the rhyming works, but there are others when it seems merely silly or pretentious. Luckily, her actors are up to limning in verse with a lack of self-consciousness.
 
  The glory of the film is the remarkable Joan Allen, whose virtuosity is well matched by that of Simon Abkarian. Allen's "She" is a cool goddess, an eminent London-based microbiologist and Belfast-born American. She lives in a starkly decorated town house whose cold, spare elegance reflects the ashen state of her marriage to Anthony (Sam Neill), a successful politician and unfaithful husband. Anger and resentment lurk just beneath the surface of their poised public facade, but at a grand dinner when the unhappy She connects with a waiter (Abkarian), who will be known only as "He," she does not fight it. He turns out to be a Lebanese surgeon who fled Beirut a decade before and lives modestly as a restaurant cook.
 
  They plunge headlong into a torrid affair, but a nasty, potentially violent clash between He and several other cooks of varying ethnicity, religion and politics thrusts He back into his Arabic identity and culture, causing him to reject She as a symbol of a superpower that looks down on the Arab world. The fireworks in the kitchen, followed by He's rejection of She, cuts to the heart of the matter on various levels and in their ferocious intensity and luminosity recalls similar moments in "Crash."
 
  "Yes" involves a process of self-discovery for She even more than He. She tends to appropriate the pain and strife of her Northern Ireland heritage without ever embracing it — she neglects her leftist Belfast aunt (Sheila Hancock), who inspires She's best instincts — and tends to overlook that she left her birthplace at age 10 for America. Yet She is prepared to face herself and life itself with as much courage and honesty as she can muster. Allen and Abkarian have the presence, skill and commitment to take the viewer along on harrowing emotional journeys. Shirley Henderson, as She and Anthony's sly and unnervingly observant housekeeper, is the most important of several cleaners who serve as a Greek chorus, one of Potter's more effective devices.
 
  "Yes" is gorgeous and stylish for sure, and Potter in collaboration with guitarist Fred Frith composed for it an aptly seductive, sinuous score. If the film inspires a fence-sitting reaction it also evokes the feeling that "Yes" is a case of too much being preferable to the not enough that movies more often deliver.

 The first thing to say about Sally Potter's "Yes" is that it is written in verse - rhymed iambic pentameter, to be precise. This curious feature may not, however, be the first thing you notice about the movie, given Ms. Potter's knack for enjambment and her cast's impressive ability to make highly artificial language sound like natural speech. The rhythms of their dialogue are at once odd and familiar, and the meter gives the picture a brisk momentum, making it feel like the expression of single, sustained impulse. "Yes" is not just a movie, in other words, it's a poem.  A bad poem. There is no denying Ms. Potter's skill at versifying - or for that matter, at composing clear, striking visual images - but her intricate, measured lines amount to doggerel, not art. Her formal ingenuity (also on display in "Orlando" and "The Man Who Cried"), which it would be unkind to dismiss as mere pretension, is yoked to ideas of almost staggering banality, and she sacrifices the seriousness of a group of superb actors on the altar of her own intellectual vanity. Her ambitions could hardly be larger - this wants to be a movie about love, hate, class, religion, ethnicity, science and the fractious state of the modern world - but rather than expanding our sense of what it all means, Ms. Potter shrinks it down to a single syllable. Tempting as it is to contradict her yes with a simple no, other responses also come to mind. And? So? What?  The two main characters are themselves monosyllabic generalities: an adulterous couple known only as He and She. He is a Lebanese refugee living in London, a surgeon in his home country and a restaurant cook in his city of exile. She is an American scientist who spent her childhood in Northern Ireland and who now endures a cold marriage with a stuffy British  diplomat. He (the cook, not the diplomat) is played by a gifted Armenian-Lebanese actor named Simon Abkarian,  whose work  has mainly been in French movies and on the Paris stage. She is the incomparable Joan Allen, whose bearing grows at once more supple and more regal with every film. Sam Neill, as the husband, joins the list of eminent actors (Anthony Hopkins and Kevin Kline are at the top) who have portrayed Ms. Allen's worse half, and he gallantly plays along in a game that is rigged against him from the start. Ms. Allen suffers not just nobly, but intelligently, and briskly pockets  the audience's sympathy and its admiration.  Sympathy is in order, not necessarily for the overblown tristesse of the characters, but for the valiant actors, who do their best to give subtle, vivid, human performances, only to find themselves banging against the bars of the allegorical cage Ms. Potter has built for them. He and She after batting eyes and exchanging pleasantries at a stuffy formal dinner, begin a love affair that before long becomes a geopolitical crisis in microcosm. The differences between them - of religion, culture and circumstance - drive them apart, as all the complex hatreds of the modern world press down on their simple desire to be in love.  Or so Ms. Potter would have us believe. But really, the main obstacle facing them is the director's dogmatic belief that human beings exist mainly, if not solely,  as accretions of identity. Another way to say this is to observe that "Yes," a movie that proudly (if lazily) flies the flag of tolerance and cosmopolitanism, consists of nothing but stereotypes. He, with his long mustache and expressive hands, is a figure out of a threadbare Orientalist carpet: florid of speech, emotionally volatile, oscillating wildly between pride and self-pity. She is the embodiment of chilly Western rationality, and the twain can only meet in bed. Or on the beach in Cuba, which turns out to be the only place in the world free from the frigid materialism of the developed world and the blood hatreds of the Middle East. (Well, maybe North Korea too, but the climate there is not as pleasant.)  The secondary characters are also cartoonishly drawn, from the thin-lipped, deceiving husband to the best friend whose motherly sentimentality is a challenge to the heroine's childless reserve. The hero's co-workers in the kitchen include a black West Indian whose promiscuous love of women has given way to a beaming affection for Jesus, and a white Briton with spiky hair and a foul mouth who reveals himself in the heat of argument to be an anti-immigrant bigot. The only figure capable of any mischief or surprise, or any humor, -is a house cleaner (Shirley Henderson) who functions as tour guide, Greek chorus and voice of the otherwise silent working class.  Meanwhile, He and She, having recoiled from their initial sexual bliss, start arguing politics. Since She spent part of her childhood in Belfast, she is excused from bearing a full measure of imperialist guilt. Like her lover, she can claim a homeland riven by religious hatred. But his sympathy wears thin after a confrontation with his racist co-worker, and He assails She with rhetoric about honor and shame, blood and oil, and the poverty of Western civilization, which apparently consists of "Elvis and Eminem and Warhol's Art." "I have read the Bible -  have you read the Koran?" He demands.  "The things that they have done have not been in my name," She says,  speaking not of Elvis or Warhol but of the unnameable Voldemorts in the American government. "I feel no pride. I feel a deepening shame." The shame is that this sentiment has the psychological weight and ideological nuance of a bumper sticker, which is pretty much what "Yes" amounts to. Ms. Potter has made much of the fact that she began writing the screenplay shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks, but her film is strikingly the work of somebody whose view of the world has not been significantly altered by that event or any other recent catastrophe. "Yes" offers a case study in the moral complacency of the creative class, and its verbal cleverness cannot disguise the vacuous self-affirmation summed up in the title. For all her intellectual posing, Ms. Potter does not want you to think, but rather to nod your head in agreement. Please.  "Yes" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) It has some sexual content and strong language.

Bursting with heavy-handed postulations about everything from global terrorism to the ethos of dust particles, Sally Potter's "Yes" is a deeply idiosyncratic essay film made under the signs of Derek Jarman, Peter Greenaway and playwright Tony Kushner, but not nearly up to the level of those artists' best work. Staring Joan Allen as an Irish-American scientist who enters into an affair with a Lebanese cook, pic ultimately has nothing of any real depth or profundity to say, but a thousand self-consciously complex ways of saying it. Sure to have its partisans, as it did in Telluride, pic is the type of purely intellectual construct that, even when it works, inspires most audiences to say "No."
Arriving on the heels of Potter's terminally silly Johnny Depp starrer "The Man Who Cried" and the solipsistic "The Tango Lesson," "Yes" serves as further indication that Potter's striking 1992 feature, "Orlando," may have been a fluke.
After opening with an amusing if showy monologue delivered directly to camera by chameleonic Scottish actress Shirley Henderson (playing a housemaid), "Yes" switches its focus to a molecular biologist (Allen) and her politico husband (Sam Neill), trapped in a busted-up marriage.
At a dinner party, Allen (whose character is unnamed in the film and referred to in press notes only as "She") catches the eye of the cook (Armenian thesp Simon Abkarian, fittingly known only as "He"). She flirts with him a bit and leaves him with her phone number. After returning from an international conference, she calls him up and an affair begins.
By this point, it's already obvious that "Yes" is no ordinary tale of adultery. Not only have the characters not been assigned names, but when they open their mouths, dialogue tends to emerge as rhyming couplets -- often quite bad ones. (Example: "Call me whore. I'll ask for more.") On those occasions when the dialogue takes a momentary respite, viewers are made privy to the characters' innermost thoughts, presented as rambling voiceovers in the fashion Wim Wenders employed (to much stronger effect) in "Wings of Desire."
Pic is built around a series of encounters between He and She, including one particularly silly public display of sexual attraction that feels like an outtake from Jane Campion's "In the Cut." However, viewers never learn more than the most basic information about who these people are or what drives them -- a strategy that might have worked better if the film's theoretical ideas were themselves more interesting.
Clearly, as in Kushner's "Homebody/Kabul," Potter intends her characters to register less in a specific sense than as archetypical sides of a timely geopolitical divide -- the compassionate, yet inevitably imperialistic Westerner trying, yet failing to understand the psychologically and emotionally oppressed Middle Easterner. But unlike Kushner -- or, for that matter, Jean-Luc Godard, in the recent "Our Music" -- Potter never moves past the surface of that cliche notion.
While an assortment of other narrative tangents present themselves -- She's guilt-riddled relationship with elderly Irish aunt (Sheila Hancock); He's tense dealings with the other members of the kitchen staff -- "Yes" only becomes increasingly tedious as it progresses.
And though Allen and Abkarian (who made a big impression as the lead in Michel Deville's "Almost Peaceful" in 2002) are powerful actors, both are finally at a loss in their efforts to make something meaningful out of the material, or at least something closer to a movie than a doctoral thesis.
Shot in Super 16mm by Alexei Rodionov, pic has a deliberately grainy, slightly overexposed texture, which Potter then transfigures through an endless succession of dissolves, video-shot inserts, slow-motion effects and other manipulations that seem designed (as in the worst of Greenaway) to keep auds from noticing how empty pic really is.
Soundtrack is a similarly undigested overload of recycled pieces by Tom Waits, Philip Glass and Kronos Quartet, plus original compositions by Potter herself.

With the recent spike in Iraq  carnage, it may seem genteel to propose working through Muslim-West cultural tensions in the form of forbidden romancein iambic pentameter no less. But we're dealing with Sally Potter , whose films (Orlando , The Man Who Cried ) demand leaps of faith and often reward them. In Yes , which unfurls entirely in verse, Joan Allen  plays an Irish American biologist whose antiseptic work in blue-lit labs mirrors the icy vibe of her opulent London home. Her husband (Sam Neill ) is a fatigued Blair-like politico who unwinds by getting Scotched up and playing air guitar to B.B. King .
Allen's character feels alive only when her flirtation with a Lebanese restaurant worker (Simon Abkarian ) becomes an affair. Potter is, as usual, attentive to the female viewpoint. She lingers on the burst of cultural sharing that begins the trystsensual talk of native fruits and heritage, the tentative move to subjects of language and numeracy, the delighted discovery of new mating rituals. But sheet-lolling scenes are soon spliced with more kinetic ones of the male lover's fraught work life, a Shakespearean kitchen dumb show that turns on the alternately funny and vicious barbs of his co-workersa Scot, an East Ender, a Jamaican immigrantall suspicious of one another but resentfully bound by class. The Allen character, known only as "She," has no access to her lover's post-9-11 pressures, and when the precarious situation of this man who forfeited his job as a surgeon for manual labor in the West falls apart, she can only take his fury personally.
Potter indicts both characters' prejudices while advancing a version of a rarely depicted middle-aged female fantasy. Her tactics might seem at once too dogmatic and too flowery. Both attributes combine in a Hallmark-ish Cuban beach sequence that unites the two lovers with a global radical tradition. But in jettisoning the patterns and pacing of Hollywood -ized male fantasy, she's aiming her critique at nothing less than the main conundrum of both characters' culturesthe problem of a woman's freedom. Even the freedom to be flowery or dogmatic. And when Yes  bristles with rhapsodic sex talk ("I'll fuck you as a mistress/As a queen!") and searing recriminations ("Terrorist!" "Bigot!" "Bitch!"), or veers off into the delightful soliloquies of a housekeeper (Shirley Henderson ) who uses unflushed condoms and dust bunnies to construct a philosophy of entropy and endurance, Potter's anachronistic rhyme schemes tumble forth with an out-damned-spot verve that rages against irrelevance.
