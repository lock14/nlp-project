         Why is it that sometimes there's nothing like a true story to ring false? It's a question for the ages, and there's plenty of time to ponder it during Ryan Murphy's adaptation of Augusten Burroughs' bestselling memoir, which lovingly and painstakingly recounts the years Burroughs spent as the legal charge of his crazy mother's crazier psychiatrist. "I guess it doesn't matter where I begin," says the narrator, just before the movie starts. "No one is going to believe me anyway." At that point, though, there's still no reason to suspect he's right.
 
  Murphy, who created the creepy, funny, lunatic "Nip/Tuck," is a master of mordant and macabre camp. But here he loses his teeth, seeming to lack any ironic distance from material that practically begs for it. The incredible true adventures of a flamboyant kid abandoned by his terrible parents on the cusp of adolescence, "Running With Scissors" could have used a little dose of skepticism in the adaptation. (I mean, isn't every 
adult in every 
teenager's life a delusional psychopath?) That's not to cast doubt on events as recounted — especially not in this day and age, when the time-honored tradition of personal memoir embellishment will get you hauled in front of Oprah's Grand Tribunal and publicly excoriated in front of millions of shut-ins, stay-at-homes and writers (something I wouldn't wish on anybody) — but to say that there's something murky and indistinct about the movie's point of view. It's hard to tell where Burroughs' ends and Murphy's begins. Burroughs' coming-of-age was so fabulously disco-Dickensian that he took notes. Surely, Murphy — in the words of an immortal freshman English major boyfriend — could sympathize but not empathize, but it's the impulse to empathize that gets him into trouble. The director seems to buy the author's fond auto-enshrinement wholesale and everyone gets hurt.
 


         






    Augusten's (Joseph Cross) story begins in 1972, when his mother, Deirdre (Annette Bening), decides that her husband, Norman (Alec Baldwin), is trying to stifle her creatively and then kill her. Deirdre is a self-published poet with an Anne Sexton obsession — tapping into her anger is her job. When Norman doesn't agree to daily five-hour sessions with her Santa Claus-resembling, valium-dispensing, bowel movement-obsessed shrink, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox), she leaves him and dumps Augusten at Finch's in order to check into a motel and "unblock her unconscious." And Norman, Augusten soon finds out, won't take his calls.
 
  This is how 13-year-old Augusten comes to spend two years living at the Finches'. The doctor's family lives in a Pepto-Bismol pink Victorian mansion with papered-up windows, a lawn festooned with garbage, dishes piled to the ceiling and a Christmas tree that never comes down. Finch's wife, Agnes (Jill Clayburgh), is a catatonic shut-in who spends her days gaping at horror movies on TV and eating dog kibble out of the bag. Elder daughter Hope (Gwyneth Paltrow), who does her best to emulate a Victorian spinster, makes decisions by "Bible-dipping" (opening the book at random and pointing to a word) and claims she can talk to the cat. When the cat dies, the family stages a funeral apparently production-designed by Edward Gorey.
 
  This is a lot of quirk, even for a Wes Anderson fan, and it feels like an attempt to distract from the fact that while a lot is going on, nothing is really happening. Deirdre goes crazy and stays crazy. Norman leaves and stays left. Finch starts weird and ends weird — and so on. Part of the problem is that the characters feel scattered around like ornaments; there's no real insight into their lives, no sense of their pasts, no hint as to how they got this way. Was Agnes always a kibble-eater, or did something in particular tip her over the edge? Have they ever seen "Grey Gardens"?
 
  In the meantime, there's much running around and shouting, but from the moment Augusten enters the house, you just want him to leave, and it feels like waiting to grow up. The one bright spot in Augusten's life is Finch's younger daughter Natalie (Evan Rachel Wood), a '70s vamp in disco regalia who takes him under her wing and introduces him to his first love, a 35-year-old schizophrenic named Neil Bookman (Joseph Fiennes), but by the time she enters it's pretty clear that Augusten, despite the artistic goldmine he's fallen into, doesn't display much of an inner life. Given little more to do than react, Cross seems to drift through the movie in a state of permanent lighthearted outrage at the mental institution that is his life.
 
  The movie would have been much more involving if all but two of the characters (one, not counting the guy telling the story) weren't completely bonkers. But there are no sane people in Augusten's life; no functioning adults, no school officials, no social workers, no teachers, no concerned neighbors — really, it's like a mainstream suburban version of "Marat/Sade." Patrick Wilson shows up for two seconds as an IRS agent, but other than that, nothing. If Augusten seems more prisoner than protagonist, Deirdre is the toxic gas that chokes the air out of the movie. Bening thoroughly convinces you of Deirdre's mental illness — which makes her a bit of a nullity as a character, unfortunately. Still the movie takes its cues from her and feels histrionic, mannered and just tiresome after a while.

Watching Running With Scissors  the movie instead of reading Running With Scissors  the best-selling memoir by Augusten Burroughs is like running with a spatula, or maybe some weird toast tongs. The experience is unusual  zany, even  but not nearly as dangerous or exhilarating as one would hope from the recklessness the title implies. This is quite a feat of dullness on the part of writer-director (and Nip/Tuck  creator) Ryan Murphy, considering the rawness of Burroughs' unenviably colorful autobiographical material: Raised by a monstrously narcissistic mother (Annette Bening) prone to psychosis and the creation of bad poetry, young Augusten (Joseph Cross) is deposited like a foster kid in the home of his mother's barmy psychiatrist, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox). And in the way of crazy shrinks throughout psychoanalytic history, Finch has a brood (Jill Clayburgh as meek wife, Gwyneth Paltrow and Evan Rachel Wood as damaged daughters, Joseph Fiennes as profoundly disturbed ''adopted'' son) that makes the clan in Little Miss Sunshine   or The Addams Family   seem Walton fresh and functional.
Burroughs describes life in the Finch hell house with bleak hilarity that gains power from the suggestion of warped ordinariness  doesn't every shrink wake his sleeping family to admire what he has just produced in the toilet? But Murphy, a first-time feature filmmaker, lacks an equivalent voice of his own  or the confidence to influence through understatement; instead, he goes for the shorthand of ornate retro-'70s production and costume design, bumping up against arch kitsch. (To call the cluttered house itself a character, as the director has, is to cede narrative control.) Bening is elegantly unvain in her ferocious performance as a bad, sick mother, but in this standing-still adaptation she's bested by kitchen decor.

 Like its source, Augusten Burroughs’s best-selling memoir, the new movie “Running With Scissors” is by turns hilarious and appalling. Set in an era of garish interior design (nicely captured by Richard Sherman, the film’s production designer, and his colleagues) and dubious social experiments, the film is a chronicle of adult weakness and poor judgment seen through the eyes of a bright teenage boy. Joseph Cross, a 20-year-old actor with an intelligent face and a pleasant manner (he also has a small role in Clint Eastwood’s “Flags of Our Fathers”), plays young Augusten, who is sent to live with his mother’s psychiatrist.  But that hardly captures the grotesque real-life comedy that Ryan Murphy, a creator of the cable series “Nip/Tuck,” sets out to portray as the director and writer of this film. Augusten’s mother, Deirdre, is played by Annette Bening in a performance that is a minor classic in the monstrous-movie-mom pantheon. Deirdre, whose husband (Alec Baldwin) is an easily distracted, frequently exasperated alcoholic, dreams of being a famous writer. Or, rather, she is convinced that she already is one, if only the world would wake up and acknowledge her gifts. Her son believes in her, or at least humors her, which makes her abandonment of him especially cruel, and also more than a little self-destructive.  Ms. Bening’s precise, pitiless tracing of her character’s decline from feisty defiance to pathetic, overmedicated self-delusion gives the film an emotional weight it might not otherwise have. As is often the case with adaptations of this kind, the loss of the first-person voice creates a dramatic void at the heart of the story. Engaging as he is, Mr. Cross often seems like more of an observer than a participant, and his Augusten seems curiously invulnerable to the madness that surrounds him.  Seeking solace and support in her crumbling marriage and her stalled ambition, Deirdre falls under the sway of Dr. Finch, her therapist, who hovers somewhere on the spectrum between utter charlatan and complete lunatic. Brian Cox, who was Hannibal Lecter before Anthony Hopkins took over the franchise, is very good at playing this type of character, and he is by turns charismatic and absurd, charming and frightening, channeling his own tendency toward hamminess into Dr. Finch’s histrionic personality. Dr. Finch lives in a huge wreck of a house — the decorating scheme, when it is visible amid all the filth, might be described as acid-trip Victorian — into which Augusten is dropped like a stray animal. He joins a menagerie that includes Dr. Finch’s daughters, Natalie (Evan Rachel Wood) and Hope (Gwyneth Paltrow), and their mother, a fluttery, stringy-haired, terribly damaged enabler played without vanity by Jill Clayburgh.  Add Joseph Fiennes as a patient of Dr. Finch’s who becomes Augusten’s lover and Gabrielle Union as Deirdre’s new flame, and you have an impressive scrapbook of well-observed, offbeat performances, which is almost enough to make “Running With Scissors” worthwhile. The problem is that the efforts of the actors don’t add up to much more than a series of uncomfortable, funny-horrible vignettes in a scattered, shapeless movie. Despite the tale’s undeniably horrific elements, Mr. Murphy conveys little sense of real anguish or danger, and he holds the characters at arm’s length. With the exception of Deirdre, whose willingness to sacrifice her son and her sanity to a mirage of personal fulfillment takes a visible toll on her, they seem static and a little unreal, freakish specimens of human failure pinned to a velvet cushion so we can watch them squirm, and squirm along with them.  “Running With Scissors” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has many disturbing scenes of sexuality, drug use and age-inappropriate behavior and professional misconduct.

The royally screwed-up adolescence of Augusten Burroughs has made it to the bigscreen with several nips, tucks and a noticeably duller edge in "Running With Scissors." Writer-director Ryan Murphy strives mightily to capture the bracing hilarity, pathos and surreal incident of Burroughs' bestselling memoir, but this rudderless adaptation never gets a firm grip on the author's deadpan tone or episodic narrative style. With critical attention likely to focus less on the film than the strong individual performances, specifically Annette Bening's monstrously entertaining turn as Burroughs' mother, Sony may have difficulty luring niche audiences beyond the book's estimable readership.
Published to great acclaim in 2002, "Running With Scissors" all but rewrote the book on traumatic childhoods with its tale of parental abandonment, mental illness, pedophilia and the most idiosyncratic foster family this side of the Royal Tenenbaums. Yet Burroughs' distinct comic voice, his ability to relate the wackiest events imaginable in dryly matter-of-fact prose, also managed to neutralize any traces of self-pity.
That voice proves maddeningly elusive here, despite the first-person narration that poses a question at the outset: "Where do I begin to tell the story of how my mother left me, and then I left her?"
First scene is set in the Burroughs' Massachusetts home in 1972, with 7-year-old Augusten (Jack Kaeding) listening attentively to his mother, Deirdre (Bening), read a poem she plans to submit to the New Yorker. Bening's recitation immediately suggests qualities that become more pronounced in Deirdre throughout the film -- her futile dreams of a successful writing career, her smothering narcissism and her need to draw strength from her son, to the point of treating him as little more than an adoring fan.
Six years later, as her marriage to Augusten's alcoholic father Norman (a stoic Alec Baldwin) deteriorates, Deirdre begins seeing a therapist, Dr. Finch (Brian Cox), known for his unusual and progressive methods. The couple's spiteful joint sessions don't forestall their inevitable divorce, but Deirdre continues to visit the doctor with Augusten (now played by Joseph Cross), who is fascinated by this odd, Santa Claus-like figure.
The film begins its descent into the rabbit hole when mother and son visit Dr. Finch's home, a ramshackle Victorian house with shocking-pink exteriors and rooms strewn with garbage, arcane memorabilia and other bizarre odds and ends (superbly outfitted by production designer Richard Sherman).
No less eccentric are the house's inhabitants: Dr. Finch's wife Agnes (Jill Clayburgh), who watches "Dark Shadows" and eats kibble; his older daughter Hope (Gwyneth Paltrow), who makes every decision by pointing at a word in the Bible at random and interpreting it accordingly; and fiery younger daughter Natalie (Evan Rachel Wood), whose heavy eye shadow signals her more rebellious nature.
Deirdre and Dr. Finch abruptly inform Augusten he will be staying with the doctor indefinitely while Deirdre recovers from her neuroses. Augusten soon comes to view the Finch family as his own. He befriends Dr. Finch's thirtysomething adopted son, Neil Bookman (Joseph Fiennes, looking like a dark, mustachioed elf), and their relationship quickly turns sexual. It's a sign of how strange his life has become that this registers as one of the story's less shocking details, though the film's sanitized depiction of their couplings is considerably less graphic and intense than the book's.
Making his feature writing and helming debut, Murphy (the force behind FX's plastic surgery drama "Nip/Tuck") has pared Burroughs' anecdotal tome down to a choice selection of humorous episodes, excising several characters.
Yet while individual scenes are memorable, the picture that emerges is more of a crazy-quilt (literally) than a cohesive drama. It's a messy, discursive piece of work, capturing the freewheeling sense of life in the Finch household but never giving the characters' deeper connections and psychological motivations their proper due.
As is often the case with filmed memoirs, the reduction of the narrator to just another figure robs the story of its most important voice. And while Cross makes an engaging and thoroughly believable Augusten, his performance is essentially reactive; the film rarely succeeds in getting under his skin.
Bening's full-bodied performance, on the other hand, achieves a level of complexity and coherence that eludes the rest of the film. Modulating expertly between Deirdre's self-pitying rationalizations and explosive fits of temper, the actress channels qualities she's conveyed memorably in her previous roles, from her marital frustration in "American Beauty" to her self-absorbed love of play-acting in "Being Julia." Thesp uses her voice to richly theatrical effect when reading Deirdre's navel-gazing poetry, yet resists the temptation to either demonize or caricaturize her.
Other cast standouts are Cox, savoring every droll syllable as the alternately benign and threatening Dr. Finch; and Clayburgh, who brings a rich emotional life to the haggard, long-suffering Agnes. Her final scene with Augusten is immensely moving.
Strong tech credits feature a host of "Nip/Tuck" regulars, including editor Byron Smith; cinematographer Christopher Baffa, whose widescreen lensing is suitably on the dark side; Lou Eyrich, showing a zany sense of invention with the actors' costumes; and James S. Levine, who penned the bittersweet score.
Though the soundtrack is smeared with period-appropriate tunes from the likes of Elton John, Bruce Springsteen, 10cc and Bill Evans, pic doesn't overdo the '70s ambience.

"I guess it doesn't matter where I begin," reasons the adult narrator of Running With  Scissors , the inevitable Oscar contender adapted from Augusten Burroughs 's wacky memoir of coming out as a gay teen in his adoptive guru's carnivalesque commune. "No one is gonna believe me anyway."
No one? In fact, Burroughs's public has bought his story in a big way: The book has earned awestruck reviews and moved roughly a million copies. The movie, which Nip/Tuck creator Ryan Murphy  has shaped into an enjoyably overwrought ode to the kid's miraculous survival of everything from parental abandonment and pedophilia to bad '70s fashion, proves a classic 'Me' decade maxim: That which doesn't kill you makes absolutely fabulous materialprovided your mother doesn't use it first.
Like the stranger-than-fiction shocker that turned its author's painful adolescence into gold, the Hollywood  Scissors  starts with the six-year-old Augusten precociously putting rollers in Mom's hair, the two drama queens competing for close-ups. Annette Bening  may well collect an Academy Award  for her inspired turn as Deirdre, the neglectful mother who's ditched by her son on his way to achieving poetic justice. But there's no mistaking the true star of this show. Indeed, it ends with a winking cameo by the real Burroughs, 40 going on 17, literally shoving offscreen the young unknown who plays him in the movie.
Until that climactic "look, Ma" moment, Burroughsplayed from age 13 to 16 by wide-eyed newcomer Joseph Cross serves as the straight man, so to speak, in a comedy where the inmates are running the asylum. Bening reportedly prepared for the role of pill-popping Deirdre by calculating the precise sound of each pharmacological slur right down to the milligram. But even more impressive is her ability to dignify this well-off white woman with her imagined "oppression" and very real struggle to "claim her voice as a woman and an artist"to humanize a character that in other hands would look like a vicious satire of '70s new-age feminism. As Dr. Finch, the certifiable professional who diagnoses Bening's blocked writer as having "constipation both literal and subconscious," Brian Cox  goes beyond the book's cartoon Santa Claus  and scares up something closer to Max von Sydow 's exorcist.
Deirdre, floundering in her marriage to alcoholic Norman  (Alec Baldwin ), dumps the kid in the good doctor's mansion and the movie's Best Supporting Hams get to work: Gwyneth Paltrow  as the doctor's daughter Hope, dolled up like a Dutch milkmaid; Evan Rachel Wood  as younger daughter Natalie, using an electroshock therapy machine to play doctor with Augusten; Jill Clayburgh  as Mrs. Finch, staring blankly at Dark Shadows  reruns and munching on doggy kibbles; and Joseph Fiennes  as Bookman, the 33-year-old adopted son who takes young Augusten to bed. As Augusten, Cross has plenty to do just watching the other actors go nuts, which is fine because he's playing the author in training, taking mental notes of all this insanity.
Working in the immodestly expressive, every-room-a-set-piece spirit of Wes Anderson , first-time director Murphy, armed with the best '70s pop studio money can buy, renders the book's boy-in-a-bubble claustrophobia capablywhich has its disadvantages in terms of perspective. Staying indoors for most of the decade, the movie makes nothing of the irony that this adopted child of the freaky-deaky counterculture would find himself in the year of Ronald Reagan 's election. Still, tone is everything in a dark-comic farce, and Murphy pulls it off. Like the book, this deadpan celebration of neurosis makes a valiant effort to repress its comedywhich of course makes it funnier.
