         Werner HERZOG has been here before, and not just because he first visited this story in his 1997 documentary "Little Dieter Needs to Fly." His first Hollywood feature, "Rescue Dawn" is a dramatic interpretation of the true-life ordeal of U.S. Navy pilot Dieter Dengler, who escaped from a Laotian prisoner-of-war  camp and survived weeks in the jungle just before the start of the Vietnam War. Herzog returns to the themes that have preoccupied him throughout his career — the single-minded hero with the impossible dream, the cruel indifference of nature to his desires, the obsessions that rescue and doom him. Like the protagonists of "Fitzcarraldo" and "Aguirre: The Wrath of God," Dengler is the quintessential Herzog hero, evincing a strength of purpose that strains at the edges of human potential and possessed of an unwavering certainty that flirts with crazy but — in this case, at least — declines to seal the deal.
 
 
 FOR THE RECORD:



         






    'Rescue Dawn': A review of "Rescue Dawn" in the July 4 Calendar said Navy pilot Dieter Dengler escaped from a Laotian prisoner-of-war camp and survived weeks in the jungle just before the start of the Vietnam War. As the review later says, Dengler was held as a prisoner of war in 1966; that was after the start of the Vietnam War. The review also said that Dengler became obsessed with flying after a bomber flew so close to his house that he was able to look the pilot in the eyes. The plane that flew by that he said made a lasting impression was a single-engine fighter. —
 

 
 As portrayed by a simultaneously vulpine and puppyish Christian Bale, pared down to skin and bones for the role, Dieter appears to be  psychologically incapable of countenancing defeat. Born in Germany during World War II, Dieter's earliest experiences were marked by extreme deprivation and hardship. He became obsessed with flying after a bomber flew so close to his house that he was able to look the pilot in the eyes. It's a defining incident that Dengler recounts in the documentary and Bale reprises in the film. As vivid as the anecdote  is, it's hard not to wonder if the experience has not been distorted in his memory by the need to impart order and meaning on the senseless suffering.
 
 If indeed Dieter's memory of the event is more interpretation than pure recollection, it's remarkable for its adaptiveness. You can't believe that this is what little Dieter takes away from his first brush with death. As one of his fellow POWs exclaims upon hearing the story, "a guy tries to kill you, and you want his job!"
 
 His childhood close encounter would not be the last time Dieter exchanged meaningful glances with death. The film begins in 1966, when Dieter and his battalion are sent on a secret bombing raid over Laos. After his plane is shot down, Dieter endures a few days of torture at the hands of Pathet Lao soldiers. After he refuses to sign a statement denouncing United States policies, he is taken to a POW camp.
 
 To Dieter's surprise, he meets two fellow Americans there, Duane  (Steve Zahn) and Gene (Jeremy Davies), as well as three  Southeast Asian prisoners, Y.C. (Galen Yuen), Phisit (Abhujati Jusakul) and Procet (Chaiyan Chunsuttiwat). Some of them have languished in the camp for more than two years.
 
 Gradually, and against Gene's wishes, Dieter meticulously plans their escape.
 
 In different hands, this extraordinary story of survival might have played like a catalog of action tropes. And it would be something if suddenly Herzog decided to hit us with some slow-motion acrobatics against a Jimi Hendrix track (though I'm not sure what). None of the usual consolations is offered here — no soaring violins, or quivering nostrils, or righteous killings or platitudes about faith in God and government.
 
 Herzog has never been interested in mythmaking, and it's safe to say he isn't starting to be interested in it now. If anything, he seeks to do the opposite. He places three  people in one harrowing situation and watches them react. Aside from a riveting adventure story that  Herzog tells in all of its terrifying, stripped-down simplicity, "Rescue Dawn" is a fascinating study of human particularity. Bale, Zahn and Davies disappear completely into their roles — for that matter, they nearly disappear altogether — as three men with wildly different approaches to life. A docile company man, Gene remains convinced until the end that the Army is planning his rescue — even though the Army prefers not to admit he exists. He is suspicious and fearful of Dieter's flouting of authority and confused by Dieter's self-reliance. Duane, on the other hand, attaches himself to the leader who offers him the best chance at survival. It's amazing to see Davies and Zahn reduced to emaciated nubs of pure character — talk about who you are in a crisis. And Bale does something amazing, his Dieter seems to become more calm, more sure of himself with every passing day, until he practically glows.
 
 In "Little Dieter Learns to Fly," the real Dengler gives Herzog a tour of his house, revealing the terrors that never left him, like his lifelong fear of hunger and closed doors. What makes Dieter fascinating is not what he feared but what the fear made him do. Dieter's talents weren't limited to picking handcuffs, hording rice or plotting ambushes. He created a game in which he and the other prisoners took turns detailing the contents of an ideal imaginary refrigerator. Survival, as Herzog suggests, requires a combination of attention to detail and imagination, craft and faith. It's an art, in other words, and Dengler was quite possibly its genius.

Werner Herzog has bushwhacked a marvelously unmappable career for over 40 years, pursuing the stories of men who pit their wills against nature. In fact, the German filmmaker's decades-long obsession with the beauty and hubris of masculine determination  from Aguirre, the Wrath of God  in 1972 to Grizzly Man  in 2005  can be seen as his own essential life's work. In the same way Timothy Treadwell staked his life to the point of madness on a celebration of bears, Herzog is magnetically drawn to the fissure between fact and myth to find out why a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. He loves the winner and the loser with equal curiosity.
But of all the men he's measured, none, it seems, has moved him quite like Dieter Dengler, a German-born U.S. Navy pilot who was shot down over Laos in 1966 and held in a jungle prison by Pathet Lao soldiers. That Dengler managed to escape, through a combination of resourcefulness, strength of spirit, and sheer luck  and then to find rescue  dazzled the filmmaker when he made his 1997 documentary Little Dieter Needs to Fly . (After receiving a Navy Cross for his heroism, Dengler continued to fly as a test pilot; he died of ALS in 2001 at the age of 62.) But something about the man, with his positive attitude even in the midst of what others might reasonably accept as hopeless continued to intrigue Herzog. His fellow countryman, Herzog has said, embodies everything the filmmaker loves about America: ''Courage, perseverance, optimism, self-reliance.... He was the quintessential immigrant into America  a young man who arrived with a great dream and came to represent the best of the American spirit.''
So little Werner needs to tell the story again  dramatized this time, with a brilliant Christian Bale doing Dengler's memory fine justice in Rescue Dawn . Flying low under the radar while louder blockbuster contraptions shriek through the pop cultural skies, the movie is an exciting stealth weapon on many levels. It is, for starters, an amazing story, all the more so for being true: how the pilot was captured and tortured, how he rallied other American and Thai POWs to escape with him (trained as a locksmith, he fashioned a pick to unshackle them), and how, with his last ounce of strength (he gnawed on dead snake for sustenance) he flagged down his Air Force rescuers, who at first thought he might be Vietcong.
But just as exciting  maybe even more so, for those who love the medium and, especially, the uplift of the great-escape genre  Rescue Dawn  is a triumphant Werner Herzog movie. It's a mature distillation, really, of what the director does at his best, clearing the path of any unnecessary decoration (no prisoner-to-prisoner chat about sweethearts back home, no political commentary, no emotionally detached authorial voice-over in sing-songy accents) to let excellent actors reenact incredible maneuvers real men once really did. Besides, nobody stalks the wild like the man who made Fitzcarraldo , a naturalist who respects the jungle as a snarl of life and death in which God and the Devil seem to share landscaping credit.
It's no news that Bale is an actor who thrives on the Outward Bound school of character preparation; mastering the technicalities of privation are simple as pie (or a starvation diet of no pie) for the star of Batman Begins  and The Machinist . Bale's surprise in Rescue Dawn  is the lightness of being  the modest, good-natured grace  that he locates in Dengler even under the most agonizing conditions. I've never seen the actor look more at home with his own taut charisma, or put his sinewy physicality to more rewarding use.
Nor has anyone ever seen Steve Zahn quite like this  frightened, despairing, and complexly adult as fellow prisoner Duane Martin, a U.S. helicopter pilot whose pessimistic plan, before meeting Dengler, was to wait for rescue he never really thought would come. The sweet-faced, shambling actor from That Thing You Do!  and Sahara  is a revelation as a man afraid to hope. (A third American POW, played by Jeremy Davies with the twitches and finger wiggles he characteristically employs to signify weakness of character, is more risk-averse.) As Martin comes to trust Dengler's plan, Zahn and Bale enact an enthralling masculine duet. Out of a harrowing story set in a foreign thicket, Herzog has found American beauty.

 Correction Appended  The Navy airman Dieter Dengler (Christian Bale), the hero of Werner Herzog’s Vietnam-era P.O.W. escape film, “Rescue Dawn,” at first seems a conventional action-movie hero:  handsome, resourceful, brave and optimistic. But the more time spent with him, the more eccentricities he reveals. He has a geeky laugh. His sunny-side-up speechifying suggests an elementary school gym coach with a Vince Lombardi fixation. He only seems typical.  So does Mr. Herzog’s movie, which reimagines his 1997 documentary, “Little Dieter Needs to Fly,” as a drama of imprisonment, survival and perseverance. Although financed independently, it superficially resembles the likes of “Papillon” and “The Great Escape.” With its straightforward narrative, which observes Dengler being shot down during his first mission over Laos; surviving torture, isolation, confinement and starvation; and hatching a daring breakout, “Rescue Dawn” seems a departure from Mr. Herzog’s “Aguirre, The Wrath of God,” “Fitzcarraldo,” “Grizzly Man” and other cautionary tales of visionary madmen.  Dengler is also an advertisement  for capitalist democracy: a German immigrant who survived Allied bombing during World War II, settled in the United States and became a baseball-and-apple-pie American. In early shipboard scenes, the film’s cinematographer, Peter Zeitlinger, lights Mr. Bale like Tom Cruise in “Top Gun,” and Mr. Bale’s gung-ho grin seals the comparison.  When Dengler’s captors demand that he sign a confession declaring himself a criminal, Dengler refuses, because to do so would be ungrateful to his adoptive country. He’s as matter-of-fact as a diabetic declining a chocolate bar. Yet these indicators of superheroism exist to be subverted. Dengler endures misery without succumbing to the despair that has crushed his cellmates, but he starts to seem as unhinged as Mr. Herzog’s Aguirre and Fitzcarraldo. Under these conditions, hope is a form of insanity.  Dengler is just one oddball among many. His comrades include best friend and mentor, Duane (the great Steve Zahn, whose ravaged face recalls Steve McQueen’s in “Papillon”), and “Gene from Eugene” (Jeremy Davies, in a boldly stylized, sure-to-be-divisive performance), a longhaired, emaciated redneck whose cadences and gestures suggest a deranged skid row preacher.  In the past, Mr. Herzog has been criticized for his tendency to treat residents of the third world as  part of the scenery, but in “Rescue Dawn” he has empathy for Dengler’s captors. They are prisoners, too. They’re vicious because they’re bored and depressed, but they occasionally display kindness. When they consider executing the prisoners and abandoning the camp, Mr. Herzog makes it clear that this potential course of action is not evidence of subhuman evil, but a desperate plan hatched by men who don’t have enough food to feed themselves and their inmates and would rather just go home to their families. As Duane explains to Dengler, “The jungle is the prison — don’t you get it?”  The film is not without flaws. The story’s basis in fact doesn’t inoculate it against charges of predictability. Klaus Badelt’s score can be intrusively emphatic. And the triumphant ending — in which Dengler is welcomed back to his carrier with applause and speeches — is disappointingly conventional. For the most part, though, “Rescue Dawn” is a marvel: a satisfying genre picture that challenges the viewer’s expectations.  The film’s most daring aspect is its portrait of the love that blossoms between men in bleak circumstances. While platonic, Dengler and Duane’s relationship has the depth and detail of a great marriage — one in which the spouses understand each other so well that they can have a silent conversation with their eyes. Dengler’s commitment to helping Duane escape — despite choking vines, whizzing bullets, pounding rain and leech-infested waters — is as reflexive as the integrity he displays when he refuses to sign that confession. As Dengler literally and figuratively lets Duane lean on him, the film’s tenderness goes so far beyond male-bonding cliché that it becomes a political statement: a radical reimagining of the phrase “doing what a man’s gotta do” that rejects John Wayne as a masculine ideal and replaces him with Jesus.    “Rescue Dawn” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has profanity, graphic violence, torture and assorted jungle miseries.

Helmer Werner Herzog has long delighted in smudging the line between documentary and fiction. His latest, "Rescue Dawn," goes an intriguing step further by dramatizing a story Herzog already told once in his 1997 docu "Little Dieter Needs to Fly," about Dieter Dengler, a fighter pilot who was shot down over Laos in 1965. Socko, kudo-worthy lead perf by Christian Bale, plot's deeply compelling account of survival and pic's obvious relevance to the war in Iraq could spell solid B.O. after its December bow. However, helmer's more passionate followers may find plainly told pic less rich in Herzogian "ecstatic truth" than usual.
In "Rescue Dawn," Herzog dispenses with any buildup, revealing how German-born Dengler, who in reality retained a thick German accent all his life, came to be a U.S. Air Force fight lieutenant. Sounding entirely American, Bale's version of Dengler at first seems more like just another cocky young recruit, keen as a blade to get up into the skies for his maiden combat flight, a top-secret bombing raid over Laos in 1965.
Before flying out, Dengler and his fellow pilots watch an authentic military information film from the period about surviving in the jungle, the exact same one mocked by Herzog's own voiceover in "Little Dieter" for its naive advice -- such as don't forget to wave at helicopters flying right above you.
Here the pilots themselves cynically heckle the info movie, but an extra irony is added that pays off beautifully at the end when some of its strategies turn out to be eminently sensible.
Once airborne, Dengler has barely dropped more than few bombs before he's shot down. Hardly injured, he survives for a night or two alone before being captured by a ragged squad of Laotian soldiers.
Helmer's script doesn't quite make the point clear here, but those who have seen "Little Dieter" will understand that Dengler's bravery in the face of innumerable threats to kill him stemmed partly from his knowledge that the Viet Cong considered him more useful alive than dead.
Even so, his captors have no qualms about torturing him. An ant's nest is tied to his face. His hands and feet tied, he's dragged by a cow across a village and nearly drowned in a shallow well. (Key shots make clear that Bale, rather than a double, seems to be enduring most of these ordeals himself.) And yet, when he's offered a chance to be released in a couple of weeks if he'll only sign a statement denouncing American imperialism (a false promise, as it turns out), he refuses. "I love America," he insists. "America gave me wings."
Finally, he ends up in a POW camp, where he meets two fellow American prisoners: gentle if somewhat broken-spirited Duane (Steve Zahn) and Gene (Jeremy Davies), who keeps insisting the war will be over soon so they shouldn't try to escape. He also meets three more sketchily limned Southeast Asians, English-speaker Y.C. (Galen Yuen), wiry Phisit (Abhijati Jusakul) and more stolid Procet (Chaiyan Chunsuttiwat).
Auds with shorter attention spans may fidget slightly during pic's long midsection in the camp, which effectively gets across the endurance test that was this experience. Dengler proves himself to be a natural leader, whose combo of unique skills (he happens to know how to unpick handcuffs) and sheer pig-headed will to survive keep his fellow prisoners' spirits up while they endure brutality from the guards and wait for the rainy season to start, when it makes more sense to escape.
Final act, however, quickens the pace and proves highly moving as Dengler and Duane, grown closer than lovers or friends could ever be, chivvy and support each other through the long march through the jungle. Meanwhile, waterborne scenes on a raft tip the hat to similar sequences in such Herzog classics as "Aguirre, the Wrath of God" (1972) and "Fitzcarraldo" (1982).
Indeed, at times Bale seems to be channeling some of the crazed intensity of the late Klaus Kinski, star of the aforementioned. Slimmed down, as is the rest of the cast (Davies looks practically skeletal), almost to the anorexic weight he achieved for "The Machinist," Bale proffers a remarkably physical perf that also shares some of Kinski's grace in motion.
Zahn, so often cast in lighter roles as a stoner goofball or just comic relief, more than holds his own against Bale, especially in his last scenes. On the thesping front, pic's one weak spot is Davies, typically twitchy, mannered and mumbling so much it's hard to make out his dialogue, although for some his addled attitude may seem to suit the period.
Otherwise, as far as establishing a sense of period goes, Herzog cleaves to a refreshing less-is-more philosophy. This may be the first Vietnam-set film in history not to feature a bar of Jimi Hendrix, the Rolling Stones or indeed any other rock music on its soundtrack. Instead, apart from Klaus Bartle's keening original score, featuring mournful cellos and piano tones, music used includes Wagnerian opera and other classical compositions. Helmer even eschews deploying the offbeat, world-music discoveries that often make his other films so distinctive.
Indeed, pic reps arguably Herzog's most straightforward, least original film for some time, and suspicions linger that he may have seen it as a last-chance crack at making a bigger-budgeted, mainstream venture that could earn coin and backing for more unusual future projects. Having said that, this polished, cleanly made pic still packs a wrenching emotional punch and, if backed by critics and auds, could earn more for Herzog than his last 10 features put together.
Resonances with current situation in Iraq -- the deluded belief it will all be over soon, the scenes of torture that echo Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib -- are there, but not overstated. In fact, final scenes, using thousands of extras from the Thai army (Thailand was used for some locations), have an almost gung-ho, pro-soldier if not pro-military, quality, and rep the only major deviation from the story told in "Little Dieter Needs to Fly."
Craft contributions from lenser Peter Zietlinger and editor Joe Bini, both of whom worked on "Little Dieter" and are regular, career-spanning Herzog collaborators, are first rate.

Just when it seemed Independence Day might be the exclusive province of Michael Bay 's Transformers , MGM rushes in with Rescue Dawn . Nothing if not appropriate, Werner Herzog 's latest feature, based on his 1997 documentary Little Dieter Needs to Fly , offers a suitably fantastic tale of war, freedom, and fortitude, set in the jungles of Indochina and featuring an immigrant lad who turns out to be just as American as John McCain or is it John McClane ?
Dieter Dengler  was, like Herzog, a small child during World War II; his town was destroyed in an American bombing raid. In Little Dieter Needs to Fly , he maintains that the plane strafing his home flew so low he actually made eye contact with the "almighty being" in the cockpit: "From then on, little Dieter needed to fly." This story is repeated in Rescue Dawn . "You're a strange bird, Dieter," is the response from a colleague. For sure: At 18, little Dieter left for victorious America, enlisting in the Air Force and peeling potatoes for years before he was permitted to enter Navy flight school. He graduated in 1966 and was sent to Vietnam .
Dieter went to war because he wanted to fly; he wanted to fly because his childhood had been traumatized by war. Perhaps to inoculate the viewer against the queasy realization that this relentlessly upbeat hero sought to inflict on others the pain he experienced as a child, Rescue Dawn  fudges chronology and opens with the questionable assertion that, "In 1965, few people believed that the still limited conflict in Vietnam would turn into a full-scale war." (There were 23,000 American soldiers in Vietnam at the end of 1964; a year later, there were 184,000.)
This disclaimer is followed by a crescendo of lush drone music and slo-mo aerial-bombing footage. It's Wagner lite but pure Herzog. (Little Dieter also includes some stunning aerial views of napalm explosions, if no images of napalm victims.) Dieterplayed by Christian Bale  with a sunny disposish and intermittent German accentand his comrades aboard an aircraft carrier in the Gulf of Tonkin , are thrilled to receive orders to bomb Vietcong sanctuaries inside Laos . And all concern for the morality vanishes when, two minutes into the mission, Dieter is shot down and captured by a scary band of Pathet Lao irregulars.
Tied down for the entertainment of the sadistic rabble, Dieter is subjected to the sort of torture Americans would never condone, even if someone were captured in the act of imagining a dirty bomb. Then he's put in a stockade with a number of other captured Americans, most spectacularly Jeremy Davies , whose patented neurotic-gesticulation riff keeps the movie bearable during the lengthy incarceration sequence.
Dieter's attitude oscillates between gung-ho enthusiastic and relentlessly positivehe's able to grin like Victor Mature even when the guards reduce prison rations to a stingy helping of live worms. He's certain that he's going to escape and determined to bring everyone along with him. The date is set for July 4, although it scarcely needs to be emphasized that Dieter's experience of savage captivity and escape through the wilderness is a story with a particular American resonance. Although suffused with Herzog's own particular brand of jungle madness, Rescue Dawn which was shot mainly in Thailand has as much in common with James Fenimore Cooper  novels and Viet-era Indian westerns (A Man Called Horse , Jeremiah Johnson  ) as it does with The Deer Hunter .
Little Dieter Needs to Fly  was a powerfully incantatory film, in part because of the actual Dengler's matter-of-fact description of running barefoot through the tangled tropical foliagedodging monsoons, sliding down ravines, fending off leeches, eating snakes, and fighting delirium as well as sudden attacks by Laotian tribals. Rescue Dawn , which rivals Apocalypto  as a jungle marathon, has all this and more. Bale even looks authentically starved (as in The Machinist ). But seeing Dengler's adventure staged hardly seems more real than hearing his accountalthough, as conventionally framed and lit as it is, Rescue Dawn  is the closest thing to a "real" movie that Herzog has ever made.
The lone conquistador has joined the club. Rescue Dawn  is a Rambo  movie without the Man (who, if I remember my Rambology, was himself of German descent). Here, Herzog demonstrates his own American-ness by applying Stallone's triumphalist logic. It's not enough for his essentially solitary protagonist to prevailsurvival needs to be consecrated by a mob of flyboys showing the love, and inscribed for the ages with a salutary confetti freeze-frame. Yo!
