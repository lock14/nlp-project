When Eastwood�s new film about the heroes of Iwo Jima sticks to its central concept � articulated in the following statement: �The right picture can win or lose a war� � his film is on fertile soil. After about the first third to half of the movie, the story detours from this quintessentially Eastwoodian theme of the deconstruction of the hero myth into a repetitive road tour of the American home front that merely marches in place while adding uncharacteristically sentimental mulch to Eastwood�s earlier thematic assault. The picture in question is of course Joe Rosenthal�s Pulitzer Prize-winning photo of six faceless soldiers � five Marines and one Navy Corpsman � raising the American flag on Iwo Jima�s Mount Suribachi. The vicious battle against the Japanese for the desolate island was a tipping point in the World War II campaign for the Pacific, although it came at a time when the American people were wearying of the war as the European campaign was drawing to a close and the government coffers for the war effort were running out of funds. Thus, the military shipped home the three surviving members of the photo (which was shot on the fifth day of the battle that ground on for another month) to tour the country on the government�s Seventh War Bond Tour, pimping their celebrity to raise cash for the war. The bulk of the film focuses on the subsequent discomfort the three men faced, knowing that the flag-raising was hardly a heroic moment, but rather a randomly captured moment of soldiers carrying out symbolic orders. They suffer a form of survivor�s guilt, knowing that a couple of the faceless flagraisers were misidentified and that other fallen comrades were more deserving of iconic celebrity. Of the three, Rene Gagnon (Bradford) takes to fame more readily than the others, ironic because his mediocre military skills had relegated to a behind-the-front role as a runner. The Corpsman, �Doc� Bradley (Phillippe), takes to the task of celebrity with the same easy grace he brought to everything else, although we see that dreams of Iwo Jima haunt him in his old age even though he never talked about the experience with his family. The third survivor, Ira Hayes (Beach), could have a whole movie devoted to his turmoil. A Native American, who only reluctantly participated in the War Bonds tour, Hayes descends into a spiral of alcoholism and sadness that becomes his life�s ongoing signature. Yet, Flags of Our Fathers
 barely scratches the surface of his story. Not helping the film coherence is its out-of-order chronology that hinges around the research Bradley�s son Jim (McCarthy) conducts decades later in preparation for his book, Flags of Our Fathers
, which had been optioned by Steven Spielberg, who served as a producer on Eastwood�s film. (The script is by back-to-back Oscar winner Paul Haggis, from a first script by Bill Broyles.) It�s impossible not to compare the landings on Iwo Jima with Spielberg�s heralded D-Day landing sequence in Saving Private Ryan
. Though filmed with more emotional restraint than Spielberg�s assault, Eastwood adopts more CGI strategies than in his previous films, and his sepia and khaki color palette isn�t always supportive of the illusion. It�s also impossible not to find resonance in the movie regarding the current war in Iraq, particularly the notorious photos from Abu Ghraib that managed in their own way to galvanize a nation�s emotions about the war effort. Maybe we won�t fully understand Eastwood�s film until we see the second part of this project, Letters From Iwo Jima
, his companion film seen from the Japanese viewpoint expected in 2007. On its own, however, Flags of Our Fathers
 merely flags.


There's a famous line from the 1962 John Ford movie ``The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" : ``When the legend becomes fact, print the legend." That sentiment goes to the heart of our national propensity for mythmaking, and it applies as much to war as to westerns.
In ``Flags of Our Fathers," his new film about the 1945 battle of Iwo Jima and its legendary flag-raising photo, Clint Eastwood simultaneously tries to honor the legend and lay bare the facts behind it. If that sounds confused, well, so is the movie.
``Flags" is also brutal, elegiac, caustic, noble, sentimental -- a World War II film that tries to be all things to all Americans. That may be a fine way to win elections but it's hard on good filmmaking. You come out of the theater impressed by the scope of Eastwood's reach and frustrated by how little remains in his grasp. As gifted as this filmmaker is, this isn't the sort of thing he does best.
The chief flaw of the film is structural: ``Flags" intercuts between the grueling 35-day battle itself, the ensuing US tour of three of the supposed flag-raisers, and modern-day sequences in which the son of one of the men interviews his late father's fellow servicemen, sifting their memories for the truth.
There are three movies here, in other words, and two of them are ``Saving Private Ryan. "
``Flags of Our Fathers" is based on the 2000 book by James Bradley , son of John ``Doc" Bradley, and at one time it was intended to be directed by Steven Spielberg , who commissioned a script by William Broyles Jr . Spielberg is still credited as producer, but when the directorial reins passed to Eastwood, he brought in his house screenwriter, Paul Haggis (``Million Dollar Baby" ), to fine-tune the script. That's a lot of cooks.
There are even more in the movie. As is now known, that iconic Joe Rosenthal photo of six men raising a US flag atop Mount Suribachi wasn't quite what it seemed. The flag had already been raised by members of Easy Company early on the morning of Feb. 23 , 1945, as American forces took control of the beachhead. Told that one of the Navy brass wanted it as a souvenir, a battalion commander ordered a switcheroo -- no one but the Marines should have the glory of the memento, in his opinion -- and sent another group up to replace the first flag.
That's
 the image that went into the newspapers and the history books: an accidental fraud that doubled as a booster shot for an exhausted and nearly bankrupt America. Only three of that second group were alive by the end of the long battle -- Navy corpsman Bradley (Ryan Phillippe ) and Marines Ira Hayes (Adam Beach ) and Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford ) -- and ``Flags" re-creates the months-long whistle-stop tour on which the US government sent them.
It's an orgy of patriotic overkill meant to sell war bonds (and it does, to the tune of $23.3 billion), but the effect of the hoopla on the psyches of the men is ruinous. Asked to climb papier-mâché replicas of Suribachi in stadiums across the country -- to fireworks and Sousa marches, no less -- they mostly retreat further into themselves. The slick, naive Gagnon is happy to play the war hero; he certainly looks the part. The taciturn ``Doc" Bradley, a medic who risked his life dozens of times a day to aid the wounded, constantly drifts back into bloody memories of the battle.
The movie presents Hayes as the primary victim. A Pima Indian trained as a Marine paratrooper , Hayes wants no part of the glory, but every time he steps away from the limelight, there's some racist fool to put him in his place. Crippled by survivor guilt, Hayes turns increasingly to alcohol. ``I can't take them calling me a hero," he moans to his government minder (John Benjamin Hickey ). ``All I did was try not to get shot."
It's a solid, unsettling point: What really makes a hero? ``Flags of Our Fathers" tries to answer by constantly returning to the battle for the tiny Pacific island one character likens to ``a burnt pork chop." We see good men die horrible deaths, and Eastwood memorializes as much military bungling as individual bravery.
These are harrowing sequences and bloody as hell, but they use the same cinematic vocabulary as the D-Day scenes in ``Saving Private Ryan" without establishing their own emotional beachhead. Desaturating the colors from Tom Stern's cinematography so that everything is olive drab and deep crimson, Eastwood thrusts dozens of helmeted young men at us and asks us to keep them all straight. You appreciate their actions even as you're sorting them out.
The Japanese, dug into caves, remain unseen except for an occasional detonated corpse. Anyway, Eastwood is giving them their own film: ``Letters From Iwo Jima," told from the Japanese perspective and due in February . The battle in ``Flags of Our Fathers" is between dueling notions of valor: the simpleminded kind used to sell war on the home front and the bitter, endlessly compromised sort found in the trenches themselves.
The relevance to current events is there for the taking; the director doesn't force the issue. He's more interested in the young warriors who get caught between the legend and the facts -- between what we want from them and what they endure for us. It's a monumental subject, and this heartsick but diffuse movie only occasionally glimpses its entirety.


         "Flags of Our Fathers" is a story of extremes. It's the story of great heroism on a tiny island, of a photograph taken in 1/400th of a second that wreaked havoc with the lives of everyone in it and influenced the course of a war.
 
  It's also a very American tale, set 60 years ago but startlingly relevant today, which intertwines and often contrasts bravery and chicanery, idealism and disillusion, war and propaganda, truth and national security. This sad true story wrings you out emotionally because it's concerned with both the deaths of young men in battle and what happens when the needs of those who survive clash with what society expects and politics demands.
 


         






    A narrative like this requires a measured, classical style to be most effective, and it couldn't have found a better director than Clint Eastwood. After two best picture Oscars, 26 films behind the camera and more than 50 years as an actor, Clint Eastwood knows a gripping story and how to tell it. He found this one in James Bradley's book about the celebrated Feb. 23, 1945, flag-raising on Iwo Jima, a narrative that was nearly a year on the New York Times bestseller list and has 3 million copies in print.
 
  Bradley (who co-wrote the book with Ron Powers) was not a disinterested World War II historian. His father, Navy corpsman John "Doc" Bradley, was the only non-Marine of the six men who raised the flag and figured in Joe Rosenthal's iconic photograph.
 
  Bradley was also one of the three who survived perhaps the most hellish battle of the war only to be brought back to the U.S. and exhibited like a prize heifer in a crucial war bonds tour, nicknamed the Mighty 7th, which saw the raising of an unprecedented and much-needed $26.3 billion for the war effort. The author's quest to understand how that unnerving combination of experiences whipsawed his father and his comrades is the engine that powers both the book and this gripping, emotional film.
 
  Certainly everything about the Iwo Jima firestorm and its aftermath turned out to be so much larger than life that it led to three previous films, a Johnny Cash song and the 100-ton statue of the six men that dominates Arlington National Cemetery.
 
  Twenty-seven Congressional Medals of Honor, the most ever for one battle, were earned on Iwo Jima; one-third of all Marines who died in World War II were killed on that 7 1/2-square-mile island, as were 95% of its 22,000 Japanese defenders, whose story Eastwood will tell in a parallel film, "Letters From Iwo Jima," to be released in early 2007.
 
  Making this carnage that much more poignant was the fact that most of it was happening to boys/men in their teens and early 20s. Eastwood and his casting director, Phyllis Huffman (who, like veteran production designer Henry Bumstead, died before the film was released), tried hard to select actors who either were young or looked it. The result is a strong ensemble that includes Ryan Phillippe, Jesse Bradford and Adam Beach as the three flag-raising survivors and Barry Pepper as their sergeant.
 
  Written by William Broyles Jr. (himself a former Marine) and Paul Haggis ("Million Dollar Baby," "Crash"), "Flags of Our Fathers" opts for an opening that is structurally complex, touching lightly on most of the situations and viewpoints the film will eventually flesh out.
 
  The first shot is of a young soldier (Phillippe) alone in the devastated lunar landscape that was Iwo Jima in combat (these sequences were shot in Iceland, which has similar black sand beaches). This, we learn in seconds, is a recurring dream an elderly Doc Bradley has of himself on Iwo, desperately looking for the close buddy, Ralph "Iggy" Ignatowski (Jamie Bell), who he has unaccountably become separated from.
 
  In addition to Bradley in combat and in retirement, we witness the fuss Rosenthal's photo, considered perhaps the most reproduced shot in history, made from the moment it was first seen. And we also get a glimpse of the surreal nature of the ensuing bond tour; the first flag-raising we see is not the real thing but a garish re-creation before 100,000 spectators at Chicago's Soldier Field.
 
  We also hear photographer Rosenthal as he attempts to explain why his picture touched a national nerve. "What we do in war, the cruelty is almost incomprehensible," he says. "But somehow we need to make sense of it. The right picture can win or lose a war. I took a lot of other pictures that day, but none of them made a difference. Looking it at, you could believe the sacrifice was not a waste."
 
  It's at this point that the men who raised the flag are introduced softly, not really differentiated from the others in their units. Though "Flags" eventually shows us all six, it concentrates on experienced Sgt. Mike Strank (Pepper, a veteran of "Saving Private Ryan") and the three men who will make it back alive.
 
  First among equals is Bradley, the calm, centered undertaker-in-training whose character is well served by Phillippe's naturally haunted air. Most problematic as a soldier is handsome Rene Gagnon (Bradford), a.k.a. "our own Tyrone Power," who literally joined the Marines because he liked the uniform.
 
  Then there is Ira Hayes ("Smoke Signals' " Beach), a Native American from the Pima tribe, a soldier whose grim experiences putting up with constant prejudicial put-downs and surviving the most brutal hand-to-hand combat are the emotional heart of the film. With the Japanese so entrenched in a system of underground bunkers and tunnels that many Marines never saw an enemy soldier alive, the landing at Iwo is portrayed, in the film's action centerpiece, as especially devastating in the "Saving Private Ryan" tradition. As shot by Eastwood veteran Tom Stern, the battle is pure, pitiless chaos, an unflinchingly graphic look at the split-second randomness of who stays alive and who is savagely cut down.
 
  Compared with this brutality, the two flag-raisings that took place on Iwo Jima's Mt. Suribachi (the film is careful to explain this often misunderstood situation) ended up being no big deal at all, mundane moments that were the equivalent, as one of the survivors said, of "becoming a hero for putting up a pole." But that is precisely what happened.
 
  It happened because no one counted on the torrential impact of that photograph, which, among other things, ended up on 150 million postage stamps. The trio of surviving flag-raisers are air-lifted back to the States, in Hayes' case very much against his will, and in effect press-ganged into an extensive public relations tour to raise that much-needed money.
 
  The bulk of "Flags of our Fathers" cuts back and forth between the tour and the men's flashbacks to the hellacious combat on Iwo, detailing the reality the survivors are haunted by, a reality that makes them powerfully uncomfortable with being lionized for their connection to what they consider to be a misleading picture.
 
  This conflict between the reality of the flag-raising and the image the government insisted on projecting for its own needs (a conflict that including refusing to correct a misidentification of one of the dead flag-raisers) is the "Flags of Our Fathers" theme that resonates most pointedly today.
 
  It is interesting to note, in this age of the overblown Jessica Lynch story and President Bush's "Mission Accomplished" aircraft carrier speech, that the need to create media heroes and the determination to use war for political/governmental purposes has hardly gone away. The war in Iraq was likely not high on anyone's mind when this film was conceptualized, but the echoes of the current conflict turn out to be inescapable.
 
  Also inescapable is the wonderful appropriateness of having this thoughtful and disturbing meditation on the qualities that make up heroism and the quixotic nature of fame come from a man who made his considerable reputation playing clean-cut heroes.
 
  As he did in "Unforgiven," "Mystic River" and "Million Dollar Baby," Eastwood handles this nuanced material with aplomb, giving every element of this complex story just the weight it deserves. The director's lean dispassion, his increased willingness to be strongly emotional while retaining an instinctive restraint, continues to astonish. We are close to blessed to have Eastwood still working at age 76 and more fortunate still that challenging material like "Flags of Our Fathers" is what he wants to be doing.

  In general release.   

Stark in its valor, graphically alive in its pose of action, the famous photograph of five Marines and a Navy corpsman raising the U.S. flag on Mount Suribachi, one of the crests of Iwo Jima, exerts such a singular and iconic power that almost anyone could come up with a different explanation for what remains so stirring about it. The position  of the men  that crouch wrenching upward  is a perfect metaphor for the crucial last gasp of American will that pushed the nation to victory at the end of World War II. And, of course, the fact that you can't see any of the men's faces incarnates the selflessness of their mission. They are individuals who, by implication, could be anyone; they are soldiers fused and transformed into a straining human statue that becomes, in an instant, timeless. As they lift the flag, all of us lift the flag. And that is America  or, at least, that is its promise.
In Flags of Our Fathers , director Clint Eastwood pays homage to the physical and spiritual force of that photograph. At the same time, he wants us to know that everything about the image  how it was created, how it inspired people, what went on in the hearts and minds of the soldiers before and after the photo was taken  is less a reality than a mythology, a concoction, a telling, even tragic example of how we, as Americans, are always too eager to overlook the truth and print the legend.
Shot by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal on Feb. 23, 1945, a mere 5 days into the crucial 36-day battle to take the forbidding black-sand Japanese island (which proved to be a tipping point in the Pacific campaign), the photograph entered the national bloodstream virtually overnight, spreading to people through newspapers and other reprints. Eastwood sets his film in two different worlds, cutting back and forth between the Battle of Iwo Jima, in all its shattering chaos and horror, and the homefront public relations war that gets orchestrated around the photograph, with three of those quasi-anonymous, flag-raising soldiers paraded around the country as heroes. They become shills for war bonds, schmoozing with smarmy politicians and posing next to kitschy sculptures of their famous image in a kind of misbegotten military pop-star tour.
As the movie presents it, the stalwart ''Doc'' Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), the lightweight dandy Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), and the courageous, turbulently troubled Native American Ira Hayes (Adam Beach) all, to a greater or lesser degree, chafed at their roles. They knew they were selling themselves  and, in the process, reducing the gritty bravery of their fellow soldiers to a wall poster, a user-friendly parody of itself. In Flags of Our Fathers , Eastwood is here to tell us that the reality of World War II was scarier and darker than any inspirational photograph. He comes close to saying that the war had no ''heroes,'' just frightened young men straining to survive.
Eastwood pounds us with that message, over and over again. The trouble is, he's preaching to the choir  or, at least, to a culture, profoundly influenced by Tom Brokaw's The Greatest Generation  and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan , that has already absorbed the lesson that ''the Good War,'' while it may have been noble, was never less than hell. I think it's fair to say that most of us are past the point of thinking of the soldiers who fought in WWII as plaster saints, yet Flags of Our Fathers , an honorable and rather plodding movie, insists on demythologizing what no longer needs to be demythologized.
The battle sequences, shot with a desaturated, nearly black-and-white clarity in Iceland, and with an added layer of CGI, evoke Saving Private Ryan , and that's a problem: The rawness of the action holds us, yet Eastwood never approaches  Spielberg's mesmerizing logistical virtuosity, his revelations of blood and terror. Inevitably, the heart of the movie shifts Stateside. Yet here too, Flags of Our Fathers  offers more earnestness than urgency. I never felt we were truly getting to know the three soldiers outside of their awkward PR juggernaut. Phillippe's Doc is crucially underwritten, and Bradford never gets past a certain self-contained smoothness, though Adam Beach, the star of Smoke Signals , digs deep into Ira Hayes' tormented, drunken ambivalence about his role as a symbol. His lacerating performance suggests what Flags of Our Fathers , with a less didactic historical focus, might have been: an investigation into the everyday lives of American soldiers who  saved the world but never knew what to do with the agonies they carried home with them.

 Correction Appended  It seems hard to believe there is anything left to say about World War II that has not already been stated and restated, chewed, digested and spat out for your consideration and that of the Oscar voters. And yet here, at age 76, is Clint Eastwood saying something new and vital about the war in his new film, and here, too, is this great, gray battleship of a man and a movie icon saying something new and urgent about the uses of war and of the men who fight. “Flags of Our Fathers” concerns one of the most lethal encounters on that distant battlefield, but make no mistake: this is also a work of its own politically fraught moment.  The film distills much of the material covered in James Bradley and Ron Powers’s affecting book of the same title about the raising of the American flag during the battle for Iwo Jima. Mr. Bradley’s father, John Bradley, nicknamed Doc and played by an effectively restrained Ryan Phillippe, was one of six men who helped plant the flag (it was the second planted that day) on the island’s highest point on the fifth day of the monthlong American offensive. An Associated Press photographer, Joe Rosenthal, immortalized the moment, and American politicians seized the day, sending the three surviving flag raisers  —  Doc, Ira Hayes (Adam Beach, delivering heartbreak by the payload) and Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford)  —  on a hugely successful war-bond drive.  Collectively hailed as heroes from sea to shining sea, Rene embraced the spotlight, Doc settled into stoic unhappiness, while Ira, a Pima Indian shattered by Iwo Jima and its dead, sobbed and drank himself into oblivion. The efforts of Doc’s adult son (Tom McCarthy) to tell his father’s story years later give the film its scaffolding, but it is Mr. Beach’s Ira, with his open face and vulnerability, who haunts it. Tears mixing with booze, he floods his scenes with raw emotion that serves as a rebuke to gung-ho fictions like “Sands of Iwo Jima,” a 1949 bad joke in which John Wayne hands an American flag to the real Ira, Doc and Rene so they can raise Old Glory once more, this time over the sands of Southern California.  Mr. Eastwood’s cinematic deconstruction takes a considerably darker view of the historical record. The Air Force had repeatedly bombed Iwo Jima before the American landing on Feb. 19, 1945; by D-Day, barely a blade of grass survived, even as more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers remained dug in. To replicate that scorched earth, Mr. Eastwood drains much of the color from the film’s already muted palette, so much so that many of the scenes on the island look as if they were shot in black and white. It seems impossible that anything living could survive long in this charred, spooky place, and it isn’t long after the invasion that American bodies begin piling up amid the orange-red explosions and dull-red sprays of blood.  During these anxious moments, Mr. Eastwood characteristically keeps his sights (and ears) on the troops and the choreographed chaos of their movements; the focus remains on them, not the filmmaking. When the men hit the shore, the cameras stick close to them, moving and then, during a sudden hailstorm of bullets, running alongside the men as if similarly searching for cover. Despite the occasional bird’s-eye view that underscores the staggering scale of the operation  — the hundreds of boats hugging the coast, the thousands of men dotting the land  —  the filmmaking retains a devastating intimacy,  as in a quiet shot of dead soldiers lying facedown on the beach, the water under their bodies receding as if it were blood.  The scenes on Iwo Jima are harrowing, borderline surreal, and even after Doc, Ira and Rene leave the island, they never fully escape it. During the bond drive, the pop of a camera bulb, a flash of lightning and the bang of a backfiring car engine instantly return the three to the island and its horrors, a blurring between past and present that, with seamless, ruthless efficiency, Mr. Eastwood and his longtime editor, Joel Cox, turn into a dreadful memory loop. In Mr. Bradley and Mr. Powers’s book, one Iwo Jima veteran describes seeing his dead friends while sitting in class at medical school; the flashbacks, he says, were “like a movie screen wrapped around me.” We see a version of that movie here, and it is terrible.  Most war movies, even those that claim to be antiwar, overtly or implicitly embrace violence as either a political or cinematic means to an end. Few filmmakers can resist the thrill of the rocket’s red glare and the spectacle of death; the violence is simply too exciting. There are plenty of big bangs in “Flags of Our Fathers,” but because the screenplay, by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis, oscillates among three separate time frames  —  Iwo Jima, the bond tour and, less successfully, contemporary scenes involving Doc and his son  —  and because the flag raisers were pulled off the field before fighting ended, the violence of their war remains at a frenzied pitch. It doesn’t build, evolve, recede; it terrifies and keeps terrifying.  What do we want from war films? Entertainment, mostly, a few hours’ escape to other lands and times, as well as something excitingly different, something reassuringly familiar. If “Flags of Our Fathers” feels so unlike most war movies and sounds so contrary to the usual political rhetoric, it is not because it affirms that war is hell, which it does with unblinking, graphic brutality. It’s because Mr. Eastwood insists, with a moral certitude that is all too rare in our movies, that we extract an unspeakable cost when we ask men to kill other men. There is never any doubt in the film that the country needed to fight this war, that it was necessary; it is the horror at such necessity that defines “Flags of Our Fathers,” not exultation.  In this respect, the film works, among other things, as a gentle corrective to Steven Spielberg’s “Saving Private Ryan,” with its state-of-the-art carnage and storybook neatness. (Mr. Spielberg, whose company bought the film rights to “Flags of Our Fathers,” is one of its producers.) Where “Saving Private Ryan” offers technique, Mr. Eastwood’s film suggests metaphysics. Once again, he takes us into the heart of violence and into the hearts of men, seeing where they converge under a night sky as brightly lighted with explosions as any Fourth of July nocturne and in caves where some soldiers are tortured to death and others surrender to madness. He gives us men whose failings are evidence of their humanity and who are, contrary to our revolted sensitivities, no less human because they kill.  One view of Mr. Eastwood is that he has mellowed with age, or at least begun to take serious measure of the violence that has been an animating force in many of his films. In truth, the critical establishment caught up with the director, who for decades has been building a fascinating body of work that considers annihilating violence as a condition of the American character, not an aberration. “Flags of Our Fathers” is an imperfect addition to that body of work, though its flaws are minor and finally irrelevant in a film in which ambivalence and ambiguity are constituent of a worldview, not an aftereffect. Notably, Mr. Eastwood’s next film, “Letters From Iwo Jima,”  set to open early next year, revisits the same battle, this time from the point of view of the Japanese.  “Flags of Our Fathers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The representation of war and its battlefield atrocities is extremely graphic.

Ambitiously tackling his biggest canvas to date, Clint Eastwood continues to defy and triumph over the customary expectations for a film career in "Flags of Our Fathers." A pointed exploration of heroism -- in its actual and in its trumped-up, officially useful forms -- the picture welds a powerful account of the battle of Iwo Jima, the bloodiest single engagement the United States fought in World War II, with an ironic and ultimately sad look at its aftermath for three key survivors. This domestic Paramount release looks to parlay critical acclaim and its director's ever-increasing eminence into strong B.O. returns through the autumn and probably beyond.

Conventional wisdom suggests directors slow down as they reach a certain age (Eastwood is now 76), become more cautious, recycle old ideas, fall out of step with contemporary tastes, look a bit stodgy. Eastwood has impertinently ignored these options not only by undertaking by far his most expensive and logistically daunting picture, but by creating back-to-back bookend features offering contrasting perspectives on the same topic; the Japanese-language "Letters From Iwo Jima," showing the Japanese side in intimate terms, will be released by Warner Bros. next year.
One way to think about "Flags" is as "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" of this generation. That 1962 John Ford Western is famous for its central maxim, "When the legend becomes fact, print the legend," and "Flags" resonantly holds the notion up to the light. It is also a film about the Greatest Generation that considers why its members are, or were, reticent to speak much about what they did in the war, to boast or consider themselves heroes.
Skillfully structured script by William Broyles Jr. and Paul Haggis throws the audience into the harrowing action of the Iwo Jima invasion as a personal memory that can never be softened or forgotten. But the brutal fighting is eventually juxtaposed with the government's use of the celebrated image of the Marines raising the flag on Mount Suribachi for propaganda and fund-raising, with scant ultimate regard for the "heroes."
Reflecting its origins in the bestselling 2000 book by James Bradley (son of one of the central figures) with Ron Powers, tale is framed around a son's search into the wartime exploits of his father John Bradley, one of the six men pictured raising the flag. The I.D.ing and matching of some old-timers to their younger selves is never the easiest thing to do, and the same goes for getting all the names immediately straight for a bunch of young soldiers wearing identical uniforms and very short hair.
But the camera focuses on a handful of the 30,000 troops that landed on the inhospitable spec of volcanic ash and tufa that is Iwo Jima on Feb. 19, 1945, to dislodge some 20,000 well-fortified Japanese.
Among the men are John "Doc" Bradley (Ryan Phillippe), the only Navy man in a group that otherwise includes Marines: Rene Gagnon (Jesse Bradford), Native American Ira Hayes (Adam Beach), the highly capable leader Sgt. Mike Strank (Barry Pepper), Hank Hansen (Paul Walker), Ralph "Iggy" Ignatowski (Jamie Bell), Harlan Block (Benjamin Walker) and Franklin Sousley (Joseph Cross).
Such is the carnage at the initial landing (the Americans suffered 2,000 casualties that first day alone) that there will be some temptation to compare the scene to current co-producer Steven Spielberg's justly celebrated D-Day invasion sequence in "Saving Private Ryan." But Eastwood does it his own way, impressively providing coherence and chaos, awesome panoramic shots revealing the enormous armada and sudden spasms of violence that with great simplicity point up the utter arbitrariness of suffering and death in combat.
The visual scheme Eastwood developed for the picture is immediately arresting. Perhaps taking a cue from the island's black sand, as well as from WWII's status as the last war shot, from a filmic p.o.v., in black-and-white, pic is nearly as monochromatic as anything shot in color can be. Dominated by blacks, grays and olive greens, cinematographer Tom Stern's images have a grave elegance, a drained quality that places the events cleanly in history without diminishing their startling immediacy.
On the fifth day of fighting, some Americans reach the summit where a great deal of the Japanese firepower is concentrated, and six Marines plant a small stars-and-stripes. Shortly after, a larger flag is sent up and, in an event only shown in the film considerably later, six different men, Bradley, Gagnon and Hayes among them, responding to a photographer's half-joking question of, "O.K., guys, who wants to be famous?," put their muscle behind pushing up the new flag held in place by a heavy length of pipe.
At once, AP photographer Joe Rosenthal's shot became arguably the most iconic image of the American war. No faces were identifiable in the photo, leading to some confusion as to who was even in the shot, and three of them were killed soon after.
But the surviving three are spirited back to the mainland to spearhead a final war bonds drive. Bradley, Gagnon and Hayes are treated like gold-plated heroes everywhere, all the while being confronted by replicas of the flag raising made of papier-mache or even ice cream.
Of the three, Gagnon embraces his sudden celebrity, gallivanting around with his fiancee and expecting great things to stem from it. Already haunted by the horrors he witnessed, Bradley copes in a subdued way. But Hayes, whose story was dramatized onscreen in 1961 as "The Outsider" with Tony Curtis, of all people, portraying the Pima Indian, can barely hold it together.
Feeling from the outset that their participation in the tour is a "farce," that the real heroes are the guys who died or are still out there fighting, Hayes drinks heavily, embarrassing himself while having to stomach the everyday casual racism of being called "chief" or being refused service.
And once they've done their bit raising billions for the government, they're left on their own to put their lives back together. It's not an easy road, particularly for Hayes, who in one moving, genuinely Fordian moment, treks a long distance for a brief visit with the father of one of his fallen comrades.
Given this dramatic, wrenching arc, Hayes' story becomes the heart of the movie, and Beach, who previously played a Native American in the Pacific campaign in "Windtalkers," unquestionably takes the acting honors with it, delivering a full sense of the character's pain and sense of entrapment in an absurd situation. Other perfs are thoughtful, credible and deliberately unspectacular, although Pepper supplies special power as the leader the young men need as they come face to face with the enemy.
The director and editor Joel Cox find an effective and comfortable rhythm for the drama's parallel tracks. Spectacle is by no means limited to the battle scenes; one major setpiece is an enormous rally at Chicago's Soldier Field where the men are expected to scale a large model of Mount Suribachi and plant the flag. Perhaps the most felicitous of the film's many outstanding visual effects is the elimination of the recently built flying saucer-like addition to the venerable stadium.
The film's themes are so thoroughly embodied in the drama as it's told that there is no need for explicit statement of them, which makes the final bit of narration about the nation's need for heroes seem unnecessary. Another minor flaw is a Hollywood backlot look to a couple of Chicago street scenes.
Otherwise, "Flags of Our Fathers" is exemplary in its physical aspects. Combination of exteriors shot on the black beaches of Iceland with CGI work conveys a vivid and comprehensive feel of the godawfulness of Iwo Jima.
This and the forthcoming "Letters" represent the final work of the late, great production designer Henry Bumstead; no one could wish to go out on a better note. Pic is dedicated to him and two others who died during production, Eastwood's longtime casting director Phyllis Huffman and flag-raising photographer Rosenthal.
The director himself composed the spare, effective musical score.

A single photograph, we're told early on in Clint Eastwood 's Flags of Our Fathers , can win or lose a war. But sometimes that photo shows us only part of the story, whether it's the part we don't want to seeslaughtered villagers at My Lai, tortured prisoners at Abu Ghraib or the part we do, with heroes front and center and the carnage out of view.
In Flags , the image under scrutiny is one of the most iconic in American photojournalism: five U.S. Marines  and one Navy corpsman planting Old Glory atop Mount Suribachi  on Iwo Jima  during the fifth day of the 35-day battle. That picture, Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima , helped rally American support for the war, won a Pulitzer for its photographer (Joe Rosenthal ), and made overnight celebrities out of its subjects. But the soldiers didn't feel like heroes, and with good reason.
Based on the bestselling book by James Bradley , whose father, John "Doc" Bradley, was the Navy corpsman in Rosenthal's photo, Flags of Our Fathers  is about the three flag raisers who survived Iwo JimaBradley (Ryan Phillippe ), the dashing and mildly pompous Rene Gagnon  (Jesse Bradford ), and the proud Pima Indian Ira Hayes  (Adam Beach )and how their moment in the spotlight irrevocably altered their lives. For these men were not the first to fly the Stars and Stripes, but rather a secondary team, assembled after the smaller flag erected earlier by a different group was claimed as a souvenir by a naval officer. It was this second flag, though, that was seen around the world, its raisers plucked from duty and ferried hither and yon by wily politicians who saw the makings of an inspired PR campaign. It was not the firstor lasttime that perception trumped reality in the selling of wars to the American public.
According to the press notes, in his later years John Bradley  was plagued by hallucinations and night terrors, and Eastwood's movie unfolds as if it were one of them, flashing back and forth between the charcoal sands of Iwo Jima and the clinking banquet rooms where the flag raisers shill for the war bond effort before patriotic well-wishers. Executed in stark widescreen compositions all but drained of color, the battle scenes are as visceral as anything in Saving Private Ryan no small feat given that Eastwood is 76 this year and has never before directed a film of this physical scale. The landing on Iwo Jima is a master class in controlled chaos, as bullets stream out of camouflaged pillboxes and mortar fire turns bodies into sizzling piles of flesh and bone. But the most surreal, unsettling images come later, when the three heroes are pressed into re-enacting their storied feat as a vaudeville spectacle before a cheering crowd, and when, at a celebratory dinner, they see their huddled likenesses transformed into an ice cream sculpture.
To an extent, Flags of Our Fathers  is to the WWII movie what Eastwood's Unforgiven  was to the westerna stripping-away of mythology until only a harsher, uncomfortable reality remains. But what Eastwood really does is call into question an entire way of reading history, by which the vast and incomprehensible are reduced to digestible symbols and meanings. In warEastwood offers us a timely reminderwho is just and unjust depends on where you're watching from. And to further the point, his next movie, Letters From Iwo Jima , tells the story from the perspective of the Japanese.
With Flags , Eastwood has made one of his best filmsa searching, morally complex deconstruction of the Greatest Generation that is nevertheless rich in the sensitivity to human frailty that has become his signature as a filmmaker. You feel this most in the characterization of Hayes, whose postwar descent into alcoholism and near madness has been told before, in song ("The Ballad of Ira Hayes") and on-screen (1961's The Outsider ), but never with such haunted intensity. Beach's agonizing portrait is made all the more poignant by the film's revelation that Hayes, like the other men who raised the second flag, did show extraordinary bravery on the battlefield, just not in the way for which he was remembered. A picture may be worth a thousand words, but for men like John Bradley, Rene Gagnon, and Ira Hayes, there were thousands more that went unspoken.
