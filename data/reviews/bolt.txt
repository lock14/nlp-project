Bolt
, the first offering from Walt Disney Animation Studios to be entirely overseen by Pixar's John Lasseter (who receives an executive producer credit), opens with the kind of action sequence usually reserved for Michael Bay at his most incendiary. Bolt, a steadfast and loyal American White Shepherd boasting cybernetically enhanced superpowers � heat vision, an earth-shattering superbark, etc. � dodges missiles, motorcycle maniacs, and enough firepower to render lesser canines (say, for instance, Lassie) into so much fluff guts, flees the clutches of the maleficent, green-eyed Dr. Calico (voiced by McDowell) and his two feline fur balls of doom. His mission? Protect, at all costs, his beloved "person," the teenage Penny (Cyrus), and aid in her quest to discover the whereabouts of her sci-guy dad, who has been kidnapped by Calico's minions. It's a truly pulse-quickening and thoroughly audience-pleasing sequence that shows off Disney's new direction in animation (read: more Pixar-esque); it may even be the most exciting action-oriented opening thus far this year. And then � "Cut!" The film slips out of movie mode and we discover that it's all prop choppers, wirework, and just another day on the set of the hit television program Bolt
. The catch � obvious but no less entertaining for it � is that Bolt, voiced with surprisingly few annoying affectations by Travolta, has been born and raised on the film studio lot and truly believes himself to possess those "radical canine enhancements" that his character displays every week on TV. Bolt is completely oblivious of his status as a flesh-and-blood nipper, so when he ends up accidentally shipped from his closed Hollywood environs to "the real world," aka New York City, the stage is set not only for a classic Disney road trip but also for a series of alternately comic and wistful revelations regarding the true nature of heroism, friendship, and love. Accompanying Our Hero on his peripatetic mad dash westward are a pair of Disney's better sidekicks: the cynical NYC alleycat Mittens (wonderfully voiced by Curb Your Enthusiasm
's Essman, who brings just the right amount of cynical world-weariness to the character) and pudgy hamster Rhino (voiced by Disney animator Walton), an excitable, Bolt-obsessed fanboy who rolls through the proceedings in a clear plastic exercise ball. This is
 a Disney film, so there's never any real question regarding Bolt and his friends' ultimate success or failure, but the writing team of Dan Fogelman (Cars
) and co-director Williams (Mulan
) has concocted one of the most witty and often hilarious Disney outings in years. Add to that the beautifully nuanced vocal work from all involved, plus
 some of the most deliriously inspired animation to come out of Disney in years � that opening sequence really does have to be seen to be believed � and the end result is, to quote Rhino, awwwesome
. Who's a good movie? Whooo's
 a good movie? You are Bolt
, you are.


Movies in 3D are usually best at goosing you into spilling your soft drink. But "Bolt," a new animated adventure from Disney presented at some locations in 3D, does more than put fireballs and runaway props right on the bridge of your nose. The format brilliantly brings an audience that much closer to a handful of increasingly lonely, yet contagiously enthusiastic, animals.
Bolt (adorably voiced by John Travolta) is a white German shepherd who's the eponymous star of a hit TV show about a superdog and his spunky owner. (It looks like "MacGyver" and "Inspector Gadget" pressed into a rather dull video game.)
The joke is that Bolt believes the show is real. Its pretentious director (James Lipton, outside the Actors Studio), insists that's what ensures an authentic performance every week, so the Hollywood production has to maintain the illusion. That includes the two cats who play the evil villain's feline accessories and show up at Bolt's trailer to mock their naive costar.
The ruse dismays the show's child star, Penny (Miley Cyrus). All she wants is to take Bolt home, which, of course, would be a violation of the "Truman Show"-like conceit.
This stuff is clever, in the reflexively satirical, self-aware way that many animated films are. It's not until the dog is accidentally shipped off to New York City that the movie lets you in on an altogether more interesting idea: It doesn't want to be that cool. In New York, Bolt discovers that his "superbark" (trademarked, I'm sure) no longer supersonically mows down entire armies and that his shoulder chop doesn't really knock people out. He's just a dog, but one who still believes his fictional owner is in trouble.
Eventually Bolt is drawn into the company of a perilously thin cat named Mittens (Susie Essman) and Rhino, an obese, scene-stealing hamster in a plastic ball (Mark Walton), who recognizes Bolt from "the magic box" and is thrilled beyond words to join the rescue mission back to Los Angeles. The movie, which was written by Dan Fogelman and the co-director Chris Williams, seamlessly combines its action duties (always be moving) with its emotional inclinations (always be feeling). So you understand that each time Mittens has to tell her new friend that he is destructible, it hurts her that much more.
If you've ever seen Essman as Jeff Garlin's obscenely abusive wife on HBO's "Curb Your Enthusiasm," it seems unfathomable that she'd be hired to provide the kind of patient support called for here (were Amy Adams or Ren�e Zellweger unavailable?). But Essman proves as capable a friend as she does a frenemy on HBO, never more so than when Mittens exposes Bolt to the joys of being a dog - his tongue wagging from the side of a moving vehicle is a highlight.
The road trip back to Hollywood allows the dog, the cat, and the hamster to see America, and the montage that takes them west is a heart-soaring sequence set to a "This Land Is Your Land" country-gospel song about homesickness, sung by Jenny Lewis. Not much later there's a funny pair of droll pigeons and a climactic inferno that evokes the wildfires still burning in Southern California.
But that song still played on a loop in my head. It's part of the movie's resounding suggestion that the Hollywood entertainment factory can be an exploitative kind of Oz and that animals, even chatty Disney ones, are happiest when they're chasing sticks.


The antics of a dog who confuses his day job as the canine superhero in a TV action series with his real-life skills is plenty high-concept. But in Bolt   a blithe, digitally animated (and in select theaters 3-D) doggy comedy as zippy as its name—the fanciful premise only paws the surface of what's going on as we sit in the dark wearing plastic 3-D glasses.
The basic story bears the distinctive DNA of the Disney family of dramas. Bolt’s a spunky white shepherd voiced by  look who's talking!  John Travolta. He lives 24/7 on a Hollywood soundstage that he thinks is the whole wide world  his own canine Truman Show  until he's accidentally separated from his ''person'' and TV costar, Penny (Miley Cyrus), and shipped in a cargo crate to New York City. Of course, imaginary superpowers don't count for much in such a sleepless city of caffeinated, mortal go-getters. But never mind. The dog sticks to his belief in his canine invincibility  and in the constancy of his person, wherever she is. (Penny's got a smarmy agent, voiced by Greg Germann, who's just so annoyingly...agenty  as he urges her to forget about her missing costar.) Bolt remains loyal even when hassled by Mittens, a skinny, wiseacre New York alley cat who couldn't have found a more perfect mouthpiece than the one supplied by Susie Essman, the sharp-tongued comedian who berated Larry David so bawdily on Curb Your Enthusiasm . Naturally, Essman plays PG-feisty rather than foulmouthed here. But she projects just the right hiss of mischief. When Bolt believes that Styrofoam packing material is his kryptonite  a mystery element that weakens him  Mittens cleverly endorses the lie.
Well, what with one thing and another, Mittens joins Bolt's cross-country trip to get back to Penny and the city of valet parking. And along the duo's hitchhiking route, they meet up in an RV park with Rhino (Mark Walton), a hamster who, giddy pop culture addict that he is, recognizes Bolt as his favorite TV celebrity. Rhino throws himself into the mission (rolls himself, actually, in his Plexiglas exercise ball) with the gallant geek bravado that is the mark of a superfan. Soon, the three amigos are off, off on a classic obstacle-strewn, personal-growth adventure involving funny mishaps, demonstrations of individual heroism, scary scrapes (that, even at their scariest, carry the assurance that things will turn out all right), episodes of losing hope, examples of regaining determination, instances of heartwarming reunion (oops, did I give something away?), and moments involving other funny talking wildlife that make cameo appearances. The New York pigeons are particular pips; maybe they're related to the flock that helped Amy Adams' Giselle in Enchanted ?
That's the blueprint. But Bolt  impresses on more levels than just the basic  and in our wised-up, self-reflexive pop culture universe, audiences are primed to play along with the movie's sophisticated meta references to Hollywood culture, New York culture, TV culture, and even doggy culture: Look! It's a joke about Finding Nemo , about Hollywood agents, about pitching screenplay ideas! (The bright script is by Dan Fogelman and Chris Williams, the sleek direction by Disney pros Williams and Byron Howard.) In our 21st-century familiarity with the results, we don't give the intricate technobeauty of digital 3-D animation a second thought, taking for granted the subtleties of dimension, perspective, texture, and motion that can be achieved (with the right computer programs); on a regular old night at the movies, we don't blink twice at seeing the most gorgeous visual shifts and adjustments, delicate and thoughtful as an old master's brushstrokes. There's a stunning throwaway moment when Rhino the hamster rolls in his stupid plastic ball in front of his new compatriots, and the faces of dog and cat, seen through the plastic, are distorted as they would be in real life  yet we pay no attention to the army of animation artists marshaled just for that one passing sequence.
Bolt  breaks no great new stylistic ground  and yet it's a sturdy beaut. The cartoon chase scenes are of secondary importance  and yet they're wittier and more exciting than anything in Quantum of Solace . It's a great day in America when the complicated looks so easy, and when we expect smart storytelling as a rule, not the exception.
Director Bryon Howard talks about Bolt

 “Bolt” tells the story of a pampered celebrity — a television action star — who is cast out of his cocoon of fame and privilege and forced to deal with the challenges of the real world. The digitally animated real world, that is, in which the hero, a talking dog voiced by the real-life movie star John Travolta, encounters wise-guy pigeons, a cynical cat (Susie Essman) and a worshipful, geeky hamster named Rhino (Mark Walton).  Since puppyhood, Bolt, in the series that shares his name and the movie’s, has played a genetically altered, fearless supercanine who every week must rescue his owner, a girl named Penny (Miley Cyrus of “Hannah Montana” fame), from the clutches of a dastardly villain (Malcolm McDowell).  Bolt’s performance is effortlessly authentic because he is entirely unaware that it is a performance. Somewhat like Jim Carrey’s Truman in “The Truman Show,” Bolt accepts the reality of his Jerry Bruckheimer-like habitat of chases, explosions and special effects because he has never known anything else. Once outside, he is perplexed to discover that he is, after all, an ordinary dog.  With brisk wit and impressive visual brio, “Bolt,” directed by Byron Howard and Chris Williams from a script by Mr. Williams and Dan Fogelman, explores an existential predicament that it also shares. It is at once a knowing, satirical sendup of the Hollywood fame-and-fantasy machinery and a sleek, expensive product of the Disney-Pixar industrial complex.  While artisanal Pixar touches abound in the exquisitely detailed animation, the story shows some signs of repurposing and committee work. Bolt’s situation is a bit like Buzz Lightyear’s in “Toy Story” — he must learn that what he thinks of as his true identity is an artifact of make-believe — and a lot like Lightning McQueen’s in “Cars.” His circular journey of exile and return, during which he acquires a new self that is a better version of the old one, resembles those of Nemo, Wall-E and quite a few of the Disney princess heroines of old. And, as is Disney custom, Bolt is accompanied, and often upstaged, by a goofy chatterbox sidekick, the ridiculous Rhino, who rarely leaves his plexiglass exercise sphere.  But if “Bolt” — originally conceived by the old regime at the Disney animation studios and refurbished after John Lasseter of Pixar took over — does not quite rise to the level of bona fide Pixar masterpieces like “Wall-E,” “Finding Nemo” and “Ratatouille,” it does manage to be frisky, funny and inventive enough to engage the attention of grown-ups as well as children. Perhaps some of the show-biz jokes will sail over the heads of very young viewers, who won’t understand why Penny’s unctuous agent keeps talking about sticking pins in things (I’m not sure I did), or what that mean lady from the network is so angry about.  But then, such knowing insidery humor is hardly limited to self-conscious HBO shows like “Entourage” or “Curb Your Enthusiasm.” Kids’ stuff like “Hannah Montana” and “iCarly” plays the same trompe l’oeil tricks in a more wholesome context, feeding young viewers the illusion that they can see through the clouds of hype and cynicism that make up more and more of the cultural air they breathe.  What keeps “Bolt” fresh is an unaffected exuberance, a genuine sense of fun, that is expressed above all through obsessive attention to craft. The movie has three sets of talking pigeons, each group embodying a regional stereotype, and while I found the dese-dem-dose New York birds amusing, and their aspiring-screenwriter Los Angeles counterparts downright hilarious, it was the uncanny bobbing and twisting movements of the birds’ heads and the shuffle of their little pigeon feet that raised the conceit from clever to sublime.  Similarly, Bolt is a cute enough little fellow with a winning personality and a nice voice, but his physical gestures and facial expressions turn him into a memorable, irresistible character. The 3-D version of the movie, which will be shown in some theaters, is less devoted to the kind of big effects that throw you back in your seat than to a more thorough and understated expansion of cinematic possibilities.  “Bolt,” in other words, is a real movie — not a great one, perhaps, but a more organic and thought-out piece of work than the usual animated hodgepodge that lures antsy children and their dutiful parents into the multiplexes. It has its sentimental strains, but it doesn’t push them too hard, or resort to the crude, pandering humor of, say, the “Shrek” franchise. Like its hero after he wakes up from his Hollywood dream life, it’s friendly, smart and eager to please. Cat people need not worry — hamster fans will be in heaven, but that’s another story — since there is enough sly, predatory feline humor to keep the thing from going entirely to the dogs.  “Bolt” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some of the early action sequences, and a climactic scene of danger, may be too intense for small children.

An "Incredible Journey" or "Homeward Bound" updated for the superhero era, "Bolt" is an OK Disney animated entry enhanced by nifty 3-D projection. The first inhouse feature from Disney Animation since Pixar guru John Lasseter took over the studio's creative reins, this tale of a canine forced to overcome his superdog complex and learn to become a regular pooch bears some telltale signs of Pixar's trademark smarts, but still looks like a mutt compared to the younger company's customary purebreds. While punchy enough to keep parents amused, pic will probably play best to small fry and, especially with Disney star Miley Cyrus onboard, will have no trouble chasing down hefty biz through the holidays.
Although it seems like a workable notion on paper, onscreen the fundamental premise feels a bit shaky. From puppyhood, Bolt (voiced by John Travolta), a white hound with a black lightning bolt emblazoned on his side, has starred as a sort of Rin Tin Tin on steroids in a popular TV show alongside his owner, Penny (Cyrus). An action-packed New York chase sequence shows off Bolt's skills, as he takes down an army of marauding trucks, helicopters and innumerable ant-like soldiers while sprinting faster than Roadrunner, soaring to enormous heights, stopping vehicles in their tracks and suspending a bad guy in his jaws from a bridge.
All his powers are enhanced for the tube, of course, but Bolt doesn't know this; he's kept on the set or locations at all times to guarantee he believes everything he's doing -- that Penny is actually in danger from the villains and that he can always save the day. So when Penny returns to Hollywood and Bolt inadvertently ends up on the streets of Manhattan alone, he doesn't understand why his customary abilities fail him.
You need to take this canine mental lapse in good faith, which little kids will likely do more readily than their more jaded chaperones. All the same, it takes the entire movie for Bolt to locate his inner real dog, with most of his education coming from wise-girl tutoring supplied by black-and-white street cat Mittens (Susie Essman), an abandoned house pet now reduced to skin and bones.
This being a movie in which animals can speak with one another but not with humans, Mittens spars with Bolt from the outset like a spunky, seen-it-all heroine from a 1930s Warner Bros. programmer, but without that quality of banter.
Film feels particularly flat during the stretch that sees the pair stowing away on a westbound U-Haul truck to search for Penny; their repartee is off-puttingly argumentative, and Bolt's overplayed phobia about Styrofoam proves entirely unfunny. However, things pick up at an Ohio rest stop, where they are joined by Rhino (Mark Walton, providing the pic's best voicing), a roly-poly hamster quite adept at maneuvering the clear plastic ball in which he spends most of his time. Rhino's antics provide welcome comic relief as well as a buffer for the cat-and-dog exchanges.
With Mittens having to explain to her delusional pal that, "Nothing you think is real is real," she proceeds to instruct Bolt in the simple pleasures of being a dog, such as sticking your head into the wind from a vehicle, romping through a sprinkler or cavorting with other dogs. A particularly felicitous passage sees the animals occupying a prefab house being transported by truck, which permits Mittens to instruct Bolt on the niceties of home life while ruing her own lost domesticity.
After a spell in Las Vegas, the journey winds up at a Hollywood studio for an unsurprising action climax that once again mixes fantasy and reality.
One decidedly Pixar-like touch is the deliberate fudging of time period. While the high-tech superhero aspects of the TV show and the Vegas on view clearly define the setting as the present day, the backdrops hark nostalgically back to the late-'50s/early-'60s ambiance of "The Incredibles" and "Cars." Only older buildings are seen in the film's conspicuously underpopulated Manhattan; the Middle America passed through possesses an appealingly idyllic, timeless quality; and even the New Yawk accents of Mittens and a trio of brilliantly animated "Italian" pigeons seem a couple of generations old.
"Wall-E" is also brought to mind, due to the fact that a very large number of the film's incidental human characters, not to mention Rhino, are extremely fat.
Voicings, from Travolta and Cyrus on down, are pro but unexceptional. First-time directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard have both worked at Disney for 14 years in various capacities, and pic's visuals are similarly proficient without inspiration. John Powell's vigorous score adds propulsion and excitement, and the soundtrack includes two new songs, with a Cyrus-Travolta duet, "I Thought I Lost You," featured over the end credits.
Film will be released in flat and 3-D versions, and the latter looked great at the screening caught.

With his blazing white coat and pig-pink ears, to say nothing of the zigzag of lightning cut into his flank, the eponymous canine lead of Disney's lively new animated movie Bolt  looks a little bit real and a whole lot not. That's not a failure of craft: Goofy and sweet like his voicer, John Travolta (though mercifully unaffiliated with strange churches), Bolt is both a regular hound and a celebrity pooch, the co-star of a pointedly surreal action-adventure television series whose production designer appears to be going through a Fritz Lang period. At the sound of "Fetch!" Bolt will overturn speeding cars with his snout, outrun aircrafts that look like giant mosquitoes, and face down the cat-loving bad guy, Dr. Calico (Malcolm McDowell), all for the higher good of protecting his "person," Penny (Miley Cyrus), a mildly funky nymph fully equipped with the habitual spunk of a Disney New Feminist. Egged on by a manic Director (sonorously voiced by Inside the Actors Studio  host James Lipton) with auteur blow-dried into his big hair, the loyal little canine fondly believes that his special powers are real—until a packing accident on the studio lot results in him being shipped off in pink Styrofoam to New York City, where reality awaits by the shovelful.
Poor Bolt! Not only must he outperform Twilight  at the box office this weekend, he's also tasked with reminding the tots whom the Walt Disney Company has bombarded with showy heroics and whizz-bang effects (or at least their worrywart parents seeking positive values) that ordinary goodness will do just as well—if not better. It's no accident that Penny's mom (Grey DeLisle) is plump and maternal and the caring antithesis of a stage mother. Like every other kids' movie coming off the line these days, Bolt  carries two tales for the price of one, both handled by Disney veterans and first-time directors Chris Williams and Byron Howard with wit, grace, and the dazzling craftsmanship we've come to expect from the studio that's hitched its wagon to Pixar. One is a sweetly naturalistic road movie for little kids, in which Bolt, anxious to get back to Hollywood to watch over Penny, rides the rails of America's heartland, learning how to be Everydog under the tutelage of the world-weary cat Mittens (voiced by Susie Essman, who plays Jeff Garlin's implacable wife on television's Curb Your Enthusiasm ) and a fan-boy hamster (Mark Walton), both of whom all but walk away with the movie.
Real trumps surreal: Bolt gets to experience hunger, loneliness, the pain of realizing that his lightning bolt smudges in the rain, the consoling pleasures of friendship, and the knowledge that you don't have to jump through hoops to be a hero. This is standard studio stuff, along with the durable fantasy that the good life dwells not on either glitzy coast, but in the great middle American mass, airbrushed of its supermalls and commercial strips and filled with rolling fields and welcoming RV's laden with scraps for hungry itinerant dogs. Only Brad Bird, with The Incredibles  and Ratatouille , has separated himself from the kid-movie cult of ordinariness and conformity to celebrate ambition and standing out from the crowd.
Is it hypocritical that the grown-up story embedded in Bolt  is a deft, if hardly original, skewering of Hollywood duplicity featuring a ratings-obsessed network harridan, an agent (Greg Germann) who's drawn like an albino Michael Tolkin and will do anything to keep Penny happy and working so he can pocket his percentage, and some well-upholstered pigeons obsessively pushing story ideas? As I laughed my head off, I wondered what it means that children's movies have become the playground for Hollywood's self-loathing. Yet the self-mockery in Bolt  is gentle and affectionate, and there's something touching about the yearning for ordinary life and decency that, to judge by its ubiquity in films for the nominally innocent, plagues those who live and work in the realms of the unreal.
