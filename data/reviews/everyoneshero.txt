"Directed by Christopher Reeve."
Whatever else "Everyone's Hero" is and isn't, the thing that most defines it is this opening credit line highlighting its poignant association with Reeve, who was in the middle of making the computer-animated children's film when he died in 2004.
It matters little that Dan St. Pierre and former Pixar
 animator Colin Brady are also listed as directors and did most of the post-prep work. "Everyone's Hero" is now part of the Reeve legacy -- not only for its creative roots and inspirational themes, but because Dana Reeve, the actor's widow, also worked on the film as a producer and character voice before she died earlier this year. The movie is dedicated to the couple's memory, and their son, Will, also has a small vocal role.
None of the above, needless to say, fits into any star system currently employed by critics. So in moving on to the review portion of this review, it's good to keep in mind that here is a case where reductive ratings are even more idiotic than usual.
"Everyone's Hero" is sincere and heartwarming; sometimes it's funny. And its skillful computer-generated animations can be an eye-catching mix of nostalgic and contemporary sensibilities, as they are especially during a clever train-top chase scene. But the movie's story and dialogue can best be described as simplistic and unsophisticated even for its Little League target audience.
The squeaky-clean, G-rated tale begins in a sandlot just before the 1932 World Series. After striking out (again) in a crucial turn at the plate, 10-year-old Yankee Irving (Jake T. Austin) finds a discarded baseball and brings it home. The boy has an attentive mom (Dana Reeve), but longs for more time with his dad (Mandy Patinkin), who works long hours as a janitor at Yankee Stadium. In the father's absence, Yankee discovers that his baseball can talk.
Right. The ball, named Screwie (Rob Reiner), has a ``field of broken dreams" backstory and a gruff voice that's audible only to the kid. This makes him a handy-size sidekick when Babe Ruth's prized bat is stolen by a dastardly Chicago Cubs pitcher (William H. Macy) and Yankee's dad is blamed. The boy runs away to recover the lumber, save the fictional Series for the Bronx Bombers (in real life they swept the Cubs in '32), and win his papa's job back. Along the way Yankee becomes a slugger himself, with help from the athletic daughter (Raven-Symone) of a Negro League star (Forest Whitaker).
Of course the bat, named Darlin', also speaks (with a Southern accent voiced by Whoopi Goldberg). And Robin Williams gets turned loose as the conniving Cubs owner who orders the abduction of Darlin'. Even real-life Yankees manager Joe Torre chimes in for a few lines before the film's ridiculous end, a denouement that requires suspension of both disbelief and the rules of baseball.
But Yankee's journey is about something more than sport, family values, heroism, and ``keep on swinging" perseverance. It's about honoring a vision. So if it's not in the same league of talking-inanimate-object cartoons as ``Cars," at least we can say it has heart. And that's always more important than stars.

         Outside of trying to drive Barry Bonds totally insane, why would a 2006 kids' movie choose Babe Ruth, a player whose best year was in 1921, to set up as the paragon of baseball perfection, idol of millions and unlikely ally of a plucky young kid named Yankee Irving? Probably because Ruth played in an era that now seems as simple and heroic as "Everyone's Hero" would like the world to be.
 
  A steroid-and-Steinbrenner-free animated baseball fantasy of highly inspirational aspirations, the film was shepherded by the late Christopher Reeve (the director of record, along with Daniel St. Pierre and Colin Brady) and executive produced by Reeve and his wife, Dana, who died in March of lung cancer. This will no doubt cause many tears to flow before the story of Yankee Irving even gets started. Or perhaps before one gets past this paragraph.
 


         






    But the most moving aspects of "Everyone's Hero" will probably be found in its credits. The movie is as old-fashioned as one can imagine, despite its 3-D style and the anachronistic mishaps of its script. (Did kids get timeouts in 1932? Could a baseball have been made out of Seabiscuit, who wasn't born until 1933? Did the Depression feature nonfat mochachinos?) And if you live in Chicago, you may well take offense: The Cubs, a meat-locker's worth of knuckle-dragging Neanderthals, are owned by the nefarious Napoleon Cross (Robin Williams). This non-Wrigley assigns Lefty (William H. Macy), a pitcher of disgusting personal habits, to steal the Babe's bat Darlin' (Whoopi Goldberg), so the Cubs can win the World Series. Deciding which is more ridiculous, a talking bat or the Cubs winning the series, will be up to the individual.
 
  Lefty pulls off his crime, which costs Yankee Irving's dad (Mandy Patinkin) his job. Swept up by feelings of incipient New Deal outrage, Yankee sets out to get the bat back, accompanied by a baseball named Screwie, who sounds a lot like Billy Crystal (actually, Rob Reiner). Yankee eventually meets Babe Ruth (Brian Dennehy), who likes the cut of the kid's jib. Or something equally dusty.
 
  Subtle it is not. Well-intentioned it certainly is. No one but the youngest in the family will care very much about it, though. And they may well be filled with wonderment trying to figure out what this big Babe person is all about.
 
 MPAA rating: G. A 20th Century Fox release. Directors Christopher Reeve, Daniel St. Pierre, Colin Brady. Screenplay Robert Kurtz, Jeff Hand, based on a story by Howard Jonas.� Producers Ron Tippe, Igor Khait. Editor John Bryant. Running time: 1 hour, 28 minutes. In general release.   

In 1932, a kid grandly named Yankee Irving finds a talking baseball named Screwie (voiced by Rob Reiner) in a New York sandlot, and they set off to return a talking baseball bat (voiced by Whoopi Goldberg) to Babe Ruth. Co-directed by Christopher Reeve (who died during production), Everyone's Hero  re-creates Depression-era America with surprisingly agreeable anachronistic panache, but a sassy ball and bat don't cut it as compelling cartoon characters, and the not-so-human humans never quite do either (Babe Ruth looks like Shrek).

 Animated in name only, “Everyone’s Hero” is the uninspired tale of Yankee Irving (Jake T. Austin), a 10-year-old baseball fanatic who finds himself in possession of Babe Ruth’s stolen bat, Darlin’ (a trash-talking Whoopi Goldberg). Accompanied by a wiseacre baseball named Screwie (Rob Reiner), Yankee travels from New York to Chicago and the 1932 World Series, where the Babe is striking out more often than Mel Gibson at a bat mitzvah. Soon Yankee has saved the Babe’s reputation, restored his father’s custodial job and persuaded Whoopi Goldberg to stop talking. Not even a ghostly Patrick Swayze managed that.  Largely indifferent to its Depression-era setting — though the Negro leagues are granted a fleeting mention — “Everyone’s Hero” is even less concerned with the need for enchantment. Screwie and Darlin’ vocalize without back story or mythology. At least when Tom Hanks chatted to Wilson in “Cast Away,” the connection between human and volleyball was clearly understood.  Given that this is the last creative collaboration of Christopher and Dana Reeve (Christopher Reeve directed, along with Colin Brady and Dan St. Pierre, while Dana Reeve provided the voice of Yankee’s mother), “Everyone’s Hero” enters multiplexes already shadowed by tragedy. And while that may not be the best start for a kiddie feature, the movie’s sentimental provenance could earn it a critical pass it doesn’t deserve.

Neither a grand slam nor a strikeout, "Everyone's Hero" is minor-league animated entertainment that should score at least the B.O. equivalent of a ground single before a more profitable playoff as family-friendly homevid fare. Fox release doubtless will generate respectful mention as the final project of Christopher and Dana Reeve, both of whom died during its production. But the toon's target demo -- i.e., toddlers and grade-schoolers -- are too young to know about the Reeves, and pic could be a hard sell to youngsters who aren't baseball fanatics and recognize Babe Ruth only as the name of a candy bar.
Initially drawn to the project's potential as an inspirational tale of against-all-odds triumph, Christopher Reeve managed to complete most of the storyboarding and pre-production work before his death in 2004. Vet animators Daniel St. Pierre and Colin Brady were brought in to complete the pic -- they're credited as co-directors with Reeve -- and reportedly tried to remain as close as possible to the late actor-filmmaker's original vision.
Dana Reeve -- who, like her late husband, is listed as an executive producer -- died of lung cancer on March 6, 2006. During closing credits, the pic is dedicated to the couple's memory.
Scripted by Robert Kurtz and Jeff Hand from an original story by Howard Jonas, "Everyone's Hero" is a modestly engaging mix of broad comedy and nostalgic fable, spiked with a few unwelcome sprinklings of gross-out gags. Phlegm and flatulence are exploited for cheap laughs, sometimes with jarringly off-putting results.
The plot pivots on Yankee Irving (voiced by Jake T. Austin), a Depression era youngster who longs to hit homers like his idol, Babe Ruth, but repeatedly strikes out in sandlot games.
Since Stanley (Mandy Patinkin), Yankee's supportive father, just happens to be a maintenance worker at Yankee Stadium, he's able to temporarily cheer up his 10-year-old son by taking him inside the stadium locker room for an up-close look at the Great Bambino's favorite bat. Unfortunately, Stanley gets fired for this fatherly gesture after the bat -- nicknamed Darlin' -- is mysteriously stolen on the eve of the 1932 World Series between the Yankees and the Chicago Cubs.
Driven to help his newly unemployed father, Yankee sets out to find the purloined bat with a little help from Screwie (a Noo Yawkish Rob Reiner), a talking baseball. Yes, that's right: A talking baseball.
But wait, Darlin' also has the power of speech. (Indeed, she's voiced -- quite charmingly -- by Whoopi Goldberg.) And she's none too happy about being stolen by Lefty Maginnis (William H. Macy), a Cubs pitcher with rather disgusting personal hygiene habits. Lefty does the dirty deed to please Cubs owner Napoleon Cross (an unbilled, and uncommonly restrained, Robin Williams), who figures -- rightly -- that Babe Ruth (Brian Dennehy) will conveniently slump without his favorite bat.
It falls to Yankee and Screwie to retrieve Darlin' -- and return her to the Babe in Chicago -- before the ninth inning of the final Series game.
There's an amusing air of picaresque adventure to much of "Everyone's Hero," particularly while Yankee, Screwie and Darlin' are riding the rails to the Windy City. Pic also earns points for cleverly including a side trip that brings Yankee into contact with a Negro League slugger Lonnie Brewster (Forrest Whitaker) and his adoring daughter (Raven-Symone).
Inexplicably, however, the filmmakers pointedly refuse to explicitly address the issue of segregation in baseball during the 1930s, raising the question of why this subplot was introduced. It will be up to parents to explain to their children why Lonnie doesn't get to play with Babe Ruth, but a 10-year-old (white) youngster does.
Pic gets one of its biggest laughs during a scene where Cubs owner Cross delights in mangling bobblehead dolls of Babe Ruth. The doll is a shameless anachronism, of course, but anyone who knows anything about the 1932 World Series can tell you historical accuracy is not this pic's strong suit.In terms of 3-D CG animation, pic's highlight is a genuinely exciting sequence involving back-and-forth leaps between parallel trains. Overall, though, character movements are something less than consistently fluid. Indeed, there's a conspicuously herky-jerky quality to some scenes. Fortunately, the well-cast vocal talents do a lot to infuse the characters with vitality.
