         Vroom. Vroom vroom. Vrrroooooomvrrrroooooommm. VRRRROOOOOOOOOOOOM. Hey, keep it down, willya? I can't hear the heavy-metal music.
 
  Imagine a motorcycle movie scored by Vivaldi. Now erase it from your mind. The motorcycle movie, needless to say, is a package deal: screaming engines, shredded guitars, super-slo-mo action and kidney-jarring landings. And, in the case of "Supercross," a cast made up almost entirely of sitcom stars.
 


         






    Which is OK, because no one else could have done much with this stuff either, and the movie is essentially an ad for Supercross, a sort of Xtreme form of dirt bike racing in which the bikes fly through the air and a rider occasionally lands on his face.
 
  Plotlines? "Supercross" has a few, none of which have much tread: Brothers K.C. and Trip Carlyle (Steve Howey and Mike Vogel, of TV's "Reba" and "Grounded for Life," respectively) are following in their father's tire tracks.
 
  "Motocross is our life," Trip narrates, using the sport's generic term. "It was our father's dream; now it's ours." Trip is the "crazy" one; K.C. is the more reasonable older brother who gets drafted by the factory team of Clay Sparks (Robert Carradine), whose son Rowdy (Channing Tatum) is the company star. K.C.'s job is to run interference while Rowdy wins races. This does not sit well with the brothers Carlyle. The brothers may be underdogs, but — as sports movies, motorized or otherwise, always insist — their heart, courage and devotion to the game will help them do a wheelie over any obstacle.
 
  "Supercross" is mildly reminiscent of, among other things, the surfing documentary "Riding Giants," in that the filmmakers seem to have an inferiority complex: You're told so often and so insistently how cool the sport is that you begin to wonder why the movie is so defensive. "Supercross" also adopts a documentary style à la "Woodstock," especially during the scenes at the various competitions, which provide ample opportunity to focus the camera on the well-developed backsides of female racing fans. Supercross isn't just for boys, girls. You, too, can be a track groupie. Or, like Piper (Cameron Richardson of TV's "Point Pleasant"), actually race, never be in contention and fall in love with Trip.
 
  Howey and Vogel are pros; they just don't have a lot to do. Vogel gets off a good laugh line when they give him one, but it's rare. Sophia Bush ("One Tree Hill") plays Zoe, the filthy rich law student whose pool the brothers clean during their day job and is the movie's class-unconscious, conflict-free example of the kind of woman attracted to dirt bikers. It could happen. And Hondas will sprout wings.
 
  Ultimately, "Supercross" is an example of how too much of anything will get annoying — including VVRRRROOOOOOOMMM and flying bikes.

Should've kept up with the piano lessons,'' cracks an injured motocross biker from his hospital bed, and for a moment, we get an alternate-universe flash of Supercross . It would be called Ultrakeys , sponsored by Steinway, and set in the world of high-stakes, full-contact Rachmaninoff. Hey, it could work. After all, a brand-encrusted infomercial like Supercross  (bankrolled by a cartel that includes youth-pop merchant Lou Pearlman and sportsertainment conglomerate Clear Channel) doesn't really derive its ''drama'' from the sport it's pimping. Substitute NASCAR, break dancing, or backgammon: It's always the story of a diamond in the rough (Steve Howey), his wingman/brother (Mike Vogel), and the gals (Cameron Richardson and Sophia Bush) who sidecar their own dreams and plotlines to help their guys Win the Big One, while footage fit for ESPN6 unspools. Vogel, a scruffy hipster hobbit, is the standout: As Trip Carlyle, maverick younger brother to Howey's cautious K.C., he passes (on this film's relaxed terms) for a lazy James Dean and lends some limber fun to a venture so clearly boardroom-born.
Amusingly, Supercross  puts up a fierce anticorporate front, lauding the self-financed ''privateer'' over the ''factory'' cyclist. If this is a joke, few will get it; newbies will be too busy decrypting all the moto-jargon. Luckily, the camera, caressing gleaming spokes and toned groupie hindquarters with equal ardor, speaks the international language of trash: Get the girl, win the race, spin some mud in some dude's face.

 Loud, dangerous and, to some, utterly pointless, Supercross is competitive motorcycle racing at its most extreme. Unlike its popular sister-sport Motocross, it is held mainly  indoors on twisty dirt tracks equipped with terrifying high jumps. The event serves as the backdrop for "Supercross: The Movie," a title indicative of the sheer lack of originality found in the latest in sports-themed action movies geared to speed-minded teens (with an attractive, young cast mostly plucked straight from television).  As with most films of this genre, the sport is interchangeable; if stripped away completely, the predictable little-guy-prevails premise remains. Here, the underdogs are the Carlyle brothers, KC (Steve Howey) and Trip (Mike Vogel), who struggle to make a living cleaning swimming pools but have big dreams of becoming Supercross champions. Though they come off as complete dunderheads, beginning and ending most sentences with "Dude" or "Bro," both brothers have hearts of gold - but the similarities end there. Trip is the younger and more adventurous one in riding and in spirit, whose bad temper keeps him from the corporate sponsorship that KC, the safer and less impressive rider, secures.  The ups and downs of the Carlyles' path to glory unfold in such a wholesome and saccharine way that it continually provokes unintentional giggles and eye-rolls, but it is still easy enough to cheer on the likable brothers - helped immensely by the fact that their love interests are not the typical cleavage-baring bimbos who flock to the sides of successful sports stars. KC's girlfriend Zoe (Sophia Bush) is an upper-class brunette lawyer-to-be with more smarts than both brothers combined. Trip's object of desire is Piper (Cameron Richardson), one of the few women competing in the racing circuit, and the more bike- and relationship-savvy of the two. In one of the film's many music-video-like montages, featuring corny songs with ridiculously literal lyrics, Trip and Piper connect in a motorcycle-riding love scene of epic cheese proportions.  Piper's dad (Robert Patrick, supplying the only substantial performance), represents something of a father figure to the recently orphaned boys (or so audiences are to assume; there is never a mention of a mother) and offers to sponsor Trip and eventually KC as well, once KC can no longer tolerate serving as "wingman" to his jerky  teammate, Rowdy (Channing Tatum).  The director, Steve Boyum, a 20-year-veteran Hollywood stuntman and  former Motocross racer, provides plenty of authentic dirt-flying motorcycle thrills, but the film's excruciating earnestness  and clunky script  frequently slow its energetic pace to a grinding halt.

Delivering on half its title, "Supercross: The Movie" is a full-throttle orgy of soaring bikes and revved-up engines, held together by a thin if capably acted story of sibling rivalry. Completely disposable yet rousing on its own crude, testosterone-saturated terms, this noisy 20th Century Fox outing looks to sputter and stall in wide release, although homevid biz, particularly among motorsports enthusiasts, looks more promising. 
K.C. and Trip Carlyle (Steve Howey and Mike Vogel) are diehard devotees of Supercross, an offshoot of motocross racing known for its stadium-confined tracks and super-steep jumps. (Pic was co-produced by Clear Channel Entertainment's motor sports division.)
Making a temporary living cleaning pools around their native Palmdale, the brothers see their fortunes change after a pivotal tournament in Apple Valley, when K.C., the more responsible (if less naturally gifted) racer of the two, wins a lucrative contract with Supercross factory Team Nami.
What starts off looking like a sweet deal quickly turns sour as K.C. finds himself playing second fiddle to star rider Rowdy Sparks (Channing Tatum), a cretinous spotlight-hog with a nasty streak. As Rowdy's wingman, K.C. is forced to fight off the competish but never allowed to win a race himself.
Meanwhile, K.C.'s relationship with his brother grows more strained, as Trip, who's both proud of his sib and disappointed at being passed over, licks his wounds in increasingly volatile ways. With some prodding from gruff racing vet Earl Cole (Robert Patrick, bringing a welcome touch of gravitas), Trip decides to go pro on his own, allowing the pic to offer some wry insights into the life of a privateer versus that of a corporate stooge.
Though they're playing fairly standard types, Howey and Vogel delineate the two brothers expertly, nailing their hotheaded, competitive yet still affectionate vibe. As the more interesting character of the duo, Vogel is especially good, playing Trip as a mixture of reckless goofball and brooding black sheep.
The female characters tend to get lost in a film about a male-dominated culture. K.C. falls for a posh Palmdale girl named Zoe ("One Tree Hill's" Sophia Bush), while Trip falls for sharp-tongued fellow racer Piper (a tart, charming Cameron Richardson). To their credit, screenwriters Ken Solarz and Bart Baker do attempt to involve and flesh out both femmes; at one point, Zoe blanches when someone suggests K.C. owns her. (Still, this is the kind of movie where, after Richardson snaps at someone, "Stop staring at my ass," the camera helpfully supplies a closeup.)
Physical and emotional tensions between K.C. and Trip, compounded by Rowdy and a fourth racer (real-life motocross athlete Tyler Evans), build to a genuinely tense pre-climactic race in which neither the outcome nor auds' rooting interest is predictable. Near-fatal consequences ensue, after which the story quickly goes flat en route to its Las Vegas finale, resolving the central conflict in hasty, dramatically unsatisfying fashion.
While the nature of Supercross doesn't lend itself to fluid photography, the racing sequences, which incorporate actual footage from Clear Channel's events, are energetically cut and easy enough to follow. Riders' helmets no doubt made it easy to mask the stunt work.Unfortunately, director Steve Boyum is unable to get inside those helmets psychologically. A few blurry rider-POV shots are sprinkled throughout the finale to clumsy effect.
Off the racetrack, the pic's grainy interiors are almost uniformly, perhaps deliberately, underlit.

Supercross: The Movie not to be confused with Supercross: The Art Installation is easily the finest good-bad Hollywood  movie so far this year. Not since Burt Reynolds 's Stroker Ace  has a racing movie provided so many laughs, intentional or otherwise. With flat, grainy cinematography and dialogue that has to be heard to be believed ("I love your hunger! You're like a rabid dog!"), Supercross: The Movie  most closely resembles late-night Cinemax softcore, with orgasmic bike jumps in place of sex. Two bickering, pool-cleaning brothers, who love nothing more than talking to each other with their shirts off, discover the harsh realities of the motorbike circuit while restoring their fraternal bond through their mutual love of delicious Papa John's  pizza (no, really). Director Steve Boyum , a former motocross driver, hacks his racing footage to incomprehensible pieces and, from the looks of the meager, jumpy narrative, did the same to the script: Subplots are introduced and abandoned, and a story line about "the mysterious death" of the brothers' father appears on Supercross 's website but not in the actual film. You'll have to look for that in Supercross: The Deleted Scenes.
