Leave it to the British to raise invective to a high art. As a ranking cabinet minister in the brutally funny political satire “In the Loop,’’ actor Peter Capaldi unfurls dazzling verbal ribbons of the foulest language imaginable, thunderbolts of vulgarity that carry the force of precision carpet-bombing.
“Where do you think you are, some [expletive] regency costume drama?,’’ his Malcolm Tucker assails one character in one of his calmer, more printable outbursts. “This is a government department, not some [expletive] Jane [expletive] Austen novel!’’
It’s hard to believe that Capaldi, once the sad-eyed innocent of “Local Hero’’ (1983), is now the wizened, cankerous face of the British political system, but that’s what modern times will do to a man. “In the Loop’’ is that rare film utterly without heroes; instead, it amasses a group of boobs, users, and charlatans on both sides of the Atlantic and asks us to recognize our duly elected and appointed officials. You’ll laugh until you bleed, or vice versa.
A number of cabinet members want a war, as do some of their American counterparts. Other officials want to stop that war, as do some of their American counterparts. War with whom? It’s never specified. Someplace in the Middle East; anything else is on a need-to-know basis. As it zigzags from London to Washington, D.C., and back again, “In the Loop’’ assumes that armed conflict entered into by the Western powers is merely grandstanding business as usual. The motor driving the action isn’t international corporate conspiracy but rather individual greed and ambition. The movie imagines the world of “Dr. Strangelove’’ without ideology: Every man, woman, senator, and underling is out for his or her piece of turf.
In such a world, speaking one’s conscience is the mark of a fool, and so we have Tom Hollander, the fop villain from the “Pirates of the Caribbean’’ series, as Simon Foster, minister of milquetoast, going on a radio show and blandly announcing that “war is unforeseeable.’’ This instantly makes him a hero to the government doves and a loose cannon to the hawks; Simon, with the cowardice of the genuinely nice, spends the rest of the movie trying to simultaneously confirm and retract his initial statement. The upshot, as any follower of public oratory will relish, is total gibberish.
Padding about after a large, milling group of characters, “In the Loop’’ plays like a Robert Altman film with added measures of delight and disgust. On the US side are a State Department warmonger played with juicy egotism by David Rasche, a tweedy antiwar diplomat (Mimi Kennedy), and a five-star general played by none other than James Gandolfini  - Tony Soprano as a gentle warrior peacenik. The movie’s delirious high point is a scene in which he and the diplomat share a strategy huddle in a bedroom during a D.C. houseparty, totting up troop numbers on a child’s talking calculator. No matter how grown-up the characters act, the movie drags them back to the sandbox.
Some of the other subplots are more of “The Office’’ variety  - petty infidelities and humiliating misunderstandings. A young British press adviser (Chris Addison) tries to game his American opposite (Anna Chlumsky) in the diplomat’s office, with results that lead to casual sex and maximum chagrin. The indispensable Steve Coogan turns up as one of Simon’s constituents back in the home district, complaining about a collapsing stone wall with the fervor of Mr. Gumby in an old Monty Python sketch. No one gets away with anything, except those who shout the loudest or eviscerate the most colorfully.
The first-time director is Armando Iannucci, who with Capaldi and co-writers Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell, and Ian Martin formed the creative nucleus of the 2005-’07 BBC comedy series “The Thick of It,’’ on which the character of Malcolm Tucker debuted. Like the show, “In the Loop’’ considers politics an arena of bloodsport which only moviegoers who read the papers, have strong stomachs, and expect the absolute worst of humanity will find funny. Shot in early 2008, it’s a reaction to the Bush/Blair era and is thus already dated in many respects. Venom this cleanly expressed, on the other hand, never goes out of style.

The chattering smarty-pants who ran the U.S. government on The West Wing  are slow talkers compared with the motormouthed and hilariously imperfect power elite in the brainy British comedy In the Loop . As in  The West Wing , public policy, government protocol, and media strategy are at the heart of the matter; the process  of diplomacy is as important (and amusing) a source of dramatic energy as the outcome of all those summit meetings and position papers. But the man in charge of this snowballing political mayhem is writer-director Armando Iannucci  (a crucial collaborator in the comedy of Steve Coogan in his guise as insufferable TV celeb Alan Partridge), so the tone is scads more acerbic than anything that would have been tolerated in the White House of Jed Bartlet and the scripts of Aaron Sorkin. In the Loop  invites its audience to think , and presumes a certain love of Monty Python . Not to mention an appreciation of Dr. Strangelove . Consider the movie  an outgrowth of Iannucci's BBC TV series The Thick of It   an offspring of the great 1980s BBC screwball political comedy series Yes Minister . And consider it a welcome oasis of script literacy in a summer of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen .
The troubles begin when doltish British government minister Simon Foster (Pirates of the Caribbean 's Tom Hollander, always good at conveying twittishness) wanders off point during a TV interview, and in so doing nearly commits Her Majesty's administration to backing a U.S. war in the Middle East. Foster's fumble sends the prime minister's apoplectically irritable director of communications, Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi, master of snarl in a Scottish accent), on an erudite, obscenity-laden rampage of ire that doesn't quit. Foster and Tucker then head  to Washington, D.C., to meet with their dingbat American counterparts, including a  ballbusting assistant secretary of state with bleeding gums (Mimi Kennedy), a wily Army general (James Gandolfini), and a State  Department bigwig (David Rasche) in charge of a secret war committee. Anna Chlumsky does well as a sexy, ambitious aide. And  let the record reflect that Gandolfini wears a chestful of medals with honor, representing Army bluntness at its most Yank, especially to Brits who think that hyperarticulate banter is the Empire's gift to peace.

 It is somehow fitting that the unruly plot of “In the Loop,” a sharply written, fast-talking, almost dementedly articulate satire on modern statecraft, should commence with a verbal slip-up. In an atmosphere of impending military action, as the governments of Britain and the United States gear up to invade an unspecified Middle Eastern country, Simon Foster (Tom Hollander), the British minister of international development, gives an interview to the BBC. Surprised by a question outside his area of expertise —whatever that might be — he declares that in his view “war is unforeseeable.”  This statement, which might sound either obvious or opaque to a casual listener, ignites a minor firestorm in and around 10 Downing Street, since Simon’s words seem to depart from the official line. Offered a chance to walk his gaffe back, the poor fellow only digs himself deeper. Winging it in front of the news cameras, he observes that, while peace is of course a desirable state of affairs, it is sometimes necessary to climb “the mountain of conflict.”  The genius of “In the Loop,” directed by Armando Iannucci and written by a crack team of British wits, is that it turns this mountain into a series of festering molehills. War is a deadly and consequential business. That much goes without saying, and when some of the motley technocrats and would-be statesmen who populate this film do say it, their words sound either embarrassingly tinny or patently self-serving. And that’s the point: Grave matters involving global power cannot finally be separated from the pettiness of democratic governance, which is impelled by careerism, vanity, moral compromise and, in London more than in prim Washington, by ear-singeing profanity.  If Anglo-Saxon epithets were armaments, Britannia would rule the waves, thanks to the uncivil tongue of Malcolm Tucker, a powerful press officer. Almost nothing he says  can be quoted here. Loosely based on Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s press secretary, and played by Peter Capaldi as a wiry dervish of Scottish hostility, Malcolm is so completely cynical that he attains a kind of integrity and thus becomes both the film’s chief monster and the closest thing it has to a hero.  The American and British heads of state are never named or shown, and no rogue nation or political party is ever mentioned, but the real-world template for “In the Loop” is easy enough to identify. The British-American push to war involves dubious, possibly cooked intelligence, and voices of dissent inside both governments are silenced and suborned.  But though it all sounds very 2003, the film’s insights are less topical than procedural. It’s not about something that happened but rather about the way things work. Using a mock-vérité style familiar from television shows like “The Office” (and his own series, “The Thick of It,” in relation to which this film is somewhere between spinoff and stepchild), Mr. Iannucci maps the queasy interpersonal power games at the heart of any political endeavor. The inhabitants of his universe  are in essence well-connected cubicle rats, or junior high school clique members with media access and large standing armies, or perhaps Renaissance courtiers with BlackBerrys and power suits.  They are all hellbent on humiliating, destroying or using one another. But of course all of them — the smooth-faced aides, the preening deputies, the ciphers and backstabbers and the snarling press secretaries who seem to run the whole show — are allies, colleagues and in a few cases, lovers. A journalist’s voice is sometimes heard squawking on the other end of a phone line, and a single significant member of the public at large materializes in the person of Steve Coogan, but otherwise the entire menagerie is, as the picture’s title implies, on the inside and on the same side.  Every house, needless to say, is divided against itself. The hapless Simon is pulled this way and that by two rival underlings, the sharp-tongued Judy (Gina McKee) and the deceptively guileless Toby (Chris Addison). Their  boss is also sucked into a power struggle between two opposing state department honchos, Karen Clark (Mimi Kennedy), who wants to slow down the rush to war, and Linton Barwick (David Rasche), who wants to speed it up. Karen and Linton have a pair of antagonistic aides, Chad (Zach Woods) and Liza (Anna Chlumsky), eager young things already adept at smiling, collegial knife work.  The plot is as intricate and elegant as a computer circuit board, though at times it looks more like a tangle of crossed wires. The short summary is that everybody betrays everybody else, that opportunism trumps idealism and that telling the truth is a matter of tactical calculation rather than  ethical imperative. The principal doves — Karen and a sensitive Pentagon general played by James Gandolfini — are as puffed up and shabby as the hawks. Nobody’s motives are pure, and when it’s all sorted out, the killing will start.  The audience, meanwhile, is likely to die laughing. While “In the Loop” is a highly disciplined inquiry into a very serious subject, it is also, line by filthy line, scene by chaotic scene, by far the funniest big-screen satire in recent memory. The hand-held camera work, the hectic jump-cuts and the grubby visuals may  resemble television, but the restless pacing and drab  appearance serve a clear aesthetic purpose. The film visits some of the world’s great monuments to liberty and order on both sides of the Atlantic — 10 Downing Street, the White House, the United Nations headquarters — and they’ve never looked worse, as if shot through a filter made of grime.  And at the end you may feel a little unclean, which is also evidence of Mr. Iannucci’s satirical rigor. The people in whose hands momentous decisions rest are shown — convincingly and in squirming detail  — to be duplicitous, vindictive, small-minded and untrustworthy.

Reprising the corrosive satire of their BBC skein �The Thick of It� on a grander scale, helmer Armando Iannucci and his co-scribes hatch a feverish, sometimes hilarious fiction about behind-the-scenes Brit and U.S. political skirmishes just  before the Iraq invasion in �In the Loop.� The pic will delight fans of acerbic contempo Brit humor, though sans offshore marquee names (�Soprano� James Gandolfini aside) it might struggle to lure auds theatrically. And the constant flow of colorful profanity means this won�t be hitting PBS anytime soon.
Some fumbling radio interview comments by minister of international development Simon Foster (Tom Hollander) sends the P.M.�s director of communications Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi) into a (typical) apoplectic rage. 
The minister�s vague statement �war is unforeseeable� hits a wrong note just when 10 Downing Street is trying to downplay the seeming imminence of an Iraq invasion on one hand, and its ready support for America in that endeavor on the other. Suddenly this timorous politico is thrust onto the national stage, his every word analyzed for hints of which way the wind blows. Also suffering the indiscriminate brunt of Malcolm�s expletive-riddled critiques is Simon�s own coolly managerial communications director Judy (Gina McKee). She gets a rival -- and Simon an ally -- in his newly arrived political adviser Toby (Chris Addison). 
When Simon gets quoted everywhere for continuing to say the ambiguously wrong thing, he is packed off with Toby to Washington, D.C. There, waspish assistant secretary for diplomacy Karen Clarke (Mimi Kennedy) views him as a possible tool in her attempt to slow the war machine.
Once in D.C., the alliances start to add up, from dovish Liza (Anna Chlumsky), who also happens to be a former college flame of Toby�s; to Pentagon bigwig Gen. Miller (Gandolfini), an old flame of Karen�s; to hawkish State Dept. honcho Linton Barwick (David Rasche).While the jittery hand-held cam at first over-resembles an �Office� episode, the spiraling complications, back-stabbings and absurdities soon lend �Loop� its own distinctive flavor.
Peripheral characters adding to the manic fun include Zach Woods� venomously ambitious State Dept. flunky, and Steve Coogan as a pain-in-the-butt constituent. Capaldi is an undeniable standout as white-hot-tempered Malcolm, though arguably he gets to be too much of a good thing, especially once Paul Higgins turns up as an identically raging Scotsman.
Screenplay full of quotable quips and the direction occasionally approach smartass overload. And, truth be told, the ultimate point isn�t all so deep. But intelligent political satire this expertly acted is nothing to sneeze at; �W.� could have used a little more of its hurtling astringency. 
Tech/design package is aces in a quasi-verite mode.


A thinly veiled spoof of Anglo-American diplomatic blundering and maneuvering in the lead-up to the second Iraq  war, British-TV vet Armando Iannucci 's first film reminds us that loose lips don't just sink ships—they also launch them. In  the  Loop , an acidly funny satire about politics and pomposity, shows that language is more than a virus: It's a pandemic and a heat-seeking missile. The zing and sting of the film's dialogue harks back to screwball comedy, but the frequent flourishes of profanity throughout suggest its own genre: screw-you -ball. In the Loop  may be the only film in which grammatical mood serves as a plot point: "Take out the conditional. I want declarative sentences!" barks a spin-doctor to a flunky.
An expansion of the BBC Four  series The Thick of It,  which Iannucci created and ran for six episodes plus two specials from 2005 to 2007, In the Loop  includes a few of the program's regulars, notably Peter Capaldi , reprising his role as Malcolm Tucker , the demon-eyed, ninja-tongued director of communications for the Prime Minister. ("Fuckitty-bye!" is a favored departure line.) In the first of many bravura rage spirals, Tucker goes apoplectic after whimpering Minister for International Development Simon Foster (Tom Hollander ), in the middle of a radio interview about combating dysentery in developing nations, makes the seemingly benign comment that the possibility of a U.S. war in the Middle East is "unforeseeable." From diarrhea to logorrhea: Reamed out, Foster—aided by his newly arrived, wormy political adviser, Toby (Chris Addison , another Thick  vet)—will preen, posture, recant, and bumble to placate his rabid Scot superior and ingratiate himself with visiting delegates from the U.S. State Department , serving up this word salad: "To walk the road of peace, sometimes you have to climb the mountain of conflict."
From there, the film zig-zags between the hot spots of blather: 10 Downing Street , the power corridors of D.C., and the U.N. , with a brief stop in Northampton , where the grandstanding Foster must deal with micro-local politics, fobbing off to Toby the complaint of a constituent (Steve Coogan , barely recognizable) about a crumbling wall. Shot, like The Thick of It,  with zooming hand-held cameras to give a vérité feel, In the Loop  becomes even more piquant with its real-life analogues, who vary in degrees of transparency. Tucker is clearly modeled on Alastair Campbell , Tony Blair 's director of communications and strategy; James Gandolfini 's dovish bear General Miller loosely suggests Colin Powell , much like cuss-averse State Department war-lover Linton Barwick  (David Rasche ) calls to mind a more hirsute Donald Rumsfeld .
Iannucci, who co-wrote the script with Thick -ers Jesse Armstrong, Simon Blackwell , and Tony Roche , encouraged improvisation here,  as he did for his TV show. Cast and crew offer a master class on how to do things with words, capturing with razor-sharp precision the maddeningly empty rhetoric of bureaucracy, the passive-aggressive badinage of territorial co-workers (brilliantly performed by Addison and Gina McKee  as Judy, another aide to Foster), the pathetic feints of two-timing boyfriends, the eviscerating effect of linguistically deft insults, U.S.-U.K. misunderstandings, and, most accurately (and terrifyingly), the government's use of an Orwellian lingua franca to obfuscate diabolical goals (as a cover, Barwick's war group is called the Future Planning Committee). Not to detract from the pleasure of watching the consistently excellent actors, who enhance the dialogue's bite with their body language, but the script of In the Loop  is so rich that it could work as a radio play.
Many have compared In the Loop , which premiered at Sundance in January, favorably to Dr. Strangelove— a film that was released 45 years ago. A more recent point of reference is another movie that ended with the run-up to the Iraq War: Oliver Stone 's W. , a psychobiography that strained for satire but whose wildly inconsistent tone settled most often for hammy aping. Words were mere ventriloquism. Should we learn British as a second language? With few exceptions (notably The Hurt Locker ), most U.S. films about Iraq have been soggy melodramas trafficking in the imprecise discourse of emotions. Though hilarious, In the Loop  is also a horror movie, its lacerating satire constantly reminding us of the all-too-real consequences of distorted, manipulated, and vitiated language.
