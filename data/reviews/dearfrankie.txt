By all rights, ''Dear Frankie" should be unbearably sentimental bilge. That's certainly how it comes across in the trailers. But this wee Scottish drama takes a mawkish premise and, by playing its cards close to the vest, imbues it with quiet, careworn dignity. The movie's still shameless; the difference is you don't mind.
Director Shona Auerbach, making her feature debut, is clever enough to understand that characters we have to meet halfway are always more interesting than those who throw themselves at us. Thus we're introduced to Lizzie Morrison (Emily Mortimer), a pretty but dour single mother restlessly moving from one town to the next around the Glasgow area. She's fleeing from the knowledge that she might be entitled to a little happiness, and in her wake she drags her ornery old Mam (Mary Riggans) and her 9-year-old boy, Frankie (Jack McElhone).
Frankie wants a dad, badly, and since the real one isn't available for reasons I'll not spoil, Lizzie has made up a father out of whole cloth. This make-believe Da is a sailor on the H.M.S. Accra, and he sends Frankie letters from around the world, with colorful stamps that go into a collection book while flagged pins go into the tattered Mercator map on Frankie's bedroom wall. It's only a matter of time, of course, before the boy will recognize his mother's handwriting.
Before that can happen, crisis looms: The ship is coming to port, and mother must provide a father or the jig is cruelly up. So she hires a total stranger and coaches him in all things Frankie. Now, if this were a studio film, the Stranger (which is how he's billed in the credits) would be played by Richard Gere or maybe Mark Ruffalo if we were lucky. This being a deceptively small British movie, we get Gerard Butler, in the first of what will doubtless be many karmic atonements for playing the Phantom in the most recent ''Phantom of the Opera."
I don't have to spell things out for you. ''Dear Frankie" acknowledges that this terse, handsome fellow is too good to be true and then dares us to scoff. Auerbach gives us a glum and economically prostrate Scotland that still seems flooded with beautiful afternoon light, and she has the novel idea to insist that fairy tales are possible, maybe even deserved. Certainly the wary wooing of Lizzie and the Stranger -- one step forward, three steps back -- flies in the face of what seems like a national distrust in happy endings.
There are complications, and there are ham-handed bids for our sympathy that a more seasoned filmmaker might have avoided. Frankie, for one thing, is deaf. He's a deadpan little lip reader, and the movie thankfully gives him some school chums for whom his affliction is just a personal quirk, like left-handedness. But the only reason he's deaf in the first place is so that our hearts will go out to him.
Then there's the soundtrack music: Alan Heffes's piano-driven original score and sensitive rock ballads by the likes of Damien Rice. They make for explicitly lovely movie music, and there's the problem -- you can feel it hustling your emotions this way and that.
Yet ''Dear Frankie" continually stops short of dumping the full load in our laps, and the denouement is both unexpected and gratifyingly slight. Auerbach gives Mortimer enough space to show how a woman might become a bad mom for very good reasons, and she lets McElhone be a kid, albeit one with the solemnity that comes from round-the-clock yearning. The Stranger remains a contrivance, but he's one you warm to, just as this innocently calculated movie comes to life in spite of its machinations. Audiences deserve fairy tales, too, and this one delivers.


         "Dear Frankie" stars Emily Mortimer as a single mother who creates a make-believe dad to compensate for the one her 9-year-old son has already got. Lizzie (Mortimer), Frankie (Jack McElhone) and her mother, Nell (Mary Riggans), have been running from the abusive Davey (Cal Macaninch) for years, but Lizzie has been telling Frankie that his father is a sailor on board a ship called the Accra. And Frankie has been plotting his "da's" course on the world map above his bed for years, according to the stamps on the letters he regularly receives from him. What Frankie doesn't know, or doesn't let on if he does, is that the letters are written by Lizzie, who explains away their Scottish postmarks by saying they pass through a mail depot in Glasgow.
 
  Nell wants Lizzie to tell Frankie the truth, especially because the actual Accra will be docking at Greenock, where they live, in a few days. Frankie has bet a schoolmate his entire international stamp collection that his father will make it to his football tryouts, and a desperate Lizzie enlists her friend Marie (Sharon Small) to help her find a man willing to pose as the boy's father for a day. Marie comes through, and one day Frankie finds a handsome, if somewhat uncomfortable, stranger bearing a colorful book on marine life sitting in his kitchen.
 


         






    With her lank brown hair, sad eyes and rangy frame, Mortimer is a natural for this kind of role — the tough but vulnerable single mom perennially clad in boiled wool. She is so convincing in the part that it's easy to forget how adept she is at transformation (she played a glamour-girl socialite in "Bright Young Things" and an insecure actress in "Lovely and Amazing"). Mortimer is capable of a quick, secret intimacy that makes her especially believable as the single mother of a deaf child with whom she communicates with her own mix of sign language and gestures. Riggans' Nell is by far the saltier of the two — she smokes and carps and worries about the dream world Lizzie has created for Frankie. In some lights she looks a little like Anne Meara, and you half expect her to say something horribly inappropriate at just the right time.
 
  Directed by Shona Auerbach and written by Andrea Gibb, "Dear Frankie" nestles comfortably in that Scottish-Celtic niche of cozy, overcast, working-class fairy tales that seem to smell faintly of fried fish and beer. Gerard Butler, who was young Christine's aristo-lover in "The Phantom of the Opera," plays the stranger who pretends to be Frankie's dad, though he's appropriately scuffed and stubbly-faced here. Despite his salty-dog appearance (he looks as if he walked out of a J. Crew catalog), the man is about as hard-boiled as a marshmallow — within 12 hours he's wondering out loud how Frankie's father could have left the two of them and lobbying hard for a second day en famille
.
 
  Not that "Dear Frankie" aspires to any kind of hardened realism. On the contrary, it caters to a particular type of Anglophile fantasy, the kind where the china doesn't match and the chintz is dingy, but people look out for one another and love sprouts easily in the humidity. As a boy cut off, to some degree, from the world around him, McElhone is appealingly grounded and projects a certain degree of self-sufficiency that allows him to engage in his mother's fantasy without threat of too much outside disruption. "Dear Frankie's" surprises are few and low-key, but the story wraps up nicely. In that way, the movie is not unlike the fish dinners Frankie (who doesn't eat fish, out of some sort of solidarity with marine life) procures from Marie — slightly soggy and bland, but as warm, starchy and satisfying as a box of fries.

he title character of "Dear Frankie," a heaping bowl of Scottish blarney, is a sweet-natured 9-year-old deaf boy (Jack McElhone) who lives a fugitive existence with his beautiful mother, Lizzie (Emily Mortimer), and his chain-smoking grandmother, Nell (Mary Riggans). As the story begins, the family, forced to move every few months to avoid being tracked down by Frankie's violent, abusive father, relocates to a shabby new home. Frankie knows nothing of his unhappy family history. He was too young to remember his father or the assaults that drove Lizzie to flee. His happiness revolves around bogus handwritten letters written by his mother posing as his devoted but absent father, who is supposedly a merchant seaman on the H.M.S. Accra, a name she makes up. On Frankie's bedroom wall hangs a map on which he meticulously marks all the ports the fictional ship and sailor have visited. A day of reckoning suddenly looms, when Frankie learns that an actual ship named the Accra is scheduled to make a one-day stopover and begs to meet his dad. Rather than revealing the truth, Lizzie desperately scrounges around for a credible impersonator. Only a movie could come up with the dreamboat she finds through a friend to play the role. When the handsome stranger (Gerard Butler), a member of the actual Accra's crew, appears on the doorstep, he and Lizzie make as pretty a picture as Brad Pitt and Julia Roberts. Mr. Butler (the Phantom in "Phantom of the Opera") proves to be Instant Superdad, a rugged, attentive hero only a tad less wonderful than Superman himself. As he warms to his role, his reserve melts, and he and Frankie establish a touching bond. Mr. Perfect and Lizzie meanwhile have discreet eyes for each other. "Dear Frankie" exhibits a modicum of shame. If it were a Hollywood product, it would have pushed the couple headlong into passion. Even though it doesn't, the movie, directed by Shona Auerbach, remains a fraudulent yarn riddled with plot holes and improbabilities and topped by a cynical final twist that pulls the rug out from under the story. This Miramax movie epitomizes the style some critics jokingly call "Miramax porn." The term refers to manipulative tearjerkers like "Dear Frankie" whose sensitive performances, along with a light dusting of grit, allow them to be marketed as art films. This one is clever enough to fool a lot of people. "Dear Frankie" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.
Mike Leigh  spins silk out of shoestrings and Terence Davies  can't even get a foot in the financiers' door, but somehow the U.K. film industry can always scrounge enough loose change from the cushions to foot the bill for a pre-chewed lump of sickly saltwater taffy like the mawkish Scottish-seaside postcard Dear Frankie . Emily Mortimer  (last seen getting a big banging from Ewan McGregor  while covered in custard and ketchup in Young Adam ) plays single mother Lizzie, who's been on the run from her violent husband for years; her deaf nine-year-old, Frankie (Jack McElhone ), has no memory of his thuggish father, and Lizzie eagerly fills in this lacuna with tales of a fantasy sailor Dad on the high seas. When his supposed ship comes to dock at Frankie and Lizzie's latest hometown, quick-thinking Mum recruits the Phantom of the Opera (stone-faced Gerard Butler , credited as simply The Stranger) to play Daddy, provoking many slushy soundtrack cues. The pat emotions contradict the lazily inconclusive life-goes-on ending, and the moral seems to be that kids just want to be lied to.
