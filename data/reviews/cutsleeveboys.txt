         Written and directed by first-time feature filmmaker Ray Yeung, "Cut Sleeve Boys" follows the misadventures in love and life of a small circle of Asian gay men in contemporary London.  Although that sounds like something grounded in a certain specificity, a world with its own particular parameters, the two main characters follow arcs that seem familiar:  Melvyn (Steven Lim), the vain party boy who discovers there is more to the world,  and Ashley (Chowlee Leow), the shy repressive who learns to open up and accept himself.
 
 An opening card states that an ancient emperor, not wanting to awaken his sleeping male  concubine, cut off his sleeve to steal away without disturbing his lover and that, ever since, the term "cut sleeve" has been a Chinese euphemism for gay. As expected, the same thing eventually happens in the film, as a character cuts off his sleeve to depart from an awkward assignation. Encapsulating "Cut Sleeve Boys" in an unintended way, the moment feels strangely like a throw-away, with no added meaning, deeper resonance or even humor.
 


         






   Yeung sets the movie within an exaggerated, brightly colored comic-strip world, which is frequently at odds with his transitions between lighthearted comedy and more serious-minded drama. As one character says, "There's nothing wrong with being camp. It's part of the gay scene." Fair enough, but the film isn't enough of an all-out extravaganza to qualify as true camp, nor is it thoughtful enough to achieve much more than that. The bones of something more interesting are there -- how people come to mentally and emotionally define themselves and the ways in which they often need to realign those beliefs -- but Yeung can never reconcile his impulses toward humor and human conflict, so things tend to sputter about, feeling disconnected and episodic.

No amount of Botox or false eyelashes can rejuvenate helmer Ray Yeung's "Cut Sleeve Boys," which recycles way too many gay cliches. Setting a tired story in London's gay Chinese community doesn't change the fact that the lines have been heard before, while low budget HD simply draws attention to pic's lack of visual style. What's left are attractive bodies, but auds looking for beefcake thrills have plenty of more satisfying options available. 
Closet case Gavin (Mark Hampton) keels over while having sex in a toilet stall. At his funeral, swish friend Ash (Chowee Leow) and callous stud Mel (Steven Lim, even more superficial than Brian in "Queer as Folk") exchange over-arched eyebrows. Ash dons drag to find the right guy, while Mel attempts to ditch buff but clingy country boy Todd (Gareth Rhys Davies). Leow's few genuinely amusing moments aren't exactly fresh but at least hint at a talent hidden here by poorly written dialogue coupled with poor direction. Over-lit scenes eliminate any depth, in keeping with overall tone.
