"Get Rich or Die Tryin'" is the acting debut of rapper 50 Cent. Under his given name, the decidedly non-gangsta Curtis Jackson, 50 plays an abridged version of himself: a Queens-born, drug-dealing thug turned hip-hop icon named Marcus.
On most levels his performance is as flat as his abs: very early Wahlberg.
The movie itself is a solid repackaging of the criminal back story that made 50 famous. Not even the star himself can be bothered to do much more than crack his amazing Kool-Aid smile. He is frequently caught giving his costars looks completely absent of emotional expression. He could be thinking. He could be on life support.
Sometimes, though, it's tempting to see this performance style as sneakily strategic. When he cries, as he does in one late scene, it's like an Old Testament miracle: Water seeps from the stone!
Narrating his own tale, 50 speaks in a babyish mumble only Mike Tyson could understand. In his music, that indistinct mutter is a clever instrument: Even when he's rapping about getting out of jail or plugging a hater, he sounds like he's doing it from the VIP lounge. Lazy articulation suits him there, especially because the rhymes are always helped along by irresistible beats.
But Dr. Dre didn't produce this movie, somebody else did.
One of those somebodies is the Irishman Jim Sheridan, who also directed "Get Rich." Sheridan is best known for making "My Left Foot" and the blistering IRA film "In the Name of the Father." 50's fans won't be disappointed with the filmmaking muscle Sheridan lends to this malarkey.
The story opens with the now-legendary assassination attempt on 50 -- make that Marcus -- then flashes back to the 1980s when he was a 12-year-old (Marc John Jefferies) on the mean streets of Queens. Marcus's mom (Serena Reeder) is a workaholic drug-slinger. His daddy, as he says in the narration, could have been anybody. When she's brutally slain, Marcus follows in his mother's occupational footsteps but never abandons his dreams of rap success.
As a young man, Marcus is determined to find out who killed his mother (he thinks the murderer is a Rick James look-alike) and desperate to know his father.
In the meantime, he joins a big drug family, run from afar by a Don Corleone-like kingpin (Bill Duke) with a smooth criminal named Majestic (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) as the nasty frontman. Following his first taste of success, Marcus buys a coveted white Mercedes-Benz that gleams like a freshly bleached tooth. He also moves into a warehouse and throws parties where each girl looks like a Jet magazine Beauty of the Week.
The usual shoot-outs and double-crosses ensue. There's also a trip to the pokey, where one grisly, naked shower shivving awaits. So does Terrence Howard, who already played a version of 50 Cent's part in "Hustle & Flow." As Marcus's keyed-up manager, he steals the movie.
To soften the fabric, the film throws Marcus a love interest named Charlene. She's his underwritten childhood sweetheart, and the lovely Joy Bryant makes the most of the role. But there's not much an actress can do with a character who scraps her upward mobility and dance career to be the wind beneath a bad boy's wings.
Bad as he is, the movie suggests that Marcus is surrounded by a lot worse. And so "Get Rich" details all that personal history to build back up to the incident that has made 50 Cent an urban legend: Marcus is shot nine times. To win our sympathy, we see his long convalescence. (Apparently, he's not bionic.)
This all seems a bid to clarify 50 Cent's thuggish reputation. But it's not that new. "Get Rich" is an all-American cautionary tale. In one early moment worthy of Edward G. Robinson, Marcus boasts, "I'm a gangsta, Grandpa, and I'm proud of it!"
Still, the movie takes care to show Marcus's betrayers and his boys doing most of the killing. The script is by Terence Winter, who's written several top episodes of "The Sopranos," and he appears to have had a good time turning 50 Cent's life into a collection of movie clich�s meant to produce a myth.
Sheridan seems particularly smitten. The director likes his star immensely and has seen to it that this unpretty man is often exquisitely photographed. (Declan Quinn's jailhouse cinematography is especially, well, arresting.) Sheridan's embrace of urban life here picks up where his previous picture, "In America," left off. He doesn't seem to know he's working with ancient entertainment formulas. The rags turn to riches as if by Hollywood magic. Compared to "8 Mile," Curtis Hanson's fearsome inner-city portrait of the Detroit that produced Eminem, "Get Rich" feels almost fantastical.
Nonetheless, what's really problematic about "Get Rich or Die Tryin' " is 50's amazing grin. It makes the whole thing seem anticlimactic. Before we enter the theater, we know he's a millionaire winner starring in a movie about how he won. So it's hard to believe him when he isn't smiling.
When he is, it's even harder. He looks like he's gotten rich long before he almost dies trying.


         Nothing encapsulates "Get Rich or Die Tryin' " better than the notorious billboard image of star Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson with a gun in one hand and a microphone in the other. It was a bad idea to promote that likeness near schools, but it certainly tells you everything you need to know about the film it advertises.
 
  More inspired by than closely following hard-core rapper Jackson's chaotic life from drug dealer to music superstar, "Get Rich" is a motion picture with one foot in artistic expression and one in pulp fiction and commercialized violence. It wants the respect that goes with a quality production, but it can't resist providing the brutality and exploitation the film's core audience expects. But giving in to its bad side, though likely a shrewd box-office move, robs the film of some of its power and effectiveness.
 


         






    That "Get Rich" has our sympathy for as long as it does is due largely to Irish director Jim Sheridan. Best known for Oscar-nominated movies such as "My Left Foot," "In the Name of the Father" and "In America," Sheridan may have seemed like an unlikely choice for this ghetto melodrama, but he wasn't.
 
  For one thing, Sheridan happens to be a longtime rap fan. More important, the underclass dynamic of America's inner cities is not that far removed from the bleak experience of Catholics in Northern Ireland that is Sheridan's comfort zone. As the director told The Times' Geoff Boucher, "Trouble is the same, despair is the same and violence is the same." Not dazzled by rap mythology, Sheridan is more in sympathy with than in awe of this story's events.
 
  Efficiently written by Terence Winter, an Emmy winner for his work on "The Sopranos," "Get Rich" starts with the most famous incident in Jackson's life: getting shot nine times but living to tell the tale.
 
  As he lies wounded in the streets of Queens, N.Y., protagonist Marcus (Jackson) says in voice-over that he half expects the father he never knew to rescue him.
 
  "I've been looking for him all my life," he says, setting up the film's metaphorical framework. "This is my search."
 
  "Get Rich" is so determined to make us understand the childhood that molded the man that it flashes back to 15 or 20 minutes of it, with Marc John Jeffries as young Marcus, a boy who idolizes his gorgeous drug-dealing mother (Serena Reeder) only to be crushed when she is murdered.
 
  By the time Jackson takes over the role, Marcus may love rap, but he is also so into the thug life that he's happy to say, "I'm a gangster, Grandpa, and proud of it." Following his mother into the drug-dealing business, which soon moves from cocaine to the more lucrative crack, Marcus becomes a rising criminal star dreaming the American dream of money and success.
 
  This is the seen-it-before stuff of 1930s gangster movies turned inside out, with the gangster not the charismatic villain but the good guy who triumphs at the end. A lot of "Get Rich's" situations and lines, like "I had it all but still something was missing," are awfully shopworn, but Sheridan's direction concentrates on teasing the reality out of the overly familiar.
 
  A director very much at ease with emotion, Sheridan helps elicit fine performances from a number of "Get Rich's" actors. Terrence Howard is as seductively charismatic as ever as Marcus' confederate Bama, Bill Duke is appropriately unnerving as the godfather Levar and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje of HBO's "Oz" holds our interest from beginning to end as Marcus' boss and criminal role model Majestic.
 
  Sheridan also does well with quietly charismatic first-time actor Jackson, who is predictably comfortable playing this screen version of himself. As opposed to his hard-nosed musical image, Jackson plays Marcus as a basically sweet guy who lets the audience know immediately, via a wink to a young boy in trouble, that he is not the villain circumstances have made him seem.
 
  This delicate balancing act between dramatic realism and overworked genre material works fairly well for a time. Its first sign of faltering is in Marcus' relationship with his girlfriend, Charlene (nicely played by Joy Bryant). It's never completely clear why Charlene easily and unapologetically accepts Marcus' ultra-violent lifestyle, and she so earnestly stands by him it is hard to accept her as other than a plot construct.
 
  Past a certain point, the brutality that is an essential part of "Get Rich's" story overstays its welcome. The cycle of violence repeats itself so many times, with endlessly repetitive shootings and stabbings, not to mention shots of hot women in various stages of exposure, that the film's inability to resist the lure of maximum exploitation becomes frustrating.
 
  With the audience for things with the 50 Cent brand being so large (this year he was the first musician since the Beatles to have four songs in the top 10 of Billboard's Hot 100), the filmmakers apparently couldn't pass up the opportunity to make "Get Rich" as nakedly commercial a film as possible, couldn't risk losing so much as a penny of its considerable money-making potential. What it lost instead was a piece of its soul.

Finding artistic inspiration is the least of Curtis Jackson's challenges. The massively successful rapper, who goes by the nom de multi-platinum-album gangsta 50 Cent, was 8 years old when his drug-dealing mother was shot to death in 1983; there was no father in the picture. Raised by his grandparents in Queens, young Jackson knew early on that he wanted to be a rapper  this was the era of Run-DMC, after all  but he took to drug dealing as a day job, and got paid. He did jail time. In 2000, he was shot, nine times.
Jackson recovered, and continued to write his experience-based lyrics, never flagging in his confident hustle for fame and, especially, fortune. The grittiness of his résumé, the charming brazenness of his ambition, and the immobile grandeur of his defiant, unsmiling stare impressed rocketing colleague and fellow stoneface Eminem enough to call Mr. Cent ''my favorite rapper of the moment'' and ''the only one keepin' it real.'' And the endorsement changed Jackson's life: A major-label deal followed, along with gargantuan album sales, awards, a business empire, and enough scratch to buy a multimillion-dollar 50,000-square-foot Connecticut mansion formerly owned by Mike Tyson.
Now there's this, Get Rich or Die Tryin' , a rags-to-riches bio-inspired pic with a title taken from Jackson's debut album and high hopes extrapolated from the success of Eminem's own impressive movie debut, 8 Mile . In Get Rich , the man who once declaimed, ''I'm the boss on this boat, you can call me Skipper/The way I turn money over you should call me Flipper'' plays a star-to-be called Marcus from the Bronx (not Queens) hood. He's got a murdered mother, a felony rap sheet, bullets in his body, etc. Eventually he renounces his bad old ways and focuses his energies and battering-ram charms on winning friends (or at least demanding respect), influencing people, making music, and becoming r-i-c-h. The fictionalized version of 50 Cent is also given Joy Bryant as a ladylike girlfriend, Hustle & Flow 's Terrence Howard (in yet another great 2005 performance) as a colorful prison buddy, and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, from Lost , as a mentor only slightly less flamboyantly evil or intimately entangled with our hero's family history than Darth Vader.
The screenwriter is Terence Winter, acclaimed for his work on The Sopranos . The outstanding cinematographer is Declan Quinn, who creates a gorgeously crumbly 1970s Bronx in colors of dirt and blood. The director is Jim Sheridan, who, although less known for his hip-hop cred than for his work with Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot  and In the Name of the Father , has announced himself as a rap aficionado who sees in Jackson's story ''pretty powerful and interesting material to put on film.''
But Get Rich or Die Tryin'  is neither powerful nor interesting. It is (distressingly, as if what the heck does it matter, since 50 Cent sells himself and the tie-in soundtrack album, too) a run-of-the-mill movie ''product'' developed as part of a 50 Cent marketing plan, the opposite in style and wiles of Curtis Hanson's 8 Mile ; it's got the undifferentiated, bring-in-da-noise pacing of a work for hire. It is also, surely, the first movie I've ever seen that incorporates graphic prison violence (complete with an Oz-like naked brawl among showering inmates), graphic make-up sex (more nakedness, this time gauzy and femme-friendly), unrelentingly raw language, and the close-range shooting of the central character, played by a man reenacting his own worst moment in real life  and yet nothing shocks, distresses, or even registers. Which is itself, you know, kind of shocking.
Really, Jackson shouldn't be blamed for this: His 50 Cent persona  the glower, threat, eroticism, and up-from-hell ballsiness of it  works like gangbusters on stage, in music videos, in the recording studio, and at the bank. Not raised to let softness out, though, and not at ease with the free exchange of facial expressions, the centerpiece of the show looks exposed and vulnerable on screen, and not in a good way. He's clearly working hard, approaching his gig with discipline. And yet, under Sheridan's watch, in a production that regularly brings the camera in close on opacity, he's regularly overmatched in two ways. For one thing, the overbusy script, with its many anecdotes to tell (the movie runs a baggy two hours), manages to distract from Jackson's importance in his own story, rather than intensify it. And for another, the wattage of the novice actor just can't match the brightness of his more experienced costars, particularly Akinnuoye-Agbaje and Howard, who are as delighted in and enthusiastic about the men they play, however good or evil, as Jackson appears to be ambivalent about representing himself.
There's nothing at all wrong with wanting to get rich as opposed to dying, but not every business plan requires a feature film to achieve that American gangsta goal.

 "Get Rich or Die Tryin' " is the latest film to propose hip-hop stardom as both an alternative to and an extension of the criminal life. Directed by Jim Sheridan from a jampacked script by Terence Winter, the film is loosely based on the experiences of its star, the glowering, tattooed rapper 50 Cent (also known as Curtis Jackson).  The opening scene is a chaotic armed robbery that ends with Mr. Jackson's character, an aspiring hip-hop artist and successful drug dealer named Marcus, being shot nine times. (From there, it flashes back to Marcus's childhood.) At a similar moment of career transition, Mr. Jackson took the same number of bullets (including one in the mouth that left fragments embedded in his tongue), a parallel clearly meant to bolster the movie's realism.  But in hip-hop, and especially in hip-hop movies, the boundaries between fact and fable are notoriously blurry. Since so many rappers model their personas on big-screen gangsters - "Scarface" and "Goodfellas" are particular touchstones - it is only fitting that their cinematic vehicles should follow sturdy genre conventions. And "Get Rich or Die Tryin' " is an awkward, sometimes engaging blend of two well-worn formulas. It is a follow-your-dream tale of adversity and redemption, somewhat in the manner of "8 Mile" and "Hustle & Flow," combined with an underworld saga of betrayal and revenge - a smoother, more upscale variation on the rough and raucous "State Property" franchise.  As such, it is a triumph of packaging, a carefully engineered product aimed at satisfying the sometimes contradictory needs and concerns of the mass audience. Its violence is intense, but it never crosses over into nihilism because the hero, while unquestionably tough, stops short of killing. The early images of Marcus as a sensitive, fatherless boy (played by Marc John Jefferies) linger as he grows into manhood. And though 50 Cent, in his breakthrough hit "In Da Club," chanted "I'm into having sex, I ain't into making love," Marcus shows a decidedly chivalric streak, and a willingness to commit to his childhood sweetheart, Charlene (Joy Bryant). He is a ruthless thug with a sensitive side. An eager, disarming smile occasionally lights up Mr. Jackson's hard, impassive face, and at one point a tear even falls from his eye.  Unfortunately, that tear represents the far horizon of his range as an actor. As a rapper, 50 Cent has been an overachiever, selling boatloads of records in spite of his pedestrian skills. Lacking the verbal wit of a Jay-Z, the storytelling ability of a Biggie Smalls or the engaging personality of a Kanye West, he has gotten over through doggedness and a certain truculent charisma. That is not quite enough to sustain nearly two hours of drama, however, and Mr. Jackson is an inert, clumsy presence at the center of the movie, which seems to have been edited around his deficiencies.  The heavy reliance on voice-over narration is one sign of this. Another is that the most memorable performances belong to secondary players, including Ms. Bryant, Terrence Howard of "Hustle & Flow" (as a hoodlum named Bama, who meets Marcus in a prison shower), Viola Davis (as Marcus's weary, loving grandmother) and the two heavies, Bill Duke and Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. They all chip in to carry the picture, and Mr. Jackson along with it, to a level slightly above mediocrity. Mr. Sheridan, whose other movies include "My Left Foot,"  "The Boxer,"  "In the Name of the Father" and "In America," deserves some credit as well, for infusing a chaotic story with some touches of warm, easy humanism. This director specializes in stories of dreamers and strivers struggling with adverse circumstances, and he has an instinct for both the loneliness of the struggle and the solidarity that helps it along. The parts of "Get Rich or Die Tryin' " that feel most genuine have to do with friendship and family, rather than with criminal intrigue.  But the movie ultimately lacks an emotional core. It will certainly make 50 Cent even richer, but it wouldn't have killed him to try a bit harder.  "Get Rich or Die Tryin' " is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, obscenity and some sexual scenes and references.

Even though it's inspired by the real life of rap megastar Curtis "50 Cent" Jackson, "Get Rich or Die Tryin'" has the pulpy feel of fictional gangsta melodrama that plays like a contrived cross between "New Jack City" and "Hustle & Flow." Mildly engaging but very far from being for 50 Cent what "8 Mile" was for Eminem, this lurchingly structured story of survival against the odds looks to get off to a strong start thanks to the singer's large following, but is a longshot to generate significant cross-over or the conversion of new fans.
Although 50 Cent is the big story here, the pic is notable as a departure for director Jim Sheridan, inasmuch as it marks his first feature on a non-Irish subject. All the same, "Get Rich" can be seen as something of a companion piece to Sheridan's last film, "In America," in its view of striving against the tide toward vindication and success through self-reliance in New York City.
Violent grabber of an opening has Marcus (50 Cent) and cohorts barging into a Latino-run money laundering office to pull off a big robbery, a fiasco that leads to Marcus lying on the street about to be shot. Narration and a flashback then send the action to the '70s Bronx, where young Marcus (a convincing Marc John Jefferies), who doesn't know who his father was, is being raised by drug dealing mama Katrina (Serena Reeder) with the help of other relatives. 
When Katrina is killed in a turf war, Marcus starts selling dime bags and buys a gun. At a little more than 20 minutes in, 50 Cent takes over as Marcus, who pursues the gangsta lifestyle by assembling his own crew of three cohorts and working under the auspices of local drug kingpin Levar (Bill Duke) and Levar's volatile henchman Majestic (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). 
Intermittent battles with Colombian dealers thin the ranks, but Marcus gets fully into the gangsta life, "gettin' paid and gettin' laid," buying a white Mercedes with cash (but without a driver's license), reconnecting with childhood sweetie Charlene (Joy Bryant) and toying with being a rapper under the moniker Young Caesar.
The life eventually trips Marcus up, however, and he lands in the slammer, where he's rescued during a vicious shower room knife attack by the loquacious Bama (Terrence Howard). In solitary, Marcus realizes he must "express myself or die," and with Bama proposing to be his manager, Marcus begins scratching lyrics on his cell wall.
Back on the outside, life tears at Marcus from every direction: Majestic expects him to return to the fold as an important drug dealer, Charlene delivers him a son, and Marcus and Bama try to get the rap career going. In extremis without a record deal, Marcus undertakes the botched robbery of the opening and proceeds, as 50 Cent famously did, to have nine bullets pumped into him.
From there, it's a story of resurrection from the left-for-dead, of summoning up the strength and determination to forge an American self-made success story that Ayn Rand herself would have been proud of. 
Nevertheless, "Get Rich" spends far more time on the criminal story mechanics than on creating a revealing portrait of the artist as a young man. "8 Mile" managed to convey to the uninitiated a strong sense of what made Eminem tick, the real life elements that fed his work and the circumstances under which he tested and developed his material. (An Eminem-like figure named Dangerous hovers inscrutably in the background of Marcus' story.)
In "Get Rich" Marcus wants to be a rapper from an early age, but what drives him musically (as opposed to commercially) is vague, and insufficient evidence from his work is offered to convince the uncommitted observer of his musical talent. Unlike with "8 Mile" or, for that matter, "Hustle & Flow," there's no moment that wins the audience over to Marcus' artistic cause or, by extension, to the film. One is left with the feeling of having watched an imitation of life rather than something close to the real thing, no matter how accurately the script by "Sopranos" vet Terence Winter may reflect 50 Cent's own.
As a bigscreen leading man, 50 Cent possesses a degree of charisma and appeal. But he can't convey emotional turmoil, the electricity of artistic ferment or a sense of unpredictable danger, resulting in just moderate overall impact. When Howard finally explodes on the scene an hour in, he forcibly reminds what a real actor can bring to a role.
Bryant is smartly appealing as Marcus' sweetheart, while the thesps playing the villains lay it on pretty thick, Akinnuoye-Agbaje with leers and taunts, and the dapper Duke as a hoarse whisperer worthy of Brando's Godfather. 
Pic is dark to the point of murky inscrutability at times, and the overall look is unattractive. Other tech contributions are routine.
Only real performance footage of 50 Cent comes alongside the end credits.

The video game released in conjunction with 50 Cent 's movie is called Bulletproof . The flick itself could easily be called Criticproof . After a pummeling MTV  blitz, soundtrack drop, convenient controversy over billboard guns, recent revelations of murder plots against the candid "Ghetto Quran" rapper, most of Get Rich or Die Tryin' 's audience is coming in well-briefed. The Queens -bred 'In Da Club" hustler's drug-dealing mom was murdered when he was eight; the young 50 (née Curtis Jackson) worked as a narco hopper and a dealer; he dropped out of high school, went to prison, and most famously, was shot nine times in 2000 and lived to rap about it.
Unfortunately My Left Foot 's Jim Sheridan , that reliable purveyor of Irish struggle-porn, anchors us in tedious exposition. As with his own autobiographical slog In America , the director is content to depict surface adversity and resilience without offering much in the way of interior glimpses. It may be true that young orphan 50's work ethic was inspired by his glass-pressing desire for unattainable new kicks ("Window Shopper" is a soundtrack single), but why should we care? Sheridan and Sopranos  screenwriter Terence Winter  never deliver the thing that Hustle & Flow  got rightthe thrill of making music coupled with the jolt of suddenly dreaming bigger than the block.
Judging by Sheridan's interview fawningin one, he calls 50 Cent a "black Jesus with the wounds to prove it"he was probably more seduced by the bang and bling anyway. And it's more entertaining, if less gripping, when the film indulges in episodes of gangland revenge. Among other things, our stoic hero clashes with a Lex Luthor -ized villain named Majestic (supposedly based on real-life drug lord Kenneth "Supreme" McGriff ), and a pair of swaggering Colombian thugs who comport themselves like Alfred Molina  in Boogie Nights  crossed with the dude from Nickelback . Be warned, when a fedora-sporting Godfather starts wheezing out pearls about violence begetting violence, you may die tryin' to stop laughin'.
Evidently Sheridan told 50 that if his acting was weak, the fault would be with the direction. Not sure who gets the credit for the opposite, but 50's acting is fine. As his prison buddy/manager, Terrence Howard , still scanning as Hustle 's hoopty-cruising Djay, predictably steals his scenes. But 50's cool pain holds up to Eminem 's 8 Mile  fluster. Actually, Em's hothead persona gave him more latitude for actorly expression. Conversely, 50's image relies on a matter-of-fact toughness that slays in videos but can't by definition betray much emotional bandwidth. He doesn't get much chance to show it here anyway, aside from one weepy moment when his girlfriend-babymama gives the P.I.M.P. what for. Most moral dilemmas are handled by clunky voice-over like "I don't know what I wanted a gun for, but I got one anyhow."
Like Hustle & Flow  and 8 Mile , this hip-hop ascent ends on the verge of fame. Unlike those two films, though, it doesn't bring enough musical fire to really be about creativity. And though it touches on the idea of fatherhood, it's not about that either. A few narrative head fakes suggest there might be a Darth Vader , come-to-daddy moment. But understandably, the most reliable father figure turns out to be Benjamin Franklin . His green mug anyway. And whatever that was he used to say about wisdom and wealth, which, in the world of Get Rich , are obviously one and the same.
