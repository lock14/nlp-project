Once in a while, I'll sit in the dark of a movie theater rapt with awe. Did that 10-year-old boy just call John Wayne a slur worse than pansy? Did he just shoot his Russian stepfather in the shoulder? Well, yeah, but only after the druggy stepfather walloped the boy's ex-prostitute mom.
The wonders never cease in "Running Scared," a depressing piece of gun-crazy Hollywood scuzz that, with its gassy style and runaway immorality, makes a Tony Scott movie look like a Robert Bresson picture.
The 10-year-old here is a dour hockey enthusiast named Oleg (Cameron Bright), and the snub-nose revolver he just fired belongs to medium-time New Jersey hoods. They include Joey Gazelle (Paul Walker), who spends the movie chasing the boy for the gun, which Oleg got while playing in Joey's basement with his son Nicky (Alex Neuberger).
Normally, if you've seen one grimy, over-cranked movie that appears to have been shot, edited, directed, and acted on a copious supply of Red Bull, you've seen them all. What ensues in "Running Scared" almost needs to be seen to be believed.
Oleg and Nicky get mixed up in a world of grisly doings and nonstop expletives. That could have been dark fun but writer-director Wayne Kramer ("The Cooler") manages to douse their adventure in woeful clichés, the most needless of which is Chazz Palminteri in another oily detective role.
For one 15-minute stretch, though, "Running Scared" breaks character and turns morally inspired when one of Oleg's countless excursions takes him to the home of a cheery couple (Elizabeth Mitchell and Bruce Altman) who perpetrate terrible acts on kids. Desperate, the boy calls Joey's wife (Vera Farmiga), who comes to the rescue with an electrifying, all-too-momentary diversion from the jingoism, misogyny, racism, and homophobia on display.
Farmiga gets our adrenaline going and walks off with the picture, playing the one character with a moral compass and a scintilla of righteous common sense. Plus she seems like the only person in the movie who could be from New Jersey.
Walker's part is a Mark Wahlberg special, but he doesn't have Walhberg's seductive thuggishness. After "Into the Deep" and "Eight Below," the actor seemed to be hitting his stride as a mellowed dreamboat. Here he goes psychopathic and leans hard on the F-word as though that were the only way he could justify his measly Garden State accent.
The two younger actors are sorely inexpressive. I beat up on "City of God" for giving its baby gangstas a glamorous amount of power, and for letting the amateurs who played them eat their roles up. But the two kids in "Running Scared" walk into lurid scene after lurid scene emotionally detached from it all, as if the nastiness will roll off them because they've refused to engage it. They seem catatonic instead.
"Running Scared" might have been able to get away with the relentless sadism the boys witness were the movie as good as the John Woo and Quentin Tarantino films from which Kramer is cribbing. Instead, it's often just witless and foul. It might be actionable, too. If I were Kramer I'd watch my back for a lawsuit from Rockstar Games for what feels like an unauthorized and relocated adaptation of "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City."

         Would it be tempting fate to call "Running Scared" the worst movie of the year already? Especially since the year has produced so many turkeys it's starting to feel like Thanksgiving in February? Maybe it'll persuade fate to have a little mercy, because it's hard to imagine what worse than "Running Scared" would be like. Not to mention worrisome, and profoundly depressing.
 
  Written and directed by Wayne Kramer, who co-wrote and directed "The Cooler," "Running Scared" stars Paul Walker as a low-level mafia guy who finds himself in for a long, ultraviolent night after his son's best friend steals a gun used in a mob police massacre and uses it to shoot his abusive stepfather. If this sounds like a respectably run-of-the-mill plot for a respectable run-of-the-mill "popcorn" thriller (and it's compulsory to defend those, right? On the grounds that people love their junk and shouldn't be made to feel bad about it?), it's because synopsis cannot do justice to this kitsch atrocity.
 


         






    If the title rings a bell, it may be thanks to the viral (never has the word seemed so apt) marketing magic of an online game New Line Cinema created to promote it, screen shots of which were posted all over the Internet. In the game, the player gets to be Walker's virtual head pleasuring his virtual movie wife. It's a tease for a moment that never quite arrives in the movie — just as Joey can only think about sex after a hard day's slaughter at close range, wife Terry (Vera Farmiga), from whom he keeps no secrets, can only think about her spaghetti sauce — but it encapsulates the vulgarity and self-loathing that hangs over this movie like a toxic smog.
 
  Joey hides the gun in his basement, not noticing that his kid and his kid's neighbor friend Oleg (creepy Cameron Bright) are watching. No sooner has the meth-addicted, John Wayne-tattooed Russian stepfather next door slapped Oleg's dinner to the ground and rubbed his mother's face in it, than Oleg puts the gun to use. The conceit is that if the gun that shot Anzor Yugorsky (Karel Roden) is discovered to be the same gun that shot a dirty cop in a dirty place, Joey will be dead. We know this because he spells it out in front of his wife and son as though he were talking about a tough day at the ham-processing plant. If Tony Soprano were watching, he would walk out and politely demand his money back, probably without stooping to violence.
 
  By the time Joey catches up with the errant child, Oleg has barely survived an armed drug dispute in a crack treehouse in the park, narrowly avoided having his face sliced open by a self-described "Mac Daddy pimp," forged a friendship with a kind-hearted, filthy-mouthed hooker, and barely escaped the clutches of a pair of perky mom-and-pop child-snuff porn producers. As the movie becomes more howlingly ludicrous by the second, it's tempting — and not in a cynical way, either — to start reading it as a parody of pornographic video game violence. How else to explain the absurdly desaturated footage (is it a European shaving cream ad?), the horror-movie sets and the let's-shoot-the-police-badge-from-15-angles-Tony-Scott-style aesthetic abuse? In fact, "Running Scared" is so desperate and surreally stupid that all you would have to do to see it as a brilliant sendup of everything that is corrupt, vulgar, sad, deluded and bad-for-you about Hollywood is squint. But that game is old and tedious, and a glance at the list of producers suggests that what we have here is a sincere grab at coolness — that eternal, elusive questing beast of the middle-aged, well-remunerated and grip-deprived. It's not so bad for Walker, who is just modeling through. But it's a shame about Farmiga, as some of the praise recently heaped on her is bound to be shoveled off after this. As for the kids allowed to appear in soul-choking poison like this — don't we have laws?

When you hit Paul Walker in the face with a hockey puck, does he not bleed? This is but one of many thorny questions raised by Running Scared , a giddily awful, awfully giddy action noir that follows a low-level mafioso (Walker) on his hunt for a hot gun lifted from his family basement by a troubled neighbor-child, who in turn uses it against his abusive step-father, who just happens to be the meth-making Russian-mobster-next-door, not to mention a fanatical John Wayne aficionado. Actually, to say this movie ''follows'' anything is severely misleading: Running  is a fevered smashup, as if Hollywood dug up Sam Peckinpah's corpse and forced it to adapt Grand Theft Auto: Vice City  for the screen.
But this isn't a Hollywood movie at all. Writer-director Wayne Kramer (The Cooler ) is the latest ''outsider'' to prove there's no blockbuster cliché independent filmmakers don't covet. Marinara accents? Check. Hooker con corazón de oro? Si. But give it this: Running Scared  is pugnaciously ugly, unvarnished hackwork, and it commits to its nightmarish puerility with a vengeance. The picture pulsates with a genuine, un-focus-grouped bloodlust. A child with a gun is its central image  and it's assumed that this will not horrify, but empower. Pederasts appear suddenly and improbably, caper demonically, and are banished ballistically. It's as if someone smelted his personal ''issues'' into bullets, spun them into a cylinder, and fired them directly into your brain.


A ferociously energetic piece of filmmaking, "Running Scared" makes the seedy Vegas milieu of writer-director Wayne Kramer's first feature, "The Cooler," look as tasteful as "The Sound of Music." Starring Paul Walker in a confident new vein as a lowly mobster desperate to protect his family, this nasty little number offers a harrowing descent into a New Jersey underworld replete with hoods, hookers and hot merchandise. Potent low-budget acquisition should perform solidly for New Line, though the extreme violence and aggressively sordid atmosphere will test audience limits.
Like "The Cooler," Kramer's sophomore effort tells an earnest love story wrapped in sleazy ambience, albeit pitched at a much higher and more frightening level of intensity. Pic is dedicated to Sam Peckinpah, Brian De Palma and Walter Hill, and it boasts enough graphic bloodshed, sinuous camerawork and robust genre smarts to warrant the gesture.
A botched drug deal involving the Italian Perello mob triggers the breathless opening shootout, which ends with the death of a dirty cop. Low-level Perello operator Joey Gazelle (Walker) is ordered to quickly dispose of the snub-nosed revolver used in the killing, a task that's easier said than done.
Upon returning home to his loving wife Teresa (Vera Farmiga), Joey stashes the hot revolver in the basement, an act witnessed by his young son Nicky (Alex Neuberger) and Nicky's neighbor friend Oleg (Cameron Bright).
Oleg's family -- abusive, John Wayne-obsessed stepfather Anzor (Karel Roden) and quietly suffering mother Mila (Ivana Milicevic) -- are introduced in a tense, beautifully paced and shot sequence that whooshes back and forth between the two houses in a series of bravura tracking shots. Set piece culminates with Oleg using the hidden revolver to shoot his stepfather and then escaping into the night.
This throws Joey into a panic, not only because the gun is out in the open, but because Anzor is a member of the Russian Yugorsky mob, which has shady dealings of its own with Perello clan chief Frankie (Arthur Nascarella).
Conflict between Joey's dual identities as expert assassin and devoted family man -- as well as his need to shield Nicky and Oleg from corruption -- at times suggests a latter-day "Road to Perdition," but plays out with less pretension and considerably more pulpy vigor. Still, there's no denying that viewers not prepared for the relentless stream of nasty personalities, profane invective and bone-crunching violence are in for a very long sit.
Walker (currently onscreen in "Eight Below") anchors the proceedings with perhaps his most authoritative and sustained leading-man perf to date, though his macho anguish at times borders on one-note. Continuing her ascent following her breakthrough turn in "Down to the Bone," Farmiga proves more than Walker's match, playing Teresa as a sexy, tender yet highly formidable mother lion.
But it's 13-year-old Bright -- possessed of the same unnerving inquietude he displayed in "Birth" -- who best dramatizes the story's concern for the plight of endangered children. The scenes unfolding from his perspective have a nightmarishly surreal "Wizard of Oz" quality that at times defies explanation. Pic's most gripping sequence seems to come out of nowhere, a shockingly creepy episode that sees Oleg held captive by a devious married couple (Bruce Altman and Elizabeth Mitchell).
Nothing that follows is nearly as intriguing, least of all the graphic final showdown between the Perellos and the Yugorskys. Concluding reel, though it delivers the necessary emotional wrap-up, feels implausible and tacked-on.
Sexual frankness is one of Kramer's calling cards as a director, and while it lacks "The Cooler's" full-frontal daring, pic is far more revealing than most mainstream fare. Somewhat more disturbingly, helmer's fondness for scenes focusing on the abuse and humiliation of women -- albeit in ways that invite sympathy rather than contempt -- is again very much in evidence.
James Whitaker's cinematography, relying heavily on Steadicam and crane shots, dazzles with a desaturated palette that nevertheless has a rich, grimy luster. Arthur Coburn's hyperkinetic editing makes deft use of jump cuts, split-second fast-forwards and rewinds, while Mark Isham's arrestingly off-kilter score plays a crucial role in keeping auds unnerved.
That the film is set in New Jersey but was shot largely in Prague only compounds the oddity of the project.

Paul Walker  plays Joey Gazelle , a mob associate in New Jersey who stashes evidence in his basement. His young son Nicky is good friends with the neighbor boy Oleg, whose stepfather is a nutcase Russian crystal meth addict with a giant John Wayne  tattoo on his back (and he's downright subtle compared to some of the characters we meet later). One day, when the boys are playing, Oleg sees the evidence stashed in Joey's house, takes a distinctive gun home with him, and shoots his stepfather, before running away into the night. Problem is, that particular gun was used in the murder of a crooked police officer, and now mobsters, cops, and other nutjob Russians are all trying to find it. Thus begins a long night for Joey, who has to find and get rid of the gun before anyone can prove it exists. Writer-director Wayne Kramer  (The Cooler ) is about as skilled at storytelling as Walker is at acting, which is to say not very.
