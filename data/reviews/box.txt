Some movies lure you with the promise of dark revelation, only to lead you down a rabbit hole of obscurity. For the writer-director Richard Kelly, that pattern doesn't represent a miscalculation in filmmaking  rather, it's his goal . The Box , Kelly's latest, follows his flaked-out cult nightmare Donnie Darko  (2001) and his half-inspired, half-cocked apocalyptic satire Southland Tales  (2006), and it's an even less satisfying mess than they were.
Kelly certainly sucks you in, though. In this ominous yet vague sci-fi conspiracy thriller set in 1976 in Langley, Va., NASA researcher Arthur Lewis (James Marsden) and his wife, Norma (Cameron Diaz), receive a mysterious ''gift'' on their doorstep: a wooden box with a glassed-in push-button on top. They are then paid a visit by Arlington Steward (Frank Langella), a tall, gray-suited espionage type with a hideous burn scar that has eaten away the lower left side of his face. Steward explains the box's function: If Arthur and Norma press that button, somewhere on Earth a person they have never met will be killed; they will also receive $1 million. Inevitably, they push the button. And just as inevitably, the consequences of this selfish (and, as the film presents it, all but irresistible) act spring forth in ways that they could never have imagined (or wanted).
It's no coincidence that The Box  plays like the world's murkiest Twilight Zone  episode. It's loosely based on ''Button, Button,'' a short story by Richard Matheson, who wrote some of the series' greatest scripts, and it's got a smashing late-'50s/early-'60s-flavored musical score that pulsates with Zone -ish film-noir dread. Yet the movie, as Kelly has adapted it, is also a grandiose paranoid fairy tale full of futuristic motifs that don't lead anywhere except to their own increasingly entangled oddity. Kelly tosses in inexplicable nosebleeds, tony references to Sartre's No Exit , a Cronenbergian theme of bodily disfigurement, an army of Body Snatchers  zombioids, and a watery gateway to the next dimension. None of it quite adds up, and by the time the formidable Steward announces, ''I am in communication with those who control the lightning,'' even Langella's crisply controlled performance begins to seem bonkers. Kelly has talent, but for his next movie, he might try coming down to earth and forgetting about the people who control the lightning.

 Richard Kelly, the writer and director of the much-loved “Donnie Darko” and much-loathed  “Southland Tales,” has a thing for the apocalypse.  Like those films, his latest, “The Box,” is  sincere and sinister and inevitably ambitious, a serious work that insists on its own seriousness even when it edges toward the preposterous. As in his earlier films, he is again using genre (and pretty actors) as a vehicle to ask questions about the human condition (and conditioning) amid a thicket of high, low and trash cultural allusions and against a backdrop of impending doom. But the end isn’t nigh in Mr. Kelly’s world. It’s here.  The similarities among all three of his features (he also wrote the screenplay for “Domino”) are striking and suggest that Mr. Kelly is developing a worldview, puzzling through the great questions, or fast-working himself into a creative impasse, maybe all three. Based on “Button, Button,” a short story by the fantasy writer Richard Matheson, “The Box” is the first of the  movies Mr. Kelly has directed that he didn’t write from the ground up. This doesn’t much matter, because the original story, which was first published in Playboy in 1970 and runs about 10 pages, is merely a humble scaffolding for Mr. Kelly’s mazelike narrative, with its sharp and snaking turns, its periodic dead ends and various pathway choices.  Navigating those paths alongside the audience are Norma Lewis (Cameron Diaz) and her husband, Arthur (James Marsden), an attractive, seemingly happy middle-class couple who in 1976 are living  in a pleasant Virginia suburb with their only son, Walter (Sam Oz Stone). Norma, a teacher at a private high school, and Arthur, an engineer at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration who’s hoping to make astronaut, live somewhat beyond their means, or so she says.  There’s a sports car  in the driveway, and Walter attends the school where Norma teaches Sartre’s “No Exit” to rich whelps more interested in her limp.  Perhaps it’s no surprise, then, that after they receive an offer to earn a million dollars, they grab it.  As in the short story, the payout comes with a shocking condition: they have to murder someone first by pressing a red button on a curious little box, or so says  the man making the offer, Arlington Steward (Frank Langella). Norma doesn’t seem terribly shaken by this stipulation or by the fact that she can see some of Mr. Steward’s teeth through the hole in his cheek. (Don’t worry about it, he says,  and she doesn’t, though I did.) Mr. Kelly doesn’t seem too concerned about the moral angle, either, which he takes his time getting to, creating a needless complication in a movie overstuffed  with complications, including severed toes, watery portals to another dimension, the Mars Viking mission,  murdered wives, tall ships and even, alas, the twin towers.  A lot happens. Some of what happens tracks, some does not. Sometimes this matters, sometimes not. The actors are fine, and to watch Norma trying to persuade Arthur that they  need to push the button is to realize that Ms. Diaz should go dark more often. Mr. Marsden seems a little lost (you can’t blame him), but he handles the story’s hairpins. He’s also better served by the digital cinematography than Ms. Diaz;  shot by Steven Poster, the movie has been washed in 1970s browns that serve the vibe if not her skin tone. But Mr. Kelly leans too heavily on traveling shots here,  and his habit of slowly moving the camera toward something or someone, a creeping meant to intensify suspense, soon feels like mannerism.  Mr. Matheson, perhaps best known for his novel “I Am Legend” (the basis for the Will Smith thriller), has described the idea behind his short story as “a sacrifice of human dignity in exchange for a specific goal.”  That more or less describes the themes, which he bundles together with unadorned prose, a heavy serving of dread and a gratifying, blunt, O. Henry-like kicker. It’s the kind of ending that can make you laugh out loud because the final twist of the knife is at once so expected and yet nonetheless pleasurable. (Part of the delight, of course, is having that expectation met.) Like many fine genre works, the story satisfies your appetite for tales of this type and leaves you a little something extra to savor.  For his part, Mr. Kelly has an uneasy relationship to genre, or maybe he just needs a writing partner, someone to help him edit all his bright and dim ideas. “The Box” is alternately fluid and inspired, and rarely dull (though it is a little, on occasion). But too often it also feels strained, which might be expected from any movie that name-drops “No Exit” in one scene and the grim 1970s sitcom “What’s Happening!!” in the other. There are, as with his previous films, various visual gifts, like the spooky image of an airplane hangar glowing in the night and the odd image of Norma’s little toe waving like a finger. But Mr. Kelly is so busy sampling genres and confusing the issue that he rarely gives you time or space to enjoy them. In the end, he often seems as lost as his characters, trapped in a Pandora’s box of his own making.  “The Box” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Gun violence, moral quandaries, gnarly toes.

Pushing a few of the right buttons and plenty of the wrong ones, "The Box" reps a dicey mainstream effort by enfant terrible
 Richard Kelly following the doomed exploits of 2006's "Southland Tales." Expanding a Richard Matheson story into a '70s-set thriller in which a couple is besieged by space-age conspiracies, nose-bleeding zombies and quotations from Jean-Paul Sartre, the pic reveals the hazards of taking "Twilight Zone" material too far and too seriously. Still, Kelly's trademark mix of sci-fi, surrealism and suburbia occasionally entertains, while Cameron Diaz should carry the cult helmer into more commercial playpens. Warner Bros. release opens Oct. 29 in Australia and bows Nov. 6 Stateside.
Matheson's enormous oeuvre has spawned a truckload of films (including the recent "I Am Legend"), while his short story "Button, Button" was already adapted into an episode of the '80s reboot of "The Twilight Zone" series. Kelly claims to have discovered the tale's wicked premise -- a couple is offered a sum of money if they push a button that will kill a complete stranger -- on TV, but his adaptation goes way beyond both the teleplay and Matheson's text toward weirder, wilder and, apparently, autobiographical areas.
Setting the action -- which takes place entirely in 1976 -- in and around NASA's Langley Research Center and its neighboring Virginian 'burb, Kelly returns to his "Donnie Darko" roots by depicting an all-American family succumbing to paranormal forces, with several nods to the styles and sounds of the epoch.
Had this been the center of the movie, rather than an increasingly murky plot that attempts -- via lightweight existentialism and only so-so special effects -- to explain the meaning behind the titular object, Kelly might have pulled off the experiment. Instead, he widens his scope to cover far too many happenings, conspiracies and cultural artifacts, while his characters fail to be compelling as they get knocked around by the unknown.
Once the box is left on the doorstep of Arthur Lewis (James Marsden) and his wife, Norma (Diaz), the film proceeds to explain their motivations for pushing the button. Arthur, an inventor responsible for optics on the Mars Landing Program, is passed up for a promotion to astronaut. Norma, a lit teacher with a (literal) club foot, learns that her faculty status will no longer grant their son, Walter (Sam Oz Stone), a discount on his private-school tuition.
Although these are clearly not the best reasons to kill another person, Norma winds up doing the deed, and someone across town immediately drops dead. This seems to please the device's ominous creator, Arlington Steward (Frank Langella), who dresses snappily to disguise the gaping hole in the side of his face and soon shows up at the Lewises' with their $1 million prize.
From thereon, the couple's guilt propels Arthur to investigate the box's origins, and things begin spinning in confusing circles that involve NASA, the NSA, tales of kidnapped children, lots of people with nosebleeds and hordes of zombified civil servants. Meanwhile, Steward's antics start to resemble the moralizing "games" of "Saw's" Jigsaw, leading to a nasty closing dilemma.
Despite the overkill, Kelly gains some arresting imagery from his multiple plotlines, with d.p. Steven Poster and production designer Alexander Hammond providing a groovy monotone look, replete with '70s gadgets and backed by Arcade Fire's retro score. A disturbing wedding rehearsal dinner, which appears early on, highlights Kelly's talent for inserting absurd and paranoid elements into seemingly normal events.
Performances are characterized by a certain nostalgic stiffness, resembling those of the TV shows ("What's Happening!!", "Alice") seen in the background, that keeps the viewer at a distance. Langella's Steward particularly feels like the product of another era, and his diabolical wizard is far from terrifying, especially when he starts quoting Sartre.
Indeed, the French philosopher's concept of free choice seems to be one of several themes driving the narrative. But they all feel cobbled together in an effort to show how good Kelly is at thinking out of "The Box," when what's really needed is a glimpse inside at something more credible and engaging.

The secret is out. Warner Bros.  waited to unwrap The Box   until two days before its opening because, compared to its madcap predecessorsthe psychotic Holden Caulfield  update Donnie Darko   and the delirious welcome-to-the-21st-century extravaganza Southland Tales the new Richard Kelly  movie is basically a sock of coal for Christmas.
A mysterious stranger offers a nice American couple an unusual deal: They stand to make a million dollars if theyll just push a button on a gizmo that will, they are told, instantly kill a total stranger somewhere in the world. Hugely expanded from Richard Matheson s cautionary short story (which, in its critique of alienated greed, reads like the précis for an old Twilight Zone  episode and was, in fact, adapted during the shows mid-80s revival), Kellys supernatural thriller is hardly irrelevant in its premise. Familiar enough when Matheson wrote Button, Button in 1971, the notion of remote-control murder is newly topical in the days of roadside bombs and drone warfare. The Box  doesn't lack for ideasthe maraca bean rattle of extraterrestrial lightning-zap CIA zombie nosebleed conspiracy reaches a dull roar by the time it ends. Neither is the directors first commercial project an impersonal piece of work. The problem is that here, unlike in Donnie Darko , Kelly never manages to invest crank theories and baroque genre trappings with anything deeper than longstanding obsession or autobiographical reference.
As made clear in his interviews, Kelly set the movie in 1976the year after he was bornand filled it with details from his childhood and his parents lives. I decided to take this gift of a short story and make it about people I care about and respect. Im not interested in telling a story about a couple of selfish jerks. Indeed, Cameron Diaz anxious and dowdy as a suburban momimpulsively pushes the button, and precipitates the "horror," 20 minutes into a two-hour movie, out of panicky concern for her husband (bland James Marsden ) and their very nervous little boy (nine-year-old Sam Oz Stone ) who is in danger of losing his private-school scholarship.
Hmmm. Maternal sacrifice could be a burden and the nuclear family an oppressive unitor so Ive heard. Whats more, studio filmmaking is kinda confining, n'est-ce pas ? Sartres No Exit , which Kelly once told Variety  was among the three books that influenced him most, figures mightily in The Box . (Kelly also seems familiar with Sophies Choice or, at least, her choice.) Unlike Southland Tales , which interrupted a July Fourth barbecue with mushroom-cloud fireworks, The Box  issues a very somber cosmic warning. Symptoms multiply, free-floating guilt is literalized, and the psychic mutilation is right out frontFrank Langella s Martian Mephistopheles has half a facebut, considering his movies outlandish paranormal subject matter, Kellys booga-booga is actually pretty subdued.
The Box  is less chilling than chilly. Precise and measured in its often-inexplicable special effects, the movie inexorably devolves from po-faced sub-Lynchean menace to soggy Kubrickian metaphysics. And yet, although anything but subtle, The Box  somehow skirts the utterly ridiculous until its wannabe Wagnerian closer. Its a measure of Kellys glum conviction that his movie must mean something that the package holds together for as long as it does. The best thing about this movie is that its title keeps suggesting new self-reflexive metaphorslike the tightly wound filmmakers dogged attempt to think outside it.
