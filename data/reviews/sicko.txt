In his new film, professional gadfly Moore alights on the topic of the shortcomings of the American health-care system and, with this subject, crafts his most widely accessible and least divisive documentary to date. His film contends that the American system of managed health care is conceptually misguided and governed by the for-profit motives of the insurance industry. Sicko
 argues that universal health coverage should be regarded as a basic human right and strikes a resounding blow against Americans� culturally ingrained resistance to the idea of socialized medicine. He does this not in his customary fashion of pounding on the doors of insurance CEOs to deliver withering on-camera ambushes and humiliations, but instead with the stories of dozens of middle-class Americans who have dutifully paid their insurance premiums and felt secure about their coverage only to find themselves abandoned by their insurance companies during their times of need. The story Moore tells is one that cuts through all political and social boundaries, disease being an enemy that strikes indiscriminately. Sure, the filmmaker remains a master of rhetoric and a sometimes sentimental sap, but this time he uses those strategies to great cinematic effect (though admittedly, Moore�s aw-shucks, average-guy posture and grossly overweight bearing is an occasional distraction that makes a viewer want to point out that a diet and simple exercise plan would go a long way toward solving the filmmaker�s personal health crisis). Moore visits health facilities in England, Canada, France, and Cuba � countries where universal health coverage is assured � and shows many examples of how these systems are superior to the managed care in the U.S. and how socialized medicine doesn�t have to mean diminished care for patients or reduced wages for doctors. Granted, his studies of these countries neglect to ask a number of questions and show incomplete pictures, yet it�s impossible to come away from these examples without wondering how it is that America is the only industrialized nation that does not provide universal coverage � especially curious given our easy acceptance of the universal rights to such things as education and Social Security. Extremely successful are also the segments in which Moore reveals a moment in the Nixon White House tapes (�the gift that goes on giving,� Moore says in interviews) in which he identifies the president�s delight over Kaiser�s new health plan that provides less coverage for more profit and the way in which Hillary Clinton evolved from the overhauler of the U.S. health system as a newcomer to Washington to her present position as the second biggest recipient of insurance company money. Never one to settle for the �if you can�t beat them, join them� approach, Moore moves the debate�s front lines to your nearest movie theatre. Though we will differ on the methods of improving the American health-care system, Sicko
�s enduring contribution is the undeniable evidence that the system is broken. If the film brings the debate out into the open of our movie lobbies and living rooms, it can�t be long before the conversation trickles into the corridors of Congress.


Man of the people or America 's very own Great Satan? Wherever you stand, you have to admit Michael Moore has a gift for making a point.
Perhaps that's understating the matter. When the celebrated (and reviled) filmmaker pulls up in a fishing boat outside the US detention camp at Guantanamo Bay and announces via bullhorn, "I have three 9/11 rescue workers! They just want medical attention! The same you're giving Al-Qaeda !," we are witnessing a master gadfly at the top of his game. Whether we can't breathe because we're laughing too hard or because we feel like we've been punched in the gut is moot.
"Sicko" is Moore's best, most focused movie to date -- much more persuasive than the enraged and self-righteous "Fahrenheit 9/11 " -- and not just because the director turns the dial down on his own faux-folksy persona. Moore has a thesis he can get his arms around this time. Resolved: The US health-care system is a disaster, built to punish the sick and enrich corporations. Other countries do it better -- a lot better. Why is that, and how do we change? It's only on the last point that Moore falters.
Go ahead, feel smug; you live in Massachusetts, where affordable universal insurance becomes law on Sunday. "Sicko" unleashes its scorn not just on insurance companies, but on HMOs, Big Pharma, and the politicians they own. The movie builds its case from the ground up, with anecdotes of average Americans so cruelly abused by the system the only response is the laughter of disbelief.
One man lost two fingers to a tablesaw, then was told by doctors he could afford to have only one re attached, so would he prefer the middle or ring finger? A woman was denied the cost of post-car-crash EMS care because it hadn't been pre-approved. Another woman was told she must give back the money that paid for her operation because she hadn't disclosed a pre-existing condition: a yeast infection years earlier.
Those are the more grimly entertaining stories. Others just make you want to cry, and for once you don't feel Moore is exploiting other people's tragedies (any more than they want him to, at least). Some people were willing to use the director right back; there's a tart little segment about a father desperate to get a second cochlear implant for his baby girl (the insurance company would only pay for one), who drops Moore's name in a phone message to the claims department. Bingo -- the implant is approved.
"Sicko" features interviews with former insurance company employees who describe quotas for claims denials and bonuses for anything above quota -- the system appears rigged specifically to not
 provide help to those who need it. Moore talks to a doctor whose signature is on a series of denials to a woman suffering from a brain tumor; it turns out the signatures are stamped without the doctor ever reading the claims.
How did we get here? "Sicko" reaches back to the Nixon administration for a fascinating secret-tapes conversation in which aide John Ehrlichman urges the president to get behind Kaiser Permanente's HMO approach to health care. (The next day, Nixon announced the HMO Act of 1973. ) Moore also brings up Hillary Clinton's doomed attempt to pass a universal health-care bill the way you might discuss an ex who stood you up; he acidly notes Senator Clinton is now the second-largest recipient of contributions from health-care corporations.
The film's bitterly funny activist vaudeville truly begins when Moore travels abroad to see how different nations take care of their sick and injured, beginning with a woman who sneaks over the border to Canada for health care. "We're Americans," he deadpans. "We go into other countries when we need to. It's tricky, but it's allowed."
It's when "Sicko" ventures across the channel to France that Moore and the movie swoon most amusingly. Three months' paid leave for cancer survivors! Doctors who make house calls! Health-care nannies who do the washing for new mothers! "No one from the government comes to do your laundry in America," gripes the director.
Actually, back in America, facilities are seen dumping those who can't pay onto the street in their hospital gowns -- Moore has the surveillance-cam footage. The United States is ranked 37th in the quality of its health-care system, "just above Slovenia ." We have the highest infant mortality rate in the Western Hemisphere.
Does Moore present his case even handedly? Not remotely, which is one reason he's the rock star of nonfiction moviemakers. In the grand tradition of troublemakers from Thomas Paine to Thomas Nast to Jacob Riis , he dares to have a point of view and the effrontery to press it without tact. He'll fudge a fact or two in the interests of what he considers the greater truth, and his critics are happy to call this lying.
This can and has (and continues to) get him into trouble, and the film's walk-in visit to a Cuban hospital seems a medical miracle too rose-colored by half. Perhaps we'll see all the outtakes in the DVD, including whatever it took to set up this sequence.
"Sicko" has so much fun pointing out what's wrong, in fact, that it can barely be bothered to specify what might make things right. There are plenty of universal health-care proposals out there -- put forth by presidential candidates, various states, foundations -- but Moore knows the details would cramp his style. His genius as a provocateur is his failure as a policy analyst, and that's the American way, too: Put on a good show but leave the particulars to someone else.
Still, for once the investigation seems to have fueled Moore's outrage rather than the other way around. Whatever you call his movies -- agitprop, advocacy entertainment, Commie propaganda, the Truth -- "Sicko" is built to persuade. It succeeds by making us ill with laughter and with shame.


         No one ever accused Michael Moore of not having a point of view.
 
  A master propagandist and disturber of the peace with an eye for pretense and hypocrisy, Moore can orchestrate outrage pro and con like no one else. It wasn't an accident that his "Fahrenheit 9/ll" was the highest-grossing documentary of all time; it was business as usual.
 


         






   Moore is back again examining America's healthcare system in the aptly named "Sicko." It's likely his most important, most impressive, most provocative film, and it's different from his others in significant ways.
 
 For one thing, Michael the Confronter, the man who relished face-to-face encounters with the rich and powerful, is no longer in evidence. "I wasn't in the mood to do that, it was not where my head has been at," the director said at his Cannes news conference. "I became tired of yelling and screaming, not getting anywhere."
 
 Rather than irritate people, what Moore wants to do is have an impact on policy and in an area that touches more Americans more directly than any other he's examined. In fact, one of the challenges "Sicko" faces is that concerned citizens may feel they've heard enough on the healthcare debate to last a lifetime.
 
 One of Moore's gifts, however, is the ability to go over familiar territory in his own unmistakable way, to turn dry policy issues into powerful emotional appeals. A tireless researcher (undoubtedly backed by a hard-working staff) and a master deployer of anecdotal evidence, Moore knows if he did it like everyone else, no one would be listening.
 
  A key to Moore's technique is his folksy, faux-naïve persona, complete with puzzled looks a silent-film star would envy and a way of asking disingenuous questions he already knows the answers to in a voice that plays with listeners the way Heifetz played the violin.
 
  Moore also has a gift for intuitively understanding how to orchestrate the situations reality provides. Much has been written, for instance, about his taking a handful of 9/11 rescue workers to Cuba for their medical care, but the actual gambit is considerably more sophisticated. After seeing extensive news footage of government officials boasting about the fabulous healthcare Al Qaeda detainees are receiving, Moore heads not for Cuba per se but for the notorious prison at Guantanamo Bay.
 
 "We don't want any more care than you're giving the evildoers," he intones piously through a megaphone at Guantanamo's watery entrance. "Just the same."
 
 And though pre-release news stories assumed that "Sicko" would be little more than a compendium of healthcare horror stories, Moore in fact has broader points in mind. He believes that profit-driven healthcare is a system that dehumanizes everyone it touches. And it's not working particularly well, either, placing our level of care at No. 37 in the world, "just slightly ahead," Moore says in that disbelieving voice, "of Slovenia."
 
 Before he gets to those broader points, Moore does take a bit of time to set the scene. He gives a nod, complete with anecdotes about the dollars-and-cents price paid for severed fingers, to the 50 million Americans with no health insurance.
 
 Then he moves on, with heavy irony, to "those of you who are living the American dream," namely the 250 million citizens who do have health insurance. As Moore documents with grim examples, these people can have such extreme difficulty actually getting their companies to pay their bills that even the people doing the denying are sometimes moved to tears.
 
  Curious how we Americans, "a good, generous people," got to this point, Moore takes a brief detour into the politics of healthcare, focusing on the great number of members of Congress — including Hillary Clinton, whom he first applauds and then derides — who accept huge campaign contributions from the healthcare industry.
 
 Finally, and this is the true focus of the film, Moore takes in-person trips to Canada, Britain, France and Cuba, showing once again through examples how both patients and care-givers seem to thrive in countries where, as one patient puts it, "you don't have to bring a checkbook when you go to the hospital."
 
 Though he doesn't confront anyone, Moore's amusing presence in these scenes — for instance, searching tirelessly for a cashier in a British hospital only to find that its purpose is to pay patients' travel expenses — give this section its biting humor.
 
 What Moore is doing with many of these anecdotes and interviews is countering what he considers to be the domestic myths that have grown up around government-sponsored healthcare, such as the idea, a favorite of Ronald Reagan's in his pre-presidential days, that it was the first step toward a communist takeover. (Not quoted but called to mind by all this was a college professor of mine who liked to remind students that the earliest universal healthcare in Europe came courtesy of "that notorious creeping socialist, Otto von Bismarck.")
 
 Obviously, Moore is being selective about the situations he shows us, but his point — that there is another side to this contentious issue than the one we usually hear — is difficult to ignore.
 
  We would be horrified, the filmmaker insists, if the police and fire departments were forced to make profits, so why should healthcare have to go down that difficult road? We Americans inevitably feel we know the best way to do everything, but the great accomplishment of "Sicko" is that it is difficult to watch this slyly confrontational film and remain sure.
 
 
 "Sicko" MPAA rating: PG-13 for "brief, strong language." Running time: 1 hour, 56 minutes. In general release.   

Even after the confetti from the Michael Moore publicity circus has been swept up, the fact remains: The American health-care system is a mess, and only Moore, among popular filmmakers, is doing anything to explain the situation, using his patented carnival storytelling tools to blur advocacy and entertainment. From the title on, Sicko  is outspoken in its dismay that a country as rich and powerful as the United States should force so many of its citizens to gamble on the odds of sustained good health.
But dismay in this case is healthy . With considerably less personal bombast than he laid on in Fahrenheit 9/11 , Moore first shows how the profit-driven health-insurance industry got this way. Then he introduces various Americans who have suffered as a result of business as usual. And then he looks at how a few other countries have (in his never-mistaken-for-humble opinion) done health care better: England, France, Canada, and, yes, Cuba. Moore's doofus persona as an American abroad wears thin  a man who wins awards at Cannes can no longer pass as a rube. And the Cuban escapade, designed to provoke, backfires when he loses focus by including Cuban firefighters in an homage to 9/11 first responders. But the questions Moore leaves viewers with are important, nonpartisan ones. If other countries can provide their people with universal health care, why can't we? If we can't, who are  we?

 It has become a journalistic cliché and therefore an inevitable part of the prerelease discussion of “Sicko” to refer to Michael Moore as a controversial, polarizing figure. While that description is not necessarily wrong, it strikes me as self-fulfilling (since the controversy usually originates in media reports on how controversial Mr. Moore is) and trivial. Any filmmaker, politically outspoken or not, whose work is worth discussing will be argued about. But in Mr. Moore’s case the arguments are more often about him than about the subjects of his movies.  Some of this is undoubtedly his fault, or at least a byproduct of his style. His regular-guy, happy-warrior personality plays a large part in the movies and in their publicity campaigns, and he has no use for neutrality, balance or objectivity. More than that, his polemical, left-populist manner seems calculated to drive guardians of conventional wisdom bananas. That is because conventional wisdom seems to hold, against much available evidence, that liberalism is an elite ideology, and that the authentic vox populi always comes from the right. Mr. Moore, therefore, must be an oxymoron or a hypocrite of some kind.  So the table has been set for a big brouhaha over “Sicko,” which contends that the American system of private medical insurance is a disaster, and that a state-run system, such as exists nearly everywhere else in the industrialized world, would be better. This argument is illustrated with anecdotes and statistics — terrible stories about Americans denied medical care or forced into bankruptcy to pay for it; grim actuarial data about life expectancy and infant mortality; damning tallies of dollars donated to political campaigns — but it is grounded in a basic philosophical assumption about the proper relationship between a government and its citizens.  Mr. Moore has hardly been shy about sharing his political beliefs, but he has never before made a film that stated his bedrock ideological principles so clearly and accessibly. His earlier films have been morality tales, populated by victims and villains, with himself as the dogged go-between, nodding in sympathy with the downtrodden and then marching off to beard the bad guys in their dens of power and privilege. This method can pay off in prankish comedy or emotional intensity — like any showman, Mr. Moore wants you to laugh and cry — but it can also feel manipulative and simplistic.  In “Sicko,” however, he refrains from hunting down the C.E.O.’s of insurance companies, or from hinting at dark conspiracies against the sick. Concentrating on Americans who have insurance (after a witty, troubling acknowledgment of the millions who don’t), Mr. Moore talks to people who have been ensnared, sometimes fatally, in a for-profit bureaucracy and also to people who have made their livings within the system. The testimony is poignant and also infuriating, and none of it is likely to be surprising to anyone, Republican or Democrat, who has tried to see an out-of-plan specialist or dispute a payment.  If you listen to what the leaders of both political parties are saying, it seems unlikely that the diagnosis offered by “Sicko” will be contested. I haven’t heard many speeches lately boasting about how well our health care system works. In this sense “Sicko” is the least controversial and most broadly appealing of Mr. Moore’s movies. (It is also, perhaps improbably, the funniest and the most tightly edited.) The argument it inspires will mainly be about the nature of the cure, and it is here that Mr. Moore’s contribution will be most provocative and also, therefore, most useful.  “Sicko” is not a fine-grained analysis of policy alternatives. (You can find some of those in a recently published book called “Sick,” by Jonathan Cohn, and also in the wonkier precincts of the political blogosphere.) This film presents, instead, a simple compare-and-contrast exercise. Here is our way, and here is another way, variously applied in Canada, France, Britain and yes, Cuba. The salient difference is that, in those countries, where much of the second half of “Sicko” takes place, the state provides free medical care.  With evident glee (and a bit of theatrical faux-naïveté) Mr. Moore sets out to challenge some widely held American notions about socialized medicine. He finds that British doctors are happy and well paid, that Canadians don’t have to wait very long in emergency rooms, and that the French are not taxed into penury. “What’s your biggest expense after the house and the car?” he asks an upper-middle-class French couple. “Ze feesh,” replies the wife. “Also vegetables.”  Yes, the utopian picture of France in “Sicko” may be overstated, but show me the filmmaker — especially a two-time Cannes prizewinner — who isn’t a Francophile of one kind or another. Mr. Moore’s funny valentine to a country where the government will send someone to a new mother’s house to do laundry and make carrot soup turns out to be as central to his purpose as his chat with Tony Benn, an old lion of Old Labor in Britain. Mr. Benn reads from a pamphlet announcing the creation of the British National Health Service in 1948, and explains it not as an instance of state paternalism but as a triumph of democracy.  More precisely, of social democracy, a phrase that has long seemed foreign to the American political lexicon. Why this has been so is the subject of much scholarship and speculation, but Mr. Moore is less interested in tracing the history of American exceptionalism than in opposing it. He wants us to be more like everybody else. When he plaintively asks, “Who are we?,” he is not really wondering why our traditions of neighborliness and generosity have not found political expression in an expansive system of social welfare. He is insisting that such a system should exist, and also, rather ingeniously, daring his critics to explain why it shouldn’t.

Three years after winning Cannes' top prize for "Fahrenheit 9/11," docu helmer and agent provocateur Michael Moore returns to the Croisette with more polemics-as-performance-art in "Sicko," an affecting and entertaining dissection of the American health care industry, showing how it benefits the few at the expense of the many. Pic's tone alternates between comedy, poignancy and outrage as it compares the U.S system of care to other countries. Given Moore's celebrity and fan base, plus heightened awareness of the pic resulting from the heated battle that's already begun between left and right, returns look to be extremely healthy.
Pic should also play well internationally, providing an eye-opening lesson for foreigners who may be inclined (like Moore's Canadian cousins) to take out insurance from their homeland before visiting the States.
Chief criticism of the film is that it paints too rosy a picture of the national health care of the countries he compares America to, including Canada, England, France -- and Cuba.
Employing his trademark personal narration and David vs. Goliath approach, Moore enlivens what is, in essence, a depressing subject by wrapping it in irony and injecting levity wherever possible: a graph shows America's position in global health care as No. 38 -- just above Slovenia -- and is followed by film footage of primitive operating conditions; and he offers a long list of health conditions that can deny a person insurance coverage, with the list scrolling into deep space accompanied by the "Stars Wars" theme.
Pic explores why American health care came to be exploited for profit in the private sector rather than being a government-paid, free-to-consumers service as are education, libraries, fire and police. Moore comes up with an archival audio recording of Richard Nixon from February 1971, praising Edgar Kaiser and his system using incentives for less medical care. The next day Nixon addresses the nation, proposing a new health care strategy that amounted to a less-per-patient expenditure to maximize profit.
Pic starts by sketching a gamut of health-care horror stories from average Americans: those who can't afford insurance, those who are denied coverage for various, often ludicrous reasons, and those who believe themselves well-protected, but find that the moment they avail themselves of medical services their insurance provider uses obscure technical reasons to refuse coverage, retroactively deny claims and cancel insurance, or raise rates so astronomically that the patient is forced into the ranks of the nearly 50 million uninsured.
Perhaps the most emotionally affecting story comes from Julie, a hospital worker whose husband had a potentially terminal illness that the medical staff thought could be treated with a bone marrow transplant. Insurance deemed the treatment experimental and refused to cover it. Unable to afford an alternative, the husband died. 
The congressional testimony of a former Humana medical director provides a devastatingly direct description of what she calls "the dirty work of managed care." Constantly told that she was not denying care to patients, rather simply denying them Humana's coverage, her career advanced as she saved her corporation money.
Moore appears in his shambling folksy persona about 40 minutes into the pic, interviewing foreign citizens, American expatriates, hospital workers and doctors in countries with nationalized health care. The dramatic contrast with America is played for laughs, as the seemingly incredulous Moore continually mutters, "What do you mean it's free?" 
Pic's most dramatic (and now controversial) tactic involves Moore taking a group to Cuba that includes 9/11 rescue volunteers with medical problems that haven't been covered by insurance. First they go to Guantanamo Bay, which Moore proclaims as the only place on American soil with universal health care, and then to a Havana hospital where they are given treatment. Cuban seg wraps with a poignant expression of emotional solidarity between 9/11 volunteers and Cuban firemen who pay them homage.
Pic incorporates extensive archival footage (some of which comes across as grainy on the bigscreen) as well as home movies and photographs. Extracts from Communist musicals, classic comedies and horror films provide Moore further opportunity for comic editorializing. 


Were Americans. We go into other countries when we need to. Its tricky, but it works. So declares Michael Moore  in the midst of his new documentary, Sicko . Moore may be riffing on the war in Iraq , to name only our most recent intervention, but hes actually referring to U.S. citizens crossing the border into Canada for cheap meds and free health care.
There hasnt been a comparable joker in the left-wing deck since Abbie Hoffman  went underground. But while Hoffman played the media, Moore uses it to play fast and loose. Still, Sicko , which had its world premiere last month at Cannes  (where mainstream Moore is romanticized as the subversive maker of celluloid samizdats), shows Americas preeminent cinemuckraker in a seriously polemical mode. The Weinstein Brothers, who produced and are co-distributing Sicko , might have ripped off the title of one of their greatest hits and called it Scary Movie .
Sicko s opening gross-out features a guy suturing his own woundbut, as Moore points out, this movie isnt about him or the 50 million other Americans without health insurance. Its about the 250 million Americans who do have coveragelike the 79-year-old guy working in a supermarket to maintain his prescription-drug benefits. The movies first half-hour is a virtual sideshow: Step right up and see the medically bankrupt couple forced to live in their daughters basement trophy room, the woman whose insurance carrier told her that she failed to get an emergency ambulance pre-approved, the employee who lost her benefits because she didnt report an ancient yeast infection as a preexisting condition.
Annotating these and other, more ghastly human-interest stories, Moorewho for much of Sicko  is narrator rather than participantadopts a tone dripping with treacle and sarcasm. Hes the P.T. Barnum  of human misery who, going back to Roger & Me , has never been one to let details interfere with a good story. And yet, as Moore builds his case that health insurance in America is essentially a profit-making enterprise based on bilking the afflicted, the cumulative effect of this material is devastating.
Expert witnesses are called. Dr. Linda Peeno  tearfully testifies that in fulfilling her mandate as an HMO medical director, shes withheld services that have cost lives. Politicians are producednot just Bush, always available for some idiotic comment, but even Hillary Clinton , whom Moore dresses down with the fury of a jilted lover, pointing out that, after the debacle of her 1994 bid for universal health coverage, she is now the No. 2 recipient of HMO donations.
After demonstrating the state of health care in America, Moore visits those industrial societies that enjoy universal coverageCanada, Great Britain (where even an American nincompoop who threw out his back trying to cross Abbey Road on his hands gets free hospitalization), and, above all, France. This love letterfawning enough to add the suffix phant to the movies titleinspired a smattering of embarrassed applause at Cannes. But really, it should embarrass us. When Moore jokes that the wonders of the French health-care system were enough to make me put away my Freedom Fries, hes obviously thinking about the health of the body politic rather than his own.
As filmmaking, Sicko  sometimes resembles an infomercial for Ozark real estate and elsewhere demonstrates a Kenneth Anger-like flare for vertical montageas when Moore mischievously uses a jolly harvest hymn from the Stalinist musical Cossacks of the Kuban  to sovietize our own marching firemen, heroic teachers, and indomitable mail carriers. In any case, its as a rhetorician that Moore is most original and effectively demagogic. (In his most shameless stunt, the filmmaker anonymously bails out an anti-Moore website, paying the proprietors medical bills.) Are Bush and Giuliani  the only ones allowed to dial 9/11? Cleverer than either, Moore plays that card himself. In an already notorious PR provocation, he rounds up a crew of volunteer emergency workers with untreated respiratory problems and, in answer to some C-SPAN  bragging about the excellent health care available to Gitmo  prisoners, organizes a flotilla to the one place on American soil with free universal health care. The expedition never gets closer than the edge of the base, but they do get to experience the wonders of Cuban medicine$120 inhalers for five cents, free dental implants, a peoples hospital of cathedral-like splendorcomplete with fraternal lecture from Che Guevara s daughter.
Sicko  has the clearest agenda of any Moore film, albeit one that dares not speak its name. Is there a more vivid image of human garbage than the spectacle of a Los Angeles hospital dumping indigent patients on skid row? What manner of system is this? If the American health-insurance industry is Moores unspoken metaphor for Capital (feeding vampire-like on human labor), Cuba is his unconvincing socialist paradise. Dr. Moore reveals all manner of symptomsbut is it impossible for him to diagnose the disaster we live without offering another sort of drug?
