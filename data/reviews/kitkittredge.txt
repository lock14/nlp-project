 Arriving in theaters buffered by a built-in audience of upscale female tweens, “Kit Kittredge: An American Girl” appears poised to incite the kind of box-office frenzy more commonly associated with characters named Hannah and Harry.  Over the last 20-odd years American Girl — the savvy purveyor of magazines, books, dolls and television movies — has gradually won the approval of parents seeking an alternative to the vanity of Barbie and the sexiness of the Bratz. Its commitment to down-home values, meticulously researched back stories and be-all-you-can-be girl power has a seductive wholesomeness: alongside the flagship line of historical dolls (excuse me, “characters”), your daughter can play in a past where low-rise jeans are as unthinkable as high-rise apartments.  Written by Ann Peacock and based on Valerie Tripp’s stories for the doll of the same name, “Kit Kittredge” takes place during the Great Depression in Cincinnati (earnestly played by Toronto), where the jobless are in the streets and the middle classes are in denial. To 9-year-old Kit (little miss Abigail Breslin), however, the shambling hobos who haunt her affluent neighborhood have an untapped utility: as subjects for the article she’s determined to have published in The Cincinnati Register.  Kit’s Amanpour aspirations are briefly sidelined when her beloved father (Chris O’Donnell) loses his car dealership and heads to Chicago to look for work. Desperate, her saintly mother (a lovely Julia Ormond) opens their home to a motley collection of boarders, who provide the film with a lively core of adult performances and punch lines. Stanley Tucci is especially delightful as a smooth-tongued, secretive magician, while Joan Cusack, always more comfortable in vinegar than sugar, struggles a bit as a librarian whose personality leans more toward batty than tart.  Finding friendship  — and more than a little farce —  in deprivation, “Kit Kittredge” is a movie of missing men and lonely women. In Kit’s world the absent father (a familiar theme from girls’ novels including “Little Women” and “A Little Princess”) is an epidemic, and the picture makes this the impetus for children’s resourcefulness and emotional development.  Endlessly curious and cheerfully pushy, Kit pursues amateur sleuthing and hobo rescue with equal vigor, locking Ms. Breslin into a relentlessly spunky performance that restricts her considerable range. Less wearing are her closest sidekicks: a very sweet Madison Davenport as Kit’s best friend, Ruthie, and Zach Mills as Stirling, a delicate, jug-eared darling who’s sure to be breaking hearts before he breaks his teens.  A study in tolerance wrapped in a Nancy Drew mystery, “Kit Kittredge,” with its all-American ideals and old-fashioned rhythms, seems an odd choice for the Canadian director Patricia Rozema. Best known for her sharply modern and feminist take on Jane Austen’s “Mansfield Park,” this director does what she can to showcase female resilience in the context of a story unavoidably more invested in Kit’s color-coordinated, ’30s outfits than in the harsh realities of extreme poverty.  Nonetheless this classy, heart-on-its-sleeve movie is packed with laudable life lessons and Depression-era trivia, including the fact that the hobo sign of fish bones means really good garbage (particularly useful on the Upper East Side). But when you consider that a Kit doll, complete with book and accessories, will currently run you $105, the movie’s insistence on the nobility of the indigent might be a tad more difficult to stomach. 

Plucky, likable and determined to succeed, much like its heroine, �Kit Kittredge: An American Girl� is a throwback to the kinds of movies they don�t make anymore. Anchored by a fine performance from Abigail Breslin, this wholesome, engaging entertainment offers something for viewers ages 7 to 107 and, given the popularity of the �American Girl� brand, should be an especially hot-ticket item for elementary- and middle-school girls. A platform release should benefit from positive word of mouth among �Kit�s� target demo and, just as importantly, the target demo�s moms, yielding strong returns.
That there�s been a dearth of intelligent, appealing live-action movies directed at girls should surprise no one. Into the breach steps �Kit Kittredge,� the first �American Girl� theatrical feature (and the fourth filmed adaptation, following WB telepics �Felicity: An American Girl Adventure,� �Samantha: An American Girl Holiday,� and �Molly: An American Girl on the Home Front�). 
By way of background, Wisconsin-based �American Girl� (founded in 1986) is a line of dolls, books and accessories notable for their historical accuracy. Each character hails from a different period and thus grapples with a period-appropriate challenge in her respective book series, gleaning valuable life lessons as she struggles to prevail.
The story unfolds in Cincinnati circa 1934, with 10-year-old Kit (Breslin) about to see the effects of the Great Depression firsthand. Kit�s brisk voiceover establishes that her dad Jack (Chris O�Donnell) has a car dealership, her mom Margaret (Julia Ormond) has a garden club, and her older brother is away. 
Keenly observant (and a remarkably good typist), Kit aspires to be a reporter and visits the Cincinnati Register, hoping to pitch a story on the Chicago World�s Fair to hard-nosed, fast-talking editor Mr. Gibson (Wallace Shawn). �Get lost, kid� is the gist of his response.
The sudden appearance of a foreclosure sign next door, an encounter with a pair of hobos and spirited classroom debates begin to change Kit�s sense of her world, often glimpsed safely from the treehouse in her front yard. But nothing prepares her for the moment she discovers her own father has joined the ranks of the newly unemployed. Played without dialogue, it�s a beautifully restrained scene of mutual realization and tacit shame.
When Jack heads for Chicago to find work, Margaret takes on boarders to make ends meet. A socially diverse community of shared financial distress, the Kittredge boarding house includes coquettish dance instructor Miss Dooley (Jane Krakowski); daffy mobile librarian Miss Bond (Joan Cusack); clever illusionist Mr. Berk (Stanley Tucci); and the reserved Mrs. Howard (Glenne Headly) and her 9-year-old son, Stirling (Zach Mills). 
The friendly young hobos, Will (Max Thieriot) and Countee (Willow Smith), do repairs on the Kittredge property in exchange for food. For her next pitch to the Register, Kit decides to track Will and Countee for a day and learns about riding the rails, the pictograph-specific hobo language and life inside a �hobo jungle,� or tent village.
All of this is both engaging and well elucidated. Beyond that, though, the story feels remarkably current; the era and specifics may be different, but the climate of economic anxiety is something to which contempo American audiences can easily relate.
Mr. Gibson has no interest in a piece about kindly hobos, especially because they are presumed responsible for a rash of robberies in the Midwest. When these suspicions rear their head at home, Kit sets out to unravel a mystery -- and she does, although the very last scene is a hair too treacly and forced.
Helmer Patricia Rozema (�Mansfield Park�) does an excellent job navigating the film�s tonal shifts, incorporating comedy, tragedy and a suspenseful denouement with equal grace. Tech contributions are strong, especially David Boyd�s sepia-inflected lensing and Philip Cosco�s down-to-the-last-1930s-detail production design Equally creditable is Joseph Vitarelli�s score, which is seamlessly interwoven with well-chosen standards from the era, including �Don�t Fence Me In� and �It�s Only a Paper Moon.�
Breslin provides not only marquee value but also welcome spunk and tenacity (if only her stiff blonde wig were as lively as she is -- it�s the one prop that seems wholly fake). In a performance without vanity (and with virtually no makeup), Ormond has never been better. Supporting cast is also fine, though Cusack�s ditsy librarian will resonate better with kids than with adults. And Shawn�s casting as the salty editor will come as a delicious inside joke to those who fondly remember his father William�s tenure at the New Yorker. 


To my 10-year-old daughter, the term "American Girl" means "that store my meanie of a mom—unlike all the other, higher-quality moms—won't let me go near." While we're on the defensive, why should I? She hates dolls, and I—creeped out by row upon row of homogenized mannequins with staring Stepford Wife eyes and designer threads—get nauseous within 50 feet of that posh emporium, which peddles multiculti feminism with an outrageous price tag.
Such are the cultural contradictions of corporate capitalism: As Disney  is to tales of plucky small-town proles hurdling adversity through hard work and decency, so the American Girl franchise, a subsidiary of that mom-and-pop outfit Mattel , is to our nation of happy rainbow families, celebrating our shared values while honoring our differences. Could be worse, I guess, but with their sturdy ethnic heroines—African-American, Native American, and every other American you can think of—overcoming poverty and discrimination, the American Girl books are as predictable as they are proto-feminist and inclusive.
A trial balloon sent up to test the ether for extending the franchise, Kit Kittredge : An American Girl  is no exception. Based on several American Girl stories about a 1930s cub reporter in Cincinnati , this dull theatrical debut especially disappoints because I'm usually fond of square, sepia-toned, period-costumed kids' movies (like Fly Away Home ) that go nowhere at the box office. This one could go somewhere: As the opening weekend of Sex and the City   showed, gee whiz, there's a distaff market out there, so why not tap the little ones?
With Julia Roberts  as executive producer, and Mattel exec Ellen L. Brothers  co-producing, Kit Kittredge  has some heavy female muscle behind it, and they hired what ought to have been a class-act creative team. Written by Ann Peacock  (The Chronicles of Narnia ) and directed by Canadian indie filmmaker Patricia Rozema , the movie stars Little Miss Sunshine 's Abigail Breslin  as Kit, a feisty, can-do Midwesterner from a comfortable family who's covered every surface of her bedroom with pictures of role models Eleanor Roosevelt  and Amelia Earhart . Kit is a girl reporter in search of a subject; one quickly presents itself in the form of the Great Depression, which here falls on rich and poor alike, as Kit discovers when—a touch improbably—she bumps into her car-dealer father (Chris O'Donnell ) lining up at the soup kitchen. With noblesse oblige no longer an option and Dad off to Chicago to seek work, Ma Kittredge  (the oddly cast Julia Ormond , not everybody's idea of a folksy frau) starts renting rooms to the poor, the needy, and the charismatically colorful of all classes and races.
Pretty as a picture in butterscotch lighting and period dress, Kit Kittredge  spins its wheels for close to an hour, waiting for something villainous to show up. When it does, in the form of profiteers led by Stanley Tucci  and Joan Cusack , the movie's pulse quickens ever so slightly as Kit and her rag-tag new friends get on the case—but not enough, unfortunately, to get a serious plot afloat. Instead, widespread worthiness ensues: Kit gets a byline; Mom invites the unwashed to stay for Thanksgiving; and poof goes penury, taking racism and class inequality with it.
That resolution brought tears to the eyes of my two tween companions, who liked the movie much more than their crabby chaperone. She continues to cling stubbornly to the dowdy notion that kids deserve better than a sugarcoated portrait of our past or, for that matter, our present. Talk all you like about sisterhood and national solidarity, but I'd love to know what it's like to watch Kit Kittredge  when your house has just been foreclosed, or your credit jacked up without warning—or, like the movie's distributors, New Line and Picturehouse, you've just been handed the pink slip from the parent company.
