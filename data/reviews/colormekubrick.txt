Malkovich, Malkovich, Malkovich. This movie is all about Malkovich lounging in fishnets and pumps, dissolute and reptilian, Malkovich cadging triple brandies from starstruck party boys. �I seem to have left my laser platinum, no-limit American Express VIP card at home,� he shrugs. Entranced, people give him bottles of vodka, hotel hospitality, and Mont Blanc pens; with a flourish, he cosigns a business deal for a wine bar. And why not? They all think his character is film director Stanley Kubrick � who at this point in the �true�ish� story of con man and Kubrick impostor Alan Conway was not yet dead, though he was likely mortified. (Conway and Kubrick died within months of each other in 1998, the film informs.) Besides being bald on top and essentially biped, Conway doesn�t resemble Kubrick, and he knows nothing of his work � a bar hustler tricks him by complimenting Judgment at Nuremberg
, which was directed by Stanley Kramer
 � but, for the most part, he passes, scamming everyone from New York Times
 theatre critic Frank Rich (William Hootkins, understatedly good) to a lounge-singing prot�g� (Davidson, overstatedly good). At least at first. Director Cook and screenwriter Anthony Frewin know their Kubrick � Frewin is his former assistant; Cook an assistant director on The Shining
, Barry Lyndon
, and Eyes Wide Shut
 � so they drop all kinds of references, the best of which is Conway�s dramatic entrance into a laundrette accompanied by Also sprach Zarathustra
. (The front-load washer spins and spins, mesmerizingly.) It�s also a playground for Malkovich � enjoyable enough but not terribly deep, with little illumination of Conway�s behavior. An apparent lifelong liar and alcoholic, Conway seems to draw on his mark's vanity, but the movie rarely pauses for reflection; it just wants to have fun. The structure feels choppy, as well � freewheeling moments of direct address vie with the somewhat sustained subplot of a fashion designer (Mark Umbers) on Conway�s trail � but mostly it�s a pub crawl from con to con. But at 83 minutes, this is a kicky little movie, if ultimately a little too �ish.� AFS@Dobie



The genteelly shabby older man sidles up to a young fellow at a London pub and casually lets slip that he's working on a movie. After a bit of conversation, his name emerges: Stanley. Stanley Kubrick . Yes, it's true Kirk Douglas was a boor on the set of "Spartacus" and, goodness, I seem to have mislaid my laser platinum American Express
 card -- would you mind paying for the drinks?
The fact that Alan Conway (John Malkovich ) looked nothing like the great British director and didn't even have a solid grip on the man's filmography mattered not a whit. For a few years during the 1990s, the flamboyantly gay con man said he was famous, behaved as though he was famous, and was treated to the groveling reserved for the famous, despite every evidence that he was a drunken bum.
"Color Me Kubrick " digs all sorts of devilish ironies out of this "true...ish story," and it's a fine dark farce before turning sad and, worse, monotonous. The con wears off before the movie does, but while it's in the air, "Kubrick" spins with bogus cheer.
Right from the opening scene, you get a sense of the cheek of director Brian Cook and screenwriter Anthony Frewin (both former Kubrick assistants, by the way). A pair of young thugs out of "A Clockwork Orange " force their way into a posh London townhouse, demanding to see "Mr. Kubrick," but it turns out they're victims rather than victimizers -- just two more sods to whom the ersatz director promised the moon.
There are arch Stanley references all over "Color Me Kubrick": an adult bookshop called "The Blue Danube ," well-known music cues from any number of Kubrick classics, "Barry Lyndon " co star Marisa Berenson in a small role, a stray character named Lolita. The world itself conforms to the reclusive filmmaker's aesthetic, so why shouldn't Conway follow along? Is it so terribly wrong to enjoy the spotlight the director shuns?
The fake Kubrick feeds off the real director's mysterioso reputation, and each of his dupes believes he's been granted a special audience of one. The victims are generally young, exclusively male, all harboring a dream of fame, and "Color Me Kubrick" makes it clear how cruelly they were used. Or allowed themselves to be used: The movie's never-ending joke is that hope and self-interest blind them to the obvious. Conway never has to convince. All he has to do is mention, and his marks take it from there.
In a performance of high-wire camp, Malkovich dares you to believe anyone would mistake Conway for anything but a fraud. Swilling vodka until you can practically smell it seeping from his pores, using a different accent for each victim (I especially liked the one that sounds like Tony Curtis after shock treatment), this Kubrick wants nothing more than the next drink and the next boy toy, either of which might obliterate the pain of being Alan Conway.
Or is the self-loathing an act, too? Malkovich plays it both ways and after a while there's not much to the part except increasingly cloying playfulness. Conway's dupes include the married New York Times
 writers Frank Rich (William Hootkins ) and Alex Witchel (Berenson ), who in this telling become fascinated with the imposture and work to expose it. The movie never convinces us there's anyone there to expose, though, and Malkovich flits from scene to scene without ever anchoring Conway in a lasting reality.
Which is perhaps the point. In truth, Alan Conway had a wife and a son he abandoned. In truth, he and Stanley Kubrick died with in months of each other. No matter. "Color Me Kubrick" reminds us not that we can't handle the truth, but that we don't really want to.


         Stanley Kubrick's appeal and influence were never more fathomable than at the time of his death. The reclusive director made only 13 films, four during the 30-year span between his 1968 opus, "2001: A Space Odyssey," and his 1999 swan song, "Eyes Wide Shut." Almost all are revered with scant reservation by an obsessive legion of fans, some of whom seemed unwilling to take the director's demise seriously, believing him to be in hiding and perhaps working on a new movie. At the time, it appeared as if the auteurist canon had its first Elvis.
 
 Not surprisingly, "Color Me Kubrick," Brian Cook's slight but entertaining film about the man who famously pretended to be Kubrick while the director was filming "Eyes Wide Shut," could just as easily have been about the life of an Elvis impersonator. Cook understands that only a pop culture king could have inspired the twisted form of flattery his considerably affected version of Alan Conway indirectly shows for the iconic Kubrick by donning the director's persona, but he's uncommitted to illuminating this strange man's state of mind. Without insight into the personal traumas that turned Conway on to such mischief, he remains anonymous — not unlike one of the dancing Elvises from Sheryl Crow's "Leaving  Las Vegas
" music video.
 


         






   "Color Me Kubrick" unfolds as a series of comic vignettes that detail Conway's use of Kubrick's identity to his monetary and sexual advantage, beginning with two punks angrily charging up to the home they think belongs to Kubrick and continuing with Conway conning others while trying to avoid exposure. The man's success rate is shocking not only because he bears little resemblance to Kubrick but also because his research into the director's life is sketchy: He is an expert showman, but only up to a point, retreating into an almost childlike state of development whenever he is caught in a lie, as in the scene where an attractive man calls him out for not knowing that "Judgment at Nuremberg" was actually directed by Stanley Kramer.
 
 Though Cook provides no sense of Conway's history, or much context for the man's taste for privilege, John Malkovich brings a freakish sympathy to his character, suggesting both a pathetic junkie hooked on deceit and an aging queen who clings to fantasy in order to broker the affection that is otherwise beyond reach because of his age, average looks and status. This is sad, but when Conway clings to the man who rejects his affections after learning that he is not Kubrick, Cook begins to posit something deeper: this idea that Conway's victims are every bit as parasitic as their tormenter, maliciously using Conway in the same way.
 
 Cook does not feign the formalist rigor of Kubrick's movies, but he does crib a few songs (like "The Thieving Magpie") from the director's canon to illicit a buzz from "Color Me Kubrick's" likeliest target audience: the Kubrick fanboy. Alas, it would appear that this is the very audience that will be most resistant to the film, given the way Conway is played by Malkovich as a nelly queen who uses his false identity to seduce men; for example, the scene in which Conway promises work to an attractive costume designer as a pretense to get his hand in the younger man's pants.
 
 Scarcely an insightful biographical portrait, "Color Me Kubrick" is still interesting, perhaps even intimidating, as a study of the way fandom can so readily be turned against itself.

In the early '90s, a neurotic gay alcoholic English travel agent named Alan Conway swanned his way through London by passing himself off as Stanley Kubrick. He cadged free drinks and hotel rooms, and some free sex, too, but mostly he just sat around parties and bars holding court as the world's most legendary reclusive movie director. Color Me Kubrick  takes this flyspeck of a huckster and builds a teensy yet irresistibly droll film around him. John Malkovich, in a luscious goof of a performance, has a high old time playing Conway as a foppish inebriated loser, an inept con man whose ''impersonation'' consists of carrying on like some broken-down old Hollywood queen. He can barely plan his charade past the next cocktail, yet he is always very grand , and that, it turns out, is enough to sway people.
Everyone is so flattered to be in ''Kubrick's'' presence that the weirder he acts, the more his behavior is taken as the eccentricity of genius. Color Me Kubrick , written by Kubrick's former  personal assistant Anthony Frewin and directed by his former assistant director Brian Cook, doesn't have much shape; it's like a series of sketches mashed into a flaked-out comedy of fame, with Kubrick's soundtracks used as troweled-on irony. Yet as Conway works his idiot magic on punk rockers, third-rate vaudevillians, even The New York Times ' Frank Rich (who helped to unmask the con by writing a story about his experience), the film reveals, rather delectably, how potent the power of suggestion can be in a world gone madly groupie.

 Even if it doesn’t add up to more than a fitfully amusing collection of comic sketches, “Color Me Kubrick” — a fictional portrait of Alan Conway, a real-life British con man who hustled his way across England by impersonating the reclusive, seldom-photographed filmmaker Stanley Kubrick — is a platform for John Malkovich to burst into lurid purple flame.  As you watch his Conway preen and prate, adopting outlandish accents that range from the drawl of a supercilious dilettante to the bray of a Bronx promoter, it is obvious that the actor is having a wonderful time camping it up. But if Mr. Conway, who died in 1998  (three months before Kubrick himself),  was really as ridiculous as the character Mr. Malkovich creates, could he have gotten away with his scams? I wonder.  One who crossed his path was Frank Rich of The New York Times, who encountered Conway-as-Kubrick   in a London restaurant.  When he looked further into the man’s identity, he discovered the ruse  and in 1993 wrote a column about it.  Mr. Malkovich’s flamboyant hustler is only the latest in his gallery of eccentric, owl-eyed flimflam men. Since “Dangerous Liaisons” nearly 20 years ago, he has more or less owned the type: a seducer-thief who speaks in weirdly slowed-down speech patterns and casts a hypnotic power. His Conway is nowhere near as convincing a sociopath as the murderous Tom Ripley, a role that seemed made for him in “Ripley’s Game,” but he is still fun to observe.  With a soundtrack built around excerpts from Kubrick film scores and an opening scene that parodies “A Clockwork Orange,” this arch, episodic movie is really an affectionate sequence of in-jokes conceived as a posthumous homage to Kubrick  by two knowing insiders.  Brian Cook, the director, was an assistant director on the Kubrick films “The Shining,” “Barry Lyndon” and “Eyes Wide Shut.” Anthony Frewin, who wrote the screenplay, was Kubrick’s personal assistant.  The in-jokes even extend to one about Mr. Malkovich himself that alludes to the 1999 movie “Being John Malkovich.”  Mr. Conway, who was gay and seriously alcoholic, used his celebrity alter ego to prey on young men, often encountered in bars, to whom he coyly disclosed his false identity before seducing them with promises of work as actors or designers on forthcoming projects. Sometimes he invented the films’ titles on the spot. He also cadged drinks, claiming he had left his credit card at home. His marks were only too happy to pay. To impress them, he liked to meet them outside the front door of a fancy address that wasn’t his.  In the film these slightly unnerving scenes suggest how shameless flattery, name-dropping and  chutzpah can carry a determined seducer wielding a bogus celebrity mystique. A recurring joke is that Conway wasn’t all that careful in his research. His knowledge of Kubrick’s films had major gaps, and more than once he slips up, is caught and is forced to flee.  The scam to which the movie devotes the most time involves Conway/Kubrick’s promise to help establish Lee Pratt (Jim Davidson), a gold-tuxedo-wearing television entertainer with dyed blond hair, as a star in Las Vegas. While they lay plans to conquer America, Lee, a low-rent Liberace with an Elvis gleam in his eye, installs Conway in a luxury hotel suite on the south coast of England. Relishing his dual roles of celebrity and star maker, Conway lives high on the hog, consuming gallons of vodka and cartons of cigarettes until Lee’s manager becomes suspicious, and the game is up.  Although the movie provides scattered glimpses into Conway when he is not on the make, they are too few to give a coherent sense of who he might be beneath his poses. Perhaps, like many performers, he fully exists only when playing a role. Once the movie gets started, it doesn’t know where to go or how to end. It more or less repeats itself.  The sharpest satire is reserved for the fools who swallow an act that seems transparently fake. Anyone who has watched a TV star besieged by gawking and drooling fans knows what encounters with fame can do in a culture of blind celebrity worship.

An update was made to this review on Nov. 22, 2005.
It's hard to imagine any serious film buff taking a pass on "Colour Me Kubrick," a sly, enormously entertaining romp based on the antics of real-life Brit conman Alan Conway who rooked his way around '90s London posing as Stanley Kubrick. But pic is laid out so it's also completely accessible to viewers who know next-to-nothing about the real Kubrick save his profession. Anchored by John Malkovich's delectable lead perf, awash in accents, mannerisms and constant narcissistic invention, saga looks to earn honest money wherever good scripts full of human foibles are appreciated. French release is Dec. 9.

Venture's insider flourishes -- notably, an opening scene that turns Droog-dom on its ear, plus score's intelligent borrowings from "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "A Clockwork Orange" -- will be a constant source of smiles for cinephiles. Pic's title is embellished with the phrase "A True...ish Story."
Scripter and director are ideally situated to shape the material. Writer Anthony Frewin first worked with Kubrick on "2001" and handled research on all of the meticulous helmer's subsequent films. When Conway's victims began phoning Kubrick's country manse in Hertfordshire demanding to speak to the real Kubrick, Frewin compiled a massive file on Conway's fraudulent exploits.
Director Brian Cook, here making his feature debut, worked closely with Kubrick for three decades, notably as assistant director on "Barry Lyndon," "The Shining" and "Eyes Wide Shut."
Malkovich's slightly fey, chameleon-like powers are perfectly utilized in the role of Conway, whose bottomless chutzpah coupled with the genuine Kubrick's absence from media glare were his greatest assets. Although Conway's wardrobe here (cooked up by costume designer Victoria Russell) ranges from total schlep to flaming queen -- with nothing sober or conventional in between -- Conway's marks, be they musicians, cab drivers or trendy businessmen, are more than willing to overlook a few sartorial eccentricities.
Conway is free to deceive with impunity: When his higher-profile victims realize they've been conned, sheer embarrassment prevents them from pressing charges. Then there are the basically powerless musicians and actors who, believing his tales of stolen credit cards, forgotten wallets, etc., fronted "Kubrick" a few hundred quid while jockeying to curry favor with the great man.
Conway's m.o. includes handing out a posh address and conveniently sitting on the stoop of said residence when his admirers-cum-marks come to call. As a result, marginal and low-life types are forever bellowing, "I demand to see Mr. Kubrick! I know he lives here!" only to be hauled off by the police.
Each of Conway's scams is a small jewel from the Human Credulity Handbook, including dropping names ("Little Tommy Cruise would like a part and I said to him 'perhaps' this morning over breakfast at the Savoy") and playing into other people's fantasies whether they're still struggling ("I need a heavy metal band for my next film") or already successful ("You should be in Vegas").
Conway's homosexuality and fondness for gay haunts translates into many of his marks being gay. But pic confirms that gullibility and wishful thinking are present in every walk of life. Still, two haughty men authoritatively discussing how Kubrick left a "calling card" in "2001," by making HAL an obviously homosexual computer, is a silly delight.
Narrative is primarily a series of con jobs slung together, with the occasional journalist, policeman or male prostitute assessing Conway's shameless maneuvers. But fast-paced pic never wears out its welcome.
Conway's Kubrick-posturing to New York Times theater critic Frank Rich (William Hootkins) and wife Alix (Marisa Berenson) in a London restaurant -- "I don't like what your newspaper wrote about me! I am NOT a recluse" -- planted the seeds of his eventual unmasking. But for Conway, even having his cover blown isn't the fatal blow it would be to less resilient mortals.
Malkovich pulls out all the stops as Conway, affecting wobbly American accents -- from Southern twang to Noo Yawk -- when impersonating Kubrick to different people. In his bigscreen debut, comedian and TV host Jim Davidson is aces as a charismatic Tom Jones-style belter who falls especially hard for Conway's act.
Supporting cast members are a joy, with fleeting but particularly fun use made of Honor Blackman, Peter Sallis (the voice of Wallace in the "Wallace and Gromit" toons) and Ken Russell.
Pic's subtext about the power of celebrity nicely exploits the fact that Conway was able to pass himself off as Kubrick without taking the trouble even to memorize his own alleged filmography or to see the films.

Being John Malkovich  reaches new heights of mincing, self-indulgent madness in Color Me Kubrick . That's no mean feat, but it comes with something of a mean streak here: Malkovich plays Alan Conway , a self-loathing alcoholic weirdo who hustles his way through London's gay bars, rock clubs, and B-list celebrity scenes pretending to be the famously reclusive filmmaker. Based on a true story, this sneering would-be comedy was written by Anthony Frewin , Kubrick's former personal assistant, and directed by Brian Cook , one of his assistant directors and co-producers. They may have known the man, but they've got a flimsy grasp on his doppelgänger. Conway's fraudulent picaresque would seem the ideal vehicle for satirizing celebrity obsession, punking the Kubrick mystique, and rooting into the theatrics of identity, but the CMK  crew settles for a shapeless, low-grade comedy of flamboyance, giggling at Conway's histrionics and fishnet gloving. Malkovich musters a brand-new accent (always ridiculous) and body language (always virtuoso) for each new mark, an impressive if unexaminedact of invention. I find it hard to believe that Conway bamboozled half of London simply by announcing his name, and it's regrettable that the filmmakers premise their picture on such improbable gullibility. The real Conway was assuredly slier than his bio-pic incarnation; he ought to have been played by Sacha Baron Cohen .
