OK, let's see if we've got the movie comedy timeline straight: Not quite a decade ago, the Farrelly brothers really break out. Over the last couple of years, audiences finally find a new anything-goes brand in Judd Apatow, director of "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and "Knocked Up." (Heck, even the Farrellys had grown restless with the same old, same old, and moved on to "Fever Pitch.") So now the next logical development is to knock off Apatow . . . pod-shuffling his humor with the Farrellys' ?
Riding the recent wave in somewhat unlikely style, sketch comedian/director Bob Odenkirk ("Mr. Show," "Let's Go to Prison") and writer Will Forte ("Saturday Night Live") essentially imagine it's the "Dumb and Dumber" guys having the sex and baby issues. Will Arnett ("Arrested Development") and Forte are John and Dean Solomon, siblings and urban roomies whose home-schooled upbringing in the Arctic wastes somehow failed to educate them in the ways of women ("puppet-based sex education" lessons notwithstanding). The boys were raised to have an indefatigable can-do attitude, so they mostly just shrug off their forced celibacy with "we'll get 'em next time" optimism. They're Steve Carell minus the inhibitions and after-hours melancholy. But when they learn that dad Lee Majors is comatose and close to death, they promptly fixate on having a baby as the one bit of miracle news that might keep the old man hanging on.
The movie gets some good moments out of the various false starts that eventually lead the two to Janine (Kristen Wiig), a levelheaded but desperately broke woman kinda-sorta willing to rent them a womb, despite the comically foul-mouthed protests of her estranged boyfriend (Chi McBride). And the brothers, of course, are just as blithely clueless about babies as they are about relationships, setting up a few new variations on those requisite junior high health class exercises in caring for a doll without mangling it. There's one joke in particular about putting a positive spin on scary-dirty diapers that gets stretched like an undersize onesie - yet Arnett and Forte get away with it, hilariously.
"Brothers Solomon" easily tops what Odenkirk, Arnett, and McBride delivered with the stale "Prison," but this new goof might have been funnier still if the premise weren't so derivative, so just been there, done that. It's also odd, if fitting, that a story all about ineptitude with girls actually handles them pretty tentatively itself. From the straightforward material Wiig's given here, you'd hardly know she was an "SNL" castmate of Forte's. And Malin Akerman ("The Comeback") plays it mostly cool but then inexplicably warmer at points as the smokin' chick next door who wants none of John. Ah, women - can't get with 'em, can't make a movie on the subject without 'em.


The Jerk  had a high sperm count: It's spawned scores of Edenically simpleminded man-children, from Harry and Lloyd to the Brothers Solomon. These latest offspring, a pair of socially quarantined, home-schooled frères  (SNL 's Will Forte, who wrote the script, and Arnett, doing a sweeter Gob Bluth), are not without their charms: The sheer, animal idiocy beaming from their faces in the opening credits of The Brothers Solomon  creates the film's only moment of uncalculated comic joy. Alas, their quest  giving their dying father the grandchild he always wanted  feels like a cheapo, soft-R retread of the dimwits' progress from Dumb and Dumber , with director Bob Odenkirk dropping Forte's jokes like anvils.


 The spirit of Steve Martin’s early hit-or-miss slapstick oddities lives on in “The Brothers Solomon,” a crass goof in which two socially inept siblings, John and Dean Solomon (Will Arnett and Will Forte), who were home-schooled in the Arctic by their now comatose dad (Lee Majors), try to fulfill his wish for a grandchild.  Sexually inexperienced and repellently awkward, the two  have  no choice but to opt for artificial insemination. The surrogate mother, Janine (Kristen Wiig of “Saturday Night Live”), views the task as a job at first; but soon enough,  biological feelings  take over. When the delivery date looms and   she disappears,     the brothers embark on a panicked chase across Southern California.  The film’s screenwriter, Mr.  Forte, and its director, Bob Odenkirk (formerly of HBO’s sketch comedy series “Mr. Show”), have fashioned a deranged, sometimes desperate parody of an inspirational losers-make-good comedy. Three gags miss for every one that hits.  But the good ones are keepers: Janine patiently telling the brothers what artificial insemination means, stressing “artificial”; Janine’s menacing but devoted boyfriend (Chi McBride) weeping with rage upon meeting John and Dean; John’s lame dream of a hot-tub encounter with a blond fantasy object named Tara (Malin Akerman), a neighbor and sometime caretaker to their dad, which climaxes with Tara bolting and John ecstatically kissing her wet footprint to the tune of “Almost Paradise.”  “The Brothers Solomon” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and sexual content.

After watching Katherine Heigl have all the fun in "Knocked Up," Kristen Wiig gives pregnancy a shot in "The Brothers Solomon," a forced split-the-baby comedy that proves unwise from its very conception. When titular sibs Will Arnett and Will Forte decide the only way to wake their father from an arbitrary coma is to give him the grandchild he always wanted, they recruit Wiig in a lame-brained artificial-insemination scheme. If "Hot Rod" and "The Ex" couldn't attract an aud, this full-blown comedy miscarriage stands no chance.
Arnett and Forte play thirtysomething bachelors John and Dean Solomon, two bone-headed brothers who are constantly deferring to one another's "better judgment." Raised in the arctic by a single father (Lee Majors), the two socially awkward sibs are ill-equipped for modern dating, their acts of intended chivalry grossly misinterpreted by the women they pursue. On a typical first date, John proposes, and Dean kisses his girlfriend's father on the lips.
When presented with a challenge, the Solomon boys are capable of talking one another into the worst possible ideas. It's an intermittently amusing dynamic that eliminates any potential for conflict, as the duo agree on even the most ludicrous solutions -- namely, a plot to deliver a baby to make their father proud. The challenge, of course, comes in convincing perfect strangers to go along with their schemes.
A check for $12,000 is all it takes to persuade the opportunistic Janine (Wiig) to serve as their surrogate, although the would-be mother, located via Craigslist, complicates things by bringing her antagonistic ex-boyfriend (Chi McBride) into the mix. While the two brothers debate who will do the honors of impregnating her, John sets his sights on Tara, the hottie across the hallway (rising starlet Malin Akerman, who possesses model-beautiful looks but not much range), who exists solely to set up yet another joke that doesn't work.
In director Bob Odenkirk's eyes, there would seem to be little distinction between a serious drama putting a character in a coma and giving Majors the same treatment for comedic purposes, although most auds would vehemently disagree. Nothing so much as resembling genuine emotion occurs in "The Brothers Solomon" (Arnett and Forte specialize in fake tears and plastic grins), placing this comedy in a far different class from this summer's earlier childbirth comedy, "Knocked Up."
The screenwriting credit goes to "Saturday Night Live's" Forte, who repeats that show's frequent sin of crafting sketches that overstay their welcome. Auds must sit patiently by while run-on routines baby-step toward their obvious punchlines, then fall flat, as in a scene in which the brothers hire an aerial billboard to deliver a preposterously long message, only to run out of room at the very end.
Rare is the joke that catches us off-guard, although there is one fresh gag in which the brothers practice changing diapers stuffed with the unlikeliest ingredients. Though neither actor is quite ready to play lead, Arnett has mastered the "most insensitive man in the world" routine, while Forte excels at a unique cross between stunted man-child and Igor-like half-wit. Here, they are Wacky and Wackier, in desperate need of a straight man to accentuate their brand of comedy.
Despite its flaws, pic cuts together as if it were the film Odenkirk set out to make. Cheeky music alternates between composer John Swihart's near-constant chorus of la-la-las and multiple variations on the "St. Elmo's Fire" theme, "Man in Motion."
