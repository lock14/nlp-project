Somerset Maugham, The Third Man
, Manchester United, Kate Beckinsale: Curse me for an Anglophile, but I can�t get enough of our neighbors across the pond. If you want to keep me quiet and content for a few hours, just put on a film with some rhyming cockney slang or high-court intrigue or a stammering Hugh Grant, and you�ve got me. Flushed Away
, the new feature from Aardman Animations (the animation studio that also produced Chicken Run
 and the ingenious Wallace & Gromit
 films) revels in its British-ness � it�s full of bone-dry wit, football references, and ribs on the French � and I was hooked from the first shot of Tower Bridge. The film�s hero, a domesticated rat named Roddy (Jackman), is the perfect comic embodiment of upper-class English propriety: John Cleese with floppy ears and buckteeth. Hailing from the tony London neighborhood of Kensington, Roddy is effete, pampered, and exceedingly well-dressed. But when a rough-and-tumble cockney sewer rat named Sid (Richie) comes crashing into Roddy�s posh, comfortable little world, our hero is sent kicking and screaming down the toilet bowl and into the harsh sewer world below, where rats, frogs, and slugs have re-created a tiny London beneath the real city�s surface and where an ill-prepared and ill-equipped Roddy must quickly learn to fend for himself. Failing miserably, Roddy seeks out the aid of spunky boat captain Rita (Winslet), who takes mercy on the poor house rat and agrees to help him get home. Pursuing them, however, is the sinister Toad (McKellen), who has plans to eradicate the underground city during halftime of the World Cup with the help of his henchmen, Spike and Whitey (Serkis and a spot-on Nighy), who sound as if they just stepped off the set of a Guy Ritchie picture. With his unnerving, wobbly eyes and stentorian oratory, Toad commands every scene he�s in like an overstuffed, overblown, and totally unhinged community-theatre Shakespeare villain (or a mad, bloated patrician from some rodent Gilbert and Sullivan operetta), keeping a smoking jacket and a collection of royal-family memorabilia around to temper his more sociopathic tendencies. Every time he appears onscreen the movie lights up, and McKellen voices him for all he�s worth, intoning to the gods like he can summon thunder and lightning with a word. Flushed Away
 has a wicked, smart, and subtle sense of humor, and unlike so many kids movies these days, its characters � like the brilliant ennui-riddled French amphibious assassin Le Frog (Reno), who looks cosmically, infinitely, and existentially bothered whenever his killing duties pull him away from a cup of espresso � are living, breathing parts of a small ecosystem, rather than just caricatures created to spout out one-liners and sell Happy Meals.


Kids will probably be in stinky-sewage heaven with the new computer-animated critter comedy "Flushed Away," but even they may realize they're up the proverbial creek in a boat with a faulty motor. Parents will while away the time in moderate boredom until the film unexpectedly springs to life in its midsection, then just as abruptly goes back to sleep.
The story line is "Stuart Little" meets "Toy Story" on the way to "Madagascar" -- what, you were expecting originality? Hugh Jackman, busy fellow, voices the role of Roddy the pet rat, pampered and lonely in his gilded London cage. After his human owners go on vacation, the hero has to contend with Sid (Shane Richie), a party-hearty sewer rat who crashes the house and in short order flushes Roddy down the loo.
Down below, Roddy finds an entire bustling rat city, one threatened by the corpulent, villainous Toad (Ian McKellen) who plans to flood the burg by opening the sluiceways during halftime on World Cup Final day (when the entire population of England goes to the bathroom at once, get it?).
McKellen has a grand old time with his part, as do the rest of the cast: Bill Nighy as an albino rat henchman, Andy "Gollum" Serkis as his slightly smarter partner, Jean Reno as a French frog, and -- most cheeringly -- Kate Winslet as a plucky rat adventuress named Rita.
Jackman, by contrast, is stuck in a bland part, and the movie never really takes off until the other characters build up a head of steam. At that point, "Flushed Away" becomes genuinely funny for kids and adults alike, and it sustains an air of congenial lunacy for a good half-hour until the plot rears its ugly head again.
If it all feels a tad bipolar, there's good reason. The film is the third, final, and most fraught collaboration between Aardman Studios, the British-based animation house responsible for the "Wallace and Gromit" shorts, and DreamWorks
, the Hollywood studio behind "Shrek," "Shark Tale," and "Madagascar." Aardman does goofy Claymation wit, DreamWorks does shiny blockbuster computer-generated imagery, and when the two collaborated on "Chicken Run" and "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit," the big behemoth generally let the little guys alone.
Not so with "Flushed Away." Combining clay animation and watery sets proved an insoluble problem (or rather, too soluble), and a 2005 fire at Aardman forced the production to go fully computer-animated, with half the work being done by DreamWorks in the States. Attendant creative clashes were reported, and the two companies have since parted ways.
You can feel the tug-of-war in the back of the multiplex. The characters still have the lidless pop-eyes and funny teeth of Aardman's clay creations -- and no one knows how to make fun of the French better than the British -- but the slick CG is at odds with the company's patented handmade funkiness. For one thing, the mouth
 movements feel jerky and incomplete. For another, "Flushed Away" keeps getting pulled in the direction of formulaic big-budget crash-and-bang only to stop, time and again, for a spot of tea.
Will your children care? No, but listen to them when they're talking about the movie on the way home. The parts they respond to -- the droll character humor or the frenetic action -- will decree which corporate parent will be taking custody of their pop-culture sensibilities. Divorce is a drag, but it's hardest of all on the kids.


         Something of an animated Reese's peanut butter cup, "Flushed Away" brings together two brands that go surprisingly well together. Combining the computer-created visuals of DreamWorks Animation and the cheeky storytelling of Aardman Features, the film mixes rousing kid-friendly adventure with surprisingly savvy grown-up wit and charm.
 
  Roddy St. James (voiced by Hugh Jackman) lives as a pet mouse in a fancy section of London (the British call it posh). After an interloping sewer rat (Shane Richie) flushes him down the toilet, Roddy discovers a thriving mini-metropolis in the sewers, teeming with life. In an effort to get back "up top," he falls in with a rat named Rita (Kate Winslet) and crosses paths with the villainous Toad (Ian McKellen) and his hapless henchmen (Andy Serkis and Bill Nighy).
 


         






    The story is awfully (and amusingly) British, even including a World Cup soccer final as part of the story — with England winning, no less. The voice actors all sound as if they're having fun, and they tackle their parts with uncanny aplomb.
 
  The filmmaking team does a marvelous job of continually varying the pitch of the movie so that new things constantly happen and there's a real air of surprise as the story unfolds. A chorus of singing slugs, which appears at first to be a singular throwaway gag, pops up throughout the film.
 
  Some of the best gags really do come from nowhere, such as when a transition is made by mimicking the style of the '60s "Batman" television series.
 
  The combination of DreamWorks ("Shrek") and Aardman ("Chicken Run") brings fruitful results. The storyboard smoothness of most computer animation has been toned down in an attempt to mimic the handmade feel of Aardman's previous stop-motion productions.
 
  It was the Plasticine reality — that sense of real objects captured in real space — that played a large part in making Aardman films such as "Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" stand apart from the endless stream of cute-talking computer-generated animals that have become the mainstay of family fodder.
 
  As well, the zesty fun of the Aardman films may have previously caused more than a few adults without the requisite youngster handy to find a suitable neighbor or friend's child to cover for their attendance. The add-on price of a child's ticket was likely still less than the popcorn and soda, and a small price to pay.
 
  Adults should feel no such compunction to use subterfuge to slip into "Flushed Away." Rather, they should proudly walk in unaccompanied by a minor.
 
  Who else, after all, are the "Benny Hill" references and jokes about the French temperament possibly intended for?

Flushed Away  is being advertised as the new movie ''from the creators of Shrek  and Madagascar ,'' and while that's savvier than saying it's ''from the bedlam-happy folks who brought you Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit ,'' it isn't honest. The latest collaboration between DreamWorks and Britain's sublimely bent Aardman studio, Flushed Away  is a true hybrid. It's the tale of an upper-crust pet mouse named Roddy St. James (voiced by  Hugh Jackman as an ingratiatingly polite nerd) who gets flushed down a toilet and into the scavenger-happy sewer world under the streets of London. The movie has the fish-out-of-water arc you'd expect in a mainstream kiddie bash, as well as a sculpty CGI sheen that engagingly mimics, without quite reproducing, the thumbprint tactility of Aardman's clay-figure style. Yet it also has a great deal of the Aardman spirit. In the sewer, Roddy discovers a squalid, overstuffed metropolis of rodents, amphibians, and shabby discarded bric-a-brac (kitchen tools become power boats, cheap souvenirs priceless treasures), and characters who have imposing egos, whether it's the Toad, a genocidal frog king (an operatically funny Ian McKellen), still pining for when he was Prince Charles' pet, or a crew of maggots who burst into ''Don't Worry, Be Happy'' at just the right moment. Flushed Away  lacks the action-contraption dottiness of a Wallace and Gromit adventure, but it hits its own sweet spot of demented delight.

 Don’t get me wrong: I’m looking forward to the next James Bond movie as much as anyone else. But it strikes me as unlikely that any British action picture released this year will surpass “Flushed Away.”  Yes, the 007 franchise has the gadgetry, the babes and the dry martinis, but does it have google-eyed, rubber-mouthed leeches (unless they were slugs, or maybe some kind of aquatic worm) singing “Don’t Worry, Be Happy” in splendid choral harmony? (I know, I never wanted to hear it again either, but trust me, you haven’t really experienced the song until you’ve heard it performed by leeches.) Does Mr. Bond have Kate Winslet as his love interest? (Playing a sewer rat, yes. But still. Kate Winslet.) Is his nemesis a giant toad with a fondness for royal family paraphernalia and an obsessive hatred of rodents?  I could go on, but I’ve made my point. “Flushed Away,” directed by David Bowers and Sam Fell, is the first computer-animated feature to come from the very English whimsy factory that is Aardman Animations, progenitors of Wallace and Gromit, Rex the Runt and “Chicken Run.” (DreamWorks, a co-producer of “Chicken Run,” was also involved with “Flushed Away.”)  The technological shift from the traditional Aardman stop-motion animation, using plasticine models, has given the filmmakers new freedom and flexibility — for instance, in confecting sequences that take place in and under water — but the eccentric, handmade “Wallace and Gromit” aesthetic remains happily intact. And at a time when all-ages three-dimensional animation seems to be in a serious rut (how many more movie-star-voiced pleas for interspecies understanding must we be subjected to?), it is a relief to encounter such exuberant and infectious silliness.  At first, “Flushed Away” does not seem so different from its lesser competitors, even as it dares to aim a few mocking jabs at Pixar, the top dog in the computer-animation world. At one point the sentimentality of “Finding Nemo” is grazed by a satirical harpoon, and the story begins in an expansive London house whose clean spaces and tidy right angles recall “Toy Story.” So, at first, does the situation in which the hero, a pet mouse named Roddy (Hugh Jackman), finds himself when his young owner and her family have gone on vacation. He cavorts with the Barbies and the Kens, but this is a lonely, empty pastime — they’re just toys, after all — and it seems to promise a boring movie.    As it happens, a less boring movie would be hard to imagine. Roddy’s life, as they say, is changed forever when an uncouth rat named Sid (Shane Richie) pops up through the plumbing. Roddy, trying to rid himself of the interloper, finds himself sent down the pipes, where he is accidentally introduced into a world of subterranean urban vermin delights.  In spite of the title and the necessity of using a toilet as a portal to the London sewer, the humor in “Flushed Away” is mostly clean. The narrative, on the other hand, is gratifyingly messy, as Roddy, washed up in a miniature London built out of trash and flotsam beneath the actual city, becomes embroiled in some fairly complicated intrigue. He falls in with Rita (Ms. Winslet), who pilots an old boat, and who is harassed by the grandiose toad (Ian McKellen) and his minions, a veritable charcuterie platter of voice-over excess featuring Bill Nighy, Andy Serkis, and Jean Reno as the toad’s French cousin, who is (naturellement!) a frog.  As is the custom with Aardman productions, there is a sweet and modest decency — a wry celebration of Traditional British Values, if you will — peeking out amid the clamor and craziness. (The pop-cultural references and canny music selections, meanwhile, mark “Flushed Away” as an all-American DreamWorks animation product.)  The filmmakers also take evident pleasure in topping themselves, and in conceiving a structure that is less like a roller coaster ride than a ski jump. The picture relentlessly picks up speed, zooming from drollery to anarchy to complete — albeit brilliantly controlled — comic chaos, and before you know it, you’re airborne (even if, strictly speaking, you’re still in the sewer), carried aloft on the wings of leeches.  “Flushed Away” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has a few mildly naughty jokes.

British drollery is fueled by American aggressiveness to mixed results in "Flushed Away." This first adventure in computer animation by Blighty's celebrated Aardman studio succeeds in retaining the trademark look of the company's clay figure stop-motion "Wallace & Gromit" classics and "Chicken Run." But the tone has become more than a bit coarse, as if the filmmakers had heeded a call to compete with some of the more raucous animated hits of recent vintage. Result is a kidpic long on invention but short on likability, indicating midrange commercial results with the target market.
While the setting of so many of the top-grossing animated features, not to mention a certain TV cartoon starring a sponge, has been the deep blue sea, "Flushed Away" is set in a bustling border town right on the H2O divide: the sewers of London, where all manner of creatures end up.
The principals are mice and rats, from very different ends of the class spectrum. From up top comes Roddy St. James (voiced by Hugh Jackman), a Kensington pet mouse whose posh life is rudely intruded upon by uncouth sewer rat Sid (Shane Richie), who takes over the impeccably appointed flat and flushes Roddy down the loo.
Thus does Roddy end up down under, so to speak, in a raucous community that cleverly mirrors the one above it. This intricately detailed reimagining of London made entirely from salvaged garbage remnants -- Big Ben contains elements from a house clock, a washing machine and cups, among other items -- may be the film's most considerable achievement; it's a modern London with a 19th century rude vitality, an environment with which the long-pampered Roddy is ill suited to cope.
The prospects for Roddy making his way back home appear remote for a number of reasons. Beyond logistics, the feisty community is about to be put under siege by the Toad (Ian McKellen), a former privileged pet himself whose malevolence and girth qualify him as an amphibian Jabba the Hutt; his strategy for flooding little London is genuinely inspired.
But before he can implement his plan, Toad, along with his ratty minions (Bill Nighy, Andy Serkis), busies himself trying to do away with Roddy and his new pal of convenience, Rita (Kate Winslet), a working-class rat whose trawler may offer a means of escape. In a film of less than embraceable characters, redheaded Rita stands out as a singular creation, a tough, rough-around-the-edges scrapper who wouldn't normally give a wuss like Roddy the time of day but soon takes up the challenge of his rescue.
As directed by David Bowers and Sam Fell, first-time feature helmers with long-term Aardman affiliations, the film boasts undeniably smart and eye-catching qualities that are significantly diluted by the relentlessly frantic and overbearing behavior of most characters; someone is always loudly imposing himself upon another, to diminishing returns of enjoyment.
When Roddy and Rita finally get a couple of quiet moments to themselves, the lack of general noise comes as a welcome but nonetheless startling relief. And it could be that Roddy comes off as rather less charming than might have been intended. Despite Jackman's smooth, ingratiating delivery, Roddy is simply too useless -- especially in the shadow of Winslet's vigorously voiced, can-do Rita -- to be very interesting.
Other characterizations, notably McKellen's expansively theatrical Toad, a creature of elegant offensiveness, and Jean Reno's as Toad's verrry French cousin Le Frog, who insists upon a five-hour dinner break before pursuing pressing matters, are flavorsome.
Despite having been created on a computer rather than physically molded, the critters still possess the lumpen, forehead and brow-dominant characteristics commonly associated with Aardman. The underground settings and free-associating decor elements create a dark, jumbled look quite at odds with the crisp, clean colorations of most mainstream computer animation. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is an energetic asset.

The third collaboration between Britain's Aardman studio and DreamWorks  animation, this puckish charmer about a posh Kensington  mouse flushed down the loo into London sewer country is to action-adventure what Wallace and Gromit : The Curse of the Were-Rabbit  was to Hammer Horror. Aardman's first foray into CGI may spell woe to loyal fans of the plasticine monobrow, but this watery Technicolor universe, fully furnished with shopping malls and populated with a cast of thousands, could never have been brought off with stop-motion. Pampered house mouse Roddy St. James  (voiced by Hugh Jackman ) also sings, as who wouldn't after being rescued by can-do sewer rat Rita (Kate Winslet ), wearing red spaghetti hair and an iron will? Abetted by other critters with names like Millicent Bystander , the two rodents face off against the dastardly Toad (Ian McKellen ) and his less than competent goons (Andy Serkis  and the adorably adenoidal Bill Nighy ). Beyond the obligatory Hollywood  moralizing about community and cooperation, and the usual Aardman pokes at the mutual disdain of Brits and Frogs, there's a heartfelt upstairs-downstairs tale of urban loneliness redeemed by love and family. And what's not to love about a movie in which thousands of rodents stand together against a Big Wave generated by TV-watching soccer fans flushing their toilets at halftime?
