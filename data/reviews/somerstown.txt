 Ever since he hustled (or was smuggled) onto the festival circuit in the mid-1990s with a couple of entertaining, ramshackle short films  —  modest lovelies like “Where’s the Money, Ronnie?”  — Shane Meadows has been busily carving out his own corner in British cinema. Though the broken-in faces and broken-down places change ever so slightly, the stories and the storytelling have remained consistent enough to make Mr. Meadows something of a brand director, one with a familiar visual sensibility and view of the world that says, yes, there will be blood, but  most people are fundamentally decent and good.  There’s rather less blood than usual in “Somers Town,” an agreeable if slight, vaguely sketched character study times two , which clocks in at 70 fast minutes, including credits. Decency and goodness are much in abundance if not initially visible in the form of Tomo (Thomas Turgoose), a pugnacious teenage runaway from the Midlands who, shortly after landing in London, befriends Marek (Piotr Jagiello), a lonely Polish teenager whose ubiquitous still camera is meant to suggest, I suspect, that he has a sensitive soul. Along with his father, Mariuz (Ireneusz Czop), a construction worker whose cheery disposition hides darker truths, Marek lives in the centrally located London area that gives the movie its title. The two boys meet, clown around, flirt with a French waitress (Elisa Lasowski). That’s about it.  Mr. Meadows explains on his Web site (shanemeadows.co.uk),  that the movie originated with a pitch to the filmmaker from Eurostar, the rail company that operates, among other lines, the  train service between Paris and London, in the tunnel colloquially known as the Chunnel. Eurostar wanted to know, he continues,  “if I would make a feature-length project around the Somers Town area of Kings Cross, using kids from there, Paris and possibly Belgium.”  Maybe the company was trolling for younger customers; it runs trains out of  the neighborhood.  Mr. Meadows doesn’t say. He does clarify, however, that after turning down the project, he changed his mind, suggesting his frequent collaborator, Paul Fraser, who wrote some of his best-known films, like “A Room for Romeo Brass,” for screenwriting duties.  The new movie, digitally shot in black and white, was paid for by Eurostar and, as it happens, includes a brief interlude in Paris (Belgium was left off the itinerary), where Tomo and Marek are reunited with the flirtatious French waitress in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower. Mr. Meadows says on his Web site that he retained creative control of the movie, which is good to hear. He doesn’t mention whether  he and his cast and crew made the voyage from London to Paris on the Eurostar. I hope they traveled first class. Whatever the case, if you’re not freaked out by traveling underwater, it is a nice, fairly short trip,  though, at some three hours, it will eat up twice as much of your life as this movie.  In keeping with the  travel motif, Film Forum will show the movie with “A-Z,” Sally Arthur’s five-minute animated ode to the essential  London street guide.

Two young teenagers kick around the area surrounding North London�s mainline railway stations in the small but perfectly formed �Somers Town,� the latest feature by Brit helmer Shane Meadows (�This Is England�). Basically a comedy but with typically Meadowsian dark edges, it forms an affectionate tribute to cross-cultural friendship and the rapidly changing landscape known as Somers Town, a rundown warren of social housing and decaying industrial wasteland that�s beautifully exalted by pencil-gray monochrome lensing. Brisk (but just right) running time, among other factors, could limit offshore prospects outside fests, but Meadows� name will guarantee auds domestically, especially on ancillary.
Having always set his movies in the Midlands area in and around Nottingham, where he grew up, Meadows breaks new ground here with pic�s London location. Otherwise, with its focus on working-class youth, salty-tongued humor, excellent semi-improvised perfs and thematic exploration of father figures and sons, �Somers Town� is completely of a piece with the director�s previous work. 
Story opens with 16-year-old orphan Tommo (Thomas Turgoose, making good on the promise showed in his debut in �This Is England�) taking the train south from Nottingham on a summer�s day. As he explains to kindly Scotswoman Jane (Kate Dickie, �Red Road�), he might as well go to London since there�s no one for him up north. Underneath his cheeky manner and cocksure, streetwise confidence, it�s clear growing up in care homes has left its scars.
After getting mugged and beaten by some local kids post-arrival in London�s Kings Cross station, Tommo meets up with Marek (Piotr Jagiello, another find), a shy Polish boy who spends his days wandering around the area taking pictures while his dad, Marius (Ireneusz Czop), works on the construction of St. Pancras station. 
The two pal up together, and Marek lets Tommo hide in his bedroom overnight. Script then unfolds as a series of low-key, banter-filled skits as the boys get some work hiring out deck chairs in the park for local character Graham (Perry Benson), jointly pay chaste court to a pretty French waitress and get drunk together for the first time. 
Climax has tension and drama, but nothing on the violent scale of most of Meadows� previous pics like �England� or �Dead Man�s Shoes.�  Instead, final note is one of gentle uplift and makes sense of the film�s appearance in Berlin�s kid-film Generation Kplus section, although in quality, it far exceeds some of the films in this year�s competish. 
Per filmmakers at post-screening talk, pic was financed by Eurostar, whose London-Paris intercity service and new terminal at St. Pancras station play a prominent role here. However, pic�s naturalism keeps it from feeling like a commercial for Eurostar, even when one character talks about how impressive the high-speed service is through the Channel Tunnel.   
Tech credits, along with thesping and helming, are of excellent standard. Acoustic score by singer-songwriter Gavin Clarke hits right notes in every sense.

The title of Shane Meadows 's Somers Town   refers to the bleak, working-class neighborhood that lies in the shadow of London's St. Pancras train station, where, in the fall of 2007, the Eurostar  train company launched a new high-speed rail line to Paris. In an unconventional marketing move, Eurostar commissioned Meadows—the cinema's poet laureate of hardscrabble Midlands living—to make a film for the occasion, which began as a short and evolved into this 70-minute feature.
That fact alone may guarantee Somers Town  a footnote in film history as the apotheosis of product placement. But the film is considerably softer in its sales tactic than the feature-length FedEx  commercial known as Cast Away , and Transformers ' effort to jump-start the U.S. auto industry. Whereas Hollywood  long ago sold its soul to corporate benefactors, Meadows has managed to retain his.
It's hardly surprising that a train company would want to get into the movie business, given that trains have seduced a century of moviemakers, from the Lumière brothers to Tony Scott , with their intrinsically cinematic motion. But trains figure curiously little in Somers Town , whose primary characters have already arrived at their chosen destination—London—when the movie begins, yet remain very much in transit, unmoored, searching for a sense of home. They include Tomo (the wonderful Thomas Turgoose , who was the skinhead initiate in Meadows's previous This Is England ), a spirited Nottingham  youth who comes to the big city with all his worldly possessions on his back, and Marek (newcomer Piotr Jagiello ), a Polish teen whose recently divorced dad is one of the laborers building the new Eurostar line.
The two boys' paths cross by chance after Tomo is beaten and robbed, with Marek agreeing to surreptitiously feed and lodge the homeless, penniless Tomo behind the back of his frequently drunk father. On the subject of his own family—or whether he even has any—Tomo says only that he didn't want to become another dead-end nobody in a dead-end town. And so, with a chutzpah that far outstrips his modest physical size, he has journeyed to this great global crossroads in search of a better life.
Meadows, who comes out of the same tradition of British social realism as Mike Leigh  and Ken Loach , is nearly as discreet about his social agenda as he is his corporate shilling. Although there's an attendant gloom to the film, emphasized by the desolate black-and-white cinematography of Natasha Braier , the tone is airy, even whimsical, as his two rudderless adolescents roam about their forgotten corner of the city, engaging in a bit of Chaplin-esque slapstick with a bag of stolen laundry, working odd jobs for a hucksterish street vendor, and making clumsy passes at the slightly older French waitress (Elisa Lasowski ) in a neighborhood café. Marek, an aspiring photographer, snaps her picture, and, in one scene that tips its hat to the playfulness of the French New Wave, the two young suitors chauffeur her home in a repurposed wheelchair.
Without ever trivializing his characters' meager circumstances or resorting to the rags-to-riches fantasy of Slumdog Millionaire , Meadows has made a lovely film about the ability of the imagination to offset the harshness of reality. Somewhere amid all the apocalyptic doomsaying about globalization, he locates a hopefulness—perhaps genuine, perhaps illusory—that has also come with the disappearing borders (and, OK, fast trains) of the new Europe. If only all commercials were this pleasurable, God might never have had to invent TiVo .
