 In 1977 Nicky Barnes, by some accounts — his own, for sure — the most powerful drug dealer in Harlem, posed for the cover of The New York Times Magazine. The headline, “Mr. Untouchable,” is now the title of a flashy new documentary directed by Marc Levin that opens, conveniently, a week before “American Gangster,” Ridley Scott’s epic rendering of the career of one of Mr. Barnes’s rivals.  Dressing up for magazine photographers and flaunting his success at evading punishment was probably an unwise display of hubris on Mr. Barnes’s part. Once the New York Police Department, the Department of Justice and President Jimmy Carter saw the article, Mr. Barnes’s days as a free man were numbered, and before long he was in prison. But the nickname nonetheless remains apt, since Mr. Barnes, interviewed extensively for “Mr. Untouchable,” seems untouched by remorse, regret or second thoughts.  And Mr. Levin’s film, though it duly includes testimony from police officers, prosecutors and journalists who covered the crime beat in those bad old New York days — how filmmakers seem to miss them — takes a tolerant, even admiring view of its subject. Old photographs show him as a stylish, smiling fixture of the social scene. In the present-day interviews, his face is shadowed (he has been a protected government witness for many years), and he sits at a boardroom table like a corporate chief executive. The camera zooms in on his hands, noting the heavy gold watch and pinkie ring and observing as he fondles carefully selected props, including stacks of money and a single bullet.  Mr. Barnes comes across as thoughtful, well read (Machiavelli is a particular favorite) and utterly ruthless. His associates recall the glory days of the Harlem heroin syndicate, lauding his business acumen and his unsentimental, brutal manner of dealing with rivals and turncoats. There is some acknowledgment of the terrible effects of the drug trade on residents of Harlem and other poor New York neighborhoods, but for the most part “Mr. Untouchable” clings to the standard hip-hop mythology of the pusher as entrepreneur, rebel, celebrity and folk hero.  That narrative is complicated somewhat by the fact that Mr. Barnes was also a snitch, rolling over on his underlings, his partners and even the mother of his children once it became clear that he could no longer run his business from the penitentiary. The survivors express shock and betrayal — is there no honor among thieves? — but Mr. Barnes just laughs, the mirthless chuckle of a true capitalist hustler who will use anyone, criminal, lawyer or documentary filmmaker, to serve his own interests.  “Mr. Untouchable” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for pervasive drug content, strong language, some violent images and brief nudity.  MR.

Alternately seduced and repelled by its subject, the garish and power-hungry Harlem gangster and '70s cocaine kingpin Nicky Barnes, "Mr. Untouchable" is one seriously confused documentary. Since the film tries to couch itself as too hip to deliver a cautionary anti-drug message while surveying the collapse of an egomaniacal big shot, its sentiments toward Barnes -- vicious thug? Superfly with bigger guns and bigger bank? -- are visibly torn. While Magnolia's fall release may pull in "Scarface" fans, final B.O. tally isn't likely to be north of the average theatrical doc, though vid and cable will prove a boost.
Intro announces Barnes as a "Godfather"-type figure repping criminal heights (or depths) for the Harlem community, and notes that Barnes remains in hiding with $1 million on his head. How he got to this point is the primary concern of director Marc Levin's ("Slam," "The Last Party"), and what's perhaps most surprising about "Mr. Untouchable" is how uninteresting Barnes' rise to power actually is.
His violent childhood quickly passed over and unexamined, Barnes took advantage of a central shift in African-American life in the late '60s/early '70s, when an increasingly radicalized and politicized population was hobbled by both a static legit economy and a suddenly explosive heroin and cocaine biz. It's indicative of pic's shallowness that Levin completely ignores the underpinnings of what allowed a Barnes to burst on the scene.
Even a crucial paradox -- that those who bring drugs into poor communities are deliberately feeding poverty and black underdevelopment -- is barely addressed here, and when it is, it's done in a cagey manner by Barnes himself, who's filmed in silhouette and in fragmented shots that reveal flashy jewelry and wads of dough. If ever a doc made a living crook look slick and movie-star potent, it's this one.
In ways never fully explained, Barnes gained a rep as having "the best powder" in Harlem, and, even as a junkie, gradually began attracting young guys with a taste for crime and easy money, like Joseph "Jazz" Hayden, Leon "Scrap" Batts and Frank James. A prison stint did nothing but help Barnes build his organization, dubbed "the Council," which exploited an extraordinary uptick in drug traffic from 1970-1975. 
Pic makes liberal use of quotes on the amoral uses of power from Niccolo Machiavelli's "The Prince," Barnes' favorite read behind bars. Like a good student, Barnes took Machiavelli's principles to heart, purchasing his drug supply from the Italian-American Mafia and selling it directly on the street without the usual middlemen. For DEA agent Don Ferrarone (one of pic's several law-enforcement talking heads), this was the key to Barnes' rise to dominance.
Key to his fall, per the title, was Barnes' certitude that he couldn't get caught, which in turn fed his willingness to strike a cocky pose for a 1977 New York Times Magazine cover story written by Fred Ferretti. When DEA undercover agent Louie Diaz got Hayden to talk on tape, feds had what they needed to put Barnes behind bars on conspiracy charges. (Perhaps pic's lowest touch is actually granting time to Barnes' ex-wife Thelma and others to complain he was somehow unfairly convicted.)
Even more damaging to the film's p.o.v. is how it frames Barnes' eventual betrayal -- "ratting" on his associates and turning state's evidence out of vengeance -- as some kind of rough justice for his conviction. Even though Hayden and others denounce Barnes as a coward and a snitch, and even admit what they did was wrong, pic gives Barnes (now in the feds' witness protection program) the nasty and possibly victorious last word: Screw with me, and I'll screw you back -- only worse.
Original elements here are little more than blandly filmed interview segs, excepting those with Barnes, whose hidden face recalls the depiction of Jesus in old-time biblical epics. Editor Emir Lewis wraps the interviews, archival footage and photos into a funky package (abetted by Curtis Mayfield tunes and other period music), heightening the bothersome sense that this horrific period is somehow worthy of nostalgic regard.

Interspersed with quotes from Machiavelli , blaxploitation anthems, non sequitur B-roll footage of New York City in the '70s, and the occasional black-and-white dramatization, Mr. Untouchable  is a fascinating first-person account of drug kingpin and ruthless gangster Nicky Barnes , whose outrageous story of rise, rule, rage, and revenge requires no such stylistic filler. Called everything from the Al Capone  of Harlem to the titular monikerby which he was christened in a New York Times Magazine   cover story that led, some argue, to his downfallBarnes (who is portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr.  in the upcoming true-crime opus American Gangster ) has been a member of the witness-protection program since 1998, after giving up every one of the henchmen (and henchwomen) in his multimillion-dollar heroin empire. Shown in either master-of-the-universe silhouette or from the (expensively cuff-linked) wrists down, Barnes tells his story alongside an impressive number of the players, from the former "council" members that he helped put in jail to the reporters, DEA  informants, police officers, and prosecutors who put him there first. Also on hand is Barnes's defense attorney of yore, David "Mighty Whitey" Breitbart, whose attitude encapsulates the uneasy balance that this film strikes between telling the straight story and glorifying a stone-cold snake in the grass. Still bragging about getting his client off for murder and drug trafficking all these years later, Breitbart recalls being made an "honorary nigger" for his trouble with a glee that would take the spring out of even Superfly's step.
