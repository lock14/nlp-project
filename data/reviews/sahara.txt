Based on the popular Clive Cussler book, Sahara
 may be asinine, but it�s also goofy good fun, a presummer popcorn actioner that strips away Cussler�s veneer of rank conservatism and Boys� Own
 shenanigans in favor of Seventies-era classic rock (you know you�re in the presence of goofiness when Steppenwolf�s schlocky "Magic Carpet Ride" soundtracks a key scene) and hamfisted buddy-movie clich�s. The film also, near notoriously, casts Austin percussion legend McConaughey as Dirk Pitt, the novelist�s Yankified James Bond-lite, a strapping, bronzed American archeologist who works for a redundantly acronymed outfit called NUMA (the National Underwater and Marine Agency) when he�s not off chasing the ladies. Cussler, apparently, was none too pleased with the choice and has since been embroiled in a legal scuffle with Paramount regarding the direction this planned trilogy should take. Relax, Clive, your fan base is secure, even though with McConaughey and Zahn � as Pitt�s wisecracking right-hand-man Al Giordino � in the leads this might as well have been rechristened Romancing the Stoned
. The plot has Pitt searching for a fabled Confederate iron-clad ship that vanished with all hands and a gutful of CSA gold. Through a series of events too circuitous to recount here, Pitt and Giordino find themselves in darkest Africa, where they team up with WHO field researcher Eva Rojas (Cruz), who is hot on the trail of a deadly contagion that could, if left unchecked, cross the Atlantic and obliterate McDonald�s supply of whitefish filets in record time. With an able assist from crusty sea-salt Admiral Sandecker (Macy in a truly bizarre bit of casting), Pitt and Company not only save the whales but the world as well, and if that comes as a surprise, you haven�t been getting out to many movies lately. Backhanded compliments aside, Sahara
 is generally quite fun, an updated version of the grandly scatterbrained old Republic serials that plateaus before it manages anything approaching Indiana Jones
� rugged charm. McConaughey, miscast though Cussler may believe him to be, is fine in a (presumably unintentional) parodic sort of way; his roiling abs and easy, raffish grin suit director Eisner�s cheesily gung-ho vibe, and though it�ll likely torment Cussler no end to hear it, his Pitt looks as though he�d be just as comfortable piloting a Greenpeace inflatable as he is knocking the stuffing out of wayward European industrialists. Zahn, to his credit, keeps up with the proceedings, adding his patented half-mast slacker panache to a film already bursting at the seams with big, dumb fun. Only Cruz�s Eva comes off as an addendum to the proceedings: Her bedroom tussle with Pitt notwithstanding, she�s exists in Cussler�s world as a bosomy foil to Dirk�s runaway machismo (and looks damn good doing it). White hats and black hats abound in both Cussler's and Eisner�s worldviews, which makes it easy to hiss the villain and cheer the hero should you be so inclined. Just don�t go expecting complex moral and ethical quandaries and you�ll likely never think of Ishtar
 even once.


Bye-bye, Eisner. Hello . . . Son of Eisner?
Yes, the Eisner name is in the spotlight yet again. Only this time it's Breck Eisner, 30-something scion of departing Disney CEO Michael Eisner, and you shouldn't bother scouring back issues of Variety if you've never heard of the unheralded young director, because his debut feature film, ''Sahara," isn't going to make him a mogul anytime soon.
In fact, ''Sahara" is such an undistinguished action-adventure effort that its fleet of more than a dozen producers should probably be grateful for all the gossip and controversy this project has generated, starting with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed by Clive Cussler, who wrote the novel on which the movie's script is based. That disjointed script is credited to no fewer than four writers at this point, and Cussler (who claims his final approval rights were ignored) doesn't appear to be a fan of any of them.
It's not hard to see why.
Starring Matthew McConaughey, Steve Zahn, and Penelope Cruz, ''Sahara" comes to the screen as a formulaic and ''family-friendly" action-adventure film that's good-natured enough to entertain here and there, but that otherwise loses its way long before the characters complete their implausible quest.
Beginning as the Civil War tale of a Confederate ironclad battleship that may or may not have navigated from the coast of Virginia to the waters of Africa's Niger River before disappearing with valuable cargo aboard, the ''Sahara" story quickly jumps to the present, where it becomes ''The Dukes of Hazzard" on safari, complete with a Southern-fried rock soundtrack.
McConaughey plays Dirk Pitt, a Navy SEAL turned adventurer and salvage expert, who in this installment of Cussler's long-running series is obsessed with the legend of the Dixie warship. His wisecracking sidekick is boyhood buddy Al Giordino (Zahn), ready to hurl himself into harm's way at the first sign of trouble.
While the tanned, toned McConaughey is a credit to his sleeveless shirts, he's still not the riveting combination of Indiana Jones and James Bond that the story would have us fall for (nor anything like the cerebral Dirk that a miscast Richard Jordan presented in 1980's ''Raise the Titanic," for that matter).
And Al, beefy in book form, is drawn here as the cuddly, unkillable equivalent of a cartoon Care Bear.
While in Africa on a salvage mission for a company run by one retired Admiral Sandecker (William H. Macy), Dirk discovers proof that his ironclad holy grail may indeed be nearby, so he and Al point the admiral's powerboat in the direction of Mali and crank up ''Sweet Home Alabama."
Along for the ride are nerdy crewmate Rudi (Rainn Wilson, of TV's ''Six Feet Under" and ''The Office"), and activist-physician Eva Rojas (Cruz), who's part of a medical team that hopes to find the source of a deadly epidemic that's quickly spreading downriver.
The bad guys chasing the doctors -- and, by extension, Dirk -- are working for an African tyrant (Lennie James) and a shady industrialist (Lambert Wilson) who need to stop the intruders from discovering the true nature of the epidemic, which has far-reaching environmental, cultural, and political consequences.
So cue the exotic-location fisticuffs and all manner of things exploding, plus a ridiculous pile of coincidences and over-the-top escapes that even by action standards are not to be believed. Only don't expect onscreen sparks between Cruz and McConaughey, despite their real-life postproduction coziness, because it's rare that they even get close enough to compare teeth whiteners.
What does provide some excitement is the polished look of the film -- especially early on, before you become exasperated with its muddled story line and endless contrivances.
In a snappy opening sequence, the camera flits like a housefly over all the important objects in Dirk's cluttered office, and bustling ports and vibrant landscapes take on music-video slickness. It's nothing new but it is done stylishly, which is something.
Let's be honest, criticism was bound to dog ''Sahara" from the moment that Eisner, with his limited résumé in television and commercials, signed on to direct this big-budget project after several better-known directors bowed out. In the end, the thing that Cussler's fans will probably object to most is the nonsensical way ''Sahara" manhandles his story, and leaves out an entire Abraham Lincoln subplot that might have lent the whole Confederate warship odyssey a point.
Is that Eisner's fault, or simply his unfortunate inheritance? It's a debate to be continued.


         It might be useful for filmmakers to note that with popcorn movies, the audience's suspension of disbelief is going to dissipate in direct proportion to any attempt to call attention to Serious Issues. It's probably a bad thing if the synopsis begins to sound like the table of contents from last week's Time magazine.
 
  A case in point is "Sahara," an updated adaptation of Clive Cussler's 1992 novel featuring his serialized, formulized maritime adventurer Dirk Pitt. A contemporary seeker of historical treasures — think Indiana Jones with military training — Pitt searches for the Texas, a long-lost Confederate battleship, across the grand desert of North Africa in what was the 11th of nearly two dozen books devoted to his exploits. The movie version dumps the novel's President Lincoln assassination subplot, cannibalism and an Amelia Earhart-like aviatrix in favor of emphasizing references to the World Health Organization, ecological disaster and African warlords, all of which may firmly plunge Pitt into the geopolitical complexities of the 21st century but make it increasingly difficult to buy into the hero's implausible derring-do.
 


         






    More's the pity, because "Sahara" has the makings of a good, old-fashioned, big-budget joy ride. Matthew McConaughey was born to play this type of character with his roguish swagger and puckish grin, and he dives into the part with impressive vigor. He and the incalculably valuable Steve Zahn, as Pitt's sidekick Al Giordino, have terrific chemistry as lifelong buddies and ex-Navy SEALS whose skill sets perfectly complement one another and provide nearly all of the movie's high points.
 
  The initially central plot involving the trail of the mysteriously disappeared Civil War-era ironclad leading to West Africa and then north into the Sahara is an intriguing one, but any suspense is diluted by the incongruous parallel story of Penélope Cruz's WHO doctor (not to be confused with Doctor Who) searching for the source of a plague-like illness. The story lines eventually converge, turning the Texas into a mere plot device and causing us to wonder why we should be concerned with any of this in the first place.
 
  Breck Eisner, son of former Disney mogul Michael and something of a protégé of Steven Spielberg, for whom he directed an episode of the miniseries "Taken," guides "Sahara's" big action set pieces with assurance, but would have been better served by a tighter script. Though the visual nods to "Lawrence of Arabia" are appreciated and the film is well-paced, it is overlong at more than two hours and fails to meld its disparate elements.
 
  Credited screenwriters Thomas Dean Donnelly, Joshua Oppenheimer, John C. Richards and James V. Hart give McConaughey and Zahn some decent throwaway repartee, but the rest of the dialogue is deadly dull. In boiling down Cussler's massive, 500-plus pages, they and presumably a phalanx of uncredited scribes have concocted a stagnant stew of clichéd storytelling, cardboard supporting characters (with the exception of William H. Macy's tough retired admiral) and superficial references to current events.
 
  Sure, Indiana Jones battled Nazis in "Raiders of the Lost Ark," but at a distance of more than 35 years. It's not that "Sahara" takes itself too seriously, it's just that placing Pitt in the center of momentous world problems amid smug platitudes like "Nobody cares about Africa" simply exacerbates the story's ridiculousness and anachronistically simple problem-solving. It's a little hard to have silly fun when you are constantly being reminded that "Hotel Rwanda" and similar stories have been playing out down the road.

Even a Clive Cussler newbie who wouldn't know prototypical Cussler adventurer Dirk Pitt from prototypical porno adventurer Dirk Diggler will know that something's odd about Dirk as played by Matthew McConaughey in the lunar tract of  action geography called Sahara . For one thing, isn't Dirk  the daring, resourceful, fun-loving, life-guzzling, world-traveling, deep-sea-treasure-hunting hero of so many Cussler novels  supposed to have a personality? For another, did Cussler really specify that Pitt's desert head scarves should match his Aegean blue eyes at all times?
I'd wager that the answers are yes and no. This insanely busy, exceedingly long, and sometimes  endearingly preposterous rendering has simply gotten the directions reversed in its insistence on sticking only to where men-who-make-adventure-flicks have gone before. Operating on the assumption that the globe-hopping plot works by itself  heck, keeping up with the itinerary is logistical challenge enough  the four-man writing team and dashingly named director Breck Eisner invest all their bombastic energy in maneuvering the players from A to Z: This is a story that opens on an ironclad battleship off the coast of Virginia during the Civil War and ends in the deserts of Mali (scenery courtesy of Morocco), in a toxic nuclear-waste site operated by a greedy (and, for good measure, French) industrialist played by all-purpose French villain Lambert Wilson.
In between, as Dirk and his indispensable, joke-cracking, never-gets-the-girl best friend and wingman, Al Giordino (Steve Zahn), poke around looking for a lost ironclad fabled to have drifted to Africa, brilliant World Health Organization doctor Eva Rojas (Penélope Cruz, flattened by the Hollywood steamroller) is also nosing around Africa, looking to contain and treat a possible plague; she doesn't let a mask cover her Cover Girl beauty, but at least she occasionally tugs on latex gloves. Dirk meets Eva cute when he rescues her from an attempted assassination, and the two beam their magnificent white teeth at one another in a semaphore of pulchritude. Dirk meets not-so-handsome warlords. Eva meets tribal chieftains. Al makes jokes. Dirk and Eva find the common  denominator in their separate adventure agendas. Dirk and Al's eccentric, avuncular boss, Admiral Sandecker (William H. Macy), shows up to worry about his employees. Personality? Chemistry? A sense of real moviemaking delight in the wanton bravado of Cussler's La-Z-Boy-thrill derring-do? In Sahara , they've all been reduced to Zahn's charming moments as a second-banana action hero. Every now and then, Al flashes Dirk a grin that says, ''Yeah, fine, that head scarf looks good on you. Now can't we please have some fun?''

t may not be "Raiders of the Lost Ark," but "Sahara," the screen adaptation of Clive Cussler's sprawling African adventure yarn, is a movie that keeps half a brain in its head while adopting the amused, cocky smirk of the Indiana Jones romps. A fusion of old and new, it both is and isn't a delirious escape into adventure-serial heaven. Amid its madcap derring-do, the movie inserts clear, simple alarms about environmental protection, African despotism, global interdependence and bureaucratic cowardice. The movie's dressing up of an old-fashioned adventure fantasy in contemporary threads is an experiment in juxtaposition that gains in assurance as the film bounds along. Given the grim news these days of African nations ground to dust under the boots of ruthless, feuding warlords, the film's caricatured vision of greed, oppression and misery in parts of Africa doesn't feel entirely like a caricature. Ultimate real-life horror, after all, is a grotesque cartoon. The two-hour-plus film has the timing and stamina of a marathon runner. As "Sahara" careens between swashbuckling silliness and semi-serious comment, it builds up reserves of energy and good will that pay off when it bursts into its final sprint, a rootin'-tootin' 21-gun finale as satisfying as it is preposterous. "Sahara" is the sure-handed directorial debut of Breck Eisner (son of Michael), who maintains strict control of an oversize story (the novel runs to 700 pages) whose multiple plots could easily have splintered into an incomprehensible tangle. The screenplay, credited to four writers, allows you to follow the multinational crew of treasure hunters, warlords, tribal chiefs and officials from various global agencies as they gallivant across Western Africa (the movie was filmed mostly in Morocco) without losing your way. What starts out as a treasure hunt turns into a desperate attempt to forestall an environmental catastrophe one character calls "the Chernobyl of the Atlantic." Keeping things clear in a movie this capacious isn't easy, as evidenced by the increasing numbers of Hollywood tent poles clad in epic drag that don't make even a token bid for coherence (think only of the "Mummy" films) and are content to splat themselves onto the screen like reeking pools of regurgitated junk food. "Sahara" may be the ultimate test of Matthew McConaughey's still-unrealized potential to enter Hollywood's magic circle. If this movie can't propel the 35-year-old Texan actor into Harrison Ford's $20 million trekking boots, nothing can, and the longstanding heir apparent will never be king. His character, Dirk Pitt, an unflappably game treasure hunter obsessed with finding a Confederate ironclad ship that disappeared at the end of the Civil War and may have landed in Africa, epitomizes Rhett Butler Lite. Twinkling and sinewy, his rakish insolence accented by a mustache, Mr. McConaughey's Dirk is the Flower of Southern Manhood, Texan-style, a fearless all-American pirate with a keen sense of humor and a social conscience. While watching "Sahara," I appreciated his charming performance, but I also kept asking myself which particular quality on the checklist of essential superstar attributes might explain his inability so far to crack the magic circle and decided it must be his voice. His vocal twang may be a little too high and sharp and inflected with a Woody Harrelson whine for him to convey the unassailable gravitas of a mythic action hero. In "Sahara," the star is romantically matched with Pen�lope Cruz, playing Eva Rojas, a fearless, fiery-eyed doctor for the World Health Organization. The movie shrewdly avoids forcing the pair to certify their chemistry with phony midaction clinches. That each saves the other's life more than once should speak for itself. Once again, Ms. Cruz's fiery physical intensity goes only so far in compensating for her language barrier, but most of her sparse dialogue is watered-down doctor talk. Dirk meets Eva in Lagos, Nigeria, where he leads a crew salvaging Nigerian relics from a vessel operated by the National Underwater Marine Agency. She is there to investigate the source of a possible plague that may emanate from the Niger River, the same waterway the ironclad ship Dirk dreams of finding may have traveled two centuries earlier. When Eva finds evidence that Mali, already torn by civil war, may be the source of the plague, she is menaced by a hooded agent dispatched by that country's reigning warlord. In the nick of time, Dirk comes to the rescue and takes her aboard the marine agency ship. The expedition's French corporate sponsor, Yves Massarde (Lambert Wilson), slowly emerges as the film's conflicted villain, a do-gooder contaminated by greed. After Eva and her colleagues disobey orders and sneak into Mali, she is again rescued by Dirk and his wisecracking sidekick, Al Giordino (Steve Zahn). The treasure hunt is put on hold while the three intrepid adventurers uncover a toxic-waste nightmare that could escalate into a global catastrophe. Even with order so strictly imposed, "Sahara" has more story than it can comfortably accommodate. It brashly, shrewdly pretends otherwise. As it lights out into Indiana Jones territory, it appreciates the African landscapes with an adventurer's discriminating eye. The transitions between action (an early speedboat battle crackles with wit and energy) and wisecracking banter (Mr. McConaughey's Dirk and Mr. Zahn's Al, swapping time-honored jokes, make natural sidekicks) are seamless. A robust soundtrack (by Clint Mansell) seasoned with Southern rock 'n' roll and African pop underlines the jaunty mood. It's all sleight of hand, of course, but "Sahara" lopes into the distance with the easygoing swagger of a con man who has just pulled off a $100 million scam. "Sahara" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some violence, disturbing scenes of illness and strong language.

Saddled with more industry/celebrity baggage than a high-class safari voyage, "Sahara" is a rousing and only occasionally ridiculous adventure yarn that craftily updates and condenses author Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt thriller to assume that auds actually know something about Africa and the global environment. Pitt's slightly Quixotic quest for a missing Confederate ironclad ship intersects with a race to stop a toxic catastrophe in West and Saharan Africa -- to say nothing of evil Malian warlords, nasty French corporate thieves and a U.N. doctor full of derring-do -- and the combination points to more promising B.O. in the U.S. and abroad than might have been expected. 
The real test will be if the independently financed $100 million production draws numbers that compel Dirk Pitt sequels, even though there's nothing in pic's denouement that contains the built-in expectations of another episode. The first test has already been passed: Whether there's enough onscreen to make one forget that the director is Breck (son of Michael) Eisner, in his feature debut; that Cussler has taken the producers to court claiming that an unauthorized version of the script was lensed; that there's no way to condense Cussler's massive 700-page-plus tome into two hours; and that co-stars Matthew McConaughey and Penelope Cruz fell in love on the set.
None of this matters, it turns out, since the adaptation of the novel briskly and wittily brings the action and characters together and makes African politics and social conditions a very real backdrop for antics that make Pitt (McConaughey) a younger-generation Indiana Jones. Even more encouraging, as father Michael's exec star is fading, Breck Eisner shows himself to be a solid helmer of complex and beautifully staged action sequences with a sure ear for character interplay and an exact eye for glorious widescreen framing with nods to images from "Lawrence of Arabia."
Prelude during the 1865 Union siege of Richmond, Va., briefly but explosively traces how the last remaining Confederate ironclad, the Texas, managed to slip beyond Northern cannons on the James River. Swift transitions between this fine set piece, a title sequence that neatly establishes Dirk's work as a treasure hunter and his lifelong friendship with Al Giordano (Steve Zahn) and a swooping camera entry into Lagos, Nigeria, indicate this is a movie on a mission.
In Lagos, World Health Organization doc Ana Rojas (Cruz) and assistant Frank (Glynn Turman) are hunting for the source of what appears to be a plague breakout somewhere along the Niger River. She is prey herself, as a hooded man clearly wants her dead, until Dirk comes to the rescue in an effectively dizzying scene that avoids the meet-cute cliches. Ana finds herself aboard a vessel commanded by Admiral Sandecker (William H. Macy) and operated by the National Underwater Marine Agency (NUMA), but Dirk's the star of the ship, proudly salvaging an ancient Nigerian reliquary.
Within minutes, Ana has bonded with Dirk, shady corporate sponsor Yves Massarde has made his presence felt, Al has shown why he's never going to be the guy who gets the girl and a gold Confederate coin has suddenly appeared and spurred Dirk into action. Convinced that the coin's presence in West Africa means the Texas must be near, Dirk commands one of the admiral's spiffy speedboats and takes Al and nerdy cohort Rudi (Rainn Wilson) along for the ride.
Mechanically, "Sahara" is as sleek as the admiral's boat, hurtling along from one expertly shot (by Seamus McGarvey) and edited (by Andrew MacRitchie) action set piece to another, with just enough time-outs for brief but suitable character developments and insights to generate a strong sense of urgency to the heroes' efforts. Unfortunately, Cussler's nagging habit for having the white man rescue the black man overwhelms the story for a long stretch. Balancing the gravitas of a story about the dire ecological threat of toxic waste is the light and frolicsome banter and near-escapes enjoyed by Dirk and Al, whose usual greeting before the action starts is the disarming "Hi! How ya doin'?" McConaughey and Zahn work like a fine double-play combination, the star regularly stepping back so the sidekick can have his moment. Surprisingly (especially for fans of the lovebirds), McConaughey and Cruz rarely have a quiet moment together and never steam up the lens in this PG-13 outing, playing characters driven to do their job first and fool around later.
Firmly slated as Hollywood's first choice for Euro-baddies, Wilson actually expresses shock at the eco-havoc his greed could unleash, thinking all along that he could generate solar power by burning the mucky waste and make money at the same time.
He's a bad man with good intentions, which is more than can normally be expected from a popcorn programmer, just as it is to see Africans rid themselves of one of their worst. It's fair to expect ultra-pro production values that the pic packs, but to see Africa taken even halfway seriously on the bigscreen is a real thrill.

Sahara  is many things, but it is not a movie. It is the skull-splitting cacophony of 21 producers and four screenwriters (that we know about, anyway) standing in the same room shouting into their cell phones. It is an expectorant hey-kiddo slap on the back for director Breck "Son of Michael" Eisner, who learned everything he knows from playing Tomb Raider, and for smirking star Matthew McConaughey , who gets top billing as a trust fund hippie adventurer plus an executive credit via his company, j.k. livin (as in "Just Keep Livin'," even if your intestines have been grated by a deadly waterborne virus and further perforated by bullets, but more on that later). Professional treasure hunters McConaughey and Steve Zahn  seek an ironclad Confederate ship which has somehow lodged itself under the deserta scenario that sails against everything I was taught in earth science class, and which invites lots of inaccurate gunfire from assorted tribal baddies. Yet Sahara  does not exist in space or timewe are told that, just 100 years ago, the titular sandlot was a verdant, river-necklaced paradise, which would place us somewhere in the Neolithic era, but we also see that civil war rages in Mali , which fast-forwards us to the '90s. (Eisner & Co. shot in Morocco , which in production terms is to generic battle-torn arid locales what Toronto is to major American cities.)
Sahara  is above all a testament to family values as conceived by Bristol Bay Productions  (brainchild of sports franchise billionaire Philip Anschutz ), which aims to, according to the press notes, "tell uplifting stories appropriate for audiences of all ages." Sahara  measures this uplift in machine gun rounds, explosive tonnage, and the body count of dead and dying Africans piled on various dirt floors over whom W.H.O.  go-getter Penélope Cruz  can fret. Her pursuit of an Ebola-like plague adds a convenient humanitarian gloss to the boys' bloody frolics, and like Monica Bellucci  as the sultry doctor without borders in Tears of the Sun , Cruz's bouncing cleavage swells with world-saving ambition.
