 The overripe morsel who gets batted around in the Japanese absurdithon “The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai” looks like she was conjured up by a teenage boy in dangerous hormonal overdrive. As gently plumped as a freshly cooked hot dog and about as intelligent, Sachiko Hanai (Emi Kuroda) works as a prostitute servicing men who tend to yell for their mothers at inappropriate moments. It’s a living or something like it, though mostly it’s just a suitable setup for the ensuing clutter of soft-core political parody, hard-core narrative nonsense, breezy sexism, junky visuals and penny-ante surrealism.  One night, a stray bullet lodges in the middle of Sachiko’s forehead, instantly transforming her into a genius — a super-randy, superagreeable genius that is, one who can expound on Kant’s “Critique of Pure Reason” while bouncing about in her birthday suit. You see, the bullet in Sachiko’s noggin — as some crudely rendered cartoons helpfully illustrate — has triggered hitherto untapped mental powers, turning her into a brainiac.  Now able to devour a philosophy tome in a single sitting, her white panties flashing, Sachiko has basically morphed into Superslut,  with her amazing powers now located equally above the neck and below the navel. In other words, she is somewhat more human than a blowup doll, though still as hot to trot as a Shetland in the Sahara.  Directed, in a manner of speaking, by Meike Mitsuru, “The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai” apparently started out as just another soft-core item, or what the Japanese call a pink film, but evolved into something more ambitious, sort of. Certainly it doesn’t look or play out like the typical American pay-TV fodder.  Although our plucky star spends much of her onscreen time undressed (not so her male partners), the film differs from pornography in one crucial respect: It doesn’t seem to have been created for the usual instrumental purpose. Or maybe it’s just me. In lieu of erotic and visual pleasure, “The Glamorous Life” instead offers regularly timed bouts of pro-forma coitus, a North Korean spy and some smutty weirdness involving a clone of the current President Bush’s trigger finger. Don’t ask because I won’t tell.

"The Glamorous Life of Sachiko Hanai" tells poignant tale of a prostitute whose bullet-wounded brain turns her into an intellectual superwoman surfing waves of nymphomania, hallucinogenic seizures, and the psychic control of George W. Bush's cloned finger. If outrageous concepts were all, this latest fillip in the oft-eccentric history of Japanese "pink" (softcore sexploitation) cinema would be genius. But the crazy ideas in Takao Nakano's script just fitfully amuse under Mitsuru Meike's draggy direction. Pic will attract diehard cultists on DVD. 
Basically a prank in need of Takashi Miike's delirious energy, the film has Emi Kuroda as Sachiko, a young sex worker who specializes in private tutor scenarios. ("Horny Home Tutor: Teacher's Love Juice" is the alternative monicker given the pic's much-trimmed, more-sex; less-surrealism cut for the Nippon pink market.) When she gets in the way of a terrorist deal gone awry, her personality suffers changes that bewilder and delight the family of a philosophy professor she moves in with. Meanwhile, an assassin stalks her to regain the cloned presidential digit she's accidentally walked off with. Uninspired staging and pacing manage the near-impossible feat of rendering such lunatic concepts dull.

Expanded by a half-hour from its prior incarnation as a pinku eiga  (or "Pink film," a still-popular breed of Japanese softcore porn that began in the early '60s), the formerly titled Horny Home Tutor: Teacher's Love Juice  is now an apocalyptic political satire. After a grueling day at the office, role-playing prostitute Sachiko Hanai  (Emi Kuroda ) adjourns to a café, where she's suddenly caught in the crossfire between two terroristsone North Korean, the other Middle Easternwhose power meeting has gone awry. Taking a bullet in the head that transforms her into a mathematical genius, Sachiko dazedly walks off, inadver- tently taking with her a lipstick-like cylinder that holds the cloned red finger of George W. Bush . "This is the finger that determines the destiny of the world," barks a Dubya-masked man on a living television straight out of Videodrome , as our glamorous hero is penetrated on a rooftop by her newfound property, thus adhering to the "sex scene every 10 minutes" rule of Pink.
