What's it all about, Alvin? Apparently it's about rebranding a musty old comic conceit for a whole new generation of proto-Willards. The adenoidal animated vermin of Ross Bagdasarian Sr. and Jr. have arrived via CGI in this live-action update/companion to the Bagdasarian family's lengthy r�sum� of rodentia comicus
-related phenomena, the pinnacle of which remains 1958's holiday novelty tune "The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)." There were, to be sure, other points of interest in the careers of the chipmunk sibs � wiseacre Alvin, opthamologically challenged scholar Simon, and nutty cream puff Theodore � but like the diminutive, squeaky-voiced trio, they're not really all that high. I exclude from the Chipmunk Suck List � it should go without saying, but what the hell � the sneering Dada majesty that was 1980's Chipmunk Punk
 LP. The 'Munks were, by that time, hopelessly addicted to helium (in hindsight, clearly the crack of its day), although their cover versions of such first-wave punk icons as Tom Petty and, um, the Knack remain to this day in heavy rotation so long as the Earth keeps spinning. As for Hill's (SpongeBob SquarePants
) Chipmunk tale, however, it's a strictly by-the-numbers affair, aimed in the most generic direction conceivable. Lee plays Dave, a well-intentioned but bumbling songwriter aided and abetted in life and love (and icky-sweet pop music) by My Three Chipmunks. Mr. Show
's Cross is a duplicitous record mogul, who plays nice with Dave while conniving behind his back (boo!), and Richardson is the mutant-model-photographer-chick-thing Dave's all gooey on. Will true love prevail? Will Dave grow a backbone (and some real songwriting talent)? And most important, will Alvin, Simon, and Theodore survive this bland new form of chipmunk mania? They shoot rodents, don't they?


The new, improved, digitalized, hip-hoppified "Alvin and the Chipmunks" hits theaters today. Another precious childhood memory sacked and burned.
Well, hold on. What Mike Myers and company did to "The Cat in the Hat" a few years back - that was sacrilege. The singing chipmunks, by contrast, were disposable pop-culture cheese when they debuted and have remained so through TV series (early '60s and mid-'80s), big-screen versions ("The Chipmunk Adventure" from 1987, may it rest in pieces), remixes ("Chipmunk Punk," 1980), and reissues. There's only so many times you can hear "The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)" before those sped-up rodent harmonies start sounding like dentist drills aimed right at your cerebral cortex.
Blame the late Ross Bagdasarian, who "invented" the chipmunk voices in the 1950s, prompting millions of bored kids to wreck their parents' Bell & Howell tape decks trying to imitate that signature voice. (Today you can get the same effect using computer software. Cheaters.) And blame co-producer Ross Bagdasarian Jr. for extending the family brand into the era of unappetizing digital/ live-action hybrids.
Yes, "Alvin and the Chipmunks," like the "Scooby-Doo" and "Garfield" movies over which it stands as a slight improvement, drops semi-realistic animated critters into a "live" setting, then sits back and considers its job done.
The shocking part is that there are people here who really should know better. Jason Lee, the gifted snarkmaster of "Chasing Amy" and TV's "My Name is Earl," brings his credibility down a few notches by playing Dave Seville, the hapless LA songwriter who discovers three singing, talking chipmunks. Comedian David Cross ("Mr. Show," "Arrested Development") plays the slimy record executive who hijacks the trio in an effort to cash in on their fame.
Gangly rising star Justin Long voices Alvin, the brattiest of the chipmunks. (Matthew Gray Gubler does the honors for brainiac Simon and Jesse McCartney is Theodore, the baby of the bunch.) One of the writers worked on "The Simpsons" and "The Larry Sanders Show"; another wrote for "Ren and Stimpy." The director - oh, wait, the director did the second "Garfield" movie. Never mind.
Anyway, it's to no avail, since the script leans heavily on the pranks and big-eyed cuteness of the li'l guys and leaves the live actors with unfunny dialogue and nothing to do. (Lee sounds hoarse, as if coming off a few days of yelling at his agent.) Still, small children and jaded mallrats will enjoy the choreographed shenanigans, which include the chipmunks dropping a lot of dope top-40 references and indulging in a Hi-NRG dance version of Bagdasarian's classic novelty song "Witch Doctor." (You know it as "Oo Ee Oo Ah Ah Ting Tang Walla Walla Bing Bang.")
Here's what burns me, though: The movie serves up this pandering jive because it's "what the kids want," then says it's bad for them and that our furry heroes would be better off in Dave's loving, low-rent analog world. Like most family movies these days, "Alvin" is torn between the glitz that sells and the homilies that endure. It's a load of Ting Tang Wallet-Wallet Bling Blang.


 Hollywood continues its tired milking of old television properties with “Alvin and the Chipmunks,” a slick updating of the musical-cartoon franchise created by Ross Bagdasarian Sr. in 1958. Remodeled over the years on television and recordings, the ’munks have been given a digital coat of paint this time out, but the movie doesn’t skimp — lasso those nostalgic parents! — on the memories of old.  Jason Lee (doing a perfect “Alvin. Alvin! Alvin!”) plays David Seville, a rejected songwriter who meets the mischievous Alvin, brainy Simon and pudgy Theodore, transplanted tree dwellers who have raided his kitchen. When he discovers their unique vocal harmonies, he’s off to a record executive (a delightfully despicable, movie-stealing David Cross), who whisks the trio away to exploit their talent for all it’s worth.  As fans of the television series know, Dave is the critters’ surrogate dad, and the film concerns his need to embrace that responsibility and save the boys from a showbiz life they’re too young for. The movie gets mileage out of the chestnuts “The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don’t Be Late)” and “Witch Doctor” (you remember: “Oo-ee, oo-ah-ah, ting-tang, walla-walla, bing-bang”), its digs at the music industry and the cheap laughs of the big-beseeching-eye effect of Puss in Boots in the “Shrek” movies.  But, alas, its animated protagonists are egregiously eclipsed by the live-action characters. Despite its shout-outs to the holiday season, this is essentially airplane fodder, not a perennial. Don’t hold your breath waiting for the sequel.  “Alvin and the Chipmunks” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for some mild rude humor.

More than hyperactive enough to engage small fry with microscopic attention spans, "Alvin and the Chipmunks" also has built-in nostalgia appeal for baby-boomer parents and grandparents willing to accept 21st-century remixes of novelty songs and cartoon characters from the 1950s and '60s. This latest mash-up of live-action comedy and CGI shenanigans from helmer Tim Hill ("Garfield: A Tale of Two Kitties") is a harmless and frequently humorous trifle that might be a potent B.O. performer, if only by default, during a holiday season surprisingly short on kidpics. Homevid prospects are huge.
Title characters date back to 1958, when the late musician-songwriter Ross Bagdasarian used then-state-of-the-art recording technology to create high-speed, high-pitched vocals for the chart-topping hits "Witch Doctor" and "The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)." (Pic acknowledges that wonderful year with a long-held shot on a street address.) 
The specific personalities of the chipmunk siblings -- spunky Alvin, brainy Simon and sweetly goofy Theodore -- and their often-exasperated human father figure Dave Seville were more or less solidified in "The Alvin Show," a 1961-'62 animated TV series (in which all four central characters were voiced by Bagdasarian), the template for all things Alvin and/or Chipmunk ever since.
New pic is the chipmunkish equivalent of "Batman Begins," re-imagining the mythos while re-introducing Alvin (voiced by Justin Long), Simon (Matthew Gray Gubler) and Theodore (Jesse McCartney) as madcap forest denizens involuntarily relocated to Los Angeles. They arrive in the right place at the right time -- on the upper branches of a Christmas tree in the lobby of Jett Records world headquarters -- just as struggling songwriter Dave Seville (Jason Lee) once again fails to sell a tune to his increasingly impatient former college roommate, Jett executive Ian Hawk (David Cross).
Judging from what the aud gets to hear, Ian is altogether justified when he suggests Dave might consider a new line of work. But with talking and singing chipmunks to inspire him -- that is, when the furry sprites aren't laying waste to his apartment or undermining his romance of comely neighbor Claire (Cameron Richardson) -- Dave manages to compose and record a potential No. 1 hit. 
Dave's career advancement is temporarily impeded when, in a plot turn that recalls the classic Chuck Jones cartoon "One Froggy Evening," Alvin and his siblings are unable to perform for anyone but Dave. The chipmunks, however, overcome their stage fright, which leads to fame, fortune and their resultant problems.
Working from a script by Jon Vitti, Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi, Hill is less than subtle as he emphasizes themes of family values and paternal responsibility. It doesn't help that, as Lee gives an atypically bland performance as the straight-laced Dave, Cross grabs every scene that isn't bolted to the floor as the shamelessly materialistic and exuberantly snarky Ian. (Early on, Ian looks at the rodent superstars and cracks wise: "Put some clothes on those guys. It's kind of embarrassing.") 
Virtue ultimately triumphs, of course, but until Ian starts behaving in an flagrantly nasty fashion -- and maybe even for a while afterward --- grade-schoolers in the aud likely will think that, hey, the libertine is a lot more fun that the party-pooper.
By this point in the development of f/x trickery, it's not exactly startling to see that "Alvin and the Chipmunks" offers a seamless juxtaposition of live-action and computer-generated elements. But to give credit where it's most certainly due, the pic benefits greatly from the persuasive interaction of human and digital co-stars. 
Lively hip-hop and techno-pop versions of Chipmunk standards only add to the fun. Closing credits are cleverly illustrated with album covers that chart the decades-long development of Alvin and the Chipmunks as musical icons.
