In the '70s, when Sidney Lumet directed Serpico , Dog Day Afternoon , and Network , and later on through The Verdict  and Q&A , you could love his films and still feel that he was an electrifying utilitarian-craftsman more than an artist. His tightly wired dramas of crime, honor, and corruption were rooted in the turmoil of the New York streets, and they caught the big desperation of little men, but there was nothing in them comparable to, say, the red-hot candied camera of Scorsese, the wizardry of Altman. Lumet's films took place under a fluorescent glare, in cruddy police offices and sterile boardrooms; his style was as plain as the talk at a midtown lunch counter, as direct yet haphazard as a misfired gunshot. He would plant the camera in a room and let his actors simmer and explode  the quintessence of brute-force '70s realism. Lumet made teeming, energized, powerful movies, but he made them with prose rather than poetry.
Except that now, in the context of the glitzy, ADD-edited, steroidally pumped spirit of the modern megaplex thriller, that no-frills Lumet style, revived  triumphantly  in his mesmerizing new crime drama, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead , looks like poetry after all. Lumet is now 83, but in Before the Devil  he works with the vigor and cunning and wide-awake elegance of a virtuoso half his age. Those unbroken, slow-burn takes are really so much more than functional; Lumet's camera has become an invisible cage, inviting us to study the behavior of the human animals trapped inside. In the opening, Philip Seymour Hoffman, staring at a hotel mirror, has sex with Marisa Tomei, and if the image is lurid and a bit creepy (how did this Pillsbury Doughguy land that hottie?), their pillow talk creates a noirish afterglow of avarice, fleeting affection, and fear.
The film then cuts to ''The Day of the Robbery,'' at which point we see, played out in high-tension actual time, the holdup of a jewelry store in a suburban shopping mall. It's a crime so low-rent, and one that goes so spectacularly wrong, that this might be a Dog Day Afternoon  that takes place, if possible, even further down the scale of criminal ineptitude. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead  leaps around in time, structuring itself like one of those ''flashy'' post-Tarantino mind-benders, yet as the suspense strays from dank yuppie bars to a rent-a-car office to the swank designer lair of a super-upscale heroin dealer, what happens is so vivid and suck-in-your-breath real that none of it can be written off as a pop fantasy. The chronology isn't just fractured; it's ingeniously layered , as the script, by Kelly Masterson, keeps rotating back to situations we only thought we knew. We never feel we're watching ''criminals'' so much as banal ordinary men who have sunk to the level of acting like criminals. Which is so much scarier, because they could be us.
It's Hoffman's Andy who hatches the heist. He's the payroll manager at a tony Manhattan real estate office, but he's mired in debt, drugs, and a faltering sense of manhood (Tomei is the trophy wife he's scrambling to live up to), so when he taunts his brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke), into going in on a plan that will pay off for both of them, he's the voice of temptation. Hoffman, oozing scabrous charm, finds a gruesome strength in his character's weakness. Andy is a louse, but he knows how to play people, especially the little brother he still regards as a baby. Hank, who works at the same office, is dissolute and divorced, with child-support payments he can't keep up with. Which is why he goes for Andy's scheme: to rip off their parents' jewelry store. It's a ''victimless'' crime the insurance will cover, and that will net 60 grand for each of them, but it's also an act of blasphemy. Before the Devil  is a zeitgeist movie, rooted in the new middle-class money hunger.
I'm not going to give away any more, because this is a movie you want to discover. You want to savor its bad behavior, its crime that blows up in everyone's face  and, most potently, its tale of a family crashing on the rocks of its destiny. Hoffman has become a cathartic actor, who taps his darkest sides without protection, as if to say: Admit it, you all know this pain too. Late in the movie, he has the quietest trashing-the-room tantrum I've ever seen, and it's one of the most memorable. He and Hawke, who makes Hank a jumble of duplicity and childlike trust, give seismic performances, and so does Albert Finney as the dad who towers over both of them. Before the Devil Knows You're Dead  may be the only movie I've seen that earns comparison to both a great film noir and Long Day's Journey Into Night . It's proof that Sidney  Lumet's talent is, in every sense, timeless.

 The grim lesson of “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead” is delivered by an elderly jewelry dealer sitting in a tiny, dark room somewhere in the  diamond district of Manhattan. “The world is an evil place,” he declares, with the authority of someone who has seen and done plenty of bad things. “Some people make money from it, and some people are destroyed by it.”  “Devil,” directed by Sidney Lumet from a script by Kelly Masterson, is a chronicle of destruction — physical, spiritual and moral. That most of the victims and most of the perpetrators are members of a single family gives the story some of the suffocating fatalism of an ancient tragedy. But the workings of fate figure far less in the narrative than bad choices and unlucky accidents. The evil in this world arises not out of any grand metaphysical principle, but rather from petty, permanent features of the human character: greed, envy, stupidity, vanity. There are no demons on display, just small, sad, ordinary people. The filmmakers rigorously tally the results of their sins, minor lapses made monstrous by the failure of love and the corruption of ambition. Simple, familiar desires — for money, sex, status, respect — end in murder.  Murder, indeed, is where the story begins, with sex providing a teasing, tawdry prologue. A robbery at a suburban jewelry store shatters the quiet of a Saturday morning with gunfire, breaking glass and the squealing tires of a getaway car. We will witness this crime a few more times, from different points of view, as Mr. Lumet backs up and goes over it again, drawing out its every consequence and implication.  The robbery was planned by Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who enlisted his younger brother, Hank (Ethan Hawke), to carry it out. The dead body on the sidewalk belongs to Bobby Lasorda (Brian F. O’Byrne), a small-time hood Hank recruited for the dirty work. The saleswoman bleeding on the floor is Nanette Hanson (Rosemary Harris), Andy and Hank’s mother and the owner, with their father, Charles (Albert Finney), of the store her sons decided to hold up.  What kind of people would do such a thing? Mr. Lumet, who has been directing movies for 50 of his 83 years, has the wisdom to leave the answer mainly to his actors. Andy and Hank are not explained, dissected or excused. They speak their lines and carry out their actions, and, by the time the film is over, we know them inside and out.  We know that Andy’s marriage to Gina (Marisa Tomei) has hit a snag, that Gina is sleeping with Hank, and that, aside from their affair, Hank’s shrunken life includes a furious ex-wife (Amy Ryan), a young daughter and a collection of nervous tics. He is weak and indecisive —  “a baby” to both Andy and Charles — and probably the last person you would trust to carry out a robbery. If you gave him a quarter to feed the meter, you’d end up with a parking ticket and a stream of pathetic apologies.  But Andy is sure he has everything figured out. A real estate accountant with a high-end drug habit and pathetic fantasies about moving to Brazil, he tends to overestimate his intelligence and underestimate his desperation. He is a cold, shallow, angry man, one of the least likable guys Mr. Hoffman, a specialist in acutely observed male unpleasantness, has ever played. Andy bullies Hank mercilessly, lies to his employers and seems to experience minimal remorse after his perfect crime goes horribly awry. And yet, while never for a moment soliciting our empathy, Mr. Hoffman makes us care about this man, the scale of whose ethical failures gives him a kind of negative grandeur. Besides, his self-hatred makes our disapproval seem a bit redundant.  Mr. Lumet takes what might have been a claustrophobic genre exercise and gives it both moral weight and social insight. His great New York movies of the 1970s and ’80s —  “Serpico,” “Dog Day Afternoon,” “Prince of the City,” “Q & A” — were realist fables, often based on true stories and always full of dense local knowledge. “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead” is relentlessly focused on the terrible events of a few days, but as it zigzags back and forth in time it takes in a larger, longer story, a history of upward mobility and family displacement.  Some time in the past, a tough New York diamond cutter and his wife moved out to Westchester, where they raised three kids (Hank and Andy have a sister) and ran a nice little business. How that modest little dream begat the nightmare of Hank and Andy’s violent fall is an intriguing blank space, a latter-day Theodore Dreiser novel lurking in the shadows of an updated Jim Thompson noir.  Mr. Lumet’s novelistic instincts — and his generosity with actors — are evident in how richly populated the small, involuted world of this movie feels. Secondary and tertiary characters — Gina;  Bobby’s wife, Chris (Aleksa Palladino);   his thuggish brother-in-law, Dex  (Michael Shannon);   that old man in the diamond district — do much more than carry the plot forward. Every scene has a sharp, gamy vitality, even when experienced, from a different angle and with a new significance, for the second or third time.  As pessimistic as it is — you have to squint hard to find the barest flicker of redemption in its denouement —  “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead” is also curiously exhilarating. Some of this comes from the simple thrill of witnessing something, or rather everything, done well. Even the overwrought performances — Mr. Finney’s growls, Mr. Hawke’s twitches — have integrity and conviction. This is a melodrama, after all, and its lifeblood is in the manic acting, just as surely as it is in the plaintive horns of Carter Burwell’s score.  My grandfather, whose background was not so different from Mr. Lumet’s, was dismissive of movies that seemed overly dark or despairing. “There wasn’t a  single decent human being in the whole movie,” he used to complain. He might not have found any in “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead,” but he would also have recognized the humanism that saves this harsh tale from nihilism. The screen may be full of losers, liars, killers and thieves, but behind the camera is a mensch.  “Before the Devil Knows You’re Dead” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The world is an evil place, kids. 

An intricate tragedy that plumbs messy emotional depths with cinematic precision, "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead" explores urban malaise via ingredients so timeless, an ancient Greek stumbling into the theater would recognize the building blocks of mortal folly. Filial impiety, sibling rivalry, marital distress and crippling debt bedevil protags who shop for all their decisions at Bad Choices 'R Us. Satisfyingly draining narrative will probably skew toward older viewers, but the wrenching tale has something for anyone who likes their melodrama spiked with palpable tension and genuine suspense.
Recounted via out-of-sequence episodes with chapter headings, the action deconstructs the four days before -- as well as the week after -- the botched robbery of a mom-and-pop jewelry store. From this comparatively small fulcrum, pic enters a vortex that sucks protags in with irreversible force.
Mining the twin veins of family ties and the American pursuit of the almighty dollar, director Sidney Lumet gives his wisely chosen cast plentiful opportunities to act up a dark, brooding storm. Narrative's escalating tally of sordid maneuvers and desperate acts may seem unlikely to some, but Lumet's "Find Me Guilty" (2006) was in many ways more of a stretch than anything here (and that
 was based on a true story).
In the 1957 debut by Lumet, now 83, only 12 men were "angry" -- here, it's hard to find a character who would recognize serenity if it rang their Westchester or Manhattan doorbell.
Pic starts with chubby but robust Andy Hanson (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the payroll manager for a large New York real estate firm, coupling with gusto with his shapely wife, Gina (Marisa Tomei). Their postcoital chat reveals they're in Rio, and they're both stunned at the quality of sensation they've just shared, since life back in Gotham is apparently unsatisfying in and out of the bedroom.
Onscreen title then switches to "The Day of the Robbery."�Two men drive up to a small jewelry store for what should be a cinch of a heist.�But several things go lethally awry: Shots are fired and the driver screeches off in panic and dismay.
Connections between the characters are doled out with teasing artistry as the ramifications of their actions reverberate. The driver, we learn, is Hank (Ethan Hawke), a likable loser with a shrewish ex-wife (Amy Ryan) and cute daughter. Hank owes three months' child support and holds an undistinguished job compared to his older brother, Andy.
Hank and Gina are having an affair, unbeknownst to Andy, whose own secret life actually outdoes his little brother's. The dynamic between the siblings is rife with unresolved resentment; their parents (Rosemary Harris and Albert Finney) have a loving partnership, but don't seem to have imparted much spontaneity or warmth to Andy, the eldest of their three children.
From wives to ex-wives to girlfriends to secretaries, femmes try to aid or shield the men around them, only to find their efforts pretty much ignored or rebuffed. On the basis of this pic, it's not easy -- or much fun -- to be an American man. Playwright and first-time screenwriter Kelly Masterson incorporates several original twists and sardonic lines (upon being told her late hubby enlisted a pal with a credit card to rent a car for him, his street-smart widow immediately detects a lie, retorting that if he'd wanted a car, he would have stolen one).
The camera probes perfectly designed locations with assertive, communicative lensing. Lumet is unafraid to employ flashy film grammar as events cross-pollinate in sometimes shocking ways. Vet helmer makes human distress as compelling as the most lurid horror pic or special-effects extravaganza, and the film exudes a claustrophobic quality as characters struggle to buy time with dwindling currency.
Lead thesps are outstanding across the board, with excellent support in smaller roles.
Lumet atones for 1992's rocky "A Stranger Among Us" in a few terse scenes with an elderly diamond dealer, to whom key characters come for practical and/or shattering information.
Title comes from the Irish toast: "May you be in heaven half an hour before the devil knows you're dead."

Robustly directed from Kelly Masterson's bear-trap screenplay and lit up with a number of live-wire performances, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead  opens with a happy couple making love like porn starsthe big surprise is that they're married . . . to each other!and a bungled stickup in a suburban jewelry store. Going wrong in a half-dozen crucial ways, the holdup leaves the perp dead, the elderly proprietress dying, and the putative getaway car careening around the mall and out into the Westchester morning. That the sex act has engendered the robbery will only gradually become apparent. When the action flashes back three days to the preparations for the crime, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead  has already established itself as the story of a disaster.
Hank (Ethan Hawke) is a deadbeat dad perpetually behind on his child-support payments and regularly browbeaten by his singularly vindictive ex-wife (Amy Ryan in an effectively soul-crushing one-note performance). Indeed, it seems to be the money that his young daughter needs for a class outing to see The Lion King  that pushes hapless Hank into joining his smooth-talking older brother Andy (Philip Seymour Hoffman) in a scheme to rob their parents' store. To add to the familial intrigue, Hank is carrying on an affair with Andy's restless trophy wife Gina (Marisa Tomei, variously a purring sex machine and a scared bystander, who is hot or cold, sympathetic or selfish as the script requires).
Hawke's need to ingratiate himself as an actor usefully informs his character; he makes an excellent baby brother, a frisky pup and appealing nitwit whose moist smile and frightened eyes are impossible to resist. Hoffman uses his bulk as a form of authority and a bulwark against the world; he's too versatile an actor to be considered playing against type. Andy is a dead-voiced, doughy mass of repressed rage who also has a secret life: He needs money to feed his drug habit and escape an embezzlement charge that's hanging over his head. Smacked out in a luxury shooting gallery, he tells the epicene proprietor: "All my parts don't add up."
Before the Devil Knows You're Dead  pivots on the relationship between these two unlikely brothersthe manipulative elder and weak-willed younger. (Making them siblings rather than friends was Lumet's contribution to the scenario.) Adding to the rivalry is Andy's hatred for his father, Charlie, played by Albert Finney. Sitting with his comatose wife (Rosemary Harris), Dad suggests a fish gasping for breath: This is a movie with a surplus of agonized male grimacing. There are some scenes in which Hawke's face is contorted beyond recognition, and others where he and Hoffman seem on the verge of upchucking from the stress. Indeed, Hoffman has a series of crazed one-on-ones, with Finney and Tomei as well as Hawke, that nearly justify the movie's grueling denouement.
Before the Devil Knows You're Dead  doesn't always compute, but there's little chance to complain. Even as the shuffled chronology adds to the angst, it's the location of murderous violence within a single family that pushes the action toward Greek tragedy. The movie grabs hold and runs you through the wringer. Shot like a bleary morning after, full of powerhouse scenes and over-the-top situations in nondescript locales, it's a pulverizing experience. As a reptilian old 47th Street fence tells the bereaved Charlie, his voice corroded with schadenfreude: "The world is an evil place."
