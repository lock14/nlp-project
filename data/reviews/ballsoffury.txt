It's not even Labor Day, but at least one Oscar race is now over. There's best achievement in costume design -- and then there's Christopher Walken's wardrobe in "Balls of Fury." The devil may wear Prada, but Walken's Feng, a Ping-Pong-obsessed triad kingpin, wears outfits that are three parts Fu Manchu to two parts Tammy Faye Bakker -- and, let it be said, he wears them with Vogue-worthy aplomb. It helps that when Walken's character speaks he sounds like a Jackie Mason who's taken elocution lessons.
In a summer notable for the high degree of intelligence (relatively speaking) demonstrated by dumb-guy comedies -- think "Knocked Up" and "Superbad"-- "Balls of Fury" continues the trend. It's an over-the-top tale of redemption, as a onetime Ping-Pong Olympian finds himself doing battle with Feng. The movie flaunts its ridiculousness and offers a relentless string of jokes about blindness, groin-bashing, and bodily odors (Lady Speed Stick twice serves as a punch line). But it's also amiable, nicely observed, and surprisingly shrewd (both the Lady Speed Stick jokes are killers). "Balls of Fury" also scores points, so to speak, for coming up with its own sports context. "Talladega Nights" had NASCAR. "Blades of Glory" had the world of figure skating. Ping-Pong has . . . rec rooms?
Director Robert Ben Garant, whose first film was last spring's "Reno 911!: Miami," isn't exactly a master of fluid pacing. But thudding is kept to a minimum, thanks to a steady stream of good, if frequently punishing, gags. It's often a case of follow the bouncing bodies as well as the bouncing balls. Garant can thank himself and fellow scriptwriter Thomas Lennon. Their previous collaborations include the "Reno" movie, "Night at the Museum," and "The Pacifier."
Garant can also thank his actors. Walken is Walken, a performer as effortlessly masterful as he is effortlessly strange. George Lopez, as an FBI agent on Walken's trail, maintains a splendid deadpan -- or he does until the final reel, when he can no longer restrain his inner comedian. James Hong, as a blind table-tennis grandmaster, pretty much steals the show. "Ping-Pong isn't the Macarena," he disgustedly tells a pupil. Sun Tzu showing up on "SportsCenter" couldn't sound more authoritative. And Sun Tzu never fell down an elevator shaft.
The grandmaster's pupil is that former table-tennis prodigy, one Randy Daytona. If there were an Oscar category for best achievement in character names, that would be settled now, too. As Daytona, Dan Fogler looks like the illegitimate son Sam Kinison never (?) had. It's hard to say which sticks out farther: Fogler's belly or his frizzy hair. Perpetually wearing a Def Leppard T-shirt, he figuratively bumps into anything within 10 feet of him. Schlubbiness has rarely been so forthright.
Daytona bears the scars of his upset defeat at the Seoul Olympics at the hands of an odiously over-the-top East German -- a kind of Teutonic Apollo Creed -- played by Lennon. As a result of the loss, Feng had Daytona's father killed (don't ask). Nineteen years later, we find Daytona fetched up in Reno -- which threatens to become for Garant and Lennon what Monument Valley was for John Ford -- where he's doing a Ping-Pong lounge act. That's where Lopez's agent shows up, seeking Daytona's help in getting Feng.
Saying much more would spoil the plot, such as it is. Do be warned that if you see "Balls of Fury" you can expect never again to keep a straight face when hearing some athlete declare "I'm going to Disney World!" at the end of the Super Bowl. Oh, and it was Mary Ann Bozek who designed the costume. It would be nice to think, though, that Walken had a hand in the accessorizing.


Balls of Fury  is a joke of a title in search of a movie with a single good joke. It's the kind of comedy that finds Asian people hi-lar -ious because they're...Asian. (Are you laughing yet?) Dan Fogler, as a disgraced American Ping-Pong wizard who is plucked by the FBI to infiltrate an underground table-tennis tournament, is shortish and chunky, with hair-metal curls and sideburns wedgier than Elvis'. A studio head must have barked, ''Get me a Jack Black type!'' The actor Fogler most reminds me of, though, is Curtis Armstrong, that s----eating-grinned junior hustler from Revenge of the Nerds  and Risky Business .
In his Def Leppard T-shirt, Fogler is apprenticed, Karate Kid -style, to a blind Chinese restaurant owner (James Hong) who says things like ''Remember, you suck when you are nervous!'' He then goes off to the Ping-Pong death match presided over by Feng  played by Christopher Walken in outfits that make him look a transvestite geisha, only with his good old spacey-mobster-from-Queens delivery intact. It's meant to be a hoot that Walken showed up and mumbled his lines as if he didn't know the camera was on, but the audience ends up about as bored as he looks.

 The last movie I saw before I went on vacation was “Hot Rod,” about a tall, skinny loser who dreams of rising to glory as a stuntman. The first movie I saw upon my return was “Balls of Fury,” about a short, stubby loser who seeks glory in the world of competitive Ping-Pong. It’s like I never left!  And while I have nothing against either film — aside from the fact that they’re both terrible — I do have one request. Can summer please be over now?  “Balls of Fury” is raunchier and somewhat more imaginative than “Hot Rod,” and it will be must viewing for Christopher Walken completists who have mislaid their special collector’s edition DVD of “The Country Bears.”  Mr. Walken plays a super-villain named Feng, who dresses in red brocade and whose passions are Ping-Pong and having people killed with poison darts shot from a blowgun.  I will forgo plot summary, since it would take me longer to recount the story than it took the screenwriters, Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant, to come up with it. Dan Fogler, looking like the love child of Jack Black and the pornographic-film star Ron Jeremy, plays Randy Daytona, a former Olympic Ping-Pong prodigy who comes out of retirement to avenge his father’s death and help an F.B.I. agent (George Lopez) catch Feng.  Along the way, “Balls of Fury” shambles through a checklist of lowbrow comedy conventions. There’s borderline-offensive ethnic humor (Asians talk funny! They eat strange food and speak a different language!), a few bouts of queasily self-conscious homophobic humor, and of course a gorgeous babe in short shorts (Maggie Q), who falls in love with our nebbishy, hygienically challenged hero.  As usual, the gags and jokes are hit (mainly in the testicles, with Ping-Pong paddles) and miss. Mr. Garant, who directed, does manage to approximate the grungy texture of old Hong Kong action movies, and to execute the Ping-Pong sequences with some panache. But the movie seems to exist mainly so that some critic might say: If you see just one table tennis martial arts parody this year, make it “Balls of Fury.” I’m afraid I can’t go that far.  “Balls of Fury” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has crude humor, profanity and sexual references.

Relentlessly silly in spoofing martial-arts movie conventions, "Balls of Fury" has roughly enough laughs for a first-class trailer but wheezes, gasps and finally goes flat through much of its 90 minutes. "Reno 911!" collaborators Robert Ben Garant (who also directed) and Thomas Lennon (who co-stars) team on the script, but aside from giving pingpong its most loving and extended cinematic exposure since "Forrest Gump," they have served up at best a minor trifle that lacks the inventiveness to keep paddling in theaters for long, with better possibilities of rallying as a DVD.
In some respects, the movie proves most notable for its oddities. In no particular order, these include 78-year-old movie vet James Hong stealing every scene he's in; Christopher Walken's quirky, villainous turn in a gaudy costume that calls to mind Francis Ford Coppola's "Dracula"; "Heroes" star Masi Oka in a blink-and-you-miss-him cameo; and Jason Scott Lee -- who played Bruce Lee in "Dragon" -- in an only slightly less abbreviated appearance, almost unrecognizable under a mop of unruly hair.
As for the plot, it basically careens from one movie send-up to another, after starting with the humiliation at the 1988 Olympics of young Randy Daytona (Dan Fogler, direct from Broadway's "The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee"), dooming him to become a pathetic, pingpong-playing Reno act today.
Shades of "Enter the Dragon," a government agent (George Lopez) approaches Randy to infiltrate a pingpong tournament thrown by the mysterious Feng (Walken), who is clearly up to no good. Ah, but Randy's skills have atrophied, so the movie briefly switches gears to its one modestly inspired segment, a "Karate Kid" riff with Hong as Wong, Randy's ill-tempered blind mentor, and Maggie Q as Wong's niece and Randy's improbable love interest.
After that, it's off to the tournament, with Walken arriving about halfway through -- right around the time all the air seeps out of the movie, fumbling from cliche to cliche without much coherence. Nor does it help that this is clearly a cut-rate production, with the husk of an old Chinese restaurant near Universal Studios conspicuously presented as Feng's elaborate bad-guy lair.
Fogler manages a few zany moments by looking terrified and suffering a number of thudding pratfalls, but with his mangy mane and generous girth, more than anything he seems like a prime candidate to play Sam Kinison should someone make a movie about the comic's life. Other than Hong, in fact, the cast -- with Lennon as Randy's German pingpong nemesis -- is generally squandered, though Lopez does at least get to indulge in a brief "Scarface" homage.
Pic doesn't really serve an ace until its closing credits roll, accompanied by the entire cast's raucous, energetic rendition of Def Leppard's "Pour Some Sugar on Me" that comes as too little, too late. Beyond that, the movie's clever marketing slogan -- "A huge comedy with tiny balls" -- actually has it backward, inasmuch as it takes huge balls to make such grandiose claims about a comedy this tiny.
