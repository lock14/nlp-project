For 45 minutes or so, Kaufman unveils the odd but watchable tale of Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a theater director in Schenectady, N.Y., whose life turns darkly surreal. His wife (Catherine Keener) leaves him, taking their daughter, and he develops a degenerative illness as serious as it is vague (pustules, fading eyesight, premature aging). He's like Woody Allen trapped in a Debbie Downer nightmare. But that's the fun part. In the second half, Caden stages his life as a play, gathering a cast of actors who merge (sort of) with their roles. As they do, Caden adds more and more layers to his theatrical experiment, until he's watching himself watch the actors play characters who are observing themselves. Or something. I gave up making heads or tails of Synecdoche, New York , but I did get one message: The compulsion to stand outside of one's life and observe it to this  degree isn't the mechanism of art  it's the structure of psychosis.

 Correction Appended  To say that Charlie Kaufman’s “Synecdoche, New York” is one of the best films of the year or even one closest to my heart is such a pathetic response to its soaring ambition that I might as well pack it in right now. That at least would be an appropriate response to a film about failure, about the struggle to make your mark in a world filled with people who are more gifted, beautiful, glamorous and desirable than the rest of us —  we who are crippled by narcissistic inadequacy, yes, of course, but also by real horror, by zits, flab and the cancer that we know (we know!) is eating away at us and leaving us no choice but to lie down and die.  Yet since this is a review of a new Charlie Kaufman work, perhaps I should hit rewind: “Synecdoche, New York” is the first film directed by the writer of such unlikely Hollywood entertainments as “Being John Malkovich,” “Adaptation”  and “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” a romance of such delicate feeling that it’s still a shock that it carries a studio brand. Mr. Kaufman’s kinked, playful screenplays are usually accompanied by a flurry of “e” adjectives: eclectic, eccentric, edgy, eggheady. (Also: quirky.) That’s true only if you consider the contemporary American screen, with its talking Chihuahuas and  adult male babies with mother fixations. Come to think of it, the main character in “Synecdoche” has a thing about poop and bosomy women, though happily not at the same time.  To continue, despite my agonizing self-consciousness:  “Synecdoche” is the story of a theater director, Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman, exhaling despair with every breath), miserably married to a talented painter, Adele Lack (Catherine Keener). The two live in Schenectady, N.Y., with their 4-year-old, Olive (Sadie Goldstein), who, when the story opens, is casually evacuating radioactive-green feces. Neither Caden nor Adele is alarmed, so intensely are they wrapped up in a depressive melancholia they seem to have nurtured  longer than their daughter. Even couples therapy (with Hope Davis, in a dazzling brief turn) brings out the worst in them. “Can I say something awful?,” Adele asks (as if she needed permission), before confessing  that she  fantasized  Caden dying. Which made her happy.  Caden lives with Adele and Olive in a “fragile-seeming home,” which is true even if those particular words were written by Arthur Miller, who uses them to describe Willy Loman’s home. As it happens, Caden is directing “Death of a Salesman,” but with a twist: the actors (including Michelle Williams),  are all young. The tragedy of the play, explains Caden, will emerge from the casting: the audience will see the young actors and know that, in time, they will end up every bit as crushed as Willy. In “Salesman,” Miller writes that an air of the dream clings to Willy’s home, “a dream rising out of reality.”  Mr. Kaufman doesn’t directly quote these words, yet they hover over the film nonetheless.  “Salesman” is a smash,  but everything else  falls to smithereens. Adele, who smirks through the play and asks Caden why he’s wasting himself on other people’s work, takes Olive to Berlin for a show that will make  the painter  a star. Caden stays behind, worrying the sores that have sprouted on his body and watching a  pharmaceutical  commercial in which he appears to play a part. Is he delusional? Dreaming? Before you have time to reach for Freud’s “Interpretation of Dreams,” he wins a MacArthur Award, a so-called genius grant, and begins work on a monumental theater production. I want, he tells his therapist with baleful sincerity, to create something “big and true and tough. You know, finally put my real self into something.”  He succeeds in doing the first (the big, the true, the tough); it’s the self part that proves trickier. Among many, many other things, “Synecdoche, New York” is about authenticity, including the search for an authentic self in an inauthentic world. For Caden, creating something that will justify the genius award, which will quiet Adele’s mocking criticism and his own restless doubt, becomes all-consuming. Inside a fantastically,  impossibly enormous warehouse, he begins rehearsing with dozens and then hundreds, thousands, of actors, directing them in separate lifelike vignettes. Ms. Williams’s Claire, the adoring young woman who earlier played Willy Loman’s wife, joins the new cast and soon marries Caden, Adele having abandoned that role. (“I’m famous!” Adele blurts out to Caden on the phone from Berlin before hanging up.)  There’s more — including Samantha Morton as Hazel, Caden’s sweetest of sweethearts — so much more that you would need to recreate the film in its entirety to get it all in, which is precisely Caden’s own tactic. Inside the warehouse, he builds a replica of his world line by line, actor by actor, until fiction and nonfiction blur. Like the full-scale map in Borges’s short story  “On  Exactitude in Science,” the representation takes on the dimensions of reality to the point of replacing it. The French theorist Jean Baudrillard uses Borges’s story as a metaphor for his notion of the simulacrum, which probably explains why Caden, who has trouble naming things, considers titling his production “Simulacrum.” I don’t even know what that means, sighs Hazel.  You may giggle knowingly at that line, but the poignancy of this exchange is that Caden, who is so busy creating one world that he forgets to live in another, doesn’t seem to really understand what it means either. Mr. Kaufman rarely stops to explain himself, but like that simulacrum aside, he continually hints at what he’s up to, where he’s going and why. (Even Caden’s last name is a clue as to what ails him.) Mr. Kaufman is serious about seriousness, but he’s also serious about being funny, so he drops heavy weight (Kafka, Dostoyevsky) lightly, at times comically, and keeps the jokes, wordplay and sight gags coming amid the on- and offstage dramas, divorces, births, calamities, the fear and the sickness and the trembling.  Despite its slippery way with time and space and narrative and  Mr. Kaufman’s controlled grasp of the medium,  “Synecdoche, New York” is as much a cry from the heart as it is an assertion of creative consciousness. It’s extravagantly conceptual but also tethered to the here and now, which is why, for all its flights of fancy, worlds within worlds and agonies upon agonies, it comes down hard for living in the world with real, breathing, embracing bodies pressed against other bodies. To  be here now, alive in the world as it is rather than as we imagine it to be,  seems a terribly simple idea, yet it’s also the only idea worth the fuss, the anxiety of influence  and all the messy rest, a lesson hard won for Caden. Life is a dream, but only for sleepers.  “Synecdoche, New York” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for  grown-up words and female nudity.

Like an anxious artist afraid he may not get another chance, Charlie Kaufman tries to Say It All in his directorial debut, �Synecdoche, New York.� A wildly ambitious and gravely serious contemplation of life, love, art, human decay and death, the film bears Kaufman�s scripting fingerprints in its structural trickery and multiplane storytelling. At its core a study of a theater director whose life goes off the rails into uncharted artistic territory, it�s the sort of work that on its face appears overreaching and isn�t entirely digestible on one viewing. As such, it will intrigue Kaufman�s most loyal fans but put off fair-weather friends on the arthouse circuit, where a venturesome distrib will have its work cut out for it to move the film commercially beyond cult status.
Unusually for a first film, the strangely titled opus feels more like a summation work, such as �8�� or especially �All That Jazz,� as it centers on an artist who battles creeping infirmity and deathly portents by plunging into a grandiose project. On the most superficial level, many viewers will be nauseated by the many explicit manifestations of physical malfunction, bodily fluids, bleeding and deterioration. A larger issue will be the film�s developing spin into realms that can most charitably be described as ambiguous and more derisively as obscurantist and incomprehensible.
At the same time, the picture exerts sufficient power and artistic mystery to pull the willing a fair way down its twisty trail, and a first-rate cast led by Philip Seymour Hoffman and some wonderful women provide a constant lifeline even when it�s hard to know what�s going on. 
For such serious and accomplished artists, Caden Cotard (Hoffman) and Adele Lack (Catherine Keener) live in surprisingly mundane and physically cramped circumstances in upstate Schenectady, N.Y. Caden, who directs a local theater company, and Adele, an adventurous painter, co-exist in a marginal way but seem mentally and emotionally preoccupied, an impression confirmed when Adele tells Caden to stay home while she and their little daughter fly off to Berlin, where she�s having a major gallery opening.
Even before her departure, Caden has begun suffering from a litany of physical maladies as well as the realization that his direction of others� plays doesn�t allow him room for personal expression. At least Adele�s trip would seem to open the door to Caden�s consummation of a strong attraction between him and comely box office worker Hazel (a curly-red-haired Samantha Morton), who, in one early indication of oddities to come, purchases and soon occupies a house that�s burning and full of smoke.
After Caden�s disabilities worsen and things go awry with Hazel, the action explicitly jumps ahead to 2009, when he wins a MacArthur grant and decides to undertake a theatrical venture in which an increasingly massive number of players will act, or re-enact, life as Caden sees it in a freshly constructed replica of Manhattan under the big top of an enormous warehouse.
Yarn�s multiple layers begin manifesting themselves at this stage. It would be folly to pretend that someone watching it all for the first time could enumerate, or even keep track of, every strand of Kaufman�s doubling process, or make entirely coherent sense out of the life-versus-art, life-as-art, or art-instead-of-life postulations that come into play in the second half. Viewers� reactions will depend on how far they�re able to go with the writer-director before either giving up or giving in to his neurotic flights of fancy.
Without revealing too much, it can be said that Caden eventually casts an oddball actor (Tom Noonan), who�s tall and thin rather than squat, to play himself in the evolving epic, and, to play Hazel, chooses an actress (Emily Watson) who�s a near-lookalike. Emotional lines become crossed among these four, with both agreeable and dire results, but a throughline of worry, despair, loneliness and overriding unhappiness is provided by Caden and the fates of those in the tightest orbits around him. Characters age, mutate and transform themselves as Caden tries to play God but is done in at every turn by the simple fact that he�s not cut out for the part.
Despite the general air of unpleasantness and anxiety, and the feeling that the film, like Caden, could explode from overloaded circuits at any moment, Kaufman�s venturesome dramaturgy and compelling writing scene-by-scene are enough to keep one�s curiosity piqued. Significantly crushed by illnesses, the drudgery of life and his failures with women, Caden doesn�t seem like the genius he sees himself as, and the inspiration triggered by the sudden blessing of complete artistic freedom may also be only a figment of his imagination. Whatever the case, Hoffman embodies him completely, forcing the audience to share his every physical and emotional wound.
Along with Keener, who takes off early on, the other actresses shine as the women who both appreciate and tolerate Caden. Morton captivates as the adoring associate the director loves most, and Watson provides an ideal alter ego. Michelle Williams warmly shades the role of the theater company�s leading actress, cast as Caden�s wife in the theater piece; Hope Davis (who could play Hillary Clinton when anyone decides to do that film) sharply etches Caden�s blunt shrink; Jennifer Jason Leigh disappears into a German accent in a very strange role; and Dianne Wiest comes aboard as a late addition to the New York project.
Working with vet lenser Fred Elmes, Kaufman tends to keep his frames tight, provoking a claustrophobic feel that matches Caden�s usual psychological state. Production values come to the fore as the �set� for the ongoing theater project takes shape with evocative verisimilitude, with production designer Mark Friedberg and visual effects supervisor Mark Russell and an extensive effects team earning good marks. The long arcs of Jon Brion�s score go the extra mile to provide emotional continuity to the sometimes quickly changing scenes. 


If you traveled the length of John Malkovich 's medulla oblongata, hung a sharp left at the desk where Beckett's Krapp recorded his last tape, and walked through the adjoining door of the interstellar hotel room at the end of 2001 , you might end up somewhere in the vicinity of Charlie Kaufman 's Synecdoche, New York —a two-hour, loop-de-loop thrill ride so deep into the eternal gloom of its writer and (first-time) director's spotted mind that the Kaufman-scripted Adaptation  seems, by comparison, a sun-drenched landscape epic. Like that film, Synecdoche  is a partly confessional, partly satirical investigation into the creative process—and the notion (or the absurdity thereof) that art can lead to understanding.
Time clearly isn't on the side of regional theater director Caden Cotard (a typically excellent Philip Seymour Hoffman ), the obvious Kaufman surrogate who, in the opening scene, wakes up on the first day of fall only to hear a poetry professor pontificating on the radio about the season's symbolic value as "the beginning of the end." Pay close attention to things like newspaper headlines and the expiration dates on milk cartons and you'll notice that by the time Caden sits down to a chaotic family breakfast with his wife, Adele (Catherine Keener ), and daughter, Olive, nearly two months seem to have elapsed. Indeed, if it's true that, on the calendar of the universe, mankind doesn't show up until sometime around 11 p.m. on December 31, Caden Cotard is a man gripped by the sensation that, any moment now, he will hear the chimes of midnight. Little wonder, then, that he's cast his latest production, a revival of Arthur Miller 's Death of a Salesman , with actors in their twenties and thirties—the tragedy, he tells them, comes from the fact that they too will someday be old.
So deeply self-absorbed is Caden that he scarcely notices his own marriage is fraying at the seams until Adele absconds to Germany with Olive and a chain-smoking lesbian friend (hilariously played by Jennifer Jason Leigh ) to pursue her art career, while Caden finds solace in the arms of his younger leading lady (Michelle Williams ). But the real turning point comes when Caden receives one of the MacArthur Foundation 's $500,000 "genius grants" and rents a cavernous New York City warehouse to stage his magnum opus—a play about "everything," modeled on his own life and the world around him.
There's no script, per se—only scraps of paper handed to actors, scribbled with motivations like "You lost your job today" and "You were raped last night." Eventually, Caden even casts an actor (Tom Noonan ) to play himself directing the play, who in turn (being a director after all) casts yet another actor to play himself. In the name of yet more "brutal truth," the sets are given literal "fourth walls" and, before all is said and done, there's a warehouse inside the warehouse inside . . . well, you get the idea. At one point, it's revealed that Caden's literal living theater has been rehearsing without an audience for nearly two decades. Yet the truth, as is its way, remains just out of reach.
Watching Synecdoche, New York , you get the feeling that you're experiencing Kaufman at 200 proof, with no Spike Jonze  or Michel Gondry  to serve as a sieve for the fulminations of his hyperactive imagination. Given creative carte blanche, he seems to have crammed every idea he's ever had about life, art, and that enigma whose name is Woman into a single, totemic work—his 8  1/2, his All That Jazz . He's willing to try anything, like giving the ditzy box-office girl (Samantha Morton ), who fears "dying in the fire," a house perpetually ablaze with orange flame. That makes for a sometimes unruly affair, but one that's as audacious as anything I've seen on a movie screen this year.
Time is only one of several abiding obsessions here. Hypochondria dominates the early scenes—complete with recurring close-ups on bowel movements—as does an indulgence of homophonous wordplay. Even Kaufman's daunting title is a verbal pun, at once conjuring up the theatrical world that comes to stand in for Caden's reality and the sound-alike Hudson Valley  town where the first part of the movie is set.
In Cannes , where Synecdoche, New York  premiered in May to a chorus of mostly withering reviews, many found these intellectual parlor games tedious to the point of exhaustion and branded Kaufman himself something of a surrealist one-trick pony. That last accusation may be valid, but the trick—and the intensity with which Kaufman's actors devote themselves to it—is nonetheless dazzling. Like most of Kaufman's work as a writer, Synecdoche, New York  is a head trip that time and again returns to a place of real human emotion—in this case, to the idea that no matter how brilliant we may be or think we are, we're all looking for a little guidance (or, yes, direction) in life.
When I interviewed Kaufman several years ago, after the release of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind , he spoke candidly about the fact that he felt he had run dry of ideas and didn't know where he would go from there. That was also around the time that he was said to be writing an original horror screenplay for Jonze, and Synecdoche, New York  is the movie that reportedly materialized out of that process. The result is a horror show all right, albeit one in which the bogeymen are the twin specters of physical and creative death, with Kaufman trying to sort out which of the two is preferable. So it's only fitting that Synecdoche, New York  ends not with a fade to black, but rather to white—the light at the end of the tunnel, perhaps, or that far more terrifying prospect of the blank page and its infinite possibilities.
