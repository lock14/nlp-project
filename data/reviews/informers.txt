Here�s what the makers of The Informers
 never learn about the art of storytelling: Just because your characters are vacuous, less-than-zero types, it doesn�t necessarily mean that the tone and structure of your movie has to adopt the same conditions. You�ll spend at least the first half of The Informers
 trying to get a pulse on the movie�s vast collection of debauched yet anhedonic characters, then most likely throw up your hands (if not your lunch) trying to figure out why you should care about characters who themselves don�t care. It�s not as though they are converging toward any plot or storyline. (Stick around until the end, and you�ll get to verify this movie�s total absence of plot.) Based on Bret Easton Ellis� 1994 collection of linked short stories, The Informers
 (which is co-scripted by Ellis and Nicholas Jarecki) seems to be going for something like Robert Altman�s Short Cuts
, a feature film derived from Raymond Carver�s writings. However, director Jordan (Buffalo Soldiers
) is unable to wrangle any meaning from or raison d��tre for his onscreen sybarites. Perhaps it�s somewhat a matter of timing: Do we any longer need Ellis� clarion portraits of the young and wasted to reveal to us our culture�s moral bankruptcy? The movie is set in 1983 Los Angeles, but apart from the size of the mobile phones and the New Wave music, there is little to distinguish the world portrayed here from the present. The top-line talent, particularly Thornton and Rourke, do manage to hold our attention with idiosyncratic performances, but most of the others are a jumble of fair-haired, disaffected boys. (Heard, however, stands out for her near-total nakedness throughout.) Characters sometimes bleed from one set-piece into the next, but it's often difficult to distinguish one from another. Not a single one offers us a reason to care � and without interesting camerawork or a plot to keep this thing moving forward, The Informers
 sinks back into the muck, like the La Brea Tar Pits in the town it calls home.

'The Informers" takes place in Los Angeles in 1983, and the first question that may come to mind is: Why bother? What new lesson or anti-lesson can be gleaned from the soulless hedonism of the synth-drum decade, especially as it concerns the rich, the beautiful, and those who pretend to love them?
Seriously, so many novels and movies have plumbed the presumed moral vacuum that swirls like toilet water around the city  - from "The Day of the Locust" to "Crash," with Robert Altman's 1993 "Short Cuts" providing the clearest template for this new film  - that goggling at the fauna just isn't enough. The piece had better have something fresh to say. "The Informers" doesn't, nor does it seem to want to.
Gregor Jordan ("Buffalo Soldiers") directs, basing his multi-character drama on a 1994 collection of interlinked short stories by Bret Easton Ellis, who co-wrote the script. If there's a central character here, it's Graham (Jon Foster), young and blond and godlike, although he shows troubling symptoms of genuine affection for his girlfriend Christie (Amber Heard). She's also sleeping with Martin (Austin Nichols), who's also sleeping with Graham's mother, Laura (Kim Basinger), who's not sleeping with her Hollywood power-player husband (Billy Bob Thornton) because he's busy trying to sleep with news anchor Cheryl (Winona Ryder, in a brittle, agitated performance).
Over in the bad section of town lives Graham's doorman Jack, who's played by the late Brad Renfro in his final performance before his death from a heroin overdose in January 2008. Jack is sweaty and wired around the clock, but whether this is acting the film never lets on. Besides, you too might be freaked out if your uncle, played by a grungy Mickey Rourke in his pre-"Wrestler" guttural badness, showed up at the door with a jailbait girlfriend and a kidnapped little boy.
Wait, there's more: A strung-out rock star (Mel Raido) drugs and date-rapes his way through a US tour while his manager (Rhys Ifans) cleans up afterward. A friend of Graham's (Lou Taylor Pucci) goes on an awful Hawaiian vacation with his boozy horndog father (singer Chris Isaak). Actually, that last subplot provides the only scenes that sting in "The Informers," since Isaak dives deep into the part of a man completely unprepared to give up his youth and Pucci conveys mortification so honestly.
The rest is a swankly shot snooze, paced at the tempo of a Depeche Mode ballad that never ends. Jordan evokes "Short Cuts" (a movie which has problems of its own) but to no purpose, since none of the characters rouse themselves from the narcotized stupor of existence enough to make us care. You come away with only the memory of Christie, the film's perfect California blonde, lying insensate on the beach in the final ravages of AIDS  - a potent and frightening image the rest of "The Informers" can't live up to.

 Graham (Jon Foster) and Martin (Austin Nichols) are sitting in a Porsche parked in the hills overlooking Los Angeles. Graham is doing a lot of coke. Martin has been doing Graham’s mom, and also Graham’s girlfriend, Christie (Amber Heard), and also — as he points out just in case we were having trouble identifying the naked blond bodies piling up in various beds — Graham. But such doings are not on Graham’s mind. He is in a moral crisis: “I want someone to tell me what’s good. And I want someone to tell me what’s bad.” He goes on to ask what happens if there’s no one around to tell you what’s good and what’s bad.  One thing that happens is a movie like “The Informers,” of which Graham and Martin are but two of a dozen or so principal inhabitants. They are neither the most messed up nor the least interesting characters to  surface in Gregor Jordan’s puzzling and tedious adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis’s book of short stories. But these two golden boys, like everyone else in this wasteland of privilege and hedonism —  “Los Angeles, 1983,” we’re told, in case we were having trouble placing the palm trees, the asymmetrical top-heavy haircuts and the post-punk soundtrack — are not so much characters as symbols of, well, of some pretty bad stuff.  The corruption of innocence? The death of feeling? The bad vibes of a decade whose emblems (other than the haircuts and the music) are Ronald Reagan and AIDS? Yes, all of that. And some other stuff I probably forgot about. But so did they.  The entitled young in this world favor cocaine, cigarettes and group sex. Their parents prefer alcohol, prescription medicines and adultery. The children regard the parents with icy contempt. Occasionally a flicker of guilt passes over a parental face, but it just may be that the parents are being played by seasoned actors, many with careers going back to the ’80s, and so can sometimes inject a grain or two of nuance into the glazed, dazed, dull surface of the film.  Kim Basinger is in it, playing Graham’s mom. Also Billy Bob Thornton (as her husband, a movie-studio bigwig), Winona Ryder (as his mistress, a television newscaster), Chris Isaak and, alarmingly if also amusingly, Mickey Rourke. Mr. Rourke plays one of the few nonwealthy people in “The Informers.” He drives a van, sports some strange facial hair and kidnaps a child.  Why? For the same reason that a hyperbolically drugged-out rock star (Mel Raido) punches a sweet-faced groupie from Nebraska. To shock us with our inability to feel especially shocked by anything. In Mr. Ellis’s book — not one of his best, but not without interest — the numb plainness of the prose at times achieves a morose clarity, and the deadpan, brain-dead dialogue is tweaked with satire. Nearly every time Mr. Jordan, working from a script by Mr. Ellis and Nicholas Jarecki, tries for similar effects, he goes badly awry, so that you snicker when the movie is trying to be poignant and groan when it aims to make a joke.  From an opening scene that looks, intriguingly enough, like a Billy Idol video shot by  Antonioni, “The  Informers” moves through a few rounds of passionless coupling and passive-aggressive conversation, never provoking a reaction more intense than mild irritation or moderate boredom. The performances run the gamut from twitchy to catatonic, and the stoned stiffness of the actors seems to have less to do with the affectlessness of the characters than with their own confusion.  “The Informers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, sex, drug use and violence. And it’s still boring.

Rating less than zero on the sophistication scale, �The Informers� is thus a totally faithful adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis� novel -- and an accurate look at early �80s-era Los Angeles. Stumbling alongside wasted cases at the top and bottom of the economic ladder -- from Billy Bob Thornton�s near-catatonic studio exec to Mickey Rourke�s lollipop-sucking kidnapper -- the film is banal by obvious intent. The only question, as with other Ellis adaptations including �American Psycho,� is whether auds will appreciate the aggressively shallow depiction of an aggressively shallow milieu, or mistake the pic�s implicit critique for the crime itself. April 10 release will tell.
Dedicated to the late Brad Renfro, who appears briefly as one of many gorgeous young zombies, �The Informers� opens with fast-motion shots of L.A. at night, but otherwise stretches time (and, no doubt, the patience of some) to mirror a warped, woozy morning after in the days when sushi, Spago and MTV were new, cocaine was ubiquitous and Ray-Bans were worn by all. Pic�s subject of rampant superficiality threatens to make it beyond reproach, though the fundamental authenticity of chic boredom here can�t easily be denied.
Standouts in the ensemble cast include Kim Basinger as the executive�s pill-popping wife Laura, who enjoys ogling her shirtless pool boy until he pulls out a rat, and Winona Ryder as Laura�s TV-newscasting rival for the spotty attention of hubby William (Thornton). Lead rich kid Graham is played with aptly ruthless longing by James Spader lookalike Jon Foster. As gravel-voiced bottom-feeder Peter, Rourke is resplendent in a full tan, Hawaiian shirt and porkpie hat, though his relatively minor role doesn�t capitalize on his opponent-pinning perf in �The Wrestler.�
Flaunting its pointed lack of plot from the outset, the film has a pretty boy in a pink blazer being run over and killed by a fellow partygoer in the first reel; then, as if as listless and jaded as its characters, it moves on to fresher meat. 
Another enjoyably inconsequential scene features a British post-punk star swilling vodka in an ice tub, stepping out to light a cig, slipping on the floor and hitting broken glass while a telephone rings incessantly. Director Gregor Jordan (�Buffalo Soldiers�) stages these lurid incidents -- not least a menage-a-trois set to dumb, synth-driven music spilling from a TV -- to emphasize the utterly squandered privilege of the cake-eating participants.
The totally awesome soundtrack includes period hits from Simple Minds, Men Without Hats, A Flock of Seagulls, Devo and Wang Chung -- which, like the film proper, deliver guilty pleasures aplenty while helping to capture the vapid spirit of the times. Tech credits are vividly handsome on all levels. 



Any movie featuring children under 10 is a movie wherein documentary bids to trump fiction and behavior can eclipse acting. The 1934 New Deal flag-waver Stand Up and Cheer! will remain ever fresh for featuring five-year-old Shirley Temple 's precocious (and relatively unedited) hoofing alongside genuinely incredulous veteran vaudevillian James Dunn .
Kid performers naturally introduce elements of magic and mystery into the most banal of situations. They are most resonant, however, when their characters are compelled to fend for themselves—childhood as an existential condition—as in Morris Engel 's The Little Fugitive  (1953), Jafar Panahi 's The White Balloon  (1995), Jacques Doillon 's Ponette  (1996), or, opening this week at Film Forum, So Yong Kim 's Treeless Mountain .
Actually, Treeless Mountain , an American indie made in Korea, doubles the condition by featuring two round-faced, bright-eyed children. Already a latch-key kid with a distracted, prematurely worn mother, six-year-old Jin (Hee-yeon Kim , no relation to the director) is uprooted, along with her younger sister, Bin (Song-hee Kim , unrelated to both), and left in a distant town to stay with a gruffly alcoholic "big aunt," while mom goes in search of the girls' feckless father.
Less mean than selfishly irresponsible (particularly as compared to Jin), Big Aunt complains about her charges, spends their food money on rice wine, sends them out to beg the neighbors for salt, uses a playground scratch to extort cash from other parents, and occasionally goes AWOL. She also neglects to enroll the girls in school—leaving them even more to their own devices. Resentful but resourceful, Jin and her sidekick cadge treats from the nice mommy of a mentally retarded boy living next-door, and then go into business—catching and roasting grasshoppers to sell to other children as snacks.
The girls accumulate coins and carefully deposit them in the piggy bank that is the signifier of their mother's return. She left it with them, explaining that she would be back when it was full. As literal-minded as these two extremely well-behaved children are, they assume that changing their large-denomination coins for a fistful of smaller ones will hasten the happy day. Their magical thinking is perfectly pitched. Like Kim's previous film, In Between Days , about a teenaged Korean girl recently arrived in North America, Treeless Mountain  is at least emotionally autobiographical. (The filmmaker says she was similarly deposited when her mother immigrated to the U.S.)
Predicated on the natural resilience of their pint-size protagonists, kid-perf movies are necessarily affirmative. (As Lillian Gish  says of her little charges in the not-unrelated, but considerably darker, Night of the Hunter : They abide.) Treeless Mountain  is no exception to this rule, although it's also canny enough to resist musical cues or other forms of overt emotional manipulation. Even when the children have been doubly abandoned, dumped by Big Aunt at their maternal grandparents' farm, Treeless Mountain  is skillfully unsentimental—because of, but also despite, the presence of two irresistible, unself-conscious performers in virtually every scene. The children are almost always shot in close-up. The tight focus on the girls gives the film a pleasingly spare quality even as it allows the filmmaker to assemble their performances shot by shot. (As an exercise, it suggests the way that the sound mixers on Guys and Dolls  painstakingly dubbed tone-deaf Marlon Brando 's songs, note by note.)
Taking its title from the barren mound of dirt overlooking the bus stop where the girls last saw their mother, Treeless Mountain  is a careful construction. Indeed, the movie is so closely edited that one is never quite sure how much time has elapsed since the kids were abandoned. But then, that's part of the pathos—neither do they.
The kids are most definitely not all right in The Informers . This lurid trash compacter—directed by Gregor Jordan  from Bret Easton Ellis 's 1994 novel—is set in haute Los Angeles during the early years of the Reagan Era. With its crass, sleek brand of alienation, the movie might have been shot back then as well.
As the novel's two grottiest characters—a vampire and a child-mutilator—have been written out of the script by Ellis and Nicholas Jarecki , The Informers  is mainly a spectacle of privileged, pretty young people (and youthful actors) acting badly. Nights of omnisexual anomie, days of robotic synth-music videos, druggy excess, teenage orgies, and (as this is an '80s allegory) a virulent mystery infection: Are these kids truly depraved or just fucked up? Bad parents? Too much television? A toxic environment? Peering out down the galactic sprawl as his plane comes in for a landing at LAX, a perpetually stoned Billy Idol –type (Mel Raido ) is heard to plaintively mumble, "I used to live here, didn't I?" You know you're in Los AngEllis when a pool boy plucks a dead rat out of the drain.
Playing a tragically married couple of Tinseltown aristos, Billy Bob Thornton  and Kim Basinger  bring a weary measure of taut musculature and grown-up professionalism to the movie. Basinger's erstwhile '80s co-star, Mickey Rourke , is on hand as a dissolute prince of darkness; most lizardly in a leather porkpie hat, an orange tan, and some scraggly D'Artagnan-style facial shrubbery, Rourke elevates the movie's sleaze count even as he deflects his scenes toward narcoleptic comedy. Winona Ryder  provides another odd flashback, in the role of Thornton's newsgal mistress. So does Chris Isaak , his leer polished to a blinding sheen, as the worst of the hideous parentals, having hauled his son off to the beach at Waikiki  for some competitive jailbait cruising.
