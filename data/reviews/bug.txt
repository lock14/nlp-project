The love in "Bug" should not be tried at home. It shouldn't be tried anywhere, really, unless you happen to be one of the trained professionals involved in William Friedkin's engrossingly manic version of Tracy Letts's great stage play. And even then, I'd opt for something less flammable.
It's an oddball romantic drama that descends into comic horror and delivers Ashley Judd at full neurotic tilt (a new angle for her). Lionsgate , which brought us the "Saw" series and "Hostel," is the distributor. Despite the stabbings, amateur dentistry, and worse (yes, worse), "Bug" might throw the average horror fan for a loop with its patient escalation and long conversations. Still it's a surprising, intelligent addition to the studio's sadomasochistic collection.
Judd plays Agnes , a sweaty, coke-snorting woman cooped up in an Oklahoma motel room, where most of the movie is set. Agnes has a problem with her phone. It won't stop ringing. But whoever's at the other end doesn't say anything. She assumes it's her abusive jailbird ex. One drug-fueled evening, Agnes's lesbian friend R.C. (Lynn Collins ) deposits a stranger at Agnes's dingy hovel. He's a tall, wide-faced creature named Peter (Michael Shannon ).
At first, Peter doesn't say a whole lot. He's simply imposing in a way that's sweet and the littlest bit scary. This is, in part, because Peter -- especially when he holds a lamp too close to his face -- looks a lot like young Christopher Walken . It's a resemblance that promises the bizarre. And Peter doesn't disappoint, explaining his uncanny ability to make people nervous: "I pick up things unapparent."
He picks up the sound of a cricket chirping in Agnes's room, for starters. Then he picks up Agnes's willingness to hear it, too.
Were the chirps just her smoke alarm? It barely matters. Suffering a void in her life, she's open to hearing and seeing whatever else he might think he hears and sees. This includes the aphid he swears has bitten him after they make love. Friedkin films the sex like something out of a nature special, with nipples, legs, smalls of the back, and other areas ambiguously arched and spread. In case we've missed the connection, he's redundantly thrown in a scare-shot of an insect at the end of his steamy montage.
That bite in her bed turns into an obsessive search for more bugs, then more bites, both of which Agnes says she sees. Does she see them because they're really there? Does she see them because she's high? Does she see them because she's empathizing with the increasingly unhinged Peter, who basically moves in?
Once she starts peering through his little microscope and hearing his tales of conspiratorial medical-military experimentation, it's too late. Her apartment becomes decorated in nasty flytraps and electric zappers and fogged with bug spray.
If little about Agnes and Peter's perception seems real, their paranoid attraction totally is, and the experience of watching this man burrow deep under this woman's skin (physically and psychologically) is what gives "Bug" its delirious kick. The scratching, the manipulation, the queasy self-mutilation: Not since Michael Haneke's "The Piano Teacher" has the line between besotted and nuts been so hard to glean.
Letts , who adapted "Bug" himself, has what can best be called a sick sense of humor and compelling way with the darker recesses of human nature. His writing here allows the plausible and the absurd to seem so indistinguishable that it doesn't matter which is which.
The movie works as a byproduct of our current climate of suspicious secrecy and wartime post - traumatic stress. But it's probably better appreciated as a work about intense infatuation where desperate feelings are dragged out into the theatrical open. In the last 20 minutes, production designer Franco-Giacomo Carbone even transforms Agnes's motel room into an exaggerated outgrowth of the characters' recreational obsessions. The place is covered in so much foil and colored with such frying neon light that it looks like a bug zapper for freebasers.
Some of Friedkin's attempts to break the movie out its single setting (that sex montage, needless aerial shots of a helicopter's approach toward the motel) are crude. Letts's writing doesn't lend itself to that kind of visual explication: the symbols speak for themselves. Still, it's been over 20 years since the director's filmmaking has been this convincing. Like "The Exorcist ," which Friedkin made in 1973 at the top of his commercial powers, "Bug" is another viscerally draining tale of possession.
And directing the possessed, Friedkin is in his element. This cast is small, and it's very good, including Harry Connick Jr. as Agnes's greasy husband and Brian F. O'Byrne , who briefly adds further mystery to the proceedings.
Shannon and Judd luxuriate in codependent frenzy. He had a small but memorable part as a scarily patriotic marine in "World Trade Center ," and originated the role of Peter on the New York stage. He finds a core of sadness within Peter's mania, making the character just vulnerable enough for us to get why Agnes would want to abet his madness.
Meanwhile, Judd does wounded, needy, frazzled, grimy, and stupid with a crackle her acting has lacked. For once, it's her emotional nakedness that's exciting. Having bared so much of her body, she finally seems eager to bare some of her soul.
She and Shannon seem to know they're playing something simultaneously ridiculous and emotionally for-real. "Bug" is funny and 
thrilling. The comedy and horror are boiled together, and the fatalistic result might be tragedy, sure. But it's a gonzo kind you can laugh at.


         One of those shifty words that happens to describe a range of unrelated yet somehow mysteriously connected ideas, "bug" — which can of course refer to a variety of insects as well as function as a synonym for things such as "to bother," "to put under surveillance" and "to totally freak out" — seems to span the range of delusional paranoid concerns like somebody planned it.
 
 William Friedkin's "Bug" is an adaptation of Tracy Letts' play about a pair of lonely losers who hole up in an Oklahoma motel room together to crack up and fall apart.  The play had successful runs in Chicago, New York and London, and coincidentally (or maybe not) is also running at the Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood through June 3. The film version, starring Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon (he also appeared in the original productions), is creepy and unsettling, to say nothing of gory, but overall it's a little claustrophobic and uneven.
 
 


         






   FOR THE RECORD:

  'Bug': In some copies of today's Calendar section, the review of the movie "Bug" gave June 3 as the date for the closing of the play that the film is based on. The production at the Coast Playhouse in West Hollywood has been extended to July 8. —
 

 
 The movie opens with an aerial shot of the motel, a middle-of-nowhere dump we've come to recognize as the kind of place where no good can come to anyone. And I'm not talking about bad cable reception or a broken ice machine. Something about the washed-out, yellowy beige landscape and the nervously undulating light suggests imminent bloodshed, and on this front "Bug" delivers, if in relatively small doses.
 
 It takes some time to settle into the notion that Agnes, or Aggie (Judd), actually lives in the place, so unsettled is her demeanor and so impersonal her personal space. Aggie's nervousness, we learn, is due to the recent release of her felonious ex-husband, Jerry (Harry Connick Jr.), who may be the person taunting her with all the silent phone calls she's been receiving. As for her interior design sense, though, it's suggested she's lived here for a while and she has apparently never unpacked more than a bottle of booze and a cigarette.
 
 It only takes looking at Aggie to know that she's in for it, and the impression is confirmed when her best friend, R.C. (Lynn Collins), who is a lesbian, comes over with a guy for Aggie and some drugs for the three of them one night.
 
  Shifty and quiet, tense and vulnerable, Peter looks and acts like the kind of guy horror movies were built on. Among the first things he says to our heroine is: "I'm not an ax murderer." Among the second: "I make people nervous anyway."
 
 He's not kidding.
 
 Peter, it turns out, has a complicated psychological past further complicated by the U.S. Army, from which he's gone AWOL. Opening up to Aggie about his past and his fears, he sounds — not that we're trained experts — like your basic delusional schizophrenic. Then again, it might just be impossible not 
to sound like a delusional schizophrenic when describing certain top-secret Army protocols. I wouldn't know.
 
  To complicate matters further, Peter isn't exactly the type to just say no, either — though the drugs that show up near the beginning of the film don't make another appearance until near the end.
 
 Not having seen the theatrical production, it's not possible for me to say how much better this concept worked onstage, but my guess is that "Bug" may be fundamentally better suited to the other medium. The problem is not the single-room set or the nonspecific depressive naturalist look of the production, or even the occasionally abstracted, cadenced language — though none of these choices really quite supports what turns out to be a metaphysical freak-out inspired by a play on words.
 
 The main problem for me was the fallback naturalism of the style, which made what must read on stage as ambiguity read on film as inconsistency. Aggie's point of view — which, after all, as she hungrily adopts her new boyfriend's madness in order to stave off any more loneliness, is our entry into a purely imagined world — is kept at a distance. Close-ups of Peter's mysterious bloodsucking aphids — whether they exist or no — are notably missing. It's one thing to take Aggie's word for it that she does, in fact, see the bugs Peter so fervently believes in while she's yards away on a stage; it's another to do so when the camera could so easily give her eyeball-an-inch-away-from-his-finger- eye-view but chooses not to.
 
 It comes as a surprise, as the movie advances, to realize that what we're watching, gruesome as it becomes, is also a parody, and a very funny one at that. The shift in tone — reflected in the ever more panicky language, the anti-insect redecoration of the room and the gruesomeness of the violence — takes us from what begins as a grim, familiar drama into something much weirder. By the end, you wonder if you're not hallucinating too.
 
 There's a clever and interesting conceit somewhere in here, and the creepiness of it gets under your skin. But "Bug's"  relentless unpleasantness, which Friedkin bogs us down in instead of crystallizing it into what might have been a stylish head trip, can get to be a chore.
 
 
 "Bug." MPAA rating: R for some strong violence, sexuality, nudity, language and drug use. Running time: 1 hour, 42 minutes. In general release.   

Here's one creepy love story: Agnes (Ashley Judd), a hard-up woman, meets Peter (Michael Shannon), a weirdo man. The two hole up in Agnes' shabby motel-room home on the edge of desert-nowhere Palookaville, where, when not doing waitress duty at a lesbian bar, she spends her time fearing her recently paroled ex-husband, Jerry (Harry Connick Jr.). And somewhere between sex and a dark night of the soul, Peter passes his paranoid convictions  about government surveillance, secret mind-control experiments, and the invisible insects he says are burrowing into his skin  along to Agnes, who desperately needs something in which to believe. Whatever has bitten Peter, causing him to claw at his own skin, spreads to the woman beside him, too. In time their motel haven becomes one twisted bug hole, which they seal off against the light of day. Woe, let's just say, to anyone who shows up at the door.
Bug , written by Tracy Letts, was originally an intimate, unsettling play in which the confines of the stage could reflect the emotional and psychological claustrophobia of the subject matter. Letts adapted his own script, but the movie is now also inflected with the stylistic details of director William Friedkin, who clearly took on the project with the aesthetic affinity of one who made the creepy and claustrophobic memorably manifest in The Exorcist . Here, the filmmaker has to expand the contours of the play's static physical dimensions  a challenge that Friedkin meets with about as much success as possible for an edgy drama so essentially...playlike. The enjoyably icky heart of Bug  is still contained within the airless, increasingly ''bug-proofed'' room that becomes Agnes and Peter's whole world. But the director also emphasizes the camera's ability to heighten our sense of dislocation, first by opening with a larger, lonelier desert landscape, and then by prowling restlessly around the tormented protagonists in what amounts to the visual equivalent of what an itch feels like.
Shannon, a compelling stage actor with a mean-baby face that morphs by imperceptible degrees from innocent to madman, originated the role on the stage. And it's difficult to imagine anyone else playing the part, so authoritative is his access to every twitch of Peter's growing mania. But that doesn't mean another filmmaker might not have jettisoned him for a more famous screen presence, and it's to Bug 's benefit that Shannon is given free rein to set the pace of the drama's queasy tension.
Then again, as screen-friendly casting goes, Judd is an exciting match; it's rewarding to see her find not only what's tough (she's always good at that) but also what's bruised, soft, and responsive in such a mutable character. Her face stripped bare, Judd is capable of great, bone-weary stillness, and her depiction of unraveling, in symbiotic identification with the new, dangerous man in Agnes' life, is an unexpected pleasure.

 There was a time when Ashley Judd seemed poised to take on if not great roles, then at least interesting ones. Her 1993 breakthrough in the delicate drama "Ruby in Paradise" suggested that she could go far in films that called for vulnerable young women with steely underpinnings. Instead she strayed into mediocre thrillers ("Kiss the Girls,"  "High Crimes")  that not even Morgan Freeman's dignified presence could salvage.  In "Bug," an overwrought psychodrama directed by William Friedkin, Ms. Judd's acting continues to surpass her career choices. Playing a vaguely unstable barmaid living in a seedy Oklahoma motel, she convincingly juggles an abusive husband (a bulked-up Harry Connick Jr.) and a newfound lover (Michael Shannon), who sees creepy-crawlies in the mattress and conspiracies everywhere.  Adapted by Tracy Letts from his 2004 play, "Bug" builds momentum from Michael Grady's agitated camera movements and Ms. Judd's increasingly distressed face. Mr. Friedkin has always been more fascinated by the evil inside our heads than the boogeyman outside, and he knows how to turn small spaces — like the bedroom in "The Exorcist" — into horrific theaters of war.  The escalating hysteria and grisly set pieces of "Bug" may strain credulity, but Ms. Judd has never been more believable as a woman condemned to attract the wrong kind of man.  "Bug" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Its characters lose clothes, teeth and eventually their minds.
The commitment of the actors runs in inverse ratio to the connection audiences will feel to "Bug." A ranting, claustrophobic drama that trades in shopworn paranoid notions, William Friedkin's overwrought screen version of Tracy Letts' play assaults the viewer with aggressive thesping and over-the-top notions of shocking incident, all to intensely alienating effect. With the action largely confined to one grungy motel room, unshakeable stage bound feel merely adds to the overall lack of appeal, leaving Lionsgate with an uncommercial pic that could only pull quick coin via a cynically misleading campaign emphasizing violence, gore and weirdness.
Adapted by Letts from his 2004 Off Broadway success, tale deals with marginal characters who, at the outset, are struggling just to make it day-to-day in a scrubby Western wasteland. Teetering on the edge of equilibrium, Agnes (Ashley Judd) lives in a grungy desert motel, tends bar at a raunchy watering hole with lesbian pal R.C. (Lynn Collins) and remains tormented by the long-ago disappearance of her young son.
Agnes' questionable stability is rocked by the abrupt return of her threatening ex Jerry (a gloweringly hunky Harry Connick Jr.), back from two years in the pen, but a young man who turns up with R.C. one day introduces an intriguing new element to her baleful life. Strange, subdued and insightful, Peter (Michael Shannon) just hangs around, with uncertain intent; admitting that "I'm not good for much" and claiming he has no interest in sex, Peter nevertheless has an aura about him, one initially enhanced by Shannon's offbeat performance.
The actor, who played the role onstage in New York and London, single-handedly sets a fresh rhythm for the piece with his unusual cadences and pregnant pauses, and his unfamiliarity as a screen presence heightens interest for a while.
But soon Peter is talking about a "bug" he contracted as a soldier in the Middle East, one he may have been deliberately given, and the drama quickly degenerates into a series of screaming matches devoted to lathered up paranoid delusions and emotional complicity between desperate souls at the end of their tether.
Peter, whose body gradually becomes covered with gruesome scratches and marks, insists that he has little bugs under his skin, and he soon has Agnes believing she does too; their motel room shortly comes to resemble an art installation covered in tin foil and festooned with insect-catching sticky strips.
The spectre of an insidious government (personified by Brian F. O'Byrne's medic) closing in on the wayward Peter eventually takes over both the story and the former soldier's mind, with results that send the actors into paroxysms of hysteria and causes the tin foil to be adorned with generous swatches of blood.
The driving obsessions with an evil military establishment, its secret medical experiments and the complicity of damaged souls are so old that they may have seemed new to the Off Broadway auds that made the show a hit. Friedkin pours endless energy into keeping the staging and camerawork vibrant, but the more he and the thesps press home the emotional urgency of the text, the more one is compelled to reject it, especially when some grotesquely gory incidents are introduced in the name of violent intensity.
The actors' devotion to their work here is manifest, even as it goes unrewarded due to the grandstanding level to which the performances uniformly pushed. Small-scale, close-ups-dominated pic looks sharp.

The most volatile, least easily psychoanalyzed of '70s auteurs in Peter Biskind 's classic New Hollywood  tell-all Easy Riders, Raging Bulls , William Friedkin  may have mellowed since unleashing The Exorcist , sliding into box-office hell, and marrying a major studio boss. Indeed, the recovering bad-boy movie bratnow 71, believe it or nothas directed more operas than motion pictures in the past decade. But his new Bug , made on the cheap for the horror-loving kids at Lionsgate , is genuinely freaky-deaky, not to mention more inventively unsettling than anything Friedkin has mustered in the quarter- century since twisting little Linda Blair  into a satanic spewer of pea soup and F-bombs.
Seems an old dog can learn new tricks after all. Based on Tracy Letts 's Off- Broadway hit from a few years back, Friedkin's most modestly produced feature since 1970 mostly confines its creepy-crawly head games to one dingy motel room, where an Oklahoma honky-tonk barmaid (Ashley Judd ) holes up with a wigged-out stranger (Michael Shannon ) just back from major combat operations in the Middle East. To varying degrees, these two damaged, desperate souls let their imaginations run wild in tight quarters, leading to full-on madness and an erotic/violent climax right out of Almodóvar's Matador . For now, let's just say the vet has got something under his skinan itch he can't sufficiently scratch. As for Judd's jittery Agnes, who collects coins in a glass jar and opens a wine bottle with her teeth, she has been having a rough time ever since her toddler son went missing; in recent years, she has also struggled to keep a distance from the inmate ex-husband (Harry Connick Jr.)  who battered her. At the start of the movie, Agnes gets crank phone calls that suggest the convict has been sprung. Message: The war at home is a killer, too.
Not to say that Friedkin, whose demonic-possession flick threatened to exorcise the unholy women's-lib movement in '73, has finally gotten political. Flamboyantly absurd, Bug  often plays like a satire of the lefty paranoia cinema that was big in Friedkin's Hollywood heyday. And yet its psychological insights into mental illness remain acute, even sensitive; if nothing else, the newly penny-pinching director doesn't disparage the veteran head case whose bugged-out condition lends such post-traumatic ingenuity to the bare-bones production. Halfway through, when the cheap-motel mise-en-scéne begins to feel familiar, our resident weirdoconvinced that a nefarious Army experiment has left him with tiny "rogue aphids" in his bloodstreamproceeds to wrap the entire room in tinfoil. Presto a new movie set at Reynolds Wrap  prices!
Friedkin's other affordable manipulations are unnervingly effective as well. In tight close-ups, he favors flicking the zoom lens forward just a smidgen to enhance the flop-sweat feel of an already clammy, claustrophobic film. More than Vacancy , the season's other room-for-rent thriller, Bug  has an aesthetic bead on the cut-rate menace of motel hell: The sounds of clanging old phones, buzzing fluorescent lights, and an ill smoke alarm are amped to aptly torturous levels. But beyond the movie's minor effects, including snippets of cattle prod shock-style cutting, ostensibly there to goose the first hour for Saw  fans, Bug  is principally a showcase for actors, rarely more than two on-screen at a time. Connick's testy scenes with Shannon are precise studies in she's-mine macho posturing, allowing Friedkin to imply that, for the heroine, the abusive ex-con isn't the only man she may need to fear. As for Judd, her persistent interest in working-class- female neurosis continues to be about more than trading the makeup kit for a shot at Oscar gold. Needing a man, any man, even a self-mutilating lunatic ("Guess I'd rather talk with you about bugs than nuthin' with nobody"), her Agnes undergoes an extreme, insect-like metamorphosis, turning Bug  itself from a horror movie into something like a love story.
Love? How will such mushy stuff fly with Lionsgate's core gore audience? Well, at a mere $4 mil, seemingly recoup- able on DVD alone, Bug  makes what the kids think appear rather irrelevant which in turn makes the film  look like a rare triumph for the old New Hollywood. Friedkin's fellow '70s playersCoppola, De Palma, Scorsese, Spielbergwouldn't dare work at this neo-grindhouse level, and it's a damn shame. Only with nothing left to lose will a heartbroken survivor like Agnes, like Friedkinbe willing to get down and dirty.
