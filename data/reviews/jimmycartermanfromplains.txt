Forget the homespun title. As we follow the former president through the media glare of his book tour for Palestine Peace Not Apartheid , director Jonathan Demme creates a gripping meditation on the very hot-button-ness of the Israeli-Palestinian question. Was Carter wrong to analogize Israeli policy with that of white South Africa? That's Jimmy Carter Man From Plains ' obsessive issue, and it's galvanizing to see it played out through the furious contradiction of Carter's personality. He is pious, stubborn, compassionate, testy, moral, unreasonable, and wise.

 Jimmy Carter isn’t a real saint, but he plays one in a new documentary. That film, “Jimmy Carter Man From Plains,”  was directed by Jonathan Demme and is a friendly, at times fawning, at times gaga 126-minute chronicle of the former president’s 2006 national book tour to promote and occasionally defend his best seller “Palestine Peace Not Apartheid.” Much like its subject, the film is approachable and tonally unmodulated. It delivers even its loudest, most contentious points in a quiet, measured, indoor voice.  Mr. Demme has said that he liked Mr. Carter as a president and has “admired what he has accomplished since.” That much seems clear from “Man From Plains,” which opens with archival images of Lillian Carter on “The Tonight Show” telling Johnny Carson (resplendent in an eye-popping plaid suit) that Jimmy, her eldest child, never criticizes her. From this affirmation — of the mother’s love, of the son’s magnanimity — the film cuts to what will become one of its more recurrent images of Mr. Carter,  of him seated in a car or a plane, and talking to the camera, or into a cellphone, or to an assistant, or to a Secret Service agent as the world races and sometimes drifts by him through the adjacent window.  When Mr. Carter isn’t talking in a car or a plane, he’s discoursing on television and radio. Mr. Demme never obviously joins in the conversation, though he communicates through each image, camera angle and edit. His choices speak volumes about what he would like us to know about Mr. Carter: the former president flies commercial, handles his own luggage (he even waves off the help of one hotel doorman) and reads the Bible daily with his wife, Rosalynn. He helps build houses for Habitat for Humanity and hugs children. He loves Israel. But he wants it  to stop oppressing the Palestinian people because it’s the right thing to do and because it will lead to peace in the Mideast. It’s that simple.  This sense of simplicity is underscored by Mr. Carter’s folksy manner and by Mr. Demme’s representation of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a tidy loop with images of Israelis bulldozing Palestinian homes followed by images of dead Israelis after a suicide bombing. I couldn’t help but wonder what the leftist intellectual Ellen Willis would have made of Mr. Carter’s interest in Israel. In a 2003  essay, “Is There Still a Jewish Question? Why I’m an Anti-Anti-Zionist,”  Ms. Willis wrote that “the left has focused on Israeli acts of domination and human rights violations with an intense and consistent outrage that it fails to direct toward comparable or worse abuses elsewhere, certainly toward the unvarnished tyrannies in the Middle East (where, for instance, is the divestment campaign against Saudi Arabia?).”  The former  president’s evangelical Christianity  makes his focus on the Holy Land all the more intriguing. Yet, while Mr. Carter invokes Jesus almost as much as he does Israel in the documentary, Mr. Demme never directly puts these two parts of  his subject’s life into play with each other. Neither does the filmmaker engage with any of the more inflammatory claims from Mr. Carter’s book, including this:  “There are constant and vehement political and media debates in Israel concerning its policies in the West Bank, but because of powerful political, economic and religious forces in the United States, Israeli government decisions are rarely questioned or condemned, voices from Jerusalem dominate in our media, and most American citizens are unaware of circumstances in the occupied territories.”  “Man From Plains” isn’t about engagement; it’s about disengagement from Mr. Carter’s critics and his more provocative beliefs. It’s also about legacy building. Mr. Demme adds to that legacy fluidly, with an exception. At one point the camera leaves Mr. Carter’s side to duck into a  Yemeni-Israeli restaurant in New York to watch customers watching him defend his book on “Larry King Live.” And what do we learn from these random diners, who — for all we’re told, could be Jews or Baptists — other than that they apparently like Yemeni food? Well, according to one of the two men briefly interviewed, the solution is to put a gun to the head of the Hamas leadership, a comment whose inclusion says more about this over-simplistic documentary than it does about this ostensibly representative Jewish voice.  “Jimmy Carter Man From Plains” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There are some images of violence, including bloodied bodies.

It's easy to underestimate the careful construction behind Jonathan Demme's peerless portrait of Jimmy Carter, as the former president occupies the frame so totally and unself-consciously. Starting and ending in his Georgia hometown, "Man From Plains" follows Carter's tour for the most controversial of his 21 books, 2006's "Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid." Thanked and vilified from coast to coast, Carter remains steadfast in his belief that Israel's policies in the Occupied Territories are unjust and counterproductive. As complex as its subject, Sony Classics docu may ride the Middle East conflict into theaters, but the 39th president will keep it there. 
Carter's profound religiosity, which seemed intrusive and hokey at the time, now appears a template of tolerance. Seen hammering nails into a house under construction by Habitat for Humanity in New Orleans, and, using Demme's docu to complain to a larger audience about the shameful conditions that persist there, Carter gives new credence to his long-held belief in the solvability of poverty and homelessness.
To many, the Cassandra-like Carter makes more sense in hindsight than when he lived in the White House. In a televised clip from the '70s, Carter speaks about the necessity of developing alternate fuels to avoid being oil-dependent -- logic that seems totally self-evident today.
But his search for world peace -- and, highest on his list, peace for Israel -- has so far escaped such retrospective clarity. Carter admits he deliberately chose the word "apartheid" for the title of his book to spark discussion, although he also contends the situation in Gaza and the West Bank does indeed conform to the definition of that word.
But, the term set off a firestorm of protest among Jewish leaders and Israel supporters. While Carter has often been attacked, he had never before been branded as a liar, bigot and anti-Semite, and "it hurts," as he admits to a receptive audience at Brandeis U.
The transparency Carter displayed as president, his inability and/or unwillingness to hide the truth as he saw it, may well have led the nation to elect a consummate, feel-good actor to replace him. Or so the theory goes. But Carter's candor also ensures that little or none of what Demme records exists solely for the camera.
Docu verifies this lack of distinction between Carter's private and public personae. That includes Carter shaking everyone's hands on every commercial flight he takes. At the same time, whether he's hanging out with media lefties like Al Franken or tame talkshow hosts like Jay Leno, he is basically alone on the other side of the mic.
Demme taps Rosalynn Carter to describe the long, up-and-down progress of the still-standing Camp David peace accord of 1976 between Israel and Egypt from her own point of view, though she was not in the same room and sometimes not even the same compound as President Carter, Israel's Menachem Begin and Egypt's Anwar Al Sadat. The story that emerges, illustrated with footage from the time, delivers a surprising lesson in the importance of small details and the ultimate power of negotiation.
At rest, Carter appears stooped and fragile, every minute of his 82 years. But once in motion, once involved, he seems reborn. Indeed, when Demme twice shows him swimming, one still sees the indomitable will and total engagement driving the frail body. Taking care of his farm, teaching Sunday school, riding his bike with his wife around Plains and overseeing elections in far-flung parts of the globe are, amazingly, all in a day's work.
Tech credits are excellent.

Jonathan Demme , who directed Tom Hanks  to an Oscar as the AIDS-afflicted lawyer in Philadelphia , may be the most well-meaning filmmaker in Hollywood ; Jimmy Carter , winner of the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize  "for his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development," is certainly the most well-meaning ex-President in recent American history. And so Demme's documentary portrait, Jimmy Carter: Man From Plains,  has no surfeit of good intentions. In fact, running over two hours, they're nearly suffocating.
Basically a vérité-style infomercial that follows Carter during the course of a late 2006 book tour to promote his bestselling critique of Israel 's West Bank  occupation, Palestine : Peace Not Apartheid , the film provides perfunctory background on its subject's piety and down-home Georgia roots, then plunges along with him into the media maelstrom. Carter stubbornly fences with Charlie Rose , gamely educates Larry King , and cheerfully signs a vast quantity of books. It's striking to see the number of grateful Palestinian-Americans who turn out to thank him, and it's notable that people still ask about his handling of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis.
Carter is scarcely the first commentator to characterize the enforced, unequal separation that exists in Israel's occupied territories as apartheidthe Israeli left has called it that for years. But, waving the term like a red cape before the American public, Carter has been notably disingenuous in exploiting it. Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid  actually gives the implied analogy between Israel and white supremacist South Africa  short shrift, as does the film. The conditions of the occupation are largely unexplored. Demme does, however, give sound bites to Carter's critics, notably Allan Dershowitzwho cannot resist noting that he supported Carter for president. (There's something about the place that Carter calls the Holy Land that brings out the Holier Than Thou.) A montage of Israeli bulldozers and Palestinian suicide bombers triggers a flashback to Carter's shining moment at the 1978 Camp David  negotiations, one of America's few diplomatic triumphs in the Middle East and the ultimate example of Carter's do-goodism.
A detour to some habitat-building in New Orleans aside, Jimmy Carter  never strays far from the controversy. (Carter defends his book's inflammatory title by calling the West Bank worse than South Africaciting, for example, the existence of highways constructed exclusively for settler use; Jews picket a book signing in Phoenix.) But neither does the movie delve into the situation. Carter's personality, not Palestine's predicament, is Demme's focus. A benign presence, Carter flies coach, mingling easily with his fellow passengers. At once soft and steely, reasonable and unyielding, he sits for interviews with both Israeli TV and Al Jazeera . (The latter is notable for the evident surprise expressed by correspondent Riz Khan when Carter blames Palestinians as well as Israelis.) At least as much time, however, is given to a scene in which Carter banters with the make-up artist who is applying his pre-TV pancake.
In the end, managing finally to deliver a lecture at Brandeis  without having to debate Dershowitz as a condition, the 82-year-old former president is evidently weary. He resents that he's been called a liar, a bigot, an anti-Semite, and a plagiaristas well he might. He's just doing what he can. So too Demme, who tries to heighten the drama with strategic infusions of faux-Arab and faux-gospel mood music. But a book tour isn't even a political campaign, and traveling with Jimmy Carter isn't exactly going backstage with the Rolling Stones . It's a measure of Demme's quiet desperation that he would cite, as one of the movie's "excitements," the opportunity to see NPR radio  interviewer Terry Gross  in the flesh.
