In "Illegal Tender," a boy's best small arms supplier is his mother. She's got your back in a shoot-out, too.
The movie's a genuine oddity: a Latino action drama with one foot in bullet-spitting genre flicks -- '70s blaxploitation and '80s coke-kingpin films are the primary reference points -- and the other in raggedly personal family melodrama. Produced by John Singleton, it's the handcrafted work of writer/director Franc. Reyes, whose previous movie "Empire" (2002) gave Isabella Rossellini a lulu of a role as a Colombian drug dealer.
The female roles in Reyes's movies start small and eventually go operatic. In "Illegal Tender," it's Wanda De Jesus' turn to play the hard-boiled diva as Millie DeLeon, a wealthy suburban widow with a skeleton or two in her closet. Her rebellious college-age son, Wilson (Rick Gonzalez), doesn't understand why he and his little half-brother (Antonio Ortiz) have to move every few years, and now that Wilson has a girlfriend, Ana (Dania Ramirez), he's even more inclined to stick around.
Why, mama, why? Since we already saw Wilson's drug-dealer dad (Manny Perez) get gunned down by mob boss Javier (Gary Perez) in a 1985 prologue, we have an inkling, but "Illegal Tender" has a few surprises up its sleeve. The ones you expect least are generally the most entertaining, like all those businesslike hit-ladies in hot pants. Or the importance of buying Microsoft
 stock in the mid-'80s.
Normally this sort of low-end revenge thriller plays out with drab predictability. "Tender" keeps disarming you with funk, though. The dialogue is fumbling but at least it's not boilerplate. Ganglingly intense lead actor Gonzalez is no one's idea of a movie star, and that's why we keep watching him. When Wilson finds himself holding off Javier's assassins at gunpoint, his hands believably shake. (Girlfriend, meanwhile, is freaking out under the basement stairs with a kitchen knife.)
For her part, De Jesus gains in stature until by the final scenes she's a snarling wonder to behold: a double-pistol-packin' mama who accompanies her boy to Puerto Rico for a climactic confrontation with Javier. A few more surprises: One of the villain's bodyguards is played by the eccentrically charming reggaeton star Tego Calderon, and Javier turns out to be something of a softie, although a lethal one.
"Illegal Tender" turns out to be a modest surprise, too -- a solid meat-and-potatoes B-movie with enough personality to spin it in unexpected directions. That personality is Reyes's, and whether he goes north or south from here, he's some kind of filmmaker to watch.


There's a moment, early on in Illegal Tender , when Wilson (Rick Gonzalez), an entitled college whiz, follows his widowed mother (Wanda De Jesus) into the basement of their lush Connecticut manse, where she opens a safe and unloads a cache of guns. This is her secret: that they've been on the run for 20 years because of something his late father, a ''noble'' drug dealer, did. For a second, the movie has the snap of a truly surprising thriller  like a Hispanic Kill Bill   about an aging lioness willing to kill to protect her cub. But then we go back to following the kid, who manages to both mope and strut along the path to manhood.

 Luridly earnest and laughably immoral, “Illegal Tender” is an old genre movie with a new look. Call it Hispanixploitation.  Placing all its faith in the formidable Wanda de Jesús as Millie, a pistol-packing mama whose violent past is nipping at her heels, the movie gives her a lavish Connecticut lifestyle (financed by her late husband’s drug money) and two oblivious sons. But when gangsters from the old neighborhood come calling, it’s up to the elder boy (Rick Gonzalez) to  protect the family unit.  This will require a trip to Puerto Rico, which is also an opportunity to pad the plot with jiggling behinds and strobe-lit bosoms. (Like most fictional drug lords, the villain here does all his business in a crowded nightclub.) But though Mr. Gonzalez does his best to appear threatening, his callow confrontations with the cream of Puerto Rico’s underworld are no more convincing than his mother’s twisted family values.  Written and directed by Franc. Reyes, “Illegal Tender” features telenovela dialogue (“He’s not bad news, Wilson, he’s the worst news there is”) and a surprisingly racist insinuation. “Dig deep enough into people’s lives and you’re gonna find stains,” says Millie at one point,  implying that all successful minorities prospered by dubious means. Not exactly a suggestion one expects from a John Singleton production.  “Illegal Tender” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has men in shades, women in heat and guns in closets.

Mother knows best -- and shoots straight -- in "Illegal Tender," a Latin-flavored crime meller propelled by a throbbing soundtrack that fuses hip-hop, salsa and Reggaeton to muy bueno
 effect. The second feature written and directed by former dancer-choreographer Franc. Reyes ("Empire"), pic plays like a mash-up of pulp fiction and telenovela 
while focusing on vengeful drug kingpins, pistol-packing Latinas, cross-generational conflict and ferocious maternal instincts. Homevid payoff could be potent after theatrical foreplay.
Reyes provides exposition and motivation in a briskly efficient prologue that concludes with the killing of a midlevel Bronx drug dealer (Manny Perez) on the very night his wife (Jessica Pimentel) gives birth to their son.
Flash-forward 21 years: The wife, Millie, now older and colder and played by Wanda De Jesus ("Blood Work"), enjoys a comfortable suburban lifestyle financed by her wise management (and careful laundering) of her late husband's ill-gotten gain. (She's especially proud of her early decision to buy Microsoft stock.) Trouble is, every few years, she has to uproot her now two sons and move to another zip code, lest she risk extermination by minions of the same drug lord who ordered her spouse's extermination.
Wilson (Rick Gonzalez), Millie's oldest son, is a straight-A college student who's going through what might be termed a difficult phase. He's sullenly disapproving of his mother's sporadic romantic flings -- one of which resulted in the birth of Randy (Antonio Ortiz), his precocious younger brother -- and he's angered by her latest decision to change addresses. (He'd much rather stay put and continue his romance with a comely coed played by Dania Ramirez.)
And so, after years of keeping her son clueless about his father, Millie takes the rebellious young man down to the basement of their spacious Connecticut home and brings him up to speed. She also opens the safe where she stocks her firepower, and gives the incredulous Wilson his first gun.
To his credit, Reyes refuses to fast-forward Wilson's evolution from callow youth to lethal avenger. Indeed, on those few occasions when he does hold a weapon -- and, rarer still, successfully uses it -- the young man appears distinctly uncomfortable, if not downright trembly. In stark contrast, his mother shoots and scores with intense precision whenever would-be assassins dare to drop by.
Gonzalez walks a fine line, playing a character who most certainly isn't a coward, but isn't Mr. Macho either. He often seems likes a younger, brasher version of John Leguizamo (who, perhaps not coincidentally, played the lead in Reyes' "Empire"). But he's repeatedly overshadowed by De Jesus, who credibly conveys her character's emotional range -- and, just as important, looks pretty badass handling a gun.
If Reyes had pushed his material in another direction, "Illegal Tender" could have come off as a very dark comedy, a Tarantinoesque romp (note the abundance of shapely hitwomen) and/or a perversely edgy thriller with an Oedipal steak. Instead, helmer takes a surprisingly straightforward approach, avoiding ostentatious stylistic flourishes and never allowing anything, not even the gunplay, to get out hand.
As a result, however, pic is too muted to have much lasting impact, and remains modestly diverting only on a scene-to-scene basis. There's no quotable dialogue, no standout action sequence, no flashy supporting performances -- in short, nothing to lift "Illegal Tender" from the level of competent but inconsequential B-movie.
Still, there is that sizzling soundtrack. And De Jesus' authoritative performance, laced with a subtle hint of mature sensuality, might be enough for pic to have unexpectedly strong femme appeal.
