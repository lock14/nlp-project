 “Are we in a movie?” wonders Felix Bonhoeffer, the addled, decrepit screenwriter played by Anthony Hopkins in his  experimental satire “Slipstream.”  “Everything’s a movie,” snaps Bette Lustig (Fionnula Flanagan), an actress in the troubled film Felix has been desperately rewriting. She and Felix have been languishing along with the unhappy cast and crew on the project’s dilapidated set in the Mojave Desert, built years ago (according to the “Slipstream” production notes) for a Dennis Hopper film.  Their exchange encapsulates the single idea bandied about in “Slipstream,” which Mr. Hopkins wrote and directed and for which he composed the score. It is his third film as a director and his first as a quasi-avant-garde filmmaker working well outside the mainstream. It might be described as his “Mulholland Drive,” the far superior David Lynch film to which “Slipstream” owes an enormous debt. (Fellini’s “8 ½” is another obvious inspiration.)  The weary, unassuming Felix is the opposite of Mr. Hopkins’s Richard M. Nixon, Pablo Picasso and Hannibal Lecter, in that it provides him with no opportunities for flashy impersonation or lip-smacking melodrama. As he reaches into his bag of tricks, he can’t resist pulling out images of Nixon and  Hitler (whom he also impersonated, in a television movie). Such self-referential flashes suggest a “why not throw in the kitchen sink?” attitude toward experimentation, not to mention playful self-parody.  Most of the movie takes place inside the head of Felix, whose latest project, a violent melodrama, has fallen apart in midproduction. After the off-screen death of its star, Matt Dobbs (Christian Slater), who had taken the movie into his own hands and begun rewriting the script, its incompetent, Vicodin-addicted director (Gavin Grazer) can’t handle the pressure.  Throwing up his hands, he desperately telephones his producer Harvey Brickman (John Turturro), a raving madman who orders Felix to fix the movie. As the script is rewritten, characters played by Michael Clarke Duncan and Camryn Manheim interject (sometimes on Felix’s own computer) to protest that their roles have been diminished.  As a director Mr. Hopkins, much like his character, comes across as a befuddled observer of his own film, whose style is a compendium of avant-garde techniques and narrative tricks wielded willy-nilly to suggest deeper meanings below a hyperkinetic surface. Among other surreal happenings, time moves backward and forward, objects change color, and Felix has near-death experiences that may or may not be real. The entire story could be interpreted as a dying screenwriter’s life flashing before his eyes.  The film’s centerpiece is a scene from the stalled movie in progress in which Mr. Slater’s character Ray, a psychotic hitman, and his ominous sidekick Geek (Jeffrey Tambor) storm into a highway diner and menace the patrons and staff for their own amusement. If Mr. Slater has a fine time overacting the part of B-movie villain, you can’t help but wonder if Mr. Hopkins knows how mediocre and hackneyed this film within a film is. Is it a joke? Or has he recycled Hannibal Lecter one too many times? Stuffed with references to old movies and insider lore about life on a movie set, much of “Slipstream” feels like a loosely connected series of jokes.  The most prominent among its old-movie references is the original “Invasion of the Body Snatchers,” whose star, Kevin McCarthy, appears in clips from the 1956 film and as his contemporary self. But if that science-fiction classic serves as an all-purpose metaphor for the blurring of reality and movie fantasy, and of the double vision of an actor today and his younger celluloid self, it isn’t woven satisfactorily into the story.  “Slipstream” suggests that after years of diving into the souls of other people, some of them famous, Mr. Hopkins has special knowledge of how the lines between the real people and the fictional characters can blur. It’s not a new idea. The author Neal Gabler identified this phenomenon in the title of his book, “Life, the Movie: How Entertainment Conquered Reality.” But for an actor like Mr. Hopkins, disappearing into another character, especially a historical figure, must be a far more unsettling deconstruction of reality than for the casual moviegoer observing the transformation. That is a notion “Slipstream” might have explored more fruitfully, had it focused its wandering attention span, kept its camera steadier and figured out what it wanted to say.  “Slipstream” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language and some violent images.

Apparently needing to release some private thoughts, musings and images to the world, Anthony Hopkins takes a leap into stunning self-indulgence with his directorial debut, ``Slipstream.'' What can either be viewed as one huge home movie or a plaything from an actor who has been observing other filmmakers for decades, pic strains to convey the interior emotions and ruptures of a vet screenwriter on deadline, and the obnoxious film crew and cast that keeps intruding into his universe. Without the name of Hopkins and those of cast members mixing usually reliable stars and actors, project would be commercially DOA; as it stands, only a miniscule theatrical window seems possible, with most curiosity seekers wading through the undoubtedly extras-filled DVD.
If, among actors-turned-filmmakers, Clint Eastwood stands on one pole of classical restraint, Hopkins certainly stands on its opposite: Mere minutes into ``Slipstream,'' and it's clear that a yen for every conceivable production and post-production tool for image and sound manipulation, plus an itch for the concepts of louder, jumpier, faster and even louder, has consumed Hopkins' desires to make a movie. This is a faux experimental work rather than a genuine one, since it doesn't break with standard storytelling modes and feels suffocating in its imitation of previous break with conventional cinema, starting most obviously with Fellini's ``8 �'' and onward to the dream-like films of David Lynch.
Opening section introduces screenwriter Felix Bonhoeffer (Hopkins), taking in a horserace and a lunch with lady friend Lily (Lana Antonova), before getting stuck in a Los Angeles freeway traffic jam that explodes with an act of severe road rage. Possibly a foretelling of his own death, scene links with discussion of the ``slipstream,'' or the medium to experience past life regressions. This idea, however, is never carried out through the film's course.
Outside a bar at night, Bonhoeffer tries to talk to Gina (Stella Arroyave) and has an encounter with bouncer Mort (Michael Clarke Duncan), who is next seen driving menacing hitman Ray (Christian Slater) to the desert. Ray kills Mort point-blank, and enters a diner with partner Geek (Jeffrey Tambor). In an overlong scene that seems to want to revive bits of ``The Petrified Forest,'' Ray intimidates and terrorizes the patrons, including aging movie queen Bette (Fionnula Flanagan) and hard-working server Bonnie (S. Epatha Merkerson).
Scene cuts, though, revealing a cast and crew making a  movie directed by amateurish Gavin (Gavin Grazer), contending with the problem that Slater's actor self, named Matt Dobbs, soon thereafter dies (off-screen) on the set. Script gal Barbara (Camryn Manheim) tries to keep Gavin on track, but a crisis call to obnoxious producer Harvey Brickman (John Turturro, evidently doing someone's idea of a human Tex Avery cartoon, by way of Harvey Weinstein) only brings more grief to the already ego-stuffed set.
Depiction of the Hollywood shoot seethes with contempt and satiric excess on Hopkins' part, but it in no way jibes with the more interiorized sections devoted to Bonhoeffer, even when he's called upon to devise re-writes to cover for Dobbs' sudden death. What also becomes clearly evident is that underneath a battery of constant optical and digitized visual hiccups and devices (subliminal and shock cuts among them), as well as a nervous soundtrack that surely kept Hopkins' sound engineers and designers working long hours, is a quite conventional tale of an aging writer who can't handle the pressures nor the line between the real and the imagined. 
The veneer of stylistic hyperactivity can't conceal the starkly banal dialogue and a roster of performances that seem, under the circumstances, hardly directed at all. Hopkins himself plays an effectively haunted and distracted figure who suggests an intellectual sidetracked into shlock cinema, but the only other perf of real credibility belongs to Merkerson, one of the few actors in sight who seems to have taken the assignment seriously. A bit featuring ``Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' star Kevin McCarthy strives for cinephile wit, but goes nowhere.
An A-team of technical masters has been assembled by Hopkins, led by the sun-tinged cinematography by Dante Spinotti. Like Eastwood, Hopkins composes his own score, but its sentimentality is at odds with the results on screen. Print screened at Sundance contained no title nor company credits.

A leading man (Christian Slater ) literally overacts himself to death on the Mojave Desert  set of a murder mystery. And that spiritual Native American fella nearby? He's wandered in from a stretch of Oliver Stone 's psychotropic sands, where Jim Morrison  tripped on peyote and Natural Born Killers  marked a high point in self-indulgence. Amazingly, Sir Anthony Hopkins  has raised the bar to batshit insanity with this maddening passion project, which he wrote, directed, scored, and stars in with as much slack-jawed discombobulation as he's likely to inspire in his audience. The synopsis suggests a Charlie Kaufman  meta-riff on showbiz: While screenwriter Felix Bonhoeffer  (Hopkins) bangs out said murder mystery, his characters start popping up in daily life, actors play themselves, dreams and reality bend space and time, blah, blah, it's all in the mind. But who would have guessed that Hopkins's brain was such an impenetrable inland empire? Not just nonlinear, Slipstream  is a non-Euclidean freak-out of repeating sequences, excruciatingly long dissolves, superimposed Hitler  footage, Dolly Parton  look-alikes, ridiculous zooms, "We've lost the plot!" epileptic flashes, sepia-tone inserts, horizontal frame flips, now please let me off I'm going to be sick!  Hopkins claims it's a comedy, and perhaps John Turturro 's live-action cartoon of a mogul producer suggests so, but what does it all mean? That art can be just as shallow as Hollywood ?
