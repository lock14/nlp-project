Despite a marketing campaign that appears bound and determined to make its subject look as grindingly dull as possible, Roll Bounce
 triumphs on almost all counts, hot-wiring a penchant for sports film clich�s to some seriously spot-on Seventies nostalgia that looks and feels true not only in its attention to period detail but also in its all-important portrayal of teenage camaraderie and its attendant angst. Young (but not L�il) Bow Wow plays Southside Chicago rollerskating champ X (short for Xavier), who, along with his trusty band of low-rent buddies, spends the summer of �78 mourning the recent death of his mother and the closing of his local skate palace by taking his A-game uptown and sticking it to the man. In this case, that would be the Rick Jamesian Sweetness (Jonathan) and his multiethnic coterie of pant-suited rollerballers, as unlikely a mix as the BeeGees at CBGB but almost assuredly as entertaining. Puppy love arrives in the form of Good�s all-grown-up girl-next-door Naomi, who hooks up with the endearingly reticent X at the behest of new-girl-on-the-block Sonya (Irvin), while X�s economically displaced dad (McBride) learns to love again even while the memory of his late wife still stings his eyes. At times, Roll Bounce
 feels as though it�s one long parade of coming-of-age film clich�s after another, but Malcolm Lee�s tight, focused direction, coupled with a disarmingly irony-free script from Beauty Shop
�s Norman Vance Jr. and some smart, funny performances from Wow and pals Khleo Thomas (as the mixed-race Mixed Mike), Troy (Paul Wesley), and Naps (Rick Gonzalez) help the film rise above any stereotyped profiling. Replete with nods to Seventies culture that go past the obvious (What�s Happening!!
 references) to the just plain cool (a poster of San Antonio Spurs legendary Iceman Gervin adorns X�s bedroom wall), Roll Bounce
 is the sort of teenage summer fare that just doesn�t get made that much anymore, a younger-skewing Hustle & Flow
 that�d rest easy on the bottom half of a Car Wash
 drive-in double bill. Never mind the immediately obvious comparisons to Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids
 � this is the real deal, and it shows up the likes of pre-Eighties Xanadu
 and Roller Boogie
 poseurs with a funky, grooving panache that�s all its own.


In the opening shot of ''Roll Bounce," a big disco ball shines its shimmering light on a young black man who dreams bold dreams of polyester greatness. Foolhardy? Hollywood doesn't think so. We may live in a time of inline skates and Xtreme Games, but this nostalgic licorice whip of a movie assumes there's still an audience for a straight-faced, family-friendly salute to the 1970s heyday of competitive roller disco.
''Roll Bounce" basically bets that today's kids are willing and able to be transported by an extended episode of ''What's Happening!!" on skates. It courts every baby boomer who aches for another pass at the era that gave us Linda Blair in ''Roller Boogie." It even says scoot over, John Travolta and Sister Sledge, because Snoop Dogg protege Bow Wow (''Like Mike") is here to represent the new generation of disco cool.
And some may actually fall for it.
Most of the preteen fans of Bow Wow (born Shad Gregory Moss), for example, won't care that the movie's script is corny and predictable; they'll just be happy he's shaking his adorable booty on the big screen. That gives writer Norman Vance Jr. (''Beauty Shop") and director Malcolm D. Lee (''The Best Man," ''Undercover Brother") license to be so laughably reverential and sanitizing about this cultural scene that anyone who actually lived through it will wonder if the filmmakers have ever heard of sex, drugs, or Tango hangovers.
''Roll Bounce" begins in 1978, as Chicago's Palisades Gardens is in the process of shutting down, leaving South Side eight-wheelers without a local skating venue. Xavier (Bow Wow), known as X, and friends decide to venture north to inspect the slick Sweetwater rink, where an embarrassing incident leaves them vowing to come back for a skate-off. Only, to win they'll need moves that outdo Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan), the limber and rhythmic Fonzie of this arena.
At the same time, Xavier is dealing with problems on the home front: His widowed, stressed-out father (Chi McBride) can't understand why his son spends so much time spinning his wheels. X, still grieving over his mother's death, finds support in his cartoon-like buddies -- wise-cracking Junior (Brandon T. Jackson), shy guy Boo (Marcus T. Paulk), biracial Mixed Mike (Khleo Thomas), and the big-haired Puerto Rican known as Naps (Rick Gonzalez). He's also trailed by a brace-faced girl (Jurnee Smollett ), charmed by an uptown beauty (Meagan Good), and kind to comic actors (Nick Cannon, Mike Epps) who show up in small roles on par with the script's stale yo' mama jokes. With sitcom swiftness, most complicated issues get resolved before everyone migrates to the big skate-off finale, during which X actually kisses his skate key in a nod to his dead mother.
Yes, it really is that drippy.
The retro soundtrack (''Le Freak"!) is fine, and the skating, supervised by roller disco legend Bill Butler, would be even finer if it wasn't led by Bow Wow, whose clunky-cute moves are easily out-dazzled by the many talented extras.
See ''Roll Bounce" for those extra moments, and definitely see it this weekend if you want 10 percent of your ticket proceeds to go to Operation USA for Hurricane Katrina relief. But please don't see it to relive 1978. Even under a roller disco ball, 1978 was never like this.


         Teen pictures in which kids square off in a competition form a genre unto themselves, yet the warm and wise "Roll Bounce" confounds all expectations. Writer Norman Vance Jr. and director Malcolm D. Lee dare to suggest that winning may not be everything, that a father-and-son relationship may actually be more important than a skate-off, and that it's possible to set a film in 1978 without drowning it in nostalgia and dated fads. "Roll Bounce" sports Afros and bell-bottoms yet doesn't overdo them and always has the feeling of happening in the here and now.
 
  At the same time, "Roll Bounce" has plenty of affectionate humor to balance some serious heart-tugging. And as for the roller-skating, it for sure provides a lot of razzle-dazzle action with lots of virtuoso terpsichorean touches. When the young people of "Roll Bounce" hit the rink with all their nifty moves, "Saturday Night Fever" with John Travolta's disco king immediately comes to mind, and this film has much the same ingredients and appeal of the 1977 classic.
 


         






    Rapper Bow Wow, who in "Like Mike" and "Johnson Family Vacation" emerged as a screen natural, has his most challenging role yet as X — that's for Xavier — a likable, charismatic Chicago South Side teenager who, beneath an often smiling, happy-go-lucky surface, is consumed with grief.
 
  His mother, who also was his best friend, has been dead less than a year, and the loss has also devastated her husband, Curtis (Chi McBride), and created a chasm between father and son wider and deeper than either realize. Neither can let go of her, and neither can admit it. As if this tragedy were not enough, Curtis has been laid off from his job as an airplane designer, and while he looks for work, he hides this setback from his son and 5-year-old daughter Sonya (Busisiwe Irvin).
 
  X and his live-wire pals (Brandon T. Jackson, Marcus T. Paulk, Rick Gonzalez and Khleo Thomas) look forward to spending a lot of their summer hours at the venerable Palisades Gardens Roller Rink not far from the pleasant suburb where they live. But abruptly it shuts down, slated for demolition. So the group, which also includes the feisty new girl on the block, Tori (Jurnee Smollett), reluctantly heads for the North Side's flashy Sweetwater rink, where the hilariously self-absorbed Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan) reigns as the haughty, preening king of the rink.
 
  A skate-off between Sweetness and his crew and X and his group is inevitable.
 
  But as this competition develops, tensions between X and Curtis emerge to dominate the story as father and son thrash through much pain and anger in their attempts to get through to each other.
 
  At the film's Tuesday premiere at the Bridge, Lee aptly described McBride as the film's anchor. He is an actor of formidable resources and presence, and he provides the ballast for bringing out a wrenching portrayal from Bow Wow. "Roll Bounce" has a large cast, and along with Smollett, other vivid presences include Kellita Smith as her mother, Meagan Good as the girl trying to connect with the troubled X, and Mike Epps and Charlie Murphy as a pair of uproariously comical garbage collectors. "Roll Bounce" has lots more than winning on its mind.

As a fad, roller disco always bordered on the ludicrous. How do you glide forward on skates and get down with your bad self at the same time? Very awkwardly. Yet when you behold the teen boogie skaters of Roll Bounce , which is set in Chicago in 1978, those funky/silly movements give you a happy jolt of pleasure. It's hard not to notice that the kitschiness of the dancing is what makes it so...optimistic. The director, Malcolm D. Lee (The Best Man ), immerses us in the eager daze that ruled the final moment before the dawn of hip-hop. He knows how to use the great riffs of Chic and KC &  the Sunshine Band to create a kind of Saturday afternoon fever, and he has a gift for coaxing nuance from the most modest of actors. Bow Wow plays the skate-dance hero in a way that's never too cool to hide what an avid achiever the kid is, and he and his buddies converse in a fiendishly alert middle-class trash talk that keeps Roll Bounce  jumping.


"Roll Bounce" spins an endearing but wildly uneven coming-of-age drama set against the popular '70s phenomenon of "jam skating." Funky disco-era throwback never fully jells with a surprisingly intense central tale of father-son estrangement, strongly acted by Chi McBride and 18-year-old rapper-thesp Bow Wow. Mellower and more downbeat than its exuberant promos would have auds believe, the Fox Searchlight item should perform well in urban markets, though its legs may buckle if middling word of mouth takes hold.
Whatever its shortcomings, lovingly directed pic is recognizably a personal work rooted in a specific time and place -- in this case, Chicago, summer of 1978, when the flashy art of jam skating -- think disco on wheels -- is all the rage, spawning skaters whose routines are as flamboyant as they are competitive.
Moody adolescent Xavier "X" Smith (Bow Wow) spends most of his free time skating with his buddies on the city's South Side. But when their favorite hangout closes, they're forced to relocate to Sweetwater, a huge rink on the North Side, where the boys feel intimidated and unwelcome. Pic manages some decent fish-out-of-water comedy when Xavier and friends first venture into Sweetwater, rendered to the hilt through William Elliott's sprawling retro-fabulous production design.
As if all the beaded curtains and rude clerks weren't enough, the rink is also home to an arrogant, afro-sporting skater named Sweetness (Wesley Jonathan). Flanked by an all-male entourage dressed in iridescent-leather creations (designed by Danielle Hollowell) straight out of some never-made sequel to "Saturday Night Fever," Sweetness is apparently so potent a sex symbol he makes Xavier's prepubescent sister swoon.
Humiliated after their first visit, the boys swear to get even by entering the rink's annual skate-off, dominated by Sweetness.
A backstory emerges at home as Xavier has trouble coping with the recent loss of his mother -- who had encouraged his skating -- while building up a core of resentment toward stern but mildly neglectful dad Curtis (McBride).
Previously known as Li'l Bow Wow, thesp has since retired the diminutive prefix from his name -- which, if the maturity of his performance here is any indication, makes a lot of sense. Soulfully charismatic Bow Wow plays Xavier as a young man always on edge, capable of laughter and high spirits, but with an underlying gravity.
He's matched by McBride, who brings a grave, wounded dignity to Xavier's father. One of the strengths of the screenplay (by "Beauty Shop's" Norman Vance Jr.) is that it doesn't demonize Curtis. Instead, he comes off as a loving, even affectionate father whose own sense of failure -- he hasn't had a job in months -- makes him harder on his son.
This family dynamic ends up dominating pic to an almost unfortunate degree, as Xavier and Curtis have two exchanges so wrenching and emotionally charged they can't help but make the skating seem trivial by comparison.
Helmer Malcolm Lee ("Undercover Brother") devotes little time to showing Xavier and his friends practicing -- their terrific routine at the climactic skate-off feels a tad unearned, though there's no denying the actors' skill on the rink. Lee also has a hard time navigating the jarring tonal shifts from earnest sentiment to trash-talking slapstick. But when the boys do play the dozens, the delivery is forced and the banter itself mostly second-rate.
There are perhaps too many love interests and potential love interests floating around, as Xavier befriends a cute neighborhood girl with braces named Tori (the appealing Jurnee Smollett), then has several awkward run-ins with old friend Naomi (Meagan Good) at Sweetwater. For Curtis' sake, even Tori's alluringly sassy mother Vivian (the game Kellita Smith) is thrown into the mix.
Cinematographer J. Michael Muro makes good use of the generous widescreen format during the skate routines (expertly choreographed by Kishaya Dudley), but lensing is less confident off the rink. Retro music selections are spot-on.

Remember in Bring It On  when the cheerleading squads face off for the final showdown? Y'know, when those furious edits from the stars' faces to their stunt doubles' bodies get so complex that it looks like a bunch of severed limbs in a kaleidosopic jumble. Now imagine the same thing with a bunch of dudes in 70's House  costumeson skates. OK, it's true, nobody expects rapper-actor Bow Wow  to do rolling back flips with a comb in his pocket (N.B.: Bow Wow is not "Lil" anymore. Like Stevie Wonder  before him, he's dropped that diminutive, though apparently has a compelling reason for retaining "Bow Wow"). But if you know the climactic skate-off is gonna be almost all cutaways, you better be dealing with some Gabrielle Union size charisma on the dramedy side. As Xavier, a South Side Chicago kid at odds with his gruff dad (Boston Public 's regimented softie Chi McBride ) after his mom's death, Bow Wow isn't bad. But he and the dudes who fill out X's crew never quite nail the desired What's Happening!!   vibe. There is a certain warmth here, though, as these working-class pals shyly hit the glitzy crosstown rink. Unfortunately, despite the slamming soundtrack, their eventual rollerjam rivalry doesn't really get the blood up. Their swanky foes are rich white clowns inexplicably led by a proto-Prince figure named "Sweetness" (embodied with hot-to-death irony by Wesley Jonathan ). And unlike Bring It On  or even Drumline , it never feels like anything's at stake. Cameos like Mike Epps  and Charlie Murphy  as volatile sanitation engineers are fun, though too brief. Nick Cannon  and Wayne Brady  camp it up as loverman rink employees. But ultimately, it's Jurnee Smollett , as the new brace-face babe in town, who shines like a glittering unicorn iron-on. Smollett gets the movie's best snaps, and she savors them. Her enforced ugly-duckling status is dubious throughout. With this much round-the-way charm, she'd never need Roll Bounce 's predictable Swan -style reveal to pull a date for a couples skate.
