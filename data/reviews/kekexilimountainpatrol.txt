         Kekexili is more than one of the most remote and starkly beautiful locations on Earth. It's a place with a spirit of its own, a spirit that's been infused into the strong and gritty Chinese import "Mountain Patrol: Kekexili." About four miles high on the Tibetan plateau, Kekexili is so remote and inhospitable, someone says, that "each step you take might be the first human footprints since the world began."
 
  Making lots of hoof prints are the chiru, or Tibetan antelopes, animals that are graceful beyond words and use the Kekexili as their habitat and breeding grounds. Because their coats are exceptionally soft, the animals have been the targets of poachers so successful that by the 1990s the antelope population had declined from an estimated 1 million to 10,000.
 


         






    Things have in fact gotten so bad that the local people formed a mountain patrol to combat the poachers. The film, based on a true story, opens with the murder of a patrol member, a death that attracts the interest of Ga Yu (Zhang Lei), a photojournalist from far-off Beijing.
 
  Not surprisingly, given China's history in Tibet, Ri Tai (veteran Tibetan actor Duo Bujie), the steely-eyed leader of the patrol, is not exactly thrilled to see the new arrival. But the journalist says his publication can help with Ri Tai's dream of getting the Kekexili declared a nature preserve, and the leader allows him to tag along on his group's next mountain foray.
 
  To this point, "Mountain Patrol" comes off as involving but fairly standard, like a Chinese version of an old Hollywood western, complete with emotional goodbyes to loved ones as the patrol heads out into the unknown like a John Ford cavalry unit. Could this be the work that became the first Mainland movie to win Taiwan's Golden Horse award as the best Chinese language film of 2004, besting such heavy hitters as Wong Kar-wai's "2046" and "Infernal Affairs III"?
 
  But Kekexili is such a brutal, unforgiving place that it doesn't allow any film shot there to hold on to its innocence. If nothing else the area's look (captured by cinematographer Cao Yu, who also won a Golden Horse) is unsettling in its barren neo-lunar vastness.
 
  And being in this pitiless environment stiffens the spine of the film's tale.
 
  The air is so thin that any kind of exertion is a hazard, and the place is so remote that even the smallest miscalculation can put you at grave risk of your life in the middle of nowhere.
 
  These kinds of merciless conditions lead to a culture that is stoic about life and death and a story that will surprise you by its willingness to embrace that unsentimental natural world. The experience of these Tibetans, we are told, eventually moved all of China, and "Mountain Patrol: Kekexili" leaves no doubt as to why.

 The mountains that rise from the Tibetan plateau make a suitably dramatic backdrop for this story about the murderous cost we humans exact on the natural world. Based on depressingly true events, "Mountain Patrol: Kekexili" tracks the heroic efforts of a small group of Tibetans   struggling to keep the Tibetan antelope, or chiru, from extinction. Although hunting the antelope was made illegal in the 1970's — you need to kill the animal to harvest its wool, which is turned into a rare commodity  called shahtoosh — the population dwindled precariously,  beginning in  the late 1980's and early 90's, because enough wealthy consumers had no qualms about hitting the boldface scene with shahtoosh on their shoulders and blood on their hands.  If that sounds like a recipe for piety and sob stories about cute critters, think again. Written and directed by Lu Chuan, whose first feature was  the well-received  "Missing Gun," "Mountain Patrol" is as tough and unsparing as its backdrop, a blood-boiling environmental thriller with a dash of Sergio Leone. Although the traffic in endangered wildlife gives the film its headline hook — you need to kill three to five antelopes to make one shahtoosh shawl — the story that briskly unfolds has as much to do with man's inhumanity to man as to his fellow creatures. Which is why, given China's historic and violent aggression against the Tibetan people, it's hard not to read the film on several levels at once.  The way into this unlikely nail-biter is through a young Beijing photojournalist, Ga Yu (Zhang Lei), who lands in this otherworldly  region in 1996,   armed with a camera and a well of idealism. His quarry is a mountain patrol, led by a former soldier, Ri Tai (Duo Bujie), that tracks poachers who, with their automatic weapons and hired skinners, leave thousands of antelope carcasses across the plateau. More action-oriented than expository-minded, Mr. Lu never explains why a Chinese journalist would find this story especially newsworthy. Ga Yu simply shows up, slips into his new environs (it helps that he is part Tibetan) and proves himself a quick study, whether learning the proper way to cut meat — draw the knife toward your body, away from your companions — or hopping a ride with the patrol.  Mr. Lu has an appreciable sense of narrative economy,  and it isn't long before the photographer is on the desolate road with the patrol in Kekexili, a region in the northwestern part of the plateau. Filled with astonishing vistas and a minimum of chatter,  this is the kind of film that invites you in with beauty, only to surprise and even shock you with a sudden burst of violence. The images of the men driving their trucks and dwarfed against the mountains recall, however fleetingly, the sweeping sight of pioneers framed against a different range in John Ford's "Wagon Master." Mr. Lu, a graduate of the Beijing Film Academy, has clearly watched his share of westerns, which is why still other scenes evoke Leone and, when two men, gasping for oxygen and spitting blood, chase each other until they drop, even Erich von Stroheim.  Despite the sporadic film-school allusions, "Mountain Patrol" has its own very specific take on things. Films about environmental catastrophes tend to wax preachy, putting pedagogy and scolding above art.  This one, for all its sorrow and the throb of righteous anger it provokes (only about 50,000 antelopes remain),  is more than anything a work of creative imagination. Filled with strange and horrible visions, it draws you in again and again, not with characters, who all  remain at a psychological remove, but with set pieces that distill the story's life-and-death struggle to its essence. The extraordinary scene of one  man  sinking into quicksand is characteristically potent, a reminder of the fragility of human life and the unblinking power of the world we dominate, to our peril.
By their nature, conservationist melodramas are tough to put over: Unless you torture science Roland Emmerich style, the concrete concerns are long-term (save the water, the whales, or the woods), and the principles, vacuum-packed by narrative pressure, can easily veer off into Ludditic sanctimony. The best you can hope for is political critique an easy anti-globalism dunk for the well-intentioned, you'd think, except no one yet knows how to satisfy our hunger for gasoline, bananas, and paper, and how to feed several billion scrounge-workers, without inevitably laying waste to the third world. The 2004 Chinese adventure saga Mountain Patrol: Kekexili , which takes on the poaching of the endangered Tibetan antelope, skirts the hairier questions by staying on one hand enthrallingly close to the ground, and on the other hand by trucking in Hollywood -style epicness. The sense of fundamental outrage does not evolve into asking who's slaughtering wildlife, and why, but instead basks before mountains saturated with unearthly tropospheric light. For better or worse, no film of the last decade, not even Malick's The New World , has displayed such a ferocious intimacy with extreme landscape.
Lu Chuan 's film is a full-on elegy for a band of paramilitary volunteers that in the mid '90s patrolled the titular highlands encompassing hunks of Tibet , Qinghai Province , and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region , prowling after outlaw hunters. The combat was both genuine and hopelessthe patrol could only confiscate and fine, not arrest or defend themselves with gunfire, while the poachers regularly assassinated lone guards and shot over their shoulders. Brought in from Beijing  after one such murder, an obligatorily fresh-faced reporter (Zhang Lei ) is our eyes and ears among the motley, outlaw-glam wild bunch, led by a grizzled, taciturn man-of-ideals (Duo Bujie). Together they launch out onto the endless frontier for a weeks-long sojourn of frustration, ethical muddiness, and butcher-block residue. (Lu makes the most out of post-poaching carnage, acres evenly littered with bloodied carcasses or seized pelts.) Vultures attend the funeral services, and pulmonary edema is a pervasive threat. The terrain is both victim and destiny-dealeran encounter with desert quicksand is just as viscerally roiling as it was in the matinee programmers of George Lucas 's childhood, while getting a truck loosed from a bog of icy mud becomes a major dramatic issue. Tellingly, few antelope are seenas if the hopes for a national preserve, and therefore state policing, are already dashed.
No recent Chinese film we've seen detours this far away from the noncommittal-observational mode of Jia Zhangke indeed, Kekexili  was co-produced by Columbia and National Geographic , and Lu's muscular realism makes it a project Anthony Minghella  would be proud of, if not one he'd have the modesty to achieve. For its part, the movie seems, for its national cinema, unusually fervent about its progressive cause and even Taoist in its devotion to the verities of the immediate environment. But for all of its well-schooled orthodoxy and visual splendor, Kekexili  remains somewhat off-kilterthe characters' passionate wartime camaraderie and doomed sense of martyrdom aren't quite reflected in the facts of volunteer service and devotion to a balanced ecosystem. The enemy isn't invading hordes but scattered, scrambling, panicking Chinese peasants trying to feed themselves by way of the West's thriving market for fur. Lu isn't afraid of the irony his story churns up, but the real villainsthe government that provides the west China populace few other options and the international consumers who pony up for peltsare left unaddressed. Lu would've had to trace out an entire Traffic -style tapestry to sensibly contextualize the heroic action on the plateau.
