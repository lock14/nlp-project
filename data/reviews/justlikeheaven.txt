Forget that tired old Batman/Superman hypothetical � what inquiring minds really want to know is who�d win the Romantic Comedy Battle Royale: upstart Reese Witherspoon or grand champion Meg Ryan? Odds are still on Ryan by a perky, button nose, but Witherspoon�s winsome, charming turn in this lighter-than-air fare comes within a legally blond lock of snatching the heartstrings from Ryan�s exemplary romantic r�sum�. Just Like Heaven
 is just like the Cure in more than name alone; as in Robert Smith�s most audacious and memorable goth pop standards, it snatches joy from the teeth of despair and life from the beyond the pale, wrapping everything up in a methodically melodic and lyrically neat black bow before vaporizing beyond a veil of yesterday�s tears and tomorrow�s fairy-tale infatuations � it�s got a great beat and you can die to it. Despite its gooey marketing campaigns, which paint the film as something of a Lifeless in Seattle
, Waters� film is at its heart a grim affair, linking as it does two emotionally dead people in that most notoriously alive of American cities, San Francisco, and then having the nerve to make one of them truly, madly, deeply dead. Yes, we�ve seen this sort of fabulism before, and better done, too, but Just Like Heaven
 nimbly sidesteps the abundant clich�s through sheer dint of the acting skills on display here. Ruffalo, the thinking-woman�s romantic ideal, is David, a heartsick widower who leases the tony hilltop home of the late Elizabeth (Witherspoon), a workaholic physician whose connection to the here and now was inauspiciously severed in the squeal of rain-slicked brakes one foggy Frisco evening. After moving into the former Elizabeth�s homey digs, all the mournful David can manage is a persistent vegetative state sandbagged by gallons of alcohol and a general, unspoken desire to drop dead himself. It takes the appearance of Elizabeth�s discorporeal spirit to wake him from his doomy reverie and forsake the booze in favor of getting rid of this initially unwelcome visitor. Together the pair embark on a quest to discover who Elizabeth was (or is, or something) � her memories of her past life are hazy-vague at best � and, wouldn�t you know it, fall in love in the process. Waters helmed the bitchy, depressing comedy Mean Girls
 most recently, but Just Like Heaven
 hasn�t a barbed bone in its body, relying instead on the polished scriptwork of longtime comedy writers Peter Tolan and Leslie Dixon (adapting from a novel by Mark Levy). Ruffalo does intellectual gloom like no one else these days and here hones his comic skills � physical, even � to razor�s edge, buoyed by the exuberantly winning Donal Logue (The Tao of Steve) 
 and Napoleon Dynamite
�s Jon Heder, who mumbles his way through a friendly psychic role with knowing lids forever at half-mast. For all its funky amour de mort
, Just Like Heaven
 is no Topper
, mind you. There�s a manipulative streak to the proceedings, and you�d have to be stone cold dead not to grasp the inevitable outcome long before the third act, but it�s a professionally handled sort of emotional manipulation common to its genre, dating back to  Blithe Spirit
 and, somewhat less memorably, The Ghost and Mrs. Muir
. And in the face of Witherspoon�s unrepentant charms, it�s very difficult to resist.


Quick: A loved one is in a deep coma. What to do? You could obey the living will. Or, were you inclined to think like a Hollywood movie, you could sublet her apartment, wait for her spirit to show up and fall in love with the new tenant, then ask said spirit what it wants.
If this spirit is a smidgen like Reese Witherspoon's in the new romantic comedy ''Just Like Heaven," the answer will almost certainly be, ''I want to live!" Directed by Mark Waters (''Mean Girls"), the movie wants all you girls to know that should medical misfortune come your way, just hold on. Your soul will find your soul mate, then love will set you free.
Witherspoon plays Elizabeth, a meticulous go-getter physician in San Francisco. When she's not saving lives during 26-hour rotations, Elizabeth is stealing catnaps in the staff lounge, dreaming she's in a vast, softly lit Eden that could be mistaken for a Sarah McLachlan video. The women doctors in relationships speak to her in sighs (''You're so lucky that all you have to worry about is work"), as though her singleness has made her disabled. All her sister (Dina Waters) wants her to do is get a man, which Elizabeth is about to do when a truck hits her.
Mark Ruffalo is David, the sad-sack widower who moves into Elizabeth's gorgeous apartment after her accident. In no time he turns her Pottery Barn into a frat house so unkempt that Elizabeth comes all the way from limbo to insist he spruce up the place. What Elizabeth doesn't know is that she's an apparition. David's not sure, either. Drunk and depressed, he hires ghost-busters and an exorcist in a futile attempt to get rid of her. Eventually, Jon Heder (of ''Napoleon Dynamite" fame), playing an occult bookseller with a sixth sense, is called in to confirm that Elizabeth is not a figment of David's loneliness. She's a lost soul who doesn't remember who she is. And the movie concocts shenanigans as she and David try to figure out who she was.
Ruffalo seems stuck in gimmicky romances, having gamely agreed to love the 13-year-old trapped in Jennifer Garner's body in ''13 Going on 30," Gwyneth Paltrow's flight attendant in ''View From the Top," and Jennifer Aniston as the possible daughter of the lovers in ''The Graduate" in the upcoming ''Rumor Has It." He can be a fierce actor, but in comedies, he's not a leading man, he's a puppy. Yet he and Witherspoon demonstrate screwball-comedy teamwork, with him providing the laid-back bafflement and her bringing the pluck.
Her zip is contagious, which is why none of the disdainful testimonials from Elizabeth's co-workers and neighbors accusing her of being a one-track-mind drip seems accurate. Elizabeth is sociable, supportive, kind, and, above all, played by Reese Witherspoon. But the movie is determined to make this woman out to be a soulless climber who cared too much about her career and must be set straight. (I don't know many 30-ish doctors who are encouraged to have time for much else.)
Nonetheless, ''Just Like Heaven" suggests that a post-coma Elizabeth might understand what life is truly all about. Of course, if being alive means having to live in this movie, maybe she was better off the way she was.

         Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo are two of the most appealing and versatile young actors in the movies, and in "Just Like Heaven," which proceeds from one shameless tear-jerking contrivance to the next, they earn every cent of their salaries. They perform this sentimental twaddle with a conviction that borders on the absolute, and they inspire respect for their unshakable professionalism. They actually seem to believe in what they're doing in a movie that's likely to appeal only to the most susceptible and uncritical romantics.
 
  Witherspoon's Elizabeth is a selflessly dedicated and overworked physician on the staff of a San Francisco hospital who has just received an important promotion. She's headed to a blind date when a huge truck collides with her car during a rainstorm, bringing about the circumstances that result in Elizabeth's sister (Dina Waters) subletting Elizabeth's choice apartment, complete with spectacular views and a fireplace in a vintage hillside corner building. Ruffalo's David, a landscape architect unable to shake off the death of his wife two years earlier despite the best efforts of his therapist pal (Donal Logue, always welcome but underused here), is so taken with the attractive apartment that he snaps it up.
 


         






    The image of Elizabeth soon appears, demanding to know what David is doing in her place. Before one can say "Blithe Spirit," David realizes that only he can see Elizabeth, who is unaccountably hard to convince that she is but spirit and not flesh. Gradually she accepts her ethereal state, and the two embark on a quest to discover her identity and what happened to her. Predictably, David falls in love with Elizabeth. No amount of twists and turns, most of them labored, in Peter Tolan and Leslie Dixon's screenplay based on Marc Levy's novel "If Only It Were True," can deflect "Just Like Heaven's" predictability. Director Mark Waters, who takes a very earnest tone, is not likely to repeat the success of his "Mean Girls," unless Witherspoon's box-office appeal proves truly phenomenal.
 
  There are moments when it is possible, with effort, to forget the plot and its tired premise and enjoy Witherspoon and Ruffalo's chemistry and imagine they are in another movie.
 
  But never for long. There's always another development even less believable than the last to remind one that what's on the screen is inescapably "Just Like Heaven."

It's a very special and especially icky romantic comedy that can distract audiences from the daisy-bouquet charms of Reese Witherspoon and get us musing instead about the last days of Terri Schiavo. But such are the jarring purgatorial properties of Just Like Heaven , a meet-cute contraption in which the pluck of a girl who may be dead on the outside but is lively of spirit on the inside resuscitates the emotional heart of a boy who's alive on the outside but nearly dead of grief within. We seem invited to look at Witherspoon, playing both an inert accident victim named Elizabeth as well as the twinkling embodiment of Elizabeth's perfectly ambulatory soul, and consider whether Ms. Schiavo, had she been shown the same consideration as the fictional Elizabeth, might have miraculously risen, dewy and pert, ready to sing ''Sweet Home Alabama.''
That Just Like Heaven  succeeds at all  at least for teenage girls with limited interest in the drafting of living wills  is due entirely to Witherspoon's can-do charisma, her tightly packed blend of city sophistication and country wholesomeness. Playing a San Francisco doctor whose devotion to work and family has left her no time for romance, the star hustles like Tinkerbell to keep the mood light. But the story just ain't a floaty one, much as Mean Girls  director Mark Waters and screenwriters Peter Tolan and Leslie Dixon insist it can be. As the guy Elizabeth is fated to meet, Mark Ruffalo brings his trademark sad cuteness/cute sadness, a look of despair that assumes more gravitas than fits a picture aiming for deathbed fun.


Considerably more mushy than madcap, "Just Like Heaven" is as uneven as the topography of its San Francisco locales, but the amiable peaks mostly offset the flat stretches and valleys. A variation on a very old meet-cute theme with a touch of otherworldly romance, pic will need to tap deeply into the "Ghost" audience, given the dearth of laughs for manly men. Otherwise, prospects of a robust box office life (and more likely, afterlife) rely almost entirely on the warming glow of Reese Witherspoon's abundant charms.
Directed by Mark Waters, on something of a roll coming off "Mean Girls" and "Freaky Friday," "Heaven" introduces Elizabeth (Witherspoon) as a driven young ER doctor whose work/personal balance is seriously out of whack. When hospital colleagues grouse about juggling such entanglements, one tells her she's "lucky that all you worry about is work."
A fast-moving truck later and she's suddenly appearing in spectral form, haunting the emotionally wounded David (Mark Ruffalo), who has sublet her apartment. David, it turns out, is sleepwalking through life following his wife's death, and after trying to convince Elizabeth that she's dead, gradually begins to form an attachment to her.
Pic is weakest through these early stages, as the pair go about trying to discover who Elizabeth is/was and what happened to her. There are some stabs at broader comedy here -- and even wry references to the ghost(busting) of movie spirits past, since David, a la "Topper," is the only one who can see Elizabeth, yielding merry mix-ups when he decides to meet his buddy Jack (Donal Logue) at the local pub.
For the most part, though, Peter Tolan and Leslie Dixon's adaptation of Marc Levy's novel hews toward the melancholy, propelled by the idea that David is every bit as much trapped between life and death as Elizabeth. And while it's perhaps necessary to establish that anguish, Ruffalo's performance proves so dour initially as he wallows in depression that it leeches some of the story's vitality.
Just when the movie appears moribund, however, the narrative comes modestly alive thanks to a reasonably clever plot twist establishing a much-needed sense of jeopardy. And as evidenced by the teenage girls who audibly sighed at the more shamelessly romantic flourishes, the allure of an emotional connection that can overcome physical boundaries has a lucrative track record.
The irony here is that Waters was hired primarily for his comedic gifts, and delivers more pointedly on the dramatic front. Indeed, the main problem is there are too few laugh-out-loud sequences for what's billed as a comedy, creating something of a marketing dilemma.
Witherspoon is such a winning presence as to help instill pathos in Elizabeth's situation, but she isn't displaying the buoyant personality that made the "Legally Blonde" franchise percolate. In her early encounters with David, rather, she comes across as something of a shrew.
Fortunately, the principals receive solid support in smallish roles from Logue, Dina Waters as Elizabeth's sister and Ivana Milicevic as David's seductive neighbor, with a disappointingly flat turn by "Napoleon Dynamite's" Jon Heder as a half-baked occult bookstore dude from whom David solicits advice.
Effects-work nicely conveys Elizabeth's wraithlike predicament -- from popping up in the fridge to strolling through a table -- which keeps Witherspoon in the same outfit for much of the film. Rolfe Kent delivers a score that captures the wistful tone without being cloying.
In a sense, then, Waters ultimately accomplishes the oldest of fairy tale tricks -- generating just enough magic to rouse a slumbering movie from its trance, even if the final experience is something less than heaven.

Good news for horror fans: Six years after Haley Joel Osment  first saw dead people, the gimmick is finally safe for romantic comedy. Surely the end of the cycle is nigh. Reese Witherspoon  stars as overworked internist Elizabeth, the latest movie character who can't quite figure out if she's dead or alive, after a 26-hour stretch at the hospital leads to a possibly fatal car accident. When lost and lonely David (a bewildered Mark Ruffalo ) moves into Elizabeth's San Francisco apartment, he soon discovers that he'll have to share its spacious accommodations with a peculiarly energetic ghost playing the role of mother, AA counselor, and overall killjoy. Elizabeth, of course, is only visible to David, setting up lots of confused third-party reaction shots, awkward physical comedy, and repeated jokes about "seeing someone." Witherspoon's oft charming perkiness is merely patronizing here, but mid-'90s MTV  staple Donal Logue  steals every scene he's in as an ethically challenged therapist. Fraught with anxiety about the spiritual consequences of overwork, Just Like Heaven  feels contemporary enough, but the movie's level of imagination is best captured by its painfully literal-minded soundtrack, which includes such topical material as "Just My Imagination," "I Put a Spell on You," and the theme from Ghostbusters .
