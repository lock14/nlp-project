Muscling for rank in the crowded box-office speedway, this Pixar contender takes an early lead but loses momentum in the middle third. �This movie is too long,� remarked my four-year-old companion. �He needs to go back to the race track.� We start off with a bang as rookie race-car Lightning McQueen (the voice of Wilson) roars to a photo finish with gentlemanly retiring champion the King (Richard Petty) and obnoxious upstart Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton). At stake is sponsorship by the Dinoco oil company and something called the Piston Cup. (�Did what in his cup?� a character inevitably jokes.) The opening scene is Pixar at its best: a miraculously realized otherworld populated entirely by motor vehicles, rendered with gorgeous detail and rambunctious energy that should delight audiences of any age. The visuals are dense and layered � the stadium audience of thousands of cars does �the wave� by flashing their headlights, and Lightning McQueen really does look like Wilson � and the gags come at a rapid clip. (McQueen�s sponsor is the unglamorous Rust-Eeze Medicated Bumper Ointment, and its spokesmen are ramshackle incarnations of Tom and Ray Magliozzi.) But McQueen has to learn the error of his ways (�I�m a one-man show,� he insists, eschewing a crew chief), so the movie strands him in Radiator Springs, a dilapidated stop on historic Route 66, where he learns the true meaning of friendship from the locals: a sexy Porsche (Hunt), a rusty tow-truck (Larry the Cable Guy), two Italian tire specialists (Shalhoub and Quaroni), and Doc (Newman), who might or might not be a retired racer himself. Life is slow in Radiator Springs, and the movie is too, even though its heart is in the right place � championing vanishing small-town America. (Regrettably, a sentimental Randy Newman song reminds that �main street isn�t main street anymore,� while angling for an Oscar.) It�s fine enough, and the characters are cutely conceived � Quaroni�s powder-blue, three-wheeled Eurotruck steals the show � but the film�s energy dribbles out like leaked oil while McQueen struggles to pave a road and romance Sally. A slew of writers and two script doctors (Robert L. Baird and Dan Gerson, who helped turn the story of Chicken Little
 into a massive clusterfuck with an alien invasion) keep churning out the jokes (George Carlin is a VW minibus with psychedelic flashbacks and organic biodiesel), but the movie stalls on its heavy-handed messages, which are pitched at an adult level. Can children understand an elegy for historic roadside America? Few in our audience could, and several viewers were carried out fussing. The best all-ages movies, like Toy Story
 and Dreamworks�s Shrek
, work well on multiple levels, with clever asides tucked into a classical quest narrative. Cars
 is a nostalgic and at times slowly paced movie about adult problems, and its story is fundamentally less engaging. It picks back up at the end, to be sure, but doesn�t regain its lead. Never really quite great, it�s still a good enough diversion for the family and should please adult fans of racing.

         If there is a master list somewhere of the things most Americans love, automobiles and animated films — particularly those by the computer wizards at Pixar — are surely near the top. So it's no shock that Pixar's latest, "Cars," turned out so well, but what's surprising about this supremely engaging film is the source of its curb appeal: It has heart.
 
  The recent trend in the field has been to go the wiseguy route. Disney, Fox, DreamWorks and others have led us to equate computer animation with bulletproof repartee and snappy patter, turning every creature on the planet into a Borscht Belt comedian. It's not that those films haven't been a treat, or that "Cars" doesn't have its share of gags that make you laugh out loud. But director John Lasseter's latest is not powered by glibness and speed but by warmth, emotion and good-hearted charm. It offers the kinds of sensations all Hollywood once did, and it makes us remember why those films made us care.
 


         






    Like those movies, "Cars" does this with a plot whose finish line can be seen miles away. It's the story of a self-absorbed hotshot racer named Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson) who takes an unexpected detour and learns what is really important in life.
 
  One of the hidden pleasures of "Cars" is the gradual realization that our journey as an audience is more like McQueen's than we want to admit, that what is happening to Lightning is happening to us as well. We too may initially feel that we don't have the time or interest for a film like this. But as we downshift our preconceptions and get into the spirit of the movie, we find it's just the thing we've been needing.
 
  Though six writers, including Lasseter and the film's co-director, Joe Ranft, are credited with the "Cars" script, the essence of the film flows from Lasseter, from the things he cares about and enjoys. Those include a love of things automotive that began when he was a teenager working at the Whittier Chevrolet dealership that employed his father.
 
  Because it is intent on taking its time, "Cars" may seem slow getting started. What pulls us in gradually and keeps us involved is Lasseter's great gift for character, his ability to create cars that don't just have personality but are also bright and funny personalities in their own right.
 
 
Lightning McQueen, Wilson's affable voice notwithstanding, is initially the least likable of the lot. A top contender for the Piston Cup, a racer given to boasting "I eat losers for breakfast," Lightning is the arrogant rookie sensation who doesn't believe he needs anyone else in his life.
 
  What he does think he needs is a new sponsor. Embarrassed by his association with Rusty and Dusty Rust-eze (voiced by Tom and Ray Magliozzi, the hosts of "Car Talk" on National Public Radio), purveyors of "Medicated Bumper Ointment," he finds the road to a higher class of sponsor involves a big race with Strip Weathers, a.k.a. "The King" (racing ace Richard Petty) and unfriendly Chick "Thunder" Hicks (Michael Keaton), a car so evil he's sponsored by HBT, Hostile Bank Takeovers.
 
  On his way to that race, Lightning is forced to spend considerable time in Radiator Springs, "Gateway to Ornament Valley," a small Western town on old Route 66 now hanging on for dear life, a place time — and the big interstate freeway system — has passed by.
 
  Here he meets a whole gang of folks who know how to make you smile.
 
  There's aging hippie Filmore (George Carlin), a VW bus with a license plate for a hipster goatee and a penchant for selling organic fuel. There's racing snob Luigi (Tony Shalhoub) of Luigi's Casa Della Tires, "Home of the Leaning Tower of Tires."
 
  On the more serious side, there is cranky Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), the town judge who is given to growling "I want his hood on a platter," and fetching Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt), a Porsche 911 from Los Angeles who gave it all up for life in the slow lane.
 
  Best of all is an ancient bucktoothed tow truck called, I kid you not, Tow Mater. As voiced by comic Larry the Cable Guy in a rare G-rated mode, this irrepressibly good-natured hillbilly sidekick is the friendliest guy in town and a character so out-and-out irresistible he drives away with the movie.
 
  "Cars" is not only in love with cars, it's also mad about the American West in general and the romance of Route 66, the legendary Mother Road, in particular.
 
  The film is a visual valentine to such things as breathtaking desert scenery, classic neon signs and kitschy motels with rooms shaped like wigwams. It looks back longingly to the era when the idea was "not to make great time but to have a great time." And it makes us wonder what we gave up to get to where we are.

 In general release.   

Having fallen in love with a bunch of computer-animated, anthropomorphized vehicles who express emotion with eyes made from windshields and smiles from metallic front grills, I do believe the exemplary Pixar team who made the beguiling comedy adventure Cars  could draw a mote of dust and a pair of socks and turn them into characters worth caring about. I also bet that any story the Pixarites came up with about dust and socks (with John Ratzenberger lending his voice to the supporting role of the shoelace) is bound to be more rewarding than 90 percent of anything coming out of Hollywood Blockbusterville this summer. As it is, this witty charmer of an automotive adventure  part catnip for NASCAR enthusiasts, part nostalgia trip for fanciers of Route 66 and Paul Newman  features a 1951 Hudson Hornet, a rusty tow truck, a hippy-dippy 1960 VW bus, and a herd of tractors prone to tipping over and farting exhaust fumes of fright. And I'd rather spend time with them than with all the code-cracking sleuths The Da Vinci Code  has to offer.
For the millions who love Richard Petty, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Mario Andretti, and Michael Schumacher, so much the better: Playing animated four-wheel versions of themselves (on the assumption that a man is  what he drives), the voices of the real track stars blend easily with those of more recognizable thespians in the instructive story of hotshot race-car rookie Lightning McQueen. Just a curlicue of vocal cockiness courtesy of Owen Wilson is enough to convey the crucial fact that McQueen  a my-way-or-the-highway type who claims not to need no help from no one  is, in fact, precisely the kind who needs to learn how to slow down and smell the off-ramps. The picture opens with a race (featuring cars, don't forget, with big expressive eyeballs) as rigorously accurate for aficionados as it is fun for novices. And the unbeatable Pixar skill at rendering texture, perspective, background, movement, and detail is so casual in its dazzle that it's tempting to take the up-close view, vertiginous feel, and aerodynamic accuracy of racetrack curves rounded at lightning speed for granted.
Anyhow, a three-way finish for McQueen, the reigning race champ Strip ''The King'' Weathers (that's Petty), and showboating corner cutter Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) forces an elimination race for the Piston Cup in L.A. And as he heads out to compete (hauled by Mack, a 1985 Super-Liner voiced by behind-the-mike mainstay John Ratzenberger), an accidental detour strands McQueen off the interstate in Radiator Springs.
That's where Cars  switches from knowing, needling observer of NASCAR culture (and its  attendant endorsement perks) and becomes avuncular promoter of small-town life as seen in loving photo books about Route 66 ghost towns. Stalled in a poky burg all but out of business since the interstate siphoned tourist traffic away, an impatient McQueen stays only under duress, educated by townsfolk including local judge Doc Hudson (Newman, himself a car racer, in the role of a 1951 jalopy that fits the 81-year-old actor like a trophy), the loyal and hee-hawing tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and the onetime fast-lane Porsche 911, Sally Carrera (Bonnie Hunt, another favorite Pixar vocalizer).
The lesson McQueen learns  that loyalty,  community, and an appreciation of life's detours matter as much as or more than individual advancement  isn't anything we haven't been fed a hundred times, most recently explained by an animated raccoon and his foraging buddies in Over the Hedge , and learned by Michael J. Fox 15 years ago in Doc Hollywood . But as the movie slows down to take in the scenery in and around imaginary, iconic Radiator Springs  a dusty Shangri-la out of Happy Days , a paean to tail fins and sunsets and mesas and neon, embroidered with some of Randy Newman's prettiest songwriting about little pleasures  Cars  opens, gently and delicately, into something even more shimmering and soulful than the computerized glint of sunlight on car metal. Reigning Pixar director John Lasseter grew up amid California car culture, the son of a Chevy parts-department manager, and  with co-director Joe Ranft (who died, tragically, in a car accident before the  picture was completed) and the Pixar team  has  created a work of American art as classic as it is modern. Note to tourists: Leave before the very end of the credits and you'll miss some of the best and funniest roadside sights.

 THE temptation to write about "Cars" using automotive metaphors may be unwise, but it's also irresistible. You could say, for instance, that the film — the first directed by the Pixar guru John Lasseter  since the company's 1999 hit "Toy Story 2" — tools along at an easy clip, rather like a Volvo station wagon en route to another family vacation. At no point does it spin out of control, much less venture off-road. Instead, the film just putt, putt, putts along, a shining model of  technological progress and consumer safety. But, as Ed (Big Daddy) Roth  might say, chrome don't get you home and neither does 3D animation.  Mr. Roth  was the creator of a delightfully unappetizing cartoon rodent called Rat Fink, a kind of anti-Mickey Mouse mascot for the hot-rod set. Given Pixar's carefully cultivated — and, for the most part, justified — reputation as a modestly maverick outfit, it would be nice to think that a decal of Rat Fink adorns the computers of at least a couple of the film's many, many animators. But both in its ingratiating vibe and bland execution, "Cars" is nothing if not totally, disappointingly new-age Disney,  the story of a little cherry-red race car, Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), who can win the race of life only after he learns the value of friendship and the curvy appeal of Porsche Carrera (Bonnie Hunt).  Right off we know we're not in Kansas anymore or, for that matter, Monstropolis, home to the critters from "Monsters, Inc." or suburban Metroville, where the superheroic family in "The Incredibles" lives. The film opens at an enormous  speedway, where some dozen candy-colored race cars, including Lightning McQueen, are whooshing around a track as thousands upon thousands of similarly polychromic jalopies cheer, wave flags and do the wave.  Welcome to Weirdsville, Cartoonland, where automobiles race — and rule — in a world that, save for a thicket of tall pines and an occasional scrubby bush, is freakishly absent any organic matter. Here, even the bugs singeing their wings on the porch light look like itty-bitty Volkswagen beetles.  That sounds like a slap and a tickle, and for a while it's both. As written by Mr. Lasseter, who shares screenwriting credit with Dan Fogelman, Joe Ranft, Kiel Murray, Phil Lorin and (whew) Jorgen Klubien, the film hinges on a premise older than the 1951 Hudson Hornet named Doc (Paul Newman), who gives the story its requisite geezer wisdom. After taking a wrong turn on his way to a race, McQueen lands in Radiator Springs, a town that time and the freeway forgot. There, on a derelict lick of asphalt, he meets a pileup of metal and ethnic clichés, including a tow truck with a deep-fried accent (Larry the Cable Guy as Mater) and a lowrider   that apparently hopped in from East L.A. (Cheech Marin as Ramone).  This ethnic and cultural profiling is pretty much par for the animated film course, hence Jenifer Lewis, as a two-tone 1950's ride with big fins called Flo, provides the only identifiable "black" voice. Less wince-inducing are Luigi (Tony Shalhoub), a banana-yellow Italian-accented Fiat that runs the local tire store; Sarge (Paul Dooley), a World War II jeep as memorable and colorful as dung; and Fillmore (George Carlin), a VW bus who extols the virtues of organic fuel, mutters about conspiracies and raises the Stars and Stripes to the guitar squeals of Jimi Hendrix.  Given the film's regrettably retro attitude toward all things automotive (not a hybrid in sight!), it's no surprise that Fillmore, this desert outpost's most credible resident, is also its designated kook.  An animated fable about happy cars might have made sense before gas hit three bucks a gallon, but even an earlier sticker date couldn't shake the story's underlying creepiness, which comes down to the fact that there's nothing alive here: nada, zip. In this respect, the film can't help but bring to mind James Cameron's dystopic masterpiece, "The Terminator," which hinges on the violent war of the machine world on its human masters. To watch McQueen and the other cars motor along the film's highways and byways without running into or over a single creature is to realize that, in his cheerful way, Mr. Lasseter has done Mr. Cameron one better: instead of blowing the living world into smithereens, these machines have just gassed it with carbon monoxide.  Rendering plausible human forms remains one of 3D animation's biggest hurdles, something that Pixar directors like Andrew Stanton ("Finding Nemo") have readily admitted. As if realizing that they can't (yet) compete with nature, Pixar filmmakers tend to avoid the human form or create caricatures that, by virtue of their very exaggeration (think of the middle-age spread bedeviling Mr. Incredible's wife), are wonderfully lifelike.  With his machine world, however, Mr. Lasseter appears to have tried to do an end run around the vexing problem of the human body with cars that might as well have come out of a Chevron advertisement. Even stranger, the film turns Detroit's paving over of America into an occasion for some nostalgic historical revisionism. Surreal isn't the word.  Over the last two decades Pixar has invigorated American mainstream animation with charming stories and sterling technique, reaching a company best with the consecutively released "Monsters, Inc.," "Finding Nemo" and "The Incredibles." The age of Pixar may not be as golden as that of 1930's and 40's Disney, but it's an estimable run, especially since each new Pixar feature has reached deeper and higher in thematic and aesthetic preoccupations.  Like classic Disney, Pixar films are invariably traditionalist, with stories of familial and social retrenchment, but they're also witty and playful, fresh in both graphic and written line. One clunker won't shut down or even threaten the factory line, but here's hoping that as this onetime scrapper becomes increasingly entrenched and establishment, it keeps its geeks-and-freaks flag flying.  "Cars" is rated G (General audiences). Everything is clean but the fossil fuel.

With "Cars," Pixar's enviable streak of creative triumphs comes to a skidding stop. Despite representing another impressive technical achievement, it's the least visually interesting of the computer-animation boutique's movies, and -- in an ironic twist for a story about auto racing -- drifts slowly through its semi-arid midsection. Periodic bursts of cleverness brighten the festivities, but they're too few and far between, and the trademark humor that appeals to adults and kids often misfires. Pic should still possess plenty of G-rated horsepower commercially, but falls short of being the coming-out party Disney doubtless hoped for to showcase its Pixar acquisition.
John Lasseter, Pixar's leading creative force, is a self-proclaimed car enthusiast, and this marks his first directing effort since 1999's "Toy Story 2" -- preceded by "A Bug's Life" and the original Buzz-Woody team-up. (Joe Ranft, his co-director, died last year after completing work on the film.)
Yet passion for the project notwithstanding, Lasseter discovers there are only so many car puns he and five other credited writers can exhaust. And while adults might chuckle over pop-culture references to, say, funny-car "Jay Limo," both they and many kids will grow antsy after an introductory racing sequence.
That race introduces Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson), a brash racecar with a lone-wolf attitude. Lightning eschews hiring a crew chief, and his competition against the surly Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton) and veteran legend the King (racer Richard Petty) sets up a showdown in California a week hence. As a sign of his go-it-alone mentality, Lightning balks at trying to drum up enough friends to fill the 20 tickets allotted him.
Heading cross-country, Lightning inadvertently winds up marooned in the moribund Route 66 town of Radiator Springs, where his daredevil antics run afoul of the local judge, Doc Hudson (Paul Newman). As punishment, Lightning is forced to repave the town's decrepit road -- a task he pursues with reluctance, given his goal of reaching California to win the Piston Cup.
Bypassed by Interstate 40, Radiator Springs features the usual assortment of colorful characters, in an all-car cast that includes an attractive Porsche, Sally (Bonnie Hunt); the slightly addled tow truck Mater (Larry the Cable Guy); and a half-baked van that runs on "organic fuels," appropriately voiced by George Carlin. The question is how long it will take for Lightning to revive the town, while simultaneously learning the meaning of friendship.
Alas, "too long" is the answer, and barring the boisterous antics of blue-collar comic Larry, there's not much to make the time speed by. Granted, there are amusing sight gags involving the local bugs (in keeping with the automotive theme, Volkswagens with wings) and "tractor tipping," but like Lightning himself, the action simply keeps running out of gas.
Even Randy Newman's score isn't particularly distinguished, or too frequently gets drowned out by the sound of roaring tires. Nor will the racing sequences galvanize those who aren't NASCAR fans, despite an astounding display of computer-generated wizardry and detail -- from the car-filled stadiums down to the little grooves on the track.
Still, nothing here approaches the undersea wonder of "Finding Nemo," the childlike inspiration behind "Monsters Inc." or the excitement and sly wit of "The Incredibles" -- a high standard, admittedly, but the expectation bar against which all Pixar ventures inevitably will be judged.
Where "Cars" works best, frankly, might be in oiling the synergistic wheels of the Disney-Pixar marriage -- offering the enticing prospect of theme park tie-ins, battery-powered toys and other assorted merchandising.
Ultimately, however, those benefits are only maximized if the movie delivers, and while the inventive closing-credit animation should send patrons out smiling, that breezy detour arrives at the end of a dusty, near-two-hour ride.
Pixar's run of hits has been nothing short of amazing, rivaling Disney's early animated classics. Yet after assembling its version of the magnificent six, the company has settled for at best a so-so seventh.

Cars , the latest vehicle to roll off a Pixar  assembly line that has thus far yielded nothing but spit-shined classics, answers that age-old question: What would Doc Hollywood   have been like had it been populated entirely by, ya know, cars?
If the promise of that particular premisein which a hotshot (in this case, a hot rod) gets stranded in a small town on his way to Los Angeles and finds love among the ruins of what used to be paradisedoesn't exactly rev your engine, fret not. Cars  takes a little longer than most Pixar pics to get from zero to 60, and it does so in fits and starts and not without a little backfiring, but it eventually gets you where you want to gothe promised land of impulse-purchase trinkets and happy endings.
From this vantage point, it's hard to embrace a movie that casts yee-har-dee-harrin' Larry the Cable Guy  as a redneck tow truck one stiff breeze away from falling apart at the rusty seams; pandering, I think they call it. Yet it's also director John Lasseter 's most elegiac offering, an ode to the bygone days of dusty roads winding through small towns in which nothing ever happens except the crawling of time. That probably explains the turgid pace, with all the traction of a boxcar going uphill in molasses. The movie begs its audience to slow down and appreciate the roadside attractions passed at light speed from the freeway. Even the music, by Pixar stalwart Randy Newman , sounds like a 45 played at 42 rpm. Ironic that a movie about a race car named Lightning McQueen  (voiced by Owen Wilson , who sounds as though he's never in a hurry to get anywhere) would wind up the least frenetic of Pixar's offerings; compared to this, Finding Nemo  and A Bug's Life  positively vibrate.
Yet what ultimately redeems Cars  from turning out a total lemon is its soul. Lasseter loves these animated inanimate objects as though they were kin, and it shows in every beautifully rendered frame. And so the movie slowly grows on you, its familiarity be damned. It's just, well, a disappointment following the grown-up comic book that was The Incredibles , which (barely) concealed its emotions and maturity and profundity in superhero spandex. But do stay for the ending, which tricks up scenes from Pixar's previous outings and makes you miss them even more.
