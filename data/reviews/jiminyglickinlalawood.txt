         For three seasons on Comedy Central, Jiminy Glick, Martin Short's fat, obsequious, know-nothing celebrity interviewer, bombarded his guests with relentless salvos of inanity. A parody of the already ably self-parodying celebrity interview show genre, "Primetime Glick" allowed Short to sit opposite the likes of Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, Ben Stiller and Ellen DeGeneres and, careening between an intimate squeal and an authoritarian baritone, ask things no man not swathed in substantial padding would dare ask — whereupon he would grow instantly bored or annoyed with their answers and wind up upending entire bowls of snacks into his maw before tipping over his chair.
 
  As clueless, fawning, inappropriate and dumb as a Stone Phillips, Glick didn't lampoon one celebrity interviewer in particular. He rolled the squinty softball probing of Barbara Walters and Diane Sawyer, the self-satisfaction of Jay Leno, the rote weirdness of Larry King and the obsequiousness of James Lipton into one giant, sweaty mass of hysterical enthusiasm and deep disinterest — the jiggly embodiment of the scattered, voracious and lazy id of the celebrity news grazer before our eyes. (The slick, preening stars opposite him didn't fare much better, but they were almost beside the point.)
 


         






    A fan of the first season, I retain an inordinate fondness for the addlepated host, a fondness I realize is not shared by everyone. How you feel about Short's alter ego will probably determine how you feel about "Jiminy Glick in Lalawood," a giddy, gassy piece of lunatic fluff that recounts Jiminy's rise to fame. In interviews, Short has described Glick as a moron with power, and in "Jiminy Glick in Lalawood," he takes us back to the early days, when he was merely a moron.
 
  An obscure celebrity interviewer at a Butte, Mont., station, Jiminy is interviewing a local actress-perfume saleslady for the umpteenth time, shortly before heading off on his first trip to the Toronto Film Festival. On the trip, he's accompanied by his crazed, alcoholic wife, Dixie (Jan Hooks), and his beefy twin sons, Matthew (Landon Hansen) and Modine (Jake Hoffman), wondering aloud whether, as a journalist, it would be untoward of him to ask for autographs. When his reservation at the Fairmont turns out to be a reservation at the Fairmount
, a Lynchian fleabag with shades of the Overlook Hotel and Barton Fink's Los Angeles lodgings, Jiminy encounters the actual David Lynch (played by Short as well), who tells him he's working on a film about an obscure celebrity interviewer who becomes embroiled in a murder mystery.
 
  Produced by Short and Paul Brooks, and directed by Vadim Jean for under $10 million, "Jiminy Glick in Lalawood" milks the festival atmosphere for all it's worth, plopping Jiminy in the middle of what he desperately hopes will be his milieu. Stranded on the red carpet, desperately calling Kiefer Sutherland's name, the large man in owl glasses might as well be a cricket.
 
  Then, by luck, he falls asleep during his first screening and winds up giving a star-vehicle turkey its only good review. The star of "Growing Up Ghandi," a re-imagining of the life of the young Mahatma as a Sikh-pounding pugilist, is none other than the reclusive pretty-boy du jour, Ben diCarlo (Corey Pearson), who decides to grant Glick his first exclusive interview in five years. Overnight, Jiminy is propelled into the spotlight.
 
  Caught up in the insanity of instant celebrity and slipped a roofie, Jiminy wakes up the next day convinced he's murdered the alcoholic movie star Miranda Coolidge (Elizabeth Perkins). Something about the events of the night before — involving her insanely crass Eurotrash manager-producer husband, Andre Devine (John Michael Higgins), her press agent, Dee Dee (Janeane Garofalo), and her daughter, Natalie (Linda Cardellini) — echoes the true-life killing of Lana Turner's lover by her daughter.
 
  Improvised based on a 40-page plot outline co-written by Short, his brother Michael and Paul Flaherty, "Jiminy Glick in Lalawood" is funniest at its most tangential and unhinged. And Jiminy and Dixie embarking on a quest to discover whether he did or didn't dunnit is as good an excuse as any for Short and Hooks to lurk around the hotel, hiding behind curtains and taking cellphone calls. The movie spends more time on the mystery than on Jiminy's meat and glazed doughnuts, the celebrity interview, but Higgins' continental vulgarian is so inspired it makes the pointless story seem worthwhile. (Also featured are a couple of funny interviews with Short's friends Steve Martin and Kurt Russell, and cameos by Sharon Stone, Forest Whitaker — "the wonderful Forrest Gump" — and Sutherland.) For a movie this gleefully, unabashedly dumb, it's often quite clever. The novelty has worn off, but Jiminy's casual savagery and savage ignorance are still in fine form.

As the title character of Jiminy Glick in Lalawood , Martin Short is swathed in layers of body fat and leisure suit, with a ballooning double chin, and he flashes a crooked, V-shaped smile that lights up his face like an applause sign. That grin  phonier than Sammy Davis Jr.'s, even more passive-aggressive than Dick Cheney's  is Jiminy's way of ''connecting'' with whomever he's interviewing. A roly-poly entertainment reporter from Butte, Mont., Jiminy, his arteries clogged by infotainment, tosses questions at celebrities with an eager, lispy, weirdly prefab enthusiasm that makes him sound like a female impersonator who can't decide whether he wants to be Gloria Swanson or Leeza Gibbons. To say that stars validate Jiminy's existence wouldn't do justice to the psychotic scale of his obsession. More than a fan, he's a case of walking sublimation who lives for the moment when he can saunter up to Whoopi or Kevin Kline or introduce Forest Whitaker on the red carpet as ''the wonderful Forrest Gump!''
Jiminy worships celebrities but unconsciously hates the way that they fill up his existence, and that deep ambivalence  happy talk with hidden daggers  forms the core of Jiminy Glick in Lalawood . After years on Comedy Central, Jiminy may have finally earned his own movie, but I wish that it were less of a hit-or-miss affair than this one. Dispatched to the Toronto film festival, Jiminy, after dozing through a screening of Growing Up Gandhi , gives the film its only good review, thus landing an exclusive one-on-one with its director and star (Corey Pearson), a mishmash of Brad Pitt and Johnny Depp. Short also appears as David Lynch (yes, that David Lynch), who presides over a wispy-campy dream-and-reality nightmare plot. A haughty movie star, Miranda Coolidge (Elizabeth Perkins), has apparently been stabbed to death. Could it be Jiminy who did the deed? Bolstered by funny improv interviews with Steve Martin and Kurt Russell, Jiminy Glick in Lalawood  nevertheless belabors what Short did so nimbly on Comedy Central, which is to zero in on a star's weak spots under the guise that he's just funnin'. In his curdled-butterball way, Jiminy Glick may be the most acidic showbiz send-up since Andy Kaufman's Tony Clifton. This movie, though it has its moments, is a pedestal he didn't need.

iminy Glick in Lalawood," a frantic comic hodgepodge built around Martin Short's popular Comedy Central character, Jiminy Glick, is an intermittently funny free-for-all that tries desperately to flesh out a television sketch into a feature-length movie. Jiminy, whom Mr. Short introduced six years ago, is the most star-struck, grandiose and inept interviewer ever to apply his tongue to the sole of a celebrity shoe. Double-chinned and bewigged, quacking and waddling around in a fat suit, his eyes aglitter with salacious curiosity, Jiminy originated as a caricature of Skip E. Lowe, a real-life cable-access interviewer whose gushy interrogations of C- and D-list celebrities are phenomena unto themselves. Mr. Short is unable to improve on Mr. Lowe, but at least he has succeeded in lugging him bodily into the comedy mainstream as a parody. The movie yanks Jiminy out of his interviewer's chair and gives him a back story that doesn't really jibe with his flamingly effeminate persona. The Hollywood reporter for a television station in Butte, Mont., Jiminy has a roly-poly wife, Dixie (Jan Hooks), whose mind is addled by Thorazine, and idiotic twin sons (Matthew and Modine), who suggest a 21st-century Tweedledum and Tweedledee. This ramshackle comedy suggests three movies carelessly slapped together into a chaotic whole. In the funniest segments, Jiminy is his familiar ebullient self, springing into action as a hysterical bug-eyed interviewer grilling every celebrity who crosses his path at the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival, where some of the movie was made. Jiminy blithely confuses the real life Whoopi Goldberg with Oprah Winfrey and accosts Forest Whitaker, whom he hails as "the wonderful Forrest Gump." Longer, zany conversations are conducted in a studio with Kurt Russell and a twinkling Steve Martin. These sequences find Mr. Short and the actors near the top of their improvisatory form. The second (moderately funny) movie is a spoof of the Toronto Film Festival itself. We watch excerpts from "Growing Up Gandhi," an atrocious vanity project by a spoiled young filmmaker that immediately puts Jiminy to sleep. That doesn't prevent him from interviewing the sullen director (Corey Pearson) and heaping praise on a project every other critic has savaged. The third movie (a dud) is a satire of David Lynch films. Mr. Short, in full prosthetic makeup, impersonates Mr. Lynch, the director of "Mulholland Drive" and "Lost Highway," for a re-examination of the 1958 Lana Turner-Johnny Stompanato scandal, in a Lynchian spoof of an "Unsolved Mysteries" episode. Jiminy (like Mr. Lowe) is stuck in a late-50's scandal-mongering mind-set. After a drunken night on the town, he dreams he murdered Miranda Coolidge (Elizabeth Perkins), an alcoholic star visiting Toronto to promote her newest film, "The Queens of Africa," a lesbian-themed remake of "The African Queen." The dream is so vivid that Jiminy is convinced a murder might have been committed, and he becomes a bumbling sleuth tracking down the story. Directed by Vadim Jean, "Jiminy Glick in Lalawood" tries to twist its threads into a knot, but it unravels at every turn. The movie comes at you as a frenzied jangle of noise, activity and clever half-digested notions flung into the improvisatory stew pot. If the movie has intelligence to spare, it also suffers from attention-deficit disorder. "Jiminy Glick in Lalawood" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes abundant, harsh profanity.

Martin Short migrates his corpulent, eccentrically obnoxious celebrity interviewer from Comedy Central to the bigscreen in the swift, cheerfully shallow showbiz spoof "Jiminy Glick in Lalawood." Comic murder mystery is built around Short's by-now familiar journalism send-up -- here set against the real-life backdrop of the Toronto Film Festival. While stix won't exactly nix Glick pic, this is certainly the first mainstream laffer for which a working knowledge of David Lynch's oeuvre is a distinct asset. B.O. will depend on how many fans of the comic and character can be coerced from in front of the tube, with ancillary sure to benefit from name recognition.
The film's inspired wraparound device opens with, of all things, oddball helmer Lynch (Canadian-born Short, perfectly coifed and made up) pondering the notorious 1958 death of Johnny Stompanato in Lana Turner's mansion -- a clear nod to helmer's "Lost Highway."
Narrative then segues into Glick's backstory, which finds him hosting a local entertainment show in Butte, Mont. Wedging wife Trixie (Jan Hooks) and sons Matthew and Modine (Landon Hansen, Jake Hoffman) into the car, Glick starts out for Toronto where he hopes to click at the annual star-encrusted festival that's in full swing.
At first he's unable to land any celebrities for interviews and is reduced at one point to standing a few yards away from Kiefer Sutherland and yelling "Kiefer! Kiefer! Kiefer! Kiefer! Kiefer!" He then sleeps through the premiere screening of "Growing Up Gandhi," and over-compensates by giving spoiled young helmer Ben DiCarlo (Corey Pearson) a rave review.
On the strength of the grateful auteur's first interview in five years, Glick becomes an instant Hollywood player and embarks on a series of encounters with real-life stars Whoopi Goldberg, whom he thinks is Oprah Winfrey; Susan Sarandon ("I'd love to be your handler!" he shouts with glee); and Forest Whitaker, whom he calls "the wonderful Forrest Gump."
When he dreams of stabbing alcoholic actress Miranda Coolidge (Elizabeth Perkins) to death, Jiminy and Trixie stumble into a murder mystery that involves Miranda's Euro-trash husband Andre Devine (John Michael Higgins), her daughter Natalie (Linda Cardellini) and publicist Dee Dee (Janeane Garofalo).
Lynch obligingly returns at the end to tie up the Stompanato connection.
When it sticks to the festival and celebrity spoofery, the comedy maintains a frantic, surreal momentum, with spot-on satires of the festival ecosystem, a blizzard of caustic name-dropping and sly movie references. Miranda's in town to appear with "The Queens of Africa," a Sapphic remake of the John Huston film, while somebody wins an award for a movie called "Goyim Goyim Gone" and Toronto's best hip-hop nightclub is "Pimps and Hosers."
But the material with his obese family too often depends on salty, adolescent one-liners that provide shock value guffaws but grow cumulatively wearisome.
Though the large cast and improvisational nature of the approach results in noticeable narrative gaps, helmer Vadim Jean ("Leon the Pig Farmer") handles the multi-character shenanigans with brio. Nominal subplots get short shrift but feature in the denouement.
Short upstages himself as the spacey Lynch. Tolerance for the porcine Glick character remains an acquired taste, with his vocal gymnastics rivaling the sight of the actor in a fat suit.
Standing out from the crowd is Higgins, part of Christopher Guest's unofficial rep company, a hoot as the floridly foul-mouthed Andre. Pearson shows a talent for improv as the Depp-ish DiCarlo. MAD TV vets Mo Collins and Aries Spears lead the under-utilized secondary players as a timid publicist and clueless rapper. Of the star turns, studio-shot interviews with Steve Martin and Kurt Russell work best.
Tech credits are crisp, with make-up by Kristina Vogel and Judie Cooper-Sealy's wig work taking best in show. Red carpet footage was shot at 2002 edition of the Toronto fest, and pic was the closing night attraction of this year's event.

June 1 GARDEN STATE  (Zach Braff , 2004) Best-known for his role as a retarded quarterback, anhedonic actor-waiter Andrew "Large" Largeman (Zach Braff) comes home to New Jersey for his mom's funeral. Why hasn't he spoken to his folks in nine yearsand what's with all the mood stabilizers? Braff's triple threat has a patient way with information. The tragic backstory fills in gradually, and the slow reveal feels accurate rather than merely suspenseful. Then there are the goofier, permanent gaps: After an evening of detached debauchery, Large finds "BALLS" inexplicably Magic Markered on his forehead. PARK
June 8 BRIDGET JONES: THE EDGE OF REASON (Beeban Kidron, 2004)
June 15 SUPER SIZE ME  (Morgan Spurlock , 2004) Appetite suppressant, frat boy stunt, and anti-corporate head butt, Spurlock's self-starring documentary records the amusingly horrifying consequences of the director's 30-day McDonald's-only diet. The film, which exerts the gross-out fascination of reality TV's muckier specimens, has nothing new to say about America's fast-food addiction and obesity epidemic, but there's no denying its grotesque effectiveness as a work of public health advocacy. Fighting grease with grease, it's a film that has its severely taxed heart in the right place. LIM

July 27 THE AVIATOR (Martin Scorsese , 2004) Scorsese, our foremost moviemaking cinephile, cannonballs into old Hollywood  to tell the story of one Howard Hughes , billionaire, briber, star fucker, plane crasher, occasional movie producer, and all-around neurotic shit storm. Gigantic, blustery, and stuffed with cameoed details (Cate Blanchett 's riff on Katharine Hepburn  makes her the dead legend's avatar), it's a biopic paradigmand an American-dream-gone-rancid tale bidding to complement Raging Bull .

August 3 FINDING NEVERLAND  (Marc Forster , 2004) Johnny Depp  gives an unusually subdued performance as J.M. Barrie , who in befriending a young widow (Kate Winslet ) and her four sons, received the inspiration for his 1905 play Peter Pan  . Inhabiting a green, empty England in endless Edwardian summer, Marc Forster's first film since Monster's Ball  raises all manner of red flags with its surfeit of loaded themesbeatifying illness, bereft children, escapist fantasy, the enshrining of boyhoodbut overall practices a tasteful restraint.

The Big Lebowski intermittently references The Big Sleep  but this wacky series of L.A. adventures featuring a stoned slacker as a surrogate Philip Marlowe  is pure pop ruminationso relaxed as to be nearly free-associative.

August 24 DAZED AND CONFUSED  (Richard Linklater , 1993) No less structuralist than Slacker expressing a fierce muddle of memories rather than a rambling paranoiathis mini-masterpiece about 1970s Texas high school kids inhabiting their self-defined universe is one of the most rewatchable films of its decade, capturing its time and place with anthropological care.

An unstoppable good-mood generator, this resolutely 2-D vehicle has more yuks than Shark Tale  and enough soul to swallow The Polar Express  whole. It's a kids' movie that deigns to understand what kids want to seehysterical amplifications of kid-like behavior and the making fun of oldsters, rather than the pop-cult winking and cruddy nostalgia that said oldsters presumably favor. To wit: When King Neptune (Jeffrey Tambor ) discloses his shiny pate, onlookers shriek, "Bald! Bald!" and "My eyes!" PARK
