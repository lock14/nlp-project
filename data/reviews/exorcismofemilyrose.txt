Certain very good actors have an excellent eye for trash. Laura Linney might have 20/20 vision, based on her parts in "Congo," "The Mothman Prophecies," and, most outrageously, "The Life of David Gale," in which she played a homely yet extreme political activist. The fun of these movies is that Linney often seems too refined for such greasy junk, but there she is anyway, hamming it down as it were.
Linney is more or less the star of "The Exorcism of Emily Rose," a perfectly sorry excuse for a horror film that casts her as Erin Bruner, an uptight, top-flight lawyer who's defending a priest (Tom Wilkinson) accused of killing a young woman (Jennifer Carpenter) in a bid to rid her of unholiness.
Most of the movie is set in a courtroom, so Linney has very little to do with the tasteless flashbacks to Emily's affliction. But the movie is a tale of double possession. Erin is crazed about her career. Yes, this is one of those movies about a woman whose only ambition is making partner. She goes to bed alone, in a sterile home, has no friends, and eats, sleeps, and breathes her case, which plays like an extra devilish episode of "Law & Order."
The archdiocese specifically requested Erin to defend Wilkinson's Father Moore. She recently got an accused murderer acquitted, and her star is on the rise. But the Catholics don't know -- she's agnostic. In a sense, this is ideal for her line of defense: I can't prove Emily was possessed, but, hey, I can't prove she wasn't.
Of course the movie, which claims to be based on a true story, seems to believe she was. We see poor Emily, a recent college freshman from a rural town, pinned back in her bed, an invisible force atop her body, strangling her. She flips out in class, much the way the teen paranoids did in those "Nightmare on Elm Street" films, and runs across campus shrieking in the rain in a nightgown. She sees ghoulish faces on her classmates, and hears heavy breathing. She eats bugs, speaks in tongues, and contorts her body into a satanic yoga pose best described as downward demon. Look for the Emily Rose training regimen at your local Healthworks.
The district attorney -- a starchy Campbell Scott, in what appears to be a stunt mustache -- claims Emily was suffering from a psychotic bout with epilepsy. She died of malnutrition and nasty physical trauma, he says. As a rebuttal, Erin later calls to the stand an expert in the "science of possession" who is played by the regal Oscar nominee Shohreh Aghdashloo. The actress answers a few questions and then is free to cash her check.
Scott Derrickson directed and, with Paul Harris Boardman, wrote "The Exorcism of Emily Rose." He and Boardman also wrote the cheeky 2000 sequel to the teen slasher flick "Urban Legends." The horror impulse that grips the filmmaking -- full moons, "gotcha" editing, pigeons that act like bats, things going bump in the night -- is mostly just cheap tricks.
"There are dark forces surrounding this trial," Father Moore tells Erin. "Demons exist whether you believe in them or not." But the movie never makes good on his promise.
The material cries out for the craftsmanship of "The Exorcist," which this movie is desperate to evoke. Linney has never looked foxier, and she uses good diction and her Ivy League carriage as weapons against some of the more laughable scenes. (See her face after a car hits her star witness!)
The preposterousness of the trial, which is never lost on Scott's lawyer, has its pleasures, too. At one point, Scott objects to a line of questioning. "On what grounds?" asks the judge. "Silliness."


         The forces of good and evil wage a holier than thou battle for our attention in the hybrid thriller "The Exorcism of Emily Rose." Inserting a dose of horror into a standard courtroom drama, writer-director Scott Derrickson and co-writer Paul Harris Boardman have constructed a well-cast yet dopey tale that is much less than the sum of its parts. It's certainly creepy, but not always in ways the filmmakers intended.
 
  Laura Linney stars as Erin Bruner, a high-profile defense attorney hired by a Catholic archdiocese to defend Father Moore (Tom Wikinson), a priest accused of negligent homicide. The church, understandably not wanting to appear medieval, would prefer to make the case go away by having Moore plead out to the charge that the exorcism he performed on 19-year-old Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter) led to the college freshman's death.
 


         






    Going against the wishes of the archdiocese and her boss (Colm Feore), however, Bruner not only takes the case to trial but allows Moore to testify. The priest's passionate desire to tell Emily's story and a malfunctioning alarm clock are about all it takes to convince the attorney, an avowed agnostic, that it's a case worth the risk to her career.
 
  The audience witnesses the exorcism through the testimonies of Moore, Emily's father (Andrew Wheeler) and her college friend, Jason (Joshua Close). The flashbacks show to good effect the work of production designer David Brisbin, whose chilled to the bone landscape and sparse farmhouse are the setting for Emily's exorcism, and the frosty cinematography of Tom Stern.
 
  Derrickson acknowledges a fondness for Kurosawa, "Rashomon" in particular, but rather than giving conflicting accounts of Emily's ordeal, the flashbacks all mesh. Carpenter gamely contorts her voice and body to convey the demonic possession (or is it epilepsy compounded by psychosis, as Campbell Scott's prosecutor argues?), but the film's frights come mainly through shock cuts and sound amplification (muted to PG-13-acceptable levels).
 
  Any suspense built through the exorcism exits the movie whenever the action shifts back to the courtroom. It does not help the audience suspend disbelief to have Scott's Ethan Thomas, a churchgoing but highly rational Methodist, provide plausible scientific and medical explanations at every turn. It's the equivalent of a Superman movie continually calling attention to the fact that the Man of Steel can't actually fly. When Thomas objects to one of Bruner's witnesses on the grounds of silliness, you will have to stifle the urge to second the motion.
 
  The film is also a victim of its own structure in the sense that there is no mystery to the narrative. The final rendering of the jury's verdict is anticlimactic to what's come before — not that there's anything terribly dramatic in the buildup. It's just that there's no question concerning Emily's fate, and the way the filmmakers spin the story, it all comes down to embracing superstition by doubting reason. That Bruner is so easily swayed makes you wonder how she became an attorney in the first place. Audience sympathy will fall squarely on one side of the courtroom or the other based on their preexisting beliefs, and nothing in the film will change that.

I have little problem believing that there are people in this world who become possessed by evil spirits. I have a larger problem believing that the only movie those evil spirits have ever seen at the hellplex is The Exorcist . If the devil and his minions are so devilishly clever, why don't they express themselves in more nefariously unexceptional ways, blending in with the neighborhood to wreak havoc?
The devil is strictly Linda Blair-era old school in The Exorcism of Emily Rose , an intelligent inquiry into the limitations of belief and faith as a defense in a court of law woo-wooed up with a heaping of religious-girl-gone-mad conniption fits. Part Law & Order , part The Omen , the movie doesn't trust the audience to follow serious theological and legal discussion without a spook hook.
The story is, as they say in the Church of Movie Coming Attractions, inspired by real events (the case on which it's based took place in 1978). Emily (Jennifer Carpenter, a champion shrieker), the tormented young woman of the title, leaves her family in Rural Devout, USA, goes off to Godless University, and becomes infested, one dark dorm night of the soul, by demons. She can't sleep. She looks into the eyes of her classmates and sees blood and ghouls. Eventually, her torment drives her to drop out and return home, where she is first diagnosed as epileptic, and then as psychotic. By the time Father Richard Moore (Tom Wilkinson, reliable player of responsible men) sees her, she is a ravaged soul in need of a full exorcism.
The approach fails. The girl dies. And Father Moore is charged with negligent homicide, represented at his trial by Erin Bruner (Laura Linney), an atheist tough cookie in a power pantsuit. The prosecution argues that Emily died because her priest ignored her medical condition.  The defense contends  well, Erin doesn't know what to contend. To explain her shift from secular doubt to a newborn faith in her client's veracity, director Scott Derrickson and writing collaborator Paul Harris Boardman put the attorney through her own mild attack of spiritual demons. Linney doesn't have to shriek and vomit, but her character does see strange doings (Lucifer loves breaking things in kitchens). Unfortunately, by the time she comes to believe in the power of belief, my eyes had rolled back in my head.

 "The Exorcism of Emily Rose," directed by Scott Derrickson from a script he wrote with Paul Harris Boardman, is a horror movie wrapped in a courtroom drama. A priest (Tom Wilkinson) is accused of negligent homicide because a young woman in his care has died after a failed exorcism. For the defense, we have Laura Linney, whose character, Erin Bruner, is an ambitious lawyer with somewhat better taste in liquor than in courtroom attire. For the prosecution, with gray at his temples and a neat little mustache riding his lip, there is Campbell Scott, whose character's steely patience eventually wears thin. "Your honor, I object," he exclaims, as every good courtroom-drama lawyer must. On what grounds? "Well, silliness, for one."  Sustained. But objecting to silliness in a horror movie is a bit unfair. The whole point of the genre - the fun as well as the terror - lies in the suspension of disbelief. "The Exorcism of Emily Rose," however, goes a bit further. Announcing from the start that it is "based on a true story" (words guaranteed to scare most movie critics), it tries to nudge its audience toward a real-world condition of belief in the supernatural doings it depicts.  Though Mr. Derrickson deploys the usual techniques of scary-movie making with a reasonable degree of competence, he does so for unusually high stakes. This is not meant to be just another spooky story, but rather a matter of (eternal) life and death, a religious argument decked out with dark and stormy nights, yowling cats and low-rent creep show effects.  The tale is fairly simple, and curiously lacking in suspense. We know from the start that Emily (Jennifer Carpenter), a devout 19-year-old who grew up in a rattling clapboard house in the middle of an empty field, is dead. The details of her last months are filled in by Father Moore (Mr. Wilkinson), who is either haunted by what he has seen or else suffering from chronic gas pain.  Mr. Wilkinson, usually a strong and subtle actor, here gives us no clue as to Father Moore's state of mind. Ms. Carpenter's Emily is a blank slate scribbled upon by diabolical forces. Though she flails and howls gamely, she is no Linda Blair. Her head does not spin, nor does she vomit green bile. Still, she does perform some extreme yoga poses, eats a handful of bugs and caterwauls in several languages, helpfully subtitled.  This leaves Ms. Linney to bear the burden of the drama, which she does with characteristic grace. Erin pronounces herself an agnostic, but stopped clocks and other ominous portents push her from skepticism toward acceptance of her client's view. Father Moore insists that Emily was in the grip of the Devil's minions, even as the prosecution presents an array of expert witnesses arguing that she suffered from a medical rather than a spiritual condition. Erin, in turn, unearths an anthropologist (Shohreh Aghdashloo) who studies demonic possession and is studiously noncommital as to whether it really exists.  The movie pretends to take the same tolerant, anything's-possible position. While not especially good - judged strictly on its cinematic merits, it ranges from O.K. to god-awful - it is still a fascinating cultural document in the age of intelligent design. Its point of view suggests an improbable alliance of postmodern relativism and absolute religious faith against the supposed tyranny of scientific empiricism, which is depicted as narrow and dogmatic.  The sincerity of a believer - Father Moore, in this case - is conflated with the plausibility of his beliefs. The doctors, meanwhile, seem so sure of themselves. But of course, the movie says, no one can ever be completely sure, and thus superstition becomes a matter of reasonable doubt. Meanwhile the clocks stop, the wind howls, and we are encouraged to believe - or at least not to disbelieve - our own eyes. Father Moore knows what he saw. So do I: propaganda disguised as entertainment.  "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some harrowing scenes of demonic possession.

Some genuine shocks punctuate "The Exorcism of Emily Rose," an unusually intelligent genre item that manages to mix full-bore horror with courtroom drama. Anchored by a compelling performance from Laura Linney as an agnostic lawyer who takes on the defense of a Catholic priest accused of negligent homicide during an exorcism, pic may prove too talky and CGI-light to scare up devilish returns in today's mass market. But given the right chance, it could score with upscale genre fans of both sexes, especially overseas.
All clipped sentences and soignee power-dressing, Linney plays Erin Bruner, junior partner at a law firm run by Karl Gunderson (Colm Feore). Ambitious Erin is a rising star after getting a high-profile murderer off the hook; when Karl asks her take on the case of Father Richard Moore (Brit actor Tom Wilkinson), she accepts with the proviso that she'll make senior partner if she wins.
Meanwhile, to protect itself from possible accusations of antireligious bias, the district attorney's office has decided to field assistant D.A. Ethan Thomas (Campbell Scott), a buttoned-up, devout churchgoer.
Based on a true story, nicely lean screenplay by Paul Harris Boardman and helmer Scott Derrickson packs everything the audience needs to know into the opening reel or so, including the first of many flashbacks to the titular victim, Emily Rose (Jennifer Carpenter). Erin refuses any plea bargaining, as the padre wishes to tell the full story of Emily and her exorcism in court.
At the 15-minute mark, the trial begins, and, in the film's most original structural gambit, for the following 100 minutes pic intercuts courtroom proceedings with flashbacks to Emily's story as it's revealed by witness testimony. Pic thus works on two concurrent levels: The debate between science and faith (and its effect, especially, on nonbeliever Erin) is played out in the trial sequences and brief noncourtroom interludes, while the flashbacks supply the horror in increasingly ramped-up style.
Story emerges of an average 19-year-old from the sticks who wins a college scholarship and soon finds herself "possessed" by some dark force that bends her out of shape at 3 in the morning (the traditional witching hour of evil). The scientists put Emily's condition down to "psychotic-epileptic disorder" and prescribe a calming drug.
After fleeing one night to a church, Emily comes under the sway of Father Richard, who believes -- and convinces Emily -- that the problem is spiritual, not physical. With her family's consent, Father Richard finally performs an official Catholic exorcism that pushes her weakened body too far.
As the trial continues, Erin herself starts falling prey to nighttime scares. As her agnosticism starts to crumble, she constructs a defense argument that hinges on spiritual possession being accepted as a valid phenomenon in Western society.
Derrickson ("Hellraiser V: Inferno," "Ghosting") handles the courtroom scenes in a straightforward manner that would make Perry Mason feel at home, with the usual minor dramas over, for example, finding an expert witness in time.
It's all generic stuff, though the dialogue is well handled by the cast and the arguments are laid out in an accessible way. (Sometimes too accessibly, with Erin repeatedly saying, "By that, you mean...") It's the juxtaposition of that part of the screenplay with the horror material that gives pic its special tension and flavor.
Most notably, Derrickson & Co. don't resort to the expected CGI bonanza: Virtually all the horror comes from plain, old-fashioned special effects, lighting, color design and performances, especially by Carpenter, who's utterly believable in her moments of ugly possession. Deafening score by Christopher Young would become tiresome if used all the way through the picture but complements the all-out horror flashbacks.
Screenplay's avoidance of unnecessary character backgrounding, touchy-feely downtime with family and friends and explanations for every event gives pic a tight, trim feel, even at two hours. In those respects, the film has more in common with Asian horror movies than with regular U.S. genre fare. Exorcism scene, when it finally arrives, is genuinely powerful.
Apart from one wobbly scene in which Erin confesses to Father Richard that her lack of faith is starting to weaken, Linney carries the picture, making the most of an essentially routine role, especially in her fine concluding speech.
Scott makes Ethan a tough, humorless opponent, and Wilkinson , despite a fluctuating Yank accent, plays the priest to the hilt, with him and Linney pairing well. Smaller roles are professionally filled, with even an actress of Mary Beth Hurt's caliber cast in the hardly demanding role of the court judge.
Tech package, especially Tom Stern's widescreen lensing, is smooth in all departments. Film was shot in Vancouver.

Apparently, exorcism horror movies lose a good deal of footing unless they're "based on a true story"and authentication is hard to come by. Wildly extrapolated from the case of a German teenager in the 1970s, The Exorcism of Emily Rose   is grave business, attempting to address Kantian issues of reason and doubt in a courtroom dynamic, and unsurprisingly scoring with cheap shots on the side of the holy-rollin' faithful. Possession thrillers are natural billboards for Mel Gibson style Catholicism, but the new film, which prosecutes a priest (Tom Wilkinson ) for his "negligent" role in a college girl's gone-wild self-abuse and eventual death, has a distinctly Bush-era, end-times vibe.
Fools will take it semi-seriously, but more importantly, first-time director Scott Derrickson  knows how to cut ghoul-faced shock shots, and the film's wintry palette is effective. The screenplay, in which contemporary characters use phrases like "forces of darkness!" is another type of spoor altogether. (M. Night Shyamalan  could've squeezed it out after a chili dinner.) Laura Linney , playing the worldly heroine-lawyer slowly awakening to the almighty powers of heaven and hell, is deadly earnest; the go-to girl for filmmakers requiring a book-smart but ultimately clueless attorney in a skirt, Linney seems here as resolutely on the edge of self-parody as she was in Congo . Ultimately a rationale for suffering martyrdom not unlike the Linney vehicle The Life of David Gale  , Derrickson's flick can sour your stomach with piety, which is a shameits moments of jolt wattage rate with many J-horrors. If you can manage a dozen or more piss breaks during the ecumenical wrangling, you'll come out ahead.
