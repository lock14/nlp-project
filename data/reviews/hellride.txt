The line between homage and parody is blurry enough at the best of times in our post-Pulp Fiction
 world, but Hell Ride
 � a grindhousey biker flick executive-produced by Quentin Tarantino and starring Madsen's ongoing impersonation of a hung-over Nick Nolte on a good-hair day � pretty much fucks the distinction over. Should we be chuckling at Bishop-the-screenwriter's genuine gift for beautiful bullshit, as in the scene where Bishop-the-actor trades ever-escalating and seedily incendiary euphemisms with a perpetually horny cyclista? Or is he, you know, being serious? It's impossible to tell one way or the other, and it happens often enough that you get the urge to say to hell with the whole ride, mystical peyote journeys, naked Suicide Girl wannabes, and crazed displays of overly art-directed violence. But you don't say it because of all of the above and less. It's like watching a valentine from Tarantino's bestest friend in the whole world go directly from heart to heart, and while it references everything from the classic American International Pictures biker outings to Mad Max
 and beyond, this convoluted, overly snazzy-looking tale of bad blood between worse people is only as interesting as Madsen's squint 'n' gravel countenance. (The former Mr. Blonde plays a character nicknamed "the Gent," which gives you some idea of the company he keeps.) Genuine iconoclast Hopper, looking like ill-kept saddlery, appears briefly and gets his ropers pissed on, as does Carradine, Tarantino's ex-Bill. Despite the brevity of their roles, the pair of them outshines everything in sight, including Madsen's reptile grin. The story is a shambles, incoherent throughout, veined with tirelessly wearying flashbacks, hallucinations, and just plain old lousy storytelling. It's a fiasco, really, but who knows � it might be a blast on mushrooms. This being Austin, go find out, and report back if you're so inclined. Me, I've got a new DVD of The Wild Angels
 to dive into.


Is it possible to get a second-degree sunburn looking at people with tight, pickled skin? I get this way watching "The Hills" and "Growing Up Gotti" on TV. But "Hell Ride" is something else altogether. It's a self-amused, self-conscious, seriously limp throwback to motorcycle westerns of the 1970s, set on the arid highways of the American Southwest. The writer and director, Larry Bishop, pulls in close on the actors' skin to an alarming degree. You can see the variegated patches that overexposure can cause.
These don't look like spray-on tans. They look accidental, like the cast got wasted one night and woke up in the desert. The movie has a kind of authenticity that way. Everybody seems hung over and one scene away from fatal sunstroke. No one gets more close-ups than Bishop himself. (OK, an assortment of ladies' bobbling breasts and buttocks do.) He plays - well, I'm not sure what he's playing. A dude on a bike? But he looks rightly filthy and seems too old for this movie. The primary interests of his character, Pistolero, consist of beautiful, bodacious women and the would-be lascivious things they can say to him.
Bishop is the son of Joey Bishop, the Rat Pack's comic relief, but when forced to look into his large dark eyes, stare at his impossibly black hair, and hear his gruff voice utter gratuitous profanity, you think about a counterfeit version of the Ian McShane of "Deadwood."
This movie is his second as a director, after "Mad Dog Time," his Richard Dreyfuss gangster film from 1996, which I remember more for Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert's exasperated pan on their show. In the intervening years, Bishop has befriended Quentin Tarantino, who, treating him like the kitsch he loves to collect, cast him in "Kill Bill." Tarantino's name is stamped on the new movie's credits as a producer. The whole thing feels like the sort of picture Tarantino would make if he weren't such an ingenious B-movie artist: a genre exercise that's more studious than entertaining. "Hell Ride" is slavish as homage and not terribly interesting as moviemaking. It works better if you think of it as 83 minutes inside a tannery.
The plot pits Pistolero and his two bike buddies - Eric Balfour and Michael Madsen, a Tarantino regular - against a pretty good Vinnie Jones and whoever else was responsible for murdering an old friend of the gang. Madsen wears a ruffled tuxedo shirt that, in every scene, makes him look like the best man sneaking out of a bridesmaid's motel room in 1977. I don't think the character would pass a breathalyzer test. David Carradine and Dennis Hopper are here, too, because omitting them would be like throwing a beach party and not inviting Frankie and Annette.
It seems as if Bishop spent years looking for someplace to put his favorite banter, his favorite scene from Hopper's "Easy Rider" (the acid trip), and his favorite strippers. "Hell Ride" is a monument to all of it, not to mention an occasion for Bishop to realize a wish to be Serge Gainsbourg - well, sort of realize, since there's more throat-cutting than love-making. Really, the movie seems to exist to flatter Tarantino. All the bikers have nicknames - Comanche, the Gent, Opium - à la Mr. White and Mr. Pink, and the violence strains mightily to evoke the sadism in a Tarantino film. It's "Reservoir Hogs."


 “Hell Ride,” a silly slice of genre gone bad, takes place in an American desert populated by middle-aged bikers and the nubile, often topless young women who love them. The guys, who have names like Pistolero and the Gent (he wears a tuxedo, see), ride around brawling and posturing and pretending they’re in better movies.  A jumble of influences, “Hell Ride” borrows its jump-around-in-time structure and absurdist wordplay from Quentin Tarantino (who apparently doesn’t hold a grudge; he’s credited as executive producer) and its sense of empty spaces and hovering doom from Sergio Leone. All that’s missing is those directors’ talent.  The quadruple threat responsible for “Hell Ride,” Larry Bishop — writer, director, producer and actor (he plays Pistolero) — kicked around B-movies in the 1960s and ’70s, making his mark as an actor in biker pictures, which he obviously loves. But he burdens his film with clumsy art-house ambitions that clash with its embrace of bikes, beer and booty. If any of this sounds amusing, be warned: it’s not. It’s depressingly self-conscious and turgid, and a cast that includes Dennis Hopper, David Carradine, Michael Madsen and Eric Balfour can’t drag “Hell Ride” out of the mire.  “Hell Ride” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for nudity, profanity and only-in-Pistolero’s-dreams sexual situations.

Quentin Tarantino asked Larry Bishop to create a biker movie like the ones the latter had acted in nearly 40 years ago. The resulting slavish dead-genre tribute, "Hell Ride," is perhaps most uncanny in reproducing the boredom most of its original inspirations exuded. This substance-free exercise in retro-cool 'tude will lure some of those buffs and hipsters who ponied up for the far more enjoyable "Grindhouse," but that won't prevent quick B.O. wipeout. OK ancillary returns should follow.
On a drive-in screen circa 1972, with beer, weed and necking to distract from the tedious dialogue, this could have been hazily perceived as a trangressive good time. Robbed of such external ambience, however, one faces the facts: There's precious little action in "Hell Ride," even less plot, and a whole lot of tougher-than-thou posturing from aging thesps who really don't benefit from coasting on their bad-boy iconic stature.
Bishop's feature comes off less as a third giddy "Grindhouse" panel than as an homage to "Kill Bill Vol. 2's" most ploddingly quasi-mythic passages, as well as many, many dull biker pics (as opposed to those few memorable ones, including such vigorous obscurities as "Satan's Sadists" and "She Devils on Wheels").
Bishop himself -- who stole several such vintage chestnuts, notably "Angel Unchained" and Richard Rush's above-average "The Savage Seven" -- plays Pistolero, president of the Victors. Thirty-two years ago, Pistolero's Native American honey Cherokee (Julia Jones) was beaten, stabbed and burned alive by a rival gang over purloined drug-trade money. Now those 666ers are back, announcing their re-entrance by meting out identical death to one lesser Victor.
It isn't long before veteran bad hombres the Deuce (David Carradine) and Billy Wings (Vinnie Jones) show up, eager to find keys unlocking a hidden safe deposit box presumably containing major loot. Pistolero, wiseguy the Gent (Michael Madsen) and lanky, testy Sonny, aka Comanche (Eric Balfour) -- perhaps Cherokee's lost only child -- battle back, with an occasional assist from the long-presumed-dead Eddie Zero (Dennis Hopper).
All this sounds like a surefire recipe for knowing, trashy fun, but something got burnt in the oven.
Myriad killings, a few fights and fewer motorcycle stunts (most happening to characters too undefined for their fates to matter) are listlessly staged. When characters aren't riding or glowering at each other at gunpoint, they're chasing and getting the "third B" (after bikes and beer, booty) -- this being the kind of fantasy universe in which old guys are surrounded by under-25 silicone-enhanced stripper types who beg for it all the time.
Screenplay's acres of pseudo-hip tough-speak run the gamut from groaningly unfunny ("If our beer doesn't kill you, it'll sure make you piss stronger!") to groaningly portentous ("Hell's gonna get a helluva lot worse from now on!"). Another buzzkill is the running white-guy appropriation of all things superficially "Indian" as badge of ultimate coolness.
Thesps (even toplining helmer, who's a strapping 60 years old) have nothing to work with, though one hopes they had fun riding about the desert. Prior scenarist of two quirky, little-seen 1996 features (Denis Leary vehicle "Underworld" and cameo-studded "Mad Dog Time," which he also directed), Bishop assembles a good-looking and sounding package. Too bad there's so little inside.
Sure to outride "Hell" is its soundtrack. Between Daniele Luppi's delightful original score and various old/new artist cuts (by Les Baxter, Mitch Ryder, Roberto Rodriguez, etc.), it wittily encompasses '60s/'70s genre sounds from acid rock to spaghetti Western to lounge schlock and more.

In the post–Pulp Fiction  '90s, one could throw a rock at random and hit a two-bit Quentin Tarantino  knock-off—all chatty gangsters with showy monikers doing the slo-mo "let's go to work" swagger. Now, with this hyper-sexualized, spaghetti-westernized, vulgar homage to the cheapie biker movies he starred in as an AIP contract player decades ago, actor turned filmmaker Larry Bishop  (Mad Dog Time ) updates the useless Tarantino derivation for the post-Grindhouse  '00s. Adding two-tone credits, sun-bleached retro camerawork, and a Morricone-goes-rockabilly score to the chatty, showy swagger, Bishop trudges through a perfunctory premise about familial revenge and rival gangs. Street cred can't save this pic, not even with Dennis Hopper  and David Carradine  cameos, and QT himself exec-producing and initiating the project. Bishop's jumbled, wholly unexciting throwback has very little on its mind beyond mythologizing its maker as a bad-ass biker named Pistolero. When he's not leading the pack in far too many desert-road montages, trippin' on peyote, or spouting Zen-stupid puns, Bishop lives out fantasies of fucking his frequently full-frontal female cast, most of whom look like FHM  sexbots. (Villainous Vinnie Jones  shows up sporting a crossbow and tattoos based on the types of pussy he's eaten: menstrual, crab-infested, or dead—yes, it's that kind of movie.) Maybe if we were given our own pleasures to indulge in, we'd be able to handle the boys getting theirs.
