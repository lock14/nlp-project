 Jacques Nolot’s film “Before I Forget” begins with the image of a blank screen with a small dot at the center that slowly expands into a round black hole, a stark image of the void that looms more prominently as we age.  But for Pierre (Mr. Nolot), the film’s 60-year-old protagonist, who lives alone in a modest Paris apartment, the near future is more ominous than for most. Pierre, H.I.V. positive for 24 years, has been advised to take a more aggressive drug cocktail than the medication that has sustained him. He is reluctant because of its toxic side effects, including hair loss. His body may be dilapidated, but his face is still handsome in a hawklike way, and crowned by an elegant gray mane.  With its shots of Pierre, naked,  in the throes of simulated sex, “Before I Forget” is an unblinking portrait of a complicated, solitary gay man who has outlived his working years. A male escort who for decades was kept by a lion of French society 15 years his senior who has just died, Pierre is reduced to paying rent boys for sex, an activity he pursues assiduously even though he doesn’t appear to enjoy it very much.  Sex for pay has been the theme of his life since his late teens, and now the roles are reversed; it is his turn to purchase the kind of ritualized domination found in Jean Genet novels. You sense that he seeks to be punished by versions of his younger self. It doesn’t seem to have occurred to Pierre that there is any other kind of erotic transaction worth pursuing.  “Before I Forget” is the third semi-autobiographical film in a trilogy by Mr. Nolot, a French actor, writer and director closely associated with André Téchiné. This movie follows Pierre around Paris as he visits acquaintances in his circle of johns and hustlers, has sessions with an obtuse psychiatrist and remembers how the family of his longtime sugar daddy closed ranks and shut Pierre out of his inheritance.  It forces us to glean what biographical information we can from details mentioned in conversation. If the closeted way of life the movie describes seems quaint in the age of gay liberation, the human nature it portrays has no shelf life. When you reach a certain age, it emphasizes, money becomes paramount.  Although Pierre, who is writing a memoir, declares more than once that he has contemplated suicide, he doesn’t seem especially unhappy. Even on the erotic front hope springs eternal. He and his friend Georges (Jean Pommier), a married, closeted lawyer, cheerfully compare the costs of hustlers. When the talk isn’t about the price of flesh, it is gossip about estates, how to protect undeclared income, smuggle money across borders and finagle financial security. Because of his bravado and power games with his older lover, we discover, Pierre lost out on his inheritance.  Mr. Nolot’s fictionalized self-portrait is proudly self-lacerating. While Pierre maintains an attitude of haughty independence, Mr. Nolot goes out of his way to puncture any illusions he may have of being desirable to the boys he covets. As the camera studies Pierre from a distance in his dimly lighted apartment and slowly surveys the possessions on his shelves, you sense a man who has accepted the choices he has made.  The picture of Pierre as a tough old bird is reinforced when Marc (Bastien d’Asnières), his regular rent boy, insists on dressing him in drag and taking him to the Pigalle district. He initially refuses. He would have to shave off his mustache, he protests. But he changes his mind.  Outfitted as a female streetwalker, a whole new personality emerges. With his sharp features, vigilant, birdlike gaze, his feet planted in a doorway, the drag version of Pierre is a hardened whore decades past her prime but still defiantly pounding the pavement.

A former gigolo who has been HIV-positive for 24 years navigates a slew of physical and emotional obstacles with mordant aplomb in "Before I Forget." Third installment in scripter-helmer-star Jacques Nolot's trilogy on the pragmatic side of gay life finds the straight-shooting poet of matter-of-fact sexual transactions in fine narrative form, exhibiting his aging body and mindset without a trace of vanity. If you've pondered how to order a round of fellatio as one orders a pizza or wondered what gay gentlemen of a certain age talk about, this touching glimpse of faded beauty and looming decrepitude fits the bill.
Made for a mere E400,000 with a predominantly non-pro cast, pic follows the daily and nightly activities of Pierre (Nolot), whose sleep is tormented by aches and vomiting and whose future is a little bleaker in light of the death of the man who more or less supported him for three decades.
Pierre meets for drinks or meals with other men in his loose circle, one of whom has just inherited a vast fortune in art and property from his patron. Another spends a fortune on male prostitutes. Pierre, 58, doesn't get the same kick out of verbal abuse he apparently used to but still enjoys fellating younger flesh for a fee.
Proceedings would be risible and sordid in less-refined hands, but Nolot has a knack, often via nicely handled incongruity, for finding the human comedy in awkward situations. His technique for getting out of a traffic citation is almost certainly a cinematic first.
Lensing's distinctive Parisian feel boasts stark, chilly lighting, to accompany the frosty indignities of solitude.

The man awakes from a restless sleep and makes himself a pot of coffee. The kitchen light falls down on his wavy hair, more salt than pepper, and his once-youthful body, now a strange topography of sags and folds. He shuffles into the living room, sits down at his desk, and attempts to write. That scene comes early in French writer-director-actor Jacques Nolot 's Before I Forget , but it's typical of many that follow in this exquisitely sad, idiosyncratic film à clef about an aging gay gigolo grasping at the embers of memory before they—and he—turn to ash.
This is the third semi-autobiographical feature made by Nolot, who collaborated on the scripts for several André Téchiné  movies and may be best known to arthouse audiences as the husband who mysteriously disappears at the start of François Ozon 's Under the Sand . In his previous feature, La Chatte à Deux Têtes  (which showed up on these shores in 2003 bearing the considerably less allusive English title Porn Theater ), Nolot starred as the nameless 50-year-old patron of a crumbling Paris porn cinema who pines for the handsome young man in the projection booth. This time, Nolot's character has a name, Pierre, and he's closing in on 60, but the central themes of the work—decay and loss—remain unwavering.
Nolot plays Pierre with fossilized grandeur, as if he were the last sentry of some pre-AIDS Babylon . When we first encounter him, he's reeling from the latest departure of his older, wealthier, on-again/off-again lover, Toutoune. He travels the Paris streets like an elegant zombie, taking lonely meals in cafés, a small notebook at his side, spying on other men his age and wondering if he looks as tired as they do. He arranges—but doesn't particularly seem to enjoy—a rendezvous with a young hustler who asks him to crouch on all fours and squeal like a girl. He visits his therapist. Mostly, like the backyard traveler of John Cheever 's famous short story, "The Swimmer," he drops in on old friends and lovers and tries to take inventory of six decades of a life.
The conversations are frank and unsentimental, ranging over age and disease and the commerce of sex. The going rates for hustlers are bandied about as if they were the latest oil prices. At one point, Pierre refers to Toutoune as "my father, my mother, my bank." And in what may be the movie's pièce de résistance, Nolot crosscuts between the auction of paintings from Toutoune's estate—paintings that were to have been willed to Pierre—and Pierre arranging a delivery (which, we know by this point, will come with more than just groceries) from his local supermarket.
All in fair trade. Though he's HIV-positive, Pierre refuses to take any drugs that will risk making him look "like an Auschwitz  victim." But is it any surprise that, for an old gigolo, vanity goeth last before the fall?
