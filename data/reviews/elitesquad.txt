 In classic exploitation flick fashion, “Elite Squad,” a relentlessly ugly, unpleasant, often incoherent assault on the senses from Brazil  — and the baffling winner of this year’s top prize at the Berlin Film Festival —  wants to have its grinding violence and sanctimony too. The director is the promising José Padilha, here belly-flopping into fiction after soaring high in “Bus 174,” the powerful 2002 documentary he made with Felipe Lacerda about a desperate hijacking by a Rio slum dweller. Clearly taken with the lower depths, Mr. Padilha has returned to Rio’s homegrown war zones, this time armed with a screenplay he wrote with Rodrigo Pimentel and  Bráulio Mantovani, the author of “City of God,” the art-house-meets-grindhouse hit that clearly inspired this one.  The narrator, Nascimento (Wagner Moura), a captain in the special, black-shirted Rio police unit, is so close to the edge that he can’t stop his hands from shaking, fists from flying or mouth from flapping. Anxious to leave the elite squad, this dully repetitive if uninformative guide goes about trying to find a successor, a chore that soon involves a couple of rookies (André Ramiro and Caio Junqueira), both of whom have to be broken down before they can join up. Meanwhile, the pope is swinging into town, which means the captain must help sweep the slum. Bloody torture and bloodier death from cops and thugs ensue amid smeary, jittery camerawork and choppy edits that transform the visually disjointed, grim and dim spaces into confetti. Somewhere, Roger Corman is weeping.  “Elite Squad” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for ultraviolence.

Brazil�s powerful military police are elevated to Rambo-style heroes in �The Elite Squad,� a one-note celebration of violence-for-good that plays like a recruitment film for fascist thugs. Weinstein coin was injected on the basis of the script only, but after editing was over, tyro features helmer Jose Padilha decided a rewrite was in order, tacking on an omnipresent narration that�s meant to strengthen identification but instead will alienate intelligent viewers. Though pic was Brazil�s top grosser of 2007, arthouse auds elsewhere won�t coddle to the inescapable right-wing p.o.v.
Boffo biz at home was accompanied by major debates over the glorification of brutish police methods, especially since Brazilian cops already have a reputation for Dirty Harry-style vigilantism. On the one hand, �Elite Squad� is an honest picture of violence in the favelas, or slums, of Rio de Janeiro, and the rampant official corruption that sustains it. But pic presents its case by celebrating police psychopaths and ridiculing any attempts at social activism, or even emotion. Charges of fascism by pic�s critics aren�t merely knee-jerk liberal reactions, but an unimpeachable statement of fact.
BOPE is the elite squad in question, a small tactical force sent into the favelas to kill without thinking (not coincidentally, black uniforms and the group�s skull symbol recall the SS Death�s Head Brigade). Capt. Nascimento (Wagner Moura) is getting ready to pass the baton of command to someone else. With wife Rosane (Maria Ribeiro) pregnant, he�s feeling a tinge of paternal warmth that could jeopardize the hard-ass heartlessness his job requires.
Parallel to Nascimento�s story is that of a couple honest police rookies,  intellectual Andre Matias (Andre Ramiro) and impulsive Neto (Caio Junqueira). Nascimento�s narration continuously comments on their progress as the two chafe under the police force�s systemic corruption. When their commander sends them into a slum rave, fully expecting their deaths, BOPE comes to the rescue, ending the battle just in time for Nascimento to get a call from his wife telling him her water broke � how�s that for timing?
Neto and Matias are so impressed with BOPE�s righteous dedication they decide to switch forces; after passing them through predictably sadistic basic training, Nascimento considers one of them as his replacement. Meanwhile, Matias tries to reconcile his studies, and relationship with namby-pamby NGO do-gooder Maria (Fernanda Machado), with the �no emotion� requirements of the elite squad. Neto seems poised for the captaincy, but then a battle with drug dealer Baiano (Fabio Lago) changes the hierarchy.
�Either a cop stays dirty or he chooses war,� intones Nascimento�s incessant voiceover as he explains the way the system works: Regular policemen are simply on the take, social workers are hopelessly ineffectual and naive, and pot-smoking rich kids are as bad as the dealers. Whereas the cops enter the favelas to get their payoff money, BOPE raids the slums to kill, no questions asked. After all, that�s what these scum deserve, isn�t it?
Script was co-written by Rodrigo Pimentel, himself a former BOPE officer, though Padilha encouraged improvisation throughout the shoot. Braulio Mantovani (�City of God�) was signed as script doctor, but together with the helmer, they changed the entire structure in the editing process, adding the problematic voiceover, presumably in a bid to bring one character�s mindset to the fore.
Perfs are suitably intense but, like the pic itself, lack any kind of nuance. Lula Carvalho�s camera never stops moving, bouncing and swerving with such unmodulated motion that auds will need to find their sea legs. More tempered lensing would have created a smoother build-up, though �Elite Squad� isn�t exactly out for the subtlety prize. Darkly saturated colors are in keeping with the general air of danger and militaristic cool. 



As ambiguous in its accused fascist leanings as the original Dirty Harry  —and yet as reflective of its homeland's domestic turmoil as America's cop dramas and Italy's poliziotteschi  were in the 1970s—this latest pounding slice-of-thug-life thriller from Brazil packs the same cinematic firepower as City of God , only on the other side of the law. This time, it's the cops who are trailed with grainy urgency by anxious hand-held cameras: They're members of the BOPE, a killer-elite strike team that wages war on the drug lords who rule the favelas  while Rio's corrupt cops look the other way. On one side is Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura ), a burned-out hardliner in desperate need of retirement, whose cold-blooded narration frames the action; on the other are gun-crazy hard-knock psychos and dilettante rich-kid pot dealers—with the middle class lost somewhere in between. The jabbing tone, point-blank violence, and jittery visual syntax will be familiar to any fan of The Shield , as will the simultaneous attraction/repulsion to locked-and-loaded fuck-Miranda homeland security. But Bus 174  director José Padilha , working from a script co-written by former BOPE officer Rodrigo Pimentel , precariously pitches the squad's brute force as less a necessary evil than the outgrowth of an existing evil—a no-win situation that mocks liberal ideals and warps conservative pragmatism into domestic terrorism. The setting may be pre-9/11—1997, to be precise—but the movie's bleak choices are definitely post-Gitmo .
