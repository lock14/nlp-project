         Filled with angry indictments and images of horrific violence, Philippe Diaz's "The Empire in Africa" is a nerve-jangling account of the civil war that ravaged Sierra Leone from 1991 to 2002. It is also, from the title onward, a blunt and sometimes shakily argued attack on Western powers, the United Nations and Sierra Leone's current government, here characterized as little more than a puppet regime installed through fraudulent elections.
 
 In a conflict that took more than 50,000 lives, there is plenty of blame to go around, and Diaz does not entirely spare the Revolutionary United Front, or RUF, the anti-government rebels generally associated with the gruesome practice of amputating the limbs of civilians (purportedly in response to President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah's campaign slogan, "The Future Is in Your Hands").
 


         






   But Diaz is so determined to present the RUF as an African liberation movement struggling against the remnants of colonial oppression that he accepts their version of events even when it strains credulity, and dismisses as "propaganda" all claims to the contrary.
 
 If "Empire" fails to convincingly cast the RUF as populist liberators, it is far more successful in impugning the credibility of the international community. Diaz makes a compelling case that European and American powers, as well as Sierra Leone's African neighbors, are at least as interested in the country's rich natural resources as its democratic prospects, and offers evidence to suggest that they deliberately starved the country's populace to undermine a 1997 coup.
 
 But while it condemns Nigeria for sending troops and South Africa for supplying mercenaries, the movie curiously omits Liberia, whose ousted president Charles Taylor was a major supporter of the RUF.
 
 Diaz also accuses the media of sensationalizing the amputation epidemic while ignoring the conflict's deeper roots, a point swiftly made with shots of Kabbah, Kofi Annan and Madeleine Albright all cradling the same 5-year-old amputee for the benefit of the cameras.
 
 Diaz would have a stronger case if he didn't linger on images of men being shot and dismembered in the street, and a young boy being stripped naked and beaten by uniformed troops. Presented with little in the way of context or explanation, the grisly images are disturbing without being enlightening. Something horrible is happening, but it's not always clear what.
 
 "The Empire in Africa's" ramshackle portrait of Sierra Leone is worlds away from the big-budget carnage of "Blood Diamond," with whose release the film has been timed to coincide. ("Empire," which has been making the rounds of film festivals since January, makes no direct reference to the Leonardo DiCaprio movie, but Diaz angrily denounces the film, and particularly its portrayal of the RUF, on his distributor's website.)
 
  That "Empire" lacks clear-cut heroes and villains is not necessarily a fault, but the movie's muddle too often comes across as an attempt to avoid assigning responsibility where it belongs.

 A forest of talking heads and pointing fingers, “The Empire in Africa” is a noble but failed attempt to explicate the tragedy of the 11-year civil war in Sierra Leone. Filmed in 2002 during the final months of the conflict, the movie (which is being released on the same day as the Sierra Leone-based thriller “Blood Diamond”) is a head-spinning litany of coups and insurgencies, bombings and executions, rampaging militias and civilian torment.  One after another, indignant interviewees — including businessmen, soldiers, politicians and government officials — offer theories and assign blame, while the sick and the maimed stare silently into the camera. Everyone, it seems, is culpable (“You change the driver, the vehicle is still the same,” says one civilian), but the director, Philippe Diaz, blames the international community and its determination to retain control of the country’s mineral wealth. Unfortunately, his clear sympathy for the rebels of the Revolutionary United Front — whose commander, Mike Lamin, is granted plenty of screen time — only undermines the film’s objectivity and further muddies the discourse.  In the end, all that is clear is the suffering, and we watch in horror as civilians are gunned down before our eyes and mutilated corpses pile up in the streets. It’s left to Sylvie Brunel, a relief worker with Action Against Hunger, to state the obvious: that there are countries outside international law “where it is unclear who is responsible” for  atrocities. To that extent, “The Empire in Africa” gets it right.

Infused with a strong sense of moral outrage, "The Empire in Africa" provides more heat than light while attempting to explain the motives and methods of combatants who waged the 1991-2002 civil war in Sierra Leone. Despite its literal and figurative overkill in presenting images of horrific violence, pic could find receptive auds at niche fests and nonprofit venues.
Filmmaker Philippe Diaz makes a strong case for blaming the international community in general, and the United Nations in particular, for the needless protraction of a conflict that left 70,000 dead and millions displaced. Unfortunately, he undermines his reasoned (and largely persuasive) arguments by often coming across as an apologist for rebels of the Revolutionary United Front. Filmmaker even suggests Sierra Leone government officials were merely pitching propaganda while displaying victims of RUF atrocities. (Thousands of civilians had limbs amputated or were otherwise maimed by rebel forces.) To his credit, however, Diaz also acknowledges there is plenty of blame to go around when documenting the deaths of innocent bystanders during more than a decade of hostilities. "The Empire in Africa" won the jury prize for docus at Slamdance 2006.

Cannily timed by lefty distributor Cinema Libre Studio to coincide with the release of Edward Zwick 's Blood Diamond , Philippe Diaz 's documentary claims to present Sierra Leone 's civil war in a radically different light. More accurately, it shifts the emphasis and fills out the picture. Where Zwick fingers diamond moguls and the rebel Revolutionary United Front  as chief culprits in the carnage, Diaz rushes to the defense of the RUF, which he sees as betrayed by a puppet government put in place by a United Nations  bent on squeezing the rebels with food and weapon embargoes. Diaz's sympathy for the RUF may or may not be symptomatic of the leftist tendency to sanctify anything that calls itself a revolutionary front. Certainly, while he briefly concedes the RUF's involvement in atrocities, most of the brutality he shows is perpetrated by United Nations peacekeepers. Whether you believe the coda of Blood Diamond , which tells us that today Sierra Leone is at peace, or that of The Empire in Africa , which ends by ranking the country as one of the poorest in the world, the real tragedy of Sierra Leone, and of much of the region, is that both can be truebut only for so long.
