For most of "Beverly Hills Chihuahua," all I could think about was Drew Barrymore. What might she have been up to while she recited her lines for Chloe, the spoiled yet sad-looking live-action Chihuahua that speaks in her voice. Did she keep a Diet Coke in her recording booth? Did she flip through an Us Weekly between takes, or send Cameron Diaz annoyed text messages. ("OMG, how did u do 3 Shreks? So bored.")
And what about when George Lopez was around? He does the voice of Papi, the Chihuahua who comes to Chloe's rescue after Mexican dogfighters nab her and she finds herself virtually homeless in Mexico City. Did Lopez and Barrymore have to share a microphone when Chloe tells Papi, "Tú eres mi corazón?" It's hard to imagine.
When Andy Garcia came in to do his work as Delgado, the gruff Mexican German Shepherd with the heart of gold, did he pass the time staring at the check from Walt Disney? Does Andy Garcia have direct deposit?
Did he get to share a booth with Edward James Olmos, who does the voice of Diablo, the champion Mexican fighting dog. And how exactly do you say to Plácido Domingo, "Plácido, we've got this great film part for you. It's a dog." Did Paul Rodriguez and Cheech Marin have to think twice about having to play an iguana and a rat, both Mexican? "What, we don't get to be dogs, too?"
There are humans. Manolo Cardona plays Sam, a landscaper who goes with pampered Rachel (Piper Perabo) to look for Chloe (who belongs to Aunt Jamie Lee Curtis). Rachel is a nitwit, but Sam is crazy about her anyway.
If I were a Latino actor and my agent sent me a script about a rich Chihuahua with white fur who goes slumming with mangy brown dogs south of the border, who attends a breed's uprising inside Aztec ruins ("We Chihuahuas shake not for the amusement of humans. We shake because we have souls!" Or something like that), the movie might give me pause. Forget the metaphors, why not just make a movie about poor, exploited Mexicans?
The agent would roll her eyes. "Kids don't want to see that movie. They want to see the movie where the Chihuahua rides a train, wears a diamond necklace, faces mountain lions, licks the stuffing out of Jamie Lee Curtis, and sounds cute, like Drew Barrymore. In this economy, that movie will be a smash." And the agent would be correct.


Isn't it time someone made a kiddie comedy starring Triumph the Insult Comic Dog? I know, I know  he's a bit racy for the preteen set. But the naughtiest word to come out of Triumph's mouth is ''poop,'' and any random three minutes of his hilarious hot-pepper razzing has more surprise and wit and sheer barbed fun than the soggy-cardboard excuse for a talking-canine romp that is Beverly Hills Chihuahua . Chloe, the pampered white pooch of the title, is voiced by Drew Barrymore as the most innocuously adorable of princesses; after landing in the street, she takes a lifetime in dog years to get down to Mexico, where she joins a Chihuahua revolution. You could say Beverly Hills Chihuahua  is Lady and the Tramp  meets Viva Zapata! , but seriously, I've seen zestier attitude in a Purina commercial. While George Lopez, Cheech Marin, and Paul Rodriguez are funny men, it's amazing how boring these Latin-shtick cutups can be when none of them gets a single good line.

 If you’re going to make anything as ridiculous as a talking-dog movie, you might as well go all the way. “Beverly Hills Chihuahua” approaches but never quite achieves a truly spectacular level of absurdity;  that is, until it reaches the ancient Aztec homeland of the fearsome Chihuahua race.  Chloe (voice of Drew Barrymore), the pampered pooch of a megarich cosmetics mogul (Jamie Lee Curtis, in the flesh), is lost in Mexico and about to be devoured by three poorly animated cougars. Enter a mighty tribe of feral Chihuahuas with digital lips, who sweep Chloe away and teach her the power of saying “no más.”  No más to funny little outfits! No más to sitting on laps! You are Chihuahua! Where is your bark?  Chloe does indeed find her bark, which evidently has the power to make nearby architecture collapse. As for Rachel (Piper Perabo), the empty-headed dog sitter who misplaced her rich aunt’s most prized possession in the first place, she learns that it’s  O.K. to love the Mexican gardener (Manolo Cardona) as long as he’s outrageously handsome, speaks perfect English and calls himself a “landscaper.”  As multimillion-dollar frivolities about the pets of the ruling class go, “Chihuahua” is reasonably diverting. As one that happens to be opening  in the middle of an economic meltdown, its mere existence feels utterly insane.  “Beverly Hills Chihuahua” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It flaunts obscene  wealth  and ethnic stereotypes.

A filthy-rich fantasy for these cash-strapped times, "Beverly Hills Chihuahua" features the voices of Drew Barrymore and much of the industry�s top Latino talent in a live-action talking-dog lark that should please young pups. At the same time, it peddles tacky stereotypes in thick Hispanic accents, effectively ceding whatever dignity the breed regained since the "Yo quiero Taco Bell" campaign went off the air. One thing�s for sure: The Mouse House will realize a fine balance of trade on this one.
The Elle Woods of pocket pets, Chloe doubles as both companion and ultimate fashion accessory to her owner, celebrated cosmetics designer Vivian (Jamie Lee Curtis). Viv takes great pleasure in pampering her pet, which has given the dainty white-haired Chihuahua (voiced with just the right dose of California-girl bounce by Barrymore) something of a superiority complex toward lesser dogs, such as Papi (George Lopez), the brown-skinned stray who hangs around the estate with hunky Mexican landscaper Sam (Manolo Cardona).
When Viv is called away to Europe on business, she entrusts her prized pooch to less-than-responsible niece Rachel (Piper Perabo), but instead of following Viv�s detailed itinerary of doggie Pilates and pedicures, the party girl whisks Chloe off to Mexico, allowing the dog to get loose while she�s out dancing with friends. 
Instead of letting Chloe have fun with her "freedom," the film paints Mexico as a dangerous place full of conmen and criminals. Shivering in her custom pink booties, with only a surly German Shepherd named Delgado (Andy Garcia) to help her, Chloe must contend with a dog-fighting Doberman (Edward James Olmos), a sticky-fingered street rat (Cheech Marin), an immigrant-smuggling coyote (Ed F. Martin) and a sinister-looking thug (Jose Maria Yazpik) who aims to ransom Chloe back to her owner.
Kids won�t pick up on the politically incorrect subtext, of course, and the performances supply far more than ethnicity to the characters. The lone gringa, Chloe may be a brat, but Barrymore possesses one of the most endearing voices in the biz, and she plays the role with helpful nuance: She is polite in her bigotry, naive in her self-entitlement and gracious toward those small kindnesses other characters show her. Garcia aces an equally tricky role, as Delgado cautiously opens up to Chloe � the standoffish bonding making sense over time. (Other highlights include Placido Domingo as proud Chihuahua leader Montezuma and "Ugly Betty�s" Michael Urie as a gay pug.)
Writers Jeffrey Bushell and Analisa LaBianco are in familiar territory, which makes the witty repartee more important than the story. Gone are the days when Disney critter features, such as "The Incredible Journey" or "The Legend of Lobo," permitted the animals to have adventures without talking. Here, the chatty canines are both smarter and more entertaining than their human counterparts.
Curtis has little screen time, and Perabo and Cardona�s sole function seems to be illustrating that interracial romance can also exist between people. Seeing the human couple end up together may distract kids from Chloe�s unclear arc: If she�s ultimately destined to return home to Beverly Hills, what lessons will she take with her from her harrowing Mexican journey?
With years of experience in the field, visual effects crews have aced the task of manipulating doggie jowls so they convincingly appear to be speaking, although they do seem to have gone overboard with the eyebrows. Instead of striking a familiar expression and holding it, the way real dogs do, these characters� digitally-enhanced faces appear to be in constant motion. Two completely CG characters � a rat and an iguana (Paul Rodriguez) � blend right in, though a mountain lion confrontation seems to have been rendered on the cheap.
Director Raja Gosnell, of the "Scooby-Doo" live-action series, has experience with these live-action/animation hybrids and shows confidence in engineering a crowd-pleaser from the ingredients at hand. Gosnell may not be aiming high, but the pic cuts together smoothly enough, with an added jolt from such obvious song picks as "Rich Girl" and "Low Rider" (but amazingly not dog-movie standard "Who Let the Dogs Out").
