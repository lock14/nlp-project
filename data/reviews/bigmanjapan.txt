Midnight madness doesn't begin to describe this strange Japanese import. A popular favorite at numerous festivals (including last year's Fantastic Fest in Austin), the film is a modern superhero story that combines elements from Japanese monster movies, mockumentaries, comedies, and downright demented CGI fantasies. Matsumoto, a huge TV celebrity in Japan, directs, co-writes, and stars in the movie as Dai Sato, a nondescript, downbeat, middle-aged man, who in the opening scenes has an offscreen camera crew inexplicably following him around and asking him questions. It's hard to imagine anyone being interested in this lug, much less a camera crew. Like other workaday salarymen in Japan, he complains about not being paid enough, and his modest digs are proof of that statement. He's separated from his wife and sees his daughter rarely. He's employed by the Ministry of Defense and he's always on call. But until we see what he actually does, the viewer is mystified by what the videographers see in Sato. Then he gets the call, and races off to the nearest electrical power station and, after electrodes are attached to his body, he transforms into the giant superhero Big Man Japan, who wears nothing but purple underpants and a Don King-style haircut. The baddies he faces are bizarre inventions that seem like they're somebody's hallucinogenic outpourings on bad drugs: There's an evil-eye monster that is essentially a walking eyeball and a strangling monster with a bad comb-over that can uproot buildings by encircling them with his expandable arms. As always in Japanese monster movies, the populace accepts the existence of these unearthly creatures as part of the normal fabric of life, although they are beginning to tire of Big Man Japan, whom they accuse of causing a nuisance and losing his edge. Even his agent (Ua) is frustrated with him and implores him to wear advertising on his body to pay the rent. Even though the film has many very funny moments (the sight of the big purple underpants pinned wall-to-wall for Sato's transformation into Big Man Japan and the wacky closing credits, for example), Matsumoto generally plays the film straight � all the better to sustain the illusion created by this strange blend of documentary realism and pure fantasy. The effects are reasonably well-created, though hardly transparent. The last 15 minutes of the film spins out into unimaginable realms. Fans of this kind of stuff will leave smitten; those accompanying them to the theatre will have a pretty good time too. (See "'Big' in Japan, but What About Austin?

 The revisionist superhero trend takes a quizzical turn in “Big Man Japan,” a deadpan mockumentary with a lively sense of the perverse. Hitoshi Matsumoto, a popular and eccentric Japanese comedian who is the co-writer of the film, also directed and stars in it, playing Daisato,  the latest — and least — in a line of metamorphic heroes who grapple with Japan’s persistent monster problem.  Daisato transforms, via the application of electricity to his nipples (and some third-rate computer graphics), into a lumbering giant with an “Eraserhead” hairdo. But his everyday life couldn’t be smaller. Recently separated from his wife, Daisato mopes in the company of a scene-stealing stray cat, despondent over his nation’s increasing annoyance with the destruction and wanton wasting of resources that he leaves in his wake.  Worse yet, his ratings are down. Part character study, part media  satire and, by its finale, altogether bizarre, “Big Man Japan” plays a bit like a quieter, weirder version of “Hancock.”  The story alternates between Daisato’s daily doldrums — hanging out at his regular noodle joint or karaoke bar, slumping on a park bench — and his battles with threats like an eyeball-throwing monster and a creature emitting dangerously foul odors.  But the most impressive special effect here is Mr. Matsumoto’s hilariously restrained performance, a tour de force of comedic concision in a movie bloated by increasingly surreal developments.  “Big Man Japan” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for monster sexuality and cartoon violence.

Dai Nipponjin" has to be, hands down, the strangest picture in Cannes this year. Decidedly odd, even by Japanese standards, this mockumentary about an electrically charged, skyscraper-high superhero saddled with misfortune, bad press and even worse TV ratings is tears-down-the-face funny and a genuine, jaw-dropping oddity. A must for midnight madness slots as well as Asia and fantasy-themed fests, pic will astound auds of all stripes. A long and healthy life as an ancillary cult item awaits.
Film begins with a long and only mildly amusing burn, with shaggy-haired, weirdly dressed regular-Joe, Dai Sato (Hitosi Matumoto), being interviewed by an unseen TV crew in and around his abusively graffiti-strewn suburban house. People in the street stare at the docu subject, but other than his interest in small umbrellas and dehydrated seaweed, there seems nothing remarkable about him. Sato complains he is never able to take a holiday or spend time with his young daughter when he receives a call from the Defense Dept. that he has to go to work.
Riding his motorbike to a Tokyo electricity power station, Sato passes several personally addressed signs indicating his widespread unpopularity with Japanese citizens. Going off-camera for security reasons, Sato enters the plant and, with a burst of electricity and a deafening roar that resembles a sonic boom, he grows, courtesy of lush computer animation, into an "Incredible Hulk"-like humongous tattooed man in purple underpants and an "Eraserhead" hairstyle.
The CGI Sato goes into battle against a leviathan resembling a slimmed down Michelin man with a comb-over and a penchant for picking up skyscrapers with its stretchy looped arms.
Rest of the pic both repeats and develops this battleground premise with each subsequent monster opponent more audacious than the last. Each clash is separated by more of Sato's regular life, including his visits to the Alzheimer-affected fourth Dai Nipponjin (translating directly as Big Japanese Person) who is Sato's retirement-home-residing elderly grandfather.
What should have been a one-note joke is explored and pushed and pulled in endless directions and, miraculously, never looses its freshness.
Finale is a bizarre parody of U.S.-Japan-North Korea international relations as enacted by superbeings from each country. Credits crawl is accompanied by a gut-bustingly funny portrayal of the Stateside superheroes acting like a dysfunctional family while Sato is an embarrassed dinner guest.
Creation by Hitosi Matumoto -- who acts as director, co-writer and thesp -- seems to have sprung directly and perfectly from his subconscious. Helming is an efficient rendition of the mockumentary style. At the opposite end of the realism spectrum, CGI sequences are well handled.
Deadpan perfs are hilarious. Sound quality is resoundingly good, and stylishly underlines the monster battle scenes.
A popular standup comedian in Japan, Matumoto is a notorious prankster. In this spirit, his name both onscreen, in press materials and in Queinzaine catalog is a deliberate misspelling of his actual name, Hitoshi Matsumoto.

Forget about kung fu pandas and get smart: There's more to summertime at the multiplex than mediocrity—the New York Asian Film Festival , for one. Subway Cinema's seventh annual extravaganza of demented pop curiosities both highbrow and low- returns with its largest lineup and juiciest cherry pickings yet. Among the 43 new features are an Indonesian noir-thriller (Kala ), '20s-set Vietnamese actioner (The Rebel ), a flashy doc about mistreated South Korean stuntmen (Action Boys ), two from beloved Hong Kong auteur Johnnie To  (Mad Detective  and Sparrow ), and fanboy icon Takashi Miike 's nutty, newly condensed spaghetti eastern (Sukiyaki Western Django ), which can't even be called his "latest" since the hyper-prolific director is already a few films beyond it and has probably shot another in the time that it took you to read this far.
Django , one of the several Japanese titles to dominate this year's schedule, will be co-presented with the Japan Society 's concurrent "Japan  Cuts" fest—and easily the finest of NYAFF's offerings exist within the programming overlap. A case in point is Satoshi Miki 's Adrift in Tokyo , a comic stroll that is indeed aimless, but consciously, introspectively, and out-of-left-field hilariously so. Nervous college slacker Takemura (megastar Jô Odagiri ) finds himself in a bad spot, threatened by impulsive, mullet-haired debt collector Fukuhara (former '70s heartthrob Tomokazu Miura ), who makes a strangely generous offer to his debtor: Walk with him across Tokyo for as long as he demands, and the slate will be wiped clean—but why? Fukuhara's cathartic reasoning (which you'll never guess) is revealed during this odd couple's ode to the city—a leisurely adventure of observational banter and random high-weirdness that includes a 66-year-old costumed hero leaping from a building to his all-white motorcycle. As linear as a road movie but uniquely structured to veer off the map, Miki's bizarre vision is sweet, not saccharine, and too modest to boast its cunning.
Veteran actor Ittoku Kishibe turns up repeatedly in the film as a meta-version of himself known to bring good luck. Between his memorable 2004 performance as a father hypnotized into becoming a bird in Survive Style 5+  and Miura's appearance that same year in the wonderful whatzit The Taste of Tea , Adrift in Tokyo  seems to have found its footing in a growing trend of quietly oddball, stream-of-consciousness Japanese dramedies—or, God help me, "J-quirk." Among its brethren at this year's NYAFF is janitor-turned-director Yosuke Fujita 's debut Fine, Totally Fine , a haphazardly romantic, deadpan comedy about two late-twentysomething brothers who fall for the same clumsy girl. One bro, a part-time park keeper, is entirely fixated on building the world's scariest haunted house. The other is a straitlaced hospital administrator, and no further character description is needed because the film digresses so far and frequently that its leads become supporting characters, plotlines mutate, and the only thing left to anchor it all is the pathos of growing older, learning from one's humiliations, and still retaining a heartfelt optimism for life. Even funnier and more outlandish than Adrift in Tokyo , the film's most surreal jokes linger long in the mind, such as the giant gum bubble that knocks a kid over, and the aforementioned klutz embarrassing a jumpy porn-buyer with her dreadful inability to open a box of tissues.
The J-quirkiest of the lot, hands down, is Dainipponjin , or Big Man Japan . I hurt myself laughing at this amazingly inventive mockumentary, and because it's so good, I refuse to give away much more than an insistent recommendation. A long-haired, sad-sack government employee, Dai-Sato (Hitoshi Matsumoto ), has somehow inspired a documentarian to follow him around as he eats lunch alone and extols the virtues of umbrellas (he likes anything that expands). In long takes that cut like early Jarmusch, the first half hour rambles on with downbeat wit before dropping a boulder of truth on our heads about the unlikely hero's job, why everyone in the city hates him, and how it involves electricity surging through his nipples and extensive CGI. Read nothing else about this film.
If midnight madness ain't your bag, hope is not lost. Japanese new waver Kôji Wakamatsu , now 72, will blow your mind and unsettle you to the bone with his brilliant, brutal, three-hour-plus docudrama United Red Army . More on this definitive account of the '60s college activists who (d)evolved by the early '70s into a frightening band of paranoid extremists in next week's issue.
