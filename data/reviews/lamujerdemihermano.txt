Soap masquerades as high art in this south-of-the-border romantic drama, which has nevertheless proved a huge hit during its Mexican and Latin American release. Essentially a gussied-up telenovela
, this film about a love triangle is predictable and thin, even though the actors are polished and cinematographer Andres Sanchez provides the film with a handsome look. Popular Peruvian novelist Jaime Bayly adapted his own work for the film�s screenplay but moved the story�s setting to Mexico City. Fellow Peruvian de Montreuil directs with a sure hand, although he�s unable to turn any of the three central characters into likable personalities. The likelihood of U.S. crossover success for La Mujer de Mi Hermano
 will rest primarily with Spanish-speaking audiences here that spark to its familiar melodramatic patterns and late-in-the-movie introduction of plot developments that involve abortion and homosexuality. After 10 years of marriage, Zoe (telenovela star Mori) has grown bored with her husband, Ignacio (Meier), and their glass-walled designer house. The marriage is relatively passionless (we learn that Ignacio will only make love to her on Saturdays), and though they wish to have a child it�s revealed that Ignacio is sterile. Ignacio�s brother Gonzalo (Cardona) is a painter, a womanizer, and something of a starving artiste, who lives off the money Ignacio gives him while thumbing his nose at the bourgeoisie. Soon Gonzalo and Zoe are sharing hot, illicit love. Despite the film�s title, which translates into English as My Brother�s Wife
, the story is not told from Gonzalo�s perspective. Zoe�s choices are starkly opposite: Stay with her disinterested and compulsively orderly husband, or flee to the arms of his paint-spattered, prodigal brother. The story�s third-act complications are a bit more involving, yet the characters never come across as anything more than self-interested parties. It�s hard to have a rooting interest in any of their fates, and even less in the outcome of this movie.

         As pared down, stylish and deceptively simple as the stark glass and concrete block inhabited by two of its main characters, "La Mujer de Mi Hermano" (My Brother's Wife) is an adultery drama that skips the big life lessons in favor of observing the mysteries of human interdependency and social behavior.
 
  Peruvian director Ricardo de Montreuil has transposed the characters created by his compatriot, novelist Jaime Bayly, from Lima to Mexico City and has cast Mexican stars in three of the film's four principal roles. The idea behind the relocation was to broaden the film's global appeal, as Mexican films tend to be well received across Latin America and within the United States. Accents and local slang are duly adjusted, but the shift feels academic. "La Mujer de Mi Hermano" blooms inside only the most insular, intimate spaces, its characters untouched by the world around them. If anything, it's a reminder that class — especially the upper echelons — is a country unto itself that doesn't recognize geographical borders.
 


         






    Disturbingly beautiful and melancholic Zoë (Barbara Mori) lives with her image-obsessed husband, Ignacio (Christian Meier), in an ultra-modern house — half display case, half hothouse — on the outskirts of the city. Ignacio is wealthy and doting but distant, and their marriage is affectionate but passionless. Ignacio's sterility and Zoë's refusal to consider adoption compound the feeling that the marriage has cruised into a cul-de-sac.
 
  Zoë's complaints, which she shares with her gay friend Boris (Bruno Bichir), are legitimate, but it's Ignacio who elicits sympathy at first. Genuinely afraid of losing Zoë, he exudes a tightly wound, reined-in helplessness that's painful to watch. The feeling is cemented when Zoë starts hanging around with Ignacio's estranged younger brother, Gonzalo (Manolo Cardona), a painter who bad-mouths Ignacio at every opportunity but gladly takes his money each month. When Zoë drops by his gallery unexpectedly, Gonzalo sells her a painting from his show. The selling, rather than giving, becomes another point of contention between Gonzalo and Ignacio, but for Zoë it's a chance to get back at her husband.
 
  The principal pleasures of the film lie in the subtle shifts in character that prompt shifts in allegiance, so I won't spoil them. The main thing is that "La Mujer de Mi Hermano" lets its characters' behaviors speak for themselves, which naturally lead the audience into snap judgments that evolve into something more fluid and forgiving.
 
  Tall and broad, Meier has a rigid, hulking quality that serves him well as the high-strung businessman scared stiff of losing his wife. For a guy built like a pylon, he has a remarkable way of making himself small by tucking himself into a neat package.
 
  Mori, a memorable presence, plays an instantly recognizable type nonetheless rarely seen onscreen. Zoë's uncommon beauty masks her neediness, insecurity and loneliness. Mexican star Angélica Aragón plays Cristina, the mother of Ignacio and Gonzalo, a woman who sees strictly what she wants to see and nothing more.
 
  A final twist — a bit of a corker — threatens to push what has otherwise been a cool-headed emotional experience into the realm of melodrama. Despite this false note, "La Mujer de Mi Hermano" keeps a cool eye trained on its characters as they struggle to make their lives conform to some strict phantom ideal.
 
  For a movie about an inter-family dalliance, it's far more pragmatic than you might expect, and far more humane. Ultimately, "La Mujer de Mi Hermano" offers the uncommon (in movieland) perspective that it may be the ideal that oppresses life, not the other way around.

 If you were a stunningly beautiful woman whose husband would rather have his back waxed than his fancy tickled, would your suspicions be aroused? Not if you were Zoë (Bárbara Mori), a vapid wife whose brain activates just long enough each day to tally the 20 grapes she eats for breakfast. When not counting tiny fruit, Zoë longs for children, but her de-furred spouse (Christian Meier) makes love only on Saturdays. With six days of mounting sexual tension to defuse, Zoë turns for comfort to her rebellious brother-in-law (Manolo Cardona), a smoldering artist whose Ralph Lauren underwear beckons enticingly from above the waistband of his low-slung jeans. Ay caramba!  With its overheated narrative, lush interiors and photogenic cast, "La Mujer de Mi Hermano" is a big-screen telenovela in which everyone is cheating and every light is flattering. Written by Jaime Bayly (adapting his own novel), the movie bubbles with incest, adultery, religion and homosexuality — steamy themes that incite the cast to fits of enthusiastic overemoting. The Peruvian director Ricardo de Montreuil counters all this heaving passion with elegant images and subtle camera movements, helped by Angelo Milli's classy score. But it's a lot of trouble to go to for a movie that considers procreation more important than honesty and what we want more important than who we are.  "La Mujer de Mi Hermano" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has picturesque sex, titillating language and excessive use of lip gloss.

If you strip "Unfaithful" of Adrian Lyne's touch or filter Kubrick out of "Eyes Wide Shut," they remain provocative looks at adultery. But, if you deprive desperate-housewife yarn "La mujer de mi hermano" of helmer Ricardo de Montreuil's polished approach, all that remains is a tawdry Telenovela. Soapy melodrama and a small-screen cast undermine the first-time director's efforts to dress up screenwriter Jaime Bayly's adaptation of his novel about a sexually unfulfilled married woman who beds her hubby's brother. Successful South-of-border run suggests Latin interest with limited crossover potential if Lionsgate positions the pic properly.
Although Uruguayan-born beauty Barbara Mori, a Spanish-speaking TV star, could easily cross over to English-language roles, this revealing lead perf does more to showcase the skills that landed her in the January 2004 issue of Maxim than those needed to put her in competition with Salma Hayek or Penelope Cruz.
The way Mori plays it, the title phrase -- which translates to "My Brother's Wife" -- conveys the same off-limits appeal reflected in the word "MILF."
Zoe Edwards (Mori) grows tired of her rich husband Ignacio (Christian Meier) and finds passion in the arms of his spontaneous younger brother Gonzalo (Manolo Cardona).
For at least the first half hour, pic sustains the illusion of artistic ambitions thanks to an elegant opening-credits sequence in which fallen leaves and doomed insects float adrift on water. Those images correspond to Ignacio's routine of cleaning his designer swimming pool, going out of his way to rescue a drowning beetle.
The pool provides a symbol (so does the impressive modern "glass house") as de Montreuil tries to bring class to a story destined to drown in its own suds.
Viewers needn't wait long for the hanky panky to commence: Things are already tense between brothers Ignacio and Gonzalo, while Zoe resents that her disinterested husband can't have children. There's little to suggest why Zoe and Ignacio are together in the first place, much less how they have lasted for nearly 10 years of marriage.
She is, as her gay best friend Boris (Bruno Bichir) suggests, far too beautiful to be ignored.
This daytime-TV-caliber setup favors shallow titillation over deeper psychology. The lovers are perpetually on the brink of discovery, but it's Zoe's inevitable pregnancy that thrusts everything out in the open.
For a modest South American melodrama, "La mujer de mi hermano" manages to tackle everything from adultery to incest to abortion and homosexuality, spanning roughly a year in the lives of its characters in 89 overcrowded minutes. A mesmerizing score from Angelo Milli ("Secuestro Express") and polished cinematography by d.p. Andres E. Sanchez (who also lensed de Montreuil's award-winning short "Amiga") give Zoe's marriage an almost chlorinated feel, but heat up when Gonzalo is around.
Camera (color), Andres E. Sanchez; editor, Rosario Suarez; music, Angelo Milli; art director, Wolfgang Burman; sound (Dolby Digital), Marcos de Aguirre. Reviewed at Lionsgate Screening Room, Santa Monica, March 17, 2006. MPAA Rating: R. Running time: 89 MIN. 
(Spanish dialogue)
 


With a plot so old it could have been scraped off of cave walls, this Latin American psychodrama pits desperate housewife Zoe (Bárbara Mori ) against frigid husband Ignacio (Christian Meier). The punch line: He'll have sex with her only on Saturdays. (Plus, Zoe wants a baby, and Ignacio fires blanks.) Their gorgeous, glass-and-concrete modern home is misery on ice. Enter Ignacio's brother Gonzalo (Manolo Cardona ), a prodigal artist who drinks, paints, sexes up the ladies, and mooches off Ignacio while treating him like caca. Gonzalo has his reasons, and the movie gets interesting once they're revealed. But that, like everything else, takes way too long. Part of La Mujer 's problem is its pace: Everything happens so slowly, and so meaningfully, that we see it coming for miles. Also, none of the three principals is remotely likable until the end, when their actions begin to make sense. Still, if you can stand everything leading up to them, La Mujer 's final scenes enact a clever and emotionally rewarding resurrection.
