 Doris Dörrie’s “Cherry Blossoms” is both a tender tale of cultural crossings and a double portrait of grief. At its center is a long-married provincial German couple, each member of which must confront the other’s death, one in prospect, the other in fact. The conceit that makes this reciprocity possible — one of those symptom-free incurable diseases that so frequently befall movie characters — may be hard to swallow, but once you accept it you can be charmed and touched by the way it plays out.  Rudi (Elmar Wepper) and Trudi (Hannelore Elsner) live in a picturesque Bavarian town. Two of their children live in Berlin, and another — Trudi’s favorite, a son named Klaus — in Tokyo, where his mother has always dreamed of going. Instead, she and Rudi make a dutiful trip to visit their son Karl (Maximilian Brückner), who lives in bourgeois comfort with his wife and two children, and daughter, Karolin (Birgit Minichmayr), who lives in a more bohemian milieu with her lesbian lover, Franzi (Nadja Uhl).  I don’t want to be coy, but I also don’t want to give away the narrative surprises threaded through this gentle, sentimental tale. It will spoil nothing, however, to say that by the end of the film both parents have died, and that each has contemplated the mixture of fulfillment and regret that has defined their relationship. The matter of mourning is handled with more delicacy than the intergenerational dimensions of the story, which are clumsy and overstated, especially when Klaus and Rudi, during the father’s awkward visit to Japan, must make up for years of silence and misunderstanding.  The most affecting insights offered by “Cherry Blossoms” are also, in a way, the most banal. Travel to a foreign land can give you a fresh perspective on your life. Old habits die hard. A new friend can soothe your pain. In Rudi’s case, friendship arrives in the person of Yu (Aya Irizuki), a waifish young Japanese woman who practices Butoh, the form of dance that Trudi also loves.  It sometimes seems as if Ms. Dörrie’s intention was not just to direct a movie partly set in Japan, but to make a Japanese movie. Her attempts to balance emotional circumspection with an openness to feeling, and to infuse her images with a simple, unaffected beauty, evoke a Japanese tradition going back to Kenji Mizoguchi and Yasujiro Ozu and flourishing in the work of Hirokazu Kore-eda. “Still Walking,” Mr. Kore-eda’s most recent film, shown last year in Toronto, shares with “Cherry Blossoms” an interest in how people grow old in a marriage and cope with loss.  But while Ms. Dörrie’s film is exquisitely shot, its themes and metaphors are obvious rather than subtle, and its emotional rhythms — rueful laughter punctuating the pathos — would not be out of place in a television drama. Too much is explained: we can appreciate the transitory beauty of cherry blossoms without being told that they are “a symbol of impermanence,” and the flies that serve a similar symbolic function don’t need to buzz around quite so insistently. Still, there is something quiet and real in the way that this film contemplates the curious interplay of happiness and sorrow.

Sure to trigger an untold number of check-up calls to parents, �Cherry Blossoms: Hanami� follows a grieving widower�s journey to Japan and a new understanding of both his late wife and himself. International flowering of busy writer-helmer Doris Doerrie, including recent Japan-set pics �Enlightenment Guaranteed� and �The Fisherman and His Wife,� ensures modest but solid arthouse biz. Pic bows March 6 domestically.
Upon learning her set-in-his-ways small-town civil servant husband Rudi (tube vet Elmar Wepper) is fatally ill, Trudi (Hannelore Elsner) persuades him to travel to Japan to visit their son, Karl (Maximillian Brueckner), and see Trudi�s beloved Mount Fuji. They only get as far as Berlin � where their other two grown children (Birgit Minichmayr, Felix Eitner) can barely squeeze them into their busy lives � and the Baltic Sea, where Trudi dies peacefully in her sleep without sharing Rudi�s diagnosis with him.
Rudderless in his quiet grief, Rudi shows up at Karl�s Tokyo door. Left alone most of the time by his brusque, workaholic son, Rudi begins to explore Tokyo, discovering a friend in teenage Butoh dancer Yu (Aya Irizuki). A pilgrimage to Mount Fuji yields the peace for which Rudi has been searching.
A successful novelist whose films bear the expansive plotting and telling character detail of the page, Doerrie never seems in any particular hurry to tell her tales, preferring the journey to the destination. Pic is marbled with telling visual metaphors, each of which is given ample room to breathe during story�s arc.
Cast is spot-on, with craft package to match. Per Doerrie, the tale was inspired by Yasujiro Ozu�s �Tokyo Story� and its own spiritual predecessor, Leo McCarey�s 1937 weepie �Make Way for Tomorrow.� Literal Japanese translation of �Hanami� is �to look at flowers,� and little-known Butoh dancing combines Japanese movement with German expressionism.



At least once a year, the canny distributors at Strand Releasing  shell out for a crowd-pleaser to shore up their artier numbers. To kick off 2009, they've opted for the latest from German writer-director Doris Dörrie , who started out just dandy with the outrageous 1984 comedy Men  and has settled for charming neo-hippie fripperies pretty much ever since. Life's rich impermanence looms large and heavy over this sweetly shopworn parable of transformation about an aging, routine-bound bourgeois (Elmar Wepper ) who adores his wife (Hannelore Elsner ) but has never grooved to her love of Japanese butoh, an art form combining hippie culture with German expressionist dance. Believe it or not, the couple is called Rudi and Trudi, and no source of pathos goes unmined as Rudi, suddenly alone, travels to Japan  to reconnect with one of his troubled children. Instead, with a homeless young butoh dancer (Aya Irizuki) murmuring spiritual nothings in his ear, he finds himself on an eleventh-hour journey to healing at the foot of scenic Mount Fuji . The best I can say for Cherry Blossoms  is that it's made with love; the worst, that it's been a big hit in Germany. Yearning for Ozu, Dörrie stops off at cute, and parks.
