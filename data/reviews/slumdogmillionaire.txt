In Slumdog Millionaire , directed by the whiz-bang fabulist Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, Sunshine), Jamal (Dev Patel), an 18-year-old Indian orphan who has spent his life scavenging on the streets, lands as a contestant on the Hindi version of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , and he wins  big. Don't worry, I'm not giving anything away: An opening title informs us that he wins 20 million rupees (in U.S. currency, that translates roughly as...an awesome amount of cash). The host (Anil Kapoor), who looks like Omar Sharif if he'd been a high-end vacuum-cleaner salesman, models his act on the British version of the show, which may be why he's a lot more condescending than the courtly Regis Philbin. Mercilessly, he mocks Jamal for being a ''chaiwalla'' (a boy who serves tea  extremely low on the class totem pole). Yet the kid is immune to insults  or, it seems, nerves  and he becomes a folk hero as he keeps knocking out those impeccable final answers.
The prospect of an uneducated orphan from the slums of Mumbai winning a pot of gold on a game show that hinges on worldly knowledge is, of course, the stuff of purest fairy tales. Based on Vikas Swarup's novel Q & A, with a script by Simon Beaufoy (The Full Monty ), Slumdog Millionaire  is nothing if not an enjoyably far-fetched piece of rags-to-riches wish fulfillment. It's like the Bollywood version of a Capra fable sprayed with colorful drops of dark-side-of-the-Third-World squalor. A framing device has Jamal being interrogated by Mumbai cops who want him to confess how he won the show (they believe, wrongly, that he cheated). To let us know how he won, the film keeps flashing back from Jamal's stint on Millionaire to scenes of his life as an innocently scheming Dickensian ragamuffin.
Orphaned during a riot, the young Jamal (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar) skips around India with his older brother, Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail), the two boys scrambling to survive in a bustling, hothouse landscape of exploitative treachery. They're detained, along with a bunch of other orphans, by a vile crook who doesn't just use them as beggars; in a touch to give Fagin the willies, he likes to blind his orphans by pouring boiling liquid into their eyes, because then they'll earn more sympathy from passersby. The two escape, along with a girl, Latika (Rubina Ali), whom Jamal falls for and keeps trying to rescue. But just as we're reeling from this close encounter with evil, the movie reveals its true, happy design: This episode, and others like it, provides Jamal with the precise piece of information  in this case, a song title  he'll draw on, years later, to answer the questions on Millionaire . The inventor of the revolver, the figure on a $100 bill (he learns that one while scamming U.S. tourists at the Taj Mahal) all the knowledge he'll need is offered by his life of hardship.
As Slumdog Millionaire  jumps from the fear and degradation of Jamal's childhood to the snippet of game-show victory each episode provides, the audience relaxes, secure in the knowledge that the hardship and cruelty on display are, in their way, as much of a fairy tale as the mad-money TV triumph they presage. Slumdog Millionaire  is brash and lively and compulsively watchable, but with Boyle working at full boil, it is also an unabashed concoction  a movie that turns the horror of broken Indian childhoods into a whooshingly blithe, in-your-face picaresque. Not since Les Miz  have you felt this gooey-good about kids whose lives were this bad.
We follow Jamal and Salim at three different ages (with two sets of nicely matched tyke actors), but it's when Jamal is 18, and played by Dev Patel, that the movie takes on a touch of gravitas. Patel is tall, with a serious thin mouth, sloping eyebrows, and a wiry boyish toughness rather like that of Shia LaBeouf; he holds the camera while appearing to do nothing  the mark of a star. Madhur Mittal, as the older Salim, is a study in contrast  a permed weakling who goes to work for a gangster  but I wish the grown-up Latika (Freida Pinto), whom Jamal finds enslaved to that same thug, looked less like a supermodel. It's all part of the movie's fanciful sentimental tidiness. Slumdog Millionaire  rousingly celebrates the escape from the slums, but since it’s Jamal’s childhood that allows him to win big on TV (and to win that girl), you could also say that the movie ennobles poverty.
Danny Boyle and Dev Patel talk about Slumdog Millionaire

 A gaudy, gorgeous rush of color, sound and motion, “Slumdog Millionaire,” the latest from the British shape-shifter Danny Boyle, doesn’t travel through the lower depths, it giddily bounces from one horror to the next. A modern fairy tale about a pauper angling to become a prince, this sensory blowout largely takes place amid the squalor of Mumbai, India, where lost children and dogs sift through trash so fetid you swear you can smell the discarded mango as well as its peel, or could if the film weren’t already hurtling through another picturesque gutter.  Mr. Boyle, who first stormed the British movie scene in the mid-1990s with flashy entertainments like “Shallow Grave” and “Trainspotting,”  has a flair for the outré. Few other directors could turn a heroin addict rummaging inside a rank toilet bowl into a surrealistic underwater reverie, as he does in “Trainspotting,” and fewer still could do so while holding onto the character’s basic humanity. The addict, played by Ewan McGregor, emerges from his repulsive splish-splashing with a near-beatific smile (having successfully retrieved some pills), a terrible if darkly funny image that turns out to have been representative not just of Mr. Boyle’s bent humor but also of his worldview: better to swim than to sink.  Swimming comes naturally to Jamal (the British actor Dev Patel in his feature-film debut),  who earns a living as a chai-wallah serving fragrant tea to call-center workers in Mumbai and who, after a series of alternating exhilarating and unnerving adventures, has landed in the hot seat on the television game show “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.” Yet while the story opens with Jamal on the verge of grabbing the big prize, Simon Beaufoy’s cleverly kinked screenplay, adapted from a novel by Vikas Swarup, embraces a fluid view of time and space, effortlessly shuttling between the young contestant’s past and his present, his childhood spaces and grown-up times. Here, narrative doesn’t begin and end: it flows and eddies — just like life.  By all rights the texture of Jamal’s life should have been brutally coarsened by tragedy and poverty by the time he makes a grab for the television jackpot. But because “Slumdog Millionaire” is self-consciously (perhaps commercially) framed as a contemporary fairy tale cum love story, or because Mr. Boyle leans toward the sanguine, this proves to be one of the most upbeat stories about living in hell imaginable. It’s a life that begins in a vast, vibrant, sun-soaked, jampacked ghetto, a kaleidoscopic city of flimsy shacks and struggling humanity and takes an abrupt, cruel turn when Jamal (Ayush Mahesh Khedekar), then an exuberant 7, and his cagier brother, Salim (Azharuddin Mohammed Ismail), witness the murder of their mother (Sanchita Choudhary) by marauding fanatics armed with anti-Muslim epithets and clubs.  Cast into the larger, uncaring world along with another new orphan, a shy beauty named Latika (Rubina Ali plays the child, Freida Pinto the teenager), the three children make their way from one refuge to another before falling prey to a villain whose exploitation pushes the story to the edge of the unspeakable. Although there’s something undeniably fascinating, or at least watchable, about this ghastly interlude — the young actors are very appealing and sympathetic, and the images are invariably pleasing even when they shouldn’t be — it’s  unsettling to watch these young characters and, by extension, the young nonprofessionals playing them enact such a pantomime. It doesn’t help even if you remember that Jamal makes it out alive long enough to have his 15 televised minutes.  It’s  hard to hold onto any reservations in the face of Mr. Boyle’s resolutely upbeat pitch and seductive visual style. Beautifully shot with great sensitivity to color by the cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, in both film and digital video,  “Slumdog Millionaire” makes for a better viewing experience than it does for a reflective one. It’s an undeniably attractive package, a seamless mixture of thrills and tears, armchair tourism (the Taj Mahal makes a guest appearance during a sprightly interlude) and crackerjack professionalism. Both the reliably great Irrfan Khan (“A Mighty Heart”), as a sadistic detective, and the Bollywood star Anil Kapoor, as the preening game-show host, run circles around the young Mr. Patel, an agreeable enough if vague centerpiece to all this coordinated, insistently happy chaos.  In the end, what gives me reluctant pause about this bright, cheery, hard-to-resist movie is that its joyfulness feels more like a filmmaker’s calculation than an honest cry from the heart about the human spirit (or, better yet, a moral tale). In the past Mr. Boyle has managed to wring giggles out of murder (“Shallow Grave”) and addiction (“Trainspotting”),  and invest even the apocalypse with a certain joie de vivre (the excellent zombie flick “28 Days Later”). He’s a blithely glib entertainer who can dazzle you with technique and, on occasion, blindside you with emotion, as he does in his underrated children’s movie, “Millions.” He plucked my heartstrings in “Slumdog Millionaire” with well-practiced dexterity, coaxing laughter and sobs out of each sweet, sour and false note.  “Slumdog Millionaire” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for brutal violence.

Driven by fantastic energy and a torrent of vivid images of India old and new, �Slumdog Millionaire� is a blast. Danny Boyle�s film uses the dilemma of a poor teenager suspected of cheating on the local version of �Who Wants to Be a Millionaire�� to tell a story of social mobility that is positively Dickensian in its attention to detail and the extremes of poverty and wealth within a culture. Originally a Warner Independent title, the picture has just been acquired by Fox Searchlight for release in the U.S., where it will open at Thanksgiving, although Warner Bros. retains an interest. Tasty item looks to catch on in a big way with young, adventurous and merely curious viewers in wide specialized release.
Surging with colors, music, the ever-present swarming multitudes and the vitality of its youthful characters, the pic begins disturbingly with the sight of police torturing a young man to make him confess how he�s been able to make a run up to the ultimate prize of 20 million rupees on the nation�s most popular quizshow. �I knew the answers,� the sullen fellow insists, and Simon Beaufoy�s intricate and cleverly structured script illustrates how that came to be.
Spurred by intermittent interludes devoted to 18-year-old Jamal Malik (Dev Patel) correctly answering the multiple-choice questions posed by �Millionaire� host Prem (Indian superstar Anil Kapoor) in front of a boisterous live studio audience, flashbacks slashingly present the devastatingly difficult but opportunistic childhoods of Jamal and his brother, Salim. Living in Mumbai�s most squalid slum, they lose their mother in a mob attack on Muslims. Forced to forage and live by their wits as they commit petty crimes, the boys make their lives more interesting when they accept a new partner, the adorable Latika, who smites 7-year-old Jamal to the quick.
The street kids learn more smarts from a Fagin-like operator who runs a sort of criminal orphanage in a remote area, sending his charges into the city for dishonest days� work. When it seems Jamal is about to have his eyes gouged out to make him a higher-earning beggar, the three make a desperate run for it. The boys manage to jump on a speeding train, but not Latika.
As these and many other stories of tragedy and exhilaration play out, it becomes clear that each one has taught Jamal something that directly informs his success on �Millionaire.� This device could have seemed contrived, but Boyle and Beaufoy, working from a novel by Vikas Swarup, uninsistently make the case that the most useful intelligence, in all its forms, comes from life experience.
Granted, the two brothers, once into their teens, don�t end up on the same road. In the film�s lightest and most amusing passage, they become self-appointed tour guides at the Taj Mahal, giving visitors funny misinformation and pulling little scams in sequences that effectively present touristic India from the p.o.v. of mischievous local youths. Shortly, however, their criminal enterprises become more serious, forcing them to scram back to Mumbai, where they find Latika in dubious circumstances.
Jamal takes small-time jobs and forlornly carries the torch for Latika while Salim rises in the criminal ranks, and the pic�s final stretch provides stunning views of enormous bad-taste skyscrapers rising from the very ground where the boys so insignificantly began their lives. The build-up to Jamal�s climactic appearances on �Millionaire� are milked for all they�re worth, as the entire country hangs on his every answer.
The tough look at poverty and crime at all levels of society shoves the occasional coincidences and questionable plot developments firmly to the side, and the rush Boyle manifestly got from shooting such an intense story on these locations is fully felt in the film. The logistic considerations alone must have been mind-boggling, as a majority of scenes include what seem like hundreds of bystanders. Lenser Anthony Dod Mantle�s camera is often on the prowl or the run, and it sometimes dashes through jammed streets and shantytown alleys at the speed of the sprinting kids themselves. Images are stunning sans arty posturing, and Chris Dickens� editing is breathless without being exhausting.
Mostly nonpro kids in the main roles are entirely credible and segue without confusion as three thesps assume each of the principals at different ages. Kapoor is perfect as the preening, melodramatic and devious gameshow host, and vet Irrfan Khan invests the interrogating officer with varied shades as matters proceed.
As drama and as a look at a country increasingly entering the world spotlight, �Slumdog Millionaire� is a vital piece of work by an outsider who�s clearly connected with the place. Musical elements provide a major kick, as does a rousing and unexpected end-credits dance number at a train station. 


Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? Well, who wouldn't in this economy, even if the currency in question is rupees and winning the loot means being pegged as a fraud, getting a firsthand education in "enhanced" interrogation methods, and having to relive some of the most painful moments of your past in order to prove your innocence? Such is the fate that greets Jamal, the 18-year-old Mumbai  street urchin turned game-show contestant at the center of Danny Boyle 's Slumdog Millionaire , an almost ridiculously ebullient Bollywood-meets-Hollywood  concoction—and one of the rare "feel-good" movies that actually makes you feel good, as opposed to merely jerked around.
Based on a novel by former Indian diplomat Vikas Swarup , the film opens with Jamal (played with terrific chutzpah by newcomer Dev Patel ) already in police custody, accused of somehow cheating during his appearance on the local version of Millionaire —which, in a nod to globalization, is all but indistinguishable from its British and American counterparts. Given the third degree by a tough but ultimately decent police inspector (the excellent Irfan Khan ) who demands to know how this lowly tea boy (or "chai wallah") from the slums could possibly know enough to advance to the show's 20-million-rupee final round, Jamal flashes back over the key events of a life that, quite literally, contains all the answers. The violent death of Jamal's mother at the hands of anti-Muslim extremists explains his familiarity with one of the Millionaire  questions; a childhood infatuation with Bollywood movie star Amitabh Bachchan  yet another; and so on.
The potential for a treacly Good Will Hunting  of the Mumbai ghetto abounds, but Boyle and screenwriter Simon Beaufoy  (The Full Monty ) think more in terms of a minor-scale Dickensian epic (with one major nod to Dumas): As Jamal journeys down memory lane, the crux of Slumdog Millionaire  becomes the pull of time and tide on the relationship between Jamal, his artful-dodger brother Salim, and the suitably beautiful, unattainable Latika (Freida Pinto ), the lifelong object of Jamal's undying affection. It's Jamal's dream to rescue Latika from her current situation as the semi-willing concubine of a Mumbai underworld heavy—the same one, as it happens, who has Salim on his payroll.
Zigging to and fro, Slumdog Millionaire  whips these familiar raw ingredients into a feverish masala, at once touristic and something deeper, that drenches the screen in the sights and sounds of modern Mumbai: Mischievous children scamper through mazes of corrugated-tin rooftops; crowds of washerwomen cleanse extravagantly colored fabrics in outdoor baths; eardrum-rattling traffic chokes the smoggy streets; trains clatter noisily into busy stations. So intent seems Boyle (and his ace cameraman, Anthony Dod Mantle ) on cramming as much visual and sonic information as possible into each second of the movie that even the English subtitles (which appear in colored rectangular boxes during the Hindi-language scenes) jostle for position in the already densely packed frames. That sort of hyped-up aesthetic can quickly turn wearying, as it has in several of Boyle's less successful ventures (including Shallow Grave  and the duly forgotten A Life Less Ordinary ), but here it is a fount of ever-renewable energy. "I am at the center of the center," Salim tells Jamal as they gaze out over the landscape of their former slum, now an oasis of skyward-reaching glass-and-steel towers. And watching Slumdog , you get the sense that, like Shanghai  as seen in the films of Jia Zhangke , this former stretch of colonial Britain is changing before our eyes faster than even Boyle's camera can capture it.
A dystopian by nature, whose films regularly move in the direction of entropic chaos, Boyle resists the natural tug of Slumdog Millionaire  toward happily-ever-after territory, counterbalancing each of Jamal's triumphs with equal or greater episodes of personal loss and steadfastly refusing the age-old movie wisdom that love conquers all (especially money). Yet it's that very tension between gritty, street-level reality and fairy-tale invention that ultimately makes Slumdog Millionaire  feel even more buoyant and life-affirming. Like so many of the Bollywood melodramas it stylistically apes, Boyle's film is unapologetically pop, even as Boyle himself seems to be at once inside and outside the idiom, embracing it while winking slyly at our collective need for escapist fantasy. Then, just when you figure he has pulled out all the stops, Boyle proves to have one more trick left up his sleeve: a joyous musical number that sends everybody out of the theater feeling like a winner.
