Although the online community has been positively abuzz regarding Cloverfield
 since a mysterious teaser trailer ran before screenings of Transformers
 this past summer, no one, not even the intrepid folks at 
cloverfieldclues.blogspot.com

, really knew much at all about the plot of this ultrasecret project from Lost
 creator J.J. Abrams and writer/director Reeves. I'm not going to spoil that mystery either, but I will say this: Cloverfield
 is the most intense and original creature feature I've seen in my adult moviegoing life, and that's coming from a guy who knows his Gojira
 from his Gamera
 and his Harryhausen from his Honda. Cloverfield
 isn't a horror film � it's a pure-blood, grade A, exultantly exhilarating monster movie
 in the grand tradition of The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms
, It Came From Beneath the Sea
, and, to a lesser extent, Merian C. Cooper's King Kong
. What makes Cloverfield
 so memorable and such a genuinely riveting filmgoing experience has less to do with the creature itself, whatever it is, and everything to do with Reeves' direction and a whip-smart, stylistically invisible screenplay that dispenses entirely with any and all genre rules and, brilliantly, views the catastrophic, literally earthshaking events through the lens of one character's digital video camera, complete with rough, nerve-jangling, in-camera edits and an "official" Department of Defense Eyes Only time stamp. It's Blair Witch
 meets Godzilla
, with the audience allowed only as much information about what, exactly, is happening as the characters have themselves, and it works fantastically well. And that's key to the film's second stroke of genius: its nearly subconscious evocation of our current paranoid, terror-phobic times. The pall of post-9/11 dread hangs over Cloverfield
 in a very emotionally tangible way, although it should be noted that Reeves and Abrams never directly refer to it (although they do, in a nice nod to genre enthusiasts, reference the one-sheet poster for John Carpenter's Escape From New York
). Sitting in the theatre, watching all hell break spectacularly loose in Lower Manhattan, again, you can't help but wish that giant behemoths and warring Gargantuas were all that our postatomic citizenry had to worry about. No such luck, and no giant flying turtle to save us, either.


Monster flick takes hold quickly and doesn't let go
After months of cryptic trailers and postmodern stealth hype, "Cloverfield" turns out to be almost comforting in its simplicity. It's a short, efficient, terrifying monster movie, no more and no less. It's also to New York City and the American psyche what "Godzilla" was to Tokyo: a cinematic fantasy response to unimaginable events. You get scared, you go home, you laugh it off. The real world should play so nice.
The math is preposterously easy, actually: "Cloverfield" equals "Godzilla" divided by "The Blair Witch Project." (And if you want to know nothing more before buying a ticket, stop reading right now.) Told solely from the point of view of one digital video camera wielded by one young guy named Hud (T.J. Miller), the film records scenes from a seven-hour attack on Manhattan by a Giant Thing. It's the first cellphone-ready action flick.
We aren't told where the Giant Thing came from or why it's so mad. Like any proper peep show, the filmmakers (the real filmmakers, I mean) keep us from getting a good look at it, or its little friends, until near the end. At first, it's just glimpsed far down the urban canyons, tossing buildings asunder and using the Statue of Liberty's head as a bowling ball. It is Disaster, literalized.
Hud's fleeing for his life with his friends: brothers Rob (Michael Stahl-David) and Jason (Mike Vogel), Jason's girlfriend Lily (Jessica Lucas), and a sardonic friend of Lily's named Marlena (Lizzy Caplan). They're young, good-looking, generically hip, and played by unknowns who share those qualities. I kept waiting for Scooby-Doo to turn up. Still, casting a familiar face would wreck the movie's this-is-really-happening conceit - it's the gimmick that's the star, and the monster - and the actors' anonymity works for the film. They're just like us, only disposable.
The first 20 minutes of "Cloverfield" take place at Rob's going-away party in an Upper West Side apartment, with some hugger-mugger about his aborted romance with a college friend named Beth (Odette Yustman). Hud's been handed the job of videotaping the farewell testimonials, and we keep catching glimpses of earlier footage he's accidentally taping over, of Rob and Beth's blissful day in Coney Island a month earlier.
These opening scenes play like a "Gossip Girl" episode without the deep philosophical subtext, but soon enough things start going boom downtown. The party takes to the roof for a look, then to the streets, then heads for the hills, which in New York means the Brooklyn Bridge. Given any self-respecting monster's attraction to architectural landmarks, this is probably a mistake. (If you're prone to motion sickness, incidentally, pop a Dramamine; the handheld visuals make the "Bourne" films look like Steadicam work by comparison.)
Eventually, some of our fine young mannequins decide to head back uptown to rescue the stranded Beth, which leads to what's easily the film's best and creepiest sequence: a long journey through dark subway tunnels that ends when someone tells Hud to turn on the camera's night-vision. The suspense waiting for that click of the switch is delicious, the payoff a moment of primal movie terror. You might applaud if you weren't busy screaming.
As with any disaster movie, the film's about helplessness in the midst of cataclysm; late in the game one of the characters moans, "I don't know why this is happening!" "Cloverfield" specifically plays fast and loose with the iconography of 9/11, though: clouds of dust erupting up the city's avenues, the crowds on the bridge, famous buildings sliding down like melting ice shelves. (The filmmakers toss in infectious disease as if it were a free prize.) This would be offensive if the movie were at all pompous about it and about our need to give the real attacks a thorough pop-culture mulching. But "Cloverfield" is content to be a creature feature; that's what makes it bearable and what keeps it from greatness. The genre, not the script, does the psychological heavy lifting.
Yes, there's a script, written by Drew Goddard, a writer and producer for TV's "Lost" and "Alias." The director, Matt Reeves, has written "Felicity" episodes. All three of those shows were created by J.J. Abrams, the producer of "Cloverfield" and the auteur of its brilliant peekaboo marketing campaign. (The title is supposedly the Department of Defense's codename for the attack; actually, it's the name of the street running outside the movie's Santa Monica production offices. It signifies nothing.)
So there's a TV sensibility here that extends to the glossy young cast and the film's short, sharp running time: a 75-minute gallop from the Paramount logo to the start of the end credits. "Cloverfield" isn't a paradigm-buster the way "Blair Witch" was nine years ago, but it does represent the bending of monster-movie cliches to the shallow new world of reality TV and YouTube.
In other words, the movie is fast, personal, and immediate - or it successfully fakes those qualities - and in so doing blows right over its own story holes. So what if one character takes a steel construction rod through the chest and keeps going? Who cares that Hud would need a battery the size of a Prius to power his camera over the long haul? For that matter, why doesn't he put the damn thing down and make a beeline for Yonkers?
Because it's not really happening unless it's on videotape - any kid will tell you that. "Cloverfield" captures the chronic self-absorption of the Facebook generation with breathless, cleverly recycled media savvy, and then it stomps that self-absorption to death. These days, that's entertainment.


Cloverfield , a surreptitiously subversive, stylistically clever little gem of an entertainment disguised, under its deadpan-neutral title, as a dumb Gen-YouTube monster movie, makes the convincingly chilling argument that the world will end  or, at least, Manhattan will crumble  with a bang and  a whimper. The bang part, as millions who have seen the trailer already know, is supplied by the...thing ...that arises on an otherwise peaceful May night to wreak destruction on New York City: He (She? It?) swats at skyscrapers and smashes NYC landmarks, abetted by tentacled mini-monsters that lunge directly at humans like voracious paparazzi. And when the military arrives to fight back, let's just say the troops opt for the all-out surge approach.
The ineffectual whimper of a handful of nobodies caught in the melee, though, is what's new in the old Godzilla formula  and also what's blackly funny. The doomed Gotham created by producer J.J. Abrams  he with the golden Felicity, Alias,  and Lost  touch  and his team is almost entirely populated by vapid, twenty-something nincompoops. Oops, I mean attractive, indistinguishable young people who handle cell phones, DV cameras, etc., with ease; call one another ''dude''; don't have anything interesting to say; and, perhaps as a result, don't listen to one another, even in an emergency. (The first 20 minutes is a great swath of character-establishing partying, nothing more  a masterstroke of lovingly staged banality.) The acting, by a cast of unknown dudes and dudettes, is appropriately unmemorable. There is, however, a nice simulation of panic as the gang sees the Statue of Liberty's head roll down the street.
Cloverfield  kills its darlings with élan, thanks to the brilliant, post–Blair Witch Project  decision to tell the story through amateur footage shot by one of the refugees  a big-picture disaster seen through the viewfinder of little, self-absorbed people. Here, only airplanes have a chance against the beast, and beauty is useless. Only in New York, kids.

 It was only last month that Will Smith started up boogeyman patrol in Manhattan in “I Am Legend,” and yet here we go again with the end of the world, or at least some of the city’s most exclusive ZIP codes. This time,  the annihilation comes courtesy of a reptilian creature with a slithering, smashing tail, multiple grabby appendages and an apparently insatiable appetite for destruction. At one point in “Cloverfield”  you get a close, very personal look at that hungry mouth, which agape recalls that of the adult monster designed by H. R. Giger for the first “Alien,” though without any of the older beastie’s freakily sexualized menace or resonance.  Like “Cloverfield” itself, this new monster is nothing more than a blunt instrument designed to smash and grab without Freudian complexity or political critique, despite the tacky allusions to Sept. 11. The screams and the images of smoke billowing through the canyons of Lower Manhattan may make you think of the attack, and you may curse the filmmakers for their vulgarity, insensitivity or lack of imagination. (The director, Matt Reeves, lives in Los Angeles, as does the writer, Drew Goddard, and the movie’s star producer, J. J. Abrams.) But the film is too dumb to offend anything except your intelligence, and the monster does cut a satisfying swath through the cast, so your only complaint may be, What took it so long?  As it happens, “Cloverfield” clocks in at 84 minutes, a running time that includes the usual interminable  final credits. The movie moves relatively fast, though it’s nowhere near as economical as its colossus, whose thunderous shrieks and fiery projectiles bring a downtown loft party to a merciful, abrupt end. The loft belongs to a blandly pretty young thing named Rob (Michael Stahl-David), who, on the eve of relocating to Japan for work, has been thrown a farewell party by some other blandly pretty young things. The names we’re meant to remember are those of Rob’s brother, Jason (Mike Vogel), and Jason’s insignificant other, Lily (Jessica Lucas); a bored, boring single, Marlena (Lizzy Caplan); and Rob’s nitwit buddy, Hud (T. J. Miller), who has been recruited to videotape the party.  “Cloverfield” is nominally a monster movie, but mostly it’s a feature-length gimmick. It opens with some official-looking United States government text claiming that the following images were retrieved from what was once known as Central Park. The big (or rather only) idea here is that almost everything we subsequently see is the presumably unedited video material shot by Hud, who, though initially reluctant to pick up the camera, develops a mania for documentation once the monster strikes. So consummate is his dedication to his version of cinéma vérité that he keeps the camera plugged to his eye even while he’s running through hailstorms of debris, trying to cross a fast-collapsing bridge and witnessing friends melt down, bleed out and even die.  For a brief, hopeful moment, I thought the filmmakers might be making a point about how the contemporary compulsion to record the world has dulled us to actual lived experience, including the suffering of others — you know, something about the simulacrum syndrome in the post-Godzilla age at the intersection of the camera eye with the narcissistic “I.” Certainly this straw-grasping seemed the most charitable way to explain characters whose lack of personality (“This is crazy, dude!”) is matched only by their incomprehensible stupidity. Smart as Tater Tots and just as differentiated, Rob and his ragtag crew behave like people who have never watched a monster movie or the genre-savvy “Scream” flicks or even an episode of “Lost” (Hello, Mr. Abrams!), much less experienced the real horrors of Sept. 11.  And, so, much like a character from a crummy movie, Rob hears from an estranged lover, Beth (Odette Yustman), who, after the attack, begs for help on her miraculously working cellphone. Against the odds and a crush of fleeing humanity, he tries to rescue her (unbelievably, ludicrously, the others tag along), which is meant to show what a good guy he is. But heroism without a fully realized hero proves as much a dead end as subjective camerawork that’s executed without a discernible subjectivity.  Like too many big-studio productions, “Cloverfield” works as a showcase for impressively realistic-looking special effects, a realism that fails to extend to the scurrying humans whose fates are meant to invoke pity and fear but instead inspire yawns and contempt.  Rarely have I rooted for a monster with such enthusiasm.    “Cloverfield” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Monster violence and bloody wounds.

An old-fashioned monster movie dressed up in trendy new threads, "Cloverfield" plays like "The Blair Witch Project" meets "Godzilla," as it charts via camcorder the desperate efforts of some twentysomething Soho scenesters to steer clear of a gigantic beast laying waste to Manhattan. Despite its indie-flavored shooting style, first-rate visual effects, reasonable intensity factor, nihilistic attitude and post-9/11 anxiety overlay, this punchy sci-fier is, in the end, not much different from all the marauding creature features that have come before it. But the Paramount release will be lapped up by thrill-seeking young auds everywhere for monstrous initial biz, spurred by an Internet-driven campaign that's been stoking fan interest for months.
The initial teaser that triggered the Web-based anticipation for producer J.J. Abrams' latest creation showed a sexy downtown party being suddenly interrupted by thunderous sounds, and then by the sight of massive urban explosions. The specter of some colossal unknown force destroying life as everyone knows it seemed real and terrifying, especially as it all unfolded a subway stop or two away from the World Trade Center site.
But "Cloverfield" turns out to be less "24" and more "The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms," becoming increasingly comfortable, even reassuring the more you see the actual perpetrator. Nasty as the critter is -- and it does seem to unleash eons' worth of hatred for humanity, although its origins are unspecified -- its very nature as a walking, stalking being suggests it can somehow be killed by conventional means.
So while the film is cleverly and resourcefully made (allegedly for a mere $25 million), as well as both tense and intense, it doesn't provoke sheer terror and never pushes things to the point where you want to look away. Pic aims for a level of emotional involvement, but the characters here have no more substance than they ever do in films constructed around a group of disposable nonentities meant to be methodically reduced in number by a bloodthirsty behemoth.
After some ominous deep rumblings and fleeting reference to an "area formerly known as Central Park," action begins in a high-rise condo overlooking the park, where a young man with a video camera (the date is recorded as April 27) captures the scene of the previous night's romantic fulfillment, as the young lady in question remains sleeping in the early morning light.
Then it's May 22, and preparations are under way for a farewell bash for Rob (Michael Stahl-David

), who, in an undoubted nod to "Godzilla," is leaving for a job in Japan. Before he arrives, Rob's brother Jason (Mike Vogel) records video testimonials from assorted guests, including party babe Lily (Jessica Lucas) and guarded semi-acquaintance Marlena (Lizzy Caplan).
Snippets of conversation reveal Rob has never again contacted Beth (Odette Yustman), the girl from the opening scene, who summarily shows up with another guy -- much to Rob's distress. Just as the emotional steam from this conflict is ready to blow, all hell breaks loose outside and, after viewing the initial devastation from the roof, the vacuous hipsters put the party on hold in favor of saving their skins.
This early action, as the group joins the panicking, confused and injured hordes on the dark streets, where the head of the Statue of Liberty has been unceremoniously dumped, is the best stuff in the picture; something dreadful is out there, but neither we nor the characters have a clue what it is until one of the characters exclaims, "I saw it. It's alive!" Rob, Lily, Marlena and Hud (T.J. Miller), now manning the camera, head for the Brooklyn Bridge, which the beast upends in spectacular fashion while showing a bit of its lizardly monstrousness in the process.
Rob then insists they head uptown to try to save Beth, presumed to be in the high-rise building from the opening scene; Odysseus had an easy time of it compared to what these unprepossessing non-warrior types go through to reach their destination.
Scripter Drew Goddard wisely drops some ancillary beasties into the mix, vicious crab/spider hybrids that make a repellent clicky-clacky noise and are anxious for human snacks. Another effective element is the occasional footage of lovely-dovey Ron and Beth shot back in April, when life looked so promising, the dire events of May 22 being inadvertently recorded over it.
The sights revealed thereafter become increasingly familiar ones to genre fans: decimated cityscapes (pic could even be viewed as a theoretical prequel to "I Am Legend," prepping the city for the way it would look in that recent film), a heavy military presence, an overcrowded temporary hospital, zooming choppers and jets.
At long last, a lingering full-on shot of the monster is served up, and it's not a friendly sight. All the same, a strong argument could be made for not showing the creature at all. The film's initial hints at offering a new kind of horror eventually devolve into something essentially familiar, provoking idle thoughts that, in the vein of the '50s sci-fier "Forbidden Planet," it could have been more effective with an invisible but quite tangible threat.
Handheld style overseen by director Matt Reeves, whose first feature was "The Pallbearer" and who partnered with Abrams on "Felicity" for four years, produces mixed results; the frenzied, haphazard nature of the coverage accurately reflects the state of things, but also seems hackneyed from overuse. A major production benefit must have been that expenditures for visual effects (expertly handled by Double Negative and the Tippett Studio) could be minimized, as the camera could plausibly be pointed away from the action much of the time.
Picture proper only runs 73 minutes, while the end credits crawl up the screen in what seems like slow motion for 12 minutes to eke out a total running time of 85 minutes. Only source music is used in the film itself, but accompanying the credits is "Roar! (Cloverfield Overture)," which composer Michael Giacchino has cleverly fashioned to evoke the sort of bombastic, heavily dramatic score such a picture would have had in traditional times.
If "Cloverfield" proves massively successful, there's nothing preventing this beast from invading as many other cities as the public wants to see destroyed.

I dont understand why this is happening, whimpers an awestruck participant in the Cloverfield  calamity. Quaking amidst the rubble of shattered condos, stumbling over piles of decimated retail, choking on burnt flesh and smoldering plastic, witness to the collapse of proud Manhattan real estate in the wake of implacable, inexplicable fury, she really ought to have said, I dont understand why this is happening again .
TV auteur J.J. Abrams  may have played coy with the marketing campaign for his ultra-mysterious, mega-hyped monster movie, but now that the thing looms fully into sightwhoa its clear he isnt beating around the Bush-era iconography. Street-level 9/11 footage would fit seamlessly into Cloverfield s hand-held, ersatz-amateur POV; the initial onslaught of mayhem, panic, plummeting concrete, and toxic avalanches could have been storyboarded directly from the CNN  archive. Cloverfield never stops to identify the why, whence, or whereto of its rampaging meaniethis relentless thriller stops for nothingbut as for what to call it, behold . . . al-Qaedzilla!
And how delicious that it comes to feast on the neo-yuppies. Cloverfield  devotes the first 20 of its 73-minute runtime to a partyHOLY SHIT. Stop. Let me write that again: 73-MINUTE RUNTIME. Can we just take a moment to pause the action, set aside our differences, drop all beefs, join together as one, and give thanks, all praise due, shout joy to the world and hey, hallelujahsomething has found us! Something that isnt three fucking hours long!
As I was saying, the neo-yuppies. Cloverfield  enacts its deft simulation of that infamous September morning in order to brutalize the society that flourished from its ruin like some tacky, tenacious, condo-dwelling fungus. The movie opens in the giant downtown loft of Rob (Michael Stahl-David ), a fuckable, upwardly mobile, exceptionally boring twentysomething VP of some white-collar soul-suck. Recently promoted to the Japan  office, and tenderly besotted with a Central Park  West banality named Beth (Odette Yustman ), Rob grins open his front door to the cheers and cameras of a surprise going-away party comprised of fellow smug, self-entitled whitest-kids-you-know.
The narrative conceit of the movie is that were watching a certain quantity of consumer-grade video retrieved by the government from the area formerly known as Central Park after an incident code-named Cloverfield. Plying a sly twist on this Blair Witch craft, director Matt Reeves  devises a meta-cross-cutting strategy: The main story, largely shot by a wiseass meathead named Hud (T.J. Miller ), alternates via camera glitching with the original footage on the tape. This shows us Rob and Beth falling semi-plausibly in lurv while day-tripping to Coney Island . That, in toto, is the motivation for the swift, brutish thrust of the movie: Rob & Co.s absurdly ill-advised odyssey to save Beth, wounded in her midtown high-rise, as all manner of giant-lizard, military-reprisal, angry-insectoid-parasite hell breaks loose.
This latter menace, a breed of vicious, super-charged, spider-like descendants of the Bugs from Starship Troopers , provides Cloverfield  a nifty guerrilla threat. Shaken loose from the hide of al-Qaedzilla as he howls through the city, they pop up willy-nilly to deliver short, uncontrolled bursts of back-slashing, toxin-injecting, mega-hemorrhaging terror. Their introduction speaks to Cloverfield s chief excellence: a shrewd, scary, playful sense of scale that locks the action in place and propels it forward whiplash fast.
Aside from an apparent space-time rift in the uptown No. 6 tunnel granting an impossibly convenient jaunt from Spring Street to 59th, the movie keeps faith with Manhattan reality. The specificity stings: a breathless regrouping hilariously staged in front of the upscale cosmetic emporium Sephora ; a frantic emergence from a subway-tunnel nightmare into the over-lit horror of a triage center in Bloomingdales; an acknowledgement that the Time Warner Center  at Columbus Circle  is, indeed, a very deep circle of hell.
With its emphasis on corporate infrastructure and the unimaginative consumer class that enables it, Cloverfield  makes for a most satisfying death-to-New-York saga. Which is to say, the fatal flaw of Drew Goddard s scriptshallow, unlikable heroescan be flipped to an asset: death to the shallow, unlikable heroes! Cynical, sure, but in any case the movie doesnt belong to its writer, but to the macro-vision of Abrams as executed with micro-dexterity by his team. Michael Bonvillains cinematography is a tour de force of avid FXladen pseudo-verité. Coupled with Kevin Stitts complex cutting, Cloverfield  is a sustained triumph of expanding and contracting perspectives, its whip-pans from human-scale panic to skyscraper-toppling spectacle raising the bar set by Spielbergs War of the Worlds if not Sokurovs Russian Ark .
The mechanism is the message in Cloverfield , a movie so aluminum-sleek, ultra-portable, and itsy-bitsy sexy, its amazing Steve Jobs  didnt pull it out of an envelope at Macworld .
