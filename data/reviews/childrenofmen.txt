The end of the world is upon us in the grim and grimy future-London of Alfonso Cuarón's "Children of Men." Illegal immigrants are locked in big cages that sit on sidewalks. The streets are war zones (it looks as if the Blitz came back). And even more urgent, women not too long ago lost the capacity to reproduce naturally. A child hasn't been born in 19 years and, in the film's harrowing opening minutes, it's reported that Earth's last-born son has died in a terrorist bombing. The world might go on, but it appears that we will not.
This is an extraordinary artistic breakthrough from a Mexican director who was already fearlessly good to begin with. His contribution to the "Harry Potter" franchise dared to mix an element of real-world wickedness into J.K. Rowling's fantasy. "Children of Men" uses science-fiction to show us what we stand to become, if not how we actually are.
Cuarón suggests that a planet mired in apocalypse is even more doomed without hope of children. It's dumber, too: Violence and hostility rage on, as if mankind is in a rush to finish itself off. Taken from a 14-year-old P.D. James book and brilliantly refashioned by the director and four other screenwriters (when have so many scribes ever produced a movie this good?), "Children of Men" pushes yesterday's and today's moral quagmires and human atrocities into the not-too-distant future. (The film is set in 2027, and that's closer than you think.)
In Cuarón's visionary refraction of now, this London is Camp X-Ray, Abu Ghraib , Baghdad, Beirut, Detroit, the seething id of a paranoid, polluted Western dystopia. In Cuarón's allegory, this is the sort of fascist nightmare that world leaders say they're trying to protect us from.
People still go to work, ride the bus, and throw away money at the dog tracks. Amid this bleak normalcy, there may be a glimmer of hope. One afternoon a gang of masked thugs plucks Theo (Clive Owen) off the streets and takes him to their leader, an imposing woman with pellucid skin and an opaque agenda. Her name is Julian, she is played by Julianne Moore, and she used to be Theo's girlfriend and partner in leftist crime. They were part of an activist human-rights organization called the Fishes, and they haven't seen each other in the two decades since their baby died in a flu pandemic. Now she needs his help. It seems a young black refugee named Kee ( Clare-Hope Ashitey) needs travel permits that Theo can help get her.
Owen plays his character as a gathering headwind of disbelief and determination. The film's fraught atmosphere intensifies as Theo finds himself drawn into a grand Fish cabal that includes the ever sturdy Chiwetel Ejiofor. And in one divine sequence we discover why. Kee summons Theo into a barn and reveals her pregnant belly. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera dotes on the image, and well it should. Cuarón has given us a live Renaissance painting by way of the Saatchi Gallery: Black Madonna with Child. Suddenly, the audience and Theo know what's at stake. A boat called the Tomorrow is arriving to take her to a group that's planning a new society, and it falls to Theo to get her there.
Before the breathtaking hell of that journey, there's a restorative layover at the woodland cottage of Theo's jaundice-haired stoner friend Jasper, who's played by Michael Caine in a splendid Richard Harris impersonation. Jasper is a New Age crackpot, but Cuarón is on his side, letting us see him care for his wife, who was left catatonic after being tortured by the police. "Shanti, shanti," he exclaims, 
at one point, invoking the Hindu word for peace.
Naturally, that's nowhere to be found. Theo's cousin (Danny Huston) has managed to get his hands on an assortment of art treasures. In a downright Kubrickian joke, Michelangelo's David stands in his foyer with a prosthetic leg, and outside his window floats Pink Floyd's flying pig, but the pièce-de-résistance is Picasso's enormous war-epic, "Guernica," which hovers in the background of a few shots. In the picture's last act, Cuarón builds his own version of Picasso's masterpiece in a bravura sequence set at a refugee camp that's as big and lethally harsh as some Third World countries. The place erupts into combat once the Fishes break in and ignite a revolt.
Throughout "Children of Men," Cuarón offers affectionate moments: the house pets that cling to Theo, Ashitey's inextinguishable jocularity, and the superb Peter Mullan as a friendly guard at that camp. But in that battle sequence, the violence grinds mercilessly on, so hard in fact that, during an extended sequence, dots of blood remain splattered on the camera lens. It's not simply Cuarón's ideas that make this movie great -- other filmmakers have been similarly dismayed by these times. It's the audaciousness of his execution.
"Children of Men" has a blistering immediacy that's singular in this age of rapid cutting. Along with Alex Rodríguez, Cuarón cut the picture himself, and while he uses digital effects as enrichment, he builds scenes within the camera's frame rather than just in an editing room. So the film is as theatrical as it is cinematic.
Filmed almost entirely with handheld cameras and desaturated of bright color, the movie looks and feels like something that was made decades ago: a gloomy rock opera or "A Clockwork Orange." For the occasion, Cuarón has even acquired Kubrick's appetite for dark materials -- up to a point. The film feels like a tribute to the late director's ruthlessness and delight in visual surprise. But Cuarón isn't the nihilist Kubrick was. Despite all the destruction in "Children of Men," he manages to say something Kubrick never had the heart to: Shanti, shanti!


         The best science fiction talks about the future to talk about the now, and "Children of Men" very much belongs in that class. Made with palpable energy, intensity and excitement, it compellingly creates a world gone mad that is uncomfortably close to the one we live in. It is a "Blade Runner" for the 21st century, a worthy successor to that epic of dystopian decay.
 
  Like that earlier film, "Children of Men" is based on a novel (P.D. James this time, not Philip K. Dick) and deals with the question of the future of human life. It brings so much urgency to the possibility of the world ending that we feel the kind of terror we would if the scenario were taking place tomorrow instead of 20 years in the future.
 


         






    Also, in Alfonso Cuarón, "Children of Men" has a strong director with a powerhouse visual sense who is at home with both action sequences and philosophical concerns. Cuarón, with such widely diverse films as "A Little Princess" and "Y Tu Mamá También" behind him, demonstrates once again that no genre is beyond his mastery.
 
  The plot hook of "Children of Men" is simple but devastating: the infertility of the entire human race. The date is 2027, and it's been 18 years since the Earth's last human child was born. James, whose novel has been altered considerably by the film's five credited screenwriters, says she wrote it to answer the question, "If there were no future, how would we behave?" The answer, in a word, is horribly.
 
  For what "Children of Men" shows us is a world coming apart at the seams. Britain, where the story is set, has survived by becoming a chaotic police state in which rioters fueled by pure fury attack whatever moves and heavily armed police and savage dogs keep a close eye on ever-present refugees stuffed into sidewalk holding tanks. "Renouncers" flog themselves for the forgiveness of humanity, public service ads insist "The world has collapsed, only Britain soldiers on," and an underground group called the Fishes fights for equal rights for that flood of immigrants.
 
  This, again like "Blade Runner," is an undeniably pulpy premise, but two things elevate "Children of Men": One is the sheer forcefulness of the storytelling, the other the film's brilliant visual look and style.
 
  The story line here is again quite simple. A disheartened bureaucrat named Theo (Clive Owen, master of the disillusioned look) has cut himself off from most human contact except for an old friend and hippie drug dealer named Jasper (Michael Caine in a way we've not seen him before).
 
  This all changes when Theo comes face to face with Julian (Julianne Moore), his old flame who turns out to be part of the leadership of the Fishes. She and her lieutenant, Chiwetel Ejiofor's Luke, want his help in procuring exit visas for a young refugee woman named Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey). It will surprise no one who has noticed "Children of Men" is opening on Christmas Day that, astonishingly, Kee is with child.
 
  Theo reluctantly agrees to help, and all kinds of unexpected complications follow in the wake of that decision. Everyone has agendas within agendas, and even simple notions, like the importance of getting Kee to safety, turn out to mean different things to different people. And, because of Kee's urgent condition, every decision is taken under the ever-higher pressure of increasingly dire time constraints.
 
  The critical factor in helping keep that tension at a high pitch, critical in getting us to take seriously what could be a lurid premise, is Cuarón's skill in not only motivating his actors but also in creating such a ferocious sense of forward momentum that everything feels more real — and more terrifying — than would seem possible.
 
  Essential here is exceptional work by production designers Jim Clay and Geoffrey Kirkland, who create a world of garbage and decay that looks both contemporary and futuristic. Most remarkable of all is what Cuarón's longtime director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki has accomplished by shooting entirely hand-held with few lights, greatly increasing the film's verisimilitude. Although everyone will notice the bravura work of camera operator George Richmond during one continuous seven-minute-plus battle scene, the skill of the cinematography team carries the film from the beginning to the end.
 
  Perhaps most delicate of all is the way director Cuarón has made "Children of Men" comment on the problems society faces today, crises involving racism, terrorism, decaying infrastructure, threatened environment, government-inspired paranoia and more.
 
  This is a world of rubble, fear and hopelessness whose connections to our own are never forced; Cuarón is such a fluid director with such a powerful imagination, they don't have to be. This could well be our future, and we know it.

 The end is nigh in “Children of Men,” the superbly directed political thriller by Alfonso Cuarón about a nervously plausible future. It’s 2027, and the human race is approaching the terminus of its long goodbye. Cities across the globe are in flames, and the “siege of Seattle” has entered Day 1,000. In a permanent war zone called Britain, smoke pours into the air as illegal immigrants are swept into detainment camps. It’s apocalypse right here, right now  —  the end of the world as we knew and loved it, if not nearly enough.  Based in broad outline on the 1992 dystopian novel by P. D. James about a world suffering from global infertility  —  and written with a nod to Orwell by Mr. Cuarón and his writing partner Timothy J. Sexton along with David Arata, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby  —  “Children of Men” pictures a world that looks a lot like our own, but darker, grimmer and more frighteningly, violently precarious. It imagines a world drained of hope and defined by terror in which bombs regularly explode in cafes crowded with men and women on their way to work. It imagines the unthinkable: What if instead of containing Iraq, the world has become Iraq, a universal battleground of military control, security zones, refugee camps and warring tribal identities?  Merry Christmas! Seriously. “Children of Men” may be something of a bummer, but it’s the kind of glorious bummer that lifts you to the rafters, transporting you with the greatness of its filmmaking. Like Clint Eastwood’s “Letters From Iwo Jima,” another new film that holds up a mirror to these times, Mr. Cuarón’s speculative fiction is a gratifying sign that big studios are still occasionally  in the business of making ambitious, intelligent work that speaks to adults. And much like Mr. Eastwood’s most recent war movie, much like the best  genre films of Hollywood history, “Children of Men” doesn’t announce its themes from a bully pulpit, with a megaphone in hand and Oscar in mind, but through the beauty of its form.  It may seem strange, even misplaced to talk of beauty given the horror of the film’s explosive opening. For Theo, the emotionally, physically enervated employee of the Ministry  of Energy played without a shred of actorly egotism by Clive Owen, the day begins with a cup of coffee, an ear-shattering explosion and a screaming woman holding her severed arm. The Mexican-born Mr. Cuarón, whose previous credits include the children’s films “A Little Princess” (1995) and “Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban” (2004), as well as the supremely sexy road movie “Y Tu Mamá También” (2001), has always had a dark streak. But nothing in his résumé prepares you for the shocking realism of this explosion, which proves all the more terrible because here it is also so very commonplace.  Britain, it emerges, is in permanent lockdown. As the specter of humanity’s end looms, the world has been torn apart by sectarian violence. Britain has closed its borders (the Chunnel too), turning illegal aliens into Public Enemy No. 1. Theo and the other gray men and women adrift in London don’t seem to notice much.  Everywhere there are signs and warnings, surveillance cameras and security patrols. “The world has collapsed,” a public service announcement trumpets, “only Britain soldiers on.” The verb choice is horribly apt, since heavily armed soldiers are ubiquitous. They flank the streets and train platforms, guarding the pervasive  metal cages crammed with a veritable Babel of humanity, illegal immigrants who have fled to Britain from  hot spots, becoming refugees  or “fugees” for short.  Among the fugees is Kee (Clare-Hope Ashitey), the linchpin of the story and its defiantly hopeful heart because she’s pregnant, the first woman on earth to carry a child after 18 barren years. Theo meets Kee through his former lover, Julian (Julianne Moore), the leader of an underground cadre, the Fishes  (Chiwetel Ejiofior and Charlie Hunnam, among others),   who, having renounced violence if not their heavy guns or lugubrious rhetoric, are fighting for immigrant rights.  Avowedly apolitical, Theo agrees to help the Fishes deliver Kee into the ministering care of a shadowy, perhaps apocryphal utopian group, the Human Project. En route, though, the plan goes violently awry, forcing Theo, Kee and a Fish member and former midwife, Miriam (Pam Ferris), to go on the run, first by car and then by foot.  Where they eventually land is in a hell that looks chillingly similar to the Iraqi combat areas  of newspaper reportage, television news and mostly uncensored  documentaries. There are several heart-gripping set pieces before then, including a hugely unsettling ambush scene shot  almost entirely from   inside a car crammed with passengers.  The action is swift, ferocious, spectacularly  choreographed, with bodies careening wildly amid a fusillade of bullets and flying  glass. Yet what lingers isn’t the technical virtuosity; it’s that after the car screeches off, Mr. Cuarón’s camera quietly lingers behind to show us two dead policemen, murdered in the name of an ideal and left like road kill. He forces us to look at the unspeakable and in doing so opens up a window onto the film’s moral landscape.  “Children of Men” has none of the hectoring qualities that tend to accompany good intentions in Hollywood. Most of the people doing the preaching turn out to be dreadfully, catastrophically misguided; everyone else seems to be holding on, like Theo’s friend Jasper (Michael Caine, wonderful), a former political cartoonist  who bides his time with laughter and a lot of homegrown weed  while listening to Beatles covers and rap. Still others, like Theo’s wealthy cousin, Nigel (Danny Huston, equally fine), who’s stashing away masterpieces like Michelangelo’s “David” for safekeeping in his private museum while Rome, New York and probably Guernica burn, can only smile as they swill another glass of wine. Hope isn’t the only thing that floats, as a song on the soundtrack reminds us.  The writer Kurt Andersen  observed not long ago that we Americans are in an apocalyptic frame of mind. Mr. Andersen thinks that the latest in apocalypticism partly owes something to the aging baby boomers confronting their own impending doom,   Sept. 11 and global warming notwithstanding. That’s one way to look at it, though the recent elections suggest that more than a few of those boomers are looking past their own reflection out at the world. Working with his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki, Mr. Cuarón manufactures war zones of extraordinary plausibility in this film, but equally amazing is how, through a carbon-blue palette, handheld camerawork and the sag of a man’s shoulders, he conjures the hopelessness and the despair that I imagine many of us feel when we wake up to news of another fatal car bombing in Iraq.  There are, Mr. Cuarón suggests in “Children of Men,” different ways of waking up. You can either wake up and close your ears and eyes, or like Theo you can wake up until all your senses are roaring. Early in the film Theo and the restlessly moving camera seem very much apart, as Mr. Cuarón keeps a distance from the characters.  Every so often the camera pointedly drifts away from Theo, as it does with the dead policemen, to show us a weeping old woman locked in a cage or animals burning on pyres. In time, though, the camera comes closer to Theo as he opens his eyes — to a kitten crawling up his leg, to trees rustling in the wind — until, in one of the most astonishing scenes of battle I’ve ever seen on film, it is running alongside him, trying to keep pace with a man who has finally  found a reason to keep going.  “Children of Men” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film contains extremely intense scenes of warfare.
History repeats itself: 11 Decembers ago, Universal had the season's strongest moviea downbeat sci-fi flick freely adapted from a well-known source by a name director. With a bare minimum of advance screenings and a total absence of hype, the studio dumped it. This year, they've done it again.
The 1995 castoff was 12 Monkeys , Terry Gilliam 's remake of Chris Marker 's La Jetée ; this year's victim is Children of Men , Alfonso Cuarón 's dank, hallucinated, shockingly immediate version of P.D. James 's novel. Never mind that Cuarón saved the Harry Potter   franchise and, with Y Tu Mamá También , directed the highest-grossing Spanish-language movie ever released in America (or that Children of Men  was respectfully received at the Venice Film Festival  and topped the British box office the week that it opened), this superbly crafted action thriller is being treated like a communicable disease.
Ever sensitive to buzz, critics have gotten the message and are steering clear. When the New York Film Critics Circle  met last week, Children of Men  got only a handful of votes, mainly for Emmanuel Lubezki 's sensational cinematography. Earlier this month, The New York Times   imagined Academy members in surgical scrubs, with a "news analysis" noting the unusual goriness of the year's Oscar contenders: The Departed , Flags of Our Fathers , Blood Diamond , Apocalypto , and The Last King of Scotland . A more resonant and gripping movie than any of these, Children of Men  wasn't even mentioned.
This despite the vivid Fleet Street terror bombing that establishes London 202 7, the jolting, bloody car chaseshot in what looks like a single takethat eliminates one of the stars, and the year's most brilliantly choreographed action sequence. Children of Men vaults into another dimension with one more long-shot tour de force as Clive Owen 's protagonist dashes from a nightmare prison camp through an urban free-fire zone, cradling a newborn baby. (Not since John Woo 's Hard Boiled has an infant been put in such egregious harm's way.)
With five screenwriters (Cuarón included), it's impossible to give credit for the intelligent path Children of Men  takes through James's 1992 novel, preserving while enriching her allegorical premise. Humanity is facing its own extinctionnot through nuclear proliferation or global warming, but the end of fertility. Like James's book, the movie opens with the violent death of the world's youngest person (18-year-old "Baby Diego," stabbed by an irate fan in Buenos Aires ) and imagines what might happen if the human race were granted a miraculous second chance. Universal may have deemed Children of Men too grim for Christmas, but it is premised on a reverence for life that some might term religious.
The year is 2027 but the mood is late 1940. "The world has collapsed," a BBC  newsreader explains. "Only Britain soldiers on"barely. The U.K. is a mecca for illegal immigrants, as well as a bastion of neo-fascist homeland security. London's smog-shrouded smear of garbage, graffiti, and motorcycle rickshaws is the shabbiest of havens. Armed cops are ubiquitous, and refugeesor 'fugeesare locked up in curbside cages. Religious cultists parade through the streets. Terrorists and looters control the despoiled landscape poignantly dotted with long-abandoned schools.
Enormously sympathetic, as always, Owen plays a wry and rumpled jokerless an actual character than a nexus of connections. His ex-wife (Julianne Moore ) is an underground revolutionary; his buddy (Michael Caine ) is a scene-stealing old hippie with a secret house in the woods. He has a well-off cousin in the government (Danny Huston ) who lives in what looks like a South Bank power station amid recovered artworks, including Michelangelo's David  (missing a leg) and Picasso 's Guernica , and no longer worries about tomorrow. Owen's warmth is such that everyone trusts him, including animals and a mysterious young woman (Clare-Hope Ashitey ) who needs to be smuggled through the countryside.
It's a measure of Cuarón's directorial chops that Children of Men functions equally well as fantasy and thriller. Like Spielberg's War of the Worlds and the Wachowski Brothers ' V for Vendetta (and more consistently than either), the movie attempts to fuse contemporary life with pulp mythology. The war against terror and the battle in Iraq  are most powerfully present in the aforementioned set piece where Owen escapes a nightmare Gitmo  into the exploding rubble of an incipient Fallujah . Children of Men doesn't entirely elude a sentimental tinge. (I've heard it called a disaster film for NPR  subscribers.) But scenes that express the solace of solidarity or the fragility of human life are viscerally bleak, when not totally brutal.
Infertility is but a metaphor that enables Children of Men  to entertain the possibility of No Future. The only parents these days who assume their children will inhabit a better world are either those living in the gated communities of the super-rich or the immigrants imported to tend their gardens. That these 'fugees are visualized as the persecuted rabble of a crumbling empire is only one of this movie's inconvenient truths.
