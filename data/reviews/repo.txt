What could be more suited to the classic operatic format than a cyber-gothic story of family treachery, clandestine drug-running, and the age-old quest for eternal beauty? Not much, I'll give you that, and Repo! The Genetic Opera
 � while not to everyone's tastes, to be sure � is a hugely ambitious affair, chock-full of love and death, hideously disfigured trickery, and foolhardy fathers who love their daughters to death � and quite possibly beyond. It even has Ogre, of industrial-rock icon Skinny Puppy, wearing someone else's face: It's Shakespeare in the Too Dark Park. Set in a 21st century America devastated by a mysterious plague that causes sudden organ failure, Repo!
 follows the appropriately scandalous and sordid story of GeneCo, a family-run medical dynasty that allows the surviving citizenry the chance not only to survive their internal combustion but to engineer new bodies and faces (if not always minds). As a commentary on human vanity, Repo!
 is witheringly dead-on; as a full-fledged opera, it's somewhat less memorable but still well worth checking out if you're in the mood for some pseudo-Rocky Horror
 theatrics. And Repo!
 is nada if not theatrical in the extreme. It makes the recent Sweeney Todd
 seem like a model of upstanding civic and social behavior. As befits its operatic origins, Repo!
's plot is as twisted as the gooshy loops of human intestines which frequently litter the screen. Spy Kids
' Vega is teen gothling Shilo Wallace, a black-bewigged sufferer of an unknown pathogen who finds her life constrained by her father, Nathan (Buffy the Vampire Slayer
's Head), who has forbidden her to leave the grounds of the dark and dreary family manse. Dear old dad has a double identity, however. He's also the organ Repo Man, a serial vivisectionist clandestinely employed by the corrupt head of GeneCo, the aptly named Rotti Largo (Sorvino, exuberantly devouring his role along with most of the scenery). Recently diagnosed with an unnamed terminal illness, Rotti is loathe to bequeath his beloved GeneCo to his psychopathic offspring (among them Hilton and The Devil's Rejects
' Moseley). Instead, he schemes to lure the innocent Shilo from her father's clutches and into his own. To reveal more would be to deprive you of half the pleasure of Repo!
, i.e., the sheer, disorienting melodramatics of all these nefarious goings-on. While Repo!
 is hardly perfect � barely a day after seeing it I can hardly recall a single song, of which there are many � the film boasts some deliciously gothic set design, and the entire cast seems to be having the time of their lives (and deaths). It's not often you come across a film as unique as this, and while my taste for liver, lights, and sweetbreads isn't what it once was, this is still a fine post-Halloween aperitif, with guts to spare.

Spy Kids ' Vega plays a bedridden teen unaware that her creepily doting father (Anthony Stewart Head) spends evenings messily ''repossessing'' organs at the behest of biotech mogul Sorvino in Repo! The Genetic Opera . And it's an opera. Cue Paris Hilton, industrial-rock din, spinal extractions, Victorian furnishings (velvet curtains, bustiers, birdcages), soprano Sarah Brightman, and the nihilism and desaturated colors of post-Seven horror films. If steampunk bloodbaths aren't for you, it's a long wait for the fat lady to sing.

 Darren Lynn Bousman, the director of several “Saw” sequels, has devised an excruciating new torture with “Repo! The Genetic Opera.” Set about 50 years hence, this high-concept, tone-deaf musical imagines a dystopian society afflicted by widespread organ failure, biological black markets and spontaneous outbreaks of painfully monotonous rock ’n’ roll.  Adapted from a theater production with lyrics and music by Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich, “Repo!” feels destined to please a campy coterie of fans and no one else. Granted, there is a measure of originality in conceiving a horror-inflected rock opera on scientific and political themes, and no film starring Paris Hilton as a marginalized heiress whose poorly grafted face slides clean off her skull is entirely without its guilty pleasures.  But when you live by the song,  you die by the song. A few catchy melodies, some clever lyrics or even a sense that the score wasn’t just one long, unmodulated track might have energized this singularly inert tale of a young girl (Alexa Vega) seeking answers to the nature of her peculiar genetic disease and the strange history of  an Orwellian biotech firm named GeneCo.  “Repo! The Genetic Opera” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for violence.

If the concept of the midnight movie weren't moldering in its grave, "Repo! The Genetic Opera" would be cutting-edge fare for the latenight crowd; one can almost hear the aud's partisan cheering for different internal organs, depending on what is being eviscerated at any particular moment. Pet project by Darren Lynn Bousman (who helmed the second, third and fourth "Saw" movies) is a bloody mess, saddled with a score that suggests Stephen Sondheim joined Blue Oyster Cult. But the Nov. 7 Lionsgate release will be a good time for the very strong of stomach.
Based on screenwriters Darren Smith and Terrance Zdunich's stage tuner, which Bousman directed in Los Angeles several years ago, "Repo! The Genetic Opera" is so over-the-top it's purple. At the same time, it's not too many lengths of intestine beyond some mainstream movies, "Sweeney Todd" being the most obvious comparison. In fact, while "Repo!" is set in a futuristic world where replacement organs can be bought -- and repossessed, if you're late on the payments -- it otherwise fits quite snugly into a "Todd" template.
There's the guilt-wracked, blade-wielding principal, Nathan (Anthony Stewart Head, of TV's "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"), a scientist convinced he was responsible for his wife's death and the illness of his only child, Shilo (Alexa Vega, of "Spy Kids").
There's a truly black-hearted villain, Rotti Largo (Paul Sorvino) -- owner of GeneCo, the world's leader in human replacement parts -- who has manipulated Nathan into becoming Repo Man, Rotti's collector of bad debts and the occasional kidney. Abetted by his demented sons, Luigi (a venomous Bill Moseley) and the mask-wearing Pavi (Nivek Ogre of the band Skinny Puppy), Rotti is evil incarnate, manipulates everyone, and isn't a bad singer.
Shilo is the emotional center of the film, the innocent who is somehow unsoiled by the dementia rampant in her universe, and Vega gives it her all. The same can be said for all the cast -- including Paris Hilton, who delivers a limited but thoroughly appropriate performance in a movie in which almost everything is inappropriate. All the players throw themselves into their parts, so to speak, and given the limited amount of direction going on here, this is probably Bousman's biggest accomplishment.
This full-blown enthusiasm extends to the movie's most eccentric bit of casting, Sarah Brightman (Andrew Lloyd Webber's ex, best known for playing Christine in "The Phantom of the Opera"), who, as the mysterious Blind Mag, is the most operatic element in this genetic opera.
Bousman has created a world limited by the story's stage roots, and, no doubt, by its budget, but he creates a unified whole within a very untidy realm. Would that the music were more memorable: A Sondheim reference isn't entirely unwarranted -- much of the sung narrative is atonal, but it's also unremarkable. The best number is performed by co-writer Zdunich, who, as the ghoulish Grave Robber, may be the pic's most engaging character, despite his unpleasant occupation: The painkiller used in organ transplants can be harvested from the dead, it seems. And Grave Robber is really into recycling.

Movie cults are born, not made. A youthful audience discovered Donnie Darko   on its own, even as another demographic transformed The Sound of Music  into sing-along karaoke—to name two of the 21st century's more notorious cult attractions. Still, no less than rocket science, show business relies on tested formulae—hence Repo! The Genetic Opera .
A week late for Halloween and 31 years after The Rocky Horror Picture Show  first attracted press attention to the costumed, cross-dressing hordes descending each weekend on the old Waverly (now the IFC Center ), Repo!  arrives, wearing the cloak of midnight madness—not to mention black lipstick, cut-rate rococo threads, and all the accoutrements for life in a blasted necropolis.
Based on a campy sci-fi/horror rock opera first staged in Toronto in 2002, Repo!  is also an offshoot of the slash-mash-gash Saw  franchise that's made gazillions for Lionsgate—it's directed by Darren Lynn Bousman , youthful helmer of Saw s II , III , and IV . No diabolical torture machines here, unless you read Repo!  as a cautionary essay on the perils of the credit economy. Bousman's moderately gory cabinet of curiosities opens with a comic-book explication of its particular world. A half-century on, humanity has been decimated by a plague and gone surgery-mad, with desperate survivors buying replacement internal organs from the GeneCo on credit. Then as now, people are liable to default—with scalpel-wielding repo men chasing down deadbeats to reclaim the company's transplants.
Two interlocking family dramas are played out amid the murky clutter of exploitable bodies. A brooding Sweeney Todd type (Anthony Stewart Head ) does GeneCo's bloody business in order to provide medicine for his sickly goth-girl daughter (Alexa Vega ). Meanwhile, the unscrupulous plutocratic head of GeneCo (Paul Sorvino ) attempts to rule his spiritually or physically degenerate offspring—among them Paris Hilton , who, in her big number, appears as a degenerate Marie Antoinette  before her face dissolves.
Repo!  is a movie of wildly enthusiastic Grand Guignol gross-outs. One GeneCo minion makes his entrance bellowing, "Well, who ordered pizza—I could go for a SLICE!!!!" It's also entirely sung through, mainly in a persistent belting whine. (The crooning corpses got a big laugh at the screening I attended.) Little Alexa Vega has a lively number, bounding from her sickbed to proclaim herself punkishly "Seventeen," accompanied by a teddy-bear chorus. And pop diva Sarah Brightman  is on hand to accompany her number with holographic phantoms projected from her spooked-up peepers.
Jeepers creepers: The whole gaudy miasma reaches its climax with the entire cast converging on the local opera house, West Side Story –style. ("Tonight, tonight, we'll be at the opera tonight—it's gonna be a bloodbath—toni-i-i-i-ght!") This is Brightman's big scene, and Phantom of the Opera  notwithstanding, Andrew Lloyd Webber 's erstwhile muse has never seemed more in her element. Singing an Italian aria in fake snow, she blinds herself at the end to wind up impaled on the set before Vega, gathering her forces in a paroxysm of petulance, clobbers the mysterious masked man who might be her dad. "Someone tell me what's going on—tell me!" she pleads. ("Tell her! Tell her!" the crowd agrees.)
The grim finality of the ensuing pietà suggests the last act of Hamlet  or, rather, Hamlet 2 —so embarrassing that, for the first time, I wanted to avert my eyes from the screen, although that might have also been because Repo!  appears to have been shot with a cell phone.
