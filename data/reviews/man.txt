"Do you know how powerful the human bite is?" asks the nerdy dental supplies salesman to the hard-boiled cop. Do you know some movies can bite even harder? "The Man" is 83 minutes of flatulence-perfumed proof.
Oh, now, that's a little unfair, isn't it? The wonderful mono-browed comedian Eugene Levy has built up a reservoir of pop-culture good will that stretches from "SCTV" back in the '80s to "A Mighty Wind" in 2003, with his portrayal of "Jim's Dad" in the "American Pie" movies a deserved mainstream windfall. And Samuel L. Jackson has made some curious career choices, certainly ("Formula 51," we speak your name), but he is as reliable a smart, snarling tough guy as there is currently working.
They are, in short, professionals, and here they wring every last ounce of mustard out of a rancid boardwalk hotdog. Nice try, but "The Man" still tastes dreadful.
Jackson is Derrick Vann, a Detroit-based federal agent in the bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, and criminals have just stolen a major stockpile of guns, killing Vann's crooked partner in the process. The agent arranges a sting and sets up a meeting with the chief villain, a natty British hoodlum named Joey (Luke Goss), at a downtown diner. Major snafu: Andy Fidler (Levy), in town from Wisconsin to speak at a dental supplies convention, enters the diner and is mistaken by the bad guys for the shadowy arms buyer.
That's pretty much the plot. The rest is Andy and Vann screeching around Motor City in Vann's Caddy while the white guy natters and the black dude stews. A few more bodies turn up, and every so often Vann pauses to beat local snitch Booty (Anthony Mackie) over the head with a phone book. Off on the sidelines are Vann's boss, Lieutenant Carbone (comedian Susie Essman, doing nothing particularly funny), and an internal affairs cop (Miguel Ferrer) who wants the agent's head on a plate. Whenever the pace flags, director Les Mayfield and his screenwriters break out the fart jokes, and let me tell you, that's a lot of fart jokes. The family behind me at the preview screening roared in delight whenever Andy's bowels rumbled, so obviously there's an audience for this sort of thing. You know who you are.
"The Man" is a junkyard dog of a movie, but when it lets Levy and Jackson trade barbs, some laughs do squeak out. Early on, Andy lectures Vann with suburban priggishness about his swearing and suggests he replace one particular epithet with the phrase "Fuhh . . . crying out loud." This comes in handy when the agent visits his estranged wife and daughter, a scene so unexpectedly tender it's like finding a love letter in a bordello. Later, when Andy gets cocky in his role as Vann's partner, Levy plays him as strutting King Geek, and the bit in which he insists Vann is his "bitch" is the funniest thing in the movie. And now I've spoiled it for you. Sorry.
For the most part, "The Man" squanders its wee potential by asking the stars to play as broadly as possible. This is a disservice to them both but especially to Levy, who repeatedly bugs his eyes cartoonishly as the camera bears down on him. He's a concatenation of wonk cliches and the most Caucasian thing in the movie, to the point where Levy's makeup appears to have been laid on extra-pallid. "The Man" can thus lay claim to being some sort of cultural benchmark: It's the first whiteface comedy.


         Given the state of digital effects, it seems entirely possible that the lame action-comedy "The Man," starring Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy, was assembled from bits cut from the actors' previous movies. That's not to imply they phoned in their performances; let's just say the roles are very familiar.
 
  Levy plays Andy Fiddler, a nebbish of a dental supply salesman who travels from Wisconsin to Detroit for a convention. Jackson parodies Denzel Washington in "Training Day," as well as his own persona, playing Derrick Vann, a renegade ATF agent.
 


         






    In a less than clever setup, Fiddler is mistaken for Vann by gunrunners — yes, as a matter of fact, they are incredibly stupid gunrunners — and then the "fun" ensues. Vann forces Fiddler to continue the charade, while Fiddler doles out familial advice to the divorced Vann. They squabble, they fight crime, they (almost) hug. It's basically a pathetic remake of the much funnier 1988 Martin Brest film, "Midnight Run," in which milquetoast mob accountant Charles Grodin is dragged along for the action-adventures of skip tracer Robert De Niro.
 
  Although "The Man" is barely 80 minutes long, it plods under the direction of Les Mayfield, whose previous efforts — remakes of "Miracle on 34th Street" and "Flubber," plus "Encino Man," "Blue Streak" and "American Outlaws" — don't engender high expectations. The movie screeches to a halt numerous times simply to let Jackson and Levy go at it over the former's need to see his daughter's dance recital and the latter's inability to digest red meat without becoming grossly flatulent.
 
  Screenwriters Jim Piddock, Margaret Oberman and Steve Carpenter break up the love fest with the occasional car chase or to allow Vann to pummel a suspect, but otherwise the script is entirely invested in the curriculum vitae of the two leads. The characters would barely exist on paper without Levy and Jackson to fill them out (albeit with 100% recycled material). In some ways, "The Man" plays like a sequel to some terrible movie that was mercifully destroyed before it was ever released.

The buddy action comedy is now the megaplex equivalent of an old vaudeville routine. It is shticky, it is beyond predictable, it is such a creaky ritual that one would be hard-pressed to remember when it was actually fun. Yet someone  audiences? writers? studio bean counters?  refuses to give it up. In The Man , the forces of circumstance that place Samuel L. Jackson, as a street-dapper Dirty Harry of an undercover ATF agent, and Eugene Levy, as a dental-equipment salesman so mild he looks like he carries a slide rule, in the same law-enforcement car are contrived enough that the film barely asks you to believe them. Levy, with his skewed gaze and neurotically logical manner of Schmuckus Americanus, mistaken for an icy arms dealer? Why not! Jackson, who puts the funk in being in a funk, forced to use Levy as bait? But of course!
Most of The Man  is as awful as last year's Jimmy Fallon–Queen Latifah debacle, Taxi , yet Levy, stuck in a no-brainer variation on Billy Crystal's predicament in Analyze This , shows just enough noodgy passive-aggression to suggest what the movie might have been were it not shackled to buddy-action clichés. The money scene, to the extent that The Man  has one, arrives when Levy, to sustain his cover, has to slap Jackson in front of the bad guys and ask, ''Who's my bitch?'' It isn't quite Gene Wilder learning to walk like a soul brother in Silver Streak , but it'll do.

 In "The Man," a new action-buddy comedy directed by Les Mayfield, Eugene Levy plays Andy Fiddler, a nerdy dental-supply salesman who travels to Detroit for a convention. Before he leaves, Andy's wife warns him to be careful. "Detroit isn't Wisconsin," she says.  No, it isn't, and in any case, she's speaking in a rather obvious code. But it should be noted that this Detroit, apart from a few aerial skyline shots, is actually Toronto. However you describe it, the city is a hotbed of crime, especially the traffic in stolen firearms, in which Andy becomes unwittingly embroiled. This is because he is mistaken for Derrick Vann, a truculent federal agent played by Samuel L. Jackson, who is trying to crack a gun-running ring and also   dodge an internal-affairs investigation.  The idea that anyone would mistake Mr. Levy, the very embodiment of Caucasian dweebiness, for Mr. Jackson, the last angry black man of the American cinema, is just about the funniest thing in "The Man." And while nothing in the movie - least of all the two main performances - is especially fresh or original, it does have a few decent gags and amusing moments. Mostly, of course, Mr. Levy looks anxious and put upon, while Mr. Jackson curses and hits people - in particular, a petty hustler named Booty (Anthony Mackie), who gets a trash-can lid in the face, a phone book to the back of the head and a Coupe de Ville in the body part for which he is named.  It's a nice car, by the way, and unlike the movie, it may have really been made in Detroit. A lot of the film takes place in its front seat, where Andy rides shotgun, while Derrick drives and fulminates. Andy also suffers from a bout of flatulence, a bit of comic business so priceless that the filmmakers repeat it later in an elevator.  Otherwise, the two men explore the meaning of manhood, and argue about who might be said, and under what circumstances, to be the other one's bitch.  Andy learns to assert himself, and Derrick learns a bit of sensitivity as they chase down the bad guys (led by the eager, snarling Luke Goss) and evade the snoops from internal affairs (led by the reliably reptilian Miguel Ferrer). Also on hand are the "Saturday Night Live" big guy Horatio Sanz as an evidence-depot flunky and the "Curb Your Enthusiasm" termagant Susie Essman as Derrick's commanding officer. The whole thing is over in less than 90 minutes.  "The Man" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has profanity and violence.

The Man" trades solely on the audience's good feelings for the contrasting comic profiles of Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy. With Jackson as a ruthless, no-BS ATF agent and Levy as an unsuspecting dental supply salesman caught up in a criminal plot, casting -- and the inevitable shtick it brings -- is the most important element of this functional if thoroughly uninspired movie. Because it clings to the comedy-action template of "48 Hrs.," pic feels like it could have been made 15 years ago. This not-quite-fall release will arrest a good number of eyeballs in its opening weekend, before a rapid transfer to vid precincts.
Thrilled that he's set to deliver a speech at a dental supply convention in Detroit, Andy Fiddler (Levy) ventures from his Wisconsin home to the Motor City. Agent Derrick Vann (Jackson) is in a far more sour state, as his partner has been executed in the wake of a theft of arms from the Dept. of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms' Detroit headquarters.
Internal affairs agent Peters (Miguel Ferrer) presumes Derrick is as dirty as his partner, who was in on the heist. A tough, glowering cop with funky street cred, Derrick scorns Peters while using his vintage, souped-up Cadillac as a weapon to force street punk Booty (Anthony Mackie) to spill info on the crooks.
Andy and Derrick finally come together through an unlikely mix-up involving an edition of USA Today and a lunch bag containing a gun that's delivered by a tanned, clean-shaven Brit named Joey (Luke Goss). Thinking he's nabbed a key player in the stolen-arms deal, Derrick holds Andy under arrest, quickly realizing this well-mannered but motor-mouthed fellow is both more and less than he bargained for.
With Jackson and Levy side by side in a car for long stretches of time, director Les Mayfield ("Blue Streak," "Encino Man") needs only to cut back and forth between thesps' faces as they spar, retort, opine, scream and insult each other. Given the absurd gap between the black cop who flirts with danger and cusses a blue streak and the white Jewish Midwesterner who's more of an out-of-towner than Jack Lemmon, "The Man" is most surprising in that it rarely plays the race card. Instead, pic relies purely on Levy's and Jackson's performing instruments; as Mayfield shoots things, it amounts to a battle of arching eyebrows.
Everything else here is at the periphery, including an exceedingly pallid plot symbolized by Goss playing yet another of Hollywood's slickster European baddies, surely the most tired and overdone of stock characters. Joey is actually the heist's mastermind, whom Derrick dupes into thinking Andy is a big-time arms trader.
Not an iota of it makes sense--including a thin side plot involving Derrick's ex-wife and young daughter -- but the Jackson-Levy show is all that counts, even when screenwriters Jim Piddock, Margaret Oberman and Steve Carpenter can come up with nothing more for the pair than extended fart jokes.
If acting is reacting, then Jackson and Levy do an awful lot of acting. And if Jackson used to be the one who could be relied on to steal scenes, then Levy has taken that job over with deadpan assuredness.
Despite a noticeable use of Toronto street locales for Detroit, Adam Kane's lensing, Carol Spier's production design and general staging opt for a fairly convincing look and feel. The 79-minute playing time is indicative of the film's slim content.

"It's a tasty burger," federal agent Derrick Vann (Samuel L. Jackson ) tells visiting dental supply salesman Andy Fiddler  (Eugene Levy ), shortly before driving to a diner and ordering his hesitant friend some ground round, not realizing that red meat gives Andy gas. Loud gas. Why The Man which has Jackson, coffee shop repartee, and endless passenger-driver banterwould choose a line to further remind viewers of Pulp Fiction  is a question for greater intellects than those who will see it. It's as if one of the Police Academy  sequels had alluded to Chinatown . In this dreary rehash of the buddy-cop paradigm, Levy plays a walking punchline, his character having accidentally wandered into an undercover gun-running bust and been mistaken for Vann, who was posing as a buyer. So Vann needs Andy to close the deal. The two drive around Detroit trading barbs, wisdom, and duties as each other's "bitch." Notably, Vann shoots Andy in the ass and teaches him to use taco sauce as an antiseptic. In turn, Andy directs Vann to soften his language, instructing him to follow every use of "fuck" with "cryin' out loud." ("Pretty soon," he says, "you'll be saying, 'For crying out loud!' ") Fuu . . . cryin' out loud, this movie's dumb.
