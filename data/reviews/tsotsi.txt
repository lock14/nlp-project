         When the mugging he masterminds ends in murder, and a member of his gang chooses this delicate moment to make some ill-advised inquiries into his past, Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae) beats his buddy senseless and runs out into the rainy night, demons nipping at his heels. He stops to catch his breath in front of a beautiful house, just as its owner is pulling up in a BMW. Tsotsi seizes the moment, and the car, shooting the woman when she tries to climb back in on the passenger side. It's not until he is nearly back to the township that Tsotsi hears the baby gurgling in the back seat.
 
  The official South African entry for the Academy Awards and a nominee in the best foreign-language film category, "Tsotsi" was adapted by Gavin Hood, who also directed, from the novel by playwright Athol Fugard. Tsotsi — his name literally means thug in the patois of the Soweto townships — is the steely-eyed leader of a small band of heavies. There's the now out-of-commission Boston (Mothusi Magano), who once dreamed of being a teacher; Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe) a murderous creep; and Aap (Kenneth Nkosi), a slow-witted bully with murky allegiances. Hood transposed the story from 1950s Johannesburg, where it was originally set, to the present, both for financial reasons and for greater ease of relating, though it's not exactly good news that the story adapts so seamlessly to post-apartheid South Africa. But then, that's less a comment on that country's political history than on global poverty in general, and the depressing universality of its effects. Fugard's novel ends with Tsotsi being literally crushed by the fascist state. Hood's film ends on a more hopeful note, although in the absence of a specific villain, the circumstances make you queasier. Who's to blame for Tsotsi's terrible life?
 


         






    Hood avoids overt references to South Africa's political past, actually, and it's hard to know what to make of it. All of Tsotsi's victims are black, though they range from rich to middle class to poor. (The only whites in the film are a pair of more or less benign cops.) But he draws straight and steady lines from Tsotsi's criminal present to his suffering past. An AIDS orphan whose father abused him, Tsotsi eventually graduated from sleeping in the orphan hive of the stacked drainpipes outside the township to a corrugated steel shack of his own by sheer force of will and repression of memory.
 
  The flashbacks are meant to bridge the gap between roving menace and besotted dad, but they mostly just compromise the movie's naturalism and suggest a lack of confidence in the plausibility of the premise. They also make an overenthusiastic argument for nurture in the old debate, dressing up Tsotsi's childhood traumas as latent paternal instincts, waiting for the right moment to spring: crouching nurturer, hidden father.
 
  Whatever its weaknesses, "Tsotsi" is redeemed by its excellent performances. Chweneyagae has the amazing capacity to look like a hardened criminal one moment, a child the next. After a series of mishaps involving newspaper diapers and condensed milk, Tsotsi follows a shantytown Madonna named Miriam (Terry Pheto) home one afternoon and holds her up at gunpoint, demanding she feed his baby. Tsotsi sits and watches, his hard edges visibly softening — the implication apparently being that the key to crime reduction is to put more nursing mothers and cute babies on the street. Still, it's a pleasure to watch the interplay of emotions on Chweneyagae's face as he contemplates Miriam and imagines — you imagine — forming a little family (at gunpoint) of his own.
 
  What makes "Tsotsi" ultimately as heartbreaking as it is, is Chweneyagae's subtle characterization. He imbues the character with a dreaminess that encourages you to dream with him, drawing you in to the overlooked tragedy of his life. By refusing to trump it all up with unnecessary bombast, distractingly famous faces, lung-collapsing histrionics and excessive post-nasal drip (as witnessed in last week's carjacked baby movie), Hood lets the story unfold at a steady, unhurried pace, cutting only when necessary, and allowing the actors, and the audience, to absorb the impact of each moment. The result is that the final scene creeps up on you quietly, with equally quiet and devastating effect. Having just this week watched some of the most idiotic screen violence I've ever seen, I can confidently attest to the devastating emotional power of nonviolence. Chweneyagae's expression at the end of the film is more jolting and painful than any bang and spurt, and Hood has the stomach not to turn away.

 R for violence   

Oh, to be a silent intern, able to sit in on the deliberations of the mysterious few who select each year's Oscar nominees for Best Foreign Language Film! How enlightening it would be to learn firsthand how more than 50 submissions from around the world are whittled down to five!
I'm dreaming, of course: The gaudy process of politicking by which American Oscar contenders muscle into front-runner positions seems positively transparent compared with the opacity of taste at work in the Oscarization of world cinema. All a movie lover can know is that a certain number of inscrutable judges have decided that a certain quintet of films from other countries is Academy Award-worthy. And that the populace must take the judgment on faith, since most of the nominees have not even been released in the U.S.
So the world turns, at least at the Kodak Theatre, where I couldn't possibly guess what will win on March 5. (What should win is easier  more on that later.) Will it be Tsotsi ? Gavin Hood's crowd-pleasing, synthetic adaptation of a novel by the esteemed playwright Athol Fugard combines many elements that might appeal to idealists, including sad poverty and violence tempered by personal redemption, a story set in an exotically rough 'hood, a gurgling kidnapped baby who is the catalyst for that redemption, and a snappy visual style, in City of God  mode, suitable for airing on MTV. Presley Chweneyagae makes an attractive Tsotsi (the word means ''thug'' or ''gangster,'' because the young man has lost even his name in Johannesburg's mean shanty streets), and when he brings the stolen baby to a local young mother (Terry Pheto) for nursing, the beautiful actress is lit like a Madonna. More calculated than a Starbucks sampler CD, the picture could win the up-from-hardship award.

 The life and hard times of the criminal underclass has been a staple of the movies nearly as long as pictures have flickered across screens. Not only because violence is inherently captivating (nothing commands our attention faster than a brandished gun), but also because stories about the down and out almost invariably carry a patina of sociological import. In 1915, the great Hollywood auteur Raoul Walsh took to the Bowery to shoot "Regeneration," the story of an orphan who grows up to be a gang boss, only to be saved by a good woman. Now the South African director Gavin Hood has told more or less the same story in his film "Tsotsi."  Mr. Hood, who both wrote and directed "Tsotsi," shot his story of regeneration in a Johannesburg shantytown crammed with life and corrugated-metal shacks. Based on the novel of the same title by Athol Fugard, written in 1961 though not published until 1980, the film pivots on a vicious 19-year-old thug named Tsotsi who leads a small gang of thieves. The word tsotsi — which means hoodlum and may derive from zoot suit — refers to rootless South African young male criminals who, having no tribal connections, take many of their cues from American gangster movies. Certainly, the character Tsotsi, played by the charismatic newcomer Presley Chweneyagae, seems to have consumed his share of big-screen shoot-'em-ups. He's as compact as Al Pacino's Tony Montana and just as lethal.  Shot in Super 35 millimeter, a format that allows Mr. Hood to exploit the emotional and psychological uses of color photography, the film opens with a game of craps. Very quickly we learn that life here is little more than a game of chance in which losers greatly outnumber winners. Tsotsi would likely count himself among the latter. Along with his lackeys — the broken-down Boston (Mothusi Magano), the pitiless killer Butcher (Zenzo Ngqobe) and the foolish Aap (Kenneth Nkosi)  — he preys on the unsuspecting with a heart of stone and a sharp metal spike. In one brutal scene, Butcher slips that spike into a middle-aged man who, having impertinently flashed a wad of cash, is left on the floor of a subway car like a scrap of garbage.  The crime that leads Tsotsi down a different path, giving him a shot at redemption and the story its hook, occurs one evening in a comfortable suburb. After savagely beating Boston to a pulpy mess one drunken night, Tsotsi takes to the streets where he soon steals a running car. The owner, a woman who had just stepped into the rain to ring a doorbell, clings to the car even as Tsotsi steps on the gas, and her desperation soon becomes understandable: there's an infant boy (played by two ,  cherubs with twinkling eyes and mighty lungs) gurgling in the backseat. Although Tsotsi ditches the car, our heartless thug stashes the baby in a shopping bag and carries him back to his shack as if he were a gift, which, of course, the child is.  You don't have to read crystal balls to see into Tsotsi's future; you just need to have watched a couple of Hollywood chestnuts in which hope trumps despair, and individual good will triumphs over all. That may help explain why  the movie  was nominated for an Academy Award for foreign-language film: despite the flavorful patois and subtitles, "Tsotsi" isn't much different from every studio cautionary tale with an unhappy past, a criminal present and an unhappier future. Although no James Cagney, Mr. Chweneyagae delivers a fine, sympathetic performance, and you root for the actor even when his character inspires unforgiving thoughts. To his credit, Mr. Hood's meditation on truth and reconciliation doesn't traffic in the cheap thrills of art-house exploitation, like "City of God"; he wrings tears with sincerity, not cynicism.  "Tsotsi" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film features scenes of extreme violence, and the sight of a real baby crying so much may upset some viewers.
A widescreen wallow in socially enforced slum nihilism brought to you by Miramax , Tsotsi  could be pegged as City of God  relocated to the Soweto  shanties, but it eschews the ironic swagger and strobe-speed action of Fernando Meirelles 's lurid jigsaw for a more conventional arc: the tough guy humanized by a cute kid. Known by a nickname meaning thug  in the local vernacular, Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae ) is the de facto leader of a small gang whose casually ritualized viciousness is displayed early on when they stab a man in a crowded subway car. Tsotsi's apparently hazy background piques the interest of his colleagues (none of whom look far out of their teens); when drunken Boston (Mothusi Magano) asks one question too many, Tsotsi beats him nearly to death, then flees from the scene through movie rain and right into a carjacking opportunity so ripe for the plucking it must have been scripted. Only after Tsotsi has shot the driver and roared away in her BMW  does the baby in the backseat make himself known . . .
Thereafter, not since Kevin Smith 's Jersey Girl  have audiences been offered such a spectacle of watch-through-your-fingers ineptitude regarding the care and feeding of an infant. The wee bairn is swaddled in poopy newspapers and covered in condensed milk and ants (don't ask) before Tsotsi thinks to hold a nursing neighbor, Miriam (Terry Pheto ), at gunpoint so she'll feed his acquisition. The film enlists this young womanwho was quite possibly widowed in a Tsotsi-led campaignfor a Madonna-and-child aura of earthy beatitude; confronted with Miriam's mother-earth halations and the baby's sheer irresistible babyness, Tsotsi is soon in thrall to the stirrings of a stunted conscience and insurgent memories of his own doomed mother, bad dad, and a runaway childhood spent sleeping in a drainage pipe.
Nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the upcoming Oscars (its native tongue is the Tsotsi-Taal patois), Tsotsi  is whittled down from a novel by Athol Fugard  set in the 1950s; that the story can be so easily transposed to the post-apartheid present day is one of the movie's saddest inferences. Writer-director Gavin Hood  isn't inoculated against cliché; the flashbacks are mawkish, and when Tsotsi sneaks up on a disabled beggar in an abandoned lot, the soundtrack signals the threat with a Sounds "R" Us rattlesnake effect. But Lance Gewer's sunset-burnished photography is a nice changeup from the grainy, handheld stampeding usually associated with on-screen street grit, and Chweneyagae, with his smooth, androgynous features, earns his many close-ups. From certain angles, the actor can look ageless and sexless, and the physical ambiguity perfectly suits the role: First appearing as a terrifying tabula rasa, Tsotsi takes on jagged facets of flailing immaturity and stillborn innocence.
