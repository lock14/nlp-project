Any movie that opens with a quotation from Maya Angelou, follows that with a clip from an old racist cartoon, cuts to someone posting a racial slur on a dorm room door, then immediately serves up Sarah Jessica Parker as dean of students wants to get on your nerves. By that measure, "Spinning Into Butter" counts as some kind of success.
Adapted by Rebecca Gilman and Doug Atchison from her 1999 play, the film is set on the campus of Vermont's fictitious Belmont College, the sort of liberal-arts paradise where every day is the first day of fall and nothing bad ever happens. So imagine the shock when one black student  - his name, metaphor lovers, is Simon Brick, for his soul is so heavy  - finds himself the object of hate crimes.
Dean Parker, so prone to sticking her Manolo Blahnik in her mouth, wants to call the police. One Belmont professor and the college dean  - played by blustering Beau Bridges and a comically tense Miranda Richardson, respectively  - want to hold campus-wide discussion forums. But at these events, the non-white students are miffed that they don't get to talk. The broadcast media arrives in the form of the attractive Mykelti Williamson, who makes suggestive eye contact with Dean Parker faster than you can say "Jungle Fever." He tries to get her to open up about her past, which involves work at an all-black school where Something Happened  - although, trust me, it's not what you think.
Meanwhile, the undergrads are restless  - the ones who aren't rotten with complacency. "We don't want to be ghettoized," says a black student. "That's where you belong," says a white one. Everyone keeps calling this place Belmont College, but the flagrant urge to offend suggests Geraldo Rivera University.  Professor Bridges defensively pours the words "you people" on a mixed crowd and ignites a race riot. The white students have lantern jaws. The black ones haven't brushed their hair (they keep it so real). The TV reporter, after exhibiting so much self-confidence with Dean Parker, develops an inferiority complex: "Maybe you don't like black guys," he tells her. Or maybe she doesn't like caricatures of them. Who can say?
The esteemed stage director Mark Brokaw makes his movie debut here, but if I were he, I'd just keep bragging about all my theatrical success. The haphazard camera work (why so many crane shots and canted angles?), one-dimensional acting, and student-film staging create the wrong environment to manage such an inflammatory subject. It's taken Parker her whole career to commit such acting cliches as popping awake after a nightmare into a sliver of fake moonlight. She can now check that off her to-do list.
It's unclear what "Spinning Into Butter" wants to tell us about racism on college campuses, except that it exists. The movie verges on melodrama, farce, and satire, but never makes any dramatic sense. Nor does it demonstrate any psychological or racial curiosity. It's also woefully out-of-date, awaiting theatrical release for years, and based on an incident from the early 1980s. Despite all the hyperventilating, the movie fails to consider what these crimes mean when, say, the residents of the White House happen to be black. The filmmakers recognize that identity politics are often a trap door. But it's one they're helpless to save themselves from falling through.

Shelf mold (on a reportedly troubled production completed in 2005) encrusts this   misshapen adaptation of Spinning Into Butter , and Rebecca Gilman's 1999 play about racism and toxic political correctness at a small Vermont college  is lumpy enough as it is. A painfully miscast Parker nervously flips her hair and waves her hands, sitcom-style, as a do-gooding dean of students who must face her own prejudices on a campus where all her white colleagues apparently are hypocrites and fools. Williamson plays a local black journalist  all too obviously a minority position in Vermont.

 When Sarah Daniels (Sarah Jessica Parker), the dean of students at Belmont, a small liberal arts college in Vermont, calls in Patrick Chibas (Victor Rasuk), one of her brightest students, to tell him the good news that he qualifies for a $12,000 scholarship, she is unprepared for his response. Asked to fill out a form in which he designates his ethnicity, he refuses to call himself Hispanic. He insists that he is Nuyorican, someone born in New York of Puerto Rican descent. Sarah cajoles him into writing “Hispanic” for practical reasons, but that’s not the end of it.  This argument about terminology is the opening skirmish of “Spinning Into Butter,” the screen adaptation of a play by Rebecca Gilman that was well received when it opened nine years ago in New York after originating at the Goodman Theater in Chicago.  The movie is a methodical, not to say mechanical  and plodding, exploration of identity politics and language as a treacherous  minefield of hostility and evasion. The further you tiptoe into this territory, the more difficult it is to retreat.  The movie takes its title from “The Story of Little Black Sambo,” Helen Bannerman’s 1899 children’s book about a boy  in India who, to avoid being eaten by tigers, gives them his flashy new clothes; the jealous tigers chase one another  around a tree until they are spun into melted butter. The book was popular until the word Sambo became identified as racially derogatory. Like those tigers, the characters in the movie  run around  in circles until they become a rhetorical  blur.  The screen adaptation, directed by Mark Brokaw from a script by Ms. Gilman and Doug Atchison, is a smart, squirm-inducing exploration of the hidden, potentially explosive subtexts in dialogues about race and ethnicity. The story focuses on Simon Brick (Paul James), an African-American and model student who begins receiving racist threats, including an anonymous note warning him to go back to Africa.  As the harassment escalates, a rock is thrown through his window, and the college turns itself inside out to  uncover the culprit. The local news  media, led by an African-American anchor, Aaron Carmichael (Mykelti Williamson), become involved. And a forum, intended to air grievances and calm everyone down, opens  a Pandora’s box of resentments.  Many scenes are devoted to the deepening friendship, with a romantic undertow,  between  Sarah and Aaron, two people who like and respect  each other  but are continually having to explain what they mean. Before moving to Vermont, Sarah taught at a mostly black college in Chicago, where her rowdier students forced her to confront her own racism.  Reviewing the play in 2000, Margo Jefferson of  The New York Times  described “Spinning Into Butter” as a “post-comic, post-tragic farce,” although it isn’t at all funny. It is farcical only in the sense that its characters, especially the all-white faculty and the college president, Winston Garvey (James Rebhorn), are mouthpieces of ludicrous boilerplate reeking of condescension and incomprehension. Even the term minority is scrutinized and found poisonous.  “Spinning Into Butter” is less a movie than an essay.   Ms. Parker’s earnest, workmanlike performance typifies skillful acting that gives the characters as much dimension as the language allows. If that language generates plenty of heat, the characters’ inner selves rarely peek out from under the heavy political baggage weighing them down.  “Spinning Into Butter” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong language.

A college dean faces a race-relations fracas in �Spinning Into Butter,� a decent film translation of Rebecca Gilman�s widely staged play. Troubled production commenced filming in October 2005, hit a publicly acknowledged �financial glitch� and is still dodging rumors of non-payment to some workers; despite the behind-the-scenes drama, smoothly handled on-screen result retains the play�s principal strengths as an involving, accessible if schematic vehicle for provoking discussion about myriad hot-button racial topics. Nonetheless, in style and content, Sarah Jessica Parker starrer is the kind of earnest, talky, modestly scaled social-issue pic that seems predestined for the smallscreen.
Sarah Daniels (Parker) is starting her second year as dean of students at Belmont College in beautiful northern Vermont, when an ugly incident suggests campus life might not be so idyllic after all. Sheets covered with racist epithets and a stick drawing of a lynched body have been found pinned to the dorm door of black student Simon Brick (Paul James).
Police are called, reporters start sniffing around and the overwhelmingly white administration panics. They call for a mandatory-attendance forum that consists mostly of Caucasian staff delivering p.c. homilies about unity and tolerance. At a second forum, youth frustration first turns on the mortified staff, then develops into a full-on brawl revealing just how little unity is felt between different student cliques.
Naturally, this is delightful fodder for heat-seeking TV and print media. As the controversy rages and angry rhetoric escalates, worsening threats continue to be made against mild-mannered Simon. In a public-relations panic, the university president (James Rebhorn) and fellow deans (Miranda Richardson and Beau Bridges) simply dump the problem of somehow cleaning up this mess into Sarah�s lap.
But Sarah, who previously worked at an inner-city college and is thus considered by default a liaison to �persons of color,� has her own issues to contend with. Her one ally is Aaron Carmichael (Mykelti Williamson), not a welcome presence initially, since he�s the first reporter to show up. But their mutual rapport and tentative romantic vibe provide some relief -- even as the pair�s own disparate racial backgrounds inevitably turn the campus crisis into something personal. 
Onstage, Gilman�s snappy dialogue and brisk narratives let her issue-driven works transcend polemicism. In the more literal-minded film medium, though, these virtues can come off as too much telling, not enough showing. 
First-time feature helmer Mark Brokaw and scribe Doug Atchison (who adapted with Gilman) open up the play effectively enough, but there are inevitable moments when dialogue and situations don�t quite lift off the page. Revelation of the racist vandal�s identity, more shocking in the play because the perp is never seen onstage, here comes off as predictable, as well as another talking point checked off the endless list of U.S. race-relation matters.
Deglammed via darkened hair and plainer makeup, Parker makes an appealing protagonist, sparking nicely in her scenes with the affable Williamson. Supporting perfs are well-judged, though Richardson and Bridges have limned similar bitchy/hypocritical characters all too many times before.
Tech and design contribs are conventional but pro.

At an elite Vermont  college, a self-identifying Nuyorican student (Victor Rasuk ) fumes over having to identify himself as Hispanic to receive his minority scholarship, a compromise advised by Dean of Students and general purveyor of liberal guilt Sarah Daniels  (Sarah Jessica Parker ). Meanwhile, when an undergrad receives racist threats ("The Story of Little Black Sambo," giving the film its title), the hate crime brings excessive attention to the school via local TV reporter Aaron Carmichael  (Mykelti Williamson ). Director Mark Brokaw 's flat, over-dollied adaptation of Rebecca Gilman 's sanctimonious play (co-scripted by Gilman and Doug Atchison ) approaches its ideas of reverse racism and the hypocrisies of tolerance with a heavy hand and odious moralizing. "You want me to solve racism with a bulleted list?" Sarah asks a member of her out-of-touch administration, then admits in a heated moment that she left her post at a predominantly African-American university because black people were loud and scary. Every line of dialogue sounds contrived, right up to the phony-baloney twist ending and Aaron's sincere rejoinder to Sarah: "Most people are racist. They just don't know that they're racist."
