Correction Appended Children see more than they understand, and understand more than they know. Their intense, limited way of perceiving the world, sometimes sentimentally rendered as moral innocence, is one of the reasons they are frequently placed at the center of movies about war, revolution and other forms of social upheaval and political disaster. Gonzalo (Mat�as Quer), the 11-year-old boy at the center of Andr�s Wood's "Machuca," is warily edging toward adolescence, preoccupied with the petty brutality of the schoolyard and the unspoken miseries of his upper-middle class Santiago household. But because his coming of age takes place in Chile in 1973, his ordinary hardships, joys and rites of passage are charged with inordinate tension. The audience, aware from the start that the military coup against Salvador Allende's government lurks on the horizon, feels their sympathy for this child - and their more general nostalgia for childhood - shadowed by anxiety and dread. For the most part Mr. Wood, who based the film on events from his own early life, confines the story to Gonzalo's perspective. Intimations of Chile's volatile political situation pop up almost casually, via the television set, graffiti in the street and overheard adult conversations. But there is no queston that Gonzalo's private world, like his country, is in a state of ferment. A soft-faced, passive boy, he is forced to accompany his mother (Aline K�ppenheim) on visits to her lover, an older, wealthy sensualist who buys the boy's complicity with handsome bound editions of Lone Ranger comics. At home, Gonzalo has to deal with his weak-willed father and his sister's loutish boyfriend. At the private English-language boys' school Gonzalo attends, the headmaster (Ernesto Malbran), a priest flush with the experimental, egalitarian spirit of the Allende government, has granted scholarships to a few boys from the nearby slums. One of them, Pedro Machuca (Ariel Mateluna), becomes Gonzalo's friend, and introduces him to another side of life in Santiago. Pedro also introduces Gonzalo to Silvana (Manuela Martelli), a tough, fearless shantytown girl who becomes their frequent companion, and the crux of a sweet romantic triangle that makes parts of "Machuca" resemble a juvenile "Jules and Jim." The three friends help Silvana's father take advantage of the political situation by selling flags at competing demonstrations, and play kissing games on the banks of a muddy creek. "Machuca," which opens today at Film Forum and which is Chile's submission to this year's Academy Awards, is both sweet and stringent, attuned to the wonders of childhood as well as its cruelty and terror. Mr. Wood allows the story to unfold at a leisurely, almost dawdling pace, which matches the consciousness of his young protagonist. There are moments that feel forced and schematic - in particular those that insist on revealing Gonzalo's school as a microcosm of a society riven by class and ideology. The greater achievement of the film lies in showing both the weakness and the tenacity of those divisions. The friendship between Gonzalo and Pedro shows how arbitrary they are, and how affection and decency can overcome such differences. But historical circumstances rule out false comfort or redemptive optimism. Mr. Wood ends Gonzalo's youthful idyll with a few short, painful strokes -scenes of the military takeover that capture the harsh, emphatic force with which authoritarian rule announces its arrival. The television proclaims that the army has restored order, and a newspaper headline proclaims the return of normalcy. But the scenes of soldiers taking over Gonzalo's school and subduing Pedro's neighborhood show the reality behind the euphemisms. While Mr. Wood's political sympathies are clearly with the victims of the coup, he never suggests that the events of September 1973 were simple, or that they can be easily understood. But "Machuca" nonetheless has a tough, heavy clarity. Its point is not to settle scores or reopen old wounds, but rather to explore, after a long period of repression, the possibility of grief. The youthful condition it evokes most strongly is not innocence but impotence - the discovery that you are powerless to protect the people you care about from harm, and also powerless to protect yourself against the shame of your own failure.
A new Chilean film that touches down in urban/suburban Santiago  mere days before the September 11, 1973, coup d'état that murdered Salvador Allende  and placed Pinochet into bloodletting power, Machuca  is nevertheless an oddly tame affair. Director-co-writer Andrés Wood says he consciously relied on his own childhood memories, but the film whammies, forecasts, and simplifies as if it'd been born in a Sundance screenwriting lab. Standing numbly at center stage is Wood's stand-in, Gonzalo (Matías Quer ), a blond, picked-on bourgeois schoolboy far less aware of his country's street protest upheavals than of his mother's blithely indiscreet infidelities. Soon enough he links up with Pedro (Ariel Mateluna ), a shantytown kid of native extraction, and the two wade through the historical moment's political tensions. Selling it to the cheap seats, Wood keeps the dynamics Ron Howard -iconic: The upper-middle-class families are vain and arrogant gargoyles, the poor are lively and soulful über-peasants. As if we're in danger of missing something, Gonzalo has an appetite for The Lone Ranger  comics. ("White men and Indians are never friends!" someone yelps. "Sure they are!" is the reply, summing up the film's philosophy.) Every scene leads up to a class-war exclamation point. Given this particular social storm, attaining a realist texture would've been a substantial achievement; Wood settles for clichés and spotlighting. Only in a bitter mid-Mass community debate, and in an outrageous street march scene (Gonzalo's pink-skirt-suited Playgirl  sits in a Buick's window, clanks a frying pan, and screams anti-Communist cant), does the pre-junta fervor reach an inspired pitch.
At the three-quarters mark, the "insurrection of the bourgeoisie" finally hitsglimpsed by Gonzalo as smoke in the distanceand Wood ably finds a handful of chilling passages and at least one image that's worth holding on to: a post-execution tableau of wrecked family, smoking ruins, and poised soldiers. But Machuca  is still a half-measure. Wood is fastidious about period set design, but not much else; rather than burning with experience, the film feels opportunistic. In a country decisively torn as so many have been between the haves and have-nots, Wood's autobiographical template isn't very engaging; Gonzalo is little more than a mute spectator throughout, and Quer is a chubby mope. Even amid the military crackdown, Wood's plot mechanics are formulaic; someone'll take a bullet, and you knew in the first half-hour who it would be. In the end, Machuca  (the film named after Pedro and his Syd Field-doomed family) feels dismayingly solipsisticWood seems to think that of all the tragedies and dramas that the Pinochet putsch produced, none are as profound as his own, riding home from the war zone on his bike, plagued by a guilty memory.
