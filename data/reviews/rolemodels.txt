Misanthropy in the movies has a new face. And, surprising to say, it�s a handsome one. A matinee-idol face, in fact. Some might even go so far as to call it �dreamy.� It�s the face of Paul Rudd, a talented comic actor who�s spent the better part of his 15-year career floating just below the superstar radar, backing up less talented comic actors in movies such as Knocked Up
, The 40 Year Old Virgin
, and Anchorman
, seemingly without complaint or bitterness. Now, at last, Rudd has his shot at the marquee (I�m going to ignore this year�s abysmal Over Her Dead Body
 if it�s all the same to you), and he makes the most of it, mainly by defying all reasonable Hollywood expectations of what a marquee role is supposed to be. His character in Role Models
, Danny Donahue, is cranky, cynical, mean to children, endlessly put-upon, bad with women, and in the midst of an epic existential crisis. He�s like W.C. Fields with chiseled cheekbones and bedroom eyes. Too smart for his own good by half and stuck in a job peddling an energy drink called Minotaur to elementary school children, Danny knows he�s a failure, and he takes out his frustrations on unsuspecting Starbucks baristas, unmoved tow-truck drivers, his long-suffering girlfriend (the ubiquitous Banks), and his blissfully self-indulgent, sexually omnivorous partner in caffeine shillery, Wheeler (Scott, once again playing Scott in a role that could only be played by Scott). When Danny snaps one day under the influence of too much bitterness mixed with too much Minotaur, he and Wheeler are forced by court order to take part in a child-mentoring program called Sturdy Wings (run with hawklike vigilance by the indispensable Lynch), where they learn the value of caring about others while struggling to provide guidance to a teenage nerd who lives for his foam-sword medieval-fantasy battles (Superbad
�s Mintz-Plasse) and an 8-year-old with the mouth of a David Mamet character (�Fuck you, Miss Daisy� is the boy�s response when Danny tells him and Wheeler to be back with the car at a certain time). Beautifully cantankerous for 45 minutes or so, it�s all downhill for Role Models
 once its two self-involved antiheroes actually start turning into role models, and the transition from feel-bad to feel-good comedy is all the more painful for its squelching of Rudd�s cosmically dyspeptic disaffection. Unlike other recent Judd Apatow and post-Apatow comedies that push the boundaries of what�s funny by pushing the boundaries of good taste, Role Models
 � for a while, at least � pushes the boundaries of what�s funny by daring to argue that good taste doesn�t mean a thing when you�re staring into the abyss, and the abyss is staring back at you, and you realize that you�re too depressed to care.


'Role Models" might just be this year's "Bad Santa." Not because it's foul-mouthed and foul-minded in ways calculated to appall all right-thinking moviegoers, although it's certainly that. Any movie that shows its heroes firing up a joint between stints as high-school anti-drug crusaders is true to its black little heart.
No, David Wain's scruffy, anti-everything comedy about two grown-up losers mentoring two young losers in a Big Brothers program is remarkable for the way it mines the comedy of defeated expectations. One of the leads, Paul Rudd's Danny Donahue, has been selling nuclear-colored caffeine beverages to school kids for a decade and has just about lost the will to live: His McJob has metastasized into a McLife. His partner, a grinning goofball named Wheeler (Seann William Scott), actually likes dressing up in a Minotaur costume and bellowing "Taste the Beast!" Together they're the Mutt and Jeff of recession America.
After Danny is dumped by his lawyer girlfriend (Elizabeth Banks), he drives his Minotaur-mobile up a statue, which results in an arrest and court-mandated community service for himself and Wheeler. They're assigned to "Sturdy Wings," a mentoring program overseen by a grizzled yet impossibly peppy 12-step survivor named Gayle Sweeney (Jane Lynch from "Best in Show" and "Talladega Nights"). Describing herself in an introductory video, Gayle explains, "My father was a traveling salesman; my mother, out of necessity, was a whore."
Wheeler's mentee is Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), an 11-year-old with the vocabulary and hormones of a sailor looking forward to shore leave after two years at sea. Danny gets Augie Farks, a sullen nerd whose life revolves around LAIRE, a fantasy role-playing game whose members meet in the park and hit each other with Styrofoam swords while speaking in potted medievalese. Augie's played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse from "Superbad" - the character's basically that movie's McLovin with fewer social graces.
The film lets these four shambolically collide with each other, learning twisted life lessons while the supporting characters avert their eyes in distress. It's not funny in a conventional punch line-and-response way, but you find yourself laughing anyway: The attitude of prostrate comic disgust is contagious.
"Role Models" works because Wain and Rudd (who collaborated on the script) have the same bed-head sense of humor. They don't work for a gag so much as sidle up to it, kick the tires, then snort in disbelief. (Scott is just along for the ride, grinning that Cheshire Cat grin that implies he's either smarter than anyone here or much, much stupider.) That the movie's oddly endearing climax combines fantasy role-play and a deep, abiding love of the music of KISS is just icing on a spiked cake.
Wain's filmography has been rocky (he made the sly teen-comedy parody "Wet Hot American Summer" as well as the horribly unfunny "The Ten"), but he knows enough to trust his stars. Rudd in particular is becoming something unusual in American movies: A leading man who appears to truly not give a damn.
He's handsome and obviously smart; he could have had Ben Affleck's career if he'd tried a little harder, or maybe Tobey Maguire's. But there's something proudly lazy in Rudd; those bleak green eyes hold contempt for the whole business of stardom. "Role Models" plays well within the Judd Apatow playpen, but its shaggy-dog dyspepsia renders it both less commercial and a little more dangerous, and Rudd is why. He's W.C. Fields trapped in the body of Cary Grant.


Role Models  is a comedy about two loser-slacker- underachievers (they hawk energy drinks at public schools  'nuff said) who get arrested for crashing a truck and then sentenced to 150 hours of community service. Each of them has to play big brother to a kid with major adjustment problems, and if you hear that and think, ''Isn't this a remake of some maximally dumb comedy from the 1980s?'' you’d be justified. The fun of Role Models  is that it's a high-concept movie executed with speed and finesse and the kind of brusquely tossed-off obscene banter that can get you laughing before you know what hit you. The fish-out-of-water setup may be claptrap, but the movie feels loose, shaggy, and improv-y. Especially after Danny (Paul Rudd), a 35-year-old mope who sounds as if his soul has been burnt to a crisp, and Wheeler (Seann William Scott), a skirt chaser without a single mean bone in his body, arrive at the Sturdy Wings mentorship center and discover that trying to actually, you know, relate  to a kid is their own special brand of hell.
Wheeler is assigned to a pint-size pottymouth (Bobb'e J. Thompson) as mentally agile as he is misbehaved, while Danny gets stuck with Augie, a myopic nasal teenage dork who devotes his afternoons to organized medieval role-play. Christopher Mintz-Plasse plays this super-dweeb with such conviction that you're not sure if you want to laugh at him, give him a pep talk, or slap him silly. The director, David Wain, had devious fun putting bad youth movies through the wringer in Wet Hot American Summer , and here he shows a corkscrew affection for the kind of studio comedy that's far too by-the-numbers to be mistaken for reality. What makes Role Models  a kick is that its heroes act as if they can't quite believe their predicament is real either. Rudd delivers put-downs like a toxic avenger, while Scott, in his freshest star turn since American Pie , uses his disarming sweetness to make Wheeler the most nuttily likable of sleazebags. They're matched by Jane Lynch, who plays the Sturdy Wings overseer as an ex-addict who couldn't be prouder of those addictions; she's hooked on overdoses of ego. The big medieval battle of the cardboard swords, with our heroes done up like the Knights of a certain rock band, is an event the movie pays tribute to by seeing through every gloriously geeky minute of it.

Judd Apatow neither wrote nor directed “Role Models,” the newest entry in the increasingly worn-out “boys will be babies until they are forced to grow up” school of arrested-development comedies. But he might as well have. Directed by David Wain (“Wet Hot American Summer”), it follows the silly misadventures of two flailing Peter Pans who are forced to do community service to avoid jail time. These superannuated brats, Wheeler (Seann William Scott) and Danny (Paul Rudd), are temperamental opposites. Wheeler is the same drooling skirt chaser, with the same idiotic grin, that Mr. Scott played in the “American Pie” movies. Danny is a whining, misanthropic underachiever who realizes he is in an occupational rut but is too depressed to do anything about it. Wheeler and Danny are best friends (who knows why?) and traveling salesmen who peddle a nauseating-looking energy drink called Minotaur. It is marketed to Southern California high school students, with the slogan “taste the beast,” as a healthy substitute for a drug high. Wheeler appears in costume at school assemblies as the hairy corporate mascot, Minotaur Man, while Danny half-heartedly delivers the product’s official good-health spiel to blank-faced students. Wheeler loves his work, but Danny, who suspects the drink may be poisonous, loathes it. He vents his discontent to his girlfriend, Beth (Elizabeth Banks), a successful lawyer, who becomes so fed up with his bellyaching that she dumps him. After an especially dismal presentation in which Danny veers off script and disparages Minotaur, he goes ballistic in a traffic dispute that destroys the company truck; both he and Wheeler receive 30-day jail sentences. Beth negotiates a compromise: they can avoid jail with 150 hours of community service. The alternative to prison is a mentor program for troubled youth called Sturdy Wings, founded by Gayle Sweeny (Jane Lynch), a gung-ho do-gooder and former cocaine addict who is so full of herself she comes across as a fire-breathing zealot. (Imagine a demented Suze Orman with heavy personal baggage.) Gayle, who won’t shut up about her addiction and recovery, inspires a zany performance from Ms. Lynch that transcends her turn as Mr. Rudd’s ever-lustful boss in “The 40-Year-Old Virgin.” With the ferocity of a drill instructor and the boundless confidence of a self-help guru who combines psychobabble clichés with embarrassingly explicit confessions, Ms. Lynch’s Gayle redeems the movie from utter banality. In the movie’s running joke the big brothers are more immature and brattier than the little ones they are charged to instruct. Until the roles are reversed, the film’s mommy surrogates, including Beth and Gayle, will have nothing to do with them. Wheeler’s “little brother,” Ronnie (Bobb’e J. Thompson), has an even dirtier mind than his mentor and suggests a foul-mouthed Gary Coleman. Danny’s little brother, Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), is a teenage über-geek, cut from the same cloth as Fogell, a k a McLovin’, Mr. Mintz-Plasse’s character in “Superbad.” He lives in the fantasy kingdom of Laire, an elaborate dungeons-and-dragons-like live-action role-playing game whose players dress up as knights, damsels and wizards in the Middle Ages — a world a teenage misfit can get lost in. Although “Role Models” pokes fun at the game, Laire is taken seriously enough to be the vehicle for both Augie’s and Danny’s redemption once Danny enters the game. The movie would have been much funnier, not to mention genuinely subversive, had it laid waste to both the pretensions of Sturdy Wings and the fantasies of Laire. But for the crowd-pleasing finale, in which the players don Kiss makeup for a final battle, “Role Models” pours sugar and cream on everything and turns it to mush. “Role Models” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and profanity.

After two comedies ("Wet Hot American Summer," "The Ten") loaded with cult appeal that failed to dent the box office, David Wain aims for the mainstream with "Role Models." Laden with more than enough profane humor to warrant its R rating, this is nonetheless a formulaic crowd-pleaser whose outwardly crass, soft-centered conceit would work as well for Adam Sandler or Eddie Murphy. All to the good, however, that it's tailored to the equally impeccable comic chops of Seann William Scott and Paul Rudd. Steady laughs and upbeat word of mouth should make this a solid if unspectacular fall performer.
Los Angelenos Danny (Rudd) and Wheeler (Scott) work for energy-drink company Minotaur, driving a novelty monster truck to schools where they -- Wheeler costumed as hairy "Minotaur Man" -- plug their legal-high product via facetious "Just say no to drugs!" pieties. It's a no-brainer job that suits Wheeler fine, leaving him free to obsess 24/7 over his only real interest, which is getting laid.
Danny, however, thinks he's wasting his life. Feeling a need for change, he impulsively proposes to longtime girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks), but she's so fed up with his sourpuss attitude that she dumps him outright. An already horrible day ends in a tow-truck altercation that leaves the two boy-men facing 30 days in jail on various charges.
Beth, a lawyer, manages to cut them a deal for 150 community service hours instead. They're handed over to Sturdy Wings, a big-brother-type mentoring program run by Gayle Sweeney, played by Jane Lynch as a one-woman Molotov cocktail, equal parts perky, stern and lunatic.
Wheeler gets assigned Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson), a fatherless 10-year-old with a vile temper and filthier mouth. Sarcastic Danny gets Augie (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, "Superbad"), a consummate teenage dork with no friends outside the realm of his ultra-dweeby live-action medieval fantasy role-playing game.
Needless to say, these forced pairings do not start well, though with equal predictability, bonding does eventually occur -- if not always in the most age-appropriate ways. There's also no great surprise to the adult blunders that nearly wreck these intergenerational relationships, or to the big, climactic setpiece in which the guilty parties make sacrifices that prove they care after all.
But if the material has a formulaic feel and the dialogue often skews more rude than clever, "Role Models" nonetheless amuses throughout. That's in large part due to the stars, whose roles very much play to their familiar comic strengths: Scott's manic, borderline-demented party animalism and Rudd's ability to knock a line out of the ballpark with a deadpan bunt. Supporting turns, kids included, are also nicely done down the line. Lynch commits grand theft of scene after scene; Banks, seen to fine advantage in concurrent "W." and "Zack and Miri Make a Porno," gets little to do as the sole character not allowed to be funny.
Pacing is brisk and tech aspects are pro, though, in line with most recent comedies from the extended-Apatow-family camp, pic seems allergic to the notion of even attempting visual stylishness.

Paul Rudd  wears the constant look of glazed-eye amusement; everything seems to tickle him, even that which annoys or frustrates or disappoints him. He's frat-boy handsome, and therefore almost anonymous when he stands in a movie-star lineup; in Neil LaBute 's The Shape of Things  (2003), Rudd received a supposedly extreme makeover and came out the other end looking unaltered. But Rudd is an effortless comedian—deadpan, quick but not glib, never eager to please—whose signature moves (a grimace, a grin, a tilt of the head and a muttered one-liner that always sounds improvised) have been honed to perfection during his collaborations with Judd Apatow , who cast Rudd in The 40-Year-Old Virgin  and Knocked Up , and who audiences will likely think wrote, produced, and/or directed Rudd's latest, Role Models , as well.
But, no, Role Models  is the brainchild of writers David Wain  and Ken Marino , both of the almost-deserving-of-its-cult-status comedy troupe The State, and Rudd himself (who shares screenplay credit). Wain (who also directed and cameos) and Marino (who co-stars) were the first to recognize and utilize Rudd's mannerisms when they cast That Guy From Clueless  in 2001's Wet Hot American Summer , a rather odd decision to parody Meatballs . Then, last year, Wain and Marino called on Rudd's services again for the episodic, hit-and-miss The Ten  (in which he played an adulterous narrator) and Diggers , Marino's soft-focus autobiography recast as a 1970s-set dramedy, in which Rudd proved himself capable of going deep when need be.
Their partnership has evolved nicely, even profoundly, if that's the right word for a movie in which a little kid says of Gene Simmons , Paul Stanley , Ace Frehley , and Peter Criss , "I didn't know Jews could sing like that." With Role Models , the twitching ironic wink of WHAS  that gave way to Diggers ' heart-sleeve sincerity has settled into a firm middle ground, where Smart-Ass Laughs play off Sincere Moments of Affection. And the climactic showdown, straight out of the recent documentary about the live-action role-playing game Darkon, gives Role Models  just the proper—nay, sir, heroic!—amount of dork.
In every way, this is just another formulaic romp about two selfish slackers getting their priorities rearranged by a couple of kids—instead of breaking new ground, it polishes it with sandpaper. As reps for an energy-drink company, Rudd and Seann William Scott  are going nowhere—except to the schools where they pitch their product's buzz as an acceptable substitute for illegal drugs. Wheeler (Scott) loves the gig, despite the Minotaur costume in which he does his five shows daily for smart-ass kids who wonder if he got the cow outfit at the gay zoo. Wheeler is the sad, stunted Stifler, if he grew up to become a soft-drink company's peddling Plushie.
Then company suit and spokesman Danny (Rudd) chooses the occasion of his breakup with longtime girlfriend Beth (Elizabeth Banks , in what amounts to little more than an extended cameo) to sabotage their slacker gigs by running their monster truck up a school's statuary. For that crime of stupidity (among others), Wheeler and Danny are offered a choice: go to jail for a month or mentor two boys in a Big Brothers–type organization called Sturdy Wings, run by a rather unsteady former coke whore played by Jane Lynch . The Sturdy Wings logo makes for a rather subtle sight gag: When splayed across a woman's T-shirt, the wings resemble hands wrapped around breasts. Indeed, there is no shortage of booby humor here: booby jokes, booby-spotting advice, and even boobies themselves. (Admit it: "Booby" is one hilarious word.)
Wheeler gets paired with 12-year-old Ronnie (Bobb'e J. Thompson ), a self-proclaimed "booby man" who says "fuck" every time he exhales. The son of a single mother, Ronnie's less a brat than a brawler trying to fend off guys who choose fathering over jail time—some role models. And just when Ronnie's mini–Eddie Murphy  routine starts to grow stale, he's reinvented yet again as a Kiss  fan! Danny, meanwhile, finds himself stuck with McLovin', which is to say Augie, played by Superbad 's Christopher Mintz-Plasse , who last year starred in a phony public-service announcement in which he was warned of his pending doom as a typecast nebbish. Augie, though, is the geek who has no delusions of being cool; all he wants is to disappear into his medieval role-playing game, where it's perfectly acceptable to wear a cape and bow before a burger-joint king (played by Knocked Up  gynecologist Ken Jeong).
Of course, the inevitable transpires: Men who've behaved like boys begin acting their age, and boys who've been left to fend for themselves stop acting out. It's been the plot of every other Adam Sandler  movie—potty humor gets a hug. (Coincidentally or not, the poster for Role Models , in which Rudd's pissing on a brick wall, is almost identical to the one for Sandler's Big Daddy .) But Wain, Marino, and Rudd pull it off because theirs is a funnier, brainier, bawdier brand of feel-good . . . and because you can never go wrong with a climactic, foam-padded sword fight set to Kiss.
