There's irony in here somewhere but it's embedded so deep in the bones of this thing that it's hard to ferret out. Or maybe not. It seems to me that a comedy that purports to have a message about treating the intellectually challenged as regular human beings and stars Johnny "Jackass
" Knoxville is about as disingenuous as a comedy that urges us to see past a person�s body size to appreciate the beauty within and stars Gwyneth Paltrow in a fat suit. Oh wait. That�s Shallow Hal
, you say, and the Farrelly brothers already produced that movie a few years ago (with brother Bobby also directing)? And now they�re back producing The Ringer
, which happened to be filmed in the Austin/San Marcos area? I�ll leave you on your own to gnaw on the conundrums, but in case you don�t want to decide this ethical dilemma on your own, the Special Olympics powers-that-be have gone out of their way to offer The Ringer
 its official seal of approval. Therefore, this film must be good for you � or at least inoffensive to the spokespeople for the group most likely to take offense at the movie�s Special Olympics plot device. However, you have to wonder whether such a blessing has the capacity to turn a comedy�s humor from barbed to toothless. As it is, The Ringer
�s humor is never consistently anything. It takes a gauche premise � an average Joe enters the Special Olympics as a ringer, confident he will win big money that will pay off his uncle�s gambling debts and obtain the operation needed by his gardener (whose accident is his fault) � and adds on some comeuppance, romantic intrigue, and inspirational lessons. The result is an uneven comedy, whose occasionally hilarious lines of dialogue don�t fully compensate for its long interludes of predictability. To its credit, the filmmakers use lots of Special Olympians and intellectually challenged actors, and keeps them front and center throughout the film. Then there�s Knoxville, whose whole pre-movie-star identity was based on proving he would do the dumbest things imaginable. In The Ringer
 he plays dumb like a fox as he masquerades as Jeffy to rig the track competition and win the heart of Special Olympics volunteer Lynn (Heigl, currently seen on TV�s Grey�s Anatomy
). His fellow Olympians soon smoke out his ruse but follow that old adage about the enemy of your enemy being your friend, and so help train Jeffy to beat the arrogant returning champion Jimmy (Flowers). Knoxville is actually turning into a reasonable actor with a strong stage presence, Heigl works her preternatural division between angel and landlubber that she uses to such good affect on Grey�s Anatomy
 as the surgeon/former Playmate, and Cox is just baffling as the loutish uncle who looks at all times as if he�s doing a Joe Pesci impersonation. Screenwriter Ricky Blitt (TV�s The Family Guy
) has some inspired moments, although one wonders about the wisdom of the charges of idea theft he has launched at the head South Park
 hooligans, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who last season featured a show with a similar premise. Whether Ringer
, with its mild comedy and milder messages about inclusiveness and tolerance, will be embraced by Knoxville�s hardcore Jackass
 fans remains to be seen. But we can at least trust that the Farrellys will stay the course.


Do you care that Special Olympics and the National Down Syndrome Society endorse ''The Ringer"? Does it matter whether there's offensive material in this latest lowbrow comedy produced by the same irreverent Farrelly brothers who gave the world ''Stuck on You," ''Shallow Hal," and ''Dumb and Dumber"? Or do you really just want to know if it's funny?
Come on. You want to know if it's funny. And the answer is: kind of.
Directed by Barry W. Blaustein (''Beyond the Mat"), an ex-''Saturday Night Live" writer best known for his screenplay contributions to Eddie Murphy projects, ''The Ringer" stars Johnny Knoxville as an unchallenged pencil pusher who attempts to infiltrate a Special Olympics competition for personal gain. We'll get to the ridiculous premise for this despicable action in a minute, but the plot is less important than how fearlessly and humorously it plays out, and if you're expecting ''Jackass," you're aiming too high.
Blaustein, working from a script by sitcom-schooled Ricky Blitt (''Family Guy"), prefers to deliver a gentle film that serves up standard, mildly funny jokes and steers clear of anything truly outrageous. He gives the stereotypes a brief bit of floor time before proving them all wrong and routinely has Knoxville surrender the punch line to actors playing his inspirational competitors. But if the laughs don't often come at anyone's expense, they also don't come often enough. Way too much of ''The Ringer" is derivative filler that just sort of jogs along to the medals competition, which (getting back to the narrative setup) can't come soon enough.
When we meet him, Steve (Knoxville) is a meek cubicle rat and professional nice guy. Forced to fire a klutzy janitor, he offers the laborer a job doing his yard work, then shoulders the burden for costly surgery when the new hired hand gets chomped by a lawnmower. Meanwhile, Steve's Uncle Gary (Brian Cox) has a gambling problem that leads him to hatch a plan: If Steve, a track star and actor in his high school days, can play a ''highly functioning, developmentally disabled" athlete well enough to beat the pompous reigning Special Olympics champion, they'll cash in on a bet big enough to cover all debts.
So, hiking up his gym shorts and calling himself ''Jeffy Dahmor," Steve enters the competition, which he quickly learns is no joke. His fellow athletes (including several real-life Special Olympians) have his number from the start, and it isn't long before they're in on the charade, helping him train because they want to see the defending champ fall. Their efforts are sweet, but the only thing less believable than Steve/Jeffy sailing through this televised contest without being outed is his drippy relationship with a perky volunteer played by Katherine Heigl from TV's ''Grey's Anatomy."
''The Ringer" is big on inspirational messages -- try your best, dare to dream, keep on going even when water balloons are being thrown at your crotch -- and it's also committed to depicting the mentally challenged as individuals with a real range of personalities. But in striving to be fair beyond reproach, this movie misses many chances to be funnier. Good comedy doesn't make that choice, and great comedy doesn't have to.

         Think of "The Ringer" as a Farrelly brothers movie, neutered. It still might pee on the carpet or chew up the furniture, but it won't get the neighbor's dog pregnant. Written by Ricky Blitt and directed by Barry W. Blaustein, but produced by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (along with Bradley Thomas and John Jacobs), the film stars Johnny Knoxville as a former high school athlete with unfulfilled thespian aspirations who feigns mental deficiency to fix the Special Olympics.
 
  Brian Cox costars as Uncle Gary, whose idea it is to have his nephew Steve (Knoxville) enter the competition in order to defeat the heavy favorite, Jimmy (Leonard Flowers). Uncle Gary hopes to literally bet his house to relieve him and Steve of their respective debt. Nothing goes as planned as the genuinely special athletes quickly wise up to Steve but have a rather surprising scheme of their own. The filmmakers worked closely with Special Olympics representatives and, though the movie bears some of the Farrellys' trademark outrageous humor, it has a sweet demeanor and makes a noble statement. Many of the roles are filled more than capably by "diff-abled" actors, and it's a tribute to the film that in some cases it's difficult to tell them from other actors playing disabled characters. They also have some of the funniest lines. Katherine Heigl of "Grey's Anatomy" plays Knoxville's love interest.

 "The Ringer,"
 PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, language and some drug references. Running time: 1 hour, 34 minutes. In general release.
   

It sounds like the ultimate poor-taste bonanza: a comedy set at the Special Olympics, with a cast made up, in large part, of the mentally challenged plus Johnny Knoxville as a con man who tries to fix the Olympics by pretending to be one of them. The surprise of The Ringer , co-produced by the Farrelly brothers, is that the movie, which is pretty damn funny, invites us to giggle at the awkwardness of its characters  the toneless speech and dippy jokes, the junior-high earnestness about sex  yet it refuses to see them as stumblebum saints. Instead, they're testy, aggressive regular guys who are so used to being condescended to that they've evolved a mode of literal-minded one-upmanship all their own. Knoxville mugs with ace imbecility as Olympics fraud ''Jeffy Dahmor,'' zigzagging between spasms of guilt at the lowness of what he's doing and the ability to do it with peculiar shameless verve; he's especially good at slapping himself to convey fear. Cruel and inhuman? Not in The Ringer , a film that does for the mentally challenged what Revenge of the Nerds  did for the pocket-protector set, finding a hidden coolness in their ability to be themselves.


The bark of "The Ringer" is far more outrageous than its bite. Built on the ostensibly jaw-dropping premise that a non-disabled guy with money problems (played by Johnny Knoxville) conspires to fix the Special Olympics, the latest entry from the Farrelly brothers' stable indicates the pair's trend of downplaying their instincts for daring comedy in favor of a softer brand of humor. Sometimes veering close to being a promotional film for the Special Olympics, pic will be applauded by the disability community and its advocates but quickly ignored by longtime fans of the Farrellys and Knoxville for a subdued B.O. run.
To be sure, the Farrellys (serving as producers) aren't behind the camera nor the script; that would be, respectively, Barry W. Blaustein (of the terrific pro wrestling doc "Beyond the Mat") and Ricky Blitt (of TV's "Family Guy"). But pic is very much branded by the Farrellys' template of juggling extreme physical comedy with life lessons, and having able and disabled actors mingle on screen, with able thesps often playing characters with wildly severe physical challenges.
The spin this time is that Knoxville's Steve, able but an office flunky, ends up posing as an intellectually challenged fellow who signs up for the Special Olympics. Setup is strained beyond belief, as Steve is "promoted" to a post that compels him to fire company janitor Stavi (Luis Avalos), then guiltily hiring him as his house gardener. The now uninsured Stavi accidentally cuts off some of his fingers in the garden, and Steve must fork over $28,000 to get his fingers surgically reattached.
Looking to his shady Uncle Gary (Brian Cox) for help, Steve realizes he not only has no money to loan but is himself deep in debt to cutthroat loan sharks. A TV spot for the Special Olympics gives Uncle Gary the kooky idea for Steve to register as an athlete in the games being held in Texas, while the uncle sets up betting odds against dominant favorite Jimmy (Leonard Flowers).
Of course, this assumes that Steve can easily beat Jimmy, which is immediately unlikely, given Jimmy's aura of invincibility and Carl Lewis-like physique, to say nothing of his stretch limo and imposing posse. The script's rather sweaty and overworked mechanics for getting Steve into the games would also be much easier to bear if Knoxville were up for posing as a convincing Special Olympics competitor, while letting viewers in on the con. But the role is beyond Knoxville's limitations, so he can't create the illusion of a guy who's trying to create an illusion.
This also damages the impact of Steve's savvy roommate Billy (Edward Barbanell) and fellow athletes quickly spotting that he's a faker -- not difficult, really, given Knoxville's weak portrayal. The one who's slowest on the uptake is sweet Lynn (Katherine Heigl), who takes a liking to Steve -- or, rather, Steve's Olympics alter ego, "Jeffy Dahmor" -- and he to her, setting up his inevitable unmasking with its dire emotional consequences.
A pleasant effect of the guys around Steve knowing his con is that they join in on his conspiracy to dethrone Jimmy, whose star egomania makes him their arch nemesis. It also allows for that rare sight in the movies of extended comedy and action scenes involving several disabled thesps outnumbering the able ones, until any initial differences melt away -- precisely the result the Farrellys, Blaustein and Blitt are after.
Besides the funny sight of Cox eagerly playing a scumbag in a sports setting imbued with the best intentions, the most memorable thesping turns by far are from such challenged actors as Barbanell, finding amusing notes to play as Steve�s newfound friends.
It says something about pic's benign profile and avowed mission to alter auds' view of the disabled that the most classically Farrelly-esque moment happens far from the Olympics track in a Catholic confessional box with Steve and a royally pissed-off priest. Production package is squeaky clean, with soundtrack buffed up by repeated use of Elmer Bernstein's theme from "The Magnificent Seven."

Perpetually toeing the line that divides hilariously poor taste from forced humanitarian concern, the brothers Farrelly are now caught in a purgatory somewhere between John Waters  and Frank Capra . Perhaps as penance for There's Something About Mary 's intellectually disabled lightning rod Warren ("Franks and beans!") and Me, Myself & Irene 's crude portrayal of multiple-personality disorder ("From gentle to mental!"), the bros have produced the self-lacerating Special Olympics sanctioned curio The Ringer . Punching the clock as the poor man's Adam Sandler , Johnny Knoxville  plays a nine-to-fiver who decides to rig the Special Olympics as a scheme to make quick cash. Knoxville becomes Jeffy Dahmor  (haw-haw), a nebulously disabled track star who attempts to best a showy, bling-blingin' gold medal pentathlete. The movie turns progressive, I guess, in portraying some Special Olympians as villains and assholes, but why do they rally behind Dahmor after stripping off his facade? The Ringer  is at least more humane than Crispin Glover 's unreleasable, unwatchable What Is It? , but it's also an uncomfortable intermingling of message movie and gross-out comedy, a sporadically funny vehicle that indicts its audience for laughing. Come on, guys. You can't have your fun and eat it too.
