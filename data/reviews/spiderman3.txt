Ever since 2004�s Spider-Man 2
 became one of the rare sequels that bested its predecessor in terms of narrative originality and visual audacity, expectations have run high for this third entry in the series. Having defied the odds once, perhaps it was unrealistic to hope for a three-peat. Sadly, Spider-Man 3
 in no way (except budget) surpasses the movie that came before it; like Icarus of myth, Spider-Man 3
 may have attempted to soar too close to the sun and melted some of its infrastructure in the process. The movie still thrills and captivates but is overstuffed with story fragments and earthbound dramas that have been inserted but then treated like second-tier guests at the film�s real party: its gravity-defying heroics. The numerous chases and rescues that bob and weave through the skyscrapered air space of Manhattan have been stunningly rendered by director Raimi and cinematographer Bill Pope. However, screenwriter Raimi (who co-authored with his brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent) is not on such sure footing when it comes to the pedestrian dramas of Spider-Man�s human counterpart Peter Parker. Maguire as Parker/Spider-Man has an atypical modernist moment in his opening voiceover. He stands outside a movie theatre that�s showing a Spider-Man
 film and assures us that things in his life are peachy: He�s famous (despite remaining incognito), still at the top of his class, and in love with the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane (Dunst). In short order, his love life becomes complicated when Mary Jane is fired from the Broadway show she�s supposed to open in (this hitch in her career doesn�t forestall the movie from slowing down a couple times to hear her warble a tune), and Parker is too wrapped up in Spidey�s adventures to notice. For comfort, she turns to their old pal Harry (Franco), who also has a second identity as the New Goblin � an adversary of Spider-Man's until amnesia makes him conveniently forget the feud. Amnesia?! But there are many more adversaries for Spider-Man to battle. There�s Sandman (Church), whose molecular processes are a wonder of movie magic; the lingering injustice of who killed Uncle Ben; the new upstart photographer at the newspaper (Grace), who also comes into contact with the goop from outer space, which, of all the moving vehicles in the world, attaches itself to Parker�s motorbike and turns humans it comes into contact with to the dark side. Instead of his red-torsoed spider suit, Parker soon wears a black-chested one, and the space goop turns the human Parker into a jerk in a dramatically primitive sequence that has him strutting down the avenue Saturday Night Fever
 style, snapping his fingers at the babes and combing his hair forward in a downbeat emo mode. This is the dark side? In short, there are way too many storylines here, especially for a movie that turns stiff whenever it�s on the ground. When cascading through the cityscape, Spider-Man 3
 still makes us gasp with delight, but on Earth, those gasps come solely in reaction to the cynical dreariness of the script.


We all know Tobey Maguire spends a lot of time in the ��Spider-Man�� movies on his best behavior. But for one comical stretch in ��Spider-Man 3�� (which, to the relief of zillions, opens everywhere tomorrow night at 11:59), Maguire wilds out. The explanation is a long one. But basically, an inky substance from outer space follows Peter Parker home, invades his Spider-Man uniform, and introduces him to the ample thrills of being bad � as bad as somebody who suddenly looks like he fell in with Fall Out Boy can be.
Peter wears this new black suit beneath his street clothes like an undershirt. Soon his jeans get a little tighter, his patience a little thinner, and his hair long enough to flip in hilariously cocky irritation. He struts down the streets of Manhattan in a dual state of geeky entitlement and Travoltan bliss while some lite disco-funk plays around him � he�s got night fever. The ladies who stop to check him out aren�t turned on. But he�s impressed himself. It�s as if, over night, Peter has gone from lowly bio-chemistry student to biotech jerk. Don�t worry. It�s a phase.
Under the playful yet perceptive direction of Sam Raimi, ��Spider-Man�� has always been about its characters� psychological and emotional tribulations. But this sequence feels fresh because it�s a real release. The rest of ��Spider-Man 3�� is an intricately plotted saga which takes our hero from adolescence to adulthood. After six years, the franchise may be familiar, and lucrative, yet it hasn�t curdled into a burdensome series of ones, zeroes, and dollar signs.
This time, the villains � including Thomas Haden Church as Sandman � aren�t villainous so much as misunderstood pains in the neck. Dark forces spring from the central characters� self-doubt, and life-size insecurities from human personality crises.
In the opening minutes, Peter and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), are ecstatically in love when we catch up with them. By the end the previous movie, he had come out to her as Spider-Man, and now her stage career has taken off.
After the opening night of her new musical, they lie in a deluxe web and stargaze in a park. The sight of Maguire and Dunst, who�s as radiant and vulnerable as ever, suspended like that, making out, is a wonderful image: simultaneously innocent, weird, and erotic. Then in the background a glowing meteor blazes softly to earth, and that black blob oozes out. Peter and Mary Jane are gleefully oblivious, driving off on his motorbike, as the goop affixes itself to the fender.
This could well be the opening scene from a 1950s B horror flick, and points to a gleeful hook of the ��Spider-Man�� series: The coolest thing about these movies is how uncool they are. Raimi gives us Eisenhower-era squareness that blooms in a technologically state-of-the-art New York. ��Spider-Man�� exists out of time, so the walk, say, from Natalie Wood to Kirsten Dunst is very short.
In any case, Peter and MJ, as he calls Mary Jane, don�t have equilibrium for long. She wants a little humility, but he loves that New York loves Spider-Man. Right before he can ask her to marry him, she walks out in frustration. On the bright side, she finally seems to have a found a flattering hair color.
Meanwhile, Peter and Harry (James Franco), who, when we meet him, is still seething at Peter/Spider-Man for killing his father, the Green Goblin, achieve an accidental rapprochement. A show-stopping fight between them in the first 20 minutes leaves Harry with a memory-erasing concussion that temporarily reboots their friendship. When Harry gets home from the hospital, he and Peter share some boyish horseplay around his penthouse. It�s a gentle, affectionate contrast to their near-murderous brawl a few days before.
Maguire and Franco still seem to be enjoying themselves after all these years. You really miss Franco�s easy-going nature when he�s gone for too long. But the editing is so smartly paced that the second you want to see him, there he is.
The script keeps Maguire on the move, but part of the reason this movie sails along with such deceptive effortlessness is that he keeps finding energetic new gears to play this character. Peter began as an affable nerd whose powers shocked him. Then he became a cauldron of emo disaffection, wanting love but too meek and selfish to declare himself. Now he�s on the cusp of adulthood, struggling to balance his emerging self-confidence, his intense affection for MJ, and the exhaustion of working two jobs that still keep him living in a dumpy apartment. (Crime may not pay, but from the looks of it neither does stopping it.) He keeps a police scanner beside his bed and has to face the possibility that Sandman may have killed his Uncle Ben. Throughout, Maguire makes it all look like the easiest acting he�s ever done.
Raimi, who shares script credit with his brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent, strikes an exquisite balance between pop and woe, drama and whooshing adventure. The series has the shadows and demons of Tim Burton�s two ��Batman�� films, but the sensibility is very comic book. Bill Nunn, Elizabeth Banks, and the rousing J.K. Simmons, as the implacable editor J. Jonah Jameson, resume their roles at the Daily Bugle where Peter works as a freelance photographer, giving the film a screwball zing.
This time Peter finds himself competing with an arrogant new hotshot, Eddie Brock (played by Topher Grace), whom Jameson will grant a staff job should he find incriminating photos of Spider-Man. With the new black suit � which, for Peter, becomes a freeing id � catching naughty Spidey could get easier.
This, by the way, is a movie of intense replacement and doubling. Grace is Maguire�s lankier, more sardonic doppelganger. Like Peter, Harry discovers another self. Even Mary Jane gets an opposite number in Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), a blond model whom Bad Peter starts seeing.
Describing ��Spider-Man 3�� as busy is an understatement. It sets out to accomplish a lot, maybe too much: The film lasts well over two hours, and toward the climactic fight sequence fatigue starts to set in.
To their credit, though, Raimi and his big, hard-working crew are determined to dazzle (the budget is rumored to be almost $300 million), even at the risk of bombarding us with pleasure, people, images, action, and real feeling. The movie has the curious effect of leaving you over-fulfilled. When it�s done, any appetite for another event picture, even one half as well made as this, is temporarily curbed.
Don�t get me wrong. Blockbusters with this much going on should come along more often. But they should also come with a doggie bag.


         'The opening credits for "Spider-Man 3" showcase moments from the 2002 original, pieces of time that remind us that once upon a time the story of a spider-bit boy turned love-struck crime-fighter was just another movie hoping to be a hit.
 
 What a difference a few years and more than $1.6 billion in worldwide Spidey and Spidey 2 theatrical receipts makes. All that money means that it wasn't in the cards for "Spider-Man 3" to be a tale that demanded to be told in any artistic sense, a story that anyone burned to make for anything like purely creative reasons.
 


         






   Rather, this is a film that commerce mandated, a marketing puzzle that insisted on a solution, an über-franchise whose north of $250-million budget and sky-high expectations make it a master that must be served, a monster to be fed, an imperious creature with its own needs and drives.
 
 In the face of those unbending commercial imperatives, it is simultaneously encouraging that this "Spider-Man" actually attempts to bring some originality to the table and disheartening that those attempts are not enough. Certainly acceptable as a sequel to a sequel, "Spider-Man 3" misses an opportunity to be a movie that could be wholeheartedly recommended to those not already ensnared in its web.
 
 Without doubt, anything that money can buy was provided for returning director Sam Raimi (who, with a brother as a credited co-screenwriter and children in cameos, is turning the franchise into a bit of a family sinecure). More than  a thousand people worked on the production, some of them putting in the 8,000 hours it took to construct the film's 40 Spider-Man suits and others writing ultra-complex CGI software that we are told "required 10 man-years to code." That's a heck of a lot of code.
 
 Unfortunately, all that money also allowed spendthrift "Spider-Man 3" to acquire too many villains. It is one of the weaknesses of the Sam Raimi & Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent script that our hero has to contend with so many menaces — Sandman, Venom, New Goblin, even some especially toxic gook from outer space — that none of them gets the traction the wonderful Doc Ock did in the last film.
 
 First among equals is the Sandman, both because of Thomas Haden  Church's performance and the special effects involved. Church, best known for his wacky work in "Sideways," spent a year bulking up for the role of a troubled troublemaker named Flint Marko who claims "I'm not a bad person, I've just had bad luck." The film's ability to turn Marko into a creature of sand — ground corncob was used after 16 varieties of the real thing failed to pass muster — is wizardly.
 
 One reason Church is effective is that he's excited by this, his first "Spider-Man" appearance. Conversely, the weakest performances come from the film's two stars, Tobey Maguire as the overly earnest webbed hero and Kirsten Dunst as frustrated girlfriend Mary Jane Watson.
 
 Though both performers endeavor to be heartfelt, the film's emotional component — the strength of the original "Spider-Man" — feels unmistakably pro forma by this point in time. Even supplying both protagonists with potential new romantic interests, including Bryce Dallas Howard as hotshot blond Gwen Stacy and Topher Grace as her beau, doesn't stop the nonaction parts of the film from feeling as if  they're running on fumes.
 
 To their credit, Raimi and company seem to be aware of this problem and, though they stumbled in the way it is presented, they have come up with a potentially effective new kind of opponent for Spider-Man. That opponent would be Spidey himself.
 
 We get a hint of this dynamic in the film's opening, as we hear Spider-Man's voice-over boasting that he's come a long way in how he stands in New York's esteem. In fact, he practically gloats, "they love me." Just the way it's said indicates that public acclaim is going to this man's swelled head, that he's getting stuck on himself to a potentially dangerous extent.
 
 As anyone who's heard anything about "Spider-Man 3" knows, Peter Parker's bright red spider suit eventually turns a dazzling black, as his character gives in to his dark side and, in the film's most amusing moments, gets downright nasty as he hits a jazz club in his wanderings around town.
 
 But rather than take the more adventurous route of having a superhero with a legitimate nervous breakdown — something the original Marvel comic would have relished — the movie opts to lay it all at the feet of that nasty substance from outer space. It's by far the safer choice commercially, which means it is the only choice in town.
 
 Though aspects of it are entertaining, the presence of all these mismatched pieces give "Spider-Man 3" an ungainly, cumbersome feeling, as if its plot elements were the product of competing contractors who never saw the need to cooperate on a coherent final product.
 
  "We always have a choice," Peter  says at one point, delivering one of this film's numerous uplifting messages. Here's hoping that the choice about whether to make yet another "Spider-Man" is based on more than the almighty bottom line.
 
 
 "Spider-Man 3." MPAA rating: PG-13 for sequences of intense action violence. Running time: 2 hours, 20 minutes. In general release. Opens Friday, with midnight shows in some theaters on Thursday.   

Call him a square, or maybe a guy who has run out of new tricks, but no one could rightly label the hero of Spider-Man 3  a slacker. For 2 hours and 19 minutes, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), in the guise of his web-spurting alter ego, does fierce battle with a dissolving molecular-mutant shape-shifter called Sandman, who might have risen from the digital desert of a Mummy  sequel. He also confronts Venom, a reptile-headed prancer of an alien, as well as Harry Osborn (James Franco), his old comrade/nemesis, who's all too eager to retrofit the Green Goblin mask and flying skateboard of his late father. On the home front, Peter must deal with a girlfriend, the lovely Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), who feels frozen out by him, not to mention the biggest baddie of all: the hidden demon that lurks inside. All in all, that's a heavy burden to pile on Tobey Maguire's star-child gawk and perpetually curled baby lips. It's also a lot to ask of moviegoers, who in this jumbly, sometimes fun, sometimes dispirited sprawl of a sequel end up getting more bang for their buck...and also less.
Spider-Man 3  has terrific moments, but after the danger and majesty and romantic brio of Spider-Man 2 , those adrenalized rooftop ballets feel, more  than ever, like sequences : hermetic action miracles cooked up in the effects lab, with a story patched around them. Sam Raimi, directing his third Spidey adventure (the script is by Raimi, his brother Ivan, and Alvin Sargent), tosses together the rivalries, criminals, and amorous mishaps like salad, and he contrives a way to make Spider-Man into a figure of ''alienated'' vengeance without ever risking the tiniest sliver of audience market share.
In Spider-Man 3 , an asteroid crashes, just as in the old '50s sci-fi movies, and out of the fiery rock emerges a sticky, shiny black tangle  beware! It's the crawling audiotape!  that, for no discernible reason, heads straight for Peter, infesting his cruddy apartment like fleas waiting for a dog. The alien stickum is searching for a host, and when it finds one, it brings out the host's latent dark side.
His suit now black as a tire, Spidey, possessed, leaps over rooftops, pursuing a foe to what looks like a grisly demise. This time, he has a private stake in the square-off: Sandman, before emerging, Hulk-like, from a grand atomic snafu, was a desperate criminal named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who may have been responsible for the murder of Peter's uncle. The movie tells us, after the fact, that Spidey was doing his best to kill Sandman, yet the vengeful act in question looks closer to an accident, so the distinction between the ''good'' and ''bad'' Spider-Man is never more than cosmetic. It boils down to how abstractly demonic he looks in that shineless black suit.
Peter, by contrast, wears the dark side on his sleeve, if not his designer lapels. He's exorcising a more profound demon: the curse of nerdishness, which makes Maguire play every scene with the same dorky strangled whine and am I just nice or trying to get you to join a cult?  good-guy stare. There's got to be an escape from that Tobey daze, and as the crawling audiotape from space takes over, Peter lets loose, and Maguire lets his hair down  or, at least, lets a shock of it fall onto his forehead. It does him good. As he saunters down the sidewalk in a black suit, doing snappy Rat Pack things with his fingers, Maguire seems to be enjoying himself, even if it isn't clear whether the girls are giggling at him because Peter is suddenly sexy or because he seems to have lost his mind.  When he wanders into a jazz bar, where M.J., now estranged from him, is singing a set, he looks tough, talks tough, and finally takes over the floor of the club. At last, we see the secret that lies in Spider-Man's heart: It's Peter Parker's desire to dance as if he were in a revival of Cabaret .
Okay, I kid, but it's only because Raimi sets up the whole dark-side-of-a-hero business and then treats it like a Jim Carrey joke. Meanwhile, the movie lurches along on quasi-contrivances. You never see why M.J., after being fired from her play, neglects to tell Peter, or why, on a day honoring Spider-Man, he's willing to jab at her jealousy by restaging their famous upside-down kiss with the blond tart Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Topher Grace, as Peter's rival photographer, a smarm in frosted Brad Pitt hair, brings the movie a welcome dose of seething energy. And let's not take the effects scenes for granted. A few of them are indelible, like a vertiginous sky-high office disaster that evokes 9/11, or Sandman's tornado-to-giant-fist morphings, or the climax, with its scary plunging taxicabs. Spider-Man 3  is product, but it's a machine that tickles your eyes.

 If ever a movie had a case of the blues and the blahs, it’s “Spider-Man 3,” the third and what feels like the end of Sam Raimi’s big-screen comic-book adaptations. (Ready or not, the studio is talking about a fourth.) Aesthetically and conceptually wrung out, fizzled rather than fizzy, this latest installment in the spider-bites-boy adventure story shoots high, swings low and every so often hits the sweet  spot, but mostly just plods and plods along, as if its heart were pumping tired radioactive blood.  Maybe it’s middle age. In fictional terms Spider-Man a k a Peter Parker a k a Tobey Maguire looks like he’s pushing 23, but there’s something about the guy that shrieks midlife crisis. Peter is still hitting the books and   still snapping photographs for The Daily Bugle, run by the flattop blowhard J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons, in clover, as usual). It’s a living, kind of, enough for an enviably situated dump in Manhattan with artfully peeling walls and a fabulous picture window through which Peter regularly bounds into the air in full superhero drag. (The neighbors in this part of town evidently always keep the blinds drawn.) It’s a calling, sort of, though it’s also started to feel a bit like punching the clock.  The programmatic screenplay credited to Mr. Raimi, his brother Ivan Raimi (a third Raimi brother, Ted, plays a tiny role in the picture) and Alvin Sargent certainly feels more like work than play. The big selling point in “Spider-Man 3” is that Spider-Man or Peter or some combination of the two discovers his so-called dark side when an inky extraterrestrial glob (a symbiote in Marvel-speak)  spreads its gooey tentacles over his body, turning his suit and soul black. Though there’s something dubious about the idea that black still conveys evil in our culture, pop or otherwise (tell it to Batman and Barack Obama,  for starters), the idea of messing with Spider-Man’s squeaky-clean profile, smearing it with dirt, a touch of naughtiness, seems too good to resist.  It’s also too good to be true. There’s no knowing if the problem is bottom-line reserve, or a lack of imagination or creative nerve, but Spider-Man’s voyage into darkness turns out to be little more than an overnighter. The goo transforms Spider-Man, but the alteration barely registers. There’s some wacky, misguided nonsense involving Peter’s super-inflated ego and Mr. Raimi’s apparent desire to direct a musical, as well as fleeting nastiness with a resurrected foe, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), recently escaped from prison. Marko has the makings of a super-antagonist,  and Mr. Church brings a touching delicacy to the few short scenes in which you can see his face, the skin pulled back so tightly that you fear his jagged cheekbones might pierce right through.  With his hard-body physique and a striped shirt that evokes a 1930s chain gang, Marko also feels and looks like a fugitive from an earlier era, one of the film’s many such nostalgic flourishes. Marko’s earthbound trudge makes it seem as if he’s dragging a literal ball and chain, not just the baggage of a sick daughter and a cranky missus (Theresa Russell, in and out like the Flash). And when he rises from a bed of sand after a “particle atomizer” scrambles his molecules, his newly granulated form shifts and spills apart, then lurches into human form with a heaviness that recalls Boris Karloff staggering into the world as Frankenstein’s monster. There’s poetry in this metamorphosis, not just technological bravura, a glimpse into the glory and agony of transformation.  It’s this combination of exaltation and dread that can come with radical life change that made the first film work as well as it did. The first “Spider-Man” never soared, but there was something very appealing about the image of a skinny, geeky adolescent struggling to rise to the occasion of his newfound powers, like a 97-pound weakling tiptoeing on the beach after getting with the Charles Atlas program. Part of the allure of superheroes, of course, is how they serve as wish fulfillments for the faithful, allowing their mild-mannered fans to settle scores and snare the babe by proxy. But nothing seems to put a damper on interesting self-doubt faster than fame, or so this film and its lead character both seem intent on proving.  Success may not have spoiled Mr. Raimi as it has Peter Parker, but it seems as if it has zapped his gracious good humor, which was so critical to the first two films. The story this time unfolds as a series of increasingly dreary and teary melodramatic encounters regularly interrupted by special-effects-laden fights. As it happens, the over-all shape does recall a Busby Berkeley musical — snappy story, lavish number, snappy story, lavish number — but without the snap or fun. Peter ignores his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), so she reaches out to her friend and his frenemy, Harry Osborn (James Franco), a k a Son of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe, revived in flashback), while Peter turns to his Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), who shovels the manure with grace.  And so it goes as the Sandman  cometh and goeth and a twerp named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace, running fast with a small role) throws a couple of monstrous hissy fits. Bryce Dallas Howard shows up to smile at the camera, as does a marvelous Bruce Campbell, who almost swallows it whole. Ms. Dunst looks a bit lost, at times even bereft, but you want to catch hold of her story line and follow her home. When she tramps across the screen, this wispy, sad-eyed beauty turns into Melancholy Girl, able to melt hearts in a single glance.  For his part Mr. Maguire needs to stop relying on those great big peepers of his: simply widening your eyes to attract attention does not cut it when you’re over 30.  It’s hard not to think that Mr. Raimi would rather follow Ms. Dunst to wherever her story might take them too. And while Marko is mainly around to show off the franchise’s snazzy special effects, it feels as if the director has put quite a bit of himself into the Sandman, whose struggle to find a form that suits his talents has the sting of a metaphor. The bittersweet  paradox of this franchise is that while the stories have grown progressively less interesting the special effects have improved tremendously, becoming at once more plausible — when Spider-Man swings through the urban canyons he finally looks almost real — and more spectacular. In Sandman you see the vestiges of Mr. Raimi’s personal touch slipping through a nearly empty hourglass.  “Spider-Man 3” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Some gun violence and blood, but mostly lots of zap, pow, wham.

The three main recurring characters get stuck in a rut and the same can be said of the film itself in "Spider-Man 3." After the significant improvement of the second installment over the first, new entry reps a roughly equivalent dip in quality and enjoyment, with Spidey now giving off the faint odor of running on fumes. This devaluation shouldn't hurt at the box office, at least at first, as the vast majority of the fans who turned the first two into $822 million and $784 million worldwide grossers, respectively, will cram multiplexes around the globe to see the first blockbuster of the summer.
A sense of strain envelops the proceedings this time around. One can feel the effort required to suit up one more time, come up with fresh variations on a winning formula and inject urgency into a format that basically needs to be repeated and, due to audience expectations, can't be toyed with or deepened very much.
Big problem with third Spideyis the script, the very same element that elevated the second yarn. Four years back, vet scenarist Alvin Sargent, with a story assist from Michael Chabon, enriched the premise from all angles -- emotion, humor and villainy. This time, the magic has eluded Sargent and the Raimi brothers, director Sam and co-writer Ivan, the result being a story that would have provenmore satisfactory for a late '60s cartoon-hero TV show than for a new-century blockbuster.
At the outset, everything is so hunky-dory that New York City looks like Pleasantville. Thanks to Spider-Man, crime is virtually non-existent, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is a burgeoning musical theater star, and Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), still studying science at college, is dorkier than ever.
But evil begins to reassert itself on several fronts. As Peter and Mary Jane gaze at the stars from their spider-web hammock overlooking the city, a modest "War of the Worlds"-like meteor crashes nearby and emits a gooey black silk that slithers and slides of its own accord.
A hard-outside/soft-inside criminal (Thomas Haden Church), who turns out to have been responsible for the murder of Peter's beloved Uncle Ben, escapes from prison and, through a process that defies comprehension but is undeniably eye-catching, turns into a shape-changer named Sandman who can blow through the caverns of Manhattan or become a giant hulk with fearsome pummeling power.
And then there is Harry Osborn (James Franco), who, still blaming Spider-Man for the death of his father, decides to emulate the great green one by engineering a new designer Goblin outfit and flying board and taking to the skies to avenge his old man.
Peter acquires yet another adversary in the person of Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), an aggressive street photographer who vies with Peter to capture the revelatory shot that will reveal Spider-Man for who he really is, a coup that will land the winner a full-time job from editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) at the Daily Bugle. The rivalry turns into outright war when Eddie morphs into one more Marvel supervillain, the fanged Venom, whose skills eerily match those of Spidey.
Early going is enlivened by a couple high-wire action sequences, a Goblin attack and especially a vertigo-inducing scene in which an out-of-control construction crane demolishes part of a nearby skyscraper, sending platinum blonde Gwen (Bryce Dallas Howard), a classmate of Peter's, heading toward the pavement, only to be saved at the last second by guess who.
But the dramatic temperature is brought way down by Mary Jane, who's become a real drag. Fired, in a poor scene, from her Broadway play, she pathetically begs for attention, becomes petulant when Spidey plants a public kiss on Gwen after saving her, then seeks solace from Harry. 
In all his dealings with her, Peter still acts like the prim, naive high school kid he was when first seen in the series five years ago, as if he hadn't learned anything through all his subsequent trials. Scripting of the many domestic scenes between Peter and women, specifically Mary Jane and Rosemary Harris' Aunt May, is very dull and unimaginative.
Script's one big idea is to have Peter/Spidey explore his "dark side," a gambit of tiresome psychological value but with the obvious side benefits of temporarily suspending his goody two-shoes personality and giving him a new, black costume. All the ploy really amounts to is an interlude in which Peter struts around Gotham with a trendy new haircut ogling women and humiliating Mary Jane with some aggressive nightclub antics.
Given the setup, Spider-Man in the end has to contend with multiple villains in a gigantic action climax that, unfortunately, is too reminiscent of the first film's Roosevelt Island episode thanks to the similar imperilment of Mary Jane. Still, Sandman is a strange and visually interesting baddie endowed by Church with a melancholy undercurrent.
Grace, who could plausibly have played Spider-Man himself, provides a spark with something extra as Spidey's first major adversary his own age.
Technically, pic is fully on a par with the previous entries, which means the visual effects will have fans wide-eyed throughout.

The best that can be said of Spider-Man 3  is that it sheds some light on the whole skinny black jeans phenomenon. Rest easy Hedi Slimane  and residents of the 11211, the origin of overpriced mantyhose may now be attributed to the nefarious agenda of intergalactic goo.
Canoodling under the stars one improbably clear night, Peter Parker  (Tobey Maguire ) and Mary Jane Watson  (Kirsten Dunst ) fail to notice the nearby plummet of a tiny asteroid bearing immense sartorial implications. A peevish obsidian liquid leaks out on impact, oozing its way toward Parker's moped, soon to transform the mild-mannered Forest Hills  dork into a monochromatic hipster sporting asymmetrical bangs, black eyeliner, and calf-hugging trousers. Our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man has become . . . MisShaped!
Meanwhile, escaped convict Flint Marko  (Thomas Haden Church ) flees from authorities in khakis and a green-striped T-shirt purchased on sale at Banana Republic  circa 1996. Inadvertently stumbling into a "Particle Physics Test Facility," Marko finds his molecular structure fused with a pile of sand. Beware the fearsome power of beige! Enter the Sandman and much overwrought CGI.
Elsewhere, Parker gets it into his head that Marko was responsible for his beloved uncle's murder and goes all Turn to the Dark Side. This doesn't sit well with Aunt May (Rosemary Harris). "Revenge is like a poison that can take us over," she intones, ever more Yoda-like as the years go by. Meanwhile, pretty boy Harry Osborn  (James Franco ) revenges his father's death by leaping on his tricked-out snowboard and chucking grenades at Spider-Man. Taking a fall, Harry goes unconscious only to wake up with plot-enabling amnesia.
Meanwhile, elsewhere, MJ suffers humiliating notices for her screeching debut in the Broadway production of Manhattan Memories  and slumps off to wait tables at a jazz club only to be smacked in the face by the newly aggro Parker. Elsewhere, meanwhile, ambitious shutterbug Eddie Brock  (Topher Grace ) attempts to wrest a Daily Bugle  staff gig away from Parker, Sandman is robbing banks, Osborn is getting his memory back, MJ is moping, Aunt May is intoning, Peter is wrestling with his demons, and Eddie gets infected with the goo. Meanwhile . . .
The 3  in Spider-Man 3  is no exaggeration. Everything's been tripledto diminishing effect. There are three times the villains, three times the backstories, three times the psychological baggage, three times the special effects, three times the soul-searching, three times the webslinging, three times the three-cheers-for-New York, three times the desperation to entertain. Given that Spider-Man 2  was twice as fun as the first, it's triply disappointing what an overwrought bore S3 turns out to be.
Dunst now rivals Scarlett Johansson  as the most useless ingenue in Hollywood . Maguire's perky persona is wearing as thin as his lips. As for Grace, I couldn't get past his queasy, Coppertone  skin color and super-shellacked hair, though I dug his transformation into the snaggle-toothed arch-nemesis Venom. His unfortunate marginalizationVenom is the most underused villain since Darth Maul may have been a by-product of the overstuffed plot, but there's no excusing his climactic vanquishing by the impromptu manipulation of a tuning fork.
Three hundred million dollarsthe rumored budget of this feeble monstrositybuys an awful lot of special effects, but why are the ones here so awful? The hysterical more-is-more stylings of Spider-Man 3  extends to the action, fuzzing the geometric swing of its predecessors in a frenzied blur of obstacle-fraught, omnidirectional mayhem. With endless cash and infinite processing power at his disposal, director Sam Raimi  has forgotten the economy of clean lines.
Raimi's finest franchise moment was a throwaway flourish from Spiderman 2 . Swooping up from a digital dip through the Manhattan canyons, Spidey lets out a gleeful yippie! , voicing the goofy kick shared by filmmakers, character, and audience alike. The corollary in Spider-Man 3 is a sad bit of meta-commentary offered up during one of the big set pieces (telling that I can't remember which one), a reaction shot of two young boys gasping awesome! and wicked cool!  I'm not sure what's more patheticthe desperate note of self-congratulation or the fact that the only circumstance in which a 10-year-old New Yorker would utter the phrase "wicked cool" is when prompted by the script of a clueless baby boomer. A certain twee anachronism has always been part of the Spider-Man  traditionditto dexterous, old-fashioned fun. But this summer's first obligatory blockbuster is all thumbs.
