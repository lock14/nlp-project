 You would think by now that mean girls and alpha males would have figured out that no good can ever come from picking on the weird chick, especially if she's in the habit of tacking spooky drawings in her locker and shuffling tarot cards on lunch break. Having failed to learn the lessons of history, bullies are doomed to repeat their mistakes: they will inevitably inflict one too many humiliations on the homely girl, triggering a full-scale makeover and sassy supernatural backlash. Next time, they would do well to study "Carrie" and dip into "Clueless." Having done so, they can cut class on "Tamara" day.  A low-budget horror film with even lower ambitions, "Tamara" is a movie of few innovations but one genuine, if unintentional, surprise. The titular role is filled, in a red bustier, by Jenna Dewan, who plays a wallflower squashed in a prank gone wrong, only to be resurrected as a sorceress of great evil and total foxiness. Tamara is more or less credible as she metes out revenge, enchanting former classmates so they will enact her nefarious whims, but she comes up short in her character's most crucial aspect: the ability to storm down hallways in high heels. I feared more for her equilibrium than for her victims. Of all the terrible things they are compelled  to do to themselves — slice off ears, gnaw off fingertips, chew on glass — the one act deemed so gruesome by the filmmakers that it can't be shown in the same gory detail as the rest is a bit of hypnosis-induced lovemaking between two straight dudes. The horror!  "Tamara" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The movie has gore, cussing, underage drinking and ill-fitting, skimpy outfits.
Tamara , written by Final Destination  scribe Jeffrey Reddick , is a Carrie  knockoff that survives solely on the repetitive pleasures of genre. Our gal Tam (Jenna Dewan ) is a dowdy Wiccan who pines after her sensitive English teacher (Matthew Marsden ) and is repeatedly sassed by 'roided-up jocks and the ladies who love them. A cruel prank goes awry, and Tam gets snuffed. Rising from the grave in a fab miniskirt ensemble (death also does wonders for her complexion), revenge is tops on her to-do list, albeit sapped of Carrie's sexualized obsessions. The actors are harshly lit and poorly blocked, nervously loitering until they're cued to panic. The performances are wildly inconsistent, but Dewan and Katie Stuart  (Tam's punk friend Chloe) emote petulance and sobriety, respectively, with calm professionalism. It's not all drossthe film studiously avoids glorifying the revenge killings by switching our sympathies to Chloe once the blood begins to spill in a grueling take of on-air self-mortification. Genre jolts arise in spite of stylistic failures, wringing familiar tingles from empty corridors and narrow escapes that echo richer scares from more resourceful movies.The Leopard Man , anyone?
