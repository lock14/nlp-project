One might think that characters who have the mental quickness to count cards and take the Vegas blackjack tables for tens of thousands of dollars a pop would also have the acumen to notice that some aspects of their caper just don't add up. Maybe they're just flawed movie characters, or maybe they're seduced by the rush of their big score and the dazzle of the Vegas lifestyle. That's what the filmmakers are counting on, anyway, as they take a pass on character development in favor of fluttery Vegas montages of cards, lights, money, and pretty, young faces in thrall to the gods of self-made fortunes and striking it rich. Adapted from Ben Mezrich's true account of similar events, Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions
, the film is more interested in the artifice and the hustle than in the "true story" aspects and reasons why a Harvard Medical School admittee, who professes that he's only in it for the $300,000 needed to finance his education, just doesn't apply for a student loan like everybody else. In addition to the gaps in the screenplay by Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb, director Luketic (Monster-in-Law
, Legally Blonde
) has a plodding approach to the events that make the movie feel like a good 20 minutes could disappear and only affect 21
 for the better. Problems start at the very beginning, when the film opens clumsily with two separate framing episodes that are returned to later in the film. Sturgess, who was so delicious as the John Lennon manque in Across the Universe
 also stands out here as Ben Campbell, the aforementioned pre-med M.I.T. whiz who becomes the cock of the casinos. Spacey, whose Trigger Street Productions is one of the film's producers, digs into his role as the story's snarky mastermind and lure, yet it's all the kind of stuff we've seen him deliver in so many movies before. Fishburne, too, is interesting as the casino security capo, and is the only character here who has some backstory to build a character with. 21
 shares with the Las Vegas mythos the same stale temptations: empty glitz and little substance.


Movie critics have their own way of counting cards. When characters in a Hollywood movie do something that feels true and freshly observed, the count goes +1. When they behave tritely, spout cliches, and generally act as if the screenwriters understand life only from other movies, we're -1. A lovemaking montage that dissolves from one gauzy, disembodied limb to another? -10.
By any fair count, "21" is -372, and that's a shame, since a lot of people were holding out high hopes for this one. Recent converts to the neo-Vegas gambling craze craved the buzz they get from drawing a skeet flush. Readers of the film's nonfiction source, Ben Mezrich's "Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions," wanted the book's grubby little details. Fans of British actor Jim Sturgess hoped the dreamy "Across the Universe" star would ascend to the next rung of fame. MIT alums looked forward to seeing their campus on screen.
Me, I just wanted a decent card movie, and it didn't even have to be as good as "Rounders."
But everyone gets dealt a stiff hand in this bust from director Robert Luketic ("Legally Blonde," "Monster-in-Law") and writers Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb. "21" spins a hackneyed, shallow morality tale about the rise and fall of a young Boston innocent named Ben Campbell (Sturgess, tripping awkwardly over a generic American accent), an MIT undergrad who's desperate to come up with the tuition for Harvard Med.
Building a competition-winning robocar with his nerd friends (Josh Gad and Sam Golzari) won't do the trick, but then Ben, a born numbers adept, is invited to join a secret campus blackjack club led by a Mephistophelean professor played by Kevin Spacey. That's right, ham's on the menu at the MIT cafeteria.
If only there were more of it. Pleasant in a watery sort of way, Sturgess evinces little of the feckless charm he showed in "Universe." Worse, his chemistry with Kate Bosworth, as a beauteous, blond fellow member of the card-counting club, is less than zero. The team members meet by night, test their strategy in underground Chinatown gambling dens - does Governor Patrick know about this? - and fly to Vegas on the weekends for delirious jags of running the numbers and the winnings up.
As with all morality tales, we're shown the benefits of high-rolling - the clothes! the luxury suites! the soft-focus sex! - and then solemnly informed it's bad for us. Ben's head swells and lessons must be learned. Gunning for the students and their mentor is Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), an old-school Vegas security chief with an even older school name. Perversely, "21" gives Fishburne and Spacey, two of our most enjoyably overripe thespians, only one scene together.
But wait - there's more. Disappointment No. 1: The details of card-counting are skimped. A classroom example is trotted out early in the film - the old game-show probability paradox - but it's not explained very well and the scenes at the blackjack tables don't clear it up. Maybe the gambling industry has a stake in this movie? Maybe the filmmakers just think we're stupid?
Disappointment No. 2: Ethnics go to the back of the bus. The name of the hero of Mezrich's nonfiction bestseller, "Kevin Lewis," was an alias for student Jeff Ma; the real MIT team was primarily Asian-American. "21" waves the wand and turns them into three Anglos, one idiot klepto Korean-American (Aaron Yoo), and Kianna (Liza Lapira), a mixed-race woman who seems far and away the smartest person here.
Disappointment No. 3: MIT looks suspiciously like Boston University. Wait, it is Boston University. Not a deal breaker, but indicative of the movie's lack of interest in local realism, despite appearances by the South Street Diner and a corner in Chucktown. Any film that begins with a shot of a racing shell on the Charles is off to a bad start.
Disappointment No. 4: Spacey phones it in. Often entertainingly, and you grasp at his heavy-lidded sarcasm as though it were a life raft, but this isn't a real movie and he knows it. Vapid and over-edited, "21" is a studio concoction that doesn't even have the courage of its own cynicism. By the time the end credits roll around, you realize nothing's actually been risked. It's the gambling equivalent of Go Fish.
The movie's chief audience, consequently, will probably be gullible and young, responding to the cliches only because they haven't seen them before. They have a word in Vegas for these people: Suckers.

These days, a lot of young actors are too attractive, or at least too confidently invested in the powers of their teenybop charisma, to do a convincing job of playing anyone ''normal.'' They may look great in tabloid party photographs, but when they're required to suffer or to show anxiety  that is, when they have to behave like the rest of us  they're like automatons who've been to acting class. They turn imperfection into dull posing.
Jim Sturgess, the star of the college-brainiacs-go-to-Vegas drama 21 , is in a different league. It's not that he isn't cute. He looks a little like the young Paul McCartney (that must be part of why they cast him in Across the Universe ), with a boy heartthrob's dewy eyes and friendly, puckered grin. In 21 , though, he attaches real live nerve endings to that pretty-boy facade. He plays Ben Campbell, a math nerd at MIT who's recruited, by a wry Mephistopheles of a faculty member (Kevin Spacey), to join a secret team of student blackjack wizards who head to Las Vegas on weekends to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars by counting cards. Sturgess wears his hair in a longish, haphazard cut that's like a floppy helmet. It's the armor of a kid who's shy about everything but his intelligence. As Ben, he's passive and slightly dorky, a gummy collegiate tangle of sweetness, IQ, and loser psychology. Ben hangs out with a couple of geeks (together they're building a robot), and he takes it as a fact that girls, or at least the hot ones, aren't interested in him. But when he sits down at the blackjack tables, that very hesitancy  his reluctance to reveal himself  works for him. His brainy reserve becomes cool, a way of negotiating risk. He's a Will Hunting who turns into James Bond.
I've never quite gotten how counting cards in blackjack works, but 21 , which is loosely based on the book Bringing Down the House , about the experiences of MIT student Jeff Ma and his junior-gambler colleagues, constructs an entertaining, if simplified, version of the strategy, to the point that some viewers may be tempted to use the movie as a primer. Under the tutelage of math-and-stats professor Micky Rosa, played by Spacey with his familiar  but always bracing  joy-buzzer sarcasm, Ben joins the other students in an elaborate system that involves assigning a number to each table based on how many low (or high) cards have been dealt. One team member, usually a girl, is there to signal when a table ''heats up'' (i.e., when most of the high cards have yet to be played). At that point, a designated Big Player can sit down and start winning.
21  is built around some standard-issue plot mechanics, but it's still a clever and novel card-sharp thriller. It draws us into Ben's excitement at a luxe dreamworld that trumps college. For Ben, the blackjack team is the means to an end, the only way he has of making the $350,000 he'll need to attend Harvard Medical School. What the audience sees is that the danger of walking into a Vegas casino to beat the system gets him more jazzed than he can admit. High on his big winnings, he starts to get high on everything else too, like the attention of a sexy teammate  Kate Bosworth as an ice princess at full melt. (Bosworth makes her lusciousness vivid in an underwritten role.) He's high on sin. Counting cards is, in fact, perfectly legal. If the casinos catch you, however, they'll kick you out  or, as the film keeps reminding us, break your nose. And since the ability to count cards is truly a skill, not just a way of cheating (it is, of course, the fabled essence of what makes a great poker player), Ben is lying  and not lying. He occupies a gray area of the sleaze zone that, in the movie's terms, is a metaphor for his ambivalence about being a player in life. He desires it and fears it.
21  is a better realized youth thriller than, say, Disturbia , but it has more things to niggle at than it should. When Ben gets to Vegas, he and the other students are given disguises and fake identities, but the movie barely follows through on this gambit  a missed opportunity. And there's a key turning point when Spacey's prof, who seems mostly amused at the scam that he's orchestrating, blows up at Ben in a way I never bought. Despite its shortcomings, however, 21  has enough good twists to keep jolting ahead. It's too early to tell if Jim Sturgess is going to turn into Ryan Gosling or Andrew McCarthy, but my bet is that he gets closer to the former. The fun of 21  is the way that this sharp, hyperaware star in the making, his face as readable as a mood ring, pours us into an adrenalized cocktail of fear, desire, and mental buzz.

Greed is good and comes without a hint of conscience in “21,” a feature-length bore about some smarty-pants who take Vegas for a ride. Loosely based on the nonfiction book “Bringing Down the House” by Ben Mezrich, and adapted for the screen by Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb, this bankrupt enterprise asks you to care about a whiny M.I.T. moppet, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess, serviceable), who because he can’t afford Harvard Medical School (boo hoo), starts counting cards to rake in some serious cash. The conduit to Ben’s journey of counterfeit self-discovery is a racially, ethnically, sexually balanced gang of other greedy bright things (the most appealing being Aaron Yoo, wasted as the kooky, sexless Asian guy),  run by an equally avaricious math professor, Micky  Rosa (Kevin Spacey on autopilot). Using a system of mnemonic devices, goofy hand signals and  a  talent for numbers, the team has devised a way to beat the bank. (In Las Vegas, Laurence Fishburne and his knuckles will have something to say about that.) Because Ben doesn’t want to use his poor widowed mother’s savings to go to Harvard, he decides to ditch his qualms if not his sense (because he really has none) and signs on. And so it’s off to Vegas they go, where they count the cards, take the money and run. Amid the din and glare of various casinos, the director Robert Luketic, whose credits include “Legally Blonde,” engages in other dodgy business: he cribs from Wong Kar-wai’s “Chungking Express” period (Ben sits motionless as the world races by); borrows from  the David Fincher  of  “Fight Club” (camera tricks for kicks); lifts from Martin Scorsese’s “Casino” (throw the money in the air  like  you just don’t care); and pays homage to universal whoredom by restaging the “Pretty Woman” shopping montage. He also tosses in some gleaming rides,  a couple of PG-13 pole dancers and a Rolling Stones remix that both Dad and the kids can enjoy. Ben ogles the chintzy glamour and the chesty blondes spilling out of their dresses, and the movie does exactly the same. He particularly likes it when his skinny school crush, Jill, clambers aboard and offers him a lap job, for which I hope the young actress Kate Bosworth was well compensated. Like everything else in “21,” Jill can be bought for the right price, as of course can Ben and, by extension, us. The filmmakers try to soften this idea mostly by furnishing Ben with a sob story. They turn his desire to attend Harvard into something tantamount to an inalienable right, one that’s impervious to ethical standards or personal morals,  which  means that “21” is either a very cynical or a very smart take on the power elite. “21” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Most of the on-screen lust is for money.

A flashy fictionalization of an extraordinary true-life story about college kids who counted cards to win big in Las Vegas, "21" is a better-than-even-money bet to be an important player in the spring B.O. tournament. Pic shrewdly shuffles together attractive young leads, cagey screen vets and a fantasy-fulfillment scenario in a slickly polished package that should appeal to anyone who's ever dreamed of beating the odds. Only the lack of some truly megawatt star power might hold the Sony release back from a massive, rather than just lucrative, payday.
Sporting a reasonably convincing Boston accent, Brit up-and-comer Jim Sturgess ("Across the Universe") makes a mostly winning impression as Ben Campbell, a brilliant, boyishly cute but awkwardly shy math-and-science whiz who wants to attend Harvard Medical School after completing his senior year at MIT. Trouble is, neither he nor his widowed mom (Helen Carey) can afford tuition.
So it doesn't take much convincing to lure Ben onto a clandestine team of fellow MIT brainiacs assembled by Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey), a seductively snarky math professor and stats genius who presides over his college classes like a sardonic gameshow host. With a little help from sexy student Jill (Kate Bosworth), Mickey convinces Ben to join the high-stakes action while following the professor's near-infallible system for counting cards at blackjack tables during weekend jaunts to Las Vegas.
The gameplan calls for a designated "big player" -- either Ben or vet teammate Fisher (Jacob Pitts) -- to wait for a signal from a "spotter" making low-wager bets. When one of the spotters -- teammates Jill, Choi (Aaron Yoo) and Kianna (Liza Lapira) -- indicates the dealer is working with a "hot deck," the big player comes by and bets big. And keeps on betting, until the spotter signals him to vamoose.
Like a more conventional caper movie, "21" generates an impressive amount of suspense simply by meticulously explaining, and then deftly dramatizing, the nuts and bolts of an illicit enterprise. Spacey is darkly comical and icily authoritative as Mickey explains the rules of his game and repeatedly warns against getting too excited in the heat of the moment.
Mickey makes it perfectly clear to his players that, if they break his rules, they'll be brutally punished. But perhaps not as brutally as they might be treated by Cole Williams (an intimidating Laurence Fishburne), a badass casino "enforcer" who takes a hands-on approach to discouraging card counters.
Working from "Bringing Down the House," Ben Mezrich's bestselling account of the real-life MIT students who took Vegas for millions in the 1990s, director Robert Luketic ("Legally Blonde," "Monster-in-Law") and scripters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb sporadically resort to predictable character developments, logic-stretching plot twists and full-bore melodramatics. It's never made clear how it's so easy for Mickey to impose his iron will on a player who displeases him in the third act, and Ben's evolution from buttoned-down nerd to "Viva Las Vegas" libertine, while amusing, is not entirely plausible in the way it's dramatized (or, to be more accurate, announced) here.
Sturgess does a first-rate job sustaining the aud's rooting interest in his character, even though there's conspicuously little heat to his scenes with the well-cast Bosworth. Spacey gives a performance that could be labeled "Honey-Baked" and sliced up for sandwiches -- which is precisely what makes him so much fun. Supporting players, including Josh Gad and Sam Golzari as Ben's uber-nerd best buddies, are aces.
The visual-effects team led by Gray Marshall employs all manner of camera techniques and CGI trickery to give many of the blackjack games the pizzazz of a state-of-the-art vidgame. (Cards and chips appear exhilaratingly surreal in massive closeups.) And that comes in very handy whenever Luketic wants to amp up the excitement during sequences where, really, people are doing nothing more dramatic than placing bets and playing cards.
Lenser Russell Carpenter enhances pic overall with stark contrasts between snowy Boston and neon-lit Vegas locations. Soundtrack abounds with aptly chosen pop tunes, although the closing credits are underscored by what may be the worst remix of a Rolling Stones song ("You Can't Always Get What You Want") ever heard in a major motion picture.
