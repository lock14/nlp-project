 A ‘what went wrong?’ documentary bristling with answers, “...So Goes the Nation” is a clear-eyed and utterly ruthless dissection of the battle for Ohio in the months leading up to the 2004 presidential election. Zeroing in on the strategic decisions of both major parties, the directors, James D. Stern and Adam Del Deo, illuminate not only the putative blunders of the Kerry-Edwards campaign but also the larger difficulties of the Democratic Party itself. It’s not pretty, but it is instructive.  Facing in President Bush an incumbent burdened by a 48 percent approval rating and an unpopular war in Iraq, Senator John Kerry had “probably 20 different ways he could have won,” says the former Clinton adviser Paul Begala. “And he refused to execute on any of them.”  Instead, the campaign is shown juggling multiple messages and lacking a cohesive field strategy. (One particularly painful sequence for Democrats contrasts the door-to-door efforts of volunteers from both camps.) Fatally ignoring both the accusations of the Swift Boat Veterans and the concerns of so-called values voters, Senator Kerry watches as his every misstep is recycled into a Republican attack ad.  Meanwhile, over at the Bush-Cheney campaign, Republicans are fashioning a clear message of steadfastness versus “flip-flopping” and repeating it with terrifying efficiency. Backed by Reaganesque images of the president chopping wood on his Texas ranch, the campaign cannily exploits fears of terrorism and same-sex marriage to encourage “passive Republicans” to join the cause. They do, and the rest is history. But instead of assuming a fetal position, Democrats might consider  “... So Goes the Nation” less as the opening of an old wound and more as a manual for 2008.  ...

Documentary filmmakers James D. Stern and Adam Del Deo crisscrossed Ohio during the 15 days before the 2004 presidential election hoping to cover a breaking story on voter fraud. They emerged with a very different movie, "... So Goes the Nation," about the underlying strategies that can determine victory or defeat. Combining testimony by leading political gurus from both sides with coverage of voters and volunteers, "Nation" posits a campaign sabotaged as much by ineptitude as by savvier opposition. Neither newly revelatory nor formally innovative, docu's even-handed style cannily enables IFC's simultaneous Oct. 4 release in theaters and on cable.
For those who were either too elated or too demoralized to follow the postmortems, pic offers a concise overview of the general consensus of what went right or wrong -- depending on your point of view -- with Democrats and Republicans surprisingly in accord on many major points. 
By contrasting hindsight commentary with the immediate excitement and suspense of the race, the filmmakers are able to neatly organize (some might argue too programmatically) what real-time television coverage could only messily juggle. 
Stern and Del Deo recap the general tenor of Democratic candidate John Kerry's approach with judiciously chosen clips of key images, tracing how those images were subverted and retooled by President Bush's machine into negative ads, complete with flip-flop props and slogans. 
Expert insights are provided by four high-ranking officials from each camp: campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill, communications director Tad Devine, Democratic National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe and consultant Paul Begala for the blue team; chief strategist Matthew Dowd, media director Mark McKinnon, Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie and campaign manager Ken Mehlman for the red team. 
The filmmakers also follow three volunteers. It becomes clear that the two parties, in their attempts to sway the all-important Ohio constituency, employed philosophically antithetical political tactics. While the Democrats pursued the ever-elusive swing voter, the Republicans sought to deepen their own base, delivering thousands of extra rural and Bible Belt adherents to the polls.
Pic retains just enough of its initial mandate to render its offhand citations of voter fraud somewhat disingenuous. The filmmakers cover irregularities at the polls, and the insufficient number of voting machines in Democratic districts with large black populations. But the widespread allegations of fixed voting machines, admittedly impossible to verify, pass completely unmentioned. 
Some of pic's best one-liners come from Paul Begala, who marvels aloud how Bush can possibly get away with his prefab folksiness: "If he's a Texas rancher, I'm a Hassidic diamond merchant." 
He also bemoans Kerry's lack of a single, simple message: "We�re saying 'JHOS' (jobs, health, oil and security) when their message is 'I'll protect you from people who want to kill you'!" 
Tech credits are undistinguished.

A detailed and somewhat straggling account of the 2004 presidential election's flashpoint climax in Ohio, James D. Stern  and Adam Del Deo's new doc bounces between the day-to-day buildup to Election Day and after-the-fact interviews, searching for answers. The filmmakers wonder how such a counterintuitive political scenario could emerge: the re-election of an incumbent plagued by low approval ratings, amid an economic downturn, rising unemployment, and a disastrous and illegal war. So Goes the Nation  has no new conspiracy theories, settling instead for a meticulous examination of the two political parties' hellbent voter-seduction strategies, from demographic outreach to slam ads. In other words, and despite its well-meaning "fair and balanced" approach barely disguising a Democratic outrage, the movie joins most of the mainstream media in regarding the race as a matter of voter manipulationwhoever suckers the most fools with the simplest and most mercenary tactics wins. "It's got nothing to do with right or wrong," says Republican vote harvester Leslie Ghiz  about the entire persuasive process, moments before she has the temerity to say that the November 1 Bin Laden  video was, for her purposes, "too good to be true." Using gay marriage as a scarecrow for middle-American voters is going too far for the filmmakers, but in general they only seem saddened that the Democrats weren't as wily, amoral, and bullet-headed as the neocons. Perhaps they're right in some fashion, given Bush Inc. 's body count. But isn't reducing the discourse to bad jokes, boogeyman rants, and 30-second TV ads exactly the problem, regardless of who wins? The campaign managers being interviewed make a spectacle of themselves, smugly taking credit for manufacturing every dumbfuck voting rationale ever fed to an undereducated American public. How they live with themselves is a line of questioning braver filmmakers will have to pose.
