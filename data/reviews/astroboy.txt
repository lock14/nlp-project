Osamu Tezuka's pioneering Japanese manga
 and anim� series about the coolest robot kid ever finally achieves Americanized big-screen status. While Mighty Atom
 purists (of which I am one) may mutter that something has been lost in the translation � the inherently futuristic feel of subtitled Japanese dialogue upon a gaijin
's (or foreigner�s) ear is, as any Tezuka fan will enthuse, always preferable over clunky old English � this Astro Boy
 remains true to the heart and soul of the original. The initial origin story emerges relatively unscathed: Brilliant robotics scientist Dr. Tenma (Cage) builds a superpowered nuts �n' bolts copy of Toby (Highmore), his own flesh �n' blood offspring, after the real boy is killed in a tragic accident. Imbuing the robotic doppelg�nger with all of Toby�s memories, the grieving, half-mad dad tries to keep the boy android unaware of his nonhuman reality, but that plan goes awry almost immediately once the new Toby discovers he has jet thrusters in his legs, not to mention superstrength and an iconic haircut and � kickass! � machine guns in his butt. However, once robo-Toby makes the leap from boy to Astro Boy, his father rejects him (not a pleasant sequence or concept for any kid under the age of 10 to watch, but honest to Tezuka's original). Crushed, Astro Boy jets away and ends up falling in with a pack of Earth-surface moppets and their Fagin-esque adult ringmaster, Hamegg (Lane). Tenma and all the other adults live in the very shiny Metro City, which floats high above the surface of the horrifically polluted Earth (shades of WALL-E
). Screenwriter Timothy Harris (Space Jam
) comes up with a few new twists on Tezuka's original � most notably the nascent romance between Astro and plucky surface-dweller Cora (Bell) � and this Astro Boy
 moves along at least as snappily as its rocket-powered protagonist. (There's even a passing reference to Tod Browning's Freaks
 and the philosophy of Immanuel Kant!) But ultimately, as an old-school Astro Boy
 fan and collector who has a 12-inch-high, die-cast resin model of the character staring me in the eye as I type this, Bowers' take on the anim� legend feels too indebted to the far superior The Iron Giant
 and overstreamlined in both story and animation. It's a totally serviceable reboot for young people who are just discovering the joys of manga, but I can't help but miss the raw animation and even rawer emotional aesthetics of the original televised anim� series.

A new “Astro Boy’’? Why not? If the movies can bring Alvin and the Chipmunks back from the pop-culture dead, what’s wrong with digitally reviving a character who deserves
 a second career? Especially when the results are as promising, if as bizarrely conflicted, as this.
The movie actually represents the third iteration, more or less, of the superhero rocket-boy. While most Americans of a certain age remember the animated TV episodes that ran in syndication from 1963 until the sprockets wore out in the early 1970s, “Astro Boy’’ originated in a 1951 Japanese comic book by Osamu Tezuka, the founder of the wide-eyed manga style that now overruns the earth. There have been two other TV versions (1980 and 2003) but the original manga (since translated into English and highly recommended) and the black-and-white TV show are Astro Boy’s twin power sources.
The new movie lifts off from Tezuka and is all the more interestingly weird for it. Set in Metro City, an airborne island paradise hovering high above a ruined Earth, “Astro Boy’’ at first seems a fusion of “WALL-E,’’ “I, Robot,’’ “A.I.: Artificial Intelligence,’’ and one of Hayao Miyazaki’s high-flying fables. Robots of all shapes and kinds serve mankind, and their inventor, Dr. Tenma (voiced by Nicolas Cage), is about to unveil his greatest cyborg yet, a peaceful warrior fueled by blue-core energy from outer space.
Metro City’s hawkish leader, General Stone (Donald Sutherland, having a ball), wants to use the malevolent red-core energy instead, and in the ensuing dust-up, Tenma’s young son Toby (Freddie Highmore) is accidentally killed. The grief-crazed father hits the lab and invents a robot in his child’s image, then spurns it for not being enough like Toby. Exiled, Astro Boy (Highmore again, working that American accent) embarks on a quest to find his identity and/or locate the machine guns in his butt.
OK, then: It’s “Pinocchio’’ with a metaphysical twist, the tale of a puppet who already was a real boy and will never be again. Grounded in this primal origin-story angst, “Astro Boy’’ alternately soars and sputters through a story line that’s not quite sure who it’s aimed at.
For instance: Director/co-writer David Bowers is formerly of Nick Park’s Aardman Animations, and there’s a trio of googly-eyed revolutionary robots that could have come from a “Wallace & Gromit’’ short by way of Monty Python. The second credited screenwriter, though, is Hollywood vet Timothy Harris (“Trading Places,’’ “Kindergarten Cop’’), which probably explains the dully cliched subplot in which Astro Boy falls to Earth and meets a group of Lost Boys (and one teen Lost Girl, who looks like a Bratz doll and is voiced by Kristen Bell). The computer animation, rendered by the Hong Kong-based Imagi Animation, has a pleasing pastel simplicity that sometimes looks iconic and other times just cheap.
The movie comments, in its cartoon way, on fascism, our throwaway culture, and the mistreatment of minorities (the minority being robots), but it also  - and this is critical  - delivers enough of the action movie goods to make your inner 8-year-old say “wicked awesome
’’ at least three or four times. Can that alone restart a franchise? Can “Astro Boy’’ break free of the tentacles of the past and soar into tomorrow? Probably not  - but stay tuned anyway.

In an origin story that's like Pinocchio  meets Frankenstein , Dr. Tenma (voiced by Nicolas Cage), a robotics professor, loses his son, Toby, in a freak energy accident and builds a new kid from scratch: a robot boy with rocket flames that shoot out of his feet and hair molded into a Dennis the Menace cowlick. Astro, as he comes to be known, doesn't just look like Toby; he has the exact same personality (they're both voiced by Freddie Highmore). You could chalk this up to the miracle   of robotics  or, perhaps, to the thinness of characterization that marks this jet-propelled update of the Japanese cartoon series, which in 1963 was an early milestone of anime.
If you're pining for the richness of a Pixar film, or even for the crackerjack comedy of, say, Kung Fu Panda , look elsewhere. Yet the new Astro Boy  is a marvelously designed piece of cartoon kinetics, with the pleasing soft colors and rounded-metal tactility of an atomic- age daydream. Astro gets kicked off Metro City, a spaceship that hovers above Earth, and he lands in a scrap heap of robots and meets some wild-child friends. There's a little too much lost-boys-and-girls mopiness, but when Astro becomes a robot gladiator, the movie turns happy demolition derby, and the virtuoso collisions just keep on coming.


 Look, up in the sky! It’s a bird! It’s a plane! It’s Amelia Earhart! No, it’s the strange, somewhat surreal Astro Boy! Faster than a speeding bullet train, more powerful than an adolescent girl or any other gaga creature that comes at him, the Japanese cartoon robot has made the leap to the big American screen, complete with a golly-gee voice (Freddie Highmore), a handful of obligatory action scenes and the usual celebrity add-ons (Bill Nighy, Nathan Lane).  Newly revived, he is again forced to wage battle against evil and, more troubling, endure some awfully cruel parenting. And so he zips and zags, keeping aloft in a movie that can’t always do the same.  Created just six years after the United States dropped the bomb on  Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Astro Boy — originally named Tetsuwan Atomu, or Mighty Atom — made his debut in a 1951 manga, taking further flight first in a live-action television show and then in a cartoon. (The Mighty Atom  was rechristened Astro Boy when the cartoon hit American TV in  the 1960s.) The character was the invention of  Osamu Tezuka,  a medical student turned manga and anime  visionary  who is widely considered the most important and influential figure in post-World War II Japanese animation. (American children who grew up watching television in the ’60s will fondly remember another of his creations, Kimba the White Lion.)  Directed by  David Bowers, making his solo debut (he was one of two directors on “Flushed Away,” from Aardman Animations), the movie serves as an introduction to Astro Boy and his origin story and, no doubt, a wished-for rebooted franchise. The story, set in an indeterminate future, opens with scenes from the life of a whiz kid, Toby (Mr. Highmore),  the son of a goateed  scientist, Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage). Before you know it, Toby has gone poof in an experiment gone wrong — involving blue energy, red energy, a giant robot and the insinuating voice of Donald Sutherland — leaving behind only a baseball cap and a strand of hair. Dr. Tenma subsequently pulls a Dr. Frankenstein and, voilà: Astro Boy.  When Dr. Tenma rejects the robot boy, heartache follows, along with  adventure and various high and low cultural references, some obvious (“Pinocchio”), others obscure (“Kiss Me Deadly,” another atomic-age artifact). It’s not inapt for a movie that raises the question of human consciousness to drop Descartes  into the mix — Dr. Tenma believes in the classics,  as do  Mr. Bowers and his fellow screenwriter, Timothy Hyde Harris — but it’s a little kooky in such a kiddie-centric  movie. It’s also a throwaway, as are the nods to Lenin and Trotsky that pop up when Astro Boy, after falling to Earth, as all heroes must, encounters the Robot Revolutionary Front. Moments like these seem mostly designed to flatter the grown-ups. (Didn’t work.)  Like a lot of movies, “Astro Boy” has been designed to function on different levels and serve different audiences, but in this case these multiple meanings and points of address have created a confusion of tone. The story’s undertow of darkness pulls you in one direction, while Astro Boy’s insistent cheerfulness, which seems more commercially motivated than personality-driven, pulls you somewhere else. This jaggedness extends to the visual design, which at times intriguingly recalls the flat, graphic style of the 1950s, yet also often looks thinly conceived, sketchy, even cheap. Somewhat more rounded than the original character, Astro Boy, meanwhile, now brings to mind the chubby mascot for  the restaurant chain Big Boy. Maybe the fuller figure is part of his Americanization.  “Astro Boy” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A few of the small children in the theater in which I saw the movie occasionally screamed, but it’s unclear if they were frightened, bored or hungry.

Appropriately for a film about robots, efficiency is the primary virtue of "Astro Boy," a well-oiled CG-animated superhero pic that makes up in competence and vitality what it lacks in originality. Adapted from the classic Japanese toon, this thoroughly Westernized film will likely have little appeal to devotees of the source material, instead targeting tots and borrowing from a variety of recent animated pics. Slated for an Oct. 23 release Stateside, two weeks after opening in Asia,�the film easily should draw sizable family crowds and hold their attention well; whether it sticks in their memory is another question.
The anxiety of influence is a palpable force in "Astro Boy," although it owes just as much to "Wall-E," "The Iron Giant" and "Pinocchio" as it does to its source -- Tezuka Osamu's 1952 manga that spawned multiple cartoon series and bequeathed contemporary anime with a hefty chunk of its DNA. While "Astro Boy" is hardly the equal of any of those, it's nonetheless a cut above this year's thematically and aesthetically similar "Monsters vs. Aliens," displaying flashes of intelligence and a relaxed pace that should please parents who stumbled out of the latter nursing stroboscopically induced migraines.
Action centers around Toby (voiced by Freddie Highmore), a spiky-haired child prodigy who lives in futuristic Metro City, a robot-controlled utopia orbiting high above the Earth, which has become overrun with garbage. Following his scientist father, Dr. Tenma (Nicolas Cage, whose characteristically breathy, marble-mouthed diction proves an odd fit for the character), to an experimental weapons test, Toby is accidentally killed, and the grieving Tenma creates an identical-looking android replacement, complete with Toby's memories and consciousness (as well as the ability to fly and a cache of fearsome weaponry, for reasons left unexplained).
As detailed in a dapper, retro-styled prologue, Metro City's sentient cyborgs are considered little more than disposable slaves, and Tenma goes to lengths to hide Toby's internal circuitry from him. When he catches Toby fraternizing with the house's mechanical help, however, Tenma becomes disenchanted with his creation and cruelly sets the boy loose.
Dropping down to Earth after an awkwardly timed battle with decidedly unscary supervillain President Stone (Donald Sutherland), Toby eventually falls in with a gang of orphaned scavengers who roam the ravaged surface, seeking out scrap metal for their Fagin-like guardian (Nathan Lane). Now calling himself Astro, the boy passes himself off as a fellow traveler and tries to go about fitting in, soon discovering an ability to revive dead robots from the junkyard.
Dark as all this sounds, the PG-rated pic's apocalyptic elements are more than balanced by its moments of levity and strong (though surprisingly subtle for a kidpic) moral undercurrents. The battle and chase scenes are kinetic and exciting without becoming too frightening or manic, and there's little here to upset any but the smallest children. (That this film should merit a PG rating while last year's far more sinister "Tale of Despereaux" skated by with a G defies all reason.)
Script by director David Bowers and Timothy Hyde Harris is mercilessly streamlined in its storytelling, and save for one very unexpected shout-out to Kant, it refrains from aiming too many jokes above its target audience's heads. Supporting characters are well drawn, particularly a band of robot revolutionaries plotting to overthrow their human overlords but hopelessly hampered by Asimov's first law of robotics.
Animation is topnotch yet stylistically inconsistent, veering from bubbly and Wii-like to photorealistic from scene to scene. Other tech contributions are solid all around, with some excellent visual effects and sound design giving the action scenes extra punch.
