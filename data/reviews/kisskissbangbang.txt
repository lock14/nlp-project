The story goes that when screenwriter Shane Black was coming up in Hollywood 15 years ago, he and his housemates used to throw bashes that regularly devolved into precise re-creations of classic fight scenes from Hong Kong action movies on their front lawn. His directorial debut ''Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" takes a similar approach to the hard-boiled detective genre: It's a merry deconstructive delight and easily the best party in town.
It's also a surprisingly confident comeback for Black -- the kid who made millions penning boom-boom buddy films like ''Lethal Weapon" in the late 1980s -- and a blazing return to form for both Robert Downey Jr. and Val Kilmer. ''Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is such a good time that you may not care if it's less than the sum of its fabulously witty parts.
Downey's drug and legal problems are in the past but they've somehow added to his bitter comic authority. Playing petty thief-turned-Hollywood-actor-turned-wannabe-detective Harry Lockhart, Downey narrates his way through the byzantine plot like a man spinning tall tales, occasionally stopping to point out their absurdity. Several times, the film appears to jam in the projector gate while Harry berates himself for missing a key bit of information.
A little of this meta-movie archness goes a long way unless you're an expert juggler, and ''Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is lucky to have a number on board. Lured to LA by a shady producer (Larry Miller) promising him a part, Harry is instructed to stick by the side of private eye Perry Van Shrike, a.k.a. Gay Perry (Kilmer), who dresses in discreetly expensive suits and informs him that real PI work is boring. This is just before a car with a dead woman in its trunk sails over their heads.
There are many more corpses before the film ends, but they seem to pile up almost accidentally, and to Harry's great chagrin. (The one that appears in his hotel bathroom is greeted with an involuntary physical response that's both understandable and really sick.) All he wants to do is get close to Harmony Lane (Michelle Monaghan), the childhood sweetheart who has reappeared, almost magically, as a struggling actress in Gay Perry's orbit. Despite her protests -- and Monaghan doth protest with sly and sensuous charm -- she and Harry are made for each other.
''Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is full of mordantly delicious inside-Hollywood shots: When a woman at a party tells Harry ''I do a little acting," the film cuts to her scene getting decapitated in a Z-grade horror film. There's even a riff on the pharmaceutically fueled home invasion that was Downey's real-life nadir a few years back; the movie suggests this is a normal stage for actors on the slide. Black's equally in love with the tough-guy patter of private eye fiction, but he gives it a playfully shallow spin that lives on the lips of actors and dies on the printed page (meaning it's useless to quote here).
Downey ricochets through ''Kiss Kiss" with aplomb, but Val Kilmer owns the movie as a man who approaches his sexuality with the same dryly rattled professionalism as he approaches his caseload. Gay Perry doesn't really want Harry around -- ''Sleep badly; any questions, hesitate to call," he instructs his partner by way of saying good night -- but he knows a good mystery when someone else bumbles into it. Kilmer's timing here elevates Black's bad-boy dialogue close to the realm of farce, and for those who remember the actor's '80s comedies like ''Real Genius," this is a long-awaited homecoming. (For those who know only the unintentional hilarity of ''Alexander" and ''The Island of Dr. Moreau," Kilmer will be a revelation.)
Much of the fun in ''Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" lies in the piling of event upon surreal event, and while I'm still not sure how that large, friendly dog got in there, its scene is perhaps the movie's black-comedy highpoint. There are shady women in pink wigs, gunmen trying to banter Tarantino-style and failing, an unwanted minor amputation, and bullets that never land where they're meant to.
After a while, though, the seams holding the whole thing together start to come apart, and in the spaces between you see -- nothing. More antic than ''Get Shorty" and less brutally artful than ''Pulp Fiction," ''Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" lacks the lasting impact of either movie, and it continually tiptoes on the edge of smarm. The central mystery is sacrificed to individual scenes; the self-conscious style ultimately nullifies its content. When Elvis makes a brief appearance toward the end, you realize Black's willing to throw just about anything into his stewpot. He has fashioned a dazzling bagatelle that spins faster and faster until it disappears, and while the movie puts him back in the ring, there's only so much pride you can take in glibness.
Maybe that's asking too much. ''Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is a terrific one-night stand, but you may wake up, as Harry does, and wonder exactly who you slept with.

         Given that "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is Shane Black's directorial debut after nearly 20 years as a screenwriter, it's not surprising that the film has the exuberant glee of a kid who's just been let out of detention. A little of this kind of glee, however, goes a longer way than you might expect.
 
  Black, the screenwriter best known for dreaming up the "Lethal Weapon" franchise, is someone who can't resist showing off, and that eventually becomes a problem. It's not that he's not stylish and inventive — he is. But "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" turns into a film that is too ostentatiously pleased with itself, so in love with its own cleverness it doesn't notice it's darn near worn you out.
 


         






    A post-post-modern version of the Los Angeles-based hard-boiled detective story starring the yin and yang team of verbose Robert Downey Jr. and laconic Val Kilmer, "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is first of all filled with popular culture references almost without end.
 
  Its title, for instance, is identical to one critic Pauline Kael cribbed from an Italian poster for an early review collection because it was "perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of movies." The titles of Raymond Chandler novels and short story collections — "The Lady in the Lake," "The Little Sister," "Trouble Is My Business" — are used as visual chapter titles here. Black even names a peripheral character Flicka so someone can refer to "my friend Flicka" and remind us of that barely remembered 1950s TV show.
 
  Just as glib as Black is his protagonist/alter ego Harry Lockhart (Downey at his most engagingly voluble). Introduced at the kind of L.A. party where "if a girl's name is Jill she spells it Jyll," Harry is our guide through the wilder shores of Hollywood.
 
  It's not, we soon learn, his native habitat. A complete fluke, too amusing to give away, has brought this New Yorker to the coast, where a producer is grooming him for a role as a detective. Part of the process has Harry apprentice himself to a real-life detective named Perry van Shrike (Kilmer), nicknamed "Gay Perry" because of his sexual orientation and because Black couldn't resist the sound of the name.
 
  A no-nonsense type (and one of Kilmer's most effective performances) whose motto is "any questions, hesitate to call," Perry insists to Harry that detective work is boring in real life. What happens to this unlikely team when they hook up with Harry's dream girl, Harmony Faith Lane (a lively Michelle Monaghan), is anything but.
 
  For "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" has one of those hyper-complex plots, filled with feints and dodges, corpses and coincidences, that is so self-referentially twisted that Harry feels free to use his voice-over to taunt the audience with a brazen "Have you solved this yet?"
 
  Harry's voice-over work, as he is the first to point out, adds to the confusion. He's forever forgetting to pass on information, stopping the film to confess "I was a bad narrator" and then calling our bluff with a terse "I don't see another narrator, so pipe down."
 
  This kind of show-offy slickness is entertaining for a while, as is Harry's habit of saying things like "I was wetter than Drew Barrymore at a grunge club." But 103 minutes of nonstop glossy patter proves wearing. When Harmony Faith Lane takes a deep breath and says, "this is so exhausting," she speaks for more people than she realizes.

The deliriously enjoyable noir comedy-thriller Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang  does nothing by halves and everything by doubles. Nudge nudge. There's the twofer title, evocative of ripe pulp fiction on page and screen  the same muscular phrase with which the late tough-dame film critic Pauline Kael herself defined the basic appeal of movies. There's the cheeky, talk-bedazzled script by Shane Black, making a sharp directorial debut, who machine-guns twice as many words as the average dialogue slinger (and four times as many killer lines, most of them spilling from the mouth of an on-screen narrator in a stream-of-meta torrent that acknowledges the experience of watching the movie). And the story itself multiplies meanings as it chases the tale of a petty thief, running from the cops down the mean streets of New York City, who is mistaken for an actor wannabe at an audition for a detective movie, then flown out to Tinseltown for a screen test, where he prepares for playing the role of gumshoe by shadowing a tough private eye who goes by the name of Gay Perry, because he is. Gay.
Best of all, Kiss Kiss  offers the double-your-pleasure thrills of watching Robert Downey Jr., at the top of his game playing thief-turned-actor-turned-PI Harry Lockhart, and Val Kilmer, divine as the fabulously macho Gay Perry. The duo make a whole greater than the sum of their parts, a couple of highly flammable actors as famous for their volatile offscreen reputations as for their redoubtable acting chops. And the enjoyment is intense times two, since what gossip pages have already told us about each man adds to our satisfaction in seeing the pair so redeemed by good discipline and good, healthy skin tone.
Downey has played fast-talking, hyper-smart, self-destructive types before  he did an undervalued, dark-side variation on the species in the obsessive remake of The Singing Detective   but his Harry is an apotheosis of the ilk, and in taking him on, the star is at the apex of his charms. (Few mess-prone actors elicit such goodwill from those around him, in part because his talent is so damn abundant.) Kilmer, meanwhile, has never looked like this  so big yet precise, and so at ease with Perry's caustic, intrinsic homosexuality. Anybody armed with Black's sparkling dialogue (created for a character as tough and confident as he is queer) could, I suppose, have lived it up as Gay Perry. But none, I daresay, could have made the splash of the former Batman.
Harry meets a skirt named Harmony Faith Lane (played with panache by star-to-watch Michelle Monaghan), who comes to L.A. looking for stardom, and who gets kicked around, as broads in her condition of ambition sometimes do. And Harry helps her when she gets into a pickle, the two of them bound by a shared devotion to out-of-style dime novels featuring a silky gumshoe called Jonny Gossamer. But really, in the gossamer Hollywood conjured by Kiss Kiss , the character of Harry helps Downey rediscover his shine. Downey helps Kilmer relocate his sparkle. And Black, who first exploded the possibilities of character-driven, buddy-based action flicks two decades ago with his revolutionary script for Lethal Weapon , gets a bang bang out of rehabilitating two of the least likely heroes in Tinseltown.


"Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang" is a stylish, smarty-pants mystery thriller from the way-glib pen of Shane Black. 
In his directorial debut, Black has made a film 
at the 
adrenaline level 
of the manic cop character he wrote for Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon," and the Hollywood setting provides 
an excuse for a wise-ass insider
 tone. Perhaps too clever for its own good and so confusingly dense one is tempted to stop trying to follow the plot and just go along for the ride, Warner Bros. release looks poised for a modest theatrical life, with likely prolonged cult status among hardcore fans in home formats.
Taking its title from James Bond and Pauline Kael, hyperventilating pic has the perfect put-upon lead in Robert Downey Jr. as a no-account New York actor whose ad hoc pose as a private dick on a trip to Los Angeles leads him into very deep and murky water. First seen as an outsider at a chic Hollywood Hills party, Downey's Harry Lockhart explains in playfully confidential narration how he ended up here at the behest of Gay Perry, an upfront and funny character played in what can modestly be termed an extreme change of pace by Val Kilmer; jokey gay banter abounds, which may amuse and bewilder different viewers in equal measure.
Harry also expounds on his forlorn history with a long-lost high-school heartthrob who reportedly got it on with nearly every boy in his small-town Indiana class except for him. So who should catch his eye at the party but a slinky lady who turns out to be the very same woman, Harmony (Michelle Monaghan), now a pulp-fiction aficionado whose sassy rap recaptures Harry's fancy. In the first of several hilarious/awful mishaps that prevent him from finally scoring with her, Harry manages to take Harmony and her plain Jane girlfriend home, only to get so wasted he sleeps with the wrong woman.
As nicely set up as it is, however, the Harry/Harmony reunion presents a major problem, simply because Downey looks about 15 years older than Monaghan, with both characters briefly repped by child actors of the same age; the issue continues to dog the film throughout.
Party and club talk is so deft and mordant you get the feeling Black could write it all night, and nobody could deliver it better than Downey, with a deadpan, sometime sad-sack tone that contains a delicious mix of self-deprecation and bad-boy impudence.
But not content to toss off one-upping dialogue at a dizzying clip, Black must finally get around to laying out a plot, and here things get quickly tangled.
While waiting for what he hopes will be a career-altering movie role, Harry gets into the sleuthing business. It's all far too complicated to explain, even if you could; Gay Perry gives it a go at the very end, and only affirms the inscrutability of the yarn in the process. But it involves Harry's discovery of a succession of female corpses, the identities of which are jumbled; Harmony egging him on to solve the mysteries because she's convinced he's a detective; Harry and Perry bickering while they help each other out of jams; Harry becoming detached from the same finger twice; significant humor stemming from the location where Perry carries a secret Derringer; a reasonably outrageous action climax set on a freeway overpass; and an epilogue cut short as Harry reassures, "Don't worry, I saw 'Lord of the Rings.' I'm not going to end this 17 times."
To no particular point other than paying homage where homage is due, pic is divided into five chapters named after Raymond Chandler titles, beginning with "Trouble Is My Business" and concluding with "Farewell My Lovely."
Once again making a diverting but insubstantial movie look better than it is, Downey, with haggard charm to burn, is winning all the way. Kilmer is riotous at times as an impeccably groomed, businesslike guy keen to assert his orientation at every opportunity. Monaghan handles the cascading dialogue with aplomb but can't eradicate the sense of mismatch with Downey.
Visual style is enjoyably nimble and slick, and musical choices are smart.

Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang  is a calling-card movie that invites you to enjoy, and even participate in, the comeback of writer-director Shane Black : To watch this frantic exercise in smartass violence is to watch a hyperactive slapstick comic perform emergency resuscitation on his own career.
Hero of the go-go '80s, Black embodied a particular Hollywood  fantasythe screenwriter as rock star. He sold his first script fresh out of UCLA , inventing the Lethal Weapon  franchise at age 23. None of his subsequent screenplays had nearly the same impact, but Black's wunderkind reputation enabled him to set records with his megabuck paydays for strenuously ironic action comedies like The Last Boy Scout   (1991), Last Action Hero (1993), and The Long Kiss Goodnight  (1996). Then the last two flopped, and Black disappeared into his moneyresurfacing last May at Cannes  with his first, modestly priced directorial job.
That proved to be a smart moveKiss Kiss , Bang Bang 's attitude 'n' adrenaline cocktail has been a festival favorite. I saw the movie in Toronto at a screening graced by Black's producer Joel Silver , resplendent in a formidable fuchsia suit (and matching sneakers), with an audience so primed for the spectacle, the hall resounded with excited applause even before the Warner Bros.  logo flashed on the screen.
Rehab is the name of the game. Robert Downey Jr. , no less, stars as an actor turned sneak thief. Scampering away from a bungled heist, he ducks into a handy movie audition andhey, hey, heyis soon transported from New York to Hollywood for a screen test. It is at some evil producer's pool party that Downey re-encounters his high school crush (Michelle Monaghan ), herself an aspiring actress as well as a pulp-obsessed girl of mysterysupplying the movie with both its love interest and, in the person of her missing sister, a necessary macguffin.
Pondering the dramatic personae, some may wonder if Downey's character wasn't left back 10 or 11 times so that he might meet his dream girl, but Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang  isn't designed to encourage rational thought. Tongue planted in its cheek and elbow digging for your ribs, the movie is tricked out with a panoply of new wave stuntsfunny flashbacks, humorous camera angles, distracting digressions, and a comic voice-over that more than once stops the action to critique itself. As the rhythmic title references Pauline Kael 's 1968 collection (that whirring sound is the critic rotating in her grave), and the chapter titles pointlessly reference Raymond Chandler , so the inside-baseball premise suggests a bloodier Get Shorty . (One might call the mode "Tarantino lite," were Lethal Weapon  not itself a contribution to the QT juggernaut.)
The sort of movie that believes coolness is next to godliness, Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang  trades heavily and successfully on Downey's unflappable likability. Val Kilmer  is not nearly as engaging as the hapless hero's sometime guru, a tough private eye cum acting coach nicknamed Gay Perry. (Get it, Frenchies?) Kilmer's sexual preferences provide a running gag that staggers on increasingly winded for most of the movie, as he, Downey, and Monaghan dodge all manner of comic boulders en route to the obligatory climactic car chase.
Essentially a pumped-up screwball comedy with a big body count and a soupçon of gross-out, Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang  clinches its status as a resurrection story by providing all the dead with a curtain callincluding Lincoln and Elvis . I can't say it made me laugh much, but then when a movie is so taken with its own jokes, it hardly needs an audience.
