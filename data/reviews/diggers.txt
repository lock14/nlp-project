By coincidence, two independent films about guys in their 30s and set on the eastern end of Long Island are opening at the Kendall today. One of them, "Sing Now or Forever Hold Your Peace " (see review on D8) is about singing yuppies in East Hampton. "Diggers," by contrast, is about burned-out clam diggers in Montauk . It's not only the better of the two, it's the funnier, in a bedraggled, clear-eyed way befitting men who know their livelihood is on life support.
Katherine Dieckmann's film takes place in late 1976 , as a corporate behemoth named South Shell is buying up water rights and restricting the local clammers to areas long played out. The four friends who are trying to keep the old ways going are Hunt (Paul Rudd ), who'd never admit he's a gifted photographer; ladies' man Jack (Ron Eldard ); stoner philosopher Cons (Josh Hamilton ); and Lozo (screenwriter Ken Marino ), who's married with five kids and another on the way.
"Diggers" isn't sentimental about these men or their way of life. Their greeting of choice is an upraised middle finger, and when Hunt's cantankerous father (Scott Sowers ) dies of heart failure out on the flats, Dieckmann films it obliquely, with a minimum of fuss. The old man is buried in his wedding suit and his waders, and he probably wouldn't have wanted it any other way.
The filmmakers have great fun with the trappings of the time period, from a diner waitress reading "The Hite Report " to Lozo's young son begging to see "Jaws " ("The shark gets blown up at the end," his father snaps . "There, you saw it . ") to the Jordache jeans on a chic young Manhattanite named Zoe (Lauren Ambrose of "Six Feet Under ") with whom Hunt silently flirts whenever he runs his boat past her parents' dock.
Also particular to this time and place is the smell of cannabis-infused fatalism. The characters get high to avoid thinking about the obvious -- everyone except Cons; pot just makes him more engaged -- but also because it's 1976 and they're on Long Island and they're bored. "Diggers" is acrid with all sorts of fumes: oil and bilge water, bog-funk and fish guts, the smoldering tinder of class resentment. Jimmy Carter's infamous "malaise" is right here, in these houses and on these boats, and the only way to deal with it is to laugh, smoke a joint, have sex, and not think about tomorrow.
That includes some of the women, but not all. After her father's death, Hunt's sister Gina (Maura Tierney ) is delighted to discover she no longer has to play the good daughter and randily sets her sights on one of the men. Lozo's wife (Sarah Paulson ), meanwhile, finds herself increasingly trapped by motherhood and her husband's fading career. "Diggers" has a good amount of desperate, foul-mouthed fun with this couple and their kids, and Marino's script doesn't sugar coat their predicament until he absolutely has to.
But he has to, just as Hunt's artistic ambitions and his romance with Zoe have to come to some kind of closure. The movie is strong and holding as long as it's shambling about in the Montauk dusk; when Dieckmann has to bring things to a resolution, "Diggers" turns ordinary -- sweet, but you've seen it many times before. Until then it's a tragicomedy of entropy, a film that wonders what happens to men when they can't do the only thing they know how to.


         "Diggers" is one of those dialogue-heavy, character-driven films that always seem to attract good actors. Featuring Paul Rudd, Maura Tierney, Josh Hamilton and Ron Eldard, among others, it's a generally well-executed — if overly familiar — tale of a vanishing America, one where the hard-working middle class falls under the heel of a corporation that endangers its way of life.
 
 "Diggers," written with nostalgic earthiness by Ken Marino, who also costars in the ensemble drama directed by Katherine Dieckmann, is set on Long Island in 1976 and focuses on four friends who are commercial clam diggers, the last in a long line. As their livelihoods fade, they're forced to face the prospect of moving on, a future they are unwilling or unable to accept. Each man numbs himself in his own way, postponing the inevitable. A death at the film's beginning sets the characters in motion on their journey from the inertia and ennui that traps them in the dwindling profession and ties them to their small town.
 


         






   Hunt (Paul Rudd), burdened by cynicism and imagined obligations, takes black-and-white Polaroids of inanimate objects and probably should have left long ago. He's contrasted with Frankie (Marino), who has real responsibilities — a houseful of kids and a saintly wife (Sarah Paulson) — threatened by a drinking problem and a fierce temper.
 
 Cons (Hamilton), a philosophizing pot peddler, and Jack (Eldard), a ladies' man with forearms the size of anvils, complete the quartet but are mainly present to add color and participate in the inevitable cathartic brawl and compulsory symbolic act required for resolution in such dramas.
 
 The movie is shot through with 1970s detail, from the Carter-Ford presidential race playing out on a barroom TV and the subtle deterioration of the town, to the stirrings of feminism in the female characters.
 
 Hunt's sister, Gina (Tierney), who works in the local diner, finds freedom by reading "The Hite Report" and acting on it. Lauren Ambrose, as a Manhattanite on a break, has a flirtatious fling with Hunt but clearly controls the relationship.
 
 The cast — all recognizable from television — embrace the period and locale, sporting credible facial hair and attempting variable Long Island accents. The wordiness of the script makes the first half of the film feel like an adapted stage play, but the actors are engaging and they convey plausible camaraderie.
 
 Dieckmann balances the comforting, sometimes contentious rhythms of the group's interactions with the uneasy sense that they are losing both the battle and the war with change. She also contributed Hunt's stark photographs, which capture fragments of a disappearing civilization.
 
 Archetypal characters and somewhat formulaic plot notwithstanding, "Diggers" has the conviction to avoid tying things up with a bow and allows us the privilege to imagine where its denizens will go afterward.

 A character reads “The Hite Report.” A newspaper headline blares “Jimmy Carter Charts New Vision.” The Blues Image hit “Ride Captain Ride” sounds like a muffled foghorn in the humid air. This is the world of “Diggers,” a group portrait of four guys in their 30s who work as clam diggers trolling the waters off the South Shore of Long Island. Their livelihood is imperiled when big business moves in and buys up the rights to the most productive areas.  This minutely observed period piece, set in 1976, has the brave, mournful tone of a Bruce Springsteen song (“My Hometown,” say) set in Billy Joel territory. Directed by Katherine Dieckmann from a screenplay by Ken Marino, who plays one of the principal characters, the film makes you contemplate the passage of time. When was it exactly that the recent past slipped into the more distant past and began to seem so poignantly out of reach? When did everything change?  “Diggers” fulfills the promise shown by Ms. Dieckmann’s 2000 directorial debut, “A Good Baby,” a Southern gothic-flavored tale about an abandoned infant discovered in the woods of North Carolina. Meticulously assembled, “Diggers” shuttles among several major characters with an ease and grace that don’t waste a moment of screen time. But it doesn’t feel rushed.  It also demonstrates that a solid formula, no matter how frequently followed, can be refreshed if it is handled with affectionate care. From “I Vitelloni” to “Diner” to “The Groomsmen,” a group of aging boys clinging together as the scary future threatens their solidarity is a natural movie subject. And “Diggers” works that formula with such confidence and knowledge of its particular environment that you hardly notice the craft behind it.  If the four friends and the women in their lives make up a stereotypical cross-section of thirtysomethings, the seamless ensemble acting and the way the screenplay captures the deeper realities bared in offhanded conversation make the characters seem alive and spontaneous.  The center of the group, Hunt (Paul Rudd), is a discontented clam digger who arrives late for work one day and discovers that his father has died alone of heart failure in his rotten old tub of a boat. Guilt-stricken, Hunt is suddenly forced to face a future in which the business his family has carried on for generations may vanish. He’s also an amateur photographer with vague artistic aspirations, and he strikes up a silent flirtation with Zoey (Lauren Ambrose), a haughty young Manhattan woman visiting her uncle, when his boat drifts past while she is reading on the shore. Later they begin an affair, which Hunt takes much too seriously.  Cons (Josh Hamilton), the group’s spaced-out hippie and part-time drug dealer, is a motormouthed intellectual showoff; he spouts theories about this and that with the zeal of a brainy crank who isn’t quite as knowledgeable as he thinks he is. Jack (Ron Eldard), the hunky local Lothario, buzzes from woman to woman, including Hunt’s divorced older sister, Gina (Maura Tierney), of whom Hunt is fiercely overprotective.  The most fully realized and saddest of the four, Lozo (Mr. Marino), is a hothead who has fathered five children with his wife, Julie (Sarah Paulson). As he faces the crumbling of his livelihood with kids tugging at him day and night, you tremble for him. Will he snap?  These diggers’ lives are punctuated by small melodramas that force them to confront uncomfortable truths about their relationships, their work and the uncertain future. A quintessential American independent movie, “Diggers” isn’t going to change the history of cinema. But it has integrity. It feels like life.  “Diggers” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and some profanity.

Low-key, likeable ensembler "Diggers" is a quintessential Amerindie for better and worse -- basically "Diner" in wading boots, it feels very familiar in conceit and unadventurous in execution, but offers the undeniable pleasures of a well-observed, well-played modest seriocomedy. Tale of several 30-ish townies watching their ancestors' clam-digging livelihood fade away in the mid-1970s Hamptons won't be tearing up the box office anywhere. Still, recognizable cast faces and pleasant overall impact make this attractive fare for cable, DVD release and limited theatrical exposure.
Although not on the best of terms with his crusty pa, Hunt (Paul Rudd) is guilt-stricken when he arrives typically late for a day's work on the bay and discovers the old man has died alone of heart failure. Hunt and his buddies already have worries enough, with a corporate fishery aggressively buying up water rights and limiting the independent clammers' access to prime areas.
This hits particularly hard for Lozo (scenarist Ken Marino), who's perpetually at odds with wife Julie (Sarah Paulson) over strapped finances -- they've got a big brood o' kids to support, with another on the way. Cons (Josh Hamilton) supplements his income with dealing drugs -- though he consumes the lion's share of them -- while local Casanova Jack (Ron Eldard) irks Hunt by turning his attention to Hunt's divorced sis Gina (Maura Tierney). Protag himself finds summer romance with visiting Manhattan hipster Zoey (Lauren Ambrose).
Screenplay's shaggy loser humor and writ-small situations, channeled through very affable perfs, make for a satisfying watch -- though parking-lot fistfight between townies and corporate creeps feels both conventional and underwhelming as climactic device.
Environ of the Hamptons -- pre-influx of the garishly wealthy -- might have been more flavorfully captured in aesthetic terms, but pic still rings truer in capturing a time and place than helmer Katherine Diekmann's prior "A Good Baby," which eventually fell victim to an overly melodramatic script. Good use is made of vintage rock tracks; tech package is decent.

A death in the family forces Hunt (Paul Rudd ), a Long Island  clam digger, to face up to his becalmed existence in Katherine Dieckmanns terrific movie about a dying way of life. The Ford-Carter debates simmer quietly in the background, but Dieckmann doesnt snow us with 70s symbolism. This very particular movie has a lyrical feel for place, period, and the rhythms of a small-town community tryingand tragicomically failingto run in place while the world around it opens its arms to creeping corporatism. Rudd is sweet and funny; Ron Eldard  and Josh Hamilton  are great as the towns aimless stud muffin and philosophizing pothead respectively. But the movie belongs to Ken Marino , who is riotously funny as the family man whose anger-management problem at last finds a fitting target in the big businessmen who come to destroy his living. Marino also wrote the outstanding script, which traps the foul-mouthed vitality of working-class speech in a bottle and makes it sing. Diggers is not a film you watchits a movie you live in, and when times up you feel the same sense of loss as do these guys, who realize they have no choice but to move on.
