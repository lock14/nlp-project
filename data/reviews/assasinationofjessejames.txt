At two hours and 40 minutes, The Assassination of Jesse James
 may be the world�s first epic of misguided hero worship. The film begins when its titular coward, Robert Ford (Affleck), shows up at the camp of legendary outlaw Jesse James (Pitt), circa 1881, looking for a job. Like all the best oater crews, the James gang is populated by a colorful, oddball collection of characters: unshowered men with crooked teeth, eclectic vocabularies, and a coarse yet innocent preoccupation with the female anatomy. But even among such a motley band, it�s Ford who�s the most unnerving. Gaunt and diffident but with an enormous chip on his shoulder, he grew up savoring tales � some tall, some true � of James� life outside the law and, like any obsessed fan, came to view his own value in direct proportion to his proximity to the thing he worshipped. Unfortunately, he�s joining the band long after their salad days are over. Instead, he�s just in time for the �Macbeth days,� which are defined less by high adventure and bank robberies than James� creeping paranoia; like the Scottish king before him, he begins hunting down and polishing off members of his crew before they can engage in any treachery. Into such intrigue walks Ford, who practically oozes treachery and isn�t above lying, betraying, or murdering to stay in his hero�s good graces � even if it means lying to, betraying, and murdering his hero. Written and directed by Dominik (Chopper
), The Assassination of Jesse James
 grabs on to many of the classic tropes of the Western � the meandering passage of time, the imposing landscapes, the abiding loneliness, the casual violence � and sets about mapping their furthest edges. With a dark and subtle visual style, Dominik shows what kind of havoc wide-open space and the constant threat of unnatural death can wreak, both on one�s mind and one�s body. No one in the movie is entirely right in the head, least of all James, whose rapidly disintegrating sanity provides Pitt with his juiciest role since Snatch
, one he chomps in to with all the relish of a guy who�s been playing suave leading men for too long. Dominik�s concern isn�t with drama�s traditional peaks and valleys (if it were, he would have come up with a different title); he�s more interested in mapping the social galaxy that revolves around James, a galaxy of a thousand planets, each with a story and each a key to a tradition of heroic thievery that will soon be nothing but a corpse on a table and a legend in a two-bit dime-store novelette.

         Put in simplest terms, "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is a film whose reach exceeds its grasp. Hugely ambitious and not without moments of success, this indulgent 2 hour and 40 minute epic ends up as unwieldy as its elongated title. It's a movie in love with itself, and few things are more fatal than that.
 
 That long title comes courtesy of Ron Hansen's novel about the death of the celebrated 19th century desperado, already a character in some 30 films, a book that so captivated writer-director Andrew Dominik and star Brad Pitt that they seemingly would not rest until they brought it to the screen.
 


         






   In truth, that 1983 novel is a haunting work that adds beautiful writing and psychological acuity to the familiar dramatic dilemma of why fellow outlaw Ford (Casey Affleck in a much-talked-about performance) murdered a man he considered his friend. While historians and biographers saw the size of the reward -- the equivalent of perhaps a million dollars today -- as the key factor, Hansen envisioned a near-Shakespearean tragedy of jealousy, paranoia, thwarted ambition and hero worship curdling and turning sour.
 
 While some of that complexity has made it to the film, "The Assassination of Jesse James" turns out to be the latest in a long string of adaptations seduced by a book's literary qualities only to learn the hard lesson that seeing is not believing, that things that work on the page do not necessarily transfer to the screen.
 
 What transfers best is Pitt's intriguing performance as the outlaw king, which won him the best actor award at the Venice Film Festival. The casually charismatic aspect of Jesse James (described by novelist Hansen as someone who "ate all the air in your lungs and the thoughts right out of your mind") is second nature to Pitt, but there is also an air of unsettling mystery around James and, as the film progresses, expressions of darker things as well.
 
 But, despite getting first billing in the title, this film is much less Jesse James' story than it is Robert Ford's, and that is a problem. Not with Affleck's performance, which is precisely what the character calls for, but with the nature of the character.
 
 Ford turns out to be one of the most off-putting individuals you never want to meet, someone who immediately lives up to the way he introduces himself (in book and film) to Jesse's brother Frank: "Folks sometimes take me for a nincompoop on account of the shabby first impression I make." So shabby that Frank James (Sam Shepherd at his orneriest) speaks for the audience when he replies, "I don't know what it is about you, but the more you talk, the more you give me the willies."
 
 While a character like this -- someone who, all evidence to the contrary, fully believes he is "destined for great things" -- can perversely fascinate in a book, film is a different medium. Spending hour after hour watching this callow leech so worm his way into James' life that the outlaw himself says, "do you want to be like me, or do you want to be me," is close to torture.
 
 Even worse is the considerable time spent with the rivalries and contretemps of the fatuous misfits and lowlife losers that are the best James can do for a gang in these last days of his career. While the women in this film, notably Mary-Louise Parker as Jesse's wife, Zee, have almost nothing to say, writer-director Dominik can't get enough of the painfully authentic period dialogue of his boys. But with the exception of Frank James (who has the good sense to leave the film almost immediately), these feeble nonentities come off as a whiny 19th century version of the guys from "Entourage," or maybe the "Dumb and Dumber" version of "Mean Girls." With guns.
 
 Making all this more difficult to digest is the self-consciously artistic style that Australian filmmaker Dominik, who made his reputation with the super-kinetic action film "Chopper," has unexpectedly adopted. Though cinematographer Roger Deakins has produced some remarkable images, the directing style here is unrelievedly languid and overblown. Dominik likely had something like Robert Altman's "McCabe and Mrs. Miller" in mind, but what he has achieved is closer to the unfairly denigrated but still disappointing "Heaven's Gate."
 
 Perhaps the most frustrating thing about "The Assassination of Jesse James," however, is that a shift in narrative direction late in the second half stops you from writing off the film completely. A more terrifying, coldblooded and psychotic side to James emerges, and, partially as a reaction to that, Ford's character changes as well, and that combination creates a more  focused dynamic.
 
 Partisans will argue that without the leisurely tedium of "Assassination's" first two hours this involvement would not have happened, but that is the voice of excess speaking. As it is, the film's ending serves less as a triumphant capstone than a melancholy taste of what might have been if drama had not taken a back seat to artifice and indulgence.

The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford   a haunting retelling of one of the enduring outlaw sagas in American culture  is shot by the brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins in a wide-open geography of moody skies and fields plaintive with bent light and shadow. Yet the psychological heart of the matter is dark, secretive, and daringly interior. This masterful Western by New Zealand filmmaker Andrew Dominik (Chopper ), based on the 1983 book by Ron Hansen, dips into the genre-bending influences of wild-card Westerns from the late '60s and '70s like Bonnie and Clyde  and Days of Heaven  for its elegiacally fatalistic tone. Yet the picture emerges with something very much plaguing the 21st century on its mind  a cool acceptance of lethal paranoia as the natural state brought on by the weight of too much legend building and the warp of too much unrequited  fandom. The charismatic, bank-robbing, gunslinging James, after all, was shot in the back by a puny would-be tagalong who claimed to be the gang leader's biggest fan, and this is one rueful recounting of how it all went down. Stories about the loneliness of celebrity and the dangers of firearms rarely get starker or more mesmerizing than that.
Brad Pitt plays James with a tired-eyed, authoritative understanding of fame's traps (he won the acting prize at the Venice Film Festival for his work), and a revelatory Casey Affleck brings Ford to life with a mature sense of an underling's craven, fawning petulance. But so true to its own lights is Dominik's artful creation that all the actors (the sterling cast includes a fine Sam Rockwell as Ford's brother, Sam Shepard as Jesse's older brother, and Mary-Louise Parker as Jesse's wife) fit effortlessly into the larger narrative landscape, none too big for their britches. The nervy style of this newfangled Western, with its eerie, insinuating score by Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, is so effective that long after Pitt and Affleck have left the screen, emotional disturbance lingers like gun smoke.

 Before a bullet shattered his skull in 1882, Jesse James cut a bloody swath through parts of the Midwest and the South, leaving a trail of corpses and favorable press notices in his wake. Bad man, poor man, bushwhacker, thief, James was as American as apple pie and the Confederate flag he wrapped himself in like an excuse. That bard of the great unwashed, Woody Guthrie, compared him to Robin Hood, and decades later Bruce Springsteen kept the fires burning, singing about a homespun legend  as seductive as it is false.  The lachrymose new film “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” adds another gauzy chapter to the overtaxed James myth, if not much rhyme or reason, heart or soul. Topped by Brad Pitt wearing boot-black hair and a faraway stare, this is a portrait of the murderer as a middle-aged man as seen through the curious mirror of celebrity. At a well-seasoned 34, James lives in an ordinary house in an ordinary town, where he sits in his backyard smoking cigars and handling snakes, a devil playing at preacher. His days with Confederacy guerrillas are long gone, as are most of his crimes. Among his closest companions now is his greatest fan, Bob Ford, a gunslinger slyly played by Casey Affleck.  As its title announces, “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” is about a murder, the last violent chapter in a cruelly violent life. As such, it’s also about a celebrity stalker, a kind of Mark David Chapman in spurs who nurses an annihilating love for the object of his obsession. It’s an obsession fueled and fanned by the media, including the sympathetic newsmen who saw James as a heroic anti-Reconstructionist, and the fiction writers who memorialized and even exalted the brutal exploits of his gang. Like a schoolgirl with a crush, Bob Ford keeps his treasured Jesse James dime novels in a box under his bed. When he caresses the cover of one book,  it’s as if he were tenderly stroking a lover’s cheek.  If there was  more to Bob’s love, you won’t find it here, despite a coy bathtub scene that finds James luxuriating in milky water while the younger man hovers uncertainly nearby. “You want to be like me or do you want to be me?” asks James, casting his glance back at the man others would later brand Judas. In this nearly all-male world of camaraderie and gunsmoke, where little women bustle discreetly in the background (including Mary-Louise Parker as James’s wife, Zee), the ways of the flesh, of heaving, stinking, struggling humanity, have little place. For all their exploded bone and ravaged pulp, their trickles and rivulets of blood, the men in this film aren’t as much bodies as beautiful, empty signifiers.  In his last — and first — feature film, “Chopper” (2000), the New Zealand-born director Andrew Dominik seemed on the same wavelength as his raucous, at times queasy, entertaining subject, the ultrabrutal criminal reprobate of the title, played by Eric Bana. Neither overtly sympathetic nor disapproving, the filmmaker presented his villain as a larger-than-life but unequivocally human grotesque. Using color like an Expressionist, he bleached the screen a sizzling white that turned  blood red nearly black and splashed on hues of bilious green and urine yellow as if to suggest that Chopper’s fluids had leaked from his body to contaminate his surroundings. The colors sicken and beguile, as does the human riddle at their center.  There’s a different riddle in “The Assassination of Jesse James,” staring into a florid sunset,  slashes of red cutting across the sky. Dressed in near-all black, the question mark known as Jesse James stands away from the camera, knee-deep in a golden,  grassy field stirred by the wind or perhaps just an off-screen mechanical fan.  It’s a striking, pleasing image, whatever the case, pretty as a picture postcard, a vision of man and nature that brings to mind Thoreau at Walden Pond or more precisely Terrence Malick’s “Days of Heaven.” James is also facing West, of course, toward the last frontier, home to cowboys and Indians and prospectors of all types, including, soon enough, those who will wield movie cameras, not six-shooters.  If he had lived, James might have saddled up for the movies,   and, indeed, his own son played him in the 1921 film “Jesse James Under the Black Flag.” When “The Assassination” opens in September 1881, shortly before his final train robbery and seven months before his death, James was already a star of sorts, a living if fast-aging legend, a favorite newspaper subject, a government target and the featured attraction in hundreds of dime novels with titles like “The James Boys and the Vigilantes.”  Mr. Pitt is himself a supernova luminary, of course, and part of the attraction of this film is how his celebrity feeds into that of his character, adding shadings to what is, finally, an overconceptualized if under-intellectualized endeavor.  It’s a curious performance, at once central and indistinct, but then, so too is the character. Based on the novel of the same title by Ron Hansen, the film introduces James at the beginning of his end. Hunkered down in some woods, surrounded by darkly dressed men and leafless birch trees, and framed by Roger Deakins’s impeccable, stark, high-contrast cinematography, he looks a vision. This isn’t just Jesse James — it’s also Jim Morrison at the Whisky in 1966 with a dash of Laurence Olivier, a touch of Warren Beatty and more than a hint of Ralph Lauren. It’s the beautiful bad man, knowing and doomed, awaiting his fate like some Greco-Hollywood hero, rather than the psychotic racist of historical record.  The movies have their truths, which  rarely align with those of history. Taken on its own narrow, heavily aestheticized and poetic-realist terms, then, “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” works. The cinematography may speak to Mr. Dominik’s yearning for meaning and importance more than it does of his outlaw, but the visuals often dazzle and enthrall. (The images that approximate the blurred distortions characteristic of pinhole photography are especially striking.) They also distract and, after a while, help weigh down the film, which sinks under the heaviness of images so painstakingly art directed, so fetishistically lighted and adorned, that there isn’t a drop of life left in them. Instead of daguerreotype, Mr. Dominik works in stone.  The question of whether the world or cinema needs another monument to an American gangster, a thug who lived by the gun and repeatedly killed in cold blood, remains unanswered by the film and its makers. And perhaps that isn’t a question worth asking. This is, after all, meant to be an evening’s entertainment,  and its burdens should remain modest even if its goals are not. Its revelations, aside from Mr. Affleck’s performance, which manages to make the character seem dumb and the actor wily and smart, are nonexistent. The true story of Jesse James, despite all the dime novels and B movies, remains untold, perhaps because in its savagery it really is as American as apple pie and, as such, unspeakably hard to tell.  “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gun violence, rude language.

The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford

  By 
TODD MCCARTHY

    
 
 
 
A ravishing, magisterial, poetic epic that moves its characters toward their tragic destinies with all the implacability of a Greek drama, "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford" is one of the best Westerns of the 1970s, which represents the highest possible praise. It's a magnificent throwback to a time when filmmakers found all sorts of ways to refashion Hollywood's oldest and most durable genre. Given the narrower current notion of what constitutes an acceptable commercial feature, Andrew Dominik's daring high-wire act will trod a very hard road to find secure theatrical footing, which suggests Warner Bros. might do best to nurture it in a small number of theaters in the hope that critical support and word of mouth will snowball into long runs and a slow rollout.
Whether it directly resembles them or not, this impeccable new picture is at one with the adventurous spirit that produced such films as "McCabe & Mrs. Miller," "Pat Garrett & Billy the Kid," "Bad Company," "The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid," "Jeremiah Johnson," "The Outlaw Josey Wales," "Days of Heaven," "The Long Riders" and, yes, "Heaven's Gate," rather than with anything being made today.
Shot two years ago and long delayed in editing, pic marks an enormous advance for Dominik beyond his 2000 Aussie prison crimer "Chopper." Elegant, artful and consumed by a fascination with American history and Western lore, his adaptation of Ron Hansen's popular 1983 novel retills the once overworked ground of outlaw legend so thoroughly that it has become fertile once again. Pic's hefty 160-minute running time will no doubt cause carping in some quarters, but this is one film whose length seems absolutely right for what it's doing.
Meticulously noting dates and locations, and framing the story's long arc with discreetly distanced narration, yarn commences on Sept. 5, 1881, just prior to the last train robbery pulled off by the James gang in their 14-year career . After this spectacularly staged nocturnal job, the older surviving brother, Frank (Sam Shepard), calls it quits and disappears back East, leaving Jesse (Brad Pitt), who's 34, to continue with the help of dubious lowlifes such as the Ford boys.
Most questionable member of the latter clan is 19-year-old Robert (Casey Affleck), whose wimpy demeanor, thin, unemphatic voice and irritatingly sycophantic manner mark him as a singularly unpromising gunslinger.
But even when Jesse returns to his life with wife and children under the alias of Thomas Howard, he can't quite bring himself to get rid of Bob, a leech who has collected every dime novel written about his hero. Jesse is both appalled and amused , at one point taunting Bob with the question, "You want to be like me, or you want to be me?"
Although arrestingly different from the outset, pic initially feels over-elaborated; shots in which the edges are purposely blurred, and a soundtrack too conspicuously mixed to emphasize ambient sounds of insects and weather, warn of incipient pretension. Fears also gather that Dominik has no intention of supplying the film with enough dramatic traction to sustain interest over the long haul, as the deliberate pacing seems designed to accommodate numerous embellishments and digressions.
But any sense of viewer impatience is soon overtaken by the film's accumulation of detail on every front -- narrative, historical, folkloric, behavioral and psychological. Pitching the dialogue in a way that neatly injects prairie twang with a literary lyricism, Dominik settles into an expansive narrative strategy of the sort often found in novels and longform series, wherein the story skips and meanders among events whose relevance and meaning may be initially unclear, but which are all there for good reasons.
While Jesse cools his heels and smokes his big cigars at home, attention shifts to cohorts Charley Ford (Sam Rockwell), Bob's grinning older brother; Jesse's cousin, the homely Wood Hite (Jeremy Renner), and Dick Liddil (Paul Schneider), a self-styled ladies' man . Jesse's shadow hovers over them all, and narrative's dominant ploy is that the other characters are constantly afraid that Jesse, no matter where he is, will find out about any transgressions on their part and will come after them.
Which, in fact, he does. Intensely aware of his legendary status and willing to play it up when it suits him, especially with the worshipful Bob, this Jesse James is both paranoid that everyone's out to get himand resigned to the fact that his days are numbered. His antennae for sensing when something is amiss are almost supernaturally acute, and he takes more than one long journey to track down people plotting against him . The irony is that the man he really needs to have his eye on is the one closest to him.
Eventually, the long-ineffectual authorities get into the act, setting in place the mechanism leading to Bob Ford's almost ritual killing of Jesse as he dusts a picture frame in his house. But that's not all, as the final half-hour provides its own fascination in playing out the strange fate of the man whose fame came with its own curse.
At least as conceived here, Jesse James is the biggest celebrity in the land, and Pitt generously endows the character with the droit de signeur 
he switches on at will. Thesp emphasizes Jesse's mercurial nature, but in a way that suggests much of it is calculated, a strategy that, until the end, he uses to manipulate events . It's a layered, continually interesting performance.
Affleck makes an indelible impression as the insecure, physically unprepossessing weakling who endures no end of humiliation, and eventually embodies the sort of nobody who has bloodied American history from time to time to insure his own immortality.
Rockwell's effectively drawn Charley Ford is weak, but in a different way than his brother, always ducking to stay out of trouble, and he's a good foil for the other, more withdrawn rural men. Supporting turns are vivid all around, including a vibrant cameo by political strategist James Carville as a big-shot governor.
Even those who resist the film itself will be in awe of its surpassing visual beauty and consummate craftsmanship. Just when it seemed that cinematographer Roger Deakins had achieved another career high with "No Country for Old Men," he trumps himself yet again, here using a subdued palette of parched-plains earth tones captured with an extraordinary luminosity and delicacy.
Made on various Canadian locations, pic boasts great production values from top to bottom.

Calling all pundits. It's a baffling caprice of the zeitgeist to have two studio westerns released in the same month, 30-odd years after the genre basically gave up the ghost. James Mangold 's better-than-competent and highly crowd-pleasing 3:10 to Yuma   has provided a harmonica fanfare for something more ambitious and polarizing. Written and directed by 40-year-old, New Zealand born Andrew Dominik , The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford  is a deeply, unsentimentally nostalgic moviebut nostalgic for what exactly?
Premiered last month at the Venice Film Festival, The Assassination of Jesse James   was hailed by Variety  as a magnificent anachronism, "one of the best Westerns of the 1970s." But unlike, for example, the echt 1972 Great Northfield Minnesota Raid , a soggy, autumnal affair in which the James brothers appear in the guise of tattered, mystical quasi-hippies, Dominik's film isn't revisionist nor, as with Mangold, is Dominik's desire revivalist. Gritty but mythic, a dirty western with clean shirts, oblique in some ways and obvious in others, Jesse James  is a bold, even wacky, reinvention. This is a psychological chamber drama in which the wide-open spaces are geographic as well as mental.
Unfolding mainly in the aftermath of the James Gang 's last hold-up, the movie specifically concerns the paranoid relationship between charismatic Jesse (Brad Pitt ) and Bob Ford  (Casey Affleck ), the Judas who will murder him. They meet at a woodland conclave where the gang is planning its final train robbery. This creepy, strangely smiling, young kiss-up gives Jesse's brother Frank (Sam Shepard ) the willies. But if Ford is star-struck, so is the movie. The gang is shown laboriously blocking railroad tracks with debris so that Jesse can less-than-realistically leap atop the barricade to face down the locomotive himself. A star must have admirers. "You want to be like me or you want to be me?" Jesse asks Bob, fixing him with his clear, and clearly insane, gaze. (The question jumps out of the narrative: Pitt may have won the Best Actor award at Venice, but the movie belongs to awkward, whiny Affleck.)
Jesse James  runs a leisurely two and a half hours. For what seems like half of it, members of the James Gang, who include Bob's get-along brother Charlie (Sam Rockwell ), lay low in a desolate farmhouse somewhere beyond the Ozarks. Speculation on their moody leader's doings aside, the main source of entertainment is teasing the creepy little guy with the odd smile and treasured shoebox of Jesse James dime novels. Eventually, the gang disperses and, increasingly nutty, Jesse begins dropping in on his old associates' lairs, trying to ascertain whether they're likely to betray him. The suspicious outlaw is a psyche-out artist as well as a psycho.
Meanwhile, Bob develops his own delusions of grandeur, planning to liberate himself from the tyranny of his erstwhile idol and demanding an audience with the governor (no less than James Carville ). Unlike Sam Fuller 's 1949 I Shot Jesse James , a low-budget western noir in which Ford is portrayed as a stubbornly single-minded, insolent fool, Jesse James  presents the assassin as an aggrieved fan boy: "I've been a nobody all my life . . . and Jesse James has been as big as a tree." Inexplicably tolerant of Bob, Jesse seems to invite martyrdom; he presents him with a new six-shooter, and later his back. The actual shooting occurs on Palm Sunday; it's marked by signs and portents and has a ritual, preordained quality. Afterward, the narrator notes, "a thousand people would make the spellbound pilgrimage to the cottage" where Jesse breathed his last.
The relationship between crime and celebrity clearly interests Dominik; his only other feature, the 2000 Chopper , was a visually strident and powerfully absurdist portrait of an Australian career criminalthe self-dramatizing author of nine autobiographical bestsellers, one titled How to Shoot Friends and Influence People . That's more or less an ironic description of Bob Ford's fate. A year after shooting Jesse, he's re-enacting the deed on a New York stage, condemned to relive his crime until, inevitably, he's dispatched by another irate nobody.
Jesse James  was shot largely in midwestern Canada, but there's something suggestively Australian about the way the movie dramatizes empty space and loneliness. Full of slow dollies and haunted close-ups, this is a film of Rembrandt  lighting and Tarkovsky weather. The sun pours down like honey and Vaseline  limns the lens. The skies shimmer with onrushing clouds; the fields dance with waving brown weeds, for which Nick Cave  and Warren Ellis  have provided a suitably spacey score.
Although not as radically defamiliarizing as Jim Jarmusch 's avant-western Dead Man , Jesse James  has the feel of an attic ransacked for abandoned knickknacks. There are intimations of what Greil Marcus  called the "old weird America"a sneaking sense that Dominik might have preferred to shoot the whole thing through a pinhole camera or fashion his story out of musty daguerreotypes. But then, as demanding as the movie is, maybe it's just old-fashioned crazy.
