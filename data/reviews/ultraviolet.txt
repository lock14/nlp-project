Violet, the central character in "Ultraviolet," is almost
 as versatile as the actress who portrays her, ubiquitous pop culture chameleon Milla Jovovich. Violet is a sword-fighting, high-kicking, gun-sprouting mutant soldier; Jovovich, meanwhile, has been a folk-pop singer, beauty product hawker, and red-carpet fashionista. With the "Resident Evil" films already to her credit, she can now unequivocally add action-flick superheroine to her resume.
With Kurt Wimmer's movie, Jovovich joins Kate Beckinsale, Charlize Theron, Halle Berry, Jennifer Garner, and Uma Thurman as the latest star to don a really tight leather catsuit and sensible high-heeled boots with which to kick the bad guys' faces in. And to avoid the nasty chapped lips that can come with racing one's motorcycle up the side of a skyscraper to elude the helicopters (more bad guys) after her, Violet/Milla wears a good amount of lip gloss.
Jovovich is bad, and not in a good way. She turns in an epically expressionless performance (maybe she thought it was one of her modeling gigs?) but she sure looks great deadpanning lines like, "You're all gonna die," and "Come and get it." Still, you'd expect more bright, pulpy life, if not believability, out of a comic-book character.
But this retread is certainly not all Jovovich's fault. Also to blame are the shopworn story, written and directed by Wimmer (writer-director of 2002's "Equilibrium"), predictable special effects -- lots of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"-meets-"The Matrix" fight scenes -- generic techno-bombast soundtrack, and an airbrushed '80s "Heavy Metal" comics look that veers from soft-focus "Miami Vice" pastels to hypersaturated anime coloring.
The plot involves the ostracized, ghetto-ized vampire-virus-mutated "Hemophages" (of which Violet is one) who, living in a 21st-century world governed by fear of disease, decide to strike back at those who would stamp them out. Violet is their only hope for stealing a superweapon from the evil Daxus (the familiar, villain-faced Nick Chinlund, honing his chops for a future Bond role), who's so coldly lethal that he can kill five soldiers while not spilling a drop from a cup of coffee.
Turns out that when Violet opens the case housing the weapon, which resembles a white toilet seat, inside is a 9-year-old boy submerged in sparkling water -- a dying clone, we later learn, who goes by the name Six (a very doleful Cameron Bright). Having been forced by the Daxus crew to terminate her own pregnancy years before, and not sure whether the lab-rat Six is the secret to the Hemophages' salvation or destruction, she feels compelled to protect him against would-be assailants.
There is the requisite climactic duel in the dark with Daxus, which gives Violet a chance to turn her weapon into a sword of fire; plus lots of stomped solar plexuses en route, and ultimately, a message of fragile hope for all.
Reportedly, the source of Wimmer's inspiration for the can-do woman defending the helpless kid from the baddies was John Cassavetes's 1980 film, "Gloria." But Jovovich is no Gena Rowlands, and, judging by the laughably inane, stilted dialogue of "Ultraviolet" ("Are you mental?" Daxus queries Violet as she's about to take on a 700-soldier army), Wimmer ain't no Cassavetes.

"Ultraviolet" is the CG movie-as-computer game, with a difference. While the best games demand replay, sci-fi/chopsocky specialist Kurt Wimmer's latest isn't likely to lure repeaters, except perhaps lonely young guys communing with an athletically trim Milla Jovovich on their bedroom tubes when this goes to vid, which will doubtless be soon.
Those who feel Sidney Lumet's remake of "Gloria" was the worst possible retelling of John Cassavetes' unusual action meller may reconsider in light of "Ultraviolet," which, pressbook informs, Wimmer spun from a personal love of the film.
Jovovich's vengeful Violet is a gal on a rampage who takes an innocent boy under her wing, but any resemblance to "Gloria" stops there. Pic is hermetically sealed in a synthetic wrapping that's so total -- Sony's top-flight high-def cameras, visibly low-budget CG work, exceptionally hackneyed and imitative action and dialogue --that it arrives a nearly lifeless film.
After a zippy comic book-inspired title sequence that graphically mimics the dazzling intro of "Hulk," Violet warns auds -- all too accurately -- that she was "born into a world you may not understand." Infected with a blood virus first developed to build super soldiers, she is part of an underground group with enhanced physical powers.
Her nemesis is Vice Cardinal Daxus (Nick Chinlund), whose complete command of the hyper-high tech city where the action is set begs the unanswered question: Who can the Cardinal be?
Violet is ordered by underground leader Nerva (Sebastien Andrieu, slumming after Agnes Jaoui's "Look at Me") to retrieve an encased weapon. After mowing down an army of soldiers in her way, Violet discovers that the weapon is actually a child with special attributes named Six (Cameron Bright, far less spooky here than he was in "Birth").
Seeing that everyone is out to get Six -- whose blood may contain a cure to what ails Violet and her ilk -- she protects him while suffering from her own bouts of illness, with some help along the way from doc friend Garth (a wasted William Fichtner).
Inanely grim, pic could have easily been a delicious genre spoof if made by a different writer-director. Wimmer's filmmaking exudes geeky literalism and the absorption of many better chopsocky pics, but offers nothing new. Fight scenes, choreographed by Mike Smith, are repetitious, using the same ideas and moves over and over, while gunplay is "Matrix"-lite.
Jovovich builds her perf out of a series of poses, while real thesping is handled by ace character actor Chinlund.
Tech work is low quality, particularly in effects-heavy sequences that look like rough drafts rather than the finished product. Shanghai locales have inspired clean lensing by Hong Kong vet Arthur Wong Ngok Tai. Klaus Badelt's score hammers aud ears into submission.

Seems this is yet another puddle of futuristic sludge for us to blame on John Cassavetes , whose Gloria  (1980) reportedly inspired writer-director Kurt Wimmer  (Equilibrium ) to replace Gena Rowlands  with Milla Jovovich  and the original heroine's ordinary pistol with a Tec-9/knife combo that looks like an industrial-strength stapler. Another striking modification: Wimmer's late-21st-century Gloria is, in her words, "something less than human"Â—a diseased vampire, in fact, who carries a real boy in her nth-generation iBook  even though there's a Blood War being waged between humans and her kind in what's left of Shanghai . Because the movie's smeared pastel images strongly suggest an untweaked blowup from the Xbox , it's never clear whether the rail-thin Jovovich actually performed in the film or just consented to full-body digitization. And though terms such as "dimension-compressing" and "vampiral antigens" are ostensibly meant to clarify things, the most receptive audience will mainly be enlightened to know that you can make a movie as thoroughly unprofessional as this one and still get it released in 3,000 theaters.
