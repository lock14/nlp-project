From the beginning of time, or at least the roots of rock & roll, outcast teens have found comfort and companionship in music where none is to be had in their peer circles. Bandslam
 takes that idea and literalizes it: The first lines of the film are, �Dear David Bowie,� in one of many e-mails 15-year-old Will Burton (Connell) will write to his rock god. Will is a loner and, in the eyes of his classmates, a loser, which is why his sympathetic single mom (Kudrow) moves them at the film�s beginning from unforgiving Cleveland to a fresh start in New Jersey. At his new school, Will is still Will � a shy, music-obsessed kid unversed in social strategizing ��but he is quickly latched onto by two very different girls: a blond-tressed former cheerleader named Charlotte (Michalka), who has burned all bridges with the A-list crowd, and Sa5m (Hudgens), a dry wit smirking her way through the high school horrordrome. (�The five is silent,� Sa5m deadpans, low and slow due to a childhood stutter.) Both girls pack some powerful pipes, which will come in handy for a citywide battle of the bands called Bandslam, the anticipation of which drives the film (which was shot in Central Texas and features local bands). Will becomes a sort of benign Svengali, putting together the hiply titled band I Can�t Go On I�ll Go On ��an apt summation of any misunderstood high schooler�s survival mantra ��while also fumbling toward a romantic relationship with Sa5m. Will courts her in his own way, which includes a blissful interlude where the two break into the seminal, now-shuttered Bowery club CBGB. It�s�a setting that would seem to hold more sentimental freight for the adult filmmaker, Graff, and his co-writer Josh A. Cagan, but then one remembers that in the age of the Internet, any teen can be not only savvy but a specialist in crumbling monuments to rock. Bandslam
 plays like a spiritual companion to last year�s Nick and Norah�s Infinite Playlist
 � goofier, flabbier, and less artful, but possessing the same joie de vivre of youth reveling in rock. Bandslam
 is also considerably tamer when it comes to its teen romancers; a couple of chaste pecks won�t turn off the preteen fans of Disney-anointed Hudgens and Michalka (or their parents). Both are fine ��Hudgens, especially, shows spark in the more interesting role � but they�re top-billed in name alone: Bandslam
 belongs to Connell. He has the unruly 'fro and endearing shamblingness of a young Daniel Stern, and he ably brings to life that rarest of cinematic qualities: decency. In the climactic battle of the bands, Will faces every adolescent�s worst nightmare � an auditorium packed with chanting prats, unified in mockery of him � and through his own cunning and good-heartedness turns it into a moment of triumph. It�s an elating moment, and an uncommon one: Will�s triumph doesn�t come from taking down his classmates but by bringing them up to his own level,�and it�s perfectly in tune with this special little film�s own commitment to � again, that unsexy but most fundamental quality � decency.

Imagine the shock of “High School Musical’’ fans, Disney Channel addicts, their parents, and their deeply unwilling older siblings who sit down for “Bandslam’’ and are confronted with . . . a good movie. Not an original movie, but a good one: pleasurable, smart, aware that pop music has a history that goes back further than Britney Spears’s first CD. Summit Entertainment executives, in their attempt to colonize what little remains of your children’s mindshare, have done the unthinkable. They have handed one of their movies to an intelligent writer-director and allowed him to breathe life into it.

That writer-director is Todd Graff, a former actor who made the wonderful, if ragged, 2003 musical theater summer camp movie “Camp.’’ “Bandslam’’ is “Camp’’ with rock ’n’ roll instead of show tunes, but its roots go back to the Busby Berkeley backstagers and Mickey-and-Judy let’s-put-on-a-show musicals of the 1930s. It helps immeasurably that the script is informed with a deep-dish appreciation of rock lore along the lines of “School of Rock.’’ When two of the teenage characters argue whether the Velvet Underground was better before or after Lou Reed kicked John Cale out of the band, you know this movie’s doing something right. (Maybe not believably so, but who cares?)

Gaelan Connell, a ringer for the young Daniel Stern, plays Will Burton, a lanky high schooler relocated from Cincinnati to New Jersey as the movie begins. He’s a self-conscious misfit with a brightly brittle single mom, Karen (Lisa Kudrow), and an encyclopedic knowledge of pop history. As such, he’s scooped up by Charlotte (Aly Michalka), a distressed former cheerleader aching to prove her singing chops in the upcoming multi-school Bandslam competition. Charlotte’s a user but a harmless one, and both she and Will are toting dark secrets that will get aired before the final credits roll. (Don’t worry, Mom; they’re PG secrets.)

Will becomes the band’s coolly capable manager, talking the lead guitarist (Charlie Saxton) down from his Flea worship, adding a horn section, a keyboardist, and an amusingly antisocial drummer (Ryan Donowho) with a Stacy’s-mom crush on Karen. He gives them a new name: I Can’t Go On, I’ll Go On (any relation to “Waiting for Godot’’ coincidental and unattributed). So obsessed does Will become that he neglects his class partner, the pining Goth-lite girl Sa5m (the 5 is silent; ah, high school). As for his studies, no one ever does homework in movies like this.

Sa5m is played by Vanessa Hudgens - yes, Princess Sparkle of the “HSM’’ franchise has gone over to the dark side. Sort of. Hudgens is likable as this diluted version of Ally Sheedy in “The Breakfast Club,’’ and you can tell she relishes not being the center of attention, but it’s only a matter of time before Sa5m ascends to her proper place in the movie’s scheme. Hudgens is, verily, the Ruby Keeler of her generation, which means she’s going to go out there and become a star whether it makes sense or not.
For all its formulaic touches - I Can’t Go On, I’ll Go On has to go up against a group led by Charlotte’s former boyfriend (Scott Porter), a preening rock-jock - “Bandslam’’ wins you over. The characters wield their cynicism only to paper over their adolescent insecurities; underneath they’re earnest without being saps. Within the context of modern family comedies and the vast enabling wasteland of tweener TV, these people feel almost three-dimensional.

And the music is the real deal, for the most part. A few sludgy teen power ballads have snuck in, because, I guess, Hudgens and Michalka (of the teen-pop sister act Aly and AJ) have to sell the soundtrack CD. But “Bandslam’’ is narrated in the form of Will’s regular e-mails to his idol David Bowie (e-mails that go unanswered until - I can say no more), and the movie’s awareness of rock’s family tree is democratic enough to embrace Wilco, Cheap Trick, Peter Bjorn & John, and an only mildly ridiculous ska version of Bread’s “Everything I Own.’’ All that’s missing, in retrospect, is hip-hop, R&B, soul, or any other form of genuine Afro-Am pop. If the movie isn’t the usual white bread, neither is it more than a loaf of processed whole wheat.

Still, will the little girls understand? Mine did. (I know, I keep dragging my daughters into these reviews, but, trust me, this time it’s relevant.) The older couldn’t be bothered; the younger came to the screening expecting to scoff. Her tastes are bracketed by her dad’s love of all things post-punk and her peers’ addiction to KISS 108, which, as it turns out, is pretty much the sweet spot mined by “Bandslam.’’ She and the other kids in the theater came out glowing, their inner playlists both confirmed and unexpectedly broadened. Forget the tie-in CD; the first thing my daughter did was go home and burn her own. That’s a tiny empowerment, but it counts.




Correction: 
 Because of a reporting error, this review of the movie "Bandslam" in the "g" section incorrectly identified the film's studio. "Bandslam" is a Summit Entertainment film.



It's a familiar song: Misfit teens in the process   of forming a high school band learn life lessons and raise their goblets of rock. But there's enough of a strong filmmaking backbeat in Bandslam  to carry the movie's light tune. Vanessa Hudgens expands her repertory by playing a sarcastic loner rather than the brainy popular girl she's made famous in High School Musical . As a rebellious former cheerleader,  Aly Michalka perfects the power of hair tossing. And as the movie's sweet, geeky hero, newcomer Gaelan Connell excels  in wry conversations with the always-welcome  Lisa Kudrow, who plays his loving mother.


 “Bandslam” may not entirely break new teen-movie ground, but it does offer intriguing glimpses of performers ready to bolt from the Disney stable, namely Vanessa Hudgens of the “High School Musical” films and Aly Michalka of the Disney Channel series “Phil of the Future.” Of course neither star is R-rated-ready (Ms. Hudgens’s well-publicized misadventures with cellphone photos notwithstanding), but “Bandslam” nudges them away from factory fodder.  A newcomer, Gaelan Connell (with Michael Cera’s nerdiness but less wan sensitivity), is Will, an alienated student who moves to Lodi, N.J., with his mom (Lisa Kudrow, perfectly straddling drama and humor, while evincing charming if familiar Kudrowisms). Will becomes the manager for the motley band of the ex-cheerleader Charlotte (Ms. Michalka).  Charlotte’s group is challenging her previous one, led by her smug ex, Ben (Scott Porter), the favored contender at the annual interschool battle of the bands. Will also meets the broody, bookish Sa5m (the 5, you see, is silent), played unconvincingly by Ms. Hudgens.  Ms. Michalka exudes a robust assurance befitting her musical experience. (As half of the sister duo Aly and A J, she has recorded two appealing albums.)  Ms. Hudgens has a reggae-tinged number refreshingly distant from the arid club lite of her own record. Tidy, heartfelt direction by Todd Graff (“Camp”); astute song references; and a David Bowie cameo transcend the formula underpinnings and keep “Bandslam” buoyant, gratifying and, yes, rocking.  “Bandslam” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It includes cellphones, text messages, loud instruments, parental anxiety and a tasteful lesson in how to kiss.

High school musicals have their scrappiest number in "Bandslam," an awkward, earnest, almost irresistible indie whose pair of distaff Disney Channel alums -- both belting out soundtrack pop -- give it a decent shot in the battle for tween B.O. Those 15 and up will hear off-key notes in the ballad of Will, a young, music-loving nerd who finds his groove with vocal assistance from dissimilarly attractive females. But if even one-tenth of the girls who bit into "Twilight" lend their ears to Summit's latest bid for kid cred, "Bandslam" will make its cracking voice heard amid the summer's boy-based blockbuster clique.
As much as "Bandslam" takes its dramatic cues (plus star Vanessa Hudgens) from Disney's "High School Musical" trilogy, the movie seems a natural step for co-writer/director Todd Graff, whose "Camp" put performing arts kids on the indie-film stage back in 2003. Again, Graff's ingratiating show-must-go-on(-and-on) sensibility pushes formulaic material past sweet and into sappy, as third-act scenes -- up to and including the climactic contest performance -- simply don't know when to quit.
Best by far is the film's first hour, punctuated by a funny pair of smooching scenes between geeky Will (Gaelan Connell) and each of his gal-pals, with relative newcomer Connell seeming to channel the say-anything rock-fan innocence of the young John Cusack. Introduced tapping out a plaintive email to his idol, David Bowie (who responds with a cameo late in the film), curly-haired, dewy-eyed Will becomes the new kid at Van Buren High in Lodi, N.J., when he moves there with his single mom, Karen (Lisa Kudrow).
Thrust into the standard mix of jocks, goths and goons, Will, a wallflower umbilically tied to his iPod, somehow manages to bond with both Hudgens' sullen bookworm Sa5m ("The '5' is silent," she explains) and peppy senior Charlotte (Aly Michalka), an ex-cheerleader-turned-garage-bander who recognizes Will's knowledge of vintage rock and recruits him to manage her group, Glory Dogs.
En route to securing the band a key slot in the tristate competition of the film's title, newly confident Will adds horn and string sections, plus a keyboardist, and rechristens the group I Can't Go On I'll Go On, a name that fairly summarizes the movie's own clumsy tutelage from the school of rock pics. Never more than typical tween-pop, the band's cloying tunes -- alternately sung by Michalka and the charming Hudgens -- do improve as the film goes on, enough to lend a hint of plausibility to the proceedings. Hudgens' late-period turn at the mic is particularly well suited to a performance that builds in volume as Michalka's recedes. Kudrow, if not hilarious, makes an authentic overprotective mom.
Lensed mostly in Austin, Texas, by "Juno" and "500 Days of Summer" cinematographer Eric Steelberg, Graff's pic convincingly re-creates both suburban Jersey and, for a tender exchange between Will and Sa5m, the legendary and now-closed downtown Manhattan club CBGB. More believable still is the means by which the cheesy band wins its fame: Twittering from young fans, rather than raves from old-school judges, is what counts most, and Summit may well wish the same for "Bandslam."

Deep into this latest ride on the High School Musical  bandwagon, the death of a main character's father is treated as less devastating than the social-clique intel it uncovers. Besides that bit of OMG hysteria, Todd Graff 's film is written with a desperate cleverness that clamors for attention over the brainless against-the-odds music-competition plot. Chinless new kid Will (Gaelan Connell ) finds his encyclopedic audiophilia pressed into service when nervy Charlotte  (singer Aly Michalka ) wants to enter her garage trio into a regional battle of the bands. He also finds a partner in crime in sarcastic outsider "Sa5m" (played by HSM er Vanessa Hudgens ), while his long-necked and fretful Mom (Lisa Kudrow ) hovers. Thus, Will achieves the bizarre dream of becoming a band manager, in a story littered with musical references (Bowie, CBGB ) that are more 50-year-old screenwriter than platinum teenybopper. The fleeting first kiss between Will and Sa5m is the rare sweet moment on the trudge toward the big night, when a tinny line-up of finalists in various ersatz styles climaxes with Will's nine-piece band—actually called "I Can't Go On, I'll Go On."
