It�s been a long time since The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes
 and The Barefoot Executive
, two of Kurt Russell�s career highlights from his early years as Disney�s in-house teen, but the actor has finally returned to the Magic Kingdom. (It�s almost as if Snake Plissken never happened, heaven forfend.) Russell�s film roles have always ranged among action, comedy, and romantic leads, hitting something of a trifecta with John Carpenter�s 1986 cult favorite Big Trouble in Little China
, and it�s a rare thing when a Kurt Russell film isn�t at least entertaining. His finely honed combination of aw-shucks naturalness and studied sense of laissez-faire comic timing has saved more than a few mediocrities from the direct-to-video fate they would have surely shared had Russell not been on board (say, Captain Ron
, for example). So it�s not surprising that he�s the most interesting thing in Sky High
, even if he seems to be playing a live-action version of Mr. Incredible much of the time. As the egocentric Commander Stronghold, he lives incognito with heroine wife Josie Jetstream (Preston) and son Will (Angarano), who on his first day at the titular high school for superhero offspring has yet to acquire his own superpowers. Divided into "heroes" and "sidekicks" by gung-ho gym teacher Coach Boomer, aka Sonic Boom (Campbell doing what he does best, once again), the momentarily disconsolate Will ends up tagged as hero support and makes fast pals with a quartet of other sidekicks, including a hip-hop-prone valley boy who glows ("Maybe if we could dim the lights you could see it a little better," he tells a skeptical Coach Boomer) and a surly alterna-girl whose limited shape-shifting abilities only allow her to morph into a guinea pig. His best friend since the sandbox days, Layla (Panabaker, of Wonder Falls
), is crushin� on him like mad, but with his pubescent romantic radar as yet ill-attuned, all Will can think about is his newfound archenemy, the fireball-tossing Warren Peace (Strait), whose father was vanquished by Will�s dad back in the day. It�s a spiffy set-up, but ultimately a dull and thoroughly predictable one, despite some great turns by Leachman, as the school nurse, and Kids in the Hall
 alumni Foley and McDonald, as teachers who pine for their sidekick glory days. That former Wonder Woman
 Lynda Carter is Sky High�s unflappable principal is such an easy gag that it fails to elicit much of a laugh (not to mention that the film�s target tweener audience likely hasn�t a clue who she is). There are a few moments of comic genius � Russell�s Commander Stronghold mulling over the idea of dropping Will in a vat of toxic waste to kickstart his latent powers is one of �em � but for the most part Sky High
 plays like a particularly well-budgeted parody of the old ABC Afterschool Specials
, with superpowers filling in for puberty and cliquish teen rivalries giving way to happy endings all around. It�s inoffensive and sports a positive "be yourself" message that�s obvious enough to be seen from space without benefit of hero-vision, but really, there�s very little that�s super about it.


''Sky High" is a squeaky clean, family-friendly comedy that merely sounds like an unreleased Cheech and Chong romp. Set at a high school for superheroes that literally floats in the sky (why it's all the way up there is anybody's guess), the movie sweetens the teen angst that's been known to break out like a case of acne in the best comic books.
This being a Disney joint, the psychological stress and internal struggles are replaced with such boilerplate urgencies as whom to take to the homecoming dance and at which cafeteria table to sit. The difference is that the 14- and 15-year-olds worrying about these problems can lift cars with one arm, turn into rodents, and melt into a puddle of goop. Otherwise, this is, indeed, another teen flick, a spotty, stodgily directed, though occasionally clever one, with several cardboard performances. (Lynda Carter, for instance, plays the principal, and she just sashays through on her good TV reputation. When will acting become a super power?)
Michael Angarano plays Will Stronghold, the son of the world's most famous superheroes, the Commander and Jetstream (Kurt Russell and Kelly Preston). Their earthly guises are real estate agents -- um, super
 real estate agents -- living in the suburbs. Will is about to start at his folks' alma matter, Sky High, but on the bus flight to school, he worries that he hasn't yet discovered his powers. The school is split into two tracks, heroes and sidekicks, and his failure to demonstrate a power lands him among the geeky sidekicks. This irks his gung-ho father, who fights crime in a bulky, red, white, and blue costume that makes him look like a sexy Popsicle.
Will discovers his power (super strength like his pa) during a cafeteria brawl with the school rebel, a flamethrower named Warren Peace (Steven Strait), who's mad that the Commander put his bad dad away. Will is bumped over to Sky High's hero wing, and reluctantly leaves his outcast friends behind, now that he's cool. Even the most popular girl, a ''technopath" named Gwen (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is falling for him. (That the It girl is someone who can control electronics with her mind seem wishful. Where I went to school, we called her ''nerd.")
But Gwen butters up the Strongholds and tricks Will into having a rager while his parents are on assignment. What follows is one of the least convincing house parties ever filmed. The director is Mike Mitchell -- a name I never thought I'd type again following the Ben Affleck turkey ''Surviving Christmas" -- and the superhuman circumstances do nothing for his moviemaking. Kids at that party stand around, indifferent to the watery Radio Disney covers of 1980s pop that leaks from the speakers. This, folks, is our in-crowd. But the party -- and hopefully its lack of rage -- is a ruse Gwen has concocted to humiliate Layla (Danielle Panabaker), Will's childhood best friend and former fellow sidekick, who can control plants.
Will's eco-girl versus machine-girl dilemma is the movie's most inspired development. If ''Sky High" were a cartoon -- OK, were it a better cartoon -- that relationship might have appealed to Hayao Miyazaki, the director of ''Princess Mononoke" and ''Spirited Away." As it is, the film, which is probably suitable for 6- or 7-year-olds, seems to be aiming even lower. (For starters, the adults are turned into babies at one point.)
But Russell appears to be enjoying himself, and casting Angarano to play his son was a smart choice. He looks faintly like Russell, but he also has the blend of sheepishness and confidence that made Russell such a reliable teen star in those long-ago Disney pictures. So if Angarano misses the cut for, say, an ''X-Men" sequel, there's probably a new version of ''The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes" ready to rumble down the assembly line.

         Weighed down with gimmicks and special effects, a number of which are far from special, "Sky High" is best left to 10- to 14-year-olds because it's not likely to do much for older audiences and is too violent for the very young. On the plus side, it has a likable cast headed by Michael Angarano, Kurt Russell, Kelly Preston, Danielle Panabaker, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Steven Strait. Scriptwriter Paul Hernandez is a comic-book fan, and his far-fetched fantasy might have been more persuasive as an animated film.
 
  Angarano's 14-year-old Will Stronghold lives with his loving parents (Russell and Preston) in one of those large traditional-style homes in a leafy neighborhood favored by glossy family movies. Steve and Josie Stronghold are, however, not only successful real estate agents but also superhero crime fighters, prepared to put a deal on hold on a moment's notice to don capes and tights and rush off to fight crime. As the Commander, Steve is in effect Superman, and Josie as Jetstream flies through the air at top speed. Oddly, the Strongholds' dual personalities are no secret, which gives one pause to wonder why they aren't off to Iraq or Afghanistan instead of spending so much time selling houses.
 


         






    The point is that Will, a nice, normal kid, is feeling a bit intimidated by having such formidable parents when it's time for him to be whisked off by bus to his first day of school at Sky High, a secret Shangri-La-looking edifice built on an island floating high up in the sky. The bus suddenly sprouts wings and takes off at the end of a magically truncated Colorado Street Bridge. The school is especially for Heroes, those teenagers who already possess superhuman powers, and Sidekicks, those kids who have some special gifts, such as the girl who can turn herself into a rat, but don't quite make it into the ranks of Heroes.
 
  Poor Will has yet to develop special powers of any sort and hangs with the Sidekicks, including Layla (Panabaker), whom he's known since first grade and who secretly loves him. When Will does burst through with super strength in a gladiatorial match with Strait's Warren Peace, he chafes at the jocks-and-geeks class distinctions between Heroes and Sidekicks. In the meantime, Will is immediately vamped by Gwen (Winstead), a sultry senior and student body president. That she would go after Will, still a boy, and overlook Peace, a young hunk, suggests right away that she is up to no good.
 
  Defying credibility at every turn, "Sky High" is likely to try the patience of most adults. Director Mike Mitchell and Hernandez and his co-writers Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle strive to bring a human dimension to an avalanche of fantastic developments, and the cast, which includes Lynda Carter and Cloris Leachman, succeeds pretty well, especially Russell, who plays the cocky Steve with tongue in cheek. But "Sky High" is too hopelessly contrived for its actors to be able to make it work.

Brains, brawn and beyond'' goes the motto of Sky High . Of those three, guess which ideal dominates this harmless, tween-targeted cape-capade? Perhaps that's inevitable, considering our main character is awkward frosh Will (Michael Angarano), son of the Commander (Kurt Russell), a genial meathead strongman, and his gravity-defying soul mate Jetstream (Kelly Preston). Like all good superfamilies, they send their boy to Sky High, a supposedly competitive hero academy that's a bit too Disneyfied to be Hogwarts-cutthroat. The school is distinguished principally by its location several miles above the earth. (Now, that's busing.) At first, Will exhibits no ''hero'' powers, disappointing his dad, and he takes his place among the second-class ''sidekicks.'' Then he hits superpuberty and gets caught up in a teen caste system inflated to superheroic proportions. (The results are either Day-Glo cute or darkly Nietzschean, depending entirely on your own scars.) Naturally, there's a supervillain, and naturally, lessons are learned, mostly via brute force.
Reverse-imagineered from Spy Kids  with a hint of the (ahem) incredible, Sky  deals skittishly with that status question, ending on an ''I'm okay, you're okay'' note. Visually, it aims for Best Power Rangers  Episode Ever, with a Styrofoam aesthetic that looks like it fell off a truck bound for Spencer Gifts. The flick is best in its bittier moments (watch for the stellar cameos), and there's nothing to trouble the tots. But parents beware: When American fantasies of excellence start looking this flimsy, you may get the sinking feeling that somewhere over India or China, there floats a Sky Higher .

 For anyone who hasn't grasped the connection between the ruthless pecking order of the suburban American high school and the popularity of movies and games in which geeky adolescents dream themselves into becoming superheroes, "Sky High" should help explain the world, or at least the world of entertainment.  This zippy Disney adventure-comedy, crammed with special effects, asks that age-old rhetorical question, "Is there life after high school?," and answers it with a cheerful "Not really."  The movie, directed by Mike Mitchell ("Surviving Christmas") from a screenplay by Paul Hernandez, Mark McCorkle and Bob Schooley, is a clever hybrid of Harry Potter (its nerdy 14-year-old hero, Will Stronghold, has magical powers) and "The Incredibles" (Will belongs to a family of superheroes). The live action and computer animation are so thoroughly interwoven that you can easily lose track of what is what.  In the movie's clever premise, Will (Michael Angarano) is a freshman at an elite school (Sky High) for future superheroes and heroines, situated in the stratosphere. On his first day of school, Will, in a Peter Pan moment, boards a yellow bus that looks perfectly ordinary until it sprouts wings and jet engines and lurches into the blue yonder.  Its location may be heavenly, but Sky High, which is held aloft by an antigravity mechanism and hidden above a cloud bank, is less than celestial. With its jocks, nerds, bullies and mean girls, it is just like every other suburban high school, only more so. As for the faculty, the school nurse has X-ray vision, the science teacher is a conehead, and the coach a bully.  Without bearing down too heavily, "Sky High" suggests that the rigors of high school leave permanent emotional wounds. Upon his arrival, Will finds himself lined up with the other freshmen in the gym and tested for superhero aptitude. Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell) brutally divides the incoming flock into heroes (the future stars) and sidekicks (the wannabes).  At these amusing auditions, one student shape-shifts into a guinea pig, another multiplies into a cheerleading squad, another melts into a squishy puddle of ick, and one wisp of a boy wows the student body by becoming a two-ton iron man.  Because Will's parents (both Sky High graduates) are world-class superheroes passing as real estate agents, great things are expected of their son. His father, Steve, a k a the Commander (Kurt Russell, playing it exactly right, with a slightly raised eyebrow and a faint smirk), is shown in an early scene donning Superman-like garb and saving a city from a giant robot. Will's mother, the Florence Henderson-like Josie, a k a Jetstream (Kelly Preston), has comparable gifts.  But Will, who has fooled his father into thinking he has a son who has achieved superpowers, fails his orientation and is herded into the sorry ranks of the sidekicks. He is also attacked by Warren Peace (Steven Strait), a glowering rebel who can set his hands and arms on fire at will. A divided soul, Warren is the product of a mixed marriage between a superheroine and a supervillain whom the Commander punished; he has a chip on his shoulder against the Stronghold clan.  Will's wounded confidence is boosted by the fawning attentions of Gwen Grayson (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), a senior and the most popular girl in school, who makes a beeline for him. Swept off his feet, he suddenly has no time for Layla (Danielle Panabaker), the girl next door and his closest childhood friend, who is itching to be his sweetheart and happens to have power over plants.  Because "Sky High" is a Disney family film, it can't begin to depict the adolescent temptations of drinking, drugs and sex. Although Will gives a forbidden party in his parents' home, it is strictly juice and cookies, raucous play and loud music. With little effort, Will comes into his powers, is promoted to the school's hero studies program and becomes the leader he was meant to be.  But a darker current ripples under all the superhuman perk. High school ostracism, whether avenged (as in "Carrie") or healed ("Never Been Kissed"), the movie suggests, is never forgotten. In its friendly way, "Sky High" opts for vengeance, which is wreaked at a homecoming dance by an unlikely villain. In one of the movie's wittiest conceits, many of the students are transformed into burbling infants, a nifty metaphor for what high school society, with all its jostling ids, is really all about.  "Sky High" is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has some strong language and mild innuendo.

Smartly written and sprightly played, "Sky High" satisfies with a clever commingling of spoofy superheroics, school-daze hijinks, and family friendly coming-of-age dramedy. Comparisons to "The Incredibles" are inevitable, though not entirely apt, but this lively live-action Disney release stands on its own merits as a tongue-in-cheek fantasy with cross-generational appeal. Pic could prove a surprisingly powerful performer in the late-summer B.O. sweepstakes, and will subsequently fly off shelves in homevid release. 
In developing their high-concept premise, scripters Paul Hernandez, Bob Schooley and Mark McCorkle borrow concepts and archetypes from various corners of the Marvel and DC comic-book universes. (X-Men and the Legion of Super Heroes are only the two most obvious inspirations.) Fanciful scenario can be enjoyed as both a savvy homage brimming with wink-wink inside jokes, and as a straight-ahead action-comedy about gifted teens training to join the ranks of superhumanity.
It's never easy for the offspring of celebrities to establish their own identities. But for 14-year-old Will Stronghold (Michael Angarano), it's especially difficult to emerge from the long shadows cast by his dynamic parents, the fantastically strong Commander (Kurt Russell) and the high-flying Jet Stream (Kelly Preston). When not battling evil, they're real estate agents Steve and Josie Stronghold.
With mom and dad fully expecting him to join the superhero biz, Will reluctantly begins his advanced education at their alma mater, Sky High, a lavishly appointed school on a secluded campus miles above the ground. (Thanks to anti-gravity devices, the entire campus remains permanently aloft, hidden by convenient cloud banks.) In many ways, it's a high school like any other, complete with peer pressures and polarized cliques. The big difference is, the primary division isn't between jocks and geeks. Rather, freshmen are labeled as either Heroes or Sidekicks, according to their abilities and potential.
Will almost immediately is designated as a Sidekick, with little hope for reassignment because, despite his bloodline, he evidences no sign of being superpowerful.
Helmer Mike Mitchell ("Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo") subtly handles the script's metaphorical allusions to adolescence as a time of uncertainty, evolution and establishing identity. Instead of belaboring the obvious, he plays for laughs, keeping the pic light even during elaborate action sequences.
As a Sidekick, Will feels at ease with other dweebs: Layla (Danielle Panabaker), who reins in her powers to control plant life in order to remain Will's classmate; Ethan (Dee-Jay Daniels), who can melt into a puddle; Magenta (Kelly Vitz), a shape-shifter who, alas, can only shape herself into a guinea pig; and Zach (Nicholas Brown), who can glow like a nightlight.
On the other hand, Will can't avoid clashes with Warren Peace (Steven Strait), who can toss fireballs from his fingertips -- and who nurses a grudge against Will because the latter's parents arrested Warren's super-villainous father.
Under the watchful eye of shape-shifting Principal Powers (former "Wonder Woman" Lynda Carter) and the demanding tutelage of high-decibel Coach Boomer (Bruce Campbell), Will eventually discovers his super strength.
Beautiful classmate Gwen Grayson (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) can't help but notice. However, Layla isn't pleased that her old friend is being a mite too friendly with someone else.
Narrative is fueled by the mischief caused by a vengeful villain who targets the Commander, Jet Stream and other Sky High alumni. But funniest bits of "Sky High" have relatively little to do with its serviceably comic-bookish plot. Slyly self-satirical perfs by Russell and Preston are consistently delightful, and various oddball touches trigger guffaws of assorted intensity.
In addition to spot-on contributions from Carter and Campbell, funny character turns by Dave Foley (as a former teen sidekick), Kevin McDonald (as a brainy science teacher) and, briefly, Cloris Leachman (as a nurse with x-ray vision) increase the laugh quotient.
Angarano hits the right notes of sincerity and uncertainty while making an engaging impression. Supporting roles are vividly played, with Kevin Heffernan a standout as a gung-ho but super-powerless bus driver for Sky High (portrayed, in a bold stroke of casting, by Cal State U., Northridge).
Overall tech package is sufficiently first-rate to providing some semblance of credibility while sustaining seriocomic tone. (Even f/x tricks are laced with humor.) Costume designer Michael Wilkinson has created a lineup of nifty superhero attire, and music supervisor Lisa Brown has assembled a bevy of covers of well-chosen '80s pop hits.

Keying into and then subverting the wish fulfillment at the heart of most comic books, Sky High  envisions a world where all superheroes learn to use their abilities at the titular training academy, which practices a sort of state-sponsored stratifying in the stratosphere. The floating school categorizes all incoming freshman as either heroes or sidekicks, essentially a superpowered shorthand for jocks and dweebs. High 's protagonists are a group of awkward sidekicks who discover the "heroes" are actually a bunch of pompous douche bags planning to destroy the school with a device known as "The Pacifier." The film's message (tolerance and equality for all who combat the evils of Vin Diesel  movies) is powerful; the supporting cast, including Dave Foley , Kevin McDonald , and Bruce Campbell , is up for anything; and the story, though predictable, is littered with knowing touches and smart moments, like the character whose duplication powers create a squad of cheerleaders who look, sound, and act exactly alike. Sky High  is clunky and shamelessly transparent, but it's also charmingly earnest, and well designed for kids. My 12-year-old self would have liked this movie a lot. The 25-year-old me likes it a bit more than he cares to admit.
