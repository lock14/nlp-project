 Alexander Sokurov’s “Alexandra”  —  a film of startling originality and beauty  —  feels like a communiqué from another time, another place, anywhere but here. Mr. Sokurov, a Russian director best known in America for “Russian Ark” (2002), makes films so far removed from the usual commercial blather  that it sometimes seems as if he’s working in a different medium. His work is serious, intense, at times opaque and so feverishly personal that it also feels as if you’re being invited into his head, not just another reality.  The head that Mr. Sokurov invites you into here ostensibly belongs to his title character, an elderly woman visiting her grandson at the Chechen front. The name Alexandra scarcely seems coincidental, and neither does the unusual casting. Alexandra is played by the soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, the widow of the cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich, about whom Mr. Sokurov recently made a  documentary.  In 1978 the Soviet government stripped the dissident couple (Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn lived at their dacha) of their citizenship. Mr. Rostropovich gave an impromptu cello concert next to the Berlin Wall after it fell and, with his wife, returned home after the collapse of the Soviet Union. When Ms. Vishnevskaya, now 81, enters this film she carries with her the weight of history.  She looks as if  she can handle it. Invested with unmistakable  hauteur  —  her intense, flashing eyes lock on their targets like tracking beams  —  Ms. Vishnevskaya reminds me of nothing so much as one of those well-seasoned, time-toughened divas for whom the word no is never an option, even in the middle of a war zone.  When the film opens, Alexandra has just come from her home elsewhere in Russia, an elliptically rendered trip that ends with her literally waddling into the Chechen front towing a small wheeled shopping cart. She’s a dumpling of a woman, and with her cart and head scarf she looks as if she’s going marketing, but she’s actually visiting her grandson, Denis (Vasily Shevtsov), an unmarried 27-year-old captain who’s been at war too long.  Much of “Alexandra” unfolds at the military base where Denis is stationed, a ramshackle warren of wooden barracks and walkways often clouded with swirling dust. The purpose of her visit remains vague. Recently widowed, she misses Denis, but she’s also curious about his life and the war. Over the next few days and nights, she roams about the base, talking with Denis and the other soldiers, climbing in and out of military vehicles while emitting a stream of murmurs, mutters and oy, oy, oy.  At one point she ventures off base, where she meets a Chechen woman, Malika (Raisa Gichaeva), who says the Russian soldiers always look so small to her. And, she adds with a rueful smile, there are so many of them.  Ms. Vishnevskaya is a small woman, at least vertically, or maybe she just looks tiny next to all those soldiers. Yet she’s also monumental, a formidable, almost epic presence even when she’s wearily sinking onto a bench or shrinking down to a speck against the vast, dusty landscape. But Alexandra is never lost, even in this strange land that she barrels into with such confidence —  poise that at times borders on swagger. “Alexandra” has been called an antiwar film by some, but I’m not so sure that it is, even if it’s by no means pro-war. The tenderness with which Mr. Sokurov films these young soldiers with their downy necks and diffident smiles  —  they look at Alexandra with crushing yearning  —  seems proof enough of that.  Mr. Sokurov has said that “Alexandra” is about the eternal life of Russia, a sentiment that might sound mawkish or obscene coming from another filmmaker. But “Alexandra” strikes me as an enormously honest work, not just because there is palpable truth in its very location (it was shot in Chechnya, including in and around the capital, Grozny) but also because of the contradictions it lays open like a wound. There’s a stunning moment early in the film when Denis invites his grandmother into an armored vehicle. Squeezed into this metal tomblike space, she sniffs the air and remarks on the bad smell. It’s the odor of men and metal, says Denis, who then passes her a Kalashnikov. She grips the rifle easily, her eyes narrowing.  The terror in this moment is unmistakable, and then, in an instant, it’s gone. Much like the film itself, which offers lovely images amid horrifying devastation, the character of Alexandra contains multitudes that invest the film with a peculiar tension. With his roving camera, Mr. Sokurov follows Alexandra around faithfully, but he also makes time and space for the world she inhabits, a world partly made by war: ruined buildings with their fronts torn away, rows upon rows of military boots and uniforms (almost all that’s for sale at the market), the haunted, haunting eyes of unsmiling young Chechen men. Mr. Sokurov’s images speak so eloquently he doesn’t need many words.  I’ve seen “Alexandra” twice, and there are things in this remarkable film  —  bits of dialogue, one or two references and certainly the great heaviness of Russian identity  —  that remain out of my grasp. This may seem like a surprising confession, but art, including that created in Hollywood, rarely if ever reveals itself instantaneously. That may sound self-evident, though given the diminished appetite in America for serious films it bears repeating. “Alexandra” isn’t a difficult film, but neither is it obvious. It’s a beautiful, eerie work of art about life and death and the love a grandson expresses when he plaits his grandmother’s hair. It has revealed some of its mysteries, and I’m sure it will reveal more when I return to it again.

Though he's sure to deny it, "Alexandra" is Alexander Sokurov's most directly political work for years. Featuring a performance of monumental depth by opera legend Galina Vishnevskaya, pic presents war for what it is: brutal, crushing, and ugly, and yet Sokurov doesn't lens any battles. These wounds are deeper, coming from the endlessness of a war (Chechnya, but also anywhere) that bleaches the soul as surely as Sokurov's striking trademark monochrome palette. Less accessible to general auds than "The Sun," pic deserves major accolades from fests as well as discerning arthouses.

A Russian grandmother visits a military base in Alexander Sokurov's Competition film 'Alexandra.'
"Alexandra" inhabits a world of specificity and universality. The setting is Chechnya, and Alexandra's questioning of "what is the Fatherland?" is an undeniable critique of that particular conflict, sure to make Vladimir Putin mighty uncomfortable. But Sokurov uses this one seemingly endless conflict to reflect upon the totality of the war experience, not in some superficial and sentimental way but by revealing the loss of basic humanity.
Elderly, no-nonsense Alexandra Nikolaevna (Vishnevskaya) arrives at her grandson's army base after a long journey. She hasn't seen Denis (Vasily Shevtsov) in seven years; following the initial joy of meeting he takes her on a tour of the base, where she watches soldiers barely old enough to grow facial hair cleaning their guns. Later on Denis gives her a Kalashnikov to hol. "It's so easy" she says, surprise and unease in her voice, after she pulls the trigger.
There are frequent comments on the stifling heat, and the smells the soldiers have gotten used to but which invade Alexandra's nostrils anew in each barrack. Humanity wanders, confused, in the soldier's camp just as Alexandra wanders. Glances, gazes, searching looks form a key element to the film, not just Alexandra's visual examination of her surroundings (especially people) but the soldiers' stares back at her, a civilian, a woman, a representative of the warmth of home life that's taken on almost alien qualities from being so distant.
"You've been fighting for so long," she tells Denis' commander. "You know how to destroy, but do you know how to build?" Uninterested in rules, Alexandra walks from the base to the local market where she meets Malika (Raisa Gichaeva), a former teacher around her own age now trying to scrape by with a cigarette stall. Seeing Alexandra's exhaustion, she takes her to her apartment, in a barely habitable, shelled building, where they share a cup of tea and the kind of neighborly warmth denied their grandsons.
For Sokurov, there are no enemies, just artificially created distrust that's seeped into the environment like mustard gas. Denis is delighted to see his grandmother, but as a soldier he's been removed from the bonds of home. "When are you getting married?" she keeps asking, as all good grandmothers ask, but he's barely able to sustain a personal conversation let alone a relationship outside the military. Denis knows how to shoot, she says to the commander, but when he's discharged (an uncertain future conditional tense to be sure), what else will he be capable of achieving?
On paper it might be easy to imagine Alexandra as some wishy-washy, simplistic character: not at all. She's formidably solid, weakened physically by age but very much the kind of Russian woman burnished by WWII -- unsentimental and fearless. Vishnevskaya captures all this, and much more. A life of struggle and dignity emanates from every pore. Sure, she's Mother Russia, but she's every mother viewing the wasted lives of young men and wondering why. Hers is no operatic performance, a la Maria Callas: this is the soul of Eleonora Duse.
Shot in and around Grozny, with lenser Alexander Burov (d.p. on "Father and Son"), pic utilizes the war-torn atmosphere while giving it an almost studio-like intensity. No one understands the effectiveness of muted colors like Sokurov, and "Alexandra" is perhaps his most effective use to date. Fields are bleached in the sun and baked in a brutally harsh light; dusk takes on camouflage hues, while night is an unwelcoming darkness. By removing the rainbow, Sokurov reminds the viewer just how joyous color can be.
Andrei Sigle's moving compositions recall the sweep of late 19th century Russian composers, and Sokurov expertly weaves in the music to heighten an honest emotional resonance. His penultimate film, "Elegy of Life," profiled Vishnevskaya and husband Rostropovich, but no one could have guessed he'd find a way to use her magic in such a non-musical way.

Spare yet tactile, a mysterious mixture of lightness and gravity, Alexander Sokurov 's Alexandra  is founded on contradiction. Musing on war in general and the Russian occupation of Chechnya  in particular, this is a movie in which combat is never shown. The star, octogenarian Galina Vishnevskaya , is an opera diva who never sings.
Sokurov, who has more than once attempted to document the Russian soul, may be a visionary, but his eponymous protagonist is resolutely down-to-earth. An instant anomaly, Alexandra clambers out from a transport train into a dusty station—presumably at some point during the second Chechen war. Stern and stolid, when not sighing with annoyance, the old lady is surrounded by Russian troops and a swirl of whispers, laughs, and faint melody. Atmosphere is everything. (And, of course, the filmmaking is masterful: Alexandra  is crisply shot and impeccably framed, less impressionistic than earlier Sokurov films, with an audio tapestry as densely woven as any by David Lynch  or Gus Van Sant .)
Alexandra has come to see her grandson, an army captain in his late twenties. She's escorted to the base, at one point riding in a tank. The soldiers love her. It's as if the resolute babushka from the famous World War II poster, "The Motherland-Mother Calls," had suddenly materialized among them. Alexandra 's fierce, blunt busybody is almost a monument—as Vishnevskaya herself is considered a national treasure. Weary and indomitable, she has no sense of her own incongruity; she's too busy studying the faces of the troops around her. (She loves them as well.) The next morning, Alexandra wakes up in her grandson's tent, finds him there, and laughs for joy.
The son of a Soviet military officer, Sokurov spent his childhood moving from base to base, and there's a mascot quality to Alexandra as she makes her tour of inspection. The movie has no shortage of incident, but it's less a narrative than a situation: The emphasis is on boredom and routine. Alexandra peers in on shirtless soldiers at their ablutions; she's handed a Kalashnikov to examine (which she does with aplomb). Blunt and plainspoken, she responds to the smells, the heat, and the discomfort: "My God, it's stifling." Totally unintimidated in her wanderings, the old lady scolds one soldier for playing with his weapon; asked for food by another, she rummages in her capacious bag and pulls out a homemade meat pie. Abruptly, Sokurov cuts to a shockingly beautiful long shot of a flaming landscape.
Her grandson back out on patrol, Alexandra leaves the base on a mission of her own to procure sweets and cigarettes for the sentries. En route to town, she finds ample evidence of the war's destruction. The landscape is a wasteland, the city is rubble, and the marketplace is filled with sullen Chechens. Alexandra manages to engage the elderly women there, evoking an international of grandmothers in a scene that would have been far more sentimental were it not so predicated on the bone-weariness of old age. Now that she has the lay of the land, willful Alexandra has words with her grandson. She is not without certain anti-Chechen prejudices (kidnapping is "in their genes"), but she identifies with their plight. Moreover, she wants to know why he is engaged in this sterile occupation. Why hasn't he married? He tells her that family is even more oppressive than the army.
Sokurov may be unconscious of the unconscious but, in his movies, history typically dissolves into the psychosexual. His last meditation on the military, the wacky Father and Son , used the passionate filial relationship between an army officer and his teenage boy to celebrate the state as a near-fascist expression of masculine authority. Alexandra  has more to do with patriotism as a tragic and irrational affection for a cranky motherland. Grandma and grandson reconcile in a scene of near-erotic fondness, complete with inscribed voyeur, in which he brushes and braids her coarse gray hair. The next morning, she leaves—having accomplished what exactly?
In her recent history of Russian war films, scholar Denise Youngblood  notes that the half-dozen movies treating the Chechen conflict fall into two categories. There are the internationalist films like Sergei Bodrov 's Prisoner of the Caucasus  , which romanticize the conflict, casting the Chechens as oriental Others, and there are chauvinist films like Aleksei Balabanov's War , which sound a warning against encroaching barbarism. Alexandra  is neither. The conflict is an existential condition; Sokurov's subject, in his own words, is "the eternal life of Russia . . . There is not a single word that could not have been sounded forty years ago." (Is Russia then defined as a nation forever under occupation?)
Unlike earlier filmmakers, Sokurov insisted on making the film on location in Chechnya. Let the earth and the air speak. His camera maneuvers to capture precise slivers of sunlight on the ground; the color is sun-bleached, the clouds of dust rise just so. The effect is fastidious, but too ethereal to be oppressive. Sokurov may not clarify the situation in Chechnya but, in chronicling Alexandra's trip to the front, he illuminates its reality.
