Genre fans will remember directo Stockwell from his role as good-guy Dennis in John Carpenter's adaptation of Stephen King's killer car opus Christine
 (or possibly as Spider in Losin' It
), but he's grown up in the interim and helmed a pair of inoffensive wetsploitation numbers (Blue Crush
, Into the Blue
) that were filled with the sort of tanned, lithe teenage bodies that, in horror films, tend to spurt the most post-canoodle gore. With Turistas
, Stockwell dives head-first into a veritable riptide of churning, vicious exploitation cinema, and the result is surprisingly effective. Taking many of its cues from genre bible The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
, Stockwell and writer Michael Ross have managed to update the tired and tiring tropes of your standard teens-in-peril outing by taking them south of the border (to Brazil) and stranding them in the at-first lush and inviting, then hostile rain forest, where they run afoul of a rural sawbones who apparently did his internship under Dr. Butcher, M.D. (that's Medical Deviate, should you wonder). The luckless teens comprise four yanquis led by level-headed siblings Alex and Bea (Duhamel and Wilde), two British lager louts (Askew and Brown), and Aussie Pru (George), the only one among them who speaks Portuguese. After a calamitous bus accident, the group discovers a beachfront paradise populated by many supermodel types and one ingratiating local named Kiko (Steib), who charmingly practices his ESL skills on them before leading them into the jungle, through an underwater cavern system, and into the isolated bed-sitter of the aforementioned physician (very well played by Miguel Lunardi), where, as they say, the magic happens. Turistas
 is being tagged as a down-market version of Eli Roth's Hostel
, but that's lazy criticism and obscures the fact that, if anything, this is the more compelling film, commingling as it does echoes of everything from Ruggero Deodato and Umberto Lenzi's ultrarealistic green hell horrors, the spelunking aspects of The Descent
, and Marino Girolami's scalpel-happy Cannibal Holocaust
 aka Doctor Butcher, M.D.
 Very believably acted throughout and featuring a literally breathless underwater sequence of cat-and-mouse, Turistas
 is, surprising, given its lousy marketing campaign and thankless release date, a solidly visceral piece of work. Socialized health care never sounded so good.


So let's see. You're in the hinterlands of Brazil, and the bus you've been on for hours just toppled over the side of a hill. It'll be at least another half a day until the next one comes. But you see a pair of girls walking down the road sipping fruity drinks, and, forgetting that you're stranded but not that you're on vacation, you hike for your own fruity drink. Back home you'd go to a Jamba Juice, but here you turn up a cabaña next to a shimmering oasis.
The beer is plentiful and the hip-hop seductive, so you, your cute sister, her hot blond friend, some Australian chick (obligatorily in cornrows, but crucially a Portuguese speaker), and two mates from London (one far more exasperating than the other) drink and dance. But when you wake up the next day, someone's run off with everything, including your group's common sense.
Through jungles and shantytowns, you drift wet and shoeless, without a clue that the friendly local who came to your rescue after one of the Brits hit a kid with a rock is leading you to a fate worse than any Brazilian wax. Yet in spite of the oncoming doom (even the hawks circling above know what's up), you simply cannot pass up the opportunity to jump in a big blue lake. Forget imminent death -- look, a waterfall!
No, despite what the previews promise and what the cast of young white hotties you've mostly never heard of before would lead one to expect (TV's Josh Duhamel being excused), "Turistas" is not a slasher film -- not conventionally. Released by Fox's new teen division, it's the latest aquatic titillation from John Stockwell, the man who also brought us "Blue Crush" and the shockingly good "Into the Blue."
Stockwell has no use for cheap scares and bloodbaths. It's possible that Michael Arlen Ross wrote this script aiming for a queasy Yanks-abroad exploitation picture, one akin to last year's "Hostel." Instead, he gets an exploitation flick closer to MTV's "Real World/Road Rules Challenge": skin, shouting, swimming.
"Turistas" has only hints of the unforeseen soulfulness of "Into the Blue." Jessica Alba, Paul Walker, and Scott Caan cut sexily through that thriller's Caribbean Sea like gym-toned merpeople. "Turistas" is at least absorbing and only sometimes beyond the pale. Sure, Brazil's endless caste tensions provide a sort of deus ex machina, but the villain is one of those cerebral sadists who enjoys prattling away while he cuts. And Stockwell demonstrates an unsettling interest in the stomach-turning -- staples to a gash, wood skewers to the eye -- like a man desperate to score with the Fangoria crowd.
Naturally, his moviemaking only comes truly alive when water's added, which is good news for the suspenseful undersea climax that comes after a long tropical downpour. H2O, for Stockwell, promises an entirely other universe, a dimension that's beautiful, obviously, but ominous, too. With "Turistas," he's stuck with a silly plot and characters that make you sometimes wish the movie were a cheap slasher picture after all. But water here makes even these endangered mannequins seem worth saving.


         "I wanna go home," a young woman whimpers in the first scene of "Turistas." She's strapped to an operating table, and to judge from her muffled shrieks and the malevolent-looking figure reflected in her pupil, the procedure under way is something other than routine. Thus begins the first release from Fox Atomic (20th Century Fox's new genre division), a wholly predictable bit of slasher unpleasantness and a muddled cautionary tale on the American propensity for foreign misadventures.
 
  Set on the beaches and in the rain forests of rural Brazil, the movie is a scenic variation on this year's "Hostel," which devised some gruesome fates for Ugly Americans at play in the former Eastern Bloc. The stereotypical Brazilian backdrop of free-flowing caipirinhas
 and bikini-clad babes is a natural fit for the teen-horror genre, where the karmic laws are rooted in a deep, punitive puritanism. The bumbling British sex tourists will be duly sacrificed. But not before the buxom blond whose only memorable line is "Would you guys mind if I went topless?"
 


         






    "Turistas" seeks to exploit the current craze for torture-porn, but it lacks the relentless sadism of the "Saw" franchise. More than half the movie is dull buildup, as the lambs (clueless gringo tourists, thrown together after a bus accident) are herded slowly to the slaughter (an organ-harvesting mad doctor).
 
  This is the first horror effort from director John Stockwell, a pro at aquatic voyeurism ("Blue Crush," "Into the Blue"). Here he hurries through the gross-out centerpiece as if himself grossed out and reverts to what he knows best. "Turistas" climaxes with a long, dark pursuit through a warren of underwater caves. The intent may be to induce claustrophobia, but the sequence is so murky and disjointed that it inspires only confusion.
 
  Every now and again, "Turistas" connects with the harsh reality of the real world — one in which, thanks to the ongoing war in Iraq, Americans are increasingly viewed as imperialist aggressors. There is one political diatribe against the sins of the rapacious First World, but it loses much of its sting for being delivered by the evil doctor (Miguel Lunardi) as he rummages about in someone's abdominal cavity.
 
  The heroes (led by a leaden Josh Duhamel) are punished for their insensitivities and their invasiveness: assuming Brazilians speak Spanish, not Portuguese, and taking photos of local kids as if they were zoo exhibits. But "Turistas" — in bearing out their worst fears and then some — is less a critique than an embodiment of paranoid xenophobia.
 
  MPAA rating: R for strong graphic violence and disturbing content, sexuality, nudity, drug use and language. Running time: 1 hour, 29 minutes. In general release.   

Would you believe it if I said that the fearsome homicidal baddie in Turistas  is the most humane and morally responsible person in the movie? Stranded by a bus accident during a humdinger of a party-hearty vacation in Brazil, a group of young revelers, played by pretty ciphers like Josh Duhamel and Melissa George in the usual wisps of clothing, find a bar on a beach, where they drink, dance, and wake up to discover they've been drugged and robbed. What they don't realize is that they're the prey of Zamora (Miguel Lunardi), a surgeon in a righteous huff over the parasitical underground market for vital organs in countries like his own. Once the fresh-meat tourists have been lured to his rain-forest lair, he decides on a cornrowed Aussie baby doll and, as she lies naked, removes her liver. As he explains during the procedure, he plans to ship the organ to a hospital in Rio, where, for once, it can be transplanted into the body of a needy, impoverished Brazilian.
This guy, in other words, is Leatherface meets Doctors Without Borders. The movie, with the exception of that lone squirmy surgery scene, is Hostel  without sadism, thrills, or funky severed-limb F/X. It quickly turns into a very dull escape thriller. Turistas  actually has a talented director, John Stockwell, who made Blue Crush  and crazy/beautiful , but his attempt to humanize a genre that was long ago taken over by sniveling gore geeks results in a film that thinks it's doing something it's not: giving kids a ''message.'' The only message they'll receive is, Skip this one.

 If stupidity were a crime, the nitwits in the cheap horror flick “Turistas” would be doing time in Attica. A grubby, lethally dull bid to cash in on the new extreme horror, the film turns on a conceit as frayed as Freddy Krueger’s shtick: a group of hotties stumble into the lair of a madman. Carnage ensues. Here the hapless, clueless and braless are the English-speaking tourists of the film’s title who, having gone abroad to party hearty, end up being batted about by a wacky cat with very sharp claws and a seriously sick sense of social justice.  Although his heart clearly isn’t in the more unsavory aspects of the job, namely slicing and dicing, the director, John Stockwell, does make a faint, early effort to infuse the proceedings with a smidgen of humor. The opening scene of a Brazilian bus careering wildly on a twisty rural road while the sweaty, swarthy bus driver rummages inside his nostrils (and wrestles a shift stick adorned with a pentagram), does manage to squeeze some dubious humor from the image of the freaked-out white  tourist. The only problem is that in this case those fears turn out to be entirely justified, since it isn’t long before the bus is sliding down a mountain, taking that initial flicker of amused reflexivity with it.  What follows is the old splatter and scream as the interchangeable pretty girls and hard-body boys are lined up like ducks  to be shot down or, in the case of one turista, gutted while still conscious. (The actors playing the ducks are similarly interchangeable; you can find their names in the accompanying credit box.) This operation, which isn’t any more disgusting than  the medical surgeries that crop up on television  — though it’s considerably less well-lighted —  is as laughable as it is repulsive. That’s especially true when the evil doctor,  Zamora (Miguel Lunardi, eyeballs popping), places one victim’s internal organs next to her fetching naked breast, a gesture that neatly encapsulates the sexual panic and misogyny that characterize the stupidest examples of extreme horror.  Apologists for vivisectionist entertainment trot out all sorts of rationales to justify the spectacle of human torture instead of just admitting that such spectacles turn them on. In this respect the horror audience, in its enthusiasm for go-go gore, is far more honest than those who hide behind the fig leaf of radical politics. Like “Hostel” (a critique of American arrogance, don’tcha know), which seems the most direct inspiration for “Turistas,” this film involves first-world tourists who are violently punished for traveling into a third-world (or third-world-like) country. “Turistas” plays this political angle more openly than does “Hostel,” since Zamora defends his blood lust by donating “gringo” organs to his country’s poor. Yeah, yeah, yeah,  and Jason and Freddy donate regularly to their local blood banks.  Advancements in special effects have made it easier than ever to make fictional disembowelments and the  like look super-realistic. And  on a fundamental level, the charnel-house aesthetics of films like “Hostel,” “Cabin Fever” and the remake of “The Texas Chain Saw Massacre”  are not any different from the graphic passages in films like “Saving Private Ryan” and “Flags of Our Fathers.” The goals of these war movies are certainly far loftier than those of a run-of-the-mill horror divertissement, but in the end they all traffic —  in part or in whole — in convincing images of extreme human suffering. Some films do it for art; others for amusement.  For better and at times for worse, though,  the cinema of death now appears inescapable.  “Turistas” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The usual torture mixed in with gunplay, open wounds, beer, pot, discreet sex and naked female breasts.

Yanks vacationing way South-of-the-border face a fate far worse than stomach cramps and diarrhea in "Turistas." Indie pickup is first release for youth-slanted genre shingle Fox Atomic, and, with an advertising budget reportedly three times the pic's $10 million production cost, this "Hostel"-with-a-tan-line is sure to soak up some counter-programming cash in a seasonal marketplace currently short on horror fare. The unsavory effort will doubtless be Christmas trash soon enough, but ancillary life should raise its cast casualties from the dead for further monetary gain by Easter. 
The "Hostel" similarities may strike some as too close for comfort, not only in plot outline but also in general mix of xenophobia, sexploitation, sadism and gore. Like Eli Roth's soon-to-be-sequelized hit, this knockoff is more icky than scary, with a rather obnoxious Ugly American as lead protagonist. Pic's simple advice to viewers who might want to wander in the non-Michelin-Guided world: For god's sake don't do it! They hate us! Not only do those foreigners speak crazy non-speakee-English lingos, but half of them are crazies and sickos!! Anyone judging the U.S. by its movies -- as millions do -- will likely decide this latest horror trend makes us look pretty damn dumb.
After opening teaser of coming gory attractions, a rapid-fire credits montage encapsulates pic's perspective on Latin America as Tantalizing Pleasures vs. Harrowing Squalor.
Bossy Alex (Josh Duhamel) has been dragged along to chaperone sister Bea (Olivia Wilde) and pal Amy (Beau Garrett) on their tour of off-the-beaten-path Brazil. The path at present is a winding coastal road which their bus driver careens along heedlessly.
When Alex yells at the lead footed driver, the girls tell him to shut up. But, moments later, they all barely escape before the vehicle totters off an embankment. They are told a replacement bus won't arrive for hours.
Now joined by randy Brits Finn (Desmond Askew) and Liam (Max Brown), plus Portuguese-fluent Aussie Pru (Melissa George), the Yanks head for a nearby beach bar. Indeed, the beach proves so gorgeous they decide to miss their bus and stay overnight. Much revelry ensues, but next morning the friendly locals -- along with the tourists' luggage, cash and passports -- are long gone. They look for help but inadvertently provoke nearby villagers and are urged by new buddy Kiko (Agles Steib) to scram into the jungle, where he's got a "safe" house they can stay in until the next transit comes.
Natch, this house is a very long, isolated walk away. Upon arriving (after a pit stop to explore semi-submerged caves behind a waterfall), the visitors find suspicious items galore: Surveillance cameras, an excess of medical supplies, caged dogs, and a cache of tourist passports. Uh-oh. Then sinister Dr. Zamora (Miguel Lunardi) arrives by helicopter, and hints of a murderous organ-transplant trade prove true as, during the next 15 minutes (arriving almost exactly an hour in), the protags' ranks thin rapidly.
Horror fans pleased by this turn may feel cheated when "Turistas" then spends its final quarter-hour back in the underwater caves, with a whole lotta anxious swimming rather than more horrific action. While this too is unpleasant (in a fear-of-drowning way), it's more like a sequel to aquatic thriller "Into the Blue" (helmer John Stockwell's last pic) than "Hostel" or even cave-bound chiller "The Descent." Result is ultimately silly and forgettable.
Still, if it lacks "Hostel's" distinctive sleaziness, "Turistas" does have one idea as offensive as anything in that gagfest: Zamora explains he yanks organs from (still-conscious) "gringo American tourists" and donates them to a Rio People's Hospital in order to "even the scales" against First World imperialism. (Thanks for this tasteless "irony" should be addressed to first-time scenarist Michael Arlen Ross.)
Of course, Zamora later barks "You stupid Indian, do what I say, I OWN you!" at a dark-skinned flunky. No doubt Brazil (where pic was actually shot) will enjoy its depiction here just as much as the Czech Republic did "Hostel."
Locations and widescreen lensing are attractive, tech aspects overall a cut above B-grade horror average. Cast is well-toned.

Explore the labyrinthian depths and secret alleys of the Walter Reade 's annual survey "Spanish Cinema Now" (December 8 through 26), and you'll find a mini retrospective devoted to Edgar Neville  (18991967). The aristocratic Neville  was a friend of Luis Buñuel  and Charlie Chaplin  (whom he met while in Hollywood  directing Spanish-language talkies for MGM), with a reputation as a raconteur that's fully justified by the playful narratives of his best-known movies. Those showing include Life Hanging by a Thread  (1945), a whimsical comedy of alternate destiny; two murder mysteries: the farcical Carnival Sunday  (1945) and philosophical The Crime on Bordadores Street  (1946); as well as a neorealist account of a demobilized cavalryman, The Last Horse  (1950), and a color musical, Flamenco (1952).
The most fabulous of Neville's fantasies is The Tower of the Seven Hunchbacks  (1944), a supernatural shaggy-dog story in which, egged on by a dignified one-eyed ghost, a handsome if clueless Madrid  bon vivant stumbles into a lost subterranean world. This secret city, built by Jews escaping the Inquisition, is populated by a cabal of sinister, coin-counterfeiting kyphotics, as well as a number of cobwebbed mummies and a mad archaeologist. The movie was evidently based on a horror novel but Neville's attitude toward this fantastic material is beyond bemused.
