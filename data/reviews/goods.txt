Despite a rotten title and a bottomless reserve of cynical, scattershot humor, The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard
 is a swift-moving, equal-opportunity offender about a team of used-car liquidators hired to save a Temecula, Calif., dealership from bankruptcy with a Fourth of July weekend blowout sale. Deriving much of its energy from Piven�s tightly wound Don Ready, head of the liquidation crew, the film flings about insults and crass jokes with the abandon of a more Middle-American-seeming Ari Gold (Piven�s character on Entourage
). Although it treads much of the same ground, this comedy is no Used Cars
, the 1980 standard-bearer of car-dealership comedies. However, The Goods
� retreads ought to pick up some quick mileage at the box office before running out of gas. Ready, whose business card reads, �I Move Cars, Motherfucker,� is contacted while eating breakfast in a strip club with his three-person crew (Rhames, Koechner, and Hahn). Off they go to Temecula, despite carrying (as they so tastefully describe it) the stink of customers left over from their just-completed job. Once there, they find a car lot whose characters are just as screwed up as they are, only in different, less cynical ways. Ben Selleck (Brolin), the owner of Temecula�s Selleck Motors, gets an instant hard-on for Ready�s loan specialist Brent Gage (Koechner), his daughter Ivy (Spiro) is engaged to a doofus from the town�s import-car scion (Helms), and his son Peter (Riggle) is a 10-year-old boy trapped in a 30-year-old man�s body. Much humor is derived from the sexual overtures Babs (Hahn) makes toward the boy. An unbilled Will Ferrell, a co-producer along with Gary Sanchez Productions partners Adam McKay and Chris Henchy, also makes a goofy extended cameo. First-time director Brennan manages to keep a tight rein on this galloping sprawl, a strategy he may have honed as a writer and producer of the brilliant but chaotic Chappelle�s Show
. The film�s tone, however, never fully congeals. The script by Andy Stock and Rick Stempson (Balls Out: Gary the Tennis Coach
) can, at times, be a nasty piece of work, and no amount of laughter will fully obscure the gag reflex that occasionally forms in the back of your throat.

The government recently decided to subsidize the purchase of new automobiles for Americans driving alleged junk. The program is called Cash for Clunkers. But anyone looking for a cheap, timely vicarious alternative might try “The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard,’’ a comedy set on a used-car lot in Temecula, Calif. You put up the cash, the movie clunks.
It’s conceivable that the filmmakers were prescient about the states of the economy and the auto industry. But these are some of the same people  - namely executive producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay  - who  lifted their legs and did their business all over local TV news (“Anchorman’’), stockcar racing (“Talladega Nights’’), and brotherhood (“Step Brothers’’). Sharp social satire is not in the cards. Sadly, neither is farce, which is what the three previous movies gleefully had in common. “The Goods’’ has its exuberant moments. But the people behind the camera don’t appear to know what they’re doing as well as those in front of it.
The film sics a quartet of car sales consultants on a sputtering dealership that needs help. The head sales guru, Don Ready (Jeremy Piven), vows to move all 211 cars off the lot of a veteran owner (James Brolin) before a slick rival (Alan Thicke) takes over the space so his son and the veteran’s future son-in-law (Ed Helms) can have a space to rehearse  - sigh  - his boy band. The veteran’s daughter (Jordana Spiro) has also come home to help out.
It seems as if the writers, Andy Stock and Rick Stempson, have watched a lot of Ferrell and McKay’s work, more than their share of mawkish television, and Robert Zemeckis’s hardworking 1980 comedy, “Used Cars.’’ If I were Zemeckis, I would save the lawyer for a worthier cause. “Used Cars’’ was marred by ambition. “The Goods,’’ like a lot of current comedies, suffers from cynical laziness. The marketing department will get you to come. Once you’re there, what can you do?
The filmmakers jerk between random gags, many of which feel like very funny outtakes, and earnest strands of story. There’s plenty of time to contemplate Piven’s limitations as a comic actor. When he can’t be obnoxious or aggrieved, there’s not much more to him than the mysteries of his hair. You want to touch it just to see if an alarm goes off.
The rest of the cast  - which includes Ving Rhames, David Koechner, Kathryn Hahn, Craig Robinson, Rob Riggle, Tony Hale, Charles Napier, and Ken Jeong  - seems blissfully ignorant of what’s what. They play would-be sincere material with almost as much funk as they do the gags. To them it’s all one long fart joke.
The director, Neal Brennan, was a big part of the fearless “Chappelle’s Show’’ (oh, how it is missed). His affection for the grit and vulgarity of black comedy are the only inspired moments in the movie. When Farrell shows up for one of his cameos, he’s flanked by two angels who sing backup while he whines. Gwen Stewart and Courtney Alain Bradshaw play the angels, and they’re effortlessly funny. If there were any justice in the movie business, a studio would give these two cash for a clunker of their own.

The comedy concept is solid: Jeremy Piven plays a hard-driving used-car salesman  not such a stretch, right?  brought in with his freelance team to save a failing small-town dealership. It's the execution that's out of alignment in The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard , a slightly dinged endeavor from the makers of Talladega Nights : Barely controlled scenes of genial, scattershot political incorrectness (sexual, racial, you name it) bump up awkwardly against a soft, sad story of economic downturn. Ed Helms and Ving Rhames score laughs. But the breakout is Step Brothers ' Kathryn Hahn as the tough (sales)girl who keeps up with the boys.


 At one point during “The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard,” a grubby-looking comedy about the art of the sale, two alligators crawl across a car lot. Who brought the alligators? a bewildered man asks. We’re the only ones who can hear his question amid the shrieks of the customers and salesmen and the whir of a buzz saw that brings a guy on stilts and in an Uncle Sam costume down to size. From one angle this frenzied moment looks like a metaphor for the American auto industry, but it’s just a throwaway in a comedy without a shred of obvious filmmaking and an endless stream of good, bad, sometimes terrible, often absurd jokes.  The alligators make no sense, which is part of why the sight gag works. (They also look inherently funny, especially when crawling among a crazed mob.) So, who brought them? The filmmakers, of course, who, as they do with everything else in this movie, throw the bit against the wall but don’t wait to see if it sticks. Instead they race to the next joke and the one after that, busily tossing one-liners, surreal asides, cheap and gross insults, false apologies for such insults, semi-naked ladies, sex toys and multisyllabic expletives like confetti. Unlike the errant tiger in “The Hangover,” which is only truly funny because it belongs to Mike Tyson, which also makes it somewhat tragic, the alligators are a genuinely madcap touch.  Neal Brennan, an alumnus of “Chappelle’s Show” making his big-screen directing debut, could use better technical support and some alone time with a box of Jerry Lewis DVDs, but it takes talent to keep so many parts in play and without much letup. Anarchy and its threat are the twin engines of many comedies, though it must be said that the anarchy here doesn’t always feel particularly planned. There’s a jerry-built feel to the movie, as if it had been hatched by the screenwriters Andy Stock and Rick Stempson over a long caffeine-addled weekend and shot while its star, Jeremy Piven, had a few hours to spare between  HBO and Broadway. You keep waiting for the whole thing to collapse, but that’s also part of the fun.  The story doesn’t matter  — this is a movie about the pitch, not the goods  —  but for form’s sake: Mr. Piven, his shuddering uvula and three sidekicks (David Koechner, Kathryn Hahn and Ving Rhames), play car salespeople who cross the country moving wheels off slow lots by yelling and waving the red, white and blue in exchange for wads of green. James Brolin plays a lot owner who hires this itinerant sales force. And Jordana Spiro, Rob Riggle, Ed Helms, Wendie Malick, Craig Robinson, Tony Hale and other funny people play the attendant crazies. Mr. Piven basically shouts a lot while pumping his limbs with the same tight gestures that are familiar from his showboating as Ari Gold on “Entourage.” He’s funny there, he’s funny here.  Will Ferrell, who, with his frequent director Adam McKay, served as  a producer on the movie, shows up in mutton chops.  “The Goods: Live Hard, Sell Hard” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.) The film has dirty, nasty jokes galore and two pretty special lap-dancing routines.

Jeremy Piven's much-admired performance as a live-wire agent in "Entourage" gets a grueling road test in "The Goods: Live Hard * Sell Hard," inasmuch as he plays virtually the same motor-mouthed character for a duration equivalent to three teeth-grinding episodes. A project about selling used cars invites abuse, but the movie indeed runs out of gas, squandering a wealth of comedy talent mostly associated with television. Barely mustering enough crude humor for one trailer, "The Goods" continues a "lost" (as in "Land of the") summer for Will Ferrell's producing endeavors; Paramount doesn't figure to yield much cash from this clunker.
The premise proves so wispy that director Neal Brennan ("Chappelle's Show") has to rely on several musical montages to pad the story to feature length. The sputtering plot focuses on Don Ready (Piven) and his trio of "mercenary" car salesmen, enlisted to save a struggling franchise in the nondescript California town of Temecula.
The dealership is owned by stately ol' Ben Selleck (James Brolin), who spends most of the movie propositioning Don's balding sidekick, Brent (David Koechner). In fact, the whole Selleck family quickly finds itself in strange liaisons with Don's ne'er-do-wells: Don flirts with Ben's engaged daughter, Ivy (Jordana Spiro, "My Boys"), while the one gal in Don's quartet, Babs (Kathryn Hahn), fixates on Ben's son (Rob Riggle), a man-sized 10-year-old thanks to a pituitary condition.
And so it goes. Ving Rhames rounds out Don's posse, getting some laughs simply because of the low rumble in his voice. Ivy has an odious fiance (Ed Helms, in what surely won't
 be his highest-grossing comedy of 2009) who, with his import-selling dad (Alan Thicke), wants to take over Selleck's business. Bankruptcy looms unless Don can move all 211 cars off the lot in one weekend. Or something like that.
Earning its R rating for salty language ("mother" is frequently invoked, but almost always with a tart chaser), the movie inadvertently telegraphs its strategic approach near the outset, when Don tells the standoffish Ivy that he's "just gonna keep firing 'til I hit something."
As much could be said for Brennan, who betrays his sketch-comedy roots working from a scattershot script by Andy Stock and Rick Stempson. Yet despite the cast's gameness and a few uncredited cameos, funny people saying filthy things only goes so far. And even playing with obvious cliches, the let's-save-(closeted)-dad's-dealership motif feels like the flimsiest of excuses to allow Piven to chew through the drab scenery. Frankly, the movie gets its best comedic mileage from character actor Charles Napier as a bigoted, easily riled war vet.
Of course, seeing cars sell like hotcakes, given the auto industry's well-publicized woes, represents its own kind of dark joke, but a movie that spends half its time in strip clubs because, what the hell, we've got an R already for dialogue, can't really be expected to indulge in social commentary.
At least "The Goods" knows precisely what its mission is. But unlike Don's can-do attitude, the movie simply doesn't deliver -- living hard, selling hard and, before it's over, finally dying hard.
