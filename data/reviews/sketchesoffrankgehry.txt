A mutual admiration society comes to order in Sketches of Frank Gehry  when, mini-DV camera in hand,  famous filmmaker Sydney Pollack circles around his friend, the equally famous architect of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and favorite of entertainment celebrities who want him to design their houses; Gehry sketches and free-associates about how he's not nearly the menschy aw-shucks pussycat from Canada he appears to be but rather a wily, complicated L.A. lion. Meanwhile, another camera circles around the famous filmmaker. And danged if the seductive documentary  Pollack's first  doesn't come to resemble a Gehry building itself, all brash, eye-catching, a tad vain, and attractively neurotic.

 One of the hardest places for a movie — or anything else — to go is into the mind of an artist. You can point the camera at the work that is the tangible product of how that mind operates, and you can record interviews that try to explain and interpret, but the creative process remains a durable mystery.  "Sketches of Frank Gehry" respects the essential enigma of its subject even as it illuminates his ways of thinking about form, space and construction. As its title suggests, this absorbing documentary, the first directed by Sydney Pollack ("Out of Africa," "The Way We Were" and so on), is a modest undertaking, offering glimpses of the architect and his work rather than a full-scale portrait or catalogue raisonné.  This approach seems apt, since Mr. Gehry's buildings, with their folded surfaces and off-center interiors, are impossible to take in head-on, all at once. They originate as doodles on paper and assemblages of cardboard and tape, eventually (when everything works out) achieving their final incarnation in glass and titanium, and it is fascinating to watch this metamorphosis take place.  Mr. Pollack visits most of the important Gehry landmarks,  from the Walt Disney Concert Hall to the Bilbao Guggenheim, as well as early residences and a hockey rink that Mr. Gehry, a native of Canada, built for the Anaheim Mighty Ducks of the N.H.L. In addition to Mr. Gehry and his associates, the filmmaker interviews patrons, admirers and friends, including the former Disney executives Michael D. Eisner and Michael S. Ovitz, the Guggenheim chief Thomas Krens and Herbert Muschamp, the former architecture critic of The New York Times.    At times "Sketches" seems to veer toward the genre of celebrity-talking-head mutual-appreciation documentary, in which famous people talk about other famous people, engaging in a form of tasteful, tactful log-rolling. Not all of the testimony here is especially expert — no disrespect to Bob Geldof, who tells us about how he once rode past a Gehry building on a bus in Germany — though almost all of it is complimentary.  The token detractor is Hal Foster, an art critic and Princeton professor, who accepts the role with evident weariness, and is in any case more critical of Mr. Gehry's reputation, and of the kind of cultural branding his fame represents, than of his work per se. More interesting are conversations with Ed Ruscha and Chuck Arnoldi, California artists with whom Mr. Gehry was associated when much of the architectural establishment was ignoring him, and with Dr. Milton Wexler, the therapist who has treated Mr. Gehry for decades and who has to turn away patients who believe he can make them world-class architects too.  But what keeps the film going is the rapport between filmmaker and subject, who see themselves as kindred spirits and who have been friends for years. At first glance this may seem like an implausible notion — at least I can think of no critical formula that would establish an analogy between "Tootsie" and the Bilbao Guggenheim — but after a while the terms of their affinity become clear.  As both men have occasion to remark, what unites them is the necessity of achieving a measure of creative freedom in a field usually defined by commercial concerns and controlled by other people's money. At least on the evidence of "Sketches," Mr. Gehry has a lot of satisfied customers, including one whose house, after years of work and millions of dollars, was never built.  Mr. Pollack, kibitzing around the architect's offices with a handheld camera, is not the kind of cinéma vérité wallflower who would keep himself studiously out of the picture. He and Mr. Gehry, in spite of their long careers and numerous accomplishments, share traces of a rough-edged outsider's sensibility. Affable as he is in conversation, Mr. Gehry also clearly has a combative, prickly side, which he mentions more than he demonstrates.  And this movie, for its part, balances exploration of his personality with admiration of his work. Mr. Pollack, an appreciative amateur, is an able tour guide who uses his trained eye to generate insights when talk runs dry.  At one point Mr. Gehry expresses his envy for painters, and laments his inability to achieve the visual effects that they can. "Yeah, right," Mr. Pollack says, cutting to a quick, eloquent montage of some of his friend's buildings, their surfaces exquisitely reflecting sunlight, absorbing rain and lifting their surroundings into the realm of art.

Lucid and engaging, "Sketches of Frank Gehry" provides the enormously gratifying opportunity to spend an hour-and-a-half with an artistic giant. Sydney Pollack, in his first stab at docu filmmaking, takes advantage of his long friendship with the celebrated architect to sculpt an incisive portrait that trains a keen eye on what inspires and enables the subject to do what he does, just as Pollack's entertainer's instinct ensures the presence of strong doses of humanity and humor. Set for PBS airings on the American Masters series next fall, pic is intelligently rewarding in a way that would appeal to upscale specialized theatrical auds. Eventual DVD market will be big.
Disingenuously or not, Pollack assumes a know-nothing layman's perspective about architecture to provide a "Frank Gehry for Beginners"-like entree to his illustrious subject, most famous for his radical and breathtaking Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, and the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. In fact, the first time we see Gehry at work in his studio, he and an associate are cutting out odd-shaped pieces of paper with scissors and bending them into different shapes, much as children might do in a kindergarten art class.
Thus disarmed into accepting Gehry as a plain-spoken regular guy, the viewer is taken on a rich tour of his artistic world and the journey that brought him to where he is today.
With Pollack himself often on view interrogating his friend with his own hand-held camera, Gehry is induced to reflect on his life and work in his striking home, visiting the Disney Hall construction site, riding around Los Angeles and elsewhere.
Aside from a handwriting expert who early on predicted Gehry would become a great architect, the beginnings were not auspicious. He failed a perspective class at USC, and in 1954 was persuaded to change his name from Goldberg. He hung out with artists, for years worked mostly on private residences in Southern California and as late as 1984 designed a structure as mundanely anonymous as the Santa Monica Place Mall.
The first building of "the new type," involving sweeping irregular curves, unusual materials and an acute sensitivity to the effect of light on a structure, was the Vitra Furniture Museum in Germany, finished in 1989. What led to this breakthrough, among other things, was analysis. With as much levity as insight, Gehry and his therapist of 35 years, Milton Wexler, note how Gehry had to emerge from a period of feeling "bankrupt" to achieve the boldness to reach his full potential, a process that involved leaving his first wife.
Wexler laughs that his successful treatment of Gehry caused countless less talented architects to come to him in hopes of making similar breakthroughs; if it were only that simple.
Gehry allows that the quality of a project depends to a great extent upon the quality of the client, and along the way Pollack introduces eminent clients (Michael Eisner, Dennis Hopper, Barry Diller), artist friends (Ed Ruscha, Julian Schnabel), architects (the late Philip Johnson) and even critics with less-than-flattering things to say.
The architect's work-process, although undoubtedly simplified, is neatly laid out. While Gehry still acknowledges his fear of the proverbial blank page, for him "the first move" generally consists of elegant pen-and-ink doodles of shapes, followed by cut-outs that are bent and taped together. Gehry insists that, "Everything has been done before, and the only thing that changes is technology," and while he can't operate a computer himself, he admits that 3-D computer modeling has enabled him to push his ideas much further.
Taking the discussion to a grander level is, of all people, Bob Geldof, who gripes that, "Architects have a lot to answer for." Gehry's work, at its best, stands as an example of how a single building can transform and elevate a neighborhood, even an entire city. The mayor of Bilbao testifies as to how the community's self-esteem, not to mention its tourism, has been enormously bolstered by the Guggenheim Museum, and Los Angeles residents are familiar with the transformative quality of Disney Hall.
At one point, Gehry acknowledges Pollack for having shown him by example a way to work in the commercial world, by finding a "sliver" of a point where an artist can express himself in a giant undertaking on which many parties must be satisfied. The men find rueful agreement that, on big projects that are often years in the making, they no longer like them by the time they're finished.
Quite apart from the privileged access to Gehry himself, the film offers superbly photographed impressions of the buildings; Bilbao, in particular, is shown from many different perspectives.
If Pollack has more world-class artist friends, he's bound to be hearing from them soon with requests to make films about them, based on the way he presents Gehry here.

Insider journalism several times over, this enjoyably breezy portrait of genius architect Frank Gehry  is drawn doodle-style by first-time documentarian Sydney Pollack , a Hollywood  player with ready access to impartial testimony from patron saint moguls (Diller, Eisner, Ovitz) and a close friend of the subject for 30 years. Narrating in the first person, Pollack claims identification not only with the architect's artistic anxiety ("avoidance, delay, denial"), but with his challenge to achieve personal expression despite commercial restraints (i.e., the monumental Guggenheim in Bilbao  is Gehry's The Way We Were , the Santa Monica Place Mall  his Havana  , Sabrina , Electric Horseman, Random Hearts , et al.). The friends tread lightly on one another's soft spots, including the source of Gehry's 1950s name change from Goldberg, and the admiration becomes infectious in the visual exploration of Gehry's perverse body of work, whose curves and crevices Pollack's camera seems to caress like a lover. The sensual mood seems to turn even talking heads into construction sites while both men appear as endearingly malleable structures: Gehry as the cubist hockey fan, alternately arrogant and shy, bossy and passive; Pollack as equally privileged and ordinary, neurotic and gregarious.
