It's been seven years since husband-and-wife adventurers Rick and Evelyn O'Connell (Fraser, playing Indy, and Bello, playing Rachel Weisz, poorly) last kicked off the wrappings of undead Egyptian Imhotep, and by golly, they are one bone-bored couple. While their now-grown offspring, Alex (Ford), is off in China desecrating the tomb of the Dragon Emperor (Li), they're trapped in their oversized English country estate, victims of their own success. No more mummies (they rekilled what felt like a thousand of the creaky things in 2001's The Mummy Returns
) means no more gallivanting around the globe. Reduced to sharing "yet another lovely night in" and dining at a table of Arthurian proportions (if not circumference), they can be excused for going all giddy when Her Majesty requests of them one final mission: Safeguard the passage of a sacred 400-carat diamond to Shanghai. Easy as pie, you'd think, but as Evy's brother Jonathan (series regular Hannah) notes, the O'Connells are "mummy magnets." He's right, too. Before you can say, "Hey, didn't Universal Home Video just release the vastly superior 1932 original as part of its excellent bells-whistles-and-tannis-leaves Universal Legacy Series?" the O'Connell family is up to its neck in ambulatory terra-cotta warriors, a mother-and-daughter pair of immortal Chinese tomb guardians (Yeoh, Leong), and Li's reanimated Dragon Emperor. It's a confused mess of a film, however, no more so than when the emperor morphs into what amounts to an outright plagiarism of Toho's triple-headed King Ghidorah (from Godzilla vs. Monster Zero
, et al.), complete with virtually identical sound effects. It's abundantly clear that this is one franchise that is dead in all but name. Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
 is little more than a cluttered, noisy, and unsatisfying thrill ride to nowhere, so masturbatory in its quest for action-comedy box office that it becomes an almost literal case of, dare I say, spanking the mummy. Forget this bloated misfire, and instead, hit the video store and get off on Karloff in the privacy of your own tomb.


"Do the words 'Rest in Peace' mean anything to you people?" asks someone during the course of "The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor." Apparently not. Nine years after the first big-budget action "Mummy" and seven years after its follow-up comes this jokey, frenetic, overproduced three-quel. Despite plenty of post-"Pirates of the Caribbean" zombie mayhem, it's strictly for kids. And for Brendan Fraser's bank account.
The star is just about the only person left from the 1999 original, but his dudacious charm is wearing thin as adventurer Rick O'Connell once more steps into the breach of the undead. Egypt having been plundered in previous installments, the action moves to China, where the ancient kill-crazy Emperor Han (Jet Li) has been dug up along with his terra-cotta army.
Arrayed against him are Rick, his wife, Evelyn (Maria Bello takes over for Rachel Weisz, wielding a simply teddible British accent), their college-age junior explorer son Alex (Luke Ford), Evelyn's nervous-nellie brother Jonathan (John Hannah), a beautiful 2,000-year-old witch (Michelle Yeoh), and her daughter (Isabella Leong). Needing to drink from the pool of eternal youth, the villain leads them all to Shangri-La high up in the Himalayas.
Better they should have looked on the Universal back lot, since Fraser and Bello seem ridiculously young to be Ford's parents. The script's limp intergenerational arguments come off as sibling rivalry.
Despite exotic locations, epic cinematography, and much spectacular crash and bang, this "Mummy" feels like a threadbare toss-off. Director Rob Cohen ("xXx," "Stealth") keeps things moving and that's about it; the script by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar stoops to such kiddie-film silliness as an airsick yak, and Yetis who kick field goals.
That's right, the Abominable Snowman and friends put in an appearance, the only time the film threatens to become entertainingly daft. The rest is prodigious big-budget waste, expertly crafted, and instantly forgettable. The sense of missed opportunity extends to the presence of Jet Li, who, despite some poorly shot fight scenes, mostly stands around snarling in rotting-clay makeup.
Why hire one of the great stars of Hong Kong martial arts movies and give him nothing to do? Maybe they can solve that mystery in the next sequel. It should feature Brendan Fraser beating a mummified horse.


Brendan Fraser , with his boyish face and trademark hair flop, hasn't exactly entered the Harrison Ford grumpy-old-man zone, so it's discombobulating to learn that in The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor , Fraser's eager daredevil archaeologist has been given an eager daredevil archaeologist son, played by Luke Ford (no relation). Fraser, who at 39 looks perhaps five years older than this kid, needed a wholesome offspring-sidekick like a third arm. Then again, it's not clear that the world needed a third Mummy  movie. Director Rob Cohen spends deadening stretches on the backstory, as if under the delusion it's just as important as the mad creepy-crawlies rising out of the sand. Wrong! In a Mummy  movie, I want my eyes tickled out of their sockets by frenzied digital overkill and couldn't give less of a hoot about the mummy's ''motivation.''
In this one, he's an evil Chinese emperor who rises up, in the person of Jet Li , as a crumbling oxidized metal ghost whose face keeps chipping off. Fairly cool! After an hour of inert exposition, a race through Shanghai gooses the movie alive. Then it plunges back into torpor, and then, at last, it offers a desert battle of skeletons and rusty soldiers worthy of the sound and fury and utter meaninglessness we want from an orgy of pixels.

 The “Mummy” franchise has always been the B-movie version of the “Indiana Jones” films, which themselves are B movies elevated by Steven Spielberg into an action-adventure colossus. So what does that make  the “Mummy” films in the grand scheme of things? C movies?  The third installment, “Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,” directed by Rob Cohen (“XXX,” “The Fast and the Furious”), is by far the weakest. In it the excitement-starved husband-and-wife exploring team, Rick and Evelyn O’Connell (Brendan Fraser and Maria Bello, who replaces Rachel Weisz), come out of retirement in 1946 to travel to Shanghai, where they are tricked into helping resurrect an evil 2,000-year-old emperor (Jet Li). The emperor’s schemes to become immortal all those years ago were foiled when a benign sorceress (Michelle Yeoh) laid a curse on him. While in Shanghai,  Rick and Evelyn run into their mischievous college dropout son, Alex (the  charmless Luke Ford).  When the curse is accidentally lifted, the emperor,  joined by a rebel Chinese army, rushes to the Himalayas, where a dip in a pool in Shangri-La promises immortality. He already has supernatural powers and likes to turn himself into a three-headed dragon. Accompanying the O’Connells is Evelyn’s eccentric, wisecracking brother Jonathan (John Hannah), who during the flight to the mountains is vomited on by a yak.  The kindest thing to be said for this frantic, cluttered mess of cheesy computer-generated action-adventure clichés is that at least you can see how the estimated $175 million budget (according to the Internet Movie Database) was spent. We get an avalanche, an army of bow-and-arrow-wielding skeletons, a car chase that turns into a fireworks explosion, and a cadre of snowy yetis. In  the movie’s futile drive to conjure visceral excitement, the action sequences are edited into an incoherent jumble that makes you feel trapped on a rickety airplane sitting in a pool of yak vomit.  “The  Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and mild violence.

Given the must, dust and rust emanating from this third installment, it's clear the time has come for this "Mummy" franchise to be truly mummified once and for all. Set in a post-WWII context and giving the hero a cocky college-age son in a way that tiresomely mirrors the recent "Indiana Jones" revival, new entry has a fresh marketing angle in the Chinese setting that will boost biz, especially in Asia, beyond the built-in worldwide audience that paid more than $800 million to see the first two Brendan Fraser starrers. But as the film comes off as both old hat and low-grade, this will stand as an interesting test of whether seven years rep too long a wait to sustain public interest in a once-popular concept.
Aside from some of the visual effects, which at their best involve 10,000 Terracotta warriors coming to life after 2,000 years, this is cheeseball stuff all the way. As they say, it starts with the script, and this one, by "Shanghai Noon" and "Smallville" scribes Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, should have been found wanting early on, especially in the woeful family-issues dialogue that periodically brings the otherwise lumbering adventure tale to a complete halt.
Last seen battling the Rock's Scorpion King in Egypt circa 1933, Fraser's Rick O'Connell, having helped lick the Nazis, is reintroduced here in 1946, getting used to domesticity in a sumptuous English mansion while his wife Evelyn (Maria Bello, stepping into the role vacated by Rachel Weisz) looks for inspiration for another entry in her potboiler "Mummy" novel series. Rick insists he's retired from archeology and exploring, but perhaps he doth protest too much, as it takes little convincing to get him and Evelyn to decamp for Shanghai, where they quickly encounter Evelyn's nightclubbing brother (John Hannah, returning) and their devil-may-care son Alex (Luke Ford).
Alex has inherited his parents' heedless sense of derring-do and good luck, as he has recently stumbled upon the long-sought tomb of the Dragon Emperor and the chambers housing his massive army, all preserved under the Chinese desert. An action-powered prologue reveals how, back in 50 B.C., the ruthless, nation-unifying Emperor (Jet Li) betrayed a witch (Michelle Yeoh) who had agreed to endow him with immortality, and who repaid him by sending him into an unending state of limbo between life and death.
With the help of a duplicitous contempo general (of unspecified political affiliation in 1946 China), who hopes to ride the legendary emperor's coattails to power, the crusty-looking old monarch heads to Shanghai and then to Shangri-La itself -- all the while doing battle, in various human and inhuman forms, with the O'Connell mob, which grows to include the witch, a foxy mystery woman (Isabella Leong), and an old coot pilot to spirit the gang into the Himalayas.
All the elements are present: a rare elixir, a secret stone, the toxic seductions of old Shanghai, a villain who can only be killed in one special way, the brash and sometimes bumbling Americans, the mummy who seethes with centuries of resentment and can morph into other creatures. But reheating the ingredients can't disguise how stale they are, as setpiece after setpiece strains to whip up excitement, only to fall flat while reminding of previous sequences that did such things ever so much better.
Although he's pulled off adrenaline-fueled features before, notably "The Fast and the Furious," director Rob Cohen flubs his opportunities here by shooting most of the action in medium closeups and cutting with manic arbitrariness. Coverage provides scant sense of geography or proximity between characters, while offering no excitement or suspense in the bargain. By any nominal standard for staging screen action, it's incoherent more often than not.
Rather too relaxed in the early going, Fraser only intermittently finds his old groove, as he's forced to share the spotlight with an overabundance of co-stars; as the lynchpin of the franchise, he should have exercised a measure of droit de seigneur
 by demanding a rewrite giving him more action and better lines. The very contempo-seeming Bello is an odd fit here, adopting a high-toned Brit accent and well out of her comfort zone when asked to lurch into battle. Ford, as Alex, is generally annoying, and only further performances by the Aussie newcomer will tell whether the blame lies with the actor or the role.
Asian thesps are highly confined by costumes and character conception, with Yeoh having the most opportunities as the fortune-dealing witch. Li only really appears in recognizably human form at the beginning and end, as the Emperor takes partially mummified CG form through most of the picture.
Production values are massive, ranging from a large Shanghai-streets soundstage set to, more impressively, the sandy wastes that serve as the setting for the climactic battle. End credits are truly endless, listing everything down to hair department interpreter.
If there is to be a fourth "Mummy," perish the thought, internal indications are that it would be set in Peru.

Best not to inquire too deeply into this Mummy : Where Sommers chose cheerful extravagance, Cohen's enterprise is joylessly efficient, pushing the family around from one locale to the nextinevitably too late to stop whatever it is they were there for in the first placeuntil the final confrontation. It's weird (and unflattering) to see this thoroughly unnecessary sequel/Indiana Jones  rip-off the same summer as Spielberg's own Indiana Jones extension. (And it's downright insulting that the film dramatizes its own lack of inspiration through wisecracks about how Evelyn owes her publisher one more installment.)
Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull  (is that really  a worse title?) got a freakishly hostile reception, but even Spielberg's half-assed effort trumps this. His chases are crisp and funny, while Cohens are incoherent and dull. Indy 's family dynamics are refreshingly tossed-off; Dragon Emperor  spells out its familial trauma/reconciliation with lines like "Thanks for believing in me." The would-be banter is distressingly rote: John Hannah  returns for another round as Evelyn's brother Jonathan (doesnt he  at least he recognize that someones stolen Weiszs identity?) and gets rewarded with lines like "My ass is on fire! Spank my ass!"
Then theres Lipointlessly cast, unless you're coming from a marketing perspective, in which case the film should now appeal to easily pleased fans of mummies and  martial arts. Li spends most of his time transforming into various beasties (one of the dragon emperor's powers), and when he finally does get to fight Fraser...well, I don't care how old Li is, there's no way  he's going to get beat in hand-to-hand combat by Dudley Do-Right . At least Li gets to bark his dialogue in Chinese; in apparent deference to American sensibilities, Yeoh, whos given even less fighting time, is forced to sputter out her awful lines in English. (Having been cooped up in a cave for 2,000 years, I guess Yeoh spent immortality learning a second language.)
Strange how dreary it all is, and how tired Fraser seems. In a summer where even conservative blockbusters like Iron Man  managed a few personal touches, Dragon Emperor  is far less than spectacular and never more than noisy. Any and all props must be assigned solely to the various CGI teams: Though hardly convincing, their three-headed dragon and army of helpful Yeti warriors (!) are easily the highlights of a Mummy  low point.
