Richard Donner still has it. 16 Blocks
 may be a formulaic good-cops/bad-cops actioner, but it�s rarely stereotypical. In another director�s hands, this yarn about a battle fatigued NYPD detective (Willis, looking like the shady underside of his long-ago Moonlighting
 character) and the petty criminal (Mos Def) who inadvertently turns his life into a living hell might have come off laughably awful. But Donner, whose Lethal Weapon
 still resonates (not to mention The Goonies
 and the vastly underrated Radio Flyer
), pulls it off with flair and zing, returning to the ever-more-gritty world of duplicitous peace officers and the demons that straddle them. When we first see Willis� Det. Jack Mosley, he already looks three breaths away from six feet under. With slicked-back hair on the way out, a gimpy leg, and a meandering shuffle, he moves across the screen with the tortuously implacable gait of Universal�s Frankenstein monster, and you think, �It�s not alive!� But it is, barely, thanks to hourly injections not of lightning, but of scotch, bourbon, and what have you. At the end an overnight shift, he�s harangued into some hopefully quick overtime ferrying motormouth felon Eddie Bunker (a tip of the hat to Reservoir Dogs
� real-life con-turned-actor Edward Bunker, who died last year) a mere 16 blocks to his court date. As anyone who�s ever been in Manhattan can tell you, however, 16 blocks in NYC do not necessarily correspond with any distance measurable in the rest of the world. When Mosley stops off at a Korean package store for an early-morning pick-me-up, he returns just in time to foil an assassin�s attempt on Bunker, who, locked in the back seat, has been going over his plans to open a bakery in Seattle once he�s out of the system. As Mosley�s perpetually bad luck would have it, Bunker is slated to testify against a number of high-ranking NYPD police personnel in a case that could very well bring down an entire precinct. To the boys in blue, he�s worth much, much more dead than alive. And so begins Jack and Eddie�s circuitous, hair-raising sprint, dash, and dive through tenement houses and over rooftops, past dirty cops and even up against Mosley�s ex-partner of 20 years (Morse, no stranger to cop roles, but here playing against type). Donner, working from a script by Richard Wenk, has fashioned an economical cops-and-robbers vehicle that moves with all the predictability of a spoonful of mercury. Despite some disorderly backstory � an explanation for Mosley�s death�s head demeanor is offered, although it feels a tad forced and arrives far too late in the film � 16 Blocks
 keeps tossing out unlikely but wholly believable (in the context of the film, that is) tidbits of information about Mosley, until, by the final reel, we have a relatively complete picture of one good cop�s fall from grace � and further, which is mirrored by the arching upswing of the almost comically chatty Eddie. Mos Def, to his credit, holds his own against Willis, no small feat that. It�s still just cops and robbers, but with Donner at the helm, it feels like so much more.


Jack Mosley, the NYPD detective Bruce Willis plays in "16 Blocks," is a mess. He's jowly, tubby, grizzled, and exhausted. He has a drunk's complexion (pasty and ruddy at the same time), walks with a limp, and wears a weaselly mustache. After working an all-nighter, Jack is commanded to pick up a convict and drive him to a courthouse, where the con is supposed to play star witness and give up the names of crooked cops at a splashy trial.
Jack doesn't look like he could drive a Big Wheel, let alone efficiently outrun, outthink, and outshoot the pack of coldblooded cops eager to kill the witness before he testifies. But Willis is a pro. He's been here before, and, man, so have we.
"16 Blocks" is a chase drama with a fraying imagination. You watch it thoroughly convinced that Willis has been drunk and hung over for years. Mos Def is quite good, as usual, playing Eddie, Jack's whining charge, like Jerry Lewis on a sedative.
It's the rest of the picture that defies credibility. It's unbelievably bland.
There are foot chases through Chinatown's streets, restaurants, and tenements. And lots of expository conversations among Jack, Eddie, and Frank (David Morse), a detective who is Jack's pal. This all builds to Jack's commandeering a city bus, holding the passengers hostage, then finding a ridiculous way to drive it down the narrowest alleys. This goes down on an allegedly sweltering day, but the movie doesn't make us feel the heat.
The director of "16 Blocks" is Richard Donner, who, after directing "The Omen," the original "Superman" movie, and the entire "Lethal Weapon" series, among other Hollywood hits, seems to have been laid low by mediocrity. In the movie's press information, Donner says he took one look at Richard Wenk's script and exclaimed, "I have to direct this
!" (The italics are his; the exclamation point is mine.)
Donner's enthusiasm is understandable. His previous picture was "Timeline," an execrable science-fiction adventure that trapped us in 14th-century France with 21st-century nincompoops.
"16 Blocks" is a kinder, more competent, slightly less forgettable experience. The plot just feels 30 years old, like one for a movie 75-year-old Donner might have tried in his prolific prime. His action direction is still fleet: lots of handheld camerawork and plenty of virile shootouts and crashed-up property. Which is to say, the film is admirably old-fashioned, motivated more by dialogue and character than by a sheer appetite for destruction. In fact, great heterosexual tenderness blooms as Jack and Eddie fall into a big puddle of mutual admiration.
Nobody says so, but "16 Blocks" feels like a remake of Clint Eastwood's "The Gauntlet," in which Eastwood tried to transport hooker Sondra Locke from Las Vegas to Phoenix to testify at a mob trial. (Eastwood even commandeers a bus.) "The Gauntlet" was exciting nonsense. "16 Blocks" is just dutiful, until all the duty crowds out any fun.

         The 1980s action movie genre often blurred the good guy-bad guy paradigm with flawed protagonists who overcame tumultuous pasts to ultimately do the right thing and vanquish whatever evil lay in their path, especially when the conflict became personal. Overtly nihilistic or workaholic types such as Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson in "Lethal Weapon") and John McClane (Bruce Willis in "Die Hard") cut loose their inner demons to fire off some heavy artillery and pump the real villains full of lead.
 
  Nearly two decades later, director Richard Donner (a veteran of all four "Lethal Weapon" films) teams with Willis for "16 Blocks," a denuded version of an '80s action film, one that replaces firepower with 1970s grit and drama.
 


         






    A ticking clock scenario and a terrific performance by Willis as an alcoholic NYPD detective make up for the film's occasional missteps and some strange pop culture references.
 
  Det. Jack Mosley is a perpetually hung-over burnout who is literally on his last legs as a cop, reduced to doing menial duties such as baby-sitting crime scenes.
 
  Gray as a ghost, Willis plays the world-weary Mosley like a man who has been dipped in concrete and is waiting for someone to dump him in the river. This is the worn-out edition of the '80s action hero, 20 years older and a whole lot slower.
 
  At the tail end of an overnight shift, Jack's lieutenant catches him on the way out and asks him to transport a petty criminal named Eddie Bunker (Mos Def) the titular distance from the precinct to the courthouse.
 
  It's 8:02 a.m., and Bunker needs be in court by 10. The almost real-time drama efficiently makes use of the tension implied by the setup, and Donner deftly moves the action along at a pace that balances thrills and respites.
 
  Eddie is a motormouth who proves grating to Jack even before they get into the car. Mos Def, the rapper and musician who has built a solid acting résumé on stage and in TV and theatrical films, is extremely compelling in the role but is saddled with an odd Bugs Bunny way of speaking that wears thin quickly. Donner and screenwriter Richard Wenk use the character as comic relief much the same way Joe Pesci was deployed in the later "Lethal Weapons" and almost as annoyingly.
 
  Out of the precinct, Mosley and Eddie aren't on the road two minutes, stuck in morning gridlock, when Jack decides to quench his thirst and stop at a liquor store, where he's on a first-name basis with the proprietors. He returns to the car just in time to foil a hit on Eddie, and the mismatched duo takes off on foot hunted by a phalanx of cops, led by Jack's ex-partner, Frank Nugent (David Morse), who want to ensure that Eddie doesn't live to testify against one of their own.
 
  Combining footage shot in Toronto and New York, Donner creates a reasonably convincing sense of Manhattan as Mosley and Eddie thread their way through the labyrinthine streets of Chinatown eluding their pursuers. Though one scene would seem to confirm the urban myth that all the area's Chinese restaurants utilize one giant subterranean kitchen — complete with a laundry — the film's street scenes are steeped in stark realism.
 
  Willis and Mos Def's chemistry allows the movie to work on the level of a buddy picture with Jack's cynicism no match for Eddie's belief that anybody is capable of changing. But the relationship also provides a foundation for the meatier theme of redemption, and the film's depiction of a defeated man summoning the moral courage to address his past is, satisfyingly, more '70s than '80s.   

Bruce Willis makes a shocking entrance in 16 Blocks , a thick, juicy steak of a crime-cop-conscience action thriller in the tasty tradition of Prince of the City  and a hundred episodes of NYPD Blue . And all he does is walk down a hall. Willis plays Jack Mosley, an NYPD detective gone to seed  to rot, really. Jack's got a potbelly, a bad leg, and the ashy pallor of the working drunk he is; in decrepit middle age, he's a clock-in, clock-out lifer whose pickled deadwoodiness is company-wide knowledge. Yet the actor eases us into Jack's rotting universe so skillfully  so thoroughly at home with a fat gut, a gray mustache, and a permanent expression of disillusioned sourness, so authentically and without pride-in-prosthetics  that at first I thought, jeez, what happened to Willis, for real?
What happened is that old Lethal Weapon  precinct vet Richard Donner got together with the erstwhile John McClane of Die Hard , both sank their teeth into a meaty script by relative newcomer Richard Wenk that simmers and boils in real time, and the collaboration has done both director and star a world of good as they freshen up in a well-worn milieu. In 16 Blocks , Jack's rinky-dink assignment on a stifling hot NYC summer morning, grudgingly accepted, is a babysitting chore: He's got to drive Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), a measly, chattering twerp of a petty criminal, the title distance from lockup to courthouse where Eddie is to testify to a grand jury. (A trained New Yorker can make the hike, less than a mile, in 15 minutes, easy.)
Of course, traversing 16 Blocks  takes considerably longer. Traffic, Jack's stop at a liquor store, and exquisite bad luck put Eddie in the crosshairs of a would-be assassin, and Jack's split-second cop's instinct to intervene only makes the muck deeper: The backup that arrives includes Jack's old brother in shady blue, homicide detective Frank Nugent (David Morse), and it soon becomes clear that the guys who wanted Eddie dead to prevent his testimony are themselves cops  cops as dirty as they come. Is Jack on the side of the force or the punk? (Turning the chewing of gum into a gesture of menace, Morse shows once again how a guy can morph from St. Elsewhere 's Dr. Sensitive into one of our most interesting character actors, his pleasant, boyish face now fattened into something much less predictable.)
The race is on. The movie throws in sequences of Donnerian red-blooded action  there's some Speed -inspired business involving a city bus, and the production makes use of the proximity of New York's Chinatown to its courthouses for some sharp sequences involving cat-and-mouse chases through atmospheric subterranean kitchens and laundries. But the most exciting moments unfold in stillness, while Jack and Eddie are paused between perils, and Def  electric as a punk with a criminal past and dreams of a future as a professional cake baker  engages Willis with the seriousness of his patter. Mouthiness from a black man is often used as comic relief in a black-and-white duo, but Def's Eddie is never foolish. And in grateful response, Willis' Jack is never glib.
Besides, the two characters have the luxury of real, reflective time to fill, something so rare in an age of zip-bang-crash-zap action-pic editing as to be classified as ''old-fashioned.'' A helluva lot happens in 16 Blocks   an outrageous amount, really, along with a coda that deposits the audience squarely (and I do mean squarely) at a movieland finale. Who knew that looking both ways before crossing is where the real action is?

 For the first adrenaline-spiked hour of his new action flick "16 Blocks," the filmmaker Richard Donner brings back the 1980's in high-concept style. One of the action auteurs of that often cinematically benighted decade, Mr. Donner directed all four films in the "Lethal Weapon" franchise (1987-1998), which was a mistake: by the time the final installment limped into theaters, its stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover looked as exhausted as the action and dialogue. Despite the entertaining lunacy of his thriller "Conspiracy Theory," Mr. Donner faltered badly in the 1990's with films like "Maverick" and "Assassins," both of which epitomized all the worst excesses of Hollywood, including a profound lack of imagination.  If Mr. Donner's presence suggests that "16 Blocks" is a throwback to the 1980's, so too does one of the names holding pride of place above the title, Bruce Willis. The sight of Mr. Willis's name may temporarily inspire concern that this will be some kind of blockbuster revival, the live-action equivalent of Godzilla versus the Smog Monster, but the actor eases all worry when he shuffles into place. As Jack Mosley, a broken-down New York detective with a paunch and a sickly gray pallor, the star of the "Die Hard" franchise turns out to be ready to work, not sneer and wisecrack. Mr. Willis has always been an acquired taste, but for those who did acquire that taste, riding shotgun on his good times and bad, it's a pleasure to see him doing what comes naturally.  Which means holding a gun and fending off bad guys with as few words as possible. Short on words and long on action, Richard Wenk's screenplay is a compendium of familiar genre components. After one long night watching over a couple of corpses at a crime scene, Mosley is tapped to escort a prisoner, Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), to court, where he is scheduled to testify before a jury. Mr. Wenk's evident fondness for naming his characters after famous crime writers — Bunker for Edward Bunker, Mosley for Walter Mosley — seems to extend to a character, played by David Morse, called Frank Nugent, after the great Hollywood screenwriter. This is dangerous sport since such allusions invariably invite comparisons, but here it suggests that Mr. Wenk understands he is not breaking any new ground.  And so, over the course of a generally tight 105 minutes, Mr. Donner and Mr. Wenk revisit the interracial pairing that has been a staple of action movies since the late 1950's, when Sidney Poitier was chained to Tony Curtis  and which, of course, was central to the "Lethal Weapon" series. They also unleash fleets of bad cops, rumpled heavies right out of a Sidney Lumet movie, and stage an enjoyably chaotic chase with a bus that tips  "16 Blocks" owes its largest debt to Clint Eastwood's thriller "The Gauntlet." In that film, Mr. Eastwood played the tough cop while his then-lover Sondra Locke played the would-be witness, which, for those familiar with the 1977 feature, gives the pairing of Mr. Willis and Mos Def an odd frisson.  Mos Def, generally a fine actor, delivers a performance here that is at times almost as annoying as that of Ms. Locke, his voice fixed in an inexplicable nasal whine. A real motor-mouth, Eddie doesn't often shift into idle, and there are moments when his nattering seems more like the tic of a nervous screenwriter than that of a character. Happily, the two stars spend much of their time hustling and panting over packed streets, up and down staircases, through basements and across rooftops as they attempt to cover the 16 blocks that will bring them to safety and the film to a close. Until the creaky last act, Mr. Donner, whose loose shooting style intentionally (I think) creates a sense of near-vertigo, keeps them on the run — us too.  "16 Blocks" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is a lot of gunplay though not much blood.

An aging cop's last chance to redeem his soured existence provides the sturdy frame for "16 Blocks," a movie by Richard Donner that's closer to a compact film noir than to the many gimmicky entertainments of the vet director's past. Told mostly in real time, pic sticks to its guns as a spare account of how a routine transport of a witness to a courtroom turns into a chaotic cat-and-mouse chase, with police criminality at its core. Dramatic strength of Bruce Willis playing a worn-out cop will present commercial challenges in snaring a youth-oriented opening weekend crowd, but vid should pick up the slack.
Not that it ever rises to the level of Sidney Lumet's Gotham police pics ("Serpico," "Prince of the City"), but "16 Blocks" does raise the banner for the tradition of the textured urban cop drama, spurred by action but made substantial by characters at crossroads. Almost as a dare to auds fed on non-stop movement and thrills, Donner (with key ace collaboration from editor Steven Mirkovich) intros tale in a slow, steady rhythm, cued to the pace of fatigued cop Jack Mosley (Willis).
Lumbering up a flight of stairs, slumping into a sofa or considering another swig of hooch, Willis' Jack is palpably a man who's tired of life, let alone his beat on the New York force. Opening scene of Jack waiting at the crime scene for detectives has nothing to do with the central story, and everything to do with setting the mood of Jack's bedraggled existence.
Back at the office, though, Jack is asked to transport Eddie Bunker (Mos Def), in jail for a petty crime but ready to testify in a trial, to the downtown courtroom by 10 a.m. With roughly 90 minutes' lead time, Jack starts driving Eddie the 16 blocks between the police station and the court. It's not long before Jack is up to here with Eddie's non-stop chatter and with the street traffic, so he pulls over to buy some booze in a liquor store.
Pic swivels on its axis at this point, as Jack leaves the store and shoots a suspicious man trying to make Eddie roll down the back seat window of the car. Eluding more gunfire, Jack takes Eddie to his favorite Mulberry Street bar and calls for backup, only to find his 20-year-long partner Frank Nugent (David Morse) arrive with some fellow detectives.
Rather than help get Eddie to the court though, Frank intends to have Eddie -- a witness to bloody acts by some of New York's finest -- executed to stop him from testifying against him and several other colleagues.
His conscience clicking into gear, Jack shoots some of his own to free Eddie, setting off the chase's checkered flag. Although the script of "16 Blocks" can be broken down as merely a set of action pieces in which Jack and Eddie flee Frank, get cornered and flee again, Richard Wenk's screenplay is fundamentally about something else: A seemingly hollowed-out man, eaten away inside by his own moral rot, is allowed to become a reluctant hero who can set things right.
Frequently, reminders surface of such finely crafted Gotham thrillers as "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three," especially in Wenk's balancing of the realities of city life with plentiful humorous inserts and Donner's commitment to driving the film constantly forward but within the bounds of logic. One aspect that detracts from the overall effect is the decision to have Def's Eddie not just blabber on without an internal pause button, but often behave dangerously close to the stereotype of the dim, shuffling black man out of Hollywood's sorry past.
Despite this notable problem, Def is nevertheless charming, though his projection of innocence (Eddie's humble dream is to open his own bakery) seems a calculated contrast with the nefarious and heartless white cop played with characteristic focus and intensity by the highly reliable Morse. Measured by sheer amount of dialogue, Def's role is infinitely larger than Willis', but Willis--who was once the chief yakker in his movies and TV shows--finds real nobility and depth of purpose with a character for whom every word (the fewer, the better) counts.
Toronto visibly subs for New York during much of the chase, the only technical flaw in an otherwise ultra-pro production. Glen Macpherson's widescreen lensing and desaturated color scheme are exceptionally devised, and Klaus Badelt, once known for musical bombast, delivers one of his most muted and understated scores. Producer counters will note the 16 individuals so credited here.

Saying 16 Blocks  is Richard Donner 's least flatulent, most efficient film is tantamount to saying that Donner's work usually makes me want to step in front of a speeding semi. But in his dotage Donner has abandoned his Six Million Dollar Man trained blunt-force trauma and bends with the flow of the DV-era river, keeping his new movie (which is celluloid) relatively small boned, handheld, on-location savvy, and free of in-jokes. Of course, the clichés come thick on the ground: Broken-down, gimpy, alcoholic detective Bruce Willis  must escort witness Mos Def  (with a grating, put-on cartoon voice) to the courthouse, but the eponymous stretch of congested downtown Manhattan becomes a Rubicon-crossing filthy with dirty cops looking to take the punk out.
Little more than a remake of the sorry Clint Eastwood  vehicle The Gauntlet  (1977)without the Frank Frazetta  poster art and Sondra Locke 's pallid kvetchingDonner's movie, perhaps inadvertently, might be the most cynical portrait of New York cops anyone's dared to make in the years since 9-11. Whatever he might've intended, this deep into a career littered with half-thoughts and cheap shots, Donner should be careful where he parks when he comes to town. It's a small movie trying to seem epic, or a bloated monster trying to seem lean (real B movies don't have 14 producers), but it's clear that at 99 minutes, 16 Blocks  should've been at least 20 minutes shorter stillwhenever Def's wisecracking victim starts wistfully talking about his plans to open a birthday cake bakery, the movie lifts its heavy foot off the pedal and drops into a narcoleptic nap.
Ordinary credibility gaps aside, the amount of brisk urban realism and the degree to which the narrative resists spoon-feeding us plot points shouldn't seem like novelties at this stage, but they do. The massive mush factor, on the other hand, is no surprise, particularly the way it's used to demonstrate that Def's weasely character is worth rescuing because  he's sweet to kids and old people, not unlike the westerns in which lynch law is proven wrong because the victims are often innocent.
