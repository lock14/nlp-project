‘Love Happens’’ is being sold as a romantic comedy but it’s really a Big Cry movie. You know the genre: main characters who’ve suffered tragedy and lost touch with their emotions, who get redeemed by love and a few well-orchestrated crises, who lead the audience in a big, cathartic bawl at the end. It’s a tricky balancing act: Beg for sympathy too early and you’ve got corn chowder; pour on the tears too heavily at the end and it all comes apart like a wet Kleenex.
Brandon Camp’s movie doesn’t make the first mistake but trips badly over the second. It helps that he has two likable stars: Aaron Eckhart as a psychiatrist who has turned his grief over his wife’s death into a self-help cottage industry and Jennifer Aniston as a free spirit who runs a flower store.
They meet cute  - Burke smacks into Eloise in the hallway of a Seattle hotel where he’s giving a seminar  - and court cuter, but Eckhart gives his lines an edgy topspin and Aniston is well within her narrow comfort zone.
On hand as the required “wacky’’ best friends are Dan Fogler (playing Burke’s agent) and Judy Greer (as Eloise’s assistant). It’s formula but sometimes the formula works. For about half its running time, “Love Happens’’ looks like the kind of date-night headcheese you can live with.
There’s trouble a-brewing, though, not least Martin Sheen in the role of Burke’s father-in-law, glowering on the horizon like an uneasy conscience. As Burke’s “A-OK’’ seminar progresses through a long weekend (and as the agent pursues a mega-deal that could turn his client into the next Dr. Phil), “Love Happens’’ turns its attention to all the emotional gunk the hero is repressing, even as he’s coaching others to let it all hang out. The movie’s so blunt in its greeting-card symbolism that Burke even has to rescue his wife’s pet bird and let it fly free.
That scene’s pretty funny, admittedly, but it’s the last gasp of lightness before Camp and co-writer Mike Thompson open the floodgates and turn “Love Happens’’ into glycerine therapy. Not that the grieving process shouldn’t be addressed in a movie, but this one feels increasingly cooked up. Burke’s built-in illogic  - he’s a sensitive soul building a business on his wife’s death?  - becomes hard for even the actor playing him to ignore, and in the final scenes Eckhart throws in the towel and shamelessly pimps for our tears and approval.
By then the movie has become one of those sticky dramas that use working-class stiffs (John Carroll Lynch as a grieving construction worker) and hipster bohemians to lend the white-bread main characters a soul and credibility they lack on their own. Eloise has just about vanished by this point, but the movie trots her out one last time so Burke can turn up at her store for an apology scene boiled down from the last five Hugh Grant movies. “Love Happens’’? So do other things, but I can’t say what they are in a family paper.

No authentic emotion of any kind happens in this damp, Seattle-based romance, a fizzle for both stars. In Love Happens , Aaron Eckhart mimes the moods of a sad, slick motivational speaker with a specialty in grief counseling  a skill he developed after the death of his wife. Jennifer Aniston impersonates a perky, plucky singleton florist with a specialty in tilting her head inquisitively. The two mope and chirp around Seattle until finally, finally  the moper releases a parrot into the wild (don't ask) and kisses the chirper. Other stuff happens too, all of it strained and dull, with the exception of those scenes in which MVP character actor John Carroll Lynch steals the show as a grieving father.


 Until it erupts in tears, “Love Happens” dawdles along uncertainly as though debating exactly how to season its morose story with enough attempted witticisms to keep the audience from dozing off. Directed by Brandon Camp, from a screenplay he wrote with Mike Thompson, the movie stars Aaron Eckhart and Jennifer Aniston as a widowed self-help guru and the conveniently single Seattle woman who prods him into releasing his pent-up anguish.  Mr. Eckhart’s character, Burke Ryan, is a tepid pastiche of real-life powerhouses like Anthony Robbins, Werner Erhard and Dr. Phil. As the movie begins, Burke, the best-selling author of “A-OK! A Path Through Grief,” arrives in Seattle to conduct a seminar. A major multimedia deal is in the works to turn him into a brand.  Ms. Aniston’s character, Eloise Chandler, is a poker-faced floral designer he bumps into in a hotel corridor. The next time he sees her, she responds to his flirtatious overture in sign language. This gratuitous quotation from Mr. Eckhart’s breakthrough film, “In the Company of Men,” like many of the movie’s stabs at humor, is simply bizarre.  Burke’s best seller was inspired by the death of his wife three years earlier in a car crash that is recalled in several ponderous flashbacks. The ramshackle screenplay takes its time to signal that Burke, who pretends to have all the answers to emotional recovery after a loss, is clueless about his own blocked condition.  Mr. Eckhart was wonderful as a cynical, hot-wired shill of the tobacco industry in “Thank You for Smoking.” But as a self-help know-it-all who bullies people in his seminars into walking barefoot over hot coals, he is so devoid of charisma, and his character so lacking in insight, that you wonder why anyone would heed his advice. Ms. Aniston’s role is underwritten to the point that her character barely takes shape. Once again she inhabits the Hollywood stereotype of a lonely all-American gal waiting to be completed by a man. Here her super-normality isn’t simply bland; it is empty and lifeless; there is no gleam in her eye. When she and Mr. Eckhart tentatively lock lips, love doesn’t happen.  The movie’s only real feelings take place on its fringes. The truest moments belong to John Carroll Lynch, playing Walter, a rugged contractor whose life unraveled after the death of his young son. You applaud him, the rebel in Burke’s seminar,  for refusing to scamper over the hot coals. Martin Sheen also has a human moment as Burke’s tough-guy father-in-law who bares his soft side during the climactic deluge.  Otherwise the vital signs in “Love Happens,” a movie that feels likes a laboriously padded outline, are faint.  “Love Happens” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

Excise the love story, and there's a pretty good movie buried within "Love Happens" struggling to get out, mostly to little avail. Aaron Eckhart shares top billing with Jennifer Aniston, but hers is clearly a supporting role, leaving Eckhart and a fine performance by John Carroll Lynch to provide the sporadic highlights. Alas, Lynch isn't on the billboards, and those drawn anticipating romance will have to grapple with sluggish pacing and an uneven tone. So while Universal would doubtless welcome a sunnier box office forecast for this Seattle-set comedy, hey, stuff happens.
At times resembling his character in "Thank You for Smoking," Eckhart stars as Burke, who has channeled grief over losing his wife in a fatal car accident into a motivational bestseller, "A-Okay!," and a series of self-help seminars for survivors.
On the verge of inking a deal brokered by his diligent agent (Dan Fogler) that will potentially turn him into the next Dr. Phil, Burke returns to Seattle -- where his wife's buried -- to host one of these events. There, he literally bumps into a flower-shop owner named Eloise (Aniston), setting in motion a relationship filled with unconvincingly twinkly moments.
If only Burke's interplay with Eloise came close to his work with Walter (Lynch) -- a skeptical father who grudgingly attends the workshop, devastated by the loss of his son. Yet the not-too-subtle message in the screenplay that director Brandon Camp co-wrote with producer Mike Thompson (the two previously collaborated on the supernatural romance "Dragonfly" and TV's "John Doe") is that Burke talks a better game than he plays -- counseling the bereaved to shun the numbing help of alcohol, say, while conspicuously swilling Grey Goose vodka (one of several distractingly overt product plugs in the film).
Eckhart again demonstrates his willingness to undertake a variety of roles, and he's compelling enough to hold your attention -- especially in scenes with Lynch or too-brief exchanges with Martin Sheen as his estranged father-in-law. Yet almost more to service the marketing campaign than the story, the narrative keeps returning to Eloise.
Some of the casting ("Six Feet Under's" Frances Conroy, for example, appears in blink-and-miss-her fashion as Eloise's mother) hints at trims that might have occurred, and the movie still drags en route to its well-telegraphed climax. The most ill-served party, however, is Aniston, whose character never really comes into focus, seeming to exist only to advance our sympathy toward Burke. At various points she's winsome (scribbling obscure words in hidden places) yet standoffish; prone to bad personal decisionmaking yet free-spirited; and, finally, conveniently determined to lead Burke out of his funk.
Pic makes reasonably good use of its Seattle locales (while also lensing in Canada) but would have been more interesting by more fully embracing the sense of gloom that the town's frequent downpour invites.
For all that, "Love Happens" isn't necessarily bad but rather like the hyperbolic title of Burke's book: It should lose the "A-," since it's merely okay.
