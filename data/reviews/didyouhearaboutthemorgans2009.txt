From its difficult-to-remember title on down, Did You Hear About the Morgans?
 is a forgettable and lackluster fish-out-of-water rom-com. The film exploits tired stereotypes about city and country folks while being propped up by the kind of irrational narrative logic that can only exist in the movies. Paul and Meryl Morgan (Grant and Parker) are a high-profile New York City couple who have separated due to Paul�s marital infidelity. (No details are divulged, but you sort of get the feeling that Divine Brown might be lurking somewhere offscreen.) Paul desperately wants to reconcile and arranges a dinner date for the two, whereupon the couple witnesses a homicide during a postprandial walk. Having seen the killer�s face, the authorities decide it�s best, following an attempt on Meryl�s life, to place the Morgans in the Witness Protection Program and ship them to Wyoming. In the non-rom-com world, most cops might have them pore over fat books of mug shots, but then again, most other killers would hide out or skip town instead of racing all around risking exposure by bumping off the inadvertent witnesses. Of course, a week cooped up together out West reminds the couple of how much they still love each other, and as was declared in that great Western romance from a few years ago, �I just can�t quit you.� The movie�s wan script by writer-director Lawrence (Two Weeks Notice
, Music and Lyrics
) almost makes the viewer wish that actors Grant and Parker, who each here underplay their signature stammering and bubbliness, were allowed free rein to infuse their characters with greater liveliness. Used with even less regard for character definition are the supporting actors, especially Moss (so compelling on TV�s Mad Men
) and Liebman as the Morgans� personal assistants. Elliott does his usual laconic and iconic thing as the Wyoming marshal who puts the Morgans up in his home for the week. Only Steenburgen as the marshal�s gun-toting wife and partner in arrests comes out of this movie looking good. In her Western gear and with a no-nonsense attitude, Steenburgen adds a striking presence to the film. There are bears and horses and a rodeo to keep the story moving along � even a small, unnecessary role for Brimley as a quintessential Westerner. None of it feels integral to the story, and it concludes as unrealistically as it began. So now you can say, indeed, you have heard about the Morgans, smile politely, and move on to the next movie playing at the multiplex.

Regarding “Did You Hear About the Morgans?,’’ a new comedy with Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker: Yes, I have heard indeed, and the news is terrible. Most bad comedies plod from scene to scene. This one plods from sentence to sentence. Grant and Parker stand around as if they’re waiting for someone to yell, “Cut.’’ He’s in one movie. She’s in another. Neither is any good.
To be fair, they’re playing Paul and Meryl Morgan, a moneyed New York couple on the verge of divorce. One evening, an argument between them is interrupted when one of her real estate clients falls off a balcony with a knife in his back (making him the envy of paying audiences everywhere). They see the killer (Michael Kelly). The killer sees them. Before long, US Marshals have deemed the Morgans star witnesses and hide them away in a protection program that lands them in Wyoming, where the comedy is as sparse as the landscape.
This is the sort of movie where the city folk never miss a chance to condescend to their rural hosts, two married marshals, played by Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen, neither of whom is given much to say. But their exasperation feels apparent, all the same. Who can blame them? Meryl, with her disdain for meat and overcaffeinated amazement at  big-box stores, and Paul, with his English accent, are obnoxious. These aren’t personality traits, they’re screenwriting devices. The marshals even have moose heads on their wall and no cable. An amusingly Republican Wilfred Brimley is called upon to draw more blue-state blood.
As the Morgans start to fall back in love with each other, so do their assistants (Elisabeth Moss and Jesse Liebman) back in New York. Meanwhile, the killer gets closer to Wyoming. The screenplay makes this embarrassingly easy. He bugs Meryl’s office, and Meryl sneaks traceable phone calls. This is the kind of movie that seemed to come out every month in the late 1970s and 1980s  - screwball thrillers in which a woman (or two) run from a murderer. One of those Goldie Hawn-Chevy Chase movies comes to mind  - “Foul Play,’’ maybe. By their finales, the Hawn-Chase films tended to run aground, but they were funny and you could tell the people in them were having a good time.
The same can’t be said of “The Morgans,’’ which Marc Lawrence wrote and directed. Everyone looks as if they’d rather be somewhere else. I’ve seen this in Lawrence’s other romantic comedies  - several with Sandra Bullock, which he only wrote; and “Music and Lyrics’’ and “Two Weeks,’’ both with Grant.
Hawn and Chase had complementary approaches to comedy. Her breathlessness brought out something ironic in him: She made him seem like a debonair sleaze. Parker puts jokes over by feigning modesty. It’s a spotty approach. When Elliott invites her to milk a cow, she bats her eyelashes, clutches her hands, and asks, “Which one is skim?’’ It’d be a nice line were it delivered with any snap.
The less said about Grant the better. He and Parker have worked together before, in a forgettable 1996 hospital thriller called “Extreme Measures.’’ The intervening years have sapped from him any remaining interest in her. He has a bigger reaction to the brown bear that chases him (frankly, so does Parker). His punch lines are witless, too. Once they’ve left Grant’s mouth, he looks chagrined, as everyone sits around taking in the dead joke. Every time he speaks, it feels like a funeral.

Correction:  This story has been revised because of a reporting error that misidentified the actor playing the killer. His name is Michael Kelly.

Never mind about the Morgans, a squabbling Manhattan couple headed for divorce who become accidental witnesses to a murder in this labored romantic comedy. In Did You Hear About the Morgans? , Hugh Grant and Sarah Jessica Parker ply their cute trademarks (his befuddled British grimace, her la-di-da New York sass) like grim, incompatible partners in a Hollywood business deal. You should hear instead about Sam Elliott and Mary Steenburgen, who whip up cowboy fun as married U.S. marshals assigned to protect the pair in Wyoming.


 There are barely enough titter-worthy one-liners in Marc Lawrence’s good-natured romantic comedy “Did You Hear About the Morgans?” to prevent it from sinking under the weight of its clichés. Most of the throwaway witticisms drop from the pursed lips of Hugh Grant, playing Paul Morgan, a New York lawyer with Oxonian airs reluctantly transplanted to a tiny Wyoming town as part of the federal witness protection program.  After he and his wife, Meryl (Sarah Jessica Parker), a high-end New York real-estate broker, accidentally see the murder of an international arms dealer and are spotted by the killer (Michael Kelly), they have no choice but to be whisked away to cowboy country under the pseudonyms Paul and Meryl Foster. Their hosts, the laconic, growly voiced United States Marshal Clay Wheeler (Sam Elliott) and his rootin’-tootin’ cowgirl wife, Emma (Mary Steenburgen), teach the effete city slickers the simpler, more wholesome ways of the West. They also show these spoiled, high-maintenance neurotics how to have a relationship. Their secret? Just shut up and make it work!  The sleeping arrangements in the Morgans’ temporary refuge are dicey because of one major complication: Paul and Meryl have separated. Meryl won’t forgive her husband for a one-night stand, despite his pleading and groveling to be taken back. As she harangues him about his breach of trust, you are acutely aware that the shelf life of Carrie Bradshaw and her knockoffs is on the verge of expiration. Despite Ms. Parker’s strenuous efforts to charm, Meryl comes across as a shrill, self-centered middle-aged nag. Behavior that appeared kooky and cute at 34 seems pathologically immature a decade later.  Mr. Grant is more at ease, possibly because of his previous association with Mr. Lawrence, who wrote and directed “Music and Lyrics” and “Two Weeks  Notice,” in which Mr. Grant also starred. In the work of Mr. Lawrence, whose other credits include collaborating on the screenplays of the two “Miss Congeniality” films, you know what you’re getting: comedy with mostly likable, broadly drawn characters; tart, nonthreatening social satire with sharp enough teeth to leave an impression while not breaking the skin; and well-timed, modestly sophisticated repartee.  In plunking upscale blue-state urbanites into red-state territory, “Did You Hear About the Morgans?” adroitly avoids condescending to either side. The movie’s sole political reference is its mention of the 14 Democrats in the overwhelmingly Republican town. That statistic is dropped by Wilford Brimley, playing a grouchy geezer at a local cafe who takes offense when Meryl asks him to direct his cigarette smoke away from her table. “We’re not fond of city people telling us how to live,” he grumbles.  Once in Wyoming, Meryl, a vegetarian and a member of PETA, finds herself surrounded by stuffed animal heads in a house whose refrigerator is crammed with meat.  Emma, a whiz with a shotgun and an ax, jokes that for her the acronym stands for People Eating Tasty Animals.  Wyoming nights are so quiet that Paul remarks, “I thought I heard my cells dividing.” Consuming a hearty breakfast of bacon, eggs and pancakes makes him worry that he should have an angiogram. He is pathetically inept at chopping wood. The kickback from shooting a gun sends him to the doctor. Such jokes come with enough regularity that just as the movie seems about to fall asleep, a mild comic jolt wakes it up.  “Did You Hear About the Morgans?” belongs more to the Wheelers than to its title characters. Mr. Elliott, 65, is everybody’s senior-cowboy fantasy: the Marlboro man three decades later, still oozing laid-back virility. Ms. Steenburgen’s Emma suggests an older, wiser, more grounded Sarah Palin type, comfortable in her skin and her Western gear.  “Did You Hear About the Morgans?” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and sexual situations.

A fish-out-of-water story with a bit of a freshness issue, "Did You Hear About the Morgans?" stars Sarah Jessica Parker and Hugh Grant as barely civil Manhattan marrieds who witness a murder, move to Wyoming and, naturally, rediscover love, liberty and the pursuit of sappiness. While no one involved needs to go into witness protection, "Morgans" exploits enough tired presumptions about city-vs.-country life that auds might start to hear the "Green Acres" theme playing in their heads. Still, the pic's star power and writer-director Marc Lawrence's flair for the romantic-comedy-as-Jell-O-shot ("Music and Lyrics") should spell decent B.O. and even a few laughs.
Over a black-and-white opening credits sequence, we hear lawyer Paul Morgan (Grant) leaving an extended voicemail for his estranged wife, Meryl (Parker), a high-rolling New York real estate agent whose success has landed her on the cover of a major magazine. Paul is clearly trying to woo Meryl back, but his efforts annoy not only Meryl but also the couple's his-and-her personal assistants, Jackie (Elisabeth Moss) and Adam (Jesse Liebman), whose obsessive text-messaging and general careerism is neither charming nor funny. Nor, for that matter, is much of the pic's depiction of Manhattan as a soul-crushing hellhole.
Everyone looks a bit frantic and miserable. After some begging on Paul's part, Meryl agrees to dine with him at a high-end East Side restaurant (presumably so they can bum out all the other people eating $100 dinners). Taking a postprandial walk to their respective homes, they get an unexpected treat: A murder takes place on a terrace above them, the body plummets to the street, and the killer shows his face to the startled couple.
That the dead man was Meryl's client is almost completely irrelevant, and so is the ensuing narrative: Turns out the victim was an arms dealer, and the assassin, Vincent (Michael Kelly), presumably was working for a foreign agent or government. Given that the feds know all about the arms dealer and nothing about the killer, why wouldn't Vincent just leave town, his anonymity intact? Because then there wouldn't be a movie. Instead, Vincent begins hunting the Morgans, risking everything for nothing, and prompting the feds to move the warring couple to Wyoming.
Fittingly, once Paul and Meryl get out West, "Did Your Hear About the Morgans?" gets a second wind. The Morgans are received by the local marshal, Clay Wheeler (Sam Elliott, looking more and more as if his face should be embossed on a U.S. coin), and his wife, Emma (Mary Steenburgen), who are used to playing host to federal witnesses/weirdos. Which is a good thing, as the Morgans play out their little psychodrama with no regard for the thinness of the walls or the way sound can travel on a night so quiet that, as Paul says, "I think I could hear my cells dividing."
The couples get to know each other. "Do you hunt?" Emma asks Meryl. "Just for bargains," Meryl chirps, and as recycled as her line might sound (Parker's delivery could occasionally use a B12 shot), there's a certain liveliness to the way the relationships are portrayed. Clay and Emma aren't rednecks, and Meryl and Paul aren't blinkered idiots who think the world revolves around them; unlike say, Renee Zellweger's character in the woeful "New in Town," they don't act bent out of shape because they're stuck in a rustic burg, alienating the locals. They're self-effacing and fresh, even if some of the dialogue isn't.
"Morgans" moves along predictably enough -- when Paul buys grizzly-bear repellent, the question isn't whether he will accidentally spray himself in the face, but how many times. As the transplants are introduced to the inevitable charms of Western living and Western politics, Lawrence's script doesn't shy away from red-state/blue-state realities. But the charm of the film is that it resists turning people into cliches and lets Parker and Grant work their particular magic -- before they get to Wyoming, their performances are as stressed out as their characters, and while it's a dubious conceit that going cowboy is a cure-all, they put the notion across as convincingly as possible.
Steenburgen makes a sexy, lanky cowgirl and Elliott is his usual laconic/iconic self. Another institution, Wilford Brimley, delivers a something a bit bigger than a cameo as a crusty conservative and New Yorker's nightmare; between him and Elliott, it's like the National Mustache Faceoff.
Production values are top-notch.
