It's great fun to hear Shatner, as the voice of the scheming wildebeast Kazar, send up Ricardo Montalban's Khan (right down to the hazy gimlet eye) from Paramount's Star Trek
 franchise, but it's not enough to hang this entire film upon, itself a pastiche of earlier, more substantial films (both Finding Nemo
 and Madagascar
 spring to mind). That this Disney production treads familiar ground is itself no surprise � animated kids films follow a strict template, after all � but what catches you off guard is how little story there appears to be, given that four writers punched in on it. Cipes (who does vocal duties as the Beast Boy of Teen Titans
 fame) voices Ryan, the unsettled cub of "New York Zoo" lion Samson (Sutherland), who ends up being accidentally shipped to the real jungle for the first time when he falls asleep inside on of the zoo's container crates. It's of course up to Samson (who here might as well be dubbed the "Liar King") to play the noble sire and save his beloved offspring with an able assist from Zoo Yorkers Bridget the giraffe (Garafalo), Nigel the English (!) koala bear (Izzard), and best pal Squirrel (Belushi) from certain doom. The animation is top-notch, and the film sports some of the most realistic and colorful fur, feathers, and hair this side of Fashion Week in Milan. However, The Wild
 feels as though much of its backstory, along with most of the good jokes, have been cut out along the circuitous path to your neighborhood cineplex, resulting in a finished film that will probably delight the under-10 set, while leaving everyone else marveling at how bored they are. Vocally, the cast is a keeper, with both 24
's Sutherland contributing a fine performance as the wayward pop and Cipes, as the little lion who hasn't yet learned to roar (shades of Godzilla's offspring Minya, who, as I'm sure you'll recall, could only blow smoke rings), managing just the right amount of sulky spunk. But beyond that there's little to recommend of The Wild
, which, despite its title, is about as pedestrian as you can get.


Disney's new computer-generated movie, "The Wild," is chock-full of lessons that children should take to heart. The early bird gets the box-office returns is one of them. You can never have enough lawyers is another.
As your kids have probably already informed you, the plot of the new animated film is shocking in its similarity to last year's DreamWorks cartoon "Madagascar." In both, a group of animals led by a lion escapes from a New York City zoo and, after an ocean voyage, find themselves back in the jungle, where one of them is worshiped as a god by the locals and the others learn valuable life lessons. Even a toddler may find this actionable.
A little research, however, reveals that Disney has had "The Wild" in the works for more than a decade in various stages of stop-and-go development, and that it's "Madagascar" that may be the carbon copy. Certainly DreamWorks Animation head Jeffrey Katzenberg packed more than his pencils when he was forced out of Disney in 1994, as anyone who's seen Disney/Pixar's "A Bug's Life" and DreamWorks' "Antz" can attest. (Disney defenders go further, pointing to "Finding Nemo" and "Shark Tale," "The Emperor's New Groove" and "The Road to El Dorado," Disney's cafeteria decor and the inside of Katzenberg's executive washroom. All right, kidding about that last one.)
None of this matters in the cutthroat world of kiddie entertainment. "Madagascar" was released first, made its $407 million worldwide, and will be perceived as the original, while "The Wild" will be reckoned a rip-off and still make a killing on DVD. If there's a limit to how many times kids will watch the same story -- or how many times parents will keep paying for it -- it hasn't been reached yet. Maybe when "Over the Hedge" and "Barnyard" are released this summer. One can pray.
Anyway, how's the movie? Technologically incredible, aesthetically pretty hideous, and narratively lumpy: Kids who aren't cynics (i.e., 9 and under) will roll with it. The story line (by four credited writers, standing in for probably dozens more over the years) tosses in some "Lion King" generational angst by giving us Samson (voice of Kiefer Sutherland), the ferocious star of the zoo, and his rebellious young son Ryan (Greg Cipes), who's miffed that his roar hasn't broken yet. If this were the suburbs, they'd be breaking out the hormone treatments.
A midnight game of curling against some nefarious penguins results in further humiliation, and Ryan hides in a zoo crate and is accidentally taken to a cargo ship bound for Africa. Samson and his zoo pals follow: sassy giraffe Bridget (Janeane Garofalo), idiot anaconda Larry (Richard Kind), and Nigel, an Australian koala voiced with a British accent by comedian Eddie Izzard because . . . Paul Hogan was busy? Along for the ride is Benny (Jim Belushi), a tough city squirrel with Bugs Bunny's DNA.
After a rocky Atlantic crossing -- spoilsports may wonder how the heroes can make the 5,000-mile journey there and back on one tugboat tank of gas -- the critters come ashore next to a volcano that's about to pop. There's a funny bit with an angry hyrax (look it up) and Samson and Ryan work out their issues in an appropriately soggy manner, but not before the entire gang is held hostage by a herd of wildebeests who want to overturn the food chain and install themselves as meat-eating predators. Just a reminder: four, count 'em, four credited writers worked on this.
With Pixar
 temporarily in the Disney doghouse and the in-house animation wing not up to the job, "The Wild" has been brought to computer-generated life by Toronto's C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures. Led by director Steve "Spaz" Williams, the technicians are able to re-create the tawny fur of a lion and the gravelly skin of a hippo with astounding fidelity; the visuals are much more realistic than the Golden Book-meets-Rousseau look of "Madagascar."
Yet there's no grace to these characters, or to the movie as a whole, and kids deserve grace as much as, if not more than, slapstick and boilerplate moralizing. (Some of the lesser characters, like a Bollywood pigeon, are downright ugly on the eyes.) This is a movie to make you cherish Pixar all the more; where every pixel and plot turn in "Finding Nemo" snaps organically into place, "The Wild" strains just to get to the end of a scene. In the end, the issue here isn't originality of story but the larger creative bankruptcy in Hollywood family entertainment that the CGI revolution has brought about.
But don't tell that to your kids. They'll figure it out soon enough.

Lifting a concept isn't exactly foreign to the world of animation (what's The Lion King  if not Bambi  with manes?), but it isn't often a rip-off gets as blatant as The Wild , a flat-out regurgitation of Madagascar . Seriously: same overly civilized New York zoo animals, same midnight escape to the canyons of Manhattan, same stowaway to Africa, same tribe of deranged musical beasties. The difference is that where Madagascar  was witty enough to see the folly of a domesticated lion finding his untamed self, The Wild , beneath some ''wacky'' chatter, is earnest to the point of dullness.

 With its narrative resemblance to last year's "Madagascar," the latest zoo-animals-gone-native adventure, "The Wild," makes you suspect that both projects benefited from the same uncredited script doctor. The animation, however, is a different matter: where "Madagascar" was all sharp edges and blocky slabs of uniform color, "The Wild" is filled with softness and texture. When a breeze stirs the coat of Samson the lion, the hairs lift and separate just like the real thing.  The plot is at once  familiar and unexpectedly original as Samson (voiced by Kiefer Sutherland), along with a gaggle of noisy friends, escapes from the fictitious New York Zoo in pursuit of his cub, who has stowed away on a ship bound for Africa. The rescue mission allows a domesticated Samson to finally get his beast on; it also allows for inspired voice work from Eddie Izzard as a snooty koala bear and William Shatner as   a menacing wildebeest with plans to reverse the predator- prey dynamic. Some of the film's images, in fact — like a pair of sewer-dwelling alligators with hideously pockmarked hides — are shivery enough to inspire night terrors in all but the most precocious toddlers.  But while the kids are giggling at gambling pigeons and psychedelic chameleons, parents can enjoy a screenplay sensitive to the travails of single fatherhood and the evils of oppression. In "The Wild," the most valuable weapons are honesty, tolerance and the ability to be oneself.  "The Wild" is rated G.

Uninspired character animation and obnoxious banter aside, "The Wild" is ultimately done in by the persistent stench of been-there-seen-that. Trite tale about over-domesticated zoo animals taking on Mother Nature is doomed to provoke unflattering comparisons with DreamWorks' hit "Madagascar," with theatrical returns likely to provide the most glaring point of contrast. Though ancillary prospects look better, Disney's low-profile marketing push will keep away all but the most desperate families, i.e., those who have already sat through "Ice Age: The Meltdown" twice.
Whatever its flaws, "Madagascar" was at least visually all of a piece and peppered with genuinely amusing moments in its story of animals responding to the call of the wild. By contrast, this Toronto-produced kidpic, helmed by Steve "Spaz" Williams (a visual effects supervisor making his feature helming debut) from an antic screenplay credited to four writers, is notable chiefly for its inconsistent character design, reliance on scatological gags and endless cribbing from superior sources.
First reel unspools at a Gotham zoo where the animals all affect the same nonstop vaudevillian patter, dabble in weirdly anthropomorphic activities like curling and live in blissful ignorance of the food chain. Samson the lion (speaking in the gravelly tones of Kiefer Sutherland) is the unabashed star of the zoo, regaling his pipsqueak cub Ryan (Greg Cipes) and others with exciting tales of his supposedly wild origins.
Frustrated at his inability to produce a decent roar and sick of dwelling in his dad's shadow, Ryan runs away and gets himself shipped off to a distant jungle. Cub's abduction and Samson's rescue mission directly channel the father-son Sturm und Drang of both "The Lion King" and "Finding Nemo," though absent the former's powerhouse dramatics or the latter's eye-popping visual splendor.
Tagging along with Samson are the usual wisecracking suspects, including Benny (Jim Belushi), a squirrel with a creepy interspecies crush on mouthy giraffe Bridget (Janeane Garofalo); Larry, a cheerfully slow-witted snake (Richard Kind); and Nigel (Eddie Izzard), an eloquent marsupial who can't stand the stuffed koalas in the zoo's gift shops.
That Samson himself resembles a toy, with his plush, cuddly fur and none-too-persuasive digital mane, is a joke of which the pic seems unaware. Though its overall look leans more toward 3-D realism than did the more angular and stylized "Madagascar," the members of this "Wild" bunch seem to have been molded and animated with disparate aesthetic principles in mind.
The most interesting critters on display are a herd of carnivorous wildebeest, led by the bloodthirsty Kazar (voiced with sinister gusto by William Shatner). These fierce jungle inhabitants end up forcing a confrontation with Samson, who must in turn face his own oppressive daddy issues and reconcile with his son.
Script's sense of humor rarely leaves the bathroom, while every other yuk seems predicated on the animals either crashing into each other or having their heads knocked against a hard surface.
Following the dubious recent trend of laying hit pop songs over toon montages, soundtrack includes such incongruous offerings as Coldplay, as well as original songs by "Spamalot" duo Eric Idle and John Du Prez.

"It's not Pixar " is becoming the mantra of parents who dutifully shlep their tots to each new 3-D animated feature, and Disney 's latest entry won't silence them. The premise combines a largely laugh-free variation on Madagascar   with a landlocked Finding Nemo  emotional arc: A domesticated daddy lion (voice of Kiefer Sutherland ) confronts his own parenting issues when his sulky cub (Greg Cipes ) is accidentally shipped from the New York Zoo to Africa. Along with Sutherland, reduced to directing his patented Jack Bauer  bellow at a gassy cartoon hyrax, the voice cast includes Eddie Izzard , Janeane Garofalo , and William Shatner , but there's not a spark of chemistry among them. Which is too bad: They're the only personality the bland character designs have. Under Steve "Spaz" Williams' direction, the animation is exquisitely detailed, down to the lions' individually moving whiskersbut when's the last time you enjoyed a cartoon for its realism?
