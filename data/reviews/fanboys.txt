"What if the movie sucks?" one Star Wars
 fanatic asks another in 1999, just as the lights go down on the opening night of Star Wars: Episode I � The Phantom Menace
. Fanboys
 � bless its earnest, sweetly geeked heart � wisely waits till the end of the film to bring up the elephant in the room. We all know what happened next � that George Lucas' latter-era trilogy by and large sucked, the bitter taste of which still lingers � but Fanboys
 sets itself in the months leading up to the release, when hearts were still full of hope and geekboys everywhere told time by their Episode I
 countdown clock. (Austin scriptwriter Ernie Cline wrote the first draft prior to The Phantom Menace
's release.) When one of their own, newly diagnosed with a terminal illness, stares down an expiration date prior to Episode I
's release, the title's fanboys make it their holy crusade to drive cross-country to Lucas' Skywalker Ranch and break into the facility in order to watch a rough cut of the film. Fanboys
 is something of a slow starter; its leads, Huntington and Marquette, share a laconic acting style and poker-face resemblance, and their characters' rift isn't terribly interesting. But the supporting players � including Tony Award winner Fogler,  Tropic Thunder
's wiry Baruchel, and Veronica Mars
' Bell as the gang's Girl Friday � give the film enough juice to coast to a second-act peyote trip (hosted by no less than Danny Trejo) that breaks the seal on gut-busting laughs. It comes as no surprise that the film is less about fandom as it is about the community fans create with one another � who else to turn to when the object of your affection, your enduring obsession, blows big chunks? � and Fanboys
, a likable, shaggy picture, pays nice tribute to that community. (See "Fan Favorite
," Feb. 6, for an interview with screenwriter Ernie Cline.)


Die-hard Star Wars  devotees, circa 1998, embark on a cross-country mission to break into Skywalker Ranch for a guerrilla preview screening of The Phantom Menace  in Fanboys . Real-life fanboys know that the release of this mildly cute, mildly drooly, majorly too late spoof/homage has been delayed for more than two years. And during that time, an Internet-driven argument has raged about whether the final cut would retain a not-at-all-secret subplot involving the terminal illness of one of the Skywalker intruders. This critic says, ''Ick, it's a gummy sentimental intrusion.'' But the tribe spoke, saying, ''Keep it! That's why the break-in is a gallant act!'' We're both right.

 There are enough good jokes in “Fanboys,” a road comedy about geeks on a “Star Wars”-related quest, to satisfy hard-core fans of that George Lucas franchise. But the film doesn’t have the boosters, or thrusters, or whatever, to elevate it to more ambitious heights; it’s weighed down by tired conventions and a general sense of having missed its moment.  It’s 1998, and Sam Huntington, Christopher Marquette, Dan Fogler and Jay Baruchel play friends in Ohio who haven’t been able to let go of their childhood obsession with “Star Wars.” The plot device of young men who refuse to mature has never felt more exhausted, maybe because these actors or ones who look like them have already done this shtick in other movies.  The buddies decide they can’t wait any longer for the long-awaited “Phantom Menace” (which was released in 1999), and drive to California to steal a rough cut from Mr. Lucas’s ranch.  The trip is full of guy-road-trip clichés: a stop in Las Vegas, a trip to jail, assorted attempts to get female motorists to flash their breasts. But the film does get laughs out of the boys’ hostile encounters with fans of that other space franchise, “Star Trek,” and out of cameos by “Star Wars” alumni like Carrie Fisher.  “Fanboys” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for language and mooning.

The fans have spoken: In response to pressure from the online community, the cancer subplot prevails in "Fanboys," a raunchy, rough-around-the-edges comedy about five "Star Wars" nuts who fulfill a childhood pact by breaking into Skywalker Ranch for an early look at "Episode I." It's a qualified victory for a project with nearly as many alternate edits as "Blade Runner," since this version (opening Feb. 6, delayed from a September release) may satisfy the peanut gallery and preserve director Kyle Newman's vision, but exploits a less-than-solid storytelling device. Still, the resulting publicity should attract a decent geek-centric audience.
Over the course of its topsy-turvy production, "Fanboys" has become as much a cause as an actual film, an offscreen David-vs.-Goliath story pitting a handful of amateur filmmakers against the reshoot-inclined Weinstein Co. End result feels like an uneven cross between an amateur "Project Greenlight" pic and such recent comedies as "Superbad" and "Pineapple Express," in which indie directors brought a certain edge to material that might once have felt more at home under the National Lampoon label.
"Fanboys" fits squarely into the zany road-trip category, briskly introducing the five key characters while setting their Ohio-to-California pilgrimage in motion: Eric (Sam Huntington) doesn't have the nerve to tell his car-dealing dad that he wants to ditch the family business and draw comicbooks; loudmouth Hutch (Dan Fogler) hopes to move out of his mother's carriage house; socially awkward Windows (Jay Baruchel) can't wait to meet an online girlfriend who calls herself "Rogue Leader"; tomboy goddess Zoe (Kristen Bell) can't seem to get her soulmate's attention; and terminally ill Linus (Christopher Marquette) is living with the possibility that he may not be around when "The Phantom Menace" opens.
With Linus' death hanging over their heads, the friends hit the road in Hutch's old van, which he has customized with such features as a nitrous oxide tank (for those unexpected jumps to light speed) and a roof-mounted R2-D2 model. The gang's plan sends them ping-ponging all over the country, first to Iowa, where they pick a fight with a group of "Star Trek" fans led by a barely recognizable Seth Rogen, then south to Austin, Texas, where uber-fanboy Harry Knowles (played by "My Name Is Earl's" Ethan Suplee) roughs them up a bit, then to Vegas to meet a man with blueprints to Skywalker Ranch.
Cameos from such geek idols as William Shatner, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams and Ray Park spice up the group's adventures, which otherwise lean toward the predictable: mistaking a session with two Sin City escorts for getting lucky, tripping on Native American herb beneath the desert stars and landing in the slammer for trying to outrun a police officer.
Their life-changing trek marks a spiritual journey of sorts, one governed by a form of pop-culture worship in which George Lucas' "Star Wars" mythology serves as the prevailing religion. It's a generational thing, but a tactic that should play well to twenty- and thirtysomethings who define themselves by such touchstones as "Scooby-Doo," "Back to the Future," "Dirty Dancing" and Super Nintendo, all of which are freely referenced here.
Above all else, "Fanboys" remains an enthusiastic attempt to pay tribute to the film that sparked countless fans' love for the movies. Still, Newman and company have stiff competition in this sector: "Fanboys" arrives on the heels of much funnier made-for-TV "Star Wars" homages by "Robot Chicken" and "Family Guy." It helps that Lucas gave the film his blessing, allowing key sound effects to be used (light-saber whooshes accompany the Weinstein Co. logo that opens the film), although bursts of John Williams' score would have gone a lot further than Mark Mothersbaugh's next-best-thing music.
Though not as dirty-minded as, say, Kevin Smith and Jason Mewes, who pop up for a bad-taste bit part here, screenwriters Ernest Cline and Adam Goldberg provide an awful lot of bodily-function humor for a film in which no actual sex takes place.
In the version screened for fans at Comic-Con, said to be the final cut agreed upon for theatrical release, pic is set in motion by the cancer plot device but avoids lingering on sentimental scenes toward the end. Soundtrack contains fewer Rush songs than Hutch's character may have wanted, and things go a little haywire when Danny McBride shows up as Lucas' lead "THX-1138"-costumed security guard, but tech credits are more than adequate despite the relative inexperience of those involved.

Fanboys  is meant for the dude who's content to simply stare at an Imperial storm trooper's empty helmet for 90 minutes. It's for the two childhood friends who parted ways back in junior high over a dispute about whether Captain James T. Kirk  could kick Han Solo 's ass. And it's for every girl who ever donned a Princess Leia  Jabba-palace slave-girl costume, lest her boyfriend refuse her access to the Dianoga under his robe.
So there's your target audience—Kevin Smith , in other words, who cameos as himself in a film loaded with more "what the . . . ?" guests than an entire season of The  Love Boat . For the rest of you, find something—anything— better to do. Fanboys  is little more than Star Wars   porn about four friends traveling cross-country in 1998 to sneak a peek at a rough cut of Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace   months before its release. Not exactly The Odyssey , but for fans it'll do at least until a new Clone Wars  airs Friday night on the Cartoon Network .
Every scene here is a money shot punctuated by some obscure line of dialogue meant to serve as a punch line. Every frame is stuffed with a Comic-Con 's worth of Star Wars  toys, bedsheets, and T-shirts—enough vintage detritus to keep the faithful engaged when the plot sags and the jokes go limp, which is most of the time. The movie has been on the shelf almost as long as the aging merchandise: Scheduled for release last year, it's been the long-rumored subject of reshoots. Clearly, there weren't enough.
Directed by Kyle Newman  and credited to at least four screenwriters you've never heard of, Fanboys  coasts on its affection for a 31-year-old franchise and the bare bones of a plot. Lifelong pals Eric (Sam Huntington ), Linus (Chris Marquette ), Hutch (Dan Fogler ), and Windows (Jay Baruchel ) trek from Ohio to California in an ancient van tricked out like the Millennium Falcon . Linus is dying (but never looks like it), while Eric's about to sell out and run his dad's used-car franchise—right, the Dark Side. Hutch and Windows are the accessories, comic-store clerks in need of an adventure. If nothing else, they could use the sunlight and exercise.
The jokes, such as they are, consist of little more than Star Wars  lines recited out of context—most of them variations on "These are not the droids you're looking for." It feels like the filmmakers' way of saying, "This is a movie for members only." The dork knights will howl and squeal to the point of dampness at the sight of Ethan Suplee 's karate-kicking version of Ain't It Cool News   kingpin Harry Knowles , who's actually the mirror opposite of his depiction here. Unfortunate interlopers will offer a WTF shrug and go get laid.
The one genuine bright spot among the performers is Kristen Bell  as Windows's would-be girlfriend, his dream combination of Sarah Michelle Gellar  and Janeane Garofalo . She nails it—half-nerd, half-hottie, and altogether tougher than any of the guys in the van. The other cameos are more dispiriting: Seth Rogen  appears in two equally humiliating roles, as a pug-nosed, gap-toothed, lisping Star Trek   fan and as a pimp; Billy Dee Williams  plays a judge named Judge Reinhold ; Carrie Fisher  appears solely to repeat a brief line of dialogue from Return of the Jedi  ; Smith and Jason Mewes  make a pit stop in a gas station's men's room for oral sex; and William Shatner  once more plays himself in what's become a forced march of self-parodies. You're better off watching The Star Wars Holiday Special  on YouTube. At least Bea Arthur  sings.
