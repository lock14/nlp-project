At the beginning of Duplicity
, Gilroy�s latest conspiracy thriller, the heads of two pharmaceutical companies (played by Giamatti and Wilkinson) fly at each other across an airport tarmac, crazed with rage. First they�re nose to nose, shouting, then somebody kicks somebody else�s shin, and suddenly it�s two titans of industry scrapping on the asphalt like schoolboys. Gilroy plays the scene in slo-mo, with the diegetic sound cut out (James Newton Howard�s aggressively frenetic score plays instead); the effect has something of the comic grotesquerie of a Bill Plympton cartoon. It�s a sparky way to start a picture, but the scene (over which the opening credits unspool) goes on too long and turns lumbering. A longtime screenwriter of lean and mean actioners, such as the Bourne
 trilogy, who made his directorial debut with 2007�s terrifically malevolent Michael Clayton
, Gilroy is still trafficking in scheming and double-dealing, but he makes a bid here for something brighter, in the wink-and-a-smile tradition of Ocean�s Eleven
 or Out of Sight
. Gilroy�s Michael Clayton
 star, George Clooney, headlined both of those, of course, and one can�t help but wish Gilroy had convinced him to suit up for Duplicity
 as well; Owen is a very fine actor, but when stripped of his signature menace, he has a slack, dopey look about him. He plays Ray Koval, an MI6 agent who butts heads with a CIA op named Claire Stenwick (Roberts, with whom Owen had more compelling chemistry in Mike Nichols' acidic Closer
). The overlong film plays fast and loose with timelines � part of its fun is in its many nesting-egg reveals of who�s double-crossing who and in what year and in what exotic locale (Dubai, Rome, Cleveland) � so I will say very little about the plot itself, save that both agents join the private sector and wind up in security for the research and development departments of the opening frames� rival pharmaceutical companies. Gilroy zings the film with tantalizing bits of absurdity (one wonders, wistfully, what the Coen brothers would have done with this material), but too often he returns to his darker, more ponderous instincts � more like a wink and a sneer � which has an enervating effect on a film that lives and dies by its fleetness of foot.

In "Duplicity," Clive Owen looks like he just wandered in from the other thriller that has him trotting the globe in expensive-looking suits. "The International" is a business-like conspiracy thriller that opened last month and deserves a better audience than it's getting. "Duplicity" stands to get a fairer hearing, since, for one thing, it's more conventionally enjoyable and, for another, Owen's partner in entertainment is Julia Roberts, who has returned from wherever she's been to show the Jessicas (Alba, Biel, etc.) and Scarletts of the world how it's done.
Written and directed by Tony Gilroy, who also made "Michael Clayton," "Duplicity" is a twisty suspense comedy bobbing at the same end of the pool as certain Coen brothers' movies and those Steven Soderbergh "Ocean's" capers, which is to say that it's reasonable to expect George Clooney to show up and serve everybody mojitos.
And like "The International," "Duplicity" is also a business-like conspiracy thriller. But the conspiracy here is pitched in the key of romantic faith: "You're conning me!" "No, my love, you're conning me!" Rarely has  distrust been trumped up as such a sex fetish.
Roberts and Owen play a pair of ex-agents  - she was CIA; he was MI6  - using their years in government intelligence to make money as corporate spies. They meet at a party in Dubai and go to bed together. She steals Egyptian air defense codes from him. He spends the rest of the movie trying to wring an apology from her. He continues even after they've teamed up to exploit a product war between two mega-manufacturers (of toiletries and the like) for a multimillion-dollar payday.
Roberts infiltrates Manhattan's Burkett & Randall, whose regal titan, Howard Tully (Tom Wilkinson), runs his company as grandly as some of Shakespeare's kings lord their kingdoms. She's installed Owen into the team of casual surveillance experts whom Tully's rabid opponent, the unappetizingly named Dick Garsik (Paul Giamatti), has hired to steal B & R's secrets.
For the record, Roberts's character's name is Claire Stenwick, and Owen's is Ray Koval, but Gilroy maintains an air of mistrust so extensive that you don't believe anything they tell each other, starting with their names. In order to keep myself from getting hurt, they were just Clive and Julia to me. In order to keep myself from being confused, I tried to stop following the scrambled chronology and datelines  -Rome, Geneva, San Diego, Dunwoody, Ga. When Owen tracks down Roberts in New York, five years after she betrayed him in Dubai, they have some lightning-round banter (he's hurt; she's sorry but she has no idea what he's talking about) that we hear them perform again, verbatim, in Rome, two years before that. What are they up to?
At some point, I got lost, anyway (not in the romance but because of it) and waited for Gilroy to stop toying with us and shake things out, which eventually he does. In the meantime, your time is better spent appreciating how Roberts and Owen are surrounded by so many superb character actors: Kathleen Chalfant, Rick Worthy, and Denis O'Hare are on the surveillance team; Tom McCarthy and Wayne Duvall work with Roberts inside Burkett & Randall; and the wonderful Carrie Preston, as a poor office patsy Owen seduces, snivels her way onto Roberts's nerves.
This movie is a breeze compared to the lawyerly Sturm und Drang of "Michael Clayton." "Duplicity" is guided by the suggestion that America is a land where the Cold War now consists of two superpowers trying to dominate the nasal decongestant market. In both films, Gilroy is clearly fascinated by what the average person has come to hate about large, venal companies: how they can get away with anything. But for the new film, he's redefined the ethical contract. Now a corporation is only as corrupt as its most loyal employees. To that end, the gotcha finale is a new contradiction: a rousing anticlimax.
Corporate anomie aside, the engine driving this film is sidelong romance of the "North by Northwest" or "Charade" school. Gilroy still takes himself far too seriously to make a great comedy, yet he's made a good stepchild to those older movies, which were as concerned with their stars' images as they were with clean, classical storytelling. I appreciate the idea of Roberts trying to look anonymous, wearing espadrilles tall enough to put her on the moon. It's like a giraffe to try to hide under a hen.
Gilroy's master joke reconsiders all those years of Roberts's characters being incidentally vindicated and validated by money courtesy of love  - in "Pretty Woman," "Erin Brockovich," and two "Ocean's" movies, for starters. Sometimes, as in "Brockovich" the payday could be nauseating. But throughout "Duplicity," she at least is in charge, going right after the loot herself.
Even when Owen out-talks her, Roberts always has the upper hand. She's among the very last self-secure movie stars we have. And at the brink of middle-age (she's 41), her face has acquired an almost exotic refinement. She just needs a cubist to move the parts around. What she has with Owen (they screamed and yelled at each other in Mike Nichols's "Closer") is not as electric as what she and Clooney bring out of each other. With Owen, the bond is strangely platonic. (Not for nothing, the entire movie hinges on the retrieval of an elusive chemical formula.) But what they lack in eroticism they make up for with teasing comic connection. Watch his face go white when they banter over some underwear she says she found in his apartment.
Their comedy is almost as good as a sensual spark. The Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie of "Mr. and Mrs. Smith" gave us a long, frightening peek into their boudoir power dynamics. It was, "Who's on top?" With Roberts and Owen, it's gentler. The question is, "Who's on first?" If there's a problem with this, it's that the entire movie is predicated on lies being a turn-on. So ultimately it doesn't matter whether he believes that she loves him. We're not sure we do.
When Roberts is in bed with Owen at a Roman hotel, should we believe her smile? Doesn't asking amount to a kind of Hollywood heresy. In that mouth we trust, right? But "Duplicity" so thoroughly equates sex and money that, in a manner apt for a recession, the audience is rewired when it's over. You don't care whether they love each other. You just want to see them paid.

The world has changed since the release of Michael Clayton  in 2007. Real dirty tricks, in our Bernard Madoff-infected era of diminished prosperity, feel even less tolerable than they did two years ago; fictional dirty tricks feel less   entertaining. The mood swing may result in a beneficial recalibration of our national moral compass, but the course correction wreaks havoc on our appetite for playfulness. Today's worried taxpayer may not be in the mood for the diversion to be found in Duplicity , a determinedly lighthearted movie about corporate malfeasance with billion-dollar repercussions. Like Michael Clayton , Duplicity  was written and directed by Tony Gilroy. And as with his earlier feature, Gilroy's articulate script is a stylish structure engineered to support sly double crosses, fake-outs, and gotchas. Unlike in Clayton , though, the twists in this new puzzle are their own ends, not the means to express a more resonant despair. And puzzles feel so very...pre-Obama. As a result, the quick-witted banter whipped up by Gilroy would mean little if it weren't voiced by fabulously attractive actors.
In this last challenge, at any rate, Duplicity  is in luck: The movie features Julia Roberts and Clive Owen as Claire and Ray, a couple of corporate spies  and a couple in love  who must hide their romance while appearing to work as snoops on the payrolls of competing multinational pharmaceutical companies, ferreting out the details of a revolutionary new product under development. The kick is that Claire and Ray never really trust one another, nor should they, since each is regularly punk'd. And so is the audience; an accretion of flashbacks to romantic skirmishes that took place in other cities, on previous calendar dates, teaches the viewer to discard logic (and think fondly of the more energetic globe-scrambling action that powered Gilroy's scripts for the Bourne  trilogy). The movie's accepted rule is that consequences don't matter, not when Roberts and Owen look so glamorous and handsome together. (There Will Be Blood  cinematographer Robert Elswit shoots the pair as if through a brandy glass, all rich tones and honeyed sophistication; Albert Wolsky costumes the two in the classiest contemporary wardrobe I've seen in years.) Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti add cartoon color as the respective pharma CEOs, the former a sleek great white shark, the latter a more nervous and more amusingly Giamattian hammerhead. And to seal the deal on   frivolity, the secret product so desperately tracked turns out to be—well, let's say in bald terms, it doesn't contain powers of life or death. The filmmaker left that  heaviness   behind with the conscience-stricken company man played by Wilkinson in Michael Clayton .
Duplicity  doesn't have depth  but it does have Julia Roberts, in full Hollywood movie-star mode. And for filmgoers with scaled-back expectations, that news may be enough. It is an undeniable thrill to see her again  amazingly, naturally, inimitably starry as ever over 20 years into her scrutinized   career, her sleek, horsey, long-limbed charms   communicable with a simple trademark beaming smile. Here is a celebrity addressable on a first-name basis  not an approach  recommended when extending a hand to pet the tigress Angelina Jolie. Julia is her own top secret product.
But Julia  er, Ms. Robert  definitely needs the right partner to set off her strong features. And here, too, this over-the-counter-strength movie, fine for a tickle but useless for making sense of what ails the American soul, benefits from prescription-strength chemistry between leading lady and leading man. Owen, with his own hooded, faintly   dangerous sex appeal and onscreen history with Roberts (the two fought so nakedly in Closer ), encourages his costar to let loose not just her pealing laugh but also her mature steeliness. Gilroy counts on a Thin Man -style undercurrent of sexual sparring to sustain our interest in two scheming corporate operatives despite the fact that nothing much else is going on. But if that's all he wanted, he might well have paired Roberts with her old Ocean 's comrade in flirtatious tomfoolery, Clayton  star George Clooney. Owen's edge only makes a duplicitous viewer  me  wish there were more at stake than the game.

 “Duplicity”: the title suggests something with two sides, but the film itself, the second (after “Michael Clayton”) written and directed by Tony Gilroy, has many more layers and facets.  Its densely coiled plot and splintered chronology reveal a cascade of familiar genres and styles. It’s a caper movie, a love story — with Clive Owen and Julia Roberts, no less —  an extra-dry corporate satire. However you describe it, “Duplicity” is superior entertainment, the most elegantly pleasurable movie of its kind to come around in a very long time.  The kind of movie it seems most obviously to be — the jet-set spy thriller, decorated with eye-candy vistas of London, New York, Dubai and Rome (among other intrigue-ridden spots) — has suffered a bit of an identity crisis since the end of the cold war. Yes, the James Bond franchise soldiers on, but even at the height of Soviet-American brinksmanship, 007 always conducted his tongue-in-cheek operations on the margins of the grand geopolitical chess game, facing down cartoon supervillains rather than K.G.B. alter egos. It was symmetry — two big nations, armed to the teeth, sending brilliant, cynical operatives out to do their shadowy dirty work — that defined the classic spy game in, for instance, the novels of John le Carré. But the current age of asymmetrical, decentralized conflicts has taken some of the fun and the moral complexity out of fictional espionage, on screen and off.  In his scripts for the three vertiginously involuted “Bourne” movies, Mr. Gilroy has tried to restore some of those qualities, building a fascinating puzzle on the meager foundation of Robert Ludlum’s airport doorstops. “Duplicity,” in the absence of contending, more or less evenly matched superpowers, deploys two multinational corporations, Burkett & Randle and Equikrom, who conduct a steely, ruthless game of proxy battles, psy-ops, counterintelligence and disinformation. Their executives talk the language of grand strategy and total war, and even though their battlefield is the global market for dandruff shampoo, premium diapers and moisturizing creams (or lotions —  the distinction apparently matters), nobody regards the stakes as trivial.  The only moment of actual violence in this marvelously tense film,  and the only scene of true slapstick in a very funny picture,  comes during the opening titles, when the chief executives of the two companies come to blows on a rain-soaked tarmac in front of their corporate jets, seconded by squads of anxious senior vice presidents. I could have watched their flailing, sputtering fisticuffs, played in slow motion with the sound drained away, for at least two hours, imagining any number of real-life C.E.O.’s in place of Paul Giamatti and Tom Wilkinson, who play the two angry captains of industry. Even if the rest of  “Duplicity” had fizzled, it would be worth seeing for that sequence alone.  Happily, the movie effervesces instead. The epic struggle between Burkett & Randle and Equikrom is, in a way, a global-capitalism red herring, the scaffolding for a different, more intimate sort of combat. If what thrills you is the swift-moving, unrelenting contest between equal and opposing forces, then the movies you seek out are surely the great romantic comedies of the studio era, verbal boxing matches that draw blood and end in kisses. And you have to go back that far — to the glory days of Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant, let’s say — to find a duel of sharp wits, hidden agendas and simmering desires as satisfying as what transpires between Julia Roberts and Clive Owen.  The two of them failed to generate much of a spark in Mike Nichols’s “Closer,” but that was surely because the atmosphere in that somber little chamber piece was too damp. Here, from the moment they meet, sipping frozen drinks at a Middle Eastern Fourth of July barbecue, a crackle of sexual tension ignites between them.  “Are you always like this?” she asks, responding to pickup lines that sound as if they were memorized from a feature in Maxim.  “No,” he confesses. “I sometimes act like this, but this is completely different.”  And so he charms her into bed — or rather, falls into the honey trap she has rigged just by standing around the garden in a flowery dress, looking bored. She — Claire is what she’s called, though who knows if it’s her real name — is C.I.A.; he — we’ll call him Ray — is MI6. Apparently they’re not on the same side, but that’s a minor political detail in which the movie has no further concern.  The point of Claire’s initial double cross is to map out the intersection of her and Ray’s professional and sexual interests. He is burned, humiliated, unmanned — and totally smitten. What follows between them is perhaps his revenge, perhaps her repentance and maybe her second act. He was so easy to fool the first time, after all.  Five years after that first, ambiguous roll in the hay, Claire and Ray, retired from government work, are embroiled in the Burkett-Equikrom war. A series of flashbacks establishes that they are working together, but the point of each of those scenes, which bring us closer to the present (via London, Miami and Cleveland), is to make us wonder which is playing the other. Or even, hard as it may be for Ray or Claire or anyone else to believe, whether their allegiance, rooted in lust, greed and maybe something more, is sincere and aboveboard after all.  Along the way, Mr. Owen, on whom a two-piece suit becomes as brazenly sexual a uniform as anything you can imagine, opens many bottles of Champagne and looks hungrily at Ms. Roberts, even though Claire is more of a natural predator than Ray. For this  film, her first real starring role in quite a while, Ms. Roberts has almost entirely left behind the coltish, America’s-sweetheart mannerisms, except when she uses them strategically, to disarm or confuse. Curvier than she used to be and with a touch of weariness around her eyes and impatience in her voice, she is, at 41, umistakably in her prime.  Mr. Gilroy’s most ingenious structural gamble — the duplicity of “Duplicity”  — is to make foreground and background almost perfectly reversible. It’s  a sharp, sexy comedy masquerading as a twisty tale of intrigue, and vice versa. And as soon as you grow impatient with the pre- or postcoital repartee of Ms. Roberts and Mr. Owen, a nimble army of supporting players comes forward to deliver Mr. Gilroy’s mordantly funny dialogue with perfectly straight faces.  Mr. Giamatti and Mr. Wilkinson are a perfectly mismatched set, embodying different styles of corporate arrogance, while their underlings and enforcers (notably Denis O’Hare, Kathleen Chalfant,  Tom McCarthy and Rick Worthy) display the varieties of sycophancy, treachery, vanity and incompetence found in every cubicle farm, ever so slightly heightened for comic and suspenseful effect. (Carrie Preston is also marvelous in a few scenes as a Burkett & Randle employee who falls for Mr. Owen in his purest and slyest Cary Grant moment.)  How does it all end? With a flurry of surprises, and also more or less as you always suspected it would. But the answer really depends on which movie you think you’ve been watching:  the one about love or the one about power; the cynical farce or the secretly sincere examination of manners and morals in the age of globalization; the cat-and-mouse or the dog-eat-dog. Not that you can necessarily tell, until the very last moment, which is which.  “Duplicity” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its sex is more innuendo than act, its violence almost entirely rhetorical.

An ultra-sophisticated love story between two corporate spies with pronounced mutual trust issues, "Duplicity" is a brainy, non-violent "Mr. and Mrs. Smith," the film "Intolerable Cruelty" wanted to be, a "Trouble in Paradise" for modern times. Smart, droll and dazzling to look at and listen to, writer-director Tony Gilroy's effervescent, intricately plotted puzzler proves in every way superior to his 2007 success "Michael Clayton." The twisty, time jumping narrative forces viewers to keep on their toes, and it could well be that "Duplicity" is too smart for its own good as far as the popcorn masses are concerned. Still, this is about as good as it gets these days for sharp-minded Hollywood entertainment made for an intelligent audience, and Universal can only hope that Julia Roberts, in an excellent return to leading lady form, still has the B.O. pull to put this one over.
Although the depredations of the corporate world again lie at the heart of things for Gilroy, this time he has a lot more fun with them, setting the tone with a slap-happy opening credits sequence backgrounded by two titans of industry (Tom Wilkinson and Paul Giamatti) coming to blows in exaggerated slow motion in front of their respective private jets as aghast entourages look on.
The stakes are very high here in both love and commerce, the participants are all savvy and hold their cards close, and the winners are those who play the deepest game; who they may be Gilroy craftily keeps a mystery until the very end. In the meantime, there is exceptional pleasure to be taken from watching the consummate pros before and behind the camera play such captivating make-believe with such engaging characters.
In a tangy Dubai-set opener that establishes a sexy vibe that never diminishes across two hours, MI6 agent Ray Koval (Clive Owen) insinuates himself into bed with CIA op Claire Stenwick (Roberts). Five years later, in 2008, Ray encounters Claire again in Grand Central Station, but she adamantly insists she doesn't remember him. Over the course of the film, their opening gambit repartee becomes a running gag that assumes different flavors based on the time and place, just one clever invention in a film full of them.
Lured from government work into the far more lucrative world of corporate counter-intelligence, the mutually irresistible lovers plot a scheme by which they will spy for rival firms - Burkett & Randle, headed by Howard Tully (Wilkinson), and Omnikrom, led by Dick Garsik (Giamatti) - and hope to make off with enormously profitable secrets. Triggering such an opportunity is a procured handwritten letter revealing B&R's imminent announcement of a bombshell product guaranteed to generate giant profits. But both its nature and formula must be obtained for the discovery to be any use to either Omnikrom or the two moles.
Claire and Ray understand one another perfectly: They both know neither will ever meet a more suitable match, but they also have every reason not to trust the other; Claire pulls a fast one on Ray on their initial tryst, while Ray, among other deceptions, unsettles Claire by seducing a vulnerable office drone (a terrific Carrie Preston) to procure vital information. Neither wants to be the first to show weakness by uttering an incontrovertible truth, or by confessing love for the other.
All this game playing provides Gilroy with the opportunity to refashion the urbane, snappy repartee of 1930s romantic comedies in a darker, harder edged contemporary context. By pulling off this high-wire act, he shows himself to be one of the few current writers who could possibly have held his own in the august company of his stage-and-newspaper-trained forebears. His dialogue has snap, rhythm and wit, and all the actors in the picture show their appreciation by making it sing or sting, as the occasion requires.
With knowledge no doubt acquired in part while toiling on the three "Bourne" features, Gilroy juices the drama with a dazzling array of surveillance techniques the two companies use to pry into the other's business; whether they're true or not, they're entirely credible in context, as is the unreserved corporate avarice that audiences will more eagerly swallow today than they might have even a year ago. 
The screenplay shuffles the chronological deck � the action perpetually shifts to "2 Years Ago," "10 Days Earlier," and so on � in ways that only a complete physical exam could prove to be necessary rather than whimsical. But what the calendar jumbling does accomplish is to provide a nice cyclical pattern to the intimate scenes between the romantic leads, which keeps the sexual heat turned up in the midst of so much devious plotting and derring-do. No matter where in the world the action takes them - settings include Rome, Switzerland, the Bahamas, Miami, London, San Diego and Cleveland in addition to New York and Dubai - Claire and Ray always find a time and place to jump-start their romance, which provides an emotional core to parallel the film's intellectual assessment of corporate mischief.On the surface, "Duplicity" is escapist fare fronted by beautiful stars wearing gorgeous clothes in chic locations made to look extra-alluring by Robert Elswit's shimmering camerawork. But these are routine qualities compared to some of the other levels on which the film excels, most notably in its adroit synthesis of pulsing drama, bright humor, heady romance, unapologetic maturity, zero tolerance for fools and cheeky awareness of its rejiggered conventions. 
Reteamed after working together in "Closer" (2004), Roberts and Owen manifest excellent chemistry. An ultra-competent control freak, Claire is a woman almost impossible to surprise or impress, and Roberts' stature feeds into these traits. Her glances and glacial stare-downs rep some of her best moments here, but she's also very good at recalibrating Claire's degree of toughness when Ray demonstrates he can match her at her own game. 
As for Owen, this reps a very welcome rebound from the similarly globe-trotting "The International," where he was locked into a state of unrelieved grubbiness and anger. Here, he looks debonair (certain moments suggest what he might have been like as James Bond) and keeps a sensitive finger on his co-star's pulse, which serves to quicken his own.
Aside from Wilkinson and Giamatti, both delicious as kings of industry whose egos and ambitions know no bounds, supporting cast has been adroitly filled out with moderately familiar faces that have the virtue of not popping up several times a year in movies or on TV.
Film's craftsmanship is of the highest level, from Kevin Thompson's production design that complements the locations in evoking many settings and Albert Wolsky's always flattering costume design to a vibrant, nicely spiced score by James Newton Howard. As neither the shooting nor the editing trade in trendy jitters or jumpiness, one wobbly hand-held shot stands out like a black eye. In every respect, "Duplicity" is a film made with total assurance and savoir faire.


Whether it's the amnesiac super-spy of the Bourne  franchise or the weary law-firm fixer of Michael Clayton  ,  Tony Gilroy  specializes in characters who wear so many masks that, memory loss or no, they scarcely know who they are anymore. Guided by instinct, his soldiers of fortune patrol a ruthless landscape of big government and bigger business, where truth is traded like any other commodity and dissenting voices are more often silenced than heard. So it's of little surprise that, for his second film as director, Gilroy leans heavily on his favored tropes of international espionage and cutthroat capitalism. The surprise is that Duplicity  is a comedy—about two people who love each other more than they could ever trust each other—and a superb one at that.
Whatever one thought of the undeniably smart, often unbearably overwrought Michael Clayton , few would have pegged it as the work of an inspired farceur. Yet Duplicity  is nearly as bubbly as the champagne whose corkage becomes a running motif, as if the heretofore dour Gilroy were finally releasing a long-suppressed giggle. Even the corridors of corporate malfeasance are a markedly less sinister place this time around; where the fictional petrochemical giant of Michael Clayton  considered staged suicides and car bombs the cost of doing business, the worst one can expect from Equikrom, Duplicity 's Proctor & Gamble –esque manufacturing behemoth, is that it will steal its competitors' garbage (and closely guarded R&D secrets).
The job of executing this trash-heap skullduggery falls to a team of intelligence experts, including two former government operatives who've retired to the private sector. Ex-CIA officer Claire Stenwick  (Julia Roberts ) is already deep undercover as a mole inside Equikrom's chief rival, Burkett & Randle, when ex-MI6  agent Ray Koval  (Clive Owen ) comes aboard the Equikrom team. Theirs is a tense reunion, stemming from an episode of drunken flirtation, lovemaking, and stolen Egyptian air-defense codes five years prior. But they agree to set aside their differences in order to focus on the mission at hand: penetrate the firewall surrounding Burkett's new, top-secret "miracle" product. It all seems straightforward enough, until we discover that this isn't the first—or even the second (or the third)—time Claire and Ray have crossed paths in the last half-decade. By which point, Duplicity  is already a few paces ahead of us, and it's only just getting started.
I could say that the fun of Gilroy's who's-conning-whom bauble, which ping-pongs about in time and place from New York to Rome  to London and back, comes from not knowing where it's headed next. That's partly true, but the rarer pleasure is the confidence that Gilroy inspires, such that where he's taking us hardly matters at all. Like the tart-tongued screwball romps of the 1930s and Soderbergh's latter-day screwball Out of Sight , Duplicity  luxuriates in implausible situations, high-caliber dialogue that ricochets off every Dolby Digital  speaker, and two immensely likable movie stars who possess the thing that no amount of intra-agency packaging can will into being: chemistry. After schlepping his bedraggled self through the torpor-inducing hoops of The International , Owen here gets to travel in far more suitable Giorgio Armani  style, while Roberts (at her most radiant) steals what may be the movie's funniest scene without saying a single word.
Comedy seems to have liberated Gilroy, who directs Duplicity  with the high gloss and fleet-footed hustle of a golden-age Hollywood  craftsman. There's nary a dull stretch in its two-hour breadth, and the edges and corners of the frames pop with colorful support from the likes of Paul Giamatti  and Tom Wilkinson  as Equikrom and Burkett's dueling CEOs, whose slow-mo airport-tarmac throwdown underneath the movie's opening credits generates much early cheer. A Darwinian at heart, minus the Coen Brothers ' irrepressible misanthropic streak, Gilroy seems drawn, above all, to creatures of habit and the ways they adapt—or don't—to environmental changes. So the spies of Duplicity  keep spying (on their bosses and themselves) and the competitors keep competing, whether they need to or not. Like Gilroy himself, they exult not in the game, but in the playing.
