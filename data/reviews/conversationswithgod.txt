The bestselling self-help book Conversations With God
 is the kind of feel-good treacle that seems to come around every few years to inspire an entire nation full of seekers and lost souls and then vanish again into the ether, only to be replaced by a different Oprah-approved spiritual guidebook. Conversations With God
 the movie probably shouldn�t have been made, or if it had to be, it should have happened years ago, when the book was at the height of its popularity, and maybe some real money could have been thrown into it. As it stands, this humble (in budget, not theological ambition) little movie plays out like a Hallmark movie of the week, full of simple life-affirming lessons about a generous, forgiving God and the redemptive possibilities of love and charity. Czerny (Mission: Impossible
, The Ice Storm
) stars as Neale Donald Walsch, a down-on-his-luck transient whose life is turned upside down when he hears the voice of God speaking to him one night. Turns out God has been listening to Walsch�s questions and complaints over the years and he wants the chance to respond. Which he does, generously, with a seemingly endless supply of corny aphorisms and self-help platitudes. When a reborn Neale turns these conversations into a book, publishers come from out of the woodwork to release it, and hungry souls from all corners start looking to him for answers. Corny and harmless, Conversations With God
 is a humanistic little movie with a real belief in the power of redemption and a positive enough message: �Love is the answer.�  Or: �Go to your Godspace.� Whichever speaks more clearly to you.

         I wanted to have my own heart-to-heart with the Lord after watching "Conversations With God," a biopic-infomercial that opens today about Neale Donald Walsch's rise from homelessness to bestselling New Age author.
 
  I'd ask tough questions just like Walsch (played in two dimensions by Henry Czerny) did when he was homeless in Oregon.
 


         






    With his life at rock bottom, he claimed God started to speak to him. Walsch said he wrote down the Lord's loving and nonjudgmental answers on stacks of yellow legal pads — apparently less cumbersome than stone tablets. And those transcriptions became the "Conversations With God" book series that has sold a reported 7 million copies in 34 languages worldwide.
 
  OK, Lord, now it's time for the questions I jotted down while watching "Conversations."
 
  For starters, since when do you talk like Dr. Phil? Some of your lines of dialogue include: "You are your own rule maker." "If you want to create abundance for yourself, create it for someone else." And "to restrict you would be to deny the reality of who you really are." Seems to me that God can do better than Hallmark — or Tony Robbins. What's up with that?
 
  Another thing: Why didn't the filmmakers stick to Walsch's compelling spiritual rags-to-riches story (the bearded author who once ate out of trash bins promotes himself as an "accidental spiritual messenger") instead of turning it into a feature-length infomercial?
 
  As when his hard-bitten publisher looks him in the eye and says, "You may think I'm old-fashioned, but I think your book can change the world." Then there are the scenes where strangers lavish praise on Walsch, telling him that his book did
 change their world. The only thing missing is an 800 number across the bottom of the screen.
 
  And what's with turning Walsch into a caricature of a modern-day saint while only his supporting actors are left to show any flashes of humanity? Even in small roles, Jerry McGill as the homeless camp's wheelchair-riding landlord and Zillah Glory as a worker Walsch meets on the bus are memorable — and human. But for someone with endless patience and bottomless generosity, the Walsch character comes across as oddly irritating.
 
  Just a couple more questions, Lord. When are the majority of movies with overtly spiritual themes going to rise to industry standards? "Conversations" has all the telltale signs of a religious film that keep your basic moviegoer away: stilted dialogue, overwrought music, the subtlety of a daytime soap.
 
  In the wake of successes such as "The Passion of the Christ" and "The Chronicles of Narnia," aren't you afraid that too many films like "Conversations" will send your flock running in the direction of "Saw III"?
 
  Oh, there's one more thing I've always wanted to know: Why is it that Hollywood can realistically craft entirely new worlds, but it can't make a realistic fake beard?
 
  I'll be waiting for your answers, God, legal pad in hand.

 “Conversations With God,” a feature-length commercial for a popular series of inspirational books, ostensibly depicts the life story of the series’ author, Neale Donald Walsch. Played by the doe-eyed Henry Czerny (joining Stephen Baldwin and Kirk Cameron on the “spiritual cinema” bandwagon), Mr. Walsch is in a car accident, loses his job, cannot return to his family (his multiple divorces are alluded to but not explained) and ends up in a homeless encampment near Medford, Ore.  When another job falls through, Mr. Walsch, though not a drinker, hits bottom. Then, like Paul en route to Damascus, he receives a visitation: it’s God, dictating orations in an archetypal baritone. Mr. Walsch channels it all on paper, and becomes rich.  In his public appearances (his books seemingly ever in the frame), audiences,  bemoaning their oppression for being “spiritual,” applaud him repeatedly. A coda after the closing credits, encouraging divine dialogues in general, does little to dispel the hagiographic aftertaste.  Mr. Walsch’s books have sold millions of copies, and his devotees may flock to this movie. Other seekers of enlightenment  might prefer the 2004 New Age curiosity “What the Bleep Do We Know!?,” whose playful sense of scientific inquiry is refreshing by comparison.  “Conversations With God” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild profanity and mild sexual innuendo. 
Author Neale Donald Walsch  claims to have literally taken dictation from God in answer to some of his own questions, and the New Agey books that resulted have gone on to huge success. But how do you make a movie out of one guy having a dialogue in his head? Stephen Simon 's movie opts to tell the backstory of Walsch, played here by Henry Czerny  under an astonishing variety of fake beards. Injured in a car crash, fired from his job, evicted, unemployable due to age and ailments, he does a stint in a homeless camp before a series of divine coincidences starts propelling him upward again. It's an agreeable enough tale right up until God butts in and starts talking; even if you can swallow the premise, it isn't particularly cinematic to watch a guy endlessly scribbling on legal pads. The rest of the film serves as an infomercial for the book, with every other character tediously going on and on about how amazing it is.
