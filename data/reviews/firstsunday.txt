"First Sunday" is a sorry excuse for a ghetto SOS. Ice Cube and Tracy Morgan play Durell and LeeJohn, two Baltimore buddies who rob a shabby church. They do it for sentimental reasons. Durell is about to lose his son to Atlanta unless he raises the $17,342 needed to keep his ex's beauty shop open. Durell is a bright guy who once had sterling SAT scores. He's a whiz with an air-cooling system, too. But his life has been nothing but baby-momma drama and petty crime. This asinine church scam is LeeJohn's idea, but Durell seizes upon it like a true gangsta, pistols and all.
They hold hostage whoever's around that evening - Olivia Cole, Loretta Devine, Chi McBride, Malinda Williams, Michael Beach, Katt Williams - until someone coughs up the money, which apparently somebody else has already stolen. In the meantime, Cole and Devine love them tender and love them tough. Devine gives Morgan her gold crucifix. (When he cries in her arms, they're the tears of a clown.) Cole gives Ice Cube a lecture on how real dads don't commit felonies for their kids. These good lower-middle-class Christians love the crime right out of two criminals. Jesus saves, indeed.
The comic foolishness (LeeJohn runs screaming from his drag-queen masseur) dares to shine sunlight on a town that could use some. The movie isn't really about Baltimore in the way HBO's "The Wire" is about Baltimore. (For one thing, a lot of this movie's Baltimore looks like Los Angeles and nobody sounds like they're from Maryland.) But like that tremendously perceptive show, whose final season just got underway, "First Sunday" knows something is wrong. Unlike "The Wire," it's lousy and rigged for applause.
In the film's scheme of things, Durell and LeeJohn, with their long rap sheets and short job prospects (they had been sentenced to 5,000 hours of community service even before the church holdup) are the least of the community's woes. And so the movie invests in them - for the neighborhood's future - while finding another, worse villain to scapegoat. (For loaded symbolism, Durell conducts the heist wearing a camouflage hoodie over a baggy T-shirt printed with giant hundred dollar bills.) How Durell got so good at fixing air conditioners without turning that skill into a career is a mystery. It's probably supposed to be a little bit tragic, too.
The adults in this movie are a mess. But the children might have it worse. Durell's son doesn't know what the expression "plan B" means. Another little boy admits he hasn't been taught how to tuck in his shirt. It's enough to break your heart: The kids don't even have good grooming role models.
"First Sunday" is David E. Talbert's feature debut. Talbert is a huge success on the black theater circuit (he says he wants to be the black Neil Simon), and like his stage work, his movie throws together bawdy nonsense with a cup of gospel and a gallon of heart. In the comedy department, he has two chief ingredients. One is Morgan, who, between his work on "30 Rock" and here, has made an art of seeming naturally stupid. The other is Katt Williams, a standup comedian with a pimp shtick. He's very good in movies - his whiny voice, fey mannerisms, and upturned snout are like Prince's rodent cousin. When someone in a courtroom (Keith David plays the ferocious judge) states a fact about Durell and LeeJohn, Williams chimes in: "Miscreants? We are African-American!"
The women - mainly Malinda Williams and the usually hilarious Regina Hall (she's Durell's ex) - don't get to be funny. Maybe because the men are such screw-ups, the job of seriousness monotonously falls to the women. Along with the preacher and the choir, they're willing to heal the brothers holding them at gunpoint, to turn the other cheek and tell the judge there's been a mistake. "American Gangster" cut a similar moral compromise - these guys are bad, but only as bad as the neighborhood that has produced them. Second chances, change, and optimism all around. That is ludicrous. But from the standpoint of social justice, "First Sunday" deems it a necessary message. It wants this community to save itself. That's very Barack Obama. Even if this movie redefines the audacity of hope in the dopiest of ways.

 Ice Cube’s recent movie roles, in the “Barbershop” and “Are We There Yet?” franchises, have emphasized his cuddly, family-man side. In “First Sunday,” which is not  a new installment in the earlier “Friday” series, he departs a bit from the upright-citizen persona, playing a man driven to crime by desperate circumstances.  But “First Sunday,” the first   theatrically released feature film written and directed by David E. Talbert, is a comedy. Like Tyler Perry, Mr. Talbert has had a successful —  and to the white media, nearly invisible —  career as a playwright and theatrical entrepreneur, and his movie debut fuses social observation and raucous, clean humor with a message of redemption.  Ice Cube, not exactly a mirthful performer, requires an antic sidekick, and he has a pretty good one here in Tracy Morgan. Mr. Morgan plays LeeJohn, the feckless stoner half of a hapless pair of robbers. Durell, Ice Cube’s character, is the more  practical half of the team. Because he needs $17,000 to prevent his ex-girlfriend from moving with their son from Baltimore to Atlanta, Durell decides to rob a church.  What kind of person would rob a church? This question occupies most of the movie’s slow, talky middle third, in which an easy in-and-out safecracking scheme turns into a hostage drama. Durell and LeeJohn’s captives include the wise pastor (Chi McBride); his pretty, headstrong daughter (Malinda Williams); a shifty deacon (Michael Beach) and the flamboyantly queeny choir director (Katt Williams), among other easily recognizable church-movie stock figures.  Mr.  Williams pretty much steals the movie by rolling his eyes and muttering under his breath. And if Mr. Talbert does not quite manage the shift in tone from rambunctious comedy to earnest uplift, he is nonetheless generous with both the characters and the audience. “First Sunday” sometimes feels more like a script read-through than like an actual movie, but its warmth is likely to carry you through the stretches of cliché and tedium.    “First Sunday” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild profanity and drug references.

David E. Talbert comes with a legit pedigree similar to that of Tyler Perry, who has found a profitable niche catering to blacks and churchgoing folk with a mix of comedy and spiritual uplift. "First Sunday," Talbert's maiden feature, will test just how starved for entertainment that audience is, as they are forced to muddle through a near-claustrophobic comedy that manages to be both predictable and preachy. Solid actors in supporting roles offer minor redemption, but pic will need the faithful to turn out in numbers to fill theatrical pews.
Ice Cube (who doubles as a producer) and Tracy Morgan co-star as a pair of down-on-their-luck buddies who need cash for different reasons: Durell (Cube) risks losing his son if he can't help support his shrewish ex-wife (Regina Hall), while LeeJohn (Morgan) has gotten into trouble with hoods after a failed attempt to make money selling snazzy wheelchairs.
So after stumbling into a run-down church and seeing the collection plate make the rounds, they hatch a not-very-bright idea: Rob the place. But the plan backfires, triggering a protracted hostage situation with several parishioners, the pastor (Chi McBride), his attractive daughter (Malinda Williams), the wisecracking choir director (comic Katt Williams), the slick deacon (Michael Beach) and the former pastor's widow (Loretta Devine).
Around this point, the movie grinds to a plodding halt, with lots of bickering and yelling, periodically interrupted by tried-and-true sob stories about various characters' pasts.
These flourishes are intended to provide a humanizing, heartwarming streak, but that's virtually impossible given Morgan's grating presence, which, with his mealy-mouthed delivery, proves as annoying as watching a grown man speak baby-talk. At times, Morgan runs his mouth as if he's getting paid by the word. (This tendency also plagues NBC's "30 Rock," but at least there the compensating factors and his limited screen-time make the habit somewhat less irritating.)
What little salvation "First Sunday" can find lies in the casting, from Cube's inherent decency to McBride and Devine's warmth to Olivia Cole in a small role as an elderly parishioner. Those contributions, however, occur more in spite of the hackneyed script than because of it, and the many shortcomings there (including perhaps the most idiotic court scene since "The Bonfire of the Vanities") simply can't be overcome.
Talbert's track record as the architect responsible for more than a dozen plays might very well carry over, and even a modest portion of Perry's congregation would translate into box office success. Even so, sitting through the movie's flabby midsection, there's a nagging sense that it's not just the characters who are being held hostage.

LeeJohn (Tracy Morgan ) is the screw-up/schemey one; Durell (Ice Cube ), the should-know-better buddy. Their latest very awful idea: breaking into a neighborhood church to rob the fundraising pot so that Durell can keep his kid (it's complicated/convoluted). As it happens, the board is meeting that night, the choir's come in for practice, the money turns up missing, and a standoff-cum-whodunit is now underway. Prolific playwright and author David E. Talbert 's first feature starts off as straight ghetto capering, then evolves into an inner-city morality play as a night up-close with church folk offers a lesson in Christian virtue and responsibility. At first, the movie is over-anxioustrying too hard to squeeze out the laughs, pump up the soundtrack, ingratiate itself with the audienceand the straining is abrasive. But once Talbert gets distracted by keeping the plot clunking along, the comedy eases into relaxed sideline banter. The trailers are selling Katt Williams 's supporting bit as a fey choir director hard, but Morgan butchers me every time with that overemphatic- delivery thing that makes incidental lines multiplex-leveling funny. ("Let's take flight!") His couple of earnest dramatic scenes are, I should add, more honestly felt than anything in The Great Debaters .
