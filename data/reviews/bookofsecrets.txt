Can you imagine how dreadful the "National Treasure" movies would be if Nicolas Cage weren't in them? Another star might make the mistake of taking the franchise seriously, whereas Cage cocks his hairpiece, sets his inner ham on stun, and sallies forth to dispense nuggets of US history while jumping over pits of fire. He's alive to the joke of a superhero academic.
"National Treasure: Book of Secrets" is often as noisy, dippy, and enjoyable as 2004's "National Treasure," and when it's not, it's just another sequel, more absurd than most. But absurdity is this series' meat: What other movie would make a lark out of kidnapping the US president? Or try to get us to buy a high-speed car chase in notoriously congested London?
Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer with all spigots open and directed once again by journeyman Jon Turteltaub, the new "National Treasure" sends Benjamin Franklin Gates (Cage) on a fresh scavenger hunt around the monuments of Western Civ. At stake is more than just Cibola, the conquistadors' Lost City of Gold, but the Gates family name. A villainous interloper named Wilkinson (Ed Harris) has come forth with evidence that Ben's great-grandfather led the plot to assassinate Lincoln. Base calumny!
How a chase after treasure will prove the ancestor's innocence is never entirely clear, and anyway the movie's too busy straining to reconvene the troops from the first one: Ben's estranged historian girlfriend Abigail (Diane Kruger), his comic-relief tech specialist Riley (Justin Bartha), professor father Patrick (Jon Voight). The "National Treasure" movies give you two hams for the price of one, and for gravy here's Harvey Keitel replaying his FBI agent with bizarre facial hair and Helen Mirren - the Queen herself - having a high old time as Emily, Ben's mother and Patrick's very divorced ex-wife.
It's the kind of movie where mom's a specialist in ancient Olmec because that's what the plot requires just then. After shopping for clues at the Statue of Liberty in Paris (that's right) and a high-spirited plundering of Buckingham Palace, Ben and company come up with an ancient Native American treasure map, not to mention the novel (and wholly false) tidbit that Queen Victoria sent aid to the Civil War Confederacy.
As in all sequels, the formula has hardened. Ben acts crazy and cross-references historical trivia until he deciphers a clue, the team advances to the next step of the hunt, then there's a rip-snorting action sequence. Rinse, repeat. The only time this varies is during the above-mentioned kidnapping of the president so Ben can get at a clue in the President's Book, a legendary tome containing all the nation's paranoid secrets.
Luckily, the president turns out to be nice old Bruce Greenwood, who played JFK in "Thirteen Days" so he already has more presence than any sitting president you can think of. He's a fan of Ben's work, too, and their relationship is as close to a buddy film as "Book of Secrets" gets. The next "National Treasure," awkwardly set up here, looks to feature this friendship more heavily.
As long as it's galloping along, the movie's perfectly good popcorn - in itself a rarity these days - but eventually you get down to the burnt kernels at the bottom of the bag. Like this one: How on earth did the Olmecs of south-central Mexico come to build a city beneath the Black Hills
 of South Dakota? Or this one: Why can't Harris's character make up his mind and be either a good guy or a bad guy? The film's US history may be right but its GPS is busted and the screenwriting needs an overhaul.
A scene late in the film finds the principals standing precariously on a massive stone teeter-totter above an underground abyss. That about sums it up: Cage and the filmmakers do a fine job balancing this anvil for as long as they can. Eventually it all comes crashing down and we can go home to tend to our happily aching heads.


In the conspiracy-lite, junk-Raiders  knockoff National Treasure: Book of Secrets , one of the few scenes that can pass for witty finds our intrepid hero, Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage), ushering the President of the United States down into an ancient, cobwebby, trick-wall catacomb hidden underneath Mount Vernon. I've been in theme-park haunted houses with much scarier lighting, but the moment works because Bruce Greenwood, who has played the president once before (in the monumental Thirteen Days ), twinkles with the pleasure of high command, especially when he tells Ben about the President's Secret Book. It's a compendium of privileged data  including everything from the missing 18 1⁄2 minutes of Watergate tape to the truth about the Apollo moon missions  that gets passed from each chief executive to the next.
Ben figures that the book might be of help, since he's trying to prove that his great-great-grandfather was a Civil War hero and not, in fact, the man who masterminded a conspiracy to kill Abraham Lincoln. Ben, like the movie, never actually questions the existence of such a plot; he simply wants to clear his relative's name. From the shadow associates of John Wilkes Booth to a hidden pact between Queen Victoria and the Confederacy, Book of Secrets  might best be called a crock of intrigue. Like the first National Treasure  (2004), it's a Styrofoam-cave cliff-hanger posing as a scavenger hunt all dressed up as a Da Vinci Code  version of U.S. history. Yet this film does have a bit more spunk and drive than the first.
Director Jon Turteltaub has fun with Indian glyphs, giant stone pulleys, and an Indy Jones-worthy City of Gold located beneath the rocky shoals of Mount Rushmore. Cage, trying to be light, looks about as gaunt as a Tim Burton ghoul, but he's got a great bit paging through the book of secrets and skipping the part about the JFK assassination because they don't have time. Jon Voight, as Ben's father, and Helen Mirren, as his linguist mom, are touchingly embattled. The movie is about as nourishing as a bowl of trail mix, but it's hard to stop eating. What's next for National Treasure   the Teapot Dome scandal? Los Alamos? The mind boggles, as history trembles.

 Correction Appended  The hyperactive sequel “National Treasure: Book of Secrets” sends its archaeologist hero, Ben Franklin Gates (Nicolas Cage, flexing his deadpan), on a globetrotting quest that might have been devised after a long night of Wikipedia surfing.  Returning characters include Ben’s archaeologist daddy, Patrick Gates (the improbably dignified Jon Voight); Ben’s techie sidekick, Riley Poole (Justin Bartha), who extricates Ben from impossible situations and serves up expository softballs; and Ben’s now-ex-girlfriend, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger), whose dalliance with the press secretary (Ty Burrell) of the president of the United States enables the gang to hunt for clues in the Oval Office.  New faces include Patrick’s ex-wife, Emily Appleton (Helen Mirren), a scholar of ancient languages, who is sly and sexy even while translating pre-Columbian glyphs; and a rival archaeologist and Confederate sympathizer named Mitch Wilkinson (Ed Harris), who brazenly accuses a Gates ancestor, Thomas Gates (Joel Gretsch), of collaborating with Abraham Lincoln’s assassin, John Wilkes Booth.  Booth just happened to shoot Lincoln on the same night that he and a co-conspirator pressured Thomas Gates into translating a diary page that disclosed the location of Cibola, the fabled lost city of gold. To clear the Gates family name, the good guys must prove the existence of Cibola by finding the long-dispersed fragments of a map, one of which is hidden in a compendium of secrets handed down from president to president.  To acquire the cleverly named Book of Secrets, Ben plots to kidnap the current president (Bruce Greenwood) and blah, blah, blah purple monkey dishwasher.  Like its predecessor, “National Treasure,” this sequel amounts to a bunch of crossword puzzle answers stitched together with explosions, chases and displays of intuitive reasoning that the “Twin Peaks” F.B.I. agent Dale Cooper would reject as too right-brained.  Granted, coherence and plausibility matter as much here as they did in the Indiana Jones films and “North by Northwest” (a film whose Mount Rushmore set piece “Book of Secrets” unwisely invokes). But Steven Spielberg and Alfred Hitchcock’s escapist pictures were more than time wasters. They offered dreamily intense predicaments, lived-in relationships (like Indy’s with his estranged father in “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade”), for which the prickly banter of Ben and Patrick is a pale substitute, and action scenes built from dynamic shots that interlocked like stained-glass window panels.  As directed (covered, really) by Jon Turteltaub, the “National Treasure” films substitute trivia for poetry and busyness for thrills. The protracted climax of “Book of Secrets,” set in a dimly lighted, waterlogged Cibola (you thought they wouldn’t find it?), plays like a promotional reel for a forthcoming Disney World attraction. A London car chase that should be nerve-racking is merely noisy.  The best one can say for this franchise is that almost every character is educated and proud of it. Even the brusque Parisian cops who interrupt Ben and Riley’s inspection of the Statue of Liberty in Paris can’t resist joining Ben in a discussion of the Baron de Montesquieu’s role in creating constitutional democracy.  Such eccentricities are welcome, but they can’t approach memories of Indy outrunning a boulder and Eva Marie Saint dangling near George Washington’s face.  “National Treasure: Book of Secrets” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for bloodless violence and mild innuendo.

There is an actual book of secrets buried in "National Treasure: Book of Secrets," and it's not nearly as musty as the script. Graced with some extra star wattage courtesy of Helen Mirren and Ed Harris, this diminishing-returns sequel sends Nicolas Cage on another quest to strike it rich, get young auds excited about history and solve puzzles that are generally less stimulating than yesterday's Sudoku. The 2004 original grossed a surprising $347 million worldwide; with little change to the formula and even more marketing muscle, Disney and producer Jerry Bruckheimer should see their B.O. and homevid coffers flooded anew.
The first "National Treasure" was not without its charms -- namely, an endearingly geeky obsession with clues and codes and a polite aversion to the explosive violence typical of most Bruckheimer-produced actioners. This time around, however, the riddles are conspicuously less clever, the humor more obvious, the stabs at educational value even more perfunctory. Sorry, but having a character tearfully marvel at how the discovery of an ancient city of gold will revolutionize the study of pre-Columbian artifacts doesn't qualify as deep engagement with history.
Opening flashback to President Lincoln's assassination on April 14, 1865, establishes the heroic legacy of Thomas Gates (Joel Gretsch), who was murdered that same evening by a shadowy society of Confederate treasure-hunters. Back in the present day, one Mitch Wilkinson (Harris), so dastardly he speaks with a Southern accent, comes forth with evidence that Gates actually masterminded Lincoln's killing. It's up to professional nerd Ben Gates (Cage) and dad Patrick (Jon Voight) to clear their ancestor's name -- and find the missing gold.
Along the way, the Gateses must endure tiresome comic relief (Justin Bartha, back as tech whiz Riley) and reconcile with their estranged exes -- Ben with blonde bombshell/documents expert Abigail (Diane Kruger), and Patrick with Ben's short-tempered mom, Emily (a plucky Mirren), a professor conveniently well-versed in Native American languages. Soon they're trotting the globe, tearing up cities in high-speed car chases, ransacking national landmarks for hints and exploring subterranean caverns, like the stars of a poor man's "Bourne Ultimatum," "Indiana Jones" and "The Da Vinci Code" all rolled into one.
The characters here don't just solve ciphers; they are
 ciphers, their dialogue and emotional interactions no less mechanical than all the secret switches and hidden compartments (left for them to discover by long-deceased puzzlemeisters who clearly had too much time on their hands). Sole exception is Bruce Greenwood, exuding his usual gravitas as a fictive U.S. president -- an honorable figure who typifies the film's fuzzy nostalgia for simpler, more patriotic times.
With producer-director Jon Turteltaub back at the helm (pic�s five exec producers include original story creators Oren Aviv and Charles Segars), tech package is OK, with flat, functional lensing and nicely underplayed visual effects. Pic's impressive world tour includes stops in Paris, London and Washington, D.C., en route to a climax at Mount Rushmore that won't give "North by Northwest" a run for its money. Product placements are much more assaultive than the action scenes.
