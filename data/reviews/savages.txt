In The Savages , a pair of unhappy, never-married, middle-aged siblings, damaged by and long estranged from their emotionally abusive father, work together to settle that unpleasant parent, now old and unraveling from vascular dementia, in a fluorescent-lit nursing home where he will eventually die. But wait, it gets bleaker: The nursing home is in Buffalo, and it's wintertime, too.
Why, you ask, would anybody seek out such a study in miserabilism for entertainment? Because The Savages  is terrific  a movie of uncommon appreciation for the nature and nurture that go into making us who we are, a perfectly calibrated drama both compassionate and unsentimental. Because as brother and sister Jon and Wendy Savage, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Laura Linney  two of the most focused, natural actors working today  are in peak form, and together they play off each other with the unfettered, joyous collaboration of great chamber musicians. And also because The Savages  is bruisingly funny in the damnedest places, the way life is. Yes, it's okay to laugh. This is a story of stunted adult children and dying elders in which Jon and Wendy's raging and increasingly confused father, Lenny  played by Philip Bosco with huffing dignity  selects The Jazz Singer  when it's his turn to choose at the nursing home's regular movie night, obliviously alienating the predominantly black staff who change his diapers.
Tamara Jenkins, who wrote and directed,  displayed a hard-won appreciation for family craziness as a gift to artists (if not to children) in her sharp, semiautobiographical 1998 feature debut, Slums of Beverly Hills . And nine years more of life's banana peels have only honed her sense of the everyday absurd. Jon, who has cocooned himself in college academia, preaches the gospel of Bertolt Brecht's theater of social realism to his students and can't commit to his Polish girlfriend. Wendy, paying the rent as a temp office worker while she writes plays (about awful families), regularly applies for writing grants that she doesn't get. She also carries on a long, dull affair with a married guy (Peter Friedman, great choice). She tells lies. At one point she steals painkillers from the medicine cabinet of a dead woman.
The Savages   a movie-title family name with adjectival overtones as Jon and Wendy wrestle with guilt  begins in a Disneyfied Arizona senior-citizen community where Lenny has been living for many years in a house owned by his longtime girlfriend. As spry old gals tap-dance to the song ''I Don't Want to Play in Your Yard'' (an oldster's musical touchstone in Reds , too), Jenkins bathes the screen in fake, shiny colors that fade to leaden gray in Buffalo. The end of life, her wise movie consoles, is no easy dance for either the aging or their children, but sometimes a savage wit can do wonders.

 The hands that rock the cradle sometimes tip it over. Watching “The Savages,” Tamara Jenkins’s beautifully nuanced tragicomedy about two floundering souls, you have to wonder if those hands didn’t also knock that cradle clear across the nursery, sending both Savage children into perpetual free-fall.  Certainly Jon Savage, the angry lump played by a brilliant — oh, let’s just cut to it — the brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman, looks like a man who’s taken as much abuse as he likes to deliver. One night, Jon, a college  professor who lives and teaches in Buffalo, is awakened from a deep sleep (Ms. Jenkins has a nice way with metaphor) to discover that his father, Lenny (a fine Philip Bosco), has gone around the bend and has begun finger-painting with his feces. The bearer of these unfortunate tidings is Jon’s younger sister, Wendy (Laura Linney, sharp and vanity free), a self-professed playwright whose greatest, perhaps only creation is the closely nurtured story of wounded narcissism and family wrongs unwinding in her head.  They mess you up, your mum and dad, Philip Larkin  more or less wrote,  which, though it provides steadfast inspiration for poets of all disciplines, has emerged as one of the banes of American independent cinema. At first glance “The Savages,” which had its premiere in January at the Sundance Film Festival, looks like another one of those dreaded indie encounter sessions in which everyone cracks wise and weary on the bumpy road to self-actualization. Ms. Jenkins, whose gifted first feature, “Slums of Beverly Hills,” fired up movie screens and critics nearly a decade ago,  seems incapable of such falsity. I bet she knows the rest of Larkin’s poem, namely, “They fill you with the faults they had/And add some extra, just for you.”  Ms. Jenkins never explains how or why or even if Lenny filled Jon and Wendy with his faults, and what caused his wife, their mother, to run away. She omits the talk-show psychology and instead lets the clues seep through the realistic-sounding snippets and strings of dialogue, through sentences (not speeches), questions (not confessions) and silences as lived in as the story’s recognizably real and revelatory spaces. In Wendy and Jon’s separate if similarly cluttered homes, you can almost see the layers of aspiration and disappointment that have accumulated alongside the dust and the books; in Lenny’s sterile house in Sun City, Ariz.,  you see a man who has not only wiped away his past, but has also erased part of his own self.  In their dyspeptic, quarrelsome fashion, the Savages are blissfully neurotic, often very funny variations on J. M. Barrie’s fictional offspring, John and Wendy Darling, those charmed, magical storybook children. (In their moments of terrifying mutual dependency they can also recall the brother and sister in Jean Cocteau and Jean-Pierre Melville’s “Enfants Terribles.”) If Ms. Jenkins’s middle-age characters have never grown up, in spirit and mind if not in body, it isn’t because they flew off to Neverland in a cloud of fairy dust, but because they did not and could not leave. Yet if Jon and Wendy have stayed locked inside,  Ms. Jenkins also suggests — through an image of flight of surprising force and beauty — that some children find other means of escape, including their imaginations.  Ms. Jenkins doesn’t imply that all that pain is a worthwhile price to pay for imagination, but she acknowledges the paradoxical truth that suffering can also be a source of inspiration, a way out of the childhood room we sometimes call the past. For Jon, who is writing a book on Brecht, and his playwright  sister, life has become something of a performance. Both were probably given a role to play a long time ago — superior brother, resentful sister — and now act out  their parts to perfection. (Jon, who clings to Brecht as if to a baby blanket, is something of a walking alienation effect. ) Jean Renoir once asked, Where does theater end and life begin? Ms. Jenkins seems to answer that question reasonably by saying there is no separation.  It would give away too much to reveal what happens to these distinctly nondarling siblings, whose outbursts and moments of hilarious, often voluble cruelty border on the shrill and the unspeakable. Ms. Jenkins has a gift for family brutality, but she herself isn’t a savage talent. There isn’t a single moment of emotional guff or sentimentality in “The Savages,” a film that caused me to periodically  wince, but also left me with a sense of acute pleasure, even joy. It’s the pleasure of  a true-to-life tale told by a director and actors who’ve  sunk so deep into their movie together you  wonder how they ever surfaced. You live with Jon and Wendy Savage gratefully, even when they can’t always do the same.  “The Savages” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has raw words and open wounds.

The dynamics between two siblings forced together to care for their demented old father are observed wisely and well, and with more than a little humor, in "The Savages." After far too long an absence since her first feature, "The Slums of Beverly Hills," Tamara Jenkins excels more at maximizing individual moments here than at developing a meaty storyline. But a great many of the moments are choice, and with superb performances by Laura Linney and Philip Seymour Hoffman front and center, Fox Searchlight could muster a respectable turnout for a subject not exactly designed to make auds want to drop everything and rush to the cinema. Release date has not yet been set.
Given the numerous scenes rooted in the infirmities of elders at nursing homes and the difficulty of caring for them, there is no doubt many potential viewers will find the material depressing and eminently avoidable as entertainment. Indeed, dementia seems to be the disease of the year at Sundance, as several films focus on older folks facing senility, no doubt a result of the real-life preoccupations of numerous middle-aged writers and directors.
All the same, Jenkins brings a rigor, intelligence and eye for the slightly absurd to the proceedings that is instantly disarming and serves notice that her approach will be far from grim or cloying. Indeed, the ever-so-slightly stylized opening emphasizes the humor inherent in the topography and oldster lifestyle in Sun City, Arizona, 
Residing there is crotchety Lenny Savage (Philip Bosco), who signals he's going over the deep end when he begins writing in feces on the walls of the home he shares with lady friend Doris. When Leonard's two 40ish children, Jon (Hoffman) and Wendy (Linney), rush out from Buffalo and Manhattan, respectively, to tend to the situation, Doris promptly drops dead, leaving the old man in his kids' hands.
In concise, deftly handled scenes, Jenkins and her excellent actors convey reams of information, both explicitly and in subtext, about the characters. 
Wendy is the easier to read, in that she wears her insecurities and dissatisfactions on her sleeve. Her day job pays the bills, but she's still trying to make it as a playwright, and her lack of success is embarrassing in that her intensely intellectual brother is a professor of theater and the author of numerous books, including one in progress on Brecht. Unmarried, she is object of the ardent attentions of perennially horny married neighbor Larry (Peter Friedman), but the affair merely underlines her desperation.
By contrast, the disheveled Jon is well practiced at concealing his emotions, and one of the highlights of Hoffman's performance is how everything about his body language reveals Jon's desire to avoid intimacy with his sister. At first, Jon seems abrupt and too quick in how he deals with delicate matters, and he has other issues weighing heavily upon him, notably his book deadline and the imminent departure of his Polish girlfriend, whose visa is expiring. But despite not making a show of grief or indulging Wendy's notions of how one might ideally behave, Jon without great fuss gets done what needs to be done.
That includes finding a nursing home back in Buffalo where Leonard can see out his days near the kids. Although Lenny settles in without undue fuss, Wendy can't abide the place, and considerable humor spins off her search for a better one.
Pic's midsection possesses little forward momentum but is flecked with mixed-mood scenes that adroitly infuse the drama with the unexpected stuff life throws at you. Among them are the long-avoided conversation with Dad about what to do "when something happens," a talk with his sister Jon simply can't avoid because he's immobilized by a chin sling attached to a door, a wonderful interlude in which Lenny shows "The Jazz Singer" on movie night because it reminds him of his childhood neighborhood but that becomes embarrassing to black and white viewers alike when Al Jolson slaps on blackface, and a couple of intimate chats Wendy has with a friendly Nigerian worker (Gbenga Akinnagbe) at the nursing home, who imparts an interesting tidbit on how the staff know who will die soon.
Perhaps best of all are the quiet, private moments, as when Wendy, lying awake at night, overhears her normally rational brother crying while on the phone to his Polish paramour, or the care with which Jon carefully redistributes the mess in his home to accommodate Wendy when she comes to stay, in a way that suggests he really does know where everything is.
Script adroitly catches how two drama-steeped siblings might speak to one another--facing the Arizona trip, Jon reassures his sister, "We are not in a Sam Shepard play." 
Both actors are completely credible as the sorts of writers they are. Each perf is the flip side of the other: Hoffman's professor moves from seeming to be at the end of his rope to having more control and competence than expected, while Linney's still-aspiring writer must come to grips with her across-the-boards unrealized potential. It's a wonderful match-up of performances.
Supporting turns also provide ample pleasure, notably those of Bosco as the father and Akinnagbe as the amiable care-giver.
After the bold, parched vistas of the Arizona opening, pic is enshrouded in a dismal Buffalo winter, which provides a measure of humor in itself. Musical choices and tech contributions are discreetly polished.

Simmering below the squeamish elder-care euphemism "uncharted territory" is a fearful awareness that when it comes to dealing with the growing army of senile parents, we have no idea what the hell we're doing. Tamara Jenkins  plumbs the depths of that terror in her new film, The Savages , and jacks it up a few notches by asking what it's like to care for a demented father who never cared for you.
It's hard to imagine a more potent test of family solidarity than the decision-making process regarding what to do with a sick and helpless relative. Some rally heroicallyin a moving instance of life mimicking Away From Her , former Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor  recently gave an understanding thumbs-up to the romance between her Alzheimer's-afflicted husband and a woman in his nursing home. But many collapse under the strainand if you saw Jenkins's heavily autobiographical 1998 cult-hit comedy Slums of Beverly Hills  , you won't be expecting serene self-sacrifice from Wendy and Jon Savage  (Laura Linney  and Philip Seymour Hoffman ), middle-aged siblings whose relationship with one another and their fast-fading dad Lenny (Philip Bosco ) strains the very definition of family, never mind adulthood.
An instinctive provocateur, Jenkins gleefully rubs the more graphic symptoms of dementia in our facesas well she should, given the emotional fallout of dealing with a man who covers a bathroom wall with his own feces. But the movie also comes with the wistful sadness of a maturing filmmaker who understands that in matters of death, sorrow and black comedy often walk hand in hand. The Savages  opens under insanely blue skies in the retirement village of Sun City , Arizona, with a bunch of senior ladies capering about in electric-blue cheerleading outfits, a scene of pure goofiness slyly offset on the soundtrack by a plaintive Peggy Lee  singing "I Don't Want to Play in Your Yard"an unadorned anthem to human neediness in general and sibling rivalry in particular. Estranged from their overbearing father and a mother who checked out early, Jon and Wendy delude themselves into believing that they've cut the family cord and moved on with their lives. In reality, Wendy's  a stalled East Village  playwright (a/k/a temp) wasting her time in an affair with her married neighbor, while Jon, a Buffalo college professor who cranks out pomo-lit papers no one will ever read, refuses to marry his Polish girlfriend even though he weeps when she makes him eggs. Trapped in extended adolescence, the two rattle around their separate but equally cramped lives, which grow a slight more cramped when a nocturnal phone call informs Wendy that Dad has flunked out of his retirement home.
Chickens flap home to roost as Wendy and Jon move their recalcitrant father to a dreary East Coast facility, where he confounds their every effort to take instruction from Elder Care for Dummies . Bosco gives a hilariously physical performance, but at its core The Savages  is about a brother and sister who have been hopelessly failed in the parenting department, and misbehave accordingly. Linney has always been a natural at playing tightly wound women on the verge, and there's something inexpressibly moving about watching her child-woman in ringlets come apart as she overcompensates for her withdrawn brother and lies through her teeth to upstage him. Watching their father die, the pointedly named Savages make a perfectly synchronized emotional seesaw: a rabid squirrel trying to get a rise out of a grumpy bear.
Jenkins is no sentimentalist, and she won't patronize her benighted losers or her audience with epiphanies, apologies, or blinding insights. Yet the movie is dotted with moments of grace and whacked-out humor that got me on board for this damaged duo's liberation. Theirs is a hesitant growing up that feels less like a sop to distributors wary of the bummer ending than a goofy act of tender mercy by a director who's moved on from the simple desire to shock.
