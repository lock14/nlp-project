Fans of horror, thrillers, and the films of Sandra Bullock will find "Premonition" puzzling since it fails to honor any of them.
Instead, it's a movie only a psychic could love, since a psychic would know to stay home or see "Zodiac" instead. The rest of us? Well, we wanted to be scared for Sandra, knowing that she'd be playing a woman who wakes up in different, non-sequential days of the week and that on some days her blandly handsome husband (Julian McMahon ) would be dead. But from the first scene, Bullock looks dead herself. Maybe she knows she'll be upstaged by a musical score and sound effects that can't wait to go crazy around her, which they do for pretty much the entire movie.
The morning after hearing that her husband was killed in a car crash -- day two of her shuffled life -- Bullock walks slowly (always very slowly
) into the kitchen, as the music explodes and the camera stares at a pillar with a man behind it. The screeching orchestrations are meant to signify that something shocking is about to be revealed. But the shock is only that the screenwriter, Bill Kelly, and the director -- Mennan Yapo , a German making his Hollywood debut -- think they have one in store for us. Who, other than the husband, did they believe we would expect to see behind that pillar? (OK, my money was on Keanu Reeves, but still.)
Every morning Bullock wakes up and remembers the previous day's events and slowly begins to piece together that she's in a relentlessly stale copy of "Groundhog Day." Her mother (Kate Nelligan ) and her only friend (Nia Long) conspire to have her institutionalized. Amber Valletta plays someone harboring a hokey secret about Bullock's marriage. And after one of her two little daughters runs through a glass door, a dead crow is stumbled upon, and Lithium is prescribed, Bullock turns to a priest who tells her she needs to believe in something greater than herself. But the last thing anybody wants from a horror-thriller, let alone from a Sandra Bullock movie, is a lecture on faithlessness.
Since it won't -- or can't -- scare, "Premonition" opts to moralize. This would be tolerable if the moral weren't such a joke, and the movie weren't such a cynical, suspenseless slog. Bullock doesn't seem remotely interested in being here, anyway. This is a case of a star forgetting what an audience loves to see her do. If she found comedies too confining, schlock seems to box her in too, just as it did for Jim Carrey in "The Number 23." Bullock doesn't lower herself to embarrassing material the way, say, Julianne Moore gamely can. Bullock chooses to give virtually no performance at all. The nasally sarcasm she uses so effectively in her comedic work turns petulant and defensive here. It's as if her new default setting for seriousness is that nasty woman she played in "Crash."
There are occasional moments where Bullock seems to be in on some cosmic joke, like when she mutters a hilarious quip to McMahon about how tomorrow he could be dead. A movie this stupid requires a star willing to tell us she knows what's up in pretty much every scene. Instead, Bullock sucks the life out of whatever kick this movie might have had. In her defense, few stars could have redeemed the oppressive contraptions of the script or the illogic of the filmmaking. Maybe she thought that she, too, could wake up and this movie would never have happened. If so, that would make two of us.


         That sinking feeling you had seeing the trailer for "Premonition" will get worse only if you take the bait and see the movie. Its biggest failing — and the ultimate one for a lightweight entertainment such as this — is that it's a deadly bore from start to finish. Even more annoying is its blind-alley structure resulting in an unsatisfying mind game for the audience.
 
 Sandra Bullock stars as Linda Hanson, an unhappily married woman, moping through her daily routine of housework and providing shuttle service to her two young daughters. Linda's generically chilly relationship with her husband, Jim, (an uncharacteristically bland Julian McMahon) gets a jolt (for better or worse) when she learns he has been killed in an auto accident.
 


         






   The meltdown doesn't really kick in until the next morning, when Linda seemingly awakens to discover that Jim is very much alive. Writer Bill Kelly and director Mennan Yapo begin playing with time at this point, cracking the temporal whip so as Linda is unsure exactly what is going on. Her days are ostensibly occurring in a random order that shreds logic. It's as if she loaded her calendar onto an iPod and hit shuffle. Is she going crazy? Is someone trying to make her think she's crazy? Should we call in Mulder and Scully?
 
 Unfortunately, our desire to discover the answers to these questions is our only reason to continue watching. The filmmakers let everything ride on a concept that demands a big payoff but comes up empty in the end.
 
 If the journey were more engaging, as with "Groundhog Day," or as challenging as "Memento," it wouldn't matter so much that the ending is such a letdown. If the film more fully explored the terror of aloneness or the fragility of relationships and the impact our emotions have on our perception of those around us, there might be enough substance to sustain our interest.
 
 There's a portentous quality to Yapo's direction that hints at psychological horror, but it's paced as if it's a prestige drama rather than the genre hash it turns out to be. Bullock isn't bad, but there's a restraint to her performance that doesn't serve her or the picture well. There is a brief sequence late in the film where her character displays feistiness and begins muttering asides in response to her predicament, but it's too little, too late.
 
 Time is a great cinematic device and when employed to its maximum benefit can be a magical thing. But when it's used strictly to distract from the fact that the emperor has no clothes, it's simply 97 minutes you will never get back.
 
 
 "Premonition." MPAA rating: PG-13 for some violent content, disturbing images, thematic material and brief language. Running time: 1 hour, 37 minutes. In general release.   

Movies like Memento , told backward, are so six years ago. Premonition  complicates it all by throwing the whole calendar week out of order. One day a woman finds out that her husband has died in a car accident; the next morning she wakes up and he's alive, ready to drive their two daughters to school. Next days, same mess: He's alive, he's dead, he's alive, he's dead, the kids are okay, or maybe they're not. Is it true that this loving, sad-eyed wife (Sandra Bullock) can see a terrible day coming where her perfect mate (Nip/Tuck 's Julian McMahon) smashes up on the road? Can she alter the future? Is she crazy? Or is she just being made to feel  crazy by those four standard messengers of feminine destabilization  her increasingly distracted man, her vaguely infantilizing mother (Kate Nelligan), her possibly unreliable best friend (Nia Long), and her nefarious-looking shrink (Peter Stormare)? And what's up with the priest she consults: Is he part of the solution or part of the problem as he offers the toothless, non-sectarian counsel that ''faith is believing in something beyond yourself''?
One piece of advice in trying to make sense of it all: Follow the sleepwear, since Bullock cycles through a few garments that clarify which day is which. Another suggestion? Ignore the two-bit psychological and spiritual doggerel with which screenwriter Bill Kelly (doing the time warp again after 1999's Blast From the Past ) tries to deepen the meaning of the game. Concentrate instead on the picture's interesting moments of art-house visual style, especially where Turkish-German director Mennan Yapo and his cinematographer, Torsten Lippstock, zoom in on Bullock's empathic, Everywoman beauty, employing tight, caressing close-ups to convey the character's confusion and vulnerability. Then prepare for some hoary genre clichés: mourners huddled at a graveside service, the widow spying a mysterious woman behind a cemetery tree, and, of course, the part where a car explodes into really big Michael Bay flames. And that's about all there is to know about Premonition , especially if you normally wouldn't give time travel the time of day.

 Blind faith that all will be revealed can keep you glued to a movie long after the arrival of that sinking feeling that none of what you’re seeing can possibly add up. As you watch “Premonition,” a psychological thriller that scrambles time in the life of a desperate housewife, you imagine that the director, Mennan Yapo, and the screenwriter, Bill Kelly, must have some notion of where they’re heading, so you suspend your doubts, invest your emotions and go along for the ride. After all, aren’t these Hollywood professionals who know something about storytelling? And didn’t a major star (Sandra Bullock) sign on to the project?  The movie seems to be headed in several possible directions. Is it a supernatural “Gaslight”? A Hitchockian psychological mystery like “Marnie” or “Vertigo”? An M. Night Shyamalan party trick with a jack-in-the-box ending? None of the above, it turns out.  The sloppy, absent-minded “Premonition” is a giant step backward for Ms. Bullock, who plays Linda Hanson, a woman with a perfect home, a perfect husband and two young daughters. Linda’s world suddenly crashes around her when the local sheriff knocks on the door and tells her that her husband, Jim (Julian McMahon), has died on a business trip when his car was hit by a truck.  Grief settles over the Hanson household. Linda gently breaks the news to her daughters, Bridgette (Courtney Taylor Burness) and Megan (Shyann McClure). And her mother, Joanne (Kate Nelligan), and best friend, Annie (Nia Long), rush to her side to flutter around offering solace.  But when Linda wakes up the next morning, she goes downstairs to find Jim contentedly sipping coffee and watching television. His death must have been a dream, she concludes. Soon after that she wakes to find the living room filled with anxious mourners. There is a spilled bottle of lithium in her bathroom sink. But the following morning she finds Jim in the shower. Is she losing her mind? After some tentative sleuthing, she decides that through a temporal mix-up, she has learned of Jim’s imminent death before it takes place.  The story brings in an ominous psychiatrist, Dr. Norman Roth (Peter Stormare), whom Linda has consulted but can’t remember; enigmatic answering-machine messages; and Jim’s blond co-worker Claire (Amber Valletta), who shows up at his burial and looks suspiciously like the Other Woman. There is some shady-seeming business involving Jim’s recently jiggered life insurance.  The movie veers toward horror, with Linda eventually dragged kicking and screaming to a mental hospital. Later, after we learn that the Hansons’ marriage has been in unspecified trouble for some time, the movie takes a turn toward the spiritual, with Linda consulting a priest who regales her with mumbo-jumbo about how her confusion stems from a lack of faith.  With a dozen loose strands still dangling at the two-thirds mark, “Premonition” abandons the psychiatric subplot to become a simple melodrama in which Linda, who has pieced together a timeline of past and future events, dashes to the scene of Jim’s accident to try to prevent it.  Ms. Bullock, who proved she could act in “Crash” and “Infamous,” returns to nonacting in “Premonition.” Embodying a paranoid but plucky Everywoman clutching at an elusive mate while trying to maintain her sanity, the best Ms. Bullock can manage is to seem glumly opaque.  Mr. McMahon, with his Mephistophelean eyebrows, dead eyes and slack mouth, walks the same line between Mr. Right and Mr. Wrong as his character, Dr. Christian Troy, does in the cable series “Nip/Tuck.” All he has to do to suggest sinister motives is to twist his features into a sour expression and address his wife in a blasé tone. Even in his Mr. Right mode, you’d be an idiot to trust him for a millisecond.  “Premonition” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild sexual situations and some strong language. 

One of the current stars most savvy about her constituency, Sandra Bullock ventures into supernatural suspense with too much demographically targeted care in "Premonition." Very redolent of "The Sixth Sense," "Memento" and other bendings of time/reality into contrived puzzles, this slick exercise about a housewife whose spouse might or might not be dead is effective until a downright maudlin close, as if chicks might not withstand a horror pic (which PG-13 tale barely qualifies as) sans sniffling embrace of family values. Nonetheless, combined Bullock and genre lure should propel strong mid-level B.O.
First flashback sequence shows Jim Hanson (Julian McMahon) surprising wife Linda (Bullock) with a 1920s wood-frame house that -- though she worries they can't afford it -- is now theirs. A decade later, Linda is a full-time housewife and mother of 10-year-old Bridgette (Courtney Taylor Burness) and 6-year-old Megan (Shyann McClure). All appears to be well, until a policeman visits Linda with news that Jim, who was on a business trip, died in a car accident the day before.
Traumatized, Linda recovers enough in the short term to prepare her girls for bad news once they're home from school. She calls her own mother (Kate Nelligan) and best friend (Nia Long) over for comfort before finally curling up to sleep on a couch.
Linda wakes up in the morning in her bed. She goes downstairs -- and discovers Jim routinely drinking coffee. Apparently, it was all a bad dream.
Only the "next" morning, Linda wakes up to find her husband is very much dead again -- a wake taking place downstairs, mom and best friend presiding. Her protest, "He's not dead," is taken for grief-stricken mental instability.
Then comes the next morning, and the next. It's not spoiling anything to reveal what Linda eventually discovers: Time has somehow become unstuck, and she's experiencing the week of her husband's fatal accident in randomly reshuffled "before" and "after" days. Tension centers on whether she can prevent Jim's demise.
En route, we discover the Hansons' marriage maybe wasn't so perfect (though its flaws are poorly defined); that Jim was considering an extramarital affair (with Amber Valletta as a sexy coworker); and that time-warped Linda's understandably confused responses to her post-Jim circumstances will have serious consequence for herself and her children.
"Premonition" owes everything to the school of chronology-and-reality-messing suspense. Bald imitation can have its charms -- and this exercise is involving enough as long as Linda's struggling to figure out what's happened to her world.
A curious choice given his prior experience writing, producing, directing and acting in films of modest international repute, Turkish-German director Mennan Yapo's English-language feature bow is glossily pro, but lacks assertive directorial personality. Stronger style and atmosphere would have greatly benefited a pic that seems to abandon its own supernatural aspects to sheer plot mechanism.
Nor is the always watchable Bullock up to limning more than the most feet-on-ground elements of a character whose possible insanity (or at least marital dissatisfaction) should be milked for as much ambiguity as possible. (Offering a master class in sustaining such tensions was Nicole Kidman as the good/bad mother in 2001's "The Others.")
As "Crash" proved, Bullock can do dislikable. Enigmatic complexity? Maybe not. Her straightforward playing renders simply off-key some of the script's odder ideas, as when Linda realizes Jim was thinking
 about cheating on her, and her grief over his demise abruptly turns into something like grim satisfaction.
But where "Premonition" really stumbles is in the last reel, when Linda seeks comfort from a priest who suggests her problems are due to lack of (ever-so-vaguely, non-denominationally specified) "faith," though there's been no prior evidence she lacks it. Closing gush of family-values affirmation feels false in both emotive and plot-logic terms.
Supporting perfs, production and tech values are all polished if undistinguished. Pic was shot in Shreveport, La., though setting comes off as generic.

The space-time continuum smacks the shit out of Sandra Bullock  in Premonition , the latest in nonlinear nonsense, but the fun really gets going when she starts to smack back. As Linda Hanson , humdrum mom of Anywhere, U.S.A., Bullock sets things up by doing her thing, effortlessly establishing the girl next door (to the loony bin, as we shall see). With a pair of adorable daughters and her handsome husband, Jim (Julian McMahon ), she seems the happiest of campers, so when later developmentsthere will be ever so many of themrequire us to think her a complacent ingrate, bored with the comforts of her middle-class cocoon, it doesn't quite parsewhich is, I suppose, par for the crazy course of the movie.
One sunny afternoon Linda opens her door to a police officer bearing news that Jim has been horribly mangled in a car accident. Rising from a black night's sleep, she wobbles to the kitchen only to find Jim very much alive, nonchalantly non-mangled, eating a bowl of cereal. Whew, thinks she, gnarliest dream ever, and the day goes by more or less swimmingly. Next morning Linda wakes to find a bottle of lithium in her bathroom, a funeral assembly in her living room, Jim re-mangled, and her eldest daughter ominously posed on a swing set, her face a Frankenstein mess of fresh scars and stitches.
Where am I? Who am I? What day is it? WTF? My sister! My daughter! Wagh! And so it begins, a world tied up in knots, each day darting in and out the black hole of Jim's demise, as Linda is dragged hither and yon through space and time by the brain-twisting whims of . . . the number 23!
Actually, her reality has been hijacked by an imp of the perverse named Bill Kelly , practitioner of the dark arts of Screwy Screenwriting. Directed with loopy sincerity by Mennan Yapo , Premonition  strings up its heroine in a temporal torture apparatus and watches her squirm. There is, for example, a spooky shrink played by Peter Stormare  who commits Linda to an institution one day, then listens patiently the "next" as she pays visit to his office for the first time, having located him via the lithium bottle, which, of course, he has yet to prescribe. "Obviously," notes the doctor, "you're dealing with some inconsistencies."
Tell me about it. You might need to watch Premonition twice to fully sort out its helter-skelter hijinks, though once is more than enough for all other purposes. Yet the real surprise of this chick-flick mindfuck is that once is almost worth itthough not for the bird-brained message about appreciating life, and definitely not for the suggestion that Linda's limbo was triggered by a lack of faith. As an exercise in "the new cinematic disorder," as David Denby  recently trademarked the trend of flagrant nonlinearity, Premonition  may lack the suavity of Babel , but it also escapes from its mirthless pretense and gloomy self-regard. Closer in spirit to the schlocky kicks of Déjà Vu,  it's a B-level entry in the cracked-continuity genre, with a winningly humble, workmanlike vibe; a poor-man's puzzle picture with a heart of goldOK, maybe pyriteand a glinting sense of humor, not all of which may be intentional.
"If I let Jim die, is that the same as killing him?" Linda wonders in a moment of delicious perplexity. Deep in the sludge of her metaphysical mindfuck, she has unearthed the details of an affair, unconsummated, between Jim and a co-worker (Amber Valletta ). Self-awareness is the thread through the Premonition labyrinth, and the movie kicks into gear when Linda grabs it and yanks. Exhaustion gives way to exasperation as she digs into her existential mess and gets organized, plotting the scramble of events and clues on a large desk calendar and running around town putting the pieces together.
Bullock's affable performance starts strong then muscles up as a faint but lifesaving strain of humor creeps into the material. Otherwise hackneyed, Premonition finds a new groove in this middle stretch as Linda goes from beleaguered to what can only be described as slightly peeved. Had the film maintained a tone of kooky, Kafkaesque tragicomedy, narrowing in on Linda's wacko wrestling match with the laws of physics, we might really have had something here. I'd kill to watch girlfriend whip out a Palm Treo  and start calculating vectors of the vortex.
That's the Premonition  Richard Kelly might have made; Yapo, alas, is of more pedestrian intelligence, but he isn't dumba bit goofy, yes, but not dumb. He wisely leaves the explanation hanging. Linda may be having a premonition, she may be mad, or this may all be an elaborate form of catharsis leaking into a mind cracked from trauma. What it is not, finally, is connected to any persuasive moral or emotional core, though it does resolve with a denouement at once tougher and sappier than expected.
