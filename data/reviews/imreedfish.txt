 Sweetness and whimsy fill the screen to capacity in "I'm Reed Fish," a rural coming-of-age tale that's so laid-back that its cast is almost horizontal. Set in the fictional town of Mud Meadows — a cross between Stars Hollow and Lake Wobegon — this movie is about a guy who makes a movie about his life. Moreover, it was written by the real Mr. Fish, drawing from events in his own life. Try to stay with me now.  Our small-town hero (played by Jay Baruchel) is a gangly young man at that difficult stage between about-to-be-married and calling-it-off. Shuffling back and forth between his serene fiancée (Alexis Bledel) and a sunny singer-songwriter (Schuyler Fisk), Reed can barely concentrate on his daily radio show. Meanwhile his folksy listeners are irritated by his escalating distraction. Who will help them with their shrubbery regulations?  Filled with painfully awkward men with painfully bad haircuts, "I'm Reed Fish" is directed by Zackary Adler, exhibiting less energy than a sloth on Seconal. As the young man fearful of living an old man's life, Mr. Baruchel recalls John Turturro in his Barton Fink incarnation: all bones and aching eyes. Yet not even Mr. Fink would dither so gracelessly between the girl in the hand and the one he can't get out of his head.  "I'm Reed Fish" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mild language and the bizarre offspring of a zebra and a horse.

With this charming, rural version of a pre-wedding panic, tyro scripter Reed Fish and neophyte helmer Zachkary Adler have crafted a whimsical coming-of-ager in "I'm Reed Fish" that feels genuinely regional in a laid-back Mark Twain/Prairie Home Companion vein. Lanky, somewhat ungainly Jay Baruchel (in the title role) and his talented young cohorts move flawlessly in tune to small-town rhythms. Pitch-perfect dialogue, quietly dynamic helming and small-scale action on a widescreen canvas make for a very appealing film that has real commercial possibilities. 
Reed's local radio program of neighborhood doings and cracker-barrel philosophy, a folksy legacy of his late father, makes him the voice and communications hub of his hometown of Mud Meadows, a fictional small town in the U.S. Aided by station manager/cameraman Frank (Victor Rasuk), he hosts a similar TV show. 
Reed is about to marry Kate (Alexis Bledel), the local beauty, whom he has known since childhood. But when old friend Jill (Schuyler Fisk), an aspiring songwriter, returns from college and blows him away with her music, Reed begins to question his choices of career and marriage partner, much to the consternation of the townsfolk.
Midway through the proceedings, the filmmakers reveal the pic so far is actually a film-within-a-film, Reed evidently having decided to leave radio and TV for 16mm autobiography. But the illusion of small-town life is so strong -- and virtually everyone appearing in the film is also attendant in the film-within-the-film -- that the viewer slips right back into the fiction, accepting the plot twist as a further example of homegrown ingenuity rather than as a breakdown of the film's fictional premise.
Pic's power lies not in postmodernism but in its take on how rural youths relate to the contemporary scene. Mud Meadows is presented as being very much part of the 20th century, if not quite up to the 21st; Reed's pal and also a fellow groom Andrew (a wonderfully goofy DJ Qualls), who is hung up on martial arts and Chuck Norris, triumphantly high-fives his bride at the altar. 
Well-known cast of young pros appears downright indigenous. 
Pic's unsentimental immersion in the rural pace, textures and rituals is well served by Doug Chamberlain's 'scope lens. Other tech credits are excellent, with Schuyler Fisk's music effective.

Short of pulling a Zach Braff , there's one sure way to get known as a screenwriter: Put your actual name in the title of the script. Add a bunch of indie bands, find a Braff look-alike (Jay Baruchel ) to play the lead, top it off with some obscure animal hybrida zorse instead of a ligerand you've got writer Reed Fish 's can't-fail debut. The semi- fictional character Fish, with both parents dead in a car accident, looks set to follow in his father's footsteps: take over the small-town radio show"the voice of Mud Meadows"that his dad hosted for years, marry the local hottie (Alexis Bledel ), and settle in to a life of babymaking, bowling, and Dance Dance Revolution . But wait! Cue the old high school flame (Schuyler Fisk ), back from college and casting her indie-folk spell to "hook the Fish." And just so you know this Fish has got chops, there's a flashy Brechtian film-within-a-film conceit, showing Fish (still played by Baruchel) making his film and even, for a moment, substituting his real girlfriends (or are they?!?) for their on-screen doubles. Because irony fixes everything.
