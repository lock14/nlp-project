Woody Allen's previous film, Match Point
, seemed to signal a rebirth of sorts for the aging auteur. Apart from the opening credits, Allen's signature style was absent, save for thematic similarities to his brilliant Crimes and Misdemeanors
, and the film itself was as taut and involving as any thriller in years. Allen attributed the breath of fresh air to a change of settings (New York to London) and to his discovery of a new muse in actress Johansson. Judging from his follow-up, Scoop
, the novelty of these elements wore off quickly. Allen's second British film with Johansson finds the director falling back into the rut he carved for himself with every forgettable comedy since the underrated Deconstructing Harry
. Unlike Match Point
, his fingerprints here are apparent from the first scene, during which recently deceased journalist Joe Strombel (McShane) rides a Grim Reaper-driven boat to the afterlife. Bored, Strombel makes small talk with the victim of a notorious London serial killer and discovers that the murderer is likely famous playboy Peter Lyman (Jackman). Strombel is livid: The story of the year just fell into his lap, but he can't pursue it. Not to be dissuaded, he jumps off the boat and manages to materialize in front of a plucky young journalism student, Sondra Pransky (Johansson). At the moment, she is volunteering in a magic show put on by neurotic illusionist Sid Waterman (Allen). Strombel's ghost shares the tip and demands that Pransky and Waterman find the evidence to write an article exposing the criminal. Once she meets the charming Lyman though, Pransky finds herself falling for him. Johansson's performance as a naive college student is a stretch, and while Jackman tries hard, he can't overcome the fact that his part only exists to serve the plot. Allen puts forth an inspiring amount of energy, but he's certainly not breaking new ground with this caricature that he's played many times before. However, Allen executes the screwball setup with impeccable comic timing, and the murder-mystery plot unfolds with the same subversion of audience expectations that made the third act of Match Point
 such a nail-biter. Still, it all feels inconsequential. There are plenty of opportunities for Allen's acute philosophical musings on death, love, and fate, but he aims only for laughs. Often, he gets them, especially in several scenes in which Waterman pretends to be Pransky's rich father at cocktail parties. But Scoop
 suffers from the same problem as much of Allen's recent work: Even when the witty banter clicks, it seems stale. In fact, it often seems possible that Allen already used some of the jokes verbatim in one of his three dozen previous films. Years ago, when Allen's inimitable comedy style still seemed fresh, Scoop
 may have joined the ranks of Sleeper
 and Take the Money and Run
 as a comedy classic. Today it provides a pleasant diversion, but will likely be forgotten by most along with other recent efforts like Small Time Crooks
 and Curse of the Jade Scorpion
.


Even those of us who weren't wholly enthralled with last year's ``Match Point " had to acknowledge that Woody Allen had found his second wind -- that relocating to England and hiring A-list talent had recharged the filmmaker's creative batteries. He even seemed interested in real people again. The news that the 70-year-old director would stay on in London and retain Scarlett Johansson for a comedy held out hope that the comeback would stick and perhaps deepen, and that the old Woody -- engaged, wise, profoundly funny -- would somehow emerge from the carapace of his recent work.
No such luck, it saddens me to report. ``Scoop" is distinctly minor Allen, with less weight to it than one of his old humor doodles in The New Yorker. A fluffy, fatally implausible farce about an American journalism student given the scoop of a lifetime by a deceased reporter, the movie's hard to hate but impossible to work up any enthusiasm over. It wants to be an effervescent summer cooler, but the tonic's gone flat.
Johansson plays the journalism student, Sondra Pransky , a Brooklyn naif with owlish glasses and a zeal that's alternately adorable and dunderheaded. In town visiting friends, she's visited by the ghost of a recently expired Fleet Street reporter, the storied Joe Strombel (Ian McShane ), who has picked up a nugget of news from a fellow passenger (Fenella Woolgar ) on the slow boat across the River Styx.
The scoop is this: The dreaded Tarot Card serial killer may be none other than Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman ), the dashing businessman son of Lord Lyman (Julian Glover ). ``Get the story first, but first get the story right," instructs the shabby shade. Unfortunately, he doesn't offer any advice about falling in love with your quarry.
Sondra happens to be onstage in a magician's disappearing-act box when Joe appears to her, and the magician in question is a schlump named Sidney Waterman (Allen), a.k.a. The Great Splendini , apparently a first cousin to Broadway Danny Rose . At first dismissive of the girl's story, he's soon brought around, and ``Scoop" becomes a comedy of ill manners as Sidney tails Sondra on her investigations, pretending to be her eccentric moneybags father.
The argumentative byplay between these two is more hectic than funny, although Allen can't help getting off a good line now and then. (Addressing a swank London crowd at a party: ``I was born into the Hebrew persuasion, but I converted to Narcissism.") More often than not, the shtick and the stammer are wearying ends in themselves, and you realize that Sidney would have no earthly reason to be here if the director weren't playing him. The sad fact is that a Woody Allen movie with Woody Allen in
 it has become an occasion for dismay.
Nor is it remotely believable that Peter, a titled and class-conscious Brit, would be dazzled by this gauche American beyond a quick roll in the hay, even if she is played by Scarlett Johansson. Without a character to portray, Jackman thus has little to do but smile and look handsome, which he does surpassingly well. A department store dummy might have been cheaper, though.
Friendly and very inconsequential, the film's essentially ``Match Point" turned inside out and shaken for laughs. That's not a terrible idea, but what is it about young women threatened with grievous bodily harm that fascinates this director? The film skates gaily along Allen's obsessions without investigating them; you'd think a lifetime on the couch would have yielded something
, but the human insights of ``Annie Hall " and ``Hannah and Her Sisters " have never seemed further off.
Instead, Allen lavishes his camera on his female star, which may be creepy but is also a long-established filmmaker's prerogative. Johansson dives happily into her role here, making Sondra a sensuous screwball pain in the neck -- the sort of lovely American idiot who saves the day without knowing why. (The character's also a bit of a roundheel , falling into bed with older men on a rapturous whim. You wish, Woody.)
You can assume this kind of humor goes over well with the Europeans who are the director's financial backers and primary audience these days. Like Charlie Chaplin in his final years, Allen has found refuge in exile, far from the US audiences who have turned their backs on him (because we're lowbrow slobs or because his movie have stopped being very good; your call). When we see him onstage as The Great Splendini, Allen even eerily resembles Chaplin in ``Limelight ," shyly smiling out at the audience with the comedian's eternal hope of unconditional love. Does he see anything besides the beautiful young woman and himself? Sweet and woebegone, ``Scoop" says no.


         If Woody Allen were a painter, a lot of his movies could be classified as studies for works in progress. "Scoop" feels like a tentative doodle in the general direction of "Match Point," only chronologically reversed and more or less amusing. A murder mystery in the vein of "Manhattan Murder Mystery," the action unfolds in London, in the crispiest parts of its upper crust. It's all very civilized and cozy, which is good because the jokes, God help them, are so ancient and creaky you're compelled to offer them your seat. (No, really, it's no trouble at all.)
 
 The analogy also applies because Allen is a good example of how success is defined in the art world: Do something surprising and zeitgeist-y early in your career, then rip yourself off forever. (Allen, who has been around for a very long time, has reached the point where he's also allowed to rip off others.) Whatever fresh cultural nerves his comedy touched 30 years ago have long limped off into the sunset. By now, it's branding. Even as you laugh, you half wonder what you're laughing at when you titter as Allen stammers, "You're a beautiful human being and a credit to your race," for the third time. Is it actual mirth? Discomfort? Trained behavioral response? It's certainly not recognition of anything outside his own filmic universe.
 


         






   Allen's view of women has gone from problematic to contemptuous over the years. The young ones, depending on bra size, are either tragic sexpots or bird-brained ingénues. The older ones — well, look at what happened to Judy Davis. Twice. In "Match Point," Scarlett Johansson dodged a big, familiar-looking bullet that has felled more experienced, formidable actresses. A nervier, less earthy performer might have collapsed into a chain-smoking heap of hysteria to play the character of Nola, but Johansson's throaty voice and solid features kept her as grounded as it was possible to be under the circumstances.
 
 This time, she's not so lucky. In "Scoop," she again plays an American abroad who finds herself not just in a different country but in a different world. Sondra Pransky (as unlikely a name for a woman of her generation and background as anyone could ask for) is a gung-ho journalism student visiting her plummy friend Vivian (Romola Garai). As befits Allen's idea of comedy, she's far more resilient and cheerful than she was in the last film, but a lot more clueless too. Desperate for a story with which to wow her friends back in Buffalo or wherever, she tries to land an interview with a famous film director. Instead, she lands in bed with him without knowing quite how it happened. (She feels so stupid!) Back at Vivian's, Sondra agrees to some cheering up, and she and her friend attend a performance by Splendini (Allen), a hack magician performing to packed houses. While waiting in a box to be sawed in half, she is confronted by the ghost of recently departed investigative journalist Joe Strumbel (Ian McShane). Strumbel has just gotten the postmortem scoop of the century: The dead secretary of Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) has accused him of killing her along with a slew of prostitutes. Titled, loaded and sideburned, Peter is dreamboat of the realm and rising political star. Unfortunately, he might also be the Tarot Card Killer.
 
 Why Strumbel shares this information with Sondra is unclear — especially when his old colleagues had such nice things to say about him at the wake. But she runs with it, enlisting the reluctant Splendini, whose real name is Sid Waterman, to help her insinuate herself into Peter's life. Why she thinks this is a good idea, considering her posh setup at Vivian's, is anybody's guess, as the chip on Sid's shoulder keeps threatening to roll off the side of his neck and crush half the English peerage every time she drags him to one of Peter's parties. But it works, and before you know it, Peter has fallen for Sondra like she's Wallis Simpson. Jackson has such a vulpine air about him, it's hard to believe that his character would fall for such a Mindy — unless, of course, he wants to roast and eat her, which at times is what he seems to want. Before she knows it, Sondra is happily ensconced in Peter's world of privilege (it could be a theme park!) and forgetting all about the killer.
 
 There's nothing in "Scoop" that we haven't seen or heard before — in recent Woody Allen, vintage Woody Allen or "A Place in the Sun," but the rapport between Allen and Johansson (pretending to be father and daughter) is lively, and the variations on the same old jokes are plentiful. Overall, though, it feels like an exercise. At this point, giggling at a zinger like "I was born into the Hebrew persuasion, but when I got older I converted to Narcissism" feels indicative of healthy reflexes more than anything else.

The dual elixirs of London and Scarlett Johansson did wonders for Woody Allen last year. On holiday from a hometown that had lost all expression of vitality in his movies, temporarily transplanted to London, and creatively aroused by a strikingly confident young actress not yet 22, Allen responded with Match Point , his best movie in years, and his most psychologically liberated. In Johansson's bold and blunt-talking presence, the septuagenarian director found permission to trade in his worn-out character types for players who were audacious and surprising. And in Allen, the throaty star of Lost in Translation  with the cool, open look of all-American sexual self-possession found an amusing, elderly gentleman champion of delightful and delightfully flattering intellectual cachet.
It's easy to see why the two would want to work together in London again. But it's hard to fathom how, in so short a time, the enduring Svengali of neurotic mannerisms could have gotten one of Hollywood's most individualistic sirens to sound like Julie Kavner and behave like yet another jabbering schlemiel from Mr. Allen's neighborhood, joining the ranks of zombified imitators as diverse as Will Ferrell, Christina Ricci, and Kenneth Branagh. In the labored romantic-comedy whodunit Scoop   a companion piece to Match Point  that suffers all the more in comparison  the fearless Hitchcock blonde plays along with the conceit that she's the infelicitously named Sondra  Pransky, styled with nerd-girl eyeglasses. A Jewish college student who switched from dental studies to journalism, Sondra is visiting posh family friends in London when a chance visit to a borscht-belt-type magic show staged by one Sid Waterman (Allen) changes her fate (a plot device reworked from his own chapter in New York Stories ), putting her on the trail of a serial murderer known as the Tarot Card Killer. Is the fiend in fact the suave aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman)? Intelligence is iffy, since the tip was provided to Sondra during Sid's magic act by the visiting ghost of a recently deceased newspaperman (Ian McShane, reminding us, by his very stare, to watch Deadwood ).
As in Match Point , the class-resistant Yank is attracted to the upper-class Brit, falling into a romance with Lyman that allows plenty of time for Match Point  cinematographer Remi Adefarasin to admire stately homes and gardens. But unlike its predecessor, Scoop  also possessively tethers its bodacious leading lady to the über-shtick of Allen himself. For a fellow so slight of frame, he has become a leaden weight on screen, and his hiccuping delivery of hoary self-referential jokes about Jewish anxiety and ineptitude, along with Woodyish predilections for much younger women, has worn from the dully familiar to the downright irritating. Blessed with an actress who raises his game, Allen has scooped up Johansson  and neutralized her power.

 IN “Scoop,” his not especially funny yet oddly appealing new comedy, Woody Allen manages to  act his age and prove there’s life in those old jokes yet. Like his last outing, the pitch-black drama “Match Point,” the new one revisits a number of Mr. Allen’s favorite themes, including money, conscience and luscious young women ripe for the plucking, this time for laughs. As in the earlier film,  Scarlett Johansson plays the succulent morsel, though with a performance set in the key of screwball rather than noir. Her sweaters are looser,  as is her smile.  The film, in turn,  is positively slack, which turns out to be one of its virtues.  The casting of Ms. Johansson and the announcement that Mr. Allen  would return to the front of the camera were worrisome. He had stayed out of sight for “Match Point,” which was largely sold on its leads and its enthusiastic reviews. The name of its writer and director was conspicuously played down in the advertisements, the consequence of the string of flops he had lately churned out. With its fierce performances and writing, “Match Point” proved very much a return to fine form, if not for the comic Woody Allen, then for the serious Woody Allen, the one who didn’t try to hide his misanthropy, his fear and his loathing behind jokes and shtick. Another plus: he wasn’t in the film groping the starlet.  Relax. Mr. Allen doesn’t manhandle Ms. Johansson, though his camera tends to linger appreciatively over her form. In her role as Sondra Pransky, an American journalism student in London, Ms. Johansson tends to wear roomy, almost dowdy clothes, the exception being a screaming-red maillot that she fills out beautifully, bringing to mind Cathy Moriarty baking under the sun and Robert De Niro’s hotter gaze  in “Raging Bull.” Sondra is more the Nancy Drew type, particularly when dressed and wearing her glasses, though she is also the kind of girl reporter who thinks nothing of sleeping with her interviewees to get the story. Nancy Drew probably didn’t  go past  first base,  but neither did she chase ghosts and aristocrats while running with a magician called Splendini.  The premise of “Scoop” sounds like the windup to a joke: a journalist walks into a magician’s trick closet, where she meets an actual ghost, and — presto, changeo — walks out with a news lead of a lifetime. The ghost, a recently deceased journalist, Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), believing he knows the identity of a serial killer on the hunt, gives Sondra the scoop. This, in turn, leads to an affectionately testy partnership with Splendini,  a k a Sid Waterman (Mr. Allen, of course), and, through some twists and turns, to Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman), an aristocrat who enters the thick of things after making an acquaintance with that screaming-red bathing suit. None of it makes much sense, but, like slackness, nonsense proves a virtue here.  Mr. Allen doesn’t seem to be working terribly hard in “Scoop,” and while that makes for some apparent goofs and lots of ragged edges,  it gives the whole thing a pleasantly carefree vibe. After the first 20 or so clunky minutes, the film settles into a groove and then, ever so slightly, deepens. Mr. Allen’s  invocation of the “Thin Man” films  in an interview makes sense, even if he’s no William Powell and Ms. Johansson is certainly no Myrna Loy. “Scoop” was made by someone who understands that what makes the “Thin Man” series enduring isn’t whodunit and why, but the way Nick and Nora look  at each other as they sip their martinis, Asta nipping at their heels.  Sondra and Sid do all the nipping here, playfully tossing insults  at each other. Mr. Allen’s apparent realization, at long last, that neither his diehard fans nor more agnostic viewers want to watch him paw a much younger woman does wonders. It not only removes the distracting “eew” factor, it also allows him to settle into a more paternal role, which he does with persuasive naturalness.  More important, it also means “Scoop” isn’t just another one of those narcissistic revues in which a Woody Allen-like character, sometimes played by the filmmaker himself, sometimes by an unsettling surrogate (Kenneth Branagh,  Will Ferrell and so on), gobbles up the screen, the woman, our attention and our presumed love. In “Scoop” he has to share, and he does.  That Mr. Allen has opted to share the limelight with an actress he is content to look at but not touch adds an interesting kink to what may be an entire new chapter in his life’s work. Just barely out of her teens, Ms. Johansson has yet to learn how to control either the husk in her voice or that lovely lush  body, which makes for moments both charmingly awkward and just awkward. Mr. Allen is a famously reticent director, at least when it comes to his actors, who often seem to direct themselves. Ms. Johansson’s performance is all over the place in “Scoop,” but finally works for a film that is itself all over the place. Mr. Allen seems happy to just watch her strut her stuff, and after a while so are we.  “Scoop” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There’s a murder subplot, but it’s all very gentle.

After Woody Allen had made one too many "serious" films, his devoted fans longed for him to go back to being funny again. Things now have come full circle, for after "Scoop," they're going to wish the Woodman would stick to serious drama from now on. New pic reps a dismaying comic revisiting of the same themes and dramatic situations he so richly mined in his last film, "Match Point," in his second feature in a row fixated on murder and deception among contempo London's upper crust. Focus Features release fails in inverse ratio to how its predecessor succeeded, and will thus lose Allen much of the critical goodwill and modestly improved B.O. strength he so recently regained.
After the accomplished smoothness of "Match Point," it's back to more ragged form in "Scoop," despite the almost identical posh settings, the return of Scarlett Johansson as leading lady and the continued collaboration of key crew, notably lenser Remi Adefarasin.
The beginning is not unpromising, and one can remain hopeful for the first reel or so. A just-deceased star newspaper reporter, Joe Strombel (Ian McShane), passes the time during a nocturnal crossing of the River Styx talking with a woman who claims she was poisoned because she discovered the identity of a serial killer who's been terrifying London. Excited by the potential scoop, Strombel jumps overboard to pursue the story.
Wide-eyed, eager and slightly geeky Sondra Pransky (Johansson) is a Yank student journalist visiting England whose first attempt to score an interview ends instead with her becoming just another notch in the belt of a macho film director. On a night out, she's selected to participate in a disappearing act conducted by stage magician Sid Waterman (Allen), who places Sondra inside a cabinet while delivering his shtick. Whom should she meet inside the box but Joe Strombel, who tells her the Tarot Card Killer is one Peter Lyman before promptly vanishing.
Revelation sets off a highly unlikely hunt by the very green Yank journo (she's never even heard of Jack the Ripper) with the even more unlikely assistance of Sid, who kvetches and kvails at everything while working Sondra into a state of anxiety that almost matches his own. Peter Lyman, as everyone in elevated Brit circles knows (Sondra is staying, natch, with very rich friends), is the handsome, sophisticated and debonair son of Lord Lyman, and is convincingly played as such by the handsome, sophisticated and debonair Hugh Jackman.
Plotting to worm her way into Peter's life to get the goods on him, Sondra contrives to force him to "save" her from a swimming mishap at his club, and one look at her in a bathing suit guarantees Peter's willing cooperation in her research. This development would seem to render wizened old Brooklyner Sid the odd man out in the narrative but, having written a role for himself, Allen figures out a way to keep himself front and center, however irrelevantly.
Sadly, Allen's patented harangues and complaints have rarely been more irritating, not only because they sound like barely revised versions of those we've heard many times before, but because his broad accent and uncouth manner stand out so conspicuously amid so many well-spoken British thesps. Asked with some bemusement by some stiff old Brits about his background, Sid replies, "I was born into the Hebrew persuasion, but when I got older I converted to narcissism."
Amidst this cast of great-looking younger actors, however, Allen seems an unlikely candidate for high marks in narcissism. Looking significantly older than when he last appeared onscreen (in "Anything Else" three years back), Allen comes off as a disagreeably disgruntled curmudgeon whose wit has curdled and who has been shoehorned into a story about deceit among sexy young people. At least Allen, at long last, has not cast himself as a prospective romantic interest for his early-20s female partner, deigning instead to assign himself the role of a father figure.
So closely does "Scoop" hew to "Match Point" in the playing out of its morality charade that the one scene that would have explicitly acknowledged the latter film's debt to Dreiser's "An American Tragedy" and George Stevens' "A Place in the Sun" -- the famous rowboat drowning -- is actually included here.
To be fair, in tone and in its relative weightlessness, new pic has more in common with some of the filmmaker's goofy little crime comedies like "Manhattan Murder Mystery" -- also about amateur sleuths -- than with "Match Point" or that film's closest cousin, "Crimes and Misdemeanors." But to anyone who hoped his last film promised both a new resurgence of seriousness and artistry, "Scoop" can only be a prime disappointment.
Johansson, made to play down her sexiness at times with big round glasses and some unfashionable clothes, seems to be channeling both Allen and an assortment of semi-daffy female characters from previous Allen pics. Jackman is smoothness personified and McShane, while vigorous as the enterprising journo whom death denies his greatest story, should be cashing in on his "Deadwood" career rebirth with more rewarding roles. Charles Dance is in briefly for an excellent turn as a newspaper editor evaluating Sondra's story.

For 35 years, Woody Allen  was a long shot to stray into the Bronx  or Staten Island much less the alien reaches of London, England. The creator of Manhattan  has always been joined to his chosen borough like pastrami on ryeso when he ventured abroad last year to direct the intriguing morality tale Match Point , moviegoers were taken aback. George Bush  doesn't join the Taliban ; Woody Allen doesn't cross the East River.
Allen should have concluded his expatriate foray with Match Point . The second straight film he's made in Londonan alleged return to comedy called Scoop is so flat, dull, and off form that it seems to have been conceived in a fog. It not only lacks the verve and energy of Allen's best New Yorkbased work, it feels culturally adrift, like some bewildered tourist trying to read a city map held upside down. For years, even some of the staunchest Allen fans have suspected that his best days are behind him. But when his famously neurotic one-liners start to bomb, there's real trouble. At the very least, the filmmaker might have borrowed some of the brilliant mischief of this movie's vastly superior namesake, written by the great British satirist Evelyn Waugh . Alas, he doesn't.
The latest object of Allen's affections at least in the dramatic realmis the nubile Scarlett Johansson , who portrayed a demanding, self-absorbed actress in Match Point  and returns here as Sondra Pransky , a naive American journalism student who's visiting a friend in London when she inadvertently stumbles onto what may turn out to be the murder scandal of the decade. The bespectacled Sondra's reportorial skills are limited, to say the least, but she's not above a bit of feminine wile. Make what you will of Scoop 's first scene: The heroine pursues into a London hotel lobby a horny movie director who's about three times her age and, instead of getting an interview, lands in his bed. If, in Allen's scheme of things, wishful thinking merges with autobiography, so be it. It's a bit tougher to accept the filmmaker's appearance in Scoop  as a professional magician named Splendini, who specializes in "dematerializing" women by means of a double-paneled box. Here is Allen as stammering self-parody; a pent-up bundle of tics and quirks so irritating that, halfway through, you may feel like ending the misery (his and yours) by clamping an ether-soaked rag over that long-beloved old face.
As it is, Splendinia/k/a Sidney Waterman , an old-fashioned vaudevillian to the bonebecomes the unwitting agent of Sondra Pransky's investigative and romantic adventures. Plucked from the audience and secreted away in his magic box, the young woman is unexpectedly accosted there by a renowned (albeit recently deceased) London newspaperman named Joe Strombel  (Deadwood  's foulmouthed Ian McShane ). Frustrated that he can no longer get the story himself, the avuncular Joe puts Sondra on the trail of a suave nobleman named Peter Lyman  (Hugh Jackman ), who the dead reporter insists is London's new version of Jack the Ripper , an elusive monster known to the Fleet Street tabloids as the "Tarot Card Killer." Like Humphrey Bogart  in Play It Again, Sam , canny Joe becomes the protagonist's guide and mentor from beyond the grave.
As if this supernatural turn of plot were not familiar enough, Allen also insists on having Sondraposing now as "Jade Spence "fall in love with the dashing and possibly dangerous Peter even as she snoops into his secrets. In a goofier development, she also recruits the reluctant Sidney to play the part of her father, "Mr. Spence," who's quickly drawn into the chase. The notion of a phobia-rattled Jew from New York dropped into the staid Protestant garden parties of upper-crust London could have provided Allen with one of his richest comic spectacles. But he doesn't make much of it beyond attacking the buffet table and startling the guests with a couple of ancient card tricks. "I was of the Hebrew persuasion," Sidney says of his origins, "but I converted to narcissism." That's about the pinnacle in the wisecrack department, and as far as pursuing the suspected killer goes, the director did that in much funnier fashion back on home turf in Manhattan Murder Mystery .
In the end, the semi-dimwitted Sondra gets her man, and Sidney Waterman winds up, like Joe Strombel, in limbohere portrayed as a tramp steamer adrift on a fog-shrouded seastanding among a group of baffled "passengers" who are wondering where they're headed and why. Given the inertia of Scoop  and the uncertain course of Allen's career as it enters twilight, it's an appropriate final image.
