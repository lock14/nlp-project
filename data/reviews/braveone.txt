The Brave One
 is a confounding movie on many levels. For all its sophistication and sensitivity, it turns out to be little more than an upscale B-movie about getting even. This revenge fantasy is set in motion by a senseless act of horrendous violence: Erica Bain (Foster), the host of a New York City radio program, is brutally beaten along with her fianc� while walking their dog one evening in Central Park. She survives; he doesn�t. In recovering from this horrible experience, Erica falls out of love with her beloved city and hardens into an avenging angel armed with a handgun, stalking the nighttime streets of Manhattan like some stealth superhero dispensing her own brand of justice. She goes Bernie Goetz on the subway, dispatches a pimp like Travis Bickle, and finishes off a sleazy bad guy like Dirty Harry reincarnated. Each time Erica exacts her vengeance on the criminal element, you�re not sure whether to cheer or recoil. The Brave One
 seems to want it both ways: It stirs up emotions that justify Erica�s lawless actions but doesn�t flinch in depicting the terrible psychological price she pays with each killing. Foster is very good as the conflicted Erica, subtly detailing her character�s transformative journey into the heart of darkness without losing the humanity of this lost individual. When Foster looks in the mirror during the course of the film, you can see Erica realizing, with a mixture of fear and fascination, that she is becoming a person she no longer recognizes. Unfortunately, the plotting in The Brave One
 is rather pedestrian and often flawed, undermining this film�s potential for greatness. The absence of eyewitnesses to most of Erica�s killings is too convenient, and the platonic relationship that develops between Erica and the police detective investigating the vigilante murders (an empathetic Howard) is contrived. By the time the big moment arrives when Erica faces the three hoodlums who murdered her great love and irreversibly changed her life, it�s clear what kind of movie The Brave One
 ultimately wants to be. Without giving anything away, let�s just say that the film�s title is completely drained of any remaining irony at this point, abandoning intellectual honesty in favor of giving the people what they want.


"The Brave One" serves us Jodie Foster as we've rarely seen her: blissfully well adjusted and in a skirt. She practically skips through the film's Manhattan locations in sneakers like the girl she never got to play when she was an actual girl. Her character, Erica Bain, hosts a radio talk show and is crazy in love with a handsome doctor (Naveen Andrews). When they head out to walk the dog in Central Park one evening, they look like they're bouncing to the end of some romantic comedy. In a sense they are, since all this happiness lasts about 15 minutes.
No breezy, beskirted Jodie Foster movie can stay that way for long. Thugs beat the boyfriend to death, take the dog, and leave Erica in a three-week coma. That woman of such exhilarating, if uncharacteristic, lightness emerges from that chrysalis as the iron butterfly we've seen so many times before. Yet once Erica starts conquering her post-traumatic stress by buying a gun and ridding New York of its creeps and crooks, "The Brave One" is no longer just another Jodie Foster picture. It is the ultimate Jodie Foster picture, an entertaining if absurd walking tour of a movie star's psyche and persona.
As a performer, Foster has always been drawn to trauma, to characters whose guard is so irreversibly up that the down setting seems to have malfunctioned. Here she appears to be wrestling with the screen image she's cultivated. Erica's descent into vigilantism, her ambivalence about the thrill of shooting punks on the subway and saving hookers from pimps is fascinating. Not only has the 12-year-old prostitute from "Taxi Driver" become her psychopathic protector, the young star who never wanted to discuss the unwanted attention she garnered from a would-be presidential assassin now seems OK playing a killer.
The movie itself isn't nearly as interesting as whatever it is Foster is trying to work out for its two hours. "The Brave One" is credited to three writers, Roderick Taylor, Bruce A. Taylor, and Cynthia Mort; and Neil Jordan directed. They've made "Taxi Driver Lite," as it will probably be called in Martin Scorsese's house. Jordan's movie explains its heroine's violent bender as a matter of personal justice - not as the murderously allergic reaction to the inhumanity of life in a concrete jungle.
Where "Taxi Driver" was driven by atmosphere and character, "The Brave One" is oppressively plot-driven. All the mood is snuffed out. The filmmakers so want Erica's actions to make sense to us that the movie usually seems illogical despite itself. It's not alarming when Erica plugs those two lewd dudes on the subway ("So you gonna give me some Radiohead, too?"). What is alarming is that there's no one else in the station when she gets off. It's that kind of movie.
It's also the kind of movie that shows you how far off the deep end Erica has gone by decorating her very nice apartment with half-empty cartons of Chinese food (yes, the chopsticks poke out of the side). Instead of cruising the city's underbelly in a cab, Erica struts around with a microphone, recording urban sounds and her own musings. At some point, she convinces her boss (Mary Steenburgen) to put her back on the air, and her show, "Street Walk," becomes the public vehicle for her inner thoughts. Her first post-coma broadcast is an awkward tribute to her city. "New York," she says several times before settling on a monologue about her brush with fear. Listening to the words, you might think about Travis Bickle's disgusted "great rain" speech or Woody Allen's stammering visual love letter to New York at the beginning of "Manhattan." Rather than use the opportunity to wed Erica's confessional to images of the city, Jordan keeps the camera on Foster, denying the words their social resonance yet allowing the character to blame the city for giving her a dark side. It's only personal for Erica. She's half Bickle, half Batman.
A lot of "The Brave One," though, is a police procedural, with Terrence Howard playing the lead detective trying to solve Erica's murders. She pretends to want an interview for her show. And I'd like to think he pretends not to know she's killing all these people long enough for the movie to arrive at its stupid, gruesome finale, which is like some Rockstar Games version of the climax from "The Silence of the Lambs." Howard and Foster do have a couple of good, flirtatious scenes together that harmonize their unique approaches to sexiness (he's satin, she's steel).
But those are nothing compared to a scene Erica has in the back of a Town Car with a strung-out hooker. All she does is talk to the girl, who's played by Zoe Kravitz (Lenny and Lisa Bonet's kid), but Foster's husky voice seems meant for this sort of seduction, even though there's not much of a reason for Erica to be this sexual (the movie is so overwritten that you second-guess just about every plot point and behavioral tic). But Jordan goes with it, allowing this short, already suspenseful scene the bonus of containing more true eroticism than all of "Somersby." If the "Taxi Driver" model holds, there's also the added intrigue of Foster communing with herself.
Still, as cracked as Erica becomes, the movie is too meek and Foster too intensely coiled to let the character lose complete control. This is a moral universe over from the one in "Taxi Driver." Erica is a middle-class woman striking out vengefully against New York's lowlifes. That means something completely different from an alienated cabbie doing the same thing. When she's done, you don't expect to see her go to therapy or jail. You expect to see her congratulated on "Oprah."


         "THE BRAVE ONE" is less a brave movie than a foolhardy one. Trapped in a no man's land between seriousness and pulp trash, it plays like a combination of "Death Wish" and "The Hours." If that sounds like an awkward fit, it is.
 
 The first collaboration between upmarket Hollywood star Jodie Foster and mass-market producer Joel Silver, "The Brave One" is an unwise attempt to have it all, to attract the sensitive audience that swoons at Ms. Foster's nuanced performances as well as the yahoos who scream when evil blood is spilt. Would that it were that simple.
 


         






   Though a lot of prerelease talk about Foster's role as a woman who kills those who deserve to die on the forever-mean streets of New York has referenced the celebrated 1974 vigilante movie "Death Wish" (which had four sequels), a more apt comparison is "Ms. 45," an unapologetically violent potboiler directed by the unrepentant Abel Ferrara in 1981 about, yes, a woman who murderously takes the law into her own hands.
 
 Because neither Foster nor director Neil Jordan wants anyone to think they've made anything as lurid and disreputable as "Ms. 45: The Sequel," great pains have been taken to dress up "The Brave One's" similar material in socially acceptable clothing.
 
 Once Foster committed to the project, screenwriter Cynthia Mort (HBO's "Tell Me You Love Me") was brought on to "add a female voice" (says producer Susan Downey) to the writing team of Roderick Taylor and Bruce A. Taylor, and the star herself has been insistent in a slew of interviews that "The Brave One" is "a much deeper, monstrously existential journey" than it is a mere revenge story.
 
 Unfortunately, the film Foster thinks she has made is not the one on the screen. Both director Jordan and producer Silver, who insisted on retaining the project's gung-ho title despite objections from the star, have ensured that "The Brave One's" numerous violent moments are made with enough bloodthirsty enthusiasm to appeal to the audience that dotes on savage retribution.
 
 If the level of violence makes "The Brave One's" soul-in-torment stuff seem more like window dressing than it should, what legitimately tormented moments the film does have make the violence sequences feel tacked on and out of place. Instead of the best of both worlds, the filmmakers have managed to deliver the worst.
 
 "The Brave One" does not start particularly well either, as it introduces Foster as Erica Bain, an NPR-type voice who delivers radio essays of such crescendoing banality it's hard to believe that she is a successful on-air personality in the great city of New York. Erica is also part of a fun, kicky Manhattan relationship with handsome young doctor David Kirmani (Naveen Andrews), a love duet of such supreme happiness that it's only a matter of time until something very bad happens to the couple.
 
 On a dark night in Central Park, that evil comes to pass: The young lovers are given beatings of such ferocity that potential viewers of "The Brave One" would be well advised to come to the theater 10 minutes late and miss that particular bit of carnage entirely.
 
 A physical and mental wreck, Erica must figure out a reason to keep living, and it is in these moments, brief though they are, that Foster is at her most convincing and psychologically effective.
 
 But "The Brave One" does not want to linger on this kind of pain: After all, Erica has places to go and people to kill. Soon enough she purchases a 9-millimeter handgun to ease her troubled mind, and before you can say "Charles Bronson," a series of wicked coincidences put her in contact with charter members of the Deserve to Die club. The rest, as they say, is history.
 
 The film's violence also connects Erica with another big-city loner, New York police Det. Sean Mercer. As played by Terrence Howard, one of those actors who never puts a wrong foot forward, Det. Mercer is a more involving character than he would otherwise be. But the scenes Howard and Foster share can't redeem "The Brave One." Even if it's true that "anyone can cross that line, anyone can be a killer," not just anyone can make that premise into a convincing film.
 
 "The Brave One." MPAA rating: R, for strong violence, language and some sexuality. Running time: 1 hour, 59 minutes. In general release.   

Jodie Foster has perfected a gesture over the years that's as identifiably her own as the caressing, melancholy precision of her alto voice: She cocks her head slightly downward and sideways while she fixes her steel-blue gaze on the object of her study. Her eyebrows knit slightly. Often, the camera pushes in close, drawn to her intelligent face, which is becoming even lovelier and more at peace with each accumulating decade. Hers is a look that, depending on the script, conveys ''You're hurting me,'' ''You're about to make me do something I didn't think I had in me,'' or ''There's no turning back now, so I'm going to defend myself by any means possible.'' As The Brave One 's Erica Bain, a New York City talk-radio essayist whose sense of home, safety, and self are undone after a violent mugging in which she's attacked and her fiancé is beaten to death, Foster adds another layer of meaning to that tilt of chin: ''I'm pushing beyond fear  and I'm going to shoot you.''
Everything about Foster's ocular intensity is riveting, but little in this hushed vigilante drama makes sense. Instead, there's a progressively alienating deficiency of logic in the provocative enterprise, a diminishing return as the subsequent kills pile up. The crazy-making quotient begins with the rosy depiction of the city Erica starts out loving so much, and ends with a climax of ludicrous happenstance involving the avenging woman and Terrence Howard as a mournfully divorced NYPD detective who becomes involved in the case  and bewitched by Erica's gaze. The movie is a maddening mumble of a tale akin to a garbled NYC subway loudspeaker announcement that seems to be advising citizens to rub each other out rather than report suspicious activity.
In the beginning, see, Erica is a lucky public-radio employee very much in love with her doctor fiancé, David (Naveen Andrews). To create her poetic pieces about New York  the essays are a cross between Garrison Keillor monologues and Ben Katchor's graphic novels about the pleasures of urban decay  she strolls around dangling a microphone to collect ambient sound. And to unwind with David after work, the two walk their dog in one of New York's great parks. Thousands of other dog walkers do the same. Only not in Erica's world, apparently. What New York is this, and in what decade, where a man and a woman can find a park devoid of all other New Yorkers except crazed evildoers in the kind of scary-looking underpass that occupies a timid tourist's nightmares? Besides, what kind of New Yorker walks into park tunnels at night?
When the couple is ambushed, we seem to be inhabiting the 1970s of Dirty Harry , Death Wish , and Taxi Driver . But if so, why do the perps document their sick acts with digital technology suitable for Internet broadcast? Later, Erica will buy an illegal handgun, ride a subway occupied by a new set of menacing creeps, whip out her weapon, blow them away, and exit unseen. What manner of unrecognizable woman is this? I was born and live in Erica's city, and have walked her streets since the Son of Sam was on the loose. Yet I can't feel her fear, not really, either as cinematically heightened reality or as feminine state of psychological siege. (Aside from her fiancé, the only soul this loner knows would appear to be an African neighbor who murmurs sisterly wisdom.)
Confounded, I can only gaze back at Foster's clear eyes, interested but unconvinced  and turn for comic relief to Nicky Katt's invigorating supporting bit as the city's only reliably contemporary, unanguished cop. The Brave One  is directed with an Irish fondness for gloom by Neil Jordan, whose feel for alienated outsiders glints through every one of his films, from The Crying Game  to Breakfast on Pluto , but whose nonresident sense of Big Apple energy can't be trusted. It's produced by Joel Silver, whose love of mow-the-bad-guys-down combustion built an action empire, but whose interest in verisimilitude is, let's say, limited. (The screenplay is by father and son Roderick and Bruce A. Taylor, and Cynthia Mort. Surely it didn't take a team to come up with a fortune-cookie pronouncement like ''Anyone can cross the line  anyone can be a killer.'')
As a public-radio liberal mugged by reality, Erica Bain may be meant to embody the new conservatism. As a woman with a gun who trades her humanity for the cold, heartless anesthetic of revenge, she may be meant to be a warning against feminism. Just because I don't buy either line doesn't mean I don't appreciate the appeal of that compelling Foster head swivel. Not that I'd defend it to the death.

 Erica Bain, the gunslinging heroine of “The Brave One,” is the host of a public radio talk show called “Street Walk” that takes a sentimental, nostalgic view of New York City. Also a rather purple one, since Erica is prone to come up with poeticisms on the order of “New buildings sprout like chromosomes from the city’s DNA,” a sentence that  someone evidently thought so highly of that we get to hear it twice.  Until a senseless act of violence wrecks her affection, Erica looks back longingly at a vanished metropolis whose touchstones include Eloise at the Plaza and Sid Vicious at the Hotel Chelsea. She sighs about how that old Manhattan — Edgar Allan Poe and Andy Warhol are other names in her necrology — is “dying.”  For its part, “The Brave One,” though set in the present, tries to conjure a more specific moment in the history of New York, a time when its citizens, on screen and off, seemed to be in far greater danger of actually dying at one another’s hands. Around 30 years ago, in the depths of its civic and fiscal crises, the city served as a perfect setting for nasty, dark-hearted crime dramas — tales of vengeance that ranged from “Death Wish,” on the brutal, populist end of the spectrum, to the more self-aware and nuanced “Taxi Driver.”  In that movie Jodie Foster played Iris, the young prostitute who was the object of Travis Bickle’s white-knight fantasies. In this one Ms. Foster’s character, Erica, is, like Travis, a haunted survivor who supplies rueful voice-over narration.  But her spirit is in many ways closer to that of Charles Bronson’s workaday vigilante in the “Death Wish” movies. The public radio gig, the references to Emily Dickinson and D. H. Lawrence, the directing credit for Neil Jordan (of “Crying Game” fame) — all of this produces a patina of refinement and seriousness.  But don’t be fooled. “The Brave One,” though well cast and smoothly directed, is just as crude and ugly as you want it to be.  And that, the movie insists, is how, in your heart of hearts, you really do want it to be. Its none-too-subtle governing idea is that even the most effete, brownstone-dwelling public radio listener (or New York Times reader) might feel the occasional urge to blow someone’s head off.  Mr. Jordan and the screenwriters,  the father-and-son team Roderick  Taylor and  Bruce A. Taylor,  and Cynthia Mort, clearly relish the conceit of transforming a slightly built, overcivilized blonde  into a killing machine. After allowing us a glimpse of the carefree life Erica shares with her fiancé, David (Naveen Andrews) — scenes that remind you just how little the portrayal of happiness has figured in Ms. Foster’s recent performances — they plunge her into a modern urban horror story.  While walking their dog at dusk in Central Park, with joggers and park-bench sitters in sight, Erica and David are viciously beaten and robbed by three thugs, who also steal the dog. As if to emphasize the swift, brutal transition from before to after, Mr. Jordan tastelessly juxtaposes images of Erica’s bloody clothes being stripped off in the emergency room with flashbacks of David slowly undressing her for lovemaking. After three weeks in a coma, Erica awakens to find that David has died and that she is paralyzed by fear and grief.  The cure is an illegally purchased 9-millimeter  pistol and a box of bullets (when told of the mandatory 30-day waiting period for a legal purchase at a downtown gun store, she replies, “I need something now,” perhaps unwittingly echoing one of Homer Simpson’s greatest lines.) At first accidentally and then deliberately, Erica becomes a vigilante, shooting down a murderous husband who is also a convenience-store robber, a pair of iPod thieves who are also potential rapists and a few other bad guys whose badness is similarly overdetermined.  Erica clearly feels some anguish, but little in the way of remorse. Ms. Foster handles her emotions efficiently, having made pain offset by steeliness something of a specialty of late. In “Panic Room” and “Flight Plan” her mix of desperation and ferocity was that of a mother in extremis. Here, looking smaller and more vulnerable but at the same time more ruthless, she is driven by grief, perhaps a less rational and more dangerous motivation.  Not that “The Brave One” is overly concerned with the finer points of her psychological state. Nor does it have much new or interesting to say about the morality of her actions or the urban context she inhabits. Erica’s foil and confidant is a homicide detective named  Sean Mercer (Terrence Howard), who seems to be the only member of the New York Police Department  actually interested in doing his job. (His partner, played by Nick Katt, is the only person in the movie with a sense of humor).  Mercer befriends Erica and agrees to be interviewed for her radio show, even as he is investigating the shootings carried out by the mysterious, presumably male, vigilante.  They have a few desultory discussions about the rule of law and the ethics of extrajudicial killing, arguments that are resolved in a climax that manages to be at once preposterous, sentimental and appalling. That it may also be viscerally satisfying is a sign of just how cowardly “The Brave One” really is. It’s a pro-lynching movie that even liberals can love.  “The Brave One” is rated R  (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has intense violence, profanity and some nudity.

Hell hath no fury like a woman with a grudge, and in �The Brave One,� Jodie Foster unleashes her rage on the mean streets of New York with the same mesmeric intensity and steely resolve that have characterized her very best performances. Foster�s pistol-packing turn as an avenging dark angel nearly sustains director Neil Jordan�s grim vigilante drama through a string of implausibilities and occasionally trite psychological framing devices, with deft support from Terrence Howard as a sympathetic cop. Top talent involved should draw decent midrange B.O. for the Warner Bros. release, despite its tough subject matter.
While Jordan typically works from his own scripts, �The Brave One� (written by Roderick Taylor, Bruce A. Taylor and Cynthia Mort), with its distaff twist on the vigilante picture, feels appropriate coming from a helmer who, in films like �The Crying Game� and �Breakfast on Pluto,� has handled issues of gender subversion with subtlety and dramatic flair. 
Here, he gets a performance out of his lead actress that takes on extra-textual dimensions thanks to Foster�s previous performances as a woman in trouble, whether as a battered prostitute in �Taxi Driver,� a rape victim in �The Accused� or a green FBI agent in �The Silence of the Lambs.�
A radio host who tells stories about life in �the safest big city in the world,� Erica Bain (Foster) finds her world irretrievably altered one night when she and her fiance, David (�Lost�s� Naveen Andrews), are attacked and savagely beaten by a trio of thugs during a stroll through Central Park. The assault leaves David dead and Erica with more lasting psychological than physical scars, and it�s not long afterward that she impulsively buys a gun.
Erica no longer feels safe -- a fact made clear enough by Foster�s clenched, tight-set features, yet also excessively underlined by a nervously swerving camera and ominously subjective tracking shots through a dark corridor. But Erica�s fear and grief are ultimately subsumed by her anger, and when she kills for the first time -- in self-defense -- it leaves her with a vague appetite for more.
Justice or revenge? Hero or villain? All the usual questions arise, some of them pondered by callers-in to Erica�s show, who are alarmed by the vigilante in their midst. They�re pondered, too, by Sean Mercer (a superbly world-weary Howard), a cynical detective whom Erica interviews for a segment, and who also happens to be investigating Erica�s handiwork.
While the relationship between these two unexpectedly kindred spirits takes on a queasy intimacy that results in some of the film�s strongest scenes, it also points up the script�s reliance on tidy coincidences: Even viewers who buy Erica as both cold-blooded murderess and respected media personality may raise an eyebrow at the fact that Mercer and his partner (Nicky Katt) appear to be the only homicide detectives in the entire city. Similarly, that Erica finds herself readily imperiled almost every time she goes out at night -- even when she starts looking for trouble -- seems awfully convenient, even as it promises to feed audiences� worst stereotypes about Gotham crime rates.
But �The Brave One� convinces where it most counts, as Foster delivers a performance of astonishing physical and psychological credibility. Lowering her already deep voice to a husky rasp (speaking mainly in a disturbingly cool voiceover that bleeds into her sessions on the air), her eyes glazed over one moment but flickering with murderous excitement the next, the actress all but physicalizes the idea of a woman boldly inhabiting a man�s skin -- an inner transformation that Erica seems to observe from the outside.
At the same time, Jordan films the actress to accentuate her petite stature, her lithe frame, her thin arms constantly bared from the shoulders. When Erica walks the streets at night or strides purposefully onto a subway platform, she seems to be descending, wraith-like, into the abyss; yet her ferocity can also give way, without warning, to vulnerability and panic, especially when events begin to spiral out of her control.
Even at her most ruthless, Foster never cedes her grip on the viewer�s concern -- but then, neither did Charles Bronson in �Death Wish.� Jordan neither subverts the pleasures of seeing lone-ranger justice onscreen, as David Cronenberg did in �A History of Violence,� nor panders overtly to the audience�s baser instincts; instead, �The Brave One� attempts to tap into post-9/11 anxieties and comment on the very American idea of righteous payback. 
But it�s hard not to feel that this moribund genre has simply exhausted its ability to say anything new, and even the film�s too-twisty denouement -- which brings new meaning to the term �cop-out� -- feels softer than the provocation it�s meant to be.
Pic has its grungy, dark-night-of-the-soul ambience down cold, thanks to expert New York location shooting and Philippe Rousselot�s moody, desaturated lensing. All other tech contributions are pro. 


In the new Neil Jordan  movie, Jodie Foster  plays New York talk radio DJ Erica Bain, who survives a vicious Central Park  mugging and becomes an urban crusader devoted to cleaning up the citywith a Glock  instead of a broom. Yes,The Brave One  is that  movie: the one with the posters of once-upon-a-time sweetheart Foster posed artistically against a yellow background, her hand pressed contemplatively against her salon-styled hair, and the tagline "How Many Wrongs to Make It Right?"
Is The Brave One  any good? Certainly it's one of those movies that exposes how arbitrary such designations as "good" and "bad" can be, whether in regard to the movie itself or the behavior of its characters. As heads roll and Foster's pretty blonde face becomes splattered by increasing amounts of blood, are we really witnessing something courageous (as the title suggests), or merely an unusually literate exploitation flickDeath Wish  with allusions to Lawrence and Dickinsonmeant to cash in on audience feelings of fear and impotence in a violent society?
The premise smacks of high-concept contrivance: For starters, Erica Bain  isn't any run-of-the-mill DJ, but rather the host of a show called Street Walk , for which she prowls the Big Apple, recording the sounds of everyday life and then commenting, in her low, dulcet tones, on the changing, gentrifying face of New York"a city that is disappearing before our eyes." Nor isThe Brave One  content to have Erica be just another victim of random violence. She must first be the fiancée of a sensitive, guitar-strumming male nurse named David (Naveen Andrews ), whose all-around too-good-to- be-trueness is the subject of much envy by Erica's loveless girlfriends. In short, when The Brave One  begins, Erica is living one of those impossibly picture- perfect movie-character lives that seem to cry out for rupture.
But by the time said rupture occurs, there are already strong indications that we're not in Kansasor any recognizable version of the island of Manhattan anymore. Erica and David enter Central Park on 106th Street via the portentously named Stranger's Gate, and by the time they come face-to-face with the pack of tattooed and bandanna'd thugs who beat David to death and leave Erica in a coma, it's as if we've traveled through a space-time wormhole back to the pre-Giuliani city of Erica's nostalgic fantasies. That feeling only grows more intense as Erica, upon her recovery, returns to the streetsand eventually the airwaveswith a firearm in her microphone bag.
Taken literally, almost everything that follows in The Brave One  so seriously strains credibility (even by the standards of the genre) as to enter the realm of the absurd. Taken on the level of a menacing urban fairy tale, howeversomething akin to what Jane Campion  was aiming for with In the Cut it's strangely fascinating. The vigilante movie, after all, has always seemed a plainclothes variation on the superhero movie, with pimps, druggies, and petty crooks subbed for more exotic, power-mad supervillains. Here, Jordan plays up those connections, giving us a New Yorkor a Gotham City, if you willin which Erica Bain can scarcely set foot out of doors without stumbling upon some violation of an innocent. And when she does, the swiftness of her vengeance is quietly startling.
The Brave One  isn't the first femme-centric revenge tale, but unlike the mute protagonist of Abel Ferrara 's immortal Ms .45 , Erica Bain talks about her kills on the radio (in the third person, of course), while callers liken the vigilante, who everyone assumes is a man, to everything from a folk hero"At least we're getting our street cred back!"to an exponent of the war in Iraq . But the script, credited to the father-and-son team of Roderick and Bruce A. Taylor  (vigilante vets with 1983's Michael Douglas  vehicle The Star Chamber  and episodes of The Equalizer  on their shared résumé) and sitcom writer Cynthia Mort , doesn't fully develop any of those ideas, resulting in a movie that hangs in suspended animation between the grindhouse and the art house, as Erica's brutally efficient assassinations and Dirty Harry style one-liners trade off with ruminations on the nature of cities, violent tendencies inherent in the American character, and received notions of morality.
Still, Jordan's ballsy and sometimes bonkers movie is more worth writing, talking, and thinking about than anything that has tumbled off the Hollywood  assembly line in a good long while. It dares to tell a story in which the audience rarely knows where (or if) their sympathies should lie, and which builds toward one of the unhappiest "happy" endings in recent memory. It gives Foster and her granite cheekbones one of their best roles and a few scenes together with Terrence Howard  (as the detective investigating the vigilante case) that burn with the romantic fatalism of a 1940s noir. What does it all amount to? The apparent moral of this bloody fable, as announced to Erica by a kindly neighbor woman, is that "There are plenty of ways to die. You have to figure out a way to live." Which, in the world of The Brave One , is something easier said than done, unless you happen to have a few ounces of lead in your hip pocket.
