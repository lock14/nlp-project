If ever there were a happy summer movie, it�s Hairspray
. But for all its bubbly musical numbers and effervescent good humor, this film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical feels oddly lacquered � it�s John Waters by way of Disney. Hairspray
  adheres closely to the storyline in Waters� 1988 cult film: A pleasantly plump teenager, Tracy Turnblad, becomes the unexpected star on a segregated Baltimore dance show circa 1962 � but its gee-whiz homogenization of adolescent sexual desire and racial politics is from another movie. Decidedly tame by Waters� usual standards, the original Hairspray
 was nostalgic without being saccharine. While there�s nothing offensive about the wholesomeness of this new Hairspray
, you wish that it didn�t feel as if every hair were in place. Even the very white villains in the piece, ice queen Velma Von Tussel and her bratty daughter, Amber, are more annoying than deliciously nasty in their hatred of overweight and black people. Marc Shaiman�s infectious (albeit  repetitive) Tony-winning score keeps things moving at a lively pace, but many of the plot points get glossed over in the process. For example, Tracy�s rise to stardom on the Corny Collins Show
 literally happens overnight, and her budding romance with heartthrob Link (Efron) never jells as believable. Of course, comparisons between the female leads in Waters� original film and this version are inevitable. As Tracy, Blonsky looks the part and can sing up a storm, but she lacks the spunk of perky Ricki Lake, who really made you believe that big was beautiful. Travolta has some pretty large shoes to fill in the role of Tracy�s hefty mother, Edna, given that the late and great Divine made the part her own as only she could. A frazzled hausfrau with a hint of drag queen, Divine didn�t so much act the part as she did posture in it, but that approach to the role seemed fitting in Waters� vision of Sixties angst. A heavily made-up Travolta aims for a more realistic portrayal, and it works for the most part. There�s sadness in this insecure woman, who�s so ashamed of her plus-size appearance that she won�t leave the house. And when Edna finally lets loose in the film�s finale, there�s a joy onscreen that rocks the house. Who ever thought someone in a fat suit could be so nimble and full of life?

To answer your first question: He looks like Barney. A huge, flesh-colored Barney. Or maybe like Barbra Streisand after a Botox overdose. Actually, there are times in "Hairspray " when John Travolta seems on the verge of being eaten by his fat suit, so swaddled is the actor in padding, hair, make up, and structural engineering. I haven't even mentioned the exceedingly strange accent in which he delivers his lines: Carol Channing by way of the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel.

And yet -- Edna Turnblad lives. The dumpy shut-in, laundress, and mother to irrepressible teen dynamo Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky ) becomes as much a full-figured character as a full-figured gal in this supremely energetic Broadway transplant. Against all expectations, "Hairspray" turns out to be an explosion of industrial-strength good cheer, delivered by very smart show-biz pros with wit, passion, and a soup�on of dementia. Resistance is futile.

Let's backtrack. In 1988, cult-movie director John Waters directed the original "Hairspray," a sneakily subversive blast of early- ' 60's nostalgia about TV dance shows and rock 'n' roll integration. It starred the filmmaker's 300-lb . drag muse Divine as Edna, a newcomer named Ricki Lake as Tracy, and if you've never seen it, get it on your Netflix queue immediately. The "Madison Time " scene alone can change your life.

In 2002, "Hairspray" landed on Broadway, transformed into a big but still reasonably perverse musical. It won eight Tonys , assuring a trip back to celluloid. Correct me if I'm wrong, but only "The Producers " has followed the same movie-to-musical-to-movie path, and that one was a high-spirited embalming.

Not this time. From the very first number, in which Blonsky belts out "Good Morning Baltimore " over the sleazy sights, sounds, and smells of her city, the film clears the launch pad and soars into orbit. Adapted by the reliable screenwriter Leslie Dixon and directed by former choreographer Adam Shankman (he made alleged comedies like "The Pacifier " and "Bringing Down the House, " but we'll overlook that for now), "Hairspray" is once again a movie.

If you look fast, you'll see Waters himself in a cameo (as a flasher; what else?), proof the new film is in touch with its dyed roots. Further evidence is in the casting, which includes Christopher Walken as father Wilbur Turnblad , proprietor of the Hardy-Har Hut joke shop above which his family lives; Michelle Pfeiffer as Velma Von Tussle , evil TV station manager and mother of Tracy's teen rival, Amber (Brittany Snow ); Queen Latifah as record-store owner Motormouth Maybelle , almost emerging from the shadow of the late Ruth Brown in the original film.

Even the younger roles have been cast with an acerbic grin, from Amanda Bynes as Tracy's BFF, Penny Pingleton (what she does to a lollipop could violate the Mann Act ), to "High School Musical " dreamboat Zac Efron as Link Larkin , teen idol of "The Corny Collins Show ." Whether he's acting or not, Efron's as adorably dull as Michael St. Gerard was in 1988. They're both baby Elvii and the hottest things in 1962 Baltimore.

"Hairspray" remains a story of social outsiders cheerfully bashing their way into the spotlight. If Blonsky's Tracy demands to know why a "pleasingly plump" teenage girl with ultra-high hair can't do the Monkey on local afternoon TV -- and get the guy in the bargain -- her war is waged with swing and a smile. (Until that unfortunate assault charge, at least.)

Singing "Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now," Tracy scales the battlements of uptight Baltimore and drags black kids like Seaweed Stubbs (a terrifically limber and engaging Elijah Kelley ) and his sister Little Inez (Taylor Parks ) in her wake, trying to finish what Elvis started by getting them on TV to dance to their own music. Unlike the Waters movie, she steps aside at a crucial point and lets them lead the charge on their own. In general, this "Hairspray" has a winking awareness of the way the white mainstream strip-mines African-American culture that just barely saves the movie from smugness. (Or as Tracy says, "Being invited places by black people -- it's so hip!")

I do miss the R&B chestnuts of the first "Hairspray," but the Broadway songs are tremendous, cross-pollinating doo-wop, soul music, and Lesley Gore with arch comic irony. When Corny Collins (James Marsden of the "X-Men " movies, all Brylcreem and teeth) introduces his show with the energetic dance number "The Nicest Kids in Town ," the compliment carries a social and racial sting. But it's got a good beat and you can dance to it.

The real secret weapon here may be composer Marc Shaiman , who wrote the tunes and, with Scott Wittman , the lyrics for the Broadway show. Shaiman's the mad doctor who gave us the musical numbers in "South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut " and he's a master of slick, propulsively funny pastiche.

Still, Broadway addicts will mourn the disappearance of a handful of songs as "Hairspray" expands to fill the dimensions of a movie screen. The energy comes more from the performances and score than the filmmaking, but Shankman directs ably, and he even pulls the camera back to take in large-scale dance numbers instead of cutting feverishly among the body parts as "Chicago " and other modern screen musicals do. Of the new breed of Tony-winning transfers, "Hairspray" makes the leap most confidently. (But what's the competition? "Rent "? "Phantom "??)

Blonsky even outshines Lake (who turns up here in a cameo), partially because Tracy's confidence can now take flight in song as well as dance. Pfeiffer restarts her career with a bang after five years offscreen, turning Velma into a tight-lipped vamp quivering with racist politesse. That said, the scene I'll pack away in my movie-memento scrapbook doesn't involve either actress. It's the backyard " (You're) Timeless to Me " number, in which Travolta's Edna, as balletic as the hippo in "Fantasia ," trips the light fantastic with her husband.

If you haven't seen 1981's "Pennies From Heaven " lately, maybe you've forgotten that Walken's a song-and-dance man. Here he and his cross-dressing co-star pirouette up and down the fire escape and around the clothesline, segueing into a Latin dance number that briefly raises the specter of "Saturday Night Fever ." It's a lovely scene, suffused with a grace that comes from our longstanding affection for both actors. It also marks the line where "Hairspray" stops short, because the sequence builds to a kiss that just isn't allowed to happen.

A minor hiccup, maybe, but it makes you realize how much transgressiveness has been purged from this project. Divine was patently a gay man in a cheap housedress (so was Harvey Fierstein onstage); by contrast, Travolta plays Edna blissfully straight. A kiss would break that illusion and take the character out of the closet, and this movie's not going to risk that.

Seaweed and Penny Pingleton do share a juicy interracial smooch -- hot enough to discomfit all the right people -- but "Hairspray" is still overly nervous about the love between a man and his wife who's actually another man in 75 pounds of foam and enough foundation to spackle the USS Constitution . Maybe I'm carping: The movie's tremendous fun. And maybe we're not as far from 1962 as we think.



         At first blush, the idea of a movie musical based on the Broadway musical based on "Hairspray," the film by John Waters, seems beyond derivative — it's practically inbred. So it comes as a surprise when the movie turns out to be as happy, healthy and attractive as it does. How the new film directed by Adam Shankman, written by Leslie Dixon and produced by Craig Zadan and Neil Meron ("Chicago") compares to the staged production I can't say, not having seen the show, but the movie's style and exuberance torpedoed my initial misgivings within seconds.
 
 It's the strangest thing, but the huge budget seems to have given what began as a humble crackpot satire the scope and grandiosity it needed to really go over the top. The opening crane shot alone, which soars over the city's humble brick row-houses to the strains of a civic love ballad, is hilariously over the top. Finally, you think, here is Baltimore as it was always meant to be oversold.
 


         






   A buoyant fantasy of once-upon-a-time innocence, "Hairspray" is so upbeat, so exuberantly cheerful, that it could have easily turned into something quite embarrassing to behold. But for all its sweetness and genuine tenderness (who could have guessed that an intimate musical number featuring Christopher Walken and John Travolta would turn out to be the most romantic love scene of the year so far?), it's also pretty well barbed. What it offers isn't really a nostalgic look at a "more innocent time" so much as a saucy wink at a casually vicious time that is constantly being sold to us as innocent.
 
 From the moment Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) jumps out of bed and walks out her front door, every hair sprayed stiffly in place, her implacable enthusiasm is met with friendly reminders that the world is not quite the sunny place she believes it to be. In fact, she hasn't even made it through the first musical number — an ebullient love song to her beloved Baltimore — when she's already encountered rats on the street, drunks at a bar and a friendly neighborhood flasher, played by the multitalented Mr. Waters himself. School is boring, pregnant ladies celebrate their miracles with cigarettes and martinis, families with litters of kids cruise around in convertibles with seat-belt buckles dragging on the pavement, and the fundamentalist mother (Allison Janney) of her best friend, Penny Pinkleton (Amanda Bynes), is a bigot, as are too many others to count.
 
 Tracy's fondest dream is to become a regular dancer on the local "Corny Collins Show," which is sort of a low-rent, daytime, local "American Bandstand." But some girls, as we know, are bigger than others, some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers, and Tracy and Edna Turnblad (Travolta), who weighs somewhere in the vicinity of a freight elevator's maximum load and hasn't left the house since 1951 (it's 1962), belong squarely in the first category. Despite Edna's best efforts to dissuade her, Tracy auditions for the show when one of Corny's regular dancers goes on a nine-month sabbatical. Initially rejected, Tracy eventually gets on the show, thanks largely to the efforts of her second-fondest desire, Link Larkin (Zac Efron), the lead male dancer.
 
 Tracy's confidence and instant popularity rile station manager and former Miss Baltimore Crab, Velma Von Tussle (Michele Pfeiffer), whose teen queen daughter Amber (Brittany Snow) happens to be Link's girlfriend and dance partner. For Velma, Tracy represents the unthinkable possibility that some might value anything over skinny blond bitchiness. Other signs of Velma's badness abound, and chief among them is her unwavering commitment to keeping the "Corny Collins Show" white, with the grudging exception of a once-monthly special. "Negro Day," Tracy's favorite day of the month, is emceed by Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah), mother of the talented Seaweed (Elijah Kelley), whom Penny instantly falls for. When Velma decides to cancel "Negro Day," Tracy is confronted with a difficult choice.
 
 The plot turns on Tracy's decision between her conscience and her dreams. But the heart of movie belongs to her parents, Edna and Wilbur (Walken). As fine as the performances uniformly are — Bynes has been quietly displaying a serious comic gift for some time now; Pfeiffer is the most sublime ice queen/dragon lady/femme fatale
 to grace the screen since, I don't know, Jessica Rabbit — Travolta and Walken walk away with the movie with an easy grace that reminds you what it is that movie stars do. (And these days, it feels like, we really need reminding.) Walken's Wilbur radiates a combination of salt-of-the-earth goodness, vague tenderness and underplayed wisdom that somehow configure into an unlikely ideal husband shape — weird hair, hiked-up pants, stupid joke shop and all.
 
 When, after a terrible misunderstanding, Wilbur invites Edna to dance among the laundry in the courtyard, he looks like a man in love. And one look at Travolta explains it. It's not just the accent ("Ah'm trahn tuh ahrn here," Edna says, indicating the pile of wrinkled laundry that needs attending to), or the 44 Triple E bust-line, the mama bear instincts, or the sweet gullibility. It's not that you ever forget that you're looking at John Travolta — you don't, really. It's just that within five minutes of meeting Edna, you've completely forgotten that John Travolta was ever a man. His Edna is light-years away from the terrifying, greasy slattern created by Divine and from (I'm guessing, but it's an educated guess) miles away from Harvey Fierstein and Bruce Vilanch's interpretations. This Edna is not just any old woman, she's a real lady.
 
 
 "Hairspray." MPAA rating: PG for language, some suggestive content and momentary teen smoking. Running time: 1 hour, 57 minutes. In wide release.   

Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky), the heroine of Hairspray , is a sweetly perky high school girl with a pasty coif that flips up on each side, a grin as bright as an electric billboard, and a mood so bubblicious she's like the teenybopper Shirley Temple of 1962 Baltimore. When Tracy, who can barely focus in class, goes to audition for The Corny Collins Show , the local afternoon TV bandstand around which her life revolves, she swings, twitches, and rocks her body with jubilant abandon. This makes for a rather startling image, given Tracy's undeniably bounteous physique. Yet when she does the twist, the frug, or the mashed potato, flinging her arms back and forth, her butt twitching furiously in a tight plaid skirt, she's not just a great hoofer  she's dirty-dancing on air. In her very heftiness, she makes you feel the mad, cool acrobatic joy of each unhinged gyration.
Hairspray  is a fizzy and delirious high-camp message-movie musical that may just turn out to be the happiest movie of the summer. The opening song, ''Good Morning Baltimore,'' sets the tone: As Tracy skips through the city, singing a girl-group ditty whose big beat and Oh-oh-ohs  evoke ''Be My Baby,'' the music is pure infectious pastiche, studded with enough good hooks to get your heart bopping  and a few kinks, too, like the image of Tracy atop a garbage truck. Adam Shankman, who directed and choreographed the film, is a prosaic visual stylist  every scene has the same overbright high-gloss finish  yet he's an alchemist of movement, of high spirits made flesh, and the numbers are so exuberant they give you a tingle.
The movie was adapted from the smash-hit Broadway show (first staged in 2002), which was itself based on John Waters' blissfully cracked 1988 screen comedy. In the original film, Tracy, played by Ricki Lake, stood in for every outsider, as she joined with the black kids from the ''wrong'' side of Baltimore, who were allowed on The Corny Collins Show  only on Negro Day. The Waters movie was an anti-bigotry boogie: Tracy and her friends, with their ''race music'' moves, were the freest dancers around, and only prejudice could keep them down. That same theme dominates the new Hairspray , but with an arresting difference: Since the picture is a musical, and the unlikely image of Tracy the plus-size rock & soul whirligig is even more front and center than it was before, she's now thrilling to watch because she alone understands that pop dancing isn't about how you look while you're doing it but how you feel .
That's a message we still need to hear in an age of robo pop stars who have more cachet as fashion plates than as artists. In detention, Tracy and her pal, the uptight Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes), meet the sexy pomaded Seaweed (the electric Elijah Kelley), who dances like James Brown with wings. Tracy cops a few moves from him, and once she lands a spot on Corny Collins , her glee starts to spread everywhere, igniting a teen-integration war. Yet the heat really begins at home, where her walrus-bodied mom, Edna, played  in a triumph of casting  by John Travolta, develops from a stringy-haired agoraphobe hooked on diet pills into a vision of ''liberated'' glee. From the start, Travolta, with dottish small eyes set in a big round pancaked face that makes him look like Petunia Pig, throws us for a loop by underplaying. Speaking in a Baltimore accent that rounds each ''O'' into a plea of concern, he makes Edna tender, naive, and touchingly dear   a woman of big appetites yet tiny desires, just waiting to find her place in the world.
She finds it in the great number ''Welcome to the '60s,'' in which Tracy and Edna go shopping at Mr. Pinky's Hefty Hideaway, and the emotions of the film bust out. As Travolta starts to move that impossible body, he's a vision of unlikely grace, and you feel the freedom in every shimmy and bounce. Not all the songs work. As Edna's husband, a goof who runs a joke shop, Christopher Walken makes his befuddled detachment fun, but when he and Edna have their big romantic moment, ''(You're) Timeless to Me,'' it's so kitschy the two actors don't quite connect. For a brief period, the movie sags. I wish that Queen Latifah, as the soulful den mother Motormouth Maybelle, were playing less of a saint, and that Michelle Pfeiffer, as the villainous Velma Von Tussle, had a more memorable song to express her dragon-lady WASP disdain. But Hairspray  gets its vibe back quickly enough, and the climactic number sends you out on a high. It's called ''You Can't Stop the Beat,'' and by now it applies to a Hollywood musical revival that's in full, glorious swing.

 That “Hairspray” is good-hearted is no surprise. Adam Shankman’s film, lovingly adapted from the Broadway musical, preserves the inclusive, celebratory spirit of John Waters’s 1988 movie, in which bigger-boned, darker-skinned and otherwise different folk take exuberant revenge on the bigots and the squares who conspire to keep them down. The surprise may be that this “Hairspray,” stuffed with shiny showstoppers, Kennedy-era Baltimore beehives and a heavily padded John Travolta in drag, is actually good.  Appropriately enough for a movie with such a democratic sensibility, there is plenty of credit to go around. Mr. Shankman, drawing on long experience as a choreographer, avoids the kind of vulgar overstatement that so often turns the joy of live musical theater into torment at the multiplex. The songs, by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman, are usually adequate, occasionally inspired and only rarely inane. And they are sung with impeccable diction and unimpeachable conviction by a lively young cast that includes Nikki Blonsky, Amanda Bynes, Zac Efron and the phenomenally talented Elijah Kelley.  Of course there are better-known, more-seasoned performers on hand as well, notably Queen Latifah, Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken and Mr. Travolta. But “Hairspray” is fundamentally a story about being young — about the triumph of youth culture, about the optimistic, possibly dated belief that the future will improve on the present — and its heart is very much with its teenage heroes and the fresh-faced actors who play them.  Ms. Blonsky, a ball of happy, mischievous energy, is Tracy Turnblad, a hefty Baltimore high school student whose dream is to dance with the city’s most telegenic teeny-boppers on “The Corny Collins Show.” Ms. Bynes plays Penny Pingleton, Tracy’s timid best friend, whose prim mother (Allison Janney) won’t even let Penny watch the show, much less appear on it. Mrs. Pingleton can scarcely imagine that her daughter will eventually fall for Seaweed (Mr. Kelley), part of a group of black kids whom Tracy befriends in the detention hall after school.  As Penny and Seaweed test the taboo against interracial romance, Tracy and Link Larkin (Mr. Efron), a “Corny Collins” dreamboat, take on the tyranny of slenderness. That “Hairspray” cheerfully conflates racial prejudice with fat-phobia is the measure of its guileless, deliberately simplified politics. Upholding both forms of discrimination is Velma Von Tussle (Ms. Pfeiffer), a television station executive who uses  “The Corny Collins Show”  — against the wishes of Corny (James Marsden) himself  — as a way of maintaining the color line and promoting the celebrity of her blond, smiley daughter, Amber (Brittany Snow).  “Hairspray” does not seriously propose that Tracy and her new African-American friends face equivalent forms of injustice. But it does make the solidarity between them feel like an utterly natural, intuitive response to the meanness and arrogance of their common enemies. “Welcome to the ’60s,” Tracy sings to her mother, conjuring up the New Frontier hopefulness of that decade’s early years rather than the violence and paranoia of its denouement.  In freezing history at a moment of high possibility — a moment whose glorious popular culture encompasses “West Side Story” and the Twist, early Motown and Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound — “Hairspray” is at once knowingly corny and unabashedly utopian. On “The Corny Collins Show” Seaweed and his friends are relegated to a once-a-month Negro Day, presided over by Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah). Tracy envisions a future when, as she puts it, “every day is Negro Day.”  What is missing from “Hairspray” is anything beyond the faintest whisper of camp. The original “Hairspray” may have been Mr. Waters’s most wholesome, least naughty film, but there was no containing the volcanic audacity of Divine, who created the role of Edna Turnblad. Divine, who was born Harris Glen Milstead and who died shortly after the first “Hairspray” was released, belonged to an era when drag performance still carried more than a touch of the louche and the dangerous, and was  one of the artists who helped push it into the cultural mainstream.  Perhaps wisely Mr. Travolta does not try to duplicate the outsize, deliberately grotesque theatricality of Divine’s performance or to mimic the Mermanesque extravagance of Harvey Fierstein’s Broadway turn, choosing instead to tackle the role of Edna as an acting challenge. The odd result is that she becomes the most realistic, least stereotypical character in the film, and the only one who speaks in a recognizable (if not always convincing) Baltimore accent. (“Ahm tryna orn,” she complains when she’s trying to iron.)  A shy, unsophisticated, working-class woman, Edna is ashamed of her physical size even as she seems to hide inside it, as if seeking protection from the noise and indignity of the world outside. It is Tracy who pulls her out of her shell, and without entirely letting go of Edna’s timidity, Mr. Travolta explores the exhibitionistic and sensual sides of her personality.  Mr. Walken’s gallantry in the role of Edna’s devoted husband, Wilbur, is unforced and disarmingly sincere, and their duet, “(You’re) Timeless to Me,” is one of the film’s musical high points. Another is “Without Love,” in which the two young couples express their yearning with the help of some ingenious and amusing special effects.  There are, to be sure, less thrilling moments, and stretches in which the pacing falters. But the overall mood of “Hairspray” is so joyful, so full of unforced enthusiasm, that only the most ferocious cynic could resist it. It imagines a world where no one is an outsider and no one is a square, and invites everyone in. How can you refuse?  “Hairspray” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mildly naughty jokes and innuendo.

Director-choreographer Adam Shankman's buoyant stage-to-screen translation of "Hairspray" may not equal the comic zest of its 1988 root source, John Waters' first and still-finest mainstream feature. Nonetheless, it's one of the best Broadway-tuner adaptations in recent years -- yes, arguably even better than those Oscar-winning ones. Unpretentious, feel-good pic is low on histrionic diva wailing and MTV-style editing, high on retro movie-musical craftsmanship. Despite uneven casting among marquee thesps, it's a real crowd-pleaser. Potential sleeper could tap not just positive word-of-mouth but also various demographics underserved by the summer's pileup of CGI-heavy action.
Opening number "Good Morning Baltimore" sets the satirical yet sunny tone as rotund, irrepressible 1962 teen Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) pops out of bed, singing a sincere if slightly backhanded ode to her native burg on the way to school. Educational hours pass slowly, however, for Tracy and best friend Penny Pingleton (Amanda Bynes). They can't wait to watch local TV dance party "The Corny Collins Show," whose host (James Marsden) introduces his oh-so-perfectly-groomed juvenile regulars (collectively dubbed the Council) as "the nicest kids in town."Hogging the camera is princessy blonde Amber Von Tussle (Brittany Snow), whose viperous stage mother Velma (Michelle Pfeiffer) is the station's iron-fisted manager. Velma can barely tolerate the program's once-a-month "Negro Day," hosted by record shop owner Motormouth Maybelle (Queen Latifah).
Unbiased Tracy, however, wishes that "Every day were Negro Day!" When she's sent once again to detention ("inappropriate hair height" being the usual offense), she's delighted to find nearly everyone there is black and using their punishment time to practice hot new dance moves. She learns bump-and-grindy ones from Motormouth's son Seaweed (Elijah Kelly), which eventually get her hired as a replacement Council member on TV.
Though initially disapproving, Tracy's laundress mom Edna (John Travolta) is thrilled, as is doting, joke-shop-owning dad Wilbur (Christopher Walken), once Tracy suddenly becomes a viewer fave. The Von Tussles, of course, aren't thrilled at all -- especially since Tracy just might steal the Miss Teenage Hairspray crown from three-time winner Amber. Latter's b.f., dreamy Linc (Zac Efron), looks like he just might transfer his affection to plus-size territory as well.
One of the original pic's virtues was how it made the struggle for desegregation personal, cool and morally upright without getting preachy or solemn. The musical predictably softens that approach, caving in to Broadway/Hollywood-style inspirational uplift. That, and the fact that many of the more exciting production numbers ("I Can Hear the Bells," "Ladies' Choice," "Run and Tell That") are front-loaded in the early going, makes "Hairspray" a musical that doesn't ideally build from good to better to better-still.
Nonetheless, there's a goodwill and esprit to the whole exercise that is hard to resist. Shankman's prior films ("The Wedding Planner," "The Pacifier," "Cheaper by the Dozen 2" ) have tended to be blandly formulaic, but helmer more than rises to this occasion, maintaining the boisterous spirit of "Hairspray's" previous incarnations and packaging it in kitsch windscreen pastels that owe more to the 1955 MGM aesthetic than to MTV. Apart from some over-frenetic editing during "Welcome to the '60s," helmer exhibits a former dancer's welcome respect for letting viewers appreciate full-body motion.
It's a small disappointment that early '60s fad dance styles aren't showcased as fully as in Waters' original. But composer Marc Shaiman's songs remain a bright homage to this pre-rock, post-roll moment in top-40 bubblegum pop, R&B and gospel. The lyrics he co-wrote with Scott Wittman are often hilarious. But perhaps "Hairspray's" single most winning element is Waters' original storyline, which still delights.
Oddly, adult roles rich in comedic potential are interpreted with not-so-special flair here. Sporting a vaguely Western drawl, Travolta doesn't offer much beyond the inherent wink-wink humor of seeing a famous male actor in latex-assisted fatsuit drag. Walken, who's played the mock Eisenhower-era dad before, can't wring laughs from the joke-shop material. Their marital-devotion duet, "Timeless to Me," indulges the performers beyond the mild amusement it affords.
Pfeiffer makes Velma eminently hissable, though her villainy could've been a lot funnier. Latifah, whose comic expertise particularly shone in Shankman's "Bringing Down the House," makes Maybelle more a model of dignified reserve than a sassy "motormouth." Allison Janney (as Penny's Bible-thumping mother), Jerry Stiller (1988's Mr. Turnblad, here the proprietor of Mr. Pinky's Hefty Hideaway) and Paul Dooley (the TV station's owner) are other reliable thesps who fall a little flat.
The kids, though, are just fine. Newcomer Blonsky is cute and spunky, and has a big voice with the right early-'60s-girl-group "tear" in it -- especially in her early highlight, "I Can Hear the Bells." Efron, Snow, Bynes and Parks all score points. But the real scene-stealer is Kelley, whose self-confident Seaweed socks across perhaps the movie's single most dynamic number ("Run").
Stellar tech and design contribbers make pic a sensory treat. End credits run so long they make room for four additional soundtrack selections. Waters and original Tracy Ricki Lake make cameo appearances.

Did John Waters  sell out? Or did our ever-more-metrosexual age merely render him irrelevant? Certainly long before Hairspray  took up residence on the Great White Way in 2002, Waters had abdicated his throne as America's elder statesman of underground smut in favor of a more lucrative career as a neutered mainstream pop-culture icon, readily available for awards-show emcee gigs and sitcom guest appearances. Yet, somehow, Hairspray on Broadway seemed to seal the deal, with its further taming of Waters's already pretty tame 1988 movie, a gently satiric tale of plus-sized Baltimore teen Tracy Turnblad , who becomes an unlikely instigator of integration on an American Bandstand  like TV show at the end of the Jim Crow era. Like Mel Brooks  before him, Waters was fully gentrified now, and getting very rich as a resultthus, from shit-eating to shit-eating grin.
In truth, the stage version of Hairspray  was easily the best of the recent Broadway behemoths, even if it buried Waters's skewering of WASP panic in the face of black progress beneath thick layers of tongue-in-cheek nostalgia. You could easily walk away from the musical Hairspray thinking that racial segregation in the early '60s wasn't anything that a little blues-infused doo-wop couldn't cure, but the show was mercifully absent the labored slapstick of The Producers and the ponderous self-seriousness of Wicked . More importantly, the songs were pretty darn gooda dozen and a half clever, up-tempo numbers styled by composer-lyricist Marc Shaiman  and co-lyricist Scott Wittman  after the Top 40 hits of the era (the Angels, Jackie Wilson , et al.). And unlike the songs from Dreamgirls (which charts roughly the same period in American music history from the other side of the race divide), Shaiman and Wittman's featured an abundance of good old-fashioned soul.
Hairspray the movie musical has been conceived and executed as a faithful record of the stage version, but that's all it isa recording. Registering somewhere between Susan Stroman  (who made the abominable 2005 film version of The Producers ) and Bob Fosse  on the scale of choreographers turned directors, Adam Shankman  shows a lot of know-how when it comes to the placement and movement of human bodies, but considerably less when the object at hand is a movie camera. No, Shankman doesn't slice-and-dice his musical numbers into MTV  oblivion (à la Chicago ). But it's evident right from the opening song, "Good Morning Baltimore," in which Tracy (played here by perky newcomer Nikki Blonsky ) rolls out of bed and into a pastel universe of winos, streakers, and sewer ratsthat the movie is visually flat: not pasty and garish in the Waters signature style, but merely serviceable and competent in the worst tradition of Hollywood  "professionalism."
Shankman has gotten Hairspray on the screen, all right, but he hasn't rethought the material in cinematic terms (the way, for example, that Frank Oz  did when adapting the similarly stylized Little Shop of Horrors ). The result is an odd hybrid that lacks both the rambunctious energy of a live performance and  the expressionistic pull of a great movie musical. That leaves the film to survive on its auditory pleasures and the novelty of its stunt casting, most notably John Travolta  as Tracy's plus-plus-sized mom, Ednaa role originated (in the 1988 film) by longtime Waters muse Divine and subsequently inhabited (onstage) by such queer culture doyennes as Harvey Fierstein  and Bruce Vilanch . That most dandyish of ostensibly straight contemporary screen performers, Travolta seemed like sound castingyet, given this primo opportunity to get his femme thing on, he's oddly restrained in a part that calls for the grandiose. (I, for one, spent most of the movie trying to locate the inspiration for Travolta's slurry, monotonous vocal inflection, until I pinpointed it as a misbegotten hybrid of Ed Sullivan  and Homer Simpson .) Meanwhile, as the movie's vampish villainess Velma Von Tussle , Michelle Pfeiffer  plays all of her scenes with such shrill, white-rich-bitch intensity that, all of a sudden, Pfeiffer's lengthy screen hiatus (this is her first live-action role since White Oleander in 2002) doesn't seem to have been quite long enough.
Hairspray is far from an abject failure, but its only flashes of inspiration exist on the periphery, chiefly in Queen Latifah 's joyous performance as Motormouth Maybelle, hostess of the monthly "Negro Day" on the film's Bandstand simulacrum, The Corny Collins Show ; in Christopher Walken , too little seen as Tracy's gadget-man dad, doing some elegant soft-shoe; and in Corny Collins  himself, James Marsden , who's so adept at playing period roles (here and in The Notebook ) that you dread the thought of ever seeing him in another comic-book adaptation. Though much of the publicity surrounding Hairspray is bound to focus on the casting of tween pinup-du-jour Zac Efron  as resident Collins heartthrob Link Larkin, it's Marsdensporting enough Brylcreem  to deflect most forms of nuclear radiation, and flashing a Pepsodent  smile that could guide ships to shore in a raging monsoonwho twinkles his baby blues until he seems the epitome of the virginal 1950s innocence to which Hairspray is, ultimately, a cockeyed adieu.
