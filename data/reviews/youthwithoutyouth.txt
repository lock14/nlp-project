After 10 years, Francis Ford Coppola has returned. The real question is whether what he's come back to is filmmaking. In this patchy and ponderous mystico-historical disaster, Tim Roth plays an old professor who regresses to his hardy adulthood after being struck by lightning. He's doing ''research'' on the origins of language, but who cares when Coppola, lurching through the post-war Romanian settings, has forgotten the language of storytelling? The movie is one soporific, depressed, deadeningly vague scene after another.

 In recent years Francis Ford Coppola has been most famous for the wines he’s made, for the legacy he’s fiddled with — he released restored versions of two of his earlier films, “Apocalypse Now” and “The Outsiders” — and for the female   director he sired. It’s been 10 very long years since Sofia Coppola’s father released a new feature, but now here he is with “Youth Without Youth,” a narratively ambitious, visually sumptuous surrealist enterprise in which he has tried to bend time and space together as neatly as the folds in an origami swan.  It is a complex assemblage (closer to phoenix than swan), and by turns bewitching, inspiring, enervating and confounding. The unlikely source material is a novella by Mircea Eliade, a prolific, Romanian-born historian of religion  (1907-86),  who wrote about myth, ritual, yoga, shamanism and folklore and, among other pursuits, charted the divide between how time is experienced by so-called primitive man (cyclically) and his modern counterpart (linearly). For Dominic Matei (Tim Roth), the Romanian question mark at the center of Mr. Coppola’s adaptation of the Eliade novella, time doesn’t begin here and end there (despite the film’s opening and closing credits); it swirls like wind-scattered leaves.  The story, well, how to encapsulate someone else’s dream? In brief outline, it opens with Dominic, his body stooped and head crowned by a snowy tonsure, being struck by lightning while hurrying across a rainy Bucharest street in 1938. Subsequently hospitalized (Bruno Ganz helps care for him), Dominic loses his teeth, sprouts new ones and miraculously reverts to his physical prime, complete with a thick head of hair. Over the next few decades, through a haze of elliptical, drifting scenes, he remembers an old love (Alexandra Maria Lara), romps with a femme fatale (Alexandra Pirici), settles in Switzerland, finds a new love (Ms. Lara), absorbs libraries of knowledge, travels to India, speaks in archaic tongues and takes counsel from his intermittently visible double (Mr. Roth).  At one point in the original story Dominic asks — of himself and his double — “Will I ever succeed in demonstrating logically the reality of the exterior world?” His double assures him that the problem isn’t the reality of the exterior world, “but the objective reality of the ‘double’ or the guardian angel.” The double may not exist empirically, but he exists nonetheless, perhaps as a projection of a madman or the dream of a dying man. (We never discover which.) Whatever the case, the precise nature of Dominic’s double and the metaphysical questions it (he) inspires work well enough on the page, in part because the exterior world summoned up in the Eliade story is of course a projection of sorts — words on paper, nothing more.  It’s another matter entirely when that world is translated to a movie screen, where Dominic’s fantastical life — easy enough to absorb in written form — takes visible shape. Suddenly, instead of interesting nouns, adjectives and philosophical meditations on the divide between reality and unreality, there is Mr. Roth (or at least his representation), wearing early-20th-century clothing and pushing through a thicket of narrative complication. He looks somewhat baffled, though that may admittedly be my own projection. Mr. Coppola has created some strikingly beautiful images in “Youth Without Youth” — his framing remains impeccable, as does his sense of color, proportion and pictorial harmony — but too many of these lovely, mysterious visions have the aspect of private reveries, dreams still locked inside the dreamer’s head.  In part Mr. Coppola seems to be trying to put into visual terms Mr. Eliade’s notion of personal “holy places.” In his book “The Sacred and the Profane” Mr. Eliade writes that our lives contain privileged areas — the scenes of first love, the first foreign city we visit when we’re young — that reveal a reality beyond our ordinary existence. And because we experience different realities, thresholds — like those found between the street and the church — are of great importance. “The threshold is the limit,” he writes, “the boundary, the frontier that distinguishes and opposes two worlds — and at the same time the paradoxical place where those worlds communicate, where passage from the profane to the sacred world becomes possible.” He might as well be writing about the street and the movie theater.  Not long ago Mr. Coppola — whose greatest films have long been holy places for some of us — wrote that his adaptation of “Youth Without Youth” is “all about” consciousness. (“The reality in which we live is beyond our immediate perceptions.”) I think it’s all about movies, the pre-eminent mind-machine of the modern age, and the desire of an older, established, long-dormant director to tap into creative (metaphoric) youth by exploring some of the same cinematic concerns that possessed modernist filmmakers like Antonioni. In this film Mr. Coppola blurs dreams and everyday life and suggests that through visual and narrative experimentation he has begun the search for new ways of making meaning, new holy places for him and for us. He may not have found them yet, but, then, he’s just waking up.  “Youth Without Youth” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gun violence, sexual congress, female nudity, metaphysics.

Not just fans of Francis Ford Coppola will be disappointed by the mishmash plotting and stilted script of �Youth Without Youth,� the master�s first helming effort in 10 years. Overly talky tale spans the mid-20th century, following an elderly professor whose miraculous return to youth offers the chance to complete his magnum opus and rediscover lost love. Attempting to harness multiple genres, pic is brought down by ponderous dialogue (much of it dubbed) and an inability to connect with its characters. Limited bicoastal opening is set for Dec. 14, though �Youth Without Youth� will translate to cinemas without audiences.
Long stuck on completing his unrealized �Megalopolis� project, Coppola found Romanian philosopher/author Mircea Eliade�s novella about the limitations of time a compensating balm for his own frustrations. Perhaps Eliade�s investigations into Jungian theory and a nascent form of New Age spirituality also appealed, not to mention the excitement of getting back to the kind of artistic control only possible with low-budget filmmaking.Decamping to Romania (with a small section shot in Bulgaria), Coppola used mostly young local talent and had the Balkan nations stand in for Switzerland, Malta and even India. Unfortunately, the results are as phony as the back projection and lack the kind of Eastern European magical realism that would have made it resonate.
On the eve of WWII, brilliant Professor Dominic Matei (Tim Roth) despairs at ever finishing his life�s work, a study of the origin of languages. Still grieving for Laura (Alexandra Maria Lara), who broke off their engagement 40 years earlier, Dominic journeys from his home in northeastern Romania to Bucharest, where he�s struck by lightning right before a suicide attempt.
Not only does he miraculously survive, but Dominic�s whole body reverts from his 70-year-old state to the youthful, priapic self he was decades earlier. His doctor, kindly Professor Stanciulescu (Bruno Ganz) is keen to study this remarkable transformation, but as word spreads, the Nazis come calling, in the guise of a voluptuous woman known simply as the �Woman in Room 6� (Alexandra Pirici). Stanciulescu is suspicious; could it be that subtle swastika on the woman�s garter belt?
Meanwhile, out of Dominic�s fevered dreams comes another Dominic, a doppelganger representing his purely scientific side. Like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde if the two ever spoke directly, the �good� Dominic becomes enthralled by his crueler, colder other half, who views his regeneration as a means of accomplishing the Faustian goal of achieving all knowledge. Soon Dominic merely has to pass his hand over a closed book � to the cheesy accompaniment of unearthly light and electric sizzles � and the contents are transferred to his advanced brain.
But the Nazis are in pursuit, so he heads off to Switzerland, helped by a border guard who assures him, in just one of numerous stilted lines, �My cooperation with the Nazis is only symbolic.� All this added intelligence turns Dominic into a Jason Bourne of sorts as he expertly forges new papers for himself (but wait, here�s Bourne himself, as an uncredited Matt Damon unsuccessfully offers the protection of the U.S. government).
Jump to 1955, and Dominic chances upon a dead ringer for his lost love, now named Veronica, cowering in a cave after a car crash and speaking only Sanskrit. Discovery forces Dominic to choose whether or not to seize the opportunity to complete his research, at the expense of Veronica�s ability to lead a normal life. 
By the time this stage is reached, the serial-worthy plot has moved through any number of genres without holding onto any of them. Perhaps Coppola�s affinity for a character obsessed by unrealized projects was too close to allow him to see the piecemeal nature of his script, bogged down by endless chatter. Immortality and the ramifications of eternal life, on both ethical and emotional levels, have been dealt with much more effectively in works varying from �The Picture of Dorian Gray� (referenced toward the end) and Janacek�s superb, emotionally resonant opera �The Makropoulos Case,� a far more powerful analysis of the cruelty of time.
Presumably, Coppola chose to dub most of the film because the non-native English speakers needed help to make their lines clear, but the device, though generally well done, does nothing to help lackluster delivery in the minor roles. Roth certainly knows how to hold the screen, though surprisingly for such a fine actor, he resorts to lip-curling and similar tics to signal the difference between the two Dominics. Ganz has little to do, while the lovely Lara (�Downfall�) struggles not to appear ridiculous as she spouts ancient tongues in scenes that could have come from old Universal �Mummy� flicks. Just like Virginia Christine, she deserves better.
Shot largely with a fixed camera, lensing by young Romanian d.p. Mihai Malaimare Jr. favors basic but not dull formats, with many scenes either bathed in a golden light or a moon-blue glow. While Balkan locations don�t completely convince as Malta or India, that�s a minor quibble, especially considering pic�s overall deliberate, often attractive artificiality. Occasional sideways and upside-down shots, however, contribute nothing, while Osvaldo Golijov�s overly sweet orchestrations give too much away too soon.
Print screened in Rome lacked closing credits. 


Youth Without Youth , Francis Ford Coppola 's self-financed return to the fray, is a curious projectwell-crafted, personal, and movie-movie old-fashioned even in its vanguard aspirations. Simply put, it's a Faustian romance about the reversal of time and transmigration of souls which, shot mainly in Romania , adds a soupçon of Balkan chic and anti-Nazi iconography to its rich stew of twaddle.
Coppola's source is a novella by the historian of religion Mircea Eliade  (19071986). A more scholarly sort of Joseph Campbell , long ensconced at the University of Chicago , Eliade provided what might have been footnotes to Marvel comics Thor  and Dr. Strange ; back in the day, his The Sacred and the Profane  and The Myth of the Eternal Return  were earnestly pondered by academic acid-heads like myself. But the professor had a second life, composing fictions akin to Borgesian brain-twisters.
Youth Without Youth , which Eliade wrote late in life, is one of these. Dominic Matei  (Tim Roth ) is an aging professor of linguistics and a self-described failure. It's Easter Day 1938 with "War Clouds Over Romani," per the newspaper headline. The weather is freakish. Dominic is actually planning to kill himselfwhen he's struck by lightning. "A man who survives being struck by lighting is completely changed," Eliade observed in an account of Siberian shamans. "He is a new man." So it is with Dominic. He suffers massive burns, yet his hair grows back luxuriantly and his rotting teeth are replaced by new ones.
Inexplicably younger and immeasurably smarter, the old linguist is about to have his second chance. He learns Chinese in a flash, the mystery of his newfound abilities abetted by intoxicating cimbalom music. Meanwhile, his doctor (Bruno Ganz ) ponders not only this unique medical case but the international situation: "France is abandoning us to the Nazis." Romanian secret police are after Dominic and, after infiltrating a medical exam, the Nazis are too. The Gestapo  plants a seductive agent (Alexandra Pirici ) in the room next-door; a treacherous hottie, she's got a swastika on her garter and a copy of Mein Kampf  beneath the sheets.
Coppola has made no secret that he takes Youth Without Youth  personally. "I'm really a lot like the man in the movie," he eagerly told A.O. Scott  in the Times . The filmmaker might as well have compared himself to Eliade, whose spiritual autobiography he's appropriated. At 70, Dominic is virtually the same age as Eliade was when he wrote the novel, which revisits the period of his flirtation with fascism. The young Eliade admired Mussolini  and the local Iron Guard, calling for "a nationalist Romania, frenzied and chauvinistic, armed and vigorous." During the war, he served as a cultural attaché in Portugal  (celebrating its dictator Salazar as a mystical savior).
These political indiscretions, which might have provided the basis for another sort of thriller, became widely known only after Eliade's deathand Coppola alludes to them in an oblique fashion. Whether out of a desire to protect the writer or admiration for Raiders of the Lost Ark , he ramps up the story's anti-Nazi credentials. Once it becomes known that Hitler  himself is interested in "the most valuable human specimen today on the face of the earth," Dominic is spirited to neutral Switzerland , where an uncredited Matt Damon  materializes as a helpful American agent, and there our hero ponders his fate: "The war rages around me. . . . My Romanian homeland has made a pact with the devil [and] I am a strange superman of the future." Indeed, this superman appears to turn the tide of war in favor of the Allies by an act of will.
A decade later, lightning strikes againand again. The ever-young octogenarian is hiking through the Alps when he encounters a new incarnation of his long-lost student love in the form of the young Swiss tourist Veronica (Alexandra Maria Lara , who played Hitler's secretary in Downfall ). The sky darkens and a thunderbolt leaves her babbling in Sanskrit. Apparently, she's possessed by the soul of a seventh-century Indian princess, which doesn't impede their going off to Malta  for a bit of happy canoodling. But miracles are capricious. Veronica's changes are not the same as Dominic's. She begins aging. . . .
Second childhood or old man's folly? Coppola has made more than his share of bombastic melodramas. But for all its fussy lighting, upside-down camera angles, and overwrought impressionism, Youth Without Youth  is essentially playful. It's also pleasantly meandering in its largely faked locations, and drolly matter-of-fact about its mystic visions ("That stranger in your dream was probably Shiva"). Heading a dubbed Romanian cast, Roth manages the illusion of taking it all seriouslymaking up in conviction what he lacks in charisma.
From its charmingly retro credits through its Third Man  atmospherics to its bingo-bongo decade-collapsing climax, Youth Without Youth  is a cinematic time machineat once sillier and more desperate in its convictions than such kindred trips to the mystic East as Bertolucci's Little Buddha  or Scorsese's Kundun . Variety  has predicted that Youth Without Youth  will translate to "cinemas without audiences," as if that were the point. This is hardly Coppola's greatest movie, but it's far from his worstits bid for a new beginning is one from the heart.
