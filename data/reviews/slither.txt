At last: the mutant alien redneck zombie movie the world has been waiting for. "Slither" is cheap, disgusting, and ridiculous; it's also smart, very funny, and knowingly in touch with its B-movie roots. The faint of heart should skip it, but if your guilty-pleasure tastes run to such storied horror-comedies as "Re-Animator" and "Tremors," here's your cup of extraterrestrial gastropod guts.
Before a meteor lands on the edge of town, not much happens in Wheelsy besides deer season and inbreeding. Mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry) is a blow-dried pottymouth, while police chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion of "Serenity") pines for his childhood sweetheart, schoolteacher Starla (Elizabeth Banks). Unfortunately, she's married to Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), the macho blowhard who's Wheelsy's leading citizen.
Even more unfortunately, Grant gets too close to a pulsing pile of slime in the woods, and soon he's haunting the deli counter at the supermarket, growling, "Meat
." Say what you will about the man, he does love his wife, even after he transforms into a giant tentacled slime monster. The mayor's convinced it's just Lyme disease; the police aren't so sure and plot their quarry's whereabouts on a map with little squid icons.
Every worthwhile horror movie since "Alien" has its carefully worked out evolutionary calculus, and "Slither" is no different. One of Grant's early victims becomes a giant human womb that releases millions of blood-red slugs that fan out across town, leaping into people's mouths and turning them into zombies controlled by the Grant/alien thingie. This means that whenever Starla encounters one of the undead, he or she insists on working out the couple's domestic issues. Can you do
 couples therapy with a hive mind?
The slug-attack sequences are giddy and terrifying -- drive-in cheese at its creepiest -- and the bathtub scene lives up to its billing on the film's poster. "Slither" does for taking a good, long soak what "Jaws" did for swimming in the ocean.
As rousing as it is, the gore's for the diehards. What makes a good horror-comedy work -- as opposed to all the teen dice-and-slice "product" that clogs up multiplexes -- is sharp performances, sharper timing, and a willingness to admit to the genre's fundamental silliness.
"Slither" has all three. The acting is playful aces all around: Fillion gives good exhausted incredulity, Banks gives good virginal idiocy, and Rooker gives great conflicted monster arrogance even before the aliens get him. The film moves forward with the relentlessness of a low-budget nightmare, pausing every so often to point, giggle, shriek, and run away.
Writer-director James Gunn has been around the block, and "Slither" is a winking resume of his influences. The town's beer joint is named Henenlotter's in honor of the director of the grindhouse classic "Basket Case" (1982), while David Cronenberg's 1975 "They Came From Within" gets a viscous shout-out. Gunn earned his stripes writing scripts for the Z-movie studio Troma, which accounts for the company's president, Lloyd Kaufman, showing up in a cameo as a wino. He also wrote the recent "Dawn of the Dead" remake, which explains this movie's deep knowledge of zombie behavioral habits (i.e., they never run but can only totter).
Still, it's Gunn's love of the absurd that keeps "Slither" sailing along its bloody track. After a series of developments that raise the ick factor to jaw-dropping levels, the movie scores the climactic showdown between Starla and what used to be her husband to the couple's favorite song. Who knew that when Air Supply recorded its gloriously sappy 1980 hit "Every Woman in the World," it would find its true meaning as the expression of the love between a woman and her slug.

         No relation to the wacky 1973 James Caan-Peter Boyle-Sally Kellerman laugher of the same title, "Slither" is an uproarious hybrid horror-comedy about a small town visited by a rapidly evolving, unearthly organism that gives new meaning to the phrase "divide and conquer." Written and directed by James Gunn, a veteran of Lloyd Kaufman's Troma Entertainment, the film is an affectionate shout-out to low-budget 1980s gore-fests.
 
  What at first appears to be a meteor firing through the Earth's atmosphere crash-lands in the woods near Wheelsy, S.C. It splits open like an egg and out crawls a fat, worm-like creature that leaves a gooey trail in its wake.
 


         






    The unsuspecting residents of the burg, a more populated South Atlantic cousin to "Northern Exposure's" Cicely, Alaska, go about their business of preparing for deer hunting season. The town's sardonic sheriff, Bill Pardy, is played by Nathan Fillion, late of "Firefly" and "Serenity," who brings an air of cool detachment to the role, wryly observing his crazier neighbors.
 
  Stoic, bullet-headed local businessman Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), is an overachiever in the matrimonial department, but his amorous advances are rebuffed by his beautiful blond high school science teacher wife, Starla (Elizabeth Banks). Grant then sulks off to a bar, where Brenda (Brenda James), the younger sister of an ex-girlfriend, makes a pass at him. The tipsy couple wander into the woods to get cozy, and they spot the slimy creature, which promptly launches a needle-like probe into Grant's abdomen.
 
  The next thing he knows he has an unquenchable hunger for raw meat. Neighborhood pets begin disappearing and nasty, red pustules form on his body. His metamorphosis is rapid as he turns Brenda into a repository for his feasts, and the sheriff forms a posse to hunt for Grant — who now resembles a bipedal squid — in the forest.
 
  Joining Sheriff Pardy and Starla, who were childhood sweethearts, are strong-willed teen Kylie (Tania Saulnier) and the profanity-spewing Mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry in a delicious parody of blowhard small-town politicians). The performances are well-balanced in relationship to the film's tone with underplayed quips playing off broad visual humor. Likewise, the music is an appropriate mix of a big, brassy score and eclectic songs. Air Supply's "Every Woman in the World" is used as a very funny recurring motif while the Old 97s sing "The New Kid" over the closing credits.
 
  Gunn cleverly borrows from an assortment of classic horror subgenres as the Grant monster unleashes an unforeseeable arsenal of organic, virally potent weaponry. The result is a parade of multiplying, blood-red slugs and hungry zombies terrorizing the remaining humans. Just when you think things can't get worse, they do. "Slither" is a gross, disgusting, but undeniably amusing treat laden with homages and in-jokes.
 
 "Slither"

 
 MPAA rating:
 R for strong horror violence and gore, and language   

Slither  lays on the monsters and zombies and ooze, but the very last reaction writer-director James Gunn is going for is a simple ''Oh, my!'' He'll take ''Eek,'' he'll accept ''Ick,'' he'd love ''Ha-ha-ha-ha''  the more visceral the response the better for the Troma alumnus who wrote 2004's sparkling, ''reimagined'' Dawn of the Dead . And if he can't get a rise out of an audience weaned on John Carpenter movies, he'll just throw more putrefying effects on the screen.
So sue me, sometimes after a day of enjoying Belgian film-festival prizewinners, I like to relax with copious servings of horror-flick slime and a good visual joke involving squids, girls in bathtubs, and overhead cameras. Here, Gunn lovingly hacks up the whole horror-comedy genre with the giddily disgusting tale of Wheelsy, a Southern town infested by alien slugs. The mother sucker from outer space enters the neighborhood through the host body of a local lout superfluously named Grant Grant (Michael Rooker from Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer   killer casting). Her babies in turn transform their human prey into zombies. The zombies go gaga in the streets. And pretty soon the only uninfected folks are chief of police Bill Pardy (Serenity 's Nathan Fillion), the town's dumdum mayor (Payback 's Gregg Henry), an all-purpose neighbor teen (Tania Saulnier, in the bathtub), and Grant's pretty wife, Starla (Elizabeth Banks from The 40 Year-Old Virgin , hilarious as a classic Hitchcock blonde), for whom Pardy has long carried a torch.
There are times (and plenty of them) when Slither slops over from smart, affectionate homage into unmodulated frat goofiness as Gunn cannibalizes so many horror plots with such high spirits. Well, what do you expect from a comedy that hollers ''Goo riddance!''?

 The slimy little creatures that wiggle into the mouths of the seriously freaked-out characters in the horror film "Slither" are meant to have originated in space. In truth, these delightfully repellent critters, which look like fast-moving leeches, squirmed out of the brainpan of the film's writer and director, James Gunn, a horror savant who has obviously put in some time with the collected works of both George A. Romero and David Cronenberg. Mr. Romero's zombie nation lives in shadow form in "Slither," a film about a fecund extraterrestrial with an insatiable appetite for flesh. But it's Mr. Cronenberg's early career interest in oozing orifices and spiky protuberances that seems to have left the biggest impression on Mr. Gunn.  There are plenty of orifices, protuberances and ooze in "Slither," along with enough raw meat to suggest that despite the usual disclaimer about no animals being harmed during this production, PETA  will soon be on the march. The monster that spawns all those slithering creepy-crawlers has a cattleman's appetite for filet mignon. (What's for dinner? A cow.) The monster also has a taste for cat and dog, and a deep affection for the little lady its host body, a small-town tough named Grant (Michael Rooker — Henry in "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"), was forced to leave behind.  Her name is Starla (Elizabeth Banks), and Starla's smile still shines bright even after her husband, Grant, has transformed into a fairly unnerving Jabba the Hutt look-alike. "Marriage," she says, "is a sacred bond."  So are movies, or that's the idea, anyway. The pleasure of horror isn't simply that the best films make your toes curl and force you to check the locks, but that they require a particularly strong connection between the audience and the director. Like comedy, horror is difficult to master because it requires nuance. So many contemporary horror films just pour on the blood and sadism; it's absurdly easy to grab the audience's attention simply by sawing off an arm. Real horror demands more than a romp in a charnel house; it requires dread, mystery, awe. It also requires that the audience, a tough crowd well accustomed to all manner of aestheticized butchery, suspend its cool long enough for a director to deliver the goods.  Mr. Gunn is credited with writing the very good remake of Mr. Romero's zombie classic "Dawn of the Dead," which shouldn't have worked but did because it both followed the genre rules and bent them, mostly by making the zombies move frighteningly fast, just as they do in Danny Boyle's "28 Days Later." The accelerated pace might have seemed heretical (and Mr. Romero himself remains a firm adherent of the slow-moving undead), but it was just the kind of tweak that can make a familiar setup seem fresh. In similar fashion, while "Slither" sometimes feels like a monster-mash, what makes it work is how nimbly it slaloms from yucks to yuks, slip-sliding from horror to comedy and back again on its gore-slicked foundation.  The humor tends to skew toward the obvious and goofy, though some of the best jokes are also the more understated, as when the would-be hero chief of police, Bill Pardy (the very fine Nathan Fillion, late of "Serenity"), on his way to a showdown with the monster with a posse of heavily armed deputies, pauses to lock his car with a chirping remote key. This small, inane gesture effectively puts the action on pause, drawing out the tension, and underscores the ordinariness of the designated good guy (even while suggesting that he may not be quite up to the challenge). It also makes you think about logistics, a critical component of a genre that demands a certain pragmatic savvy from its characters.  The characters who make it out of a horror film alive seem to come equipped with a kind of survival manual: they know how to plunge a stake through the vampire's heart and when to fire a silver bullet. The men and women in "Slither" seem fairly hapless by comparison: their guns don't do the trick, and the grenade the police department keeps locked away looks as if it's been gathering dust since the fall of Saigon. Mr. Gunn doesn't seem interested in stirring the pot with politics, but not long before the big finish, Bill turns to a teenage girl (Tania Saulnier) and tells her how, when it's all over, he will need to be remembered as the hero of this story. Even as the monster stands poised to wipe out the town, this guy is thinking only about his image.  "Slither" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gore galore.

"Slither" is a gleefully nasty and ingeniously twisted horror-comedy that pits a populace of heavily armed but mostly clueless rednecks against flesh-eating zombies, slimy extraterrestrial slugs and an acid-spewing, multitentacled mutant. Call it "Night of the Living Dead" meets "Tremors." Scripter James Gunn infuses the pic, his debut feature as a director, with the exuberance of a movie geek given carte blanche to play fast and loose with the cliches and conventions of his favorite films. Result is a rock-the-house crowd-pleaser for genre aficionados, though its breakout potential appears iffy.
Gunn -- a Troma Entertainment alumnus whose writing credits range from "Scooby Doo" to 2004's "Dawn of the Dead" remake -- deftly balances broad humor, rude shocks and gross-out special effects for a fang-in-cheek extravaganza that often feels like a slightly more upscale version of cheapie-creepy Troma product.
Wheelsy, the kind of small town where the start of hunting season is celebrated as a local holiday, is where Grant Grant (Michael Rooker), a wealthy but none-too-refined businessman, somehow managed to claim Starla (Elizabeth Banks), a local beauty, as his trophy wife. Trouble is, Starla has grown tired of fulfilling her conjugal duties.
Stung by Starla's latest rejection, Grant seeks solace in a seedy bar, where tarty Brenda (Brenda James) proves far more receptive to his sex appeal. Unfortunately, when the couple decides to take a walk in the nearby woods, they come across a recently landed meteorite. Something emerges from within -- and plunges into Grant.
For the first half-hour or so, "Slither" seems to be a seriocomic riff on sci-fi thrillers in which hapless humans are infected by extraterrestrial contamination or manmade maladies. As such, the pic often echoes David Cronenberg's "Rabid" and John Carpenter's remake of "The Thing."
But by the time Grant evolves into a toothy, slime-encrusted behemoth with a pronounced resemblance to a squid, and Brenda expands to become a humongous breeder of malignant slugs, it's clear Gunn won't be content to reference only one kind of monster. Much to the great distress of dry-witted police chief Bill Pardy (Nathan Fillion) and blowhard mayor Jack MacReady (Gregg Henry), the victims of the malignant slugs won't stay dead. Rather, the dearly departed reawaken as staggering, shambling zombies, mentally connected to Grant, an increasingly more powerful (and more disgusting) entity.
"Slither" begins briskly, gradually accelerates and eventually achieves a breakneck momentum that makes the wild ride even more exhilarating. Here and there, though, pic slows down for a clever bit of throwaway lunacy, like the revelation that Wheelsy has a karaoke bar.
The special effects are a nifty mix of old-school prosthetics and high-tech CGI, making for a few genuinely shocking moments amid the farcical facade. Overall tech values are smartly dedicated to making "Slither" appear polished, but not too 
polished, so it can impress without straying too far from its B-movie roots.
The well-cast actors -- including Tania Saulnier as a feisty teen whose family gets slugged -- go just far enough over the top to maintain the jokey/scary tone without becoming cartoonish. Fillion is particularly amusing while delivering wisecracks and ironic asides with the same sly spin he brought to cheeky dialogue in the cult fave "Firefly" TV series (and, more recently, its "Serenity" feature spinoff). For all his funny moments, however, Fillion also rises to the challenge of being, relatively speaking, the straight man, or at least the pic's voice of sanity. Henry gets big laughs with a much-bigger-than-life approach. And Rooker is surprisingly sympathetic even as his character turns into a special effect.
Incidentally, the film has absolutely nothing to do with Howard Zieff's 1973 pic of the same name, starring James Caan and Sally Kellerman. Latter also was a comedy but had no slugs to speak of and nary a single zombie.

Good zombie movies are metaphorical; Slither  allegorizes living-dead horror as a critique of the American heartland's boundless gluttony. The film's aliens enter their victims through the mouth or stomach and compel people to consume endless quantities of meatthey grow so morbidly obese that they literally explode with extraterrestrial evil. Writer-director James Gunn , who wrote Tromeo  & Juliet  and the Dawn of the Dead  remake, is obviously a fan of the genre, and he's filled his movie with an encyclopedic onslaught of cinematic references: the town bar, for instance, is named Henenlotter's after the director of 1982's Basket Case , whose creature bears more than a passing resemblance to some of Slither 's. The larger plot is a blend of Night of the Living Dead  and Cronenberg's version of The Fly : the decimation of a small town overrun by flesh-craving space slugs set against a love triangle among the aliens' first victim, his wife, and the town sheriff (Michael Rooker , Elizabeth Banks , and Nathan Fillion , respectively). Gunn doesn't reinvent the wheel but he does tighten its spokes a bit with some terrifying sequences and a witty, deadpan screenplay, and he leaves the audience hungryfor Slither 2 .
