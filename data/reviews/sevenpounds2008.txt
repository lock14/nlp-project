Back when Will Smith was first making the unprecedented leap from novelty rapper to World�s Biggest Movie Star, he tended to rely more on his charm than his acting ability to win over audiences. Looking to be his generation�s answer to Harrison Ford, he romped his way through action movies with an air of unquestioned confidence, knowing his undeniable screen presence, deftness with a one-liner, and million-kilowatt smile would be enough to rally filmgoers to his side � in the process forgoing the subtler tones that were at his command, as demonstrated by earlier, more nuanced, performances in small dramas such as Six Degrees of Separation
. In the last few years, however, Smith the actor has begun to reassert himself, pushing Smith the dazzling, larger-than-life, box-office phenomenon into the shadows. First came Ali
, then The Pursuit of Happyness
, movies that were conspicuously lacking in that peculiar blend of goofball sincerity, self-mocking street toughness, and Dennis the Menace deviance that defined the Fresh Prince persona. Even his action roles started turning noticeably dour: I Am Legend
 and Hancock
 may have been marketed as bubbly comic-book trifles, but they were really about existential collapse, more concerned with survival than heroism. No longer was Smith the guy in the room everybody loved; now he was the only
 guy in the room, with all his imperfections on display � a character straight out of Camus, if Camus had ever bothered to write about flesh-eating zombies. Now, with Seven Pounds
, the transformation of Will Smith is complete: Gone is any trace of love-me impishness, replaced by one of the sourest pusses Hollywood has seen since Joaquin Phoenix got his Screen Actors Guild card. Smith plays Ben Thomas, a once-successful engineer who was involved in an auto accident years before and who now leads a desperate life of self-loathing and regret. Seeking out the most effective and productive means of self-flagellation, he devises an elaborate scheme of charity/contrition designed to save strangers� lives through the abandonment of his own. I�m reluctant to say too much about the plot of Seven Pounds
, as director Muccino (reuniting with his Happyness
 star) and writer Grant Nieporte have gone through pains to keep viewers in a state of suspended half-confusion, but it is safe to reveal that Ben�s work involves helping damaged souls barely hanging on to society�s bottom rung, in particular a beautiful young woman (Dawson) who has a congenital heart defect but enough heart to nudge Ben toward something resembling absolution. Throughout the film, Smith proves himself adept in the art of conflicted melancholy � always speaking at the wrong volume, rarely looking people in the eye, all 1,000-yard stares and forced smiles � and Muccino responds to his star�s seriousness with enough darkness and moral ambivalence to keep his story from toppling into heartwarming, pay-it-forward mawkishness. Together they�ve proved the once-unimaginable theory that Smith is more likable the less he tries to make us like him.


Will Smith is a troubled IRS agent in 'Seven Pounds'
"Seven Pounds" opens with Ben Thomas (Will Smith) making a 911 call regarding his upcoming suicide.
I'd like to make a 911 call myself: Lord, please stop this increasingly fine actor from climbing onto another cross.
Smith is a movie star, not a martyr. When he suffers here, boy, do we all. The last thing anyone wants is to dissuade an actor of Smith's magnetism from exploring the bounds of his charisma and his talent. But this vat of chicken soup for the soul does no one any favors. Unless, of course, you happen to be one of the folks lucky enough to receive what Ben is giving.
This is the sort of movie that leaves you with too many questions. What, for instance, is up with Ben having a pet jellyfish? Why is he calling a blind telephone operator (Woody Harrelson) and mocking his sightlessness? Why, when Ben hangs up, does he weep a bit then beat his coffee table with an expensive-looking chair? Why, whenever he talks to his best friend (Barry Pepper), does the best friend fall to pieces? Why does Ben sign his beach house over to a Mexican family, move into a motel, and continue to stalk sickly Emily Posa (Rosario Dawson, looking her luscious self even at death's door)? How, if Ben is so suicidally depressed, does he still get his hair to have that perfect S-Curl sheen? (That's not easy to do when you want to live.) How does any of this relate to his work as an IRS agent? And most crucially: Seven pounds of what?
Amid all this, there are flashbacks to a time when Ben knew how to smile. Apparently, those were the days. Then Something Happened. Now he acts like the illegitimate child of Jeff Bridges in "Starman" and Della Reese on "Touched by an Angel." Everything is explained, but long after we're owed clarity of some kind. Or maybe the explanation is just underwhelming.
"Seven Pounds" is exasperating because it doesn't seem to know how exasperating all its ambiguity can be. The film's chronology has been decentralized so we don't really know where in time we are, and Gabriele Muccino directs the stuffing out of everything in the name of achieving the loping artiness you maybe recall from "Babel" and "21 Grams," two movies made in collaboration between director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and screenwriter Guillermo Arriaga.
The script for "Seven Pounds" is by Grant Nieporte, whose credits include writing for the sitcoms "8 Simple Rules . . ." and "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch." Before banging out his first screenplay, he appears to have spent a weekend watching the tortured fruits of Inarritu and Arriaga's labor. "Seven Pounds" strives for similar unliftable heaviness but lacks even the grand ponderousness of an Inarritu-Arriaga production. The movie is a doorstop that thinks it's a statue.
A couple of years ago, Muccino got an astonishing piece of acting out of Smith in "The Pursuit of Happyness," in which he created one of the most realistic renderings of a parent I've ever seen in a movie. Smith is just as achy-breaky in "Seven Pounds." But the urgency of being a broke, homeless single dad gave the actor real problems to react to. This new movie keeps quiet about what's eating Ben for far too long. We don't know what he's reacting to. Smith manages to be engaging, anyway. It doesn't matter whether he's bathing with that jellyfish or trying, with Dawson, to hit the glass-breaking high notes of Minnie Riperton's "Lovin' You."
But too often the movie's preposterous ideas of goodly sacrifice blur the line between altruism and self-importance. As a rapper, Smith's charm was always that he could brag without ever seeming conceited. (Remember "I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson"?) That unlikely wholesomeness is what's keeping him the world's most dependable movie star. But here there's something unseemly about Ben's virtue. His charitable give-away is really a ludicrous act of hubris.
Smith in "Seven Pounds" is looking to be more than a saint, a god, or some good Samaritan. Hilariously, the man wants the impossible: He wants to be Oprah.


In Seven Pounds , an unintentionally ludicrous drama of repentance as an extreme sport, a humorless, impenetrable Will Smith  plays a guy  who's really rich, really apologetic about mistakes he's made in the past, and really, by any sane moviegoer's measure, kind of nuts. (He may or may not be an IRS agent;  he definitely keeps a deadly jellyfish as a pet in his seedy motel room.) Poor Rosario Dawson  looks lovely but lost as a beautiful woman with a real-not-metaphorical  failing heart; Woody Harrelson  looks ready for an SNL  sketch as a gentle, blind telephone operator and pianist. Do not attempt  these acts of atonement at home.

 “Seven Pounds,” which reunites Will Smith with Gabriele Muccino (who directed him in “The Pursuit of Happyness”), begins with a series of riddling, chronologically scrambled scenes. A man calls 911 to report his own suicide. He badgers a blind call-center employee — whom we suspect will be a significant character, since he’s played by Woody Harrelson — with complaints and insults. He embraces a lovely woman in an even lovelier beach house. He visits a nursing home where he terrorizes an administrator and comforts a resident.  For a while it is pleasant enough to contemplate these loose ends, and to tease from them the possible contours of a story. It is never unpleasant to watch Mr. Smith, who likes to play peekaboo with his charm, hiding it now and then behind fleeting shadows of anguish or malice. The music (Angelo Milli’s score and a handful of emotive pop songs) combines with the deep colors of Philippe Le Sourd’s cinematography to summon up intensities of sentiment not yet arrived at by the narrative, creating an interesting frisson of suspense. After a while, though, as the pieces of the puzzle snap together, curiosity gives way to incredulity.  Near the end of “Seven Pounds” a carefully laminated piece of paper appears, on which someone has written, “DO NOT TOUCH THE JELLYFISH.”  I wouldn’t dream of it, and I’ll take the message as a warning not to divulge the astonishing things that happen, not all of them involving aquatic creatures.  Frankly, though, I don’t see how any review could really spoil what may be among the most transcendently, eye-poppingly, call-your-friend-ranting-in-the-middle-of-the-night-just-to-go-over-it-one-more-time crazily awful motion pictures ever made. I would tell you to go out and see it for yourself, but you might take that as a recommendation rather than a plea for corroboration. Did I really see what I thought I saw?  And I wish I could spell out just what that was, but you wouldn’t believe me, and the people at Sony might not invite me to any more screenings. So instead of spelling out what happens in “Seven Pounds,” I’ll just pluck a few key words and phrases from my notes, and arrange them in the kind of artful disorder Mr. Muccino seems to favor (feel free to start crying any time):  Eggplant parmesan. Printing press. Lung. Bone marrow. Eye transplant. Rosario Dawson. Great Dane. Banana peel. Jellyfish (but you knew that already). Car accident. Congestive heart failure.  Huh? What the ... ? Hang on. What’s he doing? Why? Who does he think he is? Jesus! That last, by the way, is not an exclamation of shock but rather an answer to the preceding question, posed with reference to Mr. Smith. Lately he has taken so eagerly to roles predicated on heroism and world-saving self-sacrifice — see “I Am Legend” and “Hancock” — that you may wonder if he has a messiah clause in his contract. Which is not to say that he doesn’t show range in these films, in which he credibly plays a research scientist, a dissolute superhero and, in this latest one, an I.R.S. agent.  An I.R.S. agent who wants only to help people. This is a nice, small joke that provides a few grace notes of levity in what is otherwise a lugubrious exercise in spiritual bushwa.  For all its pious, earnest air, “Seven Pounds” cries out to be remade as an Asian horror movie, so that the deep, creepy grotesqueness of its governing premise might be allowed to flourish, rather than to fester beneath the surface.  As it is, the movie is basically an inverted, twisted tale of revenge. Ben Thomas, Mr. Smith’s character, is in essence a benevolent vigilante, harassing, stalking and spying on unsuspecting citizens for their own good, and also to punish himself. Why such misery should also be inflicted on an innocent, affirmation-hungry audience — and also on the marvelous Ms. Dawson, who plays one of Ben’s victim-beneficiaries — is another matter entirely.  But maybe I’m approaching this in the wrong way. Maybe “Seven Pounds” isn’t a spiritual parable about redemption or forgiveness or salvation or whatever, but rather a collection of practical lessons. Don’t drive while using a BlackBerry. Fertilize your rose bushes with banana peels — sorry, that was a spoiler. But please, whatever you do, don’t touch the jellyfish.  I’m serious. Don’t.  “Seven Pounds” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Swearing. Soulful sex by candlelight. Car  accident. Eggplant parmesan.

A movie that, like �The Sixth Sense,� depends entirely upon the payoff for its impact, �Seven Pounds� is an endlessly sentimental fable about sacrifice and redemption that aims only at the heart at the expense of the head. Intricately constructed so as to infuriate anyone predominantly guided by rationality and intellect, this reteaming of star Will Smith and director Gabriele Muccino after their surprisingly effective �The Pursuit of Happyness� is off-putting for its manifest manipulations, as well as its pretentiousness and self-importance. All the same, the climax will be emotionally devastating for many viewers, perhaps particularly those with serious religious beliefs, meaning there�s a substantial audience out there for this profoundly peculiar drama, if word gets around.
Everything, including the title, the ad campaign and a good portion of the film, is designed to give away absolutely nothing about the true nature of the picture. Melodramatic opening scene plays like something out of an old film noir like �D.O.A.,� as a man (Smith) calls 911 to report a suicide. �Who�s the victim?� the operator asks. �I am,� the man replies, whereupon there�s nowhere to go but to a film-long flashback to reveal what�s gotten him to this point.
Thus begins first-time screenwriter Grant Nieporte�s narrative sleight-of-hand, designed to keep the audience onboard for a long ride while offering just enough of a hint that an intriguing revelation awaits at the end of the line. He�s better at the latter than at the former; for at least the first half of the film, none of what you see makes much sense or possesses any particular dramatic import. 
Carrying an ID card from the U.S. Dept. of Treasury, Smith�s Ben Thomas circles some names on a printout. One is blind phone salesman and pianist Ezra (Woody Harrelson), while another is Emily (Rosario Dawson), a young woman with an enlarged heart who will need a transplant soon if she�s to survive. It�s hard to know how to read Ben during this phase; the way he insinuates himself into other people�s lives gives him something of the air of a hustler or con man, and his contentious phone relationship with his brother (Michael Ealy) raises questions of its own.
On the other hand, Ben appears anxious to please, his directness and soft-spoken urgency betokening a genuineness of intent. Before long, an appealing tenderness enters into his relationship with Emily that ultimately blossoms into a full-blown love story, something that fills out a great chunk of the running time.
Given Emily�s vulnerability, Ben�s gentle patience with her, Smith and Dawson�s attractiveness, the lushly intimate widescreen images devised by Muccino and lenser Philippe Le Sourd, and Angelo Milli�s literally incessant button-pushing score, �Seven Pounds� offers either seductive emotional appeal or indigestible mawkishness, according to taste. Along the way, there are references to a fatal vehicular accident, suggestions of Ben�s deceptiveness and inscrutable imagery of a jellyfish which, you may be sure, all factor crucially in the denouement.
Whether one entirely rejects the project�s high-minded game-playing or falls right into the filmmakers� quasi-spiritual trap and is thereby helplessly reduced to a jellyfish-like state at the end, it�s impossible to claim that Muccino and Nieporte lack the courage of their convictions, or faith in the moral value of their contrived little sacrificial fable. 
Nor can it be said that Smith, whose most recent box office barn-burners, �I Am Legend� and �Hancock,� seemed consciously designed to set the star apart from the rest of humanity, shies away from the saintlike status conferred upon his character. Indeed, he embraces it in a way so convincing that it proves disturbing as an indication of how highly this or any momentarily anointed superstar may regard himself. 


Two years ago nearly to the day, Will Smith and Italian director Gabriele Muccino released The Pursuit of Happyness , one of the most underrated of recent Hollywood movies, which starred Smith as a single father navigating a hand-to-mouth existence on the streets of San Francisco. Writing at the time, I praised the film for Smith's superb performance and for its willingness to honestly address the social and economic realities of America's underclass. Watching Smith and Muccino's latest collaboration, Seven Pounds , I marveled (to paraphrase the great Jermaine Jackson) that something so right could go so wrong.
One key member of the Pursuit  creative team who hasn't returned for the encore is Steve Conrad, the gifted screenwriter whose refreshingly unsentimental script for the earlier film helped to keep things rooted in a street-level grit even in light of plot developments that were straight out of fairy tale. For Seven Pounds , Smith and Muccino are instead working from the first produced screenplay by Grant Nieporte, a TV-sitcom writer whose most significant contribution to popular culture thus far (depending on how you rate his episodes of Sabrina the Teenage Witch  and 8 Simple Rules . . . for Dating My Teenage Daughter ) was as an idea man for the ubiquitous "Tool Time" segments on that early-'90s ratings juggernaut, Home Improvement .
The sitcommer's gift for concocting 22-minute solutions to complex problems is in full evidence in Seven Pounds , a morbid morality play that rivals The Reader  for the bottom spot in this season's celluloid martyrdom derby. The movie begins with Smith framed in coldly lit close-up, phoning 911 from a fleabag Los Angeles motel room to report his own imminent suicide, and for most of the next two hours, Seven Pounds  maintains that anguished, overwrought tenor. Sure, there are requisite flashbacks to cheerier times for Smith's character, Ben Thomas, an IRS tax collector with what at first glance seems an incongruously palatial oceanside home (unless Ben has been picking Uncle Sam's pocket). But even then, a thick funereal mist clouds the air. We know, from quite early on, that Ben is a haunted man, that he once had a beautiful wife and a more glamorous job—cue yet more flashbacks—but that his picture-perfect life came to an abrupt end in one of those tragic incidents that characters in Oscar-baiting, non-linear movies wear on their chests like scarlet letters. Seven Pounds  could have been called The Pursuit of Misery .
What exactly happened to Ben is less significant than what he plans to do about it. So we are subjected to one scene after another of him making house calls on delinquent taxpayers and other unfortunate souls—a blind telemarketer (an uncomfortable-looking Woody Harrelson), a hospital administrator in need of a bone-marrow transplant, a battered housewife in need of an escape from her thuggish husband. These scenes aren't so much encounters as auditions in which Ben, like some creepy Dickensian Christmas spirit, sizes up each candidate and determines whether he or she is a "good" person and, if so, deserving of Ben's charity. Just what he has to give is the "secret" upon which Seven Pounds  pivots—a secret that, if we knew it from the start, would make the movie seem even more preposterous than it already does.
Dispiritingly obvious and phony from top to bottom, Seven Pounds  is the sort of movie in which romance rears its head in the form of an angelic young woman with a literal broken heart (Rosario Dawson, doing her best in a thankless role), and the poisonous jellyfish our hero keeps as a pet is milked for maximum Chekhovian portent. It's also the first time in many films that Smith is less than captivating.
Over the past decade, the former rapper and TV star has matured into one of the most appealing leading men of his generation, graced with a rare ability to invest an elemental human fragility into his portrayals of everymen and supermen alike. Thus Smith would seem a logical choice to star in a movie about the actual ways in which actual people deal with actual grief and loss, and, to some extent, that's exactly what he did last year in I Am Legend . There, for all the CGI accoutrements, the main attraction was Smith himself, giving a bracing, fully dimensional portrayal of a rational man brought low by despair and impotent rage. In Seven Pounds , cast as another widower gripped by life-changing emotions, he's altogether less convincing, in part because the movie is doggedly intent on making the character into a Christ figure, and Smith is so much more compelling as a flawed mortal. Ben Thomas suffers all right, but the audience suffers more.
