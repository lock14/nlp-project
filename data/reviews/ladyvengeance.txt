 No animals were harmed in the making of "Lady Vengeance." This may come as a disappointment to devotees of Park Chanwook, the controversial Korean director of "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" and "Oldboy." Relatively restrained, at least by the hysterical standard of its predecessors, the concluding chapter of Mr. Park's "vengeance trilogy" is a kinder, gentler exercise in empty virtuosity. And it raises a critical new question about this much-discussed filmmaker: Which has grown more tiresome, the debate surrounding his intentions or the movies he makes?  The issue of whether Mr. Park is a serious artist or a solipsistic showoff ought to have been settled by "Cut," his tacky, pretentious, monstrously tedious contribution to the omnibus film "Three Extremes."  But the line still stretches back to "Oldboy," his prizewinning exercise in steroidal pulp fiction.  As you'll recall if you saw it — and who could forget? — one of the first things the hero of that film did after escaping from years of imprisonment was to stop by a sushi joint and sink his teeth into a live, exceedingly distressed octopus. Repellent from an animal-rights perspective but as compelling an image as you'll find in recent movies, the Octopus Scene remains the quintessential Park provocation, the ugly apex of his adolescent oeuvre.  Nothing in the new movie pushes buttons that hard or collapses so many ideas, both daring and dubious, into a single savage image. Always full of hot air, Mr. Park appears to have run out of steam. Like a shark, or Lars von Trier, he needs to keep moving forward, constantly upping his own ante, or he's dead in the water.  His fatigue can be seen in the lazy repetition that gives us another victim of wrongful imprisonment, Geum-ja (Lee Young-ae), newly released and crazed on revenge. In confessing to the murder of a young boy, she took the fall for the real killer, a schoolteacher played by "Oldboy's" Choi Min-sik.  In one of a hundred arbitrary plot details, he forced Geum-ja's hand by kidnapping her daughter. On finishing her prison term, she reclaims the child, who was adopted by a goofy Australian family, and sets to conspiring a nasty death for her nemesis with the help of former cellmates.  Along the way, under the moronic pretext of testing a gun, she blows the head off a puppy. Relax, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, it happens off screen. Relax, People for the Delectation of Extreme Asian Cinema, there is plenty of visible atrocity. Men are tortured, women are raped, and children in snuff videos scream in terror as their anguished parents are forced to watch.  This last bit of business kicks off a Grand Guignol finale that might have expressed an idea instead of an attitude had it any traction in  the real world or exhibited the internal logic of a delirious contrivance like Brian De Palma's "Femme Fatale." This is the gist of Mr. Park's irrelevance as anything but a stylist, and a facile one at that. His puppet people and phony plots are an excuse for rhetorical showboating, neither a source of human value nor the medium of legitimate ethical inquiry.  That's why the story of "Lady Vengeance" is such a convoluted hodge-podge of time frames, subplots and bit player back stories. That's why Geum-ja's ordeal elicits no sympathy. That's why the ending is trite, not transgressive. And that's why Mr. Park's much-lauded formal chops — skewed perspectives, elegant symmetries, swaggering camera work and digitally enhanced edits — just don't cut it.  "Lady Vengeance" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The animals get off easy this time, but the humans are in for all kinds of rape, beating and torture.
By now, for masses of believers in mad Korean pulp as it has been epitomized by Park Chanwook 's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance  and Oldboy , the blood-on-alabaster montage behind the credits of Park's new Lady Vengeance  portends a familiar dynamic. Park's films generally take his movie culture's yen for emotional meth and triple the dose; we know there will be no half measures, no dramatic gasoline unignited, nothing short of horrified respect for the costs of suffering, cruelty, memory, and rage. Ostensibly the capper to Park's "vengeance" trilogya designation that, perhaps dubiously, suggests he'll now begin making films about other things Lady Vengeance  is his most sullen and patient film, and yet it's breathless pop filmmaking, narratively mercurial, viscerally traumatic, and thematically infernal.
Park does run the risk of repeating himself: Here, the template of long-term retribution used by the churlish villain in Oldboy  is handed to the heroine, Geum-ja (Lee Yeong-ae), who after serving 13 years for the killing of a little boy is released from prison. She insists she did it, and in a flashback to her trial, even re-enacts the crime for the police and TV cameras. But, we eventually learn, a grumpy cop (Nam Il-woo) doesn't believe her, and it's clear from her stony demeanor ("You've changed!" everyone says, perturbed) that the woman is ready for the long knives. But we have to wait: Crowding out the crime's details in the film's first jigsaw half are Geum-ja's experiences in prison, where she wins over a score of fellow inmates, donating a kidney to one and poisoning a dyke bully for the sake of another.
Pieced together in overlapping patches covering roughly two decades, the clockwork of Park's story (co-written with first-timer Jeong Seo-gyeong) is often difficult to trace as you watch. But soon enough Geum-ja's frosty post-prison intentions come to light, revealing her preythe kindergarten teacher actually responsible for the murder, played by Oldboy 's unforgettable Choi Min-sik and the methodical scope of her payback plan, which utilizes each of her cultivated jailbird cohorts. As much as Lady Vengeance  spins around its implacable protagonist like a rabid dog on a rope, the film becomes in its last, galling act an unlikely but stunning ensemble piece: Members from several murdered children's families are gathered for a concentrated act of mourning, a debate about responsibility, a protracted execution (in raincoats and by blade, pipe, axe, scissor, and who knows what else), a slice of birthday cake, and a taste of the afterlife.
There's also the matter of Geum-ja's daughter, wrested from her, settled with adoptive Australian parents, and quasi- kidnapped again. Park is less interested this time in submitting us to the chop shop (no tongues are cut, for instance) than having us pick over prairie justice, even collectively enacted, and consider the mechanics of hatred. Even the catalytic murder of the boy is short-shrifted amid the flashbackswe're denied the same primal satisfaction in righteous bloodshed that David Cronenberg  made such farce of in A History of Violence . Killing bad guys for the sake of the American family is like shooting a duck in a political barrel; in Park's realm, violence is a personalized toxifying plume that spreads from perp to victim to survivor and avenging angel.
But perhaps it's political as wellPark has said in interviews that his quandaries of guilt, anger, and conscience were born during his youth under dictatorship, when friends were dragged off and executed while others, like him, stood by. For now, his films come with a blood-rusted badge of validity and burn with regret.
