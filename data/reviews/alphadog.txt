This true-crime yarn beaded with hot, young actors is like watching McG�s Fastlane
 on Xanax. Because it has the Cassavetes label and premiered at last year's Sundance, it flaunts a certain indie cred (also look for Harry Dean Stanton, who seems to have been rented by the day), but this film is way more about tits and ass and drugs and guns and California muscle cars and busting up house parties with kung fu than it is about deep characterization on the epic scale of Scarface
. Cassavetes directs his own script as contemplatively as if he�s channeling his father, John, but with two full hours of wine coolers, absent parents, and threesomes. Though it�s being marketed as a thriller, the use of split screen and intertitles gives the film its only tension. (The scariest thing is actually Stone in a fat suit, in a scene so mind-boggling that we�ll just have to leave it at that: mind-boggling.) During an escalating feud, drug dealer Johnny Truelove (Hirsch) impulsively kidnaps Zack (Yelchin), the relatively innocent teenage brother of  scary tweaker Jake (Foster). Once they�ve grabbed the kid, they can�t let him go, so Johnny stashes him in Palm Springs with Frankie (Timberlake). Sounds okay, right? Wrong. Although there are parties and Zack loses his virginity in a swimming pool, he might not make it back to Claremont alive. It�s a soggy drama said to be inspired by actual events � too serious to be trashy, too trashy to be serious. Cassavetes makes sure we get the idea about the debauched and broken families that yield such trouble by awkwardly providing a documentary crew within the film. To them Willis will deliver the movie�s motto, right into the camera: �This whole thing is about parenting. Taking care of your children.� Gotcha. As for the cast of young and equally billed hopefuls, the biggest knockout is Foster, an intense young actor totally unrecognizable as Eli, the special kid from Freaks and Geeks
. Timberlake is engaging enough but not really stretching it as a smooth talker who might bury your body later, while Hatosy draws the short straw as the humiliated gang novice subjected to homophobic taunts far beyond what the script requires to make its point about masculinity and aggression. (See p.48 in this week's Screens section for an interview with Cassavetes.)



Uh-oh: More scuzzy wannabe gangstas! This time they're in "Alpha Dog," teen pushers from Southern California's San Gabriel Valley who sit around their chi-chi homes stoned, playing video games , and plotting grisly revenge. The obligatory "Scarface" poster adorns one bedroom wall.
Parents are either negligent or overbearing. Kids, meanwhile, have pretty faces and dirty mouths (the movie features some of the least convincing profanity ever used in a movie full of delinquents). They are covered in tattoos and full of bile, racial slurs, and all-purpose anomie that the film doesn't entirely know how to handle.
Written and directed by Nick Cassavetes, "Alpha Dog" spins out from a kidnapping masterminded by a young drug dealer named Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch, a smart actor out of his depths here). One of Johnny's clients, Jake (Ben Foster) , owes him some money. Until the debt is settled, he kidnaps Jake's younger half-brother, Zack (Anton Yelchin). Needless to say, everything goes horribly wrong.
Set in 1999, "Alpha Dog" is ever - so - loosely based on the story of Jesse James Hollywood , a young thug currently awaiting trial. Cassavetes turns him into Johnny and uses the case to start several thoughts he doesn't complete. The director doesn't condone anyone's behavior, but he also makes being abducted seem really cool. There's a fantastic soundtrack, and everyone who sees the kidnapped kid is freeze-framed and assigned a graphic telling us what number witness they are. It plays like a Tony Scott movie, only less amoral.
Johnny's minions are 57 varieties of dumb. The pop star Justin Timberlake plays the smoothest of Johnny's friends. His charisma goes a long way to get him through his less credible emotional moments. Shawn Hatosy plays Elvis, the dimwit, with affecting desperation.
But Foster is the best thing in the movie. For about 40 minutes, he comes at you, at everybody. His character is an elaborately inked Aryan skinhead-junkie from a good Jewish family. (The boy next door, basically.) This guy seems like he fell out of a neo-Nazi production of "Rebel Without a Cause," blazing through every scene with melodramatic brute force. Foster is too much by half, but he's acting in the film I'd rather watch.
"Alpha Dog" promises to be a movie, perhaps the definitive one, about the parent-child breakdown among the privileged. Bruce Willis plays Johnny's criminal dad, David Thornton plays Jake and Zack's father, who has his own addiction demons, and a wildly overindulged Sharon Stone is Zack's overprotective mother. Alex Kingston also has a part as one of several selfishly hedonistic parents. The adults here are in their 40s and early 50s, but one minute they want to be their kids' buddies and the disciplinarian the next. When the older actors share scenes with their younger counterparts, the movie has something disturbing to say.
Cassavetes clearly wants to indict parents who act like children. But like Larry Clark , the director of "Kids" and "Bully," he flirts with doing the same. The son of John Cassavetes and Gena Rowlands , Cassavetes observes his young white teens in their bling-y habitats: essentially in the living rooms of million-dollar homes, high, vulgar, horny, and stupid. But he hangs with them so long that he starts to make it all look stylish.
As it escalates to a nasty conclusion, " Alpha Dog" doesn ' t have the moral or emotional weight of tragedy. These aren't the psychologically exploded youths of "Rebel Without a Cause," or even "The Outsiders." They're characters in a long, violent, unbleeped episode of MTV's "Cribs."


As a career enhancer, Justin Timberlake's recent rendition of ''D--- in a Box'' on SNL  takes the gold. But I'd give his tattooed turn as Frankie, a junior gangsta straight outta L.A.'s comfy San Gabriel Valley, at least the bronze  the guy is that charming in Nick Cassavetes' flashy bad-boy drama Alpha Dog .
Charm, though, is of little value in this noisy semi-True Hollywood Story, about Johnny (Emile Hirsch), a hotheaded drug-dealing daddy's boy who tries to put the heat on a deadbeat associate (Ben Foster, always pleasurably scary) by holding the guy's kid brother, Zack (Anton Yelchin), for ransom. Long story short, the kid  sweet, innocent  has a good time being kidnapped, and surrounded by naughty local babes, while Frankie starts to look on Zack as his own younger brother. Mistake.
Cassavetes (The Notebook ) throws in everything he can recycle to grab a core-demo viewer  slutty teens making out, blaring rock music, guns, split screens. The implication is that too much video culture and too little parental supervision make Johnny a danger  and that it sure is fun to play at being Johnnies in movies. Or even Johnny's parents. Bruce Willis and Harry Dean Stanton pitch in as lowlife adults. And as Zack's histrionically distraught mother, Sharon Stone submits to a fat suit that lends her an unfortunate resemblance to Martin Short's Jiminy Glick.

 “Alpha Dog” is a true-crime story inspired by a pipsqueak thug improbably named Jesse James Hollywood, who once reigned over a modern Sodom and Gomorrah in — you know it — Los Angeles.  In 2000 Mr. Hollywood, a 20-year-old fledgling marijuana kingpin, allegedly ordered the murder of the 15-year-old Nicholas Markowitz, whose half brother owed $1,200 for a dope debt. Friends of this alpha dealer  kidnapped the teenager while he was walking near his San Fernando Valley home. Initially constrained, the hostage was soon getting stoned, drinking and watching television with his captors, who even brought him along to a party. At some point, however, Mr. Hollywood awoke to the severity of the crime (he called his lawyer) and decided to get rid of Nicholas, who was shot multiple times and left to rot in a national forest with sweeping ocean views.  Mr. Hollywood then fled the country and spent years as one of the F.B.I.’s most wanted, before being captured in Brazil in 2005. By then the writer and director Nick Cassavetes was deep into “Alpha Dog,” his sexed-up, alternately funny and horrifying, heavy-panting exploitation of the crime, which, despite some name and geography changes, tracks close to the recorded facts.  Here the dimwitted mastermind is Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch), a pint-size nihilist with wary eyes and a face full of molting hair. He has a skinny blonde named Angela (Olivia Wilde), a pit bull called Adolf and a posse of cretins. He lives in a ranch house big enough for the Bradys and watches a lot of TV. Bruce Willis plays his dad.  The cretins rule in “Alpha Dog,” which has much the same entertainment value you get from watching monkeys fling scat at one another in a zoo or reading the latest issue of Star magazine. Of course a little of that nasty stuff may land on you, but such are the perils of voyeurism. Voyeurism that Mr. Cassavetes, a filmmaker with a lurid imagination and a talent for coaxing full-throttle performances from his actors, rewards with an embarrassment of vulgarities: lusciously tanned flesh, sensuously quivering muscles, cascades of blond hair, acres of tattoos, a sylph in a schoolgirl miniskirt (“Dance, bitch!” someone cries), a three-way in a swimming pool, intimations of Nazism, a little tae kwon do and a lot of homegrown weed.  The kids are not all right. Which is, like, you know, the point. Maybe yes, maybe no, or maybe it’s just fun to watch a lot of attractive, talented young actors shimmy across the screen while embodying the collective parental nightmare. Do you know where your children are? In “Alpha Dog” they’re getting busy, chilling out, smoking blunts and chugging coolers faster than a toothless wino. They’re also baby-sitting a hostage named Zack (Anton Yelchin). They do the darnedest things, these children of the suburban damned: Johnny’s best friend, Frankie (Justin Timberlake), for one, does his chores and culls buds from his father’s pot plants while wearing low-slung shorts and no shirt, his snaky torso soaking up the rays and our gaze under the bright blue sky.  Frankie is as dumb as a bowl of beans, which invests him with an air of harmlessness that grows progressively more frightening as the hostage crisis deepens. Adorned in tattoos, Mr. Timberlake holds the screen effortlessly, delivering a gestural performance that, whether he’s loping across a room or executing a goofy little dance for his buddies, legs rapidly slicing back and forth, reveals as much about Frankie — his need to please, his need to perform — as his lines. Mr. Timberlake’s transformation from pop-culture joke to born-again idol seems more than just smart public relations and a recent well-executed stint on “Saturday Night Live,” and it should earn another boost when and if Richard Kelly’s latest film, “Southland Tales,” is released in theaters.  Ben Foster’s nervy, wonderfully far-out performance as Truelove’s nemesis, Zack’s brother, Jake, is even more notable because it pushes up against the edge of credibility. Like most of the guys and some of the girls in the film, this bullet-headed tough is covered in inky designs, the difference being that he has some Hebrew letters tattooed on his chest and two lightning bolts etched on the back of his neck. Jake looks like the younger brother of the Jewish neo-Nazi Ryan Gosling played in “The Believer,” but despite the Hitler poster and the “Sieg Heil” salute from his girlfriend (a terrific Heather Wahlquist), it’s impossible to know where he’s coming from other than Planet Freak. The film doesn’t say much about him — or anything else, really — but Mr. Foster gives plenty.  Mr. Cassavetes does make some regrettable choices in “Alpha Dog,” notably a news crew that pops up whenever he seems to hit a narrative rough patch. He also puts Sharon Stone in a monstrous fat costume for some flash-forwards, nearly undoing the fine work she does in earlier scenes as the kidnapped boy’s distraught, overprotective mother.  In interviews Mr. Cassavetes has tried to suggest that “Alpha Dog” is about lousy parenting. What rot.  “Alpha Dog” is about the pleasure of watching beautiful bodies at rest and in motion. It’s about the allure of youth, the erotics of violence and the inevitable comeuppance that must always be meted out whenever youth strays too far from the fold and another sad case becomes an evening’s entertainment.  “Alpha Dog” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It features gun violence, under-age drinking, lots of dope smoking, some sexual scenes and female nudity.

Ripped from the headlines and hurled to the screen with more hopped-up energy than insight, "Alpha Dog" is standard-issue tabloid fare pimped out as a serious true-crime saga. Based on the events surrounding longtime fugitive Jesse James Hollywood and a kidnapping that went pointlessly, tragically awry, writer-director Nick Cassavetes' sprawling dramatization recklessly blurs the line between reconstruction and reality in ways that are admittedly interesting, if more than a little artistically suspect. Curiosity in the real-life story, boosted by publicity relating to Cassavetes' own entanglement in the legal proceedings, could draw moderate returns for the New Line release.
One of the youngest men to end up on the FBI's most-wanted list, Hollywood was arrested in March in connection with the August 2000 abduction and murder of San Fernando Valley teenager Nicholas Markowitz. While four others were apprehended and convicted not long after the incident, Hollywood was still at large when pic began production in 2004, and prosecutors, hoping the project would help smoke him out, granted Cassavetes an extraordinary if legally controversial level of access to the case file.
Given these resources, plus the atmosphere of sordid truth-telling that shrouds the whole enterprise like pot smoke, it's odd that "Alpha Dog" (which, after "John Q.," reps Cassavetes' second stab at socially relevant storytelling) doesn't feel more revelatory or honest. Rather, pic's hypothetical re-creation of Markowitz's last days and swingin' depictions of wasted Southern California youth feel as though they've been conceived for a routine studio fiction, while stylistically, the incorporation of mock-documentary footage and occasional use of split-screen come across as flippant rather than illuminating.
Hollywood's stand-in here goes by the similarly iconic name of Johnny Truelove (Emile Hirsch), a young drug dealer who spends most of his time carousing with buddies Frankie (Justin Timberlake), Elvis (Shawn Hatosy) and Tiko (Fernando Vargas) at his pad in the San Gabriel Valley. A round of partying is interrupted one night by volatile junkie Jake Mazursky (Ben Foster), whose refusal to pay back more than $1,000 in drug debts quickly makes him Johnny's No. 1 enemy.
Jake's woes have only furthered his estrangement from fed-up dad Butch (David Thornton) and step mom Olivia (a fierce Sharon Stone), although their 15-year-old son Zack (Anton Yelchin) regards his half-brother with both admiration and envy.
Cassavetes' script carefully engineers the fateful moment of intersection between the gangbanger tensions and the Mazurskys' domestic angst. Fleeing from an argument one morning, Zack runs right into Johnny and his pals, who rough him up and take him prisoner, determined to hold him as collateral until Jake pays up.
Pic suddenly transitions into heightened docudrama mode, keeping track of the date and time and regularly pausing to identify the multiple peripheral characters and bystanders whose real-life counterparts would later come forward as witnesses.
For the most part, however, these affectations suggest a desperate attempt to authenticate an already overcrowded and geographically muddled yarn.
Story's most intriguing element is the bond that develops between Zack and Frankie (played with conviction by Timberlake), who drags the boy to his home in Palm Springs. Cute but corruptible, Zack turns out to be quite happy sampling Frankie's decadent lifestyle, even losing his virginity to two girls in a swimming pool, in a scene that feels like an outtake from "Wild Things."
Robert Fraisse's widescreen lensing smoothly accommodates the many bodies moving through the frame during the party sequences, though it's never clear whether pic is merely observing its characters' debauched lifestyle or exploiting it. Still, these scenes do stay true to the well-documented fact that while several people saw Markowitz during his final hours (some of whom knew he had been kidnapped), the overall party atmosphere was so unthreatening that no one notified the police.
Climax, when it finally arrives, is terrible but unprotracted -- not something that can be said of the subsequent tying up of loose ends.
Cassavetes elicits strong to mixed perfs, with the heavily tattooed Timberlake surprisingly credible as the drama's moral fulcrum and Hirsch adopting a distinct strain of impudent, boyish authority. As Jake, Foster delivers an arrestingly showy vacuum of a performance that ultimately has nothing to resonate against.
Stone's later scenes allow her to go impressively raw and over the top, but her grief following Zack's death, captured in mock-doc style with the actress suddenly wearing a fatsuit, is grotesque, not because the emotions are so intense but because the approach is so pushy. The cast's other big name, Bruce Willis, simply looks bored as Johnny's paunchy pop.

Nick Cassavetes 's Alpha Dog  is based on a real-life story that's still waiting for its ending: In 2000, a gang of SoCal kids kidnapped and murdered 15-year-old Nicholas Markowitz , a soft-spoken boy from the San Fernando Valley  who dreamed of becoming a rabbi and was sacrificed as payment for his older half-brother's drug debta measly $1,200. Four teens were convicted of the murder; the ringleader, a teeny Tony Montana  with the real-life moniker of Jesse James Hollywood , escaped to Brazil, where he was arrested in 2005.
Hollywood now awaits trial, and his attorney has tried to block the release of Alpha Dog , claiming it convicts his client before he's had the chance to prove his innocence. The movie is getting a negligible release as it isa shove into the January dumping ground, where nothing survives for long. It deserves better.
Writer-director Cassavetes, who prepped for the movie by poring over off-limits files leaked by the case's prosecutor, smartly stages much of his tragedy as though it were a comedy of errorsthe plans of dumbass punks gone awry. Hollywood, here named Johnny Truelove  (Emile Hirsch ), is, after all, not a great criminal mastermind, but merely a baby-faced punk who deals weed to spoiled Valley girls and their hip-hopped-up boyfriends. Truelove's posse, as threatening as any hallway gang at your average prep school, includes Elvis Schmidt  (Shawn Hatosy ), a subservient clown who suffers Johnny's abuse and Frankie Ballenbacher  (Justin Timberlake ), a swaggering sidekick clad in tank tops to display his tats. No way they could kill a kid (here named Zack and played by Anton Yelchin ), not these wake-and-bakers.
( Alpha Dog  isn't simply about boys and girls gone wildthat's Larry Clark 's milieu, and even he's worn it sheerbut also about the parents who allow it to happen because they're either doped-up imbeciles wearing plasticine grins, absentee assholes waving the occasional iron fist, or both.)
Cassavetes, cut loose after tethering himself to the old-fashioned, ham-handed romance of The Notebook , digs his new role as New Journalist, laying out a horrific tale of suburban indulgence gone wrong. He's so into the movie he put himself in the movie: That's his voice you hear on the soundtrack, interviewing folks about their roles in Johnny's life and Zack's death. Cassavetes gets overly enthusiastic with the docudrama form at timeslots of split-screen, in an attempt to make Alpha Dog  play like some seedy '70s crime dramabut I'm tempted to forgive his excesses because the guy knows tension. How better to ram home the horrific consequences than by building up the boys' actions as little more than rough-and-tumble fun?
And, if nothing else, Alpha Dog 's worth a look for the performance of Justin Timberlake, the moral center of a movie sorely in need of some conscience. Already a gifted comic actorhis Saturday Night Live   appearances are now anticipated eventshe proves himself able to go to a pitch-black place. Frankie, covered in tats, is less a gangsta with a heart of gold than a nice guy capable of doing some very bad shitlike every last one of the rabid pups in Alpha Dog .
