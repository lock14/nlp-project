It is to be feared that The Seeker
, which is adapted from British author Susan Cooper's five-volume series of children's fantasy novels, is but the opening cinematic salvo in what can charitably be described as the best way to get your kids to crack open Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur
 and Frazer's The Golden Bough
 before they opt for the CliffsNotes versions once they hit university. Cooper herself has acknowledged a debt to both of those classics of man's most abiding literary mythos, and her books may, indeed, be ripping good, young-adult yarns. As scripted by, of all people, Trainspotting
's John Hodge and helmed with all the subtlety of a morning star to the corpus maxillae
, this is a fantasy film utterly devoid of all but the most bombastically simplistic notions of what true
 fantasy can ignite within the imaginations of both young and somewhat-less young. Throughout its interminable and steadfastly, maniacally bewildering running time, neither the cast nor director Cunningham appear to have even the most rudimentary idea of what is going on from one sequence to the next. Adolescent Yank expat Will Stanton (Ludwig, who should immediately seek out the nearest Child Protective Services office to ensure that this sort of horrific r�sum�-killer never blackens his future again) is living with his scholarly parents (Hickey, Crewson) when one Merriman Lyon (McShane, clearly in need of a scotch and water or less gravitas by any means necessary) arrives and promptly names poor Will the Seeker of the title. Lyon is a self-styled "immortal," and he turns up with a coterie of like-minded magical eccentrics who demand that Will, the prophesied warrior of the Light, posthaste gird his puberty-stricken loins for the imminent apocalyptic battle with the Dark. And who better to essay the role of the Darkness incarnate than this season's Doctor Who, aka Christopher Eccleston � heck, he's already a Time Lord, so why not? None of this made a lick of sense to me, nor did it appear to be all that obvious to either the cast or screenwriter Hodge, whose work here feels as though he'd given up in frustration halfway through before deciding to see how far he could push the vaguely Harry Potter
-esque shenanigans before getting sacked. Lesson learned: Seek not, lest you find Doctor Who is, in point of fact, a total rotter.


"The Dark Is Rising" is one of the lesser-known fantasy-novel series for younger readers. Written by Susan Cooper from 1965 through 1977, the five books don't have the cultural cachet or the readership of, say, "The Lord of the Rings," "The Chronicles of Narnia," "A Wrinkle in Time," or "Harry Potter." That just makes Cooper's fans more impassioned, though; one of my co-workers calls the books "only the most formative series of my childhood years."
With this in mind, I suggest the makers of "The Seeker" enter a witness-protection program posthaste. As literary muggings go, the film isn't up there with "The Bonfire of the Vanities," but it's thorough and dispiriting and certain to enrage the only people who stand to care about it. The producers - Fox Films and the usually reliable Walden Media - have tried to gin up the story for multiplex audiences. They've succeeded in making a movie for no audience at all.
No need to go into line-item offenses against the book, which you probably haven't read anyway. "The Seeker," based on the Newbery Medal-winning second in Cooper's series, tells the tale of Will Stanton (the pallid Alexander Ludwig), a 13-year-old American living with his family in rural England. Will discovers he's the long-awaited savior in the endless battle between The Dark and The Light, gifted with superpowers and charged by the Old Ones to find the six signs - they look like collectible buttons - that will turn back the forces of evil forever.
In practical terms, this means a scavenger hunt across historical epochs: Will gets a funny feeling and, poof, he's in the middle of a Viking battle and the sign is hidden in a berserker's shield. Directed by David L. Cunningham and written by John Hodge ("Trainspotting"), "The Seeker" hustles us from one frenetically-shot sequence to the next without pausing for breath; it feels like a highlight reel for a film we never get to see.
On Will's side are a local Grande Dame (Frances Conroy) and her butler (Ian McShane), two of the Old Ones; against him is a metrosexual meanie called The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), sort of a He Who Can Be Named. In general, Cooper's story line has been Potterized to little avail: Will's family is as large as the Weasleys, as unloving as the Dursleys, and no fun whatsoever.
"The Seeker" doesn't have the expansiveness or the special-effects budget to work as a decent one-shot fantasy film, either. Choppy editing and Ritalin camerawork create confusion rather than excitement, and any larger message gets fumbled in the crush. What exactly are The Light and The Dark? The filmmakers sincerely hope you don't ask.


         If there's a lesson to be learned from the fantasy adventure "The Seeker," it's that when Ian McShane tells you not to do something, you really should listen.
 
 In this dreary, spectacle-driven adaptation of "The Dark Is Rising," the second novel in Susan Cooper's award-winning fantasy series for young adults, the stentorian-voiced English actor, late of "Deadwood" fame, plays Merriman Lyon. As one of the Old Ones, a quartet of immortal warriors, Merriman tutors young Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig) in the ways of the Light and the Dark and lays out the tremendously important task that is his destiny. Will learns everything the hard way, usually by disregarding Merriman's advice.
 


         






   John Hodge's script diverges fairly significantly from Cooper's book, most notably in changing Will from an 11-year-old English boy to a slightly older American whose family has recently relocated to a small town in the United Kingdom. The seventh son of a seventh son (with all the baggage that the numerology apparently implies), Will awakens on his 14th birthday and discovers he has heightened senses that can turn a visit to a mall into something resembling a bad drug trip.
 
 He soon learns from Merriman and the other Old Ones, who include Frances Conroy as Miss Greythorne, that he is one of them, the last in a line of warriors empowered to save the world from the evil forces of the Dark. Will's role as the Seeker is to find the six signs, small circles marked with crosses, each one made from a different material, before the Dark's envoy, the Rider (Christopher Eccleston), can acquire them.
 
 Time is of the essence, as the Rider's powers increase over the five days in which Will has to find the signs, presaged by increasingly bad weather -- even by English standards. The signs are hidden throughout history but, fortunately, one of Will's powers is the ability to step through different epochs and return just as quickly.
 
 Like many a fantasy protagonist, Will has powers that coincide with the onset of puberty and manifest  in ways such as the huge explosions of fire that erupt as he experiences frustration over his lack of success with an older girl (Amelia Warner) who captures his fancy. The character's age and supernatural abilities invite unflattering comparisons to the "Harry Potter" films, which do a much better job of making this type of myth-driven story compelling.
 
 There are hints that this might have once been a more character-driven project, as the first part takes its time in introducing Will's situation and his large family before launching into a hectically paced middle and end. Rather than giving the film a sense of urgency, the chaos dilutes the story's English folklore roots, making it feel more generic.
 
 What made it to the screen is stripped down to its action essentials, skipping ahead from one effects-laden clash to the next. It feels as if entire reels have been dropped. Director David L. Cunningham (TV's "The Path to 9/11") applies a jarring, disorienting style to much of the action that, rather than mirroring Will's inner confusion, distances the audience from his plight.
 

 
 "The Seeker." MPAA rating: PG for fantasy action and some scary images. Running time: 1 hour, 39 minutes. In general release.   

 The forces of Light and Dark are at it again in “The Seeker,” David L. Cunningham’s stilted fantasy about a pubescent lad charged with defeating evil and earning millions of dollars for an American movie studio. Let’s all try to recall where we’ve heard that before.  On the eve of his 14th birthday, everything changes for Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig), an American living in Britain with his extremely large family. (Naturally, Will is the seventh son of a seventh son, so the old-woman-who-lived-in-a-shoe vibe is essential, if distracting.) When darkening skies and a masked horseman (Christopher Eccleston) get between Will and his  crush (Amelia Warner), he is dismayed to learn that he is really a warrior who must find six signs and release the Light. From where is anybody’s guess.  Feebly assisted by a bunch of dodderers known appropriately as the Old Ones, Will braves a Viking war and 1,000 slithering snakes. Yet despite the creepiness of a scene featuring a pair of morphing mall security guards, John Hodge’s screenplay is frequently dreary and overly literal. Will’s Googling of “the light and the dark” is only the most risible example.  Based on “The Dark Is Rising” series of books by Susan Cooper (who has claimed “enormous” differences between her work and the screenplay), “The Seeker” feels passé and lacks a charismatic lead. Too bad Daniel Radcliffe is an only child.  “The Seeker” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has rabid ravens, writhing pythons and lots and lots of floodwater.

"The Seeker" places the world's fate where fantasy adventures so often do -- in the hands of an American boy who is "chosen," but must learn to believe in himself. Slick, good-looking, cluttered pic won't please fans of novelist Susan Cooper's original "The Dark Is Rising" sequence. But then, they are mostly grown-ups by now, and this very Hollywood-style adaptation of a very English book is aimed squarely at tweens. Release amid fall doldrums, away from competing fantasy pics, could help the starless, low-brand-recognition effort reach decent B.O. numbers, with ancillary biz boosting sequel prospects.
Cooper wrote the series' official first installment, "Over Sea, Under Stone," in the mid-'60s. But that was a stand-alone tale, written in a plainer style than the four books that followed, starting with 1973's "The Dark Is Rising" itself (pic's title has been changed to "The Seeker"). First of many liberties taken by John Hodge's screenplay -- and most likely to gall purists -- is that protag is no longer a mild-mannered English 11-year-old. Now he's a Yank transplant of 14 who gets crushes on girls, and doesn't take long to accept he's special, a la Luke Skywalker or Harry Potter.
Specifically, Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig), whose dad has just relocated the family to an ultra-quaint Brit shire, learns that he is the final warrior in the battle between Light and Dark. This bit of news is sprung on his birthday, amid various strange occurrences including ominous raven flocks and a creepsome interrogation by shopping mall security guards. Accosted by a scary pursuing horseman known as the Rider (Christopher Eccleston), Will is saved by four of the English hamlet's elder citizens, Miss Greythorne (Frances Conroy), Merriman (Ian McShane), Dawson (James Cosmo) and George (Jim Piddock).
They announce they are among the Old Ones, ancient guardians of the Light, and Will must realize his destiny as an Old One, too. His skepticism is soon assuaged by the discovery of telepathic, telekinetic and other powers.
Alas, his coming of age also means the Rider and his confederates in the Dark will try any means to stop Will from acquiring six signs, by which he can prevent global apocalypse or something of the like. To summarize: Dark bad. Light good.
Cooper presented this rather basic good/evil mythos in more low-key, atmospheric form than the film allows, leaving thesps (particularly McShane) having to poker-face their way through lines like, "The future of the human race rests on you!" Cued in the conventional current mode toward escalating, overblown, nearly nonstop action and fantasy f/x, pic ends up bearing little resemblance to the book.Which is not to say it doesn't work on its own terms, as a colorful juvenile adventure whose cliches and silliness will be acceptable to younger viewers because they're typical of the genre. "Seeker" would work better overall, however, if its first couple reels took their time building mood, rather than jumping straight into rushed narrative and editing rhythms.
Director David L. Cunningham (of last year's controversial ABC mini "The Path to 9/11") does a polished, workmanlike job, assembling a package attractive in its visual elements. David Lee's production design and Joel Ransom's lensing are quite handsome, even if the latter goes a bit overboard with distortive lensing, tilty camera angling and slow-mo. CGI and other effects are well handled; Christophe Beck's score reps a pro retread of familiar orchestral terrain.
Ludwig has a struggle holding the film together, though, as with Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker in the recent "Star Wars" chapters, neither material nor execution makes his thesping task enviable. Other juve turns are OK; vet actors turn in acceptable paycheck-cashing perfs, though letting them demonstrate more humor a la the "Harry Potter" pics wouldn't have hurt. Romania stands in ably for the English countryside.
