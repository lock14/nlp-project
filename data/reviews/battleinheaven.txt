         For "Battle in Heaven," as he did with his acclaimed debut feature "Japón," boldly idiosyncratic Mexican filmmaker Carlos Reygadas asks audiences to plunge headlong into his chaotic vision of the world, no questions asked but complete trust required. Not everyone is going to be willing or able to take this leap of faith, but those who do go along with Reygadas may well feel they have come away having undergone a stunning revelatory experience.
 
  "Battle in Heaven" opens with a scene of graphic sex between a beautiful young woman, Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz), and Marcos (Marcos Hernández), a swarthy middle-aged man with a substantial potbelly. Eschewing exposition and backing into his story in elliptical, fragmented fashion, Reygadas gradually reveals that for 15 years Marcos has worked as a chauffeur for Ana's father, a general in charge of the elaborate daily military ceremony of raising and lowering an immense Mexican flag at the Zócalo, the central square of Mexico City and symbolic heart of the country. Marcos has been Ana's chauffeur since her childhood, and she has entrusted him with the secret of her double life. In an apparent act of defiance of her wealthy family, Ana has become a prostitute, a profession she pursues with considerable enthusiasm.
 


         






    Marcos in turn has decided to entrust Ana with a terrible secret. Under the implicit dominating influence of his wife (Bertha Ruiz), a singularly homely woman of much girth, he has joined her in a foolish, despicable scheme to make some quick money that has gone disastrously awry. Marcos is so wracked with guilt that to cheer him up Ana takes him to the upscale brothel where she works and sets him up with a fellow prostitute. But ultimately he declares he wants to be only with Ana.
 
  This potentially most melodramatic of situations becomes for Reygadas a point of departure to evoke life in contemporary Mexico City, which half a century ago was a beautiful, gracious metropolis of only about a million people that has exploded into a megalopolis with a population of 20 million overlaid with a complex grid of freeways. Many of the scenes in the film could just as easily have been shot in Los Angeles. At every turn, Reygadas evokes the impersonal, dehumanizing quality of modern urban life.
 
  Ana at first is taken aback by Marcos' request but acquiesces out of compassion, with a probable mixture of curiosity and daring. They unleash in each other, however, an unexpected passion, which deepens Marcos' guilt and conflict, with Ana quietly telling Marcos that he must turn himself into the police, which is the last thing his wife, who loves him with a possessive intensity, wants him to do. Not surprisingly, Marcos finds himself spiraling further out of control and craving redemption ever more deeply.
 
  There is much that is bravura in Reygadas' style, including a 360-degree pan from Ana and Marcos lying side by side on the bed in her airy, chic apartment to outside her window wall and back to the couple. Worthy of Antonioni, this shot has the effect of establishing their place — their connection to each other — in the universe, even if it is only momentary. "Battle in Heaven" is a romantic tragedy, in which Marcos assumes Ana has fallen in love with him as deeply as he has with her. Beyond this Reygadas reveals what is so depressingly universal about today's Mexico City only to peel it away and discover what is eternal and distinctly Mexican: the proud, pompous flag ceremony and, more important, the unchanging transcendent power and significance of the Virgin of Guadalupe. With such groundbreaking films as "Amores Perros" and "Y tu Mamá También" and these of Carlos Reygadas, it's pretty clear that the renaissance of the Mexican cinema is for real.

Battle in Heaven  begins and ends with graphic scenes of a Mexican flag slowly being raised and lowered by a military honor guard. Oh, and also of oral sex, performed on a fat, naked, inexpressive middle-aged Mexican man by a lithe, naked, inexpressive young woman whose blondish dreadlocked hair, piercings, tattoos, and eyeliner suggest the stylings of a rich punk princess.
Between those two attention grabbers on a theme of flagpoles, languorously performed and indifferently observed, Mexican filmmaker/provocateur Carlos Reygadas pitches his own fight for the aesthetic tolerances of viewers, goading us to react to images about which he himself studiously offers no opinion. The fat man, Marcos (Marcos Hernández, like the rest of the cast a nonprofessional actor chosen for his physical appearance), is a chauffeur for the general who supervises the daily flag operation. The girl on her knees is Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz), the general's daughter. Both are engaged in sideline operations: She slums in a brothel, while he and his wife (Bertha Ruiz) have gotten in on the craze for infant kidnap and ransom, with tragic results.
Perhaps the pairings of Marcos and Ana, of sex and military display, of botched crimes and bad skin, are meant to signify modern Mexico; Reygadas won't say. Indeed, as in his splashy debut feature, 2003's Japón , every scene is an uninflected event, presented without what the filmmaker would surely call the ''crutch'' of narrative  and what this critic would call the dignity of conviction. The coupling of Marcos and his homely wife is treated with no more or less weight  or privacy  than a noisy parade of Catholic pilgrims through the streets of Mexico City, which Marcos eventually joins in a gesture of what may be spiritual longing; who knows, since that despair, too, is undercut by the coldness with which Reygadas observes his countrymen.
A notorious opinion divider last year at Cannes, Battle in Heaven  is less about heaven or battle, or hell on earth, or the soul of Mexico, and all too much about gawking. And so, for all the ''shock'' of the movie's clinical carnality, this battle is lost.

 At once unmoored and ruthlessly calculating, the Mexican film "Battle in Heaven" has everything for everyone — or perhaps nothing at all. Among the attractions are sex, class, God, soccer, an ugly man, a beautiful woman, a dead baby, the dirt below them and the wide sky above. The film was written and directed by Carlos Reygadas, who after making a sensational feature debut four years ago with "Japón" has returned with a strangely mesmerizing and off-putting follow-up that finds him at the crossroads between inspiration and risky self-parody.  Above all else, Mr. Reygadas has a superb eye. As often as not in "Battle in Heaven" that eye is turned toward the mundane and, as during several of the film's explicit sex scenes (more on those later), the repellent; there are any number of times when it would be easier, certainly more pleasant, to look at the ceiling, the floor, anywhere but the screen. But while Mr. Reygadas is interested neither in our comfort nor easy entertainment, he clearly does not want to relinquish his hold on us. Working again with Diego Martínez Vignatti, the cinematographer for "Japón," the director doesn't just seize our attention; he commands it — forcing us into a world of terror and beauty.  There is a little of both in the film's opening image of a sweating, corpulent man being sexually serviced by a young woman in an otherwise empty room. The man, Marcos (Marcos Hernández), works in Mexico City as a chauffeur for the woman's father, a general; her name is Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz). Crowned by a tangle of dreadlocks, a ring piercing her lower lip, Ana works as a prostitute, either for kicks or because whores and whoring always interest male directors. Whatever the case, she proves generous to a fault when it comes to her body, giving herself freely, even insistently to this man without explanation or excitement. What Marcos makes of her benevolence is initially as much of a puzzle as almost everything else in the film.  In short order we also learn that Marcos's lumpier unnamed wife (Bertha Ruiz), a woman of Botero proportions if not grace, has accidentally killed an infant the couple had kidnapped for ransom. The murder is presented without evident sentiment; the wife simply says the baby let out a small scream. As he receives this grim news, standing alongside his wife in the subway passageway where they sell clocks and sweets, Marcos's face remains blank even as Mr. Reygadas's camera assumes his point of view, showing us what he sees, beginning — pointedly — with a small child. Again and again, the camera will either stand at a remove from Marcos, watching him as if he were a bug, or present the world as he sees it: as a blur, as a mystery.  Mr. Reygadas's seemingly free-floating images — the massively waving flag, the ponderously  writhing bodies and, somewhat later in the film, the pooling blood — represent not just an attempt to get inside another consciousness, but also into a collective being. Like the soldiers who raise the flag, the religious pilgrims crowding the streets and the soccer fans filling a stadium, Marcos appears simultaneously adrift and captive to rituals drained of meaning. Both a pitiful symbol of modern Mexico and a lump of very human flesh, he stares blankly at a world that offers nothing in return. That might make the film unforgivably bleak if not for the director's ability to turn moments of private, ordinary alienation — the stuff that makes us think we are terminally alone — into shared experience, into cinema.  There isn't much of a story in "Battle in Heaven," just actions, gestures, faces, bodies and snatches of dialogue, some of it banal, some of it unbelievable. The nonprofessional actors sit, stand and repose in the frame awkwardly, as if arranged like obedient children, like furniture, and recite most of the dialogue without the cascading rhythms of real speech, sometimes pausing before delivering a line. Mr. Reygadas has, rather hopefully, sought to explain this performance style by invoking Robert Bresson. The French director used nonprofessional actors, whom he called "models," to deliver nominally affectless, naturalistic performances that depend as much on our interest in other human beings as on the filmmaker's art and world view. Mr. Reygadas's admiration for Bresson is understandable if nowhere evident onscreen.  Namedropping a patron saint of the art like Bresson has its uses, though perhaps Mr. Reygadas actually believes himself so inspired. One crucial difference between the filmmakers is their commitment to their material and the world. Whatever your feelings about Bresson, whether you are pulled into his work or put off, there can be no doubt that what happens onscreen comes from an engaged, penetrating consciousness. Mr. Reygadas's commitment in "Battle in Heaven," by contrast, can feel self-interested. There is a searching quality to his camerawork, but too often he seems to be searching for a meaning (not the meaning),  almost as if he needed to justify his artistry. That helps explain why the sex in the film comes across as more exploitative than not, and also why he throws in a graphic spasm of violence.  This needless, late-act bloodletting is particularly unfortunate because it distracts us from the equally devastating violence that comes before: not only the unseen murder of an infant, but also the soul-killing emptiness of Marcos's existence. Perhaps this is where Bresson comes in. Mr. Reygadas clearly wants to say something about his country, to tap into the spiritual and material desperation of its people, but he never finds a way into Marcos that makes you feel the filmmaker's genuine interest. And he stumbles badly by thinking that a shocking murder can tell us more about how we live and die than a man and woman trying to sell cheap goods to uninterested passers-by. At its finest, "Battle in Heaven" presents life as a series of struggles — it shows us the battle is right here.
Just when you thought there might be little or nothing new under the projector-beam sun, Carlos Reygadas 's Battle in Heaven  ker-blams into town, discombobulating the small thinkers and smiting the wicked. It's a movie and a half, teeming with insidious visual ideas and a fearless moral equilibriumwhich, on the face of it, could easily be mistaken for outrageous exploitation. The Mexican counterpart, in a sense, to both Catherine Breillat  and Tsai Ming-liang, Reygadas is his industry's under-40 fire-starter, and his debut, Japón  (2002), however demanding and scandalizing, may've been only a foretaste of what's to come. Battle in Heaven , as ambitious as its title, is a living mystery, already notorious for hardcore-osity but so serious about its formal intelligence and so deep-dish in its evocations of inexpressible desolation, personal and social, that it occupies your skull like a siege of Huns.
The first, abstractly shot blowjob is, we discover later, a daydream of sorts, and the girl's tears, suggesting a drama of exploitation ahead, prove to be irrelevant. The fat dick belongs to Marcos (Marcos Hernández ), a middle-aged, potbellied driver for a military general in Mexico City; the mouth belongs to Ana (Anapola Mushkadiz, a 19-year-old Phoebe Cates  type with dreads), the unseen general's independent demi-whore daughter. John Tavener 's cosmically aching score presages the slow drip of clues: Marcos gets a cell call on the job. A baby has died, but whose? Marcos meets his obese wife (Bertha Ruiz ) in the subway corridor where she sells clocks and jelly on a blanket; they barely talk, watching the passersby and rifle-bearing soldiers. But something has gone terribly wrong. In fact, a crime the particulars of which we can only surmise begins at this moment to poison the film, and Marcos.
Reygadas has said that narrative is merely a market-required pretext for making a film, and his challenging method for invoking inner states is as elusive as the story. From the first sequence (when the camera somehow moves into a frontal close-up of Ana in mid-suck), Battle in Heaven  is a tango of unstable perspectives. Time and again, a single shot begins as a character's point of view (like Marcos's, looking through the windshield), and then imperceptibly transforms into something else altogether. The soundtrack ebbs and flows as well, and the net effect is a profound but almost philosophical sense of unease, not programmed for our visceral participation but as guidance at a remove.
To us Marcos is virtually a somnambulist, but even the narcissistic Ana notices that his tectonic plates have shifted out of place. Their eventual coitus, authentic and rueful (all of the actors are non-pro), may be the film's semi-disclosing coup de grace: In a maestro camera move that backslaps Hitchcock and De Palma, Reygadas pan-dollies away from the rutting couple and out the window 360 degrees, picking up conversations in the surrounding neighborhood before returning to their prone forms, their issues unresolved. Even then, the filmmaker is aware of our movie reflexes, supplementing an unexpected holding of hands with the suspense of watching Hernández's cock slowly droop from its erection.
The boiling magma of the movieMarcos's internal guilt-rotremains withheld, but its breathtaking tension builds from our dawning awareness, and from the catatonic opera of sex-escape and cultural-redemption hunger whipped up around Marcos's dilemma. Signs and wonders multiply; we watch a tree as its noisy flock of birds converses with another farther away, and then, ominously, falls silent. The film's relationship with a national state of the soul is tangential but cruciallike Caché 'swhile Mexico's surreal approach to Christian iconography is seen freshly, down to the climactic set piece shot amid an actual pilgrimage of thousands at the Basilica of Guadalupe. Promiscuously inhabiting several planes at once, Reygadas's restless inquisition may already be this year's movie to beat.
