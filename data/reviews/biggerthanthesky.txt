Bigger Than the Sky
 tells us in no uncertain terms that theatre people are a breed apart: half-human, half-wood-nymph-and-satyr assemblages constructed primarily out of unchecked emotion, madmen and lovers to the last. As a stereotype, it�s not so far off � Shakespeare in Love
 for the Red, White, and Blaine
 set � but Bigger Than the Sky
 feels constrained by its unshakable predisposition toward actorly fawning. This film is so enamored of theatre folk and their lusty lot that you want to slap it about the face and neck and force it to go endure the inevitable hip-hop take on Beckett�s existential yawn � Waiting for Good Dough
 � just to watch it run shrieking to James Lipton to beg for clemency. The film adopts a dullard�s view of the proscenium arch as a comically romantic chapel for the social misfit and perpetual personal growth machine. Marcus Thomas plays Peter Rooker, a pathetically antisocial sad sack with, as he puts it, �a dull job and a dull life.� So lacking in interest is his lot, in fact, that his girlfriend has just left him in the lurch and presumably wandered off seeking a more intellectually invigorating romance with a starfish or possibly a bit of gravel. Thanks to some magical realism that wafts through Bigger Than the Sky
 whenever the script can�t find a better way to induce character action, Peter soon finds himself enrolling in the Portland Community Theater�s local production of Rostand�s Cyrano de Bergerac
. Personal growth, you see. Surrounded by the dregs of Portland�s stagehounds � including Northern Exposure
�s Corbett as a theatre lifer Michael and Smart�s nymphy, nervy Grace � Peter does indeed blossom, but his acting chops, for the most part, consist of line readings so wooden you could build a coffin out of them, plus a hangdog expression that suggests a recent beating at the paws of a schnauzer. There are some bright spots in this woefully earnest production, the most bizarre of which is a sequence involving a pompous and bloated theatre critic prone to elfin-tweezed eyebrows and sonorously catty pronouncements � Rex Reed as realized by William Conrad � but for the most part Bigger Than the Sky
 is awash in the obvious and sports a patently predictable outcome. Somewhere, Stanislavsky is shrieking as well.

         In "Imaginary Heroes," writer-director Dan Harris covers a year in the life of a family in the aftermath of their older son's suicide, which has left his mother, Sandy (Sigourney Weaver), and especially his father, Ben (Jeff Daniels), devastated in credible but radically different ways. The focal point of the film, however, is the younger son, Tim (Emile Hirsch), for whom the tragedy triggers a rocky but illuminating coming of age.
 
  It would have been nice if Harris, who casts a sardonic yet compassionate eye on the Travis family, had set his sights a little higher than the typical chronicle of a dysfunctional suburban family. He knows how to create complex, believable characters and how to inspire his talented actors to superior performances — Weaver in fact is at her edgy, forthright best — and Harris has a sure sense of structure that reveals itself in his ability to pull off a series of adroitly placed surprises.
 


         






    To Harris' credit, nothing about the key people is the least bit glib. Indeed, they and their issues are at times excruciatingly real. Yet it would have been a stronger film had Harris cast a fresher, more revealing eye on the privileged world in which they live.

  On the rebound in a new stage of life
 
 
A flimsy comedy thoroughly intoxicated with the magic of theater, "Bigger Than the Sky" stars Marcus Thomas as a dullard of a graphic designer who tries to live a little by joining a Portland, Ore., community theater production of "Cyrano de Bergerac." Painfully well-intentioned, the film is undone by a lead character who undermines any goodwill earned by the performances of John Corbett, Amy Smart, Clare Higgins, Allan Corduner, Patty Duke and Sean Astin.
 
  Peter Rooker (Thomas), a mopey young man having trouble bouncing back from being dumped by his bored girlfriend, decides to audition on a whim and implausibly lands the lead. Thomas plays the part with such wincing sincerity that it's hard to imagine anyone casting him as anything other than tech support. Peter is supposed to be an awful actor, but every aspect of the character is rendered so on-the-nose — excuse the pun — as to strain credibility.
 
  This heartfelt valentine to the stage, written by Rodney Vaccaro and directed by Al Corley (who starred in TV's "Dynasty"), leaves no cliché unturned. If it has anything to recommend, it is the loving portrayal of the camaraderie of those who participate in art for art's sake who, to quote Cyrano, "work without one thought of gain or fame."
 
 "Bigger Than the Sky," 
rated PG-13 for some language and sexual references. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes. At Loews Cineplex Beverly Center 13, 8522 Beverly Blvd., (310) 652-7760; and Laemmle's Town Center 5, 17200 Ventura Blvd., Encino, (818) 981-9811.
 
 
   

ook at me -  I'm just dull," Peter Rooker (Marcus Thomas) tells his sister at the beginning of this self-conscious comic drama. And he is. He has a boring art-department job at some unspecified company, and his girlfriend has just left him. His life is bleak, as Al Corley, a first-time film director, heavy-handedly demonstrates by showing Peter cooking for himself and watching television in the dark. But Peter is going to be saved. On his way to the office, he sees a casting notice for a community-theater production of "Cyrano." Although he has no acting experience, he auditions. He is very, very bad, and "Bigger Than the Sky" establishes its low credibility by having the play's director, Edwina Winters (Clare Higgins), so taken with his supposed realness that she casts him. In the title role. This is idiotic because she has talented, experienced company regulars like Michael Degan (the talented, experienced John Corbett) available. But Peter accepts the role and soon has a life that revolves around evening rehearsals and late-night drinking with his new friends. He is attracted to his co-star, Grace Hargrove (Amy Smart), who is playing Roxanne, but Grace and Michael have something going on, which complicates matters. Peter also meets the company's beloved former director, Kippy Newberg (the excellent Allan Corduner), whose counsel is to "play true to the end." "Cyrano" takes over Peter's life, and he finds himself arriving late for work and falling asleep at meetings. In a rash moment, he quits his job, only to drop by the theater and discover Edwina secretly working with another actor, the egotistical Ken Zorbell (Sean Astin), because she has lost faith in Peter. Mr. Astin is playing against "Lord of the Rings" type (he was the lovable, loyal Sam) and participating in a bit of stunt casting. Patty Duke, his mother, plays a dowdy theater-company employee and that woman's identical twin, a chain-smoking wardrobe mistress. Yes, Patty Duke as twins. The surprising thing about "Bigger Than the Sky" is its touching ending. A colleague has died, and the company gathers to honor him in an inventive, life-affirming way. Finally it becomes clear that Mr. Corley's film is meant to be a tribute to the love of theater. It has just been posing as the story of one man's finding himself. "Bigger Than the Sky" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has profanity and discreet sexual situations.

In an unintended way, this peculiar ode to community theater does make one yearn to attend such a production -- if only as an alternative to watching the film. "Bigger Than the Sky" establishes a melancholy tone, but doesn't connect either in concept -- a sad-sack who staggers into a production of "Cyrano de Bergerac" -- or execution. In theater, we're told, "normal rules do not apply," but some invariably do, and this unconvincing poser will soon be chased off the stage.
Rodney Vaccaro's screenplay seizes upon a familiar theme -- an Everyman whose life is shaken up by immersion in a crazy new world. Still, in the hands of former "Dynasty" actor Al Corley, making his directing debut, the result proves so awkward and improbable as to leave none of the fuzzy afterglow that was clearly intended.
A key problem involves Marcus Thomas, who is either playing his dullard of a character Peter Rooker badly or a bit too well -- to the point where a casual viewer might envision Rooker being cast as Lenny in "Of Mice and Men," but surely not the swashbuckling Cyrano.
Dumped by his girlfriend and bored with his go-nowhere job, Peter somewhat impulsively tries out for Edmond Rostand's classic play at his friendly neighborhood theater in Oregon. Despite his dismal audition, the slightly avant-garde director, Edwina (Clare Higgins) -- whose commitment to the story's "inner truth" includes shearing the title character's celebrated snout -- decides to cast Peter in the lead.
Overwhelmed at first, Peter slowly begins taking to these wacky theater folk, from Michael, the eccentric playing Christian (John Corbett); to Grace (Amy Smart), the free-spirited beauty cast as Roxanne; to the company's dying patriarch, Kippy (Allan Corduner). With Michael and Grace, Peter forms what's not quite delineated enough to qualify as a love triangle -- maybe more like a love rhombus.
Peter's smarmy boss ("Ally McBeal's" Greg Germann) doesn't understand his underling's need to act, but soon he's carousing with Michael at all hours and snoozing at his desk.
Despite coaching, Peter's performance doesn't seem to be improving, and his ineptitude eventually begins to test Edwina's leap of faith.
The film tries to have some fun with inside jokes, riffing on elements of "Cyrano" and casting Patty Duke in a dual role as never-seen-together twins, which is more believable than her long-ago stint as identical cousins. That allows for a familial pairing with son Sean Astin as a pompous actor feuding with Michael. As perilous tasks go, keeping Frodo alive was doubtless easier.
Vaccaro describes the film as a comedy in the production notes, but you'd have to read them twice to believe it. For while Corbett brings a certain roguish charm to his character, Thomas' perpetual frowny-face portrayal of Peter proves so lifeless the thought of him emerging triumphant is unimaginable, making the basic premise feel more cruel than whimsical.
Somehow, though, the half-dozen producers credited managed to get the film made -- no doubt embracing the underlying message about daring to dream, taking risks and living to the fullest.
These are noble ideals to be sure, but "Bigger Than the Sky" can't bring them to fruition. Or, as Cyrano might say, it simply lacks panache.

Here are two mid-career Seijun Suzuki  opuses that didn't get him in trouble, but should havethe man's timeless disgust with formula and studio prescription radiates like desert heat from his movies, whose narratives are really just cheap suits endured on the wacky path to self-destruction. Fighting Elegy (1966) is as iconic as its title, a jumpy cartoon vision of 1930s Japanese youth culture driven into paroxysms of crazy, militaristic violence by its own sexual frustration. Often as broad as a Keystone two-reeler, the movie is virtually a mission statement by its apostatic director, and was the last Nikkatsu Studio film he made before being fired for Branded to Kill . Youth of the Beast  (1963), at any rate, should've given the company men a hint. Another reimagining of Red Harvest , the film posits Suzuki axiom Jo Shishido  as a dyspeptic, chipmunk-faced thug pitting one yakuza organization against another, but the resulting meth-cranked circus of jazzy chiaroscuro design and cartwheeling sadism has to be seen to be believed. With an essay by Howard Hampton  that's almost as much outrageous fun as the movie itself.
