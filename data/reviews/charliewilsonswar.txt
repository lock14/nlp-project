It's tough selling a picture these days even nominally related to war, so in the past week's blitzkrieg of promotional press for Charlie Wilson's War
, we were reminded again and again of one simple fact: This one stars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts. Yes, yes, it may be about the United States' dubious involvement in another war in the Middle East, in a season of Iraq movies that have failed to spark the viewership's imagination or interest � but this one stars Tom and Julia
. No worries. Accents by way of Hee Haw
 aside, not once in this would-be political romp do we forget that the man and woman before us, embodying such outr� real-life characters as a hard-partying congressman and a born-again Houston socialite, are anyone other than the beloved institutions of Tom and Julia. (It should be noted that a personally beloved institution, Philip Seymour Hoffman, also stars, as an ornery CIA operative, and he's a gas to watch.) Based on George Crile's nonfiction book of the same name, Charlie Wilson's War
 tells the true-life story of how Texan Rep. Wilson (Hanks), best known for boozing and keeping company with Playboy
 Playmates, managed to raise $1 billion with the help of socialite Joanne Herring (Roberts) to secretly fund Afghanistan's mujahideen in their fight against the invading Soviet Union in the early Eighties. Sounds a little wonky, I know, but, as adapted by The West Wing
's Aaron Sorkin (no stranger to making politico speech sound snappy), the historical context and current affairs are laid out clearly and engagingly. That said, there's a hokpoleyness afoot � need I remind you that Sorkin, a TV whiz, is also the guy behind the cuddlebunny The American President
? Same goes with Nichols' flat direction � anyone who's seen Benjamin Braddock squat at the bottom of the family pool in 1967 knows Nichols is a guy with an eye, but rarely does he put it to use in Charlie Wilson's War
. This is a visually and emotionally soft affair, and the material calls for something with far sharper edges. Perhaps there was some confusion � should we play this as a lark or a lesson in geopolitical unrest? � or maybe there was some studio involvement to defang the politics; whatever the case, the noncommittal Charlie Wilson's War
 treads a good-natured but yawning in-between.


Tom Hanks, Julia Roberts, Mike Nichols, and Aaron Sorkin want us to forget about "Rendition" and "Redacted" and "Lions for Lambs." Entertainment and foreign affairs do mix. They've made a movie that strains to prove it. "Charlie Wilson's War" brings us the true-life tale of a Democratic congressman from Texas, played by Hanks, who concocted a covert operation to arm Afghanistan's mujahideen during the Russian invasion. Roberts has a ball playing a slatternly socialite, and we have a ball watching Philip Seymour Hoffman as a coarse CIA agent. What sounds heavy, feels unbearably light. Picture "The Birdcage" with shoulder-guided rocket launchers.
I'm only half-complaining. "Charlie Wilson's War" sure beats the series of lectures, position papers, and political tracts we've been getting all year - urgently concerned anti-entertainments from people like Robert Redford. This movie, directed by Nichols from Sorkin's screenplay, is, in its way, an apolitical comedy about politics. Or at least a naïve one, since those weapons likely eventually made their way into the hands of Al Qaeda.
This movie, too, takes a position: Forget Oliver North, come admire the brave liberal who helped the Afghan people defend themselves against those nasty Soviets. But when it's not jaunting off to refugee camps in Peshawar to jerk our tears, the movie Nichols has made is an amusing bauble that accessorizes perfectly with his other issue movies.
As Wilson, Hanks gives the part a honeyed drawl and an active intelligence you'd have to squint to detect. Wilson is somewhat shrewd and somewhat clueless, but inexplicably attractive and expectedly smooth. He likes to party (we meet him soaking in a Vegas hot tub with some strippers), and he enjoys the perquisites of government. His office is the best of both worlds. In a ludicrous mock-chauvinist joke, four of Wilson's staffers are chesty, big-haired broads (the credits call them "Charlie's Angels"), but they're capable, maybe even smart. Watching them band together to make their boss's drug scandal vanish is like watching spin-doctor night at Hooters. (The splendors of Amy Adams go wasted. As Wilson's prim chief of staff, she's not in on many gags.)
We know Charlie Wilson is to be taken only semi-seriously when he looks up from that Vegas Jacuzzi, sees Dan Rather reporting on the mujahideen for "60 Minutes," and falls instantly in love with the Afghan cause. Ah, screenwriting. Eventually, he makes an ass of himself while trying to cut a deal with Pakistan's military dictator Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq (Om Puri) and, in a funny sequence, brokering an arms deal between Israel and its enemies in front of a belly dancer.
Based on the late CBS News correspondent George Crile's book about Wilson, Sorkin's script relies on political-comedic oversimplifications that are meant to push the story along. As with Sorkin's better TV writing, this tale has a slick surface that Nichols and the actors have a good time treading. Hoffman is especially terrific, playing the miserable, petulant, hideously coiffed fed who really knows Afghanistan. The movie is, more or less, his.
Roberts is more problematic. She shows up as Joanne Herring, the Houston socialite who lets Wilson make love to her (we see only the postcoital talk). She wants him to bring down the commies in Afghanistan and uses her impressive international connections to him help do it. Roberts has big blond hair, an accent as thick as her mascara, and poufy dresses that might as well have been sewn with yeast.
She and Hanks have the delicious, movie-star click you'd expect. But she looks a half-century too young for a part that seems to cry out for Elaine Stritch and Joanne's righteousness helps sour a movie that didn't seem to know what to make of her in the first place. She's a grandstanding Christian know-it-all, whose contradictions ("I talk about God for one reason. We need Him on our side") seem lost on her. In one of the most depressing moments in the movie, she walks by Charlie's Angels and hisses at them: "Sluts."
That moment is typical of the kind of farrago "Charlie Wilson's War" is. In the name of entertainment, it wants to moralize its pleasures away. Lest we forget this is about suffering, too, the movie shows Wilson at that refugee camp being visibly moved by the amputees and burn victims and starving Afghans begging for rations. Then we get a shot of tents that stretch on for as far as the eye can see (this is one of Nichols's ugliest-looking films).
After that trip to Peshawar, suddenly nothing is that fun anymore, even as Hanks begins to lace the character with Clintonian absurdity, such as Wilson's explanation of how he fell in love with America after he could manipulate voters (who happened to be black). The mix of ribaldry, sex, war, and humanitarianism feels unseemly. Never more so than when a shot of an Afghan village littered with the charred debris of an exploded Russian helicopter is chased with a shot that lewdly rises up Amy Adams's hind parts. Thematically, this movie is as promiscuous as Wilson.
It's hard to leave "Charlie Wilson's War" without feeling queasy. Contrary to what Sorkin and Nichols seem to think, the problem is not that topicality and entertainment don't mix. It's that audacity and self-congratulation don't. See, we made an important movie that doesn't feel important, the filmmakers seem to say. We made you think, but we also made you laugh. To that end, the movie is sandwiched by a runny awards ceremony honoring Wilson's daring. You would be forgiven for thinking it's the Oscars.


Charlie Wilson's War , adapted by director Mike Nichols and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin from George Crile's nonfiction best-seller, has a familiar design  it's all about a likable scoundrel who discovers what it means to act out of conviction. The film's underlying twist, though, is tartly ironic. Even as we're cheering on Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks), a back-scratching, log-rolling, good-ol'-boy Texas congressman of the 1980s who stumbles onto the cause of his career when he decides to covertly fund Afghanistan's mujahideen rebels against the Soviet Union, it's never clear if Wilson's ''commitment'' is anything but a more elevated, and naive, form of hubris.
When we first meet Charlie, he's sitting in a Las Vegas hot tub, surrounded by drugs and Playboy  bimbos. Middle-aged and single, a happy alcoholic who can make a Scotch in the morning look like the height of civility, Charlie adores the perks of power and knows how to hold on to them. Hanks, who has been repressing the sleaze he showed in early roles for too long, bites into Charlie's buttery corruption, and Nichols and Sorkin turn the wonkish jargon of politics into light comedy by staying absolutely true to it. There's so much lying going on that each time someone actually comes out with something he believes, it's like the jabbiest of punchlines.
Charlie's awakening is spurred by his alliance with Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts, game if a bit waxy), a wealthy born-again right-wing Houston socialite he occasionally sleeps with. Joanne, more clued in to world affairs than Charlie, wants the U.S. to provide heavy-duty weaponry for the Afghanistan war, which is already turning into the Soviets' Vietnam. Charlie is a Southern Cold War hawk himself (he sits on the Defense Appropriations  Subcommittee), and once he visits an Afghan refugee camp and meets children with their limbs blown off, he has all the motivation he needs. But any overt involvement would play into Soviet propaganda. To facilitate his covert arms plan, Wilson teams up with a slovenly CIA bureaucrat, Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), whose desire to spur U.S. action is comically inseparable from the resentment he feels at a life of third-rate espionage gigs. (No one does petty cubicle rage like Hoffman.) The two forge a passel of strange bedfellows, uniting an Israeli arms dealer with the leader of Pakistan.
Charlie Wilson's War  is a journalistic satire of realpolitik in which our jerry-rigged alliances, which looked strategic at the time, end up biting the U.S. in unforeseen ways. Hovering over the film is the audience's realization that the Afghan war, while it hastened the downfall of the Soviet Union, created the breeding ground for an arguably more toxic threat: the jihad radicals who had nothing but hatred for the West (even as they were only too happy to use its rocket launchers). Instead of running with that irony, though, the movie grows pious about it. The unconvincingly abrupt finale snuffs ambiguity. It says Charlie was right to fight his war  if only Congress had had the will to support his reconstruction dream! All of which sounds a little too close to recently made rationalizations for a certain other war.

 Most of the recent films we’ve seen about the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq remind us what a drag those conflicts are, which may be why so few of us have bothered to go see them. Of course all wars are terrible, but good movies have a way of mitigating that dreary fact even as they acknowledge it. Take the cold war: a “long twilight struggle” (as John F. Kennedy put it) that brought the world to the brink of annihilation and provided a persistent source of tension, anxiety and dread for hundreds of millions of people around the world. Horrible, to be sure. But also kind of a blast.  That, at any rate, is pretty much the gist of “Charlie Wilson’s War,” which may be more of a hoot than any picture dealing with the bloody, protracted fight between the Soviet Army and the Afghan  mujahedeen has any right to be. As the film observes, that fight, in which the United States semi-secretly armed Muslim anti-imperialist  freedom fighters for much of the 1980s, was a prequel to later trouble with anti-Western Islamic terrorists in Afghanistan and elsewhere.  But let’s not get ahead of the story. Before the blowback, after all, a mighty blow for freedom was struck by a congressman with an alleged fondness for snorting blow. And let’s not be too quick to dismiss the wisdom of his sidekick, a C.I.A. operative with a bad temper and a worse haircut: “If you’re gonna do this, you might as well have fun with it.”  Fun is this movie’s unlikely and persuasive motto. If it’s the best politically themed movie to come around in a while, that may be because the director, Mike Nichols, and the screenwriter, Aaron Sorkin, grasp that politics, for all its seriousness, is an essentially comic undertak- ing. Their film is never glib or flippant, but instead shows a lightness of touch and a swiftness of attack — 96 minutes to drink some cocktails, make some deals and send the Russians packing —  that stand in welcome contrast to the plodding, somber earnestness of some recent movies I will tactfully refrain from naming.  Not that discretion is necessarily the better part of valor. And it’s hard to imagine a hero as indiscreet as Charlie Wilson, a Democrat who represented Texas’s Second Congressional District in the House of Representatives. Mr. Wilson, who retired from the House in 1996, is played with sly, rascally charisma by Tom Hanks. It is always a pleasure to see Mr. Hanks play against clean-cut type, and here he has the devilish smile of a middle-aged playboy who has woken up in a long-lost guilt-free sequel to “Bachelor Party.”  An unapologetic womanizer —  the type whose lechery seems like a higher form of gallantry — Wilson staffs his office with long-stemmed babes and casually seduces a pious constituent’s daughter (Emily Blunt). He’s a sharp political operator all the same, and also a man of conscience, as his patient, all-seeing assistant (Amy Adams) is pleased to discover.  When we first encounter Wilson, he’s very much in his element: soaking in a Las Vegas hot tub with a Playboy model and a sleazy television producer, among others, his hand wrapped around a glass of Scotch and his mind focused on the consequences of Soviet aggression. God bless America! As understood by Mr. Nichols and Mr. Sorkin, who have filleted George Crile’s fascinating 500-page bestseller into a trim and lively history lesson, Wilson is both an anomaly and a paragon.  A liberal as well as a libertine, he finds common cause (among other satisfactions) with Joanne Herring, a right-wing Houston socialite who loves Jesus and martinis and hates Communism. She is a splendid American contradiction, standing up for liberty and godliness while getting into bed (literally) with a bachelor congressman and (metaphorically) with President Zia  (Om Puri), the military ruler of Pakistan.  Julia Roberts, as golden as an Oscar statue, incarnates Ms. Herring as if paying tribute at once to Barbara Stanwyck and to the legions of anonymous Julia Roberts impersonators toiling in drag clubs across the land. I mean this entirely as praise: Not many movie stars have the wit or the moxie to embrace the camp elements of their own personas, and the character is clearly something of a performer in her own right.  The third player in this high-living, hard-partying jihad  is Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a C.I.A. operative whose first appearance in Charlie Wilson’s office sends the movie tipping, momentarily and deliciously, into pure door-slamming farce. Gust, whose Greek blood and rust-belt background make him something of a misfit among the blue bloods of the Agency, is as frustrated as Charlie is by the refusal of the United States to arm the Afghan resistance, and so the two of them cook up an elaborate scheme involving Israel, Pakistan, a belly dancer and a compliant House Subcommittee chairman (Ned Beatty).  It’s quite a yarn, and the filmmakers relate it with clarity and verve. The film’s high spirits are inseparable from its sober purpose, which is to present a gentle corrective to the idea that American heroism resides only in square-jawed, melancholy stoicism. That has been the preferred post-9/11 stance, and there is some evident nostalgia in “Charlie Wilson’s War” for the simpler world of the 1980s, when the bad guys flew MIGs and American political life was perhaps a touch less sanctimonious.  But there is nonetheless a bracing, cheering present-day moral to be found in Charlie Wilson’s story, a reminder that high principles are not incompatible with the pleasure principle. The good guys are the ones who know how to have a good time, and who counter the somber certainties of totalitarianism with the conviction that fun is woven into the fabric of freedom.  “Charlie Wilson’s War” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, drug references and violence.

"Charlie Wilson's War" is that rare Hollywood commodity these days: a smart, sophisticated entertainment for grownups. Based on the late George Crile's sensational bestseller about how an unlikely trio of influential and colorful characters conspired to generate covert financial and weapons support for the Afghan Mujahideen to defeat the Russians in the 1980s -- and armed America's future enemies in the process -- Mike Nichols' film is snappy, amusing and ruefully ironic. But not even the stellar talent on both sides of the camera may be enough to make these qualities alluring to general audiences or those much under 40, making B.O. prospects a mid-range thing.
Crile's 2003 book unfolded the full story of exploits little noticed when they happened, a story that once more proves truth can be stranger than fiction, and in this case far more outrageous. Charlie Wilson was a liberal Democratic congressman from East Texas known as "Good Time Charlie" for his swinging-bachelor lifestyle. He had women everywhere (including, as the book points out, the present director's current wife, Diane Sawyer) and was a big-time boozer, but also possessed a strong knowledge of history and a keen interest in foreign affairs.
Although the narrative begins with Charlie (Tom Hanks) in a Las Vegas hot tub with three naked ladies and another guy -- and soon has them all doing coke in a limo -- Nichols and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, who knows a thing or three about Washington, D.C., generally play down Charlie's more licentious and easily caricatured aspects in favor of his bright, inquisitive and resourceful traits. Charlie is the first to admit his faults, but his most salient talent is as a master operator who can talk to and get along with anyone. Hanks, who in certain ways does not ideally match up with Charlie's cocky personality and looks, persuasively puts across the crucial smoothness and charm.
Igniting Charlie's passion for helping the Afghans in the wake of the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion is Houston socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts), a beauteous and connected power broker who uses her intimacy with Charlie to convince him to do what Congress is unwilling to do: End the Cold War by helping the ragtag Afghan holdouts defeat the Russkies.
Joanne arranges for Charlie to meet Pakistan's President Zia (a sternly wry Om Puri) in Islamabad, where, despite his faux pas of asking for booze during his audience with a fundamentalist Muslim leader, the ball starts rolling, and the suffering Charlie witnesses during a visit to an Afghan refugee camp turns the fire in his belly to full flame.
There are many stages leading to the point where this good old boy is able to up his government's unpublicized funding of the anti-Soviet jihad from $5 million to $1 billion per year. But the main objective is getting the Mujahideen weapons to shoot down fearsome Russian helicopter gunships, and, in this endeavor, Charlie receives critical help from maverick CIA op Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman).
If the movie just glides along amusingly at first while dispensing obligatory exposition, it starts firing on all cylinders once Hoffman shows up. Decked out with a pouffy '80s hairdo, moustache, protruding gut and ever-present smokes, Hoffman's Gust moves into a room, plants himself there like an unmovable oak and lets loose with a barrage of delicious verbiage that is equal parts exceptional expertise and withering invective. This reps yet another indelible performance from the amazing Hoffman; whenever he's on, the picture vibrates with conspiratorial electricity.
Knowing Israel has a limitless stash of Soviet-made weapons (and the CIA may not supply U.S.-made weapons to the Afghans), Gust arranges an unthinkable deal between the Jewish state and Islamic Pakistan, a deal furthered when Charlie brings his own Texas belly dancer to perform for officials in Cairo.
While battling drug charges at home that threaten to send him to prison (a federal case pointedly led by one Rudolph Giuliani), Charlie uses his position on the Defense Appropriation Subcommittee to maneuver cash and kindle support for his cause. When Stinger missiles finally find their way to the Afghan rebels, the tide turns, leading to the Soviet retreat in 1989.
Given the density of the story, the hefty number of characters and the governmental arcania involved -- Crile took well over 500 pages to lay it all out -- it's impressive how Nichols and Sorkin have compressed the essentials down to a trim 94 minutes (sans final credits scroll). This is the kind of big Hollywood movie on a big subject with big stars that one would expect to clock in at two hours and 20 minutes. That happens to be what Nichols' previous political comedy, "Primary Colors," ran, so it's possible he learned from that outing, which would likely have benefited from similar brevity.
The pacing of "Charlie's Wilson's War" is exceptional. The material provides much to think about and discuss afterward, but Nichols doesn't pause for reflection while it's all unfolding onscreen. The tempo and balancing act achieved by the director and editors John Bloom and Antonia Van Drimmelen are virtual perfection.
Some 37 years later, there are interesting echoes here from Nichols' film version of "Catch-22" relating to illicit activity by those in government service, absurd juxtapositions, unimaginable eventualities and unofficial history. At the same time, given Nichols' roots in comic theater, it's no surprise that the funniest scene in the film is straight out of French (or Broadway) farce, as Gust is repeatedly asked to absent himself from Charlie's office as the congressman deals with other crises.
While one could have expected most filmmakers, even these, to hammer home the story's dark contemporary irony, it's handled lightly, with a beautiful line of dialogue about how the ball you've set in motion can keep bouncing even after you've lost interest in it. There's no epilogue, only a framing device that seems to sincerely honor Charlie's efforts to a surprising degree.
But it's a film that adores character, something everyone here has in spades in one way or another. The book's Joanne Herring comes off as hugely charming and sexually manipulative, whereas Roberts effectively plays her as almost single-mindedly cunning and Machiavellian. Amy Adams, a star since last weekend in the wake of "Enchanted," is perkily energetic as Charlie's adoring assistant; Ned Beatty has the old pro politician act down pat as a key recruit to Charlie's cause; and Ken Stott gets off some wonderful lines and reactions as a crucial Israeli arms connection.
Craft contributions, notably Stephen Goldblatt's lustrous lensing, Victor Kempster's versatile production design and Albert Wolsky's evocative period costuming, are first-rate.

Hell of a thing, getting Mike Nichols  to adapt the yer-kiddin' -me story of Charlie Wilson , the congressman from Lufkin , Texas, who damned near single-handedly helped the Afghans kick out the Russians in the 1980s. Says right there on page 11 of the paperback edition of George Crile 's 2003 book Charlie Wilson's War  that Wilson "flaunted" his brief relationship with a network newcomer named Diane Sawyer  back in 1980. She calls him "tall and gangly and wild," possessing an "ungoverned enthusiasm" that "extended to women and the world," how-dee-doo. This was about eight years before Sawyer married Mike Nicholswho has now made a movie about how his wife's ex more or less put an end to the Cold War without anyone really noticing.
Seems about par for the course with this story, in which everybody knows somebody who can do something to shape the course of something goin' on in the wide, wide world of sports, politically speaking. You've got a liberal congress- man from the Bible Belt who loves him some booze and beaver; a mighty beautiful Houston socialite who counted among her many exes an oil man connected to sheikhs and intelligence-community power brokers; a disheveled, disgruntled CIA  man looking to put the wood to the Ruskies; Egyptian, Israeli, and Pakistani officials brokering arms deals over belly-dancing distractions; Playboy  Playmates soaking in hot tubs; thenU.S. attorney Rudy Giuliani  sniffing at the congressional coke sniffers; and assorted other do-gooders and up-to-no-gooders trying to keep secret the biggest covert war ever conducted by the good ol' U.S. of A.
Nichols, directing Aaron Sorkin 's screenplay based on the late 60 Minutes   producer's exhaustive book, certainly gets the tone right: The big-screen Charlie Wilson's War , clocking in at 93 fly-by minutes, is dark and funny and mean and sexy, damned near pitch-black-perfect considering that at the end of this boozy comedy you wind up with, oh, Osama bin Laden . And Nichols is suited to the talethis being the Mike Nichols of Catch-22 , The Graduate , and Primary Colors  (which is to say, the satirist), not the Mike Nichols of Working Girl , Postcards From the Edge , and Regarding Henry   (which is to say, the moralist).
Wilson, played by Tom Hanks  with an accent a little more Suth'n than Texan, is Nichols's kind of hero: fucked up beyond belief, but not beyond redemption. In the movie, as in life, Wilson's the "pussyhound" (as Molly Ivins  called him) who drinks Scotch on the Hill during working hours, keeps a staff of beautiful women collectively known as "Charlie's Angels," and more than likely enjoys cocaine in the company of strippersto which Nichols and Sorkin say, "So what?" The way they depict it, a man could have just as good a time getting laid as saving a country; it's just a different kind of explosion, that's all. They don't judge. They admire .
And whispering sweet somethings in Wilson's ear is his better half in this adventure: Joanne Herring , who's smitten with the cause of the mujahideen in need of U.S. military  might and moolah. Herring, a Minutewoman who once married an actual baron, was as much the actress as the woman portraying her (Julia Roberts ). As Crile points out, she, too, was all about reinventionfrom lil' ol' nobody to Houston TV talk-show host to a dear, dear friend of Pakistan 's president Zia ul-Haq . She's more than happy to share bed, bath, and beyond with Charlie if he'll shoot a few million toward the freedom fighters in Afghanistan saving those people, well, it's the role of a lifetime.
And then there's the third member of their love triangle: CIA agent Gust Avrakotos, the only man with whom Wilson could have pulled off his billion-dollar war. Avrakotos was a bored, disaffected "rogue" agent for whom killing Russians was a right, not a privilege, and Philip Seymour Hoffman  is a dead ringer for the chain-smoking skirt-chaser. Avrakotos and Wilson are brothers from another mother. Add Herring to this and you've got one outrageous unholy trinity.
Sorkin, the master at commingling the snarky with the sanctimonious, is the right man for the job, too: After years of wandering a lonely West Wing  , he's unleashed in the desert and the bedroom with men and women far more interesting than his fictional president and fawning, yawning staffers. Charlie Wilson's story is right up Sorkin's dark alley (Hollywood 's too) as it's another dark comedy about our historical gaffes, punctuated by the oh-shit laughas in, "Oh, shit, I can't believe we did that ." (Catch-22  and M*A*S*H  are the forbearers of the genre, from which we have such sneering offspring as Three Kings , Buffalo Soldiers , Lord of War , and last year's The Situation .)
The punch line to Charlie Wilson's War  is that after spending $1 billion on helping the Afghans liberate their country from the God-hatin' Ruskies, we refused to pony up a lousy $1 million to rebuild their schools. Oh, shit, I can't believe we created the devil.  Who needs writers? You can't make this oh-shit up.
