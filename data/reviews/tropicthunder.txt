"Tropic Thunder" only sounds like a Thai porno. It's actually American porn set in the jungles of Vietnam. The non-jungle parts of this crude showbiz circus usually have something to do with a character called Les Grossman, a sleazy Hollywood movie executive with giant forearms, thinning gray hair, psoriasis on his fingertips, and an imbecilic, over-budget Vietnam-era blockbuster called "Tropic Thunder" on his hands.
The makers and marketers of this movie - the one you're paying to see, not the one Grossman is paying to produce - have done an admirable job of keeping to themselves the amusement that beneath Les Grossman's furry chest and thick padding is Tom Cruise. Of course it's hard to ignore a character who's the keystone of one of the most outlandish American farces since Alexander Payne's "Election." This movie, written by Ben Stiller, Etan Cohen, and the actor Justin Theroux and directed by Stiller, will certainly make more money, which will tickle the executives, like Grossman, that "Tropic Thunder" wants to send up.
The movie also wants to laugh at the hubristic spectaculars that men like Grossman love to make money from. The "Tropic Thunder" within "Tropic Thunder" is based on a memoir by a craggy Vietnam veteran (Nick Nolte) with two hooked arms. Its director (Steve Coogan) has dragged a huge crew to Southeast Asia with the intent of filming a movie about five army men behind enemy lines. When an attempt to add grit and spontaneity to the proceedings adds too much of both, the actors playing the soldiers are on their own but still think they're being filmed.
Stiller casts himself as a fading action star desperate to be taken seriously as an actor (he just made a bomb in which he played a severely mentally disabled man). Robert Downey Jr. plays an Australian with five Oscars desperate to be taken seriously as black (he's undergone an improbable Negrofying procedure). Jack Black, waist deep in his most interesting assignment ever, plays a comedy star and junkie. They're paired with two kids who hold their own on the movie's all-star team: Jay Baruchel, as the young nobody actor playing a nerd soldier, and Brandon T. Jackson, playing a raunchy hip-hop star named Alpa Chino, who can be seen in the uproarious spoof ads that precede the film selling a soft drink called Booty Sweat.
They too wind up behind enemy lines in a jungle where the locals are in the middle of some kind of drug war. (One side's leader is an exuberantly nasty kid played by Brandon Soo Hoo.) And so art and life begin to cannibalize each other. In some future time we may look back on "Tropic Thunder" and ask, "What were we thinking?" But a movie that asks Cruise to slap the air as part of a horse-riding dance popularized by the R&B singer Ginuwine takes some time to recover from. So does one in which Downey appears to be playing Jude Law playing Kirk Douglas playing the late Bernie Mac. Black at some point finds himself tied, mostly naked, to a tree, promising sex to the first man who'll help him get high.
As a director, Stiller gives us too much. There are stretches during the middle where we might be the prisoners of war. Watching actors trudge through the jungle is a lot more fun in early Werner Herzog than mid-period Stiller. But the movie is guided up to a point by the sort of insanity you rarely find in a comedy, where the stars and the material are reaching for the comic versions of the crazy demons that possessed Francis Ford Coppola and his production of "Apocalypse Now." Black's running through the entire picture in a cold-turkey sweat simultaneously confirms that the actor is best left on a movie's back burner and captures how Chris Farley might have played Judy Garland. Nobody in the movie acts. They just do drag.
Of course, the satirical aims of "Tropic Thunder" aren't the great modern war movies per se. (Thank goodness, since Stiller comes much closer to making "Delta Force 3" than "Apocalypse Now.") His "Tropic Thunder" cost close to $100 million to produce, and it seems like a movie made while no one at Paramount was paying much attention. It's an illusion, of course. The movie feels like a consciously happy accident whose offenses (mocking a people who'd worship a turkey about mental illness) are roughly balanced by actors gouging out their own narcissism. And yet this is a movie that still includes a feel-good Oscar ceremony as part of its coda and the most affectionate depiction of a Hollywood agent ever filmed.
And so "Tropic Thunder" is a satire of the Hollywood industrial complex that also feels very much a product of that complex. The jokes are cheap, the big action set pieces are not. Things explode - including cliches. But ultimately those are reassembled and embraced. The movies Stiller has directed ("Reality Bites" and "Zoolander") and a lot of the acting he's done mock vanity and selling out while admiring themselves in the mirror, sending up stars like Cruise while very much wanting to emulate his success. In "Tropic Thunder" Stiller's toned muscles aren't part of the joke.
Despite its contradictions, the film stayed with me after I left the theater. It's frivolous. But it's also powerfully surreal. "Tropic Thunder" isn't about the morality of war. It's about the bad taste of producing certain war movies, the hubris not to take us to war, per se, but to repackage it as adventure. The studio chiefs, the directors, the talent, even the effects guys are tyrants, slobs, creeps, frauds, and wimps.
Thanks to Cruise's indelibly unembarrassed performance, the film's heart of darkness is Les Grossman. The actor isn't funny per se. We've seen him curse people out before. He is fascinating, though. We're supposed to find him villainous. But Grossman is the only person in the movie who knows who he is. He's rich. He's ruthless. And he's the one really making our movies. Watching him kiss a gold chain and do a little dance during the final credits is chilling and weird. We're seeing a movie star have the time of his life playing a war criminal.


Let's assume that any gimlet-eyed son in the high-energy household of famous comedians Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara  would have had a rare opportunity to observe creative self-absorption and celebrity neurosis at close range. Still, that accident of showbiz genetics doesn't do credit to Ben Stiller 's unique powers of ruthless insight into the Homo thespianus , and to his talents for a hilarious conjuring of the species.
A good Stiller project, from Zoolander   to Dodgeball  , is likely to be about a voluble extrovert of exquisite short-guy egotism, with insecurity nipping at his shoes and fury goading him on to fine eruptions of pomposity as delightful for the audience as they are blood-pressure-raising for the blusterer. Now comes Tropic Thunder  , the very best and funniest of them, about a small army of such strutting peacocks, a cast of actors off on an acting adventure on the set of a war picture in the jungles of Southeast Asia.
How up their own tushies are these paragons of overpaid Hollywood privilege? They wander into the middle of a real drug war that doesn't conform to the rules of on-location productions  no assistants nearby with bottled water, no fake bullets  and they don't even know it. This is Stiller's Hellzapoppin' Apocalypse Now   the ultimate fighting machine of comedies-about-the-making-of-movies. It's raunchy, outspoken  and also a smart and agile dissection of art, fame, and the chutzpah of big-budget productions that just so happens to include a naked, bleach-blond Jack Black , as a drug-addled movie star, draped over the back of a water buffalo.
About that eyeball-searing image: Black plays Jeff Portnoy, a John Candy -like performer trying to show he can embody more than a flatulent fatty in the gas-passing comedy franchise that earned him his fortune. Stiller, who directed and co-wrote the script with Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen, plays Tugg Speedman, an action superstar no longer so super. (His Scorcher  series has begun to die hard; his big attempt to stretch his range, playing the mentally handicapped title role in Simple Jack , was a failed attempt at prestige and yet undoubtedly more watchable than I Am Sam  .) And in a virtuoso turn from everyone's favorite redeemed virtuoso, Robert Downey Jr.  elegantly dispatches the mishegoss  of Method acting with his double-difficulty feat of playing Kirk Lazarus, an Oscar-loaded Australian artiste who commits to the role of an African-American soldier by undergoing skin pigmentation  and speaking in a Shaft-meets-Uncle Ben patois even when the camera is off. Such shtick wears thin on the real African-American in the cast, a rapper-turned-actor played by Brandon T. Jackson.
There's not even room here to linger on Tom Cruise 's eye-catching, image-salvaging romp as a puffy, crude, bald, hairy-chested Jewish producer; Nick Nolte 's authoritative turn as the grizzled technical adviser John ''Four Leaf'' Tayback, whose Vietnam memoir is herein being dramatized; the maniacal antics of Pineapple Express  ' Danny McBride  as an explosives expert; or the crucial Brit-twit-comes-to-La-La-Land machinations of Steve Coogan  (soon to be seen in Hamlet 2  ) as the overmatched British director of the bedeviled, behind-schedule, over-budget movie-within-the-movie (also called Tropic Thunder ). The point is that with every character, and with every believably outrageous turn of the plot (beginning with fictional promotional movie trailers preceding the actual feature  each one a perfect comedy haiku), Stiller brings real insider knowledge of  and compassion for  the big business of Hollywood make-believe to bear on a comedy that is itself a superior factory creation of make-believe.
Like a postmodern magician, Downey shows how it's really done  without detracting from the pleasures available to those who don't care at all how it's done, just that the entertainment includes explosions. Even an outsider with no obsessive interest in, say, how to rig the fake blood and severed limbs of movie battle will love Downey's mid-gore Method struggle for character motivation. And all it takes to marvel, through non-PC tears of laughter, at the wisdom delivered by Downey about how to win an Oscar for portraying a handicap is a pulse.
More Tropic Thunder :  &#39;Tropic Thunder&#39;: Protesters picket premiere

 Despite what you may have read lately, the biggest target of ridicule in “Tropic Thunder,” a flashy, nasty, on-and-off funny and assaultive sendup of the film industry, is not the mentally retarded. Rather, the true targets of this extreme comedy’s free-flowing contempt are the stars, makers, brokers, miscellaneous supplicants and even die-hard fans of the movies, who are all portrayed as challenged in some fashion: intellectually, ethically, aesthetically, sartorially, chemically, longitudinally, you name it.  “Tropic Thunder” was directed by one of its stars, Ben Stiller, a professional offender and sometimes very funny man who also shares the movie’s writing credits with Etan Cohen and the actor Justin Theroux (missing in on-screen action here). Over the past decade or so Mr. Stiller has carved out a lucrative niche in the comedy of humiliation, his and everyone else’s. Though this is familiar comic turf (the joke has to be on somebody), he has made it a particular specialty by playing variations on the emasculated patsy — the guy with the penis literally stuck in his zipper in “There’s Something About Mary” and figuratively caught in other roles — who either triumphs over adversity or violently succumbs to it.  The joke is most definitely on, at least initially, Tugg Speedman, the preening, hard-bodied, soft-minded action star Mr. Stiller plays with such intimate knowing in “Tropic Thunder.” A blockbuster sensation who has maxed out the audience’s love with too many sequels and one misbegotten attempt to bait Oscar with a weepie called “Simple Jack,” in which he played a bucktoothed  retarded man, Tugg is hoping to resuscitate his career by going gung-ho and grunt in a Vietnam War movie also called “Tropic Thunder.” With his co-stars — notably Robert Downey Jr. as Kirk Lazarus, an awards-laden Australian, and Jack Black as Jeff Portnoy, a comic partial to fat suits and flatulence — Tugg is headed, yup, into the heartless darkness.  That’s old territory for Mr. Stiller, whose most triumphant excursion into comedy’s dark places remains “The Cable Guy,” a scabrous, much-maligned 1996 riff on mass culture with Jim Carrey at his creepy greatest. “Tropic Thunder” is far slicker than “The Cable Guy” and, given the new film’s obviously lavish budget (the aerial shots alone could bankroll the next Sundance slate), understandably more eager to please.  Mr. Stiller has to seduce the audience he once skewered, which he tries to do by giving it Bruckheimer-size pyrotechnics (the lead actors go AWOL in the jungle) and crude laughs wrung from a host of human frailties. But ever the maximalist, he doesn’t just slice and dice his characters and their weaknesses; he tears them limb from limb, blowing both to smithereens.  And he does it with gusto, especially during the hyperviolent opening movie-set war scene in which body parts go flying, and one actor-soldier attempts to keep his innards from spilling out of his stomach wound. Though this bit is played for obvious laughs and is intentionally phony-looking (the soldier looks as if he had been hit with a big pot of cassoulet rather than mortar), the scene skews more yucky than yukky because Mr. Stiller has so little sense of modulation. He isn’t content simply to decapitate a character, the way, say, Graham Chapman hacked limbs in “Monty Python and the Holy Grail”; he also has to play with the stringy bits hanging from the bloodied neck. Mr. Stiller doesn’t kill jokes: he stomps them to death.  That’s how he ends up blowing what might have been the film’s sharpest scene, involving Kirk’s explanation for why Tugg’s performance as a retarded man in “Simple Jack” doomed his chances for an Oscar, an elucidation that includes a clever taxonomy of all the ways it’s permissible to play intellectually challenged in Hollywood (“Forrest Gump” is statuette-worthy, though not “I Am Sam”) and a grindingly unfunny repetition of the word retard. If Mr. Downey — who at this point in his career apparently can do no wrong, even in blackface — can’t make this bit work, it’s because the bit is unworkable. The pomposity of the Oscars is the hook, but it’s the word retard  that provides the squirm.  There’s a lot of bait-and-switch throughout “Tropic Thunder,” including its use of blackface, which, along with the promiscuous deployment of the word retard, has earned it much of its advance publicity. Though Mr. Downey’s character, who has undergone a skin-darkening procedure to play his part, has been cut from moldy Fred Williamson cloth, he’s also the most recognizably human character in a lampoon rife with caricatures. One of those is played by an actual black man, Brandon T. Jackson as Alpa Chino, a rap entrepreneur who peddles an energy drink called Booty Sweat and is mainly around to mock Kirk’s impersonation, which is the filmmakers’ way of having their chocolate cake and eating it too.  What’s most notable about the film’s use of blackface is how much softer it is compared with the rather more vulgar and far less loving exploitation of what you might call Jewface. Hands down the most noxious character in “Tropic Thunder” is Les Grossman, the producer of the movie-within-a-movie, who’s played by an almost unrecognizable Tom Cruise under a thick scum of makeup and latex. Heavily and heavy-handedly coded as Jewish, the character is murderous, repellent and fascinating, a grotesque from his swollen fingers to the heavy gold dollar sign nestled on his yeti-furred chest.  At one time Mr. Stiller wanted to adapt Budd Schulberg’s brutal satire about a Hollywood hustler, “What Makes Sammy Run?,” to the screen, a long dormant and now perhaps lost project that haunts this otherwise safe film like a wrathful ghost.  “Tropic Thunder” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Extreme carnage and language. 

A smart-alecky sendup of Hollywood in general and action films in particular, "Tropic Thunder" undeniably provokes quite a few laughs, but of the most hollow kind. Ben Stiller's star-laden farce makes every effort to be outrageous as it pokes knowing fun at a troupe of spoiled, self-centered actors who get more than they bargained for making a "Rambo"-like rescue drama in Southeast Asia. Apart from startling, out-there comic turns by Robert Downey Jr. and Tom Cruise, however, the antics here are pretty thin, redundant and one-note. But that note will strike a chord with a substantial, comic heat-seeking audience, particularly of the fanboy and combat-ready stripes, making for hefty late-summer biz.
Seven years after his most recent directorial effort, "Zoolander," Stiller, who penned the script with Justin Theroux and Etan Cohen, is working on a bigger canvas this time, but to similar effect as in his fashion-world satire; once again, he goofs on a familiar creative milieu in intermittently inspired but obvious ways while himself playing a one-time superstar whose career is on the wane.
Nutty tone is instantly set by four faux trailers that intro the stars of the forthcoming Vietnam epic. Along with Stiller's Tugg Speedman, whose "Scorcher" action franchise has run its course, there are fart-comedy king Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black), serious-aspiring hip-hop star Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson) and Downey's Kirk Lazarus, an Oscar-enshrined Australian actor. The mock teaser for Lazarus' latest, a tale of illicit gay love between two Middle Ages priests (the other cameoed by Tobey Maguire), is hilariously marked by meaningful stares and exaggerated foreboding.
Once in the field, the film-within-the-film "Tropic Thunder" doesn't go well. After getting reamed by industry uber-tycoon Lee Grossman (Cruise) for not having the cameras rolling on a multimillion-dollar explosion, the film's crazed Brit director (Steve Coogan, in predictably manic form) decides the only thing to do is to take the leads -- who also include bespectacled newcomer Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel) -- deep into the jungle without crew, assistants or cell phones and make them endure a trial by fire in the cause of heightened cinematic realism.
The surprise, which isn't much of one, is that the hunters become the hunted after being attacked by drug-dealing guerrillas who use real ammo.
Not unlike the pampered, out-of-touch celebrities at the center of the action, the film itself suffers from a lack of grounding. Wacked-out comedy with nutjob characters can certainly operate with artificial logic of its own, but "Tropic Thunder," which is rooted to recognizable, real-world points of reference, is undermined by innumerable small details that don't feel right. Would a film like this have a middle-aged first-time director? Can anyone buy that surveillance cameras positioned around the jungle will yield a showable movie? Five Oscars already for fortyish Lazarus?
It's actually the larger absurdities that yield real comic dividends. First and foremost, Lazarus is a white actor so devoted to his art that he undergoes a pigment dye job to play a black soldier. This potentially risible stunt is put in relief by having the humorously named Alpa Chino, played by an actual black thesp, Jackson, ride Lazarus mercilessly about having usurped a role that should have gone to another brother. Whatever political spin people will want to put on it, the audacity of Downey's performance reps the best reason to see the film. Always a brilliant mimic and quicksilver vocalist, Downey dons matted hair, beard, ghetto-spiked rasp and nearly Olivier-as-Othello makeup to play a grandly self-confident thesp who will take no crap from anyone about his impersonation.
Although nowhere near as sustained or inflected, Cruise's extended cameo as a Hollywood Satan is the other highlight. Looking uglier than one could ever have imagined possible, Cruise has been transformed into a bald-pated, hirsute, porcine, sulfur-mouthed terrorizer who rules the roost from a high-tech bunker. At any greater length, the characterization would have to be deepened or it would become tiresome, but Cruise gives it an unexpected spin that makes this a wonderful match with his ferocious supporting turn in "Magnolia."
Beyond these, the performances aren't anything to write home about. As in "Zoolander," Stiller, under his own direction, is mostly about facial and bodily posing, the blond-tressed Black's hyperventilating act as a drug-crazed comic wears out its welcome almost before it begins, Jackson is just OK as the rapper looking for a new career dimension, and Baruchel recedes into the background as things grind on. Nick Nolte is perfect casting for the grizzled, truculent author of the autobiographical book that inspires the film, although how this character evolves proves unsatisfying. Matthew McConaughey aces the supporting role of Speedman's slick but besieged agent.
One of the film's other casting coups is Brandon Soo Hoo, a diminutive 12-year-old who portrays the fierce, cigar-chomping commander of the heroin-producing Flaming Dragon rebels. Probably the most politically incorrect detail of the film is that Speedman is renowned among these remote natives, not for his action pics, but for "Simple Jack," an embarrassing bid for Oscar glory in which he played a retarded man. Thesp's captors force him to re-enact the role as live-evening entertainment, and Lazarus' learned recitation of famous actors who played "retards" reps a comic high point.
Although gussied up visually to the fullest extent of ace lenser John Toll's ability, Stiller's direction remains prosaic. Action is sparked by no end of gunfire, explosions, violent action, verbal eruptions and visual grossouts, which keep the film bouncing along even as the characters and story become no more dimensional than they were at the outset. Tech credits are fine, although some musical choices are overly familiar.

Early buzz out of Hollywood  pegged Tropic Thunder , directed and co-written by star Ben Stiller , as the end-all and be-all of movie-biz parodies—a savage beast with a rough touch featuring Tom Cruise  in a career-resurrecting role as bald-headed, big-gutted, foul-mouthed studio boss Les Grossman , who does the fuck-you dance like nobody's risky business. Bold and brash, with the potential for boffo B.O., noted Hollywood trade and all-access websites that skewer execs with a Q-Tip on a bad day; "savvy" and "authentic" were but two of the kind words whispered by The Hollywood Reporter  , among the myriad insiders who like this Thunder 's roar. Apparently they've never seen an episode of Entourage , which Tropic Thunder  makes look like a Robert Drew  documentary.
Movies about movies date back to the birth of the movie business, and they're all more or less the same: Actors are petulant, entitled, neurotic narcissists (unless they're sweet, sincere baby-faced newbies on their way to becoming petulant, entitled, neurotic narcissists); directors are visionaries easily corrupted or imbeciles easily distracted; and studio bosses are loutish buffoons who've always  looked like, sounded like, and acted like Harvey Weinstein . Hollywood's easy pickings, and making fun of it is what insiders do when they've emptied their arsenal. Tropic Thunder —which drops a bunch of actors into the wilds of Southeast Asia  and shouts "Action!"—doesn't stray far from convention, save for a little added gore, firepower, and star power worthy of its nearly $100 million budget.
Stiller, who hasn't directed a feature since striking a pose as Zoolander  in 2001, is back in the send-up business, nibbling gently at the soft, manicured hands that feed him and co-stars Robert Downey Jr. , Jack Black  (wasted here), Matthew McConaughey  (doing Matthew McConaughey), and, of course, Cruise. It even opens with some short-form satire in the guise of phony movie trailers for an action franchise's latest installment (Scorcher VI: Global Meltdown , starring Stiller's Tugg Speedman ), a gross-out comedy (The Fatties: Fart 2 , with Black's Jeff Portnoy ), and overwrought art-house erotica (Satan's Alley , featuring Downey's Kirk Lazarus  and Tobey Maguire  as himself). All of it resides in the land of the obvious, easy chuckle.
When it isn't tossing softballs at the studios, Tropic Thunder  is the very thing it parodies: a wall of noise engulfed in flame. The actors are supposed to be making the archetypal Vietnam  War movie based on the memoirs of an aging hero (played by Nick Nolte , almost as grizzled as his infamous mug shot). It's Apocalypse Now  meets Platoon  times The Dirty Dozen . But days into shooting, rookie director Damien Cockburn  (Steve Coogan ) is already weeks behind, so he drops his cast, which also includes Jay Baruchel  as a can-do kid and Brandon T. Jackson  as a pitchman for an energy drink called Booty Juice, into the jungle in order to achieve vérité . Things go awry when Tugg's taken prisoner by armed thugs farming poppy, and life suddenly imitates art, blah, blah, blah.
Stiller, having long moved on from sitcom social commentary (Reality Bites ) and grim irritainment (The Cable Guy ), is back doing the affable, well-heeled snark of his short-lived 1992 Fox sketch series, and relying on the in-joke that's been out in the open since Charlie Chaplin  was making short films about movie sets in 1916. This year's model, a little too eerily sculpted, is really just another action movie pretending it's not just another action movie. Hence the "parody" angle, which more or less boils down to an agent (McConaughey) with a moral dilemma (a private plane or his client's life?), Downey's Kirk Lazarus going surgical-procedure blackface as the final frontier in Method acting, and the studio boss who pays surrogates to punch directors when he can't actually be on set to lift his own meaty fists.
The film isn't without its occasional pleasures, but they're fleeting and forgettable and buried in debris and drowned out by the inevitable big bang. Kirk, who refuses to drop character till he does the DVD commentary, delivers a perfectly clever speech about how Tugg went "too retarded" in his sole stab at respectability, a movie called Simple Jack  in which he stammered through crooked buck teeth. "Everybody knows you never go full retard," Kirk says, pointing to Rain Man  and Forrest Gump   as proof that you gotta rein it in. "Infantile, yes. Retarded, no." But even that joke about actors playing developmentally challenged in order to win Oscars made its first appearance in the Dead Sea  Scrolls; thing's musty, man.
And that's the thing about satire: It doesn't play past its expiration date. And everything about Tropic Thunder  already feels antiquated. It's just another so-so Ben Stiller movie, this time with Robert Downey Jr. in blackface, which you'd think would be enough, but it's not.
