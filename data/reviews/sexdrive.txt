It's not Sixteen Candles
, but it's not Road Trip
, either. Instead, this comedic car-trip riff on the teen-male libido and the lengths to which it will go to satisfy itself falls somewhere in between part endearing emo love story, part gross-out semen gag-fest, and, very occasionally, a smart, inspired, non-sequitur-laden hoot. Anything that features Robot Chicken
's Green as a sarcastic Amish grease monkey with a penchant for pushing the buttons of unsuspecting "English" can't be all bad, and Anders, who adapted the film from Andy Behrens popular young-adult novel All the Way
, milks the material for all it's worth, so to speak. Goaded into action by his self-assured, indie-suave best friend, Lance (Duke, who seems to be creating a new teen template as he goes along), high school virgin/nice guy Ian (Zuckerman) "borrows" the �69 GTO of his testosterone-enveloped older brother, Rex (Marsden, kicking an obvious homage to Bill Paxton's vicious sib in Weird Science
). Along with secretly insecure, hip-chick buddy Felicia (Crew), they embark on a nine-hour road trip to Poontown, USA, aka the parking lot of Bob's Big Boy, where Ian plans to meet Ms. Tasty, the nom d'amour of his online fantasy girl. Along the way, this emotionally insecure trio of post-John Hughes archetypes (is there any other kind?) runs afoul of such things as Green's smartly played Amish head-tripper, emo heartthrobs Fall Out Boy, and (in the most original teen-comedy grace notes since John Cusack's dorkoid Devo Ts enlivened Sixteen Candles
) McDermott and Young's Game Boy horndogs Andy and Randy. (Seriously. These two deserve their own feature, posthaste.) Hilarity ensues, in dribs and drabs, but this particular road has been already so well-traversed that even the unexpected comic potholes have been pretty well filled in by now. Go rent The Last American Virgin
, and get it over with, already.


Three things and three things only keep "Sex Drive" from being teen-comedy landfill. The first is James Marsden, hilarious as the hero's bully-boy big brother. The second is Seth Green, beyond droll as an Amishman with attitude. The third is the Mexican doughnut costume.
You take what you can get.
In almost all other respects, this hormonal, everybody-must-get-laid farce aims for Judd Apatow territory but lands somewhere between 2000's "Road Trip" and a lesser Cinemax offering from 1987. Josh Zuckerman plays Ian, a winsomely nerdy high school senior who has never scored, mostly because he carries a torch for his longtime BFFL, Felicia (Amanda Crew), a mordant sorta-goth girl.
An online flirtation with somebody named Ms. Tasty leads Ian on a road trip from Chicago to Knoxville, driving his brother Rex's prize GTO toward promised devirginization. Along for the ride are Felicia and Lance (Clark Duke), the required wild-guy best pal; there are stops for carnivals, drag races, cheap sex, true love, and jail. Half of the goings-on end up on YouTube; one of the better jokes here is that everyone is kept busy uploading videos of everyone else.
Still, those of us with long memories - not the target audience - will recognize the set-up as essentially cribbed from 1985's "The Sure Thing," and Lance as a descendant of the great, shambling Curtis Armstrong in '80s comedies like "Risky Business" and "Better Off Dead."
I know Curtis Armstrong. Curtis Armstrong is my friend. Clark Duke, you are no Curtis Armstrong.
Instead, the movie is stolen by Marsden ("Enchanted," "Hairspray") as Rex, a preening hothead who's all motormouth id. When he's off-screen and the heroes are stranded in Amish country, Green steps in as Ezekiel, automotive expert and purveyor of drop-dead sarcasm. The scenes in which Amish youth embark on a rumspringa not terribly far removed from a Roman orgy is the movie's funniest and most original touch.
What will become of Ian and Felicia in this raunchy, high-spirited, but fundamentally tame R-rated comedy? Any teenager worth his fake ID will see it coming a mile away. "Sex Drive" wants desperately to be dirty as hell, but its leads are generic and the carnal comedy is unthreatening despite all the trash talk. The movie's a working definition of "safe sex."


In the '80s, if you went to see a jovial piece of horndogus comedicus  like Losin' It  or License to Drive , it was product, pure and simple. In our era, films like Road Trip  or the new Sex Drive  filter their leering, gross-out, smash-and-grab antics through a scrim of nostalgia. You're no longer just watching raunchy teen trash  you're watching an affectionate homage to the raunchy teen trash of yesteryear. What is new is the way that Internet culture has ratcheted up the shock value. When Ian (Josh Zuckerman), a virgin who thinks he’s met the online hookup of his dreams, jumps into his brother’s 1969 GTO to drive from Chicago to Knoxville, he and his pals  Felicia (Amanda Crew), whom he secretly adores, and Lance (Clark Duke), who adores himself  undergo a set of escapades that run from the sleazy to the sick.
Lance, played with a spew of attitude by newcomer Duke (who could be a baby member of Weezer), finds a few girls of his own, one with a scatological fetish. The sheer pileup of boner gags and the use of a certain three-letter gay slur  I don't even like printing the word, but it's now woefully routine in youth comedy  is relentless. Yet Sex Drive  twits its own lost innocence with a knowing backward glance (the winsome leads deserve a more humane movie), and Seth Green is uproarious as an Amish farmer who speaks in sentences so passive-aggressive, they're like tiny slaps. B–

 The most notable thing about “Sex Drive,” an aggressively puerile, fitfully amusing and sluggish teenage sex comedy, is that it reserves all its creativity for ways to revolt and ostensibly delight its target audience. Highlights/low points: clubbing borderline road kill to death; super-kinky, super-icky sex; a geriatric flasher.  The basic idea is familiar (one virgin, an online hookup, a road trip), as are the backdrops (the mall, suburbia); the central conceit (the hero wants sex but, gee whiz, Andy Hardy, what he really wants is love); the character dynamics (triangular); the repartee (“dude”); the hormonally charged desperation (tasteless sight-gag alert); and the cast composition (many young B-  and C-listers). The probable inspirations include “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” the “American Pie” movies, “The Sure Thing,” the documentary “Devil’s Playground” and every project Judd Apatow has ever breathed on. From the looks of the cherry GTO Judge that rumbles through the story, someone here has watched the Monte Hellman classic “Two-Lane Blacktop.”  The movie was directed by Sean Anders, who, with John Morris, adapted it from a young-adult novel by Andy Behrens. Mr. Anders doesn’t do much with the camera, although the cinematographer Tim Orr, who has shot all of David Gordon Green’s features, certainly knows how to throw pretty light on a scene. Mr. Anders doesn’t have the flair, or perhaps the heart, for gross-out comedy, with timing that tends to lose the beat midjoke. But despite the usual crass exploitation of young female flesh, he does generally right by his cast. The sweetheart leads, Josh Zuckerman and Amanda Crew, are easy to spend time with, and Seth Green as an Amish hipster and Clark Duke as an unlikely lady-killer hit every sweet-and-sardonic note with panache.  “Sex Drive” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gunplay, raunchy language, partial male nudity and many bared female breasts.

It may not matter to its target aud that "Sex Drive" is nothing more than a raunched-up, dumbed-down version of "The Sure Thing," since most members of that demographic weren't yet born when Rob Reiner's 1985 coming-of-age comedy was released. But since the new pic contains little that's genuinely amusing or minimally original, it likely will fail on its own merits (or lack thereof) as a youth-market magnet in theatrical release. An unrated director's cut might perform slightly better as homevid fare.
Clumsily juggling gross-out gags, cartoonish physical humor and synthetic date-movie sentimentality, helmer Sean Anders offers a bumpy, boring journey in his strenuously unfunny road pic. Even the detours intended to generate big laughs instead underscore pic's overall lack of inspiration.
The formulaic script -- which Anders and producer John Morris adapted from the novel "All the Way" by Andy Behrens -- intros 18-year-old Ian Lafferty (Josh Zuckerman) as a soft-spoken, sweet-natured dweeb who's eager to relieve himself of his virginity.
Driven to desperate measures by the verbal (and sometimes physical) abuse of his horndog older brother, Rex (James Marsden), Ian needs only slight encouragement to "borrow" Rex's prized vintage Pontiac GTO for a long-distance trip to ... well, to a sure thing.
Accompanied by Lance (Clark Duke), a nerdy-looking but self-assured buddy who's improbably successful as a ladies' man, and Felicia (Amanda Crew), a longtime "best friend" with whom he'd like to be a lot friendlier, Ian sets out on a 500-mile trip from Chicago to Knoxville, Tenn., to meet a curvaceous hottie he found on the Internet. Along the way, a few side trips are taken and a few life lessons are learned. But the only roadside attractions of real interest involve a snarky Amish mechanic smoothly played with scene-stealing aplomb by Seth Green.
The moments of low comedy plummet very low indeed -- in one scene, Lance barely escapes being defecated upon -- while Rex's incessant gay-bashing would be offensive if it weren't so numbingly tedious. An "ironic" twist in pic's final moments is clearly meant to humanize this grating character, but it doesn't.
Also arriving too late: an utterly predictable romantic wrap-up that comes off as a shameless sop to young femme auds.
"Sex Drive" borrows indiscriminately from dozens of earlier, better youth-skewing comedies, but it leaves one yearning for the subtle wit and delicate nuances of, say, "Porky's."
Thesps are more or less left to their own devices, but only Green and (to a lesser degree) Duke distinguish themselves. Production values are unremarkable.


Between his unsympathetic family and his demeaning doughnut-shop job, the likable-but-luckless Ian (Josh Zuckerman ) is a prototypical teen-movie protagonist with a prototypical teen-movie conflict: He's still a virgin. Naturally, a prototypical solution must follow. With his two best friends (played by Amanda Crew  and Clark Duke ), Ian steals his brother's 1969 Pontiac GTO  and embarks on a road trip to hook up with his Internet crush. Heralded by Porky's  and perfected by John Hughes , the post-pubescent sex comedy is a genre as identifiable as the film noir or the western, and Sex Drive  doesn't miss any of the motifs. Sweet muscle car? Check. Terroristic older sibling? Check. (In frosted tips and cut-off sweatshirt, James Marsden  relishes the role.) Ample amounts of T&A? Check. Yet, rather than wink at adults with a knowing rehash of early '80s iconography, director and co-writer Sean Anders  aims for the only audience that counts: the youth of today. Like Superbad , Sex Drive  maintains its belief that the average modern teenager is funnier and more compelling than the stereotyped hipsters of Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist  or the fantastic figurines of High School Musical . Even as Ian's journey detours into National Lampoon  –like farce, the movie remains faithful to a portrait of teens as they see themselves.
