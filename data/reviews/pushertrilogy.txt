 From the mean streets of Copenhagen — they evidently exist — comes the “Pusher” trilogy, a pungent dose of Denmark rot. Written and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn, this tough trio of underworld thrillers sticks so close to its rogues’  gallery of gangsters, suckers and murderous megalomaniacs that you can almost taste the hate and smell the stomach wounds. Given an appetite for grisly crime flicks, they make for a delectably nasty epic.  Previously released in the United States in 1999, the  first “Pusher” traced the downward spiral of a petty thug named Frank (Kim Bodnia) as he scrambled to make things right with Milo (Zlatko Buric), a superbad kingpin. Frank’s fate went unresolved at the end of the picture (Mr. Refn excels at the ambivalent finale), while that of his sidekick Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen) seemed certain, there being only so much bludgeoning a head can handle.  Left for dead, a casualty of his buddy’s furious desperation, Tonny survives and is resurrected as the antihero of “Pusher II: With Blood on My Hands.” We pick up his story in jail, and wince as he’s promptly served a fresh beating by the inmates. Once paroled, his skull a Frankenstein quilt of scars and tattoos, Tonny goes cruising for more bruising.  This time it’s a family affair, with his icy father, Smeden (Leif Sylvester Petersen), offering shady business opportunities and intolerable acrimony. Plus there’s a newborn son courtesy of a former fling with zero mothering skills but a great talent for snorting cocaine. Once more the walls close in, options are squeezed,  and the conclusion is indeterminate, but the material has matured. Where “Pusher” worked fresh texture and authenticity into a classic noir template, “Pusher II” reaches toward the mode of hyperrealist allegory perfected by the Dardenne brothers. Tonny’s tale is kin to, and might well have been called, “The Child.”  “Pusher III: I’m the Angel of Death” risks repetition as it puts Milo through the paces run by Frank and Tonny. Yet by now the atmosphere is so thick, the talk so assured, the performances so disciplined and the fear so fearsome, that Mr. Refn’s final iteration of his pattern achieves the hard, bright light of an archetype from hell.  We catch up with Milo at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting on the morning of his daughter’s 25th birthday, for which he has promised to cook for 50 guests, a task seriously derailed by the unexpected appearance of 10,000 hits of Ecstasy. Gripped in a nightmare of multitasking and increasingly strung out on drugs, Milo maneuvers against a new generation of pushers — and the villains in his soul.  The trilogy comes to its terrible, inevitable end with a sequence that renders men into meat, a thing to be bought, butchered, consumed and expelled. A word to the squeamish: it does this most literally. The “Pusher” films pull no punch. They’re a knockout.  PUSHER  
Your first impression of this five-hour-plus underworld trilogy is that director Nicolas Winding Refn is an engineer of epic scale and structural ambition, and that the tiny kingdom of Denmark  is apparently a snake pit of narcotic squalor and homicidal chaos. (Distributor Magnolia is displaying no shortage of chutzpah itself in releasing all three simultaneously, a market-defying stunt it pulled in 2004 with Lucas Belvaux 's weave-world saga The Trilogy .) But the Pusher  movies play less like features than like the nastiest hit TV series HBO  never made, and a stateside cable remake does seem plausible. Shot handheld, dramatically focused not on large narrative arcs but vile criminal minutiae, and inhabited completely by scumbags dumbly searching for redemption they can't put a name to, Refn's films aren't freestanding once their serial-ness becomes their defining characterjust as with The Sopranos  , the narrative's forward motion is aiming at a vanishing point, not at closure. (Refn has said there may be more Pusher s to come.)
Still, the textures of Refn's wallow in bad behavior are completely convincing, if the plot-stuff is a little familiar and if the overarching notion that, as Quentin Tarantino  said somewhere, "gangsters have kitchens, too" seems by now valid but no longer terribly fresh. Drug lords cook for parties, hit men dream about becoming restaurateurs. In the first Pusher  (1996), first released here in 1999, the hero is Frank (Kim Bodniahalf Stanley Tucci , half Tom Sizemore ), a mid-level dope dealer (apparently, "pusher" in Danish has different connotations: No one ever needs to "push") who is successful and hardcore enough to live his days in a fast, fun-loving tear. Accompanied by his bullet-headed buddy/enforcer Tonny (Mads Mikkelsen ), Frank spends the movie's first half-hour bopping from deal to whore to bar, cagily living it up. Bad news arrives, of course, in the offhand form of a score finagled with local kingpin Milo (Zlatko Buric ) on credit, despite Frank's looming debt. When the cops show up, Frank dives into a lake, taking the drugs with him. Now his debt to Milo is unmanageably huge, and as the thugs come looking for him, he begins a frantic, frustrated search for cash. Refn's filmhis first-is alive with details: the conversations that you think will provide exposition but instead get completely sidetracked; the live-wire torture scene that ends, abruptly, when the lights go out; the way Frank, as the clock slowly runs out of time, becomes less expressive, not more.
Picking up this spare thread eight years later, after himself getting married and fathering a child, Refn focuses each subsequent film, perhaps perversely, on the one character from the previous entry you have no interest in learning more about. We don't revisit exiled Frank in Pusher II (2004), but the irredeemably dim Tonny, last seen bludgeoned by Frank for leaking to the pigs, and now fresh from prison. Re-immersing himself in a daily cesspool of coke, dope deals, car thieving, and whores (the early scene in which Tonny argues with his own unresponsive penis as two disinterested working girls obey his frustrated commands is rankly funny), Tonny also tries to ingratiate himself with his recalcitrant father (Leif Sylvester Petersen ), who can hardly trust him with a gopher job at his chop shop. The back-breaking straw is the appearance of a baby that Tonny's old non-girlfriend (Anne Sorensen ) claims is his; as the bitterness, betrayals, and wholesale fuckups snowball, Tonny begins (slowly, silently) to wonder if he should rewrite his life, and the fate of the neglected infant.
Pusher III  (2005) trains in on Milo, the Balkan scag kingpin and Frank's biggest problem from the first film. Here, he's in Narcotics Anonymous  and truly interested only in cooking a massive birthday feast for his 25-year-old daughter (Marinela Dekic ). Meanwhile, an errant shipment of Ecstasy and a handful of Albanian and Polish crooks are perpetually mucking up the works, until bodies start dropping and Milo (Buric may be the unhealthiest-looking actor on earth), succumbing to a smack high, endures a hair-raising night's journey into corpse disposal the meat-market-scrap likes of which we haven't seen since Herschell G. " 2,000 Maniacs " Lewis retired. Truly, Refn could keep going; there may be no limit to the fuzzy-underbelly-ness behind Copenhagen 's semi-industrial storefronts, even if you're given reason to wonder, after many hours, if these buzz-seeking losers ever eat a square meal, feel any social remorse, or get any sleep.
