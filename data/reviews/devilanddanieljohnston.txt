         If you're already a fan of cult musician Daniel Johnston, you've been counting the days until the arrival of the new documentary on the man and his life, "The Devil and Daniel Johnston." If you're not a fan, you're going to wonder what the fuss is about.
 
  Not that Johnston, a singer-songwriter with an unmistakable reedy voice, is without noticeable gifts. His tunes have been covered by the likes of Beck, Wilco, Sonic Youth and Pearl Jam, artists who've fallen in love with eccentric lyrics such as "I lived my broken dream" and "Running water, where are you running from."
 


         






    Nor has this particular life been lacking in drama. Currently 42 and living with his parents, Johnston has been manic-depressive since college. He was in and out of mental hospitals for decades, subject to all manner of delusions, visions and violent fantasies, many of them involving the presence of the devil.
 
  Johnston once attacked his closest friend with an iron bar and put him in the hospital. A few years later he nearly crashed the small plane his father was piloting by throwing the keys out the window and putting the aircraft into a dive. A bit of an indie rock Brian Wilson, he was not the easiest guy to have around.
 
  As directed by Jeff Feuerzeig, however, "Devil" turns out to be too indulgent and worshipful a film to justify its length (one hour and 50 minutes, including an interminable section on Johnston in high school), much less hold our attention for the duration.
 
  Dominated by Johnston's closest friends and biggest fans, "Devil" is both too quick and too insistent to call this quirky performer an "incredible genius" and "the best singer-songwriter alive today." Yes, it's true that fan Kurt Cobain took to wearing a Johnston-designed T-shirt, but hasn't anyone ever heard of Bob Dylan?
 
  "Devil" is so eager to venerate Johnston for his suffering it doesn't understand that a) his undeniably painful experiences haven't sanctified him and b) they're more tedious than involving when related in detail on-screen. A performer of formidable self-absorption, Johnston has inspired a film with the same trait, and the results are about what you might expect.

The Devil and Daniel Johnston  is a fascinating and lovingly crafted musical documentary that nevertheless misunderstands its own subject. In the 1980s, Daniel Johnston was a creative young geek with a history of mental problems (he was diagnosed as manic-depressive) who found a cult niche with his warbly, faux-childlike, sub–Jonathan Richman ditties. He gave out homemade cassettes, often rerecording an entire tape for each potential fan  not because he wanted to, but because he didn't know how to dub. His moonstruck lyrics, mingled with his lack of technique and aura of damaged innocence, helped make him a mascot for the ''outsider'' validity of indie rock, but The Devil and Daniel Johnston  presents this haunted footnote as if he were a lost-boy genius on a par with Brian Wilson or the Beatles. That may, of course, be what his fans think, but the bad joke of the movie is that we see Johnston turn himself into a Gen-X icon by merging his open-mike-night novelty act with an unadulterated lust for fame. He's the Chauncey Gardiner of indie rock  a mirror of his audience's I-can-be-a-star-too narcissism  and the movie's infuriating intrigue is that it all but begs us to turn ourselves into groupies to watch it.

 The romantic cliché that all artists are a little bit mad is put through its paces (if never seriously questioned) in this documentary about a mentally ill man whom Kurt Cobain, the lead singer for Nirvana, once called the greatest living songwriter. The youngest son of a fundamentalist Christian family from Virginia, Daniel Johnston grew up with a compulsion to create, churning out Super-8 films, comic-book-style drawings and cassette tapes full of songs and stories. But in college, he began to exhibit symptoms of manic-depression and grandiosity before running away to join a traveling carnival. He wound up in Austin, Tex., where his homemade cassettes of plaintive folk songs made a splash on the underground music scene.  After a brief stint as a curiosity on MTV, Mr. Johnston became a minor celebrity as a self-taught singer-songwriter, but he spent the 90's in a downward spiral, alternating between stays in mental hospitals and brushes with the law. Now in his mid-40's, Mr. Johnston lives with his parents in Texas and continues to make music with a local band, but, as he announces in the film's opening voice-over, he considers himself little more than "the ghost of Daniel Johnston." Jeff Feuerzeig, who won the best-director award at the 2005 Sundance festival, cobbles together a moving portrait of the artist as his own ghost, using a wealth of material provided by Mr. Johnston, from home movies to audiocassette diaries to dozens of original, and often heartbreakingly beautiful, songs.  "The Devil and Daniel Johnston" is rated PG-13 for thematic elements, drugs  and language, including a sexual reference.
Lunatic talent is the siren call to many an overmatched filmmaker, as a random sampling of biopics can attestscrambled brain chemistry is too easily romanticized and lends itself to drab miserablism, yet it can't pass muster as a tragic flaw. The Devil and Daniel Johnston   steers a confident course through this minefield: The titular artist and singer-songwriter's raw genius and cult recognition don't conquer his demons so much as they collaborate, negotiate, and brawl with them. Shot mostly on richly hued Super 16 and stitching together a chaotic life with nary a seam showing, Jeff Feuerzeig 's tremendous documentary runs on the motive force of intelligent fandom and radiates an ineffable grace.
Like its most obvious antecedent, Terry Zwigoff 's Crumb , D&DJ  is as much a family portrait as an artist's profile. A "Christian fundamentalist Glass family," in the words of one friend, the Johnstons of West Virginia  fretted over young Daniel's stubborn eccentricities and monomaniacal devotion to music and drawing. Always with one eye on his legacy, Johnston constantly kept his tape recorder or camera running, and thus D&DJ  has some kinship with Capturing the Friedmans  and Tarnation  as a compendium of compulsive self-documentation. He may well have missed his vocation as an actor-directorin the Super-8 juvenilia It Must Be Monday , Johnston plays both himself and, with the aid of a wig and a rolling pin, his hectoring mother, Mabel, who's good-natured enough to provide commentary on the footage.
During a brief stint at art school, Johnston met Laurie Allen , the Beatrice in his Vita Nuova  of unrequited-love songs; his muse decreed, his stardom awaiting, Johnston ran away and joined the circus, landing in Austin  at the exact moment its music scene blew uproll tape of the boyish McDonald's  employee hustling MTV  with one of his homemade cassettes, Hi, How Are You , in which Johnston's primitive chord-organ musicianship and cracked, bleating voice belie his knack for pure pop melody and surreally plangent lyrics. As his scenester following grows and the dark, violent side of his autistic-savant persona becomes frighteningly evident, D&DJ  testifies to the selfless heroism of his manager, Jeff Tartakov , and of Mabel and Bill, Johnston's now elderly parents and caretakers.
"I am the ghost of Daniel Johnston," the 1985-era Johnston declares in D&DJ 's opening moments, and this phantom haunts the entire movie. Graying and obese in his heavily medicated middle age, the current Johnston bears little resemblance to his Hi, How Are You  incarnation, and he's a nearly silent subject, the film circling respectfully around him. Feuerzeig sometimes re-enacts signature incidents of the biography using a handheld camera that stands in as Johnston's point of view, underlining the eerie intuitions of an absent presence.
Johnston's outbursts and breakdowns subverted his success, caused his loved ones untold anguish, and, of course, bolstered his legend. The documentary holds no illusions about insanity as a career move; there's a whiff of the freak show in Johnston's latter-day concerts but never in Feuerzeig's approach. The Devil and Daniel Johnston  could have closed on a triumphant noteJohnston onstage, fascinating his publicbut the film's candid, clear-eyed humanism can be gleaned by who in the story gets the last word.
