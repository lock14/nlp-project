As the ambivalent title guest in Noah Baumbach's pleasurably painful domestic drama Margot at the Wedding , Nicole Kidman is so unlikable as to be spectacular. Margot is a short-story writer of no small acclaim, steeped in the privileged neurosis and petty, self-important competitions of the upper-middle-class New York intelligentsia, and she's as obtuse about the hurts she inflicts on those closest to her as she is quick to feel real or imagined slights to her own quivering ego. Historically, her younger sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has borne the brunt of Margot's manipulations, so that now the two women are estranged. But at the prospect of Pauline's impending marriage to Malcolm (Jack Black), a blobby underwhelmer with the unbecoming moustache to clinch the deal, Margot bestirs herself. Restlessly unhappy in her own marriage, she traipses out for the event to the Eastern shoreline family childhood home now occupied by Pauline. She also brings her teenage son, Claude (Zane Pais), a sensitive kid whiplashed by his parents' battles, his mother's gusts of selfishness.
Really, the casual emotional gouging and bruising that takes place in the course of this ostensibly happy occasion has every reason to be unbearable, especially in Margot's capacity as a Monster Mother (let alone a Sadistic Sibling) who likes to think she's being sophisticated and honest in her conversations with her son and her sister. But as he demonstrated two years ago with The Squid and the Whale    (and in early form in 1995 with Kicking and Screaming   ), Baumbach possesses an infernally charming skill at leavening discomfort with wit, and a superb ear for the rhythms of chattering-class psycho-destruction. (Far be it from us to assume Baumbach's autobiographical familiarity with the species, but let's assume it anyway.) He's become a specialty master at blurring the line between the dysfunctionally appalling and the articulately entertaining.
So here's Margot, reenacting ancient battles with Pauline (and, indeed, with everyone, since she's incapable of not rubbing a little shmutz  on all who cross her path). If the title Margot at the Wedding  and the name of Margot's sister elide in cineaste memory into Pauline at the Beach, well, Baumbach's allusion to the great French New Wave master of the conte moral , Eric Rohmer, is intended. Like his idol, Baumbach specializes in looking at people who think they want one thing but really want another, and then to set them talking. Certainly, Margot  is all about self-delusion and loose chunks of ensemble doing-and-yakking. Episodes (a family meal, the cutting down of a tree, Margot-the-author's publicity appearance at a local bookstore) don't so much link as accumulate like perfectly chosen souvenirs of an aesthetically high-minded, emotionally screwed-up traveler. And while the adults claw with manicured talons, the young people, including a fine Halley Feiffer as a neighborhood Lolita and Flora Cross as Pauline's prematurely mature daughter, jockey for footing in a perfectly captured teen world of unstable hormones.
Which brings us back to Kidman, who really is  sensational here. She's fearless about being ''ugly,'' fully in touch with her character's voracity, and transformed into Margot with a commitment we don't tend to see enough from the striking star, even as she works tirelessly to update her stardom. Kidman's commitment to working with adventurous filmmakers has always been one of her loveliest attributes, but something in this adventure has truly set her free. The result, for the Kidman curious, is exhilarating.
For Jennifer Jason Leigh fans, meanwhile, the ease that the characteristically taut actress evidently feels working with Baumbach  her husband  is evident in her own notably unguarded performance, her buoyancy. There'd be no itchy, scratchy Margot without a Pauline to torment, and Leigh imbues the role  that of a woman who loves and hates her maddening, famous-author sister in equal, crazy-making measure  with soulfulness, and also with a spine. Some of the movie's sweetest, realest moments are those when the two siblings fall about on the couch laughing, their blood bond thickened by shared history.
Can lives of such advantage be so awful? Can the filmmaker ever go home again? The parents and children, lovers and cheaters who wound one another here are a glossy subset of Leo Tolstoy's universe of unhappy families, each unhappy in its own way. We enjoy, and count our blessings that we are not Margot's kin.

 In Noah Baumbach’s “Margot at the Wedding,” a face is slapped, some punches and kicks are thrown and a gracious old shade tree is subjected to assault by chain saw. It all sounds pretty tame compared with what you might encounter on neighboring screens at the multiplex. This is, as my colleague Caryn James pointed out in a recent essay, a notably bloody season at the movies. So if you are interested in gore and gunplay, you can seek out “Saw IV” or “No Country for Old Men.” When it comes to emotional violence, however, “Margot at the Wedding” is hard to beat.  Mr. Baumbach’s characters exist in a state of highly civilized Hobbesian war: sister against sister, mother against son, neighbor against neighbor, lover against lover. And the combatants do love one another (except for the neighbors, who hurl garbage over the fence and scream obscenities on hiking paths). If they did not, they would be unable to inflict or suffer hurt the way they do, with well-aimed humiliation, cruelty disguised as solicitude and strategic displays of sensitivity and its opposite.  Their high degree of intellectual and cultural refinement — and the mixture of self-loathing and self-regard that is their most recognizable tribal feature — makes these people at once exquisitely vulnerable to pain and adept at causing it. Margot (Nicole Kidman) is a successful novelist from Manhattan. Jim (John Turturro), the husband she is planning to leave, is also some kind of writer, as is Dick (Ciaran Hinds), with whom she’s having an affair. Margot’s sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh), who didn’t speak to her sister for a long time,  does not have any evident profession, but she seems to have made a vocation out of insecurity and self-scrutiny. Her fiancé, Malcolm (Jack Black), whom she describes as “brilliant,” dabbles in music, painting and letters to the editor, though his main achievement is growing a mustache. “It’s meant to be funny,” he says.  And “Margot at the Wedding” is often mercilessly, squirm-inducingly funny. Mr. Baumbach, the child of literary parents, has an unfailing ear for the idioms of the intelligentsia and an acute sense of family politics. The alliances that form in the course of the film’s hectic story, which takes place over a few days in a rambling seaside house, are shifting and unstable.  Margot’s son Claude (Zane Pais)  bonds warily with Pauline’s daughter, Ingrid (Flora Cross). Margot awkwardly reaches out to Malcolm. Pauline turns her needy affection on whoever is in the room. But the occasional moment of kindness or sincerity is, more often than not, a pause in the hostilities, and a chance for the filmmaker to set up another painful comic explosion.  By the end, it all spins out of control in a pileup of exposed secrets, buried lies and moral failures expressed in a cacophony of screams, tears and furious whispers. To the extent that a narrative structure is discernible amid the chaos, “Margot at the Wedding” could be described as a farce. And for all the wild, at times aggressive originality of its literary and visual style, the film belongs to a familiar genre in which a filmmaker gathers a gaggle of kinfolk under one roof for a big event — though Pauline and Malcolm’s must be the most haphazardly organized wedding in film history — and watches the sparks fly, sprinkling gasoline on them when necessary.  This is a fairly shopworn conceit, but Mr. Baumbach’s resistance to cliché is nonetheless admirable. His last movie, “The Squid and the Whale,” was flecked with references to French filmmakers like Jean Eustache and Jean-Luc Godard, and his intention in “Margot at the Wedding” seems to have been to make a French movie with American characters.  This strikes me as, for the most part, a worthy ambition. The Gallic influence is evident not only in the quick, sometimes abrupt cuts between scenes and the intimate, breathless camera work, but also in the way the film is entirely absorbed in the particulars of its characters and their world. You are plunged into their lives rather suddenly — the first scene, riddled with jump cuts and bumpy tracking shots, takes place on a train — and you proceed through a thicket of idiosyncrasies, allusions and private jokes.  We never really find out, for example, why Margot and Pauline did not speak to each other for so many years, but the fact of their estrangement is as believable as their reluctance to rehash its origins for our benefit. The realism of “Margot at the Wedding” — the texture of unpredictable, lived experience that keeps both farce and melodrama in check — lies in its sense of sprawl and untidiness, in the feeling that the movie itself is snipped from an endless tangle of bad feelings and good intentions.  And the characters, unpleasant as they are, are depicted with bracing individuality. Ms. Leigh and Mr. Black have never been better — Pauline and Malcolm, for all their troubles, are at least trying to be honest and kind — and Mr. Pais more than holds his own in very intense company.  As for Ms. Kidman, the more complicated she is allowed to be, the better she is, and a whole school of psychoanalysis could be founded on a case study of Margot. The summary diagnosis might be that she’s just vain, selfish and mean — someone you would back away from slowly before running in the other direction. But if you were her son or her sister — or even her future brother-in-law — you might not have that option, and anyway “Margot at the Wedding,” despite its title and what she might think, is not all about Margot.  And that may be part of the problem with this frequently brilliant, finally baffling film. In the final third, the proliferating complications and dramatic revelations start to feel increasingly rushed and hysterical. There is a fine line between depicting emotional anarchy and succumbing to it, and Mr. Baumbach, eager to avoid anything that might seem obvious, stacks up appalling and improbable climactic incidents that finally undermine the logic of the story. The result is that the audience may tire of the characters too quickly. Yes, they’ve been dreadful from the start, but interesting enough that you at least wanted to stick around and see what they would do next. Which makes your relief at being rid of them (after only 93 minutes!) something of a disappointment as well.  “Margot at the Wedding” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a lot of stuff in it that perceptive children already know, even if adults wish they didn’t.

"Margot at the Wedding" is a circus of family neuroses and bad behavior that perhaps a therapist could make sense of better than Noah Baumbach can. Displaying some of the keen insight into the screwed-up minds of East Coast literati the writer-director displayed so winningly in "The Squid and the Whale" and showing ever-developing instincts as a director, this study of a disastrous reunion of two sisters feels more like a collection of arresting scenes than a fully conceived and developed drama. Certain acclaim from some quarters will fuel good initial B.O. in major cities, but off-the-charts self-involvement of all the characters will stall crossover to wider auds.
This is a clan whose members think nothing of playing out all their psychosexual traumas and intimate personality conflicts in front of their assorted children of all ages; in fact, the adults don't even stop to realize they're doing it. Perhaps some viewers will accept this as brutally honest telling-it-like-it-is, but the spectacle of such heedless self-absorption by people whose job it is to be insightful, as writers and teachers and artists, will prove too great an irony for most viewers to swallow.
Setting the standard for self-absorption for all others to follow is the beauteous Margot (Nicole Kidman), a short-story writer of some note who journeys with her puberty-pushing son Claude (Zane Pais) to the family compound along the Eastern seaboard as surprise guests at the wedding of teacher sis Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh) to self-styled artist Malcolm (Jack Black).
Long estranged, the sisters may fantasize about burying the hatchet for the weekend, but the impossibility of this instantly becomes apparent when Margot, sustained by steady doses of white wine and weed, begins laying into Pauline and trying to talk her out of marrying Malcolm, an obese layabout with nothing apparent going for him. "He's like guys we rejected when we were 16," Margot cuttingly points out, although there is a mitigating factor: Pauline -- who already has a daughter, Ingrid (Flora Cross), a bit younger than Claude -- is pregnant.
Margot has her own hidden agenda. Fed up with her marriage, she has insisted her husband Jim (John Turturro) not come to the wedding. Assuredly not by coincidence, she has a local bookstore appearance scheduled with former flame Dick (Ciaran Hinds), an arrogant fellow writer she seems intent on hooking up with again. Dick's provocative teenage daughter, Maisy (Halley Feiffer), is also around to do her part in stirring the male hormones and spurring subsequent recriminations.
All this reps an unholy stew of ill will, festering emotions, latent resentments, barely disguised agendas and rampant incivility, so it's a tribute to Baumbach's skills as a writer and director that he manages to make spending time with these folks as tolerable as he does. Any number of dialogue exchanges, especially between the sisters, are exceptionally sharp, as old scores are resurrected, new charges are filed and secrets are spilled in a bobsled ride of cascading accusations and emotions.
Stylistically, the film is most exciting in the way Baumbach and editor Carol Littleton boldly cut right into dramatic scenes that are already underway and sometimes jump out of them before they conclude in a normal manner. Many interludes bear a resemblance to the sort of bitter intra-family dialogue one is accustomed to hearing in serious theatrical dramas, but the traditional shaping of such scenes has been scrapped in favor of something that approaches the dramatic equivalent of cinematic jump-cutting.
The rhythm is reinforced by the discreet handheld camerawork by virtuoso lenser Harris Savides, who gets in close but without any jitters or getting into the actors' tonsils. Only the extremely dim, washed-out night and low-light scenes create any visual disappointment.
Thesps are constantly charged up, their nerve endings frayed and exposed. Kidman is the rawest as the most dangerously neurotic and manipulative of the bunch, Leigh the most prone to mood swings, while Black, whose character is not yet a family insider -- more luck to him -- works in a mode of emotional opaqueness that itself may mask the man's intense neuroses. Newcomer Pais is very good as the son who learns way too much too fast.
Strong humor flecks the film's opening passages, and it's a good bet that more of it would have made the latter stages more palatable, as was the case in "Squid." For all the talent on display, many viewers will have had more than enough of these characters well before the relatively brief running time has expired.

There are comedies of discomfort, and then there's Margot at the Wedding , Noah Baumbach 's scalding follow-up to The Squid and the Whale . An immersion in sibling malice and simmering resentment, with one of the most infuriating characters in recent movies holding us under, Margot  tramples the commandment that only the pure of heart and noble of deed are worth a viewer's scrutiny. Hard as it may be to imagine a comedy that inflicts all the psychic torment of Cries and Whispers , Baumbach has pulled off a more psychologically acuteand funnierversion of the Bergman pastiches that Woody Allen  attempted 30 years ago, with a jumpy, nerve-rattling rhythm all his own.
Played by Nicole Kidman , all sculpted cheekbones and blithe venom, Margot could be the dejected, midlife, midlist-career-and-a-busted- marriage-later version of the hyperliterate post-grads in Baumbach's first feature, 1995's Kicking and Screaming people whose education taught them to parse others' sentences for slights. Introduced en route by train to her sister's wedding, Margot initially doesn't seem so badalthough it's an ill omen that the passenger her gangly adolescent son Claude (Zane Pais ) mistakes her for is some random sourpuss.
But within moments, Mom outs herself as a Rommel of passive aggressionthe kind who can accuse other parents of denying their child's autism, advise her sister to stay out of Williamsburg  because it's "for the young," or gaze sadly at her son and sigh, "You used to be more graceful." "We're supporting her," Margot says firmly of attending her sister's nuptials, of which she doesn't approve. "I thought she wasn't speaking to you," Claude says. "I wasn't speaking to her ," she corrects him, "but I'm over it now."
Their destination is a Long Island  family home, Chekhov by way of Cheever, where the happy event is to take place. The introduction of sister Pauline (Jennifer Jason Leigh ) typifies the movie's racing pulse: She's shown standing still as Margot arrivesthe cinematic inhaling of a deep breathand smack! , a jarring cut catches her in mid-stride, shoving her toward a reunion she clearly dreads. (Editor Carol Littleton 's unobtrusive jump-cutting sharpens the senses throughout.) As her fiancé, lumpen music critic manqué Malcolm (Jack Black ), punches up the vows with a little levity ("Not jokey," he explains defensively, "more character-based humor"), the sisters settle in for a weekend of rapidly deepening anxiety.
As in The Squid and the Whale , Baumbach's chosen milieu is the company of educated, intelligent, empathetically blinkered New Yorkers who know how to use words for everything except concern. He writes dialogue that genuinely laceratesit doesn't just lash the intended target, it lays open the speaker as well. "When you were a baby, I wouldn't let anyone else hold you," Margot coos to Claude, setting him up for the kill: "I think maybe that was a mistake." The scene in which Pauline shows Margot her (storage) room, acted by Kidman and Leigh with a seismograph's sensitivity to shifting emotional ground, sketches a lifetime of sibling rivalry in just a few surgically cutting lines, culminating in Pauline's desperate topper: "I've become a really good cook."
It gets worse, as Margot sloughs off her idealized husband (an atypically studly John Turturro ), blabbermouths a secret sure to upend Pauline's household, and voices at every opportunity how certain she is that Pauline is marrying beneath her. So why should we give a damn about a character this toxic? A solemn truth about family is that it's almost impossible to hate people we know this well. Margot, in Kidman's compellingly unlikable performance, is every relative whose motives and utterances we've picked apart on the drive home from some misbegotten holiday, blissfully unaware that she is doing the same to us.
Baumbach draws Margot, Pauline, Claude, and the surrounding characters with a wealth of novelistic detail, creating a denser, gamier, and more complex sense of family life than American movies typically dare. Sometimes, perhaps, the detail is too novelistic and schematica literal family tree with rotting roots is as metaphorically on-the-nose as the emotional Samsonite  of his collaborator Wes Anderson 's Darjeeling Limited . But the pseudo-doc immediacy of Baumbach's direction diverts us from any obviousness in the construction, wisely emphasizing the concrete over the symbolic. In this, he's helped immensely by the mottled palette and over-the-shoulder intensity of Harris Savides 's camerawork, which turns a shallow depth of field into existential near-panic.
When Squid and the Whale  came out, Baumbach was branded a whiny narcissist in some quartersa sneak thief ransacking his own broken home for self-serving materialand some critics at the Toronto film festival this year took Margot  as a scathing matricidal affront. If we insist on reading the movie as autobiography, it would seem that Margota writer who plunders her family troubles for a New Yorker  story and faces the musicis more a directorial surrogate, and the movie an act of penance. But that just reduces one of the most perceptive films of this year to inside baseball. As a stroke of luck, this blast of homecoming claustrophobia is being released for the holidays, when it may prove therapeutic. Bring the family. Or better yet, leave them.
