         New Zealand, the bawdy saying goes, is where men are men and sheep are nervous. But in Jonathan King's horror comedy "Black Sheep," it's humanity's turn to shiver and shake. Transformed by a renegade geneticist from docile balls of cotton to bloodthirsty mutants, the film's four-legged flesh-eaters  run riot over a sprawling family farm, sending its inhabitants scattering like, well, sheep.
 
 Following in the footsteps of Sam Raimi and fellow New Zealander Peter Jackson, King mixes slapstick humor with gushers of gore. Bodies are ripped to pieces, intestines pulled out, lips bitten off,  each piece of tattered flesh lovingly crafted in latex by New Zealand's Weta Workshop.
 


         






    The reliance on physical rather than digital effects may speak as much to the movie's budget as its artistic aims, but it instills "Black Sheep" with a kind of bloody nostalgia, a longing for the days when a severed head couldn't be simulated with the click of a mouse.
 
 The sheep's metamorphosis is masterminded by Dr. Rush (Tandi Wright), a typically nefarious but strangely fetching mad scientist. Tasked by the  rancher Angus Oldfield (Peter Feeney) with genetically engineering a softer, woollier breed, she's taken matters into her own hands, with predictably dangerous results. The job of halting the resultant rampage falls to Angus'  brother Henry (Nathan Meister),  who has been absent from the farm for 15 years. The reason? A crippling case of "ovinophobia," which he describes as "the completely unfounded and irrational fear that one day this was going to happen."
 
 The bad doctor has help from a pair of inept animal-rights activists, hippie-dippy Experience (Danielle Mason) and self-righteous Grant (Oliver Driver), who drops a specimen jar.  Out pops a mutated fetus that looks like a cross between "Alien's" chest-buster and Lamb Chop the sock puppet. The critter promptly makes a meal of Grant's right ear, and soon the virtuous vegan is sprouting woolly tufts and ripping the throats out of rabbits. That's right: He's a weresheep.
 
 King doesn't expect us to take any of this too seriously, but the movie is less a running gag than an ingenious prank. As if fulfilling the terms of an undisclosed bet, "Black Sheep" sets out to prove that the response to horror-film grammar is so ingrained that the right combination of signals can set our hearts racing even as our  minds giggle.
 
  The cast, including Tammy Davis as a  handyman and Glenis  Levestam as a housekeeper with a taste for innards, hits its marks flawlessly, even when the material isn't first-rate.
 
 Like "Shaun of the Dead," "Black Sheep"  is at once exhilarating and self-deprecating, knowledgeable without being fannish, clever but not too clever.

 “It’s an exciting time to be involved in agricultural science.” The achievement of “Black Sheep,” a pastoral horror-comedy from New Zealand, can be measured in its ability to make that sentence sound both sinister and hilarious. The movie is essentially a silly, grisly elaboration of a simple idea: What if sheep started running amok, feasting on human flesh and turning their victims into huge ovine zombies?  To a New Zealander like Jonathan King, who wrote and directed “Black Sheep,” the notion must be especially horrifying, since the people of that country are vastly outnumbered by  kebabs on the hoof. Turning a notoriously docile, none-too-intelligent species into a source of menace is an impressive, if improbable, feat of filmmaking.  Mr. King accomplishes it through the use of gory effects —  the exuberant grotesquerie owes a clear debt to the early work of Peter Jackson —  and through less elaborate means. A single sheep, eerily lighted and accompanied by a jolt of the right music, can be monstrous. A herd thundering over an open hillside is downright apocalyptic.  The monster sheep are the result of genetic engineering gone awry. An ambitious farmer, Angus Oldfield (Peter Feeney), has been working on a super-species, but his plans are disrupted by his estranged brother, Henry (Nathan Meister), and a pair of hapless animal-rights activists (Danielle Mason and Oliver Driver). Because of a childhood trauma Henry suffers from a paralyzing sheep phobia, which the movie does everything in its power to vindicate.  Once you have seen a sheep munching on a bloody human leg, you may think twice about your next leg of lamb. On the other hand maybe you’ll be inspired to seek vengeance. To provoke one of these responses —  vegetarianism or a defiant meat eating —  may be the point of this odd, amusing film.

Musicvid helmer Jonathan King turns New Zealand's fleecy export into mutant carnivores in endearingly amusing horror pic, "Black Sheep." With plenty of knowing winks directed at the Kiwi predilection for their ovine friends, the pic has plenty of laffs, helped along by master f/x from WETA Workshop. "Sheep," which IFC is shepherding theatrically through its First Take label, will make perfect fodder for midnight screenings on campuses nationwide, while the DVD -- released by the Weinstein Co. through Genius Products -- will yield maximum enjoyment in group viewings.
The rolling hills of rural N.Z. are the pastoral starting point as Henry (Nathan Meister) returns to the family farm looking for both a buyout from estranged older brother Angus (Peter Feeney) and an aversion therapy cure to his sheep phobia. Little does he suspect that Angus is dabbling in genetic engineering courtesy of disgraced scientist Dr. Rush (Tandi Wright).
Bubbleheaded animal rights activists Grant (Oliver Driver) and Experience (Danielle Mason) -- a mismonicker if ever there was one -- sneak onto the farm to expose the dastardly experiments. But Grant flips out and carries off a deformed sheep fetus, which he drops while escaping. One bite from the slimy creature and all Grant's vegetarian self-righteousness disappears as his woolly transformation begins.
Meanwhile, the rest of the massive flock is similarly undergoing a nefarious change. A terrified Henry, together with Experience and farmhand Tucker (Tammy Davis), try to get to the bottom of it all. But Angus is gearing up for a presentation of his new genetically engineered breed, and won't let family ties or the namby-pamby PETA wannabes stop him.
Influenced by comic horror picsfrom "Evil Dead" to homegrown fare including Peter Jackson's early work, "Black Sheep" wisely doesn't try to dress up mutton as anything other than mutton. A scene of Henry and cohorts carefully walking away from the farmhouse is obviously inspired by "The Birds," but King doesn't push the parallels and is content to keep tongue firmly in cheek, as Dr. Rush's Dr. Moreau-like experiments turn cuddly creatures into killer zombies.
Script is clever enough to keep an essentially one-note joke running throughout, and even stale moments offer groan-worthy humor ("The sheep are revolting"). Visuals are handsome, with King keen on situating the action in a typically Kiwi sylvan setting.
WETA Workshop, lauded for its work on "The Lord of the Rings," does a bang-up job with the models, and King uses a fast, shaky handheld camera when needed to cover a multitude of possible imperfections.

They're here, they're fluffy, and they're pissed. Not since 1972's Night of the Lepus , that clarion call to the clear and present danger of ill-tempered rabbits, has a monster movie palmed off a threat as counterintuitive as the woolly gut-munchers of Jonathan King 's Black Sheep . Think of this daft New Zealand  splatter comedy about mutant ewes on the warpath as Killer of Sheep II: The Revenge .
"Get ready for the Violence of the Lambs," promises the tagline, and Black Sheep  does not disappoint: In their dietary preference, King's little lambs lean more toward intestines than ivy. They're victims of genetic engineering on an isolated Kiwi farm, where ruthless Angus Oldfield  (played by Peter "Get Me a Bruce Campbell  Type!" Feeney) plans to revolutionize the livestock industry with his poppin'-fresh "Oldfields." Not even the arrival of his brother Henry (Nathan Meister ), a queasy city slicker afflicted with sheep-aphobia, halts Angus's plans to unveil the new breed before visiting globo-investors.
Greed may create the contamination, but as in 28 Days Later , it takes self-righteous green activists to loose it upon the worldin this case, a top-knotted wanker named Grant (Oliver Driver ), who swipes a fetal Sheep Zero from the farm. His "Meat Is Murder" bumper sticker doesn't deter the newborn from gnawing off his ear, leaving his accompliceearthy-crunchy Experience (Danielle Mason )to make her way across miles of suddenly hostile farmland. The fetus finds the flock, and soon their fleeces too are flecked with human flesh.
Much has been written about the resurgence of various horror genres to exorcise the world's illszombie movies acting out the threat of military occupation, torture-porn shockers that freely examine our culpability in coercion. It can't be a coincidence that monster movies such as Black Sheep , South Korea 's The Host , and Ireland 's mad-cow thriller Isolation  are making a comeback at a time of grave concern over genetic monkeying and dawning environmental catastrophe. They're the squirrelly down-low cousins of An Inconvenient Truth tagged, if you'll recall, as "the scariest movie you'll ever see" no less than Hostel Part II  is the sleazy bizarro-world kin of A Mighty Heart .
But Black Sheep , which is less accomplished than The Host  and goofier than the glum Isolation , has no high-minded pretense. It's cloned from the warped DNA of fellow New Zealander Peter Jackson 's Dead Alive , all gory hyperbole and blood-spewing sight gags. (Jackson's Weta effects outfit handled the many maulings and nifty sheep monsters, with nods to the icky transformation scenes from Joe Dante 's The Howling .) The grotesquerie of appetite ("My haggis!") sets up many of the sickest jokesas when King cuts from a scene of vegan traitor Grant chomping a cuddly bunny to the world's most viscous can of spaghetti plopping into a pot. "Have you been eating meat, Grant?" Experience accuses her beau, who's morphed into eight feet of man-hungry were-wool. "Was it even organic?"
But the main source of humor is the disconnect between the blank, impassive sheep (which bleat as if dubbed by Mercedes McCambridge ) and their murderous meanswhich are as startling to us as they are to the movie's ill-fated Sinister Scientist. (He laughs too, until two poofy marauders festoon his innards across the barnyard.) King milks his blobby forms for incongruous menace, even staging a parody of Rod Taylor 's tiptoe-through-the-toucans in Hitchcock's The Birds . And what fun's a cast of surly sheep if you can't treat them like woolly piñatas, beating them on trees, pounding their heads on steering wheels, and detonating their atomic farts with the flick of a lighter?
The cartoonish overkill that often makes Black Sheep  a hoot proves wearying over an entire movie: The broad comedy and one-note characters eventually cancel out the horror, leaving elaborate set pieces that are more frantic than funny. But writer-director King deserves credit for wringing every ounce of ovine mayhem from his sheep-for-brains premise. There is no such thing as an unfunny cutaway to a sheep.
