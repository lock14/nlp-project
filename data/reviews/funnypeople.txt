�Do you ever get tired of playing the same songs over and over again?� a young comic named Ira (Rogen) asks the singer-songwriter James Taylor, who has just watched Ira�s set. �Do you ever get tired of talking about your dick?� Taylor snips back. Apatow, of course, has built a miniempire on dick jokes, and Funny People
, the writer-director�s bid at something more grownup, just as obsessively tugs at the male genitalia for laughs. But even the raunchiest Apatow film has more than a sideline interest in relationships that go beyond the one between the cock and the balls � The 40-Year-Old Virgin
 and Knocked Up
 both had sincerely felt love stories at their cores � and in Funny People
 Apatow brings the serious stuff of mortality and human misery to the forefront. Rogen uses his Charlie Brown slouch here to good effect as Ira, a stand-up comedian struggling with the rigors of the circuit and his own crippling insecurity. Early on, Ira is hired by his comic hero, George Simmons (Sandler), as a sort of His Guy Friday, supplying jokes, fresh Diet Cokes, and moral support as George muddles his way through a leukemia diagnosis and the spiritual crisis it inspires. Rogen has limited range � his mouth tends to curl up, as if he�s ever on the verge of breaking character � and Sandler shies away from the dramatics, too, quick to go to the goofy voice or crude riposte. But Apatow has cannily built in a fail-safe: These are comedians, a wounded breed famed for its itchiness around empathy or open sentiment. They riff because that�s who they are, and it�s a more than valid entry point into Apatow�s exploration of two men tumbling toward intimacy. It�s a satisfying exit that proves more elusive. Funny People
 has a wide, unwieldy scope, and its dual narrative focus has the effect of neither feeling fully formed. There are very funny detours, surely informed by Apatow�s own time in the Hollywood trenches, the comedy circuit, the laughably disposable prime-time sitcom, and the dichotomy between comic elders and their brash successors. (A hit parade of funny people passes through the film, from an opening home video of a very young Sandler prank-calling Amex as Janeane Garofalo and Ben Stiller cackle in the background to cameo bits from Andy Dick, Sarah Silverman, and Ray Romano and larger parts from new guns Ansari and Hill.) Apatow also sets a lovely sequence in Marin County, where George goes to woo the one that got away, Laura (played by Mann, Apatow�s wife; their children also co-star). Mann, whose sharpness can be misdirected into shrill, is deeply moving as a wife and mother tempted to rearrange her life for a man who appears, in the face of death, to have rearranged his own. In this subplot, Apatow takes on complicated dynamics that are happily absent of the undercurrent of male rage that marked his earlier works (he�s also lessened his irritating tendency toward too-topical humor). He�s rewriting his own songbook here, in the key of James L. Brooks, a master at that tricky mix of humor and heartfelt. Brooks knows how to make the funny organic to the people. Apatow isn�t quite in his league yet. But Funny People
 � sensitive, shaggy, a little bit draggy � is as much about the maturation of Ira as a performer and George as a man as it is about Apatow�s maturation as an artist.

It is, I guess, an unbreakable law of show business physics that if you keep telling someone he’s a comedy genius, he’ll disavow the comedy and obsess about the genius. He’ll get serious, as if the gift of transporting audiences with laughter weren’t profound enough on its own. Down this road have gone Charlie Chaplin, Jerry Lewis, Woody Allen, Robin Williams, and many, many more, and now it’s Judd Apatow’s turn. Apatow, the director of “The 40-Year-Old Virgin’’ and writer-producer of countless bad-lad farces, may not stand with the above company, but at the moment he’s about the best we’ve got, and “Funny People’’ is his cri de coeur. Today’s lesson: Being funny isn’t any fun.

Correction: Being a world-famous, fabulously successful Hollywood comedi an is no fun. Forgive me if I have trouble whipping up the appropriate sympathy. “Funny People,’’ which is deadly earnest beneath its scum of raunchy dialogue, tells the tale of George Simmons (Adam Sandler), an A-list star of blockbuster comedies with titles like “Merman’’ and “Re-Do.’’ He lives in an empty mansion, has no friends, and is more or less a self-absorbed jerk. He has also just been informed he has a rare and probably fatal blood disease.

You’re thinking: OK, now George will spend the rest of the movie learning to hug puppies, and when he befriends one such puppy, a struggling stand-up comic named Ira Wright (Seth Rogen), the pieces of his redemption seem in place. What’s notionally good about “Funny People’’ is that Apatow knows it’s not that easy  - that Hollywood Scrooges stay Scrooged, no matter how much trendy psychobabble they talk.

What’s best about “Funny People,’’ actually, is Sandler, who takes the weird, resentful anger that has always coursed beneath his comedy and puts it right on the surface. George is genuinely unpleasant in private yet profanely hilarious in public; because he lives for the crowd, he has no interest in individuals. Sandler knows something about this, I think, and while his range as a serious actor is extremely narrow, he can cut surprisingly deep within those limits. This is his best dramatic work by far, conveying the dead-eyed piteousness of a George Simmons without begging us to like him.

The rest of the movie does that for him, or tries to. Rogen’s Ira is an unworkable paradox, a stand-up who’s also a passive-aggressive sap, and when George takes him on as an assistant  - and as the sole person who’s in on the star’s medical secret  - the gofer tries to humanize the boss. This leads to such near-sublime moments as a fit of weeping (Ira, not George) in the Palm restaurant, but Apatow, who’s back in the director’s chair with his own script, tries to cover too many bases. Ira has the full complement of nutty, trash-talking Apatovian roommates: Jonah Hill as a combustible rival stand-up; Jason Schwartzman as a preening sitcom star; the mordantly pretty Aubrey Plaza as the comedienne next door. They hit their marks and get their scabrous laughs.
In other words, the film wants to touch on human truths and still bring the funny. That can and has been done (submitted for your approval: “City Lights,’’ “Sullivan’s Travels,’’ “Annie Hall,’’ “Groundhog Day’’), but because Apatow hasn’t figured out the proper mix, he adds instead of subtracts. And adds and adds: At 146 increasingly strained minutes, “Funny People’’ is two movies, the first (and better) of which concerns George’s illness and ends at around the 90-minute mark.

The second movie is about the star’s attempts to win back the ex-flame he years ago chased away with his boorish behavior. She’s married with children now and is played by Apatow’s wife, Leslie Mann; the kids are played by his daughters, Maude and Iris. This isn’t quite as nepotistic as it seems, since Mann is a brightly sardonic comic actress and the girls make a cute vaudeville tag team, one deadpan, the other dreamy.

Yet the final hour, which takes place over a long weekend in Marin County, goes nowhere slowly. The point  - George may be cured but he’s no better  - is lost amid the unfocused farce, and it’s up to Eric Bana to walk away with the honors as the ex’s husband, a cheerfully neurotic stud. The only way to salvage this part of “Funny People’’ would have been to hack it off like a diseased limb, and I say this as someone with an unhealthy admiration for the charms of Leslie Mann.

The problem is that Apatow is stuck between gears. (That, and there’s probably no one around him to say no at this point.) Hiring the great cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (“Schindler’s List’’ and so on) means little when a director lacks a distinct visual sensibility. Trying to honestly portray the way people simultaneously need and use each other is impossible when all the characters can do is talk about each other’s testicles.

Pottymouth has served Apatow well; few recent moviemakers wield gutter-talk with such scurrilous wit. The endless groin jokes in “Funny People,’’ though, go beyond shock-comedy into pathology  - they’re the equivalent of a nervous tic. Gross-out humor is Apatow’s security blanket, and he’ll never move on until he gives up that blanket. If he can  - if he wants to  - he may yet make a real shocker: a comedy that’s both funny and rich.

The inner demons of unhappiness, anger, competitiveness, sexual insecurity, and fear that eat the soul of an outwardly successful professional comedian are of keen interest to other comedians, their mothers, their shrinks, and maybe even their mothers' shrinks. It's   the rest of us who are left out of Funny People , Judd Apatow's furiously anguished  and,  at 145 unshaped minutes, quantifiably endless  tragi-comedy about a sad showbiz clown and his ilk.
Of course, characters and dramas built around the anger that fuels the funny constitute a venerable black-humor subgenre: W.C. Fields reveled in the muck, and the jolting movies The King of Comedy  and The Entertainer  made art out of the emotional contradictions of professional comics. But Funny People  is a less successful stab at explaining jerks who make jokes. The movie, deeply personal to its maker, is too self- absorbed to convey effectively the emotional complexity that Apatow has in mind. The message that comes across is: We're all screwed, and then we die. Ba-DUM .
Adam Sandler plays George Simmons, a comedy superstar whose comfortable routines of swinging-bachelor affluence (interrupted only by high fives from adoring fans) are upended when he's diagnosed with a malignant blood disease. Not funny! There's nothing like a fatal illness to harsh a mellow, even in sunny California. And Sandler works the territory with the same fascinating intensity and daring disregard for likability he brought  to his great work in the anti-funny Punch-Drunk Love . Lonely and vulnerable, George plucks Ira (Seth Rogen), a struggling up-and-coming comic, to be his assistant. His joke writer. His paid-companion-to-sit-with-him-while-he-falls-asleep. All of the above. The ailing star also asks Ira to invite Ira's roommates and fellow comedians (Jason Schwartzman and Jonah Hill) to write material for George, too. But Ira doesn't convey that part of the news: Maybe he's annoyed because, as played by the newly trim Rogen, the character is required to endure his pals' tedious jokes about his healthy physique, as if he broke the rules of the schlub club.
Funny People  is like that: Men who are at ease with comedy and uneasy in life behave badly, selfishly, and inconsistently in sickness and in health. (Even when his prognosis brightens, George retains the symptoms of a schmuck.) But guys aren't the only losers in Apatow's cosmos. As Laura, the love of George's life who left  him years ago to marry a better, nonshowbiz type (a funny, feisty, hotcha  Eric Bana   good for Laura!) and raise an adorable family, Leslie Mann dutifully represents all women who have ever loved a charming, unreliable guy and given up while waiting for him to ripen. Laura is a thankless role to play  she's her own kind of flighty cuckoo  but at least she's allowed to be a married adult.  The only other female of any consequence is Daisy (newcomer Aubrey Plaza), a deadpan girl comic in the mordant Janeane Garofalo mode. In a twisted take on postfeminism, Daisy stands by her right to sleep with famous men simply because they're famous.
To promote Funny People , Universal is pushing the angle that Apatow, who wrote and directed The 40 Year-Old Virgin  and Knocked Up , is one of today's most pop-culturally attuned dramatists, specializing in the funny anxieties of talkative boy-men. (Said anxieties include sex, women, commitment, adulthood, regular working hours, and societally mandated norms of hygiene.) The come-on is that the movie assembles a great party of popular actors who have become famous by associating with Apatow  among them Rogen, Mann, and Hill  and then raises the stakes: Look, it's Sandler, grand master of a parallel school of boy-man comedy, in the lifelike leading role of a rich and famous star! For a kick, other famous comedians (e.g., Paul Reiser, Sarah Silverman, Ray Romano) and one famous rap musician from Detroit (Eminem) appear as themselves.
But the stars twinkle like distractions. And in his long, sobering story without a punchline, Judd Apatow confounds three crowds: traditional Sandler fans expecting goofy sweetness, Virgin /Knocked Up  boosters hoping for raunchy fun, and connoisseurs of movies, however offbeat, that know (as professional funny people say) how to kill. C–


 Comedy is always serious business, whether the joke is on the funnyman with the  pie in the kisser or the woman trying, really  trying,  to fall for the  schnook who didn’t use the condom. “Funny People,” the latest from Judd Apatow, the  director  of the hit comedies “Knocked Up” and “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” and  a prolific producer,   is being pitched as a bid at gravity, earnestness, adulthood, whatever. It’s  an angle that sounds as if it had been cooked up by a studio flack to explain how words like divorce and death got tangled in with all the penis (and thereabouts) jokes. But the only difference is that now  Mr. Apatow  also seems lethally serious about  being Judd Apatow.  “Funny People,” which he wrote and directed, stars Adam Sandler as George Simmons, a onetime stand-up nobody who has become fantastically successful by starring in the kind of crummy high-concept Hollywood comedies — in one, he plays an adult with the body of a baby — that have been the creative ruin of Eddie Murphy.  Shortly after the movie opens, George learns that he has a rare, almost certainly fatal blood disease. Shaken up,  he returns home and watches images of himself on five television screens  in his mansion, a nice touch for any professional narcissist. He also pursues an experimental treatment and hires an assistant, a fledgling Los Angeles stand-up, Ira (Seth Rogen).  The first section  of “Funny People” buzzes along on George and Ira’s relationship and the modestly comic, often unsettling give and take between the famous and the not famous, which in Hollywood terms means the powerful and the weak. Ira is flattered by the attention, but he’s hungry too. He wants a piece of the other man’s show-business action,  which,  as is evident in one pathetic scene of two hot numbers turned on by George’s fame, is the only action he has hopes of getting.  Neutered in spirit, he might not service his boss sexually, like those two eager stargazers — I have a boyfriend, one woman announces to Ira, right before heading off with George — but he nonetheless assumes the assistant’s requisite submissive position.  Mr. Rogen, who has blown up professionally and slimmed down physically since his breakout role in “Knocked Up” two years ago, makes a cute puppy. He tags after George, loyally wagging his tail and begging for scraps, which is what he receives. When he writes jokes for George’s appearance at a MySpace corporate event, he earns  $1,000 as his headlining boss pockets the $299,000 balance. Like the backstage scenes of stand-up comics anxiously swapping phony compliments and phonier insults, the MySpace scene conveys the surreality of the celebrity circuit in which name personalities are trotted out for pricey dog and pony entertainment. (MySpace sponsored a contest where the prize was a walk-on role in the movie.)  The stand-up scenes, with their bad lighting and air of flop-sweat, have the sting of truth. But they are also disappointingly brief, while the onstage routines, with the exception of one of Ira’s bits about being a polite womanizer, are neither especially funny nor memorable. The deep rituals of the comedy circuit aren’t really the point here, as becomes clear as Mr. Apatow forges into increasingly sticky territory, lavishing time on George’s contrition tour as he unconvincingly mends fences with his estranged family and socializes with equal opportunity comedy offenders like Sarah Silverman and Norm Macdonald. (Eminem, as himself, trumps those jokers by threatening to beat up the real Ray Romano.) Then George reaches out to an old lover, the laughs give way to tears and this promising comedy bloats, sags and dies.  That rekindled flame, Laura, is played by Mr. Apatow’s wife, Leslie Mann, a brittle, lightweight comic talent who giggles and flutters right on cue, widening her eyes at George with obligatory adoration. She’s fine, but the gushy romance she brings with her is a drag. As is true of almost all the female characters in Mr. Apatow’s movies, Laura’s role is to help George grow up, to get out of both his own head and insular masculine world. Yet while this dynamic worked in “The 40-Year-Old Virgin” and to a lesser extent in “Knocked Up,” in this movie the romantic complications are primarily situational: she’s married.  Honor, rather than George’s ego (it isn’t in remission) stands in their way, which gives him  — and Mr. Apatow  — an easy out.  That’s too bad because while Mr. Sandler doesn’t have the necessary acting technique  or even the natural warmth to convince you that his character cares about anyone else, he is undeniably a star, the movie’s biggest draw and its most effective and powerful presence. It’s easy to buy him as both a selfish jerk and a maudlin self-pitier, whether George is weeping alone into his designer sheets or confiding some  medical news to his housekeeper, the only sympathetic ear around. With his flatline  drone, stand-and-deliver gestural performance and prickliness, Mr. Sandler is effortlessly charmless, and in his performance you see the  risky movie this might have been if Mr. Apatow had pushed harder.  There’s something irritatingly self-satisfied about “Funny People,” which explains why, though it glances on the perils of fame, it mostly affirms its pleasures. Part of this stems from the autobiographical touches. George doesn’t double for Mr. Apatow, though  the filmmaker’s  sympathies keep the character on the safe side. But this is Mr. Apatow’s world, his friends, his wife. His and Ms. Mann’s daughters even play Laura’s children. If the fear of death haunts George only  briefly it isn’t only  because his disease  goes on hiatus,  it’s also because Mr. Apatow  seems to have become uncomfortable with or perhaps immune to the messiness of life. This, he seems   to be saying, is as good as it gets, and man, is it ever good. He’s sentimentalized himself.  That’s nice, I suppose, but nice can be murder on comedy and drama alike. (Comedy is a man in trouble, not a man at peace with himself.) It’s telling that when Mr. Apatow isn’t trying to get in touch with George’s (gentler, kinder) feelings, the movie pleasurably pops. The scenes, for instance, of Ira and his greedily ambitious friends, the globular Leo (Jonah Hill) and ramrod-straight Mark (Jason Schwartzman), who together form a walking, talking exclamation point, have a lightness of touch and palpable warmth. They’re also seamlessly, easily comic because of the push-pull between the friends’ ambition and camaraderie, their hopes for one another and their competitive ruthlessness.  Watching “Funny People,” you get the sense that Mr. Apatow, one of the most successful filmmakers working in Hollywood, is very happy. Bummer.  “Funny People” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Candid but long-winded, well observed but undisciplined, "Funny People" feels like Judd Apatow's diploma picture marking his move from high school to college as a filmmaker. Amusing and engaging yet lacking in snap and cohesion, this insider's look at the world of standup comics in contempo Los Angeles rings true in its view of the variously warped, stunted and narrow lives of its mostly male denizens. Adam Sandler's central performance as some version of himself is notable for its revelation of callowness and ambivalent self-regard, which will fascinate some fans and turn off others. Curiosity should spur a healthy opening, with likely widely divergent reactions suggesting questionable staying power.
Although Apatow's name seems to have been on the majority of the comedies made in the past four years, Universal is pushing the auteur angle by stressing that this is just his third film as a director. After the raunchy antics of "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and "Knocked Up," he's gone half-serious here, serving up Sandler's fictional equivalent, George Simmons, as a 40ish comic superstar who learns he has a rare and possibly fatal disease.
This seems like a setup for a tiresomely typical Hollywood story in which a self-absorbed celebrity learns through crisis that there's more to life than fame and success. To the contrary; Apatow's handling of the illness issue is one of the best things about the picture, in that it's underplayed, entirely unsentimental and quite blunt in answering a central question: If George were to get a miraculous medical reprieve, would he continue being an arrogant a-hole? Maybe.
"Funny People" is about individuals -- mostly young, physically unprepossessing, Jewish, horndoggy guys -- who try to make a living being funny. The film is outstanding at observing the interplay and competitiveness among three roommates: Leo (Jonah Hill), a tubby and belligerent performer and writer; Mark (Jason Schwartzman), the painfully self-serious star of a lame TV comedy; and Ira (a now entirely slimmed-down Seth Rogen), an aspiring standup whose life and career take major turns when he starts writing material for George.
Like their mostly below-the-belt stage monologues, the guys' conversation is largely rude and crude. Ira, who takes no end of abuse from George about the fact that he changed his last name from Weiner, never gets anyone in the sack and becomes irate when an offbeat scenester girl he likes, Daisy (Aubrey Plaza), casually gets it on with Mark.
George lives in an extraordinary mansion above the Pacific and invites Ira into his life up to a point. Frank about the perks of stardom where women are concerned, he is similarly blunt about other aspects of his life. "I used to be excited," he confesses, a mountain of unread scripts piled on his countertop, later adding that someone like him has plenty of people to hang out with but no real friends.
The picture bobs along very nicely for 85 minutes or so, engaging smiles and interest with its behind-the-scenes looks at the comedy club culture, the bull sessions that produce new material, the way comics test themselves and each other, their sensitivities and jealousies. When George gets some unexpectedly positive medical news, he celebrates with pals at the Palm, occasioning some amusing cameos from Paul Reiser, Sarah Silverman, Ray Romano and Eminem, among others.
But there's still nearly an hour to go, most of which leaves the L.A. comedy scene behind in favor of the Marin County manse of George's old flame Laura (Leslie Mann), a former starlet now married with two daughters. In San Francisco for a shared gig with Ira, George allows what was intended as a social call to develop into something more and ultimately becomes embroiled not only with Laura's daughters (Apatow and Mann's very cute own sprigs, Maude and Iris) but with her volatile Australian husband, Clarke (Eric Bana).
While it has its moments, this long latter stretch drains the picture of what little momentum it had and switches the focus to Laura and her own marital problems, which are annoying and not entirely convincing. Beset with persistent disappointment over a thwarted career while living in paradise with lovely kids and a hunky, if errant, mate, she's just not an interesting or even very tolerable character, her behavior stemming entirely from confusion, panic and emotional impulse. Mann hits all the surface notes, but never reveals anything beneath the manic surface.
While the film ends up as a grab bag of impressions rather than a fully realized work, there's plenty to savor, beginning with Sandler's performance. Pic opens with some homemade videos Apatow took of his former roommate making prank calls when they were both aspiring unknowns, and samplings of Sandler's subsequent early standup work and parodies of the star's lowbrow comedies both honor and poke fun at the performer's achievements. But the many insights into everything from the man's arrogance to his self-derision make you feel you're getting something real here, and Sandler's gruff, offhand manner combines with his comic alertness to very good effect.
Playing a frustrated fellow who never knows if his boss is going to praise him or bite his head off, Rogen makes for a fine foil in a performance that, like most of the film, avoids easy shtick. The comic thesps are completely at home in the milieu, while the generally hidden Australian in Bana is exuberantly unleashed here.
No doubt hired to provide upgraded visuals for a director not heretofore known for pictorial niceties, Janusz Kaminski serves up crisp, brightly colored images quite unlike those he usually produces for Steven Spielberg. Soundtrack is dominated by loads of carefully chosen pop tunes.

After devoting his first two films as director, The 40-Year-Old Virgin  and Knocked Up , to getting laid and having kids, respectively, Judd Apatow  brings the circle of life to a close with Funny People , which stars Adam Sandler  as George Simmons, a popular, Sandler-esque movie star diagnosed with a rare and potentially fatal form of leukemia. When actors and directors start thinking outside of themselves and start worrying about how to get more respect or be taken capital-s seriously, it's almost always a recipe for disaster. Mercifully, Funny People  is probably the least bathetic, self-pitying movie about death and dying to come out of Hollywood  since Albert Brooks 's Defending Your Life . When he receives his diagnosis, George doesn't sit around feeling sorry for himself, or set out on some inspirational quest to do everything he ever wanted to do before he dies, or any of the other things people in movies tend to do in these situations. Instead, like probably most of the people you and I know who have faced similar bad news, he resolves to fight this thing the best he can and get on with the business of living.
That's not to say that George doesn't go through his share of denial, anger, bargaining, and depression en route to accepting his condition. There's a great, discomfiting scene early on—one that begs to be pushed even further—in which he lapses into a dark, stream-of-consciousness riff during a stand-up set at the famous Comedy & Magic Club in Hermosa Beach , leaving the audience uncertain about whether or not they should laugh. After George implodes, a twentysomething actor and comic named Ira Wright (Seth Rogen ) takes the stage and makes light of George's gloom, winning laughs for doing so. Later, when the comics meet up in the parking lot, George tells Ira he would have done the same thing when he was his age, and eventually asks him to come write jokes for him.
So the world of the dying comedy legend intersects with that of the hungry up-and-comers—not just Ira, but his roommates, Leo (Jonah Hill ), another aspiring actor-writer, and Mark (Jason Schwartzman ), a hilariously pompous pretty-boy actor who has recently landed the lead in a not-very-good high school sitcom. Apatow clearly knows a lot about the competitiveness and petty rivalries of showbiz people desperate to get their foot in the door, and the Hollywood scenes in Funny People  remind you how soft and self-congratulatory the ones are in most other movies. Ira, whom Rogen plays as a dithering mixture of Sancho Panza  and a nervous Jewish mother, realizes that George is his big break, and Apatow shows us his willingness to exploit his close proximity to a famous person—dying or not—for all it's worth. And there are other things Apatow observes so well, yet so indirectly, that you wonder if people who haven't lived in L.A. and known people like these characters will fully appreciate them.
In fact, there's so much that's so disarmingly good and sharp about Funny People  that you wish the whole movie weren't so much of a shambles. I've seen the film twice, and both times, exactly halfway into its two-and-a-half-hour running time, I have felt the cabin shudder and noticed tiny fissures forming in the fuselage. That's at the point in the movie when George goes in for a checkup and learns that the experimental drugs he has been taking seem to be working, and that he may no longer be dying after all. "Get back to your life," the doctor intones, and the rest of Funny People  is about George's dawning realization that he doesn't much like the life he had before, socializing with celebrity pseudo-friends (cue raft of cameos from Sarah Silverman , Eminem , et al.) and perambulating his giant, Xanadu-like mansion, surrounded by mountains of useless swag. So he decides to reconnect with his ex-girlfriend, Laura (Leslie Mann , the real-life Mrs. Apatow), whom he cheated on 12 years earlier and who now has a new life with a businessman husband (Eric Bana ) and two young daughters (played by Apatow's own kids, Maude and Iris).
It's hard enough for a movie to withstand the introduction of a whole set of major characters past the point when most movies are wrapping things up, and it's even harder when those characters feel so incongruous to everything that has come before. On one hand, Laura and her brood should  seem incongruous to George and his solitary life, but the feeling is one of unintentional mismatch. When George and Laura have their first big scene together, it doesn't feel like these two people have a whole shared history together, and this is even less apparent in Mann's scenes with Bana. Apatow has been accused of not writing good parts for women—unfairly, I think, because Catherine Keener 's in The 40-Year-Old Virgin  was that rare smart and sexy role for a woman over 40 in a major Hollywood movie. But here, the accusation sticks: Laura's inner life hasn't been thought out nearly as well as that of George, Ira, and all the other guy parts, and the character ultimately becomes a cog in a series of third-act plot machinations that betray the organic feel of the earlier scenes.
