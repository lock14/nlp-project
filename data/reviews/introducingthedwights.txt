         Jeanie DWIGHT (Brenda Blethyn) works as a short-order cook in a Sydney cafeteria, but she used to be a comedy star and wishes she still was. Everything that's funny and sad about "Introducing the Dwights," an appealing Australian comedy tinged with melancholy, springs from this simple fact. Jeanie may be a working-class single mother in her 50s, but her gargantuan need for attention gives her a mythical dimension. She's like Echidna, the mother of all monsters — half nymph, half snake. (Emotionally speaking, of course.)
 
 Jeanie lives in a modest house in a working-class neighborhood of Sydney with her two sons, Mark (Richard Wilson), who suffers from a mental disability but knows his way around a bon mot, and Tim (Khan Chittenden), an exceptionally handsome but painfully introverted 20-year-old virgin. Jeanie is intent on reclaiming her former glory, now 25 years gone and all but forgotten, and Tim serves as her chauffeur, moral support and official joke tester while making payments on a moving truck to set himself up in business.
 


         






   When Tim meets a beautiful girl named Jill (Emma Booth) during a moving job and falls in love, Jeanie feels so threatened by the relationship that it takes her to the edge of a nervous breakdown. On her way there, she refuses to remember Jill's name, guilt-trips Tim mercilessly over an uneaten ratatouille the first time he spends the night at Jill's  house and bullies him into getting on stage with her during a benefit performance so that she can humiliate him in front of his girlfriend.
 
 Lest this description make the film sound "Mommie  Dearest" Down Under, however, Jeanie's narcissism has a flip side — she's funny, lively and fiercely devoted to her sons. Blethyn glides between moments of fun and warm conviviality to Jeanie's more exotic emotional states as effortlessly as if she were mixing a cocktail. Screenwriter Keith Thompson based the story on his experiences growing up as the child of entertainers, and his script conjures the experience with tenderness, humor and compassion.
 
 For a quirky Australian indie comedy, the quirk in "Introducing the Dwights" is kept  refreshingly in check. These are fully realized characters, not caricatures. This goes even for Tim and Mark's father, John (Frankie J. Holden), a one-hit wonder country musician in Johnny Cash drag who works as a  security guard but is trying to make a comeback. Director Cherie Nowlan  likes her characters, and she gets them — which is no small thing considering what she's dealing with.
 
  Wilson is very good as Mark, if (through no fault of his own) a little confusing. For a kid who was deprived oxygen to the brain, he's wittier  than Noel Coward on his third martini. In fact, until the condition is explained, you assume something like high-functioning autism, or cerebral palsy. More believable is Nowlan's portrait of Tim and Jill's barely post-teenage love, which is treated so naturalistically it takes you back. Jill is a font of sudden freak-outs, rages and tears; Tim is a bewildered mute incapable of providing even the simplest explanations that would definitely allay the sudden freak-outs, rages and tears — and still the whole thing manages to look incredibly appealing and giddy.
 
 The stakes are purely emotional, and yet they feel very high.
 
 But the movie belongs to Blethyn, who takes a difficult, easily misunderstood role and gracefully cracks it open to reveal what's inside. The single false note in "Introducing the Dwights" comes at the very end, during an all-is-well epilogue that feels tacked-on and possibly mandated. But considering what Jeanie's been through, you don't begrudge her her moment of happiness.

 “Introducing the Dwights,” directed by Cherie Nowlan from a script by Keith Thompson, is a funny-sad, icky-sweet comedy of family dysfunction  — a genre that seems to flourish in Australia, this film’s country of origin. The monstrous, needy matriarch of the Dwight clan, Jean, may be British, but she has assimilated, however miserably, into a familiar lower-middle-class Down Under milieu of dreamers and eccentrics.  Jean was once a semifamous nightclub comedian, and she fans the sputtering flame of her career at C-list nightclubs, where she is introduced as “clubland’s raunchiest homemaker” and tells broad, bad jokes about the uselessness of men. (“Having sex with a big bloke is like having a wardrobe fall on you in the middle of the night,” she observes.)  There is nothing particularly subtle about Jean’s material, but then again, she is played by Brenda Blethyn, a woman who can overact brushing her teeth or frying an egg, and who conveys her character’s emotional state by mugging, winking and occasionally shrieking. You know, early on, that Jean’s volatility is heading for a Big Scene, and it arrives punctually in the last act, a scheduled train wreck complete with booze, loud music and wanton blubbering.  After which everything is more or less O.K. And “Introducing the Dwights,” in spite of Ms. Blethyn’s excesses, is also more or less O.K. Her absences come as a relief to the audience, much as Jean’s do to her younger son, Tim (Khan Chittenden).  He and his older brother, Mark (Richard Wilson), who has a disability resulting from brain damage suffered at birth, live with their mom and cater to her fragile, voracious ego. (Dad, a country crooner played by Frankie J. Holden, makes ends meet working as a supermarket security guard.) When Tim, who has a one-man moving company, meets Jill (Emma Booth), Jean’s fierce jealousy is activated, and she embarks on a campaign of bullying, guilt-tripping and spiteful manipulation.  It takes Jill awhile to understand that Jean is the source of her new boyfriend’s skittishness, and she at first mistakes his sexual timidity for lack of desire. Ms. Booth and Mr. Chittenden are both attractive young actors with a knack for easygoing understatement, and the best parts of “Introducing the Dwights” observe the flowering of their tentative, tender relationship. When Jean enters the picture, though, the melodramatic volume is cranked to a level beyond what the movie’s modest scale can sustain.  Her narcissistic awfulness does increase your sympathy for Tim and Mark — how could it not? — but it also makes the cute, sentimental aspects of the story seem forced and implausible. The film seems pulled between conflicting impulses — toward a dimension of psychological gothic almost worthy of Tennessee Williams and toward a tidy, quirky sitcom — and the filmmakers can’t find a tone that would manage both.  “Introducing the Dwights” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sex, nudity and language.

Aussie "Clubland" is a dysfunctional family dramedy in which the kids' coming-of-age steps are those away from parents with problems of their own. TV-dominated resumes of helmer Cherie Nowlan (whose one prior feature a decade ago is early Cate Blanchett starrer "Thank God He Met Lizzie") and scenarist Keith Thompson are reflected in the conventional filmic style, smoothly engineered narrative and overly neat wrapup. Still, "Clubland" is warm and entertaining enough, with Brenda Blethyn doing a variation on her "Little Voice" vulgarian amid appealing support perfs. Warner Independent joined the club last week, plunking down $4 million for North American, U.K. and German rights.
Blethyn's character here isn't quite in the monster-mother league of her "Voice" one, but she will more than do. 
Jean Dwight (Blethyn) is a middle aged mother of two grown sons who was once a rising star in her native England. Her marriage to one-hit-wonder country singer John (Frankie J. Holden) and relocation to Sydney saw her career fortunes more or less evaporate.
These days she's divorced and working a day shift at a cafeteria, but she still lives for the few gigs she gets as a stand-up comedienne cracking wise a la Phyllis Diller about oafish husbands, bad sex, that time of the month, etc. (Frankly, her routine is so awful it strains credibility that she'd get any work at all.)
On the home front, she depends heavily on 20-year-old offspring Tim (Khan Chittenden) to schlep her around and shoulder much of the responsibility for minding brother Mark (Richard Wilson), a spastic who was brain-damaged at birth (though his dialogue is awfully precocious). 
Given mom's rather overwhelming personality, it's no surprise Tim is shy. When he meets flirtatious young roommates Jill (Emma Booth) and Kelly (Katie Wall), the second girl encourages the first to give him their number. 
Jill's a willowy blonde beauty and he's an adorable young hunk, so why not? Problems arise, however, when Jill's neediness clashes against Tim's inarticulate nature -- she mistakes his virginal skittishness for rejection.
Once they've worked that out, there's a more formidable obstacle: Mom. With a starry benefit and a big audition coming up, the generally well-intentioned but hopelessly self-centered Jean is more demanding than ever. She resents the time Tim spends with Jill. 
Various complications and a climactic meltdown presage a feelgood ending that shamelessly yanks viewers' chains harder than necessary. 
Still, progress is quite pleasant, balancing comedy and drama to solid if familiar effect. Against Blethyn's star turn, Chittenden more than holds his own, subtly making the withdrawn Tim quite endearing. Supporting perfs are largely brassy and all quite likeable. Package is pro in all respects, though there's nothing going on here that would suffer in translation to the small screen.

Brenda Blethyn 's trademark histrionicsmaternal blubbering and drama-queen shrillnessworked smashingly for her intentionally trying role in Secrets & Lies , but her central performance in Introducing the Dwights  sees these traits amped to a rather squirmy 11. Misleadingly (if more interestingly) titled Clubland  when it screened at this year's Sundance, director Cherie Nowlan 's patchy Australian dramedy stars Blethyn as divorcée Jean, a once-famous bawdy comedienne who can't accept that she's past her prime. Oblivious to how her egomaniacal control issues are cock-blocking both of her sons, Jean is primarily stressing out strapping, 20-year-old mama's boy Tim (Khan Chittenden ), whose fear of losing his virginity to insecure but totally horny Jill (Emma Booth ) takes an unintentionally Oedipal bent whenever he runs home to support his mother's Benny Hill esque act instead. Other son Mark (Richard Wilson ) is slightly brain-damaged and dubiously written as the idiot-savant butt of many a gentle joke, which might have worked had the actor been more convincing (his girlfriend is played by a mentally retarded actress; why wasn't he?). With its broad, toothless humor and ham-fisted fits of melodrama, this sitcom-grade embarrassment aims to dethrone Muriel's Wedding  as the quirky Aussie feel-gooder of all time, except it hurts too much to watch.
