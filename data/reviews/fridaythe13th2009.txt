In the tradition of � and with apologies to � longtime Austin Chronicle
 Friday the 13th
 franchise reviewer Steve Davis (whose whereabouts are currently unknown, following his courageous decision to finally track down and interview the fabled Wild Man of Borneo some time back), I humbly offer up this tribute to the Cramps' late, great frontman, Lux Interior, in lieu of a proper review. Because, frankly, and with all due respect to series creator Sean S. Cunningham, Kane Hodder (former Jason), and all the girls who faced off against Our Man in the Hockey Mask and won their freedom (or lost their minds, heads, or maidenheads) over the past three decades, this filmed-in-Austin Friday the 13th
 made my tummy hurt so bad I needed a gallon of bop juice and a new kind of kick just to purge the bland and uninspired goo-goo muck the Nispel and Michael Bay alliance has foisted on a new generation of gore-hounds. To the tune of the Cramps' "The Most Exalted Potentate of Love": "Here comes the madman you've been dreaming of; he's the most exalted potentate of blood; he's got a hockey mask that fits like a glove; he'll be coming �round the lake to gut your love; he's the most exalted potentate of blood. He's the most celebrated horror hound around, a momma's boy who'll put you 6 feet down; he makes Madman Marz look like Johnny Guitar; he's good with a bow, and he dies real slow; he's the most exalted potentate of blood. But bad, this film's so bad! To flub the fans' most beloved butcher boy. Bad, this film's so bad! It's Bay and Nispel who oughta be destroyed. �Cause it's Jason Voorhees wrote this book o' death, as he killed and died and then took another breath; but Platinum Dunes ain't Crystal Lake, and everything here is an utter fake, a dullsville yawnfest, a crummy Bay mistake. Mad, this makes me mad. He was the most exalted potentate of blood."

'Friday the 13th" as restaged for 2009 connects to this time and place only tangentially. The kids play beer pong. They go speed-boating. They wear "Star Wars" T-shirts, giant cargo shorts, and flip-flops, and go foraging for weed. They still urinate alone in the forest and have loud sex in a tent. If they know they're a cliche, they're helpless to stop acting like one. But we know, which makes it hard to freak out over their safety.
Our future victims do seem to know the myth of Crystal Lake, where in 1980 the mother of a boy who drowned massacres a group of camp counselors. In countless subsequent sequels, the son would become immortalized as Jason Voorhees, the serial killer in a goalie's mask who by the time of 1989's "Jason Takes Manhattan," had devolved into a summer-camp camp star.
Still, these new kids are obliged to endanger themselves for us. But when a 6-foot-5, 260-pound machete-wielding man can get close enough to breathe on you, it's more hilarious than terrifying. 
Everyone's hearing appears to have vanished along with their cellphone reception. If Jason could talk, his one line would be: "Can you hear me now?"
The most interesting innovation in this new "Friday the 13th" is the possibility that the slasher film could pass for a reality-television show. Through reductive editing, generic people become interchangeable types without ever approaching actual personhood. It's "The Hills," "Bromance," "The Real World," and "Rock of Love" with a body count. Indeed, "Friday the 13th" gives us two seasons of this show. Once Jason hacks his way through one group of stupid, horny, good-looking kids, he gets a fresh batch a scene later  - this time with two tokens of color and a moody white hero looking for the sister who vanished in batch one. (The camera enjoys lingering on the vein in his biceps as much it does all the jiggling C-cups.)
The movie might have worked if it winked more  - or if it played things completely straight. Director Marcus Nispel also coughed up a 2003 version of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" that seemed to miss what was so frightening about the original of that film, too: an atmosphere of pervasive dread. For all the amateurishness of the original "Friday the 13th," there was also more than a little psycho-social subtext. It was the rare slasher film where a woman, deranged as she was, slayed for a reason. She was a reverse Norman Bates  - mother killing for son.
Some recent filmmakers have gamely outfitted their movies with topical girding that gives the mayhem and gruesomeness somewhere to go and someplace you'd want to follow. "28 Days Later" and its sequel, "The Signal," "The Descent," even the appalling "Frontier(s)" are recent examples of horror that had a scrap of wit and ambition. The films respected their genre even as they challenged its limits.
All Nispel does is repackage what's been hot recently in horror. The slayings here are indistinguishable from the atrocities of "Saw" and "Hostel." His psychological scars lasered away, Jason now kills for sport. Like the filmmakers, our bogeyman is merely a copycat hack. And for those of you watching the box office, he continues to serve a far grimmer end: He's still just an ATM.

Ice hockey's angriest goalkeeper Jason Voorhees returns in this new version of the slasher classic from director Marcus Nispel and producer Michael Bay, the pair responsible for 2003's remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre . Friday the 13th  shares a grungy, competent vibe with that previous effort as Derek Mears' Jason sets about dispatching the large number of folks who make the mistake of smoking marijuana or flashing their mammaries in the vicinity of Camp Crystal Lake. True, the characters often act in unbelievable and downright suicidal ways. ''Where's he going?'' ponders Jared Padelecki upon first espying a corpse-carrying Mr. Voorhees. (Really, that's  the question? Not: ''How the blue blazes do we get out of here?''). However, this film is (be)head and shoulders above the recently reanimated likes of Prom Night  and My Bloody Valentine .

 There’s a refreshing lack of numbers in the title of “Friday the 13th,” the latest in a slasher-flick franchise that has spawned approximately 500 sequels, including one that sent its villain, a hockey-mask-wearing psycho named Jason, into outer space to terrorize nubile astronauts.  Neither is it a remake of the 1980 original, which is just as well, since even that dubious classic is a lousy movie. Directed by Marcus Nispel, who gave us a monstrously cynical remake of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre” a few years back, “Friday the 13th” attempts to shake off a quarter-century of Jason-related silliness (“Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan”). Set in the present-day, with a story line that references the original’s mythology, this movie attempts to reboot the concept, if that’s the word, of this undying series.  The surprise is that it does so with vicious aplomb, massacring its generic clutch of topless young girls and their inebriated boyfriends, assembled at a lavish summer house around the way from Camp Crystal Lake, with a gleeful sense of fun.  Fun? Granted, most people’s notion of entertainment doesn’t involve watching sexed-up, beer-guzzling morons impaled, decapitated or burnt alive. But there’s an itch for this kind of material, and here it is scratched — to the bone.  “Friday the 13th” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for some very, very nasty things.

The body count continues, as will other grosses, in "Friday the 13th," a by-the-numbers remake of the crudely elemental slasher whose '80s and '90s sequels made a half-billion-dollar killing for Paramount worldwide. Resurrected by "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" revampers Michael Bay and director Marcus Nispel, hockey-mask-sporting, mother-grieving psycho Jason Voorhees here butchers not one but two batches of nubile young things who unwittingly share his stomping grounds at Camp Crystal Lake, aka Camp Blood. While it won't scare up "Chainsaw" figures, "13th" will be a lucky number for Warners domestically and somewhat less so for Paramount, relegated to international rollout.
Sick as it sounds, the pic's word-of-mouth success will pivot on the creativity of the murders -- which are aptly repugnant if nowhere near ingenious, particularly not by "Saw" standards. To say the new film is better shot and cut than those barebones gorefests of the Reagan era is to say nothing much, as even series fans would agree, and Nispel's movie is only marginally clever in its relation to producer-director Sean S. Cunningham's 1980 "original" (itself a rip-off of "Halloween").
Pic opens in that year, on June 13 (a Tuesday, but whatever), with sweet young Whitney (Amanda Righetti) decapitating Mrs. Voorhees, who had slain camp counselors she believed responsible for the drowning death of her son Jason (Derek Mears) -- still alive, as it turns out. Thus, the bulk of the pic (whose title appears more than 20 minutes in) covers the basic territory of 1981's "Friday the 13th, Part 2," wherein the deformed Jason takes his own revenge on Mommy's killer and other sexy college-age kids like her.
These include a half-dozen sex- and pot-loving campers at Crystal Lake and Whitney's chopper-riding brother Clay ("Supernatural" hunk Jared Padalecki), who goes looking for his sis and eventually finds her, held captive, in Jason's absurdly elaborate underground tunnel lair.
After several murders on the property, expertly handled with bow and arrow, bear trap, hatchet and machete, Jason gets inside the cabin and goes to work on eliminating the remaining survivors. The killings are not all instantaneous as before, befitting the torture-porn genre in which victims are made to suffer.
As in his "Chainsaw" remake, Nispel's scare tactics amount to little more than carefully timed cattle-prod shocks, aided by high-volume speaker blasts that were beyond the budgetary reach of the early '80s films.
Shot in and around Austin, Texas, the pic peaks early with a waterskiing interlude gone bad, as Nispel, along with d.p. Daniel C. Pearl and editor Ken Blackwell, appear psyched to invoke the horror of other franchise pics, namely "Jaws" and its first sequel. Pastiche-laden screenplay by "Freddy vs. Jason" scribes Damian Shannon and Mark Swift includes, of all things, a marijuana-laced homage to Lauren Bacall's "Put your lips together" line from Howard Hawks' "To Have and Have Not." Sadly, "Friday" series in-jokes are few and far between, though roads to future sequels are surely paved.
Aesthetically, Nispel's "Friday" is slightly stronger than his mediocre "Chainsaw," if essentially identical. Pearl's widescreen lensing appears professional but woefully lacking in nuance and detail -- which, given the flatness of the first "Friday's," may in fact be one of the more faithful elements of the adaptation.
Standouts in the young cast include Danielle Panabaker, who has the fresh-faced appeal of the young Winona Ryder, and Aaron Yoo, who lends much-needed comic flair to the part of a playfully goofy, Cheech-esque stoner.
Harry Manfredini's original "ch-ch/pa-pa" theme is used here, but sparingly, perhaps in acknowledgment that the murders are telegraphed plenty well enough as is. Steve Jablonsky's score also is quicker than Manfredini's, in keeping with the killer's curiously aerobic agility.


As resistant to new ideas as crabgrass is to Weed-B-Gon, the Friday the 13th  movies have weathered 3-D, sci-fi, CGI, multiple revivals and finales, and even a battle-of-the-mothballed-bogeymen grudge match against Freddy Krueger , without deviating from their dull stalk-'n'-slash formula. Entering its 30th year (see: cinema, decline of), the idiot offspring of Halloween  and Mario Bavas Twitch of the Death Nerve  rebootswhich means the first few minutes restage the originals climax, followed by a modern-day teaser that grinds up some expendable nobodies . . . and thats before the title, dude! After that, the movie proper offers more of the same. This means that for one ticket price, you get three shoddy Friday the 13th  movies packed into one, which might constitute entertainment value if any one of them constituted entertainment. Fanboys will resent director Marcus I Fucked Up The Texas Chainsaw Massacre  Remake Nispels perfunctory ax/machete/bear trap money shots: Deaths are plentiful, but kinda blahhardly comparable to Tom Savini s groundbreaking gore effects in the 1980 original. (Chekhov was right: A woodchipper in the first act will fire up in the third.) Of special note (besides the movies boob quotient and weirdly insistent anti-pot subtext) is Arlen Escarpeta  in the ever-popular role of the Black Guy Whos Toast. It falls to Escarpeta to confront the hockey-masked, machete-wielding madman with the most ineffectual weapon in slasher-movie historywhich prompted the woman behind me to mutter, Aw, man, dont drop that wok.
