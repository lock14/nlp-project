I'm all for civilized moviegoing. But the only way to survive "88 Minutes," the new Al Pacino serial-killer thriller, aside from skipping it altogether, might be to use it as a drinking game. Whenever a woman's corpse is shown hanging from a pulley, or the movie throws in one of its gratuitous flashbacks, or somebody mentions that Pacino's character is a top forensic psychiatrist - have a sip of Fanta. Sugar shock shouldn't be too far behind.
Pacino's Dr. Jack Gramm gets a call saying he has less than 90 minutes until he's killed. Years ago, his testimony helped put the call's prime suspect (Neal McDonough) on death row. So who now could be out to get both him and the random women he knows? One of his grad students (Alicia Witt, Benjamin McKenzie, Leelee Sobieski)? His assistant (Amy Brenneman)? The psych department's dean (Deborah Kara Unger)? Me? This is one of those movies in which everybody's a suspect.
The illogical script by Gary Scott Thompson is desperate to keep us guessing but clueless as to how. Every tin of red herring in the store gets ripped open. In one scene, Pacino runs into all three of his students on different levels of the same parking lot, where the mysterious motorcycle man who's been cruising him for hours also happens to be.
It doesn't take long for the cop-thriller cliches to kick in. Dr. Gramm's gruff detective buddy (William Forsythe) tells him, "It's no secret you're a womanizer, that you drink. You're over the edge!"
It's unclear how much of Pacino's performance Forsythe has caught up to that point. I've seen Pacino over the edge. This is not it. He looks pooped and pickled. Maybe being the only thing standing between a megaplex opening and a trip straight to the $4.99 bin at Target wiped him out. Director Jon Avnet ("Fried Green Tomatoes") sends the camera spinning around his star, maybe hoping to whip him into a frenzy, but he's got no "hoo-aah" left. Pacino seems like he's even seen the movie's ridiculous finale before. Which if he's ever watched a single cheap, trashy thriller from the 1990s, he has. When the actor tells someone, "That's my job, to be convincing," I giggled. This seems true only if Pacino wants to convince us that he'd rather be anywhere but "88 Minutes." In which case, I'll sip to that.


It takes eight minutes, tops, to know that even by the conventionally lax standards of watch-and-toss serial-killer movies, 88 Minutes  is a stinker, the more so for the thespian excesses of the accomplished cast. And stinkiest of all is Al Pacino, who drags his younger troops (among them Leelee Sobieski, Amy Brenneman, Alicia Witt, and The O.C. 's Benjamin McKenzie) down with him as he hams from the tips of his aerated, feathered hairdo to the stubs of his smeary goatee. Pacino plays forensic psychiatrist Dr. Jack Gramm, whose life is threatened by a caller using a Scary Movie  voice disguise. The calls appear to be related to the impending execution of a vengeful, icy smoothie (Neal McDonough) convicted of multiple murders based on the shrink's testimony.
Guilty in the first degree of robotic dialogue (the screenplay is by Gary Scott Thompson) and graceless direction (the credit goes to Jon Avnet), 88 Minutes  features cell phones that ring in ridiculous situations and menace that lurks unimaginatively in parking garages and stairwells. That still leaves time for repeated, sadistic viewings of women strung up and sliced with fetishistic complexity of procedure. And for no good reason and every bad one, a character is pointedly self-described in the beginning as a lesbian  for the sole purpose of allowing her sexuality to compromise her professionalism late in the interminable countdown.

 The execrable “88 Minutes” has many of the main ingredients for a camp lollapalooza, notably one of those unfortunate Al Pacino star turns that make you wonder if a career intervention is even possible at this stage. Certainly his startling appearance — a dusky orange tan that suggests a charbroiled George Hamilton and an elevated pouf of hair that appears to have been engineered to put Mr. Pacino within vertical range of his female co-stars — suggests a level of vanity that might make an intervention difficult. Vanity is a star’s prerogative, but it can be the portal to inescapable self-parody, as the late-period Joan Crawford attests.  Although it’s often laugh-out-loud laughably bad, “88 Minutes” is mostly just a slog. The subject doesn’t help: it opens with an intricately choreographed murder that finds a young Seattle woman trussed up like a hog for slaughter. Cut to the present. The murderer has been caught, and the man who helped put the villain on death row is Dr. Jack Gramm (Mr. Pacino), a forensic psychiatrist and professor with young Amazon students (Alicia Witt and Leelee Sobieski) and a sympathetic foil with a badge (William Forsythe). Dr. Jack fields lots of calls from his assistant (Amy Brenneman), but one day he receives a ring-a-ding from someone who says that he has 88 minutes to live ... then 82 minutes ... and so on.  Movies that make a ticking clock part of the story run the risk that viewers may start checking their watches, and so it is with this one, which seems to slow down the longer it goes, largely because it runs an interminable 105 minutes and not a tantalizing 88. During what’s meant to be a short time, the plot complications amass, as do incoherent camera setups and yet more elaborately trussed-up female bodies. A few outré touches help pass the tick-tock, tick-tock, including the dissonant casting of the spectral Deborah Kara Unger as a college dean and the production design for Dr. Jack’s digs, a Sharper Image bachelor pad with a wine collection and a Walther pistol, a brand favored by James Bond.  Outside of Ms. Unger, who delivers one of her singular and eminently watchable narcoleptic turns (and seems to have actually done a little of her own stunt work), the performances are risible. The usually appealing Ms. Witt and Ms. Sobieski fare less well than Ms. Unger does, largely because one is forced to vamp Dr. Jack while the other assumes a naughtier role, and in leather pants, no less. Mr. Pacino, who spends much of his screen time talking and occasionally shouting into a cellphone, barely seems to register that he’s sharing the screen with any other actors, perhaps because in a very fundamental way he isn’t. There’s nothing to be said about Jon Avnet’s direction except that he sure does like aerial shots.  In fact, there’s nothing at all left to be said about this idiotic flick. But here’s a thought: Misogyny aside, the attention shown to the display of dead bodies in “88 Minutes” offers continued evidence that cinema’s fascination with human locomotion during the art’s first 50 years — evident in early motion studies, in the gymnastics of the silent-movie clowns and in musicals — seems to have been supplanted in the last 50 by a fascination with rigor mortis. The touchstone for this shift is probably Hitchcock’s masterpiece “Psycho,” in which the camera is more vibrantly alive than any of the characters, including that dead blonde in the shower. She makes such a beautiful corpse it’s no wonder that we keep asking for more.  “88 Minutes” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Murder, torture, naked women — the usual.

"88 Minutes" can't even live up to its title. With 19 -- count 'em, 19 -- producers, including director Jon Avnet, ensuring that every aspect of the film, from the script to the star's haircut, is ludicrous in the extreme, the picture easily snatches from "Revolution" the prize as Al Pacino's career worst. Available on DVD in some territories as early as February 2007 and rolled out theatrically in France and elsewhere beginning in May of last year, this gape-inducing fiasco is getting a token domestic release that at least saves its star the indignity of a dump straight to homevid.
But from the incompetently staged first scene, in which nubile Asian twins are strung up and tortured by a weirdo to the accompaniment of generic musical pummeling, this looks like something off the bargain horror rack. Nine years later, "Seattle Slayer" Jon Forster (Neal McDonough) is skedded to be executed for the crime, but on that very day, a virtually identical murder is committed that could be the work of a copycat, but might also call Forster's guilt into question.
Enter Dr. Jack Gramm (Pacino), a star forensic psychiatrist whose testimony landed Forster on death row. The operative word here is "star"; this guy has a goofy thatched haircut that by definition cost hundreds of dollars, a seeming perma-tan, a top-of-the-line Porsche and a high-tech designer condo that may rep the combined fantasies of the 19 producers.
Jack also teaches at a local university where all his female students are babes, at least some of whom have crushes on him even though he's past retirement age. In the interest of fair play, his male students are good-looking too, but in that cold, potential-serial-killer sort of way. Oh yeah, the dean of the law school (Deborah Kara Unger) is a babe, too.
Not bad, either, is Jack's loyal assistant Shelly (Amy Brenneman), who's probably in love with her boss but is a lesbian, a detail that comes dubiously into play later on. More important, however, is Shelly's function as a plot device; after Jack is informed by a mysterious caller that he will die in 88 minutes because of his role in determining Forster's fate, it's Shelly who's on the cell phone relaying information and making contacts while Jack goes about his daily business.
If Avnet and screenwriter Gary Scott Thompson (the first two "The Fast and the Furious" features, "Hollow Man," "K-9") had gone into lockdown mode at this point and adhered to a rigorous real-time format, perhaps they could have recouped some ground. But they couldn't care less, as Jack moves hither and yon around town in ways that would take hours, makes dozens of calls (a good half the film's dialogue is cell-phone conversation) and deals with an FBI man (William Forsythe) who suspects Jack committed the most recent murder. One particularly babelicious student, Kim (Alicia Witt), tags along on his quest but, scarcely a half-hour before Jack is supposed to die, takes time out to ask why he never got married and if he still wants kids.
Finale looks more like a Cirque de Soleil routine than a realistic to-the-death faceoff, but then, if viewers aren't laughing by this point, it means they've already walked out.
Pacino rants and runs around, but without quite the sense of urgency one might imagine from someone in his extreme predicament. To play the babes, the 19 producers have seen fit to hire actresses (including Witt but especially Leelee Sobieski) with the uniform capacity to tower over the leading man, something for which he was surely grateful.

Jon Avnet 's cheesy new thriller, 88 Minutes , is 105 minutes long, and going in, I feared that 100 of them would be eaten up by Al Pacino  chewing the furniture. Alas, it's worse than that. Pacino plays a Seattle forensic psychiatrist in symbiotic thrall to the serial killer he helped put away nine years ago, and though his hair looks like Mount St. Helens  preparing to blow, he's going for the other self-parodying bit of business that continues to foul up his legacy—world-weary, heavy-lidded sighing ennui, as befits a fallen hero oppressed by his past, barely functioning in the present, and careless of his future.
But for a man who's all but given up on life, Jack Gramm  sure keeps busy. While profiling serial killers for the FBI  and the local police, he hectors a college class, in which sharp-witted nymphs are disproportionately represented, twists the night away with strange women half his age (though naturally: "I never sleep with my students"), and keeps tabs on the killer, Jon Forster  (a suitably cyborgian Neal McDonough ), who, on the eve of his execution, mounts a high-tech publicity campaign against his nemesis.
Talk shows mutter of procedural irregularity, cars go up in flames, and generic voices whisper "Tick-tock" into Gramm's cell phone while counting down the minutes to his demise, timed to coincide with Forster's. Dark secrets flow out of Gramm's past in perfect parallel with the blood that pours out of the lovely young female victims of the copycat killer who bedevils his case against Forster. If Gary Scott Thompson 's laughably expository screenplay and Pacino's eye-rolling weren't enough to flag Gramm's blooming paranoia, a thumping score gilds the lily, along with endless cutaways to pretty faces frozen in attitudes of studied ambiguity.
With Forster safely behind bars, someone is setting Gramm up, and almost everywhere we look, suspicion falls on firm young female flesh that's barely over the age of consent. Could it be the surviving twin (Tammy Hui ) of the gruesome murder that put Forster away, who comes bearing cookies to celebrate his pending death? A go-getting graduate student (Leelee Sobieski ) with unusually advanced knowledge of legal-defense arguments? Gramm's teaching assistant (Alicia Witt ), who shows her devotion to the life of the mind by removing her top in the professor's sleek pad? The dean of students (Deborah Kara Unger ), a blonde looker at least a decade younger than anyone working her way up the college-administrative ladder could possibly be? Or could the perp be Gramm's faithful lesbian assistant (Amy Brenneman ), who is, not insignificantly, the only woman he can bring himself to kiss on the lips? And as if poor Jack didn't have enough on his plate, lissome young corpses pop up at gruesomely regular intervals, drugged, trussed, and hung upside down as they bleed to death.
With its lumbering efforts at black humor and phony pretense to moral complexity, 88 Minutes  is an ugly specimen on just about every front, and I've half a mind to spill the beans on how this disreputable excuse for a thriller ends—not that there's much reason to care.
There is one way, however, in which, all unawares, the movie works like a charm—as a twisted, self-torturing essay on the aging man's fear of and desire for the young female body. We may have to sit through worse films to come this year, but with any luck, there'll be none as guilelessly, idiotically misogynist as this one.
