‘Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen’’ is  - there’s no polite way to say this  - 2 1/2 hours of tumescence disguised as a motion picture. Giant robots smash each other to rivets, Shanghai and the Egyptian pyramids are reduced to rubble, fighter jets scream across the sky, bombs burst in air, and Megan Fox’s measurements are deployed on the screen for maximum effect.
Admit it: Your inner teenage boy went into a blissful coma just reading that sentence.
You don’t have an inner teenage boy? Sorry, you’re out of luck. The sequel to the 2007 summer hit “Transformers’’  - based on the Hasbro
 line of snap-together battle-bots and thus the ultimate toyification of American cinema  - offers nothing for mature adult sensibilities. On the contrary, it laughs at the very idea and then blows more stuff up. Fast, deafening, and dumb, the movie is total nonsense and will make a fortune. But it’s a Michael Bay project, and the man does have the lack of shame to go with his deficiency in basic storytelling skills.
Shia LaBeouf returns as Sam Witwicky, the teenage hero  - now bound for college  - who’s the human emissary between the Autobots (good) and Decepticons (evil), alien mecha-thingies who’ve made Earth their last-stand battleground. This being a sequel, the villainous Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving) isn’t quite dead yet and the core group of Autobots led by Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) is filled out by various clanking newcomers. (If you’re a fan, you already know who’s here; if not, it’s not worth the bother.) Megatron’s boss, a sort of silver-plated Lucifer figure called The Fallen (Tony Todd), has aims on Sam’s brain, which has become imprinted with ancient runes leading to a doomsday device. But, silly me, I’m talking about the plot, which is the least of the movie’s concerns.
This being a sequel, the running time is also padded with comedy. Sam’s dumb-cluck parents (Kevin Dunn and the unstoppable Julie White) get a lot more screentime, as does the intense government nerd played by John Turturro, who knows a good franchise when he lands in one. Some of the laughs are genuine, although a little of Ramon Rodriguez as Sam’s fraidy-cat roommate goes a long way.
Some of the new ’bots are fairly clever, too: an old codger (Turturro again), a sassy little Brooklynite voiced by Tom Kenny. They’re dopey enough to drive the fanboys nuts  - oh, the disrespect  - but they do liven up the show. Still, what are we to make of Mudflap and Skids (both Kenny), a pair of shuck-and-jive Autobots who talk in ridiculous gangsta-speak. The insultingly unfunny comic relief of “Transformers,’’ they’re Jar Jar Binks times two and the first known example of robot blackface.
Technically, of course, the movie represents state-of-the-art CGI overkill, with metallic behemoths that roar and unpack themselves and leap tall buildings and are forever smashing the masonry. They’re visually astonishing and ultimately exhausting. All Bay knows is the action that never stops, the detonations that reach orgasmically ever higher, the chase scenes that build and crash and build some more.
So what if he can’t put a coherent series of shots together? Bay’s going for pure sensation, and everyone knows dramatic continuity is for women and the weak. “Revenge of the Fallen’’ is the kind of movie that puts the Rockies in New Jersey, that appears to send the heroes into the Smithsonian from Washington, D.C., and back out into the Southwestern desert, and if you want to complain, text someone who cares.
Anyway, the director would rather let his camera caress Fox as Sam’s bodacious grease-monkey girlfriend, the kind of woman who can keep her lip gloss fresh in the midst of global apocalypse. Bay knows she’s a critical part of the fantasy, just as Isabel Lucas as a college co-ed with a Freudian nightmare of a tongue is part of his audience’s primal anxieties. “Revenge of the Fallen’’ could use some time on the couch: one character tasers himself in the testicles and the Constructicon called Devastator is startlingly well-equipped. Bay may be the face of the new blockbuster fascism, but he and his constituency might want to work out the kinks before they dominate the planet.

In Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen , a Decepticon  one of those evil robots that looks like a junk heap of pewter shards designed by H.R. Giger  floats around in space, where it sends a ball of fire rocketing to Earth. The asteroid-like object hits the ocean, where it emerges as a prancing metallic cougar, which then vomits out a mass of ball bearings, which somehow assemble themselves into a super-thin droid that's like a Calder sculpture made entirely of jackknives. And it's this  dude who gets down to business, attempting to steal the shard that will animate the dormant Decepticons hidden on Earth. The sheer velocity of all this shape-shifting is dizzying and funny and zigzag cool. The sequence serves no real purpose beyond dazzle for dazzle's sake, but when you're watching it, that's purpose enough. Revenge of the Fallen  has a number of dead spots, but every time the movie hits one, you can sit back in eager, childish anticipation of the next feat of industrial whirligig diversion.
When I was growing up, no movie could take me out of this world quite like a giant-monster movie. Them!  and The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms  , Godzilla   and his Japanese rubber-gigantor brethren: Even flickering from the confines of a small-screen TV, these creature features delivered a blast of apocalyptic awe that made their utter ricketiness as movies forgivable, at times endearing. I got a twinge of nostalgia for those days watching Revenge of the Fallen , in which the Decepticons resume their war against the Autobots, those friendly converted vehicles who wear their machine guts on the outside. The movie is sort of like the super-size, metal-on-metal version of an old nuclear-mutant monster battle.
Directed by Michael Bay , and co-executive produced by Steven Spielberg , Revenge of the Fallen  is slovenly, bombastic, overly busy, and  at two hours and 29 minutes  far too long. The plot, which sends Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf ) to his freshman year at a debauched East Coast college and then to the ruins of Egypt, suggests an awkward smelting of Bret Easton Ellis and Indiana Jones; it offers more frantic incident than it does purpose or sense. Yet each time the film reaches another clash of the titans, it becomes more than just a souped-up toy commercial. These toys have wizardry and grandeur. And in the case of Optimus Prime, the noble Autobot who converts into his nuts-and-bolts self out of a truck with a nifty orange-flame insignia, they also have a glimmer of soul.
Shia LaBeouf seems to get taller and leaner, more confidently chiseled, with each new movie. But he'll always have his precocious kid's quick-start mind, and in Revenge of the Fallen , he uses it to play off on-screen girlfriend Megan Fox , with her porno-doll sultriness, as if they were in a romantic comedy. She's like Angelina Jolie before Jolie got too serious to be irresponsibly sexy, and Revenge of the Fallen  needs their jovial, flirtatious chemistry; the movie would be too much of a juvenile boys' bash without it. At college, Sam, having touched one of those otherworldly shards, finds himself possessed by a series of ancient symbols, and though this development is just a thin rehash of Richard Dreyfuss' possession in Close Encounters of the Third Kind  , LaBeouf, talking a mile a minute, does something witty: He literally makes you feel that his brain is working too fast for his mouth. I liked the hurtling speed of these scenes  Ramon Rodriguez, from The Wire  , brings his own motormouth brio to the role of Sam's master-of-the-Internet roommate  but Bay, unfortunately, can't sustain it. Whenever the U.S. military comes into the picture, the movie stiffens and lumbers, and the return of John Turturro  as Sector 7 Agent Simmons is one babbling, pop-eyed tech freak too many.
At last year's Comic-Con convention, several representatives of Revenge of the Fallen  appeared with the slogan ''Bigger. F---ing. Robots.'' on their T-shirts, and Bay, taking that cue, knows just what his job is relative to the first Transformers   (2007): It's to make the movie huger, louder, smashier, and  on the mechanical level  more crazily, audaciously imaginative. He succeeds. Revenge of the Fallen  showcases an infectiously diverse brigade of chattery unfolding contraptions, from mechanical gremlins that transform out of kitchen appliances to one that erupts from a vintage airplane to a coed with a tongue of steel. Each of these creature-gizmos has a marvelous, organic fluidity  they don't just move, they clank and roll. And it was an inspired touch to set the film's most ferocious battle amid the Pyramids, featuring a Decepticon so humungous it just about waddles with power. Revenge of the Fallen  may be a massive overdose of popcorn greased with motor oil. But it knows how to feed your inner 10-year-old's appetite for destruction.

 The creative people behind the cretinous “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,” the second blockbuster inspired by the popular Hasbro toys, have segmented their demographic into four discrete categories:  1. Young teenage boys who still play with Transformer toys (or keep them under the bed).  2. Older teenage boys who identify with the professional  doofus Shia LaBeouf.  3. Somewhat older teenage boys who would like to play with the professional hottie Megan Fox.  4. Boys of all ages who think it would be cool to go to war and run around the desert shooting guns.  Of course, viewers can embrace several categories at once; say, those who collect toys and liked Mr. LaBeouf in the last “Indiana Jones” movie. Or those who fantasize about having sex with Ms. Fox while shooting guns, a vision that distills the auteurist ambitions and popular appeal of the movie’s director, Michael Bay.  And make no mistake: Mr. Bay is an auteur. His signature adorns every image in his movies, as conspicuously as that of Lars von Trier, and every single one is inscribed with a specific worldview and moral sensibility. Mr. Bay’s subject — overwhelming violent conquest — is as blatant and consistent as his cluttered mise-en-scène. His images, particularly during the frequent action sequences, can be difficult to visually track, but they are also consistently disjointed. (And proudly self-referential: the only director he overtly cites is himself, with a shot of the poster for his movie “Bad Boys II.”) The French filmmaker Jacques Rivette once described an auteur as someone who speaks in the first person. Mr. Bay prefers to shout.  The shouting here commences just as Sam Witwicky (Mr. LaBeouf) heads off to college having ridden shotgun on a battle royal between extraterrestrials in the first flick. While fighting over the fate of the planet, the heroic Autobots and the villainous Decepticons hang out on Earth disguised as machines with cute nicknames, mostly fast cars, big rigs and military planes. The Autobot leader, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen), usually rolls as a Peterbilt truck tricked out with shiny chrome and red painted flames, while the car parked in Sam’s family garage, a screaming if now voiceless yellow 2010 Camaro, goes by Bumblebee. Every so often, the aliens convert to their true shapes, their articulated parts opening up like metallic origami.  Given Mr. Bay’s predilection for action over introspection, it’s no surprise that he plucks Sam out of school right after he cracks his first textbook. Along with his unlikely girlfriend, Mikaela (Ms. Fox), Sam heads off to an adventure that reunites him with many of the first movie’s characters, including an embarrassing John Turturro as Simmons, who provides some wincingly unfunny comic relief, and some military beefcake in the hardbody forms of Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson. Also back, if not for long, are the Autobots Ratchet (a Hummer H2) and Ironhide (a GMC TopKick pickup), which have suffered a fate more terminal, at least to the brand, than any meted out by the Decepticons: General Motors has sold Hummer and discontinued the TopKick.  There’s a serious disconnect in the movie between the image of power that those GM brands are meant to convey and the bankrupt car industry they now signify. That disconnect only deepens with the introduction of two new Autobot characters, the illiterate, bickering twins Skids (Tom Kenny) and Mudflap (Reno Wilson), both of which take the shape of Chevrolet concept cars. The characters have been given conspicuously cartoonish, so-called black voices that indicate that minstrelsy remains as much in fashion in Hollywood as when, well, Jar Jar Binks was set loose by George Lucas. For what it’s worth, the script, by Ehren Kruger, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, also includes a crack about Simmons, who’s coded as Jewish, and his “pubic-fro head.”  You’re not meant to take that seriously, of course, just like there’s nothing to the reference to President Obama being whisked out of danger instead of standing tall like Optimus Prime and the rest of the robotic heroes. But that’s the perverse genius of Michael Bay. Despite the tediousness of his stories and inanity of his visual ideas, he always manages to keep you laughing and shaking your head in disbelief at the outlandishness of his cinematic spectacles, with their orange explosions, armament fetishism and even their noxious stereotypes. The man just wears you out and wears you down, so much so that it’s easy to pretend that you’re not ingesting 2 hours and 30 minutes of warmongering along with all that dumb fun.    “Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Bloodless violence.

With machines that are impressively more lifelike, and characters that are more and more like machines, "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen" takes the franchise to a vastly superior level of artificial intelligence. As for human intelligence, it's primarily at the service of an enhanced arsenal of special effects, which helmer Michael Bay deploys like a general launching his very own shock-and-awe campaign on the senses. Otherwise, little seems new compared to the first installment, except that this version is longer, louder, and perhaps "more than your eye can meet" in one sitting. It will reap similar B.O. rewards worldwide.
Kicking off where the initial entry ended, part two of an eventual trilogy continues to carry Hasbro's toys and cartoons of the '80s to the heights of 21st-century CGI and moviemaking technology. Focusing even more on what auds seemed to appreciate last time around -- that is, the stupefying sight of colossal alien robots morphing quite realistically into earthly contraptions, and vice versa -- the plot serves as merely a pretext to showcase lots of well-designed creations, which run the gamut from a remote-control toy car to an actual Stealth fighter.
After a prologue set in 17,000 B.C., we once again team up with U.S. Army grunts Capt. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and Sgt. Epps (Tyrese Gibson), now members of an elite squad called NEST, which uses humans and Autobots to hunt down rogue Decepticons across the globe. Hoping to free their leader, Megatron (voiced by Hugo Weaving), who was previously imprisoned at the bottom of the ocean (why he wasn't melted down into scrap metal is a question only franchises can answer), the baddies are hoping to uncover the remaining shards of the powerful cube ("the Spark") that was destroyed at the end of the first pic.
As was the case before, nerd-cum-hero/heartthrob Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) happens to hold the key to the Decepticons' shot at world domination. Only this time, he's left both his goofy parents (Kevin Dunn, Julie White) and hot mechanic g.f. (Megan Fox) behind for a college whose students all look like twentysomething actors, and whose frat parties seem to take place at expensive strip clubs. In fact, on his first night out, Sam is treated to a sort of lap dance by a Decepticon posing as a nymphomaniacal freshman -- one of several more overtly sexual nods in this episode (including a shot of John Turturro in a G-string).
Cutting schematically between the military's efforts to thwart the Decepticons and Sam's prophesying tics (scribbling foreign symbols, speaking in tongues) provoked by the Spark, the opening hour culminates in a massive, forest-set battle that leaves the Autobots' leader, Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen), ripe for the junkyard.
Like the other extensive combat scenes -- including a closing, all-out war that appears to take place in the same desert location as in the first movie -- the sheer amount of ripping steel, exploding mechanical parts and mutating vehicles of all shapes and sizes is something to behold. Industrial Light & Magic's superb handling of these sequences, which are like a little boy's playtime fantasy taken to Wagnerian proportions, are the veritable centerpieces of a narrative that makes little effort to set up the fights.
The effects are captured in varying earth tones by d.p. Ben Seresin ("Best Laid Plans"), who does a terrific job matching the CG and live-action sequences, while delving into Bay's usual combo of a few slow-motion dramatic moments and lots of widescreen, airborne pandemonium. Likewise, a new team of editors pieces everything together seamlessly.
A few surprises arrive in the second half -- involving bigger, deadlier pieces of metal, including a character, the Fallen (Tony Todd), that gives the pic its title -- when the action heads to Egypt and Jordan. But returning scribes Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman -- joined this time by Ehren Kruger ("The Ring," "The Brothers Grimm") -- seem to be mining conventional motifs from "The Mummy" and "Indiana Jones" series.
Although the writers propose a similar dose of tongue-in-cheek dialogue for Sam, his parents and his techie roommate (played by Ramon Rodriguez of "The Wire"), the actors often have to shout it over constant music or thunderous bursts of crunching hardware. LaBeouf has a few strong moments during the college-set scenes, and Turturro -- whose character has been demoted from a government agent to a butcher in a Brooklyn deli -- once again offers some much-needed zaniness in the heavy later stages.
But the true stars here are the Transformers themselves, who continually steal the spotlight from the flesh-and-blood cast, even in scenes of tragic death or comic relief usually reserved for real actors.
"If God made us in his image, then who made him
?" Sgt. Epps wonders early on, gazing with awe at Optimus Prime. If such a question seems to be hinting at a veritable Autobot creation myth, it may explain why humans here have become backseat drivers to these extremely cool cars.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen  is a bewildering, noisy, sloppy, cynical piece of work, a movie that sneers at the audience for 147 minutes and expects us to lap it up as entertainment—and be grateful. This is blockbuster porn absent even the suggestion of care or concern for anything that might resemble "a point," save the obvious one to move more Hasbro  action figures and animated-series DVD boxed sets. In a word: distasteful. And if the above resonates with anger . . . no, not at all—only the extreme annoyance born of absolute disappointment.
Plot? There's a plot? You don't say! Directed by Michael Bay  and co-written by the men responsible for Star Trek , ROTF  is rumored to have something to do with a matrix keymajiggy that unlocks the sun-killing whoziwhatsis and the never-ending smash-up derby pitting Autobot against Decepticon. You may recall that its 2007 predecessor was a mostly capable commercial for Transformers toys and Bay's previous films, from which most of the iconography was lifted as the man continues to pay homage to his favorite filmmaker. (Has he ever made a movie without the image of fluttering American flags?) Transformers  was actually Bay at his most surprisingly reflective and unexpectedly restrained—the domestic scenes involving Sam Witwicky  (Shia LaBeouf ) and his parents (Kevin Dunn  and Julie White ) felt particularly sincere—and also his most ingenious, as he merged man and machine in beautifully choreographed fight sequences and literally has us wondering, "How'd he do  that?"
Well, he's done it again—it, and nothing more—and so the trick no longer dazzles. Which isn't to suggest that Bay's not entirely into it—there are scant moments when he seems to be paying attention, such as a sequence during which a resurrected Megatron  (hoo-boy) kidnaps Sam and fills the kid's orifices with insect-like Decepticons who slither around his innards for a look-see. Bay's in touch with his inner Cronenberg during this lone, profoundly isolated moment, the one scene during which you can actually tell what's happening—and to whom, because he lets the gross-out speak for itself.
But why speak when you can SCREAM for almost two and a half hours? Why go subtle when there's shit to blow up? Which is most of the problem: It's astonishing how exhilaration can give way to boredom in movies starring special effects. Even the leading man is annoyed: Where Sam spent the first film as a wide-eyed reluctant hero charged with saving the world with his yellow Camaro  and weirdly too-hot girlfriend (Megan Fox , the sole survivor of the real Cybertron), here he's just bothered by the whole scenario (and that's well before the creepies crawl under his skin). The Autobots are now working for the government, rooting out Decepticons around the world (psst, one's doing heavy labor in Shanghai ), and Sam just wants to go away to college—where, of course, he's saddled with an aggressively annoying roommate (Ramon Rodriguez ) who accompanies LaBeouf and Fox for the for the rest of the movie, joy. But a respite's not to be—not when the Fallen's gotten back up after a 19,000-year rest somewhere in orbit around the earth, which he's looking to destroy, just because he can. Kind of like Michael Bay.
