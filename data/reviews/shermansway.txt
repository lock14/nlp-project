 Like an annoying new puppy, “Sherman’s Way” just wants to run around in circles and lick your face. After a while, though — and against your better judgment — you kind of fall in love with it.  Not that either of this movie’s lead characters, an elitist Yalie and a washed-up Olympian, is particularly admirable. As Sherman, a recent law school graduate and uptight mama’s boy, Michael Shulman embodies the kind of preppy privilege that’s a liability almost anywhere but Manhattan. But it’s James Le Gros,  playing a disgruntled former ski champion named Palmer, who finally pulls you in: his shaggy charm cushions both Sherman’s neuroses and the script’s manipulations.  The pair meet when Sherman, stranded in California after an impetuous decision goes awry, needs a ride to an internship in Beverly Hills. Enter Palmer with a stolen MGB roadster, a carpe diem mentality and a character arc as visible as his immaturity.  Nevertheless the director, Craig Saavedra, generates surprising warmth from the familiar tropes of the odd-couple road movie.  Shooting mostly in the verdant sweep of California’s wine country — and with a superb supporting cast — he allows Mr. Le Gros room to engage. Palmer may be an emotional infant but he can lick my face any time.

An agreeable tone and cast make �Sherman�s Way� go down easy. Still, nothing strays far from odd-couple formulaics as an uptight Ivy Leaguer gets psychic bolts loosened by road-tripping with a genial bum (a Kevin Costner-ish role played with relish by James LeGros). Pleasant little indie, which shared Cinequest�s audience award with �The Village Barbershop,� probably lacks the distinctiveness and star power to tempt much theatrical-distrib interest, but is likeable and polished enough for exposure in smallscreen formats.
Short-leashed by his hard-driving Manhattan lawyer/politico mum and told he lacks spontaneity by his girlfriend, Sherman (Michael Shulman) rebels by bolting to the latter�s Napa Valley home for the summer. Unfortunately, he arrives just in time to witness her reunion with a hunky local b.f. Leaving in a snit, and still trying to prove he can be impulsive, he hitches a ride with the next car that goes by. It happens to be a vintage cherry-red convertible driven -- and possibly stolen -- by ex-Olympic skier Palmer (LeGros), Sherman�s ne�er-do-well opposite. Amiable, well-crafted if unoriginal comedy features Enrico Colantoni as Palmer�s laid-back bud and Brooke Nevin as Sherman�s new quirky-girl romantic interest.

Director Craig Saavedra  and writer Tom Nance 's collaboration plays like something out of an indie-film paint-by-numbers. Take a richie-rich, straight-laced stuffed-shirt (Michael Shulman  as set-for-life college student Sherman ), stick him in a beat-up roadster heading cross-country that's piloted by a wacky wash-up (James LeGros  as forgotten Winter Olympian Palmer "The Bomber"), toss in a few eccentrics and hotties-to-trot along the way, and, voila, off to the film festival circuit we shall go in search of shallow-end enlightenment. The acting doesn't help—just how many cue cards were used in this production, anyhow? And, though no fault of its own, the film now feels like a rinky-dink redo of HBO 's new Eastbound & Down  series, starring Danny McBride  in more or less the same role as LeGros—the former star athlete who thinks he's big shit but is nothing more than a dumb shit on his way to the footnotes.
