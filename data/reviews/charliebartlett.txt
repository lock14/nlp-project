If the fictional characters Ferris Bueller (during his �day off�) and Max Fischer (the would-be Rushmore
 alum) joined together and had a child, their spawn would most certainly turn out something like this movie�s titular character, Charlie Bartlett (Yelchin). This new, R-rated teen comedy would very much like to become the emblematic high school movie of its time, and its stellar cast and topical storyline about overprescribed pharmaceuticals help kick Charlie Bartlett
 toward the vicinity of its goal line. But the soft and derivative script by newcomer Gustin Nash and the lax direction by editor-turned-first-time-director Poll lend the film about as much kick as a placebo. The story is set into motion as rich kid Charlie is kicked out of his final private school (this time for manufacturing fake IDs) and his loving but narcotized mother (Davis) sends him to a public high school. Even though adults advise him that there�s more to high school than being well-liked, Charlie desperately wants to fit in and carve out his own little domain. When he realizes that he can dole out to his classmates the Ritalin and other drugs that the psychiatrist (whom his family keeps on retainer) prescribes for him, Charlie discovers the makings of a whole new status-creating enterprise. Soon he has set up office in the school restroom to dole out pills and common-sense psychological wisdom to his grateful classmates, using the bathroom stalls like mock confessional booths. A budding romance with the principal�s rebellious daughter, Susan (Dennings), puts Charlie in the crosshairs of principal Gardner (Downey Jr.), a self-medicating alcoholic who would like to go back to being a simple history teacher instead of the school�s chief disciplinarian. Although Charlie does achieve popularity, events occur midway through the film that cause the teen to renounce his drug dealing, at which point the film becomes a hodgepodge of standard high school situations and a push toward Charlie�s resolution of his absent-dad issues. As Charlie, Yelchin (Alpha Dogs
) almost sells the movie by the sheer virtue of his dynamic performance. The young actor announces his talent with the same kind of �here I am� nonchalance that was displayed by Matthew Broderick in Ferris Bueller�s Day Off
 and Jason Schwartzman in Rushmore
. When Yelchin shares scenes with a powerhouse like Downey Jr. (who gets the biggest meta-laugh of the movie when he declares in his stupor, �Never attack a drunk guy with a gun�), the screen is barely able to contain the two. Sequences like the silly montage of Charlie on Ritalin (which just looks like the precious doodles of a former editor), grievously underdeveloped characters, and heavy heapings of sap instead of snark keep Charlie Bartlett
 from making the dean�s list.


It takes a minute for "Charlie Bartlett" to distinguish itself from the movies and books it appears to be ripping off. But once it does, the movie transforms into an exuberant, unexpectedly smart comedy about the fraught give-and-take between kids and grown-ups. The title hero (Anton Yelchin) is a preppie who, having been evicted from yet another Connecticut boarding academy for assorted scams, shows up at a public school in a blue blazer desperate for the student body to love him. His mother (Hope Davis) is an over-medicated lush who's happy he's back in the mansion.
The movie smells like "Catcher in the Rye" and some of its loose offspring, like "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," and, in particular, "Rushmore," especially after we find out the public-school principal (Robert Downey Jr.) is a self-loathing drunk who likes to wallow by his swimming pool the way Bill Murray did in "Rushmore." But Charlie isn't cynical or acutely arch. The movie seems allergic to phoniness. And Downey, who's shrewdly cast, hasn't e-mailed in his performance.
The racially variegated school Charlie has landed in is full of insecure and unhappy kids who feel better baring their souls to him in the stalls of the boys' bathroom. He sits in one stall and the "patient" parks in the adjacent one, undergoing therapy with the faux-anonymity of Catholic confession. Charlie fakes their symptoms for an assortment of shrinks who write him prescriptions, which he fills and resells for $10 at school. The surprise is that Charlie is actually a talented shrink. He asks questions that lead to actual answers. He listens.
In exchange for his psychiatric prowess, Charlie conquers the school, taming his chain-smoking, weed-dealing bully (Tyler Hilton), befriending the lovable slow kid (Dylan Taylor), and handing his virginity to Susan (Kat Dennings), the wonderful eyelinered drama girl who happens to be the principal's daughter. Director Jon Poll (a veteran film editor) and writer Gustin Nash, making their debuts, have whipped up the rare high school movie that doesn't see teenagers as jokes itching to be told or tragedies waiting to happen. It helps tremendously that every single young actor in this movie has a natural, unforced personality and a plain face you don't often see in Hollywood. They also seem as though they might have attended an actual high school.
What the movie lacks in technical polish (it's not very handsome-looking) and dramatic perfection, it makes up for in unusual social sophistication. No one is happy staying within the lines of his or her type. The slut wants romance. The suicide case wants stage fame. The jock wants to paint. Charlie the spoiled preppie doesn't want entitlement. And the principal really just wants to teach. School isn't the prison these people perceive it to be. The caste system is.
An eccentric, unfashionably corny movie grows from this organic expansion of types. Cat Stevens's "If You Want to Sing Out, Sing Out" is performed at least twice. And Charlie appears to enjoy nothing more than sitting at the piano and singing the "All in the Family" theme song with his mother. The movie is set in this century, but its heart beats in 1971. Yelchin even has the mischievously expressive face of a Bob Fosse dancer. It's boyish, but the mysterious angles are possibly hand-carved. He could be playing a politician named Pinocchio. We never meet Charlie's dad (he's in a white-collar prison), but I'm betting it's Geppetto.
Yelchin, who was impressive as the kidnappee in "Alpha Dog," is also a striking actor. You don't notice him here until a school-play audition where he breaks character to become a flamboyant queen in something called "Misadventures of a Teen Renegade." (If the movie is even a little bit of a hit, the line "Daddy, I think I'm sluffing" will live forever.) But even when he's just listening, as he is in a couple of beautiful scenes with Dennings, he's still captivating.
"Charlie Bartlett" is just as preoccupied with the give-and-take between authority and rebellion as its peers. But this movie is unique in its unwillingness to cede ground to either side. Neither the kids nor the adults have the upper hand for long. The grown-ups, as dysfunctional as they are (namely the principal), have the wisdom of experience - and Charlie, being the listener he is, actually pays attention. The movie may well be propaganda in the student-administrator wars. But if Robert Downey Jr. wants to give me a lecture about the downside of drug use, I'm all ears.


Appropriating many of the rebel responsibilities of Ferris Bueller and Rushmore 's Max Fischer but little of their fresh charms, the title teen iconoclast  of this antic yet bland comedy is showily updated for our psychotropic age. Rich kid Charlie Bartlett , an (Alpha Dog 's Anton Yelchin) becomes a guru-hero to his classmates, holding shrink sessions in the high school bathroom and handing out prescription elixirs (i.e., antidepressants, Ritalin) to the needy. Robert Downey Jr. is an uncomfortable sight as the school's hard-drinking, overstressed  principal.

 Ever since he played a forlorn 11-year-old boy in the insufferable 2001 tear-jerker “Hearts in Atlantis,” the Russian-born actor Anton Yelchin has seemed destined to step into the shoes of Hollywood’s favorite quiz kid, Matthew Broderick. And in the precociously articulate title character of “Charlie Bartlett,” he may have found a contemporary equivalent of Mr. Broderick’s beloved hooky-playing high school trickster, Ferris Bueller.  Mr. Yelchin has the routine down pat. He speaks in the elevated, faintly whiny tone and deliberate cadences of an honor student tossing off a difficult oral exam.  Even under stress, he exhibits the composure of a smarty-pants who, beneath his lost-boy affectations, is inordinately pleased with himself. In spite of your qualms, you root for him.  Mr. Yelchin, at 18, is six years younger than Mr. Broderick was when “Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” was released in 1986, and he has a good decade ahead of him to corner the market on adolescent prodigies like Charlie. A rich kid bounced out of prep school for making fake IDs, Charlie is forced to attend the institution of last resort, the local high school. He arrives with ludicrous grandeur by chauffeured limousine, wearing a blue blazer with Latin insignia and toting a fancy briefcase.  An instant pariah who craves popularity, Charlie wins friends and influences people only after he hits on the notion of becoming the student drug dealer. But not the usual kind. Instead of pot, cocaine and speed, he dispenses a pharmacy’s worth of prescription drugs like Ritalin, Xanax and Prozac, obtained by studying physicians’ reference books, then visiting psychiatrists and feigning symptoms the doctors are only too quick to treat with the latest medications.  In the movie’s funniest scene, Charlie and his business partner Murphy, the school bully who beat him up and dunked his head in the toilet when he first arrived, dispense Ritalin to the students and turn a dance into a frenzied free-for-all with bare-breasted girls running down the halls.  The movie, directed by Jon Poll from a screenplay by Gustin Nash, is never more amusingly subversive than in this scene, which suggests the hypocrisy of American attitudes toward drugs without putting it in words. The major difference between physician-prescribed “good” drugs like antidepressants and tranquilizers and “bad” drugs like marijuana and cocaine, it implies, has to do with the sanctification of some by the medical,  pharmaceutical and legal establishments and the outlawing of others, which, given their effects, seems somewhat arbitrary.  From his therapy experiences,  Charlie picks up how to act the role of shrink. Operating from a toilet stall in the boys’ room, he conducts therapy sessions with his troubled peers, who line up for his services and to whom he doles out what he deems appropriate medication.  Most of his advice is empathetic common sense.  It eventually backfires when a troubled student attempts suicide using pills Charlie has provided.  If the attention span of “Charlie Bartlett” didn’t wander here and there, the movie might have been a high school satire worthy of comparison with Alexander Payne’s “Election.” But as it dashes around and eventually turns soft, it loses its train of thought.  One story involves Charlie’s relationship with his flaky, depressed mother, Marilyn (Hope Davis, who also played the mother of Mr. Yelchin’s character in “Hearts in Atlantis”), with whom he sits at the piano singing old television theme songs. As Charlie’s troubles escalate, it dawns on Marilyn that perhaps she shouldn’t have treated him as an adult all his life. Ms. Davis plays her with an off-center joviality that is both charming and creepy.  Wise child that he is, Charlie understands that he is his mother’s emotional caretaker and lifeline to whatever stability she can muster. Barely touched on is Charlie’s estrangement from his father, in prison for tax evasion.  The other major strand of the story is Charlie’s embattled relationship with the school’s principal. A former history teacher who loathes his new job so much it has turned him into an alcoholic, Principal Gardner  (Robert Downey Jr.) runs afoul of the student body when he goes along with the superintendent’s insistence on installing surveillance cameras in the student lounge.  Charlie’s conflict with the principal turns into warfare once Gardner learns that Charlie is dating his rebellious daughter, Susan (Kat Dennings). It worsens when, partly at Charlie’s instigation, organized protest against the surveillance erupts into a riot. Mr. Downey bravely attempts to bring some depth and compassion to the principal. But as the movie dashes from one base to the next, it never coalesces into the character-driven, serious comedy with heart that you want it be.  “Charlie Bartlett” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has glimpses of nudity, strong language and mild violence.

In the comic vein of "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" or "Rushmore," frosh scribe Gustin Nash tosses out disposable moral lessons by the barrelful while editor-turned-helmer Jon Poll gleefully bats them over the fence in "Charlie Bartlett." Rollicking story of a rich kid whose wildly successful bid for popularity has him playing drug-distributing shrink to an entire high school boasts pitch-perfect faceoffs between upstart Anton Yelchin and alcoholic principal Robert Downey Jr. that could fuel a chemistry lab. Skedded for Aug. 3 release, sweetly subversive pic offers a chancy box office alternative to by-the-numbers summer fare.
Yelchin's adolescent Charlie Bartlett is an adorable, sincere -- and slick -- popularity-seeker. Introduced in the process of being kicked out of his umpteenth posh private school, this time for creating fake IDs ("Well, you have to admit they look very authentic," mother Hope Davis admiringly remarks), Charlie is sent off to public school, sporting a Latin-mottoed blazer and leather attache case.
Unfazed by mockery, beatings and having his head shoved into the toilet, Charlie continues to make friendly overtures to pretty girls, bullies, the retarded, football heroes and nerds equally. Driven by a strange mix of curiosity, empathy and benign manipulation to figure out exactly what makes people tick, he easily ascends to the role of school psychiatrist, setting up his practice in the boy's lavatory; he is greatly abetted by his access, via the family psychiatrist, to endless supplies of medications.
Charlie starts dating Susan (Kat Dennings), the daughter of Principal Gardner (Downey), whose move from iconoclastic history teacher to repressive bureaucrat has already driven him deep into the bottle. Soon the principal finds his professional and parental authority usurped by a fresh-faced teen with a "helpful" answer for everything.
As the link between Yelchin and Downey, Dennings packs less emotional ammo, but has a sensual sense of humor that almost fits the bill. Teen heartthrob Tyler Hilton is priceless as a Mohawk-coiffed bully who undergoes various transformations under Charlie's tutelage.
Pic is chock-full of character-building epiphanies and precautionary warnings parents can comfortingly latch onto, if blind to the fact that few of the homilies really stick; none of them makes the same impression as Downey's drunken, pistol-packing exhortation to never attack a gun-waving drunk. Nor, for that matter, can they hold a candle to the loopy TV-theme duets sung by Charlie and his mother, flawlessly executed in vintage jazz style.
Though the filmmakers no doubt believe that carelessly administered prescription drugs can be harmful, the sight of Charlie bouncing off the walls on Ritalin provides a joyous wallow in vintage Sennett-style overcranking.
Pic makes a strong case for a solid writer-director split, since Nash's sententious-leaning script, passing through the anarchic energy of Poll's direction, creates precisely balanced anomalies -- like Charlie himself, and those lovely, multilayered exchanges between Downey and Yelchin.
Toronto-shot pic plainly profits from its transposed locations by the hiring of Canuck lenser Paul Sarossy: The same transparent intimacy, usually informing Atom Egoyan's psychological labyrinths, is here placed in the service of clear-eyed comedy.

Like most wannabe heroes of the eager-to-please teen comedy, poor little rich boy Charlie Bartlett  (Anton Yelchin ) is too charming by half and not nearly quirky enough. Expelled from his ritzy private school, our blazered hero soon finds himself dispatched to a public school by his desperate single mother (Hope Davis ). Some mild narrative edge—Charlie goes into business supplying the student body with prescription drugs—is soon lost when we hit the troubled-youth talking points: overmedicated adolescents ill-served by crumbling high schools, a drug-happy medical establishment, and malfunctioning parents. Davis is intelligent as Marilyn Bartlett , who's partial to washing down her own meds with Chardonnay and treats her son as a replacement husband. But as the school's barely coping principal, Robert Downey Jr.  seems muffled. Which may be why he's given a gun to wave around in the third act, before everything falls into wholesome place. Like its anodyne hero, Charlie Bartlett  wants to make mischief, but it wants even more to get a gold star.
