In this French biopic of painter Séraphine de Senlis (Yolande Moreau), the collector (Ulrich Tukur) who transforms her from a grubby maid into the toast of the 1930s gallery scene describes her art as ''modern primitive.'' But he may as well be talking about Séraphine herself. She chats with trees and bathes  naked in the local river, peering at the civilized world with wary eyes. Moreau is bewitching  she simply breathes her role, without a hint of vanity. Neither she nor Séraphine  itself is in any rush to make you love this character, or even understand her. And yet, when Séraphine's face lights up in the rapture of her work, you feel as though you just might do both. A–

 Making a film about the life of an artist is a risky proposition. The paint box arrives full of clichés and unexamined assumptions about the creative temperament, and these grow more assertive if mental illness is part of the biographical material. You are likely to end up with a lot of huffing and puffing and mystification, rather than any real insight into the mysteries of the work.  There are exceptions. Maurice Pialat’s “Van Gogh” (1991), one of a slew of movies about that unhappy genius, is one, and “Séraphine,” Martin Provost’s new film, winner of seven Césars, including best film, is another. Maybe French movies about painters with a special gift for rendering flowers are exempt from the usual banal biopic logic. Not that “Séraphine” escapes entirely from the genre’s default settings. Still, its energies are devoted, for the most part, not to dissecting childhood traumas or recirculating stale cultural gossip, but rather to examining the alchemy by which perception is transformed into vision.  And Mr. Provost makes the case that Séraphine de Senlis, who was born Séraphine Louis and took the name of her hometown, not far from Chantilly in central France, was a visionary. That is not what the other residents of Senlis would have said. Making a meager living as a housekeeper and laundress, Séraphine (Yolande Moreau) is, when we first encounter her, an eccentric and slightly pathetic local character, a figure of pity and sometimes mockery, her dignity protected by a temperament that is at once sharp and childlike, and by a talent that she views as guided by angels.  She has the good luck to work for Wilhelm Uhde (Ulrich Tukur), a German collector and art critic who is rusticating in Senlis and struggling with some demons of his own. Uhde, an early patron of Picasso and Braque, was also famous for having discovered and popularized the work of Rousseau, a Belgian customs officer whose vibrant and exotic paintings seemed to come from nowhere and find their way to the very center of modern consciousness. Séraphine strikes Uhde as a similar kind of artist: self-taught, working in isolation and producing work that seems uncannily out of this world and ahead of its time.  He rejects the habit of calling this kind of art “naïve,” preferring the term “primitive modernism.” Nowadays Séraphine would most likely be called an outsider artist, and her difficult and incomplete assimilation into the marketplace is central to the film’s drama.  The relationship between her and Uhde is a chaste, complicated love story. A gay man in a small town, a German living in France on the eve of  World War I, he is in some ways more of an outsider than Séraphine, who is both rooted in and confined by her life in Senlis.  Their partnership, and Séraphine’s career,  are interrupted by the outbreak of war, and brought to a crisis later by the Great Depression, but these historical catastrophes, while they shape Mr. Provost’s narrative, do not dominate the film.  Instead, the director is properly immersed in the sensual and spiritual dimensions of Séraphine’s art, which grows out of an ecstatic — both in the erotic and religious sense — engagement with the natural world. She paints fruits and flowers in arrangements that at first look merely decorative, like the patterns on wallpaper or pottery, but that on closer examination are charged with a marvelous and unsettling power.  The same might be said about Ms. Moreau’s performance, which is passionate, humorous and heartbreaking. A large, slow-moving woman with a wide, fleshy face and small, intense eyes, she is graceful and elusive, giving clues to Séraphine’s rich and vivid inner life without spelling out or overdramatizing her peculiar and perhaps unknowable state of mind.  The mystery of Séraphine de Senlis — who died in a mental hospital in 1942 and whose work survives in some of the world’s leading museums — is left intact at the end of “Séraphine.” Rather than trying to explain Séraphine, the film accepts her.

A naive, between-the-wars French painter is brought to vivid life in the satisfying fact-inspired drama "Seraphine." An extraordinary perf by vet thesp Yolande Moreau in the title role will propel this throwback example of vintage Euro arthouse storytelling to a larger canvas of fests, theatrical deals and homevid.
Just prior to the Great War, in the small town of Senlis, not far from Paris, middle-aged loner Seraphine Louis (Moreau) works a grueling series of domestic jobs while painting at night. In her fleeting free time, she communes with nature, furtively gathering soil, animal's blood and even the run-off oil from church candles to mix the paints she otherwise couldn't afford. Fittingly, her intricate, colorful canvases are of fruit and flowers run riot.
When the German art critic Wilhelm Uhde (Ulrich Tukur) and his sister Anne-Marie (Anne Bennent) move to town, he's shocked to discover one of Seraphine's smaller paintings at a dinner party thrown by the well-to-do art lover Madame Duphot (Genevieve Mnich).
Uhde buys all Seraphine's work promptly, with the middle of the pic delineating the delicate relationship between aesthete and savant.
Interrupted by World War I, during which Seraphine stays in the nearly deserted town and paints through shellings and scares, the artist and critic are reunited in the late 1920s, with her rapid mental deterioration leading to a sad, tragic end.
Helmer and co-writer Martin Provost brings a pastoral eye to the story, layering the tale with a discreet visual style while at the same time firmly understanding the pic belongs to Moreau. Her Seraphine is a creature at once pitiable and divine, a natural talent so devoted to expression that all else is meaningless. 
Vet Tukur convinces as an aesthete thrilled to be in the presence of greatness but smart enough to know he'll never understand her muse.
Tech package is sumptuous but still manages to sell the squalor. Artist is more familiarly known as Seraphine de Senlis.

Martin Provost 's lyrical but bracing portrait of the early-20th-century French painter Séraphine Louis  begins and ends with a quietly ecstatic shot of the artist nestling up to the rustling leaves of a majestic tree. In Provost's vision, the dirt-poor country housekeeper's elemental flower paintings, derided by her bourgeois neighbors, are powered by her love of nature, the direct line she believes she has to the Virgin Mary , and the support of Wilhelm Uhde  (Ulrich Tukur ), a German collector whose floors Séraphine scrubs with the same fervor she brings to collecting chicken blood to mix her own brand of red paint. If Séraphine's untutored primitivism is a romance imposed by the filmmaker—in real life, she sat in on art classes for young ladies in Paris—it's a compelling one that seduced an adoring French public and earned the movie seven Césars, including a well-deserved Best Actress award for Yolande Moreau . The actress brings a potent restraint to this beady-eyed, unkempt, and all but feral outcast who seethes with inner struggle between strength and appalling vulnerability. Séraphine's dependence on her patron—a cultivated but emotionally detached homosexual, who knew a fellow outsider when he saw one but came and went in her life without warning—is almost as unbearably moving as her inevitable unraveling—when money and fame cut the artist off from her creative wellsprings and drove her over the edge.
