         It's fitting that Truly Indie, the DIY arm of Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner's 2929 Entertainment, is releasing the movie "Cavite." Truly Indie offers distribution and marketing to independent filmmakers, and "Cavite," co-written and directed by Ian Gamazon and Neill Dela Llana, is about as indie as you can get.
 
 Made on a shoestring budget with a primary crew of two, the film is a dark, riveting thriller set in the Philippines and deeply personal with an appropriately edgy digital-video aesthetic. The filmmakers had resourcefully written a tight, densely plotted screenplay they could shoot themselves in a short time and set out to execute it. However, unable to find a female willing to accompany them to the islands to play the lead role, they rewrote the script for a man and Gamazon reluctantly took on the part.
 


         






   Adam is a brooding, frustrated 32-year-old Filipino American living in San Diego and working a dead-end security job. A frantic call from his mother summons him to the Philippines for what we later learn is the funeral of his father.
 
 At the Manila airport, Adam's mother doesn't show to pick him up. Suddenly, a cellphone rings. Adam apprehensively reaches into his backpack, into which someone has slipped an envelope containing the phone and graphic photographs. A voice on the phone informs Adam that his mother and sister have been kidnapped and he is to follow the man's explicit orders or they will be killed.
 
 Thrust into the roiling culture of a people and language he barely knows, Adam grudgingly follows the instructions leading him to the extremely impoverished streets of Cavite City, about 20 miles southwest of Manila. The voice on the end of the phone taunts him constantly, challenging his manhood and upbraiding him for his discomfort with speaking Tagalog.
 
 Gamazon and Dela Llana adroitly involve the viewer in Adam's plight, using the classic storytelling device of placing the audience in the same predicament as the protagonist. Adam is not a particularly sympathetic character initially, but Dela Llana's hand-held camera and the film's breakneck editing place us squarely in Adam's shoes. There is no choice but to go along for the ride.
 
 The only pauses the film takes are when Adam stops to catch his breath — which are also the points at which a dead body or a severed finger in a cigarette carton are mostly likely to turn up. The hot, humid environment practically sweats through the screen, and when Adam crosses a garbage dump holding his nose it is easy to imagine its pungency.
 
 As the voice on the phone leads him through a series of increasingly dangerous errands, Adam gets a harsh reawakening of his Filipino heritage. Though the film seldom deviates from its thriller format, Gamazon and Dela Llana astutely weave in matters of political, cultural and religious importance, elevating "Cavite" well above mere genre.
 
 On screen throughout, sometimes at invasively close quarters, Gamazon holds the screen like a pro. Desperate and angry, Adam resents the orders he's given but painfully transforms himself from a callow, inward-looking American to a battle-weary citizen of the world. We never learn what Adam's hopes and aspirations are, but by the end of the film we've been shown a character study of a young man who agonizingly learns who he really is.
 
 Gamazon and Dela Llana use the hardscrabble guerrilla filmmaking to their advantage in carving out a smart film that explores Adam's hard-boiled cultural rebirth as he journeys through the back alleys and dusty squatters' camps of his homeland. The imaginative filmmakers also manage to keep what could easily have been a gimmick fresh and compelling to the end.

 Terrorism and cultural identity are only two of the themes wound into a tight knot of fear and bewilderment in "Cavite," a gripping no-budget political thriller.  Written and directed by two Filipino-Americans, Ian Gamazon and Neill Dela Llana, "Cavite" is a textbook example of seat-of-the-pants guerrilla filmmaking. It was shot on the fly with jiggling handheld cameras that scour the teeming streets, squatter shacks and garbage-clogged waterways of Cavite, an impoverished city on the outskirts of Manila. Cavite is the Philippines' seat of independence, where Emilio Aguinaldo overthrew Spanish rule in 1898, and his statue looms in the film like a silent sentinel.  Taking in these sights for the first time is Adam (Mr. Gamazon), a night watchman at the San Diego harbor, who is summoned to the Philippines to attend his father's funeral. Even before he goes, there are ominous portents. His pregnant girlfriend informs him by telephone that she is having an abortion because she doesn't want the child to be brought up Muslim, even though there are few signs that Adam is faithful to the religion in which he was reared.  When he arrives in Manila, his mother isn't there to meet him, and she doesn't answer the telephone. As he paces outside the terminal, a cellphone that has been mysteriously slipped into his luggage jingles. An ominous male voice, dripping with contempt, informs him that his mother and sister have been kidnapped. If he fails to follow instructions to the letter, they will be killed. From here on, that unseen and apparently omniscient observer, who knows Adam's every move, calls the shots.  If "Cavite" borrows its concept from the empty 2002 thriller "Phone Booth," Adam's subsequent ordeal is grounded in grim political reality. The caller eventually reveals himself as a member of the militant Islamic group Abu Sayyaf.  We hear that Adam's once politically active father betrayed the movement and moved to the United States after some financial double-dealing, only returning to the Philippines to pick up some money he had stashed. Or so the caller insists. He demands that Adam remove the money from the bank and deliver it to him. The drop-off takes place at a cockfighting exhibition.  But first Adam is forced to take a tour of the slums, to have his nose rubbed in the poverty and stink of the culture his family abandoned. The bullying caller, obsessed with manhood, sneeringly questions Adam's heterosexuality and berates him for preferring English to Tagalog and for never having made a pilgrimage to Mecca.  He forces Adam to "taste" Filipino culture by consuming a balut (a fertilized duck egg with a nearly developed embryo) sold on the street. Directed to a pack of cigarettes on a bench, Adam opens it to discover a severed finger, which the caller says belongs to his sister.  Even after delivering the money, Adam finds his work isn't done. In one last, fateful instruction, he is given the grim choice of carrying out a terrorist act or losing his loved ones.  "Cavite" suffers mightily from the fact that Mr. Gamazon can't act. The lead was originally to have been female, but, according to the production notes, no actress would accompany the filmmakers to the Philippines. At the last minute Mr. Gamazon filled in.  He can feign befuddlement, low anxiety and peevish stubbornness. But the deeper emotions of fear, anger and sorrow elude him, as do any signs of illumination; his performance is a blank. Tilting toward the opposite extreme, the unseen (and uncredited) caller sounds like a fiendish villain in a Grade B spy movie.  But this unblinking tour of Asian misery nevertheless offers an unsettling contemplation of life at the bottom of the human food chain. It touches on all the questions about nationality, faith, immigration, assimilation, globalization, poverty and the roots of terrorism that people are asking themselves,  questions that aren't about to be answered either tomorrow or the day after.

Resourceful "Cavite" proves there's more than one way to make a terrorism thriller. Following a young Filipino-American on a crazed journey as he's forced to commit an act of terror by a faceless kidnapper, pic plunks hero and viewers down into the grinding poverty from which such terror sometimes springs. Pic is the most vitally political of the better American indies on the current fest circuit (where it nabbed prizes at South by Southwest and S.F. Asian American fests), and should score a deal with a risk-taking specialty distrib.
Co-director-writer-editor-soundman Ian Gamazon is practically the only on-screen character, tracked by a camera operated by co-director-writer-lenser-editor-soundman Neill Dela Llana. This two-man band has made a dramatic feature as one might make a docu on a single human subject. Ironically, this fertile filmmaking condition was borne of necessity rather than design, when initial casting plans for a female lead fell through.
Action is unsteady at first, with blurry nighttime footage in the small city of Cavite, near Manila. Shift to San Diego harbor, where Adam (Gamazon) works as a night guard and receives wordfrom his pregnant g.f. (Dominique Gonzalez) that she's not willing to have a child with Muslim-raised Adam and therefore wants an abortion. A call from Adam's family in the Philippines informs him that his father has just died. 
Arriving at Manila airport to meet his family, Adam receives a cell phone call from a fierce-sounding stranger (a remarkable uncredited vocal perf) who claims to have kidnapped Adam's loved ones as part of a mission for a terrorist group.
His sister's severed finger is a sign the kidnapper means business.
Adam's instructions take him around the impoverished streets of Cavite,  in and out of people's homes, across a polluted swamp, down gang-infested alley ways, and for cash exchanges that get more and more curious.
While the terrorist always seems to know where his prey is, this genre device, with echoes of "Phone Booth" and "Cellular," is overwhelmed by the grim urban setting, relentless action and Gamazon's admirably durable performance.
Pic departs from genre convention with an ending that delivers impressive impact. For a guerrilla-style, no-budget Yank indie to even tackle issues of jihad terror and naive Western thinking  is noteworthy in itself, but Gamazon and Dela Llana inflame the issues with a gutsy, athletic filmmaking package that shows what can be done with a minimum of tools.

A paragon of guerrilla resourcefulness and a model citizen of the global village, Cavite  is a more anxious and vivid experience than most movies with budgets literally a thousand times bigger. This impressively tense micro-thriller was made for little more than the cost of a pair of economy-class tickets to Manila , by a two-man cast and crew: the Filipino American duo Ian Gamazon  and Neill Dela Llana, who between them, wrote, directed, produced, photographed, edited, and starred in the film.
Shot entirely on location (and without permits), the film steals a few quick scenes aboard a transpacific airliner before launching with full vertiginous force into a quasi-real-time ransom countdown. Adam (Gamazon), a lapsed Muslim who works as a security guard in San Diego (and is navigating a rough patch with his newly pregnant American girlfriend), travels home to the Philippines  for his father's funeral. At the Manila airport, having discovered a cell phone and a severed finger in his luggage, he finds himself a helpless pawn in a terrorist plot. Taking instructions from an unseen Abu Sayyaf  operative who has kidnapped his mother and sister, Adam embarks on a forced tour of the slums of greater Manila.
Despite its indie ingenuity, Cavite is a blockbuster at heart, a no-budget relation to screenwriter Larry Cohen 's beat-the-clock contraptions Cellular  and Phone Booth ; the filmmakers have proudly cited Speed  as a key influence. But the movie's documentary elements are its selling point. The Philippine shantytowns, terra incognita for most Western audiences (Lino Brocka 's groundbreaking melodramas remain largely unavailable and underseen), are only now starting to come into view: Cavite  had its New York premiere at New Directors/New Films this year alongside a somewhat more buoyant portrait of slum life, Auraeus Solito's The Blossoming of Maximo Oliveros  . Dela Llana 's nimble video camera shadows Gamazon through the squatter camps and garbage mountains in the titular town on the outskirts of the Philippine capital. After an exotic detour to a cockfighting ring, the movie reaches a sweaty-palmed climax in a crowded Catholic church, the intended terrorist target.
The premise may carry a whiff of exploitation, but the awful poverty on display never seems unduly touristic, partly because Adam's sense of bewildered foreignness is very much the point, and also because the increasingly dire locations are less backdrop than contextextreme conditions, as the film implicitly notes, can breed extremism. Cavite  is such a shrewd melding of form and content that any seeming contradictions and shortcomings end up working to the film's advantage. The raw, hectic videography suits the freaked-out tenor of Adam's stricken excursion. The quizzical looks of the locals, as this Americanized Filipino blunders through their midst, are unfeigned and wholly apt. And as Gamazon himself squirms under relentless scrutiny, struggles with his rusty Tagalog, and reacts to the uglier aspects of a motherland he no longer knows (or maybe never did), any conventional notion of acting seems beside the point. Fueled by guilt, sorrow, and above all, visceral alienation, Cavite  is a nightmare vision of an expatriate's homecomingit's some kind of landmark in diaspora cinema.
