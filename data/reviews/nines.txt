         "Creator" is a job description that gets tossed around a lot in Hollywood without much thought to its transcendental implications. But screenwriter John August ("Go" and "Big Fish") had plenty of time to ponder them during a highly creative nervous breakdown in 2000, after he was fired from a TV show he had created. The experience of being exiled from his own imaginary world (the show, "D.C.," continued for a while without him), left him dangling in a kind of limbo between his real life and his fictional one, and inspired the mysterious and often hilarious ontological freak-out that is "The Nines," his directorial debut.
 
 A puzzle film in the vein of "Mulholland Drive," "The Nines" consists of three linked stories that exist in distinct but overlapping parallel universes, each challenging the other's claim to reality. The same actors -- Ryan Reynolds, Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy -- play different characters in each, although their roles serve similar functions. Reynolds is an actor in the first story, a screenwriter in the second and a TV character who is a famous video game designer in the third. Through each of these characters, questions of identity and existence, creation and control, reality and fantasy are attacked from almost every conceivable angle, spinning a grabby mystery that ultimately can't be solved.
 


         






   Rather than come across as fantastic or dreamlike, the stories have a vivid, hyperreal quality to them. This is especially true of the first two, in which the main characters are so thoroughly integrated into the workings of Hollywood that their difficulty in distinguishing fact from fantasy is both an occupational hazard and a reflection of reality. Not only is spending a large part of one's life in a fantasy world a perfectly sane thing to do, it's also a result of success.
 
 In the first story, called "The Prisoner," Reynolds plays the charming but feckless star of a TV cop drama who one morning impulsively barbecues  his ex-girlfriend's left-behind possessions, then sets out in his car on a booze cruise of Sunset Boulevard. The bus that pulls up next to him with an ad for his show splashed across its side presents just the first of several identity conundrums (he's compelled to point out to some drug dealers that he only plays a cop on TV), which include hallucinatory glimpses of himself as the film's other characters in the back seat.
 
 Gary's wild ride ends in house arrest, which he can't serve in his own home because he has accidentally burned it down. Installed by his handlers in the house of a successful screenwriter who is away shooting a pilot in Toronto, Gary finds himself subjected to all kinds of artificial measures designed to keep him rooted in place. Borders are drawn on the property, he must make daily voice-recognition phone calls to a computer, and, later, an electronic ankle shackle monitors not only his physical whereabouts but any attempt to escape  the present circumstances via drugs or alcohol. As Margaret (McCarthy), a perky publicist assigned to act as his warden and baby-sitter, tries to keep Gary within bounds and Sarah (Hope Davis), a bored and flirtatious new mother next door, tempts him to cross the lines, Gary begins to hear noises and see things that lead him to suspect that reality is not what he thinks it is.
 
 Of course, Gary is an actor and 
a troubled celebrity -- at work, he is who other people tell him to be, and in his personal life, the edges of his world are being constantly defined and policed by other people. By contrast, the main character of the second story ("Reality Television") is almost eerily in control. Gavin the screenwriter (also played by Reynolds) is a calm, self-possessed TV writer in the final stages of having his show, an open-ended mystery called "Knowing," picked up by a network. The development executive in charge, Susan (Davis), assures him it's a done deal, but soon Gavin starts to find that even as the show's creator, his powers are limited. Test audiences will have their say, and, ultimately, a shadowy network entertainment president will have the final word.
 
 Meanwhile, Gavin has agreed to star in a reality TV show that documents the making of a network television drama. As Gavin and Susan butt heads and tensions mount, it begins to dawn on him that his crisis is making for better television than he himself will be allowed to create by the focus group-obsessed powers that be. Ironically, this sad fact is reflected in the third story ("Knowing"), in which Reynolds plays Gavin's character, Gabriel, a video game designer whose car breaks down in the woods while on a drive with his wife, Mary (McCarthy), and creepy mute daughter Noelle (Elle Fanning). Considering the mystery and tension that August builds up in the first two acts, the third one comes as a bit of a letdown. Redolent of the open-ended serial mystery currently in vogue, complete with a Fanning child in mind-reading mode, it recalls how Hollywood product is so often much less interesting than its producers.
 
 Bright and vicious, desperate and cruel, the characters of the first two stories pop with a kind of nihilistic joie de vivre
  that makes you want to hug them and kill them at once. Reynolds shifts so easily from dumb TV star to slick producer to crunchy video game design god that he's hardly recognizable from one story to the next. McCarthy is especially affecting as a publicist whose harmless best friend demeanor masks a sinister amoral edge. And Davis is chilling as a formidable, craven development executive.
 
 Like David Lynch's recent "Inland Empire," "The Nines" scurries down a labyrinth of rabbit holes, compounding the mystery to the point of no return, and never really comes back. Still, August never descends into the psychedelic mire of that movie, or of, say,  the metaphysical bowl of oatmeal that was "The Fountain." On the contrary, it dispenses about a minor epiphany a minute and hooks you like a flounder. In the end, though, perhaps very much like a flounder, you're left flapping in the breeze with nothing more than a lure in your mouth, the painful realization there's always a bigger fish out there somewhere, pulling the strings and, for what it's worth, a deeper insight into the interconnectedness of it all. Which, on reflection, has got to be worth at least the price of admission.

Few network television series are as gripping, to me, as a good inside-dope dramatization of what goes on behind the scenes of network television. In the best episode (out of three) of the weirdly engrossing head-scratcher of a metaphysical puzzle movie The Nines , Ryan Reynolds plays a frazzled writer-producer who is out to get a new show on the air. He has promised the lead role to his friend (Melissa McCarthy), who is perky and plus-size, but the network brass, represented by a conniving Hope Davis, wants her replaced with a conventional babe. Reynolds, who showed a light spark of charisma in Blade: Trinity , here proves that he's an incisive actor. He makes the hero at once fey, knowing, and clueless, an artist who thinks he's playing Machiavellian politics when the politics have only just begun to play him.
The other mysteriously linked episodes of The Nines  aren't as fully realized, but I got caught up in the way they echo, mirror, and spill over into one another. In the first, Reynolds is a TV star stuck in the purgatory of house arrest after a drug bust; in the third, he's a videogame designer stranded, when his car fritzes out, with his wife and child. All three stories feature McCarthy and Davis, in different roles, doing battle over Reynolds, who is always some form of ''creator.'' There are even hints he could be, you know, the  Creator. (It's that kind of movie.) But John August directs it briskly, as a gossip-era Twilight Zone  of image and reality. You'll go ''Huh?'' but you won't feel cheated.

 In the three loosely related stories that make up “The Nines,” a philosophical mind teaser with satirical fangs that marks the directing debut of the screenwriter John August, the stressed-out psyches of jockeying Hollywood muckety-mucks are disturbed by strange metaphysical intimations. Think of it as a kind of “Twilight Zone 2007” in which the paranoia endemic to an industry that runs on illusion, hype and extravagant grandiosity comes home to roost.  For the Hollywood player with the right job description and available technology, isn’t it tempting to imagine being God? A video-game designer or a reality-television director, as omnipotent creator and manipulator of a discrete little world, may fancy himself possessor of the keys to the kingdom.  Even garden-variety stars are regarded as semicelestial beings. Feed them drugs, and the distinctions between heaven and earth begin to blur. As that wise old sage Leonard Cohen muses in his world-is-going-to-hell-in-a-hand-basket song of pseudoprophecy, “Everybody Knows”: “Everybody knows that you live forever when you’ve done a line or two.”  In “The Nines” the game designer, the television producer and the star are all played by Ryan Reynolds, a blond, handsome B-list actor who in this movie shows glimmerings of A-list talent. If Mr. August’s screenplay demonstrates some of the imagination of a Charlie Kaufman script (“Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,” for instance), “The Nines” isn’t a neatly packaged mind game like Mr. Kaufman’s cleverest films. Instead it playfully tosses out ideas, then leaves it to the viewer to read the pieces like tea leaves.  Mr. August’s screenwriting credits include “Go” (another three-part film), “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” “Big Fish,” “Corpse Bride” and two “Charlie’s Angels” movies. In the production notes for “The Nines” he writes that the middle chapter, in which a television producer has the rug pulled out from under him, is largely autobiographical.  Each section is about a half-hour long and features the same three actors. In Part 1, “The Prisoner,” Mr. Reynolds’s character, Gary, is a distraught television star who in a fit of rage tosses his ex-girlfriend’s clothes on the backyard barbecue, sets them on fire and goes on a bender of crack cocaine and booze that ends in a car crash. He winds up living under house arrest, tended by his unflappably cheerful publicist and devoted fixer, Margaret (Melissa McCarthy), who installs him in the empty house of a producer.  Idle and impatient, Gary begins a flirtation with Sarah (Hope Davis), his enigmatic, sexually aggressive next-door neighbor, and has hallucinations in which the number nine appears almost everywhere he looks. What does it mean? Margaret, who knows more than she is letting on, drops some provocative clues.  In Part 2, “Reality Television,” Mr. Reynolds plays Gavin, the house’s owner, whose latest project, “Knowing,” is a supernatural drama created for his best friend, Ms. McCarthy (who plays herself).  He originally pitched it as “Rosemary’s Toddler.” A network is supposedly high on the show, whose development is being filmed by Gavin as a “Project Greenlight”-like reality series under the supervision of Susan (Ms. Davis), his closest ally at the network.  At the last minute Susan betrays him and takes the side of the network boss who suddenly insists on replacing Ms. McCarthy with another actress. It is up to Gavin to deliver the bad news. And the scene in which he lowers the boom on her is such an awkward, ugly and painful confrontation, it feels as though it might have taken place.  In Part 3, “Knowing,” Mr. Reynolds is Gabriel, a video-game designer hiking in the Hollywood Hills with his wife, Mary (Ms. McCarthy), and their mute young daughter (Elle Fanning). Returning to their car, they find its battery dead and their cellphone reception blocked. Leaving his wife and daughter in the car, Gabriel goes to seek help and on the road meets Sierra (Ms. Davis), a hiker who at first shuns him, then reappears offering assistance that soon turns sinister. This third story could be an episode of Gavin’s series “Knowing,” as it might have been directed before Ms. McCarthy’s firing.  What matters in “The Nines” is how these vignettes glance off one another. The fact that the same actors appear in all three chapters gives you the uneasy sense that they might be variations of the same story, set in overlapping universes, in which the female characters, especially those played by Ms. McCarthy, know all the answers, which they are not allowed to reveal.  “The Nines” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language, some drug content and sexuality.

Though he's since penned three Tim Burton features and both "Charlie's Angels" pics, John August's directorial debut more closely resembles his first produced screenplay, 1999's "Go." The interlocking multistory structure, bright dialogue and surprising twists of fate are all present again, though this isn't another "Pulp Fiction"-ish joyride. Instead, ambitious "The Nines" arcs from witty Hollywood insiderdom to a climactic metaphysical leap that may leave many viewers nonplussed. Nonetheless, there's more than enough intelligence, intrigue and performance dazzle to make this an adventuresome gizmo for grownups -- albeit one whose complexity presents marketing challenges.
Ryan Reynolds, Hope Davis and Melissa McCarthy play different roles in the three successive tales whose true relationship to each other is only hinted at until the last few minutes. It's then that "The Nines" doesn't so much falter as go off in the kind of existential hypothesis that is very difficult to incorporate into a dramatic format.
Still, give August credit for going out on a limb -- and not falling off it like Darren Aronofsky's turgid recent "The Fountain." There's nothing dull in "The Nines," much of which is as sharp and original as any U.S. narrative at Sundance this annum.
Part One, entitled "The Prisoner," cuts to the chase: After his girlfriend leaves him, popular TV actor Gary (Reynolds) sets the clothes she left afire on the backyard BBQ. Later his whole house burns down, but Gary doesn't notice: He's already off on an epic bender of drinking and driving.
Resulting crash, arrest and public scandal require micro-managerial intervention from Margaret (McCarthy), his agency's professional minder of run-amuck celebrities. She sets him up to serve his house-arrest term in an absentee owner's splendid Beverly Hills manse.
At the manse, Gary has nothing to do, but distractions arise, including sexually forward next-door-neighbor Sarah (Davis). Then there are the creepy, poltergeist-y disturbances in the house itself: The number nine suddenly seems to pop up everywhere Gary looks.
After this chapter ends on a mysterious, CGI-enhanced note, "Part Two: Reality" introduces the same house's owner Gavin (Reynolds), a hugely successful screenwriter-cum-producer.
The insomniac, workaholic scribe's latest project is "Knowing," a supernatural drama (pitched as "Rosemary's Toddler") he wrote specially for longtime best friend Melissa McCarthy (playing herself) -- and for which she's left her (real-life) long-running series "Gilmore Girls." (Post-Sundance screening, August noted that he and she have a similar relationship in real life, and that this seg is more or less about him.)
Packaged as an episode of fake reality skein "Behind the Screen," this midsection follows neurotic Gavin through pilot production. His liaison to the all-powerful network programming boss is Drama Development VP Susan (Davis), who says she wants to help him get the show on the air.
But she seems to have a hidden agenda, too. Like Gary, Gavin begins to perceive something is amiss, with a final neat twist calling into question all we've seen before.
After a brief split-screen interlude, "Part Three: Knowing" presents videogame designer Gabriel (Reynolds), wife Mary (McCarthy) and their mute daughter (Elle Fanning) on a walk in the hills. Returning to their car, they find the battery is dead. Backtracking alone, Gabriel meets hiker Sierra (Davis), and things take an increasingly alarming, surreal turn.
Resolution and coda are not film's strongest points; they lack the humor hitherto threaded throughout, and address big questions that "The Nines" can't quite pull off, clever as the lead-up has been.
That said, the mix of authorial imagination and precision on display is most impressive, and in his first such effort August directs with as much alert confidence as he writes.
McCarthy and Davis are first-rate in roles that vary tonally but also have some significant overlaps. Reynolds gets a chance here like he's never had before -- though he's been consistently good-to-excellent in good-to-awful movies -- and he's sensational. Since it's long been clear he can do comedy, and it seems his dramatic range is broad as well, the question now isn't when he'll become an A-list star, but rather what kind he'll turn out to be.
Prod package is excellent all around, with stylish design contribs and sharp tech ones.

Go  and Charlie's Angels  screenwriter John August  wrote and directed this solipsistic, subCharlie Kaufman  head-trip about a washed-up cop-show actor confined to house arrest, a gay TV writer battling the network over his latest pilot, and a successful video-game designer whose family holiday turns sinister after his car breaks down in the woods. The catch is that the characters (all played by Ryan Reynolds ) are versionsor fragmentsof the same person, and as the successive storylines play out, it's clear that August is trying to show us the inner workings of a writer's mind. It's hardly a novel idea, but at least when Kaufman, David Lynch , or Michel Gondry  invites us on a tour of his chaotic subconscious, it's a fascinating place to visit. Plunging into August's gray matter is more like a season in vacation hell. The film's first section, in which Reynolds's vain sex symbol hooks up with his married neighbor (Hope Davis ), plays like outtakes from a low-rent porno; the middle section suggests a wan retread of The TV Set ; and the grand finalewhich we understand to be the troubled pilot itselfquickly qualifies as must-not-see TV. Each time around, Reynolds is haunted in some way by the titular numeral, a feeling likely to be shared by anyone who spends about that many dollars on a ticket.
