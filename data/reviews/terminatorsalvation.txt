At a certain point in "Terminator Salvation," grizzled savior of mankind John Connor (Christian Bale) heads out the door to do battle, turns to his pregnant wife (Bryce Dallas Howard), and growls, "I'll be back."
Oh, please. Tell us something we don't know.
The audience laughs with relief when he says that, of course, grateful to have a reminder of the loopy, relentless B-movie drive that enlivened the first "Terminator" 25 years ago. Pleasure is not on the punch-list this time, sadly. The latest installment in the venerable sci-fi action franchise turns out to be a straight-up war film, grim and muscular and thundering and joyless. It's the color of cement, and it weighs as much, too.
Will "Salvation" make a lick of sense if you haven't seen parts 1 through 3 (leaving aside TV's "Sarah Connor Chronicles")? Nope. Some background, then: In the earlier movies, the machines of the Skynet corporation have taken over Earth and done their level best to wipe out mankind, nuking cities and sending killer cyborgs - terminators - back through time to snuff out the future leader of the resistance both before and after he's born. One of these cyborgs was subsequently elected governor of California.
The new film almost but not quite closes the series' Mobius strip: The year is 2018 and John Connor (note the initials) is a revered leader of the ragtag remnants of humankind. Having concocted a radio signal with the power to jam the machines, the underground resistance plans a full-scale assault on Skynet Central in San Francisco.
This is complicated by two factors: The arrival of a mystery man named Marcus (Sam Worthington) and the abduction of a teenager named Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) into Skynet's concentration camp system. (The latter plotline includes visual echoes of the Holocaust; yes, it's offensive.) Those in the know will recall that Kyle must be saved because he'll go on to become John Connor's father after he's sent back to protect his mother . . . it gets complicated.
Most unusually, no one takes a trip in the Wayback Machine in "Terminator Salvation" - the new film is unique in resisting the temptation to muck with the temporal flow. Prologue aside, it's all 2018 all the time, and that's a bummer. The pop thrill of the "Terminator" series was always its mock-profound time travel gimmickry: The future kept barreling back to the past. Everything was tense.
Here, everything is war. The director is a fellow named McG and apparently he emptied out the paintbox on his "Charlie's Angels" movies, since "Terminator Salvation" has been daubed metallic gray from one end to the other. It's like watching ordnance on parade. Bale might just be the grayest thing here, since his John Connor (you can't not call him by both names) never blinks and says all his lines in the same hoarse bark. The performance is hellaciously focused, all right, but it's also the dullest acting Bale's ever done. Perhaps he's saving the passion for YouTube.
In the void left by the star, the film becomes more about the character of Marcus who (flashing lights, klaxon horn, spoiler alert) has a slight personality crisis brought on by the fact that he's half machine and doesn't yet know it. What drama "Terminator Salvation" possesses lives in the scenes between Marcus and curvy freedom fighter Blair (Moon Bloodgood, whose name, if it didn't exist, would have to be invented). He's a machine who wonders if he can love. She's a woman who wonders if she can love a machine. How would they raise the kids - with oil changes every 2,000 miles?
The other characters fade into the background, victims of clumsy storytelling. Neither Yelchin as Reese nor Howard as Mrs. John Connor has much to do, and rapper Common, as the hero's best friend, has even less. Blink and you'll miss acting legend Jane Alexander as a resistance matriarch. The PG-13 rating - a first for this series - is reflected in the presence of an adorable, sad-eyed, mute tyke named Star (Jadagrace) who tags along after Reese before transferring her affections to Marcus.
The lovingly filmed detonations are the real stars of "Terminator Salvation" - and the rock-em-sock-em chase scenes and the giant CGI battlebots and the falling chunks of masonry. For all the pricey action, though, you rarely feel the wow the other films delivered, especially the two directed by James Cameron. At one point, Marcus and Reese have to fight off souped-up motorcycle-bots, and you suddenly pinpoint the movie's problem - the villains are literally faceless.
Actually, in one scene they wear a face that's surreally familiar. A door opens and there stands the Terminator himself: Arnold Schwarzenegger, buck naked and lethal as ever. But wait - The Governator is still in Sacramento, and his face has been scanned and digitally wrapped onto the head of Austrian bodybuilder Roland Kickinger.
On the evidence of "Terminator Salvation," the machines are winning.

There are other mechanized aggressors   one resembles a flying saucer crossed with an electric shaver, one is like a five-story, looming, gigantoid version of RoboCop, only with a gun in place of its head. Watching Terminator Salvation , there is never any doubt that the machines are alive. Maybe that's because the whole movie is a bit of a machine.
The director, McG, is the wizard of whirligig whoop-ass who made the Charlie's Angels  movies, and here he dresses up what is basically a blowout-in-the-junkyard battle film as if it were a holy conflagration. The color is bleached to granulated newsreel white, black, and beige, for that dead-serious Full Metal Jacket  effect, and a transport car of human prisoners is shot to evoke the image of a death-camp train. McG also devises grimly novel ways to shoot action, like depicting a chopper crash in a single shot from the POV of John Connor (Christian Bale) as he pilots it to a topsy-turvy landing.
As a hero, Connor is really no more distinctive than the gnarly, unshaven outcast ringleader of every retro-future fantasy from Escape From New York  on. Yet Terminator Salvation  is invested in treating him like a grunge messiah. Bale brings the role his usual stylish, seething edge. He seems ready to blow at any moment, making his infamous on-set tantrum look less like a case of star egomania than like a Method actor's refusal to break character gone amok. Connor, leading a fringe of rebel fighters, is out to protect Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), a teenager who has no idea how important he is: If he lives, he will grow up to be Connor's father (the Michael Biehn character from the first Terminator ), and will therefore sire the resistance movement. But all the loop-the-loop, boy-is-father-to-the-man-who-must-protect-the-boy-or-the-man-won't-exist stuff is more fun to make sense of when you're leaving the theater. On screen, it's just a dimly revolving puzzle.
Time-tripping flimflammery aside, a good Terminator  movie needs a hook that's kick-ass basic. The 1984 classic had the vision of Arnold Schwarzenegger as a one-man demolition derby  an image that was also a Hollywood joke, since it turned Arnold's lousiness as an actor into the core of his appeal. T2: Judgment Day  had its rock-'em-sock-'em face-off and all that mercury-robot shape-shifting. Following the noise and faux fury of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines , Terminator Salvation  has more ingenuity but still a lot of noise. It's basically a zombie movie with machines instead of the walking dead, and with Sam Worthington as Marcus Wright, a vicious criminal made over into...something else. Confronted with Worthington's square-jawed stolidity, audiences may be forgiven for wondering if he's meant to be a young version of Schwarzenegger's Terminator. It turns out, though, that he's not so easy to read  nor nearly as entertaining. He's a machine we're supposed to feel for, but every time the film asks you to do so, you may taste metal. B–

 Correction Appended  “Terminator Salvation”? Really, that’s a bit grandiose. Given the quantities of distressed metal on display in this sturdy and serviceable sequel — only the fourth “Terminator” movie in a quarter-century — “Terminator Salvage” might be a more apt title. Still, some things are saved, even redeemed, in the course of the movie, including, perhaps, the audience’s interest in killer cyborgs from the future and the fate of the Connor family.  A detailed recap of the franchise’s empretzeled chronology will not be possible here. But recall that, way back in 1984, a mean and muscular killing machine, the T-800, showed up in Los Angeles spouting Austrian-accented catchphrases and trying to kill Sarah Connor, who was played by Linda Hamilton. Some of us still harbor fond memories of Ms. Hamilton’s way with a pump-action shotgun, and miss her all the more when her voice is heard on old tape recordings in the new movie, from which she is otherwise absent.  By 1991 and “Terminator 2: Judgment Day” the first terminator had turned friendly, and devoted himself to protecting Sarah’s son, John (Edward Furlong at the time), from another killer android, who was determined to prevent young John from growing into a leader of the anti-machine guerrilla resistance. But John survived, grew into Nick Stahl and has now matured into Bruce Wayne — I mean Christian Bale, all grizzled cheekbones and frayed vocal cords — while the original T-800 runs the State of California.  And that’s without getting into the metaphysics of time travel, the self-updating allegory of technological anxiety, “The Sarah Connor Chronicles” on television or the complex development of a malignant military application called Skynet. Since the last installment, “Rise of the Machines,” a fairly pedestrian action film released in 2003, Skynet, having become “self-aware” (more, perhaps, than the films themselves), unleashed a nuclear holocaust and now wants to wipe out the resistance and the rest of humanity along with it. Eventually it will master time travel, but that will be in a future sequel, which makes the current one an act of extortion by Warner Brothers. If not enough people buy tickets to “Terminator Salvation,” we may never find out just how Arnold Schwarzenegger arrived in California.  After an early bit of foreshadowing set on death row in California in the present decade and featuring a bald Helena Bonham Carter, “Terminator Salvation” plants itself firmly in an apocalyptic future, the terrible year 2018. The death-row inmate, Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington), pops up for reasons that will become obvious to you long before they are revealed to him. He runs into various ragged resistance fighters, significantly including Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin), who will go back in time to become John Connor’s dad.  Wright also stumbles into a quasi-romance with Blair Williams (Moon Bloodgood), one of Connor’s lieutenants and a character who pays homage to Ms. Hamilton’s pioneering action-heroine achievements. (Bryce Dallas Howard, as Connor’s pregnant wife, upholds the maternal side of the original Sarah Connor legacy.)  The palette is a dull steely gray, coarsened by dust and rust and occasionally illuminated by a bright orange fireball. And the action, in spite of some aerial special effects and a few high-tech battles, is accordingly loud and blunt, a symphony of screaming gears, anguished torque and thumping collisions of metal and flesh. As the floor of the screening room rumbled and the walls seemed to shake, I began to wonder if Skynet were not a subsidiary of the Dolby Laboratories, softening up a few human targets before the big battle.  But the movie, directed by McG (yes, him, the one-named auteur at the helm of the “Charlie’s Angels” pictures) from a script by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, has a brute integrity lacking in some of the other seasonal franchise movies. It parades neither the egghead aspirations of “Star Trek” nor the thick-skulled pretensions of “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” but instead feels both comfortable with its limitations and justly proud of its accomplishments.  Among these are efficient, reasonably swift storytelling — the movie, less than two hours long, is densely populated with semi-important characters and crammed with exposition and incident, but it rarely feels busy or talky — and a mastery of the vernacular of chases, fights, explosions and crashes. McG may not yet have a signature style — he lacks the baroque vulgarity of Michael Bay (“Pearl Harbor” and “Transformers”) or the punchy inventiveness of Brett Ratner (the “Rush Hour” movies and “X-Men: The Last Stand”) — but he manages speed, impact and the choreography of technomayhem with aplomb and a measure of wit.  It has been a long time since the Terminator cycle served as a showcase for state-of-the-art cinematic special effects. The morphing of Robert Patrick’s flesh into metal in James Cameron’s “T2” was something new under the sun, but “Terminator Salvation” seems more like a throwback than a harbinger of things to come. Especially toward the end some shiny, floating video screens appear, but for the most part the aesthetic is mechanical rather than digital. With its clanks and creaks and broken-down contraptions, this movie is a battered Wall-E to “Star Trek’s” sleek and seamless Eve.  Which is fitting, since part of the point of the Terminator movies is to register ambivalence about technological progress, which fills our lives with all kinds of cool, convenient stuff that somehow brings an intimation of our eventual obsolescence. “Terminator Salvation,” digitally engineered to approximate a rough, analog feel, is less a cautionary tale than a consumer advisory. Enjoy your new gadgets, but don’t let them out of your sight, and don’t forget where the off switch is.  “Terminator Salvation” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).  Explosions. Fights. Mild profanity. Heaps of scrap metal.

Darker, grimmer and more stylistically single-minded than its two relatively giddy predecessors, "Terminator Salvation" boasts the kind of singular vision that distinguished the James Cameron original, the full-throttle kinetics of "Speed" and an old-fashioned regard for human (and humanoid) heroics. Only pic's relentlessly doomsday tone -- accessorized by helmer McG's grimy, gun-metal palette -- might keep auds from flocking like lemmings to the apocalypse. The fourth in the celebrated sci-fi series, "Salvation" opens and closes with humanity at war with the machines. In other words, this thing isn't going to end soon. Nor should it, if it keeps on like this. 
McG, whose segue from music vids to movies resulted in two "Charlie's Angels" extravaganzas and the woeful "We Are Marshall," exhibits an unexpected flair for the dreadful, abrupt and awesome. What we get here -- which was perhaps missing on the relatively sunny mental landscapes of "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" and "Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines" -- is a sense of real horror: When humans are snatched up like Cheez-Doodles by skyscraper-sized Go-bots, there's no slo-mo relief or stalling. Stuff happens as it might were the world actually overtaken by demonic appliances. 
Christian Bale, playing the "prophesized leader of the Resistance" John Connor, may have traded in the Batman body armor for "Road Warrior"-style outerwear, but one thing hasn't changed: He is, once again, a movie star playing second fiddle. Heath Ledger stole "The Dark Knight" away from him and Sam Worthington (who will appear in Cameron's "Avatar" this Christmas) heists "Terminator Salvation" from Bale, for the most ironical of reasons: In a movie that poses man against machine, Worthington's cyborg is the far more human character. 
As a steel-beaded logo of Warner Bros. fades away, Marcus (Worthington), on death row for an unexplained crime, gets an 11th-hour visit from Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter), who wears the headscarf and pallor of a terminal cancer patient. She wants Marcus' body -- literally. She wants to turn him into a cyborg. 
Wracked with guilt, resigned to his execution, Marcus agrees to sign the release in exchange for a kiss. "So that's what death tastes like," he says, as she leaves him to his lethal injection. 
This is not your governator's "Terminator." 
Bale, meanwhile, playing the adult version of the hero-to-be portrayed by Edward Furlong ("Terminator 2) and Nick Stahl ("Terminator 3"), is as purposeful and furious as anyone played by Arnold Schwarzenegger or Robert Patrick. One suspects he's been studying Linda Hamilton in "Terminator 2," although -- let's face it -- this is serious business. It's 2018.  Skynet -- the "aware" machine -- has all but accomplished its self-appointed mission of destroying the threat of people. 
But pockets of rebellion continue to operate even if, as in the case of a charred and rubble-strewn Los Angeles, the local contingent consists of just two kids: Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and the mute/cute Star (Jadagrace).   
Kyle --  given a slightly geeky and perfectly plausible portrayal by Yelchin ("Star Trek") -- will grow up to father John Connor after being sent into the past to meet Sarah Connor (if you haven't followed the "Terminator" time line, this is no time to be catching up). 
Thus, he has to be preserved. So does John, given that it's been predicted since 1984 that he'll be the one to save the world. There's a lot at stake. 
McG's direction is always intelligent. (He does seem to have a thing for "The Great Escape," which is referenced several times.)  The script by John Brancato and Michael Ferris occasionally goes off the rails. Certainly, their insertion of an existential dilemma for Marcus -- "I need to find out who did this to me," he says, his chrome-plated plumbing having been exposed to the open air -- feels very late-inning. 
And the obligatory borrowing from the previous movies ("Come with me if you want to live," "I'll be back ...") tend to upset the mood created within McG's bleached-out world, which is very deliberate and doesn't need the comic relief.    
There are great bits though: The thrashing, centipede-like, killer-snake thingie, which has the personality of a wolverine, is a neat invention. So are the biker Terminators, which molt like malignant pinecones off their towering mother �bot. A Schwarzenegger lookalike -- it isn't clear whether it's the ex-actor CGI'd or a complete fabrication -- is funny, but in this case apt. 
Production values are enormous, especially d.p. Shane Hurlbut's work and the visual effects by Industrial Light & Magic, Asylum, Pacific Title and Art Studio, and Matte World Digital. 



Both warning and advertisement, the Terminator  films are technophobic teases, selling tickets by promising this decade's model of killing machine: the classic V8 1984 Schwarzenegger; the bullet-streamlined, liquid-metal '91 Robert Patrick  of T2: Judgment Day ; Kristanna Loken 's 2003 T-X (with burgundy pleather upholstery).
Terminator Salvation , a departure in many ways, is the first Terminator  with no upgrade. The hardware is clanky, and runs on diesel. Schwarzenegger is present only as a CGI mask. The franchise's creation myth—the toppling of humanity by Skynet computers—has finally come to pass. It's 2018—time enough, apparently, for survivors to start dressing like drum circle squatters. Christian Bale 's John Connor  is a maverick officer in the human Resistance. Sam Worthington 's Marcus Wright , last he remembers, donated his body to Cyberdyne before a lethal injection. He wakes to a blasted world, carrying a plot twist familiar to anyone who knows their Philip K. Dick .
To hear director McG  tell it, this is nothing less than Terminator Salvage , a mission to "re-establish credibility" (a/k/a consumer confidence). The obvious models are Chris Nolan 's po-faced Batman s. McG, who started off directing videos for frosted-tip bro bands, is stripping down, getting "dark." He's stricken color from the screen and book-clubbed his cast with copies of The Road . The visuals cite a checklist of 20th-century catastrophes: Worthington, in a Soviet-issue greatcoat, walks a Dresdened L.A.; oilfield fires à la Kuwait darken the horizon; human tissue is harvested in Holocaustic cattle-car roundups. There's even one of those simple nudges at contemporary commentary—"We are not machines, and if we behave like them, then what's the point in winning?"—that industrial-filmmaking liberals honestly believe alchemize entertainment into Art, like lead into gold.
Change was inevitable—the established Terminator  formula has been squeezed dry in FOX's prime-time The Sarah Connor  Chronicles . But among the many things junked in McG's chop-shop is the notion of pleasure: The director describes cutting that "gratuitous moment of a girl taking her top off in an action picture" (God forbid) to get a franchise-first PG-13. He does, however, begin his film with the hook of Worthington clammily kissing a vampire-complexioned, bald-pated Helena Bonham Carter . T3  director Jonathan Mostow , trained on submarine and trucking thrillers, knew he was covering a greasy headbanger classic, not writing scripture. I went to his movie effed up and had a hoot; anyone planning the same for T4  will drop before the credits.
Salvation  rolls along with Marcus on the road, his journey toward Resistance radio transmissions honoring the series' paranoid momentum (The Terminator  actually had more in common with the unstoppable slasher pic than sci-fi mythos). The action set pieces, cut with overdone hectic percussion, are engaging enough. It's when Marcus and Connor intersect—trekking to strike at Skynet's Silicon Valley  nerve center, which looks to be somewhere between Mordor and the Port of Houston —that the movie slackens, with McG tugging at emotional connections he never stuck in place. There's a bit with Worthington smashing a monitor that I realized—with embarrassment as it went into slow-motion—was actually supposed to be cathartic.
The Terminator s have always respected female durability, from commando-mom Linda Hamilton  to T3 's intimation of masculine obsolescence, with effeminized Arnold modeling a pair of Elton John  sunglasses. Salvation  is comparatively anti-girl. Moon Bloodgood 's pilot is introduced shaking a luxuriant mane loose from her flight helmet, making a Jennifer Beals –in-Flashdance  shocka out of something the preceding movies took for granted. She'll later face an arbitrarily staged menace; her would-be rapists are the only yee-hawing rednecks in the movie, though any American Resistance would, realistically, be half Scotch-Irish gun nuts. Bryce Dallas Howard , as Connor's wife, is here just to set up the all-time most convoluted "I'll be back."
But the essential problem here isn't the ladies—or the lack thereof. It's the no-frissons Bale-Worthington pairing. Bale, doing the "Grrr" voice, is a lesson in how clenched effort does not equal effect. What's remarkable about his leaked freakout—mostly embarrassing in revealing a director who can't Alpha up on his set—is that it's over a  performance in McG's "Terminator Salvation."  Did the dude sweat this much over Reign of Fire ? Worthington, half-burying his Aussie accent under gruff bluff, is of the blunt Jason Statham –Daniel Craig  genus, with a bit of Ricky Hatton  thrown in (with Hatton's level of resourcefulness). These Commonwealthers are dull trudgers, all—can we get a tariff?
Judgment Day  alloyed pathos and explosions by matching Arnold's impassivity with Eddie Furlong 's silent film-dolorous reaction shots—for those of a certain age, it's impossible to remember the sentimental gambit of that final thumbs-up without getting misty. Salvation , terminally gray, all macho bark, doesn't do contrasts. This means monotony—as predictable as, when the movie tanks, McG telling an interviewer it was "too dark" for the multiplex.
