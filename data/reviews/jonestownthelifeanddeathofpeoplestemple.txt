Reverend, seducer, icon of warped Elvis cool, Jim Jones led the creepiest bad trip of the '70s  the mass suicide of 900 of his followers in Guyana. This slipshod doc offers fascinating footage of Jones' silky malevolence (he has the eyes of a perverted hypnotist), and it captures one aspect of the story that has been crucially underplayed: The Peoples Temple congregation was sizably African-American. But when it comes to how those followers turned into a zombie Kool-Aid death cult, Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple  leaves you with more questions than you went in with.

 Correction Appended  The scariest thing about “Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple” is that so many of the followers of Jim Jones, the demented demagogue who led them to commit mass suicide, appear to have been intelligent, idealistic, life-loving people. On Nov. 18, 1978, more than 900 of them died after drinking poisoned Kool-Aid in what this documentary, directed by Stanley Nelson, calls “the largest mass suicide in modern history.”  Two of the five Jonestown residents who resisted Mr. Jones’s call and escaped into the jungles of Guyana after their loved ones died in their arms offer moment-by-moment accounts of this orgy of self-annihilation. The movie includes an audiotape of Mr. Jones urging them to “die with a degree of dignity” rather than “lie down in tears and agony.”  Death, he argued, was not that big a deal; it was just crossing a line. He heralded communal self-destruction as “an act of revolutionary suicide protesting the conditions of an inhumane world.”  This is a movie to make you shudder. How many of us are so desperate for a charismatic leader claiming to have the answers that we will surrender our basic instincts for survival, along with our reason? This film paints a portrait of Mr. Jones, who died with his flock in Guyana, as a man with two faces. The appealing one was that of a trained Pentecostal minister, an idealist with polished oratorical skills. Growing up poor in Indiana, Mr. Jones was sensitive to the plight of African-Americans, and preached racial equality. His son Jim Jones Jr., who appears in the film, boasts of being the first black child adopted by a Caucasian in the state of Indiana.  Especially for Mr. Jones’s poor black followers, the interracial, self-sufficient community he established in Guyana, and before that in San Francisco and in the Redwood Valley of Northern California in the mid-1960’s, promised utopia. In exchange for their life savings, church members happy to work 20 hours a day for the cause were provided comfortable accommodations and given allowances. The documentary has clips of euphoric Peoples Temple celebrations in all three locations.  The other Jim Jones wears the scowl of a paranoid sadist. As a child, this Jim Jones (whose father was an unemployed alcoholic) conducted funerals for dead animals. A social outcast among whites, he found community in the Pentecostal church and preached on the revival circuit. Years later, he performed bogus faith healings.  Declaring that everyone in the community except himself was homosexual, he verbally coerced men and women into having sex with him and afterward told them he did it for them. At the same time, he discouraged liaisons among Temple members, asserting that sexual relationships were selfish and took away from the focus of the church.  One New Year’s Eve in California, he rehearsed the coming mass suicide by passing out punch to 126 people, then telling them they had just drunk poison and would die together as one. When nothing happened, he said it was a loyalty test.  After the church moved from the Redwood Valley to San Francisco, Mr. Jones became a political force whose support helped elect George Moscone the city’s mayor in 1975. But as the church grew in numbers and influence, Mr. Jones’s paranoia deepened. The night in 1977 that New West magazine went to press with an exposé of Peoples Temple based on defectors’ accounts, Mr. Jones fled for Jonestown, which was already under construction.  Some embraced it as a heaven on earth. But Mr. Jones also set up a speaker system through which he broadcast his paranoid ravings 24 hours a day. Before long, anyone who expressed a wish to leave was considered a traitor.  The end came suddenly, right after Leo Ryan, a California congressman, arrived in Jonestown on Nov. 17, 1978, to investigate complaints from constituents whose relatives had moved there. When Mr. Jones learned that several residents wanted to return with him to the United States, chaos erupted. As Representative Ryan’s plane was about to leave, he was one of five people who were killed on the airstrip. The mass suicide followed on the same day.  In hindsight, it may be convenient to view Jonestown as the most tragic manifestation of 1960’s utopianism run amok, and to imagine that in today’s tougher, more cynical social climate, it couldn’t happen. But as this powerful, minutely documented film reveals, the tragedy wasn’t caused by the failure of the Peoples Temple to realize its goals. In many ways, it was succeeding as a self-sufficient community.  Rather, the horror of Jonestown was caused by people’s willingness to surrender their reason to a madman who was also a charismatic manipulator. And that can happen anytime and anywhere.

Veteran documentarian Stanley Nelson's "Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple"  is an unflashy, straightforward account of Jim Jones and his great social experiment -- which notoriously culminated in the largest mass murder/suicide in modern memory. Interviews with ex-Temple members and the victims' relatives, rare home movies, and film shot on the last fateful day in Guyana make clear the grandeur of Jones' initial vision of racial equality as well as the operatic demagoguery of his ministry's final paranoid stages. PBS-bound docu constitutes a revealing look at a poorly understood chapter in American history. 
Nelson traces the interwoven altruistic and psychopathic aspects of Jones' personality back to his childhood in Indiana, then a KKK stronghold. Neighbors recall a kid from the wrong side of the tracks who, on the one hand, was fervently committed to social justice but, on the other, was wont to stab cats to death before solemnly burying them.
Jones founded an interracial ministry in 1961 in Indianapolis, and, in 1965, he migrated with several members of his congregation to Ukiah, Calif.
Vintage color footage shows congregants building the temple and tilling the soil at the socialist-model commune. In exchange for a 20% tithe (which eventually evolved into the surrender of all of one's possessions), members were assured of clothing, food, shelter and care.
In 1971, Jones moved to San Francisco, where his followers grew into a force for political activism. Television and newsreel clips of marches and rallies, prominently showcasing Jones alongside political candidates, alternate with never-before-seen homemovies of Temple services featuring faith healings by the charismatic leader.
The Peoples Temple relocated to the wilds of Guyana in 1977. The amazingly detailed visual record of the last days of Guyana furnished by the film crew that accompanied Congressman Leo Ryan, though familiar to many, here replays in compressed form both the extraordinary promise of Jones' movement and also its gruesome betrayal.

Werner Herzog  was barely 30 when he made his defining work. Aguirre , Wrath of God  is not just a great movie but an essential one. Herzog's third featurereleased in 1973 and revived at Film Forum in a beautiful new printis both a landmark film and a magnificent social metaphor.
Elaborating on the story of the mutinous conquistador Lope de Aguirre (c.151061), Herzog mythologized history even as he dramatized his own working methods. Aguirre's quest for a nonexistent "golden city" in the heart of the Amazon rain forest  dovetails with the German filmmaker's crazy attempt to recapitulate this venture, producing his own low-budget extravaganza in the same jungle location. (Herzog's El Dorado would have been commercial success; Aguirre , at least initially, achieved only cult status.)
Aguirre  gave Klaus Kinski  his career rolea half-mad actor playing a full-fledged lunaticbut the filmmaker is the protagonist. The opening sequencein which the Spanish expedition, complete with sedan chairs, llamas, and Indian slaves, descends out of the Andes through the cloudsis a spectacular show of cinematic might. The exclamation point is a cannon that explodes as it falls into the river. "The spectacle is real; the danger is real," Herzog later boasted. "It is the real life of the jungle, not the botanic gardens of the studio."
As with all Herzog, fiction is based in documentaryand vice versa. (The movie, which was shot in sequence, purports to be drawn from a fake historical journal.) Landscape is paramount; animals lend their behavioral presence. The camera is exceptionally mobile even as the action is shot midstream on wooden rafts. Each bend in the river compels the spectator to consider how this movie was actually made. Every shot suggests some sort of ordeal, even if it is only hanging out in the Amazon. The on-set tension was legendary. Herzog and Kinski each famously threatened to kill the otherthe Method taken well beyond madness.
Kinski's performance is curdled glam rock. Although he doesn't do much more than project paranoid hyper-vigilance, his posturing commands the screen. (Literally: At one point, he pivots to push a horse out of his way.) "I am the great traitor," Kinski maintains, "I am the Wrath of God," and his guttural screech even sounds like Hitler . His character contrives fake trials and secret executions, expresses an ultimate desire to "forge history," or stage it "like the others stage plays," and leads his men to destruction. Even as Herzog worked out his own demons, he dramatized imperial conquest and its connection to European fascism. That Aguirre  appeared during the final stages of the Vietnam  War links it to America's jungle madness as well.
As noted by his longtime champion, former Voice  critic Mike Atkinson , Herzog has always been an image-maker others have looted: His vocation is "making movies, not watching them." Herzog's river journey anticipated Coppola's in Apocalypse Now  (another example of auteurist psychodrama); Aguirre  is the influence Terrence Malick 's over-inflated New World  can't shake. Herzog even attempted his own failed Aguirre  remake with Fitzcarraldo , but the earlier film is sui generis. Is Aguirre  an exotic thriller, a swashbuckler, a documentary? Manny Farber  was reminded of "a bad Raoul Walsh  adventure, an episodic paceless film in which you're wondering 'will they make it or not.'" (Then again, he cited its "seething passion.") The meeting between voracious explorers and uncanny aliens approaches science-fiction.
The premise is scary. The tone is absurd. The mood, cued by the lush drone of Popol Vuh's score, is languorous, even trippy. The drama ends in a fever of denialsomeone hallucinates a boat in a tree, someone else dies from a nonexistent arrow. Alone with corpses and monkeys on a raft that drifts in circles as it is circled by the camera, Aguirre is the last man standingranting still, amid the illusion of brute existence.
History repeats itself in the jungle. Ending with mass suicide in deepest Guyana , the story of Jim Jones  and his Peoples Temple  is both the death rattle of '60s utopianism andpredicated on the desire to found a New Jerusalem  in the wildernessa very American saga.
Stanley Nelson 's documentary (and Tribeca Film Festival  prize-winner) touches briefly on Jones's wrong-side-of-the-tracks childhood and Pentecostal background, leaving the viewer to marvel at the determined faith it must have taken to found a racially integrated church in 1953 Indianapolis . Jones's first new world was in Mendocino  where (imagining the region impervious to nuclear fallout) he moved his congregation and set about creating a collective farm founded on socialist rhetoric, black Baptist energy, and fake faith healing.
Peoples Temple relocated to San Francisco in 1974 and there Jones's dogma of "apostolic socialism" and ever-ready battalion of progressive shock troopscheerful oldsters and sincere young 'unssoon endeared him to liberal pols. Despite reports that cult members were subject to physical, psychological, and sexual coercion, Jones was appointed head of the SF Housing Authority by Mayor George Moscone (himself assassinated, along with Supervisor Harvey Milk , 10 days after the Jonestown  massacre).
The "paranoid messiah of a terrorized but devoted congregation," in journalist Charles Krause 's pithy formulation, Jones had already built his jungle settlementand even rehearsed a mass "revolutionary" suicidebefore he felt compelled to flee SF ahead of a New West  magazine exposé. Once in Guyana, Dad (as Jones was called) provided his followers' sole reality, haranguing them daily over the Jonestown PA system. In November 1978, the apocalypse arrived in the person of fact-finding congressman Leo Ryanattacked and murdered as he attempted to return to California. The cyanide-laced Kool-Aid  was distributed the next day.
