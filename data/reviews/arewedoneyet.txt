Suddenly, Ice Cube is the star and producer of what's threatening to become a family-movie franchise. It seems like only yesterday that he rapped, "Now everybody in the world love to go clubbin'/ And after the club it's either breakfast or [expletive]." That Cube is now stuck in the countryside doing home repairs in this charmless sequel to 2005's "Are We There Yet?" is ironic. It's also inevitable.
Cube is now 37 and the married father of four. So for him, some mornings it's just breakfast. But if "Are We Done Yet?" is to be believed, some mornings breakfast ends up all over his Johnny Unitas throwback jersey.
For this second installment, Cube reprises his role as Nick Persons , a likeable Portland, Ore., sports nut. At the end of the first movie, he learned to tolerate his girlfriend's brats. Even though the mother, Suzanne, was and still is played by Nia Long , this qualified as an act of saintliness. Outfitted with miniskirts and luxurious highlighted hair, Long glows in her latest thankless part, looking like somebody En Vogue left behind.
By the time the sequel starts, Nick has replaced his demolished Lincoln Navigator and started a sports magazine. The first cover story is supposed to be an interview with Magic Johnson , whose theaters are no doubt playing this movie. Nick has married Suzanne. But his Flatiron Building-style apartment is too small for him, her, the kids -- Lindsey (Aleisha Allen ) and Kevin (Philip Bolden ) -- and their dog to co exist comfortably. So it's off to the exurbs, which displeases the little ones.
They're both as obnoxious as ever, especially ultra-sassy Lindsey, who's so miffed about the move that she lies down in front of Nick's SUV in protest. That he doesn't hit the gas should win him some kind of peace prize.
But as brainlessly concocted by its makers, "Are We Done Yet?" is far less about the terrors these kids contrive and more about the nightmare of homeownership. Nick and Suzanne (pregnant with twins, by the way) purchase a five-bedroom house -- oh, who are we kidding? It's a chateau, one apparently made of paper. You can't look at a wall without putting a hole in it. Fixing the chandelier that crashes through the dining room table, repairing the dry rot, and restoring the power aren't tasks Nick can handle alone. Though in typical sitcom-dad fashion, he tries.
For comic exclamation and wholesale wackiness, John C. McGinley is brought in for too many scenes as the real-estate agent, contractor, midwife, and more. He always has more bad news about this lemon of a house, and there's something vain and grotesque about the way McGinley wrestles the movie away from everybody with his hamming. He's frequently put in tight clothes or is shirtless for no reason. I can't recall a character performance so predicated upon the camera's needless worship of a fatless body.
This should be a funny role, but McGinley seems so rigidly aware of the camera that it's hard to enjoy him. Jacob Vargas , as a blind plumber, is more effortlessly comical. McGinley's is a Don Knotts part played by a taller, brawnier relative of Richard Simmons . The movie so wants us to like this guy that it gives him a sad story at the eleventh hour, and has Nick, in the middle of a major spat with Suzanne, go off to make nice with McGinley first. Huh?
"Are We Done Yet?" purports to be a remake of the 1948 Cary Grant-Myrna Loy charmer, "Mr. Blandings Builds his Dream House," which also inspired another obtuse remake, 1986's "The Money Pit." The problem with the new film is that Ice Cube is too cool for the plot's nonsense. The faulty house and McGinley's behavior never inspire him to blow his top. We need to feel Nick's frustration, and he needs to be smarter than and visibly exasperated by the escalating craziness. The movie needs Richard Dreyfuss .
It also needs actual escalation. Instead, the woefully uninspired director Steve Carr ("Dr. Dolittle 2," "Daddy Day Care," "Rebound") drags us from one flat, kid-tickling mishap to another, including a fight with a talking raccoon and, later, another with a large fish. But while one critic didn't laugh, some children and a few grownups did, so the movie must count as some kind of success.


         Few experiences skirt closer to the absurdity of farce than the process of remodeling a home. The delirious dislocations of Feydeau have nothing on the moment when your contractor informs you that the cute little faucet you picked up on the cheap will cost a college education to install. Oh, and that wall will have to go.
 
 Excruciating as it is in real life, the comedy of contracting is a dicey proposition on screen as well. It's hard to milk laughs from a couple fearing their future is flowing away one inflated estimate at a time. The best comedy comes from pain, but some wounds never quite heal. Why not pick something less fearsome, like dentistry?
 


         






   In "Are We Done Yet?," Nick Persons (Ice Cube) is chasing two dreams at once: launching a magazine and acquiring the perfect country home. Three if you count the family — wife Suzanne (Nia Long), stepchildren Lindsey (Aleisha Allen) and Kevin (Philip Bolden) — he intends to house in it. Although it reuses the cast of characters from 2005's "Are We There Yet?," "Are We Done ... " began life as a remake of the 1948 Cary Grant comedy "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House," and is far less grating than its ostensible prequel.
 
 Intent on proving his masculine decisiveness, Nick snaps up the sprawling manse from a beguiling  real estate agent (a frisky John C. McGinley) without waiting for a home inspection. And that, as they say, is where his troubles begin. The wood floors have termites, the antique wall sconces have wiring to match, and the vermin won't relocate.
 
 Making matters worse, the  realty agent's favorite general contractor turns out to be himself — and, this being a small town, he also serves as city inspector, issuing hefty fines for substandard work. Anyone who's nursed a sneaking suspicion that home ownership is merely a ruse to separate people from their life savings will be gratified by the confirmation that the forces eating through their home-improvement loans are  in cahoots.
 
 The vast conspiracy mounted against him leaves Nick with little to do but watch as steam emerges from his ears. In "Mr. Blandings ... ," Grant spun dozens of variations on his patented slow burn and still managed only a middling performance, and  1986's "The Money Pit" reduced Tom Hanks to a sour-faced ninny. A likable but limited screen presence, the best Ice Cube can do is open his mouth and blink a lot.
 
 Like Chris Rock's "I Think I Love My Wife," a remake of Eric Rohmer's "Love in the Afternoon," "Are We Done ... " shaves the edges off Ice Cube's abrasive persona. Signaling an intriguing trendlet, both remakes address the overlooked black middle class (or, in Rock's case, upper-middle), signaling a welcome willingness to tap a fresh market (and, less promisingly, a dearth of fresh ideas). But where Rock's film addresses the difficulty of being black and prosperous in the lily-white suburbs, "Are We Done ... " deploys gags involving talking raccoons and shark-size sturgeon, as well as visiting every type of humiliation on Ice Cube's battered frame.
 
 In "Are We There ... ," Ice Cube's confirmed bachelor fully earned the tortures visited on him by his bratty not-yet-stepkids. In "Are We Done ... ," he's more of a born loser, a self-styled tough guy ill-equipped to deal with a new set of problems. Although Ice Cube is still happy to haul out his old snarl when it serves his purposes, he's clearly trying to reinvent himself as a family entertainer. But the milder he gets, the less confident he seems. What's a reformed gangsta rapper to do?
 
 "Are We Done Yet?" MPAA rating: PG for some innuendos and brief language. Running time: 1 hour, 32 minutes. In general release.   

In the atrocious sequel to Are We There Yet? , newly domesticated Nick (Ice Cube) falls off a ladder, the porch, and the second story of his dream house. Moving into a crumbling manse in the country, he jousts with a chipmunk, a raccoon, bats, his oblivious wife, his two unpleasant stepkids, and his nutball contractor (an overcaffeinated John C. McGinley). In no time, Nick is a man enraged  which is Ice Cube's bag. But he shouldn't be allowed to turn so sour and angry in painfully inane family comedies, because here he's moderately terrifying.

 Once again placing his gangsta credentials in serious jeopardy, the rapper Ice Cube returns to the multiplex with “Are We Done Yet?,” an ill-advised sequel to “Are We There Yet?” and a feeble fable of better parenting through home improvement.  Loosely based on the 1948 Cary Grant comedy  “Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House,” this latest addition to the interrogatory franchise finds Nick Persons (Ice Cube) married to Suzanne (Nia Long) and stepfather to her two children. When Suzanne announces she is pregnant (“By who?” asks a startled Nick), the family exchanges his cramped New York apartment for a rural fixer-upper with more problems than square feet.  While Hank Nelken’s slapstick-happy screenplay subjects Nick to countless indignities — including burns, electrocution and attacks by outraged wildlife — Steve Carr directs as though making a very special episode of “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.” Rising above the melee of blind pipe fitters and Hawaiian dry-rot specialists, however, is a marvelous John C. McGinley, playing a dodgy jack-of-all-trades with the kind of energy that forces other actors to step up their game. He is so good that the script’s last-minute gift of a dead wife is completely unnecessary: he redeems his character through acting skill alone.  As for Ice Cube, his transformation from tough-talking rapper to family-friendly entertainer continues. Tempting as it is to inquire, “Are we done yet?” I suspect the answer is no.  “Are We Done Yet?” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has a snarling raccoon, a traumatized deer and a rapacious real estate agent.

"Are We Done Yet?" -- one of the more loaded movie titles in recent memory -- is supposedly based on "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House," but has about as much to do with that frothy Cary Grant confection as a Yugo has to do with a 1948 Buick Roadster. Both are vehicles. Both eventually reach a destination. The question is, what kind of ride are you looking for? Fans of Ice Cube's previous "Are We There Yet?" and his perpetually dyspeptic persona will pile in; others will head in the opposite direction, perhaps on the bus.
Director Steve Carr's updated homeowning-as-nightmare comedy restores Cube to the role of Nick Persons, a man who apparently never heard the old line about making God laugh (How? "Make plans").
Nick recently married Suzanne (Nia Long), a sweetheart with two children (Aleisha Allen, Philip Daniel Bolden), who announces she's pregnant. With twins. They're all squeezed into Nick's old bachelor flat, so they decide, since they have nothing else to do, to buy a house.
Not just a house -- the most spectacular house in Vancouver, on a grassy lawn that seems to roll all the way to the Yukon Territories. Architecturally, however, it's a basket case: dry rot, bad pipes, faulty wiring. Fortunately, local contractor Chuck Mitchell Jr. (John C. McGinley) -- who also happens to be the local real-estate agent, and the building inspector (and a yoga instructor, and a Polynesian fire-dancer) -- is on hand to help.
McGinley, currently committing a similar outrage against restraint in "Wild Hogs," plays Chuck as so sweetly crazy, obnoxious, calculating and over-the-top that, in contrast with Nick's ongoing sourness, he can't help but steal the movie.
It is, however, petty larceny. Helmer Carr relies on the hoariest slapstick -- how often can Ice Cube fall through a floor? The kids come off like little spokesmodels, or aliens, and if not for Long's implausibly patient, good-natured Suzanne, there wouldn't be a recognizably human character in the film (although the crew of blind plumbers is a good joke). For his part, McGinley seems to have just arrived from the Bizarro World version of "This Old House."
Production is predictably slick; the animation sequences are gratuitous. "Are We Done Yet?" has less to do with "Mr. Blandings" than it does with Richard Benjamin's 1986 "The Money Pit," and as any homeowner would say after re-re-shingling the roof, haven't we been there and done that?

One year (in movie time) on from the action of 2005's Are We There Yet? , sports memorabilia salesman Nick Persons  (Ice Cube ) has sold his business, launched a magazine, and moved his newlywed bride (Nia Long ) and two foul-tempered stepkids into his cramped Portland apartmentwhereupon the unexpected arrival of a bun in the oven prompts a relocation to the bucolic countryside and a too-good-to-be-true fixer-upper that quickly proves to be exactly that. Fans of the first film can rest assured that a change in the director's chair has done little to curb the overall tone of slapstick desperation, as the game-faced Mr. Cube does battle with the forces of nature, power tools, and a raft of risible ethnic caricatures. Reportedly, this is all a remake of the popular 1948 Cary Grant  comedy Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream  House , though I'll be damned if I can remember the scene where Grant chased a CGI raccoon across his roof.
