This is the story of Clifford Irving. Born in 1930, the son of a syndicated comic-strip artist; a promising writer at 30, less so at 40; husband to at least four women, illicit lover to God knows how many others; a literary con man and convicted felon who scammed a million dollars out of the McGraw-Hill publishing house and paid for his transgressions with a prison sentence and a poison name. Was there ever a guy whose life was more tailor-made for the movies? The Hoax
 begins with Irving (Gere) in 1970, despondent after a series of critical and commercial failures has left his career in a ditch. He�s desperate for recognition, so he sells his skeptical editor (Davis) on the idea that he�s sitting on �the most important book of the 20th century�: an authorized, tell-all autobiography of famed billionaire and aviator Howard Hughes. Seeing the stunned looks on the faces of the McGraw-Hill executives when they hear the news, one can safely assume that the notoriously reclusive and enigmatic Hughes was the white whale of the publishing business in the 1970s: ungettable and unknowable, a creature of rumor and conjecture whose capture on the page would be worth any pain or price. Of course, Irving never actually met Hughes and was never dubbed his biographer � which would probably pose a problem for most writers. But for a born con artist like Irving, coming up with the idea was the hard part; talking his way to that advance check, forging memos, concocting interview tapes, stealing files from the Pentagon, making up cloak-and-dagger stories, and generally conjuring a life out of thin air? Just a Sunday stroll. Like 2002�s Catch Me If You Can
, The Hoax
 is the story of a life built on lies. Unlike Steven Spielberg�s film, though, which concerned itself almost entirely with the cat-and-mouse game between its two heroes, The Hoax
 follows the thread of all of Irving�s lies, not just the ones that led to the White House or the Watergate Hotel. Because Irving lied to everybody, even when he didn�t need to, and his punishment � much more painful than a year in the pen � was ending up alone. The Hoax
 isn�t Gere�s best movie (that honor will always and forever belong to Days of Heaven
), but it might feature his best performance. Observe him during his boardroom mythmaking sessions, when his eyes begin to light up with possibility and just the hint of a knowing grin curls his lips, and you�ll see the pure joy of a man giving in to his most narcissistic, megalomaniacal instincts. What more could an actor ask for from a role?


In "The Hoax," Richard Gere goes for something different. His hair is dark, thick, and wavy. The moping I usually associate with his acting is gone. So is the smugness I usually assume he mistakes for charm. He's in his late 50s, and only now is he really hitting his stride as a performer. Here, Gere seems as born again as he did during the musical numbers in "Chicago." In fact, the only thing missing from "The Hoax" might be a couple of songs. It's that breezy and fleet a movie.
Gere plays Clifford Irving , the scandalous real-life writer who, in 1971, convinced McGraw-Hill
 to publish his " authorized autobiography " of wacko billionaire Howard Hughes . At the start of director Lasse Hallstr�m's film, Irving is riding high. The company just agreed to publish a novel of his, and he speeds through a blur of scenes, spending the money. Then persnickety senior editor Andrea Tate (Hope Davis ) informs him that the publisher is stopping the presses after one critic calls the book third-rate Philip Roth .
Irving's crushed, but undeterred, barging in on Tate at work and announcing that he's writing the "book of the century." The three yellow-tablet sheets he gives to her are hand written letters from Hughes, explaining, in part, that he wants Irving to tell his story.
None of this is true. Irving forged the letters and has never spoken to Hughes (no one has). But, sensing a blockbuster, Tate and her bosses proceed, anyway, moving past their initial skepticism into a state of bliss known to profiteers as "ka-ching
 ! " and eventually cutting Irving (and Hughes) a check for a million dollars.
What follows is an exuberant farce that Hallstr�m, screenwriter William Wheeler , cinematographer Oliver Stapleton , and editor Andrew Mondshein keep simmering by interweaving comic suspense. When will somebody figure out that this man is a dodger and his book is a fake?
Gradually, of course. But as the noose tightens around Irving, it's his best friend and co-charlatan, Richard "Dick" Suskind (Alfred Molina ), who does all the sweating. These two fall into one illegal, unethical predicament after the next (photographing government documents, stealing classified files, running off to photocopy a Hughes insider's manuscript), and the movie has them bumble from scene to scene like a mutually neurotic Martin and Lewis .
It's undeniably obvious to us that Irving and Suskind are in way over their heads. But Tate and eventually the largely resistant company president (Stanley Tucci ) see what they want to see. At some point, Irving says Hughes has promised to drop by the publisher's offices but needs the place customized per his obsessive demands. Carpet is ripped up, windows covered. It's hilarious watching Tate and her staff race around, breathlessly making the arrangements. It's also extremely sad. We know they're being had. But in the early 1970s, the physical materialization of Howard Hughes would have been a magical event.
"The Hoax" has something in common with "The Illusionist " and "The Prestige" : It's also about a magician's hunger to get away with a ruse. Irving, who is still very much alive, exploited McGraw-Hill's desperation to be wowed. That lust for a good duping was the subject of Orson Welles's enormously clever 1974 documentary "F for Fake," in which the director considered the art of chicanery in part by observing a sharply preserved Irving. For Welles's camera, he was the cool, possessed, and kind of sexy author of a book called "Fake! ," about the notorious art forger Elmyr de Hory . (Gere looks almost every bit like him but plays down Irving's aristocratic air.)
Smartly written as it is, Hallstr�m's movie isn't as assured as Welles's. The film gets bogged down in its final third with some conspiratorial speculation involving Hughes and the Nixon administration. There are also bland asides with Julie Delpy  
as Nina van Pallandt , the Danish baroness-chanteuse and Irving's mistress. She seems like a figment, particularly because Irving's testy German wife (Marcia Gay Harden ) is such a concrete force of (heavily accented) nature. My favorite image in the film is the sight of Harden wearing two wigs at once.
She, Tucci, Davis, and especially Molina are so good they almost excuse the film's lapses. Why is Molina the best-kept secret in movies after all these years? His apprehensiveness in this film is, by turns, funny and poignant, and he brings real comedy out of Gere in a way no actor ever has.
Comedy, of course, is what keeps "The Hoax" interesting. The filmmakers understand what Jonathan Demme captured in 1980's "Melvin and Howard " but Martin Scorsese , in "The Aviator," his own Hughes biography, could not: On screen, Howard Hughes is only as compelling as the men who make him up.



         'The Hoax' is a smart tale about a man who told tall tales.Compared to harsher words like "fraud," "cheat" and "swindle," "hoax" is a rather gentle term, a word that even has artistic implications. It's the word Clifford Irving used to title his book about one of the great deceptions of modern times: his nearly successful 1971 attempt to pass off his own manuscript as the much-coveted autobiography of reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes.
 
 Now, in an act of true poetic justice, a smart new film called "The Hoax" goes Irving one better. Using his book as a starting point and taking advantage of Richard Gere's richest, most mature performance, it has taken off and run with the Hughes-Irving story. The result is an unexpectedly satisfying fantasia of reality and imagination, a meditation on the nature of lies and deception, on how we come to embrace not the truth but what it suits us to believe.
 


         






   Sharply written by William Wheeler and gracefully directed by Lasse Hallström, "The Hoax" is a serious and amusing black farce that does without obvious heroes or villains, an engaging examination — based on facts but not tethered to them — of how a situation can start small and loose and grow colossally out of hand as it takes on a life of its own.
 
 This is pretty much what happened in 1971, when Irving, using forged documents, so convinced New York publisher McGraw-Hill and Life magazine that he had Hughes' actual words in his hands that he was paid an advance of $750,000, real money in those days. Only a telephone news conference by Hughes himself, his first public statement in years and his last ever, derailed the proceedings.
 
 Screenwriter Wheeler has started with these truths and frankly riffed on them to such an extent that Irving has told reporters that he sees the film as "a hoax about a hoax." But, like Irving himself, Wheeler is a great storyteller and "The Hoax" not only deals with the interesting psychological territory where ambition, resentment, delusion and self-interest combine, it also has Irving's gift for making us believe that what is fake is high-proof truth.
 
 It's an indication of the quality of "The Hoax's" script that it has attracted such a strong cast, including Alfred Molina as Irving's friend and co-conspirator; Marcia Gay Harden as Irving's wife; Hope Davis as his loyal editor; Stanley Tucci as his publisher; Julie Delpy as his mistress; even the veteran Eli Wallach in a delicious cameo as Hughes' former associate Noah Dietrich.
 
 "The Hoax" is also something of a rebirth for director Hallström, who has broken free of the earnestness of films like "Chocolat" and "The Cider House Rules" and returned to the affinity for raffish outsiders that marked his early "My Life as a Dog" and "What's Eating Gilbert Grape."
 
 Hallström's relaxed, open attitude and his nonjudgmental interest in the astonishing things people do are major reasons for the success of a film that walks a fine line, agog at Irving's effrontery and nerve but not feeling the need to either lionize or punish him for it.
 
 The role of Clifford Irving would be a plum for any actor, but it especially suits Gere, who was born to play frauds and, in his best "An Officer and a Gentleman"-type parts, brings humanity to otherwise smug, narcissistic and self-absorbed characters. With his air of ever so slightly tarnished charm, Gere is completely convincing as someone who burns with enough resentments to attempt this kind of thing but also likes the idea of pushing the ethical envelope because the truth is simply too dull, too unexciting to keep him interested.
 
 Paradoxically, after an amusing Hughes-involved prologue, "The Hoax" starts with a moment of potential legitimate triumph for this writer. The film's Irving has just handed in a novel that he expects will so fulfill his promise as the next Ernest Hemingway that he springs for a flashy sports car even as his furniture is being repossessed. Clearly, living close to the edge is a pleasure for this man, if less so for his artist wife, Edith (Gay Harden with an eerily effective European accent), still unhappy with her husband's recently concluded affair with the icy socialite Nina Van Pallandt (Delpy).
 
 When that sure-thing book deal unexpectedly goes south, Irving is furious enough, at his publishing house in particular and at powerful men in general, that he comes up with the idea of the make-believe autobiography, a scheme he considers foolproof. Hughes can't sue, he confidently tells pal Dick Suskind (Molina), because "he'll never come out of hiding long enough to denounce me."
 
 From here on, "The Hoax" proceeds on two equally entertaining fronts. We see Irving and Suskind, who turns out to be a demon researcher, in their comic opera endeavors to purloin the material necessary to write the book. Gere and Molina obviously relished their classic Don Quijote / Sancho Panza interaction, which also leaves room for some surprisingly emotional situations.
 
 Irving's other job is convincing the publishing world and the world in general that he has the goods. Like any great fabricator, he uses parts of the truth. Like a riverboat gambler, he ups the ante whenever he is cornered. And like any con man, he counts on how much his marks want to believe what he says to be true. Because people in publishing were desperate for a book likely to "sell more copies than the Bible," everyone tries to will his tall tale into being true.
 
 That tale grows stranger still, involving everything from hallucinations to connections between Hughes and the Nixon White House. It finally becomes so strange that it attracts the attention of Hughes himself, who said in that news conference that "I don't remember any script I ever saw in Hollywood as wild or imagination-stretching as this autobiography yarn has turned out to be."
 
 Odds are, he would have liked "The Hoax's" version even better.
 
 
 "The Hoax." MPAA rating: R, for language. Running time: 1 hour, 56 minutes. In general release.   

The two-bit distortions in A Million Little Pieces  that landed squirming memoirist James Frey on Oprah Winfrey's couch of shame last year were chump change compared with the million-dollar lies served up by Clifford Irving some 35 years ago. Back in 1971, Irving, an unexceptional novelist known best, if at all, for his biography of an art forger, dazzled the fancy New York publishing world with the memoirs he wrung from top secret interviews with legendarily reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes. Only the author never met Hughes. Not once. He made the whole book up, served a prison sentence of 14 months, then went on to write his own memoir about making up the memoir.
Silver-foxy Richard Gere (pictured with Hope Davis) is not the first suave Buddhist I'd think of to play dark, curly, Jewish New Yorker Irving, but the quick-witted Gere who schemes and fast-talks his way around the snappy, plugged-in scam saga The Hoax  is like no Gere I've seen before. (For that matter, creator of Chocolat -coated Hollywood dessert movies Lasse Hallström isn't the first filmmaker I'd think of to exhibit such adult zing, but this is the best thing the director has done since What's Eating Gilbert Grape .) Permed and dyed to verisimilitude, a bit pouchy of build and packed into jackets that mean to look sharp but only look eager to look sharp, Gere takes to the outlandish liar he plays with what might well be called impassioned honesty.
There's no understanding what made Irving do what he did or, indeed, how he managed to get as far as he did  how he sold his brazen blarney to a publisher as upstanding as McGraw-Hill, how he forged Hughes' handwriting, or how he bedazzled and bullied his devoted, needy best friend Dick Suskind (Alfred Molina, reaching greatness in the portrayal of pathos) into participating as researcher and henchman. But Gere is terrific at suggesting the kind of addictive cocktail of excitement, panic, chutzpah, creativity, and naked hunger for fame and megabucks that might inspire such big, fat lies. Marcia Gay Harden, for her part, uses spare strokes to paint a vivid picture of Irving's Swiss-German wife, Edith, who was in on the money shenanigans. Julie Delpy plays Irving's sometime mistress Nina Van Pallandt, who would (in a neat bit of Buddhist karma) later go on to appear opposite the young Richard Gere in American Gigolo .
True facts about Irving's falsehoods are only the starting point here. The Hoax  expands and darkens, in the sophisticated script by under-the-radar screenwriter William Wheeler, to comment on the deception and power games that defined Watergate-era America. Don't forget, while this literary funny business was afoot, the Vietnam War was dragging on under the auspices of a paranoid president who couldn't shake off the unflattering nickname ''Tricky Dick.'' There are lies  or at least fictions, fantasies, and conjectures about Irving   thrown into The Hoax . But the movie's aim is true.

 The literary and journalistic frauds of the present era — the fudgings, thefts and fabulations of James Frey, Jayson Blair, Stephen Glass, Kaavya Viswanathan and their sorry ilk — are small potatoes compared to the work of Clifford Irving. Mr. Blair led readers of The New York Times to believe he’d been to Texas; Mr. Frey convinced Oprah Winfrey and many others that he’d been to jail. But Mr. Irving, back in the early 1970s, conned a major publishing house and a popular magazine into buying a much bigger and more brazen lie.  He told them that Howard Hughes — the words “reclusive billionaire” were not actually part of the man’s name, though they often seemed to be — had appointed Mr. Irving to be his official biographer. Claiming to be in regular contact with his subject, and forging handwritten letters to back up his claim, Mr. Irving pocketed a large advance (some of it meant for Hughes) and produced a manuscript apparently spun out of a mix of careful research, inspired guesswork and pure invention.  All these years later, even as Hughes’s mystique has faded somewhat — nowadays his name is likely to conjure the incongruous image of Leonardo DiCaprio cavorting with Cate Blanchett in “The Aviator” — the audacity of Mr. Irving’s stunt still has the power to astonish. How could he have expected to get away with counterfeiting the life of a living person, especially somebody widely thought to be paranoid, ruthless and more powerful than the government? Lasse Hallstrom’s briskly entertaining new film, “The Hoax,” proposes a few intriguing hypotheses.  The most obvious answer is that the scam was born out of desperation. Mr. Irving, impersonated with hungry, nervous intelligence by a roughed-up, curly-haired Richard Gere, starts out as an ambitious writer who has just seen his big break evaporate. The novel that was going to make his reputation has been summarily killed by the publisher, and to compound the insult Irving has already spent the notional advance on a new Mercedes and a scuba-diving vacation. He has also sworn off philandering, promising to devote himself to his wife, Edith, an artist played by Marcia Gay Harden, sporting a bizarre blond hairdo and an even stranger accent. (Julie Delpy plays the extramarital temptation Irving can’t quite shake.)  The Hughes project is an outrageous bluff that is also, in an odd way,  Irving’s last shot at going straight. You get the sense that he believes not only that it will succeed, but also that the success will be legitimate, making him the esteemed writer and devoted husband part of him longs to be.  His sidekick in the enterprise is a nervous, nebbishy researcher named Dick Suskind (Alfred Molina), who is, at first glance, everything Irving is not. Uxorious, clumsy and a terrible liar, he is both Irving’s reality check and his enabler: If someone as scrupulous and kind as Dick is in on the plot, then it can’t be entirely wrong, can it? And the brilliance of Mr. Gere’s performance — one of his best since middle age liberated his wily charm from his leading-man looks — is that he makes you believe in Irving without believing a word out of his mouth.  Early on, his editor (Hope Davis) passes along a comment dismissing his novel as second-rate Philip Roth, and the dropping of that name, along with Norman Mailer’s later, points toward the literary company Irving aspires to join. He is a brash, macho hustler whose seriousness of purpose is indistinguishable from his chutzpah. Watching him improvise excuses and balderdash for skeptical publishing executives is like watching a poker player shoving all his chips into the middle of the table over and over again. We can see his cards of course, and it’s hard not to root for him to walk away from the table with all the money.  Mr. Hallstrom, now that he has moved on from the somber duties of spinning middlebrow best sellers into high-toned Oscar bait (“The Shipping News,” “The Cider House Rules”), has proven himself to be a nimble filmmaker with a light and subtle touch. His underrated “Casanova,” starring Heath Ledger, managed to be both farcical and subtle, and “The Hoax,” with an excellent script by William Wheeler, achieves a similar complexity of tone. It is for the most part a jumpy, suspenseful caper, full of narrow escapes, improbable reversals and complicated intrigue. But it has a sinister, shadowy undertow, an intimation of dread that lingers after Irving’s game is up.  Some of the shadow is cast by Hughes himself, who appears in old tape recordings and film clips and also in Irving’s creepy impersonations. As he sinks deeper into the autobiography, Irving conducts mock interviews with his subject, for which he puts on a thin mustache and a Texan drawl. At moments he seems to cross the line that separates deception from self-delusion. It’s not quite that Irving believes Hughes is cooperating; rather, he thinks he understands Hughes so well that the latter’s silence is a form of tacit approval.  Mr. Gere’s Clifford Irving, a charlatan and a fool, is also an innocent, blundering into something far bigger and darker than his talent or imagination can contain. Like “Zodiac,” another true story set in roughly the same period, “The Hoax” gestures beyond the particulars of its case toward a pervasive social unease, a sense of ambient danger and disorder that has no clear source or antidote.  The specter of Watergate hovers over Mr. Hallstrom’s picture, which hints at a sticky web of malfeasance and manipulation connecting Hughes with Richard M. Nixon. Irving, for all his big, bragging ambition, turns out to be small fry after all, a petty con man who stumbles into a much bigger game, one where liars are rarely caught, and the really consequential frauds are never fully exposed.  “The Hoax” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and some nudity.

"The Hoax" fearlessly wades through the slippery psychology of a shameless liar -- writer Clifford Irving -- who sold a bogus "autobiography" of Howard Hughes to McGraw Hill and came close to pulling off the publishing scam of the century. Lasse Hallstrom's breezy, fast-paced, somewhat loose-ended account of how he did it offers a surprisingly layered vehicle for a maniacally conniving Richard Gere, backed up by a superb Alfred Molina as his accomplice. Though it marks a much-needed expansion of Gere's repertoire beyond the romantic lead he has continued to play well into his 50s, this complex loser's role marks pic as a marketing challenge for Miramax in U.S. release next April.
Overseas distribs will have to face not just the hurdle of selling a tale about the long-forgotten Irving, but also won't have the comfort of a large-size Hughes myth to draw on. Their only choice will be to present the film on its own irregular merits. On the plus side are a fascinating, stranger-than-fiction story and many tensely comic scenes in a darker second half that breaks into multiple narrative and thematic facets as the film strains to be about not just about a man, but about an era in America, without fully succeeding.
Still, for Hallstrom, this is a move in the right direction after the unhappy trio of "The Shipping News," "An Unfinished Life" and "Casanova," all of which represented a sharp drop-off from the critical and box office success of "Chocolat" and "The Cider House Rules." Here the recipe for combining the director's European free spirit with American storytelling techniques and rhythms is a happier blend, with the added spice of Nixon-era political corruption and a critique of national greed and self-deception.
William Wheeler's script, based on Irving's own tell-all book, which came out after he served a two-year jail sentence for fraud, taps into both Irving's and Hughes' colorful lives. There is more than enough plot to go around, and events race by so swiftly the film demands a good amount of concentration to keep abreast.
It's late 1971, with Vietnam and protest marches dominating the news. But the politically charged times, underscored by newsreels and catchy period music, pass by unnoticed for egocentric, bright-eyed author Irving, about to sell a new novel to McGraw Hill through his icy inhouse publisher Andrea Tate (Hope Davis). When the deal falls through, a crestfallen Irving recklessly blurts out that he is writing "the book of the century," without a clue as to what it is.
Inspiration attaches itself to his foot -- Howard Hughes on a magazine cover -- in the makeshift studio of his wife, Edith (Marcia Gay Harding), a hippie painter of no great talent but deeply in love with her philandering mate. They have reconciled after he broke off with his mistress, the beautiful and amoral European baroness Nina (a comically dippy Julie Delpy.) Thus begins the theme of personal trust and betrayal, which will be skillfully intertwined with the main Hughes plot.
A third thread arrives in the pudgy form of Irving's best friend and loyal researcher Dick Suskind (Molina). Almost as a joke, they start to fantasize about convincing Irving's publishers he's in Howard's good graces and has been chosen to co-author the billionaire's memoirs.
Some of the film's most enjoyable material revolves around Irving's chutzpah and daring in persuading an army of suspicious McGraw Hill suits, headed by a deliciously greedy Shelton Fisher (Stanley Tucci at his understated mightiest).Mistrust farcically battles with raw greed as they eye Irving's forged letters from "Howard," desperately wanting to believe they're real but afraid of being taken for a royal ride.
In the end, greed wins out or, as Irving rationalizes it, "a man who says something completely implausible will always be believed." At every credibility hurdle, he ups the ante, forcing the publishers to pay the unheard-of sum of $1 million to Hughes (i.e., himself) for rights to his story.
Meanwhile, the two lovable swindlers, who are writing up a storm based on illegally procured documents, succumb to panic attacks that have them racing down the McGraw Hill backstairs, followed in their dizzy flight by a vaulting hand-held camera. Though rarely laugh-out-loud comedy, scenes like these roll off the screen like perfectly directed clockwork.
Last part of the film sinisterly suggests Irving was himself the victim of a much larger hoax on the part of the man he was writing about, who used him to force President Nixon to ease antitrust laws and save TWA, which he largely owned. Going even further, it speculates that Nixon's paranoia over what might be in Irving's book motivated the Watergate break-ins.
Gere, his hair cut and darkened like the historical Irving, is strongly on key with the bravado and euphoria of the early scenes, creating a likable rogue whose bloated ego has nowhere to go but down. When reality starts hitting the fan and his lies come back to haunt him, he keeps up a bold front while mentally disintegrating.
Molina is a constantly strong comic note as the red-cheeked researcher who nearly has a heart attack carrying out Irving's wild schemes, yet whose touching faithfulness to his own wife (never seen in the film) contrasts effectively with the wandering of his weak-willed friend. Harden is similarly balanced between a spaciness and her very real feelings of betrayal. They make the most of Wheeler's amusing, down-to-earth dialogue.
There is much in Hallstrom's complex direction that recalls a past master of mirrors and deception, Orson Welles. Apart from the obvious parallel between Hughes' enormous behind-the-scenes power, which rivalled that of the government itself, and that of Charles Foster Kane, another link is Welles' "documentary" "F For Fake," where the real Irving appears telling his story.
Tech work creates a strong feeling for the '70s, with credit going to all hands, but especially to the expressive and varied lensing by Hallstrom's regular cinematographer Oliver Stapleton, and to Carter Burwell's delightful soundtrack, which becomes central in establishing time and mood.

Lest we imagine that the publishing industry went to hell only after James Frey  and J.T. Leroy  clambered on board, here comes Lasse Hallström  to remind us of a literary dustup emblematic of a much earlier nadir for American mendacity. The Hoax  parses the rise and fall of faker Clifford Irving a stalled minor writer who shot to fame when he claimed to have been approached by the notoriously reclusive aviation billionaire Howard Hughes  to write his memoirsas a symptom of that other lying decade, the 1970s.
Though I can't readily summon an American decade that was free of shysters, operators, and runaway gluttons for money and power, The Hoax  is strongest when it connects the dots between Irving, who's played by a wonderfully shifty Richard Gere , and a freshly corporatized book industry. In some of the film's most delicious scenes, glassy-eyed McGraw-Hill  editors and management types (Stanley Tucci , enunciating through contemptuously raised eyebrows) are seen trying to balance their skepticism for Irving's ludicrously transparent whoppers with their longing to sign up a massive bestseller.
Richard Nixon  makes a few guest appearances in grainy archival footage as a murky figure in Hughes's memoirs and by extension, as the top-down polluter of a culture that, according to the movie, made Irving's sensational 15 minutes possible. Still, it seems a bit much to hang this entire paranoid ageVietnam , Watergate, corporate greed, celebrity mania, pointy collars, you name it, they're all bundled in The Hoax on a man who cuts no more charismatic a figure than does his president. William Wheeler , who met with Irving and based his own lavishly embroidered screenplay on the author's post-prison memoir of the affair, found the man affable but "unreadable." That's the classic demeanor of the successful con man, who must be winning and elusive at the same time, and who's always in control of the next move. Gere is a skilled actor with copious experience playing men of fishy motive, but his Irving doesn't seem capable of pulling off the extravagant stunts that kept his seven-figure book deal alive through successive bouts of doubt and suspicion. Indeed, there's something slack, nebbishy, and desperate about this orange-haired upstart when, after publication of his latest work has been canceled, he bursts into the office of his editor (Hope Davis ) to announce his new project. The schemes he hatchespilfering the unpublished manuscript of Hughes's embittered former right-hand man (Eli Wallach ), phoning in a raspy Hughes voice from "the Bahamas " (Westchester  County), and gathering his increasingly disbelieving publishers on a Manhattan rooftop to await the hermit's arrival in a helicopterare the panicky reactions of a man without a plan.
Like all con artists, Irving is a man without a moral core, which is what makes him both seductive and a dangerous betrayer of all those around him, including his good-hearted accomplice (Alfred Molina ) and his endlessly forgiving wife (Marcia Gay Harden ). But the filmmakers can't commit to a full-blooded scoundrel. They want us to like Clifford, sort of, and judge him, a little bit. So they light the movie all wishy-washy for ambiguity, and invest this vaporous fraudster with guilt about his serial betrayalsthe price he pays for continuing to be bad. The most colorful thing about Gere's Irving is his dream life, which makes him no different from the rest of us.
To its credit, The Hoax  isn't glibit doesn't chalk up Irving's moral vacuum to anything a bad mommy or daddy did. But there's no other point of view either; the film suffers a fatal equivocation over whether to frame him as a prankster or an American tragedy. Watching The Hoax , I kept hankering for the antic joie de vivre of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can , which gave itself wholly over to what we love about the con men who dare to slough off the daily grind and do it their way. They have style to burn, and they don't give a damn.
