In Frozen River , the veteran actress Melissa Leo has one of those faces that's all creases and hollows and weather-roughened valleys. As Ray, who lives in a dingy, broken-down trailer home in upstate New York with her two sons (and, when he's around, her louse of a husband), Leo looks as if life has been beating her up from almost the moment she was born. She's desolate, all right, but she isn't weak. Her don't-mess-with-me glare, all bones and sinew, is that of a woman who can't afford femininity, whose existence has been melted down to pure survival. (She's like a Bonnie Raitt  who has been around the block more times than the real one.) I first saw Leo playing a teenage hooker in the grubby little 1985 exploitation picture Streetwalkin&#39;  , and even there (she was in her mid-20s), she had a sullen charge that pierced the film's phony surface. In Frozen River , Leo's acting has a brittle severity and power. Every moment of her performance feels torn from experience, and so does the movie, which finds a suspense in broken lives that are hanging in the balance.
Frozen River , which took the Grand Jury Prize at Sundance  this year, has the festival's imprimatur of social relevance  it's a tale of hardscrabble economic woe  yet as written and directed by Courtney Hunt, the movie is no somber, medicinal downer. It takes the form of a thriller you can believe in. Ray's husband, a gambling addict, has run off to Atlantic City with the down payment Ray had planned to use for a new double-wide trailer home. (To save up, she's been feeding her kids popcorn and Tang.) When Lila (Misty Upham), a Mohawk Indian from a local reservation, tries to steal her car, Ray discovers a moneymaking scheme: The blankly morose and pitiless Lila smuggles illegal immigrants (mostly from China) at $600 a pop, driving them across a nearby frozen river that's an unchecked U.S./Canada border. Ray, weary of slaving away as a dollar-store cashier, agrees to be Lila's driver (she'll attract less attention because she's white), and for everyone involved these trips are perilous potential death rides of hunger and fear. Ray couldn't care less about the people she's transporting; her lack of piety makes the movie sting  and gives it life. So do Ray's run-ins with a local trooper. Frozen River  is a tale of ordinary Americans scraping bottom, yet there's a redemption in that. The film asks: If you were this desperate, wouldn't you do the same?

 Venturing deep into the trenches where hard-working Americans struggle to put food on the table, Courtney Hunt’s somber film “Frozen River” evokes a perfect storm of present-day woes: illegal immigration, ethnic tension, depressed real estate, high gas prices and dire poverty.  The film’s setting, in upstate New York  at the Canadian border, is a gray wintry landscape of mud and slush dotted with trailers and discount stores. Although it is days before Christmas, there is no joy here, and as the movie goes along, its chill begins to seep into your bones.  The closest thing to a social hub is a bingo parlor on the Mohawk reservation that straddles  the frozen St. Lawrence River. Here is where the husband of Ray Eddy (Melissa Leo), the hard-bitten mother of two sons, 15-year-old T. J. (Charlie McDermott) and  5-year-old Ricky (James Reilly), gambled away the family’s meager savings before deserting them, leaving no word.  Ray, who earns a meager wage working part time at the Yankee One Dollar Store, is so destitute she can’t afford Christmas presents. The money her husband squandered was to be used for  the balloon payment on a new double-wide trailer.  Unless she comes up with the money by Christmas, she will lose everything.  If “Frozen River” has all the ingredients for a weepy Christmas story in the tradition of “It’s a Wonderful Life,” it is almost the opposite of that. It is grim reality. But because Ray refuses to give up, she lends the movie nobility. Ms. Leo’s magnificent portrayal of a woman of indomitable grit and not an iota of self-pity makes “Frozen River” a compelling study of individual courage.  She brings the same kind of gravity to the role that Patricia Neal did to Alma Brown in “Hud” 45 years ago. This weathered, redheaded actress makes you believe in her character’s resilience.  As Ray is humiliated in a real estate office and hounded by creditors who threaten to repossess the big-screen television in her shabby living room, you admire her fortitude; her anger never gets the better of her.  Not the least of her problems is T. J., who offers to quit school and take a job. As the de facto head of the household while she is working, he cooks up a telemarketing scam and almost burns down the trailer when he uses his father’s blowtorch to unfreeze the pipes.  The uneasy relations between the Mohawks and the area’s white working-class residents  are embodied by the relationship of necessity Ray develops with Lila Littlewolf (Misty Upham), a glum single mother with a reputation for smuggling illegal immigrants into the United States from Canada. They meet when Ray visits the bingo parlor looking for her husband and catches Lila stealing the car he left behind.  Ray and Lila become smugglers who drive across the frozen river  for meetings  with a sinister, gun-toting Québécois. He hands over illegal aliens from  China and Pakistan who hide in the trunk while Ray drives them over the ice to a remote motel on the other side of the border. At each stop cash is exchanged and haggled over.  Carrying out this risky work, Ray drives with one hand on the steering wheel and the other holding a gun. There is the added lurking fear that the ice may crack. Lila is as desperate as Ray. Her daughter was taken at birth from the hospital by Lila’s mother-in-law, who refuses to hand over the child, whom she wants to raise by herself.  Racism is a fact of life. The state police have a double standard for Indians and whites; a white driver is much less likely to be stopped and questioned. Lila makes no secret of her hatred of whites. Ray has her own ethnic qualms. What if the Pakistanis she is carrying across the border are terrorists?  If “Frozen River” is a social realist film, it has no political axes to grind. It is more interested in exploring the reluctant bond that develops between Ray and Lila than in suggesting any root causes for their situations. When that bond is severely tested, the movie refuses to sentimentalize it.  Ms. Hunt’s eye for detail has the precision of a short story writer’s. She misses nothing, not even the model of the car Ray drives (a Dodge  Spirit) and the supper Ray serves one night when she is out of cash: popcorn and Tang.  “Frozen River” is rated  R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and some violence.

A working mom's efforts to raise cash to buy an upgraded trailer home lead her into a strange netherworld of human smuggling in Courtney Hunt's solid debut, "Frozen River." No trendsetter or breakthrough, this is more than anything else a welcome chance for the fine actor Melissa Leo to finally dominate a film in a terrific and affecting lead role. Sony Pictures Classics acquired the pic at Sundance for under $1 million, spelling limited arthouse biz. 
Pic reps a throwback to an earlier brand of Sundance indie film that combined personal touches, geographical specificity, feminist references and Native American social realism, though none of these factors are so foregrounded that polemics or even politics matter nearly as much as storytelling.
Depiction of the interaction between working poor whites and natives in the Mohawk reservation area straddling the U.S.-Canadian border on the St. Lawrence River, and the underground transfer of illegals from many countries, makes "Frozen River" both unusually local and global in perspective.
After her Mohawk-born and gambling-addicted husband Troy runs out on her, Ray (Leo) is left to take care of teen son T.J. (Charlie McDermott) and younger son Ricky (James Reilly) in a run-down trailer home. She can't make the balloon payment on a new home, and, when she tries to track down Troy at the local bingo parlor, she sees a stranger drive off in his car and gets into a confrontation with her.
Like a set of accidents that begins to feel a bit like intervening fate, Ray learns that this curious Mohawk woman, Lila (Misty Upham), is secretly a smuggler for a ring on the Canadian side of the frozen St. Lawrence run by the threatening Quebecer Jacques Bruno (Mark Boone Junior). Ray at first is manipulated by Lila into doing a run.
Hunt finely balances a subtly staged character study with a tale that grows increasingly tense, so much so that "Frozen River" begins to play like a social-realist thriller. Lila emerges as more sympathetic than she first appears, but Upham's exquisite perf resists telegraphing emotions or what will happen next.
The movie, though, belongs to Leo, a thesp of considerable flinty character and honesty who brings all of her reserves to bear on a big, complex role. Unafraid to show herself weathered by the cold, harsh elements and never working to make auds love her, Leo builds the kind of perf that invites concentration, and then high respect.
Support by McDermott, as a son releasing all of his frustrations on his mom; Boone (partly in French) as the smuggler, and Michael O'Keefe in a wonderful turn as a state trooper, are aces. Production package and vid lensing under tough conditions is quite fine.

When I heard that Quentin Tarantino  handed the Grand Jury Prize for best feature to Courtney Hunt 's Frozen River  at this year's Sundance Film Festival , telling the audience that the movie "put my heart in a vise and proceeded to twist that vise until the last frame," my jaw went slack. A solemn, style-free first feature about two upstate New York  single mothers dragged into smuggling illegal immigrants, Frozen River  stands for everything Tarantino has dismissed as the dulling of American cinema. And on paper, it sure sounds like a sop to the rich people who go to Sundance for their annual weep over poor people.
But Tarantino was raised by his mom, and if there's one thing this movie gets dead right, it's the desperation of impoverished single mothers trying to fend for their children. And if Frozen River  finally gets the terrific actress Melissa Leo  her place in the sun to boot, so much the better.
Like Amy Ryan , Leo has the kind of sharply etched features and hunted eyes that earn a steady dollar playing tough cops, harried spouses, and other working-class women made harsh by harsh living. Best known as Detective Howard, the tough cop who got written out of television's Homicide: Life on the Streets , Leo has never landed a meaty supporting film role like the one that put Ryan on Hollywood 's map, if only for a studio minute, in Gone Baby Gone . If Leo were Charlize Theron  with artfully applied bags under the eyes, an Oscar nomination would surely be forthcoming for her truculent turn as Frozen River 's Ray Eddy , an upstate New York mother of two boys who's abandoned by her gambler husband just as she is about to make a down payment on a prefabricated home.
Ray is prickly, quick on the draw, and difficult to like. No plucky homemaker, she fights with the teenage son (the excellent Charlie McDermott ) whom she's had no choice but to saddle with caring for his toddler brother. She's not above ratting out a tardy female fellow worker in hopes of making assistant manager at the local market. And when she reluctantly teams up with Lila (Misty Upham ), a Native American who tried to steal Ray's husband's car, to ferry illegal refugees across the border, she reveals herself as an instinctive xenophobe, if not an outright bigot.
Hunt is very good at sketching the trailers and dreary bingo halls that these women find themselves in, and shows an astute visual command of the wintry, almost lunar landscape that frames their efforts to survive. But like many first features that began life as shorts and were shot over two weeks with a Varicam, Frozen River  can be ragged viewing. Hunt's a bit free with the thin ice as metaphor and slathered-on pathos, and the movie careens uncertainly between gritty realism, sudden bursts of melodrama, and inspiration. Too many bad things happen, then too many good things, and I took bets with myself on the precise arrival time of the flowering of female solidarity between these two tigresses risking all for their cubs. That it comes on cue in a rushed climax only takes away from Leo's powerfully direct evocation of Ray's aloneness, the way she grows so hard and cold with the grind of trying to survive day in, day out, and her willingness to get what she needs off the backs of others, if necessary.
That Ray's automaton hardness has its limits goes without saying, or Frozen River  would never have been picked up by Sony Pictures Classics . But what sticks in memory isn't the eleventh-hour redemption of Ray and Lila, but the unnerving lack of basic safety that comes with living on the financial edge. For women like Ray, poverty isn't just about money. It's about leaping in desperation into worlds of risk, about endangering themselves, as well as those they love and total strangers, every single day.
