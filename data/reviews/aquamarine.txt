Omigod, you guys! I just saw, like, the cutest movie! It�s based on a YA novel by Alice Hoffman, and it�s about these two total best friends who meet up with � a mermaid! They take her shopping, and they all get streaks in their hair, and they totally help her fall in love with this lifeguard who is really
 fine and never wears a shirt, okay? But you know what? Like, if you read a review of this movie in the newspaper, that person would, like, totally hate it. Because critics aren�t supposed to like movies with shopping mermaids and stuff. If there�s a makeover scene, they walk out, right? Even though this mermaid (Paxton) is really nice, and she�s like a cool big sister, only she has a tail in the water, but she can totally take a sweatshirt and turn it into a halter minidress, and she even takes Claire (Roberts, niece of Julia if that matters) and Hailey (Levesque) to the weirdest place � a vintage store. And while I don�t want to give the ending away, it turns out that the whole movie isn�t even about getting a cute boy to notice you; it�s about friendships between young women and how that�s more important than anything. You know those magazines, like Cosmo Girl
, that are all about how you�re supposed to be coy but not aloof and available but not scary, and it makes being a girl into some impossible paradox of weird stuff that nobody can actually do? The movie totally
 makes fun of that. Oh, and this mermaid can summon dolphins. I know! If my mom saw this movie, she would think it was so goofy. But for what it is, I think it�s pretty okay. It�s not going to win an Oscar or anything. But I liked how it was actually made for tween girls. We never get any movies, and we�re totally growing up too fast anyway. Nobody over the age of 13 would like this movie, but so what? Is being a girl a bad thing? Like, everybody knows what it feels like to have your best friend move away and to feel really, really sad because your parents drowned in a boating accident and you have to live with your grandparents on their beach resort and you don�t have any friends because you live in Florida and everybody is so beautiful and rich and stupid like that mean girl Cecilia (Kebbel), whose dad is the weatherman. I mean, who said that�s any dumber than any of the kazillion movies made for teenage boys? You really have to ask yourself, �Okay, is this better or worse than that The Dukes of Hazzard
 movie?� Because at least this movie has a message for girls besides, like, �If you want something from boys, wear a bikini under a raincoat and act really stupid.� Can you believe Jessica Simpson was almost in this movie? Like, she doesn�t even know what tuna is. I�m so sure she could play a fish.


I'm not a lust-ridden 'tween-age girl, but if I were and a mermaid happened to find her way into my swimming pool, the last thing I'd do is take her shopping and let her steal the boy of my dreams. But I'm catty and shallow. The two best friends in "Aquamarine" are sweet and fair. So when the bubbly Aquamarine (Sara Paxton) winds up in a Florida beach town after a storm, Claire (Emma Roberts, who's Eric's daughter and Julia's niece) and Hailey (the pop singer known as JoJo) try to give her what she wants. Love. Of course, at sundown Aqua's legs turn back into a tail, which means she doesn't have much time to find it.
According to Aqua, her father plans to marry her off to a merman she doesn't love. Dad doesn't believe love exists. She insists it does, and daddy gives her three days to prove it. The boy she picks is Raymond (Jake McDorman), the same permanently shirtless lifeguard Hailey and Claire have been wanting all summer. But if they help a mermaid, they get a wish, and since Hailey is about to move to Australia, they enlist in Project Love and plan to use their wish to stay together.
If I were these two I'd be wishing for filmmaking better than the ABC Family Channel stuff they've got. But 12-year-old girls won't care that some of the overdubbed dialogue in "Aquamarine" makes it seem like a lesser work of Italian neorealism. (The ones who do should write me. I might know some 13-year-old nerds who'd love to watch "Open City" with you.)
Most girls will just be pleased that Alice Hoffman's book has been faithfully adapted, that Roberts has inherited the family's good dental work, that Paxton is like Reese Witherspoon with a tail, and that JoJo is playing someone other than the underage vixen she does in her PG music videos. The town vamp is Cecilia (Arielle Kebbel), the dangerously tan, Mandy Moore-monster who is also in pursuit of Raymond. (He's the only boy in town worth wanting.) Girls will hate her, but if the intended audience is anything like Claire and Hailey, they will come to feel sorry for her, too.
"Aquamarine" is part "Splash" and part "Clueless" (when that dressing-room montage comes hurtling toward you, duck). But girls will know "Aquamarine" is unique because it's the rare movie that fiercely respects the altruistic loyalty that bonds girls to one another. Cute boys Hasselhoffing in slow motion on the sand come and go, but a best friend is forever.

Feet by day, scales by night: As operating systems go, the locomotive options of the title mermaid in the tweener romantic comedy Aquamarine  represent a definite upgrade over Daryl Hannah's more cumbersome machinery in Splash . That's more than can be said about the rest of this movie, a filmy pool of tropes and tchotchkes stereotypically associated with Girls of Today. When Aquamarine (perky-pretty Sara Paxton, her twinkly expressions perfected on the TV series Darcy's Wild Life ) tumbles into the swimming pool of a Florida beach club during a storm, she's all tail. But after she's befriended by trustworthy 13-year-old best friends Claire (Emma Roberts, still answering to the description ''niece of Julia'') and Hailey (Joanna ''JoJo'' Levesque), she reveals her day legs and confides her mission: If she can convince her mythological father  that would be Neptune, King of the Sea  that earthly love is real (in three days), then she can get out of an arranged marriage to an unappealing merman. Aquamarine sets her sights on a cute lifeguard, Raymond (Jake McDorman), and it's still the same old story: Girl meets boy, girl hides fins for fear of rejection, boy can't understand why girl is acting so...fishy.
That's only half the deal in this floppy production, based on a novel by Alice Hoffman and directed in a pink-centric feature debut by Elizabeth Allen. Claire (the fearful one) and Hailey (the rebellious one) have their own girlsville issues. Plus, they're crushing on Raymond too. That everything gets worked out  friendship affirmed, jokes made about silly magazine articles on reeling in a boy  is as sure as the soundtrack's inclusion of a Mandy Moore song.
In such a well-behaved femme aquarium, I'm far more diverted by the antics of the designated Mean Girl , a conniving queen bee called Cecilia. Played with well-honed comic obnoxiousness by Gilmore Girls ' Arielle Kebbel, Cecilia  another lifeguard luster, who wants Raymond for her own boy toy  slithers through her classic bitch role with cheerful sharkiness while Aquamarine  flounders.


Sweet and sprightly in just the right measures, "Aquamarine" is one of the season's pleasant surprises. The high-concept premise -- two adolescent girls befriend a temporarily beached mermaid -- has been fleshed out with inventive wit, unsticky warmth and more than a little wackiness. Result is an unusually likeable family-friendly comedy that could appeal far beyond its target demo of tweener femmes and net a wider audience. Looking downstream, pic likely will make an even bigger splash on homevid.
Working from a novel by Alice Hoffman ("Practical Magic"), scripters John Quaintance and Jessica Bendinger begin their fish-out-of-water scenario by introing 13-year-old best buddies Claire (Emma Roberts of Nickelodeon's "Unfabulous") and Hailey (Joanne "JoJo" Levesque) at summer's end, less than a week before they will be forced to separate. Claire's marine-biologist mom has landed a plum assignment in Australia -- far, far away from their current home in a Florida coastal community where Hailey's grandparents operate an invitingly retro beach club.
Nearly friendless except for each other, the girls literally pray for a miracle to keep them together. Fortuitously, their prayers appear to be answered when a tidal wave triggered by a sudden storm washes a mermaid into the beach club's swimming pool.
Aquamarine (Sara Paxton of NBC's "Darcy's Wild Life") is a blonde, beautiful and bubbly 18-year-old who wants to learn about the habits of surface dwellers. She's especially eager to know about love, a state of grace that her father insists is entirely mythical.
If she can't make Dad see love is real, Aquamarine will be forced into arranged marriage a few days hence with an unappealing merman. Hence, there's an understandable urgency to her trolling for a desirable human who might prove her right and pledge his troth.
Much like the finny femme played so memorably by Daryl Hannah in Ron Howard's "Splash" (1984), Aquamarine is quite capable of sprouting lovely legs to replace her scaly tail. (If she gets wet, however, or stays out past sunset, the tail returns.) But when it comes to mastering the finer points of reeling in a man, the mermaid is out at sea. Not to worry, though: Claire and Hailey are willing to share all they've learned about flirty behavior and feminine wiles from the pages of glossy teen-skewing magazines.
First-time feature helmer Elizabeth Allen demonstrates a light touch and savvy comic chops while smoothly steering the plot toward a beat-the-clock set-up. If Claire and Hailey can help Aquamarine woo a hunky lifeguard (Jake McDorman) -- and get him to say "I love you!" -- the mermaid will grant the girls a wish. Trouble is, time is of the essence. Worse, there's an unscrupulous cutie (Arielle Kebbel) who also longs for the lifeguard.
A few early scenes in "Aquamarine" percolate a tad too insistently with the aggressive quick-cut style of music videos designed to showcase trendy pop tarts. But gradually, almost imperceptibly, pic slows its pace to allow more time for involving character development and gently amusing interaction.
Roberts and Levesque -- who look like real-world 13-year-olds -- develop a credible and compelling relationship with each other, particularly in scenes that touch on the orphaned Hailey's fear of water. Just as important, they provide pitch-perfect reactions as straight women to Paxton, who's by turns impish, anxious and ebullient as Aquamarine acclimates herself to the joys and mysteries of life on dry land.
Paxton's impressive talent for physical comedy serves her character, and pic as a whole, very well.
A large part of pic's charm stems from its relatively daring approach to wrapping up various plot threads in the final reel, as filmmakers take an unexpected (and wholly satisfying) turn toward something like realism. Without getting too heavy-handed with moralizing or message-mongering, filmmakers suggest that gaining maturity and self-awareness may be more important than fantasy-fulfilling happily-ever-aftering.
Supporting players -- including Bruce Spence as a maintenance worker whose spookiness is more apparent than real -- are first-rate across the board. Australia doubles capably for plot's Florida setting. And speaking of trickery: The wizards of the Gold Coast-based JMB FX Studios work seamless magic while sustaining the illusion of Aquamarine's mermaidenhood. Other standout tech contributions include Nelson Coates' evocative production design, Brian Breheny's handsome lensing and Sally Sharpe's aptly colorful costumes.

Mean Girls  meets Splash  in this comedy about two 13-year-olds who befriend a runaway mermaid (Sara Paxton ). She has three days to find true love on land before having to return home and marry her father's choice. The film's true focus is the friendship between the two girls (Emma Roberts  and Joanna "JoJo" Levesque ), although this tends to get lost between Elizabeth Allen 's jittery direction and the screenplay's contrivances. The girls seem too grounded to be the bubbleheaded consumers the film presents them as. And "Just be yourselfminus the tail," as JoJo puts it, is odd advice for Aquamarine 's 'tween audience, whose own defining characteristics are so vulnerable to the pressures of conformity. This movie, in fact, is all about conformity.
