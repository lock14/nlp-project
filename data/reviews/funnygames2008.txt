There's nothing funny about what happens to the Farber family. Ann (Watts), George (Roth), and their adolescent son, Georgie (Gearhart), while off to their upscale country house on summer vacation, fall prey to a pair of immaculately dressed, disarmingly polite psychopaths (Pitt and Corbet), who proceed to mess with the heads of their victims � and the audience � in a very sick way. The result is, well, horrifying. And it's a remake. It's tempting simply to quote, verbatim, my review of Haneke's original, German version of Funny Games
, which blew like a bullet through my skull (and ricocheted just as fast, although with less impact, throughout American theatres) when it was released stateside in 1997 (you can read it here: austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Calendar/Film?Film=oid%3A138006

). But although the games are the same, the arena in which they are played � the world, as viewed through an increasingly skewed, surreal media lens � has changed. If anything, this shiny, new, Americanized take on Haneke's original themes is more effective, more visceral, and far more apparent in its intentions than the original. This "U.S."-tagged doppelg�nger is very nearly a shot-for-shot do-over, and as such it raises the question: "Why?" The answer, once you see the new film, is brutally, disquietingly obvious: Both versions of Funny Games
 comment on the cinematic and, as underscored by Haneke, particularly American conceit of filmed entertainment as substitute for reality and takes it beyond the pale. You can thank the explosion of reality television; the implosion of "real," nonscripted, television news (see Fox News' "fair and balanced" imbalancing act); and our new, best friend the Internet for that. Today's media-saturated "reality" is inching, for the average American, alarmingly close to what Canadian filmmaker/provocateur David Cronenberg predicted with 1983's Videodrome
 (not to mention 1999's eXistenZ
) and which Haneke echoed, from a pre-EU perspective, via Funny Games
. As a media-dominated (or decimated, take your pick) society, we've rocketed way past A Face in the Crowd
, beyond Haskell Wexler's Medium Cool
, and into some creepy, white-hot, prechopped, overshot, stage-managed hyperversion of world and national events. Haneke punctuates his bloody screed with some very freaky exclamatory points � Funny Games
 is not for the faint of heart or those content with their weekly dose of "Must See TV." It's an (arguably) nonexploitive, nightmarish vision of random violence that goes exactly where you don't want it to go and then goes even further. Watts and Roth are maybe bourgeois archetypes of a sort, but that's part and parcel of Haneke's mission. The utterly soulless performances of Corbet and Pitt will sear themselves into your mind and, with any luck, melt off some of the prefab, mundane media muck from your cerebral cortex in the process. You can take a page from Wes Craven before he went flat and keep repeating, "It's only a movie; it's only a movie; it's only a movie." But is it? I told you we'd be discussing this one later.


A friend who works at a local independent cinema recently forwarded me an e-mail from a customer who'd caught a trailer for the upcoming "Funny Games" and was desperate to keep the film from opening at his theater.
The woman had seen enough to know the movie was about two young psychopaths who invade the weekend home of a wealthy family and torture them mentally and physically. She was in a panic that impressionable minds would see the film, that a copycat murder spree might ensue. Her response was to mount the barricades and pronounce NIMBA: Not in My Backyard Arthouse.
The correct response is: Relax, dear lady. Director Michael Haneke abhors mindless cinematic violence as much as you do. He just has a different approach: high-minded shock therapy. With "Funny Games," the filmmaker hopes to attach electrodes to a jaded, thrill-seeking American audience and jolt us out of our bloodlust.
He tried it once before, but it didn't take. The original "Funny Games," made by Haneke in 1997, was a cult sensation in Austria and on the international festival circuit. Wherever it appeared, the film exuded a miasma of dread and left critical punch-ups in its wake. But the director always intended "Games" as a critique of Hollywood violence and our own complacent voyeurism, and so he was holding the mirror up to the wrong audience. With the success of 2005's "Cache (Hidden)," he finally had his entry to America.
Thus this new "Funny Games," a shot-for-shot English-language remake of the original with a few name stars to sucker us into the dark. Naomi Watts (who also executive produced) plays the wife, Ann; Tim Roth, the husband, George; Devon Gearhart is their young son. Arriving at their lake house, they see a pair of young strangers talking with their neighbors, and soon those strangers have invited themselves in.
They are named Paul (Michael Pitt) and Peter (Brady Corbet) - or perhaps it's Tom and Jerry, or Beavis and Butthead. They wear tennis whites and cotton gloves, and they're unfailingly polite even as they're wielding a golf club or loading a shotgun. They have no motive. "Why are you doing this?" asks George. "Why not?" replies Peter.
The games of the title refer to the sadistic mind trips these two play upon their victims over the course of one very long night, but they also extend to the movie and anyone watching it. Each time Paul turns to gaze at us through the camera lens, or wonders who the audience would like to see survive - or, in a key scene, fiddles with the temporal flow of the movie itself - "Funny Games" explicitly asks us: Do you want to play this? Are you sure?
If this is daring in theory, it's a failure in practice. Exactingly well-made, the movie is grueling and unpleasant in the extreme - that's the point - but it's also working from a specious premise, that film-school Brechtian devices can bring on mass enlightenment.
In interviews, Haneke has spoken of making audiences question their own violent urges when they cheer a particularly bloody turn of events. The scene in question doesn't prompt self-examination, though, but anger at the movie itself. The director seems to think an appetite for voyeuristic violence is a recent construct - one he's personally above - when it's actually hard-wired into the human subconscious. (Gore stories go back to "Beowulf" and beyond; the movies just re-create mayhem more faithfully than epic poetry does 
and, yes, the modern entertainment industry caters to that.) The question that should be asked is why.
The director doesn't care why, because "Funny Games" is really about punishing us. There's a prissy academic smugness that renders the 1997 movie more unbearable than anything that happens in it, a smugness mitigated in the new version only through the skill of Watts's performance. She's less of a sheep than the original's Susanne Lothar, and because Pitt's Peter is softer, less arch than Arno Frisch in the first film, the split between cold-hearted farce and sadistic tragedy is less evident. That blunted edge makes for a marginally more watchable movie - probably not what Haneke had in mind.
There may be a way to shock the weekend lemmings into questioning why they go to "Saw" movies, but torturing them for one's own high-minded jollies isn't it. In the end, it's Haneke's refusal to implicate himself that renders the movie infuriating and moot. The tagline on a poster for the new "Funny Games" gives the Euro-snob game away: "You must admit, you brought this on yourself." The ladies at the arthouse would beg to differ, I think. And the people who need to hear it aren't listening.


Can a movie be gripping and repellent at the same time? In Funny Games , a mockingly sadistic and terrifying watch the middle class writhe like stuck pigs  thriller, the director Michael Haneke puts his characters in a vise, and the audience too. I wouldn't recommend Funny Games  to a lot of people, yet I won't dismiss it either. It's been made with brutal fascination and skill, and a kind of sick-puppy suspense. In a wealthy secluded neighborhood, a family of three, staying at an airy summer cottage with perfectly polished white floorboards, are trapped in the house by a pair of preppy psychos who drop by and proceed to tease and torture them. The family, led by Naomi Watts and Tim Roth (with a son of about 10, played by Devon Gearhart), are nice, tasteful, attractive, and pampered; the monsters in tennis whites (and magician's gloves) are like Leopold and Loeb reimagined by Abercrombie & Fitch. They bind, gag, maim, and terrorize, but never lose their bland smiles or impeccable manners. Their real game is power.
At first, one of them (Brady Corbet) comes over to borrow some eggs. He's shy and polite, but on his way out he drops the eggs  an ''accident''  and then he won't leave. Neither will the friend (Michael Pitt) who wanders in through the screen door to join him. Haneke works in cleanly organized shots, with a nagging real-time pace reminiscent of Kubrick. It's a mode that prizes neatness and puts a spotlight on whatever's dirtying up the frame  like, say, a wash of bloody brains in the corner. One of the ghoulish jokes of Funny Games  is that the tormenters are such fresh-faced Aryan preppies they act as if it's the victims who are being rude. They flaunt entitlement, provoking protest, then rage. Smashing the husband's knee with a golf club (no, that's not a spoiler  they're just getting started), they turn torture into a rite of aristocratic privilege. They make the ultimate mockery of WASP manners by punishing the family for failing to live up to them.
Haneke, in films like Benny's Video, The Piano Teacher,  and Caché , has explored the fear and violence that, according to him, flow like poison behind the fake facades of bourgeois life. He's a clever and sophisticated filmmaker; he's also a self-important highbrow Euro pain freak. Funny Games  is a shot-for-shot, line-for-line remake of Haneke's 1997 Funny Games , which was made in Austria and featured Ulrich Mühe (the Stasi spy in The Lives of Others ). The new version is very nearly the same film  with the same scary red credits and screaming-horror heavy metal  but it's perhaps even more shocking to see a glossy star like Naomi Watts trussed up in duct tape.
In an America that treats the Saw  and Hostel  sequels as been-there-dismembered-that  reruns, Funny Games  may sound like a movie a lot of teenagers would call a fun night at the megaplex. In Europe, however, it's an art film. The new version wants to be both. If you enjoy it, Haneke implies, then on some level you're complicit in what it's showing you. By sitting there, you too are helping to turn violence into entertainment. (At several points, Pitt's insinuating ringleader breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience.) Listening to this message, you may be tempted to call the movie's bluff  to say, ''That's not art! It's just torture porn with fancy camera angles!'' But Funny Games  calls your bluff right back, since Haneke has designed it, knowingly, as a lofty exploitation film. Even the niggling implausibilities  couldn't Watts try to retrieve Roth's cell phone? Aren't there more neighbors to run to?  create the B-movie logic of an enclosed hell. The acting is terrific. Pitt and Corbet are lissome creeps, Roth makes you shudder as he reminds you what pain really looks like, and Watts, in the most bravura sequence (a single 10-minute shot), rivets us with her war to survive.
A highly, if grotesquely, skilled exercise in Snuff Guignol, Funny Games  doesn't come out of nowhere. It has many antecedents, from the mocking cool sadism of A Clockwork Orange  to the pressure-cooker intensity of Peckinpah's Straw Dogs  to the house-party torture games of Roman Polanski's 1966 classic, Cul-de-Sac . True, Haneke, like Gaspar Noé in Irreversible , works in a more extreme  and facile  way. Yet he taps into an extreme era; it's hard to deny that he gives good squirm. I'll defend Funny Games  not as a statement (on that level, it's a bit of a crock) but as an experience, a cruelly banal nightmare that held me with its primitive fear factor.

 It is customary to describe film directors who keep a tight rein on their audience’s responses, who coldly and meticulously manipulate emotion, as sadists. Not necessarily in a bad way; filmmaking is to a large degree an art of control. Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and Steven Spielberg can all, with some justice, be accused of sadism, a charge that hardly detracts from — indeed, that helps to explain — the way they provide entertainment.  Michael Haneke, an Austrian auteur who has worked for many years in France, has always been more interested in punishing his audience than in entertaining it. His scrupulously constructed, skillfully made films, many of which have won prizes at leading international festivals, are excruciatingly suspenseful and also, more often than not, clammy and repellent.  It is likely that Mr. Haneke would take the last two adjectives as praise — it’s fine with me if they show up in advertisements — or at least as the acknowledgment of fulfilled intentions. His is an especially pure and perverse kind of cinematic sadism, the kind that seeks to  stop us from taking pleasure in our own masochism. We will endure the pain he inflicts for our own good, and feel bad about it in the bargain.  “Funny Games,” Mr. Haneke’s first English-language film — and a compulsively faithful replica of his notorious 1997 German-language feature of the same title — subjects its viewers to a long spectacle of wanton and gratuitous brutality. So, of course, do countless other movies, though few of them can claim this one’s artistic pedigree or aesthetic prestige. And indeed, the conceit of “Funny Games” is that it offers a harsh, exacting critique of vulgar, violent amusements, a kind of homeopathic treatment for a public numbed and besotted by the casual consumption of images of suffering. That the new version takes place in America is part of the point, since Americans — to a European intellectual this almost goes without saying — are especially deserving of the kind of moral correction Mr. Haneke takes it upon himself to mete out.  Our problem is that we think violence is fun. Well, the fun stops here, people. Ann and George (Naomi Watts and Tim Roth) drive out to the country with their young son, Georgie (Devon Gearhart), towing their lovely wooden sailboat behind their Land Rover and listening to opera CDs. As they settle into their tasteful, gated vacation home, the family is confronted by two well-spoken young sociopaths, who in the course of the following night torment them with a knife, a gun, a golf club and impeccable prep school manners. These fellows variously address each other as Peter and Paul, Tom and Jerry and Beavis and Butt-Head (Leopold and Loeb would have given the game away), and they are played by Michael Pitt and Brady Corbet.  Mr. Pitt, blue-eyed and baby-faced, appears to be the calm, ironical alpha predator, while Mr. Corbet, acting skittish and high-strung, looks like the weaker, crazier one. But that might just be part of the game they and Mr. Haneke are playing, since the whole point of Peter and Paul is that they function without identifiable motive or affect.  When asked by George — his leg smashed, his hands tied, his eyes wide with terror — “Why are you doing this?,” Mr. Pitt’s character responds with answers that parody the kind of facile back story usually applied in cases like this:   unhappy childhood; sexual instability; class resentment; bad education. All of it is facetious, and none of it explains anything.  In his better movies — I admit to a qualified admiration for “Code Inconnu” (2000), “The Piano Teacher” (2001), “The Time  of the Wolf” (2003) and “Caché” (2005) — Mr. Haneke uses extremity and shock to illuminate social and psychological realities, or at least possibilities. His ideas are often facile encapsulations of chic conventional wisdom about the terrible consequences of sexual repression, economic privilege or racial hypocrisy, but his formal dexterity gives these films a creepy power nonetheless.  You may try to dismiss what they are saying (which is basically that you, bourgeois cultural prestige-monger that you are, should congratulate yourself for having purchased a dose of Mr. Haneke’s contempt), but their unsettling effects are not so easy to shake.  To some extent, the same is true of “Funny Games,” which efficiently induces a state of panic and dread, and which features some fine bits of acting, especially from Mr. Pitt and Ms. Watts. The images Mr. Haneke puts on screen (they are shot with crisp,  glossy-magazine elegance by Darius Khondji) are shocking, but they don’t unfold with the usual slasher-movie jolts of grisliness. The camera frequently stands still as the horror unfolds just beyond its range, and when a bloody event takes place, we are likely to be shown the face of a passive witness rather than that of the perpetrator or the victim.  “Why don’t you just kill us and get it over with?” George whimpers. His would-be killer’s reply — “What about entertainment?” — carries beyond the screen, where the voyeuristic masses are implicated in the gruesome spectacle of senseless cruelty. Are we, though? What if the guilt trip never takes off? Or, even worse, what if the American audience, cretins that we are, were to embrace Mr. Haneke’s vision not for its moral stringency but for the thrill of, say, watching Ms. Watts, bound at the ankles and wrists, hop around in her underwear? Who will be implicated then? I started out by calling Mr. Haneke a sadist, but it seems to me that he may be too naïve, too delicate, to merit that designation, which should be reserved only for the greatest filmmakers.  At least with the remade “Funny Games,” Mr. Haneke shows a certain kinship with someone like Eli Roth, whose “Hostel” movies have brought nothing but scorn from responsible critics. (If Mr. Haneke wanted to break into the American market, rather than take solace in the ambivalent embrace of the intelligentsia, he should have undertaken not a remake but a sequel.) The “Hostel” pictures and their ilk revel in the pornography of blood and pain, which Mr. Haneke addresses with mandarin distaste, even as he feeds the appetite for it.  Like Peter and Paul, who wear immaculate white gloves as they go about their awful business, “Funny Games” tries to insulate itself from its own awfulness in the fine cloth of self-consciousness. On a few occasions Mr. Pitt turns to address the audience directly, mocking us for rooting for Ann and George’s survival, deriding our desire for neat resolutions. At these moments, using techniques that might have seemed audacious to an undergraduate literary theory class in 1985 or so, the film calls attention to its own artificial status. It actually knows it’s a movie! What a clever, tricky game! What fun! What a fraud.  “Funny Games” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of graphic, pointless violence.

Funny Games U.S. (U.S. - U.K. - France - Germany - Italy)

Euro helmer Michael Haneke�s almost shot-by-shot remake of his 1997 chiller �Funny Games� is as shocking and deliberately manipulative as the original movie and -- some may reckon -- even more pointless. Transposed from Europe to Long Island, with English rather than German dialogue, the pic is robbed of some of its arthouse distance -- especially for Anglophone auds -- and inevitably stands comparison with other, much more commercial family-in-peril movies. Even with the excellent Naomi Watts to hook more viewers than ever saw Haneke�s first pass, this is still specialty, upscale fare. Warner Independent plans a limited Stateside release Feb. 15.
Unspooled in Cannes� 1997 competition, with almost no advance info but considerable buzz about its violent content, the original pic followed two other arty examinations by Haneke of the relationship between violence and the media (�Benny�s Video,� �71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance�). Film went unprized but immediately launched the German-born, Austrian-raised writer-director into the big league of Euro auteurs.
Despite that, Haneke�s original film remains largely unknown -- especially Stateside -- beyond hardcore art-movie buffs, far less so than subsequent movies like �Cache� or even �The Piano Teacher.� 
Haneke is on record as always having considered the story more an American one than a Euro one culturally. But the original�s quizzical, very European view on screen violence -- and its almost complete lack of U.S.-style redemption or catharsis -- remains unchanged, making the movie a curious experience in its new setting.
Like many pics that purport to take a critical look at violence in the mass media, there�s also the same nagging doubt (as with the original) that the movie also trades on the exploitation it purports to examine. Strip away its high-minded artiness and the remade �Funny Games� manipulates the viewer as much as any more explicit shockfest -- and without delivering any clear point to justify its accumulative distastefulness.
First seen driving to their comfy summer retreat with a yacht in tow, the Farber family is composed of dad George (Tim Roth), mom Anna (Watts) and son Georgie (Devon Gearhart). Stopping by their nearest neighbors, Fred and Betsy Thompson (Boyd Gaines, Siobhan Fallon), in the rich, gated community, they notice the couple has two young male guests and seem curiously distant.
Fred comes around with one of his guests, Paul (Michael Pitt) -- whom he describes as the son of a business associate -- to help George launch his refitted boat. Meanwhile, the other guest, Peter (Brady Corbet), comes to the house to ask Anna if he can borrow some eggs.
First half-hour very effectively trades on the expectation of violence to come, from incongruous details like Paul and Peter both wearing white gloves to the extreme politesse adopted by all the characters, even as the two youths progressively stretch the unwritten rules of social behavior. When George finally cracks and slaps one of them in the face, the �games� begin in earnest.
For many viewers, the story will be completely new (unlike, say, Gus Van Sant�s shot-for-shot remake of �Psycho�), and the twists and turns and shockingly offhand moments of violence (largely offscreen) will carry an initial charge. Problem is, as the film progresses, it becomes painfully clear there�s no real point to the story; what we�re witnessing is a cool, intellectual exercise, as devoid of character and motivation as the two psychos themselves.
Some powerful movies have been made from senseless slaughter (�In Cold Blood�), but Haneke�s script gives the viewer no way into the characters. Pic also tries to have it both ways, supplying the viewer with one brief moment of emotional satisfaction, but then turning that satisfaction against the viewer.
Where the dramatic focus in the earlier version was evenly balanced between husband and wife, here Watts� Anna is unquestionably the main protag. Thesp, who co-exec produced, rises to the occasion with a beautifully judged perf of bourgeois grit that pushes the character as far as the script allows. In Roth�s perf, George comes across as a much weaker figure than in the original.
In the Paul-and-Peter double act, acting kudos are also reversed. Pitt is unctuously evil as Ivy League psycho Paul (far more threatening than in the original), while Corbet is largely his sidekick dunce.
In a curious artistic choice, Darius Khondji�s lensing is drained of any warmth, with cold whites and distilled colors that underline the obvious. Juergen Juerges� lensing of the �97 version made more of the contrast between bright, summery colors and the sense of threat beneath them.
Dialogue is precisely translated from the 1997 film, with the couple�s house an exact replica of the original; running time is a mere four minutes longer. Most notable other change, which introduces a visual distraction not in the original, is to have Watts in her underwear (rather than fully clothed) during the central sequence.   
On print screened at London fest, title was presented as "Funny Games U.S."

That the play must please is the most obvious truism in show business. But what about those aggressive modern works designed to affront the audience? The surrealist chestnut, Un Chien Andalou , was probably the first movie so conceived; it remains one of the successful because its 16 minutes of baffling insult are pithy, inventive, and comic. Austrian filmmaker Michael Haneke 's Funny Games —a scene for scene, if not word for word, remake of the director's 1997 German-language film, also called Funny Games —is none of these.
Briefly described, Funny Games  presents the ultimate bourgeois nightmare. A picture-perfect family retreats to their comfortable, gated, lakeside house and, before there's even time to restock the fridge, find themselves beset by a pair of clownish trespassers. Dressed in tennis whites, the lads swiftly evolve from innocuous preppies to annoying pests to gleeful psychopaths, holding the family captive and torturing them, presumably for our delectation. As Haneke makes clear in his press notes, Funny Games  was always intended for an American audience: "It is a reaction to a certain American Cinema, its violence, its naïveté, the way [it] toys with human beings."
Right on! Funny Game s is not without a certain artistry. An image of one captor idly channel-surfing with his lissome captive bound and gagged on a couch beside the large-screen television set has the bored depravity of an Eric Fischl  bedroom painting. But for all the laughs it pretends to laugh, Haneke's movie is essentially founded on the programmatic denial of catharsis. "I want the spectator to think," he's been quoted as saying—although with regard to Funny Games , his hope seems as touchingly utopian as the notion that an illiterate might teach people to read. (In any case, the American audience whom Haneke seeks to address is less apt to see Funny Games  as a critique of dominant cinema than an argument for personal handguns.)
As enacted by Tim Roth , little Devon Gearhart , and especially co-executive producer Naomi Watts , the family's suffering seems naturalistic enough. They are recognizable people, while their scarifying captors (in this version, Michael Pitt  and Brady Corbet ) are deliberate ciphers who anticipate the implacably murderous, Oscar-winning  joker created by Javier Bardem  in No Country for Old Men . As suggested by their cartoon nicknames (Tom and Jerry, Beavis and Butt-head ), their white Mickey Mouse  gloves, and the fun they have inventing motives for their inexplicable antics—not to mention their occasional asides to the audience—Haneke's villains are blatant textual effects. (As a strict exponent of unpleasure, however, Haneke will permit none of the narrative thrills the Coens provide in their funny games.)
Everything is calculated. Self-consciously manipulating conventions more or less invented by D.W. Griffith  in the days of the nickelodeon, Funny Games  is what a German might call a "devilish trick," or schelmenstreich . But, unlike other prankster showmen—the names Lars von Trier  and Carlos Reygadas  cavort to mind—Haneke is pretty much a humorless pedant. I did admire his adaptation of The Piano Teacher , thanks largely to Isabelle Huppert 's bravura performance, although, reading Elfriede Jelinek 's novel, I was surprised to discover that it was actually comic. Thus, Das Funnygame   is a very severe schelmenstreich . The movie's early emphasis on the family's innocent, time-killing competitions is preparation for the joyless sport Haneke will have with the spectator.
Without ever acknowledging his own sadism, Haneke self-righteously lays his aesthetic and moral cards on the table. The use of music—largely a blast of John Zorn  neo-punk noise—is anything but subliminal. The violence is all imaginary, a factor of clever editing, precise camera placement, and the power of suggestion. Moreover, its sickening escalation is rigorously based on the host family's lack of "manners." The wife loses her temper with the visitors well before anything bad really happens; her husband strikes the first blow; their child fires the first shot. Everything is, of course, returned in spades.
Perhaps these victims deserve their fate. One of the movie's persistent ironies is that the family is a victim of their insistence on bourgeois property rights. Their own toys are inevitably turned against them as weapons: More than once, they are trapped by their own fancy security system. Funny Games  is nothing if not a punitive movie—and once Herr Haneke gets you to admit your own bloodlust, he's got you.
Funny Games  is ultimately about forcing the viewer to confront his or her expectations. Would you enjoy seeing a terrified, helpless, half-naked woman? (The remake's major concession to the American market is a long scene of Naomi Watts hopping around in her underwear; in the original, the wife is clothed.) Are you getting bored? Isn't it about time for something to happen? Do you want to see the worm turn? Or simply wish the movie would end? Professional obligations required that I endure it, but there's no reason why you should.

Rabble-rousing as it often is, Film Forum's new Chinese feature, Blind Mountain , easily fits the paradigm parodied by Funny Games . The difference: This movie actually has a political point.
