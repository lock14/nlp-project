Devotees of the original six-hour BBC miniseries State of Play
, which was created by Paul Abbott and aired in the UK in 2003, could be forgiven for reacting less than enthusiastically to news of an American remake. The original � an adrenalized, all-terrain thriller that ravaged institutions and ideals from Fleet Street to Downing � was television at its finest. Why mess with greatness? Turns out this redo doesn't: It neither embarrasses the original nor is superior to it in any way. But it does
 make a case for its own contemporary relevance by cannily shifting the baddie from Big Oil to a monopolistic private security firm and by introducing into its tale of investigative journalism the rift between print and online. Cal McAffrey (Crowe) is very much legion to the former; he's a rumply, old-school reporter at the fictional Washington Globe
, prickling at new ownership's insistence that A1 stories on sex scandals sell the most papers. The Globe
's Capitol Hill-beat blogger, Della Frye (McAdams), is working on a doozy of one, in fact: the sudden death of a legal researcher (and mistress) to married Congressman Stephen Collins (Affleck), who is currently heading a high-profile investigation into the shady private security firm PointCorp. Cal, who used to be Stephen's college roommate, sniffs a conspiracy in the mix and teams up with Della to connect the dots between a series of murders, the character assassination of the congressman, and PointCorp. (The pervasive evil of PointCorp is unsubtly signified in a number of cutaway shots of helicopters looming, Big Brother-like: Is the airspace of our nation's capital really so cluttered?) The screenwriters � top-line talents Tony Gilroy, Billy Ray, and Matthew Carnahan are all credited � do an impressive job in paring back the story (the investigation itself is almost comically compressed to only a few days), but that leaves little room for character shadings. Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland
) has assembled a cast of professionals such as Crowe, McAdams, and Mirren, who can be guaranteed to do good work no matter what they're in, Bateman, usually stuck with playing prigs, has a deliciously twitchy turn as a dirty PR guy, but there's a giant vacuum sucking up space at the center of the film. Affleck, who already has a facile, forever-frat quality to him (I'd wager it's part of his charm), looks a decade too young to plausibly play Crowe's roommate, Wright Penn's husband, a decorated war hero, and an esteemed congressman. It's a crucial role that calls for a number of about-faces � is he a crusader or corrupt, the used or the user? � and Affleck simply doesn't have the heft to pull it off. Maybe sensing a weak spot, Macdonald shifts his focus almost exclusively to Cal's hunt for the truth. Thematically, the forest gets a bit lost for the trees � there's a fundamental, unaddressed irony in the film's conclusion that I won't spoil here � but there's still an undeniable satisfaction to be had in an intelligently executed thriller. And stay for the credit reel: Macdonald, a former documentarian, does nothing more showy than chart the nuts-and-bolts process of printing, assembling, and distributing that dead horse, the newspaper, but it's a stylistic masterstroke.

Poor Stephen Collins. Not the veteran "Seventh Heaven" actor, but the United States congressman from Pennsylvania, whose woes are at the center of "State of Play," an enjoyably trashy thriller that opens today. Representative Collins (Ben Affleck) has been having an affair with a pretty young staffer who turns up dead, minutes before he's scheduled to lead hearings probing possible corruption by an American defense contractor in Iraq. She had been doing research on the matter but, conveniently, fell in front of a speeding D.C. subway.

No one seems to know whether she jumped or was pushed. But the crazy camerawork and screeching on the soundtrack don't leave much to the imagination: Freddy Krueger did it. Regardless, Collins is in trouble. The world is now talking about his extramarital love instead of the nasty contractor. And his beautiful, beleaguered wife (Robin Wright Penn) has to stand by him during the press conference.

The only person able to help is Cal McCaffrey (Russell Crowe), Collins's college roommate who happens to be a big-deal investigative reporter for the Washington Globe. For some reason, it's Cal who advises the congressman on how to spin this story in his favor. For instance, put the mistress's last lovey-dovey camera-phone message on YouTube. Why pay for Capitol staffers at all?

Cal has devoted his career to getting at the truth  - sorry, The Truth. This time he puts his career on the line to get at what Stephen Colbert might refer to as the ultimate truthiness. Of course, Cal's intimate connection to Mr. and Mrs. Collins amounts to what's typically called a conflict of interest. But Cal's imperious English editor (Helen Mirren) doesn't seem to dwell on that. She's under pressure from the new corporate ownership to print more sizzling stories. Furthermore, The Truth doesn't care about such ethical dilemmas. Neither does this brand of overripe, over-plotted suspense.

"State of Play" has been condensed and recontextualized from a nearly six-hour 2003 BBC miniseries. A sheen of British toniness increased the shock value of the tawdrier developments (how could someone with such crisp diction do that?). The American version uses a screenplay patched together from the contributions of the credited writers  - Tony Gilroy ("Michael Clayton," "Duplicity"), Matthew Michael Carnahan ("Lions for Lambs," "The Kingdom"), and Billy Ray ("Shattered Glass," "Breach"). The result is like an expensive video-store shelf devoted to high-level venality.

If the film has a hero, in many ways it's the print news industry. The movie opens with papers dashing through the presses and closes with a shot of a delivery truck. It's a romance between Hollywood and the Fourth Estate that's almost as old as film itself. Newspapers, the movie argues, are the nasty-old government's watchdog. Without them, it's all Glenn Beck all the time.
So "State of Play" moves between the dais and the dumpster, railing against government corruption and corporate monopolies while putting the veteran newspaperman and his imperiled industry on a timely pedestal. While Collins presses on with his hearings, Cal begins to dig into the dead girl's past, meanwhile turning up unsavory revelations about her and his old friend. He does so armed with the editor-mandated assistance of Della Frye (Rachel McAdams), who writes the paper's saucy Capitol Hill blog but has a thing or two to learn about "real reporting." And learn, she will.

Director Kevin MacDonald keeps Cal and Della moving from one scene of danger to another with the pace of an airport thriller. Were "State of Play" an actual paperback, the only reason to put it down would be to wipe the grease off your hands. A parking lot foot chase between Cal and a relentless contract killer produces the amusing sight of  Crowe holding on to a speeding Volvo for dear life. It's pedestrian but fun, despite itself. You could say the same about the movie.

The material better suits MacDonald's slickness than his previous stab at goosing politics for chills,  2006's Idi Amin horror-show "The Last King of Scotland." The pulpy glee in "State of Play" comes at the expense of a few fictitious dead people as opposed to the slaughter of thousands in "Scotland." The tastelessness is palatable.

A lot of what we see in "State of Play" is comically on loan from elsewhere  - a junkie in possession of key information looks like a refugee from American remakes of Asian horror movies, and the killer could double as an avatar from the first-person shooter game of your choice. The overall lack of subtlety is a riot  - there's even a cautionary production of "Peter and the Wolf" happening in the background during one journalist-politician showdown at a Beltway gala.

Still, it's a pleasure watching this cast make the most  of the material  - Harry J. Lennix as a detective (and incidental ringer for Barack Obama); a hilarious Jason Bateman as a druggy, cheeseball publicist; Jeff Daniels sneering on the Hill; Viola Davis in the coroner's office; David Harbour as an intimidating former soldier; and Barry Shabaka Henley, Michael Weston, and Josh Mostel in the Washington Globe's sleek open-space newsroom. (To whom it may concern: Whatever happens to the Boston Globe, I vote we pack up and move to these offices.)

Affleck, speaking in a fine Philadelphia accent, is very good in the film's silliest role. Tubby and hairy again, Crowe does his best with the righteousness he has to play. McAdams makes a lot of cute faces and does a great deal of obvious snooping. When I got tired of hearing her called Della, I pretended people were saying "Nancy Drew," instead. Even so, it's actually fun watching the journalists put this story together. There's a relish in the actors' faces that gets at the thrill both of breaking news and investigating it.

Through it all, there is Mirren giving everybody hell and putting exasperated comedy into such basic activities as punching the numbers on a telephone. Her character's loose journalism standards are worrisome, and she doesn't appear to do any actual editing  - no ones does, for that matter. If this performance can't save newspapers, it certainly makes them seem like the most entertaining place in the world to work.

The great masculine movie stars don't have to get showy to impose their strength. They can afford to understate it  to let it speak for itself. Clark Gable had his twinkle of sexy mischief, Clint Eastwood has his no-frills squint and rasp, and Russell Crowe has a way of   lowering his head and raising an eyebrow with a bemused simmer at anyone who dares to cross him, as if to say, ''Do you really think you're going to get away with that?''
In State of Play , the excitingly twisty and topical new politics-and-media conspiracy thriller, Crowe's Cal McAffrey, a veteran reporter for the Washington Globe , is the sort  of jaded, slovenly, all-work-and-no-life civic gumshoe  who generally spends a lot of time  at least in movies  mouthing off to his superiors, making a big, blustery show of what a battered knight of the newsroom he is. Crowe plays this standard role not by throwing tantrums but by lowering his voice to a mellow, courtly purr. With his face soft and round, and swathed in a beard and scruffy long hair, the actor may not look in the best of shape, but he uses that bloat merrily, as a way to fake us out. When he squares off with a colleague on the paper, a chirpy blogger (Rachel McAdams) who believes that getting the gossip ''angle'' on the news is the same thing as reporting it, you feel the sting of his warrior's contempt, and also the righteous joy he takes in being the guardian of something larger than himself.
Directed by Kevin Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland ), from   a screenplay by Tony Gilroy, Matthew Michael Carnahan, and Billy Ray that shrewdly compresses and Americanizes the superb 2003 BBC dramatic series, State of Play  spins a thorny tale of political corruption laced with personal sleaze. A young woman, killed when she fell under a Washington, D.C., subway, turns out to be the research aide of Stephen Collins, a congressman played by Ben Affleck with just the right touch of furrowed-brow cardboard nobility. He announces the tragedy at the start of a hearing on the nation's use of private defense  contractors. As he weeps with   ''sincere'' dismay, we look at Affleck and think: What's he covering up?
He's hiding the fact that he was having an extramarital fling with the victim. Their affair provokes a white-hot media frenzy, but McAffrey, who happens to be old buddies with the congressman, senses that there's more to the story. Tangling with his editor, who has grown desperate in the age of dying newspapers (she's played by Helen Mirren, snappish as a piranha), he navigates the adultery scandal by uncovering what the tabloid smoke has shrouded.
Conspiracies are supposed to hit us with the shock of revelation. But when it's revealed, early on, that PointCorp, the film's fictional version of the Blackwater mercenary group, is planting its profiteering tentacles everywhere, we may think we've figured out most of the puzzle. We haven't. State of Play  has enough layers of insidious surprise, as well as tasty characters like an unctuous PR guru played with high theatrical ''decadence''   by Jason Bateman, to keep even a seasoned  political-corruption buff guessing. To get to the bottom of things, McAffrey has to use all of his low cunning, his man-of-the-people contacts (security guards, morgue attendants), and a diabolical gambit involving a videotaped interview employed as bait. What gives his investigation a gripping urgency is that it demonstrates, through the ingenuity and zeal of his every move, how vital the old-fashioned, step-by-step process of hardcore newspaper reporting really is.
The issue of newspapers fighting to stay alive in the Internet era exerts a particularly topical zing in State of Play . It's one of the first journalistic dramas to take up this theme, which arises out of the bickering partnership between Crowe and McAdams (perfectly cast as an ambitious wonkette). More than that, though, the movie's plea for the investigatory relevance of its hero's profession begins, after a while, to blur into the issue of the film's own relevance. If a thriller with the verve, fire, and  yes  the timely substance of State of Play  can't catch on, then movies for grown-ups may well prove to be as endangered as newspapers. A–

 I will admit that I choked up a little at the end of “State of Play.” Not because the story was especially moving — or even, ultimately, all that interesting — but because the iconography of the closing credits tugged at my ink-stained heartstrings. The images are stirring and familiar, though in a few years’ time they may look as quaint as engravings of stagecoaches and steam engines. A breaking, earthshaking story makes its way from computer screen to newsprint. The plates are set, the presses whir, sheaves of freshly printed broadsheet are collated, stacked on pallets and sent out to meet the eyes of the hungry public. Truth has been told, corruption revealed and new oxygen pumped into the civic bloodstream. All that’s missing is a paperboy yelling “extra!” to crowds of commuters in raincoats and fedoras.  Those of us who work in the newspaper business are highly susceptible to the kind of sentimental view of our trade this movie offers, especially when the sentiment masquerades as tough-minded cynicism, which makes us go all dewy and reach for the bottle of rye we keep stashed in the bottom drawer of our battered metal desk. And anyone, in whatever field, who cherishes memories of “All the President’s Men” or “His Girl Friday” will smile when “State of Play,” directed by Kevin Macdonald (“The Last King of Scotland”), now and again hits the sweet spot of the genre.  On the other hand, those who recall the British television mini-series on which this is based, with its unsparing dissection of compromised and arrogant news media, are likely to be a bit dismayed. The narrative has been updated and condensed by a trio of talented screenwriters (Tony Gilroy, Matthew Michael Carnahan and Billy Ray), but what has been lost is less length or context than depth. This “State of Play” is both shallower and muddier than its clear-eyed source.  Russell Crowe, as Cal McAffrey, a scruffy, dogged metro reporter for The Washington Globe, engages in fine snappy banter with Rachel McAdams, whose character has the ultramodern job of political gossip blogger and the ripely old-fashioned name of Della Frye. The two of them are not remotely Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell — nor yet Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman — but there is some fun to be had in watching them lock horns and ultimately join forces in pursuit of the big story.  The near-total absence of sexual tension between them is perhaps a concession to the mores of the modern workplace, but it also allows Cal to be ensnared in a dubious subplot involving Anne Collins (Robin Wright Penn), an old flame who happens to be married to a powerful young congressman who happens to be Cal’s college roommate and best pal. We will get to him in due course — his alleged doings and potential undoing are the motor that drives the movie’s frantic plot, and he is played by Ben Affleck — but let’s linger for another moment in the newsroom, while it lasts.  The battered old Globe has just been taken over by a media conglomerate (a development that only adds to the atmosphere of nostalgia), and the flinty editor (Helen Mirren) harangues her troops to bring in the hot copy that will sell some papers. A series of apparently unconnected events — a double murder in a dark alley; the apparently accidental death of a young congressional staffer; important hearings up on Capitol Hill — bring together Cal and Della, who present an amusing clash of journalistic sensibilities and generational styles.  Cal drives a filthy Saab, works at a desk strewn with papers and books, lives in a cluttered rat hole and takes notes with a pen. Initially he has nothing but contempt for Della, whose insouciant, opinionated approach seems to him to violate every tenet of his noble, ragged craft. She doesn’t even seem to own a pen! Della, naturally, regards Cal as a slow-moving, antediluvian creature marked for extinction. Each has so much to learn from the other. What Della learns, charmingly if none too plausibly, is that some stories lie too deep for blogs and can only truly live on the smudgy, crumply page.  The chance to explore the swiftly changing culture of Web-age journalism is one of several intriguing possibilities that “State of Play” squanders as it makes its jumpy, lumpy way toward a disastrous final plot twist. Della and Cal spar over journalistic ethics and habits, but their arguments carry no real dramatic force. And as their investigation proceeds, the movie uncovers some tantalizing themes that are either trampled or kicked aside. What promises to be a smart, sharp inquiry into the complicated intersection of private vice and political corruption — a vivid essay on the nature of power and the ambiguous pursuit of truth — turns into a superficially clever, self-important and finally incoherent thriller.  Congressman Stephen Collins (Mr. Affleck, wielding a Philadelphia accent as thick and inauthentic as low-fat cream cheese) is digging into the sinister dealings of a mysterious security contractor. When his lead researcher is run over by a train, all kinds of questions begin to pop up on cable television and the blogosphere. Was she sleeping with the congressman? Was her death really an accident? Cal tries to juggle professional duty and the obligations of friendship, and the screenwriters try to manage a blizzard of semitopical allusions while Mr. Crowe and Mr. Affleck allow themselves to be upstaged by top-notch supporting players like Jeff Daniels (as a partisan poobah) and Jason Bateman (as a sleazy D.C. fixer).  Mr. Bateman arrives too late to save “State of Play” from the train wreck of its third act but just in time to interrupt the speechifying with some louche and tasty line readings. And the best parts of the movie are details and atmospherics, which add up to a sense that in small ways, filmmakers come close to getting the story right even if the story itself turns out to be nonsensical.  “State of Play” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some violence, sexual references and swearing — just like a real-life newsroom.

Will "State of Play" be the last feature film to commemorate the physical printing and shipping of a big-city daily newspaper (as it does in almost ennobling fashion behind the end credits)? Is this also the last gasp for movies about crusading journalists, a tradition dating back to the early '30s? Whatever the answers, this efficient, admirably coherent thriller about reporters digging down to where politics and murder meet in Washington, D.C., has a wistful air about it as regards the fourth estate at a time when the profession is dangling by a thread. A tangy Russell Crowe performance and an intriguing story look to produce reasonable B.O. in wide release.
Kevin Macdonald's first big studio feature reps a heavily compressed recapitulation of the bang-up, six-hour 2003 BBC miniseries written by Paul Abbott and directed by David Yates. Widely admired on both sides of the Pond, the original featured gritty London atmosphere, a raft of deftly sketched bit characters and lots of quotidian detail that a streamlined, conventional-length feature simply doesn't have time for, and was sufficiently potent at its core to upset the sitting Labour government.
Shifting the action to recent Washington (with the fumes of the Bush administration still lingering) changes the tenor right off the bat, as does the distinctly Yank lingo penned by a succession of writers: Matthew Michael Carnahan, Tony Gilroy and Billy Ray.
But the setup is the same: A desperately fleeing young man is gunned down on the street, a bicycling witness is also shot and gravely wounded, while, in a seemingly unrelated incident, beautiful young Sonia Baker (Maria Thayer) mysteriously meets her end under the wheels of a subway train.
Sonia worked for rising U.S. Congressman Stephen Collins (Ben Affleck), but circumstances soon force him to admit they were having an affair. If it were as simple as that, he and wife Anne (Robin Wright Penn) would soon be able to put it all behind them in the time-tested Beltway manner. But there is much, much more to the story, as disheveled vet Washington Globe reporter Cal McAffrey (Crowe) and the paper's pert upstart blogger Della Frye (Rachel McAdams) soon realize.
Pic's nostalgia for enterprising, old-time journalism -- the sort immortalized in fast-talking Depression-era Warner Bros. quickies through "All the President's Men," "Zodiac" and many in between -- begins with Cal's diet (Goldfish, double cheeseburgers with chili) and resulting paunch, choice of automobile (a beat-up 1990 Saab), scruffy wardrobe, office-drawer whiskey bottle and rat's nest of a cubicle piled high with yellowing paper. The only things missing are the visor, cuffs and dangling cigarette.
In most circumstances, Cal would let the chips fall where they may, but Stephen was his college roommate and best friend -- at least, until Cal slept with Anne. Nevertheless, Cal offers his old pal PR advice on how to best handle the crisis, but when things begin spinning into uncharted territory, Cal's moral compass proves as unsteady as anyone else's.
A significant new element in this American version is the introduction of a standard-issue corporate villain, PointCorp, a Halliburton-like behemoth with deep ties to the administration. While the presence of such an easy villain may give weight to the journalistic side of things, its conventionality somewhat cheapens the drama.
From the outset, the film acknowledges the threat looming over mainstream journalism, first with the testy condescension with which old pro Cal treats know-it-all Della, and repeatedly with the remarks of editor Cameron Lynne (Helen Mirren) about the commercial pressures brought to bear by the paper's new corporate owners. In fact, Cameron appears so preoccupied she's barely able to function, reduced to pacing and fretting while firing off the occasional nasty zinger. Mirren could no doubt have done much more with the role given the opportunity, but it's been so truncated she can't come close to the marvels Bill Nighy wrought with the same part on TV.
The other role to suffer in comparison is that of Anne Collins, originally played with gusto by Polly Walker. In the earlier telling, she and Cal launch into an irresistible but ill-advised affair part-way through the story. Here, the indiscretion took place in the past but continues to exert an ambiguous but thoroughly unconvincing pull on her. Anne has been far too sanitized and conformed, and she's much too classy a woman to even consider any future with the unwashed Cal.
But Macdonald -- who flashed impressive journalistic chops in his documentaries, notably "One Day in September," and displayed an affinity for politics in "The Last King of Scotland" --  has a real feel for the expose/thriller aspects of the story, and commendably delivers the essentials, cramming a good deal into a little over two hours.
Eschewing trendy mannerisms, he makes sure the complicated action and numerous characters remain clear enough to follow and keeps the backgrounds alive and interesting. Journalistic insiders may get a derisive snort out of newsroom scenes anachronistically crammed with busy, gainfully employed workers, but might at the same time privately relish them as a last hurrah for a vanishing tradition.
McAdams is a lively presence as always, but her role (played in the miniseries by Kelly Macdonald) is devoid of any personal life or backstory, or even of much fluctuating opinion about her professional partner. Affleck has no problem conveying the upright, professional bearing of his politico (played in Britain by David Morrissey), but doesn't offer much more.
There are many juicy supporting perfs, however, beginning with those of Jason Bateman as a spineless PR man pressured into revealing confidential information and Jeff Daniels as a priggish congressman who lapses into knee-jerk patriotism and moral uprightness when threatened.
In the end, though, it's Crowe who must carry the most freight, which he does with another characterization to relish. Still bulky, although not as much so as in "Body of Lies," long-tressed and somewhat grizzled, he finds the gist of the affable eccentricity, natural obsessiveness and mainstream contrarianism that marks many professional journalists. Crowe may always have been a brilliant character actor hiding inside a leading man's body, but with age, the former is coming to the fore, which promises an interesting evolution. Although the role of Cal was played by John Simm in 1993, Crowe's part actually merges two roles from the original, embracing as well another journo played by James McAvoy.
Production designer Mark Friedberg's elaborate office set won't likely be matched anytime soon. Craft contributions are sharp, including Rodrigo Prieto's muted, blue-and-gray-dominated lensing, Justine Wright's crisp, clear-minded editing, costume designer Jacqueline West's character-defining outfits and Alex Heffes' quietly pulsing score.



Kevin Macdonald 's Washington thriller is a bellows designed to puff up the most beaten-down reporter's chest. Compressed from the highly regarded BBC  miniseries first telecast in 2003, State of Play  is an effectively involving journalism-cum-conspiracy yarn with a bang-bang opening and a frantic closer. There are more than a few loose ends left hanging when the case slams shut, but it all makes sense, at least until you have a moment to think about it.
Having replaced Brad Pitt  (who reportedly dropped out in a dispute over the script), Russell Crowe  heads the high-powered cast as an old-school journo—which is to say, a bearish slob with printer's ink in his veins and whiskey on his breath. As his foil, Ben Affleck  plays an eminently presentable congressman, reform-minded but morally compromised, whose young research assistant dies in suspicious circumstances under the wheels of the Washington metro the very morning he's set to open televised hearings into the doings of a Blackwatery defense-contracting megalith. Affleck walks tearfully off the Hill and arrives at Crowe's hovel, blubbering that the reporter is the only friend he's got. Seems unlikely, but it turns out that the two were college roommates—a relationship complicated by a shared romantic interest in the fellow alum who became the congressman's wife (Robin Wright Penn ).
Professional ethics are stretched to the breaking point as conflicts of interest proliferate; the erotic tension gets largely sublimated into Crowe's initially adversarial but ultimately mentoring relationship with the cute young blogger (Rachel McAdams ) on his newspaper's political smarm beat. As unrelated murder cases dovetail, Crowe initiates the bright-eyed blogette into the mystery of MSM shoe-leather reporting. It all leads to a vast conspiracy—although the $40 billion that the corporate baddies hope to realize from privatized homeland security seems a bit chintzy compared to the AIG bailout. Indeed, the crusty, seen-it-all editor-in-chief (Helen Mirren )—who disses Crowe's veteran reporter as a "geezer" and counters his every crazy, brilliant lead with a sniff that "the real story is the sinking of this bloody newspaper"—is singularly unimpressed.
The BBC miniseries had the luxury of character psychology, but, for all its interest in the ambivalent state of affairs that exists between politicians, the press, and the minions of P.R. (Jason Bateman  in an expertly comic turn), State of Play  is mainly an action film. There's no way that a two-hour movie can plumb the depths of these various emotional entanglements—or the tragic dimension shared by the two protagonists, ruined politician and tormented newshound. Affleck adds a dash of righteousness to his character, but Crowe is the sole justice-fighter. Working a half-step ahead of the curiously compliant cops and faced with Mirren's impossible deadlines, he tosses off the line "Yes, we can," as he hustles from the newsroom to do some extreme investigative reporting—that is, the kind where you get shot at by a source. Typically in an underground parking garage.
For journalists, however, the movie's irresistible hook is the death-of-newsprint backstory—which comes complete with a utopian vision of a brave new world in which frisky cyber-snoops are eager Girl Fridays to their typewriting seniors. Although the arch-scold Mirren's anxious diatribes seldom fail to mention that the newspaper has just been purchased and is now under cost-conscious management, we never learn this new boss's identity. (The worldwide conspiracy doesn't go that far into media manipulation.)
State of Play  is a deeply nostalgic movie. During the Depression, it might have been played for screwball comedy; 60-something years ago, it could have served as the basis for a private-eye story. Its heart, however, is in the '70s—the days when political conspiracy was hot stuff, investigative reporters strode the earth like so many grubby colossi, a journalist's greatest allegiance was to follow the story, and the promise of a shared byline was a bond stronger than sex.
