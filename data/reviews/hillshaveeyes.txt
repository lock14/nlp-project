Wes Craven is best known these days as the man behind the inventive Nightmare on Elm Street
 and Scream
 horror film franchises, both of which kicked off with sure-fire, white-knuckle originals only to peter out later on down the line, lamely crawling to their kinda-sorta endings amidst an ever-more-enervating stream of Freddie Krueger one-liners and Kevin Williamson-scripted, self-reflexive winks �n� nudges. For the most part, mainstream filmgoers remain unaware of Craven�s decidedly more chewy early films � the brutal Last House on the Left
 (a sociopathic gaze into Bergman�s The Virgin Spring
, no less) and what remains for many his most subversive and freakishly engaging work: 1977�s The Hills Have Eyes
. That film�s plot was as simple as it was outrageous: An all-American family (i.e., squabbling, miserable) headed to California on an RV vacation is waylaid while passing through the Nevada badlands by a clan of bloodthirsty, cannibalistic mutants who then attack, slaughter, and force their �civilized� mirror image to ever-more subhuman acts of violence, thus obliterating the line between �us� and �them.� Craven�s nuclear family vs. nuclear
 family joke (the unspoken message is that the cannibal clan is somehow the result of all those Cold War nuke tests) is a corker, and this new version takes it to even giddier, more effects-heavy extremes, laying some genuinely gruesome KNB make-up atop what was already a blacker-than-black storyline. Director Aja, who helmed last year�s well-received slasher opus High Tension
, is obviously a fan of Craven�s stripped-down, micro-budgeted original: Aja understands the creepy, unwelcome irony that Craven nailed flat out and he adheres closely to both tone and story. The running gag in both versions is that keeping up with the Joneses leaves everybody a Smith or, at the very least, a Smith & Wesson. Does Aja�s version break any new ground (or graves)? It certainly ought to, since Craven�s original themes � the inherent debasement of the status quo, lingering fears of the Bomb, and dysfunctional families run amok � rang all-too-true three decades ago and are today oscillating as piercingly as a tuning fork lodged in a methhead�s heart (or lack thereof). Simply on genre conventions alone, Aja�s film, which ratchets up the gore while subtly rewiring some of the characters, is a welcome change of pace from much of what�s been passing for horror in Hollywood of late. Levine, here filling Martin Speer�s boots as the �normal� family�s crotchety, ex-cop pop, adds another gleaming notch in the stock of his 12-gauge arsenal of memorable character parts, and Quinlan�s mom fairly reeks of apple pie and soccer practice. Unfortunately, Aja underplays the familial bonds between his Sawney Bean-esque cannibal kin, which lessens the emotional impact of the story considerably. Craven�s original had some freaky-smart �through the looking glass� moments that unnervingly twinned these two sets of summertime doppelgangers while playing them off each other via the kind of grim, unflinching humor rarely spotted outside of the indie cinema world these days. Lacking this kind of wackily transgressive counterpoint, Aja�s version, while a killer ride in its own right, never manages the nagging subtexts Craven so handily injected into the proceedings. It�s a top-notch nightmare, but this time you wake up.


One nuclear family meets another in "The Hills Have Eyes," a giddy and horrifying remake of Wes Craven's '70s cult slasher by the same name.
When a tightknit clan of suburban Americans gets sidetracked on a driving vacation, they wind up stranded in the middle of a desert that secretly crackles with life -- and death. Newly retired detective "Big" Bob Carter (Ted Levine) and his brood drive off the beaten path on their cross-country trip, landing themselves in the middle of a wasteland of abandoned atomic test sites. In the devastated hills lives a family of radiation-mutated, inexplicably cannibalistic savages who terrorize, kill, and eat whatever -- or whoever -- crosses their path. When the blood starts flowing, it's up to Carter's resourceful teenage son, Bobby (Dan Byrd), and neurotic son-in-law, Doug (Aaron Stanford), to keep the monsters at bay and the family together.
Thanks to a new screenplay, written by two young French filmmakers -- Alexandre Aja (who also directs) and Gregory Levasseur, the pair behind the recent "High Tension" -- and production assistance by Craven himself, this "Hills" is a far cry from its cheesy and predictable predecessor. "Gruesome" doesn't begin to describe the horrors that are revealed on-screen here: From complete dismemberment to extreme shotgun violence, Aja & Co. not only pull out the stops on this one, they decimate them. Best (and worst) of all is that the most horrendous of the mutant clan's brutalities take place in broad daylight, leaving the family without much hope or refuge.
Filmed in almost maddeningly sharp digital detail, the goriest of scenes wind up being a nauseating confusion of blood and body parts so gracefully filmed and edited that the ghastly action is as enthralling as it is completely repulsive. Keeping true to its cult-classic roots, Aja's film interrupts the terror to occasionally be profoundly corny: The music swells to grandiose proportions whenever Doug triumphs at some impossible feat, and at one point he actually uses a tiny American flag as a lethal weapon against the nuclear bogeymen.
Despite the truly traumatizing gore, "Hills" is surprisingly artful and, believe it or not, about as much fun as a grisly horror movie can be. It's the kind of extreme fright-fest that inspires an audience's bubbling nervous laughter, one-eye-closed cringing, and probably a pretty shaky call home to mom after high-tailing it out of the theater.

For a few years in the 1970s, horror films occupied their own unhinged, blood-soaked Wild West zone. Made in the shadow of Charles Manson and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , they became low-budget godless nightmares, with the mystical terrors of old shoved aside in favor of redneck cannibals, rusty power tools, girls in cutoffs getting their limbs cut off, and the trés counterculture image of the American nuclear family under siege. I still remember watching The Hills Have Eyes  at a drive-in, and the low-budget grunginess of Wes Craven's 1977 shocker was integral to its effect; it told you that the film came from outside the system, that it was made with a lack of restriction  on violence, and on imagination, too  that big-studio horror didn't share.
The remake of The Hills Have Eyes  is big-studio horror. Set in the New Mexico desert, it features lots of lavish camera movement and dusty compositions out of early Spielberg, plus a nifty, unsettling credit montage of nuclear-test footage set to a corny country song and intercut with brutal shock images of birth defects. (Yes, folks, it's a message movie.) Produced by Craven, The Hills Have Eyes  follows the original closely. A fractious family, whose members include Lost 's Emilie de Ravin and the gifted Aaron Stanford from Tadpole, move to California in a station wagon joined to a camper and, once again, are stranded in the desert by a broken axle and besieged by primitive, slavering beastie-men who live in the rocky hills.
Now, though, the aggressors are nuclear mutants (in the old film, they were just really nasty), and so when they break into the trailer, pin down the pretty blonde, shoot a few people, burn Dad at the stake, and steal the baby, my God, the baby!, some of this is effective in a garish and reductive way, yet the savagery is so stagey that we never quite feel the dogs of anarchy being unleashed.
Part of the shock of the original was the perception, still novel at the time, that a movie character's inner goodness wouldn't save her. Now, after 30 years of slasher films, we expect nice people to die; that, more or less, is what we've paid to see. Where Craven and his director, Alexandre Aja, may have miscalculated is in making the genetically damaged demons, with their flesh-potato foreheads and minimal verbal skills (in the original, one of the creepiest things about the hill hooligans is the way they used walkie-talkies), into monster action figures who take vengeance on the world that created them. They're not scary because they're victims themselves.

 It is not the lucky ones who die first, as the grisly tag line of "The Hills Have Eyes" promises, but rather Beauty, one of two German shepherds belonging to a nice all-American family who thought it would be cute to take the scenic route to California.  Needless to say, the eyes in these hills belong to a clan of angry mutant hillbillies. Dog-hating hillbillies (or cat people?) from the look of poor Beauty, her gut sliced open from neck to tail. As for Beast, her companion, he sets his fangs to throat-gnashing revenge, doing his part to put the gore back in allegory.  Along a diabolical stretch of New Mexico desert, man, dog and subhuman alike will find themselves trapped, poor souls, in that most hellish of genres, the horror-classic remake. Run for the hills! But keep your eyes open. Snobs may balk, purists will be appalled, but this new and exceedingly nasty version of Wes Craven's 1977 cult shocker is awfully good at what it does. And mostly what it does is make you feel awful.  Directed in tense, concentrated jabs by Alexandre Aja, who wrote the screenplay with Gregory Levasseur, the remake establishes a jittery family dynamic as well as the original, making the heroes of the movie just sympathetic enough that it stings when they are plunged into a world of utter nihilism and depravity. This is done with such remorseless élan that Mr. Craven (on hand as producer) must have gone green with envy. Or maybe disgust.  So what if this retread replaces the scuzzy punk-rock angst of the original with a corporate sheen? The 1970's are long gone, and with them the relevant modes of 70's cinema. Every generation calls forth the fright films it needs, horror being the most cathartic and subconscious of genres. The strange truth about this new "Hills," like the reviled 2003 remake of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," is that its chic commercial packaging and market-tested atrocities are just as unsettling as the low-budget barbarism of the original. With torture gone mainstream, it's no surprise that brutality is back in the horror film, albeit with a stamp of approval from the Motion Picture Association and an unrated director's cut heading to the DVD shelves at Wal-Mart.  Further complicating any knee-jerk reaction against this remake as a crass cashing-in on someone else's talent — assuming those knees stop quaking long enough to jerk — is the issue of Mr. Aja's chops. "Hills" confirms the promise of "High Tension," his viciously effective (if compromised) debut. No one else under 30 makes movies this savage — and disturbingly symptomatic.  "The Hills Have Eyes" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). You name it, the movie's got it: rape, immolation, cannibalism, dismemberment, the biting off of a parakeet's head.

While loyalists of Wes Craven's cult pic "The Hills Have Eyes" will no doubt disagree about Gallic horror enfant terrible Alexandre Aja's Craven-produced remake, the rest of the audience will feel bloodied and bruised by the end credits. More brutal and less ingenious than Fox Searchlight's last horror venture, "28 Days Later," pic feels more like a Dimension release and, in that sense, will test Fox's specialized arm's ability to milk every last dime out of a genre item. Opening frame multiplex mob scenes and ancillary gold seem assured.
Aja's breakthrough French slasher pic, "High Tension," has its supporters (including, of course, Craven), but its critics point to a cynical style-for-style's-sake attitude, merciless and inhuman feelings for the film's victims and a weakness for extremely manipulative narrative trickery.
Some of Aja and regular co-screenwriter Gregory Levasseur's worst tendencies, however, are muted by their decision to stick to much of Craven's original story, betraying an unabashed love of the 1977 cult hit.
Yet there's a distinct letdown after an astonishing and unexpected opening section, as if the gravitational pull toward trash-kitsch horror was too much to resist. Surprising intro takes place in a present-day New Mexico (with Moroccan locales subbing) covered in radioactive dust from years of surface nuke testing in the 1940s and '50s. Extreme dread looms as ghoulish killers scamper around the desert.
After a "Dr. Strangelove"-like title sequence that actually mixes nuke test images with Vietnamese babies deformed by Agent Orange, and a creepy few minutes involving a half-crazed gas station attendant (Tom Bower), more conventional action nearly matching Craven's film takes over.
In keeping with new pic's strategy of placing one foot in the nuke-obsessed '50s and one in the present, a family led by retired Cleveland cop "Big Bob" Carter (Ted Levine) en route to San Diego in a Gulfstream camper is both slightly retro and a microcosm of post-9/11 Yanks.
While Bob is a gun-toting Republican, son-in-law Doug (Aaron Stanford) is a wimpy Democrat with a wife, Lynn (Vinessa Shaw), and a baby, Catherine.
Bob's kids Bobby (Dan Byrd) and Brenda (Emilie de Ravin) are, respectively, nerdy and sexy-callow. Mom Ethel (Kathleen Quinlan) is a former "hippie chick" who's now religious.
After stupidly opting for a back road shortcut that results in a tire blowout caused by spikes in the road, the family starts bickering. This delays the first encounter between the clan and the "eyes" in them thar hills--an extended multi-generational family of mutants. Unlike Craven's circle of cave people, who resembled Flintstones intermarried with the Manson family, these horrifically damaged folk are polemically depicted as victims of U.S. Cold War policy.
Besides proving to be a faithful mimic of Craven's filmmaking, Aja pours on the gore. But where Aja's version really leaps beyond Craven's both atmospherically and on the violence scale is in the second hour, which has Doug discovering his inner Rambo as he hunts down the mutants to their hideout in an old government testing "village" (a piece de resistance by production designer Joseph Nemec III), complete with mid-century modern homes, decor and eerie nuke-singed American family mannequins.
Big Brain (Desmond Askew),provides pic's scariest and saddest image. The notion of drawing some sympathy to the savage family appears clever enough; but ultimately, it backfires when ? patriarch Papa Jupiter is seen munching on a battered corpse.
Stanford, a long ways from his "Tadpole" debut, seems to relish Doug's transformation from peacenik to red-eyed revenger, as does the impressive Byrd in a scaled-down, teen version of Doug.
Moroccan-based lensing by Maxime Alexandre is considerably visceral, but it's starkly deprived of New Mexico's unmatchable piercing natural light. As the freaks come out of the hills, ace visual makeup effects artists Gregory Nicotero and Howard Berger take over the film with a cornucopia of anatomical extremities.
Composer team Tomandandy's unnerving atmospheric score reaffirms their ability to create an alternative sound to standard Hollywood music recyclings.

Anyone who remembers the original Wes Craven  film The Hills Have Eyes  (1977), which was and remains a piece of Milwaukee  beer shit, remembers it because (a) they had a memorable fuck-or-puke night at the aging neighborhood drive-in; (b) Michael Berryman 's uniquely hairless mug, which glared from video store horror sections for decades, sucked them into a rental, and still represents a moldy teenage sense memory; or (c) critic Robin Wood  made the crude quickie seem like essential pop-cult alt-ness. In his infinitely reprintable 1979 essay "An Introduction to the American Horror Film," Wood included Craven's cannibal-redneck-mutant-family bloodbath in his Freudian exaltation of "the return of the repressed," asserting that Hills 's urge-versus-guilt "reflection pattern" is seen in the "stranded 'normal' family besieged by its dark mirror-image, the terrible shadow-family from the hills, who want to kill the men, rape the women and eat the baby."
It's a sweet sell, and accurate enough, although reading Wood is typically more thrilling than watching most of the movies he analyzes. The new, big-budget remake of Craven's film follows the flowchart, and because it can afford to show us things in mucky detail that the original couldn't, ramps up the savagery several notches. French phlebotomist Alexandre Aja who earned his power-tool pay grade with Haute Tension sets up the bickering vacationing clan (ex-cop dad Ted Levine , starchy mom Kathleen Quinlan , an array of baby-faced teens and post-teens) with no particular skill, although in Wood's universe the gun-toting, neocon flavor of the grown-ups would suggest a puzzling sensibility for their opposite numbers. Bloodthirsty, torture-happy, predator Democrats?
Actually, no: The repressed have returned anew, and the evil desert-dwellers are remaindered out of the atomic dustbin of New Mexico bomb testing, complete with still-standing faux villages peopled by fire-scarred mannequins. (The only thing creepier than the tomandandy score is the credits' glimpse of actual fallout mutations.) In the '70s, Craven had no money for elaborate makeup, and Berryman needed none; today, the laughing, growling Pluto-Jupiter family has distended craniums, orc teeth, and misaligned eye sockets. (It remains, however, that to get cast as a drooling, disfigured monster in a movie like this must be, for an actor, the most humiliating of insults. And where is Berryman's obligatory remake cameo?) The innocent are tortured and fondled and killed, the limbs and blood fly in ecstatic torrents, but no amount of sharp ax polls slammed into skulls can surmount the grueling abuse of aimless overacting, whether by Robert Joy 's skinny dental-crisis maniac (aren't we past the brainless notion that radiation poisoning imbues one with superhuman strength?) or by "normal" teen Emilie de Ravin , whose reaction to having most of her family butchered like farm hens is to whine and stamp her feet.
The net effect would be doze-inducing if in fact the Dolby  didn't attempt to wake the dead. Still, why, one wonders, does Craven's quite craven original filmmade for nothing, tasteless as hell, and out for a few bucksget to be read as a Zeitgeisty signification of subconscious cultural stress, while its go-for-broke remake, even more dedicated to its own mercenary greed and ardor for suffering, does not? Or will a next-generation theorist find signification in Aja's mess, perhaps even a Gallic assault on American conservatism and hubris? Hope not; from here, it's simply intended as a gross-out ordeal for teenagers, and as such it's not worth a fart in the wind.
