"Yours, Mine & Ours" is the movie equivalent of a box of generic macaroni and cheese: bland, easily digested, comforting, forgettable. You can feed the whole family on it, and your kids will shrug and thank you and move on. There are worse things than functional cinema.
Directed by Raja Gosnell -- it's a step up from the "Scooby-Doo" movies -- the film's ostensibly a remake of the 1968 Henry Fonda-Lucille Ball comedy of the same name, which itself was pleasant but no great shakes. Really, though, the new "Yours" aims for the sweet spot hit by 2003's "Cheaper by the Dozen," with similarly harried parents surrounded by a whirling maelstrom of cheery, messy kids.
The gimmick here is that the family is mix-and-match, the product of a second marriage between Frank Beardsley (Dennis Quaid) and Helen North (Rene Russo). He's a Coast Guard admiral and widower who has relocated to his home town of New London, Conn., with eight children in tow. She's his old high school sweetheart, also widowed and with 10 
kids, natural and adopted -- plus dogs, cats, rodents, and a large pot-bellied pig that gets more close-ups than anyone else in the film.
Frank's a ramrod, Helen's an earth mother, yet the chemistry's there, and for a while Quaid and Russo give off a lovely middle-age heat. Then the plot kicks in.
His kids call him "Admiral" and run their lives by bosun's whistle; hers are slovenly and creative. The two clans despise each other and plot to break up their parents' blissful union. This may cause a cynical observer to wonder if it's possible for a couple to divorce their own children.
It all ends rosily, of course, and on the way there are slapstick paint fights, cute sight gags -- the kids make a big enough mob to get their own school bus -- and a hint of romantic rivalry between Frank's oldest daughter (Katija Pevec) and Helen's (Danielle Panabaker). As Frank's commanding officer, Rip Torn cruises through on the way to better movies, while diminutive Oscar-winner Linda Hunt ("The Year of Living Dangerously") plays the family housekeeper. She sits back in one scene and pours herself a massive martini, which is probably the most sensible approach to the situation.
Quaid and Russo are pros, and they're immensely likable, even when navigating the trite dialogue of the breakup scenes. Anyway, your children won't care about the old fogies, since the younger cast is made up of faces they know from the WB and Nickelodeon: Drake Bell and Miranda Cosgrove from "Drake & Josh," Miki Ishikawa of "Zoey 101," Dean Collins from "Jack and Bobby." Movies, too: Panabaker was in "Sky High," Pevec and Sean Faris in "Sleepover." These are the stars my kids recognized. No wonder Quaid looks a little depressed.
Throw in a picture-postcard lighthouse for a family home and that photogenic pig, and you've got an acceptable happy meal, no more, no less. Its taste should have just faded by the time "Cheaper by the Dozen 2" arrives in theaters for Christmas.


         In the early '60s a Navy widow named Helen North and a Navy warrant officer, Frank Beardsley, a widower, made headlines when they were married in the mission at Carmel because between them they had 18 children. Their story inspired the delightful and surprisingly sophisticated 1968 comedy "Yours, Mine and Ours," starring Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda. It was expertly directed by comedy veteran Melville Shavelson from a script he wrote with Mort Lachman from a story by "I Love Lucy" stalwarts Madelyn Davis and Bob Carroll Jr. 
 FOR THE RECORD:



         






    "Yours, Mine & Ours" 
—The movie review of "Yours, Mine & Ours" in Wednesday's Calendar section described Dennis Quaid's character as an admiral who moves to New London, Conn., where he is to become the head of its naval academy. Although the real-life man on whom Quaid's character is based was in the Navy, in the movie version he is in the Coast Guard; New London is the home of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy.
 
  Now it has been remade with Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo, whose terrific chemistry and credible relationship are vitiated by Ron Burch and David Kidd's crude, overly broad reworking of the plot to highlight clunky, blatantly contrived knockabout comedy sequences involving the nonstop shenanigans of the 18 kids. Except for those moments when Quaid and Russo have the screen to themselves, the film is weighed down by the heavy hand of Raja Gosnell's direction. Whereas in the original film there was the sense that the humor grew out of real-life situations, the laughs the filmmakers so stridently strive for in the remake are almost invariably triggered by grossly exaggerated and unbelievable situations.
 
  "Yours, Mine & Ours" has Quaid's Adm. Beardsley moving his eight children to his native New London, Conn., where he is to become head of its naval academy. At a 30th high school reunion he runs into Russo's Helen North, his high school sweetheart.
 
  Not only is the spark instantly rekindled between them, but also they swiftly realize that a widower with eight children and a widow with 10 — six of them adopted — are likely to understand and accept each other. Impulsively they elope, much to the surprise and consternation of their children, who do not mesh well. Frank is a loving parent but runs his home like a ship, whereas Helen is a great believer in free expression.
 
  Eventually, the warring Beardsley and the North offspring see the wisdom of joining forces to break up their parents' marriage only to discover that they like each other after all.
 
  Synthetic, strained and noisy, "Yours, Mine & Ours" is a clinker that doesn't bear comparison with the original. Quaid, Russo and others deserve better.

The late 1960s saw a boomlet in wholesome comedies about big blended American families just when the influence of free love (with accessible contraception) was turning the big American family into an endangered species. That explains the back-in-the-day success of The Brady Bunch , but don't look for the same conservative counterprogramming success from Yours, Mine & Ours . Rene Russo stars as Helen, a loosey-goosey widow with 10 kids who marries Dennis Quaid as Frank, a rules-and-regulations-minded widower with eight of his own. (He's a Coast Guard admiral; she's a handbag designer.) The movie, directed with a gym teacher's whistle by Scooby-Doo 's Raja Gosnell, is a contempo soft-focus remake of the 1968 original starring Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda. Problem is, the modern soft edges only accentuate the datedness of the premise. Helen's gaggle now includes six multiculti adoptees, and Frank's now a sensitive type, even in uniform, who holds parenting sacred. Handsome couple, though, especially when Dad takes his shirt off.

 The kiddie wars have commenced. The popularity of "Cheaper by the Dozen" two years ago has sparked the resuscitation of a rival litter of cute-as-a-button rugrats wreaking havoc in the lives of two caring parents. "Yours, Mine & Ours," a remake of the 1968 comedy starring Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda, ratchets up the juvenile population from a dozen to 18, enough to fill a medium-size school bus.  The keepers of the New London, Conn., lighthouse and attached home in which two combined families settle are now Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo. Their characters, Adm. Frank Beardsley, a United States Coast Guard officer, and Helen North, a handbag designer, are former high school sweethearts, both widowed, who reconnect at their 30th high school reunion and marry before consulting their children. Because Helen has 10 kids, including 6 adopted children, and Frank has 8, their sudden marriage is like a merger made without approval from two critical boards of directors.  The movie, which has a one-month window of commercial opportunity before the arrival in theaters of "Cheaper by the Dozen 2," poses a marketing question: is there room for two movies and 30 squabbling children in one holiday season?  To use one of Frank's favorite words, "Yours, Mine & Ours" is a "shipshape" family movie that won't disturb the sleep of the very young audience at which it is directed. To describe the film as so squeaky clean that it makes the Baker family of "Cheaper by the Dozen" look like the Sopranos would be a gross exaggeration. But "Yours, Mine & Ours" is so snug, airtight and insulated from reality that the nice, well-scrubbed "Cheaper by the Dozen" seems almost rambunctious by comparison.  If you scrape away its triple-frosted glaze, "Yours, Mine & Ours" is about opposing styles of child-rearing: one militaristic, the other bohemian, fighting for supremacy under the same roof. After an hour of waffling, the movie comes down very cautiously on the side of militarism. When Frank admits to Helen that  he's not averse to giving an unruly child a gentle swat on the behind occasionally, you can hardly blame him after what he's been through.  Frank has organized his eight into an efficient sailing crew who talk in nautical language as they march around discharging their duties like good little sailors, chirping,  "Aye, aye sir!" when Daddy gives them orders. Helen, who keeps a messy home office and wouldn't touch a hair on her dear ones' heads, is the movie's idea of a hippie mom. Frank mocks her style of child rearing as "free to be you and me"; she flings the term "anal retentive" in his face.  Once the combined families move in together, disharmony reigns. A sailing expedition organized by Frank to achieve unity collapses in chaos. The two clans of children instantly loathe each other. Helen's more sophisticated brood refuses to follow Frank's minutely computed schedules for everything from chores to bathroom privileges. Unanimity is achieved only when the two sides collaborate to break up their parents' marriage.  "Yours, Mine & Ours" is a straight farce in which Frank, a neat freak, becomes the butt of redundant pranks that find him slipping and sliding and landing in buckets of paint and waking up in bed nuzzled by the family's pet pig.  As in "Cheaper by the Dozen," parental responsibilities go head to head with career opportunities. Frank, the heir apparent of the retiring Coast Guard commandant (Rip Torn), is offered a job that would take him away from home. Helen's new line of handbags is a winner.  The movie's population explosion exceeds its capacity to take a thorough census. Among the 18, the only 3 to stand out from the pack are squabbling teenage girls (Katija Pevec and Danielle Panabaker), and Frank's oldest son (Sean Faris). Linda Hunt, as a tart-tongued, martini-swilling housekeeper, flutters around the edges of the movie, her role obviously cut to the bone. Mr. Quaid and Ms. Russo comfortably hold their own amid the madness, and Mr. Quaid accomplishes the unenviable task of making his dictatorial control freak reasonably likable. Think of him as a younger, more macho Steve Martin, a shipshape 50-something hunk with perfect abs.  The movie is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language. 

Although occasionally overzealous in hard-selling its slapstick elements, "Yours, Mine & Ours" ultimately emerges as generally pleasant family-friendly fare. Remake of 1968 Henry Fonda-Lucille Ball starrer has a limited window of opportunity to strike B.O. gold before the Dec. 21 opening of rival extended-family romp "Cheaper by the Dozen 2." But appealing lead perfs by Dennis Quaid and Rene Russo, and relative dearth of similarly squeaky-clean, non-animated pics, should help Paramount release perform at least passing well in the megaplex marketplace before embarking on a long homevid shelf life. 
Updating the '68 scenario credited to Melville Shavelson and Mort Lachman (and loosely based on real-life figures), scripters Ron Burch and David Kidd waste little time in establishing the recycled premise with multicultural embellishments. Widowed U.S. Coast Guard Admiral Frank Beardsley (Quaid) is a loving but strict taskmaster who uses military-style discipline to keep his eight children in line during their many cross-country relocations.
But widowed handbag-designer Helen North (Russo), who comes off as an unreconstructed hippie, takes a far more laissez-faire approach to raising her 10 kids (including a rainbow coalition of adopted Indian, Asian and African-American youngsters).
When they were teenagers, Helen and Frank enjoyed a short-lived romance. Thirty years later, opposites attract again at a high school reunion shortly after Frank moves back to his home base of New London, Conn. Indeed, they're so attracted that they almost immediately join hands in an off-camera marriage -- without informing their offspring beforehand.
Not surprisingly, when they announce the new bonding to their respective broods, the news is not greeted with unbridled enthusiasm.
Since money is never a pressing concern in this kind of sitcom fantasy, Frank and Helen purchase a spacious seaside fixer-upper (complete with its very own lighthouse) to contain their combined families. It's much more difficult, however, for the couple to strike a balance between their wildly divergent child-rearing philosophies. And it's practically impossible for the two sets of children to establish peaceful co-existence.
The only thing the children have in common is their shared dislike of the new domestic set-up. So, of course, they strike a wary truce to sabotage their parents' chances for happily-ever-aftering.
To generate laughs, director Raja Gosnell ("Never Been Kissed," "Big Momma's House") relies heavily on chaotic scenes of noisy squabbling punctuated with paint-tossing, water-hosing and destruction of property. (A pet pig looms altogether too prominently throughout the proceedings.)
Gosnell, however, does not have his actors play their characters as caricatures. Quaid never goes overboard as a Coast Guard lifer who's determined to run a tight ship at home. And while she delivers some of the pic's sappiest dialogue -- "Homes are for free expression!" -- Russo's free-spiritedness never curdles into cloying excess. With little obvious effort, the two charismatic stars use their low-key charm to generate a rooting interest in keeping the couple (and their respective offspring) under the same roof.
(It's worth noting that the original "Yours, Mine & Ours" used the mother's unexpected pregnancy to keep the family united. The remake isn't quite that shameless.)
Given the sheer size of the household, it's hard for any of the many children to grab sufficient screentime to make memorable impressions. Even so, there's stand-out work by Katija Pevec and Danielle Panabaker as stepsisters who take an instant dislike to each other, and Sean Faris as Frank's unapologetically straight-arrow son. (Tim Matheson played the equivalent of the latter part in the '68 version.)
Among the supporting cast grown-ups, Linda Hunt earns a couple of mild chuckles as a caustic housekeeper, but Rip Torn (as Frank's commander) and Jerry O'Connell (as Helen's business rep) are primarily window dressing.
Pic is for the most part a polished tech package. But it's a tad too easy to spot less-than-seamless CGI work on the crashing waves and star-filled skies around the lighthouse.

After counseling one son from beyond the grave and rescuing another from a new Ice Age, Dennis Quaid  should have nothing left to prove in the cinematic parenting department. Yet here he is in a remake of Yours, Mine & Ours , in charge of a massive menagerie that's constantly bursting into an orgy of screaming, retching, and oinking (a pig does most of the oinking). Quaid gamely thrusts his face into countless tubs of colorful viscous liquidthank you, co- producers at Nickelodeon Movies !but has little else to do in this shrill family comedy. He plays a Coast Guard  admiral and widower, whose eight kids go a long way toward explaining his wife's mysterious death. Rene Russo  is his forgotten high school sweetheart, an artsy type with 10 brats of her own. They reunite and elope, but their differing opinions about discipline upset the kids, who try to trick the lovebirds into breaking up. To his credit, Quaid looks too smart to be fooled by such blatantly Parent Trap ian machinations, particularly because he's already appeared in the remake of that.
