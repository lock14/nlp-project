Granted, college basketball�s regular season is in full swing now, but Glory Road
 might have been better served by a March release date, when hoops fans are especially hungry for Cinderella stories and Disney-sanitized homilies. Cut from the same cloth as Remember the Titans
 and boasting the same producer (Jerry Bruckheimer), distributor (Touchstone), and a co-writer (Gregory Allen Howard), the frequently rousing Glory Road
 presents a fictionalized account of what many count as the most significant NCAA basketball game ever played, between Don Haskins� underdog Texas Western (now UTEP) and Adolph Rupp�s perennial powerhouse Kentucky in the 1966 championship title game. The significance � beyond being a corker of a game � came down to Haskins� then-revolutionary call to start five black players on the paint.  After a zippy opening montage of historical footage that sets up the racial tensions of the time (and kicks off the film�s terrific, era-specific soundtrack), Glory Road
 hits the road as new coach Haskins (Lucas) scours the country for recruits. White players won�t come to the unranked, cash-poor Texas Western, and so Haskins turns to black players, most of whom are relegated to schoolyard courts or benchwarming in favor of white ballers. Glory Road
 releases the �thumping motivational speech� floodgates early, when Haskins convinces superstar guard Bobby Joe Hill (Luke) to join up, and it�s but the first of many speeches to come. You can�t argue with the message of the movie, but you can take issue with its formulaic approach. The players, portrayed by a host of charismatic, mostly unknown actors, are largely reduced to quirks (the ladies� man, the Black Power guy, etc.); a one-note Lucas, who reportedly gained 35 pounds for the part, stalks through every scene, belly-first and bellowing all the way; and the script hangs on such ready-made metaphors as the newly diagnosed teammate whose heart is literally too large. (Insert Lucas growling, but growling motivationally
: �We�re gonna need you. We�re gonna need your courage.�) And for those of us who thrill every year come March Madness, the Big Dance here will be an awful disappointment: Texas Western�s tournament trajectory is reduced to two games � its nail-biting double overtime against Kansas and the final Kentucky match (in which Texas Western squared off against future NBA coach Pat Riley, among others). Glory Road
 really isn�t a bad show � it�s just an obvious one � and one wishes material of this historical import had received a more refined rendering.


Is it time already for another based-on-a-true-story feel-good Disney sports drama? Didn't that golf movie, ''The Greatest Game Ever Played," just come out?
The studio's inspiration department strikes again with ''Glory Road." The sport is college basketball and the era is the South in the mid-1960s. Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) is a high school girls' coach hired to whip Texas Western University's shabby men's basketball program into shape.
Haskins is given a pittance for recruitment, and the school is barely reputable enough to attract name talent. Desperate and inspired, Haskins fills seven vacancies with black players who weren't college-bound in the first place. Few black men were playing Division 1 ball at the time, so Haskins's move looks bold and progressive. The movie, meanwhile, is such a heat-and-serve operation you could be forgiven for thinking Stouffer's produced it, not Disney.
On their way to a nearly perfect season, the young black men playing for the Texas Western Miners don't mix well with the five white players. The school's administrators pooh-pooh the new recruits. The fans on the road are violent with racism. Somebody on the team has a heart condition. Somebody else is flunking geology. And a heavily made-up Jon Voight arrives at the end, playing coaching legend Adolph Rupp as if he were Ross Perot. But who cares? There's gospel moaning in the musical score and Motown on the soundtrack!
The title road leads to sports history: the first time five African-American starters faced an all-white team in an NCAA championship game. Along the way, the film provides a sobering sense of the adversity that the Miners faced. Yet the era never comes to life the way it should. The visceral authenticity of scenes in which the players face hostility is short-lived, and a generic must-do spirit starts up again.
The movie completely ignores the extent of the personal toll integration must have taken on the white players. Surely they must have discussed amongst themselves the world being forced to change before their eyes. Instead, they're told basically to take one for the team.
All attention to shaded characters and lively dialogue is lavished on the seven black players, who share a complicated, loving dynamic. In El Paso, when they show up at a Mexican nightclub, the film shows us something we rarely see in the movies: a handful of young African-American males looking for fun in the reasonably innocent way the white boys in ''American Graffiti" and ''Diner" did.
Each Miner is played by a charming and compelling actor. Derek Luke is Bobby Joe Hill, the brashest and most charismatic of the group. He played a similar showboat in 2004's far superior Texas football movie ''Friday Night Lights," and he's just as exciting here.
The other young actors are all more rousing than Lucas, whose yelling is one long exclamation point. ''Glory Road" skimps on the husband-and-father stuff, as these movies must, but was Haskins such a cavalier coaching machine at home, too?
''Glory Road" is certainly a tribute to Haskins's audacity and his team's mettle. But it's also a Jerry Bruckheimer production, which is to say the movie isn't built for depth. Director James Gartner follows the Bruckheimer playbook well enough (there's a lot of climactic slow motion) and he keeps ''Glory Road" on message. Bruckheimer also produced 2000's civil rights-era football hit, ''Remember the Titans," and ''Glory Road" dutifully hits most of the same crowd-pleasing notes. But this is a movie you could watch in your sleep.
.

         In 1966, Texas Western, a relatively small college of mining and metallurgy, stormed to the national collegiate men's basketball championship over Adolph Rupp's vaunted University of Kentucky Wildcats. It's a terrific story of a team of Davids with hoop dreams running a gantlet of patrician Goliaths against a backdrop of momentous social change. The Miners, led by Coach Don Haskins, counted an unprecedented seven African Americans in its lineup, including the starting five in the final game, and changed the sociological makeup of the sport, paving the way for the integration of the major southern collegiate sports conferences.
 
  "Glory Road" is a slick, entertaining version of that story, executed with crowd-pleasing efficiency by producer Jerry Bruckheimer, director James Gartner and screenwriters Christopher Cleveland and Bettina Gilois, but not surprisingly lacking in subtlety or complexity. Ripped directly from Disney's playbook of inspirational sports movies, it's devoid of any original elements that might deter it from that successful formula, hewing closer to the sentimental cliches of "Remember the Titans" than the much better "Miracle" or "The Rookie."
 


         






    As Denzel Washington ("Remember the Titans") and Kurt Russell ("Miracle") did before him, Josh Lucas steps into the role of a tough-talking, high-minded coach who teaches his players more than just a game. Haskins arrives at Texas Western (now the University of Texas-El Paso) to inherit a team notably short on talent. The film has Haskins leaping directly from coaching girls high school basketball to leading the Miners to the championship in his first season, though he actually arrived in El Paso in 1961, and minimal integration had already occurred. These changes seem less about heightened drama or economical storytelling than earning easy laughs.
 
  Much of the first part of the movie plays like a culture-clash comedy. Haskins and assistant coach Moe Iba (Evan Jones) recruit from the playgrounds and gyms of the urban north and northeast, gobbling up talent that has been bypassed because of the color of a player's skin. From Detroit, the Bronx, and Gary, Indiana, the black players arrive in West Texas and think they've landed on Mars. As fishes-out-of-water, they must adjust to Haskins' harsh practices and the Tex-Mex culture before venturing into nearby Juarez for some forbidden entertainment.
 
  They reaching a détente with the white players they've largely reduced to supporting roles and the team comes together in its first game when Haskins learns to incorporate the new players' flashy playground game into his defense-first, team-oriented style. Derek Luke stars as the team's best player, Bobby Joe Hill, who Haskins rides to stay as focused on his game as he is on his girlfriend, Tina (Tatyana Ali). The Miners become a juggernaut quickly rising in the national rankings as they move toward the showdown with all-white Kentucky.
 
  The movie works as well as it does on the strength of the performances by Lucas and Luke, and the fact that the players were cast based both on their ability to act as well as play ball. Mehcad Brooks, Alphonso McAuley, Damaine Radcliff, Al Shearer, Sam Jones III and Schin A.S. Kerr do what they can with what are essentially one-dimensional roles, and each has his moment in the spotlight.
 
  Emily Deschanel is largely wasted in the thankless role of Haskins' supportive wife, but Jon Voight brings suitable gravitas in one of his prosthetically-enhanced cameos as the villainous Rupp.
 
  The film takes a more serious tack in dealing with the increasing racism faced by the players as the team gains in prominence, although the filmmakers feel the need to embellish on it. In a story as important and inherently dramatic as this one, it seems unnecessary. While it's a good thing that the film will draw increased attention to them, the team's accomplishments and the subsequent impact are powerful enough to stand on their own.
 
 
'Glory Road'

 
 MPAA rating:
 PG for racial issues, including violence and epithets, and mild language
 
 Times guidelines:
 One savage beating, not especially graphic
 
 A Walt Disney Pictures film, released by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution. Director James Gartner. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer. Executive producers Mike Stenson, Chad Oman, Andy Given.   

When the final buzzer rings in Glory Road , it's not enough that the all-black starting lineup of underdog Texas Western Miners beats the all-white juggernaut University of Kentucky Wildcats to win the 1966 NCAA basketball championship; that story is available in any sports history book. No, when the last swollen chord of hallelujah music fades at the end of this hammily righteous sports-as-life drama, racial equality has slam-dunked a victory over bigotry, nothing less. Integrated teamwork has triumphed over ignorant racism. And we the people of a kinder, gentler, more tolerant 21st-century America are invited to congratulate ourselves on all just getting along with far more sophistication than our forebears in the archaic days of the 1960s. Remember the Titans? Forget about them! Here's a new Jerry Bruckheimer production that places its secular faith in an almighty audience appetite for underdogs, sports, and dramas in which wrongs are righted by good-looking Americans while Mahalia Jackson warbles ''I'm On My Way to Canaan.''
Such is the earnest populist intent and crass fancy-footing of a movie that giddily appropriates ''glory'' in its title  a declaration of magnificence lifted from Edward Zwick's Oscar-winning 1989 historical drama about black soldiers in the Civil War. When coach Don Haskins (Josh Lucas, humbly beefy) moves to underfunded Texas Western University, having previously trained high school girls, his eyes are on the prize of a Division I championship, not civil rights, and he recruits his African-American players for their athletic talent, not out of personal righteousness.
Still, it's only just a jump shot or two before Glory Road  (a feature film debut by commercial director James Gartner) settles into its rudimentary, music-cued rhythms of classroom civics lessons punctuated by on-court action. The exhausting drills and tough love with which Haskins disciplines his crew (the white boys on the team are nice but hopeless squares) echo the techniques of Kurt Russell's Coach Herb Brooks in Miracle , but this time it's not the barbarian Soviets as adversaries; it's a bunch of scowling U. of Kentucky boys, led by arrogant, hatchet-faced coach Adolph Rupp. (Jon Voight plays the old SOB wearing prosthetic ears seemingly modeled on LBJ's famous flappers.)
Aside from star player Bobby Joe Hill (Friday Night Lights ' Derek Luke), who defies training rules to court a sweet gal (Tatyana Ali), the players themselves, both black and white, are an interchangeable bunch: One represents the philosophy of Malcolm X, another that of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a third explains to a honky teammate that ''bad'' means ''good'' in black slang, etc. Indeed, the most memorable characters, for all the wrong reasons, include a caricature of a large, slap-upside-the-head black mama of one athlete who's slacking at his studies and the tearful ''let my boy play'' mother of another with a heart condition.
''Your dignity's inside you!'' Haskins preaches to his boys in the dribbling script by Christopher Cleveland and Bettina Gilois. But in case dignity isn't enough, Glory Road  turns to Martha & the Vandellas singing ''Dancing in the Street'' to score points. Glory Road 's eyes are on the prize of showbiz.

 You could complain that "Glory Road," this season's obligatory inspirational coach-centered sports movie, follows a familiar formula, but that would be like complaining that a basketball is round. The coach, played with requisite intensity by Josh Lucas, harangues his players on the importance of "fundamental, disciplined, defensive basketball." It is easy to imagine that the film's director, James Gartner, heard similar lectures from the producer, Jerry Bruckheimer.  This is not a genre that demands or rewards novelty. The idea is to take a bit of sports history and prune and embellish  it into a three-act screenplay (credited here to Christopher Cleveland and Bettina Gilois) that culminates in the Big Game. Assemble a group of appealing young actors for the team, find a leading man with lungs strong enough to sustain many scenes of barking, bellowing and bloviation, and a pretty, patient actress for the thankless role of coach's wife (Emily Deschanel, in this case), and you're all set. Movies like this are rarely great, but when executed properly, they're rarely bad,  either. "Glory Road" is satisfying less for its virtuosity than for its sincerity, and also because it will acquaint audiences with a remarkable episode that had ramifications far beyond the basketball court.  Like "Remember the Titans," which Mr. Bruckheimer also produced (and which starred Denzel Washington as the coach), "Glory Road" finds its true story at a point where sports history intersects with the struggle for racial equality. The annals of postwar America are full of such moments, but few of them are as astonishing and consequential as the 1966 N.C.A.A. championship game, in which Don Haskins, coach of the Miners of Texas Western  (now known as the University of Texas at El Paso), sent five black players onto the floor against Adolph Rupp's all-white University of Kentucky team.  The film does a good job of showing just how momentous that game was, immersing the audience in a world pervaded by racism, both casual and intense. At the beginning, Haskins  is less a crusader for justice than an ambitious upstart, desperate to turn his backwater program into a contender. The college is a dusty, shabby place where football is the big sport and where the new coach, whose previous job was coaching a girls' high school team in Fort Worth, is forced to live in the men's dormitory with his wife and three young children. None of the top high school prospects - the white ones, anyway - are interested in Texas Western, so Haskins and his colleagues recruit seven talented and unheralded black players from places like the playgrounds of the Bronx and the steel mills of Gary, Ind.  Nearly 20 years after Jackie Robinson broke professional baseball's color line, college basketball was still skittish about accepting black athletes. An unwritten rule invoked in the movie held that a coach could play one black player at home, two on the road and three if his team was losing.  In the film, Haskins's squad is greeted first with skepticism and condescension. Announcers sneer, opponents refuse post-game handshakes, and alumni boosters grumble. As the Miners start winning, hostility grows, and their success opens an ugly seam of ignorance and hatred. Players are booed, cursed at and showered with garbage when they take the court; one  is beaten up in a restaurant men's room; their motel rooms are trashed and sprayed with racist graffiti.  For his part, Haskins receives   hate mail, and is treated by Rupp - a great coach but hardly a progressive on racial matters - with icy disdain. As Rupp, Jon Voight presents the latest in his series of brilliantly idiosyncratic, latex-assisted impersonations of real historical figures. In recent years, he has portrayed Pope John Paul II, Howard Cosell and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. How's that for range?  "Glory Road" does not spend much time developing its characters, but it does tell its story from the team's point of view as well as that of the coach. Derek Luke ("Antwone Fisher") is the proud and charismatic point guard Bobby Joe Hill, and his performance, like his character's approach to basketball, is both stylish and unselfish. Schin A. S. Kerr, as the Miners' fearsome big man, David Lattin, and Al Shearer as his timid roommate and backup, Nevil Shed, have some strong emotional scenes, as does Demaine Radcliffe as Willie Cager, whose heart ailment  limits his playing time. (Mr. Gartner and John Wright, the editor, cut together handily on-court action sequences that make these fine actors look like championship-caliber basketball players).  Nothing the cast does, however, is quite as moving as the appearance during the final credits of some of the real Texas Western players, who reflect, along with Mr. Haskins and Pat Riley, a member of the Kentucky team, on the legacy of their big game. Their faces, aged but hardly elderly, remind us that the events in "Glory Road" did not take place very long ago. That the movie can be uncontroversial and even a little corny may be the clearest indication of how much has changed.  "Glory Road" is rated PG. There is some racist and otherwise profane language, and a few violent scenes.

Disney's profitable roster of uplifting, fact-based sports movies ("Remember the Titans," "Miracle," "The Rookie") has a new hardcourt addition drawn from a terrific story -- the saga of the all-black Texas team whose success spurred the integrating of college basketball throughout the South -- that is, for the most part, deftly executed. Although doubtless destined to evoke comparisons with "Hoosiers" and even TV's "The White Shadow," "Glory Road" is a slick enterprise buoyed by a Motown-flavored '60s soundtrack and an appealing ensemble cast. Box office should be in line with its predecessors and might go higher, provided today's urban teens can accept basketball players wearing short shorts.
For years, Texas Western (now the U. of Texas at El Paso) has been the answer to a college basketball trivia question -- it's the little school that won the national championship in 1966, sandwiched by UCLA's nine titles over a decadelong span beginning in 1964.
Behind that improbable victory was Don Haskins (Josh Lucas), who was given his shot at coaching Division I basketball in football-mad Texas, where part of the job meant living in the dorms with his wife (Emily Deschanel of Fox's "Bones") and three kids while supervising the athletes residing there.
Quickly realizing that he won't be able to compete with traditional college basketball powers for topnotch players, Haskins begins recruiting black players -- who were already playing at other major colleges, but not in the South -- prompting grumbling from his boss and school boosters. "Son, you can't win playin' nigger ball," one tells him.
Undaunted, Haskins presses forward, bringing wide-eyed city kids from New York and others from Indiana to the open spaces of Texas, where they immediately break curfew and team rules with an amusing, sombrero-wearing road trip into Mexico.
Standout guard Bobby Joe Hill (Derek Luke) is among Haskins' biggest challenges, as the coach must try to rein him in to play disciplined ball without muffling his showboating skills. All the players, meanwhile, are subject to indignities on the road, from being pelted with food as they enter arenas to having racial epithets scrawled on their hotel-room walls.
A stunning win streak nevertheless ensues, building toward a championship showdown against Kentucky, whose legendary coach, Adolph Rupp (Jon Voight, borrowing Nicole Kidman's prosthetic nose from "The Hours"), refused to recruit black players at the time.
Meticulously appointed to capture the look and feel of the '60s, pic largely avoids the Tarzan trap of exalting the white coach at the expense of his black players. Moreover, James Gartner -- a commercial director making his feature debut, from a script by husband-and-wife writing team Christopher Cleveland and Bettina Gilois -- elicits nice performances throughout as well as fine little moments, such as a mother imploring Haskins to allow her ailing son to play.
Rebounding from "Stealth," Lucas is perfectly cast as the driven coach, with Luke and Mehcad Brooks ("Desperate Housewives") leading a solid cadre of youthful players who manage to both look convincing on the court and convey the mix of anger and enthusiasm that the youths felt.
The real letdown, alas, comes in the climactic basketball sequence, which adopts an MTV-influenced pace and style that's incongruous with the '60s setting. The producers essentially acknowledge as much -- saying in the press notes that the game action has been enhanced with "dynamic basketball moves that would speak to today's love of slick, fast-paced, tightly competitive action" -- though the final result proves curiously flat and devoid of suspense.
The closing credits help offset that via interviews in which title game participants -- including the real-life Haskins, team members and Miami Heat coach Pat Riley, a then-Kentucky star -- reminisce about the contest. The footage not only lends authenticity to the film but should offer a poignant reminder to younger auds that the overt segregation of a sport now dominated by African-Americans, which feels so distant, really wasn't that long ago.

Sports fans who hate basketball joke that the game would be improved if you gave each team 100 points and two minutes to play instead of 48. The same could be said of the basketball film Glory Road , wherein producer Jerry Bruckheimer  combines the plot from his Remember the Titans where the improbable success of a racially integrated team teaches everyone the meaning of equalitywith the most obvious hoop-film clichés: the long-suffering coach's wife, the slacker who must get his grades up, the moment where the team clicks and they all point and nod at each other in slow motion. In the press notes, Bruckheimer proclaims the story of Coach Don Haskins  (Josh Lucas ) and the 1966 Texas Western Miners who won the NCAA  championship with an allAfrican American starting lineup "one of the great classics of American history." But the team's accomplishments are here diluted into fodder for another of the producer's feel-good man-weepies. As Coach Haskins would have put it, "It's activity without accomplishment."
