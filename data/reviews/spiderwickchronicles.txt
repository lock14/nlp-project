The lasting mystery of "The Spiderwick Chronicles" is why the producers cast actors known for rising to a creative challenge - and then gave them so little to do. Mary-Louise Parker, David Strathairn, Nick Nolte, Dame Joan Plowright - Laurence Olivier's widow, for Pete's sake - all rattle around this noisy action-fantasy contraption looking vaguely stunned. And why shouldn't they? The movie's tweenage target audience has no idea who they are.
Freddie Highmore gets to play twins, though, and that's something. Produced by Nickelodeon and based on a popular book series by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, "Spiderwick" occupies a niche between one of the lower-rent Walden Media young-adult-lit adaptations and "The Chronicles of Narnia" - it's "The Golden Compass" shrunk down to the size of a few cubic acres.
On those acres stands a creepy old house, and into that house move the Graces: newly separated mom (Parker), twins Jared (Highmore) and Simon (Highmore), and teenage daughter Mallory (Sarah Bolger, one of the sisters in "In America"). Jared is bitter - he doesn't know that dad (a briefly glimpsed Andrew McCarthy) is a cheating rat - and he sulks his way into a hidden study where ancestor Arthur Spiderwick (Strathairn) carried out his studies on the faerie realm.
Yes, faeries are real - and brownies and boggarts and sylphs and goblins - and "Spiderwick Chronicles" visualizes them all with duly detailed digitized wonder. Martin Short provides the voice of Thimbletack, a honey-loving house brownie who turns green and bulbous when angered, and there's a piggy hobgoblin who speaks with the frathouse swagger of Seth Rogen.
Great Uncle Arthur wrote a book about the faeries, though, and "Spiderwick" being that sort of movie, it's a book that will Bring About the End of the World if it falls into the hands of Mulgarath, a shapeshifting ogre with the voice and occasionally the makeup-larded face of Nolte. Two-thirds of the film consists of the panicked kids fighting off the bellowing forces of evil just outside the house, trying to hide the apocalypse from mom.
It's a good movie for its type, but it rarely stops to let us marvel at the world it creates. (It's also an assault of noise, action violence, and slimy-creature effects that will delight kids older than eight and terrify their younger siblings - you've been warned.) When the kids visit Uncle Arthur's daughter, the aged Lucinda (Plowright), we do glimpse some remarkable flower-faeries that could have stepped out of "Fantasia" - they're as graceful as the actress herself. More typical are the howling goblins hordes: meticulously rendered hellbeasts that look like Hieronymus Bosch's idea of a Surinam toad.
The most special effect is probably Highmore, who gets to sharpen up his American accent and who makes each twin, bookish Simon and bad-boy Jared, a functioning individual. In its way, "The Spiderwick Chronicles" is a ripsnorting, computerized update of E. Nesbit's old fantasy novels for children, and the way brothers and sister band together to deal with the unknown is reminiscent of Nesbit's far gentler and funnier "Five Children and It." Maybe Nickelodeon should make that one next, and let Highmore play all the roles.


Various winged, fanged, and occasionally shimmering thingies from an unseen world manifest themselves in The Spiderwick Chronicles . There's an ogre, a bunch of goblins, a whole lot of fairies, and a house brownie who turns green when angry. These are the nonhuman denizens of a suitably rambling, isolated storybook house that has passed down the family from Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn) to a soon-to-be-divorced mom (Mary-Louise Parker) with the telegraphic last name of Grace, her teen daughter, Mallory (Sarah Bolger), and younger twins Jared (the angrier, adventurous one) and Simon (the milder, prissier one; both are played by Freddie Highmore).
To be honest, the magical population is kind of dull  average fantasy creatures (some voiced by Martin Short, Seth Rogen, and Nick Nolte), conjured with standard CGI wizardry in a fancy-grade adaptation from popular children's books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black. They're kind of imitative, too  doesn't The Hulk hold the copyright on the green-with-rage issue?
But critters aren't really what the movie is about  otherwise why bring in Mark Waters to direct? After Mean Girls  and Freaky Friday , Waters has become a specialist in lively dramas built on family tensions and kid-on-kid turf tussling. And his production is most alive when it ignores the gremlin contingent and goes for the real horrors, which are: (1) Mom and Dad are getting divorced; and (2) Mom doesn't believe her kids when they tell her of the troubles they've seen. (Parker is a pro at embodying female distractibility.)
Spiderwick  is set in the present, but goes for an overall design look of dainty, cozy, William Morris-y arts-andcraftiness. After Finding Neverland , that tinge of nostalgia has become a Freddie Highmore thespian specialty. Yet the actor, now 16, is never more affecting than when he, as Jared, fumes with contemporary resentment about the gremlins that have split up his parents and forced him beyond the protective boundaries that once encircled his kid-size universe.

 Every devoted reader of children’s literature knows that magic is difficult — for the young wizards who practice it, of course, but even more so for their would-be creators, who must compete in an ever more crowded field. Bookstore shelves are full of spells and sorcery, and so, these days, are multiplexes, as filmmakers take advantage of special-effects technology to bring literary enchantments to life.  “The Spiderwick Chronicles,” adapted from books by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black, represents the latest such effort. Instead of the kind of inspired imaginative synergy that distinguished the “Lord of the Rings” and later “Harry Potter” pictures, this movie, directed by Mark Waters (“Mean Girls”), feels more like a sloppy, secondhand pander. It conjures a world of fanciful creatures —  some benign, others hostile —  and introduces into it a group of squabbling human siblings (played by Sarah Bolger and Freddie Highmore) who have moved into a spooky old house in the middle of nowhere, along with their newly divorced mother, Helen (Mary-Louise Parker).  A previous resident of the house was one Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn), a scholar of the invisible world of sprites and goblins and the author of an encyclopedic reference book on their ways. That book, locked away in a secret room, is coveted by Mulgarath, commander of a bloodthirsty monster crew, who wants to use Spiderwick’s lore to wipe out all the cute little elves and fairies, and the children as well.  Why? Well, just because. Mulgarath takes many different forms, the most frightening of which is surely the person of Nick Nolte. But his malevolence is less scary than routine, as is the anxious twittering of Thimbletack, a honey-eating house spirit (voiced by Martin Short), and the jokey gregariousness of Hogsqueal, a porcine fellow with the voice of a suddenly overexposed Seth Rogen. Joan Plowright also shows up briefly as a wise and witchy old lady who clears up a few mysteries and leaves a few more in her wake.  “The Spiderwick Chronicles” is frantic with incident and hectic with computer-generated effects, including buckets of special Nickelodeon-style slime for the gooey green goblin blood. The human cast works very hard to juggle the expected responses of wonderment, panic and disbelief, and also to work through some domestic issues. Helen’s divorce causes particular tension between her and her son Jared (Mr. Highmore). His twin brother, Simon (also Mr. Highmore), is more conciliatory but also kind of wimpy, and their older sister, Mallory (Ms. Bolger), does a lot of yelling and stamping around before turning her wrath on the goblins.  The actors all struggle  — Mr. Highmore nearly wears himself out trying to accomplish something like what Nicolas Cage did in “Adaptation” —  but to no clear purpose. “The Spiderwick Chronicles” combines a lot of tried and true ingredients on the assumption that it’s following a foolproof recipe. Movie star voices plus family dysfunction plus pixie dust and C.G.I. plus some quirky Anglo-Saxon names should all add up magic. But you can’t just wave a wand and recite an incantation. It’s not as easy as it looks.  “The Spiderwick Chronicles” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some fairly intense scenes of goblin mayhem.

Spinning five short books into one sleek yarn, "The Spiderwick Chronicles" is a brisk, fine-tuned adaptation of Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black's bestselling children's series. Tale of three young siblings -- and the goblins, fairies, griffins and ogres they find lurking in their backyard -- is a work of both modest enchantment and enchanting modesty, grounded in a classically Spielbergian realm where childlike wonderment crosses paths with the tough realities of young adulthood. With careful studio nurturing, this engaging, gratifyingly non-epic adventure should snag midrange B.O. after its Feb. 14 release, benefiting from Imax playdates and lack of family-friendly competition.
The disappointing recent performance of New Line's "The Golden Compass" may have cooled commercial expectations for fantasy blockbusters not 
adapted from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien or C.S. Lewis; like "Compass," Paramount/Nickelodeon's latest effort shows a director previously known for light comedies -- here, Mark Waters ("Just Like Heaven," "Mean Girls," "Freaky Friday") -- taking risks on a broader, more ambitious canvas.
But though it arrives with less fanfare than "Compass" did, "Spiderwick" is a superior movie in almost all respects: less grandiose in scope, but richer in emotion and humor, and boasting visual effects appropriately scaled to the more intimate tenor of the production.
Young Jared (Freddie Highmore) is none too pleased to be leaving New York moving into a rural Victorian manse with his newly divorced mom (Mary-Louise Parker, good), hot-tempered older sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger) and mellower identical twin Simon (also Highmore). Both mischievous and temperamental, Jared is immediately blamed for a series of pranks that turn out to be the handiwork of Thimbletack (voiced by Martin Short), a cute, elf-like brownie who morphs, when provoked, into an angry boggart.
Thimbletack is merely one of the supernatural denizens on the premises, not all of them benign: There are goblins afoot, invisible henchmen of the wicked, shape-shifting Mulgarath (Nick Nolte), who's bent on obtaining a mysterious book left behind by Jared's great-great-uncle, Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn, seen in sepia-toned flashbacks). The tome is a sort of scientific field guide to the various kinds of fairies -- who, along with the entire human race, would be in grave danger if such knowledge were to fall into Mulgarath's possession.
Charged with safeguarding the book at all costs, Jared must plunder its secrets in order to protect them. More pressingly, he must get his siblings and increasingly exasperated mom to believe in the enchanted realm right outside their door -- which, in a sense, is precisely what the filmmakers must accomplish for the audience. They succeed with a sly, offhand approach that never leaves reality entirely behind, allowing the supernatural elements to manifest themselves gradually and imposing limitations on how that manifestation occurs.
Though truncated from the books and festooned with fewer rhymes and riddles, the script (by Karey Kirkpatrick, David Berenbaum and John Sayles) carefully establishes a set of rules governing its magical realm at the outset and adheres to them both scrupulously and cleverly. Plot points such as the kids' inability to see the goblins at first, or the "protective circle" drawn around the house by Spiderwick years ago to keep out evil, work to modulate suspense and emphasize the human characters' vulnerability.
And despite an abundance of comical CG creatures like Thimbletack and the friendly goblin Hogsqueal (voiced by Seth Rogen) -- whom viewers will probably like about as much as they like Dobby the house-elf in the "Harry Potter" pics -- the visual effects have a subtle, rough-hewn quality in keeping with the moody, autumnal reds and browns of Caleb Deschanel's cinematography. Pic builds steadily in visual grandeur, enveloping rather than bombarding the audience; late in the film, the sight of a character engulfed in pixie dust delivers a gorgeous, ethereal frisson.
With dad conspicuously absent, the script inevitably drifts into angry-kid/misunderstood-single-parent territory, which, though well played, feels like a distraction from the material rather than a dramatic extension of it. Pic also at times overdoes the sibling warfare, almost playing up Mallory's disbelief as a way to help auds suspend their own.
But Waters never steers his actors wrong: Highmore ("Finding Neverland," "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory") is winning as ever in a dual role, and Bolger's feisty turn will impress anyone who saw her quietly heartbreaking debut in "In America"; with their fine American accents, the young thesps never once betray that they're from across the Pond. Joan Plowright makes a brief, welcome appearance as an elderly relative who holds secrets concerning the Spiderwick legacy.
Kudos to production designer James Bissell and an army of art directors and set decorators for bringing the cobwebs and crannies of the ramshackle Spiderwick estate vividly to life. Pic was shot in a secluded glade in Montreal, adding to the sense that the story is taking place at the blurred edges of two neighboring worlds; James Horner's score, at times plucking strings to eerie effect, completes the illusion.

Freud lives and prospers in The Spiderwick Chronicles , an exceptionally Oedipal fantasy adventure stuffed with defaulting dads ripe for slaying; a freshly single mom (Mary-Louise Parker ); and one majorly split personality, also known as her twin sons, intelligently played by British child actor Freddie Highmore . Steamed over their family's abrupt moveminus dadto a ramshackle New England  house that once belonged to mom's great-uncle (David Strathairn ), the boys soon find themselves in a fearsomely funny nether world, where they meet a pig-faced hobgoblin voiced by Seth Rogen  and a monster played by Mr. Id himself, Nick Nolte . The movie's richly autumnal look is by swift turns cozily naturalistic and terrifyingly baroque, and director Mark Waters  (Freaky Friday , Mean Girls ) sustains the balance between real and surreal with mischievous brio. But CGI is a seductive mistress, and it's a pity that toward the end, Spiderwick  bogs down in too many effects and too much action, before fizzling into tearful reconciliation on all fronts.
