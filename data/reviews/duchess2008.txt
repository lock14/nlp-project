The Duchess  dramatizes a portion of the true story of a headstrong young aristocrat whose surname is Spencer. The lady, played by Keira Knightley with full awareness of the charms of a demure head tilt, is famous for her glamorous beauty, her influential fashion sense, and her celebrity friends; the gentleman, played by Ralph Fiennes with exquisite nuance in a compassionate depiction of male inexpressiveness, is rich, powerful, and from a renowned British family. The lady is more adored by those around her than by her husband, a socially awkward older man more at ease with pets than with people; the gentleman remains attached, throughout most of the couple's long, incompatible marriage, to another, more worldly woman (Hayley Atwell), ignoring his wife's distress about the ménage.
If the late Princess of Wales, née Diana Spencer, comes to mind, then the makers of this gossipy, dutifully swanky costume biopic can rest easy. They have accomplished their goal of making the unorthodox life of the late-18th-century noblewoman Georgiana Spencer, Duchess of Devonshire, relevant to a 21st- century audience of moviegoers who cheer for romance even while armed with skepticism and copies of People  reminding them how so many "fairy-tale marriages" go bust. (The drama is based on Amanda Foreman's marvelous biography Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire .)
As it happens, Georgiana Spencer  Diana's great-great-great-great-aunt  married William Cavendish, the fifth Duke of Devonshire, in 1774 when she was 17 and he was 26. It was an era of impossibly tall wigs and tight corsets  and the women didn't have it easy either, ba-DUM . But with Knightley in the title role, something interesting happens:  The star's sporty, modern-girl  attitude, her Vogue -worthy eyebrows,  and her athletic build (no matter how impressively those long limbs are encased in complicated gowns of satin and silk) lend an attitude of now-ness to a production that wants to be part historical biopic, part   tabloid-relevant. (Director Saul Dibb has a background in documentaries.)
Knightley, now 23, is not a very deep interpreter of her roles (whether in Atonement  or the Pirates of the   Caribbean  trilogy), nor is she as hip as Kirsten Dunst and the rest of the in crowd who cavorted in Sofia Coppola's  fashion-forward Marie Antoinette  with downtown élan. But that hardly matters in The Duchess . Playing a vivacious colt brokered by her savvy mother (Charlotte Rampling) to a very rich suitor whose chief marital demand is the production of a male heir  not so easy an assignment, as it turns out  Knightley grins or blushes becomingly. She reddens even more erotically when swooning for her own great love, the politician Charles Grey (Mamma Mia! 's Dominic Cooper). And that pink-cheeked simplicity works to the movie's advantage. She's the people's princess.
Anyhow, Georgiana is the least compelling character in this saga  certainly as played out by Knightley against the charisma that Atwell and, especially, Fiennes bring to their roles. Dibb, who shares screenwriter credit with Jeffrey Hatcher and Anders Thomas Jensen, has a nice eye for vignettes that convey the loneliness that can eat the soul, whether at dinner, in bed, or amid sumptuous displays of pomp and circumstance. (This subtext would come across more effectively had the director trusted in the power of silence, and succumbed less to the undistinguished doodles of Rachel Portman's intrusive musical score.) Atwell, who plays Julia in the new Brideshead Revisited , creates an utterly seductive, independent-minded Lady Elizabeth Foster. ''Bess'' was one of English history's most colorful risk-takers, a divorcée who began as Georgiana's great friend, caused that same friend agony when she became the Duke's mistress, and then stuck around the mansion for more than 25 years beloved by them both.
Fiennes, meanwhile, develops a beautiful, wordless vocabulary of hurt, frustration,   sadism, lust, discomfort, arrogance, remorse, and unanalyzed pain for his Duke. He speaks with his body what the script cannot formulate about what it's like to be a man apart.   The actor creates particulars of time, space, class, and personality with one crook of a finger, one twist of a wrist. I call that nobility of craft; he's the actors' prince.
More on The Duchess    Ralph Fiennes on humanizing evil in The Duchess

 No bodices rip in “The Duchess,” an overstuffed, intellectually underbaked portrait of a poor little rich girl, but Ralph Fiennes does take scissors to Keira Knightley’s unmentionables for some shivery snip-snip. Based on a true story, as they say in the movies, the tale traces the cosseted, tightly corseted late-18th-century life of Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire, one of those gilded-cage aristocrats who appear to have been primed, pumped and exclusively prized for the fecundity of their wombs. If the name of another suffering Spencer (guess!) popped into your head, you have made the filmmakers very happy.  Born in 1757, Georgiana went from scampering merrily across the emerald expanse of the family estate under the pitiless gaze of her mother (Charlotte Rampling) to trembling under the unloving touch of the Duke of Devonshire (Mr. Fiennes, very fine). A cold if brilliant catch, the duke took his teenage bride expecting she would instantly bear him a male heir. Fate intervened and the happily ever after never materialized, though the children did pop. She wasn’t scrubbing chamber pots for her keep, but she did have to endure her husband’s dalliances. There were tears and storms, petty and political affairs (along with a little unconvincing Sapphic panting) and, in time, the Amanda Foreman book on which the film is based.  Like most costume dramas of this distaff sort, “The Duchess” wants you to pity Georgiana while also indulging in every luscious detail of her captivity. She may have a pimp for a mother and a bore for a husband, but just look at those verdant landscapes dotted with grazing sheep (no grubbing peasants), the fabulously ornamented gowns, leaning towers of wigs, palatial digs and troops of silent servants. (It’s period-lifestyle pornography.)  Working from the unrevealing screenplay that he wrote with Jeffrey Hatcher and Anders Thomas Jensen, the director Saul Dibb laps it all up and dribbles it back without an ounce of reserve or postempire skepticism, his camera trailing after Georgiana like a dog, a vantage point that badly serves  his inexpert star.  A big-boned beauty who leads with her jaw, Ms. Knightley looks pretty as a Gainsborough picture in and out of her silks and satins, but she’s not a remotely composed one.  Though now 23, she still tends to  throw herself around the room like one of those jangling adolescent girls who, arms and legs pinwheeling, heads bobbing like Halloween apples, have yet to adjust to their newly sprouted bodies. (Modigliani would have loved the willowy bend of her neck if he could have persuaded her to stop fidgeting.) She’s not much of an actress — she pops her eyes instead and thrusts out her chest — but she doesn’t need to be Helen Mirren if she can cultivate a real screen presence. Stillness would become her, as would a good director.  “The Duchess” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). A discreet sexual assault, and the usual aristocratic decadence and vice.

Plumed feathers, powdered wigs and corseted libidos abound in "The Duchess," but for all its luscious period trappings and Keira Knightley's spirited take on the title role, Saul Dibb's handsome biopic reveals little about how Georgiana Spencer Cavendish became one of 18th-century London's most celebrated and influential aristocrats. Reducing a complex portrait to a prototypical tale of passion suppressed by loveless matrimony and the sexist nature of the times, this upscale but undistinguished romantic drama should primarily court femme arthouse auds when it opens Sept. 5 in Blighty. After its Toronto gala, Paramount Vantage unveils the film Sept. 19 Stateside.
Pic's marketing campaign has made much of the fact that its subject was the great-great-great-great-aunt of Diana, Princess of Wales. As painstakingly detailed in "Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire," Amanda Foreman's bestselling biography (adapted here by Jeffrey Hatcher, Anders Thomas Jensen and Dibb), Georgiana was a fashion trendsetter, gossip-column fixture and unhappy wife. And at a time when the American Revolution precipitated radical changes in British society, she was also a prominent player in the conservative, pro-U.S. Whig Party, eclipsing her husband in clout and popularity.
But "The Duchess" sweeps its politics neatly under the rug (a nicely embroidered rug, to be sure), assuming audiences will care more for affairs of the heart than for affairs of state. It's a serviceable picture that offers all the sumptuous visual pleasures of a historical costume drama, yet little in the way of actual history.
It's 1774 when vivacious 16-year-old Georgiana Spencer (Knightley), at the savvy arrangement of her mother (Charlotte Rampling), weds William Cavendish, fifth Duke of Devonshire (Ralph Fiennes, excellent). Installed at his London manse, Georgiana finds the duke a cold, inattentive husband who expects her to overlook his many affairs -- even when the product of one, Charlotte, comes to live with them -- and produce a male heir.
Six years later, Georgiana has borne two daughters (but, as the duke reminds her often, no son) and become the city's reigning socialite, with a severe weakness for drinking and gambling (downplayed in the film). She develops an intimate friendship with Lady Elizabeth "Bess" Foster (Hayley Atwell, her delicate features masking a certain ruthlessness), who has been cast out by her brutish husband. But Georgiana's devotion backfires when Bess becomes the duke's latest conquest and a permanent resident of the household.
In the ensuing battle of wills with her husband, which includes a scene of marital rape, Georgiana turns to her old childhood playmate (and future prime minister), the handsome Lord Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper, "The History Boys"). As their attraction smolders, Charles' youthful ardor clearly preferable to the duke's icy disregard, the story plays out as a drama of true love tragically stifled -- and auds, in turn, may feel the urge to stifle a yawn.
After a series of gritty docs for British TV, Dibb made his bigscreen debut in 2004 with the compelling gangland saga "Bullet Boy." "The Duchess," his first foray into distant history, unfolds with an assured sense of rhythm and visual polish (courtesy of editor Masahiro Hirakubo and d.p. Gyula Pados, respectively). The chambers are exquisitely furnished, the gardens impeccably maintained; Rachel Portman's score piles on yard after tasteful yard of angsty accompaniment.
But in denuding their story of anything that might tax the intellect, Dibb and his co-scribes have stripped away the most compelling reasons to dramatize their heroine's remarkable life. Wigs matter more than Whigs in this picture, which seems more enthralled by the duchess' mile-high coiffure than by her tireless efforts on her party's behalf, missing an opportunity to comment on never-more-relevant issues of feminism, fame and politics.
How Georgiana exploited both her celebrity and her instinctive empathy with commoners to drum up electoral support for her close associate, Lord Charles Fox (an underused Simon McBurney), is dealt with only superficially. Though equally apolitical, Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette" displayed more insight into its subject (an acquaintance of Georgiana's, and arguably the less interesting figure) than "The Duchess" manages with its more straightforward reading of history.
While Knightley ably embodies Georgiana's easy wit, occasional naivete and ahead-of-her-time common sense, her performance is somewhat diminished by its familiarity and the film's reductive view of its protag. And as lovely as the actress is, all that finery can have a smothering effect; she looked more radiant amid the sweat and squalor of Joe Wright's "Pride & Prejudice."
Fiennes (23 years Knightley's senior, despite their characters' eight-year age gap) admirably renders the duke less a villain than a weary pragmatist, capable of cruelty but also odd flashes of compassion. Rampling projects warm steel as Georgiana's mother and closest confidante, while Atwell ("Brideshead Revisited") subtly suggests Bess' capacities for both loyalty and treachery.


Based on Amanda Foreman 's biography of Georgiana Spencer , the Duchess of Devonshire, Saul Dibb 's costume drama tells how Princess Diana 's 18th-century ancestor (played here by Keira Knightley )—a naive ingénue married off in her teens to a fornicating icy stiff (get the parallel?)—grew into a politically sophisticated woman. Cruising lightly over Georgiana's activism, Dibb firmly turns the spotlight on her love life, in which she must come to terms with a ménage à trois at home and a passionate love affair with Charles, Earl of Grey (an incongruously laddish Dominic Cooper ), a future prime minister and namesake of the posh tea. But for all its frisky high jinks, brocaded homes, and creamy bosoms, The Duchess is a tragedy about the terrifying vulnerability of even the richest women in a society that deprives them of property rights. As a tale of mature self-sacrifice, the movie would be almost unbearably moving were it not for Knightley's insubstantial performance, which allows her to be fatally upstaged by Ralph Fiennes —who, despite having played many a stiff quite stiffly, has bags of fun here playing Georgiana's husband: a jerk, but also a man of his time who's not oblivious to the happiness of the women in his life.
