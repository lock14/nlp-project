         "Shopgirl" is like "Pygmalion" for the upper-middle-brow business class flier. Which isn't to say it's bad. On the contrary, it's smart, spare, elegant and understated. Especially the sex scenes, in which Claire Danes poses like an Ingres Odalisque in an extra languid mood. The movie positively blushes with class, taste and high-mindedness, and anyone thinking of seeing it just for the chance to see Danes naked will be sorely disappointed. She appears strictly in the nude
.
 
  Directed by Anand Tucker ("Hilary and Jackie") from a screenplay adapted by Steve Martin from his novella (he also produced), "Shopgirl" is a wistful account of the yearlong love affair between a 50-year-old millionaire and a lonely, debt-saddled service sector serf in her 20s. It stars Danes, Martin and Jason Schwartzman, respectively, as the girl in the window, her benefactor-with-benefits and a grotty fellow waif whom success, improved grooming and prolonged exposure to self-help literature eventually transform into a suitor the millionaire-narrator can feel good about handing her off to.
 


         






    Mirabelle Buttersfield (Danes) is stranded at Saks Fifth Avenue, selling evening gloves nobody wants from a remote counter off the coast of the couture department, when a browsing computer tycoon sees something he likes. Ray Porter (Martin) buys a pair of gloves, finagles Mirabelle's name from management and has the accessories delivered to her shabby Silver Lake apartment, along with a note inviting her to dinner.
 
  Having endured a few dates with a socially inept amp salesman and font designer named Jeremy (Schwartzman), whose idea of a date consists of taking her to Universal CityWalk and borrowing money, Mirabelle agrees to go out with Ray — but not before Martin has assured us in voice-over that what this girl needs is "an omniscient voice to illuminate her, to tell the world this 
one has value."
 
  This one, that is, as opposed to that one — as in Mirabelle's gold-digging co-worker, Lisa (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras), whose fanged bimbonics further secure Mirabelle's place among the ranks of the cute, deserving poor. Lisa serves another important function: She makes Ray's interest in Mirabelle look more curatorial than acquisitive. His taste in girls (like his taste in clothes, art, cars, food, wine, etc.) is exquisite. He's no rank consumer. He's a connoisseur.
 
  Okey-dokey. But then who, exactly, is calling her a "shopgirl"? (Certainly not Saks; they understand the magical morale-boosting properties of "sales associate.") Well, that would be her omniscient lover. From the get-go, Ray and Mirabelle's relationship is based on a power dynamic roughly analogous to the one in "Bambi Meets Godzilla," the Merchant-Ivory version. A self-described "terrible judge of character," Mirabelle concludes on their first date that Ray is not dangerous, and from that point forward nothing he does can change her mind — not even the rehearsed morning-after speech he delivers announcing that he would like to keep seeing her, but — everybody now — he's not looking for a relationship at the moment.
 
  As Mirabelle falls in love, Ray falls into a creepy in loco 
parentis 
role, spoiling her with little luxuries that far exceed her means (like new dresses), and quickly moving on to grand gestures of life-changing largesse. Ray's beneficence, combined with an oddly fusty Victorian tone imported from the book, give "Shopgirl" an almost Dickensian feel — like "Oliver Twist" for dirty old men. For a movie predicated on themes of power and exploitation, in other words, it does a pretty nimble dance around the elephant in the room — even as the elephant slowly lowers its haunches, threatening to pulverize every carefully constructed rationalization and sophisticated attitude in sight.
 
  This, naturally, is the most interesting thing about the movie, and really a very good reason to see it. It's hard to think of another film this year as likely to inspire debate, or even smashed crockery. It's not that the movie is blind to its characters' faults — it's not. It's just honest up to a point. Mirabelle awkwardly calls Ray "mister," like a kid in a joke about a stranger with candy, but never dares call him "sweetheart." And Ray's inability to love Mirabelle is copped to early and often. But "Shopgirl" never removes its gloves.
 
  For an artist (she draws), Mirabelle is strangely lacking in insight. Never once does she rebel against Ray's remove, never once does she even wonder whether their relationship is purely transactional. She only submits — and so graciously. She's not dumb, though. And there are hints that the relationship is taking its toll. But the depression that knocks her off her feet in the middle of the movie (she stops taking her medication because she's happy) is treated like a purely chemical pathology. Ray has a shrink to talk to; when Mirabelle crashes he takes her to the doctor and gets her back on her meds.
 
  And it's not just Mirabelle who doesn't get a turn illuminating Ray. Nobody else — not his awful, viperish ex (Rebecca Pidgeon), not his shrink, not even Jeremy — get a single word in on the subject. There's just that omniscient voice admitting that the relationship was, er, fundamentally problematic and, um, ultimately bittersweet, but, as Ray concludes in parting thoughts, "that's life."
 
  That's life? That's it? OK, it stands to reason that director Tucker didn't push things further. Actually, considering the circumstances, Tucker does exceedingly well. Shifting the movie's point of view to Danes helps quite a bit. Danes can fill a scene with one wounded glance, and her body language alone conveys a richness of character that makes an otherwise not very expressive character mesmerizing. She also does something interesting with Mirabelle's passivity— she plays it as quasi-mute, awestruck intimidation that speaks volumes.
 
  For some reason, it made me recall Hans Weingartner's recent, excellent "The Edukators," in which a waitress roughly Mirabelle's age becomes indentured to a man roughly Ray's age after she crashes her uninsured Volkswagen into his Mercedes (of which he, like Ray, has several), and he makes her buy him a new one. When the waitress sees just how huge the discrepancy between his effect on her life and her effect on his, she trashes his house. In "Shopgirl," she leaves without a fuss.
 
  For all of its sensitivity and intelligence, and its finely observed details ("Shopgirl" is nothing if not hawk-eyed about the accouterments of social rank), the movie is oblivious to the pleasures of life off the status grid. Rather than let the warm, eccentric, goofy Jeremy just wise up to Mirabelle's demure charms, it nudges him subtly into Ray's camp. It's one thing when Jeremy sends Mirabelle a rose, another when he shows up in a shining new Toyota and tells her he'll protect her. She's been protected enough.

 Touchstone Pictures and Hyde Park Entertainment present an Ashok Amritaj production. Directed by Anand Tucker. Screenplay by Steve Martin. Based on his novella.   

Mirabelle (Claire Danes), the drooping long-stemmed rose who sells fancy gloves in the depressive and self-regarding not-quite-love story Shopgirl , is passive in most things. Attracting the romantic attention of both Jason Schwartzman as Jeremy, an uncouth, insolvent young guy, and Steve Martin as Ray, a financially generous but emotionally stoppered older man, she accepts no responsibility for her own fate. Only in her wardrobe, apparently, does she  or the costume designer of this pinched New Yorker short story of a project  get to express a muted, refined sense of herself as the kind of young woman who deserves better things, finer things, things that could only be provided by Steve Martin's kind of older man.
Martin, after all, wrote the screenplay, based on his precisely carved novella of the same name. He produced. He certainly stars. And although Hilary and Jackie's Anand Tucker directed, mixing in the visual flourishes of an old-time glamorous Hollywood romance (and loading on the aural gold leaf with Barrington Pheloung's intrusive score), it is Martin's romantic melancholy we surely see, refracted through the prism of Ray's cultured taste in sushi, art, and girls as poetically chic as Claire Danes. (She gives off a lunar glow  part moonlit, part living-dead.)
In their way, Mirabelle and Ray are the deracinated West Coast equivalents of a Woody Allen couple  she a lovely, somber thing who can't resist his erudition, he a proud snob who only thinks he's confessing his flaws with admirable honesty. In fact, Ray  and Shopgirl   appear all too wistfully satisfied with not giving enough.

 Every year, Hollywood cuts yards of so-called romantic comedy from bolts of synthetic cloth. The elegant and exquisitely tailored "Shopgirl,"  written by Steve Martin,  based on his slender novel of the same name, and directed by Anand Tucker ("Hilary and Jackie"), puts most of them to shame. As it relates the delicate, almost anecdotal story of a young woman looking for love in modern Los Angeles, the movie reveals what is missing from most others of its kind: the fact of sex  and the possibility of heartbreak, which is to say the very conditions of romance itself.  American commercial cinema is happy to crack dirty jokes and sing maudlin hymns to matrimony, but "Shopgirl," which is both funny and sweetly sad, aims for something other than salaciousness or sentimentality. It is partly about how the specter of love can give ordinary life a feeling of risk and enchantment, a process that Mr. Tucker discreetly recapitulates on screen. The crisp and lovely images (shot by Peter J. Suschitzky), though never self-consciously pretty, turn drab daily reality into a satisfying aesthetic experience. And the movie's jewel-like moments of humor and disappointment are tastefully laid out on the velvet cushion of Barrington Pheloung's luxurious orchestral score.  All that string-heavy music makes "Shopgirl" feel a bit like an older movie - a 1950's Technicolor romance or a 40's weepie, perhaps - but the setting and characters are thoroughly contemporary. Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes), as charming as her name, with just the right hint of oddness, commutes every day from her modest apartment in Silver Lake to her job selling gloves at Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills. Not the practical, hand-warming kind (this is Los Angeles, after all), but the long, thin-fingered accessories that once were a requirement of feminine glamour and have been demoted to the status of indulgent caprice. Mostly, she stands behind a counter, removed from the main retail action, as the camera admires her from a discreet distance.  Ms. Danes, whose performance is flawless, is certainly lovely enough to invite such admiration, but she does not go out of her way to solicit it. The movie's conceit depends upon our ability to believe that Mirabelle, who moved to California from Vermont, is lonely and overlooked - not quite an ugly duckling, but someone whose diffident, melancholy temperament might render her invisible in a world more interested in flashy display. (Such display is embodied by one of Mirabelle's co-workers, a gold-digging blonde played with marvelous verve by Bridgette Wilson-Sampras.) With her student loans, her futon furniture, her poky pickup truck and the antidepressants in her medicine cabinet, Mirabelle could be one of countless recent college graduates fumbling through early adulthood in the drifting, wanting state that sociologists used to call anomie. (This condition, as it afflicts the young, was uncompromisingly captured in Andrew Bujalski's decidedly unromantic "Funny Ha Ha.")  What Mirabelle needs, Mr. Martin's introductory voiceover tells us, is someone to recognize and appreciate her, to pluck her out from the crowd and confer a sense of specialness on her. The movie itself does this, of course, and so do the other two main characters, who become unwitting rivals for Mirabelle's affection.  The first suitor is Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman), who chats her up one night in a Laundromat. (To judge from his overall personal hygiene, it's probably a rare visit.) Jeremy, who works for a manufacturer of amplifiers ("I'm involved in stenciling"  is how he puts it), represents the incisive caricature of a familiar generational type - the emo-slacker-hipster-doofus. Whether he is oblivious to his own immaturity or proud of it is hard to say. But his childishness is not without a certain appeal, and in any case he is available, so Mirabelle, panicked by her own need and isolation, goes on a less-than-thrilling date, and later - even less thrillingly - to bed with him.  And then along comes Ray Porter, a well-dressed older man with impeccable taste and unlimited resources, who is also recognizable to anyone not actually in "Shopgirl" as its screenwriter and narrator. Mr. Martin, with his silvery suavity and mutedly sardonic voice, has long since proven himself a mild and sensible guy, as well as an acute comic miniaturist. Ray's relationship with Mirabelle at first resembles the thwarted romance between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in "Lost in Translation" (whose writer and director, Sofia Coppola, happens to be Mr. Schwartzman's first cousin). But Ray turns out to have more in common with Don Johnston, the middle-aged bachelor Mr. Murray plays in Jim Jarmusch's "Broken Flowers." Both Ray and Don are solitary, soft-spoken seducers, who have made their money in unspecified computer-related enterprises and who lead lives of serene and solitary good taste.  There is something attractively wistful about Ray, and also something calculating. In the course of his affair with Mirabelle, which occupies the long middle section of "Shopgirl," you can feel a chilly whiff of cynicism troubling the warm, romantic air. The literature of an earlier age would have used words like mistress or kept woman to describe Mirabelle, who happily accepts Ray's impressive generosity. The idea of buying and selling is right there in the film's title. But in a milieu as defined by consumerism as this one - the opening shot lingers over all the good stuff for sale at Saks - it may be difficult to conceive of a love that is not to some degree also a transaction.  Which is not to say that this is "Pretty Woman" all over again. Quite the contrary. That movie simplified and falsified a complicated (and objectively ugly) connection between its main characters, whereas this one finds complexity in a relationship that appears to be perfectly simple. Ray, who delights in giving Mirabelle nice presents, is a bit stingier with his emotions, and tries, after their first night together, to establish parameters and time limits. Mirabelle, swept up in his gallantry, is at a disadvantage. She has only herself to give.  Mr. Martin and Mr. Tucker neither minimize nor overstate the inherent cruelty of this scenario; nor do they deny its potential for tenderness and intimacy. The most complimentary and the most damning thing to be said about Ray is that he is a gentleman; he lives by a code that may ultimately be self-serving but that nonetheless obligates him to do his best to behave decently. Jeremy, on the other hand, seems altogether feral, if not infantile, driven by his immediate needs and impulses and oblivious to the rules and expectations that make society work.  And, it should be added, that make love possible. The thinnest, funniest strand in the  braided narrative of "Shopgirl" involves Jeremy's eccentric journey in the direction of maturity, a trip aided by self-help tapes and a wise rock musician. But Jeremy's growth is, in a way, the key to the movie, which depends on the recognition that people change, and indeed change one another. This process is both farcical and painful, a doubleness Mr. Tucker manages to acknowledge without sliding into coarseness or melodrama.  "Shopgirl" is a resolutely small movie, finely made and perhaps a bit fragile. Under the pressure of too much thought, it might buckle and splinter; the characters might look flimsy, their comings and goings too neatly engineered, their lovability assumed rather than proven. And it's true that none of them are perfect. From where I sit, though, the film they inhabit comes pretty close.  "Shopgirl" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Without being too graphic or crude, it's about how adults talk and behave.

Steve Martin the author is well served by Martin the multihyphenate in "Shopgirl," a smartly reconstituted yet largely faithful adaptation of his precisely crafted novella about the mixed signals, misinterpretations and melancholy life lessons that define bittersweet romance. Mainstream auds expecting a Martin laff riot may be surprised -- and disappointed -- by the paucity of guffaws, which could translate into downbeat word of mouth. With careful marketing and critical support, however, the pic could reach enough simpatico ticket-buyers to post respectable numbers, improving in homevid.
Collaborating with helmer Anand Tucker ("Hilary and Jackie"), Martin does triple duty as scripter, star and co-producer. But except for a snippet of scene-setting narration, he doesn't enter until 20 minutes into the pic.
Opening scenes deftly establish the loneliness and wistful yearning of aspiring artist Mirabelle Buttersfield (Claire Danes), a twentysomething transplanted Vermonter whose sense of isolation is enhanced by her job as sales clerk at the seldom-frequented glove counter in a fashionable Los Angeles department store.
Mirabelle is so hungry for human connection she accepts a date with scruffy motormouth Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman) and eventually has comically unsatisfying sex in a scene typical of sporadic episodes--most involving Jeremy -- that deliberately disrupt pic's overall contemplative tone.
Although Jeremy becomes instantly smitten, Mirabelle attaches little importance to their relationship, making it easier for her to shift her focus when Ray Porter (Martin) appears at her glove counter.
A smoothly self-possessed dot-com millionaire with a private jet and lavish L.A. and Seattle homes, the fiftysomething Ray woos Mirabelle with equal measures of courtly attentiveness and methodical determination.
After they make love for the first time, however, he politely but firmly tells her they should keep their options open and see other people.
Later, in a clever split-screen sequence that recalls a similar moment in "Annie Hall," Ray tells an acquaintance that he and Mirabelle agree theirs is a no-strings-attached relationship. On the other side of the screen, Mirabelle indicates to friends that she senses a deepening commitment.
Ray's wealth allows him to buy expensive clothes and pay off a huge student loan for the lovely young woman. And he's reflexively courteous and compassionate in times of emergency.
But despite these gestures, eventually even the lovestruck Mirabelle has to acknowledge the unbridgeable distance between them.
Martin hits all the right notes while subtly conveying both the appealing sophistication and the purposeful reserve of Ray. But he cannot entirely avoid being overshadowed by Dane's endearingly vulnerable, emotionally multifaceted and fearlessly open performance. (In a few scenes, she appears so achingly luminescent it's almost heartbreaking to watch her.) The two stars bring out the very best in each other, particularly in a poignant final scene.
Martin and Tucker are surprisingly successful at capturing the distinctive tone and delicate nuances of a novella that often reads like the work of a contemporary Henry James. (There's a provocative hint of "The Beast in the Jungle" to both the novella and this adaptation.)
Some readers may complain Martin has upset the balance of his original storyline by drastically expanding the character of Jeremy. But though the alteration creates a more conventional romantic triangle, it also allows Schwartzman to provide welcome comic relief. He's especially funny during a mistaken-identity encounter with Bridgette Wilson-Sampras as Mirabelle's gold-digging co-worker.
Judging from the virtually wordless cameos by familiar supporting players -- including Frances Conroy as Mirabelle's mom and Clyde Kusatsu as her boss -- other significant changes were effected in the editing room during an unusually long post-production period.
Much like Martin's scripts for "L.A. Story" and "Bowfinger," "Shopgirl" -- both book and film -- places characters in a vividly detailed, semi-affectionately satirized L.A. landscape. Pic has fleeting fun with the city's more amusing eccentricities. (A visit to Universal CityWalk is both funny and character-defining.)
But the most deeply affecting moments in "Shopgirl" spring from a sense of the city as a place where disconnectedness is the norm, and isolation breeds neediness in those who are emotionally vulnerable.
Tucker underscores these elements with astute framing, graceful camera movements and shrewd pacing. He gets invaluable assistance from lenser Peter Suschitzky, costumer Nancy Steiner and production designer William Arnold.
Composer Barrington Pheloung occasionally errs on the side of overstatement, but pic's recurring main theme is aptly evocative.

The movie version of Steve Martin 's slim first fiction is an uneasy marriage of form and contenta wan, world-weary representation of anomie, loneliness, and low expectations, dressed up in the ill-fitting designer duds of the studio rom-com. Pensive, pretty Vermont  transplant Mirabelle (Claire Danes ) works at, or just leans on, the rarely frequented glove counter at Saks  in L.A. The struggling artist lives alone with her cat and seems to have little in the way of a support network, which may explain why she allows grubby Jeremy (Jason Schwartzman ), a broke font-designer who's a late bloomer in the superego department, anywhere near her. Bachelor number two, smoothly tailored Ray (orange-hued Martin), is a diffident middle-ager with intimacy issues, but he's rich and generous and easy to be around (though Martin's generally recessive performance is especially pained and sheepish during the initial courtship).
Martin's screenplay, helmed by Hilary and Jackie  director Anand Tucker , unfolds as a series of slightly disjointed vignettes, padded with redundant voiceover and an oppressively histrionic score. Mirabelle's difficult withdrawal from antidepressants, for instance, comes out of nowhere, though it does provide brief occasion for a peek past Shopgir l 's reflective surfacesand thanks to Danes, who's bundled and skimmed in a series of flower prints, the script's every slightest hint at the contents of Mirabelle's inner life opens like a bud. Danes's performance is as bright and tender as a new bruise, and thus Shopgirl  is a strangely hybrid creature: a hollow store mannequin with a broken, beating heart.
