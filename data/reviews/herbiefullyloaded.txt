Disney has gone back to the cedar closet again and come out with "Herbie: Fully Loaded," a remake of the studio's goofy polyester-era series about a Volkswagen bug with a mischievous soul. Fully loaded with what? you may ask. Product placement, as far as I can tell. Like the recent "Freaky Friday" redo, the movie stars Lindsay Lohan, but unlike "Friday," there's no Jamie Lee Curtis to provide any real zip. Instead, we're given Michael Keaton in a mopey-widower role that negates his gift for comedy, Matt Dillon squandering his talent as a fatuous bad guy, and a car with an attitude problem. Where's Dean Jones when you really need him?
Let it go on the record that the critic's wife and daughters and daughters' friends and daughters' friends' parents were each of the opinion that the new "Herbie" was "better than I expected," perhaps because recent tabloid reports had led them to expect Lohan to stagger in front of the camera blind drunk, shriek obscenities, and collapse from anorectic heart failure. She doesn't; in fact, she's as gruffly engaging as ever -- Hilary Duff with a spine.
As for the critic, who tries to avoid gossip and focus on the movie at hand (discount those Internet rumors that Lohan had her bust digitally reduced in the editing room!), he found "Herbie: Fully Loaded" exactly as blandly noisy and inoffensively average as he thought it might be. So there's something to be said for lowering your expectations.
Lohan is cast as Maggie Peyton, just-graduated daughter of Ray Peyton Sr. (Keaton), a former stock-car racer who has pinned his hopes on hapless Ray Jr. (Breckin Meyer). Maggie loves to race, but dad won't let her since his wife's death. (Yes, another Disney movie with a dead mom -- has the entire story department considered therapy?) She comes across Herbie in a scrapyard and saves the aging Beetle from being junked; soon he's showing her his need for speed.
"Fully Loaded" is lucky enough to be about a woman racer at the exact moment the topic is in the news with Danica Patrick's fourth-place showing at the Indianapolis 500, and the script gets in some pro forma equal-opportunity plugs. There's also a sweet young mechanic (Justin Long, from TV's "Ed") who gets under the hood (Herbie's, not Maggie's), the heroine's obnoxious Val-gal best friend (Jill Ritchie), and a preening race champion named Trip Murphy (Dillon) who gets smoked by Herbie in a street race and spends the rest of the movie plotting revenge.
It's all cute enough, and the bits where Herbie squirts oil on people or rolls his headlights in disgust make the kids laugh. A demolition derby sequence in which the bug is almost crushed by a snorting monster truck is fairly nightmarish, though, and good luck explaining why Herbie's antenna goes sproing
 when he sees a shapely yellow new-model Volkswagen.
"Fully Loaded" is only interesting on a grown-up level because it isn't just a remake of a Disney movie from the past -- it is
 a Disney movie from the past. The songs studding the soundtrack are classic-radio fist-pumpers -- "More Than a Feeling," "Magic," "Working for the Weekend" -- and the photography has the grainy, washed-out West Coast sunlight of vintage '75 Roger Corman. The projection behind Lohan in the driving scenes reaches back even further: It would do Tippi Hedren in "The Birds" proud.
The only thing that marks "Fully Loaded" as part of the here and now is its worship for all things NASCAR. The film was shot at the California Speedway, and a bevy of real-life racers turns up in cameos: Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, and others whose names will mean nothing or everything to you. Where the races in the old "Herbie" movies were slapstick affairs, the climax here is reverential, with cars hitting the track in slow-motion, to trumpet fanfares. "Fully Loaded" becomes more about the race than about Herbie, and that can't be right.
But you can see why Disney -- and Hollywood in general -- would be drawn to NASCAR racing, since the sport takes the possibilities for product placement to unheard-of heights. Because cars and racers are plastered with the names of their sponsors, every shot becomes an ad. Dillon's Trip Murphy shills for Cheetos simply by walking into frame; a lineup of cars at the starting gate is a paean to Home Depot and UPS. The very name of the race -- the Nextel Cup -- has been sold.
Maybe this is pointless carping to racing fans, but for a parent whose children have advertising stuffed down their throats from the moment they wake up until the moment they go to sleep, it's a distress signal. At least Herbie retains his innocence in this and other matters -- but the way he's looking at the yellow Beetle has me worried.

         The concept behind "Herbie: Fully Loaded" is so venerable it's not only older than its intended audience, it may even be older than some of their parents.
 
  The Volkswagen Beetle with a mind of its own and a weakness for speed debuted in 1969's "The Love Bug" and proved popular enough to dragoon the widest possible range of actors — from Don Knotts to Helen Hayes — into a series of theatrical and TV sequels.
 


         






    Now the only car that ever needed an exorcist is back in business with its rambunctious spirit remarkably intact. "Herbie: Fully Loaded" is that modern rarity, a genial, sweet-natured family film, G-rated and proud of it, an old-fashioned Disney movie to the core.
 
  How rare it is to see a film, even one intended for kids, without scatological references. A film where only a single chaste romantic kiss is allowed, and that at the close. A film where everyone, even the dastardly villain, studiously ignores how alluring star Lindsay Lohan looks in a series of snug T-shirts and short skirts.
 
  Directed by Angela Robinson, who debuted with "D.E.B.S.," and written by the inevitable posse of comedy scribes (four did the screenplay, three get story credit, all based on characters created by someone else), "Herbie" is made by people who understand playful. It may be by-the-numbers, but it knows that under the right circumstances those numbers can lead to a fair amount of fun.
 
  The amusement starts during the credits, when a series of newspaper clips displays a version of the life Herbie's been leading — running with the bulls at Pamplona, starring in something called "Beach Bugs," hanging out with the talking car from TV's "Knight Rider" — since last our path crossed his.
 
  Now Herbie finds himself in a junkyard, Crazy Dave's Scrap and Salvage to be specific, where the motto is "We put the cash into crash." Who knows what horrors would have awaited him if newly minted college graduate Maggie Peyton (Lohan) hadn't stopped by to purchase a used car.
 
  Maggie is the most skilled member of the legendary Peyton racing clan, but her father Ray Sr. (an underutilized Michael Keaton) prefers that her brother (Breckin Meyer) do the competitive driving even though the team is losing sponsors faster than Ray Sr. is losing hair.
 
  One thing definitely leads to another once the headstrong Herbie ("I'm being carjacked by my own car," Maggie complains) takes charge.
 
  Soon Maggie has reacquainted herself with handsome young mechanic Kevin (Justin Long), and she's locking horns — and wheels — with the Mephistophelean NASCAR champion Trip Murphy, nicely played by Matt Dillon, who manages to bring real verve to lines like "I'm gonna exterminate that bug."
 
  In addition to being well cast (by Rick Montgomery) with comic professionals who know their business, "Herbie" gets its money's worth out of the 36 different vintage bugs used in filming.
 
  While some racing situations are too obviously computer generated, these cars, the press notes tell us, have been effectively "refashioned to operate as giant robotic puppets" as they convincingly deliver Herbie's emotional reaction to a variety of situations.
 
  Even with all of this, "Herbie: Fully Loaded" wouldn't function well without Lohan's presence. The part doesn't require great acting, but absent its star's easy and appealing manner (reminiscent of her fine work in 1998's "The Parent Trap") the rest wouldn't be as effective as it is. True, there are moments when Lohan looks surprisingly weary on screen for an 18-year-old, bringing her much-publicized troubles with overzealous paparazzi to mind, but when you've got Herbie in your corner nothing else, finally, matters. At least for now.

 "You can take the car out of the junkyard, but you can't take the junkyard out of the car," growls Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon), an arrogant stock-car racing champion whose supremacy has been seriously challenged by a souped-up 1963 Volkswagen Beetle and its plucky driver, Maggie Peyton (Lindsay Lohan). Trip, the designated villain in "Herbie: Fully Loaded," eventually comes to believe that the upstart Beetle is demonically possessed. "It's alive!" he screams as men in white coats drag him into the back of an ambulance. But Trip isn't crazy.  "Herbie: Fully Loaded," which opens nationwide today, is a perfectly silly movie for a silly season that in recent years has forgotten how to be this silly. Directed by Angela Robinson, this latest installment in the movie-television franchise about a tiny car named Herbie with a will of its own and the temperament of a rambunctious 7-year-old knows exactly what it is and what it isn't.  What it is is "The Love Bug" for the Nascar generation, with a charismatic teenage star at the wheel. This G-rated movie comfortably blends the cutesy mannerisms and well-scrubbed wholesomeness of that late-60's Disney hit with the vroom of today. Never for a moment, even during the racing sequences, does it pretend to be real.  What "Herbie: Fully Loaded" isn't is a movie to be taken seriously, unless you consider Ms. Lohan's Maggie, who defies her father, Ray Sr. (Michael Keaton), to race Herbie, a feminist role model for tweener girls. In the original "Love Bug," Herbie salvaged the career of a fading race-car driver, played by Dean Jones, by driving him to victory. In "Fully Loaded," Maggie salvages Herbie from a junkyard with $75 given to her as a college graduation present. Later, she saves him from destruction at a demolition derby, just as the battered little bug is about to be chewed up by a gargantuan truck with metal teeth.  As in so many Disney films, the signals are shrewdly mixed. Though Maggie triumphs in the ultramacho world of Nascar, her victory comes at a price. As the story begins, she arrives at her college graduation by skateboard at the last minute. The first person in a family of stock car racers to finish college, she is looking forward to moving to New York to work as an assistant at ESPN.  As in another Disney film released this year, "Ice Princess," the heroine is forced to choose between short-term sports stardom and a long-term career investment that makes use of her education. (In "Ice Princess" the choice is between the rink and college.) It's not much of surprise that in an era in which everyone is supposedly entitled to his or her 15 minutes of fame, stardom wins.  It helps that Ms. Lohan, unlike the pallid Michelle Trachtenberg in "Ice Princess," is a genuine star who combines a tomboyish spunk with a sexy, head-turning strut, executed with minimal self-consciousness. Likable but never saccharine, confident but not snooty, and endowed with the natural freckled-faced beauty of an 18-year-old Everywoman, Ms. Lohan seems completely at home on the screen.  If she were not its star, "Herbie: Fully Loaded" would have to rely on stock mechanical gimmickry for its appeal and on the reassuring but recycled image of a little car that can outrun the big guys. Herbie spits oil into the faces of his detractors and bops them with doors that suddenly swing open with alarming force. He bleats his horn in furious protest, flirts with his headlights and, to the sounds of Lionel Richie's "Hello," nuzzles up to a sleek yellow sports car, bumper to bumper.  In one contest, he streaks to victory on a guardrail. In another, he makes a sudden leap to the sounds of Van Halen's "Jump." If the movie is a big hit, it could signal the waning of the sport utility vehicle era; or not.  After some tension and misunderstanding, Ms. Lohan and Herbie eventually form a bond of trust. Once upon a time, it used to be a girl and her horse. Now it's a girl and the car that drives her.

Lindsay Lohan continues her reign as queen of Disney remakes with "Herbie: Fully Loaded," a pleasingly retro recycling of "The Love Bug" (1969's highest-grossing pic) and its various feature and tube sequels. Though aimed primarily at a demographic much younger (and less aggressively hip) than the crowd that flocked to see Lohan's somewhat saucier turn in last year's "Mean Girls," family-friendly comedy about an amazingly anthropomorphic '63 VW Beetle likely will further enhance actress's marquee value. More important, pic should prove a potent B.O. performer as G-rated alternative to darker and/or edgier summer fare. 
Working from script credited to small platoon of scribes (and based on characters created by Gordon Buford), helmer Angela Robinson smoothly shifts gears from her coming-out comedy "D.E.B.S." for a different take on girl power.
Title sequence amusingly quotes earlier "Herbie" pics to accompaniment of apt Beach Boys tune ("Getcha Back"), sounding a '70s nostalgic note that occasionally reprises in split-screen visuals, musical cues and some deliberately low-tech special effects. But characterization of thoroughly modern Maggie Peyton (Lohan) goes a long way toward giving familiar material a contempo spin.
Newly graduated from college, Maggie is bound for New York to accept an assistant producer gig at ESPN. Her career choice comes as great relief to her widowed father, Ray Peyton Sr. (Michael Keaton), a fading NASCAR champ who wants his less-than-promising son (Breckin Meyer), not his born-to-drive daughter, to carry on the family tradition of high-speed competition.
Before she can leave the West Coast, however, Maggie makes a fateful visit to an auto junkyard to procure low-cost transportation. That's where she spots Herbie, the magical VW Bug, in a sorry state of disrepair. Unaware of the car's miraculous powers, she buys the apparent clunker for $75. It doesn't take long for her to discover what a bargain she's found.
Indeed, Maggie wins a street race without really trying -- without really driving, actually -- when the mysteriously sentient Herbie takes her along for the ride while defeating an ultra-expensive rig driven by vainglorious champ Trip Murphy (Matt Dillon). Encouraged by Kevin (Justin Long), a mechanic friend and would-be suitor, Maggie contrives to continue racing without the knowledge of her disapproving father.
Naturally, since this is a G-rated Disney pic, nothing good comes of this deception. Just as naturally, however, resourceful Maggie and resilient Herbie have the right stuff to weather a few speed bumps -- including a detour through a demolition derby and a couple of grudge rematches with Trip -- on their way to the winner's circle.
Given the amount of tabloid coverage recently given to Lohan's offscreen travails, some people who have nothing better to do may peruse "Fully Loaded" for signs of the star's much-publicized physical gains and losses. (Insert joke about headlights here.) But vast majority of pic's target aud will pay little heed to such matters, and instead will enjoy the perky sincerity of Lohan's appealing perf as a young woman feeling her way through a coming-of-age transition that takes her from skateboarding to fast-tracking.
(For the record: "Herbie: Fully Loaded" is Lohan's third Disney remake or sequel, after 1998's "The Parent Trap" and 2003's "Freaky Friday.")
Not surprisingly, Herbie (and his various stand-ins, or drive-ins, or whatever) easily upstages all of Lohan's human co-stars. Still, it's worth noting that Keaton, Long and Dillon are thoroughgoing pros in roles that usually attract attention only when they're overplayed. Even as the sneering villain of the piece, Dillon tries to keep things real, giving a perf that is genuinely funny but effectively understated. Another standout, Jill Ritchie as Maggie's ditzy friend, is just comical enough in small doses.
Tech wizards led by visual effects supervisor John Van Vliet provide movie magic that, except for flashes of obvious CGI trickery, appear deliberately tamped down to better resemble look of earlier "Herbie" adventures. Sight gags involving Herbie's defense mechanisms (spurting oil, ejection seats, flapping doors, etc.) and expressive accessories (including a "smiling" front bumper) are old-school touches that, despite their familiarity, generate most of the laughs they're designed to get.

A true hole in the head, the new Aussie zombie farce Undead  revisits, yet again, the Romero template by way of early Peter Jackson : a small outback town, glowing meteors, growling mobile corpses, acting and writing conceived and executed as a form of gargoyle vaudeville. Quickly, the various characters are collected into a bickering mini-mob (including two warring beauty queens, a couple of gun-crazy cops, and a mysterious cowboy who shoots two-handed while doing flips), which retreats into a survivalist bomb shelter and then backs out again. As always, the walking dead are eliminated via head woundsafter 37 years, Romero's afterthought has come to have the immutability of a physical law. The most is made of the low-budget decapitations, if that's your idea of how to spend a ten-spot, and the tone veers from genuine attempts at Romero-ness to post Dead Alive  lampoon. Watching it is a smidgen like listening to the same monkey-walks-into-a-bar joke for the 105th time, but for the Spierig brothers, it is clearly a demonstration of fast-cheap capabilities and a one-way ticket straight out of Queensland .
