The wildest fantasy of every hamburger-happy kid is realized in this zippy, lippy animated adaptation of the popular children�s book. When a misunderstood inventor named Flint Lockwood (voiced by Hader) cooks up a contraption that converts water into food, causing all matter of epicurean delights to fall from the sky, he transforms overnight from town pariah to boy hero. Flint's invention first attracts the interest of a plucky meteorological anchor named Sam Sparks (Faris) and then incites a tourist boom to his down-on-the-luck fishing town of Swallow Falls. The town sign, missing the crucial �F,� reads Swallow alls, which is a dead-on description of any dead-end factory town whose one industry has dried up. The camera just glances past the sign; Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs
 is too teeming a visual feast to linger long on any one sight � not with a spaghetti tornado and a Jell-O funhouse to attend to � but it�s characteristic of the kind of smart, lightly snarky humor on display throughout. The sights are ingenious, impressively rendered in 3-D, and the sounds � including cheeky voice work by Mr. T, Harris, and Bratt � are a blast. All told, this is spirited play with unlabored lessons about good citizenship and the power of pluck that slide down as easily as the ice cream snowdrifts that blanket Swallow Falls.

Any movie based on a children’s picture-book is bound to be a feat of extrapolation, but taking on “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs’’ poses a special challenge. The 1978 book has a funny concept  - a town called Chewandswallow, where the food supply falls from the sky  - but no characters and little plot to speak of. Food drops, in ever more destructive weather patterns, but no one questions why.
So the new 3-D animated movie version essentially starts from scratch. We get a tiny island town called Swallow Falls, which lives well off the sardine trade until global sardine demand takes a serious downturn. And we get a protagonist, a nerdy young inventor named Flint Lockwood (the voice of Bill Hader), who is misunderstood by his father, Tim, a bait-and-tackle shop owner voiced with endearing gruffness by James Caan. Flint decides to save the town from depression by inventing a machine that converts water into food, and when his gizmo somehow winds up suspended in the sky  - just don’t think about it too much  - it starts raining cheeseburgers, hot dogs, and any other food that Tim orders from his computer.
At first, this is good for everyone, particularly an aspiring weather girl named Sam Sparks (Anna Faris), the town’s gluttonous mayor (Bruce Campbell), and the kids who get to enjoy a morning snowfall of ice cream. But the people get greedy, the portions get too large  - there’s a message about obesity here, but thankfully it isn’t pushed too hard  - and the machine, now overworked, 
starts going haywire.
The most impressive thing about this film is the vibrancy of its world, created by Phil Lord and Chris Miller, veterans of the animated TV series “Clone High.’’ The characters are carefully drawn in the metaphoric sense, and cast with the obligatory hipster cred: Andy Samberg plays “Baby Brent,’’ a grown-up slacker who’s still sponging off his fame as an infant sardine mascot; Mr. T plays a police officer who does acrobatics in short shorts; and Neil Patrick Harris provides the voice of Flint’s sidekick, a monkey named Steve.
There are occasional references to the book: a roofless restaurant, a pancake that falls atop a school, an enormous orange  Jell-O mold. But what’s striking, for any devotee of the print version, is how little this looks
 like the book. Ron Barrett’s detailed illustrations are distinctive and unique, but the movie arrives in a familiar, glossy style that makes the characters all look like bug-eyed plastic action figures. That’s not to say it isn’t beautiful at times, especially during scenes involving water or Jell-O. And the animators have great fun with the fake-fur look of Tim’s bushy eyebrows and mustache.
Still, it’s all very Hollywood, appealing but derivative, inspired by the likes of “Honey, I Shrunk the Kids’’ and every disaster movie ever made. As such, it might be a little scary for the smallest kids, who won’t take well to the concept of a giant ear of corn rolling toward them in 3-D. For everyone else, it’s engaging, perhaps a little too frenetic, and full of the expected lessons about being yourself and expressing your love. It’s not especially filling, but it leaves a pleasant aftertaste.

Talk about a high-pressure area. Judi and Ron Barrett's children's book has been tantalizing kids' taste buds for  30 years. So adapting the beloved  story into a 3-D flick was a risky move. Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs  goes down easy enough at first. But even at a svelte 81 minutes, this meal drags on too long (you'll be crying ''Basta! '' by the time it's raining pasta). Saturday Night Live 's Bill Hader is restrained as Flint, a nerdy inventor who transforms the sleepy town of Swallow Falls into a meteorological marvel where the skies pour pizza, burgers, and Gummi Bears. A nice turn from Mr. T keeps the grade (barely) above C level.

In a year in which Hollywood’s 3-D animated films have seemed to set the genius of Pixar’s “Up” against the dubious best of everything else, the impulse to take a break from computer-generated family fare is understandable. (Any urge to see “Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs” again? I thought not.) But then you’d miss “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs,” which takes its title and premise from the 1978 children’s book by Judi and Ron Barrett about a place where all types of chow rain down like manna. Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader) has been mocked since childhood for his failed inventions. His machine that converts water into menu items seems to offer redemption, as well as a way to score points with a cute weather  girl  (Anna Faris), until, of course, the technology runs amok, and a perfect storm of the four food groups threatens his town and beyond. This first animated feature by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, who cut their animation teeth writing the short-lived “Clone High” on MTV, spins a predictable tale of youthful ambition, love and the quest for approval, yet without leaving a sappy or snarky aftertaste. (Fathers, for example, don’t always know best, but sometimes they do.) Parents will enjoy tracking the endless stream of movie and television sendups. If the filmmakers opt to make only light statements about junk food, obesity and solid waste, they at least leave the audience sated on a single serving of inspired lunacy. “Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs” is rated PG (parental guidance suggested), presumably for its spaghetti twister and feral Gummi bears.

Tut tut, it looks like a hit for Sony Pictures Animation. Eye-popping and mouth-watering in one, "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs" spins a 30-page children's book into a 90-minute all-you-can-laugh buffet, expanding the premise of a town where it rains ketchup and hot dogs to disaster-movie proportions. With drooling tongues in cheek, tyro helmers Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (whose only previous directing credit was cult MTV toon "Clone High") bring a fresh, irreverent sensibility to bigscreen computer animation, using 3D projection to maximize their sky-is-falling scenario. This box office and concession-stand draw should make exhibitors very happy.
Considering Judi and Ron Barrett's high-concept picture book offers no characters beyond its narrator, Lord and Miller are to be commended for balancing their own originality with respect for the source (nearly all the book's key images, from a macaroni-headed bystander to the pancake-flattened school, survive the leap to screen). The story opens in Swallow Falls -- "a tiny island hidden under the A in Atlantic" on the map --�with Flint Lockwood (voiced by Bill Hader), a junior inventor whose gadgets have a way of going awry. Flint wants nothing more than to earn his father's approval, but Dad (James Caan, speaking almost entirely in fishing metaphors) wishes his son would just settle for running the family bait shop.
For years, Swallow Falls thrived on its booming sardine industry; then the world moved on to tastier options, leaving the mayor (Bruce Campbell) with no clue as to how to save the town. Fed up with fish, Flint invents a device that transforms water into any kind of food, and for once, the gizmo actually works (sort of). Launched into the sky above Swallow Falls, the machine sucks in clouds and spits out burgers, bacon and eggs -- whatever he wants -- showering chow upon the town, which becomes a major tourist destination overnight, changing its name to Chew and Swallow. On hand to document the meteorological anomaly is wannabe weather girl Sam Sparks (Anna Faris).
To deliver the initial meteorological spectacle, "Cloudy" appropriately steals Spielberg's signature eyes-wide, mouth-ajar reaction shot to build anticipation for a big reveal and repeats it for every major character on the island before finally showing the truly stunning burger-shaped cloud formation. Lord and Miller are savvy pop-culture sponges, synthesizing decades of film and TV viewing into a sensibility thirtysomething parents and their kids will embrace immediately (the casting of Mr. T as the town cop is particularly inspired, as is Mark Mothersbaugh's geek-chic score, positioned at the intersection of Bruckheimer fare and science fair).
Aesthetically, the plain character designs may not seem much to look at, but their elastic faces move like Muppets, while their Gumby-like bodies support a wide range of hilarious poses. Initially drab and gray, the environment erupts with color as soon as the weather turns tasty, featuring a palette that pops even more than "Up's" South American balloon ride (the photoreal food, meanwhile, dramatically expands on "Ratatouille's" menu).
The takeaway here is that it's OK to be a nerd, which applies not only to the young lovebirds (Sam is constantly apologizing for her brainy outbursts) but also the directors themselves, who tackle "Cloudy" like a thought experiment, taking a crazy idea and seeing it through to its philosophical conclusion. In this case, that means staging a giant aerial battle against the army of mutant food that has risen up to defend Flint's device -- a finale that evokes such sci-fi staples as "Independence Day" and "Star Wars," if the Death Star were a giant meatball.
Teetering just this side of haywire, the climax works (in 3D, at least) perhaps only by virtue of its visceral roller-coaster appeal. Both the father-son relationship and romantic subplot satisfy, but Lord and Miller are remiss to ignore a proper villain. (Flint's insubordinate invention echoes a red-eyed HAL, though the power-hungry mayor seems equally responsible for letting things get out of control.) The directors clearly privilege comedy over drama, and as the epic food fight winds down, they cleverly use various recurring gags to deliver a final emotional payoff.
Pic's visual design is staggering, featuring crowd sequences and a giant "foodalanche" that would have crashed the servers a few years back. The stereoscopic design is easy on the eyes yet playful with its use of space, yielding some of the most satisfying 3D viewing to date.
