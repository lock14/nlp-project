 Anyone popping in to "Psychopathia Sexualis" hoping for a classier "Basic Instinct" or perhaps a sneak peek at Woody Allen's memoirs will be sorely disappointed. Named for the notorious 1886 text by Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing, a German psychiatrist whose specialty was sexual perversion, the movie reconstructs four of the book's colorful case histories. But applying the scientific method to carnal behavior is one thing; applying it to moviemaking is quite another.  Trapping his kinky material in a cage of Victorian propriety, the writer and director, Bret Wood, mimics the visual style of silent cinema, complete with wooden tableaus and ornate intertitles.  As hysterical violins sob in the background, we see an onanistic mama's boy discover the joys of bloodsucking, and a wealthy masochist trampled by a pair of bored-looking prostitutes. There's necrophilia, and there are sheep (thankfully unmolested), but there is not one moment of fun.  Whether in the whorehouse or the sanitarium, "Psychopathia Sexualis" is an exercise in unrelenting dullness. Its troubled characters may clamber into coffins,  ogle chickens and play with leeches, but it's all pleasureless. Bodily fluids and whippings alike are delivered and received with no more enthusiasm than that of a bivalve processing its dinner. If Sharon Stone were to greet sexual deviance with such sang-froid, she'd never work again.

"Psychopathia Sexualis" exists in the gray area between ponderous stylization and campy affectation. Helmer Bret Wood employs an eclectic array of storytelling devices -- referencing everything from German Expressionism and silent cinema to puppet theater and true-crime reality TV -- in an ambitious but frequently risible attempt to dramatize case histories selected (seemingly at random) from the 19th-century medical research of Austrian psychiatrist Richard von Krafft-Ebing. Theatrical prospects are dubious at best, but there's definitely potential for specialty-market video sales. 
Wood attained notoriety with his docu "Hell's Highway" (2003), a sporadically shocking collection of highway safety films. With this feature, however, he takes a more subdued approach to the obsessions, maladjustments and misadventures of "sexually inverted" Victorians recorded by Krafft-Ebing.
Episodic pic has the look of a budget-strapped "Masterpiece Theater" miniseries, with Atlanta locales (primarily interiors) subbing for various European settings. But the stiff moves and flat line-readings of the actors (drawn mostly from regional stages) are on the level of historical re-enactments for a History Channel docu. As the thesps go through their motions, faintly disapproving commentators -- psychiatrists? historians? film critics? -- drone on the soundtrack.
Daniel May makes a creepy impression as a blood-lusting semi-invalid with a pronounced resemblance to the infamous somnambulist of "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." Bits and pieces of the character's story are scattered through the pic, leading to an ironic payoff. And Lisa Paulsen and Veronika Duerr struggle against the odds to inject genuine pathos into a soft-core episode about a love that dare not speak its name.
More often, however, "Psychopathia Sexualis" seems both plodding and snickering in its almost comically tepid rendering of masochism, homosexuality, necrophilia and, briefly, cruelty to animals. (The closing credits reassuringly note: "No chickens were harmed during the making of this film.")
Whatever the seriousness of Wood's original intent, his pic appears destined for screenings at times and places where viewers will feel free to provide their own running commentaries. Indeed, one can idly imagine audience members decked out in the make-up and costumes of their favorite characters, much like devotees of "The Rocky Horror Picture Show."

As reference book adaptations go, Psychopathia Sexualis  is hardly Everything You Always Wanted to Know about Sex* : The money shot does feature bared breasts, but they aren't giant, and alas they don't attack Woody Allen . Based on entries from a late-19th-century catalog of kinks, Sexualis 's narrative vignettes illustrate an array of "shocking" fetishes. The source material predates Freud, and it shows: The examples of deviant behavior include homosexuality, sadism, and domination by stiletto. Yet it's clear from the pedantic tone of the dramatic re-enactments (imagine an adult History Channel ) that writer-director Bret Wood  believes he's showing us the sexual revolution's Magna Carta. Wood's previous documentary was about highway safety films, and the ungainly rhythms of instructional cinema have obviously crept into his script. Question: "I take it that at that moment, your feelings toward this manÂ—your virility was restored?" Answer: "At that moment, I was in full possession of my virility." Drearily pretentious, Sexualis  has even less softcore appeal than an American Apparel  ad.
