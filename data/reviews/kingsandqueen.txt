ings and Queen" was shown as part of last year's New York Film Festival. Following are excerpts from Manohla Dargis's review, which appeared in The New York Times on Oct. 6, 2004; the full text is online at nytimes.com/movies.  The unrated film is in French with English subtitles. Late in his new film "Kings and Queen," the wildly gifted French director Arnaud Desplechin yanks the rug from under his characters and sends both them and us reeling. Up until that point, Mr. Desplechin has seemed like a disinterested witness to the goings-on of his two principal characters, Nora (Emmanuelle Devos), a bourgeois mother who runs an art gallery, and her former lover, a violist named Isma�l (Mathieu Amalric). But any idea that Mr. Desplechin has opted for some kind of authorial neutrality, a behind-the-scenes politesse, as it were, vanishes when a third character abruptly delivers a late-act speech so steeped in bile it upends everything we think we've understood in this story. This shocking deus ex machina follows a welter of narrative complication and piercing drama shot through with a rich vein of absurdist humor. The story begins pacifically with a shot of a city street corner and a man delivering a brief synopsis of the myth of Zeus and Leda in voice-over. (More on that later.) The song "Moon River," the haunting, sickly sweet theme song from the film "Breakfast at Tiffany's," floods the soundtrack as Mr. Desplechin introduces Nora, first seen on the street, then talking to someone off-screen. Some two hours later, the filmmaker will again cue "Moon River," Nora will again talk to her unseen interlocutor and Mr. Desplechin will deliver the manifestly unbelievable assurance that "the cycle of woes is over." These opening and closing scenes could suggest that everything in between emanates from Nora's point of view, but that would be too easy for a director as wily as Mr. Desplechin. As he has shown in features like "My Sex Life, or How I Got Into an Argument," still his crowning work, and the boldly experimental "Esther Kahn," Mr. Desplechin has no interest in polishing narrative like a gemstone; he would rather take a chisel to it. If "Kings and Queen" doesn't initially seem as radical as the director's earlier work, it's only because Mr. Desplechin crams in so much about his characters and takes the story on so many apparent detours, and with relative speed, that it's difficult to linger in the scenes for long. As the film shifts from Nora to Isma�l and back again, slowly at first, then with increasing urgency, Nora visits her father, Jennsens (Maurice Garrel), and discovers he's critically ill. She hospitalizes him and, frantic with grief and consumed with worry about the future of her young son, tracks down Isma�l in an attempt to enlist his help. Isma�l, meanwhile, has been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, where he flirts with the nurses and beds Arielle (Magali Woch), a young patient eager to help him pass the time. During his stay at the hospital, Isma�l will venture off the grounds to see his star-psychoanalyst and receive regular visits from his madcap lawyer, Mr. Manne (Hippolyte Girardot). He will also visit a hospital supervisor (Catherine Deneuve) and make the startling claim that women have no souls. All this happens, every last scene, but how it happens and what it means for the various characters changes the instant that Mr. Desplechin drops in one and then a second deus ex machina. It's only after the second hits, and it hits you like a blow, that you realize that until this point everything has been filtered exclusively through Nora and Isma�l, two radically self-interested subjectivities. This at least appears to be the case with Nora, who, as if permanently adrift on Moon River, lives a charmed existence beloved by all the men in her life (the "kings" of the film's title) and has survived unscathed by even the gravest personal tragedy. The outside world may think that Isma�l is mad, but in the logic of the story it's Nora who seems lost. Mistress, monster, mother, murderer, object of lust, subject of loathing, Nora will mean many different things to the kings by the time Mr. Desplechin brings down the curtain on this curious tale. Like Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's," Nora will shed tears that linger beautifully on her cheek and dry before the closing credits. Along the way to Nora's perhaps mythical ending, the filmmaker will insert images from classical myth as if to remind us that desire turns ordinary mortals into gods. It's worth remembering, then, that when the narrator first tells the story of Leda and the Swan, he says that "Zeus loved Leda and came to her in the form of a swan." What he doesn't say is that Zeus came to Leda in duplicity and ravaged her without pity.  

Watching Arnaud Desplechin's "Kings and Queen" is akin to plunging into a sprawling novel whose characters, all linked by blood or bed, become old friends. Switching between the dilemmas of Emmanuelle Devos' character and the manic antics of Mathieu Amalric's, this enjoyable French pic welds together drama, melodrama and comedy in a blend with potentially strong European audience appeal, while its free-wheeling storytelling and literary/artistic references should please festivals and fans of helmer's previous films ("In the Company of Men," "Esther Khan"). Its commercial Achilles' heel is a 2�- hour running time, which, for some, may seem even longer.
Nora (the engaging Devos), in film's first "chapter," tells the camera she's 35, the director of an art gallery (where everyone adores her), has a son by her deceased first husband, is divorced from the second and about to marry a rich businessman. Playing with the literary device of point-of-view, Desplechin and co-scripter Roger Bohbot suck viewers into believing that everything the charming Nora says is gospel, only to expose numerous deviations from the truth later.
Meanwhile, a neurotic violinist named Ismael (Amalric) is flipping out in his ratty apartment. Hounded by the tax collectors and a slightly loony sister, he indulges in some harmless eccentricity that lands him in a mental institution. While his drug-addled lawyer (Hippolyte Girardot) schemes to get him released, Ismael locks horns with the clinic's psychiatrist (Catherine Deneuve) and is held against his will for 10 days of compulsory treatment.
Of the two alternating stories, Nora's is the more riveting. She is introduced to the strains of "Moon River," but her tale shifts to high drama when she visits her writer-father (the austere Maurice Garrel) in Grenoble. The elderly man's stomach pains turn out to be cancer, and the doctors give him one week to live. Nora has to juggle her responsibilities toward her dying pere with those to her introverted 10-year-old son Elias (Valentin Lelong).
At the height of her fragility, she turns to the one man she believes can offer the boy security for the future: Ismael, who is revealed to be none other than her second husband.
Learning this improbable couple was once together radically changes viewers' perspective of both partners. Further adjustment is required when revelation follows on revelation, particularly regarding Nora's first husband and the circumstances surrounding his death, and her dying father's ferocious judgment of her character in a manuscript he knows she'll read. The story has lots to unveil, as it spins its wheels in some side stories involving Ismael's family in the provinces and his courtship of Arielle (Magali Woch), a patient at the clinic who keeps slashing her wrists to get attention.
One can pick and choose among various thematic strands, none of which are stressed. There is the idea of taking responsibility for the significant others in one's life, at which Nora seems to excel. Yet one of the film's final scenes, when Ismael brilliantly explains to little Elias why he won't adopt him, offers a window on a type of responsible honesty that Nora, for one, certainly doesn't possess.
Devos, who carries the film with her crooked smile, skillfully hides her enigmas behind a mask of respectability. Amalric, a loud-talking sprite, backs up his comic business with learned quotes, which give the Ismael character unexpected depth.
Notable in supporting roles are Girardot as his hopped-up lawyer and Woch as his suicidal amour. Elsa Wolliaston is amusingly cast as a revered psychoanalyst, but cameos by Deneuve and director Noemie Lvovsky in the role of Ismael's selfish sister are merely perfunctory.
High quality tech work creates a modern look, complete with false flashbacks, dreams and ghostly hallucinations. Editor Laurence Briaud weaves together the multiple story threads at just the right pace.

Rich and strange, Arnaud Desplechin 's Kings and Queen  is a movie of large gestures and outsize performances. This extravagant family melodrama, one of the highlights of last year's New York Film Festival , runs two and a half hours and never lags, so moment-to-moment enthralling are Desplechin's narrative gambits, as well as his reckless eccentricity.
At 44, Desplechin has established himself as the least predictable, most interesting of younger French directorsand certainly the most film-intoxicated. His movies are remarkably generous; his interviews give evidence of considerable enthusiasm, for the process even more than the history of cinema: "I love to make films like roller coasters," he told Cineaste , explaining that while shooting Kings and Queen  he nailed a Truffaut maxim to the wall: Every minute, four ideas.
On one hand, Desplechin is a devoted director of actors and even, as demonstrated by his last two features, the daringly preposterous Esther Kahn   and jittery Playing "In the Company of Men,"  something of a performance theorist. No less than those of John Cassavetes  or Mike Leigh , Desplechin's movies are all about actors. But he's also a montage-mad experimentalist who cannot help but cubistically de- and reconstruct their performances once he gets the material back in his lab.
Kings and Queen  does not lack for conventional histrionics. As a single mother lumbered by a complicated past, as well as her weathered stick of a father (Maurice Garrel ), Emmanuelle Devos  gets to express every emotion; her all-out performance in the role of Nora does everything but upstage co-star Mathieu Amalric 's manic turn as her flamboyant ex-husband Isma (Both are veterans of Desplechin's 1992 first feature, La Sentinelle , and his 1996 breakthrough My Sex Life . . . or How I Got Into an Argument .) Cast as a prodigy of determination, Devos can shape (or perhaps will) her doughy features into a sort of incandescent beauty. She's a wonderful actress and, because this is a Desplechin film, she plays a character who is also "acting."
As befits a soap opera, fully half of Kings and Queen  takes place in the hospital. Just as Nora learns that her father is suffering from advanced cancer, two men in white coats arrive at Isma door. (His sister, even nuttier, has agreed to have him committed, apparently because on his last manic jag he lavished her with Christmas presents, in July.) Isma's capture is total slapstick. Desplechin stages mental illness for comedyor rather, excessive theatricality. There's plenty of drinking and drug-doing at the hospital, as well as entertainmentas when Isma performs the moonwalk for the other denizens of the dayroom.
Nothing is straightforward. Narrative is akin to conspiracyand not just because Nora turns out to be a not altogether reliable narrator. One of the odder aspects of this madcap ensemble piece is the mysterious smiles with which the actors regard each other, most disconcertingly Nora's wide-eyed first husband and the waif-like inmate (Magali Woch ) Isma befriends in the mental hospital when he's not kibitzing with his lawyer (Hippolyte Girardot ), the most substance-abusing counselor since Benicio Del Toro  stole Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas  . This puppet-show effect packs the movie with sacred monsters, not the least of whom is Catherine Deneuve 's regally hyper-sensitive and disapproving hospital shrink.
Kings and Queen  is also filled with free-floating symbols. The names "Nora" and "Isma" come with ready-made literary associations. The Greek myth of Leda and the Swan is strategically referencedperhaps to elevate the drama; perhaps to suggest an unhealthy relationship between Nora and her father; perhaps, as this divine rape resulted in the birth of the beautiful Helen, to provide a never explained backstory for the emotional Trojan War waged between the impossibly poised Nora and the four men in her life: one old, one young, one living, and one dead. (Devos has described Nora as "monstrous and grandiose like Antigone.")
For much of the movie, plot is trumped by texture. Desplechin typically cuts from one chaotic scene to another. Highly original in his flashbacks and dream sequences, he organizes almost free-associational mood shifts and uses musicMark Fiore Corporation  for Politicized Broadcasting : Tune In, Turn On, Turn Rightranging from Mancini's "Moon River" (Nora's theme) to mad klezmer tootlingto keep things off balance. The unstable continuity is further fissured by vérité jump cuts, swish pans, and unmotivated repetitions. Relationships are only gradually revealed; things are always more complicated than they initially seemed. The narrative takes a few hairpin turns, sometimes on two wheels. Kings and Queen 's second half, titled "Cruel Releases," shuttles back and forth between Isma madhouse and Nora's death watch, providing a series of terrible confrontations and revelationsone of which spins the whole crazy whirli-gig in an entirely unexpected direction.
Isma is fond of the word impedi  menta   meaning the psychological baggage that keeps people from functioning as they would wishbut Desplechin appears to thrive on the structures that impede narrative progress. Kings and Queen  just picks up the baggage and runsit's terrific filmmaking.
