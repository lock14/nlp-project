         It took Arthur Golden 15 years to research and write "Memoirs of a Geisha," his bestselling novel set in 1930s and '40s Japan. It didn't take quite that long for the story to make it onto the screen, though the road was long and reportedly bumpy. The casting of Chinese actresses in the principal roles caused some grumbling in Japan, just as the all-Asian cast provoked some anxiety at the studios. Both concerns feel somewhat literal-minded and misplaced, though their double-edged tension could account somewhat for the film's seeming to unfold in an Orientalist daydream rather than an actual place and time. If the book was celebrated for its meticulous attention to historical detail, the movie's heart belongs strictly to Hollywood.
 
  Directed by Rob Marshall ("Chicago") and starring Ziyi Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Gong Li and Ken Watanabe, the story arrives in a flurry of snow and pink cherry blossoms, swathed in silk and carefully powdered and primped for its march down the red carpet. An extravagant, relentlessly gorgeous melodrama, "Geisha" luxuriates in its own exquisite weepiness, emerging after a long soak as a classic Cinderella story — a destitute but beautiful young girl named Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo) survives untold hardship to become Sayuri (Zhang), the most celebrated geisha of her day.
 


         






    If Golden's book lingered on the epochal tension of a subculture rooted in tradition at a time when tradition was being blasted away, the movie prefers to keep its eyes trained on the catty rivalries and casual cruelties that make up the life of a geisha-in-training.
 
  Marshall devotes some time to the schooling and rituals, but what really piques his interest are the behind-the-scenes power struggles that leave you with the impression of having watched "Mean Girls" in kimonos.
 
  Details get fudged to conform to Hollywood tropes and standards, so weird-looking chicks, like foreign languages (except for a prologue in Japanese), are out. Gone are the traditional stark white faces, rouged lower lips against white upper lips, shaved eyebrows repainted high on the forehead and matronly bouffants. The geishas have been sexified for Western consumption.
 
  The movie begins with a beautiful young girl named Chiyo being sold to an okiya,
 or geisha house, by her impoverished fisherman father. The house is run by the crusty, pipe-smoking Mother (Kaori Momoi) and the sweet, motherly Auntie (Tsai Chin), but it's ruled by Hatsumomo (Li), a geisha-diva as beautiful as she is despised. A teahouse legend, Hatsumomo does not appear to have let the years of geisha training get to her.
 
  At home, she skulks around in various states of dishabille, bed-hair hanging fetchingly over a single eye, snarling at everybody who gets in her way. There's a reason for the attitude: "It is not for a geisha to love!" we soon learn, but unfortunately for Hatsumomo, she already does. So, naturally, does Chiyo, from the very moment she meets the handsome Chairman (Watanabe) on a bridge and he buys her a treat. But it's not for a geisha to — well, you already know.
 
  The beautiful Zhang — who here possesses a pair of startling blue eyes that have the unfortunate effect of making her look glaucomatous — may grow up to be a superstar entertainer, but she might as well be listed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for the ease with which she's bought and sold.
 
  Thanks to Hatsumomo's scheming, she ends up indentured to Mother. She's then leased by the famous Mameha (Yeoh), another famous geisha with long, flowing hair, a sphinx-y smile and a cunning, sexual-political agenda.
 
  Playing Glinda to Hatsumomo's Wicked Witch of the East, Mameha decides to help Sayuri take the place of Hatsumomo at Mother's okiya,
 so that peace may come to the geishas of Gion. So she gets to work transforming Chiyo into Sayuri, auctioning off her virginity and promoting her as a consort to the gruff and disfigured Nobu (Kôji Yakusho).
 
  Rather than explore the tension between the geishas' public role as highly controlled, highly stylized "ideal women" and their personal desires, Marshall gives us three desperate teahouse "nocturnal wives," suffering one exquisite torment after another.
 
  A scene in which Sayuri is prepped for her teahouse debut is accompanied by warpath music. Beauty, as we're continually reminded, is pain.
 
  But then pain is beauty, and as "Geisha" swoons and flutters over every betrayal, near-miss and emotional torture that make up Sayuri's life, it's hard not to get swept up in the exquisite torment of it all. Besides, as my viewing companion remarked later, you put all those crazy women in one rice-paper house, emotions are bound to run high.
 
  "Geisha" presents a particularly American view, pitting tradition against self-realization. And it fails to illuminate what the book (as I remember it) seemed to, that geishas enjoyed a freedom and education that other Japanese women did not. In the context of the teahouse, they were able to enjoy a parity with men that was unavailable to wives and daughters.
 
  As central as they are to the geishas' lives, the men in the film are at best peripheral. "Memoirs" is a woman's picture in the most old-fashioned Hollywood sense. For all of Mameha's kindness to Sayuri, she remains an enigmatic figure with an agenda.
 
  Even Sayuri's innocent friend Pumpkin (Zoe Weizenbaum, and later Youki Kudoh), whose time spent among American soldiers has an unfortunate "Full Metal Jacket" effect on her speech, turns out to have claws. And the set-pièce de résistance
: a catfight in which Hatsumomo is given free reign to unleash her dormant Glenn Close.
 
  Spanning two decades and a momentous war, "Memoirs of a Geisha" displays all the pomp and grandeur of an epic, but you wouldn't call it sweeping.
 
  The story plays out in small rooms and smaller realms of possibility. It compensates for ratcheting up the emotion to operatic decibels and playing up the theatrics to the point of absurdity. (Sayuri's big moment comes when she performs a bizarre avant-garde dance on 10-inch platforms to what sounds like John Cage on the mandolin.)
 
  Strip away the silk and circumstance, and "Memoirs of a Geisha" is a titillating tear-jerker about virtue corrupted and innocence rescued by men of means.
 
  By the time Sayuri asks, "What do we know about entertaining Americans?" you want to say, "Honey, please, you've been doing it for two solid hours."

 Columbia Pictures, DreamWorks Pictures and Spyglass Entertainment present an Amblin Entertainment/Red Wagon Entertainment production. Directed by Rob Marshall. Screenplay by Robin Swicord.   

In Memoirs of a Geisha , a flatly picturesque prestige adaptation of the roundly handsome 1997 middlebrow literary bestseller by Arthur Golden, ubiquitous Chinese actress Ziyi Zhang, who plays the narrating Japanese geisha Sayuri, whispers in a delicate, meaningless voice-over that her world is ''as forbidden as it is fragile.'' Forbidden to whom? As fragile as what? The movie, directed by Rob Marshall with the same mass marketer's eye for shiny surfaces that he brought to Chicago , and written by Little Women 's Robin Swicord, arrives with refined manners and good breeding in a rustle of silk kimonos just in time for consideration during the middlebrow prestige-awards season. It's bound to win some. It's also a cinch to boost the sale of tie-in fashions and cosmetics. But not since Snow Falling on Cedars  have I seen so pedigreed a lit-pic sit there like such an inert teapot, available only to be admired for its mysterious, ineffable Asian teapotness.
The story traces Sayuri's rise from a poor, strikingly blue-eyed peasant girl called Chiyo, sold by her family into geishadom (with much throat-clearing explanation of the differences between the artistry of geishas and the tartistry of common prostitutes) to become the reigning artiste of her day. And in the beginning, the picture rushes forward (with none of the book's dawdling educational chitchat) on promising streams of tears pouring from young Chiyo (played with arresting feistiness by newcomer Suzuka Ohgo) and rivers of rainwater, gushing from the recurring motif of Sayuri's elementally watery, adaptable nature.
But just after the first, unsettling moment of sexual tension  when the weeping, rebellious little girl meets the much older gentleman known only as the Chairman (Ken Watanabe), who would become the secret object of her strangled, grown-up affections  Memoirs  loses its taste for risk, and settles, throughout the movie's subsequent melodramatic turns, for the familiar blandishments of good looks and technical control. Once Zhang appears in all her gorgeous porcelain opacity, the sad woman renamed Sayuri defies any further emotional penetration and the movie follows suit, an imitation of life. And there it remains, stoppered up, even while the old Japanese empire falls and traditions of chasteness give way to a coarser time. (In the unsubtle role of Pumpkin, Cedars star Youki Kudoh represents the bad new population of westernized modern Asian women.)
As Sayuri trains her powers, she is instructed by a mentor (Michelle Yeoh) and schemed against by a rival; in one girl-girl battle, she's clawed at by her nemesis, Hatsumomo, played in a shrieky fit of Geisha Dearest  by the great diva Gong Li; apparently it takes a village of Chinese movie stars to play Japanese women. Hairpins fly and obis go awry in this sleek production. And yet, inscrutably, no one and nothing gets touched.

 Swathed in silk and longing (mostly for a bald guy called Oscar), the big-screen version of "Memoirs of a Geisha" arrives with good intentions firmly in place. Based on the best seller by Arthur Golden, this lavishly appointed melodrama was directed by Rob Marshall, lately of "Chicago," and features the Chinese superstars Ziyi Zhang and Gong Li, and the Malaysian transplant Michelle Yeoh, as Japanese geishas swept up in jealous rivalries during the 1930's and 40's. In this cloistered world, men come and go as do history and warplanes, amid spectacularly unfortunate metaphors about male eels and female caves and one regrettably brief catfight in a kimono.  That catfight happens late in the story, long after Ms. Zhang's character, a geisha named Sayuri, has realized that the greatest obstacle to her happiness is an older star geisha, Hatsumomo (Ms. Gong). Sold to a geisha household, or okiya, as a child, Sayuri has long lived under the same roof as Hatsumomo, first as a prepubescent slave and then as a fully ripe rival. With her eye for beauty, Hatsumomo plots her challenger's demise with a ferocity that brings to mind both Joan Crawford and the Crawford impressionist Faye Dunaway in all their nostril-flaring, no-wire-hangers intensity. Clare Boothe Luce, who wrote "The Women," a poison-pen letter to her sex that became one of Crawford's more famous and least agreeable vehicles, would have approved.  Originally published in 1997, Mr. Golden's celebrated venture into higher-end chick lit centers on Sayuri, who survives a childhood of suffering to become a famous entertainer. Narrated in the first person, the book is embroidered with vaguely ethnographic exotica, Japanese words and phrases and a great deal of hothouse intrigue about who did what to whom and where. To the non-Japanese eye, the life of the geisha may appear intoxicatingly exotic, perfumed with face powder and the mildest suggestion of sex, but at least in the film, which is credited to the screenwriter Robin Swicord, the whole thing plays out like "As the Okiya Turns," complete with devious rivals, swoonworthy swains, fabulous accouterments, a jaw-dropping dance number recycled from Madonna's Drowned World tour and much clinching, panting and scheming.  Then again, there isn't all that much for a geisha to do other than serve and conspire. Rigorously trained from childhood, geishas dedicate themselves wholly to the paid amusement of male customers. Once upon a time in Japan, some women were in the service of procreation, others were employed for recreational sex, while the geisha operated in that gray area in between. (Curiously, the first geishas were men.)  Geishas aren't typical sex workers; they're superclassy sex workers who sell their virginity to the highest bidder  (the pretext in both the book and film for that unhappy bit about eels and caves) and rely on steady male patronage. But while serving a new customer every six months certainly sounds less untoward than, say, turning six tricks a night in a day-rate motel, who's kidding whom?  The book and the film attempt to attenuate the more distasteful aspects of geisha life, mostly by avoiding the contradiction between its degradations and its glamorous trappings. The story, after all, opens in the 1920's  with Sayuri, then age 9 and called Chiyo (Suzuka Ohgo), and her older sister being sold by their impoverished fisherman father and spirited away into the dark, rainy night. The girls are soon separated, with the older sister sold to a low-end brothel and the future geisha sold to her okiya, a beehive of female activity run by a pair of crones cum pimps and supported by the labor of its clipped-wing queen, Hatsumomo. Legally bound to the crones, to whom she must hand over most of her wages, Hatsumomo hopes to secure her future by one day running the okiya.  The exquisite Ms. Gong  looks like a gift that keeps on giving when trussed up in silk, but she and the film come most alive when her hair tumbles down and she sashays about the okiya, stirring the air with her tremulous rage. Having seen a very different future for herself in the gray eyes of the new girl, Hatsumomo directs all that fury toward her eradication. In time, this enmity will assume soap-operatic proportions and involve the rival geisha Mameha (Ms. Yeoh), who takes Sayuri on as a trainee, and the two businessmen whose attentions consume so much of the women's and the story's time: the Chairman (Ken Watanabe, the majestic hunk from "The Last Samurai") and his partner and friend, Nobu (the great Japanese actor Koji Yakusho).  Mr. Marshall can't rescue the film from its embarrassing screenplay or its awkward Chinese-Japanese-Hollywood culture klatch, but "Memoirs of a Geisha" is one of those bad Hollywood films that by virtue of their production values nonetheless afford a few dividends, in this case, fabulous clothes and three eminently watchable female leads. Although it's always a pleasure to see these three in action, and there's something undeniably exciting about the prospect of them storming the big studio gate, the casting of Ms. Gong and Ms. Zhang ends up more bittersweet than triumphant. Ms. Zhang, for one, shows none of the heartache and steel of her astonishing performance in Wong Kar-wai's "2046." When her character crumbles with desire in that film, Ms. Zhang's face seems to break into pieces - you can scarcely believe she could put it whole again. Here, you can hardly believe it's the same actress.  Ms. Gong's hauteur and soaring cheekbones work better for her character, a woman of acid resolve. Although there are moments when Hatsumomo comes perilously close to Dragon Lady caricature ("I will destroy you!"), the actress's talent and dignity keep the performance from sliding into full-blown camp. But even the formidable Ms. Gong cannot surmount the  ruinous  decision to have her and Ms. Zhang, along with the poorly used Mr. Yakusho, deliver their lines in vaguely British-sounding English that imparts an unnatural  halting quality to much of their dialogue.

In their great geisha dramas, Mikio Naruse  and Kenji Mizoguchi  bring an unblinking focus to the everyday realities of being a working woman: Naruse's Flowing  (1956) is a crystalline portrayal of the okiya  (geisha house) as a vanishing microcosm and a declining business. Arthur Golden 's 1997 Memoirs of a Geisha an exhaustively researched novel masquerading as an insider's tell-allemphasizes exotic ritual: laborious face painting and masochistic hairdos, virginity auctions and patronage systems. The movie version of Golden's bestseller, from the director of Chicago , comes up with a new angle: In this garish pageant of dragon-lady vamping and drag-queen catfights, the geisha experience is roughly akin to working the bar at Lucky Cheng 's.
Swaddled in the posh vulgarity that passes for awards-season elegance, Memoirs  is deluxe orientalist kitsch, a would-be cross between Showgirls  and Raise the Red Lantern , too dumb to cause offense though falling short of the oblivious abandon that could have vaulted it into high camp. While Golden's book was praised as a persuasive feat of ventriloquist empathy, Rob Marshall 's movie is something of a lip-synch disaster: Chinese actresses play Japanese geisha (in a period concurrent with the Sino-Japanese war) and speak English the way Hollywood  has always imagined Asians do, all stilted syntax and awkward enunciations ("You are! To become! Geisha !"). Golden coyly framed his novel as a translated autobiography, and the author invented for his stereotypical model of Eastern femininity an accordingly docile voice. The movie at least drops any pretense of authenticity, supplanting the whispery "Asianness" of Golden's prose with the heavy breathing of a filmmaker who goes weak-kneed at the merest glimpse of silk brocade.
Against the color-coded tumult of flicked fans and twirled umbrellas, the slenderness and predictability of Golden's fiction becomes painfully apparent. Drained of all anthropological value and incongruously imbued with Chicago 's rancid showbiz cynicism, Memoirs  is recast as an aspirational melodrama. Sold into an okiya in childhood, mysteriously blue-eyed Sayuri (Ziyi Zhang ), often shot through bars and slats in case we fail to grasp her caged condition, longs to escape servitudeto become! geisha !which she does under the tutelage of the kindly Mameha (Michelle Yeoh ) and despite the vengeful plotting of the slatternly Hatsumomo (Gong Li ). She also yearns, somewhat creepily, for true love with a generous big shot known as the Chairman (Ken Watanabe ), whom she meets as a prepubescent. And in the scheme of this movie, which dispenses with pesky World War II in one or two sonorous voiceover lines, what Sayuri wants, Sayuri gets.
"What do we know about entertaining Americans?" one geisha asks another, rallying to put on a postwar show. It's also Marshall's foremost concern, of course, and as he can attest, Americansor at least Academy votersare gluttons for that old razzle-dazzle. In this back-lot Kyoto , which seems to have been achieved by plopping down some pointy Asian roofs on the set of Chicago , something is always falling from the sky: rain, snow, and on special occasions, cherry blossoms. The overall aesthetic could be approximated by turning on a wind machine in a Chinatown souvenir emporium. With Marshall preoccupied picking out fabrics and lacquer veneers, the task of directing the actors seems to have fallen to the beleaguered dialect coach. To complement the clashing accents, Memoirs  is a free-for-all of wildly divergent acting styles. Zhang's phonetic struggles are the most (mis)pronounced, but she throws herself heartily into the film's hilariously anachronistic big number, a splashy expressionist routine on platform clogs that would have cleaned up on So You Think You Can Dance ?
The supporting actors, who include some of Asia's biggest stars, mount savvier defense strategies. Poised as ever, Yeoh seems to be meditating as much as acting, creating a zone of Zen self-containment. In a quietly subversive turn, charismatic Koji Yakusho , despite sporting a decorously scarred cheek, makes rival suitor Nobu a more enticing romantic prospect than the Chairman. Best of all, Gong uncorks a broad, gestural performance that both captures the spirit of the movie and signals her superiority to it. Memoirs  scans as round two in the battle of the Zhang Yimou  leading ladies, carried over from 2046 , and this bout also goes to Gong. Clad in chinchilla-fringed outfits and hurling sidelong death glares, Gong's viperous Hatsumomo wipes the floor with Zhang's cowering Sayuri: "I shall destroy  you!" she hisses in the most Showgirls -like scene. What's more, she doesn't overstay her welcome. Hatsumomo's dramatic exit seems to sum up Gong's attitude toward the film: She torches the place and defiantly strides away from the smoldering wreckage.
