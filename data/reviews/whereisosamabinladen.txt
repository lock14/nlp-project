The last time we saw Spurlock, he was nursing a rapidly deteriorating liver and an even more rapidly expanding waistline in Super Size Me
, his first-person, toxic trip through the darkest reaches of our fast-food culture. That film made him a star and established the blueprint for his peculiar brand of cinematic muckrakery � refined on his FX TV show 30 Days
 and now given geopolitical heft with Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?
: Armed with little more than a camera, a healthy sense of humor, and an unhealthy amount of moxie, Spurlock throws himself into situations most of us would spend a lifetime trying to avoid, all in the name of finding out what life is really like outside our own tiny existences. Where in the World
 finds Spurlock worlds away from everyday American existence, traveling through the Middle East on a quest to find (and presumably capture) the most wanted man on the planet. His reasoning is simple enough: With his wife about to give birth to their first child, he wants to make an unsafe world a little safer. That the CIA, Pakistani armed forces, and God knows how many freelance bounty hunters have failed to find the al Qaeda leader seems to be of no concern to Spurlock; he figures � based on a lifetime of action-movie viewing � that when you want something dangerous done right, you always send one man � one brave and probably certifiable man � to do it. Traveling through Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan, and eventually Pakistan, Spurlock proves himself to be just that man; he�s a whirlwind of fearless good cheer, who charms burqua-clad women, destitute Palestinians, and radical anti-Western clerics into candid conversations about the nature of violent Islamic extremism and cultural misunderstanding, learning along the way that � despite all accounts to the contrary � the differences between and Us and Them are really pretty minimal. Few of the locals he encounters, for example, espouse the values of radical jihad or revere bin Laden, though even fewer sympathize with American foreign policy; like most of us, the majority of Muslims fall into the great, golden middle that just wants to be left alone. Or, as one Afghan man poetically puts it: �Fuck Osama bin Laden. And fuck America.� So kudos to Spurlock for going into enemy territory and coming back with the message that there really is no enemy territory. It almost � almost � makes up for the fact that Where in the World
 is marred by one of the worst endings in movie history. �Anticlimax� doesn�t begin to describe the cosmic, catastrophic letdown that this film whimpers into. I won�t give anything away here, but suffice it to say that watching a man slink away from his appointed rounds after nearly two hours of anticipation feels like grand betrayal, like the compact between filmmaker and viewer has been torn and burned and its ashes scattered to the wind.


It's possible that documentary personality Morgan Spurlock thinks the world of the people watching his movies. But he treats them like children. I don't mention this because his first movie since "Super Size Me" happens to be called "Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?," a riff on the title of a children's game and TV show, but because when he's talking to us in the movie's narration there's a lot of gee-whiz in his voice. Treating us like children would be more insulting if Spurlock didn't behave like a child himself.
In his defense, he's got babies on the brain. In "Osama," his wife is expecting. And lest we think her pregnancy should be all about her, Spurlock manufactures a crisis. He claims to be worried about bringing a child into such a violent and chaotic world. So he flies to North Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia hoping to find the man symbolically responsible for all this instability. He's kidding and he's not. The name of his mission is "Operation Special Delivery," and the film is broken down by country and, as a tribute to video games, divided into rounds. The game's object is to finish the trip before Mrs. Spurlock delivers.
Spurlock interviews regular Egyptians and Moroccans and Palestinians and Saudis. A group of Hassids curse and shove him. He inexplicably dons traditional Arabic garments and walks around a mall in Riyadh asking whether anybody has seen you-know-who. Spurlock and his team of collaborators never find the movie amid all their material. If he's a questionable journalist and a poor detective, he's an even more woeful filmmaker. I was not a fan of Albert Brooks's "Looking for Comedy in the Muslim World" (2005), but Brooks, at least, seemed willing to concede before it was over that his movie was a terrible idea.
Spurlock seems opportunistically optimistic. In one sequence, he swoops into the ruins of a Sderot schoolhouse hours after a bomb has hit it. Sitting at a desk amid debris he tells the camera that he can't imagine raising his child in this kind of environment. Then there's a cut to his wife back in New York doing yoga to remind us that he won't have to. From there it's back to Israel for a ride-along with the police, who look into a bomb-scare while Spurlock cranks generic Hollywood thriller music on the soundtrack. When it's over he pals it up with the remote-controlled robot tasked with opening the suspicious package.
These are the kind of glib stunts Michael Moore - Spurlock's cosmic mentor - might have been able to get away with. Moore is a clever filmmaker who can gird a movie with enough dramatic structure, human feeling, and personal gall to play the farceur. Spurlock doesn't have Moore's talent for mockery or his capacity for compassionate outrage. Mostly though, Spurlock's earnest enlightenment is unconvincing. All that manages to grow appreciably on him during this adventure is a beard.


What would it take to draw people into a documentary about the post-9/11 world? Here are a few things that, by now, probably won't work: intricate layered craftsmanship; a spirit of inquiry; an excavation of the lies that have trickled down from the top levels of American power; a look at the devastation (torture, maimed soldiers, grieving families) on the ground; disturbing doses of information, outrage, truth. Nope, that's been done, and it hasn't gotten far. Enter Morgan Spurlock, who in Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?  tries a different tack. In his first film since Super Size Me , Spurlock tells you virtually nothing you didn't already know  and, what's more, he does it with catchy videogame graphics (Osama boogying to ''U Can't Touch This'') and faux-naive man-on-the-street interviews that make Michael Moore look like Chet Huntley. The movie, in other words, is so glib and shallow and facile it just might work at the box office.
Where in the World  isn't really about the hunt for bin Laden. Once you get past the title, it's little more than a feeble, once-over-lightly tour of the Middle East, as Spurlock  now an expectant daddy fretting over the state of the world  pays visits to Egypt, Morocco, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, trying to suss out the feelings of the citizens there. Did you know that the war in Iraq has been a boon to al-Qaeda? That a lot of folks in Arab Muslim countries have no beef with ordinary Americans but deplore our government? That Saudi Arabia limits freedoms on speech, women's dress, and religion? These and other shattering insights are offered up as if they were news; Spurlock's gaga investigative zeal makes him come off here like a boob who spends too much time at the health-food store and not enough time reading the papers. When a bunch of Hasidim on a Jerusalem sidewalk start yelling at him to go home, and he's forced to scurry for cover, his attitude is at once smug and starry-eyed, sealed with a Can't we all get along?  shrug. A primer no one needed, Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?  should have been called The Post-9/11 World for Dummies .
In Standard Operating Procedure , the latest from Errol Morris (The Fog of War ), we see those grinning, thumbs-up American soldiers from the Abu Ghraib photographs  like Lynndie England  explain themselves with a potent sense of what was expected of them from the powers above: to ''soften up'' prisoners for the real  torture to follow. Morris, using a welter of photographs (many of which we haven't seen), constructs a day-to-day sense of how Abu Ghraib descended into a medieval hell. He reveals the institutionalized fear, the pornographic license that ruled a prison where degradation became the blinkered language of American payback. The most chilling thing about the film, however, is how hard it is to completely separate yourself from those guilty U.S. soldiers. Now who in the world would want to go see that? Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?:  C- ; Standard Operating Procedure: 

 “Where in the World Is Osama bin  Laden?” is not so much a documentary as the movie equivalent of a nonfiction stunt book. You know the kind I mean: An author spends a year doing something just nutty and topical enough to earn a nice advance and shares the resulting insights with the public. And indeed Morgan Spurlock, the director of this film, has also written a tie-in volume that recounts, in somewhat greater detail than the movie, his half-joking search for the world’s most notorious terrorist.  Mr. Spurlock, whose experiment with an all-McDonald’s diet was the subject of his first film, “Super Size Me,”  is a friendly, energetic fellow who makes strenuous use of those qualities. At the beginning of “Where in the World” he discovers that he is about to become a father, news that inspires him to leave his pregnant girlfriend in New York and set off on a hopscotching, sometimes hair-raising journey across North Africa and the Middle East.  Not because he is fleeing paternal responsibility, mind you, but because he wants to fulfill the basic fatherly duty of keeping his impending child safe by capturing a major threat to his well-being. The facetiousness of this project is charming at first — as is the conceit of depicting the hunt for Mr. bin Laden using video-game animation — but the charm wears off pretty quickly. Mr. Spurlock travels from Egypt to Morocco and then to Israel, Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan, asking if anyone knows where Mr. bin Laden might be and following up with slightly less inane questions.  The information he uncovers will astonish just about anyone who has managed to get through the years since Sept. 11, 2001, without opening a book or a newspaper, or for that matter seeing any of the dozens of more sober-minded, better-informed documentaries that deal with terrorism, American foreign policy, Islam and related matters. Even though we Americans are, according to Mr. Spurlock, conditioned by “the media” to regard all Muslims as violent extremists, he discovers that a lot of them are actually quite nice. Also, you may be interested to learn, the Israelis and Palestinians don’t get along so well, and there are a lot of problems in Afghanistan.  Who knew? Not Mr. Spurlock, apparently, who serves as his own straw man, repeatedly debunking his own disingenuous prejudice or naïveté. Wherever he goes, he finds people who respond to his amiable, good-humored questions with smiles and platitudes. There are, to be sure, a few exceptions. He hears a virulently anti-American, anti-Israel  sermon in a Saudi mosque, and the repressiveness of that country freaks him out a little. And he receives a hostile welcome in an ultra-Orthodox neighborhood in Israel, where the residents greet his inquiries with shouts and shoves.  He does not stick around long enough to explain that their behavior has more to do with tensions within Israeli society than with the Global War on Terror, but in general he’s less interested in analysis than in genial chats and easy jokes. His method — keeping himself on camera, button-holing strangers in the street, overdoing the folksiness — makes comparison with Michael Moore inevitable, but the difference is that Mr. Moore’s aw-shucks persona and ambush tactics advance a definite political point of view.  In contrast Mr. Spurlock, more so here than in “Super Size Me,” advances an essentially anti-political view of the world. It’s impossible to disagree with much of what he says in “Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden,” but it’s also impossible to learn anything about war, terrorism, religion, oil, democracy or any of the other topics a less glib, less self-absorbed filmmaker might want to tackle.  But maybe thinking about that kind of stuff would prevent us from grasping that we all just need to be nicer to one another. “I’m not saying we should all sit around the campfire singing ‘Kumbaya,’ ” Mr. Spurlock says. “That would be ridiculous.” Indeed it would. As a more practical alternative he suggests that we need to realize that the good folks of the world outnumber the bad ones and to celebrate the things we all have in common, like our children and our families and our desire for a better world. So true! But also, and more to the point: So what?  “Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has references to terrorism, war and other forms of violence.

With about as much documentary credibility as "Borat," "Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?" combines low comedy, high production values and the Middle East for what will surely be a hit, even as it delivers nothing new -- let alone the world's most elusive terrorist. Morgan Spurlock, of the "Super Size Me" phenom, serves up a rehash of others' 9/11 reportage, bin Laden biography, Islamic theology and suicide-bomber psychology, in a tone so aghast you'd assume he knew nothing about the War on Terror -- which should make pic very appealing for those who know nothing about the War on Terror.
Punctuated throughout by animation portraying bin Laden and Spurlock as videogame nemeses, the film begins with Spurlock, after learning his wife is pregnant, reacts drastically -- by leaving home for the most troubled region on Earth. His reasoning: For his child to grow up in a safe world, he needs to find the world's most wanted man.
If this were treated throughout for what it is, a joke, the film might have worked as comedy, which it occasionally does. But Spurlock, morphing into a kind of Katie-Couric-on-growth-hormones, decides he's a goodwill ambassador for the United States.
Wandering from Muslim country to Muslim country, he sets out to validate his premise that Arabs are just like us, or at least more like us than they are like bin Laden. This is not hard to prove, since Spurlock has no method and no accountability. He's not a journalist, but he plays one, even while violating the commandment against having conclusions first and proving them later.
On his whirlwind tour, Spurlock interviews normal people who all affirm his Rodney King-like premise that we all just want to get along. But why are we watching Spurlock interview anyone? The idea is ludicrous, but not ludicrous enough -- he takes himself far too seriously, even while displaying righteous indignation in a manner that paints him as a cliched, uninformed American: Sitting in a just-shelled classroom�in Israel, he talks about how awful it is to grow up where bombings are a daily threat. And we thought it was bin Laden who was living in a cave.
In one of his few unpleasant encounters, Spurlock barges into an ultra-orthodox Israeli neighborhood and is confronted, insulted and eventually driven out by locals angered either by his questions or his non-Jewishness. Or maybe they saw "Super Size Me." Regardless, Spurlock remains until a crowd grows, police have to be called and things get physically violent. It's juvenile, calling into question his motives and his sense of discretion.
"Where in the World Is Osama Bin Laden?" doesn't really know what it wants to be. It's a comedy, a political essay, a rumination on incipient fatherhood (yes, we get to see Spurlock's baby being born) and a naif's-eye survey of current events. The film could have served as a primer on the past 50 years of U.S.-Mideast history and post-9/11 developments if its flippancy didn't disqualify it as such. People used to get upset about Jesse Jackson or Jimmy Carter operating in the sphere of foreign policy; imagine what they'll think of Morgan Spurlock, who, if he's so worried about America's image being tarnished abroad, might consider staying home.
Tech credits, including the overtly silly animated sequences, are first-rate.

Morgan Spurlock , the daredevil documentarian who lived on Big Macs for a month and turned this exercise in "body art" into the 2004 hit Super Size Me , returns—this time expanding his horizons rather than his girth. Paraphrasing the title of a venerable computer game, Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden ?  presents Spurlock's fact-finding tour of the Middle East and beyond.
An affable action hero in search of the planet's arch supervillain, Spurlock is less irritating than his obvious model, Michael Moore , but also less politically astute; assuming the role of a faux-naïf stranger in a strange land, he's more benign and not nearly as funny as unacknowledged analogue Sacha Baron Cohen . Actually, Spurlock's trip is something of a charm offensive, and Spurlock himself is a relentless personalizer. His pursuit of bin Laden arose from his new family situation: Mrs. Spurlock—or, as she is characterized in the press notes, "vegan wife Healthy Chef Alexandra Jamieson"—is pregnant. Impending fatherhood has rocked Spurlock's world, stimulating his sudden concern for its perilous state.
A cynic might view Spurlock's seven-month exploration of civilization's cradle as a form of conjugal competition: Operating from a position of feigned total ignorance, the filmmaker too must undertake a particular regimen—exercises, self-defense lessons, medical attention—in order to bring something new into being, namely this movie and its published memoir-ization. But Spurlock's own education aside, the real question is whether there is actually anything particularly new to be gleaned from the travelogue that is Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden ?
Spurlock lands first in Egypt , hoping to interview the uncle of bin Laden's mentor, Ayman Al-Zawahiri , and thus understand the Al Qaeda  mindset. Uncle declines to talk, but Spurlock has no difficulty finding schoolgirls who think America is at war with Egypt, or religious zealots who tell him: "We pray to heaven to destroy you." Others are more moderate: Spurlock is invited to dinner by a friendly Moroccan family; in the West Bank , he finds Palestinians who reject, and even denounce, bin Laden, as well as an Israeli who foresees a rational settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Soon after, Spurlock visits an ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem  neighborhood where, rather than respond to his friendly inquiries, the local Haredim chase away his crew. Surely it couldn't have been his hardball questions.
Theocratic culture shock is even more severe in bin Laden's native Saudi Arabia , which, according to Spurlock, makes every other Arab state seem "progressive by comparison." This sequence is most illuminating precisely because nothing is revealed, whether Spurlock is touring an austere, strictly burqa'd shopping mall, searching for bin Laden's family farm, or interviewing a pair of high-school students. Asked how they view the United States, the kids decline to express any opinion at all; when Spurlock switches gears to inquire what they are taught about Israel , the school official who is monitoring the exchange leaps into action: "Stop your camera!" The structuring absence, however, is not Saudi Arabia but Iraq—the never-mentioned realm that the Bush administration and its ideological allies magically transformed into bin Laden's spiritual home. Spurlock knows enough not to look for Osama there.
Where in the World  is enlivened by educational animations, snazzy graphics, and mock music videos (OBL merged with MC Hammer , dancing to "U Can't Touch This"). And, unlike the terrorist trading cards that are periodically flashed, there's a War on Terror computer game that has a definite commercial future. Nevertheless, conventional wisdom rules: The Afghans claim that bin Laden is hiding in Pakistan ; the Pakistanis reveal that the devil is actually in Afghanistan . It's there that Spurlock has his most enjoyable moment, allowed by American troops to fire a rocket launcher into the rubble. It's also amusing to learn that he's not the only celebrity opportunist—a local politician hopes to develop Tora Bora  as a tourist site.
So, will this all-American self-identified goofball achieve the scoop of the century, penetrate the Forbidden Zone, and track Osama to his lair? Can he make it back to Brooklyn  in time for the birth of his child? Not exactly suspenseful, this is a movie where human interest rules: Like a novice teacher staying a lesson plan ahead of his class, Spurlock is prepared for the day he can teach little Laken James Spurlock that people are people wherever you go.
