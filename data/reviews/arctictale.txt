What might be the only thing better than An Inconvenient Truth  at getting  people to care about global warming? Maybe those widely circulated photos of drowning polar bears stranded between melting ice floes. Arctic Tale   a nature doc following a walrus and a polar bear  lacks single images of that power, and it's too sneaky about the fact that both ''characters'' are in fact composites, but it's a respectable  attempt to get kids who like cuddly animals thinking about death and destruction on a global scale.

 Displaying more corn than is usually found at the North Pole, “Arctic Tale” documents the travails of a polar bear cub and a walrus pup as they struggle toward adulthood on diminishing quantities of ice.  Cute of face and name, fuzzy Nanu and sleek Seela (played by a variety of animals at different stages of life) dodge predators and heed their mommies while the filmmakers, Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson, spin a global-warming-for-tykes theme around their endangered bodies. This being an American family movie, the pop songs and unbridled flatulence are givens.  Assembled from more than 800 hours of film shot at the Arctic Circle over the last 15 years, this National Geographic production (written in part by Al Gore’s daughter Kristin) uses its narrative artifice to serve the greater good. And if you can get past Sister Sledge belting “We Are Family” over a herd of frolicking walruses — whose mating calls sound a lot like Tom Waits after venturing to the heart of Saturday night and back — the movie’s stunning underwater photography (fearlessly captured by Mr. Ravetch) effectively dilutes the saccharine  tone.  Still, adults may squirm at the film’s persistent anthropomorphism and Queen Latifah’s cloying narration. “Meanwhile, Seela’s tusks have filled out nicely, and the boys are taking notice,” she observes. And if “the boys” are anything like their human counterparts, I’ll bet they have no idea what color her eyes are, either.

Paramount Vantage is hoping auds will be as bullish on bears and walruses as they were on "March of the Penguins," although it remains to be seen if they will warm to "Arctic Tale," an expertly assembled docu with an underlying message about multiple species threatened by man's pigheaded behavior. National Geographic imprint ensures the pic will, in any case, have long, healthy life in tube and video preserves.
Married helmers Adam Ravetch and Sarah Robertson spent six frigid years following various animals through harrowing seasonal changes, with special focus on a newborn polar bear, Nanu, and a baby walrus, Seela. The anthropomorphism is relentless, as animal communities are mined for their most recognizably human characteristics -- not hard to do, given the outsized personalities of the main subjects.
Some realistic deaths add a tragic dimension, although there's more emphasis on in-the-wild comedy; when all else fails, a film can always rely on walrus farts for easy giggles.
Al fresco carnality is notably absent -- and is perhaps the only reason the filmmakers omit "You Sexy Thing" from the soundtrack, especially when they manage to slip in "Celebrate" and "We Are Family" during a 10-minute seg. Elsewhere, there are crowd-pleasing tunes from Cat Stevens, Aimee Mann and the Shins to help underscore the gorgeous, blue-tinged lensing, while the lush orchestral music sticks to Disneyesque pomposity.
Queen Latifah proves an amiably authoritative narrator, and is allowed more personality than most script readers; Morgan Freeman never told his penguins they'd "best be goin'." (Co-writer Kristin Gore, Al Gore's daughter, is the only connection to Par Vantage's similarly themed docu hit, "An Inconvenient Truth.")
Beth Spiegel's editing is the sharpest achievement here, with extremely smooth transitions connecting protagonists over great distances and sometimes time periods. Attentive viewers will eventually realize many of the principal critters rarely or never appear in the same frame, although clever assembly suggests otherwise. Some of the bestand least programmatic moments are interludes featuring other species, such as shots of jellyfish floating underwater, or an overhead sweep of a channel filled with migrating dolphins.
Drama is heightened by the undeniably frightening changes in weather patterns over the past few years. Overall effect, regardless of aesthetic quibbles or kudos, is to make auds aware of how imminent the risk is to these environmentally interdependent creatures.

A smarmy score, some orgiastic farting from a herd of walruses, and a modicum of cutesy anthropomorphism from narrator Queen Latifah  prove a small price to pay for this stunningly photographed narrative documentary about a year in the endangered life of Arctic ice floe. With 15 years of experience in the area, Adam Ravetch  and Sarah Robertson  shoot around, inside, and underneath the compromised habitat of Nanu, a polar bear cub, and Seela, an enchanting walrus calf weighing several hundred pounds, as they try to survive in a hunting ground that may lose all of its ice by the year 2040 if we don't mend our anti-green ways. The movie's bracing account of animal domestic lifealtruistic and predatory in equal measureand the sheer diversity of family forms (bear cubs are raised by single mothers, walruses by mothers and self-sacrificing "aunts") may be enough to place it on the evangelical right's shit-list. The most heartbreaking moment comes when, two years ahead of developmental schedule, Nanu's hitherto protective mother has to scare her underprepared daughter into self-sufficiency because she can't feed them both. As agitprop alone, Arctic Tale  must be doing something right: Coming out of the theater, my child threatened me with, "Shorter showers, Mom, OK?"
