Late in ''War of the Worlds," there's a shot of a battered highway sign reading ''Welcome to Boston" that made the preview audience with whom I saw the film burst into nervous laughter. Then the crowd fell silent -- more silent than I've experienced in a packed theater in many moons -- as the smoking ruins of our city came into focus.
''War of the Worlds," it turns out, is serious stuff, at times more so than it knows how to handle. Far from being a cowboy-up wham-a-rama like ''Independence Day," Steven Spielberg's updating of the 1898 H.G. Wells sci-fi classic tries to seriously envision what a cataclysmic alien assault upon Earth -- which in Hollywood terms always means America -- would look like. The Wells novel has already provided the material for a 1953 film and a 1938 Orson Welles radio show that scared the pants off the country. Spielberg wants to scare us, too, and to a more topical purpose.
This is, for better and for worse, his 9/11 movie, but while it's emphatically not for children, it ultimately treats a viewer like one. When the blue-collar hero played by Tom Cruise -- covered with the gray ash of his vaporized Bayonne, N.J., neighbors -- throws his kids in a car and hits the highway, his son screams, ''Is it terrorists?" ''This came from someplace else," he yells back, and you can almost feel the relief of the audience at being let off the hook of current events. It's just special effects, kid -- everything will turn out OK by the end credits.
Before we get there, however, ''War of the Worlds" envisions a believable and frightening hell on earth, with a startlingly un
heroic Cruise at the center of the action. The first hour alone stands as Spielberg's most confident filmmaking since ''Saving Private Ryan," a film that ''War" at times resembles (there's a little ''Jurassic Park" and ''Jaws" in there, too, not to mention all of ''Close Encounters" turned inside out).
Cruise plays Ray Ferrier, a dockworker who's two steps away from being a deadbeat dad, and it's a mark of the star's unfussy immersion in the role that I forgot all about his recent looney-tune shenanigans five minutes in. Ray's ex-wife (Miranda Otto, from ''The Lord of the Rings") drops their two kids off as the film starts and heads with her yuppie new husband to Boston for the weekend, but not before looking around Ray's bachelor pad -- car engine on the kitchen table, sour milk in the fridge -- with a sniff of distaste.
You can feel the bad history between them, and things aren't much better between Ray and teenage son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and 10-year-old daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning, who, when she's not screaming or in clinical shock, is her usual freaky little Bette Davis self). A backyard game of catch between father and son -- the latter wearing a Bosox cap just to tick off the old man -- is loaded with hostility, and Spielberg captures the unraveling family dynamic with a skill that recalls Richard Dreyfuss's domestic life going south in ''Close Encounters." Once again we're reminded that this is a director who knows from broken homes.
But there are strange lightning storms in Ukraine, and electro-magnetic pulse blackouts elsewhere around the world. And suddenly they're in Ray's backyard. The sequence in which the hero and his neighbors watch uncomprehendingly as a freakish hurricane eye approaches, lines of laundry whipping in the wind then ominously going limp, is gorgeously fraught with portent, and the following scenes, in which the community takes to the erupting streets and slowly begins to panic, is captured with clarity and an eye for the awful detail. On a personal note, as someone who happened to be living directly across New York Harbor when the planes hit and whose family and friends breathed the ashes for weeks afterward, let me tell you: This is how it felt.
Rather too conveniently, Ray and his children commandeer the one car not
 affected by the aliens' EMP burst, and head first to suburbia (where there's a terrifying sequence involving a downed plane), and then to Boston, where his ex-wife presumably waits. Their journey becomes increasingly apocalyptic as they join the throngs trying to cross the Hudson, and ''War of the Worlds" at this point plays like a blockbuster response to the little-seen 2003 Michael Haneke film ''Time of the Wolf," in which Isabelle Huppert and her family crisscrossed the French countryside in the wake of an unknown disaster. The comparison bears mentioning only because both Haneke and Spielberg want their pampered, middle-class audiences to consider what it's like to be refugees, and they want us to consider it hard.
But ''Time of the Wolf" didn't have aliens, and ''War" has them in spades: death-dealing battle machines that look like Stealth fighters atop snake-like tripods the height of skyscrapers. They come from underground, from underwater, from above, and they're ruthless. ''They've been planning this for years," says Harlan Ogilvy (Tim Robbins). ''This isn't a war. It's an extermination."
Harlan is a chatty, creepy survivalist whom Ray and Rachel meet while huddling in a basement, and it's with his appearance that ''War of the Worlds" begins to develop engine trouble. The three stay in that basement for a sustained, claustrophobic sequence -- it's probably 20 minutes, but it feels like a week -- in which they fight off alien probes and a recon mission by the critters themselves. Robbins plays his role with a minimum of subtlety (it's a Hollywood liberal's idea of a Middle American rube), there's a bit that echoes the velociraptors-in-the-kitchen scene from ''Jurassic Park" a little too closely, and the whole thing ends with a development that completely changes our opinion of Ray, and not necessarily for the better.
Curiously, in the next scene he emerges from that basement as Tom Cruise, action hero, and when the character disappears up the sphincter of an alien ship -- sorry, that's what it looks like -- I half expected him to come out holding Katie Holmes. The last third of ''War" alternates bloody horror show with increasingly dubious derring-do, and then, as with ''A.I.: Artificial Intelligence," Spielberg goes preposterously sentimental on us in the clinch.
When this happened, the preview audience hooted in derision and started filing for the exits, and who can blame them? We're older and wiser now; we've had our own close encounters, and not with E.T. If you're going to take us back to 9/11 -- and even amp it up to 11 -- you can't try to flatter us by pretending that everyone comes back alive. To do so condescends to audiences and trivializes the real event, and some of us may even find that offensive. ''War of the Worlds" pushes some of the right buttons and enough of the wrong ones to make you wish that Spielberg would move on from aliens already and use his unparalleled talents to focus once more on earth.


         As a boy growing up in the 1950s, Steven Spielberg was always watching the skies. He experienced meteor showers with his father, enjoyed space dramas like "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and dreamed, he told friends, of being the Cecil B. DeMille of science fiction.
 
  Now, half a century later, with awards and profits beyond counting behind him, Spielberg has kept faith with the boy he was. With "War of the Worlds" he has made what is arguably one of the best 1950s science fiction films ever, and that is not a backhanded compliment.
 


         






    Working in the spirit of his predecessors but with the kind of uncanny special effects they could barely dream of, Spielberg has come up with an impressive production that is disturbing in the way only provocative science fiction can be. It's a traditional, even old-fashioned effort that, like its 1950s forebears, is willing to confront up-to-the-minute societal concerns more mainstream features avoid. A film that, finally, may be even more disturbing than its creator intended or we've been expecting.
 
  While Spielberg has said in interviews that his focus in this film is depicting an ordinary guy and his children coping with an alien onslaught, in some ways the family dynamic is the weakest link in the story. Even with Tom Cruise as what the press material delicately calls a "less-than-perfect father," the remarkable Dakota Fanning as his wise-beyond-her-years daughter, Justin Chatwin as his inevitably surly teenage son and Miranda Otto as his remarried ex-wife, what we come away with is a sense of the power of evil, not the strength of good.
 
  This is due in large part to the potent nature of the underlying material adapted by screenwriters Josh Friedman and David Koepp: the celebrated H.G. Wells novel that has caused a sensation each of the previous three times it's been put before the public.
 
  When "The War of the Worlds" appeared in print in Britain in 1898, one of a series of groundbreaking science fiction novels including "The Time Machine" and "The Invisible Man" that Wells was turning out on a regular basis, its idea of aliens from Mars attempting a hostile takeover of the planet was startling in its newness.
 
  When Orson Welles did a radio dramatization of the story on the night before Halloween in 1938, a genuine panic shook the nation, with one individual, the New York Times reported, insisting to a phone caller "the world is coming to an end and I have a lot to do." And when George Pal produced a 1953 version of the tale, the film was striking enough to get a trio of Oscar nominations and win one for special effects.
 
  The irresistibility of the concept — at one time reportedly everyone from Alfred Hitchcock to Sergei Eisenstein considered doing adaptations — and the keenness of execution aside, the same two factors led to the success of each of those versions, factors that combine one more time to make Spielberg's rendering as potent as it is.
 
  All of these "Wars" have had the advantage of appearing at uncannily fraught moments in world history, striking a chord with a citizenry already primed to be unnerved. The original novel appeared when Britain feared an invasion from Germany, the Welles broadcast on the cusp of World War II, the Pal film during the Cold War. More than that, each version has had the additional plus of complete plausibility, of seeming like something that could be actually happening. Wells himself was keenly aware of his story's "attempt to keep everything within the bounds of possibility ... that from first to last there is nothing in it that is impossible."
 
  With the specter of terrorism, the threat of nuclear weapons in the hands of North Korea, Iran and who knows who else, not to mention the invasion of Iraq (which the film takes a veiled swipe at), we certainly live in perilous times. Spielberg's "War" is a perfect fit for our paranoid, potentially apocalyptic age, a film that considers the possibility, however obliquely, that the world as we know it could end.
 
  It's a tribute to the perspicacity of Wells that the voice-over Morgan Freeman reads to open the film comes almost word for word from the opening of the 1898 novel. "No one would have believed in the early years of the 21st century," Freeman reads with impeccable iciness, "that our world was being watched by intelligences greater than our own.... An intellect vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our planet with envious eyes."
 
  With this blood-chilling introduction out of the way, "War of the Worlds" (the film has lopped off the novel's initial "The" as well as all references to Mars) pulls back to introduce us to our protagonists: Cruise's parenting-challenged Ray Ferrier, Fanning as young Rachel, Chatwin as teen Robbie. A blue-collar kind of guy's guy who works on the Jersey docks, Newark resident Ray has to watch his kids for a few days while his ex (Otto) and her husband go off on a trip to which children are definitely not invited. It turns out to be one heck of a weekend.
 
  Working, as he has on many films, with Industrial Light & Magic's senior visual effects supervisor Dennis Muren, an eight-time Oscar winner, Spielberg makes impeccable use of special effects to make the pure fantasy of an alien invasion more believable than one would think possible.
 
  This starts with the mechanics of dread, the appearance of natural phenomena like lightning strikes in decidedly unnatural combinations. Then the terrifying alien war machines, the 200-foot-tall tripods, appear, looking so much like the book's vision they are almost identical to Edward Gorey's just-reprinted cover art for an edition of the novel he illustrated more than 40 years ago.
 
  Spielberg is at his best showing us the unimaginable damage these aliens do, from vaporizing people to destroying infrastructure. His effects are the opposite of showy — they aspire to be ordinary by taking place almost in the background, by being horrors we sometimes feel we are spying out of the corner of our eye. Collaborating with his veteran crew, including editor Michael Kahn, cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, composer John Williams and production designer Rick Carter, Spielberg (as he previously proved with "Saving Private Ryan") has a way of making these indescribable nightmares both realistic and compelling.
 
  How helpful the "War of the Worlds" protagonists are in this endeavor is more of an open question. Tom Cruise clearly knows how to hold the screen, and the film is better for that, but he's so unstoppably charismatic we never fear for him no matter what the aliens are doing, just as we never believe that deep down he's as bad a dad as the film wants us to think.
 
  His relationship with son Robbie is as much a trial to us as it is to the two of them, an exercise in hackneyed tedium that repeats the clichés of dysfunctional adolescence that have deadened more movies than anyone can count. It gets so bad there are moments when it seems the aliens staged the whole invasion just to give sullen Robbie a chance to prove himself to his obdurate dad.
 
  Dakota Fanning, who has held the screen with such heavyweights as Denzel Washington, Sean Penn and Robert De Niro, is a different story. Pound for pound, as they say in the boxing game, she is as good an actress as we have today. Fanning has a gift for naturalness and empathy that makes her the perfect audience surrogate. Her look of horror as she faces terror out the back window of a car is the film's emblematic image, the one shot that makes us feel the nightmare in our bones.
 
  When the aliens finally leave their tripods late in the film, they are sinister and repulsive, but they don't drop-dead terrify us the way the shark did in "Jaws." Spielberg is older now, less interested in juvenile jolts. Among the things that are the scariest in his current presentation are how thin the veneer of civilization is among human beings, how close to the surface panic and hysteria are in people like Tim Robbins' unnerved survivor Ogilvy. We are our own worst enemy as well as our only hope.
 
  Steven Spielberg may actually have done his job in "War of the Worlds" better than he realizes. By showing us how fragile our world is, how imperiled we might well be from without and within, he raises almost against his will a most provocative question: Is the ultimate fantasy an invasion from outer space, or is it the survival of the human race?   

At a traffic intersection in blue-collar New Jersey, the pavement buckles and shakes, a church front shimmies away from its walls, and a dark metallic body that looks like a giant robot squid bursts, as if born, from the earth, rising up over the block with its trio of deadly tentacles, its plated pterodactyl head, its glowing spotlight eyes. Is it our imagination, or did this extraterrestrial machine-creature let out a deep, rumbling roar? Watching Steven Spielberg's spooky and playfully spectacular remake of War of the Worlds , you may feel a surge of childlike awe, the same sort of awe inspired by the nuclear-nightmare fantasies of the '50s the moment when the giant tarantula, the Tokyo lizard king, the hell-bent flying saucer...the thing, whatever it was, stood revealed.
Yet Spielberg, an unparalleled master of the dynamics of movement and scale, scarcely gives the audience time to gape. Over and over in War of the Worlds , he evokes the sensation, more familiar from dreams than movies, that an otherworldly entity, glimpsed from a great distance, is suddenly, violently clawing its way into your personal space. The terror is far away and close up at the same time, which may be why the movie collides so forcefully with our anxieties.
War of the Worlds  is an attack-of-the-aliens disaster film crafted with sinister technological grandeur  a true popcorn apocalypse. As the army of invaders rises up, for no given reason, to exterminate the human race, the movie never takes itself too seriously. Spielberg, though, creates a potent and almost violating sense of disruption and terror. A death ray incinerates frightened citizens as they run right at us, and those tentacles swoop onto the ground, toying with humans like morsels of food. In one sustained virtuoso sequence, a tentacle winds and folds its way through a basement with snaky cunning, its ''head'' searching out people like a roving surveillance camera. (Is this a slyly embedded political statement?) Conjuring an army of metal monsters in the sky, then bringing them right into our faces, Spielberg plays off the post-9/11 image of a potential attack that is vast and relentless, epic in its horror, yet that deep in our imaginations looms frighteningly near.
Updating the paranoia of the 1953 screen version of H.G. Wells' sci-fi classic, Spielberg, working from a script by David Koepp and Josh Friedman, doesn't clutter the tension with solemn war-room scenes in which plaid-shirted civilian hackers square off against generals acting with their forehead muscles. He lets us take in the entire invasion through the scrambling, what's-happening-here desperation of Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), a jockish bum of a divorced dockworker who lives in a house he apparently never cleans. Ray is spending the weekend trying to look after his two estranged children, surly teenage Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and young Rachel (Dakota Fanning), both of whom resent their mess of a father, who seems to barely know them. The situation is stock, the casting shrewder than you might expect: Cruise, just at the moment his cocky narcissism has begun to look a little frayed off screen, is now credible enough to play a borderline deadbeat dad who loves his kids but copped out on the demands of parenthood.
As the three attempt to escape, zipping out of the New York area in what appears to be the only functional motor vehicle in the entire Northeast, Spielberg summons the stop-and-go rhythm of foreboding threat he used in Jaws  and Saving Private Ryan   the force of death that keeps returning, weaving in and out of the characters' fates like a dark spell, growing stronger with every appearance. We first experience  the aliens as scary, ear-cracking lightning bolts, which then animate those hovering monsters that zap people at random, the monsters being warships that house something else, which leave mysterious bloody vines in their wake. The very essence of the predators' danger seems to evolve the more that we learn about it, and the hysteria of the masses, vividly dramatized wherever Ray and his kids go, becomes part of the texture of cosmic alarm.
Make no mistake: What's unsettling about War of the Worlds , in its roller-coaster nightmare way, isn't so much the aliens' methods of destruction (I found the veiny vine stuff a little... unexplained) as it is the film's visceral vision of world annihilation as something uncanny yet imminent, happening right before your eyes  a fiery fulfillment of our collective nervousness about the fate of the future, an anxiety that may not have been this prevalent since the height of the Cold War. Spielberg has tapped it, once again making pop poetry out of our fears.

 Correction Appended  Quiet as the publicity department at Paramount has tried to keep it, the earth is under attack by aliens. I know what you're thinking: what, again? Once upon a time - for example, in 1938, when Orson Welles scared the bejesus out of America with his "War of the Worlds" radio broadcast - the pop-cultural spectacle of invasion from outer space could raise some real alarm. Of course, as a thousand think pieces over the next week or so are sure to remind us, Welles's Martians were symbolic displacements of actual threats, a role that marauding space creatures have often been happy to take on, especially during the cold war. But with "Mars Attacks!" and "Men in Black" - and even "Independence Day" - the aliens and their minions at the studios began to get a little self-conscious and somewhat less ambitious. The Martians were content to be temporary diversions from our true fears rather than allegorical crystallizations of them.  "War of the Worlds," Steven Spielberg's reasonably entertaining rendering of the 1898 H. G. Wells novel that also inspired the other Welles, makes a gesture toward reversing that trend. Mr. Spielberg's extraterrestrials, who rampage across New Jersey in metal death-ray-shooting tripods are - I'm looking for the precise critical term here - wicked scary. And the terror they spread as they incinerate buildings and vaporize people cannot help recalling more immediate and painful scenes.  "Is it the terrorists?" shrieks 10-year-old Rachel Ferrier (Dakota Fanning) to her stressed-out father, Ray (Tom Cruise), as they flee Bayonne in a stolen minivan. He is perhaps too preoccupied to give the honest answer, which is: "Well, sort of, sweetheart. In a metaphorical sense, that is." (Morgan Freeman's voice-over narration, taken pretty much verbatim from the Wells novel, helps to underscore this point.)  It is tempting, and not altogether out of place, to take "War of the Worlds" and last summer's Spielberg movie, "The Terminal," as the director's responses to the Sept. 11 attacks. "The Terminal" is a soothingly utopian post-9/11 movie, proposing decency, solidarity and good humor as antidotes to fear and anxiety, while "War of the Worlds" is nerve-rackingly apocalyptic, offering an occasional reprieve but not much solace. It is, in other words, a horror movie, and one that does not, for the most part, insist too heavily on its own topicality. As such, it takes Mr. Spielberg back to his early days as a maker of lean, sadistic, effective thrillers. Although the special effects are elaborate and expensive, "War of the Worlds" has some of the stripped-down ingenuity of "Jaws" and "Duel." Like those pictures, it is an elemental story of predator and prey. Unlike Mr. Spielberg's more recent films, in which he has used his unparalleled skill as a visual storyteller to create a complex tapestry of emotions, this one follows the thread of a single human reflex: fight or flight.  Mostly flight. Ray is a divorced longshoreman with weekend custody of his two children, Rachel and her uncommunicative teenage brother, Robbie (Justin Chatwin). Ray is not exactly a candidate for father of the year; he keeps a V-8 engine on his kitchen table and little besides half-empty condiment bottles in his refrigerator, and bonds with his son mainly by browbeating him. Once the aliens start vaporizing the neighborhood, Ray's reaction is less than exemplary, but he does manage to keep his family together and on the run, and thus buys a chance at the redemption you know is coming his way. Millions of deaths and incalculable property damage seem like pretty expensive family therapy, but it's heartening to know that even an alien invasion can provide an opportunity for learning and growth.  In any case, the psychological drama occupies as narrow a compartment in Josh Friedman and David Koepp's script as the current-events allegory. Mr. Cruise has lately proven himself to be much more interesting and unpredictable as a talk show guest than as an actor, but he remains adept at playing - either with or against type, depending on how you look at it - a jerk brought low by circumstances beyond his control.  Ms. Fanning, Hollywood's favorite endangered child, screams her head off, an appropriate enough response. The only other noteworthy piece of acting comes from Tim Robbins as a possibly deranged survivor hiding from the invaders in an abandoned barn. After a few minutes in his company, you can only wish that the Martians - or maybe the bloodthirsty puppets from "Team America" - would hurry up and do their job.  But acting is not really the point of this movie, which seems to arise above all from Mr. Spielberg's desire to reaffirm that he is, along with everything else, a master of pure action filmmaking. Think of "War of the Worlds" as a riposte to his competitors - Michael Bay, Wolfgang Petersen, Roland Emmerich and their profit-turning ilk - and as a primer on how to mix computer-generated imagery with the techniques of classic, large-scale cinema.  The visual atmosphere of "War of the Worlds" is the work of a team - including the cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, the costume designer Joanna Johnston, the editor Michael Kahn and the production designer Rick Carter - who all have worked with Mr. Spielberg many times, and their collective expertise gives the picture a crisp, seamless texture. Another longtime Spielberg collaborator is John Williams, whose score is striking partly as a result of how sparingly it is used. For long stretches of the movie, you hear no music at all, which deepens both the realism and the dread, and immerses you more fully in what you are seeing.  Which is, all in all, fairly spectacular. There are scenes and images in "War of the Worlds" that are especially stunning for seeming completely effortless. The first alien attack, in which a lightning storm from above is followed by the emergence of the tripod vessels from underground; a panicked crowd scene at a Hudson River ferry landing; a devastated suburban subdivision into which a plane has crashed - all of these are reminders of how sublime, how aesthetically complete, a few moments of film can be.  "War of the Worlds" is perhaps best appreciated as an anthology of such moments, bound together by a serviceable, if familiar, conceit. The film also allows Mr. Spielberg to indulge in the minor vice of self-quotation. An alien thoughtfully fingers a bicycle wheel, perhaps thinking of his benevolent kinsman E.T. The ear-splitting signal that the attack vessels emit sounds a bit like the first two notes of the "Close Encounters" siren song. An alien probe has the long, twisty neck of a "Jurassic Park" dinosaur and the eyeball of the surveillance spiders in "Minority Report." All of which serves as a reminder - perhaps superfluous - that this is only a movie, and a lesser Spielberg movie at that. But "War of the Worlds" also succeeds in reminding us that while Mr. Spielberg doesn't always make great movies, he seems almost constitutionally incapable of bad moviemaking. It's not much to think about, but it's certainly something to see.  "War of the Worlds" is rated PG-13. Much of the earth's population is wiped out, leaving very little time for sex or bad language.

A generation later, Steven Spielberg has made the anti-"Close Encounters" in "War of the Worlds," a gritty, intense and supremely accomplished sci-fier about some distinctly unbenign alien invaders. Latest adaptation of H.G. Wells' endlessly malleable and resonant 1898 novel preys upon the insecurities of a modern audience that's more fearful and skittish than was the case when the director made his optimistic early-career smashes about outer space visitors. Relentless mix of breath-sapping scares, awesome spectacle, Tom Cruise and a massive marketing push look to deliver the biggest B.O. haul Spielberg has enjoyed in quite a few years.
With each telling, this elemental story -- the first ever written about an alien assault on Earth -- offers a subtext appropriate to the paranoia of its era. Wells' original reflected attitudes about the British Empire as well as the rapid rise of science and technology; Orson Welles' panic-inducing 1938 radio broadcast (which had a New Jersey setting, as does Spielberg's film) arrived less than a year before World War II broke out; and the George Pal/Byron Haskin 1953 feature was very much a product of the anti-communist Cold War mentality.
Implicitly, then, this new take exists in the shadow of 9/11 and fears of new enemies bent on nothing less than the total destruction of the West in general and the United States in particular. Granted, "War of the Worlds" arrives after such pics as "Independence Day," "Armageddon" and many others have served up similar doomsday portraits in vivid detail, so such images are now commonplace in the collective pop culture mind. But Spielberg's vision of worldly wipeout has such visceral immediacy that it connects almost at once and rarely flags until the end.
For a $135 million special effects epic, it's striking how grungy and ordinary it looks. Foregoing the widescreen format, desaturating the colors and focusing on nondescript working-class neighborhoods, Spielberg and cinematographer Janusz Kaminski employ a raw, inelegant visual style to disguise the film's extraordinary stylistic sophistication and make seamless the interlacing of real and computerized action.
No sooner has dockworker Ray Ferrier (Cruise) taken weekend custody of his kids, disaffected teen son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and nervous daughter Rachel (Dakota Fanning), from newly married ex-wife Mary Ann (Miranda Otto) than dark clouds envelope the low-end waterfront area and thunderless lightning bolts hit the ground, knocking out electricity and motor vehicles.
In effects that look as realistic as the humdrum setting, streets crack open and collapse, buildings crumble and an enormous warrior robot rises from beneath the ground and starts firing away with an incinerating ray, vaporizing fleeing Earthlings and blowing up anything it wants. This is annihilation, without explanation.
In its frenzy of surprise firepower and sudden death, this initial action salvo packs a punch not unlike that of the opening of "Saving Private Ryan," albeit with a PG-13 gore factor. Spielberg is very good at filming frenzied flight -- his films are full of it -- and showing the characters subjected to the attack as fish in a barrel.
Somehow, Ray figures out how to get a car started, and manages to spirit his kids off to Mary Ann's house, where they pass a tense night. In the morning, they are greeted by the sight of a crashed passenger jet and members of a news crew, who inform them the 100-foot "tripods" are wreaking destruction everywhere. Despite this, Ray is determined to get the kids to Boston, where Mary Ann and her husband are visiting her parents.
From here on, Spielberg paints a portrait of devastated humanity that at times takes on medieval overtones in its evocation of widespread arbitrary suffering and every-man-for-himself opportunism while a pitiless force rains down pestilence on a suddenly pathetic-looking race. It's a canvas that has room for some striking, surreal brush strokes, such as Rachel witnessing dozens of bodies floating down a river, or a blazing night train roaring down the tracks.
Amid the mayhem, the volatile Ray can't keep his fractured family unified. Overcompensating for his failure as a husband and father by yelling a lot and trying to appear in charge when he's not, he drives his son away and maintains control of Rachel only due to her youth and his promise to get her back to her mom. He's supposed to be a regular Joe with plenty of foibles but good survival instincts. But he also seems to be on uppers, as Cruise is in overdrive virtually throughout. It's easy to see why Spielberg wanted the commercial cushion of an above-the-title superstar, but this is no more a performance-based picture than "Jurassic Park," and might have proven more balanced and artistically effective with a no-name cast.
Ironically, the suspense highlight is provided by the film's most intimate and quiet scene. Encountering a half-cracked man, Ogilvy (Tim Robbins), at a farmhouse, Ray and Rachel hide with him in the basement, which is soon penetrated by an enormous tentacle that slithers around every wall and post as the humans scurry to avoid detection. The framing, cutting and timing of this breathless sequence are unerring, revealing the master hands of Spielberg and editor Michael Kahn. Interlude precedes the long-delayed revelation of the aliens themselves, nasty looking buggers with dark crustacean-like heads and emaciated versions of a human torso (unlike all previous versions, this one does not identify them as Martians).
There is more terror in store, but when the end comes -- the solution is taken directly from the novel -- it arrives suddenly, with brief framing narration intoned by Morgan Freeman easing the viewer out of the nightmare. Quiet conclusion may leave some feeling a bit hollow at fadeout, but muted wrap-up is refreshing after all the overdone, slam-bang action climaxes of recent years.
Except for the anonymous soldiers obliged to do their duty, pic completely eschews the military and government types that are normally standard issue in this sort of fare, just as Spielberg and scenarists Josh Friedman (the upcoming "The Black Dahlia") and David Koepp ("Jurassic Park") avoid the cliche of showing landmarks being destroyed.
"War of the Worlds" alludes to many of Spielberg's previous works, and not just his sci-fi features. The contrast could not be more obvious between the gentle-spirited aliens of "Close Encounters" and "E.T." and the present film's murdering monsters. But there are unstressed echoes of many other pictures: the societal upheaval and personal displacement of "Empire of the Sun," the genocide of "Schindler's List," the sudden and arbitrary slaughter of "Saving Private Ryan," the mass hysteria of "Jaws," the fractious motorized family struggle of "The Sugarland Express."
Making the film look as grubby as it does was inspired, as it both enhances the action's believability and distinguishes the picture from the grandiose physicality of its big-budget brethren. Never before have such diverse and numerous visual effects appeared more naturalistic and undifferentiated from the actual, photographed material. Tech contributions are first-rate across the board, and John Williams' string-dominated score is unusually somber, even mournful.


This year's designated summer vacation Bigfoot, Steven Spielberg 's War of the Worlds  scans like a new-millennium-blockbuster mission statement: less froth, wonder, and safety, more ordeal, trauma, and internal bleeding. The carnival grounds have become a war zone. Indeed, with Batman Begins  and the latest installment of George Romero's  epic Deadness, it seems that Hollywood  has collectively decided that, this year, the June-to-August dog days will be a grave and mean season. More's the better, generally speakingand in the first, bolero-like movement of War , Spielberg spares no collateral and shoots the wounded. After we're set up with a rote, unconvincing Tom Cruise as-deadbeat-dad scenariohe's a Jersey dockworker saddled with his kids for the weekendthe sky begins to blacken, the odd light of close electrical storms takes hold, the wind kicks the laundry, and g slowly comes to town.
It's a rare thinga summer movie that demands to be taken as a serious emotional experience. If the urban-Americana vibe is hard for Spielberg to nail at first (harder than the California-suburbia rhythms that were his specialty two decades ago), the second-by-second unfolding of the tripodal alien invasion is one of the most eloquent pieces of under-the-skin filmmaking he's done in years. That is, it's a quaking nightmare, not merely because the ILM team got the physics rightwatch the Bayonne Bridge  twist and collapse in excruciating detailbut because the film focuses wholly on the obliteration of social control, individually and globally. In many ways, the movie reaches its peak with its chilling portraiture of mass panic, from the astonishing road hog exposition sequence (Cruise's terrified dad trying not to explain to his kids what's going on as he weaves in and out of stalled traffic and to and from the camera) to the image of a crowd tearing into an SUV's shattered windows with bloodied hands. Although it's thoroughly retooled, H.G. Wells 's scenario doesn't allow for many soft landings, and the extreme respect for havoc on view quite properly keeps the Spielbergian cutesies to a minimum.
That War  is the bare-fanged evil twin to Close Encounters of the Third Kind  is a given, but the movie's relationship to 9-11 is more troubling. Clearly, our experience in 2001, televisual and otherwise, has taught the F/X wonks a few things about massive catastrophe (a lot more smoke and dust, for one thing), but Spielberg explicitly alludes to the WTC attacks in dozens of ways: missing-persons postings, fallen airliners, reflexive questions like "Did you lose anybody?" etc. The references are merciless, and firsthand veterans of ground zero should approach the movie with tongs. Is it exploitation of our experience, or is Spielberg forming a statement? At the very least, the presumption, pace Roland Emmerich , seems to be that we have, after a four-year rest cure, regained our consumer's appetite for destruction. You may have.
War of the Worlds  is, in the end, more modest than its first half suggests; the screenplay has story-meeting paw prints all over it. (Justin Chatwin , as Cruise's surly teenage son, decides halfway through that "I have to see it!"what?and disappears for the rest of the running time.) Close to a half-hour is spent in a farmhouse basement with Tim Robbins  as a half-baked militia man. But there are moments of uncommon, distressing beauty: burning Jersey trees, a river of floating corpses, a crowd waiting at a railroad crossing as a burning runaway train barrels by, a snowstorm of tattered clothes excreted from human-consuming alien vessels. Other images, like a loaded Hudson River  ferry turning over matter-of-factly, dumping cars and people, can too easily steal your dreams.
And what of Tom? He's on the edge, in the movie and out of it, although Wells's simple story has been molded into a passional for Katie Holmes 's bubbly-headed Heathcliff to prove himself trustworthy and man enough. But there may be more to the psychodrama than even Oprah  anticipated: Wells's Martians-arriving-in-meteors paradigm is subtly altered, so that now the genocidal ETs are delivered by lightning bolts into the dormant ships buried underground for eonskind of like the time frame for Scientology 's alien occupation backstory. Could Tom be thinking he's finally produced a Dianetic cinema? Does it qualify as a faith-based initiative? As Wells said elsewhere, I look about me at my fellow man. And I go in fear.
