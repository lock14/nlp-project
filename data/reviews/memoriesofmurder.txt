American audiences are so used to watching the cat-and-mouse machinations of serial killers and their pursuers on the big screen that it comes as something of a shock to realize this 2003 Korean film is based on the true story of that country�s first-ever such manhunt in 1986. That it remains unsolved to this day only adds to the story�s queerly retro frisson. Memories of Murder
 takes place not in bustling Seoul but in the Korean countryside, where a group of local cops, led by Detective Park (Song Kang-ho), uncover the body of a woman in a rural drainage ditch. Raped, bound, and dressed in red, she�s just the first corpse in a mounting series of victims murdered by � who? Park, his partner Detective Jo (Kim Roe-ha), and their boss Cmdr. Shin (Song Jae-ho) are under pressure to find the identity of the killer but lack any real leads � the only clue, a footprint in the muddy road, is obliterated early on by an errant tractor � and so Detective Jo offhandedly decides to frame the village idiot (Park). It almost works, but incoming big-city Detective Yoon (Kim Sang-kyung) puts the kibosh on the frame-up and forces everyone to rack up overtime by insisting that the real killer is still on the loose. Sure enough, the next time it rains, there�s another dead woman in a red shirt lying dead in a muddy lot. Bong�s film is about as far afield from the clich�d American version of the serial-killer genre as you could possibly get, and it benefits from the sheer oddball lunacy of not only the killer but the cops themselves, who here are viewed as self-serving cretins barely smarter than the Keystone Cops, unable to even theorize about the identity of their quarry with any degree of imaginative precision, and all too eager to put the boot in when the first line of baited questioning fails to produce results. (Detective Park�s partner is notable for the amount of vicious glee he exudes while playing the role of Very Bad Cop; in the end, though, karma leaves him unable to do even that.) Despite the fact that these renegade cops seem way too unsupervised � not to mention untrained � to run a serious police operation of such magnitude, it eventually becomes clear that Bong isn�t trying to paint them as the bad guys at all, but as simple working-class stiffs running up against the limitations of their skills. Even after the arrival of the vastly more professional Detective Yoon, Park and Jo gamely keep up the struggle to unearth more clues (and to keep each new crime scene unspoiled). Their efforts, however, are thwarted at every turn, and so Memories of Murder
 becomes something of a rainswept Korean koan on both the nobility and futility of persistence in the face of obviously insurmountable odds.


The blackly eccentric humor of writer-director Bong Joon-ho's "Barking Dogs Never Bite" is anchored to a much more substantial framework in his sophomore feature, "Memories of Murder." Pic is a powerful, slow-burning portrait of human fallibility centered on a real-life series of unsolved murders in a country town. Part low-key character comedy, part atmospheric chiller, this much-awaited entry in the Korean spring release sked establishes Bong as a helmer with a distinct vision of his own, supported by a strong cast that's totally at one with the material. Interest from A fests should be certain, with some niche theatrical business also possible, given critical support.
The real-life events which the film uses as a springboard saw 10 women raped and murdered within a close radius in a small town in Gyeong-gi province, south of Seoul, during 1986-'91. The victims ranged from a 13-year-old school girl to a 71-year-old grandmother; the cause of death ranged from strangulation to stabbing; and one cadaver was bizarrely found to have nine pieces of peach stuffed inside her vagina. The unknown perpetrator was dubbed South Korea's first serial killer.
From its first shot -- repeated at the end, but with a different protagonist -- of a pair of uncomprehending peasant eyes against a flat, serene landscape, the film has an assurance and control that's streets ahead of Bong's "Barking Dogs" (2000). Image sums up the fractured innocence that greeted the murders, as well as the inefficiency with which the investigation was conducted, despite huge resources of manpower.
Though date captions are used early on, as the first victims are found, pic soon abandons any pretence at docu realism as the main characters emerge. Leading the investigation is local cop Park (Song Kang-ho), a bluff, rough-and-ready type who, following some gossip, tries to pin the murders on the town's half-wit, Baek (Park Noh-shik).
As a more experienced cop, Seo (Kim Sang-gyeong), arrives from Seoul, Park and his thuggish sidekick, Jo (Kim Roi-ha), are still trying to beat a confession out of Baek. When Seo proves that Baek couldn't possibly have done the murders, and leads the way to a third, as yet undiscovered corpse, resentment between the yokel cops and the big-city detective boil over in a drunken session one evening.
Though the main characters are pretty standard, and the tensions between them familiar from a host of crimers, the way in which they're played and directed is refreshingly different. Just as Park is much more than a boneheaded country cop, so the shaggy-haired Seo is hardly a slick yuppie type from Seoul. And though the local cops' methods of interrogation and investigation border on the criminally incompetent -- Park even consults a shaman at one point -- they're portrayed in a way that cleverly oscillates between the surreal and macabre.
Pic's tone slowly darkens halfway as the audience is shown a murder committed, and a female cop (Byeon Heui-bong) links the crimes to repeated requests for a song on a local radio station. Following a weird stakeout and chase on foot one night -- the movie's only "action" sequence -- the police separately trace the radio listener (Park Hae-il) and think they've got their man. But by now, the more methodical Seo has become as obsessed with nailing a perpetrator as Park was at the start.
International prints of the movie should be prefaced with a caption explaining the real-life background and that the crimes were never solved, as this knowledge -- which Korean auds will already be aware of -- directly explains helmer Bong's approach. With the ending always in clear view, Bong has focused on the investigators rather than the crimes, and on the effect of the crimes rather than their inherent thrills. The tension thus comes not from any traditional, last-reel solution but from the solution always being teasingly just out of reach. A neat coda, set in 2003, plays into this with a wallop.
As the earthy Park, who finally achieves a kind of self-knowledge, Song (the title character in "The Foul King" and North Korean sergeant in "JSA") establishes himself as one of the industry's premier screen presences, and plays well against Kim Sang-gyeong (the lead in "Turning Gate") as the quieter but more focused Seo. Smaller parts are exceptionally well cast and played, from Song Jae-ho's canny police chief, through Park Noh-shik's rolling-eyed dimwit, to Park Hae-il's creepy main suspect.
Taro Iwashita's gently susurrous score supplies atmosphere in tune with the flatlands setting, and Kim Sun-min's editing is trim across the two hour-plus span.

A police procedural like no other, Bong Joon-ho 's Memories of Murder  (2003) has the epic aura of a sociographic novel, but you won't see a less pretentious movie this year. Set in 1986 and loosely based on what's been called South Korea 's first serial-killer case, the film encourages ambivalences to grow like super-weeds, gumming up what is traditionally experienced as the most logical of narrative pleasures. An entire battered swath of recent Korean history sneaks into the movie's margins, underneath its deadpan surfaces, and amid the unsolvable mysteries of dark places, moonlit fields, and unseen events. It's an altogether remarkable piece of work, deepening the genre while whipping its skin off, satirizing an entire nation's nearsighted apathy as it wonders, almost aloud, about the nature of truth, evidence, and social belonging.
The big bites are discreetly taken, and little in Bong's previous film2000's Barking Dogs Never Bite , a droll rom-com-as-dog-eating satiresuggested the grace and originality at work in Memories . Our point man is Detective Park (Song Kang-ho ), a blustery, boorish jerk stationed in an unnamed semi-rural burg (the real murders took place in Gyeonggi Province ) whose battery of half-assed, TV-derived investigative ideas have gone as yet untried. The first bodya hog-tied girl, killed and dressed in a fetishistic manneris found under a covered gutter by a shimmering rye field, and immediately the crime scene is destroyed by passersby, children, and inept police work. Bong sustains this in a two-minute tour de force traveling shot, as Park bounces from one social intersection and forensic disaster to another and we get a 3-D sense of how difficult it is here to know anything for certain.
Bong never emphasizes the moral horror of the case, nor the psychological g-forces the cops might incurPark and his combustible partner Jo (Kim Roe-ha) regularly torture their suspects, and there's no glimpse inside their skulls. (Bong gazes at the abuse, particularly of a retarded man, so calmly and without inflection that the scenes slither over into black comedy.) Empathic bonding is an auxiliary concern, to say the least. The duo is eventually joined by Seo (Kim Sang-kyung ), a cliché of a laconic, handsome city cop who dismisses Park's caveman antics but who, it turns out, is also out of his element as more bodies appear, and the tantalizing clues pile up.
As with the history the movie dances with, irony is in no short supply. Memories of Murder  is about national, not personal, characterthe slogan-sustained, terror-generating Chun dictatorship is just another hidden-in-plain-sight vice compulsion, as much a murderous habit as virtually everything in Bong's film, from the cops' Gitmo -style transgressions and the killer's unseen spree to the binge drinking and a pitiable, caught-in-the-act masturbator's crime scene peccadilloes. The police chief disciplines Jo for drop-kicking a suspect in mid-interrogation by stomping him down the stairs; in the background, countrywide civil-defense orders and gas attack drills are ubiquitous. Park and Seo might make their way through a Molotov-ignited street protest, but they see nothing out of the ordi naryblind men in the fog.
That Memories of Murder  locates a potent sense of rue and melancholy among its sly metaphors and ravishing landscapes full of hiding places might be the best measure of its achievement. Like the year's other world-class Korean imports, Oldboy  and Save the Green Planet  , the film's storytelling strategy is unique and its point-of-view mutable and disarmingly subjective. The performances, particularly by Song, can be as broad as a freeway, but somehow Bong's judgment-free lyricism keeps it all in balanced context. In the end, the semi-true story's many unvoiced questionslurking in that dark roadside gully and elsewhereremain just out of reach. If you pick over the memory of the movie enough, everything is a mystery.
