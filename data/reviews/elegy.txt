When Ben Kingsley gets hold of a role he really connects with (I don't mean one of those shticky New Yawk scoundrels he loves to overplay in You Kill Me  or The Wackness ), he has no need to create fireworks; he lights up a character from within. In Elegy , which is adapted from Philip Roth's novella The Dying Animal , Kingsley portrays the sort of aging lothario who is usually reduced to a type  David Kepesh, a 60ish academic and critic who uses his minor-league celebrity to hustle graduate students into bed. Kingsley, with his forlorn eagle stare, makes a study of this man's seductive power (it's his way of saying less than he knows), and it's easy to see how Consuela (Penélope Cruz), a sophisticated beauty in one of his classes, gets drawn into his orbit.
We certainly know why he's drawn to her. Kingsley doesn't just voice Roth's rhapsodies of male ego and desire. He makes you hear what they truly are: desperate pleas for faith, a need to know if the lust that rules him is about giving or just taking. (It's the former, but he's too scared to see it.) There's a poetic irony to the idea that it took a female filmmaker to finally do justice to Philip Roth on screen. Director Isabel Coixet sees David's tragedy, but also his life force, and she draws brilliant work out of Cruz, as an unorthodox woman who knows what she wants; Patricia Clarkson, tender and worldly-wise as David's mistress; and Dennis Hopper, who makes you believe (I swear) that he's a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet.

 “Elegy” is such a serious, oftentimes grave exploration of desire and the ways of aging and desperate flesh that it’s a miracle the two central characters — a literary star named David Kepesh and his much younger lover, Consuela — have as much sex as they do. Despite some  low-key lovemaking and the considerably more overwrought talk, there’s very little pleasure to be found amid this film’s penumbral lighting, careful compositions and muffled, muffling good taste. There isn’t much juice here either, though the film is based on “The Dying Animal,” a brutal, short novel by Philip Roth that oozes like a wound.  The book is fascinating and repellent, more admirable than likable, a fusion of early Roth (sex) and late Roth (death). It’s narrated by Kepesh (Ben Kingsley in the film), who in 1972 metamorphosed into the title character of “The Breast” and five years later became Mr. Roth’s eponymous “Professor of Desire.” The Kepesh in “The Dying Animal” is 70 and engorged with rage. His fury and vigorous language belie the aging flesh he bitterly complains about as he recalls his obsessive affair with Consuela (Penélope Cruz, an obvious if remote object of desire) eight years earlier. She was his student and ripe for the plucking, especially in the film, where she enters clutching Roland Barthes’s “Pleasure of the Text” to her lush bosom.  In the novel Kepesh is pathetic and self-loathing, but perversely enthralling because Mr. Roth’s prose is. Kepesh detests his decaying (dying) body and worships Consuela’s ripe (blooming) one. In the film, directed by Isabel Coixet and written by Nicholas Meyer (he adapted Mr. Roth’s “Human Stain” to the screen), Kepesh is cool and watchful and Mr. Kingsley plays him without a trace of plausible weakness. With his flat stomach and beaky profile (he’s more eagle than goat), Mr. Kingsley looks too proud to indulge in the humiliating revelations that, in the novel, Kepesh ritualistically bathes in. The actor and the filmmakers have made the character their own, but their portrait of a lonely man incapable of surrendering to love is familiar and banal.  Comparisons between novels and screen adaptations are inevitable, particularly when a film announces its literary pedigree as this one reasonably does. The trick is not to confuse the two or assume that the best adaptation is the most faithful or makes for good cinema. “Elegy” has the veneer of fealty. It shares some of the book’s dialogue, most of its plot points and characters: a bold Patricia Clarkson plays Kepesh’s other lover, Peter Sarsgaard his unhappy son and Dennis Hopper his only friend. The film also dilutes  the novel’s pessimism, its smog of self-contempt and more aggressively ugly deeds and words — no one could mistake the onscreen Kepesh for a misogynist — but dilution,  bowdlerization, counter-readings and heresy are legitimate strategies in the adaptation racket. Dullness isn’t.  The problem with “Elegy” has nothing to do with faithfulness and everything to do with interpretation. The film is an overly polite take on a spiky, claustrophobic, insistently impolite novel, but this wouldn’t be such an issue if Ms. Coixet had the cinematic language that could withstand, equal, obliterate or transcend the book’s blunt force, its beautiful sentences, flashes of genius and spleen. Ms. Coixet has a fine eye and she has created a visual scheme — an attractively dark palette, discreetly hovering camera movements and smooth edits — that makes everything look very nice indeed (especially the radiant if miscast Ms. Cruz). There’s not a hair out of place here or an emotion. It’s as if Ms. Coixet had tried to quiet the howls of a dying animal.  It’s a wonder that filmmakers continue to adapt Mr. Roth’s work to the screen, which is largely inhospitable to tough, prickly and unappetizing ideas and characters, especially in America. It seems instructive that no great director has tackled this great writer, whether out of fear or shrewdness. Certainly it’s understandable that a female filmmaker would have a go at Mr. Roth, though “The Dying Animal,” with its unloving encounters, maddening woman troubles and occasional gynecological descriptions, really cries out for a reckless voluptuary like Catherine Breillat, who wouldn’t go all soft. She could smack all that male contempt around, but also give it its honest due. She would keep the novel’s furious bite.  “Elegy” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Female nudity.

The late, great works of novelist Philip Roth have been either ignored or poorly served by cinema, despite his tomes' rave reviews and bestseller-list success. "Elegy," based on his novella "The Dying Animal," about an affair between a professor (Ben Kingsley) and his student (Penelope Cruz), goes some way toward rectifying that neglect. Sparse, low-budget drama, helmed by Spaniard Isabel Coixet, intelligently translates Roth's meditation on lust and mortality without soft-pedaling its narrator's brutally honest, unabashedly sexist views. Pic should leave little room for mourning, B.O.-wise, if upscale auds show support.
First met touting his book on hedonism in America on "Charlie Rose," aging baby-boomer David Kepesh (Ben Kingsley) teaches practical literary criticism at an unnamed Gotham college. He makes a regular habit of sleeping with his students -- after they've got their grades, of course, so as to avoid sexual-harassment suits.
Instantly besotted by shy, Cuban-born beauty Consuela (Penelope Cruz), David initiates a passionate affair -- at least on his side -- visualized by some low-lit sex scenes. He keeps quiet about it, however, with his regular shag buddy and ex-student Carolyn (Patricia Clarkson), a high-powered businesswoman.
Adaptation by Nicholas Meyer (who also scripted the much less successful film version of Roth's "The Human Stain,") heightens the role of David's friend, poet George (Dennis Hopper), to give voice to the book's musings on sexual politics, delivered as a monologue in the novel. As David becomes increasingly "deformed," to use his own telling choice of word, by jealousy, suspecting Consuela will leave him for another man, George counsels him to chill out and accept the inevitable. "Stop worrying about growing old," he advises, "and think about growing up."
Unfortunately, despite his suave line of patter and clipped English sangfroid, David reverts to adolescent-worthy behavior, stalking Consuela on her nights away from him. At the same time, he refuses to offer her a future, even though that's clearly what she wants. An aesthete above all, David is unable to see beyond Consuela's perfect body and into her generous spirit.
A subplot (which Meyer's script ties more tightly to the main story than Roth's book did) limns David's fractious relationship with his doctor son, Kenny (Peter Sarsgaard). He's never forgiven David for leaving his mother when he was a kid, and is so determined not to repeat the pattern that he clings to his marriage even though he's fallen for another woman. George is also unfaithful to his wife, to Consuela's disgust.
Boys will be boys would seem to be the implication. Yet the script, femme helmer Coixet and star Cruz never let Consuela become a mere sex object. Even though David narrates and male voices generally dominate, Consuela's own unpredictable humanity pierces the illusions surrounding her. Pic's last-act reversal turns precisely on this thematic crux, making for an emotionally complex climax that, while it takes liberties, remains true to the spirit of Roth's unflinching endgame.
Coixet, who also takes a camera-operator credit under d.p. Jan Claude Larrieu, offers here a complementary companion piece to her breakout work "My Life Without Me," which also took imminent mortality as its key theme. Neither judgmental toward her characters nor too sentimental about them, she casts a cool gaze and tells the story cleanly, although she has more of a feel for the pain than for the fleshy pleasures of the story.
Perfs are beautifully in tune as scenes unfold in a series of near-musical dialogue duets, with Kingsley offering finely phrased arias of self-deprecation and despair. Despite the age difference, he and Cruz (who's never been better in English) look somehow chemically balanced and credible as a couple in a way Nicole Kidman and Anthony Hopkins never did in "The Human Stain."
Hopper takes a welcome break from the heavies and loonies of his late career to the sophisticate he's more like in real life, while the protean Sarsgaard is typically convincing as the uptight, conflicted Kenny. Clarkson similarly works wonders with her small but crucial role, and deserves bravery credit for disrobing in a movie that also features a naked Penelope Cruz.
Craft contributions are unfussily pro. Pic strikes a slightly duff note, however, with the musical choices (Coixet also takes a music-supervisor credit), recycling two of cinema's most instrumental pieces: "Gnossiennes No. 3" by Eric Satie, and "Spiegel im Spiegel" by Arvo Part. A worldwide moratorium should be imposed on their use by any film for the next 50 years.


It's May-December time again, and for an aging dude who scores one of the ripest young lovelies in cinema (Penélope Cruz ), Ben Kingsley  looks mighty down in the mouth. Or something—it's hard to tell because Kingsley is pulling one of his wooden-faced sphinx routines as David Kepesh , a skirt-chasing professor who gets his comeuppance from Cruz's Consuela, the luscious Cuban-American graduate student with whom he falls in love. Or something. Spanish director Isabel Coixet 's hushed and understated Elegy  is a flat, joyless affair, not just because of the total absence of carnal spark between Kingsley and Cruz—absurdly infantilized in bangs and a headband—but because it's adapted (faithfully, up to a crucial point, by Nicholas Meyer ) from The Dying Animal , one of Philip Roth 's least successful efforts to come to grips with male helplessness before what he calls "the tyranny of beauty." Funereally lit, the movie sags beneath fatally tasteful shots of Kingsley's profile in half-shadow, remorseful after his departed lover returns with a request he fears will unman him. Their dreary love story is enlivened only by excellent supporting performances from Peter Sarsgaard  as Kepesh's son, Dennis Hopper  as his best friend, and Patricia Clarkson  as his sometime sex partner. The softened ending is a travesty of Roth, even at his flawed second-best.
