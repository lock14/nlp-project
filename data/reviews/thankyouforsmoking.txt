         If you haven't heard of Nick Naylor and aren't quite sure who Aaron Eckhart is, "Thank You for Smoking" is going to change both situations once and for all.
 
  Though he's been excellent in "Erin Brockovich," "In the Company of Men" and numerous other films, Eckhart has never had a role that as enjoyably suits his particular gifts as Nick Naylor, a.k.a. "the Yuppie Mephistopheles," the outlandishly amoral public face of the tobacco industry who prides himself on being one of "the few people on this planet who know what it is to be truly despised."
 


         






    Naylor's outlandish exploits are the raison d'être for "Thank You for Smoking," a very smart and funny movie directed by Jason Reitman, who also shrewdly adapted the screenplay from Christopher Buckley's savagely satiric novel.
 
  So savage, in fact, that Mel Gibson's Icon Productions owned the book for almost a decade without figuring out a way to film it. Reitman, a successful creator of shorts and commercials, is the son of director Ivan Reitman, and his complete understanding of comedy has made "Thank You for Smoking" that rare film that actually has a sense of humor.
 
  Reitman's script and direction retain the novel's rhythms and black comic sensibility while at the same time eliminating and/or rearranging large chunks of its plot. He's also figured out a way to make the story more conventionally audience-friendly without losing the extraordinary bite that made the book so successful.
 
  That success is grounded in the film's fealty to the novel's raft of crazily comic but sadly believable characters, starting with the ultra-confident, gleefully glib, all but unfazable Mr. Naylor, the self-described Col. Sanders of nicotine.
 
  As a man who not only has to but actually enjoys defending the indefensible, Eckhart's Naylor is one of the great talkers of his generation, someone who truly believes that "if you argue correctly, you're never wrong." Remember, he asks, the boy who could pick up any girl? "I'm him on crack." Not just anyone could do his job, he tells his earnest 12-year-old son, Joey ("Birth's" somber Cameron Bright): "It requires a moral flexibility that goes beyond most people."
 
  Bringing Naylor to the screen is a tricky proposition. It requires an actor who can be convincingly amoral but also engaging and likable, someone whose actions horrify us but whose enthusiastic brio and ability to make the system do his bidding turn him into the hero almost against our will. It's a role that uses more facets of Eckhart than any has before, and he knows what to do with it.
 
  Making it easier for audiences to embrace Naylor are changes the film has made to his character. While son Joey, who lives with his divorced mother, is barely mentioned in the novel, his part has been greatly expanded in order to turn Nick into someone who really cares that the youngster know and understand him. Again, it's a tribute to Eckhart that he can do this within the context of a heel's persona.
 
  Though the Joey scenario adds more sentiment than laughs, those are generated by the other people Naylor deals with in his so-called life, starting with the always entertaining fellow members of the Mod Squad.
 
  These lunchtime companions, who enjoy referring to themselves as "merchants of death," include Polly Bailey (Maria Bello), an alcohol lobbyist and spokeswoman for the Moderation Council, and Bobby Jay Bliss (David Koechner), a gun lobbyist and spokesman for SAFETY (the Society for the Advancement of Firearms and the Effective Training of Youth.)
 
  The Mod Squad supports Naylor in his rivalry with anti-tobacco Sen. Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy) and tries to warn him against the wiles of top Washington reporter Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes), a woman who knows her way around a professional seduction. When she tells Naylor, "I'd love to see where the devil sleeps," she is not just being polite.
 
  These shenanigans aside, "Thank You for Smoking" is at its most amusing when Naylor's boss, the Captain (Robert Duvall with a really thick accent), sends him out to dependable Hollywood, always a ripe subject for satire but especially so in the knowing Reitman's hands.
 
  Naylor has two jobs in California. He has to offer a large sum of money to cowboy Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott), the erstwhile Tumbleweed Man whose "Lasso Some Flavor" ads made him the living icon of tobacco — until he went public with his inconvenient fight against lung cancer.
 
  Naylor's other job is more fun and only slightly less surreal. He gets to meet with super agent Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe), head of Entertainment Global, about a project that is close to Big Tobacco's heart: getting the movies to make cigarette smoking sexy again.
 
  With its architecturally significant building and in-house Zen garden, Entertainment Global and Megall are likely modeled after Creative Artists Agency and its then-maximum leader, Michael Ovitz. But as good as Lowe is as a man who sees himself as merely "a facilitator," the agency scenes are outright stolen by "The O.C." star Adam Brody as Megall's über-assistant, Jack Bein, an etched-in-cheerful-acid caricature that is killingly on the nose.
 
  One of the amusing conceits in "Thank You for Smoking" is that, except for clips such as John Wayne lighting up before taking a bullet in "The Sands of Iwo Jima," no one actually smokes in the film. It's an unexpected touch in an unexpectedly entertaining film.
 
 'Thank You for Smoking'
 
 MPAA rating:
 R for language and some sexual content   

Aaron Eckhart is a handsome devil who, since In the Company of Men , has made a tidy movie career for himself selling the Mephistophelian face of good looks: By virtue of square jaw and cold charm alone, he was born to play Nick Naylor, the infernally resourceful tobacco-industry lobbyist who peddles death for a living in Thank You for Smoking . And the way he promotes amorality as an attractive employment choice marks a new high in the actor's career playing ethically challenged men. I could swear Eckhart turns the glint in his eyes on and off at will, daring an audience not to love him while Naylor derides everything a health-conscious populace holds dear.  The guy earns his living campaigning on behalf of the fictional, richly named Academy of Tobacco Studies. He spins lies into truth and truth into lies. And once a week he gets together for booze, fatty foods, and shoptalk with fellow shills for alcohol (Maria Bello) and firearms (Anchorman 's David Koechner). They call themselves the M.O.D. Squad  as in Merchants of Death.
Thank You  is that kind of story, cynical and cheerily merciless. And damned if this biting comedy of hypocrisy, a confident feature-film debut for writer-director Jason Reitman, hasn't taken on even more resonance in the dozen years since Christopher Buckley first published the rollicking novel on which this tar-black PC satire is based. Today, spin is as persistent as cell phones that ring in a movie theater.
As a Vermont senator (with the unimprovable name of Ortolan Finistirre) and an antitobacco activist of the most fun-killing sort, William H. Macy, shoed in nubby socks and Birkenstock sandals like a vegan warrior, embodies every joke ever made about NPR. Hollywood pomposity is dispatched in the persons of a self-important studio honcho (Rob Lowe) and his groveling assistant, hilariously nailed by The O.C. 's Adam Brody. And as an alluring newspaper reporter with no qualms about employing seduction as a tool of the trade, Katie Holmes breezily sets back the twin causes of journalistic integrity and gender equality by decades. (If the movie turns out to be Holmes' last fling with professional freedom before committing to the role of Mother of Tom Cruise's Child, at least she goes out with a nice bit of dirty sex on her résumé.)
Still, the movie is also, for better and worse, as uniformly rolled as a machine-made Marlboro. (Apropos, Sam Elliott plays a former cig-promoting cowboy now angrily dying of lung cancer, bribed with a briefcase full of hush money.) And as a result of such smoothing out, where Buckley's book is scathing about spin, Reitman's movie is, well, kinder. Gentler. Perhaps because Jason Reitman is the son of producer-director Ivan (who, for Meatballs , Stripes , and Ghostbusters  alone, deserves a Canadian prix d'honneur). And something of Dad's eye for the box office has understandably rubbed off on the son, something that may well put the younger Reitman's Hollywood career on a fast track.
That same gentling, though, casts a disorienting glow, particularly when it comes to Naylor's empathetic, expanded screen relationship with his adoring 12-year-old son, Joey (Cameron Bright, coming up in X-Men 3 ). In the way of movies sure to be endorsed by someone like Finistirre, the bond between lobbyist father and impressionable son is now all too resistant to cynicism. Mocking PC piousness may have come of age in movie comedies, but family values are still no laughing matter.

 Glibly funny and eager to please, the film version of Christopher Buckley's novel "Thank You for Smoking" is not unlike the down-and-dirty habit of its title. Like cigarettes, this wisp of a film from the newcomer Jason Reitman  won't do much for your brain cells, but it may provide some transitory pleasure from its ostensible equal-opportunity political skewering. Certainly for admirers of its star, the consistently reliable Aaron Eckhart, who plays Nick Naylor, the fast-jiving, fast-running cigarette lobbyist who holds the story together even as he almost falls apart, there is something rather nice about lighting up together, as it were, even by proxy.  Set in the recent past, not long before Big Tobacco started cutting checks for its sick and dying former customers, the film tracks the ups and mostly downs of a Washington lobbyist who's consistently on the hunt for new and inventive ways to rebrand cancer sticks for public consumption. As a Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation memo explained decades ago,   "Doubt is our product, since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public." Wearing a million-dollar smile and tailored suit, Nick uses that doubt like a weapon, building on the work done by his employer, the Academy of Tobacco Studies, which Mr. Buckley based on the Tobacco Institute, the onetime trade association for the tobacco industry.  What makes Nick run? There's the money, of course, but mostly, as he confesses in voiceover, he's just good at it. Watching Mr. Eckhart, who appears in almost every scene in the film, such confidence is easy to believe. The actor moved into the small spotlight in 1997 as a seductive villain in Neil LaBute's scabrous "In the Company of Men." Since then, he has ranged across genres, roles and production levels, setting his square jaw to play equally well the nice and the reprobate. Although his blond good looks suggest that he could find steady employment as a B-list romantic lead, there is something overly hard about the cut of his jaw, something too intense in his gaze, which may explain why he routinely shows up as the heavy.  "Thank You for Smoking" isn't his best film (that would be "Erin Brockovich," in which he played a sensitive motorcycle dude), but this is the first role that has given him the room to play both ends of his usual character types, to turn his ingratiating smile into a leer, to charm even as he repels. Indeed, Mr. Reitman keeps the character moving at such a  clip that there isn't much time for contemplation, and just when you think you've put a finger on the character and his tar-black heart, Nick is already out the door. Whether he's hanging out with his fellow lobbyists, the other members of a self-anointed troika called the Mod Squad (Merchants of Death, natch), or chauffeuring around his son (played by Cameron Bright), Nick never sits still long enough to become a target.  The film is another matter. Mr. Reitman, who also wrote the screenplay, has a background in television advertising, and it shows. Although he steers his cast through its paces with facility, he tends to oversell jokes that were already plenty loud in the book. His visual gags, somewhat curiously, are generally weak, as if he had absorbed the wrong lessons from his time around the sets of his father's comedies. (As his studio-furnished biography announces rather too eagerly, his father is the director Ivan Reitman.) When Nick delivers a presentation about his job at his son's school, the kid's embarrassment ("please don't ruin my childhood") is funny enough even if the younger Mr. Reitman, who, to judge by the presence of two more fathers dressed as a pilot and a fireman, doesn't know it.  Save for Katie Holmes, straining credulity as a newspaper reporter who beds Nick for a story, the cast is exceptionally fine. To watch and listen as Maria Bello (as an alcohol lobbyist), David Koechner (defending our right to bear semiautomatics), J. K. Simmons (Nick's immediate boss), Robert Duvall (as a Big Tobacco legend) and an excellent Rob Lowe (as a Hollywood agent) put some topspin on their lines or execute a nice bit of business is to witness the satisfactions of a well-oiled movie machine. It's especially pleasant to watch the actors hustle and flow, since thinking too hard about "Thank You for Smoking" and the exact nature of its gored sacred cows can prove, if not dangerous to your health, more than a little irritating.  "Thank You for Smoking" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes mild violence, discreet sex and, of course, countless cigarettes.

Slick, stylish and sharp-witted, "Thank You for Smoking" is an entertaining satire on contemporary morality that skewers corporate spin culture, political correctness and that most rhetorical of concepts in Bush's America, personal freedom. Playing a Big Tobacco lobbyist, Aaron Eckhart puts his golden news-anchor good looks and smooth conviction to better use than in any pic since his breakthrough film, "In the Company of Men." While it won't catapult him into the $100 million club with dad Ivan, writer-director Jason Reitman's debut was an instant acquisitions target in Toronto that should appeal to hip urbanites, particularly guys.
Based on the novel by Christopher Buckley, the film might have been merely another derisively glib smack-down of a culture in which empty doublespeak reigns supreme. Instead, Reitman's script and his incisive cast -- with the exception of two obviously drawn characters -- lay sufficient analytical foundation to give ballast to the comedy's wry irreverence.
First seen on Joan Lunden's talkshow masterfully turning the tables on anti-smoking crusaders, Nick Naylor (Eckhart) is a gifted spin artist with no moral qualms about being the media spokesman for an industry that kills millions. He lunches regularly with the "M.O.D. Squad," short for "Merchants of Death" -- his counterparts in the alcohol and firearm industries, respectively: Polly (Maria Bello) and Bobby Jay (David Koechner).
Despite the consternation of ex-wife Jill (Kim Dickens), Nick exerts a powerful influence on his young son Joey (Cameron Bright), who absorbs dad's key lesson: "The beauty of an argument is that if you argue correctly, you're never wrong."
A chief anti-smoking combatant, liberal Vermont Sen. Ortolan Finistirre (William H. Macy), is lobbying to emblazon a skull-and-crossbones on every cigarette pack label. Nick is enlisted to combat the senator's plan by the Captain (Robert Duvall), who heads the Academy of Tobacco Studies.
Observing that movie stars once lent glamorous cachet to smoking but now only "psychopaths and Europeans" light up onscreen, Nick heads for Hollywood to schmooze Zen-spouting uber-agent Jeff Megall (Rob Lowe).
While Nick deals with death threats, a near-lethal kidnapping plot and the angry original Marlboro Man (Sam Elliott), now dying of cancer, the real stumbling block comes from a devastating profile in the Washington Probe by Heather Holloway (Katie Holmes).
Exuding cleverness, confidence and moral elasticity with a smug smile that never excludes likability, Eckhart is ideally cast. And if the movie's ending doesn't quite maintain the same level of coolly cynical insightfulness that comes before, nor does it sell Nick out and go for artificial redemption.
Making the most of the snappy dialogue are Bello and Koechner, whose scenes take mischievous digs at health nuts and sanctimonious liberals. Juicy contributions come also from Lowe; the suitably weather-beaten Elliott;; Adam Brody, hilarious as agent Jeff's rah-rah hustler assistant; J.K. Simmons as Nick's irascible, hard-ass Vietnam vet boss; and Duvall as a mint julep-sipping good ol' Southern boy. The darkly intense Bright also makes a strong impression.
Sole relatively weak notes come from Holmes, who lacks even a hint of the wiliness of a ruthless reporter; and from the reliable Macy, who is cramped here by obvious writing in his easy-target liberal character.
Showing a confidence at the helm that befits a guy who grew up on movie sets, Reitman assembles a tight tech package, including sleek widescreen lensing by James Whitaker, clean editing by Dana A. Glauberman and a score by composer Rolfe Kent that alternates between loose jazzy riffs and more whimsical notes. Also well deployed are some vintage smokin' songs, including numbers by Tex Williams, the Mills Brothers and the Kingston Trio.

"You want an easy job, go join the Red Cross ," someone says deep into Thank You for Smoking , a gleeful topical farce about capitalist mendacity based on Christopher Buckley 's bestseller. The implication, made drummingly plain in every bon mot, is that our ethical barometers skew lazily toward goodness, and that the toughest tasks, appropriate only for the meat eaters among us, are those that require bulletheaded amorality. It's an under-flogged axiom of American businessif only Jason Reitman 's movie had more muscle in its whip arm.
What seems worthy of modern satire is often a hair's breadth from pillorying itself, and the gray zone between unamusingly tedious and roaringly redundant seems to be shrinking with every new reality show, post-postmod marketing-media experiment, and governmental depravity. Thanks to the institutionalization of irony, it's difficult to bitch out the bad guys persuasively, but it presents a Miltonic dilemma: How do scumbags look in the mirror, and explain themselves to their children? As it is, Buckley tried and failed to plumb the rational depths of a tobacco lobbyist's moral vacuum, and so does the movieit remains an appalling mystery.
Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart ) is the go-getter in question, an ex-jock-style salesman who puts a public face on the cigarette industry: smug, effective, mercenary, and unscrupulous, hitting talk shows with a straight face and pressing Hollywood  flesh in an effort to make smoking in movies cool again. Narrating in amused confessional mode, Naylor  is a pure-blooded dog-eating-dog until his son (Cameron Bright ) presents him with a ready-made conflict: try to rationalize your actions (tobacco fatality rates are quoted repeatedly) but still be a good dad.
In Hollywood (Reitman is Ivan's son), the dilemma only has one schmaltzy answer, and the film tries to not cop out on its way to a fizzle. But Smoking  is all funaholic appetizer anyway, buttressing Eckhart's boy-faced sell-monster with competitive lobbyist buddies (boozer Maria Bello , gun-excuser David Koechner ), a splenetic boss (J.K. Simmons , of course), and a humorless crusading senator (William H. Macy ). Buckley is best at sharp-tongued one-liners, which constitute a lion's portion of the script, and for that it's difficult to be ungrateful. While subplots working in Katie Holmes 's dewy-eyed reporter and Robert Duvall 's aged billionaire fall limp, an extra laurel should be laid upon the crown of TV vet Adam Brody , whose bouncy salvo as mega-agent Rob Lowe 's sycophantic assistant crams more Industry mockery into two minutes of screen time than State and Main  managed at all.
But instead of hitting the gas and allowing the scenario to rock 'n' roll with g-forces (outside of an activist kidnapping and assault with nicotine patches), Reitman keeps his movie small, unvaried, slack, and deliberately and oddly, completely smoke-free. Not a single butt is lit, even though Eckhart's semi-hero is forced to quit halfway through, with no discernible impact on his disposition or the story. Was Reitman nervously pandering to the smokeless choir, or did he decide that actual smoking, in a movie wholly taken up with how to whitewash death, disease, and culpability, was beside the point? Did Buckley's hero help write the screenplay, and did Raleigh -Winston money change hands? Think of it as Dr. Strangelove  without bombs, or Super Size Me  without burgers. How deep can a satiric bite be when the object of outrage has been wrung out of the mix, just as a lobbyist would've wished?
