         Mockumentaries have become the scourge of low-budget cinema; given a camera and actors who can talk, filmmakers with amusing concepts seem to think they're the next Christopher Guest. The only two really necessary ingredients, of course, are rare: Actors gifted at improvisation and a director who knows when to move scenes along. Happily, the British import "Confetti" has both.
 
  Confetti, a bridal magazine, is holding a contest for the year's most original wedding. Aided by two expert planners, the three finalist couples struggle with logistics, family and their own foibles — no surprises here. But this sometimes cumbersome framework showcases supremely committed performances that manage to sell theme nuptials based on tennis, Hollywood musicals and naturist (apparently not the same thing as "nudist" but to most eyes they'll look the same) culture. As one of the planners gushes, "It's a three-ring circus of love!"
 


         






    Theater veteran Debbie Isitt directs on the shoulders of Guest (there are clear "Best In Show" and "Waiting for Guffman" influences) but does so deftly. Scenes seem just long enough, and although the pathos can feel forced, she mostly succeeds in building empathy for a ragged bunch of folks with unusual dreams.
 
  Fans of the original "Office" will be delighted to see Martin Freeman back in nice-guy mode as half of the musical couple. Comic Jimmy Carr is hilarious as the magazine's publisher: "I'm a bride's best friend," he announces brightly, then adds, resignedly, "I'm not gay."
 
  Speaking of which, easily the most likable partners are the wedding planners (Vincent Franklin and Jason Watkins). Bravely dedicated to their high-strung, complicated charges, they are the heroes of the piece — and its paragon of the enduring, loving couple.
 
  "Confetti" also makes terrible singing funny again, with the musical bride (Jessica Stevenson) admitting she is "physically dyslexic" and "slightly tone deaf." And the groom's best man, Snoopy (the scene-stealing Marc Wootton), is an awful rock frontman who warbles before the happy couple at a pub gig, "You made your bed / I hope you lie in it with the girl who stole our dreams away / She's just like Yoko Ono / Dead man walking / Can't you hear your old friend talking?"
 
  Under the insanity and unsexy nudity, "Confetti" has a sweet center. Comic timing, themes of tolerance and commitment and the marriage of farce and empathy lift the film above the mockumentary pack.
 
 MPAA rating: R for nudity and language. A Fox Searchlight Pictures release. Conceived, directed by Debbie Isitt. Producers Ian Flooks, Ian Benson. Director of photography Dewald Aukema. Editor Nicky Ager. Running time: 1 hour, 34 minutes. In selected theaters.   

In Confetti , three (fake) engaged couples compete to stage the Most Original Wedding in Britain, with a dream house dangled as a prize by editors of the (fake) bridal magazine that lends this frothy improvised British comedy its apt, tossed-in-the-air name. And the (real) Stateside gurus who dream up stuff like My Super Sweet 16 are probably kicking themselves that they didn't copyright the concept first. Must viewing for the Bridezillas set, this winning pageant of gaudy bad taste is the work of some of the U.K.'s most popular comedy performers (among them Martin Freeman from BBC's The Office  and Jessica Stevenson from Shaun of the Dead ), gaily throwing themselves into the earnest implementation of three howler wedding themes: tennis, nudist, and Hollywood musical.
Directed script-free by theater pro Debbie Isitt, the movie emits the piquant odeur  of Waiting for Guffman : Freeman and Stevenson play a drab duo who love musicals but can't carry a tune, and all three couples are assisted by a pair of wedding planners (and life partners) who make Guffman 's Corky St. Clair seem butch. Yanks should be proud, I suppose, that American excess and vulgarity provide fodder for a charming Busby Berkeley finale. Equal opportunists, though, might wish Isitt had set at least one of the three nuptials amid some truly wretched Brit pomp for a change.

 Anyone who has cringed while watching the home movies of newlyweds bumbling through their own corny, personalized nuptials will appreciate the comic potential of the British mock documentary “Confetti.” The title is also the name of the movie’s fictional bridal magazine, whose editors dream up a contest in which three pairs of panting exhibitionists, aided by wedding planners, compete to win an award for most original wedding concept. The winning couple will be featured on the magazine’s cover and given an ugly, expensive new house in which to try living happily ever after.  Conceived and directed by Debbie Isitt and improvised by a moderately clever cast of British television regulars, “Confetti” is obviously inspired by Christopher Guest’s “Best in Show,” in which Mr. Guest and his brilliant repertory company turned a dog show into an incisive satirical microcosm of everything wonderful and weird about American pet owners.  But as you watch this pallid British imitation, which has two or three laugh-out-loud moments at best, you long for the American crew’s X-ray vision. “Confetti” lacks Mr. Guest and his company’s shared understanding that each person is a miniature comic planet with its own quirky climate, whirling in its own eccentric orbit.  Content to go only a third of the way to the bottom of its characters, the movie gives each a few comic tics and leaves it at that. The first couple we meet, Matt (Martin Freeman) and Sam (Jessica Stevenson), are tone-deaf sweethearts fixated on the idea of singing their I do’s in a ceremony staged as a Busby Berkeley-style Hollywood musical.  Josef (Stephen Mangan), a fading tennis pro, and his Canadian fiancée, Isabelle (Meredith MacNeill), contrive a tennis-theme wedding with dancing ball boys and a referee for a preacher. Grimly competitive, with a streak of paranoia, Josef is prepared to cry foul if another couple wins.  The final pair, Michael (Robert Webb) and Joanna (Olivia Colman), are dedicated nudists first glimpsed riding bicycles in the buff with other tubs of unclothed flesh. The selection of their “naturist” wedding for the contest doesn’t make sense in view of the magazine’s refusal to put nudity on its cover.  The most fully realized (and Guest-like) inventions are the overtaxed wedding planners, Archie (Vincent Franklin) and Gregory (Jason Watkins), a pair of dowdy, hyperemotional gay fussbudgets who like to dress identically and who take their work with utmost gravity. In the frantic days before the contest each has a meltdown.  The movie throws in subsidiary comic characters, but most contribute little in the way of fun. One happy exception is Matt’s best man, Snoopy (Marc Wootton), a hostile rock ’n’ roller whose notion of an original wedding anthem is a nasty, profane putdown of a girlfriend. (He eventually settles on a rock version of “Cheek to Cheek.”)  The biggest letdown is the contest itself: a tacky three-ring circus that is not nearly exaggerated (or inept) enough to explode into comic madness and is undermined by a lurking sentimentality. Matt and Sam are somehow able to chirp their vows in tune. Josef and Isabelle’s balletic tennis match has an oddly surreal grace. Michael and Joanna’s silly fig-leaf ceremony, at the end of which the leaves are shed, has no maniacal spark. “Confetti” ultimately lacks nerve and imagination.  “Confetti” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has several scenes of nudity.

"Three Weddings and No Funeral" just as easily describes "Confetti," an agreeable Britcom about three couples competing in a magazine-sponsored contest for the Most Original Wedding of the Year. Devised (via improvisation) by sophomore helmer Debbie Isitt ("Nasty Neighbours"), pic is reminiscent less of Richard Curtis' romcoms and more of Christopher Guest's mockumentaries, with a dash of early Mike Leigh. However, it's not as outright funny as any movies of the above helmers at their best. Pic earned $1.2 million in its opening weekend, good for second at the U.K. box office behind "Mission: Impossible III."
Slick, mass-market matrimonial mag Confetti chooses three couples as finalists in its Most Original Wedding competition.
Suburban sweethearts Matt (Martin Freeman, from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy") and Sam (Jessica Stevenson, from cult sitcom "Spaced") want to have all-singing, all-dancing nuptials.
Highly competitive yuppies Josef and his Canadian fiancee Isabelle (Stephen Mangan, Meredith MacNeill, both from "Festival") choose a tennis theme.
Finally, nudists Michael (standup comedian Robert Webb) and Joanna (Olivia Colman) have their hearts set on a clothes-free ceremony -- a decision the mag's double-barreled bitch of an editor, Vivien Kay-Wylie (Felicity Montagu), is determined to tone down. "Naturist doesn't mean naked," she insists.
To help each couple get ready -- and keep them on message with Confetti's image -- the mag hires camp-as-Christmas wedding planners Archie Heron and Gregory Hough (Vincent Franklin, Jason Watkins). Their sweet, loving relationship will endear pic to metro-sexual viewers.
As the big day approaches, all start to crack under the strain. Matt -- who's a variant on the "decent bloke" type Freeman played in U.K. sitcom "The Office" -- rebels against the meddling of his future mother-in-law (onetime Mike Leigh regular Alison Steadman) and sister-in-law (Sarah Hadland). Meanwhile, Sam contends with the open antipathy of Matt's best man, Snoopy (Mark Wootton).
It's in this strand's straight, joke-free scenes that "Confetti" finds its surest footing, providing emotionally believable ballast against the somewhat contrived set-up and borderline caricatures elsewhere.
Per pic's press notes, filmers shot three different endings, only in postproduction choosing the couple which wins. However, some viewers may feel the "A Mighty Wind"-style matrimonial climax entirely lacks surprises.
Cast reps fine individual talents with crack timing and, in the case of Freeman and Stevenson particularly, enough dramatic chops to put over the serious stuff. But compared with the tightly-knit ensemble in Guest's pic, individual members of the "Confetti" team seem to have slightly differing comic agendas. As a result, the decision of Isitt, who comes from a legit background, to let the thesps drive the script creates a somewhat ragged result.
Nimble cutting by editor Nicky Ager helps to smooth things down, but there's too much reliance on a stream of pop hits to add punch to the movie's lulls, including that old standby, John Paul Young's "Love Is in the Air." HD lensing by Dewald Aukema is efficient.

Despite its title, Confetti , a chaotic mockumentary in the finest tradition of English vulgarity, has nothing whatever to say about marriage. It's a loud belch in the face of a billion-dollar wedding industry that has sprung up to service the longings of the post-feminist young for ceremonial opulence. Broad as a beam and blithely treading on every politically correct toe in sight, Confetti  is too tied to situation comedy to function as satire. Which works to its advantage, for the movie manages to slag off beautifully on the honchos of reality television without patronizing either the form or the fame-and-fortune-hungry multitudes who queue up for their 15 minutes.
The movie's fertile subject is themed marriage ceremonies, and the conceit is a contest, carelessly hatched over a liquid lunch by the publishers of a glossy wedding magazine, between three engaged couples to come up with the best gimmick for their nuptial hours, with the winner scoring a million-dollar mansion in which to embark on their connubial bliss. A couple of giddy wedding planners (played in a key of buoyant poofterism by Vincent Franklin  and Jason Watkins ) will help them realize their dreams of getting spliced, respectively, while playing tennis, while stark naked, and while dancing a Busby Berkeley  spectacular. That all three couples are utterly useless in their chosen fields of performance goes without saying. But as preparations for the competition videos get under way, the couples' lack of talent or finesse pales before the aggravations of meddlesome friends and family, prominent among them a terrific Alison Steadman , former wife and collaborator of Mike Leigh , as an interfering mum with a basilisk stare guaranteed to freeze the balls off the hapless planners.
Indeed, Confetti , cobbled together by a pack of ad-libbing British comedians, plays like an anarchic parody of Mike Leigh's increasingly ossified and earnest method of workshopping and improvisation. In lesser hands, this could rapidly decline into summer-camp burlesqueas it's sort of meant tobut director Debbie Isitt , whose outlook on life will be immediately apparent from the name of her company, Wasted Talent Productions , handily exploits the radical promise of live reality programming to subvert the aims of its managers by running exuberantly out of control. The rollicking and ineffably sweet final wedding sequences offer a rambunctious poke in the eye of television's mania for tight control, its congenital antipathy to dead space or spontaneity. Isitt herself seems to have almost limitless tolerance for the unscriptedher large professional ensemble is sprinkled with real-life figures, including a Spanish tennis coach named "Hey-Soos," who was brought in to coach the actors and stayed to mediate their characters' endless bickering.
As always the ever-so-humble come out tops, yet Confetti  comes not to emulate, but to rescue us from the seemingly endless stream of cookie-cutter British comediesthe lazy-minded spawn of The Full Monty about workers moving on up through soccer, song and dance, or flashing their tits for a good cause. And if nothing else, this affectionately off-the-wall confection offers exuberant confirmation of every suspicion you might ever have had that the English are charmingly eccentric. They're barking mad.
