There's a lot of sex in "Feast of Love": in beds, against sliding glass doors, under the stars on the 50-yard-line of a football stadium. The bodies are athletic, young, and white, and yet this is not the sport sex we usually see in Hollywood movies. It's the sex of adulation. Sometimes the director Robert Benton goes heavy on the hydraulic positioning, but his movie is scarcely mechanical.
"Feast of Love" is his easiest movie to like since 1994's "Nobody's Fool," and it's immediately homey. Watching the film's carousel of romantics float around the lush Portland, Ore., setting (a completely different universe from Gus Van Sant's marvelously unwashed locales), you might want to pack your bags and start looking for a place there to live.
Whatever you do, be wary of the real estate services of Diana (Radha Mitchell). She might find you an incredible house. But she might also break your heart, the way she does to Bradley (Greg Kinnear), the sunny, needy, mildly narcissistic coffee shop owner she seduces while helping him find a new nest after his wife (Selma Blair) leaves him for a woman.
Diana winds up dating Bradley but really she happens to be in love with a married man, David (Billy Burke), whose dark nature is the opposite of Bradley's. What they have qualifies as a little crazy (they like pushing each other's buttons) and Diana herself is a piece of work. She blows into the movie during the one spell of bad weather in a gorgeous trench coat and gradually evolves into Kathleen Turner in "Body Heat." But the movie's tone is capacious enough to harmonize her infelicities with the idealistic passion of Oscar (Toby Hemingway) and Chloe (Alexa Davalos), the young couple who fall for each other the minute she walks into Bradley's coffee shop, where Oscar works; and with the seasoned, formidable love between Harry and Esther, who are played by Morgan Freeman and Jane Alexander.
"Feast of Love" has been keenly adapted by Allison Burnett from Charles Baxter's novel. He's rejiggered the "Rashomon"-like structure into something that worked on the page but might have seemed contrived on screen, and Benton keeps it oscillating elegantly.
The director turns 75 tomorrow. He's been making movies about human decency and the essential need for people to get along for almost four decades ("Kramer vs. Kramer," "Places in the Heart") at a patient rate of about three every 10 years. And nothing in this new movie should work. It's about people walking into rooms and falling instantly in love with each other; it's full of pronouncements, platitudes, and coincidences. Harry, who, for the movie's purposes, is Bradley's best friend, hangs out in his cafe a lot, dispensing solicited advice, and happens to live next door to Bradley's new place. You don't say!
And yet because "Feast of Love" is ardently acted (even by someone as emotionally monochromatic as Burke) and so unself-consciously made, it seems like a work of nature. The predicted events and predictable sentimental touches (the word "foyer" tacked to a wall is meant to make you well up and it does) have an organic emotional potency.
Even Morgan Freeman's wisest-man-in-the-history-of-wisdom routine feels exactly perfect for this movie. There's a moment when he breaks down in tears that makes you want to break down in tears; and another, when he tells Kinnear (who's very good, too) to shut up, that might be one of the most unexpectedly funny things Freeman's ever done. For once, he's not playing God or being cool. He's not being asked just to be Morgan Freeman. You'll probably never again want to see him be unaccountably holy, gratuitously presidential, or simply nonhuman again. It just seems a waste, since he's one of the best human beings the movies have.
In "Feast of Love," Benton treats Freeman like another besotted soul in this deceptively controlled lovers' universe. If the cosmos is pulling Harry and everyone he knows together, the miracle of the movie is that we never see the strings.

         Love is a many-splendored thing in Robert Benton's dull romantic fantasy "Feast of Love," though none of its splendors ring
s
 true.
 That's because in the Arcadian, storybook Portland, Ore.,
 in which the movie is
 set, love is a simple binary system -- it's either on or off, pure or compromised, hot or age-appropriately snuggly. (The last one depends on whether the female half of the couple in question -- or both halves, if they're cute young lesbians -- is young and pretty enough to merit some full frontal nudity and scenes of vigorous sack action.) What it's not 

is complicated, or nuanced, or interesting.
 
 Based on the novel by Charles Baxter, the movie is ostensibly an exploration of love in its many forms, but mostly it sticks to the credulity-and-patience-straining kind. Morgan Freeman, cast again as a paragon of perfection (just once, it would be great to see him play a spiteful neurotic or a selfish bastard), plays Harry Stevenson, a happily married university professor who, when not at home regaling his loving wife, Esther (Jane Alexander), with stories about youngsters falling in love before his very eyes, hangs out in a local cafe dispensing gems.
 


         






   The main recipients of his insight are Bradley (Greg Kinnear), the cafe's hangdog owner, and Chloe (Alexa Davalos), a gorgeous orphan who floats into Jitters (Bradley's establishment) seeking employment and falls into the arms of its barista Oscar (Toby Hemingway).
 
 Chloe's mysterious provenance and cryptic conversational style suggest trouble, but the movie soon belies this notion. That's because in the world of "Feast of Love," impoverished 20-year-olds from terrible backgrounds meet cute, mate for life and click neatly into a tight-knit, loving community that's saving a special spot just for them, and trauma gets no traction.
 
 When we meet Bradley, he is living in clueless bliss with his younger wife, Kathryn (Selma Blair), who clearly despises him. Bradley is impervious, however, even after Kathryn and a member of a rival softball team (Stana Katic) exchange meaningful under-the-table caresses within moments of meeting each other. Next thing you know Jenny is picking up Kathryn in her jeep and announcing, "We're going to have such adventures, you and me, Kathryn and Jenny, Jenny and Kathryn," and Bradley is dumped. No sooner has he recovered from the blow than he falls in love at first sight with Diana (Radha Mitchell), a  real estate agent with a married lover.
 
 If this sounds promising, it's not. Kinnear has perfected the role of the deluded sad-sack, but the difference here is that the movie unabashedly admires him for these qualities, shares his delusions and holds him up as a romantic ideal. He bounces back from each betrayal with an equanimity of the last relationship ("Maybe Kathryn was meant to be with women!") and dives right in again, headfirst.
 
 We're meant to find this special, but it comes across as dumb and desperate. He and Harry may spend all day exchanging platitudes over cappuccinos, but Bradley learns nothing about himself. Similarly, Harry is mourning a death and blaming himself, but you'd never know it aside from the scene when he mourns the death and blames himself. For a movie about love and loss, "Feast of Love" is amazingly free of catharsis, which has the unfortunate effect of making it neither funny nor sad.
 
 The script, adapted by Allison Burnett, weaves three interlocking stories in unlikely ways and relies on random acts of violence, fate and God for dramatic complications that the characters aren't fleshed-out enough to whip up on their own. This impulse reaches its absurdist apex in the character of Bat (Fred Ward), Toby's drunken, psychotic, knife-wielding father, as well as in the tragic predictions of a $20 psychic.
 
 Benton co-wrote "Bonnie and Clyde" and directed "Kramer vs. Kramer," which seemed so perfectly tuned to its era as to define it, but his eye for detail fails him here, and "Feast of Love" suffers from the worst kind of nonspecificity. Underneath the characters' surface diversity, t
hey are flat and one-note
. Nor does the story -- which loosely references Shakespeare's "A Mids
ummer Night's Dream"
 -- play as comedy, tragedy or farce. Instead, it plays like an uneasy mix of the three, a parade of archetypes grimly embodying their main characteristics against a bogus setting.
 

 
 "Feast of Love." MPAA Rating: R, for strong sexual content, nudity and language. Running Time: 1 hour, 42 minutes. In general release.   

Feast of Love , Robert Benton's bobos-in-love ensemble drama, adapted from the Charles Baxter college-town novel, is far too cloyingly pleased with its own humanity. Greg Kinnear, as a Portland coffee-bar owner who loses his wife (Selma Blair) to another woman, is the divorcé as sad-eyed puppy, and Morgan Freeman, as a professor recovering from the death of his son, lays on the life-affirming pensées. Radha Mitchell, playing a real estate agent trapped in a sordid affair, has vibrance, but the film wastes no time reducing her to another soddenly ''innocent'' romantic.

 Playing a canny old papa bear dispensing nuggets of advice to a flock of unruly cubs in “Feast of Love,” Morgan Freeman, Hollywood’s sage for all seasons, has a role he could act in his sleep. Early in this serious comedy, directed by Robert Benton and adapted by Allison Burnett from Charles Baxter’s popular 2000 novel, “The Feast of Love,” Mr. Freeman’s character, Harry Stevenson, observes that when the Greek gods were bored, they invented humans. Still bored, they invented love, which wasn’t boring, so they tried it too. Then they invented laughter so they could stand it.  Harry is a semi-retired philosophy professor living in Portland, Ore., with his stately wife, Esther (Jane Alexander). The recent death of their only son, Aaron, from a heroin overdose has shaken but not shattered them. They carry on like benign surrogate parents, or therapists, solemnly monitoring the behavior of the film’s mixed-up younger folks.  Remarks about Greek gods and the foibles of humanity may have their place over brandy and cigars. But despite the kindly gravity Mr. Freeman puts into them, they sound portentous and condescending in the context of “Feast of Love,” a hollow  contrivance masquerading as a wise and witty contemporary gloss on “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.” This is a movie in which the characters’ beliefs in haunted houses and fortunetelling are taken half-seriously. Mr. Benton, now in the twilight of a distinguished career (“Kramer vs. Kramer,” “Places in the Heart”), should have known better.  Mr. Burnett’s clumsy screen adaptation of the novel has merged the author’s voice with Harry’s and relocated the story to Portland from Ann Arbor, Mich.  The city shown in the movie looks as leafy and placid as the Springfield of “Father Knows Best.” This quasi-suburban Everycity is apparently insulated from the global terrors of today. There are few signs of the urban rat race, and real estate is affordable. It could almost be 1975.  Harry’s superior insight is first glimpsed in Jitters, a Starbucks-like coffee shop owned by his friend Bradley  (Greg Kinnear), who boasts of his perfect marriage  to Kathryn (Selma Blair). The three of them are having coffee when Jenny (Stana Katic), seen in a women’s baseball game moments earlier, plunks down beside Kathryn and puts the moves on her under her husband’s nose.  Bradley is oblivious, but Harry notices.  When Kathryn storms out of the house to live with Jenny not long afterward (and disappears from the movie), Harry gently tells Bradley that the evidence was right in front of his eyes, if he had bothered to look.  Mr. Kinnear, like Mr. Freeman, is recycling a stereotype he has played before: a bland, wagging puppy who is smugly clueless and (despite one sweaty lovemaking scene) sexless. Bradley’s tinny shtick becomes the movie’s theme: Is love just nature’s plot to give us lots of babies, or is it the only thing that gives our crazy lives any meaning? It could be a Barry Manilow song.  Even after Bradley’s eyes have been opened, he goes on to repeat a variation of the same mistake. He meets and marries Diana (Radha Mitchell), a beautiful real estate agent who has been carrying on an affair with a married man (Billy Burke) that is too hot to give up. When these dogs in heat get riled up, they slap each other in the face. Bradley would sooner die than slap anyone in the face.  The marital woes of this cardboard man and his search for the perfect mate are the rickety spine around which the movie spins its undercooked dramas. (Another thing undermining “Feast of Love” is the proliferation of multicharacter stories on television that allow room for character development.) The least satisfying story line involves Oscar (Toby Hemingway), an ex-jock and recovering heroin addict in his late teens who works in Jitters, and Chloe (Alexa Davalos), a new girl in town with whom he falls in love the moment she enters the shop. Oscar lives with his abusive father (Fred Ward), a mean, knife-wielding drunk. To stay out of his reach, the cash-starved lovers resort to making a pornographic video, of which a tidbit is shown.  A more accurate name for “Feast of Love” might be “Feast of Breasts.” At every opportunity, Mr. Benton, a director who has always relished showing the female form, turns the camera on his actresses’ gleaming torsos. These beautifully lighted soft-core teases lend an erotic frisson to a movie that in most other ways feels enervated.  “Feast of Love”  is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nudity, sexual situations and some strong language.

Living up to its grandiose title, "Feast of Love" is a cinematic essay on the infinite varieties of amour -- from the reckless ardor of youth to the cooler, more compromised emotional landscape of marriage. Septuagenarian director Robert Benton brings his characteristically fine touch with actors and appreciation for the female form to this tastefully erotic ensembler, but compassion finally outstrips insight in a drama as soft-headed as it is soft-hearted. A strong cast topped by Morgan Freeman probably won't keep "Love" from remaining mostly unrequited in theaters, though it may attract older audiences on homevid.
In his 2001 novel, a sort of modern-day gloss on "A Midsummer Night's Dream," Charles Baxter positioned himself within the narrative framework as a collector of love stories from people young and old. In addition to shifting the action from Michigan to Oregon, scribe Allison Burnett has handed Baxter's omniscient point of view to Freeman's character, who becomes the film's glue as well as its requisite aging voice of wisdom.
University professor Harry Stevenson (Freeman), is a regular at a coffee shop run by his good-natured friend, Bradley Smith (Greg Kinnear). Only Harry notices when Bradley's wife Kathryn (a flinty Selma Blair), sullen and unhappy despite Bradley's perpetually upbeat view of their life together, shows signs of attraction to another woman, Jenny (Stana Katic).
A thoughtless act on Bradley's part crystallizes the reality that he's more in love with the idea of love than with Kathryn, and sends the latter into Jenny's arms for good. Thus Blair, easily the film's thorniest, most fascinating presence, storms out of the picture much too early, though not before the camera has lingered on her and Katic in a sweaty post-coital haze.
Desperately eager for love, Bradley soon sets his sights on blonde goddess Diana (Radha Mitchell), a realtor who coaxes him into buying a house they eventually share. Diana, however, also remains embroiled in an affair with a handsome but cynical married man, David (Billy Burke).
Script devotes much time to the sweet romance of two teen baristas
 at Bradley's coffee shop, Chloe (Alexa Davalos) and Oscar (Toby Hemingway). Representing love in its steadfast, mature stages are Harry and his wife Esther (Jane Alexander).
Given the potentially unwieldy nature of the enterprise, Benton juggles the multiple narratives with considerable grace, and succeeds in creating a warm (if somewhat improbable) sense of community among the principal characters. The director remains one of an aging Hollywood breed of old-fashioned classicists, who continue to place faith in carefully sculpted, dialogue-driven scenes, filmed with a largely static camera (a sudden handheld jolt during an emotionally heightened scene is immediately noticeable).
In the film's poetic, bittersweet musings (delivered in Freeman's ever-authoritative voiceover), one can hear Benton repeatedly clearing his throat to make a grand, definitive statement about love and its ability to make tragicomic fools of us all.
But for better and often for worse, "Feast of Love" is unmistakably the work of an older filmmaker, and too often its philosophizing has a musty, let-me-tell-you-how-it-is tone that would be easier to take if Benton and scripter Burnett offered a tougher, more realistic view of their characters.
Pic initially mocks Bradley's eager romanticism (played with endearing shagginess by Kinnear) but ends up indulging it, while Diana and David are arguably let off the hook too easily for their mutual infidelity -- a perception borne out by Mitchell and Burke, neither of whom seem interested in making their characters particularly sympathetic.
And Chloe's visit with a psychic initiates some creaky tragic foreshadowing that only viewers inclined toward fuzzy-headed mysticism will be able to swallow.
That leaves the copious nudity as the film's most interesting talking point, with Mitchell and Davalos receiving generous photographic attention; from "Kramer vs. Kramer" to his previous film, "The Human Stain," filming attractive ladies in the buff has become something of a hallmark of Benton's work. Given the context, at least it can't be called gratuitous.
The soundtrack shoulders much of the dramatic weight: Jeff Buckley's cover of Leonard Cohen's "Hallelujah" provides lovely background in a tenderly played scene between Davalos and Hemingway, but the Frames' "Falling Slowly," heard to such glorious effect in this year's "Once," falls flat in a poorly edited lovemaking montage.
Shot in Portland, Ore., the pic takes excellent advantage of the natural beauty of the Pacific Northwest.

Director Robert Benton , best known for his zeitgeisty divorce drama Kramer vs. Kramer , has tapped into more than a few current trends in Feast of Love . There are the interlocking mini-stories, à la Crash ; the different color filters for different scenes (happy moments in yellow, sad ones in blue), à la Traffic . And now that dessert bars are all the rage, he's decided to serve up a film feast consisting only of sweets: a smorgasbord of cream puffs and treacle tarts, all topped with a bracing smear of marshmallow fluff.
Based on a 2000 novel by thenUniversity of Michigan  prof Charles Baxter , the film transposes the setting from an idealized Ann Arbor  to an idealized Port landa glowing little town where all the women are strong, the men good-looking, and the children above average. More to the point, in Feast 's Portland, men from all walks of life play touch football on the grassy lawns of Portland State University, while philosophy professors mingle with coeds in a coffee shop called Jitters. The café in question is run by Bradley (Greg Kinnear ), an eager, doggy fellow who has no luck with the ladies. After his first wife leaves him for another woman (Selma Blair  and Stana Katic , respectively, who pop in for an obligatory lesbian sex scene before disappearing from the movie entirely), Bradley immediately gets hitched again to Diana (Radha Mitchell ), a real-estate agent who doesn't believe in true love.
In a movie entitled Feast of Love , this has to be the first sign of trouble, and indeed, the course of married life does not run smooth for these two. Meanwhile, Bradley's two troubled young baristas, Oscar (Toby Hemingway ) and Chloe (Alexa Davalos ), are falling in mad, mad love over the cappuccinos that they decorate with foam hearts every morning. Their feelings for each other never wanetheir certainty is at once adorable and boringbut they have other troubles to deal with, including semi-poverty (in one confusing subplot, they are so strapped for cash that they make a sex tape) and the ominous presence of Oscar's father (Fred Ward ), a leering caricature of a knife-wielding drunk. But two couples do not make a 2007 intersecting-storyline movie, so, yes, there's yet another relationship stuffed in here: Morgan Freeman  and Jane Alexander  are an aging professor and his supportive wife, who share a secret sorrow. Believe it or not, they're in love too: old-people love, which means that they hug a lot and drink wine together in their creaky-floored, tastefully decorated Victorian home.
At first, Feast  seems to lay out an interesting project for itselfto catalog the look and feel of relationships at different stages in our lives. But for a film that purports to be an epic consideration of Love in Our Time, Feast  is strikingly unthoughtful and uninterested in any but the most obvious kind of romantic love. In this rosy, cosy world, either you're in love or you're not; either you fall for someone in the blink of an eye, or you never do. Bradley, Diana, Oscar, and Chloe move in and out of infatuation with the fierce capriciousness of Shakespearean lovers.
Indeed, although the plot has nothing in common with A Midsummer Night's Dream , the mood of the film constantly evokes it, from the dew-drenched magic of moonlit Portland (several characters are insomniacs) to Morgan Freeman's world-weary narration ("Lord, what fools these mortals be!" we keep expecting him to up and declaim). Freeman is as compelling as always, playing a wry, wise observer (as always), but not even his voice at its gravest and most gravelly can save dialogue like "Sometimes you don't know you've crossed a line until you're already on the other side."
Kinnear struggles with the genial, "I'm a small-town coffee-shop owner" blandness of his character. "Do you think love is a trick, or do you think it's the only meaning there is to this crazy dream?" Bradley asks several women. This lame dichotomy is meant to be a litmus testhis true soul mate is supposed to pick the latter, of course, and by the end of the movie we are, too. Instead, the question becomes a metaphor for the one-note sugar high of the film itself, where any greater meaning is obscured by a sticky-sweet approach to love, with a cherry on top.
