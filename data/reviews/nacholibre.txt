Infinitely more entertaining than anything the WWE has done recently, this sophomore outing from Napoleon Dynamite
 director Hess is full of cheesy goodness, but it's Velveeta, compadre, and it slides around and around and finally right through you like a greased luchador
 grappling within a sweat-slicked squared-circle of muy machismo
 gone goofy. As a comedy, it's hit and miss; it works better and feels more fully developed when Hess has the corpulent Black tug on your heartstrings. And he does, too: Nacho Libre
's greatest asset isn't the occasional burst of outr� yuks from Black, who's been honing his very specific comic niche since he and Kyle Gass first popped up as the faux-rocker duo Tenacious D back in 1999, but the thoroughly unironic dollops of good, old-fashioned heart and soul. Plotwise, this is straight out of the Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland "Let's Put on a Show and Save the Orphanage" playbook. Black plays Nacho, a young orphan obsessed with the exploits of those omnipresent masked Mexican wrestlers � such as El Santo � who grows up to become a man with similarly muscular desires. As the culinarily challenged cook of his backwater Oaxacan monastery, he prepares the monks' daily dose of gruel with a stoic (if paunchy) mien, until fate intervenes not once but twice. It's the arrival of the saintly nun, Sister Encarnaci�n (Reguera, whose resemblence to both an antique china doll and Pen�lope Cruz is bewitchingly bizarre), that first sparks a desire to buck the status quo in this man who would be King of the Ring. Lit from above like some Renaissance angel as envisioned by Guillermo del Toro, her heavenly radiance empowers Nacho to create his own thrift-store version of a wrestling outfit and take to the ring in hopes of funding a better breakfast for the brethren. Pummeled into submission, he's not a very good fighter, but after a chance meeting with the feral, vocally secular Los Olvidadan
 Esqueleto (the skeletal Jim�nez, who is simply the best thing this film has going for it), the two join forces to � more or less � save the day. Hess uses his Mexican locations to great effect and the teaming of Black and Jim�nez is inspired, but rarely does Nacho Libre
 have you rolling in the aisles � it's content to keep you chuckling along and basking in Black's ability to so skillfully manipulate his eyebrows you might think he'd been temporarily possessed by the shade of John Belushi (or, possibly, Sam Donaldson). As in Napoleon Dynamite
, there are catchphrases galore, but precious few that stick with you past the theatre parking lot. It's a strange hybrid, Nacho Libre
, part genuine homage to the culturally unique world of Mexican wrestling and part barrage of feel-good, cornball antics. It never quite jells into what you might have hoped for (i.e., a "laff-riot"), but in another light becomes something wholly unexpected: the most soulful and silly Mexican wrestling melodrama of the year.


A couple of years ago, I finished a review of ``Napoleon Dynamite" with the words ``What remains to be seen is whether director Jared Hess has another movie in him -- a real movie, about real people."
With ``Nacho Libre," the jury's still out.
Some fussbudgets might want to get their dander up about this film, since star Jack Black is essentially doing a brownface routine as a low-level Mexican monk who dreams of being a masked wrestler. (He's not literally wearing makeup, thankfully, but the performance is still pitched at the level of Bill Dana's old Jose Jiminez character on '60s TV.)
``Nacho Libre" just isn't worth the bother, though. Very broad and very
 silly, it's a doodle of a comedy -- a one-joke idea (fat guy goes luchador) padded out to feature length by Black's willingness to do anything for a laugh.
He plays Ignacio, a woebegone friar at a rural orphanage who cooks daily doses of black-bean glop for the kids. (One asks, ``Couldn't we have a nice salad someday?") Moved by the appearance of a new nun, the lovely Sister Incarnacion (Ana de la Reguera -- Hess films her entrance as if it were the appearance of a saint in a 1950s religious film), Ignacio dons cape and mask and appears in the local arena as Nacho Libre, a wrestler of singular incompetence.
That's really all there is to the plot, and when the narrative stalls -- which it does, often -- Black strikes an idiot pose or flexes his tushie or (in the film's one moment of truly inspired lunacy) warbles a love song for Incarnacion that could be an outtake from one of Black's old Tenacious D records. Say what you will, the man knows he's a human punch line and acts accordingly.
So, yes, there are some decent, if callow, giggles to be had, as well as a genial sense of the bizarre that takes the sting out of the proceedings. When Nacho has to fight two midgets in lion costumes -- they resemble deranged Ewoks -- you marvel both at the absurdity of the scene and the film's deadpan refusal to take it any further. The image is
 the joke, so why bother with comic invention?
Since Hess uses the same uninflected tone that made ``Napoleon Dynamite" a hit in middle schools across the country, though, Black's exertions unfold in a void. At times, it's like watching a stand-up comic at a wake.
The director sure loves his freaks, though. He films the lumpy, cross-eyed Oaxacan peasants head on, like found objects at a roadside tourist stand, and he revels in the scrawny physique and jelly-lipped grin of Nacho's tag-team partner, Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez, who gets off a few good lines about his faith in science over religion).
``Nacho Libre" also spends a good deal of time with one of the orphans, a pint-size human bowling ball named Chancho (Darius Rose), and a wrestling promoter's obese daughter (Carla Jimenez), who has a crush on Esqueleto and literally tunnels through walls to get at him.
Racism, general misanthropy, or fond celebration of life's misfits? Discuss. It should be pointed out that the characters here are no less geeky or gawked at than anyone in ``Napoleon Dynamite," but also that ``Napoleon" took place in Idaho, the Utah-based director's backyard, and that goofing on nerds of other countries is dangerous business. In the end, ``Nacho Libre" isn't exempt because it's a comedy but because it's piffle. Dig up a ``Love and Rockets" comics compilation -- one featuring Gilbert Hernandez's Palomar stories -- if you want small-town Mexicans who are foolish, noble, absurd, and human.
Here, you have to settle for Jack Black pursing his lips and shaking his man-boobs , for tatty wrestling smackdowns and cow pies in the face. What remains to be seen is whether Jared Hess has a movie in him aimed at anyone over 13 years old.


         Hurtling across the screen in sky-blue stretchy pants worn under apple-red underwear, Jack Black makes a lasting impression. He's bouncy. He's kinetic. He flies into solid objects with great force. Days after seeing him in "Nacho Libre," Jared Hess' sweet, dumb-funny follow-up to "Napoleon Dynamite" (which he also co-wrote with his wife, Jerusha Hess), I kept picturing Black as a giant Super Ball. I loved Super Balls as a kid, and regarded them as the amazing apotheosis of a major scientific advancement of some kind, just as the box copy told me to. Anyway, simpler times.
 
  "Nacho Libre" is set in those times — specifically, the '70s — in a monastery in the countryside outside Oaxaca, Mexico. Black plays Brother Ignacio, a reluctant friar who works as a cook at the orphanage where he was raised but dreams of the fame and glory of the padded lucha libre 
ring. From the moment he experiences his first, small success, however, you know he's really in it for the kids. Pursuing his passion in secret, with the help of a fey man-urchin named Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez), he pours his earnings into improving the lives of the orphans by increasing their daily roughage intake, and dreams of buying them a bus for field trips. He also entertains romantic notions of marrying the beautiful nun Sister Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera), who has come to the orphanage to teach. That is, if he can talk her into not being a nun anymore.
 


         






    Although, by comparison, "Nacho Libre" is a silly piece of kitsch, it put me in mind of the old Cantinflas movies, and not just because Ignacio's rival sports Cantinflas' trademark quote-mark mustache. Cantinflas was the well-known persona of Mexican actor and comedian Mario Moreno, whose characters were all variations on a penniless outsider who uses his gifts for obfuscation and confusion to get out of scrapes or get ahead. Ignacio is no wily Cantinflas, and "Nacho Libre" contains nothing like the barbed satire of Moreno's films, which merrily skewered Mexican society.
 
  But there's a quality to Black's character that recalls a certain kind of underdog common to Latin American and Italian comedies of the '50s and '60s: the little man who is beloved precisely because he is ridiculous, pathetic and innocent, not in spite of it. His humanity gives him dignity, and his warmth and generosity earn him love. Underdog stories are relatively common in American films too, but their characters' happiness usually depends on an ultimate triumph, usually reached in a narcissistic, obsessive-compulsive, zero-sum quest for success. What's rare to see, and what ultimately makes "Nacho Libre" so enjoyable, is the story of an underdog who's allowed to remain a humble clown all the way to becoming a hero.
 
  Black is a gifted physical comedian with surprisingly expressive eyes and an even more surprising tender streak, and Hess makes ample use of it in the training and fighting scenes, as well as those with the kids and Sister Encarnación. In one scene, he invites her to his room for an evening snack of toast, whereupon they discuss their favorite color. As Esqueleto, Ignacio's geeky sidekick, Jiménez is feral and cuddly in the most lunatic way imaginable, and Ana de la Reguera is charming as the nun who comes to appreciate the big-hearted, barrel-chested fighter.
 
  Hess and his production designer Gideon Ponte also endow the movie with a visual flair that's rare in studio comedies — everything about the look of the movie is appealing — and he makes wonderful use of a score by Danny Elfman, old Mexican pop songs and music by Beck. The movie is closely attuned to detail, making excellent use of the locations and incorporating all sorts of local features. (A local treat — corn on the cob on a stick, slathered in mayonnaise and chile powder — is put to lethal use in one especially gruesome scene.)
 
  Much of "Nacho Libre" takes place in the ring, where Ignacio (going by Nacho) and Esqueleto duke it out with a bevy of bizarrely attired wrestlers whose signature moves include things like slamming their opponents with folding chairs, and, say whatever you will about them, Black and Jiménez can take a beating. But the charm of "Nacho Libre" is mostly to be found in the two friends' ruminations on faith (Esqueleto believes in science), love, dreams and nutrition. If ever a movie paid homage to fresh fruits and vegetables, it's this one. And if ever a born loser looked like the winner of the future, it's Nacho.

It's happened to all of us. You get revved to see a big Hollywood comedy, starring an actor so funny he could make you laugh in your sleep, and you're disappointed. Majorly. You can see what the film was going for, but the jokes just sit there; you chuckle a few times, mostly out of lame hope, but you never bust a gut, never really get what you came for. It's the movie-comedy equivalent of a middling date. Then, a few months later, or maybe even a few years, you run across the same movie on late-night cable, and to your surprise and slow-dawning delight you find yourself watching. Compulsively. The lead character may still not be that uproarious, only now, with your expectations dialed down to zero, you can't help but notice that there's a certain ineffably amusing...essence about him. Scenes that once fell flat now exert their own fruitcake logic; they may be dumb, but their dumbness now comes off as  exquisitely conscious. You're hooked. You can watch that same movie again and again, and you do.
In recent years, I've had this experience with The Cable Guy , Tommy Boy , and Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy   all of which I had panned, without much mercy, in this magazine. (Sorry, Jim, David, Chris, and Will.) So maybe at some point in the future, I'll be lucky enough to have it with Nacho Libre , a kitschy faux-Mexican idiot-slob wrestling comedy starring Jack Black and his noble, blubbery bod. It's a movie that seems to be trying hard for that cheesy-innocent, so-stupid-it's-smart vibe, and it represents the collaboration of some very gifted people: Jared Hess, director of the flip yet indelible youthquake Napoleon Dynamite , and the brilliantly funny and original screenwriter Mike White, who wrote School of Rock  and Chuck & Buck , two of my favorite films of the past 10 years. Black plays what sounds like a charmingly naughty underdog: a wide-eyed monk in a cassock named Ignacio, who is haunted by his forbidden thoughts, like his desire to make time with the sexy new nun (Ana de la Reguera), but mostly by his dream of escaping his life of pious drudgery to become a Lucha Libre wrestler, a sinfully invincible masked superfighter.
Yet if you go to this movie, here is what you will see: Jack Black, in a curly mop of hair and a mustache that's like the mirror image of his twitchy, turned-up eyebrows, looking like Avery Schreiber in the old Doritos commercials as he speaks in a chintzy Mexican accent and drops the occasional ha-ha American anachronism like ''Whatever!'' or ''It sucks to be me!'' Ignacio breaking wind, riding around the hills in his imbecilic scooter-with-a-giant-basket, or clenching his mighty butt cheeks together. Ignacio, who works as a cook in his remote desert monastery, serving orphans meals that resemble mole sauce mixed with merde. Ignacio donning a red cape and shorts, baby blue tights, and a head-hugging demonic mask to become Nacho, his secret wrestling alter ego, which becomes the occasion for Black to leap around the ring in fits of camp vanity as he flaunts his spectacularly terrible body  not just the thrusting big ball of a belly, but the flat chest and arms, the nascent hint of man-breasts, the whole pathetic muscle-free package.
Are you laughing yet? You'd better be, because that's about all there is to Nacho Libre . It's a comedy made by people who seem to think they're doing more than they're doing, which is making a mildly offbeat Adam Sandler comedy with an innocuous racist tinge of Mexicans-are-good-for-a-cheap-laugh sarcasm. The film was shot south of the border, with a mostly local crew, and you can almost taste the ticky-tackiness and squalor, but to what end? This is the sort of movie in which Nacho 's tag-team partner  yes, it's a buddy comedy  is a bag of bones named Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez), whose main activities are showing off his grunge teeth and, at one point, hooking up with an obese lady who boasts an even more crooked-toothed smile.
Black, you can tell, keeps wishing that he could just let loose and become Jack Black  which he does on a couple of occasions when he's singing, at which point you're relieved but also depressed, since it's clear that the whole Ignacio/Nacho character is too thin a conceit to entertain even the  actor playing him. The wrestling scenes have little farcical zest, since real wrestling is already too  stylized to stylize. As filmmakers, Jared Hess and Mike White must have wanted to make Nacho  a beautiful loser who triumphs, but they neglected to give him that glimmer of soul  the one that might have shined a bit brighter down the road on late-night cable, where Nacho Libre , I fear, will look pretty much as mirthless as it does now.

 GENTLER than Jim Carrey, more playful than Ben Stiller, able to leap tall tales in a single bound, Jack Black is the one guy in American movie theaters right now who knows how to coax out the genuine article, the laugh that begins by tickling your belly before it starts shaking you silly. In his endearingly ridiculous new film, "Nacho Libre," he plays a crusader of sorts in mask and cape, working his daft magic well enough to suggest that he just might be the missing comic link between a smarmy-pants like Vince Vaughn and a "what-me-worry" naïf like Will Ferrell.  A sweet bliss-out cooked up by the writers Mike White, Jerusha Hess and Jared Hess, who also directed, the film finds Mr. Black front and center as Nacho, a half-Mexican, half-Scandinavian monastery cook from Oaxaca, who aches to belong to another brotherhood, that of the luchadores, or masked wrestlers. Orphaned at a tender age and reared  in the monastery, Nacho wears the humble robe and sandals of a penitent. But underneath the Friar Tuck exterior lurks the heart, soul and fast feet of a ringmaster, a man born to knee drop on an opponent's head as effortlessly as a prima ballerina executing an échappé sauté. And beneath the heart, soul and feet? A performer burning to deliver us into joy.  Comic actors are always looking for love, but one of Mr. Black's signatures is how belligerently he solicits our affection. Unafraid of looking like a jerk, he has carved out a modest but memorable screen niche playing self-aggrandizers  — the music-store snob in "High Fidelity," the preening music teacher in "The School of Rock"  — who walk and talk much bigger than they actually are, sometimes because they're totally clueless, sometimes because they're not. Yet even at their most aggressively unself-conscious, say, as the director in  "King Kong," the characters invariably arrive at a moment in the story when they seem compelled to expose their soft underbelly to us, like the misunderstood pit bull that really just wants to cover you with kisses.  Nacho, who rustles up the monastery's daily beans and chips, is cut from softer cloth than most of Mr. Black's characters. Crucially, he adores the other orphans, who help tether him to the monastery, even after he steps into the wrestling ring. As in Jared Hess's breakout, "Napoleon Dynamite," character is plot in the film, and what drives the story, ever so leisurely, aren't events and incidents, but simpler things, like Nacho's inherent decency and his vanity. (He's a sucker for white ankle boots.) Just as important are his evolving relationships with his fight partner, Esqueleto (a terrific Héctor Jiménez), and with the distractingly beautiful Sister Encarnación (Ana de la Reguera), who looks rather like the nun Penélope Cruz played in Pedro Almodóvar's "All About My Mother."  Mr. Almodóvar dedicated his film, in part, "to men who act and become women." The writers of "Nacho Libre" don't unpack gender as elegantly as Mr. Almodóvar does,  but they don't have to: like "Napoleon Dynamite" (which the Hesses, who are married, wrote) and "Chuck & Buck" (Mr. White's feverish brainchild), this film starts from the premise that masculinity is nothing if not fluid. Here, then, is a true rarity: a Hollywood comedy in which a man with a thing for the ladies (O.K., nuns) makes nice, sometimes in tights, and no one even thinks to call him a sissy because no one in the film thinks in such stupid terms. As Nacho explains matter of factly, "When you are a man sometimes you wear stretchy pants in your room. It's for fun." Well, of course.  Mr. Black delivers those lines with the lilting singsong you hear in Mexican or, rather, Mexican-accented English, but, like everything else in the film, both the accent and the delivery are  strategically out of the realm of the real. Like Peter Sellers's floridly Teutonic voice in "Dr. Strangelove," you hear the quotation marks in the delivery and the thought that goes into every phrasing. That gives the lines chew  — Mr. Black's arrhythmic use of the word "whatever" verges on the Brechtian  —  and it also works to the film's liberating vision of identity as a performance space, an existential wrestling ring, if you will, in which each of us, if only given the opportunity, can cavort freely in the mask and colored tights of our choosing.  "Nacho Libre" marks a nice step forward for Jared Hess, who has started to shake some of the tics  — the obsessively symmetrical setups, the menagerie of user-friendly geeks  — that gave "Napoleon Dynamite" the flavor of an American Gothic pastiche, David Byrne's "True Stories" as recycled for the Sundance generation. He still leans too heavily on bad grooming and body fat for giggles and can carelessly slide into cruelty. But perhaps because he's operating outside his country and perhaps, as a consequence, his comfort zone, he doesn't seem as eager to sell his characters out for a laugh. And, in any event, I'm not sure that Jack Black or at least Nacho would let him. To be honest, it's the sweetness here that kills. If the whole thing weren't so gloriously nonsensical it just might make you cry.  "Nacho Libre" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some of the ring action may be a bit intense for wee ones, though the double-entendres should fly right over their heads.   

Although its marketing campaign stresses Jack Black in tights, "Nacho Libre" strikes a delicate balance of whimsy and absurdity that may surprise auds primed to expect wall-to-wall slapstick. Helmer Jared Hess' followup to "Napoleon Dynamite" is a more traditionally commercial comedy that nonetheless percolates with the same quirky off-centeredness that infused his 2004 cult fave. Even auds immune to the earlier pic's eccentric charms may enjoy the deftly muted zaniness of this fable about a would-be Mexican grappler's misadventures. This family-friendly, PG-rated pic looks primed to pin a leggy theatrical run. 
Black often appears aglow with a pixilated sweetness in his appealingly loopy star turn as Ignacio, an orphan raised by friars in a Mexican monastery. (Pic neatly finesses the potentially troublesome issue of the thesp's unmistakable gringo-ness by explaining the character's mom was a Scandinavian missionary.)
Ignacio labors devoutly as the monastery's cook, making the most of meager means -- very, very
 meager means -- while preparing a steady menu of bland gray gruel for the friars and the orphans in their care.
Relentlessly driven to provide a more varied bill of fare -- and boyishly eager to impress lovely young Sister Encarnacion (telenovella
 vet 
Ana de le Reguera), a new addition to the monastery staff -- Ignacio wants to join the ranks of Lucha Libre 
wrestlers, those larger-than-life kings of the ring who are idolized throughout Mexico. The friars forbid such worldly activities, but Ignacio plans to wrestle under the pseudonym Nacho and to wear a concealing mask -- just like his idol Ramses (real-life luchador 
Cesar Gonzalez), the reigning champion.
Even after he finds a tag-team partner in Esqueleto (Hector Jimenez), an impossibly skinny street fighter with bad teeth and worse social skills, Ignacio fares poorly as a macho luchador. 
Although he earns a tidy sum even when he loses to ferocious midgets or golden-ager grapplers, he wants to prove he has what it takes to rank with the greats. And failing that -- well, he'd like to beat somebody, anybody, at least once.
"Nacho Libre" lopes along a fairly predictable course, heading toward a climactic match in which Nacho butts heads with the haughty Ramses. Working from a script he concocted with wife Jerusha Hess (who also collaborated on "Napoleon Dynamite") and Mike White (co-writer, with Jack Black, of "The School of Rock"), Hess treats his familiar plot merely as an excuse to string together scenes of straight-faced looniness and mock-serious dialogue.
Whenever Ignacio rouses himself to speechify dramatically or sing soulfully, auds can safely expect some sort of punchline.Black's ability to temper wild-eyed excess with heartfelt sincerity (or some reasonable facsimile thereof) keeps Ignacio endearing throughout.
"Chaplinesque" is a word that gets tossed about much too freely (and inaccurately) by critics, but it's easy to spot the similarities between Ignacio's earnest efforts in the square circle and Charlie Chaplin's desperate measures during the classic boxing match in "City Lights."
With the considerable help of stunt coordinator Nick Powell ("Braveheart," "Gladiator"), Black plows through the wrestling scenes with a robust flair that is at once graceful and hilarious.
Filmed entirely on location in Mexico, "Nacho Libre" showcases many local talents on either side of the cameras. Effectively low-key supporting perfs by Jimenez and de la Reguera are perfectly suited for pic in which nothing, not even a camel clutch or a body slam, ever is allowed to get too far out of hand.
Standout tech contributors include lenser Xavier Perez Grobet ("Before Night Falls") and costumer Graciela Mazon ("Once Upon a Time in Mexico").
Pic overall is affectionately respectful in its treatment of Lucha Libre 
 -- aud is invited to laugh, but not at, the wrestlers and their enthusiastic fans -- which should please those who viewed "Napoleon Dynamite" as somehow condescending to its nerdy characters. Of course, the presence of Caesar Gonzalez and other real-life luchadores
 in the cast may partially account for absence of jeering mockery. After all, would you want to get those guys angry?

There is no movie more overrated in recent history than Napoleon Dynamite  ; it's to cinema what the Doors are to rock and roll, a thing blindly and inexplicably championed as if it were a religion above being blasphemed by nonbelievers. And every time someone tries to explain its appealthe deadpan comedy that plays like Bergman drama, the geek love that smells like self-loathing, the catchphrases that drop like rat pellets it just slips a little further from my grasp, though I might watch a movie entirely about Uncle Rico and his attempts to throw a football over them mountains. Even the nine-minute short from which it sprang was some seven minutes too long, suggesting writer-director Jared Hess  possesses a febrile mind unable to focus long enough on things like character or storyin other words, the basics of moviemaking.
So it's of some relief to announce that Nacho Libre , the latest from Hess (and co-writers Mike White  and Jerusha Hess , Jared's wife), isn't an entirely unpleasant experience, which is to say it doesn't feel as though it's worn out its welcome before the second reel. It takes slightly longer before its gears begin to slip and its jokes begin to wear and its laughs begin to fade; it's only 30 to 45 minutes too long, and therefore a marked improvement for a filmmaker who approached the medium with the attention deficiency of a TV sketch comedy writer. Or maybe a little Jack Black  goes a long way.
Black, tenacious in tight pants of various shades, plays the titular Nacho, a kid raised in a Mexican orphanage who dreams of becoming a luchador , with a superhero's mask obscuring his round face in the wrestling ring. The entirety of the movie deals with his sneaking out of the orphanage, where he's a cook charged with doling out black-bean gruel topped with stale nacho remnants, to wrestle with a scrawny thief named Esqueleto (Héctor Jiménez ). There is a love interest tooa nun named Sister Encarnación, played by Mexican soap opera star Ana de la Reguera, who looks exactly like Paz Vega  and Penélope Cruz . See it today and forget it tomorrowthat's the mantra of Nacho Libre , which has some memorable lines that want to be catchphrases, if only they didn't slip from your grasp.
The whole endeavor rests on the flabby shoulders of Black, who spends almost the entire film jiggling his shirtless frame across the widest of screens; he rivals Will Ferrell  in his desire to use his man tits to elicit cheap titters. Black, rested from his restrained performance against the green screens of King Kong , bounces back like he's been released from detention in the School of Rock  and allowed to roam the empty hallways without supervision. Nacho Libre  plays like a Jack Black best-of, down to the song he wrote and performs for de La Reguera that sounds like some Tejano version of a Tenacious D  throwaway. And where some might find his accent a tad offensive, it's so innocuous it plays like the tomfoolery of a child who doesn't know any better. Nacho's an idiot, no more and no less, because otherwise he'd disappear completelylike his movie, 20 minutes after you walk out of the theater.
