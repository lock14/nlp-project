It must be a relief to The Fantastic Four
 co-creator Stan Lee (with the late, great Jack Kirby) that he�s finally hit cinematic pay dirt over the past half-decade. Long in the tooth but still as giddy and seemingly awestruck by the thrill of it all at 83-years-young, Lee has seen a flurry of Marvel Comics-owned properties (perhaps most importantly his beloved Peter Parker, aka the spectacular Spider-Man
) prove the naysayers wrong: The comic book medium can
 translate to the screen with its integrity intact. Thanks in no small part to fantasy filmmaking�s ever-more-integral CGI effects having finally matched pace with Lee�s fertile, febrile, early-Sixties, four-color, pulp-paper imagination, Lee can saunter off to that great bullpen in the sky knowing Hollywood finally got it right. Just not this
 time. Oddly directed by Tim Story (last seen helming the disastrous Jimmy Fallon travesty Taxi
), this is the origin story of brainiac sci-fi guy Reed Richards (Gruffudd), his capable lady love Sue Storm (Alba), her cocksure, testosterone-bomb of a kid brother Johnny Storm (Evans), and friend-to-the-end Ben Grimm (Chiklis), and what happens to them after they�re saturated by radiation from a cosmic storm while orbiting the Earth in the name of Saving Mankind. Along with creepy billionaire and early rival for Sue Storm�s affections Victor Von Doom (McMahon) the four return to terra firma with � gulp! � fantastic
 new abilities. Richards is now the Richard Feynman version of Elasticman, Sue can turn invisible and create force fields at will, hothead Johnny is as combustible as ever, but he can now fly, too. It sounded like a swell deal to me at the age of 10, for everyone but poor Ben Grimm, who turns into a lumbering, orange boulder, know known as the Thing. Speaking of which, one of the best things about Lee and Kirby�s original comics were the Ben Grimm character � tortured that he�d lost the ability to be regarded as anything but a freak by the public-at-large (shades of X-Men
�s eternal plight) and always dreading that his blind sweetheart Alicia Masters (Washington) might someday trade him in for a newer, less metamorphic schisthead. Here, Chiklis, the psychotic cop of The Shield
, nails the character�s raging self-pity despite the dodgy foam rubber suit he�s stuck wearing. When Von Doom, in a major plotting change from the source material, slowly transforms into the steely-visaged and gray-cloaked supervillain Dr. Doom, only Chiklis� Thing seems up to the task of clobberin� not only the bad guy but the half-hearted dialogue as well. Michael France and Mark Frost�s script is chock full o� nuts and bolts but lacks any real core of emotion, and even a 10-year-old could tell you that�s
 what made Stan Lee�s characters so instantly identifiable, not to mention culturally durable. The vapid romance between Reed Richards and Sue Storm plays like bad daytime television, while McMahon�s rendering of Von Doom comes off like Donald Trump channeling Josef Goebbels � it ain�t a pretty sight. Only Chiklis� Thing and, to a lesser degree, Chris Evans� Human Torch (who pretty much acts like you�d expect a male teenager with the power to melt both evildoers' minds and young girls' hearts) generate any emotion. Weighted down with a turgid story and utterly middling special effects, The Fantastic Four
 isn�t likely to be Stan Lee�s favorite of the nearly dozen Marvel Comics adaptations either out already or on their way (hello, Luke Cage
). Look at it this way, Stan: After this mediocrity, no one�s even going to remember Roger Corman�s godawful bargain-basement 1994 version. Which, on second thought, had a lot more heart than this one.


"Fantastic Four" is based on the Marvel Comics title that has lasted for more than 500 issues since its first appearance in 1961. But after watching this dramatically inert movie, you might assume its source was the cartoons of Hanna-Barbera.
This is not simply because one of the four is a hard-charging man-creature made entirely of scaly, orange rock. Nearly everybody in the film exists in an exasperating state of doofiness that makes Yogi Bear seem borderline existential.
The movie gets underway when four nice people head into outer space on a science experiment funded by a nasty, brilliant businessman and come back to New York City, having survived a gnarly cosmic storm that has altered their chemical compositions and physical appearances. Given how monotonous the characters are during the first 15 minutes, these would have to be changes for the better.
Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) can now plasticize his body, making it expand and contort at will. His ex-girlfriend, Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), can create transparent, sometimes violent force fields and become invisible.
Sue's thrill-seeking brother Johnny (Chris Evans) can turn into flame. Their colleague Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) was closest to the storm, which transforms him into the aforementioned hulking, gruff-voiced Thing.
And that businessman, the extravagantly named Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), discovers he is made completely of titanium and will have to compete with Reed for Sue's attention.
What these mutations inspire is a bad superhero comedy that takes its time going nowhere. Much of it is centered around poor, pathetic Ben, who's depressed that his horrified wife has left him. In one sequence, he sits atop a bridge where a bird perches on him and relieves itself. Then he scares a suicidal man into oncoming traffic in an attempt to save him. That mishap provokes massive crashes and imperils bystanders whom Ben and friends rescue.
This is supposed to be a bravura sequence. Ben, for instance, stops an oncoming truck simply by letting it smash into him, the metal warping around his body. But the image is too familiar to be rousing. (Didn't the Hulk do the same thing? Didn't somebody in a ''Matrix" movie?) And the filmmakers fail to top it with a shot as remotely as exciting. Instead, the scene relies on jokes as flat as the acting by Gruffudd and Alba. When invisible Sue reappears in the scene wearing only her underwear, Reed observes, ''Wow, you've been working out!"
For a film about superheroes, ''Fantastic Four" gives its heroes nothing super to do. They wear fetching costumes and quite literally loaf around Reed's loft/megalab until the obligatory showdown with Dr. Doom, the masked electric storm Victor turns into. Reed, of course, wants everyone confined as he tries to reverse their ''infection" and make them ''normal" again.
The movie's problem is that these people were never all that interestingly human to begin with. That's partially an inherited problem. ''The Fantastic Four" was one of the more problematic series in the Marvel universe because its heroes were almost too ordinary. The four were mid-20th-century social archetypes jammed into a sort of makeshift dysfunctional family whose bond made the comic a knowing cross between a 1950s sitcom and a science-fiction B-picture. The title's creators, Jack Kirby and Stan Lee (who makes a cameo as a mailman), were experimenting by wedding divergent American themes (rebellion, elitism, heroism) and exploring the disharmony that ensued.
Roger Corman executive-produced a little-seen movie version of ''Fantastic Four" in 1994. It wasn't very good, but it did at least strive for the blend of cheesiness and emotional sincerity that made the comic interesting. Needless to say, that combination fails to surface in this newer version, which is a desperate bid for franchise status and not much else.
What the movie lacks most is a real sense of adventure. Any project starring people made of plastic, metal, fire, or rock should really be out exploring the erotic possibilities. New love for Ben comes in the form of the lovely Kerry Washington (''Ray"). Here she plays a blind woman, and while the pair are strangely sexy together, the movie moves on too fast.
The absence of psychological depth and visceral bang in ''Fantastic Four" makes you hungry both for ''The X-Men" and ''Spider-Man," two thrillingly perceptive Marvel-to-movie series, and for ''The Incredibles," a film that owes some of its family dynamic to Kirby and Lee's comic.
''Fantastic Four" lacks the wit and personality that fueled ''The Incredibles." The two credited screenwriters, Mark Frost and Michael France, don't fashion characters so much as models for a video game, and the director Tim Story, late of ''Barbershop" and the painfully dumb ''Taxi," seems too busy overseeing the effects and explosions to notice, for example, that the charismatic Evans wants to seize the occasion to become a star.
The actor is wasting his time. A movie as inconsequential as ''Fantastic Four" isn't worth stealing.


         Fantastic is a tough adjective to live up to and "Fantastic Four" takes its best shot, but it fails to be anything more than a mild summertime diversion. Based on the Marvel comic book, it's a prototypical air conditioner movie — it's probably only worth 10 bucks if your apartment is really, really hot or if you're a Jessica Alba completist.
 
  More superhero sitcom than comic book adventure, the movie lacks a strong, dramatic through-line. It's a series of connected, angst-ridden subplots that don't add up to a feature film. Director Tim Story ably moves things along but never succeeds in making the sum greater than its parts. Though their powers may be super, these characters are way too self-involved to be heroic.
 


         






    "Fantastic Four" dives quickly into the story of scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd, TV's Horatio Hornblower) and his astronaut-sidekick, Ben Grimm ("The Shield's" Michael Chiklis), as they warily approach their archrival, billionaire industrialist Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon of "Nip/Tuck") to fund a space mission in which they plan to unlock secrets of human genetics. Once a deal is struck, they're quickly joined on the interstellar flight by Von Doom's director of genetic research, Sue Storm (Alba), and her hotshot NASA dropout brother Johnny (Chris Evans).
 
  The cosmic storm Reed sought to explore for his research arrives early, causing an accident that exposes the crew to dangerous amounts of radiation. Back on Earth they quickly recover from their injuries but begin to display what might understatedly be referred to as side effects.
 
  Johnny exhibits a tendency to burst into flames, Sue becomes invisible when emotionally engaged, and Reed develops the elasticity of silly putty. Though these "gifts" come and go, Ben is saddled with a more permanent affliction: His body has mutated into a mass of solid, rock-like material that gives him super strength but makes him a little hard to look at. Director Story and screenwriters Mark Frost and Michael France nimbly present the symptoms following the accident and then wittily demonstrate the relationship to each character's personality. The audience is always a step ahead of the jokes, but the recognition is part of its fun.
 
  Rock star celebrity follows as the Human Torch, the Invisible Woman, Mr. Fantastic and the Thing, as they are soon tagged by Johnny, are forced to face Brangelina-size paparazzi and fan attention, as well as the threat of Von Doom, who undergoes a startling physical transformation of his own. The filmmakers have some fun spoofing the drawbacks of unwanted fame, but that thread tends to exemplify the problem the film has in deciding if it wants to be "Ghostbusters" or "X-Men."
 
  These aren't necessarily warring sensibilities, and a more skillful execution would have elevated "Fantastic Four" to another level of comic-book movie. The filmmakers seem to have been straining for a more complex hybrid genre — one in which the humor and action serve the story equally — than they were able to deliver. As is often the case with big-budget action movies, the central story is simply not strong enough to support the ambition.
 
  The mishmash of stories is as hit-and-miss as the film's many gags. Johnny embraces his new powers, even trying to expand upon them by learning to fly, and Evans leaps into the part with bravado and gets most of the script's best lines. Chiklis projects a big hunk of humanity through layers of prosthetics as the Thing, and McMahon is suitably despicable as the preening villain. The chemistry between Gruffudd and Alba, however, as the supposed love interests, recalls a DC Comics character — Mr. Freeze.
 
  "Fantastic Four" works best during its first half establishing the alliterative quartet's super powers after the accident transforms their DNA. Once that's established, the movie loses its way and it becomes clock-watching time. Still, Story, who directed "Barbershop," is surprisingly adept at handling the action sequences and special effects, most of which are excellent.
 
  The Fantastic Four were originally created in the early 1960s as dysfunctional superheroes in contrast to the more idealized heroes previously seen in comics and pop culture in general. The filmmakers have picked up on that, continuing the in-fighting and tendencies to screw up. Ultimately, they aren't trying to save the world, they're merely trying to save themselves. It's a lesson in self-acceptance and a metaphor worthy of Dr. Phil, but it isn't all that entertaining.

Most big-screen versions of comic books strive to hip-ify their subjects. Not Fantastic Four . This clumsy, cheesy, chintzy adaptation, with its F/X that look dated the moment you see them, is like something left over from the '60s, the heyday of Marvel's longest-running series. Square and goofy at the same time, it reduces its power-packed heroes to figures of innocuous low comedy, turning their ''normal'' selves into soap-opera ciphers. When Dr. Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and his team of astronaut scientists are engulfed by radiation that transforms their DNA, their new abilities are played for lite laughs. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), the clownish hothead who becomes the Human Torch, cooks Jiffy Pop in his palm. Reed, the stretchy Mr. Fantastic, flexes his limber limbs by reaching across the hall for toilet paper, and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), the Invisible Woman, keeps getting caught with her clothes off. Then there's Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), whose transformation into the Thing, that walking hulk of cracked granite, with his Quasimodoid self-pity, is the closest the film comes to giving a character a tidbit of a dilemma  i.e., a personality. Chiklis, growling like a Damon Runyon lug, makes him a genial hellguy, which is more than I can say for the other three actors, who compete in blandness. After the spectacle of Spider-Man 2 , the psychodramatic grip of Batman Begins , the slapstick genius of The Incredibles , who needs these cardboard heroes anyway? They are far  too far  from super.

 If you like your special effects- driven summer action blockbusters slick, seamless and state of the art, then "Fantastic Four" may not be for you. While the superpowers and their consequences - flames, stretchy limbs, force fields and so on - no doubt required a great deal of money and expertise to bring to the screen, they look cheap and cheesy. Which may be the point. In an era when movies based on comic books have become increasingly solemn and serious, this one is content to be trashy. Compared with the psychological probing and spiritual brooding of "Batman Begins," "Fantastic Four" is proudly dumb, loud and inconsequential. It is not an allegory, an archetypal tale of good and evil, or the cinematic equivalent of a graphic novel. It's a comic book.  And a venerable one at that, since it was the Four, back in 1961, who helped to put Marvel Comics on the map, making the world safe for Spiderman, the Hulk, the X-Men and the whole Marvel stable of introspective genetic anomalies. The group's movie debut is a standard origin story, in which the characters acquire and master their powers and confront their nemesis, one Dr. Doom. With its clumsy rhythms and indifferent acting, the movie, directed by Tim Story ("Barbershop") from a script by Mark Frost and Michael France, is more like a television pilot than a big-screen epic, and its sequels would probably play best in half-hour increments on Saturday morning.  These days, though, television is probably too smart for a lowest-common-denominator product like "Fantastic Four," which is fantastic only in its commitment to mediocrity. If the filmmakers are trying for a spoofy, light-hearted tone, they succeed only to the point of making the picture unintentionally funny. When Jessica Alba first appears on screen, introduced as Sue Storm, an M.I.T.-trained scientist who specializes in genetic research, the audience may snicker. But really, Ms. Alba - who has certainly made the most of her own genetic advantages - is no more laughable in such a role than Ioan Gruffudd, who does his best to achieve the emotional depth and physical grace of a plastic action figure. Mr. Gruffudd plays Reed Richards, a genius who has lost  the financing for his pet project, which involves both space travel and DNA sequencing.  Reed and Sue are former college sweethearts, but she is now involved with (and employed by) Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), a megalomaniacal tycoon who agrees to finance Reed's research. The three of them, along with Reed's pal Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) and Sue's reckless brother, Johnny (Chris Evans), spend a few moments on Victor's space station shouting nonsensical jargon  until a radioactive storm cuts the mission short. Back on Earth, they discover some unusual side effects. Reed's hair turns silver at the temples, and the rest of his body takes on the qualities of a rubber band; Johnny, on a snowboard run that is the film's best and most gratuitous action sequence, bursts into flame; Ben acquires Herculean strength and grows a stony carapace that sends his fiancée running in the other direction. (Later, she shows up on the Brooklyn Bridge, where the Four have made their daring-rescue debut, to return Ben's engagement ring. Luckily, a friendly blind woman, played by Kerry Washington, soon sees the appeal of a big, stony, four-fingered guy in a raincoat and baggy pants).  Sue, for her part, is able to make herself  invisible, and to generate powerful protective force fields, gifts that might serve Ms. Alba well in real life. Oddly enough, once the process of superpower acquisition is complete, very little remains for the superheroes, or the movie, to do. Ben - also known as The Thing - is the only one who suffers the kind of identity crisis that sometimes haunts sensitive superheroes, and Mr. Chiklis, under 60 pounds of latex, gives the most affecting performance in the movie. The others read their lines and stand around waiting for the special effects to kick in, and for the villain to work out his  identity crisis and drop the "Von" from his name. Apparently, Spiderman has already taken care of street crime, and the only non-Doom-related do-gooding to be done is a bit of suicide-prevention, which leads to further rescue opportunities. After that, the only thing left is to look at your watch and count the minutes until the sequel, or the next comic-book blockbuster.  "Fantastic Four" is rated PG  (Parental guidance suggested). It has some rough action sequences and a few half-naughty innuendoes.

Unpretentiousness counts for a lot in "Fantastic Four," a wildly uneven, sporadically slapdash action-adventure that amuses in fits and starts. Aimed at a younger crowd than most recent comicbook adaptations, pic lacks the type of serious subtext that lent real or imagined gravitas to the likes of "X-Men," "Batman Begins" and "Hulk." Parents should appreciate the kid-friendly superhero extravaganza, even as devoted readers of the revered Marvel Comic title howl in protest at the liberties taken. Fox release probably won't be a flameout in theatrical release, but won't clobber too many B.O. rivals, either.
Predictably, "Fantastic Four" plays like a typical "genesis story" designed to kick off a potential franchise. Script by Mark Frost ("Twin Peaks") and Michael France (remembered, though not forgiven, for his hand in "Hulk") is almost as far removed from original Stan Lee-Jack Kirby comic series as recent James Bond pics are from Ian Fleming novels. On its own terms, however, scenario serves as OK intro for eponymous quartet.
Recently bankrupted scientist Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) wants to rehabilitate his tarnished image (and return to financial solvency) by harnessing the forces of a cosmic storm in outer space. Along with astronaut buddy Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis), Reed seeks backing from billionaire industrialist Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon of TV's "Nip/Tuck"), who conveniently owns and operates his own space station. Trouble is, Victor also employs -- and ardently woos -- genetic researcher Sue Storm (Jessica Alba), Reed's ex-sweetheart.
Victor agrees to bankroll the mission, but only if he can accompany the crew -- and Johnny Storm (Chris Evans), Sue's hot-headed younger brother, can serve as pilot. Sue also comes along, placing her in the right place at the wrong time when the entire crew is bombarded with DNA-altering cosmic radiation.
When they return to Earth, the after-effects of the exposure gradually appears. Reed gains the power of stretching and contorting his body like industrial-strength rubber. Sue can make herself invisible and protect herself with equally transparent force fields. Johnny can burst into flames, toss fireballs and fly at will. 
And Ben? His transformation is a decidedly mixed blessing. He becomes superhumanly strong and formidably huge. The bad news is, he turns into an orange, rocky-skinned ogre with a pronounced resemblance to a Rice Krispie Bar.
Reed promises to experiment in his Manhattan laboratory to find a way to reverse the mutations. (Fans will be happy to see pic retains comicbook's famous setting, the fictitious Baxter Building.) While Ben is particularly eager to be restored to his former self -- even after he attracts romantic interest of a blind beauty played by Kerry Washington -- Johnny is first comicbook movie hero since Billy Zane's "The Phantom" who behaves as though he thinks being a superhero is pretty doggone cool.
Meanwhile, on the other side of Manhattan, Von Doom is going through changes of his own. His skin is slowly becoming flexible metal, and he's increasingly capable of generating electrical charges from his fingertips. 
Throughout the relatively brisk 106 minutes of "Fantastic Four," it's hard not to note echoes of the cartoonish superheroics in last year's "The Incredibles" (a pic obviously inspired by the Marvel comic series). But the free-wheeling jokiness and insult-swapping here are true to spirit to early issues of "Fantastic Four" comic (which debuted in 1961), and also serve to remind how much Ivan Reitman's comicbookish "Ghostbusters" (1984) owed to Marvel titles.
Overall lightness of tone does much to sustain audience's good will during displays of f/x that appear expensive and cheesy all at once. There is a rushed and slipshod feel to large swaths of pic, along with tell-tale signs of last-minute reshooting, recutting and rethinking. Among the more glaring continuity goofs: Ben storms past Johnny to go up 
in an elevator on his way out 
of the Baxter Building. Earlier, pic established that Ben couldn't ride the elevator due to his increased weight.
Helmer Tim Story evidences little in the way of visual flair or storytelling panache -- pic often comes off like a routine TV pilot -- but he does encourage the four leads to develop nicely seriocomic give-and-take. 
Evans gives a charismatic breakout performance that recalls Dennis Quaid's exuberant turn as Gordon Cooper in "The Right Stuff." 
Chiklis is thoroughly credible and hilariously blustery, despite handicap of wearing face and body makeup that never looks like anything but makeup. Gruffudd and Alba appear a shade too young for their parts, but acquit themselves reasonably well. McMahon might have done better to play a little bigger as Victor Von Doom. 
Inexplicably, family-friendly "Fantastic Four" has been branded PG-13, same MPAA rating applied to the darker, edgier and scarier "War of the Worlds" and "Batman Begins." Only possible explanation: occasional shots of Sue's underwear floating hither and yon while Sue herself remains unseen.

Stan Lee  and Jack Kirby  created The Fantastic Four  as an editorial imperative: Invent a superhero group to cash in on the popularity of DC Comics' Justice League of America . In transporting Lee and Kirby's epochal creation to the screen, director Tim Story  and writers Michael France  and Mark Frost  have much the same taskin the wake of the massively popular X-Men  franchise, streamline 40 years of comic-book history into an easily marketable 105-minute film. But while Lee and Kirby reworked an old formula into something wholly new, Story's superficial alterations only bring the picture in line with tired tent pole storytelling, forcing our heroes to fight off evil clichés when they should be fighting Doctor Doom (Julian McMahon ).
Lee and Kirby's ultimate contribution to their art form was their unique blend of dynamic action and fallible human characters. Story's Fantastic Four  misses the mark on both counts. As in the Marvel comics, Reed (Ioan Gruffudd ), Sue (Jessica Alba ), Johnny (Chris Evans ), and Ben (Michael Chiklis ) are transformed by exposure to cosmic radiation. But the action sequences reek of drudgery rather than adventure, and with the exception of Chiklis's remarkably soulful performance beneath 60 pounds of orange Thing makeup, all of the characters are flatter than their two-dimensional counterparts.
Before the inevitable and surprisingly anticlimactic battle with Doom, we are treated to two extreme-sports demonstrations, several training montages, an ill-advised love triangle, and a scene where massive billboards for Burger King , Pepsi , Mountain Dew , and SoBe dwarf our heroes. Fantastic four, indeed.
