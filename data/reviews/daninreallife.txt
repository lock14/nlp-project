If this is "real life," then count me out. It's not that there's anything terribly awful with it; it's just that what passes for real life in this film is as genially inoffensive and predictable as the average TV sitcom. Audiences are sure to reward Dan in Real Life
 with audible laugh tracks, but the laughter won't come in response to surprise or astonishment, only as the acknowledgment of a winning execution of a familiar comedic ploy. More had been hoped for in this second writer/director project from Hedges. His previous effort, Pieces of April
, followed a similar trajectory of family entanglement, though the characters had more edge and personality than they do in Dan in Real Life
. Hedges also wrote the screenplays for What's Eating Gilbert Grape?
 (from his own novel) and About a Boy
 (adapted from Nick Hornby's book), other works whose distinctive characters stand apart from mediocrity. This new film will garner Hedges his biggest audience, and let's hope that it allows him to return to his more quirkily crafted characterizations. Carell is in his subdued, Little Miss Sunshine
 seriocomic mode here as Dan Burns, a widower of four years whose life revolves around the care of his three daughters (Pill, Robertson, and Lawston) and his work as an advice columnist. Most of the movie takes place within the close confines of a family vacation gathering with his parents (Wiest and Mahoney) and brothers (Cook and Butz) and their families in a shambling North Carolina seashore abode. After a meet-cute with Marie (Binoche) at the local tackle shop/bookstore, Dan feels the sparks of affection for the first time since his wife's death, then is dismayed to discover back at the house that his inamorata is the girlfriend of his brother Mitch (Cook), a cad who, with Marie, has brought home the first girlfriend of whom his family has ever approved. Awkward situations ensue as Dan and Marie can't get together yet can't stay apart. An unendurable family talent-show sequence in the third act is somewhat compensated for with a lovely set-piece in a bowling alley. The family meddles, the Burns girls all have their issues, and The Devil Wears Prada
 scene-stealer Blunt shows up in a thankless role as a blind date. All goes according to course, and that's exactly the problem with Dan in Real Life
.


I think I'd respect Peter Hedges more if he just came out and admitted he's a big old softie. The novelist ("What's Eating Gilbert Grape") turned screenwriter ("About a Boy") turned director ("Pieces of April") apparently thinks he's cutting through the Hollywood bushwa with his smallish movies, but the digitally-shot "April" was a fake indie with a Hallmark soul and his new film, "Dan in Real Life," bears as much relation to the real real life as "The Game Plan" does to professional football.
Co-written with Pierce Gardner and co-starring Steve Carell and Juliette Binoche as mismatched lovers, the movie's cute and pleasant and trumped up and forgettable - a "quality" film without a spine. Carell plays Dan Burns, a newspaper advice columnist whose life is a shambles. There's a great movie to be had in the notion of a busybody whose advice keeps blowing up in his face, but "Dan in Real Life" merely sets it up and walks away.
Instead, Hedges spirits us to one of those large, fractious family gatherings that can be hard to take when the clan isn't your own (see: "The Family Stone"). Dan, a recent widower, has three daughters: sensible Jane (Alison Pill, wonderful), rebellious Cara (Brittany Roberts), and wise, adorable Lilly (Marlene Lawston). Cara, 14, is in love with a classmate with that pink-stationery passion reserved for teenage girls, and the spooked Dan packs everyone off to a weekend reunion at the lakeside home of his parents (John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest, adorable and wise).
On a run into town, Dan bumps into the wisely adorable Marie (Binoche) and is instantly smitten; returning home, it's revealed she's the new girlfriend of his lunkhead brother, Mitch (Dane Cook). Now, this is good: Carell excels at playing a smart, ardent guy having to squelch his emotions while feeling increasingly spiteful toward his happy-happy siblings and in-laws. Crossword-puzzle races, talent shows, Pictionary games - it's enough to lead a grown man to thoughts of murder.
Every time "Dan in Real Life" catches something true about human behavior, though - the way Dan and Marie subtly dance with each other in a local bar when they're supposedly dancing with others - Hedges sands off the edges with glibness. He arranges scenes rather than lets them happen: Dan accidentally sharing a shower stall with Marie, or the entire family piling into the hero's room, "Night at the Opera"-style, with unwanted advice.
These are funny bits, but you feel the hand of the director in every frame, guiding his characters toward tidy resolutions. "Dan in Real Life" embarks on an orgy of bow-tying at the end, making sure that all have their mates and that every life lesson has been learned. There's so little doubt left in the film you can barely breathe.
Binoche gamely dumbs down one of her complex Euro-heroines for US consumption but she's fundamentally miscast - she and Cook belong together like caviar and motor oil. Likewise, Carell struggles with playing a "good father" who's also a "bad dad" while trying to stay on the viewer's sunny side; he's best when collapsing into dark comic despair, as in a scene in which he hijacks his brother's sappy rendition of "Let My Love Open the Door" to his own miserable ends.
Roberts, as the swoony teen daughter, is a pain but at least she's a recognizable pain, and Emily Blunt owns her one scene as a local lady with a longstanding crush on Dan, mostly because the movie doesn't require anything more of her. Everyone else treads very carefully, worried the audience will turn against them.
Doesn't Hedges understand that's our problem, not his? There's a difference between liking your characters and insisting they be likable, and for all its aspirations toward life as it's lived, "Dan in Real Life" lacks the nerve of genuine storytelling. It's for moviegoers who would have preferred "Little Miss Sunshine" if that movie hadn't been so gosh-
darn dark.


Comedians with an edge who evolve into Hollywood actors tend to follow a familiar pattern. Over time, they get squishy, becoming all tender and ''humanized.'' Richard Pryor more or less set the template for this ritual of co-optation, and his example was followed by Robin ''I Love Me!'' Williams and Jim Carrey, who's had an on-again, off-again fling with domesticating his anarchy. Steve Carell, after The 40 Year-Old Virgin , already looked halfway to premature fogy-hood as the bearded yuppie Noah of Evan Almighty  (he liked doing that white-man dance a little too  much), and I was dreading the worst when I went to see Dan in Real Life , in which Carell plays a family-values newspaper columnist who is also the widowed father of three daughters. Would he find romance? Gag me!
The surprise is that Dan in Real Life  turns out to be a nimble and supple and moving comedy, and that Carell, instead of drowning in a bath of ''warmth,'' holds on to his inner wild man in the shrewdest way possible. Carell's Dan Burns is a good father, maybe a heroic one, but a bit overprotective; he's clenched with fear. Taking his bratty princess brood for a weekend reunion at his folks' idyllic home on the Rhode Island shore, he gets sucked into the swirl of parents, brothers, kids, and it's a shock to see a family house-party movie ruled by affection rather than backbiting. The first morning, Dan drives into town for a newspaper, and it's there he meets the one that he didn't dare hope to meet. Marie (Juliette Binoche) has glossy chestnut curls, an overbite to die for, and all the tenderness and moxie and understanding that a woman would need to want to be with a lonely man with three daughters.
Dan presses for her number, even though she's got a boyfriend, and then returns in a blissful daze. Only to learn that the boyfriend is...his brother Mitch (Dane Cook). And she's staying for the weekend! It's a jaw-dropper of a twist, and here's the thing: There's no enmity. Dan loves his bro, who looks like he might be settling down at last. Dan has to hold in his feelings  more than that, he has to try to kill them  and the whole movie spins around Carell's inspired performance as a man who is going quietly nuts because the universe has decided to toy with him. He pines, he simmers, he rages, he curses the gods  and he does it all under the radar, so that only the audience can see it. Well, okay, he also does another white-man dance, but this one is so furious, so expressive of everything he can't express, that it's worthy of a silent clown.
Dan in Real Life  was directed by Peter Hedges, who made the far shtickier Pieces of April  (2003), and the movie's fast wit never undercuts its decency. It's like a sitcom directed by Eric Rohmer. The film is so winning it got me to like Dane Cook  or at least to enjoy his puppyish narcissism when it's this well used. Binoche, radiant, gives the most direct performance she has in years. In the era of the fading chick flick, it's bracing to see a movie about two grown-ups who fall in love because they look as if they truly do need each other. Dan in Real Life  is a comedy of faith that, in its wised-up feel-good way, restores yours. A–

 Early in Peter Hedges’s “Dan in Real Life,” the title character, at a bookstore, meets the woman he will fall in love with. Mistaking him for an employee, she breathlessly tries to describe the kind of book she’s looking for. (He responds by gathering up a random assortment of volumes that includes the poems of Emily Dickinson, “Anna Karenina” and “Everybody Poops.”) “I want something funny,” she says. “But not laugh-out-loud funny. And definitely not making-fun-of-people funny. I want something human funny.”  It does not take long to recognize this as a declaration of the film’s own intentions. Its moral is “expect to be surprised,” and the surprise is how frequently it succeeds. “Dan in Real Life” is neither wildly farcical nor mockingly cruel, but rather, for the most part, winningly gentle and observant.  The film, with a script Mr. Hedges wrote with Pierce Gardner, follows Dan (Steve Carell), a widower with three daughters, to a family gathering at his parents’ rambling vacation home in Rhode Island. His encounter with that woman in the bookstore — her name is Marie, and she has the good fortune to be played by Juliette Binoche — leads to quite a bit of awkwardness. It turns out that she is the new girlfriend of Dan’s bachelor brother, Mitch (an astonishingly tolerable Dane Cook), and she’s joining the clan for the weekend.  It’s a big group, headed by John Mahoney and Dianne Wiest and including Dan’s three girls, a bunch of other kids and some fine grown-up actors like Amy Ryan and Norbert Leo Butz in too-small roles. Comic misunderstandings give way to hard feelings, which produce even bigger comic misunderstandings and harder feelings, and then before you know it the credits are rolling over an outdoor wedding scene while a cool-looking band sings a cool-sounding song.  But even though this denouement is the perfect-storm mother of all clichés, there are fewer of these along the way than you might expect. Yes, there is the maudlin back story of Dan’s widowhood, and  the familiar scenario  of all that quirky kin stuffed into one house for a few days. But Mr. Hedges, a seasoned screenwriter, showed in his directing debut, “Pieces of April,” that he could infuse tired conventions of domestic comedy with fresh life and real intelligence. And here, working in a less self-consciously eccentric mode, he does it again.  “Dan in Real Life” does not strain after big conceptual jokes, but rather finds humor in things people might actually say. The characters are funny not just to us but also to one another. Like most people, they use humor as a means of communication and self-defense, which gives the movie a genial, unhurried, lived-in feeling.  The story and the characters do wear a little thin in places. Ms. Binoche is radiant and lovely, and at 43 more than matches the sexiness of 24-year-old Emily Blunt, who shows up briefly as a potential romantic rival. (Both women are supposed to be around the same age as Dan, or Mitch, or something.) But exactly who Marie is, apart from the embodiment of wonderfulness, is never quite clear. Nor is it entirely plausible that she would fall for both the dim, genial Mitch and the cerebral, uptight Dan.  Dan, like many characters played by Mr. Carell, has the curious quality of seeming to be more complicated than he really is. The wary, wry detachment that he brings to each new role is starting to feel less like a hallmark than a sign of fatigue. And, as in the dreadful “Evan Almighty,” he is forced to depict a character learning valuable lessons. (The genius of Michael Scott, the manager he plays on “The Office,” is that Michael is congenitally impervious to learning.) Dan, a onetime novelist, now writes a parenthood  column, but though he is a conscientious father, he is not always understanding or compassionate.  Advice columnist, advise thyself! My own advice would be not to expect too much from “Dan in Real Life.” That way you can be pleasantly surprised.  “Dan in Real Life” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some sexually suggestive situations.

Gracefully understated and thoroughly engaging, "Dan in Real Life" deftly interlaces heart and humor in a witty, warm and well-observed comedy about the unexpected and inconvenient blooming of romance at the weekend gathering of an extended family. Pic more than fulfills the promise evidenced in "Pieces of April," the 2003 directorial debut of playwright-novelist-scriptwriter Peter Hedges ("About a Boy," "What's Eating Gilbert Grape"). From a B.O. perspective, his follow-up has the potential to delight a demographically diverse audience, and generate enough favorable word of mouth to register as one of the fall's true sleepers.
It's intended as high praise to note that, in sharp contrast to most other recent American-made laffers, there's a decidedly European air to Hedges' effort. Indeed, it's not at all difficult to imagine, say, Daniel Auteuil in the lead role winningly played here by Steve Carell.
Carell hits all the right notes while running the gamut from propriety to spontaneity as Dan Burns, writer of a newspaper column that gives the pic its title. In his column, Dan confidently dispenses advice to readers with burning questions about love, life and family matters. In his own life, however, Dan is uptight and overprotective as the widowed father of three young daughters: teenage Jane (Alison Pill), who's seldom allowed to use her new driver's license; middle child Cara (Brittany Robertson), who's much too young in Dan's view to have a boyfriend, much less an ardent suitor; and fourth-grader Lilly (Marlene Lawston), who's forgiving, but not entirely uncritical, of her father's way-uncool attitude.
Dan and his daughters aren't exactly bonding blissfully when they arrive at his parents' Rhode Island beach house for a semi-annual gathering of brothers and sisters, spouses and offspring. Dan's mother (Dianne Wiest) quickly realizes it might be good to separate father and daughters for a bit. So she sends Dan off to buy newspapers in a nearby town -- where, at a second-hand bookstore, he meets Maria (Juliette Binoche), who gets him to open up.
Here and elsewhere in "Dan in Real Life," Hedges and co-scripter Pierce Gardner demonstrate a beguiling ability to take intriguing detours while covering familiar territory. Dan and Marie "meet cute," of course. But their opening conversational gambits, involving recommended reading material, come off as fresh and funny.
The budding attraction is interrupted by a major complication: Marie turns out to be the visiting girlfriend of Mitch (Dane Cook), Dan's fitness-instructor brother. Yet instead of generating elaborate deceptions, slapstick farce and other broadly comic antics, this plot device leads to richly amusing incidents of anxiety, indecision and embarrassment, as Marie and Dan try to hide their mutual attraction -- and deny it to themselves and each other -- while unavoidably close in a crowded house.
"Dan in Real Life" leans toward the obvious only when Dan is pushed by his mother into a blind date with a former classmate (Emily Blunt), a stunning sexpot who arouses Marie's barely contained jealousy. It's not that Blunt goes over the top -- she stops short of that. But when she and Carell have a kind of dance-floor duel with Binoche and Cook, the scene, while undeniably funny, seems oddly odd of sync with the rest of the pic. (Moreover, the film isn't the rollicking laff-riot it's being be sold as in coming-attraction trailers that could turn off many of the very ticketbuyers who may enjoy it most.)
"Dan" works best when the humor flows directly from the basic set-up and the interacting central characters. Binoche is charming throughout -- her accent is attributed to her character's many and varied travels -- but she's most endearing when Marie and Dan are sharing their own private jokes about their complicated situation.
Supporting performances are aces across the board. If Dane Cook merits specific mention, it's because his fine work here (much like his under-rated turn in "Mr. Brooks") suggests he could be at the start of interesting film-acting career marked by the smart balancing of lead and supporting roles.
Tech package impresses without undue slickness. Sarah Knowles' production design is precise and evocative, right down to the look of the laundry room at the beach house, and the tattered copy of Arthur Knight's "The Liveliest Art" displayed at the second-hand bookstore. Original tunes composed and performed by Sondre Lerche are expressively melodic pop ditties bound to boost the soundtrack's CD sales. Here, too, pic avoids the expected: The usual string of Top 40 standards and currently charting notables is conspicuous by its absence.

One could fill this entire space with the titles of films from which writer-director Peter Hedges  nicks his story, but for the sake of expediency, we'll narrow it down to a desert-island handful: Home for the Holidays , The Family Stone , Sleepless in Seattle , What About Bob? , and Hedges's own excellent Thanksgiving-dinner- flavored Pieces of April . Add to this cinematic stew your own castSteve Carell  as the widower with three young girls, Dane Cook  as the brother, Juliette Binoche  as the brother's girlfriend, Dianne Wiest  and John Mahoney  as the parents, Emily Blunt  as the blind date, and assorted other familiar faces posing as family members gathered in an idyllic oceanside spotand the dots connect themselves. The charitable might view Dan in Real Life  as a sort of spiritual sequel to The 40-Year-Old Virgin : Dan's the little man Andy might have become had his One True Love abandoned him with three children to whom he can't connect, because every time he looks at them he sees the remnants of his former life. Or it could just be that Dan in Real Life  steals from that line in Virgin  about Carell kinda looking like Luke Wilson , since here Carell is, after all, playing the Luke Wilson role from The Family Stone .
