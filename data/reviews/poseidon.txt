The anthropomorphized bunnies of Watership Down
 had more pizzazz than the entire cast of this pointless and histrionic exercise in big-budget Hollywood remakes. Come to think of it, if director Wolfgang Petersen (no stranger to submersibles, he helmed the brilliant, World War II-era U-Boat suspenser Das Boot
) had cast his film with no one but a Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea
-era Peter Lorre, there'd be plenty more sympathy for the soggy characterizations within, but, tough luck for us, Lorre's long-gone dead, and Petersen seems to have lost his once-fine sense of narrative flow in the briny backwash of 2000's The Perfect Storm
. That film was a kicky, often gripping summer popcorn movie that had, at its core, a group of characters that you might actually want to spend some time with, were they not all, you know, dead. Nothing approaching the unbridled acting prowess of Mark Wahlberg is on display here, however, and what is
 watchable � the giant rogue wave that capsizes the gargantuan pleasure-craft Poseidon
, various and sundry explosions, waterlogged corpses bob-bob-bobbin' along � is so formulaic and poorly shot that it hardly bears viewing. (Come to think of it, James Cameron did a much better job, giant CGI wave included, nearly two decades ago in The Abyss
.) Producer Irwin Allen's 1972 original, The Poseiden Adventure
, at least had Shelley Winters and Ernest Borgnine to liven up the disastrous proceedings. Poseidon
 can only manage Josh Lucas (Glory Road)
 and Kurt Russell, who seems to be phoning it in from Planet Plissken. The story, if not the stakes, remains the same: On New Year's Eve, at the stroke of midnight, the good ship Poseidon
 is spun ass-over-teacup by a killer wave, trapping the passengers in a suddenly upside-down hell of premoistened misery. A handful, led by scalawag Dylan Johns (Lucas), make their way up to the bottom of the ship, which burbles atop the swells like some Bizarro World-Titanic. A handful of talented actors � Russell, Dreyfuss, Dillon � checked their egos at the door in hopes of � something
, but this Poseidon
 is a wash, right down to the jarringly loud/soft/loud score by Klaus Badelt (Catwoman)
. So where to lay the blame? I'm going with screenwriter Mark Protosevich (The Cell)
, whose sense of characterization and backstory (extremely important in an ensemble film such as this) is almost completely absent, which means, when everything suddenly goes topsy-turvy and people begin dying in new and fascinating ways, you really don't see much of a reason to either care about or identify with them. It's all so much blood and brine signifying nothing, not even a good time. Now somebody do us all a favor and cut that albatross from around Petersen's neck already.

         Let's just say that Wolfgang Petersen's remake of Irwin Allen's 1972 disaster classic "The Poseidon Adventure" rings more bells than Quasimodo at noon, and all you hear is a knell. The movie is set on a luxury liner sailing for New York from parts unmentioned, but it doesn't amount to much more than a prison escape movie on high seas.
 
  Supposedly, the film's back story was cut to a nub because it wasn't playing. Or maybe Petersen and writer Mark Protosevich didn't play with it enough before sailing, and it died of neglect. More than characters, dialogue and lighting, here Petersen is interested exclusively in suspense of the will-he-or-won't-he-be-crushed-by-that-falling-flaming-elevator variety. It's "Das Perfect Boot" — with the characters compressed to wafers. And I mean that both ways.
 


         






    Not that one begrudges the major luxury cruise brands from shying away from product placement, but seriously, for a floating pleasure-dome, the Poseidon is a little on the grim side. If I were a passenger, I'd demand to speak with Kathie Lee. Where are all the fun activities? The five-star gourmet dining experiences? The rock-climbing walls? The magic acts? The all-you-can-eat buffets? And why don't we ever get a grand tour of the facilities before disaster strikes? I don't think I glimpsed so much as a porthole, never mind any of the touching "Love Boat"-style introductions intrinsic to the genre. Honestly, if not even one homely, overweight couple is going to announce that they're celebrating their 50th anniversary/longed-for retirement/second honeymoon and whip out pictures of the grandkids, I'm just not going to care. And where, for the love of God, is the put-upon cabin crew?
 
  As it happens, on the Poseidon, only those passengers who resemble recognizable actors matter. In the brief initial moments before disaster strikes, we meet Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), steely jock, as he jogs along the deck and past the cabin of young lovers Jennifer (Emmy Rossum) and Christian (Mike Vogel). The youngsters are necking provocatively on the couch of her father's enormous crib and fretting about how to inform him of their engagement. Dad is Robert Ramsey (Kurt Russell), a former firefighter turned former mayor of New York and a most inopportune barger-inner. He thoroughly disapproves of the match, and yet it remains unclear what the three of them are doing on a cruise together. Pouring himself a Scotch, he insists that Christian quit making him feel old by calling him "sir," then hits the kids with the "technically, you're still under my roof" speech. Jennifer fires back with "I'm over your patronizing tone," and stalks off. And yet, if father can't patronize, really, who can?
 
  Dylan, meanwhile, meets a fetching young stowaway, Elena (Mia Maestro), who is bunking with a waiter named Valentin (Freddy Rodriguez) in exchange for free passage. Richard Nelson (Dreyfuss) is traveling alone, having just been abandoned by his longtime lover — we learn that he is gay, dumped and loaded in a single swoop, as he orders a $5,000 bottle of wine for his business associates, whose diverse and duly shocked faces we never see again.
 
  Just before midnight, when travelers will cheerfully endure a pedantic but portentous toast to the god of the ocean delivered by Capt. Bradford (Andre Braugher), Dylan — who turns out to be a Navy veteran turned professional poker player — meets Robert at the poker table. (Kevin Dillon, as the drunk sexist in a ruffled tuxedo shirt therefore-he-must-die role, is also there.) He cleans up at the table, then bumps into 9-year-old Conor (Jimmy Bennett), channeling the role of Joey in "Airplane!", and his saucy single mom Maggie James (Jacinda Barrett).
 
  Little do the passengers know that, up in the control room, the chief officer is getting a funny feeling. A 150-foot high "rogue wave" (they exist, apparently, no matter how dubious their nomenclature) has appeared out of nowhere. There's not enough time even for a rushed scientific explanation at top volume before he and his crew are sent crashing into every available surface.
 
  The ship flips over in an instant, making a grisly tourist omelet of the revelers. Capt. Bradford assures the survivors that they'll be safe if they remain in the ballroom and wait for help, but Dylan, who is as roguish as the CGI wall of water that's turned their whole world upside down, decides to high-tail it to the hull. Jimmy asks to be taken along, and before Dylan knows it, he's shimmying up the center of the vessel followed by a smothering single mom, a precocious weird kid, a heartbroken gay architect, a stowaway, a waiter and Romeo and Juliet.
 
  What follows are tunnels, hatches and dead-ends, mostly. But what counts, as they say, is the journey, not the destination. In the few hours it takes to reach the outside, bonds are formed, and ... you know the drill. On the bright side, the action is tense and relentless, and attending a screening should obviate the need for a manicure. It's possible that some of the extended breath-holding it inspires is due to the extended underwater sequences, but you've got to take your adrenaline-boosting enjoyment where you can get it.
 
  Also, vast stores of know-how are discovered. I don't know what it is about disaster movies these days, but it seems you can't trap a group of lay people in an exploding death trap without watching them whip out all manner of latent engineering knowledge. It's impressive, especially to someone like me who can never remember which side of the car the gas tank is on. And it justifies the manly jumbo setting (upside-down, the cruise ship looks a lot like a U-boat), which, given the size of the group we're supposed to care about, could just as easily have been an overturned minivan. And that reminds me, isn't there something perverse and nihilistic about trapping a reveling herd in an over-decorated deathtrap while the cute and famous scramble to safety? I mean, it's just harder to care about Emmy Rossum's love problems after several thousand nameless victims have been wiped out in an instant.
 
  Still, it's one of "Poseidon's" few saving graces that the surviving cast members are drawn from lists further down the alphabet. A-listers' inherent right to survive before all others makes them harder to root for, I always find. It's the up-and-comers and stars in their waning years who know how to make a long, sweaty climb out of a sinking fireball feel relatable.

Nobody gets to decide whether to accept the mission in  Poseidon  or not; that's one of the many attractions of this excellently undemanding, swimmingly enjoyable remake of that perfectly glugging 1972 uh-oh classic, The Poseidon Adventure . No image-rehabilitating Cruise derring-do is expected from the partying cruise passengers whose lives are turned upside down. No exponentially clever twists of plot are expected by the partying audience either, except the inevitability that a few characters will perish and others will look good wet.
Wolfgang Petersen's Poseidon  delivers all  of this  it's a buoyant, old-wave disaster pic for a generation of well-conditioned thrill seekers charmed by the revelation that Richard Dreyfuss really is the Red Buttons of our day. Nice touch too: The ambivalent leader once played by Gene Hackman as a liberal minister who looks groovy with a comb-over is now played by Josh Lucas as a professional gambler who looks great in a tuxedo.
Anyhow, the whole notion of disaster preparedness has changed since back in the day when Shelley Winters showed off her underwater swimming skills as the Jewess with the best lungs this side of Beverly Sills. Back then, we really could believe there's got to be a morning after; rogue anythings weren't trained by al-Qaeda, and global warming wasn't a suspect in the catastrophic disruption of weather patterns. And wisely, the fellow who made Das Boot  and The Perfect Storm  runs a tight ship, aware that the remaking of a classic doesn't require the running time of Titanic .
Opening with a tour de force seamless shot that follows a jogger along the deck and up some stairs and up and up until the colossal scale of the doomed floating city comes into focus, Petersen, like Poseidon Adventure  director Ronald Neame before him, wastes no time in establishing bearings. The jogger is Lucas' Dylan Johns, and within 20 minutes, every other principal character is  accounted for, including the former firefighter and ex–NYC mayor Robert Ramsay (Kurt Russell, rolling two heroic 9/11 jobs into one), his lovely, stubborn daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), and her fresh-faced fiancé, Christian (Mike Vogel); the gay architect (Dreyfuss) nursing a broken heart; the single mom (Ladder 49 's Jacinda Barrett) with the spunky kid (Jimmy Bennett); the good-hearted Hispanic waiter (Six Feet Under 's Freddy  Rodriguez) and his stowaway friend (Mia Maestro); the ship's captain (Andre Braugher); and, uh, Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas  I mean, Stacy Ferguson  playing a shipboard chanteuse. Oh, and Kevin Dillon playing Entourage 's Johnny ''Drama'' playing a jerk who calls himself Lucky Larry.
Them's the players. Minutes later, the great New Year's Eve heave is under way. One moment, some worried chap in the control room is saying, ''Do you feel that? Something's off.'' And the next moment, it's ''No! No!'' while we, of course, cheer, Yes, yes! First the water. Then, the fires (flash, fireball, long-burning  your choice), followed by the electrocutions, impalings, charrings, drownings, crushings of the faceless many, both in the ballroom (where the fancy older folks flounder) and the disco (where Jen and Chris reunite, sooty but alive). Quickly, there's a sorting out of who's in for the longer haul, and the demonstration of various skills and fears. ''I used to be a fireman. He's gonna be okay,'' the former mayor assures one panicked citizen, while Elena (Maestro) displays the prayerfulness of an observant Catholic  and the panic of a lady with acute claustrophobia. Dreyfuss' architect, meanwhile, proves to be patient,  comforting, and brave. And in his lovely portrayal, the actor holds the center of every scene he's in.  And then: It's all about the escape, stupid.
Nothing exactly replicates the original, but then nothing is exactly different either  in a good way. Some routes out of the hull are successful  forged by Dylan (who doesn't want any followers, but who also can't resist a pretty mom and chirpy kid) and by Ramsay (who vies for alpha male status with the younger man, Russell's steely manner contrasted with Lucas' more improvisatory blue-eyed charm). Other routes go terribly wrong. Working from a script by The Cell 's Mark Protosevich, with lots of notes, no doubt, from many producers, including Sheila Allen, widow of original producer Irwin Allen, Petersen knows when to pause for detail (Elena's necklace cross, for instance, makes a crucial screwdriver) before barreling full steam ahead. Less than a hundred minutes later, some folks are saved. Others aren't. Life should only be so simple.

 IT'S hard to think of a big-budget Hollywood picture with less reason for existing than "Poseidon," Wolfgang Petersen's remake of "The Poseidon Adventure," Ronald Neame's much-derided, much-beloved 1972 disaster-kitsch classic based on a Paul Gallico novel. Well, maybe "Mission: Impossible III." And, for that matter, "RV," "Failure to Launch," "Rumor Has it," "The Pink Panther," "Bewitched," "The Dukes of Hazzard," and ... you know what? Just forget I said anything.  Anyway, Mr. Petersen's "Poseidon" is unlikely to replace the original in the hearts of action-hungry moviegoers, though it will probably expunge the memory of the earlier, made-for-TV remake (and also, perhaps, of the 1979 sequel, "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure"). The hard-working cast does a lot of screaming, climbing and death-defying in soaking-wet evening wear, but they can hardly hope to match the ripe absurdity of Shelley Winters, Red Buttons and — in one of the great plug-ugly he-man overacting contests ever committed to celluloid — Gene Hackman and Ernest Borgnine.  Oh, well. The original, like other specimens of its period and genre, mixed dinner-theater histrionics with stunts and explosions, rising to a campy, earnest grandeur that today's technology-driven, committee-made products rarely attempt, let alone achieve.  That said, Mr. Petersen is pretty good at digital and mechanical showmanship, as well as something of a specialist in maritime distress, having made his name with "Das Boot" 25 years ago and returned to the sea in 2000 with "The Perfect Storm." Accordingly, he approaches "Poseidon" as a series of problems in applied physics, subjecting various liquids and solids to a series of extreme thermodynamic and gravitational tests.  A good deal of seat-of-the-pants engineering savvy is also required of the characters in the film, who must respond to a disaster that strikes their cruise ship in the early hours of the new year, right after toasts have been made, songs sung (by Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas) and expository dialogue delivered.  In due course we meet the designated survivors (though in some cases the designation will of course be temporary). Kurt Russell plays Robert Ramsey, a protective dad whose daughter, Jennifer (Emmy Rossum), is on board with her boyfriend, Christian (Mike Vogel). Robert's foil — the Borgnine to his Hackman, or the reverse — is Dylan Johns (Josh Lucas), a professional gambler who was once  in the Navy.  We learn that last, hardly irrelevant fact in between explosions, cries of distress and feats of breath-holding, which is how we discover all kinds of other interesting information: for example, about the arrangement that led Elena (Mia Maestro) to board the ship as a stowaway, and about Robert Ramsey's precruise career. Apparently he was not only a heroic firefighter, but also, "for a while," the mayor of New York City. Mostly, though, the dialogue in Mike Protosevich's script consists of shouted practicalities: "I got a vertical shaft about 10 yards ahead!" "That's got to be the propeller tube!" "It's our only option!" "Let's go!" "Gotta keep moving!"  And the chief virtue of "Poseidon" is that it does. The picture conducts its business in an unprepossessing 100 minutes. The ship capsizes, thanks to a "rogue wave," at around minute 15, leaving the captain (Andre Braugher) a moment or two in which to look noble and give Fergie a farewell hug before the flipped-over ballroom is inundated, much as it was 34 years ago.    Meanwhile Dylan, determined to save his own skin, becomes the reluctant leader of a scrappy band that includes, in addition to those already mentioned, a waiter named Valentin (Freddy Rodríguez), who has sheltered Elena, and Nelson (Richard Dreyfuss), an architect, whose heartbroken suicide attempt was interrupted by that  wave. Let's not forget Molly (Jacinda Barrett), who has had a moment of flirtation with Dylan, and her young son, Conor (Jimmy Bennett), an imperiled child being obligatory in a movie of this kind. (In Hollywood I believe this is known as the Dakota Fanning clause.)  But I almost did forget Kevin Dillon, playing a creep  who goes by the name of Lucky Larry. "You don't just get the nickname Lucky Larry," this fellow observes, swigging booze from a hip flask as he prepares to cross a narrow catwalk over a pool of flaming oil. "You gotta be lucky!" Gee, I wonder if he'll make it back to dry land, or even across that burning fuel. I also wonder if the black and Hispanic characters will outlive their white counterparts, or if the winner of an Oscar for best actor will give his life to save a mere SAG award winner for a supporting role on television.  Actually, I don't wonder, and you won't either. "Poseidon," intermittently concerned with blueprints and floor plans, is pretty much pure boilerplate: a reasonably well-executed throwaway that, when you finally get around to seeing it in its proper setting, will make you glad you decided to travel by air instead of by sea.  "Poseidon" is rated PG-13. Many dead bodies are displayed, but the survivors keep their clothes on and their language clean.

The stripped-down title of the disaster epic formerly known as "The Poseidon Adventure" accurately reflects the movie itself -- an early-summer vehicle that's built for speed, with scant time to develop characters before the world turns upside-down. Thanks to its simple construction, Wolfgang Petersen's large-scale liner moves reasonably well, though anyone with the faintest memory of its 1972 predecessor will wonder where most of the plot went, and the dialogue is so stilted it can honestly be said the less the better. Given that, Warner Bros. should enjoy a few bright mornings after, though prospects of an extended theatrical voyage appear unlikely.
Petersen came to prominence directing another sea-faring tale, "Das Boot," but beyond the waves the two films are polar opposites -- one exploring human nature under claustrophobic conditions, the other basically using its actors as props in a video-game style ascent to survival.
It's equally telling that when the producers "started from scratch with an all-new screenplay and original, contemporary characters," as Petersen explains in the production notes, the demography of that hardy band changed considerably. And while Richard Dreyfuss plays a gay architect, which can be seen as a nod to a new century, there's no room anymore for Shelley Winters' fat old Mrs. Rosen; instead, the three central females -- Jacinda Barrett, Emmy Rossum and Mia Maestro -- all look pretty fabulous when wet.
Written by Mark Protosevich, "Poseidon" dispenses with its exposition in the first 20 minutes, and even then, as sparingly as possible. Dylan (Josh Lucas) is a ne'er-do-well gambler, first seen in a high-stakes poker game opposite Robert (Kurt Russell), who is -- for no particular reason -- the former mayor of New York.
Robert is traveling with his headstrong daughter (Rossum) and her boyfriend (Mike Vogel), a relationship Robert isn't thrilled about. Dylan, meanwhile, engages in a brief flirtation with a single mom (Barrett) who has brought along her young son, whereas Elena (Maestro) has stowed away, having lacked the passage for a trip to see her ailing brother in New York.
That's about as much as the audience learns before the wave hits, leaving the special effects, in essence, as the star of the story. And while there are some impressive, harrowing sequences as passengers get picked off by an almost biblical parade of threats, the initial impact of that great "rogue wave" is over in a matter of moments, and some of the imagery is too conspicuously computer generated, diminishing its impact.
As the aspiring Moses attempting to lead his people to the promised land (minus the priestly vestments cloaked on Gene Hackman), Lucas cuts a dashing figure, and the male bonding between him and Russell brings almost the only sparks that fly character-wise.
At least Dreyfuss' efforts to assist "Alias" co-star Maestro are perfectly chaste in this telling, as opposed to Red Buttons' dragging a well-soaked Carol Lynley along behind him.
From a practical standpoint, the movie's truncated running time will doubtless come as a pleasant surprise to some, not only allowing theaters to squeeze in extra showings but sparing teens the ordeal of sitting through mushy emotion before things start blowing up. And despite the liberties taken, this version is preferable to Hallmark's recent made-for-TV update, which absurdly revised the story so that terrorists triggered a blast that tipped the boat over.
Indeed, after a spate of overly long blockbusters from Petersen, including "Troy," just the fact that he brings one home in less than 100 minutes represents an interesting twist. Still, even if the goal was to test whether audiences will warm to a disaster yarn that barely bothers to identify its victims, "Poseidon" goes a little overboard.

Our anemic movie industry recycles so relentlessly that even complaints about micro-remilling and plasticized repackaging are themselves recycled product, offered to draw the line between concerned aging cinephiles and the target consumers who don't care a whit. But still, we've become a culture not merely tantalized by but doped on never ending resurrections of our own recent junk. The market dynamic seems to be accelerating, and perhaps there'll be a cyclical point when the diminishing returns will vanish altogether, and the punk-like essence of moviespeople, stories, experience, visual insightmay rise up. Or not.
That no one is going to the mat for the old Poseidon Adventure  is beside the point; the inaugural disaster film was old-fashioned cheesecake, but it was still the '70s, so the actors (even ostensible hottie Carol Lynley ) looked like real people; the catastrophe at hand was entirely a matter of sets, stunts, real fire, and gravity; and the characters weren't hyper-formulated with motivational backstories and toddler-simple hero-villain identities. The new Poseidon being an utterly empty-skulled genre mechanism and nothing more begins in digital fourth gear, swooping up, over, and around the animated ship with faux helicopter-ness, catching glimpses of a jogging Josh Lucas , all in one shot!  Except we know it's notit's merely a tired series of CGI sutures and gimcracks. But it's in the brutally obvious intro scenes to the B-list cast where Wolfgang Petersen 's movie truly begins to reveal itself. Instead of Gene Hackman 's bizarrely Nietzschean priest, we get Lucas as a career gambler with a mercenary sense of survival and lots of helpful navy experience as a cliff diver; Kurt Russell  is his counterpoint, an exNew York mayor ("Cool!" someone says in mid-flight-for-life) and, also luckily, a retired fireman. His daughter (the at times intolerably dewy Emmy Rossum ) is stumping for her boyfriend (Mike Vogel ) and even shows Daddy the secret engagement ring right before they slide down a firehose over a lake of fire.
Richard Dreyfuss , as a heartbroken gay millionaire who is literally climbing over the rail in a suicidal lurch when the monster wave appears, proves to be mostly an impediment in the trip through the capsized vessel, but no more so than a handful of other lackluster souls. (Fergie , of the Black Eyed Peas , is the ballroom chanteuse not  singing "The Morning After.") Old peoplethe linchpin of every cruise ship passenger listare now absent; when it comes down to a sacrificial rescue underwater, Russell is  Shelley Winters .
Still, nobody is able to act in any way even James Lipton  could praise; Petersen's movie moves perhaps too quickly, so conversations are reduced to Stone Age quips. Kevin Dillon 's caricatured asswipe is sub jected to one of the most deplorable deserving-death setups ever concocted, trying to pick a drunken fistfight within minutes of the boat turning over. (How I missed Ernest Borgnine 's Rogo the fat cop, reflexively resisting Hackman's messianic leader and evoking every grouchy, work-hardened friend's uncle I'd ever met as a kid.) It is telling, in the blitz of blustery destruction and expense, that the most pungent sequence is set in an air duct, where all of the characters are crammed and the serious claustrophobia of Mexican stowaway Mia Maestro  becomes a distinctly nasty crucible.
Poseidon  may, like Spielberg's War of the Worlds , go down better outside of the metro area than within. A supposedly fun thing I may never want to do again after 9-11, disaster films are simple death porn, and the easy wow factor of fireballs, massive explosions, flying bodies, and architectural obliteration on a large scale is, or should be, no longer a gimme. Petersen's film doesn't avert its gaze from the corpses and mayhem like the original, relatively speaking, didas if to, what, chasten us for ever enjoying the genre? Or has 9-11, in Hollywood 's eyes, been converted to a kind of combat seasoning, after which we should not only tolerate experiences of bloody catastrophe but thrill to them? Did it take 9-11 to turn us en masse into the wreck-wound junkies of J.G. Ballard 's Crash ? I missed the inoculation, I guess, and do not look forward to the remake of The Towering Inferno .
