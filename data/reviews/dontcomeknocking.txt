         "Don't Come Knocking" opens with a bandit mask view of blue sky and fluffy white clouds where the eyes should be. A reverse shot reveals it to be a panoramic vista of rocks near Moab, Utah, with Sam Shepard on horseback high-tailing it from somewhere or another.
 
  We quickly learn he's a washed-up movie star named Howard Spence who has gone AWOL from the set of a western in which he is starring. A 60-year-old drug- and alcohol-abusing playboy, Howard heads for home in Elko, Nev., a place he hasn't been in 30 years.
 


         






    The film marks the reunion of screenwriter Shepard and director Wim Wenders, whose earlier collaboration, "Paris, Texas," won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1984. Though "Don't Come Knocking" revels in themes both men have had success with, its narrative kinks and improbabilities reduce it to an unsatisfying allegory. Despite a fine cast, the film feels as lost as Howard, unsure of its direction or tone.
 
  Howard's departure leaves the film set in turmoil, its director (George Kennedy) frustrated and its female lead (Marley Shelton) unable to perform with a stand-in. A no-nonsense representative of the bond company, Sutter (Tim Roth), swoops in by helicopter and begins tracking the wayward cowboy.
 
  In Elko, Howard's reunion with his elderly mother (Eva Marie Saint) is cut short by the revelation that he has a twentysomething son from a long-ago encounter on a film shoot in Butte, Mont. He heads off in his late father's Packard, unsure of what's ahead.
 
  Meanwhile, a young woman named Sky (Sarah Polley) arrives in Butte carrying an urn with her recently deceased mother's ashes. Howard and Sky intersect at the restaurant run by Howard's old flame, Doreen (Jessica Lange), who seems more bemused than anything to see her long-gone lover. Earl (Gabriel Mann), Howard and Doreen's moody musician son, is not eager to embrace his father, and the film becomes a roundelay of awkward offers and refusals of rapprochement.
 
  Butte may well give the performance of the movie, upstaging the more cinematically familiar Utah desert. The town's deserted streets look both beautiful and haunted — nicely rendered by cinematographer Franz Lustig — and feed Wenders' fondness for an American West etched with loneliness.
 
  The angelic Polley moves through the film with beatific grace, gently guiding the other characters toward a conclusion. As frustrating and elliptical as the film's first half is, there an abstract peace that settles in by its end. Unfortunately, the mystery that engulfs Shepard's best plays, imbuing his dysfunctional families with a sense of drama and tragedy, is missing here.
 
 'Don't Come Knocking'
 
 MPAA rating:
 R for language and brief nudity   

Sam Shepard, with his snaggle-toothed rawhide glamour, is just about the only actor of his generation who can still wear a cowboy hat that looks as though it utterly belongs on his grizzled head. In Don't Come Knocking , which he wrote and stars in, and which Wim Wenders directed with his usual flaky but open-eyed here-and-there ramble, Shepard plays an aging Hollywood bad boy who was once a big Western star. His glory days are 25 years behind him, which vagues out the film's cultural time frame a bit; after all, it's not as if they were making vintage horse operas in the mid-'70s. Nevertheless, Shepard's charisma has always reached back to an earlier time, so it's easy to accept him as a kind of pre-counterculture hero  Eastwood without the sneer  who aged into the era of tabloid scandal.
When we first meet him, he's riding a horse through the rocky plains of Utah, but what looks like a joyful gallop is really an escape: Shepard's character, Howard Spence, has ditched a movie set, leaving the production he's starring in high and dry. A quick glimpse into his trailer  liquor bottles, smears of cocaine, slinky groupies  tells us most of what we need to know about Howard's lifestyle. A little later, he flips through a scrapbook of infamy: affairs, fights, drug and alcohol busts splashed over years of headlines. Don't Come Knocking  is a tale of redemption, and much of it passes by in that wandering Wenders haze, but what gives it a vital, touching dimension is that Shepard, as actor and writer, depicts Howard's burnout from a hard-bitten inside knowledge of celebrity's privileges and traps. Howard is a man so used to not giving that he's dried himself up. He learns, early on, that he has a son he never knew about, the product of a love affair with a waitress (Jessica Lange) that took place when he was making a film in Butte, Mont., decades before. He arrives in Butte with a half-hearted inclination to connect with his past, and maybe with himself. Don't Come Knocking  bears a surface resemblance to Broken Flowers , but this movie is soaked in regret. Howard, by looking into the eyes of his son (Gabriel Mann), who has no particular interest in his deadbeat famous father, touches something essential: the life he should have led but couldn't.

 A magnificent ruin: that's how the American West is pictured in "Don't Come Knocking," a surreal epic-manqué that reunites the playwright and screenwriter Sam Shepard with the great German director Wim Wenders more than two decades after their auspicious 1984 collaboration, "Paris, Texas."  That description also applies to the visually majestic but dramatically inert new movie they've made together, and to the ravaged but still-handsome face of its 60-something writer and star. As impassive and craggy as a granite monument, Mr. Shepard has physically aged into a symbol of the stubborn, cranky individualist who has been a constant presence in his plays and films. Nowadays, he merely has to squint into the camera to suggest a tired, suspicious cowboy who has spent decades riding the range, roping steers and peering into the horizon for signs of trouble.  Mr. Shepard did not star in "Paris, Texas" (Harry Dean Stanton stood in for him), but in "Don't Come Knocking" he is everywhere and nowhere at once playing Howard Spence, a burnt-out star (a Clint Eastwood type) who flees the Utah set of his latest picture to embark on a rambling exploration of his past. Howard has spent a lifetime boozing, drugging, brawling and womanizing, and it shows  Video: Movie Minutes Stephen Holden reviews "Don't Come Knocking," a surreal epic-manque that reunites the playwright and screenwriter Sam Shepard with the great German director Wim Wenders.  The first leg of Howard's odyssey takes him from the desert movie set to the Elko, Nev., home of his mother (Eva Marie Saint), whom he hasn't visited in 30 years. When she jolts him with the news that a woman from Butte, Mont., once contacted her saying she had borne him a son, he impulsively decides to drive to Montana.  In Butte, depicted as a shabby former boomtown whose streets are nearly empty, Howard meets his fly-by-night former lover, Doreen (Jessica Lange), who owns and operates a local bar. He also encounters the grownup son he knew nothing about until a day or two earlier. That son, Earl (Gabriel Mann), is a bitter, hotheaded musician who is so unsettled by his father's sudden entrance into his life that he goes ballistic and tosses all his possessions out the window.  Howard also meets a second child, Sky (Sarah Polley), his daughter by an unidentified woman whose ashes Sky carries around with her in an urn. The character is so sketchy (and ultimately unnecessary) that she seems to have been tossed into the movie as an afterthought.  "Don't Come Knocking" tantalizes us with ghosts and mysteries and the promise of psychic adventure until Howard reaches Butte, whereupon the movie grinds to a halt, mired in the mud of unsettled family business. From there it hems and haws, spinning its wheels trying to work up enough momentum to go somewhere, but it never budges  During his journey, Howard is trailed by Sutter (Tim Roth), a poker-faced insurance investigator determined to drag him back to Utah to fulfill his contract. In this metaphoric chase, Howard is an outlaw who must literally be brought back in handcuffs by a city-slicker sheriff. But Mr. Roth's Sutter, like Ms. Polley's Sky, is a one-dimensional projection that has no life beyond a stick-figure representation.  For all the nuance Ms. Saint pours into her portrayal of Howard's mother, her role is also more symbolic than real; mothers, in Mr. Shepard's world, may scold their errant sons, but always protect and forgive, and cook them breakfast, before sending them on their way. Ms. Lange's Doreen spits fire, but the actress can't sort through her character's sudden changes of attitude, and because the upper half of Ms. Lange's face appears immobilized by cosmetic work, she is only able to give half a performance.  Yet there is much to admire in "Don't Come Knocking." Mr. Wenders and the cinematographer, Franz Lustig, fill the screen with pictures whose shimmering, mirage-like intensity reflects the name of Howard's movie-in-progress, "Phantom of the West." For "Don't Come Knocking" is finally a meditation on cultural ectoplasm, on phantom cowboys and outlaws and the potent myths surrounding them. To Howard, fatherhood is just as ectoplasmic, until he confronts its reality, and even then he is dumbstruck. It's far easier for the western loner to skip town and never look back. When Sutter retrieves the rebel star, Howard appears relieved.  "Don't Come Knocking" is filled with haunting visual panoramas. One of the most resonant is a nighttime shot of the Elko skyline dominated by a glittering casino. Evoking a once and future gold rush, it says more about the Old West and the New West than all of Mr. Shepard's elliptical, stagy dialogue can muster. Such powerful images make "Don't Come Knocking" well worth contemplating.  "Don't Come Knocking" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity.
We've all done itkilled an afternoon drinking in a pleasantly grungy roadhouse somewhere, boozily enjoying the illusion of having fallen off the grid, playing semi-forgotten blues songs on an outdated jukebox and saying to oneself, see, I should capture this feeling, this should be a movie . Sobered up, we don't make that movie, but Wim Wenders  does. Having begun as the most austerely hip of the German New Wavers, Wenders quickly became besotted with American cliché culture, from trench-coat noir and road-movie outlawry to rockabilly and post-western macho-ness, all of it commonly orchestrated with a whiskeyhead's dreary notion of cool and lousy sense of direction. In the last quarter-century, he blazed with propulsive originality twicein 1984's Paris, Texas  , which played to all of Wenders's touristy weaknesses and still emerged as a cohesive miracle, and Wings of Desire  (1987), a sui generis, all-German masterpiece he has tried and failed to regenerate since. But otherwise, Wenders has been lost in his funhouse, and a crash festival of Faraway, So Close! , The End of Violence , The Million Dollar Hotel  , Land of Plenty, and the new Don't Come Knocking  would cure even Tom Waits  of barroom whimsy for life.
Given such a run, you might suggest a return to the wellspring of his better films, script-wise, and that is what Wenders has done: Don't Come Knocking  was written by Sam Shepard , but unlike Paris, Texas  the project meanders through predictable and emotionally undemanding territory, with Shepard himself grumping up center stage as a menopausal jerk searching for meaning we're never sure is there. Shepard's hero, a leathery cowboy actor named Howard Spence , defects from a desert movie set (shooting what looks like an anachronistic Fordian oater) and his blind-driving lifestyle of booze, dope, and fan-boffing. With a bond company agent (Tim Roth ) on his tail, the uncommunicative and vaguely motivated Spence heads to his mother's house in Nevada , where despite the warm, practical presence of Eva Marie Saint  he finds no solacefeel the momentum!but does discover, as if you didn't see it coming, that a waitress he knocked up more than two decades earlier had a son he's never met. It's Broken Flowers  with bourbon and ten-gallons and meta-country soundtrack warbles.
So, on to Butte  (in a vintage Olds, no less), where the strangely stiff-faced barmaid (Jessica Lange ) gives him a hard time, his new-wave-Elvis-ish, Chris Isaak toned club singer son (Gabriel Mann ) spits in his eye, and a nurturing young woman (Sarah Polley ) who carries an urn of her mother's ashes everywhere (she talks to it, like Warren Oates  growling at Alfredo Garcia 's severed head) suggests that she's his kid too. We've got an hour or so left, as Spence pleads with virtually everyone to give him some kind of chance, before he more or less surrenders to inertia in the movie's most stirring sequence: On an abandoned couch on a dead-end street, Spence sits still for what passes for 24 hours, as the low-rent neighborhood around him flits by, dogs keep him company, and Wenders's camera indulges in a slow series of circular pans.
That's it for early-Shepardian set pieces. What all this has to do with moviemaking, stardom, substance abuse, paternity, middle age, Montana , or America, I could not say. Wenders clearly doesn't think in those terms; he longs to make narrative choices the way a jazz guitarist chooses licks, capriciously, hunting for grooviness. But the attempt imbues his movies with the personality of a hungover Beat poet playing dress-up.
