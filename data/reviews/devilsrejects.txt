Any film that reunites Rock 'n� Roll High School
 alumnus Riff Randall (Soles) and Principal Togar (Woronov) is aces and eights in my book, but Rob Zombie�s follow-up to his disappointing debut, House of 1,000 Corpses
, does more than just exhume a morgue full of genre favorites � it�s also the year�s most viciously entertaining psycho-road-movie-revenge-'n�-wreckage-romance. If that last hyphenate doesn�t tip you off that this warped rechristening of American Family Values isn�t for the squeamish, nothing will, so I�ll bite my tongue off and chew the fatted calves of Leslie Easterbrook, here seen channeling something akin to Gena Rowlands on mad, bad biker speed while William Forsythe gives us a remarkably accurate Warren Oates. What�s not to love? Zombie�s 2003 outing, helmed after handling directing duties on a number of White Zombie videos, was a scattershot take on Tobe Hooper�s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre
 that never quite gelled into a cohesive shocker despite some winning grue and a bizarrely wacky turn by former Spider Baby
 Sid Haig as the Marx Brothers-loving killer clown Captain Spaulding. Haig and the Captain are back for this semi-sequel, which reunites the greasepainted schnorrer
 with his lunatic brood, including wife Mother Firefly (Easterbrook), daughter Baby (Moon Zombie), and son Otis P. Firefly (Moseley, "Chop Top" of Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2
). This time out they take it on the lam as Forsythe�s rogue Sheriff Wydell, seeking revenge for the death of his brother in House
, stalks them at every turn, operating in and out of the legal parameters with enough savagely righteous glee to render him both a worthy nemesis for this murderously perverse band of outsiders and, ultimately, a force for good twisted horrifically asunder. That Zombie�s decidedly un-P.C. film makes the Firefly clan as borderline sympathetic as it does is something of an accomplishment in and of itself and echoes The Devil�s Rejects
 most obvious antecedent, Wes Craven�s sly class-war horror show The Hills Have Eyes
. But Zombie, who gets top-notch performances from virtually his entire cast � including former Craven-iac Berryman � has as much if not more on his mind, and his film benefits immensely from not only being truly nightmarish and disturbing, but also being laugh-out-loud subversive. It�s got to be some sort of Cinema of Transgression high-water mark to find yourself chuckling away at Zombie�s wittily profane dialogue and relentless forward motion even  as the Manson-esque offspring commit motel-room atrocities that�d have Norman Bates shrieking like a little girl. The Devil�s Rejects
 fairly spurts off the screen like blood from a freshly lacerated jugular, rarely pausing for breath (except, of course, to linger lovingly over some obscene new act of random violence) until the film�s final moments, well calculated to make Sam Peckinpah grin in his grave. You can already hear the clamor of the politically correct calling for Zombie�s film to be banned, but if you watch closely, you�ll see that The Devil�s Rejects
 isn�t so much celebrating the act of violence as it is paying heartfelt homage
 to the high-grain, Seventies-era bouquet of cinematic sleaze (as well as that decade�s most loved/loathed classic rock ditties; you�ll never listen to "Free Bird" quite the same way again). And speaking of impending backlash, if the first half-decade of the new millennium has taught us anything, it�s that the human race is more abysmally mired in real-life ferocity and bloodlust than ever before, so perhaps viewing Zombie�s Super-16 death trip as both a snarky commentary on the American zeitgeist and an ode to hell-bound debauchery is right on the blood-money after all. If for some reason you feel the need to see a real
 atrocity exhibition, go turn on CNN. As the old tagline for Craven�s Last House on the Left
 so accurately put it, this is "Only a movie ... only a movie ... only a movie."


Rob Zombie, the erstwhile heavy-metal rocker and pride of Haverhill, Mass., has just released his second big-screen venture, following 2003's critically nuked ''House of 1,000 Corpses." Titled ''The Devil's Rejects," this sort-of sequel follows three sadistic killers as they cut a swath through the mid-1970s Midwest. It is a proudly sick film of no social value whatsoever, and all right-thinking moviegoers will properly shun it as a pox upon their multiplex.
Everyone else might want to check it out.
Steeped deeply and knowledgeably in the trash aesthetic of Roger Corman B-films and Combat Zone grindhouse fare like ''I Spit on Your Grave," ''Devil's Rejects" is a blood-smeared and almost completely scurrilous love letter to anyone who ever appeared in the junk movies of the '60s through '80s. This extends to the casting
 of anyone who ever appeared in the junk movies of the '60s through '80s.
True, of the psychotic central trio, only Sid Haig as the clown-faced Captain Spaulding has bona fide psychotronic street cred (he costarred in the 1968 cult classic ''Spider Baby"). Sheri Moon, as his pneumatic daughter Baby, is better known as Mrs. Rob Zombie, and Bill Moseley, as their testy, Manson-esque partner in crime, Otis B. Driftwood, has only been around since the late '80s.
(Yes, they're named after Groucho Marx characters. Rob Zombie, it turns out, has a thing for Marx Brothers movies as well, and he really
 loves cheesy mid-'70s rock songs such as Elvin Bishop's ''Fooled Around and Fell in Love" and David Essex's ''Rock On." No one has ever combined drive-in sleaze, references to classic comedy teams, and the oeuvre of Lynyrd Skynyrd before, in large part because no one has considered it a remotely good idea.)
As the Spauldings tear across the desert, with Sheriff John Wydell (William Forsythe) the designated hellhound on their trail, each of their gore-spattered encounters contains a cameo designed to make late-night cable aficionados sit bolt upright in disbelief. There's Mary Woronov (ex-Warhol Factory regular and Miss Togar of ''Rock 'n' Roll High School") as a doomed nurse! There's Steve Railsback (the title character of ''The Stunt Man") as a state cop! There's E.G. Daily, Dottie from ''Pee-wee's Big Adventure," as a hooker! Leslie Easterbrook (the ''Police Academy" series) as the foulmouthed Mother Firefly, Ken Foree (''From Beyond") as a bordello proprietor, tough guy Danny Trejo as a bounty hunter, ''The Hills Have Eyes" oddity Michael Berryman as an . . . oddity! There's even P.J. Soles, of ''Halloween" and ''Stripes" and ''Rock 'n' Roll High School," as a threatened mom.
P.J. Soles
, ladies and gentlemen! This isn't a cast, it's a class reunion.
Maybe none of this means anything to you. Maybe seeing a chunky mid-50s woman who was once the most delightful young actress in the kind of movies that never got any critical respect just doesn't float your boat. But it's enough to make some of us weep with nostalgia.
When we're not flinching. Zombie also resuscitates the unregenerate sadism of his beloved cinematic crud, and the long central section of ''Rejects," in which the villains kidnap and torture a family of country musicians led by Geoffrey Lewis and Priscilla ''Three's Company" Barnes, is just plain mean -- overdirected exploitation grunge catering to our inner rubbernecker. True, it's refreshing to find a director who doesn't pull punches, and ostensibly this is to make us loathe the Captain and his confreres all the more, softening us up for the sheriff's climactic vigilante vengeance.
But that's just a shell game. Zombie loves his drive-in killers and he wants us to love them, too -- they're uninhibited über-slobs, following their homicidal whims without acknowledging other people as anything besides targets or playthings. They're free -- in a cretinous sort of way -- and ''Devil's Rejects" lets them go out in a blaze of glory that echoes both ''Bonnie and Clyde" and ''Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."
Sorry, doesn't wash, even with ''Free Bird" yowling triumphantly on the soundtrack. With ''The Devil's Rejects," Rob Zombie proves he's a filmmaker to be taken seriously -- or at least not to be considered a total joke -- but he still hasn't figured out how to fashion something more than the sum of his enthusiasms. He has an eight-track tape in place of a soul, and it keeps switching sides just as you're starting to get your groove on.



Working his way through the Z-movie pantheon of '70s exploitation subgenres, rocker-filmmaker Rob Zombie transitions from house of horrors homage to serial killer road movie with this crass, vacuous exercise in grind-house stylistics.
 
  As in his 2003 feature debut, "House of 1000 Corpses," the director borrows from numerous films, embellishing them with his own bizarre sense of deluded grandeur.
 
    Though the genre-hopping director maintains that this is not a sequel, "The Devil's Rejects" does continue the exploits of the psychopath stars from the first movie, the Firefly family, whose members are inexplicably named for Groucho Marx characters.
 
  From the stylized freeze-frames that end most sequences to the overly familiar climax that references so many films there should be footnotes, "Rejects" feels like 100% regurgitation, minus whatever protein that may have existed in the originals.

 "The Devil's Rejects," 
Rated R. Running time: 1 hour, 41 minutes. General release.

Rob Zombie, the founder and lead savage of White Zombie, isn't the first rock star to direct a horror movie (let us all pause for a moment to forget Dee Snider's Strangeland ), but he's the first to put his pierced-punk death-metal demon credo right up on screen, turning horror into a depraved rock & roll blood feast. In The Devil's Rejects , Zombie's second effort as a grade-Z-and-lovin'-it auteur (the first was 2003's House of 1000 Corpses ), he directs like someone who has spent far too much time soaking up the most psychotic images of violence he can find: Chainsaw  (natch) and Cannibal Holocaust,  Manson docs and Faces of Death  videos, Natural Born Killers  and I Spit on Your Grave .
The Devil's Rejects , a wild-ass road movie of down-home slaughter, recalls many other tales of homicidal sadists in the rocky American Southwest. The difference is that Zombie doesn't pretend to be on the side of the victims. He makes no bones about his identification with the sexy outlaw serial killers, a brother and sister played by the hippieish Bill Moseley and the Marilyn Chambers-like Sheri Moon Zombie (the director's wife), who commit many squalid and hideous acts, terrorizing their victims with knives, axes, and shotguns, all in the name of sociopathic cool. They're the movie's ''rock stars'' incarnate. Zombie's characters are, to put it mildly, undeveloped (he features two kinds of women: sexy young sluts and beat-up old whores), but there's no denying the leeringly grotesque egghead-devil  charisma of Sid Haig, who returns from House of 1000 Corpses  as Captain Spaulding, the clown so ugly you forgot to laugh.

 Two years after his feature film debut with the cult horror hit "House of 1,000 Corpses," the heavy-metal musician Rob Zombie, founder and lead singer of the band White Zombie, continues his experiment in art-house schlock with this second installment of the adventures of the murderous Firefly family.  "The Devil's Rejects" opens with a police raid on a decaying farmhouse somewhere in the South. After a bloody shootout culminating in the capture of Mother Firefly (Leslie Easterbrook), the only escapees are Otis (Bill Moseley) and his sister Baby (Sheri Moon Zombie, the director's real-life wife). These two sadistic siblings hit the road, eventually hooking up with their father, a deranged clown known only as Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig).  The three flee to a roadside motel and, later, to a brothel run by Captain Spaulding's pal Charlie (Ken Foree). Along the way, the Fireflies find time to pursue their favorite hobby: torturing and killing innocent bystanders in elaborately cruel ways. But they finally meet their match in Sheriff John Wydell (William Forsythe), a renegade lawman intent on seeking vengeance for the long-ago murder of his brother at the hands of the Firefly clan.  Despite its nearly nonstop torrent of gore, "The Devil's Rejects" is not really a horror film. It's a compendium of tributes and references to horror films of the past, as well as to Sergio Leone westerns and 70's road pictures like "Bonnie and Clyde." Mr. Zombie's love for, and encyclopedic knowledge of, the exploitation genre is evident in every detail, down to the Super-16 film stock he's chosen to give this film the grainy texture and washed-out color palette of a drive-in B-movie.  "The Devil's Rejects" is a trompe l'oeil experiment in deliberately retro filmmaking. It looks sensational, but there is a curious emptiness at its core. The director seems uncertain whether we should root for his gleefully evil protagonists or their righteous avenger, Sheriff Wydell (played by Mr. Forsythe with grimly unironic intensity). Because the film's mood shifts so quickly from playful perversity to primal dread, and because the Firefly family's wickedness seems unmotivated by anything but pure caprice, "The Devil's Rejects" soon devolves into a tedious moral muddle: Who's good? Who's evil? Who cares?  The film ends with a climactic coda straight out of a Sam Peckinpah film, in which the beleaguered Fireflies drive straight into a police trap, all guns blazing, to the strains of the Lynyrd Skynyrd rock anthem "Free Bird." If the film had earned its stripes by making us care about the characters, this could have been a gloriously satisfying (if hopelessly corny) ending. Instead, like much of the rest of "The Devil's Rejects," the meticulously staged final shootout is a triumph of style alone.  "The Devil's Rejects" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sadistic violence, strong sexual content, strong language and drug use.

Heavy-metal rocker-turned-cult filmmaker Rob Zombie has fashioned another bloody grind house valentine in "The Devil's Rejects." Recycling the trio of butchers from his 2003 surprise hit "House of 1000 Corpses," pic is a brutal, punishing yet mordantly amusing work that far outpaces its predecessor in its grisly single-mindedness of vision. If you can stomach the violence -- and despite the R rating, that's a big if -- it's hard to deny that Zombie has made exactly the movie he set out to make, guaranteed to satiate his considerable fan base and sicken just about everyone else.
Where "House" came across as little more than a ghoulish curio, set in an outre Texas deathtrap and steeped in arcane serial-killer mythology, "Rejects" takes a less self-conscious romp through 1970s backwoods Alabama. Shot on desaturated Super-16 stock that gives it a fittingly rough-hewn look, this is lean, mean exploitation fare that proceeds with a menacing clarity of purpose.
That homicidal brother-sister duo -- Otis Driftwood (chillingly stoic Bill Moseley) and impish blond Baby Firefly (Sheri Moon Zombie, the scribe-director's wife) -- is back, as well as Mother Firefly (albeit played by a new actress, the spectacularly screechy Leslie Easterbrook). Wanted for a horrific series of satanic ritual murders involving organs and refrigerators, the family is ambushed by police in pic's tense opening shootout, which sends Otis and Baby on the run while Mother Firefly winds up in police custody.
The siblings eventually reunite with wayward pop Captain Spaulding (Sid Haig), a grinning, clown-faced sadist whose mugging in "House" suggested a cross between P.T. Barnum and Ed Gein. (Clown-phobic auds should, by and large, avoid Zombie's movies.) Meanwhile, the police operation tracking them down is headed by Sheriff Wydell (William Forsythe), who has his own personal agenda: His brother was one of the family's victims.
Transplanting the action to the road turns out to be Zombie's most inspired decision, excavating the film from the hoary funhouse cliches that bogged down its predecessor. It also lends a genuinely sad unpredictability to the quintet of innocents Captain Spaulding, Otis and Baby eventually terrorize: While the idiot thrill-seekers who stumbled into "House" more or less asked for their fate, the group here is simply in the wrong place (a rundown motel) at the wrong time.
What follows is at once the film's most gratuitous, objectionable sequence and its gripping raison d'etre: The victims, holed up in a motel room, are dispatched in all kinds of sickeningly creative ways, the most inventive (and hilarious, to judge by the howling applause at premiere screening) involving a mask made from a human face and a giant truck. The women, in particular, Gloria (Priscilla Barnes) and Wendy (Kate Norby), are forcibly disrobed and reduced to the cruelest of physical spectacles.
On a basic narrative level, sequence serves no purpose other than to supply the requisite sadistic kicks, and it will be the likely walkout point for moviegoers not on Zombie's particularly heartless wavelength. Those who stick around will find the story shifting gears and losing some momentum as the increasingly unhinged Sheriff Wydell, fancying himself the smiting hand of God, decides to take vengeance into his own hands.
He's aided in this by two bounty hunters (Danny Trejo and Diamond Dallas Page) and an unwilling accomplice in the form of Captain Spaulding's old pal Charlie (a solid Ken Foree). The violent climax could amount to a critique of vigilante justice, if pic did not take such obvious relish (which auds may very well share) at the sight of its predators turned into prey.
What rescues "Rejects" from puerility, aside from the indelibly raw perfs (especially from Moseley and Forsythe), is the sharp, undistracted focus of Zombie's direction. Every scene feels stripped down to its bare bones, with deft handheld camerawork and editing by Phil Parmet and Glenn Garland, respectively (although print screened featured a few unintended jump cuts that will be removed before theatrical release).
The tasty soundtrack is pure '70s heaven -- not a word that can applied to this film in any other context -- and makes memorably ironic use of Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird."

If in retrospect musician Rob Zombie 's 2003 directorial debut, House of 1,000 Corpses , reads like a yee-hawing harbinger of last fall's red-state triumph, then its sequel, The Devil's Rejects , is the smug Republican victory lap. In Corpses , a competent if unoriginal slasher movie, hipster travel guide researchers get lured into a lethal roadside attraction run by a family of psychopaths whose members are each named after a different Groucho Marx  character. Here, the Firefly clanled by Sid Haig 's Captain Spauldingkill more wantonly, as they flee arrest for murders committed in the original film. Whereas Corpses  was not without a sense of humor, Rejects  is not without Confederate histrionics, including its indefatigable taste for Southern-rock standards played over slow-motion shotgun carnage. When the highway finale at last arrives, one still has to endure nearly every bar of "Free Bird." By rubbing your nose in this hillbilly mayhem, Zombie all but dares you to acknowledge your liberal elitism, simply because just now, in Dubya's America, you don't happen to find anything particularly funny or lovable about stupid, dangerous provincials.
