         Ziad Doueiri's "Lila Says" is a lyrically graceful story of first love, between 19-year-old Chimo (Mohammed Khouas) and 16-year-old Lila (Vahina Giocante), who has just moved into Chimo's picturesque predominately Arab neighborhood in Marseilles, France. Chimo, who lives with his loving, elegant mother (Carmen Lebbos), has such promise as a writer that his teacher wants to send him to a special school in Paris, but he already sees himself as a loser, hanging out with his layabout pals and drifting into crime. That Chimo is handsome is not lost upon the beautiful, blond Lila, who also rightly discerns in him a sensitivity and intelligence totally lacking in his aggressively boorish friends.
 
  Lila has just discovered the power of her sexual attraction, and the diffident Chimo is the perfect target for her teasing and endless tales of outrageous sexual exhibitionism. Boldly confident, she captivates Chimo but is longer on talk than action. She is at the same time recklessly indifferent to her effect on Chimo's pals, especially his hot-headed best friend, Mouloud (Karim Ben Haddou), who is jealous of her zeroing in on Chimo.
 


         






    In what may well be genuine innocence, Lila is a surefire troublemaker, yet her ultimate influence on the real-life Chimo was to spur him on to writing the novel on which this captivating film is based. Raw, earthy yet tender and perceptive, "Lila Says" marks a strong directorial debut for Doueiri, who was Quentin Tarantino's camera operator on "Reservoir Dogs," "Pulp Fiction" and "Jackie Brown."

 With 'Rebound,' it's best to pass
 
 
If I were 6, I could enjoy "Rebound" without thinking about all the better movies made from its concept. It wouldn't matter that the central character, an egomaniacal college basketball coach named Roy McCormick (Martin Lawrence) is so preposterously immature that he wouldn't get past his first timeout in the real world. Coach Roy's tantrums and attention deficit issues make the grown-ups who run college basketball mad enough to put him on probation — which, in this case, means he can't coach any games until he proves himself worthy. But if he can't coach, how can he prove himself? The answer to this Catch-22 arrives in a faxed cry for help from a middle school where Roy once starred as a player but whose team hasn't scored so much as a foul shot since the first Bush administration. Lawrence wants to make this his "Daddy Day Care," but he insists on hogging the ball, showing off in a small but annoying turn as Preacher Don, whose appearance has no plot function except to let the star play dress-up. If I were 6, it wouldn't matter. But I'm not, and it does.

 Getting personal with the Wagners
 
 
For "The Talent Given Us" writer-director Andrew Wagner persuaded his parents, Judy and Allen Wagner, and his actress sisters, Maggie and Emily, to play themselves pretty much, and no doubt the film means much to him as a means of expressing affection and strengthening family bonds. It's difficult, though, to see how this picture — essentially chronicling a long car trip — could mean much to anyone but the Wagners and their friends and relatives.
 
 "The Talent Given Us,"
 unrated. Blunt language involving sex; adult themes. Running time: 1 hour, 37 minutes. Sunset 5, 8000 Sunset Blvd. (323) 848-3500.
 
 Zombie tedium
 
 
Peter and Michael Spierig's "Undead" is an ambitious but murky and overlong zombie picture that borrows motifs from "Night of the Living Dead," "Close Encounters of the Third Kind," "ET" and other movies. However visually striking, this Australian film is ultimately as tedious as it is derivative.
 
 "Undead,"
 rated R for strong violence and gore, and for language (standard zombie horror blood and guts). 1 hour, 40 minutes. Nuart through Thursday, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd. (310) 281-8223.   

In Undead , this tongue-through-cheek George A. Romero knockoff from Australia, there is one funky visual gag: A walking corpse gets severed and the legs keep walking, with about a third of a bloody spine sticking up. The rest of Undead , which combines a meteor shower with a living-dead attack in ways that I never quite understood, is on the level of a no-budget student film in which the shots barely match up into sequences. It's about as much fun as watching blood dry.

"Undead," the debut feature from the Australian twins Peter and Michael Spierig, is a broad mishmash of zombie horror, old-fashioned sci-fi, spaghetti western, slapstick comedy and high-tech "Matrix"-style action that bites off more than it can chew but does so without any real teeth. It has been two years since its home-country release, and it is a wonder it made it to the United States at all. Audiences seeking a genuine zombie fix are better off with repeat viewings of George A. Romero's far superior "Land of the Dead," released only last week. Logic is rarely the driving force of zombie films, but the premise of "Undead" is beyond preposterous: small meteorites shower the quaint fishing village of Berkeley, Australia, polluting the water supply and quickly transforming infected inhabitants into brain-munching maniacs. All potential escape routes are sealed off by a massive circular metal wall that mysteriously falls from the sky. A small group of survivors, including a reluctant beauty queen, Rene (Felicity Mason), her pregnant, dethroned rival and two bumbling cops, hole up at a farmhouse inhabited by Marion (Mungo McKay), the town's designated weirdo. He's a gruff-talking hick with overalls, spurs, a floppy hat - and a true talent for gunplay. Once ridiculed for his space-abduction stories, he may now be their only salvation. The film's visual effects, though impressive in number for a low-budget production, are mostly amateurish (the same goes for the acting), but there are a few inventive, comic moments scattered throughout (like a flying zombie fish and some clever dismemberments) and effective tongue-in-cheek snippets of dialogue. But the most memorable image occurs after a wacky genre shift from horror to sci-fi: thousands of bodies are beamed high into the air where they dangle listlessly. After a swift opening 20 minutes, "Undead" settles into a monotonous walking-dead pace. In the end, the film is a stale, derivative mess that borrows heavily from every zombie and alien movie worthy of imitation, to only ho-hum effect - the slice-and-dice carnage inflicted by the saw blade on Rene's broomstick does not compare to the dazzling blood-and-guts bath of the lawn mower in Peter Jackson's unparalleled horror-comedy zombie flick "Dead-Alive." The hooded, light-emanating extraterrestrials in "Undead," who inexplicably appear to save humankind from devastation, may sound like the whispering Gollum, but based on this inauspicious beginning, it seems unlikely there will be a "Lord of the Rings" in the Spierig brothers' future. "Undead" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence and gore.

Yet another pair of twin brothers, Peter and Michael Spierig from Queensland, Australia, arrive on the film scene with "Undead," a modestly budgeted but precociously inventive horror pic that combines brain-eating zombies with outer space aliens. The brothers, who produced, scripted, edited and designed the film's visual and computer effects as well as directing, take a few liberties with the standard formula even as they pay shameless tribute to such helmers as George Romero and Peter Jackson. Horror buffs worldwide will doubtless respond, even though the film's threatened humans aren't a very likeable bunch and a grievously overlong running time reps a definite downer. But still, "Undead" is likely to do cult business in hardtops and there's some tasty ancillary down the track.

A meteor shower dumps rocks and acid rain on the small fishing village of Berkeley, Qld. Citizens quickly begin to change, adopting the buggy white eyes, flaky skin, shuffling walk and growling sounds of movie zombies. They promptly start chomping on their fellow citizens.
Of course, there are a handful of survivors. Rene (Felicity King), Berkeley's reigning Miss Catch of the Day Queen, attempts to leave town because the bank has foreclosed on her recently-deceased parents' farm. But the road is blocked by crashed cars, so she reluctantly teams up with local pilot Wayne (Rob Jenkins) and his extremely pregnant girlfriend (and former beauty queen rival), Sallyanne (Lisa Cunningham).
These three are joined by two cops, foul-mouthed Harrison (Dirk Hunter) and meek rookie Molly (Emma Randall), and they all take shelter at a remote house occupied by mysterious Marion (Mungo McKay), a bearded sharpshooter.
It takes far too long for the bickering cops to realize that the well-armed Marion is their salvation, and Hunter's Harrison, especially, proves to be exasperating company. Mason's somewhat enigmatic Rene is the most interesting character, especially toward the end as she seems to be heading for Ripley status as an heroic icon.
Still, there's plenty of gore, plus last-minute escapes, fancy shooting and even acrobatics by the resourceful Marion. But, in the late going, the film veers off into quite another direction and becomes genuinely strange and a bit eerie.
The Spierigs unquestionably have talent, but as yet it's a bit undisciplined. Dialogue is deliberately silly, but CGI effects, though not up to the standard of a big budget mainstream film, are more than adequate and quite inventive. The same goes for make-up. There are a few gross-out elements for die-hard gore fans.
But, perhaps because a lack of involvement in the human characters, the film becomes a long haul. Faster pacing could have shaved off up to 20 minutes.
Production values are solid, with Cliff Bradley's rousing music score adding distinction to the deliberately shlocky goings-on.

A true hole in the head, the new Aussie zombie farce Undead  revisits, yet again, the Romero template by way of early Peter Jackson : a small outback town, glowing meteors, growling mobile corpses, acting and writing conceived and executed as a form of gargoyle vaudeville. Quickly, the various characters are collected into a bickering mini-mob (including two warring beauty queens, a couple of gun-crazy cops, and a mysterious cowboy who shoots two-handed while doing flips), which retreats into a survivalist bomb shelter and then backs out again. As always, the walking dead are eliminated via head woundsafter 37 years, Romero's afterthought has come to have the immutability of a physical law. The most is made of the low-budget decapitations, if that's your idea of how to spend a ten-spot, and the tone veers from genuine attempts at Romero-ness to post Dead Alive  lampoon. Watching it is a smidgen like listening to the same monkey-walks-into-a-bar joke for the 105th time, but for the Spierig brothers, it is clearly a demonstration of fast-cheap capabilities and a one-way ticket straight out of Queensland .
