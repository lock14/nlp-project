         Say you were actor-writer-director Mike Binder, and you lived every day with the terrible burden of having loosed a show called "The Mind of the Married Man" (one of HBO's late, unlamented early stabs at a male "Sex and the City") on a trusting world. What would you do for your next trick?
 
  If you really wanted to atone, you'd make a smart, funny, warmhearted movie about a bitter, elitist, stay-at-home lush; set her up with the sweet, washed-up, drunken jock down the street; cast yourself in a minor role as the twitchy, cradle-robbing lech who winds up alone, and then, OK, bygones would be bygones.
 


         






    "The Upside of Anger" is a terrible title for a genuinely likable comedy-drama about a housewife who falls rather extravagantly to pieces after her husband leaves one day without warning. Grey Wolfmeyer mysteriously disappears three days after his young assistant's sudden return to her native Sweden, so, as any self-respecting executive wife would, Terry Wolfmeyer (Joan Allen) naturally assumes he's run off to enjoy the lingonberry pancakes and a good laugh at her expense. Instead of trying to reach out to Grey, Terry reaches for the Grey Goose, interrupting cocktail hour just long enough to encourage thoughts of patricide in her four beautiful daughters.
 
  When Denny Davies (Kevin Costner), the has-been baseball star down the street, finds out what's happened, he embarks on a patient campaign to win Terry over. Denny, who spends his days refusing to talk baseball on his radio talk show (much to the irritation of the station's managers), then goes home to drink and sign balls, boasts the sort of empty home life that makes the Wolfmeyer household look like a Norman Rockwell painting.
 
  It doesn't bother him at all, for instance, that Terry's daughters, Hadley (Alicia Witt), Emily (Keri Russell), Andy (Erika Christensen) and Popeye (Evan Rachel Wood), share the same expectant, somewhat tense air of a First Response team on duty — ready to spring into action at the drop of a hat with a sympathetic "I hate him too!" (To which Terry replies with some variation on, "I know you do, honey. How could you not? You're human!") And he's willing to hit extremes to make himself welcome at the dinner table, even going so far as to ask one of the girls to recite "Brownie" — by which he means "Browning" — like she used to when she was a kid. Naturally, the girls leap at the chance to mock him mercilessly, which delights him to no end.
 
  "What's so funny?" Andy asks.
 
  "Nothing," he says, giggling. "It's all so female."
 
  "The Upside of Anger" is a squarely suburban movie with a distinctly bourgeois-shaped window on the world, but it's genuine and exceptionally well observed. All of the characters seem to exist on a complicated emotional plane between self-awareness and denial. They're grateful for their privilege but still feel gypped. The movie ends with a twist I never saw coming — at least not in the package it did. But more than that, it's the kind of twist that inspires reflection rather than gag reflex — which these days is really a twist on the old twist.
 
  Binder based the movie in part on his experiences as the child of a "broken home" — an expression Popeye uses as a pickup line on a cute boy in her class. But he captures the miasmic emotional transferences between mothers and their teenage daughters (invisible to the naked eye but capable of inflicting gamma-ray-level mutational devastation) so well that you half-wonder if he ever was one himself.
 
  I should probably point out that I'm by no means suggesting that Binder simply had to swap contemptible men for contemptible women and all would be right with the world. Terry Wolfmeyer is nobody's idea of a nice lady. And, if anything, the men in the movie are far more deserving of sympathy than the women. (Denny has his flaws, but by any standard the guy is a prince, a teddy bear and 
a rock rolled into one — which I suppose makes him something like the plushy version of Prince William? Harry? Haakon of Norway?) The one irredeemable character in the movie is Shep (writer-director Binder himself), Denny's best friend and producer, who gives the just-out-of-high school Andy a job at the station and proceeds to start an affair with her.
 
  The difference in tone between the series and the movie, in other words, has nothing to do with gender swapping and everything to do with Binder having created fully realized, complex characters whose humanity makes us like them because of, not in spite of, their many flaws. Naturally, much of that credit goes to the actors. Allen, in particular, is so rage-fueled and kinetic, I can't help remembering her, in retrospect, like an animated character: a Tasmanian devil type in a shift dress.
 
  Narrated by Popeye, who is working on a class project about the transformative effects of anger (it seems a little esoteric for the ninth grade, but OK), the movie sits back contentedly and lets Terry spin completely out of control, much in the same way Denny does.
 
  It's a great piece of against-the-grain casting: The usually imperturbable Allen practically self-combusts with bitterness and rage, while usually steely Costner achieves near-Jeff Bridges levels of chilled-out equanimity. He's the easygoing beleaguered guy, patron saint of high-maintenance women everywhere, the kind of guy who can weather a heartfelt postcoital line like, "God, that was a misstep," without so much as a flinch. (Sure, he kicks a door down later, but by the time he gets around to it, he's banked enough goodwill miles to get him to Bangkok.)
 
  As for Shep, Terry knocks him flat on the lawn in the middle of a wedding. Shep-as-Shep, you're happy to see him go down. Shep-as-Binder, not so much. But by the time it happens near the movie's end, past transgressions have long been forgiven.

Most actors treat aging as something to be ashamed of. Either they work overtime  to look rugged and fit beyond their years (not that there's anything wrong with that), or they turn into wax-dummy versions of their former selves, like John Travolta in Be Cool . Kevin Costner, though, was playing past his prime when he was still a matinee idol (notably in Bull Durham ), and a certain grizzled, gone-to-seed dishevelment has always looked good on him. It's part of his unforced masculine grace  his willingness, more than that of most stars, to undercut his own vanity.
In Mike Binder's The Upside of Anger , Costner plays yet another over-the-hill sports paragon, a retired Detroit Tigers star named Denny Davies who coasts through his days in a genial haze of booze and faded celebrity. Denny, who hosts a talk-radio show in which he likes to ramble on about everything but his glory days, keeps the money flowing in by signing baseballs and showing up to open the occasional mall. It's a living, of sorts, but not quite a life, and no one knows that better than Denny. That's why he's eager to hook up with Terry (Joan Allen), a battle-scarred suburban housewife with a big woodsy colonial home, four beautiful daughters (and I do mean beautiful  they're played by Erika Christensen, Keri Russell, Alicia Witt, and Evan Rachel Wood), and a husband who has apparently run off with his secretary. Gulping Grey Goose cocktails before noon, Terry is as big a lush as Denny, but more than that, the two fit together. They're drinking buddies and dissolute soul mates; it's up to Denny to show her that they could be more.
To do that, he's got to break down the wall of her stubborn rage. Joan Allen, with her gift for tensile hostility, makes Terry a forceful, at times ripely comic, creation: a woman who has had her blinders, and manners, ripped away by despair. Now she says whatever comes into her head, strangely liberated by her ordeal. The film's tone, however, remains gentle and affectionate, a shade too evenhanded. Since everyone around Terry knows that she's ''acting out'' her pain, they all cut her the appropriate slack. I kept thinking, How did four daughters this non-neurotic emerge from a mother this high-strung? The Upside of Anger  is overly therapized, yet Costner and Allen show you what it means not just to play a role but to inhabit it.

he Upside of Anger," written and directed by Mike Binder, is a seriously flawed movie wrapped around two nearly perfect performances. Joan Allen and Kevin Costner play a pair of drifting suburban neighbors whose last-resort companionship blossoms into an unlikely love affair, and though the movie's premise is shaky, its story thin and its surprise-twist ending an utter catastrophe, the two stars bring such ease, wit and conviction to their roles that this awkward, underwritten attempt to blend midlife romantic comedy with domestic melodrama almost works in spite of itself. Part of the pleasure in watching Ms. Allen and Mr. Costner comes from seeing them slip comfortably into the kinds of characters they have always done best - as if, in some parallel movie universe, Crash Davis, the semi-washed-up baseball player in "Bull Durham," had hooked up with Elena Hood, the stifled and betrayed wife and mother from "The Ice Storm." It's not just that Denny Davies, a one-time World Series hero spending his retirement drinking beer, selling autographs and presiding over a radio call-in show, shares a sport (and most of a surname) with Crash. It's more that Mr. Costner somehow comes most alive as an actor when he can loosen up enough to mix pride and disappointment, charm and sleaze. Denny, paunchy and slovenly, has gone so far to seed that you expect dandelions to sprout from his head, but he holds onto just enough of his old winner's optimism and grit to keep him from being completely pathetic. Mr. Costner's soft, slow, easy demeanor complements Ms. Allen's fierce, angular presence. The anger in the movie's title belongs mainly to her character, Terry Wolfmeyer, a Michigan housewife whose husband has abruptly disappeared, leaving her with four nearly grown daughters, a dog and a taste for high-end vodka. She radiates rage, and it has the effect of making her radiant, and also a little intimidating, qualities that attract Denny, whose geniality masks a deep ennui. When he shows up, uninvited, on Terry's back patio (and, later, in her bathroom) nursing a mid-morning tallboy, she tolerates his company. Later she decides to sleep with him out of a combination of boredom, curiosity and spite - directed at him, herself, her vanished husband and the tapestry of proper appearances and correct behavior that has shrouded and smothered her life to date. Together, the two of them do enough drinking to give credence to Homer Simpson's observation that alcohol is both the cause of and the solution to most of life's problems, but Mr. Binder is tolerant of their weaknesses. For all their difficulties with themselves and each other, Terry and Denny are easy to like, and the film is most satisfying as a chronicle of how they come to like each other. Much of the time, Terry treats Denny like one of those clown balloons half-filled with sand; hard as she pushes and punches, he always comes up smiling, and refuses to go away. He, on the other hand, is looking for a way to relieve the boredom that defines his life, and her volatility provides him with plenty of surprises. But over the course of three years, they slide, without really meaning to, into a prickly, habitual intimacy. The problem is that they don't exist in a credible dramatic context. Terry's four daughters -  played, in ascending order of age, by Evan Rachel Wood, Erika Christensen, Keri Russell and Alicia Witt, all of them lovely and spirited -  have the minimal individuality required of characters in television pilots. Their shifting alliances with Terry, Denny and one another are sketched out in talky, perfunctory scenes, but Mr. Binder does not come close to capturing the stickiness and density of family life. The film's chronological scheme does not help. In the course of three years, the cycle of domestic events  is  marked as haphazardly as the changing of seasons: snow is falling, then someone's graduating, then the leaves are turning, then a baby arrives. The establishing scene -  the one that precedes the appearance on screen of the words "three years earlier"  -  is of Denny, Terry and her youngest daughter on the way to a funeral. This gives Mr. Binder the opportunity to manipulate the audience's emotions in a particularly obnoxious way. Every time something bad happens, or seems to be about to happen, we have to wonder which secondary character is going to be killed off. The answer to this question comes close to wrecking the whole movie. At the least, it undermines the logic of Terry's character and warps the film's narrative logic beyond repair. Mr. Binder (who has a funny, self-mocking role as Seth Goodman, Denny's louche, shaggy radio producer) was the creator of the wretched "Mind of a Married Man," an HBO series for viewers who could not handle the subtlety and insight of "Arliss." He has certainly, with "The Upside of Anger," edged a bit closer toward the emotional realities of modern adults, but he has not quite overcome the temptation to let glibness stand for sensitivity. This time, Mr. Costner and Ms. Allen rescue him from phoniness, but he may not always be so lucky. "The Upside of Anger" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, sexual situations and some drug use.
Contrary to the title, it's all downside here. Having announced that her husband has absconded to Sweden  with his mistress, affluent suburban-Detroit homemaker Terry (Joan Allen ) dives headfirst into a barrel of Scotch and redirects the rage of the betrayed wife onto her four fair daughters, her hubby's wardrobe, and loitering neighbor Denny (Kevin Costner ), a faded baseball champ turned sauced radio host who makes a second home out of Terry's newly manless abode, where the TV set hums with the late-2001 drone of anthrax scares and the war in Afghanistan . Lousy with drink and self-pity, Terry alternately ignores, resents, and exacerbates the various troubles of her apparently housebound girls: Aspiring dancer Keri Russell  won't eat; thoughtful teen Evan Rachel Wood  dabbles in bad voice-over narration ("It's real, though, the fury, even when it's not"); pregnant bride Alicia Witt  is boring and bourg; and college-averse hottie Erika Christensen  voluntarily and repeatedly enters sexual congress with Shep, the greased rodent who manages Denny's  radio affiliate and happens to be played, in an endlessly fascinating casting decision, by writer-director Mike Binder . (Costner and Binder maintain the same, somewhat pubic six-day stubble throughout.) The love match between puffy, giddy lush Denny and gaunt, wrathful lush Terry only convinces when the blood alcohol levels reach their peak (Costner's big moment: "I am sick of being your bitch!") and the film has exhausted itself with fits of glib hysteria long before its truly stupefying final twist, a stunning betrayal of audience trust.
