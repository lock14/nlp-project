Hello, police? Come quick! A naked man just leapt over a fake-looking waterfall.
Describe him? I don't know. Bee Gees hair. Clint Eastwood scowl. Zero-percent body fat. And a metal endoskeleton that would make him hell to stand behind at airport security. I think he just hosted the Oscars.
This naked man  - known the world over as Hugh Jackman  - is slogging his way through "X-Men Origins: Wolverine." I can't say why this movie is necessary, but here it is, all 107 minutes and $10 gazillion of it.
As the title implies, the movie presents the X-Men's most volatile mutant's early years, when he was neither the mysterious Logan nor lawless Wolverine but the virtually indestructible, apparently immortal James Howlett.
This is big news for those dying to see actual bone spiking from James's knuckles instead of the claws made of the strange substance (adamantium) the government injected along his skeletal system in a cruel military experiment.
There is Wolverine trivia. Did you know, for instance, that he fought in the Civil War, the two World Wars, and Vietnam? (There's a montage for your enlightenment.) He did so alongside his more heartless brother, Victor (Liev Schreiber). When James walks out on Victor and the band of assassins doing covert military work for the rogue general Stryker (Danny Huston), Victor tracks him down in the Pacific Northwest, where he's been living as a civilian logger named Logan. He kills Logan's dewy ladylove (Lynn Collins), and draws him into Ye Olde Hunt for Revenge, which culminates in an entertaining showdown on the lip of a nuclear reactor.
"Wolverine" feels enslaved to its many masters  - Marvel Comics, Hollywood, and the young men who devour their products  - never sidestepping the déjà vu it inspires. I've seen this movie before, and it's not because my barber hooked me up with a leaked DVD, although there is that. It's partly a matter of having seen this character struggle with his origins in three previous X-Men movies, one of which gave us a comprehensive explanation in blips of flashback.
Often it seemed that the comic's original collection of writers were unsure of who Wolverine was or how he came to be. I spent many hours as a boy trying to figure out what the deal was with this guy. Whatever his back story, he was an intriguing character  - nasty, vicious, bitter, dangerous, and, in his own way, sexy.
In Bryan Singer's 2000 "X-Men," Jackman captured all of that, in star-making fashion. We would never really know Logan  - he wouldn't let us. But we wanted to know more about Jackman. Nothing he's done in the movies since has been as interesting or believably intense. His stage and emcee work suggests he's a more thrilling showman than action figure.
Inside an ensemble, Jackman had other people to chafe. On his own, at least here, he's just another physical specimen in a movie that doesn't have nearly as many ideas  - visually or thematically  - as anything in the "X-Men" trilogy. In "Wolverine," his exasperated, give-me-a-break moments are his best  - they're certainly the most relatable. Otherwise, there's not much for Jackman to do opposite Schreiber, Huston, or Ryan Reynolds, who's put to comically bad use playing what appears to be the same part he had in the last "Blade" movie  - the smarty-pants who appears to eat shoulder-presses for breakfast.
Director Gavin Hood ("Tsotsi," "Rendition") likes shot-making you can get from a kit  - the wounded screaming at the sky as the camera sails heavenward, say, or the hero walking sternly, slowly out of the frame while something burns extravagantly behind him.
Advances in personal training and dietary supplements may have brought actors closer than ever to comic-book physiques. But movies based on comic books require a visionary at least equal to the one that made such vivid worlds of the books themselves. May future "Wolverine" installments feature moviemaking as steroidal as some of the bodies.

So, the makers of the industrial-strength franchise extender X-Men Origins: Wolverine  have now revealed the psychological roots of the famous ''berserker rage'' that has caused the title's angry Marvel superhero to bare his adamantium claws in three previous X-Men  movies. The question is, was anyone wondering? Or are you, like me, content enough to admire the cool, crazy talents of a society of freaks and geeks who find comfort in pooling their misunderstood powers? To put it another way: Is it possible to make a movie about a superhero these days without injecting scenes of dreary superambivalence between expensive action sequences? (Batman, Spider-Man, and the Hulk? Big brooders.) Or is blessed freedom from neurosis granted only to villains? (The Joker? A fun guy.)
The questions arise as Wolverine  launches a new X-Men  franchise based on origin myths that will allow for a pageant of younger stars. In the case of the superhero born James Howlett (known off duty as Logan, and boasting the Sexiest Man Alive beauty of entertainer Hugh Jackman), traumatic past experiences include a fatal misunderstanding back in 1845 with a sinister-looking man the young Wolverine-to-be couldn't have known at the time was his real father. (The lad also couldn't have known he'd grow up to sport a Paulie Walnuts hairdo.)
Likewise, there's emotional fallout from more than a century of love/hate between James/Logan/Wolverine and his lithe, fiery, and similarly clawed older brother, Victor (Liev Schreiber). During their long years on the run together, smacking down anyone who stood in their way, the mutant siblings fought side by side in the Civil War, two World Wars, and the Vietnam War, all in a matter of some 20 minutes of screen time. (Victor, whose own talons are extensions of his hobo fingernails, also goes by the name of Sabretooth, for self-explanatory dental reasons.) The experience of all that fighting turned Logan into something of a pacifist, or at least an Age of Psychotherapy introvert who wants to gain control of his own animal nature. In contrast, Victor has no such niggles about the thrill of destructive instincts. No wonder Schreiber provides the most unfettered pleasure in this guilt-racked action pic. (No wonder, too, that Jackman, in his capacity as producer, tapped South African filmmaker Gavin Hood to direct, after Hood's previous morality tales Tsotsi  and Rendition .)
You'd think all this would be enough shrinkwrapped backstory since the movie still needs space to introduce other, newer mutants for their moments in the spotlight. (Ryan Reynolds has fun as the adversary who later comes to be known as Deadpool; Friday Night Lights ' Taylor Kitsch gives an inkling of the charms he might display in a future episode as Gambit; Black Eyed Peas frontman will.i.am makes an appealing feature-film debut as John Wraith, a dude with a gift for now-you-see-him, now-you-don't.) But lest the ladies feel alienated by all the masculine conflict, the movie adds lover's grief as an additional motive for moodiness. And so we learn that Logan's bliss was interrupted at the happiest time in his life, when he was living simply as a hunky, often shirtless, law-abiding lumberjack in the Canadian Rockies, nesting with with his dishy schoolteacher girlfriend, Kayla Silverfox (Lynn Collins). After someone targets Kayla as a way of getting to her beau, Wolvie yowls luxuriously and flashes his erect talons. Why, ye gods of superhero comic books, is someone out to get him? And who's to blame?
Wolverine  climaxes in a pileup of explosions, complicated stunts, violent man-on-man fights, and hints, especially if you stay until the end of the credits, at sequels and spin-offs  each fancy sequence simultaneously lacking both weight and lightness: The effect-laden showdowns feel more dutiful than daring, and the rare moments of fun are parceled out frugally, like precious nuggets of adamantium. Meanwhile, buff and bronzed as an Oscar statuette, Jackman works the picture like a trouper. Heroes and villains clash, then rise up to clash again, just because that's what X-Men do. The truth is, it doesn't matter Y.

 In the crowded pantheon of comic-book-derived movie-franchise superheroes, Wolverine, as embodied by the muscular Australian song-and-dance man Hugh Jackman, always seemed kind of special. A grouchy, sensitive loner with retractable metal claws and apparently unretractable facial hair, Wolverine brooded and growled through the first three “X-Men” pictures, helping to supply them (or at least the first two) with welcome grace notes of rough humor and macho pathos. And now “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” with its ungainly, geeky title and its relatively trim (under-two-hour) running time, helps explain just what makes this guy so intriguing and unusual.  He’s Canadian.  This will not come as news to fans of the Marvel series from which this film, directed by Gavin Hood (“Rendition,” “Tsotsi”), with a screenplay by David Benioff and Skip Woods, has been adapted. Still, Wolverine’s nationality does, in the present context, raise some puzzling questions. What is he doing fighting in the American Civil War? Why does he talk like a Queens longshoreman who spent his childhood summers in Indiana?  Also: did you know he had a brother? Victor Creed, better known (though not in this movie) as Sabretooth, the venerable Marvel supervillain who at one point was thought to be Wolverine’s father, is actually his sibling. Go figure! We learn this thanks to a confusing precredit sequence, in which a paternity mix-up back in 1845 results in two deaths and further puzzling questions, like how did the paternity get mixed up in the first place? But this is a PG-13 movie, and therefore not inclined to dwell on icky matters of reproduction when there is wholesome bloodshed to pursue.  So Wolverine, still known as James Logan, his claws still ordinary bone rather than high-tech adamantium, spends the credit sequence fighting in a bunch of wars (and not in the uniform of his native land) alongside Victor. Victor’s claws sprout from his fingernails, rather than emerging from between his knuckles, and he is played by Liev Schreiber, who really did once live in Canada, and whose role here is not unlike the one he had in Edward Zwick’s “Defiance.” This time he is a rampaging mutant rather than a Jewish partisan, but in both cases he is the angrier, rougher member of a pair of brawling brothers.  And Mr. Schreiber, sporting fangs as well as mutton chops, gives the movie a surly kick, even though the digital effects that produce his leaping, animal-like movements look pretty crummy. The explosions and landscapes have a bit more eye appeal, but even the showstopping visual flights (including a climactic battle at Three Mile Island and a brawl on the streets of New Orleans) have a rushed, rote feel about them. What’s worse, the outsize emotions that give any decent superhero epic its adolescent, pop-operatic gravity are diminished by the sheer hectic confusion of the storytelling.  Victor and James (technically, he becomes Wolverine only after the adamantium implants) are comrades, then mortal enemies, then comrades again. After a falling-out in Vietnam, James retires to the Canadian Rockies, where a native legend he hears from his girlfriend, Kayla (Lynn Collins), inspires his eventual nickname. But first a lot of his former mutant comrades wind up dead, a development that unhappily, if coincidentally, echoes the recent, by now almost forgotten, “Watchmen” movie.  “Wolverine” is shorter and less pretentious than “Watchmen,” but almost programmatically unmemorable, a hodge-podge of loose ends, wild inconsistencies and stale genre conventions. Vengeance is the default motive for most of the mayhem that is perpetrated, and for good measure there is a military-scientific government conspiracy overseen by a reptilian bad guy (the excellent Danny Huston).  A flotilla of secondary characters parades through the scenery, mostly mutants with various powers and questionable franchise-enhancing capabilities. Ryan Reynolds, Taylor Kitsch and Will.i.am show up and do what they can, but prove hopelessly unable to compensate for the absence of, say, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin or Ian McKellen.  “X-Men Origins: Wolverine” will most likely manage to cash in on the popularity of the earlier episodes, but it is the latest evidence that the superhero movie is suffering from serious imaginative fatigue. A twist at the end that gives poor Wolverine a bad case of amnesia — turning him into a kind of Jason Bourne with sideburns — is a virtual admission that nothing terribly interesting has been learned about the character. He forgets his origins before the movie devoted to their exposition is even over. It won’t take you much longer.  “X-Men Origins: Wolverine” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Much slaughter, none of it excessively graphic, as well as some tame sexuality and a few glimpses of undraped superhero derrière.

Heavily fortified with adamantium, testosterone and CGI, "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is a sharp-clawed, dull-witted actioner that falls short of the two Bryan Singer-directed pics in the franchise but still overpowers 2006's "X-Men: The Last Stand." For all its attempts to probe the physiological and psychological roots of its tortured antihero, this brawny but none-too-brainy prequel sustains interest mainly -- if only fitfully -- as a nonstop slice-and-dice vehicle for Hugh Jackman. An unfinished print leaked online weeks before the film's May 1 Stateside release will prove a mere flesh wound to Fox's B.O. haul, which should be muscular locally and abroad.
Relatively unknown before the release of the first "X-Men" film in 2000, Jackman placed an immediate and definitive stamp on the role of Logan, the virtually indestructible human/mutant Cuisinart better known to Marvel comicbook fans as Wolverine. Though it's as thick with exposition as any cinematic adaptation of a complex and beloved superhero mythology, the screenplay by David Benioff and Skip Woods relies, to a lazy and excessive degree, on both Jackman's considerable charisma and fan awareness of Wolverine's preternatural abilities. There's little emotional modulation or sense of discovery as Logan morphs from hardened soldier to angry but principled rebel, seeking revenge on the mad scientist who engineered him.
An 1845-set prologue creepily if confusingly establishes this tale of two mutants: Logan (Jackman), whose knuckles are equipped with retractable fangs, and older, less stable brother Victor, aka Sabretooth (Liev Schreiber). The siblings' superhuman strength, agility and capacity for self-regeneration make them ideal soldiers to fight in the Civil War, WWI, WWII and Vietnam -- and all in one opening-credits sequence, no less -- before the coolly mysterious Gen. William Stryker (an effective Danny Huston) recruits them for a covert-ops unit known as Team X.
After a mission to Nigeria that involves civilian casualties, Logan decides he's had enough and flees, to Victor's violent chagrin. Six years later, Logan is living in Canada -- just to hammer home that he's a nice, peace-loving guy and all -- but is too easily drawn back into battle when his loving g.f. Kayla (Lynn Collins) dies at Victor's claws. Determined to slay his brother, Logan submits to a top-secret experiment by Stryker that will infuse his skeleton with a super-strong metal, adamantium, rendering him all but invincible. But he soon realizes he was naive to trust Stryker, whose inscrutably sinister motives take a while to fully emerge.
Still bent on finding Victor, and left temporarily if discreetly butt-naked after the experiment, Logan has an uneasy reunion with some of his former Team X compadres, including teleporter John Wraith (Will.i.am) and prosthetically overweight Fred Dukes (Kevin Durand), aka the Blob. It's here that Gavin Hood (helming his second studio feature, after "Rendition") sets the pic on action-thriller autopilot, ensuring that "Wolverine" meets its quota of motorcycle chases, helicopter accidents, fisticuffs, impalements, near-decapitations (one of the pic's weirder, more unsettling fixations) and yet more civilian casualties.
As the action takes hold -- and it's perfectly good action, though lensed and edited with more energy than coherence -- psychological plausibility falls by the wayside, as does any investment in the no-brainer question of whether Wolverine will succumb to his baser, bloodier impulses or take the high road in his pursuit of justice. A shot of Logan nonchalantly walking away from a heap of exploding wreckage, his good looks smoldering like so much digital napalm, says more about the story's dramatic priorities than any of the on-the-nose dialogue ("You're not an animal," "To kill him, you're going to have to embrace the other side," etc).
Script also traffics in the kind of flat, shopworn comic relief that's become de rigeur for superhero fare -- mostly courtesy of mutant Remy LeBeau, aka Gambit (Taylor Kitsch), a New Orleans cardsharp who teams with Logan at the midpoint. Absent from the "X-Men" movies until now, this rugged Southern charmer is one of the series' more popular characters, but his appearance here is poorly and arbitrarily integrated into the scenario.
Jackman just about holds things together with his reliable but hardly revelatory all-brooding-all-the-time act; for sheer bellowing rage, he's occasionally upstaged by Schreiber, whose grisly, vampiric presence has some interesting points of overlap with his role as another volatile bad-seed brother in Ed Zwick's recent "Defiance."
Noisy and impersonal, "X-Men Origins: Wolverine" bears all the marks of a work for hire, conceived and executed with a big budget but little imagination -- an exception being Barry Robison's intriguing production design for Stryker's island compound. Shot in Jackman's native Australia, the pic is apparently set in the 1970s, though one would have to read the press materials to realize this.
