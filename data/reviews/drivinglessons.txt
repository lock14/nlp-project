         Everybody in "Driving Lessons" is working very hard to show how affecting and touching their movie can be. Indeed, the collective effort invested in this ragged mongrel of a coming-of-age story may con even the most jaded moviegoer into thinking there's something profound being put forth. Forewarned, you may find it sweet enough to fill an empty afternoon.
 
 Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley from the "Harry Potter" series) plays 17-year-old Ben, a British vicar's son who writes poetry while acceding to the wishes of his somewhat fanatical mother (Laura Linney). To help with household expenses and break the monotony of playing a tree in Mum's Bible class play, Ben answers an ad from a legendary actress named Evie (Julie Walters) seeking someone to do errands and tidy up her house.
 


         






   Dame Evie turns out to be a salty number with mood swings as flamboyant as her wardrobe. As you figure, she's just the saucy old gal to pull our brooding, nerdy hero out of his shell, and she does: forcing him on an impromptu camping trip that turns into a road trip to an Edinburgh poetry reading. By the time he comes home to his infuriated mother and his diffident dad, Ben knows it's back to playing a tree unless Evie can save him.
 
 Writer and director Jeremy Brock's tale is semiautobiographical. (He too was a vicar's son who worked as a teen for a famous actress, in his case Peggy Ashcroft.) You'd think such real-life connections would inspire Brock, who co-wrote "The Last King of Scotland," to bring more edge and grit to his movie. Instead, "Driving Lessons" follows the well-worn path laid down by other, better movies while making strained, ludicrous things happen toward the end.
 
 The material forces Grint to overplay the mope act and Walters to overplay, period. Linney heroically applies shading to a devout monster. But this is a movie in which the hero is declared a poet by the grande dame "because you understand the power of words." There's only so much even the best of actors can do with such puffiness.

You feel for 17-year-old Ben (Rupert Grint). His mom is a controlling Bible thumper  (Laura Linney). His ''best friend'' is Evie, a hunched-over, Auntie Mame-ish actress (a shrill Julie Walters). In the rigged comic battle that ensues over his young soul, naturally Driving Lessons  is on swanny Evie's side (she steals the boy away for a road trip to Edinburgh  fun!), but Linney is too sensitive and capable an actress to play a stock villain like this. That everyone in the movie dislikes her makes you dislike everyone in the movie.

 “Driving Lessons” belongs to that hardy niche of British comedies designed as star vehicles for distinguished actresses (preferably Dames) of a certain age whose assignment is to win awards by devouring the scenery. Julie Walters, who does the chomping in “Driving Lessons,” isn’t yet a Dame like Maggie Smith, Judi Dench and Joan Plowright, who specialize in such tasks. But the movie carries Ms. Walters, who established her scenery-chewing credentials with “Educating Rita,” a step in that direction.  Ms. Walters is Evie Walton, a retired actress and legend in her own mind, who has affixed a bogus title to her name and flaunts a disheveled grandiosity to go with it. Despite her background interpreting Shakespeare and Chekhov, Dame Evie, as she calls herself, is known to the younger generation only from a trashy daytime soap opera called “The Shipping Magnates,” which one gushing follower of the show describes as “big on the gay scene.” When that fan parrots one of the catchphrases mouthed by Evie’s character — “I’m a woman, Leland, not an oil tanker” — Evie is not amused, but we are.  Veering between imperiousness and wild eccentricity, Evie hurls curses at the vegetation in her backyard while attacking it with pruning shears. Visitors who call on her unexpectedly might arrive to find her facedown on the floor, drunk. A lover of the outdoors, Evie persuades a friend to drive her to a campsite for the afternoon and, once there, swallows the car key to ensure that they have to stay the night. The key will appear in the morning, she promises:  she is “regular as clockwork.”  Evie tells whoppers. After an anxiety attack, she confides in her worried companion that she is suffering from a fatal illness and expects to die within months. A day or two later, she has forgotten this fabrication until he reminds her of it, and she dismisses her fib as nothing.  Her companion on the road, Ben (Rupert Grint, the talented young actor who has played Harry Potter’s sidekick in four films), is a shy, carrot-topped youth from a strict Christian household who takes a job as Evie’s assistant. Ben dabbles in poetry and pines after a priggish Bible-spouting girl in his church.  “Driving Lessons” is the directorial debut of Jeremy Brock, who wrote the screenplays for “Mrs. Brown” and “Charlotte Gray.” It was inspired by Mr. Brock’s teenage experience working one summer for Dame Peggy Ashcroft.  The dramatic core of the movie is the struggle for Ben’s soul waged between two female monsters: one lovable (Evie), if impossible, and the other thoroughly detestable (Ben’s holier-than-thou Bible-thumping mother, Laura). Played by Laura Linney with an impeccable British accent that matches her character’s smiles of icy piety, Laura is treated with a loathing rarely seen in movies since the Freudian 1950’s, when evil, castrating moms made convenient scapegoats.  This movie is no friend of the church. Ben’s emasculated father, Robert (Nicholas Farrell), is an ardent bird-watcher who delivers mealy-mouthed sermons and would rather warble birdcalls to his son than develop any meaningful communication. The monster mother, meanwhile, is having an adulterous affair with the handsome young man handpicked to play Jesus in a church pageant she is overseeing.  Ben’s role in this ridiculous charade is a eucalyptus tree. When this spectacle is finally put on and goes amok with the appearance of Evie, the image of Ben peering miserably through his costume of leaves and branches is laugh-out-loud funny.  In a bizarre act of charity, Laura has also brought into the house a cross-dressing lunatic named Mr. Fincham (Jim Norton), who ran over his wife. The character, who develops an obsession with wearing Laura’s clothes, is strictly a plot device, reserved for one act of rebellion near the end of the movie.  It is through Evie that Ben learns to break his mother’s rules. Although he hasn’t earned a driver’s license, Evie insists he be her chauffeur. Violating Laura’s curfew, he takes Evie camping and later shepherds her to a literary festival in Edinburgh. Their relationship metamorphoses from embattled to mutually nurturing.  The screwball aging diva genre isn’t the only formula guiding this stubbornly old-fashioned movie. “Driving Lessons” belongs to the silly feel-good mode of “The Full Monty,” “Calendar Girls,” “Billy Elliot,” “Kinky Boots” and dozens of other celebrations of Britons defying convention to become “free,” whatever that means. Since any connections between “Driving Lessons” and the real world are tangential at best, it’s a faux liberation: the easiest kind.  “Driving Lessons” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has profanity.

As a scriptwriter, Jeremy Brock ("Mrs. Brown," "Charlotte Gray") gravitates toward strong women and, in his directorial debut, sandwiches "Harry Potter" sidekick Rupert Grint between two mother figures (Julie Walters and Laura Linney, both thesping up a storm) whose respective excesses morally balance each other. Pic relies on chemistry that fairly crackles between the principals to successfully deliver its teen hero from familial repression and rescue its pubescent lead from child-star roles. Basically conservative yet titillatingly "eccentric" British laffer could succeed in the "Full Monty" import slot. 
Ben (Grint), a willing drudge for mother Laura's (Linney) indefatigable Christian works, dutifully brings food to elderly shut-ins, patiently performs in the church play or resignedly sits down to dinner with his mother's latest live-in charity case, a silent, wide-eyed old cross-dresser who just ran over his wife.
Ben empathizes with his henpecked vicar father (Nicholas Farrell), especially since he suspects his driving lessons with his mother serve as cover for her trysts with the sexy New Age curate (Jim Norton). But the shy, poetry-writing 17-year-old has no defense against his mother's implacable will.
Following up on mum's smiling suggestion that he get a summer job, Ben takes a position with self-proclaimed "Dame" Evie Walton (Walters), an outrageous over-the-hill actress. Evie tricks Ben into an unauthorized excursion to Edinburgh, where he loses his virginity and his job. A battle for Ben's soul ensues, pitting the Linney character's Christian pageantry against the Walters character's full-blown melodrama in a high camp church showdown.
The fact that the script is quasi-autobiographical (as an adolescent, vicar's son Brock spent a summer with Dame Peggy Ashcroft) can't mitigate its predictability. On the other hand, the forceful perfs of the two main divas manage to more or less blast away the moral bulwarks of this otherwise conventional coming-of-age story.
The fanatic gleam in Linney's eyes as she oh-so-sweetly lays down the law is matched only by the spectacle of her shuddering attempts to control her fury when thwarted. Walters chews up scenery in grand manner, nicely teetering between drunken helplessness and zesty hedonism. Grint, maintaining puppy-dog altruism, holds his own in the matriarchal maelstrom, redheadedly adorable to the end.
Tech credits are solid.

Helping out scary or crazy-looking old people as a means to come into one's own as an adult is a time-honored literary and cinematic conceit. In this case it's also semi-autobiographical, as writer-director Jeremy Brock  worked for Dame Peggy Ashcroft  as a lad. Rupert Grint , capably different here from his Harry Potter   persona, plays Ben, the vicar's son, pressured by his understated yet overbearing mother (Laura Linney , doing valiant battle with an English accent) to get a job. Circling the first appealing ad in the newspaper, Ben finds himself housekeeper and assistant to Evie Walton  (Julie Walters ), a loud, mercurial former grand dame of the stage who is mainly remembered for her stint on an '80s daytime soap. Initially, she's too much of a character for Ben to handle, but you just know that by the end of the day they will Learn Important Lessons from one another. The sentiment's a bit thick sometimes, but Walters remains sharp, and is sure to inspire drag queens everywhere.
