Anne Hathaway showed in Brokeback Mountain
 that she has the acting chops to keep her from getting pigeonholed as a princess diarist. Now graduating from the teen role that built her reputation in the two Princess Diaries
 films, Hathaway does more of the same in The Devil Wears Prada
, the confessional of a young working woman in New York City. Adapted from Lauren Weisberger�s bestselling roman � clef about the year she spent as an assistant to Anna Wintour, the legendarily demanding editor of Vogue
, The Devil Wears Prada
 offers a wicked look into the top tier of the fashion world, a world that makes most of us feel like voyeurs at the big prom. Hathaway plays Andy Sachs, an aspiring journalist who has just graduated from college and moved to New York with her impossibly cute boyfriend (Grenier, of Entourage
 fame) to begin her career. Somehow she lands an interview at Runway
 magazine, the bible of fashion, whose editor Miranda Priestley (Streep) has a reputation as a dragon lady. In a very smart move, Streep underplays the part so that her Miranda never needs to raise her voice to get what she wants. If anything, a raised eyebrow depicts the full extent of her displeasure. She exudes the imperiousness of royalty, which comes from her absolute confidence in her position as the ultimate arbiter of all things fashion. Also wonderful is her No. 1 assistant, Emily (Blunt), whose fashion hauteur barely covers her deep insecurities. When the film is in the presence of Streep and Blunt it bubbles like a glass of champagne, barely alcoholic but intoxicating nonetheless. In the meantime, Hathaway gets bogged down in Andy�s dreary story about learning that there�s more to life than selling your soul for a pair of Jimmy Choo�s. She begins the movie as someone who cares not one iota about fashion, but after enough withering comments about how grossly overweight she is as a size 6, Andy succumbs to the pressure. She is helped in putting a new wardrobe together by Runway
�s style queen Nigel (Tucci) � one of only two gay men depicted anywhere in this fashion parade, which is also curiously drug-free. In many ways The Devil Wears Prada
 suffers from some of the same unreality that marred Sex & the City
, and perhaps not unrelated is that director Frankel directed at least half-a-dozen episodes of that HBO series. Also, noted costume designer Patricia Field comes to Prada
 by way of Sex & the City
. Like Carrie Bradshaw�s magnificent apartment paid for on a New York columnist�s salary, the implausibility of Andy�s new duds is never broached. In other words, if you shut down your brain and simply take in the wardrobe and performances by Streep and Blunt you�ll have a swell time, like aimlessly flipping the pages of a fashion magazine.


As you might recall, Lauren Weisberger transformed her stint toiling for the imperious Vogue editor Anna Wintour into a piece of chick lit called ``The Devil Wears Prada," in which a recent grad took an assistant's job at a major New York fashion magazine. Andy Sachs, Weisberger's alter ego, cared not a whit for fashion. For her, the job was a steppingstone to the loftier editorial climes of The New Yorker. The brisk, bumbling, name - dropping nature of Weisberger's prose suggested a heroine who only said
 she had read The New Yorker. But who cares?
The book was a hit, and Hollywood called. Yet a funny thing happened on the way to the megaplex. The movie holds on to a lot of Weisberger's frills (couture, bitchery, gossip!) but rebukes her opportunistic shallowness. ``The Devil Wears Prada" now has a brain and a point to make. This adaptation is about two women of different generations at philosophical odds over careerism. Meryl Streep plays the older woman, Miranda Priestly, and Anne Hathaway plays Andy. And while the picture isn't brilliant, it is, at its most entertaining, a kicky, surprisingly astute throwback to bygone Hollywood social comedies.
Miranda is the legendary editor in chief of Runway, whose glossy pages have featured Halston dresses and literary geniuses. Her whims are frequent, her needs many. Meeting them calls for two assistants. One spot is vacant. To the horror of her current assistant, a divinely tart Brit named Emily (Emily Blunt), Andy shows up to fill it. Her hair is frizzed. Her outfit appears to be from Express. And she has no idea who Miranda Priestly is. In other words, she's probably the average American woman.
But Andy was the editor in chief of The Daily Northwestern, her college newspaper, and has designs on a serious career in journalism. She offers Miranda a good speech about being a hard worker and fast learner, and soon she's sitting outside the boss's office, across from Emily, obeying whatever ridiculous command either of them gives her.
The to-do lists are, indeed, preposterous. Procure lunchtime Smith & Wollensky steak. Find pilot crazy enough to fly Miranda back to Manhattan during hurricane. Track down unpublished Harry Potter manuscript for her twins. To underscore the inanity, the movie offers a hilarious montage in which Miranda dumps her coat and bag on Andy's desk about 15 times. Each dump comes with a nutty demand disguised as a question (``Where's that piece of paper I had in my hand yesterday?").
The screenwriter, Aline Brosh McKenna, has renovated most of the book, and the movie is still as busy as Andy is overworked. Andy now lives with her supportive sous-chef boyfriend (Adrian Grenier) and is being wooed by a connected writer (Simon Baker) with possibly frosted eyebrows and a creepy knack for showing up at the opening of anything. Her best friend (Tracie Thoms) righteously and gratuitously disapproves of the romantic entanglements.
At work, when she's not fetching coffee or dogs or skirts, she's absorbing the sting of Miranda's and Emily's putdowns, mostly about her weight. (These humiliations must be a joke since Hathaway is the skinniest person in the movie.) Andy must also tolerate more barbs from Nigel (Stanley Tucci), a Runway senior editor who calls her by dress size (``Wake up, Six!") but winds up whipping her into style. Wearing big, round glasses and getups that could double as screensavers, Tucci brings a debonair human touch to his unkind fashion queen. He and Blunt are very good at walking the tightrope between tangy hauteur and downright nastiness.
Streep's approach is similar, if more bone-dry. I was worried -- or was I excited? -- that she would see a thinly conceived, ostensibly heartless character as an opportunity to ham her heart out. But this is neither her ``Scarface" nor her ``Mommie Dearest." Despite that ash-gray Cruella De Vil haircut, Miranda is more than a cartoon. Streep delivers her monologues and dismissals with light, regal exasperation. Imagine Catherine Deneuve in English.
Playing the part under the top, as it were, yields a more imaginative comic creation. Miranda doesn't bark, which leaves you afraid that she actually will bite. The woman is a diva and a child. But as ``The Devil Wears Prada" carefully explains, she is also a first-class businesswoman with the political acumen of Elizabeth I.
Like the rest of the country, Hollywood has never been entirely sure what to make of powerful women in the workplace. In the movies, all the female bosses seemed to have been written with the Faye Dunaway character in ``Network" in mind, women positively orgasmic with ambition. (See Demi Moore in ``Disclosure.") It would follow that a movie about two talented, determined women -- one established, the other ascendant -- would be a tale of comeuppance, which, in a sense, is what Weisberger had in mind for Wintour by publishing her book.
But the film is more judicious. Brosh McKenna and the director, David Frankel, who's made several effervescent ``Sex and the City" episodes, don't pit Miranda and Andy against each other. (They don't truly pit Andy against Emily either.) This is a movie with some of the classic social texture of 1950's ``All About Eve" (even the drudgery seems glamorous) or the urbanity of 1988's ``Working Girl," with little of either's conniving.
In her own withering way, Miranda teaches Andy that fashion is not a hobby, not for her, her employees, or many of her readers. (Streep gives a fantastic aria about the history of a sweater.) She also gives her a front-row glimpse of the chess-move savvy required for a middle-age woman to survive at the top of any industry. That crest of gray hair seems like a triumphant measure of longevity.
Andy, in turn, shows Miranda that she's worthy of her respect. Hathaway, meanwhile, is worthy of ours. Anybody who caught her quick, early scenes as a rodeo princess in ``Brokeback Mountain" knows of her disarming sweetness. (That wink she gave Jake Gyllenhaal would have made Dale Evans quit show business.) Here she's not competing with Streep; instead she's using those polka-dot eyes to carve out a blithe space for herself.
When watching Hathaway , the tendency might be to think about Julia Roberts, but that occurred to me only while watching her gallop through the streets of Paris and Manhattan in ball gowns and stilt-like heels. In a few of the outfits (a head-to-toe Chanel number comes to mind), she looks like one of those paper dolls that you dress by folding tabs around the body. Far from being a mannequin, Hathaway wears these clothes with a cross-purpose that suits her character's seriousness about work. They may be high fashion. But they also make snazzy uniforms.


         Anna WINTOUR must be pleased. The new movie adaptation of "The Devil Wears Prada," adapted from Lauren Weisberger's barely skimmable roman à clef about the year she spent as the Vogue editor's assistant, not only casts doubts as to who the actual heroine of the story is, it's very clear on who's the star of the show. A serious improvement on the tantrum that inspired it, the movie is funnier and more evenhanded in its point of view. If living well is the best revenge, then being portrayed by Meryl Streep in peak comic form has got to run a close second.
 
  With her crested gray mane, laser glare and perfectly modulated stealth missile sarcasm, Miranda Priestly, the editor in chief of the fictional Vogue clone, Runway, is still a monster. But as the sage Bugs Bunny once noted, monsters are the most interesting people. Yes, she still makes constant, outrageous demands, but that's just the surface, the icing, if you like. Streep invests her Miranda with the brains, ambition and cold blood to stay on top of what the saucer-eyed Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway) sees as a frivolous fashion rag but others, including the world's top designers and the head of the publishing company Elias-Clark, know to be a major cash cow, and therefore sacred.
 


         






    Runway magazine sells desire, which in turn sells everything else. Desire is stoked by exclusivity and unattainability, so Miranda can hardly be cuddly or accessible. She enters each scene like a shark crashing a tuna party, dispersing smaller fish in all directions, and willfully refuses to learn Andy's name until she's good and ready.
 
  Against such a formidable opponent, Andy doesn't stand a chance. Nor should she. Hathaway plays a slightly different sort of Andy from the Andy of the book. Where she was a Connecticut-bred Brown University graduate, Andy is now slightly dowdier, more sincere, presumably with fewer semiotics classes under her belt.
 
  Freshly sprung from Northwestern's Medill School of Journalism, she nevertheless shows up for her interview at the fictional magazine publishing juggernaut Elias-Clark having never even heard the name Miranda Priestly. Considering Miranda's celebrity editor status, and Andy's credentials, this takes an added obtuseness. In the book, Andy's not knowing who Miranda is was supposed to represent some kind of Ivy League purity. But the movie, thankfully, knows better.
 
  Hathaway's Andy is pretty and likable enough, but there's something about her that gives off the unmistakable scent of a doofus. Hers is a bovine complacency that inspires aggression more than affection, and the hungry and panic-honed lackeys at Runway sense it right away.
 
  No longer funneled through Andy's blinkered point of view, and pretty well divested of its revenge agenda, the script generously distributes brains and a way with insults among the objects of Weisberger's contempt. Miranda's newly promoted first assistant, Emily (the scene-stealing Emily Blunt), despairs when Miranda unpredictably hires the hopelessly style-challenged and contemptuous Andy to take over her old job. Emily's year-end perk of attending the Paris couture shows is contingent on Andy's being able to keep it, and the precariousness of the situation turns her into a font of wry despair. (When Miranda's driver text-messages Emily to inform her that Miranda will be arriving at the office earlier than expected because her facialist has ruptured a disc, a frazzled Emily moans, "God, these people!" )
 
  Runway's witty, soul-dead art director Nigel (Stanley Tucci) may be a sellout, but he's still more nuanced and compelling than the New Yorker-fixated Andy, whose idealism betrays equal doses of snobbery, cluelessness and entitlement. Her boyfriend (wisely downgraded from saintly inner-city teacher to moral-relativist sous-chef, and played by the scruffy Adrian Grenier) is supportive of the gig, but even though he agrees with Andy that she's destined for Greater Things, part of him wishes she would face up to her moral compromises and stop playing the victim.
 
  Greater Things don't often come with free $700 shoes, however, and Andy finds herself slowly sucked into the world of Runway. If Weisberger's novel focuses obsessively on every sharp word and withering glance her evil dragon-lady boss ever threw her way, the movie lets us in on what keeps her there.
 
  As tiresome as luxury-label name-dropping is in print, it's another thing entirely on film. The idea that the Runway girls starve, suffer and otherwise mortify their flesh to "deserve" the clothes that flow from Runway's fashion closet — depicted here as a glowing temple to couture — is a lot less mysterious after you get a glimpse of its contents.
 
  But there's more to it than that. Despite what she thinks, not even Andy is immune to Miranda's punishing allure. As Nate points out after Andy breaks one too many dates, invoking the "I had no choice" defense for the umpteenth time, he reminds her that the person whose phone calls you always take is the person you're in a relationship with. There's a fine line between love and hate, and anyone but a fool could tell that Andy is starting to cross it.
 
  Directed by David Frankel and written by Aline Brosh McKenna (with uncredited revisions by Don Roos and Paul Rudnick), "The Devil Wears Prada" spins Weisberger's rant into a sharp, surprisingly funny excursion into the catty realm of women's magazines. The movie skips the condescension usually aimed at this world in favor of rapt observation.
 
  The result may be shallow, but it's anything but cheap. From the opening montage, which juxtaposes the highly ritualized morning toilettes of Andy's soon-to-be colleagues with her own careless ablutions, it's clear that Andy is out of her league. The Runway girls — or "clackers," as Andy calls them, for the sound their stilettos make in the building's lobby — measure cereal and count their almonds while Andy inhales an abundantly schmeared onion bagel on her way to the office. It's the sort of detail that could have functioned as proof of Andy's sanity in an insane world, but if the movie knows one thing, it's that one person's normal is another's pathetically out of touch.
 
  The subculture at Runway may be venal and heartless, but it's also consensual. (In a great bit of casting, the editorial lackeys at Runway are played by famous fashion models, including Gisele Bündchen as Miranda's former first assistant, recently promoted.) And the fact that the movie understands the game makes everyone look a little better. The defining characteristic of Runway, after all, is not shallowness but cutthroat ambition and virulent aestheticism metastasized out of control. Miranda may be a harpy, but she's also cunning, ruthless, disciplined and not always wrong.
 
  Andy's resistance eventually gives way as she succumbs to the many pleasures of life at Runway — carte blanche to hate her boss being high among them. The movie's smartest departure from the book is that the script grants Andy the chance to understand how complex her fixation is.
 
  That she doesn't ultimately choose to cleave herself to Miranda comes as no surprise — in the mythology of the female coming-of-age story, virtue always wins out.
 
  What is unexpected here is that the triumph of virtue — with its attendant reversion to a Gap wardrobe — doesn't feel entirely triumphant. It smacks of giving up.

 In general release.   

As legendary Vogue  editor Diana Vreeland used to say in the era before daunting editor Anna Wintour, who inspired the character of terrifying editor Miranda Priestly, who, in the yummy, carb-lite fashion-world fantasy The Devil Wears Prada , rules the fictitious magazine Runway  like a magnificently cruel empress  well, as DV used to say, People Are Talking About...Meryl Streep.
Streep is Priestly, and I mean that from the topmost swoop of her divine, leonine silver coif to the polished tip of her pointiest Manolo. As she throws her PETA-disapproved fur jackets around, she exudes fearsome power with every shriveling glance she tosses over the tops of her reading glasses, every despotic command she murmurs. Streep has noodled around with comedy before  air kisses are in order for her great silliness in the Lemony Snicket movie, and her hilarious ballbusting in the remake of The Manchurian Candidate . But we haven't seen our Meryl like this until now, relishing the role as if it were the swellest Best of Everything achievement award a 13-time Oscar nominee could receive.
And it is. Lording it over rosebud-pretty Anne Hathaway as Andrea ''Andy'' Sachs, a new assistant spectacularly (and sitcom-ly) wrong for the job (Downy-fresh Andy's got no interest in fashion, has never heard of Miranda Priestly, and wishes she were doing Important Journalism at The New Yorker ), the seasoned star gently, graciously, and firmly steals the picture away from her younger colleague. For which thanks are due. It's not that Hathaway isn't gorgeous, a vision of ruby lips and brunet go-go bangs, her pony figure swathed in the killer wardrobe Andy learns to appreciate. But because Andy is such an impossible construct  a girl too pretty to have badness stick to her, a manipulative innocent  the whole giddy premise teeters on suspended disbelief as if on a skyscraper-high stiletto heel.
Who am I kidding? The story is glossy junk begat of just-plain junk anyway: Lauren Weisberger, who wrote the hiss-and-tell roman à clef best-seller on which the picture is based, was herself an assistant to Wintour, and her novel is greasy with pride in her own ''integrity'' and disdain for both her boss and the magazine whose paychecks she was presumably not forced at gunpoint to collect. The movie Prada , directed by HBO regular David Frankel (he's helmed Entourage , which helps explain Adrian Grenier's appearance as Andy's true-blue boyfriend), defangs most of Weisberger's crass opportunistic glee, but the whole thing is still more of a pop-culture sow's ear than a Fendi purse, with the laugh-out-loud spangly bits more likely the detail work of uncredited funny fellows like Paul Rudnick than the sensibility of credited screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna (Laws of Attraction ). Blameless Andy is first too pure for the Priestly cult, then seduced, then pure again at the end, only with a better wardrobe? Whatever, sister  it's Streep who pops our flashbulbs.

 NO man is a hero to his valet. So the saying goes, or used to go, since few men these days actually have valets. But a great many people, men and women alike, heroic at least in their own estimation, have assistants, who scurry after coffee and dry cleaning, endure bursts of foul temper, bask in tiny glimmers of generosity and dream, for long hours at low wages, of revenge. For the legions who have suffered the caprice and cruelty of a tyrannical boss, "The Devil Wears Prada," Lauren Weisberger's best-selling roman à clef about a bright young woman's brief period of servitude at a fashion magazine, provides the satisfaction of vicarious payback. Its portrait of Miranda Priestly, the imperious editor of a glossy rag called Runway, is a collage of unforgiven slights and unforgotten grudges, glued to the page with pure, righteous venom.  Ms. Weisberger's moral was simple, and hard to dispute: Nobody, however glamorous, successful or celebrated, has the right to treat another person the way Miranda treats her assistants, in particular the narrator, an eager Ivy Leaguer named Andy (short for Andrea) Sachs. But now that "The Devil Wears Prada" is a movie, starring Anne Hathaway as Andy, the lesson is not quite so unambiguous.  I will leave the business of point-by-point comparison to scholars, who will duly note that the screenwriter, Aline Brosh McKenna, and the director, David Frankel, have reimagined a few characters, discarded some plot developments and implanted others, and switched Andy's alma mater from Brown to Northwestern. When these specialists convene a learned panel to discuss their findings, a vigorous debate is likely to emerge. Does the movie, especially in the way it imagines Miranda, betray the novel or correct it?  The literary Miranda is a monster. Ms. Weisberger, restricting herself to Andy's point of view and no doubt giving voice to her own loathing of the real-life editor on whom Miranda is modeled, resisted the temptation to make her villain a complex (or even a terribly interesting) character. But the screen Miranda is played by Meryl Streep, an actress who carries nuance in her every pore, and who endows even her lighthearted comic roles with a rich implication of inner life. With her silver hair and pale skin, her whispery diction as perfect as her posture, Ms. Streep's Miranda inspires both terror and a measure of awe. No longer simply the incarnation of evil, she is now a vision of aristocratic, purposeful and surprisingly human grace.  And the movie, while noting that she can be sadistic, inconsiderate and manipulative, is unmistakably on Miranda's side. How, really, could it be otherwise? In Hollywood, for one thing, an abused assistant is, like a Toyota Prius, an indispensable accessory — an entitlement, really — for anyone who even wants to seem powerful.  And while the film makes some gestures of sympathy toward the underlings, it does not stray too far into class-conscious hypocrisy. Quite the contrary. It is a movie unapologetically, or maybe semi-apologetically, fascinated with power. The worlds of high fashion and slick journalism, a convenient backdrop for Ms. Weisberger's Gothic fable of captive innocence, are here held up for knowing, fetishistic delectation.  In this version the vicarious thrill is not payback but rather conspicuous consumption: all those lovingly photographed outfits and accessories, those warehouses' worth of Chanel and Jimmy Choo, those skinny women decked out (by the tirelessly inventive Patricia Field) in expensive finery. "The Devil Wears Prada" does exactly what the real-life counterparts of Runway magazine do every month, which is to deliver the most sumptuous goods imaginable — or fantasy images of them, in any case — to the eager eyes of the masses.  And why not? Mr. Frankel, who directed many episodes of "Sex and the City" (and who is a son of Max Frankel, a former executive editor of The New York Times), knows just how to infuse a spectacle of refinement and exclusivity with a feeling of democratic good cheer. He and Ms. McKenna also know how to mock without sneering, and how to acknowledge that fashion is a serious business without taking it too seriously.    Several carefully staged, pointedly written scenes defend Miranda on feminist grounds. Other moments reveal her vulnerability, and she occasionally takes time from her daily routine of spreading fear and anxiety wherever she goes to extend meaningful and sympathetic glances in Andy's direction. She also explains that while her kingdom of couture may seem like a shallow and trivial place, it is also a domain where power, money and art commingle to influence the choices and aspirations of women everywhere.  Andy may think that her drab blue cable-knit sweater is an emblem of virtue, a sign that she can't be bothered with the superficial obsessions that drive Runway, but Miranda insists otherwise, and the movie supports her view. Further tributes to Miranda's genius — and to the glorious tradition of journalism she represents — are offered by Nigel (Stanley Tucci), her loyal lieutenant, who becomes Andy's friend and protector.  That awful sweater is soon replaced by a series of glorious ensembles presented in one of many swirling, breathless montage sequences, all of which drive home the point that fabulous clothes are, well, fabulous. And who will argue? A few people try, notably Andy's boyfriend, Nate (Adrian Grenier), an aspiring chef who mopes into view every now and then to remind her that she's losing sight of the things that really matter. Tell it to Gourmet, pal.  Mr. Grenier, who effortlessly incarnates the shallow hedonism of the celebrity culture every Sunday night on "Entourage," is maybe not the best guy to be giving lectures about the ultimate hollowness of fashion and fame. And in any case Nate doesn't seem to mind the sexy lingerie that Andy brings home from the office.  The scenes in which Andy is warned that she is straying from her down-to-earth, nice-girl values are flimsy to the point of insincerity. And Ms. Hathaway, even made over with shiny bangs, flawless makeup and toe-squeezing footwear, is nowhere near as interesting to watch as Mr. Tucci, who has never been better, or Ms. Streep, whose perfectionism has rarely seemed so apt. Nor, for that matter, does Ms. Hathaway hold the screen against Emily Blunt, the British actress ("My Summer of Love") whose portrayal of Emily, Miranda's senior minion and Andy's office rival, is a minor tour de force of smiling hostility.  Ms. Hathaway shakes off her blandness only toward the end, when, in a climactic trip to Paris, Andy is drawn perilously close to her boss's chilly flame, and where her intermittent flirtation with a rakish magazine writer (Simon Baker) gathers steam. But for most of the movie Andy is a cipher, whose function is to bring us closer to Miranda,  the devil we are, after all, dying to know. In the movies no valet can be a hero. And in "The Devil Wears Prada," it turns out, vengeance belongs to Miranda Priestly.  "The Devil Wears Prada" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has strong language and sexual situations.

While men in capes have been wrestling for audience attention, Meryl Streep has quietly established herself as queen of the summer, first with her delectable turn in "A Prairie Home Companion" and now with her breathtakingly underplayed performance in "The Devil Wears Prada." Streep single-handedly elevates this sitcomy but tolerably entertaining adaptation of Lauren Weisberger's bestselling 2003 roman a clef about a personal assistant's year of chic hell under the thumb of the dragon lady of the fashion world. Gutsily being opened as counterprogramming to "Superman Returns," Fox release will play very well to women of all ages and should show off nice B.O. legs throughout the summer.
Weisberger's popular tome offered parsimonious bites of drama along with an array of tiresomely cliched supporting characters, but got by as a compendium of jaw-dropping workplace outrages perpetrated by an inhumanly monstrous boss; it didn't hurt that the author had worked for the famous and infamous editor of the world's best known fashion magazine.
To give the material more narrative shape, screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna ("Laws of Attraction") has minimized useless characters, expanded the boss's role to provide a speck of humanity and upped the dramatic ante with a couple of twists that render the tale less flat. Filmmakers have also toned down the editor's most extremely sadistic behavior and removed the explicitly Jewish identities of the two leads.
Providing an easy point of identification is Andy Sachs (Anne Hathaway), a recent Northwestern grad whose good looks are readily apparent to scruffily sweet-faced b.f. Nate (Adrian Grenier), but whose dorky bookworm wardrobe provokes guffaws when she arrives at Runway magazine for a job interview to become assistant to style doyenne Miranda Priestly (Streep).
Perhaps because she couldn't care less about fashion and has never heard of Miranda, Andy unexpectedly gets "the job a million girls would die for." She shares an outer office with brittle Brit Emily (Emily Blunt), who provides the newcomer with a few clues about what's required and how not to get fired.
As with the book, a good part of the film is devoted to detailing Miranda's reign of terror and the often unconscionable humiliations she visits upon her staff. This material, after all, reps the meat of the story, the inside stuff that feels like secrets revealed by someone with first-hand experience. Viewers are readily turned into wide-eyed voyeurs at the scene of daily worker panic and agony, as Miranda, as tough as any boot camp sergeant, calls size-six Andy fat, insists her coffees and lunches be delivered five minutes ago, demands a manuscript of the new Harry Potter book for her twin daughters even though it hasn't been published yet and concludes every encounter with a cutting "That's all."
As harsh as Miranda is in the film, her meanness has been scaled back from the off-the-charts levels of the book; Weisberger, viewing her with the one-dimensional horror of a terrified employee, portrayed her boss as a monster unleavened by any quality other than professional effectiveness. The film takes a slightly, but gratifyingly more expansive view of Miranda as a woman who has consciously made enormous sacrifices to get where she is and to maintain her power.
Aiding this effort most of all is Streep. What the book's Miranda achieves with hysteria and frequent screeching outbursts, the film's Miranda manages with withering glances and devastatingly dismissive looks that could wilt poison ivy. Streep's silent reactions are priceless, and when the lady does speak, it is in dulcet tones that demand extra attentiveness but then reward the listener with barbs from hidden needles. Coutured to the nines and a vision in platinum gray, Streep is a wonder.
Otherwise, the film clunks along through this year-in-the-life in fits and starts. It's amusing to observe Runway's fashion queen Nigel (Stanley Tucci, very good) setting Andy on a path toward a classy wardrobe, and heartening to watch Andy as she occasionally racks up points by anticipating Miranda's needs.
On the other hand, director David Frankel, who has trod these neighborhoods before while helming "Sex and the City," lards the proceedings with far too many klutzy montages papered over by a largely irritating selection of pop tunes. Scenes with Andy's earnest puppy-dog boyfriend are boringly one-note, meant to illustrate her growing distance from values of the heart, while the character of a predatory new candidate for Andy's attentions (Simon Baker) has been blanded out by removing his danger quotient.
Hathaway is fine as the smart but green young woman who finally becomes so good at her thankless job that she comes perilously close to going over to the "dark side" repped by Miranda. Also impressing is Blunt ("My Summer of Love") as Miranda's more senior assistant, whose emotional, physical and psychic deterioration over the course of the year presents the most vivid manifestation of Miranda's toxic influence.
More time could have been spent evoking the color and wild characters of the fashion scene, something achieved momentarily when the action moves to Paris in the late going. All the same, individual craft achievements are sharp, notably those by lenser Florian Ballhaus, production designer Jess Gonchor and, perhaps above all, costume designer Patricia Field ("Sex and the City"), who has turned out myriad appropriately stunning outfits for the entire cast.

Clocking in at 157 minutes and shackled to one of the clunkiest mythologies in American pop culture, Superman Returns  is surprisingly buoyant. The movie may not be a single-bound building-leaper but Bryan Singer  reconfigures the daddy of all comic-book sagas into something knowing, witty, and even sensitive.
Not that Superman Returns  lacks a camp appreciation for its material: Singer opens one dark and stormy night with a dying old lady (Noel Neill , the Lois Lane  of the '40s serials) leaving her billions to an attentive young paramour: "I love you, Lex Luthor ," she gasps with her final breath. Triumphant, he tosses off his wig . . . Meanwhile, somewhere in the American heartland, another elderly woman (Eva Marie Saint ) sadly gazes out her window. Then the fire-ship crash-lands and a naked man catapults into the cornfield. "Clark!!??" she quavers hopefully. Her son is back and if you don't know what I'm talking about you can march on over to Homeland Security and surrender your green card right now.
As evil genius Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey ) and his moll Kitty (Parker Posey  in a Betty Boop  wig) penetrate Superman's abandoned Fortress of Solitude (an ice palace designed by Albert Speer ) to learn the secrets of the universe (it's crystal), Clark "Superman" Kent (newcomer Brandon Routh ) returns from a five-year sabbatical to his job at the Daily Planet . There he discovers that his erstwhile colleague and heartthrob Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth ) is a Pulitzer laureate, for her article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman," and perhaps not coincidentally, the mother of an asthmatic little boy.
Tense and brittle, Lois has moved on. Superman, however, still has a job to do. He'll catch a crashing plane as it hurtles to earth and stop a bullet fired point-blank at his baby-blue eyes. Nonstop urban catastrophes allow Superman to zip hither and thither, dousing geysers of flame with his super breath, but he also makes time to take Lois flying. Square-jawed and clean-cut, Routh has a tender open gaze with occasional intimations of X-ray vision; he admits to being an inadvertent spy ("I hear everything") and is more than a bit vulnerable. Late in the day, Singer contrives to have him plunge from the heavens, accompanied by fake Wagner, his arms outstretched like a dying angel (to land, still splayed, in the ER).
With his two X-Men movies, Singer had multiple misfit personalities to play with. Here, the Michael DoughertyDan Harris  script supplies only one actually two (or maybe three, given Lois's willful inability to recognize Clark Kent  as Superman). But, as Superman does his best to pass for normal, Spacey's Lex Luthor becomes a super-necessity. The pleasure he takes in trilling "kr-r-ryptoni-i-i-ite" is compounded by the cold sexual enjoyment he projects watching the weakened Man of Steel being stomped.
Stressing his protagonist's suffering and resurrection, Singer flirts with the idea of a post-Passion  superhero. Why not? Invented in the 1930s by a pair of Jewish kids from Cleveland, Superman shares a common heritage with Jesus Christ  and is no less universal. "Three things sell papers," Planet  editor Perry White  (Frank Langella ) informs Lois, "tragedy, sex, and Superman." Metonym for the movies, Superman goes everywherethe Planet  newsroom monitors his exploits as simultaneously reported around the worldespecially Germany. Singer's pulp fictions regularly reference the Holocaust, and here Superman's return to Krypton suggests a heritage tour to Poland : "That place was a graveyard," he tells his adoptive mother. "I'm all that's left." Prominently placed in the "Metropolis "-establishing shot, just south of the absent WTC, is that monument to exile, the Museum of Jewish Heritage .
Other religions are acknowledged too (Luthor dares imagine himself the new Prometheus) although there's not much lip service paid to "truth, justice, and the American way." Still, by the time the movie ends with Superman treading air outside Lois's window, the Last Son of Krypton has established himself as a complete Trinity. He's the father and the son and, hovering over Lois and child, something of an eternal spirit. "I'm always around," he assures herjust as long as there's sex, tragedy, and papers to sell.

If the Holy Ghost favors a vulcanized rubber cape this season, the Devil may as well wear Prada . Improving on Lauren Weisberger 's bestselling roman à clefinspired by her stint as assistant to Vogue   editor Anna Wintour The Devil Wears Prada  recounts the adventures of a young Lois Lane in thrall to superwoman Miranda Priestly  (Meryl Streep ), fearsome editrix of Runway magazine.
Andy Sachs  (Anne Hathaway ), a recent J-school grad who, knowing nothing about fashion, gets flukishly hired to be Miranda's flunky, is constantly told that "a million girls would kill for her job." Kill  is the operative word. A onetime journalist from a newspaper family, director David Frankel  establishes Runway's atmosphere of total terrorsecond only to Stalin's court. Andy works for the most demanding, judgmental boss in the history of the 40-hour week. Always on call, she's allowed 15 minutes for lunch and assigned tasks beyond the Twelve Labors of Herculesinstantly obtaining a pre-pub copy of the new Harry Potter  novel or finding her mistress a flight out of Miami mid-hurricane. "It's some absurd weather problem," Miranda imperiously informs her.
