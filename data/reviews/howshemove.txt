Minus any telltale punctuation, one may not initially know how to read the title � is it a question? a warning? a declaration of intent? � but once the feet start flying in this Canadian film about step dancing, any numskull can finish the sentence: She move something fierce. But we�ll get to that. In an awkward opening narration, Raya (Wesley) lays it out for us: Her family�s savings have been wiped out in an unsuccessful attempt to get her older sister clean, forcing Raya to leave her tony boarding school and rejoin her Jamaican-born parents back in the projects. Raya isn�t happy to be home, and neither is her old crowd: Turns out she lit out of the neighborhood fast and burned a few bridges along the way. Some people, at least, remember her fondly, like Bishop (Murphy), who runs an underdog step crew (the film introduces him midperformance, his step keeping time to the apropos refrain "I Love My Boots�; should the film�s current title not translate internationally, I suggest I Love My Boots
 as a more-than-adequate substitute). Raya shrugs off his advances; at first glance, she seems a serious, maybe humorless, girl who looks far younger than her years. Looks are deceiving � when a rival girl challenges her to a step battle, Raya drops her jacket and goes to town. Sure, she gets schooled, but so it goes in any competition film � you gotta start at the bottom and climb your way up. How She Move
 hits most every beat the genre has to offer, even borrowing a few moves along the way (the ripping-off of a rival�s routine also figured prominently in Bring It On
). In short, there aren�t many surprises here, and even if there were, they�d be low-lit and fuzzy (How She Move
, which screened at last year's Sundance, wears its low budget on its sleeve; the upshot is a cast of unknowns who are naturals). Following the genre�s natural trajectory, this one culminates in Raya and Bishop teaming up for the annual Stepmonster Competition in Detroit, where the competition flies fast and furious in a montage that accents step�s astonishing meld of artistry and brute physicality (although any highlight reel must begin and end with a glorious slow pan of denim-clad booty). This kind of a dance film lives and dies by the routines, and this one wins: Mixing elements of gymnastics, karate, and break with the almighty step � an exceedingly polite term for what is really an awesome stomp � the dance sequences will root out the beat in even the sorriest Bandstand
 bystander � although, manifest in this white-girl wallflower, the beat resembled nothing so much as restless legs syndrome. We can�t all
 move something fierce, you know.


How many times can you watch the same movie with different actors and a new title? If it's a dance musical and the dancing's good, the answer's obvious: As many times as they can keep cranking 'em out. No one went to see Astaire-Rogers movies for the plots, and no kid is going to go to "How She Move" for its hackneyed inspirational story line about an inner-city good girl who wants to step bad. When the cast starts clomping atop a car, their synchronized bodies joining with the booming cross-rhythms, we're sold.
A Canadian-made independent that first surfaced at last year's Sundance, "How She Move" is a grittier, slightly more real-world version of movies like "Step Up," "Stomp the Yard," and "Save the Last Dance." The lead female is black, for one thing, and the setting in Toronto's Jane-Finch Corridor is believably plagued with violence and believably inhabited by people trying to rise above it.
Raya (Rutina Wesley) had escaped the blight by attending a private school, but her late sister's drug addiction has sapped the family finances. That puts the girl back in the neighborhood, desperately cramming for an exam that would guarantee a scholarship and get her on track once more toward med school. Raya also has a gift for step-dancing and eyes the local crews with a mixture of envy, ambition, and unease.
Writer Annmarie Morais and director Ian Iqbal Rashid work enough variations on the old cliches to keep the early scenes interesting. The local bad girl, Michelle (Tré Armstrong), looks set to beat Raya down, but they end up having a furious dance-off, then become wary study partners. There's a hint of romance with Bishop (Dwain Murphy), the sweetie-pie leader of the J Street Junta dance crew, but it stays just that - a hint. Girl's gotta dance, and if it's as part of Bishop's all-male troupe, all the better.
On the other side of the aisle, there are such shopworn notions as the nerd who's secretly a great choreographer (Brennan Gademans), the disapproving mom (Melanie Nicholls-King of "The Wire") who comes around in the last reel, the rival crew led by the villainous Garvey (Clé Bennett), and the climactic "Step Monster" contest emceed by real-life notables (singer Keyshia Cole and actor/"comedian" DeRay Davis).
Oh, who cares how we got here - the competition's a gas, with the various crews dressed in street clothes or matching suits, using props or their own limber bodies, combining and recombining with percussive, mesmerizing force. The choreographer is a woman named HiHat - she's done a lot of Missy Elliot videos and the upcoming "Step Up" sequel - and it's possible she's the real star of "How She Move."
Still, Wesley has a fierce presence as Raya, trying to decide how much she owes herself and how much she owes her community. If that gives the kids in the audience something to chew on, great. The rest we've all seen before, but when the feet hit the floor, we don't begrudge seeing it again.


She move good! The specificity of Caribbean-Canadian life in a low-income, multiethnic Toronto neighborhood gives How She Move , a pleasantly conventional story of striving and step dancing, its flavor. Plus, the moves  more gymnastically hybrid than those in Stomp the Yard   are fierce, especially as set to a pounding soundtrack by Missy Elliott and Busta Rhymes, among others. Rutina Wesley glowers with just the right touch of sweetness as a brainy student (and stellar after-school stepper) who needs to learn how to honor her old hood even as she studies hard to move on out.

 “How She Move,” a feature by the director Ian Iqbal Rashid (“Touch of Pink”) about a disaffected young woman competing in dance contests, is the latest incarnation of the up-by-your-bootstraps musical drama. There’s nary a twist you don’t see coming. But the film’s strong acting, spectacular dance routines and culturally specific details turn clichés into catharsis. It’s the sort of film that sends you home with a spring in your step.  Rutina Wesley, a recent Juilliard graduate, stars as Raya, a young woman from Jane-Finch Corridor, a multiethnic part of Toronto. Raya, the descendant of Caribbean immigrants, who excels both at academics and stepping, an acrobatic form of dance that uses hands, feet and sometimes props as percussive instruments.  She left her neighborhood to attend private school, but blew a scholarship qualifying exam (a setback she has kept secret). Now she’s a sullen loner who clashes with nearly everyone, including a longtime friend named Michelle (Tré Armstrong), a stepper and troubled student who accuses Raya of being a cultural traitor and “slumming.”  The truth is, Raya had good reason to choke during that big test. Her beloved older sister — a local legend in stepping contests, briefly glimpsed in flashbacks dancing with a preadolescent Raya — had recently died from a drug overdose. To the film’s credit this tragedy, which would have been an arbitrary tear-jerking touch in other movies, hangs over every frame, even in fleeting details, like the shot of Raya reading “Jane Eyre.”  Raya gets a chance to return to private school courtesy of a local stepping contest with a $50,000 top prize. She’s good enough to dance with any team, and she’s ruthless in her choice. She considers joining Michelle’s team, then hooks up with one run by a male friend (and potential beau) named Bishop (Dwain Murphy), because, as the script makes clear, the world of stepping is intensely sexist, segregating teams by gender and always awarding the top prize to male teams. (The screenwriter, Annmarie Morais, herself a descendant of Caribbean immigrants in Toronto, embroiders the story with details that feel lived rather than researched.)  If you’ve ever seen a film before, you know that Raya will repeatedly clash with Bishop, go over to a rival squad and return to Bishop’s side for a triumphant finale. You also know that she will flagrantly disregard the angry warnings of her academically minded mom (a heart-wrenching Melanie Nicholls-King) and concentrate on dance at the expense of schoolwork. And that when she inevitably wins the big prize, her mother will be there and have a change of heart.  It is, in short, the kind of movie that sinks or swims on its performances and atmosphere. “How She Move” is aces in both departments, from its magnetic cast of skilled dancer-actors to its script, which alternates eloquently rough (yet rarely profane) zingers with exchanges that strengthen the film’s themes while further defining its smart, striving characters.  “They’ve got ninth graders reading Tolstoy?” Raya asks, spying a book in the hands of Bishop’s fleet-footed teammate and kid brother, Quake (Brennan Gademans).  “They’ve got ninth graders reading ‘Death of a Salesman,’ ” Quake replies. “I’m reading Tolstoy.

Fans of the vigorous African-American step dancing currently on offer in B.O. hit "Stomp the Yard" should check out its Caribbean-Canadian counterpart in "How She Move." Title refers not only to its heroine's physical gyrations but also her moral maneuverings as she strives to break out of her lower-class surroundings in this moody, intelligent take on conventional material. Emphasis on the pic's electrifying dance sequences could help carve out a small commercial niche for the Paramount Vantage release.
Like "Stomp the Yard," "How She Move" inflicts the death of a sibling on its protagonist that haunts her and informs her choices for the duration of the picture. A brilliant student and gifted dancer, Raya Green (Rutina Wesley) is still grieving for her older sister, whose death from a drug overdose decimated her family's finances and forced her to leave her elite prep school.
Returning to public school in Toronto's gritty Jane-Finch corridor, Raya has a tense reunion with tough girl Michelle (Tre Armstrong), who attacks Raya for being a stuck-up poser even as she drifts further into the drugs-and-partying scene that claimed her sister's life. The bad blood between Raya and Michelle leads to the first of several impromptu dance-offs, which open Raya to the possibility of using her step skills to get ahead.
Already flirting with good-looking Bishop (Dwain Murphy), Raya talks him into letting her join JSJ, their all-male troupe that's hoping to win a competition with a major cash prize. Not dissimilar to 2000 Sundance fave "Girlfight," the pic is very much about a tough girl's struggle to succeed in a male-dominated arena.
Steeped in the accents of Toronto's Caribbean community, Annmarie Morais' script also gives Raya some questionable choices -- at one point leaving JSJ to join a more seasoned troupe -- that are meant to dramatize her desire to get ahead at any cost, but which, despite Wesley's strong performance, don't always feel organically developed.
At the same time, the tale has a gratifying untidiness as it casually addresses themes of class, sexism, drug use and the relentless drive to succeed. "How She Move" is also deeply invested in relationships, most rewardingly the interplay of anger and sympathy between Raya and Michelle, and also Raya's dealings with her laid-back dad (Conrad Coates) and anxious mom (Melanie Nicholls-King, who gives an indelibly moving turn in a small role).
Helmer Ian Iqbal Rashid (whose debut feature "Touch of Pink" preemed at Sundance in 2004) infuses the production with a grit and weightiness that never feel overdone, and his most dramatically effective moments -- including the unexpectedly resonant ending -- are often the quietest. The hugely enjoyable dance sequences (spectacularly choreographed by Hi Hat) give the pic a regular jolt of energy, though some of the more elaborate formations could have benefited from a widescreen frame.

High School Musical  excepted, dance figures now in teen movies mostly as competitive sport: Either it's an NBA-like ticket out, as in Save the Last Dance , or it's an NFL-like face-off, as in Stomp the Yard . In this diverting Canadian drama, it's both: The big-money pay-off to a step-dancing contest lures a studious inner-city girl (Rutina Wesley ) to join an all-male neighborhood dance crew, in hopes of getting the private-school tuition her working-poor Jamaican parents can't afford. For once, the moviewritten by Annmarie Morais  and directed by Ian Iqbal Rashid  (Touch of Pink ) with a gritty overlay of 16mm grainregards book learning as at least as important as physical prowess. Wesley's tenacious heroine embodies this, as does her crew captain's day-saving little brother (Brennan Gademans ), a bespectacled sharpie who proves as well-versed in move-bustin' as he is in Tolstoy. Apart from the exuberant athleticism of the step battleschoreographed by Hi-Hat with equal room for grace, physical wit, and aggression, if not always sympathetically shot or editedthe movie's chief appeal is a largely unknown cast. Especially good are Wesley, whose expressions are a study in shifting thought, and Tre Armstrong  as her street-hardened but good-hearted rival, a stock role that Armstrong fills with unmediated feeling.
