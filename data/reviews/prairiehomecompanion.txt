It's been a very long time since any Robert Altman film has been as enjoyable as A Prairie Home Companion
. Sure, Altman turned in a couple of nice movies with Cookie's Fortune
 and Gosford Park
, but those films have scripts so solid they could have been directed by just about any competent director and probably delivered the same agreeable results. Altman's recent forays into more abstract ensemble subjects � like Pr�t-�-Porter
, Kansas City
, and Dr. T and the Women
 � have all been creative failures that never located their disparate subjects with any precision and displayed no evident love for their characters. What's absent in A Prairie Home Companion
 is exactly what makes this Altman film so terrific. Gone is the director's dyspeptic world view and deep disdain for his characters. Whether this shift is due to the director's personal evolution or the serendipitous pairing of Altman with fellow Midwesterner Garrison Keillor remains for future films to tell. Nevertheless, the combination of Keillor's invented radio community of A Prairie Home Companion
, which he's perfected over the years through the show's public radio broadcasts and now with this film script (whose story he concocted with Ken LaZebnik), and Altman's roving camera eye, which in pausing to focus on an individual homes in on the gestalt, makes for a delightful movie experience. We had a glimpse of this film's workings during the introduction of Altman by Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin at this year's Academy Awards ceremony before receiving his Lifetime Achievement award. Their daffy routine in which they stepped all over each other's words was a prelude to their singing sister act in the film as Yolanda and Rhonda Johnson � stalwarts among the radio show's many troupers. The film is fashioned in the vein of a backstage musical. But for a brief opening scene and epilogue set in the neon-lit diner across the street from the theatre in St. Paul, the action of A Prairie Home Companion
 all takes place during the last-ever presentation of the show�s live radio performance. This kind of live radio fell out of favor decades ago, although this cornpone ensemble seems to be the last to receive the news. The station has been sold to a rich, heartless Texan (Tommy Lee Jones), and while the performers bemoan the end of the show and an era, their call to observe a moment of silence is met with refusal by G.K. (the host of the show, as Garrison Keillor is called here, and the shambling center of the action), who insists that a moment of silence on radio is simply dead air. Ed Lachman�s camera glides in and out of the dressing rooms and onstage, pausing here and there to focus on a character or bit of conversation. The characters are deliciously rich: There are the aforementioned Johnson girls, including Yolanda�s daughter Lola (Lohan, who holds her own quite capably), the lovable kings of bad jokes Dusty (Harrelson) and Lefty (O�Reilly); the cowboy balladeer Chuck Akers (L.Q. Jones); the suave but bumbling detective Guy Noir (Kline), and the mysterious woman in a white trenchcoat (Madsen) who stalks the theatre. The film is rather skimpy in the plot department, however the fullness of the characters more than compensates for this omission. For A Prairie Home Companion
 is not really about anything that happens or is about to happen among these characters or because of the broadcast�s demise. Rather, it�s a testament to living in the moment and cherishing the joy of creation. At the age of 81, Altman may show signs of mellowing, but he again emerges as a master filmmaker.


Some early moments in Robert Altman's ``A Prairie Home Companion" suggest that the director is on one of the minor adventures that produces a dotty picture like 2000's ``Dr. T and the Women." But he and Garrison Keillor have turned Keillor's beloved radio show into the sort of backstage entertainment allegory that brings out the best in the director.
His 38th theatrical feature isn't as politically incisive as ``Nashville" nor as satirically vicious as ``The Player." What ``Prairie Home Companion" does, however, is bring us the 81-year-old Altman in a reflective state of mind.
Distilling the radio show to its live performances and homemade commercials, Altman and Keillor emphasize the melancholic undercurrents that flow through the airwaves during broadcasts of the show.
In doing so, these two Midwesterners make a surprisingly cozy pair. Altman's hostility would seem to short-circuit Keillor's earnestness. But neither man has much need for sentimentality or nostalgia. They've turned their collaboration into a pungent wake for a bygone era.
The film imagines the evening of the final live broadcast of ``Prairie Home." According to Keillor's script, the owners of the St. Paul, Minn., theater that puts on the show have sold it to a Texas corporation whose icy CEO (Tommy Lee Jones) watches from a skybox.
Backstage, entertainers and crew carry on unaware that the plug is soon to be pulled. They include the Johnson Sisters, Yolanda and Rhonda (Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin), who blow into their dressing room, dragging Yolanda's morbid daughter, Lola (Lindsay Lohan) behind them; and Dusty and Lefty, the sparring, folksy, and vulgar singing trail hands, played by Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly.
Altman integrates the performers and backstage personnel with his usual deceptive effortlessness. The small-scale mayhem feels firmly under control. The concerned makeup lady (Sue Scott), the neurotic stage manager (Tim Russell), the prankish, pregnant stagehand (Maya Rudolph), and the seasoned woman (Marylouise Burke) running the food stand and carrying on a lusty affair with one of the show's even more seasoned performers (L.Q. Jones): They all move seamlessly in and out of the story's focus. (Jacob Craycroft is the ace editor, and the great Edward Lachman shot the picture.)
Keillor plays the broadcast's narrator, G.K., whom Yolanda chides for being unfeeling. Indeed, Keillor's expressionless carriage really is made for radio. But his voice is something else. No one will hear a lovelier sound in a movie this year than his intoning the words ``rhubarb pie." His diction is so impeccable you can hear the ``h" and almost smell the pie.
The actors harmonize on stage and off with the energetic off-key idiosyncrasy that Altman prefers. Tomlin and Streep, who's busty and blowsy, have an amusing honey-and-vinegar rapport that even requires them to sing over each other. Lohan, meanwhile, can frequently be seen scribbling in a composition book. I can only hope she plans to use her notes to get herself into more movies this good.
The seemingly inessential character here is played by Kevin Kline. He wanders incongruously through the film, playing a hapless gumshoe who works as the backstage doorkeeper. He knows about the sale and spends the movie trying in his own inept fashion to save the station.
Kline's combination of pratfalls and urbanity is funny, but it rubs against the rest of the movie's effortless rustic charm. He's like Errol Flynn on a hayride.
But he does lust after the movie's best invention: Virginia Madsen, who wanders from scene to scene, luminously, in a white trench coat, playing an angel of death. Some characters can see her and some can't. Either way, her appearance here goes from silly to ethereal to utterly holy, transforming a trifle into a genuinely affecting movie.
Like ``Nashville," ``Prairie Home Companion" culminates in a jamboree. This one moves Tommy Lee Jones's character to observe that it makes him feel like an anthropologist who's discovered a lost tribe. He's not wrong. Before our eyes, it seems like a form of entertainment is dying right along with the people who make it.


         The end looms large in Robert Altman's "A Prairie Home Companion," which nevertheless takes its sweet time saying goodbye. Written by Garrison Keillor, creator and host of the long-running public radio show, the movie is a pretty curious artifact — a retraction of a send-up, in which Keillor's mild, pleased-with-itself spoof of old-time radio variety shows is recast as an actual old-time radio variety show. The audience filling the Fitzgerald theater in St. Paul in the movie doesn't appear that different from the ones who might fill it in real life or who tune in from the coasts. But the performers on stage — including a hangdog emcee known as G.K. (Keillor) — don't exactly look like NPR coffee-mug types. Most of them are shucksy and woebegone for real.
 
  Altman has made a long, varied career of peeking under the rug of various subcultures to reveal the underside of the weave. On the face of it, making a movie about "A Prairie Home Companion," a show that has run for 32 years, would seem to make sense. But far from taking a "Larry Sanders Show"-style approach, Keillor's script wants to be "interesting" more than it wants to be honest. Rather than focus on internecine rivalries, disconnects between the characters and the people who play them, etc., Keillor creates an alternative universe that resembles the fictional universe of his show. It's as if Restoration Hardware's marketing department woke up one day suddenly believing its own copy.
 


         






    The result is at once familiar and disconcerting, meta-Keillor done in Altman's desultory, distracted style. The formidable cast of characters fluttering around the imperturbable host includes Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin as sisters Yolanda (Streep) and Rhonda (Tomlin) Johnson, the last remaining members of a musical family whom Yolanda describes to her daughter Lola (Lindsay Lohan) as "the Carter family, only not famous"; a hard-boiled private detective Guy Noir (Kevin Kline) of the public radio show's occasional pulp fiction parody; Maya Rudolph as a put-upon assistant; and Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly as a duo of singing cowboys — characters who don't belong on the same plane of existence, let alone in the same movie.
 
  The gumshoe business not being what it used to be, Guy has taken a job doing security for the show. The movie takes place almost entirely within the confines of the theater on the night of the 30-year-old show's final broadcast, as the radio station has been bought by a Texas conglomerate run by Bible-thumping vulgarians — they've never even heard of F. Scott Fitzgerald — who plan to shut down the operation. While he's expecting "the Axeman" (Tommy Lee Jones) to make an appearance, Guy doesn't know what to make of the apparition in a white trench coat who shows up unannounced.
 
  Of course, no one expects the angel of death, especially not when she looks like Virginia Madsen. But that's what she is — the celestial continuation of a longtime "Prairie Home" listener who laughed at a joke, lost control of her car and died, come to escort an elderly cast member to the Lord.
 
  Altman uses his trademark wandering camera to mosey from character to character, pausing to watch and listen as they tease one another, reminisce about the old days, worry about the future and fart inappropriately. As Rhonda and Yolanda, Tomlin and Streep twitter and cluck and talk over each other, filling Lola in on their life and times. Lola, a poetry-writing smarty whose subject is suicide, listens patiently to stories about Wanda, whose Christian fans turned on her after she was arrested for shoplifting. She suffered an episode of hypoglycemia and forgot to pay for a doughnut. "If she were in a rock band," instead of a Christian group, "she could have thrown sofas out the window," Yolanda says. "But they'd just as soon kill you as look at you, some of those 'good people.' "
 
  Given their status as living anachronisms, it's natural that "A Prairie Home's" fictional characters would feel threatened with extinction. But the fear seems to come from an unusual source. Of all popular entertainment programs, surely "A Prairie Home Companion" has the least to fear from the nipple-censoring fundies, even if it is a bastion of Minnesotan liberalism. What's harder to figure is why the modern world Keillor and Altman have created — with its censoring Christians, philistine corporations and hysterical regulatory agencies — feels so old-fashioned and off the mark.
 
  If the real-life show on which the movie is based has managed to survive for 32 years, it likely has more to do with ratings than with its station's drive for cultural preservation. But the "Prairie Home Companion" of the movie is hardly the middlebrow juggernaut known to listeners. Instead it's been converted to kitsch museum, which might as well house a giant ball of string. The improvised patter is funny and sharp, the music kicky and the nods to fake sponsors familiar, but without Keillor's monologue and the show's collective inclusion on the joke, the movie falls into a strange nostalgia for something that hardly anyone remembers, if it ever really existed at all. Anyone who does 
remember is likely to be put off by the not-so-gentle ribbing of the opening credits. Over a picture of a country scene at dusk, an invisible hand fiddles with the radio dial, pausing to listen to farm reports, bellowing ministers, a country lady reciting a recipe that calls for cream of mushroom soup and egg noodles instead of the eye-talian ones. It's a little joke on the prairie, but who's laughing at whom?

In his great Nashville, Robert Altman mocked the country settings for their theme-park churchiness, but he knew that the musicians  like Ronee Blakley, with her tender twang of heartbreak  had a true spirit. They were humane and beautiful because they were so touchingly themselves. The performances in Altman's film of  A Prairie Home Companion  work the same way. This time, though, we're watching the funny, folksy equivalent of chamber music  the Grand Ole Opry in small-town miniature  and what's happening off stage is of no great consequence.
It merely decorates the show at its center. A Prairie Home Companion  is a minor bauble of an Altman movie, a lightly fictionalized version of Garrison Keillor's fabled public-radio variety show, which was first broadcast on July 6, 1974. The conceit is that we're watching the farewell performance of Prairie Home , which is portrayed not as the national phenomenon it has been for decades but merely as an obscure local concoction broadcast onto a single Minnesota station. Early on, Keillor, who's like the world's most whimsical undertaker, with prim pursed lips and a head shaped like a giant thumb, hangs out backstage, slipping on his suspendered pants and red sneakers and gabbing, in his soft quicksilver way, to one of the performers, Yolanda Johnson (Meryl Streep), about singing ''Gold Watch & Chain'' that evening. For a moment, they harmonize, and they're like birds lining up in the sky; it's comic how in sync they are, as if they'd never not  been singing that song. Later, between Keillor's soothing pre-media-age commercials for duct tape and Norwegian biscuits, they perform the number on stage, and what strikes you is how supremely lovely it is  this sweet, ticktock confession of romantic pain, delivered with no fuss, as if it were another commercial, a plug for the variety show that is life.
As everyone waits for the Axeman (Tommy Lee Jones), the movie begs to be taken for what it is: the radio show writ large. The film's minor delight is the way it frames and heightens what's special about A Prairie Home Companion   its celebration of idiosyncrasy in a world now ruled by corporate culture, with its packaged ''quirks'' (e.g., American Idol ). As the night rolls on, the spirit of the concert builds, from Streep and Lily Tomlin as the old-broad Johnson sisters to Tom Keith, the sound-effects guy, doing madcap miracles with his mouth; from Lindsay Lohan, as Streep's depressive-chic daughter, lending an appealing quaver to ''Frankie & Johnny,'' to cowboys Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly getting more laughs than you'd believe out of ''Bad Jokes.'' The group performance of ''Let Your Light Shine on Me'' has a gospel ecstasy. Altman, working from Keillor's wisp of a script, employs his fabled techniques  the improv babble, the camera zooms that seem to orbit a room  but there isn't a lot of drama to A Prairie Home Companion . What sustains the film is the performers' belief in their shaggy-dog selves, which is more than just talent  it's faith.

 A late, minor addition to the Robert Altman collection — but a treasure all the same — "A Prairie Home Companion" is more likely to inspire fondness than awe. This is entirely appropriate, since the movie snuggles deep into the mood and sensibility of its source, Garrison Keillor's long-running public radio variety show.  Beloved by tote-baggers across the land, Mr. Keillor's weekly cavalcade of wry Midwestern humor and musical Americana has never set out to make anyone's hair stand on end. Notwithstanding the occasional crackle of satire or sparkle of instrumental virtuosity, it mostly offers reliable doses of amusement embedded in easygoing nostalgia. It looks back on — or, rather, reinvents — a time when popular culture was spooned out in grange halls and Main Street movie palaces, and when broadcasting was supposedly a local affair sponsored by mom-and-pop purveyors of biscuits and Norwegian pickled herring.  In the film Mr. Keillor, who wrote the screenplay and also plays himself (as a jowly, owlish and curiously detached master of ceremonies), supplies the whimsy. Mr. Altman, a more cantankerous spirit (he comes from Kansas City, Mo., a wilder corner of the Midwest than Mr. Keillor's Minnesota), brings his unrivaled sense of chaos and his mischievous eye for human eccentricity. Together they have confected a breezy backstage comedy that is also a sly elegy:  a poignant contemplation of last things that goes down as smoothly and sweetly as a lemon drop.  The action takes place during the final performance of "A Prairie Home Companion," a live radio broadcast that, unlike its real world counterpart, is not made possible by the generous support of listeners like you. Its home station, WLT, has been gobbled up by a Texas-based chain and a corporate heavy, known only as the Axeman (Tommy Lee Jones), has been sent north to shut the program down.  Not everyone involved knows about this — and some who do know don't seem to care — but the show, in any case, goes on. As he has before — in "The Company," in "Ready to Wear" and in "Nashville," to name just a few — Mr. Altman shuttles his camera gracefully from the wings to the stage, so that you can't always tell where the performance ends and the buzz of regular life begins.  Shooting almost entirely within the Fitzgerald Theater, named for the author F. Scott,  in St. Paul, Mr. Altman observes the doings of a loose tribe of artists, technicians and hangers-on. The sometime-narrator is Guy Noir (Kevin Kline), a mainstay of the actual "Prairie Home Companion" here incarnated as a onetime private eye and part-time stage-door security guard. He is the first to notice the presence of a mysterious woman in white (Virginia Madsen), who turns out to be an angel and also the film's literal femme fatale.  As the show rambles through missed cues, heartfelt songs and semi-naughty jokes (courtesy of singing cowboys Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly), we become aware that death, actual and metaphorical, is hovering over the proceedings. Not everyone will survive the evening. Someone will murder a famous murder ballad. Inevitably, the house will go dark, and the players will leave the stage. And in the meantime, a moody young woman (Lindsay Lohan) writes poems about suicide.    But perhaps because of these intimations of mortality, you can't help but be amazed at just how much warm, exuberant life there is in this ramshackle, loose-limbed story. A stagehand (Maya Rudolph) is pregnant. One of the performers carries on a discreet December-December affair with the woman who hands out sandwiches. The Johnson Sisters (Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin) bicker, harmonize and reminisce about the old days. Mr. Keillor tells a few different versions of the shaggy-dog tale about how he got his start in radio, which has something to do with a riverboat and a naked man flying through the air attached to a kite.  The cast moves through it all with relaxed professionalism, making the whole production look as effortless as Mr. Altman's sauntering dolly shots or Mr. Keillor's mellow riffs on the virtues of ketchup, rhubarb and duct tape. If it sometimes seems to be on the verge of falling apart, that's the point. The film is,  partly, a protest against the smooth, standardized, bottom-line culture represented by the Axeman, and a defiant celebration of imperfection, improvisation and accident. Sometimes you forget a song lyric, your joke falls flat or you scatter the pages of your script all over the floor. Such mishaps occur frequently in "A Prairie Home Companion," and each one turns into a moment of grace. It's not a perfect movie, and it does not aspire to be a great one. It's just wonderful.  "A Prairie Home Companion" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some sexual humor and innuendo.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

Rib-ticklingly funny at times and genial as all get-out, Robert Altman's take on Garrison Keillor's three-decades-old Minnesota institution is about nothing more or less than the privileged musical and behavioral moments created by the engagingly diverse cast. The shambling, oddly diffident Keillor makes a curious central figure, and there are few if any recent precedents to indicate if a loyal radio audience will follow its enthusiasm from the airwaves to movie houses. But the "Prairie Home Companion" brand name and likely upbeat word-of-mouth should translate into nice specialized biz, with crossover to significant Middle American consumption possible if all the cards come up right for Picturehouse upon skedded June 9 release.
From a story he worked out with Ken LaZebnik, Keillor concocted the screenplay about a radio show very much like the one he's been broadcasting since July 1974 from St. Paul, Minn. With the exception of framing scenes at an Edward Hopperesque diner, entire pic takes place as the "fictional" show prepares for its final broadcast before its longtime home, the Fitzgerald Theater, is demolished by Texas real estate interests for Joni Mitchell's proverbial parking lot.
But no big deal is made of the occasion, as GK, as he's called, prefers to shuffle along as if it's just another program. With Edward Lachman's stealthy HD cameras constantly on the move, Altman follows the various participants on and backstage, capturing their quirks, preoccupations and agendas as their private and professional lives seamlessly mix.
It's an artistic scheme the director has used numerous times before, including in his films about other artistic milieu, such as "The Company" (dance), "Kansas City" (jazz), "Ready-to-Wear" (fashion), "The Player" (film), "Vincent & Theo" (painting) and "Nashville" (country music).
Altman's first significant professional job was as a radio writer, and while the film is scarcely concerned with craft and mechanics, there is a comfort with the setting that dovetails with the helmer's evident delight in the performers he's put in front of the camera; no trace here of the condescension that has sometimes marred his work.
Private detective Guy Noir is one of the "Companion's" memorable longtime characters, and here he's been slightly reimagined as a chronically underemployed investigator who handles security for the show. Wonderfully enacted by Kevin Kline in '40s threads and attitudes, Guy is supposed to keep an eye on things (while narrating the tale) but becomes distracted by a mysterious blonde (Virginia Madsen) who materializes to insinuate herself into the proceedings in unforeseeable ways.
Also carrying over from Keillor's actual show are cowboy crooners Dusty and Lefty (Woody Harrelson, John C. Reilly), whose ongoing banter culminates in a final number, "Bad Jokes," in which the off-color lyrics are indeed as bad as they are hilarious. Adding more down-home flavor is L.Q. Jones as a vet country singer.
But the most prominent singers here are Yolanda and Rhonda Johnson (Meryl Streep, Lily Tomlin), the surviving half of what used to be a promising quartet of sisters. In the company of Yolanda's teen daughter Lola (Lindsay Lohan), who writes suicide poetry, the two gals yack on in wacky ways about family, special memories and disappointments, one of which, for Yolanda, includes an aborted romance with GK; this story strand is understated in the extreme, but informs Streep's interactions with Keillor in a funny way.
So unhurried and distractible is GK that it seems a wonder that he can stay on top of all the demands of hosting the radio show. That he can is a tribute to his very pregnant assistant stage manager Molly (Maya Rudolph), for at the slightest provocation Keillor will launch into a story or anecdote that inevitably takes a while to tell. You might have to go back all the way to James Stewart to find a bigscreen antecedent for Keillor's folksy Midwestern manner and leisurely verbal style.
All through the show, GK refuses to acknowledge that it's the finale. "Every show's your last show. That's my philosophy," he explains. Nor will he mention it when one cast member dies offstage during the broadcast; "I don't do eulogies."
While these lines may well have come straight from Keillor, one can only imagine they have a special resonance for Altman, who was 80 when the film was shot, something the film's fleet style doesn't betray for a moment. The specter of death, or at least the end of something, hovers over the enterprise, but in the lightest possible way, as if to ignore it -- as GK ignores the theater's impending doom -- is the only possible policy.
The musical numbers are brief, spirited and thoroughly delightful, all backed by Keillor's actual house band. Tom Keith, his sound effects man, also gets the spotlight for a couple of diverting minutes.
Amusement comes from many sources, although first among equals are Kline, whose comic timing in an uproariously silly phone scene, is in a class comparable to Buster Keaton and Cary Grant, and Harrelson, who locks in a hitherto unknown dry drollness that lifts his every line.
Tommy Lee Jones turns up toward the end as the Texas "axe man" come to witness the final moments of the Fitzgerald (named for St. Paul's own F. Scott, a bust of whom Guy Noir scavenges as a keepsake).

Like the Grand Ole Opry  plopped into a fragrant barn at the county fair, Garrison Keillor 's A Prairie Home Companion  befits its roots in frosty Minnesota soil through its worldview, Buddhist by way of Scandinavia : Life is about suffering. The windchill is below zero and so is your spouse; bone-dry Pastor Ingqvist beats his pulpit and you take it like a slap in the face; the cows will make their mess, you'll clean it up, and they'll do it again, every day until, God willing, you die. No one in Keillor's Lake Wobegon actually complains (they persevere), and no one expects a miracle. Things can always get worse, and they dobut it'll be over soon enough. Rhubarb pie and a toe-tapping ditty about the basic unfairness (and occasional joys) of life at least help pass the time on long Saturday nights in front of the transistor radio.
Maybe Keillor was countering the counterculture by sending his first news from Lake Wobegon over the airwaves in the times-are-a-changin'-back year of 1974. Or maybe the emcee's playfully slippery tonealternately parodying and celebrating mid-American nostalgia for old-fashioned hard work, righteous self-pity, and what-the-hell-let's-strike-up-the-bandallowed that only our close attention to a speaker's nuances would prevent another Tricky Dick. (Is that condescension or inspiration in Keillor's mock-heroic lilt? Might it be both?) Whatever the case, the host's comically long-winded monologues on life in the invisibly small town have become damn near seditious in wartime. Here is the rare popular broadcaster who's dedicated to counting casualtiesnot just poor Junior overseas, but Mom and Pop and their corner store too.
Robert Altman 's A Prairie Home Companion  is something of a different story, even though Keillor wrote it (for the director's approval, of course). What the maker of Nashville  sees in the show, predictably, is not a self-made bandleader and oddball raconteur so much as another democratic ensemble of musicians and assorted stagehands who come together in the service of maintaining their insular artists' colony in an inhospitable climate. Tellingly, Altman never shows the audience: For this gently fictionalized backstage musical set at the show's real home in St. Paul, Minnesota, the audience is Robert Altman, and so is the master of ceremonies. Keillor, clad in trademark suit and red Saucony sneakers , appears more as absentminded professor of non sequitur studies than as genius star of the show; his "GK," introduced in his boxer shorts, still ironing his trousers only minutes before curtain call, would rather perform backstage than onstageperhaps because his stories at the microphone here are limited to screwball pitches for duct tape and Powdermilk Biscuits ("made from whole wheat raised by Norwegian bachelor farmers, so you know they're good for you"), with nary a word about Wobegon.
There are characters in the movie: the Johnson sisters from Oshkosh , Rhonda and Yolanda (Lily Tomlin , Meryl Streep ), county-fair-circuit singers whose loopy chats before showtime wander from the dangers of glazed doughnuts to the pleasures of rubber bands; the Old Trailhands, Dusty and Lefty (Woody Harrelson , John C. Reilly ), a pair of bad-joke-cracking cowboy crooners; and a hard-boiled but clumsy security guard called Guy Noir (Kevin Kline ), a familiar figure from Keillor's actual show. The flimsiness of these characters ends up adding to the movie's charm: These aren't really Midwestern radio performers so much as movie stars who've signed up for one more improv party with Altman. The director is chiefly interested in capturing the musical performances, which carry a casually infectious, low-key energy, even (or especially) when the stars are off-key.
Keillor's modest subservience to Altman's group dynamic feels downright gallant, and in the context of the veteran director's most humanistic movie by a wide margin, it certainly has its rewards. Spread across the dozen-odd players, the focus is soft; the movie's dressing rooms, stacked floor to ceiling with showbiz bric-a-brac, are lit as if by candle, the better for everyone in the cast to shine when it's their turn. The mood is exceedingly chatty but laid-back, which is new for the 81-year-old Altman. The director amends his copyrighted style ever so slightly: The dialogue here doesn't overlap so much as cascade; the zooms don't suggest a biologist squinting through a microscope, but someonean old man, I might as well say itleaning in for a tiny kiss.
The conceit allowing this warm elegy is that a corporate "axman" from Texas (Tommy Lee Jones ) is on his way to close down the theater and the show along with itwhich at any other time for Altman would've occasioned the director's defiant resistance or bitter vindication rather than what we have here, which is something closer to Oh, wellit was fun while it lasted. What's most Keillor-esque about the movie is its stoic Midwestern shrug in the face of imminent extinction. To give the artists the semblance of a chance to survive the corporate menace, Keillor's script conjures a patently absurd angel of death (Virginia Madsen  in a femme fatale's trench coat), who could ostensibly eliminate the threat with a wave of her hand. But Keillor and Altman know that there are forces much greater than fiction or even fate these days. The corporations have become bigger than Godwhich is a cynic's joke. The optimist's warmth inspired by Keillor's Wobegon resolve and Altman's twilight gentilityis that the artists will endure anyway.
