It wouldn’t be Thanksgiving without a turkey, and in “Old Dogs,’’ we have the season’s blue-ribbon gobbler. A pitiful family comedy about two aging buddies forced to play daddy, it looks exactly like what you’d get if Robin Williams and John Travolta went out, got hammered, scrawled scenes on a bar napkin in random order, gave the napkin to “Wild Hogs’’ director Walt Becker, and filmed it. Trust me, you could do this at home and save yourself the $9.50.
The stars play Dan (Williams) and Charlie (Travolta), childhood pals now running a successful sports marketing company. (Travolta’s hairpiece plays itself.) They’re cut from the odd-couple mold: Dan’s a repressed fussbudget, Charlie’s the good-time, uh, Charlie. The nonsensical plot begins when Dan’s ex-wife (Kelly Preston, a.k.a. Mrs. Travolta) from a one-day Vegas marriage turns up with 7-year-old twins he didn’t know were his (Conner Rayburn and Ella Bleu Travolta), announces she’s going to jail  - for two weeks! for eco-terrorism!  - and leaves the kids with the boys.
“Old Dogs’’ then veers from one flatly filmed, crassly comic sequence to the next with so little regard for connective logic that it’s practically avant-garde. The kids want to go camping? Cue the stars in Boy Scout uniforms harassed by Matt Dillon and Justin Long as psycho troop leaders. Dan’s not able to relax around his children? Charlie shows him how it’s done via a remote-controlled puppet suit. Who wrote this thing  - Wile E. Coyote?
If “Old Dogs’’ isn’t the absolute worst movie either star has appeared in, it’s close enough to count. No crotch goes unpummeled here, no supporting actor misused. The lovely Lori Loughlin is bizarrely cast as a translator who asks Charlie on a date to her bereavement group, which is led by Ann-Margret nattering on about a rhubarb pie. Rita Wilson turns up as a cross-eyed hand model. The stars end up stuck in a gorilla enclosure with a shrieking Seth Green and a guy in an ape suit. It’s the drugs, I tell you.
At least Travolta got to spend a working vacation with his wife and daughter; that still doesn’t mean we have to pay for it. “Old Dogs’’ has the feel of a project that was made in a spirit of collegial fun and finished in a rush of desperation, with digital effects Ella Bleu must have done on her Polly Pocket computer.
You get a sense of how long the movie has been sitting on the shelf when Bernie Mac, dead these 15 months, shows up as a magician. The studio, Disney, may have delayed the release of “Old Dogs’’ out of respect for the deceased comedian, or out of respect for Travolta after the death of his son earlier this year. That’s very sensitive. If they had any respect for audiences, they might never have released it at all.

Six-year-old boys may laugh at the bowwow of a comedy Old Dogs . But then, 6-year-old boys laugh at the word poop  and the word poop plays a big steaming part in this stinky endeavor. So does the sight of Japanese businessmen getting hit in the crotch with golf clubs. And the sound of Robin Williams' dignity flushing further down the pipes. Williams and John Travolta play old pals in their 50s, a cartoonish sad-sack divorcé and a cartoonish bachelor swinger, respectively, whose odd-couple routines are upended by the arrival of 7-year-old fraternal twins that Williams' character never knew he had. (Travolta's wife, Kelly Preston, plays the kids' mom, and Ella Bleu Travolta debuts as the girl twin.)
Exhausted as the premise already is  hapless boomer learns that real manhood is a function of committed fatherhood  Old Dogs  nevertheless finds ways to make the lesson even less tolerable. Directed by Walt Becker (who handled Travolta in Wild Hogs  with similar material), the movie includes an interminable scene of the men taking the wrong medications for their various boomer ailments, with weirdly horrible comedic side effects. In other awful interludes, they and their many ill-used guest stars are shot in disfiguring close-ups. The late comedy king Bernie Mac (who died in August 2008) is among those guests, a clue that this movie is an old dog indeed.


 To describe the knockabout family comedy “Old Dogs” as a ramshackle mess doesn’t begin to evoke the confusion and sloppy continuity of a movie whose disconnected parts sometimes appear to have been randomly assembled from a cutting-room scrap heap. “Chaos reigns,” the apocalyptic catchphrase from Lars von Trier’s “Antichrist,” might be more accurate. Even those professional charmers John Travolta and Robin Williams have their hands full trying to infuse some levity into their stick-figure characters.  Charlie (Mr. Travolta), a roguish bachelor, and Dan (Mr. Williams), a romantic softie, are lifetime best friends who run a successful sports-marketing operation in New York, although what they actually do is never shown. Through much of the movie they are pursuing an unspecified deal with a Japanese company, whose executives are portrayed as prudish, robotic ethnic clichés of Asian uptightness.  The movie, directed by Walt Becker (“Wild Hogs”) from a screenplay by David Diamond and David Weissman, imagines that seven years after Dan’s impulsive, one-day Florida marriage (followed by instant divorce), his alarmingly strident ex-wife, Vicki (Kelly Preston), arrives in New York dragging twins, Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta), whom Dan unknowingly sired during their brief relationship.  Vicki needs baby sitters for these charmless moppets. And when her best friend, Jenna (Rita Wilson), a hand model who agreed to take them, lands in the hospital after a grotesque manual mishap, Dan volunteers himself and a reluctant Charlie as temporary parents.  Once the children are in their care, “Old Dogs” succumbs to acute attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder as it devolves into a series of crude, ill-prepared slapstick bits and witless sight gags in which Charlie and Dan’s attempts to entertain the children are rebuffed with serial humiliations.  The abuses begin with a spray tan that turns Dan’s face into a conspicuous shade of chocolate. In an unfunny running joke, Charlie and Dan are continually mistaken as grandparents. A mix-up in the multiple medications taken by these soon-to-be old geezers plunges them into “Alice in Wonderland” territory, in which Charlie’s rubber lips freeze into a Joker-like grin during a bereavement ceremony, and Dan’s distorted depth perception makes him slam golf balls backward into the groins of his hosts.  Charlie hatches the bright idea to hire a children’s puppeteer (Bernie Mac, in his final screen appearance), who electronically wires the two temporary dads to become spasmodically dancing human puppets. The gag squanders a clever concept by giving them nothing really funny to do as they involuntarily twitch and wriggle.  They suffer the most brutal punishment during a game of extremely violent Frisbee while camping with the children at a Pioneer Scout Jamboree run by a grimly dedicated scoutmaster (Matt Dillon). In Dan’s ludicrous grand entrance at the twins’ birthday party in a zoo, he straps on a motorized superhero suit and awkwardly coasts into the affair from on high.  Even the movie’s inevitable turn toward sentimentality is just a tic rendered without conviction. Dan is attached to an ancient hound dog whose decrepitude is a metaphor for the movie’s contempt for its grumpy, middle-aged, would-be dads, with their medications and creaky joints. This imbecilic, mean-spirited farce, which sneers at adults, leaves you wondering: where are the Three Stooges when we really need them?    “Old Dogs” is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has some mildly rude humor.

John Travolta and Robin Williams make an amiable team as middle-age bachelors suddenly handed parental duties in "Old Dogs." Too bad this shrilly tuned comedy doesn't demand more than clock-punching effort from everyone involved. Nonetheless, as Travolta and helmer Walt Becker's prior Mouse House exercise, "Wild Hogs," proved, there's an underserved audience out there ready for unchallenging laughs with familiar faces and little or no Judd Apatow-style raunch. Prospects look solid.
Lifelong friends who co-own a Manhattan-based sports marketing firm, Charlie (Travolta) and Dan (Robin Williams) have passed the age of likely fatherhood, which is fine since neither feels any particular affinity for kids. Charlie is an unrepentant womanizer, while Dan is the veteran of two failed marriages -- the latter a drunken Miami rebound affair, quickly annulled.
But seven years later, that second ex-wife, Vicki (Kelly Preston), suddenly shows up with the news that Dan is in fact the father of her twins. Since Vicki is about to do two weeks' jailtime for trespassing in an environmental protest, she figures this as good a time as any for Dad to spend quality time with 7-year-olds Zach (Conner Rayburn) and Emily (Ella Bleu Travolta, John's daughter).
Then an unfortunate accident sidelines Vicki's best friend (Rita Wilson), necessitating that Dan step in as the fortnight's full-time babysitter. Charlie becomes this awkward new family's reluctant host when Dan gets bounced from his no-children-allowed condo.
Script by David Diamond and David Weissman is formulaic in outline yet almost arbitrary in detail, lurching from one half-baked slapstick setpiece to the next. These include a camping expedition with Matt Dillon as a humorless troupe leader (plus an unbilled Justin Long as a psycho fellow dad); a golf game with Japanese executives (Saburo Shimono, Kevin W. Yamada) in which balls repeatedly hit groins; a silly "human puppet" episode involving the late Bernie Mac (to whom the pic is dedicated, alongside Travolta's late son, Jett); and a zoo climax that gets Dan airborne, Charlie attacked by penguins and an office associate (Seth Green) adopted by a gorilla.
It's unclear whether the often frantic editing by Tom Lewis and Ryan Folsey prevents these scenes from building any rhythm or represents an attempt at salvage. In any case, there's a haphazardness to the goings-on here: Holes in logic and pacing are routinely plugged by incontinence jokes, pop-soundtrack cues and a whole lot of canine reaction shots from Charlie's actual old dog. Latter gets more screentime than any number of often bewilderingly underused name talents including Ann-Margret (one scene), Amy Sedaris (a couple of lines), and the unbilled Dax Shepard and Luis Guzman.
While supporting players are often pushed to hit very broad notes, the stars manage whenever possible to seem in relaxed form. Though neither is exactly moved to contribute memorable work here, their different comedic styles are complementary. They seem to be having fun -- and for all the film's routine and/or sloppy aspects, "Old Dogs" will likely convince audiences out for a disposable good time that they're having fun, too.
Look is the usual bright-and-bland palette of current studio comedies. John Debney's original score is most noticeable when underlining the expected occasional maudlin moments.
