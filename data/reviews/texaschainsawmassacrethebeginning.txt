         "Meat's meat and bone is bone," proclaims Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey) as he prepares a particularly gory repast. The makers of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning" take a similarly elemental approach to the revived franchise's latest installment. There's hardly a body part that isn't mangled or lopped off, ground up or sliced through. Although it's billed as a prequel to the 2003 remake, "Beginning" owes much to the brutal brilliance of Tobe Hooper's 1974 original (pointedly unmentioned in the new movie's press kit). This is not a slick, jokey horror movie in the post-"Scream" mold, but a genuine attempt to strip the coating from the audience's nerves. It's nasty and brutish, if not particularly short.
 
  Brothers Eric (Matt Bomer) and Dean (Taylor Handley) are steeling themselves for the horrors of the Vietnam war when inhumanity rears its head closer to home. As they're crossing the Lone Star state with their girlfriends Chrissie (Jordana Brewster) and Bailey (Diora Baird), their Jeep pulverizes a cow on the interstate. The man in a sheriff's uniform who pulls them from the wreckage already seems like an authoritarian nightmare straight out of "Easy Rider" or "Cool Hand Luke." Little do they know Hoyt has just made the real sheriff into stew for his cretinous brood.
 


         






    "The Beginning's" subtitle promises something along the lines of "Leatherface: Behind the Slaughter," but apart from reviving the original "Massacre's" pervasive sense of Nixon-era malaise, it doesn't offer much in the way of satisfying origins. We don't really need to know that "Leatherface" (Andrew Bryniarski) once toiled in a slaughterhouse; his fondness for meat hooks and finesse with a cleaver clearly indicated as much. Even the moment when he picks up his signature chainsaw passes with little sense of occasion. It's merely near to hand after he beats his former boss to a pulp with a sledgehammer.
 
  The original Massacre's" strength was its inversion of heartland bromides: The small-town sheriff was a grinning monster, the family dinner table piled high with cannibal gore. But there's no sense of betrayal in "The Beginning," which views the values whose erosion Hooper lamented as no more than kitsch. Surely, a group of four nubile teenagers whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere should know that the people who come to help them are homicidal maniacs. Haven't they seen a horror movie before?

The idea of a horror prequel is annoying. We know nobody from the family of maniacs in Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning  will die because we already saw them all alive in 2003's TCM: A New Hope . That means anyone looking for the returning Sheriff Hoyt to get punished for R. Lee Ermey's grody overacting here is screwed. So is this movie's youthful cast, who number only four so that they may be tortured slowly  it's the modern mode of horror  and artlessly. Unlike Hostel  or Wolf Creek , TCM:B  is rank and depressing.

 How many chainsaw massacres can one state possibly contain? One more, at least, from the look of “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning,” a prequel to a remake of a 1974 film that spawned numerous sequels and numberless copycats. There’s more to come, no doubt, given the bloodlust for torture and indifference to depravity characteristic of contemporary horror films. Every era gets the scare pictures it deserves, and there is nothing more unsettling in this orgy of hate than its overwhelming stench of corporate nihilism.  Written by Sheldon Turner and directed by Jonathan Liebesman, “The Beginning” mindlessly repeats the archetypal “Chainsaw” scenario. Four hotties (Taylor Handley, Matt Bomer, Jordana Brewster, Diora Baird) venture into backwoods Texas and are set upon by a clan of psychopathic cannibal hillbillies. The sick twist is that while the youngsters ostensibly function as an audience surrogate (who wouldn’t want to be that sexy and avoid being disemboweled?), the movie’s real sympathies lie with that clan, the Hewitts. The film delights in exploring their iconography. Where did Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski) get his flesh mask, and how did he come to select his signature power tool? What’s the back story of Officer Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey), and why does he eat people?  The answers are beside the point. The movie exists to brutalize. Like “The Passion of the Christ,” it is an invitation to hard-core sadism. Mel Gibson tried to turn atrocity into spiritual catharsis. The producers of “The Beginning” merely package it, sell it to the masses and hope they don’t vomit in their nachos.  “The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Extremely graphic sadism and stomach-turning nihilism.

Don't get too attached to any of the nubile young twentysomethings in horror prequel "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning." Expectedly grisly pic provides the origin story for Thomas Hewitt, aka "Leatherface" -- which means these kids are little more than chainsaw fodder for the Ed Gein-inspired cannibalistic killer. Whereas the three "Star Wars" prequels set up key events foreshadowing young Anakin's turn to the dark side, implication here is that Hewitt was always evil. In light of the 2003 Michael Bay-produced remake's $80 million box office take, expect this entry from "Rings" helmer Jonathan Liebesman to scare up healthy numbers.
From Jason's ubiquitous hockey mask to Mike Myers' William Shatner disguise, masks play a crucial role in American horror movies, and none is scarier than Leatherface's homemade version, ripped fresh from the faces of his victims and stitched together to cover his deformity. Though "The Beginning" offers few psychological insights into Leatherface's behavior, it does give bloodthirsty fans the chance to witness the mask's grisly creation.
Hewitt's sorry life dawns in a seedy slaughterhouse that, circa 1939, has seen none of the reform Upton Sinclair advocated in "The Jungle." Sitting at a fly-covered conveyor belt, a pregnant meat inspector keels over backward and convulses as her hideously deformed baby claws its way into the world, unassisted. Left for dead among the meat scraps, the child is rescued by a local dumpster digger and brought home to proud papa Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey).
Thirty years later, the slaughterhouse has failed a health inspection, but one hulking employee (with a makeshift mask) refuses to put down his meat cleaver. Unprovoked, young Thomas Hewitt (Andrew Bryniarski) bashes his boss' head in, then looks for a better weapon. Soon, he spies -- illuminated like Excalibur by a shaft of heavenly light -- the power tool that will make him famous.
The sheriff (Lew Temple) finds Hewitt, still carrying the chainsaw. Foolish enough to leave his shotgun on the dash and Hoyt in the passenger seat, the sheriff gets out of the car to confront the young man. Turns out, Hoyt has an even greater taste for blood than his adopted son, and he shoots the sheriff from behind. Later, serving the man's remains for dinner, he drawls, "We ain't never gonna go hungry again."
As scripted, these scenes might have played for camp or comic effect, but Liebesman hews close to the 2003 pic's bile-tinged snuff-film aesthetic. His approach falls somewhere between the overwrought sadism of the "Saw" series and the giddy gore-for-gore's-sake energy of "The Devil's Rejects," sharing those films' twisted notion that today's auds are willing to embrace such homicidal maniacs as heroes.
To jumpstart his killing career, all this backwoods Hannibal Lecter needs is victims, and "Beginning" dutifully supplies a fresh quartet of over-sexed youngsters to fit the bill -- two boys bound for Vietnam and their girlfriends along for the ride. Of the four, Jordana Brewster escapes much of the movie's brutality, outliving her less fortunate co-stars long enough to find a "Wolf Creek"-worthy surprise waiting in the backseat of her getaway vehicle.
Purists who wondered what had become of the family dinner scene (left out of the remake) should be pleased to find an even creepier version recreated here. Auds would be well advised not to attempt "Beginning" on a full stomach.
Technical aspects mimic the 2003 pic, which traded original's low-budget verite style for a more contemporary musicvideo look.
