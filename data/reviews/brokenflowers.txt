Anyone rushing to ''Broken Flowers" expecting trace elements of the old Bill Murray -- the loose-jawed reprobate of ''Stripes" and ''Groundhog Day" -- needs to be warned right now. The new Jim Jarmusch film is an altogether different animal: a minimalist miracle that transcends comedy and drama to wind up in a bigger and wiser place. It's very much the movie ''About Schmidt" should have been, and it's one of the best films of the year.
That said, if the contemplative drift of ''Lost in Translation" didn't do it for you, you might want to stay home this time. A Jarmusch movie in word, deed, and spirit, ''Broken Flowers" is exhilaratingly slow, which for many will simply mean slow.
 Enough air flows through the open spaces of this film to prompt either self-examination or the shredding of multiplex armrests. 
Those who can downshift appropriately, however, stand to be enraptured.
At this point in his career, Murray has pared his shtick to such levels of refinement that he can paralyze an audience merely by lifting an eyebrow. His character, an aging lothario named Don Johnston, doesn't have the energy to do much more than that, even when confronted with a enthusiastically naked teenage girl in a strange living room. Don was expecting her mother, who may or may not also be the mother of his son.
How did we get here? Don is wondering the same thing. When we first meet the onetime Don Juan (the film's sole misstep is to lean too hard on that metaphor), his party-boy days are well in the past. He has made a bundle in computer software somewhere along the line, but we're never given the specifics, and there's a chance the whole thing may have been a lucky fluke. His latest girlfriend, Sherry (Julie Delpy), has left him because he spends his days immobilized on the couch watching classic movies. Don has nothing left to prove and no interest in proving it. He wears a track suit but we never see him running. He has simply stopped.
He isn't even galvanized by the appearance of an unsigned letter (red typewriter ribbon on pink stationery) from one of his exes, claiming that his unknown son is now 20 and coming to look for dad. Don's neighbor, Winston, 
on the other hand, is tickled to death, and Jeffrey Wright (''Angels in America") walks off with his scenes as the nosy and bubbling family man with an active Sherlock Holmes complex. Winston borrows Don's black book, Googles the ex-flames in contention, arranges hotel and airfare, and just about shoves the hero out the door.
I could tell you what Don finds in his travels across America and his errant past, but I won't; so much of the pleasure in ''Broken Flowers" comes from being as surprised as he is when the doors pop open. The women are as varied as an ex-lover might hope and fear, and they're played with nuances of regret, relief, anger, contentment, and dismissiveness by a superb gallery of actresses (look at the cast list above if you must know). All right, I will say that Tilda Swinton, magnificent and almost unrecognizable, plays a black hole of fury who almost pulls the movie inside out on her own.
Most of the women have moved on, while Don has hardly moved at all. Like ''Lost in Translation," ''Broken Flowers" captures the rootlessness of modern travel -- the airport waiting areas and motel rooms that all look the same -- and suggests, very faintly, that if we don't make our own homes, in people's hearts and elsewhere, this is all we'll get. At the same time, Jarmusch loves these arid consumer landscapes (they're the backdrop to everything from 1983's ''Stranger Than Paradise" to last year's omnibus ''Coffee and Cigarettes") and finds a strange sort of Zen solace in their emptiness.
I don't drop that reference lightly. Jarmusch's ''Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai" (1999) cast Forest Whitaker as an enlightened warrior-gangster let loose in Tony Soprano-land, and ''Broken Flowers" increasingly takes on the packed profundity of a Zen aphorism. The ending, which is also too good to spoil, will probably frustrate literal-minded audiences, but it's the only one possible, and Jarmusch and Murray pitch it with true, mind-rocking grace.
If you're able to appreciate comedy delivered with the least amount of gestures, ''Broken Flowers" is also very, very funny. Murray atones for the overindulgent 
''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou" with a supremely watchful performance that earns laughs by letting us imagine
 what Don is thinking (that's how well we know Murray by now); seeing Wright bounce off the star like a Jack Russell terrier off the side of a Great Dane is a particular joy. Murray's comic timing is so adroit that he can deepen it into sorrow without strain, as in a suddenly moving late-inning encounter with a flower-shop employee (played by a young actress named Pell James, whose incandescence is the point).
There's a word in Tibetan Buddhism, ''bardo," that translates as ''a space between," an intermediate phase between one life and the next -- an island that's not one place or another. Jarmusch's hero has lived there most of his life. In ''Broken Flowers," he starts the process of rowing home, only to wonder if home even exists.

         The legend of Don Juan has been kicking around since 1630, when Spanish dramatist and monk Tirso de Molina wrote a play about a heartless libertine who seduces the daughter of a nobleman, then kills her father. The villain of the story, and an atheist to boot, Don Juan invites the statue of the dead man to dinner. Wouldn't you know, the statue turns up and escorts Don Juan to hell.
 
  Since then, Don Juan has popped up all over the place, modified to suit the artistic, philosophical and religious mood of the time. He's been, among other things, a lazy nobleman to Molière; a parody of a romantic hero to Byron; and a caped nutball to Johnny Depp.
 


         






    Now, to Jim Jarmusch, in his new film "Broken Flowers," he's Bill Murray: A dour, lonely and strangely listless suburbanite who spends his days sitting on his shrink-wrapped sofa, watching old Don Juan movies on TV.
 
  His name, naturally, is Don Johnston, and it makes young women giggle anachronistically, the thought of this glum old dude one letter away from sharing a name with the guy from "Miami Vice." Instead of descending into hell, Don embarks on a road trip through his romantic past, which pretty much turns out to be the same thing.
 
  Ever since Sofia Coppola cast him as the alienated movie star in "Lost in Translation," Murray has been exploring his regret-in-autumn side to touching, tragicomic effect. And at first glance he appears to be perfect for a story about a lifelong bachelor forced to confront his past. But Jarmusch's arch, detached style, which keeps an ironic distance at all times, seems more suited to stories about disaffected hipsters than to an actor like Murray, who is too old, too experienced and too smart to plod through a movie in a catatonic haze.
 
  When Don's latest girlfriend Sherry (Julie Delpy) walks out on him early in the movie, calling him "an over-the-hill Don Juan," the comparison seems intended ironically: If Don Juan has a contemporary incarnation, Don Johnston is not it. A retired computer mogul, he lives more like a retired mail carrier who just won the lotto. Forget seducing people; he hardly looks capable of calling anyone up.
 
  This may have been what Jarmusch was after — a contemporary reassessment of the self-centered American commit-phobe as doomed and soulless. Don is neither dashing, adventurous, philosophical nor naive. And for all the play of emotion that Murray's deadpan face allows, he remains frustratingly blank as a character, because none of the people around him care to draw him out. So what was he? Without a sense of the guy he was, or the life he led, or even the stories of what happened to his relationships — none of which are supplied — it's hard to fully empathize with Don's season of remorse.
 
  It's the big problem with "Broken Flowers," and one I don't think the movie — for all of its funny and occasionally poignant touches — ever really transcends. It's too cold and too uninterested in talk in general and the stories people tell themselves about their romantic lives in particular to do its premise justice. Murray was perfectly convincing as a playboy in "The Life Aquatic" and as a romantic in "Lost in Translation." But here, the camera stares at him grimly from across the room. He looks uncomfortable and reveals nothing. It's as if "Broken Flowers" were angling to be the repressed man's "Sherman's March." Instead of obsessive, neurotic introspection, we get Bill Murray in a Taurus, looking pained.
 
  Tonally, the movie is a return to early Jarmusch films like "Stranger Than Paradise," "Down by Law" and "Mystery Train," in which it takes an enthusiastic foreigner with a love of American culture to show the passive, disaffected native that there is something like meaning or transcendence in the vast emptiness that surrounds him. In "Stranger Than Paradise," the foreigner was Hungarian cousin Eva (Eszter Balint), come to inhabit the bluesy American world of Screamin' Jay Hawkins. In "Down by Law" it was Roberto (Roberto Benigni), who had read all of the great American writers ("in Italian translation, of course"), down to the famous "Bob" Frost. In "Broken Flowers," it's Winston (Jeffrey Wright), Don's Ethiopian neighbor, a self-styled Sam Spade with a large, boisterous family and an abiding love for detective fiction.
 
  On the morning of Sherry's departure, Don receives an anonymous letter in a pink envelope, informing him of the existence of a 19-year-old son he didn't know he had. Winston takes the faded postmark and lack of return address as a chance to apply his sleuthing skills, and after obtaining a list of the women Don dated 20 years earlier, he books the trip and sends Don out on a hunt for clues, reminding him always to bring flowers.
 
  The girlfriends appear in descending order of happiness-to-see-him. First is Laura (Sharon Stone), a blowsy NASCAR widow and professional closet-organizer with a sexually precocious daughter named Lolita (Alexis Dziena, playing another inaccurate literary reference). Don stays for dinner, then stays the night, all the while casting baleful glances in Laura's direction.
 
  Why becomes clearer as he visits ex-girlfriend No. 2, Dora (Frances Conroy), a former hippie now entombed in a prefab mansion with the terrifyingly toothy Christopher McDonald, playing her real estate developer husband, Ron. Again, Don stays for dinner, and gazes at Dora, who seems to live on the verge of tears, with a mixture of sadness and horror. You get the sense that he's coming to a weird conclusion — that this is what happens to women when Don leaves them. They commit suicide by husband. Don's next two exes, an icy "animal communicator" named Carmen (Jessica Lange) and a damaged motorcycle moll named Penny (Tilda Swinton), are not quite as welcoming. Carmen refuses an invitation to dinner, and Penny's howling and door slamming inspires her Hells Angel manqué of a boyfriend to punch Don's lights out for being insensitive. By the time Don reaches the grave of Michelle, ex-girlfriend No. 5, his look of blank horror turns to tears. Her tombstone credits her as a beloved daughter, sister. Talk about insult to injury: She's dead and single.
 
  Is all of this Don's fault? Is any of it? Are we meant to see them as the flowers that Don done broke, or is this just the unfortunate result of too many symbols lying around a spare narrative style? You wonder, because aside from Winston's earth-mama Jamaican wife Mona (Heather Alicia Simms), no good comes to any woman who survives prolonged exposure to him. In Don, Jarmusch has given us a peculiarly passionless serial lover. Which wouldn't have been a bad idea, if whatever passion he wasn't using had been divvied up among his women. Instead, they are all in their own way — with the exception of the exhibitionist Lolita and the young girl at the florist who provides Don with a Band-Aid — as withholding as he is. The comparison to the caped romancer wasn't really necessary. It doesn't take being a cad and a libertine to leave a trail of dead relationships in your wake anymore. Anyone can do it.

The bebop cadences of actor Bill Murray and filmmaker Jim Jarmusch are in such key-of-cool sync in the deadpan-tender who's-your-daddy drama Broken Flowers , it's a wonder that the two hipster silverheads haven't jammed together more often. In Flowers , Murray plays Don Johnston, he of the slippery, almost-celebrity name, a low-affect commitmentphobe with a host of fed-up ex-girlfriends on his romantic résumé. As played by Murray with seemingly effortless stillness, Don gives off a hum of masculine self-containment that's equally alluring and exasperating to women, and when first encountered, the determined bachelor has just been dumped by his latest had-it-up-to-here lover (Julie Delpy).
The only ''tell'' that Don isn't perfectly happy with his no-strings lot as a homeowner in AnyJarmuschTown, USA, is the obvious bang he gets out of visiting his neighbor Winston (Jeffrey Wright), a family guy with a passel of kids. So when he receives an unsigned letter from an old flame informing him that he is the father of a 19-year-old son who may now be searching for his dad, Don consults with Winston, an amateur gumshoe who'd never be confused with Columbo, and takes his friend's advice to travel the country calling on long-ago girlfriends who might fit the description of Anonymous Mom.
That's the setup. The joy is in the journey, as this most reluctant of possible papas makes an all-American road trip around the country, dropping in on ladies who, in their profound differences one gal to the next, reflect different aspects of Don and Bill Murray and the America of quirk and querulousness that Jarmusch has loved so eccentrically, and so independently, since Stranger Than Paradise . You can't get much more of a variety pack of mature sexuality than in Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange, and Tilda Swinton as Don's exes, yet much of the warm cool of Broken Flowers  comes from the director's underplayed ability to find equal off-kilter loveliness in the blatant siren call of, say, Stone (with the actress having a whooping good time caricaturing her own famous brassiness) and the librarian-tigress secrets of Six Feet Under 's Conroy.
And with each, Murray adjusts his bearing with the tiniest of calibrations, obviously made comfortable by Jarmusch's richly evident confidence in his own shaggy-dog storytelling. (The two had a previous salubrious working experience in the ''Delirium'' segment of Jarmusch's Coffee and Cigarettes  in 2003.) It's the rare former SNL  comedian who can get ardently appreciative applause simply for the way he looks balefully at a plate of carrots, but at this high point in his acting career, following Lost in Translation  and his work with Wes Anderson, Murray has boiled off all extraneous chaff in his representation of American men astonished to find themselves caring, about someone or something, when they least expect it.
It is perhaps not so surprising to find that Jarmusch cares too; most followers of the filmmaker's well-established brand can easily identify the vein of gentleness that runs through even his most downtown-cynical of comic scenarios, however disguised by irony. But what is surprising is how Broken Flowers  blossoms, as Don Johnston's past meets up with his present, into a movie of uncommon sweetness and delight.

 With "Broken Flowers," Jim Jarmusch's sly, touching new film, Bill Murray reaffirms his status as the quietest comic actor in movies today. His voice barely rises above a murmur, and his face remains almost perfectly still, its slightest tics and flickers captured by Mr. Jarmusch's discreet, mostly stationary camera.  The stillness is appropriate, since at the start of the movie Mr. Murray's character, Don Johnston, seems to have arrived at a point of stasis in his life. We first see Don on the couch in his large, tastefully decorated suburban home. His latest girlfriend, Sherry (Julie Delpy), is in the midst of leaving him, an event Don greets with a resignation that looks a lot like indifference. He is surrounded by nice stuff - a big television, sleek furniture, a Mercedes sedan - and has plenty of money, having been some kind of computer entrepreneur before retiring. A movie (or a movie critic) more inclined toward psychologizing might suggest that Don was depressed. In any case, as he tips over on his couch and falls asleep, we can surmise that he is inert, at rest, not going anywhere in particular.  But "Broken Flowers," like some of Mr. Jarmusch's other movies, is a road picture, which sends its poker-faced hero on a journey across a nondescript American landscape into his own past. As Sherry is saying goodbye, a letter arrives, typed in red ink on pink stationery, informing Don that 20 years earlier, he fathered a son. The anonymous message, apparently from one of Don's former lovers, warns him that the boy may be looking for him.  Don's impulse is to do nothing, but his neighbor, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), has other ideas. Winston is Don's friend and also, in almost every way, his opposite. In contrast to the slothful bachelor next door, he is a hard-working family man, with a wife, five children and three jobs. He is also something of an amateur detective, convinced that with the right clues and sleuthing methods, Don can find the mother of his supposed son and the missing pieces of his own history.  And so Don sets off, for brief reunions with four women he used to know, who are played by Sharon Stone, Frances Conroy, Jessica Lange and Tilda Swinton. What he finds are possible clues - basketball hoops suggesting the presence of a male child; a typewriter sitting on a patch of unkempt lawn; various pink objects, including a bauble-encrusted cellphone - and also further puzzles. His welcome, as he shows up in a rented car with a bouquet of flowers, varies. At one house he finds warmth and a roll in the hay for old times' sake, but elsewhere he meets with awkwardness, suspicion and even a punch in the face.  Does he find what he was looking for? I can't really say, and only partly because I don't want to spoil the movie. Winston's belief that the truth can be known - about other people, about oneself - is an idea the movie respects but does not really endorse. We go to the theater expecting to see experience tied up in a neat, attractive package, but the best movies, the ones that insert themselves into our own experiences and ways of looking at life, frustrate that expectation.  "Broken Flowers" is certainly beautiful, as lilting and seductive as the music, by the Ethiopian jazz artist Mulatu Astatke, that accompanies Don on his trip. Mr. Jarmusch's frames are full of odd, lovely details, and he has a rigorous visual wit reminiscent of classic cartoons and silent comedies.  He also has a teasing, literary sense of artifice. But he never goes for the obvious emotion or the easy disclosure, preferring elusiveness to exposition and tracking subtle shifts of mood rather than choreographing dramatic confrontations.  The emotions he uncovers are not always easy to name. Hovering around the edges of the frame - and playing across Mr. Murray's mouth and eyes - are longing, disappointment, bafflement and an earnest sense of wonder. As he goes off in search of the loose ends of his earlier romantic life, Don finds regret, but he also seems to be returning to the source of his fascination with women. Each of the actresses brings an indelible, eccentric individuality to the screen. We wish we could spend more time with them, or go back in time to see them with the younger Don.  The movie's title may imply the defeat of romance, but it is also a defense of romanticism - its own and Don's - as an approach to life that, while it may be flawed, is also generous. Don may be many things - a lost soul, a failure, a man adrift in his own life - but he is also, fundamentally, a lover, and "Broken Flowers" partakes of his chivalrous, gentlemanly spirit. Like a perfect, short-lived love affair, its pleasure is accompanied by a palpable sting of sorrow. It leaves you wanting more, which I mean entirely as a compliment.  "Broken Flowers" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual references and situations, nudity and profanity.

Bill Murray gives a lesson in minimalist acting in "Broken Flowers," a droll account of an aging bachelor's hesitant hunt for a son he may have fathered years before. Working in his typically idiosyncratic and episodic vein, Jim Jarmusch has nonetheless pitched the film slightly more toward mainstream tastes than usual for him, using excellent thesps in the service of accessible material. Based on the cast and a likely share of good reviews, Focus should be able to push this to agreeable B.O. with auds looking for moderately offbeat fare.
To be sure, Jarmusch goes his own way with the subject, avoiding the many opportunities it provides to milk emotion and sentiment out of a loaded premise. Rather, the writer-director extracts the humor to be found in the levels of ambivalence within Murray's gray Don Juan and his former paramours when they are reacquainted after so much time.
Left in the opening scene by his latest love, Sherry (Julie Delpy), Don Johnston (Murray) receives an unsigned letter on pink paper informing him that he has a nearly 19-year-old son who may be trying to track him down. Not visibly moved by the revelation, he shares the news with his next-door-neighbor, Winston (Jeffrey Wright), an Ethiopian native with five kids who fancies himself a sleuth and motivates his reluctant friend to figure out who among his old flames might have written the note.
Given four names (a fifth candidate has died), Winston tracks down addresses and books an itinerary for Don's exploratory road trip, giving him a homemade music CD and advising him to present pink flowers to each of the ladies. To all of this, Don exhibits no enthusiasm, but neither does he firmly resist, finally getting on a plane to an unspecified location to begin his visitations.
A seeming empty vessel emotionally, Don appears to exist in a virtual void. Not obliged to work after having made a bundle on computers (although he doesn't own one), Don is apparently content to be alone, listening to classical music or watching TV at home. He isn't seen reading, and other people tend to mildly irritate him, which Murray deftly expresses with a wide assortment of subtle facial grimaces and eye rolling.
In fact, he may not have much to offer, in the way of conversation, ideas or heart, but backgrounding, psychology or hints of vulnerability are resolutely ignored by Jarmusch, who is only interested in the here-and-now of his characters.
After a half-hour of preliminaries, first candidate turns up in the person of Laura (Sharon Stone), a trampy widow whose race car driver husband recently went up in flames on the track. Great fun is extracted from Don's meeting with her teenage daughter Lolita (Alexis Dziena), whose name says everything there is to know about her.
Looking man-starved, Laura invites Don to dinner and then to bed; it's obvious she would say something about it if she'd had a son by Don.
A seeming short drive away is Dora (Frances Conroy), who lives in the sort of lavish but soulless pre-fab house she and her husband Ron (Christopher McDonald) market as real estate agents. Tentative, prim and inwardly forlorn, Dora also invites Don for dinner, but when the guest gets around to asking if she has any kids, he hits a sore spot, after which there's nothing to talk about.
As the journey persists, there is no suggestion that the encounters are stirring any meaningful feelings in the impassive Don. The deadpan act is so consistent that one sometimes hopes the ice might be cracked by recollections of good times past of a few shared laughs or experiences. But he is nonetheless driven enough to continue his quest, however awkward it may be at times and however initially unchanged Don may be by the prospect of unknown fatherhood.
Most comically maximized interlude involves Don's visit with Carmen (Jessica Lange), whose profession as an "animal communicator" for a precious, upscale clientele with pet problems provides quite a few laughs and which gives Murray choice opportunities for comic skepticism.
But despite her questionable profession, Carmen also proves to be the most formidable and substantial of Don's former lovers, an educated and focused woman not terribly interested in looking back or opening her life for Don's inspection.
Last up is Penny (an all-but-unrecognizable Tilda Swinton in long dark hair), a biker chick living at a remote farmhouse who angrily tells Don to take a hike. Given the build-up to this final confrontation, episode is over much too fast and disappoints by giving Swinton so little to do.
But there is still a bit more to come, which ambiguously opens up other possibilities regarding the mystery in Don's life and his desire to solve it. Pic may end on a too inconclusive of a note for general audiences, but Jarmusch pulls back the emotional curtain just enough to suggest that Don's search may yet bear fruit.
Murray's tapped-down work is designed to hide inner feelings, if there are any, from sight, but also to fully present this man as he exists in relation to the world. If he truly wants to find what he's ostensibly looking for, he will have to come out of himself, something he finally seems to realize toward the end.
Limited to 10 minutes or so of screentime at most, the vet actresses must all register quickly, which they do with vitality; Stone has vampy fun in her role, while Lange, in particular, creates a well-rounded character of integrity and a strong sense of self-worth. Dziena squeezes all she can out of her juicy role as a teen tease, and Wright, in a less flamboyant role than he often plays, provides the crucial energy and dynamic in the early scenes with the unchatty Murray.
Shooting mostly in leafy East Coast suburbia and on countryside locations, Jarmusch and lenser Frederick Elmes have forged a clean, elegant look. Pacing is precise, and the journey is propelled by appealing jazz-leaning tracks from Winston's helpful CD.

Lanky maestros of minimalist deadpan, Jim Jarmusch  and Bill Murray  somehow never got together until 2003's Coffee and Cigarettes , wherein the actor drank straight from the pot in the erudite company of RZA and GZA . Stoic and decaffeinated, Murray's in every scene of the bittersweet Broken Flowers , a Jarmuschian bouquet of episodic structure, desultory road-tripping, and droll dislocation, each comic setup as simple and plywood-dry a contraption as ever.
Our hero is Don Johnston  (Murray), a name that's no doubt saddled him with 20 years of Miami Vice  jokes and perhaps a predisposition for womanizing. On her way out of his life, latest ex Sherry (Julie Delpy ) calls him "an over-the-hill Don Juan ," an assessment seconded by Don's energetic next-door neighbor, Winston (Jeffrey Wright ). Jarmusch spells out the protagonist's mythic resonances with uncharacteristic force, but as in Byron's epic poem, this Don Juan is a surprisingly passive conquistador. A premature retiree, rumpled and doleful in his tracksuit, Don barely reacts when he receives an anonymous letter informing him of the son he never knew he had, who's now grown and in search of his father.
With Don semi-catatonic on the couch, it's up to Winston, an aficionado of detective fiction, to track down four of the five maternal candidates (one has died) and map out his buddy's itinerary. Pink flowers in his hand and Mulatu Astatke  on his CD player, Don reunites with Laura (Sharon Stone ), recent widow of a race car driver who met a fiery end, but not before her vampy teen daughter Lolita (Alexis Dziena ) sheds her bathrobe and offers Don a popsicle. Paying a house call on next-try Dora (Frances Conroy ), Don stumbles into what looks like the same prefab manse where James Spader 's semi-reformed cad dropped anchor in Sex, Lies, and Videotape . Carmen (Jessica Lange ) is a self-possessed "animal communicator" with an impressive new-age office and a death-glaring receptionist (Chloö Sevigny ). By the time Don reaches the junkyard spread where final contestant Penny (Tilda Swinton , utterly squandered) resides and he falls afoul of some dentally challenged, mullet-coiffed motorcyclists, Broken Flowers has taken a decisive turn onto the Alexander Payne  Turnpike, a move first suggested by the snickering close-ups of Laura's NASCAR  memorabilia. The cutesy snark of the set design overlays Jarmusch's typically skeletal economy of exposition, nudging the director's laconic approach to characterization into faintly cartoonish one-dimensionality.
Once he's ogled the aptly named Lolita, watched raptly as a miniskirted Sevigny absentmindedly scratches her upper thigh, and gotten a Band-Aid and a chat from a lovely young woman at a florist's shop, it's clear Don's confronting not only the middle-aged incarnations of past conquests but the nubile ghosts of all the girls he's loved before. Indeed, he saves his warmest greeting for the lover who's dead and buried. Don's rainy graveyard interlude is as close to overt pathos as Broken Flowers  comes, but with elegant restraint the film subtly intimates the wintry dead endtwilight years bereft of love, partner, or vocationthat may be in store for its aged lover man. (Payne's About Schmidt  did too, when not gorging snidely on idiot Americana.)
After this and The Life Aquatic , Murray is a case study in the Kuleshov effect: Some may see a soulful master class in subliminal melancholy; others will watch him coast on the depressive-midlifer autopilot he programmed for Wes Anderson . At least the somber stillness of his visage is a matter of choice, which can't be said for a couple of the female performers here, who don the plastic surgeon's ghoulish mask of Botox , collagen, eye lifts, and cheekbone implants. As Bill Murraywhose doughy, timeworn features can be a film's subject and motorplays opposite beautiful actresses who've peeled, ironed, and sanded away the histories inscribed on their faces, Broken Flowers  inadvertently provides a handy case study of a Hollywood  double standard, one so pervasive it can even encroach upon a film by the most beloved and trusty of true-blue independents.
