Simultaneously smart and silly, Hot Fuzz
 demonstrates that it's not necessary to be a buffoon in order to lampoon. This send-up of buddy-cop movies is a thoroughly entertaining blend of wry British humor and climactic, over-the-top action-film heroics. It is a film that truly deserves the description "action comedy," a true hybrid that gives equal measure to both labels rather than merely using one form to prop up the other. Hot Fuzz
 comes from the same team behind 2004's hilarious spoof of zombie movies, Shaun of the Dead
: director and co-writer Wright, star and co-writer Pegg, and funnyman Frost. Pegg plays Sgt. Nicholas Angel, a London police officer who is banished by his superiors to the hinterlands because he is so good that he makes the rest of the department look bad. (His arrest record is 400% higher than any other officer's.) On his first night in the tiny village of Sandford, he arrests most of the local pub's clientele for being underage. Among them is Danny Butterman (Frost), son of the town's top cop (Broadbent), who winds up being partnered with Angel instead of going to the pokey. Danny, who is a devotee of buddy-cop movies (his two favorites being Point Break
 and Bad Boys II
), is thrilled to be paired with Nick � his ideal of a perfect cop. Most of their duties involve tasks such as chasing lost swans and the like, but eventually a real plot involving a crooked store manager (former James Bond Dalton) starts to emerge, at which point the movie goes into action overdrive. Mimicking and tweaking moments from films by the likes of Tony Scott, Michael Bay, and Jerry Bruckheimer, Hot Fuzz
 shows a great love and knowledge of everything it satirizes. Actors such as Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan show up for delightful cameo turns, while Pegg and Frost give the impression of having bounced off each other all their lives. At two hours, Hot Fuzz
 drags a bit in its midsection but is nevertheless the most originally funny movie to hit U.S. screens in a while. (See p.55 of this week's Screens section for an interview with Wright, Pegg, and Frost.)



Hands up, those of you who saw 2004�s zombie farce ��Shaun of the Dead.�� You know the drill: A comic British take on a lowbrow Hollywood genre � not quite Python-surreal, but smart and fast and playing by the rules while insisting on a sort of comfortable English shabbiness. Very funny, very cheeky, just gory enough.
Now apply that template and much of the key personnel to two-cop action flicks, add some warm Guinness, and � voila � ��Hot Fuzz.�� It�s to the ��Lethal Weapon�� movies what left-hand driving on a country lane is to a freeway chase: pokey, more than a little daft, but with a bloody surprise around every hedge.
Sergeant Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg, who co-wrote the script with director Edgar Wright, both ��Shaun of the Dead�� vets) is the best bobby in London � so annoyingly rule-conscious that his superiors pack him off to the countryside so he won�t make them look bad. Re-assigned to the sleepy town of Sandford, Angel spends his first evening ID-ing the lads down the pub and putting one particularly drunken lout in the tank. Bad news: the lout is Police Constable Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), son of Chief Inspector Butterman (Jim Broadbent) and Nick�s new partner.
Nick�s a by-the-book martinet, Danny�s a wide-eyed blob, and the duo spend more time chasing down the vicar�s swan than pursuing suspects � all familiar comic territory, and thanks to whoever put the Kinks� ��Village Green�� on the soundtrack. ��Hot Fuzz�� keeps things percolating, though, by introducing us to the townspeople, played by a roster of slumming British talent.
There�s Broadbent, of course, and a one-time James Bond, Timothy Dalton, as a smarmy local retailer. Billie Whitelaw (Sam Beckett�s muse, if you�re keeping score) pops up as the publican�s wife. Look fast for Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan, Cate Blanchett, and ��Lord of the Rings�� director Peter Jackson as a homicidal Santa Claus. All keep admirably straight faces even when they�re losing their heads.
For it wouldn�t be a cozy English hamlet without a mad killer on the loose. Despite the big guns and stray bits of ultra-violence, ��Hot Fuzz�� has its heart in the garden-party whodunnits of yore (see 1946�s ��Green for Danger,�� just out on DVD, with its murders in a country hospital). At the same time, Danny knows Nick will never be a true crime-fighter without a few late-night screenings of ��Bad Boys 2.�� It�s a matter of balance, innit?
��Hot Fuzz�� is so disarming you forgive its lapses, like the handful of spurting-blood scenes that feel tonally wrong and on loan from ��Shaun of the Dead.�� The movie overstays its welcome, too, but just as the fun�s turning tedious, Pegg, Frost, and Wright say sod it all and deliver a grandstanding action climax, complete with exploding cars, slow-motion shotgun recoils, and pistol-packing parsons. It�s ��Dirty Harry�� in the Home Counties � macho action with a spot of tea � and it is blissfully silly.


         The British comedy triumvirate of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, who made the zombification of the romantic slacker comedy so much fun in "Shaun of the Dead," returns with a full frontal assault on action movies with "Hot Fuzz." Bringing in what appears to be the entire roll call of top-flight British character actors as accomplices, the movie takes aim at crime-stoppers in general with particular attention paid to the buddy cop subgenre.
 
 Scene after scene will have you wondering, "Isn't that ... ?" and in most cases it is, as Steve Coogan, Bill Nighy, Jim Broadbent, Billie Whitelaw, Paddy Considine, a delightfully oily Timothy Dalton and a host of others parade past. Apropos of its subject matter, the film joyfully wallows in Bruckheimerian excess — over-the-top car chases, huge explosions and slow-motion gunplay. Even its primary downside, a two-hour-plus running time, would seem to be a byproduct of the indulgence.
 


         






   The poker-faced Pegg stars as Nicholas Angel, a London bobby whose arrest record is 400% above anyone else's, prompting his superiors to promote him to sergeant and dispatch him to the sleepy village of Sandford in the West Country because he's making everyone else on the force look bad. The tightly wound, by-the-book Nicholas makes an unwelcome impression on his first night in town by clearing the local pub of underage drinkers and arresting what appears to be the town drunk (Frost, doing a damn fine impression of his zombie walk from "Shaun").
 
 In the bitter light of morning, the drunk turns out to be Constable Danny Butterman, the son of the local chief inspector (Broadbent) as well as Nicholas' new partner. Everything Danny knows about police work comes from the movies in his massive DVD collection, but Nicholas attempts to teach him the proper approach with appreciably slapstick results.
 
 The quiet exterior of Sandford disguises something more ominous, and when it's unleashed, the town's police force is ill-prepared. Good thing they have Sgt.  Angel at the ready.
 
  The film begins with a frenetic preamble establishing the curriculum vitae of Angel and the story's premise.
 
  Director Wright and editor Chris Dickens use a rat-a-tat-tat pace that sends up police procedurals and the overly stylized visuals of TV shows such as "CSI" while gently tweaking the veddy British tradition of the dignified mystery.
 
 The script, written by Wright and Pegg, definitely feels more English in its first half before kicking into adrenaline overdrive in the second, mimicking U.S. action movies of the last 25 years.  Wright also shows he's lost none of his affection for gore, dispatching the less fortunate with bloody zeal. A couple who lose their heads in a supposed traffic collision are described by one of Sandford's finest as having been "decaffeinated."
 
 The rapport between Pegg and Frost is much as it was in "Shaun," with Nicholas playing straight man to Danny's goofy oafishness. The pair become unlikely friends as Danny shows Nicholas the finer points of "Point Break" and "Bad Boys 2" while the film riffs on the implied homoeroticism of such films.
 
 Pegg isn't a big guy but embraces the action hero mantle with great gusto, experiencing a Clint Eastwood-like enhancement of his voice when the chips are down.
 
  Frost is a burly Saint Bernard of a man whose infectious enthusiasm will leave you torn between wanting to rub his ears or dive for cover from the flying slobber.
 
 One thing that distinguishes the movie from its American counterparts such as the "Scary Movie" series or its related spawn is an insistence on telling a story. Whereas the U.S. movie parodies are content to string together gags, often without so much as a segue, Wright and Pegg are storytellers who weave their naughty bits into genuine characters and a plot. It's a ridiculous plot, but one that's absolutely in the spirit of the films they're satirizing.
 
  There is also a sense that they have genuine affection for these movies and are not so much ridiculing them as paying homage.
 
 
 "Hot Fuzz." MPAA rating: R for violent content including some graphic images, and language. Running time: 2 hours, 1 minute. In general release.   

In the very funny cop comedy Hot Fuzz , overachieving London police officer Nicholas Angel (Simon Pegg) commits a very British sin: He's too good. (His arrest record is, oh, 400 percent higher than that of the rest of his mates.) He stands out, and that won't do. Such showy personal initiative is not sporting; frankly, it's too...American. So punishment is in order, of a very British kind. Angel is sent to patrol England's prettiest, sleepiest travel-brochure country village, the kind of violet-scented hamlet that sends American tourists into swoons of cottage envy, and over the decades has sent British mystery writers into creative reveries about crimes likely to be committed behind lace curtains. The friendly dot on the map known as Sandford is a place where everyone knows everyone, greets everyone, and keeps an eye on everyone. And from the minute Angel arrives, zealously bearing down on underage beer drinkers at the local pub and locking up one scofflaw for driving while intoxicated, all citizens' eyes are on the new guy.
That drunk driver? Turns out he's a copper himself, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost), the amiably blobby son of the village police chief (Jim Broadbent). Danny's also a geeked-out fan of full-throttle, lethal-weapon-wielding American cop movies, a brute-force romantic who stares into his pint glass dreaming of the opportunity to shoot at bad guys while jumping through the air sideways with a buddy watching his back. Wham! Bam! Bruckheimer, toast, and jam! In Butterman's world, all art aspires to the condition of Point Break  and Bad Boys II .
Before Hot Fuzz  careens to its cheery, bullet-riddled conclusion, the dreamer will get his chance to mow down punks and suckers for real, since Sandford turns out to be a festering hellhole of murder, venality, and dark arts practiced even by sweet little old ladies and clergymen. And the buddy-cop duo of Nicholas Angel and Danny Butterman will be called upon to team up, unleashing enough firepower (both satiric and metallic) to make John McClane cry ''Overkill!'' (There'll be time, though, for those sweet moments of male bonding that make Martin Lawrence and Will Smith or Danny Glover and Mel Gibson such a cute couple.) Before the picture is over, too, some of the most famous players in British film and stage will have pitched in, as committed to this national product as if they were Oscar candidates for Murder on the Orient Express . Thespians on the lam include Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan, Martin Freeman from BBC's The Office , Edward Woodward from The Equalizer , Paul Freeman from Raiders of the Lost Ark , Billie Whitelaw from The Omen , and Timothy Dalton, in full 007 grandeur as a smarmy supermarket magnate. This movie set, clearly, was a VIP room for the cool kids.
Its siren-loud jokes going wah-wah-wah  in a production high on cinema love, Hot Fuzz  arrives in the wake of wild box office success in the U.K. The movie comes courtesy of the same creative team who identified the similarities between bona fide zombies and British pub crawlers so delightfully in 2004's Shaun of the Dead . Director Edgar Wright co-wrote the script with Pegg, and Pegg is once again on screen with his best friend, Frost, playing his best onscreen friend. These guys are as much A-level scholars of movie genre conventions as their better-known, better-hyped Stateside colleagues Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez  but then again, so were brothers David and Jerry Zucker and Jim Abrahams in their Police Squad  oeuvre. What sets Wright and Pegg apart, I think, are their sharp instincts for the hilarity  of cultural differences. They just love mucking around in the pond of temperamental differences that separates the U.K. and the States.
But in this, Hot Fuzz  suffers in export to our side of the Atlantic  and, indeed, to any audience outside the filmmakers' home base, in a way Shaun of the Dead  did not. Few outsiders previously knew just how close zombiedom is to English pub culture, but thanks to Bruckheimer et al, the whole world knows the ways of American cop buddies who shoot first and crack wise later. Seeing a couple of Brits imitate Bad Boys swagger, however smartly, is not surprising enough to us  to merit distinction, either as an action pic or as a parody of an action pic. Oooh, look, we nod, those clever British people are imitating our noisy crap! Spot on, punks.

 The wits behind the controlled chaos that is “Hot Fuzz,” a parody of Hollywood-style action flicks, wield a somewhat heavier comic cudgel than they did in their last big-screen outing, the zombie caper “Shaun of the Dead.” This time, as they say in the blow-up business, it’s personal, or at least somewhat personalized, since the more obvious targets here include high-octane producer-auteurs like Jerry Bruckheimer and Joel Silver, who, with their fat budgets and armies of heavily armed bad boys, have helped define the modern action spectacular, reshaping the old kiss-kiss, bang-bang movie experience into the cinema of lock-and-load.  Simon Pegg, the snub-nosed, cricket-bat-swinging blond avenger of “Shaun of the Dead,” plays Nicholas Angel, a crack London police officer who’s bounced to a small town by his inferior superiors (Bill Nighy, Steve Coogan,  Martin Freeman, smirking and smiling) for being just too damn good at his job. Banished to the sticks, where a missing snow-colored swan initially proves the only investigative distraction, he finds himself desperate for action. He rousts some teenagers from the local pub, but outside of fielding smutty insults from the precinct’s layabout detectives (Paddy Considine and Rafe Spall, as matching and mustachioed as a Tom of Finland cartoon), there’s little to do but water his lily plant and nurse his cranberry juice nightcap.  There are few girls allowed inside the Bruckheimer and Silver clubhouses, and so it is here. Although the homosocial worlds of Messrs. Bruckheimer and Silver on occasion make room for a Venus in leather like Carrie-Anne Moss or, more routinely, a neonatal-size waif like Keira Knightley, these are testosterone-fueled domains, largely defined by bulging muscles and exploding guns, both symbolic and actual. It’s a world that Mr. Pegg and the film’s director, Edgar Wright, who together wrote the awfully funny screenplay, know intimately and recreate with admirable fealty, from the hard-crashing edits to the soft, tender looks exchanged by Angel and his slavishly attentive sidekick, Danny Butterman (Nick Frost). It’s a world in which boys will be boys at every available opportunity.  For the most part these are fine boys indeed, and in the wonderful, weird case of Timothy Dalton, an unctuous toff with a menacing twinkle in his eye, even better than that. (Look for the director Peter Jackson in an eye-blink cameo.) Mr. Pegg and Mr. Frost, who played best buddies in “Shaun of the Dead,” have an easy, believable rapport that, once it gets cooking, opens up a pocket of sweetness in a film that is otherwise played cool and for laughs. Mr. Pegg’s performance here, befitting his uptight, upright character, is somewhat one-note, if otherwise likable, with little of the Everyman depths that were finally tapped in “Shaun.” The emotional intimacy of Mr. Pegg and Mr. Frost’s onscreen relationship suggests that there’s more to these performers than parody.  A wee bit of plot tucked amid a fusillade of film-geek jokes and charming nonsense, bang-bang, hee-hee, “Hot Fuzz” trots out the predictable verbal and visual allusions to modern Hollywood action movies great and forgettable, hitting the highs (“Point Break”) right along with the lows (“Bad Boys II”). The meta-movie silliness works well enough for the crisp setup. But since Mr. Wright and Mr. Pegg are essentially parodying self-parodies (see “Con Air” ad infinitum), they have also smartly kinked up their conceit by setting most of the film in a sleepy village that might as well be called Ye Old English Towne, thereby wedding one of the most irritating British exports (see “Calendar Girls” ad nauseam) to one of the most absurd American ones.  Think of it as “The Full Monty” blown to smithereens.  “Hot Fuzz” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Big bangs, hard oaths.

A by-the-book top cop and his bozo sidekick uncover murder and mayhem in a picturesque English village in "Hot Fuzz," a straight-faced British spoof of everything from Yank crimers and slasher pics to Agatha Christie whodunits and homoerotic U.S. buddy movies. Third theatrical feature by young English helmer Edgar Wright, teaming again with "Shaun of the Dead" actors Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, comes up with a sustained genre parody that's equally funny but (maybe in deference to the genre) much more pumped up.
Pic opened huge in Blighty, taking $11.5 million in its first five days, with no signs of running out of gas. Limited U.S. release is set for Apr. 20 via Rogue Pictures.
Aside from Pegg (again co-scripting) and Frost, his colleagues on the cult TV comedy series "Spaced" (1999-2001), Wright has assembled a roll call of well-known character actors, including Bill Nighy and Steve Coogan in cameos, an almost unrecognizable Billie Whitelaw as a hotelier and vets Edward Woodward, Timothy Dalton and Jim Broadbent as village folk. Recognition factor is part of the joke -- as is the multitude of comic references in the dialogue (some strictly British, others more international) -- but the pic's fast pacing and general targets should ensure a warm welcome beyond U.K. shores.
In a zappy intro, we meet dedicated cop Nicholas Angel (Pegg), whose idea of an evening's entertainment is watering his Japanese peace lily. Humorless Angel is so good at everything he does (with an arrest rate 400% higher than that of any other cop) that his superiors (Martin Freeman, Coogan, Nighy) elevate him to sergeant but also exile him to the West Country village of Sandford to stop him from showing them up.
The local cop shop is run by chummy Inspector Frank Butterman (Broadbent), and the two detectives (Paddy Considine, Rafe Spall) are leering idiots who wouldn't know a crime if it bit them on the ass. Angel gets everyone's backs up his first night by arresting all the under-18s in the local pub and hauling in for drunk driving a slob called Danny (Frost), who turns out to be Butterman's son and Andy's future partner.
The sly comedy, paragraphed at regular intervals by machine-gun editing inserts, moseys along in a style similar to "Shaun of the Dead" for the first hour, though without the laid-back, couch-potato tone that reflected that movie's characters. Pegg is very good at this kind of double-take humor sans the double take, and his chemistry with Frost (which later morphs into a parody of buddy movies) seems effortless.
A plot of sorts hoves into view at the halfway mark as a figure in Grim Reaper garb begins killing the villagers, starting with an obnoxious lawyer and then fanning out to include a businessman, a florist and a local journo. Decorated with gallons of spurting blood, the murders -- the last of which is hilariously spectacular -- prep the ground for the third act, in which Sandford becomes the unlikely stage for bullet ballets and screeching car chases as Angel and Danny lay bare the truth.
Some may miss the bumbling humor and 100% English tone of "Shaun," which was painfully exact in hitting its targets. "Fuzz" is much slicker and more international in feel, and in its final reels, it doesn't know when to quit. Pic could easily lose 15 minutes from its two-hour running time.
Still, there are few dull patches, largely thanks to a cast that seems to be having a ball and, more importantly, communicates that via Wright's script and direction. Broadbent and Dalton are especially good as Angel's hail-fellow-well-met superior and oily No. 1 suspect.
Production values are fine, with flavorsome use of the village of Wells, Somerset, standing in for the fictional Sandford; Jess Hall's widescreen lensing and Chris Dickens' smart editing proving smooth partners. Color temperatures on print caught were not ideal, ranging from warm and reddish to cold and steely. David Arnold's brash score hits the Stateside genre mark.

For all the huzzahs deservedly heaped upon 2004's Shaun of the Dead , in which it took a good long while to discern the living from the walking deceased, the zombie-flick spoof was little more than an extended sketch taken, oh, 19 minutes beyond its breaking point. But the movie, created by director Edgar Wright  and star Simon Pegg , provided such a bloody good time that its acolytes and admirersthose weaned on George Romero  gorefests and the Pegg- and Wright-penned slacker Britcom Spaced , chieflydidn't mind that it dragged its undead feet a little too long. Fact is, those who watched Dead on DVD found myriad deleted sequences and outtakes, among them a prolonged gag involving Coldplay , as worthy of savoring as the feature itself. So, yeah, Shaun of the Dead was too long. And not nearly long enough.
The same can be said of Hot Fuzz , wherein Wright and Pegg refashion the American buddy-cop genre in their own deadpan image. At a running time of more than two hours, it's a wee bit lengthy; the thing's damned near epic. And yet to see it once is to fall in love and want to pay up immediately for another screening, so abundant are the poker-faced gags that race through the quaint village of Sandford in which the would-be-wannabe Bay-'n'- Bruckheimerian blockbuster is set. Hot Fuzz is a cult film writ humongousa send-up of Hollywood  spectacles that's far bigger and better than anything to which it pays homage.
Yes, Wright and Pegg have built their film on the foundations of othersnearly 200, by their estimation, ranging from The Wicker Man (the low-key original, not its garish redo) to the oeuvre of Chuck Norris , to Wright fave Freebie and the Bean ,  to, finally, Lethal Weapon , Bad Boys II , and Point Break , the trinity that inspires Fuzz 's overwrought gunplay and homophobic homoeroticism, which, come to think of it, are the exact same things. The tributes extend even to the casting of Hot Fuzz , in which Edward Woodward  (of both The Wicker Man and The Equalizer ) stars as the surly head of the Sandford Neighborhood Watch Association , former James Bond  Timothy Dalton  appears as a slick supermarket manager, and Paul Freeman  ( The Long Good Friday , Raiders of the Lost Ark ) shows up as a reverend with ungodly secrets hidden beneath his frock. There is even a Moulin Rouge  dig, shortly after Jim Broadbent  turns up as the kindly police chief who knows plenty about Sandford's skeletons.
Pegg, looking years older than 37, plays Nicholas Angel , who, we are told during a rapid-fire intro narrated by Martin Freeman , is the best cop on the London police force, trained in everything from hand- to-hand combat to chess. He's so good, in fact, that his supervisorsplayed, in bit roles, by Freeman, Bill Nighy , and Steve Coogan transfer him to the idyllic Sandford (Wright's actual hometown of Wells), lest Nicholas keep shaming his inept colleagues. Sandford, where tavern owners serve pints to underage younglings to keep them from roaming the streets, has but one major concern: how to once more win the Village of the Year contest.
But things, of course, aren't what they seem in Sandford, and the movie crawls toward a combustible finale that references every cop movie Wright's ever seen; indeed, it often feels like the movie exists solely to reference a pivotal scene from Point Break , in which Keanu Reeves  fires his gun into the air in a fit of impotent rage. That scene in particular is a favorite of Danny Butterman  (Nick Frost ), the town drunk and police officer with whom Nicholas is partnered. Danny's been waiting his whole life for someone like Nicholasa proper cop who's been stabbed and shot at a few times and who seemingly lives the life of his cinematic idols.
Ultimately, Hot Fuzz is a kind of a love story between these two guysappropriate, as the film is obviously inspired by the scene from Lethal Weapon in which Mel Gibson  begs Danny Glover  to put his gun in Gibson's mouth. But Hot Fuzz  transcends its influences to create a brilliant Brand New Thinga laconic laff-riot. It's not tethered to its roots, nor constrained by its tributes to lesser things. (That was always the problem with Airplane! , which doesn't hold up as well as you think it does.) It thrives as its own entity, a British variation on Hollywood nonsense, and as such it's a little gloomier, a little coarser, and a lot more cerebraloh, and funnier than all the Reno  911!  boxed sets combined.
