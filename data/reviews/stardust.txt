"Fairies wear boots," recalled a sage and seasoned wise man whose name eludes me at the moment, "I tell you no lies." That's as good a description as any for this uneven adaptation of Neil Gaiman's bestselling, back-to-basics "fairy tale," which in the reading felt more like an extended, prose-heavy issue of the author's first and greatest success: the comics series Sandman
 (a landmark of the art form that breezed through history both real and imagined and wove a truly magical tapestry out of Gaiman's seemingly unslakable thirst for the myriad mythologies that, then as now, act as civilization's crystalline framework. Vaughn's movie feels, on the other hand, clogged with perhaps too much fairy dust; it's like double-dosing Tori Amos and Arthur Machen while setting The Princess Bride
 on stutter. Too much fantasy is never enough, however, for Vaughn and his actors, who appear to be having way too much fun with their roles to worry about the niceties of narrative overcrowding. Vaughn previously helmed the excellent London-set neo-noir Layer Cake
, which seems a veritable font of cinematic restraint in comparison to Stardust
. The plot eliminates much of Gaiman's original novel while keeping the resonant core and adding a flouncing De Niro to the mix. Cox plays Tristran, a nervy young man who sets out from his rural England town of Wall to retrieve a fallen star for his (he assumes) true love, Victoria (Miller). His quest takes him into the fairy-tale land of Stormhold, where he discovers that the celestial fragment he seeks is actually Danes, which makes his promise to Victoria all the more interesting and his return all the more fraught. Specifically, fraught with Pfeiffer as Lamia, the grand dame of a triplet of witchy sisters, as well as seedy prince Septimus (Strong) and his pals Lords Primus and Secundus (Flemyng, Everett). Everyone except Tristran is searching for the fallen star for nefarious ends, and Cox, who barely registers as the heroic archetype in the film's opening is by the end trading thrusts and parries with Pfeiffer and Strong like a lankier Errol Flynn minus the charm. Danes does space debris proud, though, and her performance, along with Pfeiffer's insidiously wicked turn as Lamia and the aforementioned left turn into Bizarro World by De Niro, keeps the whole shebang afloat. Still, Stardust
 has lost a good amount of its magic in the transformation from page to screen. It's the cinematic equivalent of getting a punch in the mind's eye by a bunch of fairies wearing the coolest Doc Martens this side of Florin.


Any movie that has Claire Danes playing a fallen star sounds too painful for words. The irony! "Terminator 3," "Stage Beauty," "The Family Stone," "Evening": Neither her luminousness nor her intelligence has been put to particularly thrilling use. They haven't, really, since she blazed through Baz Luhrmann's "Romeo + Juliet." For her sake, I'm embarrassed to remember how long ago that was. At this point even she seems over herself. The expression she wears in "Stardust," a romantic science-fiction fantasy with her as the aforementioned fallen star, breaks your heart. It seems stuck between a grimace and a cringe: It's the face of a maiden caught taking out the garbage.
This movie also happens to have parts for Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert De Niro, Peter O'Toole, Sienna Miller, Ricky Gervais, and others. So "Stardust" is not just a nadir for Danes. It stinks for almost everybody. But Danes is the one person who seems to show it. The setting is a crypto-medieval English village called Wall, so named for the pile of cobblestones that separates the villagers from Stormhold, the parallel universe just beyond it.
One love-struck villager named Tristan (Charlie Cox) promises to deliver a fallen star to the too-beautiful lass (Miller) for whom he pines, requiring him to sneak across the wall. He finds his crashed star, named Yvaine, but has to protect her from both the family of feuding princes who need her powers to ascend to the throne and the wizened witch (Pfeiffer) who wants the star's heart to keep her looking young forever.
"Stardust" certainly could have gone somewhere fun. But the magic and zip you need to get a blimp like this off the ground is scarce. Nothing Matthew Vaughn does with the material -- he and Jane Goldman adapted it from Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess's novel -- generates much enchantment. Vaughn produced Guy Ritchie's gangster pictures, and, before this film, made his own knockoff called "Layer Cake." The crackle of those movies never breaks into this new one. "Stardust" looks drearily secondhand. The powers that shoot from Pfeiffer's fingertips recall the ectoplasm from "Ghostbusters." So do a lot of the effects. When the camera can spin or swoop or whoosh, it does, which is to say it's doing this for half the movie. The music is the sort of crashing stuff meant to signal action, but for a lot of the movie it is
 the action. Are we supposed to be under a spell or under attack?
The filmmakers go for the kinkiness and naughtiness in the book but don't know how naughty to be. It's as if the ribaldry has been focus-tested out. When Pfeiffer's witch pretends to be an innkeeper to close in on Danes's star, she offers a massage, which should be the year's erotic high point. But that sequence is confused with jokey business. The movie isn't remotely as sardonic or irreverent as it so clearly wants to be. Pfeiffer, playing her second shrew of the season, looks like she's enjoying herself in a part that shows off her severe beauty and her comedic prowess, but the role is a dud that seems borrowed from that Bette Midler Halloween turkey "Hocus Pocus."
As the king, O'Toole exits early, which is lucky since his costume appeared to be devouring him anyway. Rupert Everett plays one of his sons, defenestrated in the opening minutes. His punishment for an early escape is having to spend the rest of the movie sitting around as a member of the growing chorus of ghoulish dead princes, in bleached-out special effects no less. (Wouldn't that have been the occasion for ectoplasm?)
The movie goes right exactly once: When De Niro shows up as a closet-case pirate for a series of daylight sequences aboard his floating ship. If ever there was an occasion for him to fax in a note saying the dog ate my performance, this would be it. But surrounded by the exuberant bunch of actors playing his crew, De Niro makes a macho-hammy-swishy mess of himself. ("Tr√©s you
!" he tells Cox). He's terrible, but he's having, well, a gay old time. It's contagious. When Danes is around him the pain in her smile is all gone.


         FLOATING in on an airy breeze of dreams and true love, the lively adventure-romance "Stardust" offers that elusive quality summer movies are supposed to possess but rarely do -- total escape.
 
 The fantastical story of an ordinary shop boy's quest to prove his love takes us on a journey into a magical kingdom of conspiring witches, murderous princes, flying pirates and a fallen star. Sophisticated in its execution, it is a movie that possesses a child's whimsical sense of wonder that propels the action, coupled with an adult sensibility that gives it emotional heft.
 


         






   In craftily melding these disparate elements, director Matthew Vaughn delivers a worthy follow-up to his stylish feature debut, "Layer Cake," ably moving from that film's neo-gangster environs to the bigger-budgeted fairy tale world of "Stardust." The screenplay by Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman is an adaptation of the graphic novel by Neil Gaiman and follows in the spirit of "The Princess Bride," gently spoofing the rules of enchantment while simultaneously embracing them.
 
 While it lacks the earlier film's flashy comedy and quotable dialogue, "Stardust" possesses enough wit and bravado to make it perfectly charming. Its protagonist, Tristan Thorne (Charlie Cox), lives with his father in the small English village of Wall, named for the cobblestone barrier that skirts it. Beyond the wall lies both Tristan's origins and destiny, and a falling star offers him a chance to win the heart of the haughty Victoria (Sienna Miller), the prettiest girl in the village.
 
 Upon learning of his unusual provenance, Tristan soon finds himself transported to the supernatural world of Stormhold, the enchanted land on the other side of the wall. In the crater where the star landed, he discovers a beautiful young woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes), who, in fact, is the human incarnation of the star. Tristan intends to take Yvaine back to Victoria to prove the depth of his love but must first navigate the treacherous byways of the fantasy kingdom.
 
 That doesn't prove easy, as certain members of Stormhold's citizenry are also interested in Yvaine. Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her witch sisters want the star for her eternal life-giving properties -- which can only be purloined by possessing her still-beating heart. The surviving sons of the dying king (Peter O'Toole) want to regain the gem their father launched into the stratosphere sending Yvaine plummeting to Earth, a gem still in her possession. It is the final piece of a rather bloodthirsty succession ritual that leads Prince Septimus (Mark Strong) and his brothers to kill one another off until the last survivor ascends the throne. As they are dispatched, the slaughtered princes provide a Greek chorus to the story, stuck in limbo until a new king is crowned.
 
 Vaughn keeps the action fast-paced, cutting back and forth between the various factions as they bear down on Yvaine. Scottish and Icelandic locations provide Stormhold with sweeping vistas that allow for sprawling chase scenes and a sense of the epic. The director also has some fun with the swashbuckling derring-do as our neophyte hero, Tristan, gets expert tutelage and a makeover from the colorful captain (Robert De Niro in a role that toys with his usual gruff persona) of a dirigible pirate ship.
 
 Yvaine is an initially churlish presence and Tristan is so preoccupied with his Victoria that their growing attraction to one another sneaks up on them. Similarly, Danes and Cox take a bit of time to warm to one another but eventually create enough of a spark to make the yarn work.
 
 Pfeiffer is terrific as the diabolical Lamia, whose centuries-old visage is showing its years, and Strong, as Prince Septimus, balances her black magic with equally evil ambition. Ian McKellen's narration establishes the storybook tone, and amusing cameos by David Kelly ("Waking Ned"), Rupert Everett and Ricky Gervais help keep the movie's tongue planted firmly in cheek.
 
 Often as dark and brutal as a tale by the Brothers Grimm, "Stardust" is decidedly not for young children. There's an adult sensibility to the romance and the fight scenes are fairly violent. Still, with its heart worn proudly on its sleeve, it's one of the best date movies of the year, a compatibility litmus test for starry-eyed romantics.
 
 
 MPAA rating: PG-13 for fantasy violence and some risque humor. Running time: 2 hours, 2 minutes. In general release.   

The light-fingered romantic fantasy novel Stardust  is a beguiling pastiche of storybook magic that, while you're reading it, all but begs you to imagine it as a movie. That's no surprise, really: Its co-creator, Neil Gaiman, is best known for his graphic novels, such as the celebrated Sandman  series, and like many artists of that form, what he conjures is the imaginative thrill of movement on the page ¬ó a motion picture that plays out in your head in between the panels (or, as in the case of Stardust , the faux-Victorian illustrations). The paradox is that when a literary special-effects novel gets adapted for the screen, the enchanted bits and pieces that were so ingeniously evocative of movies now just look like...standard, derivative movie magic.
In the film version of Stardust , a sorceress waves her hand, and ¬ó poof! ¬ó a man dissolves into a cloud of blue pixie dust, which fades away to reveal that he is now a mouse. The mottled wooden ship of a fearsome buccaneer, played (with a few mincing surprises) by Robert De Niro, sails through the air like a phantom galleon out of a Pirates of the Caribbean  flick. There are ancient witchy sisters, grouchy little men in leprechaun hats, bolts of green fire, and a shooting star that lands on Earth and literally turns into Yvaine (Claire Danes), a beauty who shimmers with a slightly cheesy halo glow. (It's like a '60s Disney effect, and the dress she's wearing shines too: It's silver-blue and looks like something Danes might choose for the Oscars.)
There is also a trio of princes, in stagy-looking beards, who are trying to bump each other off as they compete to take over their late father's throne (each time one of them is killed, he joins the clan's Beetlejuice  gallery of wise-guy black-and-white ghosts); a romantic hero, Tristan, who's sweet and dashing in just nondescript enough a way to make you wonder whether Charlie Cox, the actor playing him, is a budding star or the next Orlando Bloom; and Michelle Pfeiffer as a 400-year-old crone, ripely evil in her leprous plastic age makeup, who wants to find Yvaine and cut out her heart, thus giving herself a fresh jolt of youth. The name of this chararacter is not Witchiepoo, but there are moments when Stardust  resembles nothing so much as the world's most deluxe episode of H.R. Pufnstuf .
But only moments. The movie, with its thrift-shop magic-wand conceits served up with an airy, at times jokey whimsy, evokes a hundred other things you've seen before, but as co-written and directed by Matthew Vaughn (doing a 180 from the blood-soaked gangland trickery of his first film, Layer Cake ), it's deftly put together, with a story that, in its secondhand way, actually gathers steam and makes sense. It's the closest the movies have come in a while to the nudgy, knowing fairy-tale enchantment of The Princess Bride . Stardust , however, will leave you with one nagging question: Is this  what Robert De Niro really thinks is meant by ''fairy tale''?

 In ‚ÄúStardust,‚Äù a sprawling, effects-laden fairy tale with the thundering stamina of a marathon horse race, Michelle Pfeiffer is Lamia, as deliciously evil a witch as the movies have ever invented. Shooting deadly green lightning from rings on her tapering long-nailed fingers, she suggests a seriously lethal beauty contestant of a certain age who will stop at nothing to seize the crown.  As the embodiment of every vain, wicked stepmother in fairy-tale literature mixed with the cauldron-tending crones of ‚ÄúMacbeth‚Äù (Lamia is one of three cackling sisters), Ms. Pfeiffer goes for broke with the relish of a star who figures she has nothing to lose.  The eternal youth and beauty she and her sisters covet can be attained only by cutting out and eating the heart of Yvaine (Claire Danes), an actual fallen star that, upon crashing to the ground in the imaginary kingdom of Stormhold, assumes human form. Yvaine must be found, captured and eviscerated.  But since Lamia has only a limited amount of magic to deploy before she begins to shrivel into a grotesque, balding hag, she must conserve her resources. As fire spirals from her hands like serpent tongues, she metamorphoses from a feline beauty with a sickly sweet smile into various stages of decrepitude. Her nightmare image of herself comes and goes as she unleashes and renews her powers.  By all rights Lamia shouldn‚Äôt be the center of ‚ÄúStardust.‚Äù The spine of the tale is a conventional initiation story in which Tristan (Charlie Cox), a poor young villager from the English town of Wall, promises to bring the prettiest local girl (Sienna Miller) a fallen star like the shooting one that has just zoomed overhead; she gives him a week to deliver.  The town is named after the wall separating the real world from Stormhold, which humans are forbidden to enter, although there is only one ancient guard patrolling the breach. Tristan, whose father broke the rules and leapt through, is a foundling product of his dad‚Äôs liaison 18 years earlier with a witch‚Äôs slave in Stormhold.  ‚ÄúStardust‚Äù is Paramount Pictures‚Äô bid to enter the ‚ÄúLord of the Rings‚Äù-Harry Potter sweepstakes with a splash. Adapted from Neil Gaiman‚Äôs four-book 1997 DC Comics mini-series, which later became a novel, it is conceived by Matthew Vaughn, the director of the seedy British gangster film ‚ÄúLayer Cake,‚Äù as a full-blooded action-adventure fairy tale.  Even when the movie goes haywire with an extraneous comic gambit involving an airborne pirate ship, it barrels forward with a fearless audacity. Far too many characters are crowded together for comfort, and there are serious casting errors, but the movie assumes that its churning energy, lightened with whimsy, will carry the day. And, to an extent, it does.  The most glaring of several mistakes in casting is Ms. Danes‚Äôs charm-free Yvaine, a cranky older version of her teenage character on the television series ‚ÄúMy So-Called Life.‚Äù Even after Yvaine mellows and warms to Tristan, who discovers her in a crater and becomes her protector, Ms. Danes has a distracting habit of scrunching her features into a scowl unbefitting a supernatural heroine who aspires to live happily ever after. At a certain point you may find yourself imagining how much better ‚ÄúStardust‚Äù might have been with Gwyneth Paltrow in the role.  Yvaine is pursued by an entire hunting party‚Äôs worth of characters, whose goals blur into a general stampede. It begins with the death of Stronghold‚Äôs cagey monarch (Peter O‚ÄôToole), who pits his seven sons against one another for the throne, which can be won only through possession of a ruby pendant worn by Yvaine. After fraternal massacre, three brothers remain to fight it out while the others‚Äô ghosts amusedly comment from above like a supernatural Greek chorus.  Beyond Lamia, the movie suffers from a dire lack of strong, clear-cut characters, with one outrageous exception. Halfway through the story, Tristan and Yvaine are rocketed into space, where they eventually plunk down on an amphibious pirate ship suspended from a dirigible. Enter Robert De Niro in his all-time campiest screen performance as its skipper, Captain Shakespeare.  Wearing a demonic grin and speaking in a caricature of the New York mobster voice he used in ‚ÄúAnalyze This,‚Äù he yanks the movie out of its quasi-medieval mists-of-northern-Britain past into a farcical limbo. The fearsome captain is soon revealed to have dual identities. Alone in his quarters, he exchanges his pirate duds for the costume of a cancan-dancing, boa-twirling Folies-Berg√®re chorus girl prancing before a mirror to the sounds of Offenbach. The crew, it turns out, knows about his tendencies but has maintained a respectful silence.  If Mr. De Niro‚Äôs zany drag routine makes as much sense in ‚ÄúStardust‚Äù as a squawking kazoo solo inserted into a Mozart string quartet, it makes movie-trivia sense if you think of it as a hip response to Johnny Depp‚Äôs fey, mascara-wearing ‚ÄúPirates of the Caribbean‚Äù character, Jack Sparrow. In that case, this joke about a joke is either a piece of inspired madcap fun or an excruciating embarrassment.  ‚ÄúStardust‚Äù is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild violence and off-color humor.

Everything but the enchanted kitchen sink shows up in the sprawling fairy tale "Stardust," including evil witches, airborne pirate ships, double-parked unicorns and Robert De Niro as a cross-dressing sea captain. Sprinkled with tongue-in-cheek humor, fairly adult jokes and some well-known faces acting very silly, this adventure story should have particular appeal to fans of "The Princess Bride," but in any event will never be mistaken for a strictly-for-kids movie.
One of the opening scenes (there are several) involves the dubious conception of our hero, Tristan Thorne (Charlie Cox) -- the collaborative effort of a witch's slave (Kate Magowan) and Tristan's wall-jumping father (Ben Barnes). They live in Wall, which separates England from the supernatural kingdom of Stormhold. There, a battle for succession to the throne of the ailing king (Peter O'Toole) rages among seven princes, only three of whom are left alive as the story begins.
There's a lot going on -- at times, perhaps too much -- in "Stardust," which is based on the novel written by Neil Gaiman and illustrated by Charles Vess. The royal rivalries are raging; the dead princes, who appear in black-and-white, are a hilarious Greek chorus, providing play-by-play on the homicidal antics of their surviving brothers. Meanwhile, the young, inept Tristan is wooing the fair Victoria (Sienna Miller) by telling her he'll bring her the fallen star they've seen pass over their heads. Then there's Yvaine (Claire Danes), who is
 the fallen star.
And then there's Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer), the evil witch who wants to cut out Yvaine's still-beating heart and eat it with her horrid sisters so they can prolong their already unnatural youth. The best thing in the film, Pfeiffer shows great comedic timing, and her metamorphoses -- as Lamia careens from flourishing beauty to horrible crone -- show considerable courage, as the actress manages to be funny regardless of what state of decrepitude she's in. It's not a very admirable character, after all: Lamia turns people into goats and goats into people, and she and her sisters foretell the future by hacking up animals and reading their entrails. They're not the most in-demand dinner guests.
Pic saves itself through a lot of incidental humor. Pfeiffer delivers elaborate, well-timed eye-rolls when things like eternal youth don't go her way. De Niro, whose Capt. Shakespeare is so swishy it's amazing he doesn't go overboard (although he does, in a sense), does a "Can-Can" fan dance that, in terms of incongruous collisions of actor and role, is equal to De Niro's performance of "I Feel Pretty" in "Analyze That." The act doesn't have much to do with the "Stardust" story, but it's as engrossing as a car crash.
Typical for a fantasy with love at the center, the romance turns out to be the least interesting thing in the film. Tristan undergoes an extreme makeover over the course of the movie, moving improbably from Edwardian nerd to Byronic swashbuckler; the fit is never quite right. Danes is outright cranky as Yvaine, to the point where viewers may want to hand her over to Lamia.
But the sweep of the story and the humor keep things on something of an even keel. Production values are good, with the more obvious computer-manipulated moments not really distracting from the whole, as the story and the characters are generally cartwheeling around reality anyway.

This is less an adaptation of Neil Gaiman 's 1999 novel than of its dust-jacket synopsis, which will come as disconcerting news to fans of the author's delicate jigsaw-puzzle fantasies. Lost in Stardust  is the poetry of Gaiman's writing, which is replaced by brute-force storytelling. Still, the story itself is sturdy enough to survive, as a young man named Tristan (the incredibly generic Charlie Cox ) endures myriad perils in order to fetch a fallen star that's the object of his alleged true love's deepest desire. Alas, the star's far more than a radiant rock; she's a girl called Yvaine, played by Claire Danes , who's also being chased by a trio of witches, chief among them Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer ), and two would-be kings. Stardust will accrue many comparisons to Rob Reiner 's The Princess Bride , but director Matthew Vaughn 's variation on the theme isn't as playful as Reiner's, and when Stardust  does devolve into comedy, it fails miserably. Robert De Niro  shows up halfway through as a closeted, cross-dressing captain of a high-flying pirate ship, and he's an utter distraction¬óa reminder that, hey, this is just a silly movie about silly things starring famous people acting all silly.
