Call "Never Back Down" "The Karate Kid" for MySpace cadets. Call it "Teen Fight Club." Call it "So You Think You Can Brawl." While you're noticing how this roughhouse drama is just like a bunch of other movies and reality shows, it's worth singling out for courageously showing us what boys really want - sure they're into cars and action and stuff. Some of them even like girls. But what they crave more than anything is to be popular. So thank you "Never Back Down" for confirming what CW has been suggesting for over a year: High school boys are the new high school girls.
Jake (Sean Faris) is the new guy at some Orlando public school (he's a lapsed quarterback from Iowa). Since his dad died in a car accident, he's been moody, petulant, and arrest-prone. Video of his famous "Friday Night Lights"-style gridiron brawl has been virally spread all over his new school, where the kids now check him out in the halls.
It used to be a nice face and good dental work made you a star. Here it's the public awareness that you can knock out a dude's teeth. When Baja (Amber Heard), the school blonde, flirts with Jake over his knowledge of "The Iliad," gives him her number, and invites him to a party, he breaks into a Sunny-D smile.
The party is at somebody's tacky Grecian mansion. It's so Orlando, and it's all good (girls make out in hot tubs; that sort of thing). But then Ryan (Cam Gigandet) introduces himself. He runs the school combat club, and rather than hit Jake with some lame come-on line, he gets right to the point: "I saw the clip, and you can bang." Off comes Ryan's shirt. Jake looks over at Baja, and she looks away. Suddenly, Baja is Mexican for "Dude, I pimped her out to get you here. Now let's fight." But Jake demurs, until Ryan talks trash about his dad. It's not much of a fight. Ryan appears to know Muay Thai and Krav Maga; he's got a ground game. His opponent just wants to box.
The next hour and a half is spent getting Jake in shape for the Beatdown, the movie's climactic fight that doubles as a guerilla social event. His Mr. Miyagi is none other than Djimon Hounsou, playing a Senegalese mixed-martial-arts expert named Jean Roqua. Roqua has had tragedy in his life, too. But for reasons that make no sense, he more or less elects Jake as star pupil. The kid insults the instructor. He breaks all his rules, forcing Roqua to go all Djimon Hounsou on him (the hoarse screaming, the glassy eyes). Then they heal. He's actually less Pat Morita and more Barbra Streisand in "The Prince of Tides."
Jake has the occasional run-in with Ryan. But Ryan is an exhibitionist. Why fight in a bathroom where no one else can see? Save it for the finale. "Never Back Down" has all these television drama properties - the nonstop pop-rock soundtrack, the family angst, the commercial-break story pauses. Plus, wasn't Gigandet that cocky surfer, Kevin, on the "O.C."? Here he's baby Brad Pitt in "Fight Club" - fatless, kind of dangerous but needy: attention is photosynthetic for him. Faris looks like Tom Cruise and the guy who played the most recent Superman.
The movie is interesting for what it implies about Jake and Ryan and their friends. When you take a show like "The Ultimate Fighter" and give it a plot and some acting, the violence is no longer just a sport. It's sex. And when one character is lured into somebody's mansion and beaten almost to death, it's rape. So maybe something really has changed in American high schools. Or maybe this is just the filmmaker's way of making us think something has. Either way, the movie is just a cheesy, preposterous, semi-eroticized way of yelling, "Fight! Fight!," when two people go at it in the school cafeteria.


 A “Fight Club” for high-schoolers, “Never Back Down” offers extreme fighting as the modern-day alternative to sex, drugs and rock ’n’ roll.  Setting the tone immediately, this lunkheaded film by Jeff Wadlow opens with a brawl, from which we gather that the instigator, the Iowa teenager Jake Tyler (Sean Faris), has never heard of anger management. This will become an asset when the family moves to Florida to further the tennis aspirations of Jake’s younger brother (a delightful Wyatt Smith). Enrolled in a high school where social status is determined by the ability to render peers unconscious with your bare hands, Jake finally discovers the therapeutic benefits of breaking faces.  Manifesting all the nuance and insight of a music video, “Never Back Down” plays like a pop-psychology seminar on fathers and sons. As Jake, his schoolyard nemesis (Cam Gigandet) and his martial-arts mentor (a slumming Djimon Hounsou) work out their daddy issues on one another, the movie speeds up and slows down as though controlled by a director in the grip of competing medications. For those who make it to the final beatdown, however, the only pill worth taking is the one that makes you forget.

Though it telegraphs its punches too obviously, the pugilism-and-perspiration epic "Never Back Down" has all the ingredients to be a knockout at the B.O. and in the DVD market. Popularity of the Ultimate Fighting Championship will undoubtedly help, as will the meller�s glorification of violence and rationalization of revenge. Best part, though, is the cast: Everyone�s a model, everyone beats each other half to death, and no one looks as if they�ve ever suffered so much as a coldsore.
Sean Faris, who more than resembles a young Tom Cruise (and no doubt has stable of people promoting that very idea), is Jake Tyler, an angry young man from Iowa who winds up in Orlando, Fla., with his mom (Leslie Hope) and younger brother (Wyatt Smith). He immediately gets drafted into the local fight-club scene via a vicious beating from local bully Ryan McCarthy (Cam Gigandet).
As anyone who has ever seen a boxing movie, any kind of sports movie or even a Western can tell you, the entire narrative will be focused on how, when and why Jake beats the living daylights out of Ryan. This isn't giving anything away, any more than it'd be giving away the plot of summer to say that birds fly south for the winter. The tantalizing question is how the pic will explain all the violence away. "Never Back Down" tries, but not very hard.
Helmer Jeff Wadlow showed promise with "Cry Wolf" (2005), but sometimes seems to think he's directing a commercial for beer, cars and/or feminine hygiene products. So much narrative detail takes place during musical montages that there's barely time to get the requisite mean-spirited violence into the picture. But Wadlow manages.
Faris is fine, but pic has a far more charismatic star in Gigandet, who is gleefully, hatefully sadistic and evil as Jake's more skilled antagonist. Djimon Hounsou, never seen enough, is terrific doing the Pat Morita thing as Jean Roqua, who runs the gym where Jake will learn not just mixed-martial-arts techniques, but life-lessons too, natch.
Amber Heard, on the other hand, has to be seen to be believed. If there were an award for best coyly sexual biting of lower lip by an actress in a leading role, she would win it hands down. Heard plays Baja (yes!), the other side of the Jake-Ryan triangle, and isn't done any favors by all the preposterous slow-mo entrances and babe-alicious posturing. There's more than enough random flesh parading through "Never Back Down" that an actual performance by Heard (soon to be seen, and far more appreciated, in "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane") would have been welcome."Never Back Down" exists in a world of beautiful people, beautiful homes and much unoccupied money, where the rules of physics and physiology are on a serious vacation -- the human body can't do or withstand the things this movie claims it can, and one can only hope that pic's probable success doesn't trigger a dramatic rise in schoolyard body-slams, arm locks and chokeholds.
Production values are first-rate.


With a generic title like Never Back Down —what, was Action-Related Content  already taken?—there's no way this unlikely hybrid of The Karate Kid  and Fight Club  could set your hopes lower without scraping the Mariana Trench . But if you dig the eye-of-the-tiger genre—which rarely rewards anyone who can't pick nits between Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor  and Kickboxer 5: The Redemption —you'll recognize director Jeff Wadlow 's brawny teen melodrama as a modest surprise: better acted than needed, better made than expected. Sean Faris , the evident result of that top-secret Tom Cruise /Ben Affleck /Adam Sandler  gene-splicing experiment, plays the troubled new kid at an Orlando  high school who gets a YouTube-broadcast beatdown from an upper-crust underground fighter (Cam Gigandet ). With the help of a Senegalese Mr. Miyagi (Djimon Hounsou ) and the bully's regretful girlfriend (Amber Heard ), the kid gets his esteem back and loses the chip on his shoulder—but the bully still wants another shot. Chris Hauty 's script hits every predictable plot point, but the engaging cast looks like a portfolio of future stars—especially Faris, a buff beefcake who's self-effacing enough to make a credible underdog—and the bone-jarring fight scenes rock as hard as they're shot and cut. It may be just OK now—but trust me, when it airs at 2 a.m. on Spike between male-enhancement ads, it's gonna look like The Magnificent  freakin' Ambersons .
