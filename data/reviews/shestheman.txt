I'm not that familiar with the ins and outs of Title IX, but if one minute I were on a girls' varsity soccer team and the next minute the team suddenly, male-chauvinistically didn't exist, I'd round up the other girls up for some sort of class-action suit.
Viola, the miffed soccer heroine Amanda Bynes plays in her new movie, has a nuttier idea. She dumps her boyfriend and joins a rival school's team disguised as her twin brother.
The ensuing shenanigans are cataloged in "She's the Man," a screwball comedy that made me wish I were 13 again, because this is precisely the kind of movie I would have gone nuts for in the ninth grade. I probably wouldn't have known to care that the movie crams William Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" into a generic American prep school. I would have just laughed at Bynes's boy drag, which makes her look like a Little Rascal with Irina Slutskaya's haircut.
Viola enrolls at Illyria Prep when her brother Sebastian (James Kirk) sneaks off to London for 12 days to play with his band and asks her to cover for him. But Viola's craftier than that. To become "Sebastian," she enlists her friends, one of whom happens to be a stylist with a confusing resemblance to Jude Law.
At Illyria, the disguised Viola meets her brother's roommate, Duke (Channing Tatum), who notices the tampons in Sebastian's shoe. (They're for nosebleeds.) Later, the balding headmaster (David Cross, of all people) catches Viola scratching her wig and they have a heart-to-heart about coming to terms with hair loss.
On her mild WB sitcom, "What I Like About You," Bynes pretty much plays it straight, but this movie is a license for outlandishness. She delivers a male impersonation that's a hilarious mockery of white suburban masculinity and what a blank slate it can be. In the same sentence, sometimes in the same word, Sebastian sounds like a stoned hip-hop beach bum and a theater queen, voicing lines like "You know it, brah!"
Initially, Duke and the rest of the team find Sebastian's shtick annoying. But after Viola and her stylist concoct a scenario in which two of her hot girlfriends pretend to be obsessed with Sebastian, Duke and the boys worship the impostor. They remain understandably perplexed by his voice's shifting tone and how a soccer ball to the crotch doesn't faze him.
The movie might take the Cliffs Notes approach to Shakespeare (the script is smart, the direction lousy), but the navigation of high-school social politics is refreshingly direct. "She's the Man" says some funny and true things about who is OK to like and who's not. It also happily undercuts its stock characters by threatening to turn them into recognizable people. Duke looks like the quintessential conceited pretty-boy jock, but whenever Olivia (Laura Ramsey) is around he turns to spineless goop.
Olivia doesn't want him, though. She, apparently, prefers her men a little more androgynous, and makes a play for Sebastian. Viola, meanwhile, is falling for Duke and still has to maintain her day job as a reluctant debutante.
"She's the Man" follows "Clueless," "O," and "10 Things I Hate About You" in repurposing literary classics for an American high school setting. "10 Things" was based on "The Taming of the Shrew" and might be worth revisiting just to see Heath Ledger, Julia Stiles, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt before they took on riskier roles.
Some actors in "She's the Man" are also probably headed for bigger, darker things. But I hope Bynes keep it light a little longer. She gawks, mugs, struts, sashays, bugs out, flails, and apes, all while staying pretty cute. It's as if Jerry Lewis learned all his moves by watching Jennifer Aniston on "Friends."


         When her prep school eliminates girls' soccer, star player Viola Hastings (Amanda Bynes) switches teams all the way. Putting shared custody to work for her, she takes the place of her twin brother Sebastian (James Kirk) at his new school, their old school's rival, while he absconds to London with his band. Mom (Julie Hagerty), meanwhile, is too absorbed in the upcoming deb ball to notice, and Dad is out to lunch with his collar turned up. Obviously, conditions couldn't be more perfect for a girl looking to pass as a boy to trounce her ex-boyfriend on the pitch, which is just what she does.
 
  She gets away with it thanks to her stylish hairdresser friend and some coaching in male swagger. As a boy, the doe-eyed, baby-faced Bynes makes a pretty convincing weirdo, and it's a wonder she doesn't ever find herself staring down the barrel of a Kolar during the movie. But her roommate, Duke (Channing Tatum), is not only the soccer team captain, he's also a sensitive guy, and open to ideas. When Viola-as-Sebastian claims the tampons in her luggage are for nosebleeds, he manfully gives them a try.
 


         






    A breezy farce adapted from Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" by first-time screenwriter Ewan Leslie and Karen McCullah and Kirsten Smith ("10 Things I Hate About You" and "Legally Blonde"), "She's the Man" is so good-natured, and its cast seems to enjoy itself so thoroughly, that the total annihilation of disbelief it requires winds up feeling like a reasonable enough request.
 
  Bynes' loony boy shtick is completely unbelievable and thoroughly entertaining. But it's the crush she develops on Duke, who has a crush on Olivia (Laura Ramsey), who has a thing for Sebastian, that brings the movie to life. Furtively mooning over her hunky roommate, Bynes captures adolescent puppy love in all its loopy glory, and it's unexpectedly refreshing to watch a clever girl pursue the dreamy object of her desire.
 
  Surrendering to silliness proves to be a good move; the movie stars David Cross as — what else?— the school's and clueless headmaster, and as the ditzy mom, Hagerty is as breathless and spaced out as ever.
 
  "She's the Man" doesn't attempt to redefine the genre, in the manner of, say, "Ferris Bueller's Day Off." Much of what ends up on-screen feels familiar — the social pariah girl with a retainer echoes a long-ago Joan Cusack; the excellently choreographed soccer sequences recall "Bend It Like Beckham," but there's a sweetness about it that wins you over.
 
 'She's the Man'
 
 MPAA rating:
 PG-13 for some sexual material.   

The press notes for She's the Man  state that it's a teen update of Twelfth Night  (what's next  Paul Walker in To Party or Not to Party? ), but the historical work it reminded me of most was Soul Man , that vintage '80s piffle in which C. Thomas Howell, in a tan-from-the-can, pretended to be black and was so unconvincing at it that your face curdled into a wince. In She's the Man , Amanda Bynes pastes on sideburns and a shaggy bowl-cut wig and struts around in a prep-school jacket attempting to pass herself off as a boy, but Bynes, with her chipmunk cheeks and goggly eyes, comes off more like some bizarre third sex  Davy Jones after an infusion of estrogen. When she tries to talk ''masculine,'' squeaking out lines like ''Hey, bruthuh!'' in a vaguely hip-hop patois, it's so cheesy-wrong that you stare with a mix of fascination and horror.
She's the Man , in which Bynes has to pretend to be her brother to play competitive soccer, is a role-reversal comedy that has almost too much situational structure  the whole Twelfth Night  thing  and not enough scurrilous hilarity. As an actress, Bynes is wholesome to a fault. She impersonates a teenage boy yet never gives him one good dirty thought.


The itch to put on a show propels "She's the Man," a spunky if often erratic update of Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night" to the privileged milieu of contempo American prep schools. Pic marks screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith's second venture with the Bard, although this one lacks much of the cutting wit of their "10 Things I Hate About You" (based on "The Taming of the Shrew"). Teen fave Amanda Bynes mightily struggles with a tricky role --which won't for a second depress what should be sparkling opening frame B.O., with solid grades to come in after-school ancillary class. 
On paper, the idea of modernizing "Twelfth Night," with its array of attractive young people and a smart if headstrong woman talented at disguising herself as a man, is at least as natural as Amy Heckerling's notion a decade ago for turning Jane Austen's "Emma" into "Clueless." Besides, all that Lutz and Smith, along with co-screenwriter, producer and story writer Ewan Leslie and director Andy Fickman, are doing is fundamentally no different than what stage directors routinely do with Shakespeare by lifting it out of its original context.
Showing off her soccer skills over the opening credits, Viola (Bynes) knows she could beat half of the players on the boys' squad at Cornwall Prep, especially since b.f. Justin (Robert Hoffman) has told her so. Still, the school dissolves the girls' team and the boys' coach dismisses any bid by the girls to try out with the guys. Worse, Viola's overweening mom Daphne (Julie Hagerty, in typically sharp form) insists that her tomboy daughter train for coming out as a debutante.
Opportunity strikes, however, when Viola's brother Sebastian (James Kirk), already kicked out of Cornwall and ditching classes at rival Ilyria Prep, flees home (and to his supremely bitchy g.f. Monique, ushered with gusto by Alex Breckinridge) to play with his rock 'n' roll band at a London festival. Having been told that she resembles her brother -- which is a stretch -- Viola determines to disguise herself as Sebastian and get on the Ilyria boys soccer team to get back at Cornwall.
As insistent as its heroine to get its point across, "She's the Man" gathers up enough energy and likeable goodwill that it almost skirts past some extremely strained passages in which Bynes plays out being a boy. While her perf rightly preserves Shakespeare's joke of her lapsing back from time to time into girlish behavior (with some added soccer-inflected jokes), Bynes exaggerates the boyishness into a cartoon that's not only too broad for the camera, but too much for any high school prep jock to take seriously.
The movie's solution is to insist on a strange suspension of disbelief that never fully asserts itself, but the major key to finally making much of it work is the bright and enthusiastic cast, centered on the swarthy and magnetic Channing Tatum as Duke, Ilyria's star player and Viola-Sebastian's roommate. First smitten by cutie Olivia (a charming Laura Ramsey), Duke recruits his roomie -- with "his" ability to know what girls want -- to help hook her up with him.
Of course, Olivia likes Viola-Sebastian, and, when Duke has a moment in the kissing booth during a carnival with the real Viola, he's pulled in another direction. Tatum's emotional turns, more than Bynes' antics, drive the pic into interesting comedic territory.
"She's the Man" reps a multi-faceted project in itself for school age auds -- not only a way to brush up their Shakespeare and for girls to have a keen rooting interest with one of their favorite tube stars and discover a new heart-throb in Tatum -- but for soccer-hungry kids to soak up some terrific moves on the field. Fickman and lenser Greg Gardiner combine with soccer choreographer Dan Metcalfe to stage some visceral action on the pitch, including p.o.v. shots from the angle of players' feet.

Hollywood 's a sucker for cross-dressing, but if you're looking for drag kings , you're pretty much stuck with Yentl . She's the Man , in which a teenage girl must go undercover at a private school to play soccer, doesn't have an unpredictable moment in it, borrowing heavily from just about every sports movie or teen comedy ever and, oh yeah, Twelfth Night . What it does have is teen-queen-turned-drag-king Amanda Bynes , who tackles the lead role of Viola/Sebastian with enough enthusiasm to wring laughs from the retread story. Other rays of light come from the adult supporting cast, particularly David Cross  and Vinnie Jones .
