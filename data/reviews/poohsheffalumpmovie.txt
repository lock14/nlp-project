The Heffalump of "Pooh's Heffalump Movie" is a species of big purple creature that spreads love and cheer to all who encounter it.
No, it's not Barney; it's an elephant. And while it is indigenous to the imaginations of the residents of A.A. Milne's Hundred Acre Wood (Pooh once futilely counted Heffalumps to fall asleep), the creature's arrival as a full-fledged, frolicking character seems more a product of the marketing arm at the Walt Disney Company.
If you're a Milne purist, you've probably stopped reading reviews of the latest installments of the Pooh saga. Of course, if you're between the ages of 2 and 6, your mom, dad, or nanny may be reading this to you. So you deserve to know that "Pooh's Heffalump Movie," with its message of tolerance and open-mindedness, is a fine afternoon at the megaplex. And it will make a welcome addition your home library when it's released on video.
The story follows as Pooh, Rabbit, Piglet, Tigger, and sometimes Eeyore venture out beyond the Hundred Acre Wood to hunt and capture the mythic Heffalump. They seem to think this "horrendous" and "hazardous" creature has a spiked tail, "fiery eyes," and "three horns above and 11 below." Pooh and his pals here represent a bumbling yet paranoid adulthood. They're a sort of lynch mob for a culprit who's guilty only of minding his own business.
In their zeal, they've tainted little Roo, who's too young to come along. But he sneaks into Heffalump Hollow anyway, and finds Lumpy, a kid Heffalump who seems to be missing all the devilish traits that Roo has been programmed to look for. Lumpy even has a nice English accent. Roo puts a leash on his new friend, but after they frolic together, realizes that friends don't tie ropes around friends' necks. The child therefore has an enlightening lesson waiting for the surprisingly dense grownups of Hundred Acre Wood.
The movie's message of tolerance is smartly rendered, if slowly delivered. And loyalists will be pleased to know that the animated art direction hasn't changed much in the 39 years since Disney started filming Milne's books. The verdant backgrounds still have that simple sketched quality that looks handmade, quaint even, in the age of "Shrek" and "The Polar Express." And the black lines that contain the colors of all the characters and objects are as thick as ever. Catchy songs by Carly Simon, who also wrote the numbers for 2003's "Piglet's Big Movie," only enrich the feeling of a movie from another era deposited in a time capsule.
This all lends a lullaby quality to "Pooh's Heffalump Movie" that's pleasing, yet perhaps too effective. I caught more than one parent napping through the screening I attended. And the little boy just behind me observed, like someone slipping into a trance, that the movie was making him sleepy. This is the same person who 10 minutes prior couldn't stop pounding the back of my seat with his foot, and exclaimed "I love this new booster seat! Go booster, go!" as though he were about to sit through "Racing Stripes."
This was only a little less annoying than the representatives of the mutual fund that sponsored the screening, who implored kids to use the word "fidelity" as a password with their parents.
"No commercials!" my neighbor shouted back. He didn't like "Pooh's Heffalump Movie" nearly as much as all the kids who clapped when it was over. But he seemed to appreciate the vanishing purity of going to the movies.


         The Hundred Acre Wood used to be such a nice, quiet neighborhood.
 
  Then one morning the relative calm enjoyed by Winnie the Pooh and his patchwork of friends is shattered by an intruder. A really big intruder. A really loud intruder. Awakened from their slumber, Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, Eeyore and Roo head to the wise but cranky Rabbit's home to discuss what could possibly have left behind the large round footprints and made the thunderous trumpeting noise that disturbed them so.
 


         






    Thus is the setup of "Pooh's Heffalump Movie," the third in the series of new animated films based on the characters created by A.A. Milne, following 2000's "The Tigger Movie" and "Piglet's Big Movie" in 2003. The twist here is the introduction of the aforementioned Heffalump — a species previously seen as an hallucination in 1977's "The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh." Driven by Rabbit's description of the Heffalump as a fearsome behemoth with large menacing horns and a sharply barbed tail, the group, goaded by the adventurous Roo, reluctantly decides to capture the monster.
 
  As plans are made and the necessary tools are gathered, however, Roo is informed that he is much too young for such a dangerous mission.
 
  But in true rebel fashion the little marsupial sets out on his own to snare the beast.
 
  Once he crosses into Heffalump Hollow, Roo encounters a baby Heffalump named Lumpy. A far cry from the terrifying picture painted by Rabbit, Lumpy resembles a cute little mauve elephant who just wants to play and is as frightened by the "creatures" on the other side of the fence as they are of him. The youngsters form a fast friendship and set out to teach their elders a lesson in acceptance.
 
  An innocuous introduction to diversity for the preschool set, "Pooh's Heffalump Movie" features some charming songs by Carly Simon and is warmly animated so as to evoke nostalgia in parents. The Heffalumps are seamlessly incorporated into the milieu, gently fitting in with all the familiar elements. Pooh craves his hunny, Eeyore mopes and Tigger pogos and woo-hoos with aplomb, making the Hundred Acre Wood the warmly remembered place it has been for more than 75 years.

I know what you're thinking: Aren't Heffalumps like closet monsters, inventions of a fearful Piglet-brain? Not anymore. In Disney's latest expansion of Pooh Corner , the already xenophobic Hundred Acre Wood community (remember how they reacted when single-mom Kanga moved in?) gets riled over perceived incursions by these elephantine bêtes noires, long feared but (crucially) never glimpsed. It's a call for Rabbit-sponsored alarm, but it's also a chance for little Roo (developmentally delayed by all those Carly Simon-penned songs his mother sings him) to prove he's grown-up enough for a Heffa-hunt. When he meets Lumpy (irresistibly voiced by 8-year-old Brit Kyle Stanger), the martial tone softens and lessons of tolerance are learned. What was accomplished with quiet nuance in A. A. Milne's stories (where Roo himself was the outsider) is all melodramatic fanfare here; but if you're willing to accept the initial betrayal of the mythos, Pooh's Heffalump Movie  is a harmless little ''ex-po-tition'' (to use a Pooh-ism). Still, making this your kids' first Pooh experience would be like weaning them on New Coke.

n A. A. Milne's Winnie the Pooh stories, written in the 1920's, Piglet once thought he had seen a heffalump, but it was really just Pooh running around with a honey jar stuck on his head. In "Pooh's Heffalump Movie," which is adorable, he finally encounters the real thing. And it (the heffalump) is too cute for words. With traditional Disney animation and the pastel colors of the Hundred Acre Wood,  where the Pooh tales  are set, Milne's characters gather again, reduced to simple personality types. Piglet is afraid, Eeyore is gloomy, Tigger is self-involved, little Roo is curious, and Pooh is Pooh, making excuses and being generally clueless. (When Piglet leaves a trail of jelly beans so they won't become lost in the forest, Pooh, not getting the idea, blithely eats them one by one as they go along.) The animals have heard a frightening noise coming from Heffalump Hollow and conclude that it must be one of the area's scary-monster namesakes. Everybody says heffalumps are very frightening, dangerous and mean, with spiky tails. But the group screws up its collective courage and sets out on an expedition to find and capture one. But it's little Roo, whom they consider too young to go along, who happens upon a heffalump, a very young one whose nickname is Lumpy. Roo explains to his find that he has come to capture him. Great, capture me, Lumpy says agreeably. At this point, adults as well as children may fall in love with Lumpy, partly because he's a sort of roly-poly lavender baby elephant but even more because of the endearing voice and infectious laugh of Kyle Stanger, a very young Briton making his movie and voice-over debut. The other voice-over actors do fine jobs, including Brenda Blethyn as Lumpy's considerably larger but equally gentle mother. And Carly Simon has written four charming children's songs for the film, three of which she performs. But in the end, it's all about Kyle, age 8, whom I would very much like to adopt. Roo persuades Lumpy to leave his part of the world and come over to the Hundred Acre Wood, where they romp, giggle and get into a little trouble. When the other animals come across the broken honey pots and the ravaged garden of pumpkins, watermelons and carrots they have left behind (the kids were hungry, O.K.?), they interpret it as destruction by a frightening creature and set out numerous traps. Two 4�-year-olds sitting in the row in front of me seemed to be enjoying the film. The loudest children's laughter in the theater followed Pooh's falling out of bed and into a honey pot, Tigger's falling on Rabbit and Rabbit's being tied up with rope from head to toe. The smallest moviegoers may not realize they are being taught a crucial lesson about fearing the unknown and the dangers of misjudging people just because they are different from you, but there it is. "He's just like us," Roo explains to his friends, who are initially terrified of Lumpy. "He gets afraid. He likes honey. He even learned how to bounce.

So insubstantial that it practically evaporates on screen, "Pooh's Heffalump Movie" likely will play best with toddlers and pre-schoolers easily amused by bright colors, merry songs and lovable, huggable toon animals. One of the lesser entries in Disney's ongoing "Winnie the Pooh" franchise, modest and muted pic won't be around long in theatrical run, but should prove quite popular down the line as the homevid equivalent of a pacifier.
While Christopher Robin makes only a token appearance during closing credits, most other popular A.A. Milne characters are on hand to go through familiar paces in Hundred Acre Wood. Wispy scenario calls for Pooh (voiced by Jim Cummings), Tigger (also Cummings), Piglet (John Fiedler), Rabbit (Ken Sansom) and Eeyore (Peter Cullen) to be greatly distressed by evidence that a dreaded "Heffalump" (i.e., elephant) has been roaming in their general vicinity.
While Team Pooh attempts to capture the dangerous creature in a far-flung corner of the wood, spunky little Roo (Nikita Hopkins) befriends a not-so-dangerous young Heffalump named Lumpy (Kyle Stanger). As the new buddies gambol and frolic to the strains of Carly Simon's pleasantly innocuous original tunes, they find they're not so different after all. Better still, their peaceful coexistence inspires greater trust between their initially mistrustful elders.
Even though it clocks in at 67 minutes, including credits, "Pooh's Heffalump Movie" feels unduly padded. Indeed, it's hard to shake the impression the project was intended as a direct-to-video release, and somehow got misrouted on its way to retail outlets. Overall, animation is unremarkably bland, with backgrounds and landscapes conspicuously lacking detail. Vocal talents -- including Brenda Blethyn as Mama Heffalump and Kath Soucie as Kanga, Roo's mommy -- aren't unduly taxed.
Of course, in this age of the Professionally Outraged, it's altogether possible that some pressure group will huff and puff about "Heffalump." After all, pic preaches a message of tolerance and mutual acceptance while dealing with a lavender 
elephant -- no, I'm not making this up -- who's ultimately embraced by "normal" animals of more traditional hues. Wait until the folks who were upset by Teletubbies and Buster Rabbit get a load of this.
