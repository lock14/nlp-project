Anyone who watched (and probably wept his or her way through) the swoony 2004 melodrama The Notebook
 knows Cassavetes is not a man to leave a spot of sap untapped, and in My Sister's Keeper
, he pulls out a very big drill indeed. Enter another notebook, this one the memory book of teenage cancer patient Kate Fitzgerald (Vassilieva), into which she pastes the photos and bric-a-brac of her short but fraught life with a family at war. Generalissima is mother Sara (Diaz), a former lawyer who quit her job to devote herself full-time to battling Kate's cancer. Sara attacks with a single-minded ferocity, one that stretches to the ethically questionable decision to engineer with her firefighter husband, Brian (Patric), a genetically compatible "designer baby" named Anna (Breslin). The film's timeline jags here and there, but it opens more or less at a crucial juncture, when Anna, now 11, hires an ambulance-chasing lawyer (Baldwin) to sue her parents for her medical emancipation. After years of enduring painful and invasive procedures to prolong her sister's life, Anna is balking at her next surgery � a kidney transplant that would have an unquestionable impact on her future quality of life but without which Kate would surely die. Despite Joan Cusack's lovely, understated turn as the judge assigned to Anna's case, there's very little meat on the bone of this legal subplot; it seems to only intermittently hold the attention of Cassavetes and his co-writer Jeremy Leven. That unfocused feel runs throughout, from the opening frames' heavy use of a voiceover that bounces from one character to the next (which, I'm told, mimics the shifting point of view of Jodi Picoult's bestselling source novel) to several imagistic, toeing-indulgent montages, including one devoted to Brian and Sara's neglected son, Jesse (Ellingson), set rather perplexingly to a guitar-strummed cover of "Girls Just Want to Have Fun." The spectrum swings wide between moments like this � moments of an almost bewildering tonal ungainliness (as when Baldwin, in his signature ham-gruff growl, voices-over "The kid wasn't lying" like some Sam Spade wannabe) � to the opposite extreme of the pat and predictable in both plot and dialogue. (Won't someone please, please close the book on characters shouting out, "I'll see you in court!"?) Still, what Cassavetes can do without a doubt is pull terrific performances from his actors: He corralled a cast of pretty, milky young things in 2007's overlooked Alpha Dog
 and extracted a rare romanticism from Sean Penn a decade earlier in She's So Lovely
. Diaz's shrillness works here to her advantage (although she doesn't feel quite old enough, or ragged enough, to play a materfamilias), while Patric takes a scripted saint and makes a living, breathing, bruised but not broken man out of him. The actors, likable to a one, burrow their way in to even this most resistant of hearts, so that when two characters push a box of Kleenex back and forth between them, one can't help but sniffle in tandem. Unsubtleties be damned, our defenses fall. Meanwhile, Cassavetes' reign as the go-to waterworks man remains uncontested.

The domestic afflictions in “My Sister’s Keeper’’ pile onto the Fitzgerald family with biblical fury. Sixteen-year-old Kate (Sofia Vassilieva) has battled leukemia for most of her life. Eleven-year-old Anna (Abigail Breslin) has had it with being a “donor child,’’ born to provide marrow and tissue for her sister, and is suing for legal emancipation. Oldest son Jesse (Evan Ellingson) is dyslexic and doing something naughty downtown.
A pall of disaster, in fact, hangs over everyone in this shapeless, hankie-wringing adaptation of the best-selling Jodi Picoult novel. The judge in the case (Joan Cusack) is mourning a daughter dead in an accident, and Anna’s lawyer (Alec Baldwin) keeps a service dog around for reasons that become clear late in the film. And there’s the children’s mother, Sara (Cameron Diaz), a monster of maternal denial so steely she could have been played by Joan Crawford in her fire-breathing prime.
For all that, devoted fans of Picoult’s books  - hot-button family melodramas that never let up  - may be most distressed by the violence done to the source. In bringing “My Sister’s Keeper’’ to the screen, co-writer/director Nick Cassavetes (“The Notebook’’) jettisons characters, drops plotlines, obscures a few motivations, and completely changes the author’s original ending. This book hasn’t been adapted, it’s been taken outside and shot.
That’s not such a bad idea, really. Picoult offered readers a hugely contrived final twist that multiplex audiences would probably have rejected en masse. What we get, instead, is weepy closure slightly more in keeping with the way life (or the movies) actually works. Yet “My Sister’s Keeper’’ is still a well-intentioned mess, peppered with strong performances and gripping moments but unable to get around the book’s lack of a strong central story line.
Actually, the novel’s spine is Kate’s cancer  - every action and reaction radiates out from her disease. And “My Sister’s Keeper’’ is very lucky to have the unknown Vassilieva in the role, rooting the film in her character’s quiet, rebellious strength even as her body fails in horrible ways. This is a movie where the vomited blood looks real but the torrential emotions never stick.
Cassavetes follows little Anna as the court case proceeds  - Breslin (“Little Miss Sunshine’’) coasts on her natural warmth here, which is fine  - then hops to the struggle between Sara and her mellow-dude fireman husband Brian (Jason Patric) to define Kate’s final months, then halfheartedly follows Jesse as he does not much of anything. In the process, the film’s dramatic tension just dribbles away. The one section of “My Sister’s Keeper’’ that feels right and true is Kate’s brief romance with a fellow cancer patient (Thomas Dekker, very good), but even that is resolved in a frustratingly unresolved manner.
Left on their own, the actors bear down or drift away. Cusack twitches entertainingly; Baldwin, asked to play a good and decent man, has no idea how to proceed. Stepping further out onto the dramatic limb she explored in “In Her Shoes,’’ Diaz at least gets her hooks into the dilemma that drives her character relentlessly forward: A corporate lawyer on long-term leave, Sara treats her daughter’s cancer as a case she can’t afford to lose. The role’s a rich piece of Bad Mom melodrama, and a more daring actress might have taken it to operatic heights. Diaz either won’t or can’t quite get it there.
The movie has excised the book’s Big Lulu toward the end, but there is a more modest climactic twist. Unfortunately, it has the effect of rendering everything we’ve seen up to now beside the point, and “My Sister’s Keeper’’ stands revealed for what it is: disease-of-the-week exploitation with a few topical issues frosted on. If you respond  - and there was plenty of discreet sobbing in the screening I attended  - it’s only because Vassilieva makes you care for her character, a believable teenage girl whose disease has only made her stronger. She’s a saint, but she’s one we can live with.

         Sadness settles into "My Sister's Keeper" like rain over Seattle in this troubling and troublesome drama of a dying child, the sister who has been created to save her and the family that is wasting away alongside of her.

Starring Cameron Diaz as the mother, Abigail Breslin as Anna the sister/donor and an especially fine Sofia Vassilieva as Kate, with a lifetime of pain filling her 15 years, how could you not be moved by director Nick Cassavetes' latest effort? 



         






  That seems to be exactly what Cassavetes is asking -- no, demanding -- as he puts us directly in the path of this emotional tsunami of a film that makes his prior weepie, "The Notebook," a tale of love and death wrapped in the arms of Alzheimer's, look sentimentally cheerful by comparison. 

It is a thoroughly modern and extremely fraught dilemma that the Fitzgerald family faces. It's one that author Jodi Picoult first explored in her novel on which the film is based, when medical technology has far outpaced ethical debate and legal restraint on what can and should be done to save a life. 

 Sara (Diaz) and Brian (Jason Patric) are the perfect couple, with two perfect children, Jesse (Evan Ellingson) and Kate, until Kate is diagnosed with leukemia and their world shifts from sunny days at the beach to doctors' offices and hospital corridors. When no genetic match can be found for much of what ails Kate, a doctor quietly suggests Sara and Brian "create" one. 

That "little piece of blue sky" as her mother calls her, is Anna, made possible through the miracle of a petri dish, a lot of science and some very good timing. She is loved, that much is clear, but also used -- her blood and bone marrow siphoned off starting not long after her birth -- and she wonders, as we do, would she even exist if her sister weren't sick. Now they need one of her kidneys in the latest bid to save Kate.

In a decision that will test the family possibly more than Kate's illness, and what becomes the ethical core of the film, Anna says no dice and hires an attorney (Alec Baldwin) to fight for medical emancipation from her parents.

 It is, of course, more complicated than that. There are multiple back stories and unspoken agendas at work, both inside the family and out, and borrowing from the book's narrative style, the film uses voice-over to tell much of it.

 Those disconnected voices floating over director of photography Caleb Deschanel's beautifully evocative images give the film an unsettling, almost music video feel. Unwittingly, that turns out to be a gift, creating much-needed emotional distance.


There is always a fine line between moving and manipulation in telling heartbreaking stories, and it is here that Cassavetes largely fails us. Where restraint might have raised up "My Sister's Keeper," a heavy hand has brought it down. 

Still, it is good to see Diaz tackling a role that requires more than her good looks and Crest Whitestrips smile. Her character is as close as the film comes to having a villain, unless you count the doctor who set all this in motion.

 The actress finds her center in an anger born of helplessness, and it radiates in the tension in her bones and the fear in her eyes. But even as she's grilled on the witness stand, her calculated choice of one child's health over another exposed, it's hard to think of this desperate mother as a monster.





   

Judging from the snuffling heard around me and the spontaneous production of my own cheap tears, My Sister's Keeper  does exactly what it's supposed to do: The sinus-clearing movie makes us feel luxuriously sad that, despite the love of attractive families and the best medical care, some kids get cancer.
But because we live in a post-St. Elsewhere  world of plot-enhancing ethical complications, this particular luxuriously sad story, based on a best-selling novel by skilled tear-wrencher Jodi Picoult, isn't content with the simple challenges of life-threatening illness. While the sick teen girl, Kate (Medium 's Sofia Vassilieva), is a beaming beacon of bald-headed grace, the spotlight belongs to her younger sister, Anna (Abigail Breslin). Anna was genetically engineered and conceived by her parents (Cameron Diaz and Jason Patric) to supply spare parts to her ailing older sibling. And now Anna wants to sue for medical emancipation because, she says, she's tired of being a human pin cushion. Alec Baldwin adapts his sitcommy 30 Rock  persona only slightly to play her showboating lawyer.
Picoult's fans are treated to a fair dose of the author's page-turning stuff, including a subplot about Kate's chaste cancer-ward romance. The extra cinematic shine, meanwhile, is the specialty of director Nick Cassavetes and screenwriter Jeremy Leven, who painted and plastered over literary mush in The Notebook . Their message in My Sister's Keeper ? Cancer sucks, but there's always the balm of beach scenes and an emo soundtrack.

 The prospect of a child’s death is so awful that to broach it in a movie or a book requires a special measure of caution and sensitivity. Or so you might think. But at least since Victorian novelists from Charles Dickens to Louisa May Alcott dispatched under-age angels to heaven on cataracts of tears, dead or dying kids have provided ready catharsis and money in the bank. In modern day commercial fiction, and in Hollywood movies, childhood mortality is handled with sometimes cynical care. It can authorize righteous, vengeful violence or else reawaken the dormant possibilities of melodrama. Nothing else quite guarantees the same queasy intensity of feeling.  “My Sister’s Keeper,” based on a best-selling novel by Jodi Picoult, is an unapologetic — shameless? ruthless? — weepie, exploiting the grave illness of a lovely, lively, blameless girl from start to finish. But it has ambitions beyond mere ghoulish mawkishness. The director, Nick Cassavetes, has in the past, in movies like “The Notebook” and “John Q,” attempted a kind of honest manipulation, wringing outsize waves of emotion out of more or less ordinary situations, and trying to hold on to some notion of realism in the process.  In this film, he assembles an able cast into a family defined and distorted by the leukemia of their older daughter and middle child, Kate (Sofia Vassilieva). Kate’s disease was diagnosed when she was a toddler, and to save her life her parents, Sara (Cameron Diaz) and Brian (Jason Patric), conceived another daughter, Anna (Abigail Breslin), who was genetically engineered to be a perfect donor of blood, marrow and whatever else Kate might need. Most of this is told through flashbacks, as each member of the family — there is also an older brother, Jesse (Evan Ellingson) — takes a turn providing voice-over narration and giving his or her own perspective on the story so far.  In the present, Anna has engaged a lawyer — a marvelously florid Alec Baldwin — to represent her in a suit against her parents. She wants to be medically emancipated, and not compelled to give up the kidney her sister now desperately needs. Her action sends a shock wave through the family, enraging her mother and throwing what had seemed to be agreed-upon principles into doubt. And yet, because of their long habits of comfort and care, the five Fitzgeralds seem to hang together in spite of Anna’s apparent betrayal.  Her suit raises some interesting ethical and legal issues, which are passed over rather lightly as the case comes before a judge (Joan Cusack) who has recently lost her own daughter. Do Anna’s rights to govern her own body trump her obligations to the sister she claims to love? Is she prepared to let Kate die?  But ethics are secondary to psychology, which is explored with varying degrees of superficiality and plausibility. Ms. Diaz is entirely believable as an ambitious, tough-minded woman whose ferocious protectiveness makes her at once heroic and a little monstrous, and Ms. Breslin and Ms. Vassilieva both nimbly navigate tricky roles, finding a vein of humor that undercuts some of the maudlin moments and adds to the emotional impact of the story.  Which is a bit too firmly wired into the premise. Mr. Cassavetes, who wrote the script with Jeremy Leven, has changed some  details of Ms. Picoult’s novel, in particular by taking out a grotesquely shocking plot twist and replacing it with one that is mildly surprising, even as it reveals some of the film’s themes to be red herrings.  Other themes are less clearly considered than they might have been. At times, “My Sister’s Keeper” manages to be quietly insightful. A touching subplot, traced in a long, patient flashback, about a romance between Kate and a young fellow cancer patient (Thomas Dekker) is one of the few extended passages in the film that have some of the fine grain of lived experience. In general, though, Mr. Cassavetes writes in the shorthand of sentimentality rather than the prose of real feeling, relying on montage sequences, blackout cuts, the mellow golden hues of Caleb Deschanel’s cinematography and a heart-tweaking musical soundtrack as a substitute for hard dramatic work.  The tears arrive on cue, and to the extent that Ms. Vassilieva has embodied an authentic adolescent rather than a symbol of suffering, they are earned. But the film cannot quite decide what to make of the Fitzgerald family tragedy. It tries, to some extent, to resist the temptation to spiritualize Kate by finding meaning or comfort in her terrible situation even as it succumbs, in the end, to creepy and unconvincing redemptive impulses. “My Sister’s Keeper” takes on a very tough subject — and has, in Anna and Kate, two pretty tough characters played by strong young actresses — but ultimately it is too soft, too easy, and it dissolves like a tear-soaked tissue.  “My Sister’s Keeper” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some under-age misbehavior, occasional strong language and some upsetting hospital scenes.

There's crying and vomiting aplenty in "My Sister's Keeper," and audiences may be forgiven the urge to respond in kind. Unsubtle, uneven and undeniably effective, this take-no-prisoners cancer weepie poses a fascinating moral quandary -- a girl fighting her parents for the right to control her body while her older sister wastes away from leukemia -- as a mere pretext for a full-scale assault on the viewer's tear ducts. To the extent that many will deem the assault highly successful, Warner's "Keeper" could be a sleeper, especially as a femme-friendly alternative to the latest "Transformers."
Adapted from Jodi Picoult's 2004 bestseller, "My Sister's Keeper" is the saga of the long-suffering Fitzgerald family, pivoting on a crucial moment in the lives of two sisters: teenage Kate, who was diagnosed with leukemia at an early age and has been in and out of hospitals ever since, and 11-year-old Anna, who was conceived in vitro as a perfect genetic match for Kate -- a living repository of blood, bone marrow and other bodily resources.
So when Anna marches into a lawyer's office and announces her decision to sue for "medical emancipation" -- which would free her from her obligation to donate the kidney that could save Kate's life -- their parents feel understandably shocked and betrayed. Their dad, Brian (Jason Patric), takes the news better than mom Sara (Cameron Diaz), who is fiercely and overbearingly devoted to Kate's welfare, often to the neglect of her husband, younger daughter and son Jesse (Evan Ellingson).
Writer-director Nick Cassavetes and co-scribe Jeremy Leven retain Picoult's technique of narrating the story from multiple points of view, interwoven with flashbacks that trace Kate's declining health and its impact on the family at every stage. While the device feels arch and clunky in its attempt to accommodate the perspectives of five characters, giving short shrift to some (the script regards Jesse with scarcely more interest than Sara does), it does reinforce the idea of the family as a fragmented unit, whose members find themselves at odds in matters of life and death.
Cassavetes was arguably well prepped for this film, having directed one crowdpleasing tearjerker ("The Notebook") and grappled with medical ethics, sort of, in "John Q." Yet the lack of tonal discipline evident in his past work is also present here, as the story's stew of family angst, terminal-illness melodrama and courtroom theatrics produces a dangerously unstable mixture of moods. Early scenes bog down in shrill bickering (mostly courtesy of Diaz, using Sara's brittle edges as an excuse to crank up the volume), chased into temporary remission by upbeat moments of family bonding.
Yet Cassavetes also is capable of a softer touch, which he demonstrates in a poignant, extended flashback to Kate's romance with a dreamy fellow patient (Thomas Dekker). As lovely images of the past insistently tug our attention away from the present, some of the drama's more pertinent questions -- what motivates Anna's sudden self-interest? What's it like to live with your parents when you're suing them? -- are casually glossed over. Too much scrutiny, it turns out, would spoil the climactic twist.
It's that calculated sense of dramatic evasion that makes "My Sister's Keeper" feel all too convenient as it short-circuits its own philosophical/scientific provocation and instead goes for the viewer's jugular. To that end, Cassavetes falls back on a reliable combo of heart-tugging music (either mood-setting pop tunes or Aaron Zigman's tastefully downbeat score) and repeated shots of a bald, feeble Kate beaming angelically through her tears. In the face of such an impeccably mounted emotional onslaught, what argument can there be?
That the film does come by some of its tears honestly is a testament to the actors involved, including Patric as the selfless, quietly resilient dad; Diaz, whose perf improves in direct relation to her character's mood; Baldwin, offering dry comic relief as Anna's attorney; and Joan Cusack, quietly wrenching as a judge who proves sympathetic to both parties. Special mention must also be made of Vassilieva, who endures the ravages of onscreen cancer (nosebleeds, deathly pale makeup, the aforementioned vomiting) like a champ, and who as a result easily steals the film from the plucky, always engaging Breslin.
Tech credits are pro but not too polished; there's a rough texture to Caleb Deschanel's lensing that suits the story's bittersweet feel. Pic makes fine use of its Southern California locations, particularly during a beachside interlude.

Eleven-year-old Anna Fitzgerald's parents didn't just plan for her—they customized her in utero, with the specific end of providing spare parts and infusions for her leukemia-sick older sister, Kate (Sofia Vassilieva ). When Kate relapses, experiencing renal failure, Anna (Abigail Breslin ) defies her birthright duty to play donor and cough up a kidney. She contacts TV-spot lawyer Campbell Alexander  (Alec Baldwin , possibly the only actor who doesn't cry on-screen), who agrees to help her win medical emancipation. Before mom Sara (Cameron Diaz ) quit work to scrutinize her daughter's cell count, she was a lawyer herself, which sets the stage for a family catharsis in the courtroom. Screenwriter Jeremy Leven and director Nick Cassavetes , who previously jackpotted with The Notebook , reunite to adapt another heartstrings molester. From a 2004 Jodi Picoult  bestseller, My Sister's Keeper  mashes Death Be Not Proud  with Irreconcilable Differences . The film is extraordinarily explicit in showing the effects of disease and what's involved in caring for the sick. You don't usually see this unblinking attention to the progress of physical decay in a PG-13 wide-release movie, and to the degree that it represents a real aspect of human experience generally curtained out of sight, it is, in the language of movie people, a brave decision. But makeup department realism alone can't redeem the dramatic fallacies surrounding it.
