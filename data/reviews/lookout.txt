If the army of psychologists, life coaches, and TV therapists who have become the shamans of our quick-fix age is to be believed, the first step toward absolution is simply forgiving yourself. No fasting, Hail Marys, or hair shirts required. The same holds true in Hollywood, a world where Robin Williams has only to repeat the phrase �It�s not your fault� a dozen times to a weepy Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting
 to set him on the path to redemption. Forgive yourself, our psychiatrists and screenwriters tell us, and the whole world forgives with you. Chris Pratt (Gordon-Levitt), the hero of The Lookout
 (which premiered in Austin at the SXSW Film Festival), could use a little forgiveness. It�s been four years since an act of youthful recklessness resulted in a car wreck that led to the deaths of two of his best friends and left him with brain damage severe enough to impair his motor skills, cloud his memory, and impel him to throw out squeamishly inappropriate pickup lines in bars. Now he�s essentially a functioning invalid, dependent on a collection of scribbled reminders on note cards and the generosity of others to keep him alive while he splits his time between rehabilitative life-skills classes, a dead-end janitorial job, and return trips to the scene of the accident, where he relives his crime over and over again in his head, searching for some peace of mind. Which can be hard to find when your mind is little more than a dish of scrambled eggs that�s only recently begun to coalesce back into something you have any control over; poor Pratt can barely remember where the can opener is, much less discern the difference between an accident and mortal sin. Smelling an opportunity, a seductive criminal named Gary Spargo (Goode) and his partner, a former exotic dancer seductively named Luvlee Lemons (Fisher), convince Pratt to take part in a robbery at the bank where he works. Pratt�s involvement leads him on a precipitous downward spiral into a world of nasty, black-clad gangsters and shootouts with the cops, but writer/director Frank deflects any moral judgment with the fiendishly clever argument that any action taken in the name of your own independence and emotional solace can�t be all bad. The Lookout
 marks Frank�s directorial debut after years of working as a screenwriter on movies like Get Shorty
 and Out of Sight
, and though his new movie may lack the sexual tension and bubbly wit that elevated those films to rarefied heights, there�s a newfound, and not unwelcome, sobriety to his writing. It�s hard to imagine George Clooney and Jennifer Lopez ruminating on atonement in the trunk of a getaway car. But then, it�s a lot easier to engage in witty banter when you�ve got your wits about you. (See p.52 of this week's Screens section for an interview with Scott Frank.)



A modestly effective thriller about a lost boy who falls in with a nasty pack of bank robbers, "The Lookout " promises minor pleasures and delivers them. In the process, it's gracious enough to kick in a few extras: a nifty central gimmick, a self-effacing lead performance, and a big slice of ham from supporting actor Jeff Daniels .
We've seen rich high school kid Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) live fast and almost die young in the film's eerie opening scene, and as the story proper begins, he's still dealing with the consequences of a massive head injury four years later. In particular, Chris has difficulty "sequencing" -- remembering in what order to do things. This makes opening a can of tomatoes a psychological obstacle course, one of hundreds he faces every day.
Chris goes to therapy sessions, shares an apartment with a sardonic blind man named Lewis (Daniels ), and cleans the floors at a small-town bank. Guilt, lost glory, and a cold businessman father (Bruce McGill ) combine to send him into the hands of Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode ), a former school chum turned very bad man. Gary and his friends want to rob Chris's bank, and they need his help.
That's it, pretty much. "The Lookout" has the economy and some of the artistry of a low-budget thriller from the '50s: a curt acknowledgement that blood will out and you might as well pay attention to the characters.
There are four of any consequence. Goode's Gary is an insinuating barroom charmer with flashes of violence just under the surface. It's hard to believe Goode is British, since there are guys like Gary waiting to beat you up in pool halls across America.
Isla Fisher , the sweet nutcase from "Wedding Crashers ," plays an ex-stripper who holds on to her stage name like a security blanket -- Luvlee Lemons (it may be the only creative thing she has done in her life). Gary uses her to seduce Chris, and Fisher gives the character a dim, honest integrity, as if the old film noir moll Gloria Grahame had been reborn as a pole dancer.
Daniels just has fun as Lewis, a character who gets all the good lines and knows it. Blind though he is, Lewis has seen plenty and not even a shotgun stuck in his face fazes him. That's a B-movie conceit, but, look, it's a B-movie.
Maybe that's why Gordon-Levitt looks confused, though, as if he expected this movie to be the next "Memento " and therefore a logical progression from his 2006 arthouse hit "Brick ." Or maybe he's just getting inside Chris's fractured head. The actor gives a tight, unshowy performance but it only comes to life in the final scenes, when everything hinges on Chris getting a lot of complicated things in order or else.
The writer-director is Scott Frank , a screenwriter of "Minority Report ," "Get Shorty ," and many other films , who here steps behind the camera for the first time. If he has consciously created a story line so simple it ultimately seems undercooked, that may just be part of the learning curve.
He probably knows "The Lookout" will look just fine when you stumble up on it on late-night cable a few months from now. And he gets enough right here that whatever he does next, some of us will be paying attention.


         Director Scott Frank brings a writer's ear for language to 'The Lookout,' a skillful thriller."The LOOKOUT" is a writer's thriller. True, it's cleanly and efficiently directed, and it showcases some crackerjack acting, but the reason it's a real pleasure to watch is that a writer's sensibility is the foundation everything is built on.
 
 It doesn't hurt, of course, that the writer in question is Scott Frank, here making his directing debut. Frank's credits include the notable adaptations "Get Shorty" and "Out of Sight," and when he has one of his characters say, "everything is a story, stories help us make sense of the world," you know he believes every word.
 


         






   Frank has come up with an involving twist on traditional thriller material, but what makes "The Lookout" distinctive is its strong sense of character. It's that uncommon genre film that has invested time and skill in creating convincing, carefully constructed personalities. And not just one or two but some half a dozen.
 
 That in turn has led to a series of eye-catching performances from high-caliber folks like star Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeff Daniels, Matthew Goode, Isla Fisher and Carla Gugino. The characters they play may have started as genre types, but by the time Frank and the cast have done their work, they have both texture and individuality.
 
 A prologue introduces Gordon-Levitt's Chris Pratt at what began as one of the peak events of his young life: He's driving his beautiful girlfriend (Gugina) and another couple out into the Kansas countryside late at night to see a gorgeous display of mating fireflies.
 
 But the unexpected happens, as it often does in thrillers, and, as someone later says, "you woke up this other guy." A head injury caused by a terrible accident turns Chris, the golden-boy high school athlete, into a person we immediately sense, just by hearing the change in Gordon-Levitt's voice, could not be more different.
 
 The new Chris is a slower, more damaged individual.He easily gets frustrated, confused and angry, he sometimes cries for no reason, he's prone to blurting out inappropriate comments and, like Guy Pearce's character in "Memento," he needs to write everything down if he's to have even a prayer of remembering it.
 
  Someone like Chris can'tbe allowed to live alone, especially in the small town of Noel, Kan., where he works as the night janitor for a shoebox-sized bank. His roommate turns outto be "The Lookout's" mostunexpected character, a sar-castic, outlandish blind man named Lewis (Daniels) who wears porkpie hats and jokes about things like having "a gimp's night out."
 
 As his knockout work in "Good Night, and Good Luck" and "The Squid and the Whale" demonstrated, Daniels is having a second coming as a mature actor. His ability to fully inhabit unanticipated characters underlines a gift for breathing vivid life into whatever he turns his hand to that is not used nearly often enough.
 
 Though Daniels' success is not a surprise, what Goode does with Gary Spargo is. A classically trained British actor who played Scarlett Johansson's fiancé in Woody Allen's "Match Point," Goode is eerily compelling as an American smooth talker who chats up our lonely protagonist in a local bar and adroitly takes advantage of him in ways the audience senses well before Chris does.
 
 It's through Gary that Chris meets Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher, not at all the way she was in "Wedding Crashers"), a part-time exotic dancer whose relationship with Chris surprises first him and then herself.
 
 Also notable in this well-cast film (credit Marcia S. Ross) are Sergio Di Zio as the genial Deputy Ted and Greg Dunham as the wordless, menacing Bone. Blending beautifully with them all is Gordon-Levitt, once in TV's "3rd Rock From The Sun," whose quiet, unaffectedly sympathetic performance allows us to meet Chris very much on his own terms.
 
 Working with cinematographer Alar Kivilo ("A Simple Plan," "The Ice Harvest"), writer-director Frank creates a bleak but somehow homespun world for his characters, an effective homage to the kind of small-scale thrillers we never forget. We can't avoid knowing where "The Lookout" is headed, but we are so deep inside its characters' heads that we wouldn't want to go anywhere else.
 
 
 "The Lookout." MPAA rating: R for language, some violence and sexual content. Running time: 1 hour, 39 minutes. In general release.   

Joseph Gordon-Levitt, as a fellow who has suffered serious head trauma, comes up with such a moody Method assemblage of twitches, tics, and guilty Memento  mannerisms that he's not much fun to watch. The Lookout , the first movie directed by screenwriter Scott Frank (Out of Sight ), is a thriller that wheezes along on bits and pieces of ''character.'' The hero gets hoodwinked by a local scuzz (Matthew Goode) into assisting in a bank robbery, which puts us in the unpleasurable position of feeling sorry for a protagonist too out-of-it to grasp what the audience already knows.

 “Ritual. Pattern. Repetition.”  Those words are intoned in voice-over by Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a brain-damaged bank janitor who narrates the screenwriter Scott Frank’s directorial debut, the Midwestern crime drama “The Lookout.” They’re catch phrases learned in therapy, designed to help Chris regain the sense of chronology he lost in a car accident. But they also acknowledge that “The Lookout” is a new version of a very old story: A nobody falls in with scuzzball crooks who make him feel like somebody.  Scuzzball No. 1 is Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode), a former classmate who taps Chris to play lookout in a planned robbery of Chris’s suburban bank in Kansas City, Kan. No. 2 is Bone (Greg Dunham), a longhaired, trench-coated killer who looks like a “Matrix” character played by Sam Shepard. No. 3 is a former stripper who calls herself Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher). Is she more wholesome than her companions, or does it just seem that way because she puts on a frumpy nightgown before seducing Chris?  Mr. Frank’s screenplay for “The Lookout” was long considered one of Hollywood’s great unproduced scripts. The end product doesn’t justify that buildup. Some of the minor characters are thinly drawn (particularly Luvlee, who never manifests the femme fatale qualities her plot function seems to require). And Chris’s last-act conversion from sad-sack patsy to devious score-settler is not persuasive. Still, there’s a lot to like here, and the film’s bleak setting and empathetic tone add interest to what could have been a by-the-numbers affair.  Mr. Frank, who is best known for adapting the Elmore Leonard novel “Out of Sight” for Steven Soderbergh, has a clean, purposeful directing style, particularly in the quick-cut sequences that show Chris shambling through his daily routine. And he displays sincere interest in Chris’s roiling emotions, which are grasped only by his best friend and roommate, the blind ex-criminal Lewis (Jeff Daniels).  With its country music characterizations and its wintry panoramas (by the snow specialist Alar Kivilo, who also shot “A Simple Plan”) “The Lookout” feels less like a modern film noir than a social drama with noir trappings. Several major characters live with mental or physical afflictions (even Gary, who carries the go-to accessory of modern screen goons, an inhaler). The potential haul is pocket change compared to the amounts bandied about in Jerry Bruckheimer epics, and some of the participants seem as though they would back out if they sensed there was another quick way to improve their social station.  Even Chris falls into this category.  The son of a pompous rich man (Bruce McGill),  he is determined to make his own way despite handicaps that he refuses to see as handicaps. He would not have gotten involved with Gary if his condescending boss had allowed him to train as a teller; a rare encouraging statement by that same boss spurs his 11th-hour doubts.  The movie is worth seeing for its cast. Like Lee Marvin in his thug mode, Mr. Goode, with his mix of intelligence, cruelty and self-loathing, is both repugnant and fascinating. Mr. Daniels initially seems to overplay the blind man’s eccentric charisma until you realize that Lewis has fashioned himself into a “character” to mask his feelings of dependence.  Ms. Fisher’s tricky line readings suggest that Luvlee is not the plush waif she appears to be,  particularly in a scene in which Lewis reveals how he lost his sight, and she deadpans, “That is a sad story.  I’m sorry, if it’s true.”  Most impressive of all is Mr. Gordon-Levitt, who is convincing as one of cinema’s most difficult archetypes: the reactive protagonist whose complex emotions are visible to the viewer but invisible to his fellow characters. As he did in “Mysterious Skin,” Mr. Gordon-Levitt conveys damaged decency without special pleading; his average-guy introspection recalls Timothy Bottoms in “The Last Picture Show.” He’s a sweet stoic.  “The Lookout” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for language, some violence and sexual content.

Vet scriptwriter Scott Frank makes a more-than-promising debut as a feature helmer with "The Lookout," a stealthy neo-noir drama that isn't afraid to take its time developing characters on the way to the payoff of a neatly designed caper scenario. Set for a March 30 domestic rollout, pic could conceivably play even better in European markets where auds are traditionally more receptive to such muted, moody fare. Even so, favorable reviews and enthusiastic word of mouth could generate fair-to-good theatrical biz before "The Lookout" looks at a long homevid shelf life.
Given Frank's background adapting Elmore Leonard's "Get Shorty" and "Out of Sight," it's not surprising to discern a distinctly Leonard-esque flavor to his tale of crime and desire. But this is a Leonard-influenced original with the humor tamped down -- way down, actually, but still dark and biting -- and the undercurrents of dread raised very close to flood level.
Chris Pratt (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a Midwestern golden boy with everything going for him -- wealthy parents, a beautiful girlfriend, fame as a high-school hockey star -- when he almost dies in an auto mishap. A few years later, he's still recovering from severe brain damage, often struggling with an unreliable memory and drifting through fogs of disorientation as he attempts the simplest tasks.
Employed as a night janitor at a small-town bank, Chris would like to become a teller. But he so lacks organizational skills that he often forgets where he placed the can opener in the apartment he shares with Lewis (Jeff Daniels), his blind roommate and mentor. Lewis is patient and encouraging, but also snarky and sardonic, and Daniels steals clusters of scenes with his dry delivery of droll wisecracks and comebacks.
When Chris runs into old school acquaintance Gary Spargo (Matthew Goode), he's briefly cheered out of his workaday gloom. And that cheer is greatly enhanced when Gary introduces Chris to Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher), an ex-stripper quite willing to be Chris' private dancer. But the coincidence of Gary's reappearance in Chris' life is more apparent than real. The raspy-voiced "friend" is part of a small gang that's been casing local banks -- including the one where Chris is employed.
As Chris finds himself torn between wanting to remain honest and needing to regain control of his life, he's sorely tempted by the lure of ill-gotten gains. When push comes to shove, however, he has serious second thoughts. But it may be too late to do himself -- or a couple of innocent bystanders -- any good.
Shades of "Memento" arise as Chris labors mightily to remember how to complete actions that he begins, and there are more fleeting echoes of "Fargo" and "The Caveman's Valentine." But Frank works his own sort of storytelling magic with the slightly similar premise, firmly establishing Chris as a complex, guilt-ridden character -- played with compelling persuasiveness by Gordon-Levitt -- before expanding the arresting psychological study to encompass low-key thriller plot mechanics.
Pic is sensationally gripping during an extended latenight sequence in the bank, as Frank ratchets up suspense with familiar tropes and at least one jolting surprise; scripter is quite adept at planting early portents, and the Law of Chekhov's Gun -- i.e., never introduce a firearm unless you intend to use it -- is acknowledged here. One complaint: A major supporting character simply disappears from the action, never to be seen or even referenced again.
Well-cast supporting players, including Bruce McGill as Chris' tough-loving father, Sergio Di Zio as a friendly deputy sheriff and (briefly) Carla Gugino as Chris' case worker, serve the story well.
Pic also boasts evocative lensing by Alar Kivilo (reminiscent of his wintry work in "A Simple Plan" and "The Ice Storm") and an insinuating score by James Newton Howard.

At various times over the last decade, David Fincher , Sam Mendes , and Michael Mann  were attached to direct Scott Frank 's screenplay for The Lookout , about a brain-damaged high school hockey stud who's smooth-talked by distant acquaintances into robbing a small-town bank. That Frankbest known for straightening and sharpening the tangled lines of Elmore Leonard 's novels Get Shorty and Out of Sight wound up directing The Lookout himself was the best thing that could have happened to his script. After all, it's a story about how we tell ourselves stories to retain a tenuous grasp on sanity, and who better to guide us through it than a man obsessed with the process of tale-telling itself?
In truth, The Lookout 's a rather straightforward narrative: A kid is riding high till he's brought low by a horrific accident that leaves him a shell of his former self. He spends years wrestling with pain and guilt, but can make no headway thanks to the fact that his head's in the way; he can remember everything but keep nothing straight, not even his morning routine or where he keeps the can opener. His blind roommate (a bearded and bespectacled Jeff Daniels , looking strangely like The Dude) convinces him to treat his life as a short story, to write everything down in his notepad and to always begin at the end. "Can't tell a story if you don't know where it's going," says the roommate-turned-sage.
Scott Frank, however, begins at the beginning, with Chris Pratt  (Joseph Gordon-Levitt ) soaring at his highest, brightest moment: His wealthy old man (Bruce McGill ) has just bought him a convertible sports car, which Chris drives into the dark, clear night accompanied by the ethereal Southern-rock strains of My Morning Jacket , his stunning blonde girlfriend, and another giggling couple. Chris kills the headlights, to woo and wow his girl with a sky full of fireflies. They laugh, sounding like every other high school jock and homecoming queen who believe themselves immortaltill their giggles are drowned out by the sound of crunched metal and shattered glass.
Years pass, and when next we see Chris he's in therapy, trying to piece together the fragments of his battered brain. He can't recall what he's done that very day. He makes grotesque overtures toward his forgiving caseworker (Carla Gugino , in a brief cameo). He thinks he sees out of the corner of his eye the old girlfriend, who, as far as the audience knows, might have been killed in the accident. He can't find the can opener, which his blind roommate can locate no problemo, bro. He's got a dead-end job sweeping up a small-town bank after hours. In short, he's trappedby his guilt, by his injury, by the old man who gives him just enough dough to pay rent, by a bright future that turned into a shit present.
Which is why Chris, the least likely candidate for a bank heist, bites when a guy from high school named Gary (Matthew Goode ) baits the hook. "Whoever has the money has the power," Gary tells him. "Don't you want your old life back?" Gary dangles extra incentive: Luvlee Lemons (Isla Fisher ), a former stripper who, like Gary, was ahead of Chris in school but nonetheless in awe of him way back when. All they ask of Chris is that on the night of the heist, he act ashere it comesthe lookout.
There are moments when The Lookout feels like an early screenplay from a veteran writer; it has a few plot holes (involving a security system and a character who simply vanishes with no explanation), but when considered as a whole, when appreciated and absorbed from hypnotic start to thrilling finish, The Lookout works. It takes its time, saves its breath, lets us know these people before putting guns in their hands and tossing them in a tiny bank vault on a winter's night. Frank likes his story, but he loves his characters.
Gordon-Levitt, who was only beginning his stint on Third Rock From the Sun   when Frank first wrote the script, was last seen on-screen swishing around in his mouth the tangy gumshoe slang of Rian Johnson 's solid Brick . The Lookout is sort of Brick 's flipsidenoir filled with silences, a movie in which the hero's always this close to playing the patsy. As Chris, Gordon-Levitt has to play a kid who can't find the words to say what he means; the movie hints that for a long time, he couldn't even talk. Gordon-Levitt's worth the admission all by his lonesome. He's that goodthe proverbial young man with an old soul who brings unexpected depth, complexity, and sincerity to what could have been just another damaged-guy role. He's the one to look out for.
