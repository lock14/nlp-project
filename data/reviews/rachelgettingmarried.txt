By now, we've all seen enough swervy, bobbingcamera film fictions to have grown more or less immune to the technique. So when I tell you that Jonathan Demme's Rachel Getting Married  is a family drama shot in spontaneous long takes in the brash, jumpy handheld mode of a home video, you'd be right to say, ''What else is new?'' But Rachel Getting Married  is something new indeed. It's not just the images (shot by Declan Quinn) that are off-balance and intimately charged. So is everything that happens to the Buchmans, a Connecticut family who live on a leafy estate, where they're about to marry their eldest daughter, Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt), to Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe), who is some sort of music-biz hotshot. He is also African-American, a fact the film exquisitely ignores (though that doesn't mean it isn't central to the dramatic texture).
Rachel's sister, Kym (Anne Hathaway), has been an addict since she was in her teens. (Which drugs? All of them.) For the occasion, she is being let out of rehab for the weekend. The last actress you'd expect to see cast as a self-loathing, frayed-nerves drug casualty is a red-carpet blossom like Hathaway. Yet from the moment she shows up, her eyes peering with a junkie's paranoid radar from beneath her Louise Brooks-helmet-slashed-with-a-straight-razor hair, the actress wires you right into her rage and awareness. Kym is a walking disaster, but a disaster with feelers, and the effect she has upon her family is to electrify them with the dreaded truths she calls up. Hathaway is a revelation: She makes toxic narcissism mesmerizing, but she also gives Kym a desperate confessional ardor.
I don't think I've ever seen a wedding film that made me feel the way this one does, as if I wasn't just crashing the event but was part of the family. In a rehearsal dinner that sprawls on, the speeches are so revealing, stirring up so many awkward, touching crosscurrents, that it's as if you've known everyone in the room for years. That level of realism, as Robert Altman understood well, turns the most microscopic of interactions into drama, and that's the level Demme is working on here. It helps that the script, by Jenny Lumet (Sidney's daughter), is a fully woven web of love, jealousy, and enabling demons. After a while, Debra Winger shows up as the sisters' quasi-estranged mother, and she and Hathaway have a fight scene that's as raw as Ingmar Bergman and as operatic as Mildred Pierce .
This melting-pot wedding creates a frisson of its own; it's a vision of a new world. I do wish that Demme hadn't let the wedding music, by Robyn Hitchcock, Sister Carol East, and a few others, take over the last act. This much healing-by-'80s-hipster-taste is too  much. But Rachel Getting Married  is still a triumph  Demme's finest work since The Silence of the Lambs , and a movie that tingles with life.

 The problem in “Rachel Getting Married” — not the problem with the film, mind you — is that even though Rachel is the one getting married, it’s all about Kym, her younger sister. Kym, played by a decidedly un-princessy Anne Hathaway, is furloughed from rehab for the happy event, arriving at her father’s rambling Connecticut clapboard house on a toxic cloud of snark, cigarette smoke and wounded narcissism. With her pale, slack features and dark-rimmed eyes framed by severe bangs, Ms. Hathaway resembles the silent film star Louise Brooks in “Pandora’s Box,” except that Kym is less like the curious maiden of Greek mythology than like the box itself:  a bottomless repository of guilt, destructiveness and general bad feeling.  And yet she is also an undeniably magnetic figure, drawing the attention of her father (Bill Irwin) away from Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt) and pulling both the film’s and her family’s center of gravity toward the self-loathing, self-pitying core of her damaged personality. And like the family the film, directed by Jonathan Demme from a screenplay by Jenny Lumet, both accommodates Kym’s need for recognition and struggles against it.  The themes of dependency and recovery that Kym brings home in her overnight bag are familiar, even banal. Every unhappy family may be unique, but every addict is fundamentally the same, and if “Rachel Getting Married” had surrendered its story completely to Kym, it would have risked becoming as drab and familiar as a made-for-television 12-step homily.  But Mr. Demme protects the film against such an unsatisfying fate. He is certainly sympathetic to Kym, even as he and Ms. Hathaway conspire to show her at her appalling worst. But he has never been one to restrict his sympathies, and the wonderful thing about “Rachel Getting Married” is how expansive it seems, in spite of the limits of its scope and the modesty of its ambitions. It’s a small movie, and in some ways a very sad one, but it has an undeniable and authentic vitality, an exuberance of spirit, that feels welcome and rare.  Neither the conceit nor the approach are all that unusual. In press materials Mr. Demme cites “A Wedding,” Robert Altman’s marvelously anarchic 1978 pageant of bourgeois dysfunction, as an inspiration. He also shows a clear debt to the ostentatiously austere methods of the fading Dogma 95 movement. The audience only hears music that the people in the movie hear as well, and the proceedings are recorded by a busily wandering video camera, giving “Rachel Getting Married” some of the rough, hectic intimacy of “The Celebration,” Thomas Vinterberg’s Dogma tour de force about a family party knocked off kilter by secrets and recriminations.  Mr. Demme is neither as sadistic as Mr. Vinterberg nor as satirical as Mr. Altman. This is, after all, the man who directed “The Silence of the Lambs,” surely the most humane serial-killer movie in the annals of the genre, as well as the infinitely tolerant “Philadelphia.” (His more recent work consists of earnest documentaries like “Jimmy Carter Man From Plains” and “The Agronomist” and underrated updates of 1960s thrillers — “The Manchurian Candidate” and “The Truth About Charlie.”) He is the kind of filmmaker who gives Hollywood liberalism a good name, and the most striking aspect of “Rachel Getting Married” is how, without overt ideological posturing, it paints a faithful and affectionate (though hardly uncritical) portrait of blue-state America.  And this is where the movie turns out to be, after all, about Rachel, a lovely and complicated young woman whose adoring fiancé, Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe), is black. Rachel and Kym’s stepmother, Carol (Anna Deavere Smith), is also African-American, as far as we can tell. These facts are never mentioned by anyone in the movie, which gathers races, traditions and generations in a pleasing display of genteel multiculturalism. It’s a big, messy gathering even without Kym’s melodrama, so there may be no time for expressions of prejudice or social unease.  It might seem that this tableau is a kind of Utopian wish fulfillment, the naïve projection of a longed-for harmony that does not yet exist. To some extent this may be true, but the texture of “Rachel Getting Married” is so loose and lived in, its faces (many of them belonging to nonprofessional actors) so interesting and real, that it looks more plausibly like a mirror of the way things are. It is not that racial division is willed away or made to disappear, but rather that, on this particular weekend, other matters are more important. A wedding, after all, represents a symbolic as well as an actual union, an intimation of possible perfection in a decidedly imperfect world.  And so it may be up to Kym, cynical and solipsistic, to save the movie from sentimentality, just as Rachel, embodied with  calm intelligence by Ms. DeWitt, inoculates it against melodrama. Debra Winger, in a few quietly incandescent scenes as their mother, briefly lifts the movie onto another plane altogether, somehow combining movie-star charisma with an almost heartbreaking restraint and giving us a taste of what we’ve been missing in the years of her semi-retirement.  In any case, it would be a shame to miss “Rachel Getting Married,” which may have its flaws, but which is so persuasively forgiving of the flaws of its inhabitants that you can only respond, in like spirit, with love.  “Rachel Getting Married” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, drug use and emotional violence.

Brimming with energy, elan and the unpredictability of his "Something Wild," Jonathan Demme's triumphant "Rachel Getting Married" may just lay the wedding film to rest, being such a hard act to follow. Amid preparations for a biracial wedding, in comes the bride's time-bomb of a sister (Anne Hathaway), fresh from a nine-month stay at her umpteenth rehab, ready to open every can of worms in the cupboard. Riding emotional rollercoasters to the ever-changing rhythms of the wonderfully eclectic in-house bands whose music never ceases, Demme's self-styled stunner should appeal to arthouse auds upon its Oct. 3 release by Sony Classics.
Kym (Hathaway, fragile, angry and superb) does not qualify as a likely candidate for Miss Congeniality. Commanding centerstage, she's not about to let a little thing like her sister's wedding take away from the spectacle of her suffering. A succinct, wryly perfect AA meeting makes clear that Kym's guilt over the death of her little brother, Ethan, has left her incapable of coping with herself, just as others have difficulty coping with her. The entire family carries the scars of Ethan's death, along with all manner of festering hurts and enduring longings.
Rachel (Rosemarie DeWitt) resents her sister's constant emotional drain on their rich, white, liberal New England family, leaving precious few resources for her own needs. In a marvelously funny scene, when Rachel suddenly announces she is pregnant during a bout of mutual sisterly recriminations, Kym inanely cries foul, unable to overcome her anger at being upstaged.
A whole sea of troubles roils beneath the siblings' superficially polite relationship with their divorced and remarried mother (an incomparable Debra Winger), the tensions more inchoately acted out than specifically spelled out. Meanwhile, their dad (Demme regular Bill Irwin), expansive and all-embracing, cannot leave anything alone, anxiously pushing food and solicitude upon his welcoming guests and his far less receptive daughters.
Doubtless, the black groom and his family could yield similar soap operatics, but the film never ventures far into the other side of the aisle, except for innumerable toasts, hugs and songs as musician/groom Sidney (Tunde Adebimpe) launches into a cappella Neil Young after the vows.
The characters' volatile moodswings are matched by the restlessness of the HD camerawork commandeered by Declan Quinn ("Monsoon Wedding"). Quinn's camera, few of whose moves were blocked out beforehand, proves ever ready to take off in unexpected directions.
With the passing of Robert Altman, Demme remains the only one of his groundbreaking generation of '60s/'70s-spawned, open-ended moviemakers consistently making films. Though written by Jenny Lumet (Sidney's daughter) and owing more, plot-wise, to Noah Baumbach's "Margot at the Wedding" than to Altman's "A Wedding," "Rachel Getting Married" quite consciously inscribes itself with that Altmanesque tradition of go-with-the-flow, quasi-ethnographic American walkabouts.
The family of the bride here recalls the Kennedy-like dysfunctional clan in "Five Easy Pieces," and like Bob Rafelson, Demme never tells auds what to think about his characters. And if the many disparate people in the frame do not deliver precisely syncopated, overlapping dialogue, they are dazzlingly counterpointed musically, as Mendelssohn-strumming electric guitarists, scantily costumed dancers or Arabic flautists march to the beats of different drums with overarching harmony.
Tech credits are top-notch.

Those who believe that Jonathan Demme  went all soft with Philadelphia  and never recovered may not be reassured by his latest movie, an ensemble tale of family pathology gussied up with vérité camera work, world music, and improvising actors both trained and not. You can find the worst and the best of Demme in Rachel Getting Married , which may be an avowed fan's fond farewell to Robert Altman , but it's still a middlebrow domestic drama beating its wings against an experimental frame.
For all the familiar terrain it plows—dysfunctional clan comes unglued, regroups—the movie is not without its sly rewards, one of which is Anne Hathaway  in chopped hair and pleading eyes as the bad seed who threatens to wreck a perfectly good hippie nuptial. For someone who's mostly been stuck playing glowing good girls, Hathaway's feverish portrayal of Kym, a junkie venturing out of rehab for the weekend to attend her upright sister's wedding, shows a gift for brittle passive-aggression blended with a fragile desperation that cuts right through any uncharitable thoughts you might harbor about another pretty actress angling for an Oscar. No wilting crackhead, Kym is a grade-A emotional terrorist who imagines that no matter what's going on, it's all about her: from manipulating her sister Rachel (Mad Men  's Rosemarie DeWitt ) into dumping her own best friend as maid of honor, to using a prenuptial dinner toast for a self-pitying public bath in her own travails. Hathaway's adroit grandstanding puts up an impressive fight against a TV-movie plot that features the kind of secret only lazy screenwriters use to get an audience's tears flowing, a baffling subtextual plea for interracial love and understanding, and a climax full of gaga goodwill.
How much of Kym's bracingly whiny dialogue was actually written by screenwriter Jenny Lumet  (daughter of Sidney) is unclear, for Demme seems bent on ceding directorial control wherever possible. He's stacked the cast with his friends, neighbors, and a sprinkling of New Orleans's dispossessed, not to mention the international musicians endlessly tuning up in every nook and cranny of the house, tracked by Declan Quinn 's jittery handheld camera. (When Hathaway, in an irritable and apparently unscripted moment, asks for them to shut up already, I stifled a cheer.) Like any good host, Demme gave some of his wedding guests their own little cameras, and while it's fun to glimpse his mentor Roger Corman  wielding one, I'm not convinced that all this aesthetic democracy is required to support such a simple tale. Yet it's Demme's loosey-goosey method that ends up breathing any ragged life into the movie's saintly march toward a happy ending.
Demme seems to be a kind and hopeful man who wants to make people feel good, so it's hard to begrudge him the colorful saris, world music, interracial harmony, and all. Certainly, I enjoyed Rachel Getting Married  a whole lot better than its evil twin, Noah Baumbach 's grungy, mean-spirited, relentlessly cold Margot at the Wedding . And at his best, Demme instinctively grasps the runaway anarchy of human relations, in this case the way hurt and loss ricochet around a troubled family like poisoned arrows for years. Even with all the distracting flimflam buzzing around them, there's still a searing intensity to the battling duo at the movie's core, two imperfectly mothered sisters going at it like bantam roosters when they should be closing ranks. To watch Rachel and Kym hammer away at one another, retreat, return to jockeying for the attention of their separated parents, and finally try to connect is to witness both the terrible loneliness of being surrounded by family with no one on your side—and the brave, admirable folly of hope triumphing over experience.
