We may not see it often, but Gillian Anderson has a wonderful face for movies. It's long, with big features that don't give a lot away. She would have been a huge star in the 1930s and '40s, when the good screenplays had snap and a half-awake director would have made the most of her smolder and intelligence. Instead, her career has been bound up, in one way or another, with Dana Scully, the FBI agent whom Anderson has been playing on "The X-Files" since the early 1990s.
Anderson gave a devastatingly seductive performance eight years ago as Lily Bart in "The House of Mirth," and it promised a long, bright life after the show. Oh well. Now she's back again as Scully, a mystery that seems beyond even her sleuthing. "The X-Files: I Want to Believe," a second film based on the show, requires her to say things like "A young agent's life is at stake," "It's over," and "I'm taking a chance on a radical and extremely painful medical procedure." Dana, so is the audience.
The movie reunites Anderson and David Duchovny, who seems a little happier to be playing Fox Mulder again. He gets to fight off attack dogs, get shot with a tranquilizer, and watch people fall down elevator shafts. Duchovny's seemingly sleep-deprived humor makes sense as Mulder, a kook vaguely embarrassed by his kookiness. But you have to wonder whether he and Anderson will be consigned to live on as the Shatner-Nimoy of their generation.
The show's creator, Chris Carter, directed and co-wrote "I Want to Believe," but this time doesn't have the duo do anything other worldly. They're not chasing aliens, just leads on a missing FBI agent. Scully has quit the bureau to practice medicine full time. Mulder appears to have quit to practice growing the Unabomber's beard. But the FBI - represented by Amanda Peet and rapper/ride-pimper Xzibit, naturally - needs them. The agency has been relying on the hunches of a clairvoyant pedophile priest, played by an under-the-top Billy Connolly, to catch a predator. The priest might be connected to the victim. He may have known her captors. He might want to see someone about his bleeding eyes.
Regardless, if that's all I had to go on, Mulder and Scully's believer-skeptic routine might start looking pretty good to me, too.
Carter and co-writer Frank Spotnitz have stapled together an arbitrary plot out of yesterday's news (cancer, Russians, gay marriage, stem cells, clergy sex abuse) in a way that drags us back to the lousy thrillers of both the 1980s and last spring. I thought April's "88 Minutes," with its steaming pile of Pacino, would be the last time a movie would cook up a homosexual nutjob. Oops. "I Want to Believe" comes up with two.
The movie is less like an episode of "The X-Files" and more like the trashiest installment ever of "Law & Order: SVU." Benson and Stabler have seen some loony stuff but nothing this sick. And certainly Benson has never brought the house down, as Scully does, by surveying a crime scene and saying, "I've got work to do here." Even the putdown of our current president is out of line. George W. Bush may be responsible for a lot of messes, but this movie's not one of them.
The whole thing feels like atonement for the pretensions and preposterous dead ends of the last "X-Files" movie and the show's diminished final seasons. "I Want to Believe" isn't so much for the fans, who will always have reruns, or the actors, who will always have residuals, but for Carter himself, who like George Lucas seems unduly obsessed with his signature franchise well past its actual value.
The truth is, indeed, still out there. And when Carter finds it, may he heed its wisdom: Let go.

Even a casual fan of TV's The X-Files  knows in advance what beliefs are at stake in The X-Files: I Want to Believe . Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) wants to believe in the reality of paranormal phenomena; Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) wants to put her faith in God and science working in harmony. Both are challenged by evidence. It was ever thus  and that constancy, along with the familiar frisson of romantic tension between the still wry Mulder and the still mournfully radiant Scully are what anchor this melancholy, depressive, time-warped feature re-opening of old files. Director and series creator Chris Carter adds a defrocked priest (Billy Connolly) who prays that if he uses his psychic abilities for good, God can forgive him his sins as a convicted pedophile. Should Scully, Mulder, and a harder-edged FBI (represented by Amanda Peet) believe the repentant sinner's claim to ''see'' missing persons?
The movie arrives like a cosmic relic from the distant 1990s, when hope wasn't quite so battered. Older and sadder, Mulder and Scully are no longer sure they've got the energy to even ask if the truth is still out there. And it feels as if Carter is skeptical, too.

 I wanted to believe. But with his big-screen blowup of his great and weird television series “The X-Files,” Chris Carter has turned me into a reluctant skeptic. Baggy, draggy, oddly timed and strangely off the mark, “The X-Files: I Want to Believe” is the generally bad-news follow-up to the show’s first feature-film incarnation, “The X-Files.” Released in 1998 and directed by Rob Bowman, one of the show’s regular frontmen, that earlier film was a seamless translation of the series’s paranoid vibe and trademark geek cool. The series supersized nicely, filling the larger spatial dimensions by staying true to its conceptual parameters.  Not that it isn’t swell to see Mulder and Scully, the Nick and Nora of paranormal freakouts  —  a k a David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson —  once again trading dark, searching looks under the cover of the long night, or even by bright eerie day. Mulder may be wearing a bushy beard (Mr. Carter builds up the character’s entrance so dramatically I expected something rather more leprous), and Scully looks thinner, more angled, a touch weary. But it’s still them, the sexy renegade agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation who, for almost a decade, poked into strange goings-on, partly driven by Mulder’s belief that his sister had been kidnapped by extraterrestrials and partly by a work relationship that became something more.  That relationship still simmers, though at a reduced temperature. There’s nothing stirring the air between Mulder and Scully, who, having left the bureau, come across as unmoored and unfocused, even when they’re working on the outlandish criminal case that drags them back into the twilight zone. A similar lack of urgency characterizes the movie, which despite its yowling dogs, barking Russians, screaming women, swelling choral voices and moody cinematography by Bill Roe — which turns even dark blue a deeper shade of black —  never finds a sustainable pulse. Mr. Carter knows how to grab your attention visually, but the amalgam of trashy thriller clichés that he has compiled with Frank Spotnitz, another series regular, creates its own deadening effect. It’s no wonder Mulder and Scully seem so diffident.  The first “X-Files” movie, released before the show ended, added nothing substantive. It came off like a contract clause writ large, a shot at a potential franchise. The new film, Mr. Carter’s debut as a feature director, adds even less, but it won’t hurt the show’s legacy, at least among die-hard fans who appreciated it as a wittily sustained pop take on what the historian Richard Hofstadter has called “the paranoid style in American politics.” In the years since the show’s demise, American politics has grown all the more paranoid, an observation that Mr. Carter — who throws out an easy laugh about President Bush to no real purpose — might have run with instead of stumbling in less interesting directions.  “The X-Files: I Want to Believe” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Heads roll.

If the first "X-Files" movie landed in the midst of the TV show's run and near the height of its popularity, the second -- far more modest in scope and ambition -- comes six years after the program signed off. Both, however, share a common trait: Namely, neither would qualify as a better-than-average episode of the series. Director/franchise creator Chris Carter gives devoted fans plenty of small moments to swoon over, but the appeal should be limited beyond those fervent loyalists. So while the opening should be reasonably robust, this remains a movie primarily reserved for those wanting to believe in it.
A few niggling details -- including Carter's lawsuit against 20th Century Fox -- had to be resolved before the movie could happen. Nevertheless, the passage of time did wonders for "Sex and the City," and pent-up demand will doubtless prompt initial whoops and hollers here. Because the series' arcane alien-invasion mythology became increasingly impenetrable in the latter stages, there's also something to be said for returning to basics.
The execution, though, is another matter. Released amid the kind of security normally reserved for nuclear launch codes (and no spoilers here), the plot is initiated largely by a baffling missing-persons case that results in former FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) being summoned from professional exile.
Mulder, of course, was once assigned to investigate unexplained cases, paired with skeptical partner/medical doctor Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Pressed back into service, they interact mostly with two existing agents (Amanda Peet and rapper Alvin "Xzibit" Joiner) and a fallen priest (Billy Connolly), who may be experiencing psychic visions.
Moving rapidly into the main story, Carter (who also wrote and produced with longtime collaborator Frank Spotnitz) still grasps the inherent spookiness of things that go bump in the night -- or, in this particular setting, in vast, white fields of snow, where much of the action transpires. The problem is that the mystery isn't as compelling or satisfying as it should be, and a "B" arc involving Scully separates the central duo at times without adding much to the narrative. Indeed, when Peet's character offhandedly references some of Mulder's past adventures, it's hard not to wish you were watching one of them.
First glimpsed with a slightly rabbinical beard, Duchovny hasn't lost his facility for delivering wisecracks, and Anderson can rattle off medical gibberish with the best of them. As for their chemistry, history has exacted something of a toll, not that it will matter much to those who once sighed breathlessly whenever the two so much as brushed fingertips.
Never ones to miss an opportunity, the brass at Fox were savvy to push for the movie now -- and in a package that minimizes financial risk by eschewing pyrotechnics to focus on the show's creepy essence. (As always, composer Mark Snow's score goes a long way toward making a walk to the mailbox seem fraught with peril.)
Still, the warming glow of nostalgia only goes so far, with one's level of forgiveness likely dictated by where they reside along the "X-Files" fan continuum -- ranging from those who can rattle off the Cigarette-Smoking Man's personal data to casual viewers of a few episodes. At either end of the spectrum, though, in searching for a great "X-Files" movie, that truth remains out there.
