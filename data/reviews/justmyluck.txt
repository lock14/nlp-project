Just My Luck
 is the first film in which Lohan portrays a full-fledged adult. As Ashley Albright, she has a fantastically vague professional job, an enormously unrealistic New York apartment, and gorgeously dazed admirers. Enter Jake (Pine): fumbling, stumbling, can�t catch a break, but really good looking behind his dazed expression, Jake. While Ashley�s career and love life sail beyond the stratosphere, everything Jake touches explodes (literally). He poorly manages a British boy band (played by British pop sensation McFly) and begs them for more time. At a gaudy masquerade ball, Jake and Ashley cross paths, kiss and exchange lucks (don�t ask). Jake�s world is immediately turned inside out. The band gets a huge record deal. Jake suddenly has women throwing themselves at him and a fully furnished loft with a laundry room larger than most New York apartments. Meanwhile, our poor heroine goes to jail, losing her job and all of her possessions. Tracking down a thickly accented fortuneteller, she discovers her fate but cannot remember who it was she kissed at the party (isn�t that always the case!). Finally, she re-encounters our hero. Jake takes pity on Ashley, finds her a job, and makes eyes at her while imparting wisdom about life with no luck. In an astounding third-act twist, Ashley learns that it was Jake (no!) she kissed at the party and decides to take back her luck. But wait. Jake needs his good luck. His band is having their premiere concert and everything�s going wrong! What�s a lucky girl to do? I won�t ruin it for you, but ultimately, Ashley does learn that if your boyfriend needs you to save his boy band, then dang it, you better be there. Just My Luck
 operates under the laziness of too many romantic comedies today. With an entirely preposterous premise, rules can be rewritten or ignored depending on the requirements of the plot. While Freaky Friday
, one of Lohan�s breakout films in the fantastical screwball comedy genre, produced entertaining results, Just My Luck
 does not measure up. There is a smile or two to be had in simply watching Lohan fall down so much, and Love is mildly entertaining as a vain record executive. But Just My Luck
 offers up few laughs and even fewer surprises. No doubt this film will please the pre-teen set, but they�d be so much better off staying home and renting Mean Girls
.

         In the long run, Lindsay Lohan will do just fine. Really, the girl's got skills. "Freaky Friday"? She rocks, right? "Mean Girls"? What a hoot!
 
 And you don't get asked to host "Saturday Night Live" more than once if you don't know how to read and react to funny stuff. That is, if she's given funny stuff to read and react to — which, sad to say, didn't happen much on that most recent "SNL" she hosted. So if you want to see what star potential looks like, rent the two movies cited above and stay as far away from "Just My Luck" as you can.
 


         






   Too bad Lohan couldn't run away from it in time. All this so she could play someone who's not a teenager? And this is what playing "grown-up" will be like for her? Hoo-boy!
 
 Karma. That's what it is. And that's what this so-called comedy is supposed to be about. Lohan is cast as the prosaically named Ashley Albright, a fast-tracking junior executive with a snazzy public relations firm. As one of her friends puts it, the lucky stick hit Ashley hard from birth. Bad juju never lands on her dappled shoulders. Her polar opposite is Jake Hardin (Chris Pine), a sweet-natured klutz for whom every trapdoor and open manhole has a "drop in" sign just for him.
 
 They're both so ridiculously conceived that they just have to meet at a masquerade ball and kiss so hard that their fortunes do an immediate switcheroo. Jake suddenly finds himself a protégé of pop mogul Damon Phillips (Faizon Love deserves better too), while Ashley loses her job, her apartment, her wardrobe, her self-esteem.
 
 The situation is supposed to allow Lohan to show what she can do as a physical comedian. But her every faux pas comes across as rank humiliation, and it can only be entertaining for sadistic mall rats who get their jollies seeing Miss Budding Superstar wallow in grime and slip on soap. The pedestrian pacing and the lummox-like staging don't help her or anyone else in her immediate vicinity.
 
 One hears that Lohan is about to leave behind such flighty fare for heavier lifting and better vehicles; much better, in any case, than "Just My Luck." For her sake — and ours — that better be more than just a rumor.

 With "Just My Luck," Lindsay Lohan, a few months shy of her 20th birthday, graduates from kiddie movies to the marginally more grown-up genre of Manhattan career-girl romantic comedy, following in the footsteps of Kate Hudson, Sarah Jessica Parker and, if you want to go way back, Doris Day.  The film, directed by Donald Petrie ("Mystic Pizza," "Miss Congeniality," "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days") obliquely acknowledges this lineage. At one point, an orange Dolce & Gabbana dress said to belong to Ms. Parker is mistakenly delivered to Ms. Lohan's character, who blithely wears it on a date with a rich, studly suitor.  But this is not "Sex and the City," even though one of the credited screenwriters, Amy B. Harris, used to work on that show; it's not even "Failure to Launch." (Ms. Parker never shows up to claim that dress, by the way.) "Just My Luck" is a bit of lukewarm cappuccino froth confected to float Ms. Lohan to the next stage of her career.  She remains an appealing screen presence, with an ability to undercut her own cuteness with quick timing and a Doris Day-like knack for mugging in character. The movie itself is innocuous and flat-footed, taking the safest possible route through its semi-ingenious supernatural conceit.  The idea is that Ashley (Ms. Lohan) is blessed with extraordinary good fortune, which means she can always find a cab, is never caught in traffic or bad weather, and coasts upward at her job at a public relations firm.  Meanwhile, her opposite number and eventual heartthrob, Jake (Chris Pine), finds himself stuck in an endless run of bad luck. We first meet Jake, who manages a British pop band (the actual British pop band McFly) in between humiliations, as he tries to deliver a demo CD to a record company mogul (Faizon Love). His pants fall down, he executes several flailing pratfalls, and he is rewarded for his troubles with a trip to jail.  Eventually, he and Ashley meet cute at a costume party, where they kiss, swapping luck along with spit. Now her life unravels in a series of mishaps, while for him everything starts going right. McFly scores a record deal! Then there is a second kiss, and a few more, and the movie is over, just as you knew it would be.  Along the way, there are the usual romantic comedy decorations: a pair of mildly eccentric, inexplicably single friends (Samaire Armstrong and Bree Turner) for Ashley, as well as a snooty boss (Missi Pyle); Jake has an adorable young cousin (Makenzie Vega) who lives down the hall. The only thing missing is an actual joke or a situation that is in any way charming or surprising.  "Just My Luck" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some naughty words and a few mildly risqué situations and innuendoes.

As disposable as a broken mirror, "Just My Luck" plays like a focus-group compilation of everything a 12-year-old girl could want in a Lindsay Lohan movie -- boy-band soundtrack and super-chic wardrobe, plus a leading lady who, against considerable odds, emerges with her charm and dignity mostly intact. Slick bubble-gum fantasy about the supernatural transfer of luck between two romantic hopefuls couldn't be more effectively tweener-targeted, ensuring steady adolescent biz and possibly even luckier numbers on homevid.
Helmer Donald Petrie ("Miss Congeniality," "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days") seems at times to be making the modern-day equivalent of a Doris Day comedy, setting the pic in a lacquered fantasy New York, piling on cutesy-coy dialogue and mining a fluffy premise for all manner of far-fetched cleverness.
Though it's never quite clear how old her character is supposed to be, 19-year-old Lohan is well cast as the preternaturally lucky Ashley Albright, who can hardly cross the street or scratch a lottery ticket without reaping major benefits. Her accursed opposite is an accident-prone young man named Jake (Chris Pine, unconvincing as a bespectacled dweeb), who supplements his dead-end job trying to manage a band (real-life Brit boy group McFly, for whom "Just My Luck" serves as an exceedingly blatant piece of advertising).
The two first cross paths at a lavish masquerade ball thrown in honor of Damon Phillips (Faizon Love), a record industry bigwig being courted by the PR firm where Ashley works. In a characteristically contrived setup, Jake, trying to hustle Phillips into listening to a sample CD, ends up taking to the dance floor with Ashley.
The random kiss that follows -- much like the magical fortune cookies in the superior Lohan vehicle "Freaky Friday" -- triggers an abrupt role shift, with Jake shedding his geeky veneer and making major career progress while Ashley's life spirals haplessly out of control.
Before long, Ashley finds herself homeless, jobless and slathered in large quantities of mud and paint, as Lohan, once the picture of pert sophistication, is repeatedly put through the physical wringer. Thesp has a gift for knockabout comedy that results in some deftly choreographed slapstick, plus a few sequences -- one of them involving a malfunctioning washing machine -- that seem to be straining rather desperately for "I Love Lucy" territory.
Petrie maintains a machine-polished comic rhythm that's well-suited to the relentless artificiality of I. Marlene King and Amy B. Harris' script. As their characters begin to circle each other romantically, unaware they have each inherited the other's luck (or lack thereof), Lohan and Pine display an easy, winsome chemistry. Yet even their heartfelt moments feel overly shellacked by Teddy Castellucci's sugary score, as does the story's weirdly irrelevant just-say-no-to-superstitions message.
Missi Pyle is nastily one-note as Ashley's reptilian boss, while Tovah Feldshuh is wasted as a tarot-card reader who foresees the change in Ashley's fortunes. Samaire Armstrong ("The OC") makes a strong impression as Ashley's spirited but sensible friend.
Pic's equation of luck with material success is matched visually by its love of shiny surfaces, as expressed in Ray Kluga's Gotham-lux production design and Gary Jones' runway-ready costumes. Lohan, for the record, wears an inordinate amount of eye shadow for reasons that appear unconnected with the script.
