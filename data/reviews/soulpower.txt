It's been all but forgotten that the 1974 Muhammad Ali–George Foreman bout in Zaire  the event captured so memorably in When We Were Kings  (1996)  was the occasion for a three-day soul-music blowout. The entire event was filmed, and this concert movie offers highlights of it for the very first time. It's great to see James Brown in his funk- peacock prime (and the Spinners in their mellow glory), though the general spirit of the festival is more potent than most of the performances. What's infectious in Soul Power  is the almost shocking optimism of its America-meets- Africa '70s world-beat vibe.


 A partial list, in alphabetical order, of the reasons to see “Soul Power” might go as follows: James Brown, Celia Cruz and the Fania All-Stars, B. B. King, Miriam Makeba, the Spinners and Bill Withers. A partial list, as I say, of performers captured with remarkable sonic brilliance and visual immediacy on an outdoor stage in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Congo),  in 1974.  If you have any knowledge of these musicians, you will by now have stopped reading and gone off to order tickets to this extravagantly entertaining documentary, assembled by Jeffrey Levy-Hinte from a trove of hundreds of hours of footage captured by some of the world’s finest cinéma vérité camera operators some 35 years ago.  The number of people who say they were at Woodstock has long since grown beyond any plausible estimate of attendance, and the release of “Soul Power” may lead to a rash of unlikely, passionate claims to have been in Zaire when this monumental and now half-forgotten concert went down. It’s not too late. And if for some reason you think of James Brown and Bill Withers  as dusty names in the annals of popular music, this movie will help you complete your education.  But beyond — or rather by way of — the sheer pleasure it affords, “Soul Power” offers a vivid glimpse of a fascinating moment in musical history, racial politics and global pop culture. The Zaire ’74 festival was originally conceived as a companion to the heavyweight championship fight between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman. Just before the concert was scheduled to begin, and too late for postponement, Mr. Foreman injured his eye. The bout was pushed back six weeks, but the show went on.  Both events were recorded on film, though it took a long time for the images to see the light of day. “When We Were Kings,” Leon Gast’s unforgettable account of the Ali-Foreman fight, was released in 1996 and included only glancing mention of the concert. Mr. Levy-Hinte’s film complements Mr. Gast’s, though its approach is a little different. There are no ex post facto talking-head interviews with witnesses and interpreters (though George Plimpton does show up drunk at a party). Instead the music and the musicians speak for themselves.  Not only them of course. Mr. Ali is there, vain, shrewd and witty as ever, cooling his heels and running his mouth, expounding on the legacies of colonialism and slavery and presenting himself, hyperbolically and in sly earnest, as a global ambassador of freedom and justice. The promoter Don King is also on hand, spinning rhetorical webs that link his own commercial interests with the causes of liberation and self-determination. He sometimes has a point, though Brown makes it more succinctly and with a bit more credibility when he observes that “you can’t get liberated broke.”  Financed by a group of Liberian investors and authorized by the Zairean dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, a corrupt and brutal strongman with a touch of theatrical flair and unusual fashion sense, Zaire ’74 may not stand up very well as the expression of a political cause. But the preparations, in New York and in Kinshasa, illuminate the complexities and contradictions of organizing a modern media spectacle in a third-world country, and suggest that some of the perks and stresses of show business are pretty much the same wherever you go.  And the music itself tells a deeper and more exalted story. Various strands of African, African-American and Caribbean musical expression collide and commingle, providing enough research material for a course in ethnomusicology. The beats of Ms. Cruz and her salseros bounce off the rhythms of Zairean dancers, while the sounds of Memphis and Philadelphia both echo and feed the songs of Mali and South Africa.  Manu Dibango walks the streets of Kinshasa, performing a call and response with a group of children. Other children are shown doing marching exercises, which look like versions of the crisply choreographed stages moves executed by the Spinners. At the end Brown, a musical cosmos unto himself, sums it all up and breaks it all down.  A tremendous amount of work clearly went into the Zaire ’74 festival and into winnowing its bounty into a feature film. (I’m hoping for a DVD boxed set that lets the viewer live through the whole three-day lollapalooza in real time.) And the intense labor of the performers is also in evidence. You understand the effort and practice involved in making something that seems so spontaneous, natural and free. “Soul Power,” as aptly and succinctly titled a movie as I have ever seen, takes you to a place where the discipline that produces great popular art is indistinguishable from the ecstasy that art creates.  “Soul Power” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some swearing and sexual references.

Another legendary 1970s-era concert sees the light of day through the miracle of technology in the joyously funky docu "Soul Power." The untold story of the three-day lineup of soul and world talent that preceded 1974's Muhammad Ali-George Foreman "Rumble in the Jungle" fight in Zaire and toplined James Brown, pic is an instant DVD classic, with prior theatrical and tube action in the cards a la 2003 rediscovery "Festival Express."
Editor-producer-helmer Jeffrey Levy-Hinte worked on the 1995 docu "When We Were Kings," about the Ali-Foreman fight proper. Drawn to the unedited backstage and concert footage that had languished in the vault, he has sculpted it into a fast-paced overview of the event that showcases both Ali and Brown at the pinnacle of their powers.
As talent gathers at a New York airport, on-site preparations are so chaotic that there's dispute over concert's actual start date. Meanwhile, talent erupts in impromptu jams everywhere, from plane to Kinshasha tarmac to urban marketplaces. Chief instigators are Celia Cruz and her band, who seem to be everywhere and later whip the crowd into a frenzy under energetic bandleader Johnny Pacheco.
Emotional high points are numerous: When asked what he's doing in Africa, late writer-scenester George Plimpton enthusiastically waves a glass and blurts, "I'm drunk in Africa!," while promoter Don King talks of his "mode of operandi" in organizing the extravaganza. Performer Miriam Makeba's ex-husband, late black nationalist Stokely Carmichael, greets Ali, who cautions him, "Don't burn up nothin' over here," even as BB King placidly smokes his pipe while eyeing "the beautiful ladies." Late Spinners lead singer Philippe Wynne even climbs into the ring with Ali during training, with predictably humorous results.
Concert proper kicks in about a third of the way through. The Spinners glide through "One of a Kind (Love Affair)," Makeba does her novelty hit "The Click Song," and Brown, whose "Soul Power" opens pic, returns for spirited, sweaty renditions of "Payback," "Cold Sweat," "I Can't Stand Myself" and "Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud)." In all, pic sports some 14 numbers from nine acts, most of them mercifully complete.
Tech package is as clean as could be expected from 30-year-old 16mm stock. HD transfer gives the authentic grain a velvety feel that's perfectly in keeping with the contempo aesthetic. Sound mix is full and muscular. Pic, of which 35mm prints will be struck, is "in memory of" nine participants or influences who have since passed away. Levy-Hinte promises the entire concert on DVD, "but that," he writes in the press notes, "is another mountain." Bring it on.

"When you bad," boasts the young, beautiful, piss-and-vinegar-filled Muhammad Ali  early in the documentary Soul Power , "you can do what you wanna do." The film, which takes too long to get to the meat of its matter, but captivates once it does, is an addendum to Leon Gast 's Oscar-winning 1996 documentary When We Were Kings . Ali's bravado-soaked words, breezily tossed off after he disrupts a Don King  press conference, also serve as an artist's manifesto for the film's musical acts: Celia Cruz , the Spinners, Fania All-Stars , Bill Withers , B.B. King , Miriam Makeba , and others.
Culled by director Jeffrey Levy-Hinte  from the 125 hours of footage shot by Paul Goldsmith , Kevin Keating , Roderick Young , and Albert Maysles  and relegated to the vaults after Gast didn't use it in Kings , Soul Power  documents the three-day music festival that accompanied the iconic 1974 Muhammad Ali/George Foreman  "Rumble in the Jungle" boxing match in Zaire . The concerts, meant to be a cultural exchange between African and African-American musicians (the late, great Cruz fiercely reps Cuba in a movie-stealing number), were briefly imperiled after a Foreman eye injury forced a postponement of the fight. When finally mounted, the shows became the stuff of pop culture folklore. Given the power of many of the performances, and the dreary state of modern Black pop, Soul Power  itself might well be subtitled When We Were Kings.
The film begins with lovely, if clichéd, day-in-the-life shots of ordinary Africans (a young mother strapping her two babies to her body before starting a trek down a dirt road; a boisterous street bazaar), as well as press-conference and travel footage of the artists; a mid-air jam session, in which a member of Cruz's band improvises a Pepsi  can as an instrument while Cruz keeps time by pounding the heel of her shoe against the overhead compartment, is especially cool. But this first act is largely padding, bogged down in the tedious chronicling of assorted logistical nightmares that accompany such an undertaking.
The irony is that headliner James Brown  is one of the least impressive of the performers. He's wonderful, but familiar. Much badder is Cruz and her sprawling, sexily raucous band; Bill Withers, with his sparse and aching acoustic performance of "She's Gone" (an especially brave choice of song given that most acts focused on mid- to uptempo numbers to rouse the crowd); and Miriam Makeba's "Click Song," introduced with a vigorous assertion of cultural pride ("It's not a noise, but my native tongue").
Infusing these performances with a political heft that resonates across eras is a press conference at which Ali dismantles a white reporter's utopian race rhetoric. With nationalistic counter-attack, Ali calls out entertainers and athletes who don't dedicate themselves to the uplift of their people—the yin to the yang of James Brown's observation that "Dollars is what this thing is about. You cannot get liberated, broke."
