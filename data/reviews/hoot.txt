Walden Media, the bringer of all things feel-good and educational (The Chronicles of Narnia
, Because of Winn-Dixie
), presents its newest bit of sunshine with the somewhat endearing Hoot
. The story follows Roy Eberhardt (the doe-eyed Lerman), a middle-schooler relocated from his beloved Montana to the pristine beaches of Coconut Grove, Fla. As the new kid, Roy faces angry bullies and more than one critical remark about his cowboy boots. Eventually, Roy�s only-in-the-movies investigative resolve propels him to explore the identity of a mysterious boy. Soon enough, Roy befriends the mystery boy, otherwise known as Mullet Fingers, a sun-bleached teen who sleeps in a boat, sprints his way around town, and lives to protect the Florida wildlife. Meanwhile, a corporate pancake house plans construction on land that happens to be the home to some adorable burrowing owls. A bumbling police officer (Wilson) investigates the incessant pranks designed to halt construction, including crocodiles in the toilets, deflated tires, and deadly snakes. And when we finally learn (surprise!) that Mullet Fingers and his plucky stepsister (Larson) are involved, the kids get into some hijinks, eventually emerging triumphant to save the owls. Based on the Newberry Award-winning novel by Carl Hiaasen (the first young-adult novel by the Floridian journalist and author), the film strives to live up to the quirkiness of the book but falls short. While the novel is drenched in Hiassen's wit, sense of adventure, and aggressive environmentalism, the film emerges as a vanilla comedy, only slightly more interesting than most. Previously released Walden films include the excellent Holes
, but Hoot
 lacks the complexity and humor that made Holes
 such a joy. However, Hoot
�s efforts don�t go completely unrewarded. Lerman is endearing as the spirited lead and Wilson brings charm and humor to his witless character. The reliable Nelson essentially repeats his role from Holes
 but is enjoyable nonetheless. First-time producer Jimmy Buffett takes a silly turn as Roy�s marine-science teacher and contributes five new recordings to the soundtrack. And ultimately Hoot
 feels a bit like a Buffett song: kinda fun, but ultimately not contributing anything of significance or complexity to the world. Doubtless, the best sequences are the long, sweeping nature shots: beautiful expos�s of the Florida coastline. But, for all its environmental themes, the plot doesn�t deliver any substance about its namesake: the burrowing owls. Earnest, playful and eco-friendly, Hoot
 is a worthwhile visit for the tween set, but parents may role their eyes more than once at this flightless film.


''Hoot," the new film adapted from Carl Hiaasen's 2002 young-adult novel, isn't the most elegantly made movie. Writer-director Wil Shriner comes from TV -- he made a lot of ''Frasier" episodes -- and it shows. Close one eye and you could mistake the film for an After School Special.
So what? ''Hoot" tells kids they can make a difference in this world, and that's worth a hundred ''Ice Age 2"s. Of the several different messages knocking around in the movie -- overdevelopment is bad, nature is good, don't stand on a golf course during peak drive-time -- the most effective is the simplest: You have more power than you think.
After six relocations in eight years, 13-year-old Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) is once again the new kid in town, instantly preyed on by the bullies who ride the bus with him to Florida's Coconut Cove Middle School. As Roy is getting thrashed one day, he glimpses a barefoot boy (Cody Linley) running at blinding speed alongside the bus, and his curiosity grows into an obsession.
Someone, meanwhile, keeps vandalizing the wooded construction site where a Mother Paula's Pancake House franchise is about to be erected, and it's driving site foreman Curly (Tim Blake Nelson) crazy. Kind but dimwitted town cop Dave Delinko (Luke Wilson) tries to catch the culprit but has his cruiser windows spray-painted black when he falls asleep on night watch. In his high-rise office in the city, Mother Paula regional manager Chuck Muckle (Clark Gregg) fumes and shouts.
They're all helpless against the barefoot boy, who turns out to be a military school runaway nicknamed Mullet Fingers (because, uh, he can catch mullets with his fingers). He, in turn is cared for by his stepsister Beatrice (Brie Larson), a fearsome middle school soccer jock who keeps Roy and other nosy parkers at bay. The movie hints just enough about the miserable home life of these two for us to be glad we don't know more.
Why do these kids care about a parcel of dirt? Because the holes in the ground are filled with burrowing owls and their young -- endangered species that Muckle would just as soon bulldoze. The movie takes a longer view as well, wondering how much building is too much in a fragile ecosystem like Florida (or, it's implied, your own town). Says Mullet Fingers, ''As long as I've been growing up here, I've been watching this place disappear."
He's the Edward Abbey-style nature boy of the film, in touch with the manatees and dedicated to monkey-wrenching the Man. Roy is a more lawfully minded kid and his ethical dilemma is the film's. I see by my daughter's book report that Hiaasen's novel delved more deeply into these issues, but they're present in the movie and well worth chewing over when the lights come up.
''Hoot" comes from Walden Media, the small ''family values" studio that has been turning thoughtful young-adult books like ''Holes" and ''Because of Winn-Dixie" into solid little movies (and that successfully rolled the dice on ''The Chronicles of Narnia" last year). The movie balances cardboard comic bad-guys with believable teenagers, has the courage to avoid romance, and unlike most Hollywood films suggests parents can be helpful and loving as well as clueless. (Parrothead alert: Jimmy Buffett coproduced the film, sings on the soundtrack, and has a role as Roy's very 
laid-back science teacher.)
The one thing ''Hoot" gets wrong is the title. Burrowing owls grumble, chatter, scream, and say ''coo-coo," but they don't hoot, and as far as I can tell that's a great horned owl dubbed onto the soundtrack. But the film nails the sound of a young person getting empowered, which is all that matters.


         Any kid who has been shuttled from home to home as the result of a parent's job should understand the particular angst of Roy Eberhardt.
 
  He's barely settled into Montana at the beginning of "Hoot" when he's uprooted to Florida, his 10th locale in 14 years. As Roy confides, he is reminded how every new school experience can be different, yet oddly the same. One can't help feel something akin regarding "Hoot," which takes a subject as unusual to youth audiences as ecoterrorism and makes of it something insistently generic.
 


         






    What does Roy (Logan Lerman) rediscover when he arrives in Florida? That bullies are as big and fat as they are always portrayed, that his parents are as weirdly oblivious to his suffering as parents in kids' movies invariably are and that almost everyone who is not Roy Eberhardt is either loud or rude or incredibly stupid.
 
  The stupid sobriquet goes to Officer David Delinko (Luke Wilson), an inept policeman assigned to patrol a planned Pancake House site that seems to be hitting a lot of roadblocks.
 
  The loud representative is building foreman Curly Branitt (Tim Blake Nelson, affecting his best Don Knotts yahoo bellow), who is stymied in his efforts to keep the Pancake House site from being vandalized.
 
  The rude honors are split between bully Dana (Eric Phillips) and soccer champ Beatrice (Brie Larson), who can out-whup Dana and who gives Roy a hard time from the get-go.
 
  Beatrice is trying to throw Roy off the scent of a mysterious blond teenager named Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley), who is always chasing about in bare feet. You can run, but you can't hide from a name like Mullet Fingers.
 
  What does any of this have to do with ecoterrorism? There are owls nesting on the property of the planned Pancake House. Dumb cops and fat bullies notwithstanding, there are enough odd elements at the story's core to separate it from the flock of teen-hero adventures.
 
  But any charm and character ascribed to Carl Hiaasen's bestselling book have been homogenized in Wil Shriner's flat screenplay and direction.

Don't let the Carl Hiaasen pedigree fool you: Hoot  is an Afterschool Special too crummy to give a hoot about. Roy (Logan Lerman), the new kid at a Florida middle school, tries to save a clearing of owls from a corporate meanie who wants to pave paradise and put up a pancake house. Incidentally, are we meant to read anything into the way that Roy befriends a girl soccer hellion (Brie Larson)  the Kristy McNichol role  yet shows far more interest in the local runaway, a barefoot sprinter (Cody Linley) styled to look like Christopher Atkins in The Blue Lagoon ? Just asking.

 Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman, who played Bobby  on the WB series "Jack and Bobby") is the only child in a family that's constantly relocating for his father's work. At 14 he's once again the new kid, this time in the tiny Florida beach town of Coconut Cove. While ducking the school bully (Eric Phillips), Roy spots a mysterious barefoot boy (Cody Linley) who appears to be living on his own in the woods. With the reluctant help of the school's soccer star, Beatrice (Brie Larson), Roy makes the acquaintance of this wild child.  When the three of them discover that a  construction site is threatening the habitat of an endangered species of owls, they set out to sabotage the building project, incurring the wrath of a national restaurant chain and baffling a clueless local cop named Officer Delinko (Luke Wilson).  This sweet-natured but plodding adaptation of a young-adult novel by Carl Hiaasen could have used a little less broad satire of corporate greed and a few more, well, owls. The  critters peep from their burrows for only a few brief moments, whetting the young audience's appetite for a nature film that never emerges.  What "Hoot" does get right is locale. The director Wil Shriner, a Florida native, captures the laid-back mood of a Gulf Coast beach town, the kind of place where a middle-school science teacher (the musician Jimmy Buffett, who also produced the film) wears shorts so he can go surfing after school, and dismisses class with the word "mañana."  "Hoot" is rated PG for what the press notes call "mild bullying and brief language." This objectionable content must be mild and brief indeed, because it passed this reviewer by entirely.

"Hoot" is a lightweight, eco-conscious kidpic about three youths uniting to protect endangered owls from developers in South Florida. New Line release is opening as counterprogramming to presumptive blockbuster "Mission: Impossible III." But the pic's dawdling pace, predictable plotting and absence of marquee players will likely make mom and dad think twice about chaperoning. Squeaky-clean, family-friendly opus should fly higher in homevid.
Making his feature filmmaking debut, vet TV helmer (and former talkshow host) Wil Shriner has adapted -- faithfully, if not thrillingly -- an award-winning young-adult novel by Carl Hiaasen, the Florida-based author better known for adult-skewing tomes such as "Strip Tease" and "Skinny Dip."
Middle-schooler Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman of TV's "Jack & Bobby") prepares for yet another semester as the new kid on the block; because his father (Neil Flynn) accepts frequent job transfers as a Justice Dept. employee, Roy's been to eight schools in the past six years. The latest move finds him leaving Montana for Coconut Cove, Fla.
Roy makes a serious sartorial blunder on his first day at the new school -- he wears boots and jeans, not a T-shirt and flip-flops -- and earns the nickname Cowgirl. Things get worse for Roy as he runs afoul of a bully (Eric Phillips), then inadvertently antagonizes Beatrice (Brie Larson), a tomboyish soccer player.
All of which helps explain why Roy is so eager to befriend another young outsider, a barefoot, sun-baked runaway known as Mullet Fingers (Cody Linley), a wiry teen who lives in a deserted fishing boat and repeatedly sabotages the construction of a national-chain pancake restaurant on a site where burrowing owls nest.
Shriner emphasizes broad comedy and cartoonish slapstick as Mullet Fingers -- aided by Roy and Beatrice -- employs stealth, cunning and, occasionally, a few well-placed snakes and baby alligators to make life miserable for a dim-witted site supervisor (Tim Blake Nelson) and his corporate greedhead boss (Clark Gregg). In sharp contrast, long stretches between comic set pieces are almost soporifically mild.
Nelson and Gregg overplay gamely, earning a few chuckles here and there. But top-billed Luke Wilson, as a none-too-bright beat cop who fancies himself a great detective, proves even funnier while taking a slightly subtler approach to tomfoolery.
The three young leads are earnest but bland, frequently upstaged by attractive Gulf Coast locales (mostly in and around Ft. Lauderdale) beautifully lensed by Michael Chapman. Singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett (who co-produced the pic and cameos as Roy's science teacher) contributes some nifty covers of pop hits and a few original tunes for the pleasant soundtrack.
