         Creativity is one of life's true mysteries, but that hasn't stopped people from attempting to analyze and trivialize the source of the artistic impulse. Yet the mystery always triumphs, as it does in the simplistic but strangely poetic "Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus."
 
  "Fur" stars Nicole Kidman as Arbus, one of the 20th century's signature American photographers. "Her startling portraits of dwarfs, transvestites, freaks and nudists," wrote biographer Patricia Bosworth, "redefined people's notions of normal and abnormal."
 


         






    Despite Bosworth's presence as a co-producer, "Fur" is not an attempt at a conventional biopic but what it calls "an imaginary portrait." Directed by Steven Shainberg and written by Erin Cressida Wilson (the team that brought you the bondage-friendly "Secretary"), "Fur" has an unusual aim.
 
  "What you are about to see," an opening title card reads, "is a tribute to Diane: a film that invents characters and situations that reach beyond reality to express what might have been Arbus' inner experience on her extraordinary path."
 
  Which is a fancy way of saying that "Fur" is on one level a facile cause-and-effect gloss on Arbus' life, a complete fantasy that reductively reduces the complex drives that go into the creation of an artist to a relationship with an unusual man. It's the cinematic equivalent of the questionable theory that El Greco painted the way he did because he had astigmatism and simply couldn't see the world any better.
 
  Yet, and this is where the mystery comes in, the certainty Shainberg and Wilson bring to the project — and the sophisticated acting by Kidman and Robert Downey Jr. as that mysterious man — forces us to take this film more seriously than it otherwise deserves. It remains simultaneously too far-fetched and thesis-driven to be convincing and too feelingly done to be ignored.
 
  "Fur" opens with Arbus fairly radiating happiness as she sits on a bus headed, it turns out, for a nudist-colony photo shoot. Smiling and confident, she looks over a list that reads "hunchbacks, slaughter houses, albinos." It's an inventory that wouldn't bring a grin to all faces, but that's the point: We are meant to recognize an artist discovering herself.
 
  The bulk of "Fur," however, is spent, in a flashback that begins three months earlier, when the Arbus we see is so repressed and stifled that the first image shows her buttoning her buttons all the way up to the top.
 
  This Arbus is a careful mother to her two children and a dutiful daughter to her overbearing, high-society parents, David and Gertrude Nemerov (Harris Yulin and Jane Alexander), proprietors of the Fifth Avenue fur emporium called Russek's.
 
  She is also wife and assistant to Allan Arbus (Ty Burrell of "Friends With Money"), a photographer who speaks up for his wife's camera dreams, though he himself does sterile commercial work.
 
  Although "Fur" takes pains to paint Diane's husband as loving, concerned and decent, it's clear that working in this atmosphere has not done wonders for her. This constraint is signified, in typically unsubtle fashion, by a scene of Arbus standing on a balcony and unfastening all those carefully buttoned buttons.
 
  But hark, salvation is at hand. A new tenant named Lionel (Downey) is moving into the Arbus' building, a man whose face is always masked and whom Diane feels unaccountably drawn to.
 
  After a brief horror film-type buildup that emphasizes his strangeness, Diane goes up to Lionel's apartment, which looks like the lair of a fairy tale wizard, with the idea of discovering his secret and taking his photograph.
 
  Lionel's secret is that every inch of him is covered in rich, luxurious hair (the veteran Stan Winston Studio gets credit for the remarkable design). He looks, in fact, quite similar to the Beast in Jean Cocteau's "Beauty and the Beast," an admitted influence, and, like the beast, he turns out to be the most charming of men.
 
  More than that, Lionel liberates Diane's hidden voyeur, becoming her tour guide to the universe of people who may look different but really are the nicest folks in the world. No Lionel, "Fur" insists, no great photographs.
 
  Obviously, this is all supposed to be taken metaphorically, but "Fur" undercuts that aim with a series of all-too-literal maneuvers. For one thing, husband Allan, clearly threatened by Lionel's charisma, grows a thick beard. For another, those familiar with Arbus' work will notice that the people she meets tend to look exactly like the subjects of her most famous photographs. How convenient.
 
  Most irritating of all, "Fur" falls back on a cop-out ending that undercuts its message about the unimportance of surface differences in favor of a glib finale that tries to have its cake and eat it too.
 
  Yet whenever you get too irritated at "Fur's" pretensions, the remarkable acting of its two stars pulls you back in and keeps you watching.
 
  Kidman, the most consistently daring of today's top stars, is exceptionally convincing as someone whose interior process plays out in front of us. And Downey, for the most part using only his soulful, yearning eyes and a silky, urbane voice, creates a man no one could resist. Separately and together, they make us believe the unbelievable.

It's been a while since we saw a truly boggling sophomore slump, one of those infamous second-act follies, like Steven Soderbergh's Kafka , made by a  director blinded with ego and overreach. Steven Shainberg, who made the winsomely rascally Secretary , has now followed it with Fur , subtitled ''An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus.'' Working in a style that's like David Lynch meets A&E Biography , Shainberg ''imagines'' the three months of Arbus' life in 1959 just before she became an artist.
Since Arbus was dark, compact, intense, and Jewish, she is portrayed  of course  by Nicole Kidman, acting in a mode of blurred-out sodden distress. A pampered, stifled Manhattan housewife, Arbus, attuned to the sights and sounds that no one else registers, meets the reclusive Lionel (Robert Downey Jr.), who has a disorder that  causes his face and body to be covered with hair. He looks like a member of the Addams Family, and the film envisions their ''grand romance'' as a lachrymose, inert Phantom/Elephant Man/Beast  cliché. Embodied by Downey with a sweetness  that never makes him interesting, Lionel introduces Arbus to his freak friends  many, many freaks. But this is the film's real violation. Diane Arbus took her walks on the wild side, but her true subject was the freakishness of the ordinary  people made grotesque from the inside out, frozen and isolated in the godless modern world. Shainberg reduces this most disturbing of all photographers to a portraitist of Halloween.

 In Leopold von Sacher-Masoch’s novel about humiliation and marble-white flesh, “Venus in Furs,” a seductress named Wanda taunts the man who would be her slave, “And so now fur arouses your bizarre fantasies?” Impatient for the inevitable answer (yes, and how), Wanda begins “coquettishly draping herself in her splendid fur, so that the dark, shiny sables flashed delightfully around her breasts, her arms.” From such turgid lust and swollen prose a perversion is born, as well as a slow-burn Velvet Underground song.  The new film “Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus” is a fantasy of a different order. Its marble-white Venus is Nicole Kidman, who here wears a conceit rather than a sable. The film’s core idea is that Arbus, who trained her photographic gaze on nudists, twins, grimacing children and the retarded, liberated her muse by coaxing out her inner freak. The film conjures a conduit to her liberation in the furry form of Lionel, a neighbor played by Robert Downey Jr. The actor’s involvement is something you need to take on faith, since he spends most of the film covered in fur, a costume that suggests the bewitched prince in Cocteau’s “Beauty and the Beast” and makes Mr. Downey look like an immaculately groomed Shih Tzu.  “Fur” is a folly, though not a dishonorable one. It was directed by Steven Shainberg, whose last feature, “Secretary,” was a tender love story about a shy masochist and the boss who spanks his way into her heart. The film was funny and modest, and it treated the putative perversions of its characters with the kind of good, gracious humor that insists on respect for everyone involved. “Fur” is a more ambitious work, in part because of Ms. Kidman, whose talent cannot obscure that she has been grievously miscast and left to indulge her mannered coyness.  The fetish of casting high-wattage movie stars, no matter how badly they fit the role, is one of the maladies of contemporary independent and quasi-independent filmmaking.  In 1971, at age 48, Arbus swallowed a large number of barbiturates and then, perhaps to make sure that she had finished the job, slit her wrists. Born Diane Nemerov into a wealthy New York family (her brother was the poet Howard Nemerov), she met Allan Arbus, played by Ty Burrell, when she was 14 and married him as soon as she was legal. He introduced her to photography and she served as his assistant. Together they worked for fashion magazines and on advertising campaigns, including those for her family’s department store, Russeks,  which was known for its furs. According to Arbus’s biographer, Patricia Bosworth, Diane’s father understood how to drape women in ermine. “Fur,” he said, “creates a protective image.”  One woman’s protective image is another woman’s sexual fetish is another woman’s fictional gamble. In “Fur,” Mr. Shainberg’s screenwriter, Erin Cressida Wilson, who also wrote “Secretary,” twists the classic Freudian concept of sexual fetishism, having apparently decided that the best way to explain Arbus’s singular perspective on the world is to transform her into a fetishist. Thus, in this formulation, Lionel, her fuzzy neighbor, becomes a kind of walking, talking fetish, a means  — to freedom, creativity, imagination and what Ms. Bosworth calls the dark world — that will usher her into a new realm. This sounds more promising than what materializes on screen largely because Mr. Shainberg and Ms. Wilson have turned Arbus’s life into a neurotic fairy tale.  Maybe they just got hung up on the repeated mentions of the word fur in the opening chapter of Ms. Bosworth’s biography. Whatever the case, they, like their subject, wander into dangerous territory, though without the same inspired results. In 1957, Arbus stopped working with her husband and began wandering New York after dark taking photographs. It’s instructive that the film doesn’t mention that she also studied with the photographer Lisette Model, whose interest in everyday people, with their odd shapes and suffering faces, was an obvious influence. The idea that art can also arise from example and instruction just wouldn’t jibe with the film’s vision of an otherworldly kingdom in which hard work, ego and depression of the sort that probably claimed Arbus’s life have no place.  And, so, in “Fur,” the Park Avenue princess leaves the bright world and climbs up, up, up to Lionel’s enchanted garret filled with objets d’exotica and mounds of fur as neatly coiled as sleeping cats. Through her furry friend, she meets an armless woman, a dominatrix and many dwarves. She lets down her hair, goes sleeveless and abandons her husband and children to squalor.  Ms. Kidman bears no physical resemblance to Arbus, who was small and dark and seemed very much tethered to the earth, perhaps because that is where she found the grist for her genius. Tall, pale and almost transparently thin, Ms. Kidman floats through the beautiful production design like a feather. She whispers to Lionel, who whispers in return. What are they saying? Damned if I could hear.  “Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has some discreet nudity, some adult language and intimations of sexual deviance.
Do artists actually see more than ordinary people? That's what my high school art teacher thought. So, apparently, does Nicole Kidman or at least that's the way she plays Diane Arbus  (192371) in the celebrated photographer's exceedingly curious "imaginary portrait," Fur .
Kidman acted around a prosthetic proboscis to win an Oscar for her impersonation of Virginia Woolf  in The Hours ; as Arbus, she's all eyes. Menacingly demure, she stares down the camera as though miming the X-ray vision of the photographer's gaze.
Arbus "could insinuate anguish, kinkiness, mental illness with any subject," Susan Sontag  unkindly observed. Everybody that Arbus photographed became a freakthat was the source of her particular genius. Fur has little interest in making the normal seem freakish; unlike Arbus, the movie benignly does the opposite. Physically, the fair-skinned and willowy Kidman is an unlikely choice to play the dark, diminutive Arbus. But the actress is far from the only curiosity in director Steven Shainberg 's cabineta misguided tribute to the woman his film identifies among "the greatest artists of the 20th century."
Hardly a straight biopic, Fur  was written by Erin Cressida Wilson , who invents all manner of characters and situations to explicate the three-month period in 1958 when Arbus ceased to be her husband Allan Arbus 's studio assistant and became a photographer in her own right. Initially, she's imprisoned in A-line skirts and Peter Pan  collars, pathetically attempting to please her high-powered father (Harris Yulin ), a Park Avenue furrier, and cold, judgmental mother (Jane Alexander  in the movie's scariest performance). Hubby is sympathetic in the condescending '50s mode: "Maybe you could take a class, Diane."
Taking a class is what the actual Arbus did. But that's not the process Shainberg and Wilson have in mind. Arbus is monstrously depressed, repressed, oppressed, and alone. "Even our children think I'm strange," she whispers to Allan (Ty Burrell ). As well they might. When her parents take over her studio for their annual fashion show, complete with leashed ocelot, a humiliated Diane flees to the fire escape. There she spots a mysterious masked man on the street and attracts his attention by unbuttoning her bodice.
Two weeks later, Diane receives a return call. She's distracted mid-shoot a half-dozen smiling model housewives providing Shainberg's most surreal tableaubecause something has clogged her plumbing. Thus the movie enters the world of metaphor by way of Alice in Wonderland  and Jean Cocteau . Along with a tangle of animal hair, a key tumbles from the water pipe, and Diane is inspired to photograph the strange fellow upstairs. His apartment of mystery turns out to be an annex of a Times Square  flea circusit presages Arbus's trademark subject matter, even as the baroque clutter is the antithesis of her straightforward mise-en-scéne.
The master of this domain is as adorably hirsute as a wookiee. Lionel (Robert Downey Jr.)  doesn't suffer from hypertrichosis so much as revel in it, like a model in mink. He also provides Diane's entrée to a warm and cuddly sideshow underworld. "This is terrific," she whispers unconvincingly, watching a naked submissive dancing with a leather-corseted dominatrix. "Look at his socks!" Downey, alternately haughty and beseeching, flirts coyly from behind a forest of facial hair. Around the time Lionel confides that he's spent his life looking for a "real freak" (and poor Allan defensively grows a beard), Diane manages to open a passage to Lionel's and throw a party for all the once and future denizens of her photographs.
"Most people go through life dreading they'll have a traumatic experience," the real Arbus famously said. "Freaks were born with their traumas. . . . They're aristocrats." Fur  takes this as the basis for a fairy-tale Beauty and the Beast . Labored magic realism aside, the movie closely resembles Shainberg's 2002 Secretary . That dark comedy of psychosexual pathology, which Wilson expanded from Mary Gaitskill 's terse account of workplace s/m, gave Maggie Gyllenhaal  a star-making turn as a fragile creature in the employ of James Spader 's stern lawyer. Their waltz of mutual disinhibition whipped a potentially grotesque case history into a romantic love story; Fur  uses a similar tale of successfully sublimated masochism to dramatize Arbus's artistic awakening. In this case, though, the scenario is both foolishly allegorical and painfully literal-minded.
Of course, the heroine's awakening could also be read as a torturous nervous breakdowndespite the feel-good ending. But Fur isn't really about Diane Arbus. The photographer suggested that the camera gave her permission to transgress. Kidman's choice of roles follows the same logic, without the same success. You won't learn much about Arbus, aside from the correct pronunciation of her first name; you will get to see Kidman try (and fail) to find her inner freak.
