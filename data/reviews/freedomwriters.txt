The success story of English teacher Erin Gruwell (Swank) and her students in Room 203 of Long Beach High School is true. Yet when placed in the hands of writer/director LaGravenese, it becomes indistinguishable from what my colorful friend-of-a-friend Bishop calls �them movies where the cute little white lady goes in and makes everybody love learnin' just because she cares so much.� If Erin Gruwell didn�t exist, screenwriters would invent her. Relentlessly cheerful despite the opening footage of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Gruwell fails her first few lessons � white girls from Newport Beach shouldn�t lecture to urban gang kids about Tupac � but finally wins her students� respect with journaling and individualized instruction. I should mention that she implements these classroom techniques, which are not supported by her administration, by buying her kids books and field trips (she�s got two extra jobs, see) and complaining directly to the school board about her pickle-sucking, bureaucratic boss (the redoubtable Staunton, who�s a hoot) without getting fired. So if you�re a classroom teacher, try that, I guess? As her neglected spouse, Dempsey stares off vacantly and suffers from a lack of his own calling before packing up those two symbolic suitcases. LaGravenese thinks he�s being sympathetic to his characters and exploring them deeply, but because of its Hollywood shorthand the movie actually gets dangerously close to suggesting that the answer to the education crisis is workaholic superteachers who can personally compensate for their students� poverty and social problems � leaving no room for family. Meanwhile, as Gruwell teaches �tolerance� to her African-American and Chicano students using the Holocaust as a model of oppression, I was constantly reminded of Ariyan A. Johnson�s rant from the little-seen Just Another Girl on the I.R.T.
 � a far more offbeat and risk-taking film released in 1992, when this one is set � about the greater relevance to people of color of the slave trade, a genocide no less literary. The real-life Gruwell is a sought-after educational consultant, but the movie itself offers few real answers to the problems teachers face. Nonetheless double Oscar-winner Swank is a pleasure to watch; she�s fully tuned in to her character�s gawky, geeky giddiness � the well-intentioned naivete that makes her unsinkable. Also watch out for Hernandez, who makes a strong impression as the classroom�s most troubled student, even though the film�s perspective is muddled by the inclusion of her voiceover.


The cynical half of the movie reviewer's brain
: Would you look at that? They've gone and remade "Dangerous Minds," that Michelle Pfeiffer inner-city-high-school movie from 1995. With all the cliches intact, no less.
The earnest half of the movie reviewer's brain
: Oh, stop it. "Freedom Writers" isn't a retread.
Cynical half:
 Of course, it is -- there's nothing here that wasn't in "The Blackboard Jungle" and "To Sir with Love" and "Stand and Deliver" and "Finding Forrester."
Earnest half:
 How can it be a retread when it's based on a real teacher, Erin Gruwell of Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, Calif., and her real students, and their real accomplishments?
Cynical half:
 Because Hollywood knows how to turn an inspirational story into boilerplate. The troubled, unreachable kids who come around in the last reel, the hidebound school bureaucracy, the doubts, the breakthroughs. The Top 40 soundtrack.
Earnest half:
 Feh. You forget that the young audience "Freedom Writers" is made for hasn't seen any of those other movies. More to the point, almost all films work from shopworn premises. It's the job of the cast and crew to pump them up with new life and meaning -- to make them matter all over again. And writer-director Richard LaGravenese and his actors do just that. The movie works
.
Cynical half:
 All right, I'll agree the dialogue is unusually well-written, and that the young cast gets under the skin of their roles -- especially April Lee Hernandez, Mario, and Jason Finn as three worst-case gangbangers who pick up journals and start writing their way into the wider world.
Earnest half:
 Exactly. And the world they're starting from -- the post-Rodney King LA of the mid-'90s -- is believably depicted as a soul-killing war zone.
Cynical half:
 But what about Hilary Swank as Gruwell? She's just so . . . so . . .
Earnest half:
 White?
Cynical half:
 Yes.
Earnest half:
 And bouncy and idealistic and upper middle class and completely clueless about her students' lives. Refreshingly, "Freedom Writers" doesn't sugarcoat the teacher's own learning curve or its effect on her marriage to a handsome guy (Patrick Dempsey) who isn't as strong as she is. Gruwell's whiteness, her otherness, becomes irrelevant as soon as the students see she's not lying to them. They never quite let her off the hook, though, and in a weird, comical way that becomes a sign of respect. Swank starts as a Barbie doll and ends as a mother bear.
Cynical half:
 Imelda Staunton can't do much with her role: The mean old teacher who resists the rule-breaking newcomer.
Earnest half:
 She does seem like a vague version of Judi Dench in "Notes on a Scandal," doesn't she? All the adult roles are underwritten. It doesn't matter. "Freedom Writers" is about the abiding love affair between a gifted teacher and her students. Gruwell's job is to show how their struggles have precedent in other people's lives and in history. She gives them context and teaches them to express themselves within it.
Cynical half:
 Thus the Holocaust history lessons.
Earnest half:
 You've got it. Reading "The Diary of Anne Frank" and meeting death-camp survivors (who play themselves) gives the kids a perspective they've never had and an impetus to do something with it. Although I agree it's a little odd seeing Pat Carroll cast as Frank's protectress , Miep Gies, who did visit the school at the students' invitation.
Cynical half:
 And I agree the kids' individual triumphs seem satisfyingly hard-won. That scene where the one boy who hasn't spoken all year finally reads his journal is a killer.
Earnest half:
 You were crying. I saw it.
Cynical half:
 Problem with my contact lens.
Earnest half:
 You wear glasses. Just tell people to go see the movie already.
Cynical half:
 Go see the movie already.


         As a tenacious teacher, Hilary Swank transforms 'Freedom Writers.' Among the lessons to be learned from the inspiring, feel-good drama "Freedom Writers" is never to underestimate the persuasive powers of Hilary Swank. Even in writer-director Richard LaGravenese's formulaic adaptation of "The Freedom Writers Diary," a compilation of journal entries written by Long Beach high school students, Swank shows that in the right role her unusually disarming talent can elevate routine material.
 
  As real-life teacher Erin Gruwell, Swank enters with coltish enthusiasm, dangerous naivete and a toothsome smile that suggests maybe she isn't up to the task of turning a classroom full of hardened teens, embittered by their hateful environment, into scholars.
 


         






    Amid the schematic setup of Gruwell attempting to win the trust of the students while overcoming the red tape of the system, something fairly amazing happens. Just as Gruwell the teacher starts to regain her balance after a rocky beginning, Swank the actor likewise kicks into gear, shrugging off the impediments of the stereotypical scenario and turning what might have been a routine, entirely forgettable January release into a surprisingly moving experience.
 
  In scene after scene, it's a marvel to watch Swank determinedly making her case, shrewdly winning over the audience as Gruwell persuades her charges to give her a chance to turn them on to literature, history and the opportunity to share their own narratives. There is a raw, guileless quality to Swank that shreds any hint of condescension or exploitation.
 
  Intoxicated with the possibility of the students succeeding, the character's growing confidence becomes tangible, playing over Swank's face like a kid learning to ride a bike. Initially charming but skittish, Gruwell emerges as a fighter, every bit as resolute as Swank's Maggie Fitzgerald in "Million Dollar Baby."
 
  The film itself, set in the aftermath of the 1992 Los Angeles riots, suffers from the over-familiarity one feels toward the whole dedicated-teacher-inspires-students-against-all-odds genre, compounded by fatigue for the telling of minority stories through a white protagonist. Almost evenly divided among Latinos, Cambodians and African Americans (plus one scared-to-death white kid), the class seethes with the racial tension that spills in from the streets outside. The school, epitomized by an obstinate department head (Imelda Staunton) and an imperious honors instructor (John Benjamin Hickey), refuses to "waste" actual books on them, an attitude Gruwell can't abide.
 
  The everyday violence experienced by the students is established as both the stimulus that divides them and the eventual basis for their bonding. Their distrust of the new teacher will be recognizable to anyone who has seen "Dangerous Minds" and any number of other movies and telefilms featuring a crusading teacher and at-risk students.
 
  The individual students emerge more as types than clichés and are mainly distinguishable by the strength of the actors (spotlighted are April Lee Hernandez, Jason Finn and Mario). Some of the actors seem a little old to be playing high schoolers, but that is almost a given for the genre and is likely in part to make the 32-year-old Swank more credible as the fresh-out-of-college Gruwell.
 
  In supporting roles, Patrick Dempsey adds bittersweet wit as Gruwell's neglected husband, and Scott Glenn plays her skeptical father. .
 
  Dramatically, the movie never veers from its predictable course, but Swank's performance renders the point moot. There likely was a better, more original movie to be made focusing more on the Freedom Writers themselves, but if this more conventional direction had to be taken, it's hard to imagine a more affecting version.
 

 
  "Freedom Writers." MPAA rating: PG-13 for violent content, some thematic material and language. Running time: 2 hours, 3 minutes. In general release.   

 Correction Appended  As a cinematic subspecies, films about teachers working with throwaway kids tend to follow a predictable arc involving conflict and resolution, smooth beats and bitter tears. Sometimes, as with “Dangerous Minds,” the 1995 film in which Michelle Pfeiffer uses her cheekbones to disarm high school toughs, the results are risible. Sometimes, as with the egregiously offensive “187” (1997), wherein Samuel L. Jackson makes like Charles Bronson with some bad students, it’s an argument for universal home schooling.  “Freedom Writers,” a true story about a white teacher trying to make a difference in a room crammed with black, Latino and Asian high school freshmen, has the makings of another groaner. One worrisome sign is Hilary Swank, the two-time Academy Award winner with the avid smile who recently vamped across screens as a femme fatale in Brian De Palma’s period thriller “The Black Dahlia.” Ms. Swank is an appealing actress of, at least to date, fairly restricted range. In her finest roles — a transgender man in “Boys Don’t Cry,” a boxer in “Million Dollar Baby” — she plays women whose hard-angled limbs and squared jaws never fully obscure a desperate, at times almost embarrassingly naked neediness.  In “Freedom Writers” Ms. Swank uses that neediness to fine effect in a film with a strong emotional tug and smartly laid foundation. She plays Erin Gruwell, who in 1994 was a 23-year-old student teacher assigned to teach freshman English at Wilson High School in Long Beach, Calif.  Twenty-two miles from downtown Los Angeles, this ethnically diverse port city, birthplace of both Bo Derek and Snoop Dogg, is south of Compton (home of N.W.A.), right at the edge of Orange County (home of “The O.C.”). In 1992 the Rodney King riots that rocked Los Angeles spilled into Long Beach; recently the city made news for an alleged hate crime involving black teenagers charged with severely beating three white women.  By the time Erin steps into her classroom, a scant two years after the riots, the climate inside is at once frosty and scorching. Turned out in a cherry-red suit and black pumps, her strand of pearls gleaming as bright as her teeth, Erin cuts an unavoidably awkward, borderline goofy figure.  The students are understandably skeptical, excruciatingly contemptuous. From where they sit, slumped and hunched, some with their backs literally turned away from the front of the room, Erin looks like the stranger she is. She’s an interloper, a do-gooder, a visitor from another planet called Newport Beach, and the class sees through her as if she were glass because the writer and director Richard LaGravenese makes sure that we do too.  Funny how point of view works. If so many films about so-called troubled teenagers come off as little more than exploitation, it’s often because the filmmakers are not really interested in them, just their dysfunction. “Freedom Writers,” by contrast, isn’t only about an amazingly dedicated young teacher who took on two extra jobs to buy supplies for her students (to supplement, as Mr. LaGravenese carefully points out, a $27,000 salary); it’s also, emphatically, about some extraordinary young people. In this respect Mr. LaGravenese, whose diverse writing credits include “The Ref” and “The Bridges of Madison County,” appears to have taken his egalitarian cue from the real Erin Gruwell, who shares author credit with her students in their 1999 book, “The Freedom Writers Diary,” a collection of their journal entries.  Mr. LaGravenese keeps faith with the multiple perspectives in the book, which includes Ms. Gruwell’s voice and those of her students, whose first-person narratives pay witness to the effects of brutalizing violence, dangerous tribal allegiances and institutional neglect. The film pops in on Erin and her increasingly troubled relationship with her husband, Scott (Patrick Dempsey), and there’s a really lovely scene between the two that finds them talking ruefully over a bottle of wine about the divide between fantasy and reality in marriage, a divide one partner tries to bridge and the other walks away from. But while we keep time with Erin, we also listen to the teenagers, several of whom tell their stories in voice-over.  Among the most important of those stories is that of Eva (the newcomer April Lee Hernandez), whose voice is among the first we hear in the film. Through quick flashbacks and snapshot scenes of the present, Eva’s young life unfolds with crushing predictability. From her front steps, this 9-year-old watches as her cousin is gunned down in a drive-by shooting. Later her father is arrested; she’s initiated into a gang. One day, while walking with a friend under the glorious California sun, a couple of guys pull up in a car and start firing in their direction. Eva dodges bullets and embraces violence because she knows nothing else; she hates everyone, including her white teacher, because no one has ever given her a reason not to.  In time Eva stops hating Erin, though the bullets keep coming. It’s a hard journey for both women, one that includes other students, most of whom are played by actors who look too old for their roles and are nonetheless very affecting. None of these actors are outstanding, but two are memorable: the singer Mario, who plays an angry drug dealer, Andre, and another newcomer, Jason Finn, whose big, soft, moon face swells with fury and vulnerability as a homeless teenager named Marcus.  Mr. LaGravenese isn’t a natural-born filmmaker, but he’s a smart screenwriter whose commitment to characters like Marcus makes up for the rough patches in his directing. Like Ms. Swank, who shares the screen comfortably with her younger co-stars, he gives credit where credit is due.  “Freedom Writers” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is some gun violence and adult language.  Correction: January 04, 2007  The headline for a film review in Weekend on Friday about “Freedom Writers” misidentified the California city in which the movie is set. It is Long Beach, not Los Angeles.  The listing of credits omitted a producer. Danny DeVito was a producer, along with Stacey Sher and Michael Shamberg. 

Another movie about a well-meaning, white-bread teacher thrust among the savages? No, not by a long shot. Although "Freedom Writers" is the latest in a long line of saint-saves-students stories, it takes the bold approach of being earnest, honest and unafraid to be called naive. As a result, it's extremely affecting. Presided over by a sensitive, open performance by Hilary Swank and blessed by a gifted group of young actors, the drama could win hearts and dollars, especially if Paramount pushes pic's humanity over its presumed nobility.
There are moments in this, screenwriter Richard LaGravenese's third feature as a director, that may require viewers to take shots of insulin, but Swank's performance overcomes the shock of the sentimental: As Erin Gruwell -- the real-life teacher who, with her students, wrote "The Freedom Writers Diary" -- she is a delicate piece of fresh meat for a school of young high schoolers who are better-versed in street fights than Robert Frost.
Armed with ambitious lesson plans and dreamy ideals, Erin arrives at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, Calif.,thoroughly ill-equipped for a student body raised according to the ethics of urban tribalism. Swank portrays Erin's awe, panic and ultimately her very courageous resolve to be who she is and fight on.
Better known for his screenwriting ("A Little Princess," "Beloved," "The Horse Whisperer"), helmer LaGravenese mixes stylistic maneuvers while hitting very few speed bumps. Starting out with footage of the Los Angeles riots of 1992 (the film is set in '94), he sets up the students' psychology through an internal dialogue narrated by one student, Eva (April Lee Hernandez), a Latina gang member whose worldview is shared by her peers: Their streets are a war zone, and school, while relatively safe, is an exercise in futility.
Arriving at Woodrow Wilson for her first day, Erin meets her soon-to-be nemesis Margaret Campbell (a terrific Imelda Staunton), who eyes Erin's string of pearls with apprehension. Margaret -- and the audience -- just know those pearls are going to be ripped off Erin's neck by some felonious student; they eventually serve as both MacGuffin and talisman.
Well shot by Jim Denault, "Freedom Writers" is a good-looking film, although it treads on shaky moral ground. Why does it always seem that a well-to-do white teacher is towing minority kids out of the intellectual quicksand of their environment? In this case, because the story is based on the real-life Erin Gruwell and her real-life class.
More crucially, "Freedom Writers," initially at least, paints such a hopeless picture of underprivileged black and Latino teen lifethat many viewers would advise Erin to throw in the towel. Eventually, however, the desperation of their circumstances adds luster to Erin's work in the classroom.
Most of the movie takes place in that classroom, where Erin hits upon "The Diary of Anne Frank" as a way into her students' hearts and minds -- and as a motivation for their own journal writing, a collection of which became the book on which the film is based. A visit to the school by Miep Gies (Pat Carroll), the Dutchwoman who helped hide the Franks (and still lives in the Netherlands), is virtually guaranteed to reduce even the most jaded viewer to a heap of weepy gelatin.

Neither Half Nelson nor all bad, this white- teacher-uplifts-poor-kids- of-color drama aims to favor the students' stories, which are based on those of real-life Cali  high schoolers who wrote their way out of oppression and anonymity in the mid '90s. But those diary entries too often take a backseat to the film's "Ms. G.," played by two-time Oscar winner and Chad Lowe  survivor Hilary Swank , who makes instantly credible her character's preference of work over marriage to a boring man-behind-the-woman (Patrick Dempsey ). Our eager-beaver heroine suffers the kids' sarcasm, fails to earn their respect by bringing in a Tupac  tape, then wins them over in a crucial scene that, fact-based or not, rings as false as anything in Dangerous Minds . Reaction shots of the class's befuddled white boy are played for cheap laughs, but writer-director Richard LaGravenese  otherwise keeps it real by recruiting cinematographer Jim Denault  from Indieville High and Imelda Staunton here playing Bitchy Old Department Head.
