Ghosts indeed: This romantic comedy by name alone attempts to make funny � not to mention culturally relevant � the kind of swinging-dick misogyny that went out of fashion years ago. In the spirit, but not the complexity, of such oil-slick cinematic seducers as Alfie and Roger Dodger
's Roger Swanson, celebrity photographer Connor Mead (McConaughey) is a quantity-over-quality kind of guy. He dumps last week's conquests via teleconference as he's already undressing his next lay. Love, he argues, is nothing more than "magical comfort food for the weak and uneducated," a sentiment he lifted from his mentor, Uncle Wayne (Douglas). Wayne has been dead for years, but he makes a surprise appearance � to the eyes of Connor alone � at the wedding of Connor's younger brother, Paul (Meyer). Wayne, the Marley surrogate in this A Christmas Carol
 reimagining, then ushers Connor through an evening of reflection and reckoning, with the overall aim of nudging him back into the arms of his first love, Jenny (Garner, with negligible screen time). Several of the supporting players do nice work, especially Stone (Superbad
) as the brace-faced ghost of Connor's first girlfriend; she injects a genuine spunkiness into a film that's mostly predictable and deeply cynical. As he's aged, Douglas has had some fun with go-big roles such as Wayne, and he appears to have styled this one after Hollywood mogul Robert Evans circa the Seventies: turtleneck and shades and swimming in sex. He's a quaint relic � not nearly as amusing as co-scripters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore seem to think he is � but harmless enough. Not so with McConaughey's wolfish Connor. Perhaps in the hands of a more capable, less coasting actor, the character might have played like something more than a toxic spill. (And make-up and wardrobe have done him no favors, with his Easy-Bake tan, attack of the Crest Whitestrips, and too-literal interpretation of Connor's oiliness; in duller stretches of the film, I could think of nothing but taking blotting papers to his face.) Director Waters, who began his career with the edgy, unsettling The House of Yes
 and also made the kicky Mean Girls
, lately has been peddling much softer stuff (see 2005's insipid Just Like Heaven
). Ghosts of Girlfriends Past
 requires a certain finesse � really, how do you sell a romantic comedy about a twisted womanizer, and how do you get the audience to buy his inevitable turnaround? � and neither Waters nor his leading man are up to the task.

With "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past," Matthew McConaughey completes his transformation into the George Hamilton of his generation. Fit, profoundly tan, rested from sybaritic pleasures we can only guess at (I do hope they still involve bongos), the star now exudes a lazy self-mockery that extends to whatever boondoggle of a movie he finds himself in. Each hoist of his eyebrows seems to say, "I've survived 'Fool's Gold,' darlin', and I'll survive this."
"Ghosts" is better-than-average McConaughey swill, but not by much  - that's its pleasure and its curse. The movie's a "Christmas Carol" revamp with the star playing a cosmic stud Scrooge who hates marriage rather than the holidays and who views love as "magical comfort food for the weak and uneducated." Only a very rude critic might apply such a description to the movie itself.
McConaughey is Connor Mead, a celebrated Manhattan photographer who appears to do everything in triplicate: He shoots three magazine covers at once and breaks up with three girlfriends in a single video conference call. Having been tutored in the art of womanizing by his late Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas, doing an amusingly oily Rat Pack turn: Gordon Gekko by way of producer Robert Evans), Connor is a god of casual sex. Men want to be him, women want to do unprintable things with him, and McConaughey just looks like the cat who swallowed the birdcage.
But it's a chick flick, which means Connor needs to be punished, right? Arriving at the Newport, R.I.,  wedding of his earnest kid brother Paul (Breckin Meyer) and fiancee Sandy (Lacey Chabert), the hero encounters childhood sweetheart Jenny (Jennifer Garner), a tart-tongued doctor who hasn't forgiven him for one night of hit-and-run sex a decade earlier. (Newport, by the way, is played by various Bay State locations, not that you can tell.)
He also runs into the ghost of Uncle Wayne, who warns Connor that three spirits will show him the past, present, and future error of his ways. It's in this midsection that "Ghosts of Girl-friends Past" is at its most cheerily playful, with Emma Stone goosing the film's energy level as Spirit #1, a sardonic, braces-wearing teenager to whom Connor long ago lost his virginity.
The two revisit the scenes of the hero's youth  - humiliations at middle school dances and so forth  - via a flying four-poster bed, and then Connor's assistant Melanie (Noureen DeWulf) turns up as the ghost of girlfriends present, even though she's not a ghost or his girlfriend. (If you're looking for logic, you're at the wrong movie.) Very, very slowly, our man is made to understand he has been a pig, and McConaughey looks as though he's dragged unwillingly every step of the way.
But can you blame him when Connor gets to come on to the bride's cougariffic mother (Anne Archer) in a scene as effective as it is ludicrous? Oversubscribed with characters, "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past" drops the lovely Archer like a hot tamale and mingles with others: Robert Forster as the bride's Marine dad; Rachel Boston, Camille Guaty, and Amanda Walsh as horny bridesmaids; Daniel Sunjata as a Mr. Perfect wedding guest who might sweep Jenny off her feet.
The dialogue is bright and shallow, the pacing brisk, and Rolfe Kent's score tells you exactly what to feel so you don't have to go to the bother yourself. There's a decent slapstick bit involving a tippy wedding cake and even a smidgen of meta-comedy here and there, rare moments when you realize director Mark Waters isn't asleep at the wheel.
Unfortunately, the plot demands that Connor must reform, and since no one here seems to buy such a notion, why should we? The last 15  minutes of "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past" is a dreadful forced march through the conventions of romantic comedy tidying-up, with a "funny" car chase, everyone neatly paired off and the snarling rake of a hero revealed to be the softest of Mr. Softees.
McConaughey looks like he's having none of it. Actually, the star appears to have vacated the premises at around the 80-minute mark, well before Connor pledges eternal troth. He's there physically, of course, but the lewd light in his eyes has gone out. Mentally, he's on a beach in Mexico, hoisting an umbrella drink and saying, "Come on in, darlin', the water's fine."

 A smear of petroleum jelly might have done wonders for “Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,” a junky-looking romantic comedy that’s neither remotely romantic nor passably comic. An old trick used to soften facial lines, greasing a lens or filter can diffuse the image and, much like candlelight, bring a touch of glamour to a scene. And if ever a movie needed to have its hard lines eased with some cheap glamour, it’s this one: a crude gloss on Dickens’s “Christmas Carol,” it tracks a high-flying photographer who, on the eve of his brother’s marriage, is forced by several ghosts to revisit a life dedicated to sexual catch and release.  Matthew McConaughey, flashing choppers so blindingly white that he could light his own premiere, plays Connor Mead, one of those rom-com  roués whose itchy libidos hide the usual sensitive soul. He’s a cad — he breaks up with three women simultaneously during a video conference — but, really, he’s just heartbroken and waiting for the right woman to help him heal. That would be Jenny Perotti, a childhood friend played by an uncharacteristically hesitant Jennifer Garner, whose performance suggests that she knows  that she’s strictly backup. Less a co-star than a place holder (you can almost see the words “enter generic female lead” in Jon Lucas and Scott Moore’s screenplay), she delivers her indulgent smiles so wanly that her requisite thaw feels more like capitulation than like love.  The director Mark Waters, who typically does better by his actresses, proves of no help to Ms. Garner or anyone else. (Given his smoother work on “Freaky Friday” and “Mean Girls,” it’s hard not to wonder if this production itself were haunted.) Whether by contract or default, “Girlfriends” is strictly a one-man show, a vehicle for Mr. McConaughey’s diminishing returns. While there’s still a little charm under that permatan, it’s getting tougher for him to sell the goods on only a smile. He might still be capable of delivering an actual performance again, giving up something other than mannerisms (sauntering walk, crinkling eyes, flashing grin), but he needs a director who can help him get going. Age isn’t easy, even for golden boys.  The movie  makes much the same point with Uncle Wayne, Connor’s lifelong bad influence. Played by an insistently watchable Michael Douglas, Uncle Wayne is a cautionary tale incarnate: an old-school playboy wrapped in a leathery casing who appears to have been at least partly based on the Hollywood producer Robert Evans. Now mostly famous for being famous and, to an extent, for his autobiography, “The Kid Stays in the Picture,” Mr. Evans produced classics like “Chinatown” once upon a time. Although Mr. Douglas’s face is often obscured with tinted, oversize glasses and a luxurious wave of hair, almost as if he were trying to duck the camera, he brings this ghost to freakish life. The lizard king  no longer rocks, but he certainly does slither.  “Ghosts of Girlfriends Past” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Sexual stereotypes galore.

Marriage, rather than Christmas, is the object of scorn for the 21st-century Scrooge who's forced to take stock in "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past," a second-rate sex farce that ponders the weighty question of why a rich, flashy, good-looking New York fashion photographer with hot-and-cold-running babes might prefer not to get hitched. The story of how he got that way proves passably amusing at times, but this New Line hand-me-down to Warner Bros. is mostly clunky and vaguely unsavory. Matthew McConaughey-Jennifer Garner starrer might find a niche as counter-programming amid the imminent "X-Men Origins: Wolverine"/"Star Trek" onslaught, but overall prospects look moderate.
Very much like their previous outing for New Line, the dismaying (and surprisingly commercial) "Four Christmases," Jon Lucas and Scott Moore's latest script consists of a tour of sorts through the whys and wherefores of the leads' emotional lives. Both are medium-high-concept comedies that should have been immeasurably better worked out and written than they are, but get by due to their attractive casts and uncouth humor.
The personality of Connor Mead (McConaughey), a cocky, insanely successful Gotham shutterbug, is defined at the outset when he blithely breaks up with three women simultaneously by video conference call just as he's nailing his latest conquest. Then it's off to Newport for the dreaded wedding of his younger brother, Paul (Breckin Meyer) -- dreaded because the merest thought of marriage sends Connor into paroxysms of horror. He's not even polite enough to hide his disdain for the sake of his only kin, who lives in baronial splendor at a seaside mansion where most of the action unfolds.
While slurping booze and hitting on the one bridesmaid he hasn't already shtupped, as well as the bride's attractive divorced mother (Anne Archer), Connor encounters his long-deceased Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas, channeling Robert Evans), the roguish Don Juan who raised Connor after his parents died and tutored him in the techniques of conquest and the advisability of emotional detachment.
But the old playboy's phantom has not reappeared to reassure his protege, but rather to warn him that he's about to be visited by the ghosts of girlfriends past, present and future, and that he's not going to like what he sees. Thus commences an abridged journey through Connor's erotic education, a trip that spins on his past with the one woman he let get away, Jenny (Jennifer Garner), who happens to be part of the wedding party.
The flashbacks to the teenage Connor (Logan Miller) being shown the ropes by Douglas' roue are at least somewhat engaging, even if they could have been carried off with vastly more verbal sophistication and physical elan. Conducting the tour is Connor's first g.f., the dizzy, frizzy-haired Allison (Emma Stone), who initiates the bashful kid after young Jenny (Christa B. Allen) ditches him for an older jock.
Amusement level slides rapidly from here on, as glimpses of ghosts two and three showing Connor how shallow he is and how awful his future will be are intercut with mostly awful scenes of the wedding weekend falling apart, graced by the continual shrieking of the would-be bride (Lacey Chabert). Denouement is hardly surprising.
Connor's blithe disregard for his brother, whom he claims to love, and his slovenly behavior run counter to his otherwise sophisticated image, and the character in general is simply too wantonly immature to cotton to on any level. His banter with women, marked by a frankness they find bracing, provokes a certain pleasure, but McConaughey can't supply the absolute charm that would make the guy appealing despite his noxious behavior.
Garner is OK in the limited role of Connor's longtime object of desire, while Archer unfortunately gets sidelined after the effective scene in which she lets Connor go on and on about how he'd like to take her upstairs. It's impossible not to enjoy Douglas with his carefully coiffed hair, dark glasses and recollections of orgies of yesteryear, but he could have knocked this characterization out of the park with better dialogue.
Production values are modest.


Two weeks after jowly Matthew Perry  transformed into pretty Zac Efron  to relive his adolescence in 17 Again,  Warner Bros. releases Ghosts of Girlfriends Past,  another backward and backward-looking child-is-father-to-the-man rom-com, with Matthew McConaughey , who, 18 years Efrons senior and slightly butcher, has just a few more years of prettiness left. With its relentless Mars-Venus split between the sexes, Ghosts of Girlfriends Past  might also remind you of Warner Bros. miserable, borderline-misogynist Valentines Day offering, Hes Just Not That Into You.  Above all, it will make you long for a day when studio movies about relationships feel like they are by and for adults who have actually been in one.
McConaughey plays NYC  celebrity photographer Connor Mead , a rutting horndog who tries to convince his kid brother, Paul (Breckin Meyer ), about to tie the knot in Newport , that marriage is an oppressive institution. "Every night, I swim in a lake of sex," big bro boasts, unintentionally conjuring up a stomach-churning image of bodily fluids four fathoms deep. One of the bridesmaids is Jenny (Jennifer Garner ), a childhood friend of the roué with a maddening tendency to psychologize Connor: "I wont tell anyone you have feelings," she defensively notes. The man-whore will be redeemed, of course, guided by the apparitions of his Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas , dressed up like Robert Evans ), who home-schooled him in piggy behavior, and his first conquest, the acid-wash-clad Allison (Emma Stone ).
Mark Waters , who directed the excellent Lindsay Lohan  vehicles Freaky Friday  and Mean Girls (the LiLo-ish Stone only reminds you of those much better movies), helms Ghosts of Girlfriends Past  like a wedding video shot by a drunk cousin. His task isnt made any easier with the risible script by Jon Lucas  and Scott Moore  (who also wrote Four Christmases ), which is full of nuggets like "Pain eats regret every day of the week and twice on Sunday." The cast fares no better: The absolute null that is McConaughey seems to be channeling Jim Morrison s Lizard King  persona (the real stud here is father-of-the-bride Robert Forster , a sexy sexagenarian confident enough to forgo hair plugs). Garner just looks embarrassed in her scenes with the leading man, hoping, perhaps, that she can disappear into her own dimples.
A film exhaustingly devoted to extolling the virtues of men and women settling down, and the concomitant pleasures of snuggling ("Spooning isnt as nice as forking," the pre-emotionally rehabbed Connor asserts, one of the many weird sex-as-puncture metaphors that also includes referring to Uncle Waynes love-mobile as the "Stabbin Wagon"), Ghosts of Girlfriends Past  still finds it necessary to indulge in a little Smear the Queer. "Tell me this guys gay," Connor says of the gentlemanly doctor who starts chatting up Jenny at the rehearsal dinner. "You look like a gay pirate," Jenny snorts to a Jesus-haired Connor, then working for Herb Ritts , during a time-travel scene to the 90s. When Connor thinks his assistant has refused to ball him because shes a lesbian, she corrects him: "That was just one time in college. I went to Barnard. I had no choice." One of Connors former bedmates appears to have been so traumatized by his rakish behavior that shes transitioned from F to M.
With the presence of both Douglas and Anne Archer , as the brides mom, the specter of an equally retrograde movie haunts Ghosts of Girlfriends Past.  Playing a middle-class couple in Adrian Lyne s odious 1987 thriller Fatal Attraction,  Douglas and Archer reassured us of the sanctity of bourgeois family life, vanquishing home-wrecking crazy single lady/career woman Glenn Close . Though the films operate in two very different genres, their message is very much the same: Being unattached is a pathology, one that can be cured by bathtub murder or slow-dancing to REO Speedwagon . Start cuddling, guys and galsor else.
