Equal parts Ray Bradbury and rickety carnival spook show, this animated tale of a carnivorous, haunted house and the band of neighborhood kids who decide to put it out of commission feels maddeningly unfinished, as though it were tinkered with in postproduction, rejiggered unnecessarily, and finally let loose during the entirely inappropriate summer months, when, as any kid worth his or her pile of Fangoria
s (or any adult worth his or her collection of Famous Monsters of Filmland
) could tell you, it ought to be arriving on All Hallows Eve. Bad timing aside, the story by Dan Harmon and Rob Schrab (plus Pamela Pettler) � the writing team behind the cult Jack Black/Owen Wilson pilot Heat Vision and Jack
 � is a wispy thing that, surprisingly, given its Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis producerial pedigree fails to adequately evoke the sheer kidhood magic of the Halloween season. It's set on October 30, sure, but the whole of it never quite jells, and like the old trick-or-treat standby, candy corn, it leaves you wishing for so much more of everything else. After a brilliant opening sequence that references Zemeckis' own Forrest Gump
 by way of Roald Dahl, we're introduced to DJ (Musso), an ordinary 12-year-old transitioning from being a Halloween fanatic to a teen with precious little time left on his internal gosh-wow, sense-of-wonder clock. Not so his pal Chowder (Lerner), who pines for the kiss of Hershey year-round and still has a firm grasp of what really matters in life, namely steering clear of neighborhood crank Mr. Nebbercracker (Buscemi) while basking in rubber- fright-masked anticipation of the best night of the year. When Nebbercracker suffers a heart attack in the midst of haranguing the trespassing DJ, after which the old man's dilapidated homestead literally attempts to eat the poor kid, the pair join forces with Alpha-girl prepster Jenny (Locke) to combat this architecturally-unsound holiday scourge. Monster House
's animation is its best aspect, working up a blood red and purpley color palette that fairly screams "Boo!" at you, but even the genuinely creepy sight of this monstrous manse uprooting itself from its foundation and chasing the trio down the block can't make up for the confused tone of the script, which is seemingly pitched at neither youngsters nor adults but at some indefinable horror-kid within. That said, those who came of age in an era when only hobos and ballerinas were seen trick-or-treating before sunset will still get a charge out of Monster House
's retro appeal. Those chaperoned by mom and dad, however, will most likely wonder what all the fuss was about.


``Monster House," the new computer-generated family film about a possessed mansion, is like one of those gross-out children's novelty books -- the ones with the googly eyes -- and it attracts a certain kind of kid. Personal anecdote: I took the family to the screening, and when the lights came up my wife was shaking her aching head in dismay, the 11-year-old was opining that she found ``Howl's Moving Castle " a much more elegant treatment of similar material, and the 9-year-old -- she sat there grinning in low-down rapture.
There's your demographic sweet spot: ``Monster House" is the first horror comedy made exclusively for fourth-graders.
It takes place in one of those suspiciously underpopulated movie suburbs, lighted with the hard clarity of digital animation. Earnest young DJ (the voice of Mitchel Musso ) is obsessed with the decaying manse across the street, owned by cranky old Mr. Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi ) and alive in some witchy way. We know this: If a stray ball lands on the lawn or a tricycle accidentally turns up the walkway, the toy is sucked inside, never to be seen again.
Why don't the adults notice? Because movies like this demand grown-ups be clueless or nasty. DJ's mom and dad (clueless) go away for the Halloween weekend leaving him with babysitter Zee (nasty, and voiced as such by Maggie Gyllenhaal ) and her dim rocker boyfriend Bones (Jason Lee ). With porky best pal Chowder (Sam Lerner ) and Jenny (Spencer Locke ), a prep school girl passing through the neighborhood with a wagonful of Girl Scout cookies, DJ attempts to discover the secret of the Monster House. Which of course means going inside
 it.
``Monster House" is from the people who gave us ``The Polar Express " and it uses the same digital technology: characters' movements are ``traced" from the actions of wired-up live actors. Where ``Polar" tried to create photorealistic humans and wound up with soulless zombies, though, this one stays sensibly on the cartoon side of the ledger. DJ and his pals have appealingly oversize heads and pipe-stem bodies; it's as though the Sims had turned out en masse for the audition. (The one remaining creepy touch: No eyelashes.)
The script, too, has some agreeable elementary-school wit before it settles down to massive destruction. DJ and Chowder are poised at the lip of adolescence, and their attempts to woo Jenny are hapless in the extreme. Those comedy gains are offset by a grimness on the movie's edges -- Chowder's home life sounds downright dysfunctional -- and by a performance by Nick Cannon , playing a fraidy-cat local cop, that borders on feets-do-yo'-stuff embarrassment.
The movie goes bananas when the kids finally get in the house, and there are enough zooming camera shots and things flying at the audience that you know ``Monster House" will be playing in 3-D somewhere (and so it is, at Boston Common and various suburban theaters). The mansion has a personality as well as parts that correspond to a human body -- the chandelier over the staircase, it turns out, is a uvula . (``So it's a girl
 house," marvels Chowder . )
Down the heroes go to the heart in the basement, the house kicking and screaming all the way. I won't tell you what's down there other than to say it involves the voice of Kathleen Turner , and that may be the scariest thing of all.
Even at 87 minutes, ``Monster House" overstays its welcome. The finale is an overbearingly loud chaos of splintered boards and sentiment: Just the sort of funhouse ride to thrill a kid while Mom and Dad reach for the noise-canceling headphones. Is it too scary? Not really: Like an E10+ video-game, the film's crude jolts don't stick.
If you're wondering what business a Halloween movie has being released in the middle of July, by the way, rest assured the DVD will be inescapable come October. The home-video tail is no longer wagging the dog -- it is
 the dog. For its own part, the movie's a big, rambunctious mutt: Fine for a play date , but think twice before letting it into your own house.


         When you're 12, nothing is as scary as puberty. Except, that is, if you happen to live across the street from a crotchety old man and his spooky, ramshackle house, the lawn of which has a tendency to consume toys, pets and possibly even people.
 
  In the animated feature "Monster House," the eerie domicile vexes young DJ, who peers at it from his upstairs bedroom window through a telescope, scribbling down every detail. It's an old-fashioned haunted house story that might have been lifted from a vintage episode of "Scooby-Doo," but it's freshly executed by young director Gil Kenan and a top-grade voice cast. Using the motion-capture technique popularized by one of the film's executive producers, Robert Zemeckis, in "The Polar Express," Kenan's hyperactive visual style aptly reflects the soon-to-be raging hormones of his pre-teen protagonists.
 


         






    DJ, voiced by Mitchel Musso, is a bit gawky and tries to hide his cracking voice from his clueless parents (Fred Willard and Catherine O'Hara), who depart the day before Halloween for a dental conclave of some kind. That's more than OK to DJ, who just wants to track the mysterious goings on at the home of his neighbor Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi).
 
  When DJ's portly best friend, Chowder (Sam Lerner), loses a brand-new basketball to the lawn, it triggers a confrontation with Nebbercracker that draws the boys into a life-and-death struggle, made only slightly less frightening by the appearance of the pert and resourceful Jenny (Spencer Locke), the thinking adolescent's dream girl. A redhead from a crosstown girls' school, Jenny enters the scene selling candy door to door with a pitch that would serve her well on "The Apprentice."
 
  The boys are smitten, but first things first: The trio must deal with the house that, it soon becomes clear, is somehow alive. After failing to convince the local two-man police force (Kevin James and Nick Cannon) of the imminent danger, DJ, Chowder and Jenny pool their talents to address the problem. Kathleen Turner plays the house — sort of; her expressions were captured and then animators modeled the building's movements on them, making it an actual character and raising the stakes considerably. The rollicking action sequences that follow are like a roller-coaster ride (an experience that is likely enhanced by seeing it in Real D, a 3D format available in selected theaters).
 
  The heart of the movie, however, is the relationships of the kids. The screenplay by Dan Harmon, Rob Schrab and Pamela Pettler is witty and intelligent, and the characters sound more real than those in most live-action fare. Supporting characters such as Maggie Gyllenhaal's punkette babysitter, Jason Lee's Keanu-esque rocker and Jon Heder's video game master/pizza cook are also memorable even in relatively brief screen time.
 
  Though it's far too intense for small children (8 and older seems a safe bet), "Monster House" finally has a return-to-innocence sweetness that recalls some of the work of another of its executive producers — Steven Spielberg. Kids may grow up too fast today to embrace the film's familiar message of the virtues of an unhurried adolescence, but it's nice to be reminded of the possibility.
 
 
'Monster House'

 
 MPAA rating:
 PG for scary images and sequences, thematic elements, some crude humor and brief language
 
 A Columbia Pictures release. Director Gil Kenan. Producers Steve Starkey, Jack Rapke. Screenplay by Dan Harmon & Rob Schrab and Pamela Pettler, story by Harmon & Schrab. Director of photograph   

The notion of a creaky old house that goes beyond haunted  a house that, in fact, actively haunts, lunging around the neighborhood to chase after the overly curious  is so cool, it's a wonder no one's ever thought of it before. The mysterious manse that gets star billing in the smartly delirious animated thriller Monster House  is possessed of windows like eyes and a flying bit of carpet that unfurls tonguelike out the front door to scoop up trespassers. Mr. Nebbercracker (voiced by Steve Buscemi), the old coot who lives inside, is only a minor meanie compared with this house that roars at three brave little neighborhood kids. (Other stars supplying vocals include Maggie Gyllenhaal, Kathleen Turner, and Napoleon Dynamite 's Jon Heder, who's sweeeet  as a videogaming pizza flunky.)
Feature first-timer Gil Kenan directs with a zingy sense of kids, comedy, fright, and visual perspective. But the movie also shimmers and shakes in all its motion-capture animated beauty with the slyly deep sensibilities of executive producer Robert Zemeckis. (Zemeckis' not-too-shabby fellow exec prod is Steven Spielberg.) Emotional darkness doesn't just loom in a Zemeckis movie  it taunts, it surprises, it winks, and sometimes, it flashes a skull grin when drawn, as in Cast Away , onto the surface of a ball called Wilson. It just so happens, a Wilson spheroid is gobbled up in Monster House , too: How freaky, and how fun.

 One of the spooky archetypes of childhood imagination — the dark, mysterious house across the street — is literally brought to life in “Monster House,” a marvelously creepy animated feature directed by Gil Kenan.  At first the house, which sits on a perfectly ordinary suburban block, seems like nothing more than the dilapidated home of Mr. Nebbercracker, a cranky old man with bad teeth, a gruesome comb-over and Steve Buscemi’s voice. It quickly becomes clear — to a plucky boy-detective type named DJ and his two young sidekicks, and then to everybody else — that the ramshackle Victorian is possessed by a malevolent, demonic force. It seizes toys; it eats people. And since this is a movie aimed at an audience for whom the grosser bodily functions are a perpetual source of laughs, it vomits them up again. The house roars, belches, spits fire and in the end turns out to be...Kathleen Turner.  If I say that “Monster House” is the best child-friendly movie of the summer so far (“Ant Bully” and “Barnyard” will expand the competition in the next few weeks), it may sound like extravagant praise — or maybe like faint praise. In any case, modesty can be numbered among the picture’s virtues, along with ingenuity. It runs a trim 86 minutes — during which I observed not a single fidget from my 7-year-old companions — and does not waste time on the Valuable Lessons routinely pasted onto family movies like nutrition labels on boxes of sugary cereal, to assure anxious parents that the junk has some value. “Monster House” is unpretentious, smartly written (by Dan Harmon, Rob Schrab and Pamela Pettler) and a lot of fun.  It also represents, to the technology nerds in the audience, an interesting refinement of animation techniques. Like Robert Zemeckis’s “Polar Express,” “Monster House” (for which Mr. Zemeckis served as an executive producer) uses the digitally captured movements of real actors rather than computer-generated algorithms as the basis for its animated images. The people in the movie look a little like molded-plastic figurines (the ones in “Polar Express” looked more like porcelain dolls), but their gestures are uncannily fluid and unpredictable, making you appreciate the quality of the acting more than you generally do in animated films. The postures and gestures of DJ (Mitchell Musso) and his pals — a pudgy fellow named Chowder (Sam Lerner) and a preppy redhead named Jenny (Spencer Locke) — have an authentically loose and antic look. They seem like real kids, rather than like super-cute, big-headed cartoon moppets.  And for the most part they talk and behave like real kids, too, or at least like characters drawn from the rich tradition of plucky, intellectually curious kiddie-lit heroes. DJ is descended from Encyclopedia Brown (perhaps by way of Jimmy Neutron, but never mind), and Jenny bears some temperamental resemblance to Harriet the Spy. I’m sure Chowder will remind you of someone in your fifth-grade class, wherever or whenever that was. The adults in the picture — DJ’s dithering parents (Fred Willard and Catherine O’Hara), who take off for a dental convention the day before Halloween, Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal), the grumpy sitter who takes their place, and the bumbling town policemen (Kevin James and Nick Cannon) — are predictably useless. The children, left to their own devices, must conquer the evil that, all but unnoticed, flourishes in their midst.    Mr. Kenan, making his feature film debut, is a lively storyteller. “Monster House” also bears the unmistakable creative stamp of Mr. Zemeckis and his fellow executive producer, Steven Spielberg. There are a few moments of amusing, self-conscious auto-homage: a Wilson basketball with a human face smudged onto it; plumbing fixtures that come to life with the slinky movements of “Jurassic Park” dinosaurs; a suburban Halloween out of “E.T.” But the deeper imprint of Mr. Spielberg’s influence, in particular, lies in the film’s evocation of childhood as a state of wonder tinged with darkness. The absence of supervising grown-ups is both scary and exciting, and the monstrous house will remind audience members of all ages of the pleasure of being frightened without pushing the fear past comfortable limits.  As in most ghost stories, the fright stands in for other emotions — grief, disappointment, loneliness — and the film’s climactic sequences combine hair-raising sensation with dreamy and delicate pathos. The plain suburban setting becomes (as it did in “E.T.” and Mr. Zemeckis’s “Back to the Future” movies) a zone of enchantment, in no small part because it seems so real.  “Monster House” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Some of the scary parts may be too intense for very young or very sensitive children.

Some sharp talent and technique has been applied to an old chestnut of a story in "Monster House," an increasingly resistable thrill-ride-style comic horrorfest. Godfathered by Robert Zemeckis and Steven Spielberg, supremely slick but overly in-your-face first feature by recent UCLA grad Gil Kenan reps the latest in the motion-capture animation process popularized by Zemeckis in "The Polar Express." Constant shock cuts and souped-up music and sound effects will keep small fry in a state of moderate petrification, while the trio of tweeny leads plus attitude-redolent cohorts will make teens feel welcome, spelling peppy summer B.O. returns for this Halloween-set haunted-house tale.
Kenan came to industry attention via his 2002 UCLA senior year short "The Lark," a live-action/animated horror fantasy that evinced a mindset well suited to Dan Harmon, Rob Schrab and Pamela Pettler's script (originally written for a live-action feature) about a mean-spirited house that's actually alive.
Helmer shows off his visual aptitude in the opening shot, which follows a red autumn leaf as it falls toward the ground in a pristine suburban neighborhood -- pristine, that is, save for an old dark house, flanked by rows of barren trees, that no one dares approach. Its fearsome owner is Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi), a skinny, dentally deprived hermit who, in the first scene, terrorizes a little girl and destroys her tricycle.
All this is observed from across the street by DJ (Mitchel Musso), a lanky 12-year-old who, with his chubby buddy Chowder (Sam Lerner), decides to challenge the eccentric old man. In the resulting altercation, Nebbercracker suffers an apparently fatal seizure and is carted away.
But that's just the beginning of the threat posed by the house. When trespassed upon, the place reacts in a variety of antisocial ways: The lawn can suck things underground, and the facade takes on an unnaturally human visage, with two upper windows as eyes, a peak above the porch roof as a nose and the front door as a mouth, out of which rolls a lengthy tongue-like carpet with frog-like snatching ability.
Some relatively deserving characters fall prey to the house's voracious appetite, beginning with Bones (Jason Lee), the amusingly odious b.f. of DJ's punky babysitter, Zee (Maggie Gyllenhaal), and a couple of cops (Kevin James, Nick Cannon) who, in classic Abbott and Costello mode, refuse for the longest time to believe what everyone else knows the house is doing.
Alert "Harry Potter" fans will notice the script shamelessly lifts the prime personality traits of J.K. Rowling's three most important young characters for its lead trio: Tall, dark-haired, serious-minded DJ is Harry, semi-dufus Chowder is Ron and their new cohort, smarty-pants prep school redhead Jenny (Spencer Locke), is Hermione. Together, they lay siege to the house, penetrating its deepest secrets, including the reason it can assume "human" and, ultimately, mobile form.
After shooting with live actors for 42 days in a "black box" soundstage to achieve credible movements and expressions, filmmakers then computer-animated both the environments and the thesps to give the picture its distinctive look. Characters are generally more facially nuanced than were those in "The Polar Express," an asset amplified by the overall excellent vocal work by a tasty ensemble of performers that also includes Kathleen Turner, Jon Heder, Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard. Pic's technical and design achievement is estimable.
But the overriding impression is assaultive to a progressively off-putting degree. Kenan keeps hammering away with stun-gun cuts, visual ammo suddenly flying in from out of frame and ear-splitting sound effects and music cues, to the point where at least part of the audience will want to tune out. In this respect, it is a theme-park ride, with shocks and jolts provided with reliable regularity. Across 90 minutes, however, the experience is desensitizing and dispiriting and far too insistent.
Quite a few shots look specifically composed for maximum effectiveness in 3-D, a process in which the pic will be shown in numerous situations.

Three kids are intimidated by a creepy old man named Nebbercracker (Steve Buscemi , animated in such a way that one can easily imagine how well he might have played Gollum ) and his frightening old house, which seems to literally consume toys carelessly left on its lawn. When Nebbercracker apparently has a heart attack, the house gets even scarier, acting autonomously and making scary "faces" with its windows, door, and porch. In this latest extravaganza from executive producers Steven Spielberg  and Robert Zemeckis , millions of dollars and long hours in the digital-animation studios have produced . . . a photorealistic, computer-animated, generic American suburb! The coolest thing about Monster House  is that Kathleen Turner 's face was actually motion-captured to create the house's movements, but actual human beings on-screen might have ratcheted up the tension, of which there is none.
