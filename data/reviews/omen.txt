It's a terrible sign for a movie when the sole reason for its existence is a satanic opening date. Yes, in case you've missed it, today is 06/06/06, perfect for Hollywood to deliver an otherwise pointless cabalistic blow to our heads. For this occasion, the blunt instrument is a remake of Richard Donner's legitimately scary 1976 horror flick, ``The Omen," about a couple unwittingly raising Satan's little boy.
Gregory Peck and Lee Remick played the couple in the original picture. Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles, both looking miserable, take the same parts in this new version, which John Moore has directed without much wit or feeling. The screenwriter for both movies is David Seltzer, who merely appears to have dusted off his original and handed it in to the studio. The first one was chilling. This remake is an icy bore.
It gets underway when an evil priest swaps the couple's newborn for a demon seed. He tells Roger Thorn (Schreiber) that their child died after labor and that this little orphan will make a perfect replacement. His wife, Katherine (Stiles), has no idea what's going on, but really, a mother always knows. Sort of. The adopted tot grows into Damien, a 6-year-old sourpuss played with one facial expression by Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick, and Katherine's awakening to his evil has to be beaten into her -- chiefly by the boy himself.
To put it mildly, the Devil pulls some strings, landing Roger a job as the US ambassador in London. So he isn't around when Damien puts his increasingly clued-in mom in the hospital. (Ladies, when Satan's kid is riding his Big Wheel around your mansion, never water your plants perched on a chair overlooking a 100-foot drop.)
Another priest (Pete Postlethwaite) keeps showing up to warn Roger that something terrible is afoot. So does an omnipresent photographer (David Thewlis), who happens to be building a fetching photo library of all the Devil's victims.
Eventually the atheistic Roger comes around, and his suspicion turns ``The Omen" into a chase picture, not unlike ``The Da Vinci Code," in which he and the photographer try to solve the mystery. But Moore shows greater interest in concocting a chic-looking movie than in making our skin crawl, and the violently loud score works harder than he does to spook us. (It succeeds only in producing migraines.) Beyond the alluring production design and some tasteless allusions to 9/11 and the Challenger disaster, it's hard to explain why'd we need another ``Omen."
Since nearly every Catholic-minded horror movie in the last 30 years has cribbed from Donner's movie, this remake's attempts to shock and surprise seem monotonously by the book. Even if you missed the '76 version, you already know what's going on. Material this stupid and this familiar needs a touch of camp, but Mia Farrow, as Damien's unholy nanny, is the only participant who brings the goods.
Now that no one seems to have the patience, interest, or skill to build a suspenseful, horrifying horror film, there's nowhere for the genre's misogyny to hide. Moore, for instance, saves his inspired shot-making for Stiles's demise. There are attractive images of her brushing her teeth in a big white room (it's the Oral-B commercial from hell), and the sequence of her plummeting from that balcony is beautiful. Why would someone with Stiles's talent want such a thankless part?
Stiles is punched, scratched, dropped, and worse. The fear in her face seems real: That kid playing Damien is no boy, he's Chucky the killer doll from the ``Child's Play" movies. There's no prestige in this kind of acting for her. But at next year's MTV Movie Awards, she's a shoo-in to win Best Frightened Performance.

         When the Lord, or whoever, offers you a release date like 06/06/06, you have no choice but to take it. Hence director John Moore's stunt remake of "The Omen," Richard Donner's classic of cornball '70s horror. Based on a script by David Seltzer, who also wrote the original, the movie is commendably faithful to its source, despite some early intimations that it might take off in a more topical — and interesting — direction. In the movie's only major departure from the original, it opens on a Vatican priest peering through a telescope, on the lookout for the celestial birth announcement signaling arrival of the Antichrist. When the seventh sign comes, he quickly alerts the ecclesiastical authorities, then prepares a PowerPoint presentation on the Apocalypse (which, surely, counts as the eighth sign) for a speechless pope.
 
  The End of Times is nigh, or at least that's what recent current events would suggest. And "The Omen" has the new footage to prove it, which is scary — possibly too scary for the filmmakers. The signs of the Apocalypse, which the movie has no trouble linking with events such as the fall of the twin towers, the tsunami in Thailand, the goings-on at Abu Ghraib, turn out to be a tease. Like its predecessor, "The Omen" remains at its core a domestic parenting drama. (Though in this regard too, things have gotten scarier since the '70s, or at least far more jittery and fraught.)
 


         






    Despite slick camera work by Jonathan Sela and intense, naturalistic performances by Liev Schreiber and Julia Stiles, "The Omen" retains the aura of ceremonious kitsch of the first movie, favoring a well-lighted, upscale Goth aesthetic punctuated with flashes of well-timed, cymbal-crashing shockers and giggly camp. Robert Thorn (Schreiber), the No. 2 guy at the American embassy in Rome, rushes to the side of his wife, Kate (Stiles), who has just delivered their child alone, last-century style. At the hospital, a priest tells Thorn his son has died in childbirth, but how would he like to adopt this newborn mystery orphan over here? (Sure, it sounds too good to be true, but when a priest, or whoever, hands you a boy to replace your stillborn child ... )
 
  Before long, the little foundling has blossomed into a creepy toddler with ink-black hair, azure eyes and a sinister pout. Damien (Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick) is not like other kids, to mom Kate's never-ending chagrin. (Thorn keeps meaning to tell her about the swap but never gets around to it.) His terrible twos get off to a big start at his birthday party, when his young nanny, with a nod from a lurking hellhound, hangs herself from a third-story window.
 
  Unlike Lee Remick's bad '70s mommy, who was prone to tossing the kid in the direction of the nearest butler whenever something more interesting came up, Stiles' Kate is not immune to the effect Damien has on others. During a group trip to the zoo, Damien terrifies the monkeys and spooks the other kids, but nothing is as terrifying as the pitying, judgmental glances of the other, smugger mommies.
 
  Naturally, Kate blames herself and seeks professional help. She enters therapy around the same time as a new nanny — played by Mia Farrow in a bit of stunt casting that she works to the hilt — mysteriously enters their employ. Mrs. Baylock (Farrow) is no longer the gargoyle-faced spinster of the original, she's now a creepily passive-aggressive child-care specialist, who assures the Thorns that she never forgets that she's "not the parent."
 
  Of course, these days, if there's one thing capable of sinking the conflicted mommy into a quagmire of self-loathing and doubt, it's hyper-efficient help. If any doubts remain that the vacant-eyed nanny is a devout bride-of-Satan type, they are dispelled in the scene in which she silently feeds the child strawberries in rapt devotion.
 
  Thorn, meanwhile, struggles with whether or not to spill the beans to his wife, especially after he's visited by a nut-job priest spouting fire-and-brimstone. Evincing a tragic lack of directness, Father Brennan (Pete Postlethwaite) skulks around like a caped Bela Lugosi, unpersuasively trying to talk Thorn into a ritual killing.
 
  Not that he comes out and states the problem — it remains unclear (or at least it did to me) whether Father Brennan was in on the deal to begin with and is now experiencing a David Brock-style lightning-bolt conversion to the light side. The suggestion is that the child was ushered into the world of influence by a cabal of bad priests, but what they're up to, and where they are now, remains a mystery. All we get, near the end, is a dream/repressed memory sequence of Kate's labor in which a cousin of Nosferatu's rubs his hands together in wicked glee and somebody holds up a placenta.
 
  Naturally, Thorn remains skeptical, even after Damien skewers the priest. What sways him is proof-in-pictures shown to him by a tabloid photographer. (How's that for diminished trust in the Catholic Church?) Keith Jennings (the marvelously ferret-faced David Thewlis) has been doggedly tracking the Thorn family and friends since noticing his photos have started to portend the freak deaths of Damien's closest acquaintances. Finding himself next on the list, he convinces Thorn to let him join him in a little detective work to uncover Damien's origins. A skim through the Book of Revelation and a jaunt through the Italian countryside later, the pair figures it out: Damien has been cleverly inserted into the world of politics in order to inflict maximum damage. It would appear that the devil knows what he's doing.
 
  Moore has ratcheted up the boo factor, more or less absent from the original, but neither he nor Seltzer cares to unpack the allusions set up in the opening scene. It says something about our capacity for looking beyond our own navels that the problem remains mostly en famille
. While Mom retreats into therapy and Dad tries to get to the root of the bait-and-switch, the world is coming apart at the seams. Who's minding the store? Damien glides to power as smoothly as he scooters through the polished floors of his mansion, and even the church leaves the solution to the discretion of his adoptive father. You adopt the Antichrist, buddy, he's your problem now.
 
 'The Omen'

 
 MPAA rating:
 R for disturbing violent content, graphic images and some language   

 When all else fails, pump up the thunder and lightning. That seems to be an operating principle behind the supremely unnecessary remake of "The Omen," the 1976 horror fest that, along with "Rosemary's Baby" and "The Exorcist," plunked everyone's favorite baddie, Satan, into the Hollywood mainstream.  The incessant rumbling and flashing that accompanies virtually every other scene underscores the hollowness of a story that in the decades since the original "Omen" has had any freshness trampled out of it by a rampaging army of Freddies, Jasons and Michael Myerses, not to mention assorted "Omen" and "Exorcist" sequels and knockoffs.  Another strategy is to empty the dog pound. To go with the thunder and lightning, the movie deploys a veritable kennel of snarling black Rottweilers bounding out of the bowels of hell to announce the presence of Beelzebub.  Yet I suppose an "Omen" redux makes sense as a crass gamble in an age of tabloid theology and as a product shrewdly timed to ride on the coattails of "The Da Vinci Code." Its epigraph reads: "From the Eternal Sea he rises/Creating armies on either side/Turning man against his brother/'Til man exists no more." That's what I call Revelation for Dummies.  Early in the movie a shot of the World Trade Center in flames, introduced as a portent of Armageddon, sharpens this remake's sour tang of exploitation. Aside from such touches (there's also a Hurricane Katrina devastation shot), the new "Omen," whose screenwriter, David Seltzer, wrote the original, slavishly recycles itself.  As before, respectable actors stoop to lend a spurious gravitas to all the muttering and scowling. Assuming the Gregory Peck role of Robert Thorn, the American ambassador to  Britain who refuses to believe his wife's hysterical insistence that their demonic little boy, Damien, is the ultimate bad seed, Liev Schreiber labors successfully to keep a straight face. In the Lee Remick role of Robert's wife, Katherine, Julia Stiles has taken another wasteful misstep in her largely mismanaged career; too intelligent and talented for this sort of rubbish, she should be following the same high road as Maggie Gyllenhaal.  The casting of Mia Farrow (the mother of "Rosemary's Baby") as Mrs. Baylock, the nanny from hell, lends "The Omen" a twist of gallows humor. Every spoonful of sugar dispensed by this apple-cheeked, sweeter-than-saccharine Mary Poppins is laced with arsenic. Jennings (David Thewlis), the paparazzi snoop whose pictures offer clues to the supernatural shenanigans, is appropriately disheveled. And Pete Postlethwaite and Michael Gambon squander their talents as nostril-flaring loons who know too much for their own good.  Directed by John Moore ("Behind Enemy Lines," "Flight of the Phoenix"), "The Omen" is terminally glum and waterlogged (from the downpours with the thunder and lightning). The only smiles to be seen are the faint traces of a smirk on Ms. Farrow's lips as her character carries out the Devil's work.  The movie's little jolts are effective for being so sparingly interjected. In the most unsettling scene, Damien's visit to a zoo riles up the animals; a gorilla tries to break out of its cage, and screaming children scatter in panic.  The most kinetic sequence is Robert's last mad dash to a church, clutching his screaming boy. A church is the only place where the little demon can be returned to hell. "Get Me to the Church on Time" doesn't begin to describe the horrors that will ensue if he's a split second behind schedule.  "The Omen" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has scenes of violence and some strong language.

The latest project from Bruce Springsteen that circumvents the nostalgic attraction of the E Street Band doesn't reduce the visceral appeal or emotional connection between singer and community. The "Seeger Sessions" album, begun as a tribute to one of America's finest song collectors and most significant interpreters of folk songs, the banjo-playing singer and social activist Pete Seeger, features songs so reworked that the connection to the 87-year-old legend is strictly in repertoire. The underlying link -- and this is what the concert evidences more than the "Seeger Sessions" album -- rests in the belief that songs can unite and educate even if they're nearly two centuries old, and that by bringing together story songs of tragedy, community, legends and unjust situations -- and letting the audience participate through singing and dancing -- the aud leaves a concert hall with a better perspective on the world. 
Few have been better than Seeger or Springsteen at spreading a gospel via a concert. The Seeger Sessions Band show Monday was rambunctious and sprawling yet possessed an obvious post-Katrina focus that Springsteen wove through the evening, a concept that probably didn't dawn on him during the recording of the Seeger-related tunes. The material's subject matter boils down to perseverance, faith and distrust in elected officials, themes that ran through his response to 9/11, "The Rising," an inspired balm that for many people helped clarify scrambled feelings.
When he performed at New Orleans' Jazz Fest in April, he saw a half-empty city in ruin that will require years to rebuild -- on Monday, he even noted that short attention spans need to be altered when it comes to keeping a focus on recovery. The city makes for an easy focal point for his audience: The Springsteen crowd is affluent, white and middle-aged -- people with fond memories of trips to the Big Easy, or at least a conscious images of what made the birthplace of blues and jazz so vital.
That focal point lent poignancy to the evening's final song, "When the Saints Go Marching In," a quality so desperately absent in the title track from the Seeger Sessions album, "We Shall Overcome." Both tunes open at a funereal pace and grow into epics, but "Saints," naturally, grew in the playfulness that runs in tandem with its hope for a better afterlife. "Overcome," meanwhile, never escaped its more powerful ghosts from the Civil Rights era, especially those cast by Seeger's rendition at Carnegie Hall in 1963. The song's power is derived from its intent: Springsteen and his audience of spectators have no motivation to make the spiritual transcendent.
Getting people to sing along with unfamiliar tunes -- Seeger, it should be pointed out, was a master -- can be a struggle, and Springsteen even joked that L.A. would be tougher than most other tour stops. His 17-piece band of horns, strings, voices, piano and acoustic guitars took up the slack, fleshing out songs with show-stopping ensemble bursts. About eight songs received the all-out treatment that drove home the energy associated with Springsteen in his E Street Band concerts.
And as much as it looks like an extemporaneous hootenanny, Springsteen has this show as plotted out as a Broadway act, leaving nothing to chance, whether it be the layering of sound or having the instrumentalists leave their perches and come downstage to solo.
The multitude of instrumentalists provided him with an enormous palette. He was ostensibly backed by a New Orleans jazz band, a bluegrass quintet, a barrelhouse blues trio, a gospel choir and a single accordion. Sometimes they took a romp together (the spirituals "Mary Don't You Weep" and "Jacob's Ladder), while elsewhere they let the song fit a single genre (a Kansas City swing-inspired version of "Open All Night"; the pure folk of "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize"; the anti-war jig "Mrs. McGrath").
Eleven of "The Seeger Session's" 13 tracks made it into the 2�-hour show. They were partnered with songs from 1980's "The River," 1983's "Nebraska" and a mediocre version of "If I Fall Behind" that paled next to the chill-inducing rendition heard on the first E Street Band reunion tour.
Set also included the Boss' rewrite of Blind Alfred Reed's Depression-era classic "How Can a Poor Man Stand Such Times and Live." (Vocal delivery was a direct lift from Ry Cooder's 1970 interp of the tune. It was the only time Monday the horns played with a sheen of rock-era modernism.)
Drawing on "The River" and "Nebraska" has its own inner logic: Those records were made at a time Springsteen was being turned on to books such as Woody Guthrie's "Bound for Glory" -- Guthrie and Seeger were traveling partners and bandmates -- and he started drawing on the old folkies' narrative style, universal messages and social responsibility in his own writing. That style is a connective tissue to the work of Seeger -- whose name was never mentioned during the show -- and the one that gave the fulfilling evening some of its greatest strength.
Springsteen and the band perform June 22 at Madison Square Garden.

The 1976 original, in which Gregory Peck  adopted Satan, was a mildly creepy, well-made, and well-acted shock fest with a hollow core. This remake, like the Antichrist at its center, is a whole lot like its daddy. Directed by John Moore  (who made the similarly great-looking but empty Behind Enemy Lines ), the film is simply too big for its britches. The cast (including Liev Schreiber  as an ambassador who secretly adopts the wrong baby, Julia Stiles  as his wife, and Mia Farrow  as Satan's wet nurse) is excellent, but the Hand of God is a lousy excuse for gaping plot holes. Still, for those looking for shocks, the cat scares and deaths are top-notch, including the best on-screen decapitation you may ever see. If the movie didn't take itself so seriously, it could have been a great popcorn muncher. As is, it'll still work fine for those willing to forgive its trespasses.
