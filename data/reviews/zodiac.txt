Fincher, the director of Se7en
, Fight Club
, and Panic Room
, switches gears with his new film Zodiac
 from psychological thrillers to something that more closely resembles a police procedural. Based on Robert Graysmith�s two books about the notorious Zodiac murders that gripped the San Francisco area in the early Seventies, Fincher�s film is nevertheless creepy and uncompromising. The public�s familiarity with the Zodiac�s cryptic, years-long murder spree during which the killer sent taunting letters and ciphers to the area newspapers before turning dormant, automatically turns the plot into a story with few surprises. Furthermore, it�s a crime story in which justice has never been served, making the film one that has no rectifying conclusion � a story arc that cuts against the established grain of Hollywood crime films. Instead, Fincher�s film places its primary focus on the four men whose lives were forever altered by their pursuit of the Zodiac�s identity: two homicide detectives David Toschi (Ruffalo) and William Armstrong (Edwards), San Francisco Chronicle
 crime reporter Paul Avery (Downey Jr. ), and the paper�s cartoonist Robert Graysmith (Gyllenhaal), who became obsessed with uncovering the Zodiac despite having no occupational duty to the story. By investigating the actions of these men, Zodiac
 becomes more a story about the task�s inherent frustrations and disappointments rather than an expos� of the serial murderer, although the re-creation of the Zodiac�s assaults are disturbingly lifelike nevertheless. As the case spans four jurisdictions, it becomes increasingly apparent that we are witnessing what complicated criminal investigations were like in the time before the electronic age of fax machines and centralized computer databases. Fincher uses dozens of period pop tunes to help set the period (the opening and closing use of Donovan�s �Hurdy Gurdy Man� is especially creepy) and the excellent DV camerawork by Harris Savides provides the film with a slightly faded appearance that is completely appropriate to the overall tone of the film. The casting couldn�t be better: Zodiac
�s panoply of performers all drip with the metaphorical perspiration of men hard at perplexing work. Yet Fincher�s character shorthand is also the film�s biggest problem. We know too little about the psychological makeup of these men to just accept the film�s easy conclusion that the Zodiac case ruined these men�s lives. It�s too simplistic to say that the situation destroyed Graysmith�s marriage when he�s already once-divorced when we first meet him or that Avery slipped irretrievably into his addictions when he�s already a big boozer at the outset. Neither is it sufficient to explain Graysmith�s obsession by merely mentioning that he�s an Eagle Scout and loves puzzles. At 2 1/2 hours, the film is also too long in the telling and too short on suspense. Certainly, it is the most fact-filled film version of the story, yet I�d argue that there are many incidents and characters that could be stripped without hurting the narrative � and, in fact, would improve the film�s tension and comprehensibility. Without due process or a culprit to wrap up the storyline, Zodiac
 needs a more solid center on which to hang its story.


"Zodiac" is as meticulous and absorbing as David Fincher's other thrillers. In "The Game, " "Fight Club, " and "Panic Room, " he placed a premium on painstaking craftsmanship that made them easy to get lost in. Even though none of those movies was as distinctly satisfying as his music videos, the sensibility seemed completely new. He was a pop artist and a mechanical engineer, and the movies were an impossible combination of the two: laborious fun.
But "Zodiac," based on James Vanderbilt's deftly structured screenplay, is a long work of completely sustained suspense and dark humor. The film reconstructs the still-unsolved, nearly 40-year-old case of the so-called Zodiac murders, which gripped the San Francisco Bay area in the late 1960s and early 1970s. It isn't concerned with the solution of the case so much as how the search for a solution undid the men trying to do the solving.
The hunt begins after the killer, who has been at large for several months, writes to the San Francisco Chronicle, demanding the editors publish his letter and the accompanying cryptogram. ( It's the first of several.) The editors hold long meetings over whether to run the puzzle and it's a heady kick watching anonymous, middle-aged white guys sitting around a conference room talking ethics in a Hollywood movie. The puzzle is printed, and, in a flurry of scenes, everyone from the CIA to a married couple in Salinas tries to decipher it.
This isn't Watergate but in many respects the movie feels like "All the President's Men." Here, our Woodward and Bernstein are actually a composite of problem-solver types. Robert Downey Jr. plays Paul Avery , one of the paper's more flamboyant staffers (those ascots, those vests, that facial topiary). Avery was a star crime reporter, and he seems as driven and self-involved as the famous Washington Post
 duo. But as the case leads nowhere (the bodies mount and weeks drag into years), the dead ends plunge him into a career-ruining drink-and-drug-fueled funk. Downey doesn't overplay the downward spiral as much as he's probably entitled to. It's a smartly delicate performance.
His co-worker at the Chronicle, the editorial cartoonist Robert Graysmith, is more durable. Graysmith, a divorced single dad, a word freak, and an Eagle Scout, is played by Jake Gyllenhaal. As the years roll by and the case goes uncracked, no one, not even the blind date (Chloë Sevigny) he eventually marries, bothers to tell the increasingly obsessed Gray-smith that there's no merit badge for sleuthing. (Graysmith wrote the book from which this movie was adapted; his subsequent book about the dead "Hogan's Heroes" star Bob Crane was turned into Paul Schrader's movie "Auto Focus." The Eagle Scout is into serious kink.)
Gyllenhaall, of course, doesn't suggest Graysmith is a fetishist. It's just all-consuming work. The actor's pop-eyed boyishness has never been better used. He's like a Hardy brother with no idea what his Scout's instincts have gotten him into.
Graysmith and Avery often butt heads with David Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), one of the detectives on the case. For a change, Ruffalo actually appears to be up to something. He's put a lot of air in his voice, but when he speaks, it's directly, without the actor's usual tics and stammers. In other words, it's believable that Ruffalo's cop could have shown Steve McQueen how to be a detective in "Bullitt," as Toschi did in real life.
Over 2 1/2 hours, the movie divides its time among the cartoonist, the reporter, the detectives, the killings, and the manhunt. Abetting the chase are a troupe of solid actors doing starchy law enforcement (Anthony Edwards, Elias Koteas, Dermot Mulroney, Donal Logue), some comic insinuation from the excellent character actor John Carroll Lynch, and a delicious performance from Brian Cox as the pompous King of Torts, Melvin Belli, who relishes the opportunity to talk to Zodiac on live television.
Breaks in the case come and go, and the years fall away. As big and wide as the movie's scope seems, "Zodiac" is actually pretty myopic. The time line stretches from 1969 to 1991, but we don't see or hear much about Vietnam, Watergate, disco, the Harvey Milk assassination, or the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Other than footage of the construction of the Transamerica Tower, it's all Zodiac all the time.
It's true that the inconclusiveness of the case keeps the movie from achieving any sort of finality. Even at 160-odd minutes, it feels incomplete, insofar as it has to acknowledge that it's pulled us across time only to shrug. Nonetheless, this is a stylistic turning point for the director. His typically grandiose filmmaking is introverted, patient, chillingly calm, and sure of itself. Every shot has the deep matte texture that good digital filmmaking provides. The inventive cinematographer Harris Savides uses breathtakingly wide angles and intelligent contrasts of shadow and light to create an intense painterliness. (The lonely nightlife in Edward Hopper works comes to mind.)
May everyone who plans on making "Saw 12" watch the gut-wrenching murder sequences in "Zodiac" and appreciate the astonishing, unalloyed clarity of the filmmaking. These same young directors were presumably also weaned on Fincher's "Se7en," that chicly apocalyptic serial killer flick that birthed a generation of amoral and visionless imitators. With that movie in mind, people were remaking filthy horror classics of the 1970s to resemble the fashionable distress of Fincher's thriller.
"Zodiac" is a kind of corrective remake of "Se7en," a renunciation of that earlier movie's psychotic nihilism. That rejection extends to a neat sight gag. Fincher gives us a shot of a cardboard cutout for "Dirty Harry" that mocks the personal abyss that catching Zodiac becomes. "He doesn't break cases," it reads. "He smashes them." The irony is piquantly funny. The Zodiac case smashes just about every man who tries to break it.


         A dozen years ago, with the disturbing, graphic serial killer procedural "Seven," David Fincher staked his claim as one of the more intriguing young American directors. Since then, his films — "The Game," "Fight Club" and "Panic Room" — have helped cement his reputation as a visually sophisticated stylist while dividing critics on their substance.
 
  So it comes as something of a surprise that Fincher's latest, "Zodiac," is primarily a complex character study, despite the film's grim and gruesome subject matter. It's a role reversal of sorts for a director who normally emphasizes the brutal tension in his movies.
 


         






    Written by James Vanderbilt based on Robert Graysmith's nonfiction book, the intelligent thriller delves into the compulsive effect that the Zodiac killer case had on the Bay Area police detectives and journalists investigating it.
 
  Overlong and lacking dramatic focus, the film nevertheless captures the dark allure that the unsolved crimes had on the region over a 22-year period. Taunting police with threatening letters and ciphers sent to newspapers, the Zodiac terrorized Northern California by claiming responsibility for 13 murders. Combing through 2,500 suspects, the multi-jurisdictional manhunt is fascinating in its minutia and the ways the men respond to the pressures of pursuing a madman.
 
  The Zodiac inspired at least half a dozen earlier movies — notably "Dirty Harry" — and serial killers in general tend to provoke filmmakers to action. Often, however, their stories tend to become jumping-off points for creating horror films. Vanderbilt and Fincher, on the other hand, are far more interested in the psychological elements, particularly the toll that reaches beyond the victims, although the story is sometimes overwhelmed by the vast amount of detail they shoehorn into the film.
 
  The filmmakers enhanced their characters mightily by assembling a top-drawer cast. Headed by Jake Gyllenhaal as Graysmith, the San Francisco Chronicle political cartoonist who would eventually become the primary author on the subject, Mark Ruffalo as lead San Francisco Police Department Inspector Dave Toschi and Robert Downey Jr. as Chronicle crime reporter Paul Avery, the actors get at the heart of what drove these men and the price they paid for their commitment.
 
  There are really two movies going on, the more pro forma detective story focusing on the police and a slightly goofy yarn involving the journalists.
 
  As Toschi — the alleged inspiration for the characters played by Steve McQueen in "Bullitt," Clint Eastwood in "Dirty Harry" and Michael Douglas in the television series "The Streets of San Francisco" — Ruffalo has one of his best roles since his breakout performance seven years ago in "You Can Count on Me." Toschi is cocky, witty and assertive, and Ruffalo expresses the weariness that comes from spending so many years on one case. Anthony Edwards plays his partner, Inspector Bill Armstrong, a man so worn down by the process that he eventually puts in for a transfer from homicide.
 
  In contrast to the cops is Gyllenhaal's Graysmith, whose enthusiasm for the case grows with time. Initially intrigued by the Zodiac's puzzles, Graysmith eventually becomes so obsessed that he's practically the only one still sifting through the evidence. Downey is electric as the glib, debauched Avery, whose bravado annoys the police and helps to reel in Graysmith.
 
  Among the rest of the large cast, Brian Cox is a standout as attorney Melvin Belli. Coincidentally, Philip Baker Hall, who plays a handwriting specialist, also starred in an independently made 2005 film, "The Zodiac," which told the story from the perspective of a Vallejo detective played by Justin Chambers of "Grey's Anatomy."
 
  Early on, Fincher re-creates the murders effectively enough in large set pieces, but they are oddly lacking in tension. Vanderbilt peppers the script with humor, but the suspense does not really kick in until it focuses on Graysmith as the protagonist in the film's second half.
 
  The final 45 minutes, when the film's primary characters come into harm's way, are by far the most chilling sequences. It could be that we simply don't have enough invested in the other characters to be frightened for them or it might be something more disturbing. Serial killers were once the most frightening criminals we could imagine, but now we live in a time when killers walk into schools and shopping malls with automatic weapons and the possibility exists that a suicide bomber might strike, claiming many victims. Could it be that a killer randomly picking off individuals and couples simply isn't as scary as it used to be?
 
 
  "Zodiac." MPAA rating: R for some strong killings, language, drug material and brief sexual images. Running time: 2 hour, 38 minutes. In general release.   

Explaining a mystery is an act of reassurance. It makes us feel that chaos has been defeated, and the forces of order restored. Zodiac , David Fincher's vastly intricate and dazzling drama about the hunt for the serial killer who terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area starting in 1969, offers no such soothing closure, and that's part of what's haunting about it. It spins your head in a new way, luring you into a vortex and then deeper still, fascinating us as much for what we don't know as what we do. Reenacting one of the most infamous ''cold'' cases in U.S. criminal history, Fincher has broken with the fanciful mode of tawdry baroque opulence he employed in Fight Club , Panic Room , and his first serial-killer outing, Seven . Zodiac  is based on piles of documents culled from police records, and it's been made in a style of dogged, almost fetishistic realism, its suspense rooted in the scrappiest tidbits of bureaucratic protocol. Fincher refuses to squeeze the hunt for the Zodiac killer into tidy arcs. The revelations occur where they did, and not where they didn't.
In this movie, it's the killer who imposes order on things. As we watch, two young people, parked on a lovers' lane, are assaulted by a stranger who pulls up in his Mustang, then fires a hail of bullets. Weeks later, a letter appears in the offices of the San Francisco Chronicle . It's a confession, written in blocky letters, with details only the killer would know, and signed with a logo that looks like a rifle sight; it also includes a page written in cipher code. Will cracking the code reveal the killer's identity? (A high school teacher soon solves it. Answer  no.) The Zodiac, as he christens himself, is a madman who promises to kill again, but his ruthlessness is surpassed by his ingenuity as a new kind of urban sociopathic media terrorist.
A procedural thriller for the information age, Zodiac  focuses on the complicated efforts by a handful of investigators to uncover his identity. There's the Chronicle 's star crime reporter, Paul Avery, played by Robert Downey Jr. as a talented drunken flake who mouths off to superiors in a way that reminds you what newspaper journalists were once like, and there's Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal), the paper's political cartoonist, who kibitzes on the case for no good reason except that he's a moody, hyper-curious lurker with a thing for puzzles. (The movie is based on two books by Graysmith.) There's Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo), a homicide inspector more earnest than inspired, and his low-key partner, William Armstrong (Anthony Edwards). Legally, the detectives have to coordinate almost every move with the surrounding districts (Napa, Vallejo), and the result is a communication tangle that's one of the movie's sly themes  the way that information gets lost in a bureaucratic state.
Re-creating the pre-tech grittiness of the '70s, Fincher doesn't just get the cars and Top 40 tunes right. He gets the smoke-clogged offices with their blinking telephones, the ugly wood paneling  and, more than that, the dawn of the tabloid age, when a serial killer could still set off shock waves. At times, we might be watching a film by Sidney Lumet in his high fluorescent period, or maybe the All the President's Men  of deranged homicide. We see most of the Zodiac's murders, and they are coldly horrific to behold (especially the stabbing of one couple by a lake), but the real story is the way that the killer uses the mass media to inflate the dark grandeur of his crimes. He  creates a myth of himself, like Jack the Ripper or Charles Manson, and once that myth takes on a life of its own, it's not even clear that the murders he's bragging about are all his. (There's no pattern to them.) The cops and reporters are looking for a killer, but they're also chasing a ghost.
Zodiac  never veers from its stoically gripping, police-blotter tone, yet it begins to take on the quality of a dream. It's an analogue of the post-9/11 world, where the enemy is specific yet, by virtue of his self-projection, omnipresent, and therefore impossible to pin down. As the '70s roll forward, the investigators move on to other cases, but Graysmith, the amateur, can't, and Gyllenhaal, who marinates his boyishness in quivery tension, makes that obsession ours. Slithering into police libraries, interviewing suspects, tearing his family life apart, he's eaten up by the need to know, and he makes connections no one else does, but does he solve the case? By the time he fastens on to a monster, maybe the  monster (and maybe not), Zodiac  leaves us haunted by the knowledge that he's looking for something that can't be found: a way to make the monsters go away.

 David Fincher’s magnificently obsessive new film,  “Zodiac,” tracks the story of the serial killer who left dead bodies up and down California in the 1960s and possibly the ’70s, and that of the men who tried to stop him. Set when the Age of Aquarius disappeared into the black hole of the Manson family murders, the film is at once sprawling and tightly constructed, opaque and meticulously detailed. It’s part police procedural, part monster movie, a funereal entertainment that is an unexpected repudiation of Mr. Fincher’s most famous movie, the serial-killer fiction “Seven,” as well as a testament to this cinematic savant’s gifts.  Informed by history and steeped in pulp fiction, “Zodiac” stars a trio of beauties — Jake Gyllenhaal, Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo — all at the top of their performance game and captured in out-of-sight high-definition digital by the cinematographer Harris Savides. Mr. Gyllenhaal is the sneaky star of the show as the real-life cartoonist turned writer Robert Graysmith, though he doesn’t emerge from the wings until fairly late, after the bodies and the investigations have cooled. A silky, seductive Mr. Downey plays Paul Avery, a showboating newspaper reporter who chased the killer in print, while Mr. Ruffalo struts his estimable stuff as Dave Toschi, the San Francisco police detective who taught Steve McQueen how to wear a gun in “Bullitt” and pursued Zodiac close to the ground.  The relative unknown James Vanderbilt wrote the jigsaw-puzzle screenplay, working from Mr. Graysmith’s exhaustive, exhausting true-crime accounts of the murders and their investigations, “Zodiac” and “Zodiac Unmasked.” Mr. Graysmith, coyly played by Mr. Gyllenhaal as something of an overgrown Hardy Boy, his great big eyes matched by his great big ambition, was a political cartoonist doodling Nixon noses at The San Francisco Chronicle when Zodiac started sending letters and ciphers to the paper, divulging intimate knowledge of the crimes. The first messages arrived in 1969, the year Zodiac shot one young couple and knifed another in separate Northern California counties before moving on to San Francisco, where he put a bullet in the head of a cabbie.  The first cipher stumped an alphabet soup of law enforcement agencies, including the C.I.A. and F.B.I., but was cracked by a California schoolteacher and his wife. The decoded cipher opened with an ominous and crudely effective flourish: “I like killing people because it is so much fun it is more fun than killing wild game in the forrest because man is the most dangeroue anamal.”  The letters, the misspellings and the lax punctuation kept coming, and perhaps so did the murders, though only five were substantively linked to him. A publicity hound, Zodiac claimed responsibility for murders he might not have committed, a habit that added to a boogeyman mystery and myth that chroniclers of his crimes, including Mr. Graysmith, have exploited.  Mr. Fincher made his name with “Seven,” a thriller in which the grotesquely mutilated bodies of murder victims are nothing more than lovingly designed props. Although more than capable of adding to the exploitation annals, he is up to something profoundly different in this film, which opens with the shooting of two people parked on a lovers’ lane at night, an attack that is soon followed by a squirmingly visceral knife assault on a couple during a daytime idyll. By front-loading the violence, Mr. Fincher instantly makes it clear just what kind of murderer this was — one who liked to get his hands wet — and ensures that the murders don’t become the story’s payoff, our reward for all the time stamps, geographic shifts, narrative complication and frustrated action.  The story structure is as intricate as the storytelling is seamless, with multiple time-and-place interludes neatly slotted into two distinct sections. The first largely concerns the murders and the investigations; the second, far shorter one involves Graysmith’s transformation of the murders and the investigations into a narrative. With its nicotine browns, the first section, which opens in 1969 and continues through the mid-’70s, looks as if it had been art-directed by a roomful of chain smokers. Dark and moody, like all of Mr. Fincher’s work, this part has been drained of almost all bright colors, save for splashes of yellow, the color of safety and caution, and an alarming-looking blue elixir called an Aqua Velva that is Graysmith’s bar drink of choice.  The second, more vibrantly hued section begins with Graysmith sitting in the Chronicle newsroom, its yellow pillars now painted blue. He looks as bright and bushy-tailed as the day he read Zodiac’s first letter, though now he comes equipped with three kids and a wife (an unfortunately familiar scold whom Chloë Sevigny imbues with some welcome wit). But there are demons still loose, inside and out, which is why Graysmith takes on Zodiac alone, warming up the stone-cold case. Domestic tranquillity, it seems, can’t hold a candle to work, to the fanatical pursuit of meaning and self-discovery, to finding out what makes you and the world tick — which is why, while “Zodiac” contains multitudes (genres, jokes, nods at 1970s New Hollywood), it feels like Mr. Fincher’s most personal film to date.  Maybe that’s why it doesn’t have the usual movie-made shrink- rapping and beard-stroking, as in Mommy was a castrating shrew and Daddy used a two-by-four as a paddle. Throughout the film Mr. Fincher and company keep focus on Zodiac’s crimes, on the nuts and bolts of his deeds, rather than on the nurture and nature behind them. There is no normalizing psychology here, and no deep-dish symbolism either, maybe because the title crazy is so peculiarly fond of symbols, which he sprinkles in his missives and, for one murder, wears superhero style on a black-hooded costume that makes him look like a portly ninja in a Z-movie quickie. It’s no wonder the victims don’t see the threat behind the masquerade until it’s too late.  Psychology isn’t Mr. Fincher’s bag; he isn’t interested in what lies and writhes beneath, but what is right there: the visible evidence. And what beautiful evidence it is. His polished technique can leave you slack-jawed, as can his scrupulous attention to detail: the peeling walls of a derelict building in “Fight Club,” the rows of ant-size letters marching across the pages of a composition notebook in “Seven,” the bruises splashed across a woman’s arm in “Zodiac.” There is mystery in this minutiae, not just virtuosity, and maybe, to judge from reports of his painstaking process, a touch of madness. Like his detectives and journalists, Mr. Fincher seems possessed by the need to recreate reality — to revisit the scene of the crime — piece by piece.  There’s a moment early in the film when Mr. Downey stands in the Chronicle newsroom, back arched and rear gently hoisted, affecting a posture that calls to mind Gene Kelly done up as a Toulouse-Lautrec jockey in “An American in Paris.” Avery has already started his long slip-slide into boozy oblivion, abetted by toots of coke, but as he strides around the newsroom, motored by talent and self-regard, he is the guy everybody else wants to be or wants to have. Like Mr. Ruffalo’s detective, who leaves everything bobbing in his rapid wake, Mr. Downey fills the screen with life that, by its very nature, is a rebuke to the death drive embodied by the Zodiac killer. Rarely has a film with so much blood on its hands seemed so insistently alive.  “Zodiac” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains extremely graphic gun and knife violence, as well as alcohol abuse and cocaine use.
In the unforgettable Zodiac , three shots stand out. The first comes early, climaxing a brisk introduction to one of the film's primary settings, the offices of the San Francisco Chronicle . Gliding through hallways with the suavity you'd expect from the director, David Fincher , and the cinematographer, Harris Savides , the camera assumes the point of view of an object inside an overflowing mail cart. It is August 1, 1969. The first of many letters and cryptograms by a serial killer calling himself the Zodiac has been delivered to the newspaper.
The second shot, captured by helicopter or perhaps digitally composited, is an aerial view of a taxi motoring through San Francisco. Starting at the intersection of Mason and Geary, the God's-eye-view follows the vehicle to the corner of Washington and Cherry, at which point the passenger, the Zodiac, shoots the driver, Paul Stein . Patterned with a series of space-collapsing dissolves, the sequence is scored to disembodied voices on a talk radio program discussing the manthe media phenomenonthat has gripped the city in fear and fascination.
The third, arriving about halfway through the film, literalizes the theme of the first two, and indeed of Zodiac  itself: the relationship of man to media. Several years have passed; the body count has mounted; the letters have piled up. The efforts of Homicide Inspector Dave Toschi  (Mark Ruffalo ) and his partner William Armstrong  (Anthony Edwards ) have failed to turn up a suspect. A tracking shot follows them through the offices of the San Francisco Police Department, the other nexus of the film. The image is layered with a digital scrawl of letters, phrases, and symbols from the Zodiac missives, literally engulfing the heroes in a text that has thus far led nowhere.
Thus far: There is much more to come. With a runtime of over two and a half hours, this relentlessly swift film super-charges every minute with a maximum of minutiae. Dizzyingly dense, intricate in the extreme, Zodiac  is the most information-packed procedural since JFK , though far more restrained when it comes to theorizing. The screenplay, meticulously engineered by James Vanderbilt , has been adapted from a pair of books by Robert Graysmith  (played here by Jake Gyllenhaal ), a cartoonist at the Chronicle who glommed on to the Zodiac case and eventually took it on as his life's work. Everything has been checked against verifiable sources, then staged with the utmost fidelity and precision; note how Fincher resists dramatizing the events in Paul Stein's cab, sticking to a representation of his known route. The result is an orgy of empiricism, a monumental geek fest of fact-checking, speculation, deduction, code breaking, note taking, forensics, graphology, fingerprint analysis, warrant wrangling, witness testimony, phone calls, news reports. "I felt like I was stuck in a filing cabinet for three hours," complained one viewer. Exactly!
A remarkable feat of concentration, Zodiac  is a fully mature triumph for reasons that bring us back to that trio of signature shots. Their explicit virtuosity stands out in a surface that forgoes the visual sweep of Seven , Fight Club , or Panic Room . Mechanical as he can be, Fincher tends to the operatic: big emotions, massive denouements, portentousness, flamboyance. Zodiac , by contrast, plays out with the cool calibrations of a 12-tone piano suite, advancing with a detached, mathematical precision capable of great variety and nuance, yet controlled by a strict discipline. It's a film that never raises its voice because it needs to speak clearly and carefully. It's got a hell of a lot to say.
Talk to Fincher and he'll tell you he just wanted to tell a damn good story. Mission accomplished. Yet it's his very lack of pretense, coupled with a determination to get the facts down with maximum economy and objectivity, that gives Zodiac its hard, bright integrity. As a crime saga, newspaper drama, and period piece, it works just fine. As an allegory of life in the information age, it blew my mind.
The medium is the message in Zodiac . That's what those three shots mean, and why they're delivered with extra rhetorical emphasis; the Zodiac is never given an attention-grabbing p.o.v. shot, but his communiqué is. A serial-killer flick that isn't really about a serial killer, a procedural keyed to the psychology of procedure  more than the men engaged in it, Zodiac  is an information system of bewildering complexity laid out for our contemplation. It's an epic, reflective analysis of how one canny lunatic triggered an all-consuming flood of data that swept up, and drowned, three different entities: the media, the police, and one man's life. Zodiac  returns the serial-killer flick to its roots in Fritz Lang 's M , a movie likewise preoccupied with technology, symbols, spatial patterns, communication systems.
Anyone expecting a reprise of Seven- style shivers and Grand Guignol psychodrama will be gravely disappointed. Yet common to both films is the notion of their villains as the inevitable manifestation of a troubled zeitgeist. Seven 's John Doe seeks to chastise the debased, apathetic modern world through a kind of radical installation/performance art; an appreciative audience, shocked at his subversive daring, is an essential component of his project. His provocation is basically an extremely twisted publicity stunt. "We are talking about people who are mentally ill," protests Brad Pitt 's wrathful hothead. "We are talking about people who are fucking crazy." "No, no we are not," replies Morgan Freeman 's world-weary detective. "We're talking about everyday life here."
