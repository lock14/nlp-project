         Bill Resler, an exuberant University of Washington tax law professor turned girls' high school basketball coach, would have been a good subject for a documentary all on his own. That a 14-year-old phenom named Darnellia Russell walked into his gym one day is one of those fortuitous twists that makes for a terrific documentary.
 
  This veritable deus ex machina
 may have fallen into the lap of writer-director Ward Serrill, whose film "The Heart of the Game" tells the story of Resler and Russell, but he has certainly made the most of it. More than seven years ago, Serrill set out to film Resler's maiden season as girls' basketball coach at Seattle's Roosevelt High School, fully confident that there was a story there. Little did he know what authentic drama awaited.
 


         






    Resler had unorthodox theories about basketball, and coaching at the school where his three daughters attended allowed him to put these theories into practice. For one, Resler threw out the concept of a set offense, preferring to have his players improvise. On defense, the team would execute a full-court press for the entire game, requiring a level of fitness seldom found in high school players of either gender and the grueling training regimen it would demand. Most unusual of all was Resler's approach to motivating his players.
 
  After a brief prelude, the film picks up with Resler introducing the players to his ideas. A genial bear of a man, he cajoles and extols in equal measure. With drills that emphasize physicality and aggressiveness, Resler quickly disabuses his young ladies of any notion they can't play as hard-nosed a game as the boys.
 
  Soon, the Roosevelt team is living up to its nickname — the Rough Riders — crashing the boards for rebounds and diving for loose balls. Resler establishes a metaphoric theme for each season, empowering his charges to behave like a pride of lions or a wolf pack, and not simply beat their opponents but attack and devour them.
 
  The team becomes a powerhouse, regularly going to the Washington state playoffs, only to suffer crushing losses each year before reaching the title game. Serrill's camera gamely follows the first three seasons, efficiently recording the team's transformation and — with the exception of star player Devon Crosby-Helms — embrace of Resler's philosophy.
 
  Everything changes with the arrival of Darnellia Russell for season four, however. An African American student who lives in cross-town rival Garfield's region, Russell enrolls at predominantly white Roosevelt, where her mother hopes she will have better opportunities. Darnellia adapts well to Roosevelt's style of play but struggles socially and academically. By her junior year, the talented point guard and team leader is already getting letters from Division I college programs in bulk and is a key component of the Rough Riders' success — though a state championship remains elusive.
 
  An unforeseen event derails Darnellia's career and tests the resolve of everyone involved. The nail-biting final third of the film features legal battles, the raising of questions about racial and gender equality and outstanding basketball that significantly elevate the film's stakes.
 
  To say more would dilute the inherent drama as it teeters on the brink of tragedy with surprises that would challenge credibility in a fiction film. An exhilarating story of loyalty and perseverance, "The Heart of the Game" succeeds as both inspiration and social commentary.

''Draw blood!'' coach Bill Resler orders his Roughriders, the varsity basketball squad from Seattle's upper-middle-class Roosevelt High School. And they do. They are the ''pack of wolves'' he tells them to be. Then they're a ''tropical storm,'' a ''pride of lions.'' The scorched-earth metaphors (as effective as they are hokey) rotate faster than the bench over the seven savage seasons covered in the pulse-racing docu-rah-rah The Heart of the Game , but Resler's kill-or-be-killed philosophy remains as fixed as the pupils of a hungry predator. Why does a coach's stoking of adolescent bloodlust feel thrilling here, as opposed to, well, a little scary? Frankly, because these are girls, not boys. So might the same techniques routinely blamed for turning young males into raging, entitled pack animals actually convert self-doubting high school females into proud, sisterly she-wolves?
When such interesting questions aren't answered (or even articulated), one wishes Heart  used its head a little more. But filmmaker Ward Serrill is not a social scientist. He's a gifted sports photographer, and from the moment inner-city wonder girl Darnellia Russell enters the picture  becoming the reluctant star of both the (mostly white) team and the movie  Serrill is just as  invested in the girls' success as they are. On these terms, the film is a furious full-court press, its subjects aflame with the kind of passion only youth can furnish. Even their bruises are luminous.

 The hoop dreams of the teenage girls in the documentary "The Heart of the Game" are fairly straightforward if a wee bit intense. These high school students don't simply want to dribble, pass and shoot their way to another basketball victory; they want to kill. "I live for the hunt," says one player excitedly to the camera, all but vibrating out of her seat and ponytail. Anyone who still thinks girls are made of sugar and spice and everything nice should just try and block this chick, who fiercely embodies the spirit of her team name, the Roughriders,  on the court and off.  "The Heart of the Game" was made by Ward Serrill, a former executive at a Seattle public affairs firm, who several years ago was lucky enough to meet a genuine eccentric named William M. Resler, who repeatedly coached the Roughriders from Seattle's Roosevelt High School to victory. Married with three adult daughters, Mr. Resler has a day job at the University of Washington Business School, where he is a senior lecturer in accounting. At the university's Web site you can find a photograph of the bearded, white-haired professor next to the following declaration: "My philosophy toward teaching, tax law or life in general is the same. Struggle to fashion each day to be superior to yesterday. Work hard, play hard and avoid confusing the two." With some hair dye, Paul Giamatti could play him in the Hollywood remake.  Mr. Serrill's pro forma approach to his material makes it easy to imagine such a remake. For the most part, "The Heart of the Game" unfolds according to the sports-movie playbook: through love and bullying, a tough-talking, softhearted coach guides his team to its championship season. The cheerleaders cheer as the crowd roars and Mr. Serrill's low-end video camera dutifully tracks the action for seven years. The big difference here is that these players don't just face bad calls and lousy plays; they also come smack up against the gender divide. One girl is preyed on by a sexual predator while another becomes pregnant, triggering some obtuse institutional sexism. It's no wonder that for all its rough and tumble, the basketball court seems like the safest place in the world.  Part of what makes it seem so safe is Mr. Resler, whose unorthodox approach to basketball can be seen on the court — where everyone on the team "runs like hell" — and heard in his vivid language. Perhaps because he spends his working hours eyeball-deep in numbers, he has a richly developed sense of metaphor. He encourages the girls to think of themselves as wolves, exhorting them to: "Sink your teeth into their necks! Draw blood!"  The girls echo his war cries, though it must be said their rivals never seem especially rattled. This, in turn, has no effect on Mr. Resler, who also encourages the Roughriders to break their opponents "like a stick" and, at one point in the film, cheerfully switches his animalistic imagery from snarling wolves to swirling piranhas.  Although Mr. Serrill tries to turn one of the Roughriders, the formidably talented Darnellia Russell, into the titular center of his story, the strategy never takes. An underprivileged black girl who helped lead her mostly white, middle-class school to the state finals, Ms. Russell is a prodigy on the court and has all the makings of a classic sports hero. But while she's a terrific player, slipping around opponents like quicksilver, she never becomes a vibrant film character, even in the midst of her most dramatic hour. Despite Mr. Serrill's overtures and sympathetic attention, she eludes his grasp, particularly when compared with  Mr. Resler, who turns out to be not only the heart of this particular game, but also its brains, lungs and unforgettably endearing mug.  "The Heart of the Game" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film touches on sexual abuse and teenage pregnancy, but leaves out the expected, graphic details.

As the first pickup by new Miramax prexy Daniel Battsek, "The Heart of the Game" doubtless will generate interest and invite scrutiny by industry observers. It remains to be seen, however, how much must-see vibe the pic can muster among mainstream moviegoers, or even arthouse habitues. Comparisons to "Hoop Dreams," favorable and otherwise, are hard to resist. But disappointing B.O. returns by other recent, well-crafted sports docs ("The Year of the Yao," "Go Tigers!") portend an uphill struggle for Ward Serrill's compelling but traditional feature about an inspiring coach and femme basketball players at a Seattle high school. Prospects may be brighter in homevid playoffs.
Filmed over seven years, the pic devotes most screen time to Bill Resler, a gregarious U. of Washington tax professor with an abiding interest in sports. Despite his admitted lack of experience, he jumps at the chance to moonlight as coach for the girls basketball team -- the Roughriders -- at Roosevelt High School. Very quickly, he turns the perennial losers into tournament contenders, driving the team to play as relentlessly (and intimidatingly) as males.
Resler -- whose slight resemblance to Santa Claus becomes more pronounced as he ages during the pic -- often seems a comical figure while he exhorts his gangly femme hoopsters to "Sink your teeth in their necks! Draw blood!" But the girls take him seriously. "Heart of the Game" scores some telling points while tweaking gender stereotypes, playfully provoking thought while seriously suggesting that dunking and dribbling can be important steps toward self-empowerment.
Helmer Serrill gives only passing interest to most Roughrider players, few of whom emerge as distinct individuals. Still, the pic effectively and concisely renders the tragic story of an ace player who makes the mistake of hooking up with an exploitative private coach.
Docu's second half gradually attains the shape and suspense of artfully designed drama as the focus expands to include Darnellia Russell, an extraordinarily gifted player who's one of the few African-Americans on largely white team. The daughter of a cash-strapped inner-city family, Darnellia views basketball as her best chance for a college scholarship and, beyond that, a better life.
Unfortunately, her quick temper and self-destructive behavior prove major impediments, even with Resler's unflagging support. Serrill makes the most of the real-life drama involving Darnellia's legal battle to remain an eligible player after her schooling is interrupted by an unplanned pregnancy.
By paying so much attention to Darnellia's story, "Heart of the Game" inevitably gives short shrift to a potentially more interesting angle: the rivalry between Resler, basically a savvy amateur, and Joyce Walker, a former Olympian and Harlem Globetrotter, who takes the job as girls' basketball coach for Roosevelt High's cross-town rival. Still, the climax of Darnellia's legal struggle provides a satisfying emotional rush.
Hi-def lensing and other tech values are first-rate.

Ward Serrill set out to make a short documentary about the girls' basketball team at Roosevelt High School  in Seattleand especially its coach, Bill Resler, a tax professor with no experience. But a season later, the filmmaker encountered Darnellia Russell , who wound up the star of the team and the star of a movie bound up not just in the X s and O s of winning, but the politics of race, gender, and class. The Heart of the Game  is a sweet, engaging journey with the Roosevelt Roughriders, whose kindly coach encourages the girls to snarl like wolves and devour like lions. The movie has its bleak moments but aspires to inspire and uplift; you revel in the moment when the girls discuss their reluctance to touch each other on the court, and in their eventual love for the pushing and shoving of hardwood war.
