If you like Maxim
, you will love The Island
. It is glossy. It is expensive. It has lots of slick ads for Aquafina and Cadillac. It�s full of beautiful people in tracksuits and Pumas, and it takes an interesting young actress (Johansson) and transforms her into a talking blow-up doll with platinum-blond extensions and Lip Venom. It sort of purports to be about something thought-provoking (human cloning), so you don�t feel totally humiliated buying it; this is only the finest Hollywood cheese, a carefully aged Parmigiano Reggiano from the DreamWorks vault. Not sold yet? Here comes the closer: Shit blows up real good

 look like a couple of kids on tricycles riding down Avenue H. Oh yeah, we�ve got flying motorcycles! Take that! Seemingly intent to prove that he can out-Bruckheimer his former mentor and producer, director Bay pumps each scene up with so much adrenaline your logical mind will be totally unable to process the dystopic story, which would be interesting if Bay weren�t flinging the camera around hyperactively in every single shot. One virtual-reality fight scene is full of so many cuts and tilts that for all we know Bea Arthur could be on the soundstage roundhousing Estelle Getty. Bay can�t even shoot a plain old exterior establishing shot without zooming and whirling around dramatically.

 of the cash register weren�t faintly audible through the Sturm und Drang of Steve Jablonsky�s wall-to-wall score of ominous choral voices and tom-toms of war. It�s the kind of movie where a semi-truck driver doesn�t even check his rear-view mirror when 15 SUVs explode behind him, but the story still insists on its own intelligence and philosophical nature. If you think about it too much, you might start to feel like one of the cloned human beings in McGregor�s underground laboratory: force-fed, confined, and constantly distracted with bright shiny things to keep you from asking the essential question: "Why am I here?"


Michael Bay's frequently thrilling, completely bananas demolition derby, ''The Island," has Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson playing unreasonably attractive clones who are shocked to learn they've been hatched in a lab.
Among the 
downsides to being pod people are that intimacy is a no-no, they have no sex drive, and their wardrobe consists only of snug-fitting black-and-white track suits and Puma sneakers.
Everybody in this utopia looks like a personal trainer at the George Lucas Stormtrooper gym. The upshot is that if you win the daily lottery, you get to stop toiling in the film's ultra-sanitary sets and retire to the Island, a tropical white-sand paradise, where, presumably, Ricardo Montalban and Herve Villechaize await.
Of course the premise of this movie, which is set in middle of the 21st century, is that the Island isn't remotely what the clones populating the Merrick Biotech plant have been led to believe. Indeed, when one elated lottery winner, a football star played by Michael Clarke Duncan, discovers his true, ghastly destination, he freaks out and tries to escape. Witnessing this ugly and eye-opening event is a clone named Lincoln Six Echo, played by McGregor in, ironically, one of his most warmly human modes.
Lincoln has been more curious about his sterile environment than his fellow drones. His questions worry the facility's director/shrink/sexy evil genius, Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean), who's even had to warn security to issue ''proximity alerts" whenever Lincoln gets near Johansson's Jordan Two Delta. Jordan is the woman for whom Lincoln has intense and therefore illegal feelings. When the lottery turns up her name, Lincoln rescues her from potential horrors, and together they flee the facility and experience the real world -- well, OK, Los Angeles. The place looks a lot like Detroit and is teeming with flying cars and mass-transit trains suspended high enough to make potential stops in the smog.
In this altered La-La land, the clones try to find their human counterparts and complain to them about the lab's inhuman treatment. Their search entails evading police and the bounty hunters (led by Djimon Hounsou) whom Merrick has hired to nab his ''products" and return them. This inspires a 90-minute spree of jaw-dropping near-death adventures that send McGregor and Johansson dangling off skyscrapers, plummeting many stories in large metallic props, and participating in a particularly exhilarating highway sequence, the brute force of which won't be topped anytime soon. Needless to say, it's much more exciting than anything happening in Merrick's lab.
Jordan Two Delta has a tough time believing she's a real clone until she sees herself, tellingly enough, in a Calvin Klein ad, the very ones Johansson has actually starred in. The clone's owner is called Sarah Jordan, which appears to be the movie's way of approximating ''Scarlett Johansson." When Lincoln meets his owner, things get even more enjoyably in-jokey.
Johansson's skin gets more beautifully milky with each sequence, and I'm pleased to report that, having ditched the tracksuit, she accomplishes her stunts sporting low-slung jeans, pointy black boots, and a French manicure. This is the sort of perplexing ridiculousness that is among Bay's specialties. In his last movie, ''Bad Boys II," he orchestrated a sequence in which a Hummer destroyed an entire Cuban ghetto. Prior to that, he managed to flatten one of the most harrowing chapters of World War II into a corny comic strip called ''Pearl Harbor."
But Bay's strength as a filmmaker, the reason his superficial yet entertaining productions can never be completely ignored, is that he appears to lack shame. He'll blow anything up and run anybody over. The moral complexities don't matter to him. He just wants to stage spectacles, appreciate very good-looking people, and assert his cowboy aesthetic.
This brings Bay close to his cinematic forebear, Leni Riefenstahl, the auteur who made movies under the Third Reich and had a blind spot in moral matters, while ensuring that her interest in staged order and physical perfection neatly aligned with her fascist backers' interests in self-promotion. Bay's lust for choreographed mayhem is the opposite of Riefenstahl's affinity for control. In both cases, there isn't a lot of room for ideas to blossom.
The movie, whose script is credited to Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, and Caspian Tredwell-Owen, musters only a passing disdain for the perils of cloning, while the false promise of the Island stirs an eerie Holocaust metaphor. But the social and moral questions are merely springboards for Bay to play action-pornographer. When nothing is being hurtled or detonated (as is the case with the first 40 minutes of ''The Island"), his movies are inert. Human beings make vague impressions on Bay -- Steve Buscemi, who's very funny in a brief role as a worker at the cloning plant, is someone the director seems to like. Otherwise, people aren't people to Bay unless they're being flung toward the screen.
In places, ''The Island" makes overtures to the totalitarianism in Stanley Kubrick's ''A Clockwork Orange." And it bears more than a passing resemblance to ''Logan's Run," that 1976 sci-fi adventure about a man and a woman who flee Elysian climes to avoid being killed on their 30th birthdays. More often though, ''The Island" often feels like a series of epic television commercials that leave you wanting to buy something expensive, ridiculous, and unnecessary -- like a copy of yourself.


         Be careful what you wish for, it might ruin the movie you're in. Lincoln Six-Echo and Jordan Two-Delta are cloistered clones desperate to breathe the sweet air of freedom. But once they make good on their escape, "The Island" collapses like a punctured balloon.
 
  Of course, given that "The Island" is directed by world-class noisemaker Michael Bay, make that a very loud punctured balloon. Chases, crashes and explosions are thick on the land in the second half of this movie, but though they are expertly done, their size, frequency and increasing disconnection from what was once a coherent story leave you feeling pummeled rather than exhilarated.
 


         






    While the premise of "The Island" (as conceived by original screenwriter Caspian Tredwell-Owen) is not exactly revolutionary, it is a sturdy one, strengthened through multiple usage. And as it plays out, in the first half at least, it is surprisingly suited to Bay's talents.
 
  The time is the year 2019, safely in the future. Lincoln (Ewan McGregor), Jordan (Scarlett Johansson) and their fellow residents of a massive underground facility run by Merrick (the impeccably evil Sean Bean) think they are the only survivors of a devastating planet-wide catastrophe. They live only to win the lottery, a periodic drawing whose winner gets to leave the facility and go to the Island, "the world's last paradise." They believe all this, but they are wrong.
 
  Because Bay is by nature a heartless director, he turns out to be well suited to presenting this controlled, antiseptic future world — heavily influenced by "THX 1138," "The Matrix" and other films — in a believable way. With the help of production designer Nigel Phelps and cinematographer Mauro Fiore, "The Island" creates a fascinating futuristic cityscape and gives time and thought to making the regimented way its residents live science-fiction convincing.
 
  If you're a cold filmmaker, it helps to have warm actors, and McGregor and Johansson do nicely as innocents in a world where the mantra is "be polite, pleasant and peaceful" and residents get "proximity warnings" if they spend too much time with members of the opposite sex. Also amusing is Bay veteran Steve Buscemi, a behind-the-scenes guy who knows more than he lets on.
 
  Naturally, Lincoln and Jordan soon enough discover the truth about their facility and have to deal with the fact that, to paraphrase George Orwell, some humans are more human than others. They naturally want to escape, but though we wish them the best, once they get out of town the movie leaves with them.
 
  Merrick, mirthless evildoer that he is, doesn't take their departure lying down. He hires the equally unsmiling former mercenary Laurent (Djimon Hounsou) to track Lincoln and Jordan down, no questions asked, no expense spared, no regard for human life necessary ... you get the idea.
 
  Though there are some nice futuristic touches in the cityscape of the Los Angeles that Lincoln and Jordan flee to, at this point "The Island" effectively jettisons everything that made it at least marginally interesting and degenerates into a fearsome chase movie where Bay and company get to play with all the toys, including expensive automobile prototypes and flying motorcycles called Wasps, a $120-million budget could tolerate.
 
  With a budget like that, it goes without saying that the stunts are superbly executed, but they are so ceaseless, finally so about themselves rather than furthering the story in any meaningful way, they become exhausting more than anything else.
 
  It doesn't help that Bay has a weakness for torturing his characters as well as the audience and that co-screenwriters Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci, who news reports say were brought in to work on the film's final sections, are not strong on dramatic plausibility. "The Island" was never going to be great, but it deserved to be better than it ended up.

In the future, according to the gobbledygook prospectus offered by the sci-fi/action thriller The Island , human clones known as agnates will be bred as insurance policies for rich people with millions available to spend per genetic duplicate pop. That way, if something unfortunate happens to Mr. or Ms. Moneybags  a defective liver, a bum ticker  he or she will be able to harvest what's needed from the made-to-order backup and discard the rest. This is, of course, a terrible thing to do to an innocent agnate  who is a human being, after all, no matter how unromantic the biological conception or how oblivious the specimen to his or her purpose and fate on earth. Hath not a clone eyes? If you prick him, doth he not bleed through his sleek white Logan's Run  jumpsuit?
But all is not so forlorn in the near-futuristic scenario governed by director Michael Bay. While scientists are raising replicants in the images of humans as comely as Ewan McGregor and Scarlett Johansson (it's a little joke that she plays a clone of a model, har!) and indoctrinating them with the myth that they are the very special, sole survivors of a fatally contaminated universe, happy non-agnate children in the outside world still enjoy BEN & JERRY'S ice cream. Efficient, non-agnate adults can take advantage of the latest technological breakthroughs from MICROSOFT and NOKIA. And best of all, at least for lovers of stuff that blows up and kills people, there's piles of it, going boom in SONY DIGITAL DYNAMIC SOUND (in selected theaters).
Are there really lovers of stuff that blows up and kills people anymore? Which is to say, are there any who actively look forward to a Michael Bay movie, in which vehicles race each other into oblivion, humans fight one another to death, destruction is wholesale, and no camera shot is held for more than three seconds? Are there moviegoers who are so satisfied with the stringing together of special-effects explosions (including, of course, the composite shot of a body hurled through fiery space) that they think, ''Dang, that's what I call entertainment''? Or are we all just...lab rats, conditioned to think that this is what a big, American action picture looks like? Maybe we're the agnates and Bay occupies the role played by Sean Bean, that of a nefarious genius of biogenetic engineering who has turned human complacency into big business?
I digress; time to adjust the serotonin levels. It's agnates Lincoln Six-Echo (McGregor) and Jordan Two-Delta (Johansson) we're meant to care about, out of all the others in the spandex brigade, although screenwriters Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman, and Roberto Orci sure don't make the empathy easy. Lincoln's a feisty one, full of beans and a few too many strands of wild-card DNA that are causing flare-ups of disturbing ''memories'' and bad behavior; he's a potential troublemaker, and while McGregor is allowed to stir and prowl in the first third of the movie (his discovery of the truth about agnate existence is a tingly moment of horror), he's quickly relegated, in the other two-thirds, to oafish ejaculations of ''Go!'' and ''Run!'' and ''Hold on!'' Jordan, on the other hand, is simply a generic lump of cells, with which Johansson can do little, wise-child eyes and all. When Lincoln urges Jordan to escape Agnateville with him, explaining that the contamination-free island holiday they've been promised is a hoax, or when a corporate security detail (headed by an ill-used Djimon Hounsou) comes after the two escapees, she responds like a  well, like a model posing for a cosmetics ad.
The Island  is not without good questions (How far are you willing to go to protect your own good health? What does the phrase ''taking a dump in the can'' suggest to someone who has never heard it before?) and even a few molecules of wit that pass like aberrations. With the appearance of Steve Buscemi, for instance, as a scraggly antiauthoritarian human worker at the clone house who befriends Lincoln at his peril, the script takes an incongruous detour toward playfulness. And Lincoln's third-act encounter with his own progenitor is a tasty bit of high-concept fun for McGregor.
And then, boom! And ''Look out!'' The Island  begins with a whimper of interest as a cool-hued, cautionary exploration of the ethics of cloning, and ends, in a hail of product placement, with a dumb bang.

 "The Island" is the kind of movie almost entirely devoted to the explanation of its own premise. This takes some time, because the premise is complicated. But since the explainer is Michael Bay, the exposition is carried out on the run, and you have a lot of flashy images to look at while you're connecting the dots.  Really, the picture consists of two semi-familiar science-fiction conceits nestled one inside the other. At first, after Ewan McGregor wakes up from a Calvin Klein perfume commercial of a dream in a sterile white room full of talking gadgetry, you might take this for a dystopian, "Brave New World"-inspired vision of a totalitarian future. It sure looks that way, like an update of "THX 1138," with product placements for Puma sneakers and Aquafina bottled water. Everyone wears white and travels through a hushed, shopping-mall environment, where every mood and movement is monitored and regulated. For their own good, of course. These people are survivors of an environmental catastrophe and are quarantined until they are chosen, one by one in a lottery, for a trip to the island, which is the only uncontaminated spot left on the planet.  Lincoln Six Echo (Mr. McGregor)  starts to ask some questions and, with the help of McCord (Steve Buscemi), a large moth and his own curiosity, discovers that he is not in a post-apocalyptic totalitarian science-fiction fantasy at all but in another kind altogether.  "There is no island," he breathlessly tells his friend Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), as they prepare to flee. "Trust me."  And what choice do we have? We've paid our money to see a picture called "The Island" (which begins with a picture of a really nice-looking island), and now they tell us that there is no island. So we trust Mr. Bay and his several screenwriters to tell us what, exactly, there is.  I don't want to give too much away - at least no more than the trailers already have, which is most of it - but the science-fiction movie our hero and heroine turn out to be in has to do with unbridled technology and corporate irresponsibility. Their controlled, tranquil environment is not a refuge but a factory - or perhaps a warehouse - and they, along with their white-jumpsuit-wearing friends, are the products. They are the unknowing clones of rich people, having been bred by a greedy, ambitious scientist named Merrick (Sean Bean) to be harvested for spare parts. The lottery that pretends to select them for the island is actually their appointment for slaughter.  These days, every self-respecting summer blockbuster must also be an allegory, usually with a vague connection to President Bush and 9/11. "The Island" sends its symbolic feelers out in a different and perhaps even more contentious direction. The issues raised by the possibility of human cloning are vexed in themselves, and they are also connected to more immediate debates about abortion, stem cells and euthanasia. These debates are quite pointedly invoked - in ways that cut sharply against the assumption that Hollywood is a liberal propaganda factory - whenever the question of Lincoln and Jordan's humanity is raised. According to Merrick, they cannot be human since they exist as the result of a purely utilitarian process and "have no souls."  Yes, but they do have the most beguiling matched set of blue eyes. And Mr. Bay, in any case, is not exactly what you would call a humanist. Death on a large scale - whether in "Pearl Harbor" or "Armageddon" - does not really trouble him, as long as there are some spectacular explosions and whiplash-inducing car chases. Which there certainly are in "The Island," once it busts out of the clone tank to zoom across the Arizona desert into the streets of futuristic downtown Los Angeles (played, curiously enough, by the special-effects-enhanced present-day city of Detroit).  Along the way, as Lincoln and Jordan flee a heavily armed bounty hunter (Djimon Hounsou) and his minions, Mr. Bay treats us to some of his signature set pieces, including a freeway chase in which giant metal train wheels roll from the back of a fast-moving truck into speeding traffic. (He did something like this in "Bad Boys II," but with embalmed corpses instead of train wheels. By the way, it turns out that in the future, rail travel on Amtrak will enjoy something of a renaissance, and L.A. will have a high-speed, skyscraper-level public transit system.) Apart from the explanatory cross-talk and the occasional flight of philosophical speculation, the dialogue is mostly breathless imperatives. "Run!" "Watch out!" "Go!"  And by all means do, if you're in the mood for glossy, witty eye candy with some moderately chewy stuff in the middle. This lavish, exhaustingly kinetic film is smarter than you might expect, and at the same time dumber than it could be. It's an impressive product: a triumph of cloning that almost convinces you that it possesses a soul.  "The Island" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has intense action sequences, some of them bloody, and a few sexual situations.

"The Island" is no paradise. In his latest exercise in sensory overkill, producer-helmer Michael Bay takes on the weighty moral conundrums of human cloning, resolving them in a storm of bullets, car chases and more explosions than you can shake a syringe at. Frenetic actioner about refugees from a genetic cloning plant starts off intriguingly, burns up its ideas in the first hour and pads out the rest with joltingly repetitive action sequences. Given Bay's built-in, mostly male audience, DreamWorks and Warner Bros. look to harvest decent if not spectacular opening returns, though specimen's long-term viability is far less assured.
It's the year 2019, and Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor) is one of several hundred survivors of a cataclysm that left the whole world contaminated, save one place -- the eponymous Island. This lush retreat, Lincoln and the other refugees are promised, will one day be their home. For now, they're kept in a lavish but sterile research facility, where authorities force them to wear identifying wrist bracelets; their moods, diet and metabolism are carefully monitored; and male-female "proximity" is strictly forbidden.
Suspicious by nature and prone to prophetic nightmares, Lincoln finds his worst fears confirmed after Starkweather (Michael Clarke Duncan), selected by random lottery to go to the Island, instead winds up on a slab. When his friend and burgeoning love interest, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson), is the next one to win the lottery, Lincoln grabs her and together they stage a jailbreak. Alarmed by the breach, sinister mastermind Dr. Merrick (Sean Bean, adding another to his gallery of villains) hires a mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) to hunt them down.
One of the small charms of "The Island" is that its test-tube protags, far from being hardened heroes, are a pair of brainwashed innocents, sealed off from the outside world and generally lacking in social smarts. McGregor exploits this most winningly, affecting an earnest gee-whiz streak and speaking his lines in a boyish, slightly higher register. 
Faring not so well is Johansson, usually the subtlest of actresses, who in her first major action role has been encouraged to make a shrill, bombastic spectacle of her character's cluelessness.
Another downside of Lincoln and Jordan's ignorance is that by the time they realize what's up -- that they're walking "insurance policies," raised only to supply organs for their genetically identical owners -- auds will have long since figured everything out.
While the essentially surprise-free narrative plays catch-up, there's little to do but sit back and admire Nigel Phelps' gleaming production design; the biotech facility, in particular, suggests a cross between a day spa, a spaceship and a maximum-security prison. Yet even here, Bay's direction zips along at such an unmodulated rush, so eager to get on with the next set-piece or expository line of dialogue, that auds will have precious little time to soak up the images, much less allow their potentially troubling implications to deepen and resonate.
Setting and premise conjure countless visual and thematic echoes from other films, including "The Matrix," with its paranoid dystopian vision and roomful of sticky birth-pods, and even "The Truman Show," with its 24-hour surveillance cameras and megalomaniacal controller. One scene, featuring an army of mechanized, eye-scanning spiders, is lifted straight out of the more convincingly futuristic "Minority Report."
The references feel thoroughly secondhand; Bay ultimately is interested in the science and ethics of cloning only insofar as they provide a backdrop for all the vehicular chaos he's set to unleash. (Ancillary moral: Clones are human, too.) 
In terms of spectacle, pic is a pileup of kinetic mayhem, as Lincoln and Jordan's first actions in the real world include dodging bullets, destroying several police cars and crashing a hovercraft into a skyscraper. 
Yet for all the vertiginous camera movements and ace visual effects, the action remains tension-free and largely incoherent, thanks to attention-deficit editing by Paul Rubell and Christian Wagner.
Scribes Caspian Tredwell-Owen, Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci save their best lines for the superbly snarky Steve Buscemi, as a facility staffer who comes to the clones' aid (and has a priceless exchange with "Ghost World" co-star Johansson in the process). And pic has sly fun with Lincoln's and Jordan's "owners"; former is played by McGregor in an effective second role, while latter is glimpsed in Johansson's real-life Calvin Klein ad. Other product placements, particularly by Aquafina, are too numerous to mention.

Anyone who has ever endured the brute skull crunch of a Michael Bay  movie will find that The Island , the director's stab at icy, dystopian sci-fi, is virtually an art film by comparison. For almost a full hour, the narrative endeavors to withhold information and even smuggles in high-toned references to Stanley Kubrick  and Shirley Jackson . There are no undermotivated explosions; shots last for seconds at a time. By the frat-metal standards of Bad Boys, The Rock , and Armageddon , the pace is downright Tarkovskian. The perhaps deliberate effect of this unusual temperance is that you can't wait for Bay to start blowing shit up.
In the post-apocalyptic year 2019, Ewan McGregor  and Scarlett Johansson  are the hottest inhabitants of a regimented colony that, with its retro-future hyperdesign and newfangled smart drinks, has the oppressive vibe not of a supermax facility but of a boutique hotel in the meatpacking district. Residents wear fetching white bodysuits reminiscent of '60s'70s sci-fi and the house rules are derived from early-21st-century reality TV: The winner of a weekly lottery is transported to the Island, "Earth's last remaining pathogen-free zone."
But as even the trailer reveals, and as should be instantly apparent from the presence of Sean Bean  as a doctor with a God complex (poor Steve Buscemi  is left to diagnose the condition: "It's called a God complex"), there is no Island and there was no viral disaster. The sealed-off outpost houses clones who are being harvested for organ donations and have been implanted with fake memoriesin this near future, millionaires have the option of purchasing their very own genetic replicants as spare-parts insurance policies. As a cautionary scenario, it's hardly original but it has bottomless resonance: Adopting a sidelong approach to a similar premise, Kazuo Ishiguro 's recent novel Never Let Me Go  is a marvel of sneaky understatement, occluded details and ominous euphemisms adding up to a wrenching investigation of what it means to be human, to be conscious of mortality. But for Bay, restraint means not dropping a fireball on a large urban center within the first act. In a blockbuster season freighted with grim allegory, The Island  seems especially dim and literal minded. It recognizes a certain hot-button relevance in its subject, but can't get beyond thumbs-up/thumbs-down assessments: clones good, science bad. (If someone were to gently point out that the science was responsible for the clones, you suspect the movie would self-destruct.)
When the stars escape into the outside world, Bay himself seems liberated. (From start to finish, though, he fulfills his product placement duties like a pro: The Island , like Minority Report , envisions the future as an ad-saturated consumer paradise; the brazen prominence of the brand names seeks to put the act of selling in quotes, except it doesn't.) As for the chases and shoot-outs, suffice to say the virtuosic clumsiness of Bay's action style, simultaneously lumbering and kinetic, reaches a new apotheosis in The Island 's best sequence. I can't remember why exactly, but at one point McGregor and Johansson are zipping down a freeway on a big rig, tossing giant metal spools into traffic, percussive dents serving as rhythm section on the concussive soundtrack. This is pure essence of Bayit's big, it's loud, it has no context, and if you show up tanked, I'm sure it's really quite poetic.
