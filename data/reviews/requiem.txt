 Like “The Exorcism of Emily Rose,” the 2005 film directed by Scott Derrickson and starring Laura Linney and Tom Wilkinson, “Requiem” is loosely based on the real-life story of a West German woman who died in 1976 after a series of failed exorcisms.  But while the earlier film was a histrionic, effects-laden court battle between the secular and the spiritual, Hans-Christian Schmid’s thoughtful drama is content to explore a single question: Why would an intelligent young woman, experiencing terrifying seizures, willingly choose exorcism over medical intervention?  Working from a script by Bernd Lange, Mr. Schmid traces the mental decline of 21-year-old Michaela (a devastating Sandra Hüller), a devout college freshman already on medication for epilepsy. Exchanging the religious constraints of her small-town home for an easygoing campus dorm, Michaela acquires a boyfriend (Nicholas Reinke), a best friend (Anna Blomeier) and a social life. But a stressful combination of circumstances — including first-time sex, a pathologically critical mother (Imogen Kogge) and the strain of concealing her illness — causes her seizures to return, accompanied by voices and hallucinations.  Desperate, Michaela turns to the Roman Catholic Church, only to be caught between dueling clerical opinions. And though her father (Burghart Klaussner) is loving, his faith in science is no match for a wife who finds demonic possession easier to acknowledge than mental illness.  Balancing Ms. Hüller’s astonishingly physical performance with an intimate, naturalistic style, “Requiem” is a moving study of a tortured young woman more at peace with medieval ritual than with modern medicine. Throughout, Mr. Schmid remains agnostic, suggesting that Michaela’s problems, whatever their origin, prove only that a mind in torment is a terrible thing.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

A troubled college student in 1970s Germany is subjected to an exorcism in taut, F/X-free drama "Requeim." Built around an extraordinary, lacerating, Silver Bear-winning leading perf by stage actress Sandra Hueller, this stunningly played story of faith vs. family, sold as a character piece rather than the genre thrill ride it most definitely isn't, could segue to arthouses following strong word of mouth.
Though she has suffered for years from what's been diagnosed as epilepsy, Michaela Klinger (Hueller) is determined to study education at the university. With the blessings of father Burghart (Karl Klingler) and in spite the of disapproval of mother Marianne (Imogen Kogge), she takes up residence in a dormitory and hits the books.
Nothing in her devoutly Catholic background has prepared her for the freedoms or pressures of school. In short order she befriends moody but loyal Hanna (Anna Blomeier), and begins a hesitant yet seemingly sincere relationship with chemistry student Stefan (Nicholas Reinke).
It's only when she goes off her meds that trouble starts. She claims to hear voices and see things, and is instructed by these apparitions not to touch her rosary or a crucifix. Her parents and friends want to support her, but seem either helpless or dismissive; even kindly Father Landauer (Walter Schmidinger) scoffs at the idea there could be demons in her head.
Coming to believe she's being made to suffer in the manner of a favorite saint, she's at first shocked, then violently angry when earnest young pastor Borchert (Jens Harzer) organizes a living-room exorcism.
Helmer Hans-Christian Schmid has excelled in drawing strong perfs from young thesps in such films as "23" and "Crazy." Good as those are, "Requiem" resonates with deeper, more complex layers of meaning. Far more interested in the subtle real-world causes of Michaela's breakdown than any spiritual or supernatural presence, Schmid, who does not believe in demonic possession, along with scripter Bernd Lange, make no judgments about her condition; she could be working too hard to please her family or, perhaps, she could be possessed by the devil.
Relying on nothing beyond raw emotion and physical contortions, Heuller's profoundly troubled Michaela, with her elastic features and increasingly helpless agitation, announces the actress as a major new talent. Other perfs are pro, led by Klaussner and Kogge as parents with widely differing methods for coping with an ill child.
Tech package is quietly rich, with Bogumil Godfrejow's widescreen lensing and Christian M. Goldbeck's unobtrusive production design lending a tangible docu air to proceedings.
As with Schmid's previous film, hailed ensembler "Distant Lights," there's no music score. With their organ-heavy hard rock, Deep Purple's "Anthem," Amon Duul's "Paramechanical World" and a few other period tunes create a mood at once secularly chilling and religiously resonant. Pic is the first production from Schmid's new 23/5 shingle and opens domestically in March.
Story was inspired by the same 1976 events dramatized in the recent "The Exorcism of Emily Rose."

Using the same factual basis that inspired the recent courtroom shocker The Exorcism of Emily Rose  , this quietly unnerving psychological study from German director Hans-Christian Schmid  wields its ambiguity about religion and science like a double-edged blade. Freely adapting the story of Anneliese Michel , a 23-year-old German student who died in 1976 after a grueling exorcism, Schmid and screenwriter Bernd Lange  imagine the girl (here called Michaela) as more Carrie White  than Regan MacNeil an epileptic, sexually blossoming seeker whose fits seem logical (and understandable) as explosive tantrums at her repressive religious upbringing. But Sandra Hüller , a young German stage actress making a harrowing feature debut, invests Michaela's terrified, possibly schizophrenic outbursts with unholy conviction: When she claws toward a crucifix in mortal terror, the devil's handiwork no longer seems a remote possibility. Or maybe it's more appealing than the alternatives: a god who would allow such suffering as a test of divine allegianceor no god at all, just the mind and its endless capacity for self-torture.
