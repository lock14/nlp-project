The characters in Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda's beautifully unnerving films often exist somewhere between reality and memory. The four abandoned siblings in his piercing drama Nobody Knows  are very much flesh and blood, but because they keep to themselves, fashioning a parentless routine while hiding in their increasingly dire Tokyo apartment from other adults who might break up the family, the children become rather ghostlike themselves. When their irresponsible sprite of a mother (one-named Japanese pop phenom YOU) disappears with yet another man and as the money she has left runs out, first the electricity goes, then the water, and then the food. But however horrifying the conditions  all the more shocking for being based on a true story out of a society that prides itself on propriety  there is nothing pathetic about the kids, or accusatory in the telling. Rather, Hirokazu finds a gentle and cumulatively mesmerizing way to convey the connection among the children, and to admire the society they build  slowly (Nobody Knows  is confidently, unapologetically long) and through close observation of the physical world.
Most of the responsibility falls to the oldest son, Akira (Yagira Yuya), a 12-year-old boy forced into a paternal role when he himself has been cheated of a reliable father. Akira forages, cooks, defends, and experiences his own first crush on a neighborhood girl  and Yagira's performance is so extraordinary, it won him the best actor prize at the 2004 Cannes film festival.

irokazu Kore-eda's "Nobody Knows," a harrowing, tender film, was inspired by a real event known in Japan as "the affair of the four abandoned children of Nishi-Sugamo." The facts of the case, which achieved some notoriety in 1988, suggest the kind of story you might follow, with a mixture of prurience, revulsion and moralism, on Court TV or in a tabloid newspaper. Four children - three of them without birth records, all of them the offspring of different fathers - were left alone by their mother in a small Tokyo apartment, where they lived for six months without attracting any notice or intervention. Their tale is a rich, awful congeries of primal and distinctly modern fears, from the universal childhood fantasy of parental abandonment to the more grown-up suspicion that big cities are places of cruel isolation and indifference. Mr. Kore-eda explores nearly every emotional nuance and implication of the story, without for an instant succumbing to sensationalism or melodrama. The content of "Nobody Knows," which should consolidate his reputation as one of Japan's most interesting and original filmmakers, is inherently upsetting, and watching the film is, to some extent, a punishing immersion in impotent dread. In observing the helplessness of the four children, you become acutely aware of your own inability to do anything for them.  Mr. Kore-eda's camera is so close to them - navigating the narrow, cramped spaces of their home, zooming in on their faces, hands and feet - that the sense of their aloneness becomes overwhelming. You are in on the secret of their existence and prevented from communicating it. But because the movie also sticks closely to the children's point of view - and in particular to the experience of Akira (Yuya Yagira), the oldest of the four and the one left in charge by his mother (You) - it also offers a measure of relief. Akira, his two sisters, Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura) and Yuki (Momoko Shimizu), and their irrepressible (and perhaps mildly retarded) younger brother, Shigeru (Hiei Kimura), are not quite aware of the horrific implications of their plight. They are, after all, accustomed to living with a childlike, erratic parent, who is capable of being funny and generous as well as neglectful. In the early scenes, their life with her has an adventurous, mischievous quality; the two smaller children are smuggled into the new apartment in suitcases, so their existence can be kept secret from the landlord. And some of the spirit of fairy-tale adventure remains even after the mother has vanished, the money she left behind has dwindled and Akira's steadfastness has begun to fray into desperation. In reality, the idea of children fending for themselves is terrifying, but that terror is also what gives so many bedtime stories and young-adult novels their thrill. Children's literature, from the Brothers Grimm to "The Secret Garden" to Lemony Snicket, is heavily populated by foundlings, orphans and cast-off children whose pluck and resourcefulness feed fantasies of heroic self-sufficiency. "Nobody Knows" is of course too naturalistic, and too disturbing, to be a movie for children, but it nonetheless engages the audience's wondering, childlike imagination as well as its worrying adult conscience. Though the responsibility of caring for his siblings weighs heavily on Akira, he does not entirely lose his capacity for fun and spontaneity. He also takes it upon himself to protect the younger ones, giving them gifts and holiday presents that he pretends are from their mother and keeping them supplied with playthings and treats when his meager budget allows. Mr. Yagira was 12 when he began work on the film and 14 when he won the top acting prize in Cannes last year, beating out Tom Hanks, Geoffrey Rush and Gael Garc�a Bernal, among others. His performance is the key to the film's uncanny ability to capture the world of childhood from both inside and out; Akira is, of necessity, mature beyond his years, but also frighteningly unworldly, and Mr. Yagira, without the self-consciousness that young actors so often lean on, allows glimpses of the boy's complicated inner life to come through in small gestures and fleeting expressions. "Nobody Knows" is not for the faint of heart, though it has no scenes of overt violence, and barely a tear is shed. It is also strangely thrilling, not only because of the quiet assurance of Mr. Kore-eda's direction, but also because of his alert, humane sense of sympathy. He is neither an optimist nor a sentimentalist - like his previous films, "Maborosi," "After Life" and "Distance," this one presents a fairly bleak view of the modern world - but he does keep an eye out for manifestations of decency, bravery and solidarity. These tend to be small and fleeting, and therefore all the more valuable and worth clinging to when his patient, meticulous eye uncovers them. "Nobody Knows" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some upsetting scenes.
Maven of the pensive in-between, Hirokazu Kore-eda has landed firmly on earth as we know it since the high-concept metaphysics of 1998's After Life . His 2001 Distance  (shown in the U.S. only at the San Francisco Film Festival) patiently surveyed the numbing bruises left by the Aum Shinrikyo  sarin incident, and his new film, Nobody Knows , explores the context and minutiae of a mundane urban news item. The 1988 "Affair of the Four Abandoned Children of Nishi-Sugamo" reads like a typically scary page out of the Post : Four young and undocumented siblings were left by their mother to live alone in a Tokyo apartment for six months, until one of them, weakened by malnutrition, was accidentally killed. Shades of Kitty Genovese , the scandal that resonated in Japan  was not so much the mother's abandonment as the fact that no one in the building realized what was going on or cared to notice that the three youngest children even existed.
The brood's vivacious mother (You), cursed with a warbling sine-wave vocal pitch that sounds like Cyndi Lauper  impersonating an alley cat, arrives at a new apartment with only a 12-year-old son, Akira (Yuya Yagira, a winner at Cannes ), and mountains of heavy luggagefrom which emerge, once the door is locked and the shades are drawn, the other kids. Ten-year-old Kyoko (Ayu Kitaura) is a budding teenage girl silently yearning for a normal life, seven-year-old Shigeru (Hiei Kimura ) a rambunctious lost boy, five-year-old Yuki (Momoko Shimizu ) an oblivious cherub living out her own ad hoc preschool playtime. The rules, as Mom delineates them in game-playing fashion, are: no school, no leaving home, stay out of sight, stay quiet. A full three-quarters of Nobody Knows , which was shot in chronological order over the better part of a year, is set in this penny-ante two-room flat, and Kore-eda's intimate, ultra-realist visual scheme makes the ordinary textures and unfiltered city daylight bounce off the screen. (His attention to quotidian soundYuki's fiddling with crayons, sayborders on the ultrasonic.)
The movie's repetition and stasis are integral to its thrust; Kore-eda never provides relief from the children's ingrown perspective. Only Akira can visit the streets and shop, and his trips into Tokyo are framed for maximum contrast, powerful images of a diminutive stranger in a strange land of tumultuous opportunity and harrowing self-exposure. Of course, as the money Mom left begins to run out, life in the apartment commences a devolution. Kore-eda sticks to the story's facts pretty closely, but obviously let circumstances and his cast create their own crisis in the making, complete with impromptu poetic touches. At one point in the quiet dissipation, Yuki convinces Akira to escort her out into the nightened city to find her mother, the tot shuffling along in slippers that squeak with every step. It's a heart-sundering vision of preadolescent helplessness that rivals passages of Landscape in the Mist  and Ponette .
Nobody Knows  could've hit more targets with fewer arrows, given a little more care. The soundtrack's ukulele music cues are a trifle automatic and obvious, the close-ups (Kyoko's angrily peeled, Mom-applied nail polish) can be unnecessary exclamation points, and the general ambience is oddly anesthetizedAkira and his charges are frustratingly inexpressive. Still, it's hard to resist the maddening disappearance of Akira's last coininto a pay phone as he waits on holdor the final train ride, with suitcases. Calling it an "issue" film ignores that fact that movies concerned with the fragile reality of childhood are as precious as one-pound pearls.
