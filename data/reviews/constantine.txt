Woe unto John Constantine. Born with the ability to perceive both the diabolic and beatific creatures that walk among us and the attendant inability to keep his mouth shut, he was thought mad and sent to an asylum, where, in despair, he attempted suicide. Clinically dead for two minutes, he was afforded a glimpse of the hell awaiting those who commit Catholicism�s most mortal of sins and promptly straightened up and flew right. That was 15 years ago. Now, as played by Keanu Reeves, the Los Angeles-based Constantine polices the borders between heaven and hell, deporting wayward demons from the earthly plane in the fragile hope that he might buy his way back into God�s good graces and thus avoid the blistering hell that awaits the former suicide. Whoa, indeed. Adapted from Alan Moore�s groundbreaking DC/Vertigo comic title, Constantine
 is sure to divide the series� most rabid fans � most noticeably, the character is no longer a blond-haired, post-punk Brit modeled on Sting � but those who can set aside their preconceptions will discover one of the more artfully designed comic-based films in some time. Moore, famously, had his name pulled from the finished product in protest over what he viewed as unpardonable sins against his storyline, but for all its divergences from Moore�s sacrosanct text, Constantine
 the movie is remarkably faithful to the book�s grim tone. This is not the Marvel Universe, where Spider-Man triumphs and things are Fantastic. Constantine may hobnob with the angel Gabriel (Swinton, in a breathtakingly outr� performance) and consort with the damned (among them Bush frontman Rossdale), but he�s also a cynical and hard-drinking nicotine fiend who�s just learned he has terminal lung cancer. With precious little time left to him, on this plane at least, he can hear Lucifer�s tread behind him and he�s getting anxious about that one-way ticket. Sulfur�s in the air, though, and as more and more Hell-spawn begin to make incursions onto the Earthly plane, Constantine hooks up with a similarly-gifted LAPD detective (Weisz) whose recently deceased sister may hold the key to an impending Luciferian blitzkrieg. Constantine
 will likely hold far more interest for devoted fans of the series, but it�s not necessary to have read the books to appreciate the film�s sumptuous visuals and art direction � courtesy of production designer Naomi Shohan and art director David Lazan � which range from a genuinely awe-inspiring vision of a hell in the perpetual grip of a nuclear blast to a �neutral� heaven �n� hell dive bar overseen by Hounsou�s voudoun
 Midnite. As always, the devil�s in the details and Constantine
 is loaded to the tip of its pointy tail with splendid little flourishes and a sense of pacing that lets the surreal events mount slowly and with ever-increasing gravitas. The big question, of course, is Reeves himself. With his black trenchcoat and jaded, doom-centric mien, he pulls it off, capturing, however improbably, the sheer, soulless exhaustion of a man who has nothing left to lose and everything to gain. Of course, he�s no longer playing in punk rock band Mucous Membrane, as Alan Moore would have it, but all in all it�s a fair trade-off. This Constantine
 has far more important things to do.


One thing's clear: R.J. Reynolds won't be showing "Constantine" at the company picnic any time soon.
As John Constantine, a film noir-style demon fighter who has been to hell and back before the movie even begins, Keanu Reeves puffs cigarettes the way some people pop Altoids, one after the other. He's paying the price for it, too: In an early scene, a doctor looks at an X-ray of the hero's ruined lungs and gives him six months to live. Actually, this is good news to Constantine. He tried suicide years before, but it didn't take.
"Constantine" is the latest example of the New Corporate Medievalism, that strain of millennial entertainment that takes the mopey nihilism of goth culture, fuses it with our current interest in angels and demons and other diversions from the business at hand, and serves it up with as many computer generated beasties as can fit on a screen. The movie has been adapted from "Hellblazer," a comic book -- excuse me, graphic novel -- that has been around in various forms since 1985, when celebrated comics writer Alan Moore came up with the character of John Constantine in an issue of "Swamp Thing."
Diehard fans of the comic -- sorry, graphic novel -- will probably be angry about the changes wrought here; for one thing, the setting is no longer London but Los Angeles, presumably so music-video director Francis Lawrence (making his feature debut) can stay close to his studio handlers. It could have been worse, though. The weather in this LA is actually rainier than in London, and "Constantine" is a lot better than "Van Helsing" and more professional than the "Blade" movies, if not quite as much fun as "Hellboy." Like all of them, it smacks faintly of bread and circuses, but at least you get your money's worth in CGI-overstim.
And it gives our man Keanu something to do other than sit around wondering why "The Matrix" series went south. Dressed in back-to-Bogart basics -- black suit, white shirt, loosened tie -- Constantine is called to a dingy apartment to exorcise Something Icky trying to escape from the body of a young Mexican girl. A little later he deals with a whirligig hellspawn, made of millions of beetles, that tries to mow him down on Figueroa Street. Then there are the bats that aren't really bats, flying nasties that Constantine dispels with a vial of flaming dragon's breath provided him by Beeman (Max Baker), the Q to his Bond. All in a day's work.
Something isn't right, though. Demons are supposed to stay inside the humans they possess, not clamber out to see the sights. "We're finger puppets to them, not doorways," says Chas (Shia LeBoeuf), the hero's teenage apprentice and driver. According to the film's potted cosmology -- part Catholicism, part Aleister Crowley, part stoned dorm-room heavy-metal riff -- only the Halfbreeds can walk among us. These are humans with red glowing eyes and good grooming who hang out at nightclubs. Metrosexuals, in other words. Chief among them is Balthazar, a viperish dandy portrayed with brio by ex-Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale. If you're a winged archangel you can visit Earth, too, which explains Gabriel, dressed in a pin-stripe suit and played by Tilda Swinton with the mad certainty of General George Armstrong Custer.
The busy plot involves the Spear of Destiny -- the weapon used by the Romans to kill Christ on the cross, don't you know -- and an attempt by the legions of Satan to gain entrance to our world through one of two psychic twin sisters, both played grimly by Rachel Weisz. One sister barely makes it past the opening credits; the other is a police detective who becomes Constantine's constant companion and something like a romantic interest. But, really, when the gates of hell are opening, it's not the best time for a date.
Also briefly glimpsed are Djimon Hounsou as Papa Midnight, a spectral barkeep in a pork-pie hat; Pruitt Taylor Vince as a priest who attempts to drink an entire liquor store; and, at the end, Beelzebub himself, played by Peter Stormare (the man who threw Steve Buscemi in the wood-chipper in "Fargo") as a decaying Las Vegas emcee who has a personal knowledge of every sin on earth.
Mostly, though, "Constantine" alternates between quiet, surprisingly dull scenes in which the hero and the girl talk in that italicized comic-book way about his past and orgies of computer pixels dressed up as gibbering fiends. The Soldier Demons in particular look like Gollum's bigger, badder, brainless brothers.
Reeves is made up to look like Death warmed over -- literally -- and he bites off a few choice one-liners. Sadly, though, the movie's idea of wit is an upraised middle finger rather than an upturned line of dialogue, and that leaves one of our most curious movie stars in the lurch. I've always thought of Reeves as our generation's answer to Gregory Peck: darkly handsome, earnestly stiff, and possessed with a spark of self-aware humor that saves his performances time and again. But he's moving into his 40s now and still slaying make-believe monsters at an age when Peck was fighting small-town racists in "To Kill a Mockingbird." You tell me: Which villain's more dangerous, really?


         In "Constantine," Keanu Reeves plays a kind of INS agent on the border between this mortal coil and the eternal hereafter. Part detective, part border cop, part exorcist, John Constantine (no relation to the emperor who secured the power of the Christian church in the Roman Empire) spends his days extracting demons from little girls and making quick jaunts to hell.
 
  According to the movie's dogma, heaven, hell and Earth coexist on parallel planes, so crossing over takes a fraction of the time it would take to cross town at rush hour. All Constantine has to do is kill himself for a second and he'll wake up in exactly the same room, on the same street corner or on the same devilish stretch of the 101 Freeway where he was standing at the time — except the atmosphere will be on fire, and demons with hollow skull cavities will be darting around ripping new arrivals to pieces. Heaven, meanwhile, we learn toward the end of the movie, looks exactly like downtown on a weekend morning after a good rain, which struck me as a missed opportunity. Why not Malibu full of brainy angels greenlighting good movies?
 


         






    Not that "Constantine," based on D.C. Comics' "Hellblazer," doesn't have more than its share of gloomy pleasures, especially for fans of Dan Brown and the occult. For one thing, it's loaded with more cool Christian iconography than a souvenir stand at Lourdes. And Keanu Reeves has no peer when it comes to playing these sort of messianic roles — he infuses them with a Zen blankness and serenity that somehow gets him through even the unlikeliest scenes with a quiet, unassuming dignity. Another actor might panic and resort to bombast in an attempt to detract attention from glaring holes in the logic; he might start running around yelling things like "Where is she?!" in a demanding tone of voice. Not Reeves, though. He lets the illogic flow through him without resisting it. He is
 the illogic.
 
  A psychic brooder with an eye for spotting illegal hellions roaming the worldly plane, Constantine is one of the few humans hip to the U.S.-Soviet style détente between the blithe superpowers God and Satan, who have agreed not to have direct contact with the secular world but to stock it with half-human, half-angel/demon "influence-peddlers" instead. Now in the final stages of lung cancer and barred from heaven because of a teen suicide attempt, Constantine is working overtime to change the admissions policy, but the archangel Gabriel (Tilda Swinton) won't budge. Lately, though, he's noticed hell has been breaking loose its inmates, and he's eager enough to get on God's good side to look into it, especially after detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) — a tough-but-sexy loner cop in a tank top, whose twin just performed an assisted swan dive off the roof of the psych ward — insists. Then they're off to save the world.
 
  Weisz doesn't share Reeve's gift for affectless heroism — not that the deadly intensity of her character is entirely her fault. Saddled with the unfortunate burden of playing the 21st century damsel in distress (you know the type — tough, single, lives alone, carries a gun) she spends half the movie trying to look poker faced in a wet white tank top. Aside from Angela, Constantine has assembled a nice psychic friends' network for himself. There's Hennessy (Pruitt Taylor Vince), the psychic, alcoholic priest with the lazy eye; Midnite (Djimon Hounsou), former demon hunter turned club owner; and acolyte, Chaz (Shia LaBeouf), who's not psychic but who reads up on all the latest trends in Catholic arcana and "Da Vinci Code"-style doctrinal conspiracy theories.
 
  The first scenes are spare and powerful. In one, a poor Mexican laborer discovers a dagger wrapped in a Nazi flag under a ruined Church. The dagger is the Spear of Destiny, which the movie suggests is the weapon that killed Jesus. It's also the weapon that turns the laborer into an indestructible force of evil, possibly the son of the devil, because instantly he's surviving a horrific accident, stealing a car and entering California illegally. In another, a shameless homage to "The Exorcist," a nice-looking Christian lady in L.A.'s Chinatown makes herself a pot of tea while in the next room her preadolescent daughter scuttles around the walls like a soft-shelled crab until Constantine arrives to give her the Linda Blair treatment.
 
  But the movie gets bogged down around the time that Constantine and Angela start developing feelings for each other and she starts getting soaked with alarming frequency.
 
  It will shock nobody to learn that director Francis Lawrence previously enjoyed a career directing music videos, especially once the special effects and music video tropes threaten to take over. If there's one thing the world never needs to see again, it's an underground nightclub scene where the hipster damned go to see and be seen. Not that anyone expects one's occult thriller to be anything less than Byzantine, but despite some witty special effects and a appealing concept, "Constantine" meanders in too many directions to make much sense even to itself. The "demonic images" that earned its R rating consist of a porridge of mixed metaphors.
 
  Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale), a sort of half-demon lobbyist from hell, dresses like a stockbroker and hangs out in a conference room where he plays what could be a karaoke video for a John Ashcroft song — soaring eagles and rippling flags in an endless loop. As Satan, Peter Stormare dresses up like John Travolta circa 1977 and plays the part for giggles. By the time it's revealed that the sudden influx of hell nationals into the world was facilitated by a very big cheese in celestial circles, one half expects Michael Medved and Rush Limbaugh to crash through the theater ceiling brandishing swords.
 
  In the mock-solemn, patently silly universe of "Constantine," it wouldn't look a bit out of place.   

Lest there's any doubt that the title bad-boy demon slayer in Constantine  is not your father's exorcist, consider some select details: The perpetually pissed-off antihero drags on cigarettes with an Up Yours attitude mean enough to cow even a champion death-stick defender like Denis Leary or Fran Lebowitz, and he drinks like a bad novelist. (What does it matter, the wretch is damned anyhow because he attempted suicide years ago and then was vomited back to life from death, although not before glimpsing hell.) While performing an exorcism (resentfully, since he hates the spiritual X-ray vision he was born with), he announces, ''This is Constantine, a--hole'' the way other more pious types might invoke the Holy Trinity. He's got terminal lung cancer, he's antisocial in the extreme, he's sick of working the streets casting out the devil's foot soldiers, but he's hoping the gig will buy him a place in heaven when he does finally kick.
And he's played by Keanu Reeves, an intriguingly (when not maddeningly) inscrutable attraction: Reeves' decision to embody yet another bottled-up loner who messes with the cosmos so soon after the Matrix  franchise is its own existential puzzle for those who would try to pry into the actor's career reality. John Constantine is, let's say,  a creation built out of extreme, randomly assigned traits and  obsessions, just as Constantine  itself is a creation built by rock video director Francis Lawrence (from a script by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello) out of Hellblazer , a long-running DC Comics/Vertigo comic book. The movie is ornate, arbitrary, and fetishistic, too, with the added challenge of being hell to follow for those without access to crib notes. Intellectually, I can admire the emphasis on visual style over plot clarity; I can also appreciate the filmmakers' intention to create a moving-picture interpretation of the stark, still-picture aesthetic of such comics.
Viscerally, I feel shut out of the fun. And not just  because I'm a Hellblazer  newbie. (I was a babe in the X-Men's garden of good and evil not so long ago and have come to love the mutants.) The way I see it, if Constantine  isn't really going to get serious about the fascinating, thorny Catholicism on which it is so somberly grounded, then it's just another comic-book movie, and it might as well lighten up. That's right: This is another busy, clever, fanboy-oriented production that congratulates fanboys for their geek knowledge, then probably disappoints even them, because it's no Hellblazer . It may look good, it may show off some cool stuff (visions of Hades, demons with heads sliced open to resemble serving bowls of oatmeal). But it has no authentic interest in its own subject matter. Instead, the movie sidles up to theological issues of damnation and salvation, the power of prayer and the absolution of sinners, then shrugs and goes for such gimmicky stuff as displaying the war chest of biblically significant ammunition gathered by Beeman (Max Baker), a helpful ally. Impressed by prop-shop dragon's breath from a real dragon or a big mother of a shotgun fashioned out of a hollowed-out crucifix? Constantine 's got 'em.
But no one stakes a claim deep enough to matter in the movie's cold, hard ground. Rachel Weisz plays Angela, a Catholic police detective who seeks out Constantine to help her determine whether her beloved twin (also played by Weisz) really killed herself, but interest soon wanes in the sisters' loss of religious faith (and combustible interest never ignites between Angela and JC  initials noted). A promising subplot about the relationship between Constantine and his young assistant/driver (I, Robot 's Shia LaBeouf) is set aside until it becomes an afterthought. (Those who sit through the very end of the credits are treated to an after-afterthought kicker.) By the time the story spins to the end in an overload of angel-and-devil-rassling, the constant in Constantine   one man's ambivalent search for salvation in a world where it's hard to tell good from evil  has been fractured.
Under the circumstances, the more extreme types carrying passports from heaven and hell have all the fun. Tilda Swinton puts her mesmerizing, androgynous beauty to amusing use as the angel Gabriel; rocker Gavin Rossdale plays Satan's emissary, Balthazar, like a scummy Wall Street smoothie. I'm not sure what Djimon Hounsou's powers are as a nightclub owner, but he wears natty threads. And as Satan, Peter Stormare all but yodels in a performance as nutty as anything Rod Steiger might have come up with to entertain himself when trapped in a cartoon.

ou may recall that in the "Matrix" trilogy, Keanu Reeves played a haunted, expressionless traveler between metaphysical realms whose mission was to unravel a vast, complicated plot to ... well, to do something very bad involving a lot of computer-generated imagery. It may therefore not surprise you to learn that Mr. Reeves, in "Constantine," a new theological thriller from Warner Brothers, plays a haunted, expressionless traveler ... but you get the idea. The thing is, this time his character, John Constantine, wears a skinny tie, white shirt and dark suit combination almost exactly like the one worn by Agent Smith, who was Mr. Reeves's archnemesis in the "Matrix" pictures. I'm still trying to get my mind around that. In the meantime, I will try to reconstruct some impression of "Constantine," which all evidence, save my own memory, insists that I saw not long ago. It's coming back now: a promising opening, somewhere in the Mexican desert, where a dusty scavenger finds a pointy object (a bit of preliminary text has dropped the clue that it might be the Spear of Destiny) and is promptly crushed by a car that drops from the sky. He survives, sprouts an ominous tattoo and sets off for Los Angeles to bring about the apocalypse. Meanwhile, John Constantine is wearily patrolling the border between this world and the one below - a landscape bathed in flaming caramel syrup in which there seem to be an awful lot of cars. (Are cars capable of sin, or do some sinners get to take their wheels with them to hell? This is one of many intriguing doctrinal questions never answered by "Constantine.") His work is pretty routine - performing exorcisms, deporting undocumented demons, glowering - until a conspiracy involving the son of the devil threatens to upset the traditional balance between good and evil and throw the world into chaos. This is similar to the premise of "Little Nicky," an Adam Sandler abomination released in 2000, with Harvey Keitel as Satan, a role here taken by Peter Stormare. But of course "Constantine," directed by Francis Lawrence in glossy music-video style from a script by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello, takes itself much more seriously, with a few clumsy moments of attempted wit. Based on the DC/Vertigo comic book "Hellblazer," the movie tries for a stylized, expressionistic pop grandeur - the kind of eerie, dreamy visual environment that made the first "Matrix" so intriguing - but its look is sticky, murky and secondhand. Its plot unfolds according to the usual numbing alternation of special effects-aided jolts and portentous exposition, most of it involving spurious Bible verses and occultist mumbo jumbo. Assisting Mr. Reeves are Rachel Weisz, as a Los Angeles police detective whose twin sister (also Ms. Weisz) has jumped off the roof of a hospital, and Shia LeBeouf, as Constantine's eager young sidekick and chauffeur. Djimon Hounsou plays a witch doctor and nightclub owner imaginatively named Midnite, Pruitt Taylor Vince plays an alcoholic priest imaginatively named Father Hennessy, and Tilda Swinton is the Angel Gabriel, adding a touch of high-class celestial cross-dressing to this overblown, overlong attempt - which falls just short of success - to make a movie dumber than "Van Helsing." "Constantine" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has many scenes of gruesome violence and occult, demonic themes.

Keanu Reeves' latest man-in-black fantasy is slightly better than "The Matrix" sequels, which is tantamount to damnation with faint praise. Casting its star as a chain-smoking exorcist -- someone who's literally been to hell and back -- this adaptation of the graphic novel "Hellblazer" blazes few new trails and bogs down in a confusing narrative muddle. Atmospheric and noirish in the manner of a poor man's "Blade Runner," pic possesses powerful imagery but lacks feature-length substance and will need a bountiful harvest of opening-weekend souls before a stench resembling brimstone dowses its box office flame.
Director Francis Lawrence's lengthy musicvideo resume includes award-winning work with Justin Timberlake, but the major malfunction here is more of the storytelling than wardrobe variety.
The biggest problem is that most viewers not familiar with pic's relatively obscure source won't be able to comprehend the movie's arcane set of rules. What's left, then, is an episodic series of encounters -- some more visually arresting than others -- with no strong throughline pointing to where the action's ultimately heading.
Nor does it help that Reeves must wrestle with what amounts to a Philip Marlowe-type role as the world-weary and dour John Constantine -- a man cursed by his ability to see the demons that venture into our plane. Once driven to a suicide attempt by those visions, Constantine seeks to gain redemption from the scorching fate that awaits him because of that act by dispatching Satan's minions back to hell. Meanwhile, his cancer-ridden lungs leave him facing his own fast-approaching expiration date.
"I already know exactly where I'm going," he grumbles.
Peculiar goings-on indicate that something big and sinister is coming as demons violate the devil's pact with God by invading our mortal sphere. Along the way, Constantine encounters a cop, Angela (Rachel Weisz), directed to him following the death of her twin sister, whose psychic abilities somehow figure in the plot by the otherworldly forces attempting to "cross over."
Constantine is surrounded by a reasonably colorful group of supporting players, though few receive enough screentime to establish much of a presence. The roster includes a wild-haired aide (Max Baker), eager sidekick Chas ("Project Greenlight's" Shia LeBeouf), a beady-eyed priest (Pruitt Taylor Vince) and a club-owning witch doctor (Djimon Hounsou).
The principally two-character piece nevertheless centers on Reeves and Weisz, punctuated by effective if fleeting special effects but saddled with a malnourished plot. Beyond the occasional wry aside, Reeves doesn't bring enough heft to his character to sell the tough-guy dialogue, and under the circumstances, Weisz can't do much more than come across as a damsel in distress.
Muted cinematography and the grunge-chic decor also contribute to a lifeless tone, and much of the exposition is so garbled in portentous nonsense as to recall Rick Moranis' possessed ranting in "Ghostbusters."
Indeed, whatever meticulous plotting might have gone into the novel, the movie too often seems to be conjuring up twists as it goes along. By the time the climactic sequence arrives, even Satan himself (a well-cast Peter Stormare) can't generate the heat required to salvage things.
Pic does win a few points for style if not substance -- from the impressively realized depiction of hell and Tilda Swinton's striking winged angel Gabriel to Brian Tyler and Klaus Badelt's brooding score.
Reeves' affiliation with "The Matrix" trilogy has burnished his popularity within the comics/sci-fi realm, but such goodwill goes only so far. Like the demonic hordes, "Constantine" looks destined to discover that in the harsh light of day, it's not always easy to cross over.

You'd think people would be gorged on comic-book depictions of good and evil after last year's protracted moral-values muck crawl, but Constantine aims to get us worked up about the state of our souls all over again. Despite its Exorcist-for-speed-freaks effects and clever (if cynical) proposition that heaven and hell are factions in a grand-scale corporate rivalry, the flaccid movie adds nothing to the argument.
Adapted from the DC Comics  series Hellblazer, the film concerns the efforts of John Constantine  (Keanu Reeves )a metaphysical exterminator with dual citizenship in Earth and Hadesto prevent an apocalypse engineered by God's double-dealing right-hand, er, man (Tilda Swinton , in full Orlando  bloom, channeling goggle-eyed Bushian sanctimony). A cop (Rachel Weisz ) investigating her sister's apparent suicide seeks Constantine's help and becomes a pawn in the plot, and Djimon Hounsou  turns up as a "witch doctor" named Papa Midnite , if for no other reason than to give non-comics readers a taste of the medium's tin ear for cultural niceties.
Fans of Hellblazer are bound to be disappointed, as the filmmakers have relocated the character from London's drizzly murk to sun-plagued Los Angeles, and altered him from a stroppy Mancunian chain smoker with terminal lung cancer to a slightly annoyed Yank with no distinguishable regional affect (the perpetual cigarette and disease remain). The changes might not matter if director Francis Lawrence , a music-vid veteran, made better use of L.A.'s film noir bona fides, but aside from the occasional skid row backdrop Constantine could've been shot in Toronto. And while Reeves strives antiheroically for hard-boiled anomie, he's too contained a presence to capture the pathologized romanticism of a true noir burnout (a funny scene involving a highball glass and a spider notwithstanding).
More to the point, the actor's black-on-white getup makes it plain that Constantine is one "whoa" away from Neo-dom, and that Constantine likely represents the start of another Hollywood  franchise with diminishing returns in its future.
