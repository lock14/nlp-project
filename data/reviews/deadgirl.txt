         Writer-director Karen Moncrieff divides "The Dead Girl," her dark follow-up to "Blue Car," into five short stories, each bearing a title referring to one of its characters. A blanched diorama of beaten-down women connected to one another by the hand of a killer, the film captures the sense of desperation that seeps into contemporary life when we are confronted by the inhumane.
 
  Set in the less glamorous corners of Los Angeles County, the movie approaches a single incident from the perspectives of five seemingly unconnected women. In "The Stranger," Toni Collette plays Arden, a spinsterish young woman whose miserable existence caring for her cruel, bed-ridden mother (Piper Laurie) is so unbearable that her discovery of a nude, mutilated body elicts not repulsion but curiosity. Her 15 minutes of fame lead her to an awkward relationship with a creepy grocery clerk (a buffed-out, tattooed Giovanni Ribisi) who displays an almost scholarly knowledge of the tendencies of serial killers.
 


         






    "The Sister," the film's second (and weakest) segment, casts Rose Byrne as Leah, a forensics student who is convinced that the body is that of her missing sister. Even though the sister was abducted 15 years earlier, Leah's mother (Mary Steenburgen) is certain the girl is alive and persists in posting fliers, seeking her return.
 
  At times, Moncrieff holds the spooky key down too often in these first two segments, threatening to squash our curiosity with morbidness and unresolved portent. However, the film finds its groove with "The Wife," featuring a determined Mary Beth Hurt as a fed-up woman who makes a disturbing discovery of her own and then goes to unexpected lengths to maintain her equilibrium.
 
  Equally strong is "The Mother," with Marcia Gay Harden as a fragile yet determined woman retracing the lurid path of her runaway daughter. Even when the worst possible conclusions are reached, the character soldiers on, insistent on trying to do the right thing and possibly repeating her mistakes in the process.
 
  The film's final, eponymous chapter suffers because it mainly conveys information hinted at in the earlier sequences. Brittany Murphy plays the murder victim, an explosive, damaged young woman on the skids. The revelation of her final hours does little to raise the empathy level and instead deflates some of the film's mystery.
 
  If the segments are uneven, Moncrieff — with the help of her excellent cast — nevertheless crafts a gripping overall narrative that exposes a shared dissonance among the protagonists. The serial killer motif is ultimately just a mechanism to illuminate a restrained rage among women on the fringes of society, powerless to stop the continuing cycle of being preyed upon.

 “The Dead Girl” is a movie with a chip on its shoulder. The relentless emotional violence in it, a compendium of five vignettes related to a young woman whose naked, mutilated corpse is discovered on a barren hillside, is of a level rarely found in movies, even those steeped in gore. There is some gore in “The Dead Girl,” but it is eclipsed in intensity by the verbal abuse hurled by its desperately unhappy characters at the people closest to them. All five stories are set in the desolate outliers of Los Angeles, portrayed as a physical and emotional wasteland.  Just when it seems as though the language of insult and humiliation couldn’t get any nastier, the movie escalates the barrage. I think we’re meant to take it personally, as though the director and writer, Karen Moncrieff, were slapping our faces and screaming at us to wake up and face the awful truth; this is how many people (maybe most people) really are. Rage rules.  If the concentrated bile is bracing to a point, I don’t totally buy it. Ms. Moncrieff, whose promising debut film, “Blue Car,” in 2002, explored the seduction of a high school student by her poetry teacher, simply doesn’t know where to stop. “The Dead Girl” seizes on some of the same psychological forces and ratchets them downward on the economic ladder while turning up the volume.  The grim tone is established immediately with “The Stranger,” the story of the body’s discovery by Arden (Toni Collette), a meek young woman caring for her aged mother (Piper Laurie), a foul-mouthed, bedridden termagant who demands to be served hand and foot and rewards that service by calling Arden a two-bit slut and worse. The story follows Arden (who has kinky bondage fantasies) on a date with Rudy (Giovanni Ribisi), a creepy supermarket clerk who recognizes her from the media coverage of the body’s discovery and whose fascination with serial killers hints that he might be the murderer.  In “The Sister,” the weakest of the five pieces, Rose Byrne is Leah, a clinically depressed graduate student in forensics who hopes that the body proves to be that of her missing sister Jenny, who disappeared many years earlier. If it is, she can finally get on with her life and pursue her romance with Derek (James Franco), a gentle, sympathetic co-worker. Mary Steenburgen plays Leah’s mother, Beverly, who stubbornly insists that her long-lost daughter is still alive.  The angry tone returns with a vengeance in “The Wife,” in which Ruth (Mary Beth Hurt), a Bible-thumping harridan who lives in a trailer with her husband, Carl (Nick Searcy), harangues him mercilessly for his mysterious absences during which she is certain he is visiting prostitutes. Carl, who runs a storage facility, is so inured to her tirades that her fury seems to bounce off him. Rummaging through Carl’s belongings while he is out, Ruth discovers evidence of a violent crime and must decide whether to report it or cover it up.  In “The Mother,” the most satisfying vignette, Melora (Marcia Gay Harden), the mother of the dead girl, who has been identified as Krista (Brittany Murphy), drives to the fleabag motel where her daughter shared a room with Rosetta (Kerry Washington), a drug addict and prostitute. Rosetta takes Melora, a typical middle-class mom, to meet Krista’s 3-year-old daughter, Ashley. From Rosetta, Melora finally learns why Krista ran away from home and has her rose-colored vision of her idyllic family life shattered.  The concluding story, “The Dead Girl,” backtracks to the last day of Krista’s life, in which she buys a toy for Ashley’s birthday, and then  — through a series of ugly mishaps involving her pimp and boyfriend (Josh Brolin) and a violent john who beats Rosetta  — ends up hitching a fateful ride to visit her daughter in a neighboring town.  Ms. Murphy’s Krista is a terror: a flailing, spitting and cursing live wire whose emotional anchor in life is a child she is too unstable to care for. In this histrionic performance by an actor who even in roles that call for sweetness and charm conveys hardness and defiance, Ms. Murphy and her disagreeable character mesh.  The movie is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).  It has profanity, sexual situations and violence. 
Karen Moncrieff 's The Dead Girl is the scrap-bag opposite of a torture-porn movieor more precisely, a patchwork made up of the material that wannabe snuff flicks elide. Picture the scene, for example, in the recent Turistas where a topless woman is sliced open on an operating table, only to have a mad doctor remove her organs while she watches. The movie's interest in the character extends no farther than her tits, her guts, and her death.
The Dead Girl begins where the sequence in Turistas ends: with a girl's mutilated body. The movie then conducts what is essentially an investigationnot into the gory details of the killing, but the grim human questions on the periphery. Did the girl have a mother? A child? If so, what did they do next? As for the killer, might he even have a wife/mother/girl of his ownunaware of that drawer out back in storage, where trophies of a secret life are kept?
It's easy to overpraise a movie like the showily acted, arty Dead Girl  because it offers an antidote to Turistas ' zipless bloodlettingjust as it's easy to cop a knee-jerk pose of moral superiority to the torture-porn genre, which can fiddle with our sympathies and taboos in illuminating ways. But Moncrieff's glum, somber film is something of a needed corrective at the moment, when horror movies are turning into weightless exercises in morally sanctioned sadism. Its multipart, fractured structure reverses the effect of Turistas ' meathead surgery The Dead Girl  brings a cold slab of exploitation bait back into focus as a human being.
The body's discovery splits the film into five storiesfour afters and a before, each providing its own partially obscured angle on the crime. The first, "The Stranger," shows the murder's perversely liberating effect on the mousy caretaker (Toni Collette ) who finds the corpse. A missing girl's photograph passes the narrative focus like a baton to "The Sister," in which a forensics grad student (Rose Byrne ) sees the corpse and thinks she's found her long-vanished sibling. Then there's "The Wife" (Mary Beth Hurt ), who finds a connection between the dead girl and her lumpen, secretive husband (Nick Searcy ) and must decide whether the dismal status quo is more appealing than a lonely future. The search of "The Mother" (Marcia Gay Harden ) for her dead daughter's apartment leads to the final sectionin which the girl (Brittany Murphy  in wild-child abandon) suddenly appears as flesh and blood on the last day of her life.
Shot by Michael Grady in half-shadows, The Dead Girl isn't as gimmicky as other films that fit the current vogue for chronologically scrambled, everything-is-connected puzzle movies with bleeding-heart agendas. Moncrieff doesn't force some overlay of cosmic linkage on the storiesthe plot strands that connect the five women are direct and plausible. Neither does the writer-director litter the film with the kind of hammy aha!'s that made Crash  and Babel  such eye-rollers. More often, images and details rhyme between the stories in mysterious ways.
The chief problem with The Dead Girl , as with most current multipart films, is that the truncated stories don't give actors much room to develop a part. They're on-screen for such a short time that they act furiously from the get-go. Collette practically plows through a supermarket with a sign reading "Ask Me About My Misery," and Piper Laurie , playing her mother, actually cackles. Moncrieff's confrontational monologues would make great audition pieces, but in the context of a movie that's exactly how they sound: stagy and overwritten.
And yet Moncrieff, who comes from an acting background, works wonders when she listens closely. The best piece of acting in the whole movie is also the quietest. Having made a horrible discovery that casts her entire married life and future in shadows, Hurt unleashes another desperate, full-throttle tirade about her lousy marriageto which Searcy, the husband, simply says, "I'm sorry." It's not just the contrast between Hurt's near-hysteria and his eerie, mournful calm, it's the shading in Searcy's inflectiona mixture of chilling moral absence and distant regretthat suggests unfathomable inner darkness. In such moments, The Dead Girl  is the best kind of psychological puzzle movie: the kind that can't be solved.
