If you�ve seen the schlocky trailer for The Pursuit of Happyness
, you�ve seen a better version of the actual film. Based on a true story, the movie follows Chris Gardner (Smith), a self-made success who trained as a stockbroker while homeless and raising a young son on the streets of San Francisco. When the film begins, Gardner's life balances between despair and disaster. His ultrabitchy wife (Newton) can�t criticize her husband enough, his fledgling entrepreneurial endeavors drain his savings, and his wistfully wise son (played by Smith�s actual son, Jaden) needs love. Although it's clear that the situation is bad, the filmmakers are relentless in their portrait of just how awful it is. After his wife walks out on the family, Gardner and son get kicked out of both their apartment and a seedy motel. Ultimately, father and son have no choice but to crash at a variety of homeless shelters, subways, or in one particularly wrenching sequence, in a public bathroom. But Gardner possesses both a dream and supernatural drive. When he has a chance encounter with a stockbroker, he learns that you don�t need to have a college degree to achieve wealth and, natch, happiness. So he obsessively focuses on getting accepted into an internship program at a highly competitive brokerage firm. As Gardner works incessantly to keep his dream alive and his son cared for, the humanity of his character remains absent. He ceases to be a person in exchange for a goal-oriented machine. We watch as Gardner submits to his bullying manager, finds rejection from homeless shelters, and struggles to keep five dollars in his pocket. But we don�t see any vulnerability. As any savvy viewer knows, this movie has to have a happy ending, although you have to sit through nearly two hours of contrived torment to get there. Truly, Gardner�s real-life story is one of unbelievable triumph against insurmountable odds, yet the film so relentlessly pursues the character�s obstacles that when hope does come, it�s simply a case of too little too late. And as likable as Smith is, his character is never fleshed out beyond that of the self-made superman. Though pretty to look at (with camerawork by Phedon Papamichael) and inspiring to contemplate, this story of human triumph needs a lot more of the human for an audience to actually experience the triumph.


"The Pursuit of Happyness" is a curious bird to have landed in this awards-conscious season. For one thing, Will Smith's performance as a striving single dad has the grace to not panhandle for an Oscar. For another, there's very little self-congratulation about the film, and much that's uncomfortably dark. A quietly agonized drama of reaching and missing and reaching again, it takes place in the crack between the American dream and its nightmare shadow. It's a fine film, with a portrait of fatherhood that feels scuffed and driven and real.
The movie is set in San Francisco at the height of the Reagan '80s, for no other reason than that it's based on a true story. Smith plays Chris Gardner, the kind of man who once was a whip - smart kid but has never realized his potential. Having sunk his savings into a line of medical scanners that aren't selling, Chris is beginning to fray at the seams. His wife, Linda (Thandie Newton, looking worn to the bone), can't handle the stress, especially when her husband impulsively decides he'd rather be a stockbroker instead.
Soon enough, Chris has solo care of his 5-year-old son, Christopher (played by Smith's own son, Jaden). Using his natural bravado and a knack with a Rubik's Cube, the 30-something high school graduate talks himself into a six-month internship at Dean Witter, with a long-shot chance for a job at the end. The catch is that there's no pay.
"The Pursuit of Happyness" -- the title comes from a misspelled schoolhouse mural -- has a lot on its mind but mostly this: If America is about the promise of bettering oneself, why does it have to be so freaking hard
?
Chris has one foot on an escalator going up and one foot on an elevator plummeting into the socioeconomic basement. While the other interns work late, he has to get his son out of day care. Casual misfortunes pile up; homelessness nears, like an out-of-control car spinning toward the hero in slow-motion. Which Chris will become the real one? The can-do salesman in a suit or the father desperately protecting his son in the wee hours of a city shelter?
The film has been lightly fictionalized from the life of the actual Chris Gardner, who has since written his own inspirational autobiography of the same name. The movie's not as interested in uplift, though, as it is in panic and the resourcefulness it engenders.
Chris is a charmer, and he never stops running -- to do so would be to admit defeat to his son -- but Smith nevertheless conveys the gradual erosion of a man's self-worth. I don't think I've seen a mainstream movie get fatherhood so right since "Kramer vs . Kramer": the fear, the indulgence, the snappishness, the pre-occupied "uh-huhs" as a child natters about his day, the steamrolling waves of love. Maybe Smith's got it easy because he's playing opposite his son (Jaden certainly looks comfortable hanging with his dad), but the understated beauty of the performance lies in how little attention Chris actually gives the kid. He's too busy worrying about Christopher to be with him.
The director is Gabriele Muccino, the writer-director of the 2001 Italian art - house hit "The Last Kiss," from which this year's substandard Zach Braff movie was extracted. There's a European sensibility to the storytelling: Behavior here is observed rather than underlined, and where an American director might overplay the racial divide between Chris and his WASPy bosses at Dean Witter, Muccino and screenwriter Steven Conrad ("The Weather Man") let it go. The top man at the firm, played by that dear old character actor James Karen , is happy to grant Chris his humanity. Hejust can't see that the man's drowning.
"The Pursuit of Happyness" is also a San Francisco movie to its bones, with a very specific sense of place and vibe. (The WASPs probably wouldn't be quite as inviting in an East Coast film.) But everything about it is specific, from the gray peppering Smith's hair to the hush of a wealthy suburb on a weekend afternoon in one scene.
There are a few too many coincidences involving errant medical scanners, and that Rubik's Cube is both a screenwriter's invention and a cross-promoter's dream. By and large, though, the film stays clear of Hollywood mucking about. Again, it's a curious movie for the season -- a reminder of how close we dance to the pit, how easy it is to fall in, how heartbreakingly difficult it can be to clamber out. This alone makes it a welcome holiday meal. Smith's portrait of resilience and Muccino's clarity of heart are simply the gravy.


         Among the inalienable rights promised in the preamble of the Declaration of Independence, happiness is the only one not guaranteed. We are theoretically assured of life and liberty, but happiness we are left to pursue on our own. "The Pursuit of Happyness," a routine domestic drama starring Will Smith, is the story of one man's unwavering pursuit for a better life (and presumably happiness with an "i") against long odds.
 
 The movie is "inspired by a true story," that of Chris Gardner, who was among San Francisco's working homeless in the early '80s and managed to pull himself and his young son up by the bootstraps. "Inspired by" is an interesting phrase because the movie is more inspiring than inspired. The man's struggles are emotionally engaging, but dramatically it lacks the layering of a "Kramer vs. Kramer," which it superficially resembles.
 


         






   This is a much lower-key performance than we're used to seeing from Smith, and he pulls it off admirably. He plays the fictionalized Gardner as an intelligent, energetic guy who can't catch a break. In fact, in the sluggish Bay Area economy of 1981, he's losing ground. He's invested his family's money in a load of cutting-edge bone-density scanners that, unfortunately for him, provide a slightly better image than an X-ray at twice the cost.
 
 Though the subject matter is serious, the film itself is rather slight, and it relies on the actor to give it any energy. Even in a more modest register, Smith is a very appealing leading man, and he makes Gardner's plight compelling.
 
 Running from doctor's office to hospital peddling his scanners, we see Chris' plentiful people skills at work. Still, there's not enough money coming in, and his wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), who's been working double shifts in a laundry, leaves him to care alone for their 5-year-old son, Christopher (played by Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith's son, 7-year-old Jaden Christopher Syre Smith).
 
 With his finances at less than zero, Chris embarks on an unpaid six-month internship at the end of which one of 20 hopefuls will land a job as a stockbroker. Staying one step ahead of the taxman and moving from apartment to motel to shelter to subway station, Chris is a model of persistence as he clings to his dream.
 
 The most effective aspect of the film is the relationship between father and son. It's a love story in the purest sense as Chris tries to shield Christopher from the hardships they face, and it's instances like this that makes you think nepotism can be a good thing.
 
 The younger Smith, who reportedly auditioned for the part, is precocious but not annoyingly so. He's inherited his parents' good looks and has impeccable comic timing, enlivening the gloomier stretches of the story.
 
 Steve Conrad wrote the screenplay after executive producer Mark Clayman saw a "20/20" story on the real-life Gardner, and he litters the movie Gardner's path with nonstop obstacles, many of which are so improbable they must be true. Italian director Gabriele Muccino (whose film "The Last Kiss" was recently remade with Zach Braff) keeps a low profile, allowing the Smiths to carry the day.
 
 "The Pursuit of Happyness" is an unexceptional film with exceptional performances and, if you're curious, takes its title's quirky spelling from a mural outside Christopher's Chinatown day-care center. There are worse ways to spend the holidays, and, at the least, it will likely make you appreciate your own circumstances.
 
 

 
 MPAA rating:

Will Smith doesn't seem the likeliest candidate to play a desperate, struggling man. Whatever the role (love coach, alien fighter, Ali), he projects speed and good times, an almost aerobic self-confidence. But in The Pursuit of Happyness , which is set in San Francisco in 1981, at the dawn of the age of go-go capitalism, Smith doesn't just wear a few flecks of gray in his hair. He slows himself down, playing a man who awakens to the reality that life is nickel-and-diming him to death. It's a beautiful and understated performance, one that hums with a richer, quieter music than Smith has mustered before.
What hooks you in this shrewdly touching movie, based on a true story, is how specific  it is about one man's economic perils. Smith's Chris Gardner is an earnest fellow in his late 30s who sells medical equipment  or, rather, one particular item, a high-density bone scanner that he hawks, with middling success, on a freelance basis. His mistake was to invest his savings in these contraptions, and now he's stuck, toting them around town like oversize typewriters. His marriage has fallen apart, and when the prickly, impatient Linda (Thandie Newton) takes off, leaving Chris and his young son (played by Smith's son Jaden with a sly-eyed lack of fuss that matches nicely with his father's), he applies for the internship program at Dean Witter, where he'll compete to be a stockbroker. Smith makes Chris a go-getter with a hint of sadness  a bit of a fuddy-duddy, but a smart, dogged one. (He gets his foot in the door by solving a Rubik's Cube.)
In The Pursuit of Happyness , we don't just know Chris' dreams. We know his bank account, his tally of parking tickets, his back taxes. The fact that he's African-American is there at the margins  he would surely have gone to college had he come from a less hardscrabble background  but the real issue is the subtler one of class mobility in America. Since the internship is unsalaried, Chris is forced to survive by other measures, and what this means is that the job is really geared to people who've already attained middle-class solidity. Chris has to pretend to be something he's not, and the power of Smith's acting is in the gentle, mounting fury with which he absorbs a hundred misperceptions and slights.
As compelling as the film is, it does have a rather single-minded, one-ordeal-after-another, Murphy's Law quality. Yet the director, Italy's Gabriele Muccino, lends a humane touch even to the running joke of Chris getting his bone scanners stolen, and the plot is an inexorable chain of money logic: Chris' escape from a cabbie he can't afford to pay, his looming tax crisis, his move to a hotel and, finally, a homeless shelter. The lower he falls, the more Smith endows him with a ragged nobility and will. The Pursuit of Happyness  speaks eloquently to the anxieties of our own time, when staying afloat, let alone movin' on up, has rarely been tougher.

 A fairy tale in realist drag, “The Pursuit of Happyness” is the kind of entertainment that goes down smoothly until it gets stuck in your craw. Inspired by a true story, as they like to say in Hollywood, the film traces the fleeting ups and frightening downs of Chris Gardner, whose efforts to keep his family from sinking into poverty evolve into a life-and-death struggle of social Darwinian proportions. It’s the early 1980s, and while Ronald Reagan is delivering the bad economic news on television, Chris is about to prove you don’t need an army to fight the war on poverty, just big smiles and smarts, and really sturdy shoes. (It also helps that the star playing him is as innately sympathetic as Will Smith.)  Given  how often Chris breaks into a run on the streets of San Francisco, it’s a good thing his shoes are well built; his lungs, too. Written by Steven Conrad and directed by Gabriele Muccino, “The Pursuit of Happyness” recounts how Chris, plagued by some bad luck, a few stupid moves and a shrew for a wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), loses his apartment and, with his 5-year-old, Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith, Mr. Smith’s own beautiful son), joins the ranks of the homeless, if not the hopeless. Evicted from the mainstream and bounced from shelter to shelter, Chris holds firm to his dignity, resolve, faith, love and independence. His optimism sweeps through the film like a searchlight, scattering clouds and dark thoughts to the wind.  It’s the same old bootstraps story, an American dream artfully told, skillfully sold. To that calculated end, the filmmaking is seamless, unadorned, transparent, the better to serve Mr. Smith’s warm expressiveness. That warmth feels truthful, as does the walk-up apartment Chris’s family lives in at the start of the film, which looks like the real paycheck-to-paycheck deal. As does the day care center, which is so crummy it can’t even get happiness right (hence the title).  This is no small thing, considering the film industry’s usual skewed sense of economic class, a perspective encapsulated by the insider who described the middle-class family in “Little Miss Sunshine” to me as working class, perhaps because the mother drives a gently distressed Miata rather than next year’s Mercedes.  Money matters in “The Pursuit of Happyness,” as it does in life. But it matters more openly in this film than it does in most Hollywood stories that set their sights on the poor, largely because Chris’s pursuit of happiness eventually becomes interchangeable with his pursuit of money. He doesn’t want just a better, more secure life for himself and his child; either by scripted design or by the example of the real Chris Gardner, he seems to yearn for a life of luxury, stadium box seats and the kind of sports car he stops to admire in one scene. His desires aren’t just upwardly mobile; they’re materialistically unbound. Instead of a nice starter home, he (and the filmmakers) ogles mansions. It’s no wonder he hopes to become a stockbroker.  That may sound like a punch line, at least to some ears, but it’s the holy grail in “The Pursuit of Happyness.” A self-starter, Chris has sunk all of the family’s money into costly medical scanners that he tries to sell to doctors and hospitals. But the machines are overpriced, and the sure thing he banked on has landed them in debt. Forced to work two shifts at a dead-end job, Linda angrily smolders and then rages at Chris, which seems reasonable since he has gambled all of their savings on an exceptionally foolish enterprise. (And, unlike her, he hasn’t signed up for overtime.) But this is a film about father love, not mother love, and Linda soon leaves the picture in a cloud of cigarette smoke and a storm of tears.  Chris and the filmmakers seem happy to see her go, but life only gets tougher once she and her paychecks disappear. Much of the film involves Chris’s subsequent efforts to keep himself and his child housed and fed while he is enrolled in an unpaid internship program at a powerful stock brokerage firm. Bright and ferociously determined, Chris easily slides into this fantastical world of shouting men, ringing phones, gleaming surfaces and benevolent bosses. He goes along to get along, and when one of his bosses asks for money to pay for a cab, he quickly opens his wallet. Chris himself stiffs another working man for some money because that wallet is so light. But this is a film about him, not the other guy.  How you respond to this man’s moving story may depend on whether you find Mr. Smith’s and his son’s performances so overwhelmingly winning that you buy the idea that poverty is a function of bad luck and bad choices, and success the result of heroic toil and dreams. Both performances are certainly likable in the extreme, though Mr. Smith shined brighter and was given much more to do when he played the title character in Michael Mann’s underrated “Ali.” That film proves an interesting comparison with this one, not in filmmaking terms, but in its vision of what it means to be a black man struggling in America. In one, a black man fights his way to the top with his fists; in the other, he gets there with a smile.  “The Pursuit of Happyness” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes mild adult language and some parental fighting.

The fact-inspired drama "The Pursuit of Happyness" is more inspirational than creatively inspired -- imbued with the kind of uplifting, afterschool-special qualities that can trigger a major toothache. Clearly savoring the chance to work alongside his moppet son, Will Smith is in serious mode as Chris Gardner, whose story is one of perseverance overcoming tremendous hardship. Smith's heartfelt performance is easy to admire. But the movie's painfully earnest tone should skew its appeal to the portion of the audience that, admittedly, has catapulted many cloying TV movies into hits, and an endorsement from Oprah Winfrey on her popular talkshow can't hurt.
Strictly in political terms, the film could hardly be more finely tuned -- offering a sympathetic view of those struggling to stay out of poverty as well as a "pull yourself up by the bootstraps" message. And in that calculation resides its basic flaw -- a nagging sense throughout that we're being emotionally played.
Deriving its title from a misspelling at the San Francisco daycare center where Gardner parks his son, the narrative unfolds in 1981 as the protagonist's voiceover narration identifies various chapters in his life. At its core, there's a grand sense of the American dream in Gardner's rags-to-riches experience -- a guy who found himself homeless and sleeping in subway stations, only to become a multimillionaire. "The Pursuit of Happyness" devotes its two hours entirely to that struggle, wrenching as it often is.
Gardner states at the outset that he didn't know his own father and was determined not to let that happen with his own children. Unfortunately, he squanders his savings investing in a medical gizmo, driving a wedge between him and his wife (Thandie Newton), who eventually takes flight.
At that point, the film becomes a bit of "Kramer vs. Kramer" meets "Homeless to Harvard," as single dad Chris endeavors to keep himself and his 5-year-old son, Christopher (Jaden Christopher Syre Smith), afloat financially while pursuing a tantalizing but maddening opportunity: an unpaid internship at brokerage firm Dean Witter Reynolds that offers no promise of employment at the six-month trial's conclusion.
Along the way, Chris rides an economic roller-coaster, at various points having to sleep in a shelter or, worse, a BART station restroom -- cleverly turning the latter ordeal into a game to help his not-fully-understanding boy endure the night. Still, because anyone who has done the slightest research knows this tale is ultimately one of capitalistic triumph (there wouldn't be a movie otherwise), the building toward that inevitable climax proves a sometimes arduous slog.
The younger Smith is allowed to deliver a natural, childlike performance, though occasionally Gabriele Muccino, the Italian helmer of "The Last Kiss" making his English-language debut, and writer Steven Conrad unhelpfully saddle the tot with big, chewy mouthfuls of dialogue.
For the most part, though, the movie is the elder Smith's showcase, and he throws his all into the role. Yet while there are occasional flashes of personality -- such as the moment when Gardner wows a potential employer (Brian Howe) by mastering a Rubik's cube -- the circumstances restrain him, as the movie operates in a rather narrow emotional range before its eventual payoff. (Gardner, credited as an associate producer, came to the producers' attention via a "20/20" profile, and only a brief footnote addresses his subsequent accomplishments.)
Technically, pic does a nice job of re-creating the Bay Area a quarter-century ago through music and wardrobe, and Andrea Guerra's score establishes a properly melancholy tone. In the final accounting, however, "The Pursuit of Happyness" winds up being a little like the determined salesman Mr. Gardner himself: easy to root for, certainly, but not that much fun to spend time with.

About Will Smith 's estimable talents, there is no doubt. Six Degrees of Separation , Ali , um . . . the "Parents Just Don't Understand" videothe man's got skills to pay the bills, yours, mine, and his. That he seldom uses them, or their attendant clout, is dispiriting. This is an actor coming off a streak that includes, in order and with no omissions, Men in Black II ; Bad Boys II ; I, Robot ; Shark Tale;  and Hitch . With that barely breathing body of work, he's single-handedly programming Cinemax and  Showtime but creating a legacy better served by Fresh Prince  reruns.
What better path to redemption, then, than a film about, gosh, redemption? The Pursuit of Happyness  is the true-life tale of Chris Gardner , who, it can be said without fear of treading into cliché, lived a rags-to-riches life. In the early 1980s, Gardner pounded the San Francisco pavement trying to off-load the expensive, perhaps even unnecessary, medical scanners into which he had sunk his family's nest egg. As the bank account emptied, so did his home: His girlfriend left him with their son, and by 1983, Gardner was sleeping in San Francisco's Union Square and eating in soup kitchens.
Yet at the same time, Gardner was also interning, gratis, at Dean Witter . Eventually he wound up not only securing a job with the stock brokerage, but forming his own investment company, which he's currently in the midst of selling for multimillions.A fresh prince, indeed.
Smith loves this guyor, at the very least, this role, a feel-bad part in a feel-good movie about a man whose life crumbles and collapses bit by agonizing bit till it's made whole and happy in the final minutes. Playing against his standard type (wiseass talking smack in the back row), Smith shows necessary restraint, but in the end you're constantly aware that he's reminding us of his range: I can grin and  frown, see?
The movie, the first English-language film directed by Italian Gabriele Muccino , is too emotionally slick to work, too visually glib to have an impact, made by people who think grit is something that's brought in by the prop department: We get Will Smith with a 1980s 'fro, a hangdog mustache, and shabby suitsa movie star playing dress-down dress-up. The only actor the audience will buy is young Jaden Christopher Syre Smith  in the part of Chris's sonbecause he is, in fact, Will Smith's son, and their scenes together possess an instantly recognizable intimacy that can't be feigned or forced. There is no denying the tear-jerking power of the scene in a bus station bathroom where the son passes out on his father's lap as the old man guards the door from interlopers who would disturb their last sanctuary.
Still, The Pursuit of Happyness  only digs deep enough to impart something you already know: It's far better to be rich than broke. Draped in the flag, which flutters in almost every scene to remind us that Gardner's is the quintessential tale of the American dream come true, the movie eschews the darkest parts of its subject's backstory: his abusive stepfather, the mother who did time in prison for trying to burn down the house with the stepfather in it, the years a young Gardner spent bouncing around foster homes. We know nothing of this man, save for the fact that he made a terrible investment that cost him his woman and his apartmentand that two hours later, he's rich because the end scroll tells us so. Go see this and you're just making the wealthy a little wealthier.
