There's a dark, abiding mystery at the center of ''An American Haunting," and it's how on earth major stars such as Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek were talked into appearing in this film. A cringingly awful period ghost story, ''Haunting" is amateur hour all around: The script is DOA, the performances struggle to reach the level of community theater, and Caine Davidson's incessant score wouldn't pass muster on a daytime soap.
The thing barely qualifies as a movie. Trust me, you'll find more compelling drama in the historical reenactments at Old Sturbridge Village.
As written and directed by Courtney Solomon (his only other credit is 2000's ''Dungeons and Dragons," but that starred Jeremy Irons -- who does this guy know
?), ''An American Haunting" purports to tell the true story of the Bell Witch, a poltergeist who tormented the Bell family of Adams Station, Tenn., in the early 1800s. The opening titles describe the case as ''the most documented haunting in American history" but neglect to mention that almost all the ''documentation" was the work of a local newspaperman whose book on the subject was published 70 years after the fact.
Aside from a few incomprehensible modern-day scenes that bracket the story, ''Haunting" takes place back on the Tennessee frontier, where local farmer John Bell (Sutherland) gets into a land dispute with neighbor Kate Batts (Gaye Brown), who's rumored to be a witch.
Indeed, strange things begin to happen in the bedroom of oldest daughter Betsy (Rachel Hurd-Wood, Wendy in the most recent ''Peter Pan"): Bedcovers fly off, and the girl is held by an unseen force in midair while being repeatedly slapped. John and his wife, Lucy (Spacek), are horrified, and even a skeptic like handsome young schoolteacher Mr. Powell (James D'Arcy) comes around when the crucifixes start flying off the walls.
Unfortunately, ''Haunting" doesn't have a plot, per se, so much as one lame spectral assault after another, followed by a twist ending that only confuses the issue. Solomon films it all through a misty veil that suggests a feminine hygiene ad, and the camera rockets around so insistently that physical nausea is added to aesthetic pain. If the director is saying anything here, it's ''We've got a Steadicam and we're not afraid to use it."
The actors deliver their lines and look for the available exits. Sutherland still has his ''Pride and Prejudice" hair on and is as professional as he can be under the circumstances, but Hurd-Wood and Spacek appear to have been stunned, either by a heavy object or the script or both. ''Haunting" gets points as easily the worst film Spacek has appeared in; Hurd-Wood is still young, of course, and Sutherland -- well, he'd show up for a wedding video if the food was good.
At certain points, you may wonder if ''An American Haunting" is meant as parody. A couple of shots of Betsy passed out on her schoolroom desk like a drunken frat girl almost seem calculated to get a laugh. But then the camera staggers off once more and the music kicks into aural overdrive and you realize these people are serious -- astoundingly inept, yes, but serious.
Perhaps a few credulous moviegoers will buy it, but the rest will write it off as one more regional ghost story gone flat-line on the big screen. Even so, ''An American Haunting" sets the bar at a new low: It makes ''The Blair Witch Project" look like a masterpiece of world cinema.


         It's not every horror movie that slouches into multiplexes set in the Tennessee wilderness during the Monroe administration. (Monroe, as in James Monroe, U.S. president from 1817 to 1825? "Era of Good Feeling"? The guy with the doctrine?) It turns out that "An American Haunting," in its elemental, B-movie fashion, dares other unusual things as well. Using alleged "actual events" as a template, writer-director Courtney Solomon fashions a crafty mystery with joy-buzzer jolts cutting through its somberness.
 
  It deals with what's purported to be the one documented case in America of a death attributed to a ghost. In 1818 John Bell (Donald Sutherland), a farmer in Red River, Tenn., begins hearing and seeing wolves that aren't there. His beloved daughter Betsy (Rachel Hurd-Wood) starts getting a strange feeling that someone she can't see is climbing into her bed.
 


         






    Her father and mother (Sissy Spacek) think Betsy's only having bad dreams. Then other strange noises, including slamming doors and whispered voices, make themselves known, and Betsy levitates. The parents are convinced this craziness comes from a curse by the local crazy lady. Why no one thinks of barbecuing the alleged witch is just one of many unanswered questions.
 
  Solomon ("Dungeons & Dragons") appears to be aiming for a kind of gothic-Americana version of the insinuating horror films imported from Japan. At times, the narrative thread slips the movie's grasp and there are flat spots in which characters just scream and thrash. Given what its ending aims for (don't ask), such interludes feel flabby and gratuitous even with Sutherland and Spacek providing gravitas to the ghoulishness.   

What's the key to the early-19th-century mystery of the Bell family of Red River, Tenn., so traumatized by a ghost (or something) that one family member died? An American Haunting  suggests an answer, not to be spilled here except to say that men are E-V-I-L and women are victims. (Ooh, that old truism.) The unnecessarily famous cast for such a standard, creaking, fake-spooky ghost story (with Bible verses thrown in for good measure) includes Sissy Spacek and Donald Sutherland as Ma and Pa Bell, both gamely clutching shawls and muskets and such.

 "An American Haunting" is scary all right, but not for anyone in the audience. Nor does anything in it quake the boots of Rachel Hurd-Wood, who, in the role of Betsy Bell, pretends to be slapped around, moaned at and generally terrorized by an invisible ghost. No, the terror here is suffered exclusively by Donald Sutherland and Sissy Spacek; their participation can be explained only by some unfathomable deal with Satan.  It is possible, given his hairdo, makeup and costuming, that Mr. Sutherland simply wandered over on his lunch break from "Pride and Prejudice" and was tricked into the role of John Bell Sr., patriarch of a beleaguered clan of 19th-century Tennesseans. After a land dispute with a neighbor ruins his reputation, John finds his house visited by a mysterious spirit with a penchant for pulling hair and knocking over furniture.  Lucy (Ms. Spacek), his wife, is powerless to stop this supernatural silliness until, in the surprise denouement, she isn't. At which point "An American Haunting" exchanges bottom-barrel metaphysics for even cheaper psychology.  Written and directed by Courtney Solomon, best unknown as the man who brought "Dungeons and Dragons" to the big screen, "An American Haunting" purports to be based on a documented event, although most of its inspiration has been drawn from the empty well of "The Exorcist" and its progeny.  "An American Haunting" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Extremely loud sound effects try their best to spook you.

The hard-core "jump-scare" crowd may well succumb to "An American Haunting," but auds who prefer their screamfests to be something more than nerve-wracking will avoid this Federalist-era "Exorcist" like a case of demonic possession. Look for some theatrical, thanks to the weight of the cast, but a limited lifespan, due to an uncertainty about its audience: The fright quotient is strictly for the slumber-party crowd, but the plot payoff is about sexual abuse and incest.ï¿½
Sissy Spacek are John and Lucy Bell, land-owning 1817 Tennesseans and parents of the nubile Betsy Bell (Rachel Hurd-Wood) and the stalwart John Jr. (Thom Fell). When John Sr. is found guilty of loan-sharking by his fellow churchmen, the victim of his greed apparently puts a curse on the family; shortly thereafter young Betsy starts having nightmares of the Elm Street variety.
Based on Brent Monahan's novel, "The Bell Witch: An American Haunting" -- which was itself based on what is apparently the only known case in which the U.S. government acknowledged a death by supernatural forces -- "American Haunting" is a difficult film to get a grip on. The opening seems almost satiric -- a young girl runs through the woods pursued by something she can't escape and we can't see, the p.o.v. shifting from stalker to prey. Then the girl wakes up: She is a descendant of the Bells, and a letter left for her mother flashes back the action nearly 200 years.
Writer-director Courtney Solomon seems to have been undecided whether or not to make a comedy: The acting is so arch, the mannerisms so deliberate, that they send up not only satanic-possession thrillers but post-Revolutionary America in general. Sutherland is an anachronismadopting neither the inflections nor formal manner of his co-stars. But then John Bell is a man alone, whose sins will be the undoing of his family.
Solomon is particularly enamored of rapidly burning candles to signify fleeting time; scratch marks left by fingernails dragged demonically across painted pinewood floors. Betsy gets thrown around like a ragdoll during her many screaming nightmares.
There are moments of comedy relief. One night, when the attic sounds like it's full of elephants, Lucy Bell, deadpan, asks her husband: "Squirrels?" James D'Arcy plays the local teacher and all-around authority Richard Powell with conviction, but Richard's skepticism about Betsy's possession becomes a bit hard to swallow, especially after half the town has seen her dangling from the rafters with her face getting slapped, as if by the disembodied spirit of Moe Howard.
A well-made, good-looking movie it is, but between the non-stop tumult and the sense of deliberateness about its period authenticity, "An American Haunting" produces a lot of screaming, crying and cruelty, but not much drama.

Writer-director Courtney Solomon  has taken a tantalizing footnote from America's haunted pastÂa ghost story fascinating precisely for its grounding in historical recordÂand reduced it to another tame, lame serving of PG-13 shocks. For four years, starting in 1817, the Bell family of Tennessee was terrorized by an unseen force, which eventually hounded patriarch John Bell  to his grave. Donald Sutherland  plays Bell, and Sissy Spacek  uses her wraithlike presence to keen effect as his wife, Lucy; they're overqualified for a project that relies mainly on shaky-cam mayhem and snarling wolves amped to 11. The movie creates some moody Hammer-horror atmospherics using shadows, candlelight, and darkened woods. But when it comes to the kind of blatant shocks favored by mall rats, the limits of Solomon's toolbox become painfully apparent: The movie exhausts its blast-in-the-face scares through repetition. A wasted opportunityÂ especially since the events as reported scarcely need embellishing.
