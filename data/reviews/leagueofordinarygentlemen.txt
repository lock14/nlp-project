If you want a whiff of how unironic the 1970s were, consider bowling, a sport that on any given weekend was broadcast (usually on ABC) with the hushed solemnity of a moon launch. Who, exactly, were these doughy men in their loose-fitting shirts, their every spare greeted with a burst of applause? In its early scenes, Chris Browne's documentary A League of Ordinary Gentlemen  looks fondly back at an era when bowling was the most popular leisure activity in America  a middle- and working-class ritual of resplendent squareness. As a spectator sport, however, bowling went into decline (it was dropped by ABC in 1997), and the heart of the movie is the game, funny, and stubbornly inspiring attempt to bring it back. We meet the trio of retired Microsoft geeks who purchased the Pro Bowlers Association for $5 million, and also the sports marketer they hired to repackage bowling, replete with ''attitude'' and sponsorship by Odor-Eaters. The players who helped him do it include a handful of the veteran pin warriors of the '80s, such as Wayne Webb, whose now-fading skills provide moments of bitter poignance. If you want a whiff of how ironic this era is, check out Pete Weber, who made himself the bad-boy showman of bowling simply by wearing sunglasses and following up a strike with his patented ''crotch chop''  an ebullient double-hand bounce that's a celebration of his masterly, uh...balls.

League of Ordinary Gentlemen," an affectionate though unconvincing documentary, struggles to present professional bowling as a simpler, nobler pastime from a simpler, nobler time. But the film, like the sport itself, falters as it follows the words and deeds of its heroes: the bowling contests never seem to reach the level of other crowd-pleasing athletics, and too often,  the winners seem like losers. Take, for instance, Pete Weber, a coarse, mustachioed showman whose record of  toppling pins makes him  part of a proud dynasty. His father, Dick, was a mild-mannered champion of the previous generation of professional bowlers, and the film showcases this St. Louis family as if  it were the Bushes of these bush leagues. The son, like the president, is a reformed bad boy trying to do his prim father proud. The younger Weber's recent success, however, comes not so much through skill - though he does bowl enough strikes and spares to win tournaments - as through the successful marketing of himself as a camera-ready aggressor. He steps into the spotlight or celebrates a well-spun roll of the ball with his signature two-armed gesture, what he calls the "crotch chop." It's some weird backward bend that signals male bravado but that inadvertently winds up saying "look at me" and "laugh at me" at the same time. It occurs even to Mr. Weber that he needs a new shtick. In the film's setup, any such criticism of the sport and its blue-collar enthusiasts is deemed snobbish. The disbanding of bowling leagues and the darkening of many quaint lanes are blamed on the arrival of television, which sucked people out of nighttime public places and into spectator seats in their own living rooms. There, slicker packages of entertainment presumably spoiled some collective interest in this sport, but honestly, the film's big-tournament finale did not deliver any surprises, � la "Spellbound," about how engrossing a presumably boring contest can be. It's a  pity, but for many people, bowling is the watched pot that never boils. Esteemed theorists like Robert Putnam contribute  sound bites; Mr. Putnam describes  his much-discussed "Bowling Alone" theory about such a dismantling of subcultures. Then, lesser experts, including the actor Timothy Busfield,  champion the average Joes of the sport. Wearing one of those two-tone shirts, Mr. Busfield addresses the camera while posing in front of the Stuckey Bowl set from the canceled NBC series "Ed";  thus, he comes off as the last baby boomer standing in a fizzled retro-chic fad. Perhaps the film's true hero is  Steve Miller, whom new investors enlist to restore the Professional Bowlers Association to some fiscal solvency and televised glory. He recruits ESPN, with its many hours to fill, and Odor-Eaters, with its endorsement dollars, even though that  sponsorship was first derisively suggested in the Farrelly brothers' mocking take on bowling, the movie "Kingpin." Mr. Miller's league is at least capitalizing on the insult. Mr. Miller uses profanity-filled chalk talks to rouse the bowlers into some telegenic fury, but they are too lumpen, inarticulate or broken by the pro league's sad downturn to lift the sport's,  or the film's, prospects. Directing his first feature, Christopher  Browne shows flair and determination in getting the movie's   pathos down pat,   but he can't quite find enough that is pleasurable in its many reels.

Immensely entertaining docu about, of all things, professional bowling, demands absolutely no familiarity with the game to appreciate the story of an effort by corporate investors to transform a blue-collar sport fallen on hard times into a cable-ready, advertiser-friendly media darling. First-time helmer Chris Browne's sense of humor captures perfectly the contradictions, absurdities and drama at the intersection of class, media, money and sports without dissing any of his player/subjects. Though snazzy pic could break out theatrically, it may be hard to get auds to shell out bucks for bowling -- the very problem "Gentlemen" explores.
Clips, many from the game's sunnier days during Chris Schenkel's weekend Pro Bowler telecasts on ABC, trace the history of what was once the biggest participatory sport in America. Popularity plummeted in the '90s, a decline exacerbated when ABC dropped coverage in 1997.
Yet even in its heyday, there was something vaguely risible about bowling. Tournament professionals often refused to admit what they did for a living.
Even after all the 21st century image-polishing mandated by the PBA's new CEO, Steve Miller (hired by the former Microsoft execs who now own the org), the newly crowned World Champion can be found atop his trailer scraping ice off the roof -- with retirement for other past champs offering ownership not of restaurants or bars but of traveling Karaoke stands.
Pic follows four pro bowlers, three fortysomething veterans and a relative rookie, from the beginning of the 2003 tour to the end, interviewing them in their homes with their wives and in their cars en route to matches.
While bad boy Pete Weber traces his lineage to legendary Hall of Fame bowler father Dick, Walter Ray Williams Jr. demonstrates his perfect horseshoe-pitching form (he holds six horseshoe world championships along with his 36 bowling titles). Meanwhile, 20-time bowling champ Wayne Webb now struggles to make the cut, and Chris Barnes, new father of twin boys and winner of three titles, chokes in the big games, uncertain if he can support his growing family.
Brilliantly interpolated clips from TV shows like "Married With Children" or films like the Farrelly brothers' "Kingpin" don't look out of place in the low-rent reality of tour stops sponsored by Odor Eaters.
The PBA's Miller explains to the players that bowling draws a larger television audience than hockey yet generates less than half the ad revenue.
Abrasive and single-minded, Miller -- an ex-Detroit Lion who made his name in global marketing at Nike -- has little interest in the bowlers or the sport; his sole focus is on the visual impact the matches deliver on TV. Seeking out human interest and manufactured pizzazz, Miller promotes the flamboyant style of Pete Weber over solid but stolid athletes like Williams. Somewhat overwhelmed by the pressures inherent in their mandated makeovers, the players quickly peg Browne and his crew as confidants.
Dramatic entrances, revved-up rivalries and a big buildup to the Tournament of Champions inject unconvincing hype into the newly ESPN-televised proceedings: While Pete Weber's signature "crotch chop" hand gesture quickly finds a following, Williams' lame thumb's-up looks like the unfamiliar hand signal of an insecure alien.
Yet the new window dressing eventually manages to underscore the inherent drama of the sport. The ultimate championship bowl-off is a down-to-the-10th-frame squeaker of a grudge match featuring the same rivals -- Weber and Williams -- as ABC's final 1997 broadcast, and the docu participates fully in the nail-biting suspense.
Among its other delights, pic is jauntily shot, edited and scored.

Once a legitimate ratings contender, professional bowling now ranks somewhere between the National Hockey League and competitive basket weaving in the American spectator-sport consciousness. Christopher Browne 's entertaining A League of Ordinary Gentlemen   goes behind the scenes of the Professional Bowlers Association 's comeback bid following the league's 2000 sale (for a mere $5 million) to a trio of retired Microsoft  execs.
Players and pundits offer explanations for the sport's declining reputation: class snobbery, the ongoing "privatization of leisure time," outdated marketing strategies, the movie Kingpin . There's a brief glance back to bowling's Wide World of Sports  heydaydistilled into a montage of vintage TV clips featuring mulleted bowlersbut the bulk of League  focuses on the 2002-03 PBA season. After a few flourishes of Errol Morris -like editing, first-timer Browne settles into a tone resembling the ESPN  telecasts so crucial to the PBA's revenue stream, thriving on the intrinsic drama of competition and the league's emerging star system.
The biggest star of both league and film is the sport's designated bad boy, the hard-partying Pete Weber  (son of the late PBA legend Dick Weber ), seen here bowling with sunglasses and celebrating strikes with his patented "crotch chop" move. Formerly anathema to the PBA, such antics are tacitly encouraged by flamboyant new CEO Steve Miller . An ex-Nike sports marketer hired to revitalize the PBA's image, Miller provides the movie's highlight with a hilarious Patton -like pre-season address to the players ("Either we're in this together or you can kiss my ass"). Combining an aggressive (and ultimately successful) approach to attracting new fans and sponsors with an attitude of utter contempt for his players, Miller's management style suggests that the PBA might already have more in common with the major sports leagues than previously thought.
