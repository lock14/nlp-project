In a last-ditch effort to lure back her unfaithful husband, Mary Haines (Ryan) tries on high-end lingerie at a Manhattan boutique, only to discover that the mistress of the damned dirty cheating husband is slipping on unmentionables in the adjacent dressing room. Mary�s best friend, Sylvia (Bening), urges her to go over and confront the tart. �What do you think this is,� Mary snips back, �some kind of 1930s movie?� The moment is meant as an in-joke � The Women
 is a remake of the 1939 George Cukor film of the same name � but really it�s just a depressing reminder of everything this 2008 reboot is not. It�s not particularly fun, or funny, for starters. Sure, it shares the same gimmick (no men allowed), but it�s a low-rent substitute for the razzle-dazzle cast of the original (Rosalind Russell! Joan Crawford! Joan Fontaine! Paulette Goddard! Hell, even Hedda Hopper!). Certainly, Cukor�s The Women
 was of its time � these were society wives, bored and manicured and possessing of a small army of hired help. Tweaks would need to be made to modernize the thing, and director English has had 13 years in development hell with the project to bring it up to 21st century code. Well, Mary�s still a society wife, but now she�s overworked (poor thing only has two helpmates on staff). Her close coterie of friends includes a lesbian writer (Pinkett Smith, horribly hammy), a stay-at-home mom (Messing), and best friend Sylvia, an editor at a women�s magazine fighting tooth and nail not to lose her job to her younger, fitter, more cutthroat competition. The role of Sylvie comes the closest in spirit to English�s most famous creation, that of TV�s Murphy Brown � both single, unsentimental, piss-and-vinegar power players � but it�s disheartening, to say the least, that English�s former, admirable body blows at the culture wars have been downgraded to this confused seesaw between condemnation and celebration of plastic surgery. There, I said it. Usually, I�m loath to comment on an actress� physical appearance, but there�s simply no way of avoiding it with Meg Ryan. I won�t pretend to understand the pressures attendant to aging in Hollywood, and there are no doubt legions of gorgeous women in the industry who, having acquired lines and soft sags, as all women do, have had work done. Most of those tucks and sucks and lifts and line-erasings we don�t know about. But on a few occasions, the transformation is so significant as to be surreal, and such is the case with Ryan. She�s always had a loosey-goosey, childlike quality to her mannerisms, and they were charming. Paired now, however, with a face off a factory line, Ryan�s screen presence has become a parody of its former self, and the effect is so off-putting that I lost whole stretches of the film to pure distraction. By the time her character has a sit-down with her post-op mother, face swathed in the tell-tale bandages of a new lift and played � egads! � by that onetime warrior for the single working mom, Candice Bergen, my mind was sufficiently blown. This
 is girl power? I�ll not
 have what she�s having, thank you very much, and I�m thinking about amassing a small army of my own to demand as much.


You should start to worry about "The Women" in the first two minutes. Lots of shots of women's legs in expensive shoes come hurtling toward us. We don't get many arms, shoulders, backs, or, God forbid, personalities. Instead, our first close-up is of two sniping dogs.
If Diane English meant to set the tone with a jab of symbolic satire, maybe she could have cast the whole movie with house pets. Instead, she wrangles human stars for her remake of Clare Boothe Luce's manless 1936 play about a troupe of rich New York women - here, Annette Bening, Debra Messing, and Jada Pinkett-Smith - who sic themselves on the mistress (Eva Mendes) of their friend's husband. As the wronged friend, Mary, Meg Ryan trudges through the movie powered on maximum-cute righteousness. Her spunk accessorizes nicely with the cha-cha-cha music on the soundtrack.
Luce's play was dipped in acid, and the film George Cukor made of it in 1939 was a barbed fashion show -cattiness and glamour. Neither is the riot it must have been all those years ago, but you could see the mockery both wanted to make of rich ladies with too much time on their hands. English has spent years trying to get her remake off the ground. For any number of reasons (many to do with casting), it kept not happening. Now that it's here you have to wonder why she ever fought so hard to see it through.
For one thing, the movie is a work of ambivalence. Is English making fun of these women? Or is she making a pilot for Lifetime? It's hard to tell. Bening's character, the endangered editor of a stagnating women's magazine, is the most sensible of everybody and exhibits what wit the movie has. But within minutes of our meeting her, she enters a Saks Fifth Avenue, and as she eyes the merchandise the screen goes green with a military readout that may as well be from "Predator." We have a bionic shopper on our hands.
Ryan, meanwhile, is all her usual pouts, quirks, whines, and crinkled faces. She's now like a Meg Ryan impersonator. English has given the impersonation all the trimmings, too - galoshes, sundresses, endless golden hair to toss out of her face, a garden to tend while talking on her cellphone, an SUV to climb out of, a giant dog to go bounding around her Connecticut house. Eventually, Mary finds the only trimming that matters: self-empowerment. After the humiliation of a messy public divorce, she straightens her hair (I'd call the new cut Chewbacca Barbie, but you decide) and attempts to make her fashion dreams come true with what can only be described as designer nursewear.
The movie's lightness seems forced to the point of being unbearable: See, girls really do just wanna have fun - and babies and faithful husbands and meaningful careers and anything by Narciso Rodriguez. But glibness doesn't become English - not the woman whose sitcom "Murphy Brown" gave us Candice Bergen as the intelligent symbol of working womanhood and laughed respectfully at the myth of having it all. Now Bergen is playing Ryan's cosmetically altered mother in "The Women" and looking none too thrilled to be. Bette Midler arrives too briefly to make funny faces and a stab at wisdom. But the movie is afraid of gender politics (although Messing's chronically pregnant character might excite Sarah Palin fans) and oblivious to issues of class: Boy, women in the service industry are annoying.
You have to wonder whether shows like "Designing Women" and "Sex and the City," and the shallow movie it produced, long ago obviated the need for a remake of "The Women." Besides it's often less George Cukor or, for that matter, Pedro Almodóvar and more "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants."
Whenever I wanted to give English the benefit of the doubt, somebody burned a tampon or went on a yoga retreat. Her filmmaking undermines her credibility. This is never more true than when Messing's water breaks and Bening, Pinkett-Smith, and Ryan hyperventilate by her side in the delivery room. Ryan's on the phone. Pinkett-Smith is shoving ice cubes into her mouth and pretending to pass out. Everyone screams while the camera swings like a runaway yo-yo. I wanted something I never thought I would: an epidural.


The 1939 MGM classic The Women  was the original Sex and the City  . It had everything: gossip and fashion shows and spa workouts, plus a peek into the dishy manners of New York high society. Directed by George Cukor, from a script by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin (which was adapted from Claire Boothe Luce's Broadway smash), the movie was a zinger-strewn orgy of feminine camaraderie and backbiting, yet it also confronted the timeless issue of whether a happy marriage can  and should  survive an adulterous affair. The Women  wasn't by any means a great movie, but it had a polished acid vibrance and, for all its over-the-top chatter, an elegantly simple story.
The new version, written and directed by former Murphy Brown  writer-producer Diane English, sprawls all over the place, in no small part because it's trying so hard to be a luscious retrograde fantasy and a tale of 21st-century empowerment. Meg Ryan , her hair so mega-permed it looks as if she were hiding under the world's most expensive mop, takes the Norma Shearer role: She's Mary Haines, a wealthy Connecticut housewife whose world collapses when she learns  from a blabby Saks Fifth Avenue manicurist (Debi Mazar )  that her husband has been sleeping with the golddigger who works at the perfume counter. (This floozy is played by Eva Mendes , sexy-vicious where Joan Crawford was sexy-psychotic.) Annette Bening , in the Rosalind Russell role of Mary's treacherous best friend, is now a women's magazine editor, which means that once you've adjusted to how badly Bening has been lit, the film can get sidetracked into one of those awesomely unconvincing inside views of how New York media supposedly work.
Meanwhile, Ryan's Mary reacts to her predicament by experiencing a career-minded awakening (I can be a fashion designer! Because I believe in myself! ), which feels like the sort of thing we watched Diane Keaton  go through in bad comedies 20 years ago. Nattering around the edges are Debra Messing  as a busybody and walking advertisement for the joys of child rearing, Jada Pinkett Smith  as a sullen author, and Bette Midler  as some weird Mae West noodge of a bat-brained divorcée. For added relevance, Mary's daughter (India Ennenga) has been made into a compendium of up-to-the-minute girl crises. The Women  is such an arduous patchwork of ''issues'' it ends up a Frankenstein's monster of a chick flick. The movie is a feminist lesson instead of what it should have been (and once was): a tough, synthetic, high-gloss entertainment that wears its heart on its lacquered fingernails.
More on The Women :  The Women : The making of a movie in no man&#39;s land

 “What is this, some 1930s movie?” asks a character in “The Women.” If only! Of course, the line pays winking homage to a specific ’30s movie, directed by George Cukor and based on a notorious play by Clare Boothe Luce, that starred Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford and was also called “The Women.”  Further comparison would only serve to demean that sleek and waspish artifact of a bygone era, and also to humiliate the remake, a witless, straining mess written and directed by Diane English, the creator of “Murphy Brown.” Watching it, you wait in vain for a moment of snappy repartee, of fresh emotion, of grace or charm or pathos. You wait, by the way, for a very long time — two hours that pass like the whole 13-episode jump-the-shark season of a series on basic cable — and what you get is Meg Ryan munching on a stick of butter dipped in cocoa powder as she rants and raves to her au pair (Tilly Scott Pedersen) and her maid (Cloris Leachman) about the sorry state of her life.  And that’s the best scene in the movie. At least it gives Ms. Ryan, who otherwise has to oscillate between ditzy and mopey, a chance to remind us that she is still the spitfire who won America’s heart when she faked an orgasm at Katz’s Deli. In “The Women,” she certainly works at faking something — pluck? distress? belief in the script? — but table-pounding ecstasy, or even simple, modest pleasure, is beyond this movie’s range.  Ms. Ryan plays Mary Haines, part of a circle of friends that includes Edie (Debra Messing), Alex (Jada Pinkett Smith) and, supremely, Annette Bening as Sylvie. One of the film’s clever conceits, borrowed from the original, is that it entirely banishes men. And yet, far from liberating the women from male domination, this trick serves only to emphasize their dependence on the caprices of patriarchal authority. The invisible men in “The Women” wield an almost mystical power.  Only Alex, a lesbian and a celebrated essayist, is immune, but she disappears for much of the movie (lucky her). Edie, meanwhile, is pregnant for the fifth time, while the never-married Sylvie, a magazine editor with crisp suits and a posture of easy, confident command, lives in constant fear of being fired by her male publisher. Mary, in spite of the energy with which she devotes herself to work, family, cooking, gardening and everything else, is employed by her father and, it turns out, at the mercy of her philandering stockbroker husband.  “Sex and the City,” where plenty of men hang around and have speaking parts, was able, on the big screen but especially on television, to create and maintain an autonomous space of female friendship. However big they might have been, the dudes knew their place, which was at the margin of the charmed circle of Carrie, Samantha, Miranda and Charlotte. Here, the fathers and husbands cast a longer, darker shadow. While it’s possible that this is Ms. English’s point, it’s one that contradicts and ultimately makes incoherent her celebration of female self-sufficiency and solidarity.  Really, though, muddled sexual politics are not the main problem. If “The Women” had managed to give its various impulses some kind of coherent shape or tone, it might be worth arguing about. As it is, the movie wanders and wallows, stumbling toward screwball before veering in the direction of weepiness and grasping at satirical urbanity along the way.  At the heart of the hectic story is Mary’s discovery that her husband is having an affair with Crystal (Eva Mendes), a gold-digging vixen who works at the perfume counter at Saks Fifth Avenue. The strain of top-down class resentment in the way her character is portrayed — mean, selfish, cheap and vulgar — is perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie, and also, perhaps, the most honest. At bottom, this is less a movie about defending a marriage or battling for a man than it is about the protection of social privilege. Out in the suburbs, the loyal servants stand by their mistress (and seem to have no private lives or desires of their own), while in the city the lower orders scheme and gossip and connive to steal what can never be rightfully theirs.  And of course, the heroic women of “The Women” will not concede without a fight. But rarely has class struggle, or catfighting, for that matter, been so tediously waged. And rarely have so many fine actresses been enlisted in such a futile cause. They all deserved better, and it hurts especially to watch Ms. Bening and Candice Bergen (who plays Mary’s mother) lend their wit and dignity to a project that has so little of its own.  “The Women” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual references and some strong language.

A cheating husband, a backstabbing best friend and more estrogen than an Emily's List fundraiser may have struck B.O. gold for "The Women" back in 1939, but prospects for this pseudo-feisty remake feel iffy at best today. True to the original, Diane English's 21st-century spin features a strict no-boys policy, though she does little to update the material to the modern world. Like being locked in a closet full of cats, the old-fashioned all-girl scenario ensures the screen isn't the only place men will be missing. Female interest should be strong, but don't expect "Sex and the City"-size turnouts.
English ("Murphy Brown") has rounded up as diverse a cast as possible, as if hoping each actress will snare a different demo. There's Annette Bening as a Kim Cattrall-style 
career girl, Meg Ryan playing handy housewife to a Wall Street tycoon, Debra Messing as a perpetually pregnant baby-maker and Jada Pinkett Smith representing multiple minorities as their Sapphic soul sister. After asking auds to believe in such a mismatched sorority, the screenplay bends over backward to keep men out, examining their behavior in girls-only habitats, from fat farms and garden parties to lingerie stores and lesbian 
bars.
Pic slavishly preserves key plot points from the original, however anachronistic they seem in the modern world. It all starts when a blabbermouth manicurist at Saks Fifth Avenue spills the beans that the vixen behind the perfume counter (played by Eva Mendes) has landed a new sugar daddy, not realizing the rumor will soon get back to the man's wife, Mary Haines (Ryan).
In Clare Boothe Luce's original play, that bit of news catalyzes a storm of backstabbing and one-upswomanship among a close-knit circle of upper-crust dames -- the perfect fodder for biting social satire -- but English isn't out for blood. Here, the news brings the group of friends even closer together as they advise Mary on whether she should leave her (unseen) husband or confront the hussy who stole her man.
Bening plays Sylvie, the editor of struggling beauty magazine Cachet -- essentially a watered-down Miranda Priestly. When one of her assistants pitches an all-revenge issue, Sylvie dismisses the idea as outmoded. Indeed, this reimagining of "The Women" is less about getting even than about inspiring that same mushy sense of female empowerment you might find in a Tyler Perry meller, complete with manic mood swings and full-blown diva moments.
But even there, English struggles trying to create the kind of feel-good experience that seems to come so naturally to femme helmers like Nancy Meyers and Nora Ephron. This isn't one of those instant chick-flick classics that will draw viewers back in every time they come across it channel-surfing. Much of the behavior feels unnatural (there's a funny bit in which Mary binges on a stick of butter after kicking her husband out of the house, but other gags simply don't work), and there's just no reconciling the movie's preoccupation about Botox and facelifts with the heavily doctored appearances of its leading ladies.
Confounding the matter even further is the involvement of Dove, an extension of the company's "Campaign for Real Beauty" and an example of new horizons in product placement. Sylvie not only uses Dove lotion but also finds it romantic that Mary's philandering husband describes his wife as smelling like soap.
Messing and Pinkett Smith have very limited screentime; cameo appearances by Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher and Bette Midler (as well as newcomer India Ennenga as Mary's daughter) get nearly as much play as these two underwritten members of the movie's central sisterhood. Ryan and Bening fare better: Bening's right at home in the skin of a working professional, recalling aspects of her perf in "The American President," while Ryan exudes much the same no-nonsense charm of her "When Harry Met Sally" days. Neither role is a stretch, but they play to both actresses' strengths.
English's most significant improvement on the original is her point that a "breakup" between best girlfriends sets everybody back even more than any cheating husband could. She also cooks up a far better justification for the movie's big fashion show. On the fashion front, "The Women" delivers from head to toe. Opening montage introduces all the characters by their signature footwear, and auds even get two Ryan hairstyles for the price of one (though like the performance, both are variations on earlier roles).
Music choices aren't such a good fit, with Mark Isham's jazzy score making this estrogen fest feel a bit frenzied in the spaces between Chris Douridas' mostly forgettable pop-tune picks. A signature song would've gone a long way to remind auds that these four incredibly different women have a lot more than man trouble in common.
