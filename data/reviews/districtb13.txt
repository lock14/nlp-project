Morel is the latest Luc Besson prot�g� to make the leap to director with this breakneck-paced action movie, which was conceived and co-scripted by Besson (La Femme Nikita)
. Set in the near-future of 2010, the film is not big on plot exposition, instead focusing on its finely wrought action momentum, which moves ever forward with rushing exhilaration. The city of Paris has erected isolation walls around the core city to protect its citizens from the chaos of the suburban ghettos, which in turn are controlled by warring gangs. The biggest and the baddest of the gangs is headed by Taha (Naceri, who also co-scripted under the name Bibi Naceri), a reprehensible figure who'd just as soon shoot his own soldiers as listen to their excuses. Leito (Belle), who appears to be the last righteous man in his suburban ghetto District B13, is a constant thorn in the side of Taha, outrunning his henchmen and destroying his drug stockpiles. The film's lengthy opening chase sequence is devoted to Leito's latest escapade, and dazzles due to the actor's virtuosic ability to leap across buildings and rooftops, through transoms, and over the various concrete impediments of the urban jungle. (Belle's athletic talent stems from his background as one of the founders of the sport of Parkour, which combines running and martial-arts moves for total mobility in an urban environment.) Leito's attempt at cleaning up the neighborhood is cruelly rewarded with a prison sentence and the capture of his sister (Chattot), who is drugged by Taha and kept on a dog leash at his feet. He's sprung from prison when he's paired up with the veteran elite-forces cop Damien (Raffaelli, a professional stuntman-turned-actor), who is assigned to deactivate a wayward nuclear bomb that has fallen into Taha's hands. Leito joins on to rescue his sister. There's a minimal amount of dialogue and a constant propulsive techno score (produced by Da Octopuss) as District B13
 moves along its action-centered trajectory. Implications regarding the recent riots among French immigrant youth and a cautionary vibe about the trustworthiness of the nation's leaders and law enforcers can be drawn � although they're mild enough to also be wholly ignored. This French import is a worthy entrant into the adrenalized cadre of action films like Run Lola Run
 and Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior
 (which Besson produced). What District B13
 lacks in story development it compensates for with stunningly realistic action.


It's not my preferred way to go, but were I to die chasing a shirtless thug in a French action movie, I'd want to do it with all my might, like the anonymous goons in ``District B13." When a body plummets down a stairwell or is hurled against a slot machine, it does so with conviction. Like its stunt work, the movie is both ridiculously hyperactive and a muscular feat of absolute confidence. I don't expect to have a more adrenalizing time at the movies this summer.
Directed by Pierre Morel and co-written by Luc Besson, ``District B13" comes on as the latest glorification of thug life. The year is 2010 and the setting is B13, a vast Brutalist slum on the outskirts of Paris (the high-rise projects in France are called ``cités"), where the lithe, tattooed, and serious Leito (David Belle) is on the run from a drug dealer looking for his suitcase full of cocaine. The dealer (Tony D'Amario) is a hill of a man, rightly named K2. He's the sort of fellow who sends his underlings scrambling up the stairs after Leito while he takes the elevator.
The camerawork in these sequences is jumpy. It follows a joint flicked down the garbage chute and climbs over junkies clogging the housing project corridors. We get it: Morel digs scuzz. But on the run, the picture makes a sudden, jaw-dropping announcement. The cats chasing Leito may be fast, but Leito is no mortal mouse. He's a practitioner of parkour , a French street sport that combines speed and acrobatics in an explosive and graceful way. It looks spectacular when timed with pulsing hip-hoppy electronica by laser-sharp editing. The sport is also a practical exercise -- perfect for running from the cops, say. But like South Central's krump craze or British grime, parkour's urban desperation explodes into kinetic art. It's Cirque du Cité.
Without any apparent visual assistance, Leito leaps off rooftops and sails, feet first, through a transom window. I would have gasped at that last stunt, but before I could muster the air, Morel and his crew had moved on to the next trick, which is two seconds away. Belle helped create parkour, and watching him climb along walls and scurry down the sides of buildings, you might be tempted to alert the makers of ``X-Men." At the very least, he makes Spider-Man look like a potato bug. Eventually, Leito is nabbed and jailed, but it's only to give him a rest.
While he takes a breather, we're introduced to Damien (Cyril Raffaelli), an equally compact blond, with a receding hairline. After months of being deep undercover -- his wig, attitude, and flashy duds have earned him a spot as a thug's main henchman -- he takes part in one of the more hilarious crime busts I've seen. (One of the baddies is like Al Pacino's Scarface doing Pacino's Richard III: grotesquely funny.) When the job goes wrong, Damien is forced to reveal that he, too, can hurt people with ruthless grace.
That the screenwriters cook up a reason for the punk and the cop to team up, albeit with extreme reluctance, should go without saying. But the chefs are inspired. A powerful rocket has fallen into the hands of B13's drug lords. It could obliterate the entire housing complex, and Damien has 24 hours to enter the complex and defuse it. Obviously, Leito is the only man who can get him near it. This pairing produces one intense debate (who is the law for, anyway?), two hilarious observations (for example, ``Your moves reek of cop school!"), and a few occasions for neck-breaking pas de deux.
Raffaelli is the film's fight choreographer (he was trained in the circus and also did the eye-popping stunts in the first ``Transporter" film), and he has saved some of the most interesting sequences for his work with Belle. They have physical chemistry that's fraternal (like the Nicholas Brothers) and vaguely sexual (like Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor).
But fancy feet aside, ``District B13" is a movie of its moment. The housing project here is compared by one character to Baghdad, but it could double as Beirut or the South Bronx. The checkpoints at the entrance and the soldiers guarding them give the place a West Bank feel. As a metaphor for new-school government policy regarding the poor, the film's last act is beyond absurd -- but not really when you listen closely to how, during last year's riots in France, the muckety-mucks absolved themselves from any responsibility for the catastrophe.
Remarkably, the film keeps a lid on its anger over the cités until the finale, which manages to shake its fists at the government in a manner that produces the thrill not only of catharsis but of truth. Suddenly, the film's generic title seems appropriate. B13 could be anywhere.

         The energetic but dopey French action saga "District B13" features an intriguing blend of martial arts and parkour
, the recent street phenomenon that involves bounding through urban spaces at high speed, jumping from rooftops and acrobatically avoiding any obstacles that may impede your progress. Martial artist Cyril Raffaelli and parkour
 specialist David Belle play an idealistic cop and jailed vigilante who are teamed by the government to break into Paris' most notorious, walledoff suburb and retrieve a wayward nuclear device in the year 2010.
 
 More athletes than actors, Raffaelli and Belle are terrific when their bodies are in motion but the movie grinds to a halt when they open their mouths. The typically moronic plot simply gets in the way of what might have been a super-ambitious sneaker commercial.
 


         






   Things have gotten so bad in banlieue
 13 — the Paris suburb referred to in the title — that officials have turned it into a de facto prison zone. The schools and public services have all closed down and as the last police precinct pulls out, the hyper-gymnastic Leïto (Belle) defiantly destroys a local drug lord's cache of heroin. The kingpin, Taha (Bibi Naceri, who also co-scripted), gets revenge by kidnapping Leïto's sister Lola (Dany Verissimo) and forcing a corrupt police officer to throw Leïto in the slammer.
 
 On the outside, Damien (Raffaelli), a kickboxing undercover super-cop with flashy guns to match his fast feet, takes down a Latino gangster's gambling establishment single-handedly. He's immediately recruited for the dangerous assignment of tracking down the rogue nuke that has fallen into the hands of the dastardly Taha.
 
 Damien's first task is to go undercover as a fellow prisoner and help Leïto escape. Leïto's motivation to help Damien with Taha is Lola, whom Taha has strung out on drugs and leads around on a dog leash.
 
 Produced and co-written by Luc Besson, "District" is a lot less fun than his similar "Transporter" films. Raffaelli and Belle lack the gruff charm Jason Statham displayed in those movies, which, in general, move so quickly the audience doesn't have time to dwell on how dumb they are. Director Pierre Morel (a cinematographer who worked on both "Transporter" films) capably films Raffaelli and Belle displaying their action chops but is unable to do anything with the tediousness of the uninspired script. See it if you must, but if you're simply curious about parkour
, you'd be better served searching for some of Belle's videos on the web. "Rush Hour," a commercial for BBC One, is particularly entertaining.

Leave it to the French to resurrect the Great White Martial Artist. And in District B13 , this Luc Besson-hatched action flick, we get two: Leito (David Belle) and Damien (Cyril Raffaelli), mismatched badasses who have to extract a WMD from a nasty futuristic Parisian ghetto. The big innovation here is that the two nimble leads, stuntmen-turned-stars, are devotees of parkour, a fancy French word for the fluid use of urban environments as jungle gyms. And while the fight scenes do carry a nifty charge, parkour itself isn't quite revolutionary: Jackie Chan's been doing the same thing for 20 years.

   At the whirling-dervish center of the French action film "District B13" is a fighting discipline known as parkour. I'm pretty sure that's French for "somersaulting over balconies while drop-kicking the gangsters who kidnapped your sister and turned her into a junkie." However it translates, parkour isn't par-for-the-course movie mayhem, but a gorgeously choreographed gymnastics of pain that elevates "District B13" over the impossible missions and last stands of the season.  Cyril Raffaelli stars, deliciously shirtless, as Damien, a righteous denizen of the grungy Parisian suburb District B13. By  2010  crime, misery and hairstyles have grown so extreme that the authorities have shuttered the schools, withdrawn the police and sealed off the district with a fortified wall. Lording over it all is the sneering, cocaine-addled crime boss Taha (Bibi Naceri), who doesn't take kindly to Damien's flushing a million Euros worth of his dope down the drain.  Complications ensue when a massive government bomb finds its way into the slum. Enter Leïto (David Belle), a supercop with shaved armpits sent to retrieve the activated weapon. Teaming up with Damien, he vaults into the fray, only to discover that his noble mission may be a nefarious bourgeois plot to eradicate the lower classes. Spectacular set pieces and reductive politics follow.  With backing from the film's producer and co-writer, Luc Besson, the director, Pierre Morel, mounts a breakneck B movie inspired by Hong Kong action extravaganzas, the gritty genre classics of John Carpenter and the Thai neo-kung fu parable "Ong Bak." He hasn't reinvented this particular wheel, but he gets it spinning with delirious savoir-faire.

Heavy artillery, sheer physical dexterity and down-to-the-wire suspense mix well in "Banlieue 13," a message-based actioner that's fast, dumb fun. Although some local crix have dismissed pic as a poor copy of John Carpenter's "Escape From New York," word-of-mouth should point to decent biz for Luc Besson-spawned venture in which a principled guy from the projects and a principled undercover cop unite to disarm a purloined neutron bomb before it obliterates 2 million people.
Basic premise has a painless subtext that should resonate without roiling the target aud: The rule of law is way cooler than the way of the gun. And -- oh, yeah -- if you're a member of a disenfranchised underclass, try not to let the authorities build a wall around your neighborhood.
It's 2010 and the government has erected concrete barriers around the hard-to-handle suburbs near Paris ("banlieue" is the French word for 'burb). As a public service, spunky local lad Leito is busy destroying 20 kilos of heroin in the bathtub of his tower-block apartment when very armed, very menacing reps of local Scarface-like kingpin Taha (Larbi Naceri, who also co-scripted under the moniker Bibi Naceri) come looking for him. Leito -- played by the more-Spiderman-than-thou David Belle of "Yamakasi" fame -- escapes in a thrilling series of muscular stunts that call for him and his shock-absorbing knees to treat high-rise concrete structures and rooftops like well-placed trampolines.
In retaliation, Taha sends his baddies to kidnap Leito's feisty sister, Lola (Dany Verissimo). Taha is not a nice man: Lola is soon strung out on heroin and kept on a dog leash at his feet while Leito does form-preserving sit-ups in prison.
Meanwhile, in a terrific prolonged set piece, undercover cop Damien (martial arts ace Cyril Raffaelli) captures a sleazy Latino crime boss and shuts down his illicit casino, against very stacked odds. Damien's reward is an assignment that's as delicate as it is seemingly impossible: Penetrate notorious Suburb 13 and stop the accidentally triggered countdown on a deadly bomb that was hijacked by Taha.
Narrative skeleton is derivative and formulaic but rarely feels that way thanks to bullet pacing, nifty choreography and a few well-placed rejoinders. Much of pic was lensed in Romania where the menacing bad guys must have come from Ugly Suckers R Us. For once, the vidgame-cum-comic book atmosphere is just plausible enough to make suspension of disbelief a pleasure instead of an intelligence-insulting chore.
Belle and Raffaelli were born to get out of filmic tight spots on short notice together -- their sinewy moves and martial arts maneuvers are consistently fun to watch and there's next to no expository dead air between action sequences.
Pic contains nothing groundbreaking or eternal but viewers should leave entertained instead of worn out.

For the twin offenses of being French and not starring Tom Cruise , District B13 a fanboy mash-up of John Carpenter 's greatest hits, brought to you by the Luc Besson  laboratoriesis getting exiled to the art house ghetto. Spread the word: This delirious import is the most (maybe the only) fun action movie of the summerswift, funny, filled with actual stunts instead of digitized mayhem, and primed at a moment's notice for megaton ass-kicking. Set in 2010 Paris, it fuses Escape From New York 's futuristic city-as-prison concept with Assault on Precinct 13 's bristling political subtext, as an undercover cop (Cyril Raffaelli ) and a convict (David Belle ) battle their way through a walled-in underclass banlieue searching for a massive "clean bomb." The plot is mostly straight-to-video silliness, except for a final kicker that feeds off the real-life unrest seething in Paris's strife-torn suburbs. But Bellea master of parkour, the French extreme sport/martial art devoted to the casual hurdling of physical obstaclesbrings an exhilarating athleticism to the many chases and fights. I'd trade all of M:i:III 's 126 minutes for one 1.7-second shot of Belle hurtling himself in a single motion through a locked door's transom.
