It�s a rare movie that can be summed up by a throwaway line spoken by one of its throwaway characters. But for the life of me, I can�t think of a better way to describe Soul Men
 than to say it�s about two men who, as one supporting player puts it, �say �motherfucker� a lot.� Louis Hinds (Jackson) and Floyd Henderson (Mac) do say �motherfucker� a lot � mainly in anger, mainly at each other, and always with the baroque eloquence most actors save for Shakespeare � but Jackson and Mac have mastered in service of the more low-down arts. In their defense, Hinds and Henderson have a lot to curse about. Thirty years ago, they were back-up singers in a top-selling soul trio called Marcus Hooks & the Real Deal (fronted, in �historical� newsreel footage, by real-life top-selling soul singer John Legend). Then Hooks left to start a solo career, make millions, and become a pop hero, leaving his two former partners to slip slowly into obscurity and depression and, in Hinds� case, a life of crime and poverty. Flash forward to the present day: Hooks has died, a star-studded tribute concert is being arranged in his honor at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, and Hinds and Hooks, who haven�t spoken in years and whose dancing and singing abilities have been diminished by the forces of time and disuse, are on their way to New York to grab a little bit of the celebrity life back for themselves before their time is up. Along the way, they engage in all manner of cheap Hollywood preposterousness � including a ridiculous line-dance set-piece in an Amarillo honky-tonk and a jailbreak that makes the Memphis Police Department look about as capable as Roscoe P. Coltrane from The Dukes of Hazzard
 TV show � straining the boundaries of narrative plausibility as they go and gradually becoming less and less funny as their bitterness gets the better of them. Soul Men
, in other words, is pure mediocrity. It�s poorly written and poorly directed (a subplot involving a young woman and her drug-dealing, rapping, no-good boyfriend doesn�t help). But, thankfully for everyone involved, the movie always has Mac and Jackson and their filthy mouths to fall back on. Whenever Soul Men
 is in need of a jolt of energy, these two poets of profanity are always ready with rapid-fire, mean-spirited rants that would make the writers of Deadwood
 blush. Believe what you want about the moral implications of dirty language, but in Jackson�s and Mac�s capable hands, �motherfucker� sounds like sweet soul music.


There are two reasons to put up with "Soul Men," and that's the soul men themselves. Samuel L. Jackson and Bernie Mac appear to be having a good time, and for most of this raunchy, poorly orchestrated buddy comedy, that's enough.
Neither actor comes to mind when you think '60s doo-wop, '70s R&B, or '80s funk, so asking Jackson and Mac to croon, swing, and do the robot is shrewd. Their physical smoothness and strong voices are surprising, like seeing your uncles do an ancient but timeless routine at the family-reunion talent show.
Unfortunately, the routine is attached to a plot. Jackson is Louis Hinds, and Mac is Floyd Henderson, and back in the day, they were the Real Deal, side singers for the crooner Marcus Hooks (John Legend). After the group split up, Hooks achieved solo superstardom, turning from Smokey Robinson to George Clinton to John Legend in bad old-age makeup. Failing to capitalize on their one hit single, Louis turned to bank robbery, and Floyd opened a chain of car washes.
They haven't seen each other since an acrimonious falling out. In the intervening years, Louis has corn-rowed his hair and carries a gun; Floyd has replaced his hip. When a VH-1 tribute to Marcus occasions a Real Deal reunion and handsome payday, they're back in each other's lives - and in Floyd's car. Wouldn't you know it: Louis hates to fly. So "Soul Men" swiftly becomes a road-trip movie. Flying from Los Angeles to New York would have put things at 20 minutes. On the road, they can bicker, reminisce, and polish their showbiz rust by performing in biker bars and country-western saloons where the patrons line dance to their songs. They can sleep with white chicks, too.
Yes, after one tune-up show, Mac's eyes meet Jennifer Coolidge's, and the movie's wackiest and most lascivious scenes follow. "Soul Men" is Mac's last film (he died in August), and I didn't realize just how much I would miss him until I saw him wince and cringe beneath Coolidge's buxom bad mamma-jamma. Mac does everything in this scene - pop his eyes, purse his lips, scream, moan, cry. Agony and ecstasy are hilariously indistinguishable.
The crime, of course, is that for most of his career, Mac had to make do with movies not much better than this. Here he's funny despite both the script, which was typed up by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone, and the broad, cartoonish direction by Malcolm D. Lee. "Soul Men" even finds little reason for a cameo by the late Isaac Hayes. That's typical of the movie's confusion. It's a crude satire that wants to tug at the heart, too. In one scene Louis and Floyd are dropping in on the grown daughter (Sharon Leal) of the woman who split up the Real Deal. In the next, they're beating up the idiot drug dealer whose raps sample their music and who arrives at their Memphis stop in half a body cast. Did I mention the nerdy white kid and soul enthusiast from the record company shepherding the Real Deal to New York? There, I did.
Occasionally, inspiration flashes. The opening montage presents the history of Marcus Hooks and the Real Deal in a way that suggests that someone needs to do for soul music what "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" did for country, and "CB4" did for rap. But that setup is misleading, too, since it makes us unsure just how seriously to take Louis and Floyd as performers. The truth is that Jackson and Mac make a pretty wonderful oldies act. Even if the clumsy editing implies stunt doubles are doing some of dancing, in front of a live audience it's tough to dispute that they really are the real deal.


Soul Men , starring Bernie Mac and Samuel L. Jackson as backup singers from the Motown/Stax era who reunite for a concert, is the last feature that Mac  that great, gruff growler (he's the one comedian I can think of who had an imperious twinkle)  completed before his death. That alone made me eager to see it, and so did the subject matter  a look back at the glory days of soul  and also the director, Malcolm D. Lee, who brought a brashly funny and humane touch to The Best Man  (1999) and to the I-love-the-'70s roller-boogie trip Roll Bounce  (2005). But Soul Men , disappointingly, doesn't have that same deft, light touch. It's just another grumpy-old-men grousefest with a gooey center, like The Sunshine Boys  or The Bucket List . Even its musical nostalgia comes off as more concocted than felt. Floyd (Mac), bored to tears in his comfy retirement, and Louis (Jackson), who lost all his money, haven't spoken in years. When their former lead singer dies, they travel cross-country to a tribute gig, polishing their act in cheap lounges on their way to the Apollo Theater. There's yelling, more yelling, a lot  more yelling, and a plastic plot about the woman they both loved. There's also a nice moment in the desert when they rediscover their elegant stage moves. But Soul Men  could have done with less amped-up abrasiveness and more soft-shoe charm.

 “Soul Men” is a raucous, rambling comedy, offering some laughs, some groans and a feast for fans of the musical idioms it mocks and celebrates. It is also something of a bittersweet experience for fans of Isaac Hayes, who has an extended cameo as himself, and Bernie Mac, who plays Floyd Henderson, half of a has-been vocal duo reunited for one last show.  Mr. Hayes and Mr. Mac both died after the movie, directed by Malcolm D. Lee, was shot, and the loss of Mr. Mac, whose time in the pop-culture spotlight was tragically brief, feels especially acute. In a stand-up routine immortalized in Spike Lee’s “Original Kings of Comedy,” Mr. Mac showed he could wring more laughs and more insight out of a single obscenity than anyone since the heyday of Lenny Bruce. And as the star of a network sitcom (“The Bernie Mac Show,” which ran on Fox from 2001 to 2006), he showed that he could be a warm and friendly family man without sacrificing his penchant for provocative, truculent candor.  On television, though, and in the PG-13 movie “Oceans Eleven” and its sequels, Mr. Mac had to curb his tongue. “Soul Men” not only allows him room to explore the nuances and inflections of profanity, but it also pairs him with Samuel L. Jackson (as Louis Hinds, Floyd’s onetime singing partner), certainly no slouch when it comes to wringing poetry out of the blue Anglo-Saxon linguistic heritage.  To say that the chief pleasure of “Soul Men” is watching these two men swear at each other is in no way to sell it short. There is also some hitting and gunplay, but that’s pretty superfluous. Once these guys start yelling at each other, all Mr. Lee really has to do is keep the camera running.  They also sing, which is riskier but still pretty good fun. Louis and Floyd, long estranged, are brought back together by the death of Marcus Hooks (John Legend), the Grammy-winning superstar for whom they sang backup in the old days. Their own careers were less glorious. Louis served a prison sentence, and Floyd cycled through a bunch of marriages before being dumped in a retirement community by his nephew. Marcus’s passing offers them the chance for a comeback, and also the opportunity to explore some road-movie clichés en route from Los Angeles to the Apollo Theater in Harlem.  Along the way they encounter Mr. Hayes and some less interesting, equally familiar stock characters, including a hip-hop thug (Affion Crockett), a doughy white nerd who loves black music (Adam Herschman) and Jennifer Coolidge. They also trip over some unconvincing sentimentality involving Cleo (Sharon Leal), the daughter of a woman both men once loved.  Mostly, though, “Soul Men” is driven by the volatility of Louis and Floyd and by its savvy, affectionate exploration of the history of R&B. The movie’s nostalgia for the old days of soul is playful and relaxed, but — in contrast to, say, the pious and misguided “Dreamgirls” — its grasp of the relevant musical idioms is meticulous. The story is a hectic and haphazard affair, but the soundtrack of well-made soul covers and the cruder music of Mr. Jackson and Mr. Mac’s foulmouthed one-upmanship provide a measure of satisfaction.  “Soul Men” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).  It has some sex scenes and language as rough as the songs are sweet.

What could be written off as an African-American update of �The Sunshine Boys� becomes more poignant due to the deaths of Bernie Mac and Isaac Hayes (who appears briefly as himself) and a closing-credit tribute incorporating an interview with Mac that is, frankly, better than the movie that precedes it. Still, there�s a nice chemistry between Mac and Samuel L. Jackson in this latest variant of the road movie, which contains comedic elements but actually works better as a drama. Sentiment regarding Mac will largely determine turnout, though Jackson fans should savor seeing his lighter side unleashed.
Directed by Malcolm D. Lee (�Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins�) from a script by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone that�s a few rest stops short of a fully mapped-out trip, the opening offers a promising rundown of the main characters� backstory. Louis (Jackson) and Floyd (Mac) were 1970s backup singers to smooth lead man Marcus Hooks (a cameo by singer John Legend) before he split to go solo. The pair went on as a duo for a while before parting over a woman.
Decades later, Floyd is having a difficult time adjusting to retirement after running a successful car wash. Louis, meanwhile, has hit the skids, serving prison time and living in relative squalor. So when Marcus� death offers an opportunity to sing together again at the Apollo Theater in New York, they grudgingly reunite -- though Louis insists they drive from Los Angeles, seemingly less out of fear of flying than apprehension about running out of plot in less than 45 minutes.
A series of episodic interludes in states like Arizona, Texas and Oklahoma ensues, allowing the two old pals plenty of time to snipe at each other, relive past grievances and even meet the beautiful Cleo (Sharon Leal, �Dreamgirls�), a young woman who was apparently conceived right around the time Floyd broke up with her mother. Fortunately, this also affords them an opportunity to work on their rusty Temptations-type act and engage in plenty of free-flowing banter, adding an entirely new array of phrases for those fond of Jackson�s near-unparalleled gift for explosive streams of expletives.
Beyond the language, there are some pretty hard-R scenes of sex, nudity and Viagra (an almost obligatory gag these days whenever the stars are over 50), so bringing the kids isn�t a terrific idea. That raunchiness clashes, however, with the tone of the overly broad supporting characters, including a too-eager intern (Adam Herschman) and Cleo�s hapless, gun-toting boyfriend (Affion Crockett).
The pic does a considerably better job capturing the razzmatazz of �70s soul groups, from the garish outfits to the choreographed dance steps and the first-rate soundtrack. Mac and Jackson also appear to be having a ball doing the musical numbers, which are infectious and, given the comic�s death, warming -- although their energetic efforts can�t fully overcome the thinness of the material.
As for that closing sequence, Mac is shown in various outtakes and off-the-cuff moments cracking up the crew or a crowd of extras and speaking about how much he appreciates his career, saying that he�s determined to �cherish each doggone moment.�
�Soul Men� is by no means a movie to cherish, but along its bumpy road, it manages to hit just enough of the right notes to serve as a respectable coda to Mac�s legacy. 



In Soul Men , actor-comedian Bernie Mac , who passed away in August, plays Floyd Henderson , a present-day car-wash mogul who, back in the 1970s, was an r&b backup singer alongside a fellow named Louis Hinds  (Samuel L. Jackson ). One day, their frontman, Marcus Hooks  (John Legend ), took off on his own, becoming a funk-soul god, leaving Floyd and Louis to part as bitter enemies. Twenty years later, Floyd bursts into Louis's fleabag L.A. apartment with a plan for the two men to drive to New York and perform at a tribute show for Marcus, whose sudden death hasn't exactly wrecked his former band mates. "I'm cryin' the tears of a motherfuckin' clown," Louis declares, and kicks Floyd out. But soon enough, the two are headed cross-country in an El Dorado convertible, bickering, getting stranded, and eventually staging their old act in dive bars. While their singing voices are ragged, the old-school hand gestures and side-shuffle footwork is mighty fine. The film dulls out in the home stretch as screenwriters Robert Ramsey  and Matthew Stone  employ increasingly silly side turns to delay Floyd and Louis's arrival in New York. It could be said, too, that the visual style of director Malcolm Lee  (Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins ) rarely matches the energy of his performers, but no matter: Mac and Jackson carry the show—particularly Mac, who's at his crackly, cranky best here. As swan songs go, Soul Men  is pretty sweet.
