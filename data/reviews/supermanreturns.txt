Because he came first, Superman is our base-model superhero. He's not broody like Batman and he doesn't have emotional acne like Spider-Man. His powers are straight up: flying, X-ray vision, super-strength -- none of this changing the weather nonsense. He stands for truth and justice without any of the winking irony our modern culture demands from a guy wearing a cape.
Superman is Version 1.0.
Which is how Bryan Singer treats him in ``Superman Returns, " the fine pop resurrection opening in theaters tonight. Unlike last year's ``Batman Begins, " this isn't a reinvention of a beloved franchise. It's a renewal, a continuation of what has come before. Singer, the gifted writer-director who made ``The Usual Suspects " and the first two ``X-Men" movies, respects everything about this property except the last two sequels.
He raises Marlon Brando from the dead, casts the actors who played Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane on the 1950s TV series in cameo roles, dedicates the film to Christopher and Dana Reeve , and even dusts off John Williams' s title theme from 1978's ``Superman."
The upshot of all this veneration is a generally thrilling entertainment that's not quite the grand slam you want it to be. ``Superman Returns" travels from Metropolis to the North Pole, from outer space to the ocean's depths, but in the end it feels just a little Smallville . You don't mind terribly, but you're conscious of the missed chance.
How's the new kid, by the way? Good enough so that you don't really notice there is
 a new kid. The role of Superman has to be played by a newcomer -- a known star would bring baggage along -- and like Reeve in 1978, Brandon Routh is tall, dark, handsome, and so sincere as to be faintly comical. The character embodies unadorned decency, and that makes others assume he's a square, especially when he has the Clark Kent glasses on. An actor has to be focused enough and bland enough to make that work, and Routh has both qualifications. He's like Reeve's slightly soulful younger brother; somewhere in the Fortress of Solitude, there's an iPod with James Blunt songs on it.
``Returns" picks up about five years after 1980's ``Superman II" left off. Our hero has been away on extended leave, looking for the remains of his home planet in the depths of space, and the world has finally moved on. Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth with dyed brown tresses and not enough edge) has penned an editorial titled ``Why the World Doesn't Need Superman" and is getting ready to receive a Pulitzer for it.
Then Superman rides a meteor back to his adoptive mother's back yard (Ma Kent being played by dear old Eva Marie Saint ), and we're back in business. Clark gets back his old job at the Daily Planet , Perry White (Frank Langella ) is as ulcerous as ever, and Jimmy Olsen (Sam Huntington ) still looks pre-pubescent. Nothing has changed.
Scratch that. Lois is now a single mom to a sickly little kid named Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu), and she's engaged to Perry's nephew, Richard, a sensitive upper-management type played by James Marsden , of the ``X-Men" movies.
Worse, Lex Luthor is on the loose again, with yet another plan for world domination. This role is always reserved for our slyest current character actor/star: Gene Hackman in 1978 and Kevin Spacey here. Where the former brought a manic, impatient giggle to the proceedings, Spacey just looks magnificently bored. This Luthor knows he's smarter than Superman, and it drives him crazy that he doesn't get the recognition.
The story line in ``Superman Returns" never convincingly gels -- something about Luthor getting hold of magic crystals from the Fortress of Solitude and using them to seed a new continent off the Eastern Seaboard , with a bit of green Kryptonite to keep any stray superheroes at bay. Anyway, Singer is more interested in emotional matters and overall tone. He spends a lot of time re-stoking the flames of Lois and Superman's romance, indulging in a flight over Metropolis that's not so much an improvement over the Reeve/Margot Kidder original as a loving nod to it.
``Superman Returns" even pushes a Christ parallel, thankfully not too hard. Unused footage of Marlon Brando's Jor-El from the 1978 Richard Donner ``Superman" is folded into a Fortress of Solitude scene early on, and the actor's voice keeps popping up throughout, reminding the hero that ``I have sent them you, my only son." (Brando may be God, but this is ridiculous.) This isn't ``The Passion of the Clark, " but it's uncomfortably close.
What's missing from the film is the popcorn exhilaration you get from action scenes that build dynamically throughout a narrative. Mayhem junkies will be happy with an early sequence where Superman stops a plane from nose-diving into a baseball stadium, and there's a funny slow-motion gag that illustrates the impact of a bullet on the hero. (None; what were you expecting?) A scene where one of the subordinate villains steps to a piano and lights into ``Heart and Soul" is so witty you wish there were more of it.
In general, though, the film never quite establishes the necessary momentum. Singer tends to his main characters while stranding gifted talents like Parker Posey (as Luthor's moll) and Kal Penn (as a henchman) on the sidelines, and he springs exactly one big plot surprise and doesn't do much with it. Presumably there'll be a payoff in the next film, but that leaves this one in the lurch.
So it's a good film but not a great one; at the very least, you can tell the people behind ``Superman Returns" have an abiding fondness for this 70-year-old pop myth. They're not hacks, and this isn't ``Superman IV: The Quest for Peace ." Still, you may wonder if a fan's worship can be its own kind of green Kryptonite.


It's touching to think that when Richard Donner's Superman  was released in 1978, the ads could tempt audiences with the line ''You'll believe a man can fly.'' Nearly three decades later, it's hard to find a man in the movies who doesn't fly. Special-effects comic-book fantasy is the atmosphere we breathe, and when you go to see Bryan Singer's Superman Returns , it's with the expectation that you'll believe a man can fly, and also speed through blasts of underground fire, land a crashing airplane, and stop a bullet, in slow motion, with his left eyeball  all of which Superman does, without breaking a supersweat. He's still a sleek marvel of fun, though, even if we now take his powers for granted.
The surprise of Superman Returns  is that it isn't a funky, ambitious conceptual reimagining, like last summer's Batman Begins . This really is  your father's Superman; it re-creates  and updates, though just barely  the universe Donner invented. Opening with the voice of Marlon Brando as he murmurs cosmic gibberish (somewhere, he must be giggling at the way his worst performance keeps getting recycled), the movie then blasts us with those lasery blue ''X-ray vision'' credits, which now look about as eye-popping as a game of Pong. John Williams' theme music has been revived, and so has the crystal-chintz Fortress of Solitude, where Jor-El appears on those Krypton DVDs. Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey), cue-ball-headed and deeply insecure, once again leads a fumbly team of camp thugs as he plots to be the ultimate real estate pig.
And Superman? He's been gone for five years, having left Earth to attend to the tragic remains of his planet. It's never clear why this would take him more than a long weekend, but at a Superman  movie it's best not to spend much time questioning the logic. What matters is that Brandon Routh, the 26-year-old unknown who took on the role that every Hollywood actor with a name turned down, has Christopher Reeve's dimples, streaky eyebrows, prominent nose, and Olympic-gymnast facial planes, and that he plays Superman by unabashedly mimicking Reeve's performance. As the twittery nerd Clark Kent, Routh stammers with mock anxiety, bowing his head as he pushes his glasses up with his index finger, and he's all sexy, straight-staring chivalry as the clear-eyed, rock-chested Superman, a god too noble to be a stud, even when he's coursing through the air with Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) in his arms.
Routh, it must be said, isn't nearly as nimble a comedian as the hulking yet light-footed Reeve, who made Clark a figure of fun, playing up the way this office dweeb was really an actor, and carrying a hint of that amused spark over to his portrayal of Superman as well. Routh, who actually resembles a tall, buff Jason Schwartzman, lacks that authority; he's virtually the same age as Reeve was when Reeve first played the part, but Routh's Superman isn't quite a man  he's closer to an eager adolescent. As Lois, Kate Bosworth, in wavy brown hair and a permanent expression of worry, seems more like a corporate lawyer than a sassy reporter; she's earnest when she should be zestful. Remember the Sunset Boulevard  line about how movie stars used to be  ''We had faces''? At Superman Returns , you watch Routh and Bosworth and remember back to Reeve and Margot Kidder, that witchy-lipped flirt, and you think, They had personalities!
Yet Routh and Bosworth have a puppyish connection that grows on you, and it's tapped by a shrewd romantic story. Superman Returns  expands the love ''triangle'' of Lois/Clark/Superman by having Lois caught between Richard (James Marsden), her spirited fiancé, and the hero she's still craving. She also has an asthmatic kid who may just be a Supertyke. During Superman's absence, Lois penned a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial (''Why the World Doesn't Need Superman'') that's really a statement of her I-will-survive independence, and Bosworth turns Lois' still-burning attraction to the Man of Steel into a haunted metaphor for the dream of white-knight perfection that every woman, potentially, gives up when she settles down. I wish that Superman Returns  were more original, and (in its first 45 minutes) better paced, but Singer, after two X-Men  films, is now a commanding orchestrator of pop spectacle. The movie gets tighter and fiercer as it goes along. Kevin Spacey, for all the hilarity of his zombie sarcasms, lends a hungry gravitas to Lex's dreams, and as Luthor creates a crystalline fortress of megalomania, which evokes the remains of the World Trade Center, Singer does his grandest work to date. I was happy, in the end, that Superman came back, though I hope next time he does something I can hardly believe.

 Jesus of Nazareth spent 40 days in the desert. By comparison, Superman of Hollywood languished almost 20 years in development hell. Those years apparently raised the bar fearsomely high. Last seen larking about on the big screen in the 1987 dud "Superman IV," the Man of Steel has been resurrected in a leaden new film not only to fight for truth, justice and the American way, but also to  give Mel Gibson's passion a run for his box-office money. Where once  the superhero flew up, up and away, he now flies down, down, down, sent from above to save mankind from its sins and what looked like another bummer summer.  The super-size (more than two and a half hours) "Superman Returns" was written by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, working off a story hatched by them and the director, Bryan Singer, after what appears to have been repeat viewings of Richard Donner's "Superman." Released in 1978, that film ushered Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's original comic creation into the blockbuster age with frothy wit and a cast that included Marlon Brando in a creamy scoop of white hair and Gene Hackman in clover. Christopher Reeve, of course, wore the cape and tights, while Margot Kidder did a fine approximation of the young Katharine Hepburn at her most coltish. Valerie Perrine and Ned Beatty added some laughs, while Glenn Ford supplied a pinch of gravitas.  As nutritious as a box of Cracker Jack and just as yummy, "Superman" was at once a goof and a self-conscious bid at modern mythmaking. Years later, what resonates aren't Mr. Donner's action scenes, which look crude compared with what he would do later in the "Lethal Weapon" series, but how fluidly he changes tones from the iconic (as when the supertoddler lifts a truck off his Earth father) to the playful (as when the souped-up adult realizes that the closetlike phone booth is a thing of the past). Mr. Reeve worked the tonal changes with similar ease, delivering a superhero whose earnestness was strategically offset by his fumbling, bumbling, all-too-human twin, who was just the ticket for the post-Watergate, pre-Indiana Jones moment.  Mr. Singer's Superman, played by Brandon Routh, is a hero of rather different emotional colors, most muted. Like Christopher Nolan's "Batman Begins," Mr. Singer's effort reworks the legend against a vaguely modern, timeless backdrop that blends the thematically old with the technologically new. The story opens with some necrophiliac wizardry and Brando newly arisen as Superman's extraterrestrial father. Well represented even from beyond, the dead actor receives billing for his spectral turn, squeezed between Eva Marie Saint, who plays Superman's earth mother, and Tristan Lake Leabu, who plays Lois Lane's young son. The Daily Planet's star reporter is in turn played by Kate Bosworth, whose glum mien and curtain of brown hair suggests that blondes really do have more fun.  Lois, however, doesn't enter the picture until after the filmmakers have laid the story's Oedipal foundation, which finds two men saying goodbye to the much older women who will, intentionally or not, shape their destinies. In one corner, Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey taking up the role played by Mr. Hackman) bids cold adieu to the crone who will make him fantastically rich; in another, Superman again digs a fiery trough into the Kent family farm upon crash landing. This time, it's the grown man who brings tears to his mother's eyes and who stares at the sinking Kansas (actually Australian) sun,  weighing his responsibility to humankind after a five-year hiatus crossing the galaxies to visit his original home.  It's too bad that Mr. Singer and his colleagues don't really do anything substantial with the good-guy-bad-guy routine. Superman may be a super-creation, but it's his villains rather than his dual identity that have usually given him a kick. Unlike his brooding and angst-ridden rivals in the superhero game, his alter ego is only as interesting as the comic book artist or the actor adding shades of gray to Clark Kent's business suit. Part of the charm of Mr. Reeve's interpretation was that a guy this impossibly handsome, who literally towers over everyone in the office, could hide behind a slouch and oversize eyeglasses. It was absurd, but then so too was the idea that a powerful extraterrestrial would hang around Earth to take the kind of abuse perennially heaped on his human half.  That identity allowed Superman to walk among us, but mostly it allowed him and, by proxy, generations of geeks both creating and consuming the character, to engage ritualistically in a sadomasochistic relationship with Lois Lane. A variation on the high school homecoming queen who sails past the shy guy in glasses on her way to a back-seat tumble with the captain of the football team, this trouble-seeking reporter has always brought out what is most human, vulnerable and identifiable in Superman. He gives her headlines; she gives him a broken, or at least bruised, heart. In "Superman II," which was directed by Richard Lester (and an uncredited Mr. Donner), she gave him a bit more, too, thereby transforming the world's most powerful virgin into a one-night stud.  Near the end of the second film, Superman, realizing that he and Lois have no future, wipes away their boudoir encounter with an amnesia-producing kiss. Mr. Singer expends much more time and many more resources to do pretty much the same, erasing part of the past to create what is essentially a new and considerably more sober sequel to the first two films, one that shakes the earthiness off Superman and returns him to the status of a savior. There's always been a hint of Jesus (and Moses) to the character, from the omnipotence of his father to a costume that, with its swaths of red and blue, evokes the colors worn by the Virgin Mary in numerous Renaissance paintings. It's a hint that proves impossible not to take.  Intentionally or not, the Jesus angle also helps deflect speculation about just how straight this Superman flies. Given how securely Lois remains out of the romantic picture in "Superman Returns," now saddled with both a kid and a fiancé (James Marsden), it's no surprise that some have speculated  that Superman is gay. The speculation speaks more to our social panic than anything in the film, which, much like the overwhelming majority of American action movies produced since the 1980's, mostly involves what academics call homosocial relations. In other words, when it comes to Hollywood, boys will be boys and play with their toys, whether they're sleeping with one another or not, leaving women to weep, worry and wait to be rescued.  Every era gets the superhero it deserves, or at least the one filmmakers think we want. For Mr. Singer  that means a Superman who fights his foes in a scene that visually echoes the garden betrayal in "The Passion of the Christ" and even hangs in the air much as Jesus did on the cross. It's hard to see what the point is beyond the usual grandiosity that comes whenever B-movie material is pumped up with ambition and money. As he proved with his first two installments of "The X-Men" franchise, Mr. Singer likes to make important pop entertainments that trumpet their seriousness as loudly as they deploy their bangs. It's hard not to think that Superman isn't the only one here with a savior complex.  "Superman Returns" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Mild action and no blood.

"Why the World Doesn't Need Superman" reads the title of a piece that wins Lois Lane the Pulitzer Prize in "Superman Returns," the latest bigscreen revival of comicdom's strongest and fastest hero. Not only is she wrong in the context of the story (not to mention real life), but she'll be wrong in the court of public opinion once the world gets a look at this most grandly conceived and sensitively drawn Superman saga. Sure to rate with aficionados alongside "Spider-Man 2" and, for many, "Batman Begins" on the short list of best superhero spectaculars, pic more than justifies director Bryan Singer's decision to jump ship from the "X-Men" franchise, and will pull down stratospheric B.O. around the globe.
What is it about the current climate that has produced three major releases within a month's time that hinge on the hitherto unsuspected offspring of legendarily childless figures -- Jesus in "The Da Vinci Code," Satan in "The Omen" and the title character here? It's an odd development, although it does provide a promising springboard for future series entries, something not enjoyed by the three increasingly dispiriting sequels to Richard Donner's entertaining Christopher Reeve starrer.
New version tips its hat to the 1978 picture in numerous ways; it's dedicated to Reeve and wife Dana; it recycles John Williams' main musical theme; Marlon Brando once again appears, albeit mostly vocally, as Superman's father; and newcomer Brandon Routh bears a conspicuous resemblance to Reeve.
Nonetheless, Singer imprints his handiwork with its own personality. Despite its acute awareness of what's come before, "Superman Returns" is never self-consciously hip, ironic, post-modern or camp. To the contrary, it's quite sincere, with an artistic elegance and a genuine emotional investment in the material that creates renewed engagement in these long-familiar characters and a well-earned payoff after 2� hours spent with them.
After an opening credits sequence devoted to an explosive illustration of the tremendous energy forces in deepest outer space, screenplay by Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris ("X2: X-Men United") returns Superman, briefly, to the farm where he was raised (memory flashbacks neatly recall his learning to fly) after a five-year absence. Soon turning up in Clark Kent guise at the Daily Planet to reclaim his old job, he's nonplussed when he learns his beloved Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth) has a son, Jason (Tristan Lake Leabu) and a good-looking significant other, Richard White (James Marsden), the editor's nephew, and has made her name as banner-carrier for the anti-Superman lobby.
But the Man of Steel nonetheless proves he's worth having around. Old nemesis Lex Luthor (a shaven-headed Kevin Spacey) is up to no good again, harnessing power from a perfect crystal and announcing his return by causing power outages and creating mayhem on an intended airborne space shuttle launch (yes, that's Richard Branson on the shuttle crew) that sends the plane carrying the shuttle and reporters, including Lois, out of control. Arriving a half-hour in, sequence is a doozy, as the burning jet eventually plummets straight for the ground (unavoidable shades of "United 93") until being gently stopped at the last second by the Caped One.
As far as the public is concerned, Superman has made a triumphant return. But Lois remains unimpressed, to the point that a rebuffed Superman takes a lonely flight to Lois' waterfront home (with its gorgeous view of Metropolis) in order to use his X-ray abilities to eavesdrop on her seemingly enviable family life.
Sequence, and all that comes after, renders rubbish all the uninformed pre-release media stories about a gay Superman, as what Singer and his writers are offering here is an elaboration on the theme of Superman (or most any superhero) as an outsider. Brando's Jor-El is heard to tell his son (in dialogue from the Donner version) that he'll always be "different," an "outcast" who can pass as a human being but will never truly be one.
For quite some time, Lois maintains her resistance to Superman, while he can't help but do what he does best -- save the day for those in dire jeopardy (in a truly internationalist, although markedly nonpolitical, spirit, as TV news reports testify). Pushed by editor Perry White (Frank Langella) to get an interview with her old flame, Lois finally meets him on the roof of the Daily Planet's splendidly retro office building, whereupon Superman takes her on a nocturnal flight that beats Howard Hughes' airborne date with Katharine Hepburn in "The Aviator" any day.
By this point, it is clear Singer's take on the impossible love between the two has nothing to do with the old joke that Lois doesn't see the resemblance between Superman and Clark Kent (something picked up on quickly by her son) or the problems of finding a place to change into tights and cape, but perhaps quite a bit to do with themes of loss and the tragedy of fate as classically expressed in opera or ballet. There are dramatic passages where, in another context, one could easily imagine any of the three leading characters breaking out into arias of regret, confession, desire or intent, just as Superman's incredibly graceful and often slow vertical ascents and landings, as well as his moments of reflective isolation, create the frissons of expressive dance movements.
Topping off these aspects is the evocative, darkly lyrical score by John Ottman, continuing in his unique dual role for Singer as composer and editor (with Elliot Graham). The sometimes ethereal qualities of Ottman's work, amplified by significant choral strains, provide an emotional dimension -- and show up Williams' "Star Wars" thematic variation for the bombast it is.
Luthor's dastardly plans involve kidnapping Lois and her son aboard his sleek boat, giving Spacey a big scene in which he can really rock and roll with some very choice line readings. The villain really does seem to have Superman on the ropes at one point, but after a somewhat distended final stretch, the real climax comes in a touching scene between Superman and little Jason, who may or may not be super himself.
Regular Singer cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel has contributed significantly to giving the film a fantastically clear, clean and stable look; "Superman Returns" is an unalloyed pleasure simply to behold. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas and costume designer Louise Mingenbach have anchored their work in the '50s -- an old-fashioned newsroom with modern accoutrements, coats and ties for the men, sharp professional wear for Lois and other women -- but without any cloying self-consciousness. Visual effects are super throughout.
One can praise newcomer Routh very highly indeed simply by saying that he carries this giant film with apparent effortlessness. Thesp possesses a winning, appealing personality that nicely complements his rangy, black-haired, blue-eyed good looks. Parker Posey has a bit of a field day playing Lex Luthor's sassy floozy.
The only semi-disappointment in the cast is Bosworth. First off, she seems too young to have been working for the newspaper for more than five years and to plausibly have had her kid for the same length of time. More significantly, she comes off as flinty and cold for too long, denying Lois a beating heart beneath the brusquely professional m.o. You never get a strong sense of the woman inside the newshound with an unrivaled inside connection to the most famous man in the world.

Clocking in at 157 minutes and shackled to one of the clunkiest mythologies in American pop culture, Superman Returns  is surprisingly buoyant. The movie may not be a single-bound building-leaper but Bryan Singer  reconfigures the daddy of all comic-book sagas into something knowing, witty, and even sensitive.
Not that Superman Returns  lacks a camp appreciation for its material: Singer opens one dark and stormy night with a dying old lady (Noel Neill , the Lois Lane  of the '40s serials) leaving her billions to an attentive young paramour: "I love you, Lex Luthor ," she gasps with her final breath. Triumphant, he tosses off his wig . . . Meanwhile, somewhere in the American heartland, another elderly woman (Eva Marie Saint ) sadly gazes out her window. Then the fire-ship crash-lands and a naked man catapults into the cornfield. "Clark!!??" she quavers hopefully. Her son is back and if you don't know what I'm talking about you can march on over to Homeland Security and surrender your green card right now.
As evil genius Lex Luthor (Kevin Spacey ) and his moll Kitty (Parker Posey  in a Betty Boop  wig) penetrate Superman's abandoned Fortress of Solitude (an ice palace designed by Albert Speer ) to learn the secrets of the universe (it's crystal), Clark "Superman" Kent (newcomer Brandon Routh ) returns from a five-year sabbatical to his job at the Daily Planet . There he discovers that his erstwhile colleague and heartthrob Lois Lane (Kate Bosworth ) is a Pulitzer laureate, for her article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman," and perhaps not coincidentally, the mother of an asthmatic little boy.
Tense and brittle, Lois has moved on. Superman, however, still has a job to do. He'll catch a crashing plane as it hurtles to earth and stop a bullet fired point-blank at his baby-blue eyes. Nonstop urban catastrophes allow Superman to zip hither and thither, dousing geysers of flame with his super breath, but he also makes time to take Lois flying. Square-jawed and clean-cut, Routh has a tender open gaze with occasional intimations of X-ray vision; he admits to being an inadvertent spy ("I hear everything") and is more than a bit vulnerable. Late in the day, Singer contrives to have him plunge from the heavens, accompanied by fake Wagner, his arms outstretched like a dying angel (to land, still splayed, in the ER).
With his two X-Men movies, Singer had multiple misfit personalities to play with. Here, the Michael DoughertyDan Harris  script supplies only one actually two (or maybe three, given Lois's willful inability to recognize Clark Kent  as Superman). But, as Superman does his best to pass for normal, Spacey's Lex Luthor becomes a super-necessity. The pleasure he takes in trilling "kr-r-ryptoni-i-i-ite" is compounded by the cold sexual enjoyment he projects watching the weakened Man of Steel being stomped.
Stressing his protagonist's suffering and resurrection, Singer flirts with the idea of a post-Passion  superhero. Why not? Invented in the 1930s by a pair of Jewish kids from Cleveland, Superman shares a common heritage with Jesus Christ  and is no less universal. "Three things sell papers," Planet  editor Perry White  (Frank Langella ) informs Lois, "tragedy, sex, and Superman." Metonym for the movies, Superman goes everywherethe Planet  newsroom monitors his exploits as simultaneously reported around the worldespecially Germany. Singer's pulp fictions regularly reference the Holocaust, and here Superman's return to Krypton suggests a heritage tour to Poland : "That place was a graveyard," he tells his adoptive mother. "I'm all that's left." Prominently placed in the "Metropolis "-establishing shot, just south of the absent WTC, is that monument to exile, the Museum of Jewish Heritage .
Other religions are acknowledged too (Luthor dares imagine himself the new Prometheus) although there's not much lip service paid to "truth, justice, and the American way." Still, by the time the movie ends with Superman treading air outside Lois's window, the Last Son of Krypton has established himself as a complete Trinity. He's the father and the son and, hovering over Lois and child, something of an eternal spirit. "I'm always around," he assures herjust as long as there's sex, tragedy, and papers to sell.

If the Holy Ghost favors a vulcanized rubber cape this season, the Devil may as well wear Prada . Improving on Lauren Weisberger 's bestselling roman à clefinspired by her stint as assistant to Vogue   editor Anna Wintour The Devil Wears Prada  recounts the adventures of a young Lois Lane in thrall to superwoman Miranda Priestly  (Meryl Streep ), fearsome editrix of Runway magazine.
Andy Sachs  (Anne Hathaway ), a recent J-school grad who, knowing nothing about fashion, gets flukishly hired to be Miranda's flunky, is constantly told that "a million girls would kill for her job." Kill  is the operative word. A onetime journalist from a newspaper family, director David Frankel  establishes Runway's atmosphere of total terrorsecond only to Stalin's court. Andy works for the most demanding, judgmental boss in the history of the 40-hour week. Always on call, she's allowed 15 minutes for lunch and assigned tasks beyond the Twelve Labors of Herculesinstantly obtaining a pre-pub copy of the new Harry Potter  novel or finding her mistress a flight out of Miami mid-hurricane. "It's some absurd weather problem," Miranda imperiously informs her.
