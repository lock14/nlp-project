 Teenage horror-movie spoof, John Waters parody, No Nukes protest movie, twisted sex-education film, quasi-feminist fable, outrageous stunt: Mitchell Lichtenstein’s clever, crude comedy, “Teeth,” is all these and more.  Imagine Candy Christian, the title character of “Candy,” Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg’s satirical novel, as a contemporary mutant teen angel unknowingly afflicted with the mythical condition known as vagina dentata (a toothed vagina). In “Teeth” Dawn (Jess Weixler), that castration myth’s unfortunate embodiment, is a devout Christian who lectures on abstinence and leads the Promise, a group of teenagers who have pledged chastity until marriage. They wear red rings to certify their purity and go on group dates to shield one another from temptation. Dawn’s boyfriend, Tobey (Hale Appleman), has adopted the pledge, but reluctantly.  Ms. Weixler, whose performance earned her a special jury prize at last year’s Sundance Film Festival, suggests a younger, dewy Heather Graham. As Dawn breaks her pledge under fierce duress, her body responds involuntarily, and she wreaks traumatic damage to the unwelcome male intruders. But even after she knows how her body can react, she retains a quality of wide-eyed naïveté, as though that couldn’t really be happening.  The verdant tranquillity of the sleepy suburban town where Dawn and her surly younger stepbrother, Brad, have grown up is marred only by the belching cooling towers of a nearby nuclear power plant. Now and then the camera peers over the brilliant foliage with a smirking sense of mischief to observe these twin towers releasing ominous black plumes into the atmosphere. The movie implies that radiation is responsible for Dawn’s condition, not to mention her stepmother’s declining health and Brad’s satanic inclinations; everyone in the family may have mutated.  Brad is played by the heavy-lidded, ebony-eyebrowed John Hensley of “Nip/Tuck,” whose character on that show, Matt McNamara, attempted to circumcise himself in an early episode. Given the knowing attitude of “Teeth,” Mr. Lichtenstein, an actor turned writer-director, may have intentionally cast him as a sly reference.  The movie is filled with humorous winks. The grotto by a waterfall to which Dawn repairs for steamy love scenes that culminate in bloodcurdling howls of pain recalls a similar location in “Splendor in the Grass,” the 1961 melodrama in which chastity and sexual frustration drive Natalie Wood’s character into a mental hospital.  Dawn’s horrified awakening arrives when she and Tobey visit the waterfall unaccompanied, and one thing leads to another. When he forces himself on her, her body responds savagely, and he flees in agony leaving a part of himself behind. The distraught heroine scours the Internet for information and learns about the myth she incarnates. In the movie’s funniest scene she undergoes a gynecological examination in which the doctor, played by Josh Pais as a bossy, leering know-it-all, receives an excruciating surprise.  As much as you applaud its satiric nerve, once “Teeth” has demonstrated how far it will go, its joke becomes repetitive. Before the movie’s over, the screen is littered with severed pieces of the male anatomy, one of which is snapped up by a dog. Ho-hum. The problem with shockers, comic or otherwise, is that once the coup de grâce is delivered, there are no big surprises left.  “Teeth” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex scenes and prosthetic anatomical parts.

Yanking the ancient myth of vagina dentata up to the present day in a treatment combining outright gore, social satire and freakish comedy, "Teeth" bites off more than it can chew. A game, disarming lead performance from Jess Weixler, who won a jury acting prize at Sundance, goes some way toward making palatable this mish-mash, whose provocative nature could carve out a certain commercial niche. All the same, it will be few guys' notion of an ideal date movie.
Pic's bold high concept, in which a professional teen virgin discovers she has a set of sharp choppers between her legs, demands perfect pitch, as well as stylistic savvy, for the intended dark comedy to come off. It's a tall order, to be sure and, in an ideal world, it might have combined the conceptual outrageousness of '80s Almodovar with the Spanish master's more recent filmmaking smarts.
Alas, first-time writer-director Mitchell Lichtenstein, son of artist Roy and a one-time hunky aspiring thesp when he debuted in "The Lords of Discipline" in 1983, lacks the command to keep the tone consistent when this is what the film needs most. The early going holds promise, as blond, earnest Dawn (Weixler), leads a school chastity movement called the Promise. Dawn has little trouble holding herself to its strict standards until she meets Tobey (Hale Appleman), an upstanding lad who professes similar beliefs.
Nature takes its course, however, and in a moody Garden of Eden-like sequence under a lakeside waterfall, Tobey pushes Dawn too far. As much to her surprise as his, Tobey pays the ultimate price for his transgression, as is made graphically clear in shots of a crucial body part on the ground after it's no longer attached to Tobey.
Dawn sensibly visits a doctor to determine what she's got down there, but he, too, suffers a painful fate for trespassing. And so it goes, with tentative psychological probings of Dawn's dawning awareness crossed with increasing levels of gross-out horror comedy, all to gradually diminishing returns.
One of the script's weirdest formulations involves the heroine's sinister half-brother Brad (John Hensley), a belligerent, tattooed and pierced heavy-metal freak who lives under the same roof with Dawn and their dad and is acting out a lifelong sexual obsession with her. Resolution of this relationship isn't pretty either.
"Teeth" has a generally heavy, vaguely unsavory feel that, fortunately, is lightened by Weixler. Resembling an entirely appealing cross between Heather Graham and Kate Winslet, Weixler is prim and determined at the outset, but injects a gathering intensity of curiosity to her character as the untoward events accumulate. By allowing her to become neither victim nor monstrous avenger, young thesp keeps Dawn engagingly real.
Shot in the Austin area, pic could have used a brighter, sharper visual style to punch up the irreverent elements.

Credit writer-director Mitchell Lichtenstein  with making a first feature that every man in America will watch with his legs crossed: a grisly gyno-horror riff on Carrie  about an abstinent teen (Jess Weixler ) whose chastity belt conceals a dentally augmented vagina. Weixler's sweetly confused Dawn isn't so much saving herself for the right man as saving the right man from her. But once her town's horndog malesan impatient boyfriend (Hale Appleman ), a skeevy doc (Josh Pais ), a creepy half-brother (skin-crawling Nip/Tuck   regular John Hensley )force the issue, the imperiled virgin quickly learns to clamp down and twist, parting franks from beans and leaving plenty of dismembered members and spurting stumps. (In an interesting twist on the usual double standard of male-female nudity, you see several severed dicks but no toothy vertical smiles.) Weixler's appealing, sympathetic presence removes any misogyny from the premise: Indeed, the movie's best joke is its cock-chomping vengeance upon predatory male sexuality, an inversion of the slasher-movie same-old, same-old. (If you bet $20 there's a closing-credits shout-out to Camille Paglia , you'll be rewarded.) But veteran actor Lichtenstein, the son of Pop artist Roy, rarely finds a workable tone, muffling the splattery mayhem with sluggish pacing and a tendency toward camp. Still, even if the movie's little more than a curio, I love the thought of Lichtenstein at the pitch meeting: "It's Jaws  meets The Vagina Monologues !"
