         "The Quiet" is something of a film with a split-personality disorder. It never quite settles on whether it's a "Mean Girls" burlesque of teen life, an "American Beauty"-style bad-things-in-the-suburbs drama, or a wayward horror film. And it certainly never reconciles itself to successfully pulling off a hybrid of the three.
 
 A recently orphaned teenage girl (Camilla Belle) who does not hear or speak is taken in by a couple (Edie Falco and Martin Donovan), much to the consternation of their cheerleader daughter (Elisha Cuthbert). From there secrets are revealed, unsteady alliances are formed and the house undergoing renovations becomes some kind of cornball metaphor.
 


         






   Directed by Jamie Babbit from a script by Abdi Nazemian and Micah Schraft, the film was made as part of a program to give students at the University of Texas at Austin hands-on experience in making a feature film. One can only hope they did not receive passing grades. For reasons perhaps known only to cinematographer M. David Mullen, many interior scenes are shot through a hazy diffusion of smoke, giving the film the unnecessary feel of something sleazy on late-night cable.
 
 Both Cuthbert and Belle are nimble, surprising actresses, and they manage to navigate the film's increasingly ridiculous twists with their dignity intact. They form curious negative reflections of one another, batting dominion of the story back and forth, and their dynamic is the film's only saving grace.
 
 Late in the film, the song "Maybe Not" by indie chanteuse Cat Power comes on as a slow-jam at a school dance. The softly churning, gothic-tinged creepiness of the song shifts what's missing from "The Quiet" into pained relief — what should be a sustained mood piece instead flops around uncertainly, trading in understated strength for noisy diversion.

This dank and rhythmless ''psychological'' potboiler was directed by Jamie Babbit, who made 2000's But I'm a Cheerleader , and though she has shifted tones from shrill camp to moody angst in The Quiet , she still thinks in stereotypes so thin that they put you to sleep the moment they open their mouths. Elisha Cuthbert, who's trying to be the Meryl Streep of Maxim  bimbos, is the bitchy and privately troubled daddy's-girl cheerleader, and Camilla Belle is the shrinking-violet deaf girl who stays with Cuthbert's family and learns its dark (yawn) secret.

 Once upon a time, two beautiful teenagers meet cute and contrived when the good brunette, the newly orphaned Dot (Camilla Belle), moves in with the family of the bad blonde, Nina Deer (Elisha Cuthbert). But while Nina’s space-case mother (Edie Falco) and father (Martin Donovan) warmly welcome the stray, their daughter is soon making like Paris Hilton and mercilessly cutting the interloper down to Nicole Richie size. Deaf and mute and friendless, Dot in turn takes to studying Nina as impassively as an ethnographer in the field. Is she smitten with the other girl or just biding her sweet vengeful time? The answer is less obvious than Ms. Falco and Mr. Donovan’s substandard performances, though rather less compelling than the sight of Nina ironing her cheerleader’s uniform in her underwear.  Neither ambitious enough to take seriously nor sleazy enough to enjoy, “The Quiet” flirts with the trappings of exploitation cinema without going all the way. The director Jamie Babbit, whose films include “But I’m a Cheerleader,” suggestively crowds her two talented leads together, but can’t push them or the film into the fairy-tale surrealism to which she seems to aspire. She dutifully trots out the usual family horrors (a criminally creepy father, a chemically addled mother) so beloved by both exploitation auteurs and the Sundance labs,  where Abdi Nazemian and Micah Schraft developed their screenplay. But what she can’t tap is that go-for-broke lunacy that makes a flick like “Wild Things” a classic of its trashy kind and might have saved this film from that cinematic slag heap known as late August.  “The Quiet” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for dirty words and deeds.

A Lifetime movie on crack, "The Quiet" dredges up every lurid cliche from the well of teen hormonal havoc in a tale of dysfunctional family meltdown that seems unsure whether to push for suburban-Gothic psychosexual excess or tongue-in-cheek malevolence. Following "But I'm a Cheerleader," director Jamie Babbit throws much more than plain old lesbian tendencies at her girls this time around in a movie high on ominous atmosphere that goes so wildly off-base it becomes a borderline guilty pleasure. Commercial chances will depend on teens dumb enough to buy it or adults stoned enough to find it funny. 
Following the death of her widowed father, Dot (Camilla Belle) is taken in by her adoptive godparents, Paul (Martin Donovan) and Olivia (Edie Falco) Deer. Deaf and silent since age 7 when her mother died, Dot is sullen and introspective. She is treated like a freak by the Deers' hostile daughter Nina (Elisha Cuthbert), whose poisonous behavior goes unchecked by mom and dad. 
Dot fits in even less in the "mean girls" world of high school, finding refuge only in banging out a few bars of Beethoven on the music room Steinway.
As Dot quietly observes her new environment, it soon becomes apparent that the Deers are not the Cleavers. Decorator Olivia is a pill-popping zombie, while Paul regularly pops Nina, phoning her at school to ask, "Are you wearing your cheerleader outfit?" 
Pretty soon, everyone is unburdening their secrets to Dot, who has secrets of her own. Nina wants to kill dad (her vengeful love-hate feelings almost find an outlet in a steam-iron incident), Paul acknowledges that he's sick and needs help, while poor Olivia just wants the right wallpaper and tchotchkes.
Into the murky mix, screenwriters Abdi Nazemian and Micah Schraft stir some barely closeted lesbian desire from slutty cheerleader (what is it with Babbit and the pom-pom girls?) Michelle (Katy Mixon, hilarious), whose bedroom is pure contempo-bordello, and who makes best pal Nina look like a rank amateur in the bitchstakes.
Possibly unintended laughs come from the "surprisingly" sensitive and not quite hunky enough hunk Connor (Shawn Ashmore), a sex-addicted jock with a learning disorder who's also a washout on the basketball court. Spurred by the belief that Dot can't hear him, Connor lets rip with some timeless seduction dialogue: "I can smell your hair. It smells like cucumbers. I got really, really hard last night." It's around this point the suspicion takes root that the writers might in fact be joking. However, the push in this direction is far too hesitant.
While it's great fun to see piano wire being employed in carnage again, the film is derailed by its own silliness. This is too bad, since stepsisters Dot and Nina, once they learn to communicate, might have been intriguingly complex characters in a teen thriller with a minimum of logic and subtlety. And Belle and Cuthbert provide more-than-adequate echoes of the Thora Birch-Mena Suvari dynamic.
Babbit does well at teasing out an environment of lurking everyday evil and the movie works best when Dot is locked in silent observational mode, looking poised to unleash some terrible pent-up force on the cracked suburban world. While there's little detail brought to that nondescript world, d.p. M. David Mullen's high-definition, widescreen camerawork supplies a lucid, moody look, matched by Jeff Rona's brooding score.

What if it's not cell phones, iPods , MySpace , and whatever that's keeping the teen demographic out of movie theaters? What if, instead, it's the movies' endless reduction of their complex, muddled, andgaspoccasionally enjoyable lives to a bunch of recycled social-problem clichés? Directed by Jamie Babbit  from a capable but glib screenplay by Abdi Nazemian  and Micah Schraft , this emotionally loaded melodrama turns on the lives of two adolescent girls (sharply played by Elisha Cuthbert  and Camilla Belle ) at once divided and united by dark family secrets in common. Before you can say "Child Welfare Services," sexual abuse, pill popping, cruel peer groups, and (to gild the lily once and for all) physical disability rain down on these two unfortunates, with homicidal tendencies lurking in the wings. The Quiet  has an excellent supporting cast in Edie Falco , Martin Donovan , and Katy Mixon , in a minor but more interesting role as the school vixen, and is competently, even lyrically, directed in high definition by Babbit (with input from students at the University of Texas ). But thematically the movie never reaches beyond the ready-for-prime-time mentality that specializes in psychological shorthand.
