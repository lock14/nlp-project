Count it as one of the great Hollywood mysteries � right up there with the death of Natalie Wood and the career of Vin Diesel � that we�ve had to wait this long for a movie starring a talking milkshake, a floating box of french fries, and a ball of ground beef. Surely Edison didn�t think it would take a hundred years, or he wouldn�t have bothered inventing the Kinetograph. Based on the popular Cartoon Network TV show, Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters
 is every bit as ridiculous as its name. And in all honesty, I have no real idea what it�s about, though I was able to piece together a few things: 1) The movie�s aforementioned heroes Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad are in possession of a piece of exercise equipment, called the Insane-O-Flex, that has the power to destroy Earth; 2) the Insane-O-Flex�s creators (who are either aliens, robots, or lesser-celebrated Matisse paper cutouts) have come to New Jersey to retrieve their invention; and 3) there is a character called MC Pee Pants. That�s it; otherwise the plot is totally incomprehensible. Which doesn�t really matter, because the plot is incidental anyway; it�s just a frame in which to hang a massive collection of absurdist non sequiturs and deadpan pauses, which, depending on your tastes (and possibly your affinity for mind-altering drugs), are either the stuff of comic genius or proof that the world has stopped making sense entirely. Show creators Maiellaro and Willis choose to ignore the siren song of broad commercial appeal and instead run stubbornly � admirably, one could say � in the opposite direction, creating a film that�s even more random and inscrutable than the series, which is saying something. While watching it, I decided that after each page of the script was finished, it was put aside, never to be looked at again, for fear that some logical connection might possibly be found between the action on that page and the next. Which would never do. Because when your film�s villain is a slice of watermelon, the last thing you want is your viewers thinking rationally.


So the city of Boston was caught with its collective pants down by the Cartoon Network 's guerrilla promotion of "Aqua Teen Hunger Force " last January? So we panicked over Lite Brites attached to bridges and behaved like a bunch of old maids who wouldn't know pop culture if it hit them square in the snood?
So maybe we had a point. "Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters ," the big-screen version of the popular "Adult Swim " cartoon, is, essentially, an act of terrorism against entertainment. It's inconsequential, potty - mouthed, extremely silly, and -- the worst sin of all -- dead boring.
If you're already a fan of the crudely animated TV adventures of a meatball, a milkshake, and a bag of french fries, you'll want to reverse the above judgment. Of course, if you're already a fan, you're probably really, really stoned, and you'll find meaning in the dimples on a golf ball. Making sense isn't the point of "Aqua Teen," or, rather, making not-sense is
 the point. I get it. I just don't have much use for it, not when it's this pleased with itself.
When the show started in December 2000 , the goateed, reasonable Frylock (the voice of Carey Means ), vain jerk Master Shake (Dana Snyder ), and dimly sweet-natured Meatwad (show co-creator Dave Willis ) were briefly superheroes. That charade was dropped in favor of random slacker vaudeville: The three heroes argue a lot, lock horns with the sleazy guy next door, and are visited by, among many others, pixellated aliens who look like refugees from "Space Invaders."
"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters" -- like everything else here, the title doesn't quite scan and that's what's funny, dude
 -- briefly touches on the characters' origins before bringing on Abraham Lincoln as a testy inventor, gay extraterrestrials from Pluto, and a diabolic exercise machine from the future.
Sounds pretty bent, maybe even funny? It is, in fits and starts. It's also padded beyond all reason, even at 86 minutes. "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" changes gears so often, and with such little effect, that you just drift off and start thinking about your laundry.
Fans will be happy to see recurring characters like Dr. Weird and MC Pee Pants , a giant rapping spider in a diaper. Non-fans will consider that a warning. It's a binary experience: You're either in on this thing or you're not. If not, with the proper chemical enhancement you too may find daring post-modern comedy in "Aqua Teen Hunger Force." Or in a cat toy.

         Normally doled out in 15-minute helpings during Cartoon Network's "Adult Swim" block, "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" is the sort of thing a bright, underachieving college student might come up with while sitting in a fast-food joint at 4 a.m., after doing the kinds of things that cause college students to crave salty snacks in the middle of the night. Aggressively plotless and animated with deliberate crudity, the series — yes, the one whose publicity stunt backfired in Boston, which was not amused — chronicles the adventures, or more often non-adventures, of a talking milkshake, meatball and order of fries.
 
 "Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters" does much the same, only with a sixfold  running time. Creators Matt Maiellaro and Dave Willis, who wrote and directed the film, don't seem to have lost much sleep worrying about whether the series' free-associative looseness might wear thin at feature length.  Just when you've gotten used to the idea of ambulatory fast food, up pops an alien shaped like a slice of watermelon. Should that not sufficiently blow your mind, said slice is accompanied by Neal Peart, the drummer from the progressive rock band Rush (doing his own voice, and presumably his own solos).
 


         






   Self-aware to a fault, the movie is post-explanation, post-narrative and, most important, post-effort, which makes plot summary not only undesirable but unwise. Master Shake (voiced by Dana Snyder), Meatwad (Willis) and Frylock (Carey Means) are minding their own business when they come into possession of the Insan-o-flex, an exercise machine that, when assembled, turns into a giant robot whose rampaging tendencies threaten all of New Jersey and points beyond. As a mohawked droid apparently known as the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past warns, "The world as you know it will become a world as you have never known it, starring Chow Yun-Fat."
 
 There's also an evil scientist whose lair is rapidly going condo, a pair of angular blobs from somewhere beyond Pluto, a diaper-wearing arachnid DJ and two square-edged space creatures straight out of a primitive video game. Did I mention Time Lincoln?
 
 How this all fits together isn't the point, or rather the point is that it doesn't. The last thing Maiellaro and Willis would want is to get caught trying too hard.
 
 When it works, there's an appealing absurdity to the left-field gags. It's doubtful a more structured approach could have accommodated the movie's dizzying flurry of half-submerged references (a stray line from "War Games") and outright lifts (a plot turn nicked from "Attack of the Killer Tomatoes").
 
 Still, a little of this junk-drawer fusillade goes a long way. It would have been interesting to see Maiellaro and Willis up the ante for their big-screen outing, rather than simply riffing at greater length.
 
  The movie never becomes tiresome, but only because it demands so little effort.
 
 "Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters." MPAA rating: R for crude and sexual humor, violent images and language. Running time: 1 hour, 29 minutes. In general release.   

The first, best season of Aqua Teen Hunger Force   Cartoon Network's late-night slacker burlesque about three Jersey roommates who happen to be sentient food products  was mind-spanking randomness, rooted in faultless character reality. The subsequent seasons have been a descent into synapse-snapping madness. Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters  turns that madness to full-on seizure. The plot can't be summarized: Let's just say that crazy s--- happens, and occasionally, you laugh.


In one of the sillier recent instances of terrorist paranoia, Boston filed criminal charges against hirelings who installed cryptic electronic street signage promoting this Cartoon Network spinoff. Resulting controversy didn't spike ratings for the latenight cable series, and probably won't significantly impact a movie that will draw members of the show's ardent fan base but few others before ancillary release. Still, this feature-length expansion offers a diverting package of surreal, rude stoner- and pop culture-based humor that will delight youthful viewers while bewildering stray elders.
"Aqua Teen Hunger Force" is a cartoon "Hellzapoppin'�" for those weaned on videogames, hip-hop and overblown mall flicks. Its protagonists are talking, animate fast-food items. Dairy product Master Shake (voiced by Dana Snyder) is a vain, bossy type whose bright ideas are invariably dim ones.
His bullying works well enough on gullible Meatwad (Dave Willis, who, like series co-creator Matt Maiellaro, voices numerous characters). Meatwad is a blob of expired ground-beef-like matter capable of surprise morphing and other talents. The operation's brains belong to Frylock (Carey Means), a goateed pocket of salty fries that can be fired at will like rockets, yet his voice of intelligent skepticism is rarely heeded.
The Aqua Teens (a moniker that, like much else here, has no practical explanation) live in a dumpy New Jersey house next to slobby human Carl (Willis), who's forever irked by their intrusions into his lowbrow lifestyle.
A big leap beyond the 15-minute Cartoon Net segments, "Colon Movie Film" is more elaborate in technical terms, drawing on a wider array of deliberately clashing animation styles. Still, it hews faithfully to the series' anarchic, scatological tenor.
Characters are intro'd in a parodic 1960s-style "Intermission Time," with singing concession items rudely interrupted by aggressive, heavy-metal snacks shouting aggressive audience exhortations ("If I see you videotaping this movie/Satan will rain hot acid down your throat"). Then titles identify the setting as "Egypt, Millions of Years Ago, 3 p.m., 1492, New York." The Aqua Teens are seen breaking out of a pyramid crypt, only to be attacked by a giant poodle.
All this turns out to be another fabrication of the trio's collective backstory by the braggarty Master Shake. But don't expect plot logic to kick in once this prelude is exposed as a sham.
There is
 a semblance of a narrative thread to the feature's remainder: The Insane-O-Flex, a home exercise machine Shake has stolen from Carl, turns out to be an unstoppable killing thingy that wreaks havoc on the general populace.
Force trio attempts to stop the Insane-O-Flex in its usual disorganized fashion, fending off numerous others who want to control the machine for their own obscurely nefarious purposes. Among them are megalomaniac mad scientist Dr. Weird and hapless assistant Steve (both voiced by C. Martin Croker); Err and Ignignokt, 2-D tributes to old Atari game figures; Oglethorpe and Emory, would-be conquerors from the "Plutonian League"; their often inappropriately horny ally, Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past; and drummer Neal Peart, from veteran progressive-metal trio Rush.
If this all sounds like a bunch of nonsense, rest assured, it is -- gleefully so. Perhaps the best description of what both the feature and its long-running TV-show source aim for was supplied by Maiellaro in an interview: "If it's not funny, at least it's weird and unexpected."
"Colon Movie Film" is not laugh-out-loud stuff most of the time. But its sheer imaginative arbitrariness can be delightful, provided viewers can connect to its admittedly limited-access wavelength.
R rating is fully merited by frequently tasteless content, though the absurdism at work feels less offensive than loutish tube toons like "Family Guy." Soundtrack choices are another platform for in-joke satire, with Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" particularly flogged.


Where most other Adult Swim  shows are nothing but snarked-up jalopies salvaged from the Hanna-Barbera  junkyard, ATHF exists in its own little world populated by Frylock (voiced by Carey Means ), a blaxploitation box of fries; Master Shake (Dana Snyder ), who is indeed no smarter than your average dairy product; and Meatwad (Willis), who, with his ability to take the shape of myriad meat products, might reasonably be described as "cute" were he not also covered in hair. The trio's big-screen debut features an exercise machine sent from the future to destroy the planet, and an origin story involving the Sphinx, Abraham Lincoln , and the FBI . But narrative's beside the point in a movie created by two guys who gorge on pop culture's high-fat diet and regurgitate it into something approaching . . . art? Close enough.
