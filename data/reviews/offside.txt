         In the language of soccer, to be offside is to have gone too far, to have crossed an invisible line past which it is forbidden to go. As the exceptional Iranian film "Offside" demonstrates, if you are a woman in Iran, just attempting to go to a men's soccer game puts you over that line and into territory that is completely out of bounds.
 
  A cross between socially conscious cinema and the irrepressible "Bend It Like Beckham," "Offside" is a charming, character-driven film that conveys enormous feeling for its people. These include both the determined young women for whom soccer is "more important than food" and the over-matched soldiers whose heart really isn't in keeping them away from the World Cup qualifying match they are determined to see.
 


         






   Winner of the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival, "Offside" is the latest film by director Jafar Panahi, whose previous works (including "The White Balloon," "Crimson Gold" and "The Circle") have won major awards and stood unmistakably apart from the work of his countrymen. For though Iranian cinema (and its billboard directors such as Abbas Kiarostami and Mohsen Makhmalbaf) has mesmerized critics, the films are by and large too rarefied to have even a hope of getting traction in this country.
 
 Panahi, however, is a different story. Almost alone among his countrymen, Pahani believes in strongly dramatic scenarios, situations in which things happen and conflicts arise. He is a social filmmaker in the classic neorealist mode, a director who sees the drama in everyday situations and believes in cinema's power to point out problems and eliminate injustice. To be that kind of filmmaker in a theocracy like Iran takes some doing, and though Panahi's films gain strength from having substantial issues such as the plight of women to deal with, he also has to be careful, as Soviet bloc directors had to be in years past, to say things without seeming to say them. As it stands, except for bootleg DVDs, his films are almost impossible to see in his homeland.
 
 All Panahi's films have a realistic quality, but "Offside" is a triumph of documentary-style cinma vrit. Much of it was actually shot, using small cameras and nonprofessional actors, inside Tehran's packed Azadi Stadium on the day of the 2006 match between Iran and Bahrain to determine which country would qualify for the World Cup. This was a tremendous risk for Panahi (who produced, directed, edited and co-wrote with Shadmehr Rastin) not only for logistical reasons but also because the film would have been impossible if the game didn't turn out the way the script intended.
 
 "Offside" opens not at the game but with a distraught father searching minibuses full of raucous stadium-bound fans chanting "Iran winner! Bahrain loser!" He has just found out his daughter will be trying to make her way into the game,  and he fears dire consequences for her if she is busted. Looking almost as worried is a young person on the bus whose careful attempts at disguise — hair under a large cap, flag draped over shoulders, Iran's red, white and green colors painted on the face — do not really hide the fact that this is a woman trying to get over the wall and into the game.
 
 With uniformed soldiers and zealous officials in plainclothes everywhere, this proves a difficult maneuver to pull off for the entire game, and much of "Offside" takes place in a makeshift holding area on an outer rim of the stadium. There six girls are brought together, exiled to a kind of Pisgah view of the proceedings — they can hear the shouting of the fans but can't see what is going on. In some ways these young women, who range in temperament from demure to devious to confrontational, couldn't be more different. But they share a passion for the sport and are a match for the soldiers guarding them in both personal soccer experience ("I'm a dribble queen," one announces defiantly) and knowledge of Iran's team and its strategies.
 
  Much of "Offside's" drama comes from the often-humorous confrontations between the girls and the not-much-older soldiers, many of whom come from rural areas and are at a loss as to how to defend a system that keeps women from stadiums but allows them into movie theaters.
 
  The great virtue of "Offside," however, is that it never degenerates into an us-versus-them situation. Panahi is as sympathetic to the overmatched soldiers, especially in a wryly farcical going-to-the-bathroom subplot, as he is to the women. He understands that a repressive system victimizes the oppressors as much as the oppressed.
 
 Besides providing a sense of what day-to-day life is like in Iran,  "Offside" captures the mass hysteria of fandom, of an addiction so intense that even a blind man feels compelled to attend the game in person rather than listen on the radio.
 
 Finally, and not surprisingly, "Offside" is not about sports at all. It is, in its own quiet and entertaining way, about the value of freedom, dignity and individual choice. By its close we care as much as the captive six do about both soccer in general and the all-important fate of Iran's national team in particular, and that is no small thing.

Girls just want to have fun  and cheer their team at a World Cup soccer event. But that's not easy in Iran, where women are banned from public sporting events. Those caught sneaking in are detained by bewildered boy soldiers in Offside , Jafar Panahi's wonderfully funny, outspoken shaggy-dog story, a light counterweight to his sadder 2000 feminist drama The Circle . Absurdity reaches a peak in a hilarious set piece involving a guard, a ''prisoner,'' and an escorted trip to the men's stalls when a girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.

 “Offside,” the new film from the Iranian director Jafar Panahi, is a sports movie in which the game takes place entirely out of sight. The setting, most of the time, is a stadium in Tehran, where the Iranian national soccer team is facing Bahrain in a qualifying match for the World Cup. We hear the cheers and groans of the crowd and some improvised play-by-play from a few spectators, but like the film’s main characters — die-hard supporters of the team, some of them adorned with face paint in the red, white and green of the Iranian flag — we never see what is happening on the field.  Those unlucky fans are young women, whose attempts to see the match live are stymied by the police and by strict rules forbidding the mixing of the sexes. Trying to pass for boys, a half-dozen of them have been rounded up and confined to a makeshift holding pen on a ramp outside the stadium walls. The young soldiers who are their captors seem to be just as confused and demoralized as the women themselves, and the film’s rich, pointed comedy arises from the sense that all of them, men and women alike, are trapped in an absurd, insoluble predicament.  Which is not to say that they suffer equally. In a previous film, “The Circle” — one of the best works of cinema to come out of Iran in the past decade — Mr. Panahi followed a collection  of women through the streets of Tehran as they tried to evade arrest, family violence and other forms of injustice. That film painted an unsparing, unsentimental picture of the way laws and social customs are often arbitrarily and harshly enforced in Iran.  While the gist of “Offside” is the same, its tone is more insouciant, as it celebrates the guile and toughness of its heroines while casting a sympathetic glance at the ethical quandaries facing their jailers. The men want to do their jobs, to follow the rules, and in a few cases to protect the virtue of their captives from what they perceive as a risk of dishonor, but mostly they want peace and quiet and a chance to sneak a glance at the soccer field to see how their team is doing.  Instead they find themselves mired in an endless series of quarrels and negotiations. Perhaps because of censorship that limits what can be shown, Iranian movies are often propelled by argument, which Mr. Panahi’s restless camera turns into its own kind of action. An inspired piece of farce unfolds when one of the girls announces that she has to use the bathroom in a stadium that only has facilities for men. But the lightheartedness is often shadowed by the threat of real trouble, since even the lighthearted breaking of a silly rule can have serious consequences. (It also turns out that one of the women has gone to the game for reasons far more grave than fandom.)  Part of the film’s risky, transgressive energy arises from the circumstances of its making. Denied official permission to shoot “Offside,” Mr. Panahi went ahead under the pretext of making another, less provocative film. And he concludes with a remarkably exuberant sequence that doubles as a celebration of his own sneaky success. It’s not giving anything away to divulge that at the end Iran wins the game, since “Offside” has already made clear that such a victory, like the outcome of any other sporting event, is unlikely to really change anything.  “Offside” is rated PG. It has some strong language.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

Teenage girls, all ardent soccer fans, masquerade as boys to crash the Iran-Bahrain game at Tehran stadium in the hilariously offbeat "Offside." In his most accessible and spontaneous picture, ranking Iranian helmer Jafar Panahi reveals unsuspected comic gifts barely visible in his dramatic festival winners "The White Balloon," "The Circle" and "Crimson Gold." Providing continuity is the strong underlying social theme of mistreated femmes deprived of basic rights --- here, the right to root for their team. After bowing in Berlin competition, this tightly paced pic should prove a highly sellable item for Celluloid Dreams and widen Panahi's audience base considerably.
Even as it cleverly spotlights the absurdity of Iran's strict segregation policies toward the female sex, "Offside" also describes a surprisingly rebellious world of young people who are not ready to buy into their country's imposed social values. Apart from its filmic merits, pic should have a role to play abroad in shining a light on some little-known facets of Iranian society. It has not yet been cleared for release in Iran.   
Camera follows a girl riding to the stadium with a rowdy busload of flag-waving roughnecks. Though wearing boy's clothing, a military cap and warpaint on her face in the national team colors, she is easily spotted. Yet the excited fans barely notice her. Nor is she the only femme trying to get into the game, as one boy casually points out two more girls on another bus to his companion.
It is immediately clear that women are not allowed into soccer matches, which are all-male events, and that those who ignore the edict are breaking the law and will be punished. But with each new challenge the girl faces, the pic veers away from drama through the sheer absurdity of the situation and churns up a laugh. Her main hurdle is getting past a police checkpoint, where each fan is patted down. She watches the techniques used by more experienced gate-crashers, like pretending to be blind, but at the last moment her courage fails and she's caught.
Taken to a holding pen on the upper deck of the stadium just out of sight of the big game, she joins other girls who have been arrested. Yet, as the young soldiers assigned to guard them know, many others have slipped inside. The uptight young officer in charge (Safar Samandar) is a farm boy roundly mocked by the city girls; another provincial soldier (Mohamad Kheirabadi), though, is willing to watch the game through an opening and recount the plays to the impatient girls. The droll tale hits a high point when one girl (Aida Sadeghi) insists on going to the bathroom, and the dismayed soldier forced to accompany her to the men's room makes her wear a poster on her face to keep from being recognized.
In a more relaxed final act, the captured girls are joined by a boy arrested for sneaking in firecrackers and put on a bus bound for jail. This quieter moment gives Panahi a chance to reveal hidden aspects of his characters.
Ensemble acting by the non-pro cast relies on each girl embodying a different type, from the gentle schoolgirl doing something naughty to the masculine toughie who looks and talks like a boy. Each is so comically down-to-earth she effortlessly grabs audience sympathy. The two main soldiers work as sympathetically-viewed counterpoints who, try as they might, are unable to logically defend the male supremacist laws of their country.
Film's great virtue is its spontaneity, very different from the careful control of the director's earlier work, but very much in synch with the hypercharged stadium atmosphere. Though it doesn't hurt the picture, soccer buffs may be disappointed that none of the game is shown. Mahmoud Kalari's loose, handheld camerawork with its constantly roving lens captures the chaos amusingly. Panahi's own editing is fast and tense.

Jafar Panahi  is a paradoxical populist. He makes crowd-pleasing art movies, often set in the midst of lifethe urban crowd is one of his subjectsand is a virtuoso director of (non) actors. On the other hand, this most widely seen of Iranian filmmakers is also the most frequently banned.
Like his previous hits The White Balloon  and The Circle , Panahi's soccer movie Offside  is blatantly metaphoric and powerfully concrete, deceptively simple and highly sophisticated in its formal intelligence. Panahi may be a disciple of Iranian modernist Abbas Kiarostami  but he's closer in some ways to Chinese filmmaker Jia Zhangke , another maker of fictionalized social documentariesthough Panahi works on a less epic scale and is more attached to close-ups than long shots.
Panahi specializes in tumultuous activity in tight spaces: Offside  opens on one packed minibus and ends on another. The first hurtles toward Tehran 's Azadi Stadium  where Iran  is to play a World Cup match against Bahrain ; the second, a police van, swerves through streets clogged with chanting hordes in the game's aftermath. Offside  is the funniest of Panahi's features, with a carnival atmosphere accentuated from the get-go by the realization that some of the fans en route to Azadi are women in drag.
Among other proscriptions, Iranian women are not permitted to attend sports events and, before the soccer match begins, another game is afoot. "They're pros, they know how to get inthey know all the tricks," one boy tells his buddy, appraising the disguised females on a passing bus. The lone girl on their bus is, however, an obvious novice. She's unconvincingly dressed (her idea of a boy is too stylish) and fatally uncertain. After paying an inflated price for a scalped ticket, she's approached by a guard, instinctively flinches ("Please don't search me"), and winds up in an improvised holding pen on the stadium's upper level, along with a half-dozen other girls.
In a formal as well as political sense, Offside  is about what can't be seen. The roar of the crowd is a constant but the game itself is only intermittently glimpsed. Occasionally one of the soldiers will report on the progress of the matchor act it out, much to the captives' disgust. These girls are not only more street-smart than the country boys who guard them but more soccer-smart. The soldiers are ashamed and unhappy; their commander is an excitable Azeri who, contemplating his corral, cannot help reminiscing about his farm back home. (He's dumbstruck, though, when one girl shows up in a purloined military uniformarrested because she was ballsy enough to seat herself in an official box.)
Given its mouthy protagonists, Offside  is a voluble moviethe real match here is between soldiers and prisoners. The two groups have ample time to discuss the nature of the situation. Women are banned from soccer, it's explained, so that male fans can be their profane selves. Asked why Japanese women were admitted to the previous matcha disaster after which seven spectators were trampled to deatha soldier points out that they don't understand Farsi. "Let us in," one girl assures a soldier. "We promise not to listen."
Largely one-sided banter, the contest turns wilder when a soldier is assigned to escort one of the women to the toilet. As the stadium facilities are male-only, she's given a poster to wear as a mask; for his part, the soldier is compelled to secure the graffiti-inscribed washroom in advance of her entry and then, beleaguered as any goalie, hold off six guys trying to break through his outstretched arms. He's saved by an Iranian goalbladders undrained, the fans rush back to their seatsbut he loses his charge, who rushes in as well. Score one for the ladies!
Part sports-inspirational, part women's prison film, Offside  confounds expectations regarding genre as well as gender. Panahi has things both wayshis movie is critical and utopian, cinema verité and political allegory. The battle of the sexes is ultimately subsumed in nationalism but the penitentiary walls cannot hold. The lengthy crowd scenes that end this dodgy, dexterous performance intimate a universal liberation.
