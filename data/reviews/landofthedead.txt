The first thing you see after the opening credits is a dingy, rusted restaurant sign advertising � what else? � "Eats." The shot, artfully accomplished via a slowly swooping crane, is a note-perfect moment: part wry graveyard chuckle to be sure, but with more than a touch of grim melancholy to it. The iconography of Romero�s worldview-cum-horror show has come a long way in the 37 years since he first shattered just about every cinematic taboo with the original Night of the Living Dead
, and then topped himself twice again with 1978�s Dawn of the Dead
, a sly, humorous ode to the birth of American mall culture and the death of individuality, and 1985�s Day of the Dead
, a bleak, surreal portrait of desperate civilians versus unhinged soldiers, all but imprisoned in a dank, subterranean army depot that might as well have been yet another circle of Dante�s Inferno. And throughout it all those creepy dead folk, up and at �em with no explanation (thankfully) and just dying for some good eats. So now Romero�s hapless, sometimes hopeless characters are well and truly in the Land of the Dead
. Worse than that, Dennis Hopper�s running the show. As the affluent, ruthless Kaufman, Hopper carries the well-pressed stink of Enron-ian faux-entitlement about him, controlling a massive, shining skyscraper nicknamed Fiddler�s Green for the benefit of the upper classes. Rising from the center of an otherwise dead city like some obscenely festive memory of the corrupt society that birthed it, the Green is heavily fortified and guarded by Kaufman�s private shocktroops. Inside, those with the financial means and the right, white skin tones wine and dine as though the world hadn�t ended after all. Elsewhere, on the streets, in the ghetto areas that surround the Green, however, revolution of a sort is brewing, galvanized by the archetypal antihero Riley (Baker) and his new pal Slack (Argento, daughter of Italian horror maestro Dario), a former hooker with a yen for revenge. Add John Leguizamo�s opportunistic but naive Cholo, a runner for Kaufman who hasn�t yet figured out this whole class thing, and Romero has again crafted a character-driven horror film that doubles as a metaphor for both the current economic disparity in America and, to a lesser degree, the war on terror. Speaking of terror, the local flesh-eaters, led by a hulking former gas-station attendant who�s by far the smartest zombie on the block, have begun to relearn how to use basic tools skills, augmenting their already formidable dentistry. Romero�s populist horror story is, of course, slathered to the jugular with some seriously MPAA-challenging gore effects, courtesy of KNB EFX Group (late of Sin City
). It wouldn�t be a Romero film without at least a few dozen exploding heads, piles of steaming viscera, and botched rescue attempts that end with the lurching corpses gnawing on fresh-killed human take-away. Gore fans can rest easy: The film�s contractually obligated R-rating is borderline NC-17, and the red stuff spurts in abundance. Even Romero�s best films have previously suffered from budgetary constraints and sporadic bouts of semiwooden acting that left nonfans wondering what all the fuss was about. Land of the Dead
 suffers much less in that department thanks its substantial budget, Leguizamo�s edgy theatrics, and a gently touching turn by Robert Joy as Riley�s scarred shadow, Charlie. Hopper, unsurprisingly, devours scenery like he�s already dead and loving it, but for once his penchant for overacting is overshadowed by the real stars of Romero�s world: They�re dead, they�re all messed up, but it�s great to finally have them back in town.


The most touching thing about "George A. Romero's Land of the Dead" is how much the post-apocalyptic sets look like the urban ruins from one of John Carpenter's "Escape from . . ." pictures.
This is also what's most disappointing about the film. Romero is the pioneer responsible for directing "Night of the Living Dead," "Dawn of the Dead," and "Day of the Dead" -- seminal movies that put an original, largely intelligent face on schlock horror. This new movie looks and feels like someone else's better-made schlock.
Sure, the sensibility is all Romero (he has real affection for his zombies). But the filmmaker can't quite bring himself to take his material as seriously as he did, especially in the first two installments. He appears to be laughing and winking throughout this new movie, which brings it much too close to Carpenter's action pictures. The result is a shambles of shootouts and gore.
Through three "Dead" films, Romero had realized a trenchant vision in which civilization was backsliding into savagery. This fourth film lazily extends that notion, while embracing the videogaming culture his movies have helped foster: zombies with keypads exterminating zombies.
The future in "Land of the Dead" is one in which America has pretty much eaten itself. Zombies have become a fact of life. They live on the margins of an unnamed city, which is surrounded by an electric fence designed to keep them out. (A bite from them turns human into the undead.) The zombies' part of town is a blah-suburban ghetto, which mercenaries frequently invade to retrieve food and other necessities for the impoverished humans living in their own slum.
The remaining outpost of bourgeois humanity is located in a Trump-like tower called Fiddler's Green. Part mall, part studio soundstage, it's a luxury enclave where the rich can ignore that the world has come to a pretty grim slowdown. (The wait list is 3,000 people long.) The Green is run by a greedy overseer named Kaufman (Dennis Hopper), and he's been using the mercenaries to return with goodies that the rich will buy at a considerable markup.
The central action gets underway when a head mercenary, Cholo (John Leguizamo), learns that Kaufman won't let him into 
the luxury co-op and steals the big train-like tank they use to plow into the zombie zones (the vehicle's name is Dead Reckoning). Cholo holds it hostage in a bid to extort millions from Kaufman. He, in turn, hires Cholo's good-hearted co-worker, Riley (Simon Baker), to retrieve the tank.
Riley is looking for a world where there are no fences. When this is all over, he's moving to Canada.
In the meantime, the dead have discovered (very slowly) how to arm themselves and strike back at Kaufman's empire. The film's setup has a promising ring, but Romero's smart bombs never detonate. The zombie underclass metaphor is obvious, yet as the movie wears on Romero seems to want to evoke the current presidential administration ("We don't negotiate with terrorists!" Kaufman barks at one point), turning the mobilized zombies into crypto-insurgents.
But Romero's allegorical skills aren't as sharp as they used to be. The 1968 "Night of the Living Dead" was bold and provocative about interracial cooperation during the civil rights era. "Dawn of the Dead" held up a mirror to our rampant consumerism. "Land of the Dead" flirts with the idea of standing for pointed rebellion but opts instead to have a good time playing with the zombies.
Those zombies are terribly made up and can barely hold the screen. But they do demonstrate how human flesh, when gnawed into, can pull like taffy.
Thankfully, the casting is not so bad that the creatures steal the show. Asia Argento does. She plays a prostitute who winds up helping Riley get back Dead Reckoning and defend the city. A movie this gory would seem right up the alley of an actress whose father is the Italian horror visionary Dario Argento. She could have played the part in a coma, but she brings pleasing zip, danger, and more than one facial expression to the proceedings.

         Back in 1968, fledgling Pittsburgh filmmaker George A. Romero unleashed upon an unsuspecting public a low-budget zombie horror picture called "Night of the Living Dead," which remains one of the scariest movies ever made — in 1999 it was even listed in the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress. Successful sequels followed over the years, and now "George A. Romero's Land of the Dead" reveals that Romero remains the master of a genre he reinvented.
 
  Probably nobody understands better than Romero that he was unlikely ever to equal the fright he stirred up in his first film in depicting a relentless zombie assault on a family holed up in its isolated farmhouse. But Romero is luckily a true visionary, and he has always been able to match bigger budgets with ideas, ingenious plotting and mordant wit. For the energetic "Land of the Dead," he and his crew have created a darkly textured world in which zombies have been roaming the country for years.
 


         






    In an unnamed city that resembles Pittsburgh, Kaufman (Dennis Hopper), an archetypal ruthless tycoon, has holed up along with minions and other wealthy types in a brightly lighted tower that dominates the city's skyline. In this condominium/office building with a luxury mall, the privileged few continue life as they did before the outbreak of the zombies.
 
  Sustaining a quality life in the tower requires Kaufman to employ the services of mercenaries headed by stalwart, level-headed Riley (Simon Baker), who wants only to accumulate enough money to head for Canadian wilderness, and his hot-headed second in command Cholo (John Leguizamo). Riley has a loyal sidekick in Robert Joy's Charlie, a sharpshooter badly scarred on one side of his face from a fire from which Riley rescued him. Also a good shot is Asia Argento's hooker, whom Riley has also rescued — from a nightclub gladiator cage in which she is pitted against zombies.
 
  In their latest raid, however, Riley rightly senses that the zombies, who can be killed only by being shot in the head, are beginning to think and communicate with each other. Big Daddy (Eugene Clark), in fact, a massive zombie — in the film they're called walkers — is deeply angered by Riley and Cholo's latest bloody raid. With the volatile Cholo ready to explode if he doesn't get what he wants and with Big Daddy increasingly capable of leading a walker march on the city, nonstop action kicks in.
 
  Romero easily commands an enormous cast, a plethora of action sequences and a cornucopia of special effects — some of them very gory — and creates one darkly dazzling image after another that allows "Land of the Dead" to emerge without any nudging whatsoever as a bleakly humorous, hard-charging allegory about society devouring itself as the chasm between the rich few and the countless poor could scarcely open wider. "Land of the Dead" isn't that scary, in the sense of evoking spine-tingling terror, but it offers a compelling, striking vision of the near-future that suggests there is in the world today much that's scarier than zombies.
 
 'Land of the Dead'

 
 MPAA rating:
 R for pervasive strong violence and gore, language, brief sexuality and some drug use
 
 Times guidelines:
 Although there are a couple of eye-poppers, the violence and gore quotient is standard for the horror genre and is not a lingering, morbid nature. But way too intense for children.

 In "George A. Romero's Land of the Dead," an excellent freakout of a movie, the living no longer have the advantage or our full sympathies. The fourth installment in Mr. Romero's vaunted zombie cycle (which began with his 1968 masterpiece, "Night of the Living Dead"), the new film is also the latest chapter in what increasingly seems like an extended riff on Dante's "Inferno."  In the earlier "Dead" films, Mr. Romero guided us through circles of hell that, despite the flesh-eating ghouls, looked a lot like the exurban world outside our windows. With this new movie, we jump straight to the ninth circle, where Satan is a guy in a suit and tie who feasts on the misery of others, much as the dead feast on the living.  It's a sign of both Mr. Romero's waggish humor and control as a director that the guy in the suit and tie is played by the cult-movie icon Dennis Hopper, an often unrestrained performer who here is right on the money. Mr. Hopper plays Mr. Kaufman, the absolute ruler of a haven called Fiddler's Green, a tower of steel and glass at the center of a city with more than a passing resemblance to Manhattan. The tower, which appears to have been modeled on a Vegas hotel, complete with the usual feedlots, luxury stores and glassy-eyed shoppers, rises above the devastated metropolis like a threat and a promise. Outside its locked doors,  amid atmospheric squalor, the huddling masses distract themselves with bread and circuses, while one man agitates for revolution.  Beyond: zombieland.  Although they've always had a strong political subtext, Mr. Romero's zombie movies, which also include "Dawn of the Dead" (1978) and "Day of the Dead" (1985), have  emphasized praxis over philosophy. To that end, the living hero of this film isn't the agitator, but a no-nonsense tough, Riley, played by the fine young Australian actor Simon Baker. Best known for the television show "The Guardian," he has done exceptional work in both "L.A. Confidential" and "Ride With the Devil," and in this film he holds the center with an attractive lack of fuss. His character is one of those burned-out warriors who says he wants to pack it in, only to be coerced back into action.  This may partly explain why Mr. Romero, who hasn't made a zombie movie in two decades, shines such a sympathetic light on him.  There aren't a lot of people in "Land of the Dead" whom the director likes as much as he does Riley, or for that matter, his zombie alter ego, Big Daddy (Eugene Clark). We meet Riley and Big Daddy after an attention-seeking credit sequence that recaps the zombie situation to date ("They kill for one reason. They kill for food.") and brings us straight to "Today." Here, in a wasteland called Uniontown, next to a diner sign emblazoned with the word "EATS," Riley and his sidekick, Charlie (Robert Joy), watch as Big Daddy, dressed in a gas-station attendant's uniform, tries to go through the work motions. Riley is struck by the zombie's commitment to its old rituals; but what gets his attention is that this itinerant corpse seems to be communicating with other zombies.  A pioneer in the slow-zombie movement (think of him as the Alice Waters of contemporary horror), Mr. Romero has not joined the recent fad for zippy corpses, as seen in both "28 Days Later" and the remake of "Dawn of the Dead." Mr. Romero's monsters still move at a relatively lethargic pace, dragging their dead weight as if they were made of lead, not putrefying flesh. What has changed since corpses roamed the cemetery in "Night of the Living Dead" crudely pockmarked with sores and dripping movie blood is the special-effects makeup, which in the new film is alternately frightfully real and obscenely beautiful. Here, Mr. Romero, whose striking parking-lot exteriors in "Dawn of the Dead" looked like they were designed by Ed Ruscha, creates gruesome demons right out of Bosch and Goya.  The story more or less takes the shape of an extended chase scene, in which the living and the zombies alternate between their roles as hunters and hunted. Riley, who's anxious to split for Canada (where the film was actually shot), to find a land without borders and zombies, works salvaging supplies from outside the city. Inside an armored vehicle ordained  Dead Reckoning, he and his crew, whose numbers include Cholo (an exceptionally good John Leguizamo),  search the zombie-infested badlands for food and medical supplies. For Cholo and some of the others, there's much fun to be had popping wheelies on motorcycles while blowing holes through the zombies, even if the ghouls, still dressed in the clothes in which they died  - a cheerleader's outfit, a butcher's apron - look uncomfortably human.  Neither fully alive nor dead, zombies exist between the margins, in a twilight state that makes them among the most unsettling of all man-made creatures. That's the essential paradox of all zombie movies, but it's a paradox that has taken on increasing complexity in Mr. Romero's zombie quartet. In "Night of the Living Dead," the zombies were more or less indistinguishable rotting-meat puppets. Like animals, they were also beyond good and evil, eating simply because they were hungry. (And zombies, of course, are always hungry.) This first film centers on a cluster of people holed up in a farmhouse surrounded by the dead. The hero is a black man who tries to save everyone only to end up dead, shot by a posse that, as Mr. Romero makes clear in the devastating finale, is little more than a lynch mob.  With each of Mr. Romero's zombie movies, the walking dead have grown progressively more human while the living have slowly lost touch with their humanity. One thing that has always distinguished Mr. Romero's films, not only from the horror-genre pack but from so many action flicks, is that the director knows killing is killing. The chilling cackling of the posse at the end of "Night of the Living Dead" reverberates through the bombed-out landscapes in "Land of the Dead" from the start, as one zombie after another bites the dust. Mr. Romero can make you jump out of your seat with the best of them, but the greatest shock here may be the transformation of a black zombie into a righteous revolutionary leader (I guess Che really does live, after all).  With "Revenge of the Sith" and "Batman Begins," "Land of the Dead" makes the third studio release of the summer season to present an allegory, either naked or not, of our contemporary political landscape. Whatever else you think about these films, whether you believe them to be sincere or cynical, authentic expressions of defiance or just empty posturing, it is rather remarkable that these so-called popcorn movies have gone where few American films outside the realm of documentary, including most so-called independents, dare to go. One of the enormous pleasures of genre filmmaking is watching great directors push against form and predictability, as Mr. Romero does brilliantly in "Land of the Dead." One thing is for sure: You won't go home hungry.  "George A. Romero's Land of the Dead" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has extremely intense zombie violence with the usual buckets of blood.  George A.

George A. Romero shows 'em how it's done in "Land of the Dead," resurrecting his legendary franchise with top-flight visuals, terrific genre smarts and tantalizing layers of implication. Nerve-shredding fourth installment may not fully reclaim the visceral or satirical impact of the writer-director's 1978 masterpiece "Dawn of the Dead," but it's still a satisfyingly splattery feast of guts and ideas. Though Universal isn't flogging it half as aggressively as last year's "Dawn" remake, pic should grope its way to killer B.O. with no small help from Romero cultists, whose devotion will be nothing short of zombielike.
The horror maestro has come a long way since the third film in the cycle, 1985's "Day of the Dead," and an even longer way since his seminal 1968 classic "Night of the Living Dead." This time around, Romero is playing with bigger stars and a higher (though still modest) budget of about $15 million, as well as a new shooting location (Toronto, instead of his native Pittsburgh).
That said, "Land" is a tour de force of not only independent filmmaking but independent thinking, rigorously worked out on all craft and technical levels yet enlivened by its twisted engagement with the real world.
Romero's apocalyptic vision of an earth beset by endlessly self-perpetuating flesh-eaters remains as relevant and resonant as ever, and this time he's even injected some not-so-subtle political invective into the proceedings. At one point Kaufman, a corrupt, gray-haired city official, declares, "We don't negotiate with terrorists," making this the second actioner in recent months, after "Star Wars: Episode III -- Revenge of the Sith," to lob a grenade in the direction of the White House.
The city in question is one of humankind's last remaining holdouts, an island metropolis surrounded by water and electric fences that keep out the walking undead. Perched in a high tower that dominates the skyline, Kaufman (Dennis Hopper, his brow furrowed with self-entitlement) owns everything and everyone in the exclusive community of Fiddler's Green, advertised as the place "where life goes on," and where upper-class citizens are admitted only via waiting list. Those still outside on the streets, meanwhile, are in the early stages of revolution.
Cholo, one of several soldiers sent out on rescue missions to bring back food and supplies, sets things in motion when Kaufman refuses to let him move into Fiddler's Green. The disgruntled mercenary (a hot-headed John Leguizamo) promptly hijacks Dead Reckoning, an armored military vehicle that holds enough firepower to bomb out the city, which he threatens to do unless Kaufman meets his demands.
In response, Kaufman commissions Cholo's superior Riley (Simon Baker) to recover the stolen tank, accompanied by sharpshooter sidekick Charlie (Robert Joy) and gold-hearted hooker Slack (Asia Argento, putting a tough-talking spin on a familiar role).
Tension between Riley and Cholo, effectively fleshed out by Baker and especially Leguizamo, reps only one of the story's intriguing contrasts. Both guys want out of a nightmare situation, but where Riley hopes to start over away from civilization, social-climbing Cholo wants to retreat inside, into the ranks of the city's elite.
Romero clearly has a lot on his mind, working through issues of class, segregation, individualism and personal responsibility. As always, the scenario eerily and amusingly mirrors the times: Astute viewers will laugh at how the undead phenomenon has already become commercial fodder in the form of theme-park-style attractions and bloodsports. More chillingly, the gleaming facade of Fiddler's Green implies an entire nation struggling and failing to lead normal lives in a war zone, turning against itself in the process.
Most suggestive of all are the zombies themselves, who have become frighteningly resourceful and smart, having learned to communicate as well as use tools and weapons. Unlike the trendy, fast-moving denizens of the recent "Dawn" redux and "28 Days Later," Romero's walkers still shamble along slowly, yet with an increasingly purposeful gait that makes them seem all the more human. They also look more realistically undead than ever, thanks to pic's ace makeup team (led by Greg Nicotero) and special contact lenses that lend their eyes a bluish, otherworldly glaze.
Pic's ideas about continual evolution and advancement extend equally to the carnage, which for most auds will be "Land's" ultimate test. And Romero rises to the occasion with a mastery, discipline and gleeful sense of invention that shows just how far a slim budget can go given the right sensibility. Fans of the trademark spewing, sausage-like intestines will be quite appeased; few will be prepared for the semi-decapitated zombie (emphasis on semi) or the ugly disadvantages of having a pierced navel (you've been warned).
Romero has a way of at once honoring and updating modern horror-pic conventions, relying more here on shock cuts (with super-sharp editing by Michael Doherty) and surprise zombie ambushes than the queasy claustrophobia that pervaded "Night" and "Dawn." The upshot, happily, is a similarly blissful sense of unease.
Miroslaw Baszak's nuanced lensing, finding endless varieties in a predominantly gray palette, accentuates Arvinder Grewal's chilly production design at every turn. Reinhold Heil and Johnny Klimek's score is serviceably grim, with repeated patterns that evoke the restless walk of the damned.

What a world George Romero  has single-handedly given usnow four living-dead films, two remakes of those four, and 10,000 rip-offs all laboring around the simple idea of slow-walking, cannibalistic zombiehood. Zombies used to be merely mute slaves summoned from the grave by vodun; now and forever, they're Romero's dopey, latex-faced homo-vores, perpetually on the edge of signifying America, or class warfare, or capitalistic rapaciousness, or something . Since 9-11, I've seen no less than 13 new zombie films (not including Pirates of the Caribbean ); while Lacanian doctoral students unpack the phenomena, here's Romero's fourth episode, set at least a few months after Day of the Dead  and concerned, as Romero has been since he began commanding budgets, with new and squishy ways to eliminate the stumbling, decaying masses.
Romero has rarely ever been up to his own ideas, and after Night of the Living Dead , Martin , and The Crazies , ideas were hard to come by. Land of the Dead  is a knot of half-measures: The world has adapted to the plague of wandering flesh eaters, but only to the Wild West, shotgun-pumping extent of John Carpenter 's Escape  films. The zombies begin to learn thingshow to hold weapons, set fires, etc.but to only trudge doggedly on toward where the meat is. (Do they ever starve?) The golden opportunity to visit Richard Matheson 's I Am Legend , and have the zombies develop as a social force, is shot to hell.
Romero certainly tries to inject subtext: The center of the new civilization, defended by electric fences and armed guards, is a luxury skyscraper inhabited by the wealthy and owned by Bushy power-monger Dennis Hopper . The poor of the Pittsburghian city live in the decimated slum outside, serving the rich or merely indulging in vices, like betting on bear pit matches between the undead and unwilling human victims (in this case, rebel hooker Asia Argento ). Who exactly is the threatening proletariat in this scenariothe living poor or the ravenous undeadis never sussed out, but the self-serving elite are clear targets, down to Hopper's bigwig labeling John Leguizamo 's vengeful extortionist a "terrorist." Unfortunately, the story as such revolves around the stoic hero (Simon Baker ) retrieving Hopper's custom-built tank-truck (literally named Dead Reckoning ) from Leguizamo's opportunistic bad boy, and little more.
The foggy politics are still more sensible than any you could excavate from Batman Begins . Romero's fourth-grade dialogue doesn't help matters, but anyone seeking out the latest achievements in cranial ruptures, spewing-blood gouts, and ground-beef spillage need look no further. Times have changed. Cheap as a used pickup and raw to the touch, the original Night of the Living Dead  had an effortless relationship with its historical moment and still contains passages of claustrophobic suspense and bruising transgression. Today, with big money at stake, it's the makeup effects team that gets center stage.
