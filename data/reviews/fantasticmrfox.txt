Who'd have guessed it? Wes Anderson, creator of the rascally stop-motion fable Fantastic Mr. Fox , turns out to be born to make animated films. I say that with a bit of mischief, because I'm not a big fan of Anderson's work (Rushmore , The Darjeeling Limited ). What I now understand, though, is that in essence, he's always  been making cartoons; he just confused the issue by putting real live actors in them. Before, he twisted reality into a permanent ironic pose. Now, in the infectiously primitive talking-animal world of Fantastic Mr. Fox , he's become an ironic realist.
Freely adapting Roald Dahl's 1970 children's book, Anderson creates an endearingly tactile fairy-tale thrift-shop universe, with quaintly painted backdrops, cotton balls for smoke, and a family of foxes who move in such deliberate fashion that, up close, you can see the hairs on their faces bristle and jerk. Yet Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney), Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep), and their son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman), inhabit a world that's disarmingly, well, lifelike. There are jokes about flipped real estate (they move from a hole to a tree  i.e., an upscale condo), plus a very unchildlike soundtrack powered by the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones. As a hero, Mr. Fox has the arch self-possession to insist to his wife that he poaches poultry ''because I'm a wild animal.'' Against her wishes, he plots to rip off a trio of evil farmers, and the film turns into a modly surreal, underground-burrowing heist yarn, with Clooney as self-mockingly sympathetic as he is in the Ocean's  films. With its virtuoso tomfoolery, Fantastic Mr. Fox  is like a homegrown Wallace and Gromit caper. To Wes Anderson: More, please!


 Correction Appended  “Fantastic Mr. Fox” is a proudly analog animated entertainment,   making its handmade way into a marketplace glutted with digital goodies. Next to the three-dimensional, computer-generated creatures that swoop and soar off the screen these days, the furry talking animals on display here, with their matted pelts, jerky movements and porcelain eyes, might look a little quaint, like old-fashioned wind-up toys uneasily sharing the shelf with the latest video game platforms.  At times this adaptation of Roald Dahl’s  slender anti-fable  — truer to the spirit than to the letter of the source — does not even look like a movie. In spite of the pedigreed voices (Meryl Streep and Bill Murray, along with George Clooney in the title role), it feels more like an extended episode of what progressive educators call imaginative play. The sets might just as well have been built out of available household stuff, the stiff figurines animated and ventriloquized on a classroom or bedroom floor by precocious children.  All of which may only be another way of saying that this is a Wes Anderson film. The spirit of self-conscious juvenile playacting has informed his work from the start, providing a theme for “Rushmore” and a sensibility for everything else.  His live-action subjects often move like stop-motion figures through landscapes that resemble drawings and models more than real places. (Think of the cutaway ship set in “The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou.”) There is a deadpan, understated quality to his performers that also suggests puppetry, and he shows a stubborn reluctance to let story take precedence over style.  So “Fantastic Mr. Fox,” which Mr. Anderson wrote with Noah Baumbach, and which he has been hoping to make for many years, is in some ways his most fully realized and satisfying film. Once you adjust to its stop-and-start rhythms and its scruffy looks, you can appreciate its wit, its beauty and the sly gravity of its emotional undercurrents. The work done by the animation director, Mark Gustafson, by the director of photography, Tristan Oliver, and by the production designer, Nelson Lowry, shows amazing ingenuity and skill, and the music (by Alexandre Desplat, with the usual shuffle of well-chosen pop tunes, famous and obscure) is both eccentric and just right.  Is it is a movie for children? This inevitable question depends on the assumption that children have uniform tastes and expectations. How can that be? And besides, the point  of everything Mr. Anderson has ever done is that truth and beauty reside in the odd, the mismatched, the idiosyncratic. He makes that point  in ways that are sometimes touching, sometimes annoying, but usually worth arguing about. Not everyone will like “Fantastic Mr. Fox”; and if everyone did, it would not be nearly as interesting as it is. There are some children — some people — who will embrace it with a special, strange intensity, as if it had been made for them alone.  Roald Dahl’s books, suspicious of authority and repelled by conformity, full of unruly energy and wanton invention, have a similar appeal, though Dahl’s imagination was more aggressive than Mr. Anderson’s. The director has made the material his own by winding some of his characteristic preoccupations around the spare, spiky architecture of the book, turning Dahl’s tale of woodland derring-do into another melancholy, comical study of the dynamics of a loving, difficult family.  The patriarch, old Foxy himself, is a charmer and a scapegrace, perhaps not as floridly untrustworthy as Royal Tenenbaum, but not exactly a paragon of responsibility either. After a few near misses — and with a newly pregnant missus (Ms. Streep) — Mr. Fox retired  from the hazardous business of poultry killing and went into newspaper journalism. In enchanted talking-animal fairyland, that is apparently a thriving profession, and those of us in journalism who soon may be stealing chickens out of desperation may envy Mr. Fox the luxury of doing it  for love.  A sense of thwarted ambition — perhaps something of a vulpine midlife crisis — sends him back into the fortified feedlots and coops of Boggis, Bunce and Bean, the three farmers immortalized in schoolyard rhymes as “horrible crooks, so different in looks” who are “nonetheless equally mean.” The voice of Bean, their nasty, cider-drinking ringleader, is supplied by Michael Gambon, and their escalating response to Mr. Fox’s raid supplies the movie with its basic narrative engine. Will they succeed in catching Mr. Fox and his friends? Or will he brilliantly escape their diabolical designs?  The answers to these questions are not really in doubt, and perhaps for that reason Mr. Anderson and Mr. Baumbach often seem to lose interest in them. Instead they delve into the social and familial relationships that define Mr. Fox’s world, with particular attention to the  rivalry between the Foxes’ only son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman), and a visiting cousin named Kristofferson (Eric Anderson).  Kristofferson is a golden child, handsome and athletic, with the special sadness that in Mr. Anderson’s universe, is the burden of the gifted. Ash, meanwhile, is both jealous of his cousin and unsure of his father’s love.  And the father manages, in his charming way, to endanger the lives of everyone dear to him — not only his family, but also friends, like Badger (Mr. Murray) and Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky), an opossum who becomes Fox’s accomplice. Fox’s recklessness is part of his magnetic appeal, of course, but it also strains his marriage and shadows him with an ethical ambiguity unusual in a children’s movie.  Which maybe this isn’t after all. (There is one scene, in which a character dies a violent death, that may be too chilling for some younger viewers to handle.) But at the same time it is  precisely the movie that a child smitten with Roald Dahl’s fiction and fascinated by the enigmas of the adult world would dream of making: something to amaze and terrify the grown-ups and win the envy and adulation of his peers.  “Fantastic Mr. Fox” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has danger, sorrow and an awareness of mortality.  FANTASTIC MR.

So old-fashioned as to look like something brand new, the stop-motion-animated "Fantastic Mr. Fox" is as recognizably a Wes Anderson film as any of his previous features. Roald Dahl's 1970 children's favorite about a fox clan and friends eluding human predators has been transformed into a tale of odd family dynamics stemming from the behavior of an eccentric patriarch. The film's style, paradoxically both precious and rough-hewn, positions this as the season's defiantly anti-CGI toon, and its retro charms will likely appeal more strongly to grown-ups than to moppets; it's a picture for people who would rather drive a 1953 Jaguar XK 120 than a new one. B.O. for this Fox release will no doubt be closer to that of "Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" than of "Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs."
The second talking-fox picture of the year, after Lars von Trier's "Antichrist," this one features not genital mutilation, but a leading character who gets his tail shot off. It also boasts some of the most gorgeous autumnal color schemes devised by someone other than Mother Nature herself, animal puppets festooned with actual fur, and a sensibility more indie-rarefied than mainstream.
It�s a curious coincidence that Anderson and Spike Jonze, two of the young auteurs who came to prominence around the late �90s, have kid-lit adaptations featuring puppets (albeit of vastly differing sizes) coming out simultaneously, and that both �Mr. Fox� and �Where the Wild Things Are� strive for such hand-crafted, individualized looks. The films may have their problems, but the least one can say is that neither very closely resembles anything that�s come before.
"Mr. Fox" is characterized by chapter headings that slide across the screen; trademark Anderson compositions that resemble storyboards and abundant lateral camera moves; a soundtrack that easily accommodates everything from "The Ballad of Davy Crockett" and the theme from "Day for Night" to the Beach Boys' version of "Ol' Man River"; and a hirsute male lead who would look right at home on the cover of GQ.
Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) wears a double-breasted, pumpkin-colored corduroy suit, a custard-hued sweater and two stylish wheat stalks peeking out of his breast pocket. His slim, trim wife (Meryl Streep) complements him perfectly, and when he tells her, "You're still as fine-looking as a creme brulee," Anderson's sophisticated following will nod with pleasure while their kids think, "What the heck?"
As in Dahl's 81-page yarn -- whose pencil-sketch illustrations by Quentin Blake (in some editions) could not be more different from Anderson's fastidious visuals -- Mr. Fox's pelt is desperately desired by three nasty farmers whose produce he regularly poaches. Boggis and Bunce and Bean, "one fat, one short, one lean," launch all-out war on their adversary, digging down into his lair before recruiting snipers to shoot on sight.
The geological precision with which Fox and his friends'great escape is presented reps one of the film's visual highlights, as they furiously dig through layer after layer of earth to stay ahead of their enemies' onslaught. Along the way, Fox burrows up into the three men's properties, from which he pilfers enough to prepare a giant feast, while the war continues to the point of becoming a televised siege.
But the overarching drama doesn't interest Anderson and fellow screenwriter Noah Baumbach nearly as much as the family issues. In contrast to the book, in which the Foxes have four largely undifferentiated kids, here they have but one son, Ash (Jason Schwartzman), who isn't sure he can meet his father's expectations. Joining them in flight are unassertive cousin Kristofferson (Eric Anderson), opossum Kylie (Wally Wolodarsky) and lawyer Badger (Bill Murray). Plainly set in England, the film maintains a linguistic divide between British-accented humans and American-accented animals.
The thematic thread here pertains to the maintenance of one's true personality and character strengths. When they have a child, Mrs. Fox gets her husband to promise to cease being a wild thing (apologies to Jonze) and become respectable. When he subsequently reverts to his old, buccaneering ways, Mr. Fox must do so surreptitiously, and when he's caught in a lie, his wife is deeply distraught that he hasn't really changed.
But it's his true character that wins the day, and it's a trait Anderson clearly advocates through his own choices. Employing a deliberately unpolished, herky-jerky style that traces back specifically to Ladislas Starevich's 1941 "The Tale of the Fox" but also variously recalls the imperfect but imperishable stop-motion techniques in the silent "The Lost World," the original "King Kong," the work of Ray Harryhausen, Norman McLaren's "A Chairy Tale" and many others, the film achieves a feel that is at once coarse-grained and elegant, antiquated and the height of fashion.
That said, individual scenes often go off in irritatingly self-indulgent directions, especially when they brush upon lifestyle issues, meditation timeouts and too-cute observations.
Much is being made of reports that Anderson was not physically present during the film's actual making in London, that he directed by remote links from Paris. It's also a matter of record that Henry Selick, who created stop-motion sequences for Anderson's "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou," was originally slated to co-direct "Fantastic Mr. Fox." Whatever the case, Anderson's indelible imprint is on every frame here, more for better than for worse.
All craft aspects are aces.

Given his preference for static, symmetrical, scrupulously color-coordinated and art-directed compositions, it's less surprising that Wes Anderson  has gotten around to directing an animated feature than that it took him this long to do it. Likewise, if Anderson—a nostalgia merchant whose ostensibly contemporary films always seem to be unfolding in some irrecoverable past—was going to do a cartoon, then surely he was bound to favor the handcrafted rigors of stop-motion over the lifeless perfection of so much CGI.
Film studies majors, cultural anthropologists, and Sunday arts section editors will surely have their hands full comparing and contrasting Anderson's fast-paced, visually majestic Fantastic Mr. Fox , which is based on the 1970 book by Roald Dahl , to the season's other high-art kiddie-lit adaptation, Spike Jonze 's Where the Wild Things Are . Question to look out for: Is this sudden renaissance of auteur-driven children's films (Tim Burton 's Alice in Wonderland  looming on the horizon) a by-product of Generation-Y's willful refusal to grow up?
Never mind that so much beloved children's literature is itself the product of fully grown men and women using the prism of childhood or fantasy to exorcise their own personal demons. When Dahl sat down to write Fantastic Mr. Fox , he had already lost one of his five children to measles and witnessed another suffer from water on the brain as the result of a car accident. Understandably, the book that resulted was a portrait of a father as family protector—the literal hunter-gatherer who must find new ways of putting food on the table after the three odious farmers, whose bounty Mr. Fox has regularly raided, get wise to his game. True to Dahl's temperament, the book was incredibly dark by turns, yet relatively straightforward: Mr. Fox was a fox, his human predators human, and never the twain should meet.
Anderson—working with his Life Aquatic  writing partner, Noah Baumbach —has blurred those lines and added an existential layer to his protagonist's conundrum. Onscreen, Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney ) is now a corduroy-clad gentleman bandit who walks upright and steals not out of necessity but because he's good at it. Fast-forward to several "fox years" later, and Mr. Fox has, at the behest of Mrs. Fox (Meryl Streep ), traded his life of crime for a career as a newspaper columnist and the comforts of the life domestic. But in his heart, he remains footloose and fancy-free, looking to make one last score. "Who am I? Why a fox?" he asks, literally stating the film's unanswerable question. "And can a fox ever be happy without a chicken in its teeth?" Where Dahl's book was essentially a survival story, Anderson's film has become a non-conformist fable about that wildness of spirit (our animal instincts, if you will) we are encouraged to tame as we get older and "settle down."
Like Jonze, Anderson and Baumbach have done much else to expand and personalize the source material without violating its spirit, turning Dahl's effectively stable nuclear family into a more eccentric and passive-aggressive one, with Mr. Fox a reckless, self-absorbed paterfamilias in the Royal Tenenbaum/Steve Zissou mold, his four offspring condensed into a single moody, misfit teenager (named Ash and voiced by Jason Schwartzman ) with significant daddy issues. Like the similar adolescent males whom Baumbach evoked with such empathy in The Squid and the Whale  and Margot at the Wedding —their bodies changing at a frightening pace, the world's cruel realities assaulting them at fastball speed—the uncoordinated, diminutive Ash finds himself in the grips of his own existential dilemma, exacerbated by the arrival of his golden-boy cousin, Kristofferson. If the characters and crises sound a touch familiar, however, Anderson works through them with a sensitivity that was largely absent from both Darjeeling  and The Life Aquatic , where style frequently overwhelmed substance and the characters appeared far less dimensional than Mr. Fox 's plasticine avatars.
For the reportedly painstaking labor it took to create, the film is a marvel to behold—with wonderful shifts in perspective, an intensely tactile design, and an intentional herky-jerkiness of motion that only enriches the make-believe atmosphere. Clooney (speaking as if everything were a self-conscious aside) and Streep (resplendent as a former wildcat turned Earth mother) do some of the best work of their illustrious careers. Among the movie's many virtues, they render an unusually convincing portrait of a marriage, a reminder that the most unexpected thing about Anderson's film may be—underneath all the carefully affixed, wind-sensitive whiskers and fur—how deeply human it is.
