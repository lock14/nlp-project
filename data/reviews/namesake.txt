         Indian-born, New York-based director Mira Nair has repeatedly enacted tales of culture clash in her films but never with quite as much warmth and thoughtfulness as she brings to "The Namesake."
 
 Coming off a botched literary adaptation — the garbled, proto-feminist take on William Makepeace Thackeray's "Vanity Fair" — she turns her attention to a novel that is not only more manageably scaled but also, for this expatriate filmmaker, surely closer to home. Jhumpa Lahiri's 2003 book-club favorite spans decades, continents and generations, but it's also an intimate, melancholy look at the isolation and disorientation common to the immigrant experience.
 


         






   The saga of the Ganguli family begins with the arranged marriage in 1970s Calcutta between studious engineer Ashoke (Irrfan Khan) and shy classical singer Ashima (Tabu). The newlyweds relocate immediately to New York, where Ashoke is pursuing his master's degree. Strangers to each other and to their surroundings, they gradually discover a tender mutual rapport and even an ambivalent comfort in this foreign land. Before long they have a son, a daughter and a house in the suburbs.
 
 The naming of the Gangulis' first-born provides the metaphorical backbone of the book and the movie. Pressured to pick a name before leaving the hospital — contrary to Bengali convention, which dictates the use of a familial "pet name" and later the adoption of an official "good name" — they settle on Gogol, an homage to Ashoke's favorite author.
 
 In due course, Gogol (played from young adulthood on by Kal Penn) finds his name all too distinctive and opts instead for Nikhil (often conveniently Westernized as Nick). The tensions that bedevil the characters in "The Namesake" are textbook conflicts of melting-pot America. Gogol's two names are an unsubtle but potent symbol of his double identity. He's a typical American teen, ritually distancing himself from parental influence, but as with many second-generation immigrants, his youthful rebellion can spiral into the rejection of an entire way of life.
 
 Later, as a twentysomething Manhattan architect, he finds that his unresolved sense of identity is affecting, among other things, his love life. The doting WASP girlfriend (Jacinda Barrett) and her snobbish moneyed parents represent ultimate assimilation, but he settles down with a mirror image of himself: a modern, independent Bengali woman (Zuleikha Robinson) who naturally brings her own baggage to their relationship.
 
 The muted elegance of Lahiri's prose appears to have had a bracing effect on Nair's filmmaking, which has never been a model of economy. The film is full of deft visual cues that underscore its themes of connection and dislocation. Shots of the Queensboro Bridge in New York are rhymed with those of the Howrah Bridge in Calcutta. Several significant scenes take place in the in-between spaces of airport terminals.
 
 The book is driven more by incident than by plot, and Nair's largely faithful adaptation suffers at times from an episodic choppiness. Still, the lack of obvious narrative arcs is refreshing. Instead of melodramatic implausibilities what we get is the commonplace stuff of life: marriages and breakups, births and deaths.
 
 Bollywood veterans Khan and Tabu, as the elder Gangulis, tap into considerable reserves of depth and subtlety, and this should be a breakout role for Kal Penn, holding the dramatic center of a film for the first time. His Gogol is a funnier and more believable creation than the book's, in part because to play the teen malcontent, the actor has shrewdly imported aspects of the pothead persona he popularized in "Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle."
 
 Despite being rooted in knotty issues of identity, Lahiri's novel forgoes didacticism in favor of vivid portraiture. Nair and her uniformly superb cast take the same tack: The characters are individuals before they are emblems.
 
 "The Namesake." MPAA rating: PG-13 for sexuality/nudity, a scene of drug use, some disturbing images and brief language. Running time: 2 hours, 2 minutes.   

When a director is as humane as Mira Nair (Monsoon Wedding ), it's easy to think of her gift as the ''simple'' ability to bathe everyone on screen in a glow of understanding. Nair's work is certainly empathic (and also funny and sexy and rueful), yet watching The Namesake , her moving and marvelous new cross-cultural family saga, I was struck by the nearly sculptural skill with which she expresses that spirit  her arrangement, for instance, of people in a suburban kitchen, so that their intimacy is offset by the way they stare into their cereal bowls, or how a father's love for his son is conveyed powerfully by his devout refusal to say it.
Based on the best-selling novel by Jhumpa Lahiri, The Namesake  is set in New York and Calcutta over a period of several decades. It's one of those adaptations that's so sprawling and episodic and crammed with incident that, at times, you may wish you were reading the novel. The film opens in India in 1974 with a fateful train crash, then leaps ahead three years, when the studious and quizzical Ashoke (Irrfan Khan) meets the young beauty, Ashima (Tabu), it has been arranged for him to wed. (She likes him for his American shoes.) Eager for a new life, he takes her to the U.S., where they have two children and make a home in the New York suburbs. We're set for a cozy tale of assimilation, but the film then leaps ahead to their son, Gogol (Kal Penn)  named  for his father's favorite author  as a surly, dope-smoking high schooler who couldn't be more embarrassed by his parents' doting immigrant ways.
It was bold of Nair to cast Penn, the deadpan comic star of Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle , in the complex role of Gogol, whose love-hate, push-pull relationship with his heritage forms the spiritual core of the story. Penn turns out to be a fantastic actor. His sexy, cool surface works for the film  Gogol is a Bengali American who knows, righteously, that he's as homegrown as Mickey Mantle  yet Penn's eyes are full of fury and desire, and they mirror the film's primal question: In a country where we can invent ourselves anew, how does family define us?
Penn plays Gogol as a thicket of warring impulses. He's inspired to be an architect by  a visit to the Taj Mahal, yet back in America, he declares his independence by falling for a  wealthy blue-blood princess (Jacinda Barrett). Just as the audience is sure that it's in for the sort of cross-cultural clash that has defined every ethnic-romantic saga from Fiddler on the Roof  to Monsoon Wedding , it's Gogol, spurred by tragedy, who decides to ''stick with his own kind,'' only to learn that even that's not as easy as he thinks. Penn, who has a gift for letting feelings burn through his skin, shows you the conflicts roiling around inside him, and Khan and Tabu, both superstars of Bollywood, turn his parents into figures of touchingly diffident devotion. The Namesake  is sometimes too sketchy  you want more of the episodes, never less  yet it's a movie that will speak to anyone who has ever felt pulled in different directions by his own heart.

 Color is the stuff of life in the movies of Mira Nair, the Indian-born director whose newest film, “The Namesake,” follows two generations of a Bengali family from late-1970s Calcutta to New York City. Her lush palette lends her films a throbbing physicality that invites you to step into the screen and embrace the sensuous here and now.  “The Namesake,” adapted from Jhumpa Lahiri’s popular novel, conveys a palpable sense of people as living, breathing creatures who are far more complex than their words might indicate. The story of upwardly mobile immigrants torn between tradition and modernity as they are absorbed into the American melting pot has been told in countless movies.  This variation is gentle and compassionate. The longing for roots of these displaced middle-class Indians lends a soulful undertow to a film conspicuously lacking in melodrama.  Ms. Nair has a sympathetic collaborator in Sooni Taraporevala, the Indian screenwriter who also wrote her first two features, “Salaam Bombay!” (1988) and “Mississippi Masala” (1991). Its steady, unhurried pace, its fascination with the rituals of daily life and its deep respect for characters who are continually evolving lift “The Namesake” above high-end soap opera. It may lack epic grandeur, but by the end you feel you know these people well enough to keep in step with their internal rhythms.  The film has a crackling star performance by Kal Penn (from the clever trash comedy “Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle”), who brings an offhanded charisma to the role of Gogol, the first-born child of Ashima (Tabu), a classically trained singer, and Ashoke Ganguli (Irrfan Khan), an aspiring engineer, who move to America in 1977 after their arranged marriage in Calcutta.  Alone together in a foreign land in the middle of winter, the shy, polite newlyweds are virtual strangers, and the movie captures their delicate process of mutual accommodation. Ashima’s initiation into American culture has gentle, humorous moments. She is astonished to discover gas stoves that work 24 hours a day and learns the hard way that wool sweaters should not be dumped into a washing machine.  A prologue looks back to a turning point in Ashoke’s life. During a train trip in 1974 to visit his grandfather, a friendly stranger advises him to leave India and see the world. Ashoke is reading “The Overcoat,” the famous story by the Russian writer Nikolai Gogol, who spent much of his life outside his homeland. When the train crashes later in the trip, Ashoke miraculously survives, and the Gogol story becomes a totem in his life, a symbolic tie to his homeland and an omen of good luck.  Years later when his son is born, Ashoke is told that the baby cannot leave the hospital without a name. In India several years might pass before a child is given a formal name, chosen by the maternal grandmother. Ashoke impulsively calls his son Gogol. As the boy grows up, his ambivalence about his temporary name, which he embraces, then rejects (his formal name is Nikhil), becomes a metaphor for his divided cultural identity.  In high school Gogol rebels from his family and behaves like a typical pot-smoking, rock-’n’-roll-loving American teenager. On a visit to Calcutta he sneers at Indian ways. After studying architecture at Yale, he falls in love with Maxine (Jacinda Barrett), a stereotypical blonde WASP princess from Long Island. Cultural tensions flare when he brings her home to meet his family, and the couple are expected to withhold any expressions of physical affection, according to Indian tradition.  Gogol eventually falls in love with Moushumi (Zuleikha Robinson), a beautiful Bengali woman who lived a freewheeling life in Paris before coming to the United States. His female counterpart, she is as culturally confused as he is, and the relationship runs into trouble.  Despite all the tensions in the Ganguli household, “The Namesake” expresses a reassuring faith in family solidarity. Avoiding the cliché of pitting disobedient immigrant children in pitched battles against tradition-bound parents from the old country, the film assumes that blood ties are the strongest bonds holding together the social order.  In the second half of the movie the Ganguli parents step into the background as the focus shifts to Gogol. But instead of disappearing, Ashoke and Ashima loom as dignified, stabilizing pillars of tolerance and devotion whom their son and his younger sister, Sonia (Sahira Nair), cherish, even as they reject the old ways.  “The Namesake” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild sexual situations.

In the capable hands of director Mira Nair (bouncing back from the critically and commercially disappointing "Vanity Fair"), Jhumpa Lahiri's wildly popular novel about two generations of a Bengali family receives a loving, deeply felt screen translation that should appease fans of the book while making many new converts. Bolstered by Nair's lush visual style and superb performances from ace Bollywood thesps Irrfan Khan, Tabu and "Harold & Kumar" star Kal Penn (in his first dramatic lead), Fox Searchlight can expect above-average arthouse business for this audience-pleasing March release.
Though the condensing of Lahiri's episodic, decades-spanning narrative into two compact hours of screen-time makes for a pic occasionally overstuffed with incident, "The Namesake" remains a richly compelling story of family and self-discovery.
Tale begins in Calcutta in the late 1970s, where a young man, Ashoke (Khan), who has recently survived a horrific train accident, enters into an arranged marriage with the beautiful Ashima (Tabu), whom he has never met before. Together, they travel to New York City, where they settle in a ramshackle cold-water flat and begin their new American lives.
Despite all the modern conveniences of a big U.S. city -- in one scene, Ashima excitedly writes home that, in America, one can use the gas 24 hours a day -- the adjustment is a difficult one, and these early scenes are particularly impressive for the subtlety with which Nair and her actors map out the lives of two people who are strangers to each other acclimating to life in a strange land.
When Ashima gives birth to a baby boy, she and Ashoke are informed that, counter to Indian custom -- where years sometimes pass before a child is given a proper name -- the baby must be named before it can leave the hospital. So, they settle on the "good name" of Nikhil and the "pet name" of Gogol, after Ashoke's favorite writer.
But several years later, on Nikhil/Gogol's first day of elementary school, the boy decides to continue going by Gogol, in effect making that his "good name." It is a choice that reverberates throughout the rest of the film, as the sense of a name -- and the history it carries with it -- becomes a lyrical metaphor for the character's own struggle to assert his identity.
Cut to a modern-day high school classroom, where Gogol (now played by Penn) is a moody, shaggy-haired, pot-smoking senior, predictably furious at his parents for giving him such a dumb name. This Gogol is as American as they come, as evidenced by his bratty behavior during a family vacation to India, where he consistently disparages the country for its evident backwardness; and later, by his romance with a WASP-y Manhattan princess (Jacinda Barrett), who invites Gogol (now known as "Nick") for weekends at Oyster Bay and says things like "Everyone loves truffles."
Culture-clash moments like those border on cliche, especially since Barrett's character isn't developed much beyond her surface of moneyed privilege. Better drawn is Gogol's subsequent girlfriend, a fellow Bengali named Moushumi (sultry Zuleikha Robinson), who, like Gogol himself, finds herself torn between obeisance to tradition and pursuing her own desires.
If that conflict isn't exactly new in cinema, it's nevertheless rendered by "The Namesake" with a sensitivity and emotional resonance that elude most films on the subject of cultural assimilation. That's largely thanks to the delicate balance Nair and screenwriter Sooni Taraporevala strike between the story's two generational threads, so that Ashima and Ashoke remain significant presences in the second half, even after the primary focus shifts to Nick/Gogol.
Penn -- who has long seemed one of the brightest and most likable young comic talents around -- shows serious dramatic chops as he takes us on Nick/Gogol's expansive odyssey from the proverbial American-Born Confused Desi to a confident young man with a sure sense of his past, his present and his future.
Shot on location in New York and India, pic boasts excellent tech contributions on all fronts, particularly the warm, rich colors of Frederick Elmes' cinematography and Stephanie Carroll's production design, and the varied Western and Eastern influences of composer/DJ Nitin Sawhney's original score.

Packed with female book club members, a screening of Mira Nair 's The Namesake  left no doubt about the film's target audienceyet it seems a pity to confine the movie behind the bars of a chick flick. Dividing its time between the fortunes of a Bengali immigrant to New York and those of her anxiously Americanized son, The Namesake  combines the intimate pleasures of a family saga with a finely sustained inquiry into the difficult balance between separation and integration that shapes the lives of first-generation immigrants and their children in crucially different ways.
This is home turf for Nair and screenwriter Sooni Taraporevala , two South Asian expatriates who previously collaborated on the exuberant charmer Mississippi Masala , an unexpected hit whose sneaky gift for laying the burden of weirdness on the host culture helped put Nair on the map. The Namesake  carries faint echoes of the carnal physicality that makes Nair's more lightweight movies so much fun to look atMonsoon Wedding  was a dandy piece of froth, and Vanity Fair   survives only  on its looksbut it's a quieter, more mature work.
Based on a first novel by Jhumpa Lahiri , whose short-story collection Interpreter of Maladies  won her a Pulitzer, The Namesake  is a study in hot and cold as it moves between the heat and dust of Calcutta  and the ice and slush of Queens, New York , where Ashima (played by the Indian star Tabu) lands with her new husband Ashoke (Irfan Khan ), a cerebral engineer she knows only from their arranged marriage. Still, their love blossoms as lonely, isolated Ashima grudgingly makes concessions to this strange American world of washing machines and overflowing supermarkets. Soon the couple moves to the suburbs, where they become part of the Indian diaspora community that maintains its links to the old country while prospering in the new.
Not so her restless son, hell bent on becoming a hip American and rushing into the arms of a bohemian shiksa. Best known for his antic turn in the comedy Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle , Kal Penn  tones down the goofiness just enough to lend an air of pathos to this gangly outsider who's stranded between two worlds, neither of which feels like home. Like many children of immigrants, he channels all his resentment into a profound loathing for his foreign name, Gogol Ganguli.
Though The Namesake  never fully resolves the episodic formlessness of Lahiri's novel, there's method and meaning in its loose ends, which both define the predicament of the second-generation immigrant and confer on him a strategic advantage in navigating modern urban life. When we leave Gogol, he's still figuring out the immigrant's eternal dance between tradition and modernity, between adapting to the new world and longing for roots. Only now he understands that the dance never ends.
