Named for the traditional Chinese color of good luck, the gentle indie drama Red Doors  is really more in the rosy pink range of the color palette than a more primary emotional hue. Although the Chinese-American Wong family can boast an impressive range of modern crises  big sis is about to marry a yuppie bore, middle sis falls for an actress, dad's a serial suicide attempter, etc.  writer-director Georgia Lee never leaves any doubt that the bonds of ethnic family devotion are a charm against any woe more serious than an engagement to the wrong white guy.

 In “Red Doors,” the oceanic divide between generations in a Chinese-American family is epitomized by the relationship of its glum paterfamilias, Ed Wong (Tzi Ma), and Katie (Kathy Shao-Lin Lee), the youngest of his three daughters. A 60-year-old retiree who sits around watching old home movies of his little girls, Ed has plunged into a suicidal funk. But every time he begins to act on his self-destructive urges, Katie barges in on him, barely noticing his distress.  On one occasion she interrupts him as he is tightening a noose around his neck. On another she appears as he is reclining in a bathtub with razor blades at his side. Her obliviousness to his pain would be unsettling if “Red Doors” weren’t a comedy. But this agreeable, lightweight movie, written and directed by Georgia Lee, turns the malaises of a suburban family into bittersweet farce that teeters between cheeky humor and surface pathos.  Ultimately “Red Doors” (the title refers to the Wongs’ red front door, whose color is supposed to bring good luck) loses its nerve and wraps up its interlocking family crises in a cozy blanket of reassurance.  Katie’s personal behavior is as extreme as her father’s. A ferociously headstrong high school student who wears her hair in two jutting pigtails, she leads a hip-hop dance troupe in school and, to her parents’ annoyance, pumps rap into her ears at the dinner table. Those dinners are traditional Chinese meals passed around on a Lazy Susan.  Katie is consumed by her treacherous quasiromantic pas de deux with Simon (Sebastian Stan), a fellow high school student who lives next door and with whom she has never spoken a word. Acutely aware of each other but silent by tacit agreement, these teenagers, who exchange meaningful poker-faced looks when they pass each other in the halls, are engaged in a tit-for-tat war in which they play increasingly grisly practical jokes on each other.  He sends her a present of a dead rodent. She drops a burning bag of dog feces on his doorstep. After igniting a small explosion in his school locker, this teenage caricature of the Asian woman warrior with American junk culture in her blood is given a warning by school authorities.  Each of the three Wong sisters exemplifies a different mode of cultural assimilation. Samantha (Jacqueline Kim), the eldest, is the dutiful high achiever. A successful businesswoman, she is engaged to be married to Mark (Jayce Bartok), an Ivy League yuppie whom the movie unabashedly despises. Samantha still carries a torch for her old boyfriend Alex (Rossif Sutherland), a drippy singer-songwriter with patches of facial hair who regards her with a moist cow-eyed longing.  The shy middle sister, Julie (Elaine Kao), is a medical student who begins to emerge from her shell when Mia Scarlett (Mia Riverton), a flirtatious television starlet visiting the hospital to study for a role, puts the moves on her after Julie helps her through the trauma of seeing a chest cut open. Julie is besotted with this Angelina Jolie-manqué, until the star treats her carelessly; then Julie shows her mettle.  “Red Doors” pulls together three well-worn subgenres of independent cinema. The moldiest is the suburbia-as-hell cliché that was revived by “American Beauty” and whose solemnity “Red Doors” tries to subvert with humor. The second is the drama of cultural assimilation within several generations of a family and the tension between the puritanical old ways and the freewheeling new ones. In these movies (“Red Doors” included) it often boils down to the choice of a wedding dress. Finally there is the coming-out story.  If these three subgenres are folded together comfortably in “Red Doors,” which is handsomely photographed, they don’t add up to something larger than the sum of their parts.  “Red Doors” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian); it has sexual situations.

Georgia Lee, in her feature bow, presents a lightly feminist, good-naturedly comic sketch of a Chinese-American family in crisis. But despite pic's earnestness and obvious good intentions, narrative elements, carefully set forth though they may be, fall back on overfamiliar, underdeveloped tropes. Nevertheless, upbeat pic, which snared NYNY prize at Tribeca, could find sympathetic auds on the fest route and cable.
When the family's newly retired father (Tzi Ma) runs off to a monastery, the women of the house are forced to re-evaluate their lives. Workaholic eldest sister (Jacqueline Kim) contacts an old folk-singing flame on the eve of her marriage to her yuppie lover; baby sis (Kathy Shao-Lin Lee) escalates her somewhat inexplicable, explosive sneak attacks against the boy next door; and shy medical student Julie (Elaine Kao) comes out of the closet to take up with a sexy starlet. Tech credits are pro, but scenes rarely evolve either organically or stylistically. Except for Tzi Ma, who brings his own rhythms and comic timing to the role of the video-watching patriarch cast seems mired in exposition.

This suburban-family comedy, which plays out in the landscape of Chinese American assimilation, is everything you'd expect from a frosh-indie effort: stilted dialogue, oversimplified relationships, sitcommy goofiness, and cringe-inducing romances. And yet Red Doors  is so well-meaning, with such obvious affection for its characters, that it pleases nonetheless. The Wong family has three daughters: Samantha (Jacqueline Kim ), an angular corporate achiever engaged to be married to same; Julie (Elaine Kao ), a med student ensnared by a famous actress doing method work at the hospital; and Katie (Kathy Shao-Lin  Lee ), a high schooler caught in an escalating prank war with a neighbor boy. When father Ed (Tzi Ma ) skips town for a Buddhist monastery, the family is thrown into upheaval, or at least into plot developments. Writer-director Georgia Lee has burdened her film with ill-conceived details and flat-falling gags, but her charactersespecially the appealingly warm Juliesurvive.
