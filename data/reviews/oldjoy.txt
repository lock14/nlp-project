One man (Daniel London) faces impending fatherhood, the other (Will Oldham) still clings to a notion of carefree, unencumbered drift. And what begins for these two longtime pals as a weekend mountain camping trip becomes in Old Joy , filmmaker Kelly Reichardt's shimmering, quiet treasure of a film, an elegy to mutable friendship, enduring nature, and the sense of loss that inevitably accompanies the adult pull to move forward. It's in all the moments where little happens that Reichardt is most amazing, investing even a gas-station pit stop with perfect emotional pitch.

 There are roughly 90 viewing days left till Christmas. By that point most of the big studio movies will have opened for the consideration of the paying public and Academy Award voters, and untold numbers of words will have been spilled about the same handful of serviceable or perhaps even brilliant films of the sort that dominate the discourse every fall. Odds are that none of those contenders will capture the tenor of these difficult times with more sensitivity or greater attention to beauty than Kelly Reichardt’s “Old Joy,” a triumph of modesty and of seriousness that also happens to be one of the finest American films of the year.  Based on a short story by Jonathan Raymond, who wrote the screenplay with Ms. Reichardt, the film tracks two old friends, Mark (Daniel London) and Kurt (Will Oldham), as they drive out of Portland, Ore., one day and into a strained reunion. As Mark, who’s about to become a father, drives, and Kurt keeps the pot pipe going, they talk about old times,   burning up memories and miles. They lose their way, the sun sinks, they set up camp. The next morning, they hike deep into the woods, where they find the professed reason for their getaway, a natural hot spring. There, amid the bubbling water and gentle whirs and hums of the forest, one of the friends struggles to recover something that had gone lost,  namely a sense of the other.  Much like Ms. Reichardt’s first feature, “River of Grass” (1995),  about a young woman who dreams of escaping her dreary life by going on the lam,  “Old Joy” briefly borrows the conventions of the road movie while keeping its romance safely at bay. Quintessentially if not exclusively American, the road movie often involves a flight to freedom, however illusory the freedom and truncated the trip. In “River of Grass” the woman ends her journey on a congested freeway, another gerbil spinning her wheels. Her desire for something more, some transcendence out of her ordinary existence, gives “River of Grass” a bittersweet tang. Ten years later, and Ms. Reichardt has little sweetness left for “Old Joy.”  What she does have in great supply are beauty and feeling, which is why this trip isn’t the bummer it might seem. Ms. Reichardt answers the deep current of sorrow that runs through the film and the lingering sense of regret that hangs over the men with one pristinely framed image after another. Working with her cinematographer, Peter Sillen, she offers up a world of enchantments that, along with Kurt’s fumbling confessions of friendship, create a counter-narrative to despair. Garbage mars the woods, but here too there are canopies of soaring trees and a luxuriously unhurried slug. The deeper the men walk into the forest, accompanied only by Mark’s dog, the more they recede into the surrounding green, until they become part of the larger picture, not its centerpiece.  There is a universal aspect to this story about memory and loss, and how we use the past to take refuge from the present. You can’t go home again; sometimes, you can’t even share a bowl of pot the way you once did. Yet if Mark and Kurt’s excursion resembles any number of classic adventures across time and space, the film is also insistently about this specific moment in time and space. Namely, an America in which progressive radio (actually, snippets from Air America) delivers the relentless grind of bad news that Mark can only listen to without comment and with a face locked in worry, a face on which Ms. Reichardt invites us to project the shell shock, despair and hopelessness of everyone else listening in across the country.  At one point during their travels, Kurt tells Mark a meandering story that begins with a trip to a store to buy a notebook and ends with a scene from a dream. In his dream a woman gives Kurt a hug and tells him that “sorrow is nothing but worn-out joy.” It’s a sentiment  befitting  Wordsworth, whose description of  poetry as “the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings: it takes its origin from emotion recollected in tranquillity” finds perfect cinematic expression in a stunningly moving close-up of Mark’s open, surprised and now-joyful face as he listens to Kurt. It’s uncertain how much of Kurt’s charming story Mark really hears, but for a few moments he seems liberated by it and the man sharing it.  All journeys come to an end, and Mark and Kurt’s brings the friends almost full circle, back to the same city street where they met up. It’s an unceremonious parting, absent any of the warmth that surfaced during their hot-spring idyll. From the way Kurt looks at Mark, it seems clear he knows there won’t be another reunion. From the way Mark automatically switches on the car radio and its drone (“the uncertainty about  the future”), it’s just as evident that only one traveler went anywhere. Joy wears out naturally for some people; others  use it up. That Ms. Reichardt chooses to end her film with an image of Kurt, out in the streets and alive to the world, suggests that he hasn’t given up on it, and neither has she.

A camping trip shared by two longtime friends provides the basis for a beautifully nuanced study in friendship and the irretrievability of the past in "Old Joy." Second feature by director Kelly Reichardt trades the humid Florida swamplands of her impressive 1994 debut, "River of Grass," for the backwoods of the Pacific Northwest, but maintains the earlier film's richly atmospheric feel for regional American landscapes and the characters that populate them. Pic's sparse dialogue, meaningful pauses and meditative pull won't be to everyone's liking, but strong festival buzz (it won a Tiger prize in Rotterdam) and critical hosannas should help garner specialized theatrical release. 
When Portland resident Mark (Daniel London) gets a call from his old buddy Kurt (musician Will Oldham) proposing a weekend retreat into the Oregon wilderness, he immediately consents, no matter the thinly veiled disapproval of Mark's pregnant wife (Tanya Smith). An unspecified amount of time has passed since the two men last saw each other: The bedraggled, unemployed Kurt has spent a transformative spell in Ashland, but now faces imminent eviction from his apartment, while Mark has become ever more burdened with domestic responsibilities. Without either of them saying anything to this end, we sense these two friends were once very much alike and now scarcely recognize each other.
Though it sounds on paper like a straight version of "Brokeback Mountain" or perhaps "Sideways" with granola substituted for wine, "Old Joy" is really a film about our inability to stop the hands of time, and about the search for sanctuary in an increasingly chaotic world. As Mark and Kurt venture into the woods, they reminisce about a former roommate who now lives in Big Sur; pass by a juice shop that used to be an independent record store; and more often than not, merely soak up the beauty of the passing landscape, which Reichardt's camera regards as though it were some final, endangered frontier.
The scenes in the woods mix comedy, confession and even -- in one remarkable sequence set at a hot springs -- subtle undertones of dread, as the men reconnect while tacitly acknowledging they will likely never see each other again.
Throughout, Reichardt (who also co-wrote the script with Jonathan Raymond, adapting the latter's equally minimalist short story) makes big demands of her actors, forcing them to find other ways of communicating their characters' personalities than through dialogue. London offers a nicely understated take on a one-time rebel whose stopped fighting the system and become a part of it. But it's Oldham who becomes "Old Joy's" gravitational center, carving out an inimitable portrait of one of society's marginal people -- a man who we realize could well disappear into the ether without anyone realizing.
Photographed by cinematographer Peter Sillen in Super 16mm (transferred to HD video for pic's Sundance premiere), the colors in "Old Joy" are radiant: deep sky blues, fiery reds and sunburst yellows. No less striking is pic's sound design, in which everything from a vacuum cleaner whirring to a cricket chirping is rendered with uncommon crispness and clarity.

A dozen years ago, Kelly Reichardt  made her feature debut with a wonderfully desultory, nearly avant-garde riff on the last romantic couple. Reichardt's River of Grass  was a comic, slacker Bonnie and Clyde , set on the edge of the Everglades. Her belated follow-up, the more elegiac but no less site-specific Old Joy included in New Directors/New Films and opening today at Film Forumis a diminished, grunge Easy Rider .
An aging Oregon hippie, one step from sleeping on the pavement, persuades his cautiously domesticated buddy, soon to be a father, to come out and play. Mark (Daniel London ) is introduced meditating (or not) in his backyard. His very pregnant wife hovers disapprovingly in the background as he takes an unexpected call from his old friend Kurt (indie godlet Will Oldham ). Immediate unresolvable conflict: Mark wants to secure his wife's "permission" to flee from the family, albeit temporarily, with Kurt into the woods. (Or rather, the Bagby Hot Springs, near Mount Hood .)
Driving by himself beneath the magnificently overcast sky, Mark listens to Air America . Climbing into the car, Kurt dispels that particular reality principle, with his earnest babble about some "transformative" experience or a "joyful night" on Big Sur . "I'm at a whole new place now," he informs Mark as they make a quick stop to cop a dime bag of grass. Oldham is brilliantly annoying as the cow-eyed free spirit, provocatively named for the martyr of Northwest grunge. The friends are almost cartoonish types. Mark is diffident, lanky, and emotionally withholding. Kurt, who is built like a muscular toddler, has a full beard and a bald crown. At once needy and self-sufficient, he's all but confrontational in his mellowness, wreathed in marijuana smoke and a smug aura of not entirely spurious wisdom.
It's inevitable that the pair gets lost and winds up camping off the road. (The morning light will be especially unkind.) Throughout the ordeal, Mark says nothing, obviously wondering why he's there. "So are you looking forward to fatherhood?" Kurt asks. Mark's unconvincing enthusiasm spurs Kurt's mind to address more serious issues. Astrophysics, he asserts, "makes perfect sense" to him. Mark may be dubious, but Kurt plunges ahead, describing the universe as a tear falling forever through space. And then, he says what's really on his mind: "I miss you, Mark. I want us to be friends again."
It's inevitable, too, that they will finally find the entrance to the woodland spa that Kurt has selected as their destination. There's a magical shot of reflected trees in the windshield. The friends hike through the forest to a nirvana of rustic wooden tubs. Soaking in the woods, immersed in nature, Mark trances out as Kurt recounts an obscure dream that provides the movie with its title. The two spend a night in the woods and . . . nothing happens. Or maybe everything: Reichardt's evocatively low-key sense of nature seems closer to classic Japanese than current Amerindie cinema.
Old Joy is an adventure out of time. Essentially anecdotal, the movie is a mosaic of details, many rendered in close-up. (The reaction shots are particularly nuanced.) Coming in the same year as Andrew Bujalski 's similarly understated and character-driven Mutual Appreciation , it attests to a new strain in Amerindie productionliterate but not literary, crafted without ostentation, rooted in a specific place and devoted to small sensations. If Old Joy  is more laid-back and contemplative than Mutual Appreciation , it's because the characters are more weathered. Open-ended as it may appear, it has a crushing finality. For all the wool-gathering and guitar-noodling, this road movie is at least as tender as it is ironic.
