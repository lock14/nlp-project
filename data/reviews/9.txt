“9’’ is just about the only animated movie this year not to be released in 3-D. But it flaunts meticulous design and downbeat color scheme (browns, blacks, glowing toxic greens) that provoke a similar response. At least twice, my hand motioned toward the screen to touch what I saw. The wax in a stub of a candle, the grooved grains in a piece of wood that passes for a pair of hands, the bird’s skull that serves as a helmet. It’s a stupid but involuntary response, the way some art makes you want to touch the canvas. You’re tricked into believing in the tactility of what is so obviously only visual.
The movie, conceived and directed by Shane Acker, is computer-animated but moves in the lifelike jerkiness of old-fashioned stop-motion. Acker brings us another story of a world on its post-apocalyptic last leg, only this one, imaginatively enough, is populated solely by machines and a collection of nine living puppets called stitchpunks, which might put a smile on many a science fiction writer’s face.
The stitchpunks are the final vestiges of an elaborate metaphysical science experiment, and they hold the key to restoring humanity, which has been reduced to these puppets. “9’’ is set in a bombed-out city (it feels like London after a nuclear blitz), and begins with the awakening of the puppet whose name gives the movie  its title and whose voice belongs to Elijah Wood.
Nine was the last of these science experiments. His number is inked across his back, and he gradually discovers that he is not alone. He meets, among others, the efficient 2 (Martin Landau), the oafish, one-eyed 5 (John C. Reilly), the imperious, rather cowardly elder statesman, 1 (Christopher Plummer), and 3 (Jennifer Connelly), an adventuress who’s game for anything. They wear their numbers, too, and, after 2 goes missing, they band together and take on the rampaging machine  - a giant metallic arachnid  - that appears to want their souls.
The tale is spare (Acker has harvested this 79-minute film from his Oscar-nominated short), which means there’s time to marvel at the many splendid details. All the puppet and monster parts are found materials. Nine is made of burlap. He’s built like a pear. His hands are wooden, his fingers metal. Each of the dolls has a different fastener stitched onto his front: 9’s zips up (and down), 1 has metal snaps, 2 has laces, 5 has buttons. Each puppet has goggles for eyes. The centers are camera shutters, but  each has been customized to express  its owner’s personality. One’s  shutter, for instance, opens at a much slower aperture. Nothing this homemade should be this sophisticated, and yet it is.
Tim Burton is one of the producers of “9.’’ The Russian director of “Night Watch,’’ “Day Watch,’’ and last summer’s Angelina Jolie action contraption “Wanted,’’ Timur Bekmambetov, is another. That they’ve tapped Acker to join their gang is testament to the grandeur of Acker’s sunless  vision. He wrote the movie with Ben Gluck, and Pamela Pettler, who also wrote Burton’s stop-motion musical “Corpse Bride. “9’’ also recalls Terry Gilliam, Chris Marker, Jan Svankmajer, and the Quay brothers  - some contortions of “Pinocchio’’ and “The Wizard of Oz’’ too. (There’s a terrific sequence in which the surviving stitchpunks mount an LP of “Somewhere Over the Rainbow’’ on a phonograph, riding its crank up and down in short-lived bliss.)
These allusions and influences don’t get in the way of the movie’s originality, though. What I loved about “9’’ is how much evident care its makers have put into it. I suppose the folks behind “Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs’’ care just as much about craftsmanship and visual authenticity. But you also watch it fully aware that they’re OK with turning apocalypse into a Happy Meal. It’s a synthetically tidy, somewhat insincere entertainment.
Any optimism in “9,’’ which is bound to try the fortitude of meeker children, feels hard-won. It actually ends in a bittersweet mystery. The film’s finale suggests that the human race could indeed be restored. But in doing so it leaves several intriguing reproductive questions unresolved.

The end of human civilization is not healthy for children and other living things. But movies as varied as WALL·E , Children of Men , and The Road Warrior  are proof that apocalyptic catastrophe is great for moviemakers, inspiring wonderfully original visions of ruin and expanding the artistic possibilities of cinematic technology. The latest achievement in art direction with an end-of-humanity theme belongs to the CG-animated fantasy-adventure 9 , a tale of trust, bravery, and cooperation among a scrap-heap tribe of survivors, set in a desolate near-future where an overarching artificial intelligence known as the Great Machine has turned human-built contraptions into oppressors.
With no small debt to the nameless residents of the Village in the great 1960s TV series The Prisoner , the hero of 9   named for the number on his back  is himself a nameless individual. And like the others in his tattered crew, he’s a mutant: Some time before mean machines ran amok and all but obliterated humanity, the flesh-and-blood tinkerer who invented 9 and his cohorts out of junk, household hodgepodge, and burlap (lots of burlap) managed to sneak a little bit of old-fashioned, carbon-based soul into each. Our protagonist, for instance, displays qualities of compassion and leadership, and is voiced by Elijah Wood to prove it. The crusty naysayer known as 1 (Christopher Plummer) is a proud old war veteran who’s also prone to cowardly pessimism when push comes to machine-driven shove. The dude called 5 (John C. Reilly) is as loyal a sidekick as you’d expect in a Reilly-voiced one-eyed doll made of buttons and cloth. Wearing terrific bird-beaked headgear and modeling her moves on Angelina Jolie kicking butt in Wanted , 7 (Jennifer Connelly) is a fearless, feminist dream of a wonder woman. The mystically inclined artist numbered 6 (Crispin Glover), meanwhile, wields pen-nib fingers with a skill he might have learned from Edward Scissorhands .
Those homages to Wanted  and Scissorhands  are no accident, by the way. First-time feature director Shane Acker developed 9  (not to be confused with District 9 , Nine , or Cloud 9 , a recent indie about old German people having sex) from his stunning, much bleaker, wordless, 11-minute film of the same name. Acker’s short  which served as his 2004 UCLA student thesis and starred only 9, 5, and a relentless machine  floated around the film-festival circuit in 2005, rightfully scooping up an Oscar nomination. It also acquired influential support from heavyweights like Tim Burton and Wanted’s Timur Bekmambetov, who served as godfatherly producers the way Peter Jackson backed District 9  director Neill Blomkamp.
The expanded cast of creatures looks great, dressed and animated in the homespun style Acker calls ''stitchpunk.'' (Fans of Acker’s original film devised the term ''steampunk'' tp describe the machine-y nuts-and-bolts-and-scrap-metal aesthetic that defines the movie’s look and the characters' environment.) 9 and his gang negotiate their dust-colored, junkstrewn, wrecked world with unceasing ingenuity, repeatedly extricating themselves from dangers involving stomping, clanging, weapon-hurling contraptions. The violence, while not bloody, is diabolically inventive, and may burst the zippers of littler kids in the audience; one of the creepiest technobeasts is a doll-headed ''seamstress'' that mechanically sews a victim up within itself.
In fact, the numbered creatures and their dead-eyed pursuers are so engaging, and Acker’s visual style so delightfully, obsessively devoted both to close detail and broad scope, that the movie rattles on for quite a while before the more sci-fi-minded viewer realizes that the story is ultimately ethereally thin, and conventionally upbeat. Storyboarded with precision, and enhanced with a resonant score by Deborah Lurie, Acker’s handsome, feature-length 9  is, for all its visual flights of fancy, grounded in an apocalypse-proof message graspable by any schoolchild: When machines (or other bullies) rise up, a vulnerable population can find strength in cooperation. We should all share our resources to fight back against oppressors, trust girls to have really good ideas, and repurpose household items whenever possible.


 9, who is about the size and shape of one of those posable tabletop mannequins used by art students, has a soft burlap body and a zipper up his middle. His outsize eyes blink like camera shutters, and they take in a world of monstrous terror and haunting mystery.  In the 10-minute version of the animated film that bears his name, 9 and his comrades — who I suppose should be called robots, though they are softer and rounder than the contraptions usually evoked by that word — navigate their surroundings without speech. Now, at feature length, the main character’s muteness is a temporary impediment, and he finds himself surrounded by eight other numbered automatons,  introduced out of order like a row of Sudoku. (The numerologically inclined will note that the film’s opening date is 9/9/09). Some of these figures speak in the polished tones of well-known actors, including John C. Reilly, Jennifer Connelly and Crispin Glover.  Once 2 (Martin Landau) gives him a tuneup, 9 begins asking questions in the voice of Elijah Wood. And one of the virtues of this “9,” as of its shorter predecessor (both were directed by Shane Acker, who wrote the feature with Pamela Pettler) is that it does not rush toward answers. Instead it lingers in a strange, sinister and brilliantly realized landscape rich with allusions to the histories of painting, animation, fantastic literature and 20th-century totalitarianism.  It’s a lot to stuff into 88 minutes, along with rattling monsters, hectic battle sequences and a series of debates between 9 and 1 (Christopher Plummer) about the proper response to danger. (1 wants to remain safe, hidden and ignorant, while 9 wants to fight, explore and learn. You can guess who prevails). But even though it grows a little busy at times and concludes with an unfortunate and unconvincing foray into mystico-spiritual mumbo jumbo, “9” shows remarkable imagination and visual integrity.  Combining two well-worn, endlessly fertile science fiction conceits — the postapocalyptic planet and the sensitive machine — Mr. Acker has made a parable of technological peril that is both exciting and satisfyingly enigmatic. Though he uses the latest computer-assisted techniques, his aesthetic has a pleasingly creaky, handmade feel, as if his main tools were not a mouse and a keyboard but rather a needle and thread.  The evil machines ranged against the soft-bodied robots resemble collaborations between Rube Goldberg and Hieronymus Bosch. They are demonic things with glowing eyes and ferocious appetites. The motive for their murderous zeal is one of the puzzles that 9, in the midst of struggling for survival, must try to solve.  This movie’s affinity with “Wall-E,” another fable of a soulful machine in a blighted, depopulated milieu, is clear enough, though “9” never achieves that film’s lyrical sublimity. Some of Mr. Acker’s influences are easy to spot, from experimental animators like Jan Svankmajer and the Brothers Quay to Tim Burton, a producer of “9.” Its look is smoky, dusty and vaguely European, and its gadgets have an analog solidity that suggests the futuristic nightmares of a long-ago time.  9 and his brethren, scuttling through bombed-out buildings like partisans in an occupied city, evading predatory bird- and spiderlike  foes and quarreling among themselves, also try to piece together their own history. Their inquiry is both metaphysical — who made them, and why? — and practical: what are they made of, and how does it work? Answers are parceled out in quieter moments and in vivid rushes of imagery that punctuate the fights and flights.  The action is breathless and intense, the ravenous villains are frightening to behold, and the overall mood is probably too dark and anxious for very young children. But every effort to expand the range of feature-length animation beyond the confines of cautious family fare is to be welcomed, and budding techno and fantasy geeks are likely to be intrigued and enthralled.  “9” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some scary scenes of danger and destruction.

Mother Earth laid waste by a future apocalypse is envisioned once again onscreen in the quirkily creative "9." Expanding his 11-minute 2005 Academy Award-nominated short of the same name, Shane Acker has used the support of producers Tim Burton and Timur Bekmambetov to recruit big-name voice talent and elaborate his story of pint-sized humanoids charged with perpetuating "life" on the planet. Design aspects are arresting and the filmmaker's abilities are obvious, but the basic survival story remains slight, just as the general setting, no matter how artfully imagined, is by now pretty familiar. These factors, coupled with very brief running time (picture proper, sans credits, lasts 72 minutes), suggest good returns by specialized release standards for this Focus Features toon rather than more grandiose potential.
Acker's UCLA-made short pictured the same bombed-out, desolate urban landscape, one in which the eponymous little creature, a doll-like figure with a body of zipped-up fabric and blinking lenses for eyes, played hide-and-seek with a predatory mechanical monster until tricking it into its demise. Both are back for more cat-and-mouse this time, and are joined in the fleshed-out screenplay of Pamela Pettler ("Tim Burton's Corpse Bride," "Monster House") by Nos. 1-8, forerunners of No. 9 and all created by a genius human scientist as hoped-for seeds of intelligent life in the wake of a cataclysmic war.
Unlike before, the numbered colleagues can now talk, and talk they do as they congregate and strategize over how best to cope with the monster -- and then, more dauntingly, with an enormous beast with so many moving metal parts that it's impossible to get a full picture of its true shape.
It's a very simple story, one distinguished by the unusual nature of its protagonists (although they share the same manufactured "species," each has its own distinctive look, personality and identifying number printed on its back), the often elevated tone of their discourse and the ever-intriguing detail of the landscape. Looking like decimated post-WWII Europe but most strongly evoking a ruined London, with its emphasis on Victorian-era, post-industrial revolution ironwork that characterizes the Steampunk style, the film summons up images of scientific imagination and worldly devastation close to those found in Jules Verne and H.G. Wells, as well as in films as recent as "I Am Legend" and "Wall-E," in which protags similarly navigated cities emptied of their prior flesh-and-blood inhabitants.
Among those scurrying through the scrapheaps of a dead civilization, a waste pile left when the ultra-powerful machines turned against their makers, are No. 1 (voiced by Christopher Plummer), a reedy, almost priest-like figurehead given to unilateral pronouncements and negative assessments; supportive, one-eyed No. 5 (John C. Reilly); strong-minded female No. 7 (Jennifer Connelly); pen-fingered artist No. 6 (Crispin Glover); Michelin Man-proportioned strongman No. 8 (Fred Tatasciore); mute twins No. 3 and No. 4, and elderly No. 2 (Martin Landau), whose disappearance leads to a daring rescue mission to the distant three chimneys looming on the gloomy horizon.
But it falls to No. 9 (Elijah Wood), the youngest and most evolved of the group, to provide the resourcefulness and leadership necessary to give them a chance against the deadly beast, a clanging giant spider of a thing that relentlessly stalks its prey and, once it has a victim in its grip, destroys its "soul" by means of a devastating electromagnetic force. No. 9 discovers the means to counteract this lightning-like charge, but implementing it is another matter altogether.
Found footage and other excavated artifacts provide pointed backstory about a dictator under whose regime the world went bonkers, as well as info about how the scientist poured aspects of his own human personality into each of his numbered "children." The film provides creepy, even haunting moments, especially the sight of the beast's penetrating red eye emerging out of a dusty cloud, and while it's probably too serious and intense for smaller children, sci-fi-keen viewers from 10 or so upward shouldn't develop lasting mental problems from it, the PG-13 rating notwithstanding.
In the end, the picture's impact derives mostly from its design and assured execution. Visuals are drenched in a dusky amber, through which other, more vibrant hues shimmer from time to time, and odd vibrations flutter out that provoke memories of other films, architectural and art-world creations, and slices of history, actual and imagined. Acker's work seems poised on the edge between commercial considerations and genuinely eccentric creativity, and the best things in "9" inspire the hope that he will more extensively explore the latter before capitulating entirely to the former.

Early in Shane Acker 's computer-animated debut feature 9 , a diminutive anthropomorphic whatsit with wooden hands, copper fingers, and the titular numeral emblazoned on his chest awakens to the lifeless body of his human creator and sets forth into a decimated industrial landscape—all twisted metal and smokestacks—that calls to mind London after the Blitz.
Like a post-apocalyptic Pinocchio, #9 (voiced by Elijah Wood ) encounters some like-minded (and similar-looking) fellow travelers, each duly numbered, 1 through 8, in the order they were created. The Dr. Pangloss-y #1 (Christopher Plummer ) is the self-appointed leader, suspicious of outsiders and potential threats to his authority; #2 (Martin Landau ) is the kindly inventor who welcomes #9 into the fold; #5 (John C. Reilly ) is a loyal, selfless lieutenant; #7 (Jennifer Connelly ) is the token she-whatsit; and so on. For good measure, there's even a raving fanatic, #6 (who else but Crispin Glover ?), given to manic, ink-blot drawings, and a cleaver-wielding goombah, #8, who, for reasons never fully explained, looms as large as, well, 2 times 4.
Probably the strangest animated feature to appear since Coraline , albeit far less varied in mood and style, 9  was expanded by Acker (with screenwriter Pamela Pettler ) from his 2004 Oscar-nominated short film of the same name. Tim Burton  came on board as a producer (along with Night Watch  and Wanted  director Timur Bekmambetov ), and there is an obvious touch of Burtonia to the movie's dystopian vision, with nods in the direction of Czech animator Jan vankmajer and the late Polish painter/photographer Zdzisaw Beksinski as well. The result is never as gripping in narrative terms—a well-worn litany of dystopian-future chestnuts—as it is visually, but Acker keeps things moving briskly for the movie's 70-odd minutes, and pulls off the trickier feat of establishing distinct personalities for his monochromatic, look-alike characters, who ultimately have more in common with the functional men of war in a '50s B-movie than with the plush-toy-ready denizens of most American animated fare.
Long before "Over the Rainbow" finds its way onto the soundtrack, we know we're not in Kansas anymore. Mankind, it seems, has gone the way of the dodo, wiped out in a Terminator -style war of hyper-intelligent machines. (Newsreel flashbacks suggest a fascistic regime that exalted metal over flesh.) The machines themselves are still around, busy making other machines in their own image—a cavalcade of gruesome droids with glowing red nerve centers and flailing metallic tentacles that could have crawled out of H.R. Giger 's erector set. One of them, known only as the Beast, ferries #2 off to certain doom, setting the movie's things-on-a-mission plot into motion; another, arguably Acker's pièce de résistance, is a horrid, scissor-handed serpent with a doll's face and a belly into which it sews its victims.
Although valiant #9 and his modified marionette brethren are the ostensible heroes of Acker's tale, the director himself seems secretly to be siding with his ever-more-nightmarishly-detailed, freakazoidal contraptions, who could wipe the floor with WALL-E's showtune-loving carcass. Collectively, they give 9  the feeling of a perversely fascinating ballet mécanique —a movie that literally expends with humans in the way that Hollywood  blockbusters have been figuratively doing for years.
