Based on a novel by Francine Rivers, The Last Sin Eater
 takes place among a community of Welsh immigrants living in the American Appalachians during the 1850s. Old World customs and superstitions still govern their rural lives, and sometimes (big surprise) these rituals are used to shroud secrets of the past. After her grandmother dies, 10-year-old Cadi (Liberato) first learns of the sin eater, a solitary man banished from the community who creeps out to imbibe the dead person�s sins, thereby absolving the sinner by taking them all unto himself. Feeling responsible for the death of her younger sister, an incident that has thrown her family into emotional turmoil, Cadi wants to find the sin eater so he can work his absolution magic on her. But once he does, she discovers she feels no better. (This girl�s so guilty it�s enough to make you suspect she�s really Jewish.) But then she and Fagan (Fulton), the platonic boy pal whom she plays with when she�s not traipsing through the woods with her ethereal spirit friend, Lilybet (Rose), stumble across a character billed only as Man of God (Thomas), who tells them all about Jesus Christ � the original
 sin eater. So there you have the film�s driving objective: supplanting the traditions of proto-hillbillies with the redeeming words of Jesus. Speaking of words, it�s impossible to accept as authentic the Welsh accents spoken in this Utah-filmed parable. Each character seems to be speaking a uniquely concocted dialect. Until I looked at the printed credits, my ears were unable to decipher whether the young heroine�s name was Cadi, Callie, or Carrie. (My favorite self-styled colloquialism is Cadi�s pronunciation of sin eater as a three-syllabled word that places the accent on the middle syllable: sin-�e-ter.) You�ll forgive the film if it looks a little bit like Little House on the Prairie
: It�s directed by Michael Landon Jr., and all those pinafores and log cabins must be in his blood. However, the look of The Last Sin Eater
 is muddy and indiscriminately focused. The camera always seems to be too far off when you wish to get a better look and too close when you wish that it would point at anything other than what�s in the frame. Films that promote a Christian ethos and impart relevant narratives that go beyond the classic Bible-story mold are becoming more numerous and available through mainstream exhibition modes. Whether their goal is to nourish the faithful or lure the heathens is not always clear. The only thing that�s clear is that The Last Sin Eater
 serves neither of these higher purposes.


Multitudes of readers have embraced "The Last Sin Eater," Christian novelist Francine Rivers' allegorical tale of forgiveness and redemption in 1850s Appalachia. Still, the question remains: Will they gather at the megaplexes for Michael Landon Jr.'s respectfully sincere but only fitfully involving filmization? Despite the usual grassroots campaigning customarily used to launch such faith-based product, it's more likely that most members of the target aud will wait for the sweet by-and-by -- and catch the pic on homevid.
Set in a small 19th-century Appalachian community founded by Welsh immigrants, pic pivots on the extraordinary efforts by 10-year-old Cadi Forbes (Liana Liberato) to absolve the guilt she feels for indirectly -- and altogether accidentally -- causing the death of her younger sister.
Years earlier, the local elders re-established an ancient Celtic ritual by designating one of their group as a Sin Eater -- a sort of sanctifying scapegoat who eats and drinks at the graveside of the newly deceased, thereby cleansing each dead person's soul by assuming blame for his or her worldly transgressions. When he's not munching on misdeeds, the Sin Eater (Peter Wingfield) remains a solitary recluse, forced to live apart from the community that shuns him (except, of course, on those occasions when his services are required).
Cadi get the bright idea that maybe, just maybe, she can track down the Sin Eater and have herself cleansed while she's still alive. But the youngster can't get a real shot at redemption without the intercession of a sprightly stranger (Thea Rose) who may or not be an angel, and the inspiration of an itinerant preacher (Henry Thomas) who suffers dearly for his faith.
Ultimately, Cadi discovers that there is only one true Sin Eater (i.e., Jesus Christ) just in time to encourage elderly Miz Elda (Louise Fletcher) to reveal a dark secret about truly sinful actions by the community's founders.
Never afraid to overstate the obvious, helmer and co-scripter Landon establishes, underscores and italicizes each plot point with the well-intentioned didacticism of a Sunday School teacher. (Even so, a couple of violent scenes may make the pic unsuitable for very small children.) As secular drama, however, "The Last Sin Eater" is too leisurely paced to be anything more than a modestly diverting time-killer. It doesn't help that a subplot involving Native Americans is introduced far too late in the story, without any foreshadowing whatsoever, to have the impact Landon clearly intends.
The actors and their accents are inconsistent, but never so off-target as to be genuinely annoying. Fletcher brings effective gravitas to her relatively small part, while newcomer Liberato capably handles the many demands of her lead role.
Pic was attractively lensed by Robert Seaman in Utah locales that adequately double for Appalachian mountain country.

Louise Fletcher as Nurse Ratched in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is arguably the most iconic female villain in film history. The miscasting of Fletcherstill a forbidding screen presenceas a kindly grandmother is only one of many missteps that director Michael Landon Jr.  (yes, it's his son) makes in The Last Sin Eater, the tale of a guilt-wracked 10-year-old in mid-19th-century Appalachia . Little Cadi (Liana Liberato ) is convinced that she caused the death of her younger sister and obsessed with absolving her crime by finding the "sin eater"a member of the community who allegedly grants redemption to the worldly. Liberato muddles through a heavy-handed Christian agenda and barely legible plot as the film follows Cadi through the woods on various sin-expunging missions, sometimes accompanied by an imaginary sprite or her pseudo-love-interest Fagan. Toward the end of the film, Cadi and Fagan stumble on a "Man of God," who teaches them, and the rest of the village, that there are no mortal sin eaters: Only Jesus can nosh on your transgressions.
