Hail the U.S.-Mexico border film that uses its setting to explore issues other than the porousness of personal and cultural identity. Not Forgotten
 is a border-town thriller, which premiered at this year�s Slamdance Film Festival and is opening in Austin several weeks in advance of its national release date. With co-star Baker currently in the spotlight due to the success of his TV show The Mentalist
, the timing is auspicious for Not Forgotten
. Baker is cast as the film�s soccer dad, Jack Bishop, a banker in Del Rio, Texas (although most of the film was shot in New Mexico). His daughter, Toby (Moretz), is on the verge of adolescence, and he�s married to Amaya (Vega), his second wife and Toby�s loving stepmother. They appear to be a perfectly happy and ordinary integrated family, but then Toby (who narrates the story in voiceover) is kidnapped from her soccer practice, and the veneer of the perfect family is scraped raw in the process of solving the kidnapping mystery. Integral to the story is the religious cult of Santa Muerte, a death cult we�re told is popular with drug dealers and prostitutes. Santa Muerte is a real practice, rejected by the Catholic Church but flourishing among criminals and victims of violence and poverty. Also containing themes of vengeance, the faith and its artifacts play a central and colorful role in Not Forgotten
. The plot is a tightly wound mystery that gradually reveals itself, saving most of its surprises for third-act revelations. What starts out as an ordinary police investigation into a kidnapping grows ever lurid once a couple of FBI agents (Watanabe and Rolston) enter the scene and Jack goes on a renegade solo mission across the border. Without giving away the film�s plot twists, however, I don�t think Not Forgotten
 holds up to psychological scrutiny. There are so many hidden agendas at work here that it�s hard to believe these conflicts would not have come into play prior to Toby�s kidnapping. The film moves swiftly and vividly, but in retrospect, numerous plot holes come to mind. Not Forgotten
 presents a fascinating microcosm but ultimately loses believability when placed in a larger context.

 February 2008: Simon Baker shoots “Not Forgotten.” March 2008: Simon Baker is cast in a new television series called “The Mentalist.” September 2009: “Not Forgotten,” a lurid yet plodding thriller, bobs to the surface in theaters, most likely to the chagrin of the now very hot Simon Baker.  Mr. Baker and Paz Vega star as Jack and Amaya, an inordinately attractive couple living in a town near the Mexico border that is part Mayberry, part freak show. The abduction of their daughter (played by Chloe Moretz) sets in motion a plot full of twists that can be seen coming from some distance; the fact that the kidnapped girl is also the narrator doesn’t increase the suspense.  Eventually Jack heads south of the border to battle mobsters, Mexican folk religion and his own wildly improbable secret past. Mr. Baker works hard, but he doesn’t do back-streets avenger as well as he does smug playboy.  Dror Soref, director and co-writer (with Tomás Romero) of this mishmash of “Touch of Evil” and “Angel Heart,” gooses the atmosphere with strobe-like montages of violence and lingers on the faces of strange-looking passersby. Early on the 11-year-old narrator says, “One day I just stopped caring.” You will, too.  “Not Forgotten” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Semi- nude strippers and prostitutes; violence to people and chickens.

Despite teasing hints of supernatural influences throughout much of the storyline, "Not Forgotten" satisfies as a solidly crafted and persuasively acted thriller that relies more on dark secrets than black magic. Given Simon Baker's newly re-elevated profile thanks to the hit CBS series "The Mentalist," this indie effort should provide sufficient marquee allure to ensure it reaches receptive auds in homevid and cable venues. 
Baker brings appropriate shadings of intensity to his portrayal of Jack Bishop, a successful businessman in a Tex-Mex border city who's driven to extremes after Toby (Chloe Moretz), his beloved 11-year-old daughter, disappears during soccer practice and is presumed kidnapped. Amaya (Paz Vega) -- Jack's wife, Toby's stepmother -- urges Jack to seek guidance from an aged "witch" of the notorious Santa Muerte cult. But Jack keeps his own council while following a trail through the mean streets of Acuna, Mexico, gradually revealing he's not quite the Mr. Nice Guy he initially appears. Helmer and co-scripter Dror Soref adroitly doles out bits and pieces of Jack's violent past to ratchet up suspense while only occasionally straining credibility with dubious plot twists. Tech values are pro.

A thriller that wants to be taken seriously probably shouldn't feature Borat 's hairy, rotund comic, Ken Davitian , in the role of a somber Catholic priest, but that's just one of the problems affecting director Dror Soref 's off-kilter Not  Forgotten.  Mild-mannered banker Jack (Simon Baker ) lives in a Texas border town with his new wife, Amaya (Paz Vega ), and his daughter, Toby (Chloe Moretz ), who clings possessively to the memory of her dead mother. When Toby goes missing during soccer practice, Jack suspects she has been abducted, possibly as part of an elaborate payback for something he did in his Mysterious Past. Not Forgotten  overcooks just about every ingredient in its narrative chile con queso, from the occasional flash-cut editing to that most desperate of dramatic devices: juxtaposing a quietly intense dialogue scene with the sound of a shrieking kettle boiling on the stove. But if the film's first two-thirds are dreary and preposterous, give Soref credit for a truly—what's the proper cinematic terminology?—batshit-crazy finale, which involves demented religious sects, ridiculously bloody face-offs, and a gaggle of cross-dressing Mexican prostitutes. As with everything else in Not Forgotten , it's impossible to call the closing stretches accomplished, but at least their feverish urgency elevates the material into the realm of the truly whacked-out, which is always preferable to dull incompetence.
