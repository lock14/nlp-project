Before this week, if you wanted to catch something akin to the true essence of the Man in Black on the big screen, you�d have had to track down a copy of the all-but-forgotten 1961 drive-in also-ran Door to Door Maniac
. This Desperate Hours
 retread from American International Pictures starred Johnny Cash as a funereal thug who takes tyke Ronnie Howard and his mother hostage in the wake of a bank heist gone southbound. Cash whiles away what few hours he has left crooning gravedigger schmaltz like "Five Minutes to Death" and the creepy "I�ve Come to Kill You" to the poor bank president�s wife. Actress Cay Forrester churned out the mortally wounded script for this stumblebum noir, so she had it coming, but Cash acquits himself admirably as the sort of lowlife bad enough to bleach the fun clean out of good old American manslaughter. It�s the eyes, you see. The way they shine and roll all wrong under those drooping, cold-blooded lids is method acting straight from the original amphetamine reptile. Dope, guns, and fucking in the streets? Both real and reel Cash lived for all three and survived often enough to become a legend not once but twice. He circumvented the rowdy mantrap of diminishing rock & roll returns (which muffled virtually all of Sam Phillips� six-string cocksmen in the end) by giving up his one true love � little white speed pills � for his other one true love � young Memphis country and gospel sasspot June Carter (Witherspoon), a powder keg of padlocked passions whose sparks ignited for her music, friends, family, and also, to her dismay, this black-clad baritone with the quiver in his voice and the arrow in his heart. Joaquin Phoenix as Cash in Walk the Line
 is the next best thing to having been there, I suppose, and although the sinner man�s early successes and echoing woes look chaotically entertaining indeed in that hellishly dashing sort of way young doomsters can exude, the wreckage he leaves in his wake is quick and obvious and banal. Only the steady output of his lonely locomotive guitar and plaintive, almost homely, voice made this bad Cash worth anybody�s jukebox dime. As the son of an Arkansas sharecropper (Patrick), who blames young J.R. for the horrific accidental death by bandsaw of his beloved older brother (and preacher-to-be), Cash�s only friends were the radio, gospel music, and his mother (singer Lynne). At 18 he saw his chance and left behind the cotton flatlands for a stint in the Air Force before returning to marry first wife Vivian (Goodwin), sire three daughters, and, by the skin of his teeth and the grace of Sun Records, cut a record and get it on the radio. It�s here, especially, that Phoenix becomes the tour-ravaged, fan-struck (and -fucked) road rat, who only comes into his own after damning his own familial good fortune by tumbling for the ever-hesitant June like a pair of the most loaded dice in the devil�s pocket And that�s it, really: Cash, Carter, and the Benzedrine and Dexedrine 12-step. Mangold, working from a fine, tightly wound script by himself and Gill Dennis, begins and ends things at Folsom Prison, immersed in the roar and the stink of caged men unchained by Cash�s genuine rebel yell (or drawl). Mangold, Phoenix, and Witherspoon, all excellent in their roles, are in on the secret: Folsom Prison was as likely as sky to be Johnny Cash�s real, final homestead. Things just got a little mixed up on the way to hell. And thank God for that.


"Walk the Line" becomes more than a standard Hollywood biopic the instant Joaquin Phoenix's Johnny Cash loses his breath watching June Carter wow a packed auditorium.
Who can blame him? Reese Witherspoon plays Carter, and it's a pretty amazing movie-star moment.
The crowd that's come to see Carter is familiar with her chirpy twang and crack comic timing, just as we're familiar with Witherspoon's chirpy twang and crack comic timing. It's Cash who's never seen this woman sing before, and as Phoenix begins his slow, smitten descent, so, too, do we. It's like falling in love with Witherspoon again for the first time.
"Walk the Line" retells the first half of Cash's life according to the biopic arc. The film starts with his unhappy childhood on an Arkansas farm with a mean dad, traces his noncombat military stint in the Air Force, his rise to country music fame, and his addiction to amphetamines.
But James Mangold's film is more shrewdly conceived than that. For one thing, he has the cast sing in their own voices, which gives the movie invaluable authenticity. The screenplay has the ups and downs of a country ballad. Carter rescued Cash from his demons, a fact Cash, who died two years ago, happily admitted. But, as a classic love story requires, there were obstacles, most of which were put up by Carter.
A popular singer and songwriter, she was a true professional who didn't want Cash's nonstop yearning getting in the way of their singing and touring together. After all, he was married, and she was a divorced parent and an American sweetheart, mindful of the moral rigors of the 1950s era. Her good-girl demeanor complemented and conflicted with Cash's hard living and anti-authoritarianism.
Mangold adapted "Walk the Line" from Cash's autobiography, and he retains many of Cash's personal lows (the childhood death of his brother and that disapproving father, played by Robert Patrick) and career highs (too many to count), bookending the film with the classic 1968 Folsom Prison concert.
After returning from the service, Cash marries Vivian Liberto (Ginnifer Goodwin), whom he'd known for only a month, and settles down in Memphis, where he proves a bust as a door-to-door salesman. Fatefully, he wanders into Sam Phillips's Sun Records studio, where someone named Elvis Presley is swiveling.
This all happens rather fast. Soon Cash and what was then called the Tennessee Two have a hit single, and, at a live gig, he meets Carter, whom he'd read about in magazines and listened to on the radio. Before she hits the stage, Carter, in a hoop skirt and a cardigan pink as grapefruit meat, finds herself caught in Cash's guitar strap, and their introduction is something out of one of those old Hollywood backstage musicals, where the lovers spend the picture being cute for audiences but drive each other bananas when the footlights are off. Cash was more than in love with Carter. He was desperate for her. The Man in Black was nothing without the woman in canary and carnation and lime.
Mangold, who co-wrote the movie with Gill Dennis, has devised a brilliant way of refashioning the lore of Cash's life. Not only does it focus the story, it elevates the emotional stakes for the actors. Cash spends most of the film trying to seduce this woman into surrender, first sexually, then romantically, then conjugally. So both actors are acting toward a goal: union. Even if you know that when Carter died in May 2003 (four months before Cash) she'd long since taken Cash's name, "Walk the Line" creates considerable tension about whether Cash's woo will stick.
The performances transcend mere impersonation, in part because the physical demands to play Cash and especially Carter aren't as strenuous as those to play, say, Mahatma Gandhi, Ray Charles, or Truman Capote, although Cash's convulsive, grave-digging guitar-playing style is sui generis. Neither actor is a ringer for either part. But the spirit guiding them is true, and the lack of obvious resemblance is freeing.
Witherspoon's Carter comes on like a creation from the funny pages, but the girlishness is an act. As the movie goes on her character deepens. Witherspoon, who's almost 30, can seem hopelessly jubilant in movies. And some might find her less convincing as Carter, who was quite womanly; you can't entirely hear in Witherspoon's singing the sad experience that Carter brought to her songs. Still, the image of the actress alone on a stage, strumming an autoharp and singing "Wildwood Flower" is one that belongs in a locket.
Phoenix's Cash is psychologically urgent: He needs this woman to save his life. As a performer, Phoenix often has a scary intensity. He seems ferociously committed, even to goofball parts such as his role as Mel Gibson's brother in "Signs." As Cash, Phoenix is operating at full tilt. The moment he drops his voice in "Folsom Prison Blues" to bellow the words "San Antone" during his audition for Phillips is chilling and transformative: You buy the performance and never look back. Phoenix seems to be scraping his soul to play this man and sing these songs.
The film sends you home moved and in a tuneful mood. The highest compliment you can pay a movie like "Walk the Line" is one you'd pay to any great romance. Watching these two work their way toward marriage feels like a two-hour honeymoon.


         Based on Johnny Cash's books "Man in Black" and "Cash: The Autobiography," and developed over a period of seven years with the help of Cash and June Carter Cash, James Mangold's "Walk the Line" toes it pretty well. Named for one of Cash's biggest hits, it also describes the linear progression of the story, which moves briskly from milestone to milestone, pausing along the way to photograph the monumental moments in the life of the artist, and more or less making a moral beeline for redemption.
 
  Johnny Cash's work requires no explanation or justification, but pop icon biopics do. So we get the artistic creation myth as moral allegory: a wayward soul saved by the true love of a good woman.
 


         






    From hardscrabble beginnings and early trauma to sudden fame, infidelity, addiction and romantic salvation, the movie is less an uncharted journey than a 2 p.m. bus tour of a music industry legend. But like an expert guide, Mangold shepherds the story with enough grace, energy and skill to make it worthwhile.
 
  Like most examples of the genre, "Walk the Line" is an actors' movie — the kind that requires chimeric transformations and the acquisition of new, impressive skills. Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon do first-rate work — they sing, they twang, they play new-to-them instruments, they crackle with wit and charisma, and they give off so much sexual heat it's a wonder they don't burst into flames. Theirs are the kinds of performances the Academy Awards live to reward, comprising as they do a sort of acting decathlon. But the best thing about Phoenix and Witherspoon is their emotional connection, which carries the movie and transcends the material.
 
  Dark and brooding, with a scar like a badge and eyes that seem to gradate from light to onyx as the situation requires, Phoenix fills the screen with a profound, enveloping darkness that beckons like a black sea. Handling his guitar with a force that's both sexual and violent, he suggests an inner tension the script demurs from drawing out too far, presumably for fear of making its hero unlikable. Instead it places much of the burden of negativity on Cash's father, Ray (Robert Patrick), and his first wife, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), who appear mainly to provide Cash with polar axes of disapproval. It seems pointless to plead a special case for Cash, though, who is already beloved by millions. But the movie dredges up the darker moments and so feels compelled to redress them.
 
  From the start, we learn that Cash's love for June Carter, member of the legendary Carter family, predated his love for his first wife by at least a decade. Cash listened to June on the radio as a little boy, at least until his father invariably made him turn the damn thing off. If his father was hard on him then, he withdrew his affection for good after the death of his older son, Jack, an accident he blamed on Cash, then called J.R.
 
  A quick jaunt through the early years reveals some interesting tidbits: Cash nursed his fan's crush on June while in the Air Force, reading music magazines. His interest in Folsom Prison, and his writing of "Folsom Prison Blues," was sparked by a movie he saw while he was in the service. Cash picked up his first guitar while stationed in Germany, and before his tour of duty was up, he'd written one of his most iconic songs. (Movies about artists tend to liken the process of artistic creation to a sort of calm puttering around in the kitchen, and the lyrics flow from Cash in an uninterrupted line.)
 
  Marrying Vivian upon his return from the Air Force, he moved to Memphis and began an unsuccessful career as a door-to-door salesman, while singing gospel tunes in his free time with his makeshift band, the Tennessee Two. A chance encounter with Sam Phillips (the eerily excellent Dallas Roberts) led to a recording contract and wild tours through the South along with other Sun Records prodigies Elvis (Tyler Hilton), Jerry Lee Lewis (Waylon Malloy Payne), Roy Orbison (Johnathan Rice) and Carter.
 
  In one of the funniest scenes, Cash is inducted in the ways of junkiedom by a tour-mate, who hits him with the mother of all pressure tactics: "Elvis takes them." From there, Phoenix spends much of the film bathed in sweat, jonesing, in more or less equal measure, for his pills and Carter, as his star rises and his marriage disintegrates.
 
  Carter, wisely, mostly resists, and Witherspoon, in one of her best performances, beautifully captures the tension within her. Warm, vivacious and unfailingly funny on stage, she struggles to create a stable professional and emotional life in an environment that's anything but. In a road scene with the Sun Records gang, Jerry Lee Lewis rants about how they are all going to hell for the music they sing — except for June, who's beautiful. Unlike Cash and the rest, Carter grew up famous and puts a higher premium than they do on whatever semblance of normality she can eke out from her life. The most vivid difference between Cash and Carter is her clear ability to separate her private self from her public self. In one scene, she handles an acid saleslady who objects to her divorce in a purely professional way. "I'm sorry I let you down," she says politely, containing her anger at the woman's intrusion into her personal life.
 
  It's a great early moment in the life of a celebrity as sacrificial lamb. "Walk the Line," after all, is also a portrait of the '50s and '60s, and there's something heartening about the merry band of quasi-Messianic figures loaded into a little car, spreading the word and dying (or nearly) for their sins so we won't have to.

 In general release   

For a long time, the Hollywood biopic was a corny, synthetic, quasi-reputable genre. Recently, though, warts-and-all movies like Ray  and Kinsey  and Capote , which have had the daring to show how their subjects' human failings were integral to their greatness, have raised the bar for biopics  for their authenticity and dramatic power. Walk the Line , starring Joaquin Phoenix as country-music legend Johnny Cash and Reese Witherspoon as his muse, singing partner, and stubborn romantic foil June Carter, is a big, juicy, enjoyable wide-canvas biography with a handful of indelible moments, but it's just compelling enough to make you wish that it had attained the level of artistry of those other films.
That said, I can't stop thinking about scenes like the one in which Cash, as a young singer in Memphis in the mid-'50s, enters the storefront that houses Sun Records and performs a gospel standard for Sam Phillips (played with sly feelers by Dallas Roberts), who dismisses the number as treacle. He then asks Cash: If you had an accident, were dying on the road, and had to sing one song to express how you felt about life, what would it be? With nothing to lose, Cash launches into ''Folsom Prison Blues,'' and suddenly we hear the famous gravity  the ominous lyrics and weirdly overdeliberate bass voice that sounds like it's trying to negotiate its way out of hell. As the band trickles in, Cash's thrilling rockabilly freight train leaves the station.
Phoenix, who did all his own singing, sounds just enough like Cash to make us hear the beauty of his husky reticence, and though he's hardly the singer's physical double  Cash had his trademark crags and furrows even when he was starting out  we can see how nature equipped him to play the Man in Black. His hair is black, his eyebrows are black, and, more than that, his eyes are black  deep coal wells of hidden sorrow. Walk the Line , directed by James Mangold (Cop Land) from a script he co-wrote with Gill Dennis, lays out Cash's demons in a vigorous if standard fashion. Growing up on a farm in Arkansas, young J.R. endures a stern father (Robert Patrick) who makes him feel responsible for his brother's death. Overseas, in the Air Force, he develops an identification with criminals, and Phoenix cultivates a haunted stare that masks a heart of vulnerability. Later, touring with Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis (Cash may be showcased as country, but it's a revelation to see how much of a vintage early rocker he really was), Cash, holding his guitar up high as if it were a shield, and then staring the audience down, expiates his sins through music. He could be a preacher whose sermons have gone electric.
As a portrait of Johnny Cash the gravel-voiced country-rock innovator, who projected a private hellfire onto even his jauntiest anthems, Walk the Line  is zesty and satisfying. But when it turns to the tale of how Cash, trapped in a miserable marriage, spent year after year courting, seducing, loving, yet never quite winning June Carter, the movie is on shakier ground. On the road, Cash enjoys groupies and pops amphetamines, an addiction that will land him in trouble with the law. Yet he's really a gentle soul who yearns to be loved. He and Carter begin to make eyes at each other the moment they meet backstage, and when Carter's first marriage ends, there appears to be little in the way of their getting together. But Carter, the scion of a famously traditional Christian singing family, feels guilty about her divorce, and Cash, after coercing her into performing a duet she wrote with her ex-husband, makes the mistake of giving her an onstage peck on the cheek. Horrors!
It's a downhill spiral from there. Walk the Line  could turn out to be a monster chick flick, because its design is almost mythic: Saintly girl has to wait for country-rock bad boy to purge his demons and settle down. But while Witherspoon, a fine singer herself, makes Carter immensely likable, a fountain of warmth and cheer, given how sweetly she meshes with Phoe-nix her romantic reticence isn't really filled in. June's refusal to countenance Johnny's drug use may be a fair obstacle, but the main reason he's doing drugs is that she keeps spurning him; he's numbing the pain of his devotion. June is made to seem like a high school virgin protecting her honor, and when we see her composing the lyrics to ''Ring of Fire,'' it doesn't compute: As written, this perky, straight-and-narrow woman is the last person on earth who would fall, through love, ''into a burning ring of fire.''
At the famous Folsom Prison concert, Cash performs ''Cocaine Blues,'' and Phoenix's eyes go wild with the pleasure of finally living up to his wrong-side-of-the-law image. Off stage, June beams at him. But do her eyes shine because of his generosity in saluting the humanity of these prisoners, or because of how deep his need is to feel like he's one of them? In Walk the Line , it's the former. In a greater movie, it would have been both.

 Correction Appended  MOVIES based on the lives of popular musicians constitute a durable genre in Hollywood, and also a fairly safe one. While not many of them rise to the level of greatness - "Coal Miner's Daughter," Michael Apted's life of Loretta Lynn, comes closer than most - there are very few that manage to be completely unwatchable, though "De-Lovely" certainly tried.  "Walk the Line," James Mangold's movie about Johnny Cash, settles down in the fat middle of the bell curve, providing, if nothing else, an excuse to go out and buy some CD's. Well cast, competently written (by Mr. Mangold and Gill Dennis) and carefully costumed, it adheres to a familiar "Behind the Music" formula, following its subject through childhood trauma, marriage and divorce, alternating off-stage melodrama with recreated performances that remind us why we should care about this guy in the first place.  Comparisons with Taylor Hackford's "Ray," which opened around this time last year, are inevitable. Both pictures place on the shoulders of their relatively young stars - Jamie Foxx and, in this case, Joaquin Phoenix - the burden of impersonating characters whose real voices, faces and mannerisms could hardly be better known. (For good measure, "Walk the Line" also gives us brief glimpses of actors playing Elvis Presley, Roy Orbison, Waylon Jennings and Jerry Lee Lewis.)  There are, moreover, some striking biographical similarities between Johnny Cash and Ray Charles, both of whom worked with the filmmakers telling their stories, though neither lived to see the final product. Like "Ray,"  "Walk the Line" tells the tale of a poor Southerner, born in the early years of the Great Depression, whose childhood was marked by the death of a beloved brother. Between the humble beginnings and the eventual immortality come events that seem almost interchangeable, more like stock situations than lived experiences. Vintage tour buses rumble down nighttime back roads. Drug habits are acquired - heroin for Charles, prescription pills for Cash  - leading to trouble with the law and painful scenes of withdrawal. The houses and the record labels get bigger (Charles moved from Atlantic to ABC, Cash from Sun to Columbia), the groupies come and go, and the long-suffering wives and girlfriends occasionally burst into angry tears.  The crucial difference, and the main reason that "Walk the Line" proves to be the lesser film, lies in the way the movies deal with the music that is, after all, their reason for existing. Mr. Hackford structured his film around Ray Charles's creative life, inviting us to understand how he fused various elements of the American musical vernacular into a new and distinctive sound. While Johnny Cash achieved something comparable, Mr. Mangold's film offers more tribute than insight. As he leaves home for the Air Force, Johnny's mother (Shelby Lynne) presses her book of hymns into his hands, and before long we see him, while stationed in Germany, working on what will become "Folsom Prison Blues." (Later, June Carter makes notes for "Ring of Fire," though in the film's chronology she appears to be doing so several years after the song was first recorded.)  When Cash and his combo audition at Sun Records, Sam Phillips (Dallas Roberts) stops them in the middle of a pallid gospel tune and harangues Cash about the importance of honest, raw emotion, advice that elicits "Folsom Prison Blues" and a recording contract. The most popular version of this story is a lot punchier than what is on screen. "Go home and sin," Phillips is supposed to have said, "and then come back with a song I can sell."  A great many songs and recordings followed, of course, of a richness and variety that very few American artists have equaled. Cash's bottomless voice and the steady, churning rhythms stayed constant, but the sheer range of material is staggering: murder ballads, love songs, novelty numbers, pop covers, gospel standards, all sung with mean wit and heartbreaking sincerity.  There is no way a feature-length movie could do justice to such bounty, and "Walk the Line" settles for the minimum. The religious conviction and social conscience that informed some of Cash's most enduring songs are all but erased, as the picture dwells mainly on the most accessible, least provocative aspects of his musical legacy - the early, rockabilly-tinged Sun sides, the early-60's hits and, of course, the duets with June Carter, played by Reese Witherspoon.  Cash and Carter's long infatuation, tumultuous partnership and eventual marriage provide the film with an emotional core. Johnny's first wife, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), aspires above all to middle-class normalcy and material comfort, and while the filmmakers try to show her some sympathy, she doesn't stand much of a chance next to June. Ms. Witherspoon's lively, smart performance suggests a mixture of warmth and brisk professionalism, qualities the actress and the singer clearly share. But most of June's own drama - the collapse of her two marriages before she finally said yes to Johnny, the pressures of growing up in a show-business family - takes place off screen, which makes the character feel a bit incomplete.  Then again, so does Johnny himself, in spite of Mr. Phoenix's sweating, quivery intensity. The premise of his performance seems to be that Cash, a shy, diffident, almost inarticulate fellow in daily life, found his rage, humor and charisma onstage, and Mr. Phoenix does a good job of conveying this transformation. Even though his singing voice doesn't match the original - how could it? - he is most convincing in concert, when his shoulders tighten and he cocks his head to one side. Otherwise, he seems stuck in the kind of off-the-rack psychological straitjacket in which Hollywood likes to confine troubled geniuses.  Johnny's father, Ray (Robert Patrick), is cold and critical, compounding the feelings of guilt and inadequacy that arose from the death of Johnny's older brother, Jack (Lucas Till), in a sawmill accident. But as is often true in narratives like this, the childhood hardships and psychological scars explain both too much and too little. Emoting plus music does not add up to art, and Mr. Phoenix's Johnny Cash, after more than two hours, remains stranded in the no man's land between cliché and enigma.  The decision to make new versions of Cash's songs rather than have the actors lip-sync over existing recordings (as Mr. Foxx did in "Ray") was a risky one. The results are respectable, if rarely transporting. There are only two moments likely to raise goose bumps: Ms. Witherspoon singing the Carter Family staple "Wildwood Flower," accompanying herself on autoharp, and Mr. Phoenix lurching into an out-of-control rendition of "I Got Stripes" that ends in drug-fueled collapse. Otherwise, you have to wait until the final credits to be reminded of what Johnny Cash and June Carter really sounded like. Their disembodied voices carry more presence, more humor and hurt, than anything in the movie itself, which honors them without quite capturing who they were.  "Walk the Line" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has hints of extramarital sex, some prescription drug abuse and a few four-letter words.
The Johnny Cash  biopic Walk the Line  is less a booze 'n' Benzedrine showbiz inspirationalalthough there is plenty of thatthan a love story. A few hotel rooms get trashed; the Man in Black is busted and, ultimately, re-hah-bilitated. But it's not success, kicks, or salvation that Cash (Joaquin Phoenix ) pursues so much as a lifelong yen for fellow country musician June Carter  (Reese Witherspoon ).
Directed by James Mangold  from a script co-written with Gill Dennis , Walk the Line  is an epic weepie, filled with signs and portents, as well as music. Even more than its subject, the movie may look mean but it walks the straight and narrowwith every one of Cash's greatest hits cued by a biographical event, usually reflecting the current state of his relationship with June. Given this ability to reconcile at least some of Cash's contradictions, Walk the Line  seems likely to strike a responsive chord.
Cash may have been a lesser artist than his near exact contemporary and fellow great American Ray Charles whose 2004 Oscar-worthy Hollywoodization Ray  provides Walk the Line 's probable model and inescapable parallelbut he was arguably the greater icon. RC was a musical genius; JC's genius is manifest in the pitch-perfect Righteous Outlawism of his 1968 concept album Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison . (Not exactly Sgt. Pepper's  but, as we now know, not exactly a "live" document either.) Fittingly, Walk the Line  begins with a rising ka-chunk ka-chunk vamp as Cash prepares to make his Folsom  entrance. He flashes back to memories of his Arkansas childhood on the WPA agricultural cooperative Dyess Colony, recalling the voice of 10-year-old June, the Carter Family ingenue, wafting out of the radio.
An extremely leisurely script takes 136 minutes to hit the high points: the accidental death of Cash's brother (a childhood trauma shared with RC); the hero's induction into the army (where he has another premonition of June, watches the 1951 B movie Inside the Walls of Folsom Prison , and writes "Folsom Prison Blues" line by line); his audition for Sam Phillips  at Sun Records (for which he first dresses in black); his riotous tour with Sun's star rockabillies Jerry Lee Lewis  (an amusingly fey interpretation by Waylon Malloy Payne ) and Elvis Presley  (a totally wired Tyler Hilton ); and finally, June flitting adorably through the proceedings.
Phoenix's skillful, focused, and essentially self-effacing performance is predicated on a Kabuki-like control of certain evocative expressions and body language. Somewhat showier, Witherspoon's June is a big-haired Kewpie doll with an iron will and a syncopated sashay. Where the first Mrs. Cash (Ginnifer Goodwin ) is a bourgeois shrew, June immediately sees Johnny's sensitive side, as well as his talent, and turns him on to The Prophet something he was still talking about 40 years later. Alternately wholesome and tortuous, their prolonged courtship is largely played out onstage. It's a marriage made in show business heaven, and in the movie (as in life?), their duetsapparently filmed before an actual audienceprovide most of the chemistry.
But what chemistry created Johnny Cash? Seconding the illuminating obit Tom Smucker wrote in the Voice  , I'd hazard Cash's childhood on a New Deal (and not inconsequentially, all-white) kolkhoz had something to do with his social valuesand maybe even musical ones. Did the Almanac Singers or Woody Guthrie  ever play Dyess Colony? A Bible-schooled folkie, Bob Dylan 's spiritual half brother, Cash projected a unique auraand we'd need something like Martin Scorsese 's Dylan doc to capture it. At once dangerous and benign, working-class hero and gospel Christian, bleeding heart and good ol' boy, at home on Hee Haw   and in Hootenanny Hoot , part Elvis and part John Wayne  and far more likable than either, Cash was and remains a rich, fascinating, self- invented characterwhich kind of leaves his impersonator out in the cold.
The fact is that neither Walk the Line  nor the even more tedious Ray   exerts nearly the fascination of last year's Beyond the Sea , an obviously bad movie about a limited performer of minor cultural significance and yet a weirdly compelling psychodrama, allowing director-star Kevin Spacey  to match Bobby Darin 's patented insincerity with his own. In no way obsessive, Walk the Line  is more sincerelywhich is to say, more boringlysincere. It doesn't leave you with much to think about, except maybe the empty vibrato of effective ventriloquism.
