Back around the turn of the century, music-video director Pellington carved out a small and unnerving patch of the film universe for himself. At the time he was a rarity: a visual stylist who was able to parlay his disturbing 3�-minute melodramas (exemplified by his award-winning video for Pearl Jam�s �Jeremy�) into a career in Hollywood. His wonderfully odd debut, Going All the Way
, put a violent, post-Freudian spin on the age-old teenage sex-comedy formula, while Arlington Road
 is still one of the best Hollywood movies to pull the fear and paranoia of political terrorism out of the corridors of power and drop it into our living rooms. Now, after spending the past six years in the relative comfort of television and U2�s great big, loving, lucrative arms (U2 3D
), it appears that good old disturbing Pellington has officially gone soft. Though his latest, Henry Poole Is Here
, is full of all his usual ultrastylized, ultradark visual experimentation � an aesthetic that makes viewers feel like they�re drowning in an ocean of uncomfortable childhood memories � its story couldn�t be more corny, redemptive, or inspirational. Wilson plays Henry Poole, a bloated, unshaven drunk who buys a house in his old neighborhood and spends his days in quiet self-loathing, hoping not to be bothered. Unfortunately for him, he�s got the world heavyweight champion of meddling neighbors in Esperanza (Barraza), a good-natured busybody whose interest turns to obsession when she decides a water stain on the outside wall of Poole�s house is actually a portrait of Jesus, complete with bloody tears and healing powers. Soon, Poole�s house has become a holy destination, not just for the pilgrims in Esperanza�s church but also for the damaged woman next door (Mitchell) and her mute daughter (Lily, who, like this movie, flip-flops between creepy and adorable with remarkable speed and dexterity), and poor, reclusive Poole is being taught some valuable, if unwanted, lessons about the importance of friendship, the joy of love, and the all-consuming grace and mercy of Jesus Christ. I don�t know if Pellington found religion recently, but I do know you have to wonder about the artistic health and decision-making abilities of any filmmaker who looks for divinity in shots of sunlight pouring out from behind clouds. All that�s missing from the director�s new vision of the world is the pipe organ and the choir of angels.


"Henry Poole Is Here" manages a fairly rare trick: It's a movie that's both deeply felt and completely phony.
Written by first-time screenwriter Albert Torres and directed by Mark Pellington ("Arlington Road," "The Mothman Prophecies," many rock videos), it's a self-consciously "small" drama set in an out-of-the-way Los Angeles neighborhood. The title character (Luke Wilson, bearded and glowering) appears one day and buys a shabby stucco house down the street from his childhood home. He proceeds to start drinking himself to death, fueled by a source of anger revealed during the course of the film.
Henry has lost all hope, see, but the woman next door (Adriana Barraza of "Babel") is conveniently named Esperanza, Spanish for "hope." The radiantly pretty, conveniently single mom on the other side is named Dawn (Radha Mitchell). Even the supermarket check-out girl's on his case: Her name (conveniently) is Patience (Rachel Seiferth).
Oh, and Jesus Christ himself turns up in a water-stain on the side of Henry's house. This development brings the devoutly Catholic Esperanza first to her knees, then to fetch her priest (George Lopez, wearing what for him amounts to a restraining collar). Henry, wallowing in self-pity, will have none of it, and in his defense, the stain really looks more like the Zig-Zag rolling papers guy. But then the miracles start happening.
OK, then. This is interesting: A parable on faith that only gradually tips its Christian hand. "Henry Poole Is Here" is far from evangelical, though: It's a gently spiritual inquiry aimed at doubters. Such things are not unwelcome, especially coming from Hollywood. They just need to be a lot better made than this one is.
There's not one moment in "Henry Poole" that feels natural or unforced - remarkable for a movie that misperceives itself as a work of indie realism. Torres's idea of working-class dialogue is to have the characters mutter self-consciously; some of the actors run with it but Wilson flails from beginning to end. A further warning sign: Dawn has an adorably precocious 6-year-old daughter named Millie (Morgan Lily), who wanders around tape-recording the adults, playing back their conversations as a sort of group insta-therapy. Why she's not named Dramatic Closure I have no idea.
Perhaps the movie's worst sin is its reliance on pop music - specifically, downer alt-rock ballads - to cue emotions the filmmaking's too inept to foster on its own. Time and again, Pellington slams the movie to a halt for a mopey montage scored to an Eels or Badly Drawn Boy song, and by the fourth or fifth time, you're groaning. This isn't directing; it's playlisting.
According to recent articles, the filmmaker has weathered some family tragedies and sees "Henry Poole Is Here" as a way to reprioritize - to talk about the things that matter. You're allowed to feel for him and still wonder why the results feel so airlessly over-determined whenever Hollywood filmmakers try to "get real" in films like "Crash" or 1993's "Falling Down" or this one.
Maybe living in the film industry's hall of mirrors fosters an inability to tell a story straight, without calculated pre-chewing. Maybe filmmakers like Pellington have lost the knack for letting a narrative organically unfold. Maybe he just needs to get out of LA. One thing's certain: To make a movie about the necessity of faith, it helps to have a little in your audience.


Luke Wilson, playing that mopey-ironic note he plays so...consistently , portrays a depressed dude in Henry Poole Is Here  who declares that he ''won't be around'' for long. He then discovers that the water stain on the back wall of his new ranch house may be the face of Jesus. (Yes, it bleeds tears.) It's tragic that Mark Pellington, the talented director of The Mothman Prophecies , lost his wife four years ago, but he has made an autobiographical saga of grief that is gooey, ponderous, and maudlin. It's less a tale of religious rebirth than a faith-based Hallmark card.

 With characters named Esperanza, Dawn and Patience that signal Deeper Meaning, “Henry Poole Is Here” traffics in the kind of inspirational kitsch that only a true believer could swallow. Those convinced that faith can literally move mountains may welcome a film whose characters discuss spiritual issues, although there are no grand tectonic shifts in the landscape. In the film, directed by Mark Pellington (“Arlington Road”) from a screenplay by Albert Torres, the miracles wrought by feeling a mystical connection with a mysterious reddish stain on the side of a stucco house are less earthshaking and have to do with physical and mental health.  That house is purchased by Henry Poole (Luke Wilson), a brooding American Everyman diagnosed with an unidentified terminal illness whose only visible symptoms are episodes of blotchy skin. Henry has returned to the Los Angeles neighborhood in which he grew up determined to die in slovenly solitude. While glumly waiting for the end, he comforts himself with vodka and Krispy Kreme doughnuts.  To his annoyance, his pesky neighbors refuse to leave him alone. The most persistent is the garrulous Mexican-American widow who lives next door, Esperanza (Adriana Barraza). She is the first to notice the stain, which contains a spot from which a bloodlike substance slowly drips. Certain that she has seen the face of God, she summons her pastor, Father Salazar (George Lopez), to inspect it, and as word gets around, visitors begin arriving to worship at the supposedly holy site.  Millie (Morgan Lily), an  8-year-old neighbor who hasn’t said a word since the breakup of her parents’ marriage, is also mysteriously drawn to the stain and miraculously begins talking again. Her beautiful, cookie-baking mother, Dawn (Radha Mitchell), just happens to be a perfect mate for Henry should he be roused from his morbid funk.  As Henry engages in furious verbal skirmishes with the true believers, Mr. Wilson offers a credible portrait of an angry, despairing man fending off a cult. But the film’s spiritual deck is stacked. In the mawkish tradition of movies like “Simon Birch,” “Wide Awake,” “August Rush” and “Hearts in Atlantis,” “Henry Poole Is Here” is insufferable hokum that takes itself very, very seriously.  “Henry Poole Is Here” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some strong language.

Because it's billed as a more personal project for Mark Pellington after a string of interesting, idiosyncratic thrillers ("Arlington Road," "The Mothman Prophecies"), "Henry Poole Is Here" is all the more disappointing. Pic's tendency to lecture on the power of faith and religion and on the demerits of science seems to assume an almost childlike audience that needs to be spoon-fed Pablum. This tale of a single man whose medical death sentence is reversed in part by a neighborhood of believers won't advance the profile of the always-likable Luke Wilson, and Christian moviegoers will have to show up in great numbers to keep the film from being doomed to something far less than sleeper status.
So insistent is the film that lack of belief in God is a personal failure, nonbelievers are likely to feel offended. Not since "The Passion of the Christ" has a mainstream Hollywood product insisted so firmly in faith while its deprecation of science and medicine has seemed singularly harsh.
In a Los Angeles suburb, glum Henry Poole purchases a slightly rundown home on a good street, refusing to negotiate the price with real estate agent Meg (Cheryl Hines). It looks like he's a property flipper; he indicates to neighbor Esperanza (Adrianna Barrazza) he appreciates her housewarming gift of tamales, but firmly makes it clear he wants to be left alone. The only other irritant for Poole is a large stain on an outside stucco wall of the house.
Then, the intrusions begin. Neighbor Dawn's (Radha Mitchell) gamin-faced daughter Millie (Morgan Lily), who hasn't spoken a word since her divorced father left a year ago, records sounds and conversations, and Henry hears one of his played back. Then Esperanza enters his backyard without permission and starts praying to the stain of the stucco wall, insisting to Henry it displays "the face of Christ."
Understandably peeved, particularly when Esperanza begins bringing over some of her church congregants and her priest, Father Salazar (George Lopez), to witness "the miracle," Henry wants everyone out. Esperanza asks him, "Don't you believe in God?", the question seemingly a grave accusation, implying Henry has some growing to do. Albert Torres' screenplay telegraphs that this eruption of faith will connect with and reverse Henry's fatalism, which he expresses enigmatically with, "I won't be here that long."
When Millie touches a tiny blood stain that has appeared on the "face" of the stain, and is suddenly able to resume talking, Henry seems heartless for denying the church flock their new shrine. In the meantime, the symbolically named Dawn grows emotionally close to Henry, though he seems only partly able to be open with her.
Awkwardly inserted flashbacks explain the gravity (if not the nature) of Henry's condition, with his doctor (Richard Benjamin) telling him he hasn't long to live. The doc's nurse, for good measure, is so inept that she can't apply a decent shot, just one of a few jabs here at medicine and science.
Add to all this Patience (Rachel Seiferth), the checkout clerk at Henry's grocery store, weighing in against science to Henry and citing no less than Noam Chomsky on the subject.
Wilson appears slightly pained in this performance, as if trying to find a way inside a guy who feels under the grip of fate, but who is never fleshed out on the page. By contrast, Mitchell is by far the warmest and most genuine contributor, exuding a natural sense of life and love that's irresistible. Support, including Mexican star Barrazza, is annoying.
As with all Pellington films, overall production qualities are first-class, though a deliberately bare look to the suburban neighborhood (actually, La Mirada, Calif.) is much less compelling than a similar 'hood in "Arlington Road." Use of innumerable songs to bridge scenes becomes risible.


Henry Poole  is dying. Diagnosed with an unspecified fatal disease, Poole (Luke Wilson ) retreats into the numbing sunniness of suburban Los Angeles, buying a cruddy house and waiting until his daily diet of doughnuts and liquor eventually does him in. Directed by Mark Pellington  (taking a break from thrillers like Arlington Road ), Henry Poole Is Here  tells the uplifting quasi-spiritual tale of how Poole's plan of going out Leaving Las Vegas –style fails thanks to a beautiful divorcée neighbor (Radha Mitchell ) and a mysterious stain on his house that resembles Christ's face and dispenses the occasional miracle. While his performance as a despondent atheist who learns to live and love is affecting in a low-key way, it's fun to interpret the soppy Henry Poole Is Here  as his sincere attempt to confront the post-adolescent male angst that his cinematic buddies usually laugh off. But Pellington applies his message—the necessity of hope—a trifle thickly over the proceedings, treating the Christ image's magical powers with such reverence that you're almost set up to expect an M. Night Shyamalan  third-act switcheroo. What you're left with instead is a film that could have used some of the genuine intrigue of Pellington's thrillers to help offset the increasingly doe-eyed narrative.
