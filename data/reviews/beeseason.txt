         A family sits at the heart of the evocative "Bee Season," a family with the expected insecurities, yearnings and doubts. But as those who know the work of directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel could predict, if "Bee Season" is a family drama, it's one of unforeseen daring, resonance and complexity.
 
  Those qualities and then some appear in Myla Goldberg's bestselling novel that adds esoteric Jewish mysticism, religious seeking and psychological trauma to a story of what transpires when 11-year-old elementary school student Eliza Naumann discovers an unanticipated gift for spelling words. Difficult and impressive words, the kind that allow you to win big at local and national spelling bees.
 


         






    McGehee and Scott, for their part, are coolly accomplished filmmakers whose belief in the ability of intelligent melodrama to reveal truths energized 2001's "The Deep End." Here again, they get a great deal out of a complex family dynamic.
 
  Despite its title and its plot line, "Bee Season" is not so much about spelling as it is about letters, the powers inherent in them and the way they form words. As Eliza says in the voice-over that starts the film, "My father told me once that individual letters hold all the secrets of the universe. Through them, I could reach the ear of God."
 
  This kind of material can be tricky, esoteric stuff, the kind that traditionally plays better on the page and takes some doing to get right on screen. Though it tinkers with the book — modifying chronology, moving the location from outside Philadelphia to Berkeley and even changing the sex of a character — this film takes the ambitious risk of being largely faithful to its source. With the help of clear direction and some excellent acting, especially from Flora Cross in a memorable debut as Eliza, "Bee Season" is affecting in ways that movies have all but given up trying to be.
 
  Credit for this also goes to writer Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal, whose Oscar-nominated script for "Running on Empty" showed a gift for family dynamics. Her fine "Bee Season" screenplay is about more than how letters form words, it's about how individuals come together to form a family, about what connects them and what pulls them apart.
 
  Initially, the Naumann family looks like a normal and happy one. Father Saul (Richard Gere) is a religious studies professor (changed from a cantor in the novel), mother Miriam (Juliette Binoche) is a scientist, and both children know their place in the family hierarchy.
 
  Older son Aaron (a strong Max Minghella, director Anthony's son), basks in being the favorite, while the younger Eliza doesn't mind being so low on the family food chain that when she wins her school's spelling bee she's too scared of her dad to come right out and tell him.
 
  As the wary, withdrawn dutiful daughter, Cross, a young actress with an exceptional face but no feature experience to speak of, does remarkable work. Her Eliza is completely her own person, emotionally undernourished by her family but surprisingly grounded. We like her so much we want her to keep winning; as we see the world through her eyes, everything becomes illuminated.
 
  Yet as much as we want Eliza to triumph, it becomes increasingly inescapable that her success is changing the Naumann family dynamic. Feeling displaced, Aaron becomes an increasingly secretive spiritual seeker. And Miriam (a breathtaking performance from Binoche) reacts to her daughter's success by retreating further into herself, into the grip of a mysterious series of behaviors.
 
  The family's most pronounced reaction is from Saul, who goes from barely knowing his daughter exists to seeing in her the fulfillment of his dreams. A student of the ancient mystical texts of the cabala (as opposed to the modern shrink-wrapped Madonna/Demi Moore version), he starts to view his daughter's success as a sign that she is spiritually gifted and begins to teach her arcane and potentially dangerous secrets of the 13th century mystic Abraham Abulafia.
 
  As an observant and very Jewish father, Gere is a problematic choice. On the one hand, his role as King David notwithstanding, the actor does not read at all Jewish on screen, and that is a hindrance to this very specific story's believability. On the other hand, Gere's interest in the spiritual qualities of Eastern religion helps him understand the role's background, and his long-standing ability to play characters who are narcissistic ultimately wins us over.
 
  "Bee Season" can't fully be understood apart from its particularly Jewish central concept of tikkun olam
, the healing or repairing of the world. The notion that it is a universal responsibility to fix what has been shattered, to attempt to restore what has been damaged, drives this story in tandem with the need all of its characters have, each in his or her own way, to seek transcendence by searching for a personal vision of God. "Bee Season" may start out looking conventional, but it is finally anything but.

Bee Season  answers the question no Talmudic student or fan of Unfaithful  has thought to ask: What would Richard Gere look like as a learned Jewish scholar and teacher? The answer is, much like the betrayed husband from Unfaithful   great hair, great wire-rim eyeglasses. Only instead of living the life of a WASP businessman named Ed, Gere's character is called Saul. And he lectures on matters of Jewish arcana to rapt students moved by his attractive silveriness as well as by his passion for Kabbalistic mysticism that's at once more rigorously erudite than Madonna's Red String brand, and equally, conveniently, spiritual rather than religious.
Then Saul comes home to a house very much like Ed's Westchester digs, filled with comfortable furniture and comfortably secular family problems familiar to all who live in a therapized world: While quiet daughter Eliza (newcomer Flora Cross) emerges, to the surprise and obsession of her father, as a whiz at spelling bees with an almost mystical ability to ''inhabit'' the letters she enunciates, older brother Aaron (Max Minghella, son of director Anthony Minghella), who previously held the position of favored smart child, feels neglected and is drawn to a proselytizing cult. Meanwhile, Saul's wife, Miriam (French actress Juliette Binoche, to whom Paris-born Cross bears an uncanny physical resemblance), becomes more and more psychologically unstable, in ways that leave Saul dumb as a husband, however brilliant he is as an academic. And while Saul teaches the Kabbalistic concept of repairing a shattered world, Eliza becomes the conduit for fixing a broken family.
Directed by The Deep End 's Scott McGehee and David Siegel from a script by Running on Empty  screenwriter Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal (mother of those Gyllenhaals), Bee Season  shows a fondness for photographing things that shimmer  letters in the air, crystals. The movie works earnestly to transform unfamiliar concepts of philosophy as well as by now exceedingly familiar concepts of endearing/sadistic spelling-bee hysteria into cinematically new representations of letters made flesh. But that same ecumenical earnestness, with its mild message of nonsectarian interpersonal healing, contradicts the restlessness, incandescence, and specificity so intrinsic to the story of a girl who feels one with the word.

Tepid literary adaptations are a dime a remainder pile, but even someone unacquainted with Myla Goldberg 's much admired 2000 novel Bee Season  might get a whiff of the lamp burning holes through its screen projection. Scott McGehee  and David Siegel 's two previous features, the psychological thrillers Suture  (1993) and The Deep End  (2001), cultivated a chilly opacity of tone and a studied ambiguity in key aspects of plotting and staging. The directors' aptitude for gleaming obliquity might well have conducted the mystical amperage of Goldberg's novelhere relocated from Philadelphia to a moneyed Oakland suburbin which the ostensibly "unimpressive fifth-grader" Eliza Naumann  ascends the spelling-bee ranks in a strange tandem with her family's fragmentation and collapse. Unfortunately, the celluloid Naumanns (as screenwritten by Naomi Foner Gyllenhaal) are mere vestiges of their source, bearing all the familiar marks of the mistranslated book characterthey're at turns shallow and inscrutable, their pathways tweezed into overdetermined vectors.
Before she wins her first spelling trophy, stoic Eliza (Flora Cross) occupies at best an auxiliary role in the mind of her control freak dad, Saul (Richard Gere ), a religious-studies professor whose amply showcased intellectual, spiritual, and culinary prowess holds his entire household in a benign tyrannyof supreme competence. As might any flabbergasted viewer of the documentary Spellbound , Saul gets a case of the gnostics as Eliza's seemingly sourceless orthographic gifts come into focus; he dumps his pet teenage son, Aaron (Max Minghella ), in favor of intensive training with his new chosen one in Kabbalah, hoping to help Eliza unlock the "primal energy" contained in the sacred letters of the Hebrew alphabet. (Though Cross is a radiant, steadying presence as Eliza, would that Bee Season  had provided the debutante screen role for Lourdes Leon .)
As Eliza makes legible the mysteries of the sefirot , her brother and mother's behavior becomes increasingly garbled. Stung by the fickleness of his father's own primal energies (Gere's performance strikes a perfect balance of jocular egotism and striver edginess), Hebrew-school ace Aaron goes impulse shopping at first a church and then, more pivotally, an ashram after a chance encounter with Hare Krishna sylph Chali (Kate Bosworth ), who brightly intones, "Something's missing . . . from your life." Same goes for chronically anguished mom Miriam (Juliette Binoche ), who's beset by flashbacks to her parents' death in a car accident and keeps finding herself in strangers' apartments. Oddly, the movie internalizes Daddy's formidable self-regard by presenting Aaron and Miriam's spiritual disarray as a mess of Saul's own making, while Aaron's absurdly petulant reaction to his pensive little sister's spelling tutorials leaves his bhakti in serious doubt.
Just as The Deep End nearly drowned in its liquid symbolism, Bee Season  indulges many a runic omenthe portentous credit sequence tracks a massive letter A  dangling from a helicopterbut the visual effects do effect a playful semiotic suture: Asked to spell dandelion, the visionary Eliza shuts her eyes and wills imaginary seeds to draw the letters in the air; given cotyledon , calligraphic plant life sprouts from her flowered blouse. Indeed, much of the film's imagery tends an expressionist garden, from the autumnal shades of Michael E. Goldman 's art direction to the nearly cartoonish lushness of the Naumanns' backyard, as captured in Giles Nuttgens 's beautiful cinematography. But the abundant warmth and color of the impeccable surfaces don't infuse the characterizations or illuminate the movie's final epiphany. The entire film drives toward one person's momentous decision, but why the choice is made, and how it apparently enables catharsis for the whole family, remain bafflingly obscure. The mysticism only mystifies; its hieroglyphics are vividly rendered, but Bee Season  never manages to spell them out.
