Featuring as it does shape-shifting fungal porcupines from outer space, Splinter
 handily wins this month's "Whaaa �?!" competition by a huge, um, prick. Granted, the only other entrants are Saw V
 and Quarantine
, but they're both masterful exercises in pure logic and conservative plotting compared with this wild ride into headache-inducing shaky-cam land. Splinter
 initially gets by on sheer weirdness alone; reanimated roadkill sprouting wicked-looking black spines is not a horror trope I've come across before. Too soon though, it metastasizes into just one more film about honeymooners and white-trashers trapped in a rural gas station by things unknown. It's a smallish subgenre, which also includes Stephen King's Maximum Overdrive
 and Robert R. McCammon's Nightcrawlers
 (the latter adapted by William Friedkin for CBS' mid-Eighties Twilight Zone
 restart), and it riffs on genre godfather George Romero's original Night of the Living Dead
 but manages none of that nightmare's doomster wit or gut-churning horror. Here, Costanzo and Wagner are a mismatched pair of young lovers � Costanzo's Seth is first portrayed as an emasculated, bespectacled  wuss, Wagner's Polly as a leggy, blond �berfrau � who are carjacked by Whigham's gun-toting convict Dennis and his tweaker squeeze Lacey (Kerbs) while camping out on Rural Route, USA. Whigham (Wristcutters: A Love Story
) is the best thing Splinter
 has going for it. His bandit-on-the-lam skittishness plays into the film's overall sense of minor-league paranoia, but it's hardly enough to qualify as a groundbreaking performance. The only truly jarring moments happen in macro shots of the parasitic creature's nasty pokers extruding from the pores of the dead and soon-to-be-dead. It's a totally original concept, monsterwise, and appreciated as such, but you come away from Splinter
 feeling it would have made a far more effective short than the feature-length drag it is.

A hideous parasite/monster/thing  that leaps out from the darkness and flings its deadly thorns at unsuspecting gas-station attendants/troubled women/others-to-be-named-later can be a beautiful sight. It sure is in Splinter , a nifty horror movie that doesn’t claim to be anything other than a zippy exercise in creature-feature entertainment. And on that score, this lithe, low-budget people-versus- insatiable-bloodsucker comedy of horrors works like a charm. Or is it an expert curse?
Toby Wilkins, a British visual-effects pro, makes his fine, scary-funny, gore-splattered feature directorial debut after a series of fan-fave shorts. His splinter-spewing entity, which turns victims into undead hosts, is itself barely seen; it's the needle-stuck who receive the F/X love, with even more attention lavished on psychological shifts among a trio of squabblers who lock themselves into a forlorn, fluorescent-lit gas station and peer nervously into the blackness. The threesome  an imposingly competent, outdoorsy young woman (Jill Wagner), her wussy, indoorsy scientist husband (Paulo Costanzo), and a short- tempered, carjacking escaped con (Shea Whigham, hunky as a baddie)  may have issues with one another. But they had better find a way to bond, hadn't they, if they want to save their hides from a stick in the pants?

 At the beginning of “Splinter,” a diverting if not terribly original on-the-cheap horror film, a gas-station attendant is eating potato chips when a howling spiny creature suddenly eats him.  The proper opening note of grisly absurdism having been struck, the scene shifts to two couples: Seth (Paulo Costanzo) and Polly (Jill Wagner), who are out on an anniversary camping trip, and Dennis (Shea Whigham, who can also be seen in “Pride and Glory”) and Lacey (Rachel Kerbs), who are armed, on the lam, kicking a drug habit and prone to swearing even when it makes no grammatical sense. These four will spend the next  90 minutes or so bickering and fighting off the strange, spiky predators, who turn the bodies of their victims into spastic, ravenous porcupine zombies.  Working from an efficient, bare-bones script by Ian Shorr and Kai Barry, the director, Toby Wilkins, honors the conventions of the genre with skill and enough wit to keep the scares sharp. The monsters — whose sudden appearance on the landscape is never explained, but whose habits are analyzed by Seth, a biology grad student — are as gruesome as zombies and as creepy as bugs. Their spines bore into flesh, consume blood and transform dead bodies (and even severed limbs) into lurching flesh-eaters.  After Polly and Seth are carjacked by Dennis and Lacey, the two couples spend a long, bloody, tense night at a convenience store. The situation is fairly basic and doesn’t have the psychological or sociological nuance that distinguishes similar scenarios in George Romero’s “Living Dead” movies. But even though the characters conform to every expected stereotype, the acting is reasonably convincing. And the monsters travel light, unburdened by allegorical baggage. What are they supposed to be? I don’t know. Just really gross and scary, I think.  “Splinter” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has graphic violence and abundant profanity.

F/x whiz Toby Wilkins' "Splinter" is a spare, effective and genuinely frightening retro-nightmare that will have teenage gore girls trooping to the movies like lurching swarms of George Romero's living dead. The socio-sexual-psychological attraction of "Splinter" -- which just won a rash of awards at Screamfest in Los Angeles -- will constitute as much of the film's draw as Quantum Creation's human sea urchins or the generous portions of blood served up by Wilkins and his makeup peeps. It's a chick flick with hemoglobin -- and a Halloween opening wasn't a bad idea, either. 
Clearly out to evoke '70s horror, "Splinter" kicks off with a twist on the twisted familiar: Seth (Paulo Costanzo) and Polly (Jill Wagner) are going camping -- bad idea -- but they can't get the tent up. But hold on: It's when they get back into the presumed safety of their SUV (there's a subliminal green message in there somewhere) that they're abducted by the malignant Dennis (Shea Whigham) and his crystal meth-addled girlfriend, Lacey (Rachel Kerbs). What initially seems to be shaping up as a hostage drama a la "The Desperate Hours," however, becomes something very different indeed.
Dennis is a wonderfully hateful thug, who immediately zeroes in on the intellectual Seth and makes him look weak in front of Polly, who's been driving their SUV. (Seth can't drive stick! A sure sign of weenie-hood.) But then Polly runs over some animal that looks like a road pie with spines, and Lacey starts talking to it, thinking it's her long lost dog Ginger (you knows she's a goner).
But the Thing, this spiny, splintery mass, trails our scream quartet and backs them into a convenience store. There, the proprietor has already been reduced to a bloody, needle-y mass, and the three (yes, we're down to three) fight for their lives, with all the duct tape, wire hangers and fireworks they need to keep the porcupine-ish menace at bay.
The mechanics of "Splinter" are remarkably sound -- the script moves from place to place with a minimal amount of implausibility, once you get beyond the raging-mold-spore theory by which Seth (conveniently, a Ph.D candidate in biology) figures out what's out there. The convenience store is a character all its own.
But it's Polly who's the engine of all this: She can't help but respond, however subtly, to Dennis' man of action while disdaining Seth in his more brainiac moments. Seth acquits himself admirably enough, but Wagner (yes, boys, the spokesmodel in all those Lincoln-Mercury ads), does a wonderful job of internalizing Polly's wavering allegiance to strong Seth vs. cerebral Seth, mirroring the kinds of psychosexual debates raging among the likely aud for this taut little bloodbath.
The effects, used rather smartly and sparingly, are great: The disembodied hand that chases the characters around their ersatz 7-Eleven is vaguely comical, but only because it's so terrifying. There's not a lot of explanation about where the splinters come from, aside from Seth's scientific theory about heat and cold and a monster that operates on a purely cellular basis. In an era of environmental awareness, Wilkins seems to be after a deeper, nuanced message than pure horror, punctuated by his "Kiss Me Deadly"-style ending.

In a horror movie, to go on a camping trip is to march toward a certain and grisly death, usually at the hands of an escaped killer or fanged monster. Seth (Paulo Costanzo ) and Polly (Jill Wagner ), the foolhardy campers of the terrifically taut Splinter , encounter both. Initially, they're carjacked and kidnapped by a convict (Shea Whigham ) and his drug-addled girlfriend (Rachel Kerbs ), but it isn't long before all four band together to fend off blood-oozing human mutants. One or more of the four may even turn mutant themselves, thanks to the prick of sharp, quill-like splinters whose origins can't possibly be of this earth. In an impressive debut, English director Toby Wilkins  and screenwriters Ian Shorr  and Kai Barry  don't fuss over otherworldly explanations, but instead focus on exploring all the ways four people can be hunted down and turned to pulp while hiding inside a gas-station food mart. Buoyed by solid ensemble work, some yuckily effective special effects, and a script that subverts genre convention by having its characters do smart things instead of stupid ones (mostly), Splinter  earns our respect while delivering 82 minutes of lean, mean fun.
