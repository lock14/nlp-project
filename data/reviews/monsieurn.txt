as Elvis abducted by aliens? Did Hitler flee to South America? Some people are so famous (or infamous) in their lifetimes that we refuse to let them rest in peace. For the French, the circumstances of Napoleon Bonaparte's death in 1821 on the island of St. Helena conjure the same tantalizing fantasy of a demigod who will not die. "Monsieur N," Antoine de Caunes's densely plotted costume drama, suggests that Napoleon's demise might have been an elaborate hoax through which he escaped into anonymity. It's not the first movie to make such a proposal. "The Emperor's New Clothes" (with Ian Holm as Napoleon) offered a variation of the same notion. The heart of the movie, which flashes back from Paris in 1840, when Napoleon's body was exhumed and returned to Paris, to his final years in exile, is set on the bleak, windswept island in the south Atlantic. Contrary to what you might have assumed from high school history books, the emperor (Philippe Torreton) wasn't simply cast away on a rock and left to fend for himself. He was guarded by 3,000 British soldiers, 1,000 of whom kept watch over his residence at Longwood House. A flotilla of battleships patrolled the island, where he was attended in the imperial manner by the remnants of his loyal staff, among them Mar�chal Bertrand (Roschdy Zem), Generals Montholon (St�phane Freiss) and Gourgaud (Fr�d�ric Pierrot) and their families; his butler, Cipriani (Bruno Putzulu); and his manservant, Ali (Igor Skreblin). The cost of his imprisonment in the royal style to which he was accustomed was a major financial headache to the British, who desperately tried to impose budgetary restraints. "Monsieur N" is narrated by Basil Heathcote (Jay Rodan), a young lieutenant assigned as a liaison between the emperor's staff, and Sir Hudson Lowe (Richard E. Grant), the British governor in charge of the island. The role of a raging control freak whose behavior is more stereotypically Napoleonic than Napoleon's, inspires Mr. Grant to strut his nastiest stuff as the most officious martinet ever to burst buttons on his uniform, preening and fuming in full Type-A mode. Before settling in to contemplate Napoleon's escape plan, which is presented as his ultimate strategic coup, the movie offers a heady dose of life on St. Helena, where the food and wine (imported by supply ship) are excellent but the boredom suffocating. While Napoleon dictates his memoirs to the toadying Montholon, Montholon's wife, Albine (Elsa Zylberstein), works overtime as the emperor's mistress (with her husband's approval.) Like everyone else on St. Helena, the couple is scheming to be left a hunk Napoleon's fortune. The arrival of Betsy Balcombe, (Siobhan Hewlett), a young English rose who throws herself at the emperor, threatens to derail the Montholons' plans. The film's vision of the exiled court consumed by spying, gossiping and jockeying for position presents a deliciously cold-eyed view of power and sycophancy. Napoleon may be an egomaniac, but he is a ruthless truth-teller who sees through every ploy and blandishment. Ren� Manzor's screenplay is peppered with the emperor's epigrammatic zingers, which reveal him as easily the smartest person in the room: "History belongs to those who tell it"; "Truth and history are poor bedfellows"; "Men will sacrifice reason to their imagination"; "Love doesn't lie in the past or the future, but in the present." He drives Betsy to tears with his warning, "There's no love in my bed, just favors and bills of exchange." Mr. Torreton's glowering emperor, one of the most compelling Napoleons ever imagined for the screen, exerts a magnetic, if slightly repellent spell. The actor's brooding glances and blunt remarks signal a tactical genius as aware of his impending mortality as he is of his addiction to power. Once the emperor's health deteriorates and he fades from the movie, "Monsieur N" redirects its energy to the escape plot, but it's not nearly as interesting as Mr. Torreton's layered performance. The narrative is complicated by its back-and-forth structure, which eventually turns the movie into an elaborate game of Clue. If it all adds up to too much for one film (even at 127 minutes) to encompass with ease, "Monsieur N," which opens today at Cinema Village in New York, is certainly richer than most of what you'll find on the History Channel.

An intricate, fetchingly lensed tale of historical speculation framed as a plausible thriller, "Monsieur N." takes the rhetorical gag "Who's buried in Grant's tomb?" and applies it to Napoleon Bonaparte. If those aren't the remains of General-cum-Emperor Napoleon the first -- who died on Saint Helena in 1821--then whose are they? And what really became of the short guy with the distinctive forelock about whom some 300,000 books have been written and whose legacy can work up a room of Frenchmen to this day?
Beautifully appointed Franco-British co-production is dramatically dense, neatly thesped and visually involving. Versatile funnyman Antoine de Caunes, whose career is shaping up as a Gallic reply to Steve Martin's, delivers an impressive sophomore feature (after "Les Morsures de l'aube"/Love Bites) that should do nicely at home and has a solid shot at the offshore market. Pic opens Feb. 12 in Gaul, and Berlin Panorama slot shouldn't hurt.
In a credits sequence set in 1840, a coffin is exhumed and opened in a downpour. Witnesses pronounce the occupant to be a well-preserved Napoleon. Story, told in voice-over by Basil Heathcote (Jay Rodan) -- the film's only composite character -- then backtracks to June 1815 when 20-year-old Lt. Heathcoate arrived on Saint Helena under the command of no-nonsense Sir Hudson Lowe (a delectably imperious Richard E. Grant).
As governor of the remote British outpost, Lowe's chief responsibility (one that 3,000 men help enforce) is to make certain the island's notorious prisoner Gen. Napoleon Bonaparte (Philippe Torreton) does not escape. Heathcoate lives at Longwood -- the musty house assigned to Napoleon and his handful of retainers -- and is under orders to make sure he spots the prisoner twice a day.
A small group of loyal followers accompanied Napoleon into exile: Marshal Bertrand (Roschdy Zem), Gen. Montholon (Stephen Freiss) and his wife Albine (Elsa Zylberstein), and Gen. Gourgaud (Frederic Pierrot). Also in residence is Cipriani (Bruno Putzulu), Napoleon's fellow Corsican and lifelong friend, who runs the household.
Having turned himself in to the British in the wake of Waterloo, Napoleon is very much a prisoner.  Nevertheless, he's managed to maintain a protocol-laden lifestyle worthy of Versailles.
Lowe is much troubled by the fact that Napoleon's captivity is costing England 8 million pounds a year and galled by the projected expense should he "live another 20!" His upkeep is costly, his impatient retainers would like to collect their presumed inheritance -- and arsenic is a popular item on the island to ward off rats. The disgraced emperor still has many admirers and sympathizers in the outside world as well, but closest and most problematic is Betsy Balcombe (Siobhan Hewlett), the fresh-faced teen daughter of a local civilian couple.
Heathcoate is smitten with Betsy, who only has eyes for Napoleon. But it's not until 1840, at the ceremony in Paris during which Napoleon's remains are interred at Les Invalides, that Heathcoate -- catching a glimpse of adult Betsy in the solemn crowd-- is compelled to track down the members of the emperor's erstwhile inner circle.
While tale bounces around in time and demands concentration, narrative is never confusing. Dialogue in appropriate mix of French and English is consistently sharp.
Torreton ("Captain Conan"), who gained 20 pounds for the role, is terrific. Grant hits the bull's-eye as the officious task master. Rodan carves a handsome presence as the junior officer assigned to accompany Napoleon on his walks and rides. Zylberstein scores as the conniving spouse who shares Napoleon's bed -- with her husband's tacit approval -- as the small French contingent jockeys for generous mention in the emperor's will.
Craggy vistas lensed in South Africa are gorgeous and the faintly glum, ever-dramatic light, expertly molded by Pierre Aim is deftly expressive. Hands-on producers Marie-Castille Mention-Schaar and Pierre Kubel have spared no expense in production design, props or costumes, all of which contribute to an aura of authenticity.
Stephan Eicher's score is a bit overblown in spots, but not to the point of distraction. It's just that with a premise as strong as this, "movie" music isn't really needed.

The coyly titled Napoleon  biopic Monsieur N. is framed as the memoirs of a British lieutenant who aims "not to rewrite history" butmore melodramatically"to shed some light on the puzzling events that I witnessed." The mystery begins on the colony of St. Helena, where the former emperor spent the last six years of his life in exile. St. Helena is "a prison barely visible on a map," Lieutenant Heathcote (Jay Rodan ) tells us, but it's barely a prison: Still protected by his old guard, Napoleon has the sympathies of most of the residents and lives like a king. When his new jailer (Richard E. Grant ) attempts to introduce himself, he's made to wait three days. Naively, the movie depicts the former conqueror as an innocuous authoritarian, writing his memoirs, speculating about a unified Europe, gardening, screwing, and beekeeping. The official story is that N. died of cancer, but alternative scenarios have long circulated: Why were large traces of arsenic found on his corpse? Why was the body of his butler (and possible half-brother) never located? And why, if Napoleon's confinement was costing the British 8 million pounds per month (and 3,000 soldiers), would his captors bother keeping him alive?
As spectacle, Monsieur N.  is often stodgy, laced with the stale exposition of Masterpiece Theater ; a few Visconti signifiers (Alain Delon  look-alike, climactic ballroom dance, old man contemplating impending obsolescence) feel largely unearned. But as modest conspiracy-mongering, the movie is perfectly robust, earning its dramatic impact from its classical sense of intrigue and Philippe Torreton 's testy performance in the title role. The widescreen cinematography helps to open up the stuffy interiorseven the fromage  aroma of the love quadrangle (Heathcote versus Napoleon for angelic Brit Betsy ; Betsy versus Napoleon's mistress for the man himself) wafts away in the breeze. Screenwriter René Manzor doesn't have his subject's genius for strategy, and the movie's last third gets bogged down in vertiginous flashbacks. But if the whodunit is ultimately deflated, Monsieur N.  has value for comparative nationalist mythmaking: The ending plays like the lighter side of JFK .
