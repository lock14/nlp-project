There's a magic trick in ``The Illusionist" and it's not one of the feats of prestidigitation performed onstage by Edward Norton. It's that a movie this old hat, with this motley a cast, should work as well as it does. Swankly produced and hopelessly corny, ``Illusionist" is like an overupholstered wing chair in the corner of a men's club -- you settle in only to be startled by how ridiculously comfy you are.
Based on a short story by the Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Steven Millhauser (originally published in 1990's ``The Barnum Museum"), ``The Illusionist" immediately plops us into the front row of a theater in Vienna, circa 1900.
An intense young man sits onstage, his grimace and Vandyke beard giving him a Mephistophelean air. He concentrates, the crowd rustles apprehensively, and suddenly the misty figure of a woman appears out of thin air. She reaches out to the audience, as if to impart something of great importance -- and a police inspector halts the proceedings, bringing in a line of officers to shut the show down. The audience is close to rioting.
Norton is Eisenheim, the illusionist -- a man of magnetic and mournful gravitas -- and the woman, the Du chess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel), his beloved. Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), a butcher's son poised for great things in the waning days of the Hapsburg Empire, is the point man for Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell). Sophie is engaged to the prince, who is not used to commoners taking his playthings away.
That's the set-up: Director Neil Burger lines up his characters like figures in a juicy stage melodrama, then cranks up the flashback machine.
The pleasure of ``The Illusionist" lies in its luxuriant belief in old-fashioned verities like character and storytelling; it's as thin as a sheet of marbled endpaper and as cleanly crafted. We learn of Eisenheim's rural beginnings, and of the childhood love between a rough boy and a pampered but ardent young noblewoman. We see the beginnings of the boy's gift for magic and understand that, like Robert Johnson meeting the Devil at the crossroads, his breakthrough has to be mysterious and unknown.
Eisenheim subsequently appears fully formed in fin de siecle Vienna and wows the paying customers with such baroque illusions as an orange tree that grows from a seed as the audience watches. This trick delights Chief Inspector Uhl, an intelligent but complacent fellow who considers himself an amateur magician.
The inspector has better things to do. After Eisenheim is reunited with Sophie and the depth of their passion revealed to the sadistic crown prince in a dangerous battle of wits at a palace command performance, Uhl is instructed to consider the illusionist public threat number one.
Beyond that I will not go, other than to advise against the foolishness of playing cards with a magician or with Edward Norton. ``The Illusionist" toys with loss and the madness of crowds, with European political maneuverings, the rise of the common man, and backstage bookkeeping, but at heart it's a rapturous con game -- like a locket that figures prominently in the plot, it shouldn't snap together logically, but it does.
As directed by Burger (whose only previous work was 2002's no-budget fake documentary ``Interview With the Assassin"), the movie's handsome in a pleasingly self-conscious way. It's been a while since we've been treated to such period splendor in the service of ``mere" entertainment: gowns swirling, gas lamps hissing, horse hooves clattering on the cobblestones. The opulent decor suckers us in, and Philip Glass's score -- one of his most varied and seductive -- completes the illusion of depth.
But ``The Illusionist" has been constructed for our amusement, and much of the fun comes from watching different acting styles thrown together like cats in a sack. Norton banks his powers to play Eisenheim straight, with sudden shafts of anger and sadness, and if he edges close to self-parody at times, he's still the grounding principle the movie needs. Anyway, you can't take your eyes off him.
Sewell takes the throbbing-vein approach, making the crown prince a capricious monster of pure ham; he's playing to the back seats, bless him. Biel -- whose casting has been a matter of concern to ``7th Heaven" fans -- manages to not
 look like a mall chick in period finery. She's elegantly lovely, in fact, and since her role doesn't require heavy dramatic lifting, she gets off with hardly a singe mark.
As mesmerizing as Norton is, though, the show's stolen by Paul Giamatti, who gets the joke of the movie but never stoops to winking. Chief Inspector Uhl is the one character who holds the story's many strands together, and Giamatti treats the part as -- dare I say it? -- a particularly fine glass of pinot noir. He inhales the bouquet, rolls the overripe dialogue over his tongue, savors the heady undercurrents of butter and fruit. The man stops just short of getting drunk.
Instead, it's we who stagger giddily away from ``The Illusionist," happy to have feasted on more taste than substance.


         Adapted from Steven Millhauser's short story of the same name, "The Illusionist" stars Edward Norton as a magician with supernatural powers, Jessica Biel as a democratically minded duchess, Paul Giamatti as an officious police inspector and Rufus Sewell as the crown prince of something resembling the Austro-Hungarian empire.
 
 Sewell and Giamatti ham it up as the imperious pretender to the throne and his ambitious but conflicted minion in this uncheesy but entertainingly tricky mystery. There's more heat between the two of them than between the sappy lovers — even their mustaches seem to bristle with loving antagonism.
 


         






   The beautiful Sophie von Teschen (Biel) and the prince are about to embark on a marriage of (his) convenience when the moody Eisenheim (Norton) blows back into town, setting up shop in an elegant theater where he makes objects disappear and orange trees grow at 1,000 times their natural rate in front of adoring crowds.
 
 The crown prince is intrigued, then embarrassed, when he fails to unlock the mystery behind Eisenheim's illusions in front of his assembled guests. So he charges Chief Inspector Uhl with the task of digging up something on the shifty upstart with the haughty American attitude toward the monarchy. As it happens, Eisenheim loved Sophie madly as the young, mulleted, fog-enshrouded prole he once was. And she didn't care about the mullet or his laborer father, she loved him too. Naturally, this situation can only end in tears, and Uhl soon finds himself investigating a crime in which none of the empirical evidence is as it seems.
 
 Writer-director Neil Burger doesn't quite display Eisenheim's sleight-of-hand; the effects are silly, and the heavy-handed and anachronistic adaptation seems as if it's brought along the signposts to allegory but then left the point at home. But Giamatti and Sewell tuck into the ham and cheese with such relish you almost expect them to take a bite out of each other, and that is fun to watch.

Edward Norton, who stars, elegantly, as the title conjurer in The Illusionist , is known for the intelligence and intensity he brings to his roles. Norton's vibe is highly analytical, and so penetrating that he can burn a hole through a picture if not properly handled or supported by strong material (it happened most recently in Down in the Valley ). And in that regard, screenwriter-director Neil Burger capitalizes on Norton's strengths quite well.
Based on a short story by Steven Millhauser, The Illusionist  casts Norton as Eisenheim, a lovelorn Viennese stage magician, circa 1900, who confounds Paul Giamatti as a scam-sniffing Viennese police chief with his apparent ability to manipulate time and space while delighting audiences. Well, most audiences: Add Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), proud of his own cold logic, to the small list of those who feel threatened rather than impressed, and thus intent on exposing Eisenheim's scams.  What's real? What's illusion? What's the power of love, the destructiveness of obsession? The Illusionist  looks rigorously styled and measured, and every one of Norton's postures feels chosen. Yet the interesting actor has chosen so thoughtfully that we're riveted. And isn't that a mark of great acting?

 Even the most diehard rationalist, in his heart of hearts, longs to believe in magic. That’s why Neil Burger’s film “The Illusionist,” which tells the story of Eisenheim (Edward Norton), a fictional conjurer who enraptured Viennese audiences in 1900, rouses your slumbering belief in the miraculous.  Onstage, when Eisenheim makes an orange tree sprout from a seed and bear fruit, and a ghost materialize, then fade into vapor, your atavistic inner voice whines, “Please let it be so,” even as your mind struggles to figure out how it was done.  This screen adaptation of Steven Millhauser’s short story, “Eisenheim the Illusionist,” gives Mr. Norton a role that perfectly fits his disturbing inscrutability. His face, with obsidian eyes that take in everything but reflect nothing, and a tight little mouth, is an impenetrable mask of either innocence or cunning; you’re never sure which. Only the corners of his eyes glint like icicles.  Few musical notes are buried in his flat, dry speaking voice, an ideal instrument for conveying an ominous inner deadness. Throughout the movie Eisenheim remains a man of mystery whose few, carefully chosen words project a wary, possibly phony omniscience.  Magic usually doesn’t translate well onto the screen, since the movies themselves are larger-than-life illusions projected through thin air, especially in the age of computer-generated special effects, when every image is susceptible to endless manipulation. But the surreal, spiritualist feats Eisenheim executes, undiluted by obvious cinematographic embellishment, still produce a wow effect on the screen because they have an aesthetic elegance that transcends trickery. Even if they’re fake, they look like works of art.  Storytelling is also a kind of conjuring, and “The Illusionist,” at least until its frantic final moments, is smart enough not to lose its cool and to stay out of the way of the entrancing yarn it spins.  That story has the quality of a supernatural Yiddish folk tale. As a boy, Eisenheim (Aaron Johnson), the son of a carpenter, has a chance encounter with a traveling, sorcerer-like old man, whose wondrous tricks inspire him to  pursue magic.  An intense bond develops between the boy and Sophie von Teschen, the sheltered daughter of aristocrats who disapprove of Eisenheim. The sweethearts carry on a passionate secret friendship until they are discovered together and torn apart.  As they are about to be routed from their hiding place in the woods, Sophie begs him to make the two of them disappear, but his magic fails.  After wandering the world for 15 years, Eisenheim (now played by Mr. Norton) returns to Vienna in command of an astonishing bag of tricks. Sophie (Jessica Biel) is now the fiancée of the ruthless, arrogant Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), who is scheming to become emperor. When he and Sophie attend an Eisenheim performance, she volunteers to be a stage assistant.  The former childhood sweethearts recognize each other, and Eisenheim notices she is still wearing a locket he gave her with his photo in it. Their old bond flares, and soon they begin a clandestine affair.  Also observing the performance is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), the prince’s hand-picked chief of police. Uhl is ordered to uncover the secrets behind Eisenheim’s indecipherable magic after the magician boasts that he can make the prince disappear.    The role of an ambitious policeman from humble roots, who finds himself caught between an irresistible force and an immovable object, is a bracing change of pace for Mr. Giamatti, who invests Uhl with a gravitas that carries whiffs of Orson Welles and Claude Rains.  As Eisenheim delves increasingly into the occult and summons walking, talking ghosts, he attracts a growing cult whose members believe he is a miracle worker and harbinger of a “spiritual republic.” This mystique further infuriates and threatens Leopold, who becomes obsessed with exposing Eisenheim as a fraud.  At a royal command performance, Eisenheim takes the prince’s sword, balances it on its tip on the floor, evokes the myth of Excalibur and invites soldiers in the audience to remove it. The prince succeeds, but only after Eisenheim lifts the spell.  In Mr. Sewell’s fiery performance, the prince is a dashing, scary control freak, who flies into Hitlerian rages when crossed. During one of those tantrums, he commits a murder, the investigation of which proves the ultimate test of Uhl’s character.  If the parallel cat-and-mouse games Eisenheim plays with the prince and policeman have all sorts of political, religious and historical implications, “The Illusionist,” filmed in sepia, prefers to let them lie. This entertaining movie is content to be something a bit more modest: a pungent period folk tale that teases you until the very end.  At that point the film pretends to solve the riddles it has posed. But does it? Or is the ending just a fantasy? Either way, it doesn’t much matter.  “The Illusionist” is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned). It has mild sexual situations and a little strong language.

A bizarre story of intrigue, magic and murder in turn-of-the-century Vienna casts a considerable spell in "The Illusionist." Impeccably crafted second feature from writer-director Neil Burger (2002's "Interview With the Assassin") will be tricky to position commercially, since it will strike some arthouse types as pulpy and conventional, and may prove too aristocratically rarefied for the general modern public. But an enterprising distrib could locate an appreciative audience for the mesmerizing aspects of this classy and well-acted period melodrama.
A bizarre story of intrigue, magic and murder in turn-of-the-century Vienna casts a considerable spell in "The Illusionist." Impeccably crafted second feature from writer-director Neil Burger (2002's "Interview With the Assassin") will be tricky to position commercially, since it will strike some arthouse types as pulpy and conventional, and may prove too aristocratically rarefied for the general modern public. But an enterprising distrib could locate an appreciative audience for the mesmerizing aspects of this classy and well-acted period melodrama.

Adapted from a short story by Steven Millhauser (winner of the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for his novel "Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer"), the yarn centers on a stage magician whose powers are so extraordinary they eventually threaten to subvert the power structure of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Events may require a considerable suspension of disbelief, and some of the tricks could never have been pulled off before a live audience, but the conviction of Burger and his skilled cast, along with the propulsive waves of Philip Glass' score and the trappings of Viennese splendor, circa 1900, provide a persuasive argument in favor of going along for the ride.
A brief prologue shows the celebrated illusionist Eisenheim (Edward Norton) being arrested by Vienna police on stage before an outraged audience, as Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell) inquires if there isn't some charge that can be pinned on him. A brief flashback illustrates the adolescent first love between Eisenheim and the lovely, upper-class Sophie and how, once their relationship was forbidden, the young man left Austria to explore the world.
Fifteen years later, Eisenheim is making his name to the extent that the Crown Prince attends his show in the company of his presumed fiancee, the very same Duchess Sophie von Teschen (Jessica Biel). Leopold offers up Sophie when Eisenheim requests a volunteer from the audience who is not afraid of death.
Asked by the prince what trick he may perform at a subsequent command performance, Eisenheim begins his persistent assault on his royal rival by impudently responding, "Perhaps I'll make you disappear." When the stunt he does perform further insults Leopold, the prince demands the magician's show be shut down.
Caught between the two men is Chief Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti), an urbane fellow who owes his rise to Leopold and must do his bidding. Intrigued as he is by the gifted Eisenheim, he warns the enigmatic performer, whose secrets he repeatedly tries to uncover, how easily disposable both of them are.
But nothing can prevent Eisenheim from reuniting with Sophie, who after a night together informs her lover that Leopold intends to announce their engagement. Eisenheim convinces Sophie to call it off, but Leopold, tragically, isn't the sort to take rejection gracefully.
Pic's second half hinges on the further evolution of Eisenheim into an extraordinary conjurer, one who can make "ghosts" of real people appear and speak onstage. He becomes such a people's hero that he is suspected of fomenting a "spiritual republic," and so bedevils Leopold that the latter assumes a disguise to attend a performance.
Collision of the two men presents the all-too-knowing Uhl with a crisis of conscience that ultimately leads to a resolution both far-fetched and not at all out of line with what the illusionist's powers have led one to accept.
Title character is deliberately presented as remote and unknowable. His powers, and the intellect that enables them, seem superhuman, but he is driven above all by a lost love. Working within these strictures, Norton creates a commanding figure, one who would never attempt anything he thought he couldn't accomplish.
Fastidiously groomed in an unaccustomed period and foreign part, Giamatti is a delight in the Claude Rains role of an epicurean of crime, secrets and social mores. Handily employing a refined English accent where the others lay on a light Austrian veneer, Biel is entirely stunning enough to fight to the death over, and Sewell is credibly arrogant and cruel as the heir apparent. Actors across the board speak in civilized, hushed tones, which furthers the mysterious mood.
Production benefits greatly from the glorious Prague locations that stand in for Vienna, as cinematographer Dick Pope captures them, along with Ondrej Nekvasil's production designs and Ngila Dickson's costumes, with subdued richness.

If, at this remove, we can imagine Vienna  in the late 1890s, we behold a great imperial capital in ferment. Gustav Mahler  is not only reinventing the harmonic structure of serious music, he is getting his head seriously shrunk by Sigmund Freud . Arnold Schoenberg  takes painting lessons from the eroticist Richard Gerstl  (who will later bed the composer's wife), and new schools of thought are quickly multiplying in the coffeehouses. Vienna is the cradle of modernist architecture, psychoanalysis, and twelve-tone music, but it has also given rise to an ominous new strain of anti-Semitism. The Old Order is changing; the catastrophe of World War I appears on the political horizon.
There could be no more apt setting for Neil Burger 's eerie and sumptuous melodrama The Illusionist , in which a gifted stage magician called Eisenheim (played by Edward Norton , who always gives off a vaguely mysterious vibe) does more than perform fancy tricks: He provokes real wonder while embodying the ambiguities and uncertainties of a new century. The film never mentions the likes of Freud or Mahler, but it doesn't have to. Working from a short story by Pulitzer Prize  winner Steven Millhauser , Burger (Interview With the Assassin ) and cinematographer Dick Pope cast a spell, in muted gold and green, over the city (filming was actually based in Prague ), and the ostensibly conventional plot eventually reveals its underlying meditations on the seductions of power and the power of magic. Gotten up with a pointed beard and an accent straight out of Mitteleuropa, Norton is just righta living, breathing enigma. An adventurous score by Philip Glass  enriches the dark mood, as do the admirable contributions of costume designer Ngila Dickson  and production designer Ondrej Nekvasil.
Despite their slightly musty air, the dramatis personae come vividly to life. The son of a cabinetmaker, Edward Ambramovitz  has reinvented himself as Eisenheim, and in his twenties begins to dazzle audiences with grand illusionscausing an orange tree to sprout, full-grown, from a big flowerpot, slowing the flight of falling red balls, returning a borrowed handkerchief to the stage on the wings of two silver butterflies. Are these simply the charms of a gifted con man? Or is Eisenheim tampering with the laws of nature? Those who ask such questions include a beautiful duchess, Sophie von Teschen  (Jessica Biel ), whom Eisenheim has known since childhood; the imperious and severely mustachioed Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell ), who's plotting against his own father as he plots to marry Sophie; and a skeptical police inspector, Uhl (Paul Giamatti ), who serves as our narrator and guide to the proceedings while undergoing a pivotal crisis of conscience himself. By turns witty and tart, Uhl may be the film's most inviting character, even if he's but an amateur magician in his own right.
These resolutely old-fashioned elements might not work at all in a less well-crafted movie. But this entertaining tale of wizardry and lost love vaporizes even our most serious doubts. When the crafty Eisenheim humiliates the strutting prince with an improvised sword-in-the-stone illusion, we are delighted at the sight of arrogance unmasked; when, plunged into grief, Eisenheim spookily summons the restless spirits of the dead to a darkened theater, we are as amazed as his own top-hatted audience, which is quickly growing into a kind of spiritualist cult. We have good cause to scratch our heads. Unaided by computer effects, the tricks we see here are all "real"or as real as magic getsthanks to the oversight of technical consultant Ricky Jay , who is one of the world's most accomplished sleight-of-hand performers and a magic historian of such perfectionist bent that these illusions are all period-accurate to the last detail. When Orson Welles  cut Marlene Dietrich  in half in Follow the Boys , movie audiences likely grinned and winked; when a campy Vincent Price  started killing off famous tricksters in The Mad Magician , schlocky 3-D was the lure. But in the startling moment that Sophie's beautiful ghost materializes from a gray mist in The Illusionist , we can't help musing about supernatural powers. And the nature of the mind. This is Freud's city, after all, fraught with obsession and deep-rooted sexual dynamics.
In the end, Burger and Millhauser provide a "solution" to the film's central mystery that may strike some as prosaic, but that doesn't much compromise the overall effect. Beautifully acted and handsomely mounted, this gorgeous period piece is an intelligent and intriguing exploration of "the dark arts"less dependent on mere hocus-pocus than on the convincing journey of the soul undertaken by its hero.
