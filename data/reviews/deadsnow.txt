In Dead Snow , a group of Norwegian medical students  pals on an Easter vacation  bunk together in a mountain cabin, ready for fun involving skiing, beer drinking, and sex. What they get is an invasion of WWII-era Nazi zombies who haunt the hills. (The undead bastards are gluttons for dining on guts.) Cheery, silly, splattery, and respectful of its elders (and betters, particularly Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead ), this bloody/cheesy subtitled Scandinavian lark is written and directed  by Tommy Wirkola, who has a nice touch with severed limbs. (Also available, dubbed in English, on cable via on demand )

 Chomp-chomp, zip-zip go the Nazi zombies in “Dead Snow,” a self-consciously outlandish horror flick about an army of restless and neatly uniformed undead haunting some woods in contemporary Norway. Set in a remote winter wonderland, presumably to accentuate the vivid contrast between all the dazzling white snow and the copious splashes and splatters of red (screams also sound louder in muffled silence), the story involves a group of disposable medical students whose vacation turns into a generic gorefest.  As a director, Tommy Wirkola, who wrote the irrelevant screenplay with Stig Frode Henriksen, doesn’t just hit every horror beat; he pounds it to an indistinguishable pulp. An adherent of the relatively new fast-zombie trend, he makes his undead work, or at least run hard, for their supper. The nonzombies, meanwhile, who behave as if they knew that they were being prepared for slaughter, jokingly referring to  films like “The Evil Dead,” are such imbeciles that you look forward to their pounding (and chomping). As is often the case with movies of this type, the real stars are the special-effects team, which does some admirably disgusting work with ribbons of intestines and a brain that plops out of a ripped-open skull with surprising delicacy.

After hitting paydirt with the masked slasher thrills of "Cold Prey" and its sequel, Norwegian cinema mines the genre's No. 2 unstoppable killing machine via "Dead Snow." Zombie flick starts out in competent but routine fashion before the cheerfully blood-soaked later reels turn raucously tongue-in-cheek. IFC pickup is unlikely to reap more than modest theatrical rewards here, but should do well as a DVD/broadcast item in numerous territories.
After the requisite prologue showing one victim's desperate attempt to escape something in the woods, we're introduced to seven med students traveling to a friend's remote cabin. Little do they know she's already toast, having made the unfortunate decision to hike in alone. A weird older man (Bjorn Sundquist) warns them vaguely of an "evil presence" related to long-ago brutal Nazi occupiers. Turns out the latter are still lurking about, albeit undead and ready for dinner. Full-bore panic sets in around the 40-minute mark; a bit later, the pic reveals itself as a horror-action-comedy a la "Evil Dead," with amusing twists of fate and over-the-top gore. Pro package makes full use of the frozen but still picturesque countryside.

Dude, that's not a regular zombie biting your neck, it's a Nazi  zombie! Which means that the flesh-eaters in Dead Snow  are better dressed than your typical George Romero  undead, and a lot more relentless. The unlucky travelers crossing paths with these swine are a modern-day group of medical students vacationing in the Norwegian Alps. A local tells them that, during World War II, a platoon of German soldiers was driven by the nearby townspeople into the mountains, never to be seen again. "There's an evil presence here," he warns, but, of course, the arrogant youths don't listen. For more than half of this 90-minute film, director Tommy Wirkola  plays things pretty straight—a mistake, perhaps, since the first half is pretty boring—but once the Nazi zombies start arriving en masse, he abruptly shifts to an Evil Dead –style zaniness, including the sight of a potential victim hanging off the side of a mountain while using a zombie's entrails as rope. Let's call this the gooiest movie of the year (so far).
