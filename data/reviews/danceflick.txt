If you thought the world couldn't get enough of bad spoof movies, you thought wrong.
The Wayans brothers once again are bringing back these comedies with their latest gem, "Dance Flick." In a movie that offers everything but real dancing, new faces Damon Wayans Jr., Shoshana Bush, and Essence Atkins battle with rivals using dance moves that deliver low-blow jokes and cheap laughs. From a break dancing newborn to men dressed up in leotards, you definitely get what you asked for when you watch director Damien Wayans's new movie.
The film pokes fun at old teen movies like "Step-Up," "Hairspray" and "Flash Dance," putting "Dance Flick" on the same shelf as its forgotten satire counterparts; "Not Another Teen Movie," "Epic Movie" and "Scary Movie."
In a spoof twist of 2001's "Save the Last Dance," a young street dancer, Thomas Uncles (Wayans Jr.) takes the new girl in town, Megan White (Bush), under his wing as his dance pupil and tries to help her achieve her lost dreams of being accepted into Juilliard. After many obstacles standing in Megan's way (freak accidents, overweight gangsters, and her lack of rhythm), she eventually finds herself dancing with her spunky loudmouthed sidekick, Charity (Atkins), and Thomas in the mother of all dance battles between the two rival dance groups in the city.
Throughout "Dance Flick," scenes quickly turn into a Wayans family reunion as writers Shawn, Marlon, and Keenan Wayans pass the comedy torch to their nephew, Damon. The brothers also make their cameos, play ridiculous characters, and appear in multiple flashbacks that don't even get a chuckle. The film promises mind-numbing one-liners, crude humor, and dumb moments that you can't help but laugh at because they are unbelievably horrible.

In this enjoyably dirty-minded sendup of when-ballet-met-hip-hop youth musicals, the Wayans brothers hand the directorial reigns over to their nephew, Damien Dante Wayans, who piles on the stupid/smart gags with just the right what-the-hell abandon. The film riffs on Save the Last Dance , Hairspray , and High School Musical 3 , but what's funniest is its dissection of message-movie piety. In Dance Flick , racial and sexual differences aren't transcended  they're super-sized. As a rotund hoodlum, David Alan Grier does the ultimate break dance from hell.

 The spectacle of David Alan Grier break-dancing in a fat suit is one of half a dozen uproarious scenes in “Dance Flick,” the Wayans family’s explosively funny spoof. Bouncing on the dance floor like a lead balloon, this heaving blob of a character, known as Sugar Bear, opens a gaping fissure with each collision and ends up squashing a bystander flatter than a pancake.  A loan shark and drug lord with a cuddly name, Sugar Bear spends his days stuffing his face with Krispy Kreme doughnuts and pumpkin pie, a package of sugar by his side. Mr. Grier ultimately steals the movie with a tour-de-force parody of “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going,” from “Dreamgirls,”  in which “You’re gonna love me” becomes “You’re gonna feed me.”  In a Zac Efron caricature that’s almost as funny, the decidedly un-macho son (Brennan Hillard) of the basketball coach at Music High School, where much of the movie takes place, flounces happily into the street, trailed by admiring fellow students as he crows a version of “Fame” whose title exclamation has been changed to “Gay!”  Between production numbers, “Dance Flick,” directed by Damien Dante Wayans from a screenplay he wrote with four other members of the Wayans clan (Keenen Ivory, Shawn, Marlon and Craig), pieces together a ridiculous generic story. Like every other Wayans family farce, it has a 10-second attention span.  In the early scenes the plans of its heroine, Megan (Shoshana Bush), a ferociously ambitious ballet hopeful, are interrupted by a car crash that kills her mother on the way to a Juilliard audition. Even this tragedy (which is later re-enacted as a comic ballet) is played for laughs, as rescue workers ignore the mother trapped under the vehicle and greedily scoop up leaking gasoline.  “Dance Flick” offers a nonstop barrage of jokes and quotations from movies and television that are all the funnier if you know the sources, although familiarity is not required. Besides “Dreamgirls” and “High School Musical,” references include “Flashdance,” “Step Up,” “Save the Last Dance,” “You Got Served,” “Stomp the Yard,” “Black Snake Moan,” “Twilight,” “Hairspray” and Heather Mills in “Dancing With the Stars.”  The Wayans style, established in the first two “Scary Movies,” relies on the density of jokes that push the acceptable bounds of taste to keep the comedy aloft. A free-for-all of  gross-out humor, “Dance Flick” lets racial and sexual jokes fly. Amy Sedaris is especially funny as the school’s tart-tongued dance teacher, who has a prominent anatomical abnormality. The drama teacher, Mr. Moody (Marlon Wayans), teaches his male acting students to react by punching them hard in the face or kissing them full on the mouth.  Megan auditions for Juilliard, writhing to Rick James’s “Super Freak,” which is not exactly what the judges had expected. She eventually lands in Music High School, where she is befriended by Charity (Essence Atkins), a single mother who blithely stashes her infant in her locker during school hours. The child’s father, Baby Daddy (Shawn Wayans), appears now and then and generously provides a snapshot of himself so his son can see his face every morning. Megan begins a fraught romance with Charity’s brother, Thomas (Damon Wayans Jr.), a leader of a dance crew that is in debt to the villainous Sugar Bear.  The cramming together of so much potentially offensive humor has a reverse effect. In a watchdog culture where candid remarks and clothing choices are continually weighed on the Internet as to whether so-and-so or such-and-such is going too far, “Dance Flick” exhales the rank humidity accumulated in a climate of obsessive caution. Its belly laughs leave you feeling liberated and not guilty; I repeat, not guilty.  “Dance Flick” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). For all its off-color humor, it is very careful to stay within limits. (A parody of “Dirty Dancing” was scrapped for being too dirty.

In perhaps the surest sign the teen hot-to-trot pic is played out, the Wayans brothers' "Dance Flick" takes on such easy targets as "High School Musical" and "Step Up," films that don't take themselves seriously enough to suffer from such mockery in the first place. This slapstick and scatological spoof settles for obvious punchlines, delivering just enough laughs to justify its existence without coming anywhere near the bar set by "Scary Movie." The clumsy result is what the teen target aud might call a "dance fail," with lower returns in store than either dance films or Wayans pics typically enjoy.
As the five credited Wayans writers are clever enough to recognize, the dance subgenre is Hollywood's favorite place to endorse cross-cultural romances, a trend that's ripe for the family's black-centric sense of humor. From the Jets vs. Sharks-style pairing of "Save the Last Dance" to the colorblind multicultural ensembles featured in Disney fare, such pics love to mix and match characters from every side of the tracks: black and white, rich and poor, classical ballet and street dancers.
"Dance Flick" uses them all at once, pairing a brokenhearted Juilliard reject (Shoshana Bush) and a thuggish gangbanger (the thoroughly nonthreatening Damon Wayans Jr.) and watching their worlds collide. As in "Save the Last Dance," the lead loses her mom en route to her big audition, only this time, the tragedy is played for laughs. Meanwhile, her beau must win back $5,000 in a dance-off or face the wrath of super-size drug lord Sugar Bear (a fatsuit-clad David Alan Grier).
Throw in a tubby Tracy Turnblad type (Chelsea Makela), a Zac Efron-esque closet case (Brennan Hillard) and an obligatory black best friend (Essence Atkins), and you've got your dance-movie cliches covered. Since that alone can't get "Dance Flick" to its 75-minute mark (not counting eight minutes of end credits), the Wayans throw in references to such recent pics as "Dreamgirls," "Ray" and "Black Snake Moan" ("Twilight" even warrants its own epilogue).
What the Wayans fail to do is deliver those scant pleasures the dance-movie genre offers -- namely, great music, swoon-worthy romantic leads (a Channing Tatum or Rob Pattinson impersonation is a poor substitute for the real deal) and off-the-hook dance montages -- leaving only the raunchiest gags unspoiled by the trailer (best of these is Amy Sedaris' turn as dance instructor Ms. Cameltoe, pronounced "Camel-tois," whose too-tight leotard pushes the limits of the pic's PG-13 rating).
Parodying the dance itself is a tricky prospect, since the best hip-hop dancers are frequently funny in their own right, challenging one another in an escalating battle of insult and one-upsmanship. Helmer Damien Dante Wayans doesn't really have an excuse for cutting that corner, since he enlisted Dave Scott, the same choreographer who devised the power showdowns in half the movies he's spoofing.
High points include a young female breakdancer determined not to let her pregnant tummy cramp her style, and the "Flame" number, which rewrites the lyrics of "Fame" as a coming-out anthem.
Production values are fine, though the Wayans still haven't found the right partner to solve their considerable CG and prosthetics demands -- the pic's beatboxing cameltoe notwithstanding.
