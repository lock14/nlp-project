An archetypal date movie with a good heart, Catch and Release
 is the feature debut of screenwriter Grant (Ever After
, Erin Brockovich)
, and as far as romantic comedies go, you could do far worse. That said, this story of Gray (Garner), a young woman widowed on her wedding day who discovers her husband-to-be's shadow life with both the assistance and discouragement of his tightly knit group of friends (among them filmmaker Kevin Smith), is pretty lightweight. The messages the film sends � that you never really know everything about even those closest in your life and that out of grief can come joy or something like it � are mixed, but the performances, particularly Garner's, which necessitates her vacillating between sorrow, pity, lust, and love like some sort of emotional pinball, are well done. After the death of her one true love, while sorting through her almost-husband's records, she finds a series of $3,000 monthly payments to an unknown person in a far away place. It doesn't take much to figure out what those mystery checks might be, but Grant uses them to introduce another pair of characters into an already semicrowded storyline: Lewis as the ditsy single mom of Gray's heretofore unknown step-child and Friesen as the boy. And then there's Fritz, fresh in from L.A. and busily banging a wedding/wake pickup in the bathroom while a grief-stricken Gray cowers in the shower. Introduced as a bad boy, his character arc warps all out of proportion to what we know of him; in the end it serves the story but not the film. Kevin Smith, playing, I think, Kevin Smith (not a bad thing), gets most of the big yuks, and there are more than you'd expect. Awash in good vibes (the film was shot in Boulder, Colo., our national, if unofficial, city of good vibes), this is the sort of film that used to be called "indie" back when the term actually meant something. Now it's just another romantic comedy, neither terribly bad nor truly great, buoyed along on currents of hope and post-traumatic good cheer.


Not to put too fine a point on it, but "Catch and Release" is the chick-flick version of guy-cry movies like "Garden State " and "The Last Kiss. " Like them, it features underdrawn yet quirky characters onto which a youthful audience can project its anxieties. Like them, it uses an iPod playlist in place of story structure, and like them it knows there are no easy answers but gives them to us anyway. The film's a pleasant enough daydream before it turns all squoodgy at the end.
Jennifer Garner, oddly coming off as a bit of a roadshow Julia Roberts, plays Gray Wheeler, a Boulder, Colo., woman whose wedding plans turn funereal when her fiance is killed during a bachelor party boating accident. We never see him -- the movie's about her road back to the land of the living -- and it's just as well, since the more of his secrets we learn the more Gray and we want to give him a sharp kick.
"Catch and Release" focuses mostly on her friendships with his surviving circle of buddies. There are three of them: Dopey, Grumpy, and Hunky, played respectively by Kevin Smith (the director of "Clerks" in a rare acting-only role), Sam Jaeger , and Timothy Olyphant ("Deadwood"), whose constant three-day stubble is a miracle fashioned by God himself.
Dopey and Grumpy -- their names are Sam and Dennis, really -- live together, and I spent most of the movie assuming they were a couple, especially given Smith's penchant for muumuu -size bathrobes. They're just roommates, though, despite the marital squabbling; all three men burn a torch for the grieving near-widow, and when Gray moves in with the boys, tiptoeing around those emotions becomes deafening.
As written and directed by Susannah Grant, the writer of "Erin Brockovich " and, more pertinently, "Ever After" and "In Her Shoes," "Catch and Release" wears its heart on its peasant-blouse sleeve, and it has a fondness toward most of its characters that other movies would do well to emulate. Grant knows life can be an unholy mess, and she's attentive to that mess until she just can't help grabbing a dustpan and start cleaning up.
In the process, Gray thaws from a perfectionist wife-in - waiting to a sloppier, happier, better human being. So we're led to believe, anyway, but "Catch and Release" never convinces us there was a real person there to begin with. Gray has no parents, no female friends, a vague job at a desk somewhere but no career -- she's an outline Grant hasn't bothered to fill in. Garner gives her a lik able personality but little depth or force of character. She's all elegant, elongated lines, like a beautiful and slightly puzzled Afghan hound.
The male roles are marginally richer; certainly they're funnier. Smith tries to carve out a new niche for himself as a wacky best friend and comes fairly close. Smith's character, Sam, works for Celestial Seasonings, where he comes up with literary quotes for boxes of tea. Even his suicide attempts are cute. Olyphant, in the not-so-bad-boy role, twinkles charmingly until all of a sudden, and through no real fault of his own, it stops being charming.
There's a funkier and more interesting movie in Maureen, a character played by Juliette Lewis. Maureen is a single mom, a massage therapist, and a dimwit California follower of every new-age theory out there. She's a nasal, needy wreck, and "Catch and Release" is torn between adoring her and making ruthless fun of her.
Ultimately, the movie's a romantic melodrama in the vein of a 1930s women's picture or a 1950 s true-love comedy. Not that there's anything wrong with that, although both those forms had a pulpy conviction "Catch and Release" is too timid to embrace. The film is as sensitive and unchallenging as its strumalong soundtrack, the soft-focus playlist of Gray's life. I'd be more interested in hearing Maureen's playlist, but it probably wouldn't sell as many CDs.

         Neither a comedy nor a drama but existing in that comfortable space in between, "Catch and Release," the feature-directing debut of screenwriter Susannah Grant ("Erin Brockovich," "In Her Shoes"), is an oddly appealing, if innocuous, movie of considerable charm.
 
  In a part that might have been played by Julia Roberts five years ago, Jennifer Garner stars as Gray Wheeler, a young Boulder, Colo., woman whose fiancé, Grady, dies just before their wedding. She deals with her grief by moving in with Grady's two amicably contrarian roommates, Sam and Dennis, gets further pummeled when Grady turns out to have had some significant secrets and eventually finds love in an unexpected place.
 


         






    Critically speaking, there's a lot about the movie that doesn't work. It's sentimental, the plot is contrived, the fishing metaphor overreaches and the characters exist in that hermetically sealed fantasy world of movies in which jobs are an afterthought and slacker time is plentiful. Yet the fantasy part may be a big component of the movie's allure.
 
  In the movie, people have time to talk and sort things out. They go for walks. They ride bikes. They drink coffee and spend time in the kitchen together preparing food. There's a warmth and familiarity to the relationships that is very consoling. In its better scenes, "Catch and Release" is reminiscent of the TV series "thirtysomething."
 
  Grant creates emotionally complex characters who are fun to spend time with. Gray, Dennis and Sam make a steadfast trio who find solace in their mutual sorrow. However, their shared equilibrium — rooted in Gray's dourness, Dennis' stolid predictability and Sam's sarcasm — is thrown off by the presence of Fritz (Timothy Olyphant), a childhood friend of Grady's now living in California and working as a commercial director. He sticks around after the funeral but he rubs Gray the wrong way.
 
  In the tradition of classic romantic comedies, that initial dislike soon turns to mutual attraction. The development of this relationship isn't quite credible, but once Gray figures out that there's more to Fritz than his casual good looks, and he's not the cad she had imagined, the chemistry between Garner and Olyphant infuses their trysting with the giddiness of the forbidden.
 
  Kevin Smith nearly walks off with the movie as Sam, displaying a surprising range and earning most of the movie's biggest laughs. Sam Jaeger makes a less indelible impression as Dennis, the dependable friend, but you have to like a guy who builds a peace garden as a memorial to a buddy.
 
  A major subplot involving one of Grady's undisclosed secrets brings Juliette Lewis into the picture as a massage therapist from Encino. As good as Lewis is at this type of ditsy but wise neo-hippy, the character is a tired stereotype. It also seems odd that her New Agey obsession with health would be greeted with such cynicism by residents of a college town such as Boulder. And her preparation of a bland tempeh loaf and bean paste is a standard Hollywoodism that seems outdated by 30 years.
 
  "Catch and Release's" virtues outweigh its flaws, though, and its characters provide two hours of pleasant entertainment. More than enough time to acquiesce and give in to the overly symmetrical ending.
 
  Adding to the movie's agreeable nature is a buoyant soundtrack of adult alternative pop featuring Gomez, Paul Westerberg, Death Cab for Cutie and the Doves.
 
  The film's bucolic setting in Boulder, and surrounding areas (partly filmed in British Columbia), is so refreshingly tranquil, you'll be tempted to pack up the mountain bike and head for the Rockies.
 

 
  "Catch & Release." MPAA rating: PG-13 for sexual content, language and some drug use. Running time: 1 hour, 51 minutes. In general release.   

Catch and Release  tells of Gray Wheeler (Jennifer Garner), a young woman  whose fiancé dies right before their marriage. In fact, the neat, unspecified demise-by-manly-accident, with its luxurious romantic pathos, is announced in Gray's voice-over in the first scene, a wedding that turns into a funeral. Of course, such a setup itself doesn't necessarily have to skew chick-y. Given the movie's androgynous, fishing-oriented title and the heroine's androgynous, freshwater species of a name, the story could theoretically develop into a muscular drama about a competitive fly-casting tournament hosted by his buddies in the dead man's memory, during which the grieving almost-bride honors her late beloved by gutting trout on a riverbank. Voilà, a real guys' pic!
But skew chick-y it does. I just don't know any chick who will make sense of this flick  it's that blitheringly out of touch with present psychosexual (never mind feminist) time and space. And it's not enough to blame the movie's happy, shiny, blue-skies Boulder, Colo., setting for the thin atmosphere. As writer Susannah Grant (In Her Shoes , Erin Brockovich ) lays it out in her feature-directing debut, Gray deals with her grief by moving into a funky Boulder cottage with her late beloved's best friends. She learns some surprising and dismaying things about the man she thought she knew. (The non-plot-spoiling news is that he was secretly rich, and highbred enough to have a mother played by the commanding Irish stage star Fiona Shaw, Harry Potter 's Aunt Petunia Dursley herself.) And then Gray finds new romantic happiness. I won't say who the unlikely candidate is except to point out that the movie also stars Deadwood 's Timothy Olyphant as Fritz, a slick, babe-getting, Malibu-lifestyle-loving friend of the deceased's who becomes less interestingly oily and more dully ''suitable'' the longer he's around Gray's deep dimples.
With so much meaningless romantic-comedy seaweed caught in Catch and Release 's narrative net, it's useless to sift through for clarity. Gray's new, love-'em-like-brothers roommates include one perfectly decent type (TV-weight cute guy Sam Jaeger) who's pined for her for years, and one perfectly slackery, infantile, Silent Bob-ish layabout (Silent Bob himself, Kevin Smith) who drinks too much, eats too much, and sounds exactly like Kevin Smith. Why does a grieving adult woman move in with such lost boys? Why is Fritz so slippery an eel? Who is this curiously uninquisitive Gray, anyway, who knew so little of the man she was ready to marry after being with him so many years? And Kevin Smith? Really??
I'd also ask what Juliette Lewis was doing playing a trampy thing pitched somewhere  between a small-town floozy and a New Age kook except that it's a shame to look a gift ditz in the mouth. Lewis' characteristically piquant participation may be all wrong for the picture. But at least her girl's not a dead fish like Gray.

 The Chamber of Commerce of Boulder, Colo., should be over the moon about the portrait of that city presented by the warm and fuzzy romantic comedy “Catch and Release.” It appears to be a clean, prosperous bohemian paradise where everyone is happy 90 percent of the time; even visitors from big, bad Los Angeles quickly mellow.  There is great fly-fishing nearby (the title refers to that sport), and the scenery is to die for. The movie is so conscious of being on a Rocky Mountain high that one character remarks suspiciously that people in Boulder seem “unnaturally” happy.  Even when Sam (Kevin Smith), the only overweight person in sight, makes a halfhearted suicide attempt with pills and vodka, he’s in and out of the hospital in a jiffy, and no one gives his gesture a second thought. His attack of the blues has two possible causes: his weight and the fact that one of his best friends, Grady, whose funeral opens the film, has just died in an accident.  The first feature film directed by Susannah Grant, the screenwriter of “Charlotte’s Web,” “Erin Brockovich” and “In Her Shoes,” “Catch and Release” is a star vehicle for Jennifer Garner, who plays Grady’s nervous but plucky fiancée, Gray Wheeler, left stunned by his death on the eve of their wedding.  At least Gray has no dearth of comforters: her fiancé’s three best friends are all at the ready. Besides Sam, they include two dreamboats: Sam’s roommate Dennis (Sam Jaeger), who is secretly in love with her, and Fritz (Timothy Olyphant), a playboy director of television commercials who flies into Boulder for the funeral from his spacious Malibu beach house.  The moment Mr. Olyphant (lately of “Deadwood”) smolders into view, you know that he and Gray are predestined to be lovers; the only question is how soon. They get off on the wrong foot at the funeral reception when Gray overhears Fritz having quickie sex with a curvaceous caterer. Although Gray is miffed, that doesn’t stop the two from coupling in near-record time. Once their chemistry is sealed with an impulsive kiss instigated by Gray, they begin carrying on a secret affair.  Their rapprochement is hastened by Gray’s discovery that Grady had a million-dollar fortune of which she knew nothing, and out of which he was dispensing $3,000 a month to a massage therapist in Santa Monica. When she confronts Fritz with this news, he tells her that the woman in California has a 7-year-old son. Gray is doubly taken aback when the other woman, Maureen (Juliette Lewis), and her child turn up in Boulder, and the boy (Joshua Friesen) is actually 3 1/2.  At this point you are prepared for hair-pulling fireworks between the good girl and the designated floozy. But Maureen turns out to be a warm-hearted if flaky devotee of Chinese herbs and holistic cuisine, as well as a caring mother. Before long, everybody is getting along famously.  “Catch and Release” is refreshing for what it doesn’t have. There is no whiny princess-mongering, with a spoiled golden girl put on a throne and crowned amid oohs and ahs, while diamonds and dollars rain from on high. There is no baring of claws, and the words bitch and slut are never spoken by these nice people. The closest thing to a mean girl is Grady’s stern, grieving mother (Fiona Shaw), who pressures Gray to give back her engagement ring.  Ms. Garner and Mr. Olyphant could pass as younger siblings of Julia Roberts and Johnny Depp, and you get the sense that the movie is a test of their romantic star magnetism. If Ms. Garner blends spunk and eternal girlishness in about the same proportion as Ms. Roberts, her screen wattage is about 40 to Ms. Roberts’s 100.  Mr. Olyphant’s Fritz, meanwhile, oozes a slightly snaky sincerity. As much as the movie strains to make him Mr. Right, it leaves you with nagging doubts about his character; his grins are too wide, and he casts too many sidelong glances to be trusted.  Although I find the term “chick flick” odious, I imagine that Columbia Pictures regards “Catch and Release” as exactly that, although there are signs that Ms. Grant was reaching for something more layered and subtle than the usual fairy-tale formula. If the compromise between one thing and another leaves the movie struggling for basic credibility, its affection for its characters doesn’t feel cynical.  “Catch and Release” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations.

Neither as bad as its early buzz and January berth would suggest nor as good as it should have been, "Catch and Release" is a so-so romantic dramedy about a woman (Jennifer Garner) finding love in the wake of her fiance's accidental death. True to its name, largely forgettable item should register as a brief theatrical catch --playing to limited, femme-driven B.O. -- before its hastened release on DVD racks.
The helming debut of scribe Susannah Grant ("Erin Brockovich"), who also penned it, "Catch and Release" was originally slated for an April 2006 release. But Sony, seeking to lighten its marketing load (Daily Variety
, Jan. 12, 2006), opted for a nine-month postponement.
Yet despite the negative implications of its delay, "Catch and Release" isn't wholly irredeemable. Garner is characteristically engaging as Gray Wheeler, the Boulder, Colo.-based bride whose wedding turns into a funeral when her b.f. Grady perishes during a pre-marital boating accident (alluded to only obliquely).
A maudlin intro sequence at the reception sets up key characters including the devastated Gray, Grady's weepy mother (Fiona Shaw), and the would-be groomsmen: buffoonish Sam (Kevin Smith channeling Jack Black), sincere Dennis (Sam Jaeger) and the rakish Fritz ("Deadwood's" Timothy Olyphant), who deals with his grief by seducing the caterer.
Unable to afford the house she and Grady had rented, Gray moves in with Sam and Dennis, who are also lodging Fritz. While this plot point accelerates the story, it begs the question: Why doesn't Gray have girlfriends or family of her own? It's inconceivable that a woman would undergo such a catastrophic loss without so much as a call from her mother, let alone her bridesmaids.
Once ensconced with the guys, Gray bonds with Sam and Dennis, each of whom manifests his grief differently: the former gorging himself on food and vodka, the latter throwing himself into the construction of a memorial "Peace Garden." Though Gray initially loathes the self-centered playboy Fritz (having overheard his tryst with the caterer) surprising events -- and his hitherto untapped sensitivity -- will bring them together.
It's giving little away to say that Gray discovers Grady had a secret bank account from which he made regular payments to a California massage therapist named Maureen (Juliette Lewis), who had borne his son (Joshua Friesen). Stung by that revelation (and by Maureen's description of her as "perfect"), Gray resolves to be a little more edgy. She begins a clandestine affair with Fritz that blossoms into something unexpected. And she overcomes her resistance to the ditsy Maureen and her oh-so precious son.
One of the troubles with "Catch and Release" is that it deals with serious issues -- sudden death, grief, infidelity, deception -- in a fairly lighthearted way. What makes that worse is that there are a few moments when the film actually approaches some kind of emotional or dramatic truth. Olyphant and Garner generate real sparks, and their should-we-or-shouldn't-we attraction feels authentic.
Ditto the Sam-Dennis friendship in which men unable to articulate their emotions resort to shows of physical strength. Alternatively, several running gags grow tedious.
If "Catch and Release" was a complete loss, its flaws wouldn't be as glaring. Grant can write and shows promise as a director, but she's not served by her material or its serio-comic tone here.
There's no problem with her cast, however, although Lewis could have taken her ditsy persona down a notch; she's like the choral voice that threatens to drown out the others. Garner won't lose any fans, and Olyphant clearly has a bright future.
Tech elements are fine across the board. There's a hip soundtrack including songs from the Lemonheads and Foo Fighters, but it sometimes feels like the songs are turned up when the story starts to falter.
