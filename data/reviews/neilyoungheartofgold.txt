         "Neil Young: Heart of Gold" is a concert film and something more. It's the record of a life, a musical and spiritual autobiography, and as directed by Jonathan Demme it taps into the kind of unashamed, unsentimental emotion that's become increasingly rare in films of any kind.
 
  "Heart of Gold's" success comes from the combination of two talents ideally suited to one another: Young, who reaffirms his position as a master singer-songwriter, and Demme, who, as he did with the Talking Heads' very different "Stop Making Sense," shows no one is better at putting music on screen.
 


         






    Though these two had worked together before, on music videos and an Oscar-nominated song Young wrote for Demme's "Philadelphia," their collaboration here was special.
 
  For one thing, the "Prairie Wind" collection of songs that are the heart of the film came from an unusual circumstance: Young wrote them in the spring of 2005 out of a need to re-examine his life after being diagnosed with a potentially fatal brain aneurysm.
 
  These compositions, suffused with Young's gift for making poetry out of everyday life, touch everything from his wistfulness at being an empty-nest parent ("Here for You") to a wrenching lyric about the recent death of his father: "Trying to remember what my daddy said / Before too much time took away his head."
 
  Making the material that much more emotional was the fact that the filmed concert took place over two nights last August at Nashville's storied Ryman Auditorium, for decades the home of the Grand Ole Opry. "Neil would be singing these songs for the first time ever to an audience that never heard them before," Demme explained at the film's Sundance premiere. "He'd be so communicative under those circumstances."
 
  It isn't just these brand new songs that Young sings to great effect, the emotion of the concert extends to his proven classics as well. "It's a Dream," "I Am a Child," "Harvest Moon" and the title song "Heart of Gold" are played with great warmth and skill by a band that includes pedal steel virtuoso Ben Keith, bass player Rick Rosas, keyboardist Spooner Oldham and backup singers that include Emmylou Harris, Young's wife, Pegi, and the Fisk University Jubilee Singers.
 
  "Heart of Gold" starts with snippets of interviews, shot by Demme himself, of some of Young's bandmates, emphasizing how far back many of them go with the singer and how much a sense of family matters to him in the people he plays with. Demme has said he visualized this film as a country music dream playing in Young's head, and it has taken special care both with its painted backdrop and with costumes designed by music couturier Manuel.
 
  The costumes, however, are all simple ones, for "Heart of Gold" allows nothing to get in the way of the music. Demme and master cinematographer Ellen Kuras set up eight cameras around the room plus an onstage Steadicam and took a classic approach to filming Young concentrating on capturing the magic of the music and the personal interplay among the musicians.
 
  There are no reaction shots from the crowd, no shots outside the Ryman once the music has begun. What we get instead, aided by veteran New York editor Andy Keir, is an immersion in the onstage experience. "Heart of Gold" has a wonderful naturalness to it, the ability to unfold as if every angle, every shot, every reaction puts us just where we want to be at every moment.
 
  Even in a film like this, some songs have an especially strong charge: Young singing and relating the story behind "Old Man," playing something on Hank Williams' old guitar, talking about how overwhelmed he was the first time he heard Ian Tyson's "Four Strong Winds" and his closing the show with an unforgettable "One of These Days."
 
  What "Heart of Gold" also reveals, almost without intending to, is what a quintessentially private person Young is, unaffected by and even mistrustful of fame.
 
  We hear him before the concert, preparing to "let the muse have us, take a shot, send it out." We see him on stage after it's over, in a beautiful closing credits sequence, playing "The Old Laughing Lady" to an empty house. If there isn't a tear in your eye during some of the moments in between, don't tell me.
 
 "Neil Young: Heart of Gold"
 
 MPAA rating:
 PG for some drug-related lyrics   

It requires a stretch of the memory muscles to recall when a concert movie could be an event, but occasionally you see one that bubbles to life. Neil Young: Heart of Gold  is the first major rock-star performance film directed by Jonathan Demme since Stop Making Sense  (1984), and though it's wistful, elegiac, and touching where the earlier movie vibrated with the electricity of Talking Heads at their headiest, Demme hasn't lost a bit of his ability to slow-zoom the camera right into a musician's soul. In 2005, Young and his band took over Nashville's fabled Ryman Auditorium to perform the Prairie Wind  album, and Young, wizened yet valiant, his voice still braying at the moon, delivers these songs of aging and loss as if caught in a beautiful dream of what lies waiting for him on the other side.

   WHEN the curtain opens, Neil Young is standing onstage,   his face full of years. Dressed in a gray western suit, with a plainsman's hat and a well-used acoustic guitar, he looks like an old-time cowboy crooner, but somehow scruffier. The hair curling over his collar seems greasy and the way he ducks his head you might think he hadn't spent much time indoors; he probably needs to knock the dust off his boots before he enters the parlor. It's a fanciful fiction, this gent with the hat, the suit and the aw-shucks reserve, and part of the beautiful story Jonathan Demme tells in his concert film "Neil Young: Heart of Gold."  Mr. Demme shot the film over the course of  two concerts recorded on Aug. 18 and 19 in Nashville's storied Ryman Auditorium, original home of the Grand Ole Opry. The first half of the film includes 9 of the 10 songs from Mr. Young's most recent album, "Prairie Wind" (Mr. Demme saved one song for the DVD); the second features 10 titles from his songbook, a number of which were first recorded in Nashville. Although this part of the film — this set, really — begins with "I Am a Child," which he recorded with his former band Buffalo Springfield, many of the other titles in this section — "Old Man,"  "Old King" and "The Old Laughing Lady" — suggest that Mr. Young, who turned 60 in November, is in a  ruminative state of mind.  The film provides no real back story about the production, but in interviews Mr. Young has said that the idea for it arose out of a phone conversation he had with Mr. Demme. The director, who made the Talking Heads concert film "Stop Making Sense," explained that he had a year off (nice work if you can get it) and asked Mr. Young what he was up to. As it happens, the musician had just finished "Prairie Wind," which he had begun recording right after discovering that he had to undergo surgery for a brain aneurysm. He cut some of the songs in Nashville, had the surgery (twice) and then finished the recording. Released in September, the album was nominated for a Grammy for rock album of the year. (It lost.)  That "Neil Young: Heart of Gold" opens in theaters just two days after the Grammys gives the documentary a whiff of promotion, but it is also of a piece with a life's work that has included four films (directed by Mr. Young under the pseudonym Bernard Shakey) and such self-institutionalizing artifacts as an authorized if legally troubled biography, "Shakey," and music anthologies like "Decade" and the long-awaited, still-awaited "Neil Young Archives." Brushing up against death as Mr. Young did last year would be reason enough to undertake a concert film like this; but the songs are justification enough. Filled with country memories, bluesy regret, familiar and piercing sentiment, the new album sounds like quintessential Neil Young, which, depending on your home catalog, will be either an enormous turn-on or turn-off.  Those who welcome each of his new albums will probably feel as generously disposed toward the film. Like the album, which features some of Mr. Young's memorable colleagues — the steel guitarist Ben Keith, the bass guitarist Rick Rosas and Emmylou Harris, among others — the film has the feel of a family reunion, though one conspicuously short on the young'uns. There are a lot of gray and white hairs amassed on that stage, plenty of wrinkles and jowls too. Working with the cinematographer Ellen Kuras and nine cameras, including one mounted on a Steadicam, Mr. Demme doesn't shy away from the lines and the jowls; he gives them their due. To watch these weathered faces exchanging practiced glances or temporarily alone in a riff is greatly pleasurable, as well as a nice break from pop culture's plastic unreality.  In "Neil Young: Heart of Gold," the colors shift from ocher to shades of blue as the mood shifts from plaintive to rueful. Every so often a scrim slides awkwardly into place behind the musicians and a painted train cutting across a prairie is replaced with an interior scene of a skinny cat, a fat chair and a fireplace. The show's simplicity and homespun vibe serve Mr. Young's emotionally tremulous songs, both the new and the old, wonderfully well. At one point, during one of his occasional verbal rambles, he says half-jokingly, half-defensively that he's got some love songs left in him. This film, which is at once a valentine from one artist to another and a valentine from a musician to his audience, is surely proof that he does.  Given all the free-flowing love, it may seem churlish to complain about the poor image quality. Shot in Super 16 millimeter, the film looks grubby enough that it might as well have been shot in low-grade video, the visible grain notwithstanding. That's particularly unfortunate, since the camerawork is so good. The camera tends to move only if Mr. Demme wants us to notice something, like the worn-away varnish on Mr. Young's guitar; both the camera movements and the editing take it nice and easy, like the songs. A shot of the full moon over the Ryman before the concert is especially lovely, not only because it alludes to one of Mr. Young's favorite images ("blue moon sinking,"  "full moon risin',"  "yellow moon,"  "silver moon,"  "unfulfilled moon") but also because, I swear, it looks like a beacon.  "Neil Young: Heart of Gold" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It's as clean as a whistle.

The concert film has never looked or sounded classier than Jonathan Demme's superbly crafted "Neil Young: Heart of Gold." In capturing and melding two performances of Young and his band of master musicians last August at Nashville's acoustically legendary Ryman Auditorium, Demme challenges himself to create a poetic work that's far more than a mere recording of artists at the top of their game, while deepening his long involvement with music on film. Stately, classical and even deliberately old-fashioned, February release will have a challenge in attracting crowds beyond Young's legion of fans, but is destined as a vid perennial. 
Only months before the gig, Young had been diagnosed with a potentially fatal brain aneurysm. Faced with mortality, he penned his latest album, "Prairie Wind," in a creative flurry -- like his early classics, "Harvest" and "Harvest Moon," a song cycle rooted in his experiences and memories growing up on the Canadian Midwest plains. (Young successfully went through surgery.)
Concert was conceived as a narrative epic of sorts, linking the new songs with the best-known work from the two earlier albums, resulting in Young's grandest statement yet on the effects of time, age, nature and kinfolk on one's world view.
"Heart of Gold" is vastly different from Young's own recent, inventive and rough-hewn film, "Greendale," or Demme's terrific concert film with Talking Heads, "Stop Making Sense." Young is stronger than ever as a singer of immense expression, and his saga of life and family in the country recalls Elton John's "Tumbleweed Connection" and David Ackles' unjustly forgotten "American Gothic" albums.
After brief interviews with key bandmates en route to the Ryman, pic launches into the concert with a subtle Steadicam move from the crowd and up to the stage. First half is devoted to songs from "Prairie Wind," smoothly presented with only brief fades or breaks between tunes, and with some wonderfully charming and folksy intros by Young. Vet viewers of concert films will soon realize that this is a career-summing pic in the same kind of way that Martin Scorsese's "The Last Waltz" was for the Band.
One of the most redolent "Wind" songs is "This Old Guitar," dedicated to Young's acoustic guitar, dubbed "Hank" because it was once owned by Hank Williams. In his intro, Young notes that this may be "Hank's" first time back at the Ryman since Williams' last gig there in 1951, thus sweetly sealing the vital country connection in the country-rock sensibility that's always been at the center of Young's songwriting.
At the same time, most of the new and old songs are firmly rooted in Canada and Young's farming family, emphasized by the magnificently rendered landscape murals of prairie life conceived by production designer Michael Zansky.
Transition in concert to the '70s classics is perhaps the most impressively subtle aspect of both performance and film. Typically, vet pop stars' concerts that start with fresh material and then dip into the song catalog devolve into a pandering trip down memory lane; not so with Young. Here, the strands of memory and mortality that thread the work in "Prairie Wind" do the same for the "Harvest"-era songs.
As "Greendale" attested, Young has been in the midst of an artistic renaissance, and as both writer and singer, he has never seemed musically and personally more vital than in Demme's film. He drives an excellent band, including core members Ben Keith (a standout on pedal steel guitar), Spooner Oldham, Rick Rosas, Karl Himmel, Chad Cromwell, Wayne Jackson, Grant Boatwright, Larry Cragg (performing on broom, no less, on "Harvest Moon") with superb vocal backup by, among others, Pegi Young (Young's wife) and Emmylou Harris.
Demme's eight-camera coverage is precisely judged for each song, with close-ups and medium shots favored over wide views. Since the stage performance was lit and designed for film, ace d.p. Ellen Kuras employs an array of tools (including beautifully chosen spotlights) to create a painterly look. Though it's hard to detect, each band member wears a distinct yet subtle costume, designed in frontier motifs by Manuel. Editor Andy Keir plays a musical role himself, cutting exactly to the tempi of the tunes.

"Old man, take a look at my life/I'm a lot like you were . . . " The young hippie who wrote those lines turned 60 last November. Few popular singers have been as mindful of their legacy as Neil Young , nor as indifferent to the expectations of fans, critics, or record labels. In the 1980s Geffen famously sued him for producing records "unrepresentative" of himself, but representing himself is what Neil Young is all about. "Take a look at my life" might be his mantra.
Endlessly prolific and intermittently prodigious, he has released four original albums, a live disc, an independent film, and a greatest-hits collection since the turn of the millennium. Diagnosed with a potentially fatal brain aneurysm last spring, shortly after the death of his father, Young flew down to Nashville and wrote and recorded the songs for Prairie Wind  in the four days before his surgery. Post-op, he picked up the phone. "I'm taking a year off and I'd like to make a movie," he instructed Jonathan Demme . ("That's the kind of vacation I like to take too," Demme claimed at Sundance.)
Recorded at the first public performances of Prairie Wind , August 18 and 19 at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium  (erstwhile home of the Grand Ole Opry ), Neil Young: Heart of Gold  recaps and effectively mythologizes this nugget of modern folklore in brief interviews with Young and a band of old reliables, including Spooner Oldham , Grant Boatwright , and Ben Keith .
Plaintive and valedictory, Prairie Wind  unfolds as a testament: Almost all the songs default to the first-person singular, and judging by Young's simple, straightforward intros, he means them to be understood as such. "Here for You" is dedicated to a daughter who has left home. "Far From Home" is about the right resting place, and "This Old Guitar" is a tribute to the instrument he "inherited" from Hank Williams  and will pass on in turn one of these days. Mortality and remembrance are abiding themes; abiding is another.
Training eight Super-16 cameras and a Steadicam  on the showand none on the audienceDemme reflects the simplicity of the songs' acoustic country arrangements in a languorous lexicon of slow dissolves and close-ups. DP Ellen Kuras gets her shots (Young and Emmylou Harris  spotlit centerstage, the auditorium a sea of shadow before them), but the stitching is befittingly ragged.
Canvas backdrops, spartan but expansive, depict the interior of a log cabin fit for giants, a wide-open prairie, or the elongated stained-glass windows of a church. It's the heartland writ large, and the 49th Parallel might as well not exist. Young himself cuts a big, brooding figure in a gray suit, a Stetson crammed low over his eyes. In a flamboyantly mundane bit of staging, guitar tech Larry Cragg  picks up a broom and sweeps accompaniment to "Harvest Moon," one of the evocative back-catalog selections from the film's second half.
It's a sentimental show, sure, but Young's pantheistic hymns to family, friendship, and "the time we share together" are nothing if not heartfelt. Turns out it's better to fade away after all. And as the movie's title acknowledges, old Young is not done yet. The opening lines of "Heart of Gold" promise more to come: "I want to live/I want to give."
