         A wickedly funny satire about a lonely slob from Queens, the Burmese bride he orders from a catalog and the documentary filmmaker who chronicles the debacle before luring her away, "Mail Order Wife" sends up everyone in its circuitous path — self-deluded lonely slobs, self-deluded documentary filmmakers, pretentious chef-worshipping dinner guests, salty old Florida swingers, gold-digging Geisha-girls and that specialized subset of muddle-headed manhood that confuses sexual exploitation with humanitarian concern.
 
  Adrian (Adrian Martinez) is an Eldorado-driving doorman who agrees to let Andrew, a documentary filmmaker, chronicle his marriage to the beautiful Lichi (Eugenia Yuan) in exchange for the cost of the setup. Adrian has selected Lichi from the bride sampler of an "international matchmaking agency" catering to silver-haired gents in yachting caps and the comely but poverty-stricken villagers who love them.
 


         






    Within minutes of bringing her home, though, he is instructing his new bride on the finer points of toilet-scrubbing and amateur porn video production. Things get ugly. And when Andrew comes to the rescue, things get even uglier. (Andrew is played Andrew Gurland, who co-directed "Mail Order Wife" along with Huck Botko).
 
  If the nuggets of P.C. piety and social pretension skewered by "Mail Order Wife" were any meatier, the movie would be a shish kebab.
 
  There's something here to offend every sense of cultural identification and domestic sensibility, and if that doesn't sound wildly appealing, best to check out "Hostage."
 
 
 
  "Mail Order Wife,"
 rated R for language and some disturbing sexual material. Running time: 1 hour, 32 minutes. Exclusively at the Sunset 5, 8000 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (323) 848-3500.
 
 Just remember to dot all the 'I's
 
 
A meet-cute British romance genetically spliced with a cat-and-mouse thriller, "Dot the I" flaunts its mood swings from the opening credits, in which a spunky girl flounces around cool-kid London while someone marks up surveillance stills, forensic style, of the apartment in which she lives.
 
  Carmen (Natalia Verbeke), a volatile but emotionally vulnerable Spanish flamenco dancer and sometime burger flipper, lives with the plummy Brit Barnaby (James D'Arcy). He induces trancelike midcoital ceiling fixations in her, but she agrees to marry him anyway. The real trouble begins on the night of Carmen's bachelorette party, when, in compliance with French tradition enforced by her waiter, she kisses one last man before walking the aisle. The lucky guy turns out to be a half-Brazilian filmmaker named Kit (Gael García Bernal in his first English-speaking role), who from then on devotes himself to chasing Carmen. Kit commits their every stolen moment to video, but the rhythmic crackle of static interference on the soundtrack suggests he's not the only one.
 
  As Carmen is torn between two lovers, the movie vacillates between teasing out the romantic agonies of Carmen, Kit and Barnaby, and torturing its trumped-up, self-referential plot about moviemaking. The principal actors are charismatic enough to have carried the love story. But first-time writer-director Matthew Parkhill prefers to lean on clever plot devices, amp up the roles of the movie's sideline jesters Tom (Tom Hardy) and Theo (Charlie Cox), crank up the static noise and fail to notice that his engaging little romance has broken with reality and veered into hollow pastiche.

 It's 'Off the Map' in so many ways
 
 
It takes a rugged survivalist mentality to sit through 108 minutes of "Off the Map," a self-consciously loopy and mystical drama about a family that lives off the map, off the grid, off the land and mostly off their meds in the mangy desert of New Mexico.
 
  Directed by Campbell Scott ("Final" and, with Stanley Tucci, "Big Night") and adapted by Joan Ackermann from her own play, the movie plays like the al fresco production of a parody of social realist theater — all rangy speeches, quirky characters and wild, roaming symbols. Bo (Valentina de Angelis) is a precocious, home-schooled 11-year-old whose father, Charley (Sam Elliott), comes down with a crippling depression one summer.
 
  While dad weeps mutely in the outhouse and mom Arlene (Joan Allen) hoes the garden naked, Bo pines (who wouldn't?) for the all-American pleasures denied her: a suburban lawn, a new Girl Scout uniform, parents with jobs, a credit card. Salvation appears — or so she thinks — in the form of a newly minted IRS agent who weathers a 10-mile walk in the desert to find them. William Gibbs (Jim True-Frost) comes for the audit but stays — forever — for the enchantment. Fans of the irrepressibly kooky will enjoy such flights of whimsy as a preadolescent scrub-dweller ordering a custom-made sailboat on her new "MasterCharge." How does the delivery guy find the unchartered homestead? She draws him a map.

ff the Map," a portrait of modern-day pioneers braving the wilds of New Mexico in 1974, stays as far away from the movie mainstream as its characters remain detached from the teeming hubbub of American mass culture. Slow, ruminative and dusted with wisps of folksy humor, the film, directed by Campbell Scott from a screenplay by Joan Ackermann, has neither the arc nor the dramatic beats dictated by screenwriting manuals. As it shuffles along a flat dramatic landscape to its own deliberately poky rhythms, an acceptance of its pace requires considerable adjustment. Even then, the film often frequently gets stuck in one of the ruts that scar the dirt road it travels. Arlene (Joan Allen) and Charley  Groden (Sam Elliott)  and their smart-aleck, super-intelligent daughter Bo (Valentina de Angelis), live on a small isolated farm in the heart of coyote country near Taos; distant blue mountains line the horizon. Subsisting on Veterans Administration checks and earnings from handicrafts (about $5,000 a year), the Grodens are proudly self-sufficient, do-it-yourself virtuosos. Charley's best friend, George (J. K. Simmons), is their only regular visitor. The Grodens' life, for all its bohemian appeal, is no hippie idyll. As the story begins, Charley has sunk into a clinical, nearly catatonic depression that has turned him into a weepy crying machine, and the restless 11-year-old Bo announces that she has applied for a credit card. Then who should stumble onto their property but an I.R.S. agent, William Gibbs (Jim True-Frost), dispatched from Albuquerque to find out why the Grodens have failed to file any income tax returns for the previous seven years. William, the farthest thing from a bureaucratic ogre, is a lost soul who explains that his lifelong depression began at the age of 6 when he arrived home from school to discover his mother's suicide. In short order, he is stung by a bee and contracts a high fever that keeps him at the Grodens' homestead. When he recovers, he immediately blurts out that he has fallen deeply in love with Arlene, who shrugs off the confession. The movie, which Ms. Ackermann adapted from her own play, is narrated by the grown-up Bo (Amy Brenneman), seen only in flashes. Her flighty voice-over includes swatches of poetic reflection that only the most independent-spirited film would dare keep intact. One major riff is a meditation on the curvature of the earth as imagined after gazing toward the horizon from the shores of Cape Cod. That soliloquy inspires a 41-foot-long painting undertaken by William, who deserts  Internal Revenue to live with the family and be a full-time artist. With a director, screenwriter and star who have deep roots in the theater, "Off the Map"  is more than anything an actor's  film. Ms. Allen, whose straight brown hair streams down her back, is completely convincing as a capable, unsentimental workhorse with a huge reserve of patience. The only time she loses her composure is upon discovering the dead body of a coyote, which she lays to rest with a Hopi Indian ritual. If Ms. Allen's strong performance in "The Upside of Anger," which also opens today, makes you crave a double dip of her talents, here is a rich second helping. Mr. Elliott, who grounds his portrayal of a depressed man with a steady bass note of humor, matches her in depth, as does Ms. de Angelis as the impulsive, impatient Bo, itching to fly the coop. Their performances try to fill the gaps of a story that finally adds up to less than the sum of its disconnected parts. "Off the Map" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes sexual situations and some strong language.
Were it not so soporific, Off the Map  could easily drive you off your nut. Opening two years after its Sundance premiere, Campbell Scott 's second solo featureadapted by Joan Ackermann  from her playharks back to the wholesome granola the festival used to dispense two decades ago. Bo, an obnoxiously chattering 11-year-old (Valentina de Angelis ) lives with her near catatonic dad (Sam Elliott ) and old-soul mom (Joan Allen ) somewhere in the drop-out exurbs of Taos, New Mexico .
Such action as there is, is largely filtered through Bo's consciousness, a fount of sitcom one-liners. Dad's grizzled western bud (J.K. Simmons ) comes to hang out as Bo is home-schooled by Mom's readings from Two Years Before the Mast . The world intrudes when a bumbling young revenue agent (Jim True-Frost ) gloms the Edenic sight of Mom naked in her garden. At some point in the chastely hysterical montage, he's stung by a beeas could happen to anyone. He stays, moving into a blue school bus to take up water painting. As luck would have it, he too is clinically depressed and thus able to furnish Dad with some salutary pills.
Who are these people? Had the movie been made in the 1980s, they would have been wackos and fatties and the tax man a German tourist. But Off the Map  is specifically set during the summer of 1974. (There's a scene in which Mom ostentatiously ignores the sound of Nixon  resigning on the radio.) Mystic signs signal through the lazy swirl of hippie-dippienessMom draws on her knowledge of Hopi medicine, there's a coyote noble as a collie, and reference is made to a pet goat presciently named for the not yet cult star Harry Dean Stanton . Pondering the fashion statement of the family's adobe spread, the revenue man dumbs down Easy Rider instead of telling Dad that he's doin' his own thing in his own time, he simply notes, "I think you're a genius."
Gawrsh. Some actor-directors give performers license to wail. Scott is more restrained. True-Frost plays his character for vague comedy. After The Big Lebowski , which Elliott narrated, it might be difficult to take his thick-voiced cowboy gravitas as seriously as Off the Map  does. Indeed, de Angelis's noisy self-dramatizing notwithstanding, the perfs here are largely a matter of posing. Erect and watchful as she scans the horizon, Allen is a gingham Gary Cooper . She's a weathered part of the landscape gently eroded by a zephyr of snores.
