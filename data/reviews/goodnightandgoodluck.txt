"Good Night, and Good Luck" is a puzzle: a hermetically sealed period piece so intensely relevant to our current state of affairs that it takes your breath away.
Directed and co-written by George Clooney, it also removes any doubt that the former Dr. Doug Ross of TV's "ER" is a filmmaker of uncommon thoughtfulness and skill. Formal problems aside, "Good Night" is a call to civic responsibility and renewed purpose in broadcast journalism that demands to be seen and discussed by audiences of all ages and political stripes. It's that important.
That maddening, too. The story of TV newsman Edward R. Murrow's 1954 decision to take on Senator Joe McCarthy and his anti-Communist witch hunt, on the air and using just the facts, has been turned into a small, hard diamond of black-and-white polemic. Clooney and his co-writer, Grant Heslov (who appears in a small role), hunker down with Murrow's crew in CBS's Manhattan headquarters and rarely leave the building. The camera hovers and ducks in close, past the omnipresent cigarette smoke of Murrow (David Strathairn) and into the inner sanctum of avid young men -- and they are, pointedly, almost all men -- creating the infant medium of TV news on the spot.
What we see of the outside world is what they saw: footage. There is no actor playing McCarthy, and when Murrow invites the senator in for an on-air rebuttal, it's the real Joe McCarthy we see, delivering his actual televised response. At one point, Clooney cedes directorial control to a long, undigested chunk of congressional testimony from Annie Lee Moss, an elderly African-American woman who worked in the Pentagon basement and was accused by the senator of being a communist. She has never heard of this Karl Marx fellow, but McCarthy and his wing man, Roy Cohn, press absurdly on.
Murrow played this footage on air, too, but was careful to state that neither he nor CBS had evidence of Moss's actual political beliefs (which in fact turned out to be more complex than she admitted). Clooney uses it as a straight-up bid for audience sympathy, and it's one of the rare missteps in "Good Night, and Good Luck." Another is the inclusion of what appears to be a CBS in-house jazz combo, anchored by singer Dianne Reeves, that provides the smoky, late-night musical score. A touch of whimsy, it cuts against the grain of rigorous realism the movie works so hard to establish elsewhere.
Much more often, this is a film of fierce and uncompromising ideas given human dimension by a terrific cast, all of whom play it smart, taut, tight. Clooney and Heslov's script errs on the side of sanctification -- McCarthy's public slide had begun well before CBS took the plunge -- but in the playing 
Strathairn's Murrow is a man of unemotional gravitas who simply has had enough. When the legendary newsman decides to use his flagship program "See It Now" to make a case for Air Force Lieutenant Milo Radulovich after the latter is frog-marched out of the armed forces because his immigrant father reads a Serbian newspaper, it's a dangerous event. Alcoa wants to pull its ads; the godlike CBS chairman William Paley (Frank Langella) sweats cold bullets. "I've searched my conscience," Murrow tells Paley, "and I cannot accept that there are two equivalent sides to every story." The Army reinstated Radulovich a month after the broadcast.
Clooney casts himself as Fred Friendly, "See It Now" producer and easygoing good cop to Murrow's Sergeant Joe Friday; the performance needs to be ingratiating and intelligent, and it's both of those things. Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson provide further warmth as Joe and Shirley Wershba -- secretly wed despite the network's ban on married couples -- while Jeff Daniels plays producer Sid Mickelson as a man waiting with hope and dread to see what Murrow will do next. As newsman Don Hollenbeck, who committed suicide in 1954 under pressure from McCarthyite forces in the press, Ray Wise trembles rather too heavily with oncoming martyrdom.
But this is a beautifully professional movie about professionals coming to appreciate the full measure of their duty, as journalists and as Americans. Early in "Good Night, and Good Luck" -- the title comes from Murrow's on-air sign-off -- a loyalty oath floats around the CBS offices, but the newsman doesn't blink. "We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty," he tells the viewing public. "We cannot defend freedom abroad while deserting it at home."
Ouch.
 As if this weren't a sharp enough jab in the side of 21st century broadcast journalism, addicted to ratings and terrified to take a stand (except for Fox News, which is all stand, all the time), Clooney opens and closes "Good Night" with bits of the 1958 industry dinner speech in which Murrow correctly foresaw and mourned the future of his medium.
"We are currently wealthy, fat, comfortable, and complacent," he tells his uneasy audience of movers and shakers. "We have currently a built-in allergy to unpleasant or disturbing information. Our mass media reflect this. But unless we get up off our fat surpluses and recognize that television in the main is being used to distract, delude, amuse, and insulate us, then television and those who finance it, those who look at it, and those who work at it, may see a totally different picture too late."
Hell of a speech, and the full text is online if you care to look it up. It's tacked awkwardly on to the rest of the movie, but you don't mind, because the faults of "Good Night, and Good Luck" are faults of commitment. Clooney understands you can sometimes see more inside the TV fishbowl looking out than the other way around. He also knows there are far worse things than holding Ed Murrow up to modern audiences and asking them to emulate his horse sense and innate fairness.


         "Good Night, and Good Luck" couldn't be more unlikely, more unfashionable — or more compelling. Everything about it — its look, its style, even its sound — stands in stark opposition to the trends of the moment. Yet by sticking to events that are half a century old, it tells a story whose implications for today are inescapable.
 
  An examination of the stand CBS newsman Edward R. Murrow took in 1954 against Sen. Joseph McCarthy, "Good Night" is a marvel of classic restraint in a hopped-up film culture. Shot in elegant black and white with impeccable ensemble acting and moody jazz riffs for a soundtrack, it wouldn't exist except for the lonely passion of director, co-writer and costar George Clooney.
 


         






    The son of a TV anchorman, Clooney had the nerve to believe that a drama of ideas could be as entertaining as "Desperate Housewives." He insisted that a fight for America's soul, a clash of values over critical intellectual issues like freedom of the press and the excesses of government, had an inherent intensity that would carry everything before it. And it does.
 
  What is especially dramatic about the lean, carefully measured script Clooney co-wrote with actor-producer Grant Heslov (who has a cameo as Murrow colleague Don Hewitt) is its determination to show how agonizingly difficult it is to do the right thing.
 
  While in retrospect it's easy to believe that standing up against the brutish junior senator from Wisconsin was so much the obvious thing to do that we all would have done it in a heartbeat, "Good Night" takes pains to show how much Murrow risked — and in fact lost — by deciding to take that perilous and unpopular step.
 
  To make sure his film was true to the nuances of the situation, Clooney made two key choices: Feeling that no actor could convincingly capture the unsettling combination of bluster, innuendo and meanness that characterized McCarthy, he decided to show the senator only in archival footage. And after briefly flirting with the idea of taking the part of Murrow himself, he gave it to David Strathairn, who made it the role of a lifetime.
 
  Still identified with his fine work in John Sayles films such as "Matewan" and "Eight Men Out," the actor's innate air of gravitas and concern helps him appear more like Murrow than Murrow himself. Strathairn's newscaster is part pillar of rectitude, part bird of prey, a driven man of impeccable taste and tightly wound presence who was never far from the cigarettes that led to an early death.
 
  The best part of Strathairn's haunted, haunting performance is his voice, the way he is able to uncannily reproduce Murrow's unmistakable cadences. A big chunk of Murrow's words in the film are taken directly from his speeches and on-air commentary, and hearing Strathairn read them is close enough to the real thing to be positively spooky.
 
  "Good Night, and Good Luck" is in fact bookended by Murrow's most famous speech, one he gave to the Radio-Television News Directors Assn. in 1958, four years after he confronted McCarthy, a savage jeremiad about the state of television that is if anything truer today than it was then. The film opens with Murrow talking about the medium's "built-in allergy to unpleasant or disturbing information" and laments that television "in the main is being used to distract, delude, amuse and insulate us." He is not a happy man.
 
  The film then cuts back to 1953, to a CBS projection room that consciously echoes a similar scene in "Citizen Kane." Murrow and his young Turks, including producer Joe Wershba (Robert Downey Jr.), are looking at McCarthy footage and trying to decide if they want to do a piece on the plight of Lt. Milo Radulovich, a Navy pilot about to be kicked out of the military because of suspicious charges of disloyalty that he has not even been able to see, much less respond to.
 
  CBS' very corporate No. 2 Sig Mickelson (a letter-perfect Jeff Daniels) thinks this is not such a good idea, but Murrow is unrepentant and he and his producer, Fred Friendly (Clooney himself), run with the piece. "I've searched my conscience," Murrow says like a man who means it, "and I can't for the life of me find any justification for this."
 
  When, as expected, McCarthy responds by accusing Murrow of having been on the Soviet payroll, the newscaster and his network begin the slow, agonizing process of deciding to take on the senator in a more pointed way. Murrow's boss, William Paley (Frank Langella), would rather he stick to fluffy interviews on his "Person to Person" program (a particularly arch one with Liberace is included), but finally the air of rectitude Murrow always projected was too much for his employer to resist.
 
  Still, everyone at CBS, especially Murrow's cohorts, is panicked at the potential consequences of confronting someone powerful and seemingly unassailable, which is one reason Murrow perseveres.
 
  "We're going to go with the story because the terror is right here in this room," he tells his team, a terror we feel as much as they do.
 
  Strong as he was in private, Murrow was even more articulate in public, and to hear Strathairn read impeccably written lines like "We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty" and "We cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home" is to note with sadness how far from that kind of eloquence the broadcast media has come today.
 
  As a director intent on showing how Murrow's choice played out, Clooney has himself made all the right choices, starting with the decision he made to narrow the focus to the issues at hand. Except for a brief scene of Wershba's home life — because of company policy his marriage to colleague Shirley Wershba (Patricia Clarkson) was a secret — we seldom see these characters outside the windowless environment of the TV studio.
 
  The controlled, claustrophobic chaos of that hermetic world is so smartly re-created by production designer Jim Bissell and his team and faultlessly shot by veteran cinematographer Robert Elswit that its lack of breathable air seems to emphasize the seriousness of the situation. Only the potent jazz phrasings of a nameless singer in an adjacent studio, played by triple Grammy winner Dianne Reeves, provides any kind of emotional release.
 
  "Good Night, and Good Luck" returns at its close to Murrow's own words, specifically to that celebrated 1958 speech it opened with. Very much the angry god taking on broadcasting's sinners, Murrow resorts to withering scorn against those who say people wouldn't be interested in intelligent, involved television.
 
  "Because if they are right," he concludes, "and this instrument is good for nothing but to entertain, amuse and insulate, then the tube is flickering now and we will soon see that the whole struggle is lost. Otherwise, it is merely wires and lights in a box .... Good night. And good luck."
 
  That last phrase, Murrow's trademark signoff, gives Clooney's film an unexpectedly melancholy tinge. For what is unavoidable about "Good Night, and Good Luck" is its reminder that the battles the newscaster struggled with are never permanently won but must be re-fought by every generation. Without someone as fearless, eloquent and impassioned as Murrow to fight them, we'll need all the luck we can get the next time around.

In Good Night, and Good Luck , Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn), elegant and severe, the dour straight shooter of postwar broadcast news, prepares to go on air for his nightly report on CBS by lighting up a cigarette. I figured he was calming his nerves, enjoying a smoke as a preshow ritual. But no. The camera blinks on, the broadcast begins, and Murrow is not only still smoking, he's doing it flamboyantly  his forearm planted on the desk, his hand cocked in the manner of an aristocratic silent-movie star, the entire report punctuated by the no-nonsense virility of his quick, blustery drags. Since Good Night, and Good Luck  has been directed, by George Clooney, and written, by Clooney and Grant Heslov, as an unabashed salute to Murrow  his courage and gravitas, his devotion to reporting the truth in the face of corruption and power  it's a shock, at least for those who didn't grow up with him, to see this theatrical display of on-air indulgence. Murrow may have been a firebrand, but he was every inch a showman, too.
Set in 1953, the year Murrow dared to expose and fight the bullying clampdown tactics of Sen. Joseph McCarthy, Good Night, and Good Luck  is a curio: an energized sliver of history, smart, sharp, and lively, staged with enjoyable panache, yet so tidy and hermetic and limited in scope that it's like a one-hour PBS documentary stretched into dramatic form. The film has been shot in silky black and white, a look that evokes the burnished out-of-the-shadows romanticism of Citizen Kane  and film noir as much as the buttoned-down world of '50s TV. Strathairn, his hair greased back, the furrows in his face lit like statuesque crags, does a pitch-perfect imitation of Murrow's granite scowl and dry-voiced, almost caustic urgency, and Clooney shoots him from dramatic low angles, turning the broadcasts into charged nightly sermons. Good Night, and Good Luck  exudes a reverence for what it sees as the faded glory days of TV news, yet it's also more than a tad wistful for the era of Murrow's cigarette  for his self-conscious, hard-boiled style of truth-telling. The movie salutes Murrow's integrity by turning integrity into nostalgia.
In his second outing as a director, Clooney expertly evokes the revved, split-second drama of the early days of live TV, when even the most serious news report could be ''edited'' together at the moment it was being shown. He has fun, too, with that homogenized '50s frivolousness, as when Murrow does a hilarious interview with Liberace. It's no wonder that the tough newsman, along with his producer, Fred Friendly (played by Clooney as a genial ace politician), is eager to make waves. Drawn to the case of a man tossed out of the Navy for his shaky ''communist'' affiliations, Murrow begins to report on McCarthy, his just-the-facts-ma'am approach shading into righteous advocacy. The film turns into a black-and-white showdown of good and evil. McCarthy is seen flinging mud at witnesses in extended vintage news clips, which are woven into the action, as if no mere actor could have done justice to the senator's sleazy shamelessness. It's a technique at once effective and self-canceling: We get so caught up in the brutal reality of McCarthy that the movie itself comes to seem, at times, like mere decoration. After all, why not show clips of Murrow, too? You almost could, considering the film never tries to dig beneath his flinty facade. The Murrow who fights McCarthy and stands up to CBS chairman William S. Paley, played with worldly gruff force by Frank Langella, is the only Murrow we see.
There's a reason that Good Night, and Good Luck , as nimble and craftsmanly as it is, feels thin. The movie's passion, and in a sense its true subject, remains off screen: It's there in Clooney's presumption that the audience will see Murrow taking on McCarthy and make an analogy to the present day, asking itself why no one in our corporatized media culture has dared to take a comparable fearless stand against the Bush administration. But the analogy is facile at best. George Bush, whatever you may think of his policies, isn't Joe McCarthy, and it's not as if his most fervent detractors in the press have been silenced. To suggest that the spirit of Edward R. Murrow has been crushed out of journalism is to turn nostalgia for the age of stern father-figure newsmen into the stuff of conspiracy theory.
Good Night, and Good Luck  has a small-scale time-capsule fascination, yet its hermeticism is really a form of moral caution  a way of keeping the issues neat, the liberal idealism untainted. ''Look!'' the movie says. ''TV news once had room for heroes!'' Well, yes, but I'd have been more inspired if the film didn't have such unquestioned reverence for the age when freedom in media hinged on one saintly man, saving the people from on high.
2006 Oscar Nominations:  Best Picture; Best Actor (David Strathairn); Best Director (George Clooney); Best Original Screenplay (George Clooney and Grant Heslov); Best Art Direction; Best Cinematography

 SHOT in a black-and-white palette of cigarette smoke, hair tonic, dark suits and pale button-down shirts, "Good Night, and Good Luck" plunges into a half-forgotten world in which television was new, the cold war was at its peak, and the Surgeon General's report on the dangers of tobacco was still a decade in the future. Though it is a meticulously detailed reconstruction of an era, the film, directed by George Clooney from a script he wrote with Grant Heslov, is concerned with more than nostalgia.  Burnishing the legend of Edward R. Murrow, the CBS newsman who in the 1940's and 50's established a standard of journalistic integrity his profession has scrambled to live up to ever since, "Good Night, and Good Luck" is a passionate, thoughtful essay on power, truth-telling and responsibility. It opens the New York Film Festival tonight and will be released nationally on Oct. 7. The title evokes Murrow's trademark sign-off, and I can best sum up my own response by recalling the name of his flagship program: See it now.  And be prepared to pay attention. "Good Night, and Good Luck" is not the kind of historical picture that dumbs down its material, or walks you carefully through events that may be unfamiliar. Instead, it unfolds, cinéma-vérité style, in the fast, sometimes frantic present tense, following Murrow and his colleagues as they deal with the petty annoyances and larger anxieties of news gathering at a moment of political turmoil. The story flashes back from a famous, cautionary speech that Murrow gave at an industry convention in 1958 to one of the most notable episodes in his career - his war of words and images with Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.  While David Strathairn plays Murrow with sly eloquence and dark wit, Mr. Clooney allows the junior Senator from Wisconsin to play himself (thanks to surviving video clips of his hearings and public appearances), a jolt of documentary truth that highlights some of the movie's themes. Television, it suggests, can be both a potent vehicle for demagoguery and a weapon in the fight against it.  Mr. Clooney, who plays Murrow's producer and partner, Fred Friendly, has clearly thought long and hard about the peculiar, ambiguous nature of the medium. It is a subject that comes naturally to him: his father, Nick, was for many years a local television newscaster in Cincinnati, and the younger Mr. Clooney's own star first rose on the small screen. Like "Good Night, and Good Luck," his first film, "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" (2002), used the biography of a television personality (Chuck Barris of "The Gong Show") as a way of exploring the medium's capacity to show the truth, and also to distort and obscure it.  Indeed, these two movies can almost be seen as companion pieces. "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" suggests that a man with a hard time telling truth from fiction can find a natural home on the tube, while "Good Night, and Good Luck" demonstrates that a furiously honest, ruthlessly rational person may find it less comfortable. Murrow, as conceived by the filmmakers and incarnated by Mr. Strathairn, is a man of strong ideals and few illusions. He knows that McCarthy will smear him (and offers the Senator  airtime to do so), and that sponsors and government officials will pressure his boss, William Paley (Frank Langella), to rein him in.  He is aware that his reports are part of a large, capitalist enterprise, and makes some necessary concessions. In addition to his investigative reports - and, in effect, to pay for them - Murrow conducts celebrity interviews, including one with Liberace, which Mr. Clooney has lovingly and mischievously rescued from the archives.  From that odd encounter to the kinescopes of the Army-McCarthy hearings, "Good Night, and Good Luck" brilliantly recreates the milieu of early television. (Robert Elswit's smoky cinematography and Stephen Mirrione's suave, snappy editing are crucial to this accomplishment.) It also captures, better than any recent movie I can think of, the weirdly hermetic atmosphere of a news organization at a time of crisis.  Nearly all the action takes place inside CBS headquarters (or at the bar where its employees drink after hours), which gives the world outside a detached, almost abstract quality. A telephone rings, an image flickers on a screen, a bulldog edition of the newspaper arrives (sometimes it's this one, whose television critic, Jack Gould, was one of Murrow's champions) - this is what it means for information to be mediated.  But its effects are nonetheless real. While the camera never follows Friendly or Murrow home from the office, and the script never delves into psychology, we see how the climate of paranoia and uncertainty seeps into the lives of some of their co-workers. Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise), an anchor for the New York CBS affiliate, is viciously red-baited by a newspaper columnist, and Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson) skulk around the office like spies (though for reasons that have more to do with office politics than with national security). When Murrow, in March 1954, prepares to broadcast his exposé of McCarthy's methods, the suspense is excruciating, even if we know the outcome.  Because we do, it is possible to view "Good Night, and Good Luck" simply as a reassuring story of triumph. But the film does more than ask us, once again, to admire Edward R. Murrow and revile Joseph R. McCarthy. That layer of the story is, as it should be, in stark black-and-white, but there is a lot of gray as well, and quite a few questions that are not so easily resolved. The free press may be the oxygen of a democratic society, but it is always clouded by particles and pollutants, from the vanity or cowardice of individual journalists to the impersonal pressures of state power and the profit motive.  And while Mr. Clooney is inclined to glorify, he does not simplify. The scenes between Murrow and Paley, taking place in the latter's cryptlike office, have an almost Shakespearean gravity, and not only because Mr. Strathairn and Mr. Langella perform their roles with such easy authority. McCarthy may serve as the hissable villain, but Paley is a more complicated foil for Murrow - at once patron, antagonist and protector. (Addressed by everyone else, in hushed tones, as "Mr. Paley," he is "Bill" only to Murrow.)  Most of the discussion of this movie will turn on its content - on the history it investigates and on its present-day resonance. This is a testament to Mr. Clooney's modesty (as is the fact that, on screen, he makes himself look doughy and pale), but also to his skill. Over the years he has worked with some of the smartest directors around, notably Joel Coen and Steven Soderbergh (who is an executive producer of this film). And while he has clearly learned from them, the cinematic intelligence on display in this film is entirely his own. He has found a cogent subject, an urgent set of ideas and a formally inventive, absolutely convincing way to make them live on screen.  "Good Night, and Good Luck" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Apart from a little rough language, it is as clean as the television broadcasts it describes.

A vital chapter of mid-century history is brought to life concisely, with intimacy and matter-of-fact artistry in "Good Night, and Good Luck." In his second directorial outing, George Clooney pays tribute to the golden era of black-and-white '50s television drama and to a moment when a smart, brave news broadcaster, Edward R. Murrow, successfully confronted the hysteria being whipped up by a political bully, Sen. Joseph McCarthy; latter element assures pic's status as the liberal feel-good movie of the year. Strong critical reaction likely to emanate from bows at the Venice and New York film festivals, as well as extensive off-entertainment page coverage, will translate into an enthusiastic audience embrace in specialized release, although pic's small scale and period setting will test Warner Independent's ability to muscle such a film through to a more general public.
From the first minute he's onscreen, David Strathairn is
 Edward R. Murrow. From the lean physique and dark features to his taciturn air, imperturbable disposition and implacable directness of address, the habitually understated actor entirely inhabits the biggest screen role of his career. In a piece not intended as a psychological study, Strathairn quietly suggests the ways in which Murrow's challenge of McCarthy tested the depth of his character's nerve, resolve and self-certainty. It's a tour de force performance of great subtlety in a deliberately narrow range.
Framed by a speech Murrow gave at an industry tribute in 1958, script by Clooney and Grant Heslov is set between October 1953 and the spring of the following year, with the action almost entirely confined to the CBS studios and offices. Focus remains intently upon intelligent, aggressive professionals doing their jobs: fielding information, weighing its merits and making decisions based on the importance of news and the risks of putting it out over a new, commercially driven medium.
No time is spent explaining who Murrow and McCarthy were or even who was president; young or foreign auds not familiar with such basics will either have to get up to speed in advance or pay extra-close attention. At the outset, the 45-year-old Murrow hosts two of the most notable shows on CBS-TV, the news-and-commentary-oriented "See It Now" and the popular celebrity interview program "Person to Person."
Against the background of demands for employee loyalty oaths and the communist witch hunts orchestrated by the senator from Wisconsin in his position as chairman of the Government Committee on Operations for the Senate, the "See It Now" team takes up the cause of airman Milo Radulovich, who has been summarily discharged from the armed forces without trial and based on sealed evidence. With the nervous backing of the network and despite pressure from military brass, Murrow challenges the dismissal on the air, with the figurative result of making McCarthy blink.
Predictably, however, Murrow begins being painted with the same pinko brush that's short-circuiting the career of fellow CBS newsman, Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise). Murrow must also endure tense meetings with his boss, William Paley (Frank Langella), who, while insisting his staff be politically "clean" and suggesting that the public prefers safe entertainment to topical controversy, reminds his star broadcaster that he has never censored or disallowed anything Murrow wanted to put on the air.
With newsroom action and dialogue flowing in the manner of '30s newspaper melodramas, it's not always entirely clear who's who and who does what. Most prominent, however, are Murrow's "See It Now" producer Fred Friendly (Clooney), a dynamic collaborator and supporter of his on-air partner, and Joe and Shirley Wershba (Robert Downey Jr. and Patricia Clarkson), valued team members who, due to network rules, must keep their marriage secret.
Paley's backing enables Murrow to go ahead with the March 9, 1954, broadcast in which he takes on McCarthy by rebutting the smear campaign against him, then by boldly spotlighting the senator's lamentable technique of making accusations without evidence, with the intent of stirring the public to rise against the prevailing climate of fear.
Offered the opportunity to respond, McCarthy persists in his unspecified slander of Murrow and others and fails to address the newsman's charges.
As presented here, Murrow's successful confrontation with McCarthy can be seen as the beginning of the senator's undoing; his hearings continued -- some viewers will be surprised to see archival footage of the young Robert Kennedy on the team with Roy Cohn during one of the latter's harangues -- but the tide began turning, leading to McCarthy's censure by the Senate. A very amusing throwaway moment has Murrow genially conducting a live cross-country interview with Liberace while desperately trying to overhear details of the Army-McCarthy hearings.
Clooney and his co-scenarist, producer and fellow actor Heslov lay out the contemporary relevance of some of the issues for anyone to see, particularly as regards civil liberties and the existence of an extreme socio-political divide in the United States. But they don't push it, which frees the film from the dreaded limitation of preaching to the choir. In fact, "Good Night, and Good Luck." is the second picture this year from ostensibly liberal-left filmmakers (after the hit Sundance docu "Why We Fight") to use speeches by President Eisenhower to endorse their perspectives on post-war American history.
Robert Elswit's agile, lustrous black-and-white lensing mixes beautifully with the vintage 16mm and kinescope material in which McCarthy himself and others are seen. While Clooney's elegant, on-the-move visual style makes no attempt to match the more static, high-contrast look of '50s TV, it is nevertheless highly evocative of it, providing a rich atmosphere for the densely packed drama. All other design elements, from the credible newsroom and studio sets to the detail of the period equipment, are exemplary.
Strathairn is first among equals in the exemplary ensemble, with Clooney's vigorous Friendly, Langella's polished and authoritative Paley and the more understated duo of Downey and Clarkson making the strongest impressions.
Led by the chain-smoking Murrow, whose persona was not complete without a cigarette in hand, practically everyone here smokes like a furnace, so much so that the anti-smoking-in-movies fanatics would have to slap "Good Night, and Good Luck." with a XXX rating. With saner heads still prevailing, pic is rated PG, enabling younger audiences the unimpeded opportunity of a thoroughly absorbing glimpse into recent history.

Though it may have been some kind of career-long desire for George Clooney , whose father was a Cincinnati  and Lexington  broadcaster through much of the mid-century, Good Night, and Good Luck , with its return to the cultural havoc of McCarthyism is aptly timed. If it functions only as a kind of mini-realist, moral-minded history lesson for today's principle-free media circus and giga-shopped news victims, that alone would make it a landmark in new-millennium Hollywood . On the other hand, Clooney's brilliantly orchestrated and seriously respectful movie can be seen as a grim shoulder tap, lamenting the social irresponsibility of what Gore Vidal  likes to call the "United States of Amnesia"have the lessons of 1953 ever found a deep seat in our memory? Karl Rove  would say no, and he'd have an easy case to make. The past may not even be past, and Joseph E. McCarthy , playing himself here in the preserved video nightmares of television's messy adolescence, scans as one part Nixon , one part Cheney, and one part insecure Lex Luther , bawling and huffing his way to infamy.
It's a stunning performance, but it's only the archival anchor stone of Good Night , which is otherwise a meticulous period piece, down to the omnipresent tobacco consumption (just watching I could feel the dark spots form on my lungs). Shot in pearly, newsy black-and-white, Clooney's sophomore directorial shot sticks closely to the details at hand: the slow step up to the plate performed by popular CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow  (David Strathairn ) in response to McCarthy's HUAC witch hunt, essentially constituting a sole voice crying in a wilderness of shit-scared American journalism. Hardly fleshed out as a character in the screenplay, Strathairn's Murrow remains as much of a humorless, hangdog icon to us as the real Murrow represented to his millions of faithful viewers; his most expressive scenes are broadcast editorials, addressed directly at the camera. The show's production team does all of the reactive heavy lifting, including producer Fred Friendly  (Clooney), and it's the evocation of the era's office spaces and studio bustle, tamped down but not quite fizzled by anti-Communist paranoia, that makes the movie bloom. The ensembleincluding Patricia Clarkson , Robert Downey Jr. , and Ray Wise , as suicidal anchorman Don Hollenbeckall find their moments in Clooney's dense, all-business tumult, but the film is conscientiously about comradeship and community.
Perhaps too specifically soGood Night 's modest budget constricts the action almost exclusively to the bell jar of the workplace, leaving us eventually hankering for a taste of the wide world outside. In a strategy that certainly makes its own topical statement, the larger context of the Murrow staff's on-air contest with McCarthy is provided exclusively through the tube. Still, the Senate hearings themselves are taken as read and shown to us in precious snippets. Clooney's priorities lie with Murrow and his nonchalant heroism, using his career and reputation to face down a public demon no one else dares crosseven if, as NBC president William Paley  (Frank Langella ) points out, Murrow's ripostes against McCarthy's mendacious practices are not necessarily disagreements with his Red-hunting purposes. The film is succinct and compact and unpretentious, but between its lines lurks a vast and chaotic social struggle, among ethical rectitude, private preservation, and the duties of media to support the citizenry, not, as Murrow says in podium polemic, "to distract, delude, denude, and isolate us."
Good Night, and Good Luck 's primary handicap is history itselfthe toe-to-toe televised dialogue between McCarthy and Murrow was, however arguably vital to the Wisconsin senator's eventual retreat, brief and less than epochal. Even so, the wonderfully mustered context wins out: Clooney's film is meant to reflect the present state of fourth estate bankruptcy and federal fraud, but it's also an invigorating day trip into a more sophisticated yesteryear and maybe something of an eye-opener for culturati born since the Nixon administration, for whom an anchorman who speaks in multiple clauses, who quotes from Shakespeare , and whose basic righteousness dictated his actions is as familiar as a politician with respect for his constituents.
