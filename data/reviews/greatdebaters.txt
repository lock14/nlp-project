In his second outing as a director, Washington chooses an inspirational story, yet even though The Great Debaters
 is a historical story worth telling, the film is hobbled by the narrative predictability that inevitably governs this type of drama. Like his first directorial effort, Antwone Fisher
, The Great Debaters
 is based on a true story in which Washington casts himself in the role of the elder leading man, the guiding figure who helps characters from the younger generation overcome the damage of their past and grab hold of the opportunities for their future. Although Washington is perfectly fine in his performance here as the professor and coach of Wiley College's national-championship-winning debate team in 1935, the role calls for no special showmanship on the part of the dependably brilliant actor. So, too, as the director, Washington brings no special stylistic flourish to the film, instead placing himself at the straightforward service of the Oprah Winfrey-produced story. He plays the role of Melvin B. Tolson, who coaches to victory the all-black Wiley College debate team, which goes on to become the first black team to debate white opponents before riding its winning streak all the way to Boston to unseat the reigning champions at Harvard. The small Marshall, Texas, college is set in the Depression-era, Jim Crow, union-busting South, and the film's atmospherics capture the milieu with striking detail. It is a time and place where segregation is the norm, and lynchings still occur, although the students represent a new generation that has been raised to believe it can beat the odds stacked against it. The debate-team members are also a distinctive group: Henry Lowe (Parker), an antsy scholar who wages a constant battle between his intellectual pursuits and his tumultuous instincts; Samantha Booke (Smollett), who is not only the first black student to enter these debates but the first female black student, as well; and James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker � no relation to Forest Whitaker, who plays his father, a daunting figure who is one of the South's few African-American Ph.D.s), who is younger than the others and experiences some of the period's harsher race lessons more intimately. (Farmer Jr. grows up  to found the groundbreaking antisegregation organization CORE.) The film follows a standard sports-movie structure in which the underdogs fight their way to success. But unlike a sports movie, the key to victory is education and knowledge, mastery of the speaker's lectern rather than a wicked right hook or jump shot. (Opens Tuesday, Dec. 25.)



Passion of both actors and their characters makes 'Debaters' a winner
"The Great Debaters" is like "Coach Carter," "Pride," "Akeelah and the Bee," and any other overlooked "young, gifted, and black" competition film. The difference is you'll probably see this one. Oprah Winfrey produced it. Denzel Washington directed it. Forest Whitaker acts in it. Oh, and it happens to be pretty good. The movie tells the true story of the Wiley College debate team, which in 1936 traveled from Texas to Cambridge to debate Harvard -- well, true-ish. The team never came to Cambridge for a debate. They went to the University of Southern California. In any case, according to the film, the team spent most of that season undefeated, and its stars during the �35-�36 season included the future Civil Rights leader James Farmer Jr., who at the time was a 14-year-old freshman.
Washington plays Melvin Tolson, the modernist poet, activist, and columnist, Wiley's speech and English professor, and the debate team's coach. The director shrewdly uses himself as audience bait. Posters for the movie have him in a suit pointing mid-lecture, and the film delivers him as a guiding Hollywood light: He's pure, inspirational Poitier. Professor Tolson extols the poetry of Langston Hughes and Gwendolyn Bennett. He writes the word "revolution" on his chalkboard before explaining the Harlem Renaissance to his students.
In the opening sequences, Washington quickly illustrates the movie's social-moral dichotomies, as it cuts back and forth between a jumping juke joint and a volcanic church sermon. But "The Great Debaters" is a didactic movie with a major tutorial difference. It exists in the rarified educational space between those two settings. The kids in Tolson's classroom, as well as the young lady and three young men who fill out the Wiley debate team, really want to be there. Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), the handsome hothead, knows where the juke joints are. James (the amazingly named Denzel Whitaker, who's related to neither star) knows where the church is - his daddy (Forest Whitaker) is a preacher. School becomes both kids' common ground.
This isn't a typical movie about outsiders who don't believe in themselves and have to be seduced into success. They know a lot and hunger to learn more. This is the pre-civil rights segregated South. If you were black and sitting in a classroom, your desk was your pew and your teacher was your preacher. Tolson might go too far in insisting he write the arguments for the team. But when Henry abandons script in one debate, it's obvious that he can not only think for himself, he can do it electrically.
The movie's first hour is patchy. It tries to get too much done with the dramatic cliches it has. There's a lot of business between young James and his steeply educated father. Some of the scenes are good. Some of them, like one involving the nasty rednecks whose hog the Farmers hit with their car (Kimberly Elise plays Mrs. Farmer), are labored attempts to articulate how racism restructures the power dynamic among the classes.
Robert Eisele's script takes the long way to get to the heart of the movie's matter, which is the simmering bond among the debaters. When one kid drops out because of the rumors of communism swirling around Tolson (by night the professor dons farmer's drag to negotiate unionization between white and black sharecroppers), the quartet reconfigures into a fascinating triangle. Intellectually, it's equilateral. Romantically, it's askew. Henry and James are smitten with Samantha (Jurnee Smollett), the fieriest orator on the team. She chooses Henry, and James, who serves as both the team's alternate and researcher, braces himself for real heartbreak. (He's a self-professed fan of D.H. Lawrence, so it's not as though he doesn't know what he's missing.) But Washington does give James a daydream where he and Samantha bounce and swing with each other to a big band at the homecoming dance. This is an ecstatic piece of musical moviemaking.
The other movie Washington directed, "Antwone Fisher," about a psychologically traumatized naval cadet, introduced the world to Derek Luke. This movie showcases Parker, young Whitaker, and, best of all, Smollett, who was the Eve in Kasi Lemmons's "Eve's Bayou." The girl in that movie has become a fearsome woman who commands your attention with the uncanny wisdom that seems to come from a place she doesn't quite understand.
"Antwone Fisher" was more unassumingly powerful than this new movie, which is overloaded. I didn't mention the lynching scene, the admittedly delightful sight of Forest Whitaker debating Denzel Washington, some last-minute romantic melodrama, and a real slap that your cheek will feel for days. The movie wants to do a lot and say even more. But what you truly remember are the awe and surprise on the debaters' faces when they win a debate or the expectant look they have the first time they enter a hallowed Harvard auditorium: We belong here, too. For a film about the power of speech, it's the quiet moments of rapture that say everything.


         Opponents found it easy to underestimate the 1930s debate team of Wiley College, a small, all-black institution in a remote corner of Texas, but they did so at their peril. The same will likely hold true for those who underestimate the new film on the Wiley phenomenon, "The Great Debaters."
 
 Because it is so old-school Hollywood, with a weakness for standard moments and pat situations, "The Great Debaters" initially comes off as easily dismissible. Largely saving it from that fate is the presence and ability of Denzel Washington, who costars with Forest Whitaker and directs from Robert Eisele's script. Working hard on both sides of the camera, Washington has grafted his intensity onto this production, giving it a kind of backbone it would not otherwise have.
 


         






   Though some of the key characters in "Debaters" are composites and some of the debates it features likely never took place, the essential story of the film is both remarkable and true. Under the leadership of a professor named Melvin B. Tolson, later a well-known poet, Wiley did take the college debating world by storm during the 1930s despite its small size and the pervasive racism of the day. Though it's not in the film, Wiley even defeated mighty USC in 1935.
 
 Washington plays Tolson, and his first classroom appearance is striking. He strides into the room, leaps up onto a table and recites the first few "I am the darker brother" lines from Langston Hughes' "I, Too, Sing America." In period clothes and hairdo, Washington not only looks the academic part, he brings an intriguing air of danger to the role of a firebrand who is determined to advance social justice in both the classroom and society at large.
 
 Tolson is especially passionate about debate, which he considers to be "blood sport." He's fussy about whom he picks for his four-person team and has his own mind-game techniques for turning them into winners.
 
 "The Great Debaters" focuses on the year 1935 and three Tolson debaters, two of whom are frankly composites, though inspired by real Wiley students. Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett) has transferred to Wiley with the hopes of being the school's first female debater. Free spirit Henry Lowe (Nate Parker) is smart and fearless, but he's not sure he wants to debate or even be in college at all.
 
 The third student is based on a real person, James Farmer Jr., who went on to found the Congress of Race Equality in 1942 and be a key player in the civil rights movement.
 
 In "Debaters," we meet Farmer,  played by Denzel Whitaker (no relation) when he is the youngest debater on the team, all of 14 years of age. His teenage crush on Miss Booke is one of the film's more schematic elements, but his conflicts with his learned father, the college's president (the quietly powerful Forest Whitaker), are considerably more substantial.
 
 Also unexpectedly powerful are the places and times when the Wiley students and faculty have to confront the pervasive racism of the day, whether it's stumbling on a lynching or having to endure humiliation at the hands of mulish white people.
 
 Because the real-life Tolson was also an organizer for the Southern Tenant Farmers Union, the film also throws a bracing whiff of Depression-era class warfare at the audience.
 
 It is "The Great Debaters' " unwillingness to downplay the harsh reality of prejudice that gives this film its authenticity. These scenes and moments may have been seen before, but they are presented with real fierceness, as are the debates themselves. It can be a shock to realize at moments that the issues that plagued America 70 years ago are still very much with us today.
 

 
 "The Great Debaters." MPAA rating: PG-13 for depictions of strong thematic material, including violence and disturbing images, and for language and brief sexuality. Running time: 2 hours, 3 minutes. In general release.   

 Its steadfast humanity, its literacy, its passionate belief in education, its faith that history teaches invaluable lessons and its strong, emotionally grounded performances: There are enough things to admire about “The Great Debaters,” the heavily fictionalized true story of The Little Debate Team That Could, that your impulse is to forgive the movie its shortcomings.  The second film directed by Denzel Washington, “The Great Debaters” may not aspire to be more than inspirational pop entertainment in the Oprah Winfrey mode (Ms. Winfrey is one of its producers), but unlike so many films of its ilk,  it doesn’t insult your intelligence. And it reminds you that social history airbrushed for the screen by Hollywood is preferable to none at all. Despite its cosmetic embellishments, “The Great Debaters” obviously emanates from the heart. It makes you nostalgic for prototypes like Stanley Kramer’s socially conscious message movies of the 1950s and ’60s and for the era that produced them.  As an enduring American myth, the triumph of the sanctified underdog, an intrepid spirit who doesn’t compromise his integrity on the slippery path to victory, may be much the worse for wear in these Darwinian times, but it can still produce a lump in your throat. The real tale  of the unlikely ascendance  of the debate team at Wiley College, a small all-black institution in Marshall, Tex., in 1935, follows the template of countless sports movies. Perseverance and teamwork lead to untarnished glory.  In its tone, though not in its content, “The Great Debaters” is the sequel to Mr. Washington’s 2002 directorial debut, “Antwone Fisher,” in which he played a Navy psychiatrist whose tough love helps save a broken soul. Here he portrays the noted poet, social activist and educator Melvin B. Tolson, who coached the Wiley College team. Righteous, autocratic and fearless, Mr. Washington’s Tolson is a screen descendant of the stern East London schoolteacher played by Sidney Poitier 40 years ago in “To Sir, With Love.” If Mr. Washington’s two films are considerably richer in content than that civil rights-era weepie, at heart they are no less sentimental.  Tolson is not only a ferocious coach but also a political firebrand (there are mutterings about his being a Communist) who runs afoul of the local sheriff (John Heard) for his organizing of the mixed-race Southern Tenant Farmers  Union. But whether Tolson is teaching or organizing, Mr. Washington imbues him with the authority of a persuasive orator and a moral Rock of Gibraltar.  “The Great Debaters” is aware that debating, an activity synonymous with nerdiness, needs a shot of adrenaline to be sexy to a mass audience. Early in the movie Tolson barks with the ferocity of a Marine Corps drill instructor, “Debate is a blood sport.” As the team starts winning, his severity never diminishes. The debates themselves are swiftly edited compendiums of best-of moments.  The four teammates handpicked by Tolson are Henry Lowe (Nate Parker), a handsome,  clean-cut youth with a lurking bad-boy streak; Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams), a dutiful eager beaver whose family pressures him to drop out when Tolson’s radical political organizing comes to light; Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), a strait-laced aspiring lawyer and soft-edged proto-feminist; and James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker), a preacher’s son whose father (Forest Whitaker) keeps him on a tight leash.  Despite his name, the actor playing James Jr. is unrelated to either Mr. Washington or to Forest Whitaker. It is worth noting that the senior Farmer was the first African-American in Texas to earn a doctorate. His son, a leader of the civil-rights movement in the 1950s and ’60s, founded the Congress of Racial Equality.  This being Hollywood, a soupçon of romance is required. The movie dawdles only as long as necessary on the pudgy, cow-eyed young James’s hopeless infatuation with Samantha, who becomes romantically involved with Henry.  “The Great Debaters” doesn’t shy away from showing the humiliation and persecution of blacks in the Jim Crow South. When James Farmer Sr., accompanied by his family, accidentally runs over a pig, his humiliation at the hands of the owner and his redneck buddies makes your stomach turn.  Later, Tolson, driving home from a debate with his students, comes upon a lynching. The flashes of the hideous atrocity sear your mind, and when the mob, still riled with blood lust, chases the car, your heart is in your throat. Afterward, Henry’s shame and stifled fury drive him to a self-destructive spree.  Robert Eisele’s screenplay imagines a smooth historical arc. The characters’ reactions to these events, it implies, sow the seeds of the civil-rights movement, which is also foreshadowed in the debates, whose topics too conveniently address civil-rights issues. Strangely, the Wiley College team always argues the progressive view. Its initial push to break the color barrier in college debating by competing with a white college in Oklahoma is too neatly paralleled by the debate topic: whether blacks should be allowed to attend state universities. A more intellectually subtle, less manipulative movie would have had the Wiley team arguing at least once against African-American interests.  Even though the film makes it clear that the team’s speeches are prepared in advance by Tolson, the literary and historical references blithely tossed around by the team members show astounding erudition, and their speaking voices carry only the tiniest hint of an East Texas twang.  For dramatic purposes the setting of the climactic debate has been changed in the movie to Harvard from the University of Southern California, where it actually took place. Again the issue is too neatly selected: nonviolent civil disobedience versus the rule of law.  The wonder is that “The Great Debaters” transcends its own simplifying  and manipulative ploys; it radiates nobility of spirit.    “The Great Debaters”  is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has mild sexual situations and some strong language.

Tailor-made for maximum inspirational, historical and educational impact, "The Great Debaters" shines a bright spotlight on a remarkable example of black achievement long forgotten in the sorry history of the Jim Crow South. Structured just like the many hackneyed-yet-stirring underdog-that-could sports movies produced over the years, Denzel Washington's second bigscreen directorial outing plainly and clearly relates how the debate team from tiny, all-black Wiley College in East Texas rose during the Depression to take on all comers, concluding with the vaunted Harvard squad. Pic's emotional appeal is significant, as is its commercial potential, especially with Washington, producer Oprah Winfrey and the Weinsteins presumably set to work overtime to promote it.
Despite the heavily fictionalized nature of Robert Eisele's script -- numerous characters are composites and no independent documentary evidence has been found that Wiley ever faced off against Harvard in 1935 -- "The Great Debaters" is first and foremost a history lesson, albeit of the most accessible, formulaic and Stanley Kramer-like variety.
Very much in line with recognizable Winfrey mandates, the picture promotes literacy and articulateness, highlights the significant oral tradition in black storytelling, crams in as many factual details and statistics as time will allow, and depicts a society that, however impoverished and oppressed, valued knowledge and education. Above all, pic illustrates that the civil rights movement didn't just spring out of nowhere in the 1960s, but was preceded by nearly a century's worth of innumerable small, brave, mostly unknown steps.
As agenda-driven and well-scrubbed as the film may be, that's already a lot to pack into a straightforward narrative and doesn't even include the story's most unexpected sidelight -- the implication that the revered English teacher and intellectually incisive debate coach, the real-life Melvin B. Tolson (played by Washington), was a radical labor organizer and possible communist.
The first notable element for contempo audiences is how well-dressed, polite and well-spoken everyone onscreen is; the era's profound deprivations notwithstanding, the constant supply of freshly cleaned clothes is impressive. Even more striking is how the rural students -- who, when they debate, wear tuxedos -- toss off Latin phrases and quotations from James Joyce and D.H. Lawrence with the casual insouciance of Oxford lads. Who knew?
Conducting tryouts at Wiley, pipe-smoking, sharp-tongued Tolson winnows out his prospects with the warning that "Debate is blood sport" and quickly settles on his team of four: the earnest, hard-working Hamilton Burgess (Jermaine Williams); smart, handsome ladies' man Henry Lowe (Nate Parker); pudgy and studious 14-year-old James Farmer Jr. (Denzel Whitaker, quite the name in these circumstances), and, to everyone's surprise, Samantha Booke (Jurnee Smollett), the rare female debater and aspiring lawyer in a state bereft of both.
While Tolson drills his charges, the pervasive racism is dramatized by a confrontation in which James' impeccable scholar father (Forest Whitaker) is threatened by rednecks whose pig he has accidentally run over. Incident is echoed and amplified later when Tolson and his team, driving at night on their way to a debate, witness the immediate aftermath of a lynching and barely escape the same fate themselves, an experience that subsequently fuels the climactic Harvard debate.
Tolson's secret extracurricular activities trying to organize white and black sharecroppers introduce an intriguing dimension that isn't developed sufficiently to pay off, particularly since the consequences are muddled. The lynching aside, the dynamics of relations between the races, as well as the abject poverty of the region and the difficulty of life in general, are superficially treated; the illiterate, unwashed masses on both sides of the color divide are largely invisible here, as is any sense of the larger community, the presence of the church in black life and that of institutionalized bigotry with teeth.
But for all the film lacks in realism and psychological depth, the sheer spirit of the enterprise sweeps the audience along, investing it wholeheartedly in what the long-shot crew is undertaking. Once they start debating, they find they have been very well prepared by Tolson.
So does their reputation grow that they are invited to go up against a white school in Oklahoma. The subject of this debate -- whether blacks should be allowed to attend state universities -- is purposefully selected to provide an airing of issues and attitudes controversial at the time that now appear self-evident. Dramatically, it would have proven more interesting if the Wiley team had occasionally been forced to argue against a view it would be expected to endorse -- debaters, after all, must be prepared to speak to either side of a topic -- but the debate scenes overall are invigorating and refreshing in the way they show students mentally engaged in the specifics and nuances, and not just the emotions, of current events, and able to articulate them within a rigorous format.
The contrast between this and the rancorous tone of present-day political discourse will not be lost on many viewers, and one suspects a covert ambition among the filmmakers is to revive the popularity of debate at schools today. When the awestruck youngsters from the Texas boonies are finally welcomed within the hallowed halls of Harvard (the climactic battle of words was actually shot at the impressive Sanders Theater in Memorial Hall), it's as if a college squad has been invited to play the home team at Yankee Stadium.
Script touches only lightly on what the central individuals are really going through in the course of their quick but far-reaching journey, leaving the film with a collection of highly sympathetic one-dimensional characters. As a director, Washington allows his actor self room for more than a little scene-stealing -- his way of wryly referring to whites as "Anglo-Saxons" is particularly disarming -- and he and Forest Whitaker both step up their game in their one big scene together, a spirited argument at a polite social gathering.
But the helmer, whose 2002 directing debut, "Antwone Fisher," took a similarly soft-edged but heartfelt approach to the possibilities of fulfilling youthful potential, is again generous with his young thesps, all of whom make a favorable impression. A tentative romance temporarily flares between Henry and Samantha, providing Parker and Smollett with a few moments unrelated to the issues at hand, and both are sure to be heard from in future. The inner life of Denzel Whitaker's barely pubescent James Jr. is dominated by his unrequited crush on Samantha, and the lad must also contend with his father's overly harsh strictures.
Budgetary restraints no doubt prevented a more fulsome portrait of community life, but pic looks good, with craft contributions pro all the way, and music, both original and period songs, provides a further boost.

First: Just register the laziness of that title. All right. The Inspiring True Story behind Great Debaters  is the 1930's championship streak of East Texas 's all-black Wiley College  debate team, coached by poet and teacher Melvin B. Tolson . This bit of historicity is the excuse for an educational tour of the re-created Jim Crow South, where students learn life lessons amid demonstrative orchestration. Denzel Washington , declaiming Langston Hughes  and professorially popping a pipe in and out of his mouth, plays Tolson with typical toothsome preening (Forest Whitaker  shows up as fellow Wiley faculty member, to remind the viewer what it's like not to be acted at ). Director Denzel is an adequate handler of cinematic gush and platitude, though, and even tries out a few snaky tracking shots and a compositional nod to Manet. That's about as surprising as things get; the film avoids potentially interesting frictions by always letting the team debate (and win) on the "correct" side of every issuethat which aligns with generally accepted modern liberal sympathies. The kids follow their party line all the way to the big game, a ridiculous, fallacy-riddled face-off against Harvard . Nobody gets to root for their teammates from a hospital bed, but I'll bet the idea was at least floated.
