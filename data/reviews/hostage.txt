Some will dismiss ''Hostage" as proof of Bruce Willis's fading box office luster. I prefer to think of it as retrenchment. A ''Die Hard" shrunk down to the domestic scale, it's a B-flick all the way, but it has no pretensions to the contrary, and that's some kind of refreshing.
Miramax and/or Willis himself have no faith in the film -- part of the company's pre-Disney-divorce burnoff, ''Hostage" was screened for critics only under duress and at the last moment -- but, for the life of me, I don't understand what they're ashamed about. Six months from now, it'll look fine on Cinemax at midnight.
Willis plays Jeff Talley, the best and craziest hostage negotiator in Los Angeles, at least until the movie's opening sequence, when it all goes kablooey in his heavily bearded face. Cut to a year later and Talley, shaven and visibly tamed, is chief of police in a tiny California town where nothing ever happens. Doesn't he ever go to the movies? Doesn't he realize that moving to Ventura County ensures that a major bloodbath will occur there?
First off, a trio of redneck teenage psychobillies led by hair-trigger Dennis (Jonathan Tucker) impulsively follow an SUV home to the mountaintop aerie of a man named Smith (Kevin Pollak), hoping to pull off a simple carjacking. But Murphy's Law applies to bad guys too, and the three are forced to tie up Smith's two kids, goth teen-babe Jennifer (Michelle Horn) and whiz-kid little brother Tommy (Jimmy Bennett). Then Mars (Ben Foster), the most homicidal of the three, shoots a policewoman, and the situation devolves into a hostage standoff, one which Chief Talley is happy to turn over to the big city boys.
But wait! There's more! Mr. Smith is the accountant for shadowy mobsters, and they need an incriminating DVD stashed somewhere on the premises. To cajole Talley into taking command of the negotiations, the mobsters kidnap his
 wife (Serena Scott Thomas) and teenage daughter (Rumer Willis).
Hold on a second -- is that
 why they didn't want critics to see ''Hostage"? Because the star's 16-year-old daughter is in it? Were they afraid we'd say rude things and Willis père would show up at the Globe and go medieval on us? Listen, I wish Rumer were on-screen long enough for me to say anything critical, pro or
 con. As it is, she has one convincing my-dad's-a-jerk scene and then spends the rest of the movie with a sack on her head. So you'd have to say the jury's still out on that one.
Director Florent Siri has reportedly shown some promise with French action films like 2001's ''The Nest," but here he proves an efficient, uninspired meat-and-potatoes moviemaker. The fun in ''Hostage" lies entirely in keeping track of all the marbles on the board -- Talley playing cops against crooks against other crooks, the teenage hoods in the house, the mysterious ubervillains, little Tommy Smith scampering through the heating ducts trying to save the day. The script is clever without ever being smart, the violence is showy but not cathartic, and the performances are, to put it kindly, a mixed bag.
The best is Tucker, the pride of Brookline's Park School, playing the kind of angry, antisocial loser who probably beat him up for lunch money during recess. The worst is Pollak, who seems embarrassed to have sunk to the level of genre pulp.
Here's what I like about Bruce Willis, though: He acts like this functional swill is as good as ''Pulp Fiction." The man's got exhausted capability down to a science. Yes, he's been playing variations on this role for going on two decades now, but he still hasn't started phoning it in, and I believe this is what is known as professionalism.
With any luck, Willis's turn in the upcoming ''Sin City" will finally bring the actor back into fashion. Not that I imagine he cares. ''Hostage," too, is unimpressed by its own trashy proficiency.


         Made with energetic flair and no small dose of violence, mercifully handled with discretion, "Hostage" exemplifies taut, confident filmmaking. Bruce Willis draws upon the full measure of his strong physical presence, his intelligence and his considerable emotional resources held in reserve.
 
  Under Florent Siri's authoritative direction, Willis holds together Doug Richardson's fiendishly clever script, based upon Robert Crais' novel, that tantalizingly teeters on the brink of improbability while keeping the viewer constantly on the edge of the seat.
 


         






    An expertly staged opening sequence reveals why Willis' Jeff Talley, the LAPD's prime hostage negotiator, winds up a year later the chief of police of a quiet Ventura County town. Three youths (Ben Foster, Jonathan Tucker and Marshall Allman) in a dingy red pickup truck ogle a pretty local girl (Michelle Horn) driving a Cadillac Escalade. She responds with the classic crude gesture of rejection — a bad idea, for the boys are more envious of her car and the wealth it represents than they are attracted to her. Horn's Jennifer lives in a highly fortified ultramodern mansion with her widowed father, Walter (Kevin Pollak), and younger brother, Tommy (Jimmy Bennett) — but its security is not so airtight that, led by Foster's clever and crazy Mars, the three youths are prevented from swooping down on the family and taking them hostage.
 
  In short, Talley is confronted with having to deal with the very situation he had hoped he had forever escaped. But "Hostage" almost immediately ups the ante for Talley to an excruciating degree, imposing upon him escalating pressure from two directions. Only a real movie star could hope to persuade a viewer that he could keep his cool under such tense and agonizing conditions, but Willis' credibility as a hero never falters — nor, just as important, does his humanity.
 
  Fraught with tension and intimations of the most hideous fate, "Hostage" uses the suspense it generates so furiously to reveal character under extreme duress and thus anchor its abundant thrills in some substance. Mars and Tucker's Dennis represent what can happen when their corrosive amorphous envy suddenly becomes focused, with the promise of a gratifying and lucrative release. (Allman's Kevin is essentially a decent kid sadly sandwiched between the psychopathic Mars and his insecure, reckless older brother, Dennis.)
 
  As the plot rapidly spirals, Bennett emerges as Willis' virtual costar. In Bennett's playing and in the film's writing, Bennett's Tommy emerges as a bright and brave boy without seeming insufferably or incredibly precocious for an 8-year-old. Horn and Pollak don't have as much screen time as Bennett but round out a wholly believable family placed in deep peril.
 
  "Hostage" packs plenty of surprises. Giovanni Fiore Coltellacci's cinematography has the dynamic flourishes essential to drive the film to its double-whammy finish and is complemented by Larry Fulton's striking production design and Alexandre Desplat's mood-enhancing score. "Hostage" marks another hit for Willis in a role that demands action and sensitivity and represents a knockout American debut for Siri, director of the acclaimed French thriller "The Nest."

Some years ago at the Cannes film festival, I watched Bruce Willis toss Planet Hollywood T-shirts to a crowd and bad-mouth France. Turns out he was backing the wrong horse. In Hostage , an interesting French action pic fights gallantly for dominance over a bulging, American-style shoot-'em-up. And while the Hollywood machinery eventually overpowers the sensibility of French-born director Florent Siri (The Nest ) in his first English-language production, the film's vaguely haunted, melancholic European sense of displacement does our Bruno good.
My new theory is that Willis' own aesthetic soul is more old-world than he knows, and that he works best with directors who either are (Luc Besson) or might as well be (M. Night Shyamalan) European. In Hostage , Willis plays Jeff Talley, a former LAPD negotiator whose desire for work in a sleepier county is blown by a trio of teens who break into a fancy house on the way to stealing a fancy car. From a case of Escalade envy, the doo-doo gets exponentially deeper: The owner (Kevin Pollak), who lives with his teenage daughter (Michelle Horn) and younger son (Jimmy Bennett), is a corrupt accountant who cooks the books for bad guys so shadowy, we never know what their exact brand of evil is.
And so while the three high-strung intruders, with their  individual cases of dangerous psychological instability, hold the family hostage, Talley's grimace is tightened a notch when he hears from the shadowy bad guys themselves: They're holding his own family at gunpoint until Talley retrieves a certain CD containing bank-account information more valuable to them than the life of the schlub who manages their portfolio. That Talley finds a way to do all of this believably enough, playing all sides against a constantly shifting middle, is the secret of Willis' longevity even after interest in Planet Hollywood has waned. (A different segment of the audience may be interested to see Six Feet Under 's Ben Foster as the creepiest of the intruders, and the star's own kid, Rumer Willis, as Talley's daughter.)
The movie, with its climax of boggling, bloody too-muchness, is adapted from Robert Crais' page-turner by Doug Richardson (Die Hard 2 ) with a businesslike sense of Willis' strengths. The cinematic tone, though, as well as the creation of an alluring, menacing, wealthy, and amoral California, is all Siri's. While the Hitchcock-loving cineast admires L.A., the wised-up middle-aged American movie star ought to mutter, ''Vive la France.''

ore than sad, it's slightly sickening to consider the technology, talent and know-how squandered on "Hostage," a pile of blood-soaked toxic waste dumped onto the screen in an attempt to salvage Bruce Willis's fading career as an action hero. His character, Jeff Talley, is a guilt-stricken former hostage negotiator for the Los Angeles Police Department doing penance in the sticks after a botched stakeout resulted in the death of a little boy. As the new chief of police in a low-crime Southern California town, Jeff has plenty of time to twiddle his thumbs and sulk about his troubled marriage. The star runs the gamut from hard-boiled to softhearted as he struts his familiar persona of the sensitive action hero and misty-eyed rescuer of tots. The movie, directed by Florent Siri, opens with the stakeout that undid Jeff. The old Jeff Talley was a swaggering hippie cop with thinning hair and an unsightly salt-and-pepper beard. The new, streamlined version has a shaved head that gleams like a torpedo and a buff torso the camera goes out of its way to ogle. Most of the action is set in and around the cliff-hugging Southern California mansion of Walter Smith (Kevin Pollak), a crooked, book-cooking corporate accountant with two children, who keeps his dirty secrets and offshore account numbers in a DVD of "Heaven Can Wait." Outfitted with video surveillance, searchlights, secret passageways and crashing steel gates that turn the place into a sealed bunker at the first sign of invasion, this architectural monstrosity is in dire need of demolition. And when Walter's pricey hellhole eventually succumbs to Molotov cocktails, your impulse is to cheer. But that's the only thing worth applauding in this senseless mess of a film. "Hostage" is so desperate to pack the most R-rated carnage it can squeeze into 113 minutes that it deploys two unrelated gangs to accomplish that destruction. After Walter's sassy daughter, Jennifer (Michelle Horn), gestures contemptuously at a carload of drooling teenage boys, this three-man answer to the Manson family visits her house planning to steal an S.U.V. But when the police arrive, the boys get jumpy and shoot a female officer to death. Jeff steps in around the time they demand a helicopter to transport them to safety. Meanwhile, a band of mysterious gangsters intent on getting that DVD kidnaps Jeff's wife and daughter and threatens to kill them unless he delivers the disc in person. The omniscient gang leader somehow knows all about Jeff's previous life. Rather than mesh, the two stories collide head-on. Because the film devotes more energy to the punks than to the gangsters, the kidnapping subplot feels like an afterthought crudely shoehorned into the movie. All it accomplishes is to further gum up an already clogged garbage disposal. As the teenagers panic, the craziest one, Mars (Ben Foster), becomes the movie's designated nut case, slaughtering and setting fire to everyone and everything in sight. It's sad to see Mr. Foster, who plays Russell, the flaky art student on HBO's "Six Feet Under," reduced to emptying his skimpy arsenal of psychopathic shtick. Ever since "The Sixth Sense," Mr. Willis has been the best on-screen buddy and surrogate dad a lonely little boy could ever want. Here the star is given two on whom to work his daddy magic. The first one dies, but the second, Walter's young son, Tommy (Jimmy Bennett), is a resourceful little bundle of courage, whose pluck and obedience to Jeff's life-saving instructions deserve several tear-stained merit badges. Under Jeff's tutelage, the scared little boy becomes a brave little man. "Hostage" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and gore.
"How can shit like this happen to the same guy twice?" was Bruce Willis 's lament in Die Hard 2 , which shouldered both its Xerox  plot and its body bags lightly thanks to a pervading air of jokey self-reflexivity. No such luck for the similarly repetition-compulsive Hostage , which stacks its corpses with the same baroque hysteria that Björk brought to the murder scene in Dancer in the Dark . Ex-SWAT Willis is a cocky longhair hostage negotiator in L.A. until a crisis slips from his grasp, leaving a mother and her son dead. No sooner has Willis shaved his head and moved to a PD in the sticks than three well-armed local teens attempt to steal an SUV and instead end up locked in a hyper-modern hilltop fortress with affectless accountant Kevin Pollak  and his two brats. Turns out Pollak has some nasty dealings with guys in balaclavas, who detain yet more innocents . . .
Bruce looks hot and underplays handsomely as always, but Hostage  is a steaming pile of siege clichés and screaming unlikelihoods. Much of the rescue strategy, for instance, hinges on the head captor never noticing that the younger kid is loose in the house, and the filmmakers scrabble desperately for a class subtext, pitting dirty-rich Pollak versus poor white trash, with Willis caught in the middle class. Once the craziest of the housejackersthe baleful spawn of a Crispin Glover -Trent Reznor  hatefuckgets a knife through the cheek and turns pyromaniacally love-lorn, Hostage  begins to evoke the notebook scrawlings of a trench-coat-mafia goon.
