There have been plenty of movies adapted from video games before, but "Hitman" may be the first one that actually feels like a computer wrote and directed it.
A spinoff of Eidos Interactive's successful third-person shooter series, in which a bald, black-suited assassin named Agent 47 calmly murders his way up a nefarious chain of command, the movie is almost completely generic - a Jason Bourne film with all the individual markings filed off. It moves fast and offers plenty of blam-blam without any reason why we should care.
Perhaps the problem is that the hero looks like Redi Kilowatt disguised as one of the Men in Black. Trained from childhood by the shadowy Organization, Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant) is not only shaved bald but has a Universal Product Code tattooed on the back of his head, the better to keep tabs on his freshness date, I guess. All the Organization's killer elite look the same. These guys don't exactly blend.
"Hitman" is the sort of movie that gives us datelines like "London . . . England," just in case the target audience isn't sure where London is. Most of the action takes place in St. Petersburg (. . . Russia), where 47 has been dispatched to assassinate Federation president Mikhail Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen). The hit goes awry and 47 is scheduled for extinction next. All that stands between him and the loss of his benefits package is Nika (Olga Kurylenko), Belicoff's slatternly mistress. A love interest? Perhaps, although 47's idea of romantic chitchat is "Shut up, or I'll put you back in the trunk."
"Hitman" might have worked as a tough, nihilistic B-movie about a soulless killer learning how to feel. Kurylenko has a sleazy charisma - 1950s film noir buffs will understand when I say she gives good Marie Windsor - and Dougray Scott gets a few nice scenes as the Interpol cop on 47's tail. Under Xavier Gens's direction, the punch-ups are over-edited but effective, and there's a four-way sword fight in a cramped train compartment that's fairly impressive, if nowhere near as lunatic as what Tarantino might have made of it.
The problem with "Hitman," aside from its near-total predictability, is the central miscasting. Olyphant just doesn't have the inarguable dramatic heft for this kind of role: He's too young, too high-voiced, with eyes that quiver too early in the game. The part needs a Jason Statham or Clive Owen - someone whose nihilism has a bottom and some flavors to it, like a good Scotch. Olyphant, by contrast, seems like a boy sent to do a man's work. If this actually were a video game, he'd be toast before Level Two, and you'd be throwing your joystick across the room in disgust.


''How does a good man decide when to kill?'' asks Timothy Olyphant's killer-for-hire protagonist in the opening minutes of Hitman . But we have a better question for you, Timothy Olyphant: ''How does such a good actor wind up in this witless piece of action schlock?'' Based on a videogame, Hitman  could be the year's dumbest movie, thanks to an idiotic premise concerning a group of secretive assassins identifiable only  only?   by the large bar-code tattoos on the backs of their shaved noggins.

 Based on the video game franchise of the same title, “Hitman” exploits every action-flick cliché imaginable and still manages to be dull. It’s bang, boom, blah — action movies for bored dummies.  A strangely, at times ridiculously, miscast Timothy Olyphant stars as the titular contract killer, who has been raised by some monastic-looking male order to travel the world in bloody business class, from Africa to Europe to Russia with hate. He’s a globe-trotting unholy man, a messianic messenger of murder. He’s also bald, has a bar code tattooed on the back of his head and is known only as 47. Women leave him cold (if vaguely rattled), which probably comes as a relief to the movie’s presumptive adolescent male target audience.  There’s a hodgepodge story from the screenwriter Skip Woods, though its details are sufficiently uninteresting to the director, Xavier Gens, as to make them uninteresting to anyone watching (or reading about) this mess. In “Hitman,” Mr. Gens, whose feature debut, “Frontière(s),” earned legitimacy by playing at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival, lavishes his attention on blowing stuff up, including dozens upon dozens of people. Life is always cheap in the exploitation racket, but it’s still tiresome watching one after another anonymous extra get a sizable hole blown through his body, to watch movie blood spray like water amid chunks of fake body bits, especially when there’s no story to speak of, no decent acting, no wit, no point.  Well, there is a point, which is to reel an audience in with an entertaining spectacle of death. In this regard, Mr. Gens fails, despite owing a visual and thematic debt to Luc Besson, whose company helped produce this junk. There’s loads of noisy violence and R-rated gore in “Hitman,” along with the regulation female nudity (via Olga Kurylenko), but these flashy parts never cohere or gather momentum.  Rather, Mr. Olyphant’s robotic assassin moves through corridors in effective mimicry of a familiar video game visual strategy, pausing every so often to peer through a gun scope, stare at the pulsing lights on his laptop or brutally dispatch one more generic human obstacle. On occasion, the story shifts to Dougray Scott, whose indifferent turn as an Interpol agent chasing after 47 nicely mirrored my own reaction to the on-screen din.  “Hitman” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Gore galore.

"Hitman" is a Eurotrashy vidgame knockoff that misses its target by a mile. Numbingly unthrilling as it lurches from one violent encounter to another, the pic's dark roots in an electronic, non-dramatic medium are plain to see, and unsuspecting gamers lured to theaters will soon wish they were back home participating in the action themselves. Theatrical playoff will be so quick that the DVD could serve as a stocking stuffer.
Most cinematically arresting minutes of the film, which shows the stylistic influence of the Luc Besson-affiliated co-producing shingle EuroCorp, are the gauzily ethereal opening credits, as boys are programmed to become assassins by what looks like a combo of the Roman Catholic Church and organized crime, all to the accompaniment of "Ave Maria."
Offshoot in question of this unholy alliance is Agent 47 (Timothy Olyphant), an unerring killing machine who obeys instructions announced to him, "Mission: Impossible"-style, via a computer of uncertain origin.
In this instance, our protag is sent to Russia to assassinate the head of state, Belicoff (Ulrich Thomsen), which he appears to do, only to have the matter confused by the existence of presidential doubles. The spectacular public hit naturally arouses the interest of the local intelligence org FSB, the CIA and Interpol, with the latter having dispatched no-nonsense agent Mike Whittier (Dougray Scott) to reel in the elusive culprit.
Anyone who brushes too close to Agent 47 seems to wind up on the wrong end of one of his many weapons, with the exception of punky Russian hooker and presidential g.f. Nika (Olga Kurylenko), whose mere presence and periodic come-ons seem to get slightly under 47's well-shaved and barcoded scalp. Nika's numerous comings and goings make little dramatic sense in the script by Skip Woods ("Swordfish"), although little else does either.
French helmer Xavier Gens, whose previous feature was the grungy torture-porn fest item "Frontiere(s)," positively swills in the moldy, drippy, bloodstained Russian ambiance conjured up on Bulgarian locations. But he shows no ability to develop a narrative line or even tension within a scene, an egregious failing in that lives are constantly at stake. Action sequences, particularly one in which 47 alternately takes on four assailants with guns, swords and martial-arts smarts, are often incoherently staged and feature familiar sped-up, herky-jerky cutting mannerisms.
Olyphant has good hair, so it's a shame he must do without it here as a man designed to be an automaton. He's also an actor capable of portraying subtle ambiguities and thought, which suggests he ought to branch out to play something other than baddies, as he also did in "Live Free or Die Hard." Presence here of Vin Diesel as an exec producer tips off that he at one time eyed this as a starring vehicle.
Kurylenko has a saucy, somewhat Anna Karina-ish appeal once her character softens into friskiness and vulnerability. Extensive second-unit work extends the locations to South Africa, Turkey, Russian and the U.K.
