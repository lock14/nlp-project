"License to Wed " is the sort of comedy that ends with a blooper reel. It's there just to assure you that no matter how torturous it was for you to watch, this was a pretty fun movie to make. I've always found that silly -- very few good comedies end that way. It's like giving someone a house tour that ends in a storage locker: Here's all the nonsense we couldn't fit in. If unused spit takes, flubbed dialogue, and extra improvisation are so uproarious, why not give us 90 minutes of that?
"License to Wed" is tolerable for about five. Mandy Moore and John Krasinski play an engaged couple who want her priest (Robin Williams ) to preside over the ceremony. He agrees but recommends following his program designed to test their commitment to each other. What he does to them -- forbidding sex, bugging their apartment, provoking fights -- amounts to pre-conjugal terrorism. The moviemakers are going for the feel-good antagonism of "Meet the Parents " and "Meet the Fockers ." But at the very least that sort of abrasiveness needs a comic premise missing from this movie. Realistically, if your girlfriend's priest beans you in the nose with a baseball, wouldn't you tell her? Krasinski shrugs it off. This is the kind of movie where the offenses don't stick or escalate. The only thing building is our aggravation with these characters, especially Williams's.
He has some decent improvised lines that seem borrowed from that blooper reel. But he plays passive-aggressive manipulation with an avuncular righteousness that makes you wish the movie were a thriller, so Moore or Krasinski could throw him from a window. Moore isn't allowed to be more than sweet, though, as American comedies are wont to do to her and most women her age. That she might be funny has to be taken as an article of faith, since movies don't trust women to handle a joke unless it's on them. Is a character named Sadie Wilhelmina Jones capable of comedy , though?
Between them, only Krasinski gets to play the laughs. He's in the Ben Stiller role here. But he's not allowed Stiller's comic retribution -- or maybe he has no capacity for exasperation. He's much better as the wiseacre sales associate, Jim, on "The Office." The film's director, Ken Kwapis , is a TV veteran who's directed a handful of episodes of that show, but this movie makes you appreciate how the writing dictates the tone of "The Office." There's nothing he can do with a script so severely detached from comedy -- and reality.
This is the sort of lobotomized, condescendingly lazy movie that leaves you resentful of Hollywood. When a mechanical baby spitefully urinates in Krasinski's face, it's the only moment you can identity with anybody in "License to Wed." Bad movies get made all the time, but this one seems complacent about its badness. It's also prudish. Williams narrates the opening minutes, and right before Moore and Krasinski can get down to business, the movie interrupts. "You didn't think I was going to let you see that," Williams says, confirming almost instantly that the target audience for a comedy about a serious adult relationship is in the third grade.


         Robin Williams' career appears to have come full circle. As a breakout comedy star 30 years ago, he and his uniquely mercurial talent were a tough fit for filmmakers looking for appropriate projects. Now, in his mid-50s, the actor is once again being miscast on a regular basis.
 
 Following last year's "RV," in which he attempted to button down and channel Chevy Chase, comes the tedious "License to Wed," an uninspired comedy starring Mandy Moore and John Krasinski as a newly engaged couple forced to endure the premarital course taught by Williams' overbearing Rev. Frank in order to be married in his church.
 


         






   Life lessons give way to a series of matrimonial survival tests seemingly designed by the Bush administration and theoretically geared for laughs.
 
 Directed by Ken Kwapis with a screenplay credited to Kim Barker, Tim Rasmussen and Vince Di Meglio from a story by Barker and Wayne Lloyd, the movie is a pastiche of tortured slapstick, groan-inducing dialogue and a lethal dose of treacle, apparently awaiting one of Williams' trademark sprees of riffing and vamping to save the day.
 
 That moment never comes, however. Spouting one-liners such as "Let's get the flock out of here," Williams churns through the movie in second gear.
 
 Even at reduced speed, Williams is Henny Youngman on amphetamines, a spiritual carny hawking abstinence and honesty to the young couple.
 
 Inexplicably passive-aggressive, the Rev. Frank underhandedly provokes the couple into confrontations, bullying the laid-back Ben (Krasinski) and pushing the buttons of control freak Sadie (Moore).
 
 Considering that over-the-line surveillance, manipulation and humiliation are Frank's main tools in prepping the duo for their nuptials, the minister's popularity with his congregation is a little hard to swallow.
 
 Much of the creepiness that Williams perfected in dramatic turns in films such as "Insomnia" and "One Hour Photo" unfortunately persists here, sending Rev. Frank's icky factor off the charts. He doesn't so much look at Sadie as leer at her and, intentional or not, Frank suggests some of the less-flattering clerical stereotypes.
 
 That impression isn't helped by the ever-presence of an underage sidekick (a demonic Josh Flitter), part of a Ministers of Tomorrow program, who would appear to be even more sadistic than his mentor.
 
 With Williams' appearances in recent hits such as "Night at the Museum" and "Happy Feet" and his willingness to take risks in supporting roles, he's in no danger of being out of work, but you'd hope he'd pick better material than this.
 
 Moore and Krasinski fare only slightly better with their stock characters. Type-A personality Sadie frets over inane wedding details with her metrosexual best friend Carlisle (Eric Christian Olsen) and her freshly divorced (and bitter) sister, Lindsey (Christine Taylor), only realizing how dull Ben actually is when they begin to fight. Given the material, Moore is lucky to register two basic expressions,  love struck and petulant.
 
 Charitably dismissed by his future father-in-law (Peter Strauss) as "affable," Ben primarily serves as a veritable punching bag, the butt of most of the film's gags.
 
  Krasinski, who shows much sharper comedic chops on the TV series "The Office," comes across as a blander version of Ryan Reynolds.
 
 
 "License to Wed." MPAA rating: PG-13 for sexual humor and language. Running time: 1 hour, 26 minutes. In general release.   

Robin Williams, as License to Wed 's mischievous Reverend Frank, could have used a few more of the sort of zingers he had in Mrs. Doubtfire . Reverend Frank refuses to marry Ben (John Krasinski) and Sadie (Mandy Moore), a pair of ''men are from the flat screen TV department'' /''women are from the wedding boutique''  clichés, until they undergo his ''program,'' a series of tests designed to  reveal the awfulness they're in for. The creepy-faced robot twin babies are funny (for a while); the rest of the film is not. It's like Meet the Parents  with Dr. Phil as the officiant from hell.

 In “License to Wed,” Ben and Sadie, a perfectly nice-seeming, personality-free couple (John Krasinski and Mandy Moore), meet at a Starbucks, fall in love and decide to marry. I’m sure you’re as happy for them as I am. But wait. An obstacle lies between them and wedded bliss in the unctuous, smiling person of Robin Williams, who plays a minister with definite ideas about what it takes to make a marriage work.  What it takes is for Reverend Frank, as he is known, to harass, browbeat and humiliate the intendeds (Ben in particular) for three weeks, until they are ready to call it quits. Only if they can survive his brutal training course in matrimony — which starts with a bloody nose for the would-be groom and includes a hidden microphone in the bedroom and twin robot babies programmed to throw tantrums and soil diapers — will poor Sadie and Ben have what it takes to persevere till death do they part.  As for myself, I will confess that the only thing that kept me watching “License to Wed” until the end (apart from being paid to do so) was the faith, perhaps misplaced, that I will not see a worse movie this year. Come to think of it, the picture might be useful in certain circumstances, much in the way that Reverend Frank’s training program is supposed to be.  If the beloved with whom you see “License to Wed” can’t stop talking about how great it was, you might want to cancel the nuptials. Or, if it’s too late for that, call a lawyer.  Slickly directed by Ken Kwapis from an incoherent and derivative script by  writers whose anonymity it may be kinder to protect, “License” contains not a single emotionally credible or comically revealing moment. Instead it is a fabric of clichés, from Ben’s best buddy, Joel (DeRay Davis),  whom marriage and fatherhood have rendered completely stupid, to Carlisle (Eric Christian Olsen), Sadie’s metrosexual confidant and a pale approximation of the character played by Owen Wilson in “Meet the Parents.”  Also in the background are Christine Taylor, doing her best in a nastily conceived role as Sadie’s bitter, boozy, divorced older sister, and Josh Flitter as Reverend Frank’s young sidekick. Young Mr. Flitter, the designated irritant in “Nancy Drew,” here does his utmost to prevent Mr. Williams from being the most annoying person in the movie. Remarkably, he succeeds, since Mr. Williams shows impressive restraint (or perhaps just fatigue) when it comes to breaking out the funny accents and rapid-fire non sequiturs.  The terribleness of “License to Wed” is not really Mr. Williams’s fault, in any case. A job is a job. But it is sometimes hard to tell whether Reverend Frank is meant to be one of his creepy, villainous performances (as in “One Hour Photo” or “Insomnia”) or to belong in his much larger gallery of twinkly, warmhearted menschen.  Here is a clergyman (Frank’s high-churchy denomination is not specified, maybe for fear of protests) whose only companion, day and night, seems to be a prepubescent boy. (“Reverend Frank is everywhere,” the youngster marvels. Ick.) The good pastor seems a bit too eager to ask “our little Stacy” what she likes to do in bed. He also launches into a mini-tirade at one point about Sadie’s supposed “liberal college” and “bisexual roommate.” Surely this  film is  a scabrous, cynical satire of religious authority run amok.  Surely not. It is only the latest attempt by a Hollywood studio to pander to prurience and piety in a single gesture, and to avoid giving offense by treating all possible factions of the public equally, which is to say like idiots. Ben, quite reasonably objecting to Reverend Frank’s intrusiveness, is portrayed as selfish and clueless, while Sadie’s cheerful acceptance of the minister’s wisdom is evidence of her own. And Frank is  wrecking their happiness only for their own good, pretending (one guesses) to be a vile caricature conjured from a cesspool of atheist calumny in order to steer his lambs onto the path of righteousness and decency.  And so, by the end, Sadie and Ben have been compelled toward some astonishing revelations: She is a bit of a control freak; he is kind of a slacker. They need to communicate better. By all means, let them. I think I’ve made myself clear enough.    “License to Wed” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some naughty talk and mild swearing.

Unleashing Robin Williams in the least flattering possible manner, "License to Wed" squanders the modest chemistry between its appealing central couple -- Mandy Moore and "The Office's" John Krasinski -- uniting its elements in an astonishingly flat romantic comedy, filled with perplexing choices. Tossed into the summer season, pic is at best a relatively harmless way to enjoy air conditioning for those who admire Williams' ability to riff, even at his most irritating; otherwise, Warner Bros. should see its theatrical stay quickly annulled.
Sadie (Moore) and Ben (Krasinski) meet cute at Starbucks, court and get engaged, all in the first 10 minutes. Giddily happy, they immediately consent when her blue-blood family insists the ceremony be performed by Rev. Frank (Williams), who forces the pair to fulfill an expedited "marriage preparation course" before marrying.
What transpires after that, alas, is a series of unfunny scenes that, as directed by Ken Kwapis ("The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants"), tend to drag on interminably. Inexplicably flanked at all times by an equally annoying young boy (Josh Flitter) who he's mentoring, Rev. Frank seemingly does everything he can to torpedo Sadie and Ben's relationship -- demanding they forgo sex, insisting (in perhaps the most inane sequence) they care for life-like robot babies and planting a bug in their apartment.
In some respects, the creepy-clergyman concept has the trappings of a horror movie, and strictly from a comedic perspective, this pretty much is. Although Kwapis has directed episodes of "The Office," and the movie does feature co-stars Mindy Kaling, Angela Kinsey and Brian Baumgartner in what amount to moral-support cameos for Krasinski's leading-man role, none of that program's subtle wit is apparent here. A good rule of thumb: When asking people to go out and see a truly dumb movie, it's best not to remind them there's a much funnier TV show they can watch at home for free.
The real disconnect ultimately lies in Rev. Frank, whom Williams invests with manic energy and lots of silly puns (as in "Let's get the flock out of here") without any sense of menace or motivation. Against that excess, Moore and Krasinski can do little more than look winsomely adorable and boyishly befuddled, respectively.
Tech credits and sets reflect the pic's modest aspirations, and the closing credits run an assortment of giggle-filled outtakes, suggesting a production that was apparently more fun to make than to watch. As the movie repeatedly stresses, a successful marriage is hard work, as is the serious business of producing a solid comedy. On that score, "License to Wed" does little more than make you yearn for another day at "The Office."

A blitzed-looking man stumbling out of a screening of this dreadful excuse for an unromantic comedy volunteered that the best part of the movie was when Robin Williams  got socked in the jaw. Couldn't agree morebut if you like your Williams spewing rat-a-tat gags and substituting stand-up for acting, you'll love him as an obsessive priest bearing down on a dewy-eyed engaged couple (Mandy Moore  and The Office 's John Krasinski) in Ken Kwapis's high-concept, low-minded riff on the current vogue for marriage-prep classes. Mistaking sadism for satire, sight gags for physical comedy, and stupidity for good nature, the movie has the Rev drive a wedge between the happy couple by spying on them, banning them from sex, and equipping them with animatronic babies emitting blue poopall designed to bring them the shocking news that weddings may be fun, but marriage is serious business. Moore, who made a great high school meanie in The Princess Diaries  and Saved! , is nothing more than a series of toothy reaction shots. The lone saving grace in this mean-spirited rubbish is Krasinski, serenely refusing to chew scenery with the rest.
