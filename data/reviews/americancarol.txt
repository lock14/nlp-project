Gag-loving farceur David Zucker  (Airplane!  ) flings grenades and rubber chickens in An American Carol  , a loony attack on wacko liberalism and a ding-dong defense of wacko conservatism. Only you can decide whether you're in the mood to wade through the smear of stink jokes and political ravings. Zucker uses A Christmas Carol   as a structure and the persona of baseball-capped filmmaker Michael Moore  (Kevin Farley) as a Scrooge in need of political re-education (and deodorant); George S. Patton (Kelsey Grammer ) helps him see the patriotic light. For veritas, Bill O&#39;Reilly  plays...a right-wing blowhard.
