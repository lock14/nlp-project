         In the 1972 film "Sleuth," a hammy chamber piece based on a play by Anthony Shaffer, a young hairdresser named Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) arrives at the costume- and prop-stuffed manse of aging crime novelist Andrew Wyke (played with cuckoo brio by Laurence Olivier), who greets him as "the man who wants to marry my wife." In the remake, Jude Law plays Tindle, and Caine, who plays Wyke, greets him as "the man who's . . . my wife." Tindle chokes on his Scotch but the gleam in his eye could light a stadium. "She's . . . me," he replies, with the mock disingenuousness of a smart-alecky fifth-grader. In this battle royal between sex and money, there's no trace of the initial decorum of the original, which  had Milo painfully lay out his humble origins and polish his bootstrap bona fides for Wyke's inspection. This time, the cat-and-mouse game is played by a couple of weasels. Which is a lot more like it.
 
 Directed by Kenneth Branagh from an updated script by Harold Pinter, the theatrics have been considerably toned down, and the action unfolds in a cooler, darker, more slinkily  malevolent place-- namely, the  concrete-and-laser-beam atrocity that is Wyke's country house. Milo is no longer a hairdresser (though Andrew keeps insisting he is) but an out-of-work actor specializing, as he says, in killers, sexual deviants and perverts. Wyke, for his part, is no longer an Agatha Christie type but the manly churner-outer of sleek, bestselling thrillers with titles like "Rat in a Trap."
 


         






   Set  within Wyke's lugubrious bunker, which is outfitted with more surveillance cameras than chairs, "Sleuth" has a tendency to let its theatrical underpinnings show. Things get a bit stagy, and the act reversals yield diminishing returns. The final twist in particular takes the movie in an interesting but unconvincing direction, not because it's not credible but because it hinges on reserves of trust and credulousness that characters this quick-witted and cynical would have thoroughly exhausted by then. Still, the verbal sparring is so sharp it's a wonder nobody loses an eye. Caine is infinitely more effective -- and appealing -- as the heavy-lidded python waiting for the moment to strike, and Law couldn't be more snide and slippery. Language this lethal has all but disappeared from the movies, and it's an unmitigated pleasure to observe Caine and Law attack it with such ferocity. "Sleuth" is nasty fun.
 


 
 "Sleuth." MPAA rating: R for strong language. Running time: 1 hour, 26 minutes. In limited release.   

When Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, in the 1972 screen version of Sleuth , indulged in their poison-tipped war of words and wit, setting traps that just opened up into further traps, it played as a feast of acting  or, at least, a feast of British hambone exhibitionism. I'm not sure if anyone needed a new version of Sleuth , yet here it is, with Anthony Shaffer's play retooled by Harold Pinter, and the whole thing set in a cobalt-blue fascist-designer mansion. It's like Deathtrap  crossed with Cribs  as staged by Stanley Kubrick.
In the new version, which has been directed by Kenneth Branagh with ripe theatrical malice, Caine, flashing those menacing choppers, takes over Olivier's role as the wealthy crime novelist who seeks revenge upon the man who stole his wife. Jude Law is the cuckolding scoundrel. Even with Pinter's salty upgrade (lines like ''You're the man who's f---ing my wife!''), the material seems stagier than ever. In the first section, which features nifty vertiginous top-down camera angles, it's obvious that Caine is setting a trap for Law, and when a runty policeman shows up to interrogate Caine about Law's disappearance, only the gullible will fail to pick up on why this cop smells a little fishy.
But give the new Sleuth  this: The two actors don't just feast  they tear and bite into the unctuous nastiness of their roles. Law, who in recent films has threatened to vanish inside the placidity of his coppery beauty, here shows a more reckless and dynamic side  a gigolo sleaziness that looks good on him. (He should call himself Lewd Jaw.) And Caine, a canny old lion, knows how to wrap each scene around the joyful snarl-and-pause of his rhythms. Pinter has added an explicit homoeroticism to the last phase of the duel, and it works nicely, not because this is really a sexual drama, but because the gay angle teases out the true theme of Sleuth . These two enemies are so addicted to their evil gamesmanship, to the grand artifice of theater , that they need each other even more than they hate each other. That's love, British hambone-style.

 If you like your contempt for humanity served overcooked and oozing fatty blobs of preening, lazy self-regard, you could not improve on Harold Pinter’s redo of the 1970 Anthony Shaffer play “Sleuth,” which Kenneth Branagh has used to remake the 1972 Joseph L. Mankiewicz film of the same title. (Got that?) The result is that what was once insignificant is now insufferable, though, at 86 minutes, almost an hour shorter.  Jude Law stars as Milo Tindle, a hairdresser and sometime actor who’s having an affair with the  wife of a famous novelist and full-time sadist, Andrew Wyke, played by Michael Caine. Milo is young, lovely and, because he’s played by the talented Mr. Law, a pleasant screen presence. Andrew is decades older, wattled and grooved and, because he’s played by the talented Mr. Caine, equally fun to watch, even when he’s as badly lighted as he often is here. Both are less pleasing to listen to, largely because they’ve been enlisted to enliven a story reeking of mothballs and sexual panic and designed to titillate the audience by putting its two lab rats into an electrified maze. Zap! Zap! Sizzle!  The new “Sleuth” film follows the general nasty arc of the 1972 screen version, which starred Mr. Caine as the bedroom interloper and Laurence Olivier as his wily match. Milo (inexplicably) visits Andrew’s estate; Andrew (unpersuasively) coaxes Milo into a crime; Milo (unbelievably) retaliates; and so it goes, amid much twisting and turning of the meta-variety sort.  “Tell me,” Andrew asks in Mr. Schaffer’s original play, “would you agree that the detective story is the normal recreation of noble minds?” Milo, or really the playwright, replies, “Perhaps it would have been truer to say that noble minds are the normal recreation of the detective story.” Mr. Pinter more or less recycles these lines, thereby erecting a bridge between him and Agatha Christie, whom, depending on your view, Mr. Shaffer either robbed or parodied.  This version of the film cuts out chunks of complication and inserts  surveillance cameras in and around Andrew’s manse, which adds screens within screens (some in green-hued night vision) though nothing of actual  thematic interest. The performers  tend to deliver the airless, self-consciously synthetic dialogue like untutored violinists dutifully sawing away to the steady tick-tock of a metronome. On occasion there’s a flourish of realism as one or the other approximates a human being rather than a dramatic contrivance. This happens infrequently, mostly when the two men  are raising their voices and intimately grappling with the story’s tiresome sexual dynamics, which suggest a link between sadism and homosexual desire. Here a brandished gun comes loaded with symbolic import, not just bullets.  Mr. Branagh can be a fine film actor, but at this point in his screen career it’s safe to say he has no feel or facility for cinema when he’s calling the shots behind the camera. Almost every setup looks wrong: poorly considered, awkwardly realized, ugly. (The cinematographer Haris Zambarloukos has done fine work elsewhere.) Mr. Branagh fiddles with the lights, tilts the camera and hustles his hard-working actors upstairs and down and back again and into an elevator as small as a coffin built for one. He embellishes the screenplay’s every obvious conceit and word, hammering the point until you feel as if you’re trapped inside the elevator with Milo and Andrew, going up and down and up and down,  though nowhere in particular.  “Sleuth” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has nasty language and fired guns.

The post-Agatha Christie teases and comforts provided by Anthony Shaffer's play "Sleuth," and Joseph L. Mankiewicz's 1972 film adaptation, have been morphed into a bizarrely contorted facsimile by screenwriter Harold Pinter and helmer Kenneth Branagh. New pic also happens to be titled "Sleuth," but those who know the original may wonder after awhile if their minds aren't playing tricks on them. The results will be received with a large, loud yawn by all but the most loyal fans of Pinter and hard-working co-stars Michael Caine and Jude Law, with vid holding a few profitable twists. 
Just as Shaffer intended to remodel the creaky Christie model of the English manor mystery into something a bit more au courant
 for the early '70s when it first appeared on the West End, so Pinter -- possibly the greatest living playwright in the English language -- apparently wished to remodel Shaffer's play. (In the press notes, Pinter says he had never read the play nor seen the film before starting his adaptation.)
Certainly, the original's sense of growing menace -- as rich, older mystery novelist Andrew Wyke (Caine) envelops young upstart Milo Tindle (Law) in a spider's web of a murder plot -- and overarching tilt into the absurd make this natural turf for Pinter. At the time that Shaffer's hugely successful two-hander appeared, it was noted by some that the play seemed to stand in two worlds -- Christie's, and Pinter's.
Immediately, though, this is a radically different "Sleuth," one that feels at times like Pinter self-parody. Milo arrives to meet Andrew at his estate, as recorded by surveillance cameras. Inside, what was once a deceptively inviting manor, stuffed with games and goofy devices, is now a metallic black box of minimalist interior design, so extreme it's impossible to accept that anyone could possibly live in it. If past movies suggested their bad guys through the severity of their ultra-modern furnishings, production designer Tim Harvey has taken this already threadbare idea to the edge and beyond.
Simply put, Milo's in love with Andrew's wife, and wants him to sign off on a divorce so they can carry on with their lives. Incidentally in this version, though enormously important to Shaffer, is Milo's Italian heritage and plebian identity, both of which Andrew holds in contempt. To grant Milo's wish, provide the young man with needed capital and cash in on a lucrative insurance claim in return, Andrew proposes a little game: Milo will stage a break-in and steal Andrew's wife's jewels.
Milo's early suspicions prove all too well-founded, and a seemingly dastardly act triggers some interest from the local constabulary, for which Andrew -- mystery author supreme -- isn't entirely prepared. Beyond this point, plot details are top-secret, and for a whole generation unfamiliar with Shaffer's work (due especially to the scarcity of the original pic on video), the game may prove mildly tingling.
While Pinter has often ingeniously deployed homoerotic subtext in his plays (and such films as "The Servant"), his strategy here is to make that subtext overt, so the parry and thrust of two hetero males over the same woman becomes a new game of sexual come-on by one toward the other. It isn't only that "Sleuth" is too slender a piece to bear the added weight but Pinter's inventions feel dramatically arbitrary, while jettisoning much that was fun in the original's second act.
Such a severe departure -- from the Spartan trimming of Shaffer's far wordier text to the substitution of a cube-shaped glass elevator and color-shifting ceiling lights in lieu of Andrew's eccentric creature comforts -- seems to be pic's entire purpose, making it hard to fathom why an entirely new work wasn't conceived instead of this strange rewriting of a modest commercial thriller.
The only dash of fun is left for those who know the Mankiewicz film, in which Caine plays a genuinely vulnerable, ladder-climbing Milo with smarts that are greatly underestimated by Andrew (Laurence Olivier). Now Caine is the older gent, and the switcheroo is pure putty in his ever-reliable hands, as he gives the text a fresh reading that at least slightly justifies the revisionism.
Law, on the other hand, is unconvincing, particularly in the latter half (where Caine's Milo was so surprising and engaging). Quite at home as the callow, out-of-work actor in the first half, Law feels increasingly ill at ease in what's fundamentally a Pinter play on camera, with no ear for the music of the playwright's precisely clipped yet real-sounding dialogue.
The same applies to Branagh, who has no eye for how to frame two bodies in stark, empty spaces; the recent loss of Michelangelo Antonioni is all the more felt. Visually dull production and uneasy editing by Neil Farrell make pic play much longer than its running time (nearly 45 minutes shorter than the original). Patrick Doyle's grinding score sounds like a poor substitute for suitably minimalist composers like Michael Nyman.

Kenneth Branagh 's ferociously arty, vacuous remake of Joseph L. Mankiewicz 's 1972 screen version of Anthony Shaffer 's 1970 stage play pares the action down to a slim two-hander in which a famous English writer (Michael Caine ) plays cat's paw with his wife's lover, a cocky arriviste played by that other Alfie, Jude Law . Handsomely appointed in gleaming glass and other fascist design accessories of the coldhearted super-rich (the writer's house looks as though it was shot in David Geffen 's mansion, with accessories by Escher), this tiresome rehash seems motivated by little more than the urge to bludgeon us with uppercase Cinema. Surveillance cameras rule, and verbal tennis ensues in clipped micro-clauses made over by screenwriter Harold Pinter , whose gift for terse opacity has rarely translated well onto the big screen. Whatever pleasure can be wrung from Sleuth  lies in the black comedy of Caine and Law's sinuous symbiosis. But Shaffer's tired bromides about the potency of wealth and cunning, and the supposedly primal struggle of two males more in love with one another than with the woman they seek to possess, remain in Branagh's hands little more than a pissing contest energized by crude homophobia and misogyny.
