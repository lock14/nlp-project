What would it take to draw people into a documentary about the post-9/11 world? Here are a few things that, by now, probably won't work: intricate layered craftsmanship; a spirit of inquiry; an excavation of the lies that have trickled down from the top levels of American power; a look at the devastation (torture, maimed soldiers, grieving families) on the ground; disturbing doses of information, outrage, truth. Nope, that's been done, and it hasn't gotten far. Enter Morgan Spurlock, who in Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?  tries a different tack. In his first film since Super Size Me , Spurlock tells you virtually nothing you didn't already know  and, what's more, he does it with catchy videogame graphics (Osama boogying to ''U Can't Touch This'') and faux-naive man-on-the-street interviews that make Michael Moore look like Chet Huntley. The movie, in other words, is so glib and shallow and facile it just might work at the box office.
Where in the World  isn't really about the hunt for bin Laden. Once you get past the title, it's little more than a feeble, once-over-lightly tour of the Middle East, as Spurlock  now an expectant daddy fretting over the state of the world  pays visits to Egypt, Morocco, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, trying to suss out the feelings of the citizens there. Did you know that the war in Iraq has been a boon to al-Qaeda? That a lot of folks in Arab Muslim countries have no beef with ordinary Americans but deplore our government? That Saudi Arabia limits freedoms on speech, women's dress, and religion? These and other shattering insights are offered up as if they were news; Spurlock's gaga investigative zeal makes him come off here like a boob who spends too much time at the health-food store and not enough time reading the papers. When a bunch of Hasidim on a Jerusalem sidewalk start yelling at him to go home, and he's forced to scurry for cover, his attitude is at once smug and starry-eyed, sealed with a Can't we all get along?  shrug. A primer no one needed, Where in the World Is Osama bin Laden?  should have been called The Post-9/11 World for Dummies .
In Standard Operating Procedure , the latest from Errol Morris (The Fog of War ), we see those grinning, thumbs-up American soldiers from the Abu Ghraib photographs  like Lynndie England  explain themselves with a potent sense of what was expected of them from the powers above: to ''soften up'' prisoners for the real  torture to follow. Morris, using a welter of photographs (many of which we haven't seen), constructs a day-to-day sense of how Abu Ghraib descended into a medieval hell. He reveals the institutionalized fear, the pornographic license that ruled a prison where degradation became the blinkered language of American payback. The most chilling thing about the film, however, is how hard it is to completely separate yourself from those guilty U.S. soldiers. Now who in the world would want to go see that? Where in the World:  C- ; Standard Operating Procedure: 

 Correction Appended  A blockbuster of a documentary, Errol Morris’s “Standard Operating Procedure” is an inquiry into the prisoner abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib. It is, predictably, a bleak, depressing movie, but if you stick around through the end credits, you may also be in for a few surprises. In addition to the usual complement of helpers — a research coordinator, a consultant on  Iraq — the credits mention a costume designer, a wardrobe stylist, six hair and makeup people, an action consultant, an armorer, 5 set dressers, 7  animal handlers, 10 prop makers, 33 cast members and Danny Elfman, the longtime composer for Tim Burton.  It’s an estimable roll call, all the more so when you compare it with the average documentary or even a modest fiction film. The very scale of “Standard Operating Procedure” — evident in its costly-looking production values, special effects and elaborately choreographed re-enactments — suggests that Mr. Morris has grown weary of working in the margins to which documentary filmmakers are still too often relegated. “Standard Operating Procedure” is a big, provocative and — it goes without saying — disturbing work, though what makes it most provocative is that its greatest ambitions are for its own visual style.  In broad strokes the documentary addresses issues surrounding state-sanctioned torture, the abnegation of government responsibility and what happens when certain young male and female soldiers are left to their own ill-informed devices. In a director’s statement Mr. Morris explains that one force driving the project was the mass of photographs taken by American soldiers at Abu Ghraib that document, often in horrifyingly explicit detail, the prisoner abuse that they helped perpetuate. He and his team “set out to examine the context of these photographs” in an attempt to uncover what had happened outside the frame. For him the photographs function as both an exposé and a cover-up because while they revealed the horror, they also “convinced journalists and readers they had seen everything.”  It is all too easy to imagine that there are journalists and readers who are convinced they have seen everything there is to see — or to know — about Abu Ghraib. But to judge from the book on Abu Ghraib he published after he helped break the story in The New Yorker in May 2004, the inexhaustible Seymour M. Hersh  doesn’t appear convinced. And there are other journalists who continue to cover the story, and readers who seek out more information about it, including through documentaries like “Standard Operating Procedure.” Mr. Morris certainly wasn’t convinced that he had seen everything; he made this movie, which, at its finest and most focused, seeks to examine how seeing does — and does not — become knowing.  To that end, Mr. Morris employs two familiar documentary strategies: direct-address interviews and re-enactments in which actors restage actual historical events. Although re-enactments tend to raise alarms, particularly by viewers who confuse documentaries with journalism, interviews are often more problematic precisely because they look so straightforward, even transparent. Mr. Morris, who paid some of the interviewees who appear in “Standard Operating Procedure” — an unusual if not unprecedented documentary occurrence — frames his subjects in head-and-shoulder close-ups, which more or less mimics the closeness of one-to-one, person-to-person conversation. This sense of intimacy is further enhanced by a device that Mr. Morris developed called the Interrotron, which allows interviewees to look at his video image while they are being filmed instead of at the camera, much as newscasters look at teleprompters.  As a strategy, talking-head interviews appear to allow documentary subjects to speak for themselves, to raise their own voices, as it were. But when the filmmaker remains unseen and unheard, these interviews also tend to obscure that someone is always shaping the conversation, moving it in certain directions. Mr. Morris shouts out a few questions during the interviews but otherwise remains off camera, his presence evident only in his stylistic signatures, his tight framing and his aggressive editing. (Distractingly, he tends to cut into even the shorter interviews, and because he often slightly changes the angle of the shots with each edit, the talking heads appear to shift from one side of the screen to the other.)  Some of those heads, including that of Janis Karpinski, the Army Reserve brigadier general in charge of military prisons in Iraq before the scandal broke, will look familiar, not least because they appear in Rory Kennedy’s informative 2007 documentary, “Ghosts of Abu Ghraib.” A fascinating screen presence whose spooky light eyes never seem to blink, Ms. Karpinski, who was demoted to colonel, is the highest-ranking officer to have been punished for her participation. And because she is also the highest-ranking officer in “Standard Operating Procedure,” she sounds particularly impressive, dropping two-star names and insider dope with authority. She makes a good witness, though it becomes clear that, much like everyone else who appears here, she is mostly testifying on her own behalf.  That’s fine as far as it goes, but the problem is that none of it — not the interviews, not the lurid re-enactments — really goes anywhere. There is some mild fascination (or satisfaction), perhaps, in seeing how badly Lynndie England — the grinning pixie who was photographed with a leashed, naked prisoner — has aged. Yet like all the other low-ranking soldiers caught up in this nightmare, Ms. England says next to nothing of interest, not only because she appears to have been a cog in a much larger military machine, but also because Mr. Morris’s approach here is profoundly nondialectic. He lets her talk and talk but doesn’t challenge or engage her beyond a question about her age. The night of one photo shoot, she turned 21.  That’s a heart-sickening detail, and it points to a central issue that Mr. Morris takes up though doesn’t explore in real depth, namely that a group of young soldiers committed crimes at the behest of their superiors. Mr. Hersh, among others, has voiced his opinions on who deserves blame, but beyond a throwaway image of President Bush, Mr. Morris himself remains basically silent on this crucial point. Instead he lets the soldiers state their case, tosses in some nifty special effects (the photos zip about nicely) and, with extraordinary meticulousness and to no real analytic purpose, restages some of the worst images, a rhetorical gesture that registers as an unfortunate attempt to trump the originals.  Mr. Morris has used re-enactments in the past, including in his 1988 breakthrough, “The Thin Blue Line.” But nothing he has done previously approaches the level of fetishistic detail he achieves here, whether he’s showing us beautifully backlighted dust motes dancing in the prison air or an exquisitely photographed pearl of blood dangling from a brutalized prisoner’s, or rather actor’s, nose. The close-ups of the snarling, barking guard dogs summon memories of Stephen King’s “Cujo,” which makes sense, given that Mr. Morris’s epistemological quest has led him to reimagine Abu Ghraib in the vernacular of a cheap Hollywood horror flick. If nothing else, the dogs and their trainers serve as a reminder that Mr. Morris is, in his own singular fashion, very much in the entertainment business.  “Standard Operating Procedure” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Explicit images of real torture and graphic re-enactments of the same.

If the medicine's going to taste as bad as it does in "Standard Operating Procedure," it had better be really good for you. But despite the coup of landing candid interviews with several of the Americans most intimately involved in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal, Errol Morris' first docu since "The Fog of War" adds relatively little insight to the public understanding of wayward military behavior more incisively analyzed in "Taxi to the Dark Side." Helmer's status and heavyweight subject matter will stir attention running up to April 18 domestic release, but the film is such a grind to sit through that a B.O. fate similar to that of other Iraq-themed releases seems inescapable. Smallscreen and home-format prospects are better.
Coming up on five years since the world was shocked by photos of naked Iraqi prisoners being humiliated, shackled, leashed and piled upon one another by young and often female American MPs, it's hard not to see the incident as one of many bungles perpetrated by a U.S. Army ill-prepared to handle post-Iraq invasion challenges. As Alex Gibney suggested in "Taxi," the lack of preparedness on the part of interrogators and prison personnel was likely a deliberate strategy by then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney to keep vague what was and was not permissible, thus tacitly opening the door to the sort of abuse that Morris brands with the title of his film.
Whereas "The Fog of War" dealt with the Vietnam War's prime architect, Robert McNamara, "Standard Operating Procedure" looks at the poor grunts at the bottom of the ladder -- specifically those who, as members of the 372nd Military Police Company, were assigned the hellish task of dealing with inmates at Saddam Hussein's notorious prison. Docu is bracing for its firsthand testimony. Morris managed to secure on-camera interviews with five of the seven MPs indicted for their actions at Abu Ghraib -- Megan Ambuhl, Javal Davis, Lynndie England, Sabrina Harman and Jeremy Sivitz. (The other two, Ivan Frederick and Charles Graner, were in prison.) That three of them are women is certainly notable, although England, the most recognizable of the bunch, maintains that all the women who ended up in the brig were there "because of a man."
In her case, the man was Graner; England became pregnant by him in Abu Ghraib, while Ambuhl is now married to the guy, who looks to have been the ringleader in many respects.
Pic's tone of anger and barely restrained outrage is set by another woman: Janis Karpinski, former brigadier general of the 800th Military Police Brigade in Iraq (to which the 372nd was attached), whoremains royally pissed off over having been made the scapegoat when none of her superiors were touched. General sentiment here is that, if they could do it all over again, they wouldn't have joined the military.
But Morris always has more complex and ambitious goals than straightforward personal confessions and historiography, something he typically aims for with a dense mix of visuals at the service of some heady intellectual notions. Here, his approach takes the form of as many Abu Ghraib photos and video snippets as anyone would ever want to see, mixed with sophisticated graphics, animation, re-creations and assorted other stimuli intended to augment the film's power.
Instead, the tactic backfires, coming off as unseemly. All the fancy style applied to the sordid military equivalent of basement videotapes, and further whipped into a lather by Danny Elfman's music, makes the proceedings feel far too melodramatic. A stark, matter-of-fact approach would seem all that's required when dealing with such powerful central images, but Morris detracts from them by placing them within his elaborate modernist frame.
The director also seems taken with one commentator's observation that, with the Abu Ghraib photos, "You don't see outside the frame." As Morris explores the issue, its truth is revealed in small, specific ways -- certain individuals were cropped out of photos later widely disseminated -- and in large, broader ones: One can't see the pressure created by what was going on outside and around the prison, nor, of course, who may have been issuing commands or pulling strings. Yes, Morris, suggests, the pawns on view here were guilty, but the people who fostered such behavior were smart enough not to be caught on camera. For all the finer intellectual points being made, however, "Standard Operating Procedure" is an almost continuously disagreeable sit, not even so much because of the images themselves, which will be more or less familiar to many, but because it consists of a litany of disgusting and just stupid behavior by individuals both inside and outside the frame. Morris has gussied it up in a flashy package that will draw attention to the case once more, but to what end remains unclear.

It's been 20 years since Errol Morris  made The Thin Blue Line —a found "noir" that served to free an innocent man convicted of murder. Gathering evidence and dramatizing testimony, Morris's movie circled around a single, unrepresentable event—the death of a cop on a lonely stretch of Texas highway.
The Thin Blue Line  brooded on fate, illuminating the rules that govern a trial as a form of shared fantasy. But this masterpiece not only persuaded a judge to overturn the verdict, it apparently convinced its maker that 1) his penchant for people-collecting was an essentially political enterprise, and 2) the transparent reconstructions he used to illustrate the concept of a legal fiction were legitimate forms of documentary argument. Since The Thin Blue Line 's remarkable intervention, Morris's work has grown more public and more problematic—lofty yet snide, a form of know-it-all epistemological inquiry.
Standard Operating Procedure , Morris's film about a more recent crime, caps his atrocity trilogy. Mr. Death  (1999) offered a disturbingly facetious portrait of a "scientific" Holocaust denier; more sober, The Fog of War  (2004) presented that old devil Robert McNamara  with an all-too-human face, albeit allowing McNamara to put his own spin on his prosecution of the Vietnam  War. Standard  Operating Procedure  addresses Iraq—specifically, the infamous photographs of abused prisoners at Abu Ghraib  and the so-called bad apples who took them.
Morris doesn't use voiceover; he's a master at getting interviewees to pose certain questions on their own—like why did Abu Ghraib even exist? For one thing, this prison was where Saddam 's minions murdered 30,000 Iraqis. For another, it was located in a combat zone—and under frequent mortar attack. Common sense, if not common decency, would have suggested that the U.S. level this nightmare. Instead, as Morris's interviewees attest, Rumsfeld and his generals elected to "Gitmo -ize" the operation, torturing and otherwise brutalizing prisoners they dumped there—thus converting Abu Ghraib from Baathist  hell to international symbol of American occupation.
Standard Operating Procedure  is all about symbols. The Abu Ghraib images are hardly unfamiliar; Morris's mission is to interrogate them. How did these pictures come into existence? And what, if anything, do they reveal? The snapshots and videos are mainly annotated by interviews with four of the seven bad apples, all former MPs, as well as letters home written by the most diligent of the amateur photographers, Sabrina Harman . What emerges from this testimony—which also goes a bit up the chain of command to include Janis Karpinski , the former brigadier general who supposedly oversaw Abu Ghraib, and who has since been demoted—is the suggestion that whatever the CIA  was doing to extract dubious intelligence, the MPs were just entertaining themselves by producing their own show.
Bored, ignorant, and afraid, the bad apples were simply having fun. The prisoner photographed naked on all fours with a dog collar around his neck wasn't actually dragged by the leash. The hooded guy standing on a box, wires attached to his outstretched hands, was never really in any danger. These pictures were posed! For Morris, who seems skeptical that photographs can ever disclose anything, the issue is legalistic. Focusing only on the photographic evidence, he asks if these images prove the commission of criminal acts or simply illustrate what one MP calls "standard operating procedure"—that is, the acceptable methods of stress positioning, sleep deprivation, and the ordering of inmates to masturbate while wearing nothing but panties on their heads.
If there's a moral distinction, I must be too dense to grasp its significance. In either case, these photographs demonstrate the fascist thrill of dominating a helpless fellow human—although Sabrina says that hers were an intended exposé of prison conditions. (As evidence, however, they only served to send the bad apples to jail, while their superiors and the system that created Abu Ghraib went largely unscathed.) But whether one interprets these images as proof of torture or sadism or artistic expression, they attest to the gross objectification of the prisoners (who are scarcely less objectified in this film). The MPs may have given these men names—that's Gus on the leash and good ol' Gilligan on the box—but they were used as living props.
Credit where credit is due: By arranging Gilligan's mock crucifixion, Sabrina did create a poster boy for the Iraq  War. For his part, Morris fusses with the frame. He literalizes ghosts haunting the prison corridors. He introduces Gilligan with a flash of lightning. When one of Sabrina's letters makes reference to an exploding helicopter, the filmmaker obligingly visualizes it; he accentuates her account of finding a corpse in the shower with a low-angle shot of water exploding in super-slow motion from the showerhead. A description of dogs attacking naked prisoners is supplemented with close-ups of slavering hounds. This obtrusive mannerism is not only superfluous but, for a movie that aspires to be a critique of representation, bizarrely self-defeating.
Why so frantic? Does Morris fear that the faces, voices, and photographs he's assembled are insufficiently compelling to hold an audience? A vivid description of Fallujah 's nauseating stink doesn't require smell-o-vision to register. Is he, like his subjects, compelled to amuse? Diverting attention from the banality of his inquiry? Fielding questions after a screening at the Museum of Modern Art , the filmmaker blurted out an observation on the strength of Janis Karpinski's bladder—a non sequitur less revealing of her anxiety than his. Indeed, this admission exposed Morris's standard operating procedure: Attention must be paid—if not to the film, then at least to its maker.
