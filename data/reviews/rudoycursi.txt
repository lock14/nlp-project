Seven years ago, Mexican cuties and real-life buddies Gael Garcia Bernal and Diego Luna charmed the birds out of the trees as young men on a road trip to sexual maturity in Y Tu Mama También , directed by Alfonso Cuaron from a script he wrote with his younger brother, Carlos. In Rudo y Cursi , the two actors  now with international clout  shake those branches again. To complete the circle, the production is written and directed by Carlos Cuaron and produced by, among others, Alfonso.
The brothers-making-a-movie-about- brothers backstory makes for publicity, but Rudo y Cursi  is a sly miniaturist pleasure on its own terms, a piquant fable about the bouncing ups and downs of success, failure, competition, and comradeship. (The title means ''Tough and Corny,'' a fair summation of the characters' contrasting personalities, though the boys' names are actually Beto and Tato.) Luna (Beto/Rudo) and Garcia Bernal (Tato/Cursi) play siblings who work at a banana plantation and play local soccer for the love of the sport until they are discovered by a scout (Guillermo Francella). The fast life as professional athletes beckons  and so, inevitably, does the temptation to squander the talent and bonds they possess for the immediate gratification of what they think they want. The intimate movie hums with a back-in-the-hood vibe that gets the two stars playing contentedly, and delightfully, for the love of local filmmaking.

 Beto and Tato Verdusco are half brothers who work together at a banana plantation and live with their extended family in a village in southern Mexico. When the two of them are suddenly (and somewhat improbably) plucked from rural proletarian obscurity and turned into professional soccer players in Mexico City, they achieve fame as Rudo and Cursi, nicknames that can be translated more or less as tough and corny.  “Rudo y Cursi” lives up to its name, as do its sweet and scrappy heroes, who are played with antic energy by Diego Luna (Beto, the tough one) and Gael García Bernal (Tato, the corny one). Written and directed by Carlos Cuarón, the movie tells its story haphazardly but with a winning measure of swagger and style. It mixes soap-opera sentimentality with playful, jumpy aggression and dresses a bittersweet, rags-to-riches fable in the bright clothes of pop satire.  It is hard to believe that seven years have passed since Mr. Luna and Mr. García Bernal seduced the international movie audience in “Y Tu Mamá También,” an exuberant road picture written by Mr. Cuarón and his brother, Alfonso, who also directed it. In that film they played rich kids from Mexico City traversing the countryside and finding sexual kicks and intimations of mortality amid the picturesque poverty.  In “Rudo y Cursi” (produced by Alfonso Cuarón’s new company, Cha Cha Chá), that journey is reversed, and the themes are more social than metaphysical. Tato and Beto, country boys dropped down in the big city, struggle with fame, wealth and the caprices of life in a media-saturated consumer culture.  The brothers’ adventures are diverting and occasionally touching without being entirely convincing. Their rise is engineered by a talent scout with the nickname Batuta (baton), who also delivers some mock-philosophical voice-over narration. A genial parasite, played with sly good humor by the Argentine actor Guillermo Francella, Batuta brokers a career first for Tato, a speedy and surefooted forward, and then for Beto, an indomitable goalkeeper. They are hired by rival teams, which sets up a climactic fraternal showdown during a big game.  On the way the fortunes of the brothers (and the rhythms of “Rudo y Cursi”) bounce and skitter as each one struggles with vice and temptation. Cursi’s real passion is not soccer but music, and so he pursues an ill-starred second career as an accordionist and balladeer. His signature song is a norteño version of the old Cheap Trick hit “I Want You to Want Me,” the video for which is one of the film’s comic highlights. His bid for pop stardom is accompanied by a dream-come-true tabloid romance with Maya Vega (Jessica Mas), a television hostess he and his buddies used to fantasize about back home.  Rudo is a devoted family man (his wife, who finds fulfillment peddling dietary supplements, is played by Adriana Paz), his equilibrium undermined by his hot temper just as his good fortune is threatened by his compulsive gambling. Neither brother seems especially well equipped to deal with success, and Batuta certainly isn’t much of a mentor.  But Mr. Cuarón also has trouble managing the tone of the film as it swerves from light-hearted absurdity toward a darker, more cynical view of its characters and their fate. Too often he allows “Rudo y Cursi” to coast on the likeability of its stars, who seem at times to be enjoying themselves more than their characters are able to.  And while the film is lively and engaging, it also, in the end, feels a little thin, largely because it is unsure of how earnestly to treat its own lessons about fate, ambition and brotherly love. There is a lot of velocity in this ultimately familiar tale of rising and falling, but not much gravity. “Rudo y Cursi” is partly about the consequences of taking a game much too seriously, but at the same time it treats everything else — life, death, love, money — like a game.  “Rudo y Cursi” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity, drug use, brief violence and nudity.

Already one of the top five all-time grossers in Mexico, and seemingly a sure thing for Stateside arthouse success, �Rudo y Cursi� reunites �Y tu mama tambien� stars Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal under the direction of �Mama� screenwriter Carlos Cuaron for a rags-to-riches parable powered by football, delirious vulgarity and pure personality. Produced by the Cha Cha Cha Films triumvirate of Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and the helmer�s brother Alfonso, pic scores a solid goal for its national cinema and the cause of comedy. 
Set on a banana plantation somewhere in rustic Mexico, Cuaron�s script doesn�t pussyfoot around his country�s class distinctions. Stepbrothers Beto (Luna) and Tato (Bernal) are hicks; their mother seems to collect men with unerring misjudgment, and their family life is one of squabbling, children, beer and a blind devotion to soccer. While Tato dreams of going north to become a singer (he can�t sing), the earthier and more volatile Beto just wants to make a living in bananas. But during a local pickup game, a sports agent with the apt handle of �Baton� (the comically oily Guillermo Francella) shows up in his sports car and makes the boys an offer: He�ll take one of them to Mexico City and get him into bigtime soccer. But only one. 
And so begins a rivalry that continues through twin careers that travel a dirt road of undreamed-of success, habitual gambling, drugs, bimbos and gangsters. It�s clear where the pic is going; getting there is all the fun. 
Bernal and Luna are longtime friends, and their chemistry is perfection, even when the two brothers are at each other�s throats. Upon arriving in Mexico City, where he�s introduced to graft, hazing and the rude realities of cutthroat, major league sports, the belligerent Beto is given the nickname Rudo (�tough�), and the sweeter Tato is dubbed Cursi (�corny�). That Cursi has the more flamboyant and successful career on the field makes Rudo (a goalie) a bit crazy, but he has his moments, too, and their problems and peccadilloes mount as the film makes its way toward the inevitable climactic game.
�Rudo y Cursi� is, not surprisingly, a writer�s movie, but Cuaron uses his less-than-startling visual flair to his advantage: Very little soccer shows up onscreen. What we get are reactions to what�s allegedly happening, and it turns out to be much funnier than if the pic had supplied footage and voiceover.
If there�s a bone to be picked, it�s with the pic�s moral lesson: Don�t reach above your station in life, it seems to say, because you�re bound to become a victim of your own appetites and ego. We�ve seen it all too often before. Fortunately, �Rudo y Cursi� isn�t about sociology; it�s about creating a comic showpiece for two young actors who virtually pop off the screen. 
Production values are appropriately rough. 



Not quite The Further Adventures of Cain & Abel , the second coming of Beavis & Butt-Head , King Kong vs. Godzilla Redux , or Peyton Meets Eli , but energetic fun nonetheless, Rudo y Cursi  is a multiple brother act: It's written and directed by Carlos Cuarón  and produced by elder sibling Alfonso, director of Y Tu Mamá También , which Carlos co-wrote, and reunites Mamá 's co-stars (and childhood friends) Gael García Bernal  and Diego Luna , playing half-brothers to boffo effect.
Nearly as popular on its home territory as the first Cuarón hit, Rudo y Cursi  is a similarly manic, if less psychologically fraught, exercise in male-bonding and fraternal rivalry—rooted in a road-trip that the Cuarón brothers took in their twenties. It's also a sports-inspirational story with a distinctively acrid twist. The self-deprecating attitude toward their homeland is apparent from the onset—a montage of rustic, rundown, empty soccer fields, followed by Cursi (Bernal) schlepping bananas at the rustic, rundown plantation, someplace in backwoods Jalisco , where Rudo (Luna), works as the assistant to the assistant foreman.
They're a ripe pair of bumpkins—one needn't understand much Spanish to catch their exaggerated patán  cadences. Rudo, whose sobriquet means "tough," is irascible and inarticulate; Cursi, dubbed "corny," is expansive and voluble. Each, however, is a potential soccer star—or so we're told by the good-natured little hustler, Batuta (Argentine comic Guillermo Francella ), who, in discovering the brothers and providing the movie's voiceover narration, more or less conducts the action. (The scout also supplies an appropriately macho running gag, showing up in every scene with a different tall, silent, well-endowed young woman in tow.)
Batuta can only take the brothers with him to Mexico City one at a time; thus we can enjoy their miserable digs, mind-blowing exposure to frozen food, locker room hazing, and heady success twice. Happy-go-lucky Cursi may be an unstoppable scoring machine and taciturn Rudo the greatest goalie in Mexican history, but the sports action runs a distant second to character comedy. Larded with hilarious crowd reaction shots, the only actual soccer game in the movie is the climactic match-up between the two brothers; the real competition is which of the two can be more self-destructive. Tone-deaf Cursi dreams of being a pop star; jealous family man Rudo is a compulsive gambler. Together, they make the archetypal doomed movie palooka, bewitched by bimbos and beholden to gangsters.
Rudo y Cursi  is as fatalistic as any film noir, but it's played for cartoonish screwball comedy. At once smooth and frantic, filled with cozy clutter and vulgar jive, the movie subsumes its moralizing in frat-house entertainment. What justice can you expect from a world where a man turns on the TV and learns that he's been dumped by his fiancée, or a death threat is followed by the request for an autograph? At the height of their joint triumph, the brothers return home—their half-sister is marrying the local druglord—and compete over who will buy their mother a house on Chololo beach. (Three guesses as to which of them will prevail.)
Despite an undercurrent of violence, Rudo y Cursi  eludes the tragic ending that seems to be its destiny. But even if the movie's final shot is a Pacific paradise, the denouement is pretty downbeat—at least by the grotesque standards of the conventional North American sports movie. The rocky road to success is just a dead end (or a big circular drive). Circumstances may vary, but character is unchanging. As Octavio Paz  wrote of his countrymen in The Labyrinth of Solitude , "To us a realist is always a pessimist."
