Pixar tops itself with its new animated offering Up
, a movie so visually and emotionally skillful that it makes Monsters, Inc.
 look positively antic, Toy Story
 seem like mere child�s play, and WALL-E
 appear as sentimental fluff. Up
 advances the animation studio�s steady growth toward making films that appeal to general audiences, not just kids' pictures that toss in some jokes aimed at their adult chaperones but movies that provide complete satisfaction for all viewers, no matter their age. That evolution is probably best embodied in the experience of Docter, Up
�s director, who worked on all three previously mentioned Pixar features, having directed Monsters, Inc.
, written the Toy Story
 films, and had a significant hand in shaping WALL-E
 before leaving to guide Up
. (For more about Docter, see "What Comes 'Up' �

, May 29.") Up
�s promotional campaign, which suggests little more than a fantastical movie about a house that flies on balloon power, doesn�t help spread the sense of the film�s rich emotional currents and taut action sequences. The movie�s preamble is such a penetrating thing of beauty that it could exist on its own as a lovely short film. In it we are treated to the life story of a love affair that begins in the childhoods of Ellie (Elie Docter) and Carl Fredericksen (Asner, although voiced in his childhood by Jeremy Leary). Up
 begins in a movie theatre with newsreel footage (shades of Citizen Kane
) of the fictional explorer Charles Muntz (Plummer), whose heralded career is sullied when his findings are questioned and he heads back to South America, never to be heard from again. Still, he is an inspiration to child explorers everywhere and is the reason Ellie and Carl first meet. Their life story is then told through a wordless montage that carries them from youth into old age: marriage, fixing up a dilapidated house, Ellie�s inability to bear children, their dreams of one day traveling to Muntz�s Paradise Falls, Carl�s career as a balloon seller, the passage of time and dreams forestalled, old age, and eventually, Ellie�s death, which leaves Carl a solitary old codger living out his years in the same house surrounded by memories of the past and a refusal to accept the changes required by the present. When he is finally forced out of his home, Carl manages to hook up his house to thousands of helium balloons and finally head off to Paradise Falls instead of the Shady Oaks Retirement Home. Accidentally along for the ride is Russell (Nagai), a Wilderness Explorer who is trying to earn his Assist the Elderly badge and whom Carl had thought he had shaken from his front porch by sending him out on a snipe hunt. The curmudgeonly widower and the fatherless, overeager young scout make an odd couple, but the pairing is thankfully sugar-free and wholly complementary, and the friends they make once in Paradise Falls � a dog named Dug (Peterson) and a rare bird named Kevin � are screen delights. Once there (fortunately, little time is spent on the mechanics of getting the house to South America), the group also discovers Muntz, whose early dreams have been overtaken by the vengefulness of an old man. Although Up
�s action sequences are well-constructed and suspenseful, there is really nothing that makes the film necessary to see in its 3-D format. However, in terms of its narrative structure and lessons learned, I suspect we will be comparing Up
 with classics like The Wizard of Oz
 for years to come.

I think we can safely say at this point that Pixar
 has entered its Baroque period. When "Toy Story" came out in 1995, who would have guessed that within 15 years the company would be creating the richest, most resonant entertainments in Hollywood  - on such subjects as culinary rats and a robot sentinel left in charge of a junkyard Earth? There is nothing, it seems, John Lasseter's house of soulful computer artisans can't do.

Which is why "Up" comes as a shock. Its ambitions are emotional and visual rather than thematic, but on the most basic level the new film is pure vaudeville: a loopy flyaway fantasy that's hysterically funny if only to keep the darkness at bay. It's a wonderful movie  - fit for the whole family and for once I mean that as praise  - but it doesn't seem designed for a higher purpose the way, say, "WALL-E" did. "Up" is a breather, a respite, a romp, but one with infinite shades of feeling.

Most bizarrely  - at least, to those who make their business selling plastic superheroes to our children  - the hero is an old man. A very old man. Carl Fredericksen (voiced by Ed Asner, his Lou Grant snarl undimmed by time) is a crotchety widower whose cube-shaped face sits atop his wizened frame like a bobblehead. In an elegant visual touch, he has been given the white hair and thick horn-rimmed glasses of the late-era Cary Grant. Carl doesn't like much in this modern world, and in the opening moments of "Up," we learn why.

Those first scenes function as both a prologue and a life story compacted into 10 breathtakingly beautiful minutes  - it's a Pixar short, really, and possibly the best the company has ever done. We see the young Carl, shy and entranced by 1930s newsreels of explorer Carl Muntz (Christopher Plummer), fall in with a delightful gap-toothed tomboy named Ellie. Time gracefully elides and they grow, marry, keep house, a world unto themselves. Then Ellie passes, and Carl is left with the dreams of the South American adventure they never took and a ramshackle home surrounded by urban towers. There's no place to go but, well, you know.

In its fantasy of geriatric escape, "Up" taps into a discontent our youth-obsessed culture rarely notices. The film's smart enough, though, to pack a stowaway: Russell (Jordan Nagai), an egg-shaped little kid and enthusiastic Wilderness Explorer looking to get his elderly-assistance merit badge. The duo's journey by balloon-lofted house is exciting and funny and just when you wonder where it's going to lead, the movie dumps us into a make-believe South American wonderland. There be monsters here, and one of them's a person.
None of these monsters are genuinely scary  - the movie brings on a snarling pack of talking dogs but gives its leader, Alpha (screenwriter Bob Peterson), the voice of Alvin the Chipmunk. The inherent kid-friendliness of "Up" extends to its use of 3-D as a way to convey the vastness of the South American landscape rather than as an assault weapon; you won't miss a thing if you see it in 2-D, and how's that for subversive?

Fellow travelers attach themselves to Carl and Russell: a giant gooney bird nicknamed Kevin (it's a she), an outcast talking dog named Dug (Peterson again). One of the great pleasures of "Up" is that the bird acts like a bird and the dog talks exactly the way a dog would think, with sudden timeouts for imaginary squirrels and a genetic predisposition for tennis balls. Not one frame or line of dialogue here lacks wit; you could ignore the plot entirely and subsist happily on the craftsmanship of details  - the way Carl's hand casually falls over Ellie's painted handprint on their mailbox, their souls united despite death.

There is a plot, obviously, and it involves the ancient explorer Muntz, gone barmy in pursuit of the gooney bird over the decades. "Up" thus comes down to a pitched battle between two old coots, a kid, a dog, and a surrealist's idea of an ostrich. Director Pete Docter (he helmed "Monsters, Inc." and co-wrote "WALL-E") manages the difficult feat of keeping the action aloft while conjuring a sense of ripe emotional weariness; the stakes are high because this is an old man's last chance to find any meaning in life. Because the movie's grounded, it's free to fly where it wants, and it does so with an exuberance and poignancy that at times feels majestic.

For those who've done their time in the valley of children's literature, "Up" glances off any number of classic tales: Carl's hemmed-in cottage evokes "The Little House" of Virginia Lee Burton, for instance, and Dug the dog carries echoes of the beloved Tock of "The Phantom Tollbooth." With its airborne action ballet, though  - not to mention its intertwining of fantasy and hushed emotional depth  - "Up" primarily calls to mind the films of Japanese animation great Hayao Miyazaki.

There's a satisfying sense of payback in that. Lasseter's a longtime Miyazaki fan whose legacy includes bringing the director's work to America (Disney will release "Ponyo" in August), and when this movie debuted at Cannes this month, Lasseter affirmed that "Miyazaki is in all the Pixar films." With "Up," his company has at last achieved something to stand with the master  - a work dreamlike, delicious, and strange.

As buoyant and richly tinted as the balloons that figure so prominently in its story, Up  is also thoroughly grounded in real emotion and ideas of substance. How's that for an instant boost? The result is a lovely, thoughtful, and yes, uplifting adventure (in 3-D where available) about an old guy, a kid, and a house that sails through the air, opening up new routes in life to people who thought they were stuck in their loneliness. The movie  which opened the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, a fresh choice  is Pixar's 10th commanding feature-length demonstration that the most inventive and fully rounded stories in movies today are being told by characters who require an animator's hand to breathe. Up  is a beaut. And for once, 3-D animation proves its worth. (More on that in a moment.)
Up  is a gentle ride, as befits the Walt Disney PG imprimatur. But I've rarely seen a message of such square sincerity  Life's biggest adventures can be found in your own backyard, shared with people you love!   told with such unselfconscious joy and bright good humor. Who says squares can't be hip? The star of the saga is a squat, sour old widower named Carl (voiced with Lou Grant-quality authority by Ed Asner), a balloon salesman in his late 70s with a head as blockish as a toaster. (Carl's boxy black eyeglass frames, sitting atop a Patch Adams bulb of a nose, only emphasize the set angles of his ways; the guy looks like a cross between Spencer Tracy and an eccentric out of a George Booth cartoon.) We learn that Carl's late wife, Ellie (who looks related to Helen Parr/Elastigirl from The Incredibles ), was the real free spirit and would-be explorer of the family, and that the two always planned a trip-of-a-lifetime to a magical waterfall in South America. But daily living got in the way, and Carl and Ellie stayed put: A short, wordless tribute montage reviewing their lives together from childhood through childless marriage and old age is as deeply textured as any great novel.
A holdout in the neighborhood while colorless high-rises spring up around him, Carl sinks into emotional decrepitude  until two things happen. First, he decides to tie thousands of balloons to his old house and float to South America on his own. (He's that identifiable type, someone afraid of sampling the new without schlepping the familiar along for safety.) Second, in the days before takeoff, he's visited by a pint-size stranger. An overenthusiastic scouting-type misfit bursting with boyish energy, Russell (expressive newcomer Jordan Nagai) is as round and bouncy as a balloon himself. When he becomes  an accidental stowaway on Carl's great adventure, he's unwelcome as far as Carl is concerned. But Russell turns out to be invaluable  not to mention loyal and trustworthy, a friend indeed.
Each specimen in the movie's wild parade of exotic South American animals is worth cheering, and the hilarious, acutely observed dogs who greet Carl and Russell in their new world deserve their own canine-centric spin-off feature. Likewise, under the tender direction of Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc. ), every detail of   the production is quietly exquisite. (Docter co-wrote the screenplay with Bob Peterson, who gets a codirecting credit and also supplies the voice of Dug, the dog nerd in the pack.) Michael Giacchino's gorgeous music, invoking great Max Steiner scores from the '40s and '50s, steers the story's emotional shifts with great elegance. The renderings, the color palette, the small and generous jokes, the perspective as balloons lift a whole house in the air  all are breathtaking.
But the movie's most important accomplishment may be that we're never noodged or even urged to notice these things. Even the sophisticated effects now attainable in 3-D animation are worth about as much  as a bunch of balloons unless we can feel what  a character is going through, and why. At  a press conference at Cannes after the first screening of Up , Disney·Pixar creative  honcho John Lasseter explained that although he loves 3-D as a ''fun toy,'' he has no use for disruptive tricks that leap out of the screen. ''3-D should supply depth that furthers the emotion of the scene,'' he said. Can complicated technical virtuosity be reduced to something as simple as that? Yes, if you're Up  to it.

 In its opening stretch the new Pixar movie “Up” flies high, borne aloft by a sense of creative flight and a flawlessly realized love story. Its on-screen and unlikely escape artist is Carl Fredricksen, a widower and former balloon salesman with a square head and a round nose that looks ready for honking. Voiced with appreciable impatience by Ed Asner, Carl isn’t your typical American animated hero. He’s 78, for starters, and the years have taken their toll on his lugubrious body and spirit, both of which seem solidly tethered to the ground. Even the two corners of his mouth point straight down. It’s as if he were sagging into the earth.  Eventually a bouquet of balloons sends Carl and his house soaring into the sky, where they go up, up and away and off to an adventure in South America with a portly child, some talking (and snarling and gourmet-cooking) dogs and an unexpected villain. Though the initial images of flight are wonderfully rendered — the house shudders and creaks and splinters and groans as it’s ripped from its foundation by the balloons — the movie remains bound by convention, despite even its modest 3-D depth. This has become the Pixar way. Passages of glorious imagination are invariably matched by stock characters and banal story choices, as each new movie becomes another manifestation of the movie-industry divide between art and the bottom line.  In “Up” that divide is evident between the early scenes, which tell Carl’s story with extraordinary tenderness and brilliant narrative economy, and the later scenes of him as a geriatric action hero. The movie opens with the young Carl enthusing over black-and-white newsreel images of his hero, a world-famous aviator and explorer, Charles Muntz (Christopher Plummer). Shortly thereafter, Carl meets Ellie, a plucky, would-be adventurer who, a few edits later, becomes his beloved wife, an adult relationship that the director Pete Docter brilliantly compresses into some four wordless minutes during which the couple dream together, face crushing disappointment and grow happily old side by side. Like the opener of “Wall-E” and the critic’s Proustian reminiscence of childhood in “Ratatouille,” this is filmmaking at its purest.  The absence of words suggests that Mr. Docter and the co-director Bob Peterson, with whom he wrote the screenplay, are looking back to the silent era, as Andrew Stanton did with the Chaplinesque start to “Wall-E.” Even so, partly because “Up” includes a newsreel interlude, its marriage sequence also brings to mind the breakfast table in “Citizen Kane.” In this justly famous (talking) montage, Orson Welles shows the collapse of a marriage over a number of years through a series of images of Kane and his first wife seated across from each other at breakfast, another portrait of a marriage in miniature. As in their finest work, the Pixar filmmakers have created thrilling cinema simply by rifling through its history.  Those thrills begin to peter out after the boy, Russell (Jordan Nagai), inadvertently hitches a ride with Carl, forcing the old man to assume increasingly grandfatherly duties. But before that happens there are glories to savor, notably the scenes of Carl — having decided to head off on the kind of adventure Ellie and he always postponed — taking to the air. When the multihued balloons burst through the top of his wooden house it’s as if a thousand gloriously unfettered thoughts had bloomed above his similarly squared head. Especially lovely is the image of a little girl jumping in giddy delight as the house rises in front of her large picture window, the sunlight through the balloons daubing her room with bright color.  In time Carl and Russell, an irritant whose Botero proportions recall those of the human dirigibles in “Wall-E,” float to South America where they, the house and the movie come down to earth. Though Mr. Docter’s visual imagination shows no signs of strain here — the image of Carl stubbornly pulling his house, now tethered to his torso, could have come out of the illustrated Freud — the story grows progressively more formulaic. And cuter. Carl comes face to face with his childhood hero, Muntz, an eccentric with the dashing looks and frenetic energy of a younger Kirk Douglas. Muntz lives with a legion of talking dogs with which he has been hunting a rare bird whose gaudy plumage echoes the palette of Carl’s balloons.  The talking dogs are certainly a hoot, including the slobbering yellow furball Dug  and a squeaky-voiced Doberman, Alpha (both Mr. Peterson), not to mention the dog in the kitchen and the one that pops open the Champagne. And there’s something to be said about the revelation that heroes might not be what you imagined, particularly in a children’s movie and particularly one released by Disney. (Muntz seems partly inspired by Charles Lindbergh at his most heroic and otherwise.) But much like Russell, the little boy with father problems, and much like Dug, the dog with master issues, the story starts to feel ingratiating enough to warrant a kick. O.K., O.K., not a kick, just some gently expressed regret.  “Up” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A wee bit of gentle action and a climactic fight scene, but nothing inappropriate for any viewer of any age.

Depending on what you think of "Cars," Pixar makes it either 9�  out of 10 or 10 for 10 with "Up," a captivating odd-couple adventure that becomes funnier and more exciting as it flies along. Tale of an unlikely journey to uncharted geographic and emotional territory by an old codger and a young explorer could easily have been cloying, but instead proves disarming in its deep reserves of narrative imagination and surprise, as well as its poignant thematic balance of dreams deferred and dreams fulfilled. Lack of overtly fantastical elements might endow "Up" with a somewhat lower initial must-see factor than some summer releases. But like all of Pixar's features, this one will enjoy a rewardingly long ride in all venues and formats. Pete Docter's picture has the privilege of being the first animated film to open the Cannes Film Festival, on May 13.
The two leading men are 78 and 8 years old, and the age range of those who will appreciate the picture is even a bit wider than that. Like previous classic films about escape from the mundane, from "The Wizard of Oz" to "Wall-E" and many in between, "Up" is universal in its appeal. At the same time, it may be the most subtle Pixar production to date in its use of color schemes, shapes, proportions, scale, contrast and balance, factors highlighted by the application of 3-D, which will be available at many initial engagements.
The ghost of Chaplin hovered over "Wall-E," and although "Up" is a more talkative film, it also delves back into earlier eras for inspiration. The first thing on view is a mock '30s-style black-and-white Movietone newsreel documenting the exploits of maverick explorer Charles Muntz, who heads back to South America to redeem himself after a giant bird skeleton he presents in the U.S. is denounced as a fraud.
Not long after comes an exquisite interlude that, in less than five minutes, encapsulates the life-long love affair between Carl Fredericksen and his wife Ellie in a manner worthy of even the most poetic of silent-film directors. The two were brought together by their mutual enthusiasm for Muntz, and it remained Ellie's lifelong dream to emulate the adventurer and travel to Paradise Falls in South America.
But life has other plans, and Ellie must settle for a happy life with balloon-seller Carl (voiced by Ed Asner). When she dies, she leaves behind a scrapbook as well as a very grumpy widower, who retreats into self-enforced exile. With heavy-rimmed black glasses, thick white hair and eyebrows, bulbous nose, square jaw and a scrunched body that looks like it's been through a compactor, old Carl resembles a cross between Spencer Tracy and Walter Matthau at the ends of their careers. He wants no company, content to live out his days in the house he shared with Ellie, which becomes surrounded by giant construction projects.
Finally faced with eviction, Carl concocts a plan. In a surprising and brilliantly visual sequence, thousands of colored balloons hatch from behind the house, prying it from its foundation and carrying it skyward; Carl intends to fly it to South America, fulfilling Ellie's dream.
However, he's got an unplanned passenger in the form of Russell (Jordan Nagai), a roly-poly, eager-beaver Junior Wilderness Explorer who's previously tried to enlist the old goat's help to win him a badge. The trip goes uneventfully � no time wasted on navigational challenges � the better to quickly achieve the destination. The arrival is stunningly portrayed, with thick fog clearing to reveal bizarre rock formations atop a mesa adjacent to the falls (designs were inspired by Angel Falls, the world's highest, and the actual tepui mountains around the juncture of Venezuela, Brazil and Guyana � the location of Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Lost World"). Carl and Russell quickly come upon the very sort of rare bird Muntz went back to find decades before, a brilliantly plumed, gawky 13-footer they name Kevin.
Kevin's antics throughout are so humorous and beautifully animated they would be at home in a "Looney Tunes" highlights reel, as would a breed of attack dogs commanded by Muntz himself (Christopher Plummer), who sends the canines in search of the elusive bird.
At just 89 minutes, "Up" is unusually short for a Pixar film, and the action climax comes on rapidly. One setpiece features the two old-timers, Carl and the swashbuckling Muntz, going mano a mano aboard the latter's spectacular, zeppelin-like flying ship, and numerous vertigo-producing shots show characters clinging for dear life. 
Although the cliffhanger effects are augmented by 3-D projection, never do Docter ("Monsters, Inc.") and co-director Bob Peterson shove anything in the viewer's face just because of its 3-D potential. In fact, the film's overall loveliness presents a conceivable argument in favor of seeing it in 2-D: Even with the strongest possible projector bulbs, the 3-D glasses reduce the image's brightness by 20%. At the very least, the incentive for seeing "Up" in 3-D would seem less powerful than it is for other films.
Despite the sheer volume of incident and action required of any film that includes young kids as a major portion of its target audience, "Up" is an exceptionally refined picture; unlike so many animated films, it's not all about sensory bombardment and volume. As Pixar's process is increasingly analyzed, the more one appreciates the care that goes into the writing. The underlying carpentry here is so strong, it seems it would be hard to go too far wrong in the execution.
Unsurprisingly, no one puts a foot wrong here. Vocal performances, most importantly from Asner, Plummer and nonpro Nagai, exude a warm enthusiasm, and tech specifications could not be better. Michael Giacchino's full-bodied, traditional score is superlative, developing beautiful themes as it sweeps the action along on emotional waves.


First of all, Up   is not a movie about a cranky old coot who, with the help of a roly-poly Boy Scout , finds his inner child during a series of magical adventures experienced from the front porch of a dilapidated manse held aloft by hundreds of helium-filled balloons. Such, of course, is the perception advanced by promotional materials, which sell short the latest Pixar  picture, the first American animated offering ever to open le Festival de Cannes .
That is not to fault the trailer, loaded with pretty pictures and pratfalls intended to woo the wee ones. But it doesn't prepare you for the emotional punch of Up 's first few minutes, when it presents the most heartfelt—the most sincere —love story in recent memory: the love between a boy and a girl, who become a man and a woman, who become a husband and a wife, who become a widower and a memory that haunts the rest of what follows. The first 10 minutes of Up  are flawless; the final 80 minutes, close enough. (Though, note this: Do not see Up  in 3-D. It's inessential to the tale and altogether distracting.)
The movie begins in a theater, with young Carl Fredricksen , through aviator goggles, reveling in the black-and-white newsreel adventures of the thrill-seeking Charles Muntz  (voiced by Christopher Plummer ), for whom "Adventure is out there!" Through happenstance, little Carl (voiced, barely, by Jeremy Leary ) soon meets fellow traveler Ellie (Elie Docter ), and, with her, sets out on an adventure that will last the rest of his life—a journey that includes crushing blows (Ellie can't have children) and modest highs (the simple joy of renovating a decaying house till it becomes a Technicolor dream home). The would-be world travelers stay at home till Ellie's final breath, restless but content just to be with each other—in other words, Revolutionary Road , but with love. Had Up  ended after those first few minutes, that would have been enough for some; at a recent preview screening, you could hear the adults sniffle. But behind me, a little girl asked her grandfather with great apprehension, "Is that the end of the movie?" She clearly hoped not.
Rest assured, it gets funny. And it's thrilling, too, as the third act takes place almost entirely in the sky, atop the mammoth zeppelin piloted by Muntz, who, as it turns out, has been in self-exile in South America , searching for a mythical bird whose existence he's been trying to prove for decades at the expense of his sanity.
But despite its title, Up  is decidedly earthbound: The elderly Carl (voiced by Ed Asner ) spends almost the entire movie schlepping his house across the South American landscape his wife had always hoped to visit. Carl is literally tethered to a memory, an anchor with a garden hose wrapped around his torso to keep his home from floating away. And he's kept company by an accidental intruder: Russell (Jordan Nagai ), an even more awkward version of the youthful Carl. The two are meant for each other: the husband without a wife, the son without a father, each in desperate need of companionship and adventure lest they disappear.
Perhaps by now, all of this sounds so unbearably sad and undeniably grown-up, but only because it is. Pixar movies have been moving in this direction for years—adult animation sprinkled with just enough shenanigans to entertain the kids while we get our weep on. Consider the protagonists: adults stuck in the middle and on their way further down, but trying like hell to claw back up. Monsters, Inc.  , directed by Up  co-director Pete Docter , was about mid-level drones sick of their jobs; The Incredibles  , superheroes sick of suburban mediocrity; Ratatouille  , a rat escaping the filthy sewer for a five-star kitchen. To that estimable lot add Carl, who waited till he was alone and at the end of his life to discover how much living was left to be done.
