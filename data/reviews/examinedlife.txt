 “Examined Life” is a lofty title — it comes from Plato, we’re reminded — for a modest, intermittently engaging film. Astra Taylor, whose previous documentary feature, “Zizek!,” is the second-best film ever made about the Slovenian superstar theorist Slavoj Zizek, here expands her frame of reference to include seven other prominent contemporary thinkers.  As a matter of academic training or departmental employment, not all are philosophers, strictly speaking, but they are all entertainers of big questions as well as earnest, often entertaining talkers. Part of the fun of “Examined Life” comes from watching these very intelligent people try to make themselves intelligible.  And the movie is fun, within certain limits. For some reason, Ms. Taylor has drawn her subjects from a narrow intellectual precinct, where the work of philosophical speculation and the agendas of progressive politics are assumed to be congruent. When Mr. Zizek utters the word “conservative” as a self-evident synonym for “unthinking” or “pernicious,” he is giving voice to a shared, in some cases unexamined, notion that, as Karl Marx put it in his 11th Thesis on Feuerbach, the point is not to interpret the world, but to change it.  You would not know, judging from “Examined Life” alone, that other traditions and priorities exist. But this is the filmmaker’s blind spot and should not necessarily be held against the professors who oblige her curiosity and try to answer her questions.  Ms. Taylor’s contribution is to set these philosophers in motion, to transport them from the page and the seminar room into public spaces. Kwame Anthony Appiah of Princeton muses on cosmopolitanism in a departure lounge at the Toronto airport. Avital Ronell, a literary theorist at New York University, strolls slowly around Tompkins Square Park, while Martha Nussbaum, a law professor at the University of Chicago, strides purposefully along the edge of Lake Michigan.  Mr. Zizek, ever the showman, appears in an orange safety vest at a waste-disposal site, offering a contrarian critique of the way, in his view, the ecological movement idealizes nature. His harangue is amusing and occasionally provocative, except that rather than addressing the particulars of environmental politics, he is gleefully setting fire to a straw man of his own construction.  But time at the dump with Mr. Zizek is more illuminating than 10 minutes in a rowboat with Michael Hardt, co-author of “Empire,” who muses on the incongruity of talking about revolutionary politics in Central Park, a place he characterizes as “aristocratic.” Perhaps he is speaking in a highly specialized political idiom, according to which a free public space designed by a onetime abolitionist and radical journalist somehow supports the prerogatives of inherited wealth and power. Or perhaps he’s just not a very clear thinker.  But clarity is not always the chief virtue on display in “Examined Life.” Cornel West, the Princeton professor whose back-seat ramblings punctuate the film (everyone else has a single, uninterrupted minicolloquium), clearly takes great pleasure in talking, and it is hard not to share it, at least in small doses. A man of great, one might say compulsive, erudition — not one to drop the name of a single great writer, composer or sage if five are available — he makes the case that thought can be a kind of performance art.  And, indeed, “Examined Life” is less a tour of present-day philosophy than a study in academic celebrity. Ms. Taylor has offered each of her subjects the chance to show off a little, and they find different ways of rising to the opportunity of subverting it. Some, like Mr. Zizek, Mr. Hardt and the Princeton ethicist Peter Singer, explicitly comment on their surroundings. Judith Butler, a gender theorist at the University of California, Berkeley, makes the act of taking a walk into an occasion for philosophical inquiry. Accompanied by the filmmaker’s sister  Sunaura Taylor, who uses a wheelchair because of a disability, Ms. Butler in effect transposes some of her difficult and subtle ideas about bodies, identity and social space into the language of everyday life.  More such examination would enliven “Examined Life,” which is on the whole a bit too glamorized by its brainy stars to engage them critically. Nor does it invite them to argue with one another, such contention, after all, being the real substance and practice of philosophy.  But Ms. Taylor does make some interesting introductions, and the sincerity of her admiration is not unwelcome, since nothing is easier than subjecting serious people to mockery. Which doesn’t mean that they sometimes don’t deserve it.

Starting with Socrates' observation that "the unexamined life is not worth living," "Examined Life," Astra Taylor's second philosophizing-heads docu (following "Zizek!"), serves as a playful riposte to the notion that movies are for turning one's mind off. Like "Waking Life," sans animation, the pic follows a variety of deep thinkers for a few minutes at a time -- the key difference being that the ones here, including the "Elvis of cultural theory," Slavoj Zizek, are pros. Taylor's stimulating film, enlivened by creative location shooting, will surely find an appreciative audience among highbrow cinephiles, with serious ancillary receipts to follow.
Meeting the "Why not just read the books?" question head-on, Taylor situates her walking and talking subjects within apt environments -- the window dressing of New York's Fifth Avenue for Peter Singer's meditation on the (im)morality of conspicuous consumption, a public park for Martha Nussbaum's take on social democracy, a bustling airport for Kwame Anthony Appiah's ode to human evolutionary cosmopolitanism, a garbage heap for Zizek's recycling of ecological ideology, and the filmmaker's own speedy car for passenger Cornel West's accelerated theories of death and desire, etc.
Among these, in terms of synaptic rigor and sheer star power, West is best, so it's no wonder that Taylor thrice gives him the podium. But the whole of "Examined Life" is greater than the sum of its parts, as Robert Kennedy's acute editing allows ideas -- particularly those having to do with the recognition and acceptance of human imperfection -- to carry from one segment to another. Appropriately, tech credits are splendid, despite flaws.

"Things," as Dwight D. Eisenhower  once observed, "are more like they are now than they have ever been before." But why? Is something better possible? Could there be another way of looking at life—or movies? Ideas beam out from Astra Taylor 's engaging new philoso-doc Examined Life ; the viewer basks in the intelligence on-screen and, occasionally, soaks up the rays.
A purveyor of intellectual vaudeville, the thirty-ish Taylor has mobilized a group of professional philosophers. Coaxed from their classrooms to hold forth in the midst of life are Cornel West , Avital Ronell , Peter Singer , Kwame Anthony Appiah , Martha Nussbaum , Michael Hardt , Judith Butler , and the voluble subject of Taylor's previous doc, Slavoj iek, who typically steals the show by staging his rant—a critique of "ecology"—in a garbage dump.
Something new under the sun? Very smart people explain how to live without religion even as they self-consciously attempt to be in the moment. Taylor's emphasis is on moral philosophy and, although her film's structure is not exactly dialectical, it's been assembled so that, without ever meeting face-to-face, the philosophers appear to critique each other's ideas. Thus, after West convenes the symposium by invoking Socrates' defense of self-reflection ("The unexamined life is not worth living"), Ronell pops up to interrogate the nature of self-reflection, questioning the filmmaker as to the nature of her project and slyly invoking Heidegger 's "path to nowhere" as she strides purposefully through a Manhattan park as filled with layabouts as any Greek agora.
The most stylish of the assembled philosophers, Ronell professes a suspicion of meaning and speaks in praise of moral anxiety: "If you have a good conscience, then you're worthless." Taylor retreats from the void, however, by moving the discussion to safer territory. Animal liberationist Singer takes a midtown shpatzier  along Fifth Avenue, smugly observing conspicuous consumption while explaining that ethics are a matter of basic choices. Standing in Times Square , Singer declares the meaning of life to be commitment to the common good. This neo-Kantian platitude effectively stops the conversation, although not the discourse. (At the very least, it illustrates the distinction that Ronell made, following Heidegger, between philosophy and thinking.)
Appiah uses an empty airport as a backdrop to parse the difference—highly relevant to our last presidential election—between an open-minded cosmopolitan and a parochial universalist. Strolling around Lake Michigan , Nussbaum introduces the social contract and (cosmopolitan?) notion of justice for the disabled—while the filmmaker unaccountably underscores the philosopher's presentation with obtrusively jaunty cocktail music. That Nussbaum lacks the gift of gab is accentuated by Cornel's return—driven by Taylor around Manhattan as he opines on the courage to think, with a torrent of name-dropping that climaxes in his delighted self-characterization as "a jazz man in the life of the mind."
The beat goes on as political philosopher Hardt, co-author of Empire , rows the filmmaker around Central Park  lake. Faint strains of salsa can be heard as Hardt explains how, 25 years before, he'd gone to Nicaragua  to learn how to make a revolution. In the movie's best bit of improvisation, the professor gets so caught up in his ideas that he runs the boat aground. Having failed to notice that he's not navigating a gated park, Hardt draws attention to the lake as "not a bourgeois, but an aristocratic location"—an inadvertent punch line that pretty much sets up for iek's expulsive performance beside a colossal trash heap: "This is where we should start feeling at home." The subject of his rant is ecology—which he describes as an ideology, in the Marxist sense of a comforting falsehood. "We need more alienation from nature," this most provocative (and creature-like) of the thinkers declares. "We should become more artificial."
The most action-oriented member of Taylor's cast, Butler takes a walk through a San Francisco neighborhood in the company of a disabled friend, artist Sunaura Taylor . Engaging in dialogue and picking up the thread of Nussbaum's argument in the light of iek's unsentimental humanism, Butler uses the excursion as a teachable moment on the politics of disability. West, however, gets the last word: He assimilates iek's attack on nature by suggesting wisdom begins with catastrophe and arguing against grandiose romantic projects: "Why think you should have the whole thing?" Why, indeed?
Life puts an exclamation point at the end of Taylor's variety show. As West jumps out of the filmmaker's car at the north end of Union Square and makes for the subway, two girls rush out of the crowd to shake his hand. It's The Matrix  reloaded!
