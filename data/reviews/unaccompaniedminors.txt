The Breakfast Club
 in The Terminal
? Home Alone
 meets Planes, Trains & Automobiles
? Calling John Hughes: Former Freaks and Geeks
ter Paul Feig has got your number. Feig, who went on to direct numerous TV episodes of The Office
 and Arrested Development
, has now directed this holiday kids' picture that�s neither good enough to be an instant classic nor bad enough to disappear from video stores� seasonal rental shelves for many Christmases to come. Unaccompanied Minors
 is a pretty much by-the-numbers comedy about a half-dozen kids trapped by weather in an airport on Christmas Eve. They create lots of mischief to flummox the Scroogey airport chief (Black) and his head flunky (Valderrama) who�s assigned to watch over the children. (Those in the know might also recognize three Kids in the Hall
ers � Kevin McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney � as hapless security guards.) Though the adult roles demand nothing more than moments of toothless sputtering, the child actors have all been well-cast. There�s the de facto leader of the group (Christopher), his kid sister (Saldana), the rich girl (Mantegna), the tomboy (Shephard), the black kid (Williams from Everybody Hates Chris
), and the fat kid (Kelly from Bad Santa
). They run amok, create havoc, share secrets, and plug Sharper Image products � all without terribly much imagination but effective execution nevertheless. Corddry gets the best laughs of the movie as a divorced dad who�s driving through the snowstorm to rescue his kids and has to abandon his beloved biodiesel vehicle for a hated Hummer. Unaccompanied Minors
 isn�t likely to become a frequent flyer, but it could strike a chord among children of divorce for many holiday seasons to come.


Pseudo-anarchist tweens are bound to love "Unaccompanied Minors," a clumsily made but disarming enough movie about the joys of getting away with everything.
Just in time for the holiday, hundreds of kids traveling solo are stranded at a fictional Chicago airport after a blizzard. Apparently there's an entire travel subculture of underage frequent fliers, and "Unaccompanied Minors" is a cartoon expos�. The movie concocts various obstacle courses for its five types -- Tyler James Williams (the adorable buppie nerd), Dyllan Christopher (the cute all-purpose nerd), Gina Mantegna (the rich hottie), Quinn Shephard (the tomboy), and Brett Kelly (the oaf) -- to escape the airport-security nincompoops.
In the process, the film crashes the slapstick of "Home Alone" into the youthful angst of "The Breakfast Club." Here, the kids raid the goodies in the vast unclaimed baggage room and sass the head of security -- played by the acerbic comedian Lewis Black, of all people -- because that's just what joint custody will do to a kid. A broken home has its advantages. As someone in this movie explains, "Divorced kids are more resourceful than others."
Their resourcefulness occasions frolic. Presumably, there's a big audience for sequences like an early one in which the tomboy commandeers an electric cart to plow through a crowded terminal. Whenever possible, unruliness is rewarded. Written by Jacob Meszaros and Mya Stark, the movie makes Black out to be the bad guy, even though at every turn he's never less than right -- he even corrects bad grammar -- and the kids are feloniously wrong. But since he hates Christmas, he's the villain -- and bad at his job.
The lackadaisical security qualifies the movie as a nostalgia piece. So does the inexplicable appearance of comic talents such as Teri Garr and three members of the Kids in the Hall. Also aboard as thankless ornaments on this plastic Christmas tree are Jessica Walter, B.J. Novak, and Wilmer Valderrama , who's reduced to a kid-pleasing "Ay Caramba!" In addition to Black, who gets to do some characteristic ranting (I shudder to think about the spittle that surely hit this young cast), the film wastes other "Daily Show" associates like Rob Riggle and ex-correspondent Rob Corddry , although Corddry does have a few funny moments playing an eco-minded dad reduced to dashing through the snow in a Hummer to pick up his stranded kids.
Presumably, a lot of these adults are pals with the film's director, Paul Feig, who has written for or directed episodes of the stellar sitcoms on which a few of them have appeared ("Freaks and Geeks," "Arrested Development," "The Office" ), and some of the authentic warmth in those shows creeps into "Unaccompanied Minors," which gets better as it plods along. The young stars settle into their roles. Or rather: The kids' senses of entitlement become less irritating, especially Williams, who's the magnetic star of "Everybody Hates Chris."
Eventually, a surprising kind of matter-of-factness emerges, albeit in crude ways, like the one flatulence joke that, while played as a gag, achieves a certain identifiable realism: Hey, it happens. I never stopped rooting for Black to catch these punks. But I did stop caring that the movie is rigged for him to fail.


Many unaccompanied grown-ups are probably psyched to go see the kiddie-league comedy Unaccompanied Minors . Its director, Paul Feig, was the head mind behind TV's cult classic Freaks and Geeks , the wise and wholly mature evocation of painful high-schooldom. Feig has the capacity to work well with children while  also speaking directly to adults  which is why the strictly-for-kids Minors  feels like a botch.
During Christmas week, six preteens from Breakfast Club  walks of life get stranded in a snowed-in Midwestern airport, and the movie quickly establishes itself as precisely the poorly done kind of Hollywood fantasy where almost every adult in the building promptly falls asleep in the waiting areas, as if this were a zombie film. Practically the only one still vertical enough to chase the scamps around is the airport honcho played by The Daily Show 's Lewis Black, who was not meant to deliver his usual apoplexy to children. He is not that funny; nor are any of the movie's many cameo performers (including a few players from The Office  and Arrested Development ); nor is the film as a whole. When, near the end, Rob Corddry gets an out-of-nowhere chuckle by goofing on the ''down-low'' nature of a high five from the little girl playing his kid, it registers more like a shock than a laugh. Feig does wring out a few fleeting fun/heartfelt moments from the minors, and the movie's Christmas treacle is smoother than Santa Clause 3 's. But anyone old enough to go see this without a parent or guardian will have seen it all before.

 “Unaccompanied Minors,” directed by Paul Feig and written by Jacob Meszaros and Mya Stark, presents a nightmarish, dystopian vision of contemporary America in which airline deregulation and the prevalence of divorce have turned our airports into grim holding pens for feral children and embittered workers. Not for the faint of heart, the movie is unsettling and startlingly true to life.  At least that’s how it seemed to me. To the minors I happened to be accompanying, it seemed to be reasonably good fun. Far from horrifying or enraging them, the failure of just about every grown-up except Wilmer Valderrama to behave decently and responsibly filled them with delight, much as the pervasive adult cluelessness provided the movie’s main characters with opportunities for mischief and friendship.  Set on Christmas Eve at a snowed-in Midwestern airport, “Unaccompanied Minors” assembles a squad of familiar adolescent movie types. There’s the nice guy, unfairly labeled a loser (Dyllan Christopher); the rich girl (Gina Mantegna); the angry delinquent girl (Quinn Shephard); the anti-social fat boy (Brett Kelly). In a remarkable feat of economy, the nerd, the black kid and the Jew are all rolled into the agile, jug-eared person of Tyler James Williams. Individually and then collectively, these children run afoul of Oliver Porter (Lewis Black), who is the airport’s director of passenger relations and the movie’s designated Scrooge. His underling, Zach (Mr. Valderrama), is torn between the demands of his boss and his compassion for the kids.  Mr. Black’s fellow alumnus from “The Daily Show,”  Rob Corddry, plays an environmental-activist dad who tries to rescue his children in a biodiesel-powered Mercedes. The explosion of that vehicle is one of a few moments of loud, obvious comic action that seem to have been included to justify the status of “Unaccompanied Minors” as a theatrically released motion picture, rather than the kiddie-cable seasonal special it should have been. In any case, this movie may be too much for sensitive parents to bear. Send your kids alone.  “Unaccompanied Minors” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some crude humor and a few very mild sexual innuendoes.

Kids run amuck while stranded on Christmas Eve at a snowed-in airport in the comedy "Unaccompanied Minors." Fast-paced, slickly handled kidpic probably won't create a stampede to the box office amid heavy Yuletide competition. But it's a crowdpleaser -- at least for crowds aged about 6 to 12 -- that should translate into modest theatrical returns before lucrative future seasons of annual rental and broadcast cheer.
A busy midwestern airport (pic was shot in Utah) is the layover point for a holiday season-full of travelers, including kids going solo, with most being passed from one divorced parent to another. Among them are a barely adolescent quintet first introduced on various department store Santas' laps: Dorky but cute Spencer (Dyllan Christopher), towing his crybaby little sis Katy (Dominique Saldana); princessy rich girl Grace (Gina Mantegna); Donna (Quinn Shephard), a tomboy with anger-management issues; brainiac Charlie (Tyler James Williams); and massive "Beef" (Brett Kelly), who communicates primarily with his Aquaman action figure.
When weather conditions cancel all flights, no one is more upset than passenger relations chief Mr. Porter (Lewis Black), who was greatly looking forward to a Hawaiian vacation rather than working his 15th Christmas in a row.
Unaccompanied minors are shepherded into a cavernous basement room where, with unlucky Zach (Wilmer Valderrama), the sole staffer assigned to mind them, they fast create conditions akin to a prison riot.
Cycles of escape, recapture and punishment ensue, though a climactic infusion of Christmas spirit helps keep results merry.
There's little here that will interest most grownups or teens, but "Unaccompanied Minors" generally avoids the crassness of so many recent family pics, as well as excess mawkishness. (There's a little of the latter in the last lap, pointing an accusatory finger at divorced or uncaring parents, but scenarists and helmer refrain from laying it on too thick.) Though dialogue is routine, situations are colorful enough, product placements not too over-the-top (aggressively plugged The Sharper Image aside), and the ultimate community-minded message transcends the usual orgies of slapstick destruction and gift acquisition that too many contempo live-action kidpics seem to primarily support.
Juve leads are affable, with Williams (star of "Everybody Loves Chris") getting a couple standout moments, especially when he demonstrates precocious dancing chops.
Black doesn't do anything special with his Scrooge-y part, while Valderrama is stuck in an innocuous straight-man role. Faring better are "Saturday Night Live's" Rob Riggle and three Kids in the Hall (Kevin McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney) as blundering security guards. Teri Garr and Jessica Walter have small parts; Rob Corddry has an entertaining larger one as Spencer and Katy's dad, who braves the blizzard in his bio-diesel car to rescue them from airport purgatory.
Widescreen lensing and design contribs have a bright, polished look; Michael Andrews' original score and a neat soundtrack selection of old and new holiday tunes are also plusses. While this may not be the hippest assignment for helmer Paul Feig, known largely for his TV work, he does an expert job with unremarkable material that suggests more bigscreen assignments should be forthcoming.

Freaks and Geeks creator Paul Feig  certainly knows how to cast talented young actors, but in this instance, he doesn't seem to have any idea what to do with them. So while Tyler James Williams  ( Everybody Hates Chris  ), Dyllan Christopher  ( Seabiscuit ), Brett Kelly  ( Bad Santa ), Gina Mantegna  (daughter of Joe), and Quinn Shephard  are all appealing, the series of forced slapstick scenarios they endure are not. (Memo to Feig: "That's gotta hurt!" is not a punchline.) Stranded at an airport on Christmas Eve, the five minors amuse themselves by running around, stealing things, and pissing off security officer Lewis Black  (surely no great feat, that). Anyone who has ever actually been stuck in a terminal with rowdy youngsters will not likely choose to pay money to revisit that experience on-screen.
