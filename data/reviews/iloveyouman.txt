I fear Hollywood�s Golden Age of Bromance is ready for its decline and fall. Gone are the salad days of Wedding Crashers
, The 40 Year Old Virgin
, and Role Models
, when the world was young and the thought of grown men-children indulging in extended gab sessions built around comic regression and pop-culture improvisations, while nevertheless giving passing acknowledgment to the need for women, was still new and dangerous. Looking back a few years from now, we might see the release of I Love You, Man
 as the tipping point, the moment when a trend became a formula, when inspiration became imitation, and when avid fans became a target demographic. Bromance pioneer Rudd plays Peter Klaven, a real estate agent living in Los Angeles who seems to have everything: good looks, a good job, a great apartment, and a beautiful fianc�e (Jones). What he doesn�t have is male friends. So off he goes to find a best friend and a best man. The joke is that courting men for platonic relationships is really no different than courting women for romantic ones: Family members will set you up on awkward blind dates, you�ll worry about whether you should start with lunch or coffee or dinner, you�ll trip over your words and say things you don�t mean, and, invariably, you�ll fumble around the blurry line between affection and attraction (a scene in which one of Peter�s man-dates French kisses him in a moment of misunderstanding felt as inevitable as the turning of the Earth). But in the end, you�ll fall for a guy like Sydney Fife (Segel), who is big and strong and single, cool enough to have a garage for all his guitars and his wide-screen TV, and embodies all the raw, unfettered maleness you�ve been missing in your metrosexual, monogamous little life. I Love You, Man
 makes sure to give audiences exactly what they�re expecting � sweet scenes of romance and male camaraderie spiked by moments of sexual and bodily outlandishness, involving vomit or pubic hair or whatever � but I couldn�t shake the sense that the whole thing felt compulsory, like the filmmakers knew they had to hit certain marks at certain points in their script and dutifully went about hitting them without passion or favor. Segel's Sydney is just boorish enough to be dangerous but not enough to be unlikable. Rudd does his best playing the lovable schnook, the neurotic eye in a hurricane of kooky side characters, but it�s a long way from the heights of misanthropy he scaled in Role Models
. And like most women in bromance comedies, Jones does exactly what she�s supposed to do by doing almost nothing. She�s the black hole at the center of Peter�s universe, the faceless force of gravity that silently and without personality ties him to the ground, lest the siren�s song of Rush concerts and blow-job jokes proves too powerful to resist.

With "I Love You, Man," Hollywood at long last brings itself to confront the love that dare not speak its name: that of one straight guy for another. Your average modern man-com dances so nervously around this issue that it ends up looking like sublimated gay porn, but "I Love You" puts everything right on the table  - it's a bromance that's out and proud. In the liberation are the laughs, and they stick to your ribs longer than you'd think.
In most other respects, the movie is standard smart-boy raunch. "I Love You, Man," isn't a product of the Judd Apatow comedy factory but it may as well be, what with Paul Rudd and Jason Segel in the leading roles and the same dialogue ratio of unthinkably crass to disarmingly sweet. Rudd plays Peter Klaven, a tastefully groomed Los Angeles real estate salesman who's engaged to Zooey (Rashida Jones in a good-sport performance) and shocked to realize he has no male friends and thus no best man candidate.
Segel ("Forgetting Sarah Marshall") plays Sydney Fife, a Venice Beach layabout who Peter meets after a series of "man dates" and poker nights have gone spectacularly awry. Dressing in cargo pants and Uggs, blithely refusing to pick up his dog's poop on the boardwalk, Sydney is a belly-scratching id to Peter's superego, and Segel has the sad-eyed charm to make him a real person, with real strengths and flaws. Sydney doesn't need to provide tutorials on How to Hang With Guys, since he's a living object lesson. At the same time, he's this close to loserville.
As directed by John Ham burg ("Along Came Polly") from a script by  Hamburg and Larry Levin, "I Love You, Man" is "The Odd Couple" retooled for an age of frat-dog sensitivity. Rudd is essentially playing a Felix who very badly wants to be an Oscar, so much so that whenever he tries to talk in fluent Dude his verbal clutch seizes up. These scenes are both hilarious and agonizing, Peter blurting some macho gibberish and immediately wishing he could cram it back into his mouth. He tries to improvise a hip nickname for Sydney; the only thing that comes out is a nonsensical "Jo-bin." He does impressions; they all sound like leprechauns. The movie stakes out a whole new arena  - male social performance anxiety  - and ruthlessly mines it for comic embarrassment.
Rudd has carved out an interesting niche over the years. Despite his leading-man looks, he has the weary, bloodshot eyes of a social satirist who's angry at the world yet too lazy to do anything about it. Here he understands that every guy has a little Felix in him (and an Oscar; we're each our own Odd Couple), and since Peter's natural setting is Wuss, Rudd gets to swing both ways. He cheerily makes root beer floats for Zooey and her friends and then heads down to Sydney's "man-cave" to play Rush cover tunes.
Yes, Rush  - in the eternal search for kitschy pop touchstones, it has come to this. (The band itself appears onstage during the movie, Sydney and Peter nearly wetting themselves with air-guitar wankery.) Yet for all the acuteness of the observations in "I Love You, Man," there's little follow-through. The movie applies the conventions of romantic comedies to two men  - the Meet Cute, the Love Montage, the Petty Misunderstanding, the Big Fight, the Sulk, the Make-Up  - and you keep waiting for the script to take a leap into an originality that never comes. Then you realize: The clichés are the joke.
Hamburg is sharp enough to surround his leads with smartly farcical players: Jon Favreau as a stone-faced guy's guy, Jane Curtin as Peter's mom, J.K. Simmons (of course) as his blunt-talking dad, Ron Huebel as a workplace rival who likes to scour the Web for the latest in shock-porn. TV "Hulk" Lou Ferrigno turns up as himself and briefly puts a chokehold on the movie. The women's roles are underwritten but not too badly; Sarah Burns gets the worst of it as Zooey's man-hungry best friend.
Somewhere in the middle is Andy Samberg of "SNL" as Peter's brother Robbie, so secure in his homosexuality that he comes off straight. Peter, by contrast, is a flaming but tortured metrosexual. The movie's smart enough to raise that paradox but not quite smart enough to make it work.
Instead, the laughs come from the characters' attempts to finesse issues of emotional delicacy in a world that's turning cruder by the minute. "I Love You, Man" is scorchingly potty-mouthed, but what raises the Apatow school above dumdum fare like "Miss March" is that it knows we now live in Bizarro World, where private behavior is fit for public consumption and public feelings can only be hashed out in private. When you can watch grannies doing the nasty on your desktop at work, what's left but platonic male bonding over homemade hors d'oeuvres? "It's a revelation," says Sydney about Peter's sundried tomato aioli. So, in its shaggy way, is this movie.
. 



In I Love You, Man , which is by far the best Judd Apatow comedy that Judd Apatow had nothing at all to do with, Paul Rudd gives a startlingly funny and original performance as a nice guy with serious dweebish tendencies, and the delight of what Rudd does here comes down to how exquisitely embarrassing he is to watch. He makes you wince in hilarity. Rudd, in films like Role Models  and Wet Hot American Summer , has been a wiseass par excellence, and maybe it took a wiseass to play a dork with this much merciless understanding. His Peter Klaven is an L.A. real estate agent (he's selling Lou Ferrigno's mansion) who has just gotten engaged, an event that forces him to confront the fact that he has no male friends. Who will be his groomsmen? His best man?
That sounds like a fairly mild predicament to hang a movie on, but the resonant joke of  I Love You, Man  is that the reason Peter has no pals is that he's too sweetly sincere, too in touch with his sensitive side, to indulge in  the gloriously insensitive  modes of male bonding: the reckless sex chatter and sports talk, the need to be a guy, a dude . Peter meets   Sydney (Jason Segel), who seems like natural buddy material, and the two begin to hang out. But the more Peter tries to get down with his masculine self, the more our jaws drop at how bad he is at it. He does agonizingly out-of-date SNL  routines as if they signified he was ''in the know,'' he says things like ''me slappa da bass'' in a ''reggae'' accent, and when his new friend nicknames him Pistol, he names him back  and sounds like a complete idiot jackass.
Rudd shows us the awful eagerness to please that drives Peter's strenuous attempt to fit in. He's as mesmerizingly pathetic as Austin Powers, only Peter is a dork you can believe in. The more your face turns red for him, the more you root for him. That's what makes Paul Rudd a star. I Love You, Man  is a guy-meets-guy ''romantic'' comedy, and it's part of the film's merry topical wink at how men have been changed by girl-power culture that Peter has no trouble relating to women, but to relate to men he must first figure out how to be one. And he does: by jamming with Sydney to songs by Rush (who they think is the best band in history—talk about masculine delusions!). I Love You, Man  is on the side of all things rude, raunchy, and guyish, but only   because it recognizes that the freedom to be a lout is a pillar of our civilization. And that more than ever, it's a freedom you have to earn.

 A man without a woman is like a pistol without a hammer, wrote Victor Hugo. But a romantic comedy without a female lead, well, that’s just a fine bromance and now Hollywood business as usual, as most recently demonstrated by “I Love You, Man,” a fitfully funny comedy that owes much to Judd Apatow, the king of such sublimated man-on-man affairs. Though Mr. Apatow isn’t officially credited, his DNA is all over this bromance, which stars Paul Rudd as a wuss who mans up by befriending a guy’s guy (Jason Segel) whose masculinity is so secure he wears Ugg boots and shorts to walk his wee dog.  Though he shares the soft-body profile of the typical Apatow hero — a gentle belly swell, the suggestion of an A-cup — Mr. Segel has butched up somewhat to play Sydney Fife, a surprising object of platonic affection for Peter Klaven (Mr. Rudd). The last time Mr. Segel appeared on the big screen was in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” in which he played the feminized hero, a man who cries over his broken heart.  In that film he’s so coded female that his new (female) love interest jokes, “I can see your vagina” when he balks at jumping off a cliff into the ocean. Here, though, it’s Mr. Segel who plays gender police and deploys the requisite gyno-joke by affectionately telling Peter to take his tampon out, guy-speak for chill.  Peter’s problem, according to the strait-laced if gay-friendly people around him, is that he doesn’t have a dude to call his own, a best man who can stand by his side when he marries Zooey (Rashida Jones).  In the movie’s logic that makes Peter something less than a man and somewhat more of a woman: a semi-man or, if you prefer, a femi-man. He’s far more feminized than even his gay brother, Robbie (Andy Samberg), whom their father (J. K. Simmons) calls his best friend. And so, encouraged by fiancée and family, Peter goes looking for a soul brother, a search that first leads to some regrettable male bonding involving poker and puke and a little tongue (from Thomas Lennon) during a misconstrued man date.  Peter and Sydney finally meet during an open house. A junior realty agent one multimillion-dollar sale away from his own development dreams, Peter is trying to sell Lou Ferrigno’s mansion (the former Incredible Hulk puts in amusing nongreen face time in a small role) when Sydney starts chowing down on his gourmet sandwiches. A bachelor on the hunt for diamond-collared cougars, Sydney lives a low-impact Los Angeles life with a pooch and a romper room crammed with television sets, electric guitars, a drum kit and a designated masturbation chair. Interest blooms into camaraderie when the men discover a mutual love of the band Rush, which, between this and its appearance last year on “The Colbert Report,” is definitely riding a pop cultural wave.  The director John Hamburg, working from a story idea by Larry Levin, with whom he wrote the script, doesn’t do anything with the camera, but he sets a nice, easygoing tone for the actors.  That suits the talents of Mr. Rudd, a slack screen presence who owns the patent on male adorableness and is charming to watch, even if all he can do are variations on a theme: adorable embarrassment, adorable goofiness, adorable sexiness. He’s the ultimate in nonthreatening masculinity (Seth Rogen seems macho by comparison), the male equivalent of one of those plush animals girls and even some women like to keep piled high on their beds. Given that he’s more of a character actor than leading man, he’s perfectly cast in the “girl” role.  Mr. Segel, playing a less irritating character here than in “Forgetting Sarah Marshall,” manages to be almost as adorable if slightly less ingratiating than his co-star. More conceptual than believable, Sydney alternately recalls Dean Martin (after a few) and a far tamer version of the ultimate dude, a k a Jeff Lebowski. Unlike the Dude, however, the character played by Jeff Bridges in the Coen brothers comedy, Sydney isn’t struggling against the machine or spinning in circles to the sounds of Captain Beefheart. He’s just another would-be kid whose childhood friends have all moved on — to women, families and careers — but who wants to keep hanging out with the guys, which makes him a lot like the men who make these movies.  “I Love You, Man” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Dirty words.

A Judd Apatow clone that's one of the few recent R-rated raunch fests the ubiquitous auteur of larky crudeness actually had nothing to do with, "I Love You, Man" cranks out the kind of lowball humor that makes you gag on your own laughs. Ever alert for opportunities to drop dirty bombs -- and compelled to repeat every below-the-beltjoke at least one time too many -- pic never surmounts a deeply lame central premise that makes most of the action seem fraudulent and thoroughly unnecessary. Still, this Paramount release from DreamWorks brandishes enough lascivious comedy and all-purpose randiness to score with the young target audience and rack up some solid B.O.
Any impression that John Hamburg's directorial follow-up to "Along Came Polly" features the same core idea with the recent Sundance hit "Humpday" -- that of two straight buds taking their relationship to the nether regions -- proves unfounded. Instead, "I Love You, Man" is propelled by the perplexing notion that a young man isn't properly prepared for marriage or life in general unless he has a best male friend and, in the bargain, a guy who merits being his best man at the nuptials.
It's a rare film that features an operating principle less compelling or credible than this, although the script by Hamburg and Larry Levin (the two "Dr. Dolittle" revisitations) makes use of it to put Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) into a succession of awkward and embarrassing encounters that can easily be -- and are -- misconstrued in aspiringly comic ways.
But the notion of sending him on "man-dates" in search of a best friend proves preposterously contrived, as if such a confidential and symbiotic relationship could be formed anywhere near as quickly as falling in love, or certainly lust. Add the fact that Peter's fiancee becomes completely and understandably alienated by the process and the annoyance level hits the red zone. All the picture lacks is a nudgy mother constantly asking, "So when are you going to get a best friend already?"
A mild-mannered Los Angeles real estate broker entirely lacking in any rough edges, Peter should count his blessings for having found Zooey (Rashida Jones), a sweet, freckle-nosed, adorably supportive girl next door who's happily looking forward to marrying him. He's an emblematic nice guy whose epiphany arrives when remarks overheard at one of Zooey's girls' nights make him feel his lack of male friends.
Why doesn't he have any? Well, maybe it's because he's just too straight and predictable and sincere and boring for words. But in the hope of overcoming these drawbacks, Peter turns to his cool and gay younger brother Robbie (Andy Samberg), a professional trainer who specializes in straight men, finding gays too easy. The assignations that follow have all the spontaneous ease of a blind date or an unwelcome arranged marriage, especially one in which Peter's dinner companion turns out to be gay with action on his mind.
Finally, however, Peter finds his destiny with Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), an unkempt lummox who drops by to scarf the free food at Peter's open house for the Lou Ferrigno home he's showing. Pretty soon, Peter and Sydney are a regular best-buds item, with Peter hanging at Sydney's bachelor pad, grooving on mutual musical tastes and even sharing intimacies, a new concept for Peter. Could this be the real thing, a true friend?
Add female components to such an immaturity-based boy-boy relationship, however, and you're asking for trouble, which is just what arrives when Sydney airs very private sexual laundry in a toast at Peter's engagement party. Scripters know how to up the ante with typical third-act sex-farce complications -- Ferrigno himself is amusingly worked in here -- on the way to "I Love You, Man" becoming the 2,928th romantic comedy in Hollywood history to end with a wedding.
Rudd has enough comic smarts and deft takes to make his pablum character at least halfway palatable; his most amusing running gags are verbal, in the way he blurts out things he doesn't mean to say and awkwardly tries to come up with new salutations when speaking with his too-cool new pal. Segel works in an agreeably low-key register to put over his Boudu-like interloper, who's so expert at messing up other people's lives. Although required to be warmly accommodating most of the time, Jones has the distinctive looks and manner to make you take notice.
Production values are thoroughly routine.

Just as we thought the "bromantic comedy" had overstayed its welcome, the genre reaches its highest point with I Love You, Man . The subtext is finally the text—it's right there in the title. The movie delivers an absolutely complete, fully realized, delightfully novel redo of the hoariest of forms: the meet-cute, love-at-first-sight, break-up-and-make-up, racing-to-the-altar slapstick weepy that's been a staple of cinema since the invention of cinema.
You may be surprised to find Judd Apatow 's name absent from the credits, but I Love You, Man  bears his indelible, now-inescapable stamp: from Jason Segel , who's been playing a slovenly spastic Rush fan since genre touchstone Freaks and Geeks  , to Paul Rudd , Apatow's better-looking alter ego, to John Hamburg , who directed Segel's first man-on-man hug on Apatow's Undeclared . So now, the circle is complete and at the end of the line—unless Segel, Rudd, and Seth Rogen  are willing to do gay porn.
Hamburg has tried his hand at standard-issue romantic comedy before: He directed Ben Stiller  and Jennifer Aniston  in the awkward Along Came Polly  and wrote Stiller's Focker franchise. I Love You, Man  is his first real success, if only for its honest—which is to say, sincere and crass and adorably sweet—depiction of mid-thirties-to-late-forties male friendships forged on sex talk, alcohol, and an affection for classic rock and Lou Ferrigno .
Rudd, playing the antithesis of his usual snarky self, is Peter Klaven , a luxury realtor in Los Angeles who dreams of one day building live-work lofts with a "neighborhoody dining area." He's got the fiancée with the J.D. Salinger  name—Zooey, played by Rashida Jones . To complete his dream, Peter needs only to sell "the Ferrigno estate," already setting up one of about 193 jokes you saw coming down the theater aisle.
Seems senseless to offer further plot points, as they're all laid out in the trailer. Peter has no male friends to invite to the wedding—he goes on a few bad man-dates and meets investor Sydney Fife  (Segel) at Lou's open house. The guys awkwardly bond, and "Peter and Sydney " briefly threaten "Peter and Zooey," but, really, who're we kiddin'? Hamburg fleshes out the film with smart surprises and sharp, knowing details: first dude-on-dude date jitters, ill-fated attempts at forced intimacy via nonsensical slang ("latres on the menges"), a Rush nightclub concert, guys forgetting girls hate Rush.
Half the genius is right in the casting: Rudd has two speeds—fed up and pent up—and here, he employs the latter; Peter just can't understand why Sydney would keep his masturbation station (table with lotion and tissues) out in the open at his Venice Beach  man cave. He's been raised by women: by his mother (Jane Curtin , who is not forced to play wacky or embarrassing) and by his series of girlfriends, who taught him that women like pirouettes ("from Pepperidge Farm ") in their root beer floats. (Peter's father, J.K. Simmons  in too small a role, has two best friends—one of whom is his other son, a gay personal trainer played straight by an unusually and refreshingly restrained Andy Samberg .)
And Segel, last seen unable to keep his cock in his pocket in Forgetting Sarah Marshall , does, in fact, strike one as the kind of guy who'd keep a masturbation station out in the open. But in his own way, Sydney's as sweet as Peter—more so, actually, as evidenced by an almost touching act of friendship toward the film's end involving his attempts to make Peter the success he'll never be all by his lonesome. And they lived happily ever after.
