There�s not much more to this poorly scripted thriller than exactly one well-done shock moment and Michael Keaton�s eyebrows, but, to be fair, Keaton�s brows have carried three Tim Burton films nearly on their own, so don�t let this dissuade you from seeing the film. It�s much ado about nothing, actually, or very little: that being the oft-debunked psychic friends rigmarole known in the spook hunting biz as EVP, or Electronic Voice Phenomenon, the pseudo-science of recording the voices or images of the dead on electronic equipment. This is what globalism has done to the mediums: Once content to envisage the Virgin Mary on a tortilla, they now have to hang around the local Circuit City and hope Sony slashes the prices on their ectoplasma televisions before they can get in touch with Auntie Mame to discover that she never really loved them after all. That�s progress. Keaton plays architect Jonathan Rivers, who lives with his novelist wife, Anna (West), in the sort of neo-Soviet concrete-and-steel monstrosity that passes for hip in certain architectural circles these days. On the same day that his wife joyfully announces there may be a child on the way, she goes missing and stays missing for some six months. In the interim, Jonathan is approached out of the blue and led into the black by portly EVP fan Raymond Price (McNeice), who has been receiving Anna�s monosyllabic messages from beyond both the grave and the pale. As it turns out, Anna is indeed dead, and thus her grieving husband immediately makes that dread, pricey journey to Circuit City and refashions his rumpus room to resemble something akin to the Lone Gunmen�s X-Files
 hideaway: He want to bereave. There, with the assistance of EVP booster and recent widow Sarah Tate (Unger), he struggles to comprehend why his dead wife is telling him to go to places he�s never heard of and if, perhaps, a high-definition set might have been a better choice for the money. White Noise
 has an interesting premise and one that would have worked had someone other than Niall Johnson penned the script, but that�s not the case. The film moves from romantic, Ghost
-like ennui to overt Scooby-Doo
isms about midway through, right about the time three shadowy figures begin stalking Jonathan for no apparent reason whatsoever. (If there�s one thing you�d think we�d have learned from the Mystery Inc. gang, it�s that meddling isn�t for amateurs.) Despite the frequent and inexplicable plot errors that riddle this film like the holes in Charlie Brown�s Halloween costume, the film has a certain creepy flair, thanks in large part to cinematographer Chris Seager, who�s clearly been studying the urban anti-flair found in the recent wave of technology-oriented Asian horror films like Byeong-ki Ahn�s Phone
 and the videocentric horrors of Hideo Nakata�s Ringu
 series. That beauty is only skin-deep, however, and snazzy cinematography aside, White Noise
 is little more than a droning nonsensical buzz that makes even less sense at its end than it does at its beginning.

         In the techie ghost story "White Noise," Michael Keaton plays Jonathan Rivers, an architect whose perfect life is disrupted when his wife, Anna (Chandra West), a "bestselling writer" of "international renown" and preternatural hotness, disappears. Though, should any actual bestselling writers of international renown happen to wander into the audience during the movie's early scenes by mistake, they might be dismayed at the sight of Anna swanning around the master suite of her suburban McMansion in a lacy lilac half-slip girlishly clutching a positive pregnancy test to her bosom. Anyway, such is their love and reliance on state-of-the-art communication equipment that soon after her death, Anna starts trying to touch base with her husband from beyond the grave. Before that happens, however, director Geoffrey Sax and screenwriter Niall Johnson treat us to the full measure of their up-market connubial bliss, presumably on the assumption that their surfeit of contentment will make Jonathan's loss seem that much sadder.
 
  Fat chance. "White Noise" begins as an overlit paean to trophy-wifedom and "lifestyle" living, then practically gets down on its knees and begs to be called "a stylish thriller." The movie straitjackets Keaton into a humorless, table-pounding role, preferring to let his real estate holdings, art collection and quietly expensive clothes do the talking. Before Anna's disappearance, the family inhabited a universe of such plastic perfection one could be forgiven for thinking Sax actually wants the audience to wish them ill — which would have been a far more interesting gambit than the one he actually goes for. In the place of recognizable humans, we get Anna, the kind of writer whose milky mug commands a full-page author photo on the back jacket of her new book; Jonathan, the kind of architect who walks very fast through his epically hip "raw" office space; and Mike (Nicholas Elia), the son, shunted between his mother Jane's (Sarah Strange) house and his father's cul-de-sac fantasy land (which not for nothing has white lilies embossed on the glass door), whose life seems to consist entirely of being cute, perspicacious and placidly undemanding. The Riverses plainly "have it all" — except, notably, decent reception — if "having it all" means living as though life were the joint marketing venture of Design Within Reach, the Sharper Image and a consortium of Beverly Hills plastic surgeons. All this, and they want sympathy too?
 


         






    Into this imagineered idyll bursts an unwelcome and frankly startling (considering the eerily indefectible surroundings) imperfection: the sick-making crackle of static. For all of their advanced gadgetry, the Riverses possess at least two Stone Age implements — a kitchen boom-box and an old-fashioned answering machine. From the movie's first moments, the machines snap and buzz with impending wickedness and migraine, starting off mildly and becoming increasingly demonic as Jonathan refashions himself into a 21st century ghost-buster. The static, as it turns out, is not cellphone tower interference but "messages from the other side," a notion Jonathan is first introduced to by Raymond Price (Ian McNeice), a lurking fat man who claims Anna has been trying to contact him.
 
  As Raymond explains it, he is not a medium or a psychic; he's merely a recorder of EVP (electronic voice phenomena), a TiVo of the dead, as it were. In other words, all that phone static may be caused not by sudden jolts of dirty electricity but by spectral broadcasts from the beyond.
 
  At first, Jonathan dismisses him as a weirdo, but after a cellphone, a light bulb and an elevator collude to freak him out, he moves into a loft and high-tails it to Raymond's place. But it's bad news for Jonathan, who, obsessed with recording and remixing messages from his dead wife, which sound like a bad connection with Linda Blair, slowly evolves from a skeptical professional type into a sort of DJ Spooky Spook.
 
  Eager to balance the fear factor with scientific credibility, "White Noise" begins on a pedagogical note, quoting Einstein and Edison, and ends on a postscript that says that one in 12 documented cases of EVP are "overtly threatening." This is a relief, considering that otherwise Keaton might have spent the bulk of the movie cuddled up with a 19-inch Sony flat screen. At Raymond's, Jonathan meets a bookstore owner named Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger), who has also loved, lost and communicated with the dead. Unger's exotic looks and unperturbable mien would make her a natural for this kind of story, if only she had anything more interesting to do than play the share-your-pain blond sidekick. A more exciting, if silly, acquaintance is made when, also at Raymond's, Jonathan meets a trio of slim, tall, bald and extremely angry spectral figures (imagine the Blue Man Group in hell) who start with threats and soon move on to bigger things. "We have some very bad people out there" who "like the damage," Raymond explains. These Three Enemigos of "White Noise" are well beyond not nice, though, and in their zeal for evil they wind up altering the basic premise of the movie until it morphs into something else altogether.
 
  Despite warnings from a blind medium who accuses Jonathan of "meddling" in things he doesn't understand (he's not the only one — "White Noise" is a mess of red herring), Jonathan eventually combines forces with Sarah to form a Scooby-Doo-style people-helping team. Thanks to Anna's spectral APBs, Jonathan is able to rush to the aid of women in peril as the movie's loose threads flap in his wake, and the auditory jolts keep coming right up until the illogical, tacked-on, super-violent end. With its haunted television sets, waltzing cameras and fancy digs, "White Noise" suggests nothing so much as a soulless remake of "Poltergeist," ("Yuppiegeist"?), albeit one that wouldn't really be scary at all with the sound turned off. Perhaps the scariest things about it are how hard it tries to be cool and how fundamentally it equates cool with possessing the right stuff.

There is a voice on Michael Keaton's cell phone. It's scratchy and utters nonsensical phrases. It is his agent, telling him to star in White Noise , a slapdash goose-and-run hybrid of The Ring  and Final Destination , where he will play Jonathan Rivers, a widower who receives staticky messages (Electronic Voice Phenomenon, or EVP for the initiated) from his dead wife (Chandra West). Keaton, stretching those long-dormant eyebrow muscles, accepts, and what might have been a rote horror exercise becomes instead a twitchy, mannered, often amusing rote horror exercise.
White Noise  opens with a wonderfully empty EVP testimonial from none other than Thomas Edison (''an instrument so delicate as to be affected by our personality as it survives in the next life...ought to record something'') and gets more nebulous from there. Why is Rivers so quick to drop his natural yuppie skepticism? Easy: A British (and therefore credible) stranger convinces him. Who are those malevolent shapes muttering ''pig,'' ''rot,'' and ''bastard'' over the radio and TV airwaves, baiting the FCC from beyond the grave? Is Rivers seeing past tragedies or future ones? In lieu of satisfying answers, we get crude gee-whizzikers scares, cribbed from the horror canon. As for Rivers' static problem, he has himself to blame for relying on rabbit ears and VHS. Welcome to 2005, dude: We TiVo our dead.

h, January! A month in which the savvy moviegoer, faced with the barren landscape of what is inevitably the very worst movie month in the calendar year, particularly when it comes to big-studio releases, can catch up on some of last year's best films. Have you seen "Sideways" yet? How about "Million Dollar Baby"? Neither title promises transcendence, but both provide an evening of excellent entertainment. Certainly both are far superior to what generally slinks into theaters this unhappy month, including "White Noise," a laugh-laced cheap thrill that has nothing to do with the superb Don DeLillo novel of the same title. No, this "White Noise" belongs to Geoffrey Sax, whose studio-supplied r�sum� hopefully notes that this would-be auteur "comes from a long and venerable line of BBC-trained directors," including Mike Newell and Danny Boyle. It is a long and venerable line that on the evidence of his feature filmmaking debut, Mr. Sax may bring to an unintended end. Though to be fair about a movie that doesn't deserve such generosity, the problems with this would-be thriller are rooted more in the silly, threadbare plot than in Mr. Sax's serviceable direction. He has the same fondness for sleek surfaces - the glisten of wet asphalt, the sheen of silvery appliances - shared by other British directors (Adrian Lyne, Alan Parker, ad nauseam), but he can't take full blame for the story's gaping holes and paranormal hooey. It's impossible to say exactly who takes the brunt of the blame here, although the screenwriting credit belongs to Niall Johnson, another British television veteran. Mr. Johnson apparently wrote "White Noise" in 2002, several years after the Japanese horror movie "Ringu" became a monster hit and helped trigger the recent fad for Asian horror. As in various Japanese and Korean titles, "White Noise" hinges on the premise that there are ghosts in the machine anxious to reach out and touch us, sometimes for good and generally for bad. Often, the person on this side of the death divide is a spunky woman or a high school girl in a miniskirt and knee socks, but here the hero reaching across time, space and genre is played by none other than Michael Keaton. Always a welcome screen presence, Mr. Keaton has appeared in lamentably few movies in recent years and certainly in nothing memorable. Last year, he modestly enlivened the otherwise execrable "First Daughter" and, in a peculiar twist, appears in a feature written by Mr. DeLillo, "Game 6," slated to have its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival later this month. Equally adept at comedy and drama, Mr. Keaton brings a coiled intensity to all his performances, but the last time he really registered on the big screen was with his wonderfully entertaining appearances as the Elmore Leonard character Ray Nicolette, first in Quentin Tarantino's "Jackie Brown" and then Steven Soderbergh's "Out of Sight." I doubt that I was the only Keaton fan who hoped that someone would give the actor and Ray Nicolette a movie of their own. Fast-forward to "White Noise," a film worthy neither of Mr. Keaton's talents nor even a desperate horror fan's attention. A nominal thriller, the story involves Jonathan Rivers, a gullible architect who stumbles into an underworld where the living commune with the dead via static-filled phones, computers and television sets. When not opening squeaky doors or driving down dark streets, Jonathan spends a great deal of time staring intensely into screens, fiddling with knobs and listening to the sizzle and spit of bad connections, with us staring and listening alongside him. The actress Deborah Kara Unger, who plays spooky without visible effort, pops up briefly, as does the estimable character actor Ian McNeice. In two of his few scenes, Mr. McNeice politely excuses himself and beats a hasty retreat. Can you blame him? "White Noise" is rated PG-13 (Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13). Actually, most of this is inappropriate for anyone of any age with half a brain.

"White Noise" is nothing to shout about. The first major Hollywood studio release of 2005 is an unsatisfying supernatural thriller with an effectively unsettling build-up and a frustratingly muddled pay-off. Savvy marketing campaign and intriguing subject matter may be enough to corral even ticketbuyers normally averse to creepy-spooky fare. But word of mouth generated by disappointed auds won't be kind, making rapid B.O. drop-off a dead certainty. 
Plot pivots on an alleged phenomenon known as EVP -- Electronic Voice Phenomenon -- a process by which the dearly departed communicate with the living through the static and white noise of radios, TVs, cell phones and other electronic devices. In the world according to scripter Niall Johnson, if you stare at a static-snowy TV screen long enough, you might see or hear a loved one who's communicating from the Other Side. Trouble is, you just as likely will invite contact with far less friendly spirits.
Early scenes establish a lovey-dovey relationship between architect Jonathan Rivers (Michael Keaton) and wife Anna (Chandra West), a bestselling author who delights her adoring husband when she announces her pregnancy. Auds know what to expect after five minutes of such on-screen bliss. And sure enough, it doesn't take long for tragedy to strike: Anna disappears, and eventually is found dead. Her demise is declared an accident -- yeah, sure -- and grieving Jonathan is left alone with Mike (Nicholas Elia), his young son by a previous marriage.
Enter Raymond Price (Ian McNeice), a full-bodied, soft-spoken fellow who claims that, thanks to the miracle of EVP, he has received urgent messages from the late Mrs. Rivers. Jonathan is dubious -- a reaction Keaton conveys with an eyebrow-arching worthy of Jack Nicholson -- and rebuffs the corpulent stranger.
Gradually, however, the newly widowed architect becomes an EVP believer. So much so, in fact, that he fills his home with computers, TV monitors and video recorders, all in the hope of picking up messages from Anna.
The good news is, he gets what he wants. The bad news is, other people horn in on the conversation.
Elliptical and allusive, "White Noise" proceeds with stealthy, cat-like tread during its first half, while first-time feature helmer Geoffrey Sax skillfully sustains a clammy sense of bad vibes and impending disaster. And except for the aforementioned eyebrow shtick, Keaton's lead performance is nicely understated and thoroughly sympathetic.
Lenser Chris Seager enhances the overall shivery mood by giving pic a predominantly bluish-gray sheen. Recurring water imagery is slightly overdone, but undeniably disquieting.
Unfortunately, Sax isn't able to paper over the gaps of logic and continuity that begin to undermine pic at midway point. Initially arresting premise all too quickly devolves into familiar supernatural-thriller melodramatics, as Jonathan is driven by his late wife (and other netherworldly communicants) to save lives, comfort grievers, safeguard innocents and even stalk a serial killer. It's never entirely clear why Jonathan has been singled out to assume so many responsibilities. And it's even harder to understand why Sarah Tate (Deborah Kara Unger), another EVP believer who becomes Jonathan's sometime-ally, isn't privy to the same information and insight.
Much of pic's final half-hour is given over to sudden actions and inexplicable twists that are meant to be ambiguous, but do little more than muddy the waters. It's tempting to assume that some of the confusion is due to last-minute cutting. (At least one seemingly important character, an inquisitive cop played by Mike Dopud, appears to have been drastically diminished in the editing room.)
Maybe the eventual DVD release will include enough "deleted scenes" for homevid viewers to sort things out. But while you are watching, be careful to look out for the static!

This is the language of waves and radiation, or how the dead speak to the living," wrote Don DeLillo  20 years ago in White Noise . Geoffrey Sax 's film White Noise isn't the long-awaited adaptation, alasno Hitler Studies herebut for much of its running time, it creeps along like a ghoulishly literal take on that D.D. sentence. Beginning with a long quote from Thomas Edison  that, unfolding between simulated bad-reception skips, suggests the paranormal-receptive ability of inventions to come, White Noise  quickly establishes a crude goosebump factory that goes straight to the spine.
Six months after the mysterious death of his novelist wife, Anna, grieving architect Jonathan Rivers  (Michael Keaton ) gets a call from her cell phonebut the line goes dead. Rattled, he contacts an expert in electronic voice phenomenon (EVP), a fringe practice whose adherents patiently troll the airwaves for messages from the beyond. Jonathan soon becomes obsessed, finding an ally in fellow practitioner Sarah (Deborah Kara Unger ). Pimping out his glass-clad bachelor pad with banks of monitors and recording equipment, Jonathan reads raster as Rorschach, hearing voices of the deceased buried under oceans of static. Anna's voice leads him to the scene of a gruesome accident, where he rescues a babybut it dawns on him that the swirling spirits on the other side might actually be malevolent, revealing glimpses of deaths before  they happen (a tinge of Minority Report ).
Keaton's not much more than a plug-in here, though in places he manages some economical emoting that grounds the wilder goings-on. His character resonates as a morbid stand-in for anyone chained to the computer screen, glued to any number of devices: cell phone, car radio, answering machine. As in The Ring , technology is omnipresent but uncanny in its obscuritywhat is static, anyway? White Noise  teems with whiplash scare tactics, but ably mines the same dead zone previously mapped in flashes: The Outer Limits ' vertical-horizontal prologue, the communion with snowed-out screen in Poltergeist .
The transfixingly weird Birth  crawled down the slope of reason by the end, to some viewers' chagrin; White Noise  vigorously pushes the supernatural line throughout, but unfortunately its final movement is so incoherent that the whole thing collapses. It's as if the cultural white noise of a thousand indifferent suspense flicks has gathered to drown out the initial spark of invention with a knee-jerk flurry of howling demons and unrelenting studio rain.
