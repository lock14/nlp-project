Forgive me, Sir Roger Moore, but I have forgotten you entirely. Shocking, I know. You used to be so persuasive, so cuttingly urbane, a veritable saint on His Majesty's Secret Service, doling out fisticuffs and dryly sexualized bon mots as though they were some special language all your own. At least, I think
 you did all that. As I said, my mind is a bit fuzzy on your various tenures as agent provocateur, although I do
 recall that other fellow, the Scotsman, whatsisname. He was craggy even in his youth and therefore lodges in the mental craw somewhat more pointedly. Connery. That's the one. Aged well, he did, like Edinburgh. Not so much you, Sir Moore. Ah, well. At least you're not relegated to George Lazenby's fate: Having to tussle with Jimmy Wang Yu in The Man From Hong Kong
 was by all accounts a near-death experience. (Great Ozploitation flick, though; you should check it out!) I suspect I'm not the only one, either, who has relegated his Moonraker
 and The Man With the Golden Gun
 DVDs to the dustbin of Bond history. The blame, to be sure, falls squarely on the shoulders of new Bond Daniel Craig. His onscreen charisma and exquisitely thuggish charm are such that he could likely revitalize any number of flagging film franchises with little but a three-second cameo: Mission: Impossible
, XXX
, The Little Rascals
. You name it, Craig's vicious arctic eyes will kick things to a whole new level of goodness knows what. I haven't seen star wattage this laser-focused since Gert Fr�be attempted unauthorized gender reassignment on 007 way back in Goldfinger
. Quantum of Solace
 proves that Casino Royale
 was no fluke. Director Forster may have seemed an odd choice initially. His CV is loaded with smart, probing films, among them Monster's Ball
, Stranger Than Fiction
, and The Kite Runner
, but nothing in it seemed remotely Bond
ish. But he proves more than up to the task of shepherding James Bond and new Bond girl Kurylenko through a convoluted but not unmanageable plot as both ricochet around the globe in parabolas of vengeance. Quantum
 opens mere minutes after Casino Royale
 ends, with the boy terror of British intelligence's MI6 putting a couple of dings in his beloved Aston Martin DBS while being pursued down the mountain passes surrounding Italy's Lake Garda. He's searching for the person or persons unknown who were responsible for the death of Royale
's Vesper Lynd and continues to do so throughout the film. He's aided in his below-the-law shadow vendetta by Kurylenko's Camille; they're both seeking Dominic Greene (Amalric, late of Munich
). Meanwhile, back at MI6, Dench's M is becoming increasingly paranoid about the mysterious "Quantum" group, Giannini's ever-helpful Mathis is possibly setting himself up for a major fall, and Bond is bloodier and more enraged than we've ever seen him. Paul Haggis' script (with Neal Purvis and Robert Wade) focuses not on the wages of sin but of vengeance, and they appear to be considerably more corruptive. Quantum
 feels, somewhat, like part two of some sort of very nasty Bond subgenre � it's a grim, dark, and relentlessly violent film throughout; James Bond as Terminator rather than Templar � but it delivers the goods in bloody high style: explosively, sexily, and with 007 shaken (not stirred) to his icy core.


In 'Quantum of Solace,' it's explosions, chases, and business as usual for Daniel Craig's James Bond
"Quantum of Solace" is just a fancy way of saying, "Insert hectic action sequence here." Minutes in, James Bond is chasing baddies through an Italian tunnel while aboveground a horse race is frantically underway. Not much later, he's swinging up into a glass dome, back into some scaffolding, and — oh, James, do look out for that beam.
The camera swoops and jerks like a rubber bat on a string, and all the shots look as if they've been thrown into an industrial-strength blender. Some people will see all this and think, "Wow." But no 007 experience should come so close to being a slushie.
The same could not be said of "Casino Royale," the previous installment, which rebooted the film series and introduced us to Bond as played by Daniel Craig, the unsmiling slab of man who'd taken over the job of world-saving and sport sex from Pierce Brosnan. The history of movies is full of men with the faces of unmade beds. Craig's might be the first to look rumpled by something other than sleeping.
If the foot chases and preordained explosions seemed meaningless, the solemnity behind the whole enterprise redeemed it. Craig and the filmmakers had given us the shock of seeing James Bond in a psychological, moral, and romantic tragedy. No matter how good he looked in a bathing suit, this Bond didn't seem overly pleased with himself.
In "Casino Royale," the excitement of Craig's performance lay in his being the only actor to play this part not interested in posing. Sadly, round two is business as usual. Craig dutifully time-shares the action sequences with stunt doubles and charitably allows Tom Ford's clothes, including one fetching tuxedo, to wear him.
One movie ago, Bond lost ladylove Vesper Lynd, Eva Green's bodacious treasury agent, and "Quantum of Solace" stingily leaves him no time to mourn her death. Part of his mission involves avenging Vesper, but mostly he winds up trying to stop a fake environmentalist comically named Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). Greene is a member of a terrorist outfit who plans to orchestrate an overthrow of the Bolivian government in order to hog the water supply. This is a loony little nugget of plot since its hollow echoes of "Chinatown" are reinforced by the amusement of savoring just how much Amalric resembles that movie's director, Roman Polanski.
Bond's sidekick is Greene's ex, Camille Montes, a Bolivian agent played, in a coup of colorblind casting, by the Ukrainian supermodel Olga Kurylenko. (The color, by the way, is tan.) Camille is eager to kill the former dictator (Joaquin Cosio) who oversaw the death of her family, and Bond is less eager than you'd expect to get to know her better. For that, there's an MI6 operative named Strawberry Fields (Gemma Arterton). He and Camille share nothing more intimate (and ridiculous) than a parachute crash in the Bolivian desert. Their trudge through the sand - he in a tux and she in a little black dress - produces the movie's prettiest image. That it also happens to look like a cologne ad doesn't seem at all beside the point.
The rest of the story has Jeffrey Wright reprising his part as Bond's CIA buddy Felix Leiter. Wright mostly sits around saying nothing while David Harbour, as another, crasser agent, amusingly runs his mouth. And the screenwriters - Paul Haggis and the steady adaptors of Ian Fleming's 007 stories, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade - have placed Bond in hot water with his boss, M (Judi Dench), whose larger role now revolves mostly around her poor judgment.
One agent is a turncoat, and Bond, in her estimation, is running wild. So she tries reining him in to curb his body count, which amounts to his being cut from the agency. Frankly, "Quantum of Solace" is just one exasperated dressing down away from being "Lethal Weapon 9."
Poor M: All these years and she's still holding out hope that Her Majesty's superspy will change his slutty, homicidal ways. I'm just as bad. I keep looking to these movies for a semblance of geopolitical logic. (Would Bolivian president Evo Morales stand for a Frenchman's coup? Who cares?) Attending a James Bond movie for fresh ideas on world affairs is like going to a strip club for the beer.
The trouble with "Quantum of Solace" is that the frills are a mess, too. Even the customary opening title sequence, with its writhing silhouettes and screechy theme song by Jack White and Alicia Keys, is a cheesy throwback to the Roger Moore era: Ladies and gentlemen, the Quantum of Solace dancers!
Director Marc Forster ("Monster's Ball," "Finding Neverland") is a man with a decent eye, but his sense of filmmaking verges on the grandiose. Cutting, for instance, between a shootout and the climax of Puccini's "Tosca" is beyond the pale. And what are we to make of an unfollowable sequence set at a desert hotel powered by hydrogen fuel cells beyond its being a terrible entrepreneurial endeavor? (It takes about two minutes to blow the whole thing up.)
All this carelessly wasted stunt work makes you long for the craftsmanship that goes into making the "Bourne" movies such effective precision entertainments.


Agent 007 (Daniel Craig ) is a very mad man in Quantum of Solace , a cold and vengeful chapter in the James Bond saga  with little interest in coherence, and even less in the kind of sensual pleasures and vicarious high-life thrills once anticipated from movies about Her Majesty's best-dressed secret service agent. A virtuoso action sequence is de rigueur at the start of any Bond film, of course. But the bullet-spraying car chase in Siena, Italy, that opens the 22nd edition  the second foray starring Craig as a Bond as bleak as his eyes are blue  is a Sunday drive compared with the intensity of the fury coming off that complicated British secret agent.
Quantum  picks up more or less where Casino Royale   left off two years ago. Stinging from his presumed betrayal by the late (alas) Vesper Lynd , the one babe Bond truly loved (adieu, sultry Eva Green !), 007 is hell-bent on uncovering the truth about QUANTUM, the maxi-secret international organization that blackmailed her. Applying enhanced interrogation techniques to the Euro-creepy Mr. White (Jesper Christensen), who was reeled in at the end of the last picture, seems like a good place for Bond and his impeccable boss, M (divine Judi Dench , crisp and tart as a Granny Smith apple), to begin. But it's not long  it's instantly, actually, after the revelation of a mole in MI6 erupts into a gigantic glass-shattering, oof-and-wham, parkour -influenced action scramble  before we're relying on screen titles to update us on Bond's busy itinerary. First he's in London, reporting for a less-than-satisfactory performance review (M, egged on by the CIA, wonders whether her man is even-keeled enough for his job). Then he's in Haiti, crossing paths with a sleuthing beauty named Camille (Olga Kurylenko ) while searching for a nefarious Monsieur Greene (Mathieu Amalric, both eyes wide open after The Diving Bell and the Butterfly  ), who's a QUANTUM baddie with plans to mess with global natural resources. Next he's in Austria, he's in South America, he's...well, with the biggest budget in Bond movie history, he's wherever the producers and director Marc Forster (Finding Neverland  ) want him to be.
The point is, wherever he is, this James Bond is pissed . And that ceaseless anger begins to curdle every sequence that might otherwise bring a little happiness. I mean happiness for us, the viewers  whether we're watching a scene at an avant-garde opera, a seduction, or a showy action sequence shot in a smeary color palette of browns.
With his assumption of the role in 2006, Craig triumphantly announced that there's a new 007 in town. Through his very physicality, and through his fresh interpretation of James Bond as a potent man with little interest in the silly stuff of shaken-not-stirred rituals, the actor scoured the iconic character of plaque and mannerisms. But having created such a tiger, this dark fellow needs a suitable jungle in which to prowl.
I mean it as a cockeyed compliment to the reborn Bond franchise, then, when I say that Quantum of Solace  is an unnecessarily cramped arena for such an interesting cat. Bond chases Greene with grim determination (Amalric himself is a villain of mild physical proportions, with flourishes of evil limited to a glittering hardness in the eyes). But 007 turns that same ray-gun attitude of mirthlessness on practical conversations with Camille (the beauty doesn't have time for bedroom thoughts since she's plotting a vendetta against a South American baddie of her own); on office updates with M; and on intelligence gathered from the wily CIA agent Felix Leiter (as played by Jeffrey Wright , the coolest cat in the story). Working with a screenplay by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis, Forster (the German-Swiss director who titrated the chemistry between Billy Bob Thornton  and Halle Berry  in Monster&#39;s Ball  ) offers little cinematic distinction between scenes of rage, jet lag, and the drinking of those iconic cocktails.
I have a feeling, or at least a wish, that in the next Bond picture  Craig's committed to two more  this 21st-century spy will gain greater access to his own character strengths; I hope the director will allow his star to play . For now, we can take solace that 007 is working on anger management.

Casino Royale : On the set

 A reviewer may come to a new James Bond movie — “Quantum of Solace,” directed by Marc Forster and opening Friday, is the 22nd official installment of the series in 46 years — with a nifty theory or an elaborate sociocultural hermeneutic agenda, but the most important thing to have on hand is a checklist. It’s all well and good to reflect upon the ways 007, the Harry Potter of British intelligence, has evolved over time through changes in casting, geopolitics, sexual mores and styles of dress.  But the first order of business must always be to run through the basic specs  of this classic entertainment machine’s latest model and see how it measures up.  So before we proceed to any consideration of the deeper meanings of “Quantum of Solace” (or for that matter the plain meaning of its enigmatic title), we need to assess the action, the villain, the gadgets, the babes and the other standard features.  The opening song, performed by Jack White and Alicia Keys (an intriguing duo on paper if nowhere else), is an abysmal cacophony of incompatible musical idioms, and the title sequence over which those idioms do squalling battle is similarly disharmonious: conceptually clever and visually grating. The first chase, picking up exactly where the 2006  “Casino Royale” left off, is speedy and thrilling, but the other action set-pieces are a decidedly mixed bag, with a few crisp footraces, some semi-coherent punch-outs and a dreadful boat pileup that brings back painful memories of the invisible car Pierce Brosnan tooled around in a few movies ago.  Picturesque locales? Bolivia, Haiti, Austria and Italy are featured or impersonated, to perfectly nice touristic effect. Gizmos? A bit disappointing, to tell the truth. Technological advances in the real world may not quite have outpaced those in the Bond universe, but so many movies these days show off their global video surveillance set-ups and advanced smart-phone applications that it’s hard for this one to distinguish itself.  What about the villain? One of the best in a while, I’d say, thanks to a lizardy turn from the great French actor Mathieu Amalric, who plays Dominic Greene, a ruthless economic predator disguised as an ecological do-gooder. The supporting cast is studded with equally excellent performers, including Jeffrey Wright and Giancarlo Giannini, both reprising their roles in “Casino Royale.”  And the women? There are two, as usual — not counting Judi Dench, returning as the brisk and impatient M — one (Gemma Arterton) a doomed casual plaything, the other a more serious dramatic foil and potential romantic interest. That one, called Camille, is played by Olga Kurylenko, whose specialty seems to be appearing in action pictures as the pouty, sexy sidekick of a brooding, vengeful hero. Not only Daniel Craig’s Bond, but also Mark Wahlberg’s Max Payne and Timothy Olyphant’s Hitman.  James Bond is a much livelier character than either of those mopey video-game ciphers, but he shares with them the astonishing ability to resist, indeed to ignore, Ms. Kurylenko’s physical charms.  This is not out of any professional scruple. The plot of “Quantum of Solace” is largely propelled by Bond’s angry flouting of the discipline imposed by his job, and anyway when did James Bond ever let work get in the way of sex? No, what gets in the way is emotion. 007’s grief and rage, the source of his connection to Camille, are forces more powerful than either duty or libido.  Mr. Brosnan was the first actor to allow a glimmer of complicated emotion to peek through Bond’s cool, rakish facade, and since Mr. Craig took over the franchise two years ago the character has shown a temperament at once rougher and more soulful than in previous incarnations. The violence in his first outing, “Casino Royale,” was notably intense, and while “Quantum of Solace” is not quite as brutal, the mood is if anything even more grim and downcast.  The death in “Casino” of Bond’s lover Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), along with the possibility that she had betrayed him before dying, provides an obvious psychological explanation for his somber demeanor in “Quantum.” But while the exploration of Bond’s psychology makes him, arguably at least, a deeper, subtler character — and there is certainly impressive depth and subtlety in Mr. Craig’s wounded, whispery menace — it also makes him harder to distinguish from every other grieving, seething avenger at the multiplex.  Which is to say just about every one. And here, I suppose, the deeper questions bubble up. Is revenge the only possible motive for large-scale movie heroism these days? Does every hero, whether Batman or Jason Bourne, need to be so sad?  I know grief has always been part of the Dark Knight’s baggage, but the same can hardly be said of James Bond, Her Majesty’s suave, cynical cold war paladin. His wit was part of his — of our — arsenal, and he countered the totalitarian humorlessness of his foes with a wink and a bon mot.  Are these weapons now off limits for the good guys? Or can moviegoers justify their vicarious enjoyment of on-screen mayhem — and luxury hotels, high-end cocktails and fast cars — only if there are some pseudoserious bad feelings attached? The Sean Connery James Bond movies of the 1960s were smooth, cosmopolitan comedies, which in the Roger Moore era sometimes ascended to the level of farce. With Mr. Craig, James Bond reveals himself to be — sigh — a tragic figure.  “Quantum of Solace,” a phrase never uttered in the course of this film (though it has something to do with Greene’s diabolical scheme, itself never fully explained), means something like a measure of comfort. Perhaps that describes what Bond is looking for, or maybe it is what this kind of entertainment tries to provide a fretful audience. If so, I prefer mine with a dash of mischief.  “Quantum of Solace” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its scenes of violence and sex are carefully edited to avoid showing too much gore or skin.

The shortest and certainly the most action-dense Bond ever, "Quantum of Solace" plays like an extended footnote to "Casino Royale" rather than a fully realized stand-alone movie. Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli, possibly knowing they couldn't immediately top the previous pic's sheer stylishness, have radically reshuffled the series' traditional elements, but also allowed incoming helmer Marc Forster to almost throw the baby out with the bathwater. Played with a cold, mechanical efficiency that recalls the "Bourne" movies, with almost no downtime or emotional hooks, "Quantum" will find some solace in beefy initial returns but looks unlikely to find a royale spot in Bond history or fans' hearts. Unusually, pic opens in the U.K. and other territories Oct. 31, two weeks ahead of its Stateside bow.
Though pic is the first in the series in which the action follows directly from the previous film, the differences in tone, look and tempo are instantly apparent. As the camera zooms across northern Italy's Lake Garda to pick out Bond (Daniel Craig) being chased in his Aston Martin by armed villains, it's clear that the elegance of the franchise that "Royale" director Martin Campbell resuscitated is already a thing of the past. Even David Arnold's music seems to punch the clock rather than elevating the visuals.
Thanks to his sheer physical prowess, Craig -- less muscular this time around, and more panther-like -- still manages to make the character look as if he's in control, even when he's being hunted by various villains and at least two major spook agencies, and even though seems to have suffered a personality bypass. However, the plot is unengaging: basically a grim series of near-escapes as Bond hunts (but is mostly hunted) between Latin America and Europe.
From the grittier lensing by Forster regular Roberto Schaefer, through the distractingly antsy editing by Matt Chesse and Richard Pearson, to the close-up second-unit work by Dan Bradley, "Quantum" has a generic, in-your-face functionality and a restlessness that just wants to push the movie on to the next chase/shootout/slugfest, rather than -- in the traditional Bond way -- relishing the spaces in between.
Part of this different feel is simply due to the pic's brevity: At 105 minutes, it's the shortest Bond of all, four minutes shorter than even "Dr. No" and "Goldfinger" and 39 minutes shorter than its immediate predecessor. However, it's a also a direct product of Forster's staffing: Both Pearson and Bradley worked on the "Bourne" films, while the former was Oscar-nommed for "United 93."
Still, none of this matters in the early reels, as the opening 15 minutes sweep the viewer along in a genuine adrenaline rush. Bond arrives, bloody but unbowed, in Siena, Tuscany (during the famous Palio horse race, natch); attends the interrogation, with M (Judi Dench), of Mr. White (Jesper Christensen), his captive from the end of "Royale"; and pursues an assassin across the city's tiled rooftops. So far, so good, if a little different.
Bond and M realise they've stumbled onto a seriously nasty organization that, per Mr. White, "is everywhere, but you haven't even heard of it." Via clues on a tagged dollar bill, the trail leads to Port-au-Prince, Haiti (repped by Colon, Panama City), where Bond bumps into feisty Camille (Ukrainian model-actress Olga Kurylenko). She unwittingly leads him to her untrusting, and seriously untrustworthy, lover, Dominic Greene (France's Mathieu Amalric, oozing bug-eyed villainy).
Greene, head of eco-bizzery Greene Planet, is negotiating with a Bolivian general, Medrano (Joaquin Cosio), to finance his coup in exchange for rights to a strip of desert. Camille, whose parents were killed by Medrano, is canoodling with Greene only to get access to the general.
At the 40-minute mark, as Bond follows Greene to Austria for what turns out to be a high-tech conference call by highups of the mysterious org, Quantum, the film's relentless, plot-driven momentum is already threatening to turn 007 into just a cipher in his own franchise. "The Bond Identity," anyone? He's even hunted by his own MI6, as well as the CIA, which is in cahoots with Greene.
Between the action sequences (well staged, but claustrophobic and undifferentiated) and brief moments of reflection -- Bond with M, Bond with ontime colleague Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini, returning from "Royale"), Bond with Camille -- there's a big, black hole at the center of "Quantum." For starters, there's little to distinguish Ian Fleming's agent here from any other action franchise hero, apart from his taste for fine hotels and drink. But mostly, it's the growing realization that the reason for the whole sequel is actually spurious.
Though references to Bond's late love, Vesper Lynd, pepper the script, and his desire for revenge provides an explanation for the plot whizzing around the world every few reels, the script by "Royale" writers Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (with Haggis taking a more senior role this time) never tackles Bond's grief head-on or gives him any meaningful dialogue as he aims for closure.
Stripped of "Royale's" humor, elegance and reinvented old-school stylishness, "Quantum" has little left except its plot, which is rudimentary and slightly barmy, in the line of the Roger Moore pics of the '70s and '80s.
Craig, physically fine as a human killing machine but stripped here of any humor or warmth, doesn't generate any onscreen heat with his putative femme lead, Kurylenko, who most of the time looks as if she's wandered onto the set of the wrong film. The distaff side briefly livens up with an extended cameo by Gemma Arterton, as an MI6 agent in Bolivia, who recalls perky Bond women of the ''60s.
However, the real female lead in "Quantum" is Dench, whose M this time plays a much fuller role, popping up in the most unlikely places and engaging Bond in badinage. Dench's style is always welcome, but the sheer frequency of her appearances actually diminishes what should be a remote, deus ex machina role.
Other roles, including Jeffrey Wright's encoring CIA agent, Felix Leiter, aren't much more than bits. Giannini comes off best, sharing at least a few precious moments of character development with Craig's Bond.
Title is lifted from a Fleming short story (in the 1960 collection "For Your Eyes Only") in which Bond and the Governor of Nassau have a postprandial chat about the amount of comfort/love ("Quantum of Solace") needed to keep any relationship alive, and how when the quantum stands at zero, it's time to bail out. Hopefully, that's exactly what Wilson and Broccoli will do in Bond 23 -- and return to the mischievous elegance of "Royale."

Those of us who adored Casino Royale , the 2006 reboot of the haggard, self-parodic James Bond  franchise, had some trouble trying to decide where to place it among the series' finest. Was it better than Goldfinger ? Probably not, but close. The  Spy Who Loved Me ? Maybe so. From Russia With Love ? Nope—missed it by this much , to quote another secret agent. Granted, it's all shades of bullet-gray when it comes to Bond, historically riddled with silly, soporific misfires that looked the same regardless of who wore the tux and gulped the gin and gave the girl one last gasp before she drew her last breath.
But Casino Royale  was a welcome break with a wearying tradition: It was the first James Bond movie since On Her Majesty's Secret Service  to portray 007 as something more than a suave, Kennedy-era caricature—a handsome head perched upon a tailored suit and a martini glass. Daniel Craig , an art-house bombshell if there is such a thing, brought to Bond warmth, humanity, and, above all, gives-a-damn decency heretofore lacking since George Lazenby 's sole stint as Connery's stand-in. More than just a good time spent riding shotgun in a tricked-out ride with a bad boy, Casino Royale  was a love story masquerading as a spy thriller, with Bond falling for his collaborator and eventual betrayer, Vesper Lynd  (Eva Green ), who was working for . . . ?
That, alas, is the question allegedly answered by Quantum of Solace , which takes its title from an inconsequential Ian Fleming  short story and is the first Bond movie to serve as a direct sequel. Allegedly, because Craig's second outing as Bond is as frustrating, sloppy, and brusque as its predecessor was engaging, sleek, and unhurried. At 106 minutes, it's the shortest of the Bond films, but it feels like one of the longest as it bounces hither and yon only to wind up stranded in a Bolivian desert, where baddie Dominic Greene  (The  Diving Bell and the Butterfly 's Mathieu Amalric ) is sucking the sand dry of its underwater river. Yawn. Used to be, Bond villains were larger-than-life Evil Geniuses who at least had Grand Aspirations to take over the world, bwah-haw-haw. Now, the bad guy's just a phony environmentalist with a thing for deposed dictators and dry wells.
At least, that's what Quantum of Solace  seems to be about, though most of the time it's simply too hard to tell—or too pointless to care about—courtesy of the haphazard direction of Marc Forster , who demonstrates by negative example why Bond movies are best served by journeymen with something to prove rather than would-be A-listers slumming it. From its very first moments—we enter the film mid–car chase—Quantum  is a spastic, indecipherable, unholy, and altogether unwatchable mess. Between swerves and smashes, we simply have no idea who's doing what to whom, where they're doing it, or why. What's meant to be kinetic and cathartic serves only to disorient, to keep the audience at a head-scratching distance.
It's as though Forster (Monster's Ball , Finding Neverland ) and his two editors (longtime collaborator Matt Cheese and, get this, Get Smart  and Bourne Supremacy  vet Richard Pearson ) filmed Quantum  on a roller coaster and cut the movie with a food processor set on "indecipherable." Consider the scene, only moments after the car chase, where Bond and M (Judi Dench , even more disagreeable than she was in Casino Royale ) question the mysterious Mr. White (Jesper Christensen , reprising his role from the previous film) about his role in Vesper's double-cross and death. The interrogation, but of course, turns into a shoot-out, with Bond chasing the assassin across rooftops and through broken glass ceilings—a reprise of Casino Royale 's thrilling parkour sequence, perhaps the franchise's singular Great Moment. But Forster, whose biggest action sequence to date involved Halle Berry  and Billy Bob Thornton  getting it on, interrupts the action with needless, irritating cutaways to inconsequential doings (dunno what, can't say, wouldn't matter anyway) elsewhere that render the entire scene a confounding, alienating muddle. Which is to say nothing of the klutzy opera-house shoot-out stolen from The Godfather: Part III  only moments later.
Written by Neil Purvis  and Robert Wade  (whose association with Bond dates back to 1999's The World Is Not Enough —yes, the one with Denise Richards ) and Casino Royale  pinch hitter Paul Haggis , Quantum of Solace  may ultimately prove Bond's worst enemy to date. It's both frantic and boring, a surprising and wholly unnecessary attempt to gin up the revived franchise by turning Bond into Bourne. If Bond is to bound again (which, given the box-office tracking for Quantum , is all but assured), it will have to be with a different director; Forster has done the seemingly impossible to this director-proof series, treating Bond with such disdain as to render him pointless in his own movie.
Craig, stripped naked (literally) and revealed as little more than a "maladjusted young man" in Casino Royale , is still a rookie making clumsy mistakes here, but what seemed human in the relaunching already feels stale the second go-round. Bond does little more than sulk through the picture—Forster doesn't allow him so much as a grin—while even Jeffrey Wright , back as CIA ally and comic relief Felix Leiter , seethes his way though his handful of scenes. (He's more menacing toward Bond than Amalric, a non-entity.) If nothing else, there's no need to worry about where Quantum of Solace  fits in the Bond pantheon—it's easily one of the worst.
