You might have thought it impossible that 9-year-old trouper Dakota Fanning could, at such a tender young age, appear in a more horrific nightmare vision than the misguided Bo Welch/Mike Myers missile of sorrow The Cat in the Hat
, but I�m here to tell you that you�d be wrong. Fanning, whose impossibly deep, vertiginous peepers rival those of any anim� character you�d care to name for sheer orbed wonder, is perhaps too young to pick on just yet, but her turn in Hide and Seek
, a psychological thriller that dangles over the precipitous edge of awfulness a full 90 minutes before toppling into that abyss with the resounding clatter of Robert De Niro�s ham-on-rye overacting, is just inches away from Halloween playacting throughout. De Niro is NYC-based child psychologist David Calloway, who moves himself and daughter Emily (Fanning) to the wooded hills of upstate New York after the suicide of his wife sends the traumatized tot to Bedlam with a permanent thousand-yard stare. Once there, however, surrounded by dead foliage and neighbors who seem just a tad off their sell-by date themselves, Emily begins spending her downtime with invisible friend Charlie, who may or may not be the source of all the latent rage in the house. Bad things happen in rapid succession, as David�s co-worker Elisabeth Shue quickly surmises, and eventually there�s blood all over the bathroom. Again. Fanning, to her credit, makes a fine lunatic: part Victorian china doll, part Dennis Hopper circa 1972. If they ever make a live-action version of pop culture gothling Emily the Strange, she�s the one to call, too: Her black-rimmed sockets practically scream Harmed & Dangerous. Director Polson helmed the equally oddball Swimfan
 a while back, another psychological rattletrap that never bothered to fine-tune its lunatic underpinnings. Hide and Seek
 is a more ambitious affair, chockablock with weird moments that leave you thinking that this � maybe, perhaps, probably not � could be a keeper. He manages to pull the hair-raiser strings fairly well for the first two acts, as Emily mopes around the house with a creepy smile and bad attitude straight out of The Bad Seed
, drawing pictures of people dying and shadowy black figures emerging from her closet, while De Niro putters around the almost-empty manse looking as pained as if he�d stepped on a kitty skull. It all falls apart at the end, however, and in such a loud and abrasive way that it makes Brian De Palma�s Raising Cain
 look like a model of restraint. Polson�s point (working from a script by Ari Scholssberg) seems to be that kids are never as creepy as their parentage, which fits snugly with my theory that watching Robert De Niro as a doting dad will forever be overshadowed by our collective mental image of him as Travis Bickle. Hardly a fate worse than death for an actor (that would be being remembered as Fearless Leader from The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle
), but fateful nonetheless.


Any time a press release is issued to announce ''extraordinary measures" of safeguarding a movie's secrets, the outlook for organic excitement is not good. With the horror thriller ''Hide and Seek," Twentieth Century Fox is supposedly going to the trouble and expense of numbering the final reel and shipping it separately from the rest of the film, plus having security guards hand-deliver the reel to theaters.
Spare us.
Maybe M. Night Shyamalan gets away with empty hype (see ''The Village," et al.), but first-time screenwriter Ari Schlossberg's unspectacular ''Hide and Seek" script needs protecting about as much as the average citizen needs color-coded terrorism alerts. A credible scare speaks for itself. And if memory serves, Alfred Hitchcock's ''Psycho" did OK without chaperones or gag orders.
Needless to say, ''Hide and Seek" isn't ''Psycho." It isn't even ''Swimfan," director John Polson's previous stylishly-lighted-but-sightless attempt to rattle our bones. It does, however, have a few things going for it -- star power, some truly creepy moments, excellent eye makeup -- that might be enough for viewers who don't come looking for a major payoff. For them, the basic plot summary is as follows, minus (heaven forbid) spoilers:
''Hide and Seek" opens in Manhattan, where Emily Callaway (Dakota Fanning, in an ominous brown wig) is a seemingly normal 9-year-old who adores her mom (Amy Irving) and sleeps with her bedroom door open a crack. Her father, David (Robert De Niro), is an unflappable therapist and family man, but his marriage is clearly troubled. In the middle of the night, Emily's mother is discovered with her wrists slit in a bathtub full of blood. Emily's demeanor abruptly darkens.
David thinks his sullen daughter needs a change of scenery, so he moves her to a small town upstate, where the cold gray woods are almost as off-putting as the locals. Almost immediately, Emily spots a cave in those woods and goes exploring. The circles under her hard blue eyes darken more, as does her bedroom doorway.
Quicker than you can count to ''three one thousand," disturbing signs start appearing at the Callaway house, including threats scratched in crayon and maimed dolls' faces in the trash. Emily blames all the weirdness on her invisible new friend, Charlie, but is Charlie a harmless product of Emily's tormented imagination, or is he something else that puts them in real danger?
Forced to be more restrained than precocious this time out, Fanning is easier to take than she has been in the past (try watching ''Uptown Girls"), and she does have an unsettling quality that aids the creepier moments. De Niro's character is practically a zombie in the first two thirds of the movie, but comes alive in the final act, which -- silly as the story line is -- at least lets the actor have a little fun. Everybody else in this film is completely wasted, with the stock parade of characters including a snoopy sheriff (Dylan Baker), a sexy divorcee (Elisabeth Shue), and a sympathetic shrink (Famke Janssen).
Ignore the hype. You won't find anything startling or memorable in the derivative ''Hide and Seek." Those guards are wasting their time.


         The year's first laugh-out-loud-funny thriller, "Hide and Seek," owes much to Stephen King and not a little to the perilous path of being too self-referential.
 
  "Come out, come out, wherever you are!" beckons an oft-repeated piece of dialogue, echoing star Robert De Niro's Max Cady in the 1991 version of "Cape Fear." It's a silly connective — using intentional humor to leaven the tension. Unfortunately, a far more frequent occurrence in "Hide and Seek" is inadvertent laughter at the film's silly dialogue and the dunderheaded actions of its characters.
 


         






    After the unexpected death of his wife, New York City psychologist David Callaway — played by De Niro with hand-wringing solemnity for most of the film — moves his traumatized 9-year-old daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning), upstate to a large rambling home in the woods outside a rustic town. Surrounded by leafless, Gorey-esque trees and a handful of creepy neighbors, it's just the place to raise an emotionally troubled child.
 
  Fanning, with her usual blond locks dyed Wednesday Addams black, plays Emily as the ultimate devil child. Damien Thorn from "The Omen" has nothing on this kid. As Emily becomes more withdrawn, her father tries to get her to open up in order to find out what's going on behind those soulless blue-gray eyes.
 
  Strange things begin happening around the house — cryptic messages are scrawled in blood-red crayon in the bathroom, dolls are mutilated, a family pet comes to a bad end — all of which Emily blames on her new friend, Charlie.
 
  The "come out, come out" line is taken from the children's game of the title, which Emily once played with her mother and now enjoys with Charlie. The crux of the film's action occurs when the unperceptive David finally gets around to being alarmed enough to try to determine whether Charlie is Emily's coping mechanism — a make-believe friend — or an actual person who has invaded their lives.
 
  What De Niro is doing in the film is anyone's guess. He seems to have lost interest in being taken seriously as an actor, content to lampoon his earlier career as one of cinema's great performers, run his film festival and appear as an icon in commercials for American Express.
 
  It's really Fanning's film anyway, allowing her to add a gothic layer to the preternatural children she played in "I Am Sam," "Man on Fire" and the sci-fi miniseries "Taken." Any campiness is strictly the result of John Polson's direction.
 
  As with his previous feature, "Swimfan," Polson seems inordinately fond of genre clichés, as if packing in more of them will actually make the movie scary. Nor is subtlety a factor as the director clubs the audience over the head with predictable setups and John Ottman's overwrought score.
 
  The broad outline of first-time screenwriter Ari Schlossberg's story might have worked with the double-distended-twist ending, but the execution defies any chance of an audience suspending its disbelief.
 
  From its ludicrous pre-title sequence to the drawn-out finale and its blatant setup for a sequel, the movie pulls down more laughs per minute than your average Ben Stiller comedy. Unless you're a connoisseur of movies that are so bad they're good, "Hide and Seek" is one game you're not going to want to play.

It was really only a matter of time before 10-year-old Dakota Fanning brought her unsettling precocity to the horror genre. And it's a bit of a waste. Fanning's eerie, easy emotional precision  matched by large, alien eyes that would look more at home on stalks  has always communicated something piquantly askew just beneath the adorable surface of her characters; applying such  a subtle gift to mere spookiness seems like using the Jaws of Life to open a can of beans. But Hide and Seek , despite early signs of higher goals, is a factory-standard box of shocks (it includes a creepy music box, a screaming teakettle, a doomed pet kitty), and Fanning delivers the required demonic catatonia with dutifully freakish grace. She plays Emily, a sweet child who loses first her troubled mother (to a razor and a warm bath), then her posh Central Park West digs when her well-meaning psychologist daddy (made subversively idiotic by Robert De Niro) moves them upstate to begin the healing. Emily soon announces she has a mysterious, unseen friend named Charlie, who quickly reveals a deadly antipathy for Pop and anyone else unlucky enough to drop by. It's up to Dr. Dad to banish the ''imaginary'' fiend, but the obligatory Big Reveal leaves the flick winded. What begins as a clever turn-of-the-screw to enlightened parenting ends in a rote chase. With talent like De Niro and Fanning aboard, it's a shame the filmmakers weren't game for more.

n the downbeat, sufficiently unsettling "Hide and Seek," Robert De Niro rises to a formidable challenge: he holds his own against a scene-swiping 10-year-old. As a bereft widower, David Callaway, Mr. De Niro turns out to be more than well matched by Dakota Fanning, who plays his young and only child, Emily. One of the most actively employed child actors in the movie business and one of the most gifted, Miss Fanning has both chops and a preternaturally intense screen presence. Even when you don't believe the setup, you tend to buy what she is selling. That's a good thing when it comes to a film like "Hide and Seek," which needs all the help it can get from its actors. The movie begins as if in a dream. A New York City shrink, David is married to Alison (Amy Irving), a somnolent type whose obvious affection for her daughter can't disguise her restless unhappiness. Soon after the story starts, violence descends on the Callaway family, splintering it into pieces, and David and Emily move to the country for some healing. Once there, things go from lousy to worse as Emily starts staring blankly into the surrounding woods and palling around with a sinister invisible friend called Charlie. Blood drips into the story as if from a leaky faucet; then, it pours. Under the spell of Stanley Kubrick at his most audience-friendly and "The Sixth Sense," though without the delights these influences promise, the director, John Polson, keeps the underwritten screenplay by Ari Schlossberg moving at a steady, deliberate clip. In short order it becomes clear that all is not right in this depopulated country corner, where David and Emily's next-door neighbors (Robert John Burke and Melissa Leo) always seem to be lurking with anxious, guilty eyes. Among the story's other, more approachable passers-by are David's former student (Famke Janssen) and a friendly local (Elisabeth Shue) who wears big smiles and low-cut dresses that please David but not his increasingly moody daughter. Less attractive but no less welcome is Dylan Baker as the town's somewhat vinegary sheriff. "Hide and Seek" hinges on a creepily unpleasant last-minute twist, which attentive students of the horror-thriller hybrid will probably see long in advance. Mr. Polson, whose last directorial outing was the laughably overripe high school-horror movie "Swimfan," delivers the genre goods well enough in this new movie but is not in possession of a discernable style; for the most part, he just keeps the lights down and stays out of the way of his actors. The low illumination is meant to suggest all manner of subterranean terrors, though less unhappily it also suggests some budgetary restrictions. That Mr. De Niro and especially Miss Fanning manage to register through all this murk is a testament to their talent, which however squandered does nonetheless shine. "Hide and Seek" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film contains scenes of  bloody violence, including an incident involving a pet, and intense family dynamics.

A $5 script gets the $50 million treatment in "Hide and Seek," a routine haunted child psychothriller gussied up with A-list casting led by Robert De Niro and tyke du jour Dakota Fanning. Clearly dumped in the post-Christmas frame for hit-and-run business -- pic goes into rapid worldwide roll-out in the six weeks following its Jan. 28 stateside opening -- "Hide" looks likely to scare up reasonable returns on the basis of name players and a slick trailer, but few involved will seek to put this one on their resumes.
A dialed-down, bespectacled De Niro plays Dr. David Callaway, a Manhattan psychologist with a cute young daughter, Emily (Fanning), who loves to play hide-and-seek games at bedtime, and a wife, Alison (Amy Irving), who dotes over their kid but seems strangely dissatisfied in her marriage. "Some things are beyond therapy," she says mysteriously, before being found in a tub of blood in the middle of a cold January night by David. As he holds his dead wife's body, Emily watches from the bathroom door.
After consulting with child psychologist Katherine (Famke Janssen), a former student of his, David decides he needs to be "a fulltime father" to the traumatized Emily, and moves upstate to the rural burg of Woodlands (pop. 2,206) to get away from the city. Peace and quiet are exactly what they get when they move into a spacious old house near a lake: as the tight-lipped sheriff, Hafferty (Dylan Baker), and the creepy realtor, Haskins (David Chandler), tell David, the place is mostly a summertime community.
Emily has by now developed the glazed, thousand-yard stare that screwed-up kids develop in horror movies, as well as a habit of silently communing with the woods around the house. Hide-and-seek games with dad are no longer any fun for the precocious 9-year-old and, when she tells David she's thrown away her favorite doll because she has a new friend called Charlie, David starts to worry. Especially when she says Charlie is not a doll.
By-the-numbers script by newcomer Ari Schlossberg takes its time laying the groundwork, from suspiciously over-folksy neighbors (Melissa Leo, Robert John Burke) to Emily's gradual fascination with Charlie, who never seems to be around when David's there. Fright quotient moves up a notch in the second act, as David, repeatedly awakened at two in the morning by nightmares about his dead wife, finds a series of ghastly messages scrawled on the bathroom wall, plus some nasty things in the tub.
Aussie-born actor-director John Polson ("Siam Sunset," "Swimfan") directs as if he's discovering the psycho-horror genre for the first time. Tech package is immaculate, pacing cool and assured, and the red herrings laid out with professional expertise. But it slowly becomes clear the only thing making the movie watchable is its heavyweight casting, which is completely out of kilter with Schlossberg's flyweight script. When pic springs its Big Twist 80 minutes in, prior to the feeble climax, it's clear there really is nothing under the emperor's clothes.
De Niro phones in a low-key performance that leaves plenty of room for the 10-year-old Fanning to shine, in her third (undeservedly) R-rated movie. Though she brings no extra wrinkles to a standard role, she hits all her marks with professional skill. Irving has only a few minutes' screen time (including her flashbacks), while Janssen, who's done sturdy genre service in the past, is largely wasted as the child psych who drives up to help Emily escape her demon. Onscreen for only a handful of scenes as a divorcee who takes a liking to David, Elisabeth Shue is window dressing.
As a lower-budget, no-name, gleefully generic shocker, "Hide and Seek" could at least have been fun. Instead, even more than "Swimfan," it's a pic that struts around in fine clothes while never acknowledging its essential trashiness.

From Piranha II through The Abyss  to Titanic , James Cameron  has demonstrated his affinity for the life aquatic. Hollywood 's King of the World adds depth, literally, to his immersion with a new 47-minute 3-D IMAX  nature doc, Aliens of the Deep.  Lurid title notwithstanding, this underwater explorationorganized by Cameron and some two and a half years in the makingis a Disney  co-pro that deploys canned scientific explanations and a cast of perky marine biologists to establish the requisite sense of theme park awe.
Cameron himself plays the Director, who, no laid-back Steve Zissou , orchestrates a fleet of four submersibles at something like two miles below the surface. "Here's the deal," he barks, breaking the surface of humanoid blandness. And it is a deal: De Niro-voiced sharks, CGI pilot fish, and even the sissified little SpongeBob  have nothing on the bizarre, apparently nameless creatures that Cameron and his crew discoverstarting with a fabulously 3-D-friendly cellophane scarf that swims past the submersible porthole. Perhaps the most amazing sight in this often thrilling almost-feelie, which takes as its paradoxical subject the condition of life without light, is the incredible swarm of blind albino shrimps clustered around the smoking "chimneys" formed by volcanic eruptions from beneath the ocean floor. They're not exactly cute, although Disney will be battling Pixar  for rights to the miraculously iridescent, big-eyed, Bambi-eared octopus-ish whatsit that glows prettily for the camera and vanishes back into the deep.
