I never saw the original structure  i.e., David Greig's play about the architect of a failed Glasgow housing project. But first-time writer-director Matt Tauber's adaptation, with Anthony LaPaglia as the designer of rotten Chicago housing and Viola Davis as a resident who wants the joint razed, sure feels like Tauber has done some fussy renovating. Every character in The Architect  is crazily stuccoed with crisis, including Isabella Rossellini as LaPaglia's unhappy wife, Heroes ' Hayden Panettiere as miserable daughter, and Sebastian Stan as sexually confused son.

 As “The Architect” deteriorates from a potentially enlightening exploration of urban development and class conflict  into a preposterous melodrama, your instinct is to curse creative writing courses — the kind that ask aspiring playwrights to inflate paint-by-numbers dramatic tidiness with steroidal histrionics.  That’s because “The Architect,” written and directed by Matt Tauber, was adapted from a play of the same name by the Scottish writer David Greig, and much of what’s on the screen feels like a creaky, tone-deaf classroom exercise in mechanical contrivance.  More is the pity since the movie is well acted, especially by Anthony LaPaglia, who plays Leo Waters, a successful architect whose smug sense of civic virtue is challenged by Tonya Neely (Viola Davis), a middle-aged black woman with an ax to grind. Tonya lives in Eden Court, a decaying housing project on the South Side of Chicago that Leo built decades earlier but hasn’t visited since. The project, based on ideas formulated by Le Corbusier,  has decayed into a drug-infested hellhole ruled by gangs,  and Tonya is leading a campaign to have  it torn down.  When she visits Leo to ask him to sign a petition for its demolition, he refuses. His pride stung, he insists that the problems of Eden Court can be solved through redesign.  Just as “The Architect” seems ready to delve thoughtfully into its subject,  it shifts its focus to Leo’s and Tonya’s conflicted families and turns into a shrill soap opera replete with two suicides. Leo’s wife, Julia (Isabella Rossellini), is a grim, unsmiling neat freak whose years of pent-up rage suddenly erupt  in a crockery-throwing tantrum. His sulky son, Martin (Sebastian Stan), mysteriously drops out of college, and his insecure 15-year-old daughter, Christina (Hayden Panettiere), tests her sexual attractiveness with a truck driver.  In the weakest subplot, Martin is picked up during a visit to Eden Court by Shawn (Paul James), a sensitive young gay black man who carries around a volume of Tolstoy and listens to John Denver. Although he recoils when Shawn puts the moves on him, Martin returns, and they have rough sex on a rooftop. The dynamics of this hookup are as baffling as Christina’s walk on the wild side with the sensitive trucker (Walton Goggins), who rhapsodizes over the John Hancock Center.  For her part, Tonya has two daughters: a sullen teenage single mother who lives with her  in Eden Court and a happy, optimistic A-student who stays with an oncologist from the hospital where Tonya works. The movie’s ear for Ebonics is made of tin.  This seriously overcrowded movie teems with good intentions. But with the exception of Mr. LaPaglia’s Leo, the characters remain theoretical constructions grasping at a reality that no amount of earnest acting can supply.  “The Architect” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and sexual situations.
The actress Viola Davis  has carved, handsome features and a tenacious stare that brooks no inattention. Though Davis's implacable integrity has for the most part saved her from the hooker-in-the-'hood roles that confine so many black actresses, she has yet to climb out of the prison of dignified maids and resilient inner-city mothers, except in the three movies she's made with Steven Soderbergh . She was the quietly observant voice of wisdom as Julianne Moore 's housekeeper in Todd Haynes 's Far From Heaven . She played 50 Cent 's grandmother in Jim Sheridan 's Get Rich or Die Tryin' . Her agonized performance in Denzel Washington 's Antwone Fisher   carried the movie. One can imagine this versatile actress in a host of roles, but in her umpteenth turn as a strong ghetto mother, she is the life force that lifts Matt Tauber 's workaday movie The Architect  into an experience to savor.
An urban drama about liberal complacency meeting its match, The Architect  places Davis front and center as Tonya Neeley , a community activist on Chicago's South Side  who's trying to gather enough signatures to get her ratty housing project torn down and rebuilt. Degraded by poverty, unemployment, and social collapse, the locals range from indifferent to hostile, while drug-dealing gangbangers who treat the neighborhood as their corporate headquarters menace Tonya with direct threats. Desperate for help, she shows up in the college classroom of Leo Waters  (the excellent Anthony LaPaglia ), the distinguished architect who designed the projects back in the idealistic '60s, and asks him to sign her petition.
Where Tonya is passionate, Leo is evasive and detached. He discreetly curls his lip at Tonya's eager insistence that Oprah  is one of her signatories and seizes the occasion to lecture from a great height about the influence of Le Corbusier  on the buildings he designed for that conveniently removed abstraction, the masses. "Our home," says Tonya quietly. "My design," he counters with oafish vanity.
Refusing to sign, Leo retreats to his own sleek home, where his wife and two children are choking on middle-class malaise, just as surely as Tonya's family is being worn to the quick by deprivation and despair. Even when he offers to revise his original designs, Tonya refuses to let him off the hook of radical rather than cosmetic change. It's only when the children of both families venture off home turf and fan out across the city, scaling all manner of geographical, social, and psychological barriers, that Leo is forced off his ass and out of his ivory tower.
Adapted by Tauber from a stage play by the Scottish playwright David Greig , The Architect 's macro theme is the unwillingness of the liberal bourgeoisie to face up to the unintended consequences of its social policies. Its micro theme is parallel-family collapse. Where Leo hides from his emotional manhandling of his floundering kids (Hayden Panettiere  and Sebastian Stan ) and the festering mess of his marriage to a woman (Isabella Rossellini ) who tries to drown her unhappiness in good housekeeping, Tonya struggles with grief for her lost son and mixed feelings about sending her daughter (Serena Reeder ) to live in a wealthy black home.
Morally and politically irreproachable, the movie is dramatically dull and overly wedded to its tidy dual structure. Straining to avoid stereotypy, Tauber traffics instead in equally reductive inversions: a black inner-city boy who listens to country music and reads Tolstoy; a gangbanger with a soft interior; a noble truck driver. Still, The Architect  is an affecting study in the private loneliness and strength of Tonya, a woman who understands her own motives only imperfectly but presses ahead anyway. It isn't so much what she says or does that brings Leo to self-awareness, but her belief in her mission and her refusal to be fobbed off. To that challenge, Davis brings her steady gaze and her unshakable dignity. She's a joy to behold.
