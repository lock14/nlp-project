Audiences expecting a teary but affirming melodrama based on the true events of The Wall Street Journal
 correspondent Danny Pearl�s kidnapping and murder in Pakistan should be advised that helmer Winterbottom (The Road to Guant�namo
) doesn�t roll like that: We see Pearl�s pregnant wife, Mariane (Jolie), not as a suffering saint but a journalist hungry for answers to Danny�s disappearance. Likewise, Winterbottom�s visuals are characteristically street-level; instead of panoramic vistas, he trolls the avenues of Karachi with jittery hand-held cinematography, each frame teeming with chaos � three-wheeled lorries and livestock, renegade cabbies, prayer calls over a loudspeaker, and billboards for Nokia and Pepsi. Eager to interview Sheikh Gilani (Ikram Bhatti), Danny (Futterman) steps into a car and simply vanishes, leaving behind a cooling trail of e-mails and a wife five months pregnant. Joining the hunt are a local cop (Khan), a no-nonsense federal agent (Jillian Armenante, making the most of it), and an ambassador (Patton) so tenderly disposed toward Mariane that he reads What to Expect When You�re Expecting
 and advises her on avoiding bladder infections and preterm labor. (This low-key but nuanced scene is typical of the movie�s subdued emotional pitch, and it�s not the only moment that�s offhandedly funny.) In its second act, A Mighty Heart
 takes the shape of a procedural thriller, beating down doors and seizing computers. A sudden curveball in the narrative drew gasps from our audience � good ones. As Mariane and the investigators realize that a new era of terrorism is dawning � one in which journalists are high-value targets rather than impartial citizens of the world � the first act�s gauzy vibe of clever expatriate dinner parties dissipates and is replaced by steady aloofness and dread. As with Winterbottom�s semipornographic 9 Songs
 the relationship is revealed through stylish flashbacks. The elliptical narrative also recalls Fernando Meirelles� somewhat similarly themed The Constant Gardener
, a film ultimately more heartfelt and accessible to mainstream audiences because its maker is unafraid of grief and explores it more deeply. That said, Jolie is fine in the role once Winterbottom establishes that Mariane�s mother is Cuban, thereby explaining Jolie�s kinky hairdo and heavy bronzer. (The French accent she seems to command from her actual mother.) She looks great in a series of cotton wraps, unbloated except for her bump, and she handles a challenging scene late in the film with aplomb.


Two of the most crucial characters in "A Mighty Heart " don't even get a credit. One is a city, the other is an unborn child, and between them they represent what's frustrating about the film -- why all its good intentions and visceral emotions come curiously to naught. "A Mighty Heart" is a movie about knowing, understanding, and commemorating. Both city and child remain unknowable to us, though, and so do much darker matters.
This is the Daniel Pearl story, for those of you coming in late. Adapted from Mariane Pearl's 2003 book "A Mighty Heart: The Brave Life and Death of My Husband, Danny Pearl, " the new film re-creates the events that followed the Wall Street Journal reporter's kidnapping in Karachi, Pakistan, on Jan. 23 , 2002 , culminating in the Feb. 21 delivery of the videotape of his murder.
As in the book, we're not privy to Pearl's experiences. What happened to him in captivity, even the identity and specific politics of his kidnappers remain murky. He was simply an American, a reporter, and a Jew: all capital sins to radical fundamentalists who assumed their victim was a CIA operative in the bargain.
Rather, "A Mighty Heart" remains with the pregnant Mariane (Angelina Jolie ) as she waits stoically, refusing to give in to terror while an army of investigators desperately try to find Daniel in the haystack of Karachi. He had gone to meet a source who promised information about Richard Reid , the shoe bomber, but it slowly becomes apparent that the source was bait, and that Pearl had been targeted and stalked over the course of weeks. He has been chosen as an example, and his rescuers need to find him before the example can be made.
So the movie's a police procedural, confusing -- Mariane needs a whiteboard to keep track of it all, and so do we -- and at times dizzyingly effective. The pulsing, unrelenting sprawl of Karachi is quickly revealed as the enemy. "How do you find one man in all this?" someone asks as the movie gathers chaos and strews it across the surface of the screen. Rarely is that surface penetrated in any meaningful dramatic or political way: Karachi closes its doors to the characters and to us.
The best scenes of "A Mighty Heart" follow the different investigative teams as they work together and at cross-purposes: The U S diplomatic crew under security officer Randall Bennett (Will Patton ), a cowboy jonesing for revenge, and Consul General John Bauman (William Hoyland ), weedy Wall Street Journal colleagues like Danny's boss John Bussey (Denis O'Hare ) and friend Steve LeVine (Gary Wilmes ), a steamroller of an FBI agent (Jillian Armenante ), and -- most compellingly -- a Pakistani state security chief known simply as "the Captain" (Irrfan Khan , the father in "The Namesake ").
The Captain is efficient, capable, and he knows Karachi. He's also not averse to torture if it gets him information, and, unlike the Americans on the scene, he doesn't pretend otherwise. In a movie full of blind, blundering, hopeful Westerners, he becomes the one man the audience trusts, even as we suspect we might detest him.
I almost wish "A Mighty Heart" were about the Captain, and I'd bet director Michael Winterbottom does, too. The character contains all the contradictory impulses of this region of the world that the West tries and miserably fails to boil down to black and white. Winterbottom has sifted these complexities before, in the brilliant "In This World " (2002) and last year's fine, provocative sort-of documentary "The Road to Guantanamo, " but he's playing with Hollywood toys this time, and they knock him off his stride.
To Jolie's credit as an actress -- she is
 an actress, you know, and not a bad one when a movie's not obsessing over her lips -- you mostly forget that's a tabloid queen up there. Handpicked by the Afro-Cuban-Dutch Pearl to play the role, Jolie wears brown contacts and frizzes her hair, and adopts a busy accent. Fans of actresses of color playing women of color will not be convinced, but the performance is smart and headstrong, interesting for being so interior. As the other characters explode outward in the search for Daniel (played gently and mostly in flashback by Dan Futterman ), Mariane grows increasingly still, hoping grief won't find her.
It does, of course. The problem with structuring "A Mighty Heart" as a suspense film is obvious: We already know the outcome. The video of Daniel Pearl's beheading looms large in our cultural psyche, even for those who haven't seen it (the movie doesn't show the video, although characters are seen reacting to it).
That knowledge robs "A Mighty Heart" of the urgency it needs, even a larger purpose. Why was this film made? To memorialize Daniel Pearl? He's barely onscreen. To lionize his widow? To spotlight a human tragedy within a diplomatic tragedy within a global-political disaster? Or just to hint how easy it is for a rational, well-intentioned American professional to vanish forever down the rabbit hole of Third World hatred?
The last voice we hear on the soundtrack is the real Mariane Pearl's, dedicating the film to her son , Adam , born three months after his father's murder. "A Mighty Heart" may be, in the end, only that: a letter to a child. There are worse reasons to make a movie. Given the weighty, painful resonances of this subject, there are also better ones.


         "A Mighty HEART" has to serve a number of masters — the somber story surrounding the kidnapping of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, the magnetic star quality of actress Angelina Jolie, the quasi-documentary style of director Michael Winterbottom — and it does so remarkably well.
 
 That's a lot to juggle, but the resulting film, both moving and frighteningly real, so plays to everyone's strengths that it's clear that none of the elements would have fared as well without their connection with the other two.
 


         






   The narrative of the doomed search for Pearl, for instance, taken from the bestselling book written by his widow, Mariane Pearl, could have turned maudlin and treacly in other hands. Left to another story, Winterbottom could have fallen victim to a weakness for being excessively chilly and distant, which he's displayed before. And with a different plot and director, Jolie could have ended up with an earnest but plodding film like 2003's "Beyond Borders." Instead, these various elements kept one another honest and on point just by being who and what they are.
 
 Making "A Mighty Heart" a compelling experience is quite an accomplishment given that anyone who cares enough to see the film will know the outcome of the story. Abducted on Jan. 23, 2002, in Karachi, Pakistan, Pearl was brutally murdered by his captors, a fact revealed about a month later when a grisly video was released by the killers.
 
  That awful denouement imparts a palpable sense of dread and dismay to a tale that, with its focus on religions, cultures and political systems in conflict, is in many ways a paradigmatic story of our times. As written by John Orloff (Emmy nominated for HBO's "Band of Brothers"), it's a narrative that maintains a keen balance between reasons for despair  and causes for hope, a story for which Winterbottom was an excellent choice.
 
 For though his directing career has taken some strange turns ("Code 46," "9 Songs"), Winterbottom's strength, witness "The Road to Guantanamo" and especially "In This World," is his ability to create a phenomenal sense of place, especially where southern Asia is concerned.
 
  Working with his usual cinematographer, production designer, editor and costume designer (Marcel Zyskind, Mark Digby, Peter Christelis and Charlotte Walter), Winterbottom is truly expert at manufacturing reality, at making us feel that we are right there among the crowds, the chaos, the complete foreignness of a remote part of the world. Christelis' quick, decisive editing, which lets nothing linger on the screen, is especially helpful in calling up a sense of verisimilitude that is hard to shake.
 
 Though it doesn't neglect the emotional component of the Pearls' story, "A Mighty Heart" is most accurately viewed as a kind of political film noir, a tense and elaborate police procedural investigation of both what happened to Daniel Pearl and the herculean efforts expended by Americans and Pakistanis to try  to rescue him before it was too late.
 
  Using a mixture of professional and nonprofessional actors and Winterbottom's technique of improvisation within a scripted structure, we are once again made to feel as if we are right there at the Pearls' house when key decisions are made and information disclosed.
 
 Critical to the emotional connections "A Mighty Heart" makes is the performance of Jolie as Mariane Pearl. The Oscar-winning actress, whose significant skills have been eclipsed by her position as a tabloid favorite, puts the emphasis back where it belongs with a forceful, immediate and convincing performance.
 
 Though a series of big close-ups often places her front and center, Jolie resists the temptation to push too hard or overplay her part. Rather she uses her charisma and skill to express not only weariness and fear but also the hard-edged fierceness and lack of patience that are crucial to seeing Mariane as a real person, not a biopic saint.
 
  It is Mariane we hear on "A Mighty Heart's" voice-over introducing us to the  Pearls' situation in early 2002. Both journalists (she works for French public radio) are in Pakistan to cover the war in Afghanistan and its aftermath. She poignantly describes Karachi as a city with "so many people, no one knows how to count them. How do you find one man among all these?"
 
 With Mariane now nearly six months pregnant, the Pearls are a day away from leaving the country. Danny (nicely played in an abbreviated role by Dan Futterman) just has one last interview to do, with a hard-to-find man named Sheikh Gilani, a cleric with ties to militant Islamic groups. He heads off in a taxi, but he never returns.
 
 Once what has happened to Pearl is known, a mixed group of Americans and Pakistanis comes together, not without difficulty and misunderstandings, to try  to ascertain who took him and why. The ins and outs of the prolonged investigation, the sense of chaos and confusion joined with determination and hope, are the center of "A Mighty Heart's" drama.
 
  At the heart of that quest is Mariane Pearl, someone whose refusal to give up not only on Danny's fate but also on the quest for truth and the power of communication he believed in is the film's most hopeful element. Early in "A Mighty Heart," those ideals are mocked at a dinner party as "a romantic idea of journalism," but they finally turn out to be ideas both Daniel Pearl and this committed film believe are worth making a dreadful sacrifice for.

Wish though we might for another option, we know the terrible ending of A Mighty Heart  before the movie begins. While investigating a story in Karachi, Pakistan, on ''shoe bomber'' Richard Reid in early 2002, Wall Street Journal  reporter and South Asia bureau chief Daniel Pearl was kidnapped and murdered, and his beheading was documented on camera with sickening cruelty of purpose. Pearl's wife, Mariane, herself a freelance journalist for French radio and television, was pregnant at the time, and after her husband's death, she wrote a book about his life and work  and their happy time together  with the couple's son, Adam, in mind. If today even strangers refer to the Pearls as Danny and Mariane, it is because, through the intimate accessibility of her prose and the fresh glamour of their photogenic images, Mariane Pearl has succeeded so well in personalizing the dangers that accompany the necessity of a free press. Scores more journalists have since died in the line of duty.
The shaping and shading that turned Mariane's book, subtitled The Brave Life and Death of My Husband, Danny Pearl , into A Mighty Heart , the noble project starring Angelina Jolie, qualifies in itself, I suppose, as a kind of media success. This respectful, committed, on-the-side-of-right dramatization got made because it stars one of today's most headline-grabbing actress-celebrities. (As a promotional bonus, Jolie's equally eye-catching partner, Brad Pitt, is one of the producers.) And because Michael Winterbottom directed, drawing on his blunter global docudrama style (The Road to Guantánamo ) rather than his fanciful playtime style (Tristram Shandy: A Cock & Bull Story ), the movie strides ahead with a good sense of rhythm, rocking backward just when relief is needed to create vignettes of happier moments in the Pearls' life as an attractive couple to offset the despair of the present and horror of the future. (We know it's coming; thank goodness we're spared the full documentation.)
But because A Mighty Heart  stars Jolie  her skin somehow polished to reflect Mariane's Afro-Cuban/Dutch complexion, her wig a masterpiece of a casually corkscrewed updo, her accent the work of a good student  it's impossible not to be conscious of her performance at every turn. Her intensity, combined with the aura of her celebrity, becomes the story  and the character of the actual Danny Pearl (Dan Futterman, a spot-on physical match) recedes in importance. Thus when Mariane expresses frustration with the investigation, even though a team of Pakistani counter-terrorism officers, led with devotion by a man called only Captain (The Namesake 's terrific Irrfan Khan), are working around the clock, we focus on her pain rather than their hard work. When Mariane turns for support to Danny's boss, John Bussey (Half Nelson 's fine Denis O'Hare), to friend and colleague Asra Nomani (Bend It Like Beckham 's Archie Panjabi), and to Danny's parents (allowing screenwriter John Orloff to emphasize Danny's pride in his Jewish heritage), her needs dwarf the value of their compassion. And when Mariane receives the news she's been dreading and to which the entire movie has been building, the actress in the role dissolves into a keening grief so busy that audience attention wanders at exactly the wrong time to thoughts about how many takes the shot required, and why a moment so obviously devastating affects us in the head but not in the gut.
Winterbottom's A Mighty Heart  focuses on the grim stretch between the time Danny Pearl never returned for dinner (he had set off to interview a shady source) and the time, weeks later, when grisly confirmation of death arrived. Mariane Pearl surely wasn't passive during that time  she worked her sources and attended to her health for the sake of the baby growing inside her  but neither was she the real story. Daniel Pearl was, and the kind of work he did, and the reasons for the seething unrest in the country in which he was a visitor. At the very least, the story is the search to find one missing journalist, just one  among hundreds in peril around the globe. The twisting of narrative perspective that pushes the missing man's wife so insistently into the foreground makes A Mighty Heart  a mighty challenge. Despite the best of intentions, an actress who makes her own headlines gets in the way of the big picture.

 Is it too early for a movie about the short, charmed life and horrible death of Daniel Pearl? It’s a fair question, raised in echo of those voices that several years ago worried if it were too early for a movie about Sept. 11. Like all those who died that day, Mr. Pearl was a casualty of Islamist hatred of Western civilization. And, much as with those other terror victims, his murder has now inspired a mainstream movie meant  to entertain as much as to instruct and enlighten, a movie that will be seen by some as vulgar proof of that same civilization’s willingness to turn a buck on everything, including tragedy.  And make no mistake, despite its pseudo-documentary grit and the imprimatur of the midcult art-house director Michael Winterbottom, “A Mighty Heart” is a precision-tooled Hollywood machine. Based on the memoir by Mariane Pearl, it was bankrolled by a studio division and comes attached to two of the biggest stars in the world, Brad Pitt, who served as one of its producers, and his partner and the film’s heat-seeking star, Angelina Jolie. For some, these boldface names will be reason enough to snigger. But snigger too loudly and you may miss that “A Mighty Heart” is effectively fashioned, as jolting as it is polished, as well as a surprising, insistently political work of commercial art.  Ms. Jolie is clearly the glittering lure here, of course, as much a distraction as a pitifully easy target. That’s too bad, because fine as she is, what distinguishes “A Mighty Heart” is its assertion that politics and ideology play a part in poverty and terrorism, in the way some men exploit human misery in the name of God and righteousness.  It’s the movie’s insistence that politics are integrated into the warp and woof of life, rather than something you wear like a campaign button, which gives pause. Unlike “United 93” and “World Trade Center,” in which terrorism is only a criminal act —  without context, without history, without purpose —   “A Mighty Heart” underscores the idea that Daniel Pearl’s murder was as much an act of political theater as a personal catastrophe.  Personal politics were a driving force in Daniel and Mariane Pearl’s life together. Young, beautiful, in love and expecting  their first child (a boy, Adam), they landed in Karachi, a sprawling Pakistani port city on the coast of the Arabian Sea, on Sept. 12, 2001. They were  journalists: She mostly worked for public radio and television in her native France;  he filed for The Wall Street Journal. The year before, Mr. Pearl, 38, seen mostly in flashback and played by a serviceable Dan Futterman, had become the Journal’s South Asia bureau chief. Mr. Pearl liked to be in the thick of things (he covered Iran for years), but he was cautious too. For him, it appears, the great adventure was being in love.  That, at any rate, is the story that Ms. Pearl tells in her painful book, written with Sarah Crichton. Published the year after her husband was beheaded, after his body was cut into 10 pieces, buried and recovered, the memoir is a tenderly intimate portrait of two remarkable people. Adapted for the screen by John Orloff (“Band of Brothers”), the movie follows the arc of the memoir in sweep and faithful detail. The day before the Pearls were to leave Karachi, Danny  went off to interview an extremist cleric. Instead, he was kidnapped in a complex plot partly engineered by the British-born Ahmed Omar  Sheikh,  who had spent years in an Indian jail for taking foreigners hostage in a bid to free  imprisoned Kashmiri separatists.  Mariane, six months pregnant, waited for her husband. In a short time she was joined in her ordeal by an alphabet soup of Pakistani and American intelligence and counterterrorism types. Among the most important were Randall Bennett (Will Patton, perfect and perfectly creepy), an American security officer who worked at the United States consulate, and a Pakistani that Ms. Pearl calls the Captain (the great Indian actor Irrfan Khan), the chief of that country’s counterterrorism unit. Together with this swarm, Ms. Pearl and another Journal reporter, Asra Q. Nomani (Archie Panjabi), set up a war room in the house where the Pearls were staying with Ms. Nomani. They chased leads, pored through Danny’s  files  and waited some more.  Structured like a police procedural, the movie has the metabolism of a thriller (it’s quick, quick, quick), the bursting heart of a romance and the brains of, well, some very clever people. Just how clever is best evidenced by the way this star vehicle tries to pretend that it isn’t one. Mr. Winterbottom, a canny chameleon whose defining aesthetic signature as a director is that he doesn’t have one, makes a show of working around the gorgeous 800-pound gorilla parked in the center of his movie, mostly by the strategically spare use of close-ups. But even when he’s showing you the back of Ms. Jolie’s corkscrew-curly head, which he does repeatedly, you never forget whom you’re watching.  And, really, why should we? Some of us  may remember Daniel Pearl or at least his gruesome execution, but everyone knows Ms. Jolie:  That’s why stars were invented. Like all big movie stars, she  can’t disappear into her role for long; rather, she bobs to the surface of our consciousness, recedes, bobs to the surface, recedes. Her celebrity bequeaths the movie its capital “I” importance, but her wild stare also affectingly  suggests the tumult beneath Mariane’s preternatural calm. After she appears on CNN to plead for Danny’s  safe return, someone mutters that you wouldn’t know that this dry-eyed woman’s husband had been kidnapped. But why the American need for tears?  Ms. Pearl asks. She wasn’t sad; she was furious.  “A Mighty Heart” is wrenching, but it’s the buzzing undercurrent of anger that makes it most true to its source. Time and again, Mr. Winterbottom plunges his jittery camera into the chaos of Karachi, into the noisy streets crowded with men and notably absent many women. This was the disorienting, alien and often frightening world into which Mariane and Daniel Pearl, a French Buddhist and an American Jew, willingly and bravely jumped. Although Ms. Pearl insists that her husband was also a cautious man up until the day he was kidnapped, maybe they were a little reckless. But they were fired up by a shared belief that journalism could help make the world better, a chokingly poignant idea in these shockingly cynical times.  That may be naïve, but idealism is a form of resistance. And in its modest, at times awkward, way, this little movie with the big movie star tries to bring us into a conversation that, at least in this country, is often relegated to the bummer front pages of your daily paper or glimpsed on television in between diet tips and, yes, news about Brangelina. It’s a difficult conversation at times, and to its credit, the movie doesn’t shy away from just how difficult, specifically in a horrific scene that shows a man being tortured for information about Danny’s  whereabouts. Mr. Pearl would have probably been appalled that this outrage was committed on his behalf; the point is, we should be too.  “A Mighty Heart” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying  parent or adult guardian.) The film contains verbal obscenities; Mr. Pearl’s death is not portrayed on screen.

The sad saga of slain Wall Street Journal reporter Danny Pearl has made it to the bigscreen with facts, figures and beating heart intact in "A Mighty Heart." In his first studio venture, Michael Winterbottom coaxes forth a staggering wealth of detail from this terse, methodical account of Pearl's kidnapping and murder in Pakistan, seen through the eyes of those who sought his return. Given audiences' resistance to films dealing with 9/11 and its aftermath, soberly restrained pic reps a mighty tough sell, though Angelina Jolie's performance as Pearl's widow should broaden prospects for the June 22 Stateside release.

Adapting Mariane Pearl's harrowing memoir, director Winterbottom, who previously ventured into Mideast politics with "In This World" and "The Road to Guantanamo," proves to be just the man for the task. Though the prolific British chameleon isn't one to make the same film twice, his gifts for docudrama storytelling -- an ability to shepherd complicated narratives, avoiding every opportunity for sensationalism in favor of a low-key mounting dread -- couldn't be better suited to the material.
Having covered the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan following the Sept. 11 attacks, the Pearls were working as journalists in Karachi, Pakistan, on Jan. 23, 2002 -- the day Danny ("Capote" scribe Dan Futterman), chasing a story about foiled shoe bomber Richard Reid, got into a cab and never returned. Sticking close to the very pregnant Mariane (Jolie), pic recounts the restless five-week search for the man's whereabouts and his kidnappers' identities, all accompanied by a hailstorm of media attention.
Screenplay crisply diagrams the labyrinth of false leads and fruitless interrogations with various middlemen Danny may have had contact with on the night of his disappearance. Suspicion ultimately comes to rest on the elusive Omar Saeed Sheikh (Alyy Khan), a known Islamic militant with a history of kidnapping foreigners.
Like his fellow suspects, Sheikh is seen only briefly, and in the most objective possible light. Working in the brisk, discursive style of a police procedural, Winterbottom scrupulously follows the rescue effort, step by agonizing step -- ensuring that the audience is never given additional information despite its foreknowledge of the tragic outcome. Even larger political questions -- the implications, say, of a scene in which a Pakistani suspect is strung up and interrogated, or the grim irony of a journalist couple facing intense media scrutiny -- are subjugated to the flow of the storytelling.
Along the way, pic also manages to sketch vivid portraits of Mariane's key supporters and allies. These include Danny's tough-minded colleague, Asra Nomani (Archie Panjabi); a local cop (Irrfan Khan), known simply as Captain, determined not to let the case soil Pakistan's reputation; American diplomatic security agent Randall Bennett (Will Patton), who tends to see the silver lining in all bad news; and Wall Street Journal higher-up John Bussey (Denis O'Hare), who arrives in Pakistan after news of the ordeal, a comforting but resilient figure.
But this is ultimately -- and very intimately -- Mariane Pearl's story, and much of it rests on Jolie, who fits comfortably into the naturalistic mold that shapes the entire ensemble. Though Jolie sports a big belly, a high-coiffed hairstyle and a very challenging accent (raised in France, Mariane is of Afro-Cuban and Dutch descent), this isn't the sort of commanding star turn in which the performer vanishes behind a well-known celebrity mask, but rather a subdued, carefully considered portrait of a woman caught between premature grief and persistent hope.
Jolie plays Mariane as sharp and prickly, but also highly principled and completely devoted to her husband. Wisely, Winterbottom opts to shoot her more high-pitched outbursts from a distance or in near-darkness, as if refusing to milk more histrionics than necessary.
Occasional subdued flashbacks to happier days from Mariane and Danny's marriage, including a very brief love scene, add emotional texture even as they take something away from the film's otherwise unsentimental approach.
Pic negotiates its way around another potential landmine -- to show or not to show the widely circulated video of Pearl's murder -- re-creating a very brief, non-graphic snippet of the contentious footage and getting the facts across with the utmost restraint.
Shot on location in Pakistan, India and France, the film gains considerable authenticity and momentum from its handheld HD lensing by Winterbottom's regular d.p., Marcel Zyskind, and Peter Christelis' rapid editing, rarely allowing a shot to last more than a few seconds.

A skilled actor vanishes into a role; a movie star appropriates it. As presence trumps character, the star personifies Brecht's alienation effect, and whatever its ostensible subject, the movie becomes a vehiclethe latest installment in an ongoing career or, in the case of a great star, a public myth.
Angelina Jolie  is the major alienation effect in A Mighty Heart, although she's not the only one. The hectic pizzazz with which hired gun Michael Winterbottom  directs this tale of terrifying terrorism is another distractionand so is the movie's true-life premise. An addendum to last year's 9/11 movies and a sequel of sorts to Winterbottom's Road to Guantánamo  , A Mighty Heart  is based on one of the most disturbing events of the 9/11 aftermathnamely the case of Wall Street Journal   reporter Daniel Pearl , abducted by jihadi extremists in Karachi  and, five weeks later, brutally executed on video, in part because he was a Jew.
A mondo-global, insanely urgent, staccato procedural in which each shot arrives like a bulletin, A Mighty Heart  is characterized by sensational, quasi-documentary location work in swarming Karachi and a sense of near-constant frenzy. Pearl's briskly staged abduction sends the movie into controlled chaos. The crime triggers a dense montage of flashbacks and action cuts, accompanied by head-spinning techno-babblea manhunt with a half-dozen agencies busily tracking e-mails and cell-phone calls.
After his capture, Pearl ( Capote writer Dan Futterman ) appears only in flashbackdespite a few video teases, the movie resolutely refuses to show him in captivity. A tough Pakistani cop (Irfan Khan ), wholly committed to the case and willing to torture prisoners when necessary, serves as a minor hero. But the heart of the movie, of course, is Pearl's wife Mariane (Jolie), seven months pregnant and compelled to endure the torments of the damned. Based on Mariane's memoir, the movie is true to her clear-headed politics, even while refracting them once more through the media's rainbow prism and the glamour baggage that its star necessarily brings.
Oscar notwithstanding, Jolie belongs less to Hollywood  than the magic kingdom of publicityin Cannes , where A Mighty Heart  had its world premiere, she was referred to as the planet's most photographed woman. Google  serves up 358,000 wildly clashing images. Over the past decade, her persona has mutated from tattooed Goth girl to possibly incestuous cyber-dish and Esquire 's "sexiest woman alive" to its current, suitably contradictory statemost fully expressed by Kate Kretz 's five-by-seven oilpainting Blessed Art Thou , in which, posed as the Virgin Mary , a beatific Angelina and three cherubic children float on a cloud above a Wal-Mart  check-out line. Jolie is Our Lady of Humanitarian Narcissism: Not we but she "are the world," good deeds illuminating her divine person in a blinding blaze of glory.
A Mighty Heart , which was co- produced by Jolie's consort, Brad Pitt , is the celluloid equivalent of Blessed Art Thou . Jolie's Pearl is an almost mystic presence; not since Lara Croft   has the actress had so apposite an avatar. Jolie plays Mariane as an iconher complexion darkened and hair tortured into a perfect mass of ringlets. Jolie as Mariane Pearl  is not as extreme a notion as, for example, John Wayne  playing Albert Schweitzer , or Jennifer Aniston  in the role. As striking and preternaturally poised as she is, Mariane Pearl is herself a great performeras demonstrated when she went on TV to argue for her husband's life.
No less than Jolie, the actual Mariane ascended the red carpet at Cannes; in the movie, her character is imagined as a star. Possessed of an iron will and a miraculous presence of mind, she's surrounded by an entourage yet awesomely solitary in her tragic isolation. When the worst inevitably occurs, no one is able to hug or even comfort hershe goes off alone. The movie is fundamentally a solo, and the creepiest thing about A Mighty Heart  is the ease with which this terrible tale becomes a meditation on divadom. A limited actress but an overwhelming presence, Jolie cannily saves all emotional fireworks for her big scene.
Has Daniel Pearl been eclipsed? Blame Brecht. As Mariane, Jolie not only thinks faster but looks better than anyone else. Whatever happens, she's never less than gorgeous. There's hardly a moment when Jolie is on-screen that you can't sense the presence of make-up artists and hair stylists hovering anxiously just off frame.
