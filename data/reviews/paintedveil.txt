         "The Painted Veil" is a story of gruesome revenge exacted with bloodcurdling politeness. Other things happen in it too. There is growth and redemption, incredible scenery and beautiful piano solos. But a mild-mannered English bacteriologist who drags his frivolous young wife to a remote Chinese village in the grips of a cholera epidemic as payback for her affair with a vice consul — it's just the kind of story that naturally pricks up the ear.
 
  Which is why it's strange that in bringing W. Somerset Maugham's intensely psychological novel to the screen for the third time (the first two adaptations starred Greta Garbo, in 1934, and Eleanor Parker, in a 1957 stinker called "The Seventh Sin"), director John Curran and screenwriter Ron Nyswaner remain at a British remove, as if finding it too, too beastly to pry into the whole sordid business. The handiest explanation is that the project really belongs to its star, Edward Norton, who as a producer worked for years to bring it to fruition and may have been reluctant to play the desperate weirdo.
 


         






    It's 1925, and Kitty (Naomi Watts), a pretty society girl drifting into embarrassing spinsterhood (according to her rapacious mother), marries a shy scientist named Walter Fane (Norton) just to settle the business. Fane works in a government lab in China and whisks Kitty off to Shanghai (changed from Hong Kong in the novel for production reasons) as well as a bacteriologist can be expected to whisk anyone anywhere. We never get to judge his whisking skills, though, because the major developments in the story are dispatched with such clinical expediency they're practically redacted to a clerk. Kitty meets Walter, he proposes. Kitty overhears her mother disparaging her prospects. Cut to Shanghai. Kitty meets the charming Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber) at a party, hello, that was fast. The first love scene between Charlie and Kitty also doubles as the scene in which the lovers are caught in flagrante 
— it's as though a flock has been annihilated with one stone. There's no evidence of the lovers' exquisite torture or cuckold's torment, for instance, that lent "The English Patient" its inexorability and tragic dimension.
 
  By the time Kitty and Walter get to the tiny village of Mei-tan-Fu, you aren't very invested in the tale of spiritual redemption to come. You barely know these people.
 
  That's too bad, because watching it, it's hard to see this lush and stately adaptation, shot in China by Stuart Dryburgh ("The Piano") and scored by Alexandre Desplat, as anything other than a missed opportunity for some prime psychological spelunking into the dark regions of the soul, where Fane has pitched his tent and chained poor Kitty to the pole. We know he knows that Kitty didn't love him when she married him. We know he knows they have nothing in common. He is interested in microscopic germ behavior; she is interested in the social goings-on of British bureaucrats in Shanghai, or macroscopic germ behavior.
 
  If there's a burning mystery here, it's what, exactly, Walter is thinking when he volunteers for the Godforsaken medical post at Mei-tan-Fu, forces Kitty to come with him under threat of an ugly public scandal, then takes the arduous land route despite the ready availability of riverboats and declines to inoculate them despite the fact that cholera has wiped out the bulk of the village. Their neighbors, Deputy Commissioner Waddington (Toby Jones) and the Mother Superior (Diana Rigg) of an order of French nuns, assume the couple is so in love that they couldn't bear to be separated. The irony isn't lost on Kitty, but what effect it has on her isn't really clear. Despite a few short bursts of anger, she keeps her despair in check. Thanks to the nuns, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Or, anyway, gets out of the house and helps with the orphans.
 
  Either way, she comes to life, which is a wonderful thing to watch Naomi Watts do. In the movie's best scene, she gently chides Walter, reminding him that she's human and consequently makes mistakes. Presumably, she's letting him know that she can't be studied, predicted or contained like his bacterium friends. The opening credits are a lovely optical blend of at least two recurring symbols in the story, tiny organisms swirling under a microscope and flowers blooming and dying, but a little narrative device might have gone a long way in adding texture to the story. A tragic love story set against massive social upheaval ... the rise of a nationalist China....
 
  "The Painted Veil" has all the elements in place to be a great epic, but it fails to connect, to paraphrase Maugham's contemporary E.M. Forster, the prose with the passion. It's impeccable, but leaves you cold.

 It’s no surprise that one of the best scenes in the latest and third film iteration of W. Somerset Maugham’s novel “The Painted Veil” doesn’t happen in the book. It’s the 1920s, and as China seethes with revolutionary unrest and cholera, an unhappily married British couple, played by Naomi Watts and Edward Norton, drift into a new state of coexistence, carried aloft on opium smoke and their newly liberated desire. It isn’t Maugham, but it’s mildly steamy and pleasurable, and it gives Toby Jones, who had the unhappy task of playing Truman Capote in the most recent Capote film, the chance to prove that he can do that decadent British thing just as well as Jeremy Irons. And he can.  First published in 1925, “The Painted Veil” recounts the moral awakening of a vain, careless young woman, Kitty (Ms. Watts), who has been raised for a life of abject uselessness. Thrown into a panic after her younger sister marries, and encouraged by her revolting mother, Kitty hastily marries a bacteriologist, Walter Fane (Mr. Norton) and moves with him to Shanghai. The marriage is unhappy, and in time Kitty falls into the arms of a married charmer, Charles Townsend (Liev Schreiber).  The affair brings her to life, and then close to death after Walter discovers her deception and sweeps them off to the countryside plagued by a cholera epidemic. Mr. Jones plays the last white man in the region; Diana Rigg, of all people, plays a nun.  In the 1920s the Chinese backdrop gave Maugham’s story its whiff of exoticism (if not for Chinese readers); these days it’s the overwrought bedroom panting, the social reserve and Kitty’s apparent lack of choices that seem so foreign, like dispatches from some dying planet. This damp fog of repression that informs each personal gesture, every social decision, is also what makes the story seem so unlikely for modern adaptation, particularly when, as is the case here, it hasn’t been refitted with a contemporary hook or allegory for audiences who wouldn’t know Maugham from Edna Ferber. Instead, as nicely directed by John Curran and adapted to the screen by Ron Nyswaner, this version of the story lulls you by turning Maugham’s distaff bildungsroman into a fine romance.  Even better, the new film gives us ample opportunity to spend time with Ms. Watts, whose remarkable talent helps keep movie faith and love alive, even in the tinniest, tiniest vehicles. This version of “The Painted Veil” has been transparently adapted to flatter its leading man, who coaxed the film into existence over a number of years and, with Ms. Watts, serves as one of its producers.  Dry as dust on the page and nearly as hard to grab hold of, Walter registers as a far more robust character on the screen. The novel centers on Kitty and contains large swaths of her cogitating and fretting by way of the third person narration, but the film opens up the story to embrace her and Walter more equally.  An inveterate stealer and masticator of scenes, Mr. Norton is very fine here, especially early on, before his billing gets the better of the story and he begins riding around heroically on horseback. When Walter confronts Kitty with her betrayal, he grabs her arm and with bloodcurdling quiet threatens to strangle her if she interrupts him. Again, this isn’t Maugham; it’s an American actor having his way with a character, beautifully. The British restraint, which Maugham conveys with pages of speeches and even a tiny bow, boils inside this American body like a deep and molten violence. Whether through craft or constitution, Mr. Norton invests Walter with a petty cruelty that makes his character’s emotional thaw and Kitty’s predicament all the more poignant.  Ms. Watts gives Mr. Norton plenty of room and still manages to have her way with “The Painted Veil.” Mr. Curran, who directed her in the film “We Don’t Live Here Anymore,” doesn’t crowd her. We discover Kitty from a distance (much as the character discovers herself), sitting forlornly against an expanse of shockingly bright green countryside and, in flashback, walking across a crowded party with her nose in the air, turned away from earthly matters and the civil-service scientist  hovering in the wings.  Ms. Watts keeps that nose in the air far longer than most actresses would dare. She risks our love and earns our awe, ensuring that we never lose sight of the woman even when the film almost does.  “The Painted Veil” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some mild violence, images of diseased and dying people, discreet lovemaking and drug use.

Intelligent scripting, solid thesping and eye-catching location shooting aren't enough to make a compelling modern film of "The Painted Veil," W. Somerset Maugham's yarn about Brits run amok in 1920s China. Well appointed in all respects, this story of a shallow adulteress's gradual discovery of her starchy husband's worth while battling a cholera epidemic in a backwater village feels remote and old-school despite a frankness the two previous film versions lacked. Cast and some mainstream critical support could launch the Warner Independent release to a respectable commercial life.
Maugham's novel, one of his numerous works about Westerners come to grief in the Far East, was published in 1925. MGM's dim 1934 adaptation, starring Greta Garbo and directed by Richard Boleslavsky, deviated madly from the book, while the studio's 1957 remake, "The Seventh Sin," with Eleanor Parker under Ronald Neame's direction, steered closer to its source but still couldn't engage certain core issues.
Present scripter Ron Nyswaner makes some solid fundamental decisions, beginning with the telescoping down to the barest minimum the London-set opening, in which pretty but undistinguished middle-class flirt Kitty (Naomi Watts) meets and quickly marries serious-minded bacteriologist Walter Fane (Edward Norton) and sets out with him to his posting in Shanghai.
Not remotely in love with her husband, Kitty quickly launches into a passionate affair with the smooth and married British vice consul Charlie Townsend (Liev Schreiber), a relationship Kitty takes far too seriously. When Walter finds out, he punishes his wife by maneuvering her into joining him on a mission to a rural area suffering from an unchecked cholera outbreak, a journey that can be interpreted as a quasi-joint suicide.
Arriving in Mei-tan-fu after days of being carried in chairs (the heat and humidity of the verdant, mountainous region is palpable), Walter all but ignores his guilty wife while he goes about his medical research. Kitty is lucky for the companionship of the local British deputy commissioner, Waddington (Toby Jones), one of those droll, dissolute and seedy representatives of distant empire who through the decades enlivened a stream of books from Conrad and Maugham to Waugh and Greene.
In due course, Kitty's self-centered horizons are enlarged through exposure to the good works of a Mother Superior (Diana Rigg) and a gaggle of French nuns working to help the locals. Kitty also finds she is pregnant, and the way she and Walter deal with the issue of the child's uncertain paternity provides an interesting breakthrough of their stony stalemate, something the previous film versions were forced to avoid due to conventions of the time.
Maugham focused exclusively on the vicissitudes of the colonials, who presumed they were bringing help, enlightenment and civilization to the citizens of an unruly land he portrayed strictly as a backdrop. Nyswaner, director John Curran and Norton, also aboard as one of the producers and prime movers of the project, have made a point of turning China into more of a character in the piece. This they do in part by bringing to the fore the nationalist, anti-English politics of the time, a movement spurred by a real-life British military massacre of Chinese demonstrators in 1925. Angry peasants combined with the cholera make for a volatile cocktail.
All the same, the film is still dominated by the stuffy, repressed personality of Fane, whose emotional stonewalling of his wife produces a stifling of Kitty's naturally more vivacious, if common, personality. Despite the extremes of human experience on view, there is a certain blandness to them as they play out, a sensation matched by the eye-catching but picture-postcard-like presentation of the settings (rural scenes were shot in Guangxi province in southern China).
Even the ultra-capable Norton and Watts aren't fully able to galvanize viewer interest in their narrowly self-absorbed characters. Norton puts on a thin, reedy voice to help express Walter's insecurity and sexual unassertiveness, all the better to contrast with his resolve once faced with dramatic decisions down the line. Watts holds down the story's emotional center, but still finds herself more limited in expression than usual, perhaps from the character's own limitations.
For his part, Jones, who played Truman Capote in "Infamous," seems to have stepped right out of the pages of the novel as the cheerfully jaded civil servant who enjoys illicit delights with his indulgent Chinese concubine. Schreiber overcomes initial suspicion over his casting as a presumptuous, entitled Brit envoy to deliver the requisite confident manliness to awaken Kitty. Rigg's wise, self-sacrificing Mother Superior is a far cry from Emma Peel, indeed.
Pic is a pleasure to look at and listen to, thanks to a fine, supple score from Alexandre Desplat.


Given what an awful stiff Somerset Maugham  can be, it's remarkable how many movies have been made of his uptight tales of civil servants sweating it out in British colonies (48 for the big screen alone). John Curran 's fresh take on Maugham's novel The Painted Veil , from a crisp script by Philadelphia  screenwriter Ron Nyswaner , is sober and delicate but downright buoyant compared to a dull 1934 adaptation starring a miscast Greta Garbo , and a 1957 remake, The Seventh Sin , that tanked on arrival. Edward Norton  makes a pretty impressive stiff himself as Walter, a research doctor who, after marrying up and badly to bored socialite Kitty (a suitably brittle Naomi Watts ), moves to Shanghai , where he immerses himself in the study of infectious disease, while she immerses herself in a caddish vice-consul (Liev Schreiber ). Galvanized out of his insipid servility by jealous rage, Walter hauls the missus off to a cholera-ridden rural outpost, where the two gradually defrost in mutual devotion to duty. Bolstered by a strong ensemble Infamous 's Toby Jones  as a deputy commissioner gone native, and a wonderfully wrinkled Diana Rigg  as a Mother Superior, speaking up for disillusioned decencyand by the ecstatic cinematography of Stuart Dryburgh , The Painted Veil  lifts Maugham's story clear of its prissy, attenuated spirituality, and into genuine passion.
