         Felicity Huffman is such a wonder, at once funny and brave, playing a pre-op male-to-female transsexual in the uneven comedy "Transamerica" that she sustains several lapses that might otherwise have sunk it. But Huffman's portrayal is so extraordinarily endearing and convincing and exquisitely nuanced that her Bree is engaging right to the finish.
 
  What "Desperate Housewives" star Huffman manages is to depict a gender rite of passage that suggests that even a man convinced he is a woman trapped in a male body has had to learn how to express his femininity — and more important, to discover his humanity along with what kind of woman he will become.
 


         






    Born Stanley, Bree has already undergone all the steps to becoming a woman except for the actual gender reassignment surgery. Bree has emerged as an angular, trim, middle-aged woman of self-conscious femininity and of prim and prissy demeanor who is rarely clocked as a transsexual. (Danny Glicker's costumes are a major assist: at once fluffy yet proper.)
 
  Thankfully, she has an astringent sense of humor to offset her grandiosely precise way of speaking. She is a woman of strongly willed pride and dignity, and much of her life is spent in rising above dismaying situations with a starchiness that is amusing and admirably resilient. Huffman's performance is among the year's most distinctive and detailed.
 
  Already armed with wide-ranging higher education, Bree is working on an advanced degree while supporting herself as a waitress and telemarketer in Los Angeles. She is eagerly looking forward to her surgery when she receives a phone call from Toby (Kevin Zegers), a 17-year-old Manhattan street hustler who's landed in jail and is trying to track down his father, Stanley, whom he has never met and who had a brief affair with his late mother. Bree wants nothing to interfere with her surgery, which took a full year to schedule, but her therapist (always delightful Elizabeth Peña) withholds her legal permission until Bree has met the son she never knew she had.
 
  In a sense this is an unusually elaborate setup for a road picture, during which Bree and Toby become acquainted on an adventure-filled cross-country journey to Los Angeles, where Toby wants to become a porn star. Much of what happens along the way veers effectively between zaniness and poignancy, but director Duncan Tucker miscalculates when he makes a stopover visit with a transsexual group while Bree is passing herself of as a missionary to Toby and hiding the fact that she is his biological father. The inevitable moment of truth to which the entire film is building unfortunately occurs during a development that defies all probability but which Huffman and Zegers, who's up to being cast opposite Huffman, play with selfless daring.
 
  Graham Greene, as a mellow Native American with an eye for Bree, lends the film welcome warmth and charm, but Tucker has directed that most formidable of actresses, Fionnula Flanagan, to go needlessly over the top as Bree's dragon of a mother. (More effective are Burt Young as Bree's laid-back father and Carrie Preston as her younger sister, in the midst of overcoming a drug habit.)
 
  What Bree discovers in her journey with Toby is not only to be courageous but also that becoming a responsive, caring human being is as important as completing her gender transition.

For artistry and degree of technical difficulty, this judge awards Felicity Huffman a 10 for her performance in Transamerica . But as with so many elaborate Olympic sports, this judge asks for clarification: What is the point of the exercise?
You see, in Transamerica , the lithe, quick-witted actress, best known these days for her Emmy-winning membership in the Desperate Housewives  sorority, plays a pre-op transsexual whose birth name was Stanley and who now calls herself Bree. That's to say, Huffman is a woman playing a man in the process of transforming into a woman  a prim, conservative tranny, in fact, with a preference for boxy, church-lady suits. (She appears to share a tragic fashion gene with Tom Wilkinson in Normal .) When Bree is unnerved, she flutters like a girly Southern belle; when she speaks, she further softens her husky alto voice with refined enunciation. Yet Huffman teases out a hint of her character's past maleness in the way the ladylike Bree composes herself  a captivating flight of technique, built from equal parts empathy and skilled control.
Bree lives in Los Angeles, where she's well on her way to final gender-reassignment surgery when she receives a call from someone in New York claiming to be Stanley's son, Toby (WB junior hottie Kevin Zegers, looking nicely hottie-dissolute). The teen runaway, a street hustler currently in jail on a related charge, is looking for his father  and, incidentally, needs to post bail. Toby's late mother, Bree is shocked to learn, was a brief girlfriend from Stanley's male college days.
An undeniably audacious feature debut from writer-director Duncan Tucker with various film festival awards to its credit, Transamerica  plays heavily on the multiple implications of the title. Without admitting her real relationship to Toby, and at her psychiatrist's insistence, she flies to New York and bails the kid out. (Toby assumes she's a missionary who saves lost street youth.) She thinks she'll drop him off at his stepfather's place in Kentucky before returning to L.A. for surgery (tran's America); he thinks he'll travel with her to L.A. (trans-America) to find the father he doesn't know is sitting next to him.
Terrible, soap opera things happen when the duo gets to Toby's stepfather's place. Likewise, the deck is stacked heavily toward pathos when the odd couple arrives on the doorstep of Fionnula Flanagan and Burt Young as the cartoony, disapproving old parents Stanley/Bree thought he/she'd never see again.
So much agony! So many secrets! Such crazy hoo-hahing from Flanagan and Young! Courage is surely required by anyone embarking on a sex-changing journey to personal fulfillment. But the unintended effect of all the melodramatic complications in Transamerica  is, oddly, to distract attention from an understanding of exactly what that courage really costs.
2006 Oscar Nominations:  Best Actress (Felicity Huffman); Best Original Song (''Travelin' Thru'')

In the spirit of holiday community, this week brings two tales of transformative bonds between adults and childrenboth issue movies that encourage viewers to hug the outcasts in their midst.
By far the better of the pair, Transamerica   sounds on paper like a gender-bending Broken Flowers : Days before her final surgery, pre-operative transsexual "Bree" (née Stephen, played with gusto by desperate housewife Felicity Huffman ) is contacted from jail by a long-lost son, the product of her lone sexual encounter as a man. Forbidden from undergoing the knife by her therapist (Elizabeth Peña ) until she resolves her feelings toward parenthood, Bree travels to New York to bail out the teenage Toby (Kevin Zegers )as it turns out, a bizarrely angelic male hustler with a coke problem. Because Bree, posing as a missionary, initially plans to drop Toby with his stepdad in Kentuckyor perhaps because Trans World Airlines   would have made an even dumber titlethere's a long, educational road trip in store for both of them.
As a kind of transsexual Gentleman's Agreement , the movie manages not to belabor the expected trannies-are-people-too message. It's clear that Toby's lifestyle has introduced him to strangers far more discomfiting than Bree. Much of the movie is driven by simple suspense about when she'll reveal her history to him; icky and perhaps audacious, the film exploits the tension between the two leads for maximal (trans-) oedipal anxiety. The relationship scenes are supplemented with casual moralizing, as a parade of weirdness-signifying supporting charactersan American Indian who wears a cowboy hat, a "level four" vegan, a conclave of other transsexualsdrives home the message that you are whomever you want to be.
Nearly everyone mistakes the duo for mother and son, and Huffman, for her part, never fails to convince as a woman. But Oscar push or no, it's hard not to see the casting as somewhat craven. With real hips, real breasts, and soft facial featuresand only a prosthetic penisHuffman doesn't have to stretch much to play a he who's nearly transformed himself into a she. She evokes maleness largely through wrinkles and a baritonenot nearly a gender obfuscation on the order of, say, Hilary Swank 's in Boys Don't Cry , but then, Transamerica 's screwball casting negates the need for that kind of realism. With its genial attitude toward devastating family reunions, the film seems less interested in psychodrama than in aspiring toward a transsexual Flirting With Disaster a similarity reinforced by Bree's funny and spectacularly queasy visit with her mixed-marriage parents (Fionnula Flanagan  and Burt Young ). Pleasant even without reaching much of a destination, Transamerica  leaves the basic impression that it's not as self-satisfied as it could have been.
It could have been more like The Kid & I , for instance. "Loosely based on a true story," say the press notes, although "loosely" might as well have been cut: A washed-up actor (Tom Arnold ) is hired by a billionaire (Joe Mantegna ) to write a True Lies like action vehicle for his 17-year-old son (Eric Gores ), who suffers from cerebral palsy. Given that the movie was actually financed by Gores's fatherArnold's neighborand that the young Gores really does have CP, The Kid & I  qualifies as the most indulgent kind of homemade project, laden with tediously inspirational dialogue and visuals that seem shot through half-fizzled Yuengling. Kudos to Gores, at least, for acquitting himself as an actor, and major tax write-offs for whoever got Linda Hamilton , Henry Winkler , and (briefly) the Governator to appear in this cinematic equivalent of vanity press (directed, amazingly enough, by Wayne's World 's Penelope Spheeris ). All the same, would that The Kid & I  met the same fate as the movie within the movieone showing only at the kid's birthday party.
