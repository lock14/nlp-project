Affleck's feature directing debut is strong on atmospherics and moral quandaries. Based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, the novelist who also penned Mystic River
, Affleck's film is a companion in dark mood to that 2003 award-winning film adaptation. Gone Baby Gone
 is a story that seems to gurgle up from the streets of the working-class Boston neighborhood in which much of it is set. The director's brother, Casey, stars as the film's central character, Patrick Kenzie, a private investigator who's lived on the same neighborhood block his whole life. He and his live-in partner in work and romance, Angie Gennaro (Monaghan), instinctively decline a job offer to find a 4-year-old girl who's been missing for three days but eventually succumb to the pleas of the girl's insistent aunt and uncle (Madigan and Welliver). Patrick feels that although his professional mettle is more of the skip-tracing sort, his knowledge of the streets might allow people with information to talk to him who might not otherwise talk to the cops. The hardcore captain of the police's Crimes Against Children unit, Jack Doyle (Freeman), allows Patrick and Angie to tag along with his detectives on the case (Harris and Ashton), who have yet to turn up any clues. The child had lived with her irresponsible single mother, a coke fiend and a drunk. (Ryan delivers an impressive performance as a wretch of a mother � someone you'd readily nominate for court-ordered sterilization.) One clue eventually leads to the next, and the mystery appears to be solved around the film's halfway point. Yet a stray comment eats at Patrick, and he continues to poke at the case after it's closed. The second half of the film journeys to a dark place, where the question that hovers is whether Patrick � and the audience � can handle the truth. Patrick finds himself doing wrong things for the right reason: for the sake of the child. Gone Baby Gone
 tackles questions that become more and more pertinent in America as each week seemingly brings monstrous news of another atrocious case of child abuse. What is the proper punishment for child abusers and molesters? As a leading man, Casey Affleck (who also co-stars in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford
, which is also currently in theatres) has a nebbishy quality and a mumbly speaking voice that I personally find disruptive to a movie's flow. His brother Ben's career as a film director appears set on a solid course, however. Maybe one day Casey will also make the switch from acting and find his true calling in the film industry.


Welcome home, Ben Affleck - all is forgiven. Yes, even "Gigli."
In adapting Dennis Lehane's 1998 crime thriller "Gone Baby Gone," the Hollywood star has gone behind the camera and rescued his career from the water-cooler ridicule that has dogged it since the days of "Daredevil" and J.Lo. The joke's on us, it turns out; as a director, Affleck has come through with a sharp, morally ambiguous piece of pulp crackerjack.
More impressive, even unique, is the way this local boy uses Boston - the mythic, clannish Boston of writers like Lehane and the late George V. Higgins. "Gone Baby Gone" is a straight-up genre film whose plotting sometimes prompts disbelief and whose dialogue turns to agonized speechifying toward the end. Yet it's anchored throughout by an insider's knowledge of this particular street, that specific turn of phrase, this local actor cast in a key bit part. The sag of a three-decker and the sag on the faces of the people who live there.
"Mystic River" and "The Departed" may be the better movies, in other words (although in the case of "Mystic River" I'm open to argument), but "Gone Baby Gone," which opens Friday, is by far the better Boston movie.
As in "River," a missing child galvanizes the action. This time the victim is a 4-year-old girl, Amanda McCready, and her mother is anything but camera-ready. This doesn't stop NewsCenter 5 and its competition from descending like locusts on the Dorchester side street where Helene McCready (Amy Ryan) lives, the better to snap up prime-time footage of the grieving mom. Even in this early scene you can see what Affleck's getting right: The faces of the neighborhood women are shut down tighter than a storefront security gate.
Patrick Kenzie (Casey Affleck) and Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan) aren't intruders, but they're still viewed with suspicion. Private investigators and lovers, the two are hired by Helene's busybody brother (Titus Welliver) and sister-in-law (Amy Madigan), who in short order inform the detectives that Social Services would have taken Amanda away long ago if anyone considered it the city's business. The cops are on the job, but Patrick and Angie know people in the neighborhood who don't talk to the police.
Reluctantly, they join the investigation; just as reluctantly, the two detectives working the case accept them. Ed Harris as Detective Remy Bressant and John Ashton ("Beverly Hills Cop" and "Midnight Run" - where has this bulldog been since then?) as his partner, Nick Poole, are more familiar crime-movie fixtures, but both actors bring a weary specificity and eyes that have seen it all.
The further everyone digs into Helene's immediate past, the more it stinks: a Haitian drug lord (Edi Gathegi), a bag of missing money, a tortured corpse in Chelsea. "Gone Baby Gone" takes place in the urban cracks where the roaches and the rats live; more than once, the characters leave a bar and you're shocked to discover it's still high afternoon.
When a city's worst impulses are hidden from sight, you have to know the terrain to find them. This is where Affleck's inner map serves him well. Would another director, one from out of town, have filmed a scene set at the Quincy quarries at the Quincy quarries? Does geography matter if you're not from around here?
It does. The Boston in this movie coheres as a town deeply lived-in, with roots so deep and so tangled they can surface miles away - in a quiet suburb, perhaps. Yet those connections are all that make sense of the place, especially since no one's talking. Lehane knows the class and ethnic divisions that balkanize the Hub, and Affleck captures them in a neighborhood kid's vulgar taunt or the flat, cold-fish stare of Helene's friend Dottie (the remarkable Jill Quigg, late of Southie's Old Colony housing projects).
That authenticity goes a long way to making "Gone Baby Gone" work when the plot twists start curling beyond the pale. Even the accents are unobtrusively dead-on for the most part; the way Ryan unprintably describes a smell in a certain apartment should win her an award from the South Boston Citizen's Association. The actress's larger triumph lies in letting us see damaged maternal love hiding beneath the skin of a hateful woman. This is the stuff supporting actress Oscars are made of.
Affleck's not certain what to do about race, though - he is from these parts, isn't he? - and white characters in the book have been cast with black actors (Gathegi, Morgan Freeman as a police captain) in ways that don't feel entirely organic to the tale. Yes, we're a more modern, cosmopolitan city than Lehane and "The Departed" indicate; no, Southie is not now nor ever has been all mook. And, yes, we're still chained to our ghosts. When the great Boston movie is finally made, it will deal with class and race and the past, and no one here will want to see it.
That said, "Gone Baby Gone" gets tantalizingly close. I'd never stopped to consider Casey Affleck as a movie star before, but under his big brother's tutelage, he blooms as a leading man of richly watchable savvy and intelligence. Purists will kick, since this Patrick Kenzie is nothing like the hero of Lehane's four novels: young rather than touched by middle age, slender instead of bulked up, a bit of a yuppie.
The Patrick of the books rumbles like a flatbed truck down Dot Ave. and doesn't let anyone pass; the actor plays the character as a wary diplomat, able to play smooth or rough as circumstances dictate. (Monaghan, unfortunately, is given little to do but look distressed; the book's tough cookie is turned into a limp biscotti.)
Above all, Patrick is a neighborhood kid who grew up and out, who lives among the clan but has his eyes fixed on the horizon. He dresses well; he reads books and people. It's the specific plague of this city to not trust native sons who are "better than they should be," and nothing brings the wrath of a townie down faster than perceived superiority in another person. "I remember you from high school," Dottie tells Patrick before dropping the hammer. "You're still conceited."
You think the director knows something about this? Being "from here" is both a scar and a badge of honor, and you don't throw it over for preppie shirts or Hollywood superstardom without paying a price. It's a complicated thing, this Boston tug-of-war between belonging and ambition, and "Gone Baby Gone" worries at it like a metaphorical bone. 
"You must think you're more from here than me," the New Orleans-born Bressant tells the hero. "But I been living here more than you been alive. So who's right?"
Who's right: The question hangs over the movie like a curse. In its final scenes, after most of the bodies have been cleaned up, "Gone Baby Gone" expands its line of inquiry into a painful moral dilemma that pokes the bruise of class one last time. Is being part of a family, a neighborhood, a city worth the scars they can leave? The answering's easy. It's what you do with the answers that's hard.


In Gone Baby Gone , Casey Affleck plays Patrick, a private eye hired by distraught relatives to find a missing little girl. It's a local thing: Patrick is bred and brined in the same piss and vinegar of working-class Boston as the girl's boozy, druggy wreck of a mother, Helene (The Wire 's Amy Ryan, going hell for leather in a fearless performance). So Patrick (and his partner, played by Michelle Monaghan) understand the ties and lies of neighborhoods that bind  or ought to. But of course, nothing is ever simple  not in the morally murky Beantown thriller from Dennis Lehane on which the movie is based (Lehane went on to write Mystic River ), nor in the character complexities favored by Ed Harris (here as a detective) and Morgan Freeman (as a police captain).
Certainly nothing's simple in the professional arc of Boston local Ben Affleck, making his directorial debut from a screenplay he co-wrote with Aaron Stockard. As a filmmaker, Affleck is in a coltish stage; his characters veer toward speechiness, and in mixing in so many shots of real Boston faces and places, he leans on found authenticity as a crutch to support what he can't yet shape on his own. But in emulating the best  Clint Eastwood's Mystic River , Martin Scorsese's The Departed   Affleck the director shows excellent instincts, not least of which is letting his younger brother, Casey, hold the center as a young guy not as smaht  as he thinks he is.

 For his first time behind the camera as a director, the actor Ben Affleck has chosen a brooding, serious drama about missing children, wayward parents and idealism lost and regained. “Gone Baby Gone” is based on the novel by Dennis Lehane, who wrote the similarly themed “Mystic River,” which Clint Eastwood turned into a modern classic. If Mr. Affleck hasn’t raised his material to that rarefied level, he has taken a satisfyingly tough look into conscience, to those dark places where some men also go astray.  The story wants to break hearts: 4-year-old Amanda McCready, a blond doll, has disappeared without a trace amid the squalor of her South Boston neighborhood. The cops are out in formation, as are the television news vans, antennas raised high and all but trembling for blood. Staring into the cameras, the neighbors eagerly offer ready-made headlines and self-flattering condolences: they’re coming together, everyone loves Amanda. The days tick past and the child’s anxious aunt, Bea (Amy Madigan), seeks  help from a local private investigator, Patrick Kenzie, a squirt who looks as if he just dropped out of college and is played without an ounce of actorly ingratiation by Casey Affleck, the director’s younger brother.  I’m not sure exactly when Casey Affleck became such a good actor. Steven Soderbergh tapped him a few years back for recurring third-banana duties in the “Ocean’s Eleven” films, and Gus Van Sant put him in “Gerry,” his 2002 avant-garde feature,  in which Mr. Affleck  roamed around a merciless desert landscape with Matt Damon, with whom he took turns playing Beavis and Butt-head,  Vladimir and Estragon.  More recently he stole the show from Brad Pitt in the western “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.” One of the unusual things about his performance as Ford was its lack of sentimentality. He didn’t plead the character’s case or remind us of his own humanity; he just played the role.  Most actors want you to love them, but Casey Affleck doesn’t seem to know that, or maybe he doesn’t care. Patrick doesn’t cuddle or kiss up. He takes the job Bea offers despite the reluctance of his live-in girlfriend and partner, Angie (a solid Michelle Monaghan), but he doesn’t look like anyone’s idea of a savior. With his sneakers and jeans and small-man’s swagger, he comes off like one of those toughs who never leave the neighborhood and would sooner swing a bat at your head than at a ball.  Mr. Affleck is already deep into the character right from the start, but neither he nor his director let on all they know about Patrick. There’s something about this guy that needles, that helps keep an already tense story on edge.  Despite its terrible question marks — who stole Amanda and why, is she alive and for how long — “Gone Baby Gone” pays closer heed to the enigmas of soul and heart than to clues and guesswork. There are false leads, dead ends, brandished guns and nightmarish discoveries, as well as shadows and controlled camerawork, but mostly there are human frailties and thrown-away, forgotten lives. The screenplay by Ben Affleck and Aaron Stockard whittles down but  doesn’t reduce Mr. Lehane’s material, pulling out details and types that stick to the screen, including Amanda’s mother, Helene, played by a ferocious Amy Ryan. Talk about not wanting our love! Ugly in voice and deed, Helene is the underclass mother from hell, a hazard, a druggie, a villain in waiting.  Helene is a nightmare, or at least the embodiment of a certain familiar fear: the bad woman (welfare queen) periodically held up as a symptom of some grave social disorder. Working with her supportive, encouraging director, Ms. Ryan plays with this stereotype and our sympathies to the breaking point. Deploying her broad Boston accent like a weapon, she whines and retreats, testing Patrick’s sympathy with each one of her pathetic excuses. It’s a gutsy, sensational performance that adds layers to an already spiky, provocative creation. At first you hate the woman and love the actress, though because Ms. Ryan and Ben Affleck are wise to the ways of scapegoating, you learn why that hate is misplaced.  It isn’t all that surprising that Mr. Affleck is so good with his performers, or at least most of them. The film has been wonderfully populated with character actors like Titus Welliver, who plays Lionel, Helene’s straight-talking brother, and Michael K.  Williams, one of the outstanding  villains from the HBO drama “The Wire,” who shows up here as a friendly cop.  Just as memorable are two unfamiliar faces: the newcomer Jill Quigg, who has a few startling scenes as Helene’s comically, scarily belligerent friend Dottie; and the Boston rapper Slaine,  whose cool, dead-eye performance as the  drug dealer who leads Patrick right into the heart of darkness adds menace to one of the film’s strongest, most harrowing scenes.  Mr. Affleck trips up now and again, mostly with his older, famous peers Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman, who delivers one of the more unpersuasive performances of his career as the head of the police department’s missing-children division. The director does better with Mr. Harris, who plays a hotheaded detective in a distracting hairpiece, though again Mr. Affleck doesn’t control the performance as well as he does those of the other cast members. He also wavers when he lingers too long over the crumpled faces and bodies of what appear to be real South Boston natives.  Even so, one of the graces of “Gone Baby Gone” is its sensitivity to real struggle, to the lived-in spaces and worn-out consciences that can come when despair turns into nihilism. Mr. Affleck doesn’t live in these derelict realms, but, for the most part, he earns the right to visit.    “Gone Baby Gone” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There are several scenes of intense and bloody violence, and a horrifying subplot  involving a pedophile. 

Moral ambiguity is the real star of Ben Affleck's helming debut, "Gone Baby Gone," an involving Boston-set tale of mixed motives, selflessness and perfidy in the wake of a 4-year-old girl's disappearance. Adapted from a novel by "Mystic River" author Dennis Lehane, somber pic radiates a feel for Beantown's working-class Dorchester neighborhood, in and around which two private investigators encounter a morass of motivations. Sharp thesping and conversation-starting themes suggest an honorable career, especially if reviews don't spill too many beans. Miramax release goes out Oct. 19 Stateside. 
Baby-faced, 31-year-old private detective Patrick Kenzie (the director's brother, Casey Affleck) has lived on the same block his whole life. He shares a modest apartment with his professional and romantic partner, Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan). Theirs is a neighborhood where even tykes swear a blue streak and one's high school classmates may not have known there were other career options beyond cop or criminal. Blue-collar vs. no-collar animosity is a given, but there's a code that fluidly straddles all sorts of activity.
Patrick and Angie are roused early one morning by distraught Bea McCready (Amy Madigan) and her husband, Lionel (Titus Welliver). It's been three days since their little niece Amanda was abducted from the apartment where she lived with her single mom Helene (Amy Ryan), Lionel's sister. The possible kidnapping is all over the news, but despite the efforts of Capt. Jack Doyle (Morgan Freeman) and his Crimes Against Children unit, the police haven't made much progress.
Bea wants Patrick and Angie -- whose missing-persons experience consists mostly of tracking down credit scofflaws -- to conduct a parallel investigation. Angie, who cherishes the modest but good life they've built together, is wary of taking on anything that might end with a tiny dead body. But Patrick feels his contacts and the fact he doesn't carry a badge can help.
Doyle reluctantly agrees to let Patrick and Angie tag along with seasoned cops Remy Bressant (Ed Harris) and Nick Poole (John Ashton). The quartet learn that an impressive amount of money belonging to a scary local drug dealer went astray not long before Amanda vanished.
There seems to be a connection and, despite Doyle's indignation, unorthodox plans are made to trade the cash for the child. The case seems to have been more or less resolved roughly one hour in, but Patrick can't shake a niggling discrepancy in something one character said. Tortuous though it is, uncovering the truth proves easier than deciding what to do with the information.
With this perf and his turn in "The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Casey Affleck shows low-key but potent acting chops to be reckoned with. Harris is another standout in a well-cast ensemble, and Ryan makes an almost certainly unfit mother -- whose drinking problem is dwarfed only by her cocaine habit -- seem real as well as negligent.
Helmer Affleck establishes and maintains an omnipresent sense of place, advantageously enhanced by little-known local thesps, thoughtfully lensed locations and vivid cutaways to local denizens. The feeling that even the deepest shared-roots camaraderie comes with veiled threats permeates the proceedings.
Pic's only substantial shortcoming lies in the story itself: The logistics of one attempted good deed seem unlikely to withstand the test of time, perhaps not even immediate scrutiny.

"Down these mean streets a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid," Raymond Chandler  wrote in 1950's "The Simple Art of Murder," smacking the ascot off the drawing-room mystery and all its crime-solving dilettante dandies. "He must be . . . a man of honor, by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it, and certainly without saying it." Chandler was laying down the archetype of the hardboiled detective, the hero with a thousand trench coats; he might as well have been summoning Patrick Kenzie , the dark-city crusader of Ben Affleck 's Gone Baby Gone , who hails from the broken glass of Boston's hard-knock Dorchester  district.
From the moment Kenzie, played by Casey Affleck , promises a hard-living skank named Helene that he'll find her missing girl, we know he's going to make good on it or die trying. That's what the heroic shamus does in detective fiction: He honors the code a creed somewhat more refined than the law of the jungle, with a higher return of something like justice. But the great strength of Gone Baby Gone , adapted from the fourth book in crime novelist Dennis Lehane 's series, is its ruthless undermining of the juvenile good/bad certainties of that code. In his strikingly downbeat directorial debut, Affleck has created something of a blue-moon rarity: an American movie of genuine moral complexity.
Aided by girlfriend/girl-Friday Angie Gennaro  (Michelle Monaghan ), Kenzie goes trawling for the little girl through an underworld of roughneck bars and drug hideouts, earning the skeptical regard of a transplanted Cajun cop (Ed Harris , all macho authority) and the wary stink-eye of a police chief (Morgan Freeman ) whose interest in the case is as personal as it gets. Scared of sliding down a shit trail with nothing but slime and sorrow at the bottom, Angie fears the worst. Kenzie can't let it go. He's made his promise.
It's not giving away much to say that the central crime peters out halfway through the movie, after a botched ransom effort brings only shame. But Kenzie continues his investigation and uncovers a conspiracy of other would-be saviors doing seriously ugly things for all the right reasons. They have a code, too. In a grimly ironic reversal of the detective's role as restorer of moral order, the harder Kenzie pokes around, the murkier and more damning his choices geteven the seemingly obvious one of whether to protect the innocent.
As director, Affleck (who scripted with Aaron Stockard ) relishes the close-quarters volatility of Lehane's Balkanized Boston, split along myriad fracture lines of class, loyalty, address, and ethnicity. The novelist's specialty is the neighborhood noir, in which the (usually sordid) history of a place shadows his characters like the whip hand of doom. Whatever the movie version of his Mystic River  may have lacked in grimy location detail, it captured the book's claustrophobia, the inescapable shared past that is the mixed blessing of community.
Gone Baby Gone , by contrast, creates a more turbulent, textured sense of the city as a character. The opening credits' somber street-scene montageless a city symphony than a city threnodysituates the film in concrete particulars even before it rolls up outside the girl's home, a Dog Day Afternoon  madhouse of gawkers, live-at-five news crews, and neighbors momentarily diverted from their grills.
The setting is more persuasive than the plot, which recalls Chandler's gripe that even good detective fiction falls prey to the same contrivances as bad. It hinges upon improbable slip-ups and a naiveté that's unlikely even for the desperate. Indeed, the movie's most generic scenes are all crime-drama standard-issue, although Affleck does invest a familiar ambush scenario with the nerve-rattling use of limited perspective and convincing confusion.
Where Affleck proves unfailing, though, is in the superbly scaled performances he elicits from his cast, free of the operatic overplaying that occasionally edged Mystic River 's needle into the red. That starts with brother Casey, a major talent coming into his own, whose strangled voice and stifled calm make Kenzie a compellingly fallible guardian angel; it goes double for the brilliant Amy Ryan , who embodies Helene as a pathetic, needy creature.
Typically, we want detective fiction to translate aberration into a solvable puzzle. Gone Baby Gone  instead saves its bleakest ethical quandary for last. Faced with two wrenching choices, Kenzie must weigh his own sense of right against what may be a greater good. Yet either way, justice will be shafted and lives ruined. The backbone of the detective's codethe restoration of orderhas rarely seemed so hollow. The ending resonates cruelly in this time of war, as our national susceptibility to clear-cut good/bad options keeps us from frankly considering (or avoiding) likely choices of bad or worse. But that is the scorched earth the detective walks. "It is not a very fragrant world," Raymond Chandler wrote, "but it is the world you live in."
