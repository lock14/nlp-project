Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist
, based on Rachel Cohn and David Levithan's infinitely readable he said/she said young-adult novel, wants to be loved at least as much as the soulful and ingrown indie hipsters of its title. But all I can seem to muster, post-screening, is a modicum of fondness and a probably impermanent relief that the film isn't anywhere near as awful as it might have been in less capable hands. Director Sollett, who helmed the fine Raising Victor Vargas
 back in 2002, keeps things real almost to the point of emotional withdrawal, which was surely his intent: Emo kids are, if anything, emotionally constipated, which makes for terrifically engaging bands but precious little dialogue. Nick (Cera) and Norah (Dennings) are a pair of bridge-and-tunnel teens (they both hail from Englewood, N.J.) who meet cute while out on the town searching the East Village and Brooklyn for a supersecret show by too-cool-for-school band Where's Fluffy? (a faux band moniker that rivals Reality Bites
' Hey, That's My Bike for sheer cultural inscrutability). Nick, mourning the fact that he's been dumped by sexy, shallow ex Tris (Dziena) by burning endless mix CDs for his departed, is dragged out of his self-pity party and thrust into the gorgeous neon of the New York night by his gay bandmates, who vow to hook him up with someone new by the end of the night. Enter Norah, a velvet-roper born of music-business royalty who convolutedly ends up sharing Nick's bedraggled Yugo as the new pair-to-be search for Fluffy and Norah's wasted best friend Caroline (Graynor). Comparing iPods, Norah recognizes a kindred spirit in the woeful Nick and immediately the big question isn't Will they? but When
 will they? (and where the hell is Fluffy?). Cera builds slightly on his Superbad
 template of sensitive geek, and Dennings is darkly luminous as the already jaded Norah, and the film certainly captures the magic of that perfect night out during which anything can happen and, of course, does. But the spark at the heart of Cohn and Levithan's novel seems dampened here, and between Nick's endless dithering over his scheming ex and Norah's supercool pout, the film never quite reaches the heartfelt heartache heights of, say, the many, many indie darlings (Vampire Weekend, Devendra Banhart, We Are Scientists) that litter the soundtrack like so many skinny jeans at a Spoon show. There's love in the air, sure, but it's so slight and ephemeral it might as well be the Strokes' career, and, as far as NYC nights go, it's got nothing on either John Hughes' teen-angstgasms or, especially, Martin Scorsese's far juicier, often overlooked, midnight masterpiece After Hours
. It's like looking through a dreamy, indie-mope kaleidoscope at a party you're not invited to, and, frankly, not even sure you'd want to attend.


'Nick and Norah' chases love through streets of New York
"Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" appears to have everything going against it. It's based on a slim, much-liked young adult novel of the sort that's easy to screw up. It appears bolted together from parts scavenged from old John Hughes films, "Before Sunrise," and "Juno" (from which it swipes both a leading man and a poster font). Worst of all, it's one of those iPod-shuffle movies that leans on its soundtrack instead of its script. Says so right in the title.
So why do I like "Nick and Norah" enough to grade it on the curve? Why might you, if you're willing to let your guard down?
It's not just because of Michael Cera, who plays Nick with the same startled passive-aggressive stare that got him through "Juno." Cera - possibly a one-trick bunny as an actor, but for now the bunny's still really cute - is cast as a New Jersey hipster-nerd reeling from getting dumped by pampered mean girl Tris (Alexis Dziena of "Broken Flowers" and TV's "Invasion").
He obsessively creates please-reconsider-baby mix tapes that she tosses over her shoulder; these are scooped up by Tris's schoolmate Norah (Kat Dennings), who hasn't met Nick but is convinced he's her musical soul mate. A long night in Manhattan chasing after a secret concert by their favorite underground band brings these two together, then drives them apart, then together, then . . . you get the picture. Aiding and abetting the romance are that galloping soundtrack (Vampire Weekend, Bishop Allen, The Real Tuesday Weld, and other bands you've either never heard of or are already over) and Nick's own bandmates, a cackling Greek chorus of queercore rockers led by Thom (Aaron Yoo).
Is it Dennings as Norah who saves the movie? Partly. The actress, best remembered as Catherine Keener's daughter in "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," resembles a younger, gloomier Kate Winslet, and part of the fun of "Nick and Norah" is watching the character peek out of the shell of her privileged cynicism. She has a secret - not a game-changing secret, but still - and a pleasant user of a boyfriend (Jay Baruchel from "Tropic Thunder"); most of all Norah seems normal, and richly deserving of someone normal too.
Maybe the film works because of Yoo, Baruchel, and other subsidiary characters scampering happily across the movie's field of view. Really, though, Peter Sollett's the reason. The director's first movie, 2002's "Raising Victor Vargas," was a low-budget slice of New York's Lower East Side that had an achingly human ear for the ways young people fool around and fall in love. "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" is Sollett's belated sophomore outing, and it shows him going Hollywood but also pulling Hollywood toward him. He's still in love with love, youth, and Manhattan - for the way the city can remix the rules in one heady night - but this time he's making a fairy tale, complete with magical parking spots for Nick's wheezy Yugo.
A lot of the comedy involves Norah's best galpal, Caroline (Ari Graynor), a party girl who gets drunk early and careens around the city looking for a place to hurl. (She has a wad of gum that by the end of the movie is practically a sidekick.) Graynor's a gifted comedienne but the character's still an "American Pie" extra who has wandered into the wrong movie - she exists to make straight-edge Nick and Norah more appealing. The evil Tris is a sub-Hughes cartoon as well, especially stacked against the charmingly three-dimensional (all right, 2 1/2-dimensional) leads.
Sollett's working with stale material, clearly. He genuinely likes people, though, and his fondness revives "Nick and Norah" and sets it spinning with camaraderie and hope. The generosity of spirit here can remind you of early Jonathan Demme movies or Robert Zemeckis's forgotten 1978 comedy "I Wanna Hold Your Hand" - another tale of bighearted Jersey teens descending on Manhattan in search of the one band that gives life meaning. There it was the Beatles, here it's Where's Fuzzy, and what matters isn't finding the group but the journey there. That and meeting the one stranger who hears life exactly the way you do.


The marvelous, magical boy-meets-girl-in-the-city-that-never-sleeps romantic comedy Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist  is a revolutionary movie disguised as a familiar story. Here, for the umpteenth time, are a couple of young people who straddle the borders between hipster and geek, insider and outsider, reasonably well-adjusted teen and roiling mess of adolescent self-doubt. And on one enchanted night, driving around in a Yugo the pumpkin color of Cinderella's coach after midnight, they find each other. But here, too, for the first time in a long time, are characters who seem honestly rooted in an authentic kids-of-'08 universe. Welcome to a world that may feel like a discovery to any viewer not currently a teen habitué of New York's downtown melting pot of straights and gays and Jews and goys and NYC sophisticates and bridge-and-tunnel gatecrashers, awake at all hours and open to the improvisation and velocity of the new.
Seniors Nick (Michael Cera) and Norah (Kat Dennings) come from different backgrounds  he's a son of suburban New Jersey, the one straight dude in a queercore rock band; she's a privileged, city-dwelling daughter of a record-industry mogul. At first, the pair don't realize that they fit together like the original Nick and Nora in the peerless Thin Man  screwball comedies of the 1930s and '40s, this time bound together by a connoisseur's love of indie rock, hole-in-the-wall Lower East Side clubs that pound all night, a fierce ability to banter, and a luminous goodness. When the two meet cute at one such club, Nick is nursing a bruised heart  a Cera specialty  injured by a shallow bee-yotch named Tris (Alexis Dziena). Norah, who has got a mooching, wannabe-musician boyfriend (Jay Baruchel) somewhere in the wings, knows Tris as a private school classmate and longtime frenemy, but that's not the point: At the moment, Norah is accompanying her hard-partying best friend, Caroline (fearless and funny Ari Graynor), in pursuit of an elusive underground band rumored to be playing somewhere in the city late that night. It's Nick's gay pals who actually recognize that Norah is the girl worthy of their hetero buddy, and the boys engineer the getting-to-know- you circumstances, right down to providing the sullenly pretty, droopily dressed Norah with foundation garments to enhance her delicious figure.
It takes a gay man to offer a woman straight talk about her ''uniboob.'' But one of Nick & Norah's  most radical accomplishments is to incorporate a population of interesting, creative, cute gay guys who lead fulfilled lives that have nothing to do with being any straight person's colorful sidekick. (It's a stunning feat, really, tossed off with ease by director Peter Sollett and screenwriter Lorene Scafaria, working from the novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan.) Another achievement is granting Norah a Jewish identity that's as much an unremarkable, unshticky part of who she is as the fact that she's cool, she loves rock, and she doesn't drink. And a third is that, in the zonked-out person of Caroline (and in the gonzo risks taken by Graynor, an accomplished New York stage actor) the movie offers a whole new feminist angle on the joys of gross-out humor. Wild horses or a speeding Yugo couldn't drag from me the details of Caroline's greatest descent into transgressive yuccckkk ; the whole scene is a tribute to Graynor's gumption, with help from the fluorescent-lit tattiness of Manhattan's Port Authority Bus Terminal, where it all goes down. But come to think of it, so much goes down on Nick and Norah's one enchanted evening that the best advice is to enjoy the ride  the actual ride  around this vibrant new New York. A–

 As thin as an iPod Nano, as full of adolescent self-display as a Facebook page, “Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist” strives to capture, in meticulous detail, what it’s like to be young right now. Working from a popular novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan (and an idiomatically spot-on screenplay by Lorene Scafaria) the director, Peter Sollett, spins a shy, sweet romance around a carefully chosen soundtrack with music (and cameo appearances) by such emblems of up-to-the-minute hipster credibility as the singer-songwriter Devendra  Banhart and the band Bishop Allen, among others.  Nick and Norah, New Jersey high school students bouncing through the rock clubs of New York, are drawn together by their shared musical passions (in particular for an enigmatic band called Where’s Fluffy). The tunes that play alongside their nocturnal adventure express longing, sadness, anxiety and joy with more intensity than they can muster themselves. Nick, played by the wet-noodle heartthrob Michael Cera (“Juno,” “Superbad”) and Norah (Kat Dennings, who has a hint of Kate Winslet’s soft, smart loveliness in her face) are, like so many kids these days, most comfortable with diffidence, understatement and a deadpan style of address that collapses the distinction between irony and sincerity.  Norah’s wary, pouty manner and Nick’s odd mix of timidity and sarcasm are both strategies of self-protection. He has recently been dumped by Tris (Alex Dziena), a schoolmate of Norah’s and one of her social oppressors. She has a sometime boyfriend (Jay Baruchel) and, behind her mask of indifference, a lot of self-doubt. The daughter of a recording industry big shot, Norah is never sure if anyone likes her for herself. Nick, for his part, seems unsure about whether he likes himself at all.  But Nick and Norah are cool, and also nice. Which is cool for “Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist,” and nice for them, but also somewhat limiting. Mr. Sollett shows an admirably low-key directorial temperament, resisting the temptations of melodrama and farce that hover around any teenage romantic comedy. Like “Raising Victor Vargas,” his earlier feature (also about lovestruck young people in Lower Manhattan, but set in a demographic universe far removed from Nick and Norah’s zone of suburban entitlement), “Infinite Playlist” regards its characters with affectionate detachment, and assures its audience that no great calamities or revelations are in store. Instead, there are a series of small crises and tiny epiphanies, all adding up to a story that courts triviality in its pursuit of charm.  The charm is there, not least in the film’s vision of New York as a happy playground for underage night owls. The city’s streets are so benign that Nick’s abandonment of a girl (not Norah) in a desolate spot on the West Side can seem like a forgivable failure of gallantry, rather than an act of passive-aggressive, potentially homicidal malice. Everyone has a cellphone, after all, and the criminals and crazies that used to haunt these neighborhoods are little more than flickering memories from older movies.  Partly because of its structure — it takes place in the course of a single night during which time races, dawdles, pauses and skips — “Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist” may remind you of some older movies. It’s like Martin Scorsese’s “After Hours” filtered through the high school sensibility of John Hughes, or Richard Linklater’s “Before Sunrise” remade for Nickelodeon.  All of which I mean, mostly, as praise. Unlike run-of-the-mill teensploitation comedies that smirk at or condescend to the young, this film is smart about its audience, and respectful of it as well. The language and sexual activity are kept within PG-13 boundaries, but the script, like the book, is calmly candid about what adolescents do and say, sexually and otherwise, in the age of Too Much Information and Friends With Benefits. Neither prurient nor moralistic, “Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist” surveys the varieties of teenage experience with tolerant sympathy, which is for the most part how the characters — gay and straight, reckless and cautious, drunk and sober — regard one another.  Indeed, the movie is so friendly that you may wish for a little more conflict: higher emotional stakes, riskier jokes, a touch of danger in the night air. But maybe those are age-inappropriate preoccupations. Just about everyone in “Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist” seems to be having a good time, and most of them seem like good kids (though Norah’s friend Caroline, played by a scene-stealing Ari Graynor, is probably headed for a stint in rehab). Why begrudge them their fun, or wish premature heartache upon them? There will be plenty of time for the blues later on, which is all the more reason to savor the fleeting, teasing pop pleasures this movie celebrates and dispenses.  “Nick & Norah’s Infinite Playlist” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has profanity, sexual references and situations, and underage drinking.

People with high blood pressure need romantic comedies, too, and their cardiologists will be very grateful for �Nick & Norah�s Infinite Playlist,� a scrubbed-up, nearly somnambulistic night tour of teen-hipster Manhattan. This is the kind of sparsely plotted comedy that depends on compelling characters, but it stars two young actors defined by ironic detachment. Michael Cera and Kat Dennings may bring some young behinds to theater seats, but the number will be finite, as the pic�s energy level is too low for breakout B.O.
That said, it�s refreshing to see a youth-oriented comedy that doesn�t presume its audience has attention deficit disorder, and that believes editing should be determined by a sense of logic, or even by music. �Nick & Norah�s Infinite Playlist� (no connection, or reference, to Dashiell Hammett�s Nick and Nora Charles) strives to give its characters emotional breathing room. Cera, doing what he�s done in �Juno� and �Superbad,� plays Nick, alt-rock bassist, high school student and ex of the evil Tris (Alexis Dziena), for whom he spends his days making moony mix CDs. Norah (Dennings), who despises Tris and adores this unknown boyfriend who makes the mix CDs, has no luck at love.  But she�s recognized on sight by every nightclub doorman in the East Village and Brooklyn (her pedigree is kept secret until later),  and her ability to cut lines is equaled only by Nick�s ability to find a parking space for his taxi-yellow Yugo, directly in front of any place he and his posse happen to be going. (This is a fantasy, of course, so one shouldn�t be persnickety about motor-vehicle sci-fi.)
In the hands of director Peter Sollett (whose acclaimed 2002 indie, �Raising Victor Vargas,� took a less glamorous view of Gotham) and scribe Lorene Scafaria (adapting a novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan), the romantic direction in which the film is headed is never a mystery. 
Nor is it a mystery that a movie like this is inevitably going to be dependent on its peripheral characters: The standout is Ari Graynor as Caroline, Norah�s cocktail-guzzling pal, who spends most of the film in a drunken tizzy, trying to navigate dance floors and, ultimately, the Port Authority Bus Terminal. There,pic reaches its aesthetic low point when Caroline fishes her cell phone and chewing gum out of a toilet that might have been borrowed from �Trainspotting.� 
The characters spend much of the movie hunting down a band called Where�s Fluffy, whose whereabouts are teased on the radio (in what seems to be a reference to �American Graffiti�), sending Nick, Norah and their pals on an inter-borough hunt. Along the way, Nick and Norah are both tempted by ex loves -- Nick by Tris, and Norah by the opportunistic Tal (Judd Apatow regular Jay Baruchel).
This is a formula film, inasmuch as Nick and Norah initially have all the chemistry of Clorox and ammonia but gradually warm to each other, realizing the depths of their simpatico worldviews and musical tastes. 
It�s also a film for tourists -- there are so many glistening skylines, beautiful people and landmark commercial institutions , all shown in glossy advert style, that, in terms of promoting New York tourism, �Nick & Norah�s Infinite Playlist� makes �Sex and the City� seem like �Fort Apache: The Bronx.� It�s sweet, no doubt, but a bit too slick for its own good.
Production values are tops. 



Peter Sollett 's 2002 film, Raising Victor Vargas , remains among the most pointed, poignant, and joyful films about teen love ever made. Everything about it felt special, from its depictions of the Lower East Side of Manhattan to its cast, then-newcomers who seemed to radiate from within as they groped and coped beneath watchful eyes. Now, Sollett can only retrace those steps in this far lesser movie about little more than a boy (Michael Cera , once more in the Michael Cera role), a girl (Kat Dennings ), and their friends cruising the streets of NYC in search of the latest, greatest, hippest band in all the land (a band we never see or hear, incidentally, which shorts the audience of at least one promised reward for making it to the movie's end). From its indier-than-thou soundtrack—larded with the likes of Vampire Weekend , Bishop Allen, and Band of Horses —to its split-second hipster cameos (Devendra Banhart , Seth Meyers , John Cho , Kevin Corrigan ), this after-hours romantic comedy plays like the exact opposite of Victor Vargas  : Where that movie was organic, with every scene hitting just the right note and feeling so magically accidental, Nick and Norah  plays like something crafted in a lab by 54-year-old hucksters trying to sell shit to the kids under the cheerless guise of "alternative." The only thing it's an alternative to? Good.
