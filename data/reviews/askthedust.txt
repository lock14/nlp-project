         Lovers of Los Angeles literature and especially the works of John Fante have long anticipated the arrival of the movie version of "Ask the Dust." That it was entrusted to Robert Towne, of "Chinatown" fame and keeper of a tradition of Southern California writers, has been a source of comfort and high hopes.
 
  Thirty years of gestation have produced a film of great beauty with unfulfilled promise — a disappointment, but with much to recommend and be glad about. It is a reverent treatment of the touchstone novel about tyro writer Arturo Bandini and his adventures in the City of Angels that perhaps clings too closely to the original while neglecting the intricacies of its main character.
 


         






    Colin Farrell stars as the Italian American Bandini, five months removed from Boulder, Colo., and full of youthful bravado. Emboldened by the publication of a short story in a literary magazine, he is inspired and discouraged by his surroundings. The tragic faces of the Midwesterners who've come to L.A. seeking sun-drenched asylum and peaceful death haunt him even as he finds insight in their plight. The bright, corrosive daylight of each new morning drives him into the cover of darkness to stare at his typewriter collecting dust blown in from the distant Mojave Desert.
 
  Towne acknowledges his literary debt up front, panning from a pile of rotting orange peels that share a dish with cigarette ashes to a book that displays the film's opening credits on its turning pages. The painted postcard look of the next shot, downtown Los Angeles at night, establishes the film in the fabulist tradition. The camera swoops from high above Chinatown down to Bunker Hill and the sad denizens of the Alta Loma Hotel.
 
  The film's attitude echoes the doomed romanticism of 1930s melodramas. There's a warmth at the center of its images, courtesy of director of photography Caleb Deschanel and production designer Dennis Gassner, that suggests a longing for the simplicity of the prewar era, the time when orange-crate boosterism met noir cynicism. Where "Chinatown" was all skepticism and corrupted dreams, "Ask the Dust" holds something back for the future.
 
  Bandini is shaken to life by his tumultuous encounter with the enchanting Mexican waitress Camilla Lopez, played with intense passion by Salma Hayek. Down to his last nickel, he visits the cafe where she works, and they immediately begin pushing away from one another like strong magnets. Taunted by the Smiths and Joneses back home, Bandini proudly holds onto his name and all its vowels even as he fantasizes about creamy skinned WASP girls. Camilla doesn't fit his dream and, though drawn to her, he repels her with the same slurs that were hurled at him.
 
  Likewise, Camilla imagines marrying an Anglo and shedding her surname, pointing out that Bandini isn't much of an improvement. The complexities and contradictions in their behavior make more sense in the novel, drawn from the acidic mix of pride and self-loathing.
 
  In the film, the reversals feel more abrupt, less clearly motivated. The relationship thus conveys less about the characters and obscures the larger issues of their clashing identities.
 
  The character of Bandini is a difficult one. A callow mixture of bluster and uncertainty, he writes to his editor, H.L. Mencken (voiced by film critic and historian Richard Schickel) — J.C. Hackmuth in the book — that he can't write about love when he has so little experience. The problem with the casting of Farrell, who is otherwise very good, is that he is nearly a decade too old.
 
  Moving the romance front and center also diminishes the role the city plays in Bandini's journey, which is unfortunate because Towne and his crew pull off an amazing cinematic sleight of hand. The film, remarkably, was shot in Capetown, South Africa, where sets representing Depression-era downtown Los Angeles were erected. Specific locales such as Bunker Hill, the Angel's Flight funicular and the Third Street tunnel are strikingly imagined.
 
  There are also good performances to appreciate among the supporting actors, including Donald Sutherland ("Day of the Locust's " Homer Simpson), evoking the even darker vision of Nathanael West as Bandini's neighbor and Idina Menzel ("Wicked") as the ill-fated inspiration for Bandini's novel.
 
  It's unlikely anyone other than Towne could have gotten the film made, and we'll have to be satisfied with the pleasures of his version rather than thoughts of what might have been. One thing that persists from Fante's novel is the idea of what sets Bandini apart from those who come to Los Angeles to discover their fortune or be discovered themselves. Bandini, as a writer, creates his own destiny and tragic as the outcome may be, he fulfills it.
 
 'Ask the Dust'
 
 MPAA rating:
 R for some sexuality, nudity and language   

Is there any genre more deadly than the ''literary'' film noir? You not only have to endure all that mannered neo-'40s claptrap (murk lighting, venetian blinds, weary narration about dames), you have to watch the stuff being written about, as the author-hero sits at a typewriter and bangs out a story about how his life is turning into...the story he's writing. Save us! Over the years, some very gifted artists have shown a weakness for this brand of hardboiled meta-snooze. In the '80s, there was Wim Wenders' Hammett , and now Robert Towne, the great screenwriter and director (Without Limits , Personal Best ), has coughed up Ask the Dust , in which Colin Farrell, plunked into a grimy bungalow in Depression-era Los Angeles, works so hard to speak in an American accent, and at the same time to exude the authority of an old-movie tough guy, that he winds up sounding like Gary Cooper on Xanax.
As Arturo Bandini, a second-generation Italian who dreams of becoming a famous novelist, Farrell looks just about as starchy and ill at ease as I've ever seen an actor look. And that's before he meets Salma Hayek, as a ''fiery'' Mexican waitress, and in a series of barely coherent love/hate scenes pelts her with ethnic slurs, then falls into bed with her, then tosses some more slurs. Ask the Dust  is based on a celebrated novel by John Fante, and you can see why Towne, with his gothic fixation on the rotting romance of old L.A., would have been drawn to it, but the movie lacks even the misplaced fervor of obsession. It's lifeless kitsch.

   There are all kinds of stories about Los Angeles, that city of broken dreams, terminal sunshine and important car crashes. Among the greatest is "Ask the Dust," an autobiographical novel by John Fante about his hungry years in the city when he lived on pennies, oranges and splenetic ambition. Born in Denver, Fante moved to Los Angeles where, in between novels and stories that deserve to be remembered, he wrote films that are now mostly forgotten. Charles Bukowski considered him a personal saint and in the 1970's helped rescue him from obscurity. Another disciple of sorts is the screenwriter and sometime director Robert Towne, who has turned Fante's glorious howl into a requiem for a city and those who escape its gilded clutches.  Like Fante, Mr. Towne knows plenty about Los Angeles — Hollywood, too, as his résumé, with its official and unofficial triumphs, attests: "Bonnie and Clyde," "The Last Detail," "Chinatown"  and "Shampoo." There have been turkeys, of course, and since the 1970's he has ridden out the changes in Hollywood with mixed results, working on blockbusters with Jerry Bruckheimer. It is in this light that his desire to bring "Ask the Dust," a cri de coeur from a young author bursting with passion and purpose, carries such  aching poignancy. Now 71, Mr. Towne has kept in the game partly through playing by rules that have not necessarily been good for his art. One imagines that, as  was true of Fante, who sometimes put Hollywood before his own work, it hasn't always been easy.  First published in 1939 when Fante was 30, "Ask the Dust" recounts the "lean days of determination" of his favorite alter ego, the preening and furiously proud writer Arturo Bandini, played in the film with surprising conviction by Colin Farrell. Barely published, filled with hope, engorged with rage — at the world, at himself — the 20-year-old Arturo lusts for fame, women and something to eat besides the oranges that make his gums bleed. With a photograph of his mentor, the holy father of American letters, H. L. Mencken, pinned to his wall, he greets the city like a ravenous lover. ("Los Angeles," Fante implores, "give me some of you!") That the city ignores his advances only enrages Arturo further, deepening his hate, strengthening his love.  "Ask the Dusk" was written when Fante was still struggling, and you feel the urgency of the struggle in each line. The film has none of that urgency, despite some sexy thrashing about by Mr. Farrell and his fine co-star, Salma Hayek, who plays the flirty Mexican  waitress Camilla. Their affair consumes much more of the film than it does the novel, which is partly a concession to the reality that all those pages crammed with Arturo's thoughts, observations, digressions and dreams wouldn't easily translate to the screen. But the affair works to another of the story's purposes, too. Camilla isn't just another Angeleno who feeds the fires of Arturo's imagination — as does an overwrought Jewish woman, Vera (Idina Menzel), with whom he has a singularly depressing affair — she is where he finds a sense of self and belonging.  If this version feels considerably less urgent that Fante's, it is largely because of the differences in  age and circumstance of the two storytellers when each told the tale. It's instructive that while some of the exteriors have the hard light of a cloudless Los Angeles day, Mr. Towne and his cinematographer, Caleb Deschanel, imbue other scenes with a honeyed glow reminiscent of one of the city's spectacular sunsets. (The film was actually shot almost entirely in South Africa, a stunning stand-in from beach to desert.) The lighting takes the edge off the story, but Mr. Towne is more a captive to romance than a slave to nostalgia. And, more than anything else, "Ask the Dust" feels like a compendium of desires — for a city, for a woman, for youth — that now warm rather than burn.  After circling each other like famished lions, exchanging ethnic slurs and longing looks, Arturo and Camilla decamp to the beach where, during a dreamy interlude much expanded from the novel, they find temporary refuge. When Arturo  first checked into his hotel on Bunker Hill, his landlady (the excellent Eileen Atkins) sharply explained that she doesn't rent  to Mexicans or Jews. Long before  Los Angeles pasted on its permanent smiley face, such casually open racism was an everyday reality. It burns Arturo, who rages at the Smiths and the Joneses who reject him because of his Italian blood, at himself (he obsessively repeats his full name like a curse) and at the dark-haired woman next to him. In the land of the lotus-eaters, he chokes.  Spleen keeps Arturo going as much as hope and oranges, and Mr. Ferrell, who can sometimes seem lost in his own movies, invests the character with both focus and tenderness. Although Arturo's internal engine runs slower on the screen than it does on the page, Mr. Towne has retained the period flavor of his speech wonderfully well. He lifts words and ideas straight from the novel, gently tempering Arturo's extravagant flights of fancy so they sound more naturalistic coming out of his star's mouth. Timeless in its way, "Ask the Dust" is also very much of its specific moment, as evidenced by the lovingly recreated cheap beachfront cottages, the rumbling streetcars and the Japanese fruit vendor who keeps Arturo's belly full. The unpaved roads fill the air with dust and don't all yet lead straight to Hollywood.  Eventually, of course, they will. By the time Fante wrote "Ask the Dusk," he had already started working in Hollywood, which helped him out of poverty, though at  personal cost. It's hard not to think that this partly explains why Mr. Towne wanted to tell this particular story, to summon up this dreamland of old Hollywood and lost Los Angeles. The beauty of Fante's prose has its attractions, of course, as does angry youth, but what matters here isn't simply and only "Ask the Dust," but also its postscript, the one about a writer whose best work transcended all the compromises, the periods of neglect and wild contradictions. This is only Mr. Towne's fourth film as a director, but after a life of providing beautiful words for other people to say, this was clearly one story he very much needed to tell himself.  "Ask the Dust" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains salty language and nudity.

A film that feels like it's from another time and place, "Ask the Dust" is John Fante's classic novel as if fixed in amber. A long-nourished dream project for Robert Towne, this story of Depression-era down-and-outers in Los Angeles takes place just a stone's throw from the denouement of "Chinatown," with an emphasis on marginal lives that also recalls "The Day of the Locust" and "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" Highlighted by a strong and sensual performance from Salma Hayek as the doomed heroine, elegant pic's muted quality and the central character's vexingly contrary behavior will keep auds from connecting with characters who themselves have trouble establishing bonds. Commercial prospects are soft for the Paramount Classics release.
For decades, unofficial old-Los Angeles dramatist laureate Towne cherished making Fante's 1939 novel, an autobiographical work about the writer's early struggles while living in a Bunker Hill boarding house. Repeated work-for-hire on Tom Cruise projects such as "Days of Thunder" and the "Mission: Impossible" pics evidently earned Towne enough points with Cruise/Wagner for the company to back the venture at Paramount. Ironically, however, due to the modernization of the city, the film ended up being shot in South Africa, where a large set repping Downtown L.A., circa 1933, was built from scratch, with further embellishments courtesy of CGI.
After retro credits on the turning pages of a book, it's modern computer wizardry that is responsible for the spectacular opening shot, one that will delight old-L.A. nostaligists. Beginning high in the hills, with the ocean visible in the distance, the panoramic perspective descends toward a realistically rendered Downtown, finally coming to rest on a room at the dingy Alta Loma, where young Arturo Bandini (Colin Farrell) is down to his last nickel.
Subsisting on oranges and cigarettes, and with the fierce visage of H.L. Mencken, who intermittently publishes his stories peering down at him from a photo on the wall, Bandini is trying to find his voice as a writer.
Ultimately, it's the city streets, and the lonely, wounded and desperate souls who populate them, that will supply Bandini with material. Mainly, there is Camilla (Hayek), a beautiful Mexican waitress at the nearby Columbia Cafe. From their first meeting, they're drawn together, but Bandini can't help insulting her and nipping the latent romantic possibilities in the bud. Bandini even blows it when the two drive out to the beach one night and Camilla initiates a nude moonlight swim.
Through this scene and beyond, Hayek's sexiness is so palpable you can scarcely believe the virginal but experience-seeking Bandini keeps driving such a ripe and available opportunity away. Instead, he develops an odd bond with a desperately insecure Jewess, Vera Rivkin (Idina Menzel).
When Camilla returns to Bandini once more, she rightly accuses him of being afraid to screw her. In retreat, he heads down to Long Beach to visit Vera, only to be caught in the Long Beach earthquake.
Although the ethnic/racial demarcations were present in the novel, Towne has emphasized them further, especially toward the end when everything between Bandini and Camilla hangs in the balance; as Bandini himself was the victim of anti-Italian prejudice in his Colorado youth, Camilla wrongly assumes he can empathize with what she experiences as a Mexican in California. Pic's final stretch, elaborated significantly from the novel, ends things on a flat note.
Bandini's own shortcomings, a tentativeness and faint-heartedness that mix oddly with a kind of hard-headed arrogance, were acceptable on the page because of the character's first-person observational stance. Watching the man objectively onscreen (despite the abundance of voiceover) is another matter altogether; he's hardly the stuff of screen heroes, or even antiheroes, his behavior perplexing and disappointing. Farrell portrays him credibly and well, echoing at times the exuberant youthfulness of his performance in "A Home at the End of the World," but the man remains a muddle of indecision.
By contrast, Hayek is in full blossom as Camilla. She may not be as cheap and bedraggled-looking at the outset as one imagines the character on the page, but the actress soon brings her to full emotional life as she engages in a self-destructive, even if momentarily fulfilling, to-and-fro with Bandini.
Menzel socks over her needy character in some sad scenes, Donald Sutherland represents a living reminder of "The Day of the Locust" as an aged neighbor of Bandini's, Justin Kirk has some tangy moments as Camilla's boss and sometime lover, and Eileen Atkins is on just long enough as the Alta Loma's presiding matron to inform that the august establishment does not allow Mexicans or Jews. Critic Richard Schickel intones the voice of Mencken.
Enormous effort has gone into the production's look, the brownish, desaturated nature of which makes this Los Angeles seem permanently parched by the Santa Ana winds. Dennis Gassner's production design, which includes the famous Angels' Flight, is wonderful to behold even as it gives the picture more of a '30s backlot feel than of one shot on actual locations. Scenes depicting such other locales as Long Beach (including an amusement park) and Laguna Beach are evocative if minimalist, with Caleb Deschanel's camera deliciously illuminating the settings and the leading players, who have been costumed to a tee by Albert Wolsky.
Score by Ramin Djawadi and Heitor Pereira seemingly takes its cue from Django Reinhardt in the successful pursuit of its flavorsome, offbeat moods.

It's difficult to resist a project as wildly unfashionable as Robert Towne 's Ask the Dust particularly since the man who wrote Chinatown  and Shampoo  has been plotting his labor-of-love adaptation of the 1939 novel by John Fante  for three decades. Difficult, even painful: but, alas, not impossible. Fante (190983) is a writer of no small interest to students of Los Angeles literary regionalism. Charles Bukowski  considered him his "god," and indeed, Towne helped jump-start the Fante revival, having discovered (and optioned) Ask the Dust  while researching Chinatown . Mentored by H.L. Mencken  and burdened by his own ethnic baggage, Fante infused his early writings with a fierce sense of social inferiority; his self-disgust was only enhanced by his subsequent Hollywood  career. (In addition to Orson Welles 's unfinished It's All True , Fante's credits include Jeanne Eagels   and Walk on the Wild Side. )
Ambitious pulp, taking its title and something of its plot from Norwegian Nobel laureate Knut Hamsun 's Pan , Ask the Dust  is a quasi-autobiographical bildungsroman. Fante's surrogate, the young and virginal would-be writer Arturo Bandini , arrives in California from Colorado having published a single story in, as the movie makes clear, Mencken's American Mercury . Installed in a shabby rooming house and hungry for experience, Bandini finds it in the course of a miserable erotic fixation with the illiterate, sexually provocative waitress Camilla Lopez . (Theirs is a memorably disagreeable meet-cute: He insults her worn huaraches, she wishes him heart failure, he dumps a half-cup of coffee on her table.)
Fueled by shame and prejudice, the doomed relationship of these two proud self-haters is more drunken knife fight than transcendent love affair. The derelict feel is heightened by the back-alley milieu. Ask the Dust is set in the colorful Depression-era demimonde of Los Angeles's since demolished Bunker Hill . (The elaborate, part-CGI set, complete with Angel's Flight funicular railway, is a Pyrrhic victorythis triumph of design adds to the stilted, airless feel.) Albeit emphasizing the period's pervasive anti-Mexican prejudice, Towne must contend with the problem of Fante's vividly unlikable characters. His solution is a good scrubbing and relocation to some disinfected Holiday Inn  of the mind. Ultimately, Ask the Dust  has been less adapted than gentrified; a saga of masochistic torment transformed into a sentimental love story. According to the press notes, Towne's hopeful sell line is " Wuthering Heights  in Bunker Hill."
Alternately grandiose and abject, Bandini is a sort of underground man, and if no more miscast than usual, heartthrob Colin Farrell  miserably fails to convincingly render Bandini's neurosis. Introduced to the viewer tit first, Salma Hayek  makes the volatile Camilla work up to a point. (Having donated her services to this worthy project, she's not about to pull the savagely deglamorizing stunt Penelope Cruz  used to power the tawdry Don't Move .) Donald Sutherland  periodically pops into Farrell's room as the garrulous drunk who lives down the hall. His aren't the only scenes that play as though they were written out of a bottle. In a concession to popular taste, Towne supplies a romantic idyll that barely exists in the novel, complete with puppy and Camilla coughing up blood.
Ask the Dust  means to be all about writing and it is, if not in the way Towne intended. Even the voice of Mencken is heard (courtesy of insider critic Richard Schickel ). Among the mossy morals that might be derived from Ask the Dust  is the Wildean truism that each man kills the thing he loves. Towne not only dramatizes the point but demonstrates it.
