 Terrorism and antiterrorism are growth industries in politics, in culture and in the streets. The dispatches from Iraq and elsewhere detailing the latest suicide bombings are now steadily matched by an outpouring of fiction and nonfiction books and films on terrorism, much of which seems designed to freak the rest of us out, either for the sake of information or entertainment. Everybody wants a piece of the action. Five years ago the French novelist Michel Houellebecq capped his novel "Platform" with a terrorist attack; next week John Updike, who has little use for Mr. Houellebecq, will publish "Terrorist," about a would-be suicide bomber from New Jersey.  Nonfiction, of course, is particularly rich terrain for the new terrorist-studies industry, with books like "Terror in the Name of God: Why Religious Militants Kill," "Dying to Win: The Strategic Logic of Suicide Terrorism" and "The Road to Martyrs' Square: A Journey Into the World of the Suicide Bomber." Conveniently, those with neither the time nor the inclination to thumb through hundreds of pages of text can turn to an easier-to-digest précis like "The Cult of the Suicide Bomber," an engrossing if intellectually thin documentary that purports to explain how suicide bombing — which its narrator, Robert Baer, likens to a "pathological virus" — evolved from a weapon of war into a weapon of terror and, finally in Iraq, a "weapon of chaos."  "The Cult of the Suicide Bomber" was made for Channel 4 in Britain, where it was broadcast in August 2005. Mr. Baer, a former operative for the Central Intelligence Agency and the inspiration for the character played by George Clooney in "Syriana," serves as the film's on- and off-camera center of gravitas, fluidly switching from English to Arabic and Persian; its directors are David Batty and Kevin Toolis. Mr. Baer wrote the film along with Mr. Toolis, who has contributed scores of articles to various British publications. In 2004 he wrote in The New Statesman: "In our baffling, violent world, the terrorism expert, discreetly hinting at access to cryptic intelligence material, is the high priest, able to discern within the entrails of atrocity a fingerprint and a culprit."  The high priests of "The Cult of the Suicide Bomber" begin their story in modern Iran, with a cleric speaking before hundreds of male worshippers who are enthusiastically repeating his calls for "death to America." From there we jump to the seventh century and Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad, whose martyrdom was strategically adopted by Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980's. Faced with Saddam Hussein's superior military strength, Iran "turned martyrdom into a state religion," Mr. Baer says, using children and the young for suicide missions. This war, he contends, employing the film's unfortunate Guinness records-style taxonomy, created the first suicide bomber. Sometime later Mr. Baer also introduces us to what he calls the first suicide car bomber and the first female suicide bomber.  Like so many political films of this type made for British television, this documentary contains more information than analysis, not to mention predictably spooky music. Despite its title, this is not a film about the cult of suicide bombings in general; rather, it is about a specific cult that has developed in the Middle East over the last few decades.  There is no mention of the Assassins, radical Shiite Muslims, who, in Persia and Syria in the 11th and 12th centuries, committed murder and ritual suicide in the name of faith; no inquiry into Japanese kamikaze pilots. More to the contemporary point, both the Tamil Tigers and Chechen terrorists, including the self-detonating black widows in Russia, are mentioned only in passing.  Despite Mr. Toolis's active editorializing in the British press (he has called President Bush a warmonger, among other names), the filmmakers do their best to appear neutral. That said, Mr. Baer does, somewhat provocatively, say of one Hezbollah bomber who drove a car onto an Israeli military base in 1982, "If he had dropped a bomb from a plane on the Israeli military headquarters, would we think of him any differently?" The filmmakers don't answer this question, maybe because they can't. The weight of all the historical and political analysis in the world may simply not be enough to explain the smiles and pacific mien of the men and women who appear in those pre-mission suicide videotapes with which we have all become so lamentably familiar.  Consider, in this respect, an article by Nasra Hassan, published in The New Yorker in November 2001, in which a member of Hamas who had tried and failed to blow up a bus filled with Israeli passengers described what he had felt before undertaking his mission. "We were in a constant state of worship," said the would-be martyr. "We told each other that if the Israelis only knew how joyful we were, they would whip us to death! Those were the happiest days of my life.

Robert Baer, the ex-CIA operative upon whom George Clooney's "Syriana" character was fashioned, is the narrator and central figure in "The Cult of the Suicide Bomber," a docu that aims to explain the tactic, as practiced in the Middle East. Benefiting from a remarkable array of interviewees, this thoughtful, incisive, controversial docu, which already aired on Australian TV, bowed June 2 at Gotham's Cinema Village.
One of the few agents based in Lebanon to escape the 1983 attack by a suicide bomber on the American Embassy, Baer took it as his mission to find out who was responsible and why. He traces the origins of such bombings to Iran, to a 13-year-old soldier who sacrificed himself to blow up a tank. Baer subsequently points to the Ayatollah Khomeini as the man who provided the idea for the cult. By reimagining the Iran-Iraq War as a re-enactment of an ancient religious massacre that consecrated its Shiite victims as holy martyrs headed to paradise, Khomeini gave soldiers a reason to go into battle welcoming death.
Baer travels to Lebanon, where suicide bombing was practiced by members of Hezbollah on invading Israeli troops. The case is made that the huge disparity of firepower between the invading Israelis and the Lebanese army, and the large number of casualties among Lebanese civilians made suicide bombing one of the few effective logistical weapons available.
Baer argues that these were not terrorists, but ordinary soldiers, and wonders whether we would judge them differently if they had dropped bombs on the Israelis from the sky rather than blowing them up on the ground.
He observes that the event that launched suicide bombings inside Israel was perpetrated not by a Palestinian but by an Israeli settler who in 1994 opened fire in a Hebron mosque, killing 29 worshippers and injuring more than 100.
He singles out Palestinian Yahya Ayyash, mastermind of suicide bombings of Israeli buses, as the man responsible for changing this weapon of war into a weapon of terror. Present-day footage in the Occupied Territories of parades featuring children festooned with fake sticks of dynamite, and omnipresent posters of youthful martyrs testify to the widespread belief that suicide is the only heroic act of resistance left.
Baer pinpoints the 2005 London bombings, carried out by a homegrown group, as the birth of a new brand of terror dependent on no particular cadre, training or cause.
Baer fearlessly strides through bombing hot spots across the globe, venturing confidently into Iranian anti-American rallies, Hamas-controlled neighborhoods or Hezbollah headquarters, as archival footage of past devastation in each location counterpoints current tensions. As he sips coffee with a member of the Israeli Special Forces or sits down on a couch with a Muslim martyr's mother, he never evades a question or dodges a controversy.
Pic's theorizing is likely to inspire dissent from both left and right. Baer's views on the Occupied Territories are unlikely to please hardline supporters of Israel, and his vision of Iran as a breeding ground for terrorists could be perceived as warmongering at a time when President Bush seems poised for attack.
Production values are those of a superior TV news special.

Among the Bush era's political docs, something called The Cult of the Suicide Bomber  might seem a media redundancyhaven't we heard enough? No, as it turns outDavid Batty  and Kevin Toolis 's rough-hewn film, made for British TV, matter-of-factly enters the mosques, homes, shrine rooms, personal spaces, and neighborhoods of Muslim martyrs, probing the suicide bomber paradigm as it grew out of the Iranian Revolution and became a global phenomenon. The remarkable primary instrument in use is Robert Baer , the exCIA opcum- author personified by George Clooney  in Syriana . Calm, reasonable, and obviously intimate with Mideast life (no translators are necessary), Baer qualifies as the film's third auteur: He narrates, controls the investigations, gains access to scores of places and interviews we've been led to believe were off-limits to Westerners, and interviews the families of the dead, Hezbollah  members, Israeli secret service generals, even imprisoned Hamas  soldiers.
Throughout, a precise history is offered mostly from the perspective of Arabs, and the issue of martyrdom as an ideological movement is both scanned thoroughly and illustrated mercilessly with footage often culled from the terrorist organizations themselves. This is not the can't-we-get-along Arab-Persian world we see in most liberal nonfiction films, but a broader and helplessly apocalyptic view of an entire region crazed with anger, frustration, and bloodlust into objectifying death as a weapon, a cause for cosmic glory, and little else. (Martyrdom is a desirable choice even among the secular Syrian Socialist National Party , which Baer cannot fathom.) Forgive the 60 Minutes  style cutaways to Baer, and the experience of Muslim life knotted by destructionnot a TV pundits' opinions of suchcan be eye-opening. Perhaps only someone with Baer's experience and gravitational field could strike the film's refreshing political balance, appalled by the violence but never ignorant of its origins in U.S.-sponsored oppression.
Ignorance is not rare, however. On a strictly experiential level, Deborah Scranton 's The War Tapes  is remarkable, tactile, and affecting; as a piece of sociopolitical culture with context and ramifications of its own, it's a worthless ration of war propagandaethnocentric, redneck, and enabling. A journalist given clearance for embedment with the New Hampshire National Guard , Scranton  instead handed out video cameras to a handful of guardsmen, and her film is an edit of that footageplus predictable interviews with their families at home, worrying and bucking up. In fact, for all of the firsthand, edge-of-battle immediacy, the upshot of Scranton's assemblage is concern for the feelings of tremendously sympathetic American grunts as they bulldoze through the Arab landscape and disdainfully observe the indigenous populace from a distance as if they were hyenas on the veld. It's no surprise that the soldiers are largely prone to mercenary self-regard and care only about getting home, not about where they've been, what they've done, or why. But what about us? The cinematic equivalent to a ribbon magnet, The War Tapes  reaps festival awards while less tunnel-visioned docs (like Laura Poitras 's My Country, My Country ) go undistributed. So much for dissenting media channels.
