I will put this to you and dare you to deny it upon pain of death: A man has not fully lived, comedically speaking, until his ears and eyes have been blessed with the experience of octogenarian Jerry Stiller as Doc, the crustily libidinous father of Ben Stiller's 40-year-old nonvirgin bachelor, Eddie Cantrow (aka the Heartbreak Kid), who poses that most paramount of posers, "Been crushin' any pussy lately?" Eddie's answer in the negative clearly chaps his pop's shmekl
; when next we spy Doc, he's schvitzin'
 his way to the promised land via a Vegas hot tub overflowing with both booze and an ultravixenesque vision of feminine pulchritude that'd render even Russ Meyer momentarily insensate. Clearly, Doc is a crusher of the old school, and, someday, some smart director is going to make his
 story, but this is not that. This is, instead, a smart and winning remake of a 1972 Neil Simon-penned Elaine May film. Here, at the wedding of his former fianc�e, Eddie meets and falls madly in love with Lila (Akerman), an appealingly giddy blonde whose witty banter and overt carnality bode very well indeed for his near-future "crushin'" prospects. Before long, they're hitched and honeymooning in Cabo, where, to his dawning dismay, Eddie discovers why, in the long run, Match.com
 may not be such a bad idea after all. Lila sings along, boisterously and well, with every single song that comes on the radio, her marathon sex drive could have qualified her for a spot in the 1938 Munich Olympics (but leaves him a quivering wreck), and suddenly what seemed like a match made in heaven becomes, in the space of days, a hellish mistake. And so, when Lila gets laid up in the honeymoon suite with a severe case of sunburn, Eddie wanders down to the beach and offhandedly makes the acquaintance of another seaside guest, the sweetly self-effacing Miranda (Monaghan), there with her extended "redneck" family. Eddie recognizes a kindred spirit, of sorts, and suddenly it's love at first Jose Cuervo. But what to do about the sun-blown sex bomb upstairs? The Farrelly brothers have always leavened their gross-out strain of humor with a genuine affection for humanity's romantic foibles, and they restrain their more prurient inclinations even further here. This is a Farrelly film for adults, if not the entire family, and it's a charmer, honest both to the nature of the loves we choose in haste and the fear that makes us so hasty so often. The younger Stiller varies his hapless Jew schtick just enough to make Eddie a wholly believable (and ultimately sympathetic, if inadvertent) heartbreaker, and the entire production is marked by stellar comic performances. If it lacks some of the fiercely anarchic tang of early Farrelly outings (such as the criminally underrated Kingpin
), that's not such a bad thing. They've been crushing pussies, so to speak, for long enough, frankly, and it's a pleasure to have them breaking hearts for once.


In 1972's "The Heartbreak Kid," Charles Grodin played a New York Jew who dumps his wife on their Miami Beach honeymoon so he can pursue the blond Minnesota coed he meets at their resort. The movie, directed by Elaine May from Neil Simon's adaptation of a Bruce Jay Friedman short story, is unpolished, oddly broad, and not always believable. And yet it still has a quiet, scathing power about Jewish self-loathing. The Grodin character is a selfish boor who really does break his new wife's heart.
This much louder, more vulgar version of the movie from Bobby and Peter Farrelly has Ben Stiller in the Grodin role, and it starts off asking a much different question. Does a single 40-year-old man yearn for marriage the way some women do? Eddie lives in San Francisco, hangs out with his horndog father (Jerry Stiller) and his best friend (Rob Corddry), for whom marriage is a kind of indentured servitude. Eddie's loneliness is a source of comic humiliation. At the wedding of an ex, he gets seated at the singles table, and he's the only person over the age of 15.
Eventually Eddie meets a tall blonde named Lila (Malin Akerman) outside a laundromat (her purse has just been snatched), and they fall in love. Soon a glitch arrives: Her environmental-research job requires a move to Rotterdam. But her company doesn't force married couples to go. So after six weeks together, Eddie decides to marry her. The Farrellys, who share screenwriting credit with Leslie Dixon, Scot Armstrong, and Kevin Barnett, show Eddie really weighing the decision (his father and his buddy bean him with their opinions). So it makes sense when he agrees to become a husband - it's a rare chance at happiness. But not long after these two drive down to Cabo San Lucas, the movie stops being an exploration of a bachelor's soul and, for better and worse, starts becoming a Farrelly brothers movie.
Better because the brothers have an uncanny gift for locating the comedy in obscenity and making it lovable. Eddie and Lila don't consummate their marriage until the honeymoon, and their ribald maiden tryst is like a Skinemax farce: She's the very kinky girl Rick James got excited about. But the script mutates Lila from a sexual adventuress and cutely annoying free spirit who sings along with the Spice Girls on a road trip into a dim nutbag harboring one shocking revelation after another (she's bad at math, she doesn't understand the missionary position, and so on). Akerman does the best she can with a part that requires her to go from sweet to stark-raving mad. But the movie doesn't have the patience to be fair to Lila - her bikini with the jungle-cat print alone feels like a judgment. The character goes from Cameron Diaz in the Farrellys' magnum opus, "There Something About Mary," to a graduate of the Glenn Close Psycho Academy. The humanity leaks out of her like air from a deflating tire.
This is all to make more appealing the new woman Eddie meets at the beach bar - Michelle Monaghan, who seems a lot happier in a comedy than she does as action-movie damsel. Her name is Miranda, and Eddie falls instantly in love with her. And she and her family - excusing her suspicious cousin, Martin (Danny R. McBride) - fall back. They're in Mexico from Oxford, Miss., and she's as fun as Lila appeared to be, only she's not crazy. By this point, the movie has abandoned its source material and turned needlessly complicated. There's some business with the Mexican guy who works the bar - Carlos Mencia, laying his accent on thick - a mariachi band that doesn't know when to quit, and a stab at some border-crossing satire that's not as amusing or gangbusters as it needs to be. (The Mexicans here are all dirty, drunk, or deceitful.)
The Farrellys turned a corner with their previous movie, "Fever Pitch," which was a great romantic comedy about the compromises of loving someone. They even managed to get a priceless piece of comedic acting from Drew Barrymore, a star whom the directors really seemed to adore. That kind of affection is missing from "The Heartbreak Kid." Then again, so is the human cruelty of Elaine May's original, which has been amplified here for big, stupid laughs. Her movie was about a repugnant man. This remake is ultimately content to be repugnant.


         Like the 1972 Elaine May classic that inspired it, the Farrelly Brothers' remake of "The Heartbreak Kid" is the story of a guy who gets married, regrets it and falls in love with another woman while on his honeymoon. That, more or less, is where the similarities end. But why get bogged down in comparisons, when the new "Heartbreak Kid" stands entirely on its own merits as a grim, shrill, deluded and incredibly depressing movie, so bewilderingly mean-spirited that the trademark Farrelly Brothers gross-out scenes feel like the sweetest.
 
 Perhaps the only reason to compare May's film to the Farrellys' is that a side-by-side comparison seems to sum up the difference between American comedy 30 years ago and what we've come to now. In the original, Charles Grodin plays a self-loathing Jewish guy from New York who ditches his wife on their honeymoon when he meets a Minnesota Valkyrie by the name of Kelly Corcoran (Cybill Shepherd). "Of course a girl like you would have a name like Kelly Corcoran," he tells her, underscoring his shallow jerkiness. In the remake, Ben Stiller plays a non-denominational guy who gets tricked into marrying a model-gorgeous, scrunchy-nosed, nonthreatening do-gooder whose pre-wedding geisha mien inexplicably morphs into a catalog of grotesque gynophobic horrors the moment they leave for the honeymoon -- completely justifying his decision to ditch her for a different model-gorgeous girl he meets while on their honeymoon. See the difference?
 


         






   Sure, in the 1970s, a person (a woman, even!) could make a dark satire about a jerky guy who does the horribly wrong thing, derailing his life and breaking his wife's heart in the pursuit of an illusion. One could even go so far as to suggest that a comeuppance was headed his way for not being careful what he wished for. But focus tests have proved that people hate stuff like themes and moral ambiguity and ambiguous endings, and, clearly, Ben Stiller doesn't want to play the heavy.
 
 Stiller not wanting to play the heavy, though, presents a problem, premise- and story-wise. It removes them. It took five screenwriters to excise all traces of humanity and character-based comedy from the Neil Simon screenplay (based on a short story by the brilliant satirist Bruce Jay Friedman) and replace them with jokes about objects going in or coming out of nostrils. Actually, the jokes about objects going in and coming out of nostrils are limited to three, and they're among the kinder, gentler moments of the movie. What really fills the void are the hate jokes.
 
 Stiller plays Eddie Cantrow, the owner of a San Francisco sporting goods store who, at 40, has never married, much to the dismay of his dad Doc (Jerry Stiller) and his friend Mac (Rob Corddry). Doc and Mac are single-minded in their determination to marry off Eddie. In fact, they talk about nothing else. It's not entirely clear why.
 
 The widowed Doc is contentedly spending his twilight years in Vegas, sharing hot tubs with freak-show breasted biddies. Mac, meanwhile, views marriage like a life sentence in a secret prison not subject to the rules of the Geneva Convention -- which, in his case, is exactly what it is. His hideous harpy of a wife has broken and reprogrammed him. The moment she gets her period, she commands him to go out and get her maxi-pads (yes, maxi-pads, the better to go with the Eisenhower-era joke), as women, you know, always do.
 
 Eddie meets Lila (Malin Akerman, who looks and sounds uncannily like Cameron Diaz) after he tries to save her from a mugger. An angel in fleece jackets, she works as an environmental researcher and oozes sweetness and light from every pore. When Eddie is too chicken to ask for her number, she tracks him down at the store, downplays her intelligence when he frets that her job makes her sound smart, and puts off sex for as long as she can. Six weeks later she tricks him into marrying her, and off to Cabo they go.
 
 It doesn't take long for Eddie to realize that he's made a colossal mistake. The evidence starts piling up from the moment they hit the road. Lila sings along to all the songs on the radio, eats like a pig, has sex like a pro. Somehow, during their six-week Bay Area idyll, Eddie failed to notice that she was dumb, crazy, clingy, boring, broke, slutty and possessed of a terrifyingly unkempt pudendum. Even more horribly, in the time it takes to drive from the Bay Area to Baja, California, she magically transforms from a crunchy, San Francisco bike-rider into a trashy Donatella Versace clone, all leather pants, animal print shirts and piles of gold chains. Where did they come from? Who cares? The important thing is -- poor Eddie! His hot chick is way psycho, just like in that old Onion headline! But one good thing comes out of her shortcomings: They give Eddie license to fall in love with the first other woman he sees.
 
 When Lila suffers a bad sunburn ("Stupid Mexican ozone!") and locks herself in the room for a few days, Eddie wanders out and meets a laid-back dudette named Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), who is vacationing in Cabo with her family, and almost immediately he decides she's the one. Naturally, neither Miranda nor her family know about Lila, wherein lies Eddie's predicament. While they frolic in "the real Mexico," Lila languishes in the hotel room, pining for Eddie. Carlos Mencia plays a raunchy hotel employee who witnesses the whole thing and helps Eddie out in a pinch, for a price.
 
 Obviously, "The Heartbreak Kid" is a Farrelly Brothers movie; nobody expects a corporate sensitivity training video. But there's something surprising about the undercurrent of hostility and disgust that runs through it. Even at the most innocuous moments, you wonder if you haven't walked into a Neil LaBute movie by mistake. At one point, when Eddie complains about Lila's lack of sense of humor, Doc dismisses his criticism by saying, "Funny is a male gene, you idiot. Haven't you noticed whenever there's a funny girl she's a little bit mannish?"
 
 Well, not really. But now that he mentions it, there is 
something about Miranda -- she walks like a guy, uses "dude" as an exclamation and works as a lacrosse coach, passes for funny -- dude! She's a chill dude in a hot girl's body! The ideal woman is a man.
 

 
 "The Heartbreak Kid." MPAA rating: R for sexual content, crude humor and language. Running time: 1 hour, 56 minutes. In general release.   

 If you haven’t seen “The Heartbreak Kid,” Elaine May’s 1972 adaptation of a short story by Bruce Jay Friedman (with a screenplay by Neil Simon), you’re missing a minor, if somewhat dated, classic, a study in Jewish male sexual anxiety that fits comfortably (which is to say nervously and neurotically) alongside “Portnoy’s Complaint” and the early films of Woody Allen and Paul Mazursky.  If you haven’t seen “The Heartbreak Kid,” Peter and Bobby Farrelly’s new update of that earlier picture, I’m jealous.  Don’t get me wrong. I am not dogmatically opposed to remakes, and I’ve admired much of the Farrelly brothers’ earlier work. At their best — in “Shallow Hal” or “Kingpin,” say — they show a rare ability to mix the nasty and the nice, to combine humor based in the grossness of the body and its functions with a sweet, humanistic spirit.  But that generosity seems to have abandoned them here. Their squeamish, childish fascination with bodily ickiness, when crossed with the iffy sexual politics of the original, yields a comic vision remarkable for its hysterical misogyny. It is not just that their hero, a San Francisco sporting-goods salesman named Eddie Cantrow, has some issues with women. These — narcissism, fear of commitment, a sentimental longing for the greener grass on the other side of the fence — are pretty standard among romantic-comedy bachelors. The problem is that, unlike Ms. May and Mr. Simon, the Farrellys have no interest in examining Eddie’s psychology or his soul.  Maybe that’s because, back in 1972, when Eddie was named Lenny and played by Charles Grodin, he actually had one. As impersonated by Ben Stiller, Eddie has only a collection of familiar, grating behaviors. Mr. Stiller possesses a gift for shifting quickly from discomfort to confrontation, a gift he has been happy to squander as his paychecks have grown. His feints and flinches have lost their spontaneity, and his aggression is without vitality.  Eddie, still single at 40, cutely meets Lila (Malin Akerman), a leggy blonde with a passing resemblance to Cameron Diaz, Mr. Stiller’s co-star in the Farrellys’ “There’s Something About Mary.” Six weeks after meeting, Eddie and Lila are married and on their way to a honeymoon in Mexico, at which point Eddie starts to see aspects of his new wife’s personality that had escaped his notice before. She likes to sing along with the radio. She has a deviated septum. Worst of all, she is uninhibited and adventurous in bed. (“What’s the missionary position?” she asks.) What a nightmare!  The decision to make the story pivot on Lila’s emerging monstrousness, rather than on Eddie’s indecision, is a sign of the film’s fundamental cowardice. Once Lila is badly sunburned and covered with scabs and blisters, and once she has revealed herself to be stupid and dishonest — well, no wonder Eddie falls for Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), who is vacationing in Cabo with some members of her extended family.  Ms. Akerman, for all the humiliation she endures, is a nimble and charming comic actress. Ms. Monaghan may be as well, but she never gets the chance to show it because  her job is to incarnate an ideal of obliging loveliness that rules out having an actual personality. Wives have those, which means they are  scary, dumb sexual freaks like Lila — she doesn’t trim her pubic hair! she thinks “inhabitate” is a word! — or scary, sexless control freaks, like the one who henpecks Eddie’s best pal, Mac.  Here I must digress. Mac is played by Rob Corddry, to whom this paragraph is addressed. Mr. Corddry, you used to be one of the finest fake journalists of your generation, and you’ve thrown that away to be Ben Stiller’s third-string sidekick. What, as it were, is up with that?  Anyway, Eddie pursues his flirtation with Miranda, impeded less by his conscience than by logistical complications and the suspicions of her cousin Martin (Danny R. McBride, who was also the best thing about “Hot Rod”). As matters come to a head, Martin will shove a hot pepper up Eddie’s nose and later whack him with a baseball bat. Go Martin! Also, Eddie will be stung by a jellyfish and urinated on, though not by Martin, who has too much dignity for that.  This punishment is much better than Eddie, whose caddishness is the movie’s authentic and unexamined subject, deserves. And the audience deserves better than easy, lazy jokes about Mexicans, who — get this — speak English with funny accents, play mariachi music and rip off tourists. One of them, a fellow known as Uncle Tito (Carlos Mencia, crawling up from the bottom of the Comedy Central barrel), has a habit of saying shocking things to Eddie, waiting a beat, and then exclaiming, “I was only joking.” In its last, desperate moments, “The Heartbreak Kid” tries something similar, but the punch line comes too late to rescue this lame, long, ugly joke of a movie.  “The Heartbreak Kid” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has a lot of profanity and several displays of extravagant— and, under the circumstances, inexplicable — female sexual enthusiasm.

With their smart, hilarious update of �The Heartbreak Kid� the Farrelly brothers make mincemeat of the (often correct) theory that good movies should never be remade. Cleverly bending the template of the Neil Simon-penned, Elaine May-helmed 1972 original to their patented brand of profane gagdom, the Farrellys fashion a pitch-perfect riff on the consequences that ensue when getting hitched turns into something out of Hitchcock. Uproarious romp, grounded in believable if gleefully implausible human behavior, is a model of comic timing. Pic world preemed to side-splitting response in Deauville. Box office prospects worldwide look heartbreakingly good.
The original film, inspired by a Bruce Jay Friedman story about a man who falls in love with another woman mere days after his own wedding, saw a secular Jewish sporting goods salesman marrying his stereotypically Jewish girlfriend, only to start longing to jettison her for a very Gentile -- and presumably unattainable -- blonde beauty while on his honeymoon.
Changing coasts -- with New Yorkers honeymooning in Florida shifted to San Franciscans honeymooning in Mexico -- helmers make the material their own thanks to screenplay�s bold switch: This time the male protag marries the classy blonde bombshell only to find himself longing for a sporty brunette. Original pic�s subtext about ethnic assimilation and class differences has given way to a sort of vulgarity-with-heart, with pic�s R-rated antics a feast for grown-up eyes and funny bones.
Forty-year-old Eddie (Ben Stiller) endures loving flak from his dad, Doc (Jerry Stiller), about his alleged refusal to get married. Vegas-loving, foul-mouthed Doc (�Been crushing any pussy?�) berates his son for not taking full advantage of his bachelor status to screw his brains out.
Determined to be less coarse than his rambunctious father, (when Eddie tells his dad he�s uncomfortable with constant references to �pussy,� Doc diplomatically offers to discuss �snatch� instead), Eddie is still waiting for the perfect lass.
After Eddie comes to the aid of model-pretty young professional Lila (Malin Akerman) when her purse is snatched a few blocks from the athletic goods emporium he owns on Van Ness Avenue, Eddie is egged on by his dad and his best friend Mac (Rob Corddry) to start dating the unattached looker.
Eddie and Lila tie the knot, mere weeks later. But as they drive to Cabo for their honeymoon, Eddie discovers Lila harbors many idiosyncrasies, none endearing. Lila�s sexual repertoire is a surprise, too, as is a slight structural problem with her nose.
At their idyllic destination, Eddie meets hotel employee �Uncle Tito� (Carlos Mencia), a broad-minded kidder whose commercial acumen is perfectly allied with his understanding of human nature. Eddie has already entertained second, third and fourth thoughts about his stunning bride when she develops a toxic sunburn that confines her to their hotel room.
When Eddie meets fellow guest Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), a breezy jock attending a reunion of her sweetly literal-minded Southern family, their effortless banter convinces him he�s just met the real girl of his dreams.
A comic whirlwind of romantic subterfuge ensues, with Eddie benignly neglecting to tell Miranda or her Mississippi-bred relatives that he�s no longer single. Miranda�s humorless cousin Martin (Danny McBride) occupies the over-my-dead-body slot so indelibly iterated by Eddie Albert as Cybill Shepherd�s no-nonsense WASP dad in the original.
Laughs are literally non-stop as every scene amplifies the obstacles and ups the ante in Eddie�s quest to keep Lila at bay with outlandish fabulations while courting Miranda and endeavoring to charm her family.
Winningly cast thesps give incredibly game, spot-on perfs in the service of explosively funny material; musical score is almost a character unto itself and sun-drenched locations provide perfect visual counterpoint to Eddie�s egregiously slimy juggling act.
A model of intelligent adaptation as well as a free-standing entertainment in its own right, pic sustains a superlative level of comic invention straight through to final frames.
