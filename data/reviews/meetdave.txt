In "Meet Dave," Eddie Murphy doesn't sound like himself. He sounds like Tina Turner accepting all her 1985 Grammys - a post-colonial Caribbean queen. He wears a three-piece suit as white as Ryan Seacrest's teeth, and the skin on his ageless face is milky but tight like the top layer on a cup of pudding. He's either required to stand with his eyes abug or make sudden, robotically stiff gestures. Murphy is supposed to be playing Dave Ming Chang, a spaceship controlled by microscopic humans, but he looks like an escapee from Madame Tussauds.
An hour in a wax museum would provide a slightly better time than this movie, which has Murphy also playing the tiny captain controlling his human-size self from a control deck in the spaceship's head. It's mostly harmless. It's also entirely dumb, as dumb as anyone could hope a movie that ends with a flying wingtip shoe to be. The plot has the captain and his crew in New York City looking for an orb to save their distant planet. It's "WALL-E" for nincompoops, and somehow Elizabeth Banks, Scott Caan, and Caan's radioactive-looking tan get mixed up in it.
Surrounded by a mixed-nuts crew (Judah Friedlander from "30 Rock," Ed Helms from "The Office," and Gabrielle Union from "Tyler Perry's Daddy's Little Girls") Murphy tries to keep the worship-bee comedians from stealing his show. But things on that space bridge seem like "Star Trek: The Public Access Years." If Helms wants to stuff that under his shirt, Murphy should probably let him.
But he can't say no to any of the gags in this movie, not even the one that requires him - as the well-dressed spaceship - to drink a bottle of ketchup or another in which he backs out of a room like Mork might have done to Mindy. The movie has giant toy sets meant to represent the stations in Dave's body. Friedlander, for instance, handles the buttocks, so when money rains from between Dave's legs, it presumably is he who's released the valve.
The director Brian Robbins oversaw Murphy's criminal offenses in last year's "Norbit," and exhibits even less wit here. He's encouraged the actors manning the mouth regions to slip and slosh around, grabbing the big molars like they're on a Universal Studios ride: Honey, I Shrunk My Dignity. The movie has the amateurish earnestness of a school play and the sad overnight construction of certain science projects. The special effects here may as well be done by Mattel
.
There's a tremendous possibility that Murphy has no friends. What kind of pal would let the star of "Pluto Nash" near another science-fiction comedy? It's as if he and Mike Myers are in a race to see whose ingenuity can run more flagrantly aground until the next "Shrek" picture comes along. To be fair to Murphy, "Meet Dave" is no "Love Guru." He's not trying nearly as hard as Myers was, so the movie is scarcely as excruciating. On just about every occasion in "Meet Dave," Murphy appears to be on the verge of cracking himself up. This is good news. At least someone found him funny.


 In “Meet Dave,” the latest in a long line of disposable Eddie Murphy vehicles, the star talks funny, walks funny and enters a bathroom stall for some rather less humorous noisy business. In yet another potty scene (this movie knows its target audience), he stands with his legs apart as dollar bills float and coins (ouch) tumble from his posterior, excreting money like a slot machine that’s racked up three 7’s.  He poops  money for laughs, though of course what he’s really doing is pooping laughs for money. Talk about filthy lucre.  Mr. Murphy, alas, has been engaged in much the same dirty business for too much of his career. “Meet Dave,” which is about some itty-bitty aliens who land on Earth (the real and a back-lot New York City)  for some reason or other, is by no means the worst of his projects. Directed by Brian Robbins, from a script by Rob Greenberg and Bill Corbett, the movie is clichéd but innocuous, one grating, swishy stereotype aside. The director and writers have all toiled in television’s laugh factory (Mr. Corbett is an alumnus of “Mystery Science Theater 3000”), and the movie plays like a half-hour sitcom episode that has been stretched — principally through Mr. Murphy’s walking and talking — to  feature-length running time.  That some of this walking and talking is amusingly daft is to be expected. The movie’s opening, which finds one of the two characters Mr. Murphy plays newly landed on Earth and face down in dirt, features him executing a herky-jerky silly walk — at one point forming a series of cubistic right angles — that brings to mind the prime of Jerry Lewis and Steve Martin alike. This is a performer who, from his snapping, rubber-band mouth to his fancy-dancing toes, wrings comedy (and sometimes a little menace) from every twitch and tremble. I could watch Mr. Murphy go herky-jerky for 90 minutes, but these bits of pure comedy have been predictably folded into  the usual filler: a cute kid, a love interest, some plot.  There is not much else to report, other than the giant tongue that unrolls like a red carpet, the shoe that puts the wing in wingtip and the likable Elizabeth Banks, who holds her ground against Mr. Murphy as an open-minded New Yorker. Of minor note is that Mr. Murphy’s penchant for playing more than one character, which until recently  suggested an impatience with the limitations of most of his roles, has started to feel like a hedge against boredom. Though mildly amusing, his two characters in “Meet Dave” — a wee captain and a humanoid  spaceship — neither tax nor stretch him. When the captain instructs the spaceship to walk and talk among the earthlings, it does so perfectly, the very picture of a well-oiled comedy machine.  “Meet Dave” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Potty humor, intimations of violence.

Cynics may expect the worst of another Eddie Murphy vehicle involving extraterrestrials -- insert joke about "The Adventures of Pluto Nash" here -- but that only makes "Meet Dave" all the more pleasant a surprise. Aimed at the same family audiences that flocked to Murphy's "Doctor Dolittle" comedies, this lightly amusing and sweet Fox release should score midrange summer B.O. numbers, despite competition from other kidpics in theatrical circulation, and later enjoy a long shelf life as homevid fare.
Dave Ming Chang (Murphy) is a man who falls to Earth and winds up wandering the streets of Manhattan. Decked out in a disco-era white suit, and proceeding with the stiff, sudden movements of a disoriented stork, Dave appears to be the epitome of a fish out of water. But that's only because he really isn't a man at all.
Rather, Dave is a spacecraft, meticulously constructed in the image of its tiny Captain (also Murphy), and filled with an entire crew of similarly miniscule space invaders. These strange visitors from the planet Nil arrive with spotty and largely outdated ideas about Earth language and customs. (The white suit? Blame it on the only TV rerun ever to reach Nil.) They're confused and intrigued by the oddities they encounter -- why, for example, do Earthlings amass vast repositories of vital information, then give these invaluable resources such silly names as Google and Yahoo?
But the Captain and his loyal No. 3 (Gabrielle Union, radiant as always) must do a little Googling of their own to complete their mission: finding a missing baseball-sized device that will do something good for their home planet and something very bad to the oceans on Earth. The hunt leads Dave to Gina (Elizabeth Banks), a pretty single mom, and her young son, Josh (Austyn Lind Myers), a bullied grade-schooler in need of a father figure.
�Meet Dave� works best when helmer Brian Robbins, working from a clever script by Rob Greenberg and Bill Corbett, uses the f/x trickery relatively sparingly, and allows Murphy to shine as the pic�s most special effect. His gracefully awkward body language in Dave's early scenes recalls Steve Martin's herky-jerky hilarity as the spiritually possessed lawyer in "All of Me."
But even after the man-shaped spaceship adapts to ambulating, Murphy remains amusing as Dave does his best to mimic the expressions and understand the language of Earthlings.
Murphy works in a lower key, but to good effect, as the Captain, a vaguely Brit-accented commander who's too busy to notice No. 3's romantic overtures. Love blooms only after they and other Nillians aboard Spaceship Dave are "infected" by the emotional and psychological characteristics of Earthlings. (As a security officer who gets in touch with his inner queen, Pat Kilbane takes the sting out of a swishy caricature through sheer force of uproarious overplaying.)
"Meet Dave" hits a speed bump in the third act when a humorless No. 2 (Ed Helms) wrestles command away from the Captain, leading to a sequence that involves bright lights, loud explosions and f/x flash. It seems entirely out of keeping with the rest of the pic, but fortunately, it doesn't last long.
Production values are first-rate. But "Meet Dave" demonstrates the benefits of emphasizing a human touch over hardware when it comes to funny business.
