Married Life  takes place in an imagined 1949 America. Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day  is set in a fairy-tale 1939  England. Yet both pictures bear the recognizable time stamp of right now . Don't be fooled by the frothy vision of Amy Adams in draped furs and fetching hats as Miss Pettigrew 's madcap American nightclub singer and aspiring actress, or by the sleek, platinum blond grace of Rachel McAdams as a thoughtful widow in love with another woman's husband in Married Life . These re-created epochal settings, with lavish attention paid to the serving of tea cakes, mask  thoroughly modern, approving attitudes of feminine autonomy and sexual equality, both  by the writers and directors as well as the frisky actors happy to play ''historical.''
And by actors I mean, specifically, actresses. McAdams and Adams are dewy, vibrant stars whose popularity lies in the feminist independence they generously grant to the fictional women they play. How we love the trappings of other periods  provided we can tinker with the period attitudes to suit our current fashions!  Both these slight, wistful movies  evanescent diversions with a combined weight of less than a magnum of champagne  play at matters of financial, professional, marital, and erotic dilemma with all the seriousness of an after-dinner game of charades. Mostly, they each put on a pretty show.
Of the two, Married Life  has more on its mind, manifest in the arch elegance of the plot, a looped chain of infidelities and loyalties meant to comment on the mysteries of marital bonds. (Ira Sachs, who made the outstanding 2005 indie  Forty Shades of Blue , directed, and co-wrote the script with Oren Moverman.) Playing Kay, widowed by WWII and living in an unnamed suburb, McAdams is a particularly delightful vision after her two-year intermission from the screen following The Family Stone . So it's no  stretch to see how a romantic, lonely married  man like Harry Allen (Chris Cooper, wonderfully subtle), missing enough emotional intimacy with his wife, Pat (Patricia Clarkson, Cooper's perfect match), could fall in love with Kay's compassion  or, indeed, how Kay's heart would open to a gentle man who needs her so sincerely. (Pierce Brosnan complicates the plot as Harry's lothario of a single friend, Richard, who also sets his sights on Kay.) In fact, Married Life  is much more about  the enduring relationship between husband and  wife than it is about the excitement between  husband and girlfriend. So sure is Harry that  divorce would devastate Pat that he resolves, out of love, to kill her himself. Married Life  congratulates its audience on a sophisticated, humorous complicity in the obvious immorality of Harry's murder plans, as well as in Richard's own ungentlemanly  designs on his pal's gorgeous girl. Every adult, the movie suggests, has got a secret.
Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day , in contrast, thinks secrets are quite naughty, in a nursery way. But they're also kind of cute, in a British tweedle-dee-dee way. We're meant to cheer when Frances McDormand, as the title middle-aged, prim British miss, desperate for a job, lies  her way into the employ of Delysia Lafosse  (Adams). It's a wonder Miss P isn't carrying  Mary Poppins' tool kit, so useful does she turn out to be for Delysia, who's got two caddish, bedable beaus and one genuine, jazz-piano-playing nobody who honestly loves her (Lee Pace from Pushing Daisies ). Adams, of course, is a peach.  Her sparkle requires only minor character  adjustment and twinkle recharging from her  recent triumph as the old-fashioned modern  heroine in Enchanted .
Delysia's perils and pleasures don't amount to a hill of beans (the movie, based on a forward-thinking 1938 novel by Winifred Watson, is directed by Britain-based Bharat Nalluri). Neither do those of Miss P, who happens to enchant an attractive, mature, successful widower (Ciarán Hinds) of her own in the course of a day's work. Then again, Miss Pettigrew , and  Married Life , for that matter, aren't about the real pleasures and perils of not-too-distant past eras; they're about pleasurable, flattering role choices for popular actresses and their admirers  and about nifty, fun-to-wear vintage costumes, too. Married Life : B ; Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day :

 “Married Life,” a period comedy of manners merged with a suspenseful psychological thriller, aspires to be a hybrid of the sort that Alfred Hitchcock polished to perfection in the age of sexual subtext and subterfuge.  When to shudder and when to smirk: as you watch this sly marital fable of secrets, lies and homicidal intent, you’re never sure of what your reaction should be. Up to a point, the director, Ira Sachs (“Forty Shades of Blue”), who wrote the screenplay with Oren Moverman, clearly wants it that way.  Adapted from John Bingham’s book “Five Roundabouts to Heaven,” the movie, set in 1949, stars Chris Cooper and Patricia Clarkson as Harry and Pat Allen, a couple whose cozy marriage is suddenly endangered when Harry falls head over heels for Kay Nesbitt (Rachel McAdams), a beautiful, much younger war widow who returns his passion.  But Harry has convinced himself that his wife is so in love with him that she would be destroyed if he divorced her. To spare her the pain of abandonment, he decides that the most humane solution is to kill her. This is the sort of gallows humor that Hitchcock relished drawing out in cruelly amusing cat-and-mouse games, not to be taken too seriously. The same is true of “Married Life.” The murder plot is not to be taken any more literally than the lethal games of “Mr. and Mrs. Smith.”  The story is narrated by Harry’s best friend, Richard Langley (Pierce Brosnan), a suave lothario whose mouth begins to water the moment Harry introduces him to Kay. Harry foolishly insists that Richard visit his new lady love in Harry’s rustic country house to cheer her up while he is stuck in the city (presumably New York) or away on a business trip.  Mr. Brosnan is perfectly cast as a silver-tongued predator eyeing an irresistible morsel. Sixty years ago Ray Milland or James Mason (shown here in a love scene with Ava Gardner from “Pandora and the Flying Dutchman”) would have imbued him with the same serpentine charm.  Ms. McAdams’s Kay looks every inch the classic Hitchcock bottle blonde: a cherry-lipped, platinum-haired beauty cut from the Tippi Hedren-Kim Novak mold, who turns heads when she enters a room. But beyond a cheery vivacity, Ms. McAdams breathes no inner life into this luscious dish. Nor is there any chemistry between Ms. McAdams and Mr. Cooper, who looks almost old enough to be her grandfather.  Harry is a sharp deviation from Mr. Cooper’s brooding, granite-faced stoics. For all the layers he reveals of Harry, his performance feels like a slightly uncomfortable mismatch of actor and role. He is too much a man’s man to play a bumbling fool for love.  Ms. Clarkson’s Pat is a fascinating chameleon whose ability to feign a blind adoration that fools Harry into imagining that she can’t live without him is almost believable. She also shows the other side of Pat, a smoldering sensualist who believes that people marry for sex, not lovey-dovey companionship. With her throaty voice, which ripples with insinuation, and flashing glances,  which hint at treachery, she is as intriguingly enigmatic in “Married Life” as she was in “The Dying Gaul” and “Far From Heaven.”  In fact, “Married Life” could almost be taken as a prequel to “Far From Heaven,” Todd Haynes’s politically pointed deconstruction of a Douglas Sirk melodrama. But with Hitchcock replacing Sirk as muse, teasing comic mystery substitutes for sudsy melodrama. Beyond examining the age-old battle of the sexes within the confines of a long-term relationship, the movie is apolitical.  “Married Life” is as studious in its re-creation of late-’40s ambiance and décor as “Far From Heaven” was in its evocation of Eisenhower-era suburbia. A comparison of the two films suggests how rapidly American affluence advanced in half a decade, from shabby postwar gentility toward a sleek modernity. Together, the two movies and the television series “Mad Men,” set in 1960, can be looked at as a historical trilogy examining changing American design over a decade.  “Married Life” does not provide the shivery security of being manipulated by Hitchcock, a master trickster who calculated his every move. The sense of being guided through a story by a sure-handed Hollywood magician toward a delightful trick ending is missing. That insecurity, of course, is what makes “Married Life” contemporary. You can never really go back.  “Married Life” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some thematic elements and a scene of sexuality.

The tone, casting and material form a less-than-perfect match in "Married Life," a period domestic drama that never quite decides if it wants to be a credible marital study, a noirish meller or a sly comedy. The talented quartet of lead players feel oddly paired in this curious tale of jealousy, betrayal and murderous intent. Helmer Ira Sachs, whose last picture, "Forty Shades of Blue," won the top jury prize at Sundance two years ago, appears to be working a bit out of his zone here. Combo of likely restrained critical response and mature-leaning cast and content points to restrained theatrical B.O. prospects.
The snappy animated credits suggest a fizzy mood immediately contradicted by the opening scene. It's Nov. 5, 1949, and in a stylish and smoky eatery in what is presumably New York City, aging gent Harry (Chris Cooper) confides to his best friend Richard (Pierce Brosnan) that he's leaving his wife for someone new, who's given him a shot at true happiness.
Harry seems almost childishly sincere about his emotional reawakening, but is downright naive about the consequences of introducing his roguish bachelor buddy to his sweetheart Kay (Rachel McAdams), a demure bottle-blonde beauty who, one surmises, fell for the three-decades-older Harry due to a need for a reliable male authority figure after the deaths of her father and soldier husband; one look at her and it's clear Richard is going to have a very hard time keeping his hands off his pal's girl.
Based on an obscure pulp novel, John Bingham's "Five Roundabouts to Heaven," the yarn heads directly into noir territory when Harry plots to murder his devoted longtime wife Pat (Patricia Clarkson) to spare her the pain of divorce. As Harry is unaccustomed to such wayward undertakings, this takes a while, by which time Richard and Kay have found a way to heat up the cold winter. Pat also has some private business going on that no one, least of all her husband, knows about, creating layers of duplicity all around.
Most of "Married Life" consists of lengthy dialogue scenes. Possibly because many of these conversations involve confidential information, the thesps have been directed to speak in a muted, hushed manner, as well as with a pause-ridden cadence that invests the delivery with a stilted, artificial character.
Add to this the characters wearing heavy woolen clothes in overly warm rooms, and feverish emotions cloaked by societal reticence, and it's easy to see the hothouse atmosphere Sachs is shooting for. Unfortunately, the result is not so much overheated as suffocatingly claustrophobic, with a set of characters who follow their desires but try to disguise the fact from others. Pic is dramatic but lacks a dynamic; one can sense the director's intent and affection for the form, but also see that working in this stylized vein does not necessarily come easily for a filmmaker of his hitherto more naturalistic tendencies.
Additional unease stems from the vast age difference between McAdams' Kay and both of her suitors. Even if plausible psychological reasons can be offered for her choices, the physical matchups don't feel right, suggesting either that Kay should have been played by someone a bit older or Harry, especially, by a younger actor (strangely, Cooper comes off as at least a decade younger in the imminent "The Kingdom" than he does here).
Regrettably absent from the bigscreen since "The Family Stone" nearly two years ago, McAdams endows her readings with tender feeling, but her natural vivaciousness and spontaneity are straightjacketed by the format. Not only that, but she looks much better with her natural hair color than as a phony blonde.
Cooper counterbalances Harry's misguided foolishness with the strong suggestion of a dignified man's awareness that this likely represents his final hope for a rejuvenating romance. Although Richard's professional life and background could have used a line or two of definition, Brosnan has little trouble convincing as a selfish cad, and Clarkson has fun withholding, then revealing the true nature of her would-be victim.
Shot in Canada, the pic makes do from a period p.o.v. with a very limited number of sets and costumes.

Do we need another look back at the rotten heart of the '50s nuclear family? Ira Sachs  thinks we do, and as one who can't get enough of sweaty melodramas about rotting families, I'm with him in principle. Mind you, Sachs's noticeably childless new movie is less about families than about cheating couples—you know, as in John Updike , plus guilt. And though 1940s film noir and the maternal melodrama cast a long shadow over Married Life , the movie rarely breaks a sweat. Slow, deliberate, and russet to a fault, this quietly controlled chamber piece is based on a 1959 murder mystery by British writer John Bingham , who also doubled as a spy (and, word has it, was the model for John le Carré 's superspy, George Smiley ). If the movie's themes are desire and betrayal, there's more surveillance than carnality in the hushed couplings and decouplings of Harry, Pat, Richard, and Kay, upstanding citizens of a Pacific Northwest  suburb.
We meet Harry (Chris Cooper ), a drably genteel company man whose thin, clamped mouth conceals cumulative misery, confessing to his bachelor friend Richard (Pierce Brosnan ) in a bar that he's found "true happiness" in the arms of another woman, but can't bring himself to divorce his happy-homemaker wife Pat (Patricia Clarkson ) because, he believes, the news would kill her. This news comes as a surprise to the more sexually seasoned Richard, and when Harry's new squeeze Kay (Rachel McAdams ) walks into the bar in a platinum-blond Kim Novak  'do and demurely lowered eyelashes, he resolves to go after her himself. Richard's voice-over takes us through the lying, cheating, dissembling, and adventures in poisoned aspirin that follow, but there's not a reliable narrator in the pack—not even Pat, who has her own little sideline going with a lusty neighbor.
Sachs's previous features, Forty Shades of Blue  and The Delta , which racked up sufficiently good notices to allow him to raid the top drawer of indie talent for Married Life , also dealt with the mysteries of domestic life. But Married Life  is his first real excursion into genre filmmaking, and though it's a perfectly presentable effort, he lacks the passion and the radical vision of the filmmaker to whom he owes his biggest debt. Sachs co-wrote the script for Married Life  with Oren Moverman , who also co-wrote Todd Haynes 's I'm Not There , and though the imprint of Douglas Sirk  is all over Sachs's homage to old movies about restless men in bad suits and untrustworthy women in lovely frocks, his immediate reference point is clearly Haynes's Far From Heaven .
Like Haynes, Sachs means to solicit our sympathy for each one of this hapless crew, who, with one significant exception, aren't so much cynical swingers as earnest suburbanites blinded by self-justification and repressed desire. But where Far From Heaven  continually renews itself by expanding upon and deepening each character's pent-up longings, Married Life  sews them up in neatly attenuated reversals—the sexed-up wifey versus the prim Other Woman, the straight arrow with murder in his heart, the rolling stone who's ready to gather a little moss. Where Far From Heaven 's lush cinematography and production design bespeak a world bursting with deflected desire, Married Life  is diligently period-correct in the manner of television drama. The movie doesn't lack for formal ambition—Sachs is juggling several genres here and, lacking Haynes's technical mastery, is finally undone by them. Where Haynes, in his dissident way, insists on the ineluctably American pursuit of individual happiness, Sachs seems undecided about whether he wants us to giggle at Harry or purse our lips. Where Haynes dared to risk pedagogy by overlaying the 1950s with the questions of race, gender, and class that preoccupy his entire oeuvre, Married Life  ventures no commentary at all.
Maybe there's nothing more to say and American cinema has finally exhausted its ragging on the most maligned decade of the 20th century. Maybe some day soon, imaginative filmmakers will question our smug ruling myths about the miseries and repressed passions of '50s suburbia. Maybe they'll discover that we, with our unisex-less Gap and Banana Republic  uniforms and our sublimation of desire into health and fitness and too much food, live in far more sublimated and sexually terrified times than Harry and Pat and Richard and Kay could ever have dreamed of.
