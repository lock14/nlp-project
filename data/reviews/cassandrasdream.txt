At this point, I guess we should just applaud Allen for his work ethic. Even at the ripe old age of 72, he�s still making movies at the rate of one a year, come rain or come shine. The problem, of course, is that he doesn�t make good
 movies at the rate of one a year. In fact, by my count, he hasn�t made a good movie for almost a decade (1999�s Sweet and Lowdown
), which is fine if you�re Terrence Malick, but it makes lifelong fans of Allen (myself included) wish he�d just give up being prolific, put away his camera, and take up watching the New York Knicks full time. With any luck, his quickly fading legacy can still be salvaged. Cassandra�s Dream
 is the former master�s latest plunge into irrelevance. Like 1989�s brilliant Crimes and Misdemeanors
 and 2005�s considerably less brilliant Match Point
, Dream
 is a meditation on the consequences of immorality, this time the murder of a London man by two affable but down-on-their-luck British brothers, Ian and Terry (McGregor and Farrell). Goaded by a rich uncle (Wilkinson) to do the deed in return for enough money to set both their lives straight, the brothers respond by indulging in lengthy discussions about the nature of evil and weighing the benefits of financial security against the risks (both of legal and spiritual) of cold-blooded murder before finally getting down to the bloody business. McGregor and Farrell do their level best to communicate some of the philosophical ambivalence and moral murkiness that accompany acts of brutality, but they�re up against inertia working with Allen. It�s old news to say the director likes to take a hands-off approach with his actors and avoid rehearsal in the name of a speedy shoot (both the film�s stars have commented on this to the press, with McGregor praising his boss for allowing him to be home by 4:30 every afternoon and �have a life�), but there�s a fine line between �hands-off� and total disengagement, and Allen has tumbled (Buddha-like) right over it. In Cassandra
, his actors look like they�re all seeing the script for the first time and so have no clue what their characters� personalities or motivations are. And the result is like some guest-celebrity scene-reading in a college acting class, with McGregor spouting lines like, �I�m taken aback,� and, �I�m stunned,� with all the conviction of a cuckoo clock and Farrell changing personalities every time he opens his lips to speak. I don�t know if I�ve ever seen actors look so lost. Strange to say, but after 40 years in the business, it seems Allen has forgotten everything he�s learned about making movies.


The unsettling new Woody Allen movie, "Cassandra's Dream," is about two London brothers - Ian (Ewan McGregor) and Terry Blaine (Colin Farrell) - who buy an old sailboat they can barely afford. They fix it up. The boat is an impressive prop in their divergent bid for upward mobility. Ian is trying to unhook himself from managing his father's foundering restaurant in order to try his hand at Los Angeles real estate. He's desperate to achieve grander things. He borrows the Jaguars Terry repairs at an auto shop to impress women. Not 15 minutes into the picture, Ian's traded up a waitress at the restaurant for an expensive-looking young actress named Angela (Hayley Atwell).
Terry is the simpler of the two. There's real dirt under his mechanic's fingernails. He's also a gambler. So is Allen. Eventually, Terry loses tens of thousands playing poker, and the film's innocent class drama turns into a tense little film noir - just like Allen's "Match Point" from a couple of years ago. The difference between these movies is patience, logic, and the richness of the acting. Both are agonizingly suspenseful as the enveloping moral dilemmas curdle into quagmires. But with "Match Point," Allen was as aspirational as his young, lady-killing hero - both of them smitten with the trappings of posh London life. They were one and the same, and the transparency was grim and ugly and smugly heartless.
This new movie is an improved remix. (It even has a Scarlett Johansson upgrade, a very good Sally Hawkins as Terry's loving girlfriend.) It's merely sad in the way it manages to pull Ian and Terry in over their heads. The mood of the picture is just right. Those sawing strings in Philip Glass's score make you feel as if you're drowning in bad news as opposed to bad scoring, the way you're sometimes wont to feel with Glass. Allen's storytelling is crisper here than it has been all decade, even if he's making shadow puppets out of the forewarnings. ("I think it's moral," Angela says about the erotic play she's currently in. "It's about evil." And at a garden party, she and her host talk about the Greek tragedies. Her favorite character is Clytemnestra.)
The movie is actually a softer treatment of the similar sibling anguish in Sidney Lumet's "Before the Devil Knows You're Dead." Allen isn't enough of a great dark artist to pull off a full-scale tragedy the way Lumet does. He and his cinematographer, Vilmos Zsigmond, and regular editor, Alisa Lepselter, cheat during the big grisly moments. You could say the squeamishness makes the movie feel lighter than it probably should (it's easy to imagine this being played for irreverent comedy). But the awfulness still comes across.
And at this point, Allen at least seems to know his limitations. He takes a lot of the pressure off himself as a writer by turning "Cassandra's Dream" into a character study. I guess "Match Point" was a character study, too. But the character was desperately negative. Allen resorted to murder only after writing himself into a jam. This time, he seems truly curious about the human stress of the act itself, much in the way he did with "Crimes and Misdemeanors."
The movie's morality is at intriguing odds with the idea of survival. Desperation really will make people do crazy things. Ian and Terry's father (John Benfield) was neither ambitious enough to dream bigger or desperate enough to take a real risk, and his wife (Clare Higgins) bitterly holds his modest success against him. He should have been more like her brother Howard (Tom Wilkinson), an outrageously flush plastic surgeon who's been giving the family money for years.
The Blaines are caught in a Eugene O'Neill time trap. They're living for an unattainable future. Howard's success is a model for Ian and Terry. But they discover they're not ruthless enough to achieve his wealth and power. Most people aren't. Allen's movie is a disturbing look at two boyish men who are too average, too human, too uninspired, too unlucky to be truly great.
In the process, he gets some lovely, delicate acting out of McGregor and Farrell, both of whom, like Benfield and Higgins, seem to have worked out their characters psychologically. How refreshing to see McGregor playing a lived-in person as opposed to a gimmicky prop or personality. The polish and gleam he gives Ian are a front for the character's delusional insecurity. It's a deceptively intelligent performance.
Farrell is even better. Despite Terry's chain-smoking, pill-popping, drinking, and gambling, he's kind and lovable. Unlike his brother, he actually wants a nice average life with his woman. But he can't resist the thrill of putting everything on the line.
Farrell vanishes inside Terry's boyish pluck and his nervousness. When Terry comes unglued, Farrell sometimes conveys the weight of a philosophical crisis by arching his eyebrows. If this performance is a quiet turning point for Farrell, it's a breakthrough for Allen, too. In his previous movies, Terry would have been the dumb mook with no conscience and no brain. He would have been a joke for a scene or two. Allen suddenly has a lot of feeling for that sort of character. Now he's the movie's soul.

For movie stars, the prospect of being cast in a Woody Allen film has never lost its mystique, its sheen of cultish privilege. It hardly matters if the part is small. To act for Woody is to upgrade your cred, to join the club of the anointed; since Allen can cast more or less anyone he wants, the fact that he chose you  is part of what makes the offer flattering. That said, the luster of appearing in a Woody Allen film  the promise of what it will do for an actor's art or career  may, by now, be more myth than reality. Scarlett Johansson had her plummiest role to date as the depressive temptress of Match Point , and I loved Sean Penn as the quirky jazz troubadour of Sweet and Lowdown , but does anyone even remember Christina Ricci and Jason Biggs in Anything Else ? Tèa Leoni in Hollywood Ending ? Or all those unlucky actors who've had to go through the marionette ritual of mimicking Woody's skip-stutter neurotic speech mannerisms, like Kenneth Branagh in Celebrity , Will Ferrell in Melinda and Melinda , or  yes  Scarlett Johansson in Scoop ? When it comes to casting, Woody giveth and Woody taketh away.
Allen's latest, Cassandra's Dream , is one of his debonair ''small'' entertainments, the closest that he has come to doing a tidy, no-frills, down-and-dirty genre thriller. (Match Point  was a thriller too, but a far more ambitious one.) The most striking thing about it is the casting: Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell as hungry blokes in South London who happen to be brothers, and who team up to commit a murder. What's novel, for Allen, is that both the lead actors are bona fide sex symbols, and the director, in a rare mood of non-anxiety, doesn't shrink from that  he's at home with their laid-back duet of male cool. Maybe it has something to do with their nationalities. Allen must feel that men from England, Ireland, and Scotland have enough natural class to satisfy his pretensions without his having to neuter them into ''intellectuals.''
When we first meet Ian (McGregor) and Terry (Farrell), they're buying a sailboat, which they name Cassandra's Dream   a nice collaboration for two brothers who are close enough to be best friends, except that neither one can really afford the purchase. Ian, a wage slave with a cheerful, airy manner, works at their father's restaurant, devoting himself with old-world duty to the family business. Terry, who is simpler, gruffer  a prole  is a mechanic who lets Ian borrow the sports cars he's in the middle of repairing. The acrid aroma of financial desperation hovers over Cassandra's Dream . Like Match Point , it's a story of how far people will go to thrive in an age when money is status and status is everything.
Driving a Jaguar from Terry's shop, Ian pulls over to assist Angela (Hayley Atwell), whose car has broken down on a country road. Gorgeous and smart, a silky London stage actress, she's like a femme fatale, except there's nothing particularly scheming about her. She's part of a new breed of global consumerist princess who expects her suitors to be rolling in cash and connections. And so Ian, smitten, instinctively remolds his image, pretending to own that Jag, trumping up a shaky Los Angeles investment scheme into the sham image that he's ''in real estate.'' (It's Angela, of course, who's the real commodity.) Terry, meanwhile, is a sweet guy with a gambling fix. It's his debt, incurred during one feverish night of poker, that prods the brothers to ask for financial assistance from their uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson), a wealthy expatriate plastic surgeon who agrees to help them. Under one condition: that they murder the whistle-blower who's about to ruin his career.
So here goes Woody again, doing yet another spin on his Crimes and Misdemeanors  plot: a tale of ordinary people driven to kill. Match Point  wove avarice, duplicity, and fatal attraction into a caper worthy of Tom Ripley, but in Cassandra's Dream , Uncle Howard's cold-sweat homicidal plan drops in, conveniently, out of nowhere. Wilkinson delivers a fulminating speech about the sacred duty of ''family'' as if it had been plucked from a bad Mob movie, and everything that follows has a detached and almost academic flavor. Cassandra's Dream  feels like an exercise: the demonstration of a theme rather than the blood-on-the-carpet embodiment of it. Yet it's never boring, because McGregor and Farrell bring such verve and style and quickened life to their roles. McGregor's Ian grows more sinister as he's seized by his delusion of love, but it's Farrell's Terry, his guilt rotting away his insides, who gives the movie its squirmy bit of soul. This tale of two brothers wrenched apart when they act badly is really a testament to its stars, who in this film act very well, and with visible joy. They make working for Woody Allen into a promise fulfilled.

 “Cassandra’s Dream,”  Woody Allen’s latest excursion to the dark side of human nature, is good enough that you may wonder why he doesn’t just stop making comedies once and for all. Perhaps that’s heretical, but it’s the view of someone who has accompanied Mr. Allen on all his recent follies, “The Curse of the Jade Scorpion” included, and has too often heard her own laughter die gurgling in her throat from a lack of inspiration. There’s nothing remotely funny about “Cassandra’s Dream,” save perhaps that immodest title.  As with his last two films, “Match Point” (black as pitch and very fine) and “Scoop” (an amusing goof), “Cassandra’s Dream” takes place in a movie-made London where the picturesque streets can turn into noirish dead ends. A well-matched Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell play Ian and Terry, brothers in blood and deed. Somewhat flash, with natty suits and a jaunty walk, Ian helps run their father’s struggling restaurant; Terry, in turn, works in a garage where the grease creeps under his nails and stays there. Ian dreams of making it big in real estate, while Terry banks on the dog races and the poker table. They’re good boys, nice guys, eager to please, fast to smile and as dedicated to each other as to the idea of family.  That idea is put to the cruel test when each brother exceeds his grasp — Ian by sleeping outside his class, Terry by losing large at cards — and both turn to their elusive, wealthy uncle for help. Dropped clumsily into the drama, Uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson) is a classic deus ex machina who exists simply to push Terry and Ian toward their fates. He doesn’t make much sense (he swings into London abruptly), but he doesn’t have to; he just has to provide the means for two ordinary men to transform into tragic characters. It’s an old story and it fits Mr. Allen’s pessimism nicely, in part because it’s the kind of old story that predates the modern condition and the therapeutic jabber of which he has been so fond.  “Cassandra’s Dream” owes more to Oedipus Rex than to the Oedipus complex (and something to Claude Chabrol), which doesn’t mean that you can’t put Ian and Terry on the couch. By all means, do. But the pleasures of this modest film are right on the surface, in the upward curve of Mr. McGregor’s lips and the reverse lines of Mr. Farrell’s anguish. Like Mr. Allen’s instrumental visual style — lots of two-shots, simple moves — Mr. McGregor’s easygoing turn takes time getting used to, partly because, as is almost always the case with this director, the actor seems to have been left to his own devices. But the performance sticks like a knife. It delivers force and feeling, as does Mr. Farrell, whose gentleness has rarely been used so effectively.  The rest of the cast fares less well, including Mr. Wilkinson, who never finds the right pitch for his character or the monstrous fury that his most pivotal scene demands. Mr. Allen sets this scene during a rainstorm, which echoes the similarly climactic moment in “Match Point,” when the secret lovers kiss and set destiny on its brutal path. Like all filmmakers, Mr. Allen steals from himself like a magpie, which wouldn’t be grounds for criticism if he were a more dedicated and careful thief. Like many of his later films, though, “Cassandra’s Dream” feels too lightly polished and often rushed, as if he had directed it with a stopwatch. That’s too bad, because while Mr. Allen may feel as if he’s running out of time, he has scarcely run out of ideas.  “Cassandra’s Dream” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Murder most foul.

Like a tragic overture played at the wrong tempo and slightly off-key, Woody Allen's London-set "Cassandra's Dream" sends out more mixed signals than an inebriated telegraphist. On the face of it a "serious Woody," following two brothers embroiled in murder, pic is actually a low-key, bumpy black comedy whose humor stems from the perhaps deliberate awkwardness of the characterizations and dialogue. A relatively easy sit, thanks to energetic perfs by Ewan McGregor and Colin Farrell, pic still fails to satisfy fully on any level. Limited Stateside release is skedded for Nov. 30, but B.O. looks to be a modest dream.
The third consecutive Allen pic to be set in the U.K., but the first to have no Americans in the cast, "Cassandra's Dream" leaves behind the touristy, upper-class p.o.v. of "Match Point" and "Scoop" to go down-and-dirty with more average Londoners. Here's where the problems start, as the dialogue will hardly ring true to native ears, and is played at a rhythm that seems to have been imposed on the cast rather than allowed to grow naturally. Purely at a language level, pic is likely to get wildly different reactions from English speakers both sides of the Pond -- and even more from non-Anglophones who'll be reading subtitles or listening to dubbed voices.
In a piece of casting that's already a stretch, McGregor and Farrell play Cockney brothers Ian and Terry Blaine, respectively, sons of solid, old-fashioned working-class parents (John Benfield and Clare Higgins). Terry, a car mechanic who lives with devoted blonde Kate (Sally Hawkins), is a chronic gambler and drinker who's either flush with cash or in debt up to his eyeballs. Ian, the seemingly more respectable of the pair, runs a restaurant with his dad but wants to expand his horizons by investing in a Californian realty deal. Over the years, the whole family has benefited from the success and generosity of Uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson).
For a while, things look good for the brothers. Thanks to a win at the dogs, Terry is able to buy a small yacht, which they name "Cassandra's Dream" (after the winning greyhound), and in which they relive carefree childhood summers. Then, Ian falls head-over-heels for Angela (Hayley Atwell), a wannabe actress/model whose sex drive is hot-wired to her ambition.
But Terry loses big one day and ends up owing £90,000 ($180,000) to loan sharks who could break his legs. Just when everything looks hopeless for both brothers, Uncle Howard passes through London, but before he'll entertain any handouts, he has a big favor to ask them: to kill a whistle-blowing business colleague, Martin Burns (Phil Davis).
Though neither McGregor nor Farrell plays a de facto Allen character, there are traces of the helmer's screen persona in each, not least the way in which both -- onscreen together for much of the running time -- deliver their dialogue at an unnaturally fast tempo. (Other thesps are more moderato.) There's also an exaggeration to their Cockney accents -- especially Farrell's wobbly attempt at one -- that adds a further unreal flavor.
Such linguistic nuances may not strike non-Brit ears, but the fluctuating line between mordant comedy and stagy drama may. Allen's dialogue never establishes a consistent tone, and often sounds awkward in the Londoners' mouths. Philip Glass' churning, dramatic score, more suited to a Victorian meller, sends out more mixed signals.
Judged as either black comedy or a semi-drama, pic lacks the irony that informs Allen's best movies -- replaced here by a rather condescending attitude toward all the characters.
McGregor, as the stronger brother, and Farrell, as the weaker, keep the movie watchable, even though there's no fraternal chemistry evident on screen. Atwell is well cast as the upper-class, second-rate actress who keeps Ian dangling on a string; ditto Hawkins as Terry's supportive, working-class other half. Among the older members of the cast, who add heft to the smaller roles, Wilkinson emerges the best.
Technical package is pro but lacks the photographic distinction of Allen's previous Brit-set pics. Lensing by Vilmos Zsigmond, encoring with Allen after "Melinda and Melinda," has no special flavor or look, and is downright drab in many interiors.

"I do think the writing is pessimisticall that stuff about life being a tragic experience," says Angela Stark  (played by newcomer Hayley Atwell ) early in Woody Allen 's Cassandra's Dream . An actress talking about the play she's appearing in at a small London theater, Stark could just as well be describing Allen's film, his 38th as writer-director and arguably the bleakest morality play in the bunch. From the Greek-tragedy overtones of its title to the furious string arrangements of Philip Glass 's typically metronomic score, Cassandra's Dream  announces even before the opening credits are over that everyone in the movie is uniformly doomed.
This is the third film Allen has made in London, following 2005's Match Point  and 2006's Scoop , and it adheres fairly closely to the template of the former, in which an ambitious young tennis pro refused to let a little thing like murder slow down his rapid ascent in the British class system. This time, Allen gives us not one but two kids from the wrong side of the Thamesbrothers Terry (Colin Farrell ) and Ian (Ewan McGregor ), who are stuck in dead-end jobs (Terry fixes cars, Ian helps out in the family restaurant) and longing for the good life.
In the movie's opening scene, we see the siblings buying a boat with Terry's winnings from a 60-to-1 dog-track long shot (calledwhat else?Cassandra's Dream), though before long, that same reckless gambling has gotten Terry up to his eyeballs in debt and dodging a couple of loan sharks who would gladly take his kneecaps for payment. Ian, meanwhile, schemes to invest in California hotelsa "surefire" deal, he says, that will also buy him and his actress girlfriend their tickets out of gloomy London.
Enter the brothers' storied uncle Howard (Tom Wilkinson ), a supposedly brilliant and fabulously wealthy surgeon of the plastic variety, who blows in from Beverly Hills (by way of China) and says he'd be more than happy to help his nephews out of their respective binds, provided they do one small favor for him in return: "get rid of" a former colleague who is about to give incriminating testimony against Howard in some sketchily defined "investigation."
And so we arrive back at a couple of favored Allen themes: the vagaries of chance and the ethics of murder. It's roughly the same thorny predicament in which the main characters of Match Point  and Crimes and Misdemeanors  (1989) found themselves, although here you feel the 72-year-old filmmaker working through it with greater inevitability. He never even bothers to reveal the full extent of Howard's supposed wrongdoings, as if his profession alone were enough to account for his lack of scruples. And Allen has loaded up the screenplay with bits of dialogue that rather thuddingly encapsulate the movie's cosmic view: "The whole of human life is about violence; it's a cruel world, Terry," says Ian, in an effort to egg on his skittish sibling. "Nobody wants to be selfish, but everybody is," echoes the boys' proud, working-class dad.
In those and other respects, Cassandra's Dream  (scheduled to open for an Oscar-qualifying run last month before being unceremoniously bumped to January) feels like one of Allen's laziest pieces of writing and direction, leaden with heavy metaphor and characters who rarely make it beyond the archetypemarionettes in a miserablist puppet theater. And though it was probably being shot at around the same time, Allen's film has been done no favors by arriving in theaters several months after Sidney Lumet 's vastly superior tale of bloodied family ties, Before the Devil Knows You're Dead . Cassandra's Dream  isn't an aggressively bad movie like the tone-deaf Scoop  and Hollywood  Ending  (2002); it's merely a monotonous one that lacks the mordant humor, Highsmithian intrigue, and rippling sexuality that made Match Point  his strongest work in a decade.
Here, the pleasures are strictly incidental: Farrell, who plays his one-dimensional character with an affecting mixture of boyish naïveté and tragic inevitability, and the tall, lithe Atwell, who Allen films as rhapsodically as he did Scarlett Johansson , and whose husky voice similarly ripples with unquenched desire. It's a pity that both of them are stuck in roles at least one rewrite away from being worthy of their abilities.
