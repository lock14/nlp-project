The boys and girls of summer get a Mach-5 work-over in the newest big bang theory from Rob Cohen (XXX
, The Fast and the Furious
), which semicompetently welds 2001
�s amoral HAL 9000 computer to the Top Gun
 school of flight- and filmcraft, making for a supremely silly but ultimately fun popcorn shoot-�em-up. The twitchy tweener next to me offered running commentary along the lines of "awesome!!!" and "kickass!!!", but Cohen�s film, despite its video-game, user-friendly toggles � clearly marked "Adrenaline" and "More Adrenaline" � plays like a slapdash assemblage of the greatest hits of conspiracy-minded action cinema. Apart from the pointedly obvious Kubrick and Tony Scott references, Stealth
 also mines everything from John Badham�s 1983 renegade chopper opus Blue Thunder
 to, uh, John Badham�s 1983 renegade computer opus WarGames
, and, just for laffs, John Badham�s 1986 war-bot comedy Short Circuit
. Sadly, the humor here is apparently unintentional and Ally Sheedy is nowhere to be found, but tonal quibbles such as these pale when confronted by the sheer Richter-trembling magnitude of Cohen�s bravura use of CGI and a 100-ton gimbal (used to spin and gyrate the actors inside the prop-cockpits), courtesy of Digital Domain and special effects supervisor John Frazier, respectively. The script, from sometime genre favorite W.D. Richter (Big Trouble in Little China
), is a hamfisted collection of cornball military clich�s that frequently cross over into Absurdistan airspace before vectoring back toward the friendly skies of sci-fi, but even that fails to put much of a dent in the mental-whiplash-inducing forward motion of this two-hours-plus film. (To Cohen�s credit, it feels like a swift 90.) The plot? Elite U.S. Navy fliers and Best Friends 4-Ever Gannon (Lucas), Wade (Biel), and Purcell (Foxx) are assigned a new wingman by their thorny overseer Capt. Cummings (Shepard, doing Chuck Yeager gone sour). The new wingman is not a human being but instead an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle acronymed EDI (for Extreme Deep Invader), which was created by the Navy and Richard Roxburgh�s Dr. Keith Orbit in the hopes of someday replacing flyboys (and -girls) altogether. Team leader Gannon has his doubts and says as much after the robotic EDI disobeys a direct order and turns a nuke-empowered terrorist cell into pink mist in the mountains of the former Soviet Union, but like Plan 9 From Outer Space
�s crusading pilot Jeff Trent, he�s "muzzled by Army brass." Well, Navy brass, really, but either way a conspiracy is afoot and when EDI is struck by lightning after a particularly treacherous mission, the UCAV begins to think for itself and decides, not unwisely for the benefit of the audience, that it�s fun to blow things up. What follows is a circuitous route to redemption for almost all involved, replete with WW III-inducing skirmishes with the Russian Federation air force and despot-du-jour Kim Jong Il. It�s Hollywood hokum in extremis, and while the Gannon/Wade romantic-competition subplot threatens to ground the film every quarter-hour or so, Cohen�s mastery of the big-budget aerial action sequences repeatedly acts as a epinephrine jab to the heart of what might have otherwise been a high flying DOA.


"Stealth" is a pretty fair military-hardware action movie until you start thinking about it -- at which point it turns incredibly sour in your mouth. I can therefore recommend it to any and all audiences lacking higher brain functions. Sea cucumbers, perhaps. Ones waving American flags.
I certainly can't recommend it to fans of Jamie Foxx, because the best actor Oscar winner for "Ray" is stuck in the deeply secondary role of the hero's best friend. Since "Stealth" was filmed before the Academy Awards, Foxx can take some solace in the fact that he won't ever have to accept this kind of jive part again.
As for Josh Lucas and Jessica Biel as Navy stealth-fighter jet pilots in love with flying and (in a don't-ask-don't-tell sort of way) each other, they exhibit markedly less personality than EDI (pronounced "Eddie"), the unmanned computerized drone plane that has just become the fourth member of their elite squadron. EDI speaks in the friendly metallic tones of HAL 9000's grandson and he's equipped with the latest advances in artificial intelligence. Artificial or not, this gives him a leg up on everyone in the film.
Lieutenants Ben Gannon (Lucas), Kara Wade (Biel), and Henry Purcell (Foxx) are not happy about bringing Robo-plane along on their tactical missions, but the project is the baby of their commanding officer, Captain George Cummings (Sam Shepard), who has that win-at-all-costs evil glint in his eye. W.D. Richter's script even makes a feint toward ethical debate: "I just don't think war should become a video game," says Ben, upon which Cummings reminds him about the body bags. A scene or two later, Kara insists that "if it's programmed by moral people, it'll be moral," but since she subsequently announces she has to go "pee-pee," mature strategic analysis may not be the character's strong suit.
Anyway, such conundrums are moot, since the director is Rob Cohen of "XXX" and "The Fast and the Furious," and he has stuff to blow up. After the squadron's successful strike on a terrorist cell in Rangoon, EDI is hit by lightning, has its AI scrambled, and becomes jealous of Ben's prowess in the sky. The drone plane turns on the others and heads out to blow up a warlord's stockpile of moldering Russian nukes; Ben scrambles to reel the stray back in while Cummings plots how best to save his career. While "Stealth" offers a superficial portrait of the "new Navy" -- white, black, female -- Lucas quickly becomes the movie's blue-eyed top gun, while Foxx is sidelined and Biel's Kara has to bail out of her stalled Talon fighter. Over North Korea -- where else?
The sequence in which she plummets to earth, dodging the fireball remnants of her jet, is a pulse-quickening visual marvel, by far the strongest moment in the film. All the action sequences, in fact, are everything summer-movie fans could hope for: digitized bursts of retinal overstimulation that play like -- you guessed it -- a video game. EDI's in-cockpit taste for Incubus songs, written by the band for the film, provides the requisite music to pump fists by, although the duet with the Pretenders' Chrissie Hynde over the final credits comes as a shock. Chrissie, honey, did you even read the script? (As for Shepard's participation, presumably there are college bills to pay, and revivals of "True West" just aren't doing the trick.)
The issue isn't the quality of the action scenes, because these days that's mostly what Hollywood is good for. The issue isn't even the lurking fears of Defense Department ordnance run amok that "Stealth" purports to address. The issue is that this is exactly the sort of movie we don't need right now: a delusional military fantasy in which collateral damage doesn't exist.
That initial strike involves dropping an "implosion bomb" on an apartment building in downtown Rangoon that's miraculously occupied only by the terrorists; the cute kids next door remain unhurt. Later, when EDI's assault on the warlord causes radioactive dust to drift over a nearby village, Kara calls in the medics to relieve the terrified villagers -- with what? Gatorade? -- and that's the last we hear of that. Oh, a few North Korean soldiers get killed, but they're as one-dimensional as Purcell's willowy Thai girlfriend (Jaipetch Toonchalong), who nods and smiles uncomprehendingly as he mumbles about the human cost of war.
Am I spoiling the party? Harshing the high-flying flyboy buzz? Tough. For a movie to pretend, in the face of the deaths of tens of thousands of Iraqi men, women, and children directly or indirectly caused by our presence there, that we can wage war without anyone really
 getting hurt isn't naive, or wishful thinking, or a jim-dandy way to spend a Saturday night at the movies. It's an obscenity.


         If you're going to steal, you might as well steal big. "Stealth" has pilfered from "Top Gun," "2001: A Space Odyssey" and a few other places to produce a slick piece of summer entertainment that is counting on elaborate special effects to make its derivative, convoluted story line all but irrelevant.
 
  Though "Stealth" stars Josh Lucas, Jessica Biel and Jamie Foxx as a charismatic trio of hotshot Navy fliers freshly minted for the new millennium, the filmmakers appear more interested in how their planes can be made to fly than who is flying them.
 


         






    Much of the "Stealth" press material is given over to director Rob Cohen's enthusiasm for a 100-ton gimbal specially made to re-create jet plane movements and his wonder at Tergen, a computerized system for matching those moves to actual terrain. Even Maverick and Ice Man would have been impressed.
 
  Cohen, whose previous films include big earners like "The Fast and the Furious" and "XXX," certainly knows how to keep things busy. In addition to all that flying, there are lots of blinking computer screens, an explosion so big it had to be registered with NASA, not to mention a year's worth of whooshing noises on the soundtrack.
 
  The trio of pilots, looking good in the requisite slow-motion flight-suited walk down an aircraft carrier deck, are prouder than punch to be flying top-secret stealth fighter jets called Talons for Capt. George Cummings (Sam Shepard, always a treat in military roles).
 
  Then Cummings announces the addition of a fourth member of the team. It's not a person, its EDI (Extreme Deep Invader), Eddie for short, a plane flown by artificial intelligence. Described as having "a brain like a quantum sponge" (where can I get one of those?), Eddie doesn't do things by half measures: When it decides to download songs from the Web, it downloads every last one of them.
 
  Just like the pilots in "Top Gun," Eddie gets a nickname. The team calls him Tin Man, though, given the plane's general shape and coloration, Dung Beetle might have been more appropriate. But no matter. Once his HAL-type voice pipes up and says, "It is good to be part of the squadron," we all know that it's just a matter of time before Eddie gets too big for his britches and starts to think he's smarter than his human handlers.
 
  "Stealth," however, is not content to stop here. Perhaps fearful that such a clear story line would not fascinate, it adds on all manner of extraneous bits and pieces of plot until what results resembles an out-of-work screenwriter's garage sale.
 
  These add-ons include a ground combat sequence that looks left over from an old Korean War movie, a steal from George Bernard Shaw's "Androcles and the Lion," supersecret blather about air bases not on any map, even a pointless R&R sequence likely included to get Biel and Lucas, whose characters are secretly sweet on each other, into flattering swimwear.
 
  The script by veteran W.D. Richter also has its share of technical and military language: When someone says "hostile at 6 o'clock," he's not referring to evening drinks with the boss. As if they didn't have enough to worry about, actors also have to be able to say lines like "Where's the fire, skipper?" and "My fuel is low and half of Russia will be up here any minute" as if they had some connection to reality. It can't be easy.
 
  Finally, though, the diversion of aircraft acrobatics obviates the need to take anything anyone does or says too seriously. This is a summer fantasy, after all, and in this day and age, the notion that we have the skill to take out dangerous terrorist cells in the blink of an eye with zero collateral damage is one fantasy a lot of folks would like to buy into.

There's a new threat among us. It is faceless and fiendishly intelligent, with only one goal: to destroy its enemies. It feeds on technology, but also on something darker, gathering information it stores in an all-seeing nerve center. How dark is it? Let's just say this: It has downloaded every last song available on the Internet. Look out, al-Qaeda!
In Stealth , a high-velocity, low-concept sky-attack thriller, the world is under siege by terrorists and rogue warlords, but the real danger is a foe more homegrown and familiar: your new wingman. It is not a man at all, you see, but a top secret American droid fighter plane that thinks and flies all by itself, operating entirely by computer. Nicknamed ''Eddie,'' its actual moniker being the acronym EDI (so clever), it looks like a giant copper stingray, with a pulsating blue marble of a brain housed in its cockpit, and it even talks  in a voice meant to evoke HAL, the ominously sensitive computer-with-feelings from 2001: A Space Odyssey . EDI is programmed to kill, but when he speaks, in those dulcet tones of servitude, he's like KITT from Knight Rider  on his wimpiest day. He's so icky-fey that he sounds as if he's warming up to play Felix in a dinner-theater production of The Odd Couple .
The job of breaking in this awesome hunk of machinery has fallen to Ben (Josh Lucas), Kara (Jessica Biel), and Henry (Jamie Foxx), an elite task force of Naval Air Force pilots who are used to working as a close-knit trio. They have no desire to take on a fourth member of the team, let alone one that isn't human. The decision, however, has already been made by their commanding officer (Sam Shepard), a sinister crew-cut firebrand who is plugged into the corridors of power.
The creators of Stealth  have devised what sounds like a shrewdly corrupt strategy for having their bombs-away excess and eating it, too. Directed by Rob Cohen, the youth-action pulp packager who made The Fast and the Furious  and XXX , the movie, with its opening crawl about fighting ''the enemy'' and its demagogic grab bag of global threats, was obviously conceived as a Top Gun  for the new millennium: a fantasy of good-looking kids in hyperspeed planes zapping evil out of the sky. Stealth  is full of whooshing jet engines, hurtling landings on aircraft carriers, and lava orange fireballs  the standard aerial military videogame porn. Except that it's EDI the droid cruiser that gets to do all the macho-decadent, neo-'80s ass-kicking stuff; it even blasts cruddy power-synth rock & roll. This allows Lucas' Ben, the group's hot-dog renegade of a leader, to remain a good liberal citizen, and for the movie to pander to xenophobic war-on-terror absolutism without falling into it. Ordered to target a Tajikistani warlord who is parading a cache of nuclear weapons, Ben rejects the assignment, recoiling at any possibility of collateral damage. It's EDI, the programmed superfighter, who blasts first and asks questions later. He's the one who needs to have his wings clipped.
I went into Stealth  hoping that its talented cast might make it more entertaining than it had any right to be. Yet the stars are asked to chew on the driest of technobabble, and to strike poses of flyboy and flygirl moxie that make them look callow rather than heroic. Josh Lucas, with his junior Kevin Costner dreamboat-hayseed sexiness, is an appealing actor with a wholesome, easy style, but he needs to tone down his crinkled glow of self-love. It's almost bizarre to see Jamie Foxx in a role this lightweight after his complex triumph in Ray . (Stealth  was shot before he won the Oscar.) When he isn't strapped into his cockpit, Foxx doesn't get to do much besides strut, flirt, and spin a basketball; he brings little to the party apart from airy self-mockery. Jessica Biel, on the other hand, is so out of her depth that the movie's biggest mistake was to strand her in North Korea. Her parachute crash landing is Stealth 's one truly harrowing action sequence, but whenever the film cuts to her ragged scramble to the border, it stops dead.
In all the attacks on liberal Hollywood, it is often forgotten that Top Gun , a movie that might almost have been commissioned by the Navy, was a perfect pop paradigm of Reaganite swagger. Stealth , a dregs-of-summer knockoff, is too ponderous and inept to serve a comparable function now, yet the film's lack of thrust may be related to an absence of conviction about its own war-is-a-videogame clichés. On some level, the people who made this movie understand that it's no longer hip, the way that it was 20 years ago, to sit in a chair and cheer as other people fight.

 The sight of Jessica Biel wiggling her shapely rear through the North Korean backcountry in the action flick "Stealth" isn't the most ludicrous image of our current movie season, but it comes close. As it happens, the most preposterous moment in this preposterous crypto-video game occurs after Ms. Biel's character, a United States naval pilot, parachutes from her stealth aircraft through a hailstorm of fiery debris, races across North Korea while chased by thugs with guns, and rushes into the arms of the man who risks worldwide nuclear holocaust to rescue her. Thanks, dude!  A hash of "Top Gun" and "Behind Enemy Lines," among myriad other influences, and topped with a soupçon of "2001," this story of three comrades up against a villainous miscellany has the makings of a kitsch classic. Any film that places romance above Armageddon and forces a fine actor like Josh Lucas to parade around in a swimsuit like a model for International Male would certainly seem to have the appropriate wrong stuff. Too bad that the screenwriter W. D. Richter and the director Rob Cohen, who has almost extinguished all the good will he built up from "The Fast and the Furious," don't seem in on the joke. Nor do members of  the cast, which includes Jamie Foxx and Sam Shepard, crack many smiles, despite the inherent hilarity of the material.  Set in the very near future during, as an opening scroll explains, the "mounting threat of terrorism," the story hinges on three stealth pilots - Ms. Biel's Kara, Mr. Lucas's Ben and Mr. Foxx's improbably named Henry Purcell - who zip around the globe putting out fires, fanning flames and swapping chummy barbs with Mr. Shepard's commanding officer. The pilots get along splendidly, but bashful Kara and flirty Ben look as if they would like to do more than pal around. Hence Mr. Lucas and Ms. Biel's swimsuit duet during a pointless sojourn in Thailand, an exotic backdrop for the usual military R&R (beautiful locals with negligible English skills, etc.) and the only foreign country that these happy three visit and don't shoot up.  One of the pleasures of entertainments like the Bond films is that they work as a sort of travelogue, taking us places we've never been  (or at least to convincing facsimiles) and opening us to the world. Not so "Stealth," which, other than that Thailand layover, inspires no such wanderlust. The reason isn't that the film was mostly shot in Australia, which almost always looks inviting; rather, it's that almost every locale gets blown to bits almost as soon as the pilots come within shooting distance. Among the less fortunate territories: Myanmar, Tajikistan, North Korea and a corner of Alaska, all of which come under intense fire.  It's no wonder that in "Stealth" the planet usually looks better from 35,000 feet above ground, a vantage point that makes everything - including people, who alternately look like ants and characters in a video game - seem awfully distant and terribly unreal.  What's interesting about "Stealth" isn't its nitwit story, which largely involves a next-generation aircraft operated by a computer with a voice meant to evoke HAL 9000 that sounds more like an interminably snotty hotel clerk right before a phone bounces off his head. No, what's interesting about this movie - and many others of its kind - is that it continues the love affair Hollywood, that hotbed of liberalism, has long had with militarism. As is almost always the case in these movies, the fall guy here turns out to be a rogue bad apple who, though abetted by black-bag types and a shadowy politician, is lodged in an otherwise unsullied bushel of warriors. Like Kara, these boys fret about collateral damage, but are more obsessed with big bangs than little people.    "Stealth" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has a lot of explosions, a number of bloodless deaths and some adult language.

Aiming to join the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay school of American movie war games, "Stealth" is just too dumb to make the grade. Director Rob Cohen's fifth high-speed production with producer Neal H. Moritz ("XXX," "The Fast and the Furious") turns near-future Air Force jets guided by artificial intelligence into objects for thrill rides and nearly erotic pleasure while warning of a corrupt Pentagon at the core. As similarly a silly semi-sci fi actioner as Bay's "The Island," and with Jamie Foxx (thesping here before his Oscar win) relegated to a backup position, "Stealth" probably won't stay airborne for too long. 
Pic launches in an old-fashioned manner, establishing the tight relationship of crewmates Lt. Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas), Lt. Kara Wade (Jessica Biel) and Lt. Henry Purcell (Foxx). Trio, which reports to stern, craggy-faced Capt. George Cummings (Sam Shepard), was chosen from a field of naval air candidates to fly the latest brand of stealth fighters designed to instantly respond to sightings of terrorists anywhere in the world.
Although detail of Cummings' political allies in Washington is briefly inserted and revisited from time to time, pic's action essentially rubber-stamps the belief that U.S. air power can and will attack any point on the planet.
Once the crew is greenlit for duty on the USS Abraham Lincoln, Cummings surprises them with the introduction of a robotic fighter jet nicknamed "EDI." The pilot-less craft EDI can fly and drop payloads without human emotion getting in the way.
Test flight with this added "wingman" turns into a full-blown attack on a downtown Rangoon high-rise where an international terrorist cell is housed. Gannon proves he can pull the attack off solo without EDI's aid, but, alas, on the return to base EDI is zapped by a lightning bolt, triggering some erratic behavior.
"Stealth" mimics the Hal plot from "2001" in a way that falls uneasily between good-natured spoof and tribute. Besides the three-letter moniker, Wentworth Miller's slightly effeminate tone as EDI's voice copies Douglas Rain's vocal performance as HAL. The idea that the computer gains a mind of its own is also repeated here, and even a scene where two concerned guys try to conceal themselves from EDI while talking about him echoes the pre-intermission climax of Kubrick's sci fi masterwork.
After a Bruckheimeresque R&R sidetrip to Thailand, where Gannon and Wade declare they have the hots for each other without so much as a smooch, the trio is back with EDI. Ignoring Wade's order to back off from bombing a nuclear-armed terrorist camp in Tajikistan, EDI goes on the attack, leaving the humans no choice but to join in.
"Stealth" distastefully visualizes the resulting radioactive cloud as a briefly seen visual effect, and though it's on course to poison large swathes of the Near East all the way to Pakistan, this fact is ignored for the rest of the movie.
Instead, story focuses on EDI vs. crew, with Purcell easily dispatched (making this one of Foxx's most thankless roles), and Wade's plane damaged enough that she must eject over North Korea. For five minutes, pic is genuinely astonishing in its detailed, visceral and stratospheric depiction of Wade's plummeting to the ground in a damaged parachute.
As Wade tries to elude capture (with pic borrowing from "Behind Enemy Lines"), the rest of "Stealth" is taken over by Lucas' Gannon, as he tries to wrest control and have EDI re-wired by his slickster Seattle-based creator, Keith Orbit (Richard Roxburgh).
For pic to tie story in with Washington politics, actual science or authentic military strategy adds a false veneer of seriousness to what's really an expensive CGI-stoked war movie. With characters barely sketched, the movie's moral concerns are less important than visual effects supervisor Joel Hynek's teeth-rattling skill at projecting cool weapons doing major damage.
Lucas shifts out of his usual supporting bad-guy stints, but he makes Gannon's self-confidence look almost snide. Biel impresses most when talking less and running more. Shepard does better in his other life as a playwright.
As Cohen's films continue to grow pricier, they're both more and more humorless while looking more technically impressive, and he enjoys fine support with ace technicians like Hynek, lenser Dean Semler and production designers J. Michael Riva and Jonathan Lee. Techno music vet BT delivers a stiff military score liberally quoting from Hans Zimmer.

In Stealth , three elite navy pilots discover that their new wingman is an unmanned bomber with an electronic mind. The human trio fear that their finely honed skills will become obsolete and their careers subordinated to the powers of advanced machinery. With good reason, for such a fate has apparently befallen Hollywood  screenwriters.
The e-noggin in question is an illuminated, marbleized sphere gewgawed with various metallic doohickeys, which sits, R2-D2-like, inside the cockpit. When removed for maintenance, it resembles either the world's most tricked-out bowling ball or something found trapped in the claws of a very large pewter dragon. Its soft male speech patterns (yes . . . it talks) at first recall the passive-aggressive parley of 2001 's HAL, but after being struck by lightning and thereby gaining a malevolent sentience, the super-drone becomes a bit bitchier, more in the vein of Knight Rider  's KITT. Once the rogue jet starts bombing targets with complete disregard for civilian collateral damage (unlike the humans, who do the moral arithmetic moments before potential strikes), much of the narrative consists of attempts to get this deadly embodiment of taxpayer money back to base unharmed. Because, ultimately, it's the only brain this picture has.
Probably pitched as Top Gun  meets Terminator , Stealth  is more along the slapdash lines of Iron  Eagle II meets Short Circuit . Its action sequences, more geeky than thrilling, fail to rescue the laughable plot. But like Top Gun , this gas-guzzling gearhead trip from director Rob Cohen  (The Fast and the Furious ) was made with the support of the real-life U.S. Navy although only assiduous credit hounds would notice. Along with the other armed forces branches, the navy allows access to bases, equipment, and personnel for select projects after approving scripts to make sure they present an "accurate" depiction of service life; such joint efforts, the thinking goes, can enhance the military's public image and aid recruitment efforts.
Thus, the navy's depicted as a cool, high-tech place for ambitious career professionals. The triple protags' demographics are poster perfect: the cocky white hunk (Josh Lucas ), the ultra-honorablebut still hotfemale "wingm'n" (Jessica Biel ), and the fun-loving black pilot (Jamie Foxx ), who calls his career "the flyest job you'll ever have." Over cocktails on a lavish R&R junket in Thailand  (join the navy, see the world), they debate the merits of their computerized co-fighter with the gravity of an Annapolis  ethics seminar. "It's neutral," says Biel. "If it's controlled by moral people, then it will be moral." Trouble is, once created, those darned weapons systems sometimes get in the hands of immoral people, as evidenced by a Tajik warlord who schleps a few pilfered nukes via oxen team into his medieval castle. Important lessons, perhaps, but is the navy's image boosted if audiences guffaw at an unintentionally hilarious scene of Biel emergency parachuting over North Korea , verbally reporting every piece of fiery shrapnel that smacks her en route? If we're going to be fighting the war on terror in perpetuity, could we at least get better movies out of it?
