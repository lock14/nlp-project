Fans of director Hanson�s recent films � 8 Mile
, Wonder Boys
, and L.A. Confidential
 � will likely wonder what the director of such guy-oriented movies is doing suddenly helming this quintessential women�s picture � or chick flick, to use the vernacular. They�re forgetting what a fantastic director of actors he is, one that coaxes terrific performances from nonactors like Eminem, and better-than-usual performances from pros like Kim Basinger, Michael Douglas, Russell Crowe, and Kevin Spacey. In In Her Shoes
, Cameron Diaz delivers the best and most nuanced performance of her career, Shirley MacLaine turns in the most restrained and touching performance of her more recent career, and Toni Collette gets to trade in her kooky character acting for a lovely and attractive star turn. If this were all Hanson managed to accomplish with this sisters-in-emotional-crisis movie then he still will have released the best chick flick of the year so far. However, it is also possible to see within In Her Shoes
 themes that resonate throughout Hanson�s work: character doubles that fulfill the other half as Bud and Edmund do in L.A. Confidential
, and coming-of-age predicaments that are more accurately the coming-out from a prolonged adolescence like Eminem�s Rabbit in 8 Mile
 or Douglas� pot-addled writer in Wonder Boys
. Hanson takes a prosaic and overly schematic script by Erin Brockovich
 screenwriter Susannah Grant (who adapted from the novel by Jennifer Weiner) and spins it into box-office gold. Diaz�s Maggie and Collette�s Rose play sisters who are opposites in every way, except that since a young age they have both been motherless girls who are unwelcome in the home of their crummy stepmother and passive dad. Maggie is an irresponsible good-time girl whose job opportunities are limited by her closet dyslexia; Rose is a single lawyer who sops the plainness of her life by buying dozens of designer shoes. When she oversteps the tolerant generosity of her sister, Maggie hightails it to an assisted living community in Florida where Ella (MacLaine), the grandmother she never knew she had, lives. While there, her grandmother helps provide her with a work ethic and career, a dying man (Lloyd) has her read Elizabeth Bishop poems aloud to him and consequently resolves her reading disorder, she learns compassion for those she loves, and gains a truer picture of the legacy of her dead mother. It�s all a bit much for one comic weepie, but In Her Shoes
 maintains a breezy charm throughout and contains many extremely funny sequences. At times, the continuous crosscutting between the two sisters feels as though the film is clobbering home the idea of the women as each other�s complement, but even if these Shoes
 are not perfectly stitched the fit is nevertheless comfortable and the look is polished.


To any woman reading this who has one or more living grandmothers: Ignore my measly 2 1/2-star rating, call up Grams, put her in the car, take her to see "In Her Shoes." You can thank me later.
The rest of us will just have to suspend our disbelief and accept that A) Cameron Diaz and Toni Collette could be sisters in any known universe, alternate or otherwise, B) that Shirley MacLaine could be the nice Jewish grandparent they never knew existed, and C) that MacLaine could give the most understated performance in the movie.
"In Her Shoes" says there's nothing wrong with modern womanhood that moving to your bubbe's Florida retirement community can't fix, and if it has to stack its cards higher than the John Hancock Tower to put it over, at least the cast brings oxygen. And high heels. Lots of high heels.
Based on Jennifer Weiner's 2002 novel, "In Her Shoes" offers us the Feller sisters, trampy bombshell Maggie (Diaz) and dowdy lawyer Rose (Collette). The former is a dyslexic roundheels first seen seducing, then throwing up on, a stranger in the bathroom of a high school reunion. Clearly, some moral growth is in order. The latter is a workaholic frump with a closet full of Jimmy Choos and a fear of wearing them. The history of their relationship has been: Maggie gets the guy, Maggie goes too far, Rose bails Maggie out. Rose is tired of bailing Maggie out, and who wouldn't be? In a nice if not especially deep turn, Diaz plays Maggie as a big baby whose charm has long expired.
The movie splits in two when Maggie discovers a cache of letters that lead her to Ella Hirsch (MacLaine), the grandmother her father (Ken Howard) exiled after the long-ago death of the girls' mother. Sensing a family connection and a source of ready cash to exploit, Maggie appears in Ella's retirement community for an extended stay, causing legions of codgers to blow their shuffleboard shots as she jogs by. Secrets are aired, feelings shared, anger bared as a Greek chorus of old-timers led by Jerry Adler and the 80-year-old Francine Beers nod sagely. The latter cruises through the movie on a go-cart, like some sort of emotional motorcycle cop.
Rose, meanwhile, is back in Philadelphia coming to grips with her nonlife and trying to embrace the opposite. Since this is a movie, that involves weight loss and dogs. Also a dog of a co-worker (Richard Burgi) and a more suitable suitor (Mark Feuerstein) who the movie seems to think is quite the catch but who might strike some as a Type-A noodge from whom Rose would best tiptoe quietly away. There's an evil stepmom, too, played with perfect aggravating obliviousness by Candice Azzara; a wedding shower during which the character humiliates Rose is the sort of scene "In Her Shoes" does mortifyingly well. We all have our family loves and loathings, and the movie pokes at them until it hurts. Then it slaps on a big Band-Aid.
Director Curtis Hanson, the gifted journeyman of "L.A. Confidential" and "8 Mile," has asked that his movie not be labeled a "chick flick," but that's of course what it is, and what's wrong with that? An honorable if not honored genre, ch--k fl--ks traffic in the fraying and retying of emotional bonds; they're where audiences -- male and
 female -- get to see their domestic problems discussed and smoothed over. They offer necessary lies and, at best, entertaining and provocative ones.
"In Her Shoes" is entertaining enough, but it's more pat than provocative -- this is what makes it a bona fide audience pleaser while keeping it from drawing real blood. It's the kind of movie that lets Maggie haltingly read Elizabeth Bishop's "One Art," only to suck the mystery out of the poem's grave, uncompromising stanzas by having a blind retired professor (Norman Lloyd) explain them to her (and us) one by one.
But this isn't a movie about subtlety -- it's about things finally said rather than left unsaid -- and that makes MacLaine's performance even more marvelous. Ella has been burned by life and by family, and she's giving nothing away, certainly not to the blond young tootsie eyeing the bankroll in the sock drawer. Of course Ella unbends -- that's what movies are for -- but MacLaine calls on all her invisible skills to make the process seem fresh and hard-earned. Your grandma will believe, even if a critic doesn't.


         A slow journey into the deepest heart of the smart-versus-pretty conundrum, Curtis Hanson's "In Her Shoes" explores the benighted bond between a frumpish workaholic lawyer named Rose Feller (Toni Collette) and her beautiful, reckless sex monkey of a sister, Maggie (Cameron Diaz). With nothing in common but their shoe size and low self-esteem, the sisters must break apart to come together again, redeemed by the love of a good man and a wise grandmother.
 
  Adapted by Susannah Grant from the novel by Jennifer Weiner, "In Her Shoes" is a curious movie, hovering for upward of two hours between light and dark, truth and fake uplift, menace and mollycoddling. The effect is that of a storm cloud strapped into something constricting by Victoria's Secret. There's a dark-edged honesty to Collette, Diaz and Shirley MacLaine's performances that chafes against the source story's eagerness to please. Maybe it has to do with Collette and Diaz being slightly older than the sisters in the book, or with the fact that Hanson — who directed "Wonder Boys," "L.A. Confidential" and "8 Mile" — keeps sending the sisters down dark emotional alleyways of the soul only to have sunny days and saviors waiting around the corner.
 


         






    Successful-but-lonely Rose is marveling at her handsome boss' surprise presence in her bed when she gets a late-night phone call from a stranger. Maggie has passed out drunk at her high school reunion, and Rose needs to come pick her up. When she tries to take Maggie back to their father's house, however, she's barred at the door by their evil stepmother, who insists Rose take her sister home with her. A few days later, Maggie returns to her dad's to collect her things and one last time rifle through his desk drawers, where she comes across a stack of unopened birthday cards, evidence of a grandmother they hadn't known existed. Back at Rose's apartment, she helps herself to expensive shoes (carefully preserved beauty totems that Rose never wears), ice cream and other stuff sisters know better than to borrow. Evicted yet again, she boards a bus to Florida without a word to anyone. Rose, meanwhile, quits her job and stumbles into a gig walking dogs, gaining a new boyfriend (Mark Feuerstein) in the process.
 
  Not having read the novel, I suspect that Maggie is written as some sort of irresponsible blithe spirit with issues. But Diaz plays her as a scary, vulpine mess. Her cool, grifter amorality is as shocking as her coarse, cynical sex appeal, both of which make it nearly impossible to buy her as Rose's sister in any context other than tragedy. She's too lost, too far gone for the comfy middle-class parameters of the movie, with its dear-old-dads, wisecracking biddies and puppy-eyed Prince Charmings.
 
  Collette's goofy charm goes a long way in making Rose as likable as she's meant to be, but under scrutiny the character doesn't hold up. She never owns up to her resentment of her sister, nor does she ever overcome it enough to look for her. Even after the movie has carefully established that Maggie is a heavy drinker who may be mentally ill and is definitely a danger to herself, Rose never tells Simon that Maggie is missing, nor does she tell her father or, for that matter, the cops. Grandma Ella (MacLaine), meanwhile, has taken Maggie on as a project, finding her a gig as a hospice worker and helping her start a business as a personal shopper for the assisted-living set. In light of the sisters' past, however, the notion that Ella "did her best" by her motherless granddaughters by sending annual birthday cards, though it is pushed like a tanking stock to a database of AARP subscribers, is a tough sell.
 
  The ups and downs of sibling love between damaged opposites have been poignantly explored in movies like Kenneth Lonergan's "You Can Count On Me." And Sandra Goldbacher's little-seen "Me Without You," the story of a lifelong best friendship between a shy, serious girl, blind to her own appeal, and her flashy, needy neighbor, who sees it all too clearly, explores similar themes to profound effect. But "In Her Shoes" isn't interested in parsing the mysteries of the love-hate relationship as much as it is invested (literally) in selling the message that everything's going to be OK. For Rose, the path to redemption is paved with love and all the rewards attendant to reduced hindquarters. For Maggie, it's littered with newly found self-respect, wisdom and, well, yes, poetry. But "In Her Shoes" treats love like a pretty accessory to be stored in a plastic box and shoved in the back of a closet when it proves impractical. And ultimately, it's too self-conscious of its role in the marketplace and too hamstrung by its source material to risk being honest at the expense of being liked.

Before contemplating the mind-bending Hollywood notion of bikini-clad Hispanic shiksa goddess Cameron Diaz playing a Jewish granddaughter surrounded by elderly Miami shuffleboard mavens in the learn-and-hug comedy In Her Shoes , let us pause to salute the familiar sight of scarf-draped Shirley MacLaine playing a mother  in this case also a grandmother  who's far from sure that the whole maternal route is for her. MacLaine's alpha Golden Girl Ella Hirsch may hail, nominally, from a culture of chopped liver, but the character is related to every tough, nonsectarian, drive-your-daughter-crazy bird the actress has played from Terms of Endearment  to Bewitched . And once again, the old broad plays an old broad like an old lioness pawing her cubs.
The widowed Ella makes an inconstant Jewish grandma  she's the rare member of her retirement community who doesn't speak with the inflections of a lifelong bagel eater  but she's a rock for her younger granddaughter, Maggie (Diaz), who shows up at Ella's Florida condo door one day after screwing up her life back home in Philadelphia. As novelist Jennifer Weiner decreed in the popular specimen of chick lit on which the movie is based, Maggie is a promiscuous man-magnet who can barely read, an irresponsible slob who can't hold a job.
On the other hand, Maggie's older sister, Rose (Toni Collette), is a frumpy workaholic who can't find a man, depressed by her apparently hopeless state of being overweight and overstocked with refrigerated tubs of ice cream. (Through the fun-house mirror of Hollywood, the miseries of obesity have been reduced to size 10 worries.) The two fight like fats-and-thins, but they're also bound by love, siblings made motherless at an early age who are united in their love of expensive footwear. After a giant squabble, will the two reconcile? Will Rose find love with a nice Jewish boy? Will Maggie grow up? Will MacLaine grab an Oscar nomination in the Supporting Actress category with her bare teeth? You have to ask?
The book is satisfying  and dissatisfying  in the standard way such target-audience literature always is: The plot math is neat, the cultural references are easy, the jokes are sitcom-honed, all the ancillary players have their exits and their entrances. The movie, though, satisfies and frustrates in ways unique to viewer expectations for a production directed by Curtis Hanson, esteemed for his ability to communicate sociological color. Could it be that the director of L.A. Confidential , Wonder Boys , and 8 Mile  has been defeated by characters on a first-name basis with brisket, by women who, in Susannah Grant's screenplay, represent avatars of joyless workaholism and joyless sexaholism?
Diaz continues to get mileage out of shaking her friendly booty  the clean/dirty party girl of a young man's dreams  and Collette continues her work in the field of plain/pretty femininity. But it's a slipshod movie indeed when even MacLaine can be upstaged by professional little-old-Jewish-lady player Francine Beers as Ella's neighbor, zooming around in her senior go-cart: Here, at least, is one character rooted in a real place, who knows how to kibitz from the heart.


With his previous three films, "L.A. Confidential," "Wonder Boys" and "8 Mile," Curtis Hanson delivered a bracing surprise each time out, each one posing so distinctive and different a challenge. "In Her Shoes" is different, too, but the surprise this time is that he has made such a conventional picture, one that advances no out-of-the-ordinary ideas or feelings. While the director's avid fans may be disappointed, however, upscalish mainstream auds, particularly women, will eat up this well-acted, emotionally focused adaptation of Jennifer Weiner's popular novel about the falling-out and eventual reconciliation of two diametrically opposed sisters, auguring well for peppy B.O. through the fall upon Oct. 7 release.
The "chick lit" label has been derided both for feminist/political reasons and because such pigeon-holing has the appearance of ghettoizing the genre commercially and critically. But there's no escaping that a work centering upon young women who think about little other than their looks, weight and clothes and take hourly seismographic readings of the status of their relationships is going to be put in this category. Add to that a large cast of cute dogs and an acutely embarrassing bridal shower and "In Her Shoes" qualifies on all fronts.
So while for many guys it will take a woman they're really, really interested in to drag them to this sort of high class soap opera, women and more emotionally flexible men should have little trouble becoming involved in this tale of sisterly love/hate, at least once the initial half-hour of almost painfully direct exposition in Susannah Grant's screenplay is dispensed with.
Intercut opening scene of parallel sexcapades pointedly illustrates the differences between the Feller sisters. Rose (Toni Collette), a successful big-firm Philadelphia lawyer, sleeps with her boss and fantasizes the best possible result romantically and professionally. Sexier younger sis Maggie (Cameron Diaz) attends her 10th high school reunion and drunkenly throws up in a bathroom while getting it on with one of her old classmates.
Schematically, then, Rose is a bright, responsible, somewhat overweight woman who has so subordinated her personal life to her career that she can't imagine any man would be attracted to her, while Maggie is a full-time party girl who's always gotten by on her looks and utter availability.
When Maggie's latest round of ridiculous behavior gets her kicked out of the house by step-mother Sydelle (Candice Azzara), she has nowhere to crash but on Rose's couch. It's a stretch to accept that a nice, upper-middle-class Jewish girl would not only be such a social cretin but would be functionally illiterate to boot (Maggie's inability to read prevents her from getting an MTV DJ job), but Maggie has leeched off others all her life.
Despite the fact that she and Rose have been ultra-close since they lost their mother as little girls, Maggie thinks nothing of trashing her sister's apartment, rummaging through her personal effects and screwing her would-be boyfriend.
This last understandably gets her bounced out on the street, but not before she has discovered a cache of years-old holiday cards (with money enclosed) from a grandmother she long thought dead. So with nowhere else to turn, Maggie heads for Florida, where she finds the widowed Ella (Shirley MacLaine) living in a pleasant retirement community.
Pic takes a turn for the better at this point, as the two women gingerly feel one another out against the backdrop of a lively group of oldsters endowed with wry humor and only intermittently irritating levels of "Cocoon"-like cutes. Maggie and Ella are mutually incriminating at first, with the former issuing charges of abandonment and the latter explaining that she was pushed away from her granddaughters by their resentful father after his wife's death. Guilt piles up, truths are gradually revealed and the old men at the facility greatly enjoy the lissome, if uncommunicative, Maggie around the pool.
When Ella catches Maggie rifling through her valuables, Ella generously proposes to match her salary if Maggie will take a job at the assisted living center. It's there that Maggie is induced to practice reading with a courtly, now-blind professor (the inimitable Norman Lloyd), receiving from him the kind of personal interest and praise she evidently never received before.
Meanwhile, up in Philly, Rose's life has also improved. For sanity's sake, she's quit her high-powered job, getting great joy out her new profession of walking dogs, and having finally given in to persistent suitor Simon Stein (Mark Feuerstein) and become engaged. However, her inability to address the painful subject of her sister becomes so pronounced as to create a rift with Simon, finally inducing her to make a trip to Florida herself.
For better or worse, depending upon your point of view, it's the type of film in which an Elizabeth Bishop poem is used to illuminate and transform a character. For a Hanson film, it is notable both for its relatively lax sense of narrative momentum and its only modest degree of rigor. Helmer's customary smarts are mostly to be found in the scenes with MacLaine, whose performance unerringly conveys a lifetime's worth of emotional wisdom leavened by a healthy propensity for looking on the bright side. Pic gains a spine whenever she's around.
Collette also has a strong grasp of her character, and while Rose's dismayed reactions to the misfortunes that befall her is understandable, she tosses off her job rather easily, which begs some further clarification of her deepest motives.
Diaz is completely credible as a hot number in danger of becoming, in her sister's words, "a middle-aged tramp," but Maggie is a character completely lacking in self-awareness and Diaz provides no subtext for this. In the end, the Feller sisters are women defined by primary traits and remain unfleshed out by scripted subtleties and actorly grace notes.
Supporting turns, especially by the jovial bunch in Florida, are colorful, and craft contributions are sharp without being unduly polished. Mark Isham's score is too cloyingly cutesy by half.

In Adaptation , Charlie Kaufman  used sibling rivalry to illuminate The Orchid Thief 's larger questions of being. The wrangling between twin opposites teased at the ways human psychology and biology resonate with patterns in the natural world: evolution, symbiosis, growth, decay. The sustained joke hinged on the effects of desired and incidental cross-pollination. Curtis Hanson  didn't need to invent dueling sisters to get at the soul (sole?) of Jennifer Weiner 's chick lit In Her Shoes . They were right there for him: bubbly Maggie, the party-girl grifter and closet dyslexic who pilfers sis's petty cash and Jimmy Choos ; and frumpy Rose, the closet closet-freak lawyer who curates her Hold Everything shoe cubbies with no intention of stepping out. When sisterly acrimony escalates to betrayal, Maggie jets Philly for Miami, where time spent with their estranged grandmother resets her clock.

It's an interesting choice for Hanson, who, after guy-fueled flicks like Wonder Boys  and 8 Mile , tries doing his thing backwards and in heels. It almost works, too. Cameron Diaz  and Toni Collette , who seem just a touch old and a little too gorgeous for the roles of Maggie and Rose, are smart choices for this blend of slapstick and sentiment. Hanson's angles are fresh, his palettes pleasing. And though it might disappoint Manolo-holics, the decorporn is kept to a minimum.
But from the start, writer Susannah Grant  (Erin Brockovich  ) resorts to clunky exposition that strains the necessary belief that the sisters are twin-close. When they get a chance, Diaz and the always great Collette do right by their scripted tiffs and affections, but none of the banter conveys Adaptation 's familial mind-meld, or the visceral hate-love that oozes from the sibs in Arrested Development  . We crave more of the rapid slang and secret code that, by excluding us, creates intimacy.
That said, the Miami scenes verily glow, as grandma Ella's golden gal pals coax warm sitcom-laughs and a sunbathing Maggie shakes up the shuffleboard crew (and, goofily, overcomes her fear of reading with the help of Elizabeth Bishop  and an infirm ex-professoroy). The best moments belong to Shirley MacLaine , who makes the clipped script sing as Ella, carrier of dark family secrets. Ella looks at her granddaughters with exquisite pride and pain. And Diaz is at her muted best in MacLaine's presence, seemingly inspired by the redolent gravitas to drop her little-girl coo and reveal a new darkness at the edge of youth. It looks good on her.
