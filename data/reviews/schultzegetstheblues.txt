         Movies don't get much more minimal than "Schultze Gets the Blues," yet it clocks in at 114 minutes, which makes it a tough go because so little happens. Filmmaker Michael Schorr places a great deal of faith in the efficacy of drollness reduced to its driest tone, but "Schultze" is simply too tedious and stretched out to be amusing. Had Schorr brought in his picture at 80 or 90 minutes "Schultze" might have been a different story.
 
  Schultze (Horst Krause) and fellow salt miners Jürgen (Harald Warmbrunn) and Manfred (Karl-Fred Müller) are given early retirement, and they are at a loss as to what to do with their lives in their small town in the Sachsen-Anhalt region of Germany. Schultze's friends have wives, and at least the stocky, big-bellied Schultze has his accordion. One day, while station surfing on his radio, Schultze hears zydeco music for the first time, and at the 50th anniversary celebration of the local music club he unexpectedly segues from polka to zydeco. Eventually, Jürgen and Manfred launch a fundraising campaign to send Schultze to their sister city's annual music festival in Texas.
 


         






    More than an hour goes by before Schultze arrives in Texas, where he has a series of pleasant encounters, rents a motorboat to ply the Louisiana bayous and along the way hears lots of zydeco music — but even though Schultze has brought along his accordion Schorr denies us even the small pleasure of watching him playing along with the friendly Cajuns. The second half of the film works better than the first simply because there's a little more going on. Krause's Schultze seems sweet natured and thoughtful, but audiences don't really get a chance to know him. The film's soundtrack is available, and listening to it has to be more entertaining than struggling to stay awake for "Schultze Gets the Blues."

chultze Gets the Blues" rediscovers the world through the astonished eyes of a retired German salt miner on a musical pilgrimage to the United States. As the title character (Horst Krause) ambles around the Texas Gulf Coast and Louisiana bayou country, the screen drinks in the sultry, humid atmosphere. Puttering on the local waterways in a battered blue motorboat, using his few words of broken English to communicate, Schultze enjoys a late-life liberation that the movie pushes to the brink of sentimentality. Beer-bellied and taciturn, he is not the kind of tourist who takes aim at a strange location with a guidebook, camera and language tapes in hand. He is more like a benign visitor from another galaxy who has simply dropped out of the sky. The film's contemplation of the wonders of the everyday isn't limited to Schultze's American odyssey. The German director and screenwriter Michael Schorr, in his feature film debut, studies everything in sight from the same childlike perspective. The rituals of Schultze's drab provincial life look just as exotic (though much less pleasurable) as those in the "faraway places with strange-sounding names" (to quote an old Bing Crosby hit) that lure him abroad. As the movie begins, Schultze, who spent his life toiling in a salt mine, is reluctantly pushed into early retirement along with several other miners, including his best friends, J�rgen (Harald Warmbrunn) and Manfred (Karl-Fred M�ller). With nothing much to do, they while away their days drinking beer, fishing, playing cards and squabbling over chess. An amateur accordionist, Schultze belongs to a music club whose members meet regularly to perform the same antique chorales and polkas they have been recycling for decades. At home one afternoon, Schultze's ears perk up at the accordion sounds  of a Texan zydeco band on the radio. He picks up the tune on his instrument and soon becomes obsessed with it. Before long, he is experimenting in his kitchen with Cajun dishes, including a spicy jambalaya that he serves to his delighted friends. Asked to perform at the club's 50th-anniversary celebration, he decides,  after much debate, to play the zydeco tune instead of the expected polka. The performance has a mixed reception. Several stunned  members view his defection as cultural heresy. The club nevertheless decides to send him as its representative to a folk festival in Texas. Once there, he realizes he's musically far outclassed and spends the rest of his stay enjoying a vacation. Because it's a study of late-life angst, "Schultze Gets the Blues" has a distant affinity with the far more articulate "About Schmidt." It is closer in spirit to sweetly humanist cult films like "Bagdad Cafe" that enfold you in a big, reassuring bear hug. It's a good thing the movie has so little dialogue, because when it talks, the words dilute its almost surreal visual spell, and the fructose turns to saccharine. "Schultze Gets the Blues" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has nudity.

A disarmingly bittersweet comedy about a middle-aged polka accordionist who gets a new lease on life from his discovery of Cajun music, accomplished first-time writer-director Michael Schorr's "Schultze Gets the Blues" recalls the deadpan drollery and unglamorous working-class characters of Scandinavian directors like Aki Kaurismaki and Bent Hamer. While it feels overlong and loses energy in the midsection when the protagonist travels from Germany to Texas, this small but charming film has enough in its favor to land on the slates of niche distributors. Schorr won a special jury prize for direction in the Venice fest's Upstream competition.
The film starts in Ken Loach territory: Middle-aged Schultze (Horst Krause) and his buddies Jurgen (Harald Warmbrunn) and Manfred (Karl-Fred Muller) are nudged into early retirement after working the mines in small-town former East Germany. Life goes on for unmarried Schultze in a somewhat desultory fashion between his chronic cough, the beer hall, fishing excursions and the local folkmusic club, where his father was considered a giant among polka musicians.
When he hears a jaunty zydeco riff on the radio, Schultze is inspired to adopt a new accordion style, defying his family heritage and shocking the tradition-bound club members.
Despite his anxiety over change, Schultze feels invigorated by the new tune he's playing. He learns to cook jambalaya and takes temporary jobs to save for a trip to Louisiana. A sudden price hike puts the fare out of reach, but spurred by Jurgen and Manfred, the music club sends Schultze as its representative to compete in a Texas folk fest.
The comedy loses steam briefly as Schultze is taken out of his natural environment. But the film reasserts itself in unpredictable ways, regaining momentum and a flavorful, liberated mood as -- with no acquaintances and virtually no English -- the German discovers a spirit of adventure.
Backing out of the music event when he sees the intimidating level of competition, Schultze acquires a humble motorboat and begins an untroubled journey through the backwaters and bayous of Texas and Louisiana, punctuated by odd encounters, that leads to a poignant conclusion.
Schorr's skill as a visual storyteller and humorist is considerable. With very little camera movement throughout the film, he sets up static shots with a keen compositional sense, a pleasing grasp of narrative economy and a deft eye for amusing detail.
This is a warm-hearted movie with real affection for its eccentric characters, particularly rotund Schultze, delightfully played by Krause with a beaming grin and only a sprinkling of dialogue.

What hints at a wacky one-note polkastaid, retired German miner and accordion hobbyist upends his life upon hearing zydecoends up an intricate, becalmed take on a soul adrift. Something of an anti-heimatfilm , Schultze Gets the Blues  gently loathes the German mining town in which the first half is set. Like the title character (Horst Krause , stout and smiling), the movie is bewitched by the myriad ways out: a friendly French dowager, a flamenco-happy barmaid, and finally, after Schultze rubs Oktoberfesters wrong with a Cajun tune, a ticket to represent the community in its Texas sister city. The crummy, prefab industrial landscapes give way to (seemingly timeless) shotgun shacks, crab boats, and juke joints. Schultze, a gigantic gentlemanly slab doffing his hat to everyone, becomes a lost-in-America cousin to Jack Nicholson 's Schmidt, finding himself quashed by the strangeness of it all. The overplayed architectural contrasts (Schultze never sees America's own industrial wastelands) are understandable, given the hero's innocence and director Michael Schorr 's willingness to meander along with him. There's no hoo-ha about the magic of music herejust a little tune that Schultze never quite learns, that never quite fits into his life.
