The Last House on the Left
 meets Psycho
 in this stylistically thrilling but ultimately tedious French import, dubbed and recut for an Americanized R-rating. Aja has recently been tagged to helm the remake of Wes Craven's giddy take on the Sawney Bean cannibal family, The Hills Have Eyes
, and watching High Tension
 it's easy to see why. He directs from the gut, in more ways than the obvious, and this gruesome, hyper-violent tale of rural stalkings and nameless dread plays like early Craven minus the warped social commentary. De France plays Marie, a young Parisian who travels to the countryside with girlfriend Alex (Le Besco) on holiday only to find herself the fancy of a truck-driving maniac (Nahon) with a penchant for creatively murderous acts. You'd think the dubbing would get in the way of the story, but there's so little dialogue (and so little story) that it hardly registers. Despite that, or perhaps because of it, Aja's film is a minor masterpiece of cutting, edited within an inch of its life and genuinely disturbing at times. It's also saddled with one of the most annoying third-act reversals of misfortune yet seen on film, and one that makes its forebears (Hitchcock, De Palma) seem all the more genius by comparison. For horror fans, though, it's a blast, chock-full of mangled bodies and enough blue and red gels to light a Dario Argento film. Aja's horrific set-pieces, including a highly creative death-by-armoire and the best use of a two-by-four since Buford Pusser walked tall, are drenched in the kind of surreal, overwrought style that defined Euro-horror in the Eighties. The director clearly knows the field, and High Tension
 is a gripping piece of splatterpunk, despite the fact that there's not much to it. De France, with her shorn locks and sweaty, manic physique, plays to the story's middling strengths, mainly running around and watching people die in clever ways until it's time to off someone in similarly imaginative fashion; she's like Jean Seberg on a crystal-meth bender. Much has been made of this film's violence, and while the Lions Gate version in current release has been cut, the vast majority of Aja's intended gore remains gleefully intact. High Tension
 may have something to say about repressed urban blondes, but the message, if there is one, chokes on a mouthful of the red stuff and gets lost on the way to the grave. That's probably for the best. Shockers of this crimson stripe don't necessitate subtext, although as Wes Craven surely knows, it never hurts to have one.


It's a credit, albeit a minor one, to Alexandre Aja's horror thriller ''High Tension" that its heroine doesn't wake up screaming in the last shot, because for over an hour the picture feels like a grisly nightmare.
''High Tension" is from France, and it has a distinctly European sense of dread. It doesn't bother with the who or the why, just the what and the how ghastly. Come the film's dumb and insulting last-minute revelation, there's every reason to think it should have bothered trying to explain something
. Alas, no. The film ends, inexplicably, with a shrug.
Aja and co-writer Gregory Levasseur cough up a story in which Marie and Alex (Cécile De France and Maïwenn), two law students, drive to Alex's parents' country house. Marie is a tough-looking girl with a punky blond haircut, and she obviously has a crush on the ostensibly straight Alex.
During the car ride, she chastises her friend for ditching her recently to talk to a boy. And, later that evening, she demurs when Alex presses her about her own love life. That night, after Marie has a gotten an eyeful of Alex in the shower, there's a knock on the door, which Alex's father is foolish enough to answer. The poor guy is promptly stabbed and decapitated. Alex's mother is garroted as Marie watches, ''Blue Velvet"-style, though the slats of the bedroom closet. Alex's little brother, the kid in the unfortunate cowboy costume, is shot in the cornfield.
Alex herself is tied up, thrown in a van, and left in one piece, presumably for a pending sexual adventure, and because there's still 70 minutes of movie to go.
The culprit is an old beast in overalls and a cap, with a fondness for running his straight razor ominously along bloody skin. Effectively, he is the bogeyman in ''High Tension."
Anyone familiar with Gaspar Noé's ''I Stand Alone" might recognize the fellow's ruddy complexion, devilish grunt, and cauldron-sized belly -- they belong to Philippe Nahon. In Noé's psychological terror flick, another exercise in awfulness, he played a meat-monger with a ghastly interest in young ladies. Here, he's a different (but not that different) sort of butcher.
''High Tension" is being released by Lion's Gate, which also put out last year's stomach-turning ''Saw." The studio has become quite the grind house -- a home for filmmakers who want not only to sicken, but also to provoke.
Hence the juxtaposition of the killer's arrival with a scene of Marie masturbating. Later, when he binds, gags, and absconds with Alex in his rusty van, Marie steels for her own brand of sadism. Indeed, she winds up trailing them in a GTO whose bumblebee paint job perfectly matches Uma Thurman's ''Kill Bill" racer's suit, right down to the black stripe.
From here the movie seems poised to evolve into a cathartic revenge plot. You don't care about the characters, per se. You just want justice, and once Marie gets her hand on a piece of wood wrapped in barbed wire, the movie is talking to the sick freak in some of us.
But ''High Tension" is a fraud. It doesn't make an iota of sense. (Neither does the decision to dub a third of the movie, and subtitle the rest.) By the end, Aja and Levasseur are making an equation between sexual attraction and homicidal mania that turns standard horror movie craziness upside down.
What happens in the final minutes is narratively dumb -- and psychosexually ridiculous.
That's a shame. Aja knows his way around a suspenseful sequence, which a lot of the directors toiling in this genre don't. But the horrible anticipation he builds is derailed by a gimmick that makes the twist in, say, ''Fight Club" seem perfectly logical. To say more would be to ruin the movie, and why should I do that when its own makers have done it for you?

         An ode to the oral tradition of the Middle East, "The Keeper: The Legend of Omar Khayyam" is efficiently told by first-time writer-director Kayvan Mashayekh and melds the contemporary world with the historic. The family-friendly epic weaves the touching story of a young boy living with his Iranian immigrant family in Houston and the tale of the 11th century mathematician, astronomer and poet, Omar Khayyam.
 
  The boy, Kamran (Adam Echahly), sits patiently by the bedside of his dying older brother Nader (Puya Behinaein) who carefully relates the adventures of Khayyam as their grandfather and his ancestors had done before him. Omar (Bruno Lastra) is a brilliant young man involved in a "Jules and Jim"-like triangle with the beautiful slave girl Darya (Marie Espinosa) and the fiercely devout Hassan Sabbeh (Christopher Simpson), who goes on to create the sect of the Assassins. Called to work in the court of the Sultan Malikshah (Moritz Bliebtreu), Omar becomes one of the great minds of his age as he struggles to remain above the political and religious upheaval. Inspired by the tale, Kamran is propelled on a quest to discover more about the author of the Rubiayat.
 


         






    Shot primarily in Uzbekistan, the film boasts strong production values and an international cast that includes Vanessa Redgrave and Diane Baker. There is nothing extraordinary about the filmmaking, but Mashayekh's old-fashioned commitment to his and co-writer Belle Avery's story creates an overall satisfying experience.

 A bloodbath that twists expectations
 
 
Alexandre Aja's "High Tension" is an efficiently made French thriller — extensively dubbed for accessibility and aimed at audiences with a taste for films of extreme violence. The MPAA has given a trimmed version of this grisly bloodbath an R rating, but it still raises the question: When it comes to the depiction of graphic grisliness and gore, for what is the MPAA saving the NC-17? For much of its duration the film is a case of intense fare done with an undeniable effectiveness and ingenuity — until it lurches into a deplorable surprise twist. (What that is will not be revealed here.)
 
  The film follows a savage, burly, middle-aged madman (Philippe Nahon, of Gaspar Noe's "I Stand Alone") who slaughters a husband and wife and small child in their rural home in the south of France and kidnaps their teenage daughter Alex (Maïwenn). Marie (Cécile de France), a visiting friend and classmate, bravely attempts to rescue Alex from the killer's clutches. But things are not what they seem. The killer turns out to be a stereotype that is no less offensive because it is the stalest of cliches.
 
 "High Tension," 
(1 hour, 25 minutes) Rated R, for graphic bloody killings, terror, sexual content and language. In general release.
 
 Bowling is back with a big heart
 
 
In his engaging documentary "A League of Ordinary Gentlemen" Christopher Browne makes bowling exciting and its stars involving as he follows the 2003 Professional Bowlers Assn. nationwide tour, culminating in a tense world championship showdown in Detroit. By 1997, when ABC stopped televising the PBA competitions, professional bowling was nearly extinct and bowling itself long past its peak popularity as a family pastime. However, in 2000, three former Microsoft executives purchased the PBA for $5 million, and hired Chief Executive Officer Steve Miller, a smart, blunt ex-football player and former Nike global marketing head to revive the PBA by making it more colorful and media friendly.
 
  Miller is a tough guy with a clutch of right ideas, which even the film's four professional bowling subjects acknowledge, albeit grudgingly. The flamboyant style of pugnacious, wiry Pete Weber is exactly to Miller's taste, but the others are not so neat a fit. Walter Ray Williams Jr. is a tall, imposing man with a low-key style and manner; Chris Barnes is a talented, clean-cut young man given to mood swings; and Wayne Webb, like Weber and Williams, is a middle-age veteran — but unlike them he has a past strewn with broken marriages and bankruptcies; this tour will make or break his career as a professional bowler. Circumstances have forced Webb to reflect more deeply upon his life than the others, and he becomes the heart of this informativeand endearing film.

 Ex-con must pick up life's leftovers
 
 
Filmmaker Ray McKinnon, an Academy Award winner for best live action short in 2002, makes a stirring feature directing debut with the Southern gothic drama "Chrystal." Billy Bob Thornton plays Joe, a former pot farmer, returning home after 20 years in prison, the consequence of a car accident during police pursuit on drug charges that left his young son dead and his wife, Chrystal, (Lisa Blount) maimed — physically and emotionally.
 
  Thornton and Blount are excellent, wearing frozen masks of hurt as they do a slow dance of redemption. McKinnon adds some comic sadism playing a local drug lord named Snake, and Stephen Trask's original music and the roots-oriented song score compliment the rusted out surroundings of the Ozark mountain town where the film takes place. "Chrystal" unravels a bit toward the end as it becomes more fable-like, but the performances make it worthwhile.
 
 "Chrystal," 
R for sexuality, nudity, drug content, violence and language. Running time: 1 hour, 46 minutes. Exclusively at Laemmle's Sunset 5, 8000 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (323) 848-3500.
 
 One man's inner revolution
 
 
Karen Shakhnazarov's handsome "The Rider Named Death" is not the film one might have expected from an adaptation of a 1909 novel by Boris Savinkov (1879-1925), who became a leader of the Combat Organization, the terrorist faction of Russia's Socialist-Revolutionary Party, whose bombings and assassinations of high government officials in the early 20th century paved the way for the Russian Revolution.
 
  Shakhnazarov eschews suspense, passion and intrigue for a highly contemplative portrait of a reflective, coldly detached man, Georges (Andrey Panin), clearly Savinkov's alter ego, who in the course of the film acknowledges that though he may kill for an idea or a principle, his fundamental motive is that he simply wants to. He has come to see civilization as a sham and to regard people as savages driven by a desire for revenge. This means that "The Rider Named Death" is so low-key as to skirt tedium but does subtly manage to accrue a certain cumulative effect.
 
  "The Rider Named Death" takes place mostly on a large set re-creating a section of Moscow at the turn of the last century, which means much of the action is confined to the same settings, creating an unfortunate repetitiveness. The force of the film is not as profound as Shakhnazarov clearly intended, and "The Rider Named Death" is easier to respect than enjoy.
 
 "The Rider Named Death,"
 unrated. Some violence, adult scenes. 1 hour, 46 minutes. At the New Beverly Cinema, 7165 W. Beverly Blvd.   

To steal a bit from Real Time With Bill Maher , here's a New Rule: No more Chainsaw  rip-offs. Enough already  we get it. If you're a sexed-up young thing taking a road trip into the country, beware of the creepy backwoods farm guy! He's going to bind you in a room or stow you in his decrepit old rustmobile and attack you with an appliance. And don't even think of asking the convenience-store clerk for help  he'll turn out to be buddies with the backwoods creep. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , while a great horror film, has spawned an entire genre of slice-and-dice redneck Guignol that no longer holds a whisper of dread or surprise. In the French thriller High Tension , which is the latest reshuffling of Chainsaw  tropes, the victims are two young women stuck in a country house with a big, fat, grunting brute who's got a thing for decapitation. (The one scary moment: A barely attached head talks.) There's a laughable cheat of a Big Twist, in which the sicko and the girl who looks like Lori Petty turn out to be closer than you thought, but even a blood feast this squalid can't get away with chain-sawing all logic.

Americans are a bloodthirsty lot, at least on the big screen. The recent Hollywood rage for redoing the best and often worst from the annals of horror has wrought remakes of "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre," "Dawn of the Dead," "The Amityville Horror" and various and sundry Asian films. Oozing into a theater near you soon will be remakes of "The Evil Dead," "The Wicker Man" and Wes Craven's "Hills Have Eyes," an atrocity exhibition (family + cannibals = trouble) that is being directed by the 26-year-old French filmmaker Alexandre Aja. We may not need another iteration of a story about psychos chowing down on human viscera, but need has nothing to do with what we want, and it's clear from box-office tallies that what we really want is to be scared - to throw our hands over our eyes, peek through our latticed fingers and whimper like dogs.  And because the original "Hills Have Eyes" is freaking creepy,  and because Mr. Aja has clearly made a dissertation-level study of classic American horror, specifically 1970's-era slasher flicks, it seems likely that he will keep audiences jumping with his remake. Meanwhile, you can test your reflexes by taking in his second feature, "High Tension," a horror movie he wrote with Grégory Levasseur that was released in France in 2003. By turns unnerving and numbing, "High Tension" opens with two young women, Marie (Cécile de France, who looks a bit like one of the acting Arquettes) and Alex (Maïwenn, who can look rather remarkably like Steven Tyler), driving on an emptied-out highway. On a study break from college, the women are somewhere in France en route to the farmhouse home of Alex's parents. Right from the get-go, something feels off, partly because it appears that a neutron bomb has done away with the rest of the world, partly because the women's lips don't match the audio. Having decided that horror fans don't pay much mind to, you know, words, the company releasing the film in the United States decided to use subtitles sparingly and dub most of the dialogue. Until the blood starts flowing, the dubbing creates an unfortunate distraction. The English dialogue has that slightly hollow sound you get with dubbed films, and after you notice the disconnect between sight and sound, you watch the women's mouths like a lip-reader. But once Marie and Alex drive down a road that cuts through a cornfield, you relax. Because outside of "Oklahoma!," cornfields herald very bad things, whether in that hair-raising "Twilight Zone" episode with Billy Mumy, or in the movies "Children of the Corn" and "Jeepers Creepers 2," and it isn't long before something wicked this way comes. Sure enough, doors are soon squeaking, and a stranger (Philippe Nahon, the slab of beef from the French cult films "I Stand Alone" and "Irréversible") is frolicking with a decapitated head next to the cornfields. What follows is a protracted, enthusiastically gory variation of cat-and-mouse in which a villain with a ravenous appetite for destruction plucks off one victim after another. One unfortunate is decapitated with a chest of drawers (don't ask); another is all but beheaded with a straight-edge razor. Mr. Aja presents these deaths with heart-thumping, gruesome verisimilitude; unfortunately, he also stages the shotgun murder of a small child, a decadent and unnecessary flourish. To an extent, the return to such extreme horror is a natural consequence of  the "Scream" movies, which turned decades of genre clichés into self-conscious irony, and of that franchise's parodies. After coaxing out so many laughs, both nervous and mocking, horror had to repackage itself if it was going to remain commercially and creatively viable. For those horror movies that don't recycle Asian material, the repackaging has often involved a return to the 1970's and early 80's, if not always to the actual era, then certainly in vibe and instrumentality. Like the fairly recent "Cabin Fever" and like earlier slasher films of that grisly ilk, "High Tension" takes a fairly straightforward approach to its essential reason for being, namely the stagecraft of death. There are all sorts of reasons we love horror films, including the fact that they get into our bodies - these are movies that literally move us. But watching Marie and Alex go through their paces in "High Tension" is to be reminded once more that at the heart of  horror is the spectacle of pain, and that the pleasure we take in that spectacle is often more unsettling than anything in the actual movie, this one included. "High Tension" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It features extreme violence via furniture, a razor, an ax, a chain saw, a knife and something that looks a lot like a corkscrew.

A proudly violent, women-in-peril slasher pic, "Switchblade Romance" represents a lateral move for 24-year-old French helmer Alexandre Aja after his hauntingly sinister debut "Furia." "Switchblade" deftly juggles gore and suspense, and punchline holds an intellectual frisson or two for fans of gender-role speculation, but basically this is one more horror pic on the distinguished road already trodden by "Texas Chain Saw Massacre," "Maniac" and the like. Blood-soaked widescreen romp got the relatively rare "16-and-over" rating in Gaul when it launched June 18. Horror-fest and latenight programmers, plus ancillary scouts, should check this one out.
In order to study for their exams in peace, fetching college students Alex (Maiwenn) and Marie (Cecile de France) drive to an isolated farmhouse where Alex's mom, dad and baby brother Tommy live. Their conversation reveals Alex is enjoying a fling with a married man, but Marie is too picky to sleep around.
While the girls settle in at the farm, the audience is introduced to a stocky middle-aged man receiving oral sex in his beat-up truck. When he tosses a young woman's severed head out the window soon afterwards and drives off chuckling, it's clear no one in their right mind should answer the door if this guy were to ring the bell.
Alas, Alex's dad does just that in the middle of the night. As a result, he's soon minus his
 head, which the intruder shears off with a piece of furniture. When mom and little Tommy have been dispatched, the Killer (Philippe Nahon) tosses a brutalized, gagged and chained Alex into his truck and hits the road.
Unknown to him, Marie has managed to climb aboard. Straight razor, hatchet and chainsaw subsequently connect with flesh as Marie attempts to rescue her immobilized friend from the psycho.
The versatile De France, who picked up a Cesar award for her turn as the lesbian housemate in "L'auberge espagnole" ("Europudding"/"The Spanish Apartment") makes a tough, resourceful heroine, but Ripley in "Alien" she ain't. For the record, mono-monikered thesp Maiwenn is the elder sister of actress Isolde Le Besco.
Unnerving sound design ups the creepiness ante. Lensed in Romania, pic has a sinister, hemoglobin look that fits the story like a glove.

The international shortage of horror movie plots surfaces in France with Alexandre Aja 's High Tension , a pastiche of '70s American slasher flicks that seemingly stands to add to the worldwide glut of irono-nostalgic sequels, remakes, and retreads. Happily, though, High Tension  is a gratifyingly gory, doggedly intellectual decon of the likes of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre , Halloween , and (surprisingly but aptly) Duel  that managesbefore faltering under the weight of its own pretensionsto be pretty scary.
The broad strokes are familiar enough: Attractive, sassy college student Marie (Cécile de France) accompanies gal pal Alex (Maïwenn) for a weekend of studying at the latter's remote family farmhouse. Shortly after settling in, they're besieged by a grunting, giggling homicidal automaton (Philippe Nahon ) who summarily snuffs Alex's relations as Marie cannily evades his notice. Her watchful inaction in these early scenes indicates that High Tension  is up to something more than mere mimicry; placing the Carol Clover-ian "final girl" in the voyeur role instead of the killer is a telling instance of genre-bending. Such details become even more crucial when Marie pursues the brute after he abducts Alex and ultimately confronts him with one of the more uproariously lethal of the film's abundant phallic symbols.
The truth of the situation is exposed shortly afterward in a twist that lets the air out of the movie, but the revelation is both inevitable and exceedingly cleverif also backhandedly puritanical. Such deficits are easy to overlook thanks to High Tension 's knowing performances and unnerving combination of ambient sound, fluidly jittery cutting, and sly widescreen setups. It's enough to give horror fans reason to anticipate Aja's next projecta (sigh) remake of The Hills Have Eyes .
