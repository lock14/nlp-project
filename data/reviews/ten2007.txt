"The Ten" has a catchy concept: 10 short satiric stories, each focusing on one of the Ten Commandments. It has a high-profile young cast: Paul Rudd, Winona Ryder, Gretchen Mol, Jessica Alba, and Liev Schreiber are among the glamorous talents herein assembled.
All that's missing are the laughs. Any laughs. Co-written and directed by David Wain, a member of the putative comedy troupe Stella and director of the actually quite funny "Wet Hot American Summer" (2001), "The Ten" is a virtually snicker-free exercise in audience pain. It's less a movie than an endurance test.
The problem lies in the approach: Each commandment is "illustrated" by an absurdist comic situation that relates to it only tangentially before going further off the rails. "Thou Shalt Have No Other Gods Before Me" concerns a young man (Adam Brody) who becomes a celebrity after a sky-diving accident leaves him forever embedded in the ground; the sequence falls apart into sub-Python newscaster bickering.
"Thou Shalt Not Murder" features a slick surgeon (co-writer Ken Marino) who leaves medical instruments inside a patient "as a goof," and that's pretty much the joke. "Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbor's Goods" is about a contest between two suburbanites (Schreiber and Joe Lo Truglio) to see who can amass the most CAT-scan machines. "Thou Shalt Not Covet Thy Neighbor's Wife" is a thwarted prison romance between the jailed surgeon and a fellow inmate (Rob Corddry of "The Daily Show").
The only segments that force a smile are "Thou Shalt Not Take the Lord's Name in Vain," in which a virginal librarian (Mol) meets and falls for a hunky, shirtless Jesus Christ (Justin Theroux) during a Mexican vacation, and "Thou Shalt Not Steal," which gives Ryder an outrageously athletic sex scene with a ventriloquist's dummy. They're as smug and airless as the rest, but at least they're allowed to expand on their premises before the ADD filmmaking turns helplessly elsewhere.
Linking these skits is an even less funny story line involving a boorish narrator (Rudd) torn between his beautiful shrew of a wife (Famke Janssen) and clingy mistress (Alba). The stale fear-of-women humor might be bearable if the script weren't so relentlessly witless. "Do you know what 'The Ten' is?" asks Rudd rhetorically at one point, before continuing, " 'Ten'-is? Tennis? Tennis, anyone?"
Anyone and anything but this.


         David Wain, director of "Wet Hot American Summer," creator of the sketch comedy series "The State" and founding member of the improv troupe Stella, brings his popular brand of surrealist yet mundane humor to the big screen with more or less dreadful results.
 
 A collection of short films based on the Ten Commandments, "The Ten" is presented by Paul Rudd as a narrator character who lives in a black void with a pair of gigantic stone tablets lurking in the background. His marriage (Famke Janssen plays his wife) is falling apart, mostly due to an affair with Jessica Alba's character. The amazing cast -- which includes, among others, Liev Schreiber, Winona Ryder, Rob Corddry, Janeane (for, like, a nanosecond) Garofalo, Oliver Platt, Justin Theroux, Gretchen Mol and why go on? -- is parceled out among 10 increasingly silly shorts, including one about a man who jumps from a plane without his parachute and lives the rest of his life impaled in the ground, a woman who leaves her fiancé for a ventriloquist's dummy and two neighbors who compete to see who can buy the most CAT-scan machines.
 


         






    The best film, based on not taking the Lord's name in vain, stars Theroux as a carpenter in a small Mexican village who happens to be not just any Jesús but the actual Jesus Christ, and who has a torrid affair with Mol, a librarian on vacation. Narrated in a deadpan documentary style by a Spanish-speaking commentator and subtitled in English, it's a very funny sendup of sundry sacred cows and taboos.
 
 Despite many giddy moments (and an extremely committed and very funny performance by Ryder), the conceit becomes gradually more exhausting, until somewhere around the seventh commandment you're ready to choose God's wrath over any more overproduced, A-list-acted throwaway TV sketches.
 
 
 "The Ten." MPAA Rating: R for pervasive strong crude sexual content including dialogue and nudity, and for language and some drug material. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes. In selected theaters.   

 With “The Ten,” David Wain uses the Ten Commandments the way a suicide uses a bridge. Stringing together a series of stone-tablet-based short films — from the gross to the surreal to the certifiably nuts — Mr. Wain, the writer and director of “Wet Hot American Summer,” repeats his strategy of aiming low and trusting in the higher power of genitalia.  Framed by Paul Rudd in the dual role of narrator and adulterer, the vignettes refer to their divine source, and one another, only tenuously. More drawn to the profane than to the sacred, Mr. Wain and his co-writer, Ken Marino, achieve periodic comic transcendence; a segment in which a virginal librarian (Gretchen Mol) finally gets it on with a Fabio-styled Mexican carpenter named Jesus (a marvelously deadpan Justin Theroux) would extract a smile from the pope himself.  A “Decalogue” for special-ed students, “The Ten” leans too often toward the bizarre and the bewildering. And though rough sex is a recurring motif, the movie’s overall tone is less blasphemous than raunchy. Illustrating this with all the commitment of Meryl Streep in “Sophie’s Choice,” a possessed Winona Ryder stalks, steals and sweatily seduces a compliant ventriloquist’s dummy. As her segment is illustrating “Thou shalt not steal,” her enthusiasm is doubly commendable. JEANNETTE  CATSOULIS  “The Ten” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has prison sex, animated sex and the kind of close-ups normally reserved for medical professionals.

A crazy-quilt of semi-interwoven sketches inspired by those tablets Moses brought down from the mountain, "The Ten" is anything but a morally corrective night out. Second feature from duo David Wain and Ken Marino of comedy group the State is, like their "Wet Hot American Summer," uneven but often hilarious. Bad-taste quotient is cranked up here, ditto the overall conceptual giddiness. Since ye olden days of "Kentucky Fried Movie" this sort of sketch omnibus has usually been more a cult than mainstream commercial attraction, but likely modest theatrical life should precede a long career in ancillary.
Only Christians with a very liberal sense of humor are likely to enjoy "The Ten." Even lay viewers will need to be tolerant of gags as envelope-pushing as anything in "Borat."
That said, "The Ten" doesn't go out of its way to blaspheme or otherwise poke fun at religion; it's simply that nothing is sacred, and the tastelessness is almost always funny first and nasty second -- which is more than can be said for most mainstream comedies.
Seemingly stream-of-consciousness, a la "Hellzapoppin'" and Monty Python, pic packs a near-surreal mix of outrageousness and deadpan, expertly packaged by director Wain.
Framing device has Paul Rudd (riffing pricelessly) as our host on a black soundstage with giant tablets bearing the Commandments. He introduces each ordered segment, but is continually sidetracked by, among other things, his floundering relationship with girlfriends (Famke Janssen, Jessica Alba).
The vignettes sprawl unpredictably. In the first ("Thou shalt have no other god before me"), Stephen (Adam Brody) goes skydiving with fiancee Kelly (Winona Ryder) -- but neglects to wear his parachute. He ends up grotesquely planted waist-deep in a field, and will not survive being extricated. His plight attracts national attention, a quasi-religious following, copycat jumpers, even a network sitcom.
Subsequent bits also use the commandments as the barest pretext for perverse scenarios that are morally ambivalent -- or just morally oblivious. Virginal 35-year-old librarian Gloria (Gretchen Mol) finally has the torrid time of her dreams during a Mexican vacation, with a swarthy handyman named Jesus (Justin Theroux). An incredibly arrogant surgeon (Marino) who plays a fatal prank on a patient can't believe he's actually sent to prison since it was "just a goof." Later on (in perhaps the most conceptually challenging seg) the surgeon's story continues in prison as a tale of brutal sexual abuse told in the pop-psych tones of soap opera
Bizarre conceit for "Honor Thy Mother and Father" has dark-skinned young twins (Cedric Sanders, Arlen Escarpeta) begging suburban WASP mom (Kerri Kenney-Silver) to reveal their real father's identity.
"The Ten" also includes cartoon "The Lying Rhino," a fable related among crackheads. Delightfully animated by Aaron Augenblick, it is, like so much else here, extremely rude, invigoratingly arbitrary, and awfully funny.
Chock full of admired but not quite A-list talent, "The Ten" looks and acts like it called in a lot of happily granted favors. All production values are smooth enough to belie the purported $5.25 mil budget, from crowd scenes to soundtracked songs. Thesps all seem to be richly enjoying themselves, without getting too broad or wink-wink about it. In particular Ryder, who hasn't had an easy professional or public time of late, seems to be letting off joyful steam in a vignette in which she finds true love on her wedding night not with the groom, but rather with something not exactly human, animal or even animate.

It's impossible to write about David Wain 's The Ten  without first making passing reference to Krzysztof Kieslowski 's Dekalog  and Monty Python 's The Meaning of Life . The former, originally made for Polish TV 20 years ago and first shown in the United States in 2000, offered a modern-day take on the Ten Commandments, interpreting each within the confines of a Warsaw  apartment complex, with guilt and tragedy the driving forces behind the director's beseeching meditation on God's Rules of Order. The latter, of course, found the English comedy troupe bidding adieu with fierce and occasionally grotesque bluster (care for a mint?). Never had their comedyhere sliced into vignettes and infused with a disdain for religiosity always hinted at but never before made so obviousseemed so ugly and angry (despite some catchy tunes).
The Ten , obsessed with prison rape and puppet dicks, doesn't exactly possess the grand ambitions of Kieslowski's work; nor does it seethe with the ham-fisted (albeit melodic) fury of the Pythons' finale. It's from the guys who brought you Wet Hot American   Summer , a film whose sole ambition was to remake Meatballs , and it's just a star-studded "goof," in the parlance of co-writer/co-star Ken Marino 's surgeon, who's keen on leaving instruments inside his patients' bodies because it makes him giggle. (He's the "Thou shalt not kill" commandment, natch.) More often than not, you'll laugh, and that's all you can hope for in what might as well be a prolonged episode of The State , from which several of the cast and creators sprang.
Featuring recurring characters who glide in and out of the sketches, The Ten 's biggest letdown are the interstitial sequences featuring Paul Rudd , usually the best thing about some of the worst movies. Rudd acts as the film's narrator, only he keeps getting interrupted by his nagging wife (Famke Janssen ) and his girlfriend (Jessica Alba ), who, for some reason, wants a pony. Their love triangle overwhelms and ultimately deflates the movie, halting whatever momentum builds from sketch to sketch. Nothing gets in the way of a good prison-rape joke like romantic comedy.
