Playtime is over.
There's no Quidditch match in the new "Harry Potter" movie. Even if there were, I don't think anybody would show up. Nor are there many of the huge computer-generated showcase scenes that don't advance the plot but exist solely for our summer-movie dazzlement. Darker, leaner, less expansive , and meaner, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix " is all business, and it casts a spell utterly unlike the first four films.
But it still casts a spell. Like it or not -- and the characters don't seem terribly happy about it -- this series is growing up with moody blockbuster urgency. More emotionally wracked with each new entry, the "Potter" franchise has become a mainstream fantasy metaphor for adolescent crisis. It's "Rebel Without a Curse."
For the three of you who haven't read the book (that makes four of us), "Phoenix" finds Hogwarts and the entire wizard world in a tizzy. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe ) successfully confronted Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes , sans nose) at the end of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire ," but the trouble is that precious few believe him, least of all Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy , looking very much like the Neville Chamberlain of this fictional universe ).
Fudge is convinced that Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon ) is raising a student army to overthrow him, and he installs a Ministry representative at the Academy. Her name is Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton ), and she is a horror.
The genetic offspring of Margaret Thatcher and Attila the Hun , Umbridge dresses in pink and is always smiling, even when she's tormenting a student with a magic quill that carves "I will not tell lies" into his skin. She collects commemorative plates with kittens on them (they mew plaintively in the background as she doles out the punishments). Driven to smoke out traitors, she instigates a witch hunt -- an irony that sails right over her head. She's every sadistic, self-righteous teacher you've ever hated, and Staunton puts the movie in her purse and struts off with it.
Urged on by his godfather, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman ), and other members of the title secret society -- Voldemort fighters of Harry's parents' generation -- the students band together to teach themselves magic on the sly, vowing to protect their headmaster in the inevitable showdown. (They're like kids putting on a show, only the balance of the universe is at stake.) "Phoenix" takes place almost entirely in the shadowy corridors of Hogwarts, rarely venturing outside to breathe the air, but it uses that visual oppressiveness to build a dogged sense of duty. If the movie's not much fun, it's because there simply isn't time.
For one thing, Voldemort is busy burrowing into the hero's mind, or perhaps that's just the evil side of Harry coming out. "I feel so angry
 all the time," he despairs, and Radcliffe's a good enough actor to blur the line between external stress and internal hormones.
Elsewhere the movie advances the entangled narratives of its young characters as best it can. Emma Watson's Hermione and Rupert Grint's Ron take a relative back seat to Harry's identity crisis this time out, but the gawkily heroic Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis ) comes further into his own, and the prankish Weasley twins (James and Oliver Phelps ) get more screen-time than ever (they're the only enjoyment the movie allows itself to have).
I wish I could say Harry's romance with classmate Cho Chang (Katie Leung ) carried a punch, but the character's a drip and a dramatic non-starter, here only so the hero can have his first kiss. ("It was wet," Harry reports. "Well, Cho's been crying a lot lately," says Hermione.) Much more interesting is a spooky new girl named Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch ), who sees things that may or may not be there: She's like Dakota Fanning after a few conks on the head, and I hope we get more of her.
The adult characters, by comparison, are lost in the shuffle that comes with compressing an 800-page novel into a two-hour-plus movie. All "Potter" movies are acts of literary triage, but this one more than most: Shuffling in and out are Robbie Coltrane's Hagrid , Emma Thompson's Professor Trelawney , Maggie Smith's Minerva McGonagall , Brendan Gleeson's Mad-Eye Moody , David Thewlis' Lupin -- half the actors in England, it seems.
With the villainous new character of Bellatrix Lestrange -- a Voldemort minion escaped from Azkaban Prison -- you feel the loss, since Helena Bonham Carter plays her with deliciously scary Goth relish. (The same goes for Natalia Tena's sexy, shape-shifting Nymphadora Tonks ; she's here and gone.) On the plus side, Gambon as Dumbledore and Alan Rickman as Severus Snape are more present than ever, and we learn a bit about Snape that deepens him in satisfying ways while tarnishing the memory of Harry's beloved dad. Idols don't fall in "Phoenix," but they do totter alarmingly.
The director is David Yates , a little-known British TV veteran who represents a change-up from the marquee names of previous installments. He's best known for "The Girl in the Cafe , " a muted two-character romantic drama that aired on HBO and was as far from a $150 million multiplex mega-toy as it's possible to get.
The choice turns out to have been inspired. As the "Potter" movies turn more interior and the CGI trickery becomes more reflective of the characters' emotional states, a director who knows how to navigate the nuances is invaluable. Most filmmakers can move traffic; fewer know how to move audiences. Yates still needs to work on the former -- some of the transitions in "Phoenix" are painfully awkward -- but he has already mastered the latter. (Even so, the climactic battle against Voldemort, set in an immense storeroom with thousands of shelves vanishing into inky infinity, is magisterial.)
This may not be the "Phoenix" a lot of people want to see. There are two audiences for a "Harry Potter" film. The first wants the book replicated on the screen down to the last period and portkey, and if it isn't, lo, the instant-message tantrums will be many and studded with exclamation points. (There's a reason this reviewer elects not to read the books: I'd rather focus on what's in the movie than be distracted by what's left out.)
The second audience wanders in wondering what the fuss is about and hoping for a good circus. "Phoenix" doesn't really deliver that, either. No Hungarian Horntails on the roof of Hogwarts this time, just a few centaurs and a sense of growing fury that the grown-ups aren't listening. This one's for the Rowling fans who understand movies can be much, much more than photocopied books. The question is whether they're out there.


Ten days after Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix  opens, the ultimate outcome of our hero's campaign against the nefarious Lord Voldemort will be revealed in the book world, where true Harry Potter fans reside. As trillions of readers are anxiously aware, J.K. Rowling's seventh and final installment will have to make good on the harsh prophecy that ''either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.'' In the movie world, meanwhile, the battle lines are just being drawn. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and his classmates Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are in their fifth year of study at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. And the weight of responsibility being laid on Harry  now quite believably embodied by the increasingly chiseled 17-year-old actor as a teenager with all the moods that come with the hormones  is enough to darken this fifth movie interpretation decisively.
Gone are the childish diversions of Quidditch matches and other jewel-toned visual manifestations of magical thinking, and in their place is an attitude of grim, adult risk taking. Under the circumstances, assigning the project to British TV director David Yates, who won awards for the 2003 BBC political thriller State of Play , is a shrewd choice. (Screenwriter Michael Goldenberg is also a newbie to the Potter franchise.) This episode spends time with the student gang as they practice wand work and imprecations (''Stupefy!'' ), and pauses for a sweet kiss between Harry and Cho Chang (Katie Leung), whose shy smile first fogged the young wizard's glasses in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire . We also meet Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch), Harry's pale and empathic new friend, and Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), whose name suits this Azkaban Prison escapee's style but underplays her sadism.
But for all the action  and there's plenty of it, even if it's only a portion of what was crammed into Rowling's 870 pages  the most important stuff is what takes place in Harry's head, where troubling visions, intensifying in clarity and dread, attest to the young man's foretold connection to the evildoer most safely referred to as You-Know-Who. (You know who plays Voldemort, again, too: Ralph Fiennes, embracing his character's malevolent noselessness with regal delight.) And therein lies a conundrum  of busyness and waiting  that The Order of the Phoenix  can't magically solve. The advances and setbacks pile up, but time hangs heavy. And that's even after Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) puts Harry on trial for illegally using magic outside of school and Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) intervenes. After Harry's godfather, Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), entrusts his godson with new secrets. And after the students establish Dumbledore's Army in preparation for Voldemortian Armageddon.
In the midst of such earthbound preparations, though, an image of menace upholstered in pink arrives to rock wizards and Muggles alike: the deliciously named Dolores Umbridge. Bullheaded in his insistence that Voldemort has not  returned (despite Harry's eyewitness report), Fudge installs Umbridge at Hogwarts to teach a strictly censored and quite useless version of Defense Against the Dark Arts. And she is as shockingly fascistic in her approach to old-fashioned values as she is amusingly dowdy. Rowling describes the woman's voice as ''fluttery, girlish, high-pitched.'' But a  festive Imelda Staunton (memorably dressed in drab to star in Vera Drake ) has other plans: Her showstopping Dolores slays her charges with pepperminty steeliness. ''Progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged!'' this educator from hell proclaims.
With her wardrobe upgraded to suits and pillbox hats that, in a blander color, might entice Queen Elizabeth II (the Umbridge hairdo appears to be a direct homage), the character is a Pepto-Bismol-tinted bolt of energy  and political commentary  inspiring grand gestures from her costars. When Staunton's Umbridge goes up against Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall, it's a wonder the movie-set walls don't crumble. As that singularly acidic potions teacher Severus Snape, Alan Rickman responds to the new blood by lacing his sneers with an even more flavorful degree of sourness. The flourishes don't answer the question most on Potterites' minds  who lives, who dies?  but they briefly stupefy.

 “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,” the fifth movie in the series, begins, as most of the others have, with a spot of unpleasantness at the Dursleys, and ends with Harry facing down Lord Voldemort. The climactic battle between the young wizard (Daniel Radcliffe) and the Dark Lord (Ralph Fiennes) foreshadows the final, potentially fatal showdown we all suspect is coming in Book Seven, which will be published later this month.  Anticipation of that event may be stealing some thunder from this movie — a rare instance of the book business beating Hollywood at its own hype-producing game — but between now and publication day on July 21, Potter fans can take some satisfaction in a sleek, swift and exciting adaptation of J. K. Rowling’s longest novel to date. Devotees of fine British acting, meanwhile, can savor the addition of Imelda Staunton (an Oscar nominee for “Vera Drake”) to the roster of first-rate thespians moonlighting as Hogwarts faculty.  Curiously enough, “Order of the Phoenix,” clocking in at a little over two and a quarter hours, is the shortest of the “Harry Potter” films. The nearly 900-page source has been elegantly streamlined by Michael Goldenberg, the screenwriter (who replaces Steve Kloves), and David Yates, the director (who follows Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell in the job). There is no Quidditch, and not many boarding-school diversions. Instead, “Order of the Phoenix,” which begins like a horror movie with a Dementor attack in a suburban underpass, proceeds as a tense and twisty political thriller, with clandestine meetings, bureaucratic skullduggery and intimations of conspiracy hanging in the air.  Mr. Yates, whose previous work has mainly been in television, is best known in Britain for “State of Play,” a brilliant mini- series about power, corruption and deceit. Those are among the themes he explores in this film, which depicts a wizard world riven by factionalism and threatened by chaos and inflexible authoritarianism. While Cornelius Fudge, the minister of magic (Robert Hardy), maintains his highly suspect denial of Voldemort’s return, a coup at Hogwarts threatens the benevolent administration of Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). Harry, meanwhile, has gone from prince to pariah, smeared in the magical press (where his name is rendered “Harry Plotter”) and subject to cold stares and whispers at school. Back in Harry’s early days at Hogwarts, Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), Harry’s foil and reluctant ally, sneered at the boy’s “celebrity.” But in this episode, the boy — if you can still call him that — encounters the darker side of fame.  Some of his schoolmates doubt his account of the death of Cedric Diggory, who was killed by Voldemort at the end of the previous film, “Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.” Dumbledore, Harry’s chief patron and protector over the years, seems to be keeping his distance, which leaves Harry feeling abandoned and betrayed. And more acutely, the pressures of being a designated hero — and possibly martyr — have begun to weigh on Harry, to isolate him from friends and to come between him and the possibility of a normal teenage life.  He does, at least, experience a first kiss with Cho Chang (Katie Leung), but that turns out to be a brief and equivocal moment of bliss. Whereas “Goblet of Fire” plunged Harry and his pals into the murky waters of awakening adolescent sexuality (or at least got their toes wet), “Order of the Phoenix” tackles the emotional storms that can buffet young people on their way to adulthood. Mr. Radcliffe, maturing as an actor in perfect time with his character, emphasizes Harry’s anger and self-pity. Mr. Yates frequently places him alone on one side of the frame, with Ron and Hermione (Rupert Grint and Emma Watson), his loyal but increasingly estranged friends, together on the other.  But this is not an Ingmar Bergman film, though perhaps Mr. Bergman can be coaxed into service for the film version of “Deathly Hallows,” the final book of the series. “Order of the Phoenix” has its grim, bleak elements, but it is also, after all, an installment in a mighty multimedia entertainment franchise. And like its predecessors, it manages to succeed as a piece of entertainment without quite fulfilling its potential as a movie. Perhaps by design, the films never quite live up to the books. This one proves to be absorbing but not transporting, a collection of interesting moments rather than a fully integrated dramatic experience. This may just be a consequence of the necessary open-endedness of the narrative, or of an understandable desire not to alienate “Potter” readers by taking too many cinematic chances.  Although “Order of the Phoenix” is not a great movie, it is a pretty good one, in part because it does not strain to overwhelm the audience with noise and sensation. There are some wonderful special-effects-aided set pieces — notably an early broomstick flight over London — and some that are less so. People waving wands at one another, even accompanied by bright lights and scary sounds, does not quite sate this moviegoer’s appetite for action. But the production design (by Stuart Craig) and the cinematography (by Slawomir Idziak) are frequently astonishing in their aptness and sophistication. The interiors of the Ministry of Magic offer a witty, nightmarish vision of wizardly bureaucracy, while Harry’s angst and loneliness register in Mr. Idziak’s cold, washed-out shades of blue.  The scariest color in his palette, however, turns out to be pink. That is the color favored by Dolores Umbridge (Ms. Staunton), whose cheery English-auntie demeanor masks a ruthlessly autocratic temperament. She posts proclamations on the Hogwarts walls, subjects violators to painful punishments and substitutes book learning for practical magic. Her purpose is to institute Minister Fudge’s head-in-the-sand policy with respect to the Voldemort threat, and she does a heck of a job.  Ms. Staunton joins an astonishing ensemble of serious actors who, in the best British tradition, refuse to condescend to the material, earning their paychecks and the gratitude of the grown-ups in the audience. Mr. Rickman has turned Snape (whose animus against Harry is partly explained here) into one of the most intriguingly ambiguous characters in modern movies, and it is always a treat to see the likes of Emma Thompson, David Thewlis and Gary Oldman, however briefly.  Even better, the Potter enterprise has become a breeding ground for the next generation of British acting talent. Mr. Radcliffe has already spread his wings (and dropped his pants) on the London stage, and cultural pessimists of my generation can take comfort in knowing that while our parents may have witnessed Malcolm McDowell and Julie Christie in their prime, our children will see Mr. Grint and Ms. Watson in theirs. “Order of the Phoenix” also introduces Evanna Lynch, a pale, wide-eyed 15-year-old nonprofessional from Ireland who, having read the book, decided that no one else could play Luna Lovegood, the weirdest witch at Hogwarts. It seems Ms. Lynch was right. She’s spellbinding.  “Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its violence is intense, though not graphic, and some of its images are quite scary.

The students at Hogwarts leave youthful hijinks behind once and for all in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix." Considerably grimmer and grittier than the previous pictures in the phenomenally successful series, new entry finds the young charges' head-on collision with adolescence taking a backseat to their sober confrontation with unvarnished evil. Pottermania will reach a peak in July with the nearly simultaneous release of the fifth film and the seventh and final book, and only commercial concern for Warner Bros. may be that, after the second or third week, curiosity about the concluding tome could overshadow interest in the film. 
Extravagantly produced in the expected manner, pic nevertheless marks a notable departure in tone from those that preceded it. From the opening scene, portents of bad tidings ahead hang over everyone and everything connected to the wizarding world, even as the magical establishment insists there is no threat at large in the land.
Altered feel this time around stems in large measure from the new blood recruited to push the franchise into ever-darker domains. Director David Yates, heretofore known mostly for his television work (and already engaged to helm the sixth film); screenwriter Michael Goldenberg, replacing series perennial Steve Kloves; and composer Nicholas Hooper, whose vigorously dramatic music uses only a smidgen of John Williams' themes, make the most decisive difference in steering the focus away from flights of fancy and in-house intrigue in favor of elaborate and sometimes heavy-handed foreshadowing of the inevitable showdown between Harry and Lord Voldemort.
Concentrated focus results in an unsettling mood and dramatic scenes of unusual intensity. But condensing the book, which at 870 pages is the longest J.K. Rowling has written, into the shortest film in the series has come at a price. Many viewers won't at all mind that this is the first "Potter" picture without a Quidditch match, nor that house elves and cutesy ghosts are largely absent as well.
But more serious is the diminishment of the myriad intrigues among individuals and factions that comprise so much of the stories' delightfully complicated fabric. Interplay detailing the fluctuating relationships involving Harry, Hermione, Ron (particularly slighted here), Cho Chang and intriguing newcomer Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) is sacrificed in favor of repeated group scenes of Harry teaching his clandestine band of teenage warriors the finer points of wand work. Classroom scenes are scanted and a sense of the school year passing is minute, giving the film a flattened-out feel compared to the wondrous eventfulness of Mike Newell's "Goblet of Fire," the last and most successful series installment.
Current yarn commences at the end of a parched English summer, when Harry (Daniel Radcliffe, back with a clean-cut look) lands in hot water with the Ministry of Magic for issuing a forbidden curse to fend off an attack by two Dementors. Harry's Inquisition-like hearing, where he narrowly escapes expulsion from Hogwarts thanks to the unexpected intervention of Dumbledore (Michael Gambon), sets out the central conflict: The Ministry refuses to accept Harry's contention that Lord Voldemort is back and, in fact, is prepared to put all its propaganda muscle into discrediting Harry and Dumbledore.
To this end, the Ministry imposes one of its own as this year's professor of the Dark Arts. Dolores Umbridge is one of Rowling's most delicious -- and resonantly named -- creations; a stout, toad-like woman reliably clad in shades of pink, Umbridge is a party functionary par excellence, a rules-and-regulations fanatic with a whim of iron who cloaks her proscriptive edicts in dulcet tones and manufactured smiles. Imelda Staunton was the perfect choice for the part and unsurprisingly emerges as one of the film's greatest pleasures.
Umbridge wastes no time clamping down on Harry, the other kids and the Hogwarts staff; assuming more power virtually by the day, she puts her most outspoken student in painful detention, prohibits the learning of practical curses, begins firing wayward teachers and ultimately confronts Dumbledore to assert complete Ministry control over the school.
In response, Harry assembles an underground rebel band known as Dumbledore's Army. The intense way these passages are staged lead one to believe they are the scenes that most engaged the interest of director Yates, who seems to relish the image of Harry and Hermione as nascent revolutionary leaders.
Similarly prominent are Harry's renewed relationship with his beloved godfather Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), hiding away in the secret family homestead in London, and his nightmarish visions of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), with whom he increasingly feels a disturbingly strong connection. It gets so bad that he is forced to receive private tutoring from the dreaded Professor Snape, whose distaste for the task could not be more pronounced. Until shortly before the end, Snape has very little to do, but Alan Rickman may have outdone himself; seldom has an actor done more with less than he does here.
Climactic showdown between Harry's crew and Voldemort's henchmen, led by Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), is strikingly played out in a huge Ministry storeroom filled with shelved grapefruit-sized globes containing prophecies. One such sphere concerning Harry is of vital interest to Voldemort, and performing especially well on his behalf is Sirius' malignant cousin Bellatrix Lestrange, embodied by Helena Bonham Carter with a particularly maniacal glee.
It doesn't take much of a leap to connect the ill winds afflicting Hogwarts, along with the sweaty anticipation of inevitable conflict, with the present situation in the world at large. The metaphors are all implicit and have a lot to do with just growing up and facing unpleasant realities, but they increasingly contribute to the feeling of nervousness and unease creeping into the series. It will be interesting to see if general anticipation for the two remaining films holds fast or tails off once the epic series' conclusion is revealed in the final book.

The darkest and most threatening of the five Potter films, Harry Potter  and the Order of the Phoenix is also the only series entry outside of the third, Alfonso Cuarón 's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , that feels like the product of a vivid cinematic imagination and not just a faithful transposition of a kid-lit bestseller. The director, David Yates , brings an energy and efficiency to Potter Landthis is the series' fastest-moving (and, at a mere 139 minutes, shortest) installmentand infuses the heretofore storybook atmosphere with a grittiness that's as startling to our senses as it is to young Mr. Potter's.
Credit J.K. Rowling , too: Order of the Phoenix gives us the most compelling premise for a Potter picture yet, because it's the one least chained to an elaborate, mechanized plot. In narrative terms, not that much happens, but as for Harry's emotional journeywell, that's nearly epic. Still reeling from his standoff with the resurrected Lord Voldemort  at the end of 2005's Goblet of Fire , and from the death of his classmate Cedric Diggory , the already melancholic Harry (Daniel Radcliffe ) is, at the start of the new film, downright disconsolatea poster child for teen Prozac . Just when it seems like things couldn't get any worse, a couple of fearsome beasties come along to shake Harry out of his malaise . . . by nearly turning him into dinner.
Old Voldy, it seems, is stirring again, though few outside of the movie's titular cabala secret society formed by Hogwarts ' headmaster, Dumbledore  (Michael Gambon ), with the express purpose of vanquishing Voldemortwill acknowledge it. The officious Minister of Magic has taken to planting anti-Potter screeds in the The Daily Prophet . He also installs his loyal emissary (Imelda Staunton ) to prune Hogwarts' faculty of subversive elements and restrict the students' freedoms. This smiling sadist in fuchsia couture renders coy the protestation of Potter producer David Heyman that Order of the Phoenix  isn't a political allegory. This is, after all, a movie in which ineffectual bureaucrats refuse to acknowledge an imminent threat to their peopleand their power. Make of that what you will.
Order of the Phoenix  satisfies in all of the conventional ways: There are appearances by your favorite series regulars and CGI wonderments galore. The movie's most memorable encounters, however, take place not within Hogwarts, but upon the more perilous terrain of Harry's consciousness, which is a veritable minefield of fear, self-loathing, and pubescent confusion. Goblet of Fire the first PG-13 Potter pictried for a similar feeling of teenage Sturm und Drang, but Order of the Phoenix  sees adolescence as something altogether graver: It's the moment at which schoolboy frolic gives way to an understanding of the evil that men do in the world. Rowling has said repeatedly that she will retire all things Potter following the publication of the upcoming seventh novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows  . It's a pity, for there's every indication that Harry is on track for a whopper of a midlife crisis.
