There was a time when �ladies man� meant Tony Curtis in Some Like It Hot
, seducing secretaries with his eyes and his wit. Not so by today�s standards. Sandler (Click
) plays Chuck, a ladies man who collects enormous boxes of porn and frequently can be seen with half a dozen Hooters girls in his bedroom. Now, don�t get me wrong, I like Adam Sandler. And not just his wonderful turn in Punch Drunk Love
. Give me Billy Madison
 or Happy Gilmore
 any day. And on a lazy Sunday, I�m not above sitting back to enjoy The Wedding Singer
. But Sandler is funny as much as he is awkward. His raw humor works so well because it�s countered with a childish innocence that would rather throw water balloons at the Hooters girls than have them all in his bedroom at once. Then there�s Larry (The King of Queens
� James). Sweet and dopey, Larry has been mourning the death of his wife for more than a year. Chuck and Larry are best friends, manly men, and Brooklyn firefighters. When Larry can�t change the beneficiary of his insurance policy to his kids unless he gets married, he decides to marry Chuck for the benefits. But after the nuptials, the two men have to settle into married life for real in order to prove their legitimacy to a snoopy city inspector (Buscemi). Enter Biel (The Illusionist
), a young lawyer with a great ass who steals Chuck�s heart. As Chuck and Larry fight prejudice from strangers, friends, and co-workers, the movie turns from wild farce to gay-agenda movie. There�s actually a speech at the end where Chuck bemoans the use of the word �faggot,� one he so readily threw around at the beginning of the film. It�s a weak moment in a movie full of weak moments, contrived to the point of painful. And then there are the cameos. Everyone from Lance Bass and Richard Chamberlain to Dave Matthews wanted a piece of this mess. The strange cherry on top is that the screenplay was co-written by Academy Award-winning writer/director Alexander Payne (Sideways
, About Schmidt
) and his writing partner, Jim Taylor. Of course they brought in the talents of a former Golden Girls
 scribe to help out, which makes a little more sense. But the A-B-C plot plus every dick, butt, and fart joke in the book, divided by an effort to proclaim that this is really all about gay rights, equals a flick to skip this summer.

         It's always a risk to make a movie based on current events because the shelf life is so short. "Ripped from today's headlines" can quickly become tomorrow's big yawn. The creators of the comedy "I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry" seem to have tried to circumvent this problem by setting their movie in a land that time forgot.
 
 It's ostensibly contemporary Brooklyn, but aside from the fact that same-sex couples can register their domestic partnerships and go to Canada to be married, everything else about the movie feels firmly rooted in 1980 (or earlier). There are gags here that may be older than the film's stars, Adam Sandler and Kevin James.
 


         






   James plays Larry Valentine, a widowed New York firefighter who failed to change his beneficiary within the requisite 12 months and now faces leaving his children with nothing should he die on the job. The only fix offered him is to remarry — which somehow leads to him laying a guilt trip on his best buddy and fellow fireman, Chuck Levine (Sandler), to get him to agree to register as domestic partners.
 
 The two bruisers attempt to keep it on the down-low until a fussy fraud investigator (Steve Buscemi) starts digging through their trash, which he not surprisingly finds to be not very gay. On the advice of their "smokin' hot" attorney, Alex (Jessica Biel), Larry and Chuck reluctantly take the relationship to the next level, heading to Niagara Falls for a quicky wedding.
 
 That everyone they know save their up-and-at-'em captain (Dan Aykroyd) immediately accepts the arrangement despite their previously strident heterosexuality is dubious, but since the entire premise of the movie is riding on it you have to let it go.
 
 The depiction of gay life (or more precisely Chuck and Larry's experience of it) is more pathetic than offensive. It's one big disco ball of mincing and preening as far as they know, and the gay people they encounter do nothing to dispel that. Most annoying is the filmmakers' desire to have it both ways. They exploit the situational humor by deploying ridiculous stereotypes and the kind of language that got Isaiah Washington in trouble and then throw up a Hail Mary mea culpa 
by wrapping things up ever so neatly with a farfetched evolution toward understanding and acceptance.
 
 The movie takes the low road throughout, dispensing with the notion of going for anything but broad humor. And even though it was produced by Sandler's Happy Madison Productions and Tom Shadyac's Shady Acres Entertainment, heavyweights in the movie comedy world, "Chuck & Larry" fails to deliver on its main promise of big laughs, which is the film's truly unforgivable sin.
 
 Director Dennis Dugan resorts to a stream of cameos to invigorate the limp screenplay credited to Barry Fanaro ("Men in Black II") and (surprisingly) the "Sideways" team of Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, but it's not nearly enough.
 
 The basic concept of a mainstream movie riffing on the idea of resolutely straight guys entering into a gay marriage had potential as a comedy in the tradition of "Some Like It Hot," and James and Sandler have some actual chemistry as a duo. But by relying on stale jokes and simplistic notions of tolerance and acceptance, "Chuck & Larry" wastes the opportunity.
 
 
 "I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry." MPAA rating: PG-13 for crude sexual content through-out, nudity, language and drug references. Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes. In general release.   

At the moral high point of I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry , there's still this: Chuck and Larry are grossed out by a kiss. In the midst of speeches about tolerance  as well as yuks wrung from jokes about the fat that clings to widower Larry (Kevin James) and the women who cling to single guy Chuck (Adam Sandler)  the hetero firemen, who are faking a homosexual domestic partnership for health insurance coverage for Larry and his kids, are urged to express their love for one another, at what is surely the weirdest fraud-inquiry hearing ever to take place even in weird-friendly Brooklyn. Whereupon the two pucker like they're facing the gallows; the prospect is just that yucky.
So if I'm reading the ''message'' right in this lumbering, time-warp disco of a comedy about the heroism of firefighters, the preciousness of male bonding, the sanctity of family, and the glory of Jessica Biel's proudly real breasts, it's that gay men are marvelous, exotic, and hilarious creatures who have every right to equality under the law. And that it's very hurtful when they're discriminated against. Or beaten up. Or even shunned in communal firehouse showers, where straight colleagues are scared to pick up a dropped bar of soap. But if it's all the same to you, being straight is, you know, more regular. And, like, whew .
Perhaps I'm reading too much into a slab of honking Sandler comedy, made for an audience already predisposed to laugh when, early in the story, Chuck and Larry rescue an obese bed-bound man during a fire. (The massive fellow rolls on top of them! And then farts!) Or when Chuck finds himself attracted to Alex (Biel), the lawyer defending the couple against a suspicious insurance fraud investigator (Steve Buscemi), and gets invited to assess Alex's assets, ''girlfriend'' to girlfriend. (Tootsie  got there a quarter century ago, with more class.) But I can't shake the musty odor of comic overexertion coupled with Hollywood nervousness that wafts up from every scene. When the pair go shopping for items to gay up their home, naturally they grab lubricating gel from the personal products shelf. Don't all The Gays? That the movie, directed by Happy Gilmore  helmer Dennis Dugan, received a script revision by classy Sideways  talents Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor does dismayingly little to up the sophistication quotient.
Anyhow, it's not until Chuck and Larry actually experience discrimination that they begin, in their audience-safe, Neanderthal way, to understand what victimhood feels like. Myself, I felt victimized by the stereotype shtick of reliably grating Rob Schneider as a Canadian-Japanese wedding-chapel minister from SNL  castoff hell. But maybe that's just because this movie encourages sensitivity by hitting everyone over the head with its humor hammer.

 Sporadically funny, casually sexist, blithely racist and about as visually sophisticated as a parking-garage surveillance video, the new Adam Sandler comedy, “I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry,” looks, sounds and moves like most Adam Sandler comedies. In other words, once again Mr. Sandler plays  a regular Joe, here called Chuck, who stands around in the middle of the frame smirking and making fun of other people. Sometimes he makes you laugh, sometimes he makes you wince, though usually he makes you wonder how many times and in how many different permutations he will recycle his obnoxious Everyman.  Mr. Sandler’s  romantic foils have included Drew Barrymore, Emily Watson and Kate Beckinsale; here, the lucky lady is Chuck’s bosom buddy and fellow fireman, Larry. As played by an agreeable, sympathetic Kevin James (from the sitcom “The King of Queens”), Larry comes equipped with a widower’s broken heart, two young children and, like Chuck, a firm grasp on his heterosexuality. After he and Chuck experience a near-miss in a smoldering Brooklyn building, though, he decides that the best way to ensure his children’s future is to marry his best friend, which is the one and only reason this movie was made. Heterosexuality can be played for comedy or tragedy, sure. But homosexuality? Honey, that’s a scream.  That, in any event, is the approach taken by the director, Dennis Dugan, working from a screenplay credited to the bizarre triumvirate of Barry Fanaro, whose credits include years of working on the sitcom “The Golden Girls,” and Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor, who together wrote “Sideways,” “Election” and “About Schmidt.” It’s next to impossible to reconcile Mr. Payne and Mr. Taylor, who excel in sharply honed, intelligent satire, with the crude laughs and nyuck-nyuck physical high jinks that characterize “Chuck & Larry,” much less the relentless barrage of idiotic jokes about gay men, most of which hinge on sex, or rather straight male fear of such sex, and involve groaning puns about backdoors and the like.  Fear of a gay planet fuels plenty of American movies; it’s as de rigueur in comedy as in macho action. But what’s mildly different about “Chuck & Larry” is how sincerely it tries to have its rainbow cake and eat it too. In structural terms, the movie resembles a game of Mother May I, in that for every tiny step it takes forward in the name of enlightenment (gay people can be as boring as heterosexuals), it takes three giant steps back, often by piling on more jokes about gay sex (some involving a priceless Ving Rhames). Into this mix add the stunningly unfunny Rob Schneider, who pops up brandishing buckteeth, glasses and  an odious accent in apparent homage to Mickey Rooney’s painful, misguided turn as the Japanese neighbor in “Breakfast at Tiffany’s.”  “I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry” has been deemed safe for conscientious viewing by a representative of the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, a media watchdog group. Given the movie’s contempt for women, who mainly just smile, sigh and wiggle their backdoors at the camera, it’s  too bad that some lesbian (and Asian)  Glaad  members didn’t toss in their two cents about the movie.  If Mr. Sandler dares speak in favor of gay love in “Chuck & Larry” — at least when it’s legally sanctioned, tucked behind closed doors and not remotely feminine — it’s only because homosexuality represents one type of love among men. Here, boys can be boys, together in bed and not, but heaven forbid that any of them look or behave like women.  “I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Lots of jokes about gay men, racist stereotypes, scantily clad women, drinking, smoking and cursing.

Relentlessly juvenile and awash in stereotypes, "I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry" is the kind of buddy comedy Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau might have starred in 40 years ago, when the material would have felt less dated, if no less silly. Kevin James and Adam Sandler hardly approach that standard, and it will be slightly depressing if a barrage of schoolyard gay jokes passes for "edgy" a quarter-century after "Victor/Victoria." Taken for what it is, pic should find its sweet spot somewhere between the easily offended and very easily amused, providing Universal with a modest summer tryst.
Produced by Sandler's Happy Madison and Tom Shadyac's Shady Acres shingles, "Chuck and Larry" miscasts Sandler as a ladies man who's Mr. February on a firefighters calendar, bedding women in multiples of two and four. Hey, it's nice to be the boss.
In another incongruous pairing, "Sideways" writing team Alexander Payne and Jim Taylor join "Golden Girls" scribe Barry Fanaro and director Dennis Dugan (who previously helmed Sandler's "Happy Gilmore"). Pic initially plays like a screwball comedy with a bit more smarts, but ultimately, the more banal sitcom impulses win out.
Larry (James) is a widowed firefighter with two kids who discovers that, thanks to bureaucratic red tape, he risks losing his benefits if something happens to him. The improbable solution: Enter into a domestic partnership with his pal and co-worker Chuck (Sandler), leaving the money and kids to him.
Yet after filing the paperwork, the two are advised by a beautiful attorney (Jessica Biel) that such a fraudulent ruse has landed others in considerable trouble, forcing them to prove the charade is real. This puts them in the crosshairs of an obsessive fraud investigator (Steve Buscemi) while rendering them poster children for gay rights, prompting others to keep throwing open their closet doors.
Along the way, the movie repeatedly slips in "Bias is bad" messages among all the gay jokes, including an extended don't-drop-the-soap-when-showering-at-the-firehouse gag. Forced to forgo sex, meanwhile, Chuck actually begins to develop an adult bond with his unwitting lawyer, which doesn't stop him from feeling up her boobs in a moment of sisterly bonding.
Dugan is hardly a master of subtlety, and given the limitations of their leads, the producers' smartest move is to populate the cast with talented supporting players who can milk laughs from the mostly inane setups. Tops among these are Ving Rhames as a fellow fireman and Dan Aykroyd as the fast-talking fire chief.
Buscemi's cartoonish shtick, by contrast, falls painfully flat, and Sandler's former "Saturday Night Live" posse (Rachel Dratch, Robert Smigel, plus an uncredited David Spade and Rob Schneider) also turn out in abundance, with Schneider's caricaturish portrayal of an Asian wedding coordinator possibly the most embarrassing of that sort since Mickey Rooney in "Breakfast at Tiffany's."
Again subjected to a parade of fat jabs, James possesses a vulnerable, likable lug quality that served him well in TV as well as in "Hitch." Sandler's fans should enjoy hearing him toss off lines about being "big-time fruits" or having "boarded the dude train." The two also have fun with their relationship, occasionally squabbling like a married couple.
Even the most generous-minded, however, will have their patience tested as the movie overstays its welcome in the extended last act, which can't be salvaged by a couple thematic cameos by actors including Richard Chamberlain.
With the material pitched so broadly, "Chuck and Larry" clearly hopes not to give offense, which isn't to say that some gays won't understandably be put off by it. The movie's only aim, however, is to ride the "dude train" to happily ever after -- a marriage of comedy and commerce that appears unlikely to endure for very long.

I can't speak to the achievement of I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry within the Adam Sandler  oeuvre. Geeky Jews are totally my type, but Sandler's never suited my taste in comedy. His enormous popularity has always seemed one of those straight things I'll never understand, like the widespread delusion that Scarlett Johansson  can act. Having recently registered for domestic partnership with my  geeky Jew (hi, Glen!), and long annoyed by Hollywood  homosexuals (suck my balls, Philadelphia ), I approached "the Adam Sandler gay-marriage movie" with a little curiosity and a lot of baggage (made in Paris, Martin Margiela ).
There are faggot jokes and flaming galore in Chuck and Larry , a movie that exploits gay stereotypes even as it mounts (from behind) an ingenious dismantling of homophobia. Made by straight people for straight people, this lowbrow comedy about super-butch firemen (Sandler and Kevin James ) faking a gay marriage is a very queer landmark indeed. No joke, the bar has been raised, not least on the potential of "don't drop the soap" routines.
Somewhere in the cafeteria at GLAAD  headquarters, girlfriend is about to choke on her quiche, but here goes: Tremendously savvy in its stupid way, I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry is as eloquent as Brokeback Mountain , and even more radical. "The gay cowboy movie" liberated desires latent in the classic western, and made them palpable (and palatable) by channeling them into the strictures of another genre, romantic tragedy. Progressive values were advanced by a retreat to a traditional mode of storytelling, the love that dare not speak its name rendered intelligible through the universal language of the upscale weepy.
Chuck and Larry  takes this strategy much further, baiting a far less adventuresome demographic. Gay themes won't deter the Sandler cult, who can rely on their man not to be a fag. And that, precisely, is the canny maneuver here. Our pussy-loving men's men are New York City firefighters to boot, the very embodiment of all-American heroism (and object of gay fetishism). Sandler's womanizing bachelor Chuck Levine  reluctantly agrees to play the homo husband of his buddy Larry Valentine  to help secure pension benefits for Larry's kidsone of whom, a flaming little 'mo named Eric (Cole Morgan ), likes to practice numbers from Pippin in an outfit inspired by Flashdance . Oh, snap! Chuck and Larry  is the first movie to effectively hijack that all-purpose justification for right-wing bigotry, "protecting the children," and redeploy it as a weapon of the homosexual intifada.
Where the clowning queers of Birdcage invite us to laugh at their antics, the faux-mos in Chuck and Larry  disarm prejudice by unabashedly reveling in its idiotic assumptions. "I used to wrestle in high school," is the gayest thing Chuck can think of, "and, uh, I liked it." The movie isn't effective despite  the egregious gay stereotypes; it couldn't work without them. Through the medium of an Adam Sandler comedy, with all the requisite vulgarity, we're given access to what it feels like to be ostracized, to live under false pretenses, to suffer a sham marriage. It does with crass what Brokeback  did with class, slipping dangerous sentiments into the safest of genres.
This sodomite had a gay old time. The coup of the movie is that Sandlerites will, too. They're the ones unmistakably addressed in the courtroom climax, the moment when Chuck and Larry confess their deceptions and assert their principles. Momentarily possessed by remarkable authenticity, Sandler seems to step out of character as he appeals to the crowd to stop using the word "faggot." I've used it a lot myself in the past, he says in a manner less like a line reading than a mea culpa, but it hurts the same way it does if you called me a kike.
Sandler feels like the authentic auteur of that sentiment, even if the words are credited to Barry Fanaro , a writer-producer of The Golden Girls , and the writing team of Alexander Payne  and Jim Taylor , creators of two or three of the most acclaimed American movies of the past 10 years. It's impossible to know how much of the final script derives from the authors of Election, About Schmidt, and Sideways , and how much flowed from the pen responsible, most recently, for Men in Black II . Kudos to all. I have never heard the cause of gay equality more delectably phrased than as "the right to put whatever you want up your ass."
