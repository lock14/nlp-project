 "Giuliani Time," Kevin Keating's new documentary about the former mayor of New York City, begins several years after its subject has left office, at the 2004 Republican National Convention. In his speech there, Rudolph W. Giuliani evoked the  Sept. 11 attacks, and recalled that on that dreadful morning he had turned to Bernard B. Kerik, his police commissioner at the time, and said, "Thank God George Bush is president."  Who knows how many of Mr. Giuliani's constituents shared that sentiment — or how many fewer would endorse it now. But my own recollections of that day suggest that a lot of New Yorkers, including many who were far from fond of Mr. Giuliani, were thankful that he was their mayor. Certainly, his response to the attacks has burnished his image in the national media, and helped to make him a plausible — or at least a discussable — contender for his party's presidential nomination in 2008.  The intention behind "Giuliani Time," which was begun in 1998, early in Mr. Giuliani's second term, seems to be to tarnish this luster. The title suggests as much, referring as it does to a phrase that Abner Louima, a Haitian immigrant tortured and sodomized by officers in a Brooklyn station house in 1997, claimed one of his tormenters taunted. Later, he retracted that claim, which makes Mr. Keating's use of it all the more provocative, and signals that the movie's agenda will be to associate Mr. Giuliani's tenure with brutality, racial revanchism and contempt for civil liberties.  The film, while hardly unbiased, is not entirely one-sided. Its main voices are those of the mayor's detractors, led by Wayne Barrett, the Village Voice reporter and author of a highly critical biography of Mr. Giuliani. But some of his allies and admirers also have their say, including Donald Trump, Representative Peter T. King, and Heather Mac Donald and Myron Magnet of the Manhattan Institute, the conservative intellectual hothouse where many of the policy ideas of the Giuliani administration were aired and debated.  The most famous of these was the "broken windows" theory of policing, advanced by the criminologist George L. Kelling (who also appears in the movie), which held that the enforcement of laws against minor "quality of life" infractions like graffiti, public drinking or subway-fare evasion could prevent more serious crimes from occurring. "Giuliani Time" does a good job of presenting the arguments for and against this idea, which the mayor and his supporters believe was the key to the dramatic reduction in crime that took place while he was in office.  The debate is likely to continue, even as New Yorkers continue to enjoy a city that is safer than anyone 20 years ago would have thought possible. Over all, most of the talking heads in "Giuliani Time" are rather grudging in giving Mr. Giuliani credit, or, for that matter, in granting the importance of crime as an issue in urban politics.  The history presented in the film is sometimes selective. Noting that crime had begun to fall under Mr. Giuliani's predecessor, David N. Dinkins, the movie wonders why Mr. Dinkins was perceived as ineffectual, and wonders also how Mr. Giuliani, who had lost a close election to Mr. Dinkins in 1989, was able to exploit this perception when he narrowly won their rematch four years later. And yet no mention is made of the violence in Crown Heights in 1991, which a federal report found  Mr. Dinkins's administration had mishandled, and which had a lot to do with swinging some votes in the 1993 election against him.  In general, and in spite of its deft use of archival video clips and interviews, "Giuliani Time" offers a superficial reading of recent New York history, zeroing in on the headlines while often missing the context. We hear about the low turnout in the elections Mr. Giuliani won, information that implicitly minimizes the extent of his popular support but that might just as well be evidence that his Democratic opponents — first Mr. Dinkins and then Ruth W. Messinger — failed to inspire their own partisans. The people of New York, we are told, were fooled, bullied and "bamboozled" by Mr. Giuliani, who beat Ms. Messinger (in her own account) because he refused to conduct a substantive debate on the issues.  These are the things people tend to say when their ideological enemies win. Left unexamined is how the Democratic Party, with its overwhelming demographic and institutional advantages in New York, has managed to lose four mayoral elections in a row.  As someone who voted in all of those elections — and, no, I won't say for whom — I can hardly claim neutrality. But, like a lot of New Yorkers who lived here through the Giuliani era, I can confess ambivalence, and I'm grateful to Mr. Keating for reminding me, perhaps to some extent inadvertently, of what a complicated figure Mr. Giuliani was and remains.  The film shows that, while his decisiveness,  forensic intelligence and  wit could be impressive,  they could easily shade into high-handedness, arrogance and meanness. His success in fighting crime was always shadowed by his failure to establish any real rapport with the city's black and Hispanic citizens, and by his unwarranted harshness when dealing with artists, welfare recipients and the homeless. He had a knack for turning allies into critics, as demonstrated in this film by William J. Bratton, police commissioner during Mr. Giuliani's first term, and Rudy Crew, schools chancellor from 1995 to 1999.  Mr. Giuliani is not interviewed; the filmmaker has said his repeated requests were denied.  "Giuliani Time" makes the case that Mr. Giuliani's true ideological identity is conservative, and makes this case in a way that is sure to appall liberals who felt queasy about him in the first place (or guilty when they voted for him). But of course Mr. Giuliani, if he does run for president, will want to make the same case to Republicans, and in some ways "Giuliani Time" might work to his advantage, since it never mentions, say, his support for gay rights or his endorsement of Mario M. Cuomo in the 1994 governor's race. Mr. Giuliani was always a hybrid and, in some ways, a paradox:  something both he and this movie might prefer that we forget.

Before Rudy Giuliani seemed on the fast track to sainthood, there was a time -- almost reeking of nostalgia at this post-9/11 date -- when his autocratic rule over Gotham ruffled more than a few feathers. Veteran cinematographer Kevin Keating remembers those days and makes them fresh again in his first-rate docu "Giuliani Time." Chock-a-block with incisive commentaries both pro and con, pic's sole drawback is its quick finish on that fateful September day without updating Rudy's subsequent rise and fall. Interest will be high in Gotham itself, but yesterday's news may not play so well in Peoria.
Keating, best known for his lensing on docus by the Maysles brothers and Barbara Kopple, spent more than five years working on "Giuliani Time" but then faced an icy reception from distribs unwilling to handle a critique of the man seen by many as the heroic face of the Big Apple. Now that the Bernie Kerik debacle has given Giuliani another shiner, the time seems ripe for this unflattering appraisal of Rudy's years in public life.
Investigative biographer and "Village Voice" editor Wayne Barrett acts as Keating's guide through Giuliani's well-hidden family past, with its ties to gambling joints, the Mob, and Sing Sing. A brief discussion of the early years leads to Giuliani's rapid promotion in the D.A.'s office and his controversial role in the deportation of Haitian boat people.
Main chunk of time is spent on Giuliani's years as mayor, when his zero tolerance policies received worldwide attention and outsiders praised the Disneyfication of Babylon-on-the-Hudson. Through well-chosen commentators ranging from lawyers, community activists and assorted politicos, Keating strips away the self-aggrandizement and analyzes the record, setting into a national context the acclaimed drop in crime and the mayor's concentration on perceived "quality of life" problems.
Especially damning are discussions of Giuliani's cold regard for racial issues, highlighted by his polarizing handling of the traumatic Abner Louima and Amadou Diallo cases. Surprisingly, Keating fails to make anything of Giuliani's orders to surround City Hall with massive concrete barriers, a move that perfectly symbolized his disdain for dissenting opinions. Former mayor Ed Koch pointedly remarks that Giuliani "uses the levers of power to punish."
All seemed to come crashing to earth in early 2001, when health issues and private scandals saw his influence plummet. But then came 9/11.
Superb use of footage is to be expected from Keating, who made his career working with a pantheon of American docu makers. Tech aspects are flawless -- even down to Donald Trump's credit-worthy makeup.

In the works since Rudolph Giuliani  was still mayor and still policing the city with totalitarian quality-of-life tactics, Kevin Keating 's doc Giuliani Time  hits the bricks right in time to piss off the "Draft Rudy for President" campaign heading toward 2008. As well it should: Keating, an experienced doc DP who worked on Barbara Kopple 's Harlan County  U.S.A. , opens fire on the Giuliani New Yorkers used to know, pre9-11, the lisping, vampiric demagogue whose public wars on refugees, homeless people, and squeegee men won him national fame and local loathing. There's no shortage of archival video at Keating's disposal, but he still relies heavily on longtime Gotham bloodhound and Voice  staffer Wayne Barrett  to retrace the narrative of his Rudy!: An Investigative Biography of Rudolph Giuliani , burping up scores of incidents we have, or would rather have, forgotten by now, from Haitian corpses on Florida beaches when Rudy was assistant U.S. attorney to the incendiary experiences of Abner Louima  and Amadou Diallo .
There are nauseating surprises, particularly a memorable moment in which Giuliani mocked and dismissed a call-in critic on his radio show who, Keating shows, has Parkinson's and had been reduced to poverty by the mayor's protocols. But Giuliani Time is best considered an incisive portrait of power seizure and class combat as it was performed, by the numbers, on the municipal level. It's the Reagan paradigm in a teapot: Terrorize the citizenry with harmless bogeymen (the homeless, welfare moms, artists), claim credit for social change you did not create (crime was on a three-year decline before he took office, and dipped in most cities, regardless of policy), foster the illusion of order and control (where did  the homeless go?), shout bootstrap ballyhoo about freeloaders (the "workfare" program was on its face a form of indentured servitude), and ignore all evidence to the contrary, civil rights, real poverty, and the First Amendment. Most of all, use publicity to lie so relentlessly that the populace and the media take the fiction of success (nearly all of Giuliani's triumphant stats were bloated, skewed, or untrue) as their starting point.
After 9-11, a sick, scandalized lame-duck mayor became a national hero for simply keeping his composure on TV. Keating's film is a comet out of the past, but it's focused, if only circumstantially, on the future. Faithful Republican thug, Giuliani may be our destiny in national politicsa man who's capable of boasting (during the last GOP  convention) that upon seeing a body falling from the twin towers he turned to Bernard Kerik  and said, "Thank God George Bush  is our president!"
