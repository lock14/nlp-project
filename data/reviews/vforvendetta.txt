�Are you, like, a crazy person?� asks Evey Hammond (Portman), moments after being rescued from the post-curfew clutches of a pair of government enforcer/thugs by the swashbuckling, masked enigma known only as �V� (Weaving). As it turns out, he is � the Guy Fawkes mask cloaking his face, with its postcoital Mona Lisa
 grin and echoes of powder-kegs past is a dead giveaway. He�s also the last virulent gasp and raised fist of rebellion amidst a cowed and broken British citizenry in the year 2020, a place we quickly discover is at once heavily, obviously redolent of the fascistic stink of George Orwell�s 1984
, and, in the film�s most unnerving moments, a place with eerie parallels to the one in which the world � the real world � currently finds itself. �America,� we are told, is now �the world�s largest leper colony,� brought to its knees by terrorism, plague, and all manner of not-unimaginable crises. England, however, has endured, thanks to a contrived rise in jackboots and truncheons and the rebirth of outright fascism in the wake of its own horrific terror attacks. (It�s interesting if not entirely relevant to note that in a grim moment of art and reality going head-to-head, V for Vendetta
�s initial release date of November 5, 2005 was pushed back to its current slot in the wake of the London bombings of last July.) V himself is a terrorist (or, if you prefer, a freedom fighter), and he proves it by blowing up a major British landmark moments after saving Evey�s life. He then commandeers the airwaves and invites the shellshocked citizenry to stand beside him in exactly one year when he will blow up the Parliament and thereby, hopefully, shatter tyranny�s stranglehold on his country. All of this is a prelude to one of the most eloquent tales in ages of dysfunctional love � between a man and his ideals; between a country and its government; and, in the end, between Evey and V. Scripted by the Wachowski brothers (the Matrix
 trilogy) and adapted from the graphic novel by Alan Moore (Watchmen
, who, in a fit of pique too complicated to go into here, has since had his name removed from the film), V for Vendetta
 is first and foremost a futuristic slice of pop-culture agitprop, replete with a costumed antihero, lovingly choreographed action sequences, and a terrific, rousing score by Dario Marianelli. It�s also rife with cunningly ornate dialogue � the hyper-literate V is as skilled with his tongue as he is with his more prosaic ordnance � and most enchantingly, a surplus of smarts. This is a thinking person�s action film and all the more entertaining for it. Heroic sloganeering abounds: �People should not be afraid of their governments; governments should be afraid of their people� and �A revolution without dancing is a revolution not worth having,� the latter nicked from feminist Emma Goldman, are two of the more memorable (and accurate) ones. It�s also a slam-bang piece of popcorn entertainment. Like its titular revolutionary, it is not, however, without its faults, chief among them a muddy narrative through-line and Hurt�s gnashing, overkill performance as the Big Brother-esque Chancellor Sutler. That�s balanced by one of the most exquisitely nuanced performances Portman has ever offered � she�s as radiant and revolutionary as the Statue of Liberty and her innate humanity carries the film across its weaker and more pedantic potholes. Whether V for Vendetta
, the tale of a girl and her terrorist and the homeland they both love and revile in equal measure, withstands the test of time and becomes a pop-culture cinematic touchstone remains to be seen. What it has for certain, and what it has in spades, are some very real ideas. And, to paraphrase this V fellow, ideas are box-office-proof.


Something is wrong in the totalitarian state of England. Actually, everything is wrong: minorities, gays, and "radical" protesters have disappeared into death camps, the secret police known as "fingermen" rule the night, and the population has been bludgeoned into sheeplike compliance by wall-to-wall disaster reports in the media. The face of the rabid fascist leader Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt) looms from posters and TV screens, and you can almost taste the spittle from his lips.
"V for Vendetta" wants you to wonder how much of this sounds familiar, and, worse, how much of it might become familiar with a few twists of history's tail. Then it wants you to root for the masked man who plans to blow it all up. Is he a terrorist or a freedom fighter, and what, exactly, defines the difference? The Wachowski brothers think they know. Anyone who gives thought to the matter may respond with one of their screenplay's favorite words: Bollocks.
Still, there's more on this movie's mind than the usual wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am the trailers are promising. In adapting the groundbreaking early-'80s comic book series by writer Alan Moore and illustrator David Lloyd (since collected in paperback; it's well worth the read), Andy and Larry Wachowski of "The Matrix" fame are betting that multiplex audiences are ready for a propulsive Orwellian drama disguised as an action flick. They've made a mainstream provocation at a time when we could use one -- even a muddled one -- and for that, they should probably be thanked.
Ever the prickly iconoclast, Moore has had his name removed from the film, but while "V for Vendetta" makes many changes to his story line, it does no essential violence to the work as a whole. A mysterious figure known only as V (Hugo Weaving) still rises from his shadowy lair to visit butt-kicking death upon various minions of the state: a bombastic right-wing TV host (Roger Allam), an archbishop (John Standing) with a thing for young girls.
V still wears a mask that evokes both Guy Fawkes (who plotted to blow up Parliament in 1605) and Edmund Dantes, the count of Monte Cristo. He still takes under his wing a fearful young woman named Evey (Natalie Portman) and teaches her to see the true enemy (he gets her to take the red pill, in other words), and he still talks a mellifluous blue streak that worked better on the page.
There's a good-hearted policeman named Finch (Stephen Rea), who with his loyal assistant (Rupert Graves) works to uncover V's grim back story against the advice of head fingerman Creedy (Tim Pigott-Smith) and Sutler himself. The trail leads to a secret experimental camp and a rueful lady scientist played touchingly by Sinead Cusack. It also leads to images of human bodies steamrollered into pits and covered with quicklime. The Wachowskis are playing with the gloves off.
In point of fact, the brothers have only produced and written "V for Vendetta," handing the directorial reins to "Matrix" assistant director James McTeigue. Regardless of who did what, the movie's a handsome piece of work, dramatically powerful even when it backs into silliness. The strongest sequences are lifted almost intact from the comic: the imprisonment and torture that harden Evey while freeing her soul, a flashback to the sad story of Valerie Banks (Natasha Wightman), 
movie star and victim of the state.
Even while the movie is set in a post-apocalyptic day after tomorrow -- America, we're told, has fallen into chaos after the war it started enveloped the world -- its concerns are of the moment. Specifically: What rights might a terrified populace give up in the name of promised safety, and how might a government wield that fear to its advantage? Some will praise or condemn the movie's message as an attack on Bush-ism run amok (Alan Moore was responding to Margaret Thatcher, actually), but that's too easy. The real villain is a cowed and lazy citizenry. Meaning all of us.
Disappointingly, "V for Vendetta" makes this point early and moves on, at some point turning as shallow as what it protests against. (Let's pause to remember, for one thing, that Fawkes wanted to blow up Parliament so he could install a Catholic king on the throne. Freedom for the masses wasn't high on his to-do list.) The film comes close to being the inspired piece of agit-pop it's aiming for, and the performances are first-rate: Portman, both with hair and without, atones for the woodenness of Queen Amidala, and Weaving -- well, he gives good voice behind that mask.
In the end, though, the Wachowskis' love of freedom -- of, in Moore's words, that 1 inch no one can ever take from us -- is trumped by their love of watching things go boom. Spoiler alert (except to those who've been following news of the movie over the last few months): "V for Vendetta" ends with the destruction of the Houses of Parliament -- conveniently empty, unlike the London underground trains and buses of July 7, 2005. The movie offers this as an intentionally controversial celebratory sequence, after which the faceless crowds stand revealed at last in their beautiful individuality.
That's a bravura image, yet you're forgiven if you find yourself pondering the individuality of real-life victims. Shortly after the planes smashed into the World Trade towers five years ago -- after my daughter had come home from her Brooklyn school clutching a burnt memo that had blown across the river -- I wrote that I hoped never again to see a movie in which buildings blew up. I was referring to an Arnold Schwarzenegger film, but charges of irresponsibility can apply to a movie of ideas as well, if those ideas are glib. "V for Vendetta" says that terrorism's OK as long as no one really gets hurt, and to believe that, you need the wishful thinking of a child. Unfortunately, the world has grown up since Alan Moore set pen to paper. One wonders if the fan-boys ever will.

Comic-book superhero movies almost always hijack reality, reducing cinema to a state of pure, uncut escapism. You could hardly level that accusation, though, against V for Vendetta . Written and produced by Andy and Larry Wachowski, the creators of the Matrix  trilogy, who based it on the graphic novel by Alan Moore and David Lloyd, this bombs-away delirious avenger fantasy is set in a police-state Britain that draws elements from 1984 but, mostly, from the post-9/11 world, and it pushes its topical relevance in your face  that is, when it's not hitting you over the head with it, or bashing you in the solar plexus.
In V for Vendetta , the United States, reeling from a misguided war of dominion, has ceded the centrality of its global power back to Britain, whose ruler, Chancellor Sutler (John Hurt), looms Big Brother-like on oversize video screens, backed by a flag done in neo-Nazi red and black. (Can you say, bad guy?) As his scowling backup minister plots in the shadows (can you say, Dick Cheney?), the anchorpeople on the British Television Network report what the government tells them to, as the populace  a nation of couch potatoes  drink in the media lies that no one pretends to believe. Citizens are covered in hoods and subjected to torture (Abu Ghraib, anyone?), and if that doesn't sound overheated enough, there's a priest with a taste for young flesh, a popular bushy-browed TV demagogue who's like Bill O'Reilly crossed with Nixon, and a pointed allusion to Timothy McVeigh's homemade fertilizer bomb. Did I mention that the hero is an apocalyptic terrorist?
Known as V, he first shows up, all cutthroat eloquence and whirling, flying blades, like a merry-prankster Zorro, just in time to save the innocent Evey (Natalie Portman) from arrest  or worse  by state policemen. Dressed in black, with a cape, shiny gloves, and squared-off cap, plus a wig of flowing ebony hair that wouldn't look out of place on Bettie Page, V wears a mask that he never takes off  a grinning ceramic visage of Guy Fawkes, the 17th-century British anarchist hero, with pink cheeks and eyebrows raised in delight. It's like a Halloween mask of the Joker, but when this joker speaks, the words flow out in a velvety aristocratic purr  a gush of moral indignation. V, played sensationally by Hugo Weaving, is a droll and charming devil-doll. He's also a bit twee, given to soaring flights of alliteration and a few too many Shakespeare quotes.
The first-time director, James McTeigue, may have been influenced by the one inspired touch in Eyes Wide Shut : the spooky surrealism of a mask that ''talks.'' Jamming the signal at the BTN studios, V asks for the citizens of England to rise up and join him in annihilating Parliament. As we listen to his lofty call to arms, it's hard not to hear an overtone of Osama bin Laden, and for a few moments the film seems inspired in the daring of its off-kilter sympathy. But once V gets Evey in his underground lair, bursting with old paintings and a jukebox that plays Julie London singing ''Cry Me a River,'' you realize you're on far more familiar turf than you thought. A disfigured monster-saint seeking vengeance through action, V is Batman crossed with the Phantom of the Opera with a touch of the killer from Scream .
As a fix of pop iconography, V for Vendetta  is eyeball grabbing, even if it lacks the relentless videogame bravura that sold the Matrix  films. As a movie, however, it's merely okay, with a pivotal dramatic weakness: Evey, for all the attentions of her revolutionary Svengali, remains, in essence, a bystander, and Portman, her head shaved, plays her like Joan of Arc as a tremulous Girl Scout. There's one startling sequence in which the chancellor's fake appearance on a variety show becomes a black-as-midnight Benny Hill sketch. There's also a down-the-rabbit-hole flourish  it has to do with Evey's confinement and torture  that would bend your mind a lot more if the film did what it appears, for a moment, to be doing: cast V in a morally ambiguous light. But he remains the saintliest of guerrillas, a Batman who realizes Gotham is too dirty to be cleaned up and must be blown up instead.
Will audiences follow him, cheering the implicit detonation of America's institutions? Or will they find it all a bit...jejune? Coming out of V for Vendetta , a friend of mine called it ''radical'' and ''subversive.'' He was awestruck with disbelief that a film with a harlequin terrorist as its hero could actually be released by a major American studio. I was awestruck at his naïveté in a world where fight-the-power anarchy is now marketed as a fashionable identity statement  by the corporations that helped raise a generation on bands like Rage Against the Machine, by the armchair-leftist bloggers who flog the same righteousness day after day. V for Vendetta  has a playful-demon vitality, but it's designed to let political adolescents of every age congratulate themselves. It's rage against the machine by the machine.

 Thumb suckers of the world unite, the most hotly anticipated film of the, er, week, "V for Vendetta," has arrived, complete with manufactured buzz and some apparently genuine British outrage. Concocted by the same team behind the "Matrix" franchise, this future-shock story about a masked avenger at war with a totalitarian British regime was drawn along the usual Orwellian lines but is clearly meant to have more than a passing resemblance to our  current  political environment.  Is the man in the mask who wants to make Parliament go boom Osama bin Laden or  Patrick Henry?  Or just a Phantom of the Opera clone who likes to kick back to the cult sounds of Antony and the Johnsons? Your guess is as good as mine, and I've seen the film.  Written by Alan Moore and illustrated by David Lloyd, "V for Vendetta" originated as a limited comic series in the early 1980's,   just around the time that  Margaret Thatcher was re-elected for the second of three terms. Like the comic, the film is set in a near future, though now the time stamp is circa 2020. America, glimpsed only in passing on television, is paralyzed by  civil unrest, having unleashed worldwide havoc;  Britain has fallen to fascism; no word yet, though, on Luxembourg.  The usual totalitarian hard line prevails (no  dissent, no diversity,  no fun) as does the usual movie-villain aesthetic. The shock troops wear basic black with crimson accents, while the leader, played by John Hurt in a goatee drizzled with spit, parts his hair like Hitler.  The film, which follows Mr. Moore's story in broad outline, updating it with dead-end allusions to Islam, was adapted to the screen by Andy and Larry Wachowski and directed by one of their former assistant directors, James McTeigue. (Notably,  Mr. Moore is having nothing to do with the film.)  One night after curfew, a young woman, Evey (Natalie Portman, looking and sounding all of 12), is saved from an assault by a man in a Guy Fawkes mask who introduces himself as V (Hugo Weaving, wasted under his costume). V slices and dices Evey's troubles away, topping off his handiwork first by reciting some vacuous verse and then by blowing up the Old Bailey. She's perplexed, but like any impressionable youngster with daddy issues and no money for therapy, she's also interested. One thing leads to another and,  V for voilà, a minor league of extraordinary soul mates is born.  Mr. Moore's pretensions to seriousness may be seriously pretentious, but he seeks to elevate the level of conversation that has been inevitably lowered by the screen adaptations of his work. "V for Vendetta" is the worst offender in this regard, largely because the Wachowskis come equipped with their own fancy reading list and set of narrative and ideological imperatives.  Not long after V rescues Evey, she returns the favor, only to end up on the most-wanted list, chased by the police (meaning, for the most part, Stephen Rea). Far from the prying eyes and ears of state surveillance, V brings Evey back to his digs, a bachelor pad tricked out with movie posters, books, a Francis Bacon painting and Julie London pleading "Cry Me a River." All that's missing is a shag carpet and Miss July.  Despite his kinky getup, V has other things on his mind than ravaging his house guest — like watching the 1934 chestnut "The Count of Monte Cristo" with Evey while curled up on the couch. Mr. Moore's story owes much to the Dumas (père) novel about a wrongly imprisoned commoner turned wealthy  avenger, but it differs significantly in how it puts vengeance and man over forgiveness and God, and more or less jettisons the love angle. Unlike the Count, V remains a lone avenging angel to the big-bang end, which does help give this sluggish affair a much-needed resuscitating jolt. Made mostly  on sound stages and  computers, with 3-D   models doubling for monuments, the film looks and sounds as canned as a Buck Rogers serial, though this weighs in less like a conscious aesthetic strategy than a function of poor technique.  Mr. McTeigue, who probably received some guidance from the Wachowskis (they also served as producers), never manages to make this Goth dystopia pop. Like the last two installments of the "Matrix" cycle, this film sags when it should zip, weighted down with self-importance and some dubious thinking.  The Wachowskis appear deeply enamored  of the great (super) man theory of history, with mysterioso leaders who are intent on delivering the rest of us from false consciousness. Given this, it's no surprise that the geopolitical terrain staked out in this film skews so last century: globalization having been given the jackboot, partly, one imagines, because  multinational capitalism, with its total market value and shareholder wealth, doesn't register as cool as all that shiny, shiny leather and crypto-Nazi styling.  Then again, the idea that revolution can come from the ground up doesn't jibe with the great director theory of film history, either. One of the more interesting things about Mr. Moore's comic, along with V's contradictions and cartoon dialectics ("anarchy wears two faces," V intones), is how many different characters take possession of the story at different times.  The screenplay, by contrast, essentially carves the plot into two parallel narrative strands — V and Evey occupy one, the fascists and their henchmen the other — that eventually twist together as predictably as in any blockbuster blowout. Working in a medium and at a scale that allows him to conceptualize outside the lines, Mr. Moore wags his finger at the masses, blaming them for their dire straits, but he also hands much of the story over to them.  Initially scheduled to be released in November  2005, to coincide with Guy Fawkes Day, the film was delayed in the wake of the July bombing attacks in London. Since then, inevitable questions and objections have been raised about whether "V for Vendetta" turns a terrorist into a hero, which is precisely what it does do. Predictably, the filmmakers, actors and media savants have floated the  familiar formulation that one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter, as if this actually explained anything about how terror and power (never mind movies) work.  The more valid question is how anyone who isn't 14 or under could possibly mistake a corporate bread-and-circus entertainment like this for something subversive. You want radical? Wait for the next Claire Denis film.  "V for Vendetta" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Less violent than might be expected, the film includes bloody sword violence, sadistic torture and intimations of pedophilia.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

Although often visually striking and undercoated by a compelling sci-fi concept, graphic-novel adaptation "V for Vendetta" feels flat as a storyboard. Chiming faintly with current counterculture vibe in higher-browed films, dystopian "Vendetta" posits a masked "terrorist" hero (Hugo Weaving) trying to overthrow a fascist state in future Blighty. Helmed by James McTeigue, pic suffers from many of same problems as last two installments of producers Andy and Larry Wachowski's "Matrix" franchise: indigestible dialogue, pacing difficulties and too much pseudo-philosophical info. Pic should open with a bang in late March but may fizzle quickly.
Alan Moore, the author of the much admired graphic novel "V for Vendetta," disassociated himself from this production and had his name removed from the credits. This should make his fan base extra wary, especially since two critically panned pics ("From Hell," "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen") have already been hatched from options sold on Moore's work.
Plot differs substantially from the written version, which was issued complete as a graphic novel in 1989. Simplified movie version, penned by the Wachowski brothers, gamely tries to retain key plot points that will serve as mass market entertainment, while half-heartedly updating Moore's allegorical digs at Thatcher's Britain in the '80s to reflect current leftist fears about what a future totalitarian state might repress -- not just homosexuality but Islam, too.
Brit auds, however, may feel pic has missed a trick by not taking a sharper swipe at Tony Blair's regime.
Opening prologue shows Guy Fawkes, the Catholic conspirator who tried to blow up Parliament in 1605 and whose "treason" is remembered every Nov. 5 in the U.K. with fireworks displays.
Post-credits, story shifts to 2020, after worldwide unrest, mysterious deadly viral outbreaks and fear have caused the populace to elect a neo-fascist state, run by demagogic Chancellor Adam Sutler (John Hurt).
On Nov. 4, TV station gopher Evey (Natalie Portman) is saved from a gang of Fingermen, thuggish quasi-police agents intent on raping her, by V (Weaving), a poetry-spouting, caped avenger wearing a Guy Fawkes mask, who at midnight blows up the Old Bailey, London's central criminal court.
The government tries to spin the explosion, but V breaks into the station where Evey works and manages to get his revolutionary, anti-Sutler message broadcast, promising to blow up Parliament in exactly a year's time. While at the station, he also saves Evey from two coppers, Finch (Stephen Rea) and his sidekick Dominic (Rupert Graves), who've come to arrest her.
Pic next metronymically crosscuts between V killing off various characters who wronged him, and Finch and Dominic investigating the murders, which leads to lots of explicatory flashbacks.
Thesping lineup offers an embarrassment of riches, which, unfortunately, the weak helming by McTeigue rather squanders. Bambi-eyed Portman cries affectingly, and looks fetching with a shaved head, but her character is essentially passive and not especially interesting. (Portman's accent also wavers distractingly across classes, from Cockney to middle-England posh.)
Meanwhile, the film suffers as its most active character, V, is hidden behind a mask and helmeted with one of Cher's old Cleopatra-style wigs for almost the entire running time. Weaving tries hard with voice and movement to add expression, but there's still nearly zero chemistry between the leads.
Supports, cast predictably, are mostly just OK. Sinead Cusack as one of V's victims manages to register one of pic's few moments of emotional complexity.
Helming debutant McTeigue cites in press notes that 1965's "The Battle of Algiers" was one of the film's stylistic inspirations, but evidence here suggests he may be thinking of an entirely imaginary film that bears no relation to that docudrama classic.
Perhaps helmer thinks that the trite cutaways in "Vendetta" to stereotypically ordinary Brits roused by V's message bear some likeness to the fervid mix of minor characters in Gillo Pontecorvo's film.
In the end, competent but bland craft contributions ensure pic looks less like sci-fi stalwarts "A Clockwork Orange" and "Fahrenheit 451" and more like "Batman Begins" or "Van Helsing."
Action sequences are serviceable but disappointing given the Wachowski pedigree, the most striking being the final carve-up between V and a room full of heavies. Pic is thankfully light on CGI work and gets its most rousing moments from old-fashioned pyrotechnics and, of all things, a huge domino cascade.

Adapted by the Wachowski brothers and helmed by their Matrix  assistant director James McTeigue from Alan Moore 's graphic novel, V for Vendetta  is a most provocative piece of pulp fiction. You can bet there won't be many other movies at the multiplex extolling anarchist terror.
V for Vendetta , which opens March 16, is nothing if not topical in its fantasies. The action is set in a totalitarian London dominated by fake news and ruled through xenophobic panic. Historically, however, the movie takes a longer view. A pre-credit sequence walks through the 17th-century Gunpowder Plot, in which Guy Fawkes  and a cabal of Catholic fanatics hid 36 barrels of explosives beneath Parliament to blow the British government to kingdom come. England's not-quite 9-11 (a pretext for a crackdown on Catholics and foreigners), this thwarted conspiracycelebrated every year as Guy Fawkes Dayhas an even more hysterical significance. Had it been successful, the explosion would have vaporized half of London and thus, in its state-of-the-art carnage, offered a foretaste of Hiroshima .
Supremely tasteless, V for Vendetta , with the mysterious V (Hugo Weaving ) haunting London in an insouciantly smiling Guy Fawkes mask, was scheduled to have its premiere last November on the day of the Plot's 400th anniversary. The opening was delayed out of deference to last summer's London subway bombings, as well it might have been. What's remarkable about the Wachowski scenario, as opposed to Moore's original, is the degree to which it stands Fawkes on his headrecuperating this protosuicide bomber as a figure of revolt. (Moore, incidentally, has disassociated himself from the film.)
A movie of multitudinous comic book tropes, V for Vendetta  is predicated on secret identities, floridly alliterative dialogue, and gnomic bromides: "There are no coincidences, only the illusion of coincidence," V grandly explains. In other words, it's all about the plot. (McTeigue's pedestrian mise-en-scéne is elaborate without being particularly detailed.) Like the movie in which he dwells, V is partial to 19th-century fictions like The Count of Monte Cristo , even as his social function is grotesquely hyper-contemporary. Name and origin unknown, V is blank slate and screen for projection. V for Vigilante.
V is orchestrating, literally, his own gunpowder plot. With his mocking fixed grin, this political superhero plays Joker to his own Batman. V's full-face disguise recalls the ski masks of the Italian Red Brigades; his slashing trademark is a recognizable permutation on the anarchist "A." This empty signifier argues for terror as a semiotician mightan attack on symbolsand he paraphrases Emma Goldman  on the revolutionary importance of dancing. His subterranean museum of solitude boasts a Wurlitzer  jukebox. A romantic, he's partial to Julie London 's "Cry Me a River."
Moore's stories appeared throughout the '80s, conflating Thatcherite Britain and Orwell's dystopia, imagining a postWorld War III regime founded on racial purity, sexual conformity, and Nazi-style concentration camps. The Wachowskis tweak this premise to tweak the U.S. It's 2020, the year of perfect vision, and to no one's disappointment, America has collapsed in chaos. Awash in secret detention camps and biological weapons (including avian flu), the U.K. is a Muslim-phobic fascist state (Koran consigned to the Ministry of Objectionable Material ) ruled by a fascist Chancellor who came to power in a biological Reichstag Fire.

V and Evey meet cute when he saves her from police gang rape. Other forms of social control include a snarling Bill O'Reilly  type known as the Voice of London. His opposite number (Stephen Fry ) is a subversive chat show host who ridicules the Chancellor and pays the price for his music hall stunt. Clearly, the Wachowskis have not entirely abandoned the idea of the Matrix. When V blows up London's central criminal court, Old Bailey , the fake news goes into major damage control, bragging that it was an intentional demolition job. Fog City is so shrouded in conspiracy that, in tracking down the mystery terrorist, the government's hangdog investigator (Stephen Rea ) has no alternative but to investigate himself.

If The Matrix  betrayed the Wachowskis' acquaintance with Jean Baudrillard , V for Vendetta  suggests they've been perusing political philosopher Antonio Negri both the old ultra-left Negri of Domination and Sabotage  and the new Michael Hardt collaborating Negri of Empire and Multitude . (The latter book even name-dropped The Matrix  as an example of how Empire feeds on the creative "social productivity" of the ruled.) V's dictum that "people shouldn't be afraid of their government, the government should be afraid of its people"is a Cracker Jack box restatement of Negri and Hardt's notion of democracy for all. And the theorists would surely approve of V as the antithesis of a Leninist revolutionary elite.
