If nothing else, this adaptation of Peter Mayle's umpteenth ode to livin' la vie en Provence will make you wonder about Ridley Scott and the directorial aging process. This isn't to say Scott is lying down on the job � no more than Mayle could be accused of cush'n it through the vineyards and ch�teaux of Southern France, anyway (no fool he) � but simply that it is difficult to reconcile this film with the director who made the bleak confections The Duelists
, Alien
, and Blade Runner
. (None of these films, to my memory, featured such a languid pace, so much gustatory deliciousness, or Russell "Put My Call Through Or I'll Brain You" Crowe in a sleeveless V-neck pullover with navy blue piping.) There's nary a trace of doom throughout, unless you count Finney's epicurian Uncle Henry, who cedes his ch�teau in Provence to beloved nephew Max Skinner (Crowe). In the time it's taken Max to grow up and move to London, the boy has grown into a louche, selfish, entirely unsympathetic trader of bonds, prone to duplicity, and nothing at all like the brainy young pipsqueak Henry entertained all those summers ago with diluted wines culled from his own vineyards. It's absolutely no surprise then when Max flies to France with the aim of selling the ch�teau for a quick million or 5 and ends up falling in love (with Cotillard's brilliantly named bistro owner, Fanny, and good God, man, what's not to love?) and coming to realize the error of his Western, pedestrian ways. As it stands, there are precious few surprises in A Good Year
 � its story, like its garden paths, is well-trod and familiar. It's also quite charming, in its way, a divertissement of no particular offense other than, perhaps, pushing audience buttons, notably those marked "Quit Day Job, Move to Provence." Which, quite frankly, sounds like a lovely idea.


"A Good Year" is a sun-drenched fantasy about the power of wine, women, and Provence to cure whatever ails us, and it is no deeper than a bowl of consommé. And what of it? Movies are fantasy, too, and when a craftsman like director Ridley Scott and a gloomy Oscar-winning gus like Russell Crowe decide to take a vacation, it can be time off for us all.
Based on a novel by Peter Mayle -- who for 15 years now has been selling Provence to the masses like shrink-wrapped ham -- the new movie is a shamelessly enjoyable retread, an ode to la belle vie
 that has been well turned on a factory spindle.
Plus, there's the pleasure of seeing Crowe lighten his load for once and not carry the weight of Marlon Brando on his shoulders. The actor even goes in for a little slapstick here, and while it's hardly convincing -- it's like watching a Brahma bull trying to tap dance -- you appreciate the effort.
When we first meet Max Skinner (Crowe), he's a British master of the universe, a currency trader who's happy to break a gentleman's agreement if there's profit to be had. (Actually, he does it for the sheer joy of being mean.) Max has it all -- a fast-track career, a devoted assistant (Archie Punjabi), willowy women by the boxcar -- but is he really happy? If you answer yes, you don't get out of the house enough.
In flashback, we've seen young Max at play in the French vineyards of his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney), an aging rapscallion who pegs the kid as his proper heir in knavery. Freddie Highmore, the heart-wrencher of "Finding Neverland" and "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," plays Crowe as a boy, and he instinctively gets the ego and the quickness of the future man -- the love of getting one over on another person. Lord, is this kid good.
Back in modern-day England, Max gets word that Henry has died and left the Provence estate to him; he reluctantly leaves his London kingdom and crosses the Channel to sell the place. Cue the birdsong, the swoony Franche 
music, and a lighting change from cold blues to deep, honeyed ambers. Seriously, the yellow-filter budget for "A Good Year" probably cost more than all of "Little Miss Sunshine."
At this point, Scott and company just stop and smell the lavender. "Year" crawls to a halt while Max investigates the fruits of his vineyard -- it tastes like battery acid, unfortunately -- jousts with the slovenly estate caretaker (Didier Bourdon), and drinks in the sight of the local femmes
. The film's big joke is that there isn't a shabby-looking woman in the entire province and that beauty is encoded among them at the genetic level. The men, of course, are free to look like swine.
Indeed, this veers close to piggery -- or, at the very least, to a talented British director going heavy on the ooh-la-la -- but the sight of actress Marion Cotillard as a local restaurateur puts a stop to all complaints. She is simply, elegantly, meltingly lovely, and there's not a thing you can do about it.
"A Good Year" piles on the complications without reaching the dizzying RPM necessary for farce; that would be too much work. A young American woman named Christie (Australian actress Abbie Cornish, from "Somersault") turns up claiming to be Henry's illegitimate daughter, and Max has to decide whether to welcome this potential cousin, scare her off, or seduce her. Yes, that's a little creepy but Scott doesn't seem to notice and, anyway, we're quickly off to the next meal, the next bottle, the next sunset.
The film is about the magic of letting a place get to you -- changing your rhythms and thought patterns -- and it has the glow of a second week at the beach, when you finally shake off your old life. The story line is utterly predictable and utterly beside the point; Scott and Crowe are after the ripeness of atmosphere.
So the star's performance hangs on the film like grapes on the vine; the way Crowe plays it, Max's delight in financial piracy has merely been diverted toward the things one can touch: soil, the curve of a bottle or of a woman's shoulder. If "Sideways" was about life's bitter aftertaste, "A Good Year" is about savoring the first swallow. Both movies are comedies; this one's just cheaper and easier to drink. Maybe it is travel-poster porn, but it's November now, and the afternoons are dark. There are worse things to sell than hedonism.


         Figuring out why director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe were happy as can be to make "A Good Year" is not difficult. What's harder to come up with are compelling reasons to see it.
 
  Director Scott not only owns a vineyard in the gorgeous Luberon region of Provence, where "A Good Year" is set, he is a good friend of Peter Mayle, who also lives in Provence and wrote the novel the film is based on. More than that, Scott gave Mayle the idea for the book. "This shoot," the director says, "was one of my most pleasant experiences."
 


         






    Crowe, who got to live in the area for two months, says, "I loved waking up in Provence." Also not complaining was screenwriter Marc Klein, who, according to the press notes, spent "almost a year researching the region and the wines." Not exactly the assignment from hell.
 
  No one is begrudging these hard-working movie-land professionals some time in the sun. It would've been nice, however, if more of the pleasure they experienced translated onto the movie screen, but little of it does. Though "A Good Year" is set in French wine country, it's best described as small beer. The scenery may be attractive and the cast likewise, but something vital is missing in this all-too-leisurely film, just as there is in the overly hectic life of protagonist Max Skinner, played by Crowe.
 
  Our Max is a London investment banker, a master of the universe who manipulates markets and tells his minions, "We're not here for the dental plan." He's an emotionless, self-satisfied moneymaking machine who is about to find out that even mountains of cash can't always buy you what you need.
 
  That's right, "A Good Year" is one of those ever-popular movies in which impossibly rich people, clueless about what really matters, turn out to be incapable of enjoying the simple things in life. As if.
 
  Undeterred by his status as a cliche, Max is unmoved by a letter telling him that his favorite Uncle Henry has died and left him the château and vineyard in the midst of glorious Provence, where he spent summers as a boy. Max decides to go over and have a quick look before selling the place and making a killing.
 
  This cold plan notwithstanding, a series of flashbacks to our hero as a child ("Finding Neverland's" Freddie Highmore) tells us that Max had more of a connection to Uncle Henry (Albert Finney at his most garrulous) than he wants to admit. Once Max arrives at the La Siroque vineyard and reconnects with its cranky winemaker Francis (Didier Bourdon) and his coquettish wife, Ludivine (Isabelle Candelier), the memories of golden childhood moments gradually come flooding back.
 
  If this isn't conventional enough, Max has a predictable cute-meet with the most beautiful woman in town, the lovely Fanny Chenal (Marion Cotillard, Cesar winner for "A Very Long Engagement"), nearly running her down on her bicycle while he's reading a map as he drives his car. Despite this promising beginning, however, Max is soon informed that "it is rumored she will let no man near her heart." Quelle dommage!
 
 
Also a problem is that the wine La Siroque produces appears to be dreadful, hampering that much desired sale. An additional obstacle is the sudden appearance of a fetching young woman-oenophile from California (Australia's Abbie Cornish) who claims to be Uncle Henry's illegitimate daughter and is saddled with such dreadful lines as, "Back in Napa we're known to gargle and spit on occasion."
 
  The fact that we know exactly what will happen to Max from the moment he appears on screen is not what's wrong with "A Good Year." After all, we go to films like this precisely because the satisfaction of emotional certainty is what we're looking for.
 
  What we're not looking for is a romantic comedy made by individuals with no special feeling for the genre who stretch a half hour's worth of story to nearly two hours. Russell Crowe is invariably involving on screen, and Ridley Scott is a splendid director when the material is right. No film they collaborate on will be devoid of interest, but "A Good Year" almost is. If Scott was, in his own words, "looking for an excuse to come back to France to shoot a film," it's a pity he didn't hold out for a project that would please audiences as well as himself.
 
 
 'A Good Year'

  In general release.   

He can deliver a knockout punch, command a ship of the line, or confound a corrupt Roman emperor while armed with little more than a handful of dust, but great Caesar's ghost, Russell Crowe can't do everything. In the tepid romantic comedy/travel brochure A Good Year , Crowe plays Hugh Grant  well, he plays one of those taken-for-Granted foppish Brits who start off insufferably cocky but end up redeemably charming through a series of delightfully self-deprecating comeuppances. And the result is not A Good Look for our Maximus. His idea of marketing what passes for his delightfully self-deprecating side involves, at one point, tumbling into an empty, sunken swimming pool with no escape ladder while a pretty lady smirks (in the days before she inevitably falls for him) above. Thud.
We are not entertained. His eyeglasses yuppie-horn-rimmed and his hair curlicued as if his hairdresser had used a Four Weddings and a Funeral  head shot for reference, Crowe plays Max Skinner, a ruthless, wheeler-dealing London bond trader who inherits a French chateau and vineyard from his late uncle. (In flashback, Albert  Finney rumbles and cavorts as the puckish bon vivant, instructing a receptive Freddie Highmore in gracious living and wine swirling as his young nephew, the mini Max.) And at first, Max is too type A to enjoy the bounty; in a bit of a cash-flow crunch, he wants to sell the joint ASAP . What, is Max the only guy in the English-speaking world who didn't read Peter Mayle's A Year in Provence  when the best-selling memoir came out back in 1990 and who didn't afterward covet the former adman's chateau-and-vineyard-owning, smug good fortune? Didn't he read Toujours Provence , or Hotel Pastis: A Novel of Provence , or Encore Provence: New Adventures in the South of France , or A Good Year  itself  all of them progressively less fresh Mayle fantasies, set in sun-kissed groves tended by wise, eccentric Gallic locals who do the hard work?
Apparently Max didn't  although director Ridley Scott certainly did. (Not that he needed to; Crowe's old Gladiator  general owns his own chateau and vineyard in the region, not far from Mayle's spread.) Of course, the slicked-up Londoner's hustle begins to melt under the Provençal sun. Business dealings keep him stuck in French paradise longer than he bargained for, during which time he is treated with fermented chagrin by the estate's winemaker (Didier Bourdon), meets a luscious local restaurant owner (French lovely Marion Cotillard, as the femme who witnesses his pool pratfall), and is visited by a golden California girl (Somersault 's succulent young Abbie Cornish, also on ample display soon in Candy ) who claims kinship, too: The late, lusty uncle may have been the father she never met.
A Good Year  (with a screenplay by Serendipity 's Marc Klein, based on Mayle's 2004 book) argues for inarguably good things. It's all for leisure and against stress, it's pro-food, -wine, -women, and -vacation homes, and it's opposed to thinking of Crowe only as a heavy with a flash temper, best suited to playing brawlers and brooders. (In a wink to past battles, Crowe's Max does indeed scoop up a handful of southern French loam and roll it through his fingers.)
But the movie is out of sync with the times  a desultory entertainment rote even in its ideas of beauty, set in a place that by now has been overharvested as a holiday destination, about a greed-is-good character type that has become a cliché (and worse, a joke), played in a light, heterosexual-male comedy style that by now looks like something out of the 19th century and was already wearing thin in the early 1990s when getting off the career treadmill and stopping to smell the grapevines was considered something new and marvelous in a man. Even Hugh Grant isn't doing the Hugh Grant shtick anymore, which makes Crowe's dutiful stomping around on the way to  sensual enlightenment all the more miscued.
I like the matchup of Scott and Crowe, two masters of masculine mise-en-scène who understand that nothing beats a big, dramatic (and commercially sound) swing of the bat, and whose aim is usually much better than this. So I'll assume that this project was more of a recuperative project in the sunshine for tightly scheduled director and tightly wound star than a serious cinematic collaboration. I'll write A Good Year  off as nothing more than a bad harvest.

 “A Good Year,” an innocuous, feel-good movie that reunites Russell Crowe with the director Ridley Scott, is a far cry from the triumphant metallic stomp of “Gladiator,” their previous collaboration. A sun-dappled romantic diversion, which one British critic has already dismissed as “tourist gastro-porn,” “A Good Year” is a three-P movie: pleasant, pretty and predictable. One might add piddling.  If nothing else, this celebration of French food and wine, adapted from Peter Mayle’s 2004 novel, will whet an  appetite for consuming “the nectar that is incapable of lying,” as the film’s dissipated philosopher of epicurean delights calls the product of his estate in Provence. Viewers are advised to make a reservation at an upscale French restaurant immediately after seeing the film or risk going home feeling deprived.  For Mr. Crowe, whose public image took a hit last year when he threw a telephone at a desk clerk in a New York hotel and later pleaded guilty to assault, “A Good Year” looks like a calculated charm offensive by an actor not known for his courtly manners. His character, Max Skinner, a ferociously aggressive London bond trader who inherits a small vineyard from his Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) and quickly mellows into a rich, happy, bon vivant, is the sort of role usually taken by Hugh Grant.  Mr. Crowe, estimable actor that he is, gives what may be his cheeriest screen performance. But is he charming? Let’s just say that both Grants (Hugh and the ghost of Cary) can rest comfortably. Mr. Crowe is not unlikable. But as for visceral charm, there are only flashes here and there.  For Mr. Scott “A Good Year” is one of his periodic palate cleansers. Amid his outpouring of would-be blockbusters — “Gladiator,” “Hannibal,” “Black Hawk Down” and “Kingdom of Heaven” — all released since 2000, only one other film, “Matchstick Men,” qualifies as a breather from a schedule that suggests the directorial equivalent of training for a heavyweight bout.  The blandness of “A Good Year” isn’t the fault of Mr. Scott, who pumps the film full of visual energy and gorgeous scenery, but of its screenwriter, Marc Klein (“Serendipity”). You keep waiting for some witty banter, but except for scattered remarks and Max’s slapstick tumble into an empty swimming pool, there isn’t much comedy.  The inevitable romance, when it arrives in the person of a French bistro owner, Fanny (Marion Cotillard), whom he covets at first sight, is a half-baked affair in which her chilly resistance thaws faster than ice cream in a microwave.  The movie begins, in its own coy language, “a few vintages ago” with a scene of Max as a boy (Freddie Highmore) frolicking on the estate of his snobbish, bibulous uncle. As this old man dispenses sartorial advice to his nephew, the cocky wunderkind beats him at chess. The story then shoots ahead “many vintages later” to catch the grown-up Max, now a preening Master of the Universe, as he spits fire in his London brokerage house and leads his “lab rats,” as he calls his troops, in an unscrupulous maneuver that nets his company tens of millions of dollars.  Word arrives that Max’s once-beloved Uncle Henry, with whom he lost touch years earlier, has died, leaving no will. As his uncle’s closest surviving relative, Max stands to inherit the estate, La Siroque, which he visits, determined to make a quick sale based on the advice of his best friend, Charlie Willis (Tom Hollander), a London real-estate agent. But once he arrives in France where the sun is brighter, the grapes tastier and the women more pliable, ooh la la! Before the property can be sold, it needs repairs, especially the tennis court, and he lingers there and begins to rediscover the simple pleasures of those halcyon childhood summers.  But even in paradise Max is prickly and insensitive. He repeatedly tramples on the feelings of his uncle’s winemaker (Didier Bourdon) and shouts “Lance Armstrong!” while driving past a group of French cyclists. Nice guy.  Out of the blue a young woman from California, Christie Roberts (Abbie Cornish), shows up and announces she is Uncle Henry’s illegitimate daughter. If her claim is true, she, not Max, would get La Siroque, whose value suddenly diminishes after a wine-growing expert tests the vines and pronounces restoration of the vineyard to its former glory impossible.  With two pretty women lurking around the premises, you might expect a rivalry to develop, but the movie barely considers the possibility. Failing that, you might expect Max and Christie to wage a cutthroat battle for ownership of the estate. But Christie, an oenophile from Napa Valley, is primarily interested in knowing more about her father.  Ms. Cornish (the young Australian actress who was so gripping in “Somersault”) exudes a palpable discomfort in her confusing, underwritten role.  “A Good Year” is the movie equivalent of poring over a glossy brochure for a luxury vacation you could never afford while a roughneck salesman (Mr. Crowe) who imagines he has class harangues you to hurry up and make a decision about taking the tour. My advice is to resist the pitch.  The movie is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language and one mild sex scene.

A light rose from Ridley Scott compared to the hefty cabernets he usually turns out, "A Good Year" is a divertissement
, an excuse for the filmmakers and cast to enjoy a couple of months in Provence and for the audience, by proxy, to spend a couple of hours there. A simple repast consisting of sometimes strained slapsticky comedy, a sweet romance and a life lesson learned, this little picnic doesn't amount to much but goes down easily enough to generate OK B.O. returns.
Story of a rapacious London bonds trader tempted to opt out of the fast lane for life at an inherited chateau is more than a bit self-referential for both Scott and the source book's author, Peter Mayle. The two worked together in the advertising and commercials world 30 years ago, with Mayle eventually giving it up to write books, beginning with the massively successful "A Year in Provence" in 1991. Scott also has a home and vineyard in the area.
So when the allure of the simple life is expressed here, it is only on the most fantastic terms, with the best wine, food, views and women already in place for instantaneous consumption. As a real-life fantasy it's hard to beat; as a film, it's an agreeable slice of lifestyles-of-the-rich voyeurism.
After a brief prologue devoted to conceited British boy Max (Freddie Highmore) being indoctrinated in the finer points of wine by his life-lusting Uncle Henry (Albert Finney) at the latter's estate in the south of France, Max (Russell Crowe) enters as an even more self-satisfied adult on the trading floor, finessing a fantastic profit in one session that raises the ire of his rivals.
Notified that his uncle has died and left him the chateau, he flies down to wrap up the paperwork to facilitate a quick sale of the property, which promises to net Max another small fortune. Heedless of the feelings of his uncle's longtime winemaker Francis (Didier Bourdon) and the latter's wife, Ludivine (Isabelle Candelier), Max cares about nothing but money and winning, and while in France relishes driving past a bunch of bicyclists and yelling gleefully at them "Lance Armstrong!"
Given that the estate's little dog is named Tati and that clips from "M. Hulot's Holiday" and "Mon Oncle" are glimpsed at one point, it's safe to assume Scott admires the great French comic filmmaker Jacques Tati. Along those lines, Crowe takes quite a few pratfalls in the course of the film, including one into a waterless swimming pool with walls too high to climb up, a predicament that allows him to begin his sparring match with lovely local restaurant owner Fanny (Marion Cotillard), who's sworn off men.
Rather than for its more rambunctious physicality, pic is often more appealing in its throwaway asides, such as the one in the pool when a filthy Max mincingly mutters the famous lines from "Lawrence of Arabia" about why Lawrence likes the desert: "It's clean. I like it because it's clean."
A convenient job suspension keeps Max in Provence longer than planned, long enough for the place to cast its spell upon him. One surprise is the arrival of Christie (Abbie Cornish), a beautiful girl from Napa coming to meet her biological father -- none other than the deceased Henry -- for the first time. French laws allowing claims of illegitimate children throw the inheritance into question, while the mystery surrounding the source of a very pricey vin de garage
, as opposed to the lousy stuff openly grown on the property, gives Max further pause.
But in a story like this, it can only be a woman who makes the blind man see the light. And so it is when Max and Fanny, two young but hard souls -- who, they figure out, once met as children on the land -- finally come together in an endearing breakthrough scene extremely well played by Crowe and Cotillard. For a moment, pic approaches a level of genuine intoxication.
His hair smoothed and straightened into something like a 1920s look, and outfitted with glasses much of the time, Crowe executes a lightweight change of pace with his charisma entirely intact, even if he still hasn't mastered an English accent that fits comfortably with Finney's or Highmore's. There are moments when the enchanting Cotillard resembles a Gallic, dark-haired Reese Witherspoon, and Aussie thesp Cornish, in her first Hollywood film, continues her quick ascent with a perfect Yank accent and a nice note of observant reserve.
The setting could hardly be made to look less than glorious, and production standards are up to what one expects from a Scott picture. All the same, lensing is not as resplendent as it might have been; numerous shots sharing bright and dark areas aren't well balanced, and faces are sometimes underlit. The soundtrack, fleshed out with an eclectic array of tunes, is lively.

Pity Max Skinner , emasculated over his lamb chops. On a gray afternoon, at London's hot spot du jour, his gloating superior unveils a plot to poach his most lucrative client, divesting him of a six- figure bonus (pounds sterling) in the process. Fuck it. The bummed-out bond trader hands in a resignation letter and the keys to his company BMW . "Better to die on your feet than live on your knees," Max reflects, happy to be done with his meddlesome boss, if less than pleased to reacquaint himself with "the face of public transport."
Yet all is not lost for our haute- bourgeois hero! There remains a letter, lately delivered from a notary in Provence, bearing news of an inheritance from his departed uncle Henry: the shabby-chic château where he summered as a lad, vineyard and caretakers included. So off Max jets to exile in frogville, there to be met by walking clichés (the gruff yet tender groundskeeper, the hysterically vivacious housekeeper) and a terrible new dilemma: the succulent notary, the tasty waitress, or perhaps his fresh-faced American cousin, paying an unexpected visit with her bright white teeth and murky claim on his inheritance? "In France, is it illegal to shag your cousin?" he asks of a friend. "Only if she's ugly."
Such is the setup of Peter Mayle 's novel A Good Year , the perfect diversion for misogynistic investment bankers whose personal assistants neglected to pack the new issue of Vanity Fair   in their Vuitton  weekenders. Soon to be ignored at a multiplex near you, the film version arrives courtesy of screenwriter Marc Klein  and that unsurpassed master of the effervescent rom-com, Sir Ridley Scott . A third-act intrigue concerning the provenance of an exceptionally rare, hideously expensive wine has been eliminated, with the focus now shifted, aimlessly, on the primitive life lessons learned by Max (Russell Crowe ). Will he come to appreciate the simple things in life? You know, like sleeping in, luxuriating on the terrace, and resisting the urge to destroy people? Max will be helped in these matters by the affections of the egregiously named waitress Fanny Chenal (Marion Cotillard ), "Pussy Dior" having presumably been trademarked for an upcoming Bond Girl.
And so pretty people do lovely things in picturesque locales rendered weirdly oppressive by the filmmakers, whose penchant for macho, wide-angle pans is married to an astonishing ability to deploy the famed southern light like a weapon of mass saturationrich golden sunlight, like a bullion bar chucked at your face. Nevertheless, the climate seems to agree with Crowe, whose performance is humdrum yet palpably relaxed, at least when he isn't made to talk with a mouthful of crackers in some tragic attempt at levity. Scott can do mayhem, dystopia, and the rampaging alien (extraterrestrial, android, Somali, Demi Moore ) with the best of them, but the breezy touch is not his forte. A Good Year just about peaks in comedic invention when a Jack Russell terrier named Tati pees on Max's loafer.
A Good Year is the greatest miscalculation in a career that includes Hannibal , but Scott's  motivation for adapting this insipid holiday porn may be explained by (a) his desire to rest between the heavy lifting of Kingdom of Heaven and the forthcoming American Gangster ;  (b) the proximity it would afford to his 11-hectare estate in Provence; and (c) it was his stupid idea in the first place.
Mayle first made his name in London advertising circles at the same time Scott was establishing his credentials in TV commercials ("pocket versions of feature films," he has called them, encapsulating his philosophy of cinema). A friendship was born, and some years later, auteur shared with author a newspaper clipping about the phenomena of "garage wines," über-exclusive vintages that sell for astronomical prices. None of that Sideways  philosophizing about the spirit of the grape for these two. "They are not mere bottles of liquid," writes Mayle, "they are investments ."
A Good Year  offers little return on your own $10 investment beyond the spectacle of Scott misplacing his talents. Sir Sourpuss is profoundly ill suited to shill for the good life, unless it be to stage its destruction, and yet A Good Year  isn't wholly uncharacteristic. Uptight and vapid, bursting with spectacular landscapes and virtuoso production design, it lacks only a horde of bloodthirsty Visigoths to fit seamlessly into the oeuvre. He has done what he can. A throwaway line in the novel about warding off scorpions with dried lavender has been expanded so that every other character must fend off an attack. A Year in Provence: The Conquest of Paradise!
