It Might Get Loud  is a marvelous rock doc that manages to be wistful, tasty, and jam-kicking at the same time. In a high summit of electric-guitar fetishism, director Davis Guggenheim unites  and tells the separate stories of  three six-string wizards: Jimmy Page, the virtuoso fuzz-box classicist of Led Zeppelin, who is now an elegant moon-faced gentleman; The Edge, U2's mad scientist of sonic jangle, who shows you some of his tricks; and Jack White, the low-tech hell-raiser of the White Stripes, here to pay homage and also  to represent, you know,  the kids. The result is pure candy for the guitar hero in all of us.


 Some documentaries — “Soul Power” is an excellent recent example — immerse the viewer in the sensory spectacle of a live performance. Others, like “Anvil: The Story of Anvil,” acquaint us with the lives and personalities of performers. “It Might Get Loud,” a new film directed by Davis Guggenheim (“An Inconvenient Truth”), is more unusual. It’s a group portrait of three musicians and also, more intriguingly, a free-form historical and philosophical essay on the instrument that unites them.  The mystique of the electric guitar is as durable as anything in rock ’n’ roll. Whenever the power chord or the screaming solo seems destined for oblivion, it’s rescued and revived, either by a new generation of players or, as has been the case more recently, by a video game. There has been no shortage of innovators, from Chuck Berry to Jimi Hendrix to Bob Mould, and “It Might Get Loud,” rather than surveying the whole field, assembles a representative power trio made up of Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, the Edge of U2 and Jack White, most famously of the White Stripes.  Interview and archival clips are interspersed with a summit meeting, half jam session, half graduate seminar in guitar metaphysics, on a soundstage loaded with all kinds of cool equipment. The guitarists trade riffs and thoughts and at the end make their way through an acoustic rendition of “The Weight.” It is both stirring and amusing to see three superstars strumming along to this song, originally recorded by the Band, which has long since become a staple for desultory buskers and late-night dorm-room singalongs. It’s a serviceable ballad, hard to butcher and tough to make your own, and thus a safe meeting ground for these three thorny individualists.  Mr. Page and the Edge, in their principal jobs, occupy the traditional guitarist’s role of sidekick, wingman and sonic bulwark for a flamboyant lead vocalist. Perhaps as a result, and perhaps also because of temperamental reticence, they prefer to talk with their fingers and strings.  Mr. White, whose singing style is as distinctive as his guitar playing, is a bit more voluble. As the junior member of this august delegation, he may also have the most to prove. He proves himself to be, along with everything else, a serious intellectual with a deep sense of the traditions, influences and latent possibilities of the modern musical vernacular.  Mr. Guggenheim spends some time following his subjects back to their roots, a fascinating journey into the musical past during which some notable commonalities emerge. Mr. Page, the Edge and Mr. White all honed their art in reaction to what they perceived as the dominant styles of the time.  Mr. Page came up playing skiffle, a peppy, folk-inflected genre that ruled British pop in the 1950s. After a successful stint as a studio session prodigy, he made his way to the Yardbirds and then to Led Zeppelin, where his interest in the blues, Eastern music and in the nuances of amplification reached full, thundering fruition.  The Edge, growing up in the downtrodden Dublin of the 1970s, discovered punk as an antidote to the bloated arena rock and fatuously shiny pop that saturated the airwaves. And Mr. White, in 1980s Detroit, wondered if hip-hop would permanently eclipse the instrumental sounds he cherished.  Each man has a different relationship to the musical past, and also to technology. Mr. White, a traditionalist wary of digital effects and innovations, is nonetheless as much given to tinkering as the Edge, who finds lyricism in complicated sonic treatments and modifications, or Mr. Page, famous for playing a double-necked guitar and recording John Bonham’s drum parts in the echoey atrium of a big, old house in the country.  For rock geeks of any age or taste, the lore in this documentary will be catnip. But “It Might Get Loud” is more than a narrowly focused fan artifact. It gives those of us with tin ears and clumsy fingers a chance to linger in the presence of serious artists with formidable chops and big, if not always clearly expressed, ideas about what they do. And it will put you in the mood to listen.  “It Might Get Loud” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some swearing and smoking.

Musically and visually sumptuous, "It Might Get Loud" is a three-headed, amped-up, guitar-shredding slamdown powered by a pan-generational trio of rock gods -- Led Zeppelin vet Jimmy Page, U2's the Edge and Jack White of the White Stripes -- who should cast a spell even in a tone-deaf theatrical marketplace. The brainchild of "The Dark Knight" exec producer (and presumed guitar nut) Thomas Tull, this highly cinematic docu is ostensibly about the cosmic significance of the electric guitar. But like most good movies, it's mostly about character. 
Page is a gentle charmer, his gentlemanly demeanor belying the legendary musical/personal excesses of Led Zep. The Edge, whose Dublin roots are traced with the occasional hilarious glimpse of '80s hair, is a modest monster. And White, the youngest, most aggressive guitarist takes a page from one of his own heroes, bluesman Son House: He's all about the attitude. White may be the least technically adept of the three, but he's clearly the most charismatic.
Following up his Oscar-winner "An Inconvenient Truth" with a decisive shift in pace, tone and rhythm, helmer Davis Guggenheim orchestrates individual bios, technical data and memorable playing (Page's display of dynamics on "Ramble On"; White's ability to impose his personality on any $4 guitar he picks up). Sound work is clean and raw, but the look of the film is as important as the music: Guitars are photographed by shooters Erich Roland and Guillermo Navarro with loving attention, their necks burnished by fingers and perspiration, their hardware dulled by sheer exposure, their lacquered bodies reflecting years of tender abuse. If this sounds like guitar porn, it sort of is.
If anything's missing, it's a solid statement of why these particular guys are important: The Edge, finishing an arena-sized U2 riff inside his personal, hardware-jammed studio, turns off the effects and reduces his own sound to a fairly anonymous scratch. He does it to make a point -- one the film should have made more emphatically -- about how (and why) guitarists attain the sounds that set them apart (via unorthodox tunings, electronics, chord inversions, etc.). White explains a bit of this, but a viewer may want to know more about what distinguishes this particular trio, aside from the fact that they appeal to the widest audience and are good onscreen.
"It Might Get Loud" might not have enough of such inside dope to make hardcore guitar-freaks entirely happy, but it does have a surfeit of personality, even virtuosity.

Marketed as a guitar summit between The Edge, Jimmy Page, and Jack White, Davis Guggenheim's affectionate, intermittently insightful behind-the-music doc is more electric triptych than meeting of the minds. Yes, the trio gather 'round the soundstage amps to teach each other a few tricks, but it's anticlimactic—save for the schoolboy smiles of White and The Edge's mug when Page instructs them in the finer art of piloting a Led Zeppelin. But the meat of the movie deals with their individual tales anyway: The Edge showing off the school rooms and studios where U2 became one; Page air-guitaring along to Link Wray's "Rumble" and guiding us through the manse where the fourth Zep record was recorded; White building a guitar out of little more than wood, wire, and a Coke bottle. Guggenheim pits young'un against old fart: White bemoans "technology," while The Edge is nothing but—so much so that U2 fans may find themselves disappointed by the revelation that the Wizard is nothing but a pile of pedals behind that arena-sized curtain. It's Page, a joyful instructor and natural storyteller, who steals the spotlight (Robert who ? More, please.) Only real complaint: The movie's not loud enough. They should have turned that fucker up to 11.
