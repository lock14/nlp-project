Once upon a time, diamonds may have been a girl�s best friend, but these days a woman might find it better to invest her own earned cash in gold and other commodities. That�s one of the best pieces of advice picked up by Chelsea (Grey), a $2,000-an-hour Manhattan escort who sells the �girlfriend experience,� a complete package in which her impeccable grooming, wide knowledge, and conversational ability make her a desirable companion for dinner and a movie prior to the inevitable sex. In the opening scenes, we listen as she discusses the film Man on Wire
 with that night�s date before getting advice on financial investments over a nightcap before bed. Life is a series of transactions, director Soderbergh seems to be telling us in this movie, shot in quick, DV-cam style (by Soderbergh under his Peter Andrews pseudonym) during the weeks leading up to the November 2008 presidential election and the U.S. economic free fall. The Girlfriend Experience
, like Soderbergh�s 2005 film, Bubble
, was made for Mark Cuban and Todd Wagner�s 2929 Entertainment, as part of a six-picture deal to produce low-budget, digital films that would premiere simultaneously in multiple platforms. As with Bubble
, The Girlfriend Experience
 uses nonprofessional actors, aside from lead Grey, who is the acclaimed star of more than 80 porn films and here debuts in her first �nonadult� role. Also in keeping with Bubble
, which takes place among workers in an Ohio doll factory, Soderbergh�s new film is interested in labor arrangements and working practices. However, he has few ideas regarding the commodification of sex that haven�t been heard and seen before. What is original is Soderbergh�s filmmaking gestalt, which puts us in Chelsea�s designer heels for a few days. The handheld camera and imperfect angles help us to see things from her perspective, and her push, despite her success, to improve her website, career, and investment portfolio seems little different than the interests of businessmen whose private jet rides to Las Vegas we also witness throughout the film. As with many of Soderbergh�s films, orderly continuity is thrown out the window in favor of a more cut-and-paste narrative that leads us through the story with nontemporal connections. Chelsea�s live-in boyfriend, who is OK with her job, also wants to improve his lot as a trainer by designing workout attire. This desire to improve one�s position leads to the film�s funniest sequence, in which Chelsea visits with the Erotic Connoisseur (played with gross panache by film critic Glenn Kenny), who writes online reviews of call girls. In another sequence that is returned to throughout the film, real-world writer Mark Jacobson is seen interviewing Chelsea in a restaurant about a story he wants to do about the �real� woman behind the girlfriend illusion. �If they really wanted you to be yourself,� she says, �they wouldn�t be paying you.� I wonder if we�re all engaging in something similar every time we hand over admission money at a theatre�s ticket window.

Fair warning: I had to see "The Girlfriend Experience" twice before its pieces settled into coherent shape. At first the movie seems as wayward and affectless as its main character, a high-priced Manhattan escort played by porn star Sasha Grey. From what we see here, the jury's still out on whether Grey can act in the traditionally accepted mainstream-movie manner, but that lack turns out to serve the film perfectly.
Her character, Chelsea, promises clients a "girlfriend experience"  - companionship, conversation, studied affection, and, at the end of the evening, sex. The johns project onto her a dream lover unique to their specific fantasies: She's built up from the lowest common denominator of their collective desires. Of course she has to be a blank screen.
Director Steven Soderbergh's nervy, successful conceit is to place Chelsea within an extremely specific setting: New York City in October of 2008. The market is melting down. Barack Obama is on the rise. The strivers of Manhattan are chattering with panic.
And everyone's a striver. The dark joke of "The Girlfriend Experience" is that to be alive in early-21st-century America is to be a hustler, and to be a hustler is to be both maxed out and hooked on the dream. Not exactly a new idea (nor does it pretend to be), but the shoe fits. Chelsea's customers are upscale professional men  - slick Euro financiers, neurotic screenwriters, everyone but Eliot Spitzer  - and they talk to her of job pressures and economic woes. Whatever this movie is, it's not a turn-on; the sex, when we see it, feels perfunctory, as if these men don't want to admit they're actually paying for therapy.
Chelsea has a boyfriend, too: Chris (Chris Santos), a young, generically handsome gym trainer struggling to climb up to the next rung of success. We see him selling a line of clothing to a sports store, selling a gym package to a customer, selling his services to the manager of a chain of boutique workout centers. He doesn't mind Chelsea's line of work because, hey, everyone has to hawk themselves to get ahead, and he's the one getting the real girlfriend experience. Isn't he?
Soderbergh is intrigued by the business of sex and the illusory sex appeal of business. He dices and slices "The Girlfriend Experience" into brief, nonsequential shards  - the film takes place over the course of a week, more or less, and we come at it from all sides. What could seem an empty stylistic exercise (and was, in the director's 2002 "Full Frontal") serves to bring a fresh urgency to the tale, ultimately granting the audience a wisdom and perspective the characters never possess.
In addition to her clients, Chelsea meets with her accountant, with a Web designer, with a journalist writing a story about her. They're each seeking a version of her that will pay their own bills. The journalist, in particular, isn't seeking sex but he still wants a "real" Chelsea; she parries his more personal questions not because she doesn't want to tell but because there's not all that much to say.
Ironically, the most honest person in the film is also the most despicable: a hulking, hyperarticulate Internet "escort critic" whose quid pro quo is a free tumble with Chelsea in exchange for a positive review. That this sleazeball is played by Glenn Kenny, a former movie critic for Premiere magazine, is the filmmaker's merry poke at Kenny's and my profession. Got it: We're whores, too. (Anyway, as a colleague and friend of Glenn's, I'm delighted to see him channel classic-movie swine like George Sanders and Sidney Greenstreet. The kid has potential.)
And at least the escort critic knows who he is. The sin of everybody else in "The Girlfriend Experience" isn't selling or buying sex but believing they're special  - that emotional and financial (and political) market fluctuations won't get them in the end. Chelsea frets about a new escort on the scene who may be poaching her clients but finds emotional solace with a new customer; her boyfriend, meanwhile, is seduced into a Vegas weekend by a group of hedge fund managers with a time share and a private jet. Things seem to be looking up at last.
What this serene, uninflected, unforgiving movie gives us instead is the moment before the crash.

The Girlfriend Experience  is one of Steven Soderbergh's bite-size, semi-improvised, shot-on-DV doodles (like Bubble  or Full Frontal ), and it's the best one he's made. As it opens, we see jagged medium-range shots of a man and a woman murmuring to each other in a taxi, a fancy low-lit bar, and a bedroom. By the time they wake up, we've more or less decided that they're a couple. Only they're not. The guy is some sort of wealthy finance dude, and the girl is a high-end escort who provides not just sex but conversation, canoodling over late-night wine, and morning-after chitchat  the illusion of intimacy.
Shot during the early days of the economic crisis, The Girlfriend Experience  is a mysterious and arresting look at how the culture of money turns love and desire into something you want to control. The escort, Chelsea, is played by Sasha Grey, a real-life adult-video star who is not so much a natural actress as a natural-born placid, affectless Barbie doll (imagine Eliot Spitzer consort  Ashley Dupré with a touch of Demi Moore). The movie has the fascination of a documentary about a fictional character. Chelsea, with her ambitious teasing blankness, occupies the center of a crumbling mosaic of  money, status, deception, and manipulated lust. We see her out with her clients; bickering with her live-in lover (Chris Santos), a gym trainer who pretends her job doesn't bother him; and in meetings, some sinister, that promise to advance her career. Chelsea's clients all seek ''the girlfriend experience,'' but they aren't alone; she, too, tries to barter herself into romance. Soderbergh  has captured an America in which the line between   selling out and selling yourself has never been thinner.  (Available on cable via on demand) 

 Steven Soderbergh shot “The Girlfriend Experience” over a few weeks last fall, with a relatively low budget, a portable high-definition video camera and a mostly nonprofessional cast. The film’s means are modest, not unlike the guerrilla techniques Mr. Soderbergh used in “Che,” but nonetheless “The Girlfriend Experience”  has a sleek, tailored look appropriate to its setting, which is the moneyed precincts of Manhattan at the height — and  most likely the end — of the recent gilded age. Every frame swims with signs of dearly bought, casually enjoyed luxury as the camera makes its way from high-end boutiques to jewelbox hotels, exclusive restaurants and the cabin of a private plane.  Chelsea (Sasha Grey), the main character — more case study than heroine —  is not only a consumer of top-of-the line merchandise, keeping a careful ledger of the clothes and accessories she has purchased and worn. She is also a commodity in this rarefied market, a prostitute whose specialty is alluded to in the title of the movie. She offers her rich clients more than sex with an obliging, pretty young woman. Sometimes there is no sex at all, as when one of them is especially anxious about the collapsing financial system. What she sells instead, or in addition, is a simulation of intimacy.  The first scenes, of Chelsea in the company of a handsome, well-mannered customer, are presented as a kind of optical illusion. For all we know, these two attractive people chatting unhurriedly over dinner, then kissing and sipping wine on the couch before making their way to bed, are lovers of long standing and deep attachment. Only when cash changes hands in the morning do we perceive the transactional nature of the affair.  Up to now Ms. Grey’s screen performances have been almost entirely in hard-core pornography, and this professional background, along with her character’s profession, adds an aura of titillation to the movie. But “The Girlfriend Experience” is less interested in sex than in money, which is shown to be a far more powerful and dangerous source of obsession, confusion, passion and calculation. The movie follows Chelsea from one encounter to the next, and most of those that are not on the clock might be characterized as business meetings and strategy sessions.  She chats with an accountant and also with a curious journalist (played by the New York magazine writer Mark Jacobson), and pays a visit to a creepy sex geek whose Web site rates the services of New York’s escorts and who styles himself the Erotic Connoisseur. (He is played by Glenn Kenny, a film critic and entertainment writer  — and thus a cordial screening-room acquaintance of mine —  with a combination of grandiose self-regard and theatrical self-disgust that recalls Orson Welles in his Paul Masson wine commercials.) What Chelsea reveals, as she tries to refine her marketing strategies and improve her brand, is not that everyone is a whore — equating capitalism with prostitution would be an easy, moralizing route for the film to take — but rather that everyone is hustling, trying to get a bit of leverage in a tough economic climate.  Chelsea, which might not be her real name, has a live-in boyfriend named Chris (Chris Santos), who works as a personal trainer, tending to the bodies of some of the same kinds of guys who hire Chelsea for her services. The similarities between them are established a little too pointedly, but they are nonetheless thought provoking. Both Chris and Chelsea belong to a sector of the economy that depends on the blurring of certain distinctions, between service and friendship, say, or profit and affection. Therapists, exercise instructors, nannies, manicurists, bartenders —  when you think about it, they are all paid for something that can easily be mistaken for love.  “The Girlfriend Experience” traces this potential category mistake in both directions. One john, as he and Chelsea strip down, rhapsodizes about the communication between them, which of course is the basis for any successful relationship. (“Yeah, totally,” she says, slipping between the sheets.) But Chelsea, who experiences a twinge of romantic jealousy —  disguised, perhaps, as professional rivalry — when she sees a once-loyal client on the town with another escort, is not immune to such feelings and finds herself drawn to a sympathetic new customer in ways that throw her off balance.  This upsets Chris, and it also puts a crack in the movie’s smooth veneer of cynical indifference. The idea that Chelsea, the girlfriend for sale, is herself succumbing to the false allure of the girlfriend experience, is an interesting one, but neither the script, by Brian Koppelman and David Levien (who also wrote “Ocean’s Thirteen”), nor Ms. Grey’s cool, tentative acting can quite sustain the level of emotional complication necessary to bring it to dramatic life. Mr. Soderbergh’s fractured chronology and chilly, observant style don’t help matters. The film, having mystified Chelsea’s poise and made much of her gift for persuasive artifice, cannot manage the complication of her vulnerability or chart the terrain of her inner life.  And this may be the point, at least in part. “The Girlfriend Experience” is about, and also traffics in, the intoxification of surfaces, and to say it objectifies Ms. Grey, who is very young (just 21) and very pretty, would be more plot summary than critique. Ms. Grey, whose career in pornography has been distinguished both by the extremity of what she is willing to do and an unusual degree of intellectual seriousness about doing it, is not so much acting here as posing a series of philosophical problems, testing the conceptual and experiential boundaries between degradation and empowerment, predator and prey, person and commodity.  The problem is that these questions are more provocative than what the movie does with them. It is by turns tryingly obvious and irritatingly oblique. But I suspect that “The Girlfriend Experience,” which has been available on video on demand for the past month, may look different a few years from now.  Mr. Soderbergh, like Jean-Luc Godard in the second half of the 1960s, is less concerned here with finish or coherence than with an authentic, on-the-fly recording of a moment, and right now that moment — the weeks just before the last presidential election, when the financial system was in midcalamity — is at once too close and too emphatically in the past for it to make a lot of sense. But when the turmoil of the last  12 months has receded and the  10th-anniversary deluxe collectors edition comes around, this strange, numb cinematic experience may seem fresh, shocking and poignant rather than merely and depressingly true.  Rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for sexual content, nudity and language.

With characteristic eclecticism, Steven Soderbergh follows "Che," his sweeping four-hour epic about a revolutionary hero, with "The Girlfriend Experience," a small-scale, digitally shot 77-minute chamber piece about a high-priced prostitute. Despite the pic's erotic subject matter and star (vet porn diva Sasha Grey), nothing could be less sensationalistic -- or moralistic -- than this fascinating study of free enterprise in free fall. While it may disappoint thrill-seekers, "Girlfriend" should still delight Soderbergh fans and niche auds. Sundance-sneaked (in rough cut) and officially preeming at Tribeca before a May 22 opening, this arthouse gem finds the helmer in top, and truly topical, form. 
Pic follows upscale call girl Chelsea (Grey, in an interestingly opaque perf) and her trainer boyfriend Chris (Chris Santos) over five chronologically scrambled days in the weeks before the 2008 election. Set in the trendy, low-lit haunts of New York's high rollers (the venues looking far sleeker and more anonymous than in the bright pastels of "Sex and the City" and other glossy Gotham fantasies), the pic presents a society in which every interaction reps a form of commodity exchange.
Everything is a brand: Chelsea advertises herself on her website, while her apparel designers figure more prominently than her johns in her journal (read in voiceover). Everybody has a get-rich scheme: Chris tries to shop himself around at various gyms and hawks a line of sports clothes on the side, while Chelsea yearns to own a boutique and quizzes her clients about recession-proof investments.
Soderbergh's complex, never-gimmicky shuffling of time subtly fragments the narrative to reveal the characters' untoward depths of self-delusion. Sometimes the irony proves less subtle, as in Chelsea's back-room encounter with the Erotic Connoisseur, a super-sleazy porn reviewer (portrayed convincingly by former Premiere critic Glenn Kenny) who mercilessly disses her charms in cyberspace, the narration of his review counterpointed by street muscians' rousing rendition of "Everyone's a Critic."
Like Godard, Soderbergh views prostitution as the ultimate paradigm for capitalism. But where Godard saw the hooker as a tragic or exploited victim ("My Life to Live," "Two or Three Things I Know About Her"), Soderbergh suggests there are no victims, only failed traders, in the post-Reagan era of DIY capitalism. Subverting the helmer's own megabuck "Ocean's" franchise, "Girlfriend" exposes the downside to those films' shiny, expensive stars and money-snatching thrills ("Ocean's Thirteen" was penned by "Girlfriend" scripters Brian Koppelman and David Levien).
Furthermore, in contrast to "Bubble," Soderbergh's earlier HD experiment with an other-end-of-the-telescope dissection of lower-class specimens, the helmer here wields total control of the pic's uniquely detached, seriocomic tone. The nervous hype of a group of hedge-fund managers, who insist on treating Chris to a private-jet weekend in Vegas, seems organically connected to the handheld camera swinging wildly from one partygoer to the next.
Chelsea, meanwhile, is a creature of cool surfaces and static interiors, ensconced in tony galleries, pricey restaurants and luxurious hotel rooms as she delivers the full "girlfriend experience" -- complete with thoughtful inquiries about clients' wives and kiddies, informed appreciation of "Man on Wire" and commiseration over the nose-diving economy.
Tech credits mesh faultlessly, as Soderbergh lensed and edited under his usual pseudonyms. Score by Morcheeba's Ross Godfrey hits all the rightly stressful notes.

Steven Soderbergh  has no particular stylistic signature and one of the most uneven oeuvres imaginable. But he does have interests. The essence of cine Soderbergh is the application of the filmmakers intelligence to a specific problem. In Che , it was the nature of a historical actor; in The Girlfriend  Experience , its the nature of acting.
The hardcore teen queen who took the name Sasha Grey  and refers to her porn films as performance art here plays a paid escort called Chelsea. Working out of the posh Manhattan loft she shares with her boyfriend, a professional trainer (played by erstwhile trainer Chris Santos ), Chelsea charges $2,000 an hour. For something like $25,000, a "date" with this slim, pretty, perfectly-turned-out 20-year-old can really be like a date. The movies opening scene has the escort and her less-than-middle-aged john dining at some painfully hip boîte and discussing the movie they just saw (Man on Wire ), before they retire to his pad to make out on the couchwith breakfast the next morning on the penthouse terrace. Its October 2008, the stock market is plunging, and, like most of Chelseas clients, he feels obligated to give her investment advice.
The Girlfriend Experience  is a mosaic of short, largely a-chronological scenes. Flashbacks are indistinguishable from flash-forwards; the emphasis is on Chelseas behavior in the here and now. Soderberghs camera placement signifies the intimacy that is the escorts product. The economic imperative rules nearly every interaction: Chelseas capital is her body and her persona. A conscientious entrepreneur, she dutifully writes up her datesnoting her outfit (half the movies budget must have gone for her clothes), topics of conversation, and sexual acts performed or not. Shes developing her own website and, in addition to her accountant and a financial manager, consults some online types, including a sex critic (onetime Premiere  movie critic, Glenn Kenny ), who offers to "up her profile" by reviewing her services on his blog.
With some clients, Chelsea plays the shrink, low-key and solicitous; with others, shes simply a source of physical comfort. With most, however, shes the ideal girlfrienda poised and personable ingénuewhich is more or less the role that Sasha Grey, reader of Thomas Pynchon , composer of "noise music," and winner of the 2008 AVN Award for Best Oral Sex Scene, has in "life." Grey, who has let it be known that she considered taking the porn name "Anna Karina ," is the only professional actor in the movie, playing a character who is always acting and who has to cope with things that might afflict any young actress. Or filmmaker. Chelsea is being pursued by a journalist (New York  magazine staff writer Mark Jacobson ), who wants to write a profile and seems genuinely eager to discuss her "inner you" (which is to say, the real Sasha). The movies most shocking bit of prose, however, is the scathingly hostile critical review that starts out panning her "flat affect" and "clammy hands" before really getting personal. Finally, in the movies key dramatic interlude, Chelsea is betrayed by a weak-willed screenwriterart imitating life imitating (Soderberghs) art.
No less than Che , or even the Oceans Eleven  movies, The Girlfriend Experience  is a film about its own making. Its also a hall of mirrors. Are we watching an authentic sacred monster playing the part of a cute little chippieor is it vice versa? (Imagine one performer embodying both the Marlon Brando  and Maria Schneider  roles in Last Tango in Paris .) Grey isnt the first porn actress to go straight, but she may be the first to allegorize her own situationprojecting an on-screen self-confidence thats indistinguishable from pathos.
