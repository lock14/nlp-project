Appaloosa  is a Western that tries to be square and hip, light and dark, all at the same time. Maybe it's no surprise that the results are mixed. Ed Harris , who directed the film  (it's his first time behind the camera since Pollock   eight years ago), also stars as Virgil Cole, a roving freelance law enforcer of  the 1800s who shows up in the town of  Appaloosa  along with his taciturn sidekick, Everett (Viggo Mortensen ). For a price, they offer to rid the town of Randall Bragg,  a sneering bully and killer played by Jeremy Irons  in what could almost be a grungier  impersonation of Daniel Day-Lewis  in There Will Be Blood  . Irons is enjoyably nasty, enough to make you wonder why no one thought to cast him in a Western before.
Harris, for his part, comes off as a classic sure-shot protector  that is, until he beats up a loser in a bar with so much more violence than is necessary that the film seems to be saying this lawman is a bit of a sociopath, too. (The actor's icy gleam certainly suggests it.) The movie, though, pulls back on this idea, and after that scene Virgil is never as interesting. Appaloosa  is a pleasingly spacious piece of work, but for all of its little tangles it never musters the kick of a psychological  duel. Renée Zellweger , as the peach-blossom-fresh Allison, is the most amoral character here  a woman who loves whomever's around  but except  for her, Appaloosa  is a throwback to the age when Westerns were quaint.

 There are some recent movie westerns — “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” was last year’s notable example — that self-consciously address the mythology of the Old West, using the familiar features of the genre to map new territory on the borderland between history and legend. Like the expensive, prestigious A-westerns of the postwar era, these movies explicitly take up big questions about national identity, historical memory and the nature of justice.  Other films, meanwhile (like last year’s remake of “3:10 to Yuma”), try to recapture the lean, tense storytelling style of the old B-westerns. Those pictures, staples of the American moviegoer’s diet in the middle decades of the last century, approached the grand themes more modestly and obliquely, embedding them in deceptively simple yarns about men, horses and guns.  With its studiously picturesque wide-screen compositions and its stately, sober pacing, Ed Harris’s “Appaloosa,” based on a novel by Robert B. Parker, seems at first to aspire to the A-list. Thankfully, though, its gestures toward grandiosity are superficial and few.  Mr. Harris can be an imposingly serious actor, his face as hard and unyielding as quarried stone, but there is often a saving glint of mischief in his eye. And in “Appaloosa,” his second feature as director (after “Pollock”), he leavens the atmosphere of costumed rigidity and somber stoicism with sly, relaxed humor.  There is no shortage of killing — it’s a large part of how Virgil Cole, Mr. Harris’s character, makes his living — but “Appaloosa” works best as a cunning, understated sex comedy. Superimposed on the usual diagram of good guys and bad guys, with a scattering of fools, cowards and mercenaries in the middle, is an improbable romantic triangle. Virgil and his sidekick, Everett Hitch (Viggo Mortensen), are like a long-married couple, with Everett as the patient helpmeet, backing up his partner’s gunfighting bravado with quiet competence and helping him with difficult Latinate words.  The two men make their living as lawmen for hire, imposing the rule of the gun on chaotic frontier towns like Appaloosa, in the New Mexico territory. There a gaggle of bumbling town elders (including the near-ubiquitous and always welcome Timothy Spall) need help dealing with a murderous landowner named Bragg. Played by Jeremy Irons with some vocal inflections borrowed from Daniel Day-Lewis in “There Will Be Blood,” Bragg is a smooth-talking killer attended by a large retinue of unshaven thugs.  As such he causes some problems for Virgil and Everett, but the real trouble starts when they meet Allie French (Reneé Zellweger), a not terribly grief-stricken widow who — how else to put it? — has Virgil at hello. Before long Virgil, who has never shown much interest in settling down, is building a house at the end of Appaloosa’s main street and asking Everett’s advice about window treatments.  This experiment in domestic bliss is complicated by a number of developments, including some darting glances (and then a bit more) between Everett and Allie, who turns out not to be the paragon of wifely constancy Virgil takes her for. The most subversive aspect of “Appaloosa” may be the way it quietly jettisons the shopworn sexual categories the Production Code imposed on the women of the old westerns.  Respectability is a hazy concept in a half-settled world ruled by greed and violence. Everett and Virgil are honorable men who dwell in a gray area between venality and virtue, and the compromises Allie makes in order to gain a bit of freedom and security are not all that different from theirs.  The movie’s tolerant, good-humored view of its characters drains it of some dramatic intensity, but Mr. Harris seems more interested in piquant, offhand moments than in big, straining confrontations. One important gunfight goes by so quickly and anticlimactically that even Everett remarks on how fast it was over. “That’s because the folks knew how to shoot,” Virgil says, offering an implicit defense of Mr. Harris’s crafty and unassuming approach to filmmaking.  And like Virgil and Everett, everyone involved in “Appaloosa” favors professionalism over bluster. This is especially true of Mr. Mortensen, whose features are half-hidden behind facial hair that is by far the showiest thing about him. Everett says very little and spends a lot of time just watching the other, more voluble characters, so Mr. Mortensen’s performance resides almost entirely in his eyes, which register tiny, unmistakable nuances of surprise, suspicion and amusement.  These are what make the movie worth watching. It’s not a great western, and, as I’ve suggested, it doesn’t really try to be. Some potentially interesting political themes — about what it means for a polity to privatize its apparatus of justice and security, about the relationship between righteousness and force — are left for other, more earnest pictures to explore. This one shows a square jaw and a steely gaze, but also a smile and a wink.  “Appaloosa” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has gun violence, brief nudity and profanity.

"Appaloosa" is a decent Western made in an era when a Western has to be pretty darn good to rope people into a theater to see it. With genial performances from Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen as good guys and a snakey Jeremy Irons as the chief baddie, Harris� first directorial outing since his impressive and entirely different "Pollock" biopic bears echoes of many genre predecessors, especially Howard Hawks� "Rio Bravo" -- but echoes they remain. With a sometimes goofy sense of humor as its main distinguishing mark, this New Line title fed into the Warner Bros. distribution mill looks poised for modest fall biz.
Having nothing to do with a horse or Sidney J. Furie�s 1966 Universal release "The Appaloosa," starring Marlon Brando, this very faithful adaptation of Robert B. Parker�s novel instead focuses on two dapper roving lawmen -- they probably wouldn�t like being called mercenaries -- who turn up in the eponymous New Mexico town after the local marshal and two of his men are gunned down by Irons� Randall Bragg, a gang leader bent on controlling a good deal of New Mexico territory.
Script by Robert Knott and Harris slips into semi-comic mode almost at once, as Virgil Cole (Harris), clad in a well-tailored black outfit, and more taciturn right-hand man Everett Hitch (Mortensen) lay out their terms to local civic leaders (led by Timothy Spall, trying to maintain English propriety in an unlikely setting) for restoring order: What they say goes. 
The men prove their worth by taking down three of Bragg�s boys who come to test them, after which Bragg himself turns up for a chat with Virgil. "Maybe you aren�t good enough," Bragg threatens with a John Huston-like growl in a classic Hawksian line, and you know there�s a showdown waiting at the end of the road.
But there are many high noons in between. Newly arrived widow Allison French (Renee Zellweger) presents herself as a proper lady and intrigues Virgil as such, but subsequently provides plenty of reasons to believe she is anything but. Harris, as actor and director, milks for all its worth Virgil�s surprise at his sudden bent for domesticity with this piano-playing rose, given that his previous history with women has been limited to "whores and squaws." For his part, Everett observes his pal�s courtship with incredulous bemusement, although he soon gets an insight into Allison�s true character he�s not about to share with his friend.
When one of Bragg�s gang slips into town to say he�ll testify in court against his boss, Virgil and Everett manage to arrest the slippery villain. It�s here that the story hews closely to "Rio Bravo," as the two lawmen stand vigilant guard at their small jail until a judge can arrive to try their prisoner, knowing that at some point the captive�s men will try to spring him and kill the witness in the bargain.
But by the midway point, there are still plenty of surprises, and the track takes many turns before anyone can get a good night�s sleep.
Dialogue, much of it lifted straight from Parker�s novel, proves mostly engaging, especially as it relates to Virgil�s dedication to improving his vocabulary. He tries to drop impressive, polysyllabic words into his speech whenever he thinks of them; some attempts are more successful than others, but are invariably comic. When the well-spoken Bragg inhabits the cell right next to his desk, he�s put at a distinct linguistic disadvantage.
Pic�s most disappointing aspect stems from the visuals. Direction, especially in the interiors, consists of standard master shots and cut-ins, while outdoors stuff, mostly shot in New Mexico, looks oddly thin and washed-out. Compositions lack boldness, and the action could have generated more visceral excitement.
Interest is mainly sustained by the plot and repartee between Harris and Mortensen, with Irons reliably injecting menace whenever he�s on. Gradual revelation of Allison�s true nature offers mild surprise. But given that Virgil credits his long survival in his risky line of work to a reserve born of his belief that "feelings get you killed," one wonders exactly what it is about her that makes him drop his heart-of-stone resolve for this particular woman; Zellweger doesn�t exactly clarify the matter. 


'Course he's willing to die. You think we do this kinda work 'cause we scared to die?" So speaks Virgil Cole  (Ed Harris ) about his sidekick Everett Hitch  (Viggo Mortensen ), as the two stare down a posse of bad guys in Appaloosa, New Mexico , circa 1882. Cole and Hitch, who are good at killing but try to ply that skill for the right side of the law, are the new marshal and deputy, and that posse's determined to spring their boss, Randall Bragg , from jail. A rancher with no cattle but nefarious plans for taking over the town, Bragg (Jeremy Irons , king of suave menace) is also an itchy-fingered killer, having shot the last town marshal right off his horse. He'll surely hang, but only if Cole and Hitch can hold onto him until the trial—and we all know what slowpokes those traveling judges can be.
While they wait, Cole will fall hard for Allie (Renée Zellweger ), a widow who wears her hair in a schoolmarm's bun but is about as faithful as a dance-hall working girl. She even puts the moves on Hitch, who kisses her back (as any cowboy would) and then pushes her away, declaring: "I'm with Virgil. And so are you."
If most of the dialogue in the pleasantly old-fashioned Appaloosa  has a zingy precision, that's because Harris, who directs from a screenplay he co-authored, is smart enough to quote—almost scene by scene and word by word—from Robert B. Parker 's 2005 novel (to which a sequel, Resolutio n, has just been published). It could be said that Harris and his co-writer, Robert Knott , haven't done a whole lot of writing, but as Cole himself might say, there's no need to get all fancy with what's plain and true.
Appaloosa  has the shifting boundaries of friendship and love on its mind, but this isn't a movie likely to raise comparisons to the tortured revisionism of Unforgiven , or even to last year's hyperactive shoot-'em-up, 3:10 to Yuma  —and that's surely fine by Harris. He and his collaborators are playing it straight with a timeless male fantasy—horse, hat, six-shooter—a traditional approach that will please moviegoers like my dad and yours: men who walked out of No Country for Old Men  puzzled, feeling like they'd been cheated out of a climactic gun battle between lawman and villain.
Harris keeps the shootouts coming—there's even a run-in with some canny Indians—but in this efficient western, there are no close-ups of shifting eyes and nervous trigger-fingers—just sudden, over-in-a-blink violence. Truth be told, it probably wouldn't have killed the director to belabor the tension a little more, but hey, real men don't drag things out.
A four-time Oscar nominee—including a Best Actor nod for Pollock , which he also directed—Harris specializes in portraying men whose excess machismo hasn't turned them mean, who watch and carefully measure the world before making their move. So Virgil Cole, who is slow and deliberate and also the fastest draw in the West, should be the perfect role for him, and yet, oddly, Harris often appears to be not quite centered, as if Harris the director hadn't found a way to help Harris the actor be as focused as Cole needs to be.
Holding one's body still in front of a movie camera while also giving the sense of a mind in motion is a specialized art, one with few masters. Paul Newman  comes to mind, notably in his later career, as does Robert Duvall , a perennial movie cowboy who will surely wish that Appaloosa  had come his way. And now, it would seem, there is Mortensen, who steals this film by doing nothing much more than lean against doorways and bar counters. Like Harris, Mortensen is a great listener, and good listeners—in life and in movies—barely move. That quality is just right for the role of Hitch, whose life hangs on Cole's next word and slightest gesture. It's an old truth, and not just about westerns: When the talking stops, the dying begins.
