It's a lovely summer Sunday at the riverside park in the capital city : picnics, touch football, pretty girls listening to iPods. Strollers buy snacks from the family-run food truck in the parking lot by the embankment. Something massive and slimy hangs from the underside of a bridge.
Say what?
A crowd gathers to gawk and the thing slowly uncurls from its girder and knifes into the water. It swims with the current, people run along the bank, shouting and pointing. Then someone pelts it with a beer can.
Mistake.
How do you make a monster movie in the 21st century? Or rather, how do you make a monster movie that's not a joke? Bong Joon-ho's merrily deranged "The Host" provides an answer: by inviting audiences into the joke, then knocking them continually off-balance. The puckish South Korean filmmaker's third movie is many things: dysfunctional family comedy, social satire, bureaucratic farce, germ-warfare horror flick. Mostly, though, it's "Godzilla" with a severe case of Murphy's Law, and it is never less than bizarrely delightful.
On one side of the ledger we have the monster: a galumphing sea-serpent with stegosaurus legs and a mouth that's a Freudian nightmare. We learn in a B-movie opening scene that the creature's probably a result of 200 gallons of formaldehyde poured directly into Seoul's Han River, but whatever: It's big and it's ticked.
On the other side we have the Park family, the clan running that snack van by the river. They're hardly heroic but they're all we've got: grease-spattered grandpa Hie-bong (Hie-bong Byeon), his useless layabout son Gang-du (Kang-ho Song), and Gang-du's no-nonsense schoolgirl daughter Hyun-seo (Ah-sung Ko).
Later we'll meet Hie-bong's other useless son Nam-il (Hae-il Park), who at least is able to get up in the morning but still can't find a job, and Nam-il's fetching sister Nam-joo (Du-na Bae), first seen losing an archery contest on national TV. It helps to have someone handy with a bow and arrow in this kind of movie. It's supposed to, anyway.
Like a mob fleeing the monster's approach, "The Host" fans out in a number of directions, most of them unexpectedly funny. The schoolgirl gets carted off by the beastie but is able to check in with Dad before her cell phone batteries run out. The Parks then mount a rescue attempt that is stymied by (a) government troops who insist Gang-du has been infected by a virus carried by the monster and (b) their own spectacular ineptitude.
The United States and the World Health Organization get involved; soon the Parks are on the run with their faces broadcast on TV under the legend "Warning: Infected Family." At a certain point it becomes unclear what's the greater horror: the rampaging mutant, the government's over reaction, or the populace's bovine acceptance of that over reaction. "This man's brain may be our only hope!" says one government scientist about Gang-du, and that's when you know the country's really in trouble.
South Korea can take a joke, at least, since "The Host" broke box-office records when it opened there last year. It should find find an audience in this country, too. The special effects are both marvelous and richly bogus, and they come courtesy of New Zealand's Weta Digital and San Francisco's The Orphanage. The ease with which the monster back-flips along the underpinnings of highway superstructures is as mesmerizing to us as it is to the characters.
Still, it's Bong's movie, and he plays with the creature-feature genre like a brat with a fresh toy. His last film was 2003's much-praised detective story "Memories of Murder"; he's working on an omnibus project called "Tokyo" next with France's L�os Carax and Michel Gondry, both directors with similarly shaggy approaches to filmmaking.
"The Host" reflects either rigorous playfulness or major-league attention deficit disorder; either way, it's an engaging exercise in entropy. Gallant plans go awry, people fall asleep when you least expect them to, mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. Bong gives us a rough beast slouching toward Seoul, and the idea that we get the monsters we deserve is enough to give him the giggles.

         A monster movie for the 21st century, "The Host" takes familiar genre elements and then crushes them in much the same way the title creature runs amok along the Seoul riverbank it calls home. Written and directed by South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, it's a film that will catch you leaning in one direction and abruptly pull you in another, all the while building to a surprisingly emotional climax.
 
 On a U.S. military base in South Korea, a patronizing, intransigent American official (Scott Wilson in a cameo) orders a Korean subordinate to pour toxic formaldehyde down a drain that empties into the Han River. Years later, a mutant creature emerges from the watery depths, terrorizing the crowds along its park-like banks. It's a fairly standard monster movie setup — so standard that it looks suspiciously like parody.
 


         






   Further tilting the early tilt toward comedy is the director's generous use of slapstick in the opening sequences. But just when you think he's playing it strictly for laughs, he throws in some attention-grabbing scares. Bong has a lot more on his mind than caricature.
 
 At the center of the turmoil is the disjointed Park family. Father Hee-bong (Byun Hee-bong) runs a food stand beside the river with his ne'er-do-well eldest son, Gang-du (Song Kang-ho). Another son, Nam-il (Park Hae-il), is an unemployed university grad, while daughter Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na) is a competitive archer. Gang-du has a precocious teenage daughter, Hyun-seo (Ko A-sung), whose mother ran off after giving birth to her.
 
 The family is introduced in humorous, fairly broad terms, but Bong slyly develops the characters as the film evolves, shedding its popcorn veneer to become something more complex. The transition isn't seamless and the pace noticeably slows as the emphasis shifts to the family's damaged relationships — even as they attempt to hunt down the monster.
 
 However, this unflappable tempo that dominates the movie's midsection succeeds in allowing each character the space to assert him or herself and earn the emotional currency that makes the finale so affecting. Young Ko is particularly impressive in her intensity.
 
 The script is laced with political jabs that include a solid broadside at the perceived paternalism embedded in U.S.-South Korean relations. Bong is also concerned with South Korea's social structure — poking fun at the soullessness of salarymen while championing the working class — and it's no surprise that he studied sociology at the University of Yonsei.
 
 With a subversive streak as wide as the Han and a title open to interpretation, "The Host" confounds our expectations while providing top-notch entertainment. For Bong, the monster movie is an ample vessel, one that he can fill with social criticism while discovering exuberant amusement in the process.
 
 
 "The Host." MPAA rating: R for creature violence and language. Running time: 1 hour, 59 minutes. In general release.   

The inconvenient truth about illegally dumping toxic chemicals down Korean drains is that years later, a giant mutant sea monster will  rise up out of the polluted waters of Seoul's Han River to terrorize the populace, sure as Godzilla rose out of 1950s H-bomb testing in the South Pacific. The silver lining to the toxic cloud is that Bong Joon-ho, the playful and stylish director of The Host , knows his Godzilla , his B movies, his pop culture, and his video culture, too. His wildly entertaining saga should become the hip, thinking-person's monster movie of choice.
The thing that gobbles in a bravura display of CGI is an indiscriminate eater of human bystanders. But the river monster wraps a tentacle around Park Hyun-seo (Ko A-sung), a pretty schoolgirl, with save-for-snack delicacy, leaving her dysfunctional family  father, grandfather, uncle, and archery-champion aunt  to chase after the slimy, amoral beast. When the filmmaker isn't eliciting honest empathy, he is sneaking in lively, absurdist commentary about SARS, mass hysteria, health-care bureaucracy, consumerism,  and American-Korean relations: For instance, it was an arrogant U.S. Army doctor who  ordered his Korean assistant to pour the poison down the drain; officious health officials quarantine frightened citizens on the unproven grounds that they have been infected with a virus; and TV crews roam an auditorium filled with families mourning their eaten dead, zooming in on scenes of grief. The picture makes for a very unstreamlined two hours. But while The Host  sometimes idles, it never drags. Instead, it wriggles with bioenergy and cinematic life.

 The plug-ugly monster that jumps out of a city river in “The Host” to scoop up and chomp down on those unlucky enough to cross its path — men, women, a whip-smart 13-year-old girl named Hyun-seo — looks like something you might find lurking at the bottom of a Hieronymus Bosch painting or trolling the depths of a murky restaurant aquarium in the middle of a toxic dump. Blink and it looks like something that slimed out of the sea in a creationist nightmare.  It would have to be an awfully big aquarium, as it happens, because this fishy creature, this mystery from the deep with the gulping petaled mouth and prehensile tail is the size of a school bus and restless to boot. It rushes underwater and races over ground, its sturdy little legs churning turf. Every so often it spirals into a back flip as gracefully as a prepubescent Romanian gymnast or drops into the water like a knife, scoring a perfect-10 dive. It’s as ugly as sin, this thing, but it has style to burn. As does this film, a loopy, feverishly imaginative genre hybrid from the South Korean filmmaker Bong Joon-ho, about the demons that haunt us from without and within.  By turns a carnival of horrors and a family melodrama (variations on the same theme), “The Host” is also a rethink of those 1950s cine-quickies in which mondo ants, locusts, wasps, crabs and snails and one seriously ticked off amphibious reptile go on the rampage, visiting punishment on a hapless, guilty humanity. Like Godzilla (Gojira in the original Japanese), some of these mutants were born under a mushroom cloud; others were hatched in the B-movie hothouse of box-office opportunism. The creature running amok in “The Host,” meanwhile, was spawned by a 37-year-old South Korean who has spent his entire life in the shadow of the American military presence. No wonder the bad guys look like character actors on leave from Hollywood. They are.  As if in preparation for the carnage to come, the once-upon-a-time story opens in a modern autopsy room with two men, an American and a Korean, dressed in scrubs. Bathed in an eerie, silvery blue light, the American boss (Scott Wilson) orders the Korean (Kim Hak-sun) to dump bottle upon bottle of formaldehyde down the drain, on the pretext that the containers have become too dusty.  Stunned, the Korean objects, noting that the chemical will flow from the drain into the Han River, the fat ribbon of water that cuts through Seoul and empties into the Yellow Sea. The American grimaces, capping his request with a barely veiled threat (“That’s an order”) that betrays him as an emissary of American military might.  Fast-forward to a day like any other and the Park family running its snack stand on the banks of the Han. Calculatingly, goofily dysfunctional, with enough issues to populate a couple of 12-step groups, the Parks don’t seem all that different from the brood in “Little Miss Sunshine.” There’s gramps, Hee-bong (Byun Hee-bong), his three adult children — including an unemployed salaryman, Nam-il (Park Hae-il), and his archery-champ sister, the lovely Nam-joo (Bae Doo-na) — and only grandchild, the aforementioned Hyun-seo (Ko A-sung). Mostly, though, there is the family’s oldest son, Gang-du (the wonderful Song Kang-ho), an overgrown baby with a shock of badly bleached blond hair and a moon face that waxes and wanes depending on his proximity to his beloved daughter, Hyun-seo.  Bong Joon-ho’s  previous features include a smart-aleck exercise in gratuitous nonsense called “Barking Dogs Never Bite” (they just comically kick the bucket) and the shiver-inducing thriller “Memories of Murder.” As he did in “Memories,” about the hunt for a serial killer, Mr. Bong relies on a familiar bag of movie tricks in “The Host.” But, much like Steven Spielberg (an unmistakable influence), he makes all those old tricks feel new. That’s especially true during the monster’s first attack, when Mr. Bong instills an initial sense of calm and then of rapidly escalating panic through his masterful  orchestration of the various tempos created by the actors (walking, then running), the monster (swimming, then galloping), the camera (tracking, then racing) and the edits (slow, slow, fast!).  The opening attack is sensationally well directed, and if the rest of the film never quickens the pulse in the same accelerated fashion, it does give the story both its principal excuse (the monster grabs the granddaughter) and something just as satisfying if unexpected: a portrait of parents, children and the ties that bind, sometimes to the point of near-strangulation. “The Host” may be born out of sociopolitical tensions, scares about SARS and the avian flu, or Mr. Bong’s imagination, but it’s also a snapshot of a modern South Korea bordering on social anarchy, one in which a fatalistically obedient old-timer and his three preternaturally immature adult children face down a rampaging beast along with clueless doctors, Keystone Kops, faithless friends and even hordes of paparazzi.  Besieged by humans and monster alike, the family has nowhere to go but deep inside itself. This us-against-them strategy works deviously well because it ensures that the Parks are the star attraction, not the monster. Not that the creature doesn’t have its share of show-stopping moments, as when it’s caught by surprise in midgulp, a pair of legs dangling from its mouth. Or when it regurgitates a corpse into its lair with a slimy splat, an act it seals with a tender lick of its long tongue. It’s in this lair that Hyun-seo, her face and schoolgirl’s uniform flecked with muck, proves her mettle, retrieving the cellphone that becomes the lifeline to her family and playing protector to another child who adds a touching dimension to the mix.  Although some of Mr. Bong’s action scenes here are the match of those in “Jaws,” he seems made of sterner stuff than Mr. Spielberg. He can seem just as cruel, readily putting children in mortal danger, but he doesn’t share the American master’s compulsive need for tidy endings.  “The Host” is a loose, almost borderline messy film, one that sometimes feels like a mash-up of contrasting, at times warring movies, methods and moods.  Mr. Bong would as soon have us shriek with laughter as with fright. But it’s precisely that looseness, that willingness to depart from the narrative straight and narrow, that makes the film feel closer to a new chapter than a retread.  Likewise it is Mr. Bong’s willingness not just to contemplate but also to deliver a worst-case scenario that separates “The Host” from run-of-the-mill horror and may have helped make it a runaway hit in Korea. Closer to home the film reminds me less of the usual splatter entertainments that clutter American movie theaters and more of another recent horror film, the one in which a newly thawed alien with a giant brain delivers apocalyptic warnings to humanity about its imminent future. I’m talking of course about the documentary “An Inconvenient Truth.”  Much like that Al Gore big-screen lecture, “The Host” is a cautionary environmental tale about the domination of nature and the costs of human folly, and it may send chills up your spine. But only one will tickle your fancy and make you cry encore, not just uncle.  “The Host” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains monster violence galore. 
On almost every level, there's never quite been a monster movie like "The Host." Egregiously subverting its own genre while still delivering shocks at a pure genre level, and marbled with straight-faced character humor that constantly throws the viewer off balance, much-hyped big-budgeter about a huge mutant tadpole that emerges from Seoul's Han River is a bold gamble that looks headed to instant cult status. Broader biz, especially beyond East Asia, will depend heavily on reaction to its world preem in Directors Fortnight, and some re-editing would better equip it for specialty distribution in the West.
Film is set for a wide, late July release in South Korea, followed by an early September roll-out in Japan, which provided almost half of the reported $10 million coin (huge in local terms). Helmer Bong Joon-ho ("Barking Dogs Never Bite," "Memories of Murder") has not ruled out some tweaking in the meantime. Reaction at its gala midnight screening on Sunday, heavily populated by Asiaphiles, was a mixture of admiration and discombobulation.
Beyond all the fancy visual effects -- way above the rocky level of recent Asian fantasies like "The Myth" and "The Promise" -- in tone the picture falls somewhere between the social parable of "Dogs" and the character-driven, offbeat drama of "Memories."
Pic, which is not even in widescreen, will be best appreciated by auds who just go with the quirky flow rather than expect regulated, U.S.-style thrills. In its mix of genre-bending, political asides and character emphasis, there are strong parallels with Larry Cohen's 1982 cult classic, "Q: The Winged Serpent."
Prologue, set six years ago at the U.S. Army Base in Yonsan, Seoul, has a South Korean flunky ordered by his Yank boss (Scott Wilson) to empty gallons of aging formaldehyde into the sink -- and therefore straight into the Han River, which flows through the capital. Clearly ludicrous English-language scene (which would benefit from revoicing) signals Bong's lack of interest in making a science-heavy blockbuster -- there's little emphasis on the usual government-military paraphernalia of such movies.Cut to October '06 and locals are enjoying a day out on the banks of the river. Among them are convenience stall owner Park Heui-bong (Byeon Heui-bong), his idle doofus son, Gang-du (Song Gang-ho, the cop in "Murder"), and the latter's daughter, young high-schooler Hyeon-seo (Ko A-sung).
When something is spotted hanging beneath one of the bridges and then sliding into the river, the locals pelt it with cans and snacks. But, Gang-du and Hyeon-seo are more interested in watching the televised National Archery Championships, in which her young aunt, Nam-ju (Bae Du-na, lead in "Dogs"), is competing.
First appearance of the monster is aces, catching the viewer off guard after a slow build-up. Combo of visceral energy and offbeat humor, plus Lee Byeong-woo's pounding drum music, is impressive, and as the creature finally scoops up Hyeon-su with its tail and swims off,the stage is set.
When the Park family assembles later at a funeral parlor, pic again throws the viewer as their grief turns to physical in-fighting, with Gang-du's younger brother, jobless graduate Nam-il (Park Hae-il), blaming Gang-du for Hyeon-su's death.
The government claims the creature is host to a horrifying, unknown virus and fumigates the area. Following the death of a Yank soldier, the U.S. military decides on "direct intervention" by using a secret chemical weapon, Agent Yellow. Meanwhile, Gang-du & Co., convinced by a cell phone call that Hyeon-su is still alive, escape the government quarantine and hunt down her and the creature. Script's political content is more occasional barbs than a fully developed subtext. Bong maintains the focus on the Park family, with Gang-du lumbering through the drama with assists from onetime student revolutionary Nam-il and expert archer Nam-ju. Problematic central section could do with 15 minutes of tightening. Final half-hour, however, is aces as all the threads connect, with no simple heroes and a kind of sad, messy triumph, plus a barbed coda.
Perfs are more than fine with especial kudos to Ko as the plucky Hyeon-seo, local star Song as the working-class slob, and Bae as the sportswoman.
Visual f/x, supervised by Kevin Rafferty ("Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace") and largely done by San Francisco-based The Orphanage, are a slick meld of CGI and animation, while always reminding the audience that, at the end of the day, the creature is only a movie monster.

Gross-out horror is never far from comedy and The Host , Bong Joon-ho 's giddy creature feature, has an anarchic mess factor worthy of a pile of old Mad  magazines. A broadly played clown show full of lowbrow antics, Bong's big splat is itself a sort of monsterthe top grossing movie in South Korean historyand, since it surfaced at Cannes  last May, festival audiences having been slurping it down like ramen.
The Host 's main attraction is a mutant carnivore-cum-somersaulting slimeball. As Mad  once "animated" a garbage dump called the Heap, so The Host  presents what might be a chunk of phlegm hawked from the maw of our despoiled earth. This killer tadpole can swim like a fish, scuttle like an insect, and run like a Spielberg raptor. Even more than the 1933 King Kong , Bong's creature is a surreal entity with no fixed size. As the materialization of dread, this nameless monster is harder to pin down than the radioactive, fire-breathing Godzilla. It's an "It."
Bong's allegory is deliberately free-floating; still, that the thing has its origins in American stupidity and hubris is made clear in The Host 's prologue, set in a morgue on a U.S. Army  base. Offended by the dust on some unused bottles of formaldehyde, an overbearing American officer orders a hapless Mr. Kim to dump gallons of toxic chemicals down the drain and into the Han River . A few years pass and two fishermen spot something gross swimming in the murk. . . . Cut to the wacky dysfunctional family who operate a riverside fast-food stand.
The Park clan consists of an elderly patriarch and his two deadbeat sonsone a slob, the other a drunkand a daughter who is a championship archer with an unfortunate psychological hitch. There's also 11-year-old granddaughter Hyun-seo, courtesy of the slobbusy dishing out fried squid when he realizes that, down by the river, picnickers are transfixed by something suspended beneath the bridge.
The It falls into the water and swims over. Ordinary people, being what they are, merrily pelt the unknown creature with garbage until, with projectile force, it bounds ashore and the chase is onthud, grab, leaping lizards! Establishing a galumphing tone of carnivalesque terror that trumps just about everything to follow, this picnic panic is a comic replay of 9/11 or even Sergei Eisenstein 's "Odessa Steps ." Then the thing dives back into the river, scattering a gaggle of swan-shaped paddleboats, with little Hyun-seo in its fishy clutches. From then on, it's personal.
Like the original, Japanese version of Godzilla , The Host  gives catastrophe a naturalistic follow-through. A mass funeral for the monster's victims is held in a gymnasium that's housing traumatized survivors. The elder Park vows to rescue his granddaughteror at least wreak vengeance. The girl's aunt solemnly offers up her bronze medal. Unlike the equivalent moments in Godzilla , however, this somber scene soon disintegrates into farce. The drunken brother arrives to immediately start blaming his siblings. The entire family is rolling-on-the-floor hysterical when the shelter is quarantined. The creature, it's explainedin such a way as to defy any rational explanationwas carrying a mysterious virus. But is it the It or South Korea  who is really the host?
From the perspective of the Parks, the monster comes to embody whatever irrational forces oppress them. The authorities are essentially the It's agents; their main concern is subduing the "contaminated" family who, having received a cell phone call from Hyun-seo, are desperate to escape. Discovering that the creature is warehousing its victims, the Parks troll the roiling Han for their lost child. Meanwhile, the authorities are after the nonexistent virus. The sinister Americans are even planning to drill a guy's head for it: "The virus has definitely invaded his brain." It's what Borat called a "war of terror."
Bong, who has dealt with desperate pet-nappers and serial killers in his previous featuresthe crazy romantic comedy Barking Dogs Never Bite  (2000) and the sociological policer Memories of Murder  (2003)has no difficulty integrating the horrifying, the stooge-like, and the everyday. (In that, he's even more extreme than our own masters of sociologic shock schlockGeorge Romero, Larry Cohen , and Joe Dante .) Just as grisly bio-horror is tricked out with cheesy effects and inappropriate music, so do spasms of naturalistic grief-coping alternate with pop-eyed slapstick. The Host  is disgusting in some original and unforgettable ways, as when the monster vomits out human bones and an indigestible (or non-biodegradable) can of beer.
That can is key. Korea is imagined as someone's toxic waste dump. Criticized by the U.S. and the World Health Organization  for bungling the situation, the authorities plan to spray Seoul  with the evocatively named "Agent Yellow." (Not surprisingly, Bong is affiliated with South Korea's left-wing Democratic Labor Party.) The movie's climax conflates an anti-Agent Yellow protest, a police riot, and the family's inspirational last stand. Bong is a generous director. Although The Host  has a tendency to repeat its routines, the filmmaker typically ends each scene with some offbeat comic lagniappe that serves to reground the fantasy in some quotidian morass.
As amorphous as its creature, The Host  has an engaging refusal to take itself seri ouslyit's no War of the Worlds  and yet, however funny, it is hardly camp. The emotions that The Host  churns up, regarding idiot authority and poisonous catastrophe, are too rawtoo close to disgust. Is revulsion a form of revolt? Bong's disaster farce ends with a long shot of the frozen Han. There's the sense of something new brewing in the sludgenamely his movie.
