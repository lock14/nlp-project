Don�t fear the trembling of the skeptics: Newell has not ruined the Harry Potter
 franchise. This fourth film, following Alfonso Cuar�n�s celebrated Prisoner of Azkaban
, is qualitatively different from its cinematic forebears: It doesn�t linger on the gothic curlicues of its source material, it moves straightforwardly from place to place, and it emphasizes the emotional development of its characters with dramatic interplay rather than expressionistic, atmospheric gloom. This approach makes sense; there are no Dementors here, and despite the third-act appearance of He Who Will Not Be Named (Fiennes, whose subdued monster make-up makes him appear noseless), the really, really scary part is the school dance. Newell understands that the real thrust of the source material � at least in this particular book � is its characters� passage into adolescence, so he keeps a tight rein on author J.K. Rowling�s airy digressions into magical whimsy (the Quidditch World Cup tournament, for example, merits a minimum of screen time compared to its lengthy depiction in the novel) and takes us right into the heart of the beast: teenage hormones, fallings-out with friends, meeting weird kids from other schools, being hated by your schoolmates, fearing your new teacher yet again, and having to slow dance. Not every purist will like Newell�s strategy, but it�s certainly better than the textual slavishness of Chris Columbus� Potter
 films. Here at least we sense the presence of a thinking person behind the controls, and Newell is correct to play to his own directorial strengths, which differ from Cuar�n�s. When he does indulge in the fancy stuff � Harry enters the Weasley family�s tiny and spartan-seeming tent at the World Cup campground and discovers inside a sprawling, palatially furnished guest house � he brings it right back to his characters: "I love magic," Harry (Radcliffe, who�s getting wooden as he ages) breathes, taking it all in. Were such attention not paid to onscreen economy, the movie would be a mess, with its sprawling plot and myriad new characters. (As it is, there�s very little exposition, so Muggles will be lost.) Newell is also somehow essentially British: He adores his thespian ensemble, he�s interested in the social realism underpinning the book�s flights of fantasy, and he can�t resist putting Jarvis Cocker in a scene. In other words, the movie is darker than the others not because it�s more otherworldly, but because it�s more real � a seeming irony that actually makes sense. But is it good? Sure, it�s good at what it does well. When Harry asks Cho Chang (Katie Leung) to the Yule Ball and she shoots him down because she�s already going with that lunkhead squarejohn Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), it�s as terrifying as Harry�s encounter with mer-people in the Black Lake. Per usual, the supporting characters steal the show, and Newell gives them infinite space. (He probably gives Miranda Richardson, as tabloid diva Rita Skeeter, a little too much room, but the whole movie could be about Shirley Henderson as bathroom apparition Moaning Myrtle, and that would be fine.) Parents should be aware that it�s more explicitly violent � hence the PG-13 rating, a first for the series � but really its execution is more adult in a variety of ways, and correctly so.


There's a darkness on the edge of Hogwarts, and its name is adolescence.
"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," the latest big-screen installment of the unstoppable pop-culture juggernaut, marks a sea change. Just as J.K. Rowling's fourth novel -- a 734-page anvil that stood as the white-hot apex of the Potter fad -- poured a bucket of teen hormones into the Gryffindor stew, so the new film finds Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) casting 14-year-old puppy eyes in various directions.
Friendships are torn asunder by jealousy and suspicion. There's a school dance to which Hermione actually wears a gown. Ron takes one look at her and mutters, "They're scary when they're grown up, aren't they?"
More to the point, "Goblet of Fire" is the entry in which Rowling finally took off the gloves -- a much-liked character dies, Lord Voldemort returns from exile with powers strengthened -- and the movie rigorously follows suit. Entire plotlines and characters have been sliced off to fit the confines of a two-and-a-half-hour running time (Winky the Elf, we hardly knew ye), but the sense of impending doom remains.
Is this the best of the series? It's beside the point. Long as it is -- and the movie verges on overlong -- "Goblet of Fire" is the first that plays for keeps.
The director this time is not Chris Columbus, the proficient journeyman of the first two films, nor Alfonso Cuaron, who gave the third installment a dose of needed magic (which, ironically, pleased everyone except hard-core Potterheads), but Mike Newell, the British director of "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and "Donnie Brasco" (and "Mona Lisa Smile," but we'll let that slide, although Hogwarts could
 possibly pass for Wellesley College on a lousy day). Newell specializes in relationships rather than special effects, and, fittingly, "Goblet" is most interested in the curses and enchantments of adolescent behavior.
So while the movie starts off with a Quidditch World Cup bang, the sequence feels rushed and secondary, like a highlight reel of the book's opening chapters. Soon enough, Newell assembles the relevant troops: The students of two rival academies of magic convene at Hogwarts for a grand Triwizard Tournament, with one student from each school chosen by the Goblet of Fire to take part in an enchantment triathlon.
From Durmstrang comes Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), Quidditch star and glowering Slavic jock. From Madame Maxime's Beauxbatons comes Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy) -- think Ludwig Bemelman's Madeline all grown up and with a wicked knack for casting spells. And from Hogwarts comes Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), upperclassman, dreamboat, all-around good chap.
Then the Goblet has the effrontery to belch out one more name for the contest: Harry Potter. Because everyone assumes that Harry has engineered this development, all of Hogwarts turns against him in a fickle rage. Now this
 is adolescence: humiliation, isolation, an inflamed sense of social persecution that may or may not be deserved. Suddenly Harry is no longer the hero of the tale but its goat. All that's missing is acne.
The tournament's three contests provide the excuse for the expected state-of-the-art CGI whizzbangery, and they are visual marvels. A Hungarian Horntail dragon perched angrily atop Hogwarts' highest spire, a seaweedy underwater world of beastly mermaids, a maze of perversely mobile hedges -- these are images with staying power, like Arthur Rackham illustrations sprung to life. They don't feel multiplex-trendy but organic to the series' darkening tone.
The main order of business in "Goblet," though, is the sorting out of unwelcome new loves and lusts. Harry stammers whenever he sees classmate Cho Chang (underwhelming newcomer Katie Leung), while Krum sets his shako (again, not quite believably) for Hermione. Ron just sulks; the scene in which he and Harry double-team the Patil twins (Shefali Chowdhury and Afshan Azad) at the Yule Ball is a nice study in young male doltishness. Any sparks between Ron and Hermione, by the way, will apparently have to wait until the next movie.
Strip away the special effects and you could be watching an episode of "Degrassi Junior High," and is that such a bad thing? At times the movie squirms: Harry's encounter with ghostly Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson) in a fifth-floor bathtub flirts along the line between comedy of embarrassment and full-on kink. (That the 39-year-old Henderson has 23 years on Radcliffe makes the scene even more interestingly bent.) "Goblet" knows, though, that where some teenagers flounder others find their legs, and Harry's roommate Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) makes a touching entry into adulthood here.
As for the adults, Michael Gambon's Dumbledore has a greater presence in this film, but Professors McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and Snape (Alan Rickman) are forced to the back of the line. Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) indulges in a queasy romance with Madame Maxime (Frances de la Tour), who resembles nothing so much as a transvestite on stilts.
With any new "Potter" entry, the newcomers hog the stage, and luckily "Goblet" has two prize hams: Brendan Gleeson as Dark Arts professor Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody -- mad eye swinging like a marble in a shot glass -- and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, the perky tabloid journalist of any young wizard's nightmares.
And, of course, there's Voldemort, who rises from the depths of this film's climax like the devil himself. I'm not sure whose idea it was to cast Ralph Fiennes as the devil, but it's an inspired choice: bald, elegantly muscular, eerily noseless, and very, very unpleasant, this Voldemort provides a jolt that promises to last the entire series, wherever that may lead.
Is the movie for kids? Even with a PG-13 rating, "Goblet of Fire" is oddly less scary in some ways than last year's "Prisoner of Azkaban" -- less predicated on computer-generated ghoulies and funhouse shocks. The dread here cuts deeper, though. When we hear the wail of a grieving father toward the end of the movie, it's the first genuinely human moment in a "Harry Potter" film, and it is awful.
"Soon we must all face the choice between what is right and what is easy," Dumbledore tells his rattled charges, and with those words the franchise becomes no longer a corporate toy but a metaphor for growing up in a world where magic spells are never quite enough. "Everything's going to change now, isn't it?" asks Hermione. Yes, dear, it is.

         With the fantasy kicked up a notch and a new director, Harry Potter catches 'Fire.'It's taken them long enough, but the movies have finally gotten Harry Potter right. Despite the reported $2.7 billion earned by the series' three previous attempts, it's not until "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" that a film has successfully re-created the sense of stirring magical adventure and engaged, edge-of-your-seat excitement that has made the books such an international phenomenon.
 
  Viewed as a whole, the Potter movies are shaping up to be a fascinating experiment in big-budget filmmaking. Using the same J.K. Rowling source material, the same screenwriter (the excellent Steve Kloves), largely the same cast but a variety of directors, the Potter pictures have ended up reflecting the sensibility of their filmmaker more than that of the author.
 


         






    With the reliably commercial Chris Columbus in charge, the first two Potters were soulless but safe-as-houses copies of the books.
 
  The gifted Alfonso Cuarón attempted to escape the bonds of the conventional in "The Prisoner of Azkaban" but succeeded only in part.
 
  It has fallen to the veteran Mike Newell, eager, in his own words, "to break out of this goody-two-shoes feel," to make the first Harry Potter film to be wire-to-wire satisfying.
 
  Newell is an impeccable craftsman with four decades of cinematic experience, a veteran less concerned with projecting a lofty auteur sensibility than giving the best of his films, from the chilling "Dance With a Stranger" to the comic "Four Weddings and a Funeral," what they need from a practical point of view.
 
  The first thing the Hertfordshire-born Newell has added to the mix is a welcome sense of ownership of the book's setting. Having been a boarding school boy himself, Newell, the series' first British director, displays a comfort level with the world of Hogwarts that comes with knowing it in his bones.
 
  Newell works equally well with the preexisting cast and the film's new British actors, principally a convincing Ralph Fiennes as the dread Lord Voldemort, a comic Miranda Richardson as weaselly journalist Rita Skeeter and, best of all, Brendan Gleeson as the irrepressible Mad-Eye Moody, the latest in Hogwarts' notably eccentric series of Defense Against the Dark Arts instructors.
 
  The presence of Voldemort in the creepy-crawly flesh signals that this is the first Potter movie to have a PG-13 rating for "sequences of fantasy violence and frightening images." Fortunately, "Goblet" is not an R-rated movie trying to pass as something tamer but a genuine PG-13, pleasantly shivery but in no way savage or sadistic.
 
  Newell also proves to be adept at bringing a feeling of page-turning propulsion to a grittier than usual narrative that, courtesy of one of the series' better plots, is rife with convincing jeopardy situations.
 
  The danger starts at the Quidditch World Cup, where the festivities are marred by rioting by Voldemort's Death Eaters and the appearance of his Dark Mark in the sky.
 
  That Quidditch match, the 422nd to be exact, is also the first tipoff as to how special "Goblet's" special effects are going to be. The enormous stadium where the match is held seems appropriately both in and out of this world, and it sets the stage for a series of magical moments — including the magnificent Durmstrang sailing ship rising out of the lake and the dozen winged horses drawing the gigantic Beauxbatons carriage — that are to come.
 
  When Harry says "I love magic," we can see just what he's talking about.
 
  The wizarding schools arriving by ship and coach have come to Hogwarts for the legendary Triwizard Tournament — "eternal glory awaits the winner," promises headmaster Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) — that is the spine of "Goblet's" plot and the excuse for considerable amounts of magic and excitement.
 
  Through a series of unlikely events, Harry gets to participate in the tournament and has to contend with a trio of exceptionally daunting tasks. The young wizard has to perform heroically underwater, deal with a claustrophobic, mind-altering maze and evade a terrifying Hungarian Horntail dragon so realistic that the film's "No dragons were harmed in the making of this film" disclaimer in the closing credits seems more valid than tongue-in-cheek.
 
  "Goblet of Fire" was the first Potter novel to weigh in at the whopping 600-page-plus length that has become standard, and though many events have been eliminated, including those always irritating house elves, "Goblet" the film is still longer than it should be at two hours and 34 minutes.
 
  Ripe for cutting is the picture's weakest element, its exploration of the agonies of early teen dating and friendship. The film's heart simply is not in questions like how long Ron (Rupert Grint) and Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) will stay mad at each other, and a little romantic awkwardness among 14-year-olds goes an awfully long way.
 
  This is especially true because Emma Watson's Hermione has grown into easily the most attractive student on campus, so far removed from the books' insistence that she is a plain and bossy girl that it makes a complete hash of the sections of the plot dealing with her social life.
 
  Though memorable acting is neither called for nor delivered on the part of "Goblet's" collection of juveniles, Radcliffe's Harry does get one thing exactly right. Watching him face myriad challenges, we're convinced that Harry's heart will lead him to do the right thing. He does good in the most natural way and, like so much of "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," that's just how it should be.

It's a paradox of the Harry Potter  films that they're made with such slavish devotion to the books, as if J.K. Rowling's fans would launch a megaplex riot at any violation of the sacred text, yet for all of that literal-minded fealty the final effect of the films is worlds removed from what's on the page. When you read Rowling, her tartly deadpan British commonsensical voice grounds the wizardry, making it seem almost funny in its matter-of-factness. Even as minor a bit of business as Harry's name appearing on a shred of paper as it gets spit out of the Goblet of Fire  is conveyed with a twinkle, a subliminal wink of delight. In the movie version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , directed by Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral , Donnie Brasco ), that moment is just another processed effect from the digital factory, delivered straight up, with no more wit or enchantment than a hundred other F/X in a hundred other throwaway youth-fantasy films  like, for instance, the genially prankish Herbie: Fully Loaded . The Potter  books take place in a dowdy real world where magical things simply... happen. The movies, with the glorious semi-exception of director Alfonso Cuarón's luscious third chapter, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban , unfold in a stagey, all-magic-all-the-time zone interrupted by functional clunks of reality. These films get the notes but not the melody.
In Goblet of Fire , Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), who at 14 looks more like a young Steven Spielberg than ever, has been chosen by some mystical unknown force to be the only underage contestant in the Triwizard Tournament, in which students from a handful of wizard prep academies compete in a trio of lethally dangerous tasks. The first challenge is a doozy: Harry, surrounded by spectators in a stone gladiatorial pit, must outwit a huge dragon and retrieve its golden egg. It's a rousingly tactile face-off, with Harry leaping out of the way of giant horns and fiery breaths and then jumping onto his Quidditch broom to lead the dragon on a madly fractious choreographed chase through the air.
As grand as that duel is, the film peaks a little too soon. Newell, unlike Cuarón, jams sequences together like bricks of LEGO, without giving the story an emotional flow. The other Triwizard labors are all staged as hermetic set pieces, with each one a little less exciting than the last. The biggest disappointment of Goblet of Fire  is that Harry's first romantic stirrings, stoked by his new celebrity status as a Triwizard competitor and also by the suddenly dolled-up appearance of Hermione (Emma Watson) at a Hogwarts ball, are every bit as self-contained as the action. Young love, having finally reared its head, becomes just another LEGO block.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  does have its quota of antic marvels. Brendan Gleeson, as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor Alastor ''Mad-Eye'' Moody, gives an amusingly twitchy performance from behind his roving fake eyeball, and seeing the face of Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, as a mask of molten fireplace embers is a lovely effect. As Professor Minerva McGonagall, Maggie Smith savors the dotty logic of lines like ''We never use transfiguration as a punishment!'' Newell has a gift for light comedy, and he knows just how to release the sour-ball charm of his fellow Brits. He's less good at the darkness, especially when Ralph Fiennes, under a heavy glaze of very bad waxy makeup (or, quite possibly, bad CGI), ultimately emerges from the shadows  and from Harry's recurring nightmare  as the fearsome Lord Voldemort. Kids may be appropriately terrified, but to this overgrown Potter  fan, Voldemort, the Darth Vader of the black arts, was a heck of a lot scarier when you couldn't see him.

 Childhood ends for Harry Potter, the young wizard with the zigzag scar and phantasmagorical world of troubles, not long after the dragons have roared and the merpeople have screeched their empty threats through broken teeth. And, as in the book "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" on which this latest and happily satisfying film adaptation is based, childhood ends with screams and a final shudder in a graveyard crowded with tombstones and evil. In a scene of startling intensity, one boy dies while another is delivered from the malevolent force that has steadily wended its way through J. K. Rowling's series toward its prey.  This is the second time that Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), now 14, has experienced childhood's end, of course, as Ms. Rowling and the directors of all four films have reminded us. Orphaned at 1 by the malevolent wizard Lord Voldemort, Harry has developed over the years, books and films from a sentimental Dickensian figure into a prickly adolescent for whom girls now present almost as serious a problem as the Dark Lord. As those who have cracked the spines of the books know, their genius rests as much in Harry's dual identity as in Ms. Rowling's grasp on the fantastic: at once susceptibly human and wholly alien, a geeky outsider and an awesomely cool kid, Harry holds up a mirror to those who curl up with books and congregate in theaters, taking flight in their imaginations.  As did the last film, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," the new one opens and ends on an ominous note. In "Azkaban," a giant tree whacks a bird out of the air both at the start and at the close; in "Goblet of Fire," it's people who get whacked. These poor creatures are not in the novel, but they cleverly bookend "Azbakan," setting the stage for the scarier, more dire and serious story immediately to follow, as well as for the darker stories yet to come. If the world of the first two installments, "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" and "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," both directed by the aggressively upbeat Chris Columbus, represented some kind of paradise for the boy wizard, it was a paradise that, we come to see, would soon be lost.  The slithering snake and shivering caretaker who inaugurate "The Goblet of Fire" make it clear that the PG action has been ratcheted up to PG-13. Like his predecessor, Alfonso Cuarón, who brought new beauty and depth to the series, the director Mike Newell embraces the saga's dark side with flair. This time, the story pivots on the Triwizard Tournament, a competition that finds Harry risking life and limb against three young challengers and a litany of more menacing foes. In between feats of derring-do with digitally enhanced dragons, there are dining-room flirtations, schoolyard confrontations and a gaggle of visiting girls who line up like so many Madelines, only to break ranks like La Femme Nikita. There are also the usual growing pains and, somewhat less thrillingly, no small amount of teenage angst.  Now 16, Mr. Radcliffe pouts reasonably well, but has yet to develop the skill to make that pouting feel emotionally substantive. This might pose a serious obstacle for the films, but it hasn't yet, largely because watching him and his young co-stars - the excellent Rupert Grint as Ron, the touchingly earnest Emma Watson as Hermione - grow up onscreen has its dividends. Cinema doesn't just immortalize actors, locking them into youth, it also solicits our love in a way that books do not, since it isn't just the characters we fall for, but the actors playing them, too. Mr. Radcliffe isn't an acting titan or even one of the Culkins, but you root for him nonetheless, partly because you want Harry to triumph and partly because there is something poignant about how this actor struggles alongside his character.  If the lead attraction remains somewhat unsteady on his feet, one of the constant pleasures of the films, and one of the benefits of the big Hollywood money behind them, has been their pedigreed talent. Among the British sirs, dames and quality hams returning to the series are Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Timothy Spall and Gary Oldman, whose brief appearance is sadly little more than a tease. New to the scene are Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, a snoopy journalist who is mainly on hand to remind us that Harry is no longer a child, and Brendan Gleeson as the latest addition to the Hogwarts staff, Mad-Eye Moody. A man of garrulous temperament and removable parts, including a googly eye that he wears like a pirate's patch, Mad-Eye is a pip.  As good as these actors are, nothing prepares you for the malevolent force that is Lord Voldemort and the brilliance of the actor playing him, Ralph Fiennes. Dressed in a flowing black robe that seems to float off his body rather than hang, Mr. Fiennes moves with lissome grace, his smooth white head bobbing like a cork on a sea, his fluttery hands and feet as pale and bright as beacons. For years, the movies have tried to transform this delicate beauty into a heartthrob, but as "Schindler's List" proved, Mr. Fiennes is an actor for whom a walk on the darker side is not just a pleasure, but liberation. His Voldemort may be the greatest screen performance ever delivered without the benefit of a nose; certainly it's a performance of sublime villainy.  Mr. Fiennes enters the film spectacularly, if regrettably late, whooshing into that crowded graveyard like a Butoh dancer from hell. He brings the film to an unsettling close, one that doesn't so much polish off the story as leave it in tatters. That's to the good of the film and the series, since each new story has to satisfy on its own terms as well as prime us for the next installment. If Mr. Cuarón raised the series to a new level with "Azbakan," Mr. Newell, best known for ingratiating mainstream fare like "Four Weddings and a Funeral" and best remembered for the bracing likes of "Donnie Brasco," manages to keep his contribution at a similarly high level of enthrallment. The gloom and doom may be less poetically realized, but the combination of British eccentricity, fatalism and steady-on pluck remains irresistibly intact.  "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Appreciably more violent than the first three films, this chapter includes two human deaths, including that of a teenager. 
It begins in nightmare and ends in a labyrinth, a shape right out of Borges. Along the way, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire , the fourth filmed installment of J.K. Rowling 's still-unfolding boy-wizard saga, pulls out all the stops, relentlessly spinning adolescent terrors into metaphor: whiplash teleportation, dragons and disguises, octopoid nasties, screaming golden eggs, and a clammy-palmed interlude of ballroom dancing. Like a dream, it's everywhere and nowhere, by turns scarily intense and scattered. It yearns for forbidden space, delivering an underwater dumb show, a roof-clinging melee, a graveside revelation. If the entire Potter enterprise is a cash cow, at least it's one with two heads and three or four tails. To this viewer and reader, the decade-old juggernaut is as deeply felt as it is flawed, dense and illogical and laudably weird .
By this point, surely, you're either in or you're out: Those who haven't kept up with the Potteriad shouldn't take their first sip at the Goblet . Given the sheer cumulative density of plot points and players, Number Four sometimes only has time (even at nearly two and a half hours) to allude to past actions and characterizations. Even Harry's hotly anticipated nascent love interest, Cho Chang  (Katie Leung , sporting a killer Scottish accent), gets shunted to the wings. Things frequently move too fastwho are the Death Eaters , again?even for the initiated. But as far as backstory goes, the only one that matters is Harry's, repeatedly (if not always clearly) referenced here: the death of his parents at the hands of Lord Voldemort , an attack that the infant Harry mystifyingly survived. The series' obsession with this primal wound, which started out as a mainline to everyone's deep-seated dread of orphanhood, here reaches its delirious, histrionic peak.
Goblet 's setup isn't particularly inspired. Contingents from two wizardry schoolsan Eastern European manly-man academy and a French girls' seminaryvisit Hogwarts  for the Triwizard Tournament, revived after a century of neglect. The eponymous vessel (a cover version of the sorting hat in Sorcerer's Stone ) spits forth the name of one upperclassperson from each schooland for some reason taps the underage Harry (Daniel Radcliffe ) as well. The contest is borderline sadistic, less a test of imagination than grit, at one point recalling the hold-your-breath torture sessions of Fear Factor , if not the Saw  franchise.
It's hard to believe that any educational program outside the Navy SEALs  would condone (let alone enshrine) such a brutal tradition. Still, as we settle into the framework, it becomes clear how the tourney's structured violence mirrors the ferocious energies coursing through Goble t 's subterranean storyline, which focuses on the advent of Voldemort, a/k/a He Who Must Not Be Named, a/a/k/a You Know Who. (At the very least, this triathlon beats having to watch another inning of Quidditch.)
Unlike the lapidary events of Middle-earth (or Narnia ), Rowling's imaginings as yet have no end. The relatively quick book-to-film transfer, and the growing length and looser structures of her tomes, mean that despite all the filters of publishing and producing, what we're getting has a strange, ineradicable rawness. As Harry, Radcliffe is a touch less petulant than previously, but he's still not quite likable, a half-contained id itching for a fight, with I suppose the superego and ego roles filled by his more accessible buds, Hermione (Emma Watson ) and Ron (Rupert Grint , sporting Jagger-esque 'do). And though Ralph Fiennes 's suitably creepy Voldemort has no nose, the whole savage mess still smells like teen spirit.
