In the past few weeks, advance word for The Hangover
 has gone beyond good buzz to full-on sonic boom. You could feel it in the audience at Monday night's public sneak � an almost punchy anticipation, a predetermination to laugh some ass off. (Hello, Hard-R Comedy. We've been expecting you.
) Yet Phillips makes a startling stylistic choice in the film's opening minutes, one that punctures assumptions about what kind of comedy The Hangover
 is peddling. In L.A., a nervous bride takes a call on the morning of her wedding day. It's groomsman Phil (Cooper) � dirty, split-lipped, and 300 miles away in the Mojave Desert. His voice cracks as he explains to his best friend's fianc�e why they won't be making it to the ceremony: "We fucked up." Then Phillips cues the opening credits � dead-serious font set against menacing shots of bleached-out desert and garish Vegas nightscapes, tuned to a Danzig's metal dirge "Thirteen" ("I was born in the soul of misery" � oy). The sequence has an uneasy effect on the viewer, like the air just got sucked out of the room; it's also devilishly effective in upending expectations. The Hangover
 is deliciously darker than Phillips' previous comedies, Old School
 and Road Trip
, but it isn't as thick with malice as those credits suggest (this is not, thankfully, Very Bad Things 2: Hey Guys, Let's Kill Some More Strippers
). It may be misdirection, but what it most truly announces is that anything goes and nothing is sacred � save, of course, the bond between men. "Bromance" is too dopey of a word for what goes on here; as with Phillips' earlier films, The Hangover
 honors the significance of male friendship without insisting on its primacy. The occasion here is the Vegas-set bachelor party for Doug (Bartha), organized by his three groomsmen: Phil, straitlaced Stu (The Office
's Helms), and Doug's non-sequitur-spouting future brother-in-law, Alan (the sublime Galifianakis, so outr� he's toeing performance art here). They all have their private issues � Alan is lonely and socially simple-minded; Stu is rutted in a relationship with a chronic emasculator; and Phil, dickish and bullying, turns his dissatisfaction with himself onto others � but they intend to put all that aside for a night they'll never forget. That is, until they wake the next morning, surrounded by the spoils of the previous night (a scorched hotel suite, a missing tooth, a tiger in the bathroom), but with zero recollection of how it all happened. An edgier film could have been carved out of that premise, but you'd be hard-pressed to find one as consistently, relentlessly funny. It's early yet for this kind of declaration, but what the hell: Co-screenwriters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who also wrote last month's indisputably awful Ghosts of Girlfriends Past
, just may have scripted both the summer's high point and its ditch-dead bottom. No worries: Ghosts
 is all but forgotten already, and The Hangover
 instantly has the feel of one for the ages.

About 15 minutes into "The Hangover," the movie arrives at the scene that unquestionably served as the screenwriters' initial inspiration. It's a worst-case-scenario of bachelor party morning-after, and it is howlingly funny. A blow-up doll floats in the Jacuzzi, and a chicken struts through the living room. One of the chairs is on fire. There's a tiger in the bathroom. You don't want to know what's in the closet.
The damning evidence keeps piling up: a hospital bracelet, a missing tooth, a stolen police car, and we still haven't heard the half of it. We're in urban legend territory here. "The Hangover" is about the kind of mythic epic catastrophe frat boys might swear really happened to a bunch of seniors who graduated two years ago. The wreckage might be easily explained, too, if any of the movie's three principals had the slightest memory of what happened.
No such luck: A 12-hour black hole separates them from the night before. The worst part? The groom has gone missing.
The latest in the wave of post-Judd Apatow Bad Lad comedies, "The Hangover" is rowdy, scurrilous, and, for about three-quarters of its running time, a lot more hilarious than it has any right to be. The characters are stock road-movie stereotypes but they're performed with gusto and finesse, and as long as the movie keeps throwing surreal curveballs, we're kept breathlessly off-balance.
The setup is basic. Four friends hit Las Vegas for the proverbial last blast before one of them, the generically handsome Doug (Justin Bartha), gets hitched. We have your raffish alpha-dog stud, Phil (Bradley Cooper), a married schoolteacher who acts like he's still in college; the whiny nerd, Stu (Ed Helms of "The Office"), complete with a nightmare shrew of a girlfriend (Rachael Harris); and the designated wildman, Alan (Zach Galifianakis), the bride's brother and a bearded man-child who suggests John Belushi crossed with Rain Man.
As written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore and directed by Todd Phillips, "The Hangover" plays out as a sun-drenched comic mystery: What the hell happened and in what order? Daytime being Las Vegas' equivalent of night, oddball characters keep jumping out of the cracks of strip malls and hotel rooms. We meet an emergency room doctor (Matt Walsh) who really has seen it all, and a dishy, exuberant wedding chapel proprietor (Bryan Callen). At one point, a Very Special Guest Star turns up playing himself, and his presence, bizarre as it is, makes no more or less sense than anything else here.
If half the laughs come from that what-next shock, the other half rises from the interplay between unflappable Phil, moaning Stu, and blissfully weird Alan  - they're the Three Stooges of wedding comedies. All you have to do is drop the characters into a setting (a police station, say, with an elementary-school tour passing through) and wait for the inevitable combustion. Cooper successfully advances on his quest to be a leading man and Helms is ingratiatingly funny, but Galifianakis is the secret weapon of "The Hangover," delivering scabrously tasteless one-liners  - there's one about a grandmother's heirloom ring I can't even repeat  - in a beatific daze.
After a while, the question becomes how long the movie can sustain itself and whether the payoff of explanation will be worth the slow build-up of inexplicable  events. The answer is: not really. "The Hangover" arguably peaks with the opening of a car trunk, a scene that uncorks the most outrageous of the film's jack-in-the-box belly laughs, and then it slowly loses steam, becoming more ordinary as the pieces come together. More mean-spirited, too, with thin ethnic stereotypes (Mike Epps' drug dealer, Ken Cheong's gay Asian gangsta) and a virgin/whore complex so confused that the virgin (Harris's castrating Tina Fey-look-alike) is more of a whore than the whore (Heather Graham as the sweetest escort in all of Las Vegas).
What's missing is the slap-happy humanism of Apatow bad-boy movies like "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and "Knocked Up" (or even a non-Apatow project like the recent "I Love You, Man")  - a general acknowledgement that everyone's digging their way out of the same mess. But maybe that's too much to expect from the writing team that gave us the shrill knucklehead comedy of "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past" and "Four Christmases." The surprise of "The Hangover" isn't that it eventually hits the wall but that it comes so close to deliriously vaulting over.

Going to Las Vegas for a ''wild'' bachelor party is now the ultimate middle-class hedonist cliché. It's not just that the jaunt has been done so often, in the movies as well as in life. It's that there's a contradiction embedded in the lure of the Vegas bacchanal. Men  and women too, of course  go there to be as reckless as humanly possible. But the naughtiness is so organized  that there's not much recklessness left in it. Sure, you can craps-table your way to financial ruin, but the lap dances, the glorified college drinking binges, the ritualized ordering of hookers: It's all about as spontaneous as a shuffleboard tournament on a cruise ship.
The fun of The Hangover   what makes it more than just one what-happens-in-Vegas romp too many  is that the film completely understands all this. The four comrades who drive from Los Angeles to the Nevada desert to prepare for the wedding of Doug (Justin Bartha) aren't daring or cool; they aren't born swingers. They're an unglamorous Everyguy quartet, doing what they all think they’re supposed to do. They're probably imitating Vegas movies as much as those films imitated reality.
Phil (Bradley Cooper), the one who's good-looking enough to strut into a casino like he owns it, is a junior-high teacher devoted to his wife and kid; Stu (Ed Helms), the group dweeb, is an anxious-eyed dentist who's like the 21st-century version of American Graffiti 's Terry the Toad, with a fascist girlfriend (Rachael Harris) who treats him like a slave; and Alan (Zach Galifianakis), so brick-stupid he qualifies as more nutzoid than dorkish, is a pudgy, bearded runt who stands up in the group's cruising convertible and shouts ''Road trip!'' That's an inside nod to the fact that Todd Phillips, the movie's director, made Road Trip  as well, though it also indicates that these four think they're living inside a stupid teen comedy.
They arrive at their hotel, and the film then cuts to the next day, when they wake up in their trashed villa. There's a tiger in the bathroom, and a baby in the cabinet. Stu is missing his top right incisor; the groom is nowhere to be seen. And the thing is, none of them remembers...anything. The Hangover  is structured, basically, as one long morning-after OMG what have I done? , and the kick of the film is that the discovery of what the characters have, in fact, done becomes the perfect comeuppance to their tidy fantasy of Vegas bliss. A light-buttered comic nightmare, like Martin Scorsese's After Hours  (or Peter Berg's scandalous, overlooked Very Bad Things  with things not nearly so bad), The Hangover  is a riff on what the stuff you do when you're really  out of control says about you.
The surprises in this movie are everything, so without giving much away, I'll just say that a Vegas chapel figures into the mix. So does a crowbar-wielding Asian gangster (Ken Jeong) who might be the epicene brother of Long Duk Dong in Sixteen Candles . There's also a juicy run-in with Mike Tyson. The Hangover  has scattered laughs (many in the cathartically funny end-credit montage), but overall it's more amusing than hilarious. The most deftly acted character is Stu, played by Helms with a realistic alternating current of horror and liberation. As Alan, Zach Galifiannakis makes blinkered idiocy a cartoon rush, though a little of him goes a long way. I wish Phillips, working from a script by the knockabout team of Jon Lucas and Scott Moore (Ghosts of Girlfriends Past ), had nudged the characters closer to being a true shaggy-dog Apatow-style ensemble. You're always a little too aware that they're types. But it's fun seeing each of them have the ''fun'' they deserve.

 The immaturity of ostensibly grown-up American men is an inexhaustible subject, or at least one that has yet to exhaust American movie audiences and the well-paid guys who cater to their entertainment needs. Todd Phillips, the director of “Old School,” “Road Trip” and an HBO  documentary called “Frat House” as well as a writer of “Borat,” has shown himself to be an adept and tireless connoisseur of male boorishness and stupidity, though the crude humor he dispenses is frequently leavened by nuggets of inventiveness and wit.  So I should say up front that “The Hangover,” Mr. Phillips’s new movie (written by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, who  contributed to the shockingly nonterrible script of “Four Christmases” and wrote the less surprisingly dreadful script of “Ghosts of Girlfriends Past”) is often very funny. This is partly thanks to the three principal actors, Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis, who incarnate familiar masculine stereotypes in ways that manage to be moderately fresh as well as soothingly familiar.  Mr. Helms is the anxious, nerdy dude — a dentist only because making him an accountant would deprive the film of a choice tooth-extraction gag — who lives in cowering terror of his bossy, judgmental girlfriend (Rachel Harris). Mr. Galifianakis is the childlike loser whose borderline-creepy non sequiturs are more hilarious the less sense they make. But it is Mr. Cooper who offers the most interesting variation on an old standard, playing his aggressive, cocky frat boy with a snarl of rage that masks an anxiety as hard to account for as it is to miss.  These three — Stu (Mr. Helms), Phil (Mr. Cooper) and Alan (Mr. Galifianakis) — drive to Las Vegas from Los Angeles with another buddy, Doug (Justin Bartha), who seems much better adjusted than the others, which is to say blander and duller, and who mercifully vanishes for most of the picture. Doug is about to get married, and a wild bachelor weekend spins out of control.  Phil, Stu and Alan wake up to find their luxury suite at Caesars Palace a shambles, with a tiger in the bathroom, a baby in the closet and a chicken scratching around the detritus of what looks to have been quite a bacchanal. Stu has a missing incisor, Phil has a hospital bracelet around his wrist, and Doug is nowhere to be found. What on earth could have happened?  In answering that question “The Hangover” peaks early and runs out of steam long before the end. This is probably inevitable, since even the craziest stuff has a way of becoming less so in the course of being explained. Still, there are some moments of dizzying, demented lunacy, most of them immune to being spoiled by mere verbal description. (The verbal jokes I will leave for you to discover and repeat with your co-workers in the break room.)  Mike Tyson shows up to sing along with a Phil Collins song. Mr.  Galifianakis is tasered. So are the other two. By schoolchildren on a field trip. Have I ruined anything? No, I’ve just whetted your appetite.  But true to its title, “The Hangover” goes down smoothly enough and then kicks you in the head later on, when you start to examine the sources of your laughter.  There’s the easy, lazy trafficking in broad ethnic caricature — Mike Epps as a black drug dealer, Ken Jeong as a prancing, lisping Asian gangster known as Mr. Chow — which  is decked out in flimsy air quotes to make it seem as if the movie is making fun of racism.  And the movie, for all its queasiness about male bodies and the thin line between friendship and, you know, other stuff, can’t be called homophobic either. It is much more panicked by the idea of heterosexuality, from whose terrors and traps the whole Vegas adventure is an escape.  The city itself is not a place of sin but rather, for Stu, Phil and Alan, an Eden of the narcissistic, infantile id.  Alan, in spite of his heavy beard, is almost literally a giant baby, his soft-bellied body appearing  swaddled in a sheet and, most memorably, in a jockstrap that looks like a badly applied diaper. Until the end credits — which shuffle through still photographs from a harder-edged, more nastily and candidly adult movie — the on-screen nudity consists of male buttocks and a woman’s breast in the mouth of a nursing infant. This pretty much sums up the movie’s psychosexual condition, which old-school Freudians might identify as pregenital, more preoccupied with eating and elimination than with, you know, other stuff.  The tiny handful of women who have speaking roles in “Hangover” may at first seem to be conventional figures in the straight-male imaginary — the sweet and patient bride; the emasculating, hypocritical shrew; the friendly prostitute (a sunny Heather Graham) — but they are all really incarnations of mommy. There is a bad mommy who won’t let you play, a good mommy who cleans up your mess and kisses your boo-boos and an extra special mommy who offers you her nipple even when you don’t pay for it as most of the other kids do. What hangover? This movie is safe as milk.  “The Hangover” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Bad words and naughty stuff no child would be dumb enough to try.

The trailers and TV spots suggest it's just another beer-and-boobs, party-hearty farce, but "The Hangover" is surprisingly clever as well as R-rated rowdy. At once raucously free-wheeling and meticulously contrived, pic satisfies as a boys-gone-wild laff riot that also clicks as a seriocomic beat-the-clock detective story. Reviews and word-of-mouth could help this profanely funny comedy exceed expectations and achieve the status of breakout hit. Homevid biz should be equally impressive after a leggy summertime theatrical run.
Helmer Todd Phillips ("Old School," "Road Trip") grabs attention right from the get-go with an edgy-funny prologue that triggers an extended flashback. It's a smart move, in that the vaguely foreboding intro adds an intriguing undercurrent to the comedy in otherwise ordinary (if not generic) expository scenes.
Two days before he ties the knot with his rich and gorgeous fiancee, blandly affable Doug (Justin Bartha) takes off for a brief Las Vegas sojourn with three groomsmen: His two best buddies -- Phil (Bradley Cooper), a cynical and sardonic high school teacher, and Stu (Ed Helms), a dentist usually kept on a tight leash by his nagging girlfriend (a truly monstrous Rachel Harris) -- and Alan (Zach Galifianakis), Doug's future brother-in-law, a lumpy lunk who's all too eager to befriend and belong.
Even with odd-man-out Alan along for the ride, the bachelor-partiers enjoy a wild night of booze-fueled revelry in Sin City. The next morning, however, three of them awaken in their posh hotel suite with only the haziest of memories about the previous evening's events, and no explanation at all for the snarling tiger in their bathroom and the crying baby in their closet.
Worse, they have no earthly idea what happened to the inexplicably missing Doug.
Exhibiting an ingenuity one might not expect from the same writers who gave us "Four Christmases" and "Ghosts of Girlfriends Past," scripters Jon Lucas and Scott Moore provide one uproarious pay-off after another as the groomsmen frantically scramble to retrace their steps so they can reconnect with the misplaced (or, quite possibly, waylaid) groom.
Their circuitous journey brings them in contact with, among others, Taser-wielding cops, angry Asian gamblers, a perky stripper (a chipper Heather Graham) with newly forged ties to Stu, and an unexpectedly equanimous but not infinitely patient Mike Tyson (played, in a bold stroke of casting, by Tyson).
Early on, it's revealed that the revelers weren't merely drunk, they were drugged while cutting an antic swath through the Vegas night world. Oddly enough, that's just enough to anchor the pic in something like real-world logic, even as the plot takes ever more outlandish twists and turns. In fact, it's tempting to read "The Hangover" as a wild-and-crazy spin on a scenario that would have been entirely suitable for a deadly serious '40s film noir.
The humor is unapologetically raunchy -- a closing-credits photo montage includes some borderline NC-17 naughtiness -- and sporadically brutal. Helmer Phillips sustains an overall tone of anything-goes swagger that he neatly subverts with steadily mounting desperation and ego-deflating humiliations. Throughout it all, however, Cooper, Helms and even Galifianakis (whose character comes closest to caricature) remain sufficiently disciplined to refrain from going too far over the top.
Bartha does well in a thankless role, but he's simply not visible long enough to make as much impact. On the other hand, Ken Jeong makes the absolute most of his limited screen time as an effete antagonist whose mincing trash talk likely will be quoted extensively by the pic's fans.
Lenser Lawrence Sher does an excellent job of subtly enhancing the sense of danger lying just below the comic surface. Other tech credits are fine. Jokey references to "Rain Man" and "A Beautiful Mind" are amusing, but not nearly as funny as the pic's self-aware reference to the cliched notion that there's nothing as hilarious as a pratfall by a fat man.

What Fletch  was to plaid-checked watercooler wits in the '80s, what National Lampoon's Van Wilder  was to college-bound douches at the dawn of Dubya, that's what 2003's Old School  is to Gen-X frat rats—a secret-handshake movie. A shaggy, intermittently hilarious wish-fulfillment nightmare about sorta dissatisfied, sorta middle-aged dudesters trying to capture the Ghost of Keggers Past by running their own frat house, director Todd Phillips 's squirmy comedy struck a nerve with almost every forty-ish daddy I know. It captured the gnawing suspicion among the newly gray that whatever fun we're having can't possibly measure up to the fun we're supposed to be having—or, worse, the fun we were supposed to have had way back when.
To allay those fears in all of us, there's America's rec-room—the beacon of Las Vegas , promising a wallow in Caligulan depravity (plus comped buffets!). That would make it the perfect setting for an Old School 2 —and in Phillips's The Hangover , it arguably is. A second slice of three-handed men-will-be-toddlers tomfoolery, just as uneven and almost as funny, this messy, raunchy farce about three groomsmen on a lost-weekend bender in Sin City continues the director's fascination with the alpha male's default setting—childhood reversion. To put it another way: This is a movie about three yutzes who go to Vegas for a bachelor party, lose the groom, and wake up face-down in a high rollers' suite with live chickens, a smoldering armchair, and a Jacuzzi full of inflatable livestock.
Dude, where's my groom? Ringleader Phil (Bradley Cooper ), a teacher who siphons gambling money off his grade-schoolers, has a hospital bracelet, but no memory. Henpecked Stu (Ed Helms ), a dentist—sorry, doctor! —all but floss-bound to his suspicious fiancée, has an $800 ATM receipt, but is missing a tooth. Found it! It's in the pocket of Alan (Zach Galifianakis ), the bride's brother and an incorrigible skeev.
As their search for groom Doug (Justin Bartha ) leads from cut-rate wedding chapel to no-tell motel, the screenplay, by hot high-concept-of-the-moment team Jon Lucas  and Scott Moore  (Ghosts of Girlfriends Past , Four Christmases ), strives mightily to strew banana peels in their path—most amusing, some merely desperate.
What proves consistent, as it did in Old School , is the chemistry among Hangover 's three species of party mammalia. Cooper, well-cast as the detestable Sack in Wedding Crashers , has the smarmy look of an avocational gynecologist; his Phil  is the closest thing the movie has to a straight man, wedged in between a Felix Unger  neatnik and an Oscar Madison  slob. As the former, Helms uses his wall-mounted Whiffenpoof features to manic effect, with a girlish shriek for each new catastrophe. As the latter, the ursine Galifianakis, a master at detonating sicko one-liners with a slow fuse, adopts a gut-forward toddle and an air of guileless hedonism. (He's left in charge of an abandoned baby, who rides on his chest as a human airbag; the astoundingly inappropriate trick he teaches the little guy leaves no doubt why he's persona non grata at Chuck E. Cheese.) Together, they form a lopsided portrait of flabby, shabby wannabe machismo—an instant rejoinder to the old taunt "man up."
That makes them ideal subjects for director Phillips, among whose earliest films was the still-startling Frat House —a 1998 documentary for which the director underwent Hell Week hazing on camera, and emerged with a grudging love-hate for his "brothers" that was not unlike Stockholm  Syndrome. Starting with his teen-sex opus Road Trip , he's given himself perverted little cameos in his features, as if to remind mainstream viewers of his roots in the New York Underground Film Festival and the GG Allin  documentary Hated . But the feeling that comes through in his megaplex movies, from Road Trip  on, is closer to late, mellow John Waters . He can't bring himself to push the material into truly outré territory, or to characterize his growth-impaired guys as degenerate creeps rather than lovable scamps.
If that gives The Hangover  a certain failure of nerve, it also makes the movie, like Old School  and Road Trip , an unusually palatable entry in a rancid genre. Phillips's use of his Vegas locale is pretty facile, but at least he draws on the iconography of the celluloid Strip, from Rain Man  to Casino , to show his characters struggling to meet the culture-set standards of "what happens in Vegas"—not a bad metaphor for being a man. It would resonate more if The Hangover 's female characters weren't such nonentities: Either they're two-timing, ball-busting sluts (Rachael Harris  as Stu's girl deserves hazard pay), easy-going, nurturing whores (Heather Graham 's part evaporates on-screen), or glorified extras. But considering what passes for a man's, man's, man's world in Todd Phillips's movies, women may feel grateful for their relative absence.
