John G. Young's sophomore outing "The Reception" (after 1998's "Parallel Sons"), an imposing no-budget four-hander, unfolds with authority and grace. An odd couple, an alcoholic French woman and a gay black American painter sharing affection and pain in a country house in upper state New York, are visited by her estranged daughter with new black hubby in tow. While the dialogue-heavy, two-couples-in-a-single-location, "Virginia Woolf"-ish setup inevitably implies filmed theater, "Reception" cinematically embraces its artificial isolation. Superb emotional thesping complements script's measured restraint, but in the absence of name players Strand's skedded limited summer release will rely on critical support. 
When relatively sober, Jeannette (Pamela Holden Stewart) exudes knowing charm and wry self-awareness that are extremely attractive. Terrified of being alone, she clings to Martin (Wayne Lamont Sims), whose compassion seems infinite. Indeed, he can be counted on to forgive her for her frequent inebriated attacks of virulent truth-telling.
Martin, in turn, suffers secretly from painter's block. He rationalizes that his creative paralysis is due to his need to be there for Jeannette. Their locked-in co-dependency is shattered by the arrival of Jeannette's long-alienated daughter Sierra (Margaret Burkwit) and her supposed new husband Andrew (Darien Sills-Evans).
Young doesn't deal in big dramatic revelations, his characters' evasions, lies and half-truths amounting to little more than the small change of emotional dysfunction. Giving his actors plenty of breathing room, he allows them to develop organically, never rushing them into confrontations or tell-all self-explanations. Confidently cooking gourmet meals or contemplatively chopping wood, they possess an inner self-sufficiency that plays well onscreen.
Sim's Martin is particularly affecting, his face radiating sympathy and tenderness with just enough self-hatred to give his personality a slightly problematic edge. Stewart's Jeannette is so convincingly Gallic in inflection, in gesture, and in what she takes for granted that her ultra-Anglo name comes as something of a shock.
Nuanced line readings, comfortable silences and concisely referenced backstories further take the pressure off the need for heavy signifying. Amazingly free of the bitterness that often informs such claustrophobic gabfests, pic finally and decisively espouses intimacy over confrontation, any excess touchy-feely sentimentality channeled into unexpected sexual pairings.
At a time when Hollywood's attempts to slickly mainstream "adult" relationship films about artists and artsy intellectuals ("Door in the Floor" "We Don't Live Here Anymore," "Closer") are hamstrung by a dour, almost unconscious Puritanism, Young's small-scale, effortlessly cosmopolitan grasp of marginal lifestyles and alternative sexuality is comforting by dint of its occasional clumsiness.
Tech credits belie pic's shoestring resources.

Like the incendiary domestic melodrama of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?  framed in a Pinter-esque narrative mindfuck and spiked with piercing questions of race, class, and gender, John G. Young 's The Reception  is a fresh and uncompromising account of emotional self- immolation and romantic flux. And it has a happy ending to boot.
Essentially a tale of two couples (give or take a gormless suitor and mock spouse or two), The Reception  focuses on Martin (Wayne Lamont Sims ), a nonproducing, psychically numb, gay African American painter who's sequestered himself in the upstate New York  farmhouse of well-off white dipso depressive Jeannette (Pamela Holden Stewart ). He absorbs her drunken abuse in exchange for the companionship and remote digs, and successfully ignores his own unhappiness until Jeannette's estranged daughter, Sierra (Margaret Burkwit ), and her new, also black husband, Andrew (the phenomenally versatile Darien Sills-Evan ), turn up unexpectedly. Like Martin and Jeannette's relationshipto all appearances a comfortable marriage with no more than the average potential for ugly collapseSierra and Andrew's entanglement is not quite what it seems, and the foursome's hidden longings and simmering resentments spew to the surface posthaste.
Young's previous effort, Parallel Sons,  is already a decade old, and it's tempting to believe he spent the intervening years crafting the jarringly complex (but never cheaply illogical) story twists that make this follow-up so lively and demanding. But what really sets The Reception  apartin addition to Derek Wiesehahn 's admirably innovative DV compositions are the risky social themes and bracing tenderness that underlie its plot formalities.
