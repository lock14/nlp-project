I smell penguins, even though Eight Below
's animals are really a pack of sled dogs. This movie's icy Antarctic wilderness also looks somewhat familiar, but Eight Below
 is a different animal entirely from last year's blockbuster documentary March of the Penguins
. Again, however, we have a story about delightfully appealing tundra animals that, despite slight anthropomorphizing by their filmmakers, are certain to charm audiences of all ages with their instinctive natural exploits and distinctive appearances. Eight Below
 is inspired by the blockbuster Japanese film Nankyoku Monogatari
, whose basis was the actual events that occurred during a 1957 Japanese Antarctic expedition. Eight Below
 tells the story of an American scientific outpost, whose human members are ordered to abandon the base when one of those "perfect storms" (that have become a movie clich�) is about to roll in. There is only room on the helicopter for the human beings, so their pack of eight dogs has to be left behind. 2 Fast 2 Furious
' Walker plays Gerry Shepard, the expedition's guide and tender of the dogs, with whom he has a special bond. When conditions prevent a return for the dogs until the next spring, Gerry literally wanders the globe trying to raise funds for a rescue mission. One of his targeted backers is the scientist Davis McClaren (Greenwood), a geologist whose guided trek to find a particular meteorite occupies the first third of the movie. All the expected calamities befall the pair during their trek, and the strength, devotion, and resourcefulness of the dogs is shown to good measure during this eventful portion of the movie. After that, the dogs are on their own for the rest of the film, which at first seems like very awkward pacing as the tribulations of the dogs continue to be crosscut with Gerry's efforts to raise money back home. Gradually, as the speechless interludes of the dogs' nearly six-month-long struggle for survival continue, we come to realize that this is really a movie about the dogs rather than the humans who love them. The all-dog sequences are marvelous, so expressively are they shot (by Cast Away
 and Polar Express
 DP Don Burgess) amid the amazingly desolate and deathly environment. Their segments are really more engaging than the segments of human drama. Walker and Greenwood turn in acceptably rugged yet tender performances, while Biggs proves a delight as the film's comic relief. Bloodgood's fresh face, however, doesn't make up for her thoroughly meaningless role as the story's love interest, Katie. (Gerry, who calls his favorite dog Maya "my best gal," can be seen in a three-way tongue kiss with both his gals in one of the film's final images.) This is Marshall's first directing job since 1995's Congo
, and Eight Below
 returns him to much the same territory as his 1993 film Alive
. A top Hollywood producer with credits such as Raiders of the Lost Ark
, Seabiscuit
, and The Bourne Supremacy
 to his name, Marshall's sideline gig of directing action pictures in far-flung locales is something for which he has an obvious feel. With Eight Below
 he has created a family film that doesn't pander, preach, or poop out. That alone is a rare thing.


The 16 or so huskies playing the eight sled dogs in Disney's umpteenth animal adventure, "Eight Below," do Oscar-caliber acting. They race, heel, attack, lick, and fall over. And at least one has a mean death scene. At nearly every turn, I swear I knew what they were thinking and how they were feeling.
Their hunger was my hunger. Their frozen snouts made mine seem cold. I don't think I could tell Maya apart from Jack, Shorty, Buck, Shadow, Max, Dewey, or Truman if my life depended on it. But after seeing them work their tails off in this fuzzy, mushy, chilly, slobbery heart-warmer, I'd trust them with my life -- were I an injured scientist stuck in the Antarctic as a terrible winter storm approaches, of course.
That's the fate awaiting Dr. Davis McClaren (Bruce Greenwood), a geologist who's come to Antarctica in pursuit of a meteorite for a top-secret research purposes. Jerry Shepard (Paul Walker), his survival guide, tells him it's a dangerous mission (the ice is too thin) but takes him and the dogs anyway. Poor Jack, the oldest of Jerry's octet, was just about to retire, too, which makes him the Danny Glover in "Lethal Weapon" of the group.
The doctor finds what he's looking for, but after falling in a lake he comes down with hypothermia and, along with Jerry, whose hands are frostbitten, has to be flown out of their base to a hospital. This happens just as "two massive low-pressure systems" hit. The entire five-person base crew must evacuate, and there's no room in the airlift for the dogs! They're marooned, and Jerry is beside himself with guilt and anger. Or as beside himself as Paul Walker, in all his hunkiness, can demonstrate. His vast blue eyes, though, have never seemed so lonesome.
Jerry is determined to find a way back to the end of the Earth to save his dogs or, at the very least, pay his respects. Despite the fact that "Eight Below" is based, in part, on a more grueling 1983 Japanese movie called "Antarctica," its being a Disney movie fills you with hope that this will all work out: that Jerry will convince someone to fund a trip back, that the dogs will keep finding ways to fend for themselves (mmm, 
dead killer whale). But for most of the film, possibilities for a reunion don't look good. The movie counts the time the dogs survive on their own. Four days turn into 15, which swell into more upsetting numbers.
Veteran Hollywood producer Frank Marshall directed "Eight Below," which is actually like a family-friendly version of "Alive," Marshall's 1993 film about rugby players who find some unsavory survival techniques after their plane crashes in the Andes. But no matter how slim the pickings get for our sled dogs, they don't turn each other into supper. The dogs are more resourceful than that. My favorite example is when they steal the lunch of a vicious sea lion.
Jerry, meanwhile, pleads his case across America hoping against hope that he can make it back to Antarctica. And gradually "Eight Below" turns into more than a mere cornball family picture.
It's the most touching love story about tragically separated sexy beasts since "Cold Mountain."
.

         The word "mush" leaps to mind in more ways than one while watching Disney's "Eight Below."
 
  This family adventure about a team of sled dogs abandoned in Antarctica naturally invokes the traditional shout of "Mush!" urging the canines to go faster, but it's also an apt descriptor of both its shameless sentimentality and ineptly structured story.
 


         






    We know we're squarely in the land of manipulation from the first strains of Mark Isham's emotive score as we're introduced to the staff of a research mission on the icy continent at the bottom of the globe. The nominal star of the film, Paul Walker, plays Jerry, a guide and sled driver who is seriously devoted to his dogs. He's offset by Jason Biggs' Coop, the comic relief and team cartographer. Gerard Plunkett and Belinda Metz, as scientists, round out the staff.
 
  Jerry's on-again, off-again girlfriend, Katie (Moon Bloodgood), is the pilot who transports supplies and passengers in and out of the remote location. Her latest trek brings scientist Davis McLaren (Bruce Greenwood), who is intent on finding a meteorite from Mercury he believes landed in the area.
 
  Though it's late in the season, with winter bearing down, Jerry and McLaren head off with the sled dogs in search of a rock from the meteor. A nasty storm forces them to return early, and the sequence is by far the film's most thrilling and the only part really worthy of the adventure label. Unfortunately, the action occurs roughly 30 to 45 minutes into the film, leaving some tough sledding for the audience.
 
  After the researchers hurriedly pull up stakes, leaving the dogs to fend for themselves, for the next 45 minutes or so we're subjected to cutting back and forth between Jerry, racked by guilt, moping around the United States and attempting to drum up funding for a rescue, and the dogs fighting for survival in the snow and ice.
 
  The long separation of the canines from their less-interesting human colleagues works against the film's interests, resulting in a dramatically soft framework. While the dogs' battle is certainly worthy, all the switching back and forth undercuts any buildup of tension.
 
  Written by David DiGililo and "suggested" by the 1983 Japanese film "Nankyoku Monogatari," the film also suffers from a largely anticlimactic ending that seems to forget the audience has already been given the information that is supposed to swell our tear ducts. The dogs are nice to look at, and director Frank Marshall, whose producing credits ("Raiders of the Lost Ark," "The Color Purple" and "The Sixth Sense") far outstrip the films he has directed ("Alive," "Arachnophobia" and "Congo"), finds beauty in the snowy vistas, but the film itself is like eating cold porridge.
 
 'Eight Below'
 
 MPAA rating:
 PG for some peril and brief mild language   

We're just moments into the majestic Antarctic snow whiteness of Eight Below  when a cute little penguin flaps and shimmies out of the water through a crack in the ice, shuffling off as if in search of the open bar at a black-tie event. Sorry, buddy, wrong picture! Despite the early cameo appearance of a flightless waddler as a subliminal link to the success of March of the Penguins , Disney's spirit-affirming family affair about the resourcefulness of God's creatures leaves the birds to their baroque reproductive choreography and casts its bid for audience love with an adventure drama about doggies.
There are eight of them, you see  below (as in the bottom of the world), as well as working under subzero conditions  and the canine octet spend their days harnessed to sleds, transporting scientists around otherwise unnavigable territory. Their nights, meanwhile, are drowsed away at a base station watching survival guide Jerry (Paul Walker) flirt chastely with bush pilot Katie (former Laker Girl Moon Bloodgood) and pal around manfully with goofball cartographer Cooper (Jason Biggs). The arrival of an ambitious geologist (always pleasurable Bruce Greenwood) who won't let bad weather slow down his research puts the canine team through their paces: Naturally, the brash human ignores warnings against venturing beyond safe terrain, and naturally, the doggies save him from what might have been a deadly accident, tempering his vanity with their four-legged goodness.
But not until dire weather sets in and the entire nattering population of B actors, with their B-human story lines, is evacuated by airlift while the dogs are forced to stay behind does Eight Below  get to work. And then this clean, classical, hooray-for-the-pooches picture, directed by veteran Frank Marshall for what seems like the pure geographic fun of it, does the thing that Disney animals-in-the-snow movies have been doing so reliably  and satisfyingly  since White Wilderness  nearly 50 years ago: It tells a wordless, admirable tale of quadruped bravery, cooperation, loyalty, patience, and nobility, with crisp nature photography and fine, round music.
Based on a Japanese Antarctic film and inspired by a real-life story of sled dogs who survived extended subzero abandonment, Eight Below  teeters at times too coyly on the frozen territory of anthropomorphism  the handsome, personable dogs who find a way to survive until the humans return aren't just impressive animals (and terrific movie stars, at that), they're also designated as ''heroes'' who enact psychological dramas of their own in David DiGilio's ingratiating script.
But happily, Marshall and his superb cinematographer, Don Burgess (Spider-Man ), attend to the big picture, letting nature speak for herself beyond the reach of staged conflicts. There's something invigorating about this unpretentious dog tale. And if a penguin drops by to promote his own movie product, well, there's room on the frozen continent for all.

 "Eight Below" stars Paul Walker as Jerry Shepard, a rugged yet soulful Antarctic guide, and Bruce Greenwood as Davis, the ambitious geologist he leads on a quest to recover a fallen chunk of Mercury. Jason Biggs co-stars as a kooky cartographer, and Moon Bloodgood plays a pilot. Completing the ensemble are Maya, Max, Shadow, Buck, Dewey, Truman, Shorty and Old Jack, eight wildly talented, inhumanly adorable huskies who live only to please their masters   — both the ones on screen and the ones buying tickets for this megadose of Disney schmaltz. Can you guess who gives the credible performance here?  Cat people are directed to, well, any other movie at all. "Eight Below" is Grade A pooch porn, an orgy of canine cuteness. Based on a true story, not that it matters, the movie putters around for an hour in search of that pesky rock, with the inevitable misadventures, animal heroics and imminent arrival of "the biggest storm in  25 years!" Everything else goes to the dogs. Abandoned by the fleeing humans, they are instantly anthropomorphized and leap into the blinding white landscape to scavenge for food, tangle with sea lions and practice their sentimental reaction shots.  Meanwhile, Jerry knocks on doors from Capitol Hill to Pasadena in an attempt to drum up funds for a rescue trip. Come on, people, there are dogs to be saved 9,000 miles away in the middle of apocalyptic weather! Super-cute dogs! But no. At home  in oceanfront Oregon, where he lives in manly splendor and solitude, Jerry gazes at snapshots of his furry friends. Will no one come to the rescue? Of course they will. And will they make it in time? Dog nerds with kids   can find out for themselves.  "Eight Below" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Doggy deaths may upset the littlest ones, but even grown-ups will be startled by the attack of the computer-generated leopard seal.

The family adventure "Eight Below" is an easy watch, thanks to the splendors of frosty scenery and furry canines. Pic, which follows eight sled dogs trapped in Antarctica and the humans who try to rescue them, is an entertaining story (but less so when bipeds are taking up valuable four-legged screentime). The Disney offering should do reasonable winter biz, with better to come as a home-format item.
Pic is "suggested" by the 1983 Nippon feature "Nankyoku Monogatari" (Antarctica), which was in turn inspired by real-life events. The Japanese version was set in 1958, with two human protags, and seven out of nine dogs doomed early on. This version is set in the early '90s, with a single principal human and a much happier ending for man's best friends.
The film, shot in Canada, Norway and Greenland, marks prolific producer Frank Marshall's first bigscreen directorial effort since "Congo" (1995); Marshall and his team do a good job suggesting both the majesty and fearsomeness of the Antarctica landscape.
And while huskies may not be the most facially expressive of dogs, they certainly are among the most handsome; as long as the movie concentrates on the octet's against-the-odds survival, the film is thoroughly engaging.
Jerry (Paul Walker) is a resident guide at the U.S. National Science Research Base in Antarctica. His comic sidekick is cartographer Charlie Cooper (Jason Biggs), and there are still some embers burning in his officially cooled relationship with the site's pilot supplier Katie (Moon Bloodgood).
One day she flies in an ambitious Yank academic, Davis McClaren (Bruce Greenwood), who hopes to be the first to find fragments of meteorites from the planet Mercury. Trouble is, winter is approaching, and the location he's determined to explore is a risky distance away.
Jerry reluctantly harnesses up his beloved team of eight sled dogs -- six Siberian huskies and two "all brawn, no brain" Malamutes -- and does as the cocky prof bids. Their mission is a success, despite one particularly scary moment, but during their return a massive storm descends.
Men and dogs barely make it back through the blizzard, and, when they reach the base, they discover everyone must be evacuated by air immediately. There's no room on-board for the hounds, but Katie promises Jerry she'll fly back to get them as soon as the humans are dropped off in New Zealand.
Unfortunately, weather conditions prevent that from happening. With winter's premature start, the dogs -- chained together so they won't run away -- are stranded for the season, almost certain to die of exposure and hunger.
With no way of knowing their fate, Jerry roams the globe trying to drum up funds for an emergency rescue operation. Meanwhile, the dogs have broken free of their constraints and learn to survive by themselves.
Periodic titles report how long they've been left alone, with more than six months passing before help finally arrives.
The film's full two hours can be felt in the scenes dealing with human characters, who get way too much screentime in pic's long midsection.
Walker's Jerry is a bit bland and Jerry's feelings for the dogs in his charge -- or for Katie, for that matter -- never feel like more than a necessary script conceit. Other cast members make competent but undistinguished contribs, excepting Biggs' likeable turn.
The few post-prod f/x (a "Jurassic Park"-looking vicious leopard seal, an aurora borealis lightshow) tend to stick out like sore thumbs. Otherwise, all tech aspects are high-grade; Mark Isham's atypically conventional, rousing orchestral score is a significant plus.

At the base of Japan 's Tokyo Tower , a pack of dogs prowls in perpetuitystatues erected to commemorate 13 sled dogs left behind in Antarctica  by a Japanese research expedition in 1958. A subsequent expedition returned almost a year later to find that two dogs had survived. Their story inspired the 1983 film Nankyoku Monogatari , here Disneyed with a winterized Paul Walker , fresh from plumbing the depths of camp and the ocean in last summer's Into the Blue . Sidekick Jason Biggs still best known for lustily penetrating a tinful of freshly baked Americanathankfully leaves the innocence of all welcoming Antarctic snowbanks intact. Alas, it's too wide a credibility crevasse for the audience to leap: from pie-poker to subzero cartographer. Despite this minor deficiency, a gorgeous art film full of snowy silences and spare, gestural performances threatens to break loose (the most inspired acting comes courtesy of the canines), though the plot's slavish schmaltz proves as oppressive as the harsh winter that descends upon the dogs. At least it's comforting to know that dogs, left to their own devices in a barren land, get stoned and trip out on the aurora borealis, just like their masters might.
