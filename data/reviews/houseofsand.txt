         In 1910, the lunatic Vasco de Sá (Ruy Guerra) leads his young, pregnant wife, Áurea (Fernanda Torres), her mother, Doña Maria (Fernanda Montenegro), and a band of men and donkeys into the sandy wasteland of the Maranhão desert in northern Brazil — which he has somehow convinced himself is prosperous land. Áurea begs Vasco to return to the city, but he refuses and begins instead to build a house in the dunes. His men quickly abandon him, and Vasco dies soon afterward, leaving Áurea and her mother stranded on the lunar landscape alone.
 
  Brazilian director Andrucha Waddington's exquisitely beautiful film slowly unfolds over three generations, spanning nearly a century during which the world is completely transformed, though Áurea and Doña Maria never know it. Forced to remain in the house after an early attempt to leave proves too difficult to attempt alone, the women survive thanks to Massu (Seu Jorge), a descendant of runaway slaves who formed a small colony nearby. Like the women, the colony remains trapped in time; some even refuse to believe that slavery has long been abolished. Slowly, Doña Maria, Áurea and Massu form a tacit, nearly wordless bond and a fashion a home surreally appointed with the rapidly fading trappings of bourgeois city life.
 


         






    As visually lush as it is existentially Beckettian, "House of Sand" is essentially a story of things not happening, and Áurea is a study in what happens to even a protean human will when it's chastened by larger forces. For years, Áurea endeavors to find a way out, initially pinning her hopes on a salt trader, Chico (Emiliano Queiroz), the only man to come and go freely from the remote location. Doña Maria refuses to let her go while pregnant, however, and as the women wait for little Maria (Camilla Facundes) to be old enough to travel, their only hope eventually disappears. Doña Maria gradually adapts to her surroundings, but Áurea clings to her goal. By the time she comes across a group of scientists who have come to the desert to photograph stars during the solar eclipse, and their guide, Luiz (Enrique Diaz), promises to help her, she's been marooned in a time capsule for almost a decade.
 
  Introducing news of the outside world in fleeting, decade-long intervals and relying mostly on imagery to tell the story, screenwriter Elena Soárez weaves a lyrical narrative about isolation and time that recalls great space allegories such as "2001: A Space Odyssey" and "The Little Prince." Real-life mother and daughter Montenegro and Torres play Doña Maria, Áurea and Áurea's daughter, Maria, at different stages of their lives, lending the movie a curious continuum that's echoed in time and space-bending theme. When Luiz tries to explain to Áurea the nature of the scientists' work, which will prove Einstein's theory of relativity, he tells her that if one twin traveled to space and the other remained on Earth, the space-traveling twin would return home younger than his brother. Many years later, Maria escapes the dunes. She returns to Maranhão for the first time in the late '60s, as an older woman (played by Montenegro), with the news that a man has walked on the moon. The elderly Áurea naturally assumes that Luiz's story has come true.
 
  Torres gives a touching, remarkable performance as a passionate and willful young woman lost in space and cut off from time, and as Doña Maria and the older Áurea, Montenegro gives wonderful portrayals of the aftermath of their choice to adapt and survive when it becomes clear to her that the world has passed them by. Heartbreaking and strange, "House of Sand" is as original as it is lovely.

As the camera offers a God's-eye view of layered white sand, you realize that you're in for two hours of desert-as-allegory. It's 1910, and Áurea (Fernanda Torres), along with her mother (Fernanda Montenegro), has been dragged to the oblivion of northern Brazil by her crazy husband. The women are stranded  for years that stretch into decades. The House of Sand 's director, Andrucha Waddington, lays on the Awesome Visual Poetry and throws in a welter of story gimmicks (the actresses leap roles as they age), but it's all a bit too fancifully arid.

 If anything, the title of “House of Sand” is an understatement. This lovely film, directed by Andrucha Waddington (“Me You Them”), takes place in a corner of northern Brazil that is a veritable universe of dry, swirling white dust. Like the main characters — three women of successive generations exiled from a softer, more accommodating life in the city —  you grow accustomed to this landscape after a while, and come to appreciate its beauty. But at first it seems about as hospitable as the surface of Mars:   gritty, windy, almost actively hostile to human habitation.  Mr. Waddington and his director of photography, Ricardo Della Rosa, use a wide-screen format and long, angled shots to capture the harsh sublimity of this desert, where the sand is relieved by strips of vegetation and an occasional glimpse of the nearby ocean. The land is such a presence in the film that it almost takes on the status of a character. It’s not just the setting for the struggles of the women, but an active agent in their destinies and the object of their loathing, their terror and, ultimately, their love.  Filmed near the Lençóis Maranhenses National Park, “House of Sand” is not without its share of human grandeur, since it stars Fernanda Montenegro and Fernanda Torres, a mother and a daughter who happen to be among the national treasures of Brazilian cinema. They undertake not just two performances, but a suite, the harmonies and counterpoints of which are both subtle and breathtaking.  At the beginning  Ms. Montenegro is Dona Maria, a weary matriarch accompanying her pregnant daughter, Áurea (Ms. Torres), on a trek into the middle of nowhere. The year is 1910, and Áurea is following her monomaniacal husband, who holds the deed on a few acres of howling nothingness.    Before long, Áurea’s husband’s fellow travelers have departed, and he himself has restored the phrase “bitten the dust” to its literal meaning. For help the women turn to their only neighbors, descendants of runaway slaves who populate a leafy fishing village. One of them, Massu (Seu Jorge), occupies a role in Maria and Áurea’s household somewhere between servant and husband.  As the years pass —  the full span of the narrative stretches 60 years —  the human relationships rise to the surface, in particular the almost wordless, emotionally complicated bond between Áurea and Massu. At different points in the story, the actresses change roles, with Ms. Montenegro settling into her daughter’s outgrown characters. She appears as Áurea in a chapter that takes place in the 1940’s, during which Ms. Torres plays a second Maria, Áurea’s daughter, who has grown up wild and angry, resentful of her mother and remote from the customs and traditions that helped Áurea and the first Maria to endure.  The story that links these moments has the clarity of a fable and the sentimental enchantment of a magic-realist novel. Mr. Waddington, who brilliantly evoked the dry, brown Brazilian backlands in “Me You Them,” brings out the psychological nuances of the story (the script is by Elena Soárez) even as he respects its bold, primal emotions and the almost classical dignity of the main characters. At first “House of Sand” may seem like a stark tale of survival, but a surprisingly lush and colorful romance blossoms in its bleak and gorgeous desert setting.  “House of Sand” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has several sex scenes.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

The physical, emotional and cosmic unite in Andrucha Waddington's powerful "The House of Sand." Marking a quantum leap for the talented helmer and busy producer ("Me, You. Them"), pic magnificently renders a fresh view of life on planet Earth. A saga set in remote sand dunes over a 59-year stretch with a handful of characters may sound like a severe test for auds, but the film's masterful pace, structure and dramatic payoff has already earned handsome B.O. dividends in Brazil since its May opening, and will score intense distrib and fest interest around the world. 
Because it involves three generations of mothers and daughters surviving in the remote landscape of Maranhao in northern Brazil from 1910 to 1969, unsuspecting viewers may assume Elena Soarez's screenplay (which nabbed the Sundance/NHK prize in 2002 for yet-to-be shot script) is based on historical events. In fact, inspiration derives solely from a photo of a small hut built in the sand dunes of Maranhao, out of which Soarez (along with Waddington and producer Luiz Carlos Barreto) constructed an unlikely and surprisingly complex adventure.
Waddington and cinematographer Ricardo Della Rosa expressively lens and frame a caravan of evidently urban emigres trudging through a sandstorm toward their supposed new home. Opening moving shots over the otherworldly Maranhao landscape establish an awe-inspiring mood, projecting a sense of civilized people lost in an alien place. Vasco de Sa (played memorably if briefly by director Ruy Guerra) has dragged his young pregnant wife Aurea (Fernanda Torres), her mother Dona Maria (Fernanda Montenegro) and others into this hellhole to establish a new home on land he has bought. Immediately confronted by local blacks, including Massu (Luiz Melodia), who appear on a dune horizon, Vasco must trade some valuables to stake his ground. But Vasco soon dies in an accident, leaving mother and daughter to fend for themselves.
The juxtaposition of properly raised women in black Victorian garb hiking through hostile landscapes toward the surprise sight of ocean and coastline only begins the next bend of the tale, where the pair create, with Massu's help, a new, fragile home on a coastal outcropping.
At every stage of the story, Waddington pays close attention to such micro details as the small flows of sand constantly invading the house and macro observations of the greater landscape, balanced with the sometimes wordless emotional links and conflicts. Aurea regularly tries to find her way back to civilization; Dona Maria learns to accept her fate, and make the most of what she has.
But, in roles specifically fashioned for them, both real-life mother and daughter actors show such steeliness and fortitude that there's never any doubt each character will survive.
By 1919, the poor homestead is firmly settled, but problems crop up with salt seller Chico (Emiliano Queiroz). Aurea still wants to get away with young daughter Maria (Camilla Facundes) and give the land to Massu. 
En route to her hoped-for escape, Aurea experiences a lunar eclipse, then encounters an encampment of astronomers hears news of the wider world and falls in love with camp guard Luiz (Enrique Diaz). But when Aurea returns home for the final farewell, she finds the house nearly destroyed and her mother dead.
As an adult, in 1942, Maria (now Torres) is a good-for-nothing floozy who indulges in rampant sex and booze. Aurea (now Montenegro) is beside herself with anger at her daughter, but can do nothing to control her. The sudden appearance of a dead WWII pilot triggers the return of Luiz, now a Brazilian air force officer who does a double-take at the sight of Maria, recalling his old love. She plays on his vulnerability and makes love to him, while Massu (now Luiz Melodia) is briefly overcome with jealousy at seeing the officer.
Luiz, though, is Maria's way out, and final irony is that the mother who always wanted to leave the dunes sees her daughter flee. In 1969, Maria (now Montenegro) returns to see her mom still getting by, informing her that a man landed on the moon and playing her some Chopin piano on a tape cassette. Such simple details are the stuff of an astounding emotional denouement that wraps up and connects all of the film's key themes from the personal to the cosmic.
Cast is in tour-de-force mode, with Montenegro and Torres a combustible combination, easily shifting through the generations. Effective underplaying is the guiding principle to all perfs. 
Fearsome physical onditions are made palpable with d.p. Della Rosa's ability to so well capture the film's many atmospheric moods. Kudos as well should go to production designer Tule Peake's realistic palm-covered house, costume designer Claudia Kopke's marvelous sense of period specificity, and a sound package that becomes an essential part of making "The House of Sand" a work of total cinema.
