People mourn in different ways. Some lock their hearts in a box and nurse their grief in private; others head to the nearest public square to rend their garments. So, too, with 9/11 movies: Some, like this spring's ``United 93," distrust the urge to mythify and replay the tragedy with blunt fidelity. Others seek comfort in commemoration, looking for stray moments of indomitability and building emotional statuary to the fallen.
``World Trade Center" builds a memorial to the risen, actually -- two New York Port Authority cops who survived being buried for nearly 24 hours under the rubble of Tower Two. If that seems unduly rosy in the face of the 2,759 people who didn't make it, the movie has the grace to suggest we need those few who return carrying the tale. Honoring them only sharpens our grief for the others.
Oliver Stone has made an honorable film, in other words, and almost the best thing I can say about it is that it doesn't feel like an Oliver Stone movie. There are no conspiracies here, no pointing of fingers beyond a slow-rising anger at the perpetrators. ``World Trade Center" is big and it's sentimental, and it thankfully resists the urge to fetishize the images that have been horribly familiar for nearly five years now. The film rarely goes wide to take in the larger picture; it sees the cataclysm quite literally from ground zero. In so doing it puts human faces on the hundreds of rescue workers who perished, paying tribute to both their averageness and their astounding resolve.
Well, all right, one of those faces belongs to Nicolas Cage, movie star. As if shying from the spotlight, though, the actor plays Sergeant John McLoughlin with minimal show. Cage is rail-thin here, hiding behind a mustache, a uniform, and the sort of competence that doesn't have to assert itself. When first word of the disaster comes to the Port Authority midtown command post, McLoughlin simply saddles up and asks for volunteers to come with him, and his worth can be gauged by the disappointment of those who aren't chosen.
Four PA cops head downtown with him, and the magnitude of what's going on grows with every block. Yet the officers are too busy parsing rumor and responding to immediate problems to step back. ``World Trade Center" relegates9/11 iconography to the background: The ash-covered businessmen and bloodied office workers are glimpsed fleetingly, and the film never stops to identify the source of the periodic crashing noises that startle the police and firemen. (After a while we understand they're the sound made by falling human bodies.) Stone and writer Andrea Berloff turn the movie into a testament to professionalism, and only then do they wonder where professionalism ends and panic begins.
With the collapse of Tower Two, ``World Trade Center" becomes a survival film, the sort of true-life saga that might make a decent TV movie if the surrounding event weren't burned into our collective psyche. The men of McLoughlin's team are pinned under concrete blocks that shift with dreadful, impersonal unpredictability. One of the cops does something that looks like suicide; whether Stone muffs the scene or he's protecting the man's memory isn't clear.
Finally it comes down to a handful of officers immobilized in darkness, choking out banalities to keep each other alive. McLoughlin and the others are free from the neck up; it's as if they'd gone to work and found themselves in a Beckett play. In this hell, the audience and the other men come to rely on Officer Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), whose spirit seems uncrushable; Pena, one of the faces in the crowd of last year's ``Crash," gives a performance for which year-end awards seem petty.
Above ground, Stone now switches his focus to the families. Maria Bello as Donna McLoughlin and Maggie Gyllenhaal as Jimeno's pregnant wife, Allison, play their parts with weary grit and distress signals only we and their children can see. What sentimentality the movie doles out is reserved for the flashbacks the men use to keep themselves from faltering. Perhaps two scenes featuring a glowing Jesus is one too many, but if that's what helped the real Will Jimeno stay alive, then we're almost beyond criticism here. (Anyway, Stone has always been a director who scoffs at the notion of restraint; that's his strength and his big old Achilles ' heel.)
The movie also spotlights those who plunged into the wreckage to find the fallen officers: Emergency Service Unit officer Scott Strauss (an unrecognizable Stephen Dorff), and paramedic Chuck Sereika (Frank Whaley, making his character a touchingly uncertain man who rises to the occasion). The most startling character is Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), a devout accountant and ex-Marine who the moment he saw the news reports walked out of his office , put on his military uniform, and proceeded to ground zero to do what he could. In the scarily intense Karnes we see a righteous thirst for vengeance co exist with a tenderness almost beyond measure; Stone reminds the viewer of how the destruction of the towers fused hot, contradictory emotions in us all.
``World Trade Center" proudly samples patriotism among its other core emotions; to do otherwise would be to play the day false. If you want a 9/11 drama that engages the political underpinnings of the event -- what led up to the attacks, what ensued -- you should find another movie.
Call this playing it safe or focusing on the things that matter, the result is that Stone has made a less rigorous, more comforting film than Paul Greengrass's monumental ``United 93." ``World Trade Center" barely references terrorism and acknowledges the rest of the world only through shots of horror-struck crowds in foreign countries (it's as though they're watching the latest, most realistic Hollywood blockbuster). Stone and Berloff stick to the day's damage and resilience, and their faith in the innate goodness of average Americans is as genuinely touching as it is soothing.
And if part of your brain wonders why we can't process a catastrophe like this until it has been turned into a Hollywood movie, or why we sift an unimaginably horrific day for the few pinpoints of good news, feel free to follow such thoughts wherever they may lead you. One reason ``World Trade Center" is such a good, healing cry is that it absolves us of the discomfort of thinking about everything that has happened since.


Five years later, the rawness of the horror of Sept. 11, 2001, has never gone away. Thinking back to that day, our memories still swirl around media images of frenzy, of the chaos of destruction: the planes crashing, with nightmare force, into the World Trade Center; the sickening, ash-spew implosion of the twin towers; the people in the street scurrying through clogs of smoke and debris, their heads turned back as they flee the madness. Early on, Oliver Stone's World Trade Center  conjures some of that nearly unabsorbable terror and shock (a body falls from one tower), and it adds a dread-soaked image that most of us have probably imagined but never seen, even as a reenactment. In the concourse between the North and South Towers, a crew of policemen stand, frozen, as the South Tower begins to collapse. They have no idea what's happening, but it seems like the end of the world, as what looks like a black tornado shoots in from the windows and they run for the cover of the elevator shaft and then...nothing.
Moments later, John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage), the Port Authority police sergeant who is leading the crew of first responders, and Will Jimeno (Michael Peña), one of his men, wake up in the darkness, their bodies pinned by slabs of concrete and skewers of twisted metal. They will be, before long, the only two of their team left alive, and as they call out to one another, what strikes us, more than anything, is the gloomy static silence of the place they're in. Their limbs are trapped, maybe crushed, their bodies lacerated with pain, and Stone allows their bloody, soot-caked faces, lying horizontal, to fill most of the frame  a realistic, at times nearly poetic image of survival wrestling with impotence. It's as if they've passed into some shadow world, a vast crushed-wire tomb, with a solitary shaft of heavenly light  a ray of hope  shining down through the rubble above.
Having set us in this dank, claustrophobic, industrial purgatory, the movie returns to the outside world, picking up the trauma of the officers' wives and families. Donna McLoughlin, played by a forceful Maria Bello, hides her fear behind a wall of fury; the pregnant Allison Jimeno, played by a gentle Maggie Gyllenhaal, masters hers by fretting over her baby's name. The tone is personal and mournful; there is no mention of al-Qaeda, little reference to the surrounding spirit of national cataclysm. As Stone then returns, again and again, to that space beneath the rubble, he overwhelms us with the anxiety and eerie tranquility of death.
As a tribute to those who died, and survived, on Sept. 11, World Trade Center  is a scrupulous and honorable film. Yet it never comes close to being a revelatory one; it sentimentalizes more than it haunts. At one point, Stone includes a spectacular digitized image of the World Trade Center in flames, viewed from a dramatic low angle  an unsettling shot because the pixelized smoke and debris are far less immediate, less disturbing, than the genuine, horrible video footage. That digitally created image made 9/11, to me, feel at once close and far away, and World Trade Center  has the same effect: You're always aware you're watching a dramatization, with not-quite-desolate-enough sets of Ground Zero and actors transmuting the terror of experience into desperate nobility.
You could argue, of course, that director Paul Greengrass did a similar thing in United 93 , but to me that movie's brilliance was the way it undermined your defenses by restaging 9/11 with the electric realism of live media. To know what occurred, or might have occurred, on that plane, and to see it as if it was happening before your eyes, fed a need that was at once journalistic, patriotic, and wildly cinematic. It was exactly the sort of film you might have expected Oliver Stone to make, but World Trade Center  isn't a great Stone film; it's more like a decent Ron Howard film.
As McLoughlin and Jimeno lie there, praying to be rescued, they speak about their kids, their bodily agony, at one point even taking inspiration from G.I. Jane , and the two actors find a quiet, touching connection. Yet it does no disservice to the suffering, and courage, of John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno to say that there's a fundamental lack of dramatic urgency to World Trade Center . The harrowing, at times unbearable grip of United 93  was part of its human tumult. Stone, who at his greatest is the most harrowing of filmmakers, now recedes into the conventionality of uplift. I felt as if he was atoning  for provocative remarks he made after 9/11, for the debacle of Alexander , for too much time in the Hollywood wilderness. He earns his penance, but at the expense of his art.

 How will Hollywood respond? This question began to surface not long after the Sept. 11 attacks — shockingly soon after, if memory serves.  It was impossible to banish the thought, even in the midst of that day’s horror and confusion, that the attacks themselves represented a movie scenario made grotesquely literal. What other frame of reference did we have for burning skyscrapers and commandeered airplanes? And then our eyes and minds were so quickly saturated with the actual, endlessly replayed images — the second plane’s impact; the plumes of smoke coming from the tops of the twin towers; the panicked citizens covered in ash — that the very notion of a cinematic reconstruction seemed worse than redundant. Nobody needed to be told that this was not a movie. And at the same time nobody could doubt that, someday, it would be.  And now, as the fifth anniversary approaches, it is. For a while a lot of movies seemed to deal with 9/11 obliquely or allegorically. But Paul Greengrass’s “United 93” and Oliver Stone’s “World Trade Center,” rather than digging for meanings and metaphors, represent a return to the literal.  Both films revisit the immediate experience of Sept. 11, staking out a narrow perspective and filling it with maximum detail. Mr. Stone, much of whose film takes place at ground zero, does not share Mr. Greengrass’s clinical, quasi-documentary aesthetic. His sensibility is one of visual grandeur, sweeping emotion and heightened, sometimes overwrought, drama.  There are many words a critic might use to describe Mr. Stone’s films — maddening, brilliant, irresponsible, provocative, long — but subtle is unlikely to be on the list. Which makes him the right man for the job, since there was nothing subtle about the emotions of 9/11. Later  there would be complications, nuances, gray areas, as the event and its aftermath were inevitably pulled into the murky, angry swirl of American politics. But that is territory Mr. Stone, somewhat uncharacteristically, avoids.  “World Trade Center” is only the second film, after “U Turn,”  that he has directed entirely from someone else’s script, and Andrea Berloff’s screenplay, her first to be produced, imposes a salutary discipline on some of the director’s wilder impulses. The unruly intellectual ambitions that animate both Mr. Stone’s most vigorous work — “Platoon,” “Wall Street,” “J.F.K.” — and his woolliest — “Alexander,” “Natural Born Killers” — may be held in check here, but the sober carefulness of this project nonetheless highlights some of his strengths as a filmmaker.  There is really no other American director who can move so swiftly and emphatically from intimate to epic scale, saturating even quiet moments with fierce emotion. He edits like a maestro conducting Beethoven, coaxing images and sequences into a state of agitated eloquence.  Ms. Berloff’s script is composed in the key of strong, simple feeling, and brought to life with vivid clarity by Seamus McGarvey’s cinematography. “World Trade Center” is, from the first frame to last, almost unbearably moving. It could hardly be otherwise, given the facts of the story and the memories it will stir up.  The movie concentrates on two Port Authority police officers, John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno, who were trapped deep in the rubble of the collapsed towers, where they had gone to help with the evacuation  after the first plane hit. Starting before dawn on Sept. 11 and covering roughly the next 24 hours, the narrative switches back and forth from the men to their families, in particular the wives, who spend agonized hours waiting for news of their husbands’ fates.    Sergeant McLoughlin, played by Nicolas Cage, has a quiet, watchful air. A veteran of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, he rushes into the breach on 9/11 knowing that no adequate plan exists to deal with a catastrophe of this magnitude. Jimeno (Michael Peña), a rookie, is eager and a little anxious; his face registers his desire to prove himself on the job and also distinct shadings of fear — both the worry that he’ll mess up and, as the hours go by, a much deeper terror.  Pinned  under tons of smashed masonry and twisted metal, they keep talking to each other to keep despair and sleep at bay, and you get the sense that it’s their first real conversation, an exchange of commonplaces in the face of death. McLoughlin and his wife, Donna (Maria Bello), have four children; Jimeno and his wife, Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal),  are expecting their second, and as the two men talk, the banalities of domestic life take on an almost sacred cast.  In an Oliver Stone film actors are well advised to bring their own nuances, and the delicacy and insight of the performances in “World Trade Center” complement the director’s bold brushstrokes. Ms. Bello reveals Donna’s toughness without overstating it, while Ms. Gyllenhaal suggests a complicated, prickly personality underneath the panic and grief.  Mr. Cage turns all his intensity inward, playing a man who can be a little self-conscious about his own reticence. (“People don’t like me because I don’t smile a lot,” he says.) He looks older and more worn than he has in other films, and he wears his character’s tired stoicism like an old shirt.  Mr.  Peña, who played the good-hearted locksmith in “Crash,” is friendlier and jumpier; Jimeno slips naturally into the role of McLoughlin’s talkative kid brother. the temperamental contrast between the two actors keeps the movie going through its long, difficult middle stretch.  Both the officers and their wives spend most of “World Trade Center” in different states of paralysis. The men are physically immobilized, while the women, surrounded by well-meaning friends and family, can neither help their husbands nor learn for sure what has happened to them. And so they sit stricken, by the telephone or in front of the television, as a maelstrom of hectic activity engulfs New York and its environs.  It is this combination of frantic action with stunned, shocked impotence that “World Trade Center” most effectively reproduces. The details are all in place — the office paper falling like snow; the voices of Tom Brokaw and Aaron Brown extemporizing a collective interpretation of something no one could have imagined; the briefly glimpsed faces of George W. Bush and Rudolph W. Giuliani projecting leadership from the television screen — but the point of the movie is not so much to construct a visual replica as to immerse you, once again, in shock, terror, rage and sorrow. And also in the solidarity and concern — the love — that were part of 9/11.  The movie is not only about the victims of the attack and their families, but also about their rescuers, notably David Karnes (Michael Shannon), who leaves his office job in Connecticut, puts on his Marine Corps uniform and slips into ground zero to search for survivors. Karnes is the only character in the film who looks past the smoke and suffering and articulates a desire for revenge.  But Mr. Stone and Ms. Berloff, like Mr. Greengrass, keep their distance from post- — or, for that matter, pre-  — 9/11 politics. The two men buried under the Trade Center don’t even know what brought it down, and everyone else is much too busy to begin learning the exotic vocabulary we would all eventually acquire. This movie has nothing to say about Osama bin Laden, Al Qaeda or jihad. That comes later.  In the Sept. 11 of “World Trade Center,” feeling transcends politics, and the film’s astonishingly faithful re-creation of the emotional reality of the day produces a curious kind of nostalgia. It’s not that anyone would wish to live through such agony again, but rather that the extraordinary upsurge of fellow  feeling that the attacks produced seems  precious. And also very distant from the present. Mr. Stone has taken a public tragedy and turned it into something at once genuinely stirring and terribly sad. His film offers both a harrowing return to a singular, disastrous episode in the recent past and a refuge from the ugly, depressing realities of its aftermath.  “World Trade Center” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has scenes of extreme, upsetting violence, most of which reproduce images that were originally seen on television during daylight hours.

Attempting to convey a macro vision of Sept. 11 through a micro lens, Oliver Stone is to be credited for presenting this challenging, fact-based story with admirable restraint, a quality that has not always characterized his past directorial efforts. Yet these events -- which require no dramatic embellishment -- by their nature result in a claustrophobic film, as two port authority cops lie buried in rubble struggling to survive. As such, "World Trade Center" yields lovely and touching moments but proves a slow-going, arduous movie experience, if more uplifting than Universal's earlier test of that historic day's box office potential, "United 93."
With the upcoming five-year anniversary of the towers' fall as a somewhat arbitrary milestone, Paramount's task to sell another movie steeped in 9/11 lore remains a formidable one. That's largely because those harrowing images were shared initially through the prism of television and have been explored effectively and extensively within that medium, from Jules and Gedeon Naudet's CBS documentary "9/11" -- which most closely mirrors elements here -- to the various dramatizations related to United 93 and other aspects of the story.
Stone's film bears some thematic resemblance to "Alive," Frank Marshall's 1993 chronicle of a plane crash in the Andes. Both offer a tribute to human endurance under unimaginable conditions, but watching young guys huddle together trying not to freeze to death or two cops pinned under tons of debris isn't exactly a cinematic thrill ride.
The first produced screenplay from Andrea Berloff, "World Trade Center" begins with a quiet, powerful sense of foreboding, as the characters go about what will be anything but another mundane Tuesday.
Sergeant John McLoughlin (Nicolas Cage) drives through the early morning twilight to his job at the New York Port Authority, where there's a "Hill Street Blues"-type briefing before chaos erupts over news that a plane has struck the World Trade Center. McLoughlin and a busload of officers, including Will Jimeno (Michael Pena), rush to the scene with scant sense of what's happening.
"There's no plan" for an evacuation of this magnitude, the taciturn McLoughlin says in his rough accent, as he prepares his team to ascend into the building, which creaks ominously. Then, suddenly, the world comes crashing down around them, belching out a huge cloud of dust that leaves McLoughlin and Jimeno trapped dozens of feet below ground, desperately trying to maintain consciousness -- convinced, somehow, that succumbing to pain and exhaustion by falling sleep will mean certain death.
So far, so good, but it's at this point that the movie perhaps inevitably bogs down. Largely eschewing flashbacks (some are used sparingly), Stone alternates between the imperiled cops, McLoughlin's wife Donna (Maria Bello), and Jimeno's very pregnant spouse Allison (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who waits nervously with her extended family for word regarding her husband.
A fourth thread -- and surely the most interesting -- centers on Dave Karnes (Michael Shannon), a spit-and-polish former Marine who, improbably, dons his dress uniform and drives from Connecticut directly to Ground Zero, where he wades through desolation that resembles the nightmare vision of "The Terminator," searching for survivors.
Beyond this core, Stone has populated his film with terrific actors in even minor parts, from the various cops to Viola Davis as a worried mother with a missing son to Donna Murphy as one of Donna's friends. The fact remains, though, that long stretches are shot in tight close-up on John and more personable Will lying immersed in gray muck, seeking to stay alive. While both actors deliver strong performances, they are confined by the narrative figuratively as well as literally, spurring a degree of impatience for the climax.
For Paramount, the saving grace could be that many who venture into the theater will do so with at best cursory knowledge of the story's resolution, unlike the grim certainty of "United 93," which yielded modest returns despite considerable advance coverage and praise. Yet both this and the Universal film ultimately present an inspiring vision of can-do American spirit amid adversity, exemplified by Karnes and the rescue workers (played by, among others, Stephen Dorff and Frank Whaley) risking life and limb to assist complete strangers.
Technically, Stone's production is a work of superior craftsmanship, highlighted by astonishing sound quality, which captures the towers' destruction with a staggering din as the buildings give way. Craig Armstrong also delivers an appropriately sensitive score.
Among the pic's credited producers is Debra Hill, who developed the material before dying of cancer last year.

Oliver Stone 's World Trade Center   lands todayits title as emphatic and its subject as world historical as any movie since Stone weighed in with JFK . The surprising thing about this commission job, directed from Andrea Berloff 's script, is not its factuality but its restraint.
Master of the sledgehammer, Stone spent millions of Paramount  dollars recreating the post9-11 "pile" on a back-lot ground zero. Still, World Trade Center 's most impressive effect is its delicate editing. The epoch-defining disaster is rendered in shorthandthe shadow of a plane, the thud of the impactand largely mediated by TV. For the most part, Stone favors discreet cutaways and meaningful blackouts. He's a good soldier.
So are his protagonists. Twenty years a Port Authority cop, John McLoughlin  (Nicolas Cage ) rises at 3:29 a.m., squeezes past sleeping wife Donna (Maria Bello ), checks their slumbering brood, and heads to work, the car radio providentially blasting "sun comin' up on New York City." As he arrives at the Port Authority Bus Terminal, younger officer Will Jimeno  (Michael Peña )soon his buddy in horrorthreads through the heedless crowd of Ratso Rizzos  and Travis Bickles . Their daily briefing has a military quality; when news arrives that a plane has struck the WTC, John and company head for the war zone. It's their duty: "We're going downtown."
The ghastly doomsday vision is slightly sweetened with CGI. Only one person is glimpsed leaping from 90 stories up. In the most startling image, John and Willwho have volunteered to evacuate trapped office workerswatch the collapse of the second tower from the lobby of the first one, a roiling tidal wave of ash and debris. As befits a new-style disaster film, spectacle is subsumed in subjective experiencein this case, being buried alive.
Pinned beneath 20 feet of rubble, the two cops might be coal miners in a caved-in shaft. (Cage's character is physically constrained; like his director, the actor is effectively subdued.) But World Trade Center  draws heavily on Stone's wartime experienceas well as Hollywood  war movie conventions. The guys cite G.I. Jane : "Pain is your friend." Not just the WTC but battlefield and home front have collapsed. These casualties are devoted family men who share their situation with wives waiting at home for a uniformed messenger of death. Bello is a study in controlled anguish while Maggie Gyllenhaal 's pregnant Allison Jimeno  is all elbows, rushing headlong in and out of her New Jersey frame house.
Stone has dutifully repeated his studio-given mantra that World Trade Center  is "not a political movie." (As if that were possible: Even the musical cues suggest the mawkish piano doodling that's been a campaign ad staple since Reagan ran for re-election.) But once Stone uncorks a virtual crane shot up from the pile to a communications satellite and then the Whole World Watching, a context unavoidably appears. The first responder is a heroic George Bush , followed by a Sheboygan  police officer excoriating the "bastards," and then another guy exclaiming, "This country's at war!" Somewhere in Connecticut, an ex-Marine who likes to be called Staff Sergeant (Michael Shannon ) gets the heavenly call and marches to the rescue: "God made a curtain with the smoke to shield us from what we're not yet ready to see," he says as he approaches the pile.
What hath Oliver wrought? For the hard right, Stone is the most hated "Hollywood liberal" postJane Fonda  and preMichael Moore . But World Trade Center  is Stone's rehabilitation. It's not just courage that's honored, it's God's Will. It isn't only men who are saved, it's their familiesand their family values. Raised from the dead, John pays Donna the ultimate tribute: "You kept me alive."
The key to converting disaster into entertainment is uplift. You may not be convinced by the suggestions of divine interventionStone doesn't seem to have beenbut then World Trade Center  obeys a more crucial show business commandment. By focusing on two of the 20 people pulled alive from the pile that crushed some 2,700, the movie employs the Schindler's List  strategy: Spectators can invest their emotions in the handful of individuals miraculously chosen to survive the disaster rather than the overwhelming anonymous multitude who perished.
"It brought out the goodness," a voiceover concludes. It is inspiring that John and Will headed into the WTC; it is heartwarming that Staff Sergeant searched for them. Last seen, he's looking ahead to his next mission: "They're going to need someone out there to avenge this." Is it possible to conceive of 9-11 as anything other than the narrative put forth by George W. Bush? Stone's end title notes that Staff Sergeant subsequently served two tours in Iraq . Who will extricate our brave soldiers from the rubble of that disaster?
