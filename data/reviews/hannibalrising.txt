Writer Thomas Harris, creator of legendary Hollywood sociopath Dr. Hannibal �the Cannibal� Lecter, has been asked countless times over the last 25 years how it was his hero came to be a monster. Apparently readers and viewers aren�t satisfied with the hours of gruesome fun Hannibal has provided them; they want to get the good doctor on a leather couch and peel back a few layers: �Tell me about your mother, Dr. Lecter.� Well, as the man said, when the gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers, and now Harris has given us our answer: Hannibal Rising
, an uninspired and altogether unnecessary biography of a madman. When we first meet him, Hannibal is just an average boy of 7 or 8, passing a happy hour with his beloved little sister, Mischa (Tachovska), outside their family�s castle in Lithuania during the winter of 1944. Times being what they are, however, and Lithuania being where it is, the Lecter family estate is quickly becoming a battleground for Hitler�s and Stalin�s armies, so that hour is cut short by air strikes and tank assaults. Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, Hannibal and Mischa�s parents are killed, and the two children are taken hostage by a band of sinister, growling Lithuanian bandits. Long story short: The winter grows long, the food runs short, the bandits get hungry, Mischa starts to look more and more like a giant turkey leg, and, in the end, poor Hannibal is left without a sister, replaced by a deep well of boiling hostility. Upon escaping to France eight years later � troubled all the while by nightmares and an unnatural affinity for sharp metal objects � he begins the long, hard slog toward revenge. Revenge? That�s the answer? How unimaginative, how unsatisfying, how entirely unlike our Hannibal. Surely the roots of that madman�s bloody, fleshy desires run deeper than mere neuroses and childhood trauma, down into the realm of severe asocial neurological dysfunction. That�s the Hannibal Lecter Anthony Hopkins presented so deliciously in The Silence of the Lambs
, and his near-operatic pathology was the reason we kept watching through two sequels. Unfortunately, Hopkins is nowhere to be found in Hannibal Rising
. Instead we get Ulliel, an elegantly chiseled cipher with minimal acting talent and a laughable accent that would make a late-night TV creep-show host blush (�Good eeeeeeveniiing,� he oozes, like a B-movie Dracula). All the seductiveness is gone from Hannibal, as is the riddle behind his motivation, and what remains is the whining of an adolescent with a taste for human flesh. By erasing all the mystery from Lecter�s past, Harris and director Webber have also stripped him of his ability to terrify (who�s going to lose sleep if he noshes on a few Nazis?), and their film, though gory and violent enough, is almost entirely devoid of shock or suspense. Who would have thought mass murder and cannibalism could be so dull?


No matter when in the week your garbage is picked up, the arrival of "Hannibal Rising" at your megaplex guarantees that it's trash day somewhere.
Formerly masterful novelist Thomas Harris continues to pimp out the serial-killing cannibal he (and Anthony Hopkins) made famous, adapting his recent novel for the screen. The movie drags us back to the Lithuania of World War II, where we learn that the spark for Hannibal's murderous zeal is the Nazis. Who else?
The news is completely dubious. But the movie runs with it anyway.
We watch a particularly vicious pack of mongrel Eastern Bloc militiamen descend on Lecter Castle. The only survivors are young Hannibal and his itsy-bitsy sister Mischa, whom the men eventually boil and eat. So that's how it all began!
As if to say, "Look at how restrained we can be," the movie spares us the specifics, promptly flashing forward eight years, where a vengeful teenage Hannibal is now played by the 22-year-old Frenchman Gaspard Ulliel. His accent is vague, but those glowers and smirks could kill -- although probably not quite as well as all the swords and cutlery deployed here. (Early on at a Soviet orphanage, a delighted Hannibal wields a sickle in the film's loudest symbolism alert.)
The plot speeds our protagonist from Eastern Europe to Paris, by way of train, truck bed, and line-drawn-across-a-map montage. In France, he lands at the country chateau of his uncle. The uncle is dead, but, boy, is his widow alive. Her name is Lady Murasaki, and brave Gong Li phonetically feels her way through another stupid, sexed-up role in English.
This woman could use a "Volver" right about now. Until then, she's here, teaching Hannibal the ways of the samurai (call it "Kill Billions"), following him to medical school, and digging him out of jams. When he's stuck in an interrogation with an inspector (Dominic West), for instance, she conveniently sticks the head of the victim on a gatepost across from the police station. Phew.
At some point those Nazis resurface, led by a slithering Rhys Ifans, and Hannibal uses them to perfect his nascent culinary skills. Anyone curious about what the good doctor was cooking back in the day will get a mouthful. ("Cheeks" is the word.)
Director Peter Webber ("Girl With a Pearl Earring") and his crew give "Hannibal Rising" a clean, professional look. For better and worse, the movie is more attractive and competently assembled than its schlock peers.
That's refreshing, but it hardly excuses the appalling lack of suspense, intermittent tastelessness, or shockingly low camp quotient.
In writing the screenplay, Harris left out much of the novel's good stuff, including lines like this one from Lady Murasaki to Hannibal: "If you are scorched earth, I will be warm rain." Three decades after "Red Dragon" and " The Silence of the Lambs" gave the world a Lecter of chilling psychological darkness, Harris is prostituting himself to the teen-horror market with a younger, more athletic man-eater. His desperation has its amusements. It's funny watching an author try to retrofit a monster with moral relativism.
Nonetheless, Dr. Lecter offers us nothing new in the way of lethal ingenuity. As a gourmand, though, it's a different story. Hannibal might have overstayed his welcome in the horror genre, but he could rehab his tarnished star the way other diminished celebrities have -- with a stint on a reality television show. The next season of "Top Chef" would suddenly be very interesting.


         Lacking the wit to qualify as a sick joke, the ongoing saga of Hannibal Lecter has become the Grand Guignol
 equivalent of a shaggy-dog story, a rambling, directionless yarn whose promising beginnings have been eclipsed by its stubborn failure to end.
 
  A self-styled "origin story" of the kind that normally explains why Peter Parker can cling to walls, "Hannibal Rising" completes Hannibal Lecter's evolution from blood-curdling bogyman to comic-book ghoul. The character has always had his satirical side, at least since Anthony Hopkins took the reins from Brian Cox, who played Lecter in 1986's "Manhunter." Part of the thrill of "The Silence of the Lambs" is watching Hopkins do a tap-dance on the edge of self-parody, suppressing a giggle as he sucks air through his teeth. Confined to the shadows and caged in his cell, he is concentrated evil doled out by the drop, a dash of spice added to an already-simmering brew.
 


         






    Movie monsters flourish in the dark, but "Silence's" sequels have dragged Hannibal Lecter firmly into the spotlight. With steadily diminishing returns, "Hannibal" and "Red Dragon" elevated the man-eating gourmet from supporting act to star player, eroding the police-procedural framework that once kept him from roaming the screen at will. With "Hannibal Rising," all pretexts are dispensed with, all distractions tossed aside. Hannibal Lecter is ready for his close-up.
 
  Clad in form-fitting turtlenecks like a Rive Gauche art student, Gaspard Ulliel plays the teenage Lecter as a petulant angel of vengeance, seeking retribution for his younger sister's death at the hands — and, more to the point, teeth — of a gang of Nazi collaborators led by Rhys Ifans' gleefully sadistic Grutas.
 
  Although it begins in the muck of war-torn Lithuania, "Hannibal Rising" quickly decamps for postwar Paris, where Lecter studies anatomy while tracking down his sister's murderers. Drawing on his newly acquired talent for dissection, Lecter picks off his adversaries one by one, savoring the kill as well as the soft flesh of their cheeks.
 
  Wedded firmly to Lecter's point of view, the movie savors them as well, lingering on the sound of a stout rope slowly removing a man's head from his body. Though it has nothing on the Rube Goldberg death machines of the "Saw" series, "Hannibal Rising" thrives on the same sick fascinations. Lecter was once a necessary evil indulged for the sake of catching killers. Now, he's the main event, the psychopath as tragic hero.
 
  The blame for the character's devolution lies squarely with Thomas Harris, whose post-"Silence" novels betray an attempt to gin up his waning interest in the lucrative franchise. Bad as Harris' "Hannibal Rising" screenplay (his first) is, at least it's an improvement on his dreadful book, streamlining its convoluted action and discarding large chunks of unspeakable dialogue. Credit director Peter Webber for undercutting some the novel's baroque touches, although if all its excesses were excised, there'd be little left.
 
  Retained, unfortunately, is Lecter's widowed aunt, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li), a preposterous compendium of Orientalist clichés whose main function is to dignify her nephew's bloody crusade. Although he's juxtaposed with a law-and-order Nazi hunter (Dominic West) who wants to send war criminals to the guillotine with heads intact, the movie leaves little doubt that Lecter is doing the Lord's work, even using the devil's methods.
 
  Ulliel digs into his role with gusto, salaciously licking blood from his motorcycle gloves and flashing a demonic grin.
 
  But the movie's conception of Lecter is too circumscribed, giving no hint of the bottomless bloodlust to come. He can't match the glee that pops into the eyes of Ifans' vulturous would-be Nazi as he shoots a disloyal SS captain in the head. Even in his own movie, Hannibal Lecter gets upstaged. It's enough to make you eat your heart out.
 
 "Hannibal Rising." MPAA rating: R for strong grisly violent content and some language/sexual references. Running time: 2 hours. In general release.
   


A killer career is launched in "Hannibal Rising," which explains how the character most famously played by Anthony Hopkins became the cunning cannibal of later repute. With first-time scenarist Thomas Harris adapting his own novel, and "Girl With a Pearl Earring's" Peter Webber the somewhat unlikely directorial choice, this upmarket slasher is a well-produced but slow-moving thriller that never quite roars to life. Biz in most territories should be at least initially robust, though brand recognition will probably carry pic into midrange numbers of "Red Dragon" as opposed to the B.O. bonanzas of superior "Silence of the Lambs" and "Hannibal."
The novel, published just two months ago, was derided by many as a quickie screenplay cash-in beneath the author's usual standards. There were also complaints that in providing a victim-scenario background to account for Hannibal Lecter's mayhem, Harris had replaced his mystery with pop-psych banality.
Latter may remain a problem for those who view Lecter as some sort of sacred screen text (bloggers, start your engines), but on its own terms this story works better on celluloid than it did on the page. Nonetheless, "Rising" emerges as a bit of a wet fuse, never especially involving or suspenseful.
In 1944 Lithuania, the aristocratic Lecter clan abandon their castle to Nazi invaders, but their hunting-lodge refuge gets caught in the crossfire between Allies and Axis. Everyone is killed save young Hannibal (Aaron Thomas) and sister Mischa (Helena-Lia Tachovska), who's little more than a toddler.
Their lot grows yea worse when local hooligans led by Grutas (Rhys Ifans) show up. They can't leave for fear of being shot as looters; it's winter, and game and food are scarce. "We eat or die," Grutas snarls, pinching Mischa's plump cheeks very much like the witch did Gretel's.
Eight years later, now-teenaged Hannibal (Gaspard Ulliel, "A Very Long Engagement") is back at the castle -- albeit as a ward of the state, his ancestral home now a Soviet orphanage. He refuses to speak, but makes his violent temper felt in other ways. After making sure a mean senior boy gets a nasty comeuppance, he runs away, heading west.
At last he arrives in rural France, where his uncle's Japanese widow, Lady Murasaki (Gong Li), takes him in. Her kindness gets him to speak again, and her convenient supply of inherited samurai swords provides one form of training for future tasks. Others are supplied by a chef's gastronomical advice, and by the intimate knowledge of other fleshy substances Hannibal acquires as a medical student.
After dispatching a loutish butcher (Charles Maquignon) who'd insulted Lady Murasaki, Hannibal moves with her to Paris and begins his real course of study: tracking down the men who "ate my sister." This first requires a trip back to Lithuania, where he discovers most of the culprits are now handily located back in France.
The trail of severed heads (another samurai tip) that begins to pile up attracts Inspector Popil (Dominic West), a war-crimes investigator aware that these new victims were themselves thieves, murderers and Nazi collaborators. Hannibal's quarry also become aware of his intentions, taking preventative measures that eventually include kidnapping Lady Murasaki. But Hannibal is always one gory step ahead of them.
Halfway through, pic turns into the expected series of grotesque revenge killings, yet it still lacks emotional urgency and real scares -- partly because the script is so patly set up to justify whatever havoc our protag wreaks. Also, Lady Murasaki and Inspector Popil make weak foils, cottoning on to Hannibal's plans early on but only kinda-sorta trying to stop him.
Former is an especially thankless part that Gong can't dimensionalize beyond looking weepy and lovely. Ifans gives good slimebag. And while Ulliel will no doubt peeve those looking for a junior Hopkins act-alike, he does bring intelligence and poise to a role that strays too little from one menacing, supercilious note.
Pic must be counted the least successful of the Lecter pics to date, as each prior film (even so-so "Red Dragon") had a more distinctive, assertive tone: "Manhunter's" eeriness, "Silence's" taut psychodrama, "Hannibal's" macabre Grand Guignol. Webber's perhaps too-steady hand manages to tamp down the potential silliness in a script that's never quite convincing and sports some clunky dialogue.
Production package is quite handsome, with a muted elegance to Ben Davis' lensing, Allan Starski's production design and Anna Sheppard's costumes. Tech aspects are all first-rate.

This comically fastidious telling of the Hannibal Lecter  origin story completes the extreme makeover of grindhouse fare that The Silence of the Lambs started 15 years ago. Meaning: Respectable audiences who wouldn't be caught dead at a (sniff!) horror movie  still want severed heads; they just want the bloody meal served on Royal Dalton  china. You couldn't find a fancier chef than Girl with a Pearl Earring  director Peter Webber , who backlights every smoke puff and clutters the frame with top-dollar tchotchkes as hungry young Lecter (Gaspard Ulliel ) hunts down the lean, flavorful Nazis who ate his chubby-cheeked sister. The movie is so fussily made that it's tempting to believe Hannibal Rising  is actually a massive deadpan joke on Lecter lovers. It's more tempting, anyway, than another round of distasteful hero worship centered on the myth of the suave mass murderer. (The movie even charts Lecter's path across Europe on a superimposed map as if he were Indiana freakin' Jones.) The truth is that Lecter was a lot more compelling as a glorified guest star than as the main attraction.
