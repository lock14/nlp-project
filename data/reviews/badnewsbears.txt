Kids and profanity will always be funny together, and, like mom and apple pie and steroids, they�re as American as the World Series. Michael Ritchie�s 1976 film The Bad News Bears
, about the travails of a band of epithet-prone misfit little leaguers and the boozehound coach (Walter Matthau) who teaches them to play ball the hard way, caught the invective and ran with it all the way home, scoring a massive box-office shut out and inadvertently becoming one of the first punk rock kids films of the modern era (tying with the debut issue of John Holstrom and Legs McNeil�s Punk Magazine
 for Most Offensively Entertaining Cultural Landmine of the Year). Think about it: pint-sized outsiders pulling a screw-the-rules fast one on the Establishment with teenage lust n� snot to spare. Punk as fuck, indeed. Richard Linklater�s new remake cleaves to the bone most of the way home, but is playing against far longer odds than Ritchie�s film ever did. What was once shocking � kids say the damnedest things, the li�l bastards! � is now, however, de rigueur
, and an easy out. And while Linklater�s version has its own unique pacing, mounting up more like a series of innings than a series of acts (even if you think you know how it ends, that bottom-of-the-ninth screwball still beans you silly), it lacks the screwball-to-the-noggin punch of the original. Not a lot that can be done about that now that the Sex Pistols are considered classic rock and John Waters is classic camp. Screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa of Bad Santa
 (who are credited alongside the original, now-deceased BNB
 scribe, Bill Lancaster) do their best to keep things edgy within the PG-13 framework, and they succeed more than they fail, but ultimately this outing fares better as a portrait of Billy Bob Thornton�s wayward coach Morris Buttermaker and his pre-cirrhosis reconciliation with fastballing daughter Amanda Whurlitzer (Kraft, deftly treading the razor�s edge between tomboy and proto-babe) than as a diamond-shaped comedy of errors. So many kids films bearing the raucous Bad News Bears
 stamp have come and gone since 1976 they�ve become a genre unto themselves, and an oversaturated one at that. That Linklater manages to make his remake as affecting as it is � and there are moments of pure goofball zaniness scattered throughout � is only surprising to those who haven�t been following his sublimely wild-carding career, ranging as it does from Slacker
 to The Newton Boys
 to Waking Life
. That said, The Bad News Bears
 is Thornton�s game all the way. The PG-13 precludes the "F" word, thereby likely knocking out some of Ficarra and Requa's choicer ripostes � la Bad Santa
, but the former Davy Crockett still manages to look pleasantly distilled to the essence of curdled masculinity and sloe gin-soaked self-loathing. With a chummy leer, no less, and a perpetual bevy of Hooter�s girls trailing behind him like the choking fumes of his ever-present cigarillos, Thornton�s Buttermaker, a former Major Leaguer for somewhat less than one inning, is the bad dad who yearns to make good, or, at least, better
. There�s a palpable, winning ease in the scenes between him and Kraft, and though it�s unlikely you�ll buy the Bears' ultimate sandlot redemption � we�ve seen it too many times before � it�s a gas to see this seventh-inning stretcher-case downshift into hero mode, finally.


Back in 1976, there were critics who panned the original ''Bad News Bears" because it relied on kids swearing to get laughs. Well, duh
. Pitched with the right spin, a tyke letting fly with a juicy cuss can seem an honest admission of all the things we're not supposed to say -- shock value as truth telling.
But what was also a novelty 30 years ago is one more scrape across the senses in these coarser, yet oddly more prim times. And so we have an exceedingly faithful 21st-century remake of ''Bad News Bears" that amps up the verbal raunch while insisting that the young players of the worst Little League team in the San Fernando Valley are innocents at heart.
The result is a sort of junior version of ''Bad Santa," and not just because Billy Bob Thornton has been cast as coach Morris Buttermaker, the reprobate ex-major leaguer played by Walter Matthau in the original. Thornton is easily the best thing about the new ''Bears." Dangerous where Matthau was cuddly, his Buttermaker has nothing remotely lovable about him, and that's why we like him. But the remake is stranded between pushing the scatological envelope and caving in to the formulas the 1976 movie established, and until the well-nigh foolproof ending, it comes up gasping for air.
First off, you probably shouldn't take young children to this movie unless you want them coming out with friction burns on their ears. Our first sight of Buttermaker is in his day job as an exterminator, telling a client, ''No doubt about it, lady, you got a [expletive]-load of rats down there." Before hitting the field to take charge of the Bears -- he's been hired after uptight yuppie single mom Liz Whitewood (Marcia Gay Harden) has sued the league to let the cast-offs play -- the new coach empties out a can of nonalcoholic beer and fills it with bourbon. Scoping out a girls' softball team, Buttermaker murmurs, ''Look at the [expletive] on that second baseman." These are the more printable lines of dialogue. There are also shout-outs to Hooters and the pleasures of sleeping with players' mothers.
The kids, of course, are even saltier, especially pint-size thug Tanner (Timmy Deters) and oversize hulk Engelberg (Brandon Craggs). The rest of the team is a motley crew of space cadets (Tyler Patrick Jones), wheelchair kids (Troy Gentile), and hamhanded ethnic types (Indian, Armenian, Mexican). The setup is maximized for glorious political incorrectness -- and yet the movie just isn't funny. Thornton's mad-dog line readings are reliable for rude laughs, but that's about it, and in the yawning spaces between the jokes there's a sadness about the uncertain life these kids lead that the movie has no idea what to do with.
The director, sadly, is Richard Linklater, the Austin-based indie genius of ''Slacker" and ''Dazed and Confused" who proved with ''The School of Rock" that he could play the studio game better than the hacks. Where Jack Black's manic approach provided ''School" with a motor, though, Thornton's too sneering and laid-back -- he's funny but at the expense of narrative momentum.
The kids don't really pick up the slack. They're a cute but uncharismatic lot, especially Jeff Davies as Kelly Leak, the rebel teen with a power stroke. Sammi Kraft just mopes in the old Tatum O'Neal role of Amanda Whurlitzer, 12-year-old latchkey kid and fastball pitcher.
''Bad News Bears" still comes to life once she shows up, and the final game against the rival team led by preening suburban stud Ray Bullock (Greg Kinnear) sends you out on a decent high. Thornton plays it close enough to the vest that his transformation from win-at-all-costs jerk to caring coach is even believable, and that's gravy in a movie like this. But the question dogging ''Bears" remains unanswered. Not why was it made -- if the original is fun, it's no work of genius -- but who, exactly, is it for?

         The remake of the 1976 kids' classic "The Bad News Bears" is directed by the talented and prolific Richard Linklater. Why? Good question. "It's the kind of film you couldn't get away with if it didn't have the successful lineage of the first film," Linklater told Entertainment Weekly recently. "If we didn't have the name 'Bad News Bears,' we couldn't be doing what we are doing." He was referring, no doubt, to the prodigious underage swearing. And the Hooters scene. And the part where Billy Bob Thornton, his expression hovering between modesty and childlike wonder, confesses to Marcia Gay Harden that he hasn't paid for sex in years. Three days later I can't stop thinking about it. It's a perfect Buddhist conundrum: To make an unmakable movie, one must but remake it.
 
  Meditate on that.
 


         






    Linklater is on to something, I think. Rather than sock us with another meta-elbow to the ribs (we've sustained more than is humane already, and summer isn't even over), the director of "Before Sunrise" and "Before Sunset" has rendered a straightforward, surprisingly faithful and definitely loving adaptation of the original, which starred Walter Matthau as a washed-up major league baseball player who gets hired to coach the world's most hopeless Little League team.
 
  This time, "Bad News Bears" stars Billy Bob Thornton as Morris Buttermaker, once a pitcher for the Seattle Mariners (the experience lasted 2/3 of an inning), now an unreliable pest exterminator, full-time drunk and the most inappropriate Little League coach ever. Buttermaker gets the job after Liz Whitewood (Harden), a lawyer and single alpha-mom, sues the league for excluding her nonathletic son and wins. Having opened a Pandora's box of last-to-be-picked types, she pays Buttermaker to take on the Bears, a team that neither knows how to play nor particularly wants to. They're mostly there to satisfy their parents' egos.
 
  Aside from stuffing it with jokes, writers Glenn Ficurra and John Requa ("Bad Santa") have preserved Bill Lancaster's original script to the point where it feels like a throwback to another time — specifically 1976, when a movie could be as cheerfully subversive as "The Bad News Bears" and still be considered appropriate for children. But that was 30 years and a million bike helmets ago. Despite their similarities, the original still somehow feels like it was made for kids. The remake feels like it was made for people who were kids in 1976.
 
  Mainly, this has to do with the cultural context. But there's also the rascally person of Billy Bob Thornton to consider. Matthau's Buttermaker was a lovable, cranky drunk, but Thornton's is another thing entirely. Lean, gray-haired, sporting a white-tipped Fu Manchu mustache and soul patch, his cheerful dissipation attracts women like moths to a blowtorch. Not only is he seduced by the megalomaniac powerhouse, Liz, but, like Snow White and her small woodland friends, a cluster of frolicking strippers also seems to hover around him wherever he goes. If it weren't for his daughter-figure, Amanda (Sammi Kane Kraft), you might be tempted to think him shallow.
 
  Aside from Liz's pint-sized Toby (Ridge Canipe); the team consists of Engelberg (Brandon Craggs), the defensive fat kid; Tanner (Timmy Deters), the overly aggressive shrimpy kid; Miguel and Jose Agilar (Carlos and Emmanuel Estrada), Mexican brothers who don't speak English; Ahmad Abdul Rahim (Kenneth Harris), a black kid who is bad at sports; and Timmy Lupus (Tyler Patrick Jones), the much-maligned "booger-eating moron." Ficurra and Requa have modified the original to mock current pieties (the testy Engelberg is on Atkins, which mostly means he keeps baggies of bacon in his pocket). The new Bears team also includes Hooper (Troy Gentile), the kid in the wheelchair; Prem (Aman Johal), the nerdy Indian kid with the laptop; and Garo Daragebrigadian (Jeffrey Tedmori), the Armenian kid whose dad ridicules his attempts to "do American stuff."
 
  At first, Buttermaker is what you might call a laissez-faire coach. But when his annoyance with Roy Bullock (Greg Kinnear), the Lycra-loving sports dad who coaches the rival team, reaches its limit, Buttermaker quits passing out drunk on the pitcher's mound and resolves to whip the Bears into shape. The first thing he does is look for Amanda (Kraft), his ex-girlfriend's daughter, whom he walked out on without saying goodbye. Amanda throws like a girl who's led several teams to championships (which Kraft has), and Buttermaker convinces her to join the team. Her presence in turn helps convince the talented Kelly Leak (Jeffrey Davies), a young Buttermaker in the buttermaking, to join as well.
 
  Mellow, athletic and preternaturally wholesome, Kraft is the opposite of the sharp Tatum O'Neal, who played Amanda in the original. With her slouchy shoulders, heavy lids and slightly jutting lower lip, she is more reminiscent of Matthau — or Droopy — than the chirpy, bird-like beauty O'Neal. The combination of Kraft's athleticism and lack of guile give her Amanda a child-like tenderness that makes for a better foil to Thornton's nervy Buttermaker.
 
  Demure parents may find the stripper jokes objectionable, or object to the scene where the team winds up at Hooters, singing along to Eric Clapton's rendition of "Cocaine" (though this is the funniest moment in the movie).
 
  But the most subversive thing about "Bad News Bears" is the idea that childhood is not always the greatest state to find oneself in. Sometimes it feels like a humiliating insult, alleviated only by the added injury of having to grow up. The most daring thing about "Bad News Bears" is the suggestion that a guy like Buttermaker might have something to teach the youth of America. He does. "You lie your ... off," he tells Garo, who is thinking about quitting rather than tell his father they lost another game. "It's the only way. Look, this is America. Tell them what they want to hear. You know ... 'I don't smoke.' 'She said she was 18'...."
 
  It's a remake. Then you do what you want.

It's a Christmas miracle: The legend of Bad Santa  has turned Billy Bob Thornton into the drunken, foulmouthed, lecherous lowlife most likely to have a salutary effect on young people who say ''enough already'' with the damn wizards and superheroes. In Bad News Bears , director Richard Linklater's swell, fair-ball remake of the well-loved, anti-PC 1976 sports comedy, Thornton picks up the Beer Can of Unwilling Leadership from Walter Matthau to play Morris Buttermaker, a seedy washout of a onetime ballplayer scrounged up to coach a gaggle of kid-size athletic misfits into becoming a youth baseball team.
Linklater and jovially dyspeptic screenwriters Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (they wrote Bad Santa   their crud cred is good) know enough to leave Bill Lancaster's original structure alone. (They also wisely retain the goofy grandeur of a soundtrack driven by Bizet's opera Carmen  olé.) Instead, the tweaks are subtle and unobtrusive, as Linklater  proven in School of Rock  to be a natural leader of yoots  brings transgression up to code for the 21st century of PG-13. New-era losers (the cast is a cheery scrum of relaxed kids, led by genuine whiz pitcher Sammi Kane Kraft in the role created by Tatum O'Neal) now include a rotten kid in a wheelchair. And Greg Kinnear provides bonus smarm as Buttermaker's nemesis, a coach with a high regard for his own crotch.

 Is there a movie role Billy Bob Thornton can't pull off? In Richard Linklater's enjoyable remake of Michael Ritchie's equally entertaining, considerably harder-edged 1976 comedy, "The Bad News Bears," Mr. Thornton  plays a womanizing drunk named Morris Buttermaker. Ornamented with tattoos and sporting a salt-and-pepper goatee, Buttermaker earns his keep by exterminating rats and other pests, a job that cramps neither his style nor his overweening self-regard. The rat catcher has a fondness for pneumatic women, but as a confirmed loner he walks and boozes alone, often while lead-footing through a Southern California wasteland in his wreck of a convertible.  Critics often complain about remakes, but Hollywood was cannibalizing its backlist before the movies started talking and the only things really bad about remakes are the same things that are bad in nonremakes: lousy filmmaking. In its basic outline, Mr. Linklater's comedy hews to the outline of the earlier film in the sense that the story still involves a broken-down former baseball player who, in exchange for an undisclosed sum, agrees to coach a pitifully inept team of young ballplayers. The kids in the new film look somewhat older than those in the original, closer to junior high than elementary school, and the girl who pitches for the team, Amanda Whurlitzer, is now played by an unknown (Sammi Kane Kraft) rather than an Academy Award winner (Tatum O'Neal).  The other obvious difference between the two films is Buttermaker, who as played by Walter Matthau was a vision of perfectly articulated decrepitude. With his banana nose, hunched shoulders and hustling ways, Matthau's Buttermaker had an unmistakably Nixonian cast, as if the disgraced president had made a wrong turn on his way home to California and accidentally landed in the San Fernando Valley instead of San Clemente. Matthau was only about five years older than Mr. Thornton when he starred in the first "Bears," but his character registers as considerably older, as if he had been neutered by disappointment, not just all that hooch. What was particularly striking about Matthau's interpretation wasn't a lack of heat, but an absence of cool. Mr. Thornton's Buttermaker is an altogether different kind of cat.  For one, this cat is actually a tomcat, a man who when he needs a business to buy the team uniforms finds his sponsors down at the local gentleman's club. (In the 1976 film, the uniforms proudly bear the legend "Chico's Bail Bonds.") If Mr. Thornton's coach has a more active sex life than Mr. Matthau's, it is partly because the two men register rather differently on screen. (It's hard to imagine Matthau married to Angelina Jolie, for one.) And, more pointedly, because the cultural climate has become paradoxically more vulgar and more censorious in the decades since the first film opened. So, while Buttermaker now squires around a woman whose eye-popping décolletage may inspire the youngest audience members to snuggle up with their mothers, the language in the original screenplay has been tamped down and sterilized.  Released three years after the wits at National Lampoon threatened to shoot a dog unless you bought the magazine and two years before "Animal House" hit the zeitgeist with yucks and mashed potatoes, the first "Bad News Bears" seemed very much a product of its anarchic times. In some ways, the irreverence of that film is best expressed by a string of epithets lodged at the team by one of the Bears themselves, Tanner, a towheaded squirt with a vocabulary as blue as that of Lenny Bruce. In the mid-1970's, when almost everyone but angry women and a few bomb-throwers seemed worn out by dissent and was rushing into narcissism, this sly sports comedy championed our cherished tradition of flipping the bird to anyone and everything, and during the bicentennial no less.  Despite the softened language, it is no surprise that Mr. Linklater took a shot at remaking a landmark comedy that hit American movie screens  the same year in which he set his own youth comedy, the autobiographical "Dazed and Confused." Working from a screenplay by the team that wrote "Bad Santa," Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, who build on Bill Lancaster's original script without either improving or gutting it, Mr. Linklater guides his story forward as smoothly as he did "School of Rock." Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and buoyed by fine supporting work from Greg Kinnear and Marcia Gay Harden, the director's latest effort won't rock your movie world, but the fact that he manages to keep the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty.  "Bad News Bears" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).  It has  smoking, drinking,  semicovered breasts and some adult language.

Faithfully retelling the 1976 comedy about a team of misfits and their slovenly, beer-swilling coach, the new "Bad News Bears" has adopted a somewhat raunchier tone but delivers enough laughs to go the distance. Billy Bob Thornton hews toward "Bad Santa" territory as he neatly slides into Walter Matthau's shoes, while the rest of the cast, alas, doesn't measure up. Too crude for younger kids, pic's sweet spot should be among teens and young adults who weren't even born when the first tykes-behaving-badly exercise took the field.
Director Richard Linklater struggles a bit with pacing (pic is 10 minutes longer than its predecessor and feels it), but Thornton's woozy delivery and the engaging subject matter mostly hold up. Working from a script credited to original scribe, the late Bill Lancaster, and "Bad Santa" alums Glenn Ficarra and John Requa, the changes prove largely cosmetic, ranging from finding a new if equally inappropriate team sponsor (though its predecessor is briefly shown) to altering the protagonist's day job from pool cleaner to pest control man.
Thornton plays Morris Buttermaker, a blink-and-you-missed-him big league pitcher who grudgingly agrees to coach a group of thrown-together kids in a hyper-competitive baseball league. Slightly sweetened to augment the political incorrectness, the roster now includes a lad in a wheelchair (Troy Gentile) as well as a nerd (Prem Lahiri) who doesn't know much about baseball but proves a whiz with batting percentages.
Greg Kinnear, meanwhile, is more smarmy than sinister (Vic Morrow, you are missed) as the overbearing coach of the league's perennial champs, reflecting just how prescient the original's underlying theme about over-involved parents was.
Brought in this time by a working single mom (Marcia Gay Harden), Buttermaker slowly begins to embrace the challenge of turning the Bears into winners. The turnaround stems from recruiting the fireballing 12-year-old girl (Sammi Kane Kraft) he taught to throw a mean slider while dating her mother and taking in a rebel (Jeffrey Davies) whose hobbies are upgraded from arcades to skateboarding.
There's no nice way to say this, but the quality of the kid performers is at best uneven and drags the pic down in the middle innings. A notable exception would be Timmy Deters as the diminutive and ever-combative Tanner, who bears such an uncanny resemblance to the character in the previous "Bears" one might suspect human cloning is involved.
Still, it's Thornton's show, and he drolly rattles off plenty of incongruously funny lines, from suggesting that baseball is "like dating a German chick" to complaining he's been saddled with coaching "bronze medalists in the Special Olympics." Pic also makes good use of its San Fernando Valley locations, which in a not-so-subtle bit of product placement have been updated to include post-game festivities at Hooters.
At a time when every third summer movie seems to be a remake, "Bad News Bears" is one of those rare concepts actually suited to an encore, since the ideas of outcast kids and parents living vicariously through their children remain current enough to account for much of the Bravo channel's primetime lineup. And though remakes are seldom hailed as good news creatively, they can at least be good company.

I was but a wee moviegoing shaver, but The Bad News Bears  (1976), possibly the least condescending Hollywood  film ever made about kids, tore up my suburban turf. At the stirring climax, when a bellicose, saw-voiced little shit named Tanner (Chris Barnes ) answered the triumphant baseball team's patronizing sportsmanship with a rousing call to "take your apology and your trophy and shove 'em straight up your ass!" I had a hero. Finally, a movie that called the cards on the Disney  Lie and dared to see the hard-nosed, adult-reamed, early-adolescent universe for what it was.
But the 1970s made such a stanky bloom inevitable; Bill Lancaster 's ultra-realist script gave the underdog sports movie a joyful flogging, and director Michael Ritchie  was, for a few movies, uniquely equipped to lift the rock on American hypocrisy. Richard Linklater 's new versionsans that bothersome article, which some marketing tapeworm had decided was one word too many for 2005's dimmer teenshas no point to make and little grace with which to make it. Being a retread, the original screenplay's beats and flourishes are traced out accordingly: Ne'er-do-well lout Buttermaker (Billy Bob Thornton ) is asked to coach a Little League  team of epic incompetency, which he does at first with drunken carelessness and then, later, with attention and unscrupulous ambition. The kids, hampered by various handicaps, immigration status, weight issues, and plain nerdiness, begin to win, with the help of an ace pitcher (Sammi Kane Kraft , as Buttermaker's ex-girlfriend's daughter) and an ace everything-else (Jeffrey Davies , as a local delinquent with talent).
What's been changed demonstrates what a difference 30 years makes: Buttermaker is no longer Walter Matthau 's slouchy, semi-articulate pool cleaner with a lazy thirst for beer in the dugout (I knew that guy) but Thornton, a rummy, tattooed, stripper-dating pest killer who, most unnecessarily, actually has a Major League backstory that's clumsily referred to whenever the plot needs an infusion of pathos. Matthau's Buttermaker had no reserve tanks of self-pity to tap; what little he knew about baseball came from a lifetime of watching. Thornton's loser isn't nearly as witty or convincing, and while Billy Bob's got this Bad Santa, fouling-the-brats-to-their-faces shtick down, and nobody has as much panache with stealth-fired profanities, there's a contrived disconnect with real life where there should be only connectedness.
Not to mention, spaz paradigm Lupus isn't a nose picker anymore, and when Buttermaker dishes out beer, it's nonalcoholic. Which would all be a fart in the wind if the film clicked, but Linklater seems at a loss with his inexperienced cast (only Timmy Deters, as Tanner, hits his lines with a thwack; Kraft, apparently cast for her pitching, belongs on Disney Channel  sitcoms). More often than not, the one-liners peter out like afterthoughts, when they're not repetitive (Thornton likens too many things to his own turds, and there are no fewer than two Helen Keller  howlers). Greg Kinnear , smugging up a dust devil as the gung ho car dealer opponent coach, is something less than two-dimensional. While the inspirational speeches sprout like crabgrass, gameplay-montage song interludes practically run over one another.
For all the care Linklater demonstrates with his camera and cuts, it's almost a movie Buttermaker could've made, but more irksome is the ordained focus on plot undulation and simplistic motivation, as if nobody remembered that the first film was a social satire. No more than Kicking and Screaming  (or God help us, the Keanu Reeves  headache Hard Ball ), Bad News Bears  is hardly the kids'-sports movie we need, but maybe it's as much as we can handle. There's no discomfiting America on view, only Hollywood.
