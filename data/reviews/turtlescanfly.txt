         In the opening scene of Iranian Kurdish director Bahman Ghobadi's "Turtles Can Fly," a cluster of Kurdistani children in Northern Iraq stands in a field holding up TV antennas like kites. ("Sexy channels" are prohibited by Saddam Hussein; news channels are not.) The antennas are for gathering information on the upcoming war, which might as well be Christmas for the excitement it's generated among villagers and refugees. Kak (Soran Ebrahim), an enterprising 13-year-old better known as Satellite, buys a dish and installs it on the roof of a village elder's house. When Bush and Rumsfeld finally appear on the TV, he translates: Mr. Bush predicts rain.
 
  Like the young characters in Italian neo-realist films like Vittorio De Sica's "Sciuscia" and Roberto Rossellini's "Germany Year Zero," the kids in "Turtles Can Fly" are hardened pragmatists, cured of sentimentality by war, poverty, ever-present landmines and Iraqi soldiers. These kids have seen it all — but they remain doggedly childlike in spirit. Ghobadi uses the lack of resources and the surfeit of drama that had been the lot of the Kurds throughout Hussein's dictatorship and both Gulf wars much in the way De Sica and Rossellini used the European tragedies of the '30s and '40s, also casting nonprofessionals, some with limbs lost to landmines studded throughout the Kurdish countryside like cloves on an Easter ham.
 


         






    We never learn how, exactly, Satellite became the leader of this tent city, but his acolytes follow him unquestioningly. He commands the undying loyalty of at least two trusty lieutenants: Pasheo (Saddam Hossein Feysal), who scoots along on crutches as if turbo-charged, and Shirko (Ajil Zibari), who cries almost constantly. Satellite generates income for himself and for the other kids by sending them out into the fields to collect unexploded landmines with their big, rustic baskets slung over their shoulders. The armless Hangao (Hiresch Feysal Rahman) calmly disarms mines using his teeth.
 
  The contradictions of life in a war zone are heartbreakingly visible in the face of 15-year-old Agrin (Avaz Latif), Hangao's sister, and the reluctant caretaker of a blind toddler named Rega (Abdol Rahman Karim). It's the face of a child broken by suffering. Satellite falls instantly in love with her ("I've been looking for a girl like you all my life"), but Agrin is incapable of reciprocating his feelings and rewards his wooing with impassive stares.
 
  There are very few adults in "Turtles Can Fly," and the ones that are around aren't good for much. Forced to make sense of their world, the children turn to Satellite, who spikes the information available to him with his own fond wishes. On hearing the sound of U.S. helicopters for the first time, Satellite calls it "the sound of American passports." And when the pilots drop fliers, he pretends to read: "Here it is written ... we are your best friends.... We will make your country a paradise." American soldiers may not make the battered Kurdistani countryside paradise, but they do get together with the kids at the end to watch the forbidden channels.
 
  "Turtles Can Fly" (the title refers to the liberation of death) isn't interested in presenting Satellite's belief in the transformative powers of American troops ironically. Nor does it reaffirm popular American notions about good guys and bad guys. Instead, it's a gentle, intelligent reminder of how small our world is, how similar we are, how porous our borders and our cultures — wars, bans and restrictions notwithstanding; and its sophisticated world-view is a gentle rebuke to provincial views of the world in American cinema.

urtles Can Fly" is the third feature film that Bahman Ghobadi, a Kurdish director from Iran, has made about the suffering and resilience of his people, who have the bad luck to live spread across the often volatile borders of several nation-states, including Turkey and Iraq. While the status of the Kurdish nation remains perilous, Mr. Ghobadi has set out to give the Kurds a national cinema, and to bring their traditions and their language, as well as their troubles, to the attention of global audiences. His new film arrives garlanded with awards from international film festivals. Like its predecessors - "A Time for Drunken Horses" and "Marooned in Iraq" (also known as "Songs of My Motherland") - it presents a harsh account of war, displacement and deprivation that is saved from utter bleakness by a tough, earthy lyricism. Like many other Iranian filmmakers, Mr. Ghobadi often uses children in his movies, for their guilelessness and vulnerability, and also because they are scrappy, stubborn and naturally funny. Adults are fairly peripheral in the world of "Turtles Can Fly," which is set in a mountainside village in Iraq that incorporates a swelling refugee camp. The time is early 2003, and the villagers wait, with a mixture of hope and trepidation, for the Second Gulf War to begin, and try to find news of its arrival. The chronology makes it a kind of sequel to "Marooned in Iraq," which took place just after the Persian Gulf war of 1991, when Saddam Hussein attacked the Kurds after his defeat by the American-led coalition. The war-weary Kurds in this film, foreseeing the end of Mr. Hussein's rule, also worry the American invasion will bring a new round of violence. Mr. Ghobadi filmed "Turtles" in Iraqi Kurdistan shortly after the end of major combat was declared, and he appears agnostic about whether the American intervention will improve daily life. Daily life, in any case, interests him more than politics, and his camera pushes through scenes of bustle and confusion, looking for moments of clarity. The people in the film, meanwhile, are impatiently searching for information. Among the first images we see is a hallucinatory vista of makeshift antennas propped up in a field, like lightning rods or windmills. Atop one of them is a lanky, nerdy boy, with oversize glasses and a backward baseball cap, whose nickname is Satellite (Soran Ebrahim). He is the village's main source of technical know-how, and later he lives up to his name by acquiring a dish that allows the local elders to peruse "prohibited channels" full of music videos before settling on Fox News, which Satellite pretends to translate for them. He serves as the de facto mayor of the local children, many of them orphans, who gather spent artillery shells and defused land mines to sell in the nearby town. Satellite's best friend has been maimed by a mine, as has Satellite's new rival, a boy who has lost his arms and who shows up one day with his sister and a baby whose parentage is mysterious. The hardships these children have faced are horrifying, and Mr. Ghobadi neither sweetens nor sensationalizes them, which makes "Turtles Can Fly" all the more painful to watch. It is a heartbreaking film, and cruelty sometimes seems to be not only its subject but its method. Like the child on a high cliff that is one of its recurring images, the film walks up to the edge of hopelessness and pauses there, waiting to see what happens next.

Bahman Ghobadi confirms his place as the poet laureate of Kurdish cinema with "Turtles Can Fly," an engrossing, nuanced pic about orphaned children in a refugee camp on the Iraq-Turkish border just prior to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Even more than in his very fine "A Time for Drunken Horses" and "Marooned in Iraq," Ghobadi in this pic displays a complete command of his art as he shifts between -- and even blends -- wrenching tragedy and amusing comedy. An excellent fest run seems assured, and aud interest in seeing another side of Iraq should spur considerable commercial interest in the West. 
As Abbas Kiarostami's former assistant, Ghobadi understands the power of stark, stripped-down images on screen, and he comes up with a stunner at pic's start: A squad of boys is seen hoisting giant TV antennae above their heads so their makeshift tent village can receive news from the outside world. At once, scene suggests a people's hunger for knowledge, their resourcefulness in the face of dire poverty and an absurdist contrast of high and low tech.
Type A personality Soran aka "Satellite" (Soran Ebrahim) knows this scheme won't work, and, as a young teen in charge of putting the camp's kids to work defusing land mines, he quickly decides to trade for a satellite dish. This leads to one of several hilarious sequences, where he has to deal with the conservative community elders, who don't want the racy cable channels shown, and is asked to translate Fox News' warmongering reporting into Kurdish.
Although Satellite at first appears obnoxious and is shown yelling and bossing younger kids around, he gradually becomes more sympathetic, especially in a complicated, testy relationship between him and Henkov (Hirsh Feyssal), who lost his arms in a mine explosion. Henkov, who seems to have a gift for prophecy, takes care of pretty Agrin (Avaz Latif) and little boy Risa, who may or may not be Agrin's child.
Increasingly, Satellite is drawn to Agrin, sensing he can be helpful to her and obviously attracted to her. Agrin speaks only when it counts, but Latif uses her face as a map to a badly damaged heart. Anguished and suicidal, Agrin tells Henkov that she wants to abandon Risa, fearing tragic consequences if she remains his mom. Where the boys in "Turtles" are often physically deformed (due to mines or Iraqi chemical weapons), Agrin, who was raped by Saddam Hussein's soldiers, is even more victimized internally.
Even as her tragic story develops, pic retains an astonishingly light-hearted spirit as Ghobadi follows Satellite and his go-getter projects. The two starkly different tones finally meld into one in a phenomenal scene set just after the U.S. invasion (actual Yank soldiers and tanks appear on screen), when a hurt Satellite is offered an arm broken off of a Saddam statue.
Ghobadi delivers a complicated view of the war: After early enthusiasm Donald Rumsfeld would applaud, the characters shrug off the actual invasion in the face of Agrin's horrific plight. Viewers expecting a rah-rah cheer for President Bush from the top Kurd filmmaker will be caught up short.
As he showed in "Drunken Horses," Ghobadi can pull amazingly rich perfs out of real non-pro kids, all of them enhanced by his terrific sense of humor. Instead of the vagabonds in "Drunken Horses" and "Marooned," the people in "Turtles" are stuck in one place -- a place that lenser Shariar Assadi makes sure is never prettified. Housein Alizadeh's music reaches chilling dramatic passages, in lock step with Moustafa Khergheposh and Hayedeh Safiyari's fine editing.

The first feature made in Iraq  since the fall of Saddam Hussein  belongs to a fecund Iranian cinema tradition, in which the experiences of kids double as allegories or microcosms of the society at large. So when a girl jumps off a cliff to her death in the flash-forwarded opening of Turtles Can Fly , there's no doubt that the void she leaps into is the region's foreseeable future. In Bahman Ghobadi 's third film, set on the eve of Operation Iraqi Freedom  and shot in a refugee camp on the Iraq-Turkey border, a boy can take on the role of parent, manager, translator, or paramedic; in early scenes, de facto youth leader Soran (Soran Ebrahim ), a/k/a Satellite, is looking for a TV dish so everyone can find out when the U.S. invasion starts.
A pragmatic, warm-hearted tough guy, Satellite is father figure and foreman to his fellow refugee children, whom he organizes in work gangsthey forage in scrap heaps and fields for unexploded mines, which they sell to local U.N.  personnel. Many of the kids are orphaned, maimed, or both. (A potential employer complains, "Half of them don't have hands"which later adds mordancy to the sight gag when one of Satellite's loyal henchmen presents him with a chunk of a famously fallen statue: "This is Saddam's arm. It's for you.") The arrival of Henkov (Hirsh Feyssal), an armless, grave-faced boy, vaguely intimidates Satellite's alpha status, since Henkov has a gift for both accurate prophecy and defusing mines with his teeth.
Henkov scours the minefields with his sister, pensive Agrin (Avaz Latif ), and a blind toddler who appears to be their little brotherand who's the unexpected focal point of Agrin's rage and desperation, the causes of which Ghobadi soon discloses. Faintly evocative at times of both Mouchette  and Marzieh Meshkini 's Stray Dogs , Turtles Can Fly  eschews the loose-limbed musical energies of Ghobadi's Marooned in Iraq  (2002) and revisits the basic milieu of his Caméra d'Or -winning A Time for Drunken Horses  (2000), wherein a determined band of orphaned youngsters eke out a skeletal living on an Iraqi border. Amid the muddy scrubbery of the camp and its hinterland surroundings, Ghobadi catches some striking compositions: a satellite dish bobbling along amid a bustling crowd, a distant row of men gripping aerials that reach high into the sky for news of the impending war. (This is as near as we get to any of the parents in the camp.)
Ghobadi, an Iranian Kurd, rarely steps back to cast a lingering gaze on his fine handiwork; like Satellite, the film is always charging on to the next pressing situation. Likewise, he has little patience for the formal niceties of narrative through-lines; he picks up and discards story strands (the doctor in search of an orphan, Satellite's crush on Agrin) at will. But the perpetual motion only temporarily staves off a pervading, self-evident despair. Circling around to its anguished beginning, Turtles Can Fly  closes with an open-ended question that only sounds like yet another threat: "Don't you want to meet the Americans?"
