Valiant
, an animated adventure about heroic homing pigeons in Great Britain during World War II, comes flying in on a wing and a prayer. With flatly drawn CGI characters and backgrounds, a script and direction that make no special use of the impressive voice talent assembled, and historical subject matter that's not likely to find many enthusiasts beyond the white cliffs of Dover, the future of Valiant
 does not appear to be high-flying. Enough. The movie makes use of every avian pun possible, a pattern that becomes quickly monotonous and predictable, if not contagious. Valiant (voiced by McGregor) is a small bird who believes that what matters most is not the size of one's wingspan but the size of one's spirit, and so enlists in the RHPS: the Royal Homing Pigeon Service. He first has to convince his mother that it's time for him to leave the nest, then undergo basic training before he and his Squad F buddies are sent on a perilous mission behind enemy lines. Throughout it all he keeps a stiff upper beak. And speaking of beaks, they're difficult features to animate for dialogue without turning the birds' maws into Silly Putty distortions. In fact, pigeons, in general, are not regarded as the loftiest or most attractive of birds, which makes the task of rendering them anthropomorphic and lovable all the more difficult. Produced in England and already released there, Valiant
 is just now getting its U.S. premiere. The movie�s takeoffs on old war-movie and RAF-flyboy cliches will certainly not connect with the knowledge base of America�s current youngsters, which will only cause Valiant
 to seem that much more foreign. An epilogue tells us that pigeons saved the lives of thousands during the war, and that 31 of the 53 top honors given to England�s animal war heroes were awarded to pigeons. I know I shouldn�t smirk, but isn�t that kind of honor that Trafalgar Square is for?


The voice cast of ''Valiant," a new computer-animated film that has just popped over from England, includes Ewan McGregor, Ricky Gervais of ''The Office," Tim Curry, Monty Python's John Cleese, ''House" star Hugh Laurie, character actor Jim Broadbent, and the lovely and talented Olivia Williams (''Rushmore"). The thought of this motley crew in the recording studio, laying down vocal tracks and cracking each other up, is far more entertaining than anything in the film. ''Chicken Run" it ain't.
But it's a kiddie movie, and I suppose you could do worse for a late-summer, air-conditioned 76 minutes at the multiplex. Not a lot
 worse, though. Set in the thick of World War II, ''Valiant" concerns itself with the plucky members of the Royal Homing Pigeon Service, whose mission is to carry important messages to and from the high command while dodging the claws of evil Nazi falcons led by the suitably Darth Vaderish Von Talon (Curry). Yes, it's that weird.

Our hero is Valiant (McGregor), a pint-sized but enthusiastic new recruit who signs up for basic training under the ramrod tutelage of Broadbent's Sargeant. His platoon-mates include an upper-class twit (Pip Torrens), two big and agreeably dumb brothers (Brian Lonsdale and Dan Roberts), and Bugsy (Gervais), a con-artist city pigeon who has enlisted only to hide out from a couple of angry magpies looking to shake him down. There's also a pretty nurse (Williams), but when Valiant and she start puffing out their breast feathers at each other, you may get the willies.
The training sequences are a dumbed-down mishmash of every army movie ever made -- offered with the confidence that your children haven't seen any of them -- but ''Valiant" does stagger into flight once the platoon embarks on a mission to occupied France, where they encounter a couple of French Resistance mice (cue the Edith Piaf) and more of those falcons. The latter factor heavily in the climactic sequence, which features Valiant rescuing a loopy imprisoned pigeon played by Cleese, showing his mettle to RHPS commander Gutsy (Laurie), and saving the day by hiding a top-secret message in his little pigeon crop. He presents it to Gutsy covered with slime, which grossed me right out but delighted the 8-year-old I happened to bring along to the screening.
Still, much of ''Valiant" seemed pitched below even her level, to the 5-and-younger crowd who don't really need to know why
 cowardly Bugsy has an unexplained change of heart in time to help assist in the heroics. The digital artwork by the new British company Vanguard Animation is bright and uncomplicated and nowhere near as sophisticated as anything Pixar
 or DreamWorks have done -- you can feel the vectors holding the scenery up -- and a larger unsolved problem is that pigeons are, well, ugly
.
From this parent's point of view, the best part about ''Valiant" was the chat about the French Resistance and Normandy on the drive home -- how often does your kid ask for historical clarification? Otherwise it may be a cute enough movie but not at current market rates: two parents, a handful of children, and multiplex grub will probably bring your total to more than $50, which translates to ''Valiant" costing about 67 cents per minute of your time. The top-secret message this pigeon is carrying reads ''Wait for the DVD."

         I'm pretty sure that the point of computer-generated animation is not to make the audience feel as though it's been trapped inside a large plastic box for an hour and a half, but given how often I stumble out of theaters gasping for air lately, it seems that way.
 
  The trouble with technology is that it too often gets in the way of artistry or dispenses with it altogether. This is the big problem with "Valiant," an English-produced CG animated feature about World War II homing pigeons that would have been much better served had it been stylishly drawn cell by cell — a thought that occurred to me as I passed a framed set of gorgeously expressionistic cells from the original "101 Dalmatians" on my way out of the building on the Disney lot. Instead, "Valiant" looks cheap, garish and less than cutting-edge. Talk about revenge of the nerds.
 


         






    The story of a runt pigeon named Valiant (voice of Ewan McGregor) who dreams of joining the Royal Homing Pigeon Service, an elite squadron of messenger pigeons assigned to relay messages between the British and the French Resistance, "Valiant" is an unconscionably dreary and amateurish-looking thing, and the rote plot and annoyingly predictable script — a compendium of bird puns, mostly — don't work nearly hard enough to make up for the hammy awfulness of the images.
 
  For one thing, the pigeons look not even remotely like pigeons. If I had to guess as to the origin of their species, I'd say they were the product of the unholy union between a handful of British A-listers and a gaggle of turduckens, but I'd rather not speculate. Rendered in hideous, '80s-era pastels and looking oddly oil-slicked, as though fresh from a cruise on the Exxon Valdez, the pigeons exist in a depressing artificial universe in which it's nearly impossible to distinguish interiors from exteriors, day from night. The backgrounds are flat and static, and the camera appears to have been nailed down to prevent it from defecting to Pixar.
 
  Instead of good character and scene design, we're given pointless, hyper-realist close-ups of feathers. Instead of panoramic, well-populated shots of Trafalgar Square, pigeon capital, incidentally, of the world, we get a close-up of a granite pedestal and a single grubby pigeon. (Sure is nubby, though.) For a movie that traffics in bird puns as though they were the last word in kinder humor, a bird's-eye view of the square, the city, is sorely missing.
 
  The story begins when Valiant's town is visited by the heroic Wing Commander Gutsy (Hugh Laurie), who is recruiting badly needed pigeons shortly before the invasion at Normandy in 1944.
 
  With the encouragement of the peg-legged publican Felix (John Hurt), Valiant goes off to London, where he meets a repellent con-pigeon named Bugsy (Ricky Gervais, in full David Brent mode) and signs up.
 
  After a brief training period, the less-than-elite Squad F — which includes the aristocratic Lofty (Pip Torrens) and the hooligan brothers Toughwood (Brian Lonsdale) and Tailfeather (Dan Roberts) — is shipped off to France, where a downed pigeon named Mercury (John Cleese) has been taken prisoner by the nefarious German Falcon Von Talon (Tim Curry).
 
  Inspired by true-ish events (the British military did indeed use messenger pigeons during the war and even had a medal specifically for heroic animals), "Valiant" wants to be the "Saving Private Ryan" of animated war movies. Instead (and the characters are just as hard to tell apart) it's their "The Great Raid."

Valiant  opens with a newsreel from ''the Department of Pigeon Propaganda'': The Allies need brave pigeons  like eager, featherweight Valiant (Ewan McGregor)  to carry secret messages to the front. Who recruits and trains these pigeons? Other pigeons, who wear clothes and take little notice of humans. Precious few of those warlike primates are glimpsed at all, in fact. It's a pigeon's army and a pigeon's world. But it's not, of course, a pigeon's war. This disconnect between birdkind and mankind isn't a huge narrative problem...since there's very little narrative to worry about, anyway. Wee Valiant joins up, gets an impossible mission, faces some Teutonic falcons, pulls a no-bird-left-behind with war buddy Bugsy (Ricky Gervais), and so forth.
But such conceptual laziness (why, exactly, does a Nazi bird have a human-size portrait of himself?) does make you appreciate the clever artistry of a Chicken Run  or Finding Nemo , where great care has been taken to cultivate a talking animal's essential ''humanity'' while leaving him firmly embedded in his natural milieu. Such delicate considerations clearly did not burden the pixel pushers behind Valiant. The production house, Vanguard Animation, was birthed by Disney as an alternative to pricey, lapidary Pixar  which might be why this movie's aesthetics seem governed by its bottom line: The CG is on the rubbery side, and the backdrops are jarringly 2-D. But Valiant  isn't so hard to look at  it's hard to listen to. The script is gabby and flabby in the first act, and the dialogue is balsa-wood inanity outside of Gervais' better bits. (''Maybe I'm not conscientious,'' says the rogue, attempting desertion, ''but I do object.'') On the other hand, the difficult issues of avian flatulence and bulimia are finally addressed. Vividly.

 "It's not the size of the wingspan, it's the size of the spirit," declares Valiant (Ewan McGregor), the brave but undersize homing pigeon who passes for a war hero in the bland Disney animated film named after him. Valiant, you see, is small enough to steal into enemy headquarters by squeezing himself down the barrel of a gun.  His too-cute motto exemplifies the goody-goody tone of this World War II cartoon in which the British Royal Air Force has morphed into the Royal Homing Pigeon Service, or R.H.P.S. The German Luftwaffe has become a flock of sadistic falcons decked out in shiny black leather and matching eye patches, obsessing neurotically about the colors of their capes.  It's not giving much away to say about this poorly plotted, suspense-free film that the little homing pigeon with superior spiritual girth becomes a hero by carrying a message to the good guys about a change of locale for the Normandy invasion. He gets a little help from a pair of French rodents whose mouse division is led by a sultry female warrior named Charles De Girl (Sharon Horgan); her appearance is accompanied by (what else?) strains of Edith Piaf.  As a reward for it all, Valiant gets a smooch from a friendly nurse, Victoria (Olivia Williams), with whom he has exchanged no more than a sentence or two before the I-love-yous. Victoria bears a strong physical resemblance to Daisy Duck. In fact, the movie's whole crew of fussily designed fowl looks more like ducks and chickens than pigeons. Valiant  is so lacking in distinguishing characteristics, including Mr. McGregor's colorlessly chipper delivery, that he is practically faceless and therefore instantly forgettable.  Most of the other pigeons in his unit, Squad F, including the twin lugs Toughwood and Tailfeather (Brian Lonsdale and Dan Roberts) and the foppish twit Lofty (Pip Torrens), are also characters in search of greater definition.  There is no effort to resolve the incongruity of the movie's semirealistic images of guns, tanks and aircraft with the ethereal play of animated birds flitting around and comically smashing into things. When Squad F crosses the English Channel on a mission to contact the French Resistance, you may wonder why the pigeons have to be transported in cages aboard a military aircraft. Shouldn't they fly on their own steam?  The jarring juxtaposition of metal and feathers is not the movie's only conceptual confusion. Computer animation in the post-"Toy Story" style to which "Valiant" belongs requires narrative chiaroscuro of comparable sophistication, and it's just not here. The thudding old-fashioned screenplay abounds with hearty slogans and mild avian puns mouthed by shopworn British stereotypes. So much of the dialogue is shouted (sometimes only semi-intelligibly) that entire sections of the movie sound like protracted hollering. "Valiant" is in dire need of some "Shrek"-ian sass, not to mention a drop or two of genuine emotion.  A slew of wonderful British actors do what they can to lend personality to their underwritten characters. Jim Broadbent is the bellowing R.H.P.S. training sergeant and Hugh Laurie the preening wing commander Gutsy, who likes his bug juice shaken not stirred. John Cleese is Mercury, a cheeky prisoner of war who runs off at the mouth nonsensically when his falcon captor administers truth serum.  That all-purpose crypto-Nazi, General Von Talon (Tim Curry), hums Wagnerian themes as he busies himself with his wardrobe. When interrogating Mercury he growls the inevitable warning, "We have ways of making you squawk." Ricky Gervais is the movie's potentially most complex character, Bugsy, a seedy, cynical con artist and shirker who deserts his mates, then reconsiders and returns to the fold. Why the change of heart we are never told.  For all its feathery frivolity, there is no escaping the repugnant fact that "Valiant" is a war movie for kids. To be sure, the war being waged by Valiant and his crew is the so-called "good war," and Squad F is on the side of the angels. But it's a war nonetheless.

Lackluster CGI toon "Valiant" features an all-avian cast of characters and top-flight British vocal talent to spoof fondly WWII fly-boy dramas like "The Battle of Britain." However, despite a handful of good aerial "birdfight" sequences, "Valiant" fails to get off the ground due to a by-numbers script and dodo-ugly character design that add up to less than one would expect from "Shrek" producer John H. Williams. Thanks to strong marketing in the U.K., pic looked set to soar at the B.O. in its Easter weekend opening there, but may lay an egg in the U.S. upon its August 19 release, leaving Buena Vista/Disney to feather its nest with ancillary.

Based loosely on the fact real-life carrier pigeons played a significant role during WWII, the pic plays the classic raw-recruit-becomes-a-hero story arc with a beak-featured cast. Ewan McGregor, assaying a second animated gig after "Robots," voices young Valiant, a patriotic wood pigeon inspired by the heroic exploits of squadron leader Gutsy (Hugh Laurie) to join the Royal Homing Pigeon Service (RHPS).
In a curiously empty Trafalgar Square -- pic's budget seemingly didn't stretch to animating extras here -- Valiant meets Cockney conbird Bugsy ("The Office's" Ricky Gervais) who ends up enlisting to evade some thuggish magpies.
Dullish midsection sees Valiant and Bugsy going through training under supervision of a hard-ass sergeant (Jim Broadbent). The lads' feathered friends in Squad F include twittering posh bird Lofty (Pip Torrens), and muscled but dim Geordie twins Toughwood and Tailfeather (Brian Lonsdale and Dan Roberts, respectively). Slapstick flying into walls to establish ineptitude of Squad F, along with copious fart jokes courtesy of Bugsy seem to rep the pic's idea of funny.
Clumsily intercut are scenes showing the interrogation of RHPS fighter Mercury (John Cleese) at the claws of Nazi falcon General von Talon (Tim Curry) in order to ascertain the hideout of the French Resistance.
Squadron F is finally given a mission to fly across the English Channel to collect a message from the Resistance, occasioning pic's only truly laugh-out-loud line from a reluctant Bugsy, who offers the very David Brentish, "Maybe I'm not that conscientious, but I do object."
Enemy attack as the bird squad crosses the Channel is exciting and competently enough animated to distract from nagging logical questions such as why, if they're birds, do they have to take a plane and parachute into France in the first place.
Unfortunately, "Valiant's" best bits are too few and arrive too late to amuse all but very young children and aficionados of vintage Brit war films.
Comparisons will be inevitable with Aardman Animations-DreamWorks similarly British-made, avian-themed 2000 effort "Chicken Run," which more lightly evoked a WWII-atmosphere via reference to "The Great Escape."
Like "Chicken Run," "Valiant" struggles with the inherent difficulties of making bird characters both cute and, well, bird-like. Lumpy, bulgy-eyed and only recognizable as pigeons through an intense effort of will on the audience's part, the cast of "Valiant" appears even more ungainly than "Chicken Run's" half-hatched plasticine poultry, although CGI allows for more convincing feather textures.
Still, in terms of gags-per-reel and sheer inventiveness, the flawed but likable "Chicken Run" has the drop on old-fashioned and bland "Valiant," which serves best to illustrate how far the bar has been raised for animated fare. In fact, the trailer for Blue Sky Studios' "Ice Age 2" reaped the biggest laugh at the London screening caught for "Valiant."
Vocal perfs are fine, if disappointing, given the firepower of the cast. McGregor's warm tenor perks up Valiant, though Gervais, a performer with great improvisational gifts, seems penned in by the dry script. Curry brings characteristic brio to the main baddie role.
Rest of the tech package is serviceable, with George Fenton's low-key but savvy mimicry of rousing WWII-era scores providing the standout element.

Sublimating the horrors of World War II into patriotic, action-packed children's entertainment should be grounds for a court-martial, but I'll let the makers of Valiant  off with a slap on the cheek. According to the film's postscript, homing pigeons aided the war effort. Fine. But do they really deserve their own blandly heroic animated fable, in which human lifelet alone mass deathdoesn't even exist? The story follows the diminutive titular bird (voiced by Ewan McGregor ) as he answers the Dept. of Pigeon Propaganda 's call to action for a wartime messenger task that remains entirely nebulous. Valiant and his crew mostly avoid the bad guys and crack wise, leaving no shred of bird terminology un-punned. ("We have ways of making you squawk," gloats a gleeful Nazi falcon to his pigeon P.O.W.) The main problem with this Disney  releasewhich also wastes the voices of Ricky Gervais  and Jim Broadbent is its refusal to recognize the war as anything but an excuse for tomfoolery. As education by anthropomorphism goes, Maus  this ain't.
