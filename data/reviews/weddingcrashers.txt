Much has been made of Wedding Crashers
� bid to reinvigorate the R-rated comedy, a genre that�s lain mostly dormant since There�s Something About Mary
. Wedding Crashers
 will no doubt make buckets of money, but it�ll do so without half the wit, compassion, or inspired madness of Mary
. Wilson and Vaughn play John Beckwith and Jeremy Klein, lifelong friends and partners in a D.C.-based divorce mediation firm. Given their profession, it�s no shock that they�re both a little leery of love. They choose instead to live in perpetual playboyland, and the wedding season is like Christmas in July for them. But all their rules are broken (and yes, they have a set of rules, some of them very funny) when they crash a high-profile politico wedding. John falls for the maid of honor, Claire Cleary (McAdams), while Jeremy falls into a Fatal Attraction
-like dalliance with Claire�s nutjob sister, Gloria (Fisher). The plot does backflips to get the two men stranded on the Cleary family�s Kennedy-esque island compound � just one in a string of needling logistical leaps. Kookiness ensues, but it�s mostly cookie-cutter stuff � Bob Fisher and Steve Faber�s script boasts old chestnuts like diarrhea, a salty gramma, and a hunting trip gone awry. Vaughn, in a role just once-removed from his breakout performance in Swingers
, most consistently brings the laughs with his frequent motor-mouth monologues that are a riot of sex jokes and non sequiturs (watch where he goes with maple syrup). But Wilson, playing straight man, is a dud, badly straddling the twin demands of his part: sleaze and sincerity. Sleaze mostly wins out. As for sincerity, it�s hard to take seriously an actor whose eyes are but half-slits most of the movie. Keep an eye on the eyes of all the men here � they�re a bloodshot bunch. It�s hard to blame them, really � a stiff drink or maybe some pharmaceutical assistance might have made me overlook the film�s sour tone, or the unremarkableness of its direction (helmer Dobkin shows none of the nuance of his underrated debut, Clay Pigeons
), or its bewildering characterizations of sexuality and race (gays and blacks are represented, respectively, by a squirrelly psychotic and a Jamaican house servant). I predict a long and fruitful future for Wedding Crashers
 � buckets of money � but by my count, it doesn�t just crash, it burns.


''Wedding Crashers," a salty and riotous new comedy, is the antidote to Hollywood's recent string of refried plots and allegorical disasters. Boldly, it embraces what too few big movies have this summer:
 fun. Some of you might recall how that feels: You enter the megaplex in anticipation, you leave in delight.
Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn star, respectively, as John Beckwith and Jeremy Klein, divorce mediators and untamed bachelors who spend their weekends combing the wedding circuit of the nation's capital, looking for women to bed. Their strategy was inherited some years ago from a great wedding-crashing guru. It consists of showing up at an event dashingly attired and prepared with a well-researched back story that loosely connects them to the bride or groom.
John and Jeremy might fake tears during the ceremony and get rip-roaring yet engagingly drunk at the reception, each zeroing in on the unsuspecting lass he cruised at the church. Amid all this, they charm fellow guests with inane toasts or, for the kids, balloon-animal tricks. Each man is shamelessly flattering in his own way, although John is smoother. During a slow dance, he tells one woman that the sweet nothing he just cooed to her is ''poetry -- by Sarah McLachlan."
Directed by David Dobkin from Steve Faber and Bob Fisher's script, ''Wedding Crashers" hits its stride in the first 20 minutes. The laughs come quick and easily. And after a blitz of weddings (Indian, Italian, Jewish), there's reason to worry that the movie's crack timing and deliberate comedic rhythms aren't meant to last.
Indeed, the movie seems to peak too soon in a rambunctious montage of reception and post-reception shenanigans edited by Mark Livolsi and backed by the Isley Brothers' ''Shout." Champagne explodes from a bottle, a girl takes a wholehearted swig, Wilson and Vaughn bounce up and down, girl collapses in ecstasy nude on a bed. Rinse and repeat.
As it happens, that's merely an energetic prelude. The movie's plot arrives with the nuptials of a senator's daughter, whose father is played by Christopher Walken and whose big day, Jeremy says, will be ''the Kentucky Derby of weddings." So away the boys crash, but not without complication. John falls fast for the senator's middle daughter Claire Cleary (Rachel McAdams), who's engaged to a macho WASP (Bradley Cooper). And Jeremy employs a fake-trauma trick called ''haunted past" to deflower the senator's manic youngest daughter, Gloria (Isla Fisher), who becomes wild and clingy with lust.
After his tryst, Jeremy wants to flee the premises. But John wants to pursue Claire, a flagrant violation of the 
wedding-crasher code. Nonetheless, when Claire, Gloria, and Senator Cleary invite John and Jeremy to weekend at their enormous Maryland estate, they comply. Sexual raunchiness follows. This includes Jane Seymour as Mrs. Robinson -- sorry, it's Mrs. Cleary
 -- who demands that John fondle her new breasts.
And yet, 
beneath the movie's freewheeling vulgarity, there's real heart and a tale of personal growth: John must win Claire from her fiance, not to conquer but to love her. Despite its inevitable outcome, the movie has a good time subverting what we've been trained to expect from the conclusion of a romantic comedy.
The ''Wedding Crashers" cast and crew never underestimate the art of simple entertainment. Dobkin is rather undistinguished as a moviemaker. (His previous film was ''Shanghai Knights," a draggy escapade with Wilson and Jackie Chan.) But here, he knows where to find the needles in the comedy haystack, even at the risk of some scenes crossing too far into farce, mostly where the Clearys' gay art-freak son is involved. (Although, honestly, he's no weirder than anyone else in the family.)
Dobkin also shows skill with the actors. Wilson and Vaughn are their usual selves, only more so. Wilson is typically unflappable, but he shows rare traces of actual feeling. And there's rock 'n' roll in Vaughn's rat-a-tat sarcasm. He and Wilson both look tired here, and the fatigue in their faces befits two men who need to slow down and grow up. They make a unique duo for comedy: There is no conventional straight man.
McAdams, with unflatteringly dark hair, is the calm in this rumpus. She provides a lovely reason for a man to forsake rakishness. But it's Fisher who makes the biggest impression. She looks like a teenage Ann-Margaret (she's 29) and is game for everything, fearlessly out-raunching her male co-stars. The character is just a nightmare fantasy, but it works because Fisher can find the fun-loving girl in the nutjob.
The movie has other virtues, too. At the Cleary's estate, ''Wedding Crashers" takes an unexpected turn into high-spirited, dirty-minded, physical restoration comedy. Here, the movie suggests what Billy Wilder might have tried with an R-rated ''Gatsby."
Of course, the movie's not as accomplished as a good Wilder picture, but what is? It's too long, too broad, and, at times, too slapdash. But even the hint of such an allusion 
is more pleasing than the string of movies currently aiming to satisfy our appetites for destruction. Tom Cruise might have saved his family from apocalypse. But Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn have just saved our summer. 


         "Wedding Crashers," one of this summer's few films not derived from a novel, a comic book, a TV show, another movie or a cheeseburger, stars Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn as John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, lifelong friends and partners in a divorce mediation firm. John and Jeremy spend their summers crashing strangers' nuptials in order to avail themselves of the open bars and heightened romantic recklessness of bridesmaids high on vows. But they're also in it for the grandparents, the kids and the cake. Because John and Jeremy may be damaged, manipulative, emotionally stunted frat boys with mouths like truckers, but they have a sentimental streak a mile wide.
 
  From the first scene of the movie, as screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher's raunchy, lunatic jokes begin to spill from the mouths of the protagonists in great, cheerful, Tourretic bursts, it's clear that "Wedding Crashers" hearkens to a simpler, more innocent time — a time before the movies were hijacked by family-friendly merchandisers and bully moralists. Witty, unhinged and fearless, it's exactly the kind of movie we need now; if only to give James Dobson something to get exercised about after a long day of focusing on the family.
 


         






    John and Jeremy's highly regimented system for infiltrating ceremonies requires them to carefully craft a customized wedding guest persona for each one — fake purple hearts, made-up dead war buddies, fictional charter memberships to the Oprah Book Club: Nothing that makes them more attractive in the moment and harder to track down later is taboo. The system works until one morning, when a girl whose name John has forgotten calls him on his high bovine-excrement-to-internal-organ ratio and makes him stop to think. Later, as the friends sit on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in a contemplative mood after a frenzied wedding-bedding montage, John wonders: "Do you think what we're doing is — I don't want to say 'sleazy,' because that's not the word — but irresponsible?"
 
  "Someday we'll look back on this and laugh," Jeremy assures him, "and say we were young and stupid." John considers for a second. "We're not that young."
 
  Still, John is persuaded to attend the final wedding of the season: the marriage of the oldest daughter of the secretary of the Treasury (Christopher Walken). It's "the Kentucky Derby of weddings," and at the reception, John meets and falls instantly in love with the bride's smart and pretty sister, Claire (Rachel McAdams), whom he's crushed to discover is going out with an entitled preppy named Sack Lodge (Bradley Cooper). Jeremy, meanwhile, is off having sex with another sister, the completely deranged and libidinous Gloria (Isla Fisher), who, after their furtive romp on the beach, announces that A) she was a virgin, and B) she's in love.In different, hammier hands, "Wedding Crashers" could have ended up coming across like a Neil LaBute sledgehammer to the knuckles. But nothing is cuter than Wilson and Vaughn together, tending to their friendship as though it were a hothouse orchid. Not bunnies. Not puppies. Not Will Ferrell, who officially wears out his screen welcome this summer in an ill-advised appearance toward the end of the movie. (The hyper-active bonehead routine — will it ever stop?)
 
  Hollywood has been systematically narrowing and blunting the definition of comedy for so long now, it seems nothing that is not a spastic, infantile retread qualifies anymore. Vaughn, in particular, has a sophisticated sense of humor and an emotional dark streak that wouldn't fit just anywhere; and director David Dobkin allows it to unfurl and deepen as the movie progresses. John is the more contemplative, self-possessed of the two friends, and Wilson brings his mellow-guy calm and equanimous humor to every scene he's in. But Jeremy is the soul of the movie. There's something about Vaughn — the deadpan eyes; the sublimated, misdirected intelligence — that recalls Bill Murray in his "Caddyshack" years.
 
  Within a couple of hours, John has broken all the rules — as set down by Chazz (Ferrell), a legendary 40-year-old who still lives with his mother — of wedding crashing by falling in love with Claire and accepting an invitation to spend a weekend at the Cleary's Chesapeake Bay estate. There they encounter the usual humiliations — a bigoted grandma, a phalanx of aggressive entitled frat boys, etc. — which they fight with charm, patience and a solid squirt of saline in the drinking water. John wistfully pursues the vague Claire, while Jeremy endures the affections of Gloria and her crazy artist brother, Todd (Keir O'Donnell.)
 
  There's a scene toward the middle of the movie in which John pushes Jeremy to the limit of his patience, and Jeremy threatens to leave the estate without him. Eventually Jeremy relents and agrees to stay and help John win Claire. But first, he announces, he's going to recover from the abuse by spending some quality time alone with his breakfast — a plate piled with waffles, muffins and whatever else is within reach, which he douses with maple syrup. Another comedian would have played this moment for gross-out laughs. Vaughn turns it into the most poignant scene in the movie. It makes you think, Vaughn is big and quick and smart. It's the comedies that got bloated, flabby and dumb.
 
  "Wedding Crashers" is far from bullet-proof, plot-wise (I kept fretting over the seating arrangements. Did they only crash buffets?) And it relies on some hackneyed conventions (the well-worn public declaration of love, for instance, otherwise known as the wedding interruptus scene.) But the performances are so spirited and weird — Fisher and O'Donnell are notably insane, in the best possible way) — and the movie so unapologetically fun, that it's easier to forgive it for losing steam toward the end. The awful Ferrell interlude is an unnecessary detour, a manic subplot wedged into the lazy, sultry, loose-limbed pace of the thing; and the love declaration of the climax is pure paint-by-bummers. But by then, the movie has delivered so many terrific jokes that it hardly matters.
 
  That's the thing about "Wedding Crashers": Underneath the diarrhea gags, the long lens at close range of Vaughn's pants and the handcuffs, it's really just a love story about a couple of buddies who live happily ever after. And it couldn't have happened to a nicer, more charming couple.

To call them breasts is to miss the point, and to call them tits is just...wrong. So I'll go with boobs to describe the naked anatomy on display, however briefly, in Wedding Crashers , an unabashedly jiggly, bawdy, it's-all-good comedy about a couple of guys who love getting laid. Bare boobs, flashed in good fun in an R-rated comedy without concern for children or politicians or morals police! Ha, not only have the terrorists not won, but the rights of an adult audience to laugh at good jokes about erections have been secured for another summer. Truly, it feels like a long hard time since moviegoers have tasted a piece of this pie, in which guys leer, girls giggle, and no one gets hurt or produces a firearm; it's been such a dry spell, in fact, that the retro, hetero, '70s-style raunch of Wedding Crashers  feels new again, modernized by the neo-retro-hetero duo of Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as champion skirt-chasers. In the scenario written by Steve Faber and Bob Fisher, directed by Shanghai Knights'  David Dobkin with relaxed understanding that on-screen chemistry is what happens between dialogue cues, best friends Jeremy (Vaughn) and John (Wilson) love the swordsman's life so much that the two have made a specialized after-hours career of wangling their way into strangers' weddings, the better to pick up chicks susceptible to the romance in the air and the champagne in their glasses.
The prologue of this funny, ungirdled romp  a buddy picture about buddies who actually know what women want (and worldly women who know what they want too)  is a montage of past nuptials. Here the boys relive a few of the triumphs at which they successfully united and conquered. A Jewish celebration, followed by Italian and Chinese and Irish wingdings  John and Jeremy know that the way to score in any culture is to look like it's the last thing on their minds, devoting themselves instead to entertaining the children, schmoozing with the oldies, and showing their vulnerable side to the ladies. Swingin', hors-d'oeuvres-stuffing, garrulous Vaughn makes expert use of his off-the-cuff, chow-it-down, guy-to-guy solidity and his ability to get the whole room dancing (he's the first one up for a good hora), while John's foolproof moves include twirling chastely with little flower girls (Wilson a vision of frosted hair and smarmily sincere gestures) in a way sure to be noticed by nearby compassionate bridesmaids.
The two meet their matches, as they must; every horndog has his day. Crashing the haute Washington, D.C., festivities for a daughter of the U.S. secretary of the treasury (Christopher Walken, the go-to man to play crackpot fathers when Robert De Niro is busy), John falls for one of the bride's two sisters (Rachel McAdams) while Jeremy is waylaid by the other (Isla Fisher). And the movie becomes a comedy of mixed intentions, culminating in a goofy cameo appearance by a comedian famous for his old-school impersonations, as the long-in-the-tooth swinger who taught Jeremy and John all the intricacies of wedding crashing in the first place.
What the boys learn, of course, is that for mature men, the mating game's more fun with a partner one cares about the next day. What we learn is that the pairing of Vaughn and Wilson is a success to do a matchmaker proud.

 What's old is new again, kind of, in the amiably raunchy sex comedy "Wedding Crashers." A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, the film pivots on two cut-rate Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn, who love the ladies, but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. The latest chapter in the endless movie epic about childish men and the women who mother them, this film basically presents an R-rated riff on the usual Mutt and Jeff, Hope and Crosby pairings, "The Road to Bootytown" for Maxim page-flippers.  Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher, and directed by David Dobkin, the film trumpets an amusingly tasteless premise: Mr. Wilson and Mr. Vaughn play John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, Washington divorce mediators, who ritually embark on the smooth operator's version of big-game hunting. Armed with elaborate back stories (they masquerade as fabulous successes) and equally baroque rules, the two attend the nuptials of complete strangers specifically to pick up women, the idea being that tears and booze will have critically weakened such quarries' defenses. The movie takes off at the opening of the new wedding season,  with the guys revving up for 17 ceremonies and potentially twice the number of boudoir kills.  The two stars do much of the heavy lifting in the film, with Mr. Wilson, as expected, best in show. With his easy manner and deceptively lazy drawl, he has carved out a singular movie niche as our reigning dude, the quintessential American guy who, whether ensconced in Texas or Manhattan, never lets anything (including whacks on the schnoz) take him out of his groove. That easygoing vibe makes Mr. Wilson extremely likable and it also obscures his flexibility; as an actor, he's both comfortable in high-concept bagatelles like "Zoolander" and high-art gems like "The Royal Tenenbaums," which he helped write and in which he plays a Cormac McCarthy-style author who waxes about "the friscalating dusklight."  Mr. Vaughn labors twice as hard as his co-star, and it's the strain of that effort, the sights and sounds of his motor-mouth furiously whirring, that makes the character work. "Wedding Crashers" is, after all, meant to be a lighthearted comedy about men who, at least at first, see women only as prey. For that conceit to fly, John and Jeremy have to be played by actors who seem not only naturally appealing, but also harmless. That may explain why Mr. Vaughn, who has convincingly played killers in Gus Van Sant's remake of "Psycho" and in Mr. Dobkin's obnoxious first movie, "Clay Pigeons," looks covered in flop sweat even when he appears bone dry. For him, nice isn't easy.  Nominally more high-minded than "Porky's" and many of the sex comedies to follow in that film's  crude wake ("American Pie," "Old School"), "Wedding Crashers" belongs to a familiar class of movie in which men [sic] are allowed to have their cake and eat it too. These movies revolve around a sensitive alpha guy and his faithful sidekicks, all of whom are pigs but really nice pigs. In the first act, the guys swap locker-room jokes and hustle anything without a penis while making the requisite gay-panic jokes along the way. In the second act, the sensitive alpha meets a woman whose brain seems bigger than her breasts or at least more interesting. They hook up, he blows it,  and she splits, only to return for the ostensibly happy ending.  That's what more or less happens in "Wedding Crashers," which is reasonably enjoyable until its guys are forced to grow up. Because bad behavior is usually more fun to watch than good, the movie is especially fine during the preliminaries. With their lies neatly tucked away, the conspirators hit churches, synagogues and other houses of worship. John deploys eyedrops to simulate weeping during one ceremony; Jeremy twists balloons into shapes at a reception so it looks as if he's good with kids. Finally, in an orgiastic sequence set to the song "Shout" that grows progressively faster and funnier, the pair party with and then bed a succession of women amid a flurry of edits, a bacchanal that reaches a crescendo with the image of the two men gleefully popping bottles of Champagne.  It's crude, yes, but also funny; too bad these lost boys can't stay lost. Although Rachel McAdams, as John's inevitable love interest, and Isla Fisher, as Jeremy's, are watchable in their different ways, the film predictably starts to lose its fizz when they enter the picture. Ms. McAdams, who grows more appealing with every new role, makes the most of her underdeveloped character, Claire, the goody-two-shoes daughter of a powerful politician (Christopher Walken, doing his usual weird thing, but doing it well). As her considerably naughtier sister, Gloria, Ms. Fisher brings some serious Rick James-style freakiness to a supporting role that might otherwise barely register. She even manages to steal scenes from Mr. Vaughn, an inveterate scene-stealer.  Like clockwork, the film soon mutates from a guy-oriented sex comedy into a wish-fulfillment chick flick. Love blooms and almost withers after the sisters take John and Jeremy to their family estate, where men wear colors rarely seen outside of a restricted country club. Something happens, something else happens, but before the filmmakers tie everything up with a bow, they throw in a surprisingly resonant scene in which Claire's fiancé, Sack, wallops John. The beating, however, seems like a pretext for the smirking remark Sack makes about a waitress as he enters his own engagement party. For him, the only difference between a woman he lusts after and a woman he marries is that he calls one his wife. Crude? Yes. Funny? Well, that's up to you.  "Wedding Crashers" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It is promiscuously ribald and features an assortment of impressively endowed, partially clothed women.

While neither a full-throated R-rated romp a la "There's Something About Mary" nor a fully realized romantic comedy, "Wedding Crashers" contains enough appealing elements of both to catch the bouquet in what's been a relatively humor-deprived summer. Pic starts slowly, peaks in the middle and can't quite sustain that energy through to the satisfying finish, but there are enough laugh-out-loud moments for New Line to toast to healthy traffic down the aisles.
A too-long montage (one of a few) introduces John (Owen Wilson) and Jeremy (Vince Vaughn), two divorce arbitrators who have mastered the art of crashing weddings, an event that causes female attendees to "throw their inhibitions to the wind." Their well-practiced routine is full of carefully plotted approaches -- from dancing with the flower girl to expressing their fondness for Oprah's book club -- for capturing women's vulnerable hearts just long enough to entice them into bed.
That's all a prelude, however, to the main event: The wedding of the daughter to a well-connected Washington politico, Secretary Cleary (Christopher Walken, at about two-thirds speed), where John gets struck by the proverbial thunderbolt upon seeing the good secretary's other daughter, Claire ("The Notebook's" Rachel McAdams).
Jeremy, meanwhile, seduces a third daughter, Cleary (Isla Fisher), though the love-'em-and-skedaddle act gets thrown for a loop when John accepts a weekend invitation to the Kennedy-esque clan's vacation home, hoping to extend his chances of wooing Claire away from her pugnacious boyfriend (Bradley Cooper).
What proceeds is fairly amusing, fitfully over the top and -- in a series of gags about the Cleary girls' creepy brother (Keir O'Donnell) -- occasionally a touch homophobic. Most of the gags are drawn from the playbook of rich folks' eccentricities, from the foul-mouthed grandmother to the horny matriarch (Jane Seymour) who takes a "The Graduate"-like pass at seducing John.
Jeremy, meanwhile, endures an increasingly bizarre array of indignities, from a full-contact game of touch football to a memorable under-the-table dinner sequence that takes "Goodbye, Columbus" up a couple of notches.
Director David Dobkin and writers Steve Faber and Bob Fisher have the wedding trappings and psychology of the ceremonial seduction down pat, but they're on less assured footing in selling the John-Claire romance. Fortunately, McAdams is such a beguiling presence she helps fill in narrative gaps and actually creates a real character -- a rarity for females in one of these lad-mag escapades.
While Wilson spends much of his time pining, Vaughn's rapid-fire dialogue yields most of the comedic highlights, from labeling a woman a "Stage 5 clinger" to his hushed reverence toward the fellow who originated the wedding crasher's art, leading to the inevitable (and after the first glimpse, pretty ho-hum) celebrity cameo.
Walken has too little to do as the powerful-but-doting dad, while Cooper's boyfriend is such a sneering cartoon it's a little too easy to root for Claire to dump him. And while it's mentioned more than once that Wilson and Vaughn aren't that
 young, they probably are a tad old for this brand of shenanigans, especially since they conveniently encounter so few husbands and boyfriends as obstacles.
Yet even with those minor gripes -- and the larger one that the movie, like many a wedding, drags on a bit too long -- it's mostly an agreeable ride, with a deftly assembled soundtrack and even a rather sappy message about true love underlying it all.
Indeed, "Wedding Crashers'" real secret is that despite flashes of nudity, crudity and mockery of women's raging hormones at the first sight of a trousseau, at its core it's just a big pushover with the heart of a chick flick.

Hollywood  number crunchers estimate that by 2008, one-quarter of all studio comedies will feature a permutation of the acting collective popularly dubbed the Frat Pack, who have risen to dominance in the last few years: Zoolander  (2001): Stiller, O. Wilson, Ferrell; The Royal Tenenbaums  (2001): Stiller, O. Wilson, L. Wilson; Old School  (2003): Ferrell, Vaughn, L. Wilson; Starsky & Hutch  (2004): Stiller, O. Wilson, Vaughn, Ferrell; Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story  (2004): Stiller, Vaughn; Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy   (2004): Ferrell, Stiller, Vaughn, L. Wilson; Meet the Fockers  (2004): Stiller, O. Wilson; Wedding Crashers  (2005): Vaughn, O. Wilson, [name redacted].
Know your Frat Pack! Ben Stiller  is the tightly coiled workaholic, pecs and brain muscles rippling in rhythm; he's both the Idea Man and the Body. Will Ferrell  is the galvanizing force of nature, macho-suave yet thrumming with reserves of sugar-smacked hysteria, hairy of chest and manner yet unafraid to cry like a girl or scream like a woman. Luke Wilson  is the puppyish boy next door, useful as straight man, cuckold, corruptible innocent, or all-around pathos provider. Luke's brother Owen is, immortally, the Butterscotch Stallion  (a superhero designation bestowed by gossip website Defamer ), dazed yet pensive, a golden halation of cannabinoid vibeology, surfer orbs glazing into the distance in eternal search of that perfect wave. And Vaughn, something of a utility player, is either the phlegmatic layabout or, more often, the sardonic motormouth, the poker of ribs, the shit stirrer.
He stirs plenty in Wedding Crashers , in which John (O. Wilson) and Jeremy (Vaughn) are dating cynics who spend each matrimonial high season infiltrating receptions in search of no-strings booty, their passage lubricated by a pair of counterfeit Purple Hearts and the allegedly aphrodisiac effects of the wedding rites upon the unmarried female species. Given this premise, perhaps it goes without saying that the Fratsters would behoove themselves to invite a few girls to their clubhouse, which at this point is rank with recirculated air. A punishingly distended reception montage scored to "Shout" assumes inherent humor in watching Wilson and Vaughn crack themselves up, especially if Vaughn has a thick wad of cake in his mouth.
As in Old School , the overgrown adolescents develop a self-invented, rather Masonic inventory of rituals and rules, several of which are apparently broken at "the greatest crash of all time," where the father of the bride is Secretary of the Treasury William Cleary  (bored Christopher Walken ). Jeremy marks youngest Cleary daughter Gloria (Isla Fisher ), pops her cherry on a beach, andmission accomplishedwants to skedaddle. But John is so smitten with maid of honor middle daughter Claire (alpha Mean Girl Rachel McAdams ) that he follows her back to the family compound, where Jeremy is soon besieged by light-bondage enthusiast Gloria and her scowling gay brother (Keir O'Donnell ).
Wedding Crashers  arranges for two stunted louts to come of age 20 years behind schedule, though the fairer sex as envisioned here would seem to hold no allure for the commitment-phobe. The movie drags out by the hair the oversexed, underserviced wifey (Jane Seymour ) and the sweet, little bigoted grandma (Ellen Albertini Dow), Gloria is a deranged brat, and Claire flirts plaintively with John without disclosing the existence of her blueblood-sociopath beau (Bradley Cooper ). Wilson is as blandly charming and recessive as in The Life Aquatic ; with drunk-auctioneer delivery of lines like "The proper girl in the hat just eye-fucked the shit out of me," the perpetually riled Vaughn can generate a modicum of goodwill, one immediately negated by lines like "I felt like Jodie Foster  in The Accused  last night." Amiable and hollow, Wedding Crashers  is briefly enlivened by the final-act appearance of a Frat Pack axiom, given a shadowy star entrance in a blood-red dressing gown and redolent of a seedier, funnier party happening somewhere else.
