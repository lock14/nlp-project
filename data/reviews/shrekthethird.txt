Shrek
, DreamWorks' big, green cash machine, has finally run dry, perhaps not of box-office power, but most assuredly of the caustic, fractured fairy tale-isms and the wry, snarky wit that made the first film, and to a lesser degree, the first sequel, so winning. Shrek the Third
 begins with the death of the Frog King of Far, Far Away (Cleese in a too-brief cameo), an ill-omen for the ogre Shrek (Myers), who not only has to contend with the unpalatable notion of suddenly becoming a royal (you get the idea that Shrek's politics are Labour through and through) but also with the strain of impending � and apparently unplanned � fatherhood. As soon as his beloved Princess Fiona (Diaz) announces the proverbial mucous-green bun in the oven, Shrek ships off in search of Fiona's cousin Artie (Timberlake), with an eye toward solving his pressing peerage problems. In his absence, the vapid Prince Charming (Everett), previously jilted by Fiona and now reduced to doing dinner theatre, stages a palace coup with the assistance of fairy tales' greatest villains, chief among them Captain Hook, the Evil Queen, and Rumpelstiltskin. Chaos ensues, though not amusingly so. Shrek the Third
 is a colossally unsatisfying mess of a movie, with at least one too many storylines for its own good and barely a belly laugh in sight. At the packed preview I attended, there were more temper tantrums than giggles emanating from the peanut gallery and a sort of grudging acceptance of the concept of film-franchise entropy from Mom and Dad. Murphy's wisecracking donkey is simply an ass here, and Banderas' swashbuckling Puss in Boots, the highlight of Shrek 2
, is barely used here at all. Given the choice between sitting through yet another tot-mandated home viewing of Madagascar
 or Ice Age
 (or even, dare I suggest it, any of Walt Disney's classic animated features), parents will be better off firing up the DVD player and steering well clear of this plodding, unfunny disappointment.


When the names of the stars doing the voices for "Shrek the Third" appear merrily at the end, some cheer is in order. Mike Myers as Shrek , Eddie Murphy as Donkey, Antonio Banderas as Puss in Boots: They're good and hammy at what they do. But obviously the real stars are the hundreds of artists and technicians who get this story told with so much visual accuracy and wit. People like Guillaume Aretos, who oversaw the production design; Tim Cheung, who headed the character animation; and all the folks they worked with.
Never mind that their names might not mean as much to an audience as those of super-exes Cameron Diaz (she does Princess Fiona's voice) and Justin Timberlake (he joins the cast as a young King Arthur). The movie wouldn't be nearly as enjoyable without the participation of the way-below-the-title names. In-jokes and jabs at the bland conventions of classic and recent Disney animation are this series' stock in trade, but physical and facial realism are the biggest achievements in DreamWorks's fractured fairy tales.
This new one finds its big green ogre not interested at all in royal life or fatherhood. When Fiona tells Shrek she's pregnant, he has a terrific, grotesque nightmare in which he's attacked by millions of Shrek babies. He'd rather be back in his shabby hut. But after froggy King Harold (John Cleese) falls ill, Shrek temporarily takes on official royal duties. In a magnificently prolonged deathbed sequence, he leaves his crown to Shrek. He doesn't want it, though, forcing the poor old frog to come up with a plan B before he croaks. It's a teenager named Arthur, whom Shrek, Donkey, and Puss hit the road to fetch.
The journey is not very exciting, but the destinations are inspired. Arthur -- or Artie, as he prefers -- attends a medieval school that's like a combination of Hogwarts and Ridgemont High. And at some point a crusty Merlin (Eric Idle) shows up and does some magic that has amusing consequences for Donkey and Puss.
Meanwhile, Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), still smarting that Shrek married his girl, has convinced a mob of defeated storybook villains (Captain Hook, the Evil Queen, etc.) that they should avenge themselves. So they nastily descend upon the Far Far Away kingdom, which apparently is located on the Paramount Studios lot. Fiona and the queen (Julie Andrews) are swiftly locked up, along with Snow White (Amy Poehler), Sleeping Beauty (Cheri Oteri), and Cinderella (Amy Sedaris), Fiona's more typical storybook counterparts, who've been reimagined as ungrateful yuppie snobs. Charming's terrorism culminates in the mounting of a musical production that demonstrates what Andrew Lloyd Webber might do with a Disney version of Rapunzel.
Needless to say, the overall surprise of the original "Shrek," which was based on William Steig's beautifully told and drawn book, can't be recaptured. The movie was a wholesale rejection of glossy cartoon cheer and the general Disneyification of fairy tales, and, seemingly, came from nowhere. Its weave of barbed pop-culture jokes and emotional sincerity had been available on "The Simpsons" for years, but "Shrek" made it seem workable at the movies. The second installment, "Shrek 2," unbraided the gags from the feeling, tipping the balance to gleeful cynicism, which, while fun to watch, was discomforting. It seemed to come to the filmmakers much more easily than the story's emotional dimensions.
With "Shrek the Third ," the series still favors the jokes -- Led Zeppelin , Heart, and Wings songs are put to amusing use. But director Chris Miller and the credited writers (there are four) are determined that if these films are to be a collection of riffs and gags, with a sweet afterthought for a finale, then they ought to be very good. And, largely, these are.
Of course, many of them come at the expense of the title star. The movie is stolen from him by everyone from Murphy's jackass and Banderas's kitty cat to Pinocchio (Cody Cameron) and the Gingerbread Man (Conrad Vernon), who might be this series's funniest creation. Because of Shrek's ubiquity as a marketing force, he seems overly familiar, as do his parenting and self-esteem woes. But his yielding the stage is an act of generosity that allows you to savor the smaller things. So while there is some pleasure in Shrek's life struggles, it's the sight and sound of a dying frog that I won't soon forget.


A happy home life for a couple who have overcome great obstacles may be heaven for actual human beings, but it's hell on comedy. What's interesting about a husband and wife who love one another, live in comfort, and get on well with the in-laws  even if the husband is fat, green, and uncouth and the wife is an ogre by conversion? Not much  a fact of middle-class life Shrek the Third  accepts with middle-aged practicality. This latest extension of Shrek  the brand doesn't try harder. There's nothing bigger, longer, or uncut about the production, no straining for pop-cultural meta-comedy relevance; and no showstopping to match Eddie Murphy's motormouthed Donkey from the 2001 original or Antonio Banderas' cosmopolitan swordsman, Puss in Boots, three years ago in Shrek 2 . But that modesty of goal, executed with efficiency and a few new supporting-character flourishes, turns out to be the movie's small saving grace: Shrek the Third  sticks to the swamp it knows best, in a mild climate of palatable jokes about fatherhood, high school, girl power, and a drug-education program for teens that advises ''Just Say Nay.''
I realize that in hotter weather I might fault the movie  directed by DreamWorks story artist Chris Miller in his feature debut, it's one of the summer's big-budget, franchise threequels  for its lack of ambition. But something in the polished reliability of the machinery appeals to me as an antidote to Spider-Man 3 -type overstimulation. (The litany of overmarketed product tie-ins is a different story.)
Plus, I love the princess squad, about whom, more in a moment.
When day breaks this time over the kingdom of Far Far Away, Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers again) has been performing royal ceremonial duties, gamely if clumsily substituting for a dying King Harold (John Cleese), his amphibian father-in-law by marriage to Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). Really, Shrek isn't keen on the running-a-kingdom gig. Like our own stubbornly folksy head of state, he's not a grown-up comfortable with the niceties of formality. All he'd like to do is get back to his swampy equivalent of a ranch in Crawford, Tex., and surround himself with vermin. Fiona consoles, but she's got news of her own as old-fashioned as anything Lucy Ricardo might delicately break to Ricky on I Love Lucy : She's pregnant.
What a whammy for a guy, huh? The only way Shrek can hand over the royal portfolio he has inherited is to seek out the only other possible heir to the throne and pass the unwanted crown to him   even if the candidate, Fiona's distant cousin Arthur Pendragon (Justin Timberlake), is currently a gangly, picked-on high school kid who calls himself Artie. And the only way Shrek can come to terms with fatherhood is  well, of course he's going to embrace fatherhood and love his wife and yada yada as countless men and ogres in family movies have done before him, but still, he's appropriately scared. Meanwhile, far, far away from Far Far Away, thwarted, bubbleheaded pretty boy Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) schemes a return to retake the kingdom he feels rightfully should be his by enlisting a posse of fairy-tale losers  among them Ian McShane's Captain Hook  as his coalition of the sort-of-willing.
These hero's-quest parameters established, Shrek the Third  moves smoothly from act to act. At Artie's Worcestershire Academy, a cultural mash of Harry Potter's Hogwarts and the academic groves of Beverly Hills, 90210 , Shrek and his travel mates Donkey and Puss in Boots first confuse Artie with Lancelot (The Office 's John Krasinski), so strapping and alpha-boy jock-hearty is the latter and so coltish the former, even with Timberlake's energetic charm in evidence. (As Merlin, an unreliable professor of magic whose incantations are a bit rusty, Eric Idle doubles the quotient of Monty Python alumni.) Meanwhile, a palace assault by Prince Charming's forces of evil during Fiona's baby shower binds hostess and royal female guests in unanticipated kick-ass sisterhood.
Considering that competitive divas Snow White (Amy Poehler), Sleeping Beauty (Cheri Oteri), Cinderella (Amy Sedaris), and Rapunzel (Maya Rudolph) don't have much use for one another, their transformation into Shrek's Angels (along with a fabulously resourceful Fiona and her admirable mother, voiced by Julie Andrews) becomes the movie's One Cool Thing. In a square tale of facing male adulthood, this little, spiky feminist SNL  sketch is one for the girls.

 For all I know, there may be an endless supply of “Shrek” sequels in the pipeline.  That DreamWorks ogre’s skin is the color of money after all. But there is nonetheless a feeling of finality about “Shrek the Third,” a sense that the tale has at last reached a state of completion. In the first movie Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) met and wooed his lady love, Fiona (Cameron Diaz); in the second he got to know the in-laws. The current installment finds him faced with impending fatherhood and something of a career crisis. Will he take over his father-in-law’s business or remain true to his vocation of bellowing and smashing things?  Unless the Shrek team wants to follow its hero into the dangerous swamps of mid-life, thus shifting his literary pedigree away from William Steig and in the direction of John Updike or Philip Roth, it  may want to leave him in a condition of more-or-less happily ever after. Which is only to say that “Shrek the Third,” directed by Chris Miller and Raman Hui from a script with a half-dozen credited begetters, already feels less like a children’s movie than either of its predecessors. (This may be why I liked it better than the others. But then again, so did my kids.)  It isn’t that there’s anything inappropriate — no smoking or swearing and only the sex implied by Fiona’s pregnancy and the brood of Donkey-Dragon offspring — but rather that the movie’s liveliest humor and sharpest drama take root in decidedly grown-up situations. Shrek’s anxious, less-than-overjoyed reaction to the prospect of becoming a parent is not something most youngsters will relate to. (In one brilliantly executed sequence he has a nightmare of being besieged by hundreds of gurgling, saucer-eyed ogre babies.) And the depiction of Cinderella (Amy Sedaris), Rapunzel (Maya Rudolph) and Snow White (Amy Poehler) as bored, catty moms is likely to tickle fans of “Little Children,” a group that I hope doesn’t include any actual little children.  Whether these bits would seem as fresh or incisive if they were not embedded in a noisy cartoon remotely based on a beloved picture book is an open question. The strategy of the “Shrek” movies has always been to appeal to the easy, smirky cynicism of the parents while whetting their children’s appetite for crude humor and plush merchandise. “Shrek 2” pulled off the trick in a way that struck me as coarse and overdone, turning travestied fairy tales into the stuff of hackneyed Hollywood satire. But “Shrek the Third” seems at once more energetic and more relaxed, less desperate to prove its cleverness and therefore to some extent smarter.  It helps that the animation looks better than ever. Practice, along with advances in technology, has made the faces of the characters more expressive and their movements more graceful. The drawn-out death of Fiona’s father, a royal frog voiced by John Cleese, is a minor tour de force of pathos and slapstick, and there are some angry trees that do justice to the venerable cinematic tradition of angry trees. Another high point is when Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) gets wet.  As for plot, there are several, and also the usual complement of celebrity voices and peppy pop songs. The death of the king leaves Shrek as the reluctant heir to the throne, and the ogre sails off to find a replacement in the person of Artie, a prep-school bully magnet with the voice of Justin Timberlake. Meanwhile the disgraced Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), exiled to a career in dinner theater, organizes a rebellion of fairy-tale villains. Eric Idle plays Merlin as a hippy druid, and Larry King and Regis Philbin do fine work as ugly stepsisters. And of course Eddie Murphy is the indispensable Donkey.  If I sound a bit disenchanted, that may be because disenchantment has been the point of the “Shrek” movies all along. Expressing a sometimes explicit animus against the Disney versions of well-known European folk tales, the franchise set out from the start to scramble the traditional polarities of good and evil, setting itself up as a more sophisticated, knowing brand of pop-culture magic. But those old stories — and those classic Disney movies — were almost more complicated than the parodies allowed. Their eerie subtexts and haunting ambiguities have always been more crucial to their power and appeal than the overt lessons they teach.  “Shrek,” “Shrek 2” and “Shrek the Third,” by contrast, are flat and simple, hectic and amusing without being especially thrilling or complex. Their naughty insouciance makes their inevitable lapses into sentimental moralism all the more glaring. In this movie we hear some speeches about how it’s important not to care about what other people think of you, and to be yourself above all. Yeah, fine, whatever. This doesn’t strike me as necessarily good advice, and in any case today’s wised-up kids don’t need life lessons from an ogre. But then again, the kids are not the ones who identify with Shrek as he makes his grouchy way through the life cycle.  “Shrek the Third” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has crude humor and cartoon rough-housing.

The "Shrek" industry continues to expand beyond the feature films themselves. The short "Shrek 4-D" bridged the gap between the first two pictures, a "Shrek the Halls" holiday TV spec looms later this year, and "Shrek: The Musical" will head for Broadway next season.
Shrek and his bride Fiona prove similarly fertile in the new outing. With the death -- in a hilariously protracted scene -- of the Frog King (voiced by John Cleese), the crown of Far Far Away is Shrek's to refuse, and refuse it he must, given the oafishness with which he performs the most menial royal functions. "I am an ogre. I'm not cut out for this," he complains to his wife, unaware she's got a wee one growing in her belly.
Pic peaks with a resultant fatherhood nightmare in which panicked Shrek is engulfed in a flood of demanding ogre tykes from whom there can be no escape. But before he is forced to cope with fatherhood, Shrek must tend to the business of finding a replacement for himself on the throne.
Prime suspect in this line is Artie (Justin Timberlake), Fiona's half-brother, who lives in another land far far away reached by Shrek, Donkey and Puss in Boots after a lengthy sea voyage. Although the region is called Worcestershire, it bears more than a passing resemblance to the OC, given the American-accented layabouts who lard their speech with "like" and "whatever." What may have been the filmmakers' idea of an amusing gag in fact comes off as pandering to young Yank viewers.
Artie is a good-looking but dweeby outcast, the butt of fun for rival Lancelot's crew, and dismissive of Shrek's entreaties even as they travel together toward Far Far Away. Film itself is becalmed when their ship runs aground and the action is briefly dominated by a broken-down, New Agey Merlin (Eric Idle) whose magical powers aren't what they once were.
Providing more fun is Prince Charming (Rupert Everett), who, after a failed career in dinner theater, convinces a tavern full of villains (Captain Hook, Cyclops, et al.) to join him in conquering Far Far Away and enjoy their own happy ending for once. Ultimately opposing them is a band of heretofore sweet young things (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and Rapunzel among them), who take matters into their own hands while Shrek, Artie and Fiona are sorting out their futures.
Having moved on to "The Chronicles of Narnia" franchise, Andrew Adamson, director of the first two "Shrek" entries, has handed the reins to Chris Miller, who worked as a story artist and provided vocals on the earlier installments. From a visual and storytelling p.o.v., transition is seamless. Notable details this time include the attention to facial and physical nuance in Shrek's characterization, and the evident delight Miller and the artists have taken in the design and minutiae of the stage productions rendered in the opening and closing sequences.
Franchise stars Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy and Antonio Banderas continue their stellar voice work, and the latter two have some choice moments in the late going thanks to a clever gag involving the Donkey and Puss in Boots characters. Musical elements are bright as usual.

Our stinky ogre grows flabbier by the sequel, and this time around we find him reeling from the death of his froggy father-in-law and the prospect of running the kingdom of Far Far Away in his stead. What to do in the face of such crisis but take to the road with Donkey and Puss In Boots while shoehorning in a new character (voiced by Justin Timberlake ) designed to drag the middle-school demographic away from its iPods  and into the multiplex? Bolstered by fart jokes, mass- marketing, and the usual flood of tie-ins, Shrek  the Third  will surely take in its usual bundle at the box office, but that doesn't make the movie a success. Blinded by avarice and all out of ideas, once again, Hollywood  can't tell when enough is way more than enough.
