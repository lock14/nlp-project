Intelligence is insulted at every turn in this new date movie from former "swingers" Vaughn and Favreau, who now write themselves roles as middle-aged men grown flabby in both body and spirit. Joining these co-stars and co-writers in this affront to moviegoers is screenwriter Dana Fox (who scripted What Happens in Vegas
, another love-found-out-of-town story) and actor/producer and, now, director Billingsley (who will probably remain best known as Ralphie, the kid who sorely wants a BB gun in the beloved A Christmas Story
). Vaughn also produces and, as the film's top-lined star, plays the only happily married man in this story's quartet of couples who are induced to go on a weeklong couples retreat in support of their pals Jason (Bateman) and Cynthia (Bell), whose failed attempts to procreate have driven their marriage to a state of near-divorce. Four couples are needed in order to obtain the more affordable Pelican Package rate, but Jason and Cynthia's carefully prepared PowerPoint presentation assures the others that they will not have to partake in the resort's couples-therapy sessions. The group � including Shane (Love), the divorced man who is shown in his introductory scene as not even having enough money to qualify for a loan to buy a motorcycle � takes off the very next week for the exotic locale. Of course, nothing goes as planned as everyone is forced into therapy, where the psychobabble eats away at the various marriages (especially the one happy union) and a "couples whisperer" by the name of Monsieur Marcel (Reno in an embarrassing mankini) conducts pointless daily exercises. Several random sequences follow in succession: a badly choreographed shark attack, a massage that requires a self-serve happy ending, ridiculous therapy sessions, a Fabio look-alike yoga instructor (Ponce) who provides the requisite homophobic sight gags, and a renegade excursion to the singles' side of the resort where, magically, everything resolves. Even Shane's ex-wife suddenly materializes. Logic and credibility are defied at almost every opportunity. Even so, some of this might have worked if the script was, say, funny. Couples Retreat
 was edited down from an R to a PG-13 rating prior to release, though I doubt we'll discover any excised gems once the director's cut comes out on DVD. Yes, there is scenery that looks good enough to be a screensaver, as one of the characters exclaims, and of course, the background offers an endless array of scantily clad hardbodies. But before booking a ticket, I urge you to retreat.

Husbands and wives of America: It’s Friday night and you’ve hired a baby sitter. The early-bird restaurant meal has been consumed; the multiplex beckons. Surely you want to see a frisky, fun-filled comedy about married couples arguing bitterly over the attention they’re not giving each other, the resentments they’re storing up, the sex they’re not having. No? Better beat a retreat from “Couples Retreat,’’ a movie for people who prefer to get their relationship advice from rich Hollywood stars.
The movie is co-written by Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau, whose breakthrough movie, “Swingers,’’ was 13 years ago and feels it. Vaughn plays Dave, married to Ronnie (Malin Akerman) with two overly precocious Hollywood tykes (Gattlin Griffith, Colin Baiocchi) and no downtime. Favreau is Joey, stuck in mutual loathing with wife Lucy (Kristin Davis). Their big-bubba friend Shane (Faizon Love) is divorced and dating a 20-year-old mall clerk (Kali Hawk). Fourth wheel Jason (Jason Bateman) is a type-A twit who can’t conceive a child with equally tense Cynthia (Kristen Bell).
Are we having fun yet?
Yes, there’s pointed human comedy to be mined from the very real stresses of married life, but this bonehead idiots-in- paradise farce raises issues only to gloss them over. The four couples sign up for a Caribbean island getaway that turns out to be a relationship boot camp run by a touchy-feely Euro-guru (Jean Reno in a pigtail) and his metrosexual minions.
In other words, “Couples Retreat’’ pokes fun at fairly reasonable therapy-speak by putting it in the mouths of effeminate foreigners. Then it lets the heroes discover those same truths via Applebees metaphors and prominently displayed cases of Bud. Why isn’t Tim Allen in this movie?
There are some chuckles. Bateman’s habit of turning every aspect of his life into a PowerPoint presentation is funny and some of Vaughn’s and Favreau’s lines have a good rude snap. Otherwise, if the thought of a little boy pooping in a showroom toilet fills you with joy, here’s your movie. The bit where Vaughn is encircled by sharks might have worked if the sharks weren’t obviously digitally added later. Everything about “Couples Retreat’’ feels plastic, though: the jokes, the trees, the extras, the attitudes. It’s dumbed-down entertainment aimed at a dumbed-down audience  - the comedy equivalent of a McMansion.
By the way, how can you tell this was written, produced, and directed by guys? All the husbands have SWUB (soft white underbellies) and all the wives are hotties. A bigger problem is that none of the characters is remotely likable. The first-time director is Peter Billingsley, Vaughn’s producing partner and a former child actor best known as Ralphie in 1983’s “A Christmas Story.’’ He doesn’t put an eye out here but he comes damn close.

As the buddies of Swingers  (1996), the classic L.A.-set guyville comedy that put the two of them on the map, Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau had a new kind of snappishly disaffected camaraderie. They were friends who each acted like a spiky entourage of one; their bond  figuring out how to impress a girl by pretending not to care about her  was built around bolstering each other's egos by getting in each other's faces. Swingers , which Favreau wrote, came out   13 years ago, but once you've seen Couples Retreat , the mediocre, funnier-at-times-than-you-expect, more-middle-class-stodgy-than-it-should-have-been new comedy about four couples (most of them old friends) who attempt to heal their relationships at a New Age therapeutic resort, it feels as if it came out about 113 years ago.
Vaughn and Favreau are still getting in each other's faces, but what a difference a   decade makes. We've all heard of failing upward; with Couples Retreat , Vaughn and Favreau seem to be succeeding downward. Written by both of them (along with Dana Fox), and directed by Peter Billingsley, it's one of those comedies in which each couple comes with its own cute tics and tidy conflicts  like, say,   Jason and Cynthia (Jason Bateman and Kristen Bell), who are fraying each other's nerves because they can't conceive a child (they also fray the nerves of the audience by explaining their lives as a PowerPoint presentation). Or Shane (Faizon Love), the roly-poly divorced dude who brings along his high -lariously   inappropriate paramour, 20-year-old party girl Trudy (Kali Hawk), who likes to call him ''Daddy'' from across crowded rooms.
As for Vaughn and Favreau, they're the beleaguered, hanging-in-there marital vets. Vaughn's Dave is a relatively centered father who, despite being chained to his job as a videogame salesman, would do well to stop brushing off the minor requests of his wife, Ronnie (Malin Akerman, as a miraculously radiant overworked mother of two). Favreau's Joey is an angry lug trapped in a union of toxic insincerity with Lucy (Kristin Davis), who knows how to give as bad as she gets.
Kicking off their package-deal vacation, which they've all been roped into out of solidarity with Jason and Cynthia and their fertility issues, the eight arrive at Eden, an idyllic island of luxury huts and aqua-blue ocean (Joey: ''Holy s---, this looks like a screensaver!'') in Bora Bora. But, of course, it's a bogus paradise. There are circling sharks, ''Couples Skill Building'' counselors with even sharper teeth, a goofy idiot of a French guru (Jean Reno), and an even more idiotic French Fabio of a yoga instructor (Carlos Ponce) who pins everyone into high -lariously overt sexual positions. Meanwhile, bubbling just under the surface of the film's variety pack of marital strife is that prickly Vaughn/Favreau hostility.
Favreau now plays men with incredibly short fuses, and he's funny every time his gets lit. He also does great double takes when a waiter catches him attempting to pleasure himself to a brochure photo. As for Vaughn, he remains a testy master of talking circles around himself, as in the moment when Dave realizes that his assigned couples therapist, played with yummy smugness by John Michael Higgins, is doing all he can to make the marriage worse. Later, after being nicked by a shark, Vaughn turns his ''close encounter'' with death into an anxiety attack that keeps on giving.
The movie builds toward a clandestine group voyage to the other side of the Eden resort, the section of the island devoted to Dionysian Jell-O-shot-happy singles. To our jaded couples, it's forbidden paradise  a fleshpot Bali Hai. Up until this point, Couples Retreat  has a pleasantly relaxed, episodic rhythm. As the plot kicks in, it grows more impersonal, though I did enjoy the ''athletic'' climax: a Guitar Hero  duel, amusing because even the winner's victory is so desperately vicarious. Couples Retreat  is fluff, a genially banal message comedy about learning to live with your spouse by staying true to yourself. But thanks to Vaughn, Favreau, and the stray sharp lines that pop out of everyone else, the film at least offers the lively sound of egos that still know how to swing. B–



 “Couples Retreat” is a comedy of exhaustion. I don’t mean that the four couples in question — three married and one a post-divorce May-September rebound — are suffering from conjugal fatigue. They are, but not in any interesting or revealing way. It is the comedy itself, in both concept and execution, that seems tired.  The cast includes a lot of familiar faces: Jason Bateman, Ken Jeong, John Michael Higgins and a bunch of others. The script was written (along with Dana Fox) by Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn, who also star. Some of the jokes are mildly risqué, some are mildly funny and nearly all have a slightly dented, tattered aspect, as if they had been dug out of a Hollywood Goodwill drop box for used gags.  Speaking of the needy, I think I mentioned that Vince Vaughn stars in this movie, vacantly ambling through yet another iteration of his neurotic-fussbudget-trapped-in-the-body-of-a-stevedore persona. This time his name is Dave, and he’s married to Ronnie (Malin Akerman), with whom he leads a life overloaded by kids, home renovations and the usual burdens of domestic bliss.  His pals are much less blissful. Jason (Mr. Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell), supercompulsive yuppies, are on the verge of divorce because they can’t conceive a child. Joey (Mr. Favreau) and Lucy (Kristin Davis), high-school sweethearts whose teenage daughter is about to leave the nest, are on the verge of divorce for reasons that seem to have been left on the editing-room floor. Shane (Faizon Love) has already split from his wife (Tasha Smith), who arises from the editing-room floor near the end to do something that seems surprising only because the film is so haphazardly and incoherently put together.  Shane is with a 20-year-old named Trudy (Kali Hawk), who calls him Daddy. They join the rest of the couples on a tropical counseling vacation on a palm-studded island, during which the hapless eight are subjected to some of the weariest jokes about therapy, yoga, men in saunas and other hilarious matters. The place is run by a guru played by Jean Reno, one of whose minions plays Guitar Hero with Mr. Vaughn, while another one talks with a funny accent. Things take a shocking turn when —  —  Sorry, I was dozing off, thinking of another movie. Things do not take a surprising turn in “Couples Retreat,” which was directed by Peter Billingsley. It seems to have been hastily trimmed down to PG-13 acceptability, which means that some of the raunch implied in the trailers that began running in theaters over the summer has been lost. Not that I miss it. An R-rated version of this mess would be only more gratingly dishonest as it tried to hide its weak sentimentality behind a fig leaf of vulgarity.  Instead, some vague intimations of satire are abandoned, as if therapists, yoga instructors, Guitar Hero-playing twits and married people might have their feelings hurt if anything too funny happened. And so not much does. Mr. Vaughn whines after being grazed by a shark. Mr. Bateman and Ms. Bell argue cutely. Mr. Favreau and Ms. Davis ogle and snarl. Mr. Love is the funny fat guy. The lesson is that everyone should have skipped the retreat and stayed home in bed. I wish I had.  “Couples Retreat” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). People wear bathing suits and talk about sex.

"Couples Retreat" is one of those movies that makes moviemaking look like the luckiest job in the world. Those involved got to spend weeks at a Bora Bora luxury resort; all we get is this not lousy but unmemorable tropical-vacation comedy. Reuniting several frequent past collaborators (most notably "Swingers" alums Vince Vaughn and Jon Favreau), the tale of four couples at a relationship workshop in an exotic locale has a good premise, an appealing cast and some bright ideas that only fly so high due to pedestrian execution. Still, pleasant-enough results should earn solid midrange B.O. numbers.
After a nice opening-credits montage of couples imagery since cinema's beginning, we're introduced to various Illinois duos. Dave (Vaughn) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman) have a happy, slightly chaotic household with two young sons and a normal amount of stress. On the other hand, former high school sweethearts Joey (Favreau) and Lucy (Kristin Davis) are just hanging on until their daughter's imminent departure for college, at which point they'll gladly separate.
Shane (Faizon Love) has recently divorced the wife he could never please (Tasha Smith) and taken up with 20-year-old wild thang Trudy (Kali Hawk). She calls him "Daddy" -- which, indeed, he might be mistaken for. And though they seem perfect for each other, persnickety pair Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kristen Bell) drop a bombshell: After eight years' wedlock undone by failure to conceive, they worry they aren't soulmates after all.
Determined to give it one last shot, Jason and Cynthia have found a program -- at the alluring Eden Resort, billed as "Disneyland for adults" --that could salvage their relationship. Trouble is, they can only afford the group rate. They beg the others to sign on, promising them they can enjoy fun in the sun while Cynthia and Jason work on "renewing bonds."
Upon arrival, Eden (actually the St. Regis in Bora Bora) proves duly idyllic, and the inevitable tourist shots of its splendid setting come as a relief after thesp-turned-producer-turned-first-time-director Peter Billingsley's blah-looking first reel. But world-famed "couples whisperer" Marcel (Jean Reno) has a program in store that's much more intensive than expected. Far from being allowed to snorkel, doze and work on their tans, the couples are expected -- even demanded -- to rise at dawn for "skill-building exercises" that are like a kind of New Age boot camp. These push the central duos -- and the friendships between them -- to near-breakup points.
While the inevitable happy endings are orchestrated with just enough finesse to satisfy, elsewhere "Couples Retreat" wobbles. The screenplay (credited primarily to Favreau, with Vaughn and Dana Fox billed beneath), sports a fair number of good throwaway lines but could be a lot sharper overall.
Billingsley's workmanlike helming delivers a couple of hilarious scenes; the PG-13 pic's raunchiest moments include a frustrating erotic-massage interlude for Lucy and Joey, and a sexually inappropriate yoga class taught by hunky Salvadore (Carlos Ponce). Yet elsewhere, the helmer impresses too little imagination or personality, failing to blend seriocomic tones that occasionally tumble into the heavy-handed, maudlin or cloying (via some horribly precocious child-actor moments).
Pic moves briskly but, at 113 minutes, clocks long for a mainstream comedy; more inspiration in tech/design departments would have been welcome. Thesps remain amiable, even if all have been deployed to greater advantage elsewhere -- the exception being relative newcomer Hawk, whose character is a giddy party-hearty contrast to the older principals, and whose performance is a consistent hoot.
