 “Flannel Pajamas” is the unassuming title of a film that might more accurately have been called “Scenes From a Mixed Marriage” or “Annie Hall Without Laughs.” The twin specters of Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen hover over this talky history of a relationship between two New Yorkers — from courtship to marriage to separation —  yet it conveys little sense of the volcanic emotional upheaval evoked so memorably in Mr. Bergman’s ’70s masterpiece, “Scenes From a Marriage.”  Instead of opposing armies clashing in a primal battle of the sexes, or mismatched romantics wistfully waving at each other from a distance, the film portrays domestic discord as a series of tiny skirmishes in a civilized and ultimately banal power struggle between two people with incompatible agendas. The combatants, Stuart (Justin Kirk) and Nicole (Julianne Nicholson), who meet on a blind date, are garden-variety urban neurotics who express their disharmony in snits and sulks instead of rages and Shakespearean soliloquies.  To put it another way, we are these people, or rather those of us who have difficulty expressing full-blown anger. Passive-aggression is the prevailing (and sometimes cringe-inducing) psychological mode.  The personal issues bedeviling Stuart and Nicole may not be your issues or mine, but the couple’s mild-mannered approach to dealing with them may feel uncomfortably familiar if you belong to the college-educated class of New York professionals that believes in talking things out. You might call it the modern, pragmatic, couples-counseling approach to problem solving, as opposed to, say, primal scream therapy or (God forbid) domestic violence.  The adage that the Devil is in the details applies to Stuart and Nicole’s marriage, whose success or failure  depends on things as trivial as one partner’s dropping everything to fetch coffee for the other at a stressful moment. The tone of “Flannel Pajamas” is the same hyper-articulate one that Jeff Lipsky, who wrote and directed the movie, brought to his 1997 debut film, “Childhood’s End.”  In the mixed marriage under the film’s microscope, Stuart, a cocky, Long Island-born Jewish promoter of Broadway shows (who weirdly seems to have no social life), courts and marries Nicole, an aspiring caterer, chef and cookbook writer from Missoula, Mont., whose Irish Catholic family has a history of alcoholism.  It isn’t until very late in the film when Nicole’s mother, Elizabeth (Rebecca Schull), bluntly voices her anti-Semitism that the differences in their cultural backgrounds snap into focus as a residual force driving them apart.  Mr. Lipsky’s screenplay, a messy collection of fragments arranged chronologically, adds up to one of the most intimate screen portraits of a relationship ever attempted. The movie literally strips its characters naked, with full frontal nude shots of both (they’re reasonably attractive people in their 30’s) and unvarnished if not very graphic sex scenes that convincingly demonstrate the characters’ erotic chemistry.  In assessing Stuart’s and Nicole’s characters, the movie wants to play fair but ends up favoring Stuart, a glib romancer who pays off Nicole’s student loans and encourages her to set up a catering business in his 36th-floor Manhattan high-rise (with river view). When things go wrong, he says all the right things to try to win her back.  The first major sign of trouble appears when Nicole announces that she would like to start a family immediately (she wants three children), and Stuart asks her to wait for two years so they can enjoy each other without distraction. She agrees reluctantly, as long as they can have a dog in the meantime, but he resists even that.  “Flannel Pajamas” teems with more subsidiary characters than it can comfortably handle. They include Stuart’s mentally unstable brother, Jordan (Jamie Harrold),  who infuriates Nicole by having loud, combative trysts when he stays at their apartment. Stuart detests Nicole’s cynical best friend, Tess (Chelsea Altman), a nurse who sleeps around.  Although the film includes some lovely set pieces (the couple’s wedding in Missoula is a triumph of ensemble acting), its loose structure makes much of it feel haphazardly thrown together. The 124 minutes  would be considerably more absorbing had greater care been taken in developing a coherent narrative momentum.  “Flannel Pajamas” nevertheless maintains a stubborn integrity, and its comfortably lived-in lead performances feel authentic. It is also slightly dispiriting.

"Flannel Pajamas" is a nonstop talkfest that intimately charts the arc of a relationship from its intoxicating beginning to its frayed dissolution. Much better written than directed by longtime distribution exec Jeff Lipsky, pic features frequently lively dialogue peppered by acute observations into the ebb and flow of amorous interactions between intelligent individuals. Film's emotional accessibility and strong lead performances by Justin Kirk and Julianne Nicholson suggest further fest rounds and possible specialized theatrical play, although the incessant gab finally wears out its welcome and will limit audience interest to upscale urban situations.
With no background as a dramatist and just one previous feature, the 1997 "Childhood's End," on his resume, Lipsky does an impressive job establishing a rapport between the principal characters, as well as between characters and the viewer.
We meet Stuart (Kirk) and Nicole (Nicholson) at a Gotham diner in the middle of their first date, accompanied by mutual friends and, at the next table, by Stuart's eccentric brother Jordan (Jamie Harrold). The warmly humorous conversation flows with a seemingly effortless charge, and there's no doubt where this relationship is headed.
In fact, it's hard to imagine how things could be better between them. The sex is great (pic is frank on this score, with plenty of blunt talk and full-frontal nudity), and the highly verbal (but not glib) Stuart always says the right thing to reassure the sometimes moody Nicole. Given Stuart's leading-man looks, quick mind and stated desire to make Nicole happy, he's got it all going, and she has an unaffected, down-to-earth quality, that reflects her Montana roots and sets her apart.
In fact, when Nicole takes Stuart to Missoula for Christmas, the result is not an "Annie Hall"- or "The Family Stone"-style weirdo gathering but a virtual love-feast, one that smoothes the way for a marriage proposal (a particularly fine and unorthodox scene played out in bed) and wedding. (One unconvincing element is the Montana compound, which looks more like the Eastern U.S. in autumn than the far north during the holidays.)
Once the couple settles into real life in Stuart's 36th floor condo with a view, they get down to brass tacks: Nicole wants to start a catering business; they agree not to have a child for two years, although Nicole soon begins agitating for a dog, and, eventually, Stuart gets an opportunity to start his own business.
One dramatic shortcoming is how little Stuart's career is integrated into their lives. He's a Broadway theater marketing and promotions wiz, and people in showbiz, particularly someone as gregarious and good-looking as Stuart, tend to have a wide circle of acquaintances and lead lives that revolve around their work. Strangely, however, he almost never discusses his projects or friends, and despite the film's concentration on the minute workings of Stuart and Nicole's emotional life, the latter seems unrealistically cocooned from a social world that would almost automatically be a major part of their routine.
After tragedy strikes Stuart's family and multiple disappointments hit Nicole, he evolves positively, while she withdraws into sullen numbness. Religious issues -- he's Jewish, she's Catholic -- are dragged in that seemed so irrelevant earlier on they weren't even mentioned in relation to the wedding.
Whereas in the beginning, the sense of heightened naturalism is strong enough to sustain the proceedings without much structure, the final stretch would have benefited from a stronger dramatic hand to accelerate the denouement; one becomes anxious for resolution considerably before the two-hour point.
Visually, the film is without flair or ambition, conveying no sense of atmosphere or mood.
But the performances put it over. Kirk, best known for his starring turn in the "Angels in America" telefilm, is winning as a bright young man who does not shy from intimacy and is ready to put his all into a committed relationship. Nicholson, freckled and thin, has a natural, real woman appeal and discreetly puts across a full range of emotions without ever coming across as actressy. Harrold is a scene-stealer as Stuart's effusive, ill-fated brother.

Indie-film exec Jeff Lipsky 's sophomore feature as writer-director shares with his distribution work a desire to restore some of the untidier virtues of '70s American film. For one thing, that means the well-off thirtysomething couple in this epic study of a relationship's slow deteriorationfrom horniness to marriage and consensual masturbation in place of sexspends less time charming its bourgeois audience than making it squirm in unflattering recognition. Money, believably, drives a wedge between PR spinmaster Stuart (Justin Kirk ) and the underachieving Nicole (Julianne Nicholson ), yet Lipsky, to his credit, portrays everything in the relationship family planning not leastas a kind of minutely calculated business transaction. (Peeing in the tub can be forgiven, but not debt.) At a full two hours, Lipsky's talky movie is more compelling in its second half, when the spouses finally get around to being themselves. "You never used to talk to me like this when we were dating," says Nicole. "Were you just censoring yourself back then?"
