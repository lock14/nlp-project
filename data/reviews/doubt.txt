John Patrick Shanley's 'Doubt' presents Meryl Streep as a monster of moral certainty
"Doubt," John Patrick Shanley's award-winning play about a nun, a priest, and the unseemly accusation that puts them at each other's throats, has been reimagined for the movies. Now it's full of thunderclaps, autumnal blasts of wind, and the terrifying facial expressions of Meryl Streep, who is otherwise cloaked to her chin in black vestments.
Her bespectacled Sister Aloysius may be a woman of God, but given Streep's squalling and Shanley's indulgent direction, it might be more useful to think of her as a bird of prey. In one of the opening scenes she swoops in and thwaps a child foolish enough to sleep during a Sunday sermon. "Straighten up!" she hisses.
"Doubt," which was subtitled "A Parable" when it arrived off-Broadway in 2004, is now "Doubt, A Gothic Horror Movie," with Streep serving as its resident bogeywoman.
The outlines of the story are the same. We are in a Bronx Catholic school in 1964, where Sister Aloysius, as principal, runs the operation with a proverbial iron fist. She's trying to instill vigilance in Sister James (Amy Adams), her hopelessly kind youngest teacher.
Instead, the elder nun creates a monster. Sister James begins to suspect that the school's popular priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), is having an inappropriate relationship with one of her pupils, an altar boy and the school's only black student. She meekly takes her suspicion to Sister Aloysius, who gathers all her righteousness to insinuate a nasty case against Father Flynn, a thoughtful, compassionate man with an expanding capacity for rage - at least where the principal is concerned.
The questions the movie raises are still compelling. Is Father Flynn guilty, and, if so, is there a mitigating circumstance that might absolve him? Should certitude ever be absolute? Yet as a consideration of faith and propriety, the movie never managed to boil my blood or break my heart. Over the play's brief running time (about an hour and a half), you could feel the walls closing in and the ceiling shrinking to meet the floor. You wanted air as much as you wanted unambiguous resolution. As a piece of writing, the best thing about "Doubt" was that it gave you neither.
By opening up the play, Shanley reduces the story's moral intensity. This includes the most astonishing moment on stage, a conversation between Sister Aloysius and the boy's mother, whom Viola Davis plays with superhuman restraint. Their talk has been staged during a walk on a breezy morning, not as a closed-door showdown, bringing with it the self-consciousness that comes when two people disagree in public. Davis is a volcano forced to hold her lava, lest she make a scene. I guess I'm guilty of wanting the scene.
Shanley has created an authentically foreboding Catholic-school atmosphere, yet doesn't trust the pure tension of his tale to absorb us. The bells and whistles aren't merely ornamental. They're desperate to convey meaning. Beware that light bulb symbolically on the fritz. And look out for the close-up of the crucifix that's almost used as an ice pick. The score, while it lacks for demonic choral chanting, manages to get turned up high along with the stormy sound effects.
Fortunately, this doesn't corrupt all the performances. Hoffman is terrific, not giving away more than he should. He sets up shop in the familiar exasperated register that leaves him spitting and makes his face turn blue. Adams finds yet another way of playing meek and naive. This time she's a church mouse.
Streep, of course, is the piece de resistance. If only she resisted a little more.
All the poise she used to capture haughty rectitude in "The Devil Wears Prada" has been turned upside down. Now it's rectitude run amok. During the movie's first half she's shrewdly insinuating, but at some point, the weeping and irritability make the character transparent - this nun sheds crocodile tears. Streep probably meant to complicate this woman, when the truth is that Sister Aloysius's steely single-mindedness is actually quite simple, which is why the movie's (and the play's) abrupt final scene is a cop-out.
Shanley seems as cowed by Streep as the kids at the school are by Sister Aloysius. He just lets her exhaust a range of ominous facial expressions. It's like watching a jack-o'-lantern pull out all the stops. She didn't make me want to confess, but I do believe I've found next year's Halloween costume.


Frost/Nixon  is a fact-based drama, starring Michael Sheen and Frank   Langella, about a mid-1970s confrontation between a wily British TV host and a   disgraced American president. Doubt  is a fictional drama, starring Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman, about a mid-1960s confrontation between an imperious Bronx nun in charge of a parochial school and a liberal priest she is convinced has behaved improperly with a student. The two might seem to have nothing in common, save that both previously enjoyed award-laden Broadway runs, and both are currently receiving Prestige Movie treatment.
But the pair, taken together, constitute a rewarding study in the opportunities and pitfalls of adaptation. Frost/Nixon , directed with practiced fluidity by Ron Howard, surges with an energy and visual verve that improve the play and enhance the themes of dramatist Peter Morgan's script  about the codependency of media and politics, and about the vanities of ambitious men shaping public images. Doubt , fussily overdirected by its author, John Patrick Shanley, dulls the play's own sharp inquiries into the dangerous power of those who profess certainty with God on their side.
Frost/Nixon  trusts Sheen and Langella to re-create the roles they first originated to such acclaim in London in 2006, then moved to Broadway in 2007. Certainly the two stars know their characters inside and out: There's David Frost, the striving TV-age smoothie who savored his jet-set lifestyle but craved journalistic legitimacy; and there's Richard M. Nixon, the infinitely complicated politician forced to resign in the wake of Watergate, who craved  well, obviously, he craved something, since he agreed (for a handsome fee) to sit with Frost through 12 days of taped interrogation. With the transcript as his guide, Morgan explores psychological terrain: how Frost found the chutzpah to land the interviews; how Nixon played cat and mouse with his interlocutor when asked to admit wrongdoing and apologize; how both men of humble beginnings felt stung by the scorn of those born with more  privilege; and how both were superb manipulators. But Sheen (who played the very model of a modern British go-getter as Tony Blair in The Queen , also written by Morgan) and Langella (operating at the peak of his powers) are disciplined enough to crop their performances to close-up size. (The sizing echoes the look of the   actual interviews.) And Howard is smart   to enhance the one-on-ones with journalistic context, weaving archival Watergate-era   footage into his fictionalized re-creation.
Streep and Hoffman, in contrast, translate roles memorably created by Cherry Jones and Brían F. O'Byrne as Sister Aloysius and Father Flynn. Without a doubt, the movie stars are primo ''gets'' in the famous-name sweepstakes. (They're aided by Viola   Davis in a blazing, brief appearance as the mother of the boy who may or may not have received the priest's inappropriate attentions, and by Amy Adams in the wan role of a susceptible younger nun who becomes the agent of Sister Aloysius' terrible righteousness.) But Hoffman and Streep, especially, are also vulnerable actors in need of guidance from a director with a strong vision. And Shanley, in his first movie-helming gig since he leaped into his own script for Joe Versus the Volcano  nearly two decades ago and lost, turns out to have dismayingly few original cinematic notions to back up the basic did-he-or-didn't-he hook in his study of conviction and compassion. There's not a wind-whipped leaf, rain-hammered window, or burned-out lightbulb the director doesn't admire, lest we ignore a metaphor about spiritual crisis.
Meanwhile, Streep, apparently left to her own devices, lugs a load of mannerisms under the pruny nun's severe black habit, encouraged by the movie's literal-minded director. Sister A may be an intimidating, spirit-breaking character  but for all that, she's also   a servant of God unswerving in her code of right and wrong, and we ought to feel her burden. We don't. Speaking lines written to reach the stage heavens, the cast is infernally noisy and hectoring about mysteries that ought   to be felt with a communal hush. I doubt that's what the creator  I mean the playwright  had in mind.  Doubt : C+ ; Frost/Nixon :
Amy Adams talks about Doubt

 The air is thick with paranoia in “Doubt,” but nowhere as thick, juicy, sustained or sustaining as Meryl Streep’s performance as a distrustful nun in John Patrick Shanley’s screen adaptation of his stage play. Wearing flowing black robes, a  bonnet  that squats on her head like an upside-down Easter basket and the kind of  spectacles Mr. Pickwick probably wore to read his papers, Ms. Streep blows in like a storm, shaking up the story’s reverential solemnity with gusts of energy and comedy. The performance may make no sense in the context of the rest of the film, but it is — forgive me, Father — gratifying nunsense.  Although the play, which pivots on accusations of child molestation, was first staged  in 2004 —  two years after the Roman Catholic Church  sex-abuse scandals erupted in America —  it unfolds at a  historical remove in 1964. Sister Aloysius (Ms. Streep), the principal of a Catholic school in the Bronx, comes to suspect that her supervisor, Father Flynn (a tamped-down Philip Seymour Hoffman), has developed an erotic interest or worse in one of their charges, Donald (Joseph Foster II), the school’s first and only black student. Shored up by the tentative suspicions of a younger nun, Sister James (an unsteady Amy Adams), Sister Aloysius begins circling Father Flynn, going in for the kill. Sister James has doubts. Sister Aloysius has, well, none.  As its title announces, “Doubt” isn’t about certainty, but ambiguity, that no man’s land between right and wrong, black and white. This gray zone paradoxically can be  easier to grapple with on the stage, where ideas sometimes range more freely because they are not tethered to representations of the real world. Mainstream moviemaking, with its commercial directives and slavish attachment to narrative codes, by contrast, isn’t particularly hospitable to ambiguity. It insists on clear parameters, tidy endings, easy answers and a world divided into heroes and villains, which may help explain why Mr. Shanley’s film feels caught between two mediums and why Ms. Streep appears to be in a Gothic horror thriller while everyone else looks and sounds closer to life or at least dramatic realism.  Despite its theological asides and weighty moral stakes, “Doubt” essentially boils down to a shell game: you think you see the pea under this or that shell, but the prize (answer) remains tauntingly out of reach. So does Father Flynn, a character who for a long stretch appears above reproach: a good, caring, forward-thinking man whose only crime seems to be tolerance. When he suggests that the school add a secular song to its Christmas lineup as a way of reaching out to the community, Sister Aloysius reacts as if he had suggested  human sacrifice instead. That he seems to embody the spirit of reform handed down by Second Vatican Council, which ended in 1965,  makes him all the more sympathetic.  Directing from his own script, Mr. Shanley chips away at this sympathy, pulling the story and your feelings this way and that. One of the most eccentric moments in the film occurs when Father Flynn, after admonishing some male students about their dirty fingernails, shows off his long, carefully manicured nails. Mr. Shanley complicates this feeling of gender ambiguity   later when Father Flynn, having gone to Sister Aloysius’s office for a meeting, sits behind her desk without asking permission, an assertion of power that opens a fissure in his easygoing facade and says more about the church and gender than any of their increasingly heated exchanges. Mostly, though, the characters talk, and Mr. Shanley throws a frame around  their heads.  Words make the world go ’round  here through repetitions, indirection, allusion as well as a cunning deployment of the barely said and the flat-out unspeakable. (The word “pedophilia” is never uttered.) When Sister James tells Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn has “taken an interest” in Donald, the words reverberate like a struck bell. Later, when Donald’s mother (Viola Davis, shaking the film up with a few extravagantly mucousy minutes) explains to Sister Aloysius why she wants to keep her son at school, no matter what the truth about the priest, her words resonate partly because they remain veiled by shame, propriety, fear, inequality, pain. What are you telling me? Sister Aloysius demands of the stunned mother, though it’s clear they both know the answer.  Mr. Shanley has nothing deep to say about the church and its sex scandals, and he’s still largely using words and more words, despite the tilted camera angles and pretty pictures. But the words are good, solid, at times touching. His work with the actors is generally fine, though it’s a mystery what he thought Ms. Streep, with her wild eyes and an accent as wide as the  Grand Concourse, was doing. Her outsize performance has a whiff of burlesque, but she’s really just operating in a different register from the other actors, who are working in the more naturalistic vein of modern movie realism. She’s a hoot, but she’s also a relief, because, for some of us, worshiping Our Lady of Accents is easier on the soul than doing time in church.    “Doubt” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Intimations of child sexual abuse.
Back in the early 1980s, when I was a graduate student in Boston, a prominent professor I knew was accused of sexually harassing a female colleague. This man was a compulsive flirt who couldn't get within feet of a woman without coming on to her, so I wasn't altogether surprised that he had come under suspicion. But long before an internal inquiry cleared him of all charges—and unearthed his mentally unstable accuser's impressive history of workplace mayhem—many in the powerful local feminist community had written him off as guilty by virtue of sleazy character. The fallout from this case, measured in reckless disregard for due process and subsequent private misery all round, made a deep impression on me. So I came with up-front sympathy to John Patrick Shanley 's Doubt , the film adaptation of his award-winning play about an old-school Catholic nun who goes after a priest she suspects of sexual abuse.
In a hyperreactive news culture increasingly ruled by caffeinated bloggers who prize speed of coverage over the search for evidence, any movie that questions public rushes to judgment wins points going in. But Doubt  is only marginally, and tendentiously, about moral uncertainty—it's more about the sins of a nosy old biddy who pulls out all the stops when going through the official channels of a male-dominated Catholic Church would get her nowhere. With its bristling topicality, ritzy cast, and the added bonus of Roger Deakins 's gracefully bleak cinematography, Doubt  is being squired around town as prime Oscar bait. But in Shanley's hands, it only looks deep.
Where the complication of received ideas might roam free, callow provocation rules, ushered in periodically by waves of premonitory weather. Just for starters, a sleeting rain coats the claustrophobic Bronx  parochial school where timid young Sister James (Amy Adams )—unnerved by what looks like unusually close contact between the school's well-liked priest, Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman ), and its first black pupil (Joseph Foster )—reports her misgivings to the school principal, Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep ). A twitchy termagant swathed in a fearsome bonnet and black taffeta (she looks like something out of Chicken Run ), the older nun has been biding her time—and before you can say, "Independent inquiry," off she bustles in paranoid overdrive to grind the machinery of blind justice into gear.
Written in 2005 at the height of the Catholic Church's sex-abuse scandals, Shanley's play is set in the mid-1960s, with Vatican II  and backwash from the counterculture poised to liberalize what the playwright plainly regards as a joylessly authoritarian establishment. The elephant in the room is several decades in between of rampant sexual abuse by a celibate priesthood, and the fascinating question buried deep under the clever blather of Doubt  is whether it was old-school rigidity that upheld enforced celibacy or the new laxity that allowed this tragedy to unfold under the noses of higher-ups who didn't want to know that they knew. Father Flynn is a jolly, free-spirited fellow who can't rustle his cassock without being cued in by winds of progressive change. But he is seen furtively stuffing a boy's undershirt into a locker, while Sister Aloysius's rabid digging—however unethically conducted—turns up the interesting news that he has been moved from parish to parish over the past five years.
I'd say that was reasonable cause for further research. For Shanley, though, the rather salient question of whether Father Flynn has transgressed matters less than whether the good sister has the right to investigate his behavior at all. Judging from the number of times the camera wanders up to holy ceilings, perhaps only the Almighty can say for sure. Back on earth and staking his claim for keeping an open mind, Shanley pushes moral relativism as far as it will go, which is all the way to preposterous via obnoxious in a key scene between Sister Aloysius and the black boy's mother that's meant to make us go "Aaaah," but made me go "What?!!"
If Doubt  has a point to make about not rushing to judgment, it is overwhelmed by the force of Shanley's profound ambivalence toward women. True, he throws in a biographical tidbit or two to reassure us that Sister Aloysius is not just a man-hating, dried-up old cartoon virgin. But she sure behaves like one, and for that she must be punished with a final meteorological flourish, in which the anguished old nun sits surrounded by snow and ice. It's telling that the movie is dedicated to the real-life Sister James, Shanley's history teacher. But it's history that lets Shanley down: Inadvertently, Doubt  shows us that there are limits to an open mind. Knowing what we know now, I wish there had been more vigilant old bats around like Sister Aloysius to shield Catholic children from the predators within.
