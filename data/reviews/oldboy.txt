         Hinging on a narrative as Byzantine and distorted as a festering grudge, the astonishingly visceral "Oldboy" plays like an extended adrenaline rush following a bad accident. At once real and completely unreal, familiar and deeply strange, violent and comically absurd, South Korean director Park Chanwook's fourth movie, which won the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes in 2004, releases a torrent of imagery as fluid and shifting as a nightmare.
 
  As much as it's about anything recognizable, "Oldboy" is a story about the transformative power of hatred and revenge. It begins with a scene culled straight from a 1970s exploitation movie: A wild-haired man dangles another man off the edge of a building by his tie. He could be Charles Bronson, but he's Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), and he's merely delaying the other guy's suicide long enough to tell his own story.
 


         






    Oh Dae-su has spent the last 15 years imprisoned in a dingy hotel room by an unknown captor for reasons that have never been explained to him. Released only moments ago (the suicidal man is the first human Dae-su has seen, and he touches him disbelievingly, like a long-lost lover), Dae-su's first impulse is to tell his tale.
 
  He starts at the beginning: An ordinary Seoul businessman with a wife and a baby daughter, Dae-su is arrested one night for drunk and disorderly conduct. His friend Joo-hwan (Chi Dae-han) picks him up from the police station, and they stop at a pay phone on the way home. While Joo-hwan talks to Dae-su's little girl, her father disappears.
 
  He comes to in a hotel room with a carpet and wallpaper so thoughtlessly ugly and banal as to seem horrifying. For the next 15 years, Dae-su eats Chinese takeout (fried dumplings only), teaches himself to box, fills notebooks with the names of people he has hurt in his life ("I've lived an ordinary life," he thinks. "I've sinned so much") and watches television. "It's a clock and a calendar," he says in voice-over. "It's your school, home, church, friend and lover." It's also how he finds out that his wife has been murdered and he has been blamed for the crime.
 
  What at first seems like a Sartrean nightmare for the Ramada Inn crowd, however, evolves into a cat-and-mouse tale of revenge. Not long after Dae-su manages to escape, he's hypnotized and released and given new clothes, money and a cellphone. His first stop is a Japanese restaurant, where he meets Mido (Gang Hye-jung), a beautiful young sushi chef, eats a live octopus, gets his first call from his enemy and passes out on the bar.
 
  Too intricate and too full of strange imagery to recount in detail, the plot of "Oldboy" takes Dae-su and Mido on a treasure hunt for his enemy that only gets weirder and more violent as the movie progresses. Dae-su finds the building where he was imprisoned by trying the fried dumplings at every Chinese restaurant with the words "Blue Dragon" in the name. (His clue was a scrap of a takeout menu he found in one of his meals.) He reunites with Joo-hwan and comes to suspect Mido, only to trust her again after his enemy reveals himself.
 
  The enemy, Lee Woo-jin (Yoo Ji-tae), is completely unknown to Dae-su. A mastermind if ever there was one, Woo-jin has given Dae-su five days to figure everything out. This is the first of at least two twists that feel like the climax until "Oldboy" turns another corner — once Dae-su figures out who Woo-jin is and why he hates him, he must decide whether it was knowing what happened to him or avenging it that matters. And there's more.
 
  Chanwook was a philosophy student before he was a filmmaker, and underneath the frenetic action lurk unanswered questions about guilt, responsibility and morality. The central question, close on the heels of every hairpin plot twist, is whether an immoral act is still immoral if the sinner is unaware.
 
  For a movie that feels like a pure pop explosion, it contains hardly a single pop reference. During his time in the hotel room, Dae-su marks the passage of time by watching TV. But the way in which even momentous major news events are funneled into his little room (in split screen we watch him watching reports on the death of Princess Diana, the turn of the millennium, the fall of the World Trade Center) makes them seem contained by the screen, completely foreign to Dae-su's experience.
 
  It makes sense: The character of Dae-su is consumed with the personal, as is his enemy, whose motives, when they are revealed, seem almost surreally subjective. It says something when you come out of a film as weird and fantastical as "Oldboy" and feel that you've experienced something truly authentic. I just don't know what. I can't think of anything to compare it to.

 A Tartan Films release. Director Park Chanwook. Producer Kim Dong-joo. Screenplay by Hwang Jo-yun and Lim Joon-hyung. Story by Tsuchiya Garon & Minegishi Nobuaki. Director of photography Jung Jung-hoon. Running time: 1 hour, 59 minutes. In Korean, with English subtitles.   

The brio and glee that Korean bad-boy filmmaker Park Chanwook brings to the gaudy psycho-shockeroo Oldboy  is undeniable, even impressive. It's the perverse, hard-boiled ugliness of the story to which Park has applied his talents that alienates me. For you, results may vary.
It takes twisted visual and narrative chops to deposit the businessman antihero, Dae-su (Korean star Choi Min-sik), abruptly into solitary confinement in a mysterious prisonlike apartment that's a marvel of cheesy wallpaper, cool club lighting, and surrealist hallucinations (including that sci-fi bad-trip classic, ants under the skin). There's orneriness in letting Dae-su stew for 15 years. And grunge chutzpah is required to abruptly release the guy, then send him into a Japanese restaurant where he bites ravenously into a plate of writhing live octopus. (The sight is a novel gross-out that would daunt the producers of Fear Factor .) As for the plot itself  a nightmare of dislocation and shuffled memories in which Dae-su finds out who imprisoned him and why, unfolding in a Grand Guignol of violence and perversion in which teeth are extracted, a tongue is severed, and sex is incestuous  well, the filmmaker who can dream such creepfest fantasies is the man to whom Quentin Tarantino, a declared Park Chanwook admirer, can tip his Kangol cap in awe.
Oldboy  caused a love-it-or-hate-it stir at Cannes last year, and how could it not: It's an onslaught made to cause a sensation. Consider me simultaneously jolted and depressed.

ne question, perhaps the question, is this: what does art have to do with a guy eating a live octopus, and then hammering a couple of (human) heads? The guy in question, the one doing the gobbling and hammering, is Oh Dae-su, the central character in the frenzied Korean thriller "Oldboy." The latest in pulp-fiction cool, "Oldboy" was directed by Park Chanwook, whose films, including the very fine "Joint Security Area" and the repugnant "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance," have won him admirers in rarefied circles, including the Cannes Film Festival, where last year "Oldboy" took second prize. Given the body count and sadistic violence in "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" and "Oldboy," it's no surprise that Mr. Park's largest fan base may be those cult-film aficionados for whom distinctions between high art and low are unknown, unrecognized and certainly unwelcome. After going on a raucous drunk, an ordinary businessman, Dae-su (the terrific Choi Min-sik, who also starred in Im Kwon-taek's "Chihwaseon"), is mysteriously abducted to a private prison. There, with a television set and a painting of a leering Jesus-like figure for company, Dae-su keeps body and mind together (if barely), mostly by working out and chipping away at his prison walls. Eventually, he's released, whereupon he meets a kindly, predictably beautiful sushi waitress, Mido (Gang Hye-jung), gobbles down that poor octopus and proves that he wields a mean hammer. In time, he comes face to face with his anonymous tormenter, a smoothie with a smile named Lee Woo-jin (Yoo Ji-tae), who gives him five days - or else! - to learn why he was imprisoned. A master of composition, Mr. Park makes some of the snazziest-looking pulp fiction going. He has an impeccable if unoriginal visual style, indebted both to the usual masters (Hitchcock, Kubrick, with a nod at Bu�uel) and especially to David Fincher, whose pop nihilism and dedication to the plasticity of the medium hang heavily over this film. That generally makes "Oldboy" entertaining to watch - notwithstanding the scene in which Dae-su eats a live animal - which is a good thing, because there is not much to think about here, outside of the choreographed mayhem. The screenplay, which the director helped write, is the least of the film's attractions; certainly the puerile, big-bang finish, which flashes the story back to high school and a teenage "slut," suggests that Mr. Park knows the adolescent mindset of his target audience all too well. "Oldboy" is a good if trivial genre movie, no more, no less. There's no denying that Mr. Park is some kind of virtuoso, but so what? So was the last guy who directed a Gap commercial. Cinematic virtuosity for its own sake, particularly as expressed through cinematography - in loop-the-loop camera work and, increasingly, in computer-assisted ornamentation - is a modern plague that threatens to bury us in shiny, meaningless movies. Historically speaking, the most interesting thing about "Oldboy" is that like so much "product" now coming out of Hollywood, it is a B movie tricked out as an A movie. Once, a film like this, predicated on extreme violence and staying within the prison house of genre rather than transcending it, would have been shot on cardboard sets with two-bit talent. It would have had its premiere in Times Square. The fact that "Oldboy" is embraced by some cinephiles is symptomatic of a bankrupt, reductive postmodernism: one that promotes a spurious aesthetic relativism (it's all good) and finds its crudest expression in the hermetically sealed world of fan boys. (At this point, it's perhaps worth pointing out that the head of the jury at Cannes last year was none other than Quentin Tarantino.) In this world, aesthetic and moral judgments - much less philosophical and political inquiries - are rejected in favor of a vague taxonomy of cool that principally involves ever more florid spectacles of violence. As in, "Wow, he's hammering those dudes with a knife stuck in his back - cool!" Or, "He's about to drop that guy and his dog from the roof - way cool!" Kiss-kiss, bang-bang, yawn-yawn. We are a long way from Pasolini and Peckinpah. "Oldboy" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes wall-to-wall extreme sadistic violence, a little sex and partial nudity.
More than any single Korean film as yet released stateside, Park Chanwook 's Oldboy crystallizes the reigning characteristic of its national new wave: narratives driven by unbound emotionalism, and often driven like kamikaze stock cars. You can practically hear the cinephiliac sigh of satisfactionhere, finally, is an importable cinema that is neither Miramax -homogeneous nor benumbed by desolate art-film torpor. Commonly remaking psychodrama into epic heart-pulping tragedy, Korean movieseven comedies like Kwak Jae-young 's My Sassy Girl tend to play for keeps. Feverish and knotted in hot fury, Oldboy  may stand for now as the movement's key exercise in primal-scream therapy. There's little chance of emerging from it unexhausted and unscathed by its cataract of rage and regret.
Like Park's Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance , Oldboy functions as a convulsion of cascading revenge scenarios, but its structural strategies are not easily parsed at first. We are brought face-to-face with Oh Daesu (Choi Min-sik ), a mopey middle-aged middle-classer sodden at the tail end of a miserable binge; soon, he awakes imprisoned in a window-less cell dolled up to resemble a chintzy hotel room, complete with cable TV. Narrating after the fact, Daesu informs us that his unidentified jailers gas the room occasionally to clean up, cut his hair, and bandage his self-inflicted wounds while he is anesthetized. Years passthe luckless victim is fed nothing but fried dumplings, watches a lot of TV (witnessing hunks of history as network news, including 9-11), takes to writing his life story in a notebook so as to fathom who might be exacting such an extravagant vendetta upon him, and occasionally hallucinates digital ants emerging from his skin. It is at this point that the motivated viewer should parcel away this and all reviews for later consultation; Oldboy 's Grand Guignol torque is a draft best taken fresh from the vein.
Eventually Daesu, after 15 years in inexplicable captivity, is released back into the world, but then his travails only begin anew. His deranged lust for retribution pulls him in one direction as his still-unknown tormentor's scheme continues to yank him along in ways that aren't clear to anyone until the hair-whitening finale. Park's is a remarkably brutal filmthe warfare waged on teeth and tongue will separate the pulp geeks from the average filmgoersbut because the story is constructed on such an epic scale emotionally, it fences off a Shakespearean estate for itself in today's moviescape. (Actually, classical Greek drama, John Webster , and the silent films of Tod Browning  may be more appropriate corollaries, all stewed together.) Once you witness Choi stuff a live octopus into his mouth and endure Park's madcap shitstorm of CGI time-and-space curlicues, you can understand why Takashi Miike  has been invoked by shortcutting critics seeking to express the film's experience. But if Miike is the Jello Biafra  of new Asian pulp, Park is its Clash. Whatever its oversteps and excesses (I do think Park ran a little amok with the computer gimcrackery), Oldboy  has the bulldozing nerve and full-blooded passion of a classic.
"You seek revenge, or do you find the truth?" someone says deep in, and like any good noir the movie effortlessly opens wide with questions about punishment, justice, fate, and ethical hygiene. Indeed, the story boils down, as so many Asian melodramas do, to that free-fire zone of modern moral struggle: high school. Winning the top prize from a Tarantino-headed Cannes  jury, Oldboy  may be a filmmaker's tour de force, but props should also be delivered to Choi, whose wretched, Herculean performance as the new millennium's Job could restore your faith in the selfless courage of acting.
