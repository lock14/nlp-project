The Promotion  is about exasperating bosses and eccentric employees. Also, Jenna Fischer   plays a cute working woman with wistful hopes and low expectations. Those similarities to The Office  shouldn't necessarily suggest that this serio-absurdo corporate comedy set in a Chicago-area grocery store will be anything like a popular sitcom set at a Scranton paper supplier. But the workplace created by writer-director Steven Conrad is presented as a sitcom biosphere, so superficial appearance gets in the way of the filmmaker's obviously deeper intentions. Conrad, who wrote The Pursuit of Happyness , sets himself a particularly stiff challenge when he entertains complex, more novelistic notions of the working world  yet casts so many TV players with broad personas in small, showy, shot-on-a-day-off parts, among them SNL's Fred Armisen and Ally McBeal 's Gil Bellows.
The Promotion  flirts with a vibe that's more Harvey Pekar than Steve Carell, but avoids full commitment. Why? An everyday universe where essentially nice guys are sometimes goaded to engage in dirty tricks is certainly a dislocation with which any grown-up can identify. Doug (Seann William Scott  ), a bland supermarket middle manager with a supportive wife (Fischer) and a goldbricking boss (Armisen), thinks he's the leading candidate to become the manager of a branch outlet. But that's before Doug faces competition from Richard (John C. Reilly  ), a maddeningly affable counterpart from a Canadian sister store who drives south from the Land of Nice with his sweet Scottish wife (Lili Taylor  ) in tow, equally intent on nabbing the promotion. Bellows leads a team of suits who will decide the new hire.
As flawed individuals repeatedly try, fail, and try again to improve themselves (Richard heeds the audio advice of a fatuous self-help guru), The Promotion  edges toward some pretty bleak stuff. Then it steps back and laughs, like an office slacker.

 “The Promotion” tells you everything you might want to know but were too uninterested to ask about working as an assistant manager in a supermarket. As this sweet, ineffectual comedy follows two sad sacks competing for the job of manager at a new branch of a Chicago grocery chain, it pointedly avoids the raucous bad-boy clowning of the typical Everyguy farce. Think of it as a polite, tightly muzzled “Clerks.”  The feature directorial debut of Steven Conrad, who wrote the screenplay for “The Pursuit of Happyness,”  “The Promotion” also emulates the television comedy “The Office” by showing that even the dreariest workplace is a quirky little universe unto itself. It flouts the rules of Hollywood comedy by refusing to make the competition the usual struggle between a naïve straight arrow and a treacherous snake. Both Doug (Seann William Scott) and Richard (John C. Reilly) are reasonably likable, youngish men with glaring personality flaws. No matter who wins, both seem destined for lives of mediocrity.  Because both Mr. Scott and Mr. Reilly have played unhinged wild men in earlier movies, you keep waiting for “The Promotion” to burst out of its shell and allow the characters to play outrageous dirty tricks on  each other. But even when the opportunity presents itself, they are too decent to practice that kind of guerrilla warfare.  Frisky, clean-cut Doug,  who narrates the story, is so sure of  victory that he foolishly makes plans to buy a house and lies to his wife (Jenna Fischer) about winning the competition before it has been decided.  When he’s struck in the head with a bottle after mishandling a group of troublemakers who hang out in the parking lot,   he overreacts and sprays Mace in one boy’s face.  Richard,   a garrulous, glad-handing Canadian from a sister store north of the border, is married to a Scottish scold (Lili Taylor). A recovering substance abuser, he stokes his shaky ego by listening to fatuous motivational tapes and sneaks an occasional joint.  But the movie’s whimsy is undercut by its portrayal of the contemporary workplace as a cheerless corporate boot camp overseen by a grim board of directors that is as stern and vigilant as a military tribunal. The supermarket environment is so dreary you might even nickname the movie “The Pursuit of Unhappyness.”  “The Promotion” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations and some strong language.

There will be no promotions stemming from �The Promotion,� a stillborn would-be comedy about job competition between two questionably qualified guys. Premise of a cutthroat contest involving working-class stiffs played by Seann William Scott and John C. Reilly, actors capable of heroic insanity, would seem to promise outrageously amped-up venality. Instead, writer-director Steve Conrad serves up a tonally uncertain look at two borderline losers with an ending that weakly echoes the climax he penned for �The Pursuit of Happyness.� Preemed at SXSW, this planned June 6 Dimension release could get some B.O. mileage out of a campaign touting more laughs than the picture delivers.
When Doug (Scott), the straight-arrow assistant manager of a Chicago-area branch of supermarket giant Donaldson�s, learns the chain will soon open a new store in his neighborhood, he�s convinced he�ll be named its manager. This pleases his affectionate wife (Jenna Fischer) no end, and they make plans to buy a house.
But a rude surprise arrives in the form of Richard (Reilly), an overly nice chap from Canada who announces he�ll be applying for the post as well. Unlike the rigid, tentative Doug, easygoing Richard chats up other employees and generally ingratiates himself when not listening to self-esteem recordings.
The interview process proceeds, and the men commence a mild friendship while also revealing personality problems that might, in the view of the company�s board, diminish their chances for the big job. Doug, for example, deals unsatisfactorily with rude black teenagers who hang out in the store parking lot. 
Richard�s sociability, meanwhile, is quickly clouded by his struggles to keep his substance abuse in the past. His Scottish wife soon leaves with their daughter, bringing his unsettling weirdness more out in the open.
It�s hard to know what Conrad wants the audience to feel about these central characters. On the one hand, they are just regular Joes struggling to make the grade in a highly regimented and impersonal corporate climate, and can be extended sympathy as such. On the other, however, Doug and Richard are both endowed with such worrisome flaws that it�s highly questionable whether either of them is qualified to run a big store.
Conrad�s grip on the film�s style is as uncertain as his intent. Conspicuously bland-looking -- color schemes are unattractive, and Conrad does nothing to justify shooting in widescreen -- the pic never finds an attitudinal groove or any sense of pace to whisk the viewer through the brief running time. When �The Promotion� eventually reveals its parallels to �Happyness,� it becomes depressingly apparent how the entire enterprise has fallen short of its muddled ambitions.
Scott, in particular, seems hamstrung by his straight-and-narrow character, his natural exuberance and talent for lunacy stifled at every turn. Reilly�s Richard at least has some subtext and backstory to work with, but the character is such a lost puppy one can only shudder for the life prospects of his unaccountably forgiving wife, as well as for his daughter.
Production values are low-end. 



Making his directorial debut, screenwriter Steven Conrad  (who previously wrote The Weather Man  and The Pursuit of Happyness ) continues his career-long interest in success and self-fulfillment in America with this low-key, witty, observant farce about two rival assistant managers (Seann William Scott  and John C. Reilly ) vying for a coveted career opportunity at a Chicagoland supermarket. That may risk making The Promotion  sound like an unwanted retread of the forgettable Dane Cook /Jessica Simpson  comedy Employee of the Month , but despite its gimmicky-sounding premise, The Promotion  is, like most of Conrad's work, less concerned with matters of winning or losing than with man's sometimes noble, sometimes deplorable, often futile attempts to distinguish himself from the herd. In his first time behind the camera, Conrad tends to overextend certain recurring gags, but otherwise keeps things on an agreeably modest scale, confining most of the action to his expansive supermarket set (impeccably rendered by production designer Martin Whist ) and clocking out before we've hit the 90-minute mark. As to whether a smart comedy about work and family can itself succeed in a marketplace overrun by idiot farces about reluctant bridesmaids (male and female), shotgun Vegas weddings, and finding or losing Mr./Ms. Right . . . this remains to be seen. Such are the unpredictabilities of life in the checkout aisle.
