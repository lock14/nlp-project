'Next Day Air" comes across in trailers as a lightweight screwball enterprise. Its stars include Donald Faison ("Scrubs"), Mike Epps ("All About the Benjamins"), and Mos Def ("Be Kind Rewind"). It's directed by a guy named Benny Boom.
So why isn't it more fun? Well, to borrow a line from its ad campaign: Think inside the box.
This is a movie that mines its plot from the Stone Age (or is it Stoned Age?) of caper comedies. The trouble begins when bumbling thieves accidentally intercept a shipment of drugs and decide to flip it for a once-in-a-lifetime payday. Chaos, greed, and paranoia ensue. Then the scary drug kingpin shows up to claim his junk. Uh-oh.
Mr. Boom, who is well known as a music-video director ("Scarface: Origins of a Hip Hop Classic") but is making his feature film debut with "Next Day Air," can't decide whether he's creating a comedy, a drama, or a really long 50 Cent video without 50 Cent. Saddled with a schizophrenic, implausible snooze of a screenplay by first-time writer Blair Cobbs, the filmmaker falls back on stylish, supersaturated visuals that feel empty and overdone and seem to justify unflattering comparisons to Guy Ritchie.
When the movie has its comedic face on, it's toggling between the overt silliness of Faison and Def, who play weed-smoking express-mail delivery workers innocently caught up in this mess, and the drier, darker humor of Epps and Wood Harris as the criminally inclined recipients of the misrouted box of cocaine.
There's also a way-over-the-top Latino couple (Cisco Reyes and Yasmin Deliz) who live next  to the thieves and must answer to the drug lord (Emilio Rivera) because they were supposed to take delivery of the package.
None of these characters provides more than a smattering of laughs, but Def is the one guy we might like to see more of, if only because his role is small and better executed than it deserves. Debbie Allen also has a mildly funny cameo, but she'd probably appreciate it if we mostly leave her out of this.
On the more serious side, there's Omari Hardwick and Darius McCrary as career criminals who are quickly enlisted to buy and fence the drugs. These thugs have some deep talks when they aren't intimidating and torturing people.
Isn't that what everyone wants in a Mike Epps movie, deep talks?
Or maybe you just want the next "Next Friday." In any case, what you don't want is "Next Day Air."

A bungled drug shipment causes problems for a pack of dim-witted dealers, not to mention the baby-face deliveryman (Scrubs ' Donald Faison) who gets the address wrong in the first place. Aimlessly directed by first-timer Benny Boom, Next Day Air  just plain doesn't work as entertainment  it's too unpleasant to be a comedy and too vapid to be anything else. Even worse, there's something genuinely depressing about the sang-froid it shows towards its cast (which includes Mike Epps and Mos Def), particularly in the gruesome climax with a pointlessly high body count. If the movie doesn't even care about its characters, then how can we?

 Because “Next Day Air” concerns stoners, thieves, thugs, drug dealers, crackheads, slackers, prostitutes and a Mexican crime lord named Bodega Diablo (Emilio Rivera), it isn’t likely to be appreciated as one of the liveliest revivals of a dormant genre since “Unforgiven” woke the western.  But with a script that snaps, characters that pop, a blaze of streetwise attitude and enough firepower to pulverize a significant chunk of South Philadelphia, “Next Day Air” nears neo-blaxploitation perfection. Good things come in strange packages.  The screenplay, a feat of textural and structural inventiveness by Blair Cobbs, sets in motion a complex underworld farce after a box of high-grade cocaine, improbably shipped from Mexico through an overnight delivery service, is dropped off at the wrong address in a ramshackle Philadelphia apartment building.  Benny Boom, an established director of hip-hop music videos, deftly coordinates a half-dozen intersecting plotlines played to the hilt by an inspired ensemble of character actors. Donald Faison, Mike Epps, Wood Harris, Cisco Reyes, Yasmin Deliz, Omari Hardwick, Darius McCrary and Mos Def inhabit their roles with distinct verbal and physical flair, meshing with a rhythmic precision worthy of the Wu-Tang Clan in its heyday.  Violent and profane but never vulgar or inhuman, “Next Day Air” riffs on the disreputable with respect.  “Next Day Air” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for pervasive language, drug content, some violence and brief sexuality.

Smoke weed, not crack, and use FedEx, not "Next Day Air." Such are the lessons of this low-grade entertainment about a bumbling courier who mistakenly delivers a large stash of coke to two bumbling criminals, angering a bumbling drug dealer and yielding predictably dire consequences in an altogether bumbling excuse for an action-comedy. Genre fans in need of a quick fix should line up for the Summit Entertainment release in urban markets before a speedy homevid dropoff.
Scripted by Blair Cobbs, the blood-spattered Philadelphia story begins with pothead deliveryman Leo (Donald Faison, who co-produced) trying to calm down a roomful of gun-waving gang types. In by-now-passe Tarantino-ish fashion, the pic leaps back in time to two days earlier, when a glumly stoned Leo delivers a large package to the wrong apartment.
That would be the crash-pad of hopelessly inept bank robbers Guch (Wood Harris, who played a much more layered and compelling crook on "The Wire") and Brody (Mike Epps), who think they've hit the jackpot when they open the box and find 10 kilos of premium cocaine inside. The two wannabe hoods make plans to sell the coke to Brody's cousin Shavoo (Omari Hardwick) and his nameless associate (Darius McCrary), while the drugs' intended recipient, Puerto Rican dealer Jesus (Cisco Reyes), goes on the warpath in search of his missing package.
There are only so many fresh ways to spin this scenario, and none of them are revealed in "Next Day Air," which could charitably be praised as not too long (at 84 minutes) and no more painful to endure than any of the multiple homicides committed during the exceptionally gruesome finale.
The violent climax feels weirdly out of touch with the rest of the story, which, as directed by first-timer Benny Boom (a musicvideo vet), has an attention span to match Leo's. Staggering aimlessly along as though in its own drug-induced haze, the tonally erratic pic veers between amusingly flip banter and spasmodic flashbacks to the characters' past misdeeds. Neither vein pushes any of these lowlifes and underachievers beyond stereotype; that they're inhabited capably enough by the actors suggests not authenticity so much as tired routine.
As could be expected, Mos Def drolly pockets the picture with his brief, amusing appearance as Leo's fellow courier. And while women have little to do here besides strip and make out, Dominican-Colombian bombshell Yasmin Deliz leaves a sultry impression as Jesus' mouthy moll, and Debbie Allen gets a few laughs as Leo's mouthy mom.
Lensing looks sludgy and cheap, which suits the characters and setting; editing is punchy but not too abrasive. Soundtrack is on the slim side but includes songs performed by Robin Thicke and 50 Cent, both of whom Boom has directed in videos.
