Accepted
 asserts that a college run by students with self-paced, self-taught classes might be better than the institutionalized, bureaucratic alternative. But who wants education advice from the creators of such a witless, uninspired excuse for a college comedy? Said school, dubbed the South Harmon Institute of Technology (uh oh, look what the acronym spells!), is the brainchild of Bartleby Gaines (played by Long, from those PC vs. Mac commercials), a slacker who received rejection from every college to which he applied. After his parents essentially tell him, "We don't love you unless you get into college," he creates a fake acceptance letter from a fake college in hopes of winning their affection. But then he realizes he needs a fake campus, too, as his parents need to drop him off somewhere. No worries, though. Creating a college is really easy: Make a Web site; rent out an abandoned, decrepit psychiatric ward; then get a few friends together with some spit and elbow grease, and presto! Gaines' computer-whiz buddy makes a miscalculation though: In order to give the Web site legitimacy, he adds a fully functional applications system. So, just as Gaines and his buddies are about to relax at their makeshift college, a slew of students shows up ready for class, tuition checks in hand. Thus begins Gaines' college-reformation movement, in which he encourages the students to make up their own classes, then take them. It works like a charm. Suddenly, students who thought they were destined for failure begin to blossom creatively while learning valuable skills like BMX jumping and woodcarving. But the evil dean of the real Harmon College wants to shut them down, not just for copyright infringement but also because he hates creativity, learning, and, probably, most students. The latter sentiment isn't hard to empathize with. Long comes off as smug and annoying, and his buddies just came off some stereotype assembly line. Aside from a few parts where people run into things, the entire film rests on these witless characters to provide the humor. There's a bit of relief when Lewis Black steps in as an embittered ex-professor, but even his rants feel forced in the context of the film. Perhaps the lowest point comes when Long jumps onstage during a party and delivers an embarrassing rendition of "Blitzkrieg Bop." It's an obvious nod to Rock 'n' Roll High School
 that mostly serves as a grim reminder of how far comedies about the education system have fallen.


The dog days of August were made for good-natured cinematic swill, and ``Accepted," a rude, crude, engagingly slap-happy campus comedy was made for August. That applies whether you catch it in theaters this weekend or stumble across it in December on pay-cable. Low of brow and pure of heart, the movie plays like ``Animal House" extra-lite, and as such it's decent indecent fun.
It helps -- a lot -- that Justin Long is in the lead as perennially underachieving college wannabe Bartleby ``B . " Gaines. Long has played sweet-faced doofi in movies such as ``Dodgeball," ``The Break-Up," and ``Waiting . . ." (in which he almost made that movie's nasty jokes palatable), but you probably know him as the smug Mac guy in those Mac vs . PC ads. Don't hold that against him; in ``Accepted," Long comes across as David Schwimmer with a spine and a plan.
Bartleby is such a screw-up that he hasn't been accepted at any of the eight colleges to which he has applied. He's also so resourceful that he cooks up a way to keep his tightly wound father (Mark Derwin) from hitting the roof; if most of his classmates are attending the snooty Harmon University nearby, he'll invent 
a college that will accept him. With some brainstorming and Web wizardry, the South Harmon Institute of Technology is born. If you haven't noticed what the school's acronym spells out, ``Accepted" is happy to remind you. Over and over.
That's the one labored gag in a comedy that successfully walks the thin line between stoopid and stupid. The ruse gets out of control: Dad wants to visit the campus, so B. finds an abandoned mental hospital and turns it into a viable (more or less) college with the help of his equally unmatriculated friends, injured jock Hands (Columbus Short), weirdo Glen (Adam Herschman), and Ivy League reject Rory (Maria Thayer). They need a dean, so failed college professor and borderline lunatic Uncle Ben (comedian Lewis Black) is commandeered.
Then the rest of the students arrive -- all 500 of them. It turns out the South Harmon website has kicked out acceptance letters like spam, and B. is now the administrator of a school that doesn't exist. His student body is a police line up of surfers, ex-strippers, ADD basket cases, and thugs. The curriculum? Whatever you want it to be, man. There are classes in ``Slacking 101," ``Men: The Weaker Sex," and ``The Decline and Fall of Chevy Chase" (ouch
). It's like the hippie educational ideal of the '60s channel ed through ``Porky's."
A movie like this has to have WASPy meanies, and over at Harmon University there's the vile Dean Van Horn (Anthony Heald) and his fratboy minion Hoyt Ambrose (Travis Van Winkle), respectively standing in for Dean Wormer and Greg Marmalard of ``Animal House." B.'s best friend, a hopeless social freak named Sherman (Jonah Hill), takes on Stephen Furst's old ``Flounder" role.
Meanwhile, Hoyt's girlfriend, the beauteous Monica (Blake Lively), is enough of a free spirit that she's quickly drawn across town to South Harmon and to B., and there's never any doubt as to where the movie in general is heading: an appearance before the college accreditation committee and the chance for Bartleby to say things like ``It's not just about us anymore!"
If the jokes are sloppy and the characters generic, director Steve Pink keeps the genial vibe going for longer than he has any right to. (Pink wrote ``High Fidelity" and ``Grosse Point Blank" and effectively steps down a few rungs here so he can step up into the director's chair.) ``Accepted" trots out a few timid notions about breaking open the stifling university model, but rebellion is the last thing on anyone's mind. Like all Hollywood youth comedies about nonconformity, it's conformist at heart; unlike most of the others, it puts a crass smile on your face while playing it safe.

Accepted  at first appears to bear the anarchic fingerprints of its off-the-quad forebears, from the legendary (Animal House ) to the lackluster (Van Wilder ), with a hint of Ghostbusters ' entrepreneurial pluck. The story centers on one Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long), a charming yet oddly pratfall-prone adolescent con artist who, staring at eight rejected college applications, whips up a fake school with the help of his overachieving bud, Sherman (the nicely dry Jonah Hill). But the illusion is too perfect, and soon, Bartleby has a class of misfits matriculating at his homemade South Harmon Institute of Technology (the acronym, if you're wondering, is very  deliberate), complete with classes like ''Doing Nothing'' and ''Blowing S--- Up With Your Mind.'' Naturally, a showdown brews between the dream-chasing slackers and monolithic, overstructured Harmon University, which breeds nothing but ''stress freaks and caffeine addicts.''
At this point, goofball subversion begins to mosh uncomfortably with sermonizing love-in, and Patch Adams Goes to College  nearly breaks out. Accepted's winning dumbness and breezy bons mots  save it from the pit, but one wonders: In an age when a petulant ''It's hard '' excuses the grossest failures, and all of us, the Establishment especially, are rewarded for playing by our own rules, how do you separate the true rebels from the rejects?

 Justin Long is the latest poster boy for corporate anticonformity. As the star of Apple Computer’s “Get a Mac” campaign, he personified the hipness, ease of use and smirking superiority of the company by wearing Vans and poking fun at a stuffy, virus-prone nerd in a suit (i.e., the PC).  Now, in “Accepted,” which with all its glowing Apple logos functions as a feature-length Mac advertisement, Mr. Long further commodifies his dissent in that most oxymoronic of genres, the Hollywood comedy about sticking it to the man. He is Bartleby, a clever slacker rejected from college who, with the help of a geek (Jonah Hill), a babe (Maria Thayer), a weirdo (Adam Herschman) and a token black guy (Columbus Short), invents his own university in order to bamboozle his parents and bond with his fellow outcasts.  Classes offered at their South Harmon Institute of Technology  include Doing Nothing, Bumper Stickers, Wingman-ing and a surprisingly effective course in How to Blow Stuff Up With Your Mind. Soon enough, the uptight yes men of Harmon University start sniffing around and unleash the inevitable showdown between righteous Bartleby and the powers that be.  “Accepted” will make for a passable alternative to sold-out shows of “Snakes on a Plane,” but it’s a disappointing debut for the director Steve Pink. Best known for his savvy contribution to the scripts for “Grosse Pointe Blank” and “High Fidelity,” Mr. Pink does what he can with a screenplay by others, keeping his pep in a dumbed-down context and applying his good nature to half-hearted nonsense.  “Accepted” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The usual slacker shenanigans involving beer drinking, breast ogling and off-color talk.

Acceptable as a slab of teen-targeted summer fare, "Accepted" is a cheerfully implausible underdog comedy about several college rejects who invent a phony alma mater, only to find themselves paying way more than just tuition. Conceived in the same authority-defying, loser-uniting vein as a mainstream Richard Linklater picture, this glibly amusing paean to coed slackerdom may get docked some B.O. credits due to its late summer release from Universal -- opposite (gulp) "Snakes on a Plane" -- though youth biz should be brisk enough before it graduates into the world of homevid.
Clocking in at a weightless but far from witless 92 minutes, snappily executed pic reps the feature helming debut of Steve Pink, who co-wrote the John Cusack vehicles "Grosse Pointe Blank" and "High Fidelity." "Accepted," penned by the team of Adam Cooper, Bill Collage and Mark Perez, has a similarly slick way with dialogue, while its hyper-articulate hero suggests a younger prototype of one of Cusack's fast-talking charmers.
Bartleby Gaines (Justin Long, the gangly and likeable thesp from "Dodgeball" and "The Break-Up") is an Ohio teenager with lousy grades but a quicksilver ability to B.S. his way out of any situation. Faced with social ostracism and the disappointment of his parents (Mark Derwin and Ann Cusack) after being rejected by every college he applied to, Bartleby drafts a fake acceptance letter to the South Harmon Institute of Technology, the equally fake "sister school" of the illustrious Harmon College.
He even talks his best friend Sherman (Jonah Hill), a rotund nerd who's set to begin classes at Harmon College in the fall, into building a snazzy Web site for the phony institute.
When his parents insist on visiting the campus, Bartleby goes to ridiculously desperate lengths to maintain the illusion, obtaining the deed to a long-abandoned mental hospital ("Hope you have hobo stab insurance," Sherman mutters in one of the script's better lines), dressing it up as a place of higher learning and tapping Sherman's weird Uncle Ben (Lewis Black, gleefully off his rocker) to play the dean.
Joining Bartleby in this massive undertaking are fellow rejects Hands (Columbus Short), whose recent injury cost him an athletic scholarship; Rory (Maria Thayer), a Yale reject who neglected to apply anywhere else; and Glen (Adam Herschman), an all-around weirdo whose future looks to consist of a series of fast-food counters. But with the exception of Sherman, who benefits from Hill's sharp timing, none of Bartleby's friends emerges as a memorable second fiddle.
Things get even more out of hand when hundreds of flakes, freaks and former strippers find out about South Harmon and manage to gain admission via an online loophole. Forced to improvise, Bartleby and friends come up with the ultimate liberal education, in which lounging, skateboarding and nonstop partying are treated as serious subjects and students are encouraged to think for themselves (or not at all).
Providing a stiff contrast is Harmon College, whose rigidly traditionalist dean (snide bad guy extraordinaire Anthony Heald) sends golden boy Hoyt Ambrose (Travis Van Winkle) to investigate South Harmon.
Hoyt is also head of a Harmon fraternity, allowing pic to take a high and mighty attitude toward hazing rituals while planting the requisite seed of longing between Bartleby and Hoyt's girlfriend, Monica (Blake Lively).
Helmer Pink maintains a fluid pace and keeps the zingers flying so rapidly that the numerous plotholes -- where does everyone sleep? How could the creative masterminds behind such a charade not
 have gotten into college? -- nag only in retrospect. Even a running gag about the school's groan-worthy initials pays consistent comic dividends.
As a misfit-empowering comedy that embraces the stragglers and fringe-dwellers of teen society, "Accepted" is sweetly amusing, gently anarchic and never mean-spirited. But as it winds toward its final showdown between South Harmon and a state accreditation board, its attempts to make an inspiring, grand statement about mediocrity as a legitimate form of personal expression feel awfully threadbare.
Like Bartleby, the script has a talent for making hooey sound good. But pic falters when it begs to be taken seriously, especially when its portrayal of Harmon as a soul-deadening preppy wasteland tips over into sanctimony.
Long continues to cement his status as an improbably reliable leading man, carrying the comedy effortlessly with his extended verbal flights of fancy.
Well-chosen locations are nonetheless a far cry from Ohio: Orange County's Chapman U. stood in for Harmon, while South Harmon exteriors were shot at a veterans' affairs hospital in Northridge, Calif.

In director Steve Pink 's amiable but undernourished campus comedy, industrious high school underachiever Bartleby Gaines  (Justin Long ) gets rejected from every college under the sun. So he starts his own, the South Harmon Institute of Technology , complete with facilities (an abandoned mental hospital), faculty, and fully functional website where admission is, quite literally, a click away. Soon, S.H.I.T. becomes a mecca for all the huddled masses turned away by the legitimate university system. The joke, of course, is that the "fake" college is no worseand in some ways betterthan the high-ticket institute of higher learning down the road with its stuck-up faculty and humiliating frat-hazing rituals. But Accepted  is an inspired premise in search of a movie: What starts out as a scabrous takedown of academic bureaucracy ends up yet another modestly rousing underdog story about the little slacker that could. The cheat sheet in Pink's loose-leaf binder is Long, who's great fun to watch as he moves through the film with the shit-eating confidence of the kid voted most likely to succeed . . . at grand larceny.
