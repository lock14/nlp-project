You have to give the people cranking out these "Fantastic Four" movies credit. They know some of their audience extremely well. The early dilemma in "Rise of the Silver Surfer " (installment two, opening everywhere today) is this: Save the world or marry Jessica Alba . Your conscience says, "Save the world." But the Maxim reader in you knows better.
And so Reed Richards, the bio physicist with the elastic body, played by Ioan Gruffudd , proceeds to head down the aisle with his sometimes invisible girlfriend, Sue Storm, played by Alba. Meanwhile, the planet is engulfed in a major "global disturbance," in which the movie's special-effects department has fun creating massive conical orifices in such places as the dry bed of the Thames.
To be fair, Reed winds up building a device that tracks down the source of the disturbance. But that this movie would even try to drum up a dilemma for Reed, however comic, speaks to the dopiness of this flimsy series: it's "Yes, Dear" in tights.
The disturbance happens to be the Silver Surfer from outer space. He's part special effect, part dude in a suit -- to be precise, it's Doug Jones , who also embodied the demanding faun in "Pan's Labyrinth ." The Surfer rides a matching board, looks like a really fit SAG Award, speaks in Laurence Fishburne's voice, and has basically come in peace. He's only following orders to season Earth to be eaten by an omnipotent dust cloud, whom fans of the Marvel Universe -- and Fantastic Four issue #48, I believe -- will know as the entity Galactus. The Surfer and his own dilemma are a fine addition to this series. He exposes everything around him as shallow.
Could there be a more inconsequential superhero blockbuster than the Fantastic Four? These are flavorless, unbearably light movies, lighter than "X-Men ," "Superman ," "Batman ," and "Spider-Man ," lighter than paper, thinner than air. Lightness might be the filmmakers' mark of distinction, an antidote for the crises of identity and existence in those other movies. But the stakes are so intentionally low that there is nothing to care about. "Rise of the Silver Surfer" revels in the celebrity of its four heroes -- Reed and Sue's nuptials are "the wedding of the century"! But no one involved has the satirical chops to say anything witty or new.
The Marvel comic book this movie is based on was never as sitcom-ish as the two films it's inspired. "The Fantastic Four," with its quartet of earthlings turned superhuman, wed scientific data and family dynamics into a world of life-size concerns often played out on a galactic scale. The comic was rarely as ludicrous as it seemed or as it sometimes should have been. This made it square, but it made it solid, too. A fan could rely on its commitment to intelligent story arcs and absorbingly drawn action.
I suppose the only way to go with an expensive movie adaptation was to dumb it down, gratuitously set it in key international markets (the big showdown here is in China), and wink. But tongue scarcely touches cheek in these two movies, which Tim Story has directed with patchy fits of competence. For "Rise of the Silver Surfer," Julian McMahon, playing the thorn in the gang's side, Dr. Doom, goes for camp. He looks ready to burst into a number from "The Phantom of the Opera." But his one louche mood doesn't cut it.
As Ben "The Thing" Grimm, Michael Chiklis appears to have the hang of his bulky orange costume, but, if it's possible, his growling dialogue is more embarrassingly Kramdenesque than in the first movie. "I'll show you a rock slide" is yea-close to "To the moon!" His Norton is Chris Evans's Human Torch, and, like many fresh one-note character tics, his surprising conceited sarcasm from the first movie has stiffened into shtick. But he does raise some burning -- sorry -- questions about how Ben and his girlfriend (Kerry Washington, luminous but thankless again) manage to make love.
This leaves the rise of the Silver Surfer itself as the movie's only remotely interesting development. He causes the gang to switch powers occasionally, which is enjoyable. But it's his infinite sadness that sticks with you. This shiny, synthetic creature is more human than anyone else here. If he's smart, he'll ditch these chumps and ride that board into his own movie.

If you swept the cosmic dust of the superhero boom into a flimsy dustpan, you'd have the Fantastic Four  franchise. In Rise of the Silver Surfer , Marvel's serendipitously irradiated family must stop a massive, planet-eating plot device by unraveling the secrets of the Silver Surfer, a rapturous screensaver of a creation. He also doesn't talk much, which is a blessing: The dialogue aims young and low, and sounds translated from comic-book Esperanto.

 Given that the finest special effects in this crashing bore are Jessica Alba's pillowy lips, which look as if they could save lives in a 175-mile-an-hour car crash, it's no wonder some viewers might find themselves wishing that the promised end of the world might happen a bit sooner. At least there would be some bounce to go along with the big bang. Woe unto the impatient: it takes well over an hour before Armageddon comes knock, knock, knocking on the door to this particular hell, by which time the guy with the director's credit, Tim Story, has shown that he checked out the latest Superman movie before slapping together this amalgam of recycled ideas, dead air, dumb quips, casual sexism and pseudoscientific mumbo jumbo.  This existentially and aesthetically unnecessary sequel to the equally irrelevant if depressingly successful "Fantastic Four" reunites Ms. Alba's Sue Storm, a k a the Invisible Woman, with the insinuatingly rubbery Reed Richards, a k a Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd); the flaming Johnny Storm, a k a the Human Torch (Chris Evans); and that grumpy pile of rocks, Ben Grimm, otherwise known as the Thing (Michael Chiklis). Also collecting a paycheck (hello, new vacation home!) are Andre Braugher as an Army general with an expiration date stamped on his forehead and Laurence Fishburne, who voices the Silver Surfer, a sleek number that looks like a hood ornament and drops wisdom about the impending doom. Because he's anatomically correct save in one crucial regard, this dude clearly knows from personal catastrophe.  "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer" is rated PG  (Parental guidance suggested). It has modest action and major cleavage.

At a time when tortured superheroes like Spider-Man, Superman and Batman would benefit from some serious psychotherapy, it's almost refreshing to see a comicbook caper as blithe, weightless and cheerfully dumb as "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer." Faithfully mining one of the Marvel franchise's more intriguing mythologies, the sequel proves every bit as disposable as its predecessor, with even less character definition and several tons more poundage in the f/x department. Original grossed a surprising $330 million worldwide, and "Silver Surfer" should ride a heady wave of fan nostalgia and an audience-friendly PG rating to similarly golden returns.
It's always a drag when the threat of apocalyptic doom intrudes on one's personal life, as Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) are about to realize. Publicly known as Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, respectively, the Gotham scientists-turned-lovers are now planning a splashy celebrity wedding.
But to Sue's frustration, Reed is constantly distracted by reports of what appears to be a giant comet circling the globe, causing snowstorms, blackouts and all manner of meteorological mayhem. After a strike on New York disrupts the wedding (in the first of many set pieces entailing the destruction of buildings and aircraft), it's clearly a case for the Fantastic Four -- rounded out by Sue's reckless brother Johnny (Chris Evans), aka the Human Torch, and the rock-bodied, super-strong fighter Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis).
Villain turns out to be the enigmatic Silver Surfer, a metal-based intergalactic traveler (sonorously voiced by Laurence Fishburne) who's left a trail of dead planets in his wake. To stop the gnarly destroyer, the foursome will have to contend with a surly U.S. Army general (Andre Braugher) and, in an even more unpleasant development, the unsubtly monikered Victor Von Doom (Julian McMahon), having escaped his frozen captivity from the first film.
A gleaming marvel of 3-D animation, the Silver Surfer (who from certain angles resembles an iridescent shop manikin or a wicked-cool hood ornament) will deservedly command most of the attention here. Comicbook fans in particular will be pleased to know the character's mysterious origins and more-complicated-than-meets-the-eye motivations have been left gratifyingly intact, giving the pic a stronger narrative thrust than the first film's more straightforward origin story.
That somewhat offsets the sad fact that the Fantastic Four themselves have even less dramatic stature this time around, as scribes Mark Frost and Don Payne fail to develop them beyond the requisite one trait apiece. Thus, Gruffudd's Reed is still a lovable geek. Evans' Johnny is still a self-aggrandizing horndog. Alba's Sue is still, um, pretty. And Chiklis' Ben, the only figure who showed any semblance of a soul in the first place, is here reduced to belching comic relief.
To some extent, the noncommital perfs, lazy dialogue and retro-cheesy visual effects could be chalked up to the pic's refusal to take itself too seriously; one would be hard-pressed to recall the last time the apocalypse was treated this breezily onscreen. But at a certain point, even the most popcorn-hungry moviegoers may find themselves craving something in the way of real dramatic stakes. To defend "Fantastic Four" on the grounds that it is unpretentious is to make too generous an excuse.
Back in the director's chair, Tim Story ensures the pic's stylistic consistency with its predecessor, though the finale -- with its images of the Earth beset by cataclysmic forces -- suffers from visual bloat. F/x work overall is a mixed bag, lacking the polish and seamless integration most auds have come to expect from superhero extravaganzas.
Globe-trotting sequel could set a record for most international landmarks damaged in the course of a 1�-hour action movie, laying waste to the River Thames, the London Eye and the Great Wall of China, for starters.
