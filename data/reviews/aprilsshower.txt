         Exhibit No. 546 in the ongoing case against madcap ensemble comedies set against holiday- and wedding-related reunions, "April's Shower" crams a dozen one-note characters into a gloomy Los Angeles Craftsman for the express purpose of perpetrating yet another senseless zany-bomb attack on the assembled guests. The occasion is a bridal shower for April (Maria Cina), a closeted lesbian whose wounded former lover Alex (Trish Doolan, who also directs) has been cornered into hosting the shindig.
 
  Guests include a repressed therapist with a screaming Scottish stalker; a city-struck, pigtailed cousin from Albany; a porn-star future sister-in-law; a bisexual Argentine entertainer; a hunky pizza guy; a couple of publicly feuding lesbians; a distraught Catholic mother; some firemen — I think I'll stop there. Confessions, shocking revelations and epiphanies spring like sudden leaks, and the dialogue is artless and predictable. "April's Shower" is clearly a labor of love, to the point where it feels churlish and mean-spirited not to like it. But the movie suffers from a malady common to tiny indies of the let's-put-on-a-show variety — it strains for irrepressibly nutty, but lands squarely in annoying.
 


         






    It's too bad, given the paucity of truly independent films, especially ones that realistically portray contemporary relationships.
 
  But "April's Shower" feels too self-congratulatory to be honest, and honesty is all a movie like this has going for it.   


The joys of farce are fumbled in "April's Shower," star-director-writer Trish Doolan's arch and undernourished comedy about a bridal shower turned on its head by the bride's lesbian past. The antique premise (certainly as compared with the hip, urban cultural profile exhibited in the movie) has April (Maria Cina) willing to forsake her lesbian identity to marry nice Pauly (Randall Batinkoff) and thereby please her mom (Molly Cheek). But she insists on having her ex-lover Alex (Doolan) serve as maid-of-honor and host. Crowd-pleaser at undemanding gay-lesbian fests may receive a few bouquets from female-skewed cablers.
So much time is spent justifying the pic's set-up that the comedy never works up steam. As the guests pile into Alex's home, havoc is unleashed as Alex has a hissy fit and April's mom learns her daughter's true desires. Any genuine emotions get smothered in inept humor, typified by one confirmed lesbian character suddenly lip-locking with a stud delivering pizza. Pic is plagued by messy staging of ensemble scenes and relentlessly gauzy lensing.

Brokeback Mountain  may or may not be gay enough, but next to the middlebrow blandness of April's Shower , it's the pinnacle of audacity. This tepid lesbian comedy is named for a bridal shower, where either the host (writer-director Trish Doolan ) secretly loves the bride-to-be (Maria Cina), the bride herself is closeted, or both. In keeping with the dinner theater dramatics, the movie plants its two surprises at roughly 45-minute intervals. The guests have been allotted one trait eachcheerful, venal, pregnancy obsessed, Catholicand are played off each other in a kind of screenwriting shorthand. (Counterbalance comes in the form of equally dimensionless males: the gay best friend, the gee-whiz fiancé, and that old standby, the crazed Scotsman.) Sitcom pizzicato underlines each comic development. Everyone's sexual preference proves more pliable than seems plausible for a single afternoon. Over the course of the party, two women come out, a third thinks aloud that she might be gay, and a lifetime lesbian inexplicably starts bussing with the pizza guy. A bisexual stripper shows up to sort out the confusion, proving a far better therapist than the flummoxed therapist character.
