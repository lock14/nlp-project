         In David LaChapelle's enthralling "Rize," Tommy Johnson explains that he was working toward his goal of becoming a big-time drug dealer in South-Central Los Angeles when he was derailed by jail time, where he underwent a religious transformation and reappraised his life. Responding to the devastation and despair of the 1992 riots and answering a friend's plea to provide entertainment for her child's birthday party, Johnson was reborn as Tommy the Clown.
 
  A burly, outgoing young man, Tommy inadvertently unleashed a new dance phenomenon that he calls clowning, which in turn has given birth to an edgier, more aggressive freestyle form called krumping.
 


         






    With his baggy jumpsuit, rainbow wig and whitened face embellished with tiny red balloon designs, Tommy looks like a classic clown. But he discovered he is a veritable Pied Piper, reaching kids through dance, humor and affection.
 
  Through his street performances, party entertainments, dance competitions and myriad related activities, Tommy has laid the foundation for an alternative to gang life for countless young people.
 
  Having achieved success as a photographer, music video and commercials director and as director and designer of Elton John's "The Red Piano" show at Caesars Palace, LaChapelle now reveals he has the documentary filmmaker's gift for charting the evolution of a new form of artistic expression as a way of illuminating an entire world, that of South-Central Los Angeles, where people of goodwill continue to form a warm, mutually supportive community in the face of the omnipresent dangers of drive-by gang shootings.
 
  With Tommy as the film's anchor, "Rize" focuses considerable attention on the krumpers, especially the dynamic Dragon and the commanding Ms. Prissy. While Tommy is an entertainer, Dragon and his friends are attempting to connect intuitively with their tribal roots, to create identity and pride through an artistic expression that diffuses anger and frustration and transforms them into art.
 
  The spontaneity and energy with which the clowns and krumpers perform is breathtaking, and at one point LaChapelle intercuts a krumpers' performance with footage shot by Leni Riefenstahl of the ritual, often combative dances of Nuba tribesmen. The effect is startling in the similarities, although the designs the krumpers paint on their faces owe more inspiration to graffiti art than traditional African motifs.
 
  Throughout the film, there is the sense of individuals reaching deep within themselves to find ways of expression that will give meaning to their lives. The original music from Red Ronin Productions and Amy Marie Beauchamp and José Cancella's original score complement the tremendous wit, vitality and sensuality of the dancers.
 
  Dragon, born Jason Green, and his friends distance themselves from the commercial world of hip-hop and emphasize the purity of expression. Yet so dazzling are he, Ms. Prissy — Marquisa Gardner is her real name — and others that it's difficult to imagine that "Rize" is not bringing them unprecedented attention and opportunities. LaChapelle could well be already thinking of catching up with these engaging people several years from now.

In Rize , a documentary in which dance moves come close to looking like a declaration of war, the lean young ''krumpers,'' most of them impoverished men and women from inner-city Los Angeles, work their bodies into a wild state of such hectic gyrating motion that they look, literally, as if they're tearing themselves apart. There isn't a limb or a muscle group that isn't in full frenzy; it's dancing as cathartic seizure. Directed by David LaChapelle, the noted fashion photographer and music-video auteur, Rize  opens with ghostly black-and-white footage of the 1965 Watts riots, then video of the 1992 L.A. riots that emerged as a violent response to the Rodney King verdict. I thought I glimpsed the message  that krump, pioneered in the wake of the '92 riots, embodies the spirit of urban unrest. But then we're shown something that made my jaw drop: krumpers doing a barely stylized replay of the Rodney King video. A few of them take on the roles of cops, bearing down with invisible billy clubs, and the dancer in the middle is King  the hero rising, as if by a shaman's magic, from his pummeled stupor.
The impossibly fast, vibratory movements in Rize  may be familiar from videos (LaChapelle himself first encountered krump on the set of Christina Aguilera's ''Dirrty''), but in this case it's not just the booties that are jiggling. The entire body gets thrust in every direction at once. And here's the thing: The dancers are all, in movement and spirit, the resurrection of Rodney King. As the blows came down, King was forced to lie there, passive, a man stripped of all action and will. Krump dancing, as captured in Rize , is a fantasy of retaliatory power, rooted in the violent heart of Compton and Inglewood  a stylized revolt against impotence, against meeting the world lying down.
As long as it showcases the art of krump, underscoring the dancers with ominous hip-hop beats, Rize  is such a vibrant eruption of motion and attitude that you can forgive the film for being disorganized and too skimpy on street-dance history. We meet Tommy the Clown, the professional party entertainer who's credited with inventing krump, but we aren't given a vivid enough sense of what he created in '92 or how it developed in the hands of other performers over the next decade. That said, the Battle Zone V arena contest that provides the film with its climax could be the krumping version of Fight Club. It has the delirious force of a revival meeting that can't decide whether it's straining toward heaven or hell.
As this era's rough equivalent of the hip-hop docs Wild Style and Style Wars, Rize  makes you realize just how innocent and optimistic the break dancing of 20 years ago, with its rounded and symmetrical moves, now looks. Once again, though, I sense crossover potential: If the lives of '70s teen skateboarders or white trailer-trash rappers are worthy of dramatic treatment, why not a full-scale Hollywood fable about a dazzling young krumper who dances out his angst on the mean streets?

 "Rize," the new documentary directed by the fashion photographer David LaChapelle, begins with an unusual disclaimer: "The footage in this film has not been sped up in any way."  The reason for such reassurance soon becomes clear. Twenty-four frames per second, the rate at which film traditionally moves through a camera - and the speed at which, according to Jean-Luc Godard, cinema discloses the truth - seems too sluggish for Mr. LaChapelle's purpose, which is to record a form of dance that flourishes in some African-American neighborhoods in greater Los Angeles.  Called "clowning" or "krumping" - the terms refer to distinct but related styles - this kind of dancing is fierce, fast and frenetic, turning its practitioners into whirlwinds of flying limbs. Part of the pleasure of watching "Rize" is the sheer astonishment at their performances, which are shot and edited cleanly, with the focus on dance rather than movie-making technique.  Sometimes the dancers appear to have been possessed by angry spirits or set on fire, which in a sense they have been. This movie is, among other things, a celebration of the daemon of creative discipline and of the burning need for self-expression, community and pride.  That, at any rate, is how the clowners and krumpers describe what they do, and Mr. LaChapelle wisely lets them do most of the talking, rather than stepping in to interpret their experiences for us. He begins with images of urban upheaval - the Watts riots of 1965 and the Rodney King disturbances 27 years later - to establish that krumping is an art form that has arisen against a backdrop of poverty, violence and despair. These hard facts are never far from the minds of the dancers themselves, many of whom have joined clowning and krumping groups as an alternative to gangs. In the course of the film, one dancer, a 15-year-old girl named Quinesha Dunford (known as Lil Dimples) is killed in a drive-by shooting, and "Rize" is dedicated to her memory.  It is also dedicated to the exploration of an extraordinarily lively and complex subculture, though that sociological term seems a bit limiting. If this is not culture - art, family, sport, religion, friendship - then what is? Indeed, the movie sometimes has trouble living up to the richness of its subject, or keeping up with the dances' rapid spread and evolution. You may find yourself wishing that you could know some of the characters better and see more of their lives.  But in that case, there would be less time to watch them dance. At any rate, the stories and personalities that do emerge are touching and intriguing. "Rize" is dominated by Tommy the Clown, an energetic teddy bear of a man who is not shy about proclaiming himself the father of clowning.  He is certainly a patriarchal figure, serving as mentor, role model and guide for young followers, who help him entertain at neighborhood birthday parties. A former drug dealer who turned his life around in prison, Tommy is at once evangelist and entrepreneur, a civic leader and a local celebrity in pancake makeup and a gaudily airbrushed car.  Some of his protégés have become rivals, devotees of krumping, which one dancer describes as "the raw version" of Tommy's choreography (itself based on something called "the stripper dance"). Krumping is more physically confrontational and also overtly competitive - a matter of playground showdowns that combine the athletic bravura of street basketball with the stylized face-offs of hip-hop battles.  The film's climax is a battle, organized by Tommy, at the Great Western Forum, where clowns and krumpers compete in one of the most thrilling tests of skill since the rigged rap contest at the end of "8 Mile." That moment of triumph, though, is shadowed by a senseless off-screen crime, which serves as both a cruel reality check and a reminder of why this art form - and the dignity, freedom and glory it provides - is so necessary.  "Rize" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has suggestive content and language, drug references and brief nudity.
Kiddie birthday entertainment seems like an unlikely origin for the roughest, toughest new urban dance phenomenon, but such is the genealogy offered in Rize , fashion photographer David LaChapelle 's highly entertaining but underdeveloped documentary on clown dancing and krumping, two interrelated forms that emerged in the 'hoods of Los Angeles. The former began inauspiciously when a friend asked Tommy Johnson , the doc's default focal point, to don rainbow wig and face paint for a children's party in the days following the Rodney King  riots. His energetic and personable "hip-hop dancing clown" antics proved popular enough that Johnson, working under the nom de buffoon Tommy the Clown, spawned an unexpected cultural trend, eventually taking on a generation of young protégés and inspiring the formation of other clown crews, which in recent years number over 20 and provide a creative community alternative to the lure of gangs, drugs, and crime.
From this intergenerational seedbed of clownage sprang krumping, an aggressively virtuosic form of dance battling that serves as the visual raison d' for LaChapelle's documentary. Gyrating and popping so rapidly that they seem like break-dancers on fast-forward (opening titles stress that no video has been sped up), krumpers face off with the belligerent bravado of backyard wrestlers, micro-syncopating every body movement in an ever morphing flurry of astonishing corporeal control. The signature move is a hyperactive booty shake that engages the entire torso as an expressive instrument; according to interviewees, it evolved from a more sexualized Caribbean-esque grind called "the stripper dance." Traditional clown makeup transformed into asymmetrical warrior face paint that's itself a minor art form, individually composed of blue flames, starburst streaks, and other abstract motifs, more reminiscent of Ziggy Stardust  than Bozo.
Shot in a neo-vérité combination of generous performance footage and face-to-face interviews, Rize  stays mostly bereft of the hyper-real hard-candy stylization LaChapelle pioneered in his print work and music videos, saving such high-gloss methods for a slow-motion coda. Although Rize  demonstrates the aesthetic power and socially uplifting effects of "krumpness," like many documentaries about performers, it's hampered by its subjects' skill at playing to the camera. Few of the interviews get much further than recording surface boasts and assertive self-definitions; LaChapelle connects all their stories with common threads of resisting gang culture, but at the expense of flattening out each person's character.
This propensity leads to a particularly unfortunate sequence. Attempting to provide deeper historical background, LaChapelle suddenly cuts to what appears to be tribesmen dancing, wrestling, and face painting. Inserted to follow a statement from one performer that his skills simply came naturally, the footage appears without context or explanation. One suspects LaChapelle meant to offer an illustration of krumping's ultimately African roots, but in fact the anonymous tribesmen's dancing looks very little like that of the SoCal teens. It's as if a Martha Graham  documentary suddenly jumped to stock shots of traditional Irish jigging but left its argument at that. Far more remains unsaid about how krumping incorporates more historically recent gestures. Break dancing is given a brief nod, but even casual observers might recognize elements of electric boogaloo, capoeira, and ballet; one kid even high-steps a cakewalk.
While Rize  includes evidence of controversy surrounding Tommy the Clown's status as the grandfather of krump, there may be more to the story. The website for a recently released DVD called Get Krump , made with many of the same dancers featured in Rize , warns that "many characters and clowns are trying to take the credit away from the true source and founders." Get Krump 's producers explain that their documentary "is not a pity tale with the old song 'I dance because my alternatives are drugs and gang violence' but rather 'I dance because I am the best at it and you are invited to prove me wrong.' " Seems like the competition might not be over; Mr. LaChapelle, consider yourself served.
