Silly, inconsistent, and completely frivolous, Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby
 also happens to be one of the funniest movies this side of 2006. Director McKay (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy)
 returns with a paint-by-numbers plot and a star (Ferrell) performing well-rehearsed tricks. In spite of my yearning for new comedy ground, I can�t deny that there�s a good reason Ferrell is one of the most highly paid actors working today: He�s hilarious. Moreover, he successfully surrounds himself with outrageous, funny entertainers. Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a stock-car racer born to drive but lacking direction. Ricky only has eyes for No. 1, even at the expense of his best friend (Reilly). With his babe of a wife (the very funny Bibb), hellcat kids, and mansion, Ricky seems to have it all. But complications ensue when a French driver, Jean (Cohen), invades Ricky�s turf and takes over. With his childish expressions and doughy body, Ferrell manages at different times to be delicate, endearing, or completely over-the-top. Unafraid of surrealism or slapstick, he�ll clearly do anything for the joke but is often at his most hilarious when he subtly underplays a scene. Reilly is brilliant as Ricky�s best friend and No. 2 man; while in general his comic roles are few and far between, hopefully this turn marks a portent of things to come. Unfortunately, Cohen (Da Ali G Show)
, all thin cigarettes and incomprehensible accent, isn�t quite up to par as Jean, Ricky�s outed nemesis (though can anything top Cohen�s inspired alter ego, Borat?) � though the filmmakers do squeeze every possible joke out of the introduction of a gay racer. Richter, on the other hand, is underused, though hilarious, as Jean�s husband. As a boozy wife, Shannon is funny, but her performance is too brief, and Adams (Junebug
) has no real opportunity to demonstrate her incredible talent. Taking full advantage of Americana graphics and abundant visual opportunities, the first 20 minutes of the film sail along with hilarious glory, but when the story gets going, it becomes rapidly apparent that there won�t be any surprises in the plot department. While jokes are repeatedly used to cover up plot holes, the successful use of surrealist humor (Elvis Costello shows up for no real reason) compensates. Imagine attending a NASCAR race with the funniest, wildest person you know. Sure, you might get hot and a little overwhelmed, but you�d laugh a lot and would never regret the experience.


``Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby" is the sort of cheerfully asinine comedy that twists your arm until you submit. So, to Will Ferrell -- clown, freak, bully -- I scream, ``Uncle!" Ferrell co-wrote ``Talladega Nights" with the director Adam McKay. They also made 2003's TV news farce ``Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" together, and that arbitrarily amusing escapade was a warm-up for the more confident shenanigans they inflict on us here. The movie isn't a mean-spirited rag on NASCAR or its fans, though. It's a goof on the macho corniness of the racing movie.
Ferrell plays Ricky Bobby, a witless pit crewman who becomes a NASCAR superstar after his driver goes cuckoo. Fame does not improve Ricky's intelligence -- he and his trashy Dixie-chick wife (Leslie Bibb) name their sons Walker and Texas Ranger in praise of the old Chuck Norris show -- but it does afford the movie a chance to build a number of daffy sequences around the excesses the sport affords him.
The first 20 minutes come on fast and easy, whisking us from Ricky's speed-obsessed childhood to his sudden celebrity. There's the marriage, a few hilarious TV spots, fake interviews, a Motley Crüe song, and the tickling sight of Ricky driving a Wonder Bread-sponsored car. But the movie's been made with a surprisingly risky rhythm: That introductory blitz of jokes and gags settles into a single long scene at the Bobby family dinner table. Ricky tells us the meal has been sponsored by a certain energy drink, then he blesses the food, and an argument breaks out over which version of Jesus is better.
That meal goes on for several minutes more, and it underscores the noblest thing about ``Talladega Nights": that Ferrell and McKay are determined to see a scene through to its most unnatural conclusion. The dinner, with the tacky wife trying to maintain some order and the young'ns cussing poor grandpa, turns into a surreal set piece. Not much later, there is another at the bar where Ricky and his red-blooded American pals' country-loving good time is ruined by the jazz an accented stranger (Sacha Baron Cohen) plays on the jukebox.
His name is Jean Girard. He's gay, he's French, and he's just been hired to race by the same family that owns Ricky's team. He's capable of reading Camus and sipping wine while he drives, and his boyfriend is a vision of pomposity played by Andy Richter. The knee-jerk homophobia that would usually take over a dude comedy when someone like Jean arrives doesn't really surface. I'm thinking about the nosedives ``Wedding Crashers" took whenever its one gay character popped into view.
``Talladega Nights" is too slaphappy to annoy anybody, however. Cohen, who's better known to HBO subscribers as Ali G, gives Girard so many delightful curlicues (for one thing, his accent is not French; it's Peter Sellers) that the joke he makes of the character has numerous punch lines. One of the funniest shots in the movie is a close-up of Ferrell and Cohen in a nose-to-nose shout-down. You can see both men fighting the urge not to break character and collapse into hysterics.
The movie's generosity extends to nearly the whole cast. John C. Reilly plays Ricky's vividly dumb best friend, and while he's been funny before, I've never hurt laughing at him as I did here. Gary Cole and the unsung Jane Lynch have plum parts as Ricky's parents. Molly Shannon is tart in her few scenes, which, like a lot of moments in ``Talladega Nights," are glorified outtakes. Even Houston Tumlin and Grayson Russell, the two hellions playing Walker and Texas Ranger, are a blast.
Best of all is Amy Adams, that Oscar-nominee from ``Junebug," who here plays Ricky's drab assistant. She spends the movie in thankless group shots, then in one outrageous moment that feels ripped from a speech Nicole Kidman gave Tom Cruise in ``Days of Thunder," she comes to magic, comic life.
Naturally, the fleet, effortless marvels of the first 60 or so minutes prove unsustainable. After Ricky has a career-altering accident, the film becomes a lower-energy movie-of-the-week riff. This patch does produce one stellar hospital scene between Ferrell and Michael Clarke Duncan, as Ricky's pit-crew chief. Ferrell thinks he's paralyzed, Duncan tries to talk some sense into him, and the two men wind up tearfully screaming at each other in high Oscar-clip fashion.
A nonsense encounter like that is what makes ``Talladega Nights" so appealing. Not only is it the first comedy since ``The 40-Year-Old Virgin" that's been made with an improvisatory spirit and a degree of respect for an audience, it's also bravely poised on the fine edge between hilarity and disaster. Much of the credit belongs to Ferrell, who sets the picture's tone and is smart enough to surround himself with people who can follow his lead.
In the wrong hands (Nora Ephron's or Woody Allen's), Ferrell looks foolish because the directors are too in awe of his gangbusters style -- that or his status as a box-office lure. McKay, who was also a writer on ``Saturday Night Live," seems to have Ferrell's wild nature mostly under control. This is not to say the comedian doesn't go crazy. We are treated to the riotous, almost David Lynchian moment in which Ferrell runs around a motorway in his undies screaming that he's on fire. He's not. Actually, come to think of it: He is.


         "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby" is a bit of a mess, but it is a genial mess, and one that will make you laugh. Which is the whole idea.
 
  Even if you feel sheepish and abashed the next morning, it is hard to resist smiling at the antics of the NASCAR racing champion with two first names, a man, as the ads testify, "who could only count to #1."
 


         






    As co-written by star Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay (who has a cameo as a feckless race car driver), "Talladega Nights" is not the kind of coherent, internally consistent comedy "Little Miss Sunshine" is. Rather, like the "Saturday Night Live" shows where Ferrell and McKay met, it is a series of sketches and set pieces, some of which work while others misfire.
 
  "Talladega Nights" is also, like many of the modern crop of guy comedies, hampered by periodic descents into what the ratings board calls "crude and sexual humor." Given that the basic tone here is surprisingly sweet, these forays feel as though they were grafted onto a film that would have been better off without them.
 
  On the other hand, the idea of joining a satire of NASCAR culture with a spoof on self-help psychobabble of the "you have to make friends with the fear" variety is an especially potent one, and not that different in theme from what Pixar set out to do in "Cars."
 
  And not to forget the expert Mr. Ferrell, the master of an abashed, almost sheepish innocence that has roots all the way back to silent comedian Harry Langdon. There is a real sincerity to Ferrell's characterization, as there was in the earlier "Elf," an ability to take silly things so completely seriously that laughter inevitably results.
 
  Ferrell is also generous, and one reason "Talladega" is successful is his willingness to share the screen in mano a mano
 comedy standoffs with a trio of gifted male costars who can be just as funny as he is. In chronological order they are Gary Cole, John C. Reilly and Sacha Baron Cohen.
 
  Cole plays Ricky's reprobate father, Reese Bobby, a man so addicted to speed that his son ended up being born in a stock car. On a memorable elementary school Career Day, the only time Ricky had seen his father in years, Bobby Sr. passes on some words to live by: "If you ain't first, you're last."
 
  Reilly, a gifted actor who rarely does straight comedy, plays Ricky's lifelong friend and driving teammate, Cal Naughton Jr., a selfless soul who would very much like, if it's not asking too much, to win just one little race.
 
  Wackiest of all is British comic Cohen, a man who specializes in getting deeper than deep into his singular characters, people like rogue interviewer Ali G and journalist Borat Sagdiyev, the sixth most famous man in Kazakhstan.
 
  Cohen plays Jean Girard, a champion Formula One driver who is very very very French, to the point of enjoying jazz, wearing black leather, being sponsored by Perrier and reading Camus' "The Stranger" while he drives.
 
  Speaking English with an impeccably awful French accent, Girard also happens to be a gay man who enjoys crepes and has shown up in America specifically to challenge Ricky Bobby's supremacy. This is a clash that will rock the self-described "big hairy American winning machine" to his core and lead to such unforeseen consequences as delivering pizzas by bicycle and driving a car with a cougar for a passenger. Don't even ask.
 
  Though "Talladega Nights" is very much a guy comedy, it has found room for some sharp and amusing female roles. Leslie Bibb is all she should be as Ricky's glossy blond trophy wife, Carley; Jane Lynch stands up for comic sanity as Ricky's hardscrabble mom, Lucy Bobby; and Amy Adams, in a departure from "Junebug," plays Ricky's loyal assistant Susan.
 
  When the last race has been run, however, "Talladega Nights" belongs to Will Ferrell. He's created a voice and a physical look for Ricky Bobby, complete down to a soul patch under his lower lip that is both authentic and comic, and his ability to be amusing even when he doesn't appear to be doing anything is remarkable. For a film that feels like it has nearly as many lapses as the Talladega 500 has laps, a gift like that is irreplaceable.

Will Ferrell has a mission, if not an obsession  to celebrate, and satirize, the pumped-up folly of American manhood  and he has found a customized vehicle for it in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby . As Ricky, a NASCAR racer with major daddy issues who grows up nursing one thought (''I wanna go fast''), Ferrell uses his steady-silly baby-fat gaze and impervious ego to make gleeful fun of the tacky bravado of ''outlaw'' Southern car culture.
How arrogant a yokel is Ricky? He can't stop preening about his skills (''I wake up...and I p--- excellence!''), he's so greedy for sponsors that he plasters a Fig Newton decal on his windshield, and he turns the act of saying grace into a competitive sport. He also won't let his best friend, the boobish rube Cal (John C. Reilly), win a single race. Talladega Nights  takes some very funny cheap shots, especially when Ricky faces down his new team member  a gay, French, Camus-reading-behind-the-wheel Formula One driver played, with a leer worthy of Peter Sellers, by Sacha Baron Cohen.
A Will Ferrell blowhard must, of course, be brought down, and Talladega Nights  grows flakier and more uneven the lower Ricky falls. The races, however, are scorchingly shot, and they lend the movie a zest that was missing from Anchorman , Ferrell's last collaboration with director/co-writer Adam McKay. This one scores laughs right down to its gloriously gaga climactic smooch.

 For those still clinging to the notion that the United States is divided into Red and Blue,  Nascar and Hollywood would seem to dwell on opposite sides of the cultural divide. “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby” is hardly the first movie to challenge this simple-minded view of American popular culture — see also “Herbie: Fully Loaded,” “The Dukes of Hazzard” and of course “Cars” — but it does an admirably thorough job of debunking it.  After all, movies (and movie fans) have always had a soft spot for whining engines and screeching tires. But these days the deeper bond between auto racing and popular moviemaking lies in a shared passion for corporate sponsorship. The vehicles in “Talladega Nights” — which was made with the cooperation of Nascar — are covered with logos and brand names, and the movie itself may break new records for product placements per frame.  It’s all in fun of course. As a good-hearted spoof of the folkways of stock-car racing, the movie is happy to mock the sport’s eagerness to sell prime uniform and chassis space to sponsors like Perrier, Wonder Bread and Old Spice. It also is tickled at the eating habits of its fast-driving characters, who wash down Domino’s Pizza and Kentucky Fried Chicken with Coca-Cola and Budweiser and, when they want a high-end night out, head for the nearest Applebee’s. You can be sure that all these companies paid handsomely for the privilege of such lampooning, which even extends to the movie’s single funniest joke, a suppertime blessing brought to you by PowerAde.  Really, though, the brand that powers this ragged, intermittently uproarious fusion of sketch-comedy goofing and driving around in circles is Will Ferrell, who wrote the screenplay (with Adam McKay, the director) and served as an executive producer, in addition to running around on a race track in his underpants. He does a lot more than that, needless to say, but Mr. Ferrell’s willingness to strip down to his skivvies is one of his trademarks.  It is also a rare movie-star display of solidarity with those American men who, whether out of laziness or principle, disdain sunlight, proper nutrition, body-hair maintenance and abdominal exercise. Part of Mr. Ferrell’s appeal is surely that he is one of them. O.K., one of us.  He also has a genius for sniffing out pop-cultural fixtures and embodying them in a way that goes beyond easy, obvious parody. Like Ron Burgundy, the hero of “Anchorman,” Ricky Bobby is at once a creature of pure, extravagant absurdity and a curiously vulnerable, sympathetic figure. The son of a “semi-professional stock car racer and amateur tattoo artist” played by Gary Cole, Ricky is born in the back seat of a speeding Chevelle and goes on to glory on the  Nascar circuit. His sidekick and best buddy is Cal Naughton Jr. (John C. Reilly), a sweet, dim fellow content to come in second behind his pal. (Their motto, “shake and bake,” may be an honest homage to a popular product rather than a paid endorsement, but who really knows?) Ricky, by turns childlike and ferociously competitive, has some unresolved Daddy issues, which unfortunately weigh down the last third of “Talladega Nights” with perfunctory sentimentality.  Ricky and Cal are from North Carolina, home of the stock car king Richard Petty, and it requires no sensitivity training to recognize that they are stereotypes of a certain kind of Southern manhood. Not that anyone is likely to be too offended; from the old “Dukes of Hazzard” TV show to the songs of Toby Keith, caricature and Rebel pride tend to keep close company.  In any case the two good ol’ boys are soon confronted with a designated bad guy who incarnates an entirely antithetical stereotype — or, rather, invents a new one: the gay French Formula One driver. Jean Girard, as this nemesis is called, is played by Sacha Baron Cohen of “Ali G” fame with a demented sang-froid that suggests a synthesis of Peter Sellers and Pee-wee Herman. Mr. Cohen proves himself to be Mr. Ferrell’s equal and opposite, a comic dialectic sealed with the summer’s best on-screen kiss.    Like most movies of this kind, “Talladega Nights” is as good as its craziest riffs, which aren’t quite strong or various enough to fill out a whole feature. The funniest scenes have some of the improvised, pseudo-vérité flavor of Christopher Guest’s “Best in Show,” but Mr. Ferrell and Mr. McKay are less rigorous than Mr. Guest and his collaborators, preferring easy laughs to carefully turned comic insights. Still, at the high points — when Mr. Ferrell and Mr. Reilly start jawboning, when Leslie Bibb slyly steals a scene as Ricky’s frosty, gold-digging wife, when Mr. Reilly and Michael Clarke Duncan try to remove a fork from Mr. Ferrell’s thigh, or whenever Mr. Cohen opens his mouth — laughs are hard to suppress.  As a cultural artifact, “Talladega Nights” is both completely phony and, therefore, utterly authentic. Or, to put it differently: this movie is the real thing. It’s finger lickin’ good. It’s eatin’ good in the neighborhood. It’s the King of Beers. It’s Wonder Bread.  “Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Like any respectable country ballad, it has cussin’, fightin’, cheatin’ and drinkin’.

Simultaneously teasing and loving a subject doesn't make for easy comedy, but writer-star Will Ferrell and director/co-writer Adam McKay pull it off with good-ol'-boy good nature in "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby." NASCAR and its colorful melding of larger-than-life characters and action appear an ideal fit for Ferrell's onscreen persona, translating into terrific summer B.O. as fans of the left-turn-only circuit have a movie they can call their own.
Spoofing network affiliate news programs and officious, coiffed anchorpeople proved facile and obvious a targetin Ferrell and McKay's previous "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," but it appears the pair may be on to something in "Talladega."
NASCAR champ Ricky Bobby, like Burgundy, is at the top of his game and so egomaniacally aware of it, he's just asking to be brought down; he needs to have everything fall apart to realize what's worth living for. Ricky's collapse from glory may not quite add up when scrutinized too closely, but his scramble back to the track is flecked with enough humanity that it feels like a light ode to the idea that lives really can have second acts.
Urged on as a kid by his ne'er-do-well dad Reese (Gary Cole, magnificently crusty) with the motto, "If you're not first, you're last," Ricky finds himself in the pit crew of the Dennit racing team with buddy Cal (John C. Reilly), led by pit chief Lucius (Michael Clarke Duncan). When the blase Dennit driver refuses to let racing get in the way of a bathroom break, Ricky volunteers as replacement and wins the race in an upset.
In a swift montage, Rickey's legend takes off; he racks up wins and collects a fortune, along with obviously gold-digging trophy wife Carley (Leslie Bibb). It's too much too soon for Ricky, who's becoming as much of a monster as the two sons -- Walker (Houston Tumlin) and Texas Ranger (Grayson Russell) -- he and Carley are raising.
Trouble starts with the be-bop sound of Charlie Parker's "Segment" blaring out of the jukebox in Ricky's favorite dive -- the record of choice for champ Formula One driver Jean Girard (Sacha Baron Cohen), who enters like a Gallic hipster gunslinger and brazenly tells Ricky he will soon rule NASCAR like he's ruled "Formula Un." Girard throws a left hook into the movie just when it needs it, and Cohen's insanely funny dialect is inspired.
Ricky loses his mind, imagining, he's burned up in a crash and paralyzed from the waist down. With fear and defeat getting the best of him, Carley goes over to the enemy, leaving Ricky with the bratty boys and -- inexplicably -- no money. Taken in by his mom Lucy (Jane Lynch, about the only funny thesp in the cast with little to do), Ricky is made to confront the long-absent Reese, who tells his son to make fear his friend.
Girard is a comic character even Francophiles can enjoy (he peruses a Gallimard paperback edition of Camus' "L'etranger" while racing) and he's the worst nightmare for Ricky, a win-at-all-costs hick. But Ricky admirably overcomes his worst traits and learns to drive fast once more, even if Reese's methods to restore his son's nerve call for Ricky to drive with a live cougar in the passenger seat, illegal drugs under the engine and pursuing cops on his tail.
The new pic particularly laps "Anchorman" in characterization, with Ferrell and his supporting cast enjoying several scenes in which they can limn people beneath the funny banter. Ferrell takes a risk in pushing Ricky's most noxious aspects, with the reward that he also earns audience affection by playing a man who's humbled.
Reilly reveals Cal Jr. to be a quieter version of the ambitious Ricky, which is why a last-minute twist doesn't work for his character. After a deceptively discreet entrance, Amy Adams' shy assistant unleashes a stunning monologue that revs Ricky's inner engines. Duncan, Bibb and Greg Germann as the overcompensating heir to the Dennit racing biz brings NASCAR types to life. (In fact, several NASCAR stars have cameos in the film, including Dale Earnhardt Jr.)
Not only does McKay display a strong grip on his actors and camera, he gets the grit, heat and feel of NASCAR racetracks with a near-documentary sensibility. This is perhaps the pic's most surprising dimension, aided by Oliver Wood's ace widescreen lensing, and CG racetrack and car crash effects. It's enough to make Jerry Bruckheimer envious.

There is no modern-day antecedent to the movies Will Ferrell  makes with writer-director Adam McKay , with whom Ferrell collaborated during their tenure at Saturday Night Live  . To compare their offerings, Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy   and the new Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby , to the oeuvres of Adam Sandler  or the Farrelly brothers  would slight those films. So where does that leave them? Somewhere in the 1930s, as spiritual heirs to the throne abandoned by the Marx Brothers . The films of Ferrell and McKay play like potty-mouthed throwbacks to the anarchic slapshtick of Groucho, Chico, Harpo, and even Zeppo.
Talladega Nights  might as well be titled A Day at the Races . Like Anchorman , with which it shares its essential plot of a celebrity humiliated and redeemed and an obsession with Ferrell's pale paunch, Ferrell and McKay's latest has just enough story to justify being labeled a narrative. But the tale of Ricky Bobby  (Ferrell, of course), an abandoned kid who grows up to be a famous NASCAR  driver, is beside the point. It's just the watered-down glue that keeps the movie from playing like a series of sketches in which grown-ass men do dumbass-kid stuff for nearly two hours. There are two kinds of scenes here: the short ones that advance the storyline, and the prolonged sequences in which Ferrell and/or John C. Reilly  (as Ricky's best friend, the whitest-trash Cal Naughton Jr.)  and/or Sacha Baron Cohen  (as Ricky's rival, French fancy boy Jean Girard ) make shit up and crack each other up and stop the cameras and start all over again. There's no difference between the movie and the end-credit outtakes.
Ferrell may be no Groucho Marx  and McKay, no George Kaufmanbut, like his predecessor, he works best in projects constructed around him. Just when it appeared he was content to be squandered in ill-fitting disasters, from Bewitched  to Curious George  , he reminds the audience of why he matters: because he's the loudest, driest, and most fearless comic actor working. Once more he strips to his undies and gallops around as he did in Old School , but here it goes on and on till it becomes its own subplot.
Still, McKay and Ferrell imbue this shallow nonsense with some wink-wink depthor at least try. That's why Amy Adams  is there as Ricky's personal assistant and eventual love interest; that's why deadpan whizzes Gary Cole  and Jane Lynch  are there as Ricky's parents; that's why Reilly's there as the best friend who betrays his pal without knowing how or why. It doesn't mean anything the tale of woe and whoa, but it's nice to know there's an effort to keep the car on the track. Because without the chassis, you're just spinning your wheels.
