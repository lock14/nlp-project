         There are no millions in "Millions," but to two small boys in the north of England who come across exactly 229,320 pounds in a large Nike bag, the amount of cash may as well be that large. It's a bigger-than-life amount of money, and the problems and joys it brings with it are the focus of this lively and most unlikely film, a sweet-natured fable told with a whimsicality all its own.
 
  "Millions" is unlikely not just because of its plot but also because neither director Danny Boyle nor screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce has done anything quite like this before.
 


         






    The idea started with Boyce, who, as the father of seven, had no trouble responding to a producer's suggestion that he attempt a film about children, even though his body of work was largely serious stuff such as "Welcome to Sarajevo" and "Code 46."
 
  As the director of edgy, rapid-fire films such as "Trainspotting" and "28 Days Later," Boyle sounds like the last person you'd want to entrust with a story like "Millions," a parable about love, faith, materialism and the difficulty of doing the right thing.
 
  But, in something very much like the miracles "Millions" deals with, Boyle's slick video style and affinity for loud music have proved a high-energy addition to Boyce's story, livening it up without corrupting its intrinsic charm.
 
  This visual energy is visible from the film's opening, with two brothers — 7-year-old Damian (Alex Etel) and 9-year-old Anthony (Lewis McGibbon) — riding their bikes to the under-construction housing development they'll soon be moving to. In a trice, thanks to stop-motion photography, the walls rise from the ground and the building is ready for occupation.
 
  The boys' family, however, is an incomplete one: their mother has recently died and they and their father, Ronnie ("Bloody Sunday" star James Nesbitt), are trying different strategies for coping with this disaster.
 
  While Anthony soon figures out that losing a mother is an opportunity to hit up strangers for free sweets, Damian is going another way. In the film's central and most irresistible conceit, the lad receives a constant stream of visits from long-dead saints.
 
  Damian knows these folks so well, he not only recognizes them instantly (granted, their halos are something of a giveaway), but he has memorized their vital statistics and uses them as part of a greeting, as in "Francis of Assisi, 1181 to 1226" and "the Martyrs of Uganda, 1881."
 
  Damian is in fact hanging out in his cardboard playhouse near the town's rail lines with "Clare of Assisi, 1194 to 1223," otherwise known as the patron saint of television, when that bag of money arrives out of thin air. Worried about his history of imagining things, he shows the loot to his brother to make sure it's real. Anthony thinks it likely came from a robbery, but Damian is sure it must be from God.
 
  After all, he reasons, "who else would have that kind of money?"
 
  Adding an element of urgency to disposing of the treasure and underlining to audiences how fantastical this is, the bag arrives just before Britain's only imagined currency switch from the pound to the euro, which would make the loot worthless in a few days.
 
  After ever-practical Anthony persuades his brother not to turn the money in to authorities because of the tax bite, most of "Millions" is taken up with the boys' amusingly conflicting ideas of how to dispose of it all.
 
  While Anthony yearns for investment property, Damian, like the saints he idolizes, only wants to do good and "help the poor." His attempts to find said poor, involving homeless people with a yen for pizza as well as Mormon missionaries with a weakness for materialism, are exquisitely done.
 
  The film's entire cast, including Daisy Donovan as a woman who catches Ronnie's eye and Christopher Fulford as a Bill Sykes-type bad guy, give expert performances. But "Millions" isn't even imaginable without the wonderful debut performance of young Etel as Damian, a baby-faced moralist who periodically breaks into smiles you have to love.
 
  Etel plays a deadly serious little guy who is such a complete naif that he literally cannot tell a lie, yet his commitment to this daft scenario is so complete that we are compelled to believe it's all happening. Despite being a pure fantasy that relishes not making literal sense, "Millions" retains a conviction about what it's doing that makes us believe and enjoy.

Millions  could eventually become a perennial DVD holiday favorite  a major factor, I'd like to think, in the contrarian plan to premiere director Danny Boyle's sparkling new family movie now, in this drab, uncelebrated, nonsectarian, late-winter season, when we need it more. Consider: The twinkly hubbub of Christmas comes but once a year, but the call to do the right thing in the face of material temptation is a daily appointment. Plus: Although Millions  culminates in December on a patch of northern English suburbia where a kiddie Nativity pageant derails with fantastic consequences, the bright star that appears in the night sky to guide a little boy barely gets a nod.
Come to think of it, evocations of everyday boyhood, with its blur of the ordinary and the magical, are where Boyle has always excelled. I think a similar feel for the cinematic possibilities of laddie gusto links the raving, toilet-diving junkies of Trainspotting  with the foaming, flesh-devouring zombies of 28 Days Later . And while the selected Catholic saints who make appearances in Millions  neither rave nor foam  on the contrary, shot with matter-of-fact radiance by Dogville cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, they are the gentlest and most inspirational of fellows  Boyle treats them with similar receptiveness, curiosity, and good humor. Indeed, Boyle's unflappable enthusiasm gives this blithe original story by Frank Cottrell Boyce (a frequent collaborator with Michael Winterbottom and, by the way, a father of seven) its extra bounce of Mad Hatter charm.
Following the death of their mother, spiritually receptive 7-year-old Damian (impish newcomer Alex Etel) and his more hardheaded 9-year-old brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), move to a new home with their father (Bloody Sunday 's James Nesbitt), where each adapts to loss and sadness in his own way. The consumer-oriented Anthony experiments with milking pity from strangers (telling any woman of his orphan status always pays off); Damian works on elevating his mum to the rank of the saints he loves reading about. Then temptation falls from the sky, literally, when a bag crammed with cash shows up, as if by a miracle, at the hideaway in the wild reeds that Damian has built out of discarded packing boxes. The cash is in British pound notes, by the way. The country is about to convert to Euros.
The money that fell from the sky in Sam Raimi's bleak corker A Simple Plan  warped the lives of grown men. That the burden of responsibility  and possibility  falls to kids in Millions  is just one of the great twists put to such satisfying use, while Dad (a good parent, managing his own sorrow) does the best he can by offering a new beginning for the boys in a new home. Make no mistake, Millions  is still a Danny Boyle film, where absurdity is an everyday occurrence and what takes places inside a guy's head fights for shelf space with what's happening in the outside world. But this sincere, delicate, and intrinsically religious comedy may also become that most unexpected of blessings  Danny Boyle's first family classic.

hen it comes to making movies, the English director Danny Boyle is usually up to no good, which is something this visual stylist does with great ostentatious flair. Best known for "Trainspotting," a grungy entertainment about the gleefully down and out, memorable for its E-is-for Ecstasy flourishes and the hallucinatory vision of a creepily crawling dead baby, and, more recently, for the shiver-filled zombie flick "28 Days Later," Mr. Boyle is the sort of creative type in whom the milk of human kindness often seems to curdle rather than flow. Given the gaudy violence that frequently moves Mr. Boyle's stories forward and keeps them jumping, and the enjoyment he appears to derive when push leads to shove in those stories, it may come as something of a surprise that the filmmaker has handily cleared a new hurdle: he has directed a heartfelt, emotionally delicate children's movie about life and death and all the parts in between. Pegged to a lonesome little boy, a motherless child named Damian (Alex Etel, making a sensational film debut), "Millions"is about the secret world of children, in particular that miraculous, tragically brief interlude when the young imagination - not yet captive to crippling adult conventions like time, space and rational thought - takes boundless flight. Principally set in and around a new ticky-tacky housing development in an anonymous suburban wasteland, the story hinges on what happens - the good, the bad and the scary - after a sack stuffed with money literally lands on its 7-year-old hero. Along with his older brother, Anthony (Lewis McGibbon), and father, Ronnie (James Nesbitt), Damian has moved into new digs, mostly, it seems, because their old home is where once upon a time they lived with a loving wife and mother. Recently deceased, the missing woman hangs over this woeful threesome like a sigh. Her absence shapes their days and nights, driving Ronnie to cuddle the pillows in his big empty bed and sending his children deep into worlds of their own making, one shaped by pre-adolescent tremors, the other by ecstatic faith. Mr. Boyle is a master of gimmicks, narrative and visual; like a good pop musician, he believes in the power of the hook, a catchy bit to reel you in.  With  "Millions," that catchy bit isn't the errant bag of cash or the stranger who, shades of "Great Expectations," ominously emerges from the wilds to haunt the boys and kick-start the plot. The hook is that  Damian believes he is on speaking (and seeing) terms with saints whose tribulations he knows the way most  children know the stats of their favorite football players. A gravely beautiful child, with a face splashed with freckles and pooling eyes, the young actor brings to the role the strange ethereality of those children who never fit in to the here and the now but curl into their own private worlds, giggling at jokes no one else hears. Happily for the film and its infectious sense of fun, the character is also a pip. Invariably the odd kid out, the one who clings to the schoolyard wall at recess while the rest of the gaggle scream and shout, Damian keeps us engaged less because he greets St. Peter like a long-lost relative, than because he registers as wonderfully real. After the bag falls from the sky, Damian brings the practically minded Anthony for a peek. "You can see it, too?" he anxiously asks of the loot. Damian may have an overactive imagination (then again, Mr. Boyle slyly suggests, maybe not), but he's also self-aware enough to know that St. Clare of Assisi, who drops by his cardboard playhouse to steal a smoke, is no ordinary imaginary friend. "Millions" was written by Frank Cottrell Boyce, who has a raft of groaningly heavy credits to his name, including a handful of features directed by that other British film chameleon, Michael Winterbottom ("Butterfly Kiss," "The Claim"). That r�sum� may not inspire high hopes, but Mr. Boyce also wrote the psychologically pitch-perfect "Hilary and Jackie" and the eager-to-please "24 Hour   Party People"; the first showed he can do serious without succumbing to lugubrious,  while the second proves he knows how to laugh. His screenplay for "Millions" taps the writer's strengths and shows a rare respect for  pint-sized characters. One of the pleasures of the film is there's never any doubt that this soulful child feels as deeply as any adult: Damian may be a squirt, but he is also an existential hero. Much of the movie's other pleasures are visual. As he did in "Trainspotting" and "28 Days Later," Mr. Boyle uses all manner of enjoyable tricks to show us what his characters see; more poignantly, he also shows why Damian takes such delight in being alive, despite his crushing loss. "Millions" has plenty of story and characters to chew over, including a sweetheart for Ronnie, Latter-day Saints and train robbers, a boogeyman and all those peripatetic martyrs. But more enjoyable still is a dream house that goes up lickety-split and clouds that scud overhead like bunnies. At the core of this unexpectedly moving film is a serious child (and just maybe a reformed cynic) who with heart and eyes open embraces a credo once spat out by an older, rather less wise soul in "Trainspotting": choose life. "Millions" is rated PG (Parental guidance is suggested). The loss of a mother may upset some children; the film also contains mild violence, adult language and the discreet suggestion of adult sexuality.

A correction was made to this review on Sept. 21, 2004.
A contempo Christmas fairy tale for the CGI generation, Brit director Danny Boyle's "Millions" maintains a bankable charm and innocence even when overdrawn on the special effects side. Eccentric laffer, about two pre-teens who stumble on a stash of cash, is like "A Life Less Ordinary" relocated to a 'burb in northwest England but with "Amelie's" visual vigor and sustained magical realism. Sparky but essentially small movie could do reasonable numbers with a wide swathe of auds if positioned clear of heavyweight crowd-pleasers. U.K. release is Dec. 3.

Set before Christmas but shot in summery locations, pic's unreal atmosphere is underlined from the start as two brothers, 9-year-old Anthony (Lewis McGibbon) and 7-year-old Damien (Alex Etel, in pic's casting coup), move to a brand new housing development on the edge of Liverpool following the death of their mom (Jane Hogarth, only seen at end). In an orgy of exhilarating CGI, similar to the start of Li Shaohong's Beijing-set "Baober in Love," the houses literally spring up around the kids as they celebrate the beginning of a new life with their father, Ronnie (James Nesbitt), and away from the grim inner city.
While Anthony is a savvy mathematician with a businessboy's brain, Damien is a dreamer fixated on saints, miracles and the world of imagination. Damien is building a hideaway out of packing boxes near the railroad -- and hosting his first "guest," a joint-smoking St. Clare (Kathryn Pogson) -- when a bag stuffed with banknotes arrives through the air .
For the naive Damien, it's a miracle from God. For the practical Anthony, it's a £229,320 ($411,662) windfall that could be taxed at 40% if they declare it. Both agree to keep it a secret, though when St. Francis of Assisi (Enzo Cilenti) appears to Damien and tells him to help the poor, the kids find that easier said than done.
After this powerhouse opening half-hour, pic momentarily turns a little darker as a sinister-looking pauper (Christopher Fulford) turns up at Damien's hideaway demanding money. Anthony's presence of mind gets them out of that tangle, but there's no escaping a looming bigger problem: Blighty is finally about to join the Euro (film is set in an imaginary near future) and in little more than a week's time the sterling is going to be as worthless as Monopoly money.
Soon, a chipper young charity worker, Dorothy (Daisy Donovan), starts taking an interest in father Ronnie and -- to the boys' minds -- the money, which turns out to be have been dumped from a train by bank robbers. All that's left is to somehow spend the loot, but the police have already been alerted and the pauper is again hot on their trail.
After the early stages, film fortunately goes easier on the visual effects and concentrates more on character and story-telling, with scripter Frank Cottrell Boyce (a regular collaborator with Michael Winterbottom, and one of the U.K.'s most imaginative writers) keeping the thin plot alive with setbacks and left turns. Ending is simple and briefly affecting, with the moral of the tale ("money just makes everything worse") spelled out but in lower case.
Dialogue by the kids has a slightly out-there, proto-adult flavor that's handled with great assurance by both McGibbon and the younger Etel, with the latter practically stealing the film with his northern English blend of earthy cute.
Other roles are equally carefully calibrated to maintain the movie's irreal atmosphere, with the adults, as in all fairytales, having a simple, one-dimensional flavor (upbeat Dorothy, kindly Ronnie, scary pauper) that keeps the emotional focus tightly on the youngsters. Nesbitt and Donovan are excellent in this regard, and Pearce Quigley, as a bureaucratic-speak community cop, stands out among the adult supports.
Tech package is aces at all levels, with key talent drawn from Boyle's "28 Days Later" and his prior BBC telepics ("Strumpet," "Vacuuming Completely Nude in Paradise," whose antsy style "Millions" often recalls). Danish lenser Anthony Dod Mantle, who also worked on a slew of Dogme movies, creates a semi-magical, semi-realistic landscape of heightened colors and summery hues, in tandem with production design by Mark Tildesley, also a regular Winterbottom collaborator . John Murphy's score keeps the movie at a brisk pace, in tandem with Chris Gill's crisp cutting.

Danny Boyle 's Millions  is not what we'd expect from the Trainspotting  and 28 Days Later  director. It's essentially a gentle, kid's-eye parable: A motherless, saint-hallucinating young boy, Damian (Alex Etel ), finds a Nike  bag stuffed with ill-gotten gainshundreds of thousands of pounds sterlingwhich he endeavors to distribute to the needy, a group that proves hard to come by. (He treats a pack of crunchy save-the-world types to pizza, and leaves cash for the electronics-deprived Mormons down the block.) Contaminating his plan is slightly older brother Anthony (Lewis McGibbon ), who splurges on gadgetry and urges Damian to invest in real estate, and the knit-capped man (Christopher Fulford ) who menacingly demands his loot back. A further wrinkle: Britain is about to switch from pound to euro, meaning that everything must be spentor converted without drawing suspicion.
The plot trigger of cursed discovery suggests A Simple Plan   and Stand by Me . As the altruistic, freckled Damian, Etel mostly stays on the right side of the adorable/annoying line. Damian's the opposite of his namesake from The Omen , siding with the angels instead of the lord of darkness. Saints Clare, Peter, Francis, Nicholas, and Joseph all make appearances, advising our young hero. It's a logical flight of fancyhow to explain the mind of a child who wants to give rather than get?that still feels contrived.
Some Boyle fingerprints are discernible early on. When Damian and Anthony visit the lot where their new home will go up, the timbers sprout and walls materialize in a time-lapse fantasy, which turns out to be the real thing. And the bag of dough, when first seen, is startlingly unidentifiable, leaping across the landscape as though equipped with rockets.
