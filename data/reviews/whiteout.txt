In its early scenes, “Whiteout’’ feels like it’s setting us up for an Antarctic “Alien.’’ There’s the scientific base far, far from civilization; there’s Kate Beckinsale nonsensically stripping down to her tighty-whities just like Ellen Ripley; there’s something spooky in a box; there’s even Tom Skerritt, the interstellar captain of “Alien,’’ as Doc, sawbones of Camp Amundsen-Scott at the South Pole.
At this point, the parallels stop cold. Based on a much tauter graphic novel series, “Whiteout’’ is a ham-handed murder mystery that starts out average and heads south from there, falling apart under the pressures of graceless camerawork, leaps of illogic, and TV-movie production values.
The setting is novel, at least, and “Whiteout’’ fits neatly into the new forensic-pathology chic. Beckinsale plays a US marshal named Carrie Stetko but she could just as well be Dr. “Bones’’ Brennan for all the ghastly dead bodies she uncovers. The first has apparently been thrown from a plane. The second has his throat cut. Carrie’s very nearly the third.
Who is killing the geologists of the Antarctic? It has something to do with the contents of that box, buried under the ice in a Russian transport plane that crashed back in 1957. (If you’re hoping for something supernatural, don’t hold your breath.) Carrie investigates with the aid of Doc, a raffish pilot (Columbus Short), and a “special UN investigator’’ played both smugly and woodenly  - no mean feat  - by Gabriel Macht (“The Spirit’’).
Beckinsale is her usual lovely and brittle self, but it says something about this capable British actress that she can go slumming in the funkiest of genre films  - the “Underworld’’ series, the tatty motel horror film “Vacancy’’  - without ever appearing to enjoy herself. Why does Beckinsale keep taking these roles? That’s a greater mystery than anything on the screen.
After some decent opening banter and a few interesting tracking shots through the base station, “Whiteout’’ settles into a rut of barely acceptable professionalism. Director Dominic Sena (“Swordfish’’) fails to combine the film’s elements into a coherent whole, which, when you think about it, is what directing fundamentally is. Chris Soos’s camerawork is overwrought; you can’t tell who’s doing what to whom during the indoor scenes, and forget about the snowstorms. John Frizzell’s score is strictly hourlong television drama.
Worse, the characters keep walking into crime scenes and figuring out exactly what happened based on the most tenuous physical evidence; the low point (or high point; take your pick) comes when Carrie accurately reconstructs a complicated gun battle based on a pile of frozen 50-year-old corpses. There’s insight, and then there’s bad screenwriting.
The resolution is especially disappointing; a straight-up B-thriller like this shouldn’t make audiences feel like they’ve wasted their time. “Whiteout’’ fritters away its suspense, its setting, and our indulgence. You come away wishing someone had applied White-Out to the script.

How cold is it in Antarctica? Cold enough for hands to freeze  but lips to remain kissing soft. Or at least that's the bad news/good news for Kate Beckinsale as a comely U.S. marshal at an ice-encrusted American research station, investigating a homicide when not battling flashbacks of Something Bad that once happened to her in Miami. Whiteout  is a conventionally jam-packed, dutifully ludicrous action thriller, based on a graphic novel, which features the lithe marshal in a steamy shower and a chase scene in zero-degree visibility (the bad guy wields a scary pickax). As a bonus, a team of screenwriters devised a prologue involving those sturdiest of menaces  1950s-style Russians swigging vodka. Ah, but are they merely red herrings?

 The first thing Kate Beckinsale does in “Whiteout” is take a shower. This may be because her character, a United States marshal named Carrie Stetko, needs to rinse off the grime of Antarctica, where she is stationed. Or, as seems more likely, it may be because the filmmakers, realizing that she would be spending most of the movie swaddled in thick parkas and layers of thermal protection, felt that some audience members might enjoy seeing Ms. Beckinsale in her underwear and then out of it behind a strategically fogged glass door.  Which is not to imply that the shower scene, interrupted by a knock at the door — “I’m in the shower,” Carrie cleverly replies — is more contrived or absurd than anything else that happens in this studiously mediocre little thriller, which was directed by Dominic Sena. In the opening sequence a Soviet transport plane crashes in the ice, and a half-century later bodies start turning up. Carrie, a few days before she’s supposed to leave the research complex, investigates, menaced by an impending storm and interrupted by flashbacks to some bad stuff that went down, earlier in her career, in Miami.  Up   there, by the way, she could work in a sleeveless T-shirt. At her current post she loses two fingers to frostbite, gasps in surprise when something surprising happens, and takes turns with other characters at explaining what is happening. We’re stuck! It’s cold! Jelly beans!  The major question that keeps the movie moderately engaging is which of the men around Carrie will turn out to be one of the bad guys who go around hacking up geologists with an ice ax. Will it be the friendly pilot (Columbus Short), who accompanies   her  to remote encampments? Will it be the United Nations investigator (Gabriel Macht) who turns up at one of them? The kindly old doctor, known as Doc (Tom Skerritt)? That Australian guy (Alex O’Loughlin)? Or that other guy (Shawn Doyle)?  No spoilers here! Though if you study the cast list you may develop an inkling. But the way “Whiteout” walks the line between implausibility and predictability is neither unusual nor in itself a problem. The problem lies in the movie’s perfunctory, by-the-numbers approach to the story and its characters. That the climactic blizzard-obscured action sequence is tedious and confusing does not help.  And shouldn’t there be penguins? I thought every movie about Antarctica had to have penguins. Has someone done market research proving otherwise? Is the whole penguin thing over? Or maybe the penguins read the script and told their agents to pass. Smart birds.  “Whiteout” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Violence, swearing, a gratuitous shower.

Its stunning natural landscape notwithstanding, Antarctica-set thriller "Whiteout," a frozen concoction of red herrings, incongruous plot points and thinly developed characters, will leave auds cold. It's tough enough for a female lead to sell an action thriller, and not even the "Underworld" legions drawn by Kate Beckinsale, here playing a U.S. marshal tracking a killer, will be able to make up for the chilly reception likely to be afforded this Dominic Sena-helmed pic, which should fade faster than a polar bear in a blizzard. 
Originally published in 2001, Greg Rucka and Steve Lieber's taut graphic novel featured the tenacious Marshal Carrie Stetko and blonde British agent Lily Sharpe trying to solve a murder at a South Pole research outpost. The movie, which changes some key players and plot points, starts with a bang, as a Russian plane carrying secret cargo plummets in a spectacular snowy crash. All aboard are killed. Flash forward to the American base that Stetko patrols. But the screen Stetko is far less credible than her tough-as-nails print incarnation.
It doesn't help the character's credibility that our introduction to her -- after a lengthy tracking shot setting up the base -- involves a steamy shower scene whose net effect is to remind the (presumably male) audience that the actress is in fantastic shape, although Beckinsale's near total lack of body fat would arguably render Stetko a dubious candidate for a post in the frozen wilderness. That's the last bit of visible skin, however; Stetko and colleagues spend most of the movie buried under layers of thermals and fleece.
Just days away from ending an uneventful two-year stint in Antarctica, Stetko snaps into action when a body turns up. It's the first recorded murder in Antarctica, and though she apparently can't eye a corpse without reliving (in color-saturated flashbacks) a painfully botched past arrest, she's a woman on a mission.
But what's curious about Stetko's determination to solve the mystery is that it's so at odds with Beckinsale's low-key interpretation. Rather than being excited by the chase or driven by an intrinsic need for justice, she spouts dialogue that even she doesn't seem to believe. Her presumed motivation -- to expunge the memory of this past blunder -- never really feels authentic.
Supporting cast includes Tom Skerritt as Stetko's avuncular pal Dr. John Fury, Gabriel Macht as a U.N. official (replacing the graphic novel's agent Sharpe) who might also be a love interest; Columbus Short as a spirited airplane pilot and Alex O'Loughlin as a sassy Australian. The script, credited to two pairs of brothers (Jon & Erich Hoeber and Chad & Carey Hayes), appears to have been pummeled to the point where some lines inadvertently yielded snickers and groans.
It's too bad, because on a technical level, "Whiteout" has its assets.
It must have been no picnic filming in tricky conditions against a white-engulfed backdrop (Manitoba convincingly stands in for Antarctica) and Chris Soos' lensing makes the territory seem both menacing and beautiful. Wind-whipped action scenes in which characters cling desperately to guide lines as they fight an ice-ax wielding villain are compellingly staged --though composer John Frizzell's overwrought score announces every terrifying gesture.
