Indy may be older, but the new film recaptures the franchise's youth
No, it's not as good as "Raiders of the Lost Ark." Don't be silly. Lightning can't be bottled twice, no matter how skilled the vintners.
Instead, Steven Spielberg's "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" is merely grand old-school fun - a rollicking class reunion that stands as the second best entry in the venerable series. Premiering yesterday at the Cannes Film Festival and opening worldwide on Thursday, the new movie is leagues better than 1984's nasty "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom" and blessed with more snap and heart - more fun - then 1989's pro forma "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade." All that's lacking is a genuine sense of surprise. It's very possible that was left out on purpose.
The emphasis in "Crystal Skull" is on old-fashioned stunt work rather than the shiny chimeras of modern digital effects. When Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) catapults from the back of a motorcycle through the window of a speeding car, out the opposite window and back onto the motorcycle - his feet nervously skitching along the roadbed - at least half the excitement is knowing that motorcycle, car, Ford, and road are real.
Thankfully, the approach goes only so far. Character and star may have aged two decades since the last installment, but bullets still miss the good guys with astonishing regularity, and Indiana Jones may be the only person who could escape a desert nuclear test site with an A-bomb due to land in 10 seconds. How he manages this makes no blessed sense, but it's a hoot anyway.
That scene occurs in the movie's first 15 minutes, in the sort of fast-charging prologue Spielberg and producer George Lucas know we're expecting. The sequence also establishes the time (1957), the enemy (Russian Communists), and the stakes (power over all mankind - the usual). Better, it reintroduces Indy as a believably older but still absurdly capable figure out of a Saturday matinee serial, and it brings on Cate Blanchett as Irina Spalko, a Red menace with a sword, a Louise Brooks bob, and a nifty accent by way of Natasha in the old "Rocky and Bullwinkle" cartoons. "Drop dead, comrade," the hero sneers at Irina, and that's a good description of the best "Indiana Jones" villain yet: She's a drop-dead comrade.
To sum up the plot of "Crystal Skull" requires dancing around a number of spoilers, so stop reading now if you want to go in with a clean slate. What Spalko and her KGB minions are after is a rare and very strange crystal skull that legends say was stolen from El Dorado, the lost city of gold in Peru. One of Indiana's colleagues, Professor Oxley (John Hurt), has set out to find it and disappeared, and a young man named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) arrives to beg Jones to rescue his old friend.
This being the '50s, Mutt is first seen riding a motorcycle with his cap askew just like Marlon Brando in "The Wild One." He's a preppie who has dropped out to become a greaser instead of a beatnik, and the sequence in which he and Indiana career through the college campus (inside the library and out) with Russians in high-speed pursuit is an early high point.
It's bookended later in the film by a delirious action set piece involving multiple jeeps, a sheer cliff face, monkeys, vines, and a ravenous army of giant ants. (This last leads to one of the few gross-out scenes in "Skull," which is noticeably less gruesome than the other sequels. It's still a bit too spooky in places for young children.)
The basic structure of these action scenes hasn't changed in 20 years, but camera technology and Spielberg's skill at deploying it have. There's an organic smoothness to the mayhem that can take your breath away, so much so that the less inspired aspects of "Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" stick out more clearly.
It's wonderful, for instance, to see Karen Allen reprise her role as Marion Ravenwood from "Raiders," since her warmth was precisely what was missing from the first two sequels. (Let us now officially forget all about Kate Capshaw and the unfortunate Alison Doody.) The script doesn't give Allen quite enough to do, though, and the family dynamics that take over the last third of the movie feel overly familiar.
Indeed, a number of Spielberg career threads are woven into "Skull," including a climactic shot that blatantly rehashes the finale of one of the director's best-loved early films. While Ford wears the fedora with believably weathered panache, on some level this Indy seems smaller, less archetypal than his younger incarnation. Where the character once towered over these movies, now he's just the leader of the pack.
The rest of the cast keeps pace - Ray Winstone as an accomplice who may or may not be a betrayer, Jim Broadbent taking over for the late Denholm Elliott as Indy's college friend. LaBeouf has an interesting alertness that he still hasn't figured out how to use as an actor, but he throws himself into the stunt work like a proper student at the feet of the masters.
It bears asking, though: What do we want from an "Indiana Jones" movie in 2008? Engaged nostalgia, I think, and on that level "Crystal Skull" delivers. This isn't a reinvention but a reunion, of characters, creators, even techniques. "Same old same old," Jones says at one point, and that's what we get. The action may have been updated to the 1950s, but in ways both inspired and unexamined, "Indiana Jones" remains happily stuck in the '80s.


 CANNES, France — “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is a movie for boomers of all ages, though you can bet the bank that plenty of tots will be tagging along with Mom and Dad, Granny and Gramps. Like the 1981 blockbuster “Raiders of the Lost Ark,” the first in a monster franchise that has spawned two previous movie sequels, a television series, comics, novels, video games and Disney theme-park attractions, this new one was directed by Steven Spielberg, cooked up and executive produced by George Lucas (with Kathleen Kennedy) and stars Harrison Ford as the archaeologist-adventurer-sexpot with the sardonic grin, rakish fedora and suggestive bullwhip.  This latest Indy escapade, which was shown out of competition at the Cannes Film Festival and will probably scoop up more money than the rest of the selections combined, serves as a reunion for the principal creative team. Almost two decades have lapsed since the third installment in the series, “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” (1989). In the years since, Mr. Lucas — whose logo for Lucasfilm  received the loudest applause at the press screening in Cannes — continued to build his special-effects empire and resurrected the “Star Wars” franchise while Mr. Spielberg has oscillated between serious-minded projects and financially instrumental entertainments.  For his part, Mr. Ford rode the ups and downs of high-concept stardom, oscillating between roles that called for him to flash his customary wry grin or his equally familiar grumpy frown. He wears both in “The Crystal Skull,” though the busy story makes enormous effort to keep the mood happy and snappy and decidedly PG-13 friendly — P.C. friendly, too, as in politically correct, with fewer dark-skinned people popping their eyeballs. Not that Indy has gone soft or the natives have gone hard, mind you, only that Mr. Spielberg no longer seems as eager to cut down extras for a laugh.  Thank goodness for the fall of the Soviet Union and the rise of Vladimir V. Putin, which have expedited the return of blond-haired, blue-eyed villainy to the screen. Set in 1957, this new Indy yarn, written by David Koepp from a story by Mr. Lucas and Jeff Nathanson, takes place far from the Middle East even if it opens in a desert. The bad guys this time are cold war Reds first seen poking around an American military base and led by Irina Spalko. A caricature given crude, playful life by Cate Blanchett, Irina owes more than a little to Rosa Klebb, the pint-size Soviet operative played by Lotte Lenya, who took on James Bond in “From Russia With Love.”  Dressed in gray coveralls, her hair bobbed and Slavic accent slipping and sliding as far south as Australia, Ms. Blanchett takes to her role with brio, snapping her black gloves and all but clicking her black boots like one of those cartoon Nazis that traipse through earlier Indy films. She’s pretty much a hoot, the life of an otherwise drearily familiar party. Among the other invited guests are Ray Winstone, John Hurt and Shia LaBeouf, who plays Mutt, the young sidekick onboard to bring in those viewers whose parents were still in grade school when the first movie hit. Karen Allen, who played Indy’s love interest in “Raiders,” is here too, with a megawatt smile and a bit of the old spunk.  If only the filmmakers seemed as eager to see — and to please — the audience as Ms. Allen. There’s plenty of frantic energy here, lots of noise and money too, but what’s absent is any sense of rediscovery, the kind that’s necessary whenever a filmmaker dusts off an old formula or a genre standard. “Raiders of the Lost Ark” creaks with age now, but to look at it again is to see Mr. Spielberg actively engaging in an organic whole, taking a beloved template and repurposing it for the modern blockbuster age he helped create. By contrast, “The Crystal Skull” comes alive only in isolated segments, in a clever motorcycle chase that ends in a library and, best of all, in an eerie sequence at  an atomic test site that wittily puts the nuclear in family.  The original Indiana Jones venture was inspired by Mr. Lucas and Mr. Spielberg’s love for 1930s serials, but you’d be hard pressed to find much inspiration in their latest collaboration. There’s plenty of perspiration, of course, what with the wall-to-wall chases — many tricked out with obvious computer-generated effects — that careen one into another like colliding big rigs. As expected, the high leaps and long jumps look impressive, even if it’s something of a bummer when one of the best directors working today (Mr. Spielberg) doesn’t seem to be working as hard as the stunt crew. Initially, I thought he was bored with the material (he wouldn’t be alone), but now I think he’s just grown out of this kind of sticky kids’ stuff.  Creative ennui certainly might explain why he spends so much time riffing both on his own greatest hits — Indy and company have an encounter of a close, insipid kind — and on other movies. Some of these allusions amuse (a sea of red ants parting à la “The Ten Commandments”) while others are just painful (Mr. LaBeouf done up to resemble Marlon Brando in “The Wild One”). It’s odd to see Mr. Spielberg recycling plot points already chewed through by Roland Emmerich in “Stargate,” though Indy’s brief encounter with some ferociously feathered Indians who look right out of Mel Gibson’s “Apocalypto” was a tantalizingly sweet pip, a sequel in waiting (“Indiana Jones Meets Mad Max”) or maybe just a YouTube mash-up.  “Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Death, but little blood.

One of the most eagerly and long-awaited series follow-ups in screen history delivers the goods -- not those of the still first-rate original, 1981�s �Raiders of the Lost Ark,� but those of its uneven two successors. �Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull� begins with an actual big bang, then gradually slides toward a ho-hum midsection before literally taking off for an uplifting finish. Nineteen years after their last adventure, director Steven Spielberg and star Harrison Ford have no trouble getting back in the groove with a story and style very much in keeping with what has made the series so perennially popular. Few films have ever had such a high mass audience must-see factor, spelling giant May 22 openings worldwide and a rambunctious B.O. life all the way into the eventual �Indiana Jones� DVD four-pack.
As has been well chronicled, Spielberg and exec producer George Lucas went through no end of writers and story concepts before plausibly updating the action precisely the same number of years as have elapsed since �Last Crusade,� to 1957, smack dab in the middle of the Cold War. U.S. versus USSR dynamic spurs the dynamite opening action sequence, in which a convoy of Russian soldiers camouflaged in American army vehicles rolls into a remote desert nuclear testing base in search of a coveted object. Helping them in this effort will be their prisoner, Indiana Jones.
With an energy and enthusiasm bespeaking years of pent-up desire to get back to this sort of fun filmmaking, Spielberg sets the period spirit with a rock �n� roll-fueled drag race and, with the characters� entry into the legendary Hangar 51, intimations of an other-worldly presence. As the aging issue is tossed off with a joke or two, the sixtysomething hero quickly proves that the passage of time will not be an inhibiting factor all these years later, as Indy trades smart remarks with the formidable Soviet officer Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) before jumping into action the equal of any of the great setpieces the entire series has previously offered.
In Spalko, the film has a villain worthy not just of Indiana Jones but of a James Bond film, one who�s madly intelligent as well as appreciative of an opponent she views as a near-equal. With her trim gray uniform, silver rapier, Louise Brooks haircut and piercing blue eyes, Blanchett provides a major treat whenever she�s around. 
The 20 nonstop opening minutes include a striking variation on the many cookie-cutter middle-class housing tracts featured in Spielberg films, this one populated exclusively by plastic figurines enacting a cliche of a �50s Yank lifestyle while awaiting the nuclear test to come, one Indy must quickly figure out how to survive. Even that�s not the end of the scene, which runs the length of the sort of Saturday matinee adventure serial that inspired the series in the first place.
Like the bravura opening sequence of �Saving Private Ryan,� this smashing launch sets a standard the rest of the film has some trouble living up to. When Professor Jones returns to his university, he�s informed by his dean (Jim Broadbent, replacing the late Denholm Elliott) that he�s being suspended due to FBI doubt over his loyalty. Indiana Jones suspected of commie sympathies? And this after he�s already told Spalko that �I like Ike.�
Another iconic aspect of the decade rolls in with a kid named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf), a leather-jacketed biker who travels with comb and switchblade. Between a contrived fistfight and extended motorized chase around the leafy college campus, Mutt sets the grand adventure in motion by offering evidence of the possible location of the Crystal Skull of Akator, an object of great archeological and, possibly, psychic and other-dimensional fascination.
In a nostalgia-producing air travel montage like those in previous series entries, Indy and Mutt make their way to Peru, where the action relaxes in some rather rote creepy-crawly cave shenanigans before the guys lay their hands on the crystal skull itself, an oddly shaped clear cranium that all agree is not of human origin. But it�s shortly snatched by Spalko, who believes the skull possesses psychic power that would prove decisive in mind warfare, no doubt ending the Cold War then and there.
All this gibberish is merely designed to justify the battle of wits and weapons, which continues apace as the Russians collect two further prisoners, Indy�s old cohort and crystal skull expert, the now insane Professor Oxley (John Hurt), and Mutt�s mom, none other than Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen), Indy�s flame from �Raiders� and clearly the woman he was always meant to be with. 
Coming at pic�s midway point, it�s a welcome reunion, although written to escalate too quickly into intense bickering; a few more initial beats of mutual recognition, to permit the resonance of their relationship to seep back into the characterizations, would have give the rematch more heft.
But it�s off and running again, with a race through the jungle as the good guys and bad guys jump between vehicles, duel with fists, sabers and machine guns, are assaulted by monkeys and ravenous giant ants and, in an undoubted preview of a forthcoming theme-park ride, plummet down three imposing waterfalls. For pure action thrills, this sequence rates close to the first one, yet there�s one more to come, a mixed-bag wrap-up that transports the Indiana Jones series into a realm it�s never occupied before but is well familiar to Spielberg and Lucas.
For all the verbiage expended just to keep the story cranking forward, David Koepp�s script accomplishes the two essentials: It keeps the structure on the straight and narrow, and is true to the character of Indiana Jones himself. Thanks to this and Ford�s full-bodied performance, Indy comes through just as viewers remember him: crafty, capable, impatient, manly and red-blooded American. He looks great for his age, although it�s never pretended he�s younger than he is, and Mutt pays him the ultimate compliment when he says, �For an old man, you ain�t bad in a fight.�
Allen also looks real good and radiates the same winning smile and tomboyish enthusiasm that made her �Raiders� characterization so critical to the film�s complete success; her Marion is perhaps the greatest Hawksian female performance in anything other than a Howard Hawks film. LaBeouf eventually earns his stripes after a somewhat forced beginning, and Ray Winstone, along with fellow Brits Hurt and Broadbent, fills out the roster of newcomers as a duplicitous mercenary who switches sides with each change of fortune.
Technically, film is every bit as accomplished as one expects from Spielberg and the series. Of the director�s key original collaborators, editor Michael Kahn and composer John Williams return in full form. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas provides some striking creations, particularly the ancient circular chamber that houses the climax. First three series were lensed by the great British d.p. Douglas Slocombe in bold, clean images, and while Spielberg�s now-regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski has mostly succeeded in reproducing this look, which is very different from his usual style, he still can�t prevent himself from letting in some characteristic flared light and hazy backgrounds. 


Here's your hat, Indy, but, really, what's your hurry? Because 19 years after the Last Crusade  that clearly wasn't, and 15 years after the old man joined Young Indiana Jones  on the small screen to recount his glory days blowing horns with Sidney Bechet , it's almost unfathomable that this  hoary mishmash is the best that George Lucas  and Steven Spielberg  could cough up.
Have we learned nothing about disturbing dusty relics and mussing with primordial remains? These only lead to trouble—melted faces, some crazy dude sticking his fist in your chest, and, well, more melting faces. This time, though, an even worse fate lies ahead for trampling trespassers: National Treasure  by way of The X-Files  , only not as pleasurable as so dreadful a coupling would suggest. Bury thyself, Dr. Jones, and pray no one disturbs the corpse in this or any other millennium.
From humdrum start to shrugging finish, Indiana Jones  and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  bears almost no resemblance to its three predecessors: It's absent the spark and spirit of Raiders of the Lost Ark , the grown-up menace and slapdash comedy of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom,  and the loose-limbed effervescence and emotional jolts of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade . It's hard to tell whether Spielberg and Lucas are trying too hard or trying at all—the thing's such a mess, such an unmitigated disaster, that damned is the scholar stuck with the unfortunate task of deciphering this cynical, clinical gibberish in decades to come.
Much has been made of Lucas and Spielberg, and a cadre of screenwriters (including the solely credited David Koepp ), pushing the franchise into the late 1950s—away from the Nazis and biblical collectors' items and toward the Russians and ETs. Early word suggested a film verging on summer camp, as creaky ol' Indy (Harrison Ford , looking not a day over 62) donned fedora and whip and Cate Blanchett  slipped into dominatrix bob-cut bangs and borscht-scented accent for some outer-space trip flavored with the era's grade-Z conventions, just as the first films proffered yellowed pulp cliffhangers and widescreen smirks. But Crystal Skull  is no fun at all—not for a single second, not even accidentally. Not even with Shia LaBeouf  terribly miscast as Marlon Brando  as the Wild One. (The Mild One? Sure, fine.)
The dialogue's drab when not absolutely dumb; the actors seem lost if not outright listless; the scant action sequences appear to have been filmed entirely in front of green screens, suggesting a movie shot during breaks from lunch catered in a studio boss's office. (Is anyone sure producer Lucas didn't actually direct?) And the storyline's a bunch of convoluted mumbo and pointless jumbo having to do with Russians and mind control and the mythical golden South American city of El Dorado, which, according to The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull , may have been constructed by "visitors" who taught the locals how to, um, farm. Twenty years between offerings, and this is all that the A-team could come up with? Close Encounters of the Turd Kind ?
"I'm making this up as I go," said Indiana Jones 27 long years ago, and Raiders  possessed the kineticism of the improvised sprawled across myriad continents. Temple of Doom  was more precise, from its beautifully choreographed opening sequence to its roller-coaster ride through a mine shaft—best sequence in the series, hands (and heads!) down. And for all its flaws as a Raiders  rehash, at least Last Crusade  allowed plenty of room in which Ford and Sean Connery  could play a rousing game of comedic tag.
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull  is as joyless as its predecessors were blissful: Its sole intention seems to be the launching of a new franchise with LaBeouf's Mutt as heir to his father's fedora. And no, it spoils nothing to give away that LaBeouf is the son of Indiana Jones and Karen Allen 's Marion Ravenwood , who appears late in the film and serves little function other than to grin like a schoolgirl at the professor who got away.
There is one rather brilliant sequence, set in a model suburbia that serves as an Army testing ground for nuclear bombs. We're reminded, in a blinding flash, that the Indiana Jones who bested the Nazis is no match for the atomic age. But random asides aside (including a few mentions of government witch-hunts), the movie has no interest in exploring the morality of 1950s America or the mortality of Indiana Jones. It's just an exercise in creating instant nostalgia for boxed sets on sale at a Big Box near you. There are even references to episodes of Young Indiana Jones , about as close as the film gets to clever. (One sight gag, involving a familiar relic, didn't even elicit a chuckle amongst an amped-up preview audience last weekend.)
Still, Indy lumbers forward, surviving not only the copious attacks on his age—"What're you, like, 80?" asks a sneering Mutt upon introduction—but also one more chase in a hijacked truck carrying the key to global domination. This being a George Lucas movie, the dangers are almost entirely computer-generated now; the climactic pursuit through a South American jungle looks like it was shot on the forest moon of Endor , complete with ferocious CG monkeys. The monkeys, however, fare better than Blanchett, who has absolutely no idea what to do with her role: She's equal parts evil and incompetent, and she's the least dangerous villain Indiana Jones has ever faced. Turns out that George Lucas and Steven Spielberg are far more threatening foes.
