 Every character in “Changing Times,” André Téchiné’s rich, warmhearted exploration of cultural collision in contemporary Morocco, oscillates between two worlds and two ideas about the meaning of experience.  Cécile (Catherine Deneuve), the host of a French-Moroccan radio show who lives in Tangier with her much younger husband, Nathan (Gilbert Melki), a doctor, doesn’t believe in holding onto the past. Moments after her station plays a song whose lyrics insist “we remember nothing,” she receives an anonymous bouquet of roses; without a second thought, she tosses them into the trash.  The roses, it turns out, are  from Antoine (Gérard Depardieu), a former lover she hasn’t seen in three decades. A hard-driving engineer who is overseeing the construction of a media center in Tangier, Antoine has literally counted the time (31 years 8 months 20 days) since he saw her last. After years spent tracking her down, he has come to Morocco expressly to win her back. He is so obsessed that he even considers using witchcraft. The two eventually cross paths in a supermarket when Antoine smashes his nose walking into a glass door and Nathan, who is with Cécile, hastens to his aid.  In “Changing Times,” Mr. Téchiné, the great French director, is near the peak of his form. Weaving a half  dozen subplots, he creates a set of variations on the theme of divided sensibilities tugging one another into states of perpetual unrest and possible happiness. This microcosm of a world in transition might seem painfully schematic had it been conceived by a less subtle filmmaker. But for the most part Mr. Téchiné carries it off without its seeming heavy-handed. When it’s time to end the movie after a swift, compact 95 minutes, he refuses to wind his stories into a tight knot and lets most of the threads dangle.  Much of the movie’s charm lies in its sheer vitality. Mr. Téchiné loves people and life, and every scene is filled with light, music, activity and a sensuous appreciation of landscape. The characters are continually on the move. Even Antoine is too busy most of the time to sit around moping. In the movie’s circular structure, Antoine is buried in a mudslide at a rain-drenched building site near the beginning of the film and then the story backtracks, only letting us know his fate after the accident is reprised near the end. Mr. Depardieu and Ms. Deneuve, who have co-starred many times before, give contained, unsentimental performances.  Cécile’s marriage  —  to Nathan, whose career has stalled and who admits to having had several affairs —  has lost its spark. And Ms. Deneuve plays her as a woman who has buried her youthful dreams and clings to a low-paying job that gives her a sense of independence. She copes with life in a state of mild exasperation.  Antoine, whom she remembers as thin, poor and proud, is now portly, well-to-do and accustomed to giving orders. He has never married, and his obsession with the loss of his great love is the chink in his armor that both humanizes him and makes him a little creepy.  Around the time Antoine arrives in Tangier, Cécile and Nathan’s bisexual son, Sami (Malik Zidi), who lives in Paris, appears unannounced with his live-in girlfriend, Nadia (Lubna Azabal), and Said (Jabir Elomri), her 9-year-old son by another man. While Nadia, who is seriously addicted to tranquilizers, languishes in a funk, Sami dashes off for trysts with his Moroccan boyfriend, Bilal (Nadem Rachati).  Bilal, who briefly lived in Paris and is now the resident groundskeeper of a fancy estate rarely visited by its owners, more or less accepts Sami’s ambivalence. “You’re too indecisive, but I guess that’s normal,” he observes with a tinge of bitterness. “You’re half Moroccan, half French, half man, half woman. It must be difficult knowing who you are.”  Nadia, meanwhile, has accompanied Sami to Tangier hoping to reconnect with her identical twin sister, Aicha (also played by Ms. Azabal), a man-hating observant Muslim who works in a McDonald’s. Their twinship is the most strained of the movie’s several metaphoric pairings.  As is often the case with Téchiné films, the characters hover on the line between cultural constructions and fully drawn people. What does Nadia offer Sami, who obviously prefers men? How did the twins end up living such radically different lives? The movie doesn’t begin to ask such questions; it doesn’t have the time.  That’s one  reason Mr. Téchiné’s films feel so buoyant: no one is weighed down by too much psychological baggage. He accepts that human behavior is mysterious and unpredictable. Even his unhappiest characters are players in a larger vision of a multicultural world in continual flux. The impulse to connect across cultures is a fundamental urge that’s worth the pain and uncertainty; it offers the same rewards as learning a new language.

A successful construction engineer who has continued pining for his first love for more than 30 years tracks her down in "Changing Times." A Cathererine Deneuve-Gerard Depardieu vehicle that leaves ample room for interesting supporting characters, this moody, more-bitter-than-sweet ode to anxiety is intense adult fare reinforced by effective no frills lensing. Andre Techine's latest spin on familiar themes -- including sex vs. love, cross-generational relations, homosexuality and the gap between well-to-do Europe and developing nations -- deserves to travel.
Antoine Lavau (Depardieu), a hulk of a man with the permanently hurt expression of a bewildered little boy, arrives in Tangiers to oversee the building of a media communications center. Paralleling his professional mission is a crucial personal one: He has never married because for 31 years and 8 months he's never stopped thinking about Cecile (Deneuve) with whom he shared a symbiosis of love and desire that's eluded him since, and he plans to track her down in Tangiers where she now lives.
Cecile, who hosts the French portion of a nightly French-Arabic radio show, is married to Natan (Gilbert Melki), a Moroccan doctor at least a decade her junior. Their son Sami (Malik Zidi) has just arrived from Paris with Nadia (Lubna Azabal) and her 9-year-old son. Back in France, Sami lives with Nadia and her boy, but he is more attracted to men than to women. He's come to Tangiers to see an old boyfriend.
When Antoine meets Natan under tragicomic circumstances, Cecile is abruptly confronted with this lovesick puppy from her past. This puppy, however, is far better off than she is and wants only to live out the rest of his life by her side. As Cecile's radio partner Rachel (Tanya Lopert) puts it: "It's usually women who get worked up and carry a torch like that."
Meanwhile, Nadia's observant Muslim twin sister Aicha (also Azabal) hasn't seen her for six years and refuses to see her now.
From this bundle of crossed wires, Techine captures just enough sparks. Deft thesping abetted by a probing camera style prevents meller elements from devolving into mere soap opera. Scene in which Antoine and Natan frankly discuss Antoine's designs on Natan's wife is a high point in a screenplay that manages to incorporate gay sex, drug addiction, sorcery, exorcism and even killer dogs without seeming overly contrived.
Deneuve and Depardieu -- instantly credible as a couple with a passionate past -- remain pic's chief pleasure.

A reliable and often hypnotic manufacturer of U.S.-releasable French cinema, André Téchiné  seemed on a humanistic cutting edge in the '90sthe structurally unpredictable Wild Reeds  (1994) and Les Voleurs  (1996) still offer catch-your-breath moments of suspended poetry. But if the title, knee-jerk cast, pop-song intro, and schmaltzy plotline of his new film Changing Times  is any indication, he's now the French mainstream, the premier Gallic pilot of high-toned soap opera. Téchiné has always been an electric image maker, but his narratives are prone to diffusion or cliché, and there may not be a single propulsively written story in his 30-year filmography.
Which may be beside the point, because Téchiné is all about texture, and Changing Times  is soil-rich with thoughtful messiness, from the autumnal angst darkening the exhausted visage of star Gérard Depardieu  to the stormy evocation of postcolonial life. Set in Tangier  almost entirely among bourgeois French émigrés, Téchiné's film obsessively detours, often just visually, toward the background of the still oppressed Arab poor, day workers, refugees, rampant Euro-development (Depardieu plays a mega-site construction manager), and pious Muslim women forced to work the counter at a Moroccan McDonald's. These contemplations almost form a second movie, upstaged by the dramatics caused by Depardieu's unhappy suit, who is actually in the country to woo Catherine Deneuve 's aging radio host, for whom he's held a candle for 30 years.
His motivations are only gradually revealed, but meanwhile the mix is complicated by Deneuve's bi son (Malik Zidi ), who returns from Paris with a tetchy Arab girlfriend (Lubna Azabal ) and a young son of his own, and who is rather more interested in a Moroccan boyfriend (Nadem Rachati). Addiction, Islamic propriety versus blood ties, infidelity, marital turbulencethe screenplay (co-written with Laurent Guyot  and Rivette-and-Ruiz vet Pascal Bonitzer ) tries but fails to knit its multitude of ideas together. The implicit political statement encroaching on nearly every shot and every character never coalescesthe hero's mission of the heart is genuine, and his beleaguered role as a corporate bulldozer seems beside the primary romantic point. We, in any case, are as unconvinced by his lovelorn saga as Deneuve's skeptical pragmatistthat is, until a romance paperback deus ex machina shoots the film's lifelike credibility out of the water.
