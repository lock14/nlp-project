Not being a fan of competitive ice dancing or NASCAR, I wasn�t bothered when Ferrell brought his inane brand of fraternity-house mockery to Blades of Glory
 or Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby
. Those sports probably deserved to be parodied (though some might argue that any parody was bound to be redundant), and if the country wanted to see Ferrell running around in his unmentionables while it was happening, then the country was entitled. But basketball � basketball doesn�t deserve the Ferrell treatment. Basketball is a sport of kings, a thing of beauty and elegance, America�s game. Which doesn�t mean that it shouldn�t be mocked but that, if it must be mocked, it deserves to be mocked well, and Semi-Pro
, unfortunately, isn�t up to the challenge. Like most sports comedies, Semi-Pro
 is about a team of lovable losers which unites to save its franchise from failure, shame, and financial disaster. Ferrell plays Jackie Moon: owner, coach, announcer, and starting power forward for the woeful Flint, Mich., Tropics. The year is 1976, a time when Afros and short shorts ruled the hard-court and the struggling American Basketball Association was preparing to merge with the NBA. Despite their dreams of NBA stardom, the Tropics are the dregs of the league, more famous for their belligerent radio announcers, bikini-clad cheerleaders, and empty arenas than their ability on the court. Which is fine with Moon, who sees basketball less as a sport than an excuse to engage in off-the-wall promotional campaigns (including halftime bear-wrestling matches and Evel Knievel-like roller-skating daredevilry). This is perfect terrain for Ferrell because it affords him endless opportunities to display his doughy, hair-covered body; shout profanities into microphones; engage in random acts of violence against himself and others; and generally make a spectacle of himself. In other words: Be Will Ferrell. It�s the same formula that turned him from a small-time stage comedian into a Hollywood superstar, and somehow it just keeps driving movie fans to distraction. There were people at the screening I went to who only had to see Ferrell�s face before they were weeping with joy, as if he�s some kind of slapstick messiah � or Barack Obama. Meanwhile, I just sat in my seat looking grim and feeling like an entire world of comedy had simply passed me by. Maybe Ferrell is beyond criticism. Maybe any man willing to show millions of viewers his underpants in the name of comedy should be. Okay, Mr. Ferrell, you win; I give up. Call me when your ice-fishing movie comes out. I�ll be there, in the front row, as confused as ever but resigned to cruel fate. (See "Will Ferrell Plays Dirty
," for an interview with Ferrell.)



"Semi-Pro," the new Will Ferrell movie, is stuffed with familiar frat house funnyboys - Andy Richter, Will Arnett, Rob Corddry, David Koechner - but the funniest character is probably the mid-1970s. The Disco Decade is the setting for this amiably sloppy basketball comedy, and it has a hairstyle (puffy), a rhythm (funk), a material (polyester), and a flavor (Shasta Red Apple). When some of the players sit down to play Pong, the joke is how insanely excited they are. They're like cavemen discovering a two-pixel fire.
The movie itself is pretty much what we've come to expect from Ferrell, which suggests it's time to reboot the franchise. (He must be running out of ideas; the film's a scant 86 minutes.) The borderline-silly sport this go-round is the "outlaw" American Basketball Association, which really did exist for nine seasons from 1967 to 1976 before being swallowed by the NBA. The star again plays a clueless, graceless naif with too much body hair: Jackie Moon, the owner of the Flint (Mich.) Tropics, who triples as the team's power forward, publicity coordinator, and half-time choreographer.
And again the hero suffers a comic crisis of confidence before bouncing back against all odds, louder and more deluded than ever. You know what you get with Ferrell, and if you don't like it, stay away. If you do, you'll get your laughs, but they won't be as sweet as with "Elf" or as inspired as the ones in "Anchorman:The Legend of Ron Burgundy," still the best movie the man's ever done.
The primary difference in "Semi-Pro" is the movie's locker-room setting and sensibility. The R rating is for language and a lot of creative energy has gone into new uses for old Anglo-Saxonisms; it's one of the more memorably potty-mouthed films in a while. This being the mid-'70s, though, the worst thing you can call a man is a jive turkey - that one almost starts a shoot-out.
Jackie's team is the usual assembly of post-"Bad News Bears" screw-ups (Jackie Earle Haley - Kelly Leak himself - shows up as a stoner fan in the stands). There's the hulking Lithuanian (Peter Cornell), the no-talent Larry Bird look-alike (Josh Braaten), a bunch of African-American Flint locals, and the one decent player, Clarence "Coffee" Black, played with sharp wit by OutKast singer Andre Benjamin.
The ABA commissioner (Koechner) announces the league's going bust, with only four teams to be absorbed into the NBA, and after the expected Ferrell hissy fit Jackie decides to compete, trading the team's washing machine for the washed-up point guard Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson). Disappointingly, Harrelson mostly plays it straight - maybe he saves his comic instincts for dramas like "No Country for Old Men" - and he vows to put the team on top. OK, in fourth place, but it's a start.
The problem with "Semi-Pro" is that it keeps forgetting it's a parody of sports movies; the final scenes are supposed to be uplifting (sort of) but they're not fooling anyone. The film's much better when it just lets the guys gas and sass each other. A bit with a supposedly unloaded gun is a joyously dumb series of riffs on one of the oldest cliches in the slapstick playbook.
The supporting cast is hit and miss, but they're having a good time, especially toward the end when the team gets divine inspiration for the Alley-Oop pass (so that's where it was invented). I liked the sportscasting team of macho, anal-implosive Arnett and unfailingly polite Andrew Daly; even the way the latter corrects the others on the pronunciation of his name - "Dick Pepperfield" - is funny.
The lone woman here is Maura Tierney as Monix's estranged girlfriend, and she has very little to do in this boys' night out. "Semi-Pro" falls squarely in the middle of the tiny genre of basketball movies - it's much worse than "Hoosiers," much better than "Celtic Pride," and about on a par with "The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh," the 1979 court comedy that could conceivably appear on a theater marquee in this film.
Instead, we get "Mother, Jugs & Speed" on that marquee and wall-to-wall Average White Band and Ohio Players on the soundtrack. That doesn't make "Semi-Pro" a great movie, but, to quote those sages the Brothers Johnson, it does get the funk out ya face for 86 minutes.


 A throwaway scene in “Semi-Pro,” a comedy starring Will Ferrell as Jackie Moon, the owner, coach, promoter and star of a struggling 1970s-era basketball team, boils Mr. Ferrell’s macho man-child persona down to a sentence.  Before a game featuring Jackie’s team, the Tropics from Flint, Mich., the camera pans across cheerleaders at the base of a 100-foot ramp, then reveals Jackie at the top in roller skates and a helmet, steeling himself for an Evel Knievel-style jump. A courtside announcer declares, “The fact that Jackie has never been on roller skates before has apparently done nothing to diminish his confidence.”  Mr. Ferrell’s latest star vehicle, a raunchy, R-rated goof written by Scot Armstrong and directed by Kent Alterman, isn’t as tenderhearted as Mr. Ferrell’s “Elf,” nor does it hit the surreal peaks of “Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,” with its jazz flute solos and gang fights between news teams. But like many of Mr. Ferrell’s recent films, “Semi-Pro” finds the sweet spot between sports melodrama and parody, and hammers it for 90 diverting minutes.  Jackie, a one-hit-wonder pop star turned sports impresario, is a standard-issue Ferrell type: an alpha-male doofus leading like-minded dudes (including Woody Harrelson as a former bench-warming Boston Celtic and André Benjamin as a selfish but talented future star) on a mission of excellence. For the Tropics that means standing out during the final season of the American Basketball Association, a down-market rival of the National Basketball Association, which   merged with the N.B.A. in 1976, with only a few teams joining the fold. If Jackie’s team doesn’t finish at least fourth in the league and draw 2,000 spectators a game, it won’t survive the merger. Desperation and inspiration ensue.  “Semi-Pro” is no docudrama, of course. The A.B.A. never had a team in Flint, much less an owner-coach-player who wrestled grizzlies and promised every spectator a free hot dog if his team broke 125 points. But the film does root many of its jokes in sports history. The A.B.A.’s contributions to pro basketball include the slam-dunk contest, the three-point shot and Julius Erving, nicknamed Dr. J, who played for two A.B.A. teams, the New York Nets and the Virginia Squires. In its absurdist way, “Semi-Pro” alludes to all of the above — including Dr. J., who seems a partial inspiration for Mr. Benjamin’s character.  Like “Anchorman,” “Semi-Pro” pictures the ’70s as a clown’s bacchanal, an era that saw Age of Aquarius utopianism morph into decadent brutishness. (Jackie, an exemplar of both extremes, slaps his players and threatens referees with death, yet insists that his motto is “E.L.E.: Everybody Love Everybody.”) Between its Me Decade jukebox soundtrack, sinuous widescreen photography (by Shane Hurlbut) and fetishistic period details (including the most stunning array of big hair this side of a Tower of Power album cover), “Semi-Pro” often plays like a wacky, sports-themed cousin of Paul Thomas Anderson’s “Boogie Nights.”  While the film never coheres into a great comedy, it offers lively performances (including Will Arnett’s  foulmouthed, alcoholic, chain-smoking sportscaster, and Andrew Daly as his unflappably square partner).  And some of its gags are as insightful as they are ludicrous. One of the best finds Mr. Harrelson’s player-turned-coach, Monix, setting up a tryst with his ex-girlfriend Lynn (Maura Tierney) by dispatching her boyfriend, an obsessive Monix fan named Kyle (Rob Corddry), to buy him a tube of Bengay. The poor dope forgets his wallet, returns to the house and catches the couple in the act, but does not react as you would expect. In fact, his response takes sports fandom to a whole new level.  “Semi Pro” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for profanity and some sexual content.

Very much in the tradition of "Slap Shot," George Roy Hill's raucously funny and foul-mouthed 1977 laffer about the misadventures of a minor-league hockey team, "Semi-Pro" scores big laughs with the rowdy play-by-play of hard-luck hoopsters struggling for professional survival. For some auds, Will Ferrell doing a full-court press in a white-guy afro alone will be worth the price of admission. But the New Line release also offers most valuable playing by a first-rate supporting cast, and enough funny business to ensure enduring playoffs on homevid and cable after a profitable theatrical run. 
Ferrell delivers an amusing spin on his trademark screen persona (a semi-delusional doofus with a misguided sense of self-worth) as Jackie Moon, a one-hit-wonder disco crooner whose single, singular success enabled him to purchase an American Basketball Assn. team -- the Tropics of Flint, Mich. -- and install himself as coach, power forward and chief promoter.
Unfortunately, the team is one of the worst in its upstart league. Even more unfortunately, it's 1976, and the league itself is about to be history: The ABA is set to merge with the longer-established NBA, which plans to disband all but the top four ABA teams.
Desperate to keep his hoop dreams alive, Jackie tries to rally the Tropics by hiring Ed Monix (Woody Harrelson), a fading NBA vet who's very eager to prove he's more than a mere benchwarmer -- and very, very eager to reunite with former sweetheart Lynn (Maura Tierney), who's inconveniently, but not very happily, married.
While Jackie tries to boost game attendance by any means necessary -- a promotional stunt involving a not-so-trained bear becomes a hilarious running gag -- Ed struggles to transform the Tropics into contenders. Trouble is, the team has only one truly talented player -- Clarence "Downtown" Withers (a well-cast Andre Benjamin) -- and even he isn't ready to raise the level of his game until ... well, until the filmmakers decide it's time for him to do so.
Harrelson (returning to roundball action for the first time since "White Men Can't Jump") and Tierney play for keeps even while playing for laughs, so there's an unexpectedly affecting dramatic weight to the relationship between their characters. But none of that ever gets in the way of what "Semi-Pro" is really all about.
By turns riotously silly and casually clever, with the occasional outburst of inspired lunacy, pic benefits from perfect-pitch comic turns by Will Arnett and Andrew Daly as the Tropics' color commentators, Andy Richter as Jackie's loyal team manager, and Jackie Earl Haley as an easily befuddled stoner who scores nothing but net.
Working from a predictable but more-than-serviceable script by Scot Armstrong ("Old School"), first-time feature helmer Kent Alterman, a former New Line development exec, doesn't try anything too flashy or frenetic. (A sportswriter might say he plays within himself.) At the same time, he vividly evokes a strong sense of mid-'70s ambience in ways that go beyond simply choosing the right pop tunes on the soundtrack.
Indeed, with an immeasurable assist from lenser Shane Hurlbut, costume designer Susan Matheson and production designer Clayton Hartley, Alterman has made a set-in-the-'70s pic that actually looks, sounds and feels like something preserved in a time capsule from the polyester era. That's meant as a compliment.

Semi-Pro 's much better than Blades of Glory , which wasn't nearly as good as Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby , which was a little better than Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy  , which was almost as funny as Old School , which was better than everything else Will Ferrell  had done up to that point—except maybe Dick , which nobody saw and even fewer remember. Seems this is what it's come down to with Ferrell: grading his movies in various shades of enh  as each one blends into the next till they're all one giant gray blob of feh . Which sells short the semi-funny Semi-Pro —essentially Major League   clad in 1970s short-shorts, topped with a few 'fros for fun. Still, you seen one Will Ferrell sports comedy, you're good. Too bad you couldn't have started with this one.
After all these others, though, Semi-Pro —written by the man responsible for the unreleasable Heartbreak Kid  redo—is hardly a movie anyway; it's more like a series of Will Ferrell sketches occasionally interrupted by a decent sports-redemption comedy starring Woody Harrelson  as an aging NBA vet who's come crashing back down to the lesser ABA, where he meets the woman he screwed over and left behind (played by Maura Tierney , now married to a dude, played by former Daily Show  -off Rob Corddry , who likes to watch). Harrelson, as former Boston Celtic  benchwarmer Eddie Monix , sports a championship ring around his neck—he figures it's better to keep it hidden on a chain than displayed on his finger, where it would advertise his shame of never having actually gotten off the bench in the NBA Finals.
Monix is the archetypal sports-movie hero: a hobbled vet in need of the Last Big Win before he hangs it up, Crash Davis  in a tight tank top. But Harrelson plays him perfectly, looking left while shooting right—meaning just when you think he's about to go cheap and broad, he feints with ease toward the thoughtful and subtle. This guy's no schmuck—he's a terrific character in a nifty sports movie about the final season of the American Basketball Association's existence, before four of its teams were absorbed by the NBA.
Another terrific character is Andre Benjamin 's Clarence "Coffee" Black, the hot-shit centerpiece of the Flint Tropics, one of the teams about to be adios 'd out of the ABA. The OutKast  frontman doesn't stoop to the clichés, refusing to play Coffee's bluster for cheap giggles; he's got real soul. Actually, the movie's stocked with terrific, fleshed-out characters, chief among them former MADtv   cast member Andrew Daly 's sorta-bent straitlaced play-by-play man Dick Pepperfield, Jackie Earle Haley 's stoned-outta-his-gourd fan Dukes, Andy Richter 's man-boy locker-room attendant Bobby Dee , and Matt Walsh 's foul-mouthed ref Father Pat. There's not a single unsurprising or unlikable character among the bunch.
Except for Jackie Moon . Because no matter how funny his sole hit single ("Love Me Sexy," played a few too many times) and no matter his proclivity for profanity (this has got to be the cursingest Will Ferrell movie, which counts for something), it's just a casual walk in petrified footsteps. Ferrell's once more playing some nutty dude in a sports-movie parody that's totally enjoyable while you're watching it but also insanely forgettable. Ferrell's almost in the way of these movies at this point, the same way his pal and occasional co-star Ben Stiller  is when playing some dim nebbish, which is at least once a year. The movie's better when he's on the bench.
Ferrell, who proved he could do subdued and poignant in the undervalued Stranger Than Fiction , has given up shooting from outside the three-point line. You've seen this act before: He'll speak real low for a really long time and throw raging tantrums and say stupid things and have to get the gang back together for one last Defining Moment and maybe even spawn a catchphrase or two. It's science. At least Ferrell has it down to one, which must be a relief for a first-timer like director Kent Alterman , who valiantly tries to tweak the formula by adding a dash more sincerity and humanity to the froth but doesn't get too adventurous. But in the end, it's comedy comfort food, something powdered poured from a box.
What at least distinguishes Semi-Pro  from its predecessors (not only those starring Ferrell, but also such lesser lights as Dodgeball  and Balls of Fury ) is that it's a slightly darker movie—one made for grown-ups, hence the R rating. In one rather surprisingly tense scene set around a poker table, which begins with someone being called a "jive turkey" as opposed to the apparently more acceptable "cocksucker," a painfully prolonged Deer Hunter  re-enactment breaks out. The audience half-expects someone to blow his head clean off—Jackie Moon, preferably.
