Stop me if you�ve heard this one before: A Hindu mystic travels from India to Toronto to act as spiritual adviser to an African-American hockey player whose obsession with his ex-wife�s generously endowed, mustachioed Quebecois goalie boyfriend is endangering his team�s chances of winning the Stanley Cup. This mystic � the No. 2 professional guru in the world (behind Oprah favorite Deepak Chopra) and author of a whole library of pop self-esteem guides, including I Know You Are, but What Am I
 � revels in pseudo-religious psychobabble, clever wordplay (intimacy = into me I see), and ridiculous pop-culture references. Oh, and he wears a chastity belt with a carved-metal elephant codpiece, and he loves long jokes about diarrhea. In other words, the Guru Pitka is a creation of Mike Myers, the same fevered sketch-comedy mind that gave us Austin Powers, Wayne Campbell, and (king of them all) Dr. Evil. Like those characters, Pitka trafficks in humor that�s heavy on self-awareness (�I was ominous just then,� he informs one adversary after saying something � well � ominous), extended scatology (no one can stretch a gag about testicles like Myers can, not even if he or she wanted to), and convoluted puns that unpack themselves slowly and from a great distance. Unlike those characters, however, Pitka isn�t funny. Not even a little bit. Unlike Dr. Evil, who wasn�t afraid to be unlikable, Pitka�s schtick is one giant cry for acceptance � eccentric but not challenging, therapeutic but not cathartic � which is absolute death to comedy. This, I�m guessing, is why Myers surrounds himself with characters whose only responsibility is to laugh at Pitka�s jokes (the primary culprits being the criminally underused Malco and the criminally overused Alba, who may or may not be a cardboard cutout of a real girl): the better to ensure that audiences don�t drift away and lose the thread of hilarity. In the end, this desperation for approval absolutely buries The Love Guru
. This and the fact that it recycles gags from earlier and better Myers movies and hopes that the audience won�t notice because they�re too busy staring at Timberlake�s bursting Speedo. And then there�s the unshakeable sense that mocking self-help culture is a redundancy, like making fun of reality TV � or Republicans. Honestly, who needs Myers when you�ve got Chopra running around writing books with titles like SynchroDestiny
?

The great Mike Myers characters  Austin Powers, Wayne Campbell, Dieter  all have an inner twinkle, a lyrical crackpot joy that seems to erupt, without precedent, out of Myers' naughty-boy id. That doesn't happen in The Love Guru . As the Guru Pitka, a cheeseball ersatz-Indian mystic in oversize love beads who teaches his celebrity clients how to renounce their egos (even as he personally craves the nirvana of being asked onto Oprah ), Myers is trying for another of his endearingly hormonal imp-egomaniacs, but hidden behind a wavy beard, a wax-curled mustache, and an astoundingly ugly squashed fake nose, he's a little too  grotesque. He plays this flyweight charlatan with a Groucho-lite corrupt patter but without the requisite touch of innocence. The whole characterization is tacky and far too secondhand. Pitka, in essence, is the Maharishi dragged into the age of Deepak Chopra, and Myers doesn't bring much to him beyond a lispy one-note accent (singsong Indian dialect veddy funny, no? Actually...no), his usual beaming leer, and a penchant for lines like ''I'm so hungry I could eat a skunk's bottom!''
As a Caucasian orphan who studied at an Indian ashram with a blind guru (Ben Kingsley, clowning far more merrily than Myers), Pitka was forced to wear a chastity belt, and he still wears one. The movie's equivalent of ''Schwing!'' is the slightly depressing ''Clonk!'' of Pitka getting excited within his metal pelvic prison. But who wants to see a satire of a holy man's lasciviousness in which the hero's business remains under lock and key? The me-so-horny jokes in The Love Guru  are limp imitations of the ones in the Austin Powers  movies  they're basically Myers doing ''Take my crotch, please!'' And the movie, perhaps as a result, tends to fixate on even lower bodily functions. Pitka performs a few songs on the sitar (''Nine to Five,'' ''More Than This''), and he doles out words of wisdom in the form of dirty anagrams, but if you're in the mood for a delightful tweak of today's self-actualizing New Age gurus and their be-here-now snake oil, look elsewhere. If, on the other hand, you want to see gags about boogers, elephant poop, and mano-a-mano duels with mops drenched in urine, then this is the movie for you. The plot, incidentally, is a lifeless ordeal in which Pitka gets hired by the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs (Jessica Alba, pin-up bland) to spiritually enlighten her failing star player (Romany Malco), whose wife has been sleeping with a well-endowed rival. Did I mention that the rival is played, in a '70s mustache, by Justin Timberlake? Or that he's a Celine Dion fan? Okay, you can laugh now.

 It’s likely that the younger generation of moviegoers knows Mike Myers primarily as the voice of Shrek. It has been five years since “The Cat in the Hat,” his last live-action movie, and six since the third “Austin Powers” picture, so a bit of reintroduction may be in order. Kids who wonder just who this guy is — and grownups with a merely casual rather than morbidly obsessive interest in pop-culture ephemera — will need some remedial instruction.  Back in the ’90s, they should be told, Mr. Myers was without peer in a challenging and intensely competitive pursuit: the manufacture of comical catchphrases that, while not especially funny in themselves, would call forth peals of knowing laughter when repeated out of context.  Party on, Garth! Touch my monkey! Groovy, baby, groovy! I’ve got shpilkes in my geneckteckessoink! He had a million of them, or at least a half dozen. But to judge from “The Love Guru,” a new feature film directed by Marco Schnabel, Mr. Myers, a writer and producer as well as the star, seems to have lost his touch. The movie’s takeaway catchphrase is “Mariska Hargitay,” which is used by the title character as a fake-Hindi spiritual greeting. This is almost hilarious the first 11 or so times he does it, but by the time Guru Pitka (Mr. Myers) says “Mariska Hargitay” to Ms. Hargitay herself, it’s somehow less amusing than it should be.  Which might sum up “The Love Guru” in its entirety but only at the risk of grievously understating the movie’s awfulness. A whole new vocabulary seems to be required. To say that the movie is not funny is merely to affirm the obvious. The word “unfunny” surely applies to Mr. Myers’s obnoxious attempts to find mirth in physical and cultural differences but does not quite capture the strenuous unpleasantness of his performance. No, “The Love Guru” is downright antifunny, an experience that makes you wonder if you will ever laugh again.  And this is, come to think of it, something of an achievement. What is the opposite of a belly laugh? An interesting question, in a way, and to hear lines like “I think I just made a happy wee-wee” or “I’m making diarrhea noises in my cup” or to watch apprentice gurus attack one another with urine-soaked mops is to grasp the answer. Please don’t misunderstand: I’m not opposed to infantile, regressive, scatological humor. Indeed, I consider myself something of a connoisseur. Or maybe a glutton. So it’s not that I object to the idea of, say, witnessing elephants copulate on the ice in the middle of a Stanley Cup hockey match, or seeing a dwarf sent flying over the same ice by the shock of defibrillator paddles. But it will never be enough simply to do such things. They must be done well.  Instead Mr. Myers floats through “The Love Guru” with the serene confidence that everything he does will have us rolling in the aisles. He follows nearly every joke with his trademark facial tic, baring his teeth, pushing his head forward and widening his eyes, as if to grant uncertain viewers permission to giggle. Sometimes he does this to indicate the character’s attempt at levity — Guru Pitka making a joke at someone else’s expense rather than Mr. Myers making a joke at Guru Pitka’s — but the distinction hardly matters. The delusional narcissism of the Guru, who dreams of a spot on “Oprah,” is of a piece with Mr. Myers’s own.  The rule seems to be that no one may upstage him and all must adore him. The “Austin Powers” franchise fulfilled the first mandate by casting the star in several roles.  He is supported by a cast that includes Justin Timberlake (as a well-endowed Québécois goalie), Romany Malco (as a hockey star with love trouble) and Jessica Alba, as the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs. A further list — Stephen Colbert! John Oliver of “The Daily Show”! Ben Kingsley! — would only create the misleading impression that there is something worth seeing here. If there is — Did I miss it? Darn! — I’m sure it will show up on YouTube before long. In the meantime talk amongst yourselves.  “The Love Guru” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has crude sexual humor and naughty words. 

�The Love Guru� is so relentlessly juvenile as to merit a new twist on the PG-13 rating -- one that strongly cautions not only those under 13 but anyone much above it, too. Even so, producer/co-writer/star Mike Myers partially wears down resistance by simply pummeling the audience with bathroom jokes, sixth-grade puns and silly songs, and clocking in under 90 minutes, the movie avoids this summer�s comedic mini-trend of overstaying its welcome. Opening opposite �Get Smart� isn�t ideal, but coupled with lingering affection for the �Austin Powers� series, this might just be dumb enough to at least hold its own.
Myers developed the character of Guru Pitka via a sort-of workshop process of New York stage appearances, and for the most part, this spoof of self-help spiritualism feels like a �Saturday Night Live� bit fluffed and stretched to theatrical length.  Many of the jokes bring to mind Three Stooges-type farce (Ben Kingsley�s master guru is named -- now sound this out -- Tugginmypudha), including a seemingly endless array of self-improvement acronyms like Be Loving & Open With My Emotions -- all trademarked, of course.
Although a renowned guru, Pitka suffers from an inferiority complex regarding his childhood pal Deepak Chopra, and yearns to equal Chopra�s level of fame by winning an appearance on �The Oprah Winfrey Show.� (Make what you will of the fact that while Chopra makes a cameo appearance, the pic has to settle for �Oprah� footage and a Winfrey voice impersonator.)
Pitka�s potential ticket to fame comes from the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Jane (Jessica Alba), who is struggling with a star player (Romany Malco) emotionally wounded by a bad marital rift. Hoping to salvage the team�s chances of winning the Stanley Cup Finals, she retains Pitka to cure the case of the yips the player�s developed -- brought about, seemingly, by his wife�s rebound relationship with the enormously endowed Jacques �Le Coq� Grande (Justin Timberlake).
 The porous plot, actually, is all secondary to the shtick, and working completely unfettered by first-time director Marco Schnabel, Myers cheerfully unleashes a steady barrage of hit-and-mostly-miss gags that range from Bollywood numbers (pretty funny) to repeated use of �Mariska Hargitay� (yes, the name of the �Law & Order� star) as a felicitous greeting to elephant erotica (not that funny for anybody who�s ever been to the zoo). With �Powers� � Mini-Me, Verne Troyer, as the Leafs� hockey coach, there�s also a near-limitless supply of runt, elf and Hobbit jokes.
Beyond Myers, pic pretty much squanders its supporting cast -- though Timberlake does steal a few moments with his awful Canadian accent -- which includes Comedy Central�s Stephen Colbert as a drug-addled announcer and �The Daily Show�s� John Oliver as Pitka�s agent. As for Alba, she has even less to do here, if that�s possible, than in �Good Luck Chuck,� which might warrant some further thought about playing the object of desire in screwball comedies.
Rambunctiousness by itself is hardly a virtue, but Myers so unabashedly embraces the lowest rungs of comedic DNA that whether one succumbs to it or not, at least there�s no time to be wasted arguing about subtext. Sitting through �The Love Guru� doesn�t provide any grand insights about self-actualization, but if watching someone get sloshed with urine sounds like a knee-slapper, then Mike Myers is determined to make movies for you. 


Mike Myers  likes ice hockey. He also likes Deepak Chopra , a little bit too much. So he pulled together a bit of hockey and a whole lot of Chopra and called it a plot. Building a movie around the efforts of an also-ran celebrity guru to sort out the internal politics of the Toronto Maple Leafs  was Myers's first mistake. His second was to seek Chopra's blessing and throw him a cameo, thus fluffing a golden opportunity to take a good, strong whack at the guru industry. Kitted out in an orange shirt, Dali  mustache, brown-cow eyes brimming with faux-sympathy and lechery, and a fluid libido, Myers's Guru Pitka, a shaman cursed with lagging behind Chopra on the pop-psych charts, is too like his source to be really funny or really cutting. Indeed, hes a bit of a dear, and completely upstaged by the charm of a bunch of mega-stars ready and waiting to spoof themselves. Team manager Jessica Alba  romps adorably through a goofy Bollywood dance sequence. Goalie Justin Timberlake  gives his all to a sing-off with a Céline Dion  impersonator. And Ben Kingsley , as a cross-eyed Zen master, hasnt been this funny since he swanned around in that outsized diaper in Gandhi . The rest is disposable. Now and again some pungent writing (the script is by Myers with Graham Gordy) leaks through to poke fun at the excruciating banality of guru wisdom. But mostly its dreary dick jokes and elephant poop, slack directing by Marco Schnabel  (a second unit on the Austin Powers  movies), and, of all fatal errors, Mike Myers, shooting for cuddly.
