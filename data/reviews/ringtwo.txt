Back in 2002, I spent a lackluster night with ''The Ring," a remake of a wildly popular Japanese film. Naomi Watts was trying to stop people from watching a fatal videotape. It seemed like propaganda against VCRs.
There were trippy images. But there was a serious lack of suspense, too, and I need a lot more buildup to people climbing out of television sets than Watts running around and shrieking. But millions of other horror-jonesed moviegoers begged to differ, and now there's a sequel, ''The Ring Two," which, despite being made by Hideo Nakata, who directed the original Japanese movie, is almost worse.
Watts is back as news reporter Rachel Keller. So is creepy David Dorfman as her pint-size son Aidan. And this time -- sigh -- it's personal. Because Dorfman looks like the sort of child who must already be possessed, there is, alas, a possession. And sooner than you can say ''Omen II" (or Haley Joel Osment), mom is racing around trying to figure why, how, and what on earth to do.
I won't say much more. But there is a lot of water, which seems downright amniotic given the movie's interest in womb-like set pieces and birth canal symbols and general disdain for motherhood, which, admittedly, for a horror movie is just another day at the office.
You can also bet that Samara, the scary-haired, well-dwelling, undead 'tween wraith from the first movie has something to do with the Kellers' troubles. Samara, who was no cookie to begin with, is now so demonic the sequel's credits have taken to calling her Evil 
Samara.
Nakata is a better director than Gore Verbinski, who oversaw the American remake. Verbinski had no sense of mood or atmosphere and seemed uncomfortable with the ominous stillness these movies require.
Yet Nakata is himself too relaxed, and his use of quiet never builds into exhilarating action. There are two or three mildly exciting sequences. One involves a group of deer that ram into Rachel and Aidan's Volkswagen
. Still, even that is underwhelming. Tea gardens are more chaotic than most of ''Ring Two."
Screenwriter Ehren Kruger has written junk like ''Reindeer Games" and the unpolished gem that was ''Scream 3," movies that have a jolting surprise somewhere. ''Ring Two" doesn't have any. Instead, he and Nakata seem to have worked out a deal wherein the director is allowed to do whatever he wants as long as the writer dumps an explanation for it into a character.
This half-explains the trip to the asylum where a loon -- played by Sissy Spacek as an overmedicated Carrie White -- gives Rachel valuable advice that sounds pretty useless to us.
The movie's torpid pacing and blocks of dead space will leave plenty of time for a bored and frustrated audience to yell obscenities at the screen. An uneventful trip to snoop around a dank basement could double as an opportunity to tell Watts, who commits her worst acting to date, how dumb her character is -- as a journalist, as a mother, and as a potential victim -- which even for this genre is saying a lot.
We go to a horror film for an involuntary shock or an ecstatic release, and people desperate for a real one in a movie that has none will settle for doing it themselves, instead. During the screening I was at, someone crept up on a girl in the front row, and she let out a good scream.
It wasn't as good as Watts's, but it made me jealous anyway. So, utterly dissatisfied with ''Ring Two," I went home after and crept up on myself.


         In "The Ring Two," Naomi Watts plays Rachel Keller, hard-boiled journalist, single mother of an eerily self-possessed child, and the woman partially responsible for unleashing a deadly, replicating media virus on the unsuspecting Pacific Northwest in "The Ring."
 
  "The Ring Two" is the sequel to the American remake (written by Ehren Kruger and directed by Gore Verbinski) of the Japanese smash hit "Ringu." "Ringu," directed by Hideo Nakata, spawned a sequel directed by Nakata and a prequel not directed by Nakata. "The Ring Two" is directed by Nakata from a script by Kruger but bears little resemblance to its Japanese counterpart. None of this, by the way, has anything to do with the aforementioned media virus — though the franchise does seem to spread like Ebola.
 


         






    The premise of "The Ring Two" is that there's still 
a mysterious bootleg video being passed around that kills anyone who watches it within seven days. The video — a collage of light goth imagery in sepia tones — looks like something Joel- Peter Witkin might dream after a late-night enchilada. In fact, it's the nightmare imagery of a ghost child named Samara (Daveigh Chase), whose adoptive mother shoved her down a well years earlier, before summarily flinging herself off the nearest cliff.
 
  In "The Ring," Rachel tracked down Samara's body and buried it, unintentionally exposing her son Aidan (David Dorfman) and his feckless father, Noah (Martin Henderson), to the curse in the process. When Samara kills Noah, Rachel realizes that she is dealing with more than a sad ghost child — she's dealing with a clingy, cloying pre-adolescent incubus out to take over her life.
 
  Which brings us to "The Ring Two." Rachel and Aidan have traded their high-rise condo in Seattle for a homey cottage in small-town Oregon, and Rachel has downgraded from her big city paper to a poky local one. The start of the movie finds a somewhat tetchy Rachel baking Aidan a deflated pie, trying to rationalize her guilt over making two copies of the tape (the second one saved Aidan's life) and suggesting her son start calling her "mommy." (The child declines, because " 'Rachel' is more your personality.")
 
  Their self-conscious domestic bliss ends abruptly when a local teen dies with a Munch-ian scream plastered on his face, and Rachel realizes that Samara has tracked them down. (Somehow, Rachel accidentally freed Samara from her reliance on nearly obsolete video equipment, and though it's never explained how Samara recorded her nightmares onto VHS, her stellar success at self-distribution should strike terror in the hearts of music industry types and the like everywhere.)
 
  She's wireless now, basically. Airborne and dangerous.
 
  "The Ring Two" makes about as much sense as "The Ring" — which is to say, pretty much none. Old loose ends get snarled together with new ones, and even though a little more information about Samara's background is revealed, her true provenance remains vague.
 
  The illogic doesn't detract from the fun, though; the movie is as side-splitting as it is creepy, especially when it ventures into surrealistic nightmare imagery. Nakata can't help fully availing himself of the special effects at his disposal, but the sight of Sissy Spacek done up like Michael Jackson in a Witchiepoo wig is much scarier than the CGI burning tree that flames in Aidan's room.
 
  Nothing compares, though, with the slithery awfulness of Samara, that faceless, waterlogged Wednesday Addams, capable of making a hair-clogged drain seem terrifying. Samara, who had two mommies in life, can't get enough of them in the afterlife. Now she wants to be in Aidan's place.
 
  The tense, chilly Rachel is discomfited by her new role as a traditional mother, as is her son. The last thing she needs is Samara hiding inside Aidan's body, calling her "mommy" (the word has never sounded so chilling), and putting her in the awkward tautological position of having to fight her child to save her child.
 
  Once "The Ring Two" finds its theme — motherhood is terrifying — the picture snaps together, delving with gusto into the collective what's-with-this-mommy-business jitters that seem to have lately been erupting all over the culture like a bad rash (the latest: Judith Warner's much-hyped "Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety").
 
  Soon, the people in Rachel's life — from her new potential love interest Max (Simon Baker) to the doctors at the local hospital where Aidan lands with severe hypothermia and purple handprints all over him — start to suspect her of abusing the boy. Even Evelyn (Spacek), Samara's birth mother, who has been institutionalized since she tried to drown the newborn Samara, the baby who never slept, keeps exhorting Rachel to "be a good mother" and "listen to her baby."
 
  No wonder Rachel's tense — haunted by a nightmare child who never sleeps, who forced her to give up her Seattle condo and derail her career, who keeps demanding they spend time together watching cartoons and who killed two highly attractive potential sex partners in a relatively short period of time, she just can't face the social taint of court-declared unfit motherhood.
 
  In Rachel, Watts just may have found the spiritual descendant of Sigourney Weaver's Ripley, who rebelled against a computer named "Mother" in "Alien" and battled an alien mother to save her child in the sequel. When Ripley bellowed, "Get away from her, you [bleep]," it was an '80s zinger with a decidedly first-wave feminist flavor. Rachel fights for her son too, but her rallying quip sums up the zeitgeist with the slightly more defensive and self-preserving "I'm not your [bleeping] mommy!"
 
  If the laughter in the audience is anything to go by, it may have struck a nerve.

  In general release.   

The way it usually works in a horror sequel is, some foolish teenager who hasn't learned from experience  even though half his buddies have expired under gruesome circumstances  does something dumb (again) like walk into a dark place alone or pick up a telephone and follow the instructions of a maniac. Teenagers make poor choices (and therefore good horror-flick patsies) because that's what teens are wired to do as they test the thrills and dangers of adult sexuality: They go back for more while their audience warns, Don't! The scariest thing in the not-scary-enough The Ring Two  is the notion that even smart, attractive adults  yikes, even mothers  just never learn, either. They may mean well. But in trying to have it all  career, personal life, toned abs, home-cooked dinner with the brood  women inevitably fall down on the job. And therein lies hell for the children, aggravated by the harmful effects of that mechanical mommy: the TV screen.
At least I think that's what The Ring Two  is saying, when stripped of its baroque, now less-than-novel visual tics. And for a horror flick founded upon such an arresting concept as contagion via technological consumerism, that's a pretty dumb follow-up. Having survived the curse of the world's scariest videotape a few years back in The Ring , and subsequently skedaddled from Seattle to the vaunted safety of a smaller Oregon fishing town (as if isolated burgs on the water's edge ever bring anything but terror, rain, and the creepy cawing of gulls), you'd think that investigative reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts again) would at least update her home entertainment equipment and monitor the viewing habits of her son, Aidan (David Dorfman again), more closely. But she doesn't. Apparently, she can't, so consumed is she by guilt about what happened in part 1, when she was a much more work-oriented and less kid-sensitive type. (Watts, who cemented her stardom with The Ring , has always exhibited a certain pared-down efficiency in her performances that can read as hardness, in contrast with her small, soft, vulnerable physical presence.)
Settling into her new job at a newspaper with a puny circulation and poking nervously around a local crime scene involving a dead teenager with a face frozen in a rictus of terror (uh-oh), spongy carpets, and, yes, a mysterious videotape, Rachel makes two gruesome discoveries. First, that DVD technology is slow to arrive in small fishing towns. Second, that the satanically vengeful girl-ghost Samara (Kelly Stables), who made her unhappiness so vividly known by the end of the first movie, is on a tear again  and she knows where Rachel and Aidan live. (The new DVD edition of The Ring  includes a nifty, crisply agitating teens-being-teens short called Rings  that explains how the dead kid in Ring Two  caught the Ring worm in the first place.) And now, in her clumsy attempt to find a place to call home and a mommy to claim as her own, Samara has set her blank-eyed sights on the spot occupied by Aidan.
Much is being made of the fact that this sequel is directed by Hideo Nakata, from whose original Japanese phenomenon, Ringu , director Gore Verbinski fashioned The Ring. Nakata specializes in the modern Japanese art of ''J-Horror,'' with its emphasis on pleasurably anxious anticipation rather than blatantly gory payoff. And in isolated moments of J-style stillness, some of Ring Two 's voluptuous dread is pleasurable: There's a weirdly beautiful, disorienting sequence  in which Rachel, driving Aidan in her single-mom car, is intercepted on a dark road by a convention of deer. And the production team has fun prowling around the banal details of contemporary home life.
But make no mistake, the script by Ehren Kruger (who wrote The Ring  and, before that, Scream 3 ) is a trite American pop story of maternal neurosis. ''Listen to your baby,'' Rachel is told by someone who has learned her lesson the hard way. ''Be a good mother.'' And as if such a guilt trip weren't enough, the frazzled woman is also doubted by a psychiatrist (Elizabeth Perkins) brought in for the sole purpose of humiliating Rachel's parenting skills: The shrink takes one look at the labile Aidan, temporarily pale as death with a body temperature to match, and determines that the boy's distress is the mother's fault. Is it any wonder that in her cornball cameo, Sissy Spacek plays a mad mama just this side of Sylvia Plath? Men barely exist in such a tangled ovarian jungle of guilt, a bottomless well of murky wetness out of which no woman emerges unpunished.

he Ring Two" is the inevitable sequel to "The Ring," which, in turn, was a remake of the wildly influential Japanese horror flick "Ringu." Released in 1998, "Ringu" spawned  several other films and turned its director, Hideo Nakata, into an international brand. It was only a matter of time before Mr. Nakata went Hollywood, and so he has at last as the director of, yes, "The Ring Two," the sequel to the remake of his original hit. (Got that?) Such creative cannibalism is of course part of the pleasure of genre movies, especially horror, where directors like Wes Craven ("Scream")  and Takashi Shimizu ("The Grudge")   return to the scene of the crime to scare up new frights and profits. Good horror, like George Romero's zombie trilogy, works by balancing the reassuringly familiar with the totally unknown: it's like getting tossed in the air as a kid:  you shriek with a mixture of pleasure and fear, and then after you safely land, beg for it to happen again (and again). Sustaining that balance is tough, however, and even the most muscular directors soon grow weary repeating the same old tricks. Mr. Nakata has either become tired of the "Ring" premise - a murdered girl haunts and hunts those unlucky enough to watch her on videotape - or something went seriously awry during production. Whatever the case, despite Mr. Nakata's track record and the radiant presence of its star, Naomi Watts, "The Ring Two" is a dud. Once again, Ms. Watts plays Rachel Keller, a journalist and a single mom to a young son, Aidan (David Dorfman), recently relocated from Seattle to a small coastal town in Oregon. In the first movie, Rachel successfully escaped the marauding ghost in the machine  and now thinks she has entered a new chapter. No such luck; she is actually mucking about on a slag heap of recycled scares, dumb lines and predictable entanglements, including some static with a potential boyfriend replacement (Simon Baker), an encounter with a guest star meant to lend either giggles or gravitas to the proceedings (Sissy Spacek in a fright wig) and a handful of disposable bit players. Once again, blood pools, water flows and the ghost comes calling through the magic of video, scaring to death anyone foolish enough not to have made the move to DVD. The mercurially talented Ms. Watts had to endure an unfair share of humiliation on her road from obscurity, including stinkers like "Tank Girl" and a host of similarly forgettable fare. Since her breakout appearance in David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive" four years ago, she has followed the now standard trajectory that finds certain higher-profile screen actors methodically  alternating between nominally independent boutique items, like "21 Grams," which helped lift Ms. Watts's serious-film profile, and bigger-budget, high-concept entertainments like "The Ring," which are meant to show that she can hold the larger-stakes screen and do the mainstream thing without selling out her talent. Or so the Hollywood thinking seems to go. When this formula pans out, you have a career like that of Ms. Watts's friend Nicole Kidman. When it does not, well, the hall of studio shame is lined with glossies of performers permanently stalled by the usual tabloid woes and too many wrong choices. One of Ms. Watts's current projects is Peter Jackson's remake of "King Kong," and while the real star of that show will be the special effects, the movie should help secure Ms. Watts pop-movie credibility. By the time "King Kong" opens, "The Ring Two" will have rotated to the DVD bargain bin. Meanwhile, here's hoping her handlers begin exhibiting as much prudence as Rachel Keller does in her fight against evil; an actress in Hollywood has a preciously short shelf life, and you can't build a brilliant career with expired goods. "The Ring Two" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film includes some creepy if not particularly scary stuff about parents' killing their children and a couple of "boo!" moments.

The Ring Two" is a half-intriguing, half-tedious follow-up to DreamWorks' 2002 creepy sleeper. Although the franchise has come full circle back into the hands of Hideo Nakata, director of the two original Japanese "Ringu" pics in 1998-99, new item has virtually nothing to do with "Ringu 2." Most importantly, it brings back from the first American installment Naomi Watts, who once again proves her graceful and understated ability to carry a film virtually on her own. Although short on "Grudge"-like shocks, DreamWorks release has enough menacing atmosphere to approach the B.O. totals of its predecessor, which racked up $129 million domestically and $120 mil overseas.
When Gore Verbinsky bowed out of helming this sequel, Nakata grabbed the opportunity to make his first feature in the West (he did docu work while living in the U.K. in the early '90s). Returning scenarist Ehren Kruger, evidently feeling little compulsion to follow the storyline of the smash second Japanese entry, instead worked up a reasonably plausible continuation of his first script that in the beginning minutes neatly disposes of the original's gimmick of teens dying after watching a weird video.
Newspaper reporter Rachel Keller (Watts) has scrammed Seattle with son Aidan (David Dorfman) to seek peace and quiet in Astoria, Ore., a modest-looking seaside burg where she gets a gig on the local paper. When a teenage boy turns up dead and his girlfriend goes catatonic, Rachel realizes the video that terrorized her in Seattle has followed her down the coast.
Subsequent disruptions prove increasingly unnerving: Aidan, a kid whose unrelievedly serious demeanor makes him seem like a little man, takes photographs of himself in a mirror in which the spectral image of Samara, the stringy-haired tyke from the original video, appears to be imposing herself; Aidan's body temperature begins dropping alarmingly; a herd of large-antlered deer surrounds Rachel and Aidan's car in a forest and some of the deer attack the car, and the electricity in the house fritzes out.
Pic's first half concludes with a nifty bathtub set piece, accompanied by "Psycho"-like lunging strings, no less, in which it becomes clear -- if it isn't already -- that Samara intends to claim Aidan for herself, although it takes the remainder of the picture to find out exactly why.
With her son finally hospitalized, Rachel returns to the Seattle area to find out all she can about sinister Samara and her birth mother. The latter is found in a psychiatric hospital, giving Sissy Spacek, in a one-scene cameo that's arguably too brief, a chance to return to horror turf for the first time since "Carrie." In a climax that returns to the bathtub for a sacrificial rite whose Old Testament undercurrents are all the more effective for being unstated, Rachel battles Samara for possession of Aidan's body and soul.
Apart from the sporadic shock sequences that include dream interludes and a very nice desaturated elaboration of the original, quasi-surrealist video, Nakata directs in a precise, low-keyed gear that keeps a firm hand on mood but sometimes stalls out for lack of dramatic energy.
With all characters, save for Rachel, Aidan and Samara, from the first American "Ring" having been jettisoned and scarcely anyone of consequence having replaced them, new film is mostly a two-character piece. As she has repeatedly shown since hitting the big time four years ago, Watts is just as compelling when silent and alone in a scene as she is mixing it up with other actors, making her ideal for an assignment like this in which her character is forced to go it alone amongst newcomers who are necessarily clueless as to how to help her.
Although there are a few lapses in credibility, mainly having to do with characters being left alone in situations that would strongly dictate otherwise, Watts doesn't have to cope with the large question marks that hovered over her character's behavior the first time around. Dorfman paints Aidan as an eerily self-possessed little boy, even as another entity endeavors to possess him.
In briefly are Simon Baker as Rachel's hunky newspaper associate, Elizabeth Perkins as a condescending doctor whose know-it-all attitude is trumped by forces she can't understand, and Gary Cole as a real estate agent blissfully unaware of the bloody past of the property he's peddling.
Production values are modest but sharp. Cinematographer Gabriel Beristain takes his cue from the generally overcast weather and predominant water motifs to ground the film in somber grays, blues and greens. Rick Baker is back to provide imaginatively creepy makeup effects, while the score by Henning Lohner and Martin Tillman is effectively derivative, not only from Hans Zimmer, whose themes from the original "Ring" are credited, but of Bernard Herrmann, Igor Stravinsky, et al.

Will the circle be unbroken? Let's hope not. This poorly conceived sequel to Gore Verbinski 's The Ring  ditches that film's scariest conceitpeople die a week after watching . . . an avant-garde video! for a watery possession plot. Fleeing the gnarliness unleashed in the first movie's Seattle  for small-town life, Rachel (Naomi Watts ) and her weird little son (David Dorfman ) have to fend off bad plumbing, angry deer, and the unshowered ghost girl who keeps ruining his digital photos. Postpartum depression is invoked several times; if the name of the game is to be the unheimlich  maneuvers of the mother-child bond, one wishes Hideo Nakata  (director of the Japanese Ringu  films) could have nudged the proceedings toward the Rosemary's Baby -Birth  axis. (Indeed, there's a brief, wordless melody intended to evoke RB .) Sissy Spacek , as the would-be Andrea Yates  now in the loony bin, is thankfully obscured by a long wig. The let's-travel-through-the-TV-screen sequence was better in Fat Albert  . Next time we'll try call-waiting.
