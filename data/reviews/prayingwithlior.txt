 Shot over three years in a close-knit Jewish  Reconstructionist  community in Philadelphia, “Praying With Lior” documents the extraordinary life of Lior Liebling, a rabbi’s son with Down syndrome and an obsessive love of prayer.  While family and friends marvel over Lior’s putative spirituality, the director, Ilana Trachtman, captures a larger story. As the Lieblings engage in exhaustive preparations for Lior’s bar mitzvah, we see a sweet-natured, high-functioning young man enjoy a level of assimilation — and attention — granted to few of the mentally disabled. A near-celebrity within his neighborhood, Lior seems unaware of his real-world limitations — a fact that worries his stepmother, Lynne Iser, though not his father, Mordechai.  Patiently and delicately, Ms. Trachtman teases out the tricky dynamics of a family dealing with a disabled child. Lior’s devoted brother, Yoni,  sometimes resents being expected to take on parental responsibilities (“This is not my job”), while his older sister, Reena, recalls becoming a surrogate mother after the death of their mother in 1997.  Most touching  is the 11-year-old Anna, who, as the youngest, laments her displacement as the center of attention. “It’s kind of annoying,” she tells us with charming candor. And watching everything in the household revolve around Lior, it’s clear that the price of his happiness may be steeper for some than for others.

Amid an escalating U.S. trend toward commercial entertainment that earnestly or exploitatively taps religious demographics, "Praying With Lior" explores a rather extraordinary instance of real-world faith, sans condescension or proselytizing. Fascinating documentary focuses on the phenomenon of rabbi's son Lior Liebing, a boy with Down syndrome considered a "spiritual genius" for his boundless enthusiasm for prayer and professed close communication with God. What makes this involving beyond its subject's slightly freakish fascination is helmer Ilana Trachtman's capturing of a complex family dynamic in which Lior isn't the only intriguing personality. Fest, broadcast and possible limited theatrical play are signaled.
Present here in poignant homemovies and diary excerpts, Devorah Bartnoff Liebing was a mother of four and, like her husband, a rabbi.
She died of cancer in 1997, when Lior was 6 years old. Since then, Mordechai Liebling has remarried, giving the kids a dedicated stepmom in Lynne Iser. But the somewhat hard-driving dad seems to expect everyone to help parent Lior, who does need a lot of caretaking. Eldest Reena (now at college) was a surrogate mom and babysitter after Devorah's death. High schooler Yoni philosophically acknowledges the responsibility of being Lior's "best friend" means he will likely go to college -- and even spend his whole adult life -- within commuting distance of little bro. (Another Liebling son, Ben, does not appear here.)
The family's self-sacrifice is admirable. Still, it's refreshing when youngest child Anna frankly complains that Lior's "specialness" means she never gets to be the center of attention.
Lior is indeed special, as an exceptionally high-functioning Down syndrome child -- quick-witted, cheerful, a jokester, at times unusually wise for his age. Yet he's also stubborn, speech-defected (his words are subtitled) and otherwise clearly disabled. What has made him unusual even among similarly better-abled Down kids is a love of "davening" (prayer), which has made him an inspiring leader -- in spoken word and bellowingly atonal song -- to both Hebrew school classmates (who grudgingly accept him as an inept teammate in sports) and synagogue members. He seems to palpably feel God's presence, though he refuses to answer direct questions about what that is like.
One community member, not unkindly, suggests the "beaming faces" that greeted Lior's vocal religious expressions from an early age are their real cause. Yet Lior doesn't seem capable of calculation. (He can, however, be rather cruel in his frank assessments of others.) Early on, Yoni says, "I don't know if there's a God, but if there is, Lior is closer to Him than anyone I know," which sums things up nicely.
Narrative momentum is provided by all the preparations for Lior's bar mitzvah. It's attended by 300, with Mordechai almost levitating with pride in the front row as Lior "really rises to the occasion" at the podium. Still, one might well judge most powerfully sympathetic figures here to be Lynne and Yoni, patient background players whose generosity is deeply affecting. Closing-credits seg is a crowd-pleasing delight.
These people are so interesting, and Trachtman's handling so intimate and involving, that it would be very welcome if she revisited the family every so often, "Up"-style. Zelda Greenstein's deft editing and Andy Statman's klezmer-influenced acoustic score are package standouts.

At the press screening of Praying With Lior , many of the critics around me openly sobbed. This doc is a hardcore tearjerker. Its subject is a Jewish boy with Down syndrome preparing for his Bar Mitzvah; Lior Liebling  enjoys leading others in prayer so much that he is known as the Little Rebbe. His mother died of breast cancer when he was six, and director Ilana Trachtman  milks the boys honest, simple sorrow for all its worth. We get ample footage of Mommy Devora singing with Lior , playing with Lior, and, yes, praying with Lior. Trachtmans movie is not technically accomplishedthe camerawork is run-of-the-mill, the structure is ramblingbut its redeemed by the deliciously complex, practically Balzac-ian family at its center. Liors father, Mordechai, is a prominent rabbi who demands a great deal from his son even as he adores him. Stepmother Lynne is devoted to Lior, but her place among the Lieblings seems precarious and hard-won. Liors siblings are thoughtful and frank about the challenges of living with their brother and longing for their mother. Everyone still reels from the loss of Devora, whose fierce love for both her children and her religion dominates the film, almost against the familys will. I would have liked to see Trachtman focus more on these dynamics and less on Liors sunny, prayerful disposition. He is undoubtedly a charmer, but this is a kid with limited verbal abilitieshes retarded, as his father bluntly puts itand Trachtmans prodding, leading questions make the endeavor distinctly uncomfortable. At times, the film dances perilously close to painting him as a holy fool, rather than a boy who loves to pray and lives to please.
