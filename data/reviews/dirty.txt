         "Today is the day" is a refrain repeated throughout the troublesome corrupt-cop drama "Dirty," a fictional response to the LAPD's Rampart scandal. It's the day that undercover officers Armando Sancho (Clifton Collins Jr.) and Salim Adel (Cuba Gooding Jr.) don their blues to face an internal affairs investigation over a shooting in which an old man was killed.
 
  It's also the day Sancho must choose whether to take a deal from IA and rat out all the dirty deeds perpetuated in his unit or stay true to his colleagues. If that isn't enough to mess with Sancho's mind, he keeps hallucinating, seeing the dying old man's face wherever he turns.
 


         






    A lot happens in this day-in-the-life movie, but it's oddly uninvolving. Director Chris Fisher, who scripted along with Gil Reavill and Eric Saks, has fashioned a withering view of Los Angeles and especially the police department. These aren't rogue cops, it's an entire rogue force.
 
  The anti-gang unit to which Sancho and Adel are attached reeks of corruption from the captain (Keith David) and lieutenant (Cole Hauser) on down. No sooner do the partners finish the morning briefing then they are sent on an assignment from the lieutenant to hook up with Brax (Wood Harris), the representative of a drug lord named Baine (Wyclef Jean, with a Caribbean accent so thick it's subtitled).
 
  Are they being set up or will this deal enrich their coffers and earn the loyalty of their betters?
 
  In addition to the specter of the old man pursuing him, ex-gang member Sancho is being choked by a sudden onset of conscience that distances him from his partner as the day digresses. Collins ("Traffic," "Capote"), good as always, delivers what back story there is via narration. Gooding has his best role in years, even if it seems like a warm-up for "Training Day 2."
 
  Fisher's L.A. is blanched and choked with smog, mirroring Sancho's lack of clarity and the muddled opportunities for redemption. The film winds a gerrymandered path from downtown to Venice, snaking through the most menacing, fractured-concrete sections of town. All the flash-and-burn stylization begins to wear as Sancho and Adel beat a dangerous and bloody trail, and "Dirty" begins to look like "Cops" on crack.
 
  As good as the leads and the supporting cast are, and as much action as gets packed into the film's relatively brief running time, none of it draws us in dramatically. The unending barrage of crosses and double-crosses and over-plotting frustrate what might have been an epic conflict between two cops on divergent moral trajectories.

The rotten cops in the baroque urban downer drama Dirty  treat their hometown of Los Angeles like hell. Literally, like a place of damnation, where all hope is lost, and no boundaries separate those sworn to uphold the law from those who break it. Of course, because this is movie SoCal, and crooked LAPD partners Salim Adel (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Armando Sancho (Clifton Collins Jr.) patrol streets that have already received memorable lessons in visual style from Training Day , Crash , and Collateral , hell is paved with edgy, desaturated colors, jittery camera swings, nervous flashbacks, and fancy image pushing; in this art-designed dystopia, every gangster's got style. (Wyclef Jean and the hip-hopper Taboo play kingpins.) But at the end of the antiheroes' ropes, at the end of writer-director Chris Fisher's genre exercise, guns have been drawn, blood has been spilled, cops have been thwarted from going straight, and nothing has changed.
That's the real hell of Dirty , the sin that damns it to inconsequence: Nuthin' affects nobody, from the gangs running dope to the antigang unit's brutal street tactics to the top brass (Keith David and Cole Hauser) who simultaneously offer Adel and Sancho protection and set them up. Everything's window dressing. Much is made (at least between themselves) of the fact that the duo in blue consists of ''a bean and a nigger''  Sancho himself is a former gang member while Adel is simply an amoral mofo with a taste for boosting the expensive gadgets of the citizens he waylays. (He also sexually molests a female motorist while her male companion looks on helplessly, a play of degradation that feels cribbed from the Crash  handbook.) But when the florid speeches of volcanic rage and frustration draw to a close  and when Collins (the memorable Perry Smith in Capote ) and Gooding (an actor here reinvigorated by the indie-film chance to hurl obscenities after a run of studio pap) complete their acting exercises  we still have no clue who these men are and what sent them down their intersecting moral dark alleys.
''This is the day, cuz,'' Adel assures Sancho, the two of them jawing about making one last big splash before getting out of the racket. Nope, in the smog of Dirty , this is just a day.

 In "Dirty," a nasty little genre film about corrupt cops in the Los Angeles Police Department's anti-gang task force, Cuba Gooding Jr. sheds the halo that has threatened to strangle his career and makes a desperate leap to the bad side. His character, Salim Adel, is so loathsome he makes Matt Dillon's Officer Ryan in "Crash" look as cuddlesome as a neutered house cat. But if Mr. Gooding's break from Mr. Nice Guy allows him to kick over the traces and play the bully, his inner teddy bear keeps getting in the way of his outer rat.  Adel gleefully harasses and humiliates white drivers in fancy cars who have gotten lost. In the most sickening scene, he manually rapes the girlfriend of a teenage skateboarder. After that, you wait for this rotten egg to be smashed in the gutter and flushed into the ninth circle of hell.  The story, apparently inspired by the Rampart scandal, follows Adel and his not-quite-so-hateful Mexican-American partner Armando Sancho (Clifton Collins Jr.) through an especially stressful day. Sancho, a former gang member, is so haunted by the shooting of an innocent bystander at a crime scene that he has premonitory flashes of the victim's corpse coming back to curse him. Unbeknownst to Adel, he has decided to confess his crimes to Internal Affairs.  All the eggs in the partners' unit turn out to be rotten, including their bosses, the thundering, authoritarian Captain Spain (Keith David) and his weaselly lieutenant (Cole Hauser). When the lieutenant asks the partners to remove a bag of heroin from the evidence room as part of a scheme that could make everybody rich, Adel jumps at the opportunity while Sancho has misgivings.  The operation, which the muddled screenplay fails to clarify, is just an excuse for the movie to lurch dizzily through the Los Angeles underworld, guns popping to a hip-hop soundtrack, as competing black and Mexican hierarchies in the drug trade go at each other.  And what is the civics lesson being taught? As Sancho declares in an introductory voice-over, the only thing separating gangbangers from the police is a badge. "Dirty," directed by Chris Fisher ("Nightstalker"), is a facile exercise in nihilism posing as an indie "Training Day" with street cred. Don't believe it.  "Dirty" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It is violent, sadistic and jam-packed with profanity.

The cop genre receives a shot of adrenaline in helmer Chris Fisher's "Dirty," a no-nonsense dramatic response to the LAPD Rampart scandals of the '90s. Pairing a transformed Cuba Gooding Jr. and Fisher favorite Clifton Collins Jr. as morally compromised beat cops enduring a bad day on the streets is just the start of film's smart moves. By handing theatrical release reins (for spring opening) to exec producer Ash Shah's Silver Nitrate, Sony has missed an opportunity to earn serious coin with a pic that should have terrific crossover appeal among multicultural aud niches, though studio (which holds vid rights) will enjoy bang-bang ancillary returns. 
Though it was never conceived as the finale of a trilogy, Fisher's latest completes a rough and very raw cycle of Los Angeles crime movies, starting with true-life serial killer dramas "Nightstalker" and "Hillside Strangler." While he retains certain touches of shock and horror -- along with a decibel-busting soundtrack -- from earlier pics, Fisher takes huge strides forward in "Dirty," fashioning a complex morality drama that overshadows films with similar themes from "Training Day" and "Crash" to "Dark Blue."
�Collins' Officer Sancho narrates, in classic Los Angeles cop fiction style, the story of his dangerous transformation from gangbanger to cop. But on a sunny, yet grimy, day (brilliantly and seamlessly lensed in smog-stained color by Eliot Rockett and Danny Minnick), Sancho is on the brink of coming clean with LAPD's Internal Affairs department about his involvement in drug-related corruption in his division, led by Capt. Spain (Keith David).
Sancho's partner Adel (Gooding), so thoroughly corrupt that his upside-down nametag is a symbol of his rottenness, has no idea that Sancho is talking to IA cops, who are also investigating Sancho for accidentally killing a bystander during a shootout.
�Spain, along with his nefarious Lieutenant (Cole Hauser), view the gang-infested streets as a war zone where any tactic is suitable, even if it includes ordering Sancho and Adel to remove a 13-kilo bag of heroin from an evidence room to frame Canadians horning in on the business of drug kingpin Baine (Wyclef Jean). Sancho rightly views the assignment as rife with traps, but he can't control Adel's urges to harass and abuse civilians, from white out-of-towners to Venice homies.
For a movie that stays true to its low-budget roots as a decidedly prol genre work, "Dirty" draws a vast panorama of Los Angeles street life and the similar hierarchies that rule black and Mexican gangs as well as the LAPD. There's always some higher authority to answer to, just as there's always another hidden agenda designed to bushwhack the unsuspecting foot soldiers, whether or not they wear a badge. It's this parallel of criminal and law enforcement elements, along with its pointed portrait of non-Anglo cop partners on quite different moral paths, that distinguishes pic from other recent genre works.
�Just as a certain fate seemed to hang over the serial killers in his previous thrillers, a dark cloud looms over Fisher's cops here. This inevitability unfolds with genuinely tragic power, not only because of Fisher's confidence in his material but also because of Gooding and Collins' lusty embrace of their roles.
Collins adds to his fascinating gallery of portraits of bad men -- or, in this case, extremely flawed men -- internally tortured by their actions, but Gooding is a revelation. His Adel is a nasty and self-hating cop who has been so undone by what he's witnessed on the beat. It's just the tonic for an actor who has drifted into too many goody-goody roles since "Jerry Maguire."
Supporting cast is studded with extremely vivid perfs, including the always magnetic David in his best role in years, Jean in colorful overdrive (and speaking a Jamaican patois that's subtitled) and Robert LaSardo dominating a finale sequence rife with unbearable tension.
Pic looks and sounds fabulous, with Fisher showing off his love of soundtracks layered with noise, quiet and bone-rattling music. Los Angeles is a major star in the film, and with no iconic or familiar sights on view, it's framed as only a local is able to.

Considering the stock quality of the insights that the cop drama Dirty  has to offer us about Los Angeles (e.g., "This fucking city, I never could make sense of it"), it could easily have been shot in Vancouver  without any sacrifice in verisimilitude. If writer-director Chris Fisher , a Southern California native, insisted on staying local, he might at least have saved some money by renting that backlot used for a downtown intersection in Crash . No less than Crash  or Training Day , its more obvious model, this post-Rampart study of LAPD corruption takes place in a movie-set Los Angeles where people bellow didactically about race. Cuba Gooding Jr.  and Clifton Collins Jr.  (excellent as Perry Smith  in Capote ) habitually rise above their clichéd roles as shady narc partnersa "nigger" and a "bean"dreading their 6 p.m. appointment with internal affairs. But Fisher, who has a penchant for area serial killers (The Nightstalker  and the forthcoming Rampage: The Hillside Strangler Murders ), appears fixated on Los Angeles as a nihilistic phantasmagoria. For all its nominal grit, Dirty  lamentably has more in common with L.A. Story  than Boyz n the Hood .
