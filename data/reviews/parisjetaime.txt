 “Paris Je T’Aime,” a mosaic of 18 miniatures, each set in a different location in the City of Light, is a cinematic tasting menu consisting  entirely of amuse-bouches. After two hours of such tidbits the palate is sated. But if there is no need for a main course, you still leave feeling vaguely disappointed at not being served  one.  The movie could be described as a cinematically literate travel brochure: The Eiffel Tower sparkles, the parks are lush and green, and the banks of the Seine are an inviting lovers’ rendezvous. But the Paris we see is not so prettified that it looks and feels unreal, and the pace is hectic; this is a whirlwind tour.  The directors’ credits for this deluxe sampler come from all over: France (Olivier Assayas, Sylvain Chomet) of course, but also Brazil (Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas), Spain (Isabel Coixet), Japan (Nobuhiro Suwa), Mexico (Alfonso Cuarón) and Germany (Tom Tykwer). The United States is most heavily represented, with shorts by Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant, the Coen Brothers, Richard LaGravenese and Wes Craven.  Among the international cast of actors serving up the delicacies are Natalie Portman, Maggie Gyllenhaal, Fanny Ardant, Elijah Wood, Nick Nolte, Bob Hoskins, Juliet Binoche, Gena Rowlands, Steve Buscemi, Gérard Depardieu and Ben Gazzara.  Most of the vignettes flow into one another, as though the stories are all leading somewhere, which they don’t really do. The simpler stories are generally more effective than the elaborate ones. In the Coen brothers’ sharp little comedy “Tuileries,” set in a station of the Paris Métro, a nervous American tourist (Mr. Buscemi), guidebook in hand, lands in trouble by not following its advice to avoid eye contact. Observing a lovers’ quarrel on the opposite platform, he is verbally harassed by the young man;  later  the couple cross to his side and thoroughly humiliate him. Mr. Buscemi, who speaks not a word, uses his wide, buggy eyes and elastic features like a silent clown to register shades of discomfort.  In “Loin du 16ème,” written and directed by Mr. Salles and Ms. Thomas, a struggling immigrant mother leaves her baby in a nursery  and journeys to the heart of Paris to work as a nanny for a wealthy family. She soothes the peevish infant in her care with the same refrain she sang to her own child hours earlier.  In Ms. Coixet’s “Bastille,” which compares caretaking to passion, a husband (Sergio Castellitto) is about to ask his wife of many years (Miranda Richardson) for a divorce when she bursts into tears and announces she is dying of leukemia.  In Oliver Schmitz’s “Place des Fêtes,” a young medic (Aïssa Maïga) has a profound encounter with an immigrant (Seydou Boro) from Lagos who is dying on a street corner after being stabbed by a hoodlum. Mr. Craven’s “Père-Lachaise” observes a bickering couple, engaged to be married, who break up and make up in front of Oscar Wilde’s grave with a little help from  Wilde’s sympathetic ghost.  In “Quartier Latin” Mr. Gazzara and Ms. Rowlands play an about-to-divorce couple exchanging sniping words in jocular tones; you feel the anger that can’t be camouflaged. Written by Ms. Rowlands and directed by Frédéric Auburtin and Mr. Depardieu, who has a tiny role as a restaurant owner, it is a gem of multilayered acting.  In the lovely final story, “14ème Arrondissement,” directed by Mr. Payne, Margo Martindale plays a middle-aged postal worker from Denver alone in Paris on her dream vacation. Her voice-over, an epistolary interior monologue delivered in a French spoken  with an amusingly flat American twang, describes a happy-sad epiphany.  These stories are the most satisfying pieces in the anthology.  Other selections stumble over themselves in their attempts to be original. Christopher Doyle’s “Porte de Choisy,” in which a salesman of hair products visits a Chinese beauty parlor, is a colorful but convoluted spoof of martial arts and television commercials.  Mr. Chomet’s “Tour Eiffel” is the kind of mime show that  only the French could entirely take to  their hearts, and Mr. Suwa’s “Place des Victoires” is an awkward supernatural cowboy fantasy with Willem Dafoe on horseback. The biggest misfire, Vincenzo Natali’s “Quartier de la Madeleine,” is a romantic horror fantasy starring Elijah Wood as a besotted vampire lover that is photographed in muted tones  — except for the blood.  For this kind of omnibus movie a success rate of two out of three is a pretty high batting average. There are no home runs, however, only doubles, singles and coy little bunts.  “Paris Je T’Aime” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations.
Twenty different directors tackle 18 of Paris' most distinctive neighborhoods with close to 20-20 artistic vision in "Paris je t'aime." Omnibus -- with the City of Lights as its milieu and love as its raison d'etre -- is uneven but quite pleasant as a two-hour experience that acknowledges the idealized Paris people carry in their heads while wisely veering off the beaten track. International roster of helmers, most of them working with local techies, assures warranted curiosity among the film-savvy -- the lure of Paris itself should do the rest. Pic opens in Gaul June 21 following its Un Certain Regard preem at Cannes.
Picture postcard overviews establish the ambient beauty quotient of Paris. They are followed by capsule views in a tic-tac-toe split screen format.
Fears that the venture might be a series of glorified ads quickly dissipate as good actors portraying (mostly) real people are given the figurative floor. Each seg, set in one of the neighborhoods within the city's official administrative districts, is pinpointed with the name of the vicinity and the corresponding director superimposed over an establishing shot.
Each seg was written or co-written by its helmer, except "Quartier Latin," which was penned by Gena Rowlands but co-helmed by Gerard Depardieu and Frederic Auburtin. Most are in French, with three in English and a few a mixture of the two languages.
Some installments boast definite punchlines, while others capture a mood or offer up an open-ended slice of life.
The 18 episodes have been strung together in an order that feels right, balanced about as well as can be hoped for with no real narrative cement except the umbrella brief to make a five minute love story in the assigned quarter.
With a light touch and an eye for the glories of a sunny day, Gurinder Chadha offers a pitch-perfect commentary on the idiocy of religious and racial stereotyping in "Quais de Seine." Steve Buscemi's majestic schleppiness� anchors Joel and Ethan Coen's comic slam dunk in "Tuileries," set in the Metro station of that name.
On the infinitely more poignant front, Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas paint a wrenching portrait of the gulf between a poor immigrant servant's (Catalina Sandino Moreno) experience of motherhood and that of her employer in "Loin du 16eme."� "Bastille" is Isabelle Coixet's intensely bittersweet take on a man (Sergio Castellitto) about to leave his wife (Miranda Richardson) for his mistress (Leonor Watling).
The power of even the briefest of human interactions and the fall-out of being in the wrong place at the wrong time are communicated with depth and economy in "Place des Fetes" by Olivier Schmitz. Olivier Assayas' "Quartier des Enfants Rouges" is like a revisiting of helmer's "Irma Vep" a decade later, with a few notes borrowed from "Clean."
In "Tour Eiffel," Sylvain Chomet, the gifted animator of "The Triplettes of Belleville" fame, lenses live actors for the first time, imbuing them with much of the off-kilter humor that's his trademark. "Cube" helmer Vicenzo Natali's ominously scored and dialogue-free vampire riff "Quartier de la Madeleine" doesn't really jell despite an earnest perf by Elijah Wood but proves an amusing lead-in to Wes Craven's "Pere-Lachaise." Although viewers might expect something sinister, Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell inhabit a sweetly spirited look at how the dead can goose the living.
A freshly beefed up Gaspard Ulliel delivers a frank and yearning monologue to a printshop staffer (Elias McConnell) in Gus Van Sant's "Le Marais." Lensing is more conventional than the dreamy-yet-controlled meanderings of Van Sant's last few features. Blink and you'll miss Marianne Faithful. 
Christopher Doyle's ambitious genre-melee, "Porte de Choisy" is set in Chinatown but all over the map as Barbet Schroeder plays a hair care products rep.
Alfonso Cuaron plays with sound, space and viewer assumptions in a long tracking shot with a mild twist as his camera follows Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier in "Parc Monceau." Fanny Ardant and Bob Hoskins play a couple unsure just how theatrical their sex lives should be in Richard LaGravanese's piquant if uneven "Pigalle."
Weakest -- but still watchable -- entries are Bruno Podalydes' harmlessly amusing "Montmartre"; Nobuhiro Suwa's overwrought look at parental grief, "Place des Victoires" starring Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe; and Tom Tykwer's "Faubourg Saint-Denis" which chronicles a sudden glitch in the storybook romance between a blind French student of languages (Melchior Beslon) and an American actress (Natalie Portman).
Rowlands and Ben Gazzara get excellent mileage out of a cafe appointment with edgy yet affectionate sparring in "Quartier Latin."
Alexander Payne skillfully condenses the tone of his feature work into the closing seg, "14th Arrondissement," in which Margo Martindale shines as a middle-aged letter carrier from Denver narrating her solo trip to Paris in French.
Interstitial shots of Paris and coda in which certain characters cross paths don't add much and veer dangerously close to saccharine. But project -- four years in the making --avoided most pitfalls and turned out better than average.

Paris, Je T'aime 's brimming declaration of love to the City of Lights leaves one breathless but dissatisfied. Paris's quartiers  and the rainbow coalition of people who inhabit them are the connective tissue for this spotty omnibus's 18 segments; five minutes each, these trifles come and go before they've registered in the mind. Only Tom Tykwer  attempts to redress this constraint by evoking a blind man's romance with an actress as a spastic glitch in time. Isabelle Coixet  and Nobuhiro Suwa 's contributions are endearingly bittersweet suck-ups to love and death, but both treat the Paris setting as superfluous. Sylvain Chomet , Olivier Assayas , and Alexander Payne  more sensitively consider the feelings of elation the city can rouse, while Oliver Schmitz  conveys the complex politics of Paris's racial diversity with a heft and economy that evades Walter Salles  and Daniela Thomas . Leave it to the Coen brothers  to show everyone up with their acerbic Tuileries  , in which Steve Buscemi 's encounter with a hellish couple inside a Metro station slyly hints at a raison d'être for the Mona Lisa's smilea symbol for the transfixing allure of the most beautiful city in the world.
