         No matter how meaningless, scary or banal someone else's dream may seem to you, once you've seen "My Date With Drew," you will be forced to grudgingly, reluctantly admit that the single-minded pursuit and implementation of that dream is still an admirable thing.
 
  More of a video diary with guest stars than a documentary, "My Date With Drew" chronicles regular guy Brian Herzlinger's perversely awkward attempts to land a date with his elementary school crush, Drew Barrymore, whom he had seen in "E.T. The Extraterrestrial" when both were children.
 


         






    It plays less creepy on-screen than it sounds, at least in part because Herzlinger is an extremely likable guy and he goes to great lengths to avoid appearing to be a stalker. The film shares similarities with Morgan Spurlock's "Supersize Me" in that its set-up includes a ticking clock of 30 days (the time remaining before Herzlinger has to return the credit card-purchased video camera to Circuit City for a no-hassle refund), a limited budget (the $1,100 Herzlinger won on a game show where the answer was, ta-dum, "Drew Barrymore") and a tone of pure, true-believer salesmanship.
 
  Abetted by co-directors and fellow Ithaca College alums Jon Gunn and Brett Winn along with producer Kerry David, Herzlinger sets out on his quest with the kind of focus usually found in Zen masters or Comicon attendees.
 
  If any of the quartet, who collectively came to be known as the Drew Crew, ever read Nathanael West's "The Day of the Locust," they surely chose to ignore its darker warnings, instead embracing the mantra that Hollywood is a place where dreams come true. But not everyone was in Herzlinger's corner. When told of the idea, his mentor and friend, Bill D'Elia, proclaims, "The dumbing of America is complete," and even Herzlinger's mother refers to Barrymore unfavorably and tells him he should try to date a "real person."
 
  Nothing, however, will deter the crew from their grail. Herzlinger enlists a personal trainer, a facialist (the same one Drew uses) and a psychic, gets a makeover and sneaks into the after-party of the "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" premiere. At one point a Drew look-alike is hired to allow Herzlinger a practice run should he actually land the date. Whether connecting the dots or eliminating the degrees of separation leading to Ms. Barrymore, the filmmakers exhaust each lead resourcefully testing legal boundaries while creating some fairly comic and often touching moments.
 
  Although its reality TV premise begs to be mocked and a deep thought would die of loneliness within its cult-of-celebrity incubator of self-indulgence, "My Date With Drew" defies all reason to emerge as an inspiring, feel-good romantic comedy. It should come as no surprise that the Drew Crew shared a dream of being feature filmmakers — Herzlinger's idol is Steven Spielberg — and there's something satisfying about the pursuit of a pipe dream resulting in the achievement of another, larger goal.

A movie that would scarcely deserve a place on the bottom shelf of reality TV, My Date With Drew  is an act of petty self-promotional chutzpah disguised as self-mockery. Its featured putz, Brian Herzlinger, is one of those charmless gasbag hustlers who fill up the background of every third party in L.A. Armed with  $1,100 and a video camera, Herzlinger spends 30 days trying to penetrate the walls of showbiz flackery so that he can get a date with Drew Barrymore, his lifelong celebrity crush. Along the way, we're expected to find this ''nice Jewish boy'' adorable as he pesters his industry contacts, gets his blackheads squeezed by a facialist, and sings ''Walking on Sunshine,'' all the while stealing looks into the camera so we can see how funny he finds himself. (At least someone's laughing.) My Date With Drew  is stupefyingly tedious and annoying, since even Herzlinger's fixation on Barrymore comes off as a quasi-sham. What he really craves is a date with fame, a mistress destined to stand him up.

We've all met brash, loudmouthed go-getters like Brian Herzlinger, the garrulous fuzzball who narrates the personal documentary "My Date With Drew." When such people zero in on someone they want to know, they are often relentless in their pursuit. If they possess the charm to match their aggressiveness, chances are they will eventually wear down their prey. If they don't, pushiness can turn into intimidation and pursuit into stalking; then it's time to call the police. Fortunately, Mr. Herzlinger, who directed his home movie with Jon Gunn and Brett Winn, is a reasonably likable guy. His screen presence, however, takes some getting used to. For the first 45 minutes of a cinematic stunt in which he invites us to be witnesses as he tries to meet his childhood heartthrob, Drew Barrymore, his obnoxiousness outweighs his charm. But in the second half of the movie, when he finally collapses into an excitable grown-up baby, his charm wins out. His quest begins when he wins $1,100 on a game show pilot by giving the right answer, "Drew Barrymore," to a question posed in the final round and impulsively decides to squander the prize money by making a film documenting his campaign to meet this star. He gives himself a deadline of 30 days to succeed. Lacking the funds for a digital video camera, he uses a friend's credit card at Circuit City to buy one, which he plans to use and then return under the store's 30-day free trial policy. Early in the film, Mr. Herzlinger declares that he has had a crush on Ms. Barrymore since he was 6. He immediately begins trying to contact everyone who has had any kind of professional relationship with her and sends a 30-second trailer for his project to her production company. As his movie-in-progress goes along, his pursuit of a childhood dream looks increasingly like an excuse by a canny aspiring filmmaker to create a work sample. The facade of a brash, sad-sack clown that he presents to the camera seems as shrewdly calculated as Michael Moore's working-class everyman; it's shtick. Mr. Herzlinger holds a casting call for Drew Barrymore look-alikes and takes the winner on a trial date to a restaurant from which he scrounges a free meal. He pesters an old girlfriend over the phone for dating tips. He has his blackheads squeezed out by Ms. Barrymore's facialist and frets about his hirsute appearance. When her new movie, "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle," has its Hollywood premiere, he has a friend design fake passes to the after-party. "My Date With Drew" is a revealing examination of the protective shell that surrounds Hollywood royalty. But as we become better acquainted with Mr. Herzlinger, it seems obvious that he and Hollywood are made for each other; a streak of shameless, go-for-broke exhibitionism is almost a job requirement. There would probably be no movie if Mr. Herzlinger didn't eventually realize his dream. America's sweetheart, when she finally appears, is in full command of her sweetly ditzy screen personality. She and Mr. Herzlinger are eternal children and kindred spirits, both under the spell of celluloid fairy dust; they really do understand each other. "My Date With Drew" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has strong language.

What starts off as a self-serving promotional exercise takes on almost unreasonably charming dimensions in "My Date With Drew." The story of filmmaker Brian Herzlinger's personal quest to score a date with his idol Drew Barrymore in 30 days or less, this maddening yet deftly made, and finally disarming, documentary comes through with enough heart and hilarity to sell its celebrity-stalking shenanigans to genuinely moving effect. Already a crowd-pleaser on the festival circuit, where it won the HBO Comedy Arts Fest's audience award, "Drew" could be a real draw for arthouse and mainstream auds, not least Barrymore's multitudinous fans.
Buttressed by a shrewd marketing campaign (as soon becomes clear, the movie is
 a marketing campaign), docu is sure to at least recoup its budget of $1,100, which Herzlinger won on a gameshow pilot. (The prophetic winning answer? Drew Barrymore.)
Otherwise broke and unemployed, Herzlinger teamed with film school buddies Jon Gunn and Brett Winn, bought a digital video camera and, banking on Circuit City's 30-day return policy, gave himself a month to meet the actress he's had a crush on since seeing "E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial" at the age of 6.
Not without Hollywood connections, the trio (who directed, produced and took turns filming and editing) take a "six degrees of separation" approach to their quarry. They interview anyone and everyone with even a tangential relationship to Barrymore, including such obliging Hollywood types as Corey Feldman, Eric Roberts (who advises Herzlinger to put on some muscle) and "Charlie's Angels" screenwriter John August.
Simultaneously, Herzlinger and producer Kerry David repeatedly call the Barrymore camp as well as her Flower Films production shingle to try to get the actress to simply watch a 30-second trailer for the project. Pic becomes a study of the impenetrability of Hollywood, not to mention its inefficiency, frequent miscommunication and flat-out laziness.
Like so many ostensibly nonfiction films, "My Date With Drew" is a chronicle of its own making (it even keeps a running tally of the dwindling budget). Recognizably linked to the aggressive, personality-driven documentaries of Michael Moore and Morgan Spurlock, it is also, quite consciously, Herzlinger's attempt to break into the film biz, and it's not always clear which goal -- love or money -- is his top priority.
Onscreen for the entire film and an endearing presence for most of it, Herzlinger is goofily good-looking, with a wide-open grin and a permanent 5 o'clock shadow that give the impression of a rosy-cheeked clown. He's also chronically anxious and makes quite a show of his insecurity, never passing up an opportunity to point out what a freak he is (lifting his shirt multiple times, for example, to show off acres of chest hair) in ways that are rather too obvious as both comedy and a bid for sympathy.
Some of the interview subjects seem to have been dragged on merely to indulge Herzlinger, mop up his self-pity and shower praise on his high-concept premise. (Offering a contradictory blast of fresh air is his outspoken mother, who dismisses both the project and Barrymore with a priceless, "I think she's a slut!")
Fortunately, pic improves immeasurably as it goes along, delivering a handful of terrifically inspired comic sequences, including a casting call for Drew look-alikes that goes hysterically awry. There's also a climactic moment when Herzlinger sneaks into the premiere of "Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle" using a fake pass -- a brilliant scene that allows Herzlinger, Gunn and Winn to display tremendous filmmaking chops on the fly.
Their secret weapon turns out to be Barrymore herself, who is every bit as luminous as this cinematic shrine would lead one to expect. An actress with seemingly effortless screen chemistry, she's the inspiration for Herzlinger's best, most guileless performance.
Aside from the sound work, which requires some of the more garbled bits of dialogue to be subtitled, tech contributions are solid. Original tune "(I'd Have It All) If I Had Drew," written and performed by Tony DeSare, makes for a very sweet cherry on top.

Roger & Me  not only opened doors for a new, more raffish school of populist muckrakers but also suggested a novel approach for young directors seeking distribution. Stalk a celebrityin Michael Moore 's case, GM exec Roger Smith and presto: You're a celebrity yourself. In My Date With Drew , aspiring filmmaker Brian Herzlinger  assigns himself one month to snag a date with lifelong crush Drew Barrymore . (Circuit City 's return policy expires after 30 days, and he plans to give the camera back.) Never mind that telling people you want a date with Drew for your movie is not  the same as asking Drew for a date; Herzlinger's mugging is intermittently charming anyway, in part because his shit-eating grin and blind optimism would complement Barrymore's endearing naïvete. "I'm scared to death that I'm gonna look like an idiot," he tells his friends. (Too late.) Herzlinger visits Charlie's Angels  scribe John August , an L.A. facialist to the stars, and Barrymore's clueless first cousin. He has difficulty booking Andy Dick , but oddly, no trouble securing an evening with Drew's ex-flame Corey Feldman . When our hero finally does get his moment in the sunc'mon, would someone have bought the movie if he didn't?My Date With Drew  offers the surreal spectacle of pursuer and pursued pleasantly gabbing, obliviously immersed in a mutual PR stunt. It's only a matter of time before we see My Skirmish With Scarlett , My Cuddle With Keira  , and My Lap Dance With Lindsay .
