When does an era qualify for nostalgia? Jonathan Levine's The Wackness  is a studiously offbeat coming-of-age crowd-pleaser set in New York City during the long-ago, far-away days of...the summer of 1994. The film is dotted with timely signifiers (Forrest Gump  ads on a bus, lots of jabber about Giuliani), but its one truly relevant reference point is that this was the last moment in the culture before cell phones. Since The Wackness  tells the story of a teen drug dealer, pagers and pay phones are part of his arsenal.
Luke Shapiro is a geek with a swagger on the Upper East Side of Manhattan who sells bags of pot out of a fake Italian-ices cart. He's played by Josh Peck, a swarthy, insinuating actor whose knitted brows and scratchy-voiced, mocking manner are reminiscent of Bruno Kirby and David Krumholtz. The Wackness  skates over the particulars of Luke's drug operation, because the teen-pot-salesman premise is little more than that  a premise. There's a far more sentimental and, yes, quirky teen romance nestled within this tale of a dude who peddles the chronic as innocently as a paperboy. &#39;&#39;Olivia Thirlby &#39;&#39; , as Luke's crush, is as sultry-fresh as she was nerdishly genuine in &#39;&#39;Snow Angels  &#39;&#39; , but the love story, which doesn't go anywhere new, seems an afterthought by the time Luke buddies up with his shrink, an ornery, long-haired pothead played by Ben Kingsley   with a ''New York'' accent somewhere between Brooklynese and Hungarian. Since the shrink is never a credible human being, The Wackness  feels a little half-baked (no pun intended). The best thing about it is Peck, who shows you the sweet, virginal kid hiding inside the outlaw poseur.

 Correction Appended  For Luke Shapiro (Josh Peck) the summer of 1994 is a notably eventful time. In retrospect he will no doubt see it as the season when his life, as they say in the movies, changed forever. The movie  he is in, “The Wackness,” written and directed by Jonathan Levine, makes a good-faith effort to steer clear of such clichés, and succeeds and fails in roughly equal measure.  To attempt a story like this — about a young man’s sexual initiation, heartbreak and disillusionment with the adult world that he is about to enter — is to sacrifice a degree of novelty. Mr. Levine tries to compensate with a combination of historical authenticity and low-key emotional sincerity.  In the months between the end of high school and the start of college, a lot certainly happens to Luke, a shy, slack-jawed Upper East Sider who earns his pocket money by selling marijuana. His family is in danger of being evicted from its apartment. He spends a night in jail. The main thing, though, is that Luke falls in love with Stephanie (Olivia Thirlby), whose stepfather, Dr. Squires (Ben Kingsley), is both Luke’s psychiatrist and one of his clients. (It’s a barter arrangement, one kind of therapy exchanged for another.)  Stephanie is a popular girl, and Luke is a social misfit, but the main difference between them may be temperamental. She is a relatively optimistic, hedonistic soul, whereas he is a brooder and a worrier for whom the bong is always half empty. Or, as Stephanie puts it in a bit of dialogue that gives the film its title: “I look at the dopeness. You look at the wackness.”  “The Wackness” has its share of both. The wack side is exemplified by Luke and Stephanie’s self-conscious use of mid-’90s hip-hop slang, a verbal tic matched by a few too many fetishistic period details. Did I mention that the movie takes place in 1994? If that all-important fact slips your mind, Mr. Levine will supply plenty of reminders, from the shell-toed Adidas sneakers on Luke’s feet to the dropped names of Kurt Cobain, Notorious B.I.G., Forrest Gump and Rudolph W. Giuliani. Those were the days, right? No doubt. But the fussed-over precision of the historical moment feels more like a gimmick than a source of insight, much as the dreamy haze cast over Manhattan by Petra Korner’s cinematography looks like a ready-made, one-size-fits-all cloak of nostalgia.  But don’t think I’m forgetting the dopeness, which resides mainly in the idiosyncrasy of the characters and the skill of the actors portraying them. Lately Mr. Kingsley has been so busy as to seem indiscriminate, taking oddball roles in movies big and small, decent and dreadful — “BloodRayne”? “The Love Guru”? Sir Ben, really!  Even in the lamest vehicle, however, he is almost always a delight to watch. Dr. Squires, by turns squirrelly reckless, with a less than firm grip on his marriage (to a dazed and tragic Famke Janssen), reality and the will to live, is perhaps the most preposterous character in “The Wackness,” and for just that reason the most intriguingly plausible. The doctor is, for his young patient and pot supplier, both a mentor and mascot. His evident untrustworthiness makes him the only grown-up in whom Luke has any faith.  As gossip-minded readers may already know, Mr. Kingsley makes out with Mary-Kate Olsen, who in 1994, at the age of 8, was nearing the end of her run in “Full House.”  Her character here, a stoner named Union, is part of a supporting cast of eccentrics and urban curiosities — Method Man and Jane Adams are two more — who pleasantly divert “The Wackness” from its main narrative purpose.  Not that the tentative, transient romance between Luke and Stephanie is without interest. Mr. Levine is careful not to overstate the melodrama of young love, allowing Luke’s own longing and confusion to set the tone. Mr. Peck, formerly a star of the Nickelodeon tweener sitcom “Drake and Josh,” works a little too hard to convey the tension between Luke’s outward affectlessness and the riot of feeling inside. He shows great seriousness and potential as an actor, but he also shows too much of what he has learned in acting class.  Ms. Thirlby, meanwhile, who had a few nice scenes in “Juno,” does a fine job, as she did in “Snow Angels,” of playing the smart adolescent seductress of a teenage loner. I hope the angst mongers of the independent film world can find a leading role that will test her talents and show the full extent of her dopeness.  “The Wackness” is rated R (Under 17 requires parent or adult guardian). Back in the ’90s New York teenagers swore, had sex and smoked pot. Thank goodness that’s all over.

The Amerindie annals are over-full of withdrawn male loners hoping to quirk or cathart themselves out of teenage purgatory. But like "Donnie Darko," "Thumbsucker" and a few others, "The Wackness" treads this familiar terrain with assurance and distinction. Director-scenarist Jonathan Levine's first feature, the mannered slasher opus "All the Boys Love Mandy Lane," attracted inexplicable buy-buzz at the 2006 Toronto fest yet still hasn't opened theatrically. His second effort reps a considerable leap forward and should have far less trouble getting seen. Marketing toward viewers who came of age in the mid-'90s would help it avoid the classic Sundance hit/arthouse dud scenario; ancillary prospects are bright.
At first glance, it doesn't look like it's going to be much fun being around Luke Shapiro, who's graduating high school in 1994 NYC. He flaunts that era's annoying "wigger" speech--"I'm mad depressed, yo," he tells his shrink. Socially isolated and without a girlfriend, he deals marijuana out of an ice cream cart in Manhattan and for a brief while seems like an insipid hiphop-worshipping white juvenile's fantasy of how dope it would be to be, like, sorta-kinda gangsta.
But for all the vintage hiphop tracks well-utilized here, "The Wackness" isn't an exercise in wannabe outcast (or is that Outkast?) coolness. Luke's problems are echoed and amplified by everyone around him. His parents (Talia Balsam, David Wohl) are constantly at each others' throats, mostly over money matters that might get them all evicted from their Upper East Side apartment.
Aforementioned shrink Dr. Squires (Ben Kingsley) is also a client of Luke's--paid in green bud, not greenbacks--who offers highly dubious advice, perhaps wanting to live out a vicarious second-chance horny youth through his patient. His own love life with trophy wife Kristin (Famke Janssen) has turned freezing cold. While highly medicated himself, he tells the lad, "You don't need medication, you need to get laid." This aged rock 'n' roll Lothario turns hypocritically disapproving, however, when Luke reveals the one girl he's really stuck on is his classmate Stephanie (Olivia Thirlby), Doc's own worldly, popular stepdaughter.
All her friends away for the summer, a hitherto standoffish Stephanie suddenly exhibits very friendly interest in Luke. When Doc and wife try to make up via a Barbados getaway, the younger couple repair to the elders' empty Fire Island cottage. Luke's inexperience is amusingly and credibly depicted as classic Bad Firsttime Sex...though he proves a fast learner.
These twin sojourns surpass everyone's expectations, yet their aftermath is sobering. "The Wackness" continues through a final act whose requisite growing-up-means-painful-lessons content is adroitly handled in a mix of outrageous behavior and melancholy resignation. In the end, pic's central relationship isn't between the young leads, but between Luke and the psychiatrist several times his senior--unlikely friends who both have some maturing to do, and prove oddly adept at nudging each other in that direction.
Kingsley has a ball with Squires' gonzo character, getting a bizarre makeout session with none other than Mary-Kate Olsen as a barely-legal Central Park hippie chick. Jane Adams also makes an impression as another pot buyer who clicks with the doctor. Janssen doesn't get a lot to do, but Thirlby is appealing as a girl both precociously assured and uncertain what she wants. While Peck somewhat oversells the open-mouthed, glaze-eyed stoner act, he's nonetheless a most appealing protagonist.
Design contribs are very well turned, with Petra Korner's desaturated widescreen lensing, Josh Noyes' diverse editorial approaches, David Torn's ethereal original score and other contribs conveying the characters' emotional precariousness during a Manhattan heatwave summer.

 


The Wackness  is a mix tape of clichés, with writer-director Jonathan Levine  taking cuts from a dozen or more "life-affirming" coming-of-age melodramas and setting them to the backbeat of NYC '94. The movie begins by ballyhooing its "edge": The Sony Classics logo gets tagged over; teenage hip-hop head Luke  (Josh Peck ) is introduced stonewalling his psychiatrist, Dr. Squires (Ben Kingsley )—then, before the session wraps, the patient pays his shrink off in . . . kind bud! Ohhhhhhhh, schnaps (insert DJ scratching noise)—this ain't ya parents' Ordinary People , son! Dealer Luke's first summer post–high school finds him socially stalled by weed paranoia, wondering if his lingering virginity will be permanent. As his old man is the most castrated patriarch since Jim Backus  strapped on an apron, midlife satyr Doc S. becomes the substitute father figure, paraphrasing Harold and Maude  platitudes about LIFE! in a wobbly accent. This, combined with notably fugly cinematography, should equate to so much Sundance offal, but Peck keeps the production shy of execrable. He's real like nothing else here: a big, pear-shaped UES Jewish kid unsuccessfully masking his insecurities—he keeps his shirt on when swimming and screwing— with street posturing and headphone-clogged self-absorption. All the drug-slinging material's counterfeit, but the script is refreshingly straight-faced in looking at the strange relationship between white boys and rap.
