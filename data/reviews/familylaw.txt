Can one make an arresting movie about a completely happy man? Ariel (Daniel Hendler), an unassuming law professor in Buenos Aires, is married to a gorgeous Pilates instructor (Julieta Díaz) and dotes on his tyke of a son. Where's the drama? Well, Ariel's own father (Arturo Goetz), a colorful, if unscrupulous, lawyer, wishes Ariel would follow more closely in his footsteps. That's it! That's the entire film! Family Law  is well acted, but if Antoine Doinel had been nearly this serene, Truffaut's career would have petered out after three films.

 Like father like son: exploratory variations on that old saw are the thematic heart of the Argentine filmmaker Daniel Burman’s  “Family Law.” The third installment of his semiautobiographical trilogy of films about fatherhood, which began six years ago with “Waiting for the Messiah” and continued with “Lost Embrace” in 2004, this delicate, bittersweet comedy prepares you for an eruption of high drama that never arrives.  That withholding of catharsis is deliberate. In a printed interview that accompanies the film’s production notes, Mr. Burman comes forth as an outspoken champion of understatement. The signals conveyed by body language and silence, he maintains, are truer than the words that come out of people’s mouths. And this likable, if undramatic film  — the antithesis of Hollywood movies in which father-son Oedipal conflicts are resolved in embarrassing, teary-eyed clinches  — makes a case for reticence.  Bernardo and Ariel Perelman, the father and son under the movie’s microscope, are both lawyers of Polish-Jewish extraction living in Buenos Aires. Bernardo (Arturo Goetz), a widower in his mid-60s, is a successful lawyer who follows a strict daily routine that  the 30-something  Ariel (Daniel Hendler) describes in detail in an introductory voice-over.  Ariel, rather than join his father’s business, teaches law. And in the film’s classroom scenes, the younger Perelman (both men are called by their last names) comes across as a talented underachiever adrift in a postgraduate limbo.  As the story unfolds, Ariel goes through several  life passages, including his marriage to Sandra (Julieta Díaz), a law student who teaches Pilates, and fatherhood. But neither the wedding nor the birth of their child, Gastón (Eloy Burman, the  director’s son) is shown. True to his aesthetic,  Mr. Burman looks for the truth of his characters in the texture of their daily lives. That Ariel often goes to bed wearing his suit, for instance, looms as a significant detail.  The movie is a casual detective story in which Ariel, observing Bernardo from afar, speculates about his father’s mysterious ways. Is Bernardo’s longtime secretary, Norita (Adriana Aizenberg), his lover? All the signs suggest that she is, although Ariel would never inquire.  “Family Law” is also the portrait of a marriage that involves an unusual amount of secrecy. Ariel selects Sandra as his future wife long before she is aware of him as a potential suitor. To get to know her better, he signs up for personal Pilates instruction. He wins her love after she is sued for practicing Pilates without a license and he volunteers his legal advice.  Unbeknownst to Sandra, Ariel consults his father, who bends the law in her favor; Ariel allows her to think he did it himself. Late in the movie, when he confesses his deception, she barely registers a reaction. When a construction accident at the law school where he teaches forces him to take sabbatical while repairs are made, he doesn’t tell his wife that he is spending his days idle.  This reflexive secrecy mirrors his distance from Bernardo. When Bernardo turns 65, Ariel forgets it is his birthday. And when Bernardo unexpectedly reaches out to Ariel and insists on showing him around the office, the son doesn’t realize that a serious, hidden agenda lies behind the gesture.  The film’s most touching moments find Ariel bonding with his  2½-year-old-son while Sandra goes on a Pilates retreat. In the scenes of this adorable, happy little boy reaching out to his father, you can feel a bond of trust and devotion deepening into a lifelong attachment. That attachment, if it follows the family tradition, may leave much unspoken. Thirty years hence, Ariel may be a mystery to Gastón as Bernardo is to Ariel. But Gastón will know that he is loved, and that’s what matters.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

A deft, witty and emotionally rewarding study of a thirtysomething man in his roles as father and son, Daniel Burman's intensely personal "Family Law" completes his fatherhood trilogy. The second installment, "Lost Embrace," won the Silver Bear at Berlin in 2004. Again featuring an outstanding Daniel Hendler (best actor in 2004) and a script that fuses sharp observation with the intimacy of a lightly rewritten autobiography, pic effortlessly takes the viewer through a range of thoughts and moods. Fans of "Embrace" might lament the relative absence of social context this time, but pic's multiple merits should consolidate helmer's burgeoning offshore reputation.
A lengthy voiceover by lawyer-teacher Perelman (Hendler) describes the daily routine of his widowed lawyer father Perelman Sr. (Arturo Goetz). A portrait emerges of the father as a tough role model to follow. Norita (Adriana Aizanberg) is Perelman's faithful secretary, the only person with whom he is himself.
Son Perelman's classes are slightly chaotic affairs in which he works out his personal doubts in public. One of his students is pilates teacher Sandra (Julieta Diaz), whom the lecturer has decided he will marry. He starts taking pilates from her, but his big chance comes when she runs into a legal problem. Perelman wins the case, but doesn't tell Sandra that he was dependent on his father's advice.
When we next see Perelman and Sandra, they are married with a 2-year-old son, Gaston (Eloy Burman). Following a charmingly awkward sequence where he forgets his father's 65th birthday, pic focuses on Perelman's relations with his dad, who continually seems to be dropping hints to him that he fails to pick up. After Sandra heads off on a pilates retreat, the younger, and frightened, Perelman is left alone to look after Gaston.
There is nothing here that a thousand Jewish family comedy dramas haven't done before, but the difference is in the insistently understated treatment. As in "Embrace," the script works largely by omission and ellipsis, with the defining moments in Perelman's life -- including his wedding and the birth of Gaston -- not shown onscreen.
This principle extends into the dialogue: This is very much a pic about people not talking to one another and discovering the truth only when it's too late. Perfs are likewise heavy with meaningful facial expressions communicating never fully articulated thoughts: One long shot on protag's face toward the end speaks volumes.
To all intents and purposes, Hendler plays Perelman Jr. as "Embrace's" Ariel a few years down the line: a blank-faced, over controlled and selfish victim of circumstances. We never learn his first name -- even his wife and father, call him Perelman.
Other perfs are similarly trenchant, with Goetz as the gently-smiling father figure finding all the nuances in a potentially restrictive role. The boy Gaston is helmer Burman's real-life son, presumably playing his extremely cute self.
Dialogue's wit often sounds like overheard conversation.Treatment is fly-on-the-wall throughout, though lensing is happily less reliant on hand-held than it was in "Embrace." The delicate, piano-based score is similarly used discreetly to underline mood. Pic is thick with the flavors of Buenos Aires street life.

Unlike his intensely committed and colorful lawyer father, Ariel Perelman  (a deadpan Daniel Hendler ) is anal, inexpressive, becalmed in a dull job, and unsure of his place in life. Forced to loosen up a little when he snags a lively, beautiful wife he thought was out of his league and becomes a parent, Ariel is further unsettled when his father comes to him with a proposition. On paper, Family Law  follows the familiar arc of domestic trouble and redemption. Onscreen, it's a visually puckish, tragicomic celebration of an unassuming man's unsung goodness, which broadens, like Argentine filmmaker Daniel Burman's other movies, into a meditation on secular-Jewish identity in a less-than-tolerant society. Like his equally father-fixated, and equally wonderful, 2003 film Lost Embrace , Burman's beguiling tribute to his Jewish fatheror, for all I know, the one he wishes he hadis warm and deep enough to give humanism a good name.
