In Stephanie Daley , a 16-year-old Christian girl, played with exploratory shy grace by Amber Tamblyn, is accused of murdering her newborn infant. But did she even know that she was pregnant? That's what Tilda Swinton, as a forensic psychologist who is about to have a baby herself, must determine. Shot in a  pinpoint, suggestive handheld style, this lacerating drama from writer-director Hilary Brougher shines a piercing light onto some of the hidden terrors of women, especially in an era when abstinence can shade into ignorance. The scary culminating flashback, in which Stephanie gives birth  in a public restroom, on a high school ski trip  is a marvel of authentic disturbance.

 The Ski Mom Case: that’s the callous label the news media affix to the prosecution of the title character of “Stephanie Daley” for the murder of her newborn on a class ski trip. Stephanie (Amber Tamblyn), a shy, guarded 16-year-old who is the only child of conservative religious parents, denies responsibility by insisting that she didn’t know she was pregnant. Her condition is discovered when she collapses while traipsing through the snow with her friends.  The film keeps us in suspense about what actually happened, and it isn’t until the end that the sad facts are revealed, in a grisly, agonized scene in a toilet stall. As the movie fills in Stephanie’s story in flashbacks, the narrative revolves around her gently persistent interrogation by Lydie Crane (Tilda Swinton), the forensic psychologist hired by the prosecution to draw her out. Lydie, who gave birth to a stillborn child and is now in the final weeks of another pregnancy, is Stephanie’s ethical foil in a morally ambiguous game of cat and mouse.  At moments the parallels between the two women’s lives seem a little too programmatic for comfort. There is a fine line between a human drama with its own life and an issue-oriented dramatic essay. And if “Stephanie Daley,” written and directed by Hilary Brougher, didn’t have its ear so perfectly tuned to intergenerational dialogue, and to the severe language of sex education in schools where abstinence is taught as the only acceptable form of birth control, it would come across as just such an essay.  But almost until the end, when it makes a confusing, melodramatic misstep, the movie feels extraordinarily lifelike. The scenes set in Stephanie’s English class, in which “The Scarlet Letter” is being taught, reveal exactly how a classic work of literature can be bent to express a particular agenda.  When the teacher asks the class to describe the point of this Hawthorne novel, Stephanie pipes up, “It’s harder to live a lie than to tell the truth and be punished.” But the class rebel, Satin (Caitlin Van Zandt), a plain, stout girl and lapsed Christian with a bad reputation, dismisses the book. Satin’s bravado collapses when the teacher approaches her desk, glares down at her and declares: “You know what great literature is about, Satin? It’s about man and God. Nothing else really matters.” Afterward Satin tearfully accuses Stephanie of being a sheep.  The equally incisive scene of Stephanie’s sly seduction by an older boy during a beer party at which she is too shy to socialize offers a creepy picture of sexual exploitation posing as kindness. The movie also shows the devastating effects on Stephanie’s parents of the publicity surrounding the case.  As the movie compares Stephanie’s sullen evasiveness and her impulse to protect her privacy to the underlying ambivalence of Lydie, who professes to be thrilled by her pregnancy while suspecting her distant architect husband, Paul (Timothy Hutton), of infidelity, the teenager and the psychologist are sisters under the skin. On matters of childbirth Paul is as hard-nosed in his way as the officials at Stephanie’s school. His disgust with Lydie after her failure to memorialize the baby she miscarried has seriously eroded their marriage.  Keenly intelligent, sensitive and self-protective, Ms. Swinton’s Lydie is as fully realized as Ms. Tamblyn’s Stephanie. If one weren’t grilling the other, you could imagine them as mentor and protégée. Without standing on a soapbox “Stephanie Daley” suggests a tragic gender gap between men who judge and women who feel.  “Stephanie Daley” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes sexual situations and an agonizing birth scene.

A ripped-from-the-headlines premise -- a teenage mother accused of killing her newborn -- provides the catalyst for a taut, provocative, sometimes overreaching but always absorbing thriller in "Stephanie Daley," the highly accomplished sophomore feature from writer-director Hilary Brougher. Built around knockout lead performances by Tilda Swinton and erstwhile "Joan of Arcadia" star Amber Tamblyn, pic brushes up against hot-button issues from teen pregnancy and sex ed to the separation of church and state, without turning into an "issues" picture. But overriding bleak tone and absence of easy answers suggest a commercial forecast as forbidding as the pic's snowbound upstate New York setting.
In a gripping opening, 16-year-old Stephanie (Tamblyn) tracks through the snow during a high school ski club retreat, leaving a trail of blood. She collapses and is rushed to the hospital, where it is discovered she has just given birth. Claiming she didn't know she was pregnant and that the baby was stillborn, Stephanie is nonetheless brought up on murder charges when the physical evidence reveals the baby (discovered in a toilet) had water in its lungs and toilet paper stuffed down its throat.
Five months later, on the verge of a trial, Stephanie is scheduled for examination by forensic psychologist Lydie Crane (Swinton), who recently endured a stillbirth herself and is pregnant again. A series of sessions between therapist and patient follows, during which Stephanie's past -- or, at least, her version of it -- unfolds in flashback.
But if the basic premise of "Stephanie Daley" seems more conventional than that of Brougher's debut feature, the 1997 nuclear paranoia/time travel drama "The Sticky Fingers of Time," the variety of tones she creates and sustains over the course of this beguiling work, from woman's social melodrama to Cronenbergian horror, is no less impressive.
The flashbacks, which show Stephanie's high-school life and the party at which she loses her virginity, recall "The Last Picture Show" in their awkward adolescent sexuality. The scenes between Stephanie and her parents are uncommonly truthful in their feel for that teenage tug-of-war between freedom and supervision. And the ultimate depiction of Stephanie's bathroom-stall labor is as unnerving a cinematic set piece as anything this side of a Michael Haneke movie -- all the more so for Brougher's refusal to tell us how we should feel toward Stephanie.
"Stephanie Daley" is also very much Lydie's story, and the film is at its strongest when it concentrates on the odd tension that develops between this mature woman who has strived so desperately to have a baby and this naive young adult who has, seemingly without care, tossed one away. Despite her composed exterior, Lydie's own life seems headed toward crisis: Her architect husband (an excellent Timothy Hutton) may be having an affair, while her interactions with Stephanie dredge up unresolved feelings about her own dead child.
Brougher never allows the pic to devolve into a simplistic pro-choice versus pro-life debate, or for Stephanie and Lydie to move toward some teary-eyed common ground. Rather, she keeps her focus on the myriad physical, emotional and psychological ramifications of bringing a child into the world.
However, at the close of the pic's brisk 91-minute running time, other potentially intriguing ideas raised by the film -- notably, a recurring discussion about religious faith and Stephanie's contention that her pregnancy may have been a punishment from God -- remain only superficially explored.
Brougher has developed a more confident visual style in the decade since "Sticky Fingers," executing scenes with a cool, at times almost clinical precision and drawing extraordinary work from her actors. Like her characters in "The Deep End" and "Thumbsucker," this role affords Swinton a welcome opportunity to play against the kind of otherworldly exotic in which she's been frequently typecast, and also to appear more fragile and vulnerable onscreen than she has ever allowed herself.
Tamblyn, meanwhile, is a quiet revelation in a role that is like a high-wire act performed over the chasm between childhood innocence and adult responsibility.
Tech credits are modest, but solid, with David Morrison's HD-to-35mm lensing segueing nicely from muted grays and browns in present day scenes to warm, saturated hues in the flashbacks. Minimalist musical score by David Mansfield ("Heaven's Gate," "Transamerica") is also a plus.
 Camera (Deluxe color, HD-to-35mm), David Morrison; editor, Keith Reamer; music, David Mansfield; music supervisor, Liz Regan; production designer, Sharon Lomofsky; costume designer, Kurt and Bart; sound (Dolby Digital), Judy Karp; sound designer, Tom Paul; casting, Nicole Arbusto, Joy Dickson.

At a high-school party, Stephanie Daley  (Amber Tamblyn ) marches straight into the requisite rape room and walks out pregnant. Back at her district's parochially slanted blackboard jungle, she is relentlessly reminded of the bulge she's trying to ignore: The health teacher preaches abstinence and asks everyone to nurse beeper eggs while The Scarlet Letter is all the rage in English class. Writer-director Hilary Brougher knows how to rub it in, but Tamblyn is fearless in her attempt to save the narrative from falling into clichéd sermonizing. When Stephanie's baby ends up dead in a toilet bowl, Tilda Swinton  enters as Lydia, the forensic psychologist hired to learn who knew what when. There's an unpretentious complexity to Brougher's paralleling of Stephanie and Lydia's private lives, and though the story is littered with contrivance, the actresses keep things recognizably human, advancing a rather affecting message about shared female experience that advocates both empathy and accountability.
