The cops on Comedy Central's shameless, improv-based "Reno 911!" are certainly stupid in their local jurisdiction. But "Reno 911!: Miami" confirms that they'd be unsafe in any city -- and funny, too. The film is just a series of sketches crudely stapled, at the last minute, to a plot. But the outlandishness is still as amusing as it is on TV.
"Miami" brings to Florida the eight dim officers of the show's Reno sheriff's department, an unflappable troupe of whites, blacks, gays, and a Hispanic. The occasion is a national law enforcement convention, and they're barely in town a day when the city's 2,000 police officers are quarantined in an absurd bio terrorism episode, leaving it to the Reno gang to patrol the streets, coloring every distress call with their own situational incompetence.
A documentary film crew is on hand to record every gaffe -- the beached whale they blow up, the gator-bit corpse they leave in a swimming pool. But really, like the more conceptually audacious "Borat," the format is a conceit that justifies the movie's visual limitations. It also allows "Reno" the movie (like the TV show) to send up the action on "Cops."
The crimes, both petty and major, are fine. But the funniest thing about "Miami" is the hormones raging among this octet. Officer Williams (Niecy Nash) wants Deputy Jones (Cedric Yarb rough ), who wants Officer Clementine Johnson (Wendi McLendon-Covey ), who actually wants him, too. Deputies Garcia (Carlos Alazraqui ) and Junior (Robert Ben Garant ) want whatever women will have them. And poor Lieutenant Dangle (Thomas Lennon ), in his tragic after-hours denim cutoffs (the pockets droop below the fraying hemline), can't find a man, and has to fend off the desperate advances of Officer Wiegel (Kerry Kenney-Silver), who seems too dense to care that Dangle is gay.
All this lust culminates in a nicely observed long take in which all eight try to score at their fleabag motel before bed. It's like an extremely sexually frustrated episode of "The Real World" or "Melrose Place."
The Miami beachfront offers a chance to mock Hollywood blockbusters as well as "Baywatch." Officer Williams's stupendously buxom figure, for instance, sets a new, museum-quality standard for proudly pear-shaped women. It helps to imagine that Claes Oldenburg made the pear.
What's refreshing about both the movie and the series is how the women in the cast are meaningfully in on the jokes. Kenney-Silver wrote "Miami" with Lennon and Garant, who also directed. (They were members of the old sketch-comedy outfit "The State," which was on MTV for a couple of years in the early 1990s.)
The storyline they dream up strains to redeem these cops in the eyes of their contemptuous peers. (It doesn't work .) Still, to that end, there's a plot to be foiled involving the Cuban drug lord (Paul Rudd) who has the bio terrorism antidote and on one occasion tortures a victim with a Weed Whacker.
This low-rent, nonsense cop business filled me with a nostalgic twinge. I didn't know I wanted the "Police Academy" series resurrected with a lot more hilarity, but I'm glad somebody did it.


         In "Reno 911!: Miami," all you need to know about Reno's finest (the dysfunctional sheriff's department from the cult Comedy Central TV show) is summed up early on when a call comes in for an "814"—"armed person on the roof." Or, as it turns out, a chicken on the road, which leads Lt. Jim Dangle (Thomas Lennon) and company to nearly maim one another as they attempt to apprehend said poultry.
 
  From there, series regulars and co-writers Lennon, Robert Ben Garant (who also directs) and Kerri Kenney-Silver transplant their dumbed-down takeoff on "Cops" to South Beach for the American Police Convention. Then, after an infectious contamination places the entire Miami police force under quarantine, the ragtag Reno gang is left as "the only thing standing between chaos and order."
 


         






    Of course, chaos ensues, and the overwhelmed and under-witted officers find themselves up against the likes of a pseudo drug lord (Paul Rudd), a sperm whale corpse rotting on a topless beach and even Terry the gay prostitute (Nick Swardson), a show regular whose lispy verbiage is fraught with insults and sexual innuendo.
 
  Often mildly amusing but rarely laugh-out-loud funny, the film works best in scenes with a distinct Miami flavor. Hot pants-clad Lennon with his Reno drawl and fair skin stand out in more ways than one when he and Garant (Deputy Travis Junior) answer a noise complaint call at the residence of one Suge Knight. And in by far the film's best scene, Cedric Yarbrough (Deputy S. Jones) and Carlos Alazraqui (Deputy James Garcia) stand by terrified and dumbfounded as a beer-guzzling and -bellied local yokel (Chris Tallman) leaps into a turbid swimming pool with an alligator.
 
  Other funny bits include a fast cameo by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson as a butterfingered, grenade-toting super cop, and in a more complex scene at a seedy motel, the camera follows the inebriated and amorous officers as they move from room to room, interrupting their colleagues in various states of arousal.
 
  While the film offers a definite step up in production values from its TV counterpart, big screen-worthy scenes are few and far between. And aside from uncensored profanity and unpixelated nudity, the "Reno 911!: Miami" never really stretches its legs, and instead often feels more like a stretched-out half-hour episode.
 
  "Reno 911!: Miami." MPAA rating: R for sexual content, nudity, crude humor, language and drug use. Running time: 1 hour, 24 minutes. In general release.   

 In my neck of the woods, a subscription to basic cable costs $50 a month. For that price you receive the usual network staples and standard cable offerings like “Top Chef” and Comedy Central’s raucously silly “Reno 911!,” which pops up two, sometimes three times a day in repeats and new episodes. At that rate, each episode of “Reno 911!” costs a little more than a buck, which seems a much better deal than whatever your local movie theater plans on charging for the slapdash, on-and-off funny and exceedingly lazy feature-length (barely) version of the show, “Reno 911!: Miami.”  As on the show, the film offers eight comic actors of varying improvisational talents and interest playing Reno, Nev., sheriff’s department officers with no discernible abilities. First among players is Lt. Jim Dangle, the pint-size peacock played by Thomas Lennon, one of the film’s three writers. With his mustache, muscles and short shorts, Lieutenant Dangle looks like a Tom of Finland miniature, something to put on the shelf next to the Village People action figures. Mr. Lennon squeezes a lot of mileage out of his outfit, but he also has slyly effective timing, which he puts to good use in his scenes with the two other writers: Robert Ben Garant, who also directed the film and plays Deputy Travis Junior, and Kerri Kenney-Silver, who plays Deputy Trudy Wiegel.  The film’s title more or less says all you need to know about the story, the action and the point: “Reno 911!” plus Miami. Lured by the prospect of a police convention and all the hilarity those gatherings promise, the officers hit Miami and its unsuspecting population. Confusion ensues, as do slapstick, shtick, stereotypes, wisecracks, misunderstandings, fat jokes, gay jokes, masturbation jokes, yet more masturbation jokes, some unfortunate sex and a few dead bodies. Dwayne Johnson puts in a genial cameo as a macho man to die for, and Paul Rudd shows up doing a lousy (presumably intentionally so) riff on Al Pacino as Tony Montana, wielding a weed-whacker instead of a chain saw. A dead whale and an enormous prosthetic buttocks round out the laughs.  It’s funny what different contexts can do. On television, where it’s broken into small chunks and interrupted by blocks of commercials, “Reno 911!” can make for a diverting pastime. When blown up for the movies, however, the same jokes don’t carry anywhere near the same zing. The commercials serve an important rhythmic function, since they impose time constraints on how long each comic bit lasts: funny bit, commercial, funny bit, commercial. The self-consciously threadbare story lines — in one episode, a deputy tries to marry while the others guard Liberace’s piano — work well with the piecemeal comedy. Yet what feels amusingly anarchic on the small screen feels underdeveloped and disjointed on the big screen, perhaps because instead of commercials gluing the jokes together there’s dead air.  “Reno 911!: Miami” runs 84 minutes, or about as long as four back-to-back episodes without the ads. And indeed 10 of those minutes seem gobbled up by the bloated closing credits, which include comic odds and ends along with the usual data. Mr. Lennon and Mr. Garant are funny guys; they’re also awfully busy, having written a handful of recent titles, including the hit “Night at the Museum” and the forthcoming comedy “Balls of Fury.” “Reno 911!: Miami” provokes some chuckles and minor hoots, but it’s a disappointingly sloppy affair that feels as if it had been thrown together with little more than spit and a belief in the enduring good will of the show’s fans, some of whom might actually be hoping for a movie.  “Reno 911!: Miami” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes vulgar language and some partial nudity.

Fox has reaped nifty little paydays from risque comedies, but the minimal effort expended on this barely-feature-length version of Comedy Central's "Reno 911!" exposes the exercise for what it is -- namely, an opening-weekend pit stop en route to the inevitable unrated DVD release, which will likely do reasonably well. Running a mere 80 minutes and somehow still feeling heavily padded, this "Cops" spoof yields a few amusing (if widely spaced) moments but otherwise simply revels in the gratuitous nudity, language and below-the-belt gags that an "R" rating provides.
With the series in its fifth season -- chronicling in deadpan, mock cinema verite-style the crime-fighting efforts of Reno's police force -- the producers obviously felt the movie needed a splashier stage, even if the biggest little city in the world is amusingly described near the outset as "like Mayberry, except everyone's on crystal meth and prostitution's legal."
So writer-stars Robert Ben Garant (who also directed), Thomas Lennon and Kerri Kenney-Silver came up with the flimsy excuse of shipping Reno's eight sheriffs to a police convention in Miami, only to have a crisis leave them the only cops available to patrol the streets.
Following a setup that showcases the group partying in Florida -- which includes not only a mass-masturbation scene, but a depth charge consisting of tequila and Pepto-Bismol -- the movie then devolves into an extra-long episode of the TV program. Capitalizing on the venue, the cops encounter an alligator in a swimming pool (funny), trouble at a topless beach (obvious) and a weed whacker-wielding mobster (Paul Rudd, in one of many celebrities making cameos, among them producer Danny DeVito) that parodies the Al Pacino version of "Scarface."
That virtually all the jokes prove sophomoric is to be expected, whether they dwell on the sexuality of Lt. Jim Dangle (Lennon), he of the skin-tight shorts; the ample bosom of Deputy Clementine (Wendi McLendon-Covey), sporting a mysterious tattoo; or Deputy Trudy (Kenney-Silver), pining for Dangle and seeking to learn how to be hip from Deputy Raineesha (Niecy Nash), who patrols the local beaches in a thong.
Like any improvised comedy, though, there's a rarely-hit-and-mostly-miss element to the goings-on. It's telling that the obligatory closing-credit sequence displaying additional footage (not outtakes) isn't any better, suggesting there was hardly a glut of laugh-out-loud gems left on the cutting-room floor.
All of which goes to demonstrate that while it's easy enough to slap a colon on a lowbrow cable TV show, additional punctuation by itself isn't sufficient to actually transform it into a movie.


Norbit has nothing on Niecy Nash , who proudly parades her prosthetic ass along Miami Beach , lowering oceanside property values with each thunderous step. The joke here is that the snooty pastel metropolis needs to be taken down a few rungs by Nash and her law-enforcement crew from the Comedy Central  show Reno 911  (basically a lampoon of Cops , only dumber, if that's possible). The series regularsincluding director Robert Ben Garant , Thomas Lennon , and Kerri Kenney-Silver accomplish this task with signature incompetence. With the city's regular police force trapped inside a quarantined convention, our gang from Reno  confronts backyard gators, a bad Scarface  imitator (Paul Rudd ), and even Dwayne "the Rock" Johnson in a good-natured cameo. The TV show excels with its short squad-car bursts of random inanity; here, the plotstretched out to 84 minutesfeels like a dime bag tossed aside by a fleeing perp.
