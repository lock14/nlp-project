You think you know the story of the genteel lady who finds sexual bliss with a rough gamekeeper. But you do not  not like in Lady Chatterley , Pascale Ferran's startling, womanly adaptation of a lesser-known, more direct version of D.H. Lawrence's famous novel, one of three he wrote. There's an adult life force in every frame of this luxuriously paced work, even in the sight of rain and a lady's stocking. And there's emotional as well as physical nakedness in the performances of Marina Hands and Jean-Louis Coulloc'h as lovers who talk through touch.


 Far too many literary adaptations wear the fancy dress of high culture prestige or bind themselves into corsets of reverence. Pascale Ferran’s “Lady Chatterley” is different, and not just because it is a costume drama whose main characters frequently appear unclothed. It is hardly a canonical or faithful rendering of D. H. Lawrence’s once-scandalous novel —  Ms. Ferran based her film on an earlier, less notorious version of the book and made Lawrence’s earthy English lovers profess their amours en français — but who needs that anyway? This “Lady Chatterley,” winner of five César awards in France, feels bracingly fresh, vital and modern.  It is easy to forget just how modern Lawrence was, and remains. Even books that were daring in their day have a way of becoming respectable with the passage of time, as they are folded into the educational curriculum and the other machinery of middlebrow culture. Ms. Ferran restores Lawrence to the present partly by placing his themes in the service of her own sensibility.  A learned friend of mine, after seeing the film, remarked that it was not very Lawrentian, an objection that is not so much inaccurate as irrelevant. Lawrence’s quasimystical notions about sex and nature have been revised and to some degree refined. His eros of dirt and sweat and animal impulses — less pronounced in the version Ms. Ferran chose than in its better-known successor — are replaced by the sensuality of sunshine, wildflowers and fresh air.  Which is not to suggest that there is anything soft or overly pretty about “Lady Chatterley,” which is candid, unsentimental and, in spite of a nearly three-hour running time, remarkably brisk. It tells a disarmingly simple story. Constance Chatterley (Marina Hands) is a young wife not so much oppressed by convention as bored with her marriage and detached from her own feelings. Her husband, Clifford (Hippollyte Girardot), crippled by a war wound, has moved them to his family’s estate, Wragby (try saying it in French), where there is not much for Constance to do. Until, that is, she meets Oliver Parkin (Jean-Louis Coulloc’h), Wragby’s taciturn gamekeeper, with his taurine physique and sad boxer’s face.  Lawrence was one of the first writers to insist that sexuality was a powerful, transformative realm of experience that deserved to be considered on its own terms, outside of traditional moral and religious considerations. His three versions of “Lady Chatterley” (Ms. Ferran’s source is the second) push this view beyond what seemed, to Lawrence and several generations of British censors, to be the limits of acceptable discourse.  Of course what once seemed transgressive is by now old news. But if novels and movies about sex have lost their salutary shock value, many of Lawrence’s essential insights about human nature remain true. What Ms. Ferran shows, with exemplary clarity and subtlety, is the way sexual attraction, and the connection it creates, alter both Constance’s and Parkin’s perceptions of themselves, each other and the world around them.  This is not an easy change to convey, in part because the lovers lack words to explain what is happening to them. But the actors’ faces and bodies prove to be impressively eloquent, as is Julien Hirsch’s verdant, summery cinematography. The film’s sex scenes (there are six in all) chart the progress of desire from curiosity to intimacy and convey how sexual chemistry can turn into love.  The first time Parkin and Lady Chatterley make love, it is in haste, fully clothed, on the floor of Parkin’s cottage. Afterward the camera lingers on Ms. Hands’s face — her loveliness is more sweet than smoldering — as if pausing to interpret the enigmatic smile that plays over her features. It is a look of pleasure certainly (though not exactly of sexual rapture, given how quick and clumsy Parkin was), but also of surprise, apprehension and insight. Something unexpected has happened to Constance, and she appears intrigued by the prospect of figuring out what it was. And of doing it again.  Ms. Hands, still in the early stages of her film career, has a beguiling mixture of poise and naturalness. Her Lady Chatterley is both decorous and straightforward, a woman whose easy friendliness helps to bridge the differences of background and status between her and Parkin. Class, at least as much a preoccupation for Lawrence as sex, figures less prominently in this film than it might have. This is partly because the actors, speaking French while pretending to be English, don’t have the accents that would mark their place in the British social hierarchy.  But the contrast between Parkin and Lady Chatterley is not just a matter of privilege, and Mr. Coulloc’h and Ms. Hands complicate the stereotypes to which their characters might be vulnerable. He is timid and kind as well as rough, and she seems to be as comfortable in the woods as in her drawing room.  In stripping “Lady Chatterley” of some of its mystique, Ms. Ferran has rediscovered both the novel’s originality and the source of its durable appeal, which is not salaciousness but candor. She has made a love story that stands on its own, a film whose imaginative freedom perfectly matches the liberation experienced by its heroine.
Drawing on the most scandalous summer romance in English literature, Pascale Ferran 's Lady Chatterley   is itself a sort of vacationa leisurely immersion in a verdant, sensuous world that's largely free of the sexual pontifications intrinsic to D.H. Lawrence 's novel.
Ferran's adaptation is based on the penultimate draft of Lady Chatterley's Lover , known to Lawrence scholars as John Thomas  and Lady Jane  (after the adulterous lovers' pet names for each other's private parts), and the narrative is considerably streamlined. Didactic subplots are eliminated; more emphasis is placed on the characters' actions than their words. The movie is a tale rather than a tract. Not that Lady Chatterley , which won five Cesar awards last spring and had its local premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival , is without ideas; like the novel, it prescribes a regimen of healthy vitalism in response to the wasteland carnage of World War I or the cost of industrialization.
Perhaps because this is a French production, social class is less of an issue; the ecstatic carnal affair between young Constance Chatterley (a star-making role for slim, freckled Marina Hands ) and her husband's gamekeeper, here called Oliver Parkin  (the sensitively inexpressive Jean-Louis Coulloc'h ), is a relatively angst-free and overwhelmingly "natural" affairat once open-ended and overdetermined.
The plot is a ribald anecdote that Lawrence decided to elevate to philosophical myth. Unmanned by his war injuries, Lord Clifford Chatterley  (Hippolyte Girardot ) is a huffy, if understandable, sulk who compensates for his disability by grimly running the family mines and thus contributing to the despoliation of the countryside. His love-starved wife, meanwhile, is inexorably drawn into the woods around the Chatterley estate, where she inevitably encounters Parkina robust, if no longer young, man, the sight of whose shirtless, work-hardened back, glimpsed by chance as she gathers flowers, literally knocks her dizzy.
Whether it's because Ferran has based her movie on Lawrence's second version or because the director has her own sense of what a woman might want, Parkin is as tender and competent a lover as the Oliver Mellors  of the last Lady Chatterley , but an altogether nicer, less attitudinous fellow. (There's no equivalent here to Mellors's talk-like-a-pirate postcoital bluster: "A woman's a lovely thing when er's deep ter fuck . . . . Ah luv thee wi' ma ba's and wi' my heart.") Coulloc'h, whose flattened, craggy features suggest a discarded model of Marlon Brando , projects a resigned melancholy that adds gravitas to Hands's demurely determined pursuit.
Ferran's direction encompasses both points of view. Her camera is at once objective and avid. Her unostentatious analysis is reinforced by the curiosity in Hands's dark, watchful eyes, whether regarding herself in the mirror or studying her partner's preparations for lovemaking. The filmmaker early on provides a brisk inventory of Connie's undergarments, the better for the viewer to appreciate the practical logistics of what Lawrence calls the "sex thing." But, although the movielike the novelis structured around a half-dozen trysts, each with its own particular lesson, it never feels schematic. Ferran lavishes her close-ups mainly on the couple's hands and faces. This sensitivity is less coy than an insistence that the lady and the gamekeeper, for whom every interaction naturally leads to intercourse, are just two humans following their best, rather than basest, instincts.
The montage-based spectacle of the world joyously blossoming along with the lovers' libidos was the basis for two previous movies that provocatively glossed Lawrence's story: Czech director Gustav Machaty 's famously uninhibited Ecstasy , the outrage of 1932, and, 20 years later, Douglas Sirk 's necessarily repressedbut more subversiveAmerican version, All That Heaven Allows . Ferran revels in the objective correlative as a means to restore something of the novel's archaic essence. Lady Chatterley's Lover  is, after all, a straightforward adult fairy tale about a spellbound princess who wanders into the deep woods and discovers the enchanted rustic cottage where the solitary Green Man makes his home.
Nearly three hours long, Lady Chatterley  passes as swiftly as the summer shower that occasions the novel's most celebrated scenehandled by Ferran with a cool lack of embarrassment. This is not so much a love story (and even less a story about love) than it is a movie of passionate loveliness.
