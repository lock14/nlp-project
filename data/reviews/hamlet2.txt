The psychological repercussions of childhood sexual abuse do not normally lend themselves to great comedy, but thankfully, British comic actor Coogan is so far removed from "normal" as to be living in an alternate, slightly funnier, definitely edgier reality. Best known to tabloid bottom-feeders as the father of Courtney Love's nonexistent, um, love child and the man who may or may not have supplied drugs to a suicidal Owen Wilson ("Coogan the Barbarian!" shouted London's Daily Mail), Coogan manages, somehow, to write and perform lacerating, character-driven, full-contact comedy whenever he has some downtime between outrageous scandals. His masterpiece, to date, is the character of Alan Partridge, a superficial echo of a human being masquerading as an erudite BBC broadcaster/pundit. Coogan inhabits the role of this oblivious, self-important buffoon so fully that viewing I'm Alan Partridge
, one of several BBC shows that have featured the character, feels less like a comic experience than some sort of voyeuristic exercise in self-flagellation (on both sides of the screen). Hamlet 2
, while great, sick fun, never fully lives up to its titular potential, and it's tonally uneven. Unlike Coogan, it both goes too far and not quite far enough in its embrace of everyday madness. (Although once you include a catchy musical number about incest and pederasty, a song which features the chorus "Raped in the face," I'm uncertain if there is anywhere to
 go.) Coogan plays Dana Marschz, a passionately committed high school drama teacher in Tucson who, upon learning that budget cuts will eliminate his class, quickly dashes off a sequel to Hamlet
, hoping that its performance will raise enough money to keep the show (and the class) going on and on. This is hindered, at first, by almost two dozen new drama students, all Hispanic and none interested in theatre, who have arrived to torment him � la Dangerous Minds
. How Marschz, a dangerous mime if ever there were one, reforms his la vida loca
-livin' charges, via the majestically warped Hamlet 2
 � a play which features a sexy, time-traveling Jesus (as in Christ) and a bicurious, doo-wop groove, among other knotty plotlines � forms the crux of the film's borderline-surreal story. Occasionally, Keener (as Marschz's sleazy wife) and a nearly wordless Arquette wander in and out of frame, but like everyone else in this film, they're eclipsed by Coogan's gloriously unhinged performance, which has the lunatic, semi-meta tone of a parody within a parody. Coogan is an utterly fearless performer, which makes his character just a little bit frightening, occasionally unsympathetic, and just unreal enough to feel way too real. There is, as ever, only the most nominal of lines between real genius and a really quiet room at Bedlam, and Coogan, entirely comfortable with making his audience entirely uncomfortable, straddles it with manic vigor, raping it in the face for all it's worth.


The British farceur and TV comic Steve Coogan has been tickling American ribs ever since he landed here with a splash in 2002's "24 Hour Party People." In the new comedy "Hamlet 2," he comes perilously close to wearing out his welcome. It's actually a pretty fascinating sight.
Coogan plays a failed LA actor and current Albuquerque high school drama teacher named Dana Marschz. The character exists in one of two emotional states, insanely perky good cheer or suicidal rage. But the dream of "the theatah" keeps him propped up, even when no one comes to see his crummy school plays adapted from hit movies like "Erin Brockovich." He has two stagestruck acolytes, a virginal bunny (Phoebe Strole) and a closet case (Skylar Astin), but other than that, nothing. Even Dana's own wife (Catherine Keener, looking bored) thinks he's an infantile twerp.
He is an infantile twerp, and Coogan rubs the character in our face like an industrial-strength irritant. This may be one of the most intentionally grating lead performances in a movie since "The King of Comedy," and it takes a kind of weird bravery to jump out of a plane this high without a parachute. I watched half the movie through my fingers, terrified to see what Coogan would do next in his bid to push the character into new realms of giggling obnoxiousness.
The problem is you never believe this delusional pixie could ever function in the real world the rest of the movie's characters live in. After the school cuts back on electives, Dana's drama class is suddenly flooded with the tough crowd - Hispanics in hoodies, and so on - and the students look upon their bizarre new teacher the way you would an epileptic frog, wondering which way he'll jump next.
The teacher sets out to bring his new flock to the flame of drama, and suddenly you realize "Hamlet 2" is going to be a parody of inspirational inner-city high school movies like "Dangerous Minds," the 1995 Michelle Pfeiffer chestnut. If anything, director/co-writer Andrew Fleming (he made the delightful "Dick" back in 1999) isn't sneaky enough about what he's sending up. The shaky camerawork announces it and so, quite literally, do the characters.
The satire extends to giving the chief bad boy (Joseph Julian Soria) parents who are upper-middle-class intellectuals instead of the poor Mexican trash that Dana (and we) assume they'll turn out to be. They object to their son's involvement in the teacher's new play not because it's sacrilegious but because it's lousy theater. And they're not wrong.
The play is called "Hamlet 2" (the first "Hamlet" was fine as far as it went, but couldn't the ending have been more upbeat?) and Dana pours all his daddy issues into it. He writes in the character of Jesus Christ and gives him a musical number, "Rock Me, Sexy Jesus." The school principal reacts as you'd expect and suddenly Dana and his play are First Amendment darlings, complete with a fire-breathing lawyer (Amy Poehler, not given enough to do).
The big show at the film's end is funny enough but terribly predictable in its toothless desire to offend; only the most humorless bible-thumpers won't have a good giggle. The problem is that few movies since "The Producers" have been able to pull off this sort of shock treatment without seeming smug. In desperation, the movie keeps throwing in wild cards, like actress Elisabeth Shue playing a burned-out fictional version of herself. She's charming and so's the notion of a Hollywood starlet gone to ground, but huh?
Worse is that Dana Marschz never gels into a character that makes any sense. A useful comparison is with Corky St. Clair, the deathless theater junkie played by Christopher Guest in 1996's "Waiting for Guffman." The portrayal was cruel but it breathed real life; you could imagine Corky existing (and having a breakdown) off-screen. Not so with Dana, whom Coogan seems to be making up as he goes. The performance is a series of eccentric riffs without any connective tissue. He's acting in a more daring movie than "Hamlet 2" but it's a far sillier one, too: A one-man show with blinders on.


 “Hamlet 2” belongs to the school of free-for-all satiric farce whose creators ball up wads of ideas, apply chewing gum and hurl them against the wall to see what sticks. If the style smacks of desperation, enough of the jokes cling to make “Hamlet 2,” directed by Andrew Fleming, intermittently funny.  The gum is the British actor Steve Coogan’s maniacal portrayal of a spectacularly untalented and self-deluded failed actor and high school drama teacher with the nearly unpronounceable name of Dana Marschz (the mispronunciation is a repeated joke that doesn’t fly).  In his clueless grandiosity, Dana is a cousin of Corky St. Clair, Christopher Guest’s eternally optimistic regional theater director in “Waiting for Guffman.” Mr. Coogan’s rough-and-tumble brand of physical comedy, however, is much closer to Jim Carrey than to Mr. Guest. Dana is not in the least cerebral, even when declaring his credo, “To act is to live.” Less a fully fleshed character than a bundle of tics doing pratfalls, he is a slapstick puppet manipulated by the screenwriters (Mr. Fleming and Pam Brady).  We glimpse Dana’s pathetic show business résumé in television commercials he made for a power juicer and a herpes medication; his mechanical “acting” stretches the definition of the word. As the drama teacher at West Mesa High School in Tucson, Dana specializes in turning movies into theater. (The movie, which was filmed in Albuquerque, repeatedly ridicules Tucson as the cultural backwater to end all backwaters, a fact that the city’s Chamber of Commerce can’t be happy about.) His latest production, a dismal stage version of “Erin Brockovich,” has been savaged by the ninth-grade drama critic (Shea Pepe) in the school paper.  The movie imagines Dana finding redemption at the nadir of his life by writing and staging “Hamlet 2,” a singing and dancing sequel to Shakespeare’s “bummer” (Dana’s word). Until that preposterous triumph,  he is the butt of the movie’s contemptuous humor. Early on we learn that at the insistence of his nagging wife, Brie (Catherine Keener), he has been undergoing fertility tests.  Hoping to improve his sperm count, he wears a ludicrous caftan to classes. He is also a recovering alcoholic who eventually slips.  The Marschzes are so poor they have taken in a cretinous boarder named Gary (David Arquette). Because Dana can’t afford a car, he awkwardly roller-skates to and from school. Ms. Keener is wonderfully abrasive as the disdainful Brie, who decides that anyone (especially Gary) would be a better mate than her husband.  Discouragingly for Dana, his chaotic classes include only two serious drama students: closeted, high-strung Rand (Skylar Astin), a star in his own mind, and Epiphany (Phoebe Strole), a syrupy Christian goody-goody. Most of the other students are rowdy Mexican-Americans, whom Dana, in the movie’s jab at ethnic profiling, mistakenly  assumes to be gang members. The surliest, Octavio (Joseph Julian Soria), is also the most talented and is eventually cast as Hamlet. Unbeknownst to Dana, he is the son of snooty high-achieving intellectuals and has won early admission to Brown.  Dana’s ultimate humiliation comes when he is rudely informed that belt tightening has necessitated the elimination of drama from the curriculum. “Hamlet 2” will be his last hurrah. But when word circulates that the show is indecent, the school cancels it  and Dana moves it to an abandoned warehouse. As community opposition to the production escalates, a strident  civil liberties lawyer, Cricket Feldstein (Amy Poehler), storms into Tucson to make sure the show goes on.  Of the several Hollywood subgenres being spoofed, the Inspirational Teacher film (like “Dead Poets Society” and “Mr. Holland’s Opus,” both of which Dana greatly admires) is the most prominent until the Let’s-Put-on-a-Show genre takes over. By this point the movie is so busy hurling notions at the wall that most of its opportunities for pointed satire are squandered.  The most mystifying joke shoehorned into the film is the sudden appearance of Elisabeth Shue playing herself, as a disgusted refugee from Hollywood who has moved to Tucson to be a nurse. She stops the movie dead in its tracks.  The climactic production, which occupies the film’s last 20 minutes, is a garish hodgepodge in which “Hamlet” is run through a time machine to bring the characters back to life and give it a happy ending. It includes a moonwalking Jesus (Mr. Coogan), a local gay men’s chorus singing “Someone Saved My Life Tonight” and a mildly inflammatory anthem, “Rock Me, Sexy Jesus,” that is one step to the left of “Jesus Christ, Superstar.” It all adds up to the kind of bad family entertainment likely to raise only a few eyebrows.  “Hamlet 2” is rated  R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes profanity and some mildly offensive humor.

You can almost hear the hilarity that must have erupted at the pitch meetings while watching �Hamlet 2,� a comedy with a lot of great-in-description ideas that play about half as funny onscreen. Amusing but unevenly inspired tale of a deluded high school drama teacher�s attempt to stage a career-saving extravaganza has some laughs, to be sure. But it�s anyone�s guess whether the $10 million Focus Features dropped for worldwide rights at Sundance will turn out to be a sound investment or another case of �Happy, Texas�-style festival fever overestimating a pic�s broader appeal.
Things start brightly with clips from the highlights in unpronounceably surnamed Dana Marschz�s (Steve Coogan) professional acting career: notably, commercials for Jack La Lanne�s Power Juicer and herpes medication. 
Flash forward to the present, in which he�s given up the tinsel of Hollywood to teach drama at Tucson�s West Mesa High. His best students (OK, his only students), closeted gay Rand (Skylar Astin) and Christian proselytizer Epiphany (Phoebe Strole), are starring in Marschz�s latest biannual school play, this one a stage version of �Erin Brockovich.� 
Next day, the reviews come in, bringing another scathing notice from the school paper�s critic (Shea Pepe), who looks all of 13 years old. Still, his judgment is pithy.
When the fall brings word that budget cuts will soon eliminate drama from the curriculum entirely, the critic recommends Marschz try creating something original rather than awkwardly transferring yet another popular movie to the boards.
The new semester also brings a surprising surge of enrollees, if only because classes held in asbestos-laden portable classrooms have been canceled and drama is one of the few electives left.
As a result, white-bread Rand and Epiphany are suddenly swamped by a rowdy group of Latino and Latina �gangbangers� (or so Marschz and his pets assume). Once their initial disinterest is somewhat overcome, Marschz discovers an acting natural in the hitherto hostile Haywood (as in Jablowme) aka Octavio (Joseph Julian Soria), casting him as Hamlet.
This sequel won�t be wasting any time on soliloquies -- here Hamlet uses a time machine to reverse the deaths incurred in Shakespeare�s �bummer� original. It also features appearances by Hillary Clinton, Einstein and others, not to mention Jesus Christ (played by Marschz himself) moonwalking on water in the production number �Rock Me Sexy Jesus,� accompanied by a Tucson gay men�s chorus.
Once word gets out, Principal Rocker (Marshall Bell), then the whole community wants to pull plug. Smelling a freedom-of-speech struggle, the ACLU dispatches legal zealot Cricket Feldstein (Amy Poehler) to see that the show goes on. It does -- and if not as intentionally funny as, say, the Broadway opening-night climax of �Stayin� Alive� was unintentionally so, the �Hamlet 2� within �Hamlet 2� proves a colorful exercise in multimedia bad taste.
Talented Brit thesp Coogan is given a little too much rope here, while conversely, some estimable supporting players are given short shrift. Catherine Keener does nail bilious laughs as Marschz�s mate, thesp�s most acidly fed-up wife since �Your Friends and Neighbors� (in which her husband was also a drama teacher). 
But casting a game Elisabeth Shue as �Elisabeth Shue� (who�s given up acting to be a Tucson nurse) is an idea that promises more than is delivered.
David Arquette is barely utilized as the couple�s not-especially-welcome boarder. Slickly handled on a reported $9 million budget, pic reps an uptick from helmer Andrew Fleming�s last bigscreen effort, the widely dismissed �Nancy Drew,� though as cheeky farce, it�s nowhere near the standard of his underappreciated 1999 Watergate spoof �Dick.�
Script, co-written with Pam Brady, is hit-and-miss in terms of verbal wit and individual gags. But package moves along quickly, and overall concept remains amusing even when there�s a dud moment or three. 


Late in the movie, the filmmaker suggests that this child's dream is, in fact, a childhood dream. In a haunting bit of ancient footage, the actual little Azazel is seated at the same round wooden table that functions as the loft's fulcrum, head down, asleep beside an unfinished plate of spaghetti.
Like Momma's Man, Hamlet 2 concerns a childish man's struggle with adult responsibility and, as its title suggests, also a son's relation to his father. Not nearly as uproarious as it should be, Andrew Fleming 's latest high-school farce premiered at the same Sundance Film Festival  where Momma's Man  made its debut and, after a spirited bidding war, was sold for a cool $10 million.
The movie, which Fleming wrote with South Park  veteran Pam Brady , is a sort of backstage Bad News Bears  in which a beleaguered high-school drama teacher (Steve Coogan ) attempts to save his job by staging a musical sequel to the most famous play in the English language. (To add to the fun, his class is heavily salted with lovable, mainly Latino gangbangers.) One of the funniest men in England, Coogan here plays American—which is to say, he projects his character as a sincere idiot. Coogan will do anything for a laugh, and given how little he has to work with, he must. It's impressive that he can fill the screen, though he's still regularly upstaged by Catherine Keener  in her specialty role as castrating spouse, never more inspired than when playing a scene with a margarita as big as a birdbath.
Perhaps because it deals with the anxiety of influence, Hamlet 2  is surprisingly sympathetic to writers: "Oh my God—writing is so hard!" Coogan exclaims at the word processor. He accepts advice from a 12-year-old drama critic and, in the grand finale, is saved by the national press, which rallies around the production as a free-speech issue. Not exactly Springtime for Hitler  , the climactic musical features a "Raped in the Face" number and a familiar-seeming "Rock Me Sexy Jesus" routine in which a beatific, be-fright-wigged Coogan descends from the ceiling to intone: "Father, I forgive you." We know that the now-liberated actor is actually talking about his earthly dad. The show ends with Coogan still suspended in the air—not unlike the movie, which, not quite a parody, is something like a failed metaphor for itself.
