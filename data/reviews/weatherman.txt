David Spritz (Cage) belongs to that dissatisfied modern movie breed of privileged white men who reach some kind of spiritual breaking point and decide to fight back: Think Kevin Spacey in American Beauty
, Edward Norton in Fight Club
, or Michael Douglas in Wonder Boys
 or Falling Down
. Ostensibly a success story, Spritz is a top Chicago weatherman who�s currently under consideration for a broadcasting position on a New York morning show, Hello America
 (co-hosted by Bryant Gumbel, in an amusing cameo). The transfer would mean national exposure, a significant salary increase (from the neighborhood of a quarter-million to a round million, plus endorsements), and career promotion to the top of his chosen field. Yet Spritz (n� Spritzel) is unhappy and feels like a fraud, and the chilly ice- and snow-encrusted Chicago-area landscape (courtesy of Sideways
 cinematographer Phedon Papamichael) reflects his gloom. It�s as if an errant storm cloud from one of his CGI sets is perpetually parked over his head, threatening a downpour but letting loose with only a few scattered showers. Spritz is the son of Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Robert Spritzel (Caine), whose attitude toward David always carries the slightest tone of restrained disapproval. There�s no joy in David�s home life either: He�s estranged from his wife Noreen (Davis), who lives in their lovely two-floor home in Evanston with their children � chubby and sullen adolescent Shelly (De la Pe�a) and teenaged Mike (About a Boy
�s Hoult), who�s in therapy for his marijuana use and is the recipient of unwarranted extra attention from his counselor (Bellows). David wants to fix what ails his children, restore his marriage, and win his father�s respect, but as this desire swells ever greater, the less David knows what to do. His urgency becomes more palpable as his father is diagnosed with lymphoma and his wife announces her intention to remarry. When The Weather Man
 functions in this realm of personal failure it�s at its most heartfelt and universal. Cage does some of his finest work as he flips back and forth between the character�s bouncy, gregarious screen image (always standing in front of a blank green screen) and his sad-sack daily life; meanwhile Caine delivers a triumph of understatement. Screenwriter Steve Conrad has less success with the female characters: The always dependable Davis is forced into shrewish territory, and David�s mother (Judith McConnell) is so barely present that it�s a wonder she�s written in at all. David takes up archery along the way, and the metaphors that arise from that activity are just too painfully trite. Also bothersome is the film�s running gag of people throwing food remnants at the local weatherman: Rather than a means of debasement and/or revelation, it seems more a wily product-placement scheme, as every Wendy�s Frosty, 7-Eleven Big Gulp, McDonald�s hot apple pie, and so on is identified and commented on. This problem of mismatched tones � between the broad and the nuanced in both the film�s comedy and drama � is a problem throughout, and perhaps reflects the film�s interim place in the midst of Verbinski�s filming of the Pirates of the Caribbean
 trilogy. Toward the end of the film Spritzel remarks on his son�s deeds by calling them "an American accomplishment." At once superficial and yet meaningful, the phrase encapsulates the paradox of our � and this film�s � dreams and ambitions.


''The Weather Man" finds Nicolas Cage in a self-pitying mood. In the past, this would have been happy news. Cage in a funk was good for ''Leaving Las Vegas" and ''Adaptation." Even in a movie as imbalanced as Martin Scorsese's ''Bringing Out the Dead," Cage's depression soulfully complemented Scorsese's mania. Those movies gave Cage an opportunity to be inventive and inspired. ''The Weather Man" gives him license to drift for nearly two hours like a parade float.
Cage plays a Chicago TV weatherman who mopes from one scene to the next in a fog of depression. His name, Dave Spritz, sounds heckle-worthy. Dave's ex-wife, Noreen (Hope Davis), is annoyed with him. His father (Michael Caine) is an award-winning author who's never supported him. His teenage daughter, Shelly 
(Gemmenne de la Pena), is overweight (a crime in the movies). His son (Nicholas Hoult) misbehaves. And when viewers -- irate over Dave's inaccurate forecasts -- spot him trudging down the street, they chuck things at him: milkshakes, soda, chicken nuggets. Were ''The Weather Man" purely abut Dave's random victimization and the catharsis people feel in harassing him, the movie would have touched on a weirdly unique cultural phenomenon.
But Dave also has to deal with bad family news. Papa Spritz is dying, and Noreen is seeing someone new. Dave doesn't do much about these developments. He drives his father to the doctor. He enrolls Shelly in an archery class that he winds up taking instead. He sits around with a blank look on his face.
Dave is one of the most ineffectual characters ever to have an entire movie built around him. It looked like the trend of crippling anomie in immature American men (better known as ''emo") had reached its watershed at the movies with ''Garden State" and died with ''Elizabethtown." Now it's infecting wildly successful middle-age men, like Dave.
The film takes too many of its cues from Dave's depression. As it slogs on, the movie's cloudiness starts to feel funereal, which is odd since writer Steven Conrad aims for comedy, possibly even satire. The very best dialogue is vulgar, as when Noreen explains to Dave why she was such a monotonous sex partner for the duration of their marriage. That encounter feels bracing because someone is actually being honest with Dave. Davis is good in these reality-check parts, having played versions of them in ''About Schmidt" and ''Proof." I just worry that her indelicacy, however necessary it is, will turn audiences against her.
But ''The Weather Man" needs more of her exasperation. The movie finds Dave's malaise bittersweet and ironic. Never mind that he's a sad sack off the air. His career rises anyway, like a let-go party balloon: He gets a job offer to do the weather on a national show that Bryant Gumbel hosts.
Throughout ''The Weather Man" you wait for director Gore Verbinski (''The Ring," ''Pirates of the Caribbean") to fill the movie's exquisite framing with the emotional or psychological equivalent of Phedon Papamichael's (''Sideways") cinematography. Instead, we get a vague movie that a few successful but chronically dissatisfied men will be able to call their own. The rest of us will see the film for what it is: a long, cold mumble from the heart.


         What's it like to be a highly paid, highly visible professional buffoon in the midst of an existential crisis? This is the question posed by "The Weather Man," a surprisingly wry, contemplative movie directed by Gore Verbinski ("Pirates of the Caribbean") from a darkly funny and poignant script by Steven Conrad.
 
  It takes a minute to settle into the idea that "The Weather Man," a big studio movie, is really just a movie about a guy who has some stuff to work out. But that's more or less it. At once a frank, funny character study of a not very likable character and a timely philosophical riff on the culture of mediocrity, "The Weather Man" deals in themes usually left to indies. But the combination of Phedon Papamichael's impressive cinematography, which turns Chicago's frozen canyons, gray crushed-velvet sky and cut-glass lake into a mythical landscape, and Nicolas Cage's and Michael Caine's restrained and nuanced performances make the movie feel at once intimate and epic — Homeric, even, as its protagonist navigates treacherous emotional states and familial crises to arrive at a place of, if not peace exactly, then at least exhausted acquiescence.
 


         






    You're not exactly supposed to like Dave Spritz (Cage), a Chicago weatherman who makes $250,000 a year in exchange for, as he puts it, "very little effort and contribution." But it's hard not to empathize with him. For a guy who earns a living from his likability, no one in his life seems to like him very much, least of all him. Dave's problem, or one of them, is that he can't help but notice that he owes his success mostly to a culture-wide lowering of the bar. He doesn't have a degree in meteorology, nor is he particularly good at predicting the weather. What he has is a "refreshing" name (shortened by a producer from "Spritzel"), a knack for waving his arms convincingly in front of a green screen and the kind of nonthreatening, exalted everyman quality that inspires familiarity and random hostility in equal measure.
 
  Dave can't wait in line at the DMV or pick up his daughter from ballet class without being hit up for an autograph or, worse, pelted with milkshakes, piping-hot fried apple pies and Big Gulps from passing cars. Shakes notwithstanding, he has been asked to audition for a spot on a "Today"-style national morning show hosted by Bryant Gumbel, which would lead to national exposure and a salary of almost a million dollars a year.
 
  By every standard contemporary measure, Dave is a winner. He lives in the kind of glass-and-steel tower that is the natural habitat of movie alpha males, and his family resides in a stately North Side manse. But he is brought down by the littlest things — or at least he lets himself believe that he is for as long as he can. It's easier to conclude that his marriage ended over some forgotten tartar sauce or that his father's disapproval stems from his not being able to get change for a newspaper, but as his father, Robert Spritzel (Caine), tells him, "Easy doesn't factor into grown-up life." The thing is, it does in Dave's, at least to some extent — so rather than bolster his confidence, the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity only deepens his sense of doubt.
 
  Plus, he's got problems. Dave's ex-wife, Noreen (Hope Davis, excellent as ever), with whom he still hopes to reconcile, is engaged to another man. His son, Mike (Nicholas Hoult), is smoking pot and receiving some creepy attention from his drug counselor, Don (Gil Bellows). His daughter, Shelly (Gemmenne de la Pena), is overweight, unhappy and terminally apathetic. And his father, a National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize winner and steadfast family man, seems to look at his son with a mixture of bewilderment, disappointment and concern.
 
  If Dave's family situation sounds familiar, the particular pitch of his crisis is not. "The Weather Man" is no rote exercise in movieland redemption. Robert represents a standard of excellence to which Dave aspires but is finally realizing he'll never achieve. As for Robert, those standards have been buried by a junk culture he can't comprehend — it's gotten to the point where he doesn't even understand the language. Horrified by the things his son and grandchildren have to endure — hurled fast food, humiliating taunts, perverted advances — he goes on an impotent rage against words: "What is this? What is this? What's all this 'chucking' and 'sucking' and 'jacking?' "
 
  (And yet it still takes Robert to clue Dave in on Shelly's suffering through ballet class, and that the kids at school are calling her names because of the way her snug clothes reveal more than they should — all of which Dave is too self-absorbed to notice.)
 
  The other factor in his depression is more existential: Dave can no longer imagine that things might somehow turn out differently for him. At the peak of his career, he is coming to terms with who he is even though who he is causes him no small amount of shame. Dave's attempts to connect with Shelly are particularly painful and tender, as Shelly is about as transformed by the father-daughter archery lessons and afternoon shopping sprees as Dave is by the hovering promise of Al Roker-level stardom. If anything, her painful awkwardness highlights Dave's own hangdog feelings of impotence. Rather than jump at the offer at "Hello America," he approaches it gingerly, like a man on his way to the gallows.
 
  Originally set to open last spring, the movie was reportedly delayed due to changes in the management at Paramount and because Verbinski thought an autumn opening would be more appropriate for a movie that takes place during the bleakest part of a Chicago winter. (True or not, works for me.) Or it may, of course, be a sign that the studio had no idea how to sell the movie, an issue that often leads to rumors of failure. Be that as it may, I've always disliked the idea of the marketing cart being put before the horse — the horse just ends up getting hurt. Ultimately, the most problematic thing about "The Weather Man" is also the most interesting: It fits into no discernible niche. Instead, it's a sincere, well-put-together movie about the modern human condition. Hopefully, this will be enough to attract curiosity. After all, it's nice to get into someone else's head for a while, even if the head is being used for target practice.

The conditions of youthful alienation, middle-aged misery, and old-age regret may be bad for the heart, but they're good for art and, face it, great for indie filmmaking. Show me a reasonably contented, emotionally mature fellow with satisfying ties to family and community and I'll show you a guy who has probably never toyed with producing a screenplay influenced by Garden State , In the Company of Men , Happiness , or American Beauty . By now, the indie cinema of anomie, disappointment, and stifled rage is such a familiar genre that within two minutes of affectless voice-over and establishing shots of dead-eyed Americans drinking Big Gulps, we know everything we need to know about the contemporary quagmire in question except, perhaps, which route of indecision and eccentric behavior the antihero will follow on his path to accepting that, for grown-ups, life sometimes sucks.
The Weather Man  is what indie misery looks like when re-created by one of Hollywood's big studios: The emotional visibility is atmospherically limited, but the job of making a muted, intimate picture has been given to Pirates of the Caribbean  director Gore Verbinski, whose instinct is to make something big and the opposite of ruminative. Dave Spritz (Nicolas Cage), the sad sack with the title job, is a Chicago TV personality whose earliest misery was, no doubt, some dumb joke about the surname he inherited from his forebears. Actually, the family name is Spritzel, proudly carried by his father, Robert (Michael Caine), a prize-winning author. Spritz is what happened to Dave when he became a talking head: He knows how to sparkle in front of the camera, but he fizzles off screen every day of his life.
Dave is dazedly related to an irritated ex-wife (Hope Davis), an overweight and unhappy daughter (Gemmenne De la Peña from Erin Brockovich ), and a teenage son (About a Boy 's Nicholas Hoult, growing up nicely) who, while kicking drug problems, can't distinguish between kindness and predatory sexual interest from his counselor (Gil Bellows). And then there's Dave's father, who conveys a sense of lifelong disappointment with his son. Robert affects a tyrannically prissy ignorance of the pop culture in which Dave has achieved a middling measure of success. And in response, Dave has, until now, preferred emotional stupidity and interior blankness to self-awareness. But now, Robert has announced that he's dying. Dave's ex has announced that she's remarrying. Dave's daughter hasn't announced anything, but the inappropriately unflattering clothing she wears screams self-loathing.  And Dave, with a shot at a high-visibility job at a fictional morning show very much like Today   Bryant Gumbel even plays himself as the Hello America  anchor  must decide whether it's okay to be...Dave: sometimes disappointing or disappointed, sometimes clumsy or foolish, and sometimes a disposable celebrity who gets pelted with junk food by strangers  but sometimes, too, just a decent, well-paid, reasonably appreciated, lucky SOB.
Now is as good a time as any to mention that in contemplating his own stasis, Dave takes up archery, one of those metaphor-laden activities with hits, misses, and bull's-eyes so beloved by writers and embraced by cinematographers partial to long shots of lone archers taking aim at outdoor ranges against wintry skies. The Weather Man  luxuriates in its own decorative dreariness  the oppressiveness of malls, traffic, TV studios, doctors' waiting rooms, Chicago weather  but it enjoys its own words even more; the movie is an illustrated short story, rather than a discrete cinematic invention.
And the imbalance influences every performance. Cage uses the dampened inside voice he perfected for Adaptation  so defeated, so in denial of feelings  but the tonelessness only serves to expose the self-consciousness of the dialogue and deadened voice-over in Steven Conrad's screenplay. Given no direction about who the ex-wife is  the women in this picture, including Dave's mother and daughter, are placeholders, not people  Davis can only produce a standard-issue approximation of a once-loving wife who has lost interest in understanding her former mate's neuroses. Even Caine, a wily vet, gives up on defining the implacable father he plays. ''That's quite an American accomplishment,'' he says coolly, proffering wound and compliment in the same breath as he congratulates his son on the glitzy new TV job.  But the reasons for Robert's snobbery, his hauteur, his own disappointment in ''this s--- life'' are never defined. In The Weather Man , the forecast is a never-ending hail of life's crap. But there's no compelling reason to believe the messenger.


One of the biggest downers to emerge from a major studio in recent memory, "The Weather Man" is an overbearingly glum look at a Chicago celebrity combing through the emotional wreckage of his life. Aiming for an Alexander Payne-style synthesis of wry comedy and unflinching character study, pic has been made with the utmost sincerity, but the frankly lugubrious material and barely compensating spasms of humor are all but impossible to warm to, spelling an uncertain B.O. forecast for Paramount.
Uncertainty itself is one of the driving themes of Steven Conrad's script, which treats its protag's vocation as a blunt metaphor for the often cruel and unpredictable nature of fate. At first glance, fortune would seem to have smiled on David Spritz (Nicolas Cage), a successful Chicago weather reporter who's in the running for an even more prestigious job at Gotham-based morning show "Hello, America" (hosted, in an odd cameo, by Bryant Gumbel).
As weather men go, though, Dave has more lows than highs. He's constantly struggling to win the approval of his father Robert (Michael Caine), a dour Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist whose literary gifts appear to have bypassed his son.
Dave also tries in vain to repair his relationship with ex-wife Noreen (Hope Davis), who's started dating another man (Michael Rispoli), and to reconnect with their two children.
Absent any real connection to his dad, son Mike ("About a Boy's" Nicholas Hoult) ends up getting closer than he should to a creepy counselor (Gil Bellows). Meanwhile, overweight daughter Shelly (Gemmenne de la Pena), who casually smokes when no one's looking, sullenly rebuffs her dad's efforts to reach out to her by taking her ice-skating or teaching her archery. The dynamic here -- famous father, plus-size daughter -- at times suggests a simpler and more benign version of the relationship depicted in Agnes Jaoui's superb French-language "Look at Me."
But where that film wisely refracted its storytelling through multiple perspectives, helmer Gore Verbinski insists on digging solely into Dave's head, which turns out to be a singularly unrewarding place to spend 100 minutes. It would take a filmmaker of a certain sardonic temperament, i.e. Payne ("About Spritz," anyone?), to wring both laughter and tears from this scenario, and the filmmakers here ultimately are not up to the challenge.
Cage, sporting one of his least flattering haircuts, makes Dave a writhing mass of insecurities who, in his own words, "can't knuckle down." His Dave is by turns feckless, absent-minded and intensely irritable, capable of extreme profanity and even physical violence when provoked. To Cage's credit, it's a warts-and-all perf, completely stripped of vanity. But there's something crushingly over-deliberate, even suffocating, about the ways the pic chooses to wallow in the character's misery, especially the nonstop voiceover -- essentially a plea for sympathy that becomes more distancing every time it's used.
In the most tiresome (and heavily marketed) running gag, Dave's local celebrity status has made him a figure of perpetual scorn on the streets, as drivers regularly heave sodas, shakes and other fast-food products at him out of their car windows. Gag constitutes either a revelatory look at the downside of fame or the most organic use of product placement in some time.
As a woman trying to stay on good terms with her ex while maintaining a firm emotional distance, the ever-terrific Davis has an invigoratingly tonic effect on the proceedings. It's a refreshingly self-assured characterization that, in some ways, stands in for the audience as a direct rebuke to Dave's frumpy sad sack.
Caine's gloomy turn as Robert is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the picture, though he does eventually let down his guard -- and delivers the film's key line -- with typical grace and understatement. As Dave's mother, Judith McConnell has so few scenes it's a wonder she wasn't written out.
Verbinski, on reprieve from the swirling acrobatics of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise, works overtime to sustain a depressive low-key mood and rhythm, while Hans Zimmer's score provides a jangly, percussive echo of the protag's neuroses. Making the most of pic's Windy City locales, Phedon Papamichael's impressively bleak, wind-chilled lensing is enough to give viewers frostbite.

We may like to think we're cutting some kind of cultural edge, but in terms of movie watching, Americans have become retrogressively old-school: Our indoctrination in the rigid genre codes of the New Hollywood "arc," happy endings, facile character redemption, transparent moralismis as thorough as it was in the 1940s. If a mainstream movie detours onto the pitted back roads of more honest narrative strategies, the experience can seem like being lost in a snowstorm without a guide rope. This is what happens in The Weather Man if it's the most supremely odd American film of the year, that's because it sets us up, amiably enough, for ripe horseshit and then delivers something else entirely. Or doesn't deliver at all, but just is: a shallow study of floundering American dreamism that dares to let unresolved issues and festering unhappiness remain that way. You expect glib answers and throat-forced satisfactions, but they never come. If that's a spoiler for you, your gears may be cranked too tight.
Were screenwriter Steve Conrad  and hack for hire Gore Verbinski who seems here to be palpably searching for the heart and brain no one knew he hadtrying for a 1960s'70s, menopausal-working-stiff New Wave anti-drama (think Save the Tiger ; Rabbit, Run ; Pocket Money )? Nicolas Cage 's titular semi-hero, David Spritz  (né Spritzel), is a hangdog Chicago TV news meteorologist (he has no training or degree and admits his idiotic, overly paid job doesn't need them) at the center of a middle-upper-class meltdown. Spritz's renowned novelist father (Michael Caine ) is permanently disappointed in him, his ex-wife (Hope Davis ) is justifiably appalled by his every fuckup, his obese 12-year-old daughter (Gemmenne de la Peña ) is on the edge of complete noncommunication, and his teenage son (Nicholas Hoult ) is finishing up rehab but otherwise contentedly exhibits no need for a father. Pelting Spritz on the street with half-consumed fast food is a homegrown sport of the Chicago populace. But this maddening schlub's most monstrous problem is himself: He's self-esteem-free, terminally uneasy with virtually everyone, reliable only to do the wrong thing, and ill equipped to handle others' unpredictable emotions. The unforecastability of everything, from weather systems to his own temper, grinds Spritz's teeth; as the story threads roll out (the father's lymphoma, a national morning show summoning Spritz to New York), the seriocomic degradations only snowball, and Spritz futilely struggles toward the same fake triumphs that movies, not life, always promise.
Cage makes for a squirmingly inept everyman, but even he resists showboating. Verbinski doesn't exactly paint with a fine brusha running discussion of the term "cameltoe" is eventually illustrated with a cutaway to a dromedary's footbut it's the disillusioned shape and texture of The Weather Man  that fascinates me. The specific nature of this imploded family is disarmingly particular (they all curse too much, talk about cursing too much, and then helplessly curse some more); de la Peña's impenetrably sullen pre-teen has to be the new century's most realistic, and least cute, movie problem child. Never less than lighthearted, Verbinski's film is finally rather terrifying, a well-intentioned breadwinner's nightmare of male inadequacy.
