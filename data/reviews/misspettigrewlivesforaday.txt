The Blitz was not all chip-rationing and stiff-upper-lipness for the Londoners who endured it � there was also the West End, gin, and the promise of non-Nazi-induced blackouts and sasstacular American movie stars, or at least that's what we have here. As Miss Pettigrew, the unflappable, always appealing McDormand submerges her sense of style and her not inconsiderate wit into the titular character first created by novelist Winifred Watson in 1938. Miss Pettigrew is an unemployed nanny with a no-nonsense streak and an exceedingly dour sense of couture, who bluffs her way into a job as the "social secretary" for the brain-dead, proto-fashionista, Yank-on-holiday starlet Delysia Lafosse (Adams, of Junebug
 and Enchanted
), with appropriately hilarious results. Or maybe not so hilarious, depending on how you feel about P.G. Wodehouse's Jeeves and Bertie stories (which are echoed here), madcap screwball comedies of the Thirties (ditto), and Adams' relentlessly chipper perkiness, which would threaten to tip over into outright self-parody were one not already aware of what a talented comedienne she can be. Watching Adams bat her eyes, grind her hips, and befuddle herself betwixt the revolving cast of semieligible suitors (Pace, Strong, Hinds) who wander pre- and postcoitally into her widespread and indiscriminate arms as she vies for financial security, love, and a plum theatrical part (although not necessarily in that order), is great fun: "What ho, Jeeves!" indeed. (However, watching McDormand read the Manhattan white pages to herself in a dark room would, one suspects, be even more
 entertaining.) Adams titillates, but McDormand fascinates, an important distinction. That Miss Pettigrew, apparently a closed circuit from the start, should in the end outshine her bubble-headed charge, a real live wire from the get-go, is less a shocking discovery than the starting-off point for a swell stage play or, as here, a novel from the prefeminist trenches. The comedic success of this pair of dramatic archetypes, the radiant flibbertigibbet and the gray, lumpen elder spinster, in a lightweight bit of piffle such as this is a testament to both Adams' and McDormand's smarts. It's tough to play dumb when you're not and even more difficult to dial down your own innate brilliance.

Very early in "Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day," Frances McDormand, as the title's bedraggled English governess, knocks on Amy Adams's door. And when Adams opens it, the craziest thing happens: nothing. In "Enchanted," whenever  Adams batted her eyelashes, lilted and intoned her dialogue,  or basically floated around Manhattan, your heart swelled.
This time, Adams isn't playing a cartoon princess in a live-action fairy tale. She's Delysia Lafosse, a randy Yankee starlet in pre-Blitz London. And even though she deploys a similar battery of saucer-eyed looks and sing-songy line readings under cover of coquettish dimness, the Amy Adams Express
 never leaves the station. It's not all her fault.
"Miss Pettigrew" is one of those feel-good British romances, like "Mrs. Henderson Presents," that whips nostalgia, naivete, and a little ribaldry into a sugared wartime pastry. Here is England, blithe and relatively buoyant before the bombs fall. The film is adorable and knowingly unseemly at the same time. At some point, Miss Pettigrew stares at fashionable department-store mannequins wearing gas masks and says it's horrible. "I know," Delysia replies dolorously, "capped sleeves."
The movie's only crime, though, is dullness. Directed by Bharat Nalluri and adapted by Simon Beaufoy ("The Fully Monty") and David Magee ("Finding Neverland") from Winifred Watson's 1938 novel, the movie is weightless enough to make "Enchanted" seem like a physics doctoral thesis. And yet the film fails as pure escapism. You sit wondering whether Delysia will choose a man before the air-raid sirens sound.
Guinevere Pettigrew herself is meant to be a barrier against the frivolity afoot, but the intrigue and glamour manage to suck her in. Fired from what we're meant to understand is yet another job, for doing things her way (the woman's a rogue governess), she steals the address of a prospective client from her agency. It happens to belong to Delysia, who, when she comes to the door, is in the middle of juggling a few suitors. One of them is a young theater producer who's considering her for a part in a new show and who's up in her bed. Another is on his way over. And Miss Pettigrew gamely helps direct traffic. In urgent need of work, she goes so far as to tell Delysia she used to be Carole Lombard's social secretary. Naturally,  Delysia hires Pettigrew to be her own.
In either iteration, these two  - McDormand and Adams; Pettigrew and Lafosse  - should make quite a pair. The uptight Englishwoman and the indecorous American have more in common than they think. They're both desperate  - Delysia for love and fame, Pettigrew for a permanent job. McDormand's balefulness has a glint of sad wisdom. And Adams smartly makes Delysia only half the bimbo she appears to be. Both women have some decent scenes with Ciaran Hinds as a Pettigrew suitor, Shirley Henderson as Delysia's slatternly coconspirator in superficiality, and Lee Pace as the smitten piano man in Delysia's lounge act. (Pace is vaguely more than a poor man's Clive Owen. He's Clive Owen for anybody living paycheck to paycheck.)
Even so, their services have been put to more memorable use elsewhere. This movie jams them all into the kinds of would-be sticky situations that keep a plot humming but flatten out characters. Like "The Other Boleyn Girl," the lousy costume soap opera that opened last week, "Miss Pettigrew" is long on the kind of noise and technical busyness that rarely produces rousing entertainment. That big-band score never seems to let up, so every scene sounds one long brassy note.
The material needs a director who can do more than send a camera gliding across a nightclub or down a catwalk at a lingerie show. It's a polished-looking movie, but all that pizzazz is put to monotonously shallow ends. It would take a star of steroidal proportions to jazz this movie up. If dour Miss Pettigrew does indeed live for a day, good for her. That's 24 hours longer than this movie seems to.

Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day  is set in a fairy-tale 1939 England. Married Life  takes place in an imagined 1949 America. Yet both pictures bear the recognizable time stamp of right now . Don't be fooled by the frothy vision of Amy Adams in draped furs and fetching hats as Miss Pettigrew 's madcap American nightclub singer and aspiring actress, or by the sleek, platinum blond grace of Rachel McAdams as a thoughtful widow in love with another woman's husband in Married Life . These re-created epochal settings, with lavish attention paid to the serving of tea cakes, mask  thoroughly modern, approving attitudes of feminine autonomy and sexual equality, both  by the writers and directors as well as the frisky actors happy to play ''historical.''
And by actors I mean, specifically, actresses. McAdams and Adams are dewy, vibrant stars whose popularity lies in the feminist independence they generously grant to the fictional women they play. How we love the trappings of other periods  provided we can tinker with the period attitudes to suit our current fashions!  Both these slight, wistful movies  evanescent diversions with a combined weight of less than a magnum of champagne  play at matters of financial, professional, marital, and erotic dilemma with all the seriousness of an after-dinner game of charades. Mostly, they each put on a pretty show.
Of the two, Married Life  has more on its mind, manifest in the arch elegance of the plot, a looped chain of infidelities and loyalties meant to comment on the mysteries of marital bonds. (Ira Sachs, who made the outstanding 2005 indie  Forty Shades of Blue , directed, and co-wrote the script with Oren Moverman.) Playing Kay, widowed by WWII and living in an unnamed suburb, McAdams is a particularly delightful vision after her two-year intermission from the screen following The Family Stone . So it's no  stretch to see how a romantic, lonely married  man like Harry Allen (Chris Cooper, wonderfully subtle), missing enough emotional intimacy with his wife, Pat (Patricia Clarkson, Cooper's perfect match), could fall in love with Kay's compassion  or, indeed, how Kay's heart would open to a gentle man who needs her so sincerely. (Pierce Brosnan complicates the plot as Harry's lothario of a single friend, Richard, who also sets his sights on Kay.) In fact, Married Life  is much more about  the enduring relationship between husband and  wife than it is about the excitement between  husband and girlfriend. So sure is Harry that  divorce would devastate Pat that he resolves, out of love, to kill her himself. Married Life  congratulates its audience on a sophisticated, humorous complicity in the obvious immorality of Harry's murder plans, as well as in Richard's own ungentlemanly  designs on his pal's gorgeous girl. Every adult, the movie suggests, has got a secret.
Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day , in contrast, thinks secrets are quite naughty, in a nursery way. But they're also kind of cute, in a British tweedle-dee-dee way. We're meant to cheer when Frances McDormand, as the title middle-aged, prim British miss, desperate for a job, lies  her way into the employ of Delysia Lafosse  (Adams). It's a wonder Miss P isn't carrying  Mary Poppins' tool kit, so useful does she turn out to be for Delysia, who's got two caddish, bedable beaus and one genuine, jazz-piano-playing nobody who honestly loves her (Lee Pace from Pushing Daisies ). Adams, of course, is a peach.  Her sparkle requires only minor character  adjustment and twinkle recharging from her  recent triumph as the old-fashioned modern  heroine in Enchanted .
Delysia's perils and pleasures don't amount to a hill of beans (the movie, based on a forward-thinking 1938 novel by Winifred Watson, is directed by Britain-based Bharat Nalluri). Neither do those of Miss P, who happens to enchant an attractive, mature, successful widower (Ciarán Hinds) of her own in the course of a day's work. Then again, Miss Pettigrew , and  Married Life , for that matter, aren't about the real pleasures and perils of not-too-distant past eras; they're about pleasurable, flattering role choices for popular actresses and their admirers  and about nifty, fun-to-wear vintage costumes, too.

 Acting, of course, has something do with it. But the charm that emanates from Amy Adams like a perfume in “Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day” is also a natural gift.  Her character, Delysia Lafosse, an American actress and singer clawing her way up the show business ladder in 1939 London, may be an amoral, sociopathic vixen. But in Ms. Adams’s portrayal she is also an irresistibly endearing creature of moods and whims, one who melts the hearts of the possessive, egotistical beaus she carelessly juggles while pursuing the leading role in a West End musical. Despite her foibles she is as lovable as Giselle, Ms. Adams’s character in last year’s “Enchanted.”  The particular screwball screen magic Ms. Adams commands in “Miss Pettigrew,” a weightless period fairy tale based on the novel by Winifred Watson, hasn’t been this intense since the heyday of Jean Arthur. For the next few years, until the dew evaporates, all Ms. Adams need do to win friends and influence people is weave variations on this archetype: Ms. Arthur filtered through a flightier Julia Roberts with a dollop of Melanie Griffith.  Beneath their wiles, Ms. Adams’s princesses are true-blue souls who would sooner die than hurt anyone. They’re just a little ditzy.  Without Ms. Adams’s presence, who knows what “Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day” might have been.  As it stands, the movie, directed by Bharat Nalluri from a screenplay by David Magee and Simon Beaufoy, is an example of how a little nothing of a story can be inflated into a little something of a movie with perfect casting, dexterous tonal manipulation and an astute eye and ear for detail.  Delysia’s foil, Guinevere Pettigrew (Frances McDormand), is an impecunious, strait-laced vicar’s daughter and governess. Desperate for work after being dumped by her employment agency,  she steals someone else’s assignment for a job as Delysia’s social secretary. As the down-and-out Guinevere, Ms. McDormand is almost a dead ringer for Carol Burnett playing her charwoman character.  The lair in which Delysia madly flutters is the Art Deco apartment of Nick (Mark Strong), one of her three lovers and the tough, oily impresario of a nightclub where she sings.  Another lover, Phil (Tom Payne), the pretty-boy son of the producer of the musical in which she hopes to star, is in bed with Delysia when Guinevere arrives.  As competing boyfriends are hustled in and out of the apartment, “Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day”  takes on the trappings of a French farce, in which a shocked Guinevere finds herself Delysia’s co-conspirator in deception. Then, for the first time in her life, Guinevere begins to enjoy herself; she discovers pleasure. Ms. McDormand portrays this metamorphosis from glum stoicism to demure radiance with impressive comic understatement.  Michael (Lee Pace), the poor but noble Prince Charming to Delysia’s feckless Cinderella, is a nightclub pianist who has little to offer her other than his talents as an accompanist. But together, he believes, they can ascend to the pinnacle of show business.  The story takes place in a single day during which Guinevere follows her new employer to a fashion show and allows herself, at Delysia’s expense, to be spruced up with a new hairdo and new clothes. As she warms under Delysia’s tutelage, a tentative smile illuminates her poker face.  This being a fairy tale, Guinevere’s deliverance is conveniently at hand in the person of a dashing lingerie designer, Joe (Ciaran Hinds), whose latest collection of elaborate, sexy support garments is unveiled at a fancy private department store showing. Here Guinevere is enlisted by Edythe (Shirley Henderson), a snippy socialite, as an ally in her romantic pursuit of Joe, her sometime fiancé.  The female rivalries never descend to tooth and claw, and the malice is confined to sidelong remarks. No one is entirely dislikable, and as the movie flits from one silly confrontation to the next, it doesn’t waste a moment. Just when you worry that the soap bubble is about to burst, Paul Englishby’s wonderful swing music kicks in.  How light is this movie? So buoyant that even an air raid warning, signaling that this whole world is about to crumble under the blitz, can’t dampen its giddy spirits.  “Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for some partial nudity and innuendo.

Winifred Watson's 1938 novel "Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day" may be small potatoes in the rarefied all-of-life-in-one-day literary realm best exemplified by "Ulysses" and "Mrs. Dalloway," but it still provides enough charm and feeling to sustain a film version 70 years later. After an unpromising first act of misfired comedy, London-set tale of a frumpy middle-aged woman whose fleeting involvement with an opportunistic young actress-singer profoundly alters both of their lives eventually builds enough steam to pay off emotionally. Stars Frances McDormand and Amy Adams will give this highly theatrical thespian vehicle a modest life in cinemas and a more devoted following as home entertainment.
If not previously informed that the film is based on a novel, any viewer would be justified in imagining it originated as a stage farce; long scenes, including most of the opening stretch, are confined to the fabulous art-deco apartment occupied by aspiring star Delysia Lafosse (Adams), while other lengthy sequences are set in the Savoy Hotel ballroom and in a swank nightclub, with characters entering and departing as if on cue.
Style set by helmer Bharat Nalluri (the miniseries "Tsunami: The Aftermath," the feature "The Crow III: Salvation") plays into this format and the theatrical milieu, as he places full responsibility for the film's early effectiveness on the comic timing of his two leads. Unfortunately, this is not immediately forthcoming, as the entire setup of forlorn, unemployed Guinevere Pettigrew (McDormand) chancing into a stint as social secretary to the romantically overextended American thesp Delysia feels arch and forced, obliging composer Paul Englishby to work overtime to provide a little bounce.
A flighty, self-dramatizing beauty, Delysia is the kept woman of tough guy Nick (Mark Strong), in whose club she regularly performs for the swank set of London, 1939. When Guinevere first intrudes into the fashionably appointed penthouse, however, Delysia is entertaining handsome young playboy Phil (Tom Payne), a theatrical producer's son who, provided with the desired fringe benefits, is inclined to cast Delysia in the lead of his own first production.
There's no doubt that Delysia is highly practiced at playing men to her benefit -- a way of life that may not shock the austere, reserved Guinevere but represents an affront to her very being. Desperate for a job, Guinevere is dragged off to a lingerie show at the Savoy, where she falls into an oddly simpatico exchange with manly fashion designer Joe (Ciaran Hinds), whose engagement to salon owner Edythe (Shirley Henderson) appears tenuous.
Back at the flat, yet another man arrives to complicate Delysia's life. Having just finished a short prison stint, Michael (Lee Pace, of TV's "Pushing Daisies," looking like a young Clive Owen) has nothing to offer but his unconditional love and two tickets for the Queen Mary, on which he'll play lounge piano and he hopes she will sing. His intentions are impeccable -- he and Delysia are clearly meant for each other -- but his timing could scarcely be worse.
As pic's deficient farcical elements begin to recede, its moral and emotional underpinnings come gently to the fore. A woman that life has mostly passed by, Guinevere still possesses a very proper sense of right and wrong that makes her the ideal momentary cohort for the self-absorbed Delysia; as Guinevere observes, "I am an expert on the lack of love." Without putting too fine a point on it, script by David Magee ("Finding Neverland") and Simon Beaufoy ("The Full Monty") offers a quiet critique of self-delusion in immediate pre-war Britain and, more generally, of opportunistic behavior at the expense of long-term benefits.
McDormand's performance slowly builds a solid integrity, and contrasts well with Adams' more flamboyant turn, which initially accentuates Delysia's constant role playing but eventually flowers into a gratifyingly full-fledged portrayal of a woman with a past she wishes to escape. Hinds puts real feeling into his work as a self-made gentleman who instantly recognizes Guinevere's fine human qualities.
Shot almost entirely at the Ealing Studios, pic has a luxuriantly upholstered look, fostered by production designer Sarah Greenwood, costume designer Michael O'Connor and lenser John de Borman, that sumptuously expresses the transition from one era to another.


For an obscure tale of a virginal London governess who discovers her true calling running interference for a giddy night-club singer, British homemaker Winifred Watson 's 1938 novel, knocked off in six weeks while she washed dishes under the looming clouds of World War II, has enjoyed a lively renaissance. Republished by the female-oriented Persephone Press, the novel has been retooled by director Bharat Nalluri  as a pert little period costume drama casted, crewed, and crafted entirely by Brits—except for its all-American leads. Don't get me wrong: There's almost nothing Frances McDormand  (as the brown-clad nanny) can't do with a blank stare, and Amy Adams  (dimpling away as the chaotic flibbertigibbet Delysia Lafosse) is rapidly emerging as our wittiest ingénue since Goldie Hawn . But watching McDormand stretch out diphthongs, all I could think was: "What, the Emilys Blunt and Watson weren't available?" What passes for plot is cocktail parties in floor-length Deco gowns, interrupted by the occasional German bomb and the obligatory shopping excursion in which Miss P. gets her extreme makeover and gently instructs her confused young boss in basic self-respect. Were Watson alive today, her comic verve would likely intimidate Diablo Cody . But what makes her novel a delight is its guilelessly homoerotic subtext. By downplaying that, the movie argues the case for Watson's innocent sensuality—and against its own worldly update.
