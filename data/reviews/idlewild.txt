Like Charms Blow Pops, Idlewild
, the highly anticipated film debut of hip-hop superstars OutKast (Andr� 3000 and Big Boi, n� Benjamin and Patton), is two candies in one. Apparently also derived from the confectionary template is this film's eye-popping and candy-colored hyper-stylization. Background items (notes on sheet music, a rooster emblem on a silver whisky flask) come alive, talk, dance, die, possibly to distract you from the fact that, really, not all that much is happening to the main characters, or at least nothing you haven't seen at least half a dozen times before in better films. The whole smorgasbord of treacly clich� is enough to give you a tummy ache in your head, but unlike those glorious Blow Pops of your youth, you can't blow this one up in the microwave or use it to bash your little sister on the noggin. Such is progress. OutKast has been operating as two separate and distinct musical personas for at least three years now, and Idlewild
 unwisely continues this trend into the cinematic realm. Set in the titular rural Georgia township during the mid-Thirties, director and screenwriter Barber (who has helmed sereral OutKast videos) mines every available seam of tired and truthless gangster-era obviousness. Benjamin plays aspiring pianoman and songwriter Percival, who, until very late in the film, seems destined to take up where his mortician father is leaving off. His childhood best friend Rooster (Patton), a scalawag of a different sort, is running moonshine at a local gin joint nicknamed the Church and ignoring his family in favor of cushier chorus-line behinds in his free time. While Percival soon falls head over soul patch for new star in the hood Angel (the luminous, impossibly leggy Paula Patton), Rooster is forced into a managerial position when the Church's owner is gunned down by scheming sneak thief Trumpy (Howard, like curdled butter on burnt toast). Neither one seems all that aware of the gravity of their situations, although that may have something to do with annoyingly inopportune musical numbers that creep up every now and then to little, if any, effect. (At one point there's mention of "CabCal," shorthand for Minnie-mooching legend Cab Calloway, and just for a little while you hope that the famous Harlem hoofer will appear in one form or another; it never happens.) Apart from a third-act backwoods showdown and an ensuing car chase with flivvers going ass over teacup down a dreary country lane as monstrous storm clouds gather overhead, Idlewild
 is utterly bereft of drama. There's melodrama galore, but none of it is anything you'll be humming on the way out of the theatre. Indeed, Andr� 3000 and Big Boi seem to have tin ears all the way through this cluttered, busy mess. There are moments in Idlewild
 that resonate with the painful "if only" of missed opportunity, and more than a few that just make you scratch your head. It's like some wildly overlong music video, minus the sexy thump 'n' grind. It's all blow, no pop.


The big show-stopping number in ``Idlewild," OutKast's eagerly awaited musical escapade, is a brightly lit throwback to a sequence from an old Busby Berkeley picture. The film is set in 1935, and Andre ``Andre 3000" Benjamin glides around a large shiny set full of jiggling female dancers. He sings and tap dances.
The camerawork is steady, the editing patient, the choreography playful. It's a zippy and inspired piece of moviemaking. But there's one problem. It's playing under the closing credits.
After the nearly two hours that precede it, that sequence feels like a glamorous dream, one that ``Idlewild" should have been 100-odd minutes earlier. Instead, it's a sludgy, badly photographed, poorly edited bungle whose musical numbers never pop.
Neither do its two stars, Benjamin and his artistic partner, Antwan ``Big Boi" Patton. They play musicians in a Georgia speakeasy called Church, and, as on their best-selling double-CD, 2003's ``Speakerboxxx/The Love Below," the duo spends very little time together.
Percival (Benjamin) is a mortician's son whose true passion is songwriting. He lives with his daddy in a bedroom with a wall covered in cuckoo clocks. Percival plays piano in Church's house band and starts a thing with the just-arrived beauty who calls herself a singer. She's played by Paula Patton, a woman whose skin is the color of café au lait and whose acting is decaf Beyoncé.
While these two spend the entire movie gearing up for her big number (not a showstopper, mind you -- at least, not in a good way), Rooster (Big Boi ) is trying to keep a slick gangster (Terrence Howard) from taking the nightclub's profits. Rooster is also trying to keep his fed-up wife (Malinda Williams) from taking their five kids and moving in with her momma. (Rooster, like all Roosters before him, drinks, cheats, and struts around in flashy suits.)
Written and directed by music-video maker Bryan Barber, the film is a disappointing collision of Eddie Murphy's ``Harlem Nights" and Baz Luhrmann's ``Moulin Rouge." That's too bad, since the movie ``Idlewild" sporadically evokes, with its fierce cast and would-be jumping musical sequences, is Vincente Minnelli's ``Cabin in the Sky."
Instead, a lot of wasted talent washes up. In addition to Howard, who spends what feels like his first 20 minutes standing in silence behind Ving Rhames, the cast includes Ben Vereen, Patti LaBelle, Paula Jai Parker (as enjoyably uncouth as ever), and Cicely Tyson, who steals her second movie this year. (Perhaps you caught her porch sermon in ``Madea's Family Reunion.") Honestly, though, nobody in this movie out performs his hair. In a Hollywood first, there are enough marcelled waves, perms, S-curls, weaves, wigs, and blow-outs to constitute a black-hair convention.
You wish the best for OutKast onscreen, because musically they've been so good to us for the past 10 years. But neither their songs nor their personalities come to life here. Big Boi at least makes something cool out of his limited emotional range. Benjamin, meanwhile, is often caught looking gravely serious, the way Prince did in ``Purple Rain," a movie it hurts to mention under these circumstances. What Prince lacked in screen presence (he had almost none), he made up for in electric stage appeal. ``Idlewild," meanwhile, is not OutKast at its musical best.
The songs are taken predominately from ``Speakerboxxx/The Love Below," but they're not ones around which you build a musical. The duo released a n ``Idlewild" soundtrack album this week, but little of that new music is featured prominently in the production numbers, all of which Broadway veteran Hinton Battle has choreographed with moxie. Too bad the movie is so over-edited that it's tough to appreciate his work.
In fact, sometimes it's hard to figure out what's happening at all. At some point, Big Boi is making a fast getaway in a speeding car. As he drives, it looks like he's singing the song ``Church," but the camera and cutting can't keep still long enough to prove it. Musicals in the 1970s had a similar on-the-run style, but the best of them knew when to stop and let a sequence envelop you.
In his music-video work, Barber is rarely this careless. True, his videos also suffer from too much cutting, but they're tight and fun confections.
One of his best happens to be for OutKast. ``Hey Ya!" was a manic ``Ed Sullivan Show" tribute, with Benjamin cloned into a Sly and the Family Stone-style band playing on a toothsome spearmint-colored soundstage.
LISTEN TO THE ``IDLEWILD" SOUNDTRACK 
In that video, the girls in the audience have hilarious nervous breakdowns watching Benjamin, who's utterly alive and sexy. Those same girls would be scratching their heads over ``Idlewild." Barber and OutKast haven't found a way to harness their natural wit and energy into a feature-length production. But that glorious closing-credits sequence suggests they shouldn't stop trying.

         The air around OutKast's "Idlewild" is humid and thick as gravy, and I'm not talking about the summer haze enveloping the fictional Southern town where the film takes place. The movie starring hip-hop's top duo and the sort-of soundtrack sharing its name — both out this week — are being greeted with a grim earnestness that seems quite overblown, given that pop stars are always making entertainingly flawed cinematic forays and off-kilter soundtracks to go with them.
 
  Internet tastemakers are declaring "Idlewild" "the end of 'Kast." More positive reviews still say the record's awfully weird. Even the deluge of flattery in glossy magazines, expected for a $27-million HBO-sponsored release, hangs heavy with awkward questions about whether André "Andre 3000" Benjamin and Antwan "Big Boi" Patton are even speaking and which Prince movie will finally provide "Idlewild's" best analogy: the miraculously successful "Purple Rain" or the embarrassing "Under the Cherry Moon."
 


         






    It's not a condemnation to note that "Idlewild" has a lot in common with Prince's first film flop. Both projects followed a breakthrough moment for a forward-thinking act who'd made it deeper into the mainstream than anyone expected: the legendary "Purple Rain" for Prince and the diamond-certified double-disc "Speakerboxxx/The Love Below" for OutKast. Both films tell the classic story of artist as outlaw, sacrificing conventional happiness in favor of sensuality and creative inspiration; Prince's Christopher Tracy is a gigolo shot down while on the run with his forbidden love, while Benjamin and Patton's Percival and Rooster are two small-town showmen who escape drudgery nightly at a joint paradoxically named Church, only to court death pursuing their Cotton Club dreams. Both films draw nostalgic connections between contemporary black culture and the golden age of speak-easy piano-tinkling — Prince went vintage by sporting a pencil mustache and bolero hat; Benjamin and Patton opt for zoot suits and breeches. And both film "soundtracks" (Prince's was called "Parade") touch lightly upon prewar musical styles to further the musical experiments their makers had already begun.
 
  For Prince, that meant mixing funk and psychedelia with a jazz-inspired sense of harmony and rhythm. For OutKast, it means borrowing from Prince — and his own borrowings from disco-era speak-easy revivalists August Darnell, Chic and the Pointer Sisters — to connect hip-hop not just to jazz, but to the stream of backtalk and risk-taking that carried African American artists from blackface to black pride. This reach for the long view lends "Idlewild" the film its best qualities — though certain opportunities remain unrealized — and makes "Idlewild" the album hard to grasp.
 
  Let's consider the film first. Writer-director Bryan Barber's script fruitfully connects hip-hop's gangsterism to a pre-Civil Rights era in which entrepreneurs like Rooster relied on bootlegging, showgirl-pimping and whatever else to get by, despite isolation and discrimination. This was a time of elegance, but also of violence and marginalization, and Barber's bright underworld captures all of that. And choreographer Hinton Battle does an outstanding job showing how break dancing evolved out of the Lindy Hop; the dance sequences alone make "Idlewild" worth seeing.
 
  Visually, "Idlewild" takes the vivid approach used in other semi-surreal period pieces like "Beloved," "Chicago" and especially "O Brother, Where Art Thou"; this isn't a past anyone could remember, it's a past people dream about and turn into myth. The characters Benjamin and Patton play are supposedly autobiographical. They're also archetypal. Patton's Rooster, family man by day and jump-blues singing hooch-runner by night, represents the good man made shady by the system, while Benjamin's Percival, a piano-playing mortician's son who could use to leave the basement more often, is the individualist who can triumph only through the singularity of fame. In other words, Patton is Prince in "Cherry Moon" and Benjamin is Prince in "Purple Rain"; similar characters appear throughout African American culture, including Ralph Ellison's "Invisible Man" and the biographies of Jimi Hendrix and Sly Stone.
 
  "Idlewild" stops short of fully exploring these archetypes. Patton and Benjamin can both hold the screen and are great in their musical sequences, but sorry, they aren't actors — Terrence Howard, as the villain Trumpy, blows them into dust when he's on camera — and their limited expressiveness detracts from the film's hallucinatory edge. The plot fails them too, as it takes turns we've seen in a dozen melodramas. Despite a supporting cast that goes for broke (beyond Howard, Ving Rhames, Faizon Love and Macy Gray stand out), gorgeous costumes, those killer dance sequences and enlivening elements like Rooster's talking whiskey flask and the dancing musical notes that inspire Percival, Barber and his two leads ultimately play things pretty straight.
 
  This isn't what we need from OutKast. With hits like "Hey Ya!" and "Rosa Parks," the duo has come closer to confronting the troubling hyperboles of black American culture — the legacies of blackface and coon song — than virtually any other hip-hop-era artist. OutKast's seriously comic take on black eccentricity speaks volumes about the historical weight of notions like "freakiness." Their film needs more of that freakiness, instead of the three-hankie sentimentality that dominates. In its best moments "Idlewild" connects with OutKast's weirdness, which is an act of resistance: an acknowledgment of how black American expression has been poisoned by stereotypes and an attempt to disrupt those caricatures and make them human again. At its worst, the film trades in the very clichés about romance, redemption and music that listeners run to OutKast to avoid.
 
  Strangely, "Idlewild" the album suffers from almost the opposite problem. It's so sonically challenging and lyrically wide-ranging that it could almost use some clichés. Twenty-five tracks offer outstanding material for contemplation and booty-shaking, including the memoiristic soulfulness of Patton's "Train" and the cosmic reach of Benjamin's "Mutron Angel," which might have been written by dance-rock guru Moby. Yet "Idlewild" leaves the ears longing for something. Coherence, basically. There's no sustaining mood, no clear message, only Benjamin and Patton's efforts to outdo whatever they came up with last. As the music veers from summer jams to fusion excursions, lyrics flitting in and out of focus as the duo contemplates its own inner tensions, the annoyances of the mating game, the threat of hurricanes and the fear of clocks, overload sets in.
 
  Individual tracks shine: Patton's never written a verse as touching as his dissection of a failing marriage in "Peaches," and though Benjamin's a merely adequate crooner on the Cole Porter-ish "When I Look in Your Eyes," he's effervescent sampling a marching band on "Morris Brown" or twisting his tongue on "PJ & Rooster." Even "Bad Note," Benjamin's lengthy descent into stoner rock, offers some pleasures.
 
  Collaborators contribute much — vocalist-consigliere
 Sleepy Brown gives several Big Boi tracks the smoothest ride in town, female guests Gray, Janelle Monae and Whild Peach expand the group's vocabulary, and even the macho rapper Killer Mike adds some useful intonation. And on "Hollywood Divorce," a strange little number that strives to connect goth rock to Compton-style gangsta rap, New Orleans superstar Lil Wayne steals the show with a rhyme so effortless, it's indelible. Plus, it boasts the indefatigable Snoop, reciting wedding vows as if they're a sentence of 15 to life.
 
  Snoop and Lil Wayne, dropping it easy, make their moments on "Idlewild" enjoyable. Elsewhere, effort is what keeps it from being a truly satisfying listening experience. Haunted by accusations of their partnership's demise (as if their relationship wasn't already rocky three years ago, when they released those two solo albums as an ersatz set), Patton and Benjamin seem panicked, unable to put on the brakes to enjoy what talent and success have granted them. They're taking chances, but not for the right reasons.
 
  The aura surrounding a release can't help but affect the way one hears it, and in a year or two, "Idlewild's" reckless gamble could sound different. The millions who will surely buy this album would be wise to keep it on the shelf for a while, and to play around with ways of listening — program your player to hear only half the cuts, for example, or create your own sequence. A great album could still emerge from its confusion. After all, "Under the Cherry Moon" flopped two decades ago, but it seems quite charming today.   

In Idlewild , the madly soulful and enjoyable period musical romance starring the two members of OutKast, the '30s Prohibition nightclub where most of the action takes place looks, at first, to be a deeply familiar setting, reminiscent of other heightened movie-dream cabarets, like the ones in Moulin Rouge  or The Cotton Club . This one, though, isn't a world-famous big-city venue; it's a speakeasy in Idlewild, Ga.  the sleazy hub of fun and danger in a sleepy small town. It's a place run by croaky hustlers and ice-cold gangsters, where people come to cast off their identities and, in the process, reveal who they are.
The movie was written and directed, in his feature debut, by Bryan Barber, who made a handful of OutKast's irresistible music videos, notably the Ed Sullivan-on-acid jam bash ''Hey Ya!,'' and he establishes the club as a place of swirling pleasure and danger. On stage, Rooster, played by Antwan A. Patton (a.k.a. Big Boi), is the headlining rapper, and he clicks out the words with such lickety-split velocity that you're on the edge of your seat trying to take them all in. The people dancing in front of the stage are like a stylized funk mosh pit.
Yes, you heard right: Rooster raps. This is one of those post-MTV modern-music-in-an-old-setting movies, yet here, as in Moulin Rouge , the conceit doesn't take a lot of getting used to. Idlewild , more than anything, is a jazzy experience  a free-form improv riff on old movies  and it's not a big stretch to hear the songs of OutKast, even when they're more energetic than inspired (as is often the case here), as an heir to jazz anarchy. André Benjamin, looking as solemn as a statue of one of the founding fathers, with eyes that speak volumes he'll never say, plays Percival, who lives with, and works for, his stern, widowed undertaker dad (Ben Vereen). Benjamin brings off the considerable trick of making silence speak, yet Percival has a hidden crazy-cool side. He sleeps under a dozen cuckoo clocks (they accompany him in one of the film's best numbers), and he's the club's onstage piano player, composing music he shyly longs to share. This is, among other things, a movie about a mortician who learns to get his groove on.
Idlewild  is a romp, a ticket to rowdy good times, yet from the charming  opening-credit sequence, in which we see Percival and Rooster as young boys bouncing between funerals and bootleggers, it shouldn't be confused with one of those movies in which hyperactive ''flash'' compensates for a half-baked story line. The film has movement, but it also has gravitas. I'm not sure what OutKast fans, let alone the Snakes on a Plane  crowd, will make of it, but Idlewild  is a film of spiky delights  a vision of African-American pop culture rising above the heartache and sin that has nurtured it.
Off stage, Rooster sleeps with chorus girls and floozies, keeping as far away as he can from his wife and his brood of kids. The movie tweaks Rooster's transgressions lightly, yet it doesn't let him off the hook; Patton, in a deft performance, makes him a party monster with a sense of shame. When Terrence Howard shows up as Trumpy, a dapper, soft-voiced ''businessman'' who wastes no time bumping off his adversaries in order to take over the club, it is, in a sense, a standard gangster's rise to power, except that the face-off between Trumpy and his rivals, like the raspy hog hedonist ''Sunshine'' Ace (Faizon Love), has a different texture from the dynamic among white movie gangsters. The assertion of criminal power is, if anything, more of a violation here, because these men presume, on some level, to be brothers stuck in the same boat. Playing a heavy, Howard summons an elegant ruthlessness; as Trumpy, he displays an indifference to those ''beneath'' him that is quietly, almost obscenely disdainful. Trumpy puts Rooster in charge of the club, only to drown him in debt, jacking up the price of illegal booze, and the effect of this backdrop of exploitation is to raise the stakes of everything that happens.
The most exciting thing that happens is that a singer named Angel Davenport walks into the room, and  I don't get to say this often  a star is born. Paula Patton, who had a small role in Hitch , is as gloriously gorgeous as the young Whitney Houston, and she acts with an eagerness and hope and pain that electrifies the movie. Angel isn't free of sin herself, yet when she stands on stage, singing the numbers Percival has written for her, she's like dynamite wrapped in silk. The love story between these two is the heart of the movie. Can they save each other? By the end of Idlewild , you'll be yearning, if not shedding a tear, to find out.

 The joint doesn’t jump in the musical “Idlewild”; it just twitches and stumbles. As much a missed opportunity as a terrible tease, the film stars André Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton, better known as André 3000 and Big Boi of the hip-hop group OutKast, playing lifelong friends living and sometimes singing in Depression-era Georgia.  Their characters, Percival (Mr. Benjamin) and Rooster (Mr. Patton), have reached adulthood by going down radically different roads, an approach that will be familiar to fans of OutKast, well accustomed to its creative dissonance.  A great or even good version of “Idlewild” sounds heavenly. The shy and retiring and very single Percival works for his father, a gruff, unsmiling mortician played by a persuasively vinegary Ben Vereen. Rooster, meanwhile, married with a half-dozen children, earns his comfortable keep as a singer down at the local juke joint, called Church. Rooster is all crow and plenty of show, and the first time he takes the stage in “Idlewild,” he enters wearing a fur coat that looks like a skinned yeti and surrounded by a chorus of beauties in bubble-gum pink ostrich feathers. Like most of the songs in the film, what he sings isn’t especially memorable, but he delivers this disappointing news with style.  The rest of the news is equally bad, alas. The writer and director, Bryan Barber, a music-video auteur with loads of credits, seems to have riffled through the Warner Brothers film catalog to compile enough chestnuts to take him and his crew through several Christmases. Without any ironic inflection, he recycles ideas and tropes that were stale when Edward G. Robinson was chewing cigars and scenery in the 1931 film “Little Caesar.” When a wife in  “Idlewild” pleads with her wayward husband by imploring him to remember the way it “used to be,” his only response is to call her baby and ask for her trust. And when someone gives the same man a Bible, you know that good book will save him, body and soul.  There are more clichés, including a beautiful singer, Angel (Paula Patton), who strolls into  Church one day and tries to steal the show. Ms. Patton is a lovely woman with a serviceable voice, but when the fabulous Macy Gray is in the house, as a loud canary named Taffy, Angel can’t help but seem beside the point. (It’s disconcerting that Ms. Patton, by far the most glamorized female lead, also has the palest skin.) Like clockwork, Angel hooks up with Percival, who tends to otherwise mope about idly tickling piano keys. A Jelly Roll Hamlet in search of a reason for being or maybe just for leaving the small town of Idlewild, Percival has talent and apparent depth, which Mr. Benjamin conveys principally by looking downcast.  Neither star is well served by his  director, but Mr. Benjamin is  particularly let down because he has, in the past, dazzled whenever a camera has been pointed at him. Given both his interest in film acting and the limited role historically assigned to black entertainers, you can understand why he doesn’t want to smile for his first big film role. But there’s a difference between being a serious actor and being a wet blanket, and Mr. Benjamin and his director have neither the experience nor the instincts to make sure that Percival has sufficient emotional shading. If Mr. Patton fares better it’s largely because Rooster, with his lust for life and outsize personality, has been drawn with broad strokes that make sense for the real-life singer and his fictional self.  In an interview this summer, Mr. Barber expressed a long-held desire to direct what he called a “1930’s musical”; he might have done well to actually watch a couple before he started shooting. Busby Berkeley, the brilliant choreographer of 30’s musicals like “42nd Street,” could have taught Mr. Barber something about moving bodies and cameras through space. A close study of one of Mr. Barber’s professed touchstones, Vincente Minnelli’s 1943 all-black musical “Cabin in the Sky,” would have been similarly instructive. Mr. Barber loads his visually incoherent film with poor camera choices that make it difficult to ground yourself in a scene and that, with the grievous overediting, make it hard to appreciate the actual talent on screen.  On the rare occasions when the camera sits still long enough for you to get a sense of space and place, the editing invariably reduces the image to confetti-size bits. That’s a shame because the choreographer, production designer and costume designer have done nice work, even if the women’s nails tend to look more Beverly Hills contemporary than Southern period. Still, the real trouble isn’t  the rapidity of the edits; it’s that the editing choices generally lack rhyme and narrative reason. This kind of overediting can murder a mood and undercut a performance, turning what should have been an intimate love scene with Percival and Angel, for instance, into a jumble of shots, some only as long as one or two seconds.  The narrative compression that works so well for Mr. Barber in his music videos for OutKast, particularly in pastiches like “Hey Ya!” and “Roses,” damages “Idlewild” beyond repair. Instead of letting a scene play out to the natural ebb and flow of conversation, Mr. Barber rushes in, moving the camera here and there, and seemingly running from a fine cast that also includes Terrence Howard, Cicely Tyson and Ving Rhames. Like too many young directors, Mr. Barber seems in the grip of a kind of creative attention-deficit disorder, caused less by the digital tools at his disposal than the lack of good guidance. Too bad Arthur Freed, who produced a number of musical masterpieces for MGM, wasn’t around to show him how it’s done and say, “Once more, from the top....”  “Idlewild” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has female nudity, adult language, hooch and suspicious-looking clouds of “cigarette” smoke.

"Idlewild," aka "The OutKast Project," achieves magic--something sorely missing from so many movies these days--and does so via a philosophy of respect, but not reverence, for what's come before it; it never recycles, it just reimagines. With its two platinum-selling pop stars, propulsive musicality and a something-for-everyone approach leading to a huge payoff, pic should not only lure its target fan base but achieve crossover success as well.
Fashioning his musical fable like a Warner Bros. Prohibition drama in which production numbers erupt at the local nightclub, writer-director Bryan Barber has absorbed all the gangster tropes, along with a healthy dose of Coen brothers' irrationality, "Cotton Comes to Harlem" comedy and Terry Gilliam-style animation.
Andre 3000 and Big Boi -- aka Andre Benjamin and Antwan A. Patton -- mount musical numbers that are incongruous, but only to a point: Given the sense of enchantment with which Barber sets up his film -- with the playful manipulation of archival photos, notation dancing across pages of music, a talking whiskey flask and various effects-driven visual pranks -- he has created a universe in which rap, swing, Ma Rainey-style blues (as performed by Macy Gray) and special effects might very well co-congregate in a place like Church, the Georgia speakeasy where so much of "Idlewild" unfolds.
Percival (Benjamin) and Rooster (Patton) are childhood friends who seem destined to go into their fathers' businesses -- in Percival's case, undertaking; in Rooster's, bootlegging. But between mortuary duties, Percival plays piano at Church, which is owned by the unpleasant Sunshine Ace (Faizon Love) until he, and the gangster Spats (Ving Rhames), are ventilated by the even more unpleasant Trumpy (Terrence Howard).
Trumpy -- more evidence that Howard is among the best actors working -- is a sociopathic free-lance thug who puts the squeeze on Rooster, once Rooster has inherited the club.
In between juggling women, deceiving his wife (Malinda Williams) and performing his own explosive numbers at the nightclub, Rooster has to make money and keep from getting killed.
Barber's background in musicvideo -- including his genre-blending work with OutKast -- is obvious, both in his acrobatic camera and his leisurely approach to the actual narrative. A story really doesn't start until about 30 minutes into the film, but there's so much going on, few will complain.
Once Barber jump-starts the narrative -- which includes an ill-fated romance between Percival and show-biz hopeful Angel Davenport (Paula Patton) -- it follows a rather predictable path. What keeps "Idlewild" from idling is the ornamentation -- music, manipulation of image and stylistic unpredictability.
Barber is in total control. From the staccato gestures of figures over the opening moments, to the way dance girls move like silent movie characters in old, mistimed "flickers" to the stammer of one of Trumpy's henchmen, Barber infuses his film with a sense of rhythm -- and this is in addition to the music itself.
"Idlewild" may not succeed entirely in terms of story structure, dramatic motivation or acting (both Benjamin and Patton are good, although Patton is the one the camera loves). But it has such ineffable charm and pure entertainment value, it's hard to imagine auds going only once.

One of the weakest and most ridiculous aspects of popular culture is its narcissistic now-ness. There's often no then or later, and without past experience or the messy knowledge of life, modern entertainment media often seems poached in a neurotic teenage brainpan, entranced with its own ignorant tunnel vision. A quick-fix solution is simply to reach back and engage with yesteryear, and few recent Hollywood  films have done this with as much loose energy and invention as Bryan Barber 's Idlewild . Set in a 1935 Georgia backwater with a nonetheless busy moonshine industry and a funeral home the size of Tara, the movie assembles a Depression morphed and tickled with hip-hop, digital animation, and movie memories. But Idlewild  has a sober, loving respect for history and the old South, and thereby grants itself a measure of distinction.
It's also the most substantially conceived movie vehicle hip-hop stars (here, OutKast 's André "André 3000" Benjamin  and Antwan "Big Boi" Patton ) have ever gotten, which isn't saying a great deal. Idlewild 's thicket of genre-stuff does suggest, though, that ironic riffs like Francis Coppola 's The Cotton Club  and the Coens' Miller's Crossing  are already old enough to be homaged themselves. Tinted sepia and dolled up in supreme period duds, Barber's all-black universe revolves around surely the era's only nightclub/speakeasy/whorehouse with fire-breathing, body-painted strippers, a cavernous enterprise with chicken coops onstage, and a seething backstage warren of clutter that never, despite the film's reputedly tiny budget, feels redundant. The opening-credits sequence is nostalgic and lovely, an archival reminiscence by Benjamin's Percival about his motherless childhood spent in a mortician's office, elbow-rubbing with rum runners, mourners, and Rooster, a wily orphan as rootless as Percival is confined. From there, the two pals' stories run more or less parallel: A faithless family man and "singer" on the club's stage, Rooster (Patton) witnesses his boss getting whacked by a rabid hood (Terrence Howard , out-acting everybody), and thereby inherits the establishment's debt and managerial duties. Meanwhile, piano player Percival, who works dressing corpses by day under the eye of tyrannical dad Ben Vereen , meets cute with an out-of-town chanteuse (Paula Patton , no relation).
Ever since Liza Minnelli  ceased being a movie star, making musicals has required the steely self-absorption of a penitent, and never less than when a heartsick Benjamin rises in the morning below several dozen synchronized, chorus-singing cuckoo clocks, and warbles about destiny and loneliness. Most of the numbers flow from the nightclub stage, armed with video- rehearsed dance routines and Barber's frantic editing, which always cuts on the upbeat movement but could give you a tic as well. (When Paula Patton's nervous diva belts out a few notes in a single shot that lasts six or more seconds, it feels like a cold cocktail in a sandstorm.) Barber even bullet-time-slo-mos the hoofin' acrobatics, reminding me of Winter Olympics replays. Offstage, the songs are outrageously wrong but have a stubborn absurdity, especially when Patton's Rooster raps out a duet with his (animated) drinking flask while driving in a dusky, tommy-gun-peppered car chase.
OutKast themselves are a bit of a muddle: Patton, having made a fortune with hip-hop's standard-operating-procedure supercool introversion, rarely opens up and actually acts. Benjamin, stuck with a mopey role, fares better, and carries with him (as in John Singleton 's otherwise shruggable Four Brothers ) a self-pitying darkness that's not on the script page. But his post-climactic ballad, warbled over an undertaker's slab, can only produce sympathy for the uneasy performer, not his heartbroken character.
Unfortunately, Idlewild  grows more conventional and slack as it rolls on. The gang war we're promised never coalesces, Percival's romance takes eons to consummate, and for long stretches everyone seems to be waiting for someone else to push the old-fangled story over the next edge. I would've appreciated, too, an even deeper sense of the era, when individuals as old as Ving Rhames 's crime boss or Bill Nunn 's hooch supplier would've remembered slavery. As it is, though, and easy for me to say since I'm as white as toothpaste, it's a pleasure to note Idlewild 's racial self-assurance, which owns the caricatures as well as the stereotype busters and bullishly obviates any potential NAACP  objections. (Its regard for women, however, isn't far above the hip-hop schema of crazy whores and nagging wives.) The film is so cornpone that class and poverty aren't even issuescrime and decadence are their own reasons to get the hell out of Georgia while the getting is good.
