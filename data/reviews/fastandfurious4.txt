Back in 2001, when we first met renegade street racer Dominic Toretto (Diesel), he was jacking DVD players from big rigs. My, how the times have changed: In this third sequel in the Fast/Furious
 franchise, Toretto and his team have moved on to an elaborately staged highway heist of � an oil truck. (What's next? Faster, Furiouser, and Stealing Food Stamps
?) In fact, it's a marvelously staged and shot opening sequence, the first of a half-dozen or so car races that blessedly put a brake stop to every leaden stretch of dramatic interplay. (There's also a halfhearted chase on foot, but really, in the era of Bourne and Bond, what's the point?) Fast & Furious
 reunites the original four leads of flagship film The Fast and the Furious
: Toretto; his snarly girlfriend, Letty (Rodriguez); his little sister, Mia (Brewster); and onetime friend Brian (Walker), an undercover cop who meant to bring down Toretto's smuggling ring but instead fell in love with Mia � and not a little bit with Toretto, too, with his fast cars, otherworldly pecs, and code of honor. That dynamic ��among characters and, perhaps, among the actors portraying them � continues in Fast & Furious
, and it's one of the sidelong pleasures of the piece: to watch now-FBI agent Brian trailing Toretto like some eager, gently abused younger brother, and to contrast Walker's pretty, blank aura of bro-dom with Diesel's essential badassness. (The bald pate, the Hulk proportions barely contained by an undershirt, the delivery of every line with the same monotoned husky menace � all this would be risible were it not for the feeling that Diesel's in on the joke.) The story, by Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson, is a bust � a standard-issue revenge tale � and is slickly interpreted by Lin, who also directed the more or less stand-alone The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift
. Nothing here hews remotely close to reality: certainly not the slo-mo pans of scantily clad women groping each other at house parties and parking lot raves nor the continued employment of Brian, quite possibly the world's most incompetent cop. No matter. The stripped-down title gets at what we're really here for: the cars. Are they fast? Check. Are they furious? Yep. Does the heart rate respond in Pavlovian fashion to every shot of a speedometer rising, every pedal pushed to the metal? Sure thing. One wishes Fast & Furious
 had the whole package � as much smarts as speed � but as an uncomplicated, undemanding lark, it'll do.

By the fourth installment of the franchise, "Fast & Furious" has shed two articles from its title, regained the four original lead actors (the previous film, "Tokyo Drift," had none), and turned shamelessly into a monotonous unofficial edition of the Grand Theft Auto gaming series. It is not wisdom we seek here: We want dust in our faces, vroom in our ears, and better enunciation from Vin Diesel. But there is wisdom all the same.
Coursing through the new film  - in which FBI agent Paul Walker infiltrates a massive heroin cartel alongside Diesel, his estranged car-thief buddy  - is an evolutionary revelation. Before we become our cars, we first must turn into their GPS devices. Listen to the command-oriented dialogue, and you'll hear it:
"Let's make some money!" says the fierce Michelle Rodriguez as she commandeers a speeding oil truck in the Dominican Republic in the opening scene.
"Just do it!" someone says as the heist goes wrong.
"Satellite linkup engaged."
"The window's closing fast!"
"15 seconds!"
"Into the tunnel! Use the tunnel!"
The women, especially, speak in such instructional or imperative bursts. One even positions herself as an actual directional guide: "There can be no margin for error," "You must follow my every decision," etc. For good measure, a real GPS dictates a drag race: "Proceed straight ahead," "Rerouting. Rerouting."
What was fun about "The Fast & the Furious," when it arrived at the start of this decade, was the vibrant multiracial subculture it presented. Young lower-middle-class men and women orbiting tricked-out Maximas, Chevelles, and GT-Rs. The 1950s beach movie had been reconfigured for the street. By 2009, the franchise has nothing new to offer. The culture, through video games and reality television, has caught up to the series and surpassed it.
Now everything seems derivative. When Diesel's character, Dom, stares at skid marks on a road and is able to solve a murder through visions, you wonder: When did he become Patricia Arquette on "Medium"? The zooming but matter-of-fact integration feels  - well, pedestrian, amid the cockfights, drug world cliches, and girl-on-girl-on-girl tongue baths. Worse, in too many of the action sequences, it's hard to tell where the true physical stunt work ends and the digital fakery begins.
Through it all Diesel, Walker, and Jordana Brewster, who's back as Diesel's sister and Walker's ex, continue to fuel suspicion that they're part machine. Their expressions never fully download from the server. These are not faces that say "I'm happy" or "I'm mad." They say, "Rerouting. Rerouting."

Recession has hit the world of B movies: There's no longer a budget for definite articles in titles. Fast & Furious , about dirtied-up car racing and badass drivers, arrives eight years after The Fast and the Furious  revealed the unlikely charms of the sewer-throated, shovel-headed Vin Diesel. Back then, as Diesel's Dominic Toretto burned through L.A. streets, we gasped, Who is that walking Popeye, and why does he sound like he's in a Sylvester Stallone tribute band?  Back then we also met Dom's nemesis, Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), an equally feisty driver (and, as it happened, an undercover cop) as blond and blue-eyed as Toretto was bald and swarthy. We met Dom's cute sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster), who loved Brian, and the tough-babe driver Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who loved Dom. Mostly we met hot rods driven by hot dogs  and although the movie was no Point Break , it was great to rocket along for the nitrous-injected ride. The Fast and the Furious  celebrated great music, cars, and minimally clothed chicks cast as extras.
Later on, Dom became a fugitive in Mexico, Brian went to Miami (in 2003's 2 Fast 2 Furious ), and the F&F  franchise took an invigorating global detour to Japan (2006's The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift ), where Diesel's Dom showed up for a cameo. Now the original gang is reunited in L.A. for a victory lap, and they're looking pretty fly for old-timers. The music, strong on reggaeton, still pulses. The chick  extras still favor bikini tops. The stars' jawlines are slightly softened, and the lived-in look suits them. (The plot, for what it's worth, is about chasing down a nefarious drug lord  who happens to be hiring guys who can drive real fast.)
Fast & Furious  is still no Point Break . But it's perfectly aware of its limited dramatic mission, and sturdily directed by Tokyo Drift 's Justin Lin with space for a global audience to talk back to the screen. And in the jammed landscape of mass-market new releases, it offers an attractive getaway route from self-importance, snark, and chatty comedies about male bonding. Here, stick shifts do the talking.

 The tagline of “Fast & Furious” promises “New Model. Original Parts.” Well, yes and no. “Parts” is a remarkably apt way to describe the people of the movie, a crew of affectless hard bodies reunited from the 2001  B-movie sensation “The Fast and the Furious.”  Led by Vin Diesel, an inexpressive chunk of man whose actorly range is largely restricted to the occasional furrowing of a brow, the cast is slotted into a narrative involving revenge against a Mexican drug cartel, outlandish vehicular mayhem, flaunting of custom bodywork (both automotive and anatomical) and settings that encourage people to wear tank tops.  As for the newness of the model, the script (by Chris Morgan) is primitive at best, while the direction (by Justin Lin) is more or less functional. Less, in fact, would have been more: “Fast & Furious” could stand to lose 20 minutes to suit its truncated title.  This inoffensive if uninspired example of presummer pop diversion will be best appreciated by future audiences flabbergasted by its unabashed revelry in fossil-fuel consumption.  “Fast & Furious” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for outrageous moving violations and tough-guy talk.

A series that's provided a successful, moderately enjoyable ride up to now blows its tires, gasket and transmission on its way to flaming out in "Fast & Furious." Trying to refill the franchise's tank by bringing back the four stars of the 2001 original, the producers forgot to get a script worth shooting, resulting in a picture that's all hollow posturing and indiscriminate action cut in incoherent "Quantum of Solace" fashion. These deficiencies may not matter that much at the B.O., where the "Furious" films have continued to prosper, particularly internationally, but this is by far the weakest entry of the four.
Hard to believe, but it's been eight years since Vin Diesel and Paul Walker strapped in for their first mad race through the L.A. streets. Physically, the years have been kind to them as well as to female co-stars Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster -- career-wise, it's been erratic for them all -- but that still doesn't prevent the two men from looking like the oldest guys at the nocturnal street parties where the gaudy cars and chicks gather to watch the drivers outspeed the cops.
Not that the series' races were ever exactly realistic, but the new pic's opening sequence announces that, this time, they will stem solely from the fantasyland of videogamers. Stuck in the Dominican Republic after having disappeared into Mexico at the end of the first film, bad boy Dom (Diesel) tries to hijack a double-sectioned petrol truck along with g.f. Letty (Rodriguez) and some others in an operation that's too physically preposterous to generate any excitement or suspense.
The unfortunate aftermath of this fiasco prompts Dom to return to Los Angeles, where he reunites with sis Mia (Brewster). Walker's Brian O'Conner (who, unlike Diesel's character, also appeared in the series' second, Miami-based installment) is back in town helping the FBI track down elusive drug kingpin Braga. Despite a longstanding relationship that wobbles between wariness and enmity, and is complicated by Brian's having walked away from Mia eight years back, the men team up to penetrate Braga's organization, which conveniently overlaps with the local illegal street-racing scene.
The dynamic of every aspect of the script by Chris Morgan ("The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift," "Wanted") suffers from having been played out anywhere from one to 1,000 times too many: macho guys marking their territory and drawing lines in the sand, law-enforcement bosses berating a loose-cannon operative, drug lords turning on a dime from charming to lethal, a dumped girl's bitterness caving to renewed physical desire, outlaw types living by cowboy codes of honor, justice and revenge. As Brian explains to Mia, "The one thing I learned from Dom is that nothing really matters unless you have a code." If there's an original scene in the film, it's subliminal.
The street racing is visualized as much by GPS devices (accompanied by automated vocal directions) and computer effects as by the real internal combustion deal, and not one but two crazy chases take place in a tunnel connecting the U.S. and Mexico that provides all the photographic possibilities of a gopher hole. If the film hasn't already self-destructed in everyone's minds by this time, it definitively does in a ludicrous exchange between the good guys and bad guys in a warehouse, a scene that makes no sense on any level.
Without the cultural aspects of "Tokyo Drift" to distract from an indifferent story, director Justin Lin is stuck trying to salvage an old heap that's well past its warranty expiration. Time for everyone to move on. 


With the molded-rubber face of Savalas, the basso profundo of Stallone, and the name of an underdog gas alternative, Vin Diesel s already-dubious ripped-tough-guy star has dimmed enough to warrant a return to the car-chase series that made himand money. In the latest, notably slack Fast & Furious  (number four), incidental beatdowns are often more exciting than the flaunting of reinforced-steel nerves during cruddily shot speed-racing.
Diesel reprises the role of larcenist/muscle-car- enthusiast Dom Toretto  and stars opposite Paul Walker whose Timberlakean build could fit inside Diesels bulk twice overas the import-fancying undercover agent Brian OConner, our stand-in for Guy with Most Awesome Job Assignment in the World (with his pick of cars from the impound lot). The untimely death of Doms partner-in-crime, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez ), sends the rivals converging on thoroughly unremarkable drug-runner Campos  (John Ortiz ); they infiltrate his surefire business model of smuggling heroin across the border via inconspicuous hot rods.
The highlight remains the advertisement: The movie opens with the broad-daylight fuel-tanker hijacking from the no-introduction-needed trailer, but never recovers the hand-rubbing glee of that modular stunt. For a better sense of the movies other road sequences, note that the press-kit blurb for Diesel, a WoW and D&D maven, climaxes with his video-game production shingle. Pointing out Xbox  aesthetics has become as familiar a move as bemoaning the continuing disappearance of the frame in mainstream cinema, but sequences in Fast & Furious   are as up-front about imminent adaptation to video game as some directors used to be about accounting for future TV broadcast.
The blindered, vectored-wall look of a tunnel dash to Mexico is straight-up first-person consolean unreal nowhere-space in a genre reliant on door-rattling thrillswhile the Campos-sponsored recruitment race in Koreatown features constant GPS street mapping and a disembodied female voice giving updates with tranquilized urgency. Beer-ad nightclub ambience around a couple of race scenes, replete with ladies makin out, might as well be cut-and-pasted from Grand Theft Auto . And the homogenized complexion, hair, and features of Jordana Brewster , as Doms sister and hideout confidante, might as well be computer-generated. (Not that the stunts necessarily need the Tarantino Death Proof   treatment: The feverish rainstorm pursuit in We Own the Night   was famously software-augmented.)
All of which subverts the early praise for the series as journeyman genre work. Director Justin Lin , who also chaperoned the last installment, here probes the significant thrills of outrunning or outwitting a flying burning chassis (though a preview audience seemed just as excited by the reappearance of reggaeton stars Tego Calderón  and Don Omar  in subtitled bit parts). Unlike in Tokyo Drift , Lin doesnt dig into his locations enough (though, hurray, Bendix  sign!), and seems to be at that awkward stage where he believes that what a Vin Diesel actioner needs is more lugubrious dialogue. Doms regretful flirtation with Camposs assistant (he likes a lady whos 20 percent angel, 80 percent devil, down-to-earth . . .) and other interludes are DOA, and once OConner has actually broken the nose of his jerkwad FBI  co-worker, scenes at the Union Station size department are likewise deadweight.
A movie whose second spoken line of dialogue is, candidly, Lets make some money at least ends with a satisfyingly ludicrous desert pile-on, with (wholly unnecessary) provisions for a sequel. But whether you blame the Part Four blues, the Dom-OConner stalemate, or Diesels distraction by the prospect of starring in and making a video game of Carthaginian general Hannibal, Fast & Furious   reconfirms that car-chase moviesgood, bad, or mediocreall assume the future employment of the quaint old fast-forward button.
