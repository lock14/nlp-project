         Abyzantine doomsday freakout that also somehow feels eerily familiar, "Southland Tales" is Richard Kelly's panoptic denunciation (or sendup, it's hard to tell) of the imminent, oil crisis-fueled apocalypse as seen from Los Angeles. The movie was booed at Cannes when it screened there last year, though I don't know what that says about it beyond noting that it joins the ranks of Sofia Coppola's "Marie Antoinette," Vincent Gallo's "The Brown Bunny" and Pamela Anderson. Since Cannes, "Southland Tales" has been extensively re-cut -- though, at 2 hours and 24 whacked-out minutes, it's hard to imagine what it looked like before.
 
 The director's second film after the cult hit "Donnie Darko," his new movie is even more logic-resistant than his first, though hopefully it's not quite as prescient. (The September 2001 release of "Donnie Darko" was delayed because of its inopportune imagery of a commercial airliner fuselage falling out of the sky.) The scariest -- and best -- moment in "Southland" takes place before the credits, during a scene at a children's birthday party in Abilene, Texas, where a passed-around video camera happens to record the detonation of an atomic bomb smuggled across the Mexican-American border by members of Al Qaeda.
 


         






   From here, we get the rundown on the three years leading up to 2008: World War III has begun, the draft has been reinstated, access to oil is limited, there are no alternative fuel programs in place, the Patriot Act has been expanded to place all of cyberspace under federal control, and the 2008 presidential election will be decided entirely by California's electoral votes. Meanwhile, in celebrity news, top action star Boxer Santaros (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson) -- husband of Madeline Frost Santaros (Mandy Moore), whose father, Sen. Bobby Frost (Holmes Osborne), is the current Republican vice presidential candidate -- disappears into the desert and reappears a short time later with amnesia and an entrepreneurial porn star girlfriend named Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Gellar) with whom he's written a doomsday screenplay.
 
 What happened to Boxer  and who's responsible? It's apparent that someone, somewhere has cooked up a plot of some kind, but that could be almost anyone. In the three days leading up to the third anniversary of the attacks on Abilene, local neo-Marxist guerrillas from Venice Beach (mostly actors, documentary filmmakers, porn directors and slam poets who oppose total federal control of cyberspace) scheme to blackmail Boxer's  powerful family.
 
 Baron von Westphalen (Wallace Shawn), an insane, autocratic German scientist with dreams of world domination, introduces a new alternative source of energy that draws power from the ocean called Fluid Karma, which also happens to be a hallucinogen he tested on American soldiers in Iraq.
 
 There's a racist cop played by Jon Lovitz; revolutionaries played by Cheri Oteri and Amy Poehler; an Iraq war vet turned cop in search of his missing twin, both played by Seann William Scott; and a Jesus freak, dope fiend, movie star Iraq war vet played by Justin Timberlake, who also serves as narrator.
 
 Whereas the loopy but foreboding tone of "Donnie Darko" made up for what the movie lacked in narrative coherence, the tone of "Southland Tales" is as hard to pin down as the plot. And the point isn't too easy to locate, either. That's not to say that Kelly doesn't have one. It's just that he has more than he knows what to do with.
 
 A long, angry, often incoherent and occasionally brilliant yawp at the state of the world (which sometimes calls to mind an epic ramble by a drunken conspiracy theorist), the movie cloaks its outrage in nihilistic irony and layers and layers of allusion.
 
 "Repo Man," "Kiss Me Deadly," the collected works of Philip K. Dick and the oeuvr
es
 of David Lynch and Kurt Vonnegut are an intrinsic part of the fabric of the movie, which contains screenplays, setups and hallucinations, which are further complicated by the fact that the movie is peopled by actors, twins, addicts, politicians and fanatics.
 
 From one moment to the next, "Southland Tales" is a political farce, a noir doomsday chiller, a paranoid fantasy, a "Saturday Night Live" sketch on acid, a musical and an Alex Cox punk rock reverie. The central narrative, if I followed it, mostly concerns the 2008 election, which is in the pocket of the Republican ticket -- the poetically named presidential candidate Eliot (as in "this is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends") and his running mate Frost -- who, in turn, are aligned with the big, weird, German alterna-fuel. Kelly inverts the presidential candidate's poet-namesake's prediction, saying that the world will end "not with a whimper, but with a bang." But that bang won't come from anything nearly as prosaic as another nuclear attack. It will involve a rift in the space-time continuum and a flying ice cream truck.
 
 As the plot becomes more convoluted and the movie goes haywire, what saves it are its sardonic details. Krysta, a modern porn star, plans to release a single, host a reality show, develop a clothing line and launch a fragrance. A military vehicle is emblazoned with an ad for Hustler magazine. The protagonist of Boxer's screenplay is "Jericho Kane"  -- a name similar to Arnold Schwarzenegger's character in "End of Days."
 
 Kelly must have had Karl Marx's remark -- that "history repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce" -- in mind while writing because "Southland Tales" takes reality as far into absurdity as it will go without ever crossing the line into comedy. If it had, it might have been as effective as Mike Judge's brilliant, buried "Idiocracy." You get the sense that Kelly is too angry to really find any of it funny. It's easy to empathize with his position, not so easy to remain engrossed in a film that's occasionally inspired but ultimately manic and scattered.
 

 
 "Southland Tales." MPAA rating: R for language, violence, sexual material and some drug use. Running time: 2 hours and 24 minutes. In wide release.
   

When Southland Tales , Richard Kelly's apocalyptic futureshock age-of-terror satire, played at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival, it received such an unholy critical drubbing that the bad reviews actually made me want to see it. (So did the egghead minority who hailed it as a masterpiece.) The movie, which begins with a nuclear attack on Abilene, TX, is set in a rancid, paranoid-crackdown America where porn, news, reality TV, and music videos have merged into an omnipresent media glob; where the Internet has become a fascist tool of corporate/government control; and where the Venice Beach party culture remains  big laugh!  more or less the same. Familiar stars keep popping up in bizarro-world roles, like Jon Lovitz as a brutal cop, Seann William Scott as a man who may be the Messiah, and Dwayne Johnson as an amnesiac who twiddles his fingers with anxiety. It sounds like the brainiac Idiocracy , and pretty much is, except that Kelly, in his first feature since Donnie Darko , is also working in the visionary scorched-earth mode of William Burroughs, Don DeLillo, and Infinite Jest. Southland Tales  has a mood unlike anything I've seen: dread that morphs into kitsch and then back again. It's a film that tried my patience, and one I couldn't shake off.


 “Southland Tales,” Richard Kelly’s funny, audacious, messy and feverishly inspired look at America and its discontents, opens with the very biggest of bangs. The place is Texas, the time is 2005, and a crowd of laughing men, women and children are celebrating the Fourth of July when a mushroom cloud blooms in the sky, igniting World War III. Not long after the smoke clears, Justin Timberlake, playing an Iraq war veteran with a thing for quoting Revelation,  ominously intones in voice-over:  “This is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends, this is the way the world ends, not with a whimper but with a bang.”  The lines are borrowed from T. S. Eliot’s post-World War I poem “The Hollow Men” and reverberate through “Southland Tales,” which satirically imagines a wartime landscape unsettlingly close to a modern pessimist’s vision of the day after next. Mr. Kelly has purposely distorted Eliot’s poem, which ends with the whimper, not the bang, and speaks to a ravaged Europe. Now  the wasteland is America, where, in the wake of nuclear attack, the Bud Light still flows freely (par-tee!), though not the fossil fuel. Having reinstated the draft to stock its war fronts — in Iraq and Afghanistan, along with Iran, Syria and North Korea — America has gone into lockdown. Somewhere in Venice, Calif., the revolution tick, tick, ticks.  After the big-bang prologue, the story shifts to 2008, when on the eve of a presidential campaign competing interests are jockeying violently for power. Among the sprawling cast of unusual suspects are the “neo-Marxists,” mostly middle-age hippie chicks swinging Tasers and heavy rhetoric; a Republican presidential candidate and his Lady Macbeth of a wife; and a gaggle of totally awesome porn stars in hot pants and lip gloss who preach their own brand of liberation theology on cable television. Skulking on the sidelines is a mystery man with a spit curl who claims to have found a solution to America’s depleted reserves in something called Fluid Karma, which will light up the country by harnessing the ocean’s power.  There’s more stuffed in Mr. Kelly’s crowded fun house, including the linchpin figure, Boxer Santaros, played with lilting delicacy by Dwayne Johnson. After having gone inexplicably missing, Boxer — identified as an actor with ties to the Republican Party — has re-emerged on the grid in Venice, amnesiac and nestled in the arms of an entrepreneurial porn star, Krysta Now, given dignity and melancholic soul by a lovely Sarah Michelle Gellar.  Together, Boxer and Krysta (she’s all about now, not later) have written an apocalyptic screenplay that they’re trying to pitch amid the intrigue and noise. Everyone wants a part of Boxer, but all he wants to do is research his role, which he does by riding shotgun with a mysterious cop (Seann William Scott, terrific).  What is “Southland Tales”? It’s a romp, for starters, a genre pastiche, a blast of conscience. It’s also overly plotted and at once too long and too short. It took Stanley Kubrick 102 tidy minutes to blow the world to Kingdom Come in “Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb,” one of Mr. Kelly’s touchstones. (His other influences: “Kiss Me Deadly,” “Double Indemnity,” David Lynch, Fox News, comic books, video games, “Saturday Night Live,” years spent living in Los Angeles.) By contrast, “Southland Tales” clocks in at 2 hours 24 minutes. It sounds padded, but I miss the 19 minutes shorn from it in the aftermath of its disastrous premiere at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival.  Being booed at Cannes can be a rite of passage or merely ritualistic, and it’s neither a novel occurrence nor especially notable: Sofia Coppola was booed, as were Antonioni and Bresson. Even so, the critical reaction to “Southland Tales” was harsh and in some instances as ugly as it can get when the wolf pack starts to circle, with one critic actually wondering if its director had ever met another human being. Since then, Mr. Kelly has streamlined the narrative, excising characters and plot threads (blink and you’ll miss a trace of Janeane Garofalo’s  redacted performance), added some nifty special effects and secured domestic distribution. The film still sprawls, at times beautifully, at times maddeningly, but its ambition and pleasures remain undiminished.  American cinema is in the grip of a kind of moribund academicism, which helps explain why a fastidiously polished film like “No Country for Old Men” can receive such  gushing  praise from critics. “Southland Tales” isn’t as smooth  and tightly tuned as “No Country,” a film I admire with few reservations. Even so, I would rather watch a young filmmaker like Mr. Kelly reach beyond the obvious, push past his and the audience’s comfort zones, than follow the example of the Coens and elegantly art-direct yet one more murder for your viewing pleasure and mine. Certainly “Southland Tales” has more ideas, visual and intellectual, in a single scene than most American independent films have in their entirety, though that perhaps goes without saying.  Neither disaster nor masterpiece, “Southland Tales” again confirms that Mr. Kelly, who made a startling feature debut with “Donnie Darko,” is one of the bright lights of his filmmaking generation. He doesn’t make it easy to love his new film, which turns and twists and at times threatens to disappear down the rabbit hole of his obsessions. Happily, it never does, which allows you to share in his unabashed joy in filmmaking as well as in his fury about the times. Only an American who loves his country as much as Mr. Kelly does could blow it to smithereens and then piece it together with help from the Rock, Buffy, Mr. Timberlake and a clutch of professional wisenheimers. He does want to give peace a chance, seriously.  “Southland Tales” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Adult language and gun violence.
Rarely has a picture been so self-consciously designed to be a culturally meaningful touchstone, and fallen so woefully short, as "Southland Tales." A pretentious, overreaching, fatally unfocused fantasy about American fascism, radical rebellion, nuclear terrorism and apocalypse set two years hence, sprawling pic boasts 10 producers, clearly none of them strong enough to rein in the overweening indulgences of second-time director Richard Kelly, coming off the promising indie fave "Donnie Darko." Without a firm U.S. distrib -- despite having been co-financed by Universal, which is handling it in numerous foreign territories -- this wannabe visionary epic may find cult believers among gullible undergrads ready to embrace anything that projects the worst paranoid notions about America. But the fiasco at hand will be evident to everyone else, making commercial prospects exceedingly dicey.
Divided into "chapters" IV, V and VI, just like "Star Wars," to follow up the current publication of books I, II and III as graphic novels, the film trades on post-9/11 anxieties by conjuring up a near-future when, to spin T.S. Eliot, the world ends not with a whimper but with a bang.
Dirty bombs, a federalized police force, energy scarcity, the Iraq war, occupation of Syria and a global warming-spurred heat wave are among the issues in the 2008 election in which the ruling party faces opposition not so much from any unnamed party but from a "neo-Marxist" underground with California h.q. in the beach communities south of Santa Monica.
A July 4, 2005-set prologue conjures up a nuclear attack in Texas. Three years later, the heavy hand of government is everywhere, with the adjunct of some Germans who have come up with a "tidal generator" that uses waves as an alternate energy source to scarce gasoline.
But when it begins introducing what eventually becomes a telephone book-sized cast of characters, several of whom have multiple identities or aliases, Kelly's script begins fracturing irreparably, losing coherence before it has ever achieved any. Sooner rather than later, you give up trying to try to make sense of anything, which brands the picture as a lost cause.
Among the individuals one is forced to scrutinize for long periods are Boxer Santaros (Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson), an actor trying to pitch a script called "The Power" who assumes the fictional identity of his scenario's character Jericho Cane and has sporadic amnesia that makes him nervously tap his fingers; Krysta (Sarah Michelle Gellar), a porn star who's launching a new career as a TV pundit devoted to such topics as teen horniness, and Roland Taverner (Seann William Scott), a beach cop with a missing twin.
Meaningless scene after meaningless scene spins off as if from a fly-wheel. The ruling class occupies a high-tech domain dominated by security and spotless environs and populated by creatures that look either primly evil, such as Miranda Richardson's all-seeing chieftess, or clown-like (Wallace Shawn, Zelda Rubinstein) -- like figures out of "Fellini Satyricon."
The guerrillas and assorted low-life, too many of whom resemble porn world denizens or grade-B actors, live in a graffiti-and-clutter-strewn environment well on its way to a "Mad Max" sort of primitive chic, but one that is truly ugly to behold.
Kelly tries for arch comedy along with grandiose stylistic flourishes, but strikes out entirely on the first count and merely exposes his shortcomings on the second. Director acknowledges such detectable influences as "Blade Runner," "Brazil," Phillip K. Dick and Kurt Vonnegut, and a clip of Robert Aldrich's L.A. noir "Kiss Me Deadly" makes explicit the apocalyptic inspiration it provided more than 50 years ago.
But the short-term speculative fiction work "Southland Tales" most resembles is Kathryn Bigelow's "Strange Days," especially with their holiday-set downtown Los Angeles finales.
With the surfeit of characters on hand, there is not one the viewer can latch onto as a guide through the impenetrable thicket of undeveloped story strands, nor one who supplies even an ounce of recognizable humanity; dialogue is all platitudes, pronouncements and one-upsmanship, without any natural conversional element. Far too many ideas and potential plot seeds are planted than can ever be properly cultivated, and the whole thing feels like something that could only be thought up, or considered profound, in an altered state accompanied by a fever dream.
What's a shame is that there was no one involved on the project who could give Kelly brutally honest advice about the mess in the kitchen before the dish was served -- who could save him from himself. It's the sophomore jinx with a vengeance.

A doom-ridden pulp cabalist with a dark sense of purpose as well as humor, Richard Kelly  shoots the moon with his rich, strange, and very funny sci-fi social satire, Southland Tales .
Kelly's debut, Donnie Darko  , was the first post-millennial cult hit; his second feature, opening here next Wednesday, achieved film  maudit  status long before the credits rolled during its disastrous press screening at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival . (Kelly might have lost half the audience two minutes in by simply quoting T.S. Eliot 's sonorous "This is the way the world ends . . . " in the context of a suburban barbecue.) Southland Tales  recognizes the protocols of the National Entertainment State, but, flirting with sensory overload and predicated on a familiarity with American TV, political rhetoric, and religious cant, it's a movie without a recognizable genre or ready-made demographic. The French hated it (some things don't travel); so did the Americans (too much information can breed resentment).
Kelly's fever dream premiered at two hours and 45 minutes; now trimmed by 20 minutesdropping subplots and adding voice-overit remains a gloriously sprawling and enjoyably unsynopsizeable spectacle. (Indeed, as demonstrated by the Donnie Darko  director's cut, Kelly is actually better when his cosmology remains obscure.) Fictions breed and conspiracies multiply, alternately over- and under- explicated by cartoonish characters speaking in agitated tele-clichés. Every aspect of the convoluted narrative is monitored, scripted, and directed from within the movie. Half the characters are watching the other half. The news cycle spins merrily out of control, producing something that Kelly is pleased to term a rift in the space-time continuum.
Where Donnie Darko , which opened in New York just before Halloween 2001, uncannily anticipated the city's post 9/11 mood, Southland Tales  sets out to evoke what Borat Sagdiyev  called Bush's War of Terror. The political phantasmagoria unfoldsmainly around Venice Beach  and the Santa Monica  pierin an alternately pre- and post-apocalyptic universe in which Abilene , Texas, was nuked on July 5, 2005. Since then, oil prices have spiked and an absurd German multinational has figured out how to produce energyalong with a new psychedelic drugfrom the ocean. The draft is back; war has spread to Syria . Cops stand watch offshore, their RPGs trained on the beach. Thanks to the Patriot Act , cyberspace is under government control, leased to a corporation called USIdent. Plus, it's an election year. The Republicans  have nominated the poetic team of Eliot and Frost; in a throwaway gag, it's noted that the Democrats are running Clinton and Lieberman. Local terrorists have a fish bowl of severed thumbs used to manufacture bogus votes.
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson  heads the large (large) cast playing an anxious, amnesiac celebrity, action-hero Boxer Santaros, with diminutive vampire-slayer Sarah Michelle Gellar  as the socially conscious porn queen Krysta Now. From this unlikely material, Kelly contrives two memorable comic performancesand even a convincing tabloid love story. Fingers nervously aflutter, the Rock projects a poignant blanknesshe's always trying to comprehend. Gellar, by contrast, is a briskly determined, humorless firebrand. "All the pilgrims did was ruin the Indian orgy of freedom," she snaps to a sex-star-posse roundtable during the course of her View -like "topical discussion chat-reality show."
Southland Tales  begins in media res, bombarding the audience with chunks of backstory. Having been abducted and brainwashed, no longer remembering his marriage to Madeline Frost  (a superbly petulant Mandy Moore ), the daughter of Republican VP candidate Bobby Frost  (Donnie Darko's dad, Holmes Osborne ), Santaros is shacked up with Krysta. Together they've written a screenplay titled The Power  that, among other things, serves to program the dithering hero. Rival blackmailersa self-described "international documentary filmmaker" (Nora Dunn ) and a volatile lefty (Cheri Oteri )strive to exploit the Santaros-Now liaison as a means to intervene in the election, variously employing a troubled cop whose twin brother is an Iraq  veteran (both Seann William Scott ) and a slam poet (Amy Poehler ) who boasts that "all your regulation can't stop this masturbation." The secret controllers, however, are the Baron von Westphalen  (grotty gargoyle Wallace Shawn ), inventor of alternative energy Liquid Karma, and Mrs. Bobby Frost (Miranda Richardson , dressed as if to perform in The Rocky Horror Picture Show ).
Retooling the Book of Revelations for cable, Southland Tales  is a mishmash of literary citations, TV texts, pop music, and movie references. Kelly recruits much of his cast from Saturday Night Live  . The specter of Karl Marx  surfaces in various guises, including as the namesake for the last remnant of the Democratic Party. So do refugees from the world of David Lynch . Ads disrupt the flow. In one, a pair of SUVs mate; in another, an irate householder asks, "Do you think your personal privacy is worth more than my family's safety from terrorist attack?" Music videos insinuate themselves into the flux, most elaborately when an artfully scarred Fallujah  survivor (Justin Timberlake ) lip-syncs the Killer's "All These Things That I've Done" in a pinball arcade populated by a chorus line of vinyl-clad babes.
Clearly, this all makes sense to Kelly, who generously invites you to go with the flow. Even as the narrative arc turns to scribble-scrabble, everything does come together as the surviving characters converge at the launch party for the Baron's new dirigible. An earthquake erupts. Riots break out. It's just like Titanic , except Rebekah Del Rio is singing the national anthem, solemn little Krysta is previewing her new video, and a levitating ice-cream truck serves as the fatal iceberg.
