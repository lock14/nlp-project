n "� Tout de Suite," Beno�t Jacquot's deft homage to the French New Wave, the radiant young actress Isild Le Besco plays Lili, a 19-year-old Parisian art student who plunges recklessly into an affair with Bada (Ouassini Embarek), a Moroccan-French bank robber she meets in a bar and takes home for sex that very night. It is 1975, and the song that unites them on the floor of a seedy dance club is Diana Ross's syrupy theme song from "Mahogany." A day or two later, after a botched hold-up that leaves two people dead, Bada calls Lili from the scene of the crime (being covered live on television) to say goodbye. She promises that if he makes a successful getaway, he can spend the night in her family's spacious apartment, so roomy that friends and lovers can easily slip in and out without detection. Minutes later, Bada and his accomplice appear at the back door. The next morning, Lili flees with them without leaving a note, eventually traveling from Spain to Morocco to Greece, where the glamour of being a "bandette," her rose-colored term for moll, quickly evaporates. Abandoned in Athens, she is reduced to relying on the kindness of strangers who offer help, usually with strings attached. Bada is almost as na�ve as Lili. A scrawny, soulful hood, this adored only child of Moroccan immigrants who run a barbershop has illusions of being Robin Hood. Those fantasies are dashed by the guilty knowledge that he has killed another human being and is wanted for murder. Ms. Le Besco radiates the gawky sensuality of a headstrong adolescent masking her fears (and horsy teeth) under an enigmatic pout. The character is the same kind of overeager initiate as Emilie, the sexually curious teenager she played in Mr. Jacquot's costume drama "Sade" (as in Marquis de Sade). Both characters lunge into experience without considering the consequences. As Lili's life unravels, the clueless comments in her voice-over narration reinforce the impression of an unformed creature whose destiny will be determined by her mistakes. The downbeat story unfolds in quick, incisive slashes in which the combination of minimal dialogue and gorgeous black-and-white photography lends the movie a chilly documentary realism. This small, nearly perfect film is really about the sad chains of events that can follow when people foolishly surrender to their dumbest romantic impulses.
Isild Le Besco , the young star of Benoît Jacquot 's Tout de Suite , has the face of someone woken from a thousand-year slumber. Her lids are heavy; her brow is impossibly smooth. With her serene ovoid face and tragic curving mouth, Le Besco would have made a sensational cubist model.
In Tout de Suite , adapted from Elisabeth Fanger 's memoir When I Was 19 , Le Besco plays a character at once passive and daring. The title can be translated as "Right Now," but shot in luminous black-and-white, the movie is set in the mid '70s. Le Besco's Lili is a bored, mildly wanton rich girla 19-year-old art student living in her father's labyrinthine Paris apartment. She goes out dancing in a Belleville  dive and falls madly in love with a cherubic-looking Moroccan boy. Innocent as he appears, Bada (Ouassini Embarek) turns out to be a petty criminal; a few nights later, he calls Lili from a botched bank job, replete with hostages and casualties. She shelters him and his surviving confederate, taking it happily on the lam, first in Spain, then Morocco , and finally Greece , where her trip takes a more hazardous, discombobulated, and existential turn.
Lili is more expressive than articulate; not surprisingly for Jacquot, who made his reputation largely as a director of stylish young women in the act of self-actualization, the movie revolves around Le Besco's Picasso -mask visage. Less a tale of desperado lovers than a cruel story of youth, Tout de Suite  is framed largely in close-up, with few transitional shots and a narrative that grows increasingly fragmented. (The filmmaker occasionally interpolates newsreel clips or interjects his protagonist's voice-over to temper the tale's immediacy.)
Jacquot's most recent moviesincluding Sade , which featured the then teenage Le Besco as a Marquis-smitten ingenuehave been flossy period pieces. Tout de Suite  harks back to the suave and somewhat creepy psychologically fraught trioThe Disenchanted , A Single Girl, Seventh Heaven that he made during the '90s. Like those, it has its fairy-tale aspect; in this case, it's the story of a sleeping beauty roused.
