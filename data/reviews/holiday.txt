If �talking about relationships� is equivalent to �being in love,� this is the most romantic movie ever. You�ll love it. It has a snowy storybook cottage in England with a cute puppy dog and a little red Mini you can drive whimsically on the wrong side of the road, and Jude Law stumbles in drunkenly one night, available for sex but not at all pushy about it. And there�s another part, too, with a villa in Hollywood, where the curmudgeonly and moderately infirm old screenwriter next door (Wallach) will be your empowerment guru and you get to hang out with a cute sort of art guy (Black, in toothless, charming mode) who makes you laugh in the video store until you finally realize you�re made for each other. (He has a girlfriend � that bitch Shannyn Sossamon, who is so
 not to be trusted � but maybe they�ll break up.) Writer/director Meyers� follow-up to Something�s Gotta Give
 mines the same go-girl terrain but is far less interesting narratively, with stock characterizations and a blandly upbeat vibe; with all due respect to the message of cheer inside, the movie is as conventional as a corporate Christmas card. It�s cute enough, but it lacks any sort of spontaneity or surprise. Of course you know there will be a happy ending, but you also know you�ll cut to a roomful of properly matched white people dancing ecstatically to Motown; freed of the crippling inhibitions and self-doubt they have discussed at length in the talky script (�I�m not sure I fall in love. Not like other people do.�), they will do the bump and laugh uproariously, and the camera will trickle backward out of a snowy window. If this is what you want in a movie about love, the most important topic on earth, you will not be disappointed. In any event, it�s hard to find fault with the cast, who do provide much-needed elements of freshness and emotional authenticity. There�s pleasure to be found in Winslet�s transformation from snowbound office drudge to L.A. lady, as when her character unselfconsciously (and somewhat unattractively) belly flops with a running start onto the giant bed in Diaz�s villa. She�s open and accessible and a little geeky. Too bad the script keeps reminding us of her �gumption� instead of allowing it to show. Across the pond, Diaz and Law have all the chemistry Winslet and Black don�t � amazing but true � and while Diaz wrinkles her nose and trips over her luggage, Law entirely sells himself as a good idea, romantically, or at least worth the risk. His is the standout performance, probably because it�s quiet and reflective and nuanced amidst the flurries of relationship talk.


In "The Holiday," Kate Winslet and Cameron Diaz try to cure their man troubles by swapping homes for two weeks in December. Diaz moves into Winslet's rustic English cottage (it look s like a gingerbread house). Winslet gets Diaz's ultramodern Los Angeles manse. On Diaz's first night, this pretty much happens:
Knock-knock.
Who's there?
It's Jude.
Jude who?
Jude better sleep me with now. You've only got two weeks!
That's cheesy, I know, but welcome to the universe of Nancy Meyers, where low-grade cheesiness is contagious. Meyers may not be a household name but the movies she's written and directed are. "Private Benjamin," "Baby Boom," "Father of the Bride," "What Women Want," "Something's Gotta Give" -- they're the commercial equivalent of a pseudo-feminist spa day. Her heroines walk in bedraggled and emerge fabulous, having undergone nothing more taxing than two hours of intensely mediocre filmmaking.
"The Holiday" is Meyers's most bearable romantic comedy, primarily because she's taken a holiday herself from the inept sociology of her last two movies, "What Women Want" and "Something's Gotta Give." The new movie simply insists that your heart will warm -- even if Meyers has to put it in the microwave. Hence a sweet scene in which Winslet, accepting a corsage, says, "I like corny. I'm looking for more corny in my life."
Along those lines: Of course
 if Cameron Diaz opens a door, the stranger standing on the other side is Jude Law, looking typically scrumptious. He plays Winslet's brother, who's drunk the night he and Diaz meet and is willing to let her take him to bed -- his sister's. As the days pass, it turns out he's not perfect. He's better.
While Diaz and Law heat up, Winslet mends her busted heart by caring for Eli Wallach, as the 90-year-old legendary screenwriter down the road, and spending time with Jack Black, playing a friend of Diaz's ex. The devilment gone from his grin and sporting a great haircut, Black composes movie scores, and there's a nice scene in which he acts out famous themes for Winslet in a video store.
Meyers can't sustain a convincing idea in her movies, whether it's a look at advertising to female consumers ("What Women Want") or the vicissitudes of a middle-aged woman's sex life ("Something's Gotta Give"). But to her credit, the people in them are often a pleasure to watch, even Diaz, whose untamed party-girl flailing conceals latent womanliness, at least when she's lying on her back contemplating the manmade stars on the roof of a tent.
"The Holiday" is a lark, with pretensions to be more. Diaz owns a company that makes movie trailers, a job that Meyers uses as an attempt to mock Hollywood witlessness. (Diaz's inner thoughts are narrated by the booming voice of American movie previews.) At one point, Wallach tells Winslet she's a leading lady who ought to stop acting like the best friend. He then prescribes for her a diet of Irene Dunne, Rosalind Russell, and Barbara Stanwyck , which she follows.
Those women had "gumption," he says. What's Meyers' excuse?
Charismatic as her heroines are, they lack nerve. Meyers seems to think gumption is in a jar at the Smithsonian. Rather than create her own dames, she nostalgically pays tribute to a bygone era as if coming up with tougher, more interesting women were someone else's job. Those stars didn't own gumption; neither did Preston Sturges, Ernst Lubitsch, Ben Hecht, Howard Hawks , or the other writers and directors who put them front and center.
We don't need more eulogies for cracklingly smart romantic comedies. We need more talented people to bring better corny back into our lives.


         The alluring surfaces of other people's lives can be deceiving, though generally not in a Nancy Meyers comedy, where the thin veneer of fantasy cloaks ... more fantasy. "The Holiday" is the story of two single women who swap houses over Christmas and, because they're nice girls, wind up with the boyfriends they deserve. If you wrapped Jude Law in a bow and tucked Jack Black into a stocking with a leather bone, it couldn't be cozier or more Christmasy.
 
  Kate Winslet, who — and this seems to settle it — can do no wrong, plays Iris Simpkins, an alternate version of what Bridget Jones might have been had she been allowed to retain a shred of her Englishness and dignity. Even so, Iris is a doormat, desperately hung up on her ex-boyfriend, Jasper (Rufus Sewell), who dumped her three years ago but continues to string her along like a deflated helium balloon. When Jasper announces his engagement to another woman, Iris troops back to her cottage, briefly and comically considers suicide, and is saved by a message from Amanda (Cameron Diaz), a Los Angeles workaholic who has come across Iris' cottage on a home exchange website.
 


         






    Amanda is the other girl meat. Successful, stressed to the gills, dauntingly self-sufficient, her quirk is that she can't cry, which means she can't feel
, which means her live-in boyfriend (briefly played by Ed Burns) has been driven into the arms of a much younger and presumably more lachrymose receptionist. Diaz knows the type — she's seen her in the movies — and she delivers her lines in a cursory rat-a-tat-tat that gives the impression she somehow knows how she's going to respond to things before they happen.
 
  So Iris decamps for Los Angeles and Amanda goes to Surrey, where Iris has neglected to mention she has an outrageously attractive, bookish, sensitive and saintly older brother named Graham (Jude Law) who is prone to dropping by her cottage in the middle of the night. Why not? The house exchange confirms our most improbable visions of how the other side of the pond lives — it's as though Nora Ephron had swapped houses with Merchant-Ivory or Jackie Collins with Mother Goose. When a wedding announcements writer for a newspaper lives alone in a snow-dusted, storybook cottage at the end of a country lane and a movie trailer editor lives in a multimillion dollar faux-cienda in Brentwood, you have to wonder what else you should be skeptical about. Could Law's character turn out to be an ax murderer? Well, no. But that's not what you paid for.
 
  Graham shows up drunk at the door of the cottage on Amanda's first night in England. (It sounds like a Canterbury Tale, but instead of mistaking each other for the golden retriever under the covers, the couple negotiate their way into bed.) Amanda takes him for a womanizing party boy. As do we — it's hard to strike all that tabloid juice from the record just because the lights are dimmed.
 
  Meanwhile, back in Amanda's luxurious pad, Iris' lust is initially reserved for the interiors. Soon afterward, she meets Arthur (Eli Wallach), a legendary screenwriter in his 90s who introduces her to the concept of "meet cute." As Arthur schools her in the ways of classic screwball comedies, he gently nudges her in the direction of Miles (Jack Black), a film composer and the business partner of Amanda's ex, who like Iris can't resist a toxic love.
 
  Like a magic trick in reverse, "The Holiday" reveals the mechanics of the formula while trying to keep up the illusion. By the time Iris meets Miles, she has started to take on some of the characteristics of the romantic comedy heroine, the better to clear her hurdles. It's a testament to Winslet's talents that she can emerge from a door-slamming scene in which she declares she's got "gumption" relatively unscathed.
 
  And Law pulls off the seemingly impossible, remaining credibly sexy and funny as his character is piled with so many beautific attributes you half expect his head to start glowing. Diaz strikes the off-note, but then you tend to think it's not her fault. The character of Amanda is one of those newfangled Hollywood confections that would make Irene Dunne cry; an anxious, pandering combination of tough and perky, bitter but hot. It would have been something to see an Amanda truer to character, someone cool and caustic and intimidatingly out of reach. And it would have been better yet to see Law cleverly dismantle her defenses rather than douse them in treacle. But for that you'd have to go back to the days when Arthur was hot.
 
 
 Rated PG-13 for sexual content and some strong language. 2 hours and 18 minutes. In general release.   

It may not be proof that miracles do happen, but with Something&#39;s Gotta Give    (2003), the writer-director Nancy Meyers took a leap from the processed screwball of movies like her 2000 hit What Women Want    to something zesty and stirring and wittily adult. It's as if Rachael Ray had blossomed into Alice Waters. Now Meyers is back with The Holiday , and I'm sad to report that it's just a cookie-cutter chick flick, albeit one made with some fancy butter and powdered frosting.
Why cookie-cutter? Because of the too self-consciously ''old-fashioned'' Nora Ephron premise: Cameron Diaz and Kate Winslet as neurotic singletons, one a highly stressed Los Angeles editor of movie trailers, the other a deeply tender London newspaper reporter, who agree over the Internet to swap homes for Christmas vacation. Because of the grating, insecurity-lit-up-in-neon way that Diaz overplays the role of a too-organized, high-functioning, no-tears yuppie who keeps imagining her life as a blockbuster trailer of romantic clichés  except that the schlocky fantasy trailer doesn't look all that different from the movie we're watching. Because of the way that Winslet, as a woman devoted to a scoundrel (Rufus Sewell) who doesn't love her, lays on the sub–Bridget Jones dithering until you practically have to squint to believe that a 21st-century woman this  beautiful could be this much of a doormat. And because of how each actress gets one embarrassing rock & roll air-guitar scene. And I haven't even mentioned the men.
Okay, I know that male movie critics aren't allowed to complain that a chick flick is formulaic; it would be like me griping that the latest issue of Cosmo  includes too many Wild Lovemaking Positions You've Never Seen Before. Yet I now officially expect more from Nancy Meyers. There's no denying her facility, though. The dialogue has a perky synthetic sheen, and with the exception of Diaz, Meyers brings out the best in her actors  Winslet, her sexy vulnerability aglow; Jack Black, as the film-score composer who woos her, dialing down his mad energy to reveal the sweetness beneath; and Jude Law, as Diaz's suitor, too chivalrous to resist as a man too good to be true. So eat up, chick-flickaholics! Even if you know it's not good for you.

 The director Nancy Meyers gets a kick out of romantic love, but she also grooves to its agonies, particularly those of the more prolix kind. In her neo-screwball world of dizzy dames and the heartbreakers who do and done them wrong, love is a drug, an escape, an ordeal and a ready excuse for a lot of chatter. The men and women in a Nancy Meyers film don’t just fall in love; they talk about falling in love, about falling out of love, about needing, fearing and surrendering to love. They would, I imagine, have driven Raymond Carver crazy.  Ms. Meyers can also drive her fans crazy, largely because her ravenous need to please the audience sometimes gets in the way of her talent. In the fizzy “Something’s Gotta Give,” a romantic comedy that holds up to repeat viewings, even on airplanes, where it nicely fills the small screen, this eagerness dovetails beautifully with Diane Keaton’s fidgety performance as a woman stunned by new love. (And with Jack Nicholson, no less.) The underlying anxiousness of the filmmaking, the almost obsessive reliance on patter and pratfalls, and even the neurotic tastefulness of the costumes and sets (every outfit is just right, every bibelot just so) find a perfect corollary in each of Ms. Keaton’s artful, becoming twitches and blushes.  There are similar currents of unease in “The Holiday,” most generated by Iris, a lovesick English rose played by Kate Winslet, and by the wobbliness of the narrative framework. Employed by The Daily Telegraph in London, where she has improbably scored an office for writing the wedding column, Iris is in love with Jasper (Rufus Sewell). She has also committed to an unfortunate type of romantic masochism because while he’s the flame, these days she’s only the keeper.  Though he now makes time with a twiggy brunette (as Iris cries into her computer), the exes nonetheless come across as cozy as old slippers. It’s not clear if the relationship was ever consummated, but it has puttered along for years, fired by her desire and fanned by his need for her adoration.  Ms. Winslet is always a welcome screen presence, and if this were the story of how Iris eventually chucked Jasper aside for someone worthier, say, like Hugh Grant in “Love Actually” or the dodgier (if sexier) Hugh Grant of the Bridget Jones comedies, it might be easier to fall for “The Holiday.” But Ms. Meyers, whose ambitions are telegraphed by her film’s title, which directly invokes George Cukor’s lovely 1938 romp “Holiday,” has created a cumbersome vehicle by saddling Iris with a flamboyantly glamorous Los Angeles double, Amanda. As played by Cameron Diaz with oodles of charm and not an ounce of persuasion, Amanda doesn’t as much mirror Iris’s love troubles as throw them into wincing relief.  On the brink of Christmas, these two strangers trade homes for the holidays and land smack in each other’s lifestyles. Amanda ends up in a sweet country cottage that looks as if it has been drawn by Beatrix Potter, while Iris moves into a Los Angeles mansion with a maid and a pool large enough for the Olympics. There is a huge Robert Longo  hanging over the staircase and a flat-screen TV on which Iris delights in Hollywood treasures with Barbara Stanwyck that Ms. Meyers fires up like beacons. In case Iris or anyone else misses the point, there is also a sweet-and-sour old-studio screenwriter (a sly Eli Wallach) who waxes indignant about what has happened to the movies while his dusty Oscar stands watch.  “The Holiday” is a tale of two women, two houses, two love interests — Jude Law pairs with Ms. Diaz, Jack Black gets lucky with Ms. Winslet — but it’s also about movie love. There is something touching if willfully naïve about Ms. Meyers’s nostalgia for Hollywood’s golden age, when Louis B. Mayer ruled the very lot on which she shot part of this film. If her name had been Ned, not Nancy, she might have thrived then. She wouldn’t have been allowed to go amusingly (or maddeningly) off point, but her commercial instincts would have been encouraged, her indulgences — like filling mouths with speeches, not dialogue — squelched. An old-studio producer would have recognized that there are several films jammed into this one and maybe called in Ben Hecht for a polish, even as he recognized that Ms. Meyers always has something to give.  “The Holiday” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It includes some adult language and suggestions of lovemaking.
From its wink-wink, nudge- nudge movie-within-a-movie opening through to its bald-faced quoting of such classic Hollywood  farces as The Lady Eve and His Girl Friday , Nancy Meyers 's The Holiday  wants us to know that it's different from the kind of rom-com pablum that fills the multiplexes these days. And it is different; it's a special kind of pablumpablum for the cognoscenti. Like Meyers's last two chick-flick hits, What Women Want and Something's Gotta Give , this is a high-gloss romp about beautiful, obscenely successful people who are less lucky in love than they are in their careers, but who believe they deserve to have it all and, before the picture's over, end up getting it. And because Meyers keeps elbowing the audience in the ribs as if to say, "I know it looks like I'm recycling a bunch of hoary old clichés, but I'm really poking fun at them," a lot of viewers will leave with the impression that they've just seen something smart and sophisticated. Like her near namesake, Meyers has quite a way with B-O-L-O-G-N-A.
Set between Los Angeles and London during the last weeks of the calendar year, The Holiday is about two women who share the need for a change of scenery. In SoCal, movie trailer producer Amanda (Cameron Diaz ), has just kicked her no-good cheating boyfriend to the curb. Across the pond, Daily Telegraph wedding reporter Iris (Kate Winslet ) has discovered that her own unfaithful ex, whom she still not-so-secretly pines for, is getting hitched to another woman. Lo and behold, these two inconsolable lonely hearts stumble upon one another in an Internet chat room, bond over their mutual hatred for the male species, and promptly negotiate a house swap: Amanda's epic Brentwood  mansion for Iris's quaint gingerbread cottage.
Meyers, whose films have collectively grossed more than $1 billion worldwide, is probably the most quantifiably successful woman filmmaker in Hollywood at the moment, and beyond her impressive ticket sales, she's garnered a reputation for crafting the kind of empowered female characters that women are always complaining there aren't enough of in the movies. But with the notable exception of Private Benjamin , her films strike me as retrograde toward the fairer sex in ways that would get a male director strung up by his toes. In What Women Want , for example, when Mel Gibson 's cock-of-the-walk adman is gifted with the ability to hear women's innermost thoughts, the things he hears only reinforce every stereotype that preening chauvinists already have about women: that there's nothing wrong with them that a little sweet talk and a roll in the hay won't cure. Then, in Something's Gotta Give , Meyers offers up Diane Keaton  as the supposed epitome of independent-minded modern womanhood, only to reveal her as a man-hungry pushover ready to fall into the arms of anyone who still finds her attractive.
Now, in The Holiday , Meyers gives us two younger women who swear off men, sit around blaming themselves for romantic failings, and at the earliest opportunity, dive headfirst back into the relationship cesspool. When Iris's studly brother Graham (the ubiquitous Jude Law ) shows up unannounced (and drunk) on Amanda's doorstep not 24 hours after her arrival, she beds down with him posthaste. Meanwhile, Iris wastes little time in striking up more than a friendship with self-effacing film composer Miles (Jack Black ), no matter that he's already in a relationship. Somehow, despite Meyers's exaltation of fidelity early in the film, this is supposed to be OK, because, well, Iris and Miles are clearly made for each other.
All of The Holiday 's most graceful moments belong to 91-year-old Eli Wallach  as Amanda's L.A. neighbor, an Oscar-winning screenwriting legend who befriends Iris and tells her she should stop being the wallflowery best friend in the movie of her own life and start acting the part of a leading lady. Would that she listened. For a supposedly strong female character, Iris has less backbone than some species of earthworm; she only values herself as much as the men in her life (and the wrong ones, at that) value her. If this is female empowerment, I'd hate to see what oppression looks like.
Still, the sad truth of The Holiday is that, for much of the time it's up there on the screen, it is smarter than the Hollywood norm, by which I mean pretty much anything starring some combination of Kate Hudson  and one of the Wilson brothers. Meyers can write a good zinger, and she has a knack for casting actors who not only look good in bed, but are talented enough to rise above the material and, in some cases, nearly transform it (save Diaz). But make no mistake: We're a long way here from Ben Hecht  and Preston Sturges . If you really love the smart, golden-age-of-Hollywood romantic comedies as much as Meyers claims that she doesthe ones with the "powerhouse" (to borrow Meyers's own word) women and the crackling wityou'll probably want some Holiday after The Holiday .
