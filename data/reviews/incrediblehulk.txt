Five years after Ang Lee attempted a stylistically and narratively daring reimagining of what a comic-book movie could be (an example that tanked disastrously at the box office), the big green gamma-guy returns to the screen in a purer, more unadulterated, vastly more entertaining form. Ang Lee's big, bigger, biggest screen version of Stan Lee's comic-book character was ambitious to be sure, but its overly expository storyline and unnecessarily Jungian subtext (not to mention Nick Nolte's crazy-brilliant performance and the presence of a giant, killer poodle) rendered it an instant one-shot experiment. Ultimately, it was an honorable attempt but one which, viewed today, just doesn't feel like part of the Marvel Comics multiverse. Leterrier and screenwriter Zak Penn (whose script was, in turn, rewritten by star Edward Norton) is only the second shot in an upcoming fusillade planned by Marvel Studios. Already, The Incredible Hulk
 follows on the repulsor heels of Iron Man
 for the studio's boffo summer 2008 releases, and for all intents and purposes, Stan Lee will also most probably own the next five summer movie seasons. Suddenly, the Hulk feels really, truly incredible. That's thanks to two key aspects of the film: Norton's performance, which recalls, in all the right ways, the peripatetic Samaritan-cum-golem of the televised characterization and the seamless inclusion of brief yet integral snippets of Marvel Comics mythology into the film's main tale. (Many of these, including the blink-and-you'll-miss-it mention of old school Marvel cold warrior Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.
 and the accidental origin of Nelson's sidebar sci-guy character as the future Leader, should be filed under Fanboy Money Shots, but still, they're smart, forward-thinking touches.) But most importantly, Leterrier's film begins with one helluva bang (courtesy of Stark Industries, natch) and, like the Hulk's alter ego, Dr. Bruce Banner, it never stops moving. At the film's core, under its rippling CGI/motion-capture musculature, lies the classic dramatic crucible of unrequited love, unaided and unabetted by the necessity of constant flight and persistent pursuit. Norton's necessarily repressed genius pines for but cannot safely be with his one true love, Betty Ross (Tyler), not only because any uptick in his heartbeat might trigger the beast within, but also because (wouldn't you know it) she's the daughter of scheming military brasshole General "Thunderbolt" Ross (Hurt), who dreams, Mabuse-like, of creating an army of hulking super-soldiers. Hurt gives Ross a genuine streak of humanity beneath all that hardcore hawkishness, but it's clear from the outset that both Ross and Roth's cannily-played character Emil Blonsky (here repurposed from his comic-book incarnation as a KGB agent to an aging British SAS commando with an unslakable thirst for battle) will be antagonists for the duration. All of this will mean nada to audiences who don't go in for comic book-based filmmaking, of course. If you don't know who Tony Stark is or who The Avengers
 might or might not be, you could be better cinematically served by rewatching Peter Parker in Ang Lee's The Ice Storm
. And, too, if you don't care to consider why movies of the Stan Lee stripe may be so singularly freighted with pop-culture import in a world where heroes � super or otherwise � are in increasingly short supply, well pal, you obviously don't know Jack (Kirby). As of right now, it's Marvel's universe. We just live in it.


The movie studio might call him "The Incredible Hulk," but I came to think of him as Jose Canseco with an incredibly swampy tan. When Jose's not barreling through computer-enhanced Brazilian favelas and destroying most of Harlem in the finale of this flavorless contraption, he's sleeping deep down inside a lean, not-as-green Edward Norton. I must say I prefer his steroidal inner self.
Norton joins Robert Downey Jr. as the season's other very good actor time-sharing his part with a crack special-effects department. In "Iron Man," Downey appeared to be having a flamboyantly good time. Norton is a drag. This is partly a matter of necessity. Lest he hulk out, Norton's character, Dr. Bruce Banner, must keep his heart rate low. The movie tallies for us Bruce's "days without incident" (158 when we meet him) and follows him miserably on the run from the government.
This is all explained in a nifty, wordless opening sequence. The gist of what follows is that General "Thunderbolt" Ross (William Hurt in a bad Sam Elliott mustache and a worse mood) is hot to catch Bruce and use his gamma-rich blood to start a race of supersoldiers. So as on the 1970s television series that, like the movie, was based on a Marvel Comics character, Bruce becomes a lonely fugitive.
Norton mopes through the part almost as much as Bill Bixby did on TV. It's hard to imagine Norton sitting around thinking, "I've got to get myself in a film that lets me play a scientist hiding as a drone in a soda factory for some scenes and as a pizza delivery boy for others. Then in the really good moments, a big, green monster makes them forget all about me." But that's what happens.
Whenever Liv Tyler is around, as Betty Ross, Bruce's lady love and the general's daughter, Norton gets to make moony faces. Tim Roth doesn't fare much better. He shows up as Blonsky, a British mercenary working for the general and eager for a taste of Bruce's power. Needless to say, he gets it and them some.
The effects crew does a lot of the heavy lifting. Indeed, all the stunts and effects look expensively impressive. That big uptown wrecking-ball climax is a rousing, if hectically edited, spectacle that pits the Hulk against the beast Blonsky becomes. In the comic, this creature was called the Abomination. Yet watching these two computer-generated behemoths go at it is a notch above watching a furious round of Mortal Kombat.
You may recall that we've been here before - just five years ago, in fact. The occasion was "Hulk," director Ang Lee's frigidly received approach to the same comic book, and, boy, does that movie seem ingenious by comparison. "Hulk" was a study in psychological stress that still holds up as a criminally underrated dual character profile. Aside from the halfhearted blockbuster showdowns, it was an art-movie with military ambushes.
"The Incredible Hulk" is a commercial rebuke to Lee's psycho-melodrama. The trouble with blockbusters now is that there's no room for the risks Lee took, however minimal they actually were. This rebooted Hulk has been made with minimal cinematic or psychological value and seems utterly terrified of exploring the Hulk's erotic possibilities. Betty and Bruce make out, but stop when his heart speeds up, which makes you wonder: How many days without incident in that department?
Of course the movie does bring the green guy back into franchiseable planetary alignment within the Marvel Comics universe. If the coda doesn't promise better sequels in the future then it certainly hints at more synergistic ones.
For now there's a certain pleasure to be had in some of the physical blowouts. "The Incredible Hulk" has a fearsome playfulness when its giant star is slamming two hunks of car together like cymbals or bashing the Abomination's head into the street. But the best thing in the movie is made of human flesh. It's Tim Blake Nelson, arriving late as a biology professor. He's the one scientist in the movie with a scientist's enthusiasm for discovery. Tyler, by comparison, plays her biologist like a woman running an art gallery.
Screenwriter Zak Penn knows his Marvel, and director Louis Leterrier can certainly keep a fight sequence going forever (he made the two "Transporter" movies). But in their determination to make a reliable action movie, they forgot to make an interesting one.


Rebooting a blockbuster franchise that never got off the ground in the first place may not seem like the smartest move, but there is a certain brute logic to it: Scrutinizing the bomb in question can offer up 100 mistakes from which to learn. In the case of Ang Lee 's 2003 Hulk , those invaluable lessons include: Don't dramatize a Marvel comic book about a scowling humongous green man-monster by giving it a convoluted Freudian backstory austere enough to agonize Ingmar Bergman; don't strip your movie of all lightness, comedy, and low-down kicks; and don't have Nick Nolte, looking as disheveled as he did in his famous mug shot, show up to chew more scenery than the Hulk does. The Incredible Hulk , with a new director and cast, rectifies those glitches, and the reboot strategy has an added bonus as well. The audience, in all likelihood, will be so grateful not to see another joyless, inert, pea green dud that it may not mind that The Incredible Hulk  is just a luridly reductive and violent B movie  one that clears a bar that hadn't been set very high.
The film gets all the arduous backstory stuff (lab experiment gone kerflooey, etc.) out of the way in the opening credits, then catches up with Bruce Banner (Edward Norton  ), the molecular-research scientist-turned-unwitting Hulk, as he hides out in the layered semi-slums of Brazil, doing his best to be his own anger-management counselor. As onscreen titles flash things like  ''Days Without Incident: 157,'' Banner, who works incognito on a soft-drink assembly line, tries to keep down his pulse rate, which ticks into the danger zone of Hulk transformation at around 200. The metaphor couldn't be clearer. With all that gamma matter in his cells, he's like a drug addict in recovery, trying to keep that nuclear rage from shooting into his system.
Stan Lee  , the Hulk's co-creator, has said that he came up with the character by crossbreeding Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The noble-freak poignance of Frankenstein  mostly eludes this movie, but we certainly feel Banner's Jekyll-like torment. Norton looks buff here, but his skinny, bearded face still narrows into a nerd's skewed smile. His Banner hates being the Hulk  he's scared of that power, wants it out of his body. But the Army, led by Gen. Thaddeus ''Thunderbolt'' Ross (William Hurt  ), plans to harness the Hulk as a weapon, and to that end chases Banner all over the globe, finally confronting him when he pops up on the Culver University campus, where he once toiled and now hopes to find the cure for what ails him.
It's quite a showdown. The 2003 Hulk, in his rubbery resilience, was essentially a defensive creature (Lou Ferrigno, in the TV series, was even less threatening  the simian version of a '70s hair model), but the new Hulk is offensive in every way, with ugly vein-mottled skin and a way of ripping jeeps in half, then hurling the hunks of metal at helicopters, to create one of those righteous ''Kiss off!'' fireballs. He's a rampaging force  Godzilla as bodybuilder  and the director, Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2  ), stages the film for maximum destructive excitement. It's a big, dumb boys' bash, and in the first huge action set piece, when the Hulk does his smash-and-grab thing and the military holds him back by blasting him with some sort of atomic wind machine, you may for a few moments have that long-sought ''Whoa!'' sensation, the one that takes you back to the thrill of the original comics.
A scene like that almost makes up for the flat, logy dialogue between Norton and Liv Tyler   as Betty Ross, his science-geek girlfriend. Or the fact that a comic-book movie that isn't weighed down by too much story isn't  the same thing as a comic-book movie with a great story. Of all the famous superheroes, the Hulk, as film material, has a special limitation, which is that it's hard to empathize deeply with the pain of this unjolly green giant at the same time that we're cheering on his orgies of apocalyptic mayhem. There are a couple of amusing actors scattered around The Incredible Hulk : Tim Blake Nelson   as a jabbery scientist who likes to watch the Hulk transform a little too much, and Tim Roth   as a military man who turns himself into the Hulk's ultimate creature-feature nemesis. On that score, though, it might not have made a whole lot of difference had a less talented star than Edward Norton been cast in the lead. There's only so much that an actor can do when he's basically playing the straight man in Hulk vs. Predator .

 Five years ago there was a movie about Dr. Bruce Banner, a scientist who, when agitated, turns large and green. It was called “Hulk” and it didn’t do very well, either with critics or with the legions of comic-book fans expected to sacrifice a portion of their pocket money every summer to keep the movie studios afloat. Now Universal and Marvel, every bit as indomitable as their rampaging asparagus-colored intellectual property, have given the franchise another try.  The new movie about poor Dr. Banner, directed by Louis Leterrier (“The Transporter,” “Transporter 2”) from a script by Zak Penn (“X2,” “X-Men: The Last Stand”), is called “The Incredible Hulk.” But let’s not get carried away: “The Adequate Hulk” would have been a more suitable title. There are some big, thumping fights and a few bright shards of pop-cultural wit, but for the most part this movie seems content to aim for the generic mean. If you really need a superhero to tide you over until Hellboy and Batman resurface next month — and honestly, do you? really? why? — I guess this big green dude will do.  The latest Hulk, a computer-generated behemoth with torn pants and tousled hair, is a slightly improved version of the character created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby 46 years ago, though a cameo appearance by Lou Ferrigno, the Hulk on the old television series, may induce some fond nostalgia for the analog days when a superhero could be impersonated by an actual person. When calm, Bruce Banner is played, in “The Incredible Hulk,” by Edward Norton, who emphasizes the character’s somber, cerebral side. To avoid turning green and bursting out of his clothes, Bruce must keep his pulse low, and Mr. Norton, ever the professional, is careful not to do anything too exciting.  The origin story, dwelled upon at great length in “Hulk,” is here telescoped into a neat little montage that accompanies the opening titles. Bruce was conducting research for the Army under the supervision of a cigar-smoking general (William Hurt), whose daughter, Betty (Liv Tyler), was Bruce’s girlfriend. The experiment went horribly wrong and Bruce escaped to Brazil, where he lives with his dog in a hillside slum and works at a soda factory.  “Get our agents to look for a white man in that bottling plant!” the general barks when he learns of Bruce’s whereabouts. Though Brazil is home to millions of people who might fit the general’s description, the military has no trouble finding Bruce’s modest little home. A member of the squad sent to bring him in — the general wants Bruce’s data for further study, you see — is a hard case named Blonsky (Tim Roth) who you know will turn out to be the Hulk’s nemesis even before he shoots Bruce’s dog. In the meantime, after Bruce’s pulse rate spikes, the Hulk is glimpsed through the murk of night-vision goggles and in shadow, smoke and soda-pop vapor.  The creature looks better that way than he does when, a while later, he emerges in the light of day to smash up some government hardware on a Virginia college campus. Though the Hulk’s distended muscles are impressively veined — he looks less rubbery, and therefore more credible, than his precursor in “Hulk” — the scale and proportion of his body don’t seem quite right. His head is weirdly small, and his size in relation to other people and objects appears to fluctuate. Also, why is his hair so much darker than Mr. Norton’s?  That there is no resemblance between them is perhaps to be expected, but it also exposes a genetic flaw that makes “The Incredible Hulk” less interesting — clumsier, more brutish — than many of its comic-book-derived counterparts. Superhero movies depend not only on virtuosic special effects or action set pieces, but also, perhaps even more, on the psychological drama of existential division. The mild-mannered reporter is also the man of steel; the reclusive millionaire dons mask and cape to fight evil.  The better superhero performances explore the tensions inherent in their protagonists’ double  lives. Tobey Maguire’s Peter Parker is first liberated and then burdened by the demands of being Spider-Man. The various X-Men grapple with the social and emotional challenges of mutant-hood. More recently, Robert Downey Jr. used the ethical predicaments of Iron Man as the basis for a brilliantly complicated and unpredictable characterization. But the contradictions and continuities between Bruce Banner and the monster he becomes figure surprisingly little in “The Incredible Hulk.” When Betty asks Bruce what the transformation feels like he answers that the Hulk “isn’t me,” and in taking this disavowal at face value the movie sacrifices opportunities for pathos as well as humor.  A few such possibilities are hinted at. The blood-pressure thing makes Bruce afraid of having sex (though Betty seems somewhat intrigued by the idea), and Mr. Norton does a credible enough job of conveying how tiresome it must be to shred your shoes and clothes. But without a vivid, complex character at the center of the movie, even the more inspired bits — Tim Blake Nelson’s tenured mad scientist, a climactic battle on the streets of Harlem — feel perfunctory and familiar. A middling superhero movie! I wish I could say that was incredible.  “The Incredible Hulk” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has the usual comic-book mayhem.

What seemed, in theory, the least-necessary revival of a bigscreen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in �The Incredible Hulk.� Revisiting the character Ang Lee and James Schamus put under a psychological microscope in 2003 to mixed results, Marvel, Universal and several of the same producers have repackaged one of their better-known stable stars in a straightforward actioner that delivers the goods with no unnecessary frills or digressions. Happy to give the intended audience what it wants, this loud and quick-moving production will shake loose ample coin in all markets.
To anyone wondering why the Marvel team would so soon embark on a makeover of the growly green giant after all the angst endured on the previous one, the answer is provided by the final scene, in which the star of the most recent Marvel B.O. smash unexpectedly turns up to ask, �What if I told you we were getting a team together?� 
New film thus marks the first step in the label�s plan to begin shuffling its major characters into films together, a la some of the comicbooks -- a scheme that seemingly required the rehabilitation of the Hulk from something that came to be regarded as perhaps too rarefied, not of a piece with the studio�s other cinematic stalwarts.
Viewed in this utilitarian light, the new film gets its job done. It�s not especially exciting or surprising, lacking the cheek and sheen of �Iron Man� and the opulence and star power of the �Spider-Man� and �X-Men� series. But it�s better than the �Fantastic Four� pictures and �Daredevil� and manages to shift the title character from a hopelessly conflicted Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde to a wannabe good guy.
It seems that none of these Marvel-based films can begin with anything other than a medical experiment gone madly awry, leaving its subject with a drastically split personality. This one gets it over with pronto, after which scientist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) hides out anonymously in a Brazilian favela while desperately trying to decontaminate his blood, eliminating the cells that can make him, if sufficiently incensed, turn into a raging, bemuscled, 9-foot screamer with disagreeably antisocial habits.
Keen to track Bruce down is Army Gen. Thaddeus �Thunderbolt� Ross (a cigar-chomping William Hurt), who oversaw the experiment. He wants to bend the results to military purposes and sends mad-dog soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) flying down to Rio to snatch the elusive fugitive. Resulting pursuit is a partially parkour-style chase through the pinched passageways and across the roofs of the hillside slums that entertainingly recalls but doesn�t nearly match the flair of the opening sequence of �Casino Royale.� The Hulk makes his first kick-butt appearance in Brazil 23 minutes in, but is only partly seen, and in shadows at that.
Despite the manpower expended  to bring him to heel, Bruce is able to make his way back to Virginia, stopping en route in Mexico to buy a pair of stretchy pants, which he rightly predicts will prove useful down the line. In the intervening six months or so, g.f. Betty (Liv Tyler), old Thunderbolt�s daughter, has taken up with a new guy, but she immediately drops him when her old flame reappears with major issues to deal with. 
First and foremost, her dad wants to extract whatever�s inside him to augment the Pentagon�s arsenal (there�s no discussion of whether or not this super-steroid constitutes a chemical weapon). Second, Blonsky, who admires his adversary as �a whole new level of weird,� can�t wait to attain that level himself. After he volunteers to receive a dose, he�s able to compete with the Hulk up to a point in an explosive battle on a university campus lawn, but he�ll need more juice to have any hope of besting the green one in a street brawl.
Which is exactly what the showdown consists of. Following an interlude in which the Hulk takes Betty to what looks just like King Kong�s cave, both he and Blonsky enlist the services of an enthusiastic research doctor (Tim Blake Nelson in an amusingly over-the-top turn) to become battle-ready. With Blonsky transformed into a creature fully justified in being called the Abomination, they proceed, ripped and roaring, to lay waste to Harlem; that the finale would seem to be almost entirely a CGI-animated sequence will be noticed but not much minded.
It�s all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and with a hint of enthusiasm by helmer Louis Leterrier (the �Transporter� films, �Unleashed�) and penned with sporadic wit by Zak Penn. Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three -- actually six -- hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong�s ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic�s generally pro but not inspired achievements.
Norton gives indications of perhaps wanting to go places with the role that remain off-limits this time around (he no doubt would have been happy teaming with Lee), but he�s kept largely on the straight-and-narrow, to decent effect. Tyler is no more or less memorable in the femme lead than Jennifer Connelly was in �Hulk,� while both Roth and Hurt happily underplay by a bit what might have been expected of them in their villainous roles. 


In recent days, Universals been running a TV spot for The Incredible Hulk  that gives away what should come as no surprise to any fanboy worth his action figure collection: the appearance of Robert Downey Jr.  as, natch, Tony Stark . From the delighted, deafening squeals of at least one sneak-preview audience, its clear that the thought of an all-star Marvel Comics team-upAvengers, assemble! is a not-bad-at-all idea. Say this much for Ang Lee  and James Schamus , who tamed The Hulk and his acolytes into submission with a dreary, hulking take on Dr. Bruce Banner s rather unjolly green giant in 2003: Even they couldnt keep a good monster down.
Of course, it speaks to Universal execs worries about the fate of the franchise that theyve spoiled the spoiler for this complete reboot. For months stories have circulated that the persnickety Ed Norton , replacing Eric Bana  as The Hulks timid alter-ego, was demanding final cut over a screenplay hes said to have beefed up with chatty character-building sequences since excised. Add to that the critical drubbing Lees take rightly received, and theres an inevitable and justly deserved fear: Hulk no smash . Cheers to lower expectations, then, because The Incredible Hulk  is The Pretty Good Hulk. All things considered, of course.
Its still a superhero movie, with all the attendant noise and nonsenseand this time around, blessedly, the goofy geeks grin. (There are, at the very least, four tee-hee references to the old Bill Bixby  seriesincluding the use of Joe Harnells Lonely Man Theme, which everyone I knew in junior high could play on the piano.) The Hulk franchise has also bowed to the inevitable: the villain lifted straight from yellowed comic book pages, a la Spider-Man s Green Goblin, Batman s Joker, and Superman s Lex Luthor . In this instance, its the Abomination, who made his debut in Tales to Astonish  No. 90 way back in 1967. His origins been altered, but Emil Blonsky  (Tim Roth , yet another A-actor playing dopey dress-up) is more or less the same as his funny-paper predecessor, roided up and ready to rumble.
Having dispensed with the origin story in the first film, the Incredible Hulk is bourne again. Bruce Banners on the run, he turns into the Hulk, he smashes some stuff, he meets up with gal pal Betty Ross  (Liv Tyler ). Rinse, lather, repeat.

Then again, unlike in Jon Favreau s film, which featured a far more interesting hero than Banner, you need that big bang herethat cathartic exclamation point at the end of a long story. And Norton, try as he does with an almost heroic effort to make Banner as interesting as his towering, verdure-shaded beefcake within, doesnt possess Downeys casual radiance. Which isnt even all that noticeable, till Stark shows up for his precious few moments of screen time to remind the audience of the all-too-obvious: Iron Man  was just a superhero movie too, only it was one that almost couldnt be bothered with the superhero part. It worked solely because of Downeythe unadorned, unfettered actor who was larger than life in nothing so much as a T-shirt and a smirk.
Nortons almost faced with a no-win proposition: Hes a perfect Bruce Banner, actuallyscrawny, guilt-ridden, beaten-down, and desperate to rid himself of the beast within. And the fanboys will certainly recognize him from the comic books, far better than they did Banas brooding, bulked-up version. (Norton looks like he stepped right out of the funny pages, especially the recent Ultimates  snark attack from which Marvel seems to be shaping its film franchise.) But Banners a weakling in the comic booksto the point where writers have begun depicting him as suicidal, or almost eradicated him entirely. Which would have been just a wee bit problematic for Universal, who clearly wants another franchise to hawk. So the filmmakers and Norton trod the middle ground: Banners just a guy trying to excise his more interesting better half, for which I believe theres therapy.
