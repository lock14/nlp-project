"Jumper" is about a young guy who teleports all over the world. Initially, he does what you or I might do - pops into a bank, robs its safe, and buys a swank New York apartment, where he keeps an elaborate visual log of all the places he's been over the course of eight or so years. The locations are global but the thinking in this movie is small. But eventually, David Rice (Hayden Christensen) returns to Ann Arbor to see Millie (Rachel Bilson), the girl he loved in high school who, it appears, has now shelved her own dreams of wanderlust to do honest work as a barmaid. This movie should be playing on the CW between episodes of "Reaper" and "One Tree Hill."
The script is credited to David S. Goyer ("Batman Begins," the "Blade" movies), Simon Kinberg ("Mr. and Mrs. Smith"), and Jim Uhls ("Fight Club") who've committed various dilutions to Stephen Gould's young-adult books, which were like Salinger sci-fi. Now a story about an abused teen who used his superpowers to escape trauma is now an exceedingly ordinary action movie in search of franchisehood.
"Jumper" doesn't bother exploring the psychological convenience of being able to teleport away from a shout-aholic father (Michael Rooker in a telltale sweaty white undershirt). Instead, it opts for would-be epic adventure. David discovers that his abilities have landed him in the persecuted half of an eons-long war. Sigh. On one side, David's race of teleporters, called Jumpers. On the other, efficient Paladins organized to extinguish them. The movie turns into a long chase between David and Samuel L. Jackson, the Jumper Slayer. (His silver haircut cruelly keeps memories of Sisqó alive.)
A frivolous trip to war-torn Chechnya is a moral gaffe that belongs in a smarter film. Otherwise, there are nicely imagined fights at the Colosseum and in the Sahara. The movie's small details are pretty cool. Jumpers can grab something in one location (a bus, say) and teleport it to another location where it can be used on a Paladin. Whenever a Jumper jumps, rooms shake, papers fly, the air seems a little moist, and a hole remains for someone else to leap through. When he lands (we haven't yet met a she-jumper), the new space is practically destroyed and deluged with, what, afterbirth? (Libraries take a beating in this movie.) Scientific realism aside, the technical care (the effects and fast, smooth editing) that's gone into "Jumper" is exciting.
Working with a very talented crew, the director Doug Liman knows how to keep a movie interesting here and there. He did it with the crummy "Mr. and Mrs. Smith." His "Bourne Identity" was a complete, sustained kinetic work. But Liman appears to be the sort of filmmaker who prefers ballistics and physics to people. The action scenes would be a lot more thrilling if we cared about the characters or the actors playing them. (Jamie Bell is an exception as a punk Jumper.)
But what can you do with Hayden Christensen? He's as close as we have to an android actor. It's all a chore for him. He never looks sufficiently scared, impressed, or surprised by any of this - not even the Oedipal twist with Diane Lane or the requirement that he drag the oft-imperiled Bilson from one scene to the next. Her exasperation makes perfect sense. What's with this damsel business? Her indifference 
to all the science here seems improbable. It's as if Larry Summers approved her part. Bilson had more to do wearing a patriotic bikini on the cover of this month's GQ. And sadly I had more to do reading it.

In Jumper , Hayden Christensen, more suavely chiseled than we've seen him before, his heavy brows and dark eyes narrowed to laser focus, plays David Rice, who discovers that he can teleport himself to any spot on the globe. As he passes through wormholes, or something, in the space-time continuum (though that's more of an explanation than the movie provides), he leaps, at the commanding snap of his mind, from his dad's working-class house in Ann Arbor, Mich., to the clock face at the top of Big Ben, or onto the head of the Sphinx for an impromptu picnic  sort of like what Elizabeth Montgomery used to do on Bewitched . He also isn't above popping himself over to the refrigerator for a beer, or into a bank's security vault to make off with mounds of cash, which is awfully convenient, since it allows him to live the life he chooses, complete with sleekly sprawling apartments in half a dozen cities.
If David did all this while wearing a skintight jumpsuit with a big lavender J  emblazoned on his chest, we could probably call Jumper  the lamest superhero movie of the year, and leave it at that. But David isn't trying to save the world; he's simply a guy on the move  an amoral globetrotter, flashing through space on his whims. The director, Doug Liman, once made a thrilling gem of a movie about testy twentysomethings who couldn't stop moving  it was called, quite perfectly, Go   and you could say that Jumper  also tries to tap the spirit of go-go youth. Except that there really isn't a whole lot to David, or to anyone he meets. He takes the girl he has a crush on (Rachel Bilson) to Rome  to hide his powers, à la Clark Kent, the two fly there on a plane  but the actors don't exactly strike sparks. On a tour of the Colosseum, he learns that there are other Jumpers around too, but mostly he's a cipher loner bopping around in astrophysical limbo. When he crashes into downtown Tokyo, it's just another backdrop, another hasty frequent-flier effect. For all that we care, he might as well be running in place.
Doug Liman is no longer the fresh storyteller he once was, but the trajectory of his career tells a story of its own. He has become a one-man paradigm of what's happened to Hollywood, moving from character to pure kinetics. His first film, Swingers  (1996), is still his best  a classic of tangy talk, of men behaving badly but doing it with chatty grace, in a hilarious neo-Rat Pack style. With Go  (1999), Liman kept his pinpoint sense of generational 'tude; when he followed that up with The Bourne Identity  (2002), no one could begrudge this indie graduate the right to make a square-jawed action spectacular. But two years ago, with the love-is-a-battlefield Brangelina romantic comedy Mr. & Mrs. Smith , Liman overdosed on octane; there was something cheesy yet decadent about it, as if he had decided, halfway through, to say to the audience, ''Screw that nuance stuff! You know you just want to see things blow up!'' Jumper  feels even more chicly jaded. Powered by faux wide-eyed spasms of technology (the blurry images and mini sonic booms that signify David's leaps), it's the first Liman film designed to do little more than goose your motor impulses. There's no real behavior, just endless movement brought off with empty crackerjack skill.
Liman, for all his craft, doesn't have enough fun  with the premise. Considering that fantasy and science fiction are now the air we breathe, we can accept David's space-tripping abilities without blinking an eye, and I wish that he had something more exciting to do than stay out of the way of Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), one of a group of ''Paladins'' who are devoted to wiping out the Jumpers because, in Roland's words, ''Only God should have the power to be in all places at all times!'' Jackson, wearing a faintly absurd silver G.I. Joe buzz cut, makes a Paladin sound a bit like the Bush administration's idea of a terrorist: He hates the Jumpers' freedom. Period. David also collides with a fellow Jumper, played by Jamie Bell as a kind of scruffy British Huck Finn-meets-'80s alt-rocker. Bell has a witty, insouciant presence; he doesn't take any of this too seriously, an attitude that looks good on his squirrelly features. That's more than you can say for Hayden Christensen, a gifted actor who tends to be at his best in films like Shattered Glass , when he can dip into an undertow of anxiety and low cunning. In Jumper , trying to be the coolest of skywalkers, he's just a hollow contradiction, a stolid man in motion.

 It’s impossible for outsiders to know who deserves most of the blame for this dud —  its director, Doug Liman, its three screenwriters, its multiple producers or the various studio executives who might have done far too much meddling or not nearly enough. Whatever the case, “Jumper” —  a barely coherent genre mishmash about a guy who transports himself across the globe at will  —  is of interest only because it revisits a theme that Mr. Liman has explored in films like “The Bourne Identity” and, if reports about his troubled productions are true, speaks to his own reputation as an escape artist: the character who wiggles out of trouble.  The trouble here starts when a likable high-school loser, David Rice (Max Thieriot), discovers that he can do an end run around the space-time continuum, teleporting from here to there faster than Dorothy can click her sparkling red shoes. Before long he’s zipping from Detroit to Tokyo (and into bank vaults) and has transformed into a materialist slacker (now played by a somnolent Hayden Christensen) whose rooms are filled with goodies and walls are papered with images of his fave jump spots. One minute he’s cruising a blond sylph in London; the next, he’s hanging with the Sphinx in Egypt. It’s all good, except that it’s all bad, from the subliterate dialogue to the chaotic direction and heavily edited points in between.  Then, you know, something happens. In this case, the something is mostly Samuel L. Jackson, who, as a mysterioso avenger, arrives barking his lines and wearing the latest addition to what has become a notorious collection of extreme hairpieces and looks. Snow white and close cropped, Mr. Jackson’s hair in this film dominates its every scene (it’s louder than the predictably voluble actor), rising out of the visual and narrative clutter like a beacon. It glows. It shouts. It entertains. (It earns its keep.) It also suggests that someone here has a sense of humor, as does the casting of the persuasively thuggish Michael Rooker (“Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer”) and the woefully misused Diane Lane as David’s estranged parents.  Luckily for Ms. Lane, her character doesn’t get much screen time, largely because she appears to be on hand only to help humanize David, to counterbalance the brutal father with the sentimentalized mother. She’s as disposable as the pretty bland thing (Rachel Bilson) who tags along with David for a while and has been written into the screenplay for all the reasons female characters are usually written into male coming-of-age stories, namely she looks good in her underwear and establishes the hero’s heterosexuality. Ms. Bilson fills out her bra nicely, but is nowhere as seductive as Jamie Bell, who, as a British jumper called Griffin, gives the film a jolt of energy along with a heartbeat. When he jumps, so does the film.    “Jumper” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned.) Lots of fights but little blood.

Slick but extremely slim, "Jumper" seemingly attempts to heed the advice of its teleporting protagonist, who at one point suggests a trip to Rome that will "skip all the boring parts." Similarly eliding much of the exposition -- or simply delivering belches of it on the fly -- director Doug Liman churns out a serviceable sci-fi thriller/videogame template that plays like "The Matrix Lite" and, finally, isn't nearly as cool as its trailer. Nevertheless, pic could engineer its own lucrative heist by zeroing in on young males itching for action during the traditional pre-Oscar malaise.
After an introductory sequence in which we see a teenage version of David Rice (Max Thierot) discover his strange power to instantly leap from one location to another, pic itself jumps eight years to find him enjoying the fruits of that ability. The world is almost literally his oyster, as David (now played by Hayden Christensen) flits to London for a one-night stand, escapes just as quickly to lunch on the pyramids and finishes the day surfing in Fiji -- all financed via the banks he robs by zapping into the vaults.
OK, so that blue guy in "X-Men" did it first, it's still a rather enviable talent, and one that can't go unchecked for long. Enter Roland (Samuel L. Jackson underneath a shocking white mane, but otherwise in a familiar mode), a driven pursuer of "jumpers" who deems them "an abomination." He is, we're eventually told, a paladin, part of a shadowy group that has been pursuing and eliminating jumpers for centuries.
David picks up that useful info from another, more experienced jumper, Griffin (Jamie Bell, the grown-up "Billy Elliot"), but it comes a little late, inasmuch as he's already jumped back to Michigan to reconnect with the dream girl from his youth, Millie (Rachel Bilson), whisking her off on an improbable European tour and inadvertently putting her at risk.
Having demonstrated his action chops on "The Bourne Identity" and "Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Liman has fun with the initial exploration of David's skills, which he shows off to Millie like a shiny new sports car. Although primarily shot in Toronto, pic boasts sequences in Tokyo, Egypt and Rome's Colosseum, and the effects team (among them "The Matrix" alum Joel Hynek) pretty convincingly captures the lengthy roster of exotic locales, as well as images of jumpers dragging objects through their portals with them, which possesses a visceral kick.
Once the larger plot kicks in, however, the movie is a bit too chaotic for its own good, and its scope feels disappointingly small. Mostly, David and reluctant mentor Griffin take on what appears to be Roland and a handful of guys -- more a skirmish than the historic "war" to which Griffin refers. The dialogue is also consistently clunky -- a side effect, perhaps, of the sequential efforts of writers David S. Goyer ("Batman Begins"), Jim Uhls ("Fight Club") and producer Simon Kinberg (Liman's "Smith" collaborator) tackling Steven Gould's young-adult novels.
Christensen exhibits a helpful vulnerability despite a thinly drawn character, with every role before and since his "Star Wars" experience providing further evidence of how poorly served he was by those movies. Beyond that, there's virtually no time to add a second dimension to anyone (Diane Lane shows up in what amounts to a cameo), with Bilson's adorableness doing most of the heavy lifting to establish a semblance of girl-in-jeopardy romance.
"Jumper" isn't a bad time for what it is, but the movie itself plays like a preview of coming attractions. Indeed, given how the narrative speeds toward its tepid climax, the audience might be gripped by an underlying feeling the filmmakers almost seem to have harbored as well -- a yearning to skip the preliminaries and jump ahead to a bigger, better-written, more satisfying sequel.
