The title character of Max Mayer's Adam  is a 29-year-old electronics engineer with Asperger's syndrome  and yes, he is one of those charming, saintly, afflicted movie misfit child-men. He's played by British heartthrob Hugh Dancy, who never got the credit he deserved for romancing Isla Fisher with debonair understatement in Confessions of a Shopaholic . The way Dancy portrays Adam (with great skill), he's a hermetically shy, overgrown whiz kid who's like Forrest Gump with a touch of Norman Bates and the look of an elegantly skinny framed Jake Gyllenhaal.
Out on his own for the first time (in the opening scene, he attends his dad's funeral), Adam has little company beyond a freezer full of macaroni-and-cheese dinners, and his conversation consists mostly of nattering, to whoever will listen, about his favorite topic: the origins of the universe. He's got a makeshift planetarium set up in his New York brownstone, and when he starts to go on about star systems and black holes, he can get a little possessed. The shrewdest thing about Dancy's performance is that even when he makes eye contact, he doesn't quite make eye contact. Adam soaks up information, but he can't hear irony, jokes, or subtext; he can't feel  what other people are saying. He lives inside his head, and Dancy lets you see how Adam experiences his thoughts  which are mostly sensible, by the way  as if they were physical sensations knocking his body around. In reality, Asperger's syndrome includes a vast range of traits, but in Adam it's nothing more (or less) than a heightened form of solipsism.
The mild charm of Adam   and what makes it, at times, a piece of borderline kitsch  is that it's an affliction movie in which the hero's handicap is so much less severe than it is in, say, Rain Man  or Charly  that the film frequently seems a bit daffy for placing it so front and center. When Adam meets his new downstairs neighbor, a sweetheart of a grade-school teacher played by Rose Byrne (Damages ), Adam  begins to turn into one of those dramas in which a completely normal girl falls for a weirdly withdrawn guy because...there wouldn't be a movie otherwise. I know, I know: We're supposed to see all the love that Adam has bottled up inside. But it's hard to buy this relationship even for a moment. Adam  is sweet, meticulous, and, at times, sort of clever, but it's also a not-quite-surprising-enough heartwarming trifle. B–


 Playing a character who is mentally disabled can be a fast track to Oscar or to oblivion, and rare is the actor who can resist the statuette-winning, Hanks-Hoffman strategy of mannered tics and mechanical talk. And when you consider that not even Sean Penn could pull it off without making our eyeballs cringe, the performance of Hugh Dancy in the charming romantic comedy “Adam” is all the more impressive.  As the title character, a Manhattan engineer who suffers from Asperger’s syndrome (a form of autism), Mr. Dancy is credibly eccentric yet still accessible. His pin-neat apartment, stocked with multiple macaroni-and-cheese dinners and monotonal outfits, reflects a mind drawn to symmetry and familiarity. So when the dreamy Beth (Rose Byrne) moves into his building and his life, Adam — already at an emotional and professional crossroads — is forced to develop a whole new set of coping skills.  Considering the story’s twee details — Adam’s passion is the heavens, Beth’s is teaching tiny children — and a tonally disruptive subplot concerning Beth’s parents (Peter Gallagher and Amy Irving), “Adam” is more involving than you might expect.  The humor is delicate, and the performances sweet and sure; the script (by the director, Max Mayer) is not entirely predictable, and the Manhattan locations (lovingly photographed by Seamus Tierney) have a starry-eyed glaze. What, you mean New York City isn’t a tranquil, leafy haven?  “Adam” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Discreet coupling and overt soul-baring.

"Adam" is a conventional but delicately crafted drama that movingly tests the viability of a relationship between a young man with Asperger syndrome and his patient but uncertain girlfriend. Emotionally potent performances, gently offbeat humor and writer-helmer Max Mayer's assured touch guide this tender New York love story to a quietly hopeful conclusion, prevailing over some overly familiar situations and slight narrative missteps. Fox Searchlight, which acquired "Adam" after its Sundance premiere, will rely on favorable reviews to drum up enthusiasm for a film that, if marketed right, could appeal to a wide range of adult audiences.
Born-and-bred New Yorker Adam Raki (British thesp Hugh Dancy) has just lost his father. As we learn in short order, he also has Asperger syndrome, a developmental disorder characterized by physical clumsiness, low empathy and an inability to perceive what others are thinking. Indeed, the opening passages contain some rather too obvious signifiers of Adam's emotional stuntedness: a shot of him staring unfeelingly into his dad's open grave; a freezer stacked with nothing but macaroni-and-cheese TV dinners; a routine that sends him back and forth between his tidy flat and his job as an electronic engineer.
Pic hits another familiar beat -- but hits it effectively -- when Adam meets Beth Buchwald (Australian actress Rose Byrne), the attractive brunette who's just moved into his apartment building. Friendly and engaging by nature, Beth doesn't quite know what to make of Adam's initially avoidant nature and awkward communication style. But when she learns of Adam's condition and sees how he's drawn to her, almost in spite of himself, she decides to give him a chance.
Directing his first film since 1998's "Better Living," Mayer exquisitely balances the seriousness of Adam's disorder with the humor inherent in his attempts to bond with Beth, although their first and only lovemaking scene -- cut short by a discreet pan-and-dissolve -- surely reps a missed dramatic (or comic) opportunity. Other moments are perfectly judged, such as when Adam shows Beth his personal planetarium, or when he surprises her with a spontaneous display of affection.
But their relationship is endangered, in more ways than one, when Adam meets Beth's parents (Peter Gallagher, Amy Irving), who treat Adam kindly but harbor understandable reservations. More seriously, Beth's accountant father is about to stand trial for some alleged corporate malfeasance, the fallout of which forces Beth to decide once and for all whether Adam is worth holding onto.
The Adam character may bring "Rain Man" to mind with his lack of eye contact and habit of spouting arcane data in lieu of normal conversation (a device Mayer uses throughout to reliable comic effect). But Dancy's performance is a convincing, soulfully underplayed turn that harmonizes nicely with Byrne's winsome openness; both thesps divest themselves of their native accents with flawless results. In addition to Gallagher and Irving, Frankie Faison provides stellar support as Adam's friend and father figure, Harlan.
Tech package is modest but classy. Cinematographer Seamus Tierney applies a warm amber finish to many of the dimly lit interior shots, while the New York exteriors seem hushed and underpopulated in a way that suits the film's emotional tenor. A few judiciously chosen indie-pop tunes ably complement Christopher Lennertz's score. 


Other than Rose Byrne 's on-screen radiance and a soothingly warm palette lit by cinematographer Seamus Tierney , there's not much to get passionate about in this amiable chamberpiece from theater director Max Mayer . Hedging just about every bet it lays on the table to the tune of a gentle guitar, Adam  spins a wish-fulfilling romance between a recently bereaved young man with Asperger's syndrome (Hugh Dancy ) and his beauteous new neighbor, Beth (Byrne), who, all too conveniently, happens to work in a helping profession. Writer-director Mayer tries to reduce the improbability quotient by loading Beth up with burdens of her own (including Peter Gallagher , who does "feckless father" in his sleep) that test the authenticity of her values. To his credit, Dancy doesn't take the showstopping Rain Man  route, but, however underplayed, his Adam is all too authentic for most social intercourse. Clogged to the pore with pathos (boxes of mac-and-cheese stacked in Adam's freezer), bogus romanticism about mental illness (Adam sees natural wonders the rest of us don't), the obligatory kindly black helper (Frankie Faison ), and the saintly patience of the love interest, Adam  only confronts reality at the end, when it timidly owns up to the likelihood that such relationships only work if the healthy partner is willing to become a mother, not a wife.
