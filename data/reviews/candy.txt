A really attractive artist (A Good Year ’s Abbie Cornish) loves a really attractive poet (Heath Ledger, pictured with Cornish), which is a good thing in Candy , a wildly romanticized Australian druggie drama. Except they both love heroin, which is a bad thing  and not exactly a new druggie-drama notion. Plus, even as they spiral inevitably downward from ecstasy to hell  she turns tricks, he steals  they somehow still look really attractive, which is a ridiculous thing. Geoffrey Rush, a friend of director Neil Armfield, contributes a flourish as the couple’s enabler.

 The sight of young people going down the drain is never pleasant, particularly when there are needles jabbed in their arms. It isn’t just that watching anyone  probe  his or her veins with a sharp  tends to be pretty gross; it’s also that the ritual of heroin addiction, from the bent spoon to the elastic band snapping against the agonized flesh, has become a cinematic cliché. It doesn’t help matters that stories about heroin addicts are all alike: they shoot up, they nod out, they jones. Some users clobber old ladies for their purses; others roll up to the bank in a sleek   ride and make a painless withdrawal. But it’s always the same story, always.  The Australian film “Candy” doesn’t add anything substantively new to that story, though it has been nicely directed by Neil Armfield,  known in his  country for his theater work, and features striking performances from Heath Ledger and Geoffrey Rush. Mr.  Ledger plays Dan, a low-key charmer with a dewily pretty girlfriend, Candy (Abbie Cornish), and a growing appetite for heroin. The story opens shortly after Candy starts shooting heroin instead of snorting it, a decision that almost ends her life but also seems to strengthen the bond between the couple, who soar high and then higher. To abuse a famous line from another film: they’re young, they’re in love,  and they shoot up, which they do with increasing frequency and with increasingly calamitous effect.  Adapted from  a novel by Luke Davies, who wrote the screenplay with Mr. Armfield, “Candy” unfolds in separate movements rather coyly announced by title cards, including “heaven” and “earth.” Since, as Neil Young sings, “every junkie’s like a setting sun,” Dan and Candy can only spiral down, down, down, which they do in predictable fashion. As they hopscotch from pawn shop to whore house and beyond, Mr. Armfield invests their progressively bleak spaces and situations with a grungy patina that somehow never seems dirty enough, filthy enough,  grotesque enough. Even when the couple are screeching at each other, in the throes of a deep druggy need or drifting along in a narcotic haze, the roses in Ms. Cornish’s cheeks remain disconcertingly in bloom.  Mr. Ledger, by contrast, looks and plays the part of the scheming user exceptionally well. He’s deep in the character’s skin right from the start. If he seems especially comfortable in the role, it may be because he’s speaking in his own accent; he doesn’t appear to be clenching his jaw the way he sometimes does when he plays an American character, or maybe he’s just coming into his own as an actor. He’s very fine, which isn’t half as unexpected as the equally shaded performance delivered by Mr. Rush, who also has the chewiest, densest role. As Casper, a professor with a seemingly endless supply of drugs and lovers, Mr. Rush leads you into a room that, for all its despair, you don’t want to vacate anytime soon.  “Candy” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for  intravenous drug use, prostitution, adult language and nudity.

Life, love and addiction make a mostly bitter, but occasionally sweet, concoction in Oz drama "Candy," which is sometimes hard to swallow. Despite a fine perf by Abbie Cornish ("Somersault") in the title role, film belongs to Heath Ledger in terms of narrative and identification. Prospects of limited international arthouse success will be boosted if film scores any prizes in Berlin competish.
Adapted from a novel by co-scripter Luke Davies, pic reps the end of a 15-year cinematic hiatus for Oz legit director Neil Armfield ("Twelfth Night," "The Castanet Club"), who also serves as co- writer.
Wannabe poet and intravenous heroin user Dan (Ledger) is freshly in love with Candy (Cornish), a blond Botticelli angel with a yen for painting. As film begins, the lovebirds enjoy a trip on the Rotor, a spinning amusement park ride (and obvious metaphor) that pushes people to the circular wall with centrifugal force. As a heroin sniffer, Candy is just gaining momentum in her drug habit: After the opening credits, she bullies her b.f. into letting her inject, too. Despite a near overdose, Candy's first words after being revived by Dan are: "Let's have some more."
For Dan and Candy, their mutual intoxication leads to a spree of sex, shoplifting and smack that sees her produce a single painting entitled "The Afternoon of Extravagant Delight."
Egging on their addiction is Casper (Geoffrey Rush, typically superb), a gay chemistry prof and indulgent father figure who can always be counted on for free drugs or spare cash. Less enamored of their lifestyle are Candy's parents (Noni Hazlehurst and Tony Martin, both playing well in underwritten roles), who blame Dan for their daughter's narcotic needs.
Script charts the young couple's mutual decline and intermittent efforts to kick the habit. A cold-turkey sequence and a subsequent still-birth may prove too intense for some auds.
Despite a clear three-part structure set out in intertitles ("Heaven," "Earth," "Hell"), pic unevenly lurches from segment to segment and relies heavily on the actors to regain the script's lost rhythm.
Erratic mood swings are an inescapable element of junkiedom, but sudden shifts in behavior and narrative are too awkward to be explained away by addictive madness. Likewise, some dialogue is a little pat. Finale similarly misses the emotional vein it wishes to tap, and the air of tragedy and triumph seems forced.
Ledger convincingly adds to his repertoire with a warm depiction of the charmingly co-dependent Dan who both fuels and fears the addiction of his g.f. Cornish's performance feels like an extension of her "Somersault" debut.
Apart from the oft-used gimmick of an aerial p.o.v. that echoes the opening amusement park ride, Armfield's helming is restrained, allowing the viewer to savor the performances. Gritty look by d.p. Garry Phillips suits the downbeat mood, as do the forlorn pop songs on the soundtrack. Tech credits are generally as tight as a tourniquet.

Heath Ledger  and Abbie Cornish  play unbelievably gorgeous heroin junkies Dan and Candy in Candy , a don't-try-this-at-home melodrama adapted from Australian author Luke Davies 's aptly billed "novel of love and addiction." Essentially the film is Requiem for a Dream  with a lot less of that overrated indie's shooting-gallery pizzazz, although director Neil Armfield  does put his smacked-out couple on one of those centrifugally forceful amusement park rides in the very first scene in order to suggest that their young lives are, you know, spinning out of control. En route to drug hell, the film manages some faintly amusing moments, as when Dan, high at his own wedding, is treated to a boring elder's Graduate -level career counselreal estate, not plasticsand literally nods off. Cornish, Kidman- esque in her elusive, look-but-don't-touch allure, may have the title role here, but Ledger, long-haired and so soft-looking you'd think he was shot slightly out of focus, is the movie's real eye candy. Armfield's colorful sets keep things on the implausibly cheery side of surreal until the requisite withdrawal scene, which uses nothing more than a room-sized mattress and a pathetically old TV set as props, the quivering junkies left to their own devices. Any drug movie's effectiveness can be measured by the strength of its detox, and Candy doesn't sweeten the cold turkey. Still, it's a downward spiral from there in more ways than one. Never mind the neo-psychedelic-pop soundtrack and occasional double-vision cinematography: Dope just can't account for the film's fried brain cells.
