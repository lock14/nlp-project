There are many documentaries about the fashion world. Some, like Unzipped  (remember when Isaac Mizrahi was the new black?), are impish fun, and a few, like Valentino: The Last Emperor , have been marvelous. But the singular fascination of The September Issue , R.J. Cutler's lusciously revealing fly-on-the-wall portrait of Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue , doesn't hinge on clothes, or glamour, or the sprinkle of stars on display. (Look, it's Jean Paul Gaultier! And Sienna Miller!) It begins with the electromagnetic pull of power.







 “The September Issue,” a documentary about the creation of a single, very fat issue of American Vogue in a far-off gilded age (i.e., 2007), has little to say about fashion, the real ins and outs of publishing or the inner workings and demons of the magazine’s notoriously demanding meanie-in-chief, Anna Wintour. Rather, this entertaining, glib movie is about the maintenance of a brand that Ms. Wintour has brilliantly cultivated since she assumed her place at the top of the editorial masthead in 1988 and which the documentary’s director, R. J. Cutler, has helped polish with a take so flattering he might as well work there.  To judge from the flurries of behind-the-scenes evidence, however, if Mr. Cutler did work for the exacting Ms. Wintour he would still be doing reshoots. Shot on digital with an eye for sumptuous color by Bob Richman and briskly edited by Azin Samari, the  88-minute movie opens with Ms. Wintour explaining that “there is something about fashion that can make people very nervous.” Certainly she unnerves her staff, as you soon see from all the huddled bodies and popping eyes. Even the more self-possessed, like Candy Pratts Price,  seem in the grip of awe. Is Ms. Wintour the “high priestess” of the magazine, an off-camera voice asks. “I would say  pope,” Ms. Price says with a queasy smile.  Many will grasp this distinction, having already watched supplicants kiss the ring in the 2006 film “The Devil Wears Prada,” with Meryl Streep as a thinly disguised, fictionalized and Americanized version of Ms. Wintour. Etched in acid and often hilarious, the performance, while not wholly modeled on Ms. Wintour, helped humanize her public profile, lessening the sting of the original book, a roman à clef by one of her former assistants, Lauren Weisberger. The documentary continues this humanization largely by showing Ms. Wintour very hard at work, rather lonely and sensitive about her British family’s low opinion of fashion. She’s a poor little rich girl swaddled in fur and iced to the bone.  She’s also pretty funny, perhaps at times accidentally so. Much of the movie’s pleasure comes from the utter ease with which Ms. Wintour plays the Red Queen of fashion and orders off with their heads (and even tummies). In the case of the British actress Sienna Miller, the cover girl for the September 2007 issue, which gives the movie its structure and hook, the head in question receives the 21st-century version of a severing: it’s Photoshopped to unreal perfection. However lovely, Ms. Miller proves a problematic Vogue ideal for the editors, many of whose own faces are somewhat surprisingly scored with wrinkles. It’s a mark of how pitiless Ms. Wintour can come across that you end up feeling a bit sorry for Ms. Miller.  In truth Ms. Wintour was just doing her job. Yes, there’s cruelty here, but of the most attenuated kind: she says no, employees tremble. The strongest, like the flame-haired Grace Coddington, the magazine’s longtime creative director and the documentary’s hugely diverting stealth star, seem to have figured out how to survive with their dignity intact. Most of the truly ugly stuff in fashion — the models  starving themselves, the exploited Chinese workers cranking  out couture fakes and the animals inhumanely slaughtered for their fur — remains unnoted in “The September Issue,” much as it often does in Vogue. And while the movie shuns any overt discussion of money, it includes an instructive scene of Ms. Wintour playing the coquette with one of the magazine’s important advertisers.  Of course it really is all about money. Despite being crammed with glossy images of beautiful, weird, unattractive, ridiculous and prohibitively expensive clothes and accessories, Vogue isn’t about fashion: it’s about stoking the desire for those clothes and accessories. It’s about the creation of lust and the transformation of wants into needs. Almost everything in this temple of consumption, including its lavish layouts and the celebrities who now most often adorn its covers, hinges on stuff for sale. Some of that stuff comes with a price tag, but some of it is more ephemeral because Vogue is also in the aspiration business. Mr. Cutler doesn’t notice or doesn’t care about any of that, which makes his movie as facile as it is fun.  Given this, it’s no surprise that Ms. Wintour is doing her part to flog the documentary: she gave a party in its honor and recently appeared on David Letterman’s show,  with and without her signature sunglasses, her glazed stare and tight smile firmly in place. The movie affords you many opportunities to marvel at the parsimony of that smile and wonder if she’s as bored as she looks, even while waiting for an agitated Stefano Pilati, the creative director at Yves Saint Laurent, to show his newest collection.  “That’s pretty,” she says, in a voice so drained of affect it’s a wonder he doesn’t commit seppuku with his scissors. You feel bad for Mr. Pilati, but it’s Ms. Wintour’s hauteur that makes you laugh and keeps you willingly at her side.  “The September Issue” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some understandably nasty words.

Some juicier behind-the-scenes drama and a more revealing examination of the creative process might have bulked up �The September Issue,� vet documaker R.J. Cutler�s fly-on-the-wall look at Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and her team of designers, stylists and photographers as they assemble the magazine�s most anticipated edition of the year. But what remains is still a dishy and engrossing peek inside the fashion world�s corridors of power -- every bit as slickly packaged as the publication it seeks to uncover -- that should rivet couture enthusiasts in endless trips down the cable runway.
Cutler was granted full access to Wintour during production of the magazine�s enormous and influential September 2007 issue, and her cooperation may explain why the result feels like a kid-gloves treatment of the notoriously icy and imperious fashion-world icon. Wintour certainly comes across as a tough cookie, but at no point in this largely admiring portrait does she seem as monstrous as her fictional alter ego in �The Devil Wears Prada.� She does, however, seem just as powerful -- a woman whose knack for spotting and shaping trends has earned her a privileged position in command of both a multibillion-dollar global industry and said industry�s coverage.
Pic�s most glamorous interlude is a Rome shoot with actress-model Sienna Miller (whose hair and teeth come in for some knocks from the staff). But for the most part, d.p. Bob Richman�s camera is content to prowl the magazine�s Gotham offices, showing how the decisions made by models, photogs and designers in far-flung European locales matter less, in the end, than whether they meet with Wintour�s approval. And Wintour -- shown brusquely poring over garment racks and photo spreads -- says no much more often than she says yes.
Candidly venting her frustrations at Wintour�s often blunt dismissals, Vogue creative director Grace Coddington, surprisingly, emerges as the docu�s most sympathetic and engaging figure (humanizing glimpses of Wintour�s home life notwithstanding). A former British Vogue model, Coddington has worked with Wintour for two decades, and their relationship, animated by mutual suspicion and grudging respect, is among the pic�s chief pleasures.
Like the hit movie version of �The Devil Wears Prada,� �The September Issue� often resorts to bubble-gum montages (edited by Azin Samari), hurling evening wear, headdresses and pop songs at the screen and inviting the viewer to get lost in the magnificent chicness of it all. The clothes are fab, to be sure. But a more rigorous, analytical approach would have offered more insight into Wintour�s aesthetic criteria (about the only concrete thing we learn is that she likes fur and hates black) and reinforced her belief, shared early on, that fashion is more than just expensive fluff.
Cutler grants ample screen time to young American designer Thakoon Panichgul, who touchingly offers himself as an example of the many rising talents Wintour has championed over the years; other industry luminaries interviewed include Mario Testino and Patrick Demarchelier and designers Oscar de la Renta, Vera Wang and Jean Paul Gaultier. Offering abundant comic relief is Vogue editor-at-large Andre Leon Talley, whose personality and flamboyant fashion sense match his outsized frame. 


When, in the early '00s, I worked as a freelancer for a publication two floors below Vogue  —this was pre–Devil Wears Prada —each sighting of Anna Wintour , no matter from how great a distance, was terrifying enough to immobilize me for a few seconds, leading to a sweaty paralysis when I found myself alone with her in an elevator. Wintour's arctic imperiousness has a way of creating the most masochistic deference, a dynamic that R.J Cutler superficially explores—and becomes prone to—in his documentary The September Issue .
Cutler, one of the producers of 1993's The War Room , was granted full access by Wintour to film the creation of her magazine's September 2007 issue, which, at 840 pages, was the largest ever in Vogue 's history. Who knows why the infamously aloof and inscrutable editor chose to cooperate—to do Miranda Priestly  better than Meryl Streep ? To quell rumors that she would be replaced by French Vogue  EIC Carine Roitfeld ?—but her blessing seems to account for her kind treatment here; none of Wintour's many detractors speak in the film. Though Wintour is definitely shown as curt, dismissive, and demanding, Cutler includes this explanation from gung-ho Vogue  publisher Tom Florio : "I don't find her hidden. I just don't find her accessible to people she doesn't need to be accessible to. She's busy—she's not warm and friendly."
Filmed in tight close-up at the doc's beginning, her pageboy-bob helmet immovable, Wintour offers, smiling as best she can, her own unconvincing defense of her life's work to naysayers: "People are frightened of fashion. Because it scares them or makes them nervous, they put it down. There is something about fashion that can make people very nervous." Those people might include Wintour's beloved daughter, Bee, who says she would prefer a career in law to fashion ("It's a really weird industry for me. Sorry, Mommy") or the editor's three far-more-civic-minded siblings, of whom Wintour, in her most revealing moment, can only say, "I think they're very amused by what I do."
The quick peeks into Her Highness's inner life break up Cutler's too-often-rushed, montage-heavy countdown of the frenzied months leading up to that behemoth issue's close, capturing the desperate attempts of Vogue  staffers to please their boss and their singular, gnomic pronouncements at meetings: "The jacket is the new coat." Even Vogue 's queenly editor-at-large, André Leon Talley , must bend to Madame's will, explaining his presence on a tennis court: "Miss Wintour said I had to lose weight. What Miss Wintour says, goes."
But not always. Grace Coddington , Vogue 's creative director and the only one who dares to say no—if not always directly—to Wintour, emerges as The September Issue 's true star, or at least the player with the greatest resolve, a devoted romantic who still has the sanest perspective on the industry. A former model from North Wales , whose career on the runway ended after a car accident, the flame-haired Coddington started at Vogue  the same day as Wintour, beginning a decades-long relationship of both begrudging respect and some inspired passive-aggressive behavior: Coddington is especially gifted at manipulating the presence of Cutler's crew to get what she wants from her boss.
If it feels perverse to cheer when Coddington's lavish visions—including a couture spread at the gardens of Versailles —ultimately dominate the magazine, it's a reminder of what a completely different era two years ago was. The September 2009 Vogue  issue has 256 fewer pages than 2007's; last month, Si Newhouse  called in consulting firm McKinsey & Co. to audit Condé Nast 's spending. During the closing credits of Cutler's film, a scene at a printing press depicts the assembly of the doorstopper issue as lovingly as similar moments in the broadsheet-dramas The Soloist  and State of Play . "I get very angry," Wintour notes in confessional mode about the demands of her position. "When I find myself getting really angry, I'll leave." The choice may not be hers to make.
