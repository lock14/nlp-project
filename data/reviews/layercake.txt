         The never-named narrator/protagonist of the stylish British gangster film "Layer Cake" tells us from the beginning, "I'm not a gangster, but a businessman whose commodity happens to be cocaine."
 
  Played with cool aplomb by Daniel Craig, the nongangster drug dealer is meticulous about the way he handles his affairs. As the middleman of an international drug-trafficking ring, he appears to be good at what he does, adhering to a strict set of rules designed to keep him out of the reach of both the law and the seedier denizens of the British underworld.
 


         






    At the outset, we learn that XXXX (as he's identified in the credits) has decided to walk away from the business that has been very lucrative for him and go legit. As we have learned from umpteen like-minded genre films, that simply isn't going to happen.
 
  The brutish crime lord who is his supplier, Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), has an extracurricular assignment for him. He is to search for the drug-addicted young daughter of an even more powerful crime boss, Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon), a long-ago school chum of Jimmy's. Meanwhile, XXXX must also successfully negotiate at Jimmy's behest the sale of a million tablets of Ecstasy, the ill-gotten largesse of a crass, two-bit hood named Duke (Jamie Foreman), who has crossed a deadly Serbian gang in the process.
 
  What sets "Layer Cake" apart from the usual "Just when I thought that I was out they pull me back in" films is a stunningly suave performance by Craig, a top-drawer supporting cast and a dynamic directing debut by producer Matthew Vaughn. After headlining the dramas "Sylvia," "The Mother" and "Enduring Love," Craig has the type of star-making role that has people talking about him as a possible James Bond — though in truth, he is probably far too complex an actor to be confined by that role. In addition to Cranham and Gambon, Colm Meaney and George Harris are excellent as more gangsterly associates of XXXX.
 
  Vaughn, the producer of Guy Ritchie's "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels," "Snatch" and "Swept Away" (we're going to have to forgive him that last one), mines a similar milieu to the first two films and shows a real talent for dealing with antiheroes (for which he has been rewarded with the assignment of directing the upcoming "X-Men 3").
 
  Working from a script full of sharp dialogue and pointedly evocative sequences by novelist J.J. Connolly, Vaughn uses violence in an effective, nongratuitous way to sculpt the world of consequences in which his characters operate.
 
  A jaw-dropping scene set in a tearoom in which XXXX's top lieutenant, Morty (Harris), delivers a savage beating to a man who once crossed him as XTC's "Making Plans for Nigel" segues into Duran Duran's "Ordinary World" on the soundtrack is a bravura display of Vaughn's aptitude for employing pop songs without turning the scenes into music videos.
 
  The Cult's "She Sells Sanctuary" and the Rolling Stones' "Gimme Shelter" are also used to great effect.
 
  It's not a perfect film, marred by some misguided flashbacks, an overcomplicated narrative and perhaps one too many reversals for its own good.
 
  However, "Layer Cake" — which draws its title from an implicit reference to the British class system and an explicit one in which Temple explains to XXXX their relative places in the criminal hierarchy — is a sleek, effective entertainment that is a refreshing respite from the slick emptiness of recent American crime dramas.

 A Sony Pictures Classics release. Director Matthew Vaughn. Producers Matthew Vaughn, David Reid, Adam Bohling. Executive producer Stephen Marks. Screenplay by J.J. Connolly, adapted from his novel. Director of photography Ben Davis. Editor Jon Harris Davis. Production designer Kave Quinn. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes. In selected theaters.   

The English actor Daniel Craig has the rare face that can look dashing and tormented at the same time. He's sexy in a hollow-cheeked, almost depressive way, like Steve McQueen after too many days on the Atkins diet, and his eyes  a set of steely blues  are as piercing as Peter Weller's were in RoboCop . In Layer Cake , the fast, convulsive, and densely exciting new British gangster thriller, Craig plays a London cocaine dealer, never named, who is forced to put his most ruthless underworld survival tactics to the test. The movie is organized around a reality that most gangster dramas (though not The Sopranos ) repress: the high anxiety of the criminal life. Written by J.J. Connolly, who adapted his own novel, this is the first film directed by Matthew Vaughn, who was Guy Ritchie's producer on Snatch  and Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels , and even if you thought that those films were all vacuous, tricked-up kinetic flash, you won't want to miss Layer Cake . A twisty film noir in daylight, with enough spinning time leaps to keep you on the edge of your mind and seat, it's like a Guy Ritchie movie with a brain. It's also the most crackerjack entertainment I've seen so far this year.
At the center of Layer Cake  is a crook who isn't quite a gangster  at least, not yet. Craig's character is a deadpan yuppie of the streets, a stealth opportunist who grooves on the easiness of cocaine money. As he talks to us in voice-over, confiding the tricks of the trade (and his secret plan to leave it all behind) with a seductive aplomb that recalls Ray Liotta's at the kickoff of GoodFellas , we think: This guy knows it all  the odds and the angles.
Actually, he knows next to nothing. Summoned to a meeting with Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), his shark-grinned rotter of a boss, Craig is given a pair of booby-trapped  assignments. He's to track down the runaway daughter of Jimmy's associate, and also to purchase and distribute a million Ecstasy pills from the disreputable Duke (Jamie Foreman). Jimmy, it turns out, has dastardly reasons for wanting the daughter found, and the pills have been stolen  from a ruthless Serb who'll stop at nothing to get them back. By doing no more than following orders, Craig is in a deep jam.
He meets every dilemma with fierce finesse, yet whether he's turning himself into a balletic assassin of the night or engineering a sting that pulls the rug out from under the  audience, the movie lets us see his invisible sweat. Vaughn stages one tautly electric scene after the next, serving up such memorable hooligans as a ghostly Serbian hitman who's a step ahead of you even when you think you're two steps ahead of him; Colm Meaney and George Harris as Craig's viciously loyal henchmen (one gets off on guns, the other revenge); and the great Michael Gambon as a silky philosophic Mr. Big who's at once a gentleman and the dirtiest of double-crossers. Layer Cake  doesn't divorce criminality from cool, but by the end of its bravura display of underworld grace under pressure, only a fool would envy these blokes their cutthroat lives.

he rangy British actor Daniel Craig slices through a room like a shark cutting through water. Mr. Craig, who is a few years shy of 40 and rumored to be in the running for Sean Connery's old gig as 007, has given the charismatically challenged British cinema a much-needed jolt in recent years. Even when his movies are far from perfect, Mr. Craig grabs your attention by the raw force of his physical presence. In the underrated "Sylvia," he turned the poet Ted Hughes into a bohemian pinup, a man whose internal fires made him seem hot to the touch; as the rake in "The Mother," he eased from sexy to repellent without dropping a beat. Mr. Craig smolders nicely and, as it also happens, he looks good slipping out of his shirt, which he does in the entertaining gangster flick "Layer Cake." It's a measure of Mr. Craig's allure that when he takes it off, he easily upstages the young actress Sienna Miller, a new It Girl who barely registers on-screen despite wearing little more than lacey filaments that make her look like a gift meant to be unwrapped very quickly. For Mr. Craig's character, a drug dealer hoping to cash out after a proverbial last job, Christmas seems to have come early. Alas, a knock on his hotel door doesn't bring Champagne, compliments of the house, but thugs who roughly deliver Mr. Craig's nameless character to his next plot point. Directed by Matthew Vaughn, making a smoothly assured debut, and written by J. J. Connolly from his book of the same title, "Layer Cake" is the newest in British gangland entertainment and the tastiest in years. Despite films like "Gangster No.  1" and the success of novelists like Mr. Connolly and Jake Arnott, author of the excellent "Long Firm," about a gay East End hoodlum  in the 1960's, the British gangster movie looked as if it might have suffered irreparable brain damage after the success of Guy Ritchie's idiotic combination punch, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch." Mr. Vaughn produced both those films, but nonetheless learned a few lessons along the way, particularly about pacing and directing actors. In each case, he keeps the human factor pre-eminent. As its title suggests, "Layer Cake" has a notably vertical architecture: it stacks layers upon layers, much as "The Usual Suspects" piled on the kinks, though with a surer, more intelligible sense of story. Mr. Craig's character, who, for the sake of ease will here be called the narrator, opens the proceedings by explaining his trade (coke dealer), his rules (don't cheat) and his world (criminal). The narrator works for Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham), a thug with posh tastes and no conscience who would as happily wine and dine the help as blow out their brains. Set to retire with a hefty nest egg, the narrator lands in trouble after Jimmy asks him to track down the missing daughter of a more powerful villain, Eddie Temple (the reliably excellent Michael Gambon). Of course there are myriad complications, including a stash of Ecstasy, Serbian gangsters, a two-bit gangster (Jamie Foreman) with a trigger-happy moll, and Colm Meaney and George Harris as a nicely matched pair of muscles-for-hire. The narrator navigates through good and evil, along with fate and happenstance, trying to reach his destination without too many bruises and nicks. There is murder, intrigue and an array of nasty behavior, including an unnecessarily brutal beating in a restaurant that soon loses any point or plot relevance amid so many vicious body blows. The blood in "Layer Cake" runs copiously, but with few exceptions it tends to run warm, as if still connected to the body that spilled it. Mr. Vaughn is unquestionably in the entertainment business, but he doesn't come across as overly amused by death. "Layer Cake" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has a sizable amount of bloody violence, including gunplay and one off-screen decapitation.

"Layer Cake," the helming debut for Guy Ritchie's producer Matthew Vaughn, unfolds in the same Blighty underworld milieu as did Ritchie's best known movies, "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels" and "Snatch," and shares a similar violence-flecked, soundtrack-driven m.o. But Vaughn's confidently constructed, sleekly designed tale of a drug dealer contemplating retirement offers more than just a collage of movie refs stitched together with black humor. "Cake" should be a sweet little earner in Blighty, but may struggle to match the numbers of "Snatch" abroad given the lack of name stars.
Played with urbane smoothness by up-and-comer Daniel Craig ("Enduring Love"), pic's unnamed narrator-hero (called just "XXXX" in end credits) is a professional middle-man between large-volume cocaine and pills importers and various street dealers out of West London.
XXXX has managed to squirrel away a tidy nest egg for his planned departure from the biz in a few days' time by following a few common-sense rules, such as not getting high on his own supply, laundering his money safely and not making enemies.
But his boss Jimmy Price (Kenneth Cranham) has two final jobs XXXX must do before he can collect his figurative gold watch. First, Price wants the runaway junkie daughter of kingpin Eddie Temple (Michael Gambon) found and delivered safely to him rather than her father. Second, XXXX must sort out the mess made by the Duke (Jamie Foreman, in fine manic form), who hijacked ecstasy tablets in Amsterdam from Serbian crime lord Dragan (Dragan Micanovic). Price wants XXXX to buy the pills from the Duke, but the soreheaded Serbs want them back.
While the hero begins to suspect he's been sent on a suicide mission, he discovers a reason to live when he falls in lust with Tammy (Sienna Miller), the slinky g.f. of the Duke's nephew Sidney (Ben Whishaw), on a nightclub dance floor in a luminously lensed sequence that packs a nice slo-mo erotic wallop.
By degrees, plot turns into a Chandleresque noir as XXXX's criminal gumshoe works through the complex strands of a backstory that involve not only Price and Temple but also his trusted co-workers Morty (George Harris) and Gene (Colm Meaney) and their complex alliances and grudges. Slightly clumsy flashbacks to the 1970s risk creating aud confusion with unnecessary details, and slow the train down just when it should be picking up speed.
Pic's title refers to a speech in which one character compares the hierarchical criminal society to a tiered cake.
Strong echoes are felt in both pic's plot and texture from Brian De Palma's "Carlito's Way," Paul Schrader's "Light Sleeper" and that ever-present touchstone of British crime thrillers, Mike Hodges' "Get Carter." But Vaughn and screenwriter J.J. Connolly (also making his film debut here with this impressively pared-down adaptation of his own novel) bring sufficient freshness to the dialogue and are sparing enough with the references so that pic never feels like a collage of obvious movie allusions, unlike Richie's work at its worst. There's a proper lived-in believability about "Layer Cake's" depiction of how the worlds of the rich, the criminal and the criminally rich intersect.
Fine supporting turns in well-written roles make this a meaty pie. Harris' mellow Morty, at first an apparent channeling of Danny Glover in a stereotypical black sidekick role, spectacularly upends expectations with a burst of violence. Gambon finds yet another way to project oleaginous bad-guy menace. Underwritten roles give femme thesps less to work with, although Sally Hawkins pumps her part as the Duke's killer queen Slasher.
In the end, however, it's very much Daniel Craig's movie. An actor every bit as capable as current British flavor-of-the-season Jude Law but handsome in a rougher, more broken-nosed way, Craig's range and dapper appearance here may finally help him break out as a star Stateside.
Tech package is pro, with kudos due in particular to Kave Quinn's well-observed production design.

Cloned out of a dozen or more recent movies that were themselves genetic thefts from older films, the new Brit-bad-boy potboiler Layer Cake  makes no bones about its inheritances: a self-guarded white drug dealer lookin' to get out, overwritten narration rationalizing the lifestyle as New World Order capitalism, an ironic tour of dope commerce from the '60s to today, lowlife amateur traffickers that laugh too much, reptilian superbosses, storytelling that circles back on itself fatalistically, and so on. The self-consciously jittery tale talks up the hierarchical "layer cake" of gangster culture, but it's difficult to detour around the layers of borrowed baloney, running backward from Guy Ritchie  and Paul McGuigan  to Tarantino and The Sopranos   and back to Scorsese, Mike Hodges , and Melville . What's abundantly clear is how far this kind of moviemaking has come from any knowledge of real criminal life; it's a geek's ineffectual daydream of mayhem. Vaughn, who began life as Ritchie's producer, knows as much about the quotidian of coke movers as Kelly Ripa .
Not that he and scriptwriter J.J. Connolly  don't talk a good game in the familiar style, all late-noir slang, philosophical aphorisms, eagle-eyed observation, and cant about money, money, money. Our unnamed hero (Daniel Craig ) is a crisply laconic midlevel wholesaler, working the relationship between the potentially unstable street seller and the billionaire mobster money men, who can hardly be discerned from politicians. Figuring he's got every angle sewn up, Craig's icy-eyed manager plans to retire, of course, but trouble begins when his Mr. Big (Kenneth Cranham ) orders him to locate a crony's junkie daughter, as well as negotiate the purchase of a million hits of Ecstasy from a hair-trigger psycho hood (Jamie Foreman ) who's reaching well above his pay grade. The girl doesn't want to be found, naturally, but the dominoes truly topple when the Slavs from whom the pills were stolen begin demanding them back. Betrayal, vengeance, doom.
Vaughn isn't nearly as hyperactive and irritating as Ritchie, but despite its nuances Layer Cake  has the tried-it excitement of a workout wall chart. Surprisingly, Craig almost kicks it to life; remembered here first as the weasel in Road to Perdition  and second as a weary Ted Hughes  in Sylvia , Craig very nearly makes the new movie's lean, extra-dry, well-dressed Outlaw Man seem like a fresh cut. Vaughn shoots him to invoke Steve McQueen  in virtually every shot, and dammit if the deliberate iconicity doesn't jell. There's little acting involvedthe seething support team does enough of that, notably George Harris  as Craig's right-hand man with a past, and Michael Gambon  drolly burbling as Mr. Biggestbut Craig's vulnerable yet supercool demeanor carries the old-school fiction lightly along.
If one weren't still wet to the eyeballs with dozens of self-referential Tarantino imitators, Vaughn's film might prove adequately refreshing, but little more. The subgenre's half-life is fadingat least, we hope it isand so an enterprising young turk angling to make a crater with his or her first film could do worse than to contemplate the opposite: a film about crime and its malcontents that actually, fastidiously attends to reality. When's the last time we saw that?
