Justin Lin�s promising 2002 film Better Luck Tomorrow
 � about a group of overachieving Asian-American schoolkids who get wrapped up in a murder � never fully engaged me while managing to woo other critics (and more than a few Sundancers) into a state of rapturous bliss. Compared to that challenging film, Annapolis
 is a thick but hardly meaty slice of old-school Hollywood hokum, the sort of film that in decades past might have attracted actors like Montgomery Clift or even John Wayne. As it stands, it�s a flimsy, all-too-predictable yawner that makes life at the legendary Naval Academy seem like a snore. If our future admirals are anything like Franco�s dopey-eyed plebe, we might as well scuttle the fleet right now. (Lin has recently been tagged to helm the U.S. remake of the superlative South Korean mind-warper Oldboy
, which may or may not be a good idea.) Franco, looking for all the world like the bastard offspring of James Dean and Matt Dillon, is Jake Huard, a young riveter at the Navy�s shipyard who has dreamed of entering Annapolis since the death of his mother years ago. When he lucks in, Jake finds himself drilled to death by Midshipman Cole (Gibson), a former Marine and this film�s none-too-subtle version of An Officer and a Gentleman
�s Louis Gossett Jr. Ricocheting between Jake�s panicky drive not to wash out and an emerging romantic subplot with the luminous Jordana Brewster, Annapolis
 elicited groans and the occasional burst of laughter from the audience, thanks to a ham-fisted script from former Family Guy
 writer David Collard that piles on the clich�s one after the other until the whole affair begins to buckle under the weight of its own ironclad silliness. It�s not enough to include the requisite overlong training montage � Lin and Pollard also feel the need to toss in a rogues gallery of boot-camp stereotypes, including the Loudmouth (Calderon), the Crusty Old Salt (Wahlberg), and the Fat Guy Who�s Doomed From the Start (Shannon). Much of this could be forgiven were it not for the singular fact that, as the film�s centerpoint, Franco�s plebe has little resembling a serious backstory or even a sense of motivation beyond the obvious. Why is he here to begin with? "To serve my country," he tells Midshipman Cole. But the line, like the film, has the hollow ring of bullshit that sinks the film like a torpedo to the engine room. Best never to have left dry dock with this one.


Two James Franco movies in a month? First, "Tristan & Isolde," which you can be forgiven for having missed -- it looked grimy and he was a sourpuss the whole time. And now "Annapolis," which is more entertaining than any Navy recruitment ad ought to be.
Nothing Franco has done in movies has been as astounding as the James Dean he played on TNT, but at least here he's cheered up for the occasion. He plays Jake Huard, an amateur boxer toiling for his father at a Maryland shipyard but with dreams bigger than dock work. He promised his late mother that he'd get into the US Naval Academy. Jake is a long shot. His grades are lacking, for one thing. But after a few recruits don't pan out, he's included as a last-minute addition, and the fun gets underway.
Jake isn't enrolled for five minutes when he discovers that Ali (Jordana Brewster), the woman barking orders at him, is the same dame he just mistook for a hooker at his local watering hole. She'll be his commanding officer and, yes, eventually his girl. Not a minute later does Jake meet the big, bad Midshipman Lieutenant Cole (Tyrese Gibson).
Cole is part Apollo Creed and part Louis Gossett Jr. His job is to help weed out the sissies and corner-cutters, and his cruel approach really boils Jake's blood. But Jake is in a tough position. He's not pulling his weight with his group assignments and is too proud to ask for help. Cole knows it and makes him suffer.
Before Jake can say, "You wanna take this outside," he gets wind of the Navy Brigade Championships, an amateur boxing tournament whose most fearsome competitor is the heavyweight Cole. Guess who starts eating candy bars on slices of Wonder Bread to qualify for Cole's weight class?
Directing "Annapolis" is Justin Lin, whose previous feature was the irresponsible high-school comedy thriller "Better Luck Tomorrow." This second movie is more his speed -- the moral standards, at least, seem handed down from the military. There are a few instructional scenes about Navy codes of behavior, but to write them off as mere advertising is unfair. Lin and the screenwriter Dave Collard take as little of this seriously as they can get away with.
That attitude turns problematic when more than one person in the movie breaks character. A suicide attempt is preposterous. So are the movie's locations. The shipyard looks fake, and, as it happens, I graduated from the Philadelphia private school the film uses for the real Naval Academy. It's an odd stand-in, but it's good to see the school is still ready for its close-ups.
While I could have lived with fewer generic training montages, "Annapolis" is full of astonishingly human characters played by talented actors, namely Chi McBride as the weary Navy boxing coach and Vicellous Shannon as Jake's out-of-shape roommate and, later, his fight manager. Brewster is a pleasure to look at but often hard to hear.
The movie is recycled from parts of "Top Gun" and "An Officer and a Gentleman." But the patchwork is good for Franco's charisma -- it's a rare chance to see he has some. His depressive tendencies take a back seat to cornball romance and the occasional grin.
He's even up for would-be insults from Brewster. "You hook like a girl," she says of his boxing. Is she kidding? Only if that girl is Hilary Swank.
.

         Neither lagging military recruitment nor movie attendance is likely to be helped by "Annapolis," a by-the-numbers underdog drama set at the storied U.S. Naval Academy in the Maryland port of the title. James Franco stars as Jake Huard, an Annapolis shipyard worker who rivets by day and hoists beers with his laborer buddies at night, but has long harbored a notion that he belongs at the imposing military institution just across the water.
 
  Then, to the strains of a clouds-parting music score that practically anoints him, Jake is accepted into the academy, where in his plebe year he encounters unforgiving rules, unwavering brotherhood, an unsparing superior and an unexciting boxing movie. Bizarrely, "Annapolis" isn't a glimpse inside the workings of an officer farm — which might have made for an anthropologically nifty tale — but instead "Rocky" in occasional pressed whites, with Jake's talent in the ring representative of his shot at respect in his company.
 


         






    The story's dramatic buildup is toward the academy's real-life Brigade Championships, a pugilist smackdown in which Jake hopes to waylay Tyrese Gibson's ex-Marine midshipman Lt. Cole, the film's nominal villain but really just your garden variety boot-camp movie hard case. It's a little hard to get worked up over Cole's meanness when the worst thing he does is follow procedure in getting plebes kicked out over a rule infraction or for failing a physical test, but Gibson goes for bad-guy broke anyway in a performance composed almost entirely of steely glares.
 
  The director is Justin Lin, whose stylish, stereotype-disassembling Sundance breakthrough from a few years ago, "Better Luck Tomorrow" — about Asian American high schoolers caught up in very bad things — indicated he might have a future tweaking mainstream genre fare. Better luck tomorrow, indeed, as Lin seems AWOL in his studio debut, giving in to every moldy turn of Dave Collard's script instead of amping the guilty pleasures of a military saga the way, say, a Scott brother would (Tony with the iconic "Top Gun," Ridley with the weird "G.I. Jane").
 
  There's a sublime ridiculousness, for instance, in the pixie-ish Jordana Brewster playing Jake's trainer, especially after Hilary Swank's indelible contributions to female boxing verisimilitude, but Lin avoids making their fraternization anything other than pretty faces filling a frame. "Annapolis" does have one interesting connection to reality in that Franco — a square-shouldered, intense young actor who won acclaim playing James Dean on television — has been something of a stardom plebe himself of late: He's also in theaters showcasing the grimier, tearier side of his brooding talents in the Dark Ages love story "Tristan and Isolde." Although "Annapolis" shows he hasn't fully shed the specter of Dean, as when he imbues leaning against a fridge, hands in his coat pockets, with silent momentousness, Franco is a refreshingly offbeat screen presence and in lighter moments boasts an appealing smile.
 
  He may be someone to watch, but too bad there's little room for emotional spontaneity — acting, in other words — in a rote Hollywood drill such as this.   

If, 90 minutes in, we were holding out hope that Louis Gossett Jr. might kick Richard Gere's sorry ass out of the Navy already, would An Officer and a Gentleman still have connected? Probably not. Basic-training dramas, a diverting genre, work because they ultimately pit right against right: It doesn't seem quite fair that Gere has to do all those sit-ups, but then again, it's the military and Gossett's there to play tough. You respect both sides equally, if perhaps grudgingly, and eagerly pull up your seats for the tug-of-war.
Not so, alas, in Annapolis , a military drama that errs big by making its new recruit  a ship-builder named Jake Huard (James Franco) who goes from the wait list into the U.S. Naval Academy  too much the rebel. If you're gonna make a movie about a maverick in a military-school setting, that movie better be Top Gun . Here, Huard's rule  breaking is more exasperating than exhilarating. Compellingly reserved and inscrutable at the start, Franco starts to lose us by the second hour, when his character's still not showing up for roll call on time, and isn't charismatic enough to bring us over to his side. Finally, when  not so far from the end credits  Huard blindsides his commanding officer, the stern-jawed Lieutenant Cole (Tyrese Gibson), for the second time, that's when you start longing for Gossett to pop up and boot this kid out so we can all head home.
Annapolis  manages to hit some nice basic-training movie beats. The best comes when a smiley CO played by Jordana Brewster orders Franco to ''Drop and give me 20!''  exactly what Kelly LeBrock barked at a bunch of dorks in the last scene of Weird Science . The male fantasy lives on.


Blending the hoary conventions of boxing movies into the well-worn basic-training template, "Annapolis" is a slick if not especially novel military recruiting film whose plot is considerably less developed than its leading men's abs. James Franco and Tyrese Gibson scowl and strut and should make the hearts of teenage girls all atwitter, and that's about the only audience that won't see most of the punches telegraphed well in advance. Perhaps every generation needs its own "An Officer and a Gentleman," but Franco's second starring vehicle of early 2006 should be more of a middleweight, box office-wise.
Jake Huard (Franco) has grown up across the water from the prestigious U.S. Naval Academy, driving rivets into the hulls of ships by day and boxing at night. And while his dad (Brian Goodman) doesn't expect much more from him, Jake gets the opportunity to fulfill his late mother's dreams when he's offered late admission into the academy's grueling officer program.
Jake is fine in the brawn department, but he's a little short on brains -- the exact opposite of his pudgy roommate, derisively nicknamed Twins (Vicellous Shannon), who's a whiz at the books but can't clear the wall on that damn obstacle course. Both are thus subjected to their share of dehumanizing abuse, with the toughest instructor, Midshipman Lt. Cole (Gibson), training his sights on Jake, who receives support from another superior among his overseers, Ali (Jordana Brewster).
Drifting along like a traditional basic-training film with at best a half-metal jacket, "Annapolis" takes a turn in the second half as Jake begins training for the Brigades, a boxing competition that will potentially afford him a shot at the merciless Cole. This is previewed fairly early on, as the trainees are thrown into the ring to prove their mettle. Although the Brigades are a longstanding tradition at the academy, all this plays more like a plot contrivance than a test of character.
Franco, also featured in Fox's period release "Tristan & Isolde," is certainly in great shape, and he's convincing enough as a hard-knocks, blue-collar youth learning to rely on others while being toughened and molded by a starched African-American drill instructor. At one point, he even protests, "I'm not quitting!" It's just that somehow, it feels as if someone has made this movie before.
The strongest element in Dave Collard's script, in fact, sparks to life thanks largely to the performance of Shannon, who is both funny and occasionally touching as Twins. Shipped off to Annapolis from a small town that feted him with a parade, he dreads the prospect of not making the cut.
Brewster, by contrast, simply looks as if she parachuted in from a shampoo commercial -- a degree of license tolerable in most movies that's conspicuous and incongruous in this spartan environment. Then again, the Jake-Ali relationship is all tease, since fraternization between plebes and their superiors is strictly prohibited. Otherwise, the pic is notable for its diversity in casting, with Roger Fan and Wilmer Calderon rounding out Jake's roommates.
Director Justin Lin (who made his solo debut with "Better Luck Tomorrow," starring Fan) exhibits considerable proficiency in shooting the boxing sequences, where the work by the sound technicians is especially impressive, making every blow crackle as if it had landed on the skull of the person sitting next to you.
Still, the instructors consistently stress to their charges that the class is only as strong as its weakest plebe. Judging "Annapolis" by its most appealing
 attributes (among all the cliches): It's not bad superficially, but neither is it all that it could be.

Overachievement may go down as Justin Lin 's great subjectif only he weren't a superlative case study. First his muddled Goodfellas  satire Better Luck Tomorrow  got a pass as a boon to Asian Americans in the movies, and now Annapolis  , his often laughably overwrought rehash of An Officer and a Gentleman , ekes out enough of a subtext on competition to qualify as a non-fiasco. At any rate, this is probably the first time a commanding officer has taunted his recruit with the line "Ooohh, I forgot. You're a wait-lister ." James Franco  is Jake Huard , a low-scoring Annapolis, Maryland , native who escapes a destiny of factory work by joining the navy across the way. Lin once again pushes the issue of minorities to the foreground, but his blunt schematicsJake's three roommates all have different ethnicities; his superior (Tyrese Gibson ) is black; and his instructor cum love interest (Jordana Brewster ) is a womanhardly play as gritty realism, and Iraq 's absence from the equation seems flat-out craven. Eventually, Jake's desire to make it in the academy boxing championship transforms Annapolis  into a pugilist picture, with Jake forced to swallow his pride and ask girly Brewster to train him. It's a marginally subversive moment in a movie that otherwise falls in line.
