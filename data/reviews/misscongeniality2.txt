''Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous" closes with the standard outtake reel. Usually the compilation of bloopers, omitted improvisations, and flubs are a strategy to erase the memory of a bad movie. The laughless outtakes for ''Armed and Fabulous" helpfully remind us that it could have been worse.
Sandra Bullock reprises her role as Gracie Hart, the unpolished, New York-based FBI agent, who in the 2000 original went undercover in a beauty pageant to foil a terrorist plot. She appears to be having a good time in this sequel, which gets a lot of mileage from Bullock's enthusiasm, but she can't completely wake up the movie, either.
In the first movie, the pageant made Hart a national celebrity, and now she can no longer fight crime anonymously. The movie opens with Gracie and her FBI cohorts trying to stop a gang of felonious housewives from knocking off a bank, but the star-struck patrons give her away. Even the robbers know who she is.
Her superiors don't want Gracie's fame botching future jobs, but they also recognize that her boundless female fan base represents a public-relations opportunity. So they offer to send her around the country as the face of the FBI. Vulnerable from a recent breakup, she accepts. And after 10 months under the queer eye of a personal stylist, Joel (Diedrich Bader), Gracie is transformed (again) into a shiny, happy celebrity. (Gracie's original makeover guru, Michael Caine, is a no-show; we're informed that his character was hit by a bus.)
Where the first movie's comedy came from the friction between Gracie's butch demeanor and the girly-girl she was posing as, this sequel gives her the full Stepford, with Gracie saying several times, ''I'll be whoever you want me to." And so she becomes a diva. Gracie can now quote Louis Vuitton, uses Fendi luggage, and goes everywhere with Joel and his beauty retinue. She appears on ''Live! With Regis and Kelly," and, as part of a personal safety demonstration, even lets someone else kick Mr. Philbin's groin.
But when two of her friends -- the reigning Miss United States (Heather Burns) and the pageant's emcee (William Shatner)-- are kidnapped in Las Vegas, Gracie has to spring into action, though not as an agent but as the FBI's spokeswoman. Her boss (Ernie Hudson) goes so far as to assign an antagonistic fellow agent (Regina King) to be her bodyguard and keep her in line. (King is a pugnacious hoot, and in the film's one sophisticated touch, her character has the same name as the formidable director Sam Fuller.)
Gracie is expected to give press conferences about the kidnapping while the local division, headed by a rigid Treat Williams, does all the legwork. Naturally, she digs for clues, annoys Williams, and after a string of embarrassments is thrown off the case. But as with any movie about rogue agents and cops expulsion is the best thing for justice. Although with ''Armed and Fabulous," it's hardly ideal for original moviemaking.
The stars all seem to be enjoying themselves.In their few scenes, Burns and Shatner are as funny as they were in the original, and it's a pleasure watching Bullock and King fight because we know they'll grow to love each other (albeit platonically) by the end. But the film is assembly-line generic. There seems to be a commercial-break pause around every corner.
Indeed, the director, John Pasquin, has a resume loaded with decades of television shows (''Gimme a Break!," ''thirtysomething," ''George Lopez") and many Tim Allen flicks. He keeps things rolling, but that's about it, which makes him more a traffic cop than a director. And much of the plot is so predictable that the whole thing seems much longer than its 117 minutes.
The tedium compromises numerous sequences, particularly one in which Bullock and King go undercover at a female impersonation show, with King belting ''Proud Mary" as Tina Turner. Anyone who has seen the movie's ads knows it's coming. But, like too much of this movie, the number is so poorly shot, directed, and edited that it's more exciting in the TV spots. Nothing with so many people in drag should feel this draggy.

         Five years ago Sandra Bullock hit her stride with the fun comedy "Miss Congeniality," in which she played a tough, drab-looking but intrepid FBI agent who submits to an elaborate makeover to pose as a contestant after a beauty pageant receives a threat from one of the country's most crazed terrorists. Because it was a hit for Bullock, it's no wonder she would want to make a sequel, but "Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous," which takes up from where the first film left off, is as awful as the original was inspired. "Mixed Up and Tacky" would be a more appropriate subtitle. The only thing clever about this loser is Warner Bros.' decision to release it on a Thursday, thus avoiding higher-profile Friday reviews.
 
  A dreadful script by Marc Lawrence, who co-produced this train wreck with Bullock, finds Bullock's Gracie Hart so famous for foiling that terrorist that she would put Martha Stewart in the shade, and therefore no longer effective as an undercover agent. She is now to become "the face of the FBI" and hit the talk-show circuit to promote her memoirs.
 


         






    Armed with a personal stylist (Diedrich Bader) and his two assistants, Gracie has become a glib full-time glamour-girl celebrity whose sense of entitlement would leave Paris Hilton at the starting gate. Gracie has also been assigned a bodyguard, Sam (Regina King), a transferee from the FBI's Chicago headquarters with anger-management issues that are hazardous to anyone who comes near. To be sure Gracie and Sam will bond under fire, which involves a lot of palaver about the loneliness of strong women.
 
  When Miss United States (Heather Burns) and the pageant's emcee (William Shatner) are kidnapped in Las Vegas and held for a $5-million ransom, the bureau dispatches Gracie and her entourage to Sin City, where she is to do news conference duty.
 
  Of course Gracie is going to disobey orders and play the crime-stopper because Burns' sweet-natured Cheryl is Hart's only real friend.
 
  Setting up this premise proves laborious, but not as terrible as the silly slapstick shenanigans that follow, which include Gracie chasing and tackling someone she is convinced is a Dolly Parton look-alike somehow involved in the kidnapping but, as anyone could guess, it's the real Parton.
 
  "Armed and Fabulous" swiftly lapses into travesty but without any of the sense of fun that travesty can sometimes offer. In other words, the film has a number of campy elements — Bader's stylist, a drag show, fancy costumes, exuberantly vulgar Vegas settings — but is not remotely funny enough to work as camp. John Pasquin directs as if he were directing traffic, but under the circumstances that may well be all he could be expected to have done.
 
  Bullock has an ingrained likability that has served her well through the thick and thin of her career, but it's not nearly enough to save "Miss Congeniality 2." In fact, there is an atypical strained quality to her acting here that suggests a desperation on her part to make the movie work against all odds. Unfortunately, there's nothing congenial about it.

Sandra Bullock is a cutie. She's also an odd size, by which I mean that her very American onscreen persona  pal/girlfriend, tomboy/glamour-puss, gawky outsider/good-time longneck swigger  requires special care to keep all the pieces in balance. Not surprisingly for such a hyphenate (I'd also add comedienne/tragedienne), Bullock's movies are wildly hit-or-miss affairs, as apt to be tonally off (Murder by Numbers , Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood ) as to be on the money (While You Were Sleeping  and, of course, Speed ).
Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous  isn't exactly good  like Legally Blonde 2 , it's a more exaggerated, less buoyant sequel to what should have been a one-off comedy  but it's an enjoyable (or at least educational) study of what Bullock and her favored writer-producer Marc Lawrence have rightly identified as the star's best comedy assets. (The two worked together on Forces of Nature , the original, unexpectedly delightful Miss Congeniality , and the undervalued Two Weeks Notice , in which Bullock and her male equal in the romantic-comedy school of I-charm-alone, Hugh Grant, combusted on screen like a house on fire.)
Once again, Bullock plays FBI agent Gracie Hart, who appears to have kept the eyebrow grooming skills she previously acquired while going undercover as a beauty pageant contestant but ditched the rest of the upgrade; Gracie still snorts when she laughs, spills when she eats, and trips when she walks, and she's back to her butch FBI wardrobe. She's famous now, though  too much so for undercover work, but exactly famous enough to suit up in pretty skirts and relearn gracious manners to represent ''the face of the FBI'' (with The Drew Carey Show 's Diedrich Bader taking up the homosexual-stylist slot vacated by Michael Caine). And once again, Gracie fights to establish her own personal definition of femininity by throwing off the constrictions of ladylike behavior, this time in the course of rescuing a couple of old pageant pals (Heather Burns and hammy William Shatner reprising their Congeniality  roles) who have been kidnapped in Las Vegas.
The Vegas setting results in some of the movie's most tired capers (the draggiest of which is a performance in a drag club). The update devised for Bullock's persona, though, as an actress who's more acceptable to audiences as a chick who wants a man than as a chick who has one, is a sharp improvement. Gracie's partner this time is a tough fellow lady-agent named Sam, with a big chip on her shoulder and a powerful pair of fists  she's the opposite of a dull, kissable Benjamin Bratt-type hunk. Played by the redoubtable Regina King, Sam makes Gracie look girly in contrast. Paired together, the two women hint at the start of a beautiful comedy relationship, and new ways to let Bullock be Bullock.

ading through this junky sequel to her genial goofball hit "Miss Congeniality," Sandra Bullock looks as if she would rather be shoveling pig waste - though of course in some respects that is exactly what she's doing. Set a mere three weeks after the first film, which was released in 2000, "Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous" finds Ms. Bullock as the charmingly clumsy F.B.I. agent, Gracie Hart, vainly fending off unwanted celebrity. On her last assignment, Gracie infiltrated a beauty pageant by metamorphosing from duckling to swan, a mission that earned her legions of female fans across the country. After Gracie's cover is blown during a bank heist, endangering her and every other undercover agent on her team, the powers that be decide that she should become "the face of the F.B.I." Gracie, hurt after being dumped by a romantic prospect (the agent played in the first go around by Benjamin Bratt, wisely nowhere to be seen or heard here), agrees to the reassignment on the tenuous grounds that flouncing about in designer threads is better for her soul and career than pushing pencils. And so, after a consult with the obligatory swishy style guru, Joel (Diedrich Bader), Gracie undergoes yet another transformation, one designed to strip every ounce of charm and integrity from her character. Clarice Starling, meet Paris Hilton. Usually an effervescent screen presence, Ms. Bullock turns in a performance as flat as day-old Champagne. It's hard not to blame her, particularly given the shoddy work by both the screenwriter Marc Lawrence, who helped write the first "Miss Congeniality," and the director John Pasquin, whose previous crimes against cinema include the Tim Allen vehicle "The Santa Clause." It isn't just that "Miss Congeniality 2" is nearly absent a single genuine laugh; it's that instead of a screenplay and a story we now have stereotypes and sketch comedy. In place of screwball heroics and wish-fulfillment the filmmakers give us jokes about tampons and some curious gender unease, particularly between Gracie and an angry female agent with the abominably cutesy name of Sam Fuller. Played by the talented actress Regina King, Agent Fuller spends much of the movie smacking Gracie around really, really hard, a peculiar tic that only becomes more peculiar as the movie dribbles along. In between the feeble glimmerings of a plot and a hailstorm of body blows, the two women develop a grudging admiration for each other that should by the logic of the clich�s both women have assumed - Sam's all man, Gracie's all girl - led into an intimate clinch. Alas, this particular wish is not to be fulfilled. Instead, the sub rosa romance between Gracie and Sam is quashed in favor of way too many uneasy, unfunny jokes pegged to gay men. As it turns out, being fabulous is far more dangerous for a woman (and a movie star) than being armed. "Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). The film includes some ostensibly humorous gunplay, a lot of casual physical violence and crudely juvenile humor.

Arriving a protracted four years plus after its original mined serious B.O. gold, commercially savvy "Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous" follows the original's blueprint, balances action and comedy routines, and keeps Sandra Bullock front and center as goofball FBI sleuth Gracie Hart. As pallid as the first edition's comedy was, its beauty pageant gimmick had advantages over the new pic's strained mission in Vegas, which recycles nearly every hackneyed Sin City bit imaginable. Lame and inoffensive, Hart's latest adventure looks assured of solid nine-figure worldwide numbers, which could prompt a third entry for Bullock's franchise.
Despite the fame Hart earned from saving the life of Miss United States (Heather Burns' Cheryl) in first pic, she's still out in the field as an FBI agent. In action that proceeds opening credits, Hart's public visibility nearly screws up the arrest of a ring of female bank robbers.
Her boss McDonald (Ernie Hudson) realizes Hart is too recognizable to continue working as a field agent and assigns her to be "the face of the FBI" as part of a PR charm offensive. The need for this is never justified, however, and it plays as a weak gimmick to give Hart's character a makeover.
The new Hart emerges 10 months later as a spoiled celeb-author promoting her bestseller on the chatshow circuit and trailed by a posse including gay stylist Joel (Diedrich Bader) and a churlish and sour agent/bodyguard with a mean violent streak aptly named -- in a joke sure to elude many younger auds -- Sam Fuller (Regina King). For a woman who didn't want to be "the FBI's Barbie," Hart appears to enjoy the limelight, but between this unattractive spoof on celebrity and Hart's tiresomely repetitive run-ins with Fuller, "Armed and Fabulous" seems armed only for self-destruction.
Soon after catching up with Cheryl and affably dumb pageant emcee Stan (William Shatner) on the set of Regis Philbin's show, Hart learns that Cheryl and Stan have been kidnapped. Myopically assuming that Hart won't get involved in the FBI's investigation, McDonald sends Hart and Fuller off on a silly Vegas PR stunt.
With so much strained and unpromising setup material -- including the embarrassing spectacle of her chasing and tackling Dolly Parton in the Venetian Hotel -- Bullock stays as charming as possible.
Things get a bit more grounded with Treat Williams' all-business Collins as the bureau's Vegas topper and Enrique Murciano as Foreman, the agent assigned as Hart's handler. Of course, as is now the franchise's formula, it's the last agent in the world whom anybody takes seriously -- namely, Hart -- who makes deductive leaps that would daunt the most veteran of Cirque du Soliel acrobats.
Screenwriter Marc Lawrence (one of the original's three co-writers, credited here solo) has a habit for allowing space for physical antics and then needing to play catch-up in the plot department by having Hart suddenly whirl into action. These repeated mechanics felt tiresome the first time around with director Donald Petrie, and they're just as tiresome this time with John Pasquin ("Joe Somebody") at the helm.
But Bullock is game and gives every appearance of having just discovered her character. Though she seems unsure in early reels of how to spoof Hart-as-celebrity (and thus, herself), she regains her grip and her naturally likable instincts as a performer and wins aud's hearts and minds. A scene where she's disguised as a retiree gives her a nice theatrical break to try out some comic vocals and behavior, so it's a pity that it's nearly ruined by bad makeup.
Her returning support -- Hudson, Shatner and Burns -- pick up where they left off. Burns, though, is literally tied up most of her screentime and given almost no room to show her comic gifts. King, who appears primed to be Hart's buddy in a third pic, struggles making her sour demeanor feel more than just sour, while Murciano struggles to make any impression at all.
Production package is a bit more enhanced than original, but not overly so. Credits appear only at the end, and curiously note topline composers Christophe Beck and Randy Edelman with below-the-line "additional music."

Will the circle be unbroken? Let's hope not. This poorly conceived sequel to Gore Verbinski 's The Ring  ditches that film's scariest conceitpeople die a week after watching . . . an avant-garde video! for a watery possession plot. Fleeing the gnarliness unleashed in the first movie's Seattle  for small-town life, Rachel (Naomi Watts ) and her weird little son (David Dorfman ) have to fend off bad plumbing, angry deer, and the unshowered ghost girl who keeps ruining his digital photos. Postpartum depression is invoked several times; if the name of the game is to be the unheimlich  maneuvers of the mother-child bond, one wishes Hideo Nakata  (director of the Japanese Ringu  films) could have nudged the proceedings toward the Rosemary's Baby -Birth  axis. (Indeed, there's a brief, wordless melody intended to evoke RB .) Sissy Spacek , as the would-be Andrea Yates  now in the loony bin, is thankfully obscured by a long wig. The let's-travel-through-the-TV-screen sequence was better in Fat Albert  . Next time we'll try call-waiting.
