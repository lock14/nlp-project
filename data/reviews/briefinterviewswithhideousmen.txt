David Foster Wallace's 1999 short-story collection Brief Interviews With Hideous Men  has been turned  by writer-director John Krasinski (The Office )  into a blunt, scrappy, intermittently perceptive drama. It's a series of toxic-pill relationship vignettes broken up by interviews with the male characters, most of whom prove, beneath their ''enlightened'' liberal-humanist facades, to be lying, lecherous, brutally self-justifying...men.   At times, the movie could have been called Me and You and   Every One of the Bastards We Know , but Krasinski preserves Wallace's whooshing roller coasters of words, powered by the fuel of confession.

 What do men want? This reversal of Freud’s famous question drives John Krasinski’s screen adaptation of David Foster Wallace’s 1999 short-story collection “Brief Interviews With Hideous Men” into a blind alley. Compacted into an 80-minute mishmash of interviews, confessions and sketches, melded into a shaky mosaic, the answers from a cross section of men are shallow, self-serving and ultimately unenlightening.  “Brief Interviews” may be verbally dexterous and enthusiastically acted by the likes of Timothy Hutton, Christopher Meloni, Denis O’Hare, Ben Shenkman, Michael Cerveris and Bobby Cannavale. But its composite portrait of the male psyche in the post-feminist era is repellent. Beyond the characters’ desire to know what women want and how to use it to their advantage, there is no unifying motif connecting the fragments.  In the minds of the smug few who imagine they have the answers to Freud’s original question, what women want is to be controlled by men who assume they have mastered the mechanics of seduction and sexual technique. The other subjects who have no such illusions are self-absorbed, deluded combatants adrift on the sexual battlefield.  “Brief Interviews” is the directorial debut of Mr. Krasinski, who plays Jim Halpert in the American version of “The Office,” and who also appears in the film as Ryan, the ex-boyfriend of a female interviewer. Anonymous in Wallace’s book, the interviewer has a name, Sara Quinn (Julianne Nicholson), in the film. An  attractive doctoral candidate in anthropology at an East Coast university, she has been recently dumped by Ryan, and her project is partly a quest to understand what happened.  Many of the interviewees are assigned numbers and sit at a desk in front of a white concrete wall with a pitcher of water and a cassette recorder nearby and respond to questions that have been asked before the camera rolls. Sara remains off screen during the sessions but appears in scenes set at gatherings on and off campus, where she hovers, an unseen observer of male behavior. Even in a confrontation with Ryan near the end of the film, she barely speaks, as he rationalizes his fling with a hippie mystic.  The movie begins on a glaringly heavy-handed note with a subject (Mr. Shenkman) who describes his self-destructive compulsion to shout, “Victory for  the forces of democratic freedom!” at the top of his lungs during orgasm.  There follows a succession of cads and losers of various stripes. A swaggering stud (Mr. Cannavale), who is missing most of his right arm, crows about how he uses his “asset” to seduce women by making them weep with sympathy. In the most incendiary confrontation Daniel (Dominic Cooper), an angry student of Sara’s, furiously argues that abuse and rape can be good for a woman, because they “enlarge” her experience of the world.  The film’s one eloquent moment is the only monologue not devoted to sexual game playing. A middle-aged black man (Frankie R. Faison), standing in the men’s room in the lobby of the luxury hotel where his father (Malcolm Goodwin) worked for decades as an attendant, imagines his father’s humiliating daily routine. If anyone in the film could be called a hero, it is this attendant, who silently appears as his son reminisces with a mixture of shame and grudging admiration.  Privy to the unsanitary bathroom habits and miserly tipping practices of countless wealthy businessmen for whom he provided soap and towels, this humble, uncomplaining man, immaculately dressed in white, and all but invisible to the world, is the film’s ultimate witness to men’s grubby little secrets.

"Brief Interviews With Hideous Men" reps a misguided attempt to shift some raw, if rarefied, ideas about the battle of the sexes from the printed page to the bigscreen. Thesp John Krasinski ("The Office") has adapted a book by the late literary wunderkind David Foster Wallace into what largely amounts to a collection of monologues of men disclosing their innermost thoughts about women to Sara (Julianne Nicholson), who has been jilted by Krasinski's character. It's a very academic movie about academics that belongs in academia, not movie theaters. Piece as written might prove more successful as an Off-Broadway-style play.
Much of the film consists of men -- identified as Subject #14, Subject #72 and so on -- sitting in front of a white brick wall and relating intimate thoughts to their inquisitor, whose inquiry is motivated by her need to understand why her boyfriend dumped her. Action moves to cafes, parties and elsewhere from time to time, and the most dynamic figure onscreen is Dominic Cooper's Daniel, who challenges Sara with some disturbing theories about abuse and victimhood. Pic has an elegant but very chilly nature.


"Everything I write ends up being about loneliness," said the late writer David Foster Wallace  in a 1999 interview on the radio show "Bookworm." In that conversation, Wallace was trying to get at the core of his Brief Interviews With Hideous Men , a four-part short story he wrote as a series of monologues, which, in turn, are presented as a transcription of interviews that an unnamed woman conducted with dozens of men. In a dizzying whirl of language, Wallace's fictional men explain how they feel about the women they've loved or, more often than not, have failed to love.
The 29-year-old actor John Krasinski  reports that participating in a staged reading of Wallace's story while a Brown University  student inspired him to pursue acting as a profession. In the years since, as he rose to fame in The Office  , he has been developing the stories as a feature, which he would write and direct. The resulting film has clearly been made with a deep reverence for Wallace, who was surely the most gifted writer of his generation, and who took his own life one year ago this month, at age 46. All of which makes it even more painful to say that, as a film, Brief Interviews With Hideous Men  is a disaster.
In his crazily ambitious adaptation, Krasinski has brought to life the female interviewer, who is invisible in Wallace's stories. On-screen, she has become Sara (Julianne Nicholson ), a New York grad student who asks the men around her to speak about their relationships with women. At first, the talks take place in a bunker-like room, with the men sitting at a table in front of an ugly concrete wall. Krasinski begins with Subject #14 (Ben Shenkman ), who has a goofy sexual problem. He is followed by one other (a funny Michael Cerveris  as a blue-collar worker with performance issues), and then, as if he can't stand the idea of staring at that bleak gray wall for the length of a film (an 80-minute one, at that), Krasinski sends Sara out into the world, where men at restaurants, parties, and theaters begin telling their stories, sometimes to her face, sometimes not.
The effect is distractingly theatrical—and confusing. Sara leaves her apartment and passes a man (Will Arnett ) in the hallway, who is delivering a monologue about abandonment through the closed door of his girlfriend's apartment. That's a clever enough idea on paper, perhaps, but the setup ends up undercutting the message—his words don't land. Later, in a coffeehouse, Sara listens from two tables away as a businessman (Christopher Meloni ) tells his friend (Denis O'Hare ) about an odd, Cheever-esque encounter he had with a newly jilted, hysterically crying woman in an airport. Ever in search of a way to open up the film, Krasinski cuts away to a poorly executed flashback of the encounter, set to Meloni's voiceover. Again, excess staging overwhelms content, and all is lost.
It's easy to see why actors would be drawn to Wallace's Hideous Men  monologues: They're funny, profane, often scarily intense, and, at all times, deeply emotional. Yet, Wallace was not writing a play. He was writing fiction. For the page. And so the plot specifics of each man's story—the who, what, and where—are secondary to the clutter of language with which the men surround their testimony. Wallace used language—often ornately academic—as a kind of protective padding for his interviewees, and the reader, at his own pace, must dig deep to find the essential truths.
Filmmakers, even great ones, are always battling the clock, a dilemma that left Krasinski little choice but to cut each monologue down to its core events. The stilted storytelling that results often rings false, and in the end, the monologues—delivered by some very good actors (Timothy Hutton , Bobby Cannavale , Josh Charles ), who come across as first-year theater students acting out scenes from their favorite novels—don't add up to much. If Krasinski had an overarching theme in mind—be it the loneliness that Wallace spoke of, or something else—we're not getting it. And whatever it was about Hideous Men  that so deeply affected Krasinski the college student has been lost in translation.
