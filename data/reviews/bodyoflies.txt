DiCaprio and Crowe make for interesting friends and foils in Scott's new geopolitical thriller. They represent the polar extremes of the types of operatives running the plays in today's counterassault on global terrorism. DiCaprio plays Roger Ferris, a lone CIA operative on the ground in the Middle East who ferrets out intelligence that he hopes will lead to big fish Al-Saleem (Aboutboul), an Osama bin Laden-like figure whose jihadist group has claimed responsibility for most of the world's most recent terrorist bombings. Ferris speaks the local language and strives to blend in, yet he also puts his body on the line with a physicality that almost borders on masochism. (The brutish torture he undergoes at one point is almost unendurable to watch.) His movements on the ground are meanwhile observed in real time through an array of modern media devices by his handler, Ed Hoffman (Crowe). Overhead images from aerial drones track Ferris on his missions with a precision that makes us not only marvel at the sophistication of American technology but also wonder how, despite the advantage of all this technical wizardry, Americans could possibly lose any battle they waged. Crowe, who put on lots of extra poundage for this role, plays Hoffman as a paunchy company man who conducts the war on terrorism from the comfort of his living room. Always watching Ferris on some TV screen and monitoring his actions through constant cell-phone contact, Hoffman issues orders while simultaneously potty training his kids or dropping them off at school. The contrasts between the two men could not be more pronounced, yet they share a collegial friendship and the belief that everyone is expendable � that is until Ferris develops a love connection with a woman (Farahani) in Jordan. This love story seems totally grafted onto an otherwise taut story (scripted by William Monahan from a novel by Washington Post
 columnist David Ignatius). It's a trite motivational device that seems out of place here. Black Hawk Down
 director Scott again demonstrates his expertise at mounting a topical thriller and also his impressive command of spatial relationships and structures, an ability already on display in such early films as Alien
 and Blade Runner
. DiCaprio and Crowe, who both deliver excellent performances, may nevertheless be overshadowed by the outstanding turn by British actor Strong as the impeccably tailored and exacting Jordanian head of security, Hani Salaam. Despite the terrific acting and storytelling skills evident here, Body of Lies
 remains strangely emotionless. There's little offered in the form of rooting interests or compassionate characterizations, making the film ultimately as ephemeral as its title.


In "Body of Lies," Leonardo DiCaprio sports an undergrowth of facial hair so mossy and unkempt I thought I'd stumbled into an early screening of Steven Soderbergh's "Che." The star is playing Roger Ferris, our CIA agent on the ground in the Middle East, and the scruff is supposed to help him blend in with the locals. It's also meant, I think, to give DiCaprio some visual gravitas - to make him look like a man among men. Perversely, it makes him seem barely postadolescent. Even more perversely, this helps the movie.
"Body of Lies" is based on a novel by journalist David Ignatius and directed by the estimable stylist Ridley Scott. The movie is an urgent current-events thriller that falls somewhere between "Syriana" and the "Bourne" movies. It's a genre film - the action is fierce and nonstop - with a brooding undercurrent of unease that aims for the complexities of John le Carre.
Complexity, in fact, is the subject: Those characters who can grasp the nuances of Middle East realpolitik are the film's heroes. Those who see it through the filter of ideology - any ideology - are the villains. Ferris is caught in the middle, an honorable but flawed hero owned by a bankrupt spook culture.
The audience? We're on our own, which is fine if you've followed the news and can keep up with the spinning datelines (Iraq, Amman, Dubai, the Netherlands, Langley), less so if it's all one big Arab muddle to you. The two women sitting next to me in the screening spent most of the running time loudly wondering where we were now; I wanted to hand them an atlas and tell them to shut up.
The hero's CIA minder is Ed Hoffman, Near East section head, played by Russell Crowe with the doughy comic certainty of the boss in "Dilbert." As Ferris heads to Jordan to dig out an Al Qaeda nest, one that hopefully leads to a nefarious Osama-style jihadist (Alon Aboutboul), he's never sure whether Hoffman is using him in a larger game.
The joke is that Hoffman's always playing a larger game - it's what gets him up in the morning. Crowe gives this D.C.-based suit a deliciously Machiavellian spin. We see him sending his kids off to school while chatting blithely with the frustrated Ferris via earpiece, and the disconnect - from his home life, from events in Amman, from common morality - is frighteningly funny.
Hoffman's opposite number is Hani Pasha (British actor Mark Strong), head of the Jordanian secret police and a smooth customer (he habitually calls Ferris "my dear") with a masterful command of political intricacies. Dedicated to capturing the terrorists, he's a foxy strategist who knows when to use force and when to use persuasion; all he asks is that Ferris be truthful with him. The drama in "Body of Lies" deals with how much truth the hero can admit to, or how much he even knows.
Scott keeps the film rocketing along, close to the trail here, dashing out to the desert wastes there, looping back to Europe for a terrifying marketplace explosion. Secondary characters zip in and out, trailed by bullets or betrayal. Hovering above the fray like a paranoid's daydream are spy planes that relay high-resolution images back to Langley and Hoffman; entire chunks of the film seem to have been brought to us by Google Earth. The irony is that Ferris's handlers see so much while comprehending so little.
The script adaptation is by William Monahan, and there's a whiff of "The Departed" in the profane crackle of the dialogue. (not to mention DiCaprio's undercover agonizing). "Body of Lies" gets a nice second-act lift when the hero concocts a fake terrorist cell to lure the Al Qaeda mullah out of hiding. Using all the available electronic resources (marshaled by a diffident British wonk played by Simon McBurney), Ferris provides a jihadist identity for an innocent and unsuspecting Jordanian architect (Ali Suliman). These scenes feel like "Mission: Impossible" played with real money, tense because they're so absurdly feasible.
Yet "Body of Lies" is at heart a pulp thriller, no more so than when the gifted Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani turns up as a fetching Amman nurse named Aisha who stitches Ferris's wounds and sets his heart aflutter. No slight to Farahani, but her scenes play like sops to DiCaprio's heartthrob following, a concession to the notion that every movie needs a love interest or we won't pay attention.
Well, no, not really. "Body of Lies" is about the evil that men do - often when they think they're doing good - and the romance between Ferris and Aisha feels like a tacked-on Hollywood diversion. Anyway, the movie's real romance is between Ferris and the silky, brutal Hani. Knowing all and seeing all, the Jordanian seduces the American, but would he seduce us so easily if the role had been cast with an Arab actor? Possibly. Nevertheless, you wonder if Roger Ferris isn't the only person here with stars in his eyes.


Body of Lies  is a terrible title for a globe-trotting espionage drama  it sounds more like a cable-ready ''erotic'' thriller starring Colin Farrell and Madonna. That tacky and meaningless title is a tip-off; it lets us know just how desperate the filmmakers are to please. Body of Lies  has a lot of big, important explosions (whole buildings get blown up), plus the usual cars-barreling-through- the-Third-World-bazaar set pieces and sky-track surveillance shots that invite us to suck in our breath at the awesome telescopic reach of the CIA's omnipresent eye. Yet most of this just seems, you know, so three years ago, so Bourne  again. The director, that veteran big-budget action painter Ridley Scott, huffs and puffs to give a topical undercover scenario the patina of relevance. Really, though, he's fighting the last war  and I don't mean Iraq or Afghanistan, which Scott knows all too well are losers at the box office. I mean the Cold War. Working from a screenplay by William Monahan (The Departed ), which is based on a David Ignatius novel, Scott takes rusty '80s clichés from the days when we were playing nuclear chicken with Russia and retrofits them to the post-9/11 world. He exposes how weary those old spy tropes really are.
Leonardo DiCaprio, with a snaky undergrowth of beard that makes him look like a mandarin Cheshire cat, plays Roger Ferris, a CIA operative who has come as close as anyone in the agency to penetrating the enigmatic thicket of loyalties within the Middle East. Ferris speaks Arabic, and he knows that in the faceless world of international terror, information is king. He is also patched, more or less permanently, into the laptop of Ed Hoffman (Russell Crowe), a middle-aged CIA veteran who now sits around at home in the suburbs, or in his Langley, Va., office, tracking Ferris' movements on a spiffy wall-size monitor. The whole world is at his fingertips, which may be why Hoffman barely bothers to get out of his armchair. Crowe, with a graying bristle cut and 50 added pounds, gives Hoffman a smug drawl, and he spends the movie uttering each line in the same folksy-flat It's all business, son!  voice and peering, again and again, over the top of his officious spectacles. He seems to be phoning in his performance on purpose, which doesn't make it any less rote.
Ferris and Hoffman are out to entrap the mysterious jihadist leader Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul), a bin Laden figure who has left a trail of bombings and videotapes. In Jordan, Ferris makes contact with Hani Salaam (Mark Strong), the head of the country's General Intelligence Department, which primes us for some seriously knotty intrigue. You don't, after all, catch America's most wanted terrorist mastermind by looking him up in the Amman yellow pages. Ferris uses Hani to connect with an informer, who will penetrate a local safe house. But the idea that Al-Saleem could, in fact, be nabbed through a safe house, or that a stray jihadist who ''turned'' could be counted on to expose him, is like a scenario left over from the Brezhnev era, or maybe the age of Casablanca . Mark Strong, the debonair British actor who plays Hani (he's like a taller, more insinuating Andy Garcia), does indeed have glittering hints of Old Hollywood malice pouring through his courtly charm. DiCaprio, by contrast, seems trapped—in that baby face, in his increasing inability to create even a dash of subtext. Ferris is attracted to an Iranian nurse, and nothing the star does makes this more than a laughably generic romance. Maybe it's just the role, but the gifted DiCaprio is starting to come off as a less-than-inspired actor. His heart needs to catch fire again.

 Ridley Scott’s new movie, “Body of Lies,” raises a potentially disturbing question. If terrorism has become boring, does that mean the terrorists have won? Or, conversely, is the grinding tedium of this film good news for our side, evidence of the awesome might of Western popular culture, which can turn even the most intransigent and bloodthirsty real-world villains into fodder for busy, contrived and lifeless action thrillers?  The second answer seems more plausible, but there are other puzzles in “Body of Lies” that are not so easily solved and that may distract from sober contemplation of geopolitical pseudorealities. Such as: what exactly is going on with Leonardo DiCaprio’s accent, or Russell Crowe’s body mass index? Mr. DiCaprio, playing a high-strung C.I.A. operative named Roger Ferris, once again shows his commitment to full employment for dialect coaches, following the mock-Afrikaans of “Blood Diamond” and the South Boston braying of “The Departed” with some good-old-boy inflections that are helpfully identified by Mr. Crowe’s character as originating in North Carolina.  Mr. Crowe, meanwhile, plays Ferris’s supervisor, Ed Hoffman, who lives somewhere around Washington and has no specified regional background to explain his odd little drawl. At times Mr. Crowe, showing the linguistic chameleonism that is the birthright of every Australian actor, spits out his words with an emphatic twanginess that suggests, if not George W. Bush himself, then perhaps Jon Stewart impersonating Mr. Bush. It’s possible that this resemblance is meant to imply a parallel between the president and Hoffman, who  is immune to self-doubt and allergic to second thoughts about the righteousness of his actions.  And also, it appears, to exercise (unlike the president). With an unusual display of impish delight, Mr. Crowe throws himself into the physicality of his character, a schlubby, tubby suburban dad whose near-parodic commitment to domestic routine contrasts amusingly with his professional fanaticism. Using a hands-free cellphone, Hoffman orchestrates elaborate schemes and double-crosses while going about his daily paterfamilias business: loading his kids into the minivan, helping his young son in the bathroom and tearing open a bag of Pepperidge Farm Goldfish crackers on the sidelines of his daughter’s soccer game.  On the phone, and in his occasional surprise visits to Ferris in the field, Hoffman is fighting a war whose terms he lays out in a few set-piece speeches. The gist is that no one is innocent and that the ends justify the means. Deceit, torture, the sacrifice of non-American lives — all is permissible in the fight against a shadowy superjihadist named Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul), head of a network carrying out suicide attacks around Europe. The contradictions and unintended consequences of Hoffman’s tactics are borne by Ferris, who finds his credibility undermined, his friends and colleagues at risk and his life in danger.  All of which would be fine if “Body of Lies” — with a screenplay by William Monahan (“The Departed”) and based on a novel by David Ignatius, a columnist at The Washington Post — were clearer about its themes or its plot. As it is, the movie is a hodgepodge of borrowings and half-cooked ideas, flung together into a feverishly edited jet-setting exercise in purposeless intensity. Place names flash onto the screen — Amman! Amsterdam! Langley! — and shiny black S.U.V.’s  and Mercedes sedans screech through teeming streets or kick up dust clouds on empty desert roads. From time to time an orange fireball erupts, and everything shows up on the satellite surveillance screens back at headquarters.  In Jordan, Ferris flirts with Aisha (Golshifteh Farahani), an Iranian refugee who works as a nurse and who has even less of an organic relation to the narrative than poor Vera Farmiga did in “The Departed.” The dramatic — I daresay the erotic — center of “Body of Lies” is an all-male triangle involving Ferris, Hoffman and Hani (Mark Strong), the head of Jordanian intelligence. Mr. Strong, also seen in the similar and superior “Syriana,” is a marvel of exotic suavity and cool insinuation. Hani calls Ferris “my dear” and may be more sincere in his affection than the ideologically driven Hoffman, who refers to his younger colleague more generically as “buddy.”  If the psychological tensions linking these three were allowed time and space to develop, “Body of Lies” might have been a more surprising and interesting specimen of its genre. Instead, it throws out a few gestures toward topicality — an opening quote from the W. H. Auden poem  that flew around the Internet just after 9/11; glances toward Gitmo and the Green Zone; an awkward dinner-table spat about American foreign policy — without saying much of anything. Mr. Scott’s professionalism is, as ever, present in every frame and scene, but this time it seems singularly untethered from anything like zeal, conviction or even curiosity.  “Body of Lies” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has swearing and graphic violence.

Neither the location-based verisimilitude of Ridley Scott's shooting style nor the estimable Middle East expertise of source-material author David Ignatius can disguise "Body of Lies" as anything other than the contrived phony-baloney it is. Coming on like an inside account of CIA operations against jihad-minded terrorists, pic shows its true colors by featuring a shootout, chase or big explosion every 10 minutes or so, on its way to a climax so conventional it would have been at home in a 1940s Warner Bros. melodrama. Despite the Iraq War hovering in the background, Leonardo DiCaprio and Russell Crowe leading the charge in a high-octane would-be thriller should produce solid mainstream B.O. worldwide. 
Due to Scott's clear interest in West vs. Arab conflict, explored in both "Black Hawk Down" and "Kingdom of Heaven," novelist and journalist Ignatius' intimate knowledge of the scene and scenarist William Monahan's proven skill with complicated narratives and pungent dialogue, there was reason here to hope for something more than an updated companion piece to Ridley's brother Tony's 2001 espionage meller "Spy Game."
The setup certainly has merit. A dedicated Arabist and fluent in the language, rough-and-tumble CIA op Roger Ferris (DiCaprio) works the treacherous streets of the Middle East, be it in Iraq, Jordan or Syria, trying to recruit help, infiltrate cells and uncover plots against steep odds. His boss back in Langley, Ed Hoffman (Crowe), is a blunt realist who admits that a democracy is "an easy target" and that it wouldn't be all that hard to bring Western civilization down.
Better yet, the story hinges on an ingenious plot hatched by Ferris to flush out a shadowy master terrorist who's embarked upon a series of devastating bombings against civilian targets but never steps forward to take credit: Ferris creates an entirely fictitious rival terror organization whose atrocities and unknown leader are designed to force the real perpetrator far enough into the open for apprehension.
Sounds like a can't-miss premise. But Scott and Monahan, who teamed on "Kingdom of Heaven," take a mostly formulaic approach that becomes more disappointing as the yarn unwinds, right up to the cornball denouement that is everything that even some internal dialogue had promised it wouldn't be.
Working in similar rugged-modern-adventurer mode as he did in "Blood Diamond," DiCaprio frequently gets roughed up and bloodied, to the point where his character even seems to like it. As he tries to ferret out a potential informant in the Iraqi desert or to run surveillance on a terrorist safe house in Amman, Ferris is observed by Hoffman via crisp overhead images provided by high-flying drones. Given the technology at hand, it seems surprising the CIA doesn't enjoy a higher success rate than it appears to.
But as Hoffman himself best articulates, terrorists can flourish by going no-tech, relying on quiet person-to-person communications. This is where Ferris proves invaluable, at least to the extent that Hoffman permits him to function on his own terms.
Conflict between Ferris' micro approach and Hoffman's concern for the macro surfaces in their respective dealings with Jordanian intelligence chief Hani Salaam (Mark Strong). An urbane and elegant sophisticate, Hani chafes at Hoffman's crudeness but quickly recognizes Ferris' smarts and agrees to cooperate with his efforts to nail Islamist mastermind Al-Saleem (Alon Aboutboul). Scenes between Ferris and Hani possess a heightened vibrance stemming from two sharp, skillful men recognizing their respective qualities and working out a mutually beneficial modus operandi.
At one point some nasty wounds land Ferris in the hospital, where he is ministered to by lovely nurse Aisha (Iranian thesp Golshifteh Farahani). Pic is attentive to the extreme cultural difficulties of even the most modest social exchanges between an American man and a Muslim woman under such circumstances; men glare at them when they share tea at a public cafe, and Aisha's conservative sister (Lubna Azabal) gives Ferris an earful when he comes for lunch.
Despite the sociopolitical points of interest and even insight, however, the scenario begins to feel contorted and ultimately poisoned by its adherence to movie conceits rather than real-world terms; the film capitulates to what it's thought audiences want from Hollywood action cinema, rather than going its own original way with material that could have been far more absorbing and provocative. No matter how credible and realistic the urban and countryside scenes may look (many Morocco locations doubled for the numerous Middle Eastern locales represented), what takes place in them comes off as increasingly hokey and concocted. In the end, "Body of Lies" infuses the thriller format with hot modern issues less successfully than did last year's "The Kingdom."
DiCaprio throws himself into the middle of dangerous doings much as he did in "Blood Diamond" and "The Departed," that is to say with grit, determination and an underlying need to prove something. Strong makes a marked impression as the cultivated Jordanian spy boss, Farahani brings spirit to a standard role and Simon McBurney adds another eccentric to his resume as a nerdy computer genius.
And then there's Russell Crowe. Asked by Scott to put on 50 pounds for the role of the Cofer Black-like CIA figure, the actor has clearly obliged, to the point where he now looks like a candidate to succeed the late, great JT Walsh as a specialist in beefy, menacing supporting characters. Sporting cropped salt-and-pepper hair and an Arkansas accent, Crowe literally phones this one in -- as perhaps half his performance is spent speaking by cell phone to DiCaprio overseas; the other half has him peering over reading glasses to make his point. It would be nice to see this great actor toughen up again and take on some more challenging roles.
Tech qualities are on a par with Scott's usual high standards, with the director's longtime camera operator-second unit director and cameraman Alexander Witt making his debut as a full d.p.

A new kind of war movie for a new kind of war, Body of Lies  is about the War on Terror as it is being waged on the ground, in the air, but most of all in cyberspace. Directed with terrific verve by Ridley Scott  (coming after the listless American  Gangster ) from a smart screenplay by William Monahan  (writer of The Departed ), the movie follows the flow of strategic information from BlackBerrys  to satellites to the 21st-century war rooms where all the world—seen from above on a wide-screen jumbotron—resembles one giant video game. Forget about nuclear launch codes and glass-encased detonators; here, Armageddon is just an e-mail—or a text message—away. Control-alt-delete: You're dead.
Call it "terror porn" (as one colleague has amusingly dubbed the entire wave of recent Hollywood  espionage movies) if you must. Like Syriana , The Kingdom ,  and Rendition , Body of Lies  begins with a healthy dollop of post-9/11 relevance, as an Arab terrorist blows himself (and an entire block of Manchester, England ) to smithereens just as the police move in to nab him. A bearded bin Laden  surrogate—here a Syrian-born, American-educated guru named Al-Saleem (Israeli actor Alon Aboutboul )—soon steps forward to take credit and promises further attacks to "avenge the American wars on the Muslim world."
Meanwhile, our man in Samarra , CIA  operative Roger Ferris  (Leonardo DiCaprio ), sniffs for clues along Al-Saleem's bread-crumb trail. The terrorist and his followers have gone off the grid, we're told, conducting their meetings and transactions face to face rather than on the information superhighway—the better to avoid detection by the very technology that is the backbone of the American war machine. So Ferris devises a plan to lure Al-Saleem out of hiding that would seem preposterous were it not backed by the very military-industrial complex that has proved to rival Hollywood in matters of smoke-and-mirrors trickery. (Paging Jessica Lynch .) He invents a fictitious rival terror cell, equips it with fake bank accounts, plants allusive messages in all the right fundamentalist chat rooms, and dupes an innocent patsy—a Dubai  architect (Ali Suliman ) who meets all the requirements of "terror suspect" without actually being one—into an unwitting starring role in an act of mass destruction on American soil, produced and directed by the U.S. government.
Body of Lies  might best be described as a cat-and-mouse pursuit in which the felines and rodents spend more time chasing their own tails than stalking each other. (Think of the characters as the contemporary equivalents of the eternally feuding Napoleonic soldiers from Scott's 1977 debut feature, The Duellists .) For every one step forward Ferris takes on the ground in Iraq —and Syria , and Jordan—he ends up taking at least two steps back at the behest of his Langley superior, Ed Hoffman  (Russell Crowe ), who thinks nothing of compromising Ferris's sources if he deems it in the interest of "national security." It becomes something of a running joke in the film that while the wiry, Arabic-speaking Ferris is getting his ankles nipped at by rabid dogs in an Amman  alleyway and his skin embedded with shrapnel in a close-quarters explosion, the paunchy, Arkansas-accented Hoffman keeps tabs on everything from a comfortable remove, managing the operation from his cell phone while packing his kids off to school and engaging in other bits of emasculating domesticity. Not for a minute, though, do we doubt which of these two is the more dangerous man.
Body of Lies  comes carrying all sorts of familiar spy-movie baggage, from its cyclorama of exotic Middle East locations to the inevitable climax (by far the film's most conventional stretch) in which things suddenly turn personal for our ostensible hero and his grafted-on romantic interest (a comely Jordanian-Iranian nurse played by Golshifteh Farahani ). But its generic attributes (and title) notwithstanding, Scott's film may be the sharpest of all the post-9/11 thrillers—and also the most purely entertaining—in the way it maps the vectors and currents of the modern intelligence-gathering game without losing us in its dense narrative thicket. Even more refreshingly, Scott and Monahan don't feel obliged to keep up a p.c. balance of Arabs good and bad, Americans ideologically pure and bankrupt. And in Body of Lies ' macrocosmic view, even a villain like Al-Saleem seems an ultimately minor player at the mercy of distant power brokers with very powerful remote controls.
A long way from king of the world, DiCaprio here hides his adolescent face behind a scraggly, dark-brown beard and tries his best to sound grizzled, though his voice still quakes with the uncertainty of a high-school kid asking for a hall pass. Yet somehow that's all of a piece with the character, who seems to be one of those well-bred American youths who got into public service thinking he could actually make a difference, only to learn the hard way that war is a business and business is good. It is, along with Blood Diamond,  the most confident performance DiCaprio has given in one of his ostensibly grown-up roles.
But as good as DiCaprio is, Body of Lies  is stolen early and often right out from under him by a British actor named Mark Strong , cast here as the debonair chief of the Jordanian General Intelligence Department . Tailored to the nines in Savile Row  couture, calling everyone "my dear" in his mellifluous, dulcet tones, Strong's Hani Pasha  supplies information when convenient, withholds when necessary, baits presumed allies into a trap when he smells a rat, and oversees the torture of the occasional prisoner, all without unsettling a hair on his elegantly coiffed head. "Never lie to me," he advises Ferris upon their first meeting, though it's quite clear that Hani doesn't risk trusting anyone. Which, in the world of Body of Lies , is the only sure way of keeping your head above water.
