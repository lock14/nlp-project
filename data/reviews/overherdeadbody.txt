There�s just no end to America�s love affair with blandness, is there? Every time some new middle-of-the-road romantic comedy arrives onscreen to dredge the bottom of the cinematic barrel, I hope and pray that audiences will rise up, throw away their $8 buckets of popcorn, and stomp out of theatres in a huff (or a minute and a huff, as Groucho Marx would say) to demand something new and fresh. But it never seems to happen. Somehow Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Aniston still have careers, and somehow our expectations of the genre just keep dropping and dropping, from the heights of George Cukor and Woody Allen down to Nora Ephron and Rob Reiner, and then down further to the perfect mediocrity of Lowell and Parker, the brains and the beauty behind Over Her Dead Body
. San Antonio Spurs superfan Parker plays Kate, a bitchy monster of a bride-to-be who gets her comeuppance when an ice sculpture falls on her head on her wedding day. But not even death can stop a force as vindictive as Kate. Instead, she returns to earth in spirit form to keep an eye on her fianc�-in-mourning, Henry (Rudd, cashing in), and to wreak supernatural havoc on an attractive psychic (Bell) who�s using her gifts to wrangle Henry into bed. It�s not a bad premise for a movie � rich with the delicious possibilities of transmortal combat between an embittered, but deceased, woman and her usurping rival, who has the distinct advantage of being alive � and in the right hands it could have been something. Imagine what Rosalind Russell and Norma Shearer could have done with such roles, or Katharine Hepburn and Lauren Bacall, or even Salma Hayek and Regina King. Just think of the dialogue Billy Wilder or the Coen brothers could have written. Instead we get Parker and Bell, who approach their performances with all the comic agility and screen presence of supermodels on their first acting gig, and Lowell, who cut his teeth writing for god-awful sitcoms like The Drew Carey Show
 and Just Shoot Me
 and who apparently never met a daytime-TV-talk-show verbal slap-down he didn�t find hilarious. Where Over Her Dead Body
 should soar with blistering verbal gymnastics, it limps with empty sass about weight gain and skin blemishes; where it should race with inventive comic set-pieces, it slogs with extended flatulence sequences and gags about lifting overweight dogs. Where it should stop, it begins; where it should vanish, it will just keep on appearing, in theatres, on entertainment-news shows, in video stores, on and on, world without end.


"Over Her Dead Body" is to romantic comedy what Spam is to meat. But at least with Spam, you get cool packaging. With this movie, you get a migraine that begins the minute an ice sculpture crushes to death Kate (Eva Longoria Parker, taking Tony Parker's surname) on her wedding day. What should be the end of this movie is merely the beginning. Kate is one of those bridezillas who needs to control everything. So, as a ghost, she tries to commandeer the love life of her former groom, Henry (Paul Rudd). He's started dating Ashley (Lake Bell), the dingbat caterer-psychic who, incidentally, can see, hear, and be terrorized by Kate.
Bell's face is in the Amanda Peet-Jessica Simpson neighborhood. For a few years she's toiled on sub-par television shows, and most of this movie is a presumed showcase for her heretofore under-exploited slapstick skills - or what, in this comedy, would pass for slapstick.
When it comes to running soapy and almost nude through a gym or being slathered in mustard, Bell is a hard worker. But writer and first-time director Jeff Lowell doesn't think much of her character (he doesn't appear to think much of comedy, directing, or romance, either). For some reason, Henry gives Ashley a copy of David Foster Wallace's "Brief Interviews with Hideous Men," to which she says, "I can't wait not to read it." Ultimately, the film feels very much like an audition for a sitcom.
Longoria Parker is barely around - and when she is, you wish she'd go away. This isn't the case with her on "Desperate Housewives," where she frequently suggests she might be a comedienne. Here she's rushed and strident and pinched. You understand why she's here (she's probably looking for a "27 Dresses" of her own). But what's Rudd's excuse? He tries to inject some of his natural sarcasm into his scenes, but the movie is never as charming, witty, or smart as Rudd has been in other people's movies. Here the editing leaves him looking befuddled or painfully bored. That makes two of us.


 For what it is — a romantic comedy about the rivalry between a jealous ghost and a flaky psychic for the love of a veterinarian — “Over Her Dead Body” is not bad. Eva Longoria Parker, as Kate, the ghost, represents the control-freak/ice-queen end of the female comedic spectrum pretty well, while Lake Bell as Ashley, the psychic, is perfectly lovely on the sweet, scatterbrained end. In the middle is Henry the vet, played by the winningly smirky Paul Rudd, and there are sidekicks drawn from the usual storeroom: the kooky sister (Lindsay Sloane) and the gay male best friend (Jason Biggs).  There is no question that this movie, the first feature directed by Jeff Lowell, whose screenwriting credits include “John Tucker Must Die,” could be much worse. But it also could have been, with a little more effort, a lot better. The cast members are talented and game, but they struggle with some borderline-incompetent direction and a series of humorous situations that are less than fresh. I mean, sure, it’s always hilarious when a beautiful woman is squirted in the chest with mustard, or when Mr. Biggs’s arm catches on fire. But an extended bout of flatulence and a dessert-flambéing mishap don’t really yield big laughs. For good measure, there’s also an elderly priest and an overweight dog.  Near the end the guy rushes to the airport to catch the girl. This stunning plot development seems to have been designed either to elicit sympathy for the striking writers by giving a foretaste of the inferno of cliché into which their continued absence will plunge us all, or else to undermine that sympathy with a brazen display of hackdom. But maybe I should give Mr. Lowell a few points for originality, since this is to my knowledge the first rush-to-the-airport climax to feature a talking parrot riding in a taxi.  And I liked Ms. Longoria Parker, in a curve-hugging white dress, as the desperate housewife from hell. Or whatever zone of the afterlife Kate arrives at after an errant ice sculpture fatally disrupts her wedding to Henry. Possessive and controlling even in death, she tries to keep Ashley away from her erstwhile man through a campaign of annoyingness rather like the one Reese Witherspoon used against Mark Ruffalo in the jealous-ghost romantic comedy “Just Like Heaven.”  Ashley fights back rather half-heartedly, and the whole movie feels lazy and underdeveloped, in spite of the best efforts of the actors. Mr. Biggs, victim of a preposterous and unfunny plot twist, lends his knack for ungainly physical comedy, but Mr. Rudd is stranded in his own sarcasm. Ms. Bell works hardest of all and proves to be thoroughly charming in what amounts (I hope) to an audition for a better movie sometime in the near future.  “Over Her Dead Body” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some sexual references and situations.

Deceased fiancee Eva Longoria Parker returns to haunt Paul Rudd's subsequent romantic prospects in "Over Her Dead Body." But what's really spooky is that even the weakest "Desperate Housewives" episode packs more heat than this tepid romantic comedy-fantasy, whose basic plot gimmick has been done as far back as "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir." Vet sitcom writer Jeff Lowell's feature directorial debut is short on charm and laughs, and will expire quickly before an OK afterlife on DVD, cable and airplanes.
Just before her lavish outdoor wedding to Long Beach veterinarian Henry (Rudd), Kate (Longoria Parker) is exhibiting a Type A-plus personality, driving the caterers and everyone else mad with her micromanagement. Mortified that the ice-sculpture angel she'd ordered arrives sans wings, she orders the boozy artist (Stephen Root) to haul it away. 

But it accidentally falls on her, abruptly terminating more than just the nuptials. Waking in an all-white limbo, Kate proves so indignant and argumentative with a real (and wingless) angel that she's sent off -- neither to heaven nor hell, just off -- without the "orientation instructions" the angel gave up trying to give her.
A year later, Henry's sister Chloe (Lindsay Sloane) wants to get him out of his funk and back onto the dating scene. She figures he needs closure and badgers him into an appointment with her acquaintance Ashley (Lake Bell), a part-time psychic.
Chloe steals Kate's old diary and begs reluctant Ashley to fool Henry into thinking Kate wants him get on with his life. This works, but it also brings restless ghost-Kate onto the scene. Furious at her rival's duplicity, she finds she can be seen/heard only by Ashley (as well as animals), using that to terrify the young woman out of a tentative, mutually sparked relationship with Henry. Hilarity does not ensue en route to Kate's inevitable realization of what she has to do (and really wants, anyway) to get into heaven.
Slapstick, character writing and situations are generic at best. There's one bright idea -- involving a parrot -- but it's canceled out by the elaboration of a bad one that tries to put a cute (but condescending) twist on Jason Biggs' role as Ashley's (yawn) funny gay best friend.
Rudd, who was delightful last year in everything from "Knocked Up" to "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," proves that not even he can wring wit from this script's stone. He's still better than the material, as is "Boston Legal's" Bell, despite little chemistry between them.
Sloane's Chloe suffers from being one flaky-girl-type too many. Longoria Parker's part is a one-note bitch that she does nothing to make funny or distinctive beyond looking good.
This latter quality the pic itself achieves, though the widescreen lensing is so sunny-SoCal, you'd think Los Angelenos virtually swim in cream and orange. Other design aspects are glossily pro on a budget. David Kitay's score and soundtracked pop music cues are Contempo Romantic Comedy 101.
