Actor-turned-director Bill Paxton does an abrupt about-face from his violent directing debut, Frailty
, to this period piece about the improbable but true triumph of a 19-year-old amateur American golfer at the 1913 U.S. Open. The title refers to what some consider to be the most phenomenal round of golf ever played, when the untested American Francis Ouimet (LaBeouf) faced off against two British titans, Harry Vardon (Dillane) and Ted Ray (Marcus) � one David vs. two Goliaths, as one reporter puts it. Indeed, even for golf neophytes, the match re-creation is as riveting as the sports pages billed it, but there�s a lot of pokey exposition to wade through first. Scripter Mark Frost (the Twin Peaks
 producer who also wrote the book upon which this golf film is based) devotes much time to the class issues at hand. At the time, golf was considered a game for gentlemen only; neither Vardon nor Ouimet, a former caddy, were to the manor born, and the discrimination they endured shaped the men � and the athletes � they became. But the dramatization of these issues � especially in Ouimet�s relationship with his disapproving father (played by Koteas) � repeatedly strikes the same chord, with diminishing returns. (And as class is such a primary concern, it�s curious then that Frost never explains how Ouimet, the son of an immigrant day laborer, knows how to waltz and lives with his family in seeming middle-class comfort.) Paxton shows perhaps too much restraint in the film�s overlong first half, but the pace considerably quickens once the Open kicks off. LaBeouf, tamping down his loosey-goosey charm to play dramatic leading man, gains a sparring partner in the form of a stout, ballsy fifth-grader-turned-caddy named Eddie Lowery (Flitter). Eddie�s somewhat of a stock Disney character, but after so much somberness, his comic scowlings provide exactly the kind of kick in the pants The Greatest Game
 so needs. Paxton and DP Shane Hurlbut also inject into the game some inspired visual touches, including a quartet of top-hatted gentlemen who embody Vardon�s class-related inner demons and appear, phantomlike, at clutch moments. The Greatest Game
 never thrills on an emotional level the way the best of sports films � a Hoosiers
, say � can, but it�s a satisfying entertainment nonetheless.


Talk about setting the bar high: The new golf movie about Francis Ouimet's upset at the 1913 US Open at The Country Club in Brookline is called ''The Greatest Game Ever Played." Really? Ever
? Greater than the US hockey team's ''miracle" win at the 1980 Olympics? Greater than Johnny Unitas leading the Baltimore Colts past the New York Giants in 1958? Even on a local level: Greater than Games 4 through 7 (take your pick) of last year's Red Sox-Yankees playoffs?
This takes nerve, which the movie has in both spades and clubs. Based on screenwriter-producer Mark Frost's 2002 book and built on the sturdy bones of underdog classics from ''Rocky" to ''Seabiscuit," ''Greatest Game" begins in climactic mode and gears up from there. It's a True Story crowd-pleaser that embraces every sports cliche known to man, and it's easily the most hyperactive golf movie to date. I've felt less battered coming out of a boxing film.
You still may cry uncle quite happily, even if you're not one of the many people who find peculiar solace in hitting a small white ball with a stick. For one thing, the story's hard to resist. A former caddie who grew up literally across the street from The Country Club (at 246 Clyde St.; the house still stands), the 20-year-old Ouimet was a stringy blue-collar intruder on a gentleman's pastime: an unknown amateur who entered the 1913 Open against a field of giants.
His 36-foot putt on a soggy 17th hole during the second day of play is enshrined on any list of Top 10 Golf Moments; the following day's playoff between Ouimet and two Brits, Ted Ray and the legendary Harry Vardon, is hailed as the American democratization of the sport. President Taft attended the tournament, and so did about 15,000 Bostonians. The Bostonians came to see Ouimet.
He's played by Shia LeBeouf (''Holes") as a thoughtful, canny young man with a natural talent and the work ethic to take it somewhere. LeBeouf usually gives his roles a snarky edge, but he dispenses with that here; he knows Ouimet's game is his edge. Arrayed against this gifted prole are the moneyed snobs of Boston and The Country Club, and actor-turned-director Bill Paxton lets no opportunity slip to remind us that the toffs look on Ouimet with undisguised horror. ''This isn't the sort of thing caddies do
," says one TCC member, as if the kid had streaked the fifth green. Current members may rest assured the Club doesn't come in for serious smacking around; in any case, tournament sequences were shot at Montreal's Kanawaki Golf Club.
The most original touch in ''Greatest Game" is its insistence that Vardon (a smooth Stephen Dillane) and the massive powerhouse Ray (Stephen Marcus) were outsiders, too -- both raised in poverty on the Isle of Jersey and barred from the inner sanctums of Britain's gentleman's clubs. This denies the movie a convenient on-course villain, but it nicely strengthens the sense of solidarity among the leads. All three understand that they're here for love of the game and nothing more.
Elsewhere, no lily goes ungilded, from the training montage with the grizzled vet (Luke Askew) to the hero's disapproving immigrant father (Elias Koteas) to the dewy Chestnut Hill beauty (Peyton List) who captures Ouimet's heart -- her part's an invention, and an unnecessary one. The role of Eddie Lowery (Josh Flitter), on the other hand, is right out of the history books. Ouimet's levelheaded 10-year-old caddie was nearly as celebrated as the golfer, and the bond between the two probably contributed to the outcome. You can't improve on that, but Paxton tries anyway, turning the character into an adorable links-side Yoda, and while Flitter gets his laughs, someone should probably have taken a mulligan here.
The director seems more intent on fashioning a PGA Tilt-A-Whirl ride: He pumps the music up, fiddles with the photography so the frames look lovingly hand-tinted, fiddles some more with the facts (that final playoff score wasn't as close as the movie says), and sends the camera soaring with the ball, above the ball, sometimes through
 the ball. We fly through the trees, we look up through the green, we careen into the scoreboard, and at one point, Ted Ray tees up and the camera settles on a CGI ladybug landing delicately on the ball. Why? Because the technology's there to do it.
What's missing here is the one thing any duffer knows you need: Focus. ''The Greatest Game Ever Played" works so hard to convince you of the truth of its title that it never settles down to address the ball.

         The latest and least effective of Disney's inspirational sports movies, "The Greatest Game Ever Played" tells the strikingly similar tales of British golfing great Harry Vardon (Stephen Dillane) and upstart 20-year-old American amateur Francis Ouimet (Shia LaBeouf) and their meeting at the 1913 U.S. Open in Brookline, Mass. "Remember the Titans," "The Rookie" and "Miracle" all projected a level of respect for the sports they portrayed (football, baseball and hockey, respectively), but "Greatest Game" double bogeys, making last year's rather staid golf drama "Bobby Jones — Stroke of Genius" seem like a winner by comparison.
 
  Director Bill Paxton, working from Mark Frost's adaptation of his own book, spins an old-fashioned tale as Vardon and Ouimet battle aristocratic twits in their struggle to break down the barriers of class to play the game they love.
 


         






    Dillane and LaBeouf are fine, but they're surrounded by such underwritten stereotypes as Ouimet's disapproving father (Elias Koteas) and the pretty little rich girl (Peyton List) who gives him the time of day despite her family's objections. Paxton and Frost lay the schmaltz on thickly, but the deal-breaker is the overuse of special effects, which make the game in question look more like pinball than golf.
 
  Josh Flitter, as Ouimet's cherubic, 10-year-old caddy, steals his scenes, spouting such lyrical, can-do axioms as "Read it. Roll it. Hole it" and "Easy peasy, lemon squeezy."
 
 "The Greatest Game Ever Played,"
 PG for some brief mild language. Running time: 2 hours. In general release.   

What have the makers of The Greatest Game Ever Played  done with Shia LaBeouf, that loose, off-kilter kid from Holes  and Constantine ? As Francis Ouimet, the true-life 20-year-old ''peasant'' caddy who swatted against the blue bloods at the 1913 U.S. Open, LaBeouf trods too solemnly through this puttering Disney sand trap, frowning down at an awful lot of golf balls but rarely cracking a smile for us folks in the gallery. At the same time, the movie is so hungry for love that the orchestra shrieks, caps fly into the air, and the slo-mo oozes in when the lad merely forces a final play-off...and there's still 20 minutes to go! (At the end-end, grown men cry into their giant mustaches, a soft piano reprises the orchestral thunder, and a peculiar last shot pays homage to that sports classic Casablanca.) Disney evokes Miracle  and The Rookie  in its marketing, but this is Nine-Iron Will, and the big postgame question is why director Bill Paxton decided to follow up his helming debut, the 2002 ax-murder drama Frailty , with an inert family golf movie.


Based on the true tale of the 1913 U.S. Open, in which a youth from the wrong side of the tracks surprised the pros, "The Greatest Game Ever Played," the second feature directed by actor-cum-director Bill Paxton, offers an inspiring story, lush visuals and accessible characters to give a black-hat-white-hat view of class struggle in America and England. Pic should attract auds in modest amounts across the board, including those not particularly enamored of golf, a sport previously served on screen far more successfully by comedy than drama. "Greatest Game" is no "Caddyshack," of course. But it isn't "Tin Cup" either.
In the 1913 U.S. Open, the unknown, 20-year-old Francis Ouimet came out of nowhere to discombobulate the world's best players. What Paxton has directed is actually two stories, one about Ouimet and one about Harry Vardon, the winner of a record six British opens and still considered England's best golfer (he died in 1937).
Young Harry (James Paxton), whose siblings sleep three to a bed, awakens one morning to find surveyors readying his family's Isle of Jersey home for the construction of a golf course.
What is golf? "Golf is a game played by gentlemen," says the most ghoulish of the group. "Not for the likes of you."
Insulted and evicted, Harry will grow up to become the best at a game whose presiding ethos was about what one had, rather than who one was.
Across the pond, and two decades later, young Francis (Matthew Knight) caddies at the golf club across from his family home in Brookline, Mass., and becomes enthralled by the larger-than-life persona of the seemingly unbeatable Vardon.
Against the objections of his class-conscious father (Elias Koteas), Francis' mother (Marnie McPhail) takes him to a demonstration being given by the visiting English champ. And so the two are enjoined in what will be an epic, if two-fronted, war against the assumptions and biases of class in both the U.S. and England.
The real star of the film is Stephen Dillane, whose Vardon remains proud in spite of attempts by others -- such as the debauched Lord Northcliffe (Peter Firth), who bankrolls the English invasion of the 1913 Open -- to humiliate him because of his lower-class background.
Although the movie doesn't mention it, the previous year had seen the sinking of the Titanic, the most polarizing event of the infant century in matters concerning haves and have-nots. As author Mark Frost's screenplay implies, Francis' father is bitter because in America, he has discovered the same elitist attitudes he thought he had left behind in Europe (although where in Europe is a mystery, as is Koteas' accent).
Harry, gripped by the same feelings of anger and inferiority, internalizes them, and Dillane does a marvelous job of communicating the taciturn Harry's turmoil -- wordlessly but with profound effect.
The same cannot be said of Shia LaBeouf, who plays Ouimet, caddy turned amateur wunderkind. LaBeouf's Francis has too much poise, even cockiness, to generate much sympathy as the kid from the wrong part of town.
LaBeouf, who comes across as a hybrid of Edward Norton and Donald O'Connor, is surrounded by people affecting what are supposed to be period speech patterns, inflections and vocabulary, and yet he seems to have stepped directly out of 2005. Both Paxton and scripter Frost must accept some of the blame for this -- did golfers pump their arms and exclaim "Yes!!" when they sank a putt in 1913? This clash of period and contemporary infects the movie as a whole.
Accents are also a bit off-putting. Although he's the child of an Irish immigrant mother and a father of unspecified origin, Francis speaks perfectly modern American, as does his Open caddy, pint-sized Eddie Lowery -- played by Josh Flitter, whose pugnacious performance will win him a following.
Visually, Paxton's picture is more pretty than it is authentic -- it is a fantasy of a sort, after all. Amid the overly heroic, Celtic-flavored strains of Brian Tyler's score is a Babel-esque melange of tones and eras.
It's curious that a filmmaker who could debut with something as flawed but personal as "Frailty" could so effortlessly sidle into the role of big-budget sports movie/period piece director, but Paxton makes the most of what technology has given him -- perhaps the slowest slo-mo putts in history are recorded here, as well as balls soaring directly into the camera and various magical realist hallucinations signifying Francis and Harry's mutual self-doubt.
But when dealing with the purely human elements, Paxton fails to connect -- his cutaways to Francis' careworn but perpetually startled mother every time something big happens at the golf course across the street become comical after a while.
The final moments, with the music swelling and the "Casablanca"-like ending, with Francis and Eddie walking off together across the turf, shows a heavy-handedness that should have been avoided.

Anyone who never considered golf a hotbed of class conflictthat is, pretty much everyonewill be enlightened by The Greatest Game Ever Played , Bill Paxton 's adaptation of Mark Frost 's 2002 nonfiction bestseller. The story details the 1913 U.S. Open  rivalry between Yank amateur Francis Ouimet  (Shia LaBeouf ) and British pro Harry Vardon  (Stephen Dillane ), both of whom had working-class roots and battled golf's upper-crust gatekeepers for the right to play. Paxton gives Frost's screenplay the full Disney  polish, with squeaky-clean period detail and even cleaner divisions between the good-hearted plebs and conniving swells. But he also elicits open, nuanced performances from his cast (including the great Luke Askew ) and achieves a charged stillness that nicely conveys the self-combative isolation of athletic endeavors. That said, the CGI-enhanced links sequences are a jarring distraction, and the movie's overly detailed approach couldn't be more exhausting: Ouimet versus Vardon probably was the greatest golf game ever played, and Paxton and Frost do it justice, but I wouldn't sit through another simulated hole of it for Tiger Woods 's salary.
