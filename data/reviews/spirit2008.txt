It must really hurt to kill the thing you love.
"The Spirit" was always for connoisseurs and cultists. Created by the late, great Will Eisner in 1940, it may have been the first auteur comic book, unbeholden to DC or Marvel and written with a literate wit that owed equal amounts to film noir and Eisner's Jewish New York roots. Imagine "Spider-Man" written by a tougher, more soulful Jules Feiffer (who, in fact, was Eisner's assistant early on) and you're halfway there.
Frank Miller, of course, is the very model of a modern comics auteur: the writer-illustrator who retooled "Batman" into "The Dark Knight" in the 1980s and created the dark, anarchic "Sin City" in the 1990s. He directed the film version of "Sin City" in 2005 - a blast of vicious pulp energy - and now has brought one of his acknowledged influences to the screen. If anyone could honor "The Spirit," it should be Miller.
Enough history; how's the movie? In a word: dispiriting. Taking the same visual approach to this material that he did to "Sin City" - tilted comic-panel angles, intentionally cartoonish action, images desaturated of color except for one key element (like yellow police tape or the hero's red necktie) - Miller turns "The Spirit" into a hambone farce. Worse, by hiring well-known actors and indulging their worst impulses, he destroys the tart irony Eisner built into every frame.
Gabriel Macht plays the barely masked hero - a former Central City cop mysteriously brought back from the dead to fight crime - and he at least understands that the Spirit's a Bogart figure with supernatural touches. The film's villain - in more ways than one - is Samuel L. Jackson as The Octopus, an egg-obsessed criminal mastermind bent on achieving immortality. Jackson's performance is one for the record books: He screams, he preens, he schpritzes, and when all else fails, he repeats his lines over and over. Over and over. Over and over.
At least he's trying. (Really trying.) As two of the many wasp-waisted femmes fatales who alternately swoon for the Spirit and try to kill him, Eva Mendes (as Sand Saref) and Scarlett Johansson (as Silken Floss; the names are Eisner's inventions) have no clue how to get on the comic book's mordant/serious/goofy wavelength. Accordingly, they simply shut down. Both actresses are lovely to look at and actively painful to hear.
A vase of Hercules'
 blood and long-lost Argonaut treasure figure into the plot, but just barely. Miller is aiming for pure style - another man's style at that - and it's just too idiosyncratic to translate across mediums. (There's a reason a "Spirit" movie was never made while Eisner was alive; a 1987 TV pilot never took off.) The movie's cleverest idea is to give the Octopus identical clone henchmen with names like Phobos, Logos, and Huevos, all played by Louis Lombardi with a marvelous fat-boy idiot grin. They don't mind committing hara-kiri on command. Well before "The Spirit" gives up the ghost, neither will you.


The city is an inky maze of tenements and skyscrapers and back alleys, and the dialogue is so hard-boiled you could just about break your tooth on it. The hero, with his fedora, trench coat, Lone Ranger mask, and bloodred necktie  one of the only slashes of color on display  is a former detective who has become a ghost, but there's nothing particularly supernatural about his attitude. Dead or alive (or somewhere in between), he's the dame-slapping tough guy of a thousand film noirs and film-noir knockoffs.
The Spirit , an adaptation of the legendary comic strip created by Will Eisner in 1940, was directed by Frank Miller , who showed Eisner's influence in the creation of his graphic novels Batman: The Dark Knight Returns  and Sin City . The movie is heavy  one might even say mythic  with the reverent weight of cross-generational pedigree. But if, like me, you stand outside the circle of comic-book obsessives, The Spirit  comes off as just another ludicrously knowing and mannered noir pastiche, full of burnt-end romance and ''style,'' but robotic at its core. It's like the 2005 movie version of Sin City   without all that arresting Day-Glo splatter. The Spirit (Gabriel Macht) must face down the Octopus, a baddie who wants to acquire a vase that holds the blood of Hercules (to make him immortal); he's played by Samuel L. Jackson  with a cackle that is never quite dangerous. As the vamps, Eva Mendes  and Scarlett Johansson  might be posing for a fashion spread with just one note to play  gorgeous high-bitch mockery. Miller stages it all with sleek angularity, but it's the film's clichés that seem to have lived forever.

 Out in the blogosphere you frequently run across invocations of Godwin’s Law, which can be paraphrased as stating that sooner or later every argument will come around to a Hitler analogy. A similar axiom, applied to Hollywood, would stipulate that every movie star must eventually dress up in a German war uniform.  This is not the review of “Valkyrie,” by the way, a film that upholds this rule with respect to the special case of Tom Cruise. I’m just trying to figure out why, somewhere in the middle of “The Spirit,” Samuel L. Jackson and Scarlett Johansson arrive on screen decked out in swastikas and jackboots. Nothing in the logic of the film explains it, but then, to use the phrase “the logic of the film” when talking about “The Spirit” may be to take the “oxy” out of “oxymoronic.”  To ask why anything happens in Frank Miller’s sludgy, hyper-stylized adaptation of a fabled comic book series by Will Eisner may be an exercise in futility. The only halfway interesting question is why the thing exists at all. The most plausible answer lies in its pedigree. Eisner, who died in 2005, is worshiped by aficionados of what he called “sequential art” for his graphic brio, literary flair and naughty wit. For his part Mr. Miller occupies a special spot in the modern geek pantheon as the author of high-gloss comics and graphic novels like “Batman: The Dark Knight Returns,” “Sin City” and “300.”  Though he was involved in the film adaptations of “300” and “Sin City,” “The Spirit” marks Mr. Miller’s first solo effort as a director, and his bold visual style is not well served by his clumsiness as a cinematic storyteller. The movie seems to be trying to combine a knowing, winking sense of pop-culture history with an embrace of the more soulful aspects of that history, but the result is a talky, pretentious stew of film noir poses and crime-fighter clichés.  Mr. Jackson and Ms. Johansson at least seem to enjoy themselves, which is their prerogative since they are the villains. Gabriel Macht, who plays the fedora-wearing, skirt-chasing, undead hero (a former policeman brought mysteriously back to life as a vigilante), works hard to give off an air of hard-boiled insouciance. Unfortunately whatever natural charisma he may possess is disguised by his  hat, his mask and the murky shadows of the mise-en-scène.  What is most striking about “The Spirit” is how little pleasure it affords, in spite of its efforts to be sly, sexy, heartfelt and clever all at once. Or perhaps the movie flounders because its multiple ambitions are fundamentally at odds, like the various femmes, fatale and otherwise, who do battle for the hero’s heart.  The 108 overstuffed, interminable minutes of “The Spirit” yield exactly two memorable moments: when one of Mr. Jackson’s genetically engineered minions (all played by Louis Lombardi) appears as a tiny, hopping foot with a head grafted on to it, supplying an odd, creepy morsel of Surrealism; and when Eva Mendes, playing a character called Sand Saref, sits on a copy machine and presses the button. She produces what may be the only true-to-life image in the movie, as well as the most interesting.  “The Spirit” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Its intense brutality is carefully edited and shaded to emphasize its fantastical nature.

A slain cop is resurrected as a masked crime-fighter in "The Spirit," but Frank Miller's solo writing-directing debut plunges into a watery grave early on and spends roughly the next 100 minutes gasping for air. Pushing well past the point of self-parody, Miller has done Will Eisner's pioneering comicstrip no favors by drenching it in the same self-consciously neo-noir monochrome put to much more compelling use in "Sin City." Graphic-novel geeks will be enticed by the promise of sleek babes and equally eye-popping f/x, but general audiences will probably pass on this visually arresting but wholly disposable Miller-lite exercise. 
If this summer's "The Dark Knight" raised the bar for seriousness, ambition and dramatic realism in the comicbook-based superhero genre, "The Spirit" reps its antithesis: Relentlessly cartoonish and campy, it's a work of pure digital artifice, feverishly committed to its own beautiful, hollow universe to the exclusion of any real narrative interest or engagement with its characters.
As such, it's not clear exactly who the pic's intended audience is. Devotees of Eisner's original creation, who first popped up in Sunday newspapers around 1940, won't warm to this ultra-stylized update, and fans of "Sin City" (which Miller adapted from his own comicbook series and co-helmed with Robert Rodriguez) will find it pretty weak sauce -- a soft-boiled PG-13 trifle to whet their appetites for "Sin City 2" in 2010.
Initially, Miller's screenplay seems to break with formula by dispensing with the origin story of its eponymous hero. As the pic opens, ex-cop Denny Colt (Gabriel Macht) has already been transformed via mysterious means into a vigilante with almost as many lives as the stray cats strewn throughout the pic. With his dark fedora, cape and eyemask, boldly accentuated by a blood-red necktie, the Spirit cuts an imposing figure on this black-and-white canvas; predictably, he's something of a ladies' man, but, as he discloses in voiceover, his one true love is the city whose mean streets offer him no shortage of opportunities to mete out justice.
Pic rapidly introduces the Spirit's flamboyant archnemesis, the Octopus (Samuel L. Jackson), who seems just as immune to bodily injury as the Spirit is; voluptuous gold-digger Sand Saref (Eva Mendes), with whom the Spirit shares a troubled, sepia-toned history; pugnacious police commissioner Dolan (Dan Lauria) and his daughter, Ellen (Sarah Paulson), a doctor who has long carried a torch for the masked crusader.
The question of how Colt acquired his powers is meant to propel the story forward, but an air of inconsequence sets in almost immediately with the first mano-a-mano clash between the Spirit and the Octopus, neither of whom seems capable of destroying the other. Barely 15 minutes in, the sense of anticlimactic overkill is palpable.
There's a lot going on here, but none of it sticks -- not the shopworn plotting nor the arch, stilted dialogue. The actors often seem to be delivering their lines in ironic quote marks, suggesting a straight-faced sendup of noir and comicbook conventions that, whatever the intended effect, falls mostly flat.
The Spirit himself doesn't supply much of a rooting interest; Macht's role is colorless in more ways than one, and we see more of the actor's nicely sculpted torso than his face (most bigscreen heroes have the decency to take off their masks once in a while). Mendes and Lauria come off better, injecting their perfs with sizzle and bite, respectively.
Jaime King, so seductive in "Sin City," is required to act mostly in silhouette as a lethal lady-in-the-lake type (adding a dash of Arthurian legend to the pic's stew of Greek-mythology references), while Scarlett Johansson looks bored as the Octopus' icy sidekick, Silken Floss. This leaves the bellowing, trigger-happy Jackson to pick up the slack and chew the scenery -- or in this case, the green-screen -- gleefully donning wigs, face-paint and, at one point, Nazi garb to drive home the fact that, yup, he's one weird, bad dude.
Visually and viscerally, "The Spirit" is less extreme and intense than "Sin City," and d.p. Bill Pope periodically allows some warmth and color to bleed into his stark palette. There's no denying the fastidiousness and occasional virtuosity of the overall design, or the lustrous texture of the widescreen images. But all this incessant monochrome has its perils, too: When a man falls to the ground, his body covered with white bloodstains, it's unclear whether he's been felled by bullets or by incontinent birds.


With the fanboys anxiously eying Zack Snyder 's Watchmen  adaptation, Frank Miller 's version of The Spirit  sneaks into theaters almost unnoticed on Christmas Day—good thing, too. Miller, comics-writing icon turned director, has rendered comics-industry revolutionary Will Eisner 's crime fighter Denny Colt  a grim shade of dull—all talk, no action, save for a few slapstick mash-ups of old Warner Bros. cartoons and Miller's own Sin City , which has the effect of turning Eisner's Technicolor comic into a gray glob of hardboiled mush. Colt (Gabriel Macht , ehh), dead and deadpan, is a killed cop resurrected courtesy of the Octopus (Samuel L. Jackson  turned up to 11), a baddie who now wants the good guy dead, I tell ya, dead . Complicating matters are the femme fatales stopping by between Maxim  shoots: Eva Mendes  as the lost love, Jaime King  as the angel of death, and Scarlett Johansson  as the Octopus's extra tentacle. Miller gets away with his revisionist redo because, at this late date, The Spirit 's been spirited away to the history books. Besides, the movie's so full of nods to comics and their creators (from DC Comics  founder Harry Donenfeld  to artist Steve Ditko ) that the fanboys will find room in their heart to forgive the desecration. Everyone else won't care at all.
