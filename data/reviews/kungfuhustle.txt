         In a 1940s Chinese police station, a camera darts and swerves like a trapped, startled bird as a brutal street gang beats a hapless cop senseless, sending him crashing into a sign that reads "Crimebusters." Having sufficiently terrorized the police corps, the gang saunters into the street, whereupon its leader takes one look at the deserted movie theater across the way and sneers, "Sunday afternoon and the place is deserted. Who would go into the movie business?"
 
  The gang doesn't have long to ponder the paradox, because within moments, the vicious, top-hat-wearing Axe Gang is upon them and things get ugly fast — albeit in a beautifully shot and stunningly choreographed way. It's a scene straight out of a dozen movies. Written and directed by Stephen Chow ("Shaolin Soccer"), one of China's best-loved actors, who also stars, "Kung Fu Hustle" is set in a nostalgically rendered Hong Kong neighborhood similar to the one in which Chow grew up. But the director takes his aesthetic cues from sources as wide-ranging as Hong Kong action films of the '70s and '80s, wink-nudge Hollywood action movies and — thanks to the magic of CGI — the Warner Bros.' Looney Toons oeuvre
. A lively, action-packed and witty piece of globalist entertainment, "Kung Fu Hustle" winks right back, as when a badly injured character uses his last breath to recite a line from "Star Wars," startling his friend into exclaiming, "Donut! Why aren't you speaking Chinese?"
 


         






    As brutal as it is ridiculous (its members follow hatchet massacres with Michael Jackson-inspired dance numbers), the Axe Gang wanders into the poor neighborhood of Pig Sty Alley on the heels of the bumbling Sing (Chow), a wannabe gangster who has stirred up more trouble than he can handle. The neighborhood's humble inhabitants aren't accustomed to violence — they usually go about their daily business enduring nothing more painful than a playful slap or goose courtesy of the pesky Landlord (Yuen Wah) and trying to steer clear of his ferociously surly wife. But the apartment block turns out to be home to five people who are more than they seem: Donut (Dong Zhi Hua), Tailor (Chiu Chi Ling), Coolie (Xing Yu), Landlord and, of course, Landlady (Yuen Qui), a violent dervish in rollers and a housecoat and with a cigarette permanently grafted to her sneering lip, who thinks nothing of knocking Landlord out the window upon noticing a smudge of lipstick on his cheek.
 
  The leader of the Axe Gang is hurt in the fight, precipitating a grudge match. So the gang recruits Sing to track down the Beast (Leung Siu Lung), now committed to a lunatic asylum, and the only man alive capable of exacting revenge.
 
  For all its extreme cartoonish violence, "Kung Fu Hustle" is a surprisingly sweet and charming movie that mocks the shallow posturing of unabashed cinematic love songs to bad guys. A mediocre villain — his total dedication to badness notwithstanding (all explained in haunting flashback) — Sing turns out to be destined for something else entirely. A hapless buffoon stuck in adolescence until he unblocks his chi and changes his ways, Sing transforms into a one-with-everything warrior. (His unbeatable finale involves shooting into the heavens and planting one on the Buddha's kisser.) Brilliantly choreographed and shot, "Kung Fu Hustle" is often grisly, visually spectacular and unabashedly silly, sometimes all at once, but at its core it's the story of young Sing's sentimental education and the coming of age of his (surrogate) parents. Kung Fu Master knows best.

It's been a long time  you might have to go back to the Bruce Lee era  since a martial-arts film busted through the limits of physical freedom as wildly, and promiscuously, as Kung Fu Hustle , Stephen Chow's insanely entertaining smash-fantasy burlesque. Chow, perhaps the first action star and filmmaker to be as influenced by classic cartoons as by the karate-chop balletics of human movement, directs like a gonzo fusion of Tarantino and Tex Avery. You know where every punch and kick is coming from, but it's far less clear what will happen after they land. Bodies go flying into space, and faces get pummeled until they end up somewhere beneath the ground. At one point, two men conduct a battle by strumming notes on a stringed instrument: Each note sends forth a quasi-visible gust of air, which crests into a wave of force so sharp that it reveals itself on screen as a shower of knives. The scene creates its own nutty physics, and all of Kung Fu Hustle  is like that: You don't just watch it, you ride with it, laughing all the way.
In the world according to Chow, fighting prowess is a form of magical slapstick Zen that can come from anybody and anywhere. Take the Land-lady (Yuen Qiu), a whiny harridan in curlers who dominates the working-class ghetto of Pig Sty Alley. She's the last character on earth you'd expect to be a martial-arts master, yet Chow works with such a screwy democratic spirit that she turns out to be just that. The chief villains, or so it appears in the leaky madhouse of what I'll kindly call a plot, are the Axe Gang, a tribe of top-hatted brutes  inspired by Bill the Butcher's crew in Gangs of New York   who wreak bloody havoc on Pig Sty Alley. It's fair to think that these whirligig cutthroats have set the standard for homicidal omnipotence, but they're pussycats next to the Beast (Leung Siu Lung), who emerges in his tacky hospital sandals, like a Dr. Lecter gone to seed, to prove that he can kill all comers. It's up to Chow, as the poseur-turned-hero, to match him blow for mighty surreal blow. He does it in a climax of high-flying ultraviolence that will leave you gasping between giggles.

he recent popularity of Chinese-language action movies has been a curiously highbrow phenomenon, as filmmakers of lofty reputation, like Ang Lee and Zhang Yimou, have discovered the pleasures (and the profits) of swordplay and wire work. Their forays into action romance - "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"  "Hero" and "House of Flying Daggers" - are full of swooping choreography and thrilling combat, but they are also marked by a stately, almost reverent tone. Luckily, Stephen Chow, the writer, director and star of "Kung Fu Hustle" (and the earlier "Shaolin Soccer"), is around to knock the genre off its high horse, and to remind American audiences, as Jackie Chan did before him, that clowning is as much a part of this cinematic tradition as nobility and sacrifice. Though it features a number of stars from the Hong Kong martial arts firmament - including Yuen Wah, Leung Siu Lung and Yuen Qiu, who was also in the James Bond movie "The Man With the Golden Gun" - "Kung Fu Hustle" has a demented appeal not limited to specialists or aficionados. Hectic and eclectic, the movie snatches tasty morsels of international pop culture, ranging from Looney Tunes to Sergio Leone to "Airplane!," and tosses them into a fast-moving blender. After 90 minutes, you will be dizzy and perhaps a little annoyed, but those aftereffects, like the queasiness that follows an amusement park ride on a stomach full of junk food, serve as proof that you have been thoroughly and mercilessly entertained. A thrill ride like this hardly requires a plot summary, and in any case the story is deliberately cobbled together out of time-worn conventions, which it both obeys and mocks. In a vaguely defined "time of social unrest," with sets and costumes meant to evoke China in the brief interval between World War II and the Communist revolution, a pair of hapless lowlifes (Mr. Chow and Lam Tze Chung), pretending to be members of the dreaded Axe  Gang, arrive in a dusty slum known as Pig Sty. Their failed attempt to terrorize the residents, who are much tougher than they appear, attracts the attention of the real Axe Gang, setting up a climactic series of battles among legendary kung fu warriors. These include Pig Sty's stumbling-drunk Landlord (Yuen Wah) and his wife (Yuen Qiu), a foulmouthed harridan in a housedress and curlers, whose chain-smoking does not seem to have weakened her lungs much. The showstopping fight sequences are choreographed by the legendary Yuen Wo Ping (whose credits include "Crouching Tiger," the "Matrix" movies and "Kill Bill") and given an extra jolt of nutty inventiveness by some cheerfully crude digital effects. Mr. Chow and his special-effects team use computer-generated imagery the way  Chuck Jones and Tex Avery used pen and ink - as a form of anarchic protest against the laws of physics and the limitations of physiology. Eyes pop, feet spin and fists leave dents and divots on their targets. All that's missing is an Acme delivery truck and a ready supply of anvils. Although its blend of mayhem and spoofery seems ideally suited to 12-year-old boys, "Kung Fu Hustle," unlike the version of "Shaolin Soccer" released in the United States, is sufficiently bloody and profane to warrant an R rating. Mr. Chow, true to his roots, sometimes carries slapstick to the point of gruesome brutality, which shows a certain integrity: this stuff may be fun, but you can really get hurt doing it. He also, again in accordance with tradition, slides from the hard-boiled to the softly sentimental, with flashbacks to his character's childhood that set up a swoony romance with a mute, delicately featured ice cream vendor (Huang Sheng Yi). Her silence gives the picture its few moments of peace, while the Landlady's mugging and ranting supply a raucous comic vigor that makes the fight choreography and the special effects almost redundant. Yuen Qiu, a Hong Kong star of the 70's, has not appeared in a movie in nearly 30 years, and "Kung Fu Hustle" suggests that, in that time, world cinema has been deprived of a great comedienne. She is said to have gained 30 pounds to give the Landlady some necessary heft, but she seems to burn it all off on screen, as she tears through a performance that is equal parts Lucille Ball, Thelma Ritter and the Tasmanian Devil. The film itself displays a similarly manic energy, spinning around like a high-tech windup toy designed to wear out its users and keep going. There will probably be sequels, but to some extent they will be redundant, since "Kung Fu Hustle" can be watched again and again. This is only partly a compliment: for all its punches, kicks, whacks and thumps, the movie does not have much impact, and for all its affectionate nostalgia, it produces a strange kind of amnesia. It knocks the sense right out of your head, and its own as well. "Kung Fu Hustle" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity and stylized but intense violence.
Those who monitor popular cinema don't have a super-abundance of positive developments to report these days. The once great highway of mass entertainment has been a pretty lonely roadwhich may be why the puff of Steamboy  or the arrival of Stephen Chow 's Kung Fu Hustle  looms so large against the horizon. The 42-year-old Chow is the reigning king of Hong Kong comedy as well as the industry's most bankable star. As a writer-director, he's also something of an auteur. Kung Fu  Hustle  split last year's Hong Kong Film Awards with Wong Kar-wai 's 2046,  and as cheerfully cheese dog as the Chow opus appears, it's no less personal than 2046 and perhaps even more so.
A martial arts film that's gloriously nonsensical and kickass deflationary (the Chinese title is simply Kung Fu ), Kung Fu Hustle  is most obviously autobiographical in referencinglargely through its castingthe Bruce Lee -era movies of Chow's adolescence. The mode, however, is not nostalgic. Kung Fu Hustle  misses few opportunities to parody China's (and Sony Classics') current Crouching Flying Heroizing cinema of quality, not to mention The Matrix  and Gangs of New York . Indeed, Kung Fu Hustle 's major set suggests a Five Points knockoffChow has also said that this vast tenement, known as Pig Sty Alley, is like one in which he grew up. As in a kid's fantasy, the place becomes a cosmic battleground. The catalyst is Chow's role-playing. The typically underdog Chow charactera sneak thief with dreams of glorypretends to be a member of the dread Axe Gang in order to shake down a local barber. The ploy not only backfires but precipitates a full-scale invasion of Pig Sty Alley by a horde of hatchet-wieldin g, top-hat-wearing dandies.
No less than Jerry Lewis , Chow will do nearly anything for a laughas his booger jokes demonstrate. His comic persona was largely built on deadpan motormouth ranting, and Kung Fu H  u  stle  applies the same principle to action. No special effect is too primitive nor sight gag too old. The movie plays with accelerated action as much as any since the advent of sound. Chow also dotes on CGI mutations, subjecting body shapes, weather patterns, and space itself to a variety of eccentric shifts. Meanwhile, the characters vent their proscenium-bending complaints: "It's tiring being tough!" "How come every time you get hurt you recover so fast?"
For much of the movie, Chow is flung around, haplessly absorbing punishment from a number of unlikely sources. In one gag, he leads a bullying middle-aged l ady on a high-speed footrace through the countryside, tracking her progress by using the knives sticking out of his body as a rearview mirror. But then he realizes his destinynamely making this particular psychodramaand becomes a martial arts genius. (This fate was determined when, as a child, he bought the Scroll of the Golden Palmkind of a sacred comic bookfrom a derelict peddler.)
Once the denizens of Pig Sty Alley likewise turn out to be secret kung fu masters, the tenement's shabby courtyard becomes the arena for the application of sticks, spears, and menacing hex gestures. Teeth fly and screams shatter bricks. The indescribable assortment of space-warping, shape-shifting, gravity-juggling shenanigans are worthy of the Elder splash panels in early Mad  or the digital effects in Michael Snow 's *Corpus Callosum . In the last battle, Chow is dropkicked into the sky, where he terrifies the birds and sees the face of a cloud-formed Buddha before returning to earth as a deadly missile.
The fights were choreographed by master Yuen Wo Ping and, escalating from straightforward kick-punch-and-parry through aerial acrobatics to delirious CGI freestyle, they are as spectacular as they are laughable. Chow manages to have his cake and eat it too: Kung Fu Hustle  is a kung fu parody that's also a terrific kung fu movie.
