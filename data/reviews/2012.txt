Life is simple in Emmerich�s films. Confronted with unprecedented perils on a scale never before seen, the characters in his disaster epics manage to reaffirm their broken loves, make amends for slipshod parenting, and, most impressively, outrun fireballs and certain death with their hides and wits intact. This is true whether the peril comes from a sudden influx of illegal aliens (Independence Day
), a pregnant and irradiated escapee from Ishiro Honda's nightmares (Godzilla
), or nature run amok (The Day After Tomorrow
, which, handily, also appears to double as a flip-book condensation of Al Gore's nightmares). Cinematic catharsis of this sort is probably necessary and certainly entertaining and is based on a series of melodramatic tropes understood and undertaken by everyone from Cecil B. DeMille to Ray Harryhausen to Irwin Allen. The German-born Emmerich takes the disaster-movie genre to its logical conclusion in 2012
, obliterating or reconfiguring vast swaths of the planet's surface (solar storms boil the Earth's core; tectonic havoc ensues) and providing a 158-minute thrill ride that zips by like the real thing. Over the duration, there are homages (or lifts) to apocalyptic exercises of decades past (particularly producer George Pal's terrific 1951 When Worlds Collide
, which � ha! � is currently being remade by Stephen Sommers) and plenty of cheeky references to Emmerich's own r�sum�. Cusack plays beleaguered writer Jackson Curtis. Separated from his wife (Peet) and kids (James, Lily), he stumbles across Harrelson's conspiracy theorist/wild-eyed prophet Charlie Frost while on a dad-weekend visit to Yellowstone National Park. (At this point in his career, Harrelson deserves some sort of genre-spanning award for the 2009 triple threat of Zombieland
, The Messenger
, and 2012
.) Cut to the White House, where ultranoble President Wilson (Glover) and his squirrelly Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser (Platt) are already way ahead of the masses � they've known about the end of the world for a while now � and from there to myriad subplots and secondary characters as disaster looms and, well, you pretty much know the drill by now. 2012
 is PTSD � Popcorn Thrills and Sappy meloDrama � supersized to counter current collective real-world terrors, and it is, by turns, thrilling, ridiculous (the script, by Emmerich and longtime co-writer Harald Kloser, is riddled with howlingly goofy lines and seriously improbable deus-ex-machina moments), and just plain big, dumb fun. Where else are you going to get a chance to see the aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy
 drift down the side of a mile-high tsunami and take out the White House? Big. Dumb. Fun.

I like to imagine that the director Roland Emmerich had a key transformative experience at the age of 7, when a relative visiting from Bavaria  accidentally trampled his scale model of the Reichstag. Suddenly a light bulb went on over our young Teuton’s head as he realized: People will pay for this
.

In what exact sense he may have meant that remains ambiguous, but Emmerich now stands as our premier Hollywood Disastermeister, nuking and zapping historical landmarks in “Independence Day,’’ “The Day After Tomorrow,’’ “Godzilla,’’ and other works of taste and forbearance. He has long since surpassed the previous title-holder, producer Irwin Allen (“The Poseidon Adventure,’’ “The Towering Inferno’’), to become the Cecil B. DeMille of his generation, purveying jaw-dropping sensation yoked to cheap sentiment and appallingly (or is that appealingly?) flimsy characterizations.

Allen, after all, only turned an ocean liner upside down. In “2012,’’ Emmerich flips our entire planet on its head. The result is a state-of-the-art multiplex three-ring circus whose special effects stagger the senses and play like a video game, whose human drama aims for the cosmic and lands waist-deep in the Big Silly. Call it “Apocalypse Really Soon,’’ or, better yet, “Airport 2012.’’

What’s the rumpus? Not the end-times foretold by the Mayan calendar, but those darn solar neutrinos, streaming from the sun and heating up the Earth’s core to a point where the crust has broken free and the continental plates start doing a merry dance. A few teacups get chipped: California slides into the sea and Yellowstone Park blows straight up into the sky. And that’s just the opening act.

Emmerich and his co-writer Harald Kloser get the “science’’ of the movie out of the way fairly quickly, starting their tale in 2009 as US government geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) journeys to India to get a first-hand peek at the planetary core from the bottom of a copper mine. It may look like a giant Jacuzzi to you, but you’re not a scientist in a Hollywood movie.

Helmsley races back to Washington to warn President Wilson (kindly Danny Glover) and cabinet secretary Carl Anheuser (meanypants Oliver Platt) while “2012’’ races to introduce us to the rest of the movie’s overcrowded passenger list. A disaster movie needs an Everyman, so we have John Cusack as Jackson Curtis, a divorced dad and author of failed sci-fi novels that everyone in the film seems to have read.

Camping with his kids (Liam James and Morgan Lily) in Yellowstone brings Jackson in contact with both the geologist’s team and a conspiracy theorist (Woody Harrelson, mining his tabloid crackpot persona for all it’s worth) who explains everything and has a map for it. This cues the main action of “2012’’: Jackson, his estranged wife Kate (Amanda Peet), her plastic-surgeon boyfriend (actor-director Tom McCarthy, who must be wondering what on earth he stepped in), and the kids skedaddling from one literal hot spot to another as the ground caves in just behind them.
Much of the movie takes place in the air (the boyfriend’s an amateur pilot) as our plucky survivors barrel between tilting buildings and beneath collapsing freeways. The carnage in “2012’’ is distant and PG-13; Emmerich keeps us back from individual human suffering because that’s just not box-office. Civilization here is a high-end ant farm, and its death is the occasion for wonder, pity, and popcorn. We do zoom in on a few individual tragedies, most of which befall the ethnic and the old. The sinful, too: the pop moralism of “2012’’ isn’t far from that of the “Left Behind’’ series or any classic Hollywood western.

Glimpsed in the chaos of “2012’’ are some welcome hambones: Harrelson, as mentioned; the wattle-shaking Platt; George Segal as a cruise-ship entertainer who really should have called home earlier (one of the film’s many inadvertent laughs); Zlatko Buric as a corrupt Russian industrialist whose voice seems to emanate from a vodka-soaked crypt beneath the Kremlin; Beatrice Rosen as the industrialist’s goodhearted bimbo mistress, not quite as smart as her lapdog; the dog itself, who gets a hilarious scene toward the end and who in fact may be the Shelley Winters of this particular enterprise.

It’s the end of the world, and he feels fine. Page 46

Did I mention the airborne giraffes? Or the Tibetan Buddhists who join our heroes mostly to provide new age spiritual validation and a climactic thumbs-up? Or Thandie Newton as the President’s daughter, making goo-goo eyes at Ejiofor and struggling with the potted dialogue, which at times seems to have been poorly translated from the German? When Jackson and Kate stop in the middle of a cataclysmic deluge to discuss why their marriage failed, the melodramatic double-vision of “2012’’ turns actively ridiculous. Forget the Mayans  - Humphrey Bogart had it right: The problems of two people really don’t amount to a hill of beans in this movie’s crazy world.

Anyway, admit it, we’re here to see the Sistine Chapel come crashing down on thousands of screaming digital extras, or the Washington Monument totter and fall, or Caesar’s Palace tip into a fiery pit of magma (repent, ye weekend gamblers!). The attraction of disaster movies  - which by definition have to get bigger and bigger if we’re still to feel them  - is that they allow us to imagine our own extinction from the cheap seats, jolting us with spectacle, reframing our perspective, sending us home safe and sound.

In the wake of 9/11 (whose iconography this movie toys with in the form of collapsing skyscrapers and ash-covered faces), the need for entertainment apocalypse seems weirdly keener. “2012’’ is only a movie, and reassuringly so: It’s one huge, overlong, cornball Armageddon  - a work of shlock and awe. In one scene Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger is seen on TV declaring that “Da vurst iss ofah,’’ but he couldn’t be more wrong. Roland Emmerich is just getting started.

Don't worry, be happy: The dog survives in 2012  even though billions of people don't. The unfortunate masses  innocent as their four-legged fellow creatures but traditionally more expendable in disaster epics like this one  die in ways it takes Armageddon-movie master Roland Emmerich and a mighty army of CG artists to devise. For starters, Los Angeles cracks and falls into the sea, Las Vegas crumbles, Yellowstone National Park becomes a volcanic hellpit, India is devoured by a tsunami, and the Catholic faithful in Rome are buried under the rubble of their own magnificent church buildings. Cool! Oh, and also? A cruise ship on the high seas upends with a   harrumphing glug-glug, sinking to join its colleagues the Poseidon  and the Titanic .
God forgive me, but I enjoyed the nerve-racking silliness of this newest, loudest exercise in destruction. (And God help us all, now more than ever I think cities could crumble and oceans could rise.) Emmerich is, of course, an old hand at bangs, a manipulator who thinks whimpers are for sissies: Aliens tore up the place in Independence Day , an irradiated lizard stomped through Godzilla , global warming ruined everyone's plans in The Day After Tomorrow , and you don't want to know all the troubles the prehistoric hero known as D'Leh done seen in 10,000 BC . This time, as the story opens in 2009, the earth's core is heating up and acting all wonky, alarming an earnest U.S. government geologist (Chiwetel Ejiofor). He rushes to inform the White House chief of staff (Oliver Platt), who rushes to inform the President (Danny Glover), who eventually confides the news  to his tremulous daughter (Thandie Newton). Cut to three years later, and a California Everyman named Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) picks up his cute son and daughter (Liam James and Morgan Lily) at the home of his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and her new guy (Tom McCarthy). Jackson takes the kids camping at Yellowstone, where he meets a useful mountaintop crazyman (Woody Harrelson) who predicts the end of days.
The good news: Thanks to the crazyman, when the end of days begins to make itself known, the Curtis family (plus the ex-wife's new guy) are able to stay one step ahead of the abyss. This postnuclear clan has a terrific ability to drive on roads that cave in behind them, and fly (in half-borrowed, half-skyjacked airplanes) between toppling buildings, bridges, mountains, and fireballs. Enthusiasts of websites involving the Mayans' apocalyptic predictions are welcome to join enthusiasts of websites involving planetary instability to discuss the facts behind this chaotic fiction; biblical scholars are welcome to chime in on the meteorological conditions that coincided with the launch of Noah's Ark. Me, I'm more charmed by the now-classical way in which Emmerich uses scenes with human interest  you know, the introduction of a handful of characters we care about  to offset the sense-battering showpiece action sequences. (Those are usually the ''feelings'' scenes in which we laugh with nervous relief at the familiarity of human puniness.) Just ask Steven Spielberg: There's nothing like imminent destruction on a world scale to make a father want to heal a broken family.
Cusack, with his one-of-the-guys face and his nice way with child actors, does creditable work as an Average American Dad trying to put things right. Of course, Emmerich (and his co-writer, Harald Kloser, who also   co-scripted 10,000 BC ) is never one for subtlety. Average Dad's homegrown virtues are  contrasted with the thick-lipped, fat-bellied crudity and obscene wealth of a Russian oligarch (Zlatko Buric) looking out for his own two young sons. Meanwhile, as Commander-in-Chief (in the idealized mode of 24 's President David Palmer), Danny Glover is a good father to the country and his own daughter; however, we know his chief of staff is a cold SOB because he's distant from his aged mother.
As for Ejiofor's geologist, he gets to tell his dad he loves him before the end draws nigh. Which, in this rock-solid disaster-pic   formula, makes him the perfect character to deliver the climactic speech that unites mankind. Well, it's either him or the dog.


 I know what I have against Roland Emmerich — “The Patriot,” for starters — but what does he have against us? He’s bombarded Earth with alien death rays, big-footed it with a rampaging reptile and put it into deep freeze. Now in “2012,” his latest apocalyptic folly, he cracks the planet like a nut, splitting its crust, toppling its mountains and cities, and laying its every creeping thing to inevitable tedious waste.  Maybe he’s angry. (His last movie, “10,000 B.C.,” was widely panned.) To judge from the similarity with which he stages the multiple disaster sequences in “2012” — a limo, a camper, a plane, a bigger plane and some really big boats, by turns, race ahead of the impending doom — he seems exhausted. It’s no wonder. Finding newish ways to cram large-scale carnage into a PG-13 package is tricky. You need enough verisimilitude to hook the audience, but not enough to freak it out: the collapsing high-rises have to look real enough to be plausible, as do the itty-bitty computer-generated figures falling from them. Swirling dust and flying debris serve that commercial purpose, not rivers of blood and body pulp.  And so the dust swirls in “2012,” and debris and bodies fly, though at a careful distance. It all looks fairly convincing and also familiar: if you don’t repeatedly flash on Sept. 11, Mr. Emmerich will surely be disappointed. That gives the movie a cheap frisson, though the larger shivers are supplied by the onslaught of pricey special effects, which have grown predictably snazzier since his last cataclysm. Alas, the clichés of the disaster narrative remain in place. To that ruinous end, the larger catastrophe in “2012” functions as both the trigger and backdrop for a soap opera about a fractured family, standing in for the rest of humanity, which heals as the world falls apart. That’s the idea, anyway.  In truth, the central family here is as disposable as the billions of computer-generated humans that soon pile up after disaster hits. Written by Mr. Emmerich and Harald Kloser (they last collaborated on “10,000 B.C.”), “2012” takes its plot points and shifting plates from both science and fiction, and its title from doomsday prophesies, including a myth about the end of days derived from a reading of the Mayan calendar. Though not much is made of the Mayan angle, the most amusing character, a doomsday prophet and radio broadcaster played by Woody Harrelson, seems in hair, beard and interests to have been drawn along the predictive lines of the real author Daniel Pinchbeck (“2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl”).  Mr. Harrelson looks like he’s actually having the kind of good time stupid movies should provide but that this one roundly fails to deliver. Despite the frenetic action scenes, the movie sags, done in by multiple story lines that undercut one another and by the heaviness of its conceit. Humanity is dying, after all, as the television talking heads keep repeating, and while most of the dead are specks on the screen, Mr. Emmerich occasionally brings you close to the calamity. In one scene a musician (George Segal) calls his estranged son, but the phone is answered by the granddaughter he’s never seen. She’s cute, but then her house shakes and she’s gone, vaporized so that a sob can catch in Mr. Segal’s throat and ours.  There’s no time for real tears in movies of this sort, of course, though there’s plenty of space available for synergistic product placement, as evidenced by the Sony Vaio equipment that fills the government offices where the American president (Danny Glover) stoically stands by. Closer to the ground, another patriarch (John Cusack) plays his part as a divorced dad who will be enlisted for the usual heroics, while Amanda Peet rolls her eyes as his embittered ex. Depending on your tolerance for Mr. Cusack’s mugging, she has traded up or down by landing a plastic surgeon (Tom McCarthy). Completing this family portrait are two irritating children, a preadolescent boy (Liam James) and a younger girl (Morgan Lily).  Chiwetel Ejiofor, as some sort of wizard scientist, gets the chance to say “My. God.” several times in a credible American accent while the less-fortunate Oliver Platt plays a sleazy politician who’s equal parts devil and ham. Thandie Newton shows up as the president’s daughter who, because movies like these subscribe to the Noah’s ark theory of onscreen hookups (two of every kind), becomes an eventual romantic foil for Mr. Ejiofor’s character. Somewhere in the Himalayas a young Tibetan monk (Osric Chau) ponders the mysteries of life as his brother (Chin Han) heads off on a secret mission in China where salvation waits onscreen and, presumably, in that country’s contribution to the movie’s global box-office take.  “2012” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Old Testament-style destruction served with a smile.

The notion of playing God is implicit in the job of a film director, and rarely has the sense of a wrathful, vengeful deity at the helm, albeit a pagan one, been so comprehensively felt as in "2012.'' For demolition maestro Roland Emmerich, "Independence Day,'' "Godzilla'' and "The Day After Tomorrow'' were mere appetizers for the lip-smacking smorgasbord of global annihilation laid out here. This simultaneously spectacular and risible concoction looks likely to trigger a worldwide B.O. tsunami for Sony.
Hooking their doomsday scenario on an interpretation of a Mayan calendar that points to an earthly catastrophe in 2012 -- specifically on 12-21-12 (what movie will pin its release to that date?) -- Emmerich and writing-producing partner Harald Kloser begin by dumping Los Angeles into the sea and follow with the destruction of Las Vegas, Yellowstone National Park, Washington, D.C., the Vatican, India, Tibet and a giant cruise ship.
Anyone who stops to think about it between grabs of popcorn might pick up the hint that Emmerich is taking particularly gleeful aim at the United States (which other director has destroyed the White House in his films not once but now twice?) and Catholicism (he goes out of his way to detail the collapse of St. Peter's and Rio's Christ the Redeemer statue), while no other religion gets taken to task. But then, that would be taking this eye-popping display of movie pyrotechnics far too seriously. Or not.
Coming up with halfway decent characters with which to populate disaster films has always proved an almost insurmountable problem, but Kloser and Emmerich have brought a measure of wit to the enterprise. Pic's Everyman is Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a rumpled author whose most recent unsuccessful novel happens to have been called "Farewell Atlantis,'' and who never paid enough attention to sexy ex-wife Kate (Amanda Peet) and their two young kids (Liam James and Morgan Lily). He's now forced to look on as Kate shacks up with Gordon (Tom McCarthy) while he scrapes by as a limo driver for L.A.-based Russian billionaire Yuri Karpov (the very engaging Zlatko Buric).
As SoCal hopes for the best amid an alarming upswing in tremors and cracked streets, government scientist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) alerts U.S. President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover, almost too predictably grave) that increased solar fires (happily, for a change, not man-made global warming) are about to turn the Earth inside out in a way not experienced since the day the dinosaurs died.
While Wilson's chief of staff, Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt), readies the evacuation of the elite and the president deliberates about how to preside over the planet's final chapter, Curtis leads his kids on a series of escapes and near-misses worthy of Indiana Jones -- in a limo, RV, private plane (flown by nonpilot Gordon), giant Russian cargo jet and, ultimately, the biggest vehicle ever built. The action is preposterous by any standard, but that's designed as part of the fun; eye-popping indeed are the sights of the streets of Santa Monica rippling like so many ocean waves, molten meteors spewing out of Yellowstone, the sea claiming a ship the size of a football field and a six-engine jet crash landing on a Himalayan glacier.
Unfortunately, it's not easy scripting the final act of a movie about the end of the world when you don't really want the final image to be a charred rock. Let it be said that "2012'' plummets from reasonably distracting spectacle to sheerest silliness when, in the pointlessly protracted final reels, it tries to maintain interest in the (confusingly staged) jeopardy of a handful of characters when much of the world's population has already been wiped out or is about to be. Never has Rick's observation in "Casablanca'' been more true, that the problems of a few little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.
On any level other than as sheer visual sensation, "2012'' is a joke, for the simple reason that it has no point of view; the film offers no philosophical, metaphysical, intellectual and certainly no religious perspective on the cataclysm, just the physical frenzy of it all. But to ask this would be taking the picture far too seriously. Or not.
In Cusack and Ejiofor, "2012'' has two actors who convey above-the-norm intelligence for characters in this sort of fare, although even they can't keep up the pretense as the film degenerates. Most casting choices are agreeably offbeat down through the ranks, with Woody Harrelson supercharging his scenes as a wackjob radio sage who issues on-the-air reports from the front lines of destruction.
Except for some patchy work when St. Peter's crumbles, the visual effects are pretty sensational, delivering the cutting-edge CGI goods auds want and expect. It will be hard to watch "Earthquake'' ever again after this one.

Completing his multi-film vendetta against the world's tourist trade, German-born director Roland Emmerich  sends the mother of all storms to level the Washington Monument , the Eiffel Tower , and a priest-filled Vatican City , among other locales, in his newest end-times thriller, 2012 . From Independence Day  (1996) to The Day After Tomorrow (2004), taking down famous landmarks has become Emmerich's cinematic signature, but ever since summer audiences cheered the White House  being blown to bits by space aliens in the former, demolished historic sites aren't what they used to be.
2012  is alien-free, but there are tidal waves galore, as well as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and blinding dust clouds, all due to a sudden, radical heating of the Earth's core. A planetary realignment and an overstimulated sun are the villains in a scenario that a real-life seventh-century Mayan prophet is said to have predicted. So take note, humans: Life on Earth will end on December 12, 2012. Plan your Christmas shopping accordingly.
"It's kind of galling when you realize the nutbags with the cardboard signs had it right all along," declares Carl Anheuser  (Oliver Platt ), chief of staff to the president (Danny Glover ), as he watches news reports of panicked plebeians running from a shaking ground and thundering sky. Anheuser has been planning for the final day since 2009, when Adrian Helmsley  (Chiwetel Ejiofor ), a mid-level government scientist, thrusts a red-alert report into his hands at a fancy Washington party. Helmsley's dire warnings lead the world's superpowers to band together and secretly build six giant "arks" designed to save the rich, the powerful, and the mostly white from Armageddon. Launch site: China!
As if made by the gods to suffer for its movie-making sins, Los Angeles is the first city to split apart and slide (literally) into the sea. In a ridiculous but bravura sequence, Jackson Curtis  (John Cusack ), a failed sci-fi novelist/limo driver, begins his long, convoluted journey to China and those precious arks by dodging crumbling L.A. freeways and falling skyscrapers while his two kids, ex-wife (Amanda Peet ), and her new husband (Tom McCarthy ) scream in the limousine's backseat. The two-hour-and-40-minute 2012  is overstuffed with special-effects set-pieces, but the Curtis family's mad dash out of town is the closest the movie gets to actually being fun, if only because it's easier to relate to a man navigating bad traffic than one trying to outrun a newly formed volcano.
"How did they do  that?" is the question Hollywood  always wants moviegoers to ask, but in watching 2012 , I couldn't help but wonder if today's audiences, especially the very young, ask that question as often as those of the past. When the ill-fated cruise ship of The Poseidon Adventure  (1972)a film Emmerich and co-writer Harald Kloser  reference here more than oncewas capsized by a tidal wave, my 10-year-old self may have understood that flesh-and-blood stuntmen, not actors, were hanging off those upside-down cocktail tables, but I still feared for them and, by extension, for the film's characters. Today's CGI effects are undoubtedly more impressive, but also more soul-numbing. Millions of people die in this movieamong them a few we've come to knowbut not one of those deaths is affecting or memorable, even in an overly sentimental, B-movie way. Where is Shelley Winters  when we need her?
As with Emmerich's other films, what's likely to linger in the public memory is a singular scene of iconic destruction that has been the centerpiece of the 2012  ad campaign: The aircraft carrier USS John F. Kennedy , after being swept up by a gigantic tidal wave, flips over and comes crashing downbrief pause for ironyonto the White House. Goodbye, Rose Garden. One wonders: Is the disaster king suddenly getting political? Probably not. So for the widest audience possible, we suggest that Columbia Pictures  release an alternate take, with the democracy-crushing aircraft carrier this time being the USS Ronald Reagan .
