For the hordes of teenage girls who wore out the pages of Ann Brashares's 2001 young-adult novel ''The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants," I'll get the major change-ups out of the way: Tibby isn't petite and Lena's grandparents hate Kostas right out of the gate. Here's the biggest shocker, though: The movie version of ''Sisterhood" is otherwise sweet, wise, warm, and remarkably true to Brashares's characters and values. Men need not apply -- actually, teenage boys will probably gnaw their arms off to get away -- and the movie's much too mainstream to appeal to the art house crowd, but these are, by and large, good points. As female-bonding comfort food goes, ''Sisterhood" is that rare meal both adolescent girls and their mothers will be able to agree on.
The following plot synopsis is for those who have no idea what I'm talking about (the rest of you can drum your fingers in boredom and listen to Green Day sing ''Extraordinary Girl" again). It's the beginning of the summer, and four 16-year-old best friends in suburban Bethesda, Md., are parting company for the first time in their lives.
Beautiful, brittle Lena (Alexis Bledel of TV's ''Gilmore Girls") is going to stay with her grandparents on the Greek isle of Santorini. Bridget (newcomer Blake Lively) is a blond queen-bee jock headed for soccer camp in Mexico. Carmen (America Ferrera of ''Real Women Have Curves") is a budding writer insecure in body and mind; she's finally going to spend some quality time with her estranged father, Al (Bradley Whitford) in Charleston, S.C. Tibby (Amber Tamblyn of ''Joan of Arcadia"), the resident cynical punkette and the movie's closest approximation to an authentic teen rebel, is stuck working at the local chain megastore. She's also shooting a documentary about her summer that might as well be called ''Why I Hate Everything."
Oh, yes, the pants. Carmen has bought a pair of weathered thrift-shop blue jeans that mysteriously fit all four of the friends, and more discreetly radical than this borrowed bit of Latin American magical realism is the notion that girls (and women) come in all shapes and sizes, none of which are the Olsen twins.
So the pants, mailed from one girl to another every two weeks, become the link that connects them. There are additional rules -- no laundering, no double-cuffing, no letting anybody but you take them off. They could've added, ''No admitting the pants are a metaphor for life's unexpected growth experiences," but that would give the game away.
Under the functional, faceless direction of Hollywood vet Ken Kwapis, ''Sisterhood" splits into four narratives united by the girls' voice-over letters and the Federal Express delivery schedule. The quality of each plot tangent depends on the particular actress and predicament. For instance, timid Lena supposedly learns to loosen up and live a little when she meets a hunky Greek college student (Michael Rady), but Bledel is an actress of such porcelain precision that you don't buy the transformation. Anyway, that story line is pure Harlequin romance and a mere excuse to take in the Santorini sights -- not that there's anything wrong with that.
Over in Mexico, ''reckless" Bridget is chasing down a handsome 20-something soccer coach, Eric, (Mike Vogel) with a determination just this side of legal stalking. She gets what she wants but learns it doesn't bring her what she needs, a useful point the movie might've made more clearly if it weren't hellbent on staying in PG territory. (Something
 happens to Bridget, but younger audiences will be awfully fuzzy as to what.)
The best parts of ''Sisterhood" don't involve boys. Tibby finds her jadedness put to the test when she picks up an unwanted filmmaking assistant in Bailey (Jenna Boyd), a 12-year-old whose slightly creepy air of wisdom is a sure sign she's lunch meat. This doomed-angel shtick goes back through Louisa May Alcott and beyond, but the target audience doesn't know that, and they'll happily snuffle even as the rest of us resist the hospital deathbed scenes with all the will we humanly possess. Besides, Tamblyn gets interestingly quiet as Tibby is faced with another person's demise; she shows you a girl whose soul has just been read the riot act.
Best of all is Ferrera as Carmen, plus-size and hesitant and bursting with hope and hurt. Arriving in Charleston, she learns her father is about to marry the WASPy Lydia (Nancy Travis), who comes complete with two even whiter teenage kids of her own. Suddenly, Carmen has more in common with the cleaning lady than with her father, a development ''Sisterhood" makes with surprising force. The character has to learn to get angry at the right person (i.e., not herself) and then forgive that person, but Ferrera makes you forget any self-esteem sermonizing. She lets Carmen navigate each wave as it comes, sometimes going under but always swimming a little better.
None of this is groundbreaking stuff -- cinematically and narratively, it's two steps up from an ''After School Special" -- but neither does it need to be. Teenagers tend to assume that anything happening to them marks the first time it has happened to anybody, and so with these four and the people watching them from the audience. But that also includes any older sisters, mothers, aunts (or brothers, father, uncles) who remember their own adolescence. The unspoken assurance at the heart of this movie is that the pants fit everyone and the stories are endless.


         I hope this doesn't come across as hopelessly 
girly, but sometimes a teen is more than just a teen. Sometimes, she's a unique opportunity for synergistic emotional branding across a broad spectrum of media platforms.
 
  Written by Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler, and directed by Ken Kwapis, "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" is based on a successful book series by 'tween author Ann Brashares, former co-president and editor of a leading teen "concepting" company.
 


         






    Here, the concept is one-size-fits-all pants. Pants that accept, in other words. Pants that forgive.
 
  At a thrift store, just before embarking on their respective summer vacations, four best friends from fetus-hood (their mothers met in a prenatal yoga class) discover a pair of Levi's that fit them all perfectly. Because the girls span the body-type rainbow from endomorph to ectomorph, they decide the pants must be magical and agree to share them over the summer via airmail.
 
  Motherless Bridget (Blake Lively), a stunning blond soccer star looking for love in all the wrong places, goes off to soccer camp in Mexico; Lena (Alexis Bledel), a shy artist who keeps her hair and her feelings in a tight knot, departs for Greece; Tibby (Amber Tamblyn), an alienated surly type with blue streaks in her hair, stays home to work at the local mega store and finish her "suckumentary" on the banality of life; and chubby, insecure Carmen (America Ferrera), prepares to spend the summer with a twitchy Bradley Whitford, who plays the dad who left her and her mother when she was a kid.
 
  Sure, in real life, these four would have stopped acknowledging one another's existence in middle school, but in the movie, they're reassuringly inseparable, doing things like break into the yoga studio where their moms met, light candles and write a pants-sharing manifesto as the camera does laps around them in the incandescent glow.
 
  Over the course of the summer, the pants are repeatedly postmarked as Lena learns to relax and follow her heart, Mediterranean-style; Bridget learns to distinguish between love sex and neediness; Tibby learns that life is precious thanks to a tragic little girl (an adorably deadpan Jenna Boyd); and Carmen deals with her dad's big surprise. Whitford, meanwhile, acts as if he's been summoned to detonate a bomb while simultaneously sucking on a lemon and kicking heroin whenever he gets within five feet of Carmen. He looks uncomfortable, I mean. She's just so emotional
.
 
  Aimed at girls ages 9 to 15, "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" also displays excellent marksmanship in getting 'tweens of all ages and genders to sniffle audibly and hug in the dark (at least in the screening I attended). Having my heartstrings so relentlessly yanked made me want to just hand them over and get it over with, but "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" has its share of summery charms, including gorgeous postcard views of Santorini, an old-worldy Romeo-Juliet romance, and some particularly good performances by Tamblyn and Boyd. (I sort of wished the movie had just been about them.)
 
  It's the girly equivalent of a midsummer Bruckheimer extravaganza â€” a roller-coaster ride to the edge of total (emotional, natch) devastation that makes the happy ending that much more reassuring and cozy.

Rule No. 1 when discussing The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants : It's okay for a grown movie critic to admit she cried freely and with great feeling for more than half the movie, and grinned like a dork through the remainder. The sob-smiles flowed as 16-year-old Best Friends Forever Bridget (Blake Lively), Carmen (America Ferrera), Lena (Alexis Bledel), and Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) spend their first summer apart from one another, dealing with everything that's alternately thrilling (love) and seriously not fair (death) about life. Binding the quartet together is a magical pair of jeans, passed from friend to friend, that fits perfectly (also not fair) over their four very different-size butts.
Rule No. 2: It's okay to use tears and smiles, honestly evoked, as a measure of Pants ' warmth and effectiveness. Ann Brashares' super-selling young-adult novel became a hit because, although not every woman feels like a member of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, or the First Wives Club, or the Joy Luck Club, or is Waiting to Exhale, or Trying to Get Her Groove Back, every woman has, at one time, been 16 years old. TV-honed director Ken Kwapis (Malcolm in the Middle) knows this, and moves the action along with the same easy, frequent jumps between adventures that Brashares conjures on the page.
Rule No. 3: It's okay that the screenplay, by femme-flick pros Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler, diverges from the book, because the tone remains true to the seat of the Pants .
Rule No. 4: The more roles that go to the fresh, charming, untabloidy Pants  cast, the better. (That Tamblyn and Bledel happen to have TV identities as Joan of Arcadia and a Gilmore Girl is just...a bonus.) And as a subset of this rule: Ferrera, the great young star of Real Women Have Curves , can branch out whenever she likes. But the longer she goes on representing the interests of Hispanic Americans with such flair, and speaking out for young women who are totally at home in their full flesh, the greater the opportunity for women of all colors and sizes to see beauty on screen that looks like theirs. Ours.
Rule No. 5: Anyone who books a trip to the Greek island of Santorini after watching Lena bud and blossom with a first beau in the Mediterranean sun must confess, in writing, that it was The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants  that did the selling.

t seems churlish to be too hard on "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants," a fresh-scrubbed, eager-to-please movie based on Ann Brashares' best-selling young adult novel. Like the four teenage girls at its center, the film makes up in charm  what it lacks in sophistication. The sisterhood of the title is formed when the girls, best friends since childhood, are about to be separated for the summer for the first time. On a shopping trip, they find a pair of thrift-store jeans that mysteriously flatters all  of them, despite their different shapes and sizes. Deciding that the jeans must be magic, they make a pact to share them for the summer, each wearing them for a week  and then mailing them to the next friend. These peripatetic pants connect the  four separate stories as we follow the girls through their summer adventures. Carmen (America Ferrera), the writer of the group (who also narrates the film in voice-over), is the half-Puerto Rican child of divorced parents. She's over the moon about spending a summer alone with her father (Bradley Whitford), until she discovers that he's moved in with a lily-white Southern woman (Nancy Travis) and her two annoyingly perfect children. Painfully shy Lena (Alexis Bledel) is off to visit her grandparents in a village in Greece, while flamboyant Bridget (Blake Lively), a star athlete, is heading to soccer camp in Mexico. The cynical Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is the only one stuck at home for the summer, working at a Wal-Mart-like superstore and making a video "suckumentary" about all the losers in her hometown. Of these four plots, the story of Carmen's blended family is by far the most consistently engaging, largely because of the vibrant presence of Ms. Ferrera, who has been a talent worth watching since her film debut in 2002 in "Real Women Have Curves." The Lena and Bridget story lines, centered as they are on ill-starred puppy love, will have less emotional resonance for anyone over 12, while the tale of Tibby and her video documentary founders in bathos after the introduction of a dying child (Jenna Boyd) who slowly breaks down Tibby's sarcastic facade. "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" has plenty of plot twists that grownups will see coming a mile away, but that's no reason to deny its pleasures to the less jaded younger set. "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" is rated PG. It has some mild profanity and references to offscreen sexual situations.

Teenage girls get their "Waiting to Exhale" in "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants," adapted from Ann Brashares' popular juvenile fiction. This sentimental-in-a-good-way chronicle of four 16-year-old best friends' eventful summer apart mixes satisfying dollops of fun, tears, travel, romance and lesson-learning in a handsome package whose two hours pass faster than many a grownup entertainment. If it can withstand the first onslaught of bigger seasonal competitors, repeat biz might keep Ken Kwapis' ("Dunston Checks In," "Malcolm in the Middle") feature around long after school's out for the summer. 
Sticking fairly close to the 2001 novel, co-scenarists Delia Ephron and Elizabeth Chandler preserve its strengths as a complex adolescent soap opera leavened by humor, warmth and empathy.
Prologue's tone portends a more syrupy melodrama than thereafter delivered. Mercifully brief setup establishes protags as fated to be friends even before birth, a bond only strengthened by such formative challenges as losing parents to divorce or death.
Mildly punky Tibby (Amber Tamblyn) is the cynical rebel. Lena (Alexis Bledel) is a wallflower aspiring artist. All-American blonde Bridget (Blake Lively), left alone with a distant father after her beloved mother's demise, uses aggressive flirting and athleticism to dull the pain. Good-humored Carmen (America Ferrera), a budding writer and the pic's narrator, has learned to roll with the punches since dad left.
This summer marks the first time the inseparable four will spend significant time apart. But before they scatter, the girls find a pair of magic blue jeans in a store -- magic because they perfectly fit each differently sized heroine. Empowering the duds with 10 rules evoking good luck and good behavior, the quartet vow they'll swap the pants long-distance until reunited.
Bulk of story then intercuts between the principles on their separate summer vacations. Lena visits grandparents on a Greek isle, where she meets dashing university student-cum-fisherman Kostas (Michael Rady). Unfortunately, their families have a long-running feud with each other.
Bridget finds her own slightly-older man in Eric (Mike Vogel), a dreamy young coach at the Baja soccer camp where she's a show-offy star player. He's initially taken aback by her shameless pursuit, then relents. This provides pic an (offscreen) "first time" that's cause for regret (though not excess moralizing), as Bridget realizes sex won't chase away her suppressed grief over maternal abandonment.
Carmen, despite mom's (Rachel Ticotin) misgivings, traipses off to South Carolina, where she'll stay with the father (Bradley Whitford) she's seen too briefly and infrequently since their divorce. But upon arrival he springs several dismaying surprises: He lives with uber-perky Lydia (Nancy Travis) and her two kids, and he's about to marry her. While superficial efforts are made to include Carmen, she becomes all too aware that this squeaky-clean new family views her as an intruder.
Nascent filmmaker Tibby is the only one still stuck at home in Bethesda, Md. (as portrayed by Vancouver). She resigns herself to working at the local jumbo-store (refreshingly not used for a marketing tie-in) while spending spare time on a video "suckumentary" indicting the supreme lameness of everything and everyone. But her nihilism is slowly eroded by 12-year-old Bailey (Jenna Post), a gregarious pest who appoints herself Tibby's assistant while hiding a darker secret.
Latter plot thread lays siege to the tear ducts in the final reel. There's also some heavyhandedness in the way that every time wee Bailey and, to an extent, grownup Kostas, opens their yaps, a life lesson plops out.
But in general, "Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" respects the intelligence of its audience (and lead characters), refusing to condescend or oversimplify. While there are wish-fulfillment aspects to some narrative turns, tale manages overall to uplift without suggesting the road from girlhood to womanhood is -- or even should be -- easy. Parents will appreciate positive messages more firmly couched in adolescent reality than those in producer Debra Martin Chase's "Princess Diary" films.
Talented young lead thesps are spot-on, though Ferrera's ("Real Women Have Curves," "Lords of Dogtown") vivacious naturalness makes her scenes especially winning. Adult characters are drawn in broader strokes, but well cast.
Gae Buckley's production design, Lisa Jenson's costumes and John Bailey's widescreen lensing (Greece has never looked so well-scrubbed) make fine contribs in a package deftly turned in all departments. As one might expect, the soundtrack relies on shoehorned pop tunes to a sometimes intrusive degree, though it could have been worse.
Original scribe Brashares has already sequelized "Sisterhood" in print twice, leaving no lack of material for potential filmic follow-ups.

Rock of underages: Kids get Zap-tized by tyrannical tutor
The short-fused motormouth who runs the Paul Green School of Rock Music , an after-school program for nine-to-17-year-olds in Philadelphia , has claimed, not unreasonably, to be the inspiration for Jack Black 's character in School of Rock. But where Richard Linklater 's movie approached its central incongruityÂ—the idea that anti-establishment rock can and should be schooled Â—with a breezy mix of ironic farce and fuck-the-Man feelgoodism, Paul Green , the frustrated musician and self-proclaimed "really good teacher" at the center of this documentary, embraces the same philosophy with grim, cranky resolve. Students like Madi, a Quaker folkie, and Will, the resident depressive, attest that rock school is a misfit sanctuary and that Green's manic tantrums serve a motivational purpose. In any case, as Will deadpans, "It's a lovable quirk that he's mentally disturbed."
But with his Hannibal Lecter  impersonations, Vietnam  P.O.W. re-enactments, and borderline abusive teasing, Green tends to be more actively unpleasant than amusing. He almost gets misty-eyed envisioning a 2007 issue of Rolling Stone : "Where did all these bands come from? All of a sudden they start tracing stuff back to me." Given that Green's curriculum is even more ossified than his fictional counterpart's, this immodest forecast assumes the resurgent popularity of Frank Zappa -style art-prog. There's plenty of talent on displayÂ—12-year-old guitar prodigy CJ kills every time he's onÂ—but as the kids dutifully make the pilgrimage to Germany 's tribute-band Zappanale, it's depressingly clear whose dreams they're acting out. (Is it really fair to be force-feeding drug music to listeners who aren't, um, properly equipped to enjoy it?) Don Argott's lively documentary, ostensibly a paean to alternative pedagogy, extends its subject a long leash, and he in turn does his damnedest to sabotage the project. Rock School ends up being a movie about just how little fun rock 'n' roll can be.
