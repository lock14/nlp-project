Mr. Magorium�s Wonder Emporium
 is more than just a movie. It�s a whole world of magic, delight, and whimsy. It�s a wonderfully whimsical place where toy dinosaurs and sock monkeys come to life, where there are entire rooms filled with rubber balls bouncing all the time, where kids can run and scream and squeal to their hearts� content and play Duck, Duck Goose with real geese. Mr. Magorium�s Wonder Emporium
 has whimsy coming out of its ears. The man behind the man behind the onscreen emporium is writer/director Helm, the creator of 2006�s Stranger Than Fiction
, which was also whimsical but had the common decency to be cynical as well and to co-star Emma Thompson, who made smoking look more essential to a full and happy life than any actor since Humphrey Bogart. Now the brakes are off, however, and Helm can feel free to give voice to all his passion for childlike eccentricity without all the baggage that comes with making a movie for adults. What he�s come up with is a toy store run by a gleeful 200-year-old man-child (Hoffman), whose greatest joys are seeing kids indulge their imaginations and impersonating Willy Wonka. At his side are Molly Mahoney (Portman), a former child-prodigy piano player who has since grown up into simply a piano player, with little hope in the future or belief in herself; Eric Applebaum (Mills), a precocious 10-year-old with a passion for funny hats and no friends his own age; and Henry Weston (Bateman), an accountant who wears a tie to work, meaning he�s lost touch with his inner child (God bless him). Rounding into his third century on the planet, Mr. Magorium decides he�s going to check out of this life but not before making sure all of his charges have redeemed their miserable little souls by giving themselves over to the joys of childlike wonder. With his incessant cackling and jigging and adorable lisp, Hoffman is an unbearable force of nature, while Portman is disappointing as a young adult stuck in neutral; you can�t help thinking there would have been more life to her character if she and Helm had bothered to think for a minute about all the grown-ups who are going to be dragged to this thing again and again, world without end. The film�s one saving grace is Bateman, the only actor on set who seems unwilling to give himself over to Magorium�s philosophy that the key to a fulfilling life can only be found in pathological regression. Maybe he just needs more whimsy in his life.


"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium" is about a magical toy shop, but it has some of the sadder moments I've seen in a movie all year. Take the scene where the toy shop's sprightly clerk (Natalie Portman) asks the accountant (Jason Bateman), on the premises to assess the shop's worth, if he sees any sparkle in her. He can't. No twinkle either. She should consider the source, and yet he's not entirely wrong. For the first time I can recall, Portman's sparkle is forced.
This movie, which Zach Helm wrote and directed, is having the same conversation with us. We're all accountants; Helm lives in a toyshop; and for the 90 or so minutes "Mr. Magorium" drags on, he keeps interrupting his tale to ask us to stop and smell the cuteness. Of course, the more the movie insists on imparting its lessons for living - "Your life is an occasion. Rise to it" or "What you need to believe in is you" - the more you feel like an accountant and the less ashamed you are.
This feels like both Wes Anderson on training wheels and severely medicated Roald Dahl - be happy or else - with Dustin Hoffman doing Mr. Magorium as a kind of doddering Willy Wonka. (You can imagine Bill Murray doing a nastier, boozier version for Anderson.) Hoffman is fun. He bops around the sets with his hair teased out and gelled (with, what, Krazy Glue?) and wears snazzy, well-tailored suits. One of the happiest sights in the whole movie is the soft-shoe he does on a sheet of bubble wrap. That's heaven to me. And since the emporium feels cramped and overstocked with stuff and kids (it's like half shop, half day care), all the wonder in the movie is Hoffman's.
The vividness is theatrical as opposed to cinematic. The camera seems to fly around the inventive sets but visually the store never comes to life. It is, however, alive and extremely unhappy that its ancient owner (he's 243 years old, but doesn't look a day past 67) wants to pass it on to Mahoney, the chic but uncertain second-in-command Portman plays. The closer we come to Mr. M's last day, the grayer the emporium's colors become. Eric, the store's 9-year-old clerk, played by Zach Mills, suspects this graying might have something to do with the appearance of Henry, that sparkle-blind accountant.
For reasons only a bully could explain, this bright, intelligent, extremely likable child is friendless. In one of the movie's two best scenes, he follows his mother's instructions and tries to make a buddy. He chooses Henry. They write notes and hold them up to a window. The boy invites the man to play checkers. The man writes that he's working. The boy responds, how about when you're not working. And the man writes - with the camera getting in good and flagrantly tight on Henry's tablet: "I never stop working." The scenes between Mills and Bateman are wonderful because they're the actors whose connection transcends Big Themes.
The movie is rather selective in its disdain for toil. Mr. Magorium's been working for 113 years! Of course, Magorium loves his work and brings pleasure to others. That seems lost on Henry. Look at those drab suits. A happy laborer wears seersucker (Dustin, where can I get one?). Obviously, the movie aims to change that. But Helm is maddeningly indiscreet about the correction. He thinks in large type and skywrites all the ideas. His screenplay for last year's "Stranger Than Fiction," also about a dud accountant who discovers the meaning of fun, did the same. (Dustin Hoffman was having as good a time in that movie, too.)
"Mr. Magorium" is a far less aggravating experience. Just like the previous movie, this one fetishizes literariness, genius (Bateman talks to an Einstein doll), and the surrealism of René Magritte. But Helm places an actual child at the center of this picture as opposed to a metaphorical one. Even then, the film is inert and self-doubting. Its insecurities do it in. If a director more or less has to ask, "Does this movie make me look magical?," the answer is definitely no.


In an age of belt tightening, Dustin Hoffman's hair in Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium  looks like the result of a budget cutback on makeup and costumes. It's as if the actor took his normally thatchy coif, poured about half a bottle of mousse onto it, mussed it up with his fingers until he looked like Arthur Rubinstein with bedhead, and voilà!  instant wacky toy-shop owner! The characterization is every bit as cheap. Mr. Magorium, who is 243 years old (so are his jokes), is a cross between Willy Wonka and Geppetto, but Hoffman plays him with little more than a goofy dumb lisp, achieved by tucking his lower lip under his upper teeth, so that he looks just as rabbity-stoopid as he sounds.
In the Wonder Emporium, the toys all have prankish lives of their own  which could have been fun, in a Harry Potter  meets Flubber  sort of way, except that when you actually see the playthings (a mobile with real wriggling fish! Bouncy balls that try to escape!), they don't look fun at all. Magorium is planning to hand over the shop to his assistant, an underachiever with self-esteem issues (Natalie Portman), and that's the entire movie: Will she step up and take over? The store, too, is alive, and it's possible that audiences will respond to the special-effects magic that results in one of the walls turning gray. Then again, they may want to save their enthusiasm for the moment when Magorium, really letting go now, does a happy little jig. Atop a sheet of plastic bubble wrap!

 “Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium” is the only family film I can recall whose title character muses out loud about “King Lear” and the finality of death in language that wouldn’t be out of place in a college Shakespeare course.  What does King Lear have to do with Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman), the 243-year-old proprietor of a magic toy store that opened its doors 114 years ago? You could describe them both as crazy sane. Mr. Magorium’s high-flown tangents suggest that the movie, a fantasy pitched mostly to 6-year-olds, also seeks to impress their 60-year-old grandparents with its zany erudition.  A benign, avuncular dreamer with mad-scientist hair who keeps a pet zebra, Mr. Magorium resembles a superannuated Pee-wee Herman with a deeper voice. Mr. Hoffman’s studied performance in this seriously weird movie refrains from Hermanesque extremes but is engaging nonetheless.  The storekeeper’s message to children is a variation of the old Peter Pan dictum that magic, if it is to exist, requires that you believe in it with all your heart. Stuffed with enough toys to fill several department stores, his shop suggests a surreal enlargement of Pee-wee’s Playhouse by way of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” It is wonderful indeed, and you wish the movie had spent more time simply wallowing in it.  An embodiment of the unfettered imagination, it is a place where every item, from the adorable stuffed animals to the self-propelling tops, is alive and kicking, swooping, swirling and spinning. When a customer requests an item, a clerk consults a giant alphabetized book of inventory, and on the appropriate page, a whole little world pops out. One of the store’s most heartening qualities is its dearth of war toys and sexy dolls. Mr. Magorium’s signature plaything is a paper glider that, once deployed, keeps sailing around the room.  “Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium” was written and directed by Zach Helm, whose previous major credit was the screenplay for the Will Ferrell comedy “Stranger Than Fiction,” which envisions a sophisticated adult version of the same kind of magic. But if the concept is ingenious, its execution is erratic. The story is arbitrarily divided into chapters of varying length that have no clear beginning, middle or end, and the movie’s narrative drive is sporadic.  The story finds Mr. Magorium planning to leave the world because he is down to his last pair of the shoes he has stockpiled for decades. He intends to leave the store to his devoted clerk and right-hand woman, Molly Mahoney (Natalie Portman), a once-promising classical pianist and composer who lost her inspiration. But when he announces the bequest, she balks, believing she lacks the power to keep the store alive. (One of the movie’s weaknesses is Ms. Portman’s attitude of disengagement. Even when magic is all around, the sparkle in her eyes is dim.)  Mr. Magorium engages an accountant, Henry Weston (Jason Bateman), whom he calls Mutant, to go through years of erratic bookkeeping, determine the store’s value and help arrange its passage into Molly’s hands. A prototypical uptight numbers cruncher, Henry seems like the last person in the world who would understand what the store is about. With the emporium’s future up in the air, its most devoted customer (and the movie’s narrator), Eric Applebaum (Zach Mills), a shy, lonely 9-year-old, makes a pitch for it.  In the most exciting scene the store, sensing its days are numbered, rebels and stages a full-scale temper tantrum. The toys turn on the customers (not violently, I hasten to add), and nothing works as it should. After the tantrum subsides, the magic rapidly dissipates. The brightly colored walls warp and turn black, and the place eventually resembles a charred ruin in which nothing stirs.  But not to worry. One tiny spark of faith is all it takes to revive a magic toy store.  MR.

Genial and G-rated, this fantasy from screenwriter/first-time director Zach Helm ("Stranger Than Fiction") sprinkles in charming moments but ultimately doesn't evoke enough wonderment to overcome its tongue-twisting title and completely win over adults along with kids. Given the dearth of quality family fare, Fox and Walden might drum up nice business, but holiday shoppers at this emporium should be advised that the merchandise is limited in scope and ambition and thus more suited to the specialty realm than franchise-oriented spectacle.
Consciously aspiring to a fairy-tale feel, "Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium" deserves credit not so much for originality but simply for being original, as opposed to derived from a book, toy or game. (Several real toys, such as Slinky, are incorporated into the action, but this mercifully isn't one of those movies where the licensing cart seems to be dragging the horse.)
As if to cement its storybook credentials, the movie is partitioned into chapters and narrated by a young boy ("Hollywoodland's" Zach Mills) in "Once upon a time" fashion.
Beginning in the middle, we're introduced to Mr. Magorium (Dustin Hoffman), the 243-year-old proprietor of a wondrous toy store. With a hairdo borrowed from Christopher Lloyd's "Back to the Future" mad scientist, Magorium is cheerfully planning to depart this plane and pass the baton of responsibility to his protege Mahoney (Natalie Portman), a one-time piano prodigy who has found refuge managing the shop. The emporium is also frequented by young Eric (Mills), a quiet and awkward kid with a fondness for hats but no real friends his age.
Into this whimsical world Magorium summons Henry (Jason Bateman), an accountant charged with determining the store's value. Like the mom in "E.T.," Henry either can't see or isn't open to the magic all around him, from the owner's pet zebra to the stuffed animals that playfully assume a life of their own.
The idea of toys coming to life is hardly a novel one, any more than is a fanciful character (think Willy Wonka) seeking an heir to perpetuate his life's endeavors. Helm nevertheless approaches the material with a strong sense of conviction, trying to convey the emporium's magic through a child's eyes while providing heart-warming dialogue that deals, albeit gently, with such fundamental issues as celebrating life and embracing death as merely the next grand adventure.
The movie sputters, though, to the extent its key players (and there are just four) and situations come across as slightly half-baked, including the unconvincing prospect that the emporium might be in real jeopardy in Mahoney's care. Just as her self-doubts about soldiering on without Magorium don't entirely compute, the same goes for Henry, whose big heart is barely concealed beneath a slightly stuffed shirt.
Portman is appropriately waif-like and winsome, while Hoffman brings considerable warmth to the pivotal role, as merry as Scrooge on Christmas morning. Yet with his cartoony voice that at times irritatingly sounds inspired by Paul Winchell's dummy Knucklehead, a little of Magorium goes a long way, including his zany penchant (adopted by Mahoney and Eric) for calling Henry "Mutant" because, to him, it's a handy substitute for "accountant."
Nor does the movie conjure much technical wizardry until the climactic sequence -- a moment buoyantly punctuated by Alexandre Desplat and Aaron Zigman's score -- despite the inviting combination of anthropomorphic toys and appreciative wide-eyed children.
"Mr. Magorium" unabashedly yearns to rouse the child in all of us, and it's easy to root for such amiable intentions. Where the movie finally falls short is in the gap between telling you a miraculous place exists and actually making you feel as if you've gone there.

Writer-director Zach Helm 's amiable but nerveless kids' movie, about a 243-year-old toy-store owner (Dustin Hoffman  in shell-shocked hair, a purple suit, and an annoying lithp) preparing to hand over his unusual business, begins with a bracing meditation on the inevitability of death. With that, the film grows tediously familiar, stuffed with PSAs about the importance of belief and the life you make for yourself until the time comes to croak without fuss. This falls on the deaf ears of the unfulfilled souls who most need to hear it: Mr. Magorium's existentially stalled manager, Mahoney (Natalie Portman ); Eric (Zach Mills ), a nine-year-old collector of kooky hats; and the Mutant (Jason Bateman ), a buttoned-down accountant who knows nothing of love or play. All very sweet, but where do you take a movie without noticeable adversaries beyond the enemy within? The only creature worth rooting for is the emporium itself, a charmingly anarchic showcase for misbehavior by the kind of hand-made toys only scads of cutting-edge CGI could bring to life. Helm's pacing is as pallid as his palette is vivid, and for a movie that celebrates wonder and strangeness, the whole enterprise feels coy and half-baked.
