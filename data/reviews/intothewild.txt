Occasionally, I'll pass a homeless person who is obviously a slumming middle-class kid in nose rings, and when I do, I generally have to stifle the desire to bark out something like ''Go back to Seattle!'' I felt stirrings of that sentiment during the early scenes of Into the Wild , Sean Penn's adaptation of the Jon Krakauer best-seller  a true-life adventure that is really a descent. The film is set in the early '90s, when Christopher McCandless (Emile Hirsch), who is just out of college, leaves the privileged life he has known to become a self-styled vagabond. He exits his existence, donating his savings ($24,292) to Oxfam, dropping out in the style of a '60s hippie-tramp who's trashed all ambition.
Here, though, there is no counterculture to second his voyage. He's spiritually out on his own. Christopher isn't rebelling against anything too remarkable. On the road, he gripes about the evils of ''society,'' and he nurses family wounds: the father (William Hurt) who was a materialist, and violent, too; the mother (Marcia Gay Harden) who enabled him. Playing this bitter young dreamer, Emile Hirsch is baby-faced and placid, with serious knitted eyebrows and a pouf of George Michael-in-the-wild hair. Sexy, with an entitled aura, he could almost be part of Vincent Chase's entourage. I thought: What does this dude have to escape from? What is his problem ?
The beauty of Into the Wild , which Penn has written and directed with magnificent precision and imaginative grace, is that what Christopher is running from is never as important as what he's running to . He craves splendor and risk, a  way of shaking off his suburban numbness. And he craves it so badly that he gets addicted to it. He's a Gen-X Candide who blends striving with flaming out until you can't tell the difference. Wandering the desert with a volume of Thoreau in hand, kayaking his way down the Colorado River without rowing skills (or a permit), finally voyaging into the mountains of Alaska, as far from humanity as he can get, he takes a journey of recklessness that maybe only a privileged kid could have imagined. Yet there's a bravery to its indulgence. He's going nowhere, just living, maybe dying  and embracing the adventure.
Into the Wild  delivers his journey to your senses. It's an intensely physical movie, yet it's never just  physical. Every image (rivers, highways, icy mountains) tells its own story  of a terrain that must be met, and then conquered. The people Christopher meets, and touches, along the way are as much a part of the trip as his crash course in wilderness survival. Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker as hippie wanderers, Hal Holbrook (in a luminous performance) as an old man cocooned in his loneliness  these are quietly distressed hangers-on of the sort you rarely see in movies. You can feel Penn, along with his hero, struggling to locate a hidden America. Into the Wild  is a little too long, yet Christopher's deliverance, in a rusty abandoned ''magic bus'' in Alaska, has a darkling purity that will haunt anyone willing to take the trip.

 There is plenty of sorrow to be found in “Into the Wild,” Sean Penn’s adaptation of the nonfiction bestseller by Jon Krakauer. The story begins with an unhappy family, proceeds through a series of encounters with the lonely and the lost, and ends in a senseless, premature death. But though the film’s structure may be tragic, its spirit is anything but. It is infused with an expansive, almost giddy sense of possibility, and it communicates a pure, unaffected delight in open spaces, fresh air and bright sunshine.  Some of this exuberance comes from Christopher Johnson McCandless, the young adventurer whose footloose life and gruesome fate were the subject of Mr. Krakauer’s book. As Mr. Penn understands him (and as he is portrayed, with unforced charm and brisk intelligence, by Emile Hirsch), Chris is at once a troubled, impulsive boy and a brave and dedicated spiritual pilgrim. He does not court danger but rather stumbles across it — thrillingly and then fatally — on the road to joy.  In letters to his friends, parts of which are scrawled across the screen in bright yellow capital letters, he revels in the simple beauty of the natural world. Adopting the pseudonym Alexander Supertramp, rejecting material possessions and human attachments, he proclaims himself an “aesthetic voyager.”  Mr. Penn serves as both his biographer and his traveling companion. After graduating from Emory University in 1990, Mr. McCandless set off on a zigzagging two-year journey that took him from South Dakota to Southern California, from the Sea of Cortez to the Alaskan wilderness, where he perished, apparently from starvation, in August 1992. “Into the Wild,” which Mr. Penn wrote and directed, follows faithfully in his footsteps, and it illuminates the young man’s personality by showing us the world as he saw it.  What he mostly saw was the glory of the North American landscape west of the Mississippi: the ancient woodlands of the Pacific Northwest, the canyons and deserts farther south, the wheat fields of the northern prairie and Alaska, a place that Mr. McCandless seemed to regard with almost mystical reverence. Mr. Penn, who did some of the camera work, was aided by the director of photography, Eric Gautier, who previously turned his careful, voracious eye on the wilds of South America in Walter Salles’s “Motorcycle Diaries.” That movie, like “Into the Wild,” finds epic resonance in a tale of youthful wandering and proposes that a trek through mountains, rivers and forests can also be a voyage of self-discovery.  Mr. Salles’s film, in which Gael García Bernal played Che Guevara, found a political dimension in its hero’s journey. And while Chris’s fierce rejection of his parents’ middle-class, suburban life contains elements of ideological critique, Mr. Penn and Mr. Krakauer persuasively place him in a largely apolitical, homegrown tradition of radical, romantic individualism.  An enthusiastic reader (with a special affinity for Tolstoy and Jack London), Chris is in many ways the intellectual heir of 19th-century writer-naturalists like John Muir and especially Henry David Thoreau, whose uncompromising idealism — “rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth” — he takes as a watchword. (Had he survived, Mr. McCandless might well have joined the ranks of latter-day nature writers like Edward Abbey and Bill McKibben.) His credo is perhaps most succinctly stated by Thoreau’s mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, who advised that “the ancient precept, ‘Know thyself,’ and the modern precept, ‘Study Nature,’ become at last one maxim.”  One problem with this strain of American thought is that it sometimes finds expression in self-help nostrums and greeting-card sentiments. “If you want something in life, reach out and grab it,” Chris says to Tracy (Kristen Stewart), a teenage girl who develops a crush on him, collapsing Self-Reliance into something like an advertising slogan. But the movie’s theme, thankfully, is not so simple or so easily summed up in words.  Mr. Penn, even more than Mr. Krakauer, takes the Emersonian dimension of Chris McCandless’s project seriously, even as he understands the peril implicit in too close an identification with nature. The book took pains to defend its young protagonist against the suspicion that he was suicidal, unbalanced or an incompetent outdoorsman, gathering testimony from friends he had made in his last years as evidence of his kindness, his care and his integrity. The film, at some risk of sentimentalizing its hero, goes further, pushing him to the very brink of sainthood. After Chris offers wise, sympathetic counsel to Rainey (Brian Dierker), a middle-aged hippie he has befriended on the road, the older man looks at him with quiet amazement. “You’re not Jesus, are you?” he asks.  Well no, but it’s a comparison that Mr. Penn does not entirely discourage. (Note the final, man of sorrows image of Mr. Hirsch’s face and also an earlier shot of him floating naked in a stream, his arms extended in a familiar cruciform shape.) At the same time, though, “Into the Wild” resists the impulse to interpret Chris’s death as a kind of martyrdom or as the inevitable, logical terminus of his passionate desire for communion with nature.  Instead, with disarming sincerity, it emphasizes his capacity for love, the gift for fellowship that, somewhat paradoxically, accompanied his fierce need for solitude. Though he warns one of his friends against seeking happiness in human relationships — and also rails incoherently against the evils of “society” — Chris is a naturally sociable creature. And “Into the Wild” is populated with marvelous actors — including Mr. Dierker, a river guide and ski-shop owner making his first appearance in a film — who make its human landscape as fascinating and various as its topography.  The source of Chris’s wanderlust, and of the melancholy that tugs at the film’s happy-go-lucky spirit, is traced to his parents (William Hurt and Marcia Gay Harden), whose volatile marriage and regard for appearances begin to seem contemptible to their son. (His feelings for them are explained in voice-over by his younger sister, Carine, who is played by Jena Malone.)  Fleeing from his mother and father, Chris finds himself drawn, almost unwittingly, to parental surrogates: a rowdy grain dealer in South Dakota (Vince Vaughn), a retired military man in the California desert (Hal Holbrook) and Rainey’s companion, Jan (Catherine Keener), who seems both carefree and careworn.  Chris reminds some of these people  of their own lost  children, but all of them respond to something about him:  an open, guileless quality, at once earnest and playful, that Mr. Hirsch conveys with intuitive grace. “You look like a loved kid,” Jan says, and “Into the Wild” bears that out in nearly every scene.  He is loved, not least, by Mr. Penn, who has shown himself, in three previous films (“The Indian Runner,” “The Crossing Guard” and “The Pledge”) to be a thoughtful and skilled director. He still is, but this story seems to have liberated him from the somber seriousness that has been his hallmark as a filmmaker until now. “Into the Wild” is a movie about the desire for freedom that feels, in itself, like the fulfillment of that desire.  Which is not to say that there is anything easy or naïve in what Mr. Penn has done. “Into the Wild” is, on the contrary, alive to the mysteries and difficulties of experience in a way that very few recent American movies have been. There are some awkward moments and infelicitous touches — a few too many Eddie Vedder songs on the soundtrack, for example, when Woody Guthrie, Aaron Copland or dead silence might have been more welcome — but the film’s imperfection, like its grandeur, arises from a passionate, generous impulse that is as hard to resist as the call of the open road.  “Into the Wild” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has profanity, brief nudity and some violent or otherwise upsetting scenes.

Jon Krakauer's bestseller "Into the Wild" chronicled the real-life, way-off-grid adventures of Christopher McCandless, a middle-class college grad whose quest for "ultimate freedom" ended in 1992 with starvation in the Alaskan wilderness. It seemed natural, if challenging, screen material -- and in his fourth and by far best feature turn behind the camera, Sean Penn delivers a compelling, ambitious work that will satisfy most admirers of the book. Early-fall prestige entry's wider prospects will depend on careful momentum building from reviews and word of mouth, with repeat young-adult biz likely if it doesn't get pushed off screens too soon.
In some ways, adapter-director Penn has made a lyrical youth-rebellion flick in the classic late '60s/early '70s mode, or at least something that will be interpreted as such by viewers who'll buy the ecstatic aspects of McCandless' odyssey. Others may find the character, portrayed by Emile Hirsch, annoyingly over-endowed with undergraduate self-righteousness, borrowed ideals and resentment toward (who else but) mom and dad.
Penn's precise view of him is ambiguous. With its slow-mo scenic rhapsodies, the film does seem a bit less questioning of its protag's motives and wisdom than Krakauer's book. But both tome and pic tell a fascinating tale, with room for myriad personal interpretations.
After graduating from Emory U. in 1990, 22-year-old Virginian McCandless felt he'd completed his duty to the parents (Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt) whose expectations he'd often chafed against, and left Atlanta without telling them or even sibling Carine (Jena Malone). They soon discovered he'd given away his entire remaining educational fund of $24,000 (slated for law school) to charity; his car was later found abandoned in the Arizona desert. The McCandlesses notified law enforcement around the country and hired a private detective.
But Christopher, now calling himself "Alexander Supertramp," didn't want to be found. He stayed on the move,living off the land and pickup jobs, pursuing a romantic freedom fueled by the writings of Tolstoy, Thoreau and Jack London. His goal was to live in complete isolation in the Yukon -- a "great Alaskan adventure" that proved thrilling but ultimately tragic.
Penn cuts throughout among the protag's solo Alaskan months, brief glimpses of his formative years and vignettes from the time spent tramping in between. These vignettes emphasize significant if passing friendships made on the road: a middle-aged hippie couple (Catherine Keener and Brian Dierker) who take a parental interest; a genial, hard-drinking South Dakota farmer (Vince Vaughn); a flirtatious girl (Kristen Stewart) living in a SoCal countercultural community; and finally, a retired Army man and widower (Hal Holbrook) who comes to think of this tumbleweed as the grandson he never had.
There are also less pleasant interludes, from a few bleak hours being down and out in L.A. to a violent removal from a freight train. But greater perils await in Alaska, where all his survival skills are put to the test -- and, finally, can't win over merciless Mother Nature.
The book drew on many voices to piece together the story. At first, Penn deploys too many tactics in an attempt at a similar effect: There's Carine's voiceover narration, spoken excerpts from the subject's often pretentiously self-aggrandizing journals, onscreen text and section titles ("Chapter 3: Manhood"). But eventually, they all work together well enough.
Likewise, the lengthy pic never feels overlong despite repetitious moments here and there (a few too many lyrical montages, occasionally over-indulged actor riffing). But the excessively mannered touches that flawed Penn's prior, features ("The Indian Runner," "The Crossing Guard," "The Pledge") are mostly MIA. "Wild's" style and substance feel more organically linked; pic also has more room for humor and warmth.
"Into the Wild" feels heavily influenced by Terrence Malick, for whom Penn acted in "The Thin Red Line." While this pic's poetic flights may not be up to that film's masterful level, it is certainly more satisfying than "The New World."
Hirsch, who's shown impressive range in various TV and lesser-seen film projects ("The Mudge Boy," "Lords of Dogtown"), easily holds the screen in this demanding role. If his McCandless comes off as a bit blank-slate, that's appropriate for a man-boy whose unshakable convictions are mostly of the kind that grow more malleable with age and experience.
Keener, Dierker, Vaughn and Holbrook etch memorable characters. Harden and Hurt aren't given enough screen time (or much dialogue) to clarify whether their son judged them rashly or justly as hypocrites. It's unclear whether Stewart means to be playing hippie-chick Tracy as vapid, or whether it just comes off that way.
Shot in a great many U.S. locations tracing the subject's actual travels, the physically impressive production is highlighted by Eric Gautier's widescreen lensing and an original score of acoustic alt-rock Americana, with new songs by Eddie Vedder generally fitting in well.

To some, the story of Christopher Johnson McCandless , the 24-year-old Emory University  graduate who starved to death in the Alaskan wilderness in the spring of 1992, will never be anything more than a case of a spoiled bourgeois brat with half-cocked survivalist fantasies (and possible suicidal tendencies) who ran away from home and got exactly what he deserved. To others, McCandless stirs up thoughts of the intrepid explorers who once ventured forth into undiscovered lands, and of the wanderlust, the rage against the societal machine, and the thirst for what the author Jon Krakauer  has termed "raw, transcendent experience." So what if all the earthly frontiersthe physical ones, anywayappear to have been conquered?
At the time of its 1996 publication, Krakauer's book about McCandless, Into the Wild , sparked a predictable array of love-it-or-hate-it reactions. It is to the credit of Sean Penn  that his film version will provoke no less animated a debate about its subject, and about its very existence as a moviewhich can be construed as a further cashing-in on the McCandless family's tragedy, or as the ideal vessel for a story about one man's communion with the last remaining wide-open spaces of the American West.
To these eyes, Into the Wild  is an unusually soulful and poetic movie that crystallizes McCandless in all his glittering enigma, and allows us to decide for ourselves whether he was the spiritual son of Thoreau, Tolstoy, and John Muir , or the boy most likely to become Theodore Kaczynski .
Like Krakauer, Penn has conceived McCandless's story in road-movie termsa new-millennium Easy Rider  that opens with McCandless (played by Emile Hirsch ) embarking on the Alaskan pilgrimage that was to have been the final leg of a two-year transcontinental adventure. Then the film loops back to McCandless's college graduation and his attempt to pacify his parents (Marcia Gay Harden  and William Hurt ) by promising to apply to Harvard Law . But no sooner does McCandless toss his mortarboard hat into the air than he sets about the symbolic desecration of credit cards and ID, the donation of his entire life savings to Oxfam , and the severing of all ties with family and friends.
In between those bookends, Into the Wild  takes to the highways and back roads of places named Niland, Carthage , Slab City, and Oh My God Hotsprings, capturing a vivid panorama of burnouts, dropouts, and other self-proclaimed "tramps" who have gone in search of something moreor lessthan mainstream society can afford them. As I write that, I realize it risks making Into the Wild  sound like two and a half hours of hippie-dippy philosophizing courtesy of one of conservative America's favorite Hollywood -liberal punching bags. But Penn's film burns with native intelligence, never tipping too far into hagiography, and always doing what very few purveyors of McCandless's story have been able or willing to do: engaging with him on his own terms.
As screenwriter, Penn has done a superb job of giving shape and dimension to characters who passed only fleetingly through Krakauer's pagesthe fellow travelers McCandless encountered on his journey and whose lives, in some cases, he irrevocably altered. They include the South Dakota  grain-elevator operator Wayne Westerberg  (Vince Vaughn ); the neo-hippie earth mother Jan Burres  (Catherine Keener ), who sees in Chriswho was by then calling himself Alexander Supertrampthe ghost of her own estranged teenage son; and the octogenarian widower Ron Franz , played by Hal Holbrook  in a performance that is as much a thing of beauty as any of the film's ravishingly photographed wide-screen western vistas.
Penn also seems more engaged with the language of cinema here than he has in any of his previous directorial efforts (which include the excellent The Pledge  and the overwrought The Crossing Guard ). He freely toys with form (multiple narrators, passages of text scrawled across the screen) in a way that sometimes feels self-conscious, but which lends Into the Wild  the sense of experimentation that emboldened the great American films of the 1970s. It is a feeling enhanced by the presence of several original songs composed and performed by Eddie Vedder , which do not merely regurgitate the story of the film but in fact are integral to the telling of it. Most of all, Penn allows Hirsch the space he needs to build a performance of enormous physical and psychological rigor.
The criticisms of Into the Wild  are easy to anticipate. Is the movie too long? Probably, at least by that hallowed yardstick that says a film must move rapidly from point A to Bsomething McCandless himself was in no hurry to do. Is it less than judicious with respect to McCandless's parents and sister, who exist in the film mostly as fragments of memory, phantoms of a discarded existence? Arguably so, until you consider that, during his entire two years on the road, McCandless failed to place so much as a single phone call home. Part of the enduring fascination with McCandless, of course, is that his story tends to mean considerably different things depending on where you're standingwhether you are parent or child, restless wanderer or happy conformist. Penn's triumph is that he manages to see McCandless as both boy and man, prophet and fraud, vagabond and visionary. Which is, I suspect, awfully close to how McCandless saw himself.
