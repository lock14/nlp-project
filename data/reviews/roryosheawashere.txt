         "Rory O'Shea Was Here" is a shameless heart-tugger of considerable appeal that, like many movies that start off with much going for them, could have been so much better had its makers aimed higher.
 
  The yearning of two severely disabled young men to live in an apartment with the help of a personal assistant, instead of in an institution, is a solid premise, but director Damien O'Donnell and his writers too often defy credibility by injecting action into their comedy-drama in an effort to rev up viewers' emotions. Such blatant moves undercut a pair of quite affecting and persuasive portrayals from James McAvoy and Steven Robertson, plus staunch support from Romola Garai as the young woman whose help they enlist.
 


         






    McAvoy's handsome Rory, age 20, with trendy spiked and peroxided hair, is stricken with muscular dystrophy that has left him able to move only his head and two fingers. Intact, however, are his cheeky personality and foul mouth. For him life has been reduced to a constant act of defiance. It's immediately clear that he's going to be a cross to bear for Brenda Fricker's Eileen, the no-nonsense director of a high-grade home for the disabled.
 
  Rory sets about venting his frustrations on Robertson's Michael Connolly, a sweet young man with cerebral palsy that has rendered his speech all but unintelligible. Defying probability, Rory quickly starts understanding what Michael struggles to say. They form a bond, with Rory inspiring Michael to rebel against what Rory sees as the dulling effect of an institutionalized life.
 
  But the film does not play fair with Eileen. It's true that when she brings in as entertainment a third-rate cabaret entertainer who delivers "He's Got the Whole World in His Hands" with unalloyed smarminess, the effect is both hilarious and sad. Nevertheless, it is not necessary to invest Eileen with Nurse Ratched tendencies to motivate Michael and Rory's growing desire to live on their own. (That Fricker should be cast as Eileen only serves as a reminder of how much better a film is 1989's "My Left Foot," which brought her an Oscar for her portrayal of the loving, strong mother of Daniel Day-Lewis' cerebral palsy-stricken writer.)
 
  The way Rory maneuvers a flat for himself and Michael is inspired, and the byplay between them and Garai's Siobhan, whom they've hired as their caretaker, is amusing and harrowing — the heart of the film.
 
  Yet even here the filmmakers don't trust the strength of their material, or the talent and skill of their actors. They throw in a reckless high-speed spin that Rory takes in someone's car — how he manages to pull it off is left off camera because it's so implausible. And the dangerous street chase Rory stages, outmaneuvering some neighborhood kids in his high-powered wheelchair, is too unsettling to be an effective or credible expression of an exuberant free spirit.
 
  "Rory O'Shea Was Here" is, in short, wildly uneven, constantly veering between honest emotions and insights and bald manipulation and contrivance. The result is that McAvoy's brave but irresponsible Rory, Robertson's gradually flowering Michael and Garai's caring and capable Siobhan are all performances that are far more effective than the film as a whole.

Nothing exploits prejudice against people with disabilities quite like a didactic sentimental movie designed to combat prejudice against people with disabilities. The moment we meet the title character of Rory O'Shea Was Here , we know just what he's about. Rory (James McAvoy) has gelled spiky hair, a nose ring, and a mouth that won't stop berating people with cutting Irish wit. He also has muscular dystrophy, and from where he sits, in his wheelchair-with-headrest (his body is immobile except for two fingers on his right hand), the world is a cheap and patronizing place. I wonder what he'd have to say about this movie? At a residential home, Rory meets Michael (Steven Robertson), a young man with cerebral palsy who speaks in a yowling, stretched-out gargle that no one but Rory can comprehend. He becomes Michael's buddy and ''translator,'' and the two split for Dublin, where they land in a spiffy color-coordinated flat. But will they be accepted for who they are?
Considering that director Damien O'Donnell and screenwriter Jeffrey Caine never stop defining them by their afflictions, I'm not sure they'll have much of  a chance. Rory, as a character, belongs to an honorable film tradition of bitter yet sensitive handicapped rebels who don't want your pity, man. Yet as charming a devil as the actor James McAvoy may be, the movie gives Rory,  in his defensive brashness, no layers, no dimension of personal dream. There's a dreadful subplot in which Rory and Michael hire a caretaker (Romola Garai) who looks like Kate Winslet crossed with Drew Barrymore, and we're meant to think, ''Gee, the poor blokes, having to be around such a winsome sex-bomb lass!'' Didn't it occur to the people who made this movie that men in wheelchairs have girlfriends too? Rory O'Shea Was Here  gazes at the physically afflicted and just about begs for our sympathy long after we've grown restless and eager to feel something else.

tuffed with treacle and moral uplift, the new Irish film "Rory O'Shea Was Here" sounds sweet enough to rot your teeth. Consider the possibilities and try not to wince: two physically disabled young men break from their institutional confines and wheel their way into the good graces of all they encounter. Yet despite the periodic twinkling, the occasional detours into sentimentality and, most egregiously, the syrupy soundtrack that threatens to engulf the story at every turn, "Rory O'Shea Was Here" is better than the usual three-stage journey of courage, heartbreak and redemption. In this case, the triumph of the human spirit comes with a small bitter chaser. Key to the film's modest success are its performances, notably from the leads, Steven Robertson as a long-term institutional resident named Michael Connolly, and, in particular, an estimable James McAvoy as the titular renegade who introduces rebellion into the Carrigmore Home for the Disabled. Overseen by clucking, professional worriers (played by Brenda Fricker, among others), Carrigmore is silent as a tomb, and about as much fun, when Rory arrives one afternoon, hair arranged in artfully pomaded spikes. Stricken with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a degenerative disease that affects the voluntary muscles, this 20-year-old has lived much of his  life in a wheelchair, one that most of his caretakers would clearly prefer to keep in permanent park. But as Michael and the rest of the Carrigmore crew shortly discover, to both their delight and mounting alarm, Rory is anything but confined. Free-wheeling and blissfully foul, he ventures into territory that the able-bodied take for granted, like the local pub, where he hits on women and picks a fight with a drunk because Rory is young and bored and restless, just like everyone else. There's more to his rebellion, as Jeffrey Caine's screenplay gradually makes clear. In essence, a two-hander about a pair of irrepressible spirits, "Rory O'Shea Was Here" also carries a forceful argument about the rights of the disabled in between its melodramatic peaks and valleys. For Rory, raging against suffocating institutional benevolence isn't just a matter of punk posturing; it is a question of human dignity. Directed by Damien O'Donnell, "Rory O'Shea Was Here" doesn't offer many surprises, either in narrative or aesthetic terms, though it does provide an unexpected diversion with an attractive caretaker (Romola Garai). Mostly, though, the film presents the story of two men who face life the way real people do, with glints of anger, eddies of frustration and, every so often, a sense of existential futility. These two wear neither halos nor holy smiles. And, in contrast to the spoiled, overage children who populate our screens and were hideously ubiquitous at the recent Sundance Film Festival, where "Rory O'Shea Was Here" played, the young heroes of this small, emotionally satisfying movie are not after our pity. Be prepared, however, if you end up giving them a few of your tears. "Rory O'Shea Was Here" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has some salty language, most of which will be very familiar to teenagers and child sophisticates.
Let it be said that this affirmational Irish comedy (released back home aswait for itInside I'm Dancing ) does not hesitate to deploy archetypes in order to swat at stereotypes: When the young rebel Rory O'Shea  (James McAvoy ) tears into the Carrigmore Home for the Disabled and meets introverted fellow wheelchair user Michael (Steven Robertson ), the spiky-haired tearaway becomes Randle McMurphy  to Michael's Billy Bibbit, Angelina Jolie  to his Winona Ryder . Rory has a rapidly degenerative form of muscular dystrophy, while Michael's cerebral palsy badly impedes his speech, but with Rory acting as translator and enabler, the guys soon break out of stir, obtaining their own bachelor pad and an earthy aide, Siobhan (Romola Garai ). Michael pines for their comely assistant, though the filmhelmed with sitcommy anonymity by Damien O'Donnell  (East Is East )mostly flinches from the able-disabled divide in their relationship. Plotted at neck-wrenching right angles (there's an estranged-Dad subplot lumpily folded in) and leaky with bathos, Rory O'Shea Was Here  is a plea for equality of opportunity, a worthy objective somewhat obscured by non-disabled actors occupying the lead roles. In any case, one imagines Rory himself would prefer a Farrelly disability blooper reel.
