When word went out that this remake of Robert Wise's sci-fi classic was in the works, a hue and cry arose from those who have kept watching the skies since the golden age of the Cold War-era science-fiction film. Admittedly, I was among those whose first thought was, "Why?" and whose second thought was, "Keanu Reeves?!" Seriously, it didn't sound like a smart move in any
 direction when announced, and, unsurprisingly, this loud, hammy, and, above all, pointless do-over only serves to point out the genius of the original. Screenwriter David Scarpa sticks to the rudiments of Edmund H. North's 1951 script but garnishes the film's overriding and still-resonant message with wooden warnings from the equally wooden Reeves and then ladles on the CGI destruction to little effect. Wise's film had a stately elegance, with Michael Rennie's interplanetary message-bearer Klaatu eliciting genuine pathos while Patricia Neal and Hugh Marlowe acted exceedingly human
 throughout. (It also had one of Bernard Herrmann's eeriest and most memorable musical scores.) Reeves displays precious few emotions and even less acting. He plays the character of Klaatu (who is, lest we forget, the potential destroyer and/or savior of all mankind) as though he were on robo-pilot, and the whole characterization comes off as a bad, possibly ironic riff on Hugo Weaving's vastly more entertaining Agent Smith of The Matrix
. Keanu stalks, Keanu glowers, Keanu has a giant robot christened "Gort" by the U.S. armed forces, but he's no Michael Rennie. Connelly does her best as the sci-gal whose rocky relationship with her preteen stepson eventually leads to tears, hugs, and the redemption of all mankind (maybe). But even she � or a stern Bates or a decidedly unsilly cameo by Cleese � can't save this dull, unnecessary film from its total lack of "Gosh, wow!" sense of wonder. Wipe �em out, Gort.


"Gort, Klaatu barada nikto."
That dialogue, from 1951's "The Day the Earth Stood Still," has served generations of movie fans as a secret handshake, an in-joke nod to one of the greatest of '50s alien-invasion movies. In the new remake of the same title, Keanu Reeves delivers the line - I think - buried under pounds of goopy exo-skeleton and with his voice digitally altered. Something has been lost in the translation, and it's not just the script.
But how do you breathe life into this property after everything from "Close Encounters" to "Independence Day" has had its way with it? More crucially, why? Directed by Scott Derrickson ("The Exorcism of Emily Rose"), the new "Day" gets off to a solid start, with a huge alien spacecraft landing on the Eastern seaboard. The location is now New York's Central Park and the UFO is a glowing sphere, but the humanoid Klaatu (Reeves) and his ginormous metal robot, Gort, still stride forth to warn humanity that its days are numbered.
Back in the 1950s the peril was nuclear Armageddon; these days it's the environment. So "The Day the Earth Stood Still" shares with "WALL-E," "The Happening," and other recent pop jeremiads the certainty that the planet has met the enemy and it is us. "If the earth dies, you die," Klaatu intones. "If you die, the earth survives." One question: For a movie so worried about junk, why is McDonald's
 getting such blatant product placement? (An entire scene is set at a highway Mickey D's, with loving camera-pans of the logos.)
Chased by the paranoid minions of the US Secretary of Defense (Kathy Bates with unfortunate hair), Klaatu hits the highway with a mournful astro-biologist (Jennifer Connelly) and her fatherless stepson (Jaden Smith, Will's kid), who initially thinks the only good ET is a dead one. They briefly stay over with an Important Scientist, played by John Cleese in what amounts to the criminal waste of a major Monty Python alumnus, and Klaatu has to decide whether to unleash a swarm of voracious metallic locusts to scrub the earth back down to ground zero.
Those nano-bugs are pretty neat, but they can't save "The Day the Earth Stood Still" from heading south in a hurry. Reeves plays Klaatu with one unchanging facial expression - that's in his range, admittedly, but even Jeff Bridges had more to work with in "Starman" - and the film makes the grave mistake of neglecting Gort, squirreling the cyborg behemoth away in an underground bunker for much of the running time. When a remake wastes the big robot, you know you're in trouble.
There are explosions and flipping cars, but the 1951 original still did far more emotionally with less digitally. Above all, the new "Day the Earth Stood Still" lacks the courage of its own eco-pessimism, and the final scenes play like a rushed, embarrassed concession to our need for happy endings, no matter how far-fetched.
According to a press release, Twentieth Century Fox and the privately held Deep Space Communications Network will start beaming "The Day the Earth Stood Still" beyond our solar system today. Man, are we asking for it.


In the 1951 sci-fi classic The Day the Earth Stood Still , a flying saucer lands in Washington, D.C., and Gort, the robot who emerges from it, emits a ray that makes guns and tanks vanish; he's like the patron saint of all those hippies who stuck flowers in rifle barrels. The best thing in the movie is Michael Rennie, who as the courtly extraterrestrial diplomat Klaatu exudes the sad yet deeply expressive charm of a haunted Peter O'Toole. In the expensive but plodding new remake, the spaceship  now an ethereal globe  lands in Central Park, and Gort isn't so lovey-dovey; he's like a super-tall, obsidian Oscar statue wreaking havoc. As for Klaatu, he's now played by Keanu Reeves, who speaks every last line in a deliberately blank take-me-to-your-leader monotone that makes him sound like a kid imitating the rote sci-fi aliens of the '50s Michael Rennie transcended. Reeves seems to be trying to wriggle out of the charge that he's a flat actor by acting flat on purpose. But in The Day the Earth Stood Still , he is  flat. And boring. And so is the film.
Once again, the intergalactic travelers have come to Earth bearing a message  only here, it's an all-too-predictable environmental one. On the run with a benevolent scientist (Jennifer Connelly), Klaatu warns that if we don't change our ways, he and his fellow visitors will destroy the human race in order to save the planet. (Call it the General Westmoreland school of green activism.) Reeves and Connelly aren't asked to portray romantic feelings; they aren't asked to do much besides stare glumly at one another as they attempt to escape the military forces on their trail. The original Day the Earth Stood Still  had a paranoid poetry that lifted the audience up even as it warned the world to come together. This one is so dour it just comes off as a scolding. C–

 Long after we are gone, science fiction movies about our impending extinction will instruct whoever comes next that we were a strange, neurotic species indeed. We could not — cannot — get enough of fantasies of destruction, meant at once to inflame and soothe our fear of vanishing altogether, whether through war, ecological catastrophe, disease or alien invasion.  We know we have it coming, and a movie like “The Day the Earth Stood Still,” either in its 1951 version or in the “reimagining” that opens Friday, invites us to feel fleetingly bad about that even as we are encouraged to laugh it off. The laughter — at the earnest reckoning occasioned by a weary-looking extraterrestrial and his giant robot; at the panic and distress their visit provokes — serves as a necessary balm. Like other overwhelming emotions, the fear of apocalypse becomes more palatable when it is turned into camp.  The old “Day,” made early in the atomic age, has long inspired this kind of laughter. It has also, in part because of its expressive, shadowy black-and-white cinematography, retained a measure of haunting, unsettling weirdness.  Any hope that the new “Day,” directed by Scott Derrickson from a script by David Scarpa, might also someday rise above its pulpy, corny, somber silliness rests mainly on the shoulders of Keanu Reeves. Those shoulders are perfect for filling out a dark, narrow suit, just as Mr. Reeves’s deadpan basso and permanently perplexed features make him an ideal Klaatu, as the space visitor is called. Klaatu’s job is to assist, calmly and methodically, in the extermination of the human race, a task he tries, with evident fatigue, to explain to his hysterical, violent would-be victims.  Only one will listen:  Dr. Helen Benson, played with a bit too much ennui by Jennifer Connelly. Helen, an expert in astrobiology, is part of a team of scientists taken into government custody by force when a giant orb seems about to crash into the Earth. Instead it lands in Central Park, disgorging that giant metal Cyclops robot (a near replica of the one from the earlier movie) and poor Klaatu.  The secretary of defense (Kathy Bates, with Hillary Clinton’s demeanor and Sarah Palin’s hair) responds with military force, which only speeds the process of humanity’s annihilation and demonstrates that our executioners may have a point. We’re such a brutal, dumb, incorrigible life form that the only way the planet can survive is if we’re no longer on it. (In 1951 the case against us was mainly pacifist. Now the anti-militarism has a more urgent and explicit ecological dimension.) A metastasizing swarm of metal bugs — the best special effects in a movie that often looks cheap and bedraggled — is dispatched to eat us and everything we’ve made, or at least everything on the New Jersey Turnpike.  But wait, Helen pleads. We can change! To provide evidence of this transformative potential she takes Klaatu to see her mentor,  Professor Barnhardt (John Cleese), a scientist who listens to Bach and was awarded a Nobel Prize for “altruistic biology.” Apparently this is the Swedish Academy’s euphemism for pimping: the good doctor’s advice to Helen about how to approach Klaatu is to “persuade him not with your reason, but with yourself.”  Still, any movie that awards a former Monty Python cast member a Nobel Prize in anything cannot be all bad. And “The Day the Earth Stood Still” could be worse. Its scenario and many of its scenes feel ripped off rather than freshly imagined — why do aliens always seem to end up in New Jersey? — and the relationship between Helen and her stepson, Jacob (Jaden Smith), does not quite add the necessary element of heart-tugging sentiment.  After “Wall-E” and “I  Am Legend” and the dozens of apocalypse flicks since the last “Day the Earth Stood Still” we can surely do better. Even Klaatu looks bored and distracted, much as he did back when we knew him as Neo.  “The Day the Earth Stood Still” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).

This botched remake of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" seriously dishonors the seriously fine 1951 sci-fi landmark on which it's based. While technically proficient, the new entry has not benefited from the kind of deep think necessary to justify a reworking, as the once-bracing premise of a superior power holding Earthlings to account for their misbehavior now seems familiar -- if still valid -- from numerous interim fantasy and disaster pictures. Decent opening biz will surely plummet once the holidays pass.
Robert Wise's original film was based on a provocative screenplay by Edmund H. North, itself derived from the 1940 story "Farewell to the Master" by Harry Bates, which goes uncredited here. Pic arrived on the early cutting edge of '50s sci-fi, effectively embodied early Cold War military jitters and proposed the notion that, short of a deity that might impose order, it might take an alien threat of annihilation to force humanity to stop squabbling and get its act together. The black-and-white feature was also graced by some unforgettable images, notably involving the sleek flying saucer that landed in the mall in Washington, D.C., and its occupants: the immaculately accoutred Klaatu, played by Michael Rennie, and his robot guardian Gort. Topping it off was a chilling Bernard Herrmann score.
One of the new film's many sins is its lack of any primal, defining imagery. Instead of a flying ship, Klaatu (the sufficiently alienesque Keanu Reeves) and his soldier (a skyscraping, perfectly sculpted male form with a destructive ray emanating from its noggin) emerge from a vaguely defined glowing sphere that lands in Manhattan's Central Park.
Naturally, the Army's first impulse is to shoot Klaatu and ask questions later. Unfortunately, the script by David Scarpa ("The Last Castle") rotely retains key elements from the original -- the U.S. government's refusal to grant Klaatu's request to speak with world leaders, a widow and (step)son as key contacts for Klaatu, the latter's chat with a like-minded genius, all original screenwriter North's idea -- without giving them any interesting twists.
The widow this time, Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly), has been upgraded to a Princeton prof and high-end scientist, while her black stepson, Jacob (Jaden Smith), keeps missing his dad, who was killed in Iraq. Lots of military bluster, personified by brass-balls Secretary of Defense Regina Jackson (Kathy Bates), keeps the hardware and special-effects team busy, but as the story increasingly focuses on Helen, Jacob and Klaatu mucking about in the foggy forests of New Jersey, the more it's apparent Scarpa and director Scott Derrickson ("The Exorcism of Emily Rose") are lost in the woods themselves.
So many other, potentially more exciting roads could have been taken. Instead of denying Klaatu access to the United Nations, why not let him present his message and see where the chips fall? This is a global story, after all, so why not, in this era of globalization, genuinely make it one? There could have been three, four, five or more Klaatus -- one for every continent -- and the film could have intercut the fateful ramifications of differing international responses to his arrival.
Innumerable other dramatic possibilities lie latent in the basic material, but the filmmakers timidly ignore them in favor of sticking with very dull versions of the original film's characters. Even when Klaatu is persuaded to alter his dim view of humankind's potential to transform itself, it's unconvincingly motivated.
The performers all seem left to their own devices and appear very far from their best. David Tattersall, who shot the three "Star Wars" prequels, seamlessly melds the live-action with the extensive visual effects, which were handled mostly by New Zealand's WETA Digital. Given limited motivation by the lackluster action, Tyler Bates' score is several notches above the norm for big effects-driven pictures.


As in the original 1951 film by Robert Wise  (and more or less ignoring Harry Batess original pulp short story Farewell to the Master), the arrival on Earth of a near-omnipotent being named Klaatu (Keanu Reeves ) is met with a trigger-happy response. Only the widowed Dr. Helen Benson  (Jennifer Connelly ) has faith that making friends with the alien might be in the best interests of humanity. But she may not be correct: Unlike Michael Rennies mostly benevolent Klaatu, version 2.0 is pissed at humanity for trashing the planet, and comes prepared to wipe us all out. The problem with this new The Day the Earth Stood Still  isnt so much in the execution of director Scott Derrickson , who pulls off quite a few compelling sequences and, best of all, doesnt screw around too much with Klaatus giant robot Gort (at least until Gort suddenly turns into a cloud of tiny robot insects that arbitrarily eat whatever the plot calls for). No, the problem here is that there are no big ideas: The original Day  was both a condemnation of Cold War military paranoia and an allegorical Christ tale, with Klaatu dying for our sins before being resurrected and ascending into the heavens, warning that hell be back with the apocalypse if humanity doesnt shape up. There are plenty of ways to bring similar themes into play here: Klaatu as Bush figure, perhaps, invading because of our weapons of mass destruction? Instead, its never clear quite what his problem is.
