         Elijah Wood has eyes like klieg lights, and to look at them directly for too long is to fear for your corneas, and to wonder what exactly is going on in that sizable but delicately featured head of his. For orbs so distinctive, they are oddly blank and mesmerizing. You half expect his irises to start swirling if you fix on them for too long.
 
  In Liev Schreiber's "Everything Is Illuminated," Wood's eyes seem to take in everything and reveal nothing. Which may have been the idea. Wood plays Jonathan Safran Foer, an aspiring writer and namesake of the author of the book on which the movie is based, who travels from Brooklyn, N.Y., to the Ukraine to find Augustine, the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis.
 


         






    To this end, the fictional Jonathan engages a travel agency catering to "rich Jews searching for their dead families," as Alex Perchov (Eugene Hutz), reluctant third-generation scion of Heritage Touring, describes the family business. A break-dancer in a Kangol cap, whose mangled English is rendered even more florid and unruly thanks to a gift thesaurus, Alex has been coerced by his father into serving as Jonathan's questionable guide and translator, even though he'd rather stay in Odessa, frequenting "famous nightclubs" and "getting carnal" with girls. Having come of age in the post-Soviet era, Alex can't fathom why Jonathan would embark on such a "rigid search" for a ghost when he could have stayed in America — a place Alex very much wishes he could visit.
 
  A contemporary folk tale about the Holocaust and Jewish diaspora, Foer's novel is also concerned with memory; the exponentially incremental nature of cause and effect; displacement; the impossibility of arriving at the same truth from different points of departure; and the bearing of the past on individual identity, among other things. In the book, chapters of Jonathan's magical-realist epic-in-progress alternate with Alex's record of their trip and his subsequent letters to Jonathan critiquing the work and offering his version of the story.
 
  In other words, it's an impossible book to adapt, and Schreiber wisely doesn't try to cram everything into his lean and visual script. Eliminating all but Alex's account of the road trip as it unfolds — the story follows Alex, his grief-stricken grandfather, his grandfather's dog, Sammy Davis Junior, Junior, and Jonathan as they set out to find Augustine armed with nothing more than the name of a shtetl
 (Trachimbrod) and a faded photograph — Schreiber takes Foer's sprawling, multilayered, multigenerational beast and hones it into a post-Glasnost buddy picture; a polished nugget of a road movie, focused mainly on Alex and Jonathan's growing sense of identification with each other and with their origins. The director also leaves the story on the happy note that Alex would have wanted, which suits an author-tweaking meta-narrative like this one. As critic Roland Barthes said, "It is language which speaks, not the author."
 
  Like Foer, Schreiber dabbles in styles (some carnivalesque scenes feel borrowed from Fellini, and moments of expressionistic deadpan from Kubrick); but in a script so lean and spare, the stylistic visual flourishes sometimes threaten to overwhelm. Some, like the one in which Jonathan visits his sick grandmother in an all-white room, feel forced and mannered. Others, though, radiate with a stark brilliance, such as the scene in which the threesome drives past a huge, bombed-out building that looks as if it may have once housed a major bureaucracy. "What is it?" asks Jonathan. "Soviets," replies Alex. "What happened?" asks Jonathan. "Independence," says Alex.
 
  Perhaps the biggest departure from the book — and it may be more a function of the art form than authorial choice, but probably both — is that the movie lets us have a good, objective look at Jonathan: bespectacled, phobic, vegetarian, dressed in a dark suit like a 1950s insurance salesman and too archly self-aware to participate in his own life, which he prefers to preserve, scrap by scrap, in Ziploc baggies. Trinkets, playing cards, cigarette butts, used condoms, potato wedges, bridgework — anything that can carefully be sealed in a sandwich bag gets tacked to a wall in his room on which each member of the Foer family, living and dead, is represented by a framed portrait and a plaque. Jonathan obsessively collects, catalogs and archives his life as though it were already past.
 
  Hutz's Alex, meanwhile, is a prism reflecting received notions and amusingly distorted ideas about American culture. Hutz, a first-time actor better known for his Ukrainian Gypsy punk New York-based band, Gogol Bordello, grew up in the Ukraine, and drew on his own observations of how America was perceived in the Soviet bloc, as well as on his own experiences with surviving repression through insane, unwarranted optimism.
 
  The contrast between Jonathan and Alex, while funny in the book, is starkly illuminated by the movie. Schreiber presents the two as poster children for Cold War notions of national character, only their roles have been reversed. Here, it's Jonathan who is static, fatalistic, sentimental, morbidly obsessed with the past and fixated on preservation, whereas Alex is naïve, optimistic, unburdened by the past, fixated on the newest new thing. Jonathan's life is a museum. Alex's life is an unknown frontier. Jonathan wears a suit. Alex wears a track suit. Jonathan leans toward tragedy. Alex insists on the importance of happy endings. Jonathan fictionalizes and sentimentalizes the past. Alex tells a true, living story.

Elijah Wood's night-creature eyes, magnified by the thick lenses of old-man eyeglasses, convey a lot about the cracked intensity of the young man called Jonathan Safran Foer in Everything Is Illuminated . That such a comically somber investigator of his own family's old-country roots carries the same name as the author of the acclaimed novel on which this loving adaptation is based is just one of the book's meta flourishes enthusiastically embraced by first-time feature filmmaker Liev Schreiber.
Actors talk about wanting to stretch, but few would hazard a project with such a high degree of difficulty as Schreiber, who also wrote the screenplay. And under the circumstances, Schreiber's heartfelt project earns points for disciplined ambition. The gloomy tenderness Wood brings to Foer as he searches for his grandfather's vanished birthplace is offset by the maniacal Eastern European practicality of Eugene Hutz's Alex, a truly terrible interpreter. For one of those obstreperously original books that are themselves impossible to translate, Everything Is Illuminated  is impressively well lit.


The precocious literary gymnastics of Jonathan Safran Foer's bestselling novel have been boiled down to more elementary Holocaust-related memorabilia in "Everything Is Illuminated." Liev Schreiber's feature writing and directing debut eschews the book's stylistic daring in favor of a plainly straightforward account of a young New York writer's quest for his family's roots in a vanished Ukrainian shtetl. Subject matter will stimulate sympathetic interest and perhaps some enthusiasm from Jewish and literary-oriented auds, and Elijah Wood's name will provide a draw up to a point, but overall prospects look moderate in specialized release. 
It would have taken a daring filmmaker on the order of Darren Aronofsky or Emir Kustirica on a good day to conceive of anything resembling the cinematic equivalent of Foer's 2001 novel, which boldly skips through more than 200 years of history, features a dauntingly large cast of characters and both strenuously and hilariously flaunts a seemingly unlimited talent for manipulating the English language.
No one seeing Schreiber's film could begin to imagine the breadth and nature of the book, as the estimable thesp has narrowed the focus to the near-present and the curious journey of one Jonathan Safran Foer (Wood) to former Soviet territory to track down the woman who may have saved his grandfather from the Nazis.
Opening scenes have a vaguely eccentric feel, as Jonathan, an ultra-fastidious lad who looks about 17 and is accoutered throughout in a black suit and thick framed glasses that enlarge his blue eyes to an eerie extent, is given a yellowed photo of his youthful grandfather and a woman identified as Augustine. Jonathan has a large wall pinned with ancestral artifacts that identifies him as an anal retentive of the first order.
His opposite number can be found over in Odessa, Russia. Alex (Eugene Hutz, looking not unlike the young John Turturro) sports an ear stud, gold tooth and heavy bling, worships Negroes (as he puts it), hip-hop and break dancing and can imagine moving to America to make lots of money. He also has a gift for gab, which his fractured and distorted locutions in English only enhance.
Alex's aged grandfather (Boris Leskin) has made a career of taking "rich Jewish people" around the country looking for their relatives and ancestral homes. But despite his being fed up with all Jews, alive and dead, as well as his claim to blindness, the old crank agrees to chauffeur Jonathan on his search for the village of Trachimbrod, with Alex going along as translator.
Divided into five titled chapters, pic begins showing its middle-brow colors as the three men hit the road in an antique Trabant; extended travelogue footage plastered with slabs of ethnic music is punctuated by very broad comic relief provided by a pet pooch named Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. (when in doubt, cut to the dog, seems to be the byword).
In general, Schreiber's approach is one of reducing the rich, if sometimes overwrought, material down to its most accessible, audience-pleasing elements. Jonathan's uptight, humorless mien blocks the development of any further character traits; role's rigid conception might have worked had the rest of the picture been similarly stylized, a la Jarmusch or the Coen Brothers. As it is, Wood's powerlessness to break out of the emotive straightjacket hands the picture to his Russian costars on a platter, and they run with it.
The gangly Hutz has fun with Alex's loose, crude attitude and easily tosses off the delightful malapropisms that lace his dialogue. Hitting comic and dramatic notes, Leskin powerfully delivers as the often silent grandfather, whose feigned blindness is a convenient mask and whose ultimate reaction to what they find provides for sobering understated dramatics.
The latter's discovery of a hidden ravine filled with World War II armaments triggers the men's eventual encounter with the tragic past. An old woman (Laryssa Lauret, very good) who knew the man in Jonathan's photograph brings to life, with the visual aid of discreet flashbacks, the awful events that took place there in 1942. As touching as some viewers may find the late-on revelations, their harrowing nature is watered down from the novel, in line with the film's general eagerness to please and not to disturb too much.
Matthew Libatique's alert camerawork seems in search of a unifying stylistic approach that is never defined. Czech countryside fills in nicely for Ukrainian locales.

Utterly unfilmable novels don't scare some peoplea would-be Cronenberg after a fashion, actor-turned- Yiddishe -auteur Liev Schreiber  has fashioned a serviceable, small-boned adaptation of Jonathan Safran Foer 's inherently defiant, voice-mottled debut book, lean and silly and modest. Not only is Foer's language necessarily dropped from the loopapart from the inevitable narration, giving us a molecular taste of the Ukrainian protagonist's chaotic consumer Englishbut so is the mysterious no-man's-land between page and reader, where absurdist ideas are not visualized but can be seen  nonetheless. Schreiber jettisons the novel's juicy mock-folk shtetl legends and focuses on the "very rigid search" of young American neurotic Foer (Elijah Wood ) for the Slavic woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis. Wood's Foer is an anemic straight-man caricature (hardly the precocious nebbish Foer suggested himself to be), and so texture is provided by Eugene Hutz  (of Gogol Bordello ) as Alex, Foer's Odessa  hipster guide, and grizzled Russian vet Boris Leskin , as Alex's irascible, anti-Semitic, guilt-riddled grandfather.
What tale there is left to tell is reduced to driving (through the Czech Republic ) and mildly comic culture clash conversationuntil the three-man convoy reaches the extinct village where Foer's ancestral treasure lies half buried, waiting for rediscovery. Schreiber relies on relentless soundtrack oompah-pah to make the jokes seem like jokesuntil the sniffly climax. (Schreiber, like many actor-directors, is indulgent of"heavy" moments of staring and gesture that actually have no weight at all.) Still, Foer's ironic ideas have a lovely roundness to them, and somehow the film achieves Holocaust-fiction balance without much ado or melodrama. It may be substantially less ambitious than its source material, but that may be what saves it from implosion.
