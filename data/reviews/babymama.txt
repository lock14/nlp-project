One of these days the talents of Tina Fey will become apparent to me and I�ll be able to look back at her time on Saturday Night Live
, her current hit sitcom 30 Rock
, and Baby Mama
 and see the comic genius everyone else apparently already sees. Until then, I�m at a loss: Every time I see her, I can�t help thinking she looks like she�d rather be anywhere but onscreen � unconvinced and uncommitted, as if she never entertained the possibility of being a star and so hadn�t really prepared herself for the responsibility. Which is a problem for a movie like Baby Mama
, in which every scene begins when Fey enters a room and ends when she leaves it. As Kate Holbrook, a successful 37-year-old executive with no social life but a burning desire for a baby, Fey is supposed to be the solid (if insecure) sun around which a whole solar system of eccentrics revolves, including Fey�s former SNL
 cast mate Poehler as Angie, a lower-class brat whom Kate hires to be her surrogate, and Martin as Kate�s blissed-out, ponytailed boss at Round Earth Organic Market, who rewards his employees for their good work with �five minutes of uninterrupted eye contact.� Instead, Fey is perpetually tentative, either unwilling or unable to throw herself into the role of a no-longer-young single woman with a pounding biological clock, a natural neuroticism, and parental paranoia that I�m guessing is supposed to come off as absurd and satirical but is probably par for the course in modern Yuppie America (if there isn�t already a stroller with air bags on the market, it�s only a matter of time before there is). In Fey�s defense, writer/director McCullers doesn�t help her much, shifting the tone of his screenplay between boorish bathroom humor, corny musical montages, and forced emotional confrontations without much concern for logic or consistency. That's a shame because when Angie unexpectedly moves into Kate�s apartment, the opportunity is there for some meaty class-conflict humor: the shallowness of the trendy upwardly mobile versus the stubborn cultural provincialism of the America�s Funniest Home Videos
-loving lower-middle-class, set against a backdrop of impending motherhood. But, just like it is in the world of SNL
 that Fey, Poehler, and McCullers sprang from, the choice gets made time and again to aim not for the high road but for the great, big, fat, juicy, unchallenging, uncontroversial middle ground, where everybody�s laughing but nothing is all that funny.

Fey and Poehler deliver in 'Baby'
I feel bad complaining about the current fertility trend in movies, since if I weren't watching women wrestle with pregnancy, I would barely be able to watch them in comedies at all. The genre has been colonized by men who grant women the ability to deliver a baby but rarely a joke. So on these grounds alone "Baby Mama" is an unexpected triumph. It's a romantic screwball comedy about a yuppie and the woman she pays to carry her baby. The movie was written and directed by a man, Michael McCullers. But it cuts out the obligatory middleman and lets two women make us laugh, often very hard.
Kate Holbrook (Tina Fey) is 37 and occupationally accomplished (she works as a vice president at a comical Whole Foods-ish supermarket chain in Philadelphia). But she's single, childless, and having a terrible time conceiving. She could keep injecting herself with hormones. She could adopt. Instead, she pays an agency $100,000 to find a surrogate. The search turns up Angie Ostrowski (Amy Poehler), a petite and stupendously blond slacker with bad eating habits and a dolt named Carl (Dax Shepard) for a boyfriend.
An hour with Angie and I might have reconsidered the deal, but Kate is intrepid. At the end of their first date, Angie proposes the surrogacy and Kate eagerly, almost sexily accepts, saying, "Angie, I'm gonna put my baby inside you." Only R. Kelly could have put it better. The ensuing trip to the fertility doctor is a montage scored to "Endless Love" that produces the perversely heavenly sight of Poehler swinging her legs into stirrups. The movie drums up an excuse for pregnant Angie to move into Kate's apartment so the personalities can really clash and the culture farce can really get going: the fastidious yuppie versus the low-class dingbat.
The movie has fun outside Kate's spacious Philadelphia apartment. (It looks suspiciously like a nice adult apartment on Manhattan's Riverside Drive.) Romany Malco is Kate's sweetly streetwise doorman. Sigourney Weaver is the hilariously fertile founder of a surrogate-parent organization (her headquarters resemble the oval office). Steve Martin has some amusing scenes as Kate's kooky extra-crunchy boss - those flower-print shirts suggest he's running Trader Joe's on the side. And Greg Kinnear, getting sexier by the role, plays the owner of a smoothie shop who's worried that Kate's new store might be gentrifying the neighborhood. Here we have a slight reversal of the galling finale of "You've Got Mail," where the man puts the woman he likes out of business, but she loves him anyway.
But the movie's hook is the rapport between its two stars. They turn a classical screwball relationship upside down. Fey is Cary Grant in "Bringing Up Baby," stiff, law-abiding, humorously humorless. Poehler is Katharine Hepburn by way of Jerry Lewis. The years they spent working together on "Saturday Night Live," where Poehler still works, have turned them into a sharply instinctive comedy duo. The uproariously uncouth people Poehler often plays are a natural affront to Fey's buttoned-up professionals. They're roiling ids and ridiculously physical. Poehler gradually lets a human being out of Angie long enough for the characters to seem like more than a gag. But she's at her delirious best when out of physical control.
"Baby Mama" is less than a perfect movie - it's shoddily assembled, and McCullers's coincidence-driven script, smart as it sometimes is, rushes us out the door. But in this era of Apatow and Ferrell and Rogen and Wilson, of men monopolizing movie comedy, "Baby Mama" feels absurdly momentous, and even political. Fey and Poehler aren't just taking back control of their bodies. They're taking back control of their profession.


More than any other woman working in comedy today, Tina Fey   has figured out how to charm men while speaking sisterly truth in a frequency heard only by other women. That's an awesome skill, and with it comes awesome power. Forthright yet inclusive, tough yet effortlessly feminine, an alumna of SNL  and the creator of a brilliant hit network sitcom, she has the means to affect our nation's political discourse with a waggle of her trademark brainy-babe eyeglasses and one well-placed declaration. ''Bitch is the new black'' will do for starters.
Baby Mama , a teeteringly uneven comedy, isn't much of a conversation starter, but it does at least bring a politicized raised eyebrow to the sacred realm of pregnancy and motherhood among a certain estrogenically mindful population of entitled thirtysomethings. You'd think this most fertile of laugh territories would be a perfect Fey playground. And it is, at least when the star, as upscale 37-year-old executive Kate Holbrook, is seen in her natural career habitat as a woman holding her own among men. (Kate's company runs a chain of health-food stores  a delicious contradiction in business models. Better yet, Steve Martin   plays the New Age-y capitalist who runs the venture.) But then a longing for motherhood grips singleton Kate, whose inability to conceive leads her to comedy-sister-in-arms Amy Poehler   as Angie Ostrowiski, a downscale surrogate with a womb for rent. And when pregnant Angie moves into her employer's tasteful home, the contrasting foibles of class, socioeconomics, and wardrobe choices are all too broadly sketched by the two femme comrades.
Written by SNL    alum Michael McCullers, who makes his directing debut with gawky visual inexperience, Baby Mama  turns square midway through the pregnancy saga, then heads for a most un-Fey-like, aw-gee tale of happily-ever-after. There is, it turns out, a guy to fit our gal, and he's played by Greg Kinnear; Angie, meanwhile, learns better nutrition and how not to urinate in the sink, and thus broaden her horizons. Poehler is as improv-sketch loose in her performance as Fey is measured, and both are challenged to a thespian throwdown by a fearsomely funny Sigourney Weaver as the smug head of the surrogacy agency. But although the big picture itself gets mushy, the small moments, especially involving Fey, are sharp. Every inch a woman who conveys an ease in her own skin, she has become a madame comedy ambassador of her sex, able to negotiate with the big boys, then relate the experience in a way that has the smart girls hooting with knowing laughter.

 In the new comedy “Baby Mama” Tina Fey plays a 37-year-old single career woman who, desperate for a baby, hires a womb of her own in the dizzy, slap-happy form of Amy Poehler. The film never comes fully to term, as it were: the visual style is sitcom functional, and even the zippiest jokes fall flat because of poor timing. But, much like the prickly, talented Ms. Fey, it pulls you in with a provocative and, at least in current American movies, unusual mix of female intelligence, awkwardness and chilled-to-the-bone mean.  Ms. Fey is of course best known for working in television, on “Saturday Night Live” and “30 Rock.” Until now her biggest movie role was the uncomfortable but earnest high school math teacher Ms. Norbury in the comedy “Mean Girls,” which she also wrote.  (“You all have got to stop calling each other sluts and whores,” Ms. Norbury warns the mean girls and their female prey. “It just makes it O.K. for guys to call you sluts and whores.”) Like a lot of comedies “Mean Girls”  has its devilish cake and eats it too, wagging an unpersuasive finger at the very cruelty it skillfully deploys. Ms. Fey may not want girls to call one another sluts, but she’s all too happy to call them that herself.  There’s often a degree of sadism in this kind of comic one-two punch, and while some performers appear to direct the cruelty inward — think of Jerry Lewis and Ben Stiller wringing squirmy, uneasy laughs out of the humiliations rained down on their characters — that doesn’t seem to be Ms. Fey’s style. Certainly it isn’t what she’s called on to do in “Baby Mama,” in which she plays a snappy, sardonic individualist who, much like Ms. Fey herself, works in a male-dominated industry (here, as an executive in an organic grocery chain similar to Whole Foods) and favors the kind of sexy librarian look (high-heeled shoes, low-cut blouses and dark-frame glasses) that signals there’s a hot body to go along with that feverishly smart brain.  “Baby Mama,” which was written and directed by the newcomer Michael McCullers, yet another “Saturday Night Live” alumnus, opens with Ms. Fey’s character, Kate Holbrook, eyeballing babies like a hungry wolf. Everyone has a pitter-pattering Tater Tot but Kate, who lives alone in her generically appointed Philadelphia apartment (the film was also shot in New York)  and has few contacts outside her job, extended family and wisecracking doorman, Oscar (Romany Malco). Basically she’s Rhoda with thinner thighs, which I guess means that she’s Mary Richards. But this being 2008 and not the women’s-liberated 1970s, it isn’t enough for Kate to be a swinging single: she wants a baby and she wants it now. Enter Angie Ostrowiski (Ms. Poehler).  At 36 Ms. Poehler is at least 10 years too old for the role, as the softly focused close-ups suggest, but she’s a pip. She’s the ball that bounces against Ms. Fey’s formidable wall, a nonstop, joyfully watchable whirligig. Drawn in broad, often crude strokes, Angie is dumber than the usual dumb blonde so beloved of the movies largely because she’s also coded as white trash, a kind of urban Daisy Mae, complete with short shorts, wads of chewing gum and a tag-along buffoon, Carl (Dax Shepard). If Angie works at all, it’s because Ms. Poehler puts a sweet spin on her character’s gaffes, whether she’s yelping in horror at the unfamiliar taste of water or squatting in a sink when nature makes an untimely call.  There’s more, though not much, mostly some amusing nonsense from Steve Martin as Kate’s boss, a belligerently New Agey entrepreneur with an unkind ponytail.  Greg Kinnear also shows up now and again as Kate’s inevitable love interest, perhaps so things don’t overheat when Angie moves in. Not that anyone need worry about this female odd couple, given that Ms. Fey, who doesn’t have the acting chops that might invest her character with some personality, has been forced to play it straight and narrow. The close-up medium of television is more forgiving of those comics who tend to stand in the middle of the frame as if they had just been planted. But unlike Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, Ms. Fey doesn’t even have a funny voice.  That’s too bad, because she is genuinely funny. And if there’s anything the movies could use it is funny women, especially those who earn laughs by keeping their clothes on and their dignity (more or less) intact. Under the old Hollywood system, the studio boss might have ordered up a dance coach for Ms. Fey, maybe a few lessons on how to walk across a set or move her upper body once in a while. She might not have been able to rip loose as a writer-performer, which makes the idea of her developing a simultaneous on-and-off-screen presence all the more tantalizing. Real funny women — Mae West, Elaine May — come along every few decades, so the timing seems right. But the clock is ticking.  “Baby Mama” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Some gentle raunch.

A tailor-made girls' night out movie, "Baby Mama" is a tidily wrapped package the contents of which you can easily guess before opening it. Bigscreen teaming of longtime "Saturday Night Live" cohorts Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, as two women brought together through a dubious surrogate pregnancy, employs both broad gags and mild wit in telling an exceedingly predictable tale designed to push recognition buttons with thirtysomething women, to likely sweetly profitable results.
The role of Kate Holbrook, a bright, accomplished and attractive career woman who feels a sudden need to have a baby, seems so perfectly suited for Fey that it will be widely assumed that she wrote the script herself, as she did for "Mean Girls." In fact, pic reps the handiwork of writer and first-time helmer Michael McCullers, a co-scenarist on the two "Austin Powers" sequels, who worked with Fey, Poehler and producer Lorne Michaels on "Saturday Night Live" some years back.
Along with the pregnancy angle, a source of interlaced anxiety and humor, pic looks for most of its laughs in the "Odd Couple"-ish forced cohabitation of Kate's ultra-confident uber-yuppie and Angie (Poehler), a trailer-trash vulgarian Kate finds to carry her baby upon learning she's got little chance of conceiving on her own. Unfortunately, far too much of this culture clash is expressed through cheap gags such as Angie's preference for junk over health food and her sticking gum underneath Kate's coffee table.
Happily, some of the script's tributary branches prove more fertile than the core. Kate patronizes a top-of-the-line surrogacy center whose owner (Sigourney Weaver) stirs intense envy and wonderment in her clients by continuing to be abundantly reproductive even in her late 50s.
Even better, the owner of Round Earth, the health food grocery chain where Kate is a top executive, is inventively played by Steve Martin as a long-haired new age guru with eccentric business habits and communication techniques (such as placing foreheads together to foster mutual understanding) that are nuttily funny without tipping into the absurd.
Kate's present project is launching a new store in a borderline Philadelphia neighborhood, an occupation that neatly dovetails with the interests of local juice bar owner Rob (Greg Kinnear). While the latter role is by nature dully functional, providing Kate with dating material while her baby is growing in someone else, Kinnear invests the attractive fellow with just enough scruffiness, skepticism and unruly backstory to make him a welcome presence.
Thesps and the generally congenial mood make "Baby Mama" go down easily enough, with the major caveats that the two major plot twists (or perhaps bumps best applies here) are plainly visible from miles away, and that McCullers' eagerness to please results in a story with not a single rough edge or lingering issue. The world on view here has not a speck of dirt or difficulty left in it once the plot entanglements are sorted out.
Fey is a delight to watch throughout. Able to convey Kate's intentions and feelings through the simple looks and inflections, she never melodramatizes her situation; nor does her efficient, perfectionist side become overbearing. A fine foil and partner for her co-star through long experience, Poehler is a bit more scattershot in her effectiveness, due to Angie's sometimes overdrawn coarseness, her misguided motives and her alliance with a bottom-feeder mate (an amusing Dax Shepard). Some additional laughs come courtesey of Romany Malco as a sometimes overly helpful doorman, Holland Taylor as Kate's acerbic mother and Siobhan Fallon Hogan as a birthing class teacher with a wild accent that channels early Marlene Dietrich.
Although shot mostly in New York, pic picks up some added freshness via Philadelphia streets locations. Craft contributions are handsome, although Jeff Richmond's score veers towards on-cue preciousness.

Could have sworn I've seen this episode of Baby Mama  before—like sometime in January 2007, when it was originally titled "The Baby Show" and aired on the other prime-time series starring Tina Fey , 30 Rock  . (Waitaminute—you say Baby Mama's a movie and not a TV show? Seriously? Coulda sworn . . .) It was funny the first time around when Fey, as late-night-TV exec Liz Lemon , suddenly found herself drawn to the sound of cooing and the scent of baby powder. After a poorly placed phone call to the world's worst fertility/meth-addiction doctor ("I should start by saying that I can't personally help you conceive. Something happened to me while scuba diving"), Liz wound up snatching an adorable tyke from a hairdresser—totally by accident, but still, dark, weird stuff.
Baby Mama  extends the joke, then softens it, then smothers it in its crib—an unpleasant picture perhaps, but not any more disagreeable than the phrase "Produced by Lorne Michaels ." Ultimately, that's all this shrugging disappointment is: a Saturday Night Live   sketch stretched a good hour past its breaking point of no return.
Pairing Fey with her former "Weekend Update" co-anchor Amy Poehler , Baby Mama 's little more than Tommy Boy  on estrogen-replacement therapy—one more wa-a-a-a-cky SNL  buddy comedy. Even Fey—who managed to stay sharp as a prison-yard shiv while toiling on Michaels's anesthetizing assembly line—has fallen victim to the boss man's familiar failings as a filmmaker, wherein he plucks the show's famous cast members and asks them only to do more of that. Michaels actually has Fey to thank for his sole solid producing credit: Mean Girls , which Fey wrote and appeared in alongside Poehler, was a knockout, and the exception to the SNL -movie rule—which is why, ultimately, Baby Mama  is more disappointment than disaster. But Fey didn't write this one; first-time director Michael McCullers  did—he of such duds as Thunderbirds  and Undercover Brother , which only felt like a Lorne Michaels production.
Fey's now called Kate Holbrook , and instead of a NBC TV exec, she's a VP at a Whole Foods  knockoff called Round Earth. And instead of working for a slicked-back boss played by Alec Baldwin , she's working for a pony-tailed boss played by Steve Martin  as a puffy hippie-dippy dope who rewards his execs with things like five minutes' worth of uninterrupted eye contact. (Martin, who says things like "I am a great man, and great men do great things," hasn't been so deadpan or dead-on in ages; he steals the show from the sidelines.)
Kate, of course, wants a baby: She visits a sperm bank, consults doctors, and plasters her apartment with Post-It notes bearing such think-positive aphorisms as "Yes! Be Fertile!" before turning to Poehler's surrogate womb. A single woman who frightens off prospective mates with too-much-information monologues over dinner, Kate is more than content to live the "alternative lifestyle"—that is, be a single mom. But as the Coen Brothers  put it in Raising Arizona, her insides are a rocky place where a man's seed can find no purchase—something to do with a T-shaped uterus. She's left with but one choice: a surrogacy firm run by Sigourney Weaver 's regal rip-off artist Chaffee Bicknell , who's in her late fifties but still quite capable of cranking out babies—worth mentioning solely because Weaver's age becomes the source of countless jokes that give the film the stale flavor of a Comedy Central  roast. (When Weaver says she's "expecting," Poehler mutters: "Expecting what—a Social Security check?" It never gets any funnier.)
Kate outsources her pregnancy for $100,000 and winds up with a "dumb white-trash" couple on her doorstep: Angie Ostrowiski  (Poehler) and her husband Carl (Dax Shepard ). Poehler doesn't seem sure what to do with Angie, who occasionally speaks in a hillbilly accent unless it disappears altogether and she's just Amy Poehler killing time till the next commercial break. She never commits to the part of a chain-smoking mercenary trolling for embryos to make rent, perhaps because to do so would create too wide a chasm between upper-class Kate and broke-ass Angie and render the film's main storyline—the development of a friendship by the 40-minute mark—too unbelievable.
Ultimately, the movie exists solely to reunite a winning comic duo: two women so singularly in sync that, during their stint on "Weekend Update," they genuinely laughed at each other's jokes despite their no doubt well-worn familiarity come showtime. Kate and Angie are just Tina and Amy goofing around—drunk-dancing, crooning along to video-game karaoke, and, once more, finishing each other's sentences. I'd rather watch MILF Island .
