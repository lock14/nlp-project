Killing Hitler fails, but Cruise gives it his best shot
It is my duty to report - to the possible chagrin of more than a few readers - that "Valkyrie" is not a disaster. On the contrary: It's a smooth, compelling, almost suspenseful (more on that in a bit), and slightly hollow Hollywood period piece - a World War II action-drama in which an intriguing (but not electrifying) star performance is buttressed by stellar support. Above all, it finally gives Tom Cruise a mission that actually turns out to be impossible.
That knowledge - that the conspiracy headed by German Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg (Cruise) failed to assassinate Adolf Hitler and stage a successful coup d'etat on July 20, 1944 - hangs over "Valkyrie" like an anvil on a thread. Director Bryan Singer, reuniting with his "Usual Suspects" screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie as well as Nathan Alexander, works feverishly to whip up excitement, throwing datelines and tick-tock time titles on the screen as if to glue us to the moment. "11 a.m.," "4:15 p.m.," "6:39 p.m." - after a while I just synchronized my watch and said the hell with it.
The film's historical hook is that not all Germans thought Hitler was a swell fella and that some, in fact, came to consider him a traitor to true German glory. Colonel von Stauffenberg returns from the Third Reich's failed Tunisian campaign minus an eye and an arm but suffused with righteous fury at the Fuhrer's murderous regime. "I serve my country," he says, "but this is not my country."
This line is delivered in a clenched, intense near-whisper that Cruise never relinquishes, except to shout the occasional order late in the going. The lack of any perceptible German accent isn't that bothersome - Cruise well understands that the masses pay for his star wattage rather than to see him transform into something he's not ("Tropic Thunder" notwithstanding) - and, anyway, he's surrounded by British actors barking away in British cadences. Our most inherently fascistic superstar ("Top Gun," anyone?) is testing exactly how far his will can triumph here and he may know the ironies involved better than you think.
Cruise thus holds down the middle, which allows his supporting cast to work the corners in rewarding, even entertaining ways. After the Colonel recuperates from his injuries, he joins a cabal already in progress, headed by politicians (Kevin McNally as would-be Chancellor Carl Goerdeler), ex-generals (Terence Stamp as Ludwig Beck), and lower-ranking officers (Kenneth Branagh among them). The group is riven by infighting, indecision, jangled nerves: Bill Nighy alone sustains the movie as General Friedrich Olbricht, a fussy little bureaucrat who can't quite believe what he's involved in. With just the slightest tilt toward black comedy, "Valkyrie" could have been the "Dilbert" of Nazi movies.
But the weight of history sits heavily on this film's shoulders, and, besides, it's awards season. Thankfully, Singer sticks close to the facts, and he knows he has a rich dramatic gimmick in von Stauffenberg's game-changing notion: To turn the Fuhrer's existing anti-coup plan, code-named "Valkyrie," into a Trojan Horse assault. Under the pretext of saving the Reich, the conspirators aim to destroy it.
This entails acts of subterfuge worthy of "Mission: Impossible" itself, including bamboozling a high-ranking general (Tom Wilkinson, delightfully two-faced) and using an entire, unsuspecting reserve army (headed by Thomas Kretschmann, one of the few actual Germans playing a German) for the plot's own ends.
And, yes, Hitler (David Bamber) needs to be taken out, a task that falls to von Stauffenberg during a meeting at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia. Again, the star creates a heroic model of positive fascist thinking - this train will run on time, dammit - amid a sea of lesser but more colorful figures: Eddie Izzard as a Hitler factotum in on the plot, Christian Berkel as a demolitions expert convinced any problem can be solved with the proper application of high explosives.
"Valkyrie" is at its most convincing - tragic, even - during the climactic scenes that suggest how close these men came to pulling it off. One's heart hurts: nine months of war and millions of deaths were so nearly averted. For a few heady hours, Berlin was in their hands, and then events conspired against the conspirators. In another touch worthy of "The Office," the film's turning point may be the decision by a nameless official in the teletype department over which side's messages to forward. As Germany itself hangs in the balance, we see the terrified cogs turning in this nonentity's head as he wonders which choice might cost him his job.
Hitler survived, of course. So will Cruise, even if his Claus von Stauffenberg is an honorable conception that's ultimately too thin to fully rise up from the pages of history. This story deserves to be told, but for reasons best known to himself, the star has latched onto a strictly Nietzschean interpretation that he rides into the ground. Maybe he thinks what doesn't kill him will win him an Oscar.


Once the fodder for gossip as brassy as a Wagner horn solo, the behind-the-scenes operatics that delayed the release of Valkyrie  are quickly forgotten the minute Tom Cruise  gets down to the business of plotting to kill Adolf Hitler. Cruise plays Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, a Good German famous to his countrymen for his resistance to the Nazi mandate but less known among Americans. Trained as a loyal soldier, the well-bred officer's disgust at his Führer's leadership deepened following severe wounds suffered during battle in Tunisia, where he lost a hand and an eye. And the assassination plan and subsequent government transition that Stauffenberg devised, with help from a network of dissident army officers and political leaders, was an audacious blend of suspenseful daring and wonkish political strategy.
History confirms, of course, that the July 20, 1944, operation failed when a bomb planted in Hitler's presence did too little damage; the Nazi leader survived with minor scratches, army loyalists quelled the coup, and Stauffenberg suffered the consequences, along with scores of others. But Valkyrie , as field-commanded by director Bryan Singer , succeeds on its own terms as a handsome hybrid of conspiracy thriller and history lesson, of Mission: Impossible  and The Day of the Jackal . The movie (with an uncluttered screenplay by Singer's old pal, Usual Suspects  scripter Christopher McQuarrie, along with Nathan Alexander) is less interested in why these men, Stauffenberg in particular, decided to take such risks than in staging how they might have looked when they met in tight, secretive groups to plot and smoke cigarettes.
But they do look good , devising a new world order in rooms often lit with a touch of amber and outdoor scenes almost always shaded in the metallic palette of guns and steel. The mechanics of the actual plot are pretty amazing. Singer has assembled a top-notch international cast  with Tom Wilkinson , Bill Nighy , Kenneth Branagh , Terence Stamp , and Eddie Izzard  among the British invasion  and given them leave to speak their lines with the accents they brought from home. And in the middle, standing straight as a Top Gun  ace, is Tom Cruise, that quintessentially self-constructed American movie star, speaking in quintessential American tones as he declares, ''We have to kill Hitler.'' Cue the trumpets.

 There are no discernibly nasty Nazis in “Valkyrie,” though Hitler and Goebbels skulk about in a few scenes, shooting dark, ominous looks at the heroic German Army officer played by Tom Cruise. Perhaps they’re wondering what this Hollywood megastar is doing in their midst, a sentiment that you may come to share while watching Mr. Cruise  —  who gives a fine, typically energetic performance in a film that requires nothing more of him than a profile and vigor  —  strut about as one of history’s more enigmatic players.  That enigma was Claus von Stauffenberg, a count and a colonel   who, though he lost one eye, an entire hand and several fingers while fighting on behalf of the Reich, made several attempts to assassinate Hitler and seize control of the government. At the core of  Stauffenberg’s spectacularly ambitious plot was Valkyrie,  Hitler’s plan  for the mobilization of the home army that  Stauffenberg hoped to hijack in order to quash the SS and its leaders.  It didn’t work, of course, for  complicated reasons, though also because by 1944, as William L. Shirer bluntly puts it in “The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich,” the conspirators were “terribly late.”  You don’t learn how belated the  coup d’état was in “Valkyrie,” which might matter if  this  big-ticket production with Mr. Cruise in an eye patch and shiny, shiny boots had something to do with reality. But the director, Bryan Singer (of the “X-Men” franchise), and the writers, Christopher McQuarrie and Nathan Alexander, aren’t interested in delivering a history lesson: that’s why Ken Burns was born. Slick, facile entertainment is the name of the game here, as it is in all Mr. Singer’s films, including “Apt Pupil” (about a Nazi war criminal and the American boy next door who outs him) and “The Usual Suspects,” an  intricately plotted story with men and guns, secrets and shadows that Mr. McQuarrie wrote. The secrets have already begun swirling by the time “Valkyrie” opens with Stauffenberg, stationed in North Africa, bitterly recording his opposition to Hitler in a diary right before losing various body parts to the war. After his convalescence he meets Maj. Gen.  Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh), who, sometime earlier, tries to blow up Hitler with a bomb hidden in bottles of French liqueur. (Russian vodka might have been more effective.) Stauffenberg soon joins the conspiratorial party that includes other British class acts brandishing high military rank and speaking in lightly accented or unaccented English: Bill Nighy as Gen.  Friedrich Olbricht, Tom Wilkinson as Gen. Friedrich Fromm, Terence Stamp as Gen.  Ludwig Beck and Eddie Izzard as Gen. Erich Fellgiebel.  Most of the crucial rebellious officers are played by British actors, while some of the Nazi diehards are played by Germans, which wouldn’t be worth mentioning if this cacophony of accents weren’t so distracting. But, as with the casting of Mr. Cruise, whose German voice-over quickly eases into English, this international acting community invokes an earlier studio age, when Peter Lorre and Claude Rains delivered their lines in exotically flavored English and everyone pretended that Rick’s Cafe really was located in Casablanca and not on a back lot. If Mr. Cruise doesn’t work in “Valkyrie,” it’s partly because he’s too modern, too American and way too Tom Cruise to make sense in the role, but also because what passes for movie realism keeps changing, sometimes faster than even a star can change his brand.  Though Mr. Singer’s old-fashioned movie habits, his attention to the gloss, gleam and glamour of the image, can be agreeably pleasurable, he tends to gild every lily. Hitler (David Bamber) doesn’t need spooky music or low camera angles to be villainous: he just has to show up. Mr. Singer’s fondness for exaggeration can even undercut his strongest scenes, as when Stauffenberg visits Hitler to secure approval for the rewritten Valkyrie plan. If implemented, the plan will bring down the Führer who, for his part, seems intent on bringing down the house with leers and popping eyeballs. Mr. Singer appears to have taken cues here from “Black Book,” Paul Verhoeven’s World War II romp, but he’s too serious to make such vaudeville work.  Stauffenberg, who hated Hitler but worshipped the Reich, sacrificed himself on the dual altar of nationalism and militarism, which makes him a more ambiguous figure than the one drawn in “Valkyrie.” He’s a complex character, too complex for this film, which like many stories of this type, transforms World War II into a boy’s adventure with dashing heroes, miles of black leather and crane shots of German troops in lockstep formation that would make Leni Riefenstahl flutter. It’s a war that offers moral absolutes (Nazis are evil) and narratives (Nazis are evil and should die) that seem easier to grasp than any current conflict. Truly, World War II has become the moviemaker’s gift that keeps on giving, whether you want it to or not.  “Valkyrie” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Bombs, guns and executions, though little blood.

After a long takeoff, "Valkyrie" finally takes flight as a thriller in its second half but never soars very high. Bryan Singer's long-awaited account of the near-miss assassination of Adolf Hitler by a ring of rebel German army officers on July 20, 1944, has visual splendor galore, but is a cold work lacking in the requisite tension and suspense. This second production from Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner at United Artists will do better than the first, "Lions for Lambs," but is a decidedly odd choice for Christmas Day release, and looks destined for just so-so commercial returns.
Cruise himself is a bit stiff but still adequate as Col. Claus von Stauffenberg, the handsome, aristocratic officer whose disenchantment with Nazism, the Fuehrer and the war finds sympathetic ears among a sizable number of military bigwigs at a time when the tide has turned against Germany in the East and an Allied invasion is expected imminently in the West.
Well-carpentered script by Christopher McQuarrie, reuniting with Singer for the first time since their joint career breakthrough on "The Usual Suspects," and Nathan Alexander must inevitably wrestle with the "Day of the Jackal" issue of the known failure of the central plot. Allowing for the need to compress and streamline events, the scribes have hewed pretty closely to the facts but haven't injected sufficient sizzle into the dialogue or individuality into the characters.
As if the filmmakers felt the need to placate modern viewers who might wonder why they should emotionally indulge Nazi authority figures, the opening is swathed in Stauffenberg's feelings about how Hitler and the SS are a "stain" on the German army and his coincidentally contemporary desire for a "change" in the country's leadership. Shortly after entering these sentiments into his diary while serving in Tunisia in 1943, Stauffenberg is badly injured and loses his right arm, the last two fingers of his left hand and his left eye; with a black eyepatch, he still looks quite dashing, even if executing a Nazi salute with a prosthetic arm might appear rather irreverent.
Slowly letting his insurrectionist sympathies show, Stauffenberg is introduced to a circle of powerful men, many of them old-school army officers whose conservative notions are closer to those of the Kaiser of their youth than to the rabid ideology of Hitler and the SS. Script unfortunately erases many of the interesting personal and political nuances pertaining to these men, notably the urgent belief of some that, with Hitler gone, they could join with the United States and Britain to beat back the Soviet Union and prevent the Bolshevization of Germany.
What is perhaps most amazing about the plot is that so many people were involved and yet it was never detected with any certainty. Among the central figures: Major-Gen. Henning von Tresckow (Kenneth Branagh), first seen trying to kill Hitler by sneaking a bomb onto the Fuehrer's plane; retired Gen. Ludwig Beck (Terence Stamp), a longtime Hitler opponent at the center of the military-civilian conspiracy; Gen. Friedrich Olbricht (Bill Nighy), another veteran resistance figure still in a position of authority; Gen. Erich Fellgiebel (Eddie Izzard), whose role in charge of communications at Hitler's Wolf's Lair compound in East Prussia would be crucial to the plot's chances; and the most equivocal figure, Gen. Friedrich Fromm (Tom Wilkinson), commander in chief of the reserve army in Berlin, and a cagey operator who artfully turns a blind eye to the conspirators' activities while remaining cautiously loyal to the Reich.
As it finally takes shape, the plan hinges not just on eliminating the Fuehrer but on implementing a coup in Berlin. To this end, Stauffenberg has the brilliant idea of turning Operation Valkyrie, the code name for a measure enabling the reserve army to take control of Berlin in a national emergency, to their own purposes. Stauffenberg, thanks to his access, will place a bomb in a briefcase underneath the large conference table during a briefing at Wolf's Lair, while his associates in the capital will implement the government takeover as Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin.
An ambitious plan, to be certain, one in which details large and small go wrong. Putting it on the screen in a clean, classically derived style, Singer is careful to make sure everything is clear to the viewer and emphasizes the sometimes daunting physical reality of things, such as the difficulty Stauffenberg, with only three fingers, has in cutting the thick metal wire necessary to set the bomb's fuse.
Once Stauffenberg has set off the explosion and cleverly slips away, convinced Hitler couldn't possibly have survived, the picture's grip strengthens somewhat as the coup, initially delayed, ultimately stumbles forward. Due to interrupted lines, no one in Berlin knows if Hitler is alive or dead, and the film's single haunting scene shows a room full of female communications operators slowly raising their hands, one by one, to indicate to their supervisor that they have received some news -- the Fuehrer is dead.
It isn't long before evidence to the contrary comes through. The reserve army, which has rounded up the SS and gone to arrest Goebbels (whose name Cruise for some reason makes rhyme with "nobles"), is told to stand down, and the tables are turned on the conspirators after a few heady hours. And Germany has nine months of devastation to look forward to.
Story's fascination, ironies, missed opportunities, implications and what-if aspects invest "Valkyrie" with automatic appeal for anyone interested in history in general and World War II in particular. But a nagging feeling persists throughout that the film should be more gripping than it is, and that the men involved could have been revealed with more complexity and dimension.
Cruise makes Stauffenberg a stalwart, flawed and honorable man, but reveals little sense of his stellar intellectual, artistic and family background. The star's neutral Yank accent contrasts with the British voices that surround him but, truth be told, it is more the Anglo intonations coming out of the German characters that sound oddly disconcerting.
Of the character actors, Wilkinson most impresses with his robust presentation of an intriguingly Janus-like figure. David Bamber carries off a pretty plausible portrait of the declining Hitler in a handful of scenes. Although it would have looked like inappropriate stunt casting in this context, the suspicion nonetheless persists that the contemporary English-speaking actor who would make the most interesting screen Hitler is former Singer cohort Kevin Spacey.
Pic's standout elements are the locations and the superb production design by Lilly Kilvert and Patrick Lumb, which convey a palpable sense of legendary historical sites such as the War Ministry, Wolf's Lair, Hitler's Berghof residence and the Benderblock (the executions of Stauffenberg and others were lensed at the actual spot). A couple Junkers three-engine planes of the sort used by Hitler are impressively employed, and attention to detail is felt down the line. Newton Thomas Sigel's lensing has a restrained elegance, and John Ottman once again doubles adroitly as editor and composer.
The conspiracy has inspired at least four previous pictures: two German productions of the mid-1950s, the 1990 American telefilm "The Plot to Kill Hitler," which starred the late Brad Davis as Stauffenberg, and the widely praised 2004 German TV production "Stauffenberg," with Sebastian Koch in the title role.

Claus Philipp Maria Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg—a lot of name for a lot of guy. Born into aristocracy in 1907, he was a soldier by the age of 19—and, by most accounts, a warrior with the soul of a poet (he was especially smitten with the work of Stefan George , a family friend), who'd briefly considered becoming an architect before deciding, "Right, duty first." Hence his quick ascension through the ranks, as befitting a soldier born in a castle.
Depending upon which account you get, Stauffenberg was either against the Nazis from the get-go or merely a distant detractor at first; in his book The History of the German Resistance, 1933–1945 , historian Peter Hoffmann  (who receives a prominent thanks in Valkyrie 's end credits) suggests that perhaps the country-firster even "welcomed and supported the Nazi regime," as he never spoke openly of his contempt for Hitler's National Socialists. But history offers myriad interpretations: Several stories have Stauffenberg, himself never a member of the party, plotting to kill Hitler as early as 1942, after he'd witnessed the mass murders committed by the Nazis during the invasion of the Soviet Union ; others suggest he wasn't on his way to becoming a committed co-conspirator until April 1943, when, during a stint in Africa, his regiment was attacked by British bombers, whose machine guns robbed the good soldier of his left eye, his right hand, and two fingers on his left.
That attack is where Valkyrie  director Bryan Singer  and writer Christopher McQuarrie —the tandem previously responsible for The Usual Suspects —begin their telling of Stauffenberg's attempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler  in the summer of 1944. (Nathan Alexander  is also credited as a writer.) The lieutenant-colonel, played by Tom Cruise , argues with a superior about how all's lost out here in the sand and insists that it's time to retreat. A moment later, his higher-up is dead; so, too, are most of Stauffenberg's men. And so he is reborn a sworn enemy of the Führer.
But what truly fueled Stauffenberg's desire to kill Hitler—his breeding, that bleeding, or just his fear of the approaching Allies, who were already in France—is a question for which Valkyrie  has little interest. This is no more of a character study than Cruise's Mission: Impossible  franchise was a three-part examination into the soul and psyche of Ethan Hunt . It pops up corn and serves it in a crystal bowl; this is cineplex hooey, a footnote in history rendered shiny and wide-screen in order to prove that Cruise, studio chief and actor, is in control and that Singer can do more than men-in-tights movies.
The intentions are noble: to make a hero out of the forgotten man who tried to seize control of Germany in order to broker a truce with the Allies. But Valkyrie  doesn't spend much time memorializing Stauffenberg; this isn't really Oscar fare, even though its based-on-a-true-story baggage, period clothing, location setting, and reputable A-list cast suggest as much. What to do with a movie that is impossible to spoil (you do know the ending, right?) and winds up with the hero being assassinated by a coward? (Didn't work out very well for that Jesse James  movie last year, either—I mean, the ending was right there in the title.)
Well, the supporting performances are uniformly top-notch by all actors wearing uniforms—especially Bill Nighy  as General Friedrich Olbricht, the true ringleader of the plot, but also its Achilles' heel at crucial moments. Nighy and Tom Wilkinson , as the equally craven but also crueler General Friedrich Fromm , bring gravitas to Valkyrie —kind of like Philip Seymour Hoffman  in M:I III , who seemed to have filmed his scenes with one hand in the ATM. Nighy and Wilkinson are playing opposite ends of Valkyrie 's spectrum: Where Olbricht is brazen about his attempts to use Germany's reserve army to seize Berlin  from the SS (Operation Valkyrie, ahem ), Fromm pretends he doesn't know what's going on, as though silent compliance would somehow spare him from a Führer who'd take his own life months later. Kenneth Branagh  and Eddie Izzard , as compatriots in the conspiracy, are more or less the Ving Rhames  and Simon Pegg  of Valkyrie , which is to say "perfectly fine" and "absolutely inconsequential."
As for Cruise, his Stauffenberg has prompted, twice now, guessing games with friends and colleagues as to who would have been better in the role. Viggo Mortensen 's name keeps popping up for the sole reason that he's never bigger than his parts (and his range extends further than from A to A.) But Cruise is all we see here—Ethan Hunt in an eye patch, pretending he's missing some fingers. (All he's really missing is the form-fitting mask.) Even when saying goodbye to his wife and kids for a final time, Stauffenberg never seems like a man for whom there's anything at stake—maybe missed dinner reservations. Valkyrie  feels like another installment in the never-ending franchise—not just the action-movie one, but the Tom Cruise one. Like the operation itself, it's a good idea—just not well-executed.
