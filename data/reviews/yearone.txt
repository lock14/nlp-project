When the movie summer of 2009 is writ in the annals, Hank Azaria may turn out to have been its secret star. Certainly he deserves a plaque for most saves. He alone made “Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian’’ bearable as the prissy evil pharaoh, and his handful of scenes as the biblical patriarch Abraham  - promising mass circumcisions followed by wine and sponge cake for everyone  - offer the only laughs in the endless plain of unfunny that is “Year One.’’
Unfortunately for us, the stars of the movie are Jack Black and Michael Cera, playing two cavemen, Zed and Oh, who wander off the grid into various early civilizations. Cera’s dreamy geekboy sex appeal is still working for him  - barely  - but Black is way past his expiration date. The actor’s unvarying comic shtick  - blubbery egotism and over-enunciated dude catchphrases  - has never seemed feebler.
The movie mulches recent movies like “Apocalypto’’ and “10,000 B.C.’’ with a big serving of “Monty Python’s Life of Brian,’’ minus the brains. Zed and Oh are failures as either hunters or gatherers, and anyway, Zed has eaten from the Tree of Knowledge (not that you can tell), so he and Oh are exiled to the mountains and beyond. First stop is Bible-land, where they witness Cain (David Cross, annoying) slaying Abel (Paul Rudd, here and gone) and stop Abraham from sacrificing Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse, the raging nerd from “Superbad’’).
Then we’re off to a suspiciously Roman-looking Sodom, with a bad king (Xander Berkeley), a hot-to-trot princess (Olivia Wilde), a poofter bear of a high priest (Oliver Platt under pounds of makeup), and the heroes’ tribemates taken as slaves, including true loves Maya (June Diana Raphael) and Eema (Juno Temple). A promising orgy scene with Cera spray-painted gold gets diverted into endless giggly-pansy jokes involving Oh, the priest, and hot oil.
There’s also the scene where Zed eats a turd, and the bit in which Oh, hanging upside down in a dungeon, urinates on his own face. Are you laughing yet? The problems with “Year One’’ are easy to identify: the script, the direction, the editing, the performances. Under the hand of director Harold Ramis (whose “Groundhog Day’’ is looking more and more like a fluke), scenes stumble to a halt unfinished and the actors are forced to vamp in the void. Some, like Azaria, are up to the challenge, and every so often the movie gets off a decent sight gag, like an ox-cart chase scene that whips along at 7 miles per hour.
Any good will the movie generates, though, is grated right back off by Black, whose obnoxiousness has lost whatever charm it once possessed. “Year One’’ matches him stride for puerile stride, playing like a lesser Bob Hope-Bing Crosby “Road’’ movie rewritten by a team of potty-obsessed 12-year-old boys. What it says about our own civilization is too depressing to think about.

Every era gets the prehistoric comedy it deserves. In the '60s, when the desire to find our way back to our primitive, shaggy-haired selves was all the rage, there was a vogue for caveman slapstick  The Flintstones , the comic strip B.C. , and, of course, the Raquel Welch loincloth oglefest One Million Years B.C.  (not a comedy, at least not intentionally, but who's counting intentions?). In our current all-snark-all-the-time meta-culture, where there are twice as many late-night talk-show hosts devising new ways not to take anything seriously as there are network news anchors, we have Year One , starring Jack Black as Zed, a facetious, jabbering, mock-fierce hunter, and Michael Cera as Oh, a facetious, monosyllabic, mock-ineffectual gatherer. The two are bedecked in loincloths, pelts, and unkempt Neanderthal hair, but under the barbaric ensembles they're meant to be ludicrously contemporary, outrageously civilized  misfits stuck in a tribe of head-conking brutes. They're such outcasts that within the film's opening 20 minutes, they get booted out of the tribe. They then trek to the mountains that are supposed to mark the end of the world and land in the middle of...the story of Cain and Abel.
You heard right. Year One , directed by the veteran card Harold Ramis (Caddyshack , Groundhog Day ), from a script he co-wrote with Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, sets us up to expect a caveman comedy, but the film turns into a blockbuster game of bait and switch. It takes these two lugs, who barely seem like lugs, and sets them down in a series of half-cocked Bible stories, where they unleash their frazzled, too-much-bad- cable-TV derision on a bunch of long- bearded scowlers who speak in ''Art thou?'' Scripture-ese. The movie could be Bill & Ted's Old Testament Adventure , or maybe Hope and Crosby–meets–Jimmy Kimmel on The Road to Sodom , with the second half set entirely inside that walled-up sin city. Year One  has a handful of chuckles, but it's also harmless and scattershot, without much primitive bite. These targets were savaged far more cuttingly 30 years ago, in Monty Python's Life of Brian . Then again, that was satire. This is just silliness run mildly wild.
One reason that I'm always up for a Jack Black comedy is that he never, ever loses his enjoyment of idiot cool. Each time he gleams lustfully, or offers one of his I must be on drugs if you just said that  discombobulated rejoinders, it's as if for the first time (though let's be honest, it's probably the 501st time). In Year One , Black rides a horse-drawn cart as if it were a roller coaster, and he also threads his way through smiting, fratricide, and the invention of circumcision with his incredulous stoner logic. When a girl is about to be sacrificed to God, Black will not miss a beat before saying ''Seems like a waste of  a perfectly good virgin to me!'' And the thing is, he means  it. Michael Cera tries to coax his more passive style into a 'tude as tricky as Black's, only Cera's presence doesn't pop. He's attempting to be an ironic wimp, but he seems not just wimpy but neutered. He comes off as a contradiction  a flatly sincere, almost academic cutup.
Fortunately, there are terrific supporting jesters in Year One . Hank Azaria turns the imperious Abraham into a very grand wack-job; David Cross makes the murderous Cain a figure of hilariously matter-of-fact ego; and Oliver Platt, freeing himself from his usual mopiness, is a marvel as Sodom's high priest, a lisping libertine dandy who, having made Cera's Oh his slave of the moment, forces the poor young man to baste him in body oil. Platt, more than anyone, is the soul of the movie, because he makes even the most  primitive perversity sound...well, civilized. B–

 “Comedy,” Jerry Lewis or some other professional wisenheimer once said, “is a man in trouble.” In Harold Ramis’s “Year One,” a thoroughly, sometimes gaggingly broad and sly conceptual laugh-in laced-with-jokes  — about God, poop, circumcision, female underarm hair and the state of Israel —  comedy is two men dressed in animal skins and neck deep in shtick. Set in what looks like a succession of B-movie studio sets, the film brings to mind a Hope and Crosby road movie, though only if Bob and Bing, after studying the Bible as children and reading Nietzsche as adults, were grappling with issues of faith.  Filling Hope and Crosby’s clown shoes nicely in “Year One” are Jack Black and Michael Cera as  Paleolithic tribesmen. Zed (Mr. Black) is an inept hunter with a wayward spear while Oh (Mr. Cera) is a gentle gatherer who murmurs sweet nothings to his berries. After Zed is banished by the tribe for his blunders, the two hit a surrealistic road that takes them from the forest to the desert with stops along the prehistory and history continuum. Before they depart, however, Zed bites into a golden apple he plucks from the forbidden tree of knowledge, a defiant act that awakens his mind. “Everything is weird,” he declares with philosophical purity. Not long after he is down on his hands and knees sampling human scat.  Everything is indeed weird in Mr. Ramis’s highbrow slapstick, in which theological questions are smuggled in between silly bits about excrement and body hair. Much as Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner did with the 2,000 Year Old Man, Mr. Ramis, who wrote the screenplay with Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg, is playing with history, or rather with the serious stories familiar from religious instruction and Hollywood epics. “Is it true that you were at the scene of the Crucifixion some 2,000 years ago?” Mr. Reiner asks the 2,000 Year Old Man. “Oh, boy! I knew Christ,” Mr. Brooks replies. “Thin lad. Always wore sandals. Hung around with 12 other guys. They came in the store, no one ever bought anything. Once they asked for water.”  In “Year One” Zed and Oh keep up a similarly nonsensical running conversation during their travels, which take them first to a meadow where they meet two pastoral types, one of whom has a really bad attitude. That would be Cain (David Cross), who’s soon brutally whaling on his brother, Abel (Paul Rudd). (“You want some of that?”) Er, spoiler alert! Cain kills Abel, beating him to death with a rock. Mr. Ramis stages the murder with so many (off-screen) blows that the scene rapidly morphs from funny to queasily humorous to just plain unpleasant before rebounding to the uneasily comic. Mr. Ramis likes to push humor to its tasteless edge, but the violence here feels almost personal, as if he were wielding that rock.  In some ways that’s precisely what he’s doing in “Year One,” which, as Zed and Oh amble through different historical periods and Bible stories, takes knowing and often profane swats at the sacred. Cain proves to be a real pest (a nice observation on the persistence of evil), and things go from bad to worse. Zed and Oh are sold into slavery and marched across the desert by Romans with British accents. They escape, only to inadvertently persuade Abraham (Hank Azaria wearing a long glued-on beard) not to slay Isaac (Christopher  Mintz-Plasse). Jokes about snipped foreskins and the Holy Land’s borders ensue, as does a trip to Sodom, leading to an assortment of predictable, if unprintable, puns and yuks.  In his 1981 satire “The History of the World, Part I,” Mr. Brooks revisits the past, starting with the dawn of hirsute man and ending with the French Revolution, tossing in some religious broadsides along the way. Mr. Ramis, by contrast, fashions a seamless narrative from Zed and Oh’s adventures, jettisoning the usual time frames associated with these foundation stories to create something of an ahistorical collage. In this film Stone Age man walks alongside Roman centurions and heroes and villains from the Old Testament, which suggests that when Mr. Ramis hasn’t been listening to old comedy routines he’s been boning up on the debate about evolution versus creationism. Riffing on the movie’s title: in the beginning there were multiple beginnings, each good for lots of laughs.  For the most part those laughs are generous, tasteless, groaningly goofy and irresistible, though I wish the filmmakers had resisted the temptation to sacrifice, for an unnecessary gag, a Sodomite priest (Oliver Platt) who had taken a liking to Oh. By that point the film has run out of steam, having mined various B-movie clichés (the kind in which prehistoric women wear eyeliner) and even taken a time out for a discourse on God. I would like to think that the final scene, which finds Mr. Ramis playing Noah and sending Zed and Oh off with female mates, was a lazy afterthought, simply an admission of how the past was written. Here’s hoping that in “Year Two” the Stone Age finally gives way to Stonewall.  “Year One” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Violent sacrifices and excremental snacks.

An amiable stroll through biblical times featuring Jack Black and Michael Cera as exiled Neanderthals, "Year One" lacks seismic guffaws but elicits many mild smiles. Borrowing the understated run-on gag structure from co-writers Gene Stupnitsky and Lee Eisenberg ("The Office," for which director Harold Ramis has helmed a few episodes), and adding several players from producer Judd Apatow's stable, this low-tech opus offers an ironic commentary on the utter idiocy of religious superstition and received knowledge, all the funnier for being delivered by world-class idiot Black. Still, the PG-13-rated, CG-free comedy may prove too tame to score big with target auds."Year One" opens on a slapstick wild-boar chase in a primordial environment with few employment possibilities other than professional hunter or professional gatherer.
Accident-prone hunter Zed (Black), having eaten the forbidden fruit of the tree of knowledge, is kicked out of his village. Reluctantly accompanied by nerdy gatherer Oh (Cera), Zed crosses over mountains (and several millennia) to arrive in time to witness Cain (David Cross) slay Abel (Paul Rudd, in a hilarious cameo) not once but several times, each new assault more "accidental" than the last.
After enjoying a brief sleepover at Adam's (Ramis) and thwarting the human sacrifice of Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) by dad Abraham (Hank Azaria), the Neanderthal pair wind up in Sodom for the last half of the picture, trailing half the cast with them.
Naming himself "the Chosen," Black's Zed keeps tearing down belief systems -- that the world ends over the next hill, that virgin sacrifices bring drought-relieving rain -- only to replace them with elaborately rationalized, purely ego-driven elevations of himself as the world's savior, until reality (or else the more sarcastic Oh) hauls him back from his delusions of grandeur.
Fittingly for a movie that denies religious causality, the jokes themselves seldom have defined beginnings, middles or ends. Some gags have no payoff whatsoever (Oh, fatally wrapped in a huge yellow python, shows up unscathed in the next scene without explanation).
Black's partner-friendly stylings, as evidenced in his couplings with Hector Jimenez in "Nacho Libre" and Mos Def in "Be Kind Rewind," pay off beautifully here: He and Cera bounce off each other brilliantly, Black's braggadocio neatly complementing Cera's sadsack understatement. But other casting choices in this overpopulated spoof seem like so much excess baggage. Apatow discovery Mintz-Plasse ("Superbad") fails to rekindle his McLovin' magic as a tagalong Isaac. June Raphael, as brunette bombshell Maya, doesn't spark even negative magnetism -- unlike Juno Temple's ditzy Eema, who ultimately divests Oh of his teen-virgin status.
Ramis has been ridiculing the sanctimony of pious religious epics at least as far back as his legendary mid-'70s SCTV lampoon of "Ben-Hur." Here, the helmer entertainingly skirts sacrilege with skits skewering a Sodomite high priest (a bejeweled Oliver Platt) and a colorful spin on Old Testament happenings including the reading of entrails ("To me, I see a happy face").
Despite its irreverence, the pic seems unlikely to pique interest by courting religious opposition. Unlike Kevin Smith's "Dogma," "Year One" so muddles its orthodoxy and telescopes its timeline as to make any protest seem more absurd than the film.
