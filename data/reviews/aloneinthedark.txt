         As silly as it is stylish, "Alone in the Dark" has a preposterous premise, but since the film is based on the Atari video game of the same name, it also has much to appeal to headbangers: fast pace, lots of gadgets, monsters, explosive special effects, plenty of inscrutable plot twists and turns. Beyond that, director Uwe Boll, cinematographer Mathias Neumann and production designer Tink have created a striking-looking world for their film — one that's shadowy, brooding and menacing. On a purely visual level, "Alone in the Dark" is persuasive.
 
  The gist of the film's elaborate premise seems to be this: Some 10,000 years ago the Abkani, a highly advanced group of Native Americans, believed the world was divided into the realms of dark and light, and they discovered the portal to the darkness. They were able to close it but not before some evil spirits escaped, which was enough to cause the Abkani to vanish from the face of the earth.
 


         






    In 1967 anthropologist/mad scientist Professor Hudgens (Mathew Walker) discovers that portal in an abandoned mine, which happens to be in the countryside outside Vancouver, Canada. He is somehow able to capture those evil spirits, which assume the form of tiny dragon monsters, and subsequently implant them in the spines of 20 children in a nearby orphanage in a deranged experiment to create a mutant species. They become "sleepers" who can be awakened once the evil spirits are set loose.
 
  Hudgens has just located a gold Abkani trunk in a shipwreck packed with not only evil spirits but also a plug needed to open the portal. As it so happens the one "sleeper" who got away, whose inner dragon was apparently electrocuted in some manner when he was still a child, has grown up to be Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), paranormal investigator for a secret bureau run by agent Richard Burke (Stephen Dorff).
 
  On assignment in the Amazon, Carnby happens upon the set of three Abkani rings that surround the plug Hudgens has located; once the plug is inserted into the rings, it's open sesame for the portal. It also happens that Carnby's girlfriend, Aline (Tara Reid), is an assistant to Professor Hudgens and is helping him prepare an exhibit of Abkani art.
 
  The plot is set in motion by the opening of the Abkani trunk, which causes the "sleepers" to disappear. Much violence, much sci-fi/paranormal mumbo jumbo follows. Slater dominates the film with ease, and Dorff is appropriately blunt and fearless, but Reid is stiff and bland. The film's clutch of writers has come up with lots of apparently unintentionally laughable dialogue, and Reid's flat, deadpan delivery is just perfect for uttering "Alone in the Dark's" most self-evident line: "Some doors are meant to stay shut."   

ad movies are a dime a dozen, but every so often, an out-and-out stinker like "Alone in the Dark" slinks into the marketplace. This horror film, spun off from an old Atari video game, is so inept on every level, you wonder why the distributor didn't release it straight to video, or better, toss it directly into the trash. It arrives with an impenetrable back story that is scrolled across the screen while a solemn narrator reads the portentous text that establishes a mood of instant confusion. The chaos that unfolds has something to do with the Abskani, an ancient culture that has been revived under the fiendish direction of a mad scientist (Mathew Walker) who operates out of an abandoned gold mine. In the rear of his laboratory is a locked portal to the underworld. It's enough to say that Christian Slater is Edward Carnby, a paranormal investigator who grew up in the same orphanage (directly on top of the gold mine) from which 19 children mysteriously disappeared two decades earlier. Edward is accompanied by his ex-girlfriend Aline (Tara Reid), an  anthropologist specializing in Abskani artifacts, and the hotheaded leader (Stephen Dorff) of a paranormal SWAT team. Large hunks of the movie are taken up with machine-gun fire programmed to crunching heavy metal and directed at bounding spidery monsters intent on taking over the world. "Alone in the Dark" looks as though it had been thrown into a shredder and randomly reassembled. For reputable actors like Mr. Slater and Mr. Dorff, it is an embarrassment that smacks of career desperation, but at least they hold their own. About Ms. Reid's clumsy cue-card readings, the less said the better. In the language of metacritic.com, a Web site that  translates critical assessments into numerical grades,  I give "Alone in the Dark" a zero. This movie is rated R. It has considerable violence and some gore.

Very loosely based on a classic computer-game trilogy that revolutionized horror-adventure gaming in the 1990s, "Alone in the Dark" offers ample evidence that "House of the Dead" helmer Uwe Boll should put down his joystick -- quickly, before anyone else gets hurt. Derivative bloodbath jettisons the games' atmospheric suspense and Lovecraftian sense of the macabre in favor of slasher movie mayhem, wit-free dialogue and endlessly protracted and gory shootouts. Fans of the source material probably won't be switching platforms to catch this bizarre Lions Gate pickup, and non-fans definitely won't.
One of the few elements salvaged from the original series is the central character, independent paranormal investigator Edward Carnby (Christian Slater), who, as revealed in flashback, was one of 20 orphans subjected to gruesome medical experimentation. Twenty-two years later, Carnby is a troubled, chronically paranoid man who, when he's not trying to solve occult crimes, spends his time searching the globe for dangerous artifacts.
Carnby returns home with his latest acquisition and is immediately attacked by a madman in sunglasses who has to be shot, impaled and hurled through multiple glass windows before he finally succumbs.
Soon, all 19 of Carnby's former fellow orphans are reported missing, and there's a deadly monster attack on the museum where Carnby's girlfriend, brainy anthropologist Aline Cedrac (Tara Reid), works. She's convinced the creatures -- as well as the mysterious golden relic Carnby has just brought back from Chile -- are somehow linked to the Abkani, a sophisticated but now-extinct Indian tribe that long ago opened the gate to some unidentified evil force.
Also figuring into the increasingly nonsensical plot are a friendly coroner (Frank C. Turner), the ambitious Professor Hudgens (Matthew Walker) and an official squad of paranormal agents known as Bureau 713, where Carnby used to work before turning renegade. The bureau is represented by macho jerk Cmdr. Burke (Stephen Dorff) and staffed by lots of desk-bound ciphers who blurt things like "Electromagnetics off the scale, sir! I've never seen anything like it!" Alas, most auds have
, and far too often.
With production values as inconsistent as its tone, pic reps a schizoid hybrid of action genres, morphing from supernatural chiller to zombie thriller to "Indiana Jones"-style escapade in roughly that order. Early scenes rip off the slow-motion fight choreography of "The Matrix," while some of the later sequences are so choppy they could have been influenced by direct-to-video release "Starship Troopers 2: Heroes of the Federation."
As for the monsters, which have the power to distort electricity (conveniently causing the lights to flicker ominously every time one approaches), they're impressively grotesque and hydra-like, even if they do look like rejected conceptual sketches from the "Alien" series.
Slater holds down his end of the frame admirably, embodying a flat character with stripped-down action-hero panache. Not so his female co-star Reid, who faces the monumental task of playing a superintelligent hottie, and who unfortunately adds unintentional humor as she scribbles notes on a clipboard, wearing a pair of owlish specs.
If there's one way pic improves on vidgame, it's in the high-resolution graphics: These have to be some of the youngest, buffest, most gorgeously tanned scientists on record. In all other respects, "Alone in the Dark" offers no surprises and zero replay value.

From Piranha II through The Abyss  to Titanic , James Cameron  has demonstrated his affinity for the life aquatic. Hollywood 's King of the World adds depth, literally, to his immersion with a new 47-minute 3-D IMAX  nature doc, Aliens of the Deep.  Lurid title notwithstanding, this underwater explorationorganized by Cameron and some two and a half years in the makingis a Disney  co-pro that deploys canned scientific explanations and a cast of perky marine biologists to establish the requisite sense of theme park awe.
Cameron himself plays the Director, who, no laid-back Steve Zissou , orchestrates a fleet of four submersibles at something like two miles below the surface. "Here's the deal," he barks, breaking the surface of humanoid blandness. And it is a deal: De Niro-voiced sharks, CGI pilot fish, and even the sissified little SpongeBob  have nothing on the bizarre, apparently nameless creatures that Cameron and his crew discoverstarting with a fabulously 3-D-friendly cellophane scarf that swims past the submersible porthole. Perhaps the most amazing sight in this often thrilling almost-feelie, which takes as its paradoxical subject the condition of life without light, is the incredible swarm of blind albino shrimps clustered around the smoking "chimneys" formed by volcanic eruptions from beneath the ocean floor. They're not exactly cute, although Disney will be battling Pixar  for rights to the miraculously iridescent, big-eyed, Bambi-eared octopus-ish whatsit that glows prettily for the camera and vanishes back into the deep.
