In Keeping Up With the Steins , Jeremy  Piven, so scaldingly funny as a cutthroat Los Angeles talent agent on Entourage , stretches himself to play...a cutthroat Los Angeles talent agent. The difference  is that here he isn't witty or authentic or much of anything else. The script doesn't give him one good line; he's just a beleaguered sitcom wuss trying to plan a bar mitzvah for his son that will outdo the one thrown by his neighbors. When people put forth the theory that movies now suck and television rules, they might be talking about movies like Keeping Up With the Steins , a comedy that makes you long for the high-voltage freedom of HBO. The film takes all the flavor out of a yummy satirical idea: status envy among assimilated Jews.
With ethnic gags that are about as fresh as three-day-old bagels, Keeping Up With the Steins  may revel in some sagging stereotypes, but make no mistake: It's very much a product of the era of Sarah Silverman, Heeb  magazine, and Curb Your Enthusiasm   comedy with a self-abasing Jewish tilt that, in its ''insider'' outsiderness, offers itself as the new mainstream. The movie opens with a bar mitzvah that's spectacular in its posh vulgarity. On a cruise ship, a boy stands on a mock-up of the Titanic and shouts ''I am the king of the Torah!'' as a hip-hop entertainer raps, ''Hava nagila beer, wine, tequila!'' (Yes, you read that right.) At this point, the movie is at least attempting to be funny, but then Garry Marshall, in a scraggly ponytail and a hippie version of a prayer shawl, shows up as Piven's  estranged father. Marshall takes over the movie (no mystery: his son, Scott, directed it), and Keeping Up With the Steins  turns into a recipe to forget: chopped liver with ''heart.''

 The rollicking bar mitzvah comedy "Keeping Up With the Steins" should cinch Jeremy Piven's status as the go-to guy for scuffling, type-A wheeler-dealers in hip-hop-era Hollywood. (Goodbye, Kevin Spacey.) His character, Adam Fiedler, an insanely competitive talent agent, is virtually identical to Ari Gold, the rat-eyed attack dog he portrays with such bloodthirsty bonhomie on the HBO series "Entourage."  Mr. Piven's beasts, for all their ferocity, are warmblooded creatures cherished by their masters for their devotion and tenacity. Once they latch on to your trouser leg, they will never let go. Depending on who you are, they'll either kill you or kill for you.  "Keeping Up With the Steins" begins as a growling, razor-toothed satire of carnivorous consumption in Hollywood. But after the first half-hour, those growls subside into whimpers, and the movie becomes a family comedy oozing good vibes, generational reconciliation and (far-fetched as it may seem) a spirit of humility.  Humility is nowhere to be found, however, in the opening bar mitzvah sequence. This half-million-dollar "Titanic"-theme bash given by Adam's former business partner and archrival, Arnie Stein (Larry Miller), and his new wife Raylene, (Sandra Taylor) — whom Arnie salvaged from a wet T-shirt contest — gets Adam's competitive juices boiling.  The party, honoring the passage into manhood of Arnie's 13-year-old son, Zachary (Carter Jenkins), involves a miniature Titanic plastered with the salutation "Mazel Tov, Zachary!" Moments later the boy makes a grand entrance proclaiming, "I'm King of the Torah." As a thumping rap version of "Hava Nagila," performed by the guest star DJ Quik, announces, "Hava nagila, beer and tequila," the camera lingers on the tables of piggy children stuffing ice cream into their pudgy mugs.  Adam vows then and there to give his son, Benjamin (Daryl Sabara), an even splashier bar mitzvah. When Benjamin, a timid butterball of a boy still several inches short of five feet, is pressed to come up with a theme, he hurriedly replies, "Baseball." Adam immediately begins making plans to rent Dodger Stadium, serve pizzas shaped like baseball mitts (catered by Wolfgang Puck) and leave each guest a personal Dodger uniform. Neil Diamond himself must sing "Hava Nagila."  Satire is probably the wrong word to describe this hilarious first half-hour. In certain obscenely wealthy circles, this is how it really is.  "Keeping Up With the Steins," directed by Scott Marshall from a screenplay by Mark Zakarin, spends the rest of its brisk 84 minutes amiably retreating into niceness. Behind the camera as well as on the screen, the film, Mr. Marshall's directorial debut, is a family affair. The role of Adam's father, Irwin, a superannuated hippie who abandoned the family when Adam was a boy, is played by Mr. Marshall's father, the director Garry Marshall ("Pretty Woman").  As the guest list is being compiled, Benjamin, secretly and against his father's wishes, invites Irwin, whom he has never met. His grandfather shows up two weeks ahead of time in a camper, accompanied by his much younger girlfriend, Sandy Frost (Daryl Hannah), a k a Sacred Feather, an enthusiastic vegan who works on a Navajo reservation. The scenes in which this preposterous couple frolic naked in the Fiedlers' pool provide the movie's final laugh-out-loud moments before the whole thing turns to mush.  As in countless Hollywood movies where embattled families discover the true meaning of Christmas, Benjamin, with a lot of help from his benign granddad, learns the true meaning of bar mitzvahs. Mr. Piven's lovability quotient is essential to making this turnabout pay off. But as hard as he pushes it, Mr. Piven can get only so far in making the inevitable reconciliation between Adam and Irwin even faintly believable.  Irwin may be saintly now, but the fact remains that he walked out on his family 26 years earlier, and his feeble explanations don't wash. It's the kind of transgression not easily (if ever) forgiven. The movie's method of solving problems is to rush forward and gloss over the chasms of credibility. "Keeping Up With the Steins" would have been a much better film if it had waited twice as long before retracting its fangs.  "Keeping Up With the Steins" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language, flashes of nudity and sexual innuendo.

A sure-fire audience-pleaser, Scott (son of Garry) Marshall's winning comedy bow could have been titled "My Big Fat Jewish Bar Mitzvah." Mark Zakarin's script deftly mocks Hollywood excess while upholding religious tradition, and the cast, from Daryl Sabara ("Spy Kids") to Daryl Hannah, all appear to be having a ball. Pic, skedded to open May 12th in selected cities, will initially attract Jewish auds, but strong ethnic flavor only enhances the pic's universal family-friendly warmth. Not for those who like their humor edgy and their life-lessons subtle, the pic's eclectic comedy ultimately trumps the inevitable schmaltz. 
The titular Steins' shindig is an elaborate "Titanic"-themed bar mitzvah, complete with icebergs, mermaids and a Kate Winslet lookalike. It's been masterminded by Hollywood agent Arnie Stein (Larry Miller). Not to be outdone, his ex-partner and rival agent Adam Fiedler (Jeremy Piven, in a role that predates his "Entourage" gig), plans an even more stupendous do, appropriating Dodger Stadium for a baseball-themed bash, oblivious to the stage fright of bar mitzvah boy Benjamin (Sabara).
The dynamic of the film changes with the arrival of Benjamin's estranged grandfather Irwin (played with scene-stealing Yiddisher gusto by the helmer's pater, Garry), as a gray-ponytailed free spirit. He's fresh from a Navajo reservation and accompanied by flaky g.f. Sacred Feather (a mellow Daryl Hannah). Most of the family welcomes him back into the fold, including Rose (Doris Roberts), his understanding ex-wife, abandoned a quarter-century before. Son Adam, however, roils with decades-old resentment at his father's neglect.
Irwin ropes a rabbi (Richard Benjamin), who's more concerned with marketing his book than shepherding the flock, into explaining the significance of the Hebrew passage Benjamin must chant. Despite a voice that cracks in all directions, the terrified Benjamin, borrowing bracing advice from Irwin and the recently bar mitzvahed Stein boy, impressively segues into manhood.
The transgenerational gags are not all funny and more than slightly corny, but they're delivered with such panache and good-natured sweetness, they shamelessly seduce.
One gets the sense helmer Marshall, a minority goy in the Hollywood Borscht Belt community, bends over backward to soften any mordant bite Zakarin's quasi-autobiographical script once might have possessed. Pic, at times, comes off like a warm, fuzzy, polymorphous party of comedians, where Richard Benjamin rubs elbows with Cheryl Hines and everybody pats the head of the youngest offspring of the Marshall sitcom dynasty to take up the directorial reins of wholesome bigscreen entertainment.
