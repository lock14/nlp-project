         "Swimming Upstream" is a welcome throwback to the rich Australian cinema of the late '70s and '80s that was suffused with the sense of an entire people discovering itself on the screen. There was a tremendous freshness, energy and lack of self-consciousness in such films as "Newsfront," "The Winter of Our Dreams" and "High Tide" — to name the first three that come to mind. At the same time, "Swimming Upstream" is a stunning instance of a work in which it is easy to perceive the universal in the particular.
 
  Adapted by Anthony Fingleton for the screen from his autobiographical novel written with his sister Diane and directed with vigor by Russell Mulcahy, the film opens in Brisbane in the 1950s.
 


         






    Geoffrey Rush's Harold Fingleton is a tough, rangy dockworker with four sons and a daughter and a resilient, understanding wife, Dora (Judy Davis). Home is a modest but pleasant cottage.
 
  Harold favors his rugged eldest son, Harold Jr. (David Hoflin), who incessantly bullies the next eldest son, Tony (Jesse Spencer), who feels he can never connect with his father. Tony is different from the other Fingletons: He plays the piano and takes music lessons and loves to read, much to his father and older brother's derision. But Tony is close to his younger brother John (Tim Draxl) and receives encouragement from his mother. Luckily for Tony and John, there's a municipal swimming pool nearby that provides escape from their father's mood swings.
 
  The pool sometimes attracts the youngest Fingleton brother and the little sister, but Tony and John have become passionate about swimming.
 
  The day their father takes notice changes the lives of the Fingletons forever. Harold rightly sees in his teenage middle sons a pair of champs-in-the-making and coaches them strictly. But as time passes, Harold's terrible childhood as the son of a prostitute, his failure to make it onto Australia's football team and the brutal strikes on the docks all take their toll, and Harold becomes an increasingly violent alcoholic.
 
  Tony Fingleton's odyssey leads him to become Australia's top swimmer, but his story will be familiar to countless sons of alcoholic fathers. Harold has always scorned Tony for being unlike his other children and is jealous of Tony's athletic prowess in a way he is not of John's. Tony is learning the ancient truth for children of alcoholics: That which doesn't kill you makes you stronger. But it doesn't stop a son's craving for love and approval from a parent.
 
  But there's a larger truth Tony also learns: At some point a child's drive to succeed, to escape his or her environment, can outgrow the need to please a parent and be replaced by personal goals.
 
  "Swimming Upstream" is too compassionate and unpretentious — and too wise — to underline the obvious: Tony is simply smarter than his siblings — and his mother, who is also quite intelligent, encourages him accordingly but without calling attention to it. Tony Fingleton is not the first son of an alcoholic to realize wryly that he owes something to his father for providing the adversity, as scarring as it can be, that prods him to succeed.
 
  Ever since his Oscar-winning portrayal of pianist David Helfgott in 1996's "Shine," Geoffrey Rush has portrayed people as singular as the Marquis de Sade and Peter Sellers. So it is something of a surprise to find him playing a blue-collar Aussie bloke and realizing how physically right he is for the part. He captures the torment and anguish of Harold Fingleton and his unrelenting bullheadedness. What a pleasure it is to see Rush teamed with the equally formidable and protean Judy Davis, whose Dora clearly loves her husband but is strong enough to refuse to be a doormat. Yet she also despairs over his disintegration.
 
  Spencer and Draxl are clean-cut types as the brothers whose deep bond is put to the test by their fierce competition in sport. "Swimming Upstream" evokes time and place without being showy about it and offers an altogether invigorating experience.

One of those inspirational true stories about a youth who overcomes daunting obstacles to become a sports hero, "Swimming Upstream" is distinguished by some unusually fine performances, but the lack of a satisfactory third act diminishes overall result. Pic is getting one week of public screenings (sans press previews) in three cities in Oz to qualify for inclusion in the Australian Film Institute Awards, where it has nabbed five nominations, including Best Actor and Actress for Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis. Given virtually no publicity, it's unlikely audiences will patronize this half-hearted exposure, but a more extended theatrical release is promised in the New Year.

Given virtually no publicity, it's unlikely audiences will patronize this half-hearted exposure, but a more extended theatrical release is promised in the New Year.

Screenwriter/exec producer Anthony Fingleton ("Drop Dead Fred," "Blast From the Past") is tapping into his own story here; based on the book he wrote in collaboration with his younger sister, Diane, it's the autobiographical tale of how the siblings lived as youngsters in Brisbane in the '50s and '60s, when Tony became a swimming champ who could have been a contender in the backstroke at the 1964 Olympic Games. Much of the film revolves around the lad's terrible relationship with his father, a bitter, violent alcoholic, superbly played by Geoffrey Rush.
Aided immensely by top-notch production design (Roger Ford) and costume design (Angus Strathie), pic evocatively recreates the somnolent, humid city of Brisbane some 50 years ago. Harold Fingleton (Rush) is a longshoreman who survived an appalling childhood (his mother was a prostitute); he's married to the stalwart Dora (Judy Davis) and has fathered five children, four boys and a girl.
Long periods of unemployment in an era of unrest on the waterfront, plus his unhappy past, have driven Harold to drink. He spends hours at the pub, but there's often not enough food for the family to eat, and he's sometimes abusive to his wife.
Oldest son Harold Jr. (played by Kain O'Keefe as a boy and by David Hoflin as a teenager) takes after his dad; not too bright and a bully, he's clearly going nowhere in life. However, Tony (Mitchell Dellevergin, Jesse Spencer) and John (Thomas Davidson, Tim Draxl) are good swimmers; together with their siblings, they have regularly sought to escape their domestic tension at the local pool, and the hours in the water have paid off. Harold, for barely explained reasons, has always preferred John to Tony, whom he sees as a weakling and a "poof," mainly because the boy is musical. He encourages John in his swimming, hardly paying attention to Tony, who has the real talent.
By the late '50s, the Fingleton boys are competing in contests all over Australia. It's a great time for champion swimmers in Australia, with the young Murray Rose (Remi Broadway) and Dawn Fraser (Melissa Thomas) also competing; in a nice touch, the real Rose and Fraser make cameo appearances, with Fraser playing the swimming coach to her own character. But, despite Tony's obvious prowess in the pool, Harold continues to support John, causing endless friction and pain for Tony.
Newcomers Spencer and Draxl register strongly as the brothers who love and admire one another and yet are forced into conflict by the irrational behavior of their father; both young actors could have big futures on the strength of their work here. The commanding thesping of Rush as the basically tragic father who spends much of his time in an alcoholic haze, and of Davis as the tragic wife desperately trying to keep her disintegrating family together, ensure that the lengthy domestic scenes are emotionally powerful. Director Russell Mulcahy, returning to feature filmmaking in his native Oz for the first time since "Razorback" (1984), doesn't flinch from the pain of these sometimes violent confrontations, and he stages dynamic swimming scenes using a split-screen.
In the end, however, the film becomes repetitive and, given that Tony eventually opts for a scholarship at Harvard rather than a stab at the Olympics, the drama tends to peter out in the final reel. An earlier wrap-up would have been more dramatically satisfying. The odd inaccuracy also grates (the age of consent at the time was 21, not 18 as suggested here.)
Production values are uniformly tops, with particularly slick work from the Animal Logic digital visual effects team.

From Piranha II through The Abyss  to Titanic , James Cameron  has demonstrated his affinity for the life aquatic. Hollywood 's King of the World adds depth, literally, to his immersion with a new 47-minute 3-D IMAX  nature doc, Aliens of the Deep.  Lurid title notwithstanding, this underwater explorationorganized by Cameron and some two and a half years in the makingis a Disney  co-pro that deploys canned scientific explanations and a cast of perky marine biologists to establish the requisite sense of theme park awe.
Cameron himself plays the Director, who, no laid-back Steve Zissou , orchestrates a fleet of four submersibles at something like two miles below the surface. "Here's the deal," he barks, breaking the surface of humanoid blandness. And it is a deal: De Niro-voiced sharks, CGI pilot fish, and even the sissified little SpongeBob  have nothing on the bizarre, apparently nameless creatures that Cameron and his crew discoverstarting with a fabulously 3-D-friendly cellophane scarf that swims past the submersible porthole. Perhaps the most amazing sight in this often thrilling almost-feelie, which takes as its paradoxical subject the condition of life without light, is the incredible swarm of blind albino shrimps clustered around the smoking "chimneys" formed by volcanic eruptions from beneath the ocean floor. They're not exactly cute, although Disney will be battling Pixar  for rights to the miraculously iridescent, big-eyed, Bambi-eared octopus-ish whatsit that glows prettily for the camera and vanishes back into the deep.
