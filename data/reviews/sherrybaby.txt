         You'd have to do the math to know for sure, but casual analysis suggests that stories about drug addicts, especially recovering ones, make up a disproportionate number of stories told on the screen. American movies are fixated on the twin forces of degradation and redemption. Whether that's due to actual audience interest in the subject matter, or to the ease with which stories about addicts fit into the prescribed dramatic structure is hard to say. Or maybe it's not that hard. The trouble with movies about addicts is that, pathos notwithstanding, the addicts themselves tend to be boring and predictable, not to mention especially vulnerable to cheap psychoanalysis.
 
 Despite some affecting performances (Brad William Henke, who plays Maggie Gyllenhaal's brother, Bobby, is wonderful), Laurie Collyer's "Sherrybaby" travels down a familiar road and doesn't add much to the trip. It also arrives on the heels of Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck's sublime "Half Nelson" and doesn't fare well in comparison. Where "Half Nelson" focused on one addict's life, "Sherrybaby" focuses on a less finely drawn addict's path, with very different results.
 


         






   Gyllenhaal plays Sherry Swanson, a now clean and sober heroin addict from a middle-class background, recently released from prison. During her absence, her young daughter, Alexis (Ryan Simpkins) has been raised by Bobby and his wife, Lynnette (Bridget Barkan), who has for all intents and purposes become Alexis' mother, even putting off having children of her own. Naturally, Lynnette is conflicted about Sherry's return, and worried about the effect it will have on Alexis. Sherry, meanwhile, immediately sets to smothering the child in a way that's both cloying and vaguely menacing, and Bobby soon finds himself torn between his wife's wariness and his sister's voracious need for love and attention.
 
 The problem with Sherry is that, unlike Ryan Gosling's Dan in "Half Nelson," whose humanity transcends his addiction and who is still capable, no matter how uneasily, to maintain relationships with others, she is a terminally uninteresting narcissist with a bad case of arrested development. On top of it, Collyer saddles her with the mother of all daddy issues, presumably to make more palatable the fact that Sherry's only way of relating to men is by taking off her clothes within minutes of meeting them.
 
 Once in the halfway house, it takes her about five minutes to get busy with the director of the program, a long-haired 12-stepper named Andy (Rio Hackford), in the basement. She gets rid of him later by glomming onto Dean (Danny Trejo), a "real, live Injun" who recognizes her from her days as an underage stripper and comes conveniently to her rescue. Her dealings with her parole officer, played by Giancarlo Esposito, are unrelentingly brutal, and her interview with the director of a jobs program is worse. At a certain point, compassion fatigue sets in — especially considering how comfortable Sherry seems to be in the role of the dirty girl, and how indiscriminately she courts attention.
 
 "Sherrybaby" is well-crafted and includes some nice moments — there's an unexpected scene in which Lynnette, a makeup saleswoman, reaches out to Sherry by offering to do her makeup. But overall, there's something nihilistic about having to watch Sherry regress to her not-so-happy childhood the moment she gets home, and something alienating about the way in which her compulsions completely overshadow her personality. Who is this woman? Without her slutty clothes, her cigarettes and her junkie's jones for drugs, sex and a toy baby to love her, she's more or less a cipher. It would be frustrating enough if the main character in this month's other druggie movie weren't so finely drawn and individual — but that seems to be the fate of actresses in movies these days; there's not much to them beyond their sexuality. Ultimately, almost as if by accident, the movie ends up belonging to Bobby and Lynnette, two simple, sensitive people doing their best to deal with their twisted family.

In Sherrybaby , the emotionally arresting new independent feature written and directed by Laurie Collyer, Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a young New Jersey woman who's a recently released convict, a recovering junkie, and  more than that  a totally annoying dim-bulb narcissist. Yet from the opening of the movie, she has you hanging on her every word and gesture. Blond and beaming, she speaks in a slack, dazed little-girl voice  the sound of a burnout looking for the next sensation  that makes her sullen sexuality seem an eruption from within. Sherry believes in her willowy body and not much else. She's a cherry-bomb hellion who never grew up; she wants and wants, and gives too little in return. Yet Maggie Gyllenhaal is such a miracle of an actress that she makes you respond to the innocence of Sherry's desperate, selfish destruction. I was gripped by the way that she holds a cigarette, her two fingers stretched out in a girl's rigid notion of ''maturity,'' and by the way her head dips slightly, with sulky sensuality, like something out of an old Cyndi Lauper video. You may not like the character  you'd be deluded if you did  yet your heart opens up and bleeds for her.
Out of prison (her drug habit had turned her into a thief), Sherry moves into a Christian halfway house, where she's tough enough to swat away a combative fellow resident yet not smart enough to keep from dropping her miniskirt for the guy who runs the recovery program. As soon as we see these two in the basement, going at it, we realize what Sherry is up against: not just a history of drugs or a punitive probation system but her own sleazy, myopic, live-for-the-moment nature. Sherrybaby  builds our sympathies around a fantastic ambivalence. Sherry has a daughter, Alexis (Ryan Simpkins), who has been raised by Sherry's brother and his wife (Brad William Henke and Bridget Barkan), and when she goes over to their house and gives the girl a tearful hug, telling her that ''Mommy'' is back, you can't help but want these two to be together. Yet you also know it would be a disaster. Sherry can barely take care of herself, let alone a child. She hasn't earned  this girl. The film is all about how she struggles to.
Collyer, who has worked in documentaries, brings us so close to Sherry that we're sympathetic and aghast, often at the same moment. Gyllenhaal has a great scene in which Sherry embarrasses her family by singing the Bangles' ''Eternal Flame'' at a dinner party, yet what makes it powerful is that we can see that she's been doing this ever since she was a girl, when it was probably charming. Gyllenhaal never lets you forget the damaged child, the baby , under Sherry's jaded facade. The movie ultimately shows you how she got that way, but it never lets her off the hook. Danny Trejo, as the hulking dude who befriends Sherry at a recovery meeting, has a marvelous been-around-the-block tenderness, yet even he can't ''save'' her. No one but Sherry can, and watching her try, fail, and try again makes for one of the most authentic, and moving, journeys the movies have offered this year.

 At first glance, and frequently thereafter, “Sherrybaby” appears to fit comfortably into a familiar class of movies. The film, written and directed by Laurie Collyer, was shown at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, and emerged from the affiliated Sundance Lab, where the downbeat and the redemptive are mixed together according to a scientifically precise formula and shot on digital video.  The grim realism of the opening scenes — the inside of a bus, a battered city street, cigarette smoke, rain — and the mopey, acoustic-guitar-driven music foreshadow the story to follow. Sherry Swanson (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has just been released from prison after three years. A former heroin addict, she must now grapple with the demons of addiction while trying to reconnect with her young daughter, Alexis (Ryan Simpkins), now living with Sherry’s brother, Bobby (Brad William Henke) and his wife, Lynette (Bridget Barkan).  In the midst of these large struggles, she needs to tend to the mundane necessities of finding a job, dealing with her parole officer (Giancarlo Esposito) and fighting the daily temptation to slip back into drug use.  What screenwriters call the arc of the story is visible from the outset, and some of the scenes in “Sherrybaby” have a familiar look and feel. But what distinguishes the film from its many peers is the quality of Ms. Collyer’s writing — which rarely reaches for obvious, melodramatic beats — and the precision of Ms. Gyllenhaal’s performance. She  treats the character neither as a case study nor as an opportunity to show off her range, but rather as a completely ordinary and therefore arrestingly complicated person.  In those first scenes Sherry’s face is a captivating puzzle. Listening to music on her earphones, clutching the paper bag of her belongings, she lets a smile play across her mouth, a sign that incarceration has not erased her capacity for pleasure. Ms. Gyllenhaal’s long legs suggest a self-confidence that is subverted by the stoop of her shoulders, a tall girl’s defense against unwanted attention.  And sometimes Sherry demands attention, easily seducing the manager of the halfway house where she lives just after her release and coolly using her sexuality to secure the job assignment she wants (working in a day care center). But sometimes she looks as if she wants to curl up into a ball and disappear, and the war between these impulses is at the heart of her drama, which in the end involves her attempt to construct a workable identity for herself.    Part of this is the desire to be a mother, a longing that drives some of the film’s most delicate and emotionally risky scenes. Sherry, whose relationship with her father (Sam Bottoms) has a creepy intimacy, has a hard time behaving like an adult around Alexis; it’s almost as if, when she’s with the little girl, she wants to turn into her, or to escape into a shared, private world of innocent play. This puts her at odds with Lynette, who she thinks, with some justice, is in competition with her for Alexis’s affection.  As Sherry, a middle-class suburban woman as well as an ex-convict, tries to figure out who she is, she finds some support from Dean (Danny Trejo), a fellow ex-convict and recovering addict who is both a link to Sherry’s past life and an example of successful liberation from it. Their relationship is tender, ambiguous  and treated  —  by both actors and Ms. Collyer —  with tact and understatement, which are the principal virtues of the movie and, somewhat paradoxically, the source of its cumulative intensity of feeling.

Maggie Gyllenhaal plays a young ex-con trying to reclaim the child who's nearly forgotten her in "Sherrybaby," first narrative feature from writer-director Laurie Collyer (terrif 2000 docu "Nuyorican Dream"). This unadorned, largely downbeat tale is the kind of starkly realistic, small-scale drama that's always a difficult theatrical sell. But a combination of fest acclaim, good reviews and marketing emphasis on the star's exposed-nerve performance may be enough to draw discerning viewers in limited arthouse release.
Sherry Swanson (Gyllenhaal) is just out after three years in stir on a drug-related robbery conviction; she's sober, carries a Bible, and is determined to straighten up and fly right. But the way she carries and dresses herself -- does she own anything beyond short-shorts and halter tops? -- suggests a personality that, for all its hard edges, has in many ways failed to mature past age 16, when she started using heroin.
Before being sentenced at 22, she gave birth to a child, whose father ran off, leaving Sherry's brother Bobby (Brad William Henke) and sister-in-law Lynette (Bridget Barkan) to raise the sprig. Now Sherry wants to assume her place as little Alexis' (Ryan Simpkins) newly returned, reliable mother.
Their first reunion goes more smoothly than one would expect, with Lexi excited and affectionate. But subsequent visits -- and their infrequency -- grow problematic. Lynette clearly considers herself the child's de facto mother at this point, seeing Sherry as a disruptive influence. Sherry lacks diplomacy; she's impatient and frustrated by the fact that people around her continue to hope for the best and expect the worst, rather than trusting her.
That they're right in doing so provides the story with its low-key climactic epiphany.
Sherry enjoys sex, but is also willing to use it to get what she wants, as when she services an employment official to get a job working with children. There's a disturbing revelation as to where that behavior came from in Sherry's too-physical interactions with her and Bobby's seemingly harmless Dad (Sam Bottoms).
Yet a good job, NA meetings and the measured compassion of 12-step veteran Dean (Danny Trejo, playing a good guy for a change) aren't enough to prevent her from caving in when things don't go her way.
Stopping short of the tragic -- indeed even allowing a small, realistic sense of hope at the close, "Sherrybaby" is nonetheless often cringe-inducing as its heroine haplessly stumbles into one self-defeating trap after another.
Gyllenhaal, in her most substantial role since "Secretary," does a fine, unshowy job of limning Sherry's faults without alienating the viewer or pleading for sympathy. Cast is strong, from the protag's wary, thoroughly suburban relatives to Trejo's credibly been-there, done-that ex-gangbanger. Gyllenhaal's scenes with Simpkins are so naturalistic (though the child thesp does occasionally glance at the camera) they must've been semi-improvised.
Unhurried yet tightly penned and paced effort sports solid, unobtrusive tech and design contribs.

Fresh out of the joint with a heroin habit at bay, bottle-blonde Sherry Swanson  (Maggie Gyllenhaal ) swoops down on the young daughter she left behind, who's being cared for by Sherry's brother and his wife. In her hapless efforts to become a reformed mother, Sherry all but swallows the little girl whole and tries to bend an unbending world her way with a poisonous mix of seduction and brutish hostility, leavened with the requisite hint of Good Person beneath. Glistening with Sundance Lab  grit and seriousness (rain-soaked streets, dreary strip malls, etc.), Sherrybaby  is by no means a terrible film. Capably written and directed by Laurie Collyer , whose documentary background is clearly in evidence, the movie is enhanced by intelligent acting from Gyllenhaal, who takes to blue-collar like a duck to water; Brad William Henke  as her sensible brother; and Danny Trejo  as a sympathetic fellow former addict. But we know exactly where the transparent action is going from word one, and the movie never shakes free of a 12-step psychology that carries its subject doggedly from good intentions through relapse, more relapse, to the big secret that explains why this confused young woman is as she is, and to the inevitable glimmer of hope. Sherry may represent a generation bereft of its moorings, but as an individual she's no more than the sum of her pathologies.
