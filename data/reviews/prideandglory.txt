It's a good thing this movie has been sitting on the shelf for a year or more, because, apart from the difference in release dates, there's little to distinguish this new cop drama from last year's cop drama We Own the Night
 � or last decade's Cop Land
 or dozens of other police procedurals that pit brothers against one another in a struggle between clean and dirty law-enforcement tactics, all played out under the watchful eye of a father figure who's also the top dog in the department's chain of command. In Pride and Glory
, we have two brothers, plus a brother-in-law and a dad who's the chief of the detective bureau in which the three work. Norton and Emmerich are the brothers, Raymond and Francis; Farrell the brother-in-law, Jimmy, and Voight the chief of detectives, Francis Senior. Four cops are killed during the film's opening sequence, a situation that sets the whole department on edge and adds a passionate urgency to everyone's desire to find the perpetrator. Dad commands Raymond to lead the task force, and of course the investigation starts to point in the direction of his family members. What's a good brother to do? With a screenplay (co-written by the director's brother Gregory and hyperbolic Narc
 director Joe Carnahan) as predictable as this one, Pride and Glory
's only chance for individuality lies in the manner of its telling. Visually, the film is crisp and detailed (it's shot by cinematographer Declan Quinn), yet the performances, though solid, are less than extraordinary. A film starring such mercurial actors as Norton, Farrell, and Voight raises expectations of fireworks onscreen, which makes their absence all the more noticeable. Also, director O'Connor has set his own bar for working with actors, earning Janet McTeer an Oscar nomination for her performance in Tumbleweeds
 and many kudos for Kurt Russell in his turn as the Olympic hockey coach in Miracle
. Pride and Glory
, however, lacks the right stuff to pierce the thin blue line.


The funeral finally arrives 45 minutes into "Pride and Glory," but the movie's been preparing for it from the opening credits: Everything in this good-cop/bad-cop action drama is shrouded in gray and attended by wailing. This isn't a feel-good genre, granted, but does it have to feel this bad?
When "Pride and Glory" opens, four cops are dead, apparently shot in a Bronx drug raid gone wrong. Precinct commander Francis Tierney (Noah Emmerich) assigns his brother Ray (Edward Norton) to the investigative task force, urged by their father (Jon Voight), a high NYPD muckety-muck who wants to bring the prodigal son back into the fold. Ray has physical and emotional scars from a mysterious earlier incident; in case you missed that metaphor, he lives on a boat that's slowly sinking into New York Harbor.
If Ray is a tarnished white knight and Franny is fairly upstanding, their brother-in-law Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell) is the devil in a blue uniform. He leads a dirty crew specializing in mayhem and murder; the only questions are how long Ray will take to discover it and what Francis will do when he finds out.
Director Gavin O'Connor and co-screenwriter Joe Carnahan take a perfectly fine B-movie premise and slow it down to an A-movie pace; in the process, they remove the juice that keeps a story like this honest. Norton does his usual fine, reined-in work but you sense Ray's calling for back-up in more ways than one. Emmerich is handcuffed by his character's indecisiveness and Voight aims for the back row - someone must have told him this was Shakespeare.
It's not; Shakespeare wouldn't have been this afraid to go slumming. The few times "Pride and Glory" jumps to life are when it drops the mournful pose and lets rip with the villainy. Frank Grillo and Shea Whigham make a frightening pair of Mutt-and-Jeff bad cops, and there's a lulu of a scene involving Farrell terrorizing a drug dealer's family during their holiday dinner. In particular, what transpires with Jimmy and the dealer's infant child is almost up there with Richard Widmark pushing the old lady downstairs in "Kiss of Death." (Don't worry, I said "almost.")
Elsewhere, "Pride and Glory" combines cop-movie clichés and self-consciousness - a deadly duo. The heavyhandedness extends to the weight of sin everyone here seems to be living under, and the weeping that most of the characters get to indulge in one scene or another. Just in case you thought the mood was too light, Franny's wife (Jennifer Ehle) is dying of cancer.
Scorsese can pull this stuff off, in part because he loves the stink and the snap at the heart of a crime movie (and in part because he's an artist). James Gray ("The Yards," "We Own the Night") walks these mean streets with a similar ponderousness, but he's an obsessive who never relaxes his grip. In "Pride," O'Connor maintains his tone of high solemnity until you're just starting to cave in, then trashes the flow with an absurd, near-comic climactic fistfight. If a director can't trust his own posturing, why should we?


After decades of Bochco dramas, The Shield , and other ''gritty'' TV police shows, cop movies today rarely have the understated oomph that guys like Sidney Lumet brought to them in the '70s and '80s. But Pride and Glory  is an old-style exception, a tightly acted and emotionally bruising corrupt-cop family drama that feels like the kind of serious, slow-burn NYPD movie nobody  not even Lumet  makes anymore.
Edward Norton is in top form as Ray, a burned-out detective whose investigation into the deaths of four cops leads him to suspect his brother-in-law, Officer Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell, also terrific). The climactic bar brawl and street beating unfortunately feel too stock, but otherwise co-writer/ director Gavin O'Connor puts a new shine on familiar material  something he also did in his previous film, the 2004 Kurt Russell feel-good hockey drama Miracle . If O'Connor is out to build a career revitalizing old movie genres, he's two-for-two so far.

 “Pride and Glory,” directed by Gavin O’Connor (“Tumbleweeds,” “Miracle”), plods across familiar ground. It’s yet another movie about the fraternal disorder of the police, in which a gaggle of brothers, professionally sworn to enforce the law and tribally committed to one another, weep and rage and recriminate against a backdrop of urban chaos. Jon Voight  — his face as pink as a Christmas ham, his acting in the same food group  — is the patriarch of this particular clan, a New York Police Department chieftain named Francis Tierney.  Francis’s older son, Frannie (Noah Emmerich), commands a rough precinct in Washington Heights. Frannie’s brother, Ray (Edward Norton), once a hotshot detective, has withdrawn a little from career and family, making his home on a leaky boat and tending to a scar on his face. Frannie and Ray have a sister named Megan (Lake Bell), whose main function in this highly male-dominated movie is to be married to Jimmy Egan, a hotheaded street cop whose hobbies include breeding, smoking, football and — since he’s played by Colin Farrell — jittery displays of misdirected intensity.  But Jimmy is also, and most consequentially, mixed up in some dirty illegal business. Right under Frannie’s nose he has assembled a squad of thugs and shakedown artists who work  with the city’s nastiest drug dealers. After four officers are killed during a raid gone bad, Ray is persuaded by his dad to head up the investigation, which leads him toward Jimmy and his crew, and also leads to some breathless shouting matches.  “Pride and Glory,” which sat on the New Line Cinema shelves for a few years, is not especially good, but there is enough rough artistry in Mr. O’Connor’s direction to make you wish the film were better. He has a good sense of the city’s wearying, exhilarating energy and an impressive ability to pull off arresting visual compositions in close quarters. Many of the indoor scenes have a raw, dangerous intimacy that keeps your attention even when the dialogue tumbles toward cliché.  And the story, while none too fresh — especially if you’ve already seen “We Own the Night” — has a certain rough potency. Written by Mr. O’Connor and Joe Carnahan (with story credits to Mr. O’Connor, his brother Gregory and Robert Hopes, a former New York City policeman), “Pride and Glory” relies a little too much on expository shouting, but there are nonetheless some fine details and powerful, tense scenes. The best stuff can be found around the edges of the main family drama, in subplots and in the supporting performances of Shea Whigham and John Ortiz (as two of Jimmy’s minions) and Jennifer Ehle (as Frannie’s wife, Abbie, who is dying of cancer).  Mr. Norton and Mr. Farrell, unfortunately, play to their weaknesses. Ray — an intellectual as well as a warrior; a gentle avenger with a troubled conscience; kind to children and tough on bad guys — brings out the full measure of Mr. Norton’s vanity, by far his least appealing attribute. Mr. Farrell, meanwhile, once again indulges his blustery mixture of menace and charm, overdoing both. He threatens a baby with a hot iron, but on the other hand he loves his children. It seems  plausible that this guy would lead a thuggish criminal enterprise, but not that he could keep it secret for more than 10 minutes.  The third point of the brotherly triangle, Mr. Emmerich’s Frannie, is the sharpest. Even though Mr. O’Connor never fully dramatizes the bonds of loyalty, love and envy that bind Jimmy, Frannie and Ray, Mr. Emmerich conveys the full nature of his character’s uneasy mix of decency and cowardice. While Mr. Voight, Mr. Norton and Mr. Farrell do most of the screaming (and shooting), he quietly and guilelessly steals the movie. If only it were worth a little more.    “Pride and Glory” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence, swearing, drug references and a bit of pointless nudity.

With its focus on corruption and family angst among Irish-American New York cops, "Pride and Glory" feels like a film that should have been made at least 25 years ago. Or made as a period piece. Heavy, doom-laden and, unfortunately, entirely predictable, director Gavin O'Connor's murky drama applies epic aspirations to a story all too familiar from any number of films and TV shows. New Line sat on the film for so long it ran out of time to release it, so the task falls to Warner Bros. to try to milk a few bucks out of it, which won't be easy.
Gavin O'Connor and his twin brother, producer Gregory, grew up as the sons of a New York City cop and developed this story together, along with Robert Hopes and co-scenarist Joe Carnahan. The sincerity and earnestness of their approach are as obvious as the plot mechanics, which hinge on the long-understood tendency of cops to close ranks and protect their own against outsiders, as well as on loyalty within a clan.
Mortal conflict among brothers is officially the oldest story in the book, so it's a disappointment that some new spin isn't put on the inevitable faceoff between smart but dour Det. Ray Tierney (Edward Norton) and his dedicated but bad-boy brother-in-law, Jimmy Egan (Colin Farrell). The family also includes straight-arrow first son Francis Tierney Jr. (Noah Emmerich) and its patriarch, boozing Chief of Manhattan Detectives Francis Tierney Sr. (Jon Voight).
Unspooling through the Christmas season, tale is triggered by a drug bust gone bad, in which four of Francis Jr.'s men are killed. Reluctantly pulled back in by his dad to join the taskforce after having left street work in the wake of a previous tragedy, Ray makes progress with his own investigation. But Jimmy has two of his own guys dealing with the situation as well, and it isn't long before Ray realizes the team is compromised by renegades. 
Soon thereafter, Jimmy puts Ray in a position where he's forced to choose between family loyalty and proper justice, and the only thing vaguely surprising about the way it all turns out is that the boys take time out to try to settle it the old-fashioned way, in a bare-knuckles Irish brawl. 
Otherwise, it's all Sturm und Drang
, as O'Connor devotes considerable time to detailing the Tierney family woes: Francis Jr.'s wife, Abby (Jennifer Ehle, with head shaved), is in the final stages of terminal cancer; Ray's about-to-be ex-wife doesn't want him back; and holiday family time is constantly interrupted by emergencies and lowlifes dropping by to bug Jimmy, leaving wives and kids high and dry.
Action is regularly peppered by quite violent scenes in which the cops beat on or blow away mostly Hispanic bad guys to get information or to avenge other cops. It's a miserable world all around, without so much as a trace of satisfaction, much less happiness. The deterministic tragedy is guaranteed to make you more depressed going out than you were going in, even if you were depressed in the first place.
O'Connor does succeed in creating a fabric of everyday working-class life, albeit a very grim one painted by lenser Declan Quinn in dark blues and blacks. Mark Isham's score further lays on the sense of foreboding. Acting across the boards is in a muted, intense, naturalistic style that periodically erupts into outbursts of shouting and unbridled physicality.


Ed Norton  is Ray Tierney , a good cop whose scar on his left cheek suggests deeper damage caused by a shooting two years ago that's left him working the missing persons' beat. The chief of Manhattan detectives, who happens to be Ray's pop, Francis Tierney Sr.  (Jon Voight ), cajoles and guilts his boy into coming out of semi-retirement to solve the case of four cops gunned down in a drug dealer's Washington Heights  apartment—cops who happened to have been under the command of Ray's brother, Francis Jr. (Noah Emmerich ), and Ray's brother-in-law, Jimmy Egan  (Colin Farrell ). Only, so happens that the four cops who were shot to pieces that cold December night—as protocol dictates, the film takes place during Christmas and New Year's— were dirty badges collecting drug money for Jimmy, who was working both sides of the alley to make ends meet. Which is not a spoiler; far from it. Fact is, by the end of the film's first 10 minutes, the audience knows precisely who's who and who's up to what and how this is gonna end. Which leaves 120 more minutes to fill—or three weeks, whichever comes first. How ironic that a movie filled with police officers should end up feeling like a hostage situation.
