Anthology films are notoriously tricky to pull off. For one thing, they�re almost exclusively the province of genre filmmaking, rendering them relatively limited in audience and, generally, narrative scope. Thanks to the necessarily foreshortened running times of each feature�s individual episodes, they�re also prone to disabling bouts of character and narrative nondevelopment, budgetary constraints, and a general feeling that everybody involved would rather have been working over at HBO, given the under-hour format. There are exceptions: For every Tales From the Darkside
 there�s a Dead of Night
; for every Dr. Terror�s House of Horrors
, a Kwaidan
 (itself a single-director, four-story work). The lush and horrific Three � Extremes
 is another welcome exception, and one so single-mindedly calculated to blow minds and provoke reactions that it�s an instantly memorable, at times squirm-inducing, assemblage as likely to take your breath away as it is to trigger the gag reflex. It helps immensely that the directors represent three of the finest craftsmen working in film today, and are backed by a trove of talent both behind the camera and in front of it. Fruit Chan�s opener, "Dumplings," sets a nervy, freakish tone in an ageless meditation on the corruptive nature of both personal and social vanity. A professionally fading (yet still lovely) Hong Kong actress (Yeung) seeks out the queasy culinary services of a witchy mainlander (Ling) who promises to restore not only her former youthful suppleness but also the attentions of her straying husband (Ka-fai Leung). By far the strongest of the three films, "Dumplings" is nerve-racking from frame one thanks to some stunning cinematography from Wong Kar-Wai regular Christopher Doyle, an intellectually chewy script by Lilian Lee, Kwong Wing-chan�s distressing score, and masterful performances from all three leads. (This 37-minute masterpiece is actually a finely edited version of a 92-minute feature.) I won�t even attempt to describe the film�s unsavory sound design and Foley work; suffice it to say you�ll never look at those strangely translucent potstickers in the same way again. Chan-wook Park�s "Cut" is next, with the director of Oldboy
 returning with a vengeance to his ongoing theme of personal vendettas. A film director (Lee) and his concert pianist wife (Kang) are held captive in their hyper-stylized home by a maniacal depressive (Lim) whose ingeniously bloodthirsty antics fall just this side of zany. Boasting some of the director�s most unique art direction to date (and that�s saying a lot), the near-flawless "Cut" is beautiful to behold and only misses the classic mark by dint of its thematically overcrowded script. Regardless, it moves like gangbusters on ketamine, mixing cornball musical numbers, broad slapstick, and gallons of the red stuff into a wholly original, entertaining work. Closer "Box," from the tireless Takashi Miike (Ichi the Killer)
 has the distinction of being both the weakest link narratively, and the most accomplished visually. While some of the compositions of Miike and cinematographer K�ichi Kawakami are as sublimely arresting as any you�ve ever seen (and frequently echo traditional Japanese sumi-e painting), the story of a generation-spanning guilt and the awful fate awaiting an adolescent acrobatic duo suffers from an odd, experimental drift that distracts from the film�s eerie charms. That said, it�s still a powerful piece in Miike�s genre-hopping oeuvre. Three � Extremes
� collective punch is both psychologically and viscerally punishing and possesses an often stunning visual aesthetic. Couple that with its obvious and genuine desire to freak out audiences and you not only have an exemplary horror anthology, but what might also be the best date movie ever, depending on your idea of a good time.


Horror omnibuses skate along the surface of our fears, content to freak us out or give us momentary shivers, and so it is with "Three . . . Extremes," a trilogy-of-terror compilation from some of the more gifted cinematic sickos working the Pacific Rim.
Gore fans will want to bump the two-and-a-half-star rating up a star, whereas those who can't handle on-screen violence will want to stay the hell away. For those in the middle, fasten your seat belts for a bumpy ride -- narratively and artistically -- and don't go in on a full stomach.
The first and best segment, "Dumplings," is a 30-minute distillation of a 90-minute feature by Hong Kong director Fruit Chan, whose much-praised films have yet to make it to the US. You can't tell what's been cut, since this tale of a vain older woman (Miriam Yeung) and the special "youth formula" she buys from a soup merchant (Bai Ling) is elegant, compact, and complete. Also intensely disturbing, once you realize what goes into those dumplings (hint: they crunch
). Shot by the legendary Christopher Doyle (Wong Kar-wai's main man), "Dumplings" starts discreetly and ends in a bloodbath, and women viewers especially may find it unforgivable. It's the only film of the three to push into genuinely taboo territory, and that's its grisly strength.
"Cut," from the Korean bad-boy director Park Chan-wook (see his "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance" at the Brattle this weekend if you want a second helping) is more for the boys in the back row of the grind house. The plot -- a successful young film director (Lee Byung-hun) is held hostage with his wife (Hye Jeong-kang) by a deranged movie extra (Lim Won-hee) -- bears comparison with "Saw," but Park has a sense of humor and a gift for nasty play. Trussed to her piano with wires that make her resemble a marionette, the wife will lose a finger every five minutes unless her husband does . . . what? That's the devilish question. It all makes for bloody, shallow amusement.
If "Cut" is too obvious, the third segment, "Box," risks being too opaque. Directed by Japan's Takashi Miike, creator of such existential gross-outs as "Audition" and "Gozu," it combines dreamlike lyricism and a tactile sense of growing nightmare. Kyoko Hasegawa plays a young calligrapher who sleepwalks through life; in gracefully overlapping flashbacks we see her childhood as a circus performer with her twin sister end in an accidental crime of jealousy. "Box" feels like a poetic, Lynch-ian response to the films of Hideo Nakata ("Ringu," "Dark Water"), but its uneasy spell is spoiled by an absurdist oh-wow ending. Some filmmakers shouldn't be rushed, but the very format of "Three . . . Extremes" puts Miike -- and his fellow directors -- in a box.

         When it comes to extreme cinema, Asia's the place, but sometimes pushing the envelope can be as banal as following the rules. "Three ... Extremes," an anthology of horror films by three of the region's most notable contemporary directors — Fruit Chan, Park Chan-Wook and Takashi Miike — that play out in decreasingly shocking order and put the audience on edge primarily through what they are willing to show rather than building any kind of narrative suspense. All three look great and the filmmakers deliver a certain artiness, but their overall triviality and the unpleasantness of the first two make for an extremely
 distasteful experience.
 
  The most conventionally plotted of the three films is also the most repellent. Hong Kong director Fruit Chan's "Dumplings" is a cautionary proposal with Swiftian undertones that youth is best left to the young. Miriam Yeung stars as Qing, a former TV star now married to a wealthy businessman, who will do anything (and that means anything
) to regain her youthful appearance. She turns to Auntie Mei (Bai Ling), a beautiful woman whose claim to be much older than she looks is attributed to the secret ingredient in her dumplings. Stopping only to break into song, Mei steams and pan fries batches of the distressingly crispy delicacy for Qing, whose desire for them becomes increasingly desperate despite some unpleasant side effects.
 


         






    The two lead actresses interact with a wanton sensuality, with Ling in particular embracing the debauchery of her role. But the sultry languor is jarred by the explicitness of Mei's preparations. Chan reveals the gruesome contents of the pastries far too early for it to have any value as a twist, and the film's dramatic payoff is not nearly satisfying enough to merit subjecting us to the visual realization of the idea. Tony Ka-Fai Leung plays Qing's adulterous husband.
 
  Korean bad boy Park Chan-Wook ("Old Boy," "Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance") contributes the macabre "Cut," starring Lee Byung-Hun ] as a successful young film director whose perfect life takes an imperfect turn. Park stylishly opens with a film within a film scenario highlighted by a bravura camera move. Ryu Ji-Ho wraps a day on his current film, which is shooting on a set that is an exact replica of his own home. When he returns home that night, the lights suddenly go out and he is attacked, only to awaken back on the film set, where he and his pianist wife are held hostage by a deranged extra (and no, it's not Ricky Gervais).
 
  Once there, the film gets stage-bound, playing out like a grisly, lesser episode of the old Rod Serling TV series "Night Gallery."
 
  The finale is "Box," Miike Takashi's mystery about a reclusive novelist named Kyoko (Kyoko Hasegawa), who is haunted by the accidental death of her twin sister when they were children. It's a beautiful film to look at, with Kyoko's cerulean blue dress and the flames of a conflagration contrasted with the chilly whiteness of a winter landscape, but its ponderousness is off-putting.

Are Asian horror movies really all that scary? All too often they feel a little too stylized and preassembled to be truly unnerving, especially considering how outlandish the stories typically are. For proof, check out Fruit Chan's ''Dumplings,'' the first and best offering in Three...Extremes , an omnibus of fright tales by three big Asian directors. Chan's chapter looks exquisite, its studied beauty provided by formidable cinematographer Christopher Doyle (2046 ). But Doyle's work props up a negligible story involving Bai Ling as an entrepreneur who cooks up fetus-flavored dim sum for her customers. ''Cut,'' Oldboy helmer Park Chanwook's out-there torture fiesta, is so hyper-set-decorated it looks like sci-fi, and everybody walks around Audition  director Takashi Miike's mopey twin-sister story ''Box'' like they're already dead. Another pulpy Creepshow  movie would be more welcome than a second installment of this stiff stuff.

Bewilderingly titled and as ad hoc as any omnibus film, this pan-Asian, neoNight Gallery  trilogy of horror shorts is nevertheless a black-blooded hoot, even if the most notorious of its hallowed psychotronistes is outshined by a Hong Kong ringer. First comes Takashi Miike 's Box , which begins on vintage J-horror footing and then detours into incest-and-psychopathy Miikeland; last comes Park Chanwook 's Cut , which dallies yet again with an absurdly epic (and cruelly funny) revenge scenario, gathering an ironic credibility by making the gory scheme's victim a successful, much envied, Park-ish Korean film director besieged by an overlooked actor. Between them, Hong Kong indie-breakout Fruit Chan  has offered up the unscary but hair-raising Dumplings , a Petit Guignol essay on food therapy and unwanted pregnancies that curls toes on every foot and may be the most viciously conceived piece of social satire the continent's seen since Tetsuo . Genre filmmakers can rarely keep their narratives airborne for 100 minutes these days, and though the two-to-three-reeler may be a lost art commercially, this sample platter's a bracing sign of the short form's vivaciousness and succinct pleasure.
