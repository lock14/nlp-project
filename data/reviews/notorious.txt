In Notorious
, the life of hip-hop artist Christopher Wallace, aka Notorious B.I.G. or Biggie Smalls, assumes the shape of the standard biopic formula. Almost larger than life in both his physical bearing (weighing close to 400 pounds) and iconic immortality (he was murdered at the age of 24 at the height of his success and on the cusp of the release of his second album), Wallace had the kind of life experience that seems ready-made for the �live fast, die young, and leave one helluva corpse� cinematic treatment. The highlights of this rapper�s life are all here: his attentive upbringing in Brooklyn by his single mom, the lure of the streets and the fast cash of the drug trade, the stint in jail, the women, the fresh sound of his rhymes, the transformative hookup with producer Sean Combs (aka Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, et al.), and the friendship and falling out with West Coast hip-hop icon Tupac Shakur (who was murdered six months prior to Wallace). Of course, 12 years later the unsolved murders remain the biggest unanswered questions regarding Wallace�s life, and though the infamous East Coast-West Coast rivalries are touched on, the film shies away from pointing any fingers or stoking the flames and definitely doesn�t implicate any police officers (as many of the conspiracy theorists do). Notorious
 is indeed the authorized version of Wallace�s life and is produced by his mother, Voletta Wallace, and his former managers and executive-produced by his label producer, Combs, and his Bad Boy Films enterprise. The script by Reggie Rock Blythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker hits all the points it needs to but contributes no new layers of understanding or insight. Director Tillman (Men of Honor
, Soul Food
) hasn�t the chops to tease out much more nuance or shading from this highlight reel, whose events are already well-known to the public. The story is narrated from the grave by Wallace, which adds to the episodic tone whereby he relates what occurred and what was learned and moves on to the next episode. Still, the performances are vibrant and capture a sense of the individuals behind them. As Wallace, Woolard proves an excellent study, capturing the artist�s verbal style, physique, and alternating personas of seductive and cagey. He�s a newcomer onscreen, which helps us accept him filling these big shoes, but he is known under the name Gravy for his career as a rapper. Luke as Combs, Mackie as Shakur, Naughton as Lil� Kim, and Smith as Faith Evans all turn in good renderings of their real-life counterparts, and Bassett as Voletta is her usual captivating self. The filmmakers even utilize Wallace�s actual son to portray him during his schoolboy years. Notorious
 won�t ever be mistaken for investigative journalism, but it will help solidify Wallace�s legacy as a hip-hop innovator while also explaining it all to those who were unaware and providing a sentimental re-creation for the legions of Biggie Smalls fans.


"Notorious" gives the Hollywood superhero treatment to the rapper Notorious B.I.G. For hip-hop partisans, watching Christopher Wallace become Biggie Smalls, then the Notorious B.I.G., must be what it's like for comic-book fans to see Tony Stark become Iron Man. Biggie's hard-knock life and premature death (he was shot in 1997 at age 24) have been repackaged into an enjoyably ridiculous entertainment about a pursy young man with mysterious sex appeal who turns the rap world on its ear.
Built around a relaxed but vibrant performance by the rapper and first-time actor Jamal Woolard, "Notorious" is part melodrama, part bullet-riddled cautionary tale, all nostalgic trip back to the mid-1990s. I left the movie more desperate for a Coogi sweater than I ever was when it was appropriate to want one.
"Notorious" was produced by Biggie's mother, Voletta Wallace, and Sean "P Diddy" Combs, his close friend and producer, which is to say it's predictably protective of the rapper's legacy. (Biggie's son, Christopher Jordan Wallace, plays him in a few early scenes.) Excepting some dirty business with the California rapper and actor Tupac Shakur (more about that in a minute), the movie's not a total whitewash, either. It hits many of the high notes of Wallace's life and some sour ones, too.
It's true that Voletta Wallace has paid herself quite a compliment by having Angela Bassett play her in this movie, but the relationship the film depicts between mother and son isn't simple. Even though Voletta, a Jamaican immigrant, gives him lots of love and a stable home in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, her son is drawn to the instant financial gratification of dealing drugs. (She thinks the white stash under his bed is mashed potatoes.) But mother evicts son, and son eventually gets busted for possession and winds up in jail.
He has a daughter with his high-school girlfriend (Julia Pace Mitchell), but his life doesn't really begin to turn around until he meets "Puffy" Combs, a big-talking recording-industry upstart, played as a dancing exclamation point by Derek Luke. (To see Luke, in track suits and an S-Curl, expertly re-create Comb's shuffle-stutter dances and to hear him chronically over-inflect his words is to witness heavenly comedy.)
Puffy is prone to offering Biggie ultimatums - "the studio or the streets" - and making dreams come true. ("By the time you're 21, I'll make you a millionaire," he promises.) Combs didn't write the script - that's credited to Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker, who's also written a book about the Notorious B.I.G. - but one imagines he had the opportunity to do some polishing.
Not everyone who pops up in the film is so lucky. "Notorious" offers up a feisty young sales clerk named Kimberly Jones (Naturi Naughton) who after a few afternoon trysts with Biggie, explodes into the lascivious rapper Lil' Kim. The movie suggests that her signature look was Biggie's idea ("Keep the suspenders, lose the shirt") and that installing her in his Junior M.A.F.I.A. collective only led to headaches since she was so viciously hung up on him.
Things only get worse after he starts dating and marries a half-white singer named Faith Evans (Antonique Smith). "What's she got that I don't?" cries Kim. Where to start: blonder hair, lighter skin, decorum.
Even with Faith, monogamy doesn't come easy to Biggie, if it comes at all. And the movie, directed by George Tillman Jr., has a good time showing the blowups and meltdowns in the rapper's relationships. It's all overblown, and yet in these entanglements, you get a nifty convergence of pop folklore - Ray Charles's love life in Fatty Arbuckle's body. Despite Bassett's steeliness, few people come to a movie like "Notorious" for acting fireworks, but some of the performances are strong, especially Smith's. She finds the wounded warrior in Evans more dramatically than any of Evans's music.
The film's dramatic crux, of course, is Biggie's relationship with Tupac, whom a shameless Anthony Mackie plays as a kind of thrill-seeking nutcase. The Biggie in "Notorious" admires Tupac, who is already a rap star while Biggie's on the rise. But after a shooting in the lobby of a recording-studio building wounds Tupac, the relationship is strained. "Notorious" suggests that a delusional and paranoid Tupac thought Biggie and Puffy set him up and never dropped his grudge. Biggie, meanwhile, has no idea what went wrong and sits home watching old footage of him and his buddy with tears in his eyes. (I said it wasn't a complete whitewash!)
While dropping some funny datelines ("The Source Awards," "The Soul Train Awards"), Tillman effectively captures the resulting East Coast-West Coast furor that culminated in Tupac's death in 1996, then Biggie's six months later. The drama around these two men riveted the nation for over a year. This version of the relationship may even stoke new debate since it tells one side of two unsolved mysteries. Yet "Notorious" doesn't aspire to be a work of journalism. Nick Broomfield's 2002 procedural documentary "Biggie and Tupac" boldly went down that road and turned up only more speculation.
While Woolard doesn't try to fully imitate Biggie's distinctive slurry sound, he captures just enough of its essence. The revelation is how with a little crisper diction, Woolard tips Biggie's raps from the blues to rock 'n' roll - there's fresh anger in this music. Otherwise "Notorious" is only loosely interested in Biggie as a creative artist. The movie stints on any psychological connection between Biggie and his songs, instead using the rapper's life to teach lessons and to offer its audience reassurances (the sky, for instance, is the limit).
After 110 minutes of the "n" word being deployed with abandon, Biggie vows to renounce it. And just like that a deluxe episode of "Behind the Music" turns into an evening at church.


As the hero of the feverish hip-hop biopic Notorious , newcomer Jamal Woolard nails the first thing that any actor playing Biggie Smalls, a.k.a. the Notorious B.I.G., must know: how to throw his weight around. Cast as the imperious-on-the-outside, haunted-on-the-inside rapper, who grows up in the '80s in the hustler's paradise of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, Woolard swaggers down the street like a mountainous gangsta John Wayne, and he doesn't just stand tall. He looms , imposing himself on each encounter.
In the movies, and pop music too, overweight people are usually outsize clowns, but the real Biggie used his bulk (300 pounds), height (he was 6 foot 3), and merciless dead-end stare to cultivate a larger-than-life presence of theatrical power: the image of a clown–turned–doughboy badass. That image eventually turned against him, and he became a martyr, killed in a drive-by shooting in 1997, at 24.   Notorious  is a luridly unapologetic trip through the violence, hunger, verbal bravado, and money fever of the hip-hop world, which it views as both liberating and destructive   (often for the same reasons). Dressed in a pin-striped suit and bowler hat, Woolard does an uncanny impersonation of the Biggie   who strutted on stage like some mack daddy from the '70s. Look closer, though, and that fleshy face might belong to a giant pouting baby. Woolard's Biggie comes on like a thug, with a voice commandingly low and grumbly, but there's a twinkle   in his eye, a look that says I'm a playa who's playing you . He's a real crook who becomes a put-on crook who is then reborn, through a rap style   so incendiary it's like spontaneous combustion, into a superhero.
Hip-hop feeds on mythology, but   Notorious  sticks close to the details, and the hell-bent spirit, of Biggie's life. Ignoring the admonitions of his Jamaican-born mother (Angela   Bassett), he starts to sell crack in his teens, when he's still boyish, friendly Christopher Wallace, going up to a roof to change out of his school duds and into his dealer's paraphernalia (white sneakers, gold medallion, handgun). The director, George   Tillman Jr. (Soul Food ), catches us up in the excitement that seduces a   kid into the hustler's life, yet the film doesn't glamorize it. Chris learns his lesson the hard way  he goes to prison  and when he hooks up with the budding impresario Sean "Puffy" Combs (Derek Luke), Notorious  turns into a funky capitalist message movie. Biggie craves stardom as freedom, as his one ticket out of the inner city. When he does the hedonist anthem "Party and Bulls---" at a concert, he flips the meaning of the lyrics (based on a song by the Last Poets) so that a critique of nihilism becomes a salute to it, and it's such an intoxicating number, who'd resist?
Biggie makes up a lot of his dark, smoky raps on the spot. He uses his words, too, to   seduce, winning over a slew of women, like the blond soul diva Faith Evans (Antonique Smith), whom he marries, and Kimberly Jones (Naturi Naughton), whom he makes   over into the ferocious skin-flashing novelty act Lil' Kim. At first, they see a big fat man acting like a sex symbol. But the movie teases out the glee in Biggie  he's like a kid with a supersize sly grin, cracking up at his own self-confidence. That's how he gets to be a sex symbol. Biggie treats his women like a harem, and he thinks that makes him a man. Does it, or is he just caught up in the pathology of what he thinks a man is? That's the question that propels Woolard's remarkable performance.
Notorious  has a fascinating trajectory, but certain episodes leave you wanting. The film would have been stronger if Biggie's pop-star squeezes were as fully realized as the women in Ray , and Anthony Mackie, as Tupac Shakur, lacks Tupac's electrifying snakish charm. Biggie and Tupac become pals (in underwritten scenes), then mortal enemies, and the film's re-creation of the East Coast–West Coast rap war, while entertaining, is too simplistic. As presented, the entire feud spiraled out of   Tupac's paranoia, his misguided belief that Biggie put a hit out on him. But why did Tupac think that in the first place? And what did these two say to each other when no one was looking? Notorious  makes the death of Biggie Smalls look like a tragic mistake, instead of the outgrowth of a culture devoted to selling the fantasy of who's the biggest man.

 Anyone looking for a dispassionate, evenhanded account of the life of Biggie Smalls, the Brooklyn-born rapper who was murdered in 1997 at the age of 24, will be disappointed, perhaps even dismayed, by “Notorious.” But why would anyone be looking for such a thing in the first place?  The movie, directed by George Tillman Jr. from a script by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker, may not be an authorized biography, but it is if anything less critical, less ambivalent, than some of Biggie’s own semi-autobiographical lyrics. The rapper’s mother, Voletta Wallace, and his friend Sean Combs are not only characters in “Notorious” but are also credited as producers. What they have produced is a messy, lively melodrama, reasonably faithful to the facts of Biggie’s life and wholeheartedly devoted to burnishing his myth.  Of course, disentangling fact from myth is not always easy. Hip-hop thrives on the tension between “realness” and embellishment, artfully blurring the line between raw testimony and fantastical exaggeration. Biggie Smalls, one of several pseudonyms acquired by Christopher Wallace in the course of his short, brilliant career, put himself forward both as a fearless street truth-teller and as an outsize character — a player in at least two senses of the word. Rather than peel away these layers of invention and self-disclosure, “Notorious” takes them all at face value, presenting its protagonist in an array of contrasting, sometimes contradictory identities.  He is a mama’s boy and a ladies’ man; a lovable teddy bear and a glowering criminal; a high-living celebrity and a neighborhood character — all this and more rolled up in the massive, slow-moving frame of Jamal Woolard, a rapper himself who pushes hard against his limitations as an actor and occasionally knocks them down. He is propped up by the work of some agile, more experienced supporting players, notably Angela Bassett as Ms. Wallace and Derek Luke as a genial and energetic Sean (Puffy) Combs.  The sullen reserve that has frequently characterized Mr. Combs in his more recent Diddy phase is nowhere in evidence. As played by the immensely likable Mr. Luke (“Antwone Fisher,” “Miracle at St. Anna”), Puffy Combs is a Horatio Algeresque entrepreneur, exhorting Biggie to dream big, to reach for the stars and even, God bless him, to “change the world.”  “We can’t change the world unless we change ourselves.” That line occurs twice in “Notorious,” and it’s not entirely clear what is meant, other than that the characters aspire to be better as well as richer and more famous. At times the movie seems to lump all those things together, to imply that celebrity, money, clothes and boundless sexual opportunity are not just the rewards reaped by talent but also visible signs of righteousness.  Which is not to say that Biggie doesn’t struggle. Early on, as an overweight, nerdy child (played by Biggie’s real-life son, Christopher Jordan Wallace), he is teased at school and stung by the absence of his father. A friend named Damion (Dennis L. A. White) brings him into the drug trade, and he and his girlfriend Jan (Julia Pace Mitchell) have a daughter while still in their teens.  Later his relationships with Lil’ Kim (Naturi Naughton) and his wife, Faith Evans (Antonique Smith), will have their moments of jealousy, rage and hurt. An early stint in prison in North Carolina gives Christopher a chance to reflect on his life and refine his rhyming skills, which prove to be his ticket out of poverty even as they affirm his commitment, at least rhetorically, to the high life of the criminal kingpin.  And its conflation of that life with the career of the hip-hop star proves to be this film’s canniest pop-cultural move. Mr. Woolard may bear a passing physical resemblance to Christopher Wallace, but his archetypal brothers are the likes of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney. In its themes and its structure, “Notorious” is a half-knowing throwback to the Warner Brothers crime pictures of the 1930s and ’40s, the tale of a kid from the wrong side of the tracks who rises high — “Made it, Ma! Top of the world!” — and falls hard.  That it is also a true story produces an extra jolt of queasy, sometimes confusing fascination. Biggie Smalls’s best songs are so vivid — and the circumstances of their making are so vividly reconstructed here — that the usual nostalgic biopic haze never settles over “Notorious.” Instead you notice that Anthony Mackie, a superb actor (notably in Ryan Fleck’s “Half Nelson” and Kathryn Bigelow’s soon-to-be-released “Hurt Locker”) doesn’t much resemble Tupac Shakur, the volatile rapper he plays.  And any hope you have that the movie might shed at least speculative light on the possibly linked deaths of Biggie and Tupac (investigated in Nick Broomfield’s provocative documentary “Biggie and Tupac”) are frustrated by its careful vagueness. There’s some attention given to the East Coast-West Coast feuding that shook up hip-hop in the 1990s, but not much new insight or perspective.  So “Notorious” settles into a curious comfort zone; it’s half pop fable, half naturalistic docudrama. Not a bad movie, but nowhere near as strong as its soundtrack. It does not explain its hero so much as revel in the memory of his many selves, teasing the audience with a promise of intimacy and understanding much as Biggie himself did, but without the same seductive payoff. The film’s tag line could be one of Biggie Smalls’s riddling, irresistible refrains: If you don’t know, now you know.  “Notorious” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, drug dealing, gunslinging and swearing.

Skim off all the bling, and "Notorious" is a rock-solid biopic with a foolproof rise-and-fall storyline and a warmly nuanced performance by Jamal Woolard as iconic rapper Christopher Wallace -- aka Biggie Smalls, aka the Notorious B.I.G. Less interested in the particulars of Smalls' 1997 slaying than in his growth and influence as an artist, the pic has a propulsive narrative drive. Although the beat-heavy Fox Searchlight release will command a rap-centric fan base, it should also hip-hop its way across demographic lines.
Helmer George Tillman Jr. seems partial to the incongruous flourish, and treats Wallace's assassination as though it were the most significant blow to literature since the death of Keats. At the same time, "Notorious" might be considered the third in an unofficial trilogy on late 20th-century American popular music -- the first two being "Bird" and "Cadillac Records."
Woolard might have starred in all of them: As the decidedly un-svelte Smalls, he cuts a figure at once sympathetic, comic, deceptively charming and occasionally cunning. He's an unlikely leading man, but then, Smalls was an unlikely sex symbol. It's a good fit, and Woolard owns the movie.
The story begins with young Christopher's nerdy upbringing in Brooklyn as the child of a single, striving mother, Voletta Wallace (Angela Bassett). (That Mom calls him "Chrissie-poo" won't do much for Wallace's gansta legacy.) Pic then moves on to his crack-dealing, gun possession, prison time and jail-cell evolution into the baddest rapper in Brooklyn.
An alliance with fledgling music mogul Sean Combs (Derek Luke) leads to a record deal; a friendship with West Coast colleague Tupac Shakur (Anthony Mackie) turns sour and segues into fatal confrontations. But a sense of doom never really permeates "Notorious," which is far more concerned with one artist's development, demons and self-realization.
While Bassett isn't given sufficient material to show her usual depth, the supporting cast is solid overall -- notably Naturi Naughton and Antonique Smith as Lil' Kim and Faith Evans, respectively, the principal women in Smalls' life. Mackie comes close to stealing every scene he's in, his Shakur emitting a natural incandescence that contrasts with Biggie's stolid darkness.
The script, by Reggie Rock Bythewood and Cheo Hodari Coker, is often too weighted with expository luggage ("My father died hustling on these streets when I was 2 years old," Combs says). The few times the social implications of the story are overplayed only serve to show how frequently subtle the movie really is.
With Voletta Wallace and Sean Combs among the producers of "Notorious," it's perhaps no surprise that their characters are portrayed as staunchly noble and, in Wallace's case, eminently self-sacrificing. And given the cloud that continues to shadow the Biggie-Tupac feud, one might expect the film to imply guilt or conspiracies. But with the exception of the 1994 robbery in which Tupac was shot (and which he blamed on Biggie and Co.), the film takes a hands-off approach to the double murders and the venomous East Coast-West Coast rap war that generated so much ink and distraction toward the ends of the two stars' lives.
The question of who was behind the murders is left largely to speculation, and the lack of danger in all this seems oddly antithetical to the image Biggie and Tupac left behind. But as Tillman wants to show, that image was largely just marketing -- a mask for the human story he has effectively unearthed from its tabloid interment.
Production values are tops, although sometimes executed with a heavy hand. Smalls is played in the pic's early scenes by his and Evans' son, Christopher Jordan Wallace.

Notorious , about a crack dealer who becomes an iconic rapper who becomes a tragic legend, is the first film George Tillman Jr.  has directed since 2000's Men of Honor , about a sharecropper's son who becomes the first black diver in the Navy who becomes the first amputee to return to active duty. Nine years is all that separates the movies—well, that and the hip-hop soundtrack. Both are rigorous and respectable biographies of trailblazers, but Notorious , despite its bigger-than-life subject and habit of dripping sex sweat at the most unexpected moments, is rather square.
That's probably because it's also incomplete. To tell the life of Christopher Wallace —the Notorious B.I.G. , Biggie Smalls, Big Poppa, Chrissy-poo to his mother, Voletta—is to also deal with his death, still an unsolved murder nearly 12 years after he was gunned down while driving away from the Peterson Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. There are two mysteries, of course: Who killed Biggie, and who, six months earlier, killed his friend-turned-foe Tupac Shakur ? Names have been named, allegedly dirty cops called out, newspapers and their writers damned and discredited for posting false information, and lawsuits filed and fed upon as they made further, nastier allegations. But, so far, no official suspects; the story ends in a trail of ellipses.
Tillman, perhaps rightly so, has no interest in walking through that minefield. Nick Broomfield , documentarian and self-promoting provocateur, already visited that treacherous territory in his 2002 Biggie and Tupac  and only barely survived intact (artistically, at least). Tillman instead revisits the well-chronicled, taking us from near-birth to afterlife—from the picked-on grade-schooler to the career in crack to the conquering hero from the mean streets rendered mythical in death.
There are no spoilers or surprises contained herein. Notorious  ends precisely where you expect it to: at the March 1997 funeral procession through the streets of Bed-Stuy , packed with boys in blue sent to keep the peace. New York  magazine had it right in its review of Biggie biographer Cheo Hodari Coker  and Reggie Rock Bythewood's screenplay last February: "It's basically the screenplay adaptation of Biggie's Wikipedia  entry."
Biggie's played by Jamal Woolard , known as rapper Gravy, who does a respectably credible impersonation. It helps that he's a first-time actor; Woolard's not just another famous face playing Hollywood  Halloween dress-up, like some of his castmates. He's imposing but also gentle, a bastard but also an angel, and he renders a young Chris Wallace 's dreams almost tangible. The anguish commingled with the ambition feels genuine. Especially authentic are Woolard's early scenes with Voletta, a Jamaican immigrant (Angela Bassett ) abandoned by her husband. For a while, Notorious  is less biopic than an engaging, heartbreaking, small-scale drama about a lost little boy who wants to make his mom proud but keeps breaking her heart.
But Tillman doesn't have time to dwell on the nobody Chris, who's too small-fry for the big-time Biggie story for which the audience has paid its hard-earned. He fast-forwards instead to the glossy, glamorous life—the fuck-the-world photo-ops with Tupac (Anthony Mackie ) before things went bad following a shooting at a studio; the change-the-world meetings with Puff Daddy  (Derek Luke ); the steamy trysts with Lil Kim  (Naturi Naughton ) and Faith Evans  (Antonique Smith ); and the nasty run-ins with Suge Knight  (Sean Ringgold ). The movie turns into a parade of bold-faced names—a hip-hop, stunt-cast episode of Entourage , but with a decidedly tragic ending.
Notorious  doesn't wash away Biggie's sins—the dealing (to a pregnant woman, even), the screwing around, the prison time. But it absolves him of them too easily by having Biggie narrate from the grave; as every deed's done, it's explained away by a ghost spouting hindsight wisdom. Such is to be expected from the authorized biography—Notorious , after all, was produced by Voletta and executive produced by Sean Combs, who do just enough to burnish the legend without tarnishing it. Just buy the records; that's the point of this infomercial anyhow.
