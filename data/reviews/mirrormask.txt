The work of fantasist Neil Gaiman finally makes it to the screen � with its innate sense of wonder intact, even � with this entertaining if sporadically overstuffed package of magic, mystery, and masked madwomen. Gaiman, a native Brit who now makes his home in the U.S., is revered as much for his boyishly dark good looks as for his writing (insomuch as the world of fantasy geekdom has a pinup boy to call its own, Gaiman is it). But it�s the words that flow from his pen � or iBook as the case may be � that have earned him the respect of the genre and beyond. His Sandman
 comics, frequently illustrated by longtime creative partner (and this film�s director) Dave McKean, have always had a timeless, epic, fairy-tale quality about them that transcends genre boundaries and places him further from Tolkien, Bradbury, and Lovecraft and closer, in spirit if not always in tone, to Machen, Dickens, and Homer. MirrorMask
 is the story of Helena (Leonidas), a teenage girl who longs for a normal life away from her parents, who run a peripatetic family circus. In the wake of a scorching argument fair to bursting with screechy hormonal overkill, Helena�s mother (McKee) falls desperately ill. Guilt-ridden, Helena goes to bed that night and wakes up in a dreamland populated by mirror images of the people in her waking world, all of whom wear outlandish, often unnervingly lifelike masks or, in lieu of that, sport human faces atop impossible animal bodies. There she teams up with the friendly juggler Valentine (Barry) � he looks a bit like King Friday of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood
 � as she searches for both a way out of her dream and a way (via a magic amulet, natch) to save her mother�s life, even as her own lusty doppelganger ingratiates herself into Helena�s real-world home. Cannily produced with the assistance of the Jim Henson Co., MirrorMask
 feels � like much of Gaiman�s work, including his new Anansi Boys
 novel � as though it had been woven together using disparate strands of cultural mythos, part pop-psychology, part-sheer flights of fantasy, but nearly all freshly formulated Gaimanisms. The Jim Henson Creature Shop is represented in nearly every frame with some new sort of freakish creature, and if nothing else MirrorMask
 makes for an archly cool millennial bestiary. Unfortunately, McKean�s film is shot through with a serious case of the Made-for-BBCTVs; from the acting (not too shabby) to the pacing (all over the place), MirrorMask
 feels like a midweek TV special, albeit a particularly inventive one. That�s not to say the film is a failure � it�s not, and there are moments of pure cinematic imagination that are wholly unique and engrossing � but simply to note that if you�re not already smitten with all things Gaiman, you may well find yourself, like Helena, a stranger in a strange land.


If the most extreme aspects of Jim Henson, Terry Gilliam, "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," and "The Wizard of Oz" were put into a stew pot and browned, you might end up with the arresting stylistic goulash that is "Mirrormask." The film will have its fans, particularly among the young and those who glorify Neil Gaiman, writer of the cult comic "Sandman" and the shaggy head from whom "Mirrormask" largely springs. Anyone wishing for a belated sequel to the 1986 Henson fantasy "Labyrinth" might also want to take a look. All others, approach with caution. Aggressive visual invention is rarely its own reward, and this movie does nothing to better the odds.
Filmed on the soundstages and in the hard drives of London's Jim Henson Studios, "Mirrormask" tells of a 15-year-old girl named Helena (Stephanie Leonidas, appealingly spiky) who's had enough of working for her parent's threadbare family circus. A gifted artist, she draws constantly in a notebook, hoping to sketch her way out of frustration and into the fantasy universe in her head.
A fight with her exasperated mum (Gina McKee) ends with the latter shouting, "You'll be the death of me!" and Helena responding, "I wish I was!" and, sure enough, the older woman is diagnosed with cancer. Stuck in her grandmother's council flat while awaiting word from the doctors, the girl dreams her way into her inner world to wrestle with her demons. And through the looking glass we go.
The director of "Mirrormask" is Dave McKean, a comics artist and visual concept guru on the last "Harry Potter" movie, and the Shrieking Shack sequences of "Prisoner of Azkaban" hint at what McKean's after here. Creating a vertiginous landscape of vast interstellar spaces and floating edifices, he and Gaiman people it with flying cats, querulous librarians, uncertain princesses, a dying queen (McKee again), and a helpful fellow traveler with a mirrored face named Valentine (Jason Barry).
Simultaneously manic and mannered, the art direction references Salvador Dali dream paintings, Goth dankness, Joseph Campbell iconography (all those masks), and the sort of workshop floor bric-a-brac seen in the stop-motion films of the Brothers Quay. "Mirrormask" is often astonishing to look at -- sometimes astonishingly ugly, too -- but the cumulative inventiveness turns oppressive and finally tedious.
In the process, the story line just about packs up and goes home. Once through the mirror (actually, the entire dream sequence seems to play out in a drawing Helena has tacked to her wall), the heroine must save the enchanted queen from an all-annihilating Shadow by searching the realm for an unspecified charm. Oddly, this is the same plot as the recent "Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D," not to mention "A Wrinkle in Time."
The dialogue works Helena's adolescent identity crisis for all it's worth. "How do you know you're happy or sad without a mask?" asks the perplexed Valentine, which may prompt furious nods of agreement from certain segments of the audience. While McKean and Gaiman pile on the metaphors for Helena's problems, though, they forget that allegory needs to be anchored to something real if it's to have any meaning at all.
Tellingly, the film's real-world scenes are almost as baroque as the fantasy ones, and that gives the game away. The visual gimcrackery of "Mirrormask" will rightly awe teenagers and graphic designers alike, but as ingeniously cluttered as this film is, it's empty in reality.


         Although the plot and motifs are largely borrowed from "The Wizard of Oz" and "Alice in Wonderland," there is something oddly intoxicating about Dave McKean and Neil Gaiman's coming-of-age fantasy "MirrorMask." The teenager's journey through a nightmarish reverie presents hallucinogenic imagery that simultaneously dulls the senses and hot-wires the imagination, but it never fully engages emotionally.
 
  Helena (Stephanie Leonidas) is a creative 15-year-old prone to performing sock puppet vignettes with the socks still on her feet. Her parents run a traveling circus in which she juggles, sells tickets and does whatever else needs doing. While kids with more conventional lives fantasize about running off to join the circus, Helena would like nothing better than to trade hers in for something more settled.
 


         






    She pours her angst into strange drawings that resemble the ink-splattered illustrations of Ralph Steadman crossed with the Surrealist paintings of Joan Miró. After she and her mother, Joanne (Gina McKee), exchange harsh words, Joanne falls seriously ill. Helena's father, Morris (Rob Brydon), tries to hold the circus together, and Helena stays with a dotty aunt in a decrepit apartment in Brighton.
 
  While waiting for her mother to undergo a dangerous operation, Helena falls asleep, and her vivid imagination and guilt lead her to a fantastical dreamscape inspired by her drawings. In the Dark Lands, fish swim through the air against a backdrop of tea-stained parchment skies, rejected books float themselves back to the library and, as in the circus, everyone wears a mask.
 
  Helena acquires a companion in Valentine, a juggler who shows her the ropes but wonders how she knows what she's feeling without a mask. They encounter odd, hybrid creatures such as creepy cats with triangular video-screen human faces that talk in riddles and doublespeak.
 
  As in Oz, the denizens of the Dark Lands resemble people from Helena's waking life. The Prime Minister (Brydon) looks like her father, and the rival Dark and White Queens (both McKee) look like her mother. The kingdom is deeply divided into a city of light and a land of shadows, and Helena learns that finding the MirrorMask is her only way back to the real world.
 
  Director McKean (who also designed the film) shot most of it against a blue screen, then added the computer-generated creations. As out-of-the-ordinary as the Dark Lands and its unusual inhabitants are, the realization of them fails to transcend the rather predictable story McKean conceived with screenwriter Gaiman (a novelist and comic-book writer with a large cult following).
 
  The scene that comes closest to matching the dark ebullience of the visuals features Leonidas (who resembles a young Helena Bonham Carter) getting a makeover from a group of patchwork automatons while they sing Burt Bacharach and Hal David's "Close to You." Undercurrents of a sexual awakening produce a subtext and energy lacking in the rest of the film.
 
  Gaiman and McKean never successfully connect the kitchen-sink emotions of the film's real world to Helena's journey through the fantasy world. While a boon to special effects and low-cost filmmaking, digital images still largely project a coolness that keeps our feelings at arm's length. Still, even with its flaws, elements of "MirrorMask" are impressive, and it's difficult to shake the memory of those airborne fish, self-returning books and inquisitive kitties.

Kingdoms of light and dark, puppets and masks startling as any at a Bauhaus ball, CG effects and digital animation employed with avant-garde panache in a live-action adventure, and the search for a magical object... it's quite useless, really, to describe the remarkable cinema fantasy MirrorMask  without losing somebody, somewhere, who says, ''Ooh, no puppets for me'' and therefore skips the trip. That's too bad, because this dazzling reverie of a kids-and-adults movie, an unusual collaboration between lord-of-the-cult multimedia artist Dave McKean and king-of-the-comics Neil Gaiman (The Sandman ), has something to astonish everyone. What you do need is time and a mindset prepared to dawdle, because MirrorMask  unspools with the rambling, intuitive digressions of a dream, especially as Helena (Stephanie Leonidas), a restless 15-year-old girl working for her family's circus, embarks on her hunt for the title item. I'm particularly fond of the Monkeybirds and sphinxes who make appearances, and I'm usually the type to say, ''Ooh, no Monkeybirds for me.''

The contemporary zeal for graphic novelsfiction, let us remember, equipped with drawings and speech bubbleshas, to this spectator, encouraged the emperor to parade before an adoring public in a threadbare Speedo, if that. For filmmakers, they're smokin' assets, serving as ready-made storyboards as well as trailing a pre-sold and, dare I say, undemanding readership behind them. Beyond Terry Zwigoff 's Ghost World , there doesn't seem to be an American subgenre entry suitable for adult teeth; it's little surprise that David Cronenberg  hadn't even heard of the comic origins of A History of Violence  before he began rewriting the script.
Arguably the luckiest beneficiary of the fad is writer Neil Gaiman , whose new project MirrorMask  is first a movie, and an illustrated publication soon enough. Gaiman's had too much success to think in any terms other than those that have earned him subliterate demigod-hood, and the film galumphs along in static panels, prioritizing flash over thought, hyperextending a story that would barely sustain a children's picture book (like Gaiman's The Wolves in the Walls , also designed by director Dave McKean ). This new, all-digital Alice in Wonderland  variation does have scores of sublimely creepy otherworldly images, from the feline guard-sphinxes with disembodied human faces (and brusque male voices) to the library whose books must be coaxed and stroked like nervous doves. McKean, a popular advertising designer and comics illustrator, has a knack for cubist creatures and a dour, pre-industrial monotonality that at various times thieves from Derek Jarman , Joel-Peter Witkin, and the Quays. (One musical number is a plagiarism from Street of Crocodiles .) My favorite: an acrobatic tribe of albino ape things with pigeon heads, whose beaks fall off at the worst times and who are eventually besieged by flying tar splats that transform into scuttling eyeball spiders.
The blitzkrieg of fantasy concepts is preceded by a laborious setup involving the plucky heroine (Stephanie Leonidas ) complaining about her family's circus life (all tinsel, little sawdust) in time for her mother (Gina McKee ) to come down with an unnamed illness. But the passage down the rabbit hole offers nominal relief: Gaiman is no Lewis Carroll , and he works in a decidedly post-Freudian ether. The ideas are arbitrary and rhymeless, the visuals inventive but empty, the good-versus-evil plot simplistic by the standards of Alice , The NeverEnding Story , and even Labyrinth  (which shares a Henson Company  parentage with MirrorMask , if not Jim Henson  himself). The measure of conviction needed to make and read comic books is all that's brought to bear, and the result might make good dope software, if you can sit still and stay awake.
