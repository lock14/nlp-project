         It wasn't so long ago that the term "military-industrial complex" sounded really scary and secretive, like something from "The X-Files" or an Oliver Stone movie.
 
  When President Eisenhower used the phrase in his 1961 farewell address, he was issuing a warning against the dangers of a large standing army, especially the kind needed to protect a vast empire. Little did he know that across 45 years, it would evolve from a favorite catchphrase of the counterculture, complete with conspiracy-theory overtones, to being an uninflected description of the power structure of the United States in 2006.
 


         






    In his incisive documentary "Why We Fight," filmmaker Eugene Jarecki ("The Trials of Henry Kissinger") begins with Eisenhower's speech as he looks for answers to the implied question of his title (which he borrows, along with some footage, from the Frank Capra World War II propaganda series). Jarecki is painstaking in his dissection of the subject as he poses the question to a host of people, from pundits and policymakers to regular folks at a Fourth of July celebration, particularly as it applies to the current conflict in Iraq, and gets an equally diverse batch of answers. Freedom and democracy are popular, but power and oil also crop up. Some argue that at times war is unavoidable while others contend that we've developed a permanent war-driven economy.
 
  A parade of sound bites lays out American foreign policy from President Kennedy to the second President Bush, and Jarecki masterfully maps the simultaneously expanding militarism, first as a reaction to the growth of communism and later propelled by the war on terrorism. Congress' complicity in the buildup completes the triangle, and it is pointed out that military contracts are dispersed across all 50 states, virtually ensuring supportive politicians will be unwilling to upset their constituents.
 
  In its size and complexity the triangle begins to resemble an amorphous monster, like the alien in "Predator," but Jarecki establishes a spirited debate in defining it. Neocons such as Richard Perle and William Kristol make the case for preemptive warfare as a reasonable post-Sept. 11 strategy, and Kristol acknowledges that the Bush Doctrine would likely have come to be even without the attacks. Liberal author Gore Vidal cites President Truman's use of the atomic bomb on Japan as the nexus in America's turn toward using its might for power and intimidation, while Charles Lewis of the Center for Public Integrity contends there is an innate struggle between democracy and capitalism and the government's increasing obligation to corporations.
 
  The most unsettling thing in the movie may be that the "military-industrial complex" has seemingly become an accepted phenomenon. No one here is denying that there exists a multifarious relationship between corporations and investment firms such as Halliburton and the Carlyle Group with the U.S. military and Congress. Perle downplays any hint of scandal in the affiliations, and Lewis points out that it's all legal.
 
  Jarecki effectively offsets the talking heads and war footage with three stories that tie the film together, providing a structure. Giving the audience a sense of the high-tech military in action — your tax dollars at work — the filmmaker illustrates the tense countdown to the start of the Iraq invasion with interviews with the two Stealth fighter pilots who fired the opening shots of the conflict. He humanizes the film through the experiences of a retired New York City policeman and Vietnam vet who lost his son in the World Trade Center on Sept. 11 and a young man who, despite his mother's objections, joins the Army because of financial difficulties.
 
  The long line of recent muckraking documentaries that has preceded "Why We Fight" does nothing to diminish its force. Nor does the time elapsed since its debut at last year's Sundance Film Festival, where it won a grand jury documentary prize, for the last 12 months have been full of revelations that generally add to the film's persuasiveness. Jarecki's well-argued, if demoralizing, documentary is a thoughtful discussion of current U.S. foreign policy and lessons not learned. It may not be the words of Eisenhower nor Washington that are needed now but rather a reversal of what historian Chalmers Johnson bemoans as a lack of the "eternal vigilance" that Thomas Jefferson said was the price of freedom.   

Even if you know that the phrase ''military-industrial complex'' was first uttered in 1961, during the final televised address of Dwight Eisenhower's presidency  a farewell couched as a warning  it's a revelation to see that speech to the nation, in all its glowering rectitude, interspersed throughout Eugene Jarecki's passionate and sobering documentary Why We Fight . Eisenhower's declaration of the power, and danger, of the new American war machine had the fervor of a mission statement, yet Jarecki's decision to use it as a frame for his movie carries its own strategic thrust. It's not just the truth of Ike's words that grips us but the fact that they were spoken by a don't-rock-the-boat Republican, a World War II general devoted to defense. Before it gets around to updating how the military-industrial complex actually works (hint: It's grown a bit more powerful since 1961), Why We Fight  asks us to revel in the irony that President Eisenhower now sounds like the sort of guy who would get tarred as a leader of the ''Hate America'' crowd.
Jarecki is no glib ideologue thumbing his nose at power. He hits us early on with the eye-opening statistic that America spends more on defense than on all other parts of the federal budget combined, and he then showcases the vastness of the munitions industry at work. At a trade show, companies such as Lockheed Martin hawk weapons systems at booths like the latest generation of computer gizmos, sports cars, or bridal paraphernalia. The former CIA consultant Chalmers Johnson describes how the B-2 bomber includes parts made in each and every state, so that congressional approval for it is all but guaranteed. The clips of eager Congress members, of assorted ideologies, groveling before weapons bills induce a cringe.
Gore Vidal, in all his trenchant cynicism, is on hand to testify to the deep structural interlacing of corporations and the military, but so is that long-haired peacenik John McCain. Each lends his own credence to the film's diary of 50 years of U.S. military aggression, which is juxtaposed with the distortions (e.g., the bogus Gulf of Tonkin incident, used to trigger the escalation of Vietnam) that too many of those actions have rested upon. Jarecki interviews Wilton Sekzer, a Vietnam vet and retired New York City cop who lost his son on 9/11, and Sekzer's outrage over the trumped-up pretenses that triggered the war in Iraq (the Saddam–al-Qaeda ''connection,'' etc.) stands in for a spreading national disillusion. Why We Fight 's analysis of the Iraq war as imperialist folly is the least original thing about it. Yet by the end of the movie, with its images of Saddam Hussein videogames, crowds being roused by the explosions at an air show, and a desolate recruit who joins the Army because he has nothing else to do, we're left with a vision of America grown accustomed, if not addictively numb, to the deadening spirit of war.

 The title of Eugene Jarecki's "Why We Fight" sounds like both a declaration and a question. While variations on these three words are repeated throughout the film - posed as a question to various Joes, Janes and sometimes little Timmy - it is clear from the start of this agitprop entertainment that Mr. Jarecki has a very good idea  why America has seemed so eager to pick up arms over the past half-century. Calvin Coolidge famously said that the chief business of the American people is business; 80 years later, Mr. Jarecki forcefully, if not with wholesale persuasiveness, argues that our business is specifically war.  Another American president is critical to that argument. On Jan. 17, 1961, Dwight D. Eisenhower delivered his farewell address to the country. Writing in longhand - one of the more arresting images in the film is the tablet on which he wrote his famous speech, scratched-out words and all - Eisenhower took stock of the nation, its recent wars and its military might. "In the councils of government," warned this president and former general of the Army, "we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes."  Mr. Jarecki borrowed the title "Why We Fight" from a series of films made by Frank Capra for the military during World War II, and it's after that war that the story of the military-industrial complex begins. It's a story Mr. Jarecki tells with appreciable energy, using images culled from newsreels, educational and military films, and original  material. Bombs explode, wars are fought, and talking heads fill the screen. The editor of The Weekly Standard, William Kristol, waves the flag for the right, while Gore Vidal shakes his pompoms for the left, invoking American amnesia. Everyone sounds smart, if not always convincing, as when Mr. Vidal states that Truman dropped atom bombs on Japan only to frighten Stalin and declare war on Communism, even though the Japanese were trying to surrender.  Mr. Vidal's assertion would give some historians pause and others an attack of apoplexy. Which raises a problem with films of this type: Who's telling the truth? Crammed with facts, or at least assertions of fact, "Why We Fight" presents a battalion of experts delivering what sound like reasonable historical overviews and political analyses. Given the sheer wealth of information, however - more than 50 years of American military history and dozens of wars and military adventures are wedged into the film's 99-minute running time - even an attentive observer of the geopolitical landscapes past and present might have a hard time separating the chaff from the wheat, ideologically framed arguments from those more empirically grounded.  To his credit, Mr. Jarecki doesn't bother with the fig leaf of journalistic objectivity as far too many nonfiction filmmakers try to do; his political agenda in this film is as clear as Michael Moore's in "Fahrenheit 9/11." Unlike Mr. Moore, however, Mr. Jarecki eschews folksy populism to sell his message; instead, he employs his skills as an archivist, interviewer and researcher, as well as the talents of his editor, Nancy Kennedy, to sell the goods. He likes Ike - or at least Eisenhower's powerful farewell speech - and he clearly doesn't like the current president, or at least his doctrine. Using a former president to shore up an argument is very canny; using a former Republican president as ammunition against another Republican president is doubly so.  One person's politically convincing argument is another's propagandistic screed, and whether you buy the film will doubtless depend on your existing beliefs. That said, even those of radical political persuasion might find it hard to accept Mr. Jarecki's argument that American militarism is, underneath the talk about freedom and democracy, a simple question of dollars. If nothing else, such thinking ignores that wars are fought not just by governments working in concert with big business and lobbyists, but also by people. In this respect, Mr. Jarecki's use of a retired New York cop named Wilton Sekzer, who lost his son on 9/11 and supported the invasion of Iraq because he believed President Bush's assertion that the two were linked, is problematic, and not only because one grieving father cannot represent an entire nation.  Mr. Sekzer is a deeply sympathetic figure, as much for his anger as for his choked-back tears. Yet his desire for vengeance, which seems to spring from someplace deep inside him and makes him sound almost Homeric, works against the film. In Mr. Jarecki's formulation, successive American governments have waged wars and conducted secret military operations for profit, and then sold these campaigns to us as necessary, even righteous. The idea is that because the public buys the lies, it also buys the wars. Too bad this doesn't explain why people buy lies, including the obvious ones. There's something comforting in the idea that our mistakes can be pinned on presidents, propaganda and Halliburton, perhaps because then it seems as if we didn't have anything to do with them.  "Why We Fight" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It contains some disturbing war images.
Winner of the Grand Jury Prize last year at Sundance, Eugene Jarecki 's documentary analysis of our imperial war machine is considerably more sober and self-contained than Michael Moore 's. Jarecki, best known for The Trials of Henry Kissinger  , juxtaposes a number of talking headssmug members of the policy elite, assorted dissidents, a recent enlistee, and a Viet vet ex-cop whose son died in the World Trade Center to give U.S. militarism a human face.
Just as Henry Kissinger appeared as a surprise force for reason in The Power of Nightmares , Dwight D. Eisenhower  emerges here as the most enlightened of postWorld War II American presidentsat least in his (oft repeated) warning regarding our "military-industrial complex." These days, political scientist Chalmers Johnson  notes, the complex is so ubiquitous as to be invisible. As retired air force colonel Karen Kwiatkowski  observes, "We elected a defense contractor as vice-president." By contrast, Senator John McCain  is shown talking from both sides of his mouth and excitedly interrupting his interview to take Dick Cheney 's call.
Much of this is familiar stuffwhich is to say, historically grounded. The title deliberately echoes the World War II propaganda films made by Frank Capra . Anyone who lived through the Vietnam  War is familiar with the litany of official liesalthough it's always breathtaking to see footage of Cheney and Rumsfeld insisting on the existence of Iraqi WMDs. Moreover, generally uncompromising and simple enough for TV (or at least the BBC , which produced it), Jarecki's film forcefully argues that the much abused word freedom  cannot paper over the conflicts between capitalism and democracy.
