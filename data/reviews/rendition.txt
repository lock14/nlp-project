Intelligent and well-meaning, Rendition
 is nevertheless an oversimplified and uneven attempt to arouse righteous indignation among its viewers. The attempt to make a politically passionate Hollywood movie is to be admired; it's just that the outcome in this case is likely to be one of mild consternation and easy dismissal due to the film's overreliance on stereotypes and diffuse melodrama. Gyllenhaal plays a CIA analyst portentously named Douglas Freeman, who becomes the U.S. government's point man at an undisclosed North African detention center, where he becomes witness to the torture of Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Metwally), the Egyptian-American husband of Isabella (Witherspoon). Snatched by government officials while out of the country on a business trip, El-Ibrahimi is held under the briefly noted policy of "extreme rendition" (concocted during the Clinton administration), by which suspected terrorists can be brought to other countries and tortured without the legal constraints of due process. Freeman at first wants to prove himself as more than a desk jockey but eventually suffers a crisis of conscience and must decide whether or not to live up to his surname. The characters are generally one-note figures: El-Ibrahimi suffers great tortures, while his pregnant wife beseeches all possibilities for assistance. Her old college friend (Sarsgaard), who now works for a U.S. senator (Arkin), tries to find a willing ear but waffles once his boss steers him off the case. Streep plays the senior CIA official, who outsources nefarious torture with a pursed smile. The film systematically jumps locations from the Chicago home of the El-Ibrahimis to Washington, D.C., to North Africa, where, in addition to Freeman's plight, we're also privy to the romance of the daughter (Oukach) of El-Ibrahimi's chief torturer (Naor). Unlike his much-lauded film Tsotsi
 about South African gang life, Hood takes on too many characters in Rendition
 and leaves them all wanting. Witherspoon suffers undo pressure to make her good-wife dialogue meaningful; however, Streep and Arkin, as always, deliver masterful snippets of characterizations. The script by Kelley Sane is full of outrage but not enough depth. As Gyllenhaal's CIA wonk discovers, it can be awfully perplexing to be a free man.


"Rendition" is a reminder that, in the wrong hands, political outrage can be a slog. The movie's title refers to extraordinary rendition, the clandestine government practice of transferring terror suspects to countries known to use torture in their interrogation methods. You can tell from that point-blank generic title that the movie wants to get all in your face. And it does.
The stars involved - Reese Witherspoon, Jake Gyllenhaal, Peter Sarsgaard, Alan Arkin, and Meryl Streep - haven't simply made a film; they've signed a petition. But the petition they've signed is so single-mindedly concerned with throwing political punches that it fails as both a movie and an indictment.
Witherspoon plays Isabella el-Ibrahimi, a very pregnant soccer mom whose Egyptian-born chemical-engineer husband, Anwar (Omar Metwally), never makes it home from a conference in South Africa. Worried and desperate, she reaches out to Alan (Sarsgaard), the college boyfriend she left to be with Anwar. He works for a senator (Arkin) who may be able to bring attention to her mysterious case.
But we already see what's going on. Before he could make his connecting flight, Anwar has a bag thrown over his head and is whisked off to a dungeon prison in North Africa, where he'll be stripped, nearly drowned, electrocuted, deprived of his senses, and questioned for possible involvement in a terrorist bombing in a public square that killed a CIA bigwig, along with several passersby. Overseeing Anwar's internment are the intended object of the blast, Abasi Fawal (Yigal Naor), the bald and intimidating secret-police chief, and the boyish American CIA analyst (Gyllenhaal) who was at the scene of the blast and whose stomach will be turned by his co-interrogator's bad-cop routine.
Kelley Sane's overworked script goes out of its way to give us scenes of a rousing terrorist cell meeting and of Abasi's teenaged daughter, Fatima (Zineb Oukach), running around an unspecified North African city in forbidden love with a lower class boy named Khalid (Moa Khouas). You can bet they'll figure into the climax. And if you couldn't have predicted where this is headed, "Rendition" is the sort of picture where one character keeps Ye Olde telltale scrapbook that spells out to another character what's been going on.
Director Gavin Hood, a South African who won the 2006 foreign-film Oscar for "Tsotsi," keeps the movie operating at a decent pace. It's handsome, too. There's even a stab at art. At the last minute the movie is whipped into one of those fractured gourmet narratives like "Syriana" or "Babel." But the big twist only makes the film seem pretentious, not merely hyper-extended.
The actors have nothing to play except positions. When his character is not righteously quoting Shakespeare, Gyllenhaal gets to be woozy on a Tunisian veranda, loaded up on shots and a hookah. Poor Witherspoon is stuck playing pregnant, and mildly naïve. "He coaches Jeremy's soccer team for Christ's sake," Isabella tells Sarsgaard in her husband's defense; and later: "Classified? What does that mean?" as if she were starring in "Legally Blonde 3." This sweet woman would never marry a bad man - and her moment of uncertainty comes and goes in 30 seconds.
Even though the camera doesn't stint on what torture does to Anwar's wraith of a body, we never get a sense of him as a man. The many plot points are meant to make both the characters seem complicated and the central issue seem global, but the movie barely captures the psychological toll of its premise. These aren't characters, though, as much as props. At least twice, Isabella is photographed with the Capitol looming behind her - once she's even doubled over in a hallway. (It's also that kind of movie.)
As the interrogator, Naor is the one actor who manages to overcome the clichés, simplicity, and cheap symbolism and create a complicated portrait of ambivalence. He's very good. But "Rendition" is interesting mostly when Streep's Machiavellian counterterrorism puppetmaster is around ("Get him on the plane," she says about Anwar). Her accent is Southern and her MO is haughty parrying - with her husband, her underlings, Gyllenhaal, and, in the film's best scene (at a gala for orphans of the Rwandan genocide) Sarsgaard.
In a sense, "Rendition" perfectly captures the certitude on both sides of the debate about extra-legal interrogation. Everybody thinks they're right. Streep's character knows she is. She's playing a one-dimensional villain, but that one dimension is the single thing in this movie scary enough to keep you up at night.


         The latest in a series of films to dramatize the internecine mess that is the war on terror via overlapping stories playing out in far-flung places, "Rendition" couldn't be timelier. It opens just a week after the Supreme Court declined to review the case of misidentified, wrongfully "enhanced-interrogated" Khaled Masri on the grounds that it could expose state secrets.
 
 Masri, a German citizen of Lebanese descent, was vacationing in Macedonia in 2003 when he was kidnapped by the CIA, transferred to a secret Afghanistan prison and tortured for five months, according to his account. When it was discovered they'd gotten the wrong guy, he was blindfolded and dropped off in the Albanian countryside with no money or documents. After years of unsuccessfully seeking justice, Masri was arrested for setting fire to a store near his house last spring when it wouldn't take back an iPod that failed within a week of purchase.
 


         






   It's details like these that make the Masri case so plaintive, complex and scarily banal and that show up "Rendition" as a pat and generic, if serviceable, political thriller. Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), the misidentified detainee in the movie, is at least spared the indignity of no justice followed by bad customer service. Anwar is an Egyptian-born businessman with a green card, an American wife (Reese Witherspoon), an American son and another American bundle on the way. He lives in a Craftsman house in the Chicago suburbs and makes $200,000 a year. He's handsome, athletic and expensively educated. If you ever get picked up by secret agents for buying a falafel while vacationing in Paris, you'll want to make sure you fit this profile or something similar. Otherwise, there's no telling.
 
 The title of the film refers to the practice of extraordinary rendition, an extrajudicial practice in which suspected terrorists are transferred from one country to another for interrogation. On his way back from a business conference in South Africa, Anwar, whose surname is one letter away from that of a suspected terrorist, is intercepted during a layover in Washington and summarily disappeared. The reason: Hours earlier, a bomb went off in a busy square in Morocco, killing an American operative. The man's death leaves a young and inexperienced Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal) in charge and sends CIA honcho Corrine Whitman (Meryl Streep) into a retaliatory frenzy. Local officials in North Africa, led by an intimidating Abasi Fawal (Igal Naor), are happy to oblige with Whitman's request that the prisoner be squeezed until he talks, to the free-thinking Freeman's growing discomfort. Meanwhile, the hugely pregnant Isabella (Witherspoon) starts knocking on doors, starting with that of an ex-boyfriend named Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard) who works for a powerful senator (Alan Arkin).
 
 Directed by South African director Gavin Hood, whose surprisingly poignant gangster film "Tsotsi" won the Academy Award for foreign-language film in 2006, "Rendition" enjoys all the perks that tend to follow that stamp of approval. The cast is so starry it could be mistaken for a night in Wyoming. Everybody gets his or her turn to shine while the poor guy in the Moroccan dungeon gets water-boarded.
 
 Witherspoon may be tiny, but her face is pure, unalloyed determination. She is all jutting chin and set jaw, and her eyes shoot beams of indignant righteousness. Streep, meanwhile, has a way of being slithery and immutable at once and proving that there are few tough guys scarier than soft-spoken ones in evening gowns.
 
 There's some poetic pleasure to be had from watching Gyllenhaal drink and brood his way to a moral awakening, but the Byronic response to the crisis of conscience is a little hard to buy under the circumstances. (It also requires enduring more scenes of torture than are probably allowed by the terms of the Geneva Conventions.) Arkin is aggressive and jovial as the pragmatic senator, and Sarsgaard is tentative and cautious as the ambitious aide Arkin's character subtly coaches in the ways of political cynicism. But aside from a subplot -- involving Fawal's daughter Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), a shady boy with a tragic past -- that winds to a clever twist, "Rendition" offers few surprises, and it tips its hand too soon and too predictably to do much more than goose your weary outrage. That is assuming you side with Anwar and his plight. If Whitman is your guy, the whole business should make you as cranky as it makes her.

Moviegoers, in case you haven't noticed, are in the midst of a siege of films about the war in Iraq and the politics of the post-9/11 world (at this point, the two are inseparable). So far, though, it isn't at all clear that moviegoers are interested. The box office tells a part of the story. One look at the grosses for In the Valley of Elah   , which for all its quiet, scalding power has yet to crack the $10 million mark, or No End in Sight   , the rapturously reviewed how-the-Iraq-war-was-bungled documentary that's had a tough time gaining traction even within the indie/art-house market, and it's clear that these pictures won't be setting any records. The Kingdom , with its vengeful third-act slide into bombs-away demagoguery, has done a bit better, the way a movie that blows stuff up real good will always do better. But that doesn't necessarily bode well for such upcoming releases as Robert Redford's Afghanistan-war meditation, Lions for Lambs ; the Tom Hanks-Mike Nichols backroom docudrama Charlie Wilson's War , also about Afghanistan; or the melancholy Sundance road movie Grace Is Gone , with John Cusack as a man who loses his soldier wife in Iraq yet can't bring himself to break the news to his children.
The dispiriting cold truth is that the post-9/11 films we've seen so far have struggled, in any real sense, to enter the national bloodstream, the collective conversation. Which raises the question: These days, when a message movie falls in the forest, does it make a sound?
Rendition , this week's furrowed-brow topical special, could wind up making a few audible squawks, if only because it's so showy and crude about a subject so inherently volatile and hard-hitting. A grimly star-studded melodrama, with Jake Gyllenhaal and Reese Witherspoon sharing actor-with-a-conscience virtue points if not a single scene together, the film takes a long, hard look at the current American policy of ''extraordinary rendition''  the outsourcing of terror suspects to secret overseas prisons, where the rules of interrogation are, to put it mildly, a bit more lax than they are here.
A suicide bomb goes off in a crowded urban courtyard in North Africa, and a man many miles away is taken into custody. His name is Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally). He's a chemical engineer, born in Egypt but a 20-year resident of the U.S., who from what we can tell has done nothing wrong. He's even married to a woman played by sweet, blond, perky Reese (who's about to give birth to their second child). Talk about a detainee who's non-terrorist material! Nevertheless, the authorities are convinced that he has taken calls on his cell phone from the terrorist who planned the bombing. And so he is shipped to North Africa and questioned. With extreme prejudice.
There's a drama  if that's the right word for it  inherent in the spectacle of an innocent man stripped naked, thrown into a stone prison hole, and subjected to such advanced interrogation techniques as having water poured over his hooded face or being hung up on chains and given electric shocks. Rendition  exerts an undeniable brute grip when it rubs our noses in the ugliness of recent American actions. Meryl Streep, as the high-handed CIA official who orders the interrogation and defends it with ''compassionate'' logic (i.e., she's potentially saving the lives of thousands of innocents), mimics the current rhetoric of the Bush-Cheney administration with a drawlingly amused corporate smugness.
Yet none of that makes Rendition  a good movie. It makes it an easy-to-scan Hollywood editorial. Gyllenhaal, as the inexperienced CIA analyst who witnesses the interrogation, looks even more out of place than his character is supposed to be, and Igal Naor, as the head torturer, glowers like a James Bond villain. Too much of the film is taken up with an Osama and Juliet  subplot about the torturer's young daughter and the boyish Islamic fundamentalist she falls in love with. Rendition  certainly makes the case that torture, whatever name it goes under, is indefensible, yet one can agree with that view entirely and still feel that the movie is just a borderline exploitation of what anyone who reads the papers already knows.
Will Rendition  find an audience? You could argue that this earnest, wooden slab of liberal agitprop scarcely deserves an audience. Perhaps it's simply ''too soon'' to be watching movies that turn yesterday's controversial headlines about the war on terror into digestible megaplex entertainment.
All the same, I can't help but wonder if ''too soon'' has become not just our explanation but our excuse  a knee-jerk justification for an America that has checked out on the promise of movies that delve into the issues of our time. It was close to 30 years ago that the Hollywood Vietnam films  Coming Home , The Deer Hunter , Apocalypse Now   began to trickle out, and though the war, of course, had been over for three years, the impact of those movies was seismic. For a while, they were  the conversation. Since we're still in the bloody middle of the Iraq mess, and images of it  however superficial  come blaring at us from the 24/7 news culture, it may be that people simply feel wrung out by it. The last thing on earth they may want to see on the big screen is tortured innocents, or dead soldiers.
Yet it's worth asking if American moviegoers, even as they've grown disillusioned with the war, now want to numb that disillusion instead of exploring it. That a film as potent in its revelations  and as dazzlingly executed  as No End in Sight  could barely make a discernible dent in the indie box office pie is enough to give one pause  . When the day arrives (and it will) that the war starts winding down, is it really probable that we'll want to see movies about it three years afterward? These films are coming out now because they're at least trying to make sense of a world gone awry, and to fill in the gaps left open by the news media. The time is  right  or, at least, as right as it may ever be. Better too soon than too late. Rendition :

 Given the tenor of political discussion these days, it is inevitable that someone with a loud voice and a small mind will label “Rendition” anti-American. (But look! A quick Internet search reveals that some people already have, many of them without even bothering to see the movie.) It is, after all, much easier to rant and rave about treacherous Hollywood liberals than to think through the moral and strategic questions raised by some of the policies of the American government. But it is just these questions that “Rendition” tries to address, in a manner that, while hardly neutral — it may not shock you to learn that the filmmakers come out against torture, kidnapping and other abuses — nonetheless tries to be evenhanded and thoughtful.  Everyone in the movie, that is, receives a sympathetic hearing. The North African police chief who supervises the beating and water-boarding of an innocent prisoner, the American intelligence official who puts the prisoner into the torturer’s hands, the senator who hesitates to intervene. They may be villains, but they see their actions as justified, something they have in common with the conscience-stricken Central Intelligence Agency analyst and the reluctant jihadist who are their adversaries.  “Rendition” may be earnest, but it is hardly naïve. Rather, it tries to be thoughtful and respectful of complexity while at the same time honoring the imperatives of commercial entertainment. It has timely issues and serious ambitions, and it also has movie stars — Reese Witherspoon with a huge pregnant belly! Meryl Streep with a Southern accent! Jake Gyllenhaal with sad, sleepy eyes! — as well as young romance, breathless chases and violent explosions. Honestly, what could be more American than that? (Now might be the time to note that the director, Gavin Hood, is from South Africa. His last film, “Tsotsi,” won the Oscar in 2006 for best foreign-language film. The screenwriter here is Kelley Sane.)  So “Rendition” is a well-meaning, honorable movie. Which is not to say that it is a very good one. It suffers especially from a familiar kind of narrative overcrowding. Mr. Sane and Mr. Hood  frantically weave together plot strands in an effort to visit as many ideological, religious and emotional battlegrounds as they can, and the result is a degree of combat fatigue, as well as information overload. The filmmakers obey the current rule in Hollywood that states that a picture with large themes and a one-word title must also have multiple, chronologically de-centered storylines. (For your consideration: “Crash”; “Syriana”; “Babel.”) But they don’t handle the complications very well, and try to pull off a third-act surprise that is less a plot twist than a logical unraveling. You may spend the last 15 minutes rubbing your eyes and scratching your head in puzzlement rather than fighting back tears.  But up until that point each story, taken on its own, yields some touching moments and canny insights. At the center of the hubbub is Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally, who stole a scene in “Munich”), an Egyptian-born engineer who has lived in the United States for his entire adult life. On his way home to Chicago from Cape Town, Anwar is snatched at the airport in Washington and “rendered” into the brutal penal system of an unspecified North African country where a suicide bombing has recently killed, among others, a C.I.A. operative. Back home Anwar’s American wife, Isabella (Ms. Witherspoon), unable to find out what has happened to him, tries to work her only government connection, an old boyfriend, Alan Smith (Peter Sarsgaard), who now works on the staff of one Senator Hawkins (Alan Arkin).  Meanwhile, back in North Africa, the police chief, Abasi Fawal (Igal Naor), when he isn’t torturing Anwar in a dank, shadowy dungeon, is worrying about his oldest daughter, Fatima (Zineb Oukach). She has been hanging around with Khalid (Moa Khouas), a poor, soulful artist with a sad smile, a motorbike and connections to the terrorists. And Douglas Freeman (Mr. Gyllenhaal), a C.I.A. analyst whose Bogart- (or perhaps Clooney-) esque dissolution was interrupted by the bombing, begins to have second thoughts about what Fawal is doing.  Freeman and Fawal conduct an argument about ends and means that is mirrored by the debate between Smith and Corrinne Whitman (Ms. Streep), who runs the rendition program with unflappable conviction. The tussle in Washington is more pointed and emphatic —  “Americans don’t torture,” Ms. Streep hisses, while Mr. Sarsgaard hisses back about due process and the rule of law — but the one in North Africa has a more pungent atmosphere and juicier acting.  Mr. Naor, with his shiny head and bushy eyebrows, is as emphatic in his gestures and expressions as an actor in a silent movie, with a gruff, rolling baritone that makes you glad that “Rendition” isn’t one. Mr. Gyllenhaal, for his part, tries his hand at minimalism, conveying his character’s ethical quandary by moping and mumbling. The two of them are an oddly captivating team.  For her part Ms. Witherspoon retains her stunned, steely resolve until the script calls upon her to start screaming, while Ms. Streep savors another chance to embody the chilly self-confidence of power. Ms. Oukach and Mr. Khouas, as the young, star-crossed lovers, have little to do but regard each other with wounded, wide-eyed longing; this is not a movie with much need for ingénues.  And yes, it could have used more subtlety, a lighter touch, a more disciplined narrative. But all its clumsy efforts are toward an honest and difficult goal, which is to use the resources of mainstream movie-making to get viewers thinking about a moral crisis that many of us would prefer to ignore. Of course it’s disappointing when such efforts don’t succeed, but I wouldn’t want to live in a country where filmmakers never tried.  “Rendition” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian ). Its torture scenes are brutal but not gratuitous or overwhelmingly graphic.

It�s not easy to make a dull film when your central components include terrorism, torture, secret CIA operations and contempo Middle East intrigue, but Gavin Hood has done it with �Rendition.� By underplaying the melodrama in the presumed hope of seeming subtle when Kelley Sane�s script is so baldly melodramatic, the �Tsotsi� helmer drains the life out of an obviously explosive subject. Despite the starry cast, this middlebrow stab at political relevance won�t muster more than fair B.O. upon Oct. 19 Stateside release.
Title refers to the U.S.�s policy (introduced by the Clinton administration, one line of dialogue points out) of �extraordinary rendition,� by which suspected terrorists can be moved to other countries to be tortured without legal restraints or ramifications. 
Which is what happens to Anwar El-Ibrahimi (Omar Metwally), the good looking, Egyptian-born, American educated and accented husband of blond soccer mom Isabella (Reese Witherspoon) on his return to Chicago from a business trip in Africa.
Anwar�s state-sponsored abduction is triggered by a suicide bombing in an unnamed North African country, which kills a top CIA case officer. Stepping into the breach is young analyst Douglas Freeman (Jake Gyllenhaal), who soon finds himself observing the well-practiced torture techniques (water-soaked hoods, electrodes, good old-fashioned hitting) of past master Abasi (Igal Naor), the local top cop for this sort of thing.
The CIA�s sliver of evidence against Anwar is records of a few cell phone calls to him from someone who may only coincidentally have the same name as a known terrorist. But that�s enough for the CIA�s terrorism guru (Meryl Streep, brandishing a slight Southern accent and too-obvious negative commentary about her nasty character) to have Anwar �put on a plane� and officially become a missing person.
Concerned, the very pregnant Isabella heads to Washington, D.C., and uses an old college flame (Peter Sarsgaard), who now works for a senator (Alan Arkin), to try to get to the bottom of her husband�s whereabouts.
Balancing this out is a surreptitious romance between Abasi�s lovely daughter Fatima (Zineb Oukach) and Khalid (Moa Khouas), whose brother leads a local radical Islamic group Abasi is trying to break.
Given that he has no expertise to bring to the table and is strictly an observer until very near the end, Freeman is an exceptionally dreary fellow, and Gyllenhaal does nothing to give him any quirks or wrinkles; all he does is represent �conscience� in the most opaque, low-key way.
Even Witherspoon, normally the most spirited of performers who can inject even limited characters and blah scripts with her own spark, can do little but mope around and search for different ways to look worried . A limited acting exercise, to say the least.  
Thesps playing the Arab characters have a little more juice in them, most prominently Metwally, who deserves some points for spending a good deal of the running time suffering abuse while constrained nude on a chair in a dungeon, and Naor, who actually gets to show more than just the vicious side of a stock character due to his tough cop character�s domestic turmoil .
Locations skip around a lot and Hood�s direction provides scant fluidity to knit them together. Physical aspect of the production is OK , although one hopes that there is more verisimilitude to the North African scenes (shot in Morocco) than there is for the Chicago section; the block on which the Witherspoon character lives was quite clearly lensed in California, as it looks absolutely nothing like any street in Illinois.

For all its brave rhetoric about 9/11 and the Constitution, Gavin Hood 's slick thriller about American outsourcing of terror interrogations is far more interested in the hydraulics of torture in exotic foreign parts than in serious debate about human and civil rights. The movie turns on the abduction at a U.S. airport of sensitive Egyptian-American chemical engineer Anwar El-Ibrahimi  (Omar Metwally ), whose only good fortune for the duration is to be married to Reese Witherspoon , gamely trying to wring specificity from her waiting-wifey lines. We find him nextnaked, shackled, and manhandled in exhaustive detail by dusky fellows answering to an unsentimental prison chief (Israeli actor Igal Naor )"somewhere in Northern Africa ." Unlike Hood's far more persuasive gangster picture Tsotsi , Rendition  feels generic and lackluster, more devoted to its preening structural twist than to a tacked-on subplot designed to show that Islamist fundamentalists are people too. If the movie has a subject, it's American guilt, but even that is tainted by the inevitable arrival, amid all the ugly-American careerists, of a good American to sort things out. Except that Jake Gyllenhaal , as the novice deputed to supervise Anwar's interrogation, is such a glassy-eyed cipher that all I could think of as he crept toward epiphany was, "God, Donnie Darko  is turning into Christopher Walken ."
