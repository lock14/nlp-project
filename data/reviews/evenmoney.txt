         "Crash," that execrable traffic jam of histrionic metaphor and presumptuous race commentary, was about as real as "Star Wars," but after its Oscar hosannas, an attack of the clones was inevitable. One of the first facsimiles out of the gate, Mark Rydell's "Even Money" is the most shameless, not least of which because it counts "Crash's" Bob Yari as one of its producers. The film's subject is not race but gambling, yet the cynical message is the same: We're all pathetic.
 
 "Even Money's" only sense of decorum is that no one refers to the corpse that flops around in the opening scene's gloomy boardwalk water as a stereotypical euphemism. The film may go light on metaphor and race baiting, but the story is scarcely grounded in the mechanics of real-world expression.
 


         






   All plot-contrivance-by-committee, "Even Money" begins with a blatant recapitulation of "Crash's" hand-wringing narration about emotionless Angelenos slamming into each other just to make a connection, though the lecture here is more abstract — some junk about discovering people's dreams to learn the truth about them. But though it asks audiences to "work backward" to arrive at such understanding, the film does the opposite by tracing the self-destruction of its characters in an entirely linear fashion.
 
 Thinner than Shrinky Dinks, these dopes include a washed-up magician (Danny DeVito), a desperate writer (Kim Basinger) who spends her family's nest egg on slot machines, a sad-sack handyman (Forest Whitaker) who risks the future of his basketball-playing brother (Nick Cannon) on a series of bets, and a community of bookies volleying for big-dog status or trying to leave the business behind.
 
 Their trajectories appear to have been charted on a dry-erase board, and Rydell buys time until the inevitable circus act that will bring all of them together by tritely illustrating the dangers gambling has on people's lives. Take Carolyn (Basinger), for example, who is too busy entertaining one of Walter's (DeVito) get-rich-quick schemes to come home to tend to her daughter's infected nipple after the brat gets it pierced.
 
 Rydell props his characters like dominos against a Las Vegas
 backdrop but deliberately and uninterestingly skirts specifics so as not to compromise the story's it-could-happen-anywhere vibe.
 
  Among other shortcomings, judging from the inexplicable homoerotic subtext that colors the relationships among the story's bookies, as well as the one played by Grant Sullivan hilariously justifying his line of work by saying he gives people dreams, the filmmakers' concept of nuance is as dubious as their sense of compassion.
 
 At least the film isn't as rash and patronizing as "Crash," which could have benefited from the gifts of Tim Roth, who doesn't take the material very seriously. He chews a medium-rare steak with the same voraciousness he munches on the scenery, nervously breaking an incriminating CD with only one hand. This wild gesture becomes symbolic of the crushing effect the film has on its audience.
 
 "Even Money." MPAA rating: R for language, violence and brief sexuality. Running time: 1 hour, 48 minutes. Exclusively at Pacific's Arclight, 6360 W.

In Even Money , an overstructured, overacted indie drama about gambling, addiction, and the sawdusty romanticism of old-time magicians directed by veteran Mark Rydell, name-brand actors indulge themselves by playing showily eccentric characters who probably seemed cool in the script. Among the denizens at the crossroads of Dreamer and Loser Streets, a brittle Kim Basinger flutters as Carolyn, a successful author with a secret gambling addiction; Ray Liotta frets as her saintly husband; Jay Mohr talks trash as a junior bookie; Tim Roth terrorizes (surprise!) as a sadistic,  far-more-senior bookie; Nick Cannon grins as a college hoops star; and Forest Whitaker wails as the athlete's older brother who's in over his head in debt.
In a tip of the top hat from novice screenwriter Robert Tannen to his magician grandfather, a sleight-of-hand man who calls himself the Amazing Abraham also kibitzes and, in the care of Danny DeVito, noodges the hell out of all concerned  except for Carolyn, who's charmed. In fact, she's so smitten that she shimmies into a slinky assistant's costume. Then the slender woman says, ''This dress makes me look fat.'' And, presto, my patience vanishes.

 “Even Money,” a scare movie about gambling addiction, is as grim and lurid as any in the recent spate of films about the evils of crystal meth. Once you’re hooked, it suggests, you’re a goner. The zombie face of Kim Basinger, her vacant eyes glued to a slot machine, tells you all you need to know. The elusive quest of her character, Carolyn Carver, for a cascade of jangling silver soon leads to roulette, blackjack and high-stakes bets placed with a murderous bookie.  Carolyn, a writer working on her second novel, wastes her nights in the casino while lying about her whereabouts to her husband, Tom (Ray Liotta), a college teacher. Meanwhile their neglected 13-year-old daughter (Carson Brown) is turning into a sex fiend. Unbeknown to the absurdly credulous Tom, Carolyn is not at Starbucks straining to tap out the great American novel but at the casino draining the last of the family savings. She is eventually befriended by Walter (Danny DeVito), a ratty, washed-up magician who lives in a trailer and hangs around gambling dens pestering patrons for spare dollars in exchange for stupid tricks.  The Carvers’ tale is one of several interlocking horror stories in “Even Money,” which was directed by Mark Rydell from a screenplay by Robert Tannen. The format is similar to that of “Crash,” which also carried the name of Bob Yari as a producer. More than “Crash,” this film sacrifices realism to forced plot mechanics.  In the saddest vignette, Clyde Snow (Forest Whitaker), a handyman in debt to his bookie, pressures his much younger brother, Godfrey (Nick Cannon), a college basketball whiz, to shave points. Mr. Whitaker’s Clyde is a shambling nice guy regularly visited by thugs who administer savage beatings. Adding to the pressure, Godfrey’s coach (Charlie Robinson) catches on to the scheme and goes ballistic. The volatile mix of devotion and desperation in Clyde and Godfrey’s fraternal bond has a raw poignancy that is missing from the rest of the movie.  At the high end of the economic scale (and the low end morally) are the bookies. Augie (Jay Mohr) and Murph (Grant Sullivan), a pair of young hotshots, rationalize their dirty work by arguing that they are merely performing a service. They break up when Augie, who can no longer stomach it, goes under cover and agrees to wear a wire for a shady detective (Kelsey Grammer).  Tim Roth plays Victor, the master manipulator and gambling king of kings, a suave, cackling monster with a pet bird. In Mr. Roth’s uncontrolled performance, Victor is a creature who would be more at home in a “Saw” movie than in “Even Money,” which wears a thin veneer of respectability and social concern.  I don’t buy that facade. “Even Money” is so devoted to sustaining shock and awe that it doesn’t bother to offer clues about the causes and treatment of gambling addiction. Except for the Snow brothers’ story, it is a swatch of cinematic schadenfreude that invites you to gloat over the downfall of fools who deserve every humiliation that comes their way.  “Even Money” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has extreme violence and strong language.

Tethered to the standard multicharacter drama conventions that can be seen most nights on ABC, "Even Money" hardly delves beneath the surface of its moralistic overview of the sins and ramifications of gambling addiction. With several parallel tales reiterating the same point -- that habitually betting past your risk point is sure to land you in trouble -- pic's primary interest is its varied ensemble and its telling illustration of the way careers rise and fall. Reportedly altered somewhat since its 2006 South by Southwest preem, pic is getting limited mid-May theatrical play that will lead directly to video slots.
Just a scan of the cast list reads like a chart of careers both hot (Nick Cannon, Forest Whitaker -- who did this before his Oscar-winning "The Last King of Scotland") and cold (Kim Basinger, Danny DeVito, Kelsey Grammer) and somewhat in-between (Ray Liotta, Tim Roth, Jay Mohr), while also serving as a reminder of the volatility of the film acting trade. The chance to meditate on the roller-coaster effects of fame provides a fine distraction from the pic's bland dramatic threads, routinely overseen by director Mark Rydell (who himself once had quite a career trajectory).
Screenwriter Robert Tannen follows the rule book of the by now standard multiplot tube skein, establishing separate storylines and then gradually -- and oh so mechanically -- merging most of them by the third act. Novelist Carolyn (Basinger) is hooked on slot machines, lying to loyal husband Tom (Liotta) that she's actually writing a book at a local Starbucks. Handyman Clyde (Whitaker) roots for little bro and college hoops star Godfrey (Cannon), but is heavily indebted on his past betting losses.
Det. Brunner (Grammer, complete with a cane and a badly applied prosthetic nose) has in his sights the evil and wily bookie Victor (Roth), who seems to have his claws in everybody in town. Augie (Mohr), a small-time and more vulnerable version of rival Victor, senses that business is about to take off. Magician Walter (DeVito) spends his time amusing casino mavens with his tricks, until he starts befriending Carolyn.
If Tannen had taken a cue from the exchange of emotions and subtext between brothers Clyde and Godfrey, there might have been something more organic and surprising about the characters and events in "Even Money." But with little exception, the course is relentlessly and monotonously downward, as if the characters were charted on a graph rather than allowed to have lives of their own.
Even those folks observing the hopeless gamblers from the outside, such as Tom or nurse Veronica (Carla Gugino), are little more than moral points on a compass. Forced to play's Tom's Mr. Stability to Basinger's Ms. Addict, Liotta is starkly limited by the script, an issue that applies to the ensemble up and down the line.
Whitaker nearly does break through his role's schematic boundaries, and works up considerably warm chemistry with the charismatic Cannon. Basinger literally sweats through a thankless role, while Roth, mired in typecasting, falls back on his only option, which is to mug. 
In one of his better perfs to date, Mohr suggests the intense pressures felt from a young bookie's perspective. DeVito (also a producer) seems to be enjoying himself, even if he feels like a refugee from a David Mamet film. Grammer's noirish gumshoe act similarly seems -- despite a last-minute twist -- to belong in another film.
For a film that should be swimming in nocturnal urban stench and fateful atmospherics, Rydell (with lenser Robbie Greenberg) creates little mood beyond the most conventional sort. Standard-issue directorial approach is perfectly in keeping with a script whose natural berth is on the tube.

Perhaps I'm still nursing the blowback burns of Smokin' Aces , but it was refreshing to see the casinos in Even Money  presented as a dreary, bourgeois skid row. Unfortunately, that's about all this treatise on the perils of gambling has got in the freshness department, as Mark Rydell 's impressive cast humps through debts induced and collected toward the big game, where various storylines converge. Kim Basinger  is a blocked writer who lies to her husband (Ray Liotta ) with alarming ease; having blown the family savings on the slots, she is in deeper than Forest Whitaker , though he's in more troublebeholden to both his basketball star brother (Nick Cannon ) and two bookies whose first resort is violence. Kelsey Grammar  bookends the film as a crippled detective; Danny DeVito  is a washed up magician; and Tim Roth  plays an oily number two to the mysterious kingpin. The problem with ensemble films, and this one in particular, is that they often flit instead of float between story arcs. With deep lags in momentum, it is this lack of cohesion that nearly cancels out what can be great about ensemble films: the performances.
