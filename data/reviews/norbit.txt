Murphy doesn�t just put on a dress this time around in playing the grossly obese Rasputia in Norbit
 � his wardrobe changes run the gamut of bad taste, ranging from a hot-pink velour sweatsuit to a fuschia two-piece bathing suit that will sear itself into the nether recesses of your memory. Actually, it�s not so much the clothes that make Rasputia as it is the mounds and mounds of flesh that surround them. This is a character that literally fills the screen. If you don�t appreciate the vulgar pleasures of broad comedy, the ongoing fat joke in Norbit
 will likely strike you as misogynistic and mean-spirited, which may not be too far off the mark. Unlike the female characters Murphy portrayed in The Nutty Professor
 and its sequel � the nurturing Mama Klump and the perpetually horny Granny Klump � Rasputia is purposely one-dimensional in the way she terrorizes her dweeb husband, Norbit (Murphy again), and everyone else within distance. (Even children and dogs aren�t safe around her.) While Rasputia�s blind-rage tantrums can be pretty funny stuff � you can tell that Murphy is clearly having a ball, twitching and jabbering prior to one of her tirades � there�s little here to pull you into the storyline and elicit your sympathies for poor Norbit�s marital predicament. Consequently, a rekindled romance with his childhood sweetheart (a too thin Newton) comes off as fake and even more extraneous than the romantic subplots in the Klump movies. As in those films, however, the fun in Norbit
 is watching Murphy at work � the guy has a knack for bringing the physicality of his comic characters to life. He plays three roles here, including Norbit�s adopted father, a stubborn Chinese immigrant with no sense of political correctness, and they�re all fully realized in the physical sense but sadly lacking otherwise. It�s too bad that the script doesn�t serve Murphy�s multicharacter talents in the way he deserves. If and when it ever does, he may actually make a comedy for the ages.


A Saturday evening. The phone rings.
"Hello?"
"Hey, girl."
"Oh, hey. What's going on?"
"Nothing. I just saw that Eddie Murphy movie 'Norbit,' where he plays both the nerd with an overbite, big glasses, and a puffy little Afro, and 
the obnoxious fat woman he marries."
"That's funny, I went last night. And I'm at a loss. I laughed and all. But it was also dumb and coarse and sometimes boring and a little bit sad. I mean I know Eddie Murphy is a great comedian, and I'm happy for his Oscar nomination for 'Dreamgirls' and that his career's on a roll again -- and I mean I'll support a brother. But when's he gonna try to do some August Wilson. 'Cause this 'Norbit' is some seriously regressive -- "
"I'm feeling you on this. He still doesn't like women."
"I've been saying that since 'Delirious.' "
"This movie belongs in the Black Stereotype Hall of Fame, from the three shiftless schemers to the two funky pimps. It is interesting that Eddie decided to play the most offensive characters himself -- the wife, Rasputia, and the kindly, racist Chinese dude who raises Norbit."
"The only recommendable thing about Norbit is that he's not as bad as every other person in this movie. It's like these weird defects in Eddie's psychology are OK because he can make entertainment out of them."
"Comedians do that all the time. But his biggest defect is about us
. We're not as big as Rasputia, but we're not dainty, either. And this movie is about an evil obese chick. She's jealous and petty and lazy and greedy and gross and ignorant. Did you see yourself in her? 'Cause I didn't."
"No. But what's weird is how she's not meant to be a satire on a particular type of person. She's like just a pure living nightmare, the reason why so many men chase Paris Hilton and the Pussycat Dolls. Norbit never loved her. He married her because her no-good idiot brothers -- two bodybuilders and one slick dude -- pretty much force him to. She goes crazy when Thandie Newton shows up playing his childhood sweetheart, who's a lot thinner. The dark-skinned fatty versus the fatless hottie. It's Lena Horne versus Ethel Waters all over again."
"Or 'Dreamgirls.' "
"Is it me or did it seem like the people making this movie went out of their way to make Thandie look a lot lighter than Rasputia?"
"It's not you. They definitely gave her the Barbra Streisand lights."
"It was also like every time Rasputia starts to seem real in an understandable, human way, like when she tells Thandie she's too thin out of actual jealousy, the movie makes her do something stupid in the next scene."
"Oh, like when she torpedoes down that water slide in the bathing suit."
"The joke is never how skinny Thandie is. And Rasputia is right: Thandie needs to eat. The joke is how Rasputia's exposed celluloid jiggles and how this great big woman is capable of flying through the air with so much ease."
"I was embarrassed for her because she was too dumb to be embarrassed for herself."
"But I was embarrassed for Thandie, too."
"What is going on with her? Remember her in 'The Truth About Charlie'? Where's that
 movie star?"
"I didn't see that movie. But I'm always rooting for her. I hate seeing her so shrill and strident, like in 'Crash' and in 'The Pursuit of Happyness. ' "
"She looked a hot mess in that movie."
"She looked strung out and nuts so Will Smith would look good."
"At least in 'Norbit,' she's not crazy."
"But she's an airhead. I mean, seriously: Who agrees to marry Cuba Gooding Jr. anymore?"
"I forgot he was in this movie."
"He plays her golddigger boyfriend."
"What happened to his 
career?"
"Girl, we don't have time."
"Well, let's get back to my original concern. What are these black comedians doing for us?"
"If we're not 500 pounds and insane, we're 50 pounds and stupid."
"Look at Big Momma. Look at Tyler Perry and that Madea character."
"Come on. I like Tyler Perry."
"He doesn't hate women the way it seems like Eddie Murphy does. I'll give you that. But the point is that these men are dictating how normal and big black women play in the movies. I can't think of a woman who would waste her time playing a fat black dude for laughs."
"I don't think our narcissism works that way. If a black woman gets the chance to carry a movie, or, heaven forbid, direct one, we wouldn't have time for a frivolous mess like 'Norbit." We'd have to make something that matters
."
"That's the worst news of all about these brothers in drag. It means another black woman is out of a job."
"I'm convinced if Eddie Murphy had his way. He would have played his part in 'Dreamgirls' and
 Jennifer Hudson's."
"Don't even go there."
"Well, with this movie likely to top the box office when the Oscar polls close on February 20, Eddie should just be glad there are barely any big-boned black women in the Academy to vote for somebody else."
"Mmm hmm. You go, Marky Mark!"


         Physical transformation or not, "Norbit" is unlikely to send Eddie Murphy back to the Kodak Theatre in a year's time. But why grouse when the movie qualifies him for even greater honors? Surely some humanitarian organization will recognize the selflessness with which Murphy has taken three of the movie's major roles, thus saving two other actors from a nasty black mark on their résumés.
 
  Had Murphy not snapped up the role of Rasputia, the bulging bête noire of the movie's emasculated hero, the job of serving as the butt of the movie's endless string of fat jokes would have fallen to an honest-to-goodness actress, who might not have borne the serial humiliation with anything like Murphy's grace.
 


         






    Of course, an honest-to-goodness actress might also have brought some humanity to the role, which would have squarely derailed the movie's plan of attack. Murphy's mild, bespectacled nerd may get top billing, but Norbit is essentially a monster movie, with Rasputia's designs on Norbit closely resembling Godzilla's plans for Tokyo.
 
  Although she is first seen shielding the orphan Norbit from a pair of sandbox bullies (Murphy graciously cedes both roles to 9-year-olds), Rasputia is quickly transformed into a short-tempered leviathan. After a brief montage of bone-crushing nuptial bliss, Norbit emerges as a henpecked husband choking on his substantial ball and chain, a pantywaist literally smothered by his wife's clutching affections.
 
  Hope arrives in the impossibly thin form of Norbit's childhood love Kate (Thandie Newton), but obstacles stand in their way — for starters, Rasputia's mountainous, muscle-bound brothers and Kate's secretly on-the-make fiancé (Cuba Gooding Jr.). There's also business involving the fate of the orphanage where both Norbit and Kate were raised, currently run by the foul-mouthed, obstreperous Mr. Wong (Murphy, yet again). But in essence, Norbit's quandary boils down to a choice between the fat girl and the skinny girl. The Lady, or the Whale? (Should the latter seem like an unkind epithet, let us point out that Mr. Wong's otherwise unmotivated interest in harpooning does not go to waste.)
 
  There is, of course, no question which Norbit should choose, although the fact that Kate looks as though she might explode if placed in close proximity to food might give a wiser man pause. Rasputia is a thoroughly repellent creation, as reductive in conception as she is expansive in girth. To be fair, she is only one among the movie's gallery of lazy stereotypes, which include a pair of jive-talking pimps (Eddie Griffin and Katt Williams), a flamboyant aerobics instructor (Marlon Wayans) and an Italian restaurant owner (Anthony Russell) with Old World speech patterns and a dining room filled with red-checked tablecloths.
 
  Murphy and his brother Charlie, who collaborated on the screenplay, seem to have drawn the wrong lesson from the latter's stint on "Chappelle's Show." Where Dave Chappelle used stereotypes to confront prejudice, the Murphys (and their co-screenwriters Jay Scherick and David Ronn) merely squeeze a few grudging drops from caricatures that were wrung dry in the age of vaudeville.
 
  In "Dreamgirls," Murphy gave a performance of uncommon discipline, channeling his talent for mimicry into the character of a protean soul singer who barely exists when he's not on stage. "Norbit's" director, Brian Robbins, has no interest in shaping Murphy's schtick. His idea of direction is to plant the camera and let Murphy do his thing. Digital technology has eliminated the doorframes and lampposts that were once a staple of dual-role performances, but no one has invented a way to curb the ego of a screen-hogging actor whose idea of shaping a scene is to start loud and get louder.
 
  The one member of Norbit's team who can hold his head high is makeup artist Rick Baker, who oversees Murphy's mightily impressive physical transformations. Were it not for the distinctive indulgence the camera lavishes on him no matter what part he's playing, Murphy would be virtually unrecognizable under his layers of latex. But changing the package doesn't change the product, nor the fact that it's well past its sell-by date.
 
  "Norbit." MPAA rating: PG-13 for crude and sexual humor, some nudity and language. Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes. In general release.   

In Norbit , Eddie Murphy is like a xylophone player who keeps banging away on the same two discordant notes; unfortunately, those monotonous, off-key tones are the characters he's playing. As Norbit, an aviator-framed nerd who's like a human punching bag out of the worst urban sitcom of 1974, Murphy speaks in a breathy lisp, as if his mouth had been partially buttoned shut, and he doesn't give himself the nerd's traditional redeeming feature of a geeky, slide-rule intellect. Norbit, all frozen gawk, is just a very dim bulb.
He is married, for some reason, to Godzilla...I mean, Rasputia, a shrieking, scowling terror, her limbs dripping with fat, played by Murphy with enough head swivels, angrily wagged fake fingernails, and sassafras ''attitude'' to make Martin Lawrence's Big Momma and Tyler Perry's Madea look like the Brontë sisters. (In a smaller role, Murphy also plays Norbit's adoptive father, the unfunny Asian stereotype Mr. Wong.) Yet here, once again, the character has no glee, no happy raunchy devil inside. She's just a scratchy-voiced monstrosity, an excuse for Murphy to strut around wearing the latest in fat-suit technology.
Now, there's where Norbit  is impressive. When Rasputia shows up in a bikini, you don't just see the rolls of blubber; you see dimples and stretch marks  you see cellulite . The spectacle of spilling, jiggling flesh, served up via the wizardry of Rick Baker, is so convincing that it makes a mockery  an irrelevance  of Eddie Murphy's gifts.


Eddie Murphy once again taps into his inner Jerry Lewis -- and his idea of a big, fat, overbearing wife -- in "Norbit," playing a meek hubby and his hopelessly domineering 500-pound-plus wife. Murphy continues his ongoing gambit for playing multiple characters in various shapes, sizes and races, but his story (conceived with brother Charles) lacks even the basic form that held most of "The Nutty Professor" together. Thesp's fans will flock to this low-ball item that arrives just as he's in the Oscar spotlight -- a coincidence that will only boost early February B.O. 
"Broad" may be the obvious word to describe the movie, but it doesn't begin to suggest its nasty side -- its contemptuous depiction of plus-size African-American women.
Narrating his own unfortunate childhood, Norbit (Murphy) describes how his parents literally tossed him outside the Golden Wonton Orphanage just after he was born in 1968. Raised by owner Mr. Wong (Murphy, again), Norbit becomes close friends with cute little girl Kate (China Anderson), who's then adopted and taken away.
Just as orphan bullies are about to cream the shy Norbit, he's protected by a hefty 10-year-old girl named Rasputia (Lindsey Sims-Lewis), who effectively wraps him up in her arms and never lets him go.
Now, the adult Norbit finds himself caught in severe wedlock with Rasputia (Murphy, once again), enforced by her three physically intimidating brothers (Terry Crews, Clifton Powell, Lester "Rasta" Speight), who run a shady construction company. More than anything else, "Norbit" depicts four huge black folks basically terrorizing an all-American town that's somewhat integrated but feels lily-white.
The racial politics of this curious situation are bypassed and deflected by Mr. Wong, who ultimately admits he hates both blacks and Jews -- while acknowledging that both groups love Chinese food.Norbit may have found his way out of his domestic hell with the return of Kate (who's all grown up into Thandie Newton). A pretty reed of a woman next to the repulsive mound of undulating flesh and boobs that is Rasputia (care of Rick Baker's special effects makeup), Kate offers hope to Norbit until she introduces her fiance, Deion (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). What Kate doesn't realize is that she's engaged to a con man who's about to work a deal with Rasputia's brothers to get hold of Wong's orphanage and turn it into "a titty bar."
Director Brian Robbins, whose specialty is sweet-minded sports movies and most definitely not knee-to-groin slapstick, inserts physical set pieces into the predictable romantic comedy storyline that have no flow or comic inspiration. The most that can be managed is a ridiculous number where Rasputia -- in her red string bikini -- takes a ride down a water-park slide and nearly squashes little girls.
The more Murphy the actor and writer tries to tap into Lewis, the further he gets from what made Lewis' best work such a marvel of camera and comedian in tandem. Murphy plays Norbit as mentally slow and even just dumb, but it finally doesn't ring true, since Norbit, like a really smart guy, is able to turn the tables on Deion.
Where Murphy goes to town is with Rasputia, and even the act of wearing what looks like seven layers of flesh makeup doesn't stop him from delivering some of his patented drop-dead expressions. Still, it's not hard to detect this creature as the object of something like pure hate by four male screenwriters. Comedy like this isn't pretty.
Murphy's Wong trucks in pure stereotype, but at least Newton counters all of this with some recognizably human behavior and vulnerability. Eddie Griffin turns up from time to time as a loud-mouthed pimp.
Production is a pro studio product through and through, down to the outdoor sets, which are obviously studio backlots.
