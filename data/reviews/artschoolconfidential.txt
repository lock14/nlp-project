         If a more elegant and succinct explanation of what compels some people to go to art school has ever been filmed, I haven't seen it. Terry Zwigoff's "Art School Confidential" begins with a steady, mostly silent (except for a rhythmic pounding of fist on nose) shot of a skinny kid getting his face bashed in by the school bully. Cut to the same kid standing in front of the class wearing a beret and a striped shirt, saying, "I am a genius. I am the greatest artist of the 20th century. I am Pablo Picasso," and the picture is complete. A portrait of the artist as a young man getting his face kicked in.
 
 The second "Eightball" comic-inspired collaboration between cartoonist Daniel Clowes (who wrote the screenplay) and Zwigoff ("Crumb," "Ghost World"), "Art School Confidential" is based on Clowes' hilarious 1991 four-page screed against "the biggest scam of the century." It featured Clowes, a Pratt Institute graduate, as an undercover agent blowing the lid off "rich guys who draw worse than your 7-year-old sister," "has-been famous-artist professors who couldn't teach a dog to bark," "self-obsessed neurotic art-girls who make their own clothes" and "everybody's most dreaded model combo — the hideous hirsute hippie girl and her freakish, poodle-haired boyfriend."
 


         






   The movie takes a slightly more tempered (but only slightly), even melancholic view of an institution that in the old days, as Clowes explains in the comic (but not in the movie), "taught practical techniques to the eager, dedicated few who possessed the temperament to keep up with a demanding curriculum," but has devolved into a place where "anyone with a trust fund can excel in classes that are little more than vague pep talks designed to keep enrollment up." The movie still mercilessly pegs and catalogs the art student archetypes (a barefoot hippie girl steps out of the parental car and straight onto broken glass on the first day of school), as well as the embittered, never-were teachers (John Malkovich is dead-on as the married bisexual painter of triangles who can't get a show); the contemporary art world; superstar artists; empty-nest moms looking to get in touch with their creative sides and egotistic tastemakers (Steve Buscemi is Broadway Bob, whose café launches and loses every next big thing to come down the pike).
 
 At least one of the art models is the beautiful, sophisticated Audrey (Sophia Myles), whose nude portrait appears in the college catalog, and who may be responsible for a good portion of every freshman class. Jerome Platz (Max Minghella) falls for the girl in the picture, as well as the picture of the school, but the Strathmore Institute (named after the sketch pads) is a crumbling manse in a borderline neighborhood where a serial killer has been hard at work.
 
 On his first day at school, he meets his roommates, Matthew (Nick Swardson), a still-closeted fashion major, and Vince (Ethan Suplee), an obnoxious film major who talks to his grandfather like a film financier. (Which, naturally, he is.) He also befriends Bardo (Joel David Moore), a "gradual student," as they used to be called, who has switched majors and hung around long enough to have everybody pegged. It's Bardo who begins the work of dismantling Jerome's illusions, and introduces him to Jimmy (the excellent and truly terrifying Jim Broadbent), a raging, slivovitz-chugging failed artist (and Strathmore grad) with a serious misanthropic streak.
 
 Jerome's growing disappointment with school — he's arguably the most technically skilled in his class, and the most underappreciated — reaches critical mass when class and teacher alike start heaping praise on the inept oeuvre of the freakishly mainstream Jonah (Matt Keeslar), who looks like a narc and paints like Grandma Moses. When Jonah attracts the simultaneous attention of Audrey and Broadway Bob, Jerome resorts to desperate measures — the only kind that will get you anywhere in this milieu.
 
 A low-key satire of the consensual illusion of art world success, "Art School Confidential" deftly evokes the peculiar, funny-sad heartbreak of the aspiring genius. As Professor Sandiford (Malkovich) tells his students on the first day of class, "If you want to make money, go to banking school or website school . Only one in 100 of you will make a living in your chosen field." The movie omits my favorite line in the comic, because by then it doesn't need to be said. You can sense the thought bubble rising from the class's collective mind: "I'll be that one."

Insistently sullen, nihilistic, and successful to the point of smugness at transmitting buzzkill, Art School Confidential  is the second collaboration between art-house cartoonist Daniel Clowes and director Terry Zwigoff. The first, of course, was 2001's haunting Ghost World , taken from the pages of Clowes' fine subterranean homesick graphic novel about two teenage outsider girls and one middle-aged outsider guy, the three of them itchy under their cloaks of irony. And the success of the creative collaboration was enhanced by the ability of lithe actors Thora Birch, Scarlett Johansson, and Steve Buscemi to suggest the painfully tender skin beneath all that emotional armor  in a movie that provided space to expose those bruises.
Any such points of entry and empathy are missing in this follow-up, which stars Bee Season 's Max Minghella, all full-lipped and Candide-like, as a teenage outsider named Jerome Platz who plans on becoming the most famous artist in the 21st century  bait, he hopes, for attracting girls. (It worked for Picasso.) Accepted into a prestigious institution of higher art making, Jerome (his name suggesting an alienated type out of a J.D. Salinger story) works doggedly, if unexceptionally, at his drawings. But surrounded by poseurs, phonies, goof-offs, blowhards, and members of the artsirati  including John Malkovich as a snakish teacher, Ethan Suplee as a talentless would-be filmmaker, and Jim Broadbent as a fetid failure of an alumnus  Jerome learns that the reality of art-world success has nothing to do with talent, and everything to do with scheming. He also falls in love with an attractive life-drawing model (Tristan & Isolde 's Sophia Myles) and learns that muses can be shallow, too.
Life, in other words, stinks. And artists (of which Clowes and Zwigoff are esteemed avatars of the hipster set) stink even more; in fact, as Art School Confidential  spreads its stain of bitterness, artists are dismissed as no better than murderers. (By the way, there's a serial killer on the loose.) Everybody's got the makings of a phony in him, just waiting to crawl out and accept a grant, an offer of easy sex from an ''art school skank,'' a one-man show.
And the point is? Well, nil, which is a problem. It is a phenomenon worth noting when Malkovich's antics seem mild and when Steve Buscemi (who cameos as a status-conscious restaurant owner preening about his ties to hot artists) must substitute volubility for motive. Zwigoff, who made a great biographical documentary about the original dark cat of underground comix, R. Crumb, in 1995, and the best dyspeptic antidote to Christmas treacle ever with 2003's Bad Santa , gets so deep into self-flagellation  or maybe it's exhibitionism  that at some point he and Clowes (who wrote the screenplay, based on his own comic-book story) turn the project into a tantrum against sincerity, an excoriation of anyone so foolish as to want to take a class and, maybe, learn something. Whether the joke's meant to be on us or on the storytellers, I'm not buying the punchline.

 We first encounter Jerome Platz, the hapless hero of Terry Zwigoff's hapless "Art School Confidential," at the business end of a bully's fist. Picked on and misunderstood as a schoolboy, Jerome quickly grows up into Max Minghella (son of Anthony, who directed "The Talented Mr. Ripley" and "Cold Mountain"), a young man whose dark brows and big sad eyes are taken here as the signs of a delicate artistic temperament.  Jerome seeks refuge from all that is crass and phony in the suburbs at Strathmore Academy, an art school in a section of New York City so rough that the smoking laws are never enforced and a serial killer ranges freely, strangling his victims when the mood strikes or the film's rickety plot seems to require it.  Strathmore turns out to be just as crass and phony as anywhere else, only in a more specialized way. Jerome, a gifted draftsman, rooms with a queeny fashion-design major (Nick Swardson) and a boorish film student (Ethan Suplee). Mostly, though, he encounters the kind of cutthroat pretentiousness that Claire Fisher had to contend with in the later seasons of "Six Feet Under."  In his life-drawing class Jerome befriends Bardo (Joel David Moore), a super-jaded older student who identifies everyone, himself included, according to art-school stereotypes. The movie, based on a screenplay by the comic-book artist Daniel Clowes, occasionally tries to rise above such caricature. But in spite of some acute observations and a few interesting performances (most notably from John Malkovich as Jerome's drawing teacher and the ever-reliable Jim Broadbent as Strathmore's least illustrious alumnus), "Art School Confidential" is a dull and dyspeptic exercise in self-pity and hostility.  In their previous collaboration, the near-perfect "Ghost World," Mr. Clowes and Mr. Zwigoff used adolescent misanthropy as both a method of analysis and an object of satire. Enid, their heroine, was mean-spirited but also clear-sighted, and she served as a sympathetic foil for the audience and the filmmakers alike. Jerome is a murkier, mopier character, and the movie grinds its gears, much as he does, between defiant romanticism and nasty cynicism.  For his part Mr. Minghella seems to absorb his character's passivity and indecisiveness. He has a captivating pout, but not much going on behind it. Jerome's ambition to become "the greatest artist of the 21st century" is mocked, but also defended, since Jerome's sincerity is what distinguishes him from the poseurs, careerists and dilettantes who have hijacked the title artist from nobler souls like himself.  The others might say cutting things in classroom critique sessions to score easy points, but Jerome does it because he cares about aesthetics. They might lust after nude models, but Jerome is really in love with one. Her name is Audrey (she's played by the unexpressive Sophia Myles), and that she is the daughter of a famous artist doesn't hurt. Or maybe it does, since Jerome's motives turn out to be as confused as the film's.  At times it seems to be telling a familiar story of idealism and disillusionment, in which a young man's dreams of glory are dashed and his principles corrupted. But the movie also suggests that the chip on Jerome's shoulder is earned, since he is not only purer of heart than his fellow students, but also possesses more talent.  One thing we notice right away is that he can really draw, unlike the pretenders who fill fish tanks with Ping-Pong balls or scribble incoherently on paper. That Jerome's technical skill goes unrewarded is central to Mr. Clowes and Mr. Zwigoff's more or less conservative complaint against the trendiness of the art world, which in their not entirely inaccurate view trails after empty fads and mints undeserving celebrities.    Jerome's main rival is Jonah (Matt Keeslar), a handsome square (to say just how much of a square would be to give away a dumb but amusing plot twist) whose amateurish paintings inspire almost universal enthusiasm. "It's as if he's unlearned everything," gushes one admirer.  The same, unfortunately, might be said of Mr. Zwigoff, whose indifference to basic filmmaking technique seriously undermines his movie's defense of painterly skill. A movie about art does not need to be pretty, but it should at least look like something. "Ghost World" looked, appropriately enough, like a comic book, its shots static and coherent and its pacing deliberate and clear. "Art School Confidential," in contrast, is indifferent to the niceties of framing, lighting and narrative rhythm, as muddled and hectic as a student art project pulled off in a single, desperate, caffeine-fueled all-nighter.  "Art School Confidential" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, grisly violence and drawing-class nudity.

If the names of director Terry Zwigoff and screenwriter Daniel Clowes weren't prominently credited on "Art School Confidential," this melancholy comedy might be mistaken for an inferior imitation of their "Ghost World." The thematic and tonal overlap between the two films is considerable, and this second collaboration is entirely true to the idiosyncratic spirit of that earlier work. But despite a soulful leading performance from Max Minghella, pic feels insubstantial, echoing without equaling both the coolly ironic edge and heart of "Ghost World" and the incisive art-world outsider portrait of the director's docu feature, "Crumb." Breakout beyond specialized niches appears doubtful.
One of the final projects from the United Artists stable, inherited by Sony Classics, the film is not without wry hipster humor and moments of poignancy, but it seems legitimate to have expected more from this team. Pic's most admirable quality is its coherence with the prevailing concerns of Zwigoff's distinctive body of work. But while it again looks at how offbeat personalities fit into a blinkered mainstream culture that tends to marginalize original voices, it adds few fresh nuances to that theme.
Like "Ghost World," "Art School" was adapted from artist-writer Clowes' cult comic strip and produced by John Malkovich's Mr. Mudd outfit. The film similarly adopts an unembellished, straightforward visual style with leisurely, unobtrusive camera movement (courtesy of d.p. Jamie Anderson) and a sharp eye for color.
In the terrific kickoff reel, Jerome Platz (Minghella) reveals his desire to emulate his idol, Picasso, and become the greatest artist of the 21st century. Anxiously emerging from the hell of being a high school bully target and invisible to girls, he flees his suburban home for an East Coast art school, where transformation, he imagines, is just a brushstroke away. To the jaunty sounds of a brass band, the title sequence observes the arrival of the stoners, geeks and boho freaks who are Jerome's fellow freshmen.
While it's busy defining the many amusing types that populate the campus and observing Jerome's perplexed navigation of this new world, the comedy is on sound enough footing in its appealing, low-key way. But when it attempts to develop more concrete narrative strands, it stalls.
One central weakness is the failure to make a spate of serial killings around the campus into a real threat, or the killer's identity much of a mystery.
Another is the unsatisfactory treatment of Jerome's love interest, Audrey (Sophia Myles), an artist's model with a skeptical view of the pretentious art scene. While she seems to respond to Jerome on an impromptu date, Audrey quickly loses interest in favor of Jonah (Matt Keeslar), a preppy jock. While Jerome dismisses Jonah as an artistic zero, Audrey's infatuation with him makes her instantly a less interesting character.
Well into the proceedings, Clowes' screenplay appears finally to decide what it wants to be about -- the modishness and hypocrisy of the art world and the questionable value of study and schooling as an avenue to artistic self-expression. Having failed to impress (either as an artist or as would-be boyfriend to Audrey) through genuine talent and sensitivity, Jerome embarks on a fraudulent course. He imitates Jonah's primitive style, and when that doesn't work, he appropriates the morbidly violent work of booze-sodden failed artist Jimmy (Jim Broadbent) as his own.
Ultimately, Jerome's quest to get the girl, his search for an authentic voice and his embrace of opportunism -- not to mention the hunt for the killer and the unmasking of an undercover cop on campus -- all feel insufficiently robust to carry the film. What's left is a fragile sorta-romantic, sorta-rites-of-passage, sorta-art-world-critique comedy full of pleasing moments but short on overall satisfaction, shape or focus.
There are a number of enjoyable turns, particularly from Malkovich as a slimy, self-absorbed teacher; and from Joel David Moore as a wise-ass student. Anjelica Huston oozes poise and world-weary wisdom in a nicely observed scene as a savvy professor, while Steve Buscemi appears unbilled as Broadway Bob, the self-important proprietor of a trendy artists' eatery.
All maudlin bitterness and drunken animosity, Broadbent as always is a welcome, eccentric presence, but Jimmy's scenes with Jerome play like an underdeveloped cover version of the more affecting Seymour-Enid relationship from "Ghost World."
While Zwigoff and Clowes have a refreshingly oddball, cynical sensibility that will keep smart audiences amused, the chief element making "Art School" hang together is Minghella in his first lead role. Both disaffected and touchingly open to experience, his brooding, expressive face depicts a physically unprepossessing, flawed young man torn uneasily between the magnetic and repellant duality of a bogus world.

A curmudgeon with an active dose of social (and, perhaps, self-) disgust, Terry Zwigoff  has somehow planted his distinctively dubious sensibility on the American film scene. He may have turned R. Crumb into a character in his hit 1994 doc, yet Zwigoff himself seems a personality Crumb might have inventedthe filmmaker as marginalized, middle-aged malcontent.
Anti-careerist to the bone, the Zwigoff oeuvre includes two documentary portraits of the artist, Louie Bluie   and Crumb ; a successfully sweet and creepy teen film, Ghost World ; the programmatically rank and creepy Bad Santa ; and now the synthesizing (and creepy) manifesto Art School Confidential . Like Ghost World , Zwigoff's latest was written by cartoonist Daniel Clowes , but like Bad Santa , it seems fated to wear the warning bell of the film maudit.
Art School Confidential , which spent some time on the shelf before its less than enthusiastic Sundance premiere, isn't quite as gross as Bad Santa , but it's no less ugly and equally confrontational, not to mention a good deal funnier. (There's more than one joke.) Like the squiggly sweat beads in a Crumb cartoon, the movie radiates contempt. How could it not? The only artists Zwigoff respects, per his first movie and the aesthetic articulated by his Ghost World  surrogate, the 78 collector Seymour, are obscure bluesmen and misappreciated outsiders, like Crumb's older brother.
Consequently, Art School Confidential  is set in an expensive playpen inhabited by a gaggle of geeky fools and faux lunatic poseurs. The nominal hero, Jerome Platz  (Max Minghella ), has more naïveté than integrity. He's a shy and sensitive creature, so boring in his ambition that he aspires to be the next Picasso , so conventional in his talent that his labor-intensive naturalism is largely unappreciated by his trendy peers, and so "normal" in his desires that he develops a hopeless crush on the lovely Audrey (Sophia Myles ), the prettiest of life models.
If the Strathmore Institute  were a zoo, Jerome and Audrey would be the pandas. The resident hippo is Jerome's roommate, an obnoxiously loud film major (Ethan Suplee ) whose presence alone should have rated a Sundance audience award. Far worse than the students (and even the clueless art teacher in Ghost World ) are the pretentious losers who staff the institution: John Malkovich  plays a self-obsessed life-drawing teacher who just paints triangles ("I was one of the first"). Jack Ong  has too few scenes as a more irascible instructor, who, asked by a student how he feels about attendance, scrawls "I Don't Care" on the blackboard with such feeling that the chalk breaks. Anjelica Huston  is the most dignified pedagogue, but Jim Broadbent 's embittered derelict painter (perhaps a former faculty member), ensconced in a nearby tenement slum, is the adult figure closest to Zwigoff's heart. This really bad Santa's scenes with Jerome provide a toxic analogue to the tender relationship between Ghost World 's teenage protagonist and the forty-something 78 maven she adopts as a mentor.
Art School Confidential  is replete with humorous detailin that respect, the student art projects are particularly finebut it's the attitude that rules. Zwigoff can be as mean to his characters as Todd Solondz the dramatized painting critiques (in which everyone gets an A) rival the idiocies of the creative-writing class in Solondz's Storytelling . But where Solondz is fastidious in his filmmaking, Zwigoff is indifferentArt School Confidential  can be nearly avant-garde in its tone (deaf) shifts and spatial incoherence. And while Solondz's revulsion is cerebral, Zwigoff's is visceral. He may mock body art (along with conceptualism, minimalism, and every other '70s tendency) but his own dyspepsia suggests a kindred gut-based sensibility call it bilious, splenetic, jaundiced.
Still, Art School Confidential  does advance several theories. One, implicit in Crumb , is that art is the revenge of the nerds, as well as a means to get laid. This is spelled out in the scene wherein a successful, famous student returns to insult the entire school, as well as that in which Jerome tenderly kisses his portrait of Audrey. She'll eventually find it in the garbage and, narcissistic as she is, fall for him. By that time, however, Jerome's desperate desire to win her love has driven him to copy, steal, and worse.
Theodor Adorno  once proposed that every work of art was "an uncommitted crime." Art School Confidential  pushes that notion to the limit by introducing a subplot in which the Strathmore campus is terrorized by a serial killer. Albeit clumsy, this narrative device does enable some hilariously crass cop routines and one excellent twist. More to the point, it provides material for the avidly sensational movie being made by Jerome's opportunistic roomieand, needless to say, Zwigoff's as well.
For Zwigoff and Clowes, art is less an uncommitted crime than a miserable racket that involves multiple real offenses, including fraud. Their screed doesn't exactly add up, but then their notion of success (which turns Jerome's roomie into Kevin Smith  and Jerome himself into an objet d'art) is nearly as bleak as their notion of failureand in keeping with Zwigoff's career-long concerns, it's far more authentic.
