Cartoons have always played fast and loose with the laws of gravity, but now climatology takes a beating, too? The same characters that ushered in the Ice Age in this series� first outing are conveniently back for the thaw. Either there was another sequel lost in the mix � Manny the Mammoth Stumbles Across the Holy Grail
, perhaps? � or Ice Age: The Meltdown
�s creators just compressed roughly 50,000 years of polar ice caps to but a blip in time. Neat trick, guys. Sketchy science aside, the original gang � depressive Manny (voiced by Romano), lisping underachiever Sid the sloth (Leguizamo), and cranky tiger Diego (Leary) � is back in action, leading a sort-of animal kingdom exodus to outrun the meltdown before it drowns them all. (Newcomer Latifah costars as a lady mammoth love interest for Manny.) Scene-stealer Scrat (voiced by the original�s director, Chris Wedge) returns, too, as a half-squirrel/half-rat concoction forever foiled in his bid to reclaim an acorn, and once again, his bit part is the best thing going on here. The voice work is still tops, and a Busby Berkeley homage with preying vultures belting out �Food Glorious Food� is a fun distraction, but neither dampens the feeling that this is an exercise in the superfluous. Much of the original film�s geniality � and all of its pro-environment stumping � has gone missing; what we have instead is a watered-down likeness that curiously turns disaster flick in its too-scary third act.


If a Pixar
 movie represents the four-star cuisine of computer-generated family entertainment and DreamWorks Animation offers hip fusion meals such as "Shrek" and "Shark Tale," then the films that come out of 20th Century Fox's CGI wing -- "Ice Age," "Robots" -- are franks 'n' beans by comparison. They're comfortable and filling (if mildly gassy), and artistry isn't on the menu.
Which is to say that "Ice Age: The Meltdown" is pure sequel product that should make children and undemanding grown-ups happy even as it lacks anything resembling storytelling inspiration. Anyone inclined to take the longer view may scratch his head and wonder why a kiddie movie is the only place our culture is willing to talk about global warming.
Yep, meteorological apocalypse is the dramatic engine of "Meltdown" (are you ready for your Happy Meal?). The glaciers are retreating, oceans are breaking out everywhere, and all the baroque Pleistocene critters are rushing for the safety of a giant tree trunk "ark" before a massive ice dam bursts and floods their valley.
Amid the glyptodonts, aurochs, and giant anteaters are a few familiar faces: Manny the mammoth (voice of Ray Romano), Sid the giant sloth (John Leguizamo), and Diego the saber-toothed tiger (Denis Leary). (Unlike in the first "Ice Age," Paleolithic man is nowhere in evidence; presumably he has already made it to high ground.) These three form their own pack, although Manny is morose over the fact that he's probably the last of his kind.
Scratch that: Another mammoth appears in the form of Ellie (Queen Latifah), a high-spirited pachyderm convinced she's actually an opossum. The "ugly marsupial" subplot extends to Ellie's romping blithely through the trees with her two adopted possum brothers, Crash (Seann William Scott, who played Stifler in the "American Pie" movies) and Eddie (Josh Peck, from Nickelodeon's "Drake and Josh"). These two come on like meerkats with attention-deficit disorder and are the second-funniest things in the movie.
The funniest -- by a long shot -- is Scrat, the prehistoric squirrel whose silent, increasingly desperate attempts to retrieve a precious acorn are dropped into the movie like "Road Runner" shorts into a Cecil B. DeMille epic. Pared down to the bone of comic cause and hilarious effect, the Scrat sequences show off what mainstream CGI is capable of at its best: an unbeatable combination of hyper-realistic textures and crack Looney Tunes timing.
Elsewhere, "Ice Age: The Meltdown" plods along with the heavy familiarity of Manny himself, introducing two thawed-out aquatic beasties to nip scarily at the heels of the heroes as they encounter one near-death experience after another. The saber-toothed tiger has to overcome his fear of water. Sid has to overcome his native stupidity -- no easy task -- and cope with a worshipful horde of miniature sloths who've apparently wandered over from "Madagascar."
Manny, meanwhile, has to convince Ellie she's a mammoth for the greater good of the species, and only the geniality of Romano and Queen Latifah keep this plotline from devolving into an especially gooey episode of "The Bachelor." Along with a crowd of cameo fauna -- Jay Leno as a fast-talking tortoise, Stephen Root as an aardvark, Will Arnett of "Arrested Development" as a vulture -- they all move toward a climax of nearly biblical proportions, only to see the world saved by a tiny yet consequential act.
Well, it's a kids' movie; of course it's going to deal with climate change in a manner that's literally nuts. "Ice Age: The Meltdown" raises a gnarly topical issue only to soothe it away, and you may wonder why the filmmakers brought it up in the first place. At least the script goes easy on the overbearing pop cross-references that bogged down "Shark Tale" and "Chicken Little," and the Scrat sequences are close to genius. My kids liked the movie "better than the first one," and yours will probably play the DVD until the laser rots out of the player. That's what the studio is counting on. After the first spin, you won't even need to be in the room. After the third, neither will they.

Will Ellie, the talking animated woolly mammoth in Ice Age: The Meltdown , do for Queen Latifah what Dory, the talking animated blue fish in Finding Nemo , did for Ellen DeGeneres? It could happen. In providing the voice of a playful, full-figured gal with luscious eyelashes (maybe it's Maybelline?) and curvaceous tusks who, long story short, happens to think she's a possum, the Queen gracefully transfers her distinctive charms to one of the new principal characters who join the herd for this jaunty sequel to the popular 2002 CG family comedy. And her outgoing feminine touch sharpens the game of the boys around her  as well as the wits of the Ice Age  writers.
Ellie's arrival on the Pleistocene scene, along with her two rambunctious real-possum ''brothers'' Crash (Seann William Scott) and Eddie (Josh Peck), coincides with an emergency migration under way for the gloomy, self-aware woolly mammoth Manny (Ray Romano), the snobby saber-toothed tiger Diego (Denis Leary), and the sloth with self-esteem problems, Sid (John Leguizamo): The Ice Age is ending, the glaciers are melting, and death by drowning is a distinct possibility. (Enlightened statement about global warming? Nah, this perky escapade says life is good once you get past a little water.)
Anyhow, just as in Michael Bay's Armageddon , what's a cataclysmic world event compared with personal growth? Until he meets Ellie, Manny mopes because he thinks he's the last of his species (and even after his pals assure him that ''she completes you!'' Manny's a pessimist). Sid, looking for respect, gets more than he bargains for in some marvelous mayhem with a species of mini-sloths. Diego is forced to admit weakness. And the tenacious prehistoric squirrel-rat thing called Scrat who ran away with the first picture is back to steal the second, still obsessed with his nuts.
There will be time after Manny and Ellie rub fur to worry about the fragile planet. Ice Age: The Meltdown  blithely looks on the bright side of life, amassing a screen full of vultures to sing and dance ''Food Glorious Food'' and daring us not to get happy.

 It's the end of the Ice Age (one of them, anyway), and global warming is front and center. Not that the tots will notice: they'll be much too busy wondering if Manny (voiced drearily by Ray Romano), the woolly mammoth who lost his family in the first movie, will hook up with a cute mammoth who's convinced that she's a possum.  But in "Ice Age: The Meltdown," dissolving glaciers do more than encourage mammoths to mate. They also inspire some decidedly biblical imagery from the director, Carlos Saldanha, who herds the animals to salvation in a giant, arklike boat. Viewing it from afar, you'll swear that the structure is illuminated by a beam of light from above.  But this sequel's most visible issue is creative exhaustion. The animation is uninspired (with so much ice, the creatures need to be twice as good-looking), and the story is humdrum. (The saber-toothed tiger learns to swim!) Scrat, the squirrel-rat hybrid featured prominently in the trailers, is given an extended shtick with his still-elusive acorn — an irritating device that serves only to chop the film into tidy, bite-size sections. Science also takes a hit this time, as two massive, coelacanthlike fish are unfrozen and turn out to be twice as lively as the rest of the cast. Next time, they should have their own movie.  "Ice Age: The Meltdown" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested) for mild language and innuendo.

A tad crasser and pushier than its predecessor, "Ice Age: The Meltdown" is still an entirely serviceable follow-up to the 2002 hit that will thoroughly amuse kids and get a rise or two out of parents as well. Graced by vibrant CGI images and sly readings by the three returning top vocal thesps, Fox release looks to brighten the spotty early spring B.O. landscape by approximating the commercial potency of the original, which salted away $382 million worldwide and plenty more in ancillary afterlife.
"This global warming is killing me," an old-timer gripes, as he beholds the literal water park the previously frigid neighborhood has become. Blissfully ignorant of the climatic threat about to strike them, the happily integrated creatures live in a fool's paradise, romping and sliding and goofing around in the verdant playground that used to be an ice palace.
Lest one imagine, however, that "Meltdown" is a socially conscious propaganda piece, in a way, the opposite is true; global warming, rather than being blamed on anyone (all human characters have been eliminated this time around, so there's no one to blame), is presented as a natural phenomenon with which the planet's guests must cope.
The first to notice something's amiss is Scrat, the beleaguered rodent whose initial attempt to secure an ever-elusive nut is frustrated when he runs out of body parts to plug up holes in an increasingly bursting dam of ice. As before, the Scrat running gag reps a memorable highlight that revives an antic Chuck Jones-style comedy of frustration.
Before long, the happy campers, once again dominated by sad sack mammoth Manny (voiced by Ray Romano), mordant saber-toothed tiger Diego (Denis Leary) and dufus-y sloth Sid (John Leguizamo), realize the doomsayers are right -- the ice cliffs surrounding them won't hold much longer. To avoid the coming flood, the beasts and critters must travel three days up valley to a waiting ark.
With Manny suffering from the impression he may be the last mammoth on Earth, the ponderous journey acquires a little emotional oomph with the arrival Ellie (Queen Latifah), a mammoth convinced she's a possum, to the point that she sleeps hanging upside down by her tail from a tree. Part of her problem -- and the film's -- is she keeps incessant company with two manic possums (Seann William Scott, Josh Peck) who prove that one hyperactive character (a position already locked down by Scrat) is enough for any film. Diego demonstrably feels the same way, and one increasingly wishes he would succeed in his wish for a possum snack.
Through their journey, the wayfarers are threatened by a couple of nasty, big-toothed amphibians, and are followed by a flock of vultures, whose very clever reworking of the tune "Food Glorious Food" from "Oliver!," performed as they peer drooling down on what they hope will be their next meal, reps the musical highlight.
Style and approach of the sequel are of a piece with the original picture, on which present helmer Carlos Saldanha was co-director (to Chris Wedge, who's now exec producer). Lori Forte remains as producer. New writers Peter Gaulke, Gerry Swallow and Jim Hecht supply plenty of decent jokes that Romano, Leguizamo and Leary deliver with every bit of drollery they can summon, but there's a small new anxiety to please that differentiates the tone somewhat from the first outing. Not that the small fry will notice.

A merry saga of death, extinction, and migratory depletion, this sequel may be the grimmest entertainment for kids since Uncle Walt killed Old Yeller. Underneath the intermittently funny slapstick, there's a worldview in which everything exists to eat, be eaten, and die. Struggling to stay off the menu are Diego the saber-toothed tiger (voice of Denis Leary ), Sid the sloppily sibilant sloth (John Leguizamo ), and Manny the lonely mammoth (Ray Romano ), who head for higher ground to escape a flood. (That's as compelling as the story getsa long walk.) A romantic subplot about a possum-raised mammoth (Queen Latifah !) tries to put the warm in global warming, but the unappealing character designs, incessant celebrity-voice chatter, and slickly inexpressive 3-D animation thwart any emotional pull. The only feeling that registers is hungerthat of show-tune-singing vultures, unfrozen sea monsters, and especially the starving scene stealer called the Scrat. Watching this zoo of long-vanished quadrupeds, you're left with an eerie message for our own warming times: They fought the thaw, and the thaw won.
