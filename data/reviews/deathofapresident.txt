There is a lot of hype and hysteria surrounding this British film, because one of its plot points is the fictional assassination of President George W. Bush in 2007. Talking heads pontificate about the film's immorality without having seen a single frame of footage, a couple of theatre chains have refused to book it on their screens, and the title was condensed to the less inflammatory D.O.A.P.
 when it premiered last month at the Toronto International Film Festival. If hype can be translated into box-office dollars, then Death of a President
 could be a runaway hit. No amount of hype, however, can turn this into a terrific movie. It's more a sleight of hand than a persuasive drama. Filmed as a fake documentary, the movie uses a mix of existing news footage and dramatized sequences to present a vision of the aftermath of a presidential assassination in this post-9/11 day and age. The first half-hour is spellbinding as we witness Bush's visit to a Chicago speaking engagement, the swarm of protesters crowding the streets along the motorcade route and hotel, and the one-on-one interviews with key participants in the events � Secret Service agents, a speechwriter, family members of the accused, and so on, all played by actors behaving as though they're speaking to a documentary camera. Technically, the movie is flawless: Footage is interwoven so seamlessly and chosen so precisely that the illusion of reality is never in question. Range's movie then gradually falters as the focus turns to the aftermath rather than the assassination itself. The new President Dick Cheney instructs the agents to look for a Syrian, and they do, while ignoring other leads. The PATRIOT Act III is passed into law as Americans sheepishly accept their new reality. Range does not prove especially shrewd about American racial politics or police procedurals, and Death of a President
 quickly grows more and more implausible as a result. Dramatic escalation falls by the wayside and gives way to political axe-grinding. By the end, there's nothing to admire except Range's technical virtuosity.


All right, everybody take a deep breath. "Death of a President," the British faux-documentary that's a four-alarm scandal only to those who haven't seen it, opens today -- and turns out to be rather less than the sum of its headlines.
Let's get to the nub of the matter. Directed by Gabriel Range and written by him with Simon Finch , "Death" imagines the late 2007 assassination of George W. Bush primarily as a means to examine the political aftermath -- a clampdown on civil liberties and a desperate search for the gunman that coughs up a convenient Arab Muslim suspect who happens to be innocent.
Meanwhile, the real killer is closer to home while still tied to our adventures abroad. Far from envisioning conspiracies, "Death" sees the assassination as a case of damaged chickens coming home to roost and the government's response as extreme and very scared. As what-if scenarios go, it's not completely preposterous.
But is it exploitive? "Death" bends over backward to not
 play the title tragedy for sensationalism, which obviously won't matter if you find the very idea seditious. The first third of the film is set in Chicago, as Bush arrives for a speech to business leaders. The clips we see are repurposed from existing news footage, but the mob of angry activists outside the hotel appears to have been staged by Range. The speech Bush delivers is one he actually gave in Chicago on Jan. 7, 2003, and he comes off well: affable, articulate, sympathetic.
Range then brings Bush out of the hotel (using a brief shot of an actor with the president's face digitally superimposed on his head) , and as "filmed" by a news camera across the street, there is a muffled shot, a confusing flurry of motion, and the ambulances are off to the hospital. A nation mourns, President Dick Cheney is seen giving a eulogy (actually, it's the one he delivered at Ronald Reagan's funeral), and "Death" sets about its main order of business.
Which is to imply that the sitting government of the United States is so hamstrung by ideology, so rigid in its global intentions, that it refuses to see the truth of the tragedy even when the evidence becomes overwhelming. "Death of a President" says that George W. Bush is a convenient, electable sock-puppet for the true architects of his administration but that they'd easily carry on without him and even use his death to tighten their grip. Personally, if I were president, I might find the notion that I'm completely disposable more insulting than imagined assassination.
Range stages "interviews" with ersatz Secret Service agents, policy makers, and relatives of the various accused to cook up a vision of a willfully blind government rushing to judgment. You can debate from here to the next election whether such media manipulation is irresponsible -- given that the film has a case to make but not an ax to grind keeps the intentions reasonably honorable -- but the blunt fact is that "Death of a President" just isn't very good at the fakery.
The "interviewees" feel like actors, the crowd scenes feel underpopulated, the imitation New York Times
 headlines are patently sham. The whole film has the whiff of a low-cost documentary unspooling on a basic cable channel on Sunday afternoon when you should be out raking leaves. Above all, it's a movie about America that doesn't feel American, in the same indefinable way British actors never quite get our local accents right. Ironically, "Death" is kept from both treason and credibility by its own inability to convince.
A further irony is that other documentaries, real
 documentaries, exist that more damningly depict the government's mistreatment of accused prisoners (Michael Winterbottom 's semi-docu "The Road to Guantanamo" ) and the psychological damage wreaked upon both US soldiers (Patricia Foulkrod 's "The Ground Truth" ) and the people of Iraq (James Longley 's upcoming "Iraq in Fragments" ).
"Death of a President," by contrast, never escapes a fundamental naivete in style and content, most notably in establishing an inflammatory premise that it's too studious or timid to subsequently address. You could say the film lacks the courage of its own tastelessness. Or you could say that truth is stranger -- more barbed, less forgiving -- than metafiction.


         Gabriel Range's "Death of a President," a potato so hot the Toronto Film Festival's schedule referred to the movie only by its initials until a week before its premiere, has been so well and thoroughly flamed since September that it lands in theaters this week obscured in smoke. Somewhere within this smoldering heap of controversy is a technically inventive, thoughtful, but otherwise not particularly earth-shattering movie that imagines what would happen if the president of the United States were assassinated — a hypothetical event it presents as calamitous.
 
  Far from an endorsement of violence, "Death of a President," which was the winner of the International Critics Prize at Toronto, is a fairly simplistic, definitely tendentious but levelheaded call for reason on all sides. It warns of the pernicious effects of rush to judgment and thoughtless reaction, especially during times of high anxiety. All of this is well and good, except that the insertion of real events and real people into a hypothetical scenario puts the burden of believability on the hypotheses — which are truthy but speculative.
 


         






    Skillfully — though not entirely seamlessly — the movie blends news footage with staged street scenes, fake surveillance footage and made-up talking head interviews, as well as footage from actual antiwar demonstrations and what appears to be Ronald Reagan's funeral. From this, "Death of a President" extrapolates a scarier, but not unrecognizable, future from an already scary enough present. On a visit to Chicago to address a business association, the president is met by an unusually hostile mob of demonstrators, who breach security barriers and rush the motorcade. That evening, he is shot by a sniper as he greets supporters on the sidewalk , and dies. An isolated violent incident, it unleashes a chain reaction that gives us Dick Cheney as commander in chief, brings us to the brink of war with Syria and introduces the all-new, extra-draconian Patriot Act III.
 
  It's presumably because the film makes Bush into a character and imagines that character killed — rather than, say, having cast Harrison Ford as a fictional president (although, clearly, this would strain credulity; what director in his right mind would kill off Ford in the first act?) — that inspired AMC Loews, Cinemark and Regal Entertainment Group — major chains not ordinarily in the habit of showing tiny independent films made for British TV — to decline publicly to show it. CNN and NPR have also refused to run ads or sponsorship messages, citing the "extreme nature of the subject matter." You have to admire the cosmic irony of a movie about political grandstanding and media timidity that becomes in itself an opportunity for grandstanding and timidity, because the alternative would involve piteous weeping. Like so many flashy art and media controversies in recent years — the dread "Nipplegate" comes to mind, wherein a lone breast flung open the gates to a cavalcade of reactionary clampdowns, some scary, some sublimely absurd — "Death of a President" provides a soapbox big enough to accommodate a crowd, and the fear of appearing to sympathize with a sentiment the film does not express keeps people scrambling to climb aboard. What's sacrificed in the process is critical thinking and faith in people's capacity to engage in it. What's the purpose of fiction, anyway, except to interpret events in an attempt to extract meaning from the chaos of life? Whether or not you agree with the interpretation is up to you — provided someone doesn't try to shield your eyes from it like Mom did when passing a car accident.
 
  The decision to use stock footage of Bush is clearly manipulative, and it works. The tension and dread achieved here owes almost everything to its uncomfortable proximity to reality. But presenting him as a character in a larger drama is also effective in unexpected ways: It's rare to see the president as a human being at the center of a volatile situation. Far from the villain of the piece, Bush is portrayed as a tragic victim of circumstance — or at least a tragic lesser of two evils.
 
  That's not to say that you would ever walk away from this film with the impression that the filmmakers put much stock in the rampant POTUS infatuation of his fictional inner circle, speechwriter Ellie Drake (Becky Ann Baker) and head of the presidential security detail, Larry Stafford (Brian Boland). It's perfectly clear that the film is critical of the administration's policies, and places them above the human element. But the protesters' unhinged hatred for the president as a leader comes across as tense and unnerving as interviews with fictional staff members.
 
  Observing the unfurling of events from a more dispassionate point of view are a journalist, former White House correspondent Sam McCarthy (Jay Patterson), and a scientist, forensic investigator Dr. James Pearn (James Urbaniak), who watch as facts become distorted to suit political agendas. In the rush to find a culprit, a Syrian computer engineer, Jamal Abu Zikri (Malik Bader), is apprehended and charged based on weak forensic evidence. Meanwhile, another, less politically viable culprit emerges, but strong evidence against him is swept under the rug for the sake of political expediency.
 
  Certainly, "Death of a President" is not the first or the last movie to suggest that the Bush administration's policies in the war on terror have had a corrosive effect on civil liberties. What makes it interesting is that it tries to break down the events it presents into individual human experience, to show how easily these can coalesce into one unholy mess. The movie manipulates reality to show how easily reality can be manipulated. "Death of a President" is one of two films out this week (the other is Alejandro González Iñárritu's "Babel") that comment on the issue of media distortion of real events — how easily it comes, how quickly it's forgotten, how insidiously it shapes our perceptions.
 
  What the movie really wants to talk about are the unintended consequences of rash actions, whether by an individual, a corporation or a nation. OK, but tell us something we don't know. Eerie, tense and immediate as "Death of a President" looks and feels, it doesn't contribute much of anything new to the discourse.
 
  Then again, some of the points it makes bear repeating. Which brings up an interesting question — why is it fake travesties rile us so much more than real ones?

When I first heard about Death of a President , a fake documentary that depicts the assassination of George W. Bush, I assumed that it would be a fashionably irresponsible piece of demagogic leftist wish-fulfillment, a righteous political harangue posing as reality. Actually, it's more somber and tangled and ingenious than that. The movie is  a provocation, but not a glib or ideologically myopic one. It strikes the urgent, open-eyed tone of a Frontline  investigative report, interspersing video-surveillance footage with talking-head testimony from (fictional) U.S. officials and Secret Service agents  and, in the film's most startling and resonant trick, assembling the heart of its staged reality out of actual news footage.
Early on, there are clips of demonstrators who line the streets chanting ''Chicago hates Bush!'' as the narrator describes a mood of despair that has fermented into chaos and collective fury. Death of a President  hits the zeitgeist jackpot; it roots itself in an all too timely mood of souring national rage. The movie, which begins in 2007, shows us President Bush arriving at the airport and addressing the partisan Economic Club of Chicago in a jokey speech that touches on North Korea's nuclear ambitions, then joining a crowd of participants for an informal rope-line meet and greet. The director, Gabriel Range, who has made a number of dramas in documentary form for British television, forges a grainy, newsreel, believe-your-eyes verisimilitude, a technique that works stunningly well right up through the assassination, in which a flash of blood and a subliminal glimpse of the president's crumpling body evoke both the dawn-of-the-media-age horror of the shooting of Lee Harvey Oswald and the attempted assassination of President Reagan. A jolting close-up of Dick Cheney as he delivers Bush's eulogy in eerily precise detail will make you wonder how the filmmakers brought it off. (They used a clip of Cheney from Reagan's funeral, digitally fudging a few words.)
The film's atmosphere of plausibility is its most devious trick: If we believe Death of a President  as we're watching it, then we implicitly buy the assassination of George Bush not as a far-fetched crackpot dream but as an act that could literally emerge from the collision of these crowds, this president. Even if you think of yourself as a proud Bush basher, you may be surprised at how the prospect of political homicide makes you recoil, makes you want to see the president protected.
In its second half, as it traces the hunt for the killer, Death of a President  becomes a whodunit that is also a cautionary tract. Eager to fold the calamity into its war on terror, the government pins the assassination on a Syrian national who is clearly innocent. If that sounds like a didactic thesis, it is. Yet even as it sketches in a national clampdown that is observationally and satirically rather humdrum (ratcheting up the Patriot Act, etc.), the movie makes you realize just how much we now accept in this country as business as usual. Death of a President  begins as a disturbingly  clever stunt but concludes as a contradiction, a political nightmare of haunting banality.

 Since it was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, “The Death of a President,” a formally clever fake-umentary directed by Gabriel Range, has attracted some fairly predictable controversy. Since the president in question is George W. Bush and the death is the result of an assassination, the film has become a lightning rod for the usual forms of self-righteousness that often masquerade as political discussion. On one side, howls of “How dare you?” and on the other, ringing endorsements of free expression and artistic courage.  But “The Death of a President” doesn’t really deserve either response, even though its makers and distributors will no doubt be happy to exploit the brouhaha. The best that can be said about Mr. Range’s opportunistic little picture is that, at least in its first half, it faithfully recreates the tone and rhythm of a second-rate American television program.  For a while, this is actually pretty riveting. The film pretends to be a look back at the events of Oct. 19, 2007, when Mr. Bush was shot and killed after delivering a speech in Chicago. After-the-fact interviews with witnesses and participants — a Secret Service agent, a presidential aide, various members of the F.B.I. and the Chicago Police Department (all actors, of course) — alternate with hand-held video, security-camera feeds and mock news clips to recreate the chaos of the event. Snippets of an actual speech Mr. Bush gave to the Economic Club of Chicago are used, and later on Ronald Reagan’s funeral is used as a stand-in for Mr. Bush’s.  In a few places Mr. Range’s ingenuity exceeds his skill, but he does sometimes achieve a hectic, nerve-racking realism. The president’s motorcade makes its way through an angry throng of protesters, some of whom scuffle with police and one of whom, a radical anarchist, will later become a suspect. Then, after the fatal shots are fired, consequences start to unfold: a frenzied investigation leading to an arrest, a new version of the Patriot Act, rumbles of war-talk if a foreign government turns out to be involved.  The real phoniness of “Death of a President” lies not in its counterfeiting of reality — the procedural details have a certain plausibility — but in its facile, melodramatic manipulation of current political anxieties. The extent to which its flat, documentary style is a manipulation becomes clear as its plot starts to follow the contours of a “Law & Order” episode.  Some will find profundity in the film’s reversals and revelations, but its provocations are not particularly insightful or original. “The Death of a President” is, in the end, neither terribly outrageous nor  especially heroic; it’s a thought experiment that traffics in received ideas.  “The Death of a President” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has violence and strong language.

Inflammatory more on a conceptual level than for the ideas it actually advances, the skillful docudrama "Death of a President" uses an imagined assassination of George W. Bush a year hence to explore how the American government might react to such an event and to post warning signs about the dangers of a rush to judgment in a climate all too conducive to instant finger-pointing. Shrewdly blending archival footage with staged material in ways that raise a host of separate issues, pic is calculatingly controversial on the face of things, designed to provoke gobs of media coverage and automatic outrage from those who haven't seen it. Such attention should assure theatrical release in key territories, although best prospects lie in cable (at least in the U.S.) and homevid.
From the very first moments, in which an Arabic-speaking woman bemoans the assassin's act and asks, "Why didn't he think about the consequences of his actions?," it is firmly suggested that this is not a film that advocates the killing of Bush. Assembled soberly and credibly in the style of a TV history docu about the event made well after the fact, the picture spends its first half recounting the day--October 19, 2007--leading up to the president's shooting in front of a Chicago hotel, and the second analyzing the search for suspects and the hasty push for justice.
English director and co-writer Gabriel Range knows his way around the docu style and the manipulation of footage for his own alarmist purposes, having three years ago made "The Day Britain Stopped," another speculative piece about the collapse of the country's transportation grid and its calamitous result. Range is on a path to becoming the intellectual Irwin Allen, a disaster specialist working in the brainy realm of faux analytical documentaries, a mini-genre arguably initiated by Peter Watkins more than four decades ago with "The War Game."
Layering the sense of dread with measured expertise, Range does a formidable job visualizing the circumstances surrounding the crime. As insights are offered key personnel--secret service agents, police, the president's speech writer, an activist and many others, all believably impersonated by actors--TV news-type coverage documents Bush's arrival in Chicago, the arrival of his motorcade into the midst of a hugely unruly demonstration featuring 12,000 protestors and the president's speech to a group of the city's economic leaders (a real event here used fictionally).
The demonstration scenes, evidently staged on the streets of Chicago especially for the film, are amazingly realistic and rep the film's high point in terms of vivid docudrama filmmaking. Many of the protestors have a feral, savage horde quality quite unlike their counterparts in the most famous film to have documented real-life Chicago political street battles, Haskell Wexler's "Medium Cool," and their burst beyond proscribed barriers and the resulting surge of police resemble frightening natural eruptions.
Despite the misgivings of the main secret service man, Bush insists upon walking the rope line on the way out of the hotel, which is where he's hit by two bullets from an unseen source. The president is pushed into his limo and rushed to Northwestern Hospital as hysteria ensues. This key sequence, which comes 25 minutes in, could have been presented gruesomely and exploitatively but is not; Bush's face, grafted in digitally, is fleetingly seen, but there's no impact or slow motion and it all happens in a flurry.
Then there's the waiting period, during which time authorities hurriedly assess where the shots may have come from and search for suspects. It's quickly determined that the shooter was positioned on the twentieth floor of the building across the street. A rifle is found, video surveillance footage is examined and numerous men are rounded up.
Soon after the president expires from his wounds, at pic's midway point, a certain Jamal Abu Zikri is arrested, his name leaked to the media with suspicious speed. Employed in the building across the street, Zikri is Syrian and, although he initially denies it, formerly served in that country's army. Once it's learned he also associated with a rabble-rousing Muslim cleric in the Chicago projects and traveled to Pakistan and Afghanistan, everyone's satisfied that Zikri's the man they want.
Pressure is ratcheted up on Syria, and President Cheney quickly pushes through Patriot Act III, which gives the government further powers to fight terrorism domestically. Perhaps the film's most remarkable--or dubious, depending upon one's perspective--sequence in one in which Cheney is seen to be presiding over his predecessor's state funeral, extolling his greatness to the distinguished assembly. One actually sees Cheney himself standing before a flag-bedraped casket at just such a funereal, and one can only presume that what we hear are ingeniously edited excerpts from a speech he gave in honor of a recently deceased government luminary.
After the elaborate set-up, the film curiously narrows in the last stretch devoted to Kikri's trial and related events. Far too much time is given over to forensic evidence, and when a possible alternative shooter comes into view, the concerns of the film are reduced nearly to those of a standard-issue murder mystery.
The film implicitly links the "conveyor belt" process by which Kikri has been charged, tried and convicted to the assumptions portrayed as truth by the Bush Administration and many others that led to the Iraq invasion, the almost automatic linking of Al-Qaeda to every terrorist incident and so on. It's this change of mindset, the instant associations that now connect to anything Islamic or that might be perceived as threatening the United States, that are the film's chief subjects. It's a point of view very much at odds with the administration line, but the argument is presented in a non-hysterical way that invites debate.
Disappointingly, "Death of a President" shrinks from its promise as a piece of genuinely radical or adventurous speculative fiction. For a while, the film references world events that parallel the domestic tragedy, such as flare-ups concerning North Korea and the challenge to Syria. Final section jumps seven months ahead, or to May, 2008, offering the possibility of mentioning such pertinent matters as a Cheney run for reelection, a widening of the Middle East conflict and further U.S. muscle flexing. But there's nothing of the sort. By concentrating solely on the details of the crime, the filmmakers deny themselves the greatest visionary possibilities offered by their premise.
The film also raises provocative questions as to the ethics of doctoring real footage to fictional or ideological ends, as well as to the responsibility of even presenting such heinous potential crimes in the context of would-be popular entertainment and thus possibly putting ideas into the heads of the easily suggestible. All this provides plenty of fodder for pontification by cultural commentators.
Technically, the film is exceptional.

Manufactured history guarantees a manufactured controversy: Gabriel Range 's Death of a President , which docudramatizes the 2007 assassination of George W. Bush , has been preceded by a long, raucous fanfare.
Excoriated on talk radio, damned as a snuff film, banned by two theater chains, the British production has also garnered celebrity dis-endorsements. It was criticized unseen by assassination movie veteran Kevin Costner  ("We can't, like, wish . . . ") and denounced (also unseen) by Hillary Clinton : "That anyone would even attempt to profit on such a horrible scenario makes me sick."
Is Death of a President  more exploitative than JFK ? (That  was a snuff film.) And didn't Fox turn a buck on Independence Day , which jovially incinerated the White House  when Mrs. Clinton was actually living there? The difference is lése-majesté: Death of a President  presents the "real" Bush in a fictional situation. (It's the opposite of the egregious telefilm DC 9/11: Time of Crisis , which featured a fictional Bush.)
Dramatically inert but a minor techno-miracle, Range's movie is a faux documentary with fake talking heads and seamless digital effects. Invented characters are gumped into actual news events and vice versa. The editing and audio sleight of hand are nearly as impressive. Range, who previously "documented" the collapse of British transport, used actual Chicago street protests to provide the illusion of crowds breaking police barriers to mob the presidential limo. But that's not the money shot: The assassination occurs when, leaving the Sheraton , supposedly surrounded by 12,000 flag-burning demonstrators, the president elects to work the rope line.
Death of a President 's method and location recall Haskell Wexler 's Medium Cool , which staged a fictional story against the chaotic backdrop of the 1968 Democratic convention . But Range skews more theoretical than sensationalistand if he's celebratory, it's not in the way Rush Limbaugh  imagines. Bush is presented as a martyr. (Appropriately, the movie is distributed by the company that released The Passion of the Christ .) Range may be overcompensating, but he has the slain president praised throughout by adoring staffers and mealymouthed acolytes; even at the hospital, a functionary tells the press the chief surgeon has "never seen such a strong heart in a man of the president's age." The obvious reference is Ronald Reagan . If the attempt on Reagan's life offers Range a dramatic template, the mass amnesia occasioned by Reagan's funeral is far more crucialand not just because it provides Dick Cheney 's eulogy.
Bush is but a special effect. Death of a President  is really a movie about 9-11an essay on a national tragedy used to create an even greater tragedy. (That's the scenario that really should have made Senator Clinton "sick.") It's also a movie about itselfa demonstration of reality shaped to fit a particular hypothesis. There doesn't seem to be any irony there. Range saves that for the investigation. The system is flooded with detainees while, in the matter of suspects, use value trumps truth. President Cheney suggests that his security adviser "take another look" at Syria . The infinite elasticity of "national security" enables a new Patriot Act  to trample the Bill of Rights. But Death of a President 's warning about blowback has its own unintended consequences: What follows the assassination is so awful that anyone might be excused for leaving the theater convinced of the urgent need to keep Bush alive.
The world was awash in cinema vérité 40 years ago, when British maverick Peter Watkins  more or less invented the faux documentary with The War Game . He's been refining the form ever since, but Death of a President  has nowhere near Watkins's agitational fervor. (Or his critical intelligence: Even if you believe that Bush is the worst president in history, it matters not whether he is impeached, falls from his bicycle, or gets raptured to heaventhe damage has been done.) Death of a President  is ultimately just an exercise. There's a far more subversive political mock-umentary coming next week. I invite President Bush, Senator Clinton, and all politicians to get down with Borat.
