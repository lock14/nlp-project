         Director Susanne Bier mainlines emotion. She has a connection to feelings and passions that is as direct and potent as an addict's needle piercing a vein. Her fierce and compelling dramas, like the new "After the Wedding," serve it up straight, no chaser, and dare anyone to flinch.
 
 Though she's been directing in Denmark since 1990, Bier only entered U.S. film consciousness with her previous two films: "Open Hearts" and 2004's wrenching drama of war's aftermath, "Brothers," which took the audience award for world cinema at Sundance. "After the Wedding" has been her most successful, getting nominated for two European Film Awards including best director, and making the cut in a highly competitive year as one of the five Oscar nominees for best foreign-language film.
 
 


         






   FOR THE RECORD:

  "After the Wedding": The review of the movie "After the Wedding" in Friday's Calendar section said Susanne Bier had been directing in Sweden since 1990. She has been directing in Denmark. The review also referred to actor Mads Mikkelsen as having appeared in small Swedish films such as "Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself." The reference should have been to Danish films. Also the print edition of this story misidentified director Susanne Bier as Swedish.—

 
 

 
 Like all Bier's work, "After the Wedding"  is frankly a melodrama, a film where the emotions are huge and the coincidences larger still. But more important, it's that paradoxical melodrama that point-blank refuses to acknowledge that it's being melodramatic, conveying its scenario with enough intensity, psychological acuity and forceful acting to ignore labels and flat-out overpower audiences.
 
 "After the Wedding," written by the veteran Anders Thomas Jensen, stars the gifted, charismatic Mads Mikkelsen, whose career has gone from small Danish films like "Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself" to big budget international villainy as the ice cold Le Chiffre in the recent James Bond movie "Casino Royale."
 
 Mikkelsen plays Jacob, introduced not in Denmark but in India, where he manages an orphanage and a food aid program and serves as a surrogate father to a winsome 8-year-old orphan named Pramod.
 
 Even before the opening credits have finished, Jacob is presented with what he considers the most painful of dilemmas. A billionaire Danish businessman has offered to donate a sum of money without which the orphanage cannot stay open. But before he does so the man insists that Jacob return to Denmark and meet him, a condition which Jacob, who despises rich people and doesn't want to miss Pramod's upcoming birthday party, feels is particularly onerous.
 
 Yet, though nothing is said, the feeling is inescapable that more than this is going on. Though he is devoted to his work to an almost Jesuitical extent, Jacob has the air of God's angry man, someone who has unfinished, unanalyzed personal business somewhere in his history. Going back to Denmark, even for a visit, is clearly the last thing he wants to do.
 
 Once the decision to go is forced on him, "After the Wedding" switches to Denmark, where billionaire Jorgen (Rolf Lassgard) and his wife, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen), are preparing to marry off their daughter Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen).
 
 By casting heavyset Swedish actor Lassgard as Jorgen, director Bier has chosen to present him, at least physically, as the classically bluff, overbearing captain of industry. But though he looks crass and crude, "After the Wedding" takes pains to introduce Jorgen en famille, so to speak, to show him engagingly reading bedtime stories to his young twin sons, enjoying the company of his wife, even bemusedly tolerating his aged mother. Yes, he's pleased with himself, and why not?
 
 When Jorgen and Jacob meet, the businessman announces that his mind is not made up yet about where to put his money. He needs a few days to decide and, in the interim, he insists that Jacob attend his daughter's wedding the next day. The antisocial Jacob would prefer not to, but Jorgen insists.
 
 Because Bier's film is called "After the Wedding," it's giving nothing away to say that something happens at the wedding that is so confounding it would be the climax of another film, but here it is only the very beginning of the story. What transpires upends everyone's world and reopens all kinds of old wounds, even ones that the injured didn't know they had.
 
 As noted, unstinting acting across the board is crucial in making the film's melodramatic elements convincing. A director who has said "I have a very strong ability to empathize, to understand what things feel like," Bier is expert at creating the kind of atmosphere that enables actors to throw themselves into some truly difficult scenes. If the performers believe that this is real, if they can play situations as if they were truly life and death, who are we to argue?
 
 In fact, "After the Wedding" is so adroit at using seemingly unreal situations as a conduit for inescapably real emotions, it underlines how useful melodrama can be for exploring universal dilemmas. Questions of responsibility haunt this film, questions of both the need and the cost of abandoning and connecting to other human beings. Who needs our help, finally, and who do we have to be to be able to give it?
 
 "After the Wedding" would never pretend to have any answers, but in hands this skilled the act of exploration itself couldn't be more illuminating, or more dramatic.

Masculine complexity is what Mads Mikkelsen was famous for long before he wept blood in Casino Royale . In After the Wedding , he plays a Danish orphanage worker in India, summoned home to receive a large donation  with considerable strings  from a benefactor (Rolf Lassgard) married to a beauty (Sidse Babett Knudsen) with a complicated past. Talented filmmaker Susanne Bier (Brothers ), armed with an outstanding compositional sense, keeps control over the storms of melodrama that swirl in this rich weepie, a 2006 Oscar nominee for Best Foreign Language Film.

 In “After the Wedding,” a Danish drama about ideals and money, sanctimony and obligation, bodies ricochet off one another like pinballs. Shot in digital video with a skittish, at times urgent freehand, the movie opens in India, where slender adults and scrambling children often fill every inch of the frame amid whorls of color and noise. Later, when the story moves to Denmark, where the bodies are paler and more spatially separated, the chaos of the street will have been replaced by the din of selfish human desire.  The plot involves an aid worker, Jacob, played by the eloquently unhappy-looking Mads Mikkelsen, who reluctantly returns to his native Denmark from Mumbai, where he helps run an orphanage. Home to throwaways with dusty feet and solemn smiles, the orphanage is in danger of closing for lack of funds when Jacob receives news of a possible patron. The catch, he glumly learns, is that he has to visit the homeland he left 20 years earlier and to which he has never returned. And so,  to Copenhagen he goes, reeled back by a rich man, Jorgen (the jowly, growling Rolf Lassgard, by turns seductive and horrifying), with a beautiful family, a difficult story and a sense of entitlement as absolute as that of a king.  Dressed in a cheap suit that hangs off him like a tablecloth, Jacob meets his Danish billionaire, who floats a promise worth millions in funds and tenders an invitation to attend  his daughter’s wedding. Jacob reluctantly and somewhat uncomfortably agrees. At the wedding, an expensive affair with a big white tent and a crowd of ruddy celebrants, he is surprised to meet an old acquaintance, Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen), who happens to be Jorgen’s wife. There is the beloved daughter too, Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen), who is marrying one of her father’s employees and eager admirers, Christian (Christian Tafdrup), not quite realizing that this smiling young man would as soon marry the old man as her. Every court has its courtiers and every family its complications.  Directed by Susanne Bier, whose previous features include “Open Hearts” and “Brothers,” “After the Wedding” is a modern creation  with a classic theme involving haves and have-nots, bloodlines and family ties. The whiff of the modern comes from the harmonious synchronization of the kinetic camerawork with the abrupt editing patterns, which will be familiar to anyone who has ever watched a Dogme film. Ms. Bier doesn’t adhere to all of Dogme’s tenets — found in its so-called vow of chastity — which exclude, among other things, any music or props not originating at the filmmaking site. Instead she opts for a style that might be called Dogme-lite, which mimics the movement’s visual tropes but eschews its ethos and formal rigor to create what is, at core, canned realism.  Despite the whooshing camera work, the crashing edits and the hairpin turns in Anders Thomas Jensen’s screenplay, “After the Wedding” relies on whipped-up familiar ingredients — a birth, a death, a wedding, a funeral, a man, a woman, another man, another woman — to pique the audience’s interest rather than rock its world. That makes it a fine and, on a scene-by-scene basis, often better than fine, if effectively unadventurous work, in which a man’s anguished cry is met by a finale designed to ease the pain. As in many Danish films the performers are top-flight, in particular Mr. Lassgard and Mr. Mikkelsen, an otherworldly screen presence perhaps best known outside Denmark as the villain who weeps blood while giving the lash to James Bond in “Casino Royale.” The tears only look more real here.  “After the Wedding” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). There is some adult language and coitus interruptus. 
A reformist disciple of Dogme, that earth- and camcorder-shaking movement wherein waves are broken and celebration is cause for alarm, Danish director Susanne Bier  makes what you'd call emotional disaster movies. Her Open Hearts  and Brothers , melodramas at once feverishly pitched and finely tuned, deploy paralysis and war, respectively, to test their characters' will to liveand their viewers' ability to suspend disbelief. Like Lars von Trier 's early exercises in DV soap opera, Bier's films toy with the handheld camera, in particular with its capacity to keep Hollywood -style contrivance somewhat grounded in reality. Open Hearts  (read open  as a verb) practically issues an audience command: Believe that the fiancée of a man crippled in a car crash would fall in love with the husband of the woman who caused the accident! No? Would you believe it if the movie itselfblurry, pixilated, colors bleedinglooked as though it had been pulled from the wreckage?
Digital video is much sharper now than it was in 2001. But Bier has nonetheless capped her trauma trilogy with After the Wedding , which has less to do with a terrorizing eventa bad breakup, in this casethan with that event's collateral damage, namely trust. Still licking his poor heart's wounds after 20 years, Jacob (Mads Mikkelsen ) works at an orphanage in Bombay  and vows never to return to Copenhagen , scene of the romantic crime. Muscular, oddly handsome, funny, patient, and adoring of children, Jacob is introduced scooping rice for hordes of young Indian kids with their arms outstretched. Will we ever learn what kind of woman would dream of dumping this veritable saint?
Coincidence, the mistress of melodrama, comes calling: Jacob gets an invitation from a Danish CEO to apply for charitable funds that could get his orphanage the supplies it sorely needs, but only on condition that he fly to Copenhagen for a personal meeting. Reluctantly accepting, Jacob soon comes face to face with Helene (Sidse Babett Knudsen), his former lover, discovering at her daughter's wedding that she's now the wife of his potential benefactor, zillionaire Jorgen (Rolf Lassg ). Then he learns that the daughter, 20-year-old Anna (Stine Fischer Christensen ), isn't a blood relative of the businessmanthat she never knew her real father. Just coincidence, is it? Even paranoids have enemies, and Jacob doesn't hesitate to consider that he's been set up for some sort of emotional blackmail, Jorgen's secret plot implying that Bier and Dogme-vet scenarist Anders Thomas Jensen  aren't the only ones who get off on manipulation. Indeed, one of the many smart things about After the Wedding  is how shrewdly it suggests a higher power than screenwriting.
Playing God, on one side of the camera or another, is the essence of Dogme. What happens after the wedding comprises a full three-quarters of Bier's epic, whose near-Biblical twists and turnsI wouldn't think of giving them awayare enough to fill four weepies. As before, the director dares you to deem her work absurd; here, she also forces us to acknowledge that we wouldn't blindly trust a movie's good Samaritanism any more than Jacob would believe in pennies from heaven. And no wonder: We've all been burned. Bier teases us by fluctuating Jorgen's reliability: Bulky and commanding in a way that only old money allows, Jorgen too, adores kids, but he has every creature's head stuffed and mounted on the blood-red living room wall of his country estate. And that naturally startles Jacob, whose skeptical, bruised-looking eyes (Mikkelsen wept crimson tears as Le Chiffre in Casino Royale ) are the focus of many extreme close-ups. Bier has quite an eye herself: Like Douglas Sirk  reborn as a digital neorealist, the director defies her talky genre by investing energy and genuine invention in almost every shot. For a filmmaker who's so attracted to psychological discomfort, Bier has a disarming affinity with the pleasure principle. In this she's further blessed to have cast the riveting Mikkelsen, who here displays the self-conscious jitter of the young Pacino.
No surprise that Bier is Hollywood bound. Both Brothers  and Open Hearts  are being remade, the latter by Zach Braff ; Bier's English-language debut, already in the can, is a DreamWorks  production with Halle Berry  and Benicio Del Toro . As it does for Jacob, opportunity knocks. If this prodigiously gifted director were filming her career, the moviecall it After the Crash would be about whether we can count on American dreamworkers not to turn her into Paul Haggis .
