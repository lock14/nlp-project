         Pierre Salvadori's "Après Vous" is a romantic comedy in the classic French tradition, which means that Salvadori always takes emotions seriously no matter how abundant the laughter he inspires.
 
  This delightfully spirited film is perfectly cast, and it's hard to imagine how Daniel Auteuil, José Garcia and Sandrine Kiberlain could possibly improve upon their irresistible, multifaceted portrayals. At 110 minutes, the film is arguably overlong for its genre, yet Salvadori, in developing an idea contributed by Danièle Dubroux, uses his substantial running time wisely, allowing the arcs of his engaging characters to come full circle.
 


         






    Auteuil's Antoine is the seasoned headwaiter at an elegant Paris restaurant. Not only is he an invaluable employee, but he's also a good-hearted man quick to solve other people's problems. His dedication has already made him late for a dinner date with his live-in lover, Christine (Marilyne Canto), when, while taking a short cut through a park, he witnesses a young man, Louis (Garcia), attempting to hang himself. The instant Antoine saves Louis' life he immediately starts carrying the creed of being "my brother's keeper" to hilarious extremes.
 
  Louis is a big, solidly built teddy bear of a man with a boyish face and dark moist eyes — and the very embodiment of emotional immaturity. His girlfriend, Blanche (Kiberlain), has left him, and his self-pity is so complete that only Antoine could have a prayer of pulling him out of his misery — and not surprisingly at often comic but also real cost to Antoine's own happiness and security.
 
  Gradually, Antoine comes to believe that only his tracking down Blanche and effecting a reconciliation between the two will truly restore Louis. But when Antoine finally succeeds in locating Blanche, who is running a flower shop not far from the restaurant, he is not prepared to find himself attracted to this exquisite young woman. Not helping matters for Antoine is Blanche's adamant refusal to have anything to do with Louis.
 
  The versatile Auteuil has long been the premier actor of his generation in the French cinema, and his Antoine remains endearing even at his most foolishly self-sacrificing. By the same token, Garcia's Louis is such an innocent through and through that even at his most infuriating it would be hard to reject him out of hand.
 
  In recent years, Kiberlain has stood out in numerous featured parts, but here she comes across as a full-fledged leading lady, an aristocratic beauty and an altogether lovely, distinctive screen presence.
 
  A most satisfying diversion, "Après Vous" is a graceful, witty film rich in winning portrayals, with fluid cinematography and an aptly jaunty score.

Auteur theorists are excused from any discussion of Après Vous , a throwback populist French romantic comedy directed by Pierre Salvadori with the anti-elitist (and anti-psychiatric) élan to suggest that any suicidal know-nothing can pass himself off as a wine expert if lent the right bow tie. Louis (José Garcia, with the moist eyes of Robert Downey Jr.), the depressive in question, is in the process of hanging himself from a Paris park tree when he's saved by passing stranger Antoine (seasoned Daniel Auteuil, recalling his early comic roles before Jean de Florette). A loser at love with more neuroses up his arsenal than The Odd Couple 's Felix Unger, Louis is ungrateful; a manager at a Paris brasserie and a hapless nice guy, Antoine is undeterred from doing unwanted good. Rehabilitation of his prize booby includes giving Louis a job as a sommelier (with advice to always recommend a burgundy) and tracking down the jilted lover's ex (Sandrine Kiberlain). The pileup of complications, the animated title sequence, and even the pop song that bounces the action along are weightlessly silly  and unabashedly nice. Suicidal depression has rarely looked so amusing.

ierre Salvadori's meandering comedy "Apr�s Vous" offers the pleasure of watching the great French actor Daniel Auteuil squirm delicately through the role of the world's most overzealous, uptight good Samaritan. With a slight wrinkle of the nose and a hardening of his expression, Mr. Auteuil can morph from a rabbity milquetoast into a shark. The expression he wears through much of the movie is a half-and-half look of pained exasperation, which lets him wring a hundred variations on the discomfort of someone forced to appear composed amid chaos of his own devising. His character, Antoine, manages a snooty Parisian restaurant where wine is the thing. His life changes the night he saves a stranger by dashing into a park and cutting the noose  as he is about to hang himself. With Louis (Jos� Garcia), the would-be suicide, protesting every step of the way, Antoine drags him home to the apartment he shares with Christine (Marilyne Canto), his girlfriend of three years. And over her strenuous objections, Antoine makes it his personal mission to fix everything wrong in Louis's life. A neurotic, self-pitying drama queen, whom Mr. Garcia plays as a manipulative crybaby wallowing in misery with a mischievous, barely disguised sense of enjoyment, Louis is a good Samaritan's worst nightmare. Because he has already mailed a farewell letter to his grandparents, Antoine takes it upon himself to intercept this final bleat of agony and to improvise a phony message of well-being, which he recites to Louis's nearly blind grandmother (Andr�e Tainsy). Next on Antoine's things-to-do list is to give Louis a crash course in wine stewardship and then cajole the hard-bitten owner of the restaurant he manages into hiring Louis as its new sommelier. The scene in which Louis, tongue-tied and panic-stricken, auditions for the job and gargles the sample from his wine-tasting test while Antoine frantically coaches him in sign language is the movie's funniest. It is nearly matched by Louis's complete ineptitude on the job, which Antoine tries to cover up by paying for high-priced wines that make Louis look like a persuasive salesman. If "Apr�s Vous" maintained this level of humor, it might have been a classic of its kind. But once Antoine tries to salvage Louis's miserable love life, the movie goes flat. The immediate spur to Louis's act of self-destruction was his being dumped by his willowy, poker-faced girlfriend, Blanche (Sandrine Kiberlain), whom Antoine tracks down at the flower shop where she works. Insinuating himself into her life, he begins to meddle and pull strings, and the story starts to lose track of itself in these increasingly bewildering, unfunny romantic shenanigans. As the movie drags on for nearly two hours, you get the uneasy sense that Mr. Salvadori and his screenwriting collaborators are making it up as they go along. The farcical tone softens, and the visual jokes fizzle. Ms. Kiberlain, when well used in the movies, conveys an ambiguous mixture of fragility and backbone, but her subtle acting style is not suited for farce. The use of comic leitmotifs  -  a cardboard cutout of Blanche's profile, a telltale cigarette lighter that is passed from one character to another, and the oft-quoted phrase "narcissistic injury"  -  lends the movie an appearance of form, even after its structure has crumbled. Had it had the concision and symmetry of a classic French farce, "Apr�s Vous" could have been an irresistible laugh machine. "Apr�s Vous" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language and sexual situations.

An unlikely bond -- with the emphasis on unlikely -- forms between a man determined to commit suicide and the man who saves him in "After You." Elegantly written, well-thesped comedy is too hermetic and bittersweet to be laugh-out-loud funny, but sustains a fairly successful ratio of uncomfortable situations to amusing solutions. Enthusiastic reviews, and general affection for talented central trio of Daniel Auteuil, Jose Garcia and Sandrine Kiberlain, suggest decent local returns for the pic, which went out Dec. 17 opposite "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King."
Antoine (Auteuil) works as a tuxedoed maitre d' at Chez Jean, a charming old Paris brasserie. Antoine is so profoundly hooked on being of service to others that he can't say "No": If there's a problem, big or small, he endeavors to solve it on the spot.
Well over an hour late for dinner with his long-suffering g.f., Christine (Marilyne Canto), Antoine takes a detour to rescue a man in the process of hanging himself from a tree. The well-meaning Antoine had no way of knowing that Louis (Garcia), distraught over the departure of his girlfriend, Blanche (Kiberlain), really did want to end it all. Feeling guilty over his unwanted intervention, Antoine invites Louis to stay with him, and then starts to go way above and way beyond the call of duty.
When Louis remembers he mailed a sinister farewell letter to his elderly grandparents, Antoine drives all night to their village enclave in hopes of intercepting the missive. The postman gets to granny's door first, but Antoine cleverly averts disaster.
Antoine then arranges for Louis -- who hasn't held a job for five years -- to try out at Chez Jean. After a delectably awkward interview for the position of wine steward, Louis -- who knows wine like Britney Spears knows opera -- is given a one-week trial. Louis' performance is disastrous, but Antoine comes up with an ingenious ruse to keep him employed.
Antoine also decides to track down Blanche and see if a reconciliation is possible. But from the moment he locates the lanky florist, his problems intensify.
Pic's template is Hollywood-style screwball comedy but, filtered through French storytelling rhythms and an underlying layer of cruelty, result is less diverting than it should be. To its credit, action is anchored in a realm where characters have jobs and actually spend time at work. However, as Antoine's meddling and adjusting become a full-time occupation and no good turn goes unpunished, the romance that should be at pic's center is buffeted so often that the outcome seems more like a toss of the coin than a structural imperative.
Helmer Pierre Salvadori ("Wild Target," "The Apprentices") opts for a stately rather than frantic pace, and gets lovely perfs from his seasoned cast. Recurring mid-'70s tune "Papa Tango Charly" is both infectious and annoying -- just like Louis. Animated opening credits are adorable.

Rock of underages: Kids get Zap-tized by tyrannical tutor
The short-fused motormouth who runs the Paul Green School of Rock Music , an after-school program for nine-to-17-year-olds in Philadelphia , has claimed, not unreasonably, to be the inspiration for Jack Black 's character in School of Rock. But where Richard Linklater 's movie approached its central incongruitythe idea that anti-establishment rock can and should be schooled with a breezy mix of ironic farce and fuck-the-Man feelgoodism, Paul Green , the frustrated musician and self-proclaimed "really good teacher" at the center of this documentary, embraces the same philosophy with grim, cranky resolve. Students like Madi, a Quaker folkie, and Will, the resident depressive, attest that rock school is a misfit sanctuary and that Green's manic tantrums serve a motivational purpose. In any case, as Will deadpans, "It's a lovable quirk that he's mentally disturbed."
But with his Hannibal Lecter  impersonations, Vietnam  P.O.W. re-enactments, and borderline abusive teasing, Green tends to be more actively unpleasant than amusing. He almost gets misty-eyed envisioning a 2007 issue of Rolling Stone : "Where did all these bands come from? All of a sudden they start tracing stuff back to me." Given that Green's curriculum is even more ossified than his fictional counterpart's, this immodest forecast assumes the resurgent popularity of Frank Zappa -style art-prog. There's plenty of talent on display12-year-old guitar prodigy CJ kills every time he's onbut as the kids dutifully make the pilgrimage to Germany 's tribute-band Zappanale, it's depressingly clear whose dreams they're acting out. (Is it really fair to be force-feeding drug music to listeners who aren't, um, properly equipped to enjoy it?) Don Argott's lively documentary, ostensibly a paean to alternative pedagogy, extends its subject a long leash, and he in turn does his damnedest to sabotage the project. Rock School ends up being a movie about just how little fun rock 'n' roll can be.
