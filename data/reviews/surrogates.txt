With breathless lines of dialogue like “Their brains were liquefied in their skulls!’’  - referring to onscreen characters, not the audience  - it’s awfully tempting to let “Surrogates’’ review itself. In fact, the latest Bruce Willis futuristic action rama-lama is a reasonably watchable sci-fi B movie, a case of a good director and some intriguing ideas struggling to overcome formula plotting, limp dialogue, and a serious case of the sillies. Give credit to filmmaker Jonathan Mostow for keeping the movie on track; give credit to star Bruce Willis for keeping a straight face.
Willis plays Tom Greer, a FBI agent of the near future, when 98 percent of the population stays at home while their robotic Surrogates  - replicants that look like younger, prettier versions of their owners  - go to work and play, feeding the sensations back to the atrophying humans hooked to their stim-chairs. It’s sort of like “The Matrix’’ turned inside out, and we’re our own worst enemy.
The boilerplate plot involves a chase after a dastardly superweapon  - it looks like a flashlight  - that fries Surrogates in public while killing their humans at home. Greer and his partner (Radha Mitchell) follow the trail of carnage all the way to a tribe of anti-Surrogate Luddites (led by Ving Rhames in dreadlocks), a corporate conspiracy and other nefarious doings, leading to a race against time to push a computer key that will save the human race.
Against such nonsense, Mostow comes up with some impressive visual ways to convey the radical social disconnect caused by the Surrogates. Their faces have been given a CGI makeover, for one thing, so that they all look like extras from “The Polar Express.’’ A subway car full of Surrogates heading home from work is an eerie sight that may hit home with anyone who’s had a bad day; a glimpse of hundreds of soldiers fighting an overseas war from their stim-chairs is a frightening notion the movie doesn’t pursue.
Actually, there are ideas abandoned by the wayside throughout the movie, sacrificed to plot illogic and a too-short running time. Is the film’s message that we’re already too jacked into our computers and Blackberrys? If so, it’s left on the cutting room floor. At least we finally get Willis with and without hair in the same movie  - the unconvincingly toupeed one is the Surrogate; the balding, beaten-up one is “real.’’ The actor, God love him, gives both roles his all  - the mark of a B-movie trouper.
Among its other eccentricities, “Surrogates’’ offers a day-after-tomorrow picture of Boston that doesn’t jibe with the city as most of us know it, despite creative location filming all over the greater metropolitan area. It’s one thing to put the hero’s apartment in the South End’s Cathedral Housing projects; it’s another to reclaim the entire South Boston waterfront as an anti-robot wasteland. Good luck getting Anthony’s Pier 4 to move.

In this serviceable sci-fi thriller set in a near future where imperfect humans stay home and program prettier robots to represent them out in the world, the moral is this: Be yourself, even if, in the case of Bruce Willis, it means accepting your male-pattern baldness. Willis stars in Surrogates  as an FBI agent investigating irregularities in the lucrative surrogacy biz. Rosamund Pike plays his wife, who prefers things plastic and pretty. There's fun robot stuff, some good philosophical ideas, and a brief, nutty Willis-Ving Rhames reunion 15 years after Pulp Fiction .


 The nifty premise of “Surrogates” builds on a science-fiction conceit familiar from the likes of the 1973 movie “Westworld” and the online game “Second Life.” In a reality that looks a lot like today’s  (a Prius is the most far-out car), human beings hide away at home,  where, hooked up with electrodes,  they live, work and play through robotic surrogates. Idealized types — which, because this is a Hollywood movie, means a lot of balloon breasts and itty-bitty noses — these avatars or “surries” allow their meat-puppeteers not just to act but also to feel by remote, a state of alienated affairs that has lowered the crime rate while also forcing lumpy, spotty, all-too-human naysayers onto machine-free reservations.  So how does Bruce Willis fit into all this? Not comfortably. But then, if you were a bald action star forced into a dandified blond wig and an f/x face-lift, as he is to play his character’s surrogate, you would sneak looks for the exit too. Although he ditches his creepy counterpart fairly early, Mr. Willis has little to do but hit his predictable marks and mouth the generic dialogue. In this kind of industrial entertainment, particularly one that seems to be missing some connective narrative tissue, it’s hard to know if the writers, John Brancato and Michael Ferris (working from the graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele), or the director, Jonathan Mostow, can be credited or blamed for what’s left on screen.  “Surrogates” is rated PG-13. (Parents strongly cautioned.) Fisticuffs, gun violence, smashed robots.

A film about robots that might find its biggest fans among Luddites, "Surrogates" is an intense and eerily plausible sci-fi thriller. Set in a future that uncannily resembles the present day (it must be one of the first pictures with a car chase featuring a Prius), Jonathan Mostow's smart speculative suspenser imagines a time when people can live through ideal versions of themselves while they sit wired up at home. Commercial prospects would seem solid but for the misleading and off-putting ad campaign, with very good international and ancillary careers in store for this Bruce Willis starrer.
Effective science fiction often reflects the preoccupations and anxieties of the moment when it is made, and "Surrogates," based on a graphic novel by Robert Venditti and Brett Weldele, certainly speaks to the way people today increasingly live on their computers and other electronic devices and project themselves into the world through them. The idea that one day we may need to choose between living life directly or virtually provides the dramatic tension for the script by Mostow's "Terminator 3" collaborators John Brancato and Michael Ferris.
Rapid-fire opening credits montage reveals the technological advances that lead to the "now" of the story. With 99% of the population connected to surrogates, crime, racism and other ills have been eradicated and the streets are filled with nothing but young and attractive people. An amusing, entirely credible throwaway scene shows a military war room that resembles an orderly video arcade, with a distant desert war being fought by surrogate soldiers (who can't be killed, only mechanically damaged) visible on screens.
So life is good; everyone is pretty, there's no physical danger and people can live out their fantasies from the comfort of their "stim chairs," where no one has to see them age. There is a small dropout movement that rejects surrogacy, led by a charismatic figure called the Prophet (Ving Rhames), but these scruffy losers are confined to "reservations" where they lead a subsistence existence (and are conspicuous by virtue of their exceptional unattractiveness).
But trouble comes to paradise when two humans die when their surrogates are "killed," which is not supposed to happen. It doesn't take FBI agents Thomas Greer (Willis) and Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell) long to figure out that a rebel has gotten his hands on a unique weapon capable of bridging the surrogate/controller divide.
Willis' appearance is at first disconcerting; with smooth features and a blond toupe, he looks about 35, and there is something just a little off about how Greer, Peters and others stare, don't register reactions immediately and move in ever-so-slightly abrupt ways. They look like heavily retouched photographs come to life through fractional time-delay, providing just the right, light touch of creepiness to a population that looks as though it stepped out of the pages of Vogue and GQ.
Drama turns on how Greer, deprived of his surrogate after a hair-raising helicopter pursuit and crash, re-enters the world in true human form (Willis with the more familiar bald pate and goatee), much to the consternation of his wife, Maggie (Rosamund Pike), who's addicted to the surrogate lifestyle and, in a nutshell, isn't interested in growing old together. In "aged" form, Greer sticks out on the streets of Boston like a Rip Van Winkle at a singles' bar as he tries to get to the bottom of the mystery, which involves a trip to the "reservation" for a confrontation with the Prophet and, ultimately, a search for the elusive inventor of the surrogates, Dr. Lionel Canter (James Cromwell), who long ago split with the giant corporation that markets the replicants.
Mostow includes sufficient de rigueur action scenes for the popcorn crowd, and he's good at them, but what keeps the film flying at a comparatively high altitude is the sharply focused manner in which it follows through on its premise. There are aspects of the surrogate lifestyle -- reproduction, for starters -- that aren't addressed, but the picture refuses to be distracted by inessentials, and pays off on everything it sets up.
"Surrogates" distinguishes itself from countless other thematically overlapping films by being not about robots run amok, but about humans seduced by the easy life; humanity here has "advanced" so far that it has become subordinate to its substitute. As a cautionary sci-fier, it's not all that far removed from such classics as "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," and if eyebrows are raised over the issue that "Surrogates" runs only 88 minutes, it's worth remembering that the those two '50s originals ran just 92 and 80 minutes, respectively.
With the exception of Willis, who effectively trots out his wary but determined Everyman persona once his well-scrubbed substitute goes MIA, the actors are mostly required to look great and behave with a certain glacial impenetrability, which Mitchell, Pike, Boris Kodjoe (as an FBI supervisor) and James Francis Ginty (as Canter's surrogate) lead the way in doing. Devin Ratray gets good mileage out of his role as a computer whiz too proud of his corpulent geekiness to consider a more glamorous substitute.
Production values are immaculate.

A montage of news footage crisply introduces the not-too-distant future, where the worlds white-collar professionals live vicariously through plastic-smooth swimsuit-cut surrogate bodies, psychically remote-controlled by flesh-and-blood selves abandoned to storage and pallid vegetation. These super-durable avatars are free to live in (somewhat timidly imagined) consequence-free hedonism. No real victims means no crimes, hence not much work for our FBI agent  (Bruce Willis ), until an unheard-of murder draws him to the ghettos of the offline human minority. As he investigates, director Jonathan Mostow  takes the tired anti-authoritarian formula of dreadlocked granola resistance against well-equipped state thugs, and knots it in noir-ish contortions. Surrogates are played by human actors with the slightest emotional attenuation, recalling all-CGI movies that spend untold millions reinventing life. Willis is fine, both as his blond action figure (Zack Morris  hair) and actual self, in trusty bruised palooka mode. Mostow does good meat-and-potatoes genre work, coherent even when recklesswhich is why you probably dont know his name. His Internet-era Fahrenheit 451 , comes in nice and lean, with room for a couple of cherry action piecesthat surrogate bodies can be guiltlessly plowed over liberates his car chase, and Radha Mitchell  does fine acrobatics in high heels.
