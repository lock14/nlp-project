 The documentary “Oswald’s Ghost” initially plays as yet another primer on the assassination of John F. Kennedy, the vilification of Lee Harvey Oswald, the normalization of conspiracy theory and the collective aftershocks of a murder many Americans still consider unsolved.  Because the movie covers well-worn territory — and interviews the usual boldface names, including the assassination theorists Mark Lane and Edward Jay Epstein, the former CBS beat reporter Dan Rather and Norman Mailer — its existence raises a question: Why go here again?  The answer coalesces in the film’s second half. The director Robert Stone (“Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst”) draws parallels between the Johnson-Nixon era and the post-9/11 years — periods of introspection, paranoia, conservative-liberal animosity, executive-branch secrecy and war.  These comparisons aren’t new, either, but Mr. Stone does a diligent, sometimes eerie job of articulating them. Along the way he showcases plenty of television news snippets of Oswald and his assassin, Jack Ruby; Mr. Lane; the future senator Arlen Specter, who coined the dismissive phrase “magic bullet”; and other pivotal players. And he collects autumnal interviews with witnesses to a period when it seemed, to quote Mailer, “as if God had removed his sanction from America.

As a tutorial on the assassination of President John F. Kennedy -- encompassing the enormity of the tragedy, the testimony of eyewitnesses and other contemporaries, the scenarios of conspiracy theorists and, perhaps most important, the enduring impact on the American psyche -- "Oswald's Ghost" impresses as a concise, intelligent and rigorously well-researched piece of work. After a brief theatrical run to roughly coincide with the 44th anniversary of the epochal event, this latest effort from documaker Robert Stone ("Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst") will attract an attentive aud during its scheduled Jan. 14 airing on PBS.
Adroitly interweaving archival material (some of it surprisingly unfamiliar) with commentary by TV newscaster Dan Rather, former U.S. Sen. Gary Hart and Warren Commission critic Mark Lane, among others, Stone emphasizes how, for Americans alive and sentient on Nov. 22, 1963, the JFK assassination was every bit as traumatic as the events of 9/11. Baby boomers may take this for granted, of course, but docu should prove invaluably enlightening to younger auds who do not have living memories of the 35th U.S. president's life and times.
Stone also attempts to pierce through the clouds of mystery that still engulf Lee Harvey Oswald, viewed here variously as a clueless patsy, a lethally accurate killer or possibly both. "Oswald's Ghost" duly notes that, even now, an estimated 70% of all Americans believe Oswald did not act alone.
But pic is structured so that its emotional climax unmistakably is the scene in which Norman Mailer -- whose recent death makes his weary gravitas here all the more affecting -- admits, with equal measures of sadness and resignation, that he reluctantly came to believe Oswald changed the course of history on his own: "That there were conspiracies being contemplated, even attempted on that day, I'm perfectly willing to accept. But the conclusions I came to were for me rational ones, because (Oswald) had a motive for doing it, because he was capable of doing it -- and because he wanted
 to do it."

The murder of John F. Kennedy the unsolved  murder, according to an overwhelming majority of Americanshas never lost its creepy fascination. In this riveting yet ultimately unsatisfying documentary, veteran director Robert Stone  revisits the scene of the crime as well as the conspiracy theories that persist to various degrees. Oswald's Ghost  is grippingly effective as a detailed recap for the huge chunk of the populace born after 1963 (or anyone stumped trying to separate fact from furious, feverish fiction in JFK ); it also does an excellent job of shaking the foundations of the belief systems that have calcified around the major plots and perp(s). Stone is less successful in drawing a line from JFK's assassination through the turmoil of the '60s to Watergate and the continuing cynicism and distrust that Americans evince toward government today. Although he doesn't solve the murderor even tryStone argues quite convincingly that Kennedy's horrifically violent death will continue to prickle the national psyche.
