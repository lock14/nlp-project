 Mere moments, it seems, after appearing as a loony Southern landowner in "Crazy Like a Fox," Roger Rees, the perpetually befuddled-looking actor, is on our screens as a desperate masochist in "Going Under." Cheerfully baring every inch of a body Brad Pitt could be proud of, this 62-year-old Welshman plays Peter, a married therapist who becomes overly attached to his dominatrix, Suzanne (Geno Lechner). Suzanne is so creative with the racking and the piercing that when she decides to quit her dungeon job Peter is unwilling to let her go; but can their mutual affection survive above ground?  Unfortunately it's difficult to care. "Going Under" douses its potentially steamy topic in coolly restrained dialogue and an atmosphere of clinical permissiveness. From Peter's conveniently worldly wife — who barely blinks when he announces, "There's a dominant I've been seeing" — to Suzanne's affectless female lover, the movie's characters display an unnerving emotional sophistication.  Only when this cracks does the film feel authentic; but the director, Eric Werthman, a practicing psychotherapist, presents Peter and Suzanne's dilemma like a case study from his own files rather than a real, flesh-and-blood-and-handcuffs relationship. The distance is compounded by the movie's eye-straining interiors, awash in red filtered shadows and the occasional flare of pasty white flesh.  Watching "Going Under" you won't learn much about S-and-M, but your opinion of 60-something nudity will be altered beyond belief.
In the surprisingly flaccid s&m potboiler Going Under , Roger Rees  gives a master class in how to suffer for art. The 62-year-old British stage vet undergoes multiple genital piercings, submits to a bare-ass beating with a riding crop, gets clawed with Edward Scissorhands   prosthetics, and endures numerous humiliationsnot the least of which involves squandering his considerable talent on a trashy B movie far beneath his stature. Playing more nude scenes than would be contractually possible with an actor half his age, he writhes in passion and agony, furrowing his bushy brows and contorting his weathered face to squeeze some life out of his one-note character, a therapist obsessed with the dominatrix who dumps him just as they were about to turn their business relationship into an affair. No one else in the cast comes close; some don't even bother to act at all. At times, inchoate ideas (emotional wounds hurt deeper than physical pain?) threaten to congeal into an actual theme, but that turns out to be, like the rest of the film, a drawn-out tease. Just because Rees can play a masochist doesn't mean viewers have to.
