After "Amadeus," "Ragtime," and "Valmont," you'd think director Milos Forman would know his way around a period epic. And it's true that his new film has all the deluxe trappings one expects of the genre: gaudy costumes, an international cast chattering away in various accents, the history, the wigs.
To no avail. Far easier to mock than it is to enjoy, "Goya's Ghosts " is an overstuffed turkey that's entertaining for all the wrong reasons. It may in fact be the comedy of the summer, a melodramatic folly whose ambitions consistently curdle into camp. Still, there are worse reasons to go to the movies.
What's wrong? For starters: Randy Quaid
 as King Carlos IV of 18th-century Spain? The actor turns in an intentionally droll performance -- his monarch is boorish but dangerously sly, like Jeffrey Jones 's Emperor Joseph II in "Amadeus" -- but for the life of me, I can't look at Quaid without hearing his deathless sentiments from "National Lampoon's Vacation ": "I don't know why they call this stuff Hamburger Helper. It does just fahn
 by itself. "
"Goya's Ghosts" could have used a little Hamburger Helper. Purportedly a stirring tale of the collision of religious fundamentalism and Enlightenment ideals during the Napoleonic Wars, the film casts Stellan Skarsgard as Francisco Jose de Goya y Lucientes -- because when you think of one of the towering figures of Spanish art you immediately look to Sweden for the casting.
Painter to the court and printmaker of darkly subversive political etchings, Goya remains on the film's sidelines, bedeviling the monks of the Spanish Inquisition while keeping in the king's good graces. "Goya's Ghosts" mostly concerns itself with Brother Lorenzo , a fire-breathing inquisitor
 played by Javier Bardem as a ripe exercise in overacting. I'm not sure whether Bardem's in on the joke, but this is one marvelous side of ham.
Looking for heretics in every corner, Brother Lorenzo spies the beauteous Ines (Natalie Portman ), daughter of a Toledo merchant (Jose Luis Gomez ) whose ancestors long ago converted from Judaism. Not long enough, apparently; the monk has the girl thrown into the catacombs, where his sexual urges battle with his love of a good flogging.
The Inquisition is on the wane and Napoleon's army is on the march. A smart monk would do well to keep his options open, and Lorenzo is one canny brother. "Goya's Ghosts" unfolds over several decades, with twists and coincidences and long-lost heirs laid on top of a vibrant historical canvas. It's the kind of all-stops-out barnstormer that worked for Dickens and D.W. Griffith , but that needs serious finessing for a 21st-century audience to buy in.
Sadly, finesse is the one quality missing here -- that and a convincing female lead. In the dual role of Ines and, later, her daughter, an amoral courtesan named Alicia , Portman officially reveals her limitations; she acts more with her teeth than her intelligence. On the other hand, the movie does everything short of shipping her out on an ice floe to win our sympathy.
Skarsgard's Goya is a tough customer undone by his love for his muse, Ines. We're meant to see the era through his eyes -- democracy warring with the church, the common folk hammering at the door of history -- but the turgid plot keeps getting in the way. Bardem's Brother Lorenzo is gone for long stretches, and his energy is missed. Nor does "Goya's Ghosts" work as a metaphor for modern state-sponsored torture, although Forman and his legendary screenwriter Jean-Claude Carriere ("Belle de Jour ," "Cyrano de Bergerac ") certainly lay the groundwork.
The problem is focus: The movie has none. A viewer appreciates the pockets of wayward creativity -- Bardem's nostril-flaring, the cinematography of Javier Aguirresarobe ("The Others ") -- and mourns what could have been while stifling a polite guffaw. No one expects the Spanish Inquisition . . . to be funny.

         "Goya's Ghosts" is Milos Forman's first film since 1999, but you sincerely wish it wasn't. A logy, rambling period piece, it feels about as far away from the spirit of "Amadeus" as it's possible to get with wigs and britches. Focusing only incidentally on its title character, the new film wanders distractedly around 19th century Spain in search of a cohesive idea, or failing that, a through line, but it doesn't come up with much beyond the hard-to-dispute observation that power is a gateway to hypocrisy.
 
 The movie begins during the reign of the doltish Charles IV (who indeed bore an uncanny resemblance to the perfectly cast Randy Quaid) and continues through the Napoleonic invasion and French occupation under Joseph Bonaparte, ending with Napoleon's defeat by the British. In the first half of the film, Goya is marginally involved in some Inquisition intrigue involving Natalie Portman's naked torture and subsequent fondling by a priest. Timely as the themes are, they have little to do with Goya except as they concern his role as a well-connected go-between.
 


         






   Played by Stellan Skarsgård, the great Spanish painter not only remains a passive bystander in his own story, but a credulous dupe besides. It's hard to square this image of a genial but definitely slow-on-the-uptake Goya with his work. Considered to be the last Old Master and one of the first modernists, Goya's work was provocative to the point of being subversive and often so dark as to border on the macabre. His painting of the family of Charles IV was so gleefully tactless it was later described by the French critic Théophile Gautier as looking like a portrait of "the corner baker and his wife after they won the lottery."
 
 Forman's Goya paints with the same brutal frankness but displays none of it in life. When Inez Bilbatua (Portman), the daughter of his friend and patron, the wealthy merchant Tomás de Bilbatua (José Luis Gomez), is summoned by the Holy Office after refusing a bite of glazed suckling pig in a tavern (the Inquisitors accuse her of "Judaizing"), Goya half-heartedly agrees to help and comes to regret it. Meanwhile, Bilbatua's own efforts to save her are unsuccessful 
and the artist's muse that went in the dungeon comes out 15 years later gray-haired, dirt-caked and sporting a broken jaw. She looks like Madame Lafarge after a bar fight.
 
 The priest that got her into this mess in the first place, and then several more, is Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem), who in the beginning of the film is seen lobbying the head inquisitor Father Gregorio (Michael Lonsdale) for the chance to revitalize the Inquisition for the Enlightenment era — Inquisition 2.0 — by the end of the film has become a Voltaire-quoting spreader of the revolution. Either way, he's a weasel, and Bardem, who looks like nothing if not a Minotaur, plays him with snaky finesse. He's even enough of a good sport to modify his Castilian accent into a nonspecific Mid-Atlantic mumble that it winds up making him sound like a Hispanophone Madonna.
 
 It's a minor detail, but it plagues the movie as a whole. Inquisitors with English accents denounce "Goyer," a little Spanish Maja with an American accent wrinkles her nose at the roast pig in the manner of a Palos Verdes teenager on vacation in Segovia. Only the extras sound incongruously like locals — and why bother, at that point?
 
 Lavish production and wardrobe design, as well as beautiful cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe make "Goya's Ghosts" lovely to look at, but as a portrait of the artist, the movie is a letdown.
 
  The biggest ghost in the movie is Goya himself.

In a season of digital bombast, it can be a relief to walk into a stodgy life-of-the-great-man costume drama. Goya's Ghosts , before it turns into a messy, horse-drawn load, achieves a civilized stuffiness that gives off its own mild pleasure. Directed by Milos Forman, it's the sort of movie in which the hero adds a dab of paint to the canvas, and you never remotely believe he has painted that painting. You never even believe that Stellan Skarsgard, as the incendiary artist Francisco de Goya, is Spanish . You go with it, though, because Skarsgard brings a cynical twinkle to the role of a subversive who is also a worldly, connected man.
Goya's Ghosts  isn't really a tale of genius. It starts off as a message movie about the Spanish Inquisition, as Lorenzo (Javier Bardem), a cleric with the leer of a child molester, decides to make an example of Ines (Natalie Portman), the dewy daughter of a merchant, who's tortured for having refused a dish of pork. By Lorenzo's logic, she must be a ''Judaizer.'' There is much dining-room debate about the effectiveness of torture  scenes clearly meant to comment on current U.S. tactics.
And then? Then the movie goes kerplooey. It leaps ahead to the French Revolution, ditches the torture theme, tries (in vain) to add a vague note of sympathy to Bardem's cad, and gives Portman a ridiculous second role, as a flashing-eyed harlot saint. No wonder the twinkle drains out of Skarsgard. Goya's Ghosts  is such a botch, it left me yearning for a little digital bombast.

 “Goya’s Ghosts,” the new feature from the director Milos Forman (“Amadeus,” “Man on the Moon”), is an unwieldy mix of political satire and lavish period soap opera. Set in 18th-century Spain, and covering the last phase of the Inquisition and Napoleon’s occupation, it resembles the Oscar-baiting epics that Miramax used to release: white elephants like “Chocolat” and “The Cider House Rules” that mixed art-house swagger, Hollywood glitz and shout-outs to liberal common wisdom.  The tale begins with Spanish church elders condemning etchings by Goya that depict the torture of dissidents and heretics. “These images show us the true face of our country,” frets Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem), a quasiliberal monk who has asked Goya (Stellan Skarsgard) to paint his portrait, but also exhorts the Roman Catholic Church to fortify the Inquisition and purify the country.  Mr. Forman and his co-writer, Jean-Claude Carrière (once a frequent collaborator with Luis Buñuel), depict Goya as an artist trying to balance the need to make a living against the obligation to document atrocities committed in the name of God and war. (When Napoleon invades Spain in the film’s second half, Goya again becomes a witness to history.)  But Goya’s presence in the film recedes after he asks Brother Lorenzo to investigate the disappearance of one of his models, Ines, (Natalie Portman, likable but bland), the daughter of a rich merchant.  Ines is being held incommunicado for the crime of having a Jewish ancestor. The sequence depicting church interrogators grilling her about a recent supper (she’s said to have refused pork) balances satire and terror with precision. (The hard cut from Ines politely asking questioners what she can do to prove her honesty to a naked, screaming Ines hanging upside-down from a rack is an early candidate for transition of the year.)  Equally bracing is a sequence in which Lorenzo, after forcing himself on Ines in prison, has dinner with her family and lamely tries to reassure them that if Ines truly loved God, no amount of pain would make her sign a false confession. Ines’s family disproves Lorenzo’s claim with a panache that Charles Bronson would have appreciated.  By recreating Inquisition brutality, “Goya’s Ghosts” aims to denounce the West’s bludgeoning response to terrorism. But its rhetorical tactics are jejune; its comparison of 21st-century America and Inquisition-era Spain doesn’t track; and its second half abandons satire for half-baked historical melodrama.  Mr. Bardem’s portrayal of the newly enlightened Lorenzo — who tries to help Ines find the daughter they had together when she was a captive — is filled with fine brush strokes that make the character compelling, if not quite comprehensible. But the sight of Ms. Portman playing both Ines and her daughter, Alicia — a grimy prostitute — is alternately distracting and laughable.  Randy Quaid’s supporting turn as the dimwit thug King Carlos IV is an inferior rehash of Jeffrey Jones’s peerless work as Emperor Joseph II in “Amadeus.” And the film’s stumblebum attempts to transform the opportunistic hypocrite-rapist Lorenzo into yet another of the director’s martyred rebel heroes — each noble gesture backed by an “Applaud now!” score — is auteurism run amok.    “Goya’s Ghosts” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for battlefield violence, torture, nudity and rape.

Milos Forman's "Goya's Ghosts" attempts to make hay of the historical coincidence of the Spanish Inquisition, the rise of Napoleon and the life of Goya, but fails to do them justice. Ambitious script is stranded between entertainment and intellectualism, leaving us with a magnificent folly, thoroughly watchable for its visuals but ultimately hollow. Forman's imposing track record will provoke offshore interest, but it is hard to see such awkward-to-classify fare generating mainstream attention beyond selected Euro territories. Saul Zaentz's production has thus far bypassed the fest circuit and has no Yank distrib as yet.
Director's previous Euro period pieces, "Amadeus" and "Valmont," were constructed on gold-plated foundations (Peter Shaffer's play and "Les Liaisons Dangereuses" respectively), but such inspiration is notably absent here.
Early scenes, set in 1792, show members of the Inquisition, including the Inquisitor General (Michael Lonsdale) and Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem) leafing uncomfortably though Goya's famously subversive "Caprichos" etchings. The Inquisitor General is troubled Lorenzo has commissioned a portrait from Goya (Stellan Skarsgard), and Lorenzo, keen to rectify the bad impression, suggests the Inquisition revert to its former severity.
Their first victim is Goya's model Ines (Natalie Portman), beautiful daughter of wealthy merchant Tomas Bilbatua (Jose Luis Gomez). She is arrested by the Inquisition because she's been spotted refusing to eat pork.
Ines is put to "The Question," a euphemism for torture, and ends up confessing. Lorenzo visits the dungeons where Ines is being held, and it is suggested he rapes her -- one of several important but implausible plot points on which too much later depends. Tomas invites Lorenzo for a meal at which he seeks to prove that under torture, people will confess anything -- the issue at the pic's moral heart, clumsily handled.
In a wholly implausible scene of almost Pythonesque absurdity, Lorenzo is tortured in Tomas' dining room and signs a document confessing to being the offspring of monkeys. Given the nature of the Inquisition, it seems unlikely such effrontery would have brought with it no consequences for Tomas and his retinue, as it does in the pic.
Humiliated in public and Goya's portrait of him burned, Lorenzo becomes a fugitive from Inquisitorial justice. The general intensity is lightened by a mostly unfunny storyline involving Goya's portrait of the ugly Queen Maria Luisa (Blanca Portillo), wife of King Carlos IV (Randy Quaid).
Pic jumps ahead 15 years to the Napoleon's invasion of Spain, the abolition of the Inquisition, the implausible transformation of Lorenzo (who returns as an Enlightenment revolutionary) and the release of the physically destroyed Ines from prison, carrying with her a dramatically uninspired secret that dominates the film's wearying second half.
Pic reps a flawed and somewhat sterile discourse on the dangers of unlimited power, hypocrisy and mistaken identity, in which the characters are at the service of the ideas. The fact the film has no love relationship may be because the social climate as shown doesn't permit it, but it might have provided some emotional warmth, and a respite from all the Machiavellianism.
Project is permeated by black-and-white, good vs. evil logic from which the characters, especially Bardem's, struggle to escape. The Spanish thesp, at the pic's dramatic and emotional core, oozes discomfort in a role that requires him to be both a sinister yet soft-voiced Inquisition tough, and an enlightened liberal. He ends up playing Lorenzo as a straight-up, if occasionally self-questioning, self-seeker who fails to connect with the viewer. Though his face is a wonderfully expressive vehicle, Bardem is hampered here by his English-language delivery, which is often muttered, oddly stressed and sometimes downright incomprehensible.
Though the film's title seems to promise a biopic, the figure of Goya is marginal; he lacks social context, and the key to his professional survival (apart from his talent) is his detachment from events, as he roams freely between the court and taverns. It was probably wise of Forman and co-scenarist Jean-Claude Carriere to present Goya as man rather than myth, and Skarsgard plays the swaggering, devil-may-care painter, later descending into embittered deafness, with perception and brio. But at least some celebration of, or at least enquiry into, the painter's extraordinary genius would have benefited the venture.
Portman is a particularly convincing muse for Goya earlier on, then spends much of the later stretch wearing startling, uglifying makeup and doing a good turn as a trembling madwoman. Dependable French thesp Lonsdale suggests a great deal in the few lines he has. Other perfs, as scripted, are monodimensional.
Pic's strength is its visuals; this period of Spanish history has never been cinematically depicted with such potency. Spanish d.p. Javier Aguirresarobe successfully unveils sumptuous, spacious interiors, dark dungeons, teeming taverns and (briefly) battlefields. The palely illuminated, wordless sequence following Ines' release as she hopelessly wanders the battle-ravaged streets of Madrid is pure poetry. Goya's magnificently grotesque depictions of the era receive homage throughout.
Though the pic is in English, background murmur in courts and taverns is, somewhat awkwardly, in Spanish; the occasional gracelessness of the dialogue is not helped by the fact it is rendered in so many different accents. Varhan Bauer's melodic score is employed discreetly and to maximum effect. Period detail is excellent, while Yvonne Blake's lovingly attended-to costume design is also worthy of mention.

Milos Forman  has built his career by pushing the limits of the Hollywood  biopic. Amadeus showed Mozart through the eyes of Salieri; The People vs. Larry Flint   made a porn-pusher look like Jimmy Stewart ; Man on the Moon  hinted that Andy Kaufman  faked his death. One thing Forman has never done with a biopic, though, is not make a biopic. In that respect, if in no other, Goya's Ghosts  breaks new ground. Set in late-18th-century Spain, the drama centers on Goya's muse (Natalie Portman ), the daughter of a wealthy merchant who converted from Judaism. Unfortunately, Portman's picky eating (who doesn't like pork?) leads the Inquisition to condemn her, and it only gets worse when a young priest (Javier Bardem ), in a spectacular example of scholastic logic, takes her request for prayer as an invitation to rape. Not a bad setup, but then the French Revolution sweeps in and mucks everything up. After that, the film takes as many plot-twists as Pirates of the Caribbean ; distinctly Goya in its emphasis on the grotesque, it shows none of the Spaniard's artistic economy.
