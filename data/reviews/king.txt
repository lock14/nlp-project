 The kingdom that the central character in "The King" wants to inherit may be here on earth but not anyplace that is always recognizable. A dark vision of contemporary America stitched together from both clichés and some lived-in emotions and atmosphere, this fitfully engaging, finally exasperating film involves a young Mexican-American whose search for his patrimony leads him into the bosom of a deeply religious Texas family and, in time, a world of inexplicable suffering. Much like David Cronenberg's superior "A History of Violence," and Lars Von Trier's "Dogville," the point appears to be the return of the (politically) repressed, American style, though here it's unclear to what end.  We first meet Elvis Valderez (the young Mexican actor Gael García Bernal) on board the United States Navy ship he is about to leave for good. Having been honorably discharged, he packs up his few belongings, including a rifle that brings to mind Chekhov's adage that a gun introduced in the first act must be fired by the last. From there it's a short hop to Corpus Christi, where he casually tools about, checks into some fleabag digs and cruises a dewy young churchgoer, Malerie (Pell James), who turns out to be the teenage daughter of a Baptist preacher, David Sandow (William Hurt). The pastor, in turn, happens to be Elvis's long-estranged father. With a smile, the son approaches this man of God, his nominal king, searching for a place at his side.  Rebuffed by David, who waves away his son and the past ("that was before I became a Christian"), Elvis starts sniffing around Malerie. The girl, sheltered by family and faith, is as unprepared for his attentions as she is receptive to them, having no idea that her suitor is also her half-brother. One thing leads to another, as might be expected when a man as pretty as Mr. Bernal starts romancing a 16-year-old virgin with a domineering father, and behind the wheel of a 1969 Cougar no less. Unlike most teenagers, or, for that matter, Oedipus, Elvis knows precisely what he's doing, incest being only his first transgression. The intentions of the film's British director, James Marsh, who wrote the script with Milo Addica, remain more opaque.  Mr. Marsh, whose previous films include a documentary about Elvis Presley's appalling eating habits, "The Burger and the King," and a fiction-nonfiction hybrid, "Wisconsin Death Trip," about people driven to violent acts appears to have a taste for American Gothic. (In Mr. Addica, one of the writers on "Monster's Ball" and "Birth," he appears to have found a kindred spirit.) The Sandows are the sort of true believers that American filmmakers often condemn or lampoon (see "Saved!"), and generally fail to get a real bead on. Although the cavernous, antiseptic church in which David preaches and in which his other son, Paul (Paul Dano), performs with his rock band, initially suggests that the filmmakers are similarly inclined toward derision, the Sandows emerge as surprisingly sympathetic, largely because of the actors.  They have their work cut out for them. Unafraid of stating the symbolically obvious, Mr. Marsh and Mr. Addica lard their story with the kind of touches — David gives Paul the present of a monstrous S.U.V., and the two bow-hunt a deer — that seem designed to raise the suspicions and even antipathy of the film's presumptively non-Baptist, art-house audience. Yet while the appealing Mr. Bernal can do little with the cruel task he has been given, the rest of the cast, particularly Mr. Hurt and Mr. Dano, invest their characters with real feeling. They make you care about men whose fundamentalism and contradictions never get in the way of their humanity, which is a triumph of a kind for a filmmaker who evinces too little of the same.  "The King" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It contains incestuous scenes and murder most foul.

The story of a veritable devil who comes to test and destroy a family of faith, "The King" is a noxious film morally and an aggravating one dramatically. Co-produced and co-written by Milo Addica," who co-wrote the estimable "Monster's Ball" and "Birth," and the first narrative feature from "Wisconsin Death Trip" documaker James Marsh, ambitious indie pic would more accurately have been titled "Texas Death Trip," given the insidious predilections of the would-be protagonist. Despite the presence of heartthrob Gael Garcia Bernal atop the cast, this promises to be a major turn-off for audiences in all markets.
"The King" shares with "Wisconsin" a fascination with the suspect and/or risible aspects of American life, with attention this time focused on Christians living in the aptly selected Corpus Christi, Texas, and a snake who enters the garden there. Filmmakers profess to having been influenced by such classics as "The Night of the Hunter," "Psycho," "Badlands" and "Blue Velvet," and while there are certainly crucial elements of the first and skeleton-in-the-closet aspects of the last, they should be so lucky as to ever have this film mentioned in such company from an artistic point of view.
Title can only be explained by the fact that Bernal, speaking flawless American, plays a young man named Elvis, which in turn prompts the notation that Marsh a decade ago made the docu "The Burger and the King," about Elvis Presley's eating habits. Upon his discharge from the Navy, Elvis heads for Corpus Christi and announces to local preacher man David Sandow (William Hurt) that he is Sandow's unknown bastard son via a liaison more than 20 years before.
Pastor Sandow reasonably asks Elvis to call him soon so they can speak before he breaks the news to his wife and two teenage children. But Elvis never calls, choosing instead to stalk and quickly deflower Sandow's virginal 16-year-old daughter Malerie (Pell James), without informing her that he's her half-brother.
This is just the overture for the symphony of hurt and cruelty Elvis visits upon the Sandows. In very short order, Elvis gets Malerie pregnant. Then, after her brother Paul (Paul Dano) spots the seducer sneaking out of the house one night, the staunchly religious young man follows Elvis to challenge him and tell him never to see his sister again, only to be stabbed to death for his trouble.
Successfully covering up all traces of the crime, Elvis now befriends the father to the point that he is invited to lodge in Paul's room while the latter is considered "missing." With this, it looks as though "The King" has been set up as a modern Cain and Abel story, with Elvis determined to test the limits of his father's Christian ability to forgive sin. Alas, just when it doesn't seem possible, the story pushes much, much further into transgressive territory, to the point where its nihilistic attitude surpasses the provocative to become unjustifiably ugly and pointless.
Stance might have been theoretically defensible if the script had explored Elvis' psychological or emotional condition, but pic takes no interest in that. Sure, he was filed away as a youthful indiscretion by his father, but there's never a suggestion that this is what motivates Elvis to do such evil; his dad even embraces him as part of the family after a decent interval, despite the distress it causes his wife (Laura Harring).
The film, then, like its central character, emerges as entirely unpalatable, despite attentive work by the actors, notably by Dano as the upright son and especially by James as the daughter completely unprepared to cope with the Gael force that hits her. Visual style occupies an uneasy middle ground between attempted atmospheric emphasis and docu-drama intensity.

A rather beautifully produced indie mix of melodrama, ethnographic detail, and modern Southern gothic, The King begins with a symbolic recipe Don McLean  might find shaky: a Corpus Christi  evangelist with a secret (William Hurt ), plus a wild-eyed, navy-fresh kid named Elvis who might be his illegit son (Gael García Bernal ), plus loads of suggestions about gardens, snakes, and blood-soaked sin. Brit director James Marsh  evidently has a touristy yen for lowdown Americanatwo of his earlier documentaries were Wisconsin Death Trip  and The Burger & the King: The Life & Cuisine of Elvis Presley  . Be that as it may, and despite a story that's as lackadaisical as it is programmatic, The King  has a hypnotically naturalist vibe, from the Jesus-clean Lone Star suburbs and low-rent, uncaricatured preachifying to the fall of afternoon light through old house windows and onto a teenager's skin. Bernal's weaselly nowhere man insinuates himself into Hurt's disciplined family and between the legs of its pubescent daughter (Pell James ), giving the localized action a dose of ancient-Greek octane.
The film survives on a thick diet of genuine acting moments. Bernal, as the Grand Guignol catalyst, plays it with the nearly hidden wariness of a sociopath, but it's impossible not to believe Paul Dano  as the family's pale, earnest scion/minister-to-be and James as the vulnerable girl among bow hunters whose job it is to swab up the deer guts. Best of all, Hurt expands on a great American archetypethe neocon mega-dad who's on a mission but lost, holy but poisoned from within, macho but never very sure of what's right. Probably no other actor standing today could've brought this much juice to such a potentially simplistic character.
