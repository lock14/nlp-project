You see it in sitcoms, on Broadway, and in the cracked-family movies that generate buzz at Sundance. It's the comedy of quirkiness, in which ''eccentric'' characters are placed  on screen to inspire an amused whatever!  shrug  that little ping of superiority we feel when a petty, deluded narcissist is pinned down and wriggling. Away We Go , a youngish-couple on-the-road comedy directed by Sam Mendes (Revolutionary Road ), from a script by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, is a gilded entry in the cinema du quirk. It's a movie that invites you, all too often, to feel superior to the people on screen. Yet it's been designed, shot, and edited with unusual finesse, and the two main characters are fresh screen types. Both are brainy, leftover-bohemian free spirits, and to the extent that the movie's condescension echoes their alt-dropout mystique, it's not just  smugness. It's an expression of who they are.
Burt (John Krasinski), who's 33, works for an insurance company but treats his job like an imposition, the implication being that  he thinks he's meant for better things. With his ironic geek glasses, indie-rock beard, and attitude of post-masculine weariness  (he's there to serve and be whimsically grumpy about it), he stands in for a subculture of ''creative'' types who have never gotten over their failure to actually create anything. Burt's girlfriend, Verona (Maya Rudolph), is pregnant, and though she's as directionless as he is, she at least knows that they're treating parenthood as just another chapter of postcollegiate languor. ''Are we f---ups?'' she asks. Yes, they are, but as they set out to visit their friends and relatives in Arizona, Wisconsin, Florida, and Canada, searching for a city to live in, they discover something redeeming: Everyone they know is even more  of a f---up.
Jeff Daniels and Catherine O'Hara play Burt's parents as exaggeratedly self-involved ciphers, and Allison Janney overacts as  Verona's shrill, brash, vulgar former colleague. A sequence with Maggie Gyllenhaal as a pious New Age feminist academic is so over-the-top I didn't buy it for a split second. But then, in Montreal, the film settles down in a scene with Verona's college chums (Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey), whose rainbow coalition of a family is full of love and hidden pain. For just a bit, the prospect of having a child starts to look as magical, and as daunting, as it should. Krasinski never loses his hip detachment, but Rudolph makes Verona, in her very lack of direction, a creature of furious, defiant flesh and blood. She anchors the quirkiness of Away We Go , and transcends it, too. B–

 Correction Appended  Are we screw-ups? Verona wonders aloud. (I’m paraphrasing.) She and her boyfriend, Burt, expecting their first child, live in a ramshackle, poorly heated house and drive a boxy old Volvo. They are maybe a little scruffy, but they seem, objectively, to be doing all right, with jobs that don’t require them to go to work and a relationship that looks tender and durable.  Verona’s question may or may not be disingenuous, but the answer provided by “Away We Go,” the slack little road comedy in which it arises, is unambiguous. Far from being screw-ups, Verona and Burt, played with passive-aggressive winsomeness by Maya Rudolph and John Krasinski, are manifestly superior to everyone else in the movie and, by implication, the world.  And even though they express themselves with a measure of diffidence, it’s clear that they are acutely, at times painfully, aware of their special status as uniquely sensitive, caring, smart and cool beings on a planet full of cretins and failures.  The smug self-regard of this movie, directed by Sam Mendes from a script by Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, takes a while to register, partly because Ms. Rudolph and Mr. Krasinski are appealing and unaffected performers and partly because the writing has some humor and charm. The opening scene, which finds the couple in bed, is disarmingly sweet and candid in its depiction of the sexual rapport of longtime lovers. There is real intimacy and affection between them, which is wonderful until, before too long, it becomes as insufferable as the songs by Alexi Murdoch, which similarly wear out their rueful, faux-naïve welcome.  The episodic narrative of “Away We Go” is spun from a thin, cute premise. The parents-to-be need to find a suitable place to raise their daughter, and their search gives them an opportunity to visit friends and relatives and to collect the nuggets of grievance and disappointment that fuel their search for perfect happiness.  Burt’s parents (Catherine O’Hara and Jeff Daniels) are a pair of giggly ninnies who have decided to decamp for Belgium, and their dinner table display of selfishness kicks off a transcontinental parade of bad child-rearing. A visit to Lily (Allison Janney), a former boss of Verona’s who lives in Phoenix, reveals a tableau of vulgar suburban dysfunction: fat, sullen kids; wildly inappropriate language; daytime drinking;  and free-floating political paranoia (courtesy of Lily’s husband, played by Jim Gaffigan).  These red state grotesques are offset, a bit later, by a family in Madison, Wis., whose matriarch, L N, a gender studies professor played by Maggie Gyllenhaal, is a soft-spoken medusa of political correctness and New Age malarkey.  Ms. Gyllenhaal and Ms. Janney are both quite funny — Ms. Gyllenhaal’s line about sex roles in “the seahorse community” is the screenplay’s one clean satirical bull’s-eye — but there is an unsettling meanness to the film’s treatment of their characters. Burt and Verona are immune from the slightest mockery, which gives the film’s comic moments a bullying, self-righteous tone.  And the pity they show for less obnoxious characters — including Burt’s brother (Paul Schneider) in Miami and some old college friends (Chris Messina and Melanie Lynskey) in Montreal — is flavored with contempt. The human landscape Mr. Mendes surveys (the physical one is shot with understated beauty by Ellen Kuras) is dominated by inadequacy, with a special emphasis on maternal instincts gone awry.  In addition to Lily and L N, there is a mom who has fled and another whose adopted brood can’t compensate for her inability to bear children. And then there is Verona’s sister (Carmen Ejogo), whose boyfriend is such an evident loser that he can’t even make it onto the screen alongside the marvelous Burt.  Not that Burt is boastful. On the contrary, he and Verona glow with a modesty that only adds luster to their many other virtues. Their conversation is carefully poised on the boundary between facetiousness and sincerity, and they do things like turn unlikely words into adjectives by adding the letter Y (Burt wants a “Huck Finn-y” life for their baby) and pretend to argue about the difference between cobbling and whittling.  To observe that they inhabit no recognizable American social reality is only to say that this is a film by Sam Mendes, a literary tourist from Britain who has missed the point every time he has crossed the ocean. The vague, secondhand ideas about the blight of the suburbs that sloshed around “American Beauty” and “Revolutionary Road” are now complemented by an equally incoherent set of notions about the open road, the pioneer spirit, the idealism of youth.  Or something. Really, “Away We Go” is about the flight from adulthood, from engagement, from responsibility, even as it cleverly disguises itself as a search for all those things. But the dream of being left alone in a world of your own making, far from anything sad or icky or difficult, is a child’s fantasy. Not an unattractive or uncommon one, it must be said, and for that reason it is tempting to follow Burt and Verona into the precious, hermetic paradise that awaits them at the end of the road. You know they will be happy there. But you should also understand that you are not welcome. Does it sound as if I hate this movie? Don’t be silly. But don’t be fooled. This movie does not like you.  “Away We Go” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has obscenity and sexual situations.

"Away We Go" reps a digression into loose, anecdotal Amerindie-style terrain after helmer Sam Mendes' starrier, more high-stakes screen projects. But this episodic dramedy -- starring tube familiars John Krasinski and Maya Rudolph as a rudderless couple seeking a place to call home while on the brink of parenthood -- emerges as an oddly sour, unappealing road-trip scenario. Penned by first-time scribes, alt-lit favorites and real-life spouses Dave Eggers and Vendela Vida, pic will likely find some defenders, particularly among the authors' fans. Still, its theatrical career launching June 5 looks to be short, with ancillary prospects modest.
Burt (Krasinski of NBC's "The Office") and Verona ("Saturday Night Live's" Rudolph) are expecting their first child in rural Colorado, a habitat chosen for his parents' proximity. (Hers died in an accident years earlier.) But blithe, self-absorbed Jerry (Jeff Daniels) and Gloria (Catherine O'Hara) suddenly announce they're whimsically moving to Belgium -- no matter that they'll miss their grandchild's birth.
This prompts the younger pair, having no friends, no job obligations (both are long-distance freelancers), to pack up and look for somewhere more suitable to live. They embark on a complicated flight itinerary to see old pals and explore potential new nesting places.
First stop is Phoenix, to see Verona's former co-worker Lily (Allison Janney), husband Lowell (Jim Gaffigan) and their two children. But Lily has turned into such a vulgar, abusive gorgon that spouse and kids have retreated into gloomy withdrawal.
After a brief Tucson visit with Verona's well-adjusted sister Grace (Carmen Ejogo), it's on to another example of domestic hell: Burt's childhood friend Ellen aka LN (Maggie Gyllenhaal) is a smugly superior U. of Wisconsin Women's Studies prof with a fawning, ponytailed layabout common-law husband (Josh Hamilton) and a son who still sleeps with them.
A seg in Montreal culminates in a bizarre stab at poignancy, while a quick Miami side-trip to see Burt's distraught brother (Paul Schneider) prompts the pic's best scene, a quiet tete-a-tete between the leads that sets up the pic's low-key (if a little over-convenient) ending.
Burt's a bit immature, and Verona, the grown-up of the couple, occasionally impatient (partly explained by the discomforts of advanced pregnancy). But the protags are essentially blank slates, despite the skill and charm Krasinski and Rudolph bring to the roles. It's their job simply to represent "normal" against so many illustrations of bad parenting, worse marriages and damaged adulthood. But given they're such harmlessly pleasant folk, why don't they have any non-messed-up friends?
Because that would un-stack the deck in a script that needs to paint them as two lonely souls in a hostile world. But in positing normal as special, the pic requires caricaturing almost everyone else.
While handled by resourceful actors, the foibles of the supporting characters are less funny than they are forced and unpleasant. Janney and Gyllenhaal in particular play figures venomously conceived.
Meant to amp up the pic's indie-quirky cred, the soundtrack, papered with lyrically trite soundalike cuts by Scottish singer-songwriter Alexi Murdoch, instead makes progress seem more meandering and monotonous. Other design/tech contributions are solid. Still, this alternately condescending and hazy material doesn't trigger the kind of sharp aesthetic choices Mendes and collaborators made in response to past projects from "American Beauty" to "Revolutionary Road."
"Away" is billed as the first studio production adopting green filmmaking initiatives to reduce CO2 emissions.

Midway through A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius , Dave Eggers 's solipsistic, terminally-apologetic-for-being-solipsistic portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-slacker-messiah, the author, upon interviewing to become a cast member of MTV's The Real World , makes the following observation about his generation of self-obsessed, media-savvy technobrats: "These are people for whom the idea of anonymity is existentially irrational, indefensible," Eggers writes. "And thus, there is a lot of talking about it all—surely the cultural output of this time will reflect that—there'll be a lot of talking, whole movies full of talking, talking about talking, ruminating about talking about wondering, about our place, our wants and obligations—the blathering of the belle epoque, you know." Not surprisingly, in Eggers's first original screenplay, Away We Go , the characters never shut up.
While I don't doubt—as multiple friends have assured me—that Eggers is a boon to the publishing industry (through his McSweeney's imprint), a dedicated public servant (through his 826 learning centers), and an all-around swell guy, as a writer he has an awful lot to say about not very much. In A.H.W.O.S.G. , the talk sometimes ran on for pages at a time—logorrheic monologues about how great it was to be young; how losing both your parents to cancer was, like, a bummer; and how Eggers himself really, really wanted to change the world without, of course, seeming  like he was anything other than an ordinary, laid-back dude. In Away We Go  (co-written by Eggers's novelist wife, Vendela Vida ), the characters similarly hem and haw about not knowing what they really want to do with their lives and whether, already in their early thirties, that makes them "fuck-ups." (Yes.) Eventually, they romp around the country visiting friends and relatives who are ostensibly more settled down than they are, vicariously trying their lives on for size.
The black hole that is Eggers's navel here takes the form of bearded and bedraggled Burt (John Krasinski ), a 33-year-old insurance futures salesman who disguises his voice when talking on the phone to clients to sound how he thinks a grown-up should. Burt's medical illustrator girlfriend, Verona  (Maya Rudolph ), is six months' pregnant with their first child, but doesn't want to get married—too hip. As Away We Go  opens, Burt and Verona have put down tenuous roots in Colorado to be close to his parents (Jeff Daniels  and Catherine O'Hara ). Then the folks announce that—surprise!—they're moving to Europe, and our young parents-to-be take to the highway, searching for a more meaningful existence.
Thus, away they go to Phoenix for a rendezvous with Verona's blowsy former colleague (Allison Janney ) and her brood of sullen, inarticulate offspring; to Madison , for a reunion with Burt's childhood friend (an amusing Maggie Gyllenhaal ), now a self-righteous earth mother who disavows strollers and proselytizes the family bed; and to Montreal , where a couple of college classmates (Chris Messina  and Melanie Lynskey ) have fostered a rainbow coalition of adopted children. At one point, Messina's character holds forth with a speech about love and stability, using sugar cubes and maple syrup as visual aids. This may be the movie's most purely Eggersian moment—twee, overwritten, and profoundly banal.
These brief interviews with hapless and/or hideous parents are, I suppose, intended by Eggers and Vida as a comic panorama of contemporary child-rearing. Mostly, though, they form a gallery of grotesque family portraits that we can sneer at (sneering being a big part of Eggers's ostensibly all-inclusive aesthetic), knowing that no matter what sort of parents Burt and Verona—and, by implication, those of us in the audience—turn out to be, they/we can't help but be less fucked-up than these freaks.
Away We Go  was directed by Sam Mendes  during a post-production furlough from Revolutionary Road , and, viewed side-by-side, the films form a curious diptych—two portraits, separated by a half-century, of young couples trying to find their place in the world, one adapted from a writer, Richard Yates , who was among the most prescient of his generation, the other from a writer who ranks among the most precious of his. But whereas the Wheelers of Revolutionary Road  had grand designs for themselves­ to make art, to think great thoughts, to live la vie bohème —the road-trippers of Away We Go  harbor no discernible ambitions whatsoever, which may make them true to Gen-Y life, but also renders them fatally uninteresting. For all the ground they cover geographically, dramatically their velocity remains zero. Mendes, too, seems to have trouble getting on board with the underachieving set. His direction here is looser and less starchy than usual, less honorific and Oscar-worthy, but still somehow on the outside looking in. When Mendes takes his camera off the tripod and puts a suite of Nick Drake  sound-alike alt-rock ballads on the soundtrack, it's a bit like watching someone's dad dive into a mosh pit, or a Mumblecore movie made by David Lean . Yet that very disconnect somehow seems apropos. After all, this is Dave Eggers's world, and the rest of us are just living in it.
