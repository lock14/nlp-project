Stockwell (Blue Crush)
 sure loves pretty people in beautiful locales. Here we have Jared (Walker) and Sam (Alba), dive-bum lovers in the Bahamas. Their boat is leaky; they live in a trailer and fantasize about striking it rich from buried treasure. Enter hotshot buddy Bryce (Caan, who�s wrinkly and toothsome like father James), on vacation from New York City with a skanky gal (Scott) and the keys to a legal client�s borrowed mansion on the island. Lurking in the turquoise waters is, of course, a fortune in cocaine submerged by a plane crash � and quite possibly the aforementioned buried treasure Jared and Sam are seeking. But when Bryce gets the gang in too deep (this is, after all, an unofficial remake of 1977�s The Deep
) with the nose candy�s rightful owners, will they all wind up floating? You don�t need me to tell you what the draw is here � the MTV-ready principals undulating in their skimpy swimwear through big-ticket aquatic photography � but Into the Blue
 is better than it has to be. Everyone in this movie is impossibly hot (when we need a gun-toting heavy to menace our heroes, we get supermodel Beckford), but Stockwell draws the net around them efficiently enough, and after a meandering first act, the movie gets down to business as a crisp little thriller. Its characterizations are as bland as sand: As the Good Girl with Integrity, Alba�s always going on and on with "I just want you to be happy. You know that?" even in voiceover when she�s not onscreen, and Caan�s relentless dude-speak is so grating that it�s a pleasure to see him imperiled at sea. Yet the movie works somehow for what it is � a matinee yarn about greedy friends who blunder into a fortune and get their hands dirty trying to grab it. There are, of course, more artful and ethically engaging variations on this theme (A Simple Plan
 and Shallow Grave
 leap to mind), but there are worse ones, too � and this one has sharks and pirate lore and Sea-Doo action sequences, so you can see what its priorities are. The movie�s timing is terrible in that the characters make frequent reference to "that big hurricane that just came through here" (evidently a substantial storm will cause sunken objects to drift enough to be found); it makes the filmmakers look like oafs when really they�re just grasping for plot points to kick-start their bikini movie. And don�t bring the kids. By crawling up Alba�s boy-shorts with an underwater camera, the producers are angling for that elusive adolescent male viewership, but the movie is too violent for its PG-13 rating.


Regarding Paul Walker and Jessica Alba: How do you get a decent performance from a wood plank and a helium balloon? Amazingly, John Stockwell knows: Just add water.
Stockwell's ''Into the Blue" is the most improbable of movies, a comic thriller set in the Bahamas in which Walker and Alba bare enough flesh to seduce us into thinking they've bared pieces of their souls.
They play a couple who gets paid to tool around in the ocean. He's Jared, a diving instructor; she's Sam, a woman who handles the sharks at a local resort. And after their greasy buddy, Bryce (Scott Caan), arrives with the salty gold digger (Ashley Scott) he picked up hours before, Jared and Sam get tangled up with the local drug lord who wants the bricks of powder removed from a plane that crashed into the ocean. Do the divers risk their lives to keep a profitable brick or two? Do they walk away as the upright Sam suggests?
This all sounds typical, and with any young Hollywood hack, Matt Johnson's script would have felt that way, too: 80 rushed minutes of drug pirates, guns, and booty. But somebody at the movie studio has let Stockwell and his two editors take their time. ''Into the Blue" is as much a mesmerizing aquatic expedition as it is a reasonably suspenseful action adventure. The movie contains as many suggestive shots of stingrays, tropical fish, and hungry sharks as it does of Alba or Scott in their bikinis. And Walker is a revelation, gliding like a torpedo from one scene to the next. I realize HBO's ''Entourage" meant its ''Aquaman" movie as a gag, but Walker coolly suggests that it doesn't have to be.
Stockwell lets the Bahamian locations and the North Atlantic Ocean call out to you. The camera zooms down a waterslide, and there are numerous shots of the cast submerged in Caribbean waters blue enough to suggest a dip in Elijah Wood's eyes. All the snorkeling, scuba diving, breath holding, and emergency mouth-to-mouth is sexy. Yet this isn't the standard travel brochure or a Coppertone ad, either. Jared and Sam aren't tourists, at least not anymore. The black locals treat them like members of the community. And the movie catches enough regional color to suggest a bustling awareness that the island is bigger and busier than two American lovebirds. (A buddy of Jared's complains, ''My baby mama harass me for a new weave!")
Stockwell even proves himself amphibious, taking us on one electric trip to a nightclub, where we meet another tremendous specimen: Tyson Beckford, as a neighborhood bigwig and every bit the land shark, with a fat Mohawk serving as his dorsal fin. The story thickens later with a dirty, hairier, but no less alluring Josh Brolin throwing villainous shade.
If we're to care about the curves in the plot, we have to believe that Jared and Sam are truly in love. To this end, Stockwell, just as he did with Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez in the amazing ''Crazy/Beautiful," furnishes us with make-out sessions between Walker and Alba, where the kisses are deep and physical, not the ghastly locking of gears we usually get between two actors. Sam's disappointment with Jared's vanishing scruples feels real. So does his eventual shame at having let her down.
What makes Walker and Alba so pleasurable to watch here -- and it takes a decently made movie to reveal this -- is that neither appears to be a narcissist. They comes alive as the movie deepens. Casting them among showboats like Caan, Brolin, Beckford, and Scott is shrewd: By comparison, Walker and Alba seem like innocent, rather compelling eye candy. And in John Stockwell, they've finally found their Willy Wonka.


         Paul Walker can hold his breath a really long time, or at least his character in the insipid "Into the Blue" can. However, that's nothing compared to how long you'll be waiting for something remotely interesting to happen in this logic-challenged dive-bum thriller directed by John Stockwell, who did the equally silly surf movie "Blue Crush."
 
  Walker, Jessica Alba, Scott Caan and Ashley Scott play friends who discover what might be buried treasure on the ocean floor in Bahamian waters. Nearby lies the wreckage of a plane containing a whole lot of cocaine creating that dreaded ethical conundrum: whom do you root for when everyone is sleazy?
 


         






    The dialogue credited to Matt Johnson consists mainly of "We're outta here" and declarations of intent are usually punctuated by the endearment "Bro." There are also plenty of man-hugs and big-ups (the fist-to-fist greeting of the islands) to keep the testosterone at sufficiently brain-dead levels. Alba and Scott are reduced to eye candy as the camera nuzzles their derrieres from peculiar angles in and out of the water.
 
 "Into the Blue,"
 PG-13 for intense sequences of action violence, drug material, some sexual content and language. Running time: 1 hour, 50 minutes. In general release.   

In the far-off days of the early James Bond films, underwater action sequences had a hip tranquillity  a lyrical zing. They were all about how fast you could move in a world that denied speed. The closest that Into the Blue  comes to that old '60s lyricism is to feature Jessica Alba, in all her tawny, rope-muscled glory, slithering through the crystal blue waves of the Bahamas. Alba and Paul Walker are lovey-dovey Caribbean dive bums, happy to be broke  at least, until the appearance of Walker's buddy, a yuppie oozing frat-house smarm. (Is Scott Caan glad he gets to play these roles? It sure looks like it.) Out snorkeling, they find a sunken plane full of cocaine, which leads to much underwater mayhem and above-water banality. Walker is supposed to be lured by the buried treasure, but the actor, wearing Brad Pitt's bristle cut, is like Pitt with his sexy appetite sucked out.


Not a thriller so much as an extremely violent swimsuit calendar, the lushly lensed but dramatically waterlogged "Into the Blue" is too infatuated with its scantily clad stars to make sense of all the drug dealers, boat looters and bloodthirsty sharks trying to hunt them down. Toplining presence of Jessica Alba -- and her bikini -- will attract goggle-eyed males aplenty, though overall B.O. looks shallow for this late-summer holdover from MGM and Columbia.
When a small plane carrying a lot of screaming foreigners and 800 kilos of cocaine crashes off the coast of the Bahamas, it presents a golden opportunity for amateur treasure seeker Jared (Paul Walker). In a pair of coincidences straight out of 1977's "The Deep," Jared and his friends discover the downed plane and, nearby, a slew of jewel-encrusted artifacts that, if proven to be the remnants of a legendary Spanish shipwreck, could be worth millions.
Jared's classy girlfriend Sam (Alba) wants nothing to do with the coke. Somewhat less principled, his lawyer buddy Bryce (Scott Caan) and blonde-du-jour Amanda (Alba's former "Dark Angel" co-thesp, Ashley Scott) suggest selling it so they can buy the equipment necessary to excavate the treasure.
Apart from a rival treasure hunter (Josh Brolin, looking effortlessly sleazy) and a few sharks circling ominously nearby, draggy first half focuses almost exclusively on the central foursome as their idyllic beach-bum lifestyle slowly gives way to ripples of greed, mistrust and eventual mutiny. But this isn't exactly "Knife in the Water," and since the characters are as thin as their swimwear, the interplay barely merits sustained attention.
If Matt Johnson's screenplay initially suffers from slack pacing, things do pick up in the second half, which piles on plot twists, intros new characters ("24's" James Frain turns up as a menacing Brit), and ups the underwater mayhem exponentially.
Helmer John Stockwell brings the pic to a climactic 15-minute frenzy of violence, cross-cutting roughly but effectively between two parallel lines of action, with harpoons, explosives and strategically timed shark bites all coming into play. Harrowing sequence is surprisingly graphic for a PG-13 rating, though still a minor payoff for a thriller otherwise lacking in tension.
Still, given the abundance of flesh onscreen throughout, auds probably won't be bored. Cinematographer Shane Hurlbut's leering camera angles leave no cleavage unexplored, while the deep-focus photography conveniently allows the odd body part to be unsubtly magnified in the foreground.
Alba, an actress of greater gifts than she's allowed to exercise here, takes the exploitation in stride, though it's Scott, stuck with an irritating and ultimately dispensable character, who is ogled most excessively.
In a role that requires more swimming than acting, Walker is in his element here; at times, he resembles a bronzed mer-god posing for a subaquatic centerfold. Caan gets some of the script's better lines and tosses them off with a loose-limbed wit, but his slackerish vibe doesn't make him persuasive as a New York attorney.
Fittingly, the eye-candy cast boasts an actual supermodel, Tyson Beckford, playing a nightclub owner who figures into the drug rap.
The underwater photography is as luxuriant and sparkling as a Caribbean travel brochure, though imagery veers toward incoherence amid the claustrophobic wreckage of the plane. Pitch-perfect below-the-surface sound mix, meanwhile, suggests a disregard for the laws of physics.

A tides-and-ass adventure for the whole family (minus Mom and Pop and anyone else who isn't an achingly horny pubescent male), Into the Blue  plays like an undersea lecture on the seven deadly sins, with lust, that peskiest of vices and safest of selling points, conveniently grandfathered out of the proceedings. Screenwriter Matt Johnson  offers an atypically preachy tale about the dangers of drug dealing, theft, and unchecked greed, while director John Stockwell  keeps sneaking peeks at Jessica Alba 's eternally wedgied butt crack. Alba plays Sam, the midriff-baring girlfriend of Paul Walker 's boneheaded scuba diver. The pair stumbles upon a plane full of cocaine while searching for buried treasure on the ocean floor. They want to call the police, but Scott Caan  and Ashley Scott  convince them to be mustache-curlingly evil and to keep the find to themselves. Granted, the cast has a certain rumpy charm, and setting four-fifths of the movie underwater keeps the pesky surfer-speak to a minimum, but the film is less about thrills than punishing the wicked. Any potential guilty pleasure is washed away in a sea of icky sermonizing.
