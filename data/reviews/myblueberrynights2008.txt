In his first English-language film, the Hong Kong avant-pop auteur Wong Kar-Wai shoots American dive bars in gorgeous hot reds, and he teases out moments of terrific acting  from David Strathairn   and Rachel Weisz   as a bitter, raging couple, and from Natalie Portman   as a Dixie-broad poker fiend with daddy issues. But Norah Jones  , making her big-screen debut as a wistful wanderer, is a beautiful blank, and the fragments barely add up to a movie. My Blueberry Nights  hints that buried in Wong's spicy odd noodlings may be an even better conventional filmmaker.

 Anyone who has been to Las Vegas, Memphis or New York — or who has received postcards from friends in those cities — is likely to find “My Blueberry Nights,” Wong Kar-wai’s first English-language feature, wildly unrealistic, even though much of it was shot on location in the real-deal U.S.A. The smoky Tennessee juke joint and the cute little Manhattan bakery-cafe look like theme restaurants catering to the tourist trade, and even the highways snaking through the mountains and deserts have the inauthentic glow of rental-car advertisements. Mr. Wong and his cinematographer, Darius Khondji, make America look so pretty that you may have trouble recognizing it.  But to complain about the evident artificiality of Mr. Wong’s variation on the Great American Road Movie, which has shed around 20 minutes since opening the Cannes Film Festival in May, is to risk missing the point. Not only because in post-Hollywood America, as every self-respecting French philosopher knows, the simulacrum has eclipsed the thing itself. But also because  Mr. Wong, whose previous films have occasionally strayed as far from his beloved Hong Kong as Cambodia and South America, has never been especially concerned with verisimilitude. You suspect that he would hire a production designer for his summer vacation slide show. Indeed, that’s pretty much what he has done in “My Blueberry Nights” (the production designer is William Chang Suk Ping). He’s also brought along a few movie stars (Natalie Portman, Rachel Weisz, Jude Law) to make the scenery even more picturesque.  For this director a sense of place is useful only insofar as it conjures a state of feeling, and geographical coordinates are, above all, indices of atmosphere and mood. Whether the rain-spattered alleys and narrow apartment house corridors of Hong Kong in the 1960s — the setting for “In the Mood for Love” and parts of “2046” — are faithful historical re-creations is beyond irrelevant. Or at least it has been to Mr. Wong’s fervent European and North American admirers, who have elevated his couture fetish, his melancholy sensuality and his flair for arresting visual compositions into elements of a major cinematic style.  I am more inclined to think that in his recent work Mr. Wong caters to a persistent appetite for luxury, for an unabashed, free-floating glamour that can be hard to find in movies these days and that cinephiles sometimes feel guilty about craving. To claim his fashion magazine sensibility for the cause of high art is a way of ascribing nutritive value to eye candy. And why not? We all need to eat, and why shouldn’t we eat cake?  Or pie, as the case may be. Forgive the riot of sweet-shop metaphors, but “My Blueberry Nights,” which starts with a time-lapse money shot of vanilla ice cream deliquescing into the glossy fruit filling of a collapsed slice of pie, insists on its own status as a confection. Its governing metaphor may be that gooey blueberry dessert, but structurally it is a three-layer génoise, frosted with moody voice-overs, torchy songs and silky camera tricks and filmed in caramelized shades of orange and red.  Mr. Wong has always had a connoisseur’s eye for physical beauty, in particular for the faces of lovelorn men and women lighted  by neon and photographed in shadow. Here he samples the exquisite cheekbones of Jude Law and the slightly haggard handsomeness of David Strathairn, but his main interest is in petite, full-lipped women in the throes of emotional unfulfillment.  The first of these is the singer Norah Jones, a good sport if not a natural actress, playing a New Yorker who goes by variations on the name Elizabeth. She starts out as Lizzie, in the midst of a bad breakup that leads her, every night at closing time, into a cute eatery run by Jeremy, a soulful expatriate Englishman played by Mr. Law. Of all the pie joints in the world, she had to walk into his.  And then, for reasons perhaps having more to do with Mr. Wong’s desire to explore new landscapes than with anything going on in Lizzie’s life, she walks out again, keeping in touch with Jeremy through postcards Ms. Jones rather affectlessly reads on the soundtrack. (The post-Cannes editing, as far as I can tell, has trimmed back on the voice-over and also on some of the slow-motion melting ice cream.)  In Memphis Lizzie waits on tables and observes the marital woes of Arnie and Sue Lynne (Mr. Strathairn and Ms. Weisz), who dutifully act out a country-and-western song about drinkin’ and cheatin’. Then it’s on to Nevada, where Ms. Portman jolts the movie (though not Ms. Jones) out of its woozy stupor, showing up as a bottle-blond gambler, her bangles and bluster deflecting attention from the depths of her loneliness and uncertainty.  Ms. Portman’s character, Leslie, arriving late in the film, provides a little kick of melodramatic unpredictability. But her engagingly direct performance — as a habitual liar, curiously enough — only underscores how affected and emotionally inert the rest of the movie has been. Ms. Jones, whose diffidence lends her musical performances an air of intrigue and seduction, does not so much fail to act as refuse to try. Her face registers degrees of strickenness and bewilderment, but she is most persuasive when she falls asleep at the counter of Jeremy’s establishment after gorging on pie.  After 90 minutes of “My Blueberry Nights,” which pass pleasantly enough, with swirly, mood-saturated colors;  lovely faces; and nice music, you may feel a bit logy yourself — filled up, sugar-addled, but not really satisfied.  “My Blueberry Nights” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned) for mature thematic material, including violence, drinking and smoking.

As much a trifle as its title suggests, "My Blueberry Nights" sees Hong Kong stylist Wong Kar Wai applying his characteristic visual and thematic doodles to a wispy story of lovelorn Yanks. With pop music sensation Norah Jones floating through the episodic tale as a blank-page heroine striving to overcome the blues, beautifully embroidered pic generates increased interest as it travels from East to West and encounters Rachel Weisz and Natalie Portman along the way, but its ambition and accomplishment remain modest in the extreme. B.O. hopes, at least Stateside, rest much more with romantically inclined young fans of Jones than among Wong devotees.
"Blueberry" echoes the director's biggest hit, "In the Mood for Love," in its moody melancholy, claustrophic settings and highly decorative shooting style. But while the actors' dialogue delivery is perfectly natural, the aphoristic philosophical nuggets Wong favors sound banal and clunky in this context, leaving the film thematically in the shallow end of the pool. Additionally, the road movie potential of the film's second half feel significantly under-realized.
Wong and his co-scenarist, crime novelist Lawrence Block, dig themselves into a bit of a hole during a borderline contrived initial half-hour devoted to the first-stage shock felt by Elizabeth (Jones) after having been dumped by her two-timing boyfriend of five years. Beset by hurt, Elizabeth consoles herself with latenight sweets feasts provided by the obliging Jeremy (Jude Law), the instantly sympathetic British proprietor of a Gotham caf�. 
The establishment's cramped quarters are made to seem even moreso by the shallow focus lensing, which places objects, window writing and anything else Wong and cinematographer Darius Khondji can think of between the actors and the camera, which customarily roves around in search of decorous minutiae. As always, Wong is able to transform anything within his field of vision into something worth looking at, although, strangely, the intense close-ups of blueberry pie and other desserts dripping with cream look more like gross anatomical snapshots than anything you'd want to eat.
Jeremy's almost oversensitivity to Elizabeth's plight and his hyperactive eagerness to please gets old pretty quickly. But interlude ends in a hushed kiss --Jeremy can't resist the intimate possibilities of removing some lingering cream from a sleeping Elizabeth's lips with his own --that removes any doubts of his own interests and sets up Elizabeth's subsequent casual postcard correspondence with Jeremy from various spots on her future journey.
Working as a diner waitress by day and a barmaid by night in Memphis, Elizabeth becomes a sounding board to alcoholic cop Arnie (David Strathairn), who patronizes both establishments, and witness to the death throes of his marriage to Sue Lynne (Rachel Weisz), a faithless floozy who makes a point of flaunting her adultery, but ultimately pours out (in a long single take impressively put over by Weisz) her marital past and true feelings to Elizabeth.
Wong clearly delights in photographing Weisz in glamorized states of sultry disarray, but this proves just a warm up for his treatment of Natalie Portman, who pumps sass and energy into her portrait of a young, frosted-haired gambler who takes Elizabeth, now working as a Nevada casino waitress, for an emotional, financial and automotive ride. Leslie, who learned everything she knows from her gambler father, prides herself on her ability to read her opponents around a poker table and decides Elizabeth has a lot to learn about not taking people at face value. Predictably, the young women find they have something to learn from one another.
After all the effort expended upon elaborating the interior scenes, the film disappoints when it hits the great outdoors of the American West. Frequently speeding up the action of the women tooling around in Leslie's Jaguar convertible and allowing the scenery to flit by fleetingly, Wong seems to take no interest at all in settings that have provided great inspiration to many filmmakers. Reacting accordingly, Elizabeth returns to New York for an innocuously romantic wrap-up.
For all its insubstantiality, "My Blueberry Nights" does provide some catnip allure that will be to some tastes. Best served will be those willing and able to embrace the general void of Elizabeth's character and place themselves within it. Jones proves agreeable but bland company in the role; she's attractive, but lacks mystery, emotional vitality and that something special behind the eyes. As if to make up for this in their scenes together, Law starts off in overdrive and only rarely downshifts; he's more effective when he does so. Cult singer Chan Marshall has a tasty scene as Jeremy's ex back for a quick visit.
Visual beauty is a given in Wong's films, as is the use of pop songs and old standards, and nothing has changed on those counts here. 



Watching Marilyn Monroe  in Cinemascope, a critic once wrote, is "like being smothered in baked Alaska." Reading that as a teenager raised some thrilling questions: Is that good or bad? What is "baked Alaska"? And then a realization: How singular it must be for a woman—or a filmmaker—to overpower with sheer aesthetic witchcraft.
Wong Kar Wai 's adventures in Cinemascope, now a largely abandoned format, began with 2004's 2046 ; by then he had already proven himself capable of reaching baked-Alaska heights of visual force with a body of films (and actors) known for their bleary urban lacquer and radiant force fields of loneliness. And while the opening frames of his latest film, My Blueberry Nights , are flooded with the gooey innards of various pastries, what follows leaves the promise of excess of any sort unfulfilled.
Wong calls Chungking Express , his fourth film but first international calling card, "a road movie of the heart." My Blueberry Nights , his first film in English, has been called an actual road movie, but it's more of a destination film with three settings: East goes West when Elizabeth (Norah Jones ) ditches New York with a broken heart and lights out for Memphis and the gambling hub of Ely, Nevada . The shell-shocked Elizabeth has transformative interactions with the locals—add a poison mushroom and call it Into the Mild —then returns to New York healed and with a great new hat.
But the lovelorn cops in Chungking  traverse a greater distance within the perimeter of the Midnight Express deli and the Chungking House hotel than Wong manages with all of Route 50 here. Having plucked Jones from the realm of adult-contemporary radio on purely aesthetic grounds, it's hard to tell who failed whom: She looks beautiful, if benign, but lacks the magnetic ache that carries Wong heroines through their thinly plotted paces and densely layered close-ups. Jones can't be entirely blamed for having an easier time chewing on day-old prop pastry than some of Wong's lines (he co-wrote the script with Larry Block ). Still, her delivery is oddly behind the beat, a problem of phrasing curious for a musician, particularly as singer Chan Marshall  shows up as a mysterious ex and slays with her inspired utterance of "sen-ti-men-tal."
The story begins in New York, where Elizabeth has a Snapple -throwing shit fit outside of a diner owned by Jeremy (Jude Law ). Elizabeth's ex-boyfriend has recently been spotted in the diner with a new love, and she is beside herself with grief; in the first of a series of heavy signifiers, she hands Jeremy a set of her ex's apartment keys, which he plops into a goldfish bowl full of similar cast-offs. Jeremy offers solace in the form of brisk advice and a slice of the blueberry pie no one ever orders. A series of brief diner encounters ensue, with the sweetness of the couple's exchanges sometimes literally written on their faces; cinematographer Darius Khondji  shoots many of these scenes through the café's window, itself covered in advertisements for the cookies, pies, and cupcakes sold inside.
Elizabeth hits the road with Jeremy's heart half in tow and sends him chaste postcards from the two cities where she ekes out a living for the better part of a year. Wong salutes Tennessee Williams  in the Memphis segment, and while he clearly had a gay old time, the story between Arnie (David Strathairn ) and his estranged wife Sue Lynne  (Rachel Weisz ) feels more like a tangent than a chapter. Natalie Portman  fares better as a troubled poker babe in Nevada, and can fill the empty space Wong leaves, like an ellipsis, in his corner-bound close-ups with something resembling human complexity.
The disappointment here doesn't have much to do with Wong doing America—he's been doing America for years, even in Chinese—but with Wong doing Wong, and not up to his own standard. Toward the end of Happy Together , Wong's other road movie, Tony Leung 's character says, "Turns out that lonely people are all the same." Not quite.
