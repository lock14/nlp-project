         Creditors knocking at your door? Up to your eyeballs in credit card debt? Besieged by offers for even more credit cards despite your inability to keep up with the ones you already have? Wondering how this is even possible?
 
 Filmmaker and author James Scurlock wants to tell you in the timely documentary "Maxed Out," a biting critique of the credit card industry. Drawing on the stories of individuals from across the country, Scurlock etches a bleak view of the state of personal debt while taking aim at the predatory strategies of lenders, the entrepreneurial enthusiasm of collection agencies and the cozy relationships between recent Republican administrations and major financial institutions.
 


         






   Americans, if you haven't heard, are racking up personal debt in record numbers. Reportedly, the average family has more than $9,000 in credit card debt. It seems that it has become a staple of the evening news to rattle off statistics such as these as financial gurus like Suze Orman ply us with promises of money makeovers and admonish us to repent or else.
 
 So while the premise of "Maxed Out" may not surprise, some of the details will. Scurlock connects the dots between major banks and their practices in targeting those most vulnerable — college students, the elderly, the previously bankrupted — and makes a compelling case that something needs to be done. Many of the stories depicted are tragic, and some are plain strange.
 
 For a film dealing with numbers, it's surprisingly nimble, balancing interviews with people who have been personally affected and financial experts, members of the finance industry and even a surprisingly sympathetic pawnbroker. Scurlock does well to counter the more dire aspects of the film with a razor-sharp sense of humor.
 
 The most troubling facet of the world depicted in "Maxed Out" is that it's yet another avenue from which the nation's wealth flows from the poorest to the richest. It's easy to dismiss the problem as one of personal responsibility — especially if you're debt-free — but everyone should be worried about the two-tiered economic structure it fosters, one in which there is no room for a middle class.

 “Them that’s got shall get/Them that’s not shall lose.” That observation from Billie Holiday’s “God Bless the Child” sums up the cynical view of “Maxed Out,” James D. Scurlock’s documentary investigation of debt in America. This scattershot exposé of usurious banking practices examines why the most vulnerable segment of society is victimized by the lending industry and finds a simple answer: It’s obscenely profitable.  Although “Maxed Out” would like to be this year’s “Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room,” it doesn’t measure up. “Enron” was a stronger film because its focus was specific, the personalities under its microscope were outsize, and its story had a beginning, middle and end. “Maxed Out,” which has no narrator, gathers facts, opinions and impressions and tosses them into a blender. And its story is still unfinished.  Because no spokesman for the lending industry would  be interviewed on camera, the closest the film comes to spearing financial sharks is in its bland clips of testimony from a short-lived 2005 Congressional inquiry into banking practices. The glib, well-heeled apologists for legal corporate loan sharking exude the same air of sanctimonious concern  bankers have always cultivated.  The most carnivorous fish in the movie’s net are the young hotshots  at a collection agency who gleefully describe pressuring debtors to pay up by threatening to alert their neighbors and relatives and to publish their names in the newspaper.  “Maxed Out” opens with scenes of a Las Vegas real estate agent showing off new mansions and describing the innovative ways in which they are financed. People purchasing these houses in upscale enclaves with pretentious Italian names, she says, expect to have their gated communities patrolled by guards.  The scene vividly establishes the notion that consumer debt in America is being driven by a grandiose national sense of material entitlement. Robin Leach muses unhelpfully that people would rather dream about lifestyles of the rich and famous than the poor and unknown. As the film drifts from one topic to the next, it throws in images of post-Katrina New Orleans, a televangelist soliciting donations and a yuppie pawnshop operator showing off his stash of Rolexes. Excerpts from an educational film in which a naïve couple are lectured on prudent borrowing by a solemn blowhard named Mr. Money adds a strain of deadpan humor.  The movie is hostile to President Bush, who is shown urging Americans in the wake of  Sept. 11 to do their patriotic duty and spend. Later it is suggested that a law signed by Mr. Bush in 2005 making it more difficult for Americans to apply for bankruptcy was written by MBNA, one of the largest credit companies in the country and a major Bush campaign contributor. Similarly provocative tidbits are scattered throughout the movie, but they remain disconnected.  For emotion the movie leans too heavily on the histories of despairing debtors, some facing foreclosure on their homes, others driven to suicide. We hear the story of one woman who drove her car into a river. The mothers of two  students who killed themselves describe their thwarted campaign to keep credit card companies from preying on  college freshmen.  For all its disorganization “Maxed Out” still  has an impact. The facts speak for themselves. Consumer debt in the United States amounts to more than $2.4 trillion; the debt carried by the median American household is $9,000. When people go into bankruptcy, about two-thirds of what they owe is in interest  and penalties, not principal. In its most provocative historical analogy the movie compares the lending industry’s predatory practices with sharecropping in the South after the Civil War.  There is little in “Maxed Out” that hasn’t been explored in greater depth and acuity on programs like “60 Minutes” and “Now.” Yet its gloomy message still resonates. It is as old as the republic whose Constitution enshrines the pursuit of happiness as an inalienable right: In a nation of financial snake oil salesmen, where the almighty dollar rules, greed usually trumps ethics.

Much like Oscar-nominated "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room," James D. Scurlock's "Maxed Out" earns points for at least partly clarifying the daunting complexities of financial wheeler-dealings that might normally confuse even Wall Street insiders and biz-press commentators. Intelligent, informative and unusually entertaining docu errs only when it yanks too insistently on heartstrings while focusing on worst-case scenarios involving desperate debtors driven to suicide. Pic should generate interest on the fest circuit, and conceivably could connect with venturesome mainstream auds through theatrical and homevid exposure.
With equal measures of righteous outrage and sardonic wit, Scurlock illuminates the dark side of capitalism by examining the worst abuses of the consumer-lending industry. Impoverished rural families are lured into risking their homesteads by taking ill-advised bank loans while naive college students with limited incomes are encouraged to accumulate massive debt by credit-card issuers.
According to at least one on-camera expert, however, the customers most avidly desired by some lending institutions are middle-class folks who have already declared bankruptcy. Why? Because they're the ones most willing to accept draconian interest rates -- and least likely to be granted another bankruptcy judgment.
Harvard Law School economics professor Elizabeth Warren, the most eloquent of the pic's many talking-head interviewees, recalls warning a group of mortgage bankers to be far more selective when it comes to lending big sums to high-risk customers. But her advice was rebuffed, she claims, because foreclosing on unpaid mortgages is great for the bottom line in the long run. "Consumer lending," Warren notes, "is obscenely profitable."
Investigative reporters, predatory debt collectors and a pawnbroker who caters to financially strapped yuppies are among the colorful supporting players in Scurlock's true-life drama. Radio host Dave Ramsey, a Nashville-based, born-again Christian financial guru, draws upon his own experiences as an insolvent borrower while offering tough-love advice to his listeners. ("I've done stupid with zeroes on the end of it," he admits.)
But even the voluble Ramsey occasionally is rendered speechless by tales of woe from overburdened borrowers who worry that, when it comes to maintaining minimum monthly payments, "death will be the only debt discharge."

Goddamn if we didn't have the bejesus freaked out of us after 9/11, but, hey, hallelujah! President Bush  knew just what to say to reassure the citizenry. Travel, go shopping, take the kids to Disneyland , he admonished, raising a battle cry like the puppets in Team America : "Hey terrorists  terrorize this! " Our way of life may have been under attack, but our credit rating was strong, and we were called on to fight back not with guns but funds, brandishing our MasterCards in the face of the heathens. Sacrifice is for commies.
According to James Scurlock , it was this memorable moment of late-capitalist dementia that provoked him to film Maxed Out, a documentary concerned with predatory lending and the American debt crisis, and to write a book of the same name. Scurlock is an unlikely candidate for the job. Inspired by Donald Trump , his first muse, he enrolled in business school with the full financial support of his parents. With the help of a large trust fund, he dropped out to run a successful Subway franchise until another fast-food venture ruined him, and he took up business reporting. That's hardly the resume of a progressive muckraker, and the most revealing fact of his book may be that he continues to do business with Bank of America , precisely the sort of immense, inhuman financial institution whose remorseless profit-mongering he lambastes.
If he hasn't exactly put his money where his mouth is, at least his heart is in the right place. Surveying the culture of debt, Maxed Out  (the movie) goes heavy on the human-interest angle, interviewing such victims of bank harassment as John and Katherine Brown . Residents of Macon, Georgia , both are mentally retarded and survive, barely, in government-subsidized housing. Scurlock illustrates how that makes them the perfect target of companies like CitiFinancial , a sub-prime lender specializing in the exploitation of the very poor, one of the most profitable and sought-after demographics.
The Browns will never be able to afford the high-interest mortgage they were suckered into signing for, nor pay off the "credit insurance" grafted on to itand that's the point. So long as CitiFinancial can collect even the smallest amount of the debt, or better yet late fees, they'll turn a profit. "The credit industry now collects $20 billion per year in fees that didn't even exist 20 years ago, writes Scurlock. "Big banks realized more than a generation ago that they make far more money teaching us to spend  than to save."
Maxed Out the book provides some interesting historical background, profiling the odd careers of Walter Wriston , founder of Citicorp, and Dee Hock , the idiosyncratic creator of Visa International . Scurlock skims over government deregulation of the banking industry, the proliferation of bottom-feeding debt collectors, and the real-estate industry, illustrating how the latter functions as a "debt-delivery mechanism." Fine subjects all, though Spurlock undermines his jeremiad through slack writing and a lack of journalistic thoroughness (the book lacks both index and useful footnotes; the latter are largely reserved for bad jokes). Even so, it's a wiser investment than a ticket bought to the documentary, a slapdash piece of work totally indebted to second-hand rhetorical strategies (the '50s educational film, glib Bush-bashing) and threadbare indignation.
