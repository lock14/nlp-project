Just as 3-D is heralded as the newest old trick in the cinema showman�s grab bag, along comes Coraline
 � the first animated stop-motion feature to be created in 3-D � to remind us that there can be more than mere gimmickry in the souped-up imagery. It�s not so much that Coraline
�s 3-D effects are vividly realistic or eye-catching, but instead, they appear integral to the visual design and enhance rather than overwhelm the images. Writer-director Selick, with his past experience helming James and the Giant Peach
 and Tim Burton�s The Nightmare Before Christmas
, again demonstrates his unparalleled mastery of the phantasmagoric image. Selick adapted Coraline
 for stop-motion screen puppets from versatile author Neil Gaiman�s prize-winning young-adult novel. The storyline is a classic �grass is always greener� fable that perfectly reflects a child�s provenance of whims and fears. Through a hidden door in a wall of the Pink Palace, her new home, young Coraline (voiced by Fanning) escapes into an alternate universe that looks almost exactly like her real one except that she�s met there by her �other mother and father,� who cook and write music and dote on her every desire, unlike her real parents (both parental units voiced by Hatcher and Hodgman), who are too absorbed in their own work to lavish much attention on their daughter and new home. Coraline returns frequently to the enchanting world of her other mother and father, loving everything about this inexplicable place except for the black buttons that are sewn in place of where their eyes ought to be. �Soon, you�ll see things our
 way,� says her other mother, a promise that does not exactly comfort Coraline. Characters from the Pink Palace also show up in Coraline�s alternate universe and perform great vaudevillian acts: Miss Forcible (French) and Miss Spink (Saunders), the actresses from downstairs, and the Russian circus performer Mr. Bobinsky (McShane) and his dancing mice. Selick makes a questionable decision to add a character named Wybie (Bailey Jr.) to the story. He�s a strange boy but potential playmate for Coraline. It makes little sense to insert such a character since Coraline�s escape to the alternate world is primarily driven by her loneliness. When Wybie again shows up at the story�s climax, just as Coraline discovers she must become her own heroine and extricate herself (and the ghosts of a few other lost children whom she discovers) from this ersatz reality, it gives the appearance that he may have been invented solely to provide the film with some �boy content� � a hero to assist the capable damselette in distress. Perhaps fewer secondary characters would have helped the movie�s overall flow. Particularly at the end, when the ghosts of missing children enter the picture, Coraline
 may prove unsuitably macabre for the youngest viewers. Yet your children and you are unlikely to see a film anytime soon that has more of a handmade feel � a value unto itself. Coraline
 (complemented beautifully by French composer Bruno Coulais' score) stays remarkably true to a kid's-eye perspective and dormant fears: The only buttoned-down eyeballs you see will remain on the screen. (See "The Slow Magic of Stop-Motion
," Feb. 6, for an interview with Henry Selick.)



Good news for family psychiatrists across the land: "Coraline" is opening today, which means on Monday they'll have a whole new clientele of traumatized young children whose parents saw the PG rating and thought this was the latest "Kung Fu Panda."
It is not. A darkly invigorating stop-motion tour down the rabbit hole of childhood anxieties, "Coraline" is a movie only Wednesday Addams could love. Well, Wednesday and anyone who loves her; if you have a 10-and-up who's drawn to alt-comics, smart books, dark clothing, and general pop culture subversion, the movie will be his or her Wonderland. (That age group includes grown-ups, of course.)
Still, allow me to repeat: Do not take a 5-year-old to "Coraline" unless your health plan covers therapy. Henry Selick, the mad-genius puppetmaster behind "Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas" and "James and the Giant Peach," has brought Neil Gaiman's 2002 cult novella to the screen with almost all its playful psychodrama intact. This is "The Corpse Bride" with teeth, Bruno Bettelheim retooled for the multiplex, a nightmare of daft and creative consequence.
I really liked it.
Coraline (voiced by Dakota Fanning) is an only child whose parents, writers both, have moved her to a creepy old multifamily house in the middle of nowhere. Flat-headed, blue-haired, sardonic without being a pill about it, the girl is bored, and mother (Teri Hatcher) and father (John Hodgman) keep shunting her aside until they can meet their deadlines. Which, as any writer will tell you, is never.
Guided by a shaggy-haired neighbor boy (a character not in the book, voiced by Robert Bailey Jr.), Coraline discovers a secret tunnel behind a bricked-up door; it quivers like an expectant intestine. This leads not, as you might think, to John Malkovich's head but to a place even stranger: a parallel universe in which her parents are lovely and attentive, flowers talk, and everyone has buttons for eyes. Sounds charming but a sense of unease persists, especially when the Other Mother (Hatcher again) offers Coraline a deal. Sew buttons on your eyes and you can live with us forever.
Gaiman (who last month won a Newbery Award for 2008's "The Graveyard Book") knows exactly what he's about with this fusion of Lewis Carroll and Sigmund Freud, and Selick brings it into the mainstream without sanding off too many of the book's eccentricities. Coraline's neighbors are a delightfully baroque crew in and out of the Otherworld: a spindly Russian acrobat (Ian McShane); two dotty, round actresses (Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French) with an army of stuffed Scotties; a cat that speaks in the superior tones of Keith David.
I only wish Fanning and Hatcher had brought more individuality to their vocal performances. The actresses are fine but only fine, and their broad, earnest nonregional accents are the closest "Coraline" comes to normal. At the same time, neither Fanning nor Hatcher really has to bring the funk, since the characters do it for them.
Scratch its colorful loop-de-loop surface, and the story is both elemental and rare: an epic psychic battle between a mother and her daughter for acceptance, recognition, and space. The Other Mother is eventually revealed to Coraline (and us) as the evil harridan all teenage girls know their moms to be right after they've slammed the bedroom door, but there's a pathos to the older woman's neediness that's unexpectedly moving. Better, Coraline's real mother is proved to be just that: real, flawed, loving.
(Where's Dad in all this? He's a kindhearted doofus, like so many fathers in films and on TV. Since the main drama is between Coraline and her mom, though, he's forgiven, and, anyway, how can you dislike a character who opens his mouth and sings in the voice of John Linnell of They Might Be Giants?)
Selick has opened Gaiman's prose up and daubed it with fantastical hues and skewed visual ideas; the movie's not as complete a vision as "James and the Giant Peach," but it keeps you wondering what's coming around the corner next. "Coraline" indulges us with the sort of visual razzle-dazzle modern family entertainments are required to have, like a funny and surreal production number for the aging actresses (and their Scotties). Yet because the technique here is stop-motion clay animation - an old-world, hands-on craft with none of the eerie smoothness of computer rendering - the film feels warm and fussed-over. It's the product of humans instead of machines. Like its heroine and like its audience, it has a soul.
(A final note: "Coraline" is being released in selected theaters in 3-D. Having screened that version, I'm pleased to say that very few things are tossed, skimmed, poked, or spewed out at the audience, and that, in general, the 3-D technology is used to give shape to the film's world rather than assault us with it. The result is a gentle dimensionality that compliments the film's dark and spiky sense of child's play.)

Kids are unself-conscious geniuses at inventing alternative realities, effortlessly creative universes in which their wishes and fears find full expression. And, of course, adults regularly visit imaginary worlds too, often with psychotherapists as travel agents. Add to those interested parties the millions who love the fantasy-rich literature of Neil Gaiman and those who adore the dreamscape artistry of Nightmare Before Christmas  filmmaker Henry Selick, and you have the audience for Coraline : everybody. This thrilling stop-motion animated adventure is a high point in Selick's career of creating handcrafted wonderlands of beauty blended with deep, disconcerting creepiness.
The story is familiar to those who have read Gaiman's award-winning 2002 book, and appeals to all who previously followed Alice down a rabbit hole or stepped with Lucy through a closet door to visit Narnia. Coraline Jones (voiced by Dakota Fanning) moves with her distracted parents (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman) to an apartment in an eccentric old house. The tenants are similarly unusual. There's a pair of gaga British ladies of the stage (the Absolutely Fabulous  comic duo of Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French), and a Russian circus gymnast (Ian McShane) who's all skinny blue limbs and big blue belly. But Coraline is bored, and feels ignored, until she discovers a secret door in her bedroom. In the way of fearless children, she enters. And in the bizarro world on the other side, she's greeted by her Other Mother (also Hatcher)  an impossibly perfect version of her real parent, better in every way except for eyes that are dead black buttons. There's a more charming dead-eyed Other Father too, and, indeed, more magnificent versions of everyone she left behind—until, that is, the danger behind the magnificence is revealed.
Book purists will be satisfied, even with the movie-only addition of a playmate for Coraline: a yakkety boy whose ''improvement'' in the Other World is shocking indeed. And Selick fans will beam  especially those who seek out theaters offering 3-D screenings. Stop-motion in 3-D, wow! There's magic through the end credits. So don't rush out the exit door.

 There are many scenes and images in “Coraline” that are likely to scare children. This is not a warning but rather a recommendation, since the cultivation of fright can be one of the great pleasures of youthful moviegoing. As long as it doesn’t go too far toward violence or mortal dread, a film that elicits a tingle of unease or a tremor of spookiness can be a tonic to sensibilities dulled by wholesome, anodyne, school-approved entertainments.  Books, these days, often do a better job than movies of parceling out juvenile terror. There is plenty of grisly screen horror out there for teenagers, of course, but younger children are more amply served by fiction from the likes of R. L. Stine, Roald Dahl and Neil Gaiman, on whose fast-moving, suspenseful novel “Coraline” is based. The film, an exquisitely realized 3-D stop-motion animated feature directed and written by Henry Selick (“The Nightmare Before Christmas,” “James and the Giant Peach”) has a slower pace and a more contemplative tone than the novel. It is certainly exciting, but rather than race through ever noisier set pieces toward a hectic climax in the manner of so much  animation aimed at kids, “Coraline” lingers in an atmosphere that is creepy, wonderfully strange and full of feeling.  Its look and mood may remind adult viewers at various times of the dreamscapes of Tim Burton (with whom Mr. Selick worked on “Nightmare”), Guillermo del Toro and David Lynch. Like those filmmakers Mr. Selick is interested in childhood not as a condition of sentimentalized, passive innocence but rather as an active, seething state of receptivity in which consciousness itself is a site of wondrous, at times unbearable drama.  The governing emotion, at the beginning, is loneliness. A smart, brave girl named Coraline Jones, voiced by Dakota Fanning, has recently moved from Michigan to an apartment in a big pink Victorian house somewhere in Oregon. She is at an age when the inadequacy of her parents starts to become apparent, and Coraline’s stressed-out, self-absorbed mom and dad (Teri Hatcher and John Hodgman), who write about gardening, barely look up from their computer screens when she’s in the room. And so, like many a children’s book heroine before her, Coraline sets out to explore her curious surroundings, interweaving the odd details of everyday reality with the bright threads of imagination. She is accompanied  from time to time by a local boy (Robert Bailey Jr.) and a talking cat (Keith David).  Like the best fantasy writers Mr. Gaiman does not draw too firm a boundary between the actual and the magical, allowing the two realms to shadow and influence each other. Mr. Selick, for his part, is so wantonly inventive and so psychologically astute that even Coraline’s dull domestic reality is tinted with enchantment. Her neighbors are a collection of eccentrics whose physical peculiarities match their quirks of character. Upstairs there is a Russian circus artist with the rasping voice of Ian McShane, while below a pair of aging burlesque performers twitter and chirp in the giddy tones of Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders, queens of British TV comedy.  A secret door in the wall, which opens only at night, leads Coraline to a parallel world that  at first seems to fulfill her sad heart’s every desire. The versions of her parents who live there — a queen-bee “other mother” and her agreeable mate — are warm and attentive, and the pink house is a wild wonderland where gardens bloom in moonlight and every visit discloses new amusements. The oddball neighbors are there, in  altered form, to enthrall Coraline with nightly spectacles — a dream vaudeville that will transfix the movie’s audience as well.  The 3-D aspects of “Coraline” are unusually subtle. Now and then stuff is flung off the screen into your face, but the point is not to make you duck or shriek. Instead Mr. Selick uses the technology to make his world deeper and more intriguing. And of course the stop-motion technique he uses, based on sculptured figures rather than drawn images, is already a kind of three-dimensional animation. The glasses you put on are thus not a gimmick but an aid to seeing what’s already there.  And what is there, on the screen, is almost too much to absorb in one sitting: costumed mice and Scottish terriers; glowing blossoms and giant insects. The “other” world Coraline explores is fascinating, but also unsettling. Everyone there has buttons for eyes, like homemade dolls, and if she wants to stick around, Coraline will have to become like them.  This simple, horrifying operation — foreshadowed in the haunting opening title sequence —  unlocks a cellarful of psychological implications. It would be too simple to say that the door in the wall leads directly to the unconscious. Mr. Selick is hardly a doctrinaire Freudian, but he does grasp the intimate connection between fairy tales and the murky, occult power of longing, existential confusion and misplaced desire. “Coraline” explores the predatory implications of parental love — that other mother is a monster of misplaced maternal instinct — but is grounded in the pluck and common sense of its heroine, who is resilient, ingenious and magically real.  “Coraline” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There are many scenes and images that are likely to scare young children.

Eerily inhabiting the netherworld where a young girl�s wildest dreams become her cruelest nightmares, �Coraline� is a dark delight. Although it coarsens some of the details in Neil Gaiman�s popular 2002 children�s horror novel, this eccentric and deliriously inventive fantasy finds stop-motion auteur Henry Selick scaling new heights of ghoulish whimsy, buoyed by a haunting score that works its own macabre magic. Probably too frightening for very small tots, the PG-rated Focus Features toon deserves to be seen in all its bigscreen 3-D glory, but should also achieve family-favorite status on homevid.
�Coraline� may benefit from the added synergy of an upcoming Off Broadway musical (slated for a May 6 world premiere) and a videogame (released Jan. 27) featuring voicework by three of the film�s thesps: Dakota Fanning, Keith David and Robert Bailey Jr. The captivatingly creepy yarn also has inspired an Italian short film, an Irish puppet show, a Swedish play and a P. Craig Russell graphic novel -- not bad for a book that sprung from a series of bedtime stories Gaiman told his daughters in the 1990s.
Like the novel, the film functions as a crafty cautionary tale on the perils of getting what you want, whether it�s a pair of gloves or a new family. Yet the dazzling colors and unhinged imagination of Selick�s visual palette also have the effect of rendering �Coraline�s� fantasy world that much more eye-ticklingly and dangerously seductive.
Small but spunky, with blue hair and stick-like limbs, Coraline Jones (engagingly voiced by Fanning) is an only child who feels neglected by her garden-catalog-writing parents (Teri Hatcher, John Hodgman). The three have just moved into a ramshackle old boarding house whose other tenants include two faded actresses, Miss Spink (Jennifer Saunders) and Miss Forcible (Dawn French), and a Russian acrobat (Ian McShane) who has his own rodent circus.
Where Gaiman tossed off these peculiar supporting characters with deadpan drollery, the pic somewhat ill-advisedly turns them into colorful, almost Busby Berkeley-esque sideshow attractions that are simultaneously dazzling and wearying. Selick�s script also saddles Coraline with a goth-nerd sidekick, Wybie (Bailey), a figure of eventual dramatic importance but questionable comic value.
The film is on surer footing once Coraline unlocks a mysterious door in the wall and finds herself in a parallel dimension that looks an awful lot like home, emphasis on the awful. This haunted house is impeccably maintained by Coraline�s �other mother,� a dead ringer for her real mother, only she�s cheery and attentive and probably smells like cookies -- oh, and she has black buttons where her eyes should be. Clearly, something�s not quite right here. And when the other mother tells Coraline she must live there forever and have buttons sewn into her own eyes (�Soon, you�ll see things our
 way�), the chill is unmistakable.
Coraline�s other mother likes to play games and create twisted facsimiles of real-world people and places; in that respect, she and Selick have a lot in common. While this is Selick�s first toon not produced by Tim Burton (after �The Nightmare Before Christmas� and �James and the Giant Peach�), it�s very much in keeping with that filmmaker�s darkly funny spirit; even the production design bears shades of Burton�s �Beetlejuice.� The use of stop-motion, as opposed to CG or hand-drawn 2-D animation, is inspired; with its slightly stilted, frame-by-frame movements and tactile, stylized puppets, the film never lets one forget that it�s an imperfectly hand-crafted marvel -- a world the other mother herself might have stitched together.
As Coraline and a helpful cat (David) engage their enemy in a battle of wits, the film keeps bursting its stylistic boundaries: A scene set at the outer reaches of this make-believe world harks back to the Looney Tunes classic �Duck Amuck,� and a later sequence brilliantly visualizes the idea of Coraline as a fly trapped in her captor�s web. As a visual experience, �Coraline� is enriched immeasurably by its sophisticated 3-D engine, which is after subtler, more immersive effects -- sweeping camera movements, delineation of foreground and background -- than the mere gimmick of having objects pop out from the screen.
Riffing on her �Desperate Housewives� role with a devious sense of fun, Hatcher (with the help of some nifty character morphing by the pic�s animators) makes the other mother a villain worthy of the many evil stepmoms that have preceded her. But the film�s most indelible asset is French composer Bruno Coulais� score, a feverish singsong concoction that evokes a girl�s everyday boredom as well as the demons lurking just beyond the limits of her imagination. 


If Alice in Wonderland  were retold by the Mad Hatter, it might look something like Henry Selick 's 3-D, stop-motion Coraline , in which the bored, blue-haired 11-year-old of the title (voiced by Dakota Fanning ) travels through the looking glass and ends up in a world that strangely resembles her own—except that everyone has buttons for eyes. Well, that plus the minor detail that Coraline 's rabbit hole is more of a papier-mâché umbilical cord extending from a small door concealed by living-room wallpaper. And instead of a grinning Cheshire cat, here we have a melancholic black stray who speaks—as cats are able to on the other side of that wall—in the distinctive tenor of John Carpenter  sideman, Keith David .
Not that the movie's air of genial weirdness ends there: In Coraline's button-eyed alterna-universe, life is a nonstop carnival, where Coraline's work-obsessed writer parents are transformed into a pair of gregarious playmates, while her upstairs and downstairs neighbors—an eight-foot-tall Russian circus acrobat (Ian McShane ) and a pair of spinster chorus girls (the immortal British comedy duo of Dawn French  and Jennifer Saunders )—are restored to their youthful glory. Instead of slimy, good-for-you Swiss chard, dinner is a kingly feast of oven-roasted chicken, mashed potatoes, and a literal gravy train. And, of course, you can eat as much dessert as you want. Indeed, everything is so practically perfect in every way that Coraline's only regret is the nightly slumber that inevitably returns her to the slate-colored murk of ordinary life. Until it doesn't anymore. Which is when all the enchantments of Coraline's wonderland begin to creak and crack and spill forth their menacing innards.
Based on a 2002 novel by that prince of kid-lit darkness, Neil Gaiman , Coraline  takes root in one of the most primal of children's fantasies—the desire to escape the clutch of parental authority for a life of boundless wish-fulfillment and adventure. And like her many literary and cinematic avatars, from Alice to Dorothy to Jacques Rivette 's Céline and Julie, Coraline soon learns that one must always be careful what one wishes for. This is familiar terrain for both Gaiman (whose original screenplay for the 2005 film MirrorMask  centered around a teenage girl's journey through a grim parallel world) and Selick (whose 1996 stop-motion adaptation of Roald Dahl 's James and the Giant Peach  remains a modern classic of childhood make-believe at odds with grown-up insolence). But so deep run both men's imaginations that Coraline  is that rare case in which familiarity never risks breeding contempt.
Coraline Jones  isn't the pluckiest or most ingratiating sprite ever to take center stage in a children's film, and her (mis)adventures aren't especially novel, but Coraline  is still a consistent splendor to behold. With all of the tools of the 21st-century CGI paintbox at his disposal, Selick (who made his feature directing debut on the Tim Burton –produced The Nightmare Before Christmas ) prefers to dwell in the realm of stop-motion, where he is restricted to those things that can be modeled with metal and latex, balls and sockets, and made to move not by binary code but by human hands. (For a glimpse of the process, stay in your seat for the movie's brief, post-end-credits coda.) That lends Coraline  a wonderfully tactile aesthetic, befitting a story that takes place not a long time ago in a faraway land but rather in a draughty old boarding house in Ashland , Oregon.
Selick avoids using the movie's 3-D canvas for ostentatious "gotcha" effects, instead employing the enhanced perspective the way a painter might, adding subtle details of height and distance that would be diminished in the standard 2-D frame as he slowly envelops us in Coraline 's dueling realities. Best of all, he understands that the most affecting fables are those in which sweet dreams turn out to be trapdoors to nightmares. So enter Coraline  at your own risk, and watch where you step.
