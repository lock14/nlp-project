As their reign at Miramax is drawing to a close, the outgoing powers-that-be at the distribution company must have decided that a Mindhunters
 is a terrible thing to waste, and thus yanked this movie off the shelf where it has been gathering dust for the last couple of years. Whatever the "plan" is for this current release, "entertaining the public" does not appear to be part of the design. Mindhunters
 is an absurd reworking of the Agatha Christie whodunit And Then There Were None
, in which a group of people stranded in a remote location are bumped off one by one while the survivors try to figure out who among them is the killer. Here, a group of tyro FBI profilers are taken by their Langley instructor (Kilmer) to an isolated military compound for a weekend of simulated mind games. But things turn deadly very quickly, and the young, buff, junior G-men and -women realize that they are the hunted as well as the hunters. Go to the head of the class. This group of profilers seem an interchangeable lot, and so little distinguishes one from another that when they start getting bumped off it's difficult to care. If the future of profiling really depends on the quick wits of recruits such as these, our country may be doomed to attack from within. There are numerous points at which the viewer may want to scream at the profilers not to do the stupid things they nevertheless do (don't split up, don't go in the basement, etc.). And if the scruffy-looking Kilmer is what passes for Langley top brass these days, then someone's not doing their job enforcing the dress code. To its credit, Mindhunters
 does feature several inventive death traps that will appease the more bloodthirsty audience members, but everyone else will be scratching their heads trying to figure out why they have again been duped into seeing another unthrilling Renny Harlin thriller.


'Mindhunters," a dumb new action thriller, is what I like to call a pick-off movie. You've seen one before. A group of actors is assembled -- rarely are they more talented or more famous than, say, Christian Slater, who happens to appear in ''Mindhunters." Gradually, whoever or whatever is doing the slaughtering runs through the cast until the actor with the best agent, the most auspicious career, or, in a recent nod to these films' desired urban audience, the darkest skin, slays him-her-it.
The ''Alien" films are classic pick-off flicks. The two ''Anaconda" movies are recent examples. So is ''Wrong Turn," in which Eliza Dushku's bid for survival was like a 90-minute cardio session.
There are moments in ''Mindhunters" -- which has been blowing around Miramax's release schedule like a dust bunny -- when you can feel the burn, too. Such as when the fatless LL Cool J performs a climbing-wall routine in an attempt to save someone from electrocution.
Why on earth is that necessary? A group of eight FBI profiling trainees is dropped off -- by veteran agent Val Kilmer, who's smart to never quite return -- on a deserted island. The place doubles as an instructional facility where the recruits set out to profile the imaginary killer who's slayed a lot of mannequins and dummies.
The killer, of course, is less hypothetical than originally thought, and soon this simulation exercise starts producing real deaths that range from a frozen body shattering to garden variety impaling and decapitation.
The plot thickens after it becomes apparent that the person responsible for the picking isone of them. ''Them" includesSlater (the leader), Mr. Cool J(the outsider and, for our purposes, the black guy), Kathryn Morris (the star of CBS's crime drama ''Cold Case"), Jonny Lee Miller (the English actor with a scary Southern accent), Patricia Velasquez (the sexy Latina), Eion Bailey (the Mark Ruffalo lookalike), Will Kemp (an actual British guy), and Clifton Collins Jr. (the disabled one).
Everybody looks extra guilty, and ''Mindhunters" turns into a grisly round of Clue. Is it Morris in the basement with a blowtorch? Or Bailey in one of the bunks with a vial of cyanide? Not even Colonel Mustard would stick around for the finale.
The man who should keep us from saying ''So what?" is Renny Harlin, whose directing career hasn't been the same since the pirate disaster ''Cutthroat Island" 10 years ago. He puts enough muscle in a few of the action sequences to make you think he might have another ''Die Hard 2" or ''Long Kiss Goodnight" buried in his unconscious.
But I couldn't bring myself to care whether the woman from ''Cold Case" lives, dies, catches or is
 the stinking killer. It's hard to have sympathy for a movie that tosses in the old shower sneak-up sequence or allows its characters to speak as obviously as possible while standing in a pool of red liquid. (''I've got something. I've got blood!").
The movie can't even have campy fun with the foolishness in Wayne Kramer and Kevin Brodbin's script. Instead, the camera work, effects, and editing turn -- lazily -- downright ''CSI." The shot of the plastic ducks floating on a lake is a nice touch. But ultimately that joke doesn't seem to be on any of the characters. It's on us.


         Renny Harlin's "Mindhunters" begins with a deceptive scariness. Two FBI agents and would-be criminal profilers, J.D. (Christian Slater) and Sara (Kathryn Morris), on the track of a serial child-killer, come upon a derelict Victorian hotel in rural Virginia and investigate, discovering a large dining-table set with a child's birthday party frozen in time like Miss Havisham's wedding. There's much detritus strewn everywhere, the place is in shambles, and the basement is full of unspeakable horrors, yet they nab their man — only to discover too late that there's another man.
 
  This sequence has been carefully staged to build suspense and is truly frightening, but it turns out to be a training exercise — and "Mindhunters" turns out to be a thudding dud, crammed with clunky dialogue, bad acting and gruesome but unpersuasive gore. "Mindhunters" will pass muster with only the most undemanding horror fans.
 


         






    Because the two agents have failed their test, so to speak, their surly, macho boss (Val Kilmer) sends them off along with six others, including a Philadelphia cop (LL Cool J) to a remote island off North Carolina for a training exercise designed to put them inside the mind of a serial killer. The seemingly abandoned island community is dominated by a looming, gloomy Streamline Moderne laboratory-dormitory building. Spreading out in front of it in a horseshoe configuration is a closed-down village with typical small-town Main Street venues. In the time-honored manner of Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Indians," the trainees start dropping off like flies in uniquely grisly fashion reflective of their respective fears and weaknesses and according to a time pattern to be decoded by the dwindling survivors.
 
  Writers Wayne Kramer and Kevin Brodbin do make it tough to guess the identity of the killer among the trainees, but there's scant reason to care, so heavy-handed and unconvincing is this movie, a bald, mechanical display of the exploitation of violence, bloodshed and torture and nothing more.
 
  Slater is fine but Kilmer is overly broad in his brief appearance. LL Cool J's considerable presence is wasted, and of the rest of the cast only Morris is able to work up a characterization of any complexity or conviction.

With Deep Blue Sea , director Renny Harlin set the B-thriller bar pretty high. The Finnish auteur who gave us smart sharks (not to mention the most elegantly truncated Samuel L. Jackson monologue on record) now riffs on Ten Little Indians, with each potential victim/killer  a fresh-faced profiler cadet. In Mindhunters  what begins as a routine FBI training session on (naturally) a remote island quickly turns into an unscheduled bloodbath: One by one, the trainees are picked off by a killer who's almost certainly one of them. (Or possibly their mentor, a barely there Val Kilmer.) Given the psycho's methods  elaborate stratagems involving dominoes, liquid nitrogen, creeeepy kiddie music, etc.  one suspects either Rube Goldberg or a video-store clerk. The twists in movies like these have become exercises in schlock math (subtract a character, divide by running time, add a red-herring cliché), and the revelations bring no more satisfaction than consulting an answer key. What does satisfy is the pleasantly becalming presence of Deep  costar LL Cool J. He's fast becoming Liv Ullmann to Harlin's Bergman.

indhunters" is a quintessential Renny Harlin film: a big, dumb, loud action movie. Despite its reliable delivery of jarring plot twists and elaborately staged mayhem, it never quite manages - or, for that matter, tries - to transcend the genre of the B-list thriller. The director of such fare as "Die Hard 2: Die Harder" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master" seems most at home where Hollywood clich� shades into camp parody. The premise is a reimagining of Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Indians" (also known as "And Then There Were None") as Eight Little Profilers: a graduating class of would-be F.B.I. agents is plunked down on the fictional Oneiga Island, an isolated training compound. There they will spend the weekend profiling an imaginary killer known as the Puppeteer. Their mentor, Jake Harris (Val Kilmer, in one of the mad-genius roles that have become his specialty), has set up an eerie simulation of a crime scene as the site of the team's final exam. But when one team member dies in an unforeseeable (and utterly preposterous) fashion, it is clear that the killer they seek is among them, and that the only way off the island is to turn their profiling skills upon one another as the unseen predator picks them off in increasingly imaginative ways. Kathryn Morris, of television's "Cold Case," plays the closest thing the film can claim to a heroine, an insecure but ambitious young woman driven to succeed as an agent because of her sister's brutal murder as a child. (Many of the film's characters are provided with these conveniently traumatic back stories.) LL Cool J (working under his given name, James Todd Smith) has an elegant turn as a cop planted among the profilers for training purposes, but his character soon founders under the weight of implausible twists. Most of the other profilers, including the ringleader, J. D. (Christian Slater), are largely indistinguishable, serving as little more than walking targets for the next outlandish murder scheme. "Mindhunters" has been shelved for two years awaiting distribution by Dimension. Its muddy color palette and largely unknown cast give it the feel of a straight-to-video throwaway, but it may find a cult audience among fans of schlock cinema seeking a giggle and a scream. "Mindhunters" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has strong language, violence and graphic gore.

Filmed three years ago, and set for release more than a year ago, "Mindhunters" proves hardly worth the wait. While a report last summer that Dimension had decided to send the pic direct to vid was premature, its release in U.S. theaters nearly a year after a quiet bow in limited Euro and Latin American territories will likely only delay the inevitably quick exit to ancillary; this ridiculous would-be thriller about FBI profiler trainees trapped in a match to the death will scare up few bodies in theaters. 
To put the release delay in perspective, after finishing their work on this film, co-star LL Cool J acted in 2003's "S.W.A.T." and director Renny Harlin re-shot "The Exorcist: The Beginning."
Harlan may have been hoping that by re-teaming with Cool J (who is also credited here by his proper name, James Todd Smith, and who worked with the director on 1999's "Deep Blue Sea") "Mindhunters" would revisit that thriller's worthwhile conceit of characters trapped in isolation. Instead, the best Wayne Kramer's and Kevin Brodbin's script can conjure is yet another replay of "Ten Little Indians," with an FBI agent going murderously off the reservation and killing his own group.
An apparent raid on a serial killer's house by trainee-agents J.D. (Christian Slater) and Sara (Kathryn Morris) is just a simulation by eccentric teacher Jake Harris (Val Kilmer), driving home the fine points of profiling. Sara and fellow student Vince (Clifton Collins Jr.) are getting signs they won't graduate, while the rest of their class has long concluded that Harris' sadistic pedagogy is just a little too weird for the bureau.
The long-locked Kilmer, on screen for what amounts to a glorified cameo, resembles a late 19th century Parisian artist more than an FBI man, and his last assignment, to send his pupils to an isolated bunker on Oniega Island off the Virginia shore resembles something out of a frustrated novelist's workbook more than a bonafide test.
Joined by Gabe (Cool J), who's said to be with the Philly P.D. and just here as an observer, the crew discovers a tiny island dominated by a concrete structure and a backlot-type set of an all-American town that curiously resembles the town center of Thomas Vinterberg's "Dear Wendy." Harris departs with a warning that they'll soon be visited by "The Puppeteer," a fictitious serial killer they must hunt and subdue.
Team is full of clean-cut guys like Bobby (Eion Bailey), Rafe (Will Kemp) and Lucas (Jonny Lee Miller), with J.D. assigned as leader and Sara joined by another, feistier gal, Nicole (Patricia Velasquez). But next day's class goes lethal quickly, as J.D. is killed, care of a Rube Goldberg-like contraption that would have taken weeks to prepare.
Exploding boats and chemically altered cups of joe kill off more students, all cued by the killer's penchant for leaving watches set at the appointed time of murder. With no ideas in its very little mind, "Mindhunters" soon becomes a document of a sick person's taste for bizarre engineering and gory death, with the assumption that supposedly well-trained FBI agents will simply step into his carefully laid traps.
Conveniently, Sara suddenly blossoms as a true profiler, gradually racking up clues and forming a picture of a killer intent on exploiting each person's weaknesses. The script exploits every tired cabin-fever cliche, including group members pointing guns in each other's faces at a moment's notice.
The script substitutes device for suspense with four suspects -- and one of them twice --appearing to be the culprit at one time or another. The illogic of the situation is so extreme that the final confrontation plays like an afterthought.
Miraculously, Morris emerges fairly unscathed, which isn't the case with her luckless cast members, most of whom have terrible lines, die painfully and are last seen in dreadfully plastic-looking dead person makeup. Harlin seems to have forgotten what made Cool J so refreshingly funny in "Deep Blue Sea," and leaves him stranded with bland, tough-guy scenes. Miller's character makes as little sense as the actor's changing dialect.
Pic's tech work won't be hurt on video. While Robert Gantz's widescreen lensing will lose something in the transition, sub-par production values won't look half so bad. And one can remotely lower the volume button in the living room so that composer Tuomas Kantelinen's bombastic score isn't quite so ear-splitting.

Blind man's ruff: Sappy revenge drama is worst in show
Missing from Unleashed  is every hallmark of good filmmaking, but its most glaring omission is a cliché: Morgan Freeman 's trademark voice-over. Freeman plays Sam, a blind piano tuner who dispenses homilies that, mysteriously, are restricted to the film's dialogue. One particular Freeman pearl"Pianos are a lot like people, you pound on 'em and they get all out of tune"is a guiding metaphor for protag Danny (Jet Li ), who has spent his life enslaved to Bart (Bob Hoskins ), a psychotic Glasgow  loan shark. Bart raised Danny to believe he is a dog, and whenever Bart removes Danny's collarand commands, "Get him!"the otherwise docile Li becomes a deadly kung fu enforcer. After Danny escapes Bart and his cockney crew, he is adopted by Sam and his perky teenage stepdaughter, who teach their noble savage how to be a human.
In desperate need of its own tonal adjustment, Unleashed  awkwardly appends its brief fight scenes to an incompatibly wholesome family drama. Written by Luc Besson , and directed by hack protégé Louis Leterrier  (The Transporter ), the bulk of this cloying dreck concerns Danny's sentimental education, and were it not for Li's intermittent martial arts sequences, this could just as easily have been a vehicle for Tom Hanks . The story slouches toward a vengeful denouement, but when Danny wants to kill Bart, Sam talks him out of murdering his former captor with pleas that sound cribbed from Freeman's unsuccessful appeals to Brad Pitt  in Seven . Danny's restraint is a sign of his newfound humanity and an affirmation of Sam's unintentionally onanistic advice: "Nothing like self-discovery for turning a boy into a man."
