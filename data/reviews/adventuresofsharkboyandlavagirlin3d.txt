It would seem that Robert Rodriguez, who is just back from Cannes where he showed his other 2005 release � Sin City
 � in competition, has come a long way as a director since the release of his first feature, El Mariachi
, in 1992. Yet The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D
 seems more a throwback to his early, homemade shorts than a creative advance for the Austin-based jack-of-all-cinematic-trades, who writes, shoots, edits, composes, and does whatever else he pleases on all his films. His films have always been family affairs too, with wife Elizabeth Avell�n producing all his features and the filmmaker working repeatedly with several of the same actors and behind-the-scenes talent. The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D
 � a title that can�t be spoken aloud without a smile � is a kids fantasy adventure movie that is based on ideas concocted by the filmmakers� then 7-year-old son Racer Max Rodriguez, who also receives co-scriptwriting credit. The characters and much of the imagery is certainly inventive. But the film is so flighty and simplistic that Racer�s parents would have done better to include more adult intervention in the storytelling. Ideas and images flit momentarily into view before they�re abandoned just as quickly for some other notion that�s shinier and newer. There�s not much to the story: A kid named Max (Boyd) has a very active dream life to compensate for being bullied at school and worrying about his parents� fragile marital state at home. Sharkboy (Lautner) and Lavagirl (Dooley) are Max�s creations, and everyone at school razzes him about his imaginary friends, but when the pint-sized superheroes show up in his classroom (presided over by Lopez as the teacher) to carry Max back with them to their home on planet Drool (it�s so cool, you drool), he makes believers out of them all. Swept away to Drool in an Oz-like tornado, Max and the kids enter the world of 3-D. It�s here that most of the film�s imaginative characteristics understandably come into play. Cinephiles will have fun viewing the results of all the technology and green-screen work, and kids should have fun with the take-home 3-D glasses, but the advances are not really dimensional improvements. Like other 3-D work (not to mention his own in Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over
), the neato stuff and the fun puncturing of fourth-wall conventions is balanced by the awkward prismatic effects of the red-blue glasses and the putting them on and taking them off, etc. Characters hurl chunks at the screen with amusing frequency, and several set-pieces dazzle, but on the whole, little about Rodriguez�s 3-D is novel. As the three kids travel across Drool on the Train of Thought, through the Stream of Consciousness, toward the Land of Forgotten Dreams, what make the strongest impression are some of these cute little throwaways. The acting is generally amateurish and clunky, and so is the pace, which moves from one concept to the next at a speed that leaves them all half-baked. It is in this respect that Sharkboy and Lavagirl
 most resembles Rodriguez�s early home movies, which are cast with his extensive brood of school-age siblings and brim with the gee-whiz discovery of film wizardry. Script-wise, the film dutifully harps on the importance of dreams and believing in oneself, but it is painfully repetitive and something that is proclaimed more than demonstrated. (However, I find it most curious that Austin filmmakers Rodriguez and Richard Linklater in Waking Life
 both have now made movies about dream life.) The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D
 is a strange Hollywood film, but for a home movie it�s one bang-up job. (See http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2005-06-10/screens_feature.html
 for an interview with the actors who play Sharkboy and Lavagirl.)



When this critic was a very young movie geek growing up in Brookline, he remembers going to Saturday matinees at the Coolidge Corner Theatre to see all the old gimmick films: 3-D movies, William Castle schlockers, B-level horror flicks during which some poor, underpaid usher had to stalk up and down the aisles dressed as the Creature From the Black Lagoon. In every case, I and my buzz-cut friends came away crestfallen. Once again we had been promised magic, and once again we had been sold snake oil.
''The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D" proudly upholds this tradition.
The latest project from Robert Rodriguez, creator of the ''Spy Kids" franchise when he's not sawing people's limbs off in ''Sin City," ''Adventures" sounds like a grand old time -- a hip fusion of Nickelodeon attitude, the wittier children's books, and retro kitsch culture. In fact, it's a nearly unwatchable combination of the worst elements of all three. One could forgive a budget this threadbare, performances this amateurish, a plot this tortuous if the 3-D effects passed the cool test. Sadly, watching ''Adventures" is an experience akin to seeing the world through dung-colored glasses.
It begins promisingly enough, with a dark, funny Tim Burton-esque prelude outlining the origins of Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner), a marine biologist's son who's taken in by sharks and who eventually grows fins and jagged teeth of his own. The 3-D effects click here because the shots are clean and spacious, but too quickly we're back in two-dimensional land, in the classroom of spacey young Max (Cayden Boyd), who has dreamed up Sharkboy and his superhero partner Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley).
Max is ordered to stick to reality by his teacher, Mr. Electricidad (comedian George Lopez) and bullied by nasty Linus (Jacob Davich), who swipes and defaces his dream journal. His parents (David Arquette and Kristin Davis) are on the verge of divorce, since Dad's a hapless dreamer, too. Then Sharkboy and Lavagirl drop into the classroom to whisk Max away to their home on Planet Drool, which is endangered by a black cloud of Reason, or Un-Dreaming, or something. Back on go the red and blue cardboard glasses as Max and his friends battle Mr. Electricity (Lopez again, his face CGI'ed onto a Reddy Kilowatt body) and try to cross the Sea of Confusion and the Stream of Consciousness on the Train of Thought. Their goal: the Dream Lair.
In other words, what we have here is a parboiled stew of influences, from ''The Phantom Tollbooth" to ''The Wizard of Oz" to such half-forgotten oddities as the 1953 Dr. Seuss film ''The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T." and the 1986 Jim Henson/David Bowie misfire ''Labyrinth" to every multi-level video game your kid has ever played. Not surprisingly, the plot comes from Rodriguez's 7-year-old son, Racer, who gets a story and screenwriting co-credit with dad. This is awfully sweet. It's also the cinematic equivalent of listening to someone else's child read his collected works. Look, my kids are geniuses too, but I don't let them write the reviews.
Even a forced follow-your-dream allegory is better than none, of course, but Rodriguez hasn't helped matters with the casting. Young Boyd is fine, but the dueling Taylors should be sent back to the minors; as Lavagirl, Dooley plants a fake junior-miss smile on her face that looks ready to crack to pieces by the end. Even so, they're more bearable than Lopez, who, remarkably, is able to overact using just his face.
It's the failure of the 3-D sequences that rankles this ex-matinee junkie most deeply. Rodriguez has chosen the ''anaglyphic" format that will allow ''Adventures" to get into the most theaters; with the red-and-blue glasses, you can show it anywhere, whereas the superior polarized process requires a special mirrored screen. The problem is that red-and-blue glasses filter out all hues except a muddy brown. On the evidence here, Planet Drool should have been called Satellite Crud.
There's one pleasant upshot: You emerge from the movie eager to embrace the lush, colorful, three-dimensional specificity of the real world. I somehow doubt that was the intent. 


         In return for a little patience with the 3-D glasses and some protracted retinal strain, Robert Rodriguez's "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D" offers a retooled "Wizard of Oz" story elaborately re-imagined as a green screen dream.
 
  "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D" was based on characters created by Rodriguez's 7-year-old son, Racer, which might explain why the symbolism tends to meander a little. (Do 7-year-olds read reviews? Because that felt weird.)
 


         






    "Sharkboy's" message — believe in your dreams, hold on to your dreams, learn to dream with your eyes open, don't stop believing, etc. — feels like pure dad, though. It's a George Lucas message, a word of comfort to geeky boys who prefer the safety of simulated worlds and possess the means to create them.
 
  Max (Cayden Boyd) is a sad and dreamy boy who copes with problems at home and at school by retreating into a dream world he accesses by sleeping. Given that his parents, played by Kristin Davis and David Arquette, squabble incessantly, and that faux-hawk sporting bully Linus (Jacob Davich) taunts him mercilessly, it's no wonder Max is a champion napper. In his sleep, he escapes to Planet Drool, a lavender and gray 3-D Eden of milk-and-cookies landscapes, talking bubbles, roller-coaster rides and more terrible puns about the subconscious than you'd hear at a Friar's Club roast of Sigmund Freud: There's a Train of Thought, Stream of Consciousness and a literal brainstorm.
 
  Max's friends Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley), a confident pair of pre-adolescent superheroes, roam the baked goods together. Sharkboy, a little tough guy with fins, gills and bolt-cutter teeth, was raised by sharks after losing his father in a maritime disaster. Lavagirl, a violet-haired beauty made of molten rock, longs to know her true identity.
 
  After Max is told twice in one day, by his mother and his bumptious but affable teacher, Mr. Electricidad (George Lopez), to start living in the real world, Sharkboy and Lavagirl crash through the windows of his classroom in a tornado, whisking him off to save their planet.
 
  Drool has been taken over by the evil Minus (Linus in a Count Chocula get-up) and Mr. Electric (Lopez's face in what looks like an antique scuba helmet, with electrical currents for limbs). On Drool, the trio must find the Ice Princess (Sasha Pieterse), possessor of an ice crystal capable of freezing time, and Max must learn to dream with eyes open, in order to wrest his own imagination back from the clutches of hardened pragmatists.
 
  "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D" is bizarre and (if you can endure the glasses) visually interesting enough, and the script refreshingly free enough ("Wizard of Oz" cribbing aside) of pop culture references and stock characters, that on the whole it feels genuine. Lautner and Dooley are compelling as the sullen, instinctual Sharkboy and the radiant, hot-headed Lavagirl, and it's easy to see why they dominate shy, hesitant Max's dreams. But their hermetic planet has nothing on Max's lush and humid Texas, which, though glimpsed briefly, is as vividly haunting and eerily familiar as a thrillingly ominous dream.

For any other 7-year-old who invents a story about a boy who's half-Jawsy and a girl who flings molten matter from her fingertips, Crayola would be medium enough to tell the tale. But Racer Max Rodriguez isn't any other 7-year-old: His antic father, Robert Rodriguez, is a home-basement sorcerer. Bringing his boy's doodles to life and adding the toothless adult advice never to give up on one's dreams, Racer Max's dad has created The Adventures of SharkBoy and LavaGirl in 3-D , a strenuously merry, digitally produced folly that cavorts weakly like a parent over-involved in his kid's playtime.
Actually, Papa Rodriguez  also known as the director of Sin City  and the more effortlessly charming Spy Kids  series  would be quick to point out that SharkBoy  is a family project, with kin popping up all over the credits. Indeed, that amateur quality is the look the movie is after. Adult actors David Arquette, Kristin Davis, and George Lopez bluster like big sillies, but they don't stop Max (Cayden Boyd) from joining his mutant pals (boy-named Taylor Lautner as the one with the shark skills, girl-named Taylor Dooley as the other with the volcanic talents) as they scamper around on the planet Drool.
Cardboard 3-D glasses add a retro touch, never mind that 10 digital-effects companies shared the high-tech workload, including Rodriguez's own Troublemaker Studios. Like choral singing and travel photography, this adventure is more fun for participants than it is for spectators.

 There's a reason children aren't allowed to vote, drive or make movies with multimillion-dollar budgets. Lively and imaginative as their inner worlds may be, the very young still lack the discipline and maturity to shape them into coherent and compelling stories - a task the director Robert Rodriguez ("El Mariachi," "Sin City") also fails to accomplish in this film based on characters and themes created by his son, Racer Max, when he was 7.  The movie's hero, also named Max (Cayden Boyd), is a 10-year-old boy growing up in an unnamed Texas town, where his parents (Kristin Davis and David Arquette) argue about money, while his fellow classmates look for excuses to beat him up. Max is the kind of lonely underdog kid audiences are supposed to root for, but his whiny voice and prissy attachment to his leatherbound "dream journal" sort of made me want to beat him up, too.  Max's stern teacher, Mr. Electricidad (George Lopez) discourages the boy from writing in his journal about the imaginary superheroes who visit Max in his daydreams. But when two of Max's creations, Sharkboy and Lavagirl (Taylor Lautner and Taylor Dooley), show up to beg for Max's help in saving their home planet, our hero realizes the importance of dreaming (a lesson reinforced by plenty of wooden, redundant dialogue and several grating songs.)  Halfway through, the film turns into a muddled quest narrative, in which Max and his companions must locate a magical jewel called the Crystal Heart to save Planet Drool from extinction at the hands of the evil Mr. Electric (also played by George Lopez). The plot is full of logical holes (early on, Sharkboy and Lavagirl demonstrate an ability to fly; later, they cling to a crumbling bridge, terrified of falling). But more important, Mr. Rodriguez seems unsure what his film is really about, making the moral of the story - "dream an unselfish dream" - feel more like a vaguely judgmental homily than a satisfying conclusion.  "Sharkboy and Lavagirl" is Mr. Rodriguez's second experiment in three-dimensional filmmaking, after the third installment of his "Spy Kids" series, "Spy Kids 3D: Game Over." Upon entering the theater, each viewer receives a pair of cardboard 3-D glasses, to be worn and removed at intervals throughout the movie as various objects (bubbles, wads of paper, fists) are hurled our way. This system worked well enough at the adults-only preview screening I attended, but fumbling with multiple pairs of glasses could get cumbersome in a dark theater filled with squirming children.  "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some very mild bodily-fluid humor, but no swearing or sexual situations.

Nimbly executing another of his career-defining 180-degree turns, multihyphenate filmmaker Robert Rodriguez moves from the graphic-novel noir of "Sin City" to the family-friendly friskiness of "The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D." Latest eclectic concoction from the Austin-based auteur skews even younger than his "Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over," so there's little chance of grabbing teens (or even many tweens) during summertime playdates. Still, small fry will be enchanted by this rambunctious action-adventure, and parents may appreciate the alternative to more Forcefully violent warm-weather fare. Pic should perform decently in its theatrical run, and swimmingly on homevid. 
Whimsical script -- reportedly based on collaboration between the filmmaker and his 8-year-old son Racer -- strikes a nice balance of gee-whiz fantasy and tongue-in-cheek humor.
Prologue introduces Sharkboy (initially played by another Rodriguez offspring, Rebel Rodriguez) as a plucky youth who's adopted by talking sharks after being separated from his scientist father during a marine lab disaster. In a triumph of nurture over nature, the youngster gradually assumes characteristics of his adoptive family -- and even sprouts a dorsal fin.
Accompanied by Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley), an equally plucky young femme who emits leaping flames and volcanic rocks, a slightly older Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner) seeks aid from Max (Cayden Boyd), a 10-year-old daydreamer who's mercilessly teased by bullying classmates, and whose squabbling parents (David Arquette, Kristen Davis) appear headed for divorce court.
According to Sharkboy and Lavagirl, Max invented them in stories he writes. The fanciful fiction has become reality. But, Max also invented Planet Drool, a distant world now in danger of being overwhelmed by forces of darkness. It's up to Max, with help from Sharkboy and Lavagirl, to visit Planet Drool and provide a happy ending.
Once again employing abundant blue-screen wizardly and state-of-art high-def vid technology, helmer Rodriguez drops his actors into a fantastical realm of cartoonish surrealism. It's a wild wonderland where bloodhounds are shaped like electrical plugs, roller coasters run nonstop -- much to the exhaustion of trapped passengers -- and conveniently speedy vehicles are always just a brainstorm away from materializing.
As they traverse Planet Drool, the three heroes hitch a ride on a high-flying Train of Thought, float along the Stream of Consciousness, wander across the Land of Milk and Cookies -- and ultimately reach the dark tower of the Dream Lair to confront Minus (effectively nasty Jacob Davich), a control-freakish fiend who bears a suspicious resemblance to the cruelest of the earthbound bullies who regularly torment Max.
Similarly, George Lopez plays Mr. Electric, a Minus minion who looks like a really mean alarm clock, and Mr. Electricidad, Max's science teacher.
Much as he did in his "Spy Kids" trilogy, Rodriguez brings an impish sense of play and cunning showmanship to this effort. Special effects appear at once playfully cheesy and intricately sophisticated, reinforcing the overall impression of "Sharkboy and Lavagirl" as an elaborate home movie fairy tale produced by a child-prodigy computer whiz.
Unfortunately, the pic was shot in the relatively primitive anaglyphic process, which requires the audience to watch action through cardboard glasses outfitted with red and green filters, rather than the virtually transparent Polaroid filters developed for recent 3-D pix. (Rodriguez used the same retro technology for "Spy Kids 3-D.") The tinted filters seriously compromise, and in many cases dim, the bright colors of Planet Drool. While the plot pivots on the threat of encroaching darkness, some scenes are too murky by half.
Still, "Sharkboy and Lavagirl" remains a spirited romp guaranteed to engross even the most attention-deficient pre-teens. Perfs by the three young leads are winningly sincere and unaffected. As Mr. Electric/Mr. Electricidad, Lopez (who also voices two other characters) is just broad enough. (He's clearly having the most fun as the high-voltage villain who feels the need to "explain" every bad pun he makes.)
Arquette and Davis are oddly tentative as Max's parents, but not so much that they get in the way.

Touting Sin City  at Cannes , Robert Rodriguez  claimed that small budgets accord him greater creative freedom. Maybe so. But most directors would think twice before spinning a screenplay out of their children's personal fantasies, and The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D  is essentially an elaborate show-and-tell presentation. Based on characters created by Rodriguez's then-seven-year-old son, Racer Max, the film doesn't belong in wide release. It belongs on a refrigerator door, alongside "100%" spelling tests, old lunch menus, and notices from the PTA.
It's too early to write off young Racer Max, who, based on the subject matter, might be a budding surrealist. Adventures charts the part-dream, part-reality voyage of 10-year-old Max (Cayden Boyd ), spirited away from the classroom bully during a Wizard of Oz  twister and taken to Planet Drool, a Seussian wasteland controlled by the sinister Mr. Electric , who looks a lot like Max's teacher Mr. Electricidad (both are played by George Lopez ). Max's allies are Sharkboy (Taylor Lautner ) and Lavagirl (Taylor Dooley )naturally, a boy raised by sharks and a girl who spews lavawho guide Max through his subconscious and teach him to use daydreams as weapons. If only Rodriguez himself weren't sleepwalking. His most inventive pop-up effects were already used in Spy Kids 3-D , and the cardboard glasses, refracting the imagery through a headache-inducing prism, only make the sets look cheaper. Inspiration often strikes in unlikely places, but here's a movie where, quite literally, no one looked further than the backyard.
