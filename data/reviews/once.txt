         Do you believe in magic? Do you think small can be beautiful? Are you looking for a little film you can make your own, an enchanting, unpretentious blend of music and romance you can watch forever? If you do, "Once" is about to come into your life and make it whole.
 
  The deserving winner of the world cinema dramatic audience award this year at Sundance, this Irish film is low-key in concept — "a simple, classic story of two artists falling in love" says writer-director John Carney — and thoroughly winning in execution. Its tone may be sweet and gentle, but it has the grit to resist going exactly where you'd expect it to. And it's the first film in years to mix music and story in a light-on-its-feet way that calls to mind Richard Lester's much faster-paced Beatles classics.
 


         






    "Once" not only has a ton of melodic singer-songwriter music from Glen Hansard, lead singer of the Irish group the Frames, and Marketa Irglova, a young Czech musician he's collaborated with, it's also got the bottled in bond naturalness of these two as its stars. Which was not at all the way the film was supposed to go.
 
 Filmmaker Carney, himself a former member of the Frames, first thought of using Hansard only for his songwriting skills but at a certain point realized that the singer, who had a small role in Alan Parker's "The Commitments," would be a better choice than more polished professionals.
 
  Both Hansard and the remarkably poised Irglova, who was only 17 when "Once" was shot, bring an unforced intimacy to the film that is one of its strengths. Seeing their characters interact during the pivotal week they get to know each other is to be in the privileged position of eavesdropping on some of life's smallest but most memorable moments. We invest in these people completely, and they do not let us down.
 
 Having musicians for stars enables Carney to fulfill the ambition he had for "Once," which was to make a kind of covert musical a film that "while not a traditional 'musical' (in the 1940s sense of the term) would still use a number of songs" to tell an involving boy-meets-girl story.
 
 With the able collaboration of cinematographer Tim Fleming, Carney has come up with different visual ways to casually present each song. There are scenes in rehearsal spaces, recording studios, music stores and more.
 
 One of "Once's" best songs, "If You Want Me," is heard as Irglova's character, wearing PJs and bunny slippers, is heading home from a visit to the neighborhood convenience store to get batteries for the portable tape recorder she is listening to.
 
 But that's getting ahead of the story. "Once" opens with Hansard's nameless busker, or street musician, singing his heart out on the streets of Dublin. He is earnest and seemingly completely ordinary, and he spends his days singing other people's songs for spare change. But at night he busts out with the lyrics he wrote himself, and it is then that he attracts the attention of Irglova's equally nameless young woman.
 
  A Czech immigrant who speaks English with an accent, the woman is also a street vendor, selling flowers or newspapers to make ends meet. She is also forthright, occasionally profane, and unblinkingly inquisitive in a way that unnerves the singer. He must have written that particular song for a woman, she insists, "you play this marvelous song to get her back."
 
 The singer in fact has just broken up with his girlfriend, and is back living with his father and helping him repair vacuum cleaners, or Hoovers as they are known in this part of the world. Quite by chance, the woman has a vacuum that needs fixing, and when they take the bus to the repair shop the next day, he gives her his back story as he sings about being "a broken-hearted Hoover fixer sucker guy."
 
  It turns out that the young woman is an accomplished musician herself, a pianist whose only chance to play is lunchtime on demo models at a piano showroom. The singer comes to hear her, and is so impressed that he immediately asks if she wants to collaborate right then and there on one of his tunes. Watching them slowly piece together the achingly beautiful "Falling Slowly" is simply magical.
 
  While all of this may sound forced on paper, it does not play that way on screen for a pair of interlocking reasons. For one thing, "Once's" inevitably romantic plot is modern enough to shrewdly avoid ever playing out the way audiences will anticipate. For another, the music is so rich and completely satisfying and the characters so appealing "Once" makes us believe that this is all happening right in front of our eyes. We fall for each of these young people at the precise moment they are falling for each other, and what could be better than that?

Just about everyone with a heartbeat has had this tingly experience. You're at a movie, and a song, as if by magic, breaks through the surface of the drama. Suddenly, you're no longer sitting and watching  you're soaring. That's the feeling you get at the 1954 A Star Is Born , or at Moulin Rouge , and you can get it, as well, from naturalistic movies that are built like musicals, such as Nashville , Saturday Night Fever , or Sid & Nancy . But until Once , which was written and directed by John Carney, I'm not sure that I'd ever seen a small-scale, nonstylized, kitchen-sink drama in which the songs take on the majesty and devotion of a musical dream.
On the sidewalks of Dublin, a 30ish fellow (Glen Hansard) strums a guitar with a worn-out hole where the pick board should be. His face would look cherubic if it weren't swathed in an orange beard, and he sings with a fervor that might make your average street musician blush. Most folks pass him right by, but one girl (Markéta Irglová), shy yet with a disarmingly open smile, lingers, attracted by his braying passion. Once  tells the deceptively simple story of how these two (we never learn their names) are drawn, over a few days, into each other's orbit, a romance  or is it?  played out in the songs they sing together.
Early on, they go to a musical-instrument store, where the girl, a Czech immigrant in her early 20s, likes to play the piano (she can't afford one herself). He teaches her one of the songs he wrote and hopes to record professionally, and as they begin to play, with him singing ''I don't know you/But I want you/All the more for that,'' the scene becomes a shimmering reverie of love at its birth. Is this what they feel? What they hope to feel? Or is it just an exalted moment of harmonic bliss? That we don't entirely know  and that they don't know either  is part of what's so touching about it, and the beauty of the number, the way that the voices blend and soar, building and stretching the words into a sustained cry, makes it seem as if time itself is standing still.
Hansard, a member of the Irish group the Frames, wrote the movie's songs, and they are softly gorgeous odes to troubled hearts  what emo promises and (to my ears) never delivers. Away from the piano and guitar, Once  moves with the dartingly unresolved, clear-eyed spirit of a French New Wave film. The girl, it turns out, has a daughter, plus a husband in the Czech Republic; the guy has an ex in London he may still love (their relationship is captured in a home-video montage that's like a mini operetta). Instinctively, we want to see Hansard, with his tender bluster, and Irglová, all watchful innocence, save each other; Once  plays off that desire, then peeks behind it. Away from the music, the two are caught in a limbo of doubt and expectation. Yet when Irglová, singing with a demo she's listening to on headphones, walks down a street luxuriating in the percolating sadness of ''If You Want Me,'' or the two of them, in the recording studio Hansard has rented for a weekend, give themselves over to the syncopated yearning of ''When Your Mind's Made Up,'' the movie swoons, and you will too.

 Periodically — about twice a year, by my calculation — someone tries to breathe new life into the movie musical by putting together a lavish song-and-dance spectacle like the ones they used to make, full of big numbers and bigger emotions. (See, most recently, “Dreamgirls” and, before too long, “Hairspray.”) Against this trend, “Once,” a scrappy, heart-on-its-sleeve little movie directed by an Irishman named John Carney, makes a persuasive case that the real future of the genre may lie not in splashy grandeur but in modesty and understatement.  Filmed with more efficiency than elegance on the streets of Dublin, Mr. Carney’s movie, a favorite at Sundance earlier this year, does not look, sound or feel like a typical musical. It is realistic rather than fanciful, and the characters work patiently on the songs rather than bursting spontaneously into them. But its low-key affect and decidedly human scale endow “Once” with an easy, lovable charm that a flashier production could never have achieved. The formula is simple: two people, a few instruments, 88 minutes and not a single false note.  And this is true even if the main style of music is not quite your thing. The principal male character (Glen Hansard) — neither he nor his female counterpart (Marketa Irglova) are given names — is a street musician who favors the wailing-white-man-with-a-guitar mode of folk pop. His songs, full of ringing open chords and vague lyrics, are earnest and self-dramatizing. Their subject seems to be heartbreak, which he has recently suffered at the hands of a straying girlfriend who now lives in London.  This information is extracted from him by his new friend, a young Czech woman whose forthrightness he  finds irritating at first. He fixes her vacuum cleaner (his day job is working in his father’s repair shop) and makes a half-hearted, bluntly rejected pass. But while there is an evident spark of attraction between them — Ms. Irglova’s teasing directness works beautifully with Mr. Hansard’s shuffling sincerity — “Once” is far from a conventional love story. It is, instead, the story of a creative partnership that develops by chance and that involves a deeper, riskier bond than mere sex ever could.  She, it turns out, is a musician as well, a classically trained pianist with an interest in songwriting. Her professional prospects are, if anything, less stellar than his, since she lives in a small apartment with her mother and small daughter and supports herself by cleaning houses and selling flowers on the street. But she responds to his songs and is happy both to sing harmony and to write lyrics for one especially challenging tune.  It seems silly and grandiose to lavish praise on a movie whose dramatic crux is the recording of a demo tape, and there is some danger that the critical love showered on “Once” will come to seem a bit disproportionate. It is not a film with any great ambitions to declare, or any knotty themes to articulate. It celebrates doggedness, good-humored discipline and desire — the desire not only to write a song or make a recording, but the deeper longing for communication that underlies any worthwhile artistic effort.  The special poignancy of the movie, the happy-sad feeling it leaves in its wake, comes from its acknowledgment that the satisfaction of these aspirations is usually transient, even as it can sometimes be transcendent.  Neither Mr. Hansard, who fronts a band called the Frames, nor Ms. Irglova is an established professional actor, though both are gifted composers and performers. Their guilelessness protects the movie from its sentimental impulses. A good song — even a bad one heard at the right moment  — can cast a glow of enchantment over ordinary circumstances.  “Once” understands this everyday pop magic about as well as any movie I can think of, and communicates it so easily and honestly that you are likely to want to see it again.  “Once” is rated R. (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian.)  It has strong language.

Two actual Dublin singer-songwriters of as-yet minor renown play fictive ones in "Once," which took the World Cinema Audience Award at Sundance. Winningly unpretentious tale uses a wispy romantic narrative as a vehicle for attractive original tunes. Pic's charm seems so offhand one might not notice the skill with which helmer John Carney pulls it off, or how it plays like a full-blown musical without anyone bursting into song. Picked up for world rights minus Ireland by Summit Entertainment, "Once" will require outreach to folk/alt-rock fans to realize offshore sleeper potential.
A mid-30s man ID'd only as "Guy" (Glen Hansard) still works and lives above his father's vacuum repair shop, busking downtown in off-hours, hoping for a music-biz break. One day he's approached by a pretty Czech immigrant "Girl" (Marketa Irglova), who supports her mother and child -- the father remains back home -- selling roses to shoppers. She, too, is a musician-songwriter. When Guy gets past her initial pushiness, he finds both an artistic collaborator and a frustrating love object. Soon they're drafting other players for a marathon recording sesh. Natural thesping and appealing music make the whole enterprise a low-key charmer.

Once , written and directed by John Carney , is a deceptively simple moviea narrative strung together by pop songs, but without the sheen (or arrogance) of most cinematic musicals. By day, a Dublin  busker (Glen Hansard ) sings Van Morrison  on a street corner for spare change, which, on occasion, is swiped by old friends in far more desperate straits than he. At night, the singer switches to his own compositions, most written for the girlfriend who abandoned the guy (who has no name in the film or credits other than The Guy). A Czech girl (Markéta Irglová , billed only as The Girl) approaches The Guy and asks him about his songs. He brushes her off; she's pretty but too young (Irglová was 17 when the movie was shot two years ago). She's also persistent.
In time, it turns out this Girl selling flowers to strangers for loose coins is also a musiciana pianist and singer, every bit The Guy's equal. And so theirs becomes a friendship and partnershipthough not quite a relationship, because of The Guy's ex and The Girl's estranged husband. He teaches her his songs: He gives them heart, but she gives them soul. At last they marshal their forces and book time in a recording studio, where they cut a few tracks that will lead them . . . where? We have no idea at all by the end of 88 minutes that come and go far too fast. Ah, but that's the thing about Once : You'll probably want to see it twice.
Should you need to revisit the film right away, there is an album on which Hansard and Irglová have collaborated: The Swell Season  , released in August of last year. In glib shorthand, Once serves as an extended video for that record, on which Hansard sings like Cat Stevens  performing Damien Rice 's songs for a Coldplay  crowd as James Blunt  forlornly looks on wishing that were him at the mike. Hansard, best known for having played guitarist Outspan in Alan Parker 's The Commitments , writes perfectly heartbreaking pop songs that are lovely all on their own, chiefly the track "Falling Slowly" heard twice in Once . "I don't know you," Hansard sings, "but I want you."
Yet the magic of the movie is how utterly wrenching it renders these songs, which thrive alongside the film's simple, eloquent, dusky narrative. Hence, Once 's burgeoning legend among those who saw it at this year's Sundance Film Festival  as one of the greatest musicals of the modern agea movie in which people sing to each other, only without the genre's distancing artifice. After all, The Guy and The Girl are musicians; pop songs are their language, how they communicate in ways both grand and miniature. They don't break into song for no reason; they're people who can only express themselves through thinly veiled metaphors and perfectly constructed melodies. The Guy and The Girlnot to mention Hansard and Irglováhave spent their whole lives constructing this soundtrack to sing what they can't quite say.
When she asks him about his lifehe lives with his pa, above their vacuum repair shophe strums a few notes and sings a few words; they're on the back of a bus, he with his guitar and she with her questions, and it's the most absolutely normal thing in the world. But their first duet is something transcendent: a performance of that song, "Falling Slowly," so special that the album doesn't do it justice. They're in a music store, where The Girl goes during lunch hours to play the piano she cannot afford. She plays him a few notes of her own song, and she asks him to play something of his. He walks her through a few bars of a songhim strumming his strings, her stumbling along the keys. Then he begins to sing"I don't know you, but I want you"and the song written for a distant love becomes immediately about this Girl who's wandered into this Guy's life. And they know it. They're no longer strangers awkwardly getting to know each other, but they're not lovers eitherthey can't be, not just because of their distant significant others but because that's how most relationships are.
Credit to Carney, a former member of The Frames  more than 15 years ago, for making such a sincere film and having the sense not to bring in hired acting guns to lip-synch someone else's heartbreak. Cillian Murphy  was at one point going to play The Guy, and that would have ruined it. Only Hansard knows the secrets that lie between the chords.
