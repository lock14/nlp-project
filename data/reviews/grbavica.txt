 Life after wartime does not snap back to normal. In the opening scene of “Grbavica: The Land of My Dreams” the camera slowly pans across the stony, careworn faces of the women in a therapy group in the Sarajevo neighborhood that gives the movie its name. One of them can’t stop giggling uncontrollably but is ignored by the others, who remain sealed behind walls of private grief and resignation. Some, like Esma (Mirjana Karanovic), the movie’s central character, attend only on days when financial aid is distributed.  During the war in Bosnia, Grbavica was the site of a prison camp in which torture and rape were epidemic. A decade later mass graves are still being opened, and survivors flock to identify the bodies of husbands and lovers.  Jasmila Zbanic, who wrote and directed “Grbavica” (pronounced grr-BAH-vee-tsah), lived near the camp, and her film conveys the anguish of a community struggling to move on even though its wounds remain unhealed. A single mother who lives with her tomboyish 12-year-old daughter, Sara (Luna Mijovic), Esma barely makes ends meet from her job in a shoe factory. She takes a job as a cocktail waitress in a sleazy nightclub run by Caran (Bogdan Diklic), a thug with a shaved head, a hair-trigger temper and a gambling habit.  Violent and superstitious, Caran pressures her to use her intuition before he places his bets. When one of her guesses yields him a windfall, he adopts her as his good-luck charm. But the moment her intuition fails, he relapses into a brute.  Everywhere the anarchic forces unleashed by the war still run rampant. Caran casually deals in murder to settle scores. Prostitution flourishes at his club. Sara is a defiant, wild child, who alternately screams at her mother and clings to her. She is at exactly the age when boy-girl roughhousing begins to change from combative to erotic. Her first boyfriend, Samir (Kenan Catic), who also lost his father in the war, proudly shows off the gun he inherited. The weapon excites her.  The tension between the present and the recent past is embodied in the volatile relationship between mother and daughter, which comes to a boil over the issue of Sara’s paternity. She is desperate to know more about her father, whom Esma has assured her was a war hero, or shaheed. But Sara, unlike Samir, hasn’t been told the details of her father’s death, and she relentlessly badgers her mother for more information.  A school trip is approaching that the children of shaheeds can join for a discount if they have certification of their dead fathers’ heroic status. As Esma delays producing a certificate, Sara is taunted by her schoolmates because she is not on the list of martyrs’ children, and she grows increasingly suspicious of her mother’s evasive answers. Without a certificate, she can go on the trip only at full cost: 200 euros, which Esma doesn’t have. As the day of departure looms, Esma goes from friend to friend begging for a loan. Eventually the truth spills out in a melodramatic and too-abrupt but shattering scene.  Much of the emotional power of “Grbavica” comes from the exceptional performances of Ms. Karanovic and Ms. Mijovic, as they act out an age-old conflict exacerbated by the horrors of recent history. Esma deeply loves her daughter but doesn’t hesitate to slap her sharply across the face when she flies into an abusive tantrum.  And when Pelda (Leon Lucev), a bouncer in the club, begins pursuing Esma romantically, Sara is terrified of being abandoned. Esma responds tentatively to Pelda’s attentions, fending him off while keeping his interest. Her relationship with this tender, softhearted goon in Caran’s criminal enterprise isn’t entirely credible.  At once intrepid and beaten down, Ms. Karanovic’s Esma is a woman slowly breaking through the layers of anguish and defeat that the world has heaped upon her, and the actress (so memorable in the films of Emir Kusturica) invests her with an embattled nobility expressed without a trace of grandstanding. Ms. Mijovic is a live wire spitting sparks against Ms. Karanovic’s brick-wall defenses.  Throughout “Grbavica” the desire to forget and the need to remember are at loggerheads. At Sara’s school the psychological wounds of the war are being handed down to her generation through the separation of heroes and nonheroes. Fathers pass their weapons down to their sons. Even as you leave a war behind, you bring it with you.

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

Shameful secrets block mother-daughter relations in sluggish meller "Grbavica," a debut feature from shorts and docu-maker Jasmila Zbanic. Central perf by Mirjana Karanovic ("When Father Was Away on Business," "Underground") is instantly endearing. Unfortunately, film coasts on thesp's ability to evoke sympathy and leaves her stranded in this yarn that's all setup and little payoff. Fests will want to take a look, but commercial cinematic prospects seem iffy. Pic will find ample opportunities on Euro tube.
Single mother Esma (Karanovic) frequents a woman's support group in Sarajevo. While the women are told by the social worker to talk about their pain, Esma keeps her mouth zipped, turning up only on days when financial support is dished out. To make ends meet, Esma takes a waitress job at a nightclub run by gangster Saran (Bogdan Diklic).
No matter how innocuous the source, every potential sign of violence or sex shows Esma operating on an emotional hair trigger. Also in the business of pushing Esma's buttons is feisty teenage tomboy daughter Sara (an impressive Luna Mijovic).
Sara has been encouraged by her mother to believe her father was a Bosnian war hero. However, when Sara's school offers to take the offspring of war heroes on a field trip for free, the adolescent girl needs documentation.
As Sara's sexual awakening is aroused by gun-toting, fellow student Samir (Kenan Catic), Esma also catches the eye of rugged nightclub bouncer Pelda (Leon Lucev). While Pelda attempts to romance Esma, she continues to keep him at arm's length. However, when Sara sees Pelda drop her mother off after work, the young girl fears that her mother will leave her.
As a character study, pic initially intrigues but depends too heavily on thesps' abilities to carry the day. Dramatic tension is cranked up at the 11th hour and a pivotal plot point is clumsily rushed through. Suddenly, from little happening, everything occurs at once and the effect muffles overall dramatic impact. Esma's big secret, divulged in all press materials, barely has time to resonate.
All perfs are convincing and Zbanic's helming is clean, uncomplicated and pro. Script difficulties suggest pic may have benefited from being slightly longer, for clarity's sake. Lensing is easy on the eye and all other tech credits do the job. Title refers to the area of Sarajevo where Esma and Sara live.

A wash in daily news of mass savagery, collective memory grows short. We feel for the women of Afghanistan , but who these days remembers the war widows and rape victims of the 199295 civil war that sent Yugoslavia  to hell and brought it back a divided country? Now comes the young Bosnian writer-director Jasmila Zbanic  to remind us of one of the more devastating consequences of ethnic cleansing, a Serbo-Croat euphemism for genocide that has since morphed into a gruesomely useful term to describe mass killings from Rwanda  to Iraq . Titled with heavy irony, Grbavica: The Land of My Dreams,  which carried off a Golden Bear at last year's Berlin Film Festival  and is Bosnia-Herzegovina 's official 2006 entry for Best Foreign Language Film, is not the first movie to be made about the rape of more than 20,000 Bosnian women by Serbo-Montenegrin forces. But it is no less haunting for being the least graphic, in part because Zbanic's subject is not violence itself, but the way its cruel aftermath washes through the everyday lives of those who survived.
Grbavica  is set in the eponymous Sarajevo  neighborhood that was formerly a Serbian internment camp and now houses a large concentration of women who subsist on slim government handouts and bitter memories. The word grbavica  also means "woman with a hump," an evocative image that Zbanic harnesses to symbolize the burden carried by Esma, a careworn, middle-aged single mother played with matter-of-fact directness by Mirjana Karanovic , a veteran star of the films of Bosnian director Emir Kusturica . Notwithstanding her sad brown eyes, the tone is far from lugubrious. We see Esma giggling at a local women's center, then roughhousing happily on her living-room floor with her 12-year-old daughter Sara (played by the enchanting sprite Luna Mijovic ). At first the movie plays its cards close to its chest: When Sara playfully pins her mother's hands to the floor and she suddenly stiffens in pain and grows agitated, it seems as though we're in for a cancer weepy. In fact there's a long-held secret, masked by a tacitly agreed upon fiction about the identity of Sara's missing father, that gnaws away at this loving but scrappy mother-daughter intimacy, driving them both to the point of crisis.
While Sara ratchets up the risky behavior with a wild boy and a gun, Esma, in an effort to make extra money to finance her daughter's class trip, wears herself out in two jobs that hold up a mirror not just to her plight, but that of a society disfigured by its brutal wars. By days she works in a shoe factory, sustained by its all-female work force united in common suffering. By night she serves drinks in a bar whose masculine sexual vibe, hitched to openly condoned violence, reduces her to a tangle of pain and rage.
Grbavica  is neither formally nor intellectually a sophisticated work. Its politics come with a very small p , and Zbanic's youthful faith in the notion that the truth shall set you free verges on the reductive when applied to a country still reeling from the use of sex as a tool of political domination. At times her characters can barely breathe without giving voice to wider social conflicts. Straining plausibility, Esma strikes up a tentative romance with, of all things, a sensitive hit man. But Grbavica  is a womanly movie in the best sense: Zbanic has a deeply feminine sense of how crisis gets filtered through the domesticity of daily life. She is no wuss, though: Before we hear the two final songs, a keening voice of despair followed by the hopeful trill of a bus full of schoolchildren going on vacation, there comes a shattering confession of maternal love and hatred, the legacy of a generation of women who, day after day, must carry their humps on their backs, and shrug them off in the name of the future.
