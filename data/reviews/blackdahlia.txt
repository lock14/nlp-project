Since `` The Black Dahlia" more or less tells the story of an actress, a heinously murdered one at that, it makes sense that the first thing you notice about this so-so adaptation of James Ellroy's novel is the shoddy acting.
Fixating on the performances seems inevitable since it's a Brian De Palma picture. The director bears the unique distinction of being responsible for some of the most sublime performances in the movies (Sissy Spacek in ``Carrie," say, or John Travolta in ``Blow Out") and some of the worst (see ``Bonfire of the Vanities" -- or don't). But 
``The Black Dahlia" is woefully short on the sublime.
Ellroy's 1987 novel spun the notorious butchering of Elizabeth Short, a 22-year-old aspiring starlet from Medford, into a strange noir melodrama. Like the book, the film is set in post-World War II Los Angeles and tells the tale through the lazy eyes of Dwight ``Bucky" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett), a lanky cop and ex-GI, who is promoted from beat work to the sexier warrants division.
There, along with his psychologically volatile partner, Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart), Dwight descends, as too many real-life men have, into an obsession with the case of the dismembered young woman. Mia Kirshner plays Betty dolorously in flashbacks and screen tests that provide the film with its only true emotional substance. You can see why writers and detectives would have a hard time shaking those big sad eyes.
Hartnett seems ideal for this line of work. He has a slow-to-wake innocence that suits a character whose detective skills always appear to be two or three scenes behind ours. The character's smarts are slightly below average, and Hartnett doesn't have the gravity to raise him up. He's almost too innocent.
One of the film's many outré developments involves Dwight's relationship with Lee and his girlfriend, Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson). They welcome him into their lives, forming a sort of triangle that grows less equilateral every time Kay leans in to talk to Dwight during Lee's inexplicable absences.
The cop's search for Betty's murderer leads him to her uncomfortable stint in girl-on-girl porn and to a fabulously seedy lesbian bar, where k.d. lang is singing Cole Porter and Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), a kinky acquaintance of the deceased, 
has just made a furtive exit.
Madeleine is odd. Her wealthy family is nuts. Dwight comes to pick Madeleine up for a date, and winds up sitting down for a meal with her Scottish father (John Kavanagh), deranged mother (Fiona Shaw), and cute, crass little sister (Rachel Miner). It's dinner theater in every possible way. Yet the movie is never quite as good or weird as that sequence. In fact, what comes next is ultimately a drag.
De Palma does a passable job of restaging highlights from his earlier, better movies. One climactic murder sequence in ``Black Dahlia," set on an indoor balustrade, conjures the carriage-descending-a-staircase moment from ``The Untouchables" and crosses it with the slasher stuff from ``Raising Cain." There's also a lovely daylight sequence of cars and characters pulling shadily in and out of a wide frame, done mostly in a single take. And the editing, with its wipes and melting fades, is playful. But my, does ``The Black Dahlia" feel empty.
Ellroy's book was composed, rather creepily, in a fit of filial obsession. His mother was killed some years after Betty Short, and by the author's admission her murder fueled his writing about Short's. So in a sense, the novel was the product of personal compulsion and psychological purging. De Palma would seem ideal for material of such dark provenance. His best and most inspired work -- ``Sisters," ``Dressed to Kill," ``Blow Out," ``Body Double" -- is about the inexhaustible narrative possibilities of obsession. But ``Black Dahlia" is too structurally and thematically sloppy to either capture obsession or inspire it.
This adaptation, by Josh Friedman, doesn't try to make any sense of Los Angeles social history the way Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson did with their strategic paring down of Ellroy's ``L.A. Confidential." De Palma's movie is content being vague and trashy, which is fine. But not everybody in the cast seems prepared for such lurid business, and you pity De Palma. He seems unaware that he's not working with the dynamic stars of his prime. This movie has no Travolta or, for Pete's sake, Kevin Costner to bestow, respectively, a palpable sense of sex or strain of morality.
MORE HOLLYWOOD CRIME 
For instance, he doesn't seem to know how to use Johansson. (Few male directors do.) She's playing a homemaker with a sad past and barely seems to be registering the present. She, Hartnett, and Eckhart, who barrels through the part with his chin, make merry in one early dinner sequence that's embarrassingly corny. Swank, though, gives off a slummy classical-Hollywood hauteur that's fun insofar as it feels like she's playing dress-up.
``The Black Dahlia" calls to mind 1976's all-teen gangster spoof, ``Bugsy Malone," minus the vitality and sporty musical airs. The sight, in De Palma's movie, of these kids -- there's no other word -- pretending to be grown-ups suggests a crisis in Tinsel Town: ``The Black Dahlia" feels too much like a put-on to be completely seductive. It's less a smutty murder mystery than a film-noir costume party.

I'm always happy, at least in theory, when Brian De Palma, that outrageously gifted flake, leaves aside his slow-motion set pieces and sub-Vertigo  mystery blondes, his look-ma-no-hands traveling shots, his whole showy candied-camera ''virtuosity'' and goes back to making an honest-to-God movie. So I should be glad, at least in theory, that he has now made The Black Dahlia . Adapted from a James Ellroy novel, which was itself a fictional reworking of the legendary unsolved Hollywood slasher case of 1947, it's an old-fashioned noir made in the gallows-smirk spirit of L.A. Confidential . Dominated by one of those jazzy trumpet-blues scores that's the aural equivalent of sun streaming through venetian blinds, the film is more than a little in love with the corruption it finds under the floorboards  and that, of course, is perfectly dandy. I wouldn't trust a film noir that wasn't enthralled by decadence.
Like Ellroy's L.A. Confidential , The Black Dahlia  offers an uneasy pair of detectives, Dwight ''Bucky'' Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Leland ''Lee'' Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart), whose lives get twisted together like grapevines. At the beginning, they face off in an amateur boxing contest, which climaxes when Lee, in a raging punch, knocks out Bucky's front teeth  a rather curious way to establish that these two men are about to become the most trusting of comrades, but then, we all bond in different ways. Besides, there's a sadomasochistic pull to the entire relationship, as Lee's girlfriend, who has the How fatale  am I? name of Kay Lake, insists on treating Lee as a piece of the furniture and Bucky, the wholesome odd guy out, like an animal she'd like to maul, but gently. As Kay, Scarlett Johansson, so lost as the robo-girl reporter of Woody Allen's Scoop , takes to the pulpy period atmosphere as if it were oxygen. In a Lana Turner coif, she shows a flair for double-talk  for come-ons that are blatant in their sensuality yet hide the mystery of how serious they are. Bucky and Lee make a crack cop team until a horror is found in a weedy field: a young woman's corpse, the body sawed in half like a magician's trick gone wrong, her mouth sliced upward at the corners to form a hideous clown rictus. The woman, Elizabeth Short (Mia Kirshner), was a starlet and sultry ''innocent,'' the kind of good-time girl who landed auditions but not roles, and the investigation into her killing leads to what are supposed to be the shadiest corners of Hollywood.
There are lesbian bars  more than one! There's an eccentric friend of Elizabeth's all done up in Cleopatra tinsel. There's a wealthy demented family whose members, for one scene, lend the movie an off-key ghoulish verve. Bucky is introduced to them after he starts seeing their daughter, Madeleine, played by Hilary Swank in a breathy Diana Vreeland accent as an enticing aristocratic harlot. Swank and Hartnett lend the picture a bit of steam. Yet while it's fine for Bucky, whom Hartnett embodies with a bit too much of his perpetual squinty boyishness, to be pulled toward sin, the audience needs to have a clear idea of what he wants and who he wants it with. Is it the decadent Madeleine? The voluptuous Kay? Or coltish Elizabeth, whom he watches, like a voyeur, in amateur black-and-white audition films that threaten to turn into porno until they finally do?
Somehow, it's all dreadfully old hat. The hideous fascination of the Black Dahlia case, and all the cases like it, is that it's driven by a shuddery link between sexual obsession (easy to relate to) and homicide (not). A movie like this one asks: Where do the two meet? It's the same question taken up by the rapt, absorbing, criminally underattended Hollywoodland , which digs into why a town as image-driven as Hollywood has so often found blood on the other side of a moving picture. The Black Dahlia  starts well, but it has too many femmes fatales , too many blind alleys that lead nowhere, too much sinister convoluted nonsense. The screenplay, by Josh Friedman, doesn't streamline Ellroy's density (as L.A. Confidential  did); it diagrams it. I was never clear, for instance, just what Aaron Eckhart is doing in this movie. His Lee is supposed to be driven nuts by his fixation on the Dahlia case, but instead he seems to enter a different film entirely, maybe a more dark and interesting one. The murder itself gets solved in a fireworks display of gothic high jinks that is neither unsettling nor particularly convincing. The Black Dahlia  isn't a cheat, it's just a misfire, but the most surprising feeling it stirred in me was nostalgia for Brian De Palma's old flamboyance. Come back, candied-camera junkie!

 THE union of Brian De Palma and the murdered woman known as the Black Dahlia should have been a marriage made in movie heaven or, preferably, hell. A master of modern horror, Mr. De Palma has a flair for the frenzy of violence, specifically when visited on the female body, which  makes him seem an ideal fit for this spectacularly cruel crime. At their finest, his films are marvels of virtuosity, alive to the  contradictory, at times disreputable pleasures of the movies. Blood runs through his work, but so does juicy life. In “The Black Dahlia,” though, that life has been drained from the filmmaking, much as the blood was drained from the victim’s body.  On Jan. 15, 1947, a housewife pushing a baby carriage saw what she thought was a store mannequin lying in a weedy lot in South Los Angeles. This waxy white shape was the neatly severed body of a 22-year-old woman named Elizabeth Short. Betty, as she was often called, had moved from Massachusetts to Southern California to look for work and to meet her absent father. What she found was nice weather and lots of men who were probably hoping for more than a smile in exchange for a hot meal. She was restless and broke, and wore her hair and clothes black, which is how she earned her nickname. It was the kind of moniker that later looked particularly striking emblazoned in newspaper headlines.  You meet Betty Short (Mia Kirshner), or at least an idea of her, only briefly in “The Black Dahlia.” Like the James Ellroy novel on which the film is based, the story mostly turns on the violent ups and downs of two detectives hot on the case, Bucky Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) and Lee Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart). In the boxing ring where they mix it up on behalf of their superiors, the men are called Mr. Ice and Mr. Fire, respectively, for their wildly different temperaments. (Given the performances, Mr. Droopy and Mr. Hammy would be more fitting.) When not chasing leads, Bucky and Lee like to play house with Lee’s girlfriend, Kay (Scarlett Johansson), a plush blonde with a throaty laugh and battle scars.  The first novel in Mr. Ellroy’s “L. A. Quartet,” a series of pulpy page-turners that begin in the early 1940’s and end more than a decade later, his “Black Dahlia” is dedicated to his mother, Geneva. He was just 10 in 1958 when she was murdered, and her body dumped, like that of Betty Short, by the side of the road as if it were garbage. His mother’s unsolved murder haunted him, and it led to an early, obsessive interest in Betty Short. Like the other books in the quartet, including “L. A. Confidential,”  made into a 1997 film by Curtis Hanson, “The Black Dahlia” hurtles along, propelled by that obsession and by rage. There’s craziness in this book: it feels as if it were  written by a man possessed.  Mr. De Palma can be a director of dazzling creative lunacy, but there’s little craziness in this restrained, awkward film. With the diverting exception of Hilary Swank, who plays a slinky degenerate named Madeleine Linscott, the leads are disastrous. Ms. Johansson and Mr. Eckhart are actors who need as much help from their directors as they can get, the kind of help  that Mr. De Palma, as the uneven performances in his films indicate, cannot always provide. Mr. Eckhart flails about, mistaking volume for passion and inviting regrettable comparison to Russell Crowe running amok in “L. A. Confidential.” Ms. Johansson tries to fashion her character by flourishing a cigarette holder; Mr. Hartnett, who provides the narration, flounders on the shallows of his interpretation.  Only Ms. Swank, who puts some Katharine Hepburn into her voice and just as much conviction into the rest of her performance, delivers the goods. Her character, a rich brat out of Raymond Chandler by way of Mr. Ellroy (think “The Big Sleep,” but creepier) lives with her whack-job family in one of those mansions that serves as a tomb for its inhabitants and a monument to their ambitions. There’s a stuffed doggie in the foyer (a casualty of Daddy’s unfortunate enthusiasms), fleets of silent servants in the dining room and the pervasive stench of rot. Mr. De Palma obviously enjoys hanging out with this decadent brood, whose demons read as symptomatic of the city it calls home and whose pathologies prove nuttily entertaining.  But if he seems right at home among the Linscotts, Mr. De Palma is ill at ease when he spends time with most anyone else. His best work here, which notably involves none of the principals, is a fantastic shot that moves up from street level to peer over the roof of a building where some crows are ominously cawing. Behind the building on the next block, a woman with a carriage pauses to look at something in a lot, before breaking into a shrieking run. This is bravura filmmaking, reminiscent of some of Mr. De Palma’s other grand flourishes, in that you are both aware of the image’s self-conscious artificiality (you can almost feel the director hovering nearby) and captive to its emotional impact.  The ability to draw you into a film while simultaneously making you aware that you are watching a movie is an important element in some of his most successful work. This helps explain why he’s better when playing within the strict confines of genre, and in the key of pop, than when trying his hand at heavy reality, as he did in the lugubrious Vietnam drama “Casualties of War.” Reality weighs similarly heavy on “The Black Dahlia.” Betty Short was a real woman who was slowly and brutally tortured to death, and whose killer tried to dehumanize her by turning her into an object.  Her story may have the makings of great pulp fiction, but there is nothing playfully cinematic or campy about it.  The murdered woman simply doesn’t inspire Mr. De Palma to unhinged creativity the way she did Mr. Ellroy. That said, there are tantalizing glimpses of another film interpretation in the short scenes featuring Betty Short. During the investigation, some audition reels turn up,  with her trying out for a role. As Ms. Kirshner, wearing torn stockings and streaked mascara, reads for the part, looking into the camera with her spooky, clear eyes, you see need and desperation and why a frightened young woman with no resources beyond her looks might have relied on a body whose very vulnerability would finally betray her. Every so often, an off-screen male voice asks Betty a question, needling and provoking her until she crawls toward the camera like a sacrifice.  And the man behind the voice? Why, Mr. De Palma, of course.  “The Black Dahlia” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The whole kinky nine yards.

A literally ripping good yarn is undercut by some lackluster performances and late-inning overripe melodrama in "The Black Dahlia." Based on James Ellroy's estimable fictional account of what was, for 47 years, Los Angeles' most notorious unsolved murder, this lushly rendered noir
 finds director Brian De Palma in fine visual fettle as he pulls off at least three characteristically eye-popping set pieces while trying, with mixed success, to keep some pretty cockeyed plotlines under control. Given the difficulty even the significantly superior Ellroy adaptation "L.A. Confidential" had in attracting a sizable audience, anything more than a moderate B.O. turnout looks doubtful.
Like the novel, script by Josh Friedman ("War of the Worlds") uses the horrific 1947 killing of 22-year-old would-be actress Elizabeth "Betty" Short as a way to delve into the specifically Southern California brand of crime, sleaze, corruption, hypocrisy, cover-up, disillusionment and dream-crushing that has been a staple of resonant pulp fiction for decades.
In this respect, "The Black Dahlia" covers familiar ground, both thematically and in its seductively tawdry atmosphere highlighted by the usual downtown-area locations, deco apartments, constant cigarette smoke, beautiful cars, men in natty suits and hats and women in gorgeous glamour gowns, with the gap between the rich and powerful and those they would keep down never far from the center of things. Add the evocatively bluesy-jazz score and you might almost hear yourself muttering, "Chinatown."
But "Chinatown" it ain't, not in any department. On its own level, however, new pic generates a reasonable degree of intrigue, initially in the ambiguous relationship among tough L.A. homicide detectives Leland "Lee" Blanchard (Aaron Eckhart), younger partner Dwight "Bucky" Bleichert (Josh Hartnett) -- former boxers nicknamed "Fire" and "Ice"-- and their voluptuous blond platonic ladyfriend Kay Lake (Scarlett Johansson). What gives with this threesome isn't revealed until later, but Eckhart in particular takes the opportunity of the opening half-hour set-up to carve a strong impression as a volatile, aggressive cop ready for just about anything on a police force that craves his kind of guy.
In the first big set piece, the camera arches high and low and around and about in covering Lee and Bucky's stakeout of and shootout with some lowlifes in a lousy neighborhood. As their real target slips away, the mutilated body of a young woman is discovered in a field across the street; she's been cut in half, disemboweled and drained of blood, her head bludgeoned and her mouth extended by three-inch cuts on each side into a sick grin, details the police are intent on withholding from the public.
Hotshots Fire and Ice take on the case, but their few interviews with those who knew Betty Short yield little other than her grandiose dreams of movie stardom and her good-times attitude toward men, especially those in uniform.
Bucky becomes fixated on a long screen test he discovers in which Betty (Mia Kirshner) was prodded and interrogated by a director (voiced by De Palma himself).
Strangely, the combination of Betty's killing and the imminent release of a criminal he long ago put away makes the more experienced Lee flip out; with this, the most watchable and compelling character in the picture thus far frequently disappears from view for murky reasons, forcing the lower-voltage Bucky and Kay to the fore.
This changes for the better when Bucky's investigation into a lesbian angle in Betty's life leads him to high-society dark lady Madeleine Linscott (Hilary Swank), who turns up during a wonderful for-gals-only supper club production number of "Love for Sale" crooned by none other than k.d. lang. The suggestive sparring between the working-class cop and the classy woman with a pronounced physical resemblance to the murder victim may not be of the highest order, but it's enough to get them where they need to go, between the sheets and into a hot romance involving untold layers of deception.
Madeleine proves the lowly Bucky's passport to the rarefied realm of the city's drippingly wealthy, starting with her family: There's naughty younger sister Martha (Rachel Miner), batty mother (Fiona Shaw) and strange Scottish father (John Kavanagh). A dinner scene with this quintet is so bizarre you can only laugh, with Shaw's perf so over the top, albeit intentionally, that it amounts to a curious spectacle unto itself.
The convergence in a marbled lobby with massive surrounding stairs of Bucky, the unhinged Lee and his now ex-con adversary provides the elements for De Palma's most virtuoso scene, one in which shocking and upsetting violence forever alters the trajectories of several lives and the picture.
Hereafter, revelations about who was up to what become essential, leading to a big and near-ludicrous explanatory scene in which far too much information needs to be swallowed in one gulp to be remotely digestible. Once the table has been cleared, it's hard to buy what's proposed here as a satisfactory resolution to an persistently baffling case.
Eckhart's very good and so is Swank as a temptress with many games to play. But Hartnett is too blank and expressionless to carry the picture; he narrates and is almost constantly on view, but offers little nuance or depth. His Bucky is the eternal hard-bitten cop who learns life's bitter lessons on the job. It's not the actor's fault that so many great macho stars have made their names playing such parts, but it's impossible to watch "The Black Dahlia" and not idly think of how indelibly Bogart, Mitchum, Sterling Hayden, Jack Nicholson, Russell Crowe and numerous others have handled such roles.
Although she looks properly in period, Johansson also is weak, evoking little of the requisite vulnerability in a damaged woman who keeps the reasons for her hurt, and her real emotional impulses, deeply submerged.
Seen mostly in the vintage black-and-white screen test and brief flashbacks, Kirshner nicely catches the unformed dreaminess of a young fabulist who became famous only in death, while supporting cast of lesser-known thesps playing cops and baddies registers well.
It's great to see cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond working at full command on a big picture again after several years on more marginal projects. His scope framing and constant camera moves possess a bracing confidence.
Much of the film was shot in Bulgaria, but you'd never know it, as Dante Ferretti's unerring production design and Jenny Beavan's costumes combine with sufficient Los Angeles exterior work to provide authentic atmosphere.
Mark Isham's moody, old-fashioned score is one of his best, pumping up the dread and suspense and often providing emotional substance where the actors can't manage it.

Directed by Brian De Palma  from the novel by neo-noirist James Ellroy , The Black Dahlia  is a true-crime policier unfolding in late-'40s Los Angeles somewhere between the neighborhoods of Chinatown and Mulholland Drive.
The premise involves one of L.A.'s most notorious unsolved homicides. In early 1947, the naked corpse of a 22-year-old aspiring actress was found dumped in a South Central lot. She had been cut in half at the waist and surgically disemboweled; her blood was drained, her legs were splayed, and her face was carved into a jack-o'-lantern grin. The gruesome details were suppressed, but the mysterious victim (nicknamed in the press for her dark hair and matching wardrobe) entered local mythology as Hollywood 's ultimate lost soul. Many confessed to the crime. The cops, the tabs, and assorted cultists cast a wide net: Celebrity suspects included Woody Guthrie  and Orson Welles .
In City of Quartz , historian Mike Davis  calls the Black Dahlia murder "the crucial symbolic commencement of the postwar eraa local 'name of the rose' concealing a larger metaphysical mystery." (Like a blood sacrifice on the altar of Hollywood.) Subject of a mid-'70s made-for-TV movie starring Lucie Arnaz , the Dahlia figured in John Gregory Dunne 's True Confessions  and the movie adapted from it, before "demon dog" Ellroy packed the case with his own not inconsiderable obsessions. Hewing closely to the first half of Ellroy's novel, the movie Black Dahlia  is less the tale of the eponymous victim or even the investigation into her death than that of the posthumous spell the dead woman cast on two cops, Bucky Bleichert  (Josh Hartnett ) and Lee Blanchard  (Aaron Eckhart ).
Pugilists both, sweet-tempered Bucky and brash Lee meet in the midst of a wartime zoot suit riot and again, for a bit of election-year LAPD promotion, in the boxing ring. They become partners and then an uneasy threesome once Lee introduces Bucky to his girlfriend, Kay (dame du jour Scarlett Johansson ), a lush-lipped dish who waves her cigarette holder as though flagging down a ride. Lee and Kay share many secrets. When, in an unlikely date, the trio goes to see the 1928 silent horror flick The Man Who Laughs , De Palma lets his camera linger on Kay's agonized response to the protagonist's scarred face. She, we soon discover, has herself been branded.
Steeped in sexual pathology, replete with mutilation, doubling, fetishes, and porn, Ellroy's Dahlia scenario would seem to be De Palma's meat. The movie, however, is anything but overheated and largely impersonal. De Palma's interest is strictly pyrotechnical. He choreographs his cops through a convoluted shoot-out on the streets of South Central, enabling the cosmic coincidence where they stumble upon the just-discovered Dahlia crime scene. (The subsequent overhead view of the Dahlia autopsy is a rote De Palma touch.)
Competence trumps crazinessif not the limits of the screenplay, written by War of the World  co-scripter Josh Friedman . Although the action set pieces are impressive, the exposition is sluggish. For all the posh dollies, high angles, and Venetian-blind crisscross patterns, The Black Dahlia  rarely achieves the rhapsodic (let alone the delirious). In the designated music video, Bucky finds himself investigating the Dahlia's connections in some La-La Lesbian Land. He's the only male, save for the band, in a deluxe supper club where K.D. Lang  sings "Love for Sale" as several dozen chorines gather in mock orgy formation on a grand staircase to nowhere.
A strangely Dahlia-esque brunette is haunting the joint. Bucky pursues her, discovering that Madeleine (a glamorously unrecognizable Hilary Swank , giving the movie's sparkiest performance) is a swinger from a very rich, powerful, and freaky Los Angeles family. Dinner with the folks is nearly as grotesque as the family gathering in Eraserhead . Madeleine's father, she tells Bucky once they've bedded down in an appropriately tawdry motor court, built a firetrap housing development out of movie sets discarded by Mack Sennett . Thus do celluloid fantasies insinuate themselves into life.
More obviously, the action is punctuated by suggestive screen tests featuring Mia Kirshner 's bland Dahlia, as well as flashbacks to The Man Who Laughs . Although, from a narrative point of view, these interludes are as inexplicable as Bucky's failure to be bounced from the force for rampant indiscretions, they are necessary to establish the Dahlia as the unquiet corpse of every would-be starlet whose heart was ground for dog food. The movie's own heart of darkness is a deserted movie set, complete with torture death chamber, beneath the Hollywood sign. Its piéce de résistance is a stag film featuring the Dahlia and a jailbait buddy. The cops watch this one at headquarters. Lee goes hysterical and splits; his Dahlia obsession leads, in another De Palma set piece, to his downfall. Bucky's fate is more ambiguous. Caught between branded blonde and moneyed brunette, sharing criminal secrets with both, he needs to figure out which is the witch.
Describing the Dahlia's tawdry vehicle, Bucky allows that it's "pretty spooky stuff." Would that were true for the entire picture. The movies have everything to do with the Dahlia's desire and the mania this imaginary creature inspires. De Palma is not, however, remaking Vertigo ; although he casts himself as the Dahlia's unseen director, that obsession seems no longer his. There are moments when The Black Dahlia  projects a spectral world, but its ghosts in broad daylight are elusive at best.
