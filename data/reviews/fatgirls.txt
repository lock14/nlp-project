 A plaintive portrait of a gay high school student looking for love in a small Texas town? Or a warmed-over John Waters-style farce that ridicules easy targets like evangelical Christians and petty high school bureaucrats? “Fat Girls” doesn’t know which it wants to be and ends up stranded between two concepts, either of which might have yielded a more satisfying film.  “Fat Girls” was written, directed and co-produced by Ash Christian, a 22-year-old Texan filmmaker of some promise. Mr. Christian also plays Rodney Miller, the self-aware, virginal sad sack who narrates the story and who by the end of the film has developed some badly needed self-esteem. To Rodney “fat girl” is a catchall term for a teenage pariah; it is, he says, “a state of mind.”  At lunchtime Rodney’s companions are two fellow outcasts: 300-pound Sabrina (Ashley Fink), who is being brought up in a trailer by lesbian parents, and her boyfriend, Rudy (Robin De Jesus), a Cuban refugee adopted by an African-American family. When a guidance counselor summons Rodney to her office, she reacts with undisguised contempt to his stated career goal of being a Broadway star.  To his shock Rodney is befriended by Joey (Joe Flaten), a handsome, insolent new kid in town from England who gives him his first real kiss and takes him to a gay bar, where he discovers one of his teachers (Jonathan Caouette, the director of “Tarnation”) performing in drag. As a lark Joey agrees to be Rodney’s date to the high school graduation dance (which for some reason is never referred to as a prom). In the anticlimactic dance scene, which cries out to be a confrontational set piece, nothing much happens.  For all its veneer of sensitivity, “Fat Girls” turns ugly in a farcical sequence in which Sabrina gets stuck inside a Volkswagen Beetle while making out with Rudy. Even on the crudest finger-pointing level, it isn’t funny.  “Fat Girls” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong sexual content including graphic dialogue, language and some drug and alcohol use, all involving teenagers.

Placing the crass high school surrealist humor of "Strangers With Candy" in the familiar frame of a gay-teenage-misfit's coming-out saga, producer-writer-director-star Ash Christian's "Fat Girls" wins no points for delicacy. Still, it does score some laughs. Low budget presentation will play best on the small screen, which makes the most commercial sense for pic after touring gay fests. 
Broadway-ambitious high school senior Rodney Miller (Christian) considers himself a "fat girl" not because he's chubby and flamey but because it's a "state of mind" -- a low-self-esteem that by pic's end turns into a gotta-be-me affirmation. His best friend is genuinely female and extra-large Sabrina (Ashley Fink). She finds romance in Cuban-refugee sophomore Rudy (Robin De Jesus), while Rodney is shocked when hot new British classmate Joey (Joe Flaten) accepts his invitation to the Graduation Dance. (Why not just call it a prom?) With one character (played by "Tarnation" auteur Jonathan Caouette) called Seymour Cox, "Fat Girls" ain't aiming for nuance. Jokes are hit-and-miss, but they splat target often enough to make this a guilty pleasure that homophile fans of both "Napoleon Dynamite" and "American Pie" might enjoy.

Not many fat girls appear in Fat Girls , but that's not a problem: In this movie, nearly anyone can be a fat girlit's a mental state, one that Rodney (writer/director/star Ash Christian) tends to assign to the stranger members of his entourage, and that we may recognize in the entire oddball cast. Rodney is a gay high-school senior and a spiritual fat girl; his best friend, Sabrina (Ashley Fink ), is a literal one. They mope in and out of classrooms wearing expressions of gaping, undisguised horror that alone justify the existence of this film. Rodney's characteristic awkwardness is so severe as to inhibit most normal conversation, and it sometimes escalates from amusing to tragic, as when he rejects comfort after his father's death. He engages more successfully with the imaginary worlds of porn and plays, and dreams of starring on Broadway. Don't worry: He isn't talented. This film goes to some lengths not to be another high-school movie, which means prom stinks and no one can sing. Given Fat Girls ' honesty, and its delicately drawn examples of social hopelessness, the sudden, sugary, puzzling finale feels out of character. It's as though the film forgot how to talk to us.
