Snow Angels , David Gordon Green's captivating winter-chill tragedy, is a tale that encompasses murder, divorce, adultery, alcohol abuse, mental breakdown, and the disappearance of a small child. In other words, it's downbeat enough to make the recent Oscar-nominated films look like party games. Yet as adapted from a novel by Stewart O'Nan, Snow Angels  is such a fascinating smorgasbord of flawed behavior that it exerts the voyeuristic pull of a first-rate small-town soap opera. The one thing you can count on is that each new scene will reveal something  about the people on screen that you weren't expecting to see.
This is Green's fourth film, after George Washington , All the Real Girls , and Undertow , and it's by far his best. In the opening  scene, a high school marching band is rehearsing its slightly discombobulated  version of Peter Gabriel's ''Sledgehammer,'' the missed notes and slapdash choreography unfolding with pitch-perfect banality  until two gunshots ring out from the woods nearby. The film then leaps back several weeks to lay out the events that led up to those shots being fired. Arthur (Michael Angarano), a trombonist in the band, is our entry point into the story. He's a gawky, sweet kid whose folks are splitting up, and though we can see the pain it's caused him, the real problem is that Don (Griffin Dunne), his professor father, can't make up his mind about whether he wants to leave or not.
The fate that binds splintered couples is the driving theme of Snow Angels . At the heart of the movie is the far more volatile relationship of  Annie (Kate Beckinsale), a desperate beauty who works in a Chinese restaurant where  (amusingly) there isn't a Chinese employee in sight, and Glenn (Sam Rockwell), her estranged husband and the father of their 4-year-old daughter. An eager, shambling narcissist, Glenn is a recovering drunk and born-again Christian who keeps trying to do the right thing  like hold a job  but he's one of those karmic losers who drags more trouble around with him the more he tries to swat it away. Rockwell cooks up a complex, deceptively lighthearted portrait of a flake who caves in to something tormented.
Snow Angels  has an open-eyed curiosity and dread, with each scene punctuated by fresh psychological undercurrents. Beckinsale, at first, seems miscast (you have to get past her cosmopolitan aura), but she gives a searing and wide-awake performance as a woman trying to rise above the mess she's made of her life. Green maps out the intricate layered links among small-town characters (Annie used to be Arthur's babysitter), making this community a vibrant, troubled place, driven by hope as well as despair. The bond between Arthur and the cute geek of a newcomer he meets at school (the terrific Olivia Thirlby) is one of the most unaffected teen romances I've ever seen in a film. Ultimately, though, the frayed connections give way to guilt, loss, anger, and violence. You may be devastated, but you won't look away.

 The first half of David Gordon Green’s “Snow Angels” unfolds in the looming shadow of an awful tragedy. The audience knows something bad is coming because of the gunshots at the end of the opening scene, after which we are pulled back to a series of events beginning “weeks earlier.” But even without this framing device, it would be hard to mistake the mood of dread, defeat and lurking violence.  “Snow Angels” takes place in one of those American towns where the sky is gray, the air is cold, and the people are miserable. (While the film was shot mainly in Nova Scotia, the Stewart O’Nan novel on which it is based specifies southwestern Pennsylvania.)  Arthur (Michael Angarano) is a high school student — seen practicing with the school marching band when those shots ring out — whose parents are separating. Annie (Kate Beckinsale), his former baby sitter and now a co-worker at the local Chinese restaurant, has split with her husband, Glenn (Sam Rockwell), whose erratic embrace of religion seems more like a symptom of his instability than a balm for his tormented soul.  Annie is sleeping with Nate (Nicky Katt), who is married to her friend Barb (Amy Sedaris). Glenn and Annie have a young daughter, Tara (Grace Hudson), who seems to be in mortal danger every time she’s on camera, and even — or perhaps especially — when she isn’t.  The wintry pall of fatalism that hangs over all of them deadens the possibility of melodrama, which might have given “Snow Angels” a touch of lurid life. This is not an updated “Peyton Place,” but rather the kind of self-enclosed, hard-bitten American place fashionable in American fiction of the 1970s and ’80s and in American independent cinema ever since.  To his credit Mr. Green tries to break with the dour conventions of this glum, unadorned style of realism. For one thing, somewhat remarkably, “Snow Angels” is frequently quite funny — not in a glib or mocking way, but in the way that life, even at its worst, can be. Even in despair and under duress, people make jokes, say silly things and even laugh.  Mr. Katt and Ms. Sedaris are especially helpful in this regard, since they are able to suggest ridiculousness without making fun of the characters they are playing. And Mr. Rockwell has a similar gift, though Glenn’s self-undermining jokiness — an aspect of the earnest optimism that seems to guarantee eventual failure and disappointment — is more pathetic than amusing.  As for Ms. Beckinsale, her skill and discipline cannot overcome the sense that she is an exotic species transplanted into this grim ecosystem. Hard as she works to convince us otherwise, it’s a stretch to believe that a woman with the kind of poised confidence in her own beauty she manifests would wind up with an underachieving mouth breather like Glenn.  Somewhat more credible is the sweet, tentative romance that springs up between Arthur and a nerdy girl named Lila (Olivia Thirlby, who played Juno’s best pal). Mr. Angarano suggests a less frantic Shia LaBeouf, and his scenes with Ms. Thirlby (and also with Griffin Dunne, who plays his wayward father) are at once believably inarticulate and shyly eloquent. Arthur and Lila seem to dwell in a different movie from their sorry neighbors, an adolescent dream that Mr. Green appears to have been more comfortable directing than the sad tale of marital recrimination he must negotiate.  He is, after all, a collector of delicate, awkward moments, a writer and filmmaker whose affection for eccentricity has always been much more than the usual taste for quirkiness. His first feature, “George Washington,” remains a minor miracle: a lyrical evocation of the spirit of childhood with an eye for the accidental beauties and deep peculiarities of place.  With both his subsequent films, “All the Real Girls” and “Undertow,” Mr. Green has retained just enough of that idiosyncrasy to keep the promise of “George Washington” alive in the minds of his critical admirers. But these movies have also felt uneasily caught between his poetic, nonconforming impulses and the requirements of sustaining a career as a midlevel, specialty-division auteur. Each one is less special than the one before.  Mr. O’Nan’s book, humorless though it may be, nonetheless derives some power and authenticity from a precise sense of geography, class and time. (It is set in 1974.) Mr. Green’s film, in contrast, unfolds in no recognizable period, place or social milieu. Its characters seem unconnected to one another, so that their supposedly entwined fates add up to little more than a welter of bad news and a scattering of small comforts.  For a film full of murder, jealousy and fatalism, “Snow Angels” feels curiously small and anecdotal, and its impact diminishes as it nears its terrible conclusion. Those gunshots at the start portend at least one violent and gruesome death. By the time that happens, though, the movie has already expired — slowly, quietly and, given the talents behind it, painfully.  “Snow Angels” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, drunkenness, swearing and murder.

Mysteriously structured around two broken families and two fateful gunshots, "Snow Angels" reps a chilly departure for David Gordon Green. Tackling his first literary adaptation, the acclaimed writer-director has assembled a rich but uneven panorama of human suffering in a small town, awkwardly filtered through a young man's coming-of-age story. Emotionally harrowing and gentle by turns, this well-acted winter's tale is a more narrative-driven experience than Green's more lyrical Sundance entries, "George Washington" and "All the Real Girls," which may help it generate marginally stronger returns in specialized release despite mixed critical response.
The very title of Green's new project suggests an icy remove from the grime and sweat of his 2004 Southern-gothic thriller "Undertow," as well as "George Washington" and "All the Real Girls," which were both set in North Carolina. "Snow Angels" was shot in the much cooler climes of Nova Scotia, though unlike Stewart O'Nan's original novel -- set in western Pennsylvania in 1974 -- the film unspools in an unspecified location in the present day.
The opening shot of a high school marching band practicing on a football field, the camera weaving lazily in and out of their formations, at first seems entirely consistent with Green's poetic sensibility. But the narrative engine soon kicks in when the band members, including trombone player Arthur Parkinson (Michael Angarano), are caught off-guard by the distant but unmistakable sound of gunfire.
The film flashes back to weeks earlier, laying out two parallel threads that we now know are destined to converge. Arthur, 16, works part-time at a Chinese restaurant alongside Annie Marchand (Kate Beckinsale), a beautiful thirtysomething on whom he's always held an innocent crush.
Annie is having an affair with Nate Petite (Nicky Katt), who's married to her tough-talking friend and co-worker, Barb (Amy Sedaris, in a small triumph of offbeat casting). Meanwhile, Annie's ex-husband Glenn (Sam Rockwell), a recovering alcoholic and born-again Christian, persistently tries to get back into the good graces of her and their four-year-old daughter, Tara (Grace Hudson). Annie and Glenn rightfully assume center stage as the most tortured and conflicted figures in the drama, as Annie's perfidy is revealed and Glenn subsequently falls off the wagon -- allowing his violent, controlling nature to re-emerge, often in the name of religion.
Next to all this emotional turmoil, Arthur's story exists at a curious remove from the action, and is muted and low-key by comparison. Coping with his own parents' recent separation, the shy teen begins hanging out with Lila (Olivia Thirlby), a girl with a winningly offbeat personality and a talent for photography. As he demonstrated in "All the Real Girls," Green has a gift for capturing the tenderness and spontaneity of young love, and Angarano and Thirlby's moments together have a sweet, unabashedly sincere ring to them.
For audiences, pinpointing the elusive connection between the two threads will prove the heart of the matter. Aside from the fact that in each instance, a rejected father attempts to reconcile with wife and child, the film's most understated and resonant suggestion is that Annie and Glenn were once as passionately in love as Arthur and Lila are.
An unforeseeable accident at the midpoint confirms the film's superficial resemblance to other wintry examinations of family tragedy like "The Sweet Hereafter" and "The Ice Storm." For the most part, Green maintains an impressive control over the script's shifts in tone, even adding some wry humor to what could have been an oppressively bleak picture. It's the director's way of saying that domestic life (and drama, for that matter) is more than just the sum of its miseries.
Yet that sensibility ends up costing the film some credibility in its final, violent moments, and its explanation of those mysterious gunshots feels both agonizing and curiously rote. Green may be following O'Nan's text, but this wouldn't be the first such film to use a climactic tragedy to resolve what should, in theory, be unresolvable.
In the end, "Snow Angels" is perhaps best understood as a study in community isolation, in which personal connections are inevitably fleeting and the private pain of others, as suggested by the final shot, is all too easily forgotten.
Rockwell's wounded, self-lacerating histrionics capture Glenn's rapid transformation from an eager-to-please guy to a frighteningly unstable personality, his cocktail of booze and religious fanaticism no less moving for being so misguided. Beckinsale firmly holds the screen against him, and her emotional range expands rewardingly as Annie's rejections of Glenn become angrier and more pronounced.
The challenge of adapting someone else's material has resulted in a more concrete, earthbound work than one expects from Green, with fewer Terrence Malick-like visual abstractions. Still, the camera (wielded by the helmer's regular d.p., Tim Orr) does lurch poetically skyward on occasion, while the beautiful outdoor photography extends Green's fascination with nature as a realm of beauty and danger, a place where men, women and children alike experience their final reckonings.

Stomping about on a frozen football field, shy trombonist Arthur Parkinson  (Michael Angarano ) and his high-school bandmates fumble their way through a rehearsal for an upcoming game. Unclenching his jaw, the conductor, Mr. Chervenick, unleashes a peevish motivational critique of their Peter Gabriel  number: "PEOPLE!? DO YOU HAVE A SLEDGEHAMMER IN YOUR HEART !?"
More than one false note is sounded in this portentous opening to Snow Angels , an unusually blunt melodrama by David Gordon Green , melodious poet of such sentimental delicacies as George Washington   and All the Real Girls . There's no mention of "sledgehammer" in the celebrated debut of novelist Stewart O'Nan , from which Snow Angels  has been adapted, but they agree on what comes next: a pair of gunshots, followed by a flashback narrative to account for them. O'Nan discloses the nature of this catastrophe on his fourth page; Green keeps mum until the end, charging his tale with an effective (if manipulative) aura of suspense.
Snow Angels ' cumbrous metaphorical overture develops into a full-blown symphony as the film cross-cuts between the emotional bludgeoning of two unhappy couples. Louise Parkinson  (Jeannetta Arnette ) is splitting with Don (Griffin Dunne ), a self-absorbed philander and science teacher at their son's school. Across town and miles further down the path of estrangement, Annie Marchand  (Kate Beckinsale ) has a restraining order against her alcoholic, suicidal, Jesus-freak ex-husband Glenn (Sam Rockwell ). Caught in the middle are Annie's young daughter and adolescent Arthur, whose burgeoning romance with Lila (Olivia Thirlby ), a quirky art chick, complicates the dramatic counterpoint of Snow Angels .
As always, Green's sympathies lie with his melancholy youngsters and, happily, his own heart is full of subtle instruments. The affair between Arthur and Lila is beautifully played—tender, restrained, honest, and good-humored, graced with wry, pitch-perfect dialogue that nails the defensive snark and vulnerability of the Juno  generation. "I like your shoes," Arthur offers without the slightest sarcasm. "What's wrong with them?" Lila snaps back.
Snow Angels  exhibits a mellowing—if not full abandonment—of Green's trademark emo-Malick mannerisms. His camera can't entirely resist an ersatz-'70s art effect here and there, but by and large he plays things straight, erratic as they become. What saves this heavy, heavy material from sinking into the chill, familiar turf of the Small-Town Midwinter Tragedy is his practiced ear for verbal idiosyncrasy and off-kilter conversation rhythms. Scenes tend to end a beat or two early, syncopated by a bit of whimsy or deadpan that skews the immediate tone and gives the movie a jittery forward thrust. Resolution is all the more satisfying, then, when the script calls for a sustained dramatic payoff or big emotional crescendo.
The film feels transitional for Green—one foot in the moody, interiorized indieverse of his previous work, the other taking a big step toward more conventional projects. In shaking off his influences and affections, will he shed imagination and intuition as well? Snow Angels  answers—with apt hesitancy—probably not.
