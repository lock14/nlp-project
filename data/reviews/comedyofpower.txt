 “Comedy of Power” is the name of Claude Chabrol’s latest film to be released in the United States, but the phrase could describe much of this director’s work. Though his films tend to be witty and ironical rather than laugh-out-loud funny, they often concern themselves with the behavior and misbehavior — both intimate and public — of the French ruling classes.  Criminality plays a large role in Mr. Chabrol’s view of the world, but rather than moralize, he treats his characters with a wry mixture of sympathy and cynicism. His touch is characteristically light, as if in defiance of the gravity of the stories he has occasion to tell, and his sensibility is aphoristically summed up by one of the characters in “Comedy of Power,” who suggests that “nothing is serious, and everything is tragic.”  This highly arguable observation gains a great deal by being said in French, with a smile, by a good-looking man (the actor is Mr. Chabrol’s 43-year-old son, Thomas) who has abandoned the possibility of an important administrative career to become a part-time maker of crossword puzzles.  “Comedy of Power” takes its inspiration from the Elf Aquitaine scandal of the 1990s, which exposed extensive corruption in France’s giant gas company, then state owned. The judge who led the Elf investigation, Eva Joly, is clearly the model for Jeanne Charmant Killman. Played by Isabelle Huppert, who has become something of a fixture in Mr. Chabrol’s cinematic universe, Jeanne is both admirable in her dedication and perhaps a little scary in her zeal.  Her first target is Michel Humeau (François Berléand), the director of a large company who never quite recovers from the shock and humiliation of being handcuffed, locked in a cell and otherwise treated like an ordinary criminal. Through his ordeal he repeats the plaintive rhetorical question that arises when influence turns into impotence: “Don’t you know who I am?”  Jeanne knows perfectly well, and in due course this unfortunate bigwig’s cronies, connections and superiors arrive, one by one, in her office. Like him, they try to flirt, flatter, threaten and condescend their way out of trouble. Mr. Chabrol’s discreet, prying camera takes note of the red filaments threaded into the lapels of their flashy suits — symbols of their membership in the Legion of Honor. Jeanne has only a cherished pair of red gloves, a token of retail feminine vanity rather than state-sanctioned masculine self-importance.  These chevaliers  of the Republic act like made guys in a Hollywood Mafia picture, conspiring over brandy and cigars and resorting to thuggishness when their oily attempts at charm fall short. The nature of their crimes is of less interest to Mr. Chabrol than the forms and protocols that guide their exercise of power, and their attempts to defend their imperiled privileges.  There is some talk of kickbacks and financial schemes, but procedural boilerplate is not really the point. Jeanne is sure that the targets of her investigation are guilty, and we are happy to accept her certainty as a warrant: how could they not be?  But public malfeasance is less the subject of the movie than its premise. It is not really a courtroom drama, or the stirring tale of a crusader against wrong, so much as it is the psychological portrait of an ambitious professional woman in a society still very much dominated by male prerogatives. Jeanne’s antagonists, used to pampering mistresses and deceiving wives, try to derail her with displays of chivalry and bald-faced lies as well as threats of violence, which they are too delicate to convey themselves.  The comedy arises in the confrontations between these fat cats and their sparrowlike tormentor, who is both punctilious with regard to legal procedure and capricious in the exercise of authority. “No smoking in my office,” she snaps, only to light up herself a few scenes later. At one point the bad guys arrange to have another female judge (Maryline Canto) assigned to the case, hoping for a bureaucratic catfight and forgetting the old feminist chestnut that sisterhood is powerful.  Mr. Chabrol’s observations of modern French sexual politics extend beyond Jeanne’s office into her home. Her husband (Robin Renucci), who is a doctor (and also the son of a wealthy and powerful family), complains that his colleagues call him “Monsieur Jeanne Charmant Killman,” and his wife’s highly public, possibly dangerous job soon places their marriage under a heavy strain, which pumps a bit of melodrama into the film’s otherwise dry air.  As ever, Mr. Chabrol’s style is delicate and precise. “Comedy of Power” is not his deepest or most ambitious film, and its stance of knowing resignation in the face of corruption can feel a little glib. But Ms. Huppert’s ferocity compensates for the director’s detachment; no French actress is as riveting to watch once the gloves come off. 

Lover Other: The Story of Claude Cahun and Marcel Moore

As often the case with films in which she appears, Isabelle Huppert is the chief pleasure in legal procedural "Comedy of Power," her seventh outing with helmer Claude Chabrol. Cat-and-mice tale of an examining magistrate on the trail of big cheeses who played fast and loose with company funds is recognizably inspired by a real-life scandal known as the "Elf Affair" (named after the French oil company). While pic may be too subtle and oblique in places for more general auds, it remains enjoyable as a sardonic glimpse of unspoken codes at the intersection of politics and business.
Judge Jeanne Charmant-Killman (Huppert) is an examining magistrate, a profession sometimes referred to as the most powerful in France. She can subpoena people, search premises without warning, seize goods and generally poke her nose into any corner where she believes she'll find evidence of abuse of position, influence, funds, etc.
Politicians and businessmen are in bed together, and Jeanne thinks it's high time somebody barged in and changed the sheets. But one man's dirty laundry is another man's (or government's) conception of standard operating procedure.
In opening scenes, multiple secretaries see to the special requests of Humeau (Francois Berleand). He's obviously an important guy with big weekend plans, but police are waiting outside with handcuffs. The outraged Humeau, who suffers from a skin allergy that obliges him to scratch himself constantly, keeps asking, "Don't you know who I am
?"
But France's justice system has little use for presumption of innocence and Jeanne has an awful lot of incriminating evidence that Humeau spent company money on travel, trinkets and pricey real estate for his mistress. Sibaud (Patrick Bruel), the arrogant young wolf who provided Jeanne with many useful leads, conveniently replaces Humeau at the office.
As Jeanne summons Humeau's well-connected associates and go-betweens, the case's notoriety lands her on the cover of magazines. She comes from a modest background in a country that tends to favor breeding over merit, so what seems like imminent victory over privilege-mongers appears doubly sweet.
Meanwhile, Jeanne's taciturn hubby, Philippe (Robin Renucci), a lab technician from an illustrious family, feels like he's living in the shadow of his increasingly famous spouse. He's particularly irked by the bodyguards Jeanne now requires.
The couple's nephew, Felix (Chabrol's son Thomas, in a delectable perf), offers the occasional insight as well as comic relief for his overworked aunt. His comfortable lack of ambition serves as a counterweight to her workaholism.
Wheras "All the President's Men," for instance, is simply about dedicated professionals bringing down people in high positions, Chabrol's pic deals with the very different French power landscape. Film posits that while ignorance of the law is no excuse, neither is ignorance of the unwritten rules of upper echelon chicanery: Just because Jeanne's on the right track doesn't mean she'll be allowed to keep driving the train.
In "Comedy of Power," the smug wrongdoers are all men and the judges are women. Scenes in which Jeanne questions witnesses in her tiny office at police headquarters are great fun. A string of Gallic character actors offer variations on ethical ambiguity that makes $800,000 in an envelope or a custom-built swimming pool seem like the big-business equivalent of the toy in a Happy Meal.
As always, helmer Chabrol delights in the permutations of human stupidity; the score by his son, Matthieu, neatly reinforces the tone. Lensing by ace d.p. Eduardo Serra (in his fifth go-round with Chabrol) anchors the ever-shifting game of one-upmanship in a Paris where even darkish dealings are bathed in natural light.

The firstand maybe the bestjoke in Claude Chabrol 's Comedy of Power comes before the credits: "Any resemblance to persons living or dead is, as they say, coincidental." OK, so it's not the knee-slapper it was in Primary Colors . But that wise-guy "as they say " is one of the few cracks in the master's deadpan as Chabrol conducts his own quietly amused inquiry into the biggest public scandal of postwar France: the rampant corruption and political chicanery within the state-owned Elf Aquitaine  oil company.
Enron  with a libido, the debacle known as "l'affaire Elf"  found high-living execs funneling away more than half a billion dollars, using bribes, kickbacks, expensive mistresses, and influence- peddling pillow talk to grease the pistons of commerce all the way to Taiwan . By the time the case went to trial in 2001, the Elf investigation, led by a tenacious juge d'instruction named Eva Joly , had laid open a network of alleged political fixing extending from Mitterrand to the party of German chancellor Helmut Kohl . But the company's upper-crust elite, with sympathetic peers at France's highest levels of government and industry, got off light.
Sex, money, threats, class warthe makings of juicy scandal-sheet entertainment are here, dripping ink and bile. Yet anyone who expects Enron-caliber rancor will be puzzled by Comedy of Power , an enjoyable but curiously weightless trifle that lowers rather than raises the temperature of the affair. Comedy of Power  has to be the most polite, untroubled conspiracy film since the genre first tapped a phone.
Chabrol focuses on the investigator, here named Jeanne Charmant-Killman . Like Judge Joly, she's an outsider by virtue of class, birth, and gender; she uses her cramped office and meager furnishings as a leveling agentproof to her upper-class targets that they've truly descended into hell. The director's best idea was to cast Isabelle Huppert , whose fierce concentration in any role can make a viewer feel like he's sweating through an IRS  audit. Head cocked, jaw set like the edge of a shoveland as alluring in her hot-for-teacher horn rims as Tina Fey Huppert makes a grand inquisitor.
The "comedy" results from the seesawing balance of power, as the unnamed company's masters of the universe are hauled from their perches in the sky to the bowels of the judge's chambers. Cha-brol and cinematographer Eduardo Serra  capture this plummet from fortune in one effortless two-and-a-half-minute opening shot. A god's-eye view of Paris pulls back to reveal Godthe company CEO, Humeau, played by François Berléand gazing out his office window before he heads for the elevator. The camera hesitates as he leaves the building, as if sensing the gendarmes waiting outside. Cue the credits. At the station house, the cops force the itchy big shot to drop troua humiliation that prompts the words "un film de Claude Chabrol."
There's little else disruptive about Comedy of Power , which works to its disadvantage. Chabrol directs with an unfussy economy honed over a 50-year career (and counting), but Comedy of Power is such a hermetic, tidily composed film that it evaporates almost as you watch it. Deliberately vague about the company and the import of its wrongdoingeither to avoid a legal tangle, or in the understandably cynical belief that any multinational conglomerate can fill in the blankthe movie keeps Elf's chilling political machinations offscreen, except for a chorus of cigar-chomping fat cats too cartoonish to take seriously.
Intended or not, the implication is that l'affaire Elf ultimately didn't matternot because the system it exposed was too powerful and deeply entrenched, but because it was essentially a victimless crime.
Even so, by draining the story of outrageeither from those appalled by Elf's costly transgressions, or from the many who considered Joly a wannabe Ken Starr Chabrol creates an unexpectedly humane portrait of bubble worlds in collision. Humeau and Jeanne eventually lose control of their spheres of influence, but powerlessness turns out not to be a tragedy. Neither does Comedy of Power except for the clowns left holding the reins of the world.
