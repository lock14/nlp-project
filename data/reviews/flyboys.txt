Remember ``Hell's Angels," the World War I dogfight movie that Howard Hughes was obsessed with in ``The Aviator"? They've effectively remade it as ``Flyboys," a high-altitude epic that repackages every aerial cliche in the playbook for an audience coming to them for the first time.
The movie's straightforward and ingratiating, and as pretty-boy history lessons go, it's a lot less obnoxious than ``Pearl Harbor." Still, you may wish they'd found some storytelling inspiration to match the onscreen gung-ho.
Purporting to tell the true story of the Lafayette Escadrille , the squadron of American volunteers who flew for the French during the early days of WWI (before the United States entered the war), ``Flyboys" hammers just enough tent pegs into the truth to build a believable encampment. For one thing, there actually were 
two tame lions who served as the squadron's mascots (the film merges them into one), and Eugene Skinner, the African-American flier played by Abdul Salis, is based on Eugene Bullard, history's first black military pilot.
Skinner is one of the crowd in ``Flyboys," and his squadron mates include the film's designated hunk, Blaine Rawlings (James Franco), a Texas boy looking for action after his farm forecloses; Jensen (Philip Winchester), a kid from a military family who has to come to grips with his fear; Beagle (David Ellison), a daredevil with a shady past; rich snob Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine); and Higgins (Christien Anholt), who's flying for the Lord. They're overseen by Captain Thenault (Jean Reno, who else?) and guided by Cassidy (Martin Henderson), a grizzled, cynical ace who has parachuted in from an old Howard Hawks movie.
``Flyboys" tells its tale as if proceeding by the Stations of the Flying Cross: There's the training sequence, the initial flights, the confrontation with a lethal German flier named the Black Falcon (Gunner Winbergh). A certain Corporal Lunchmeat (not his real name) is sacrificed to illustrate the dastardliness of the Hun. Blaine crashes into a provincial bordello and encounters the lovely Lucienne (Jennifer Decker), who -- Dieu merci
 -- is only dropping off fromage
 for the hard - working ladies. (Except for Cassidy, who has obviously read his Hemingway, none of our boys deigns to dally.)
All this is old, old stuff that has been handsomely filmed with attention to period detail; only the freshly scrubbed modernity of the cast -- the one thing that stands to put the film over with younger audiences -- rings false. The love scenes between Franco and Decker feel like kids playing dress-up; if you're looking for a recent WWI movie that conveys the passions and devastations of the era, rent 2004's ``A Very Long Engagement."
In any event, a flyboy movie exists for its flying sequences, and once it gets aloft, ``Flyboys" is reasonably ripping. Combining actual aerial footage and computer-generated special effects, the scenes have the dramatic crackle that's lacking on the ground, and the inclusion of deadly webs of CGI tracer-fire adds a new dimension to the swoops and rollovers and Immelmanns . I'll let the aviation-history wonks parse the realism of the bi planes; on action terms, the movie succeeds.
It succeeds so well that you spend the last 10 minutes hoping the screenwriters and director Tony Bill won't honor cliche a final time and have one character come in for a final shot of glory. They do, of course. What are the guns of Germany against all the stereotypes Hollywood can muster?


It's been a while since the last truly rousing WWI dogfight films: Wings  came out in 1927, Hell's Angels  in 1930. (No, 1966's The Blue Max  isn't good enough.) The time is ripe for a new ''Red Baron'' movie. Which makes Flyboys ' pedestrian drama  about a group of Yanks who move to France to battle tri-wing German fighters  and videogame lameness all the lamer: This is a lost opportunity on an epic scale. The actors are so styled and the dogfights so drippy with CG that, as a period piece, the movie almost looks like it's set in the future.

 Nostalgia carried beyond a certain point becomes a form of stupidity. And, as a poet once said, stupidity carried beyond a certain point becomes a public menace. “Flyboys” ascends close enough to this danger zone to singe its wings, yearning for a time when wars were fought by gentlemen, combat was glamorous and the French were amused by monolingual Americans.  Ostensibly, this would be the First World War as experienced by the Lafayette Escadrille, a pack of American boys who volunteered as Allied pilots before the United States entered the war. Under French command, they flew against the Germans in wood and canvas contraptions about as well engineered as a love seat from Ikea.  Of this history, “Flyboys” makes a soppy fantasy, representing war with approximately the level of realism marshaled by “Team America: World Police.” Leading the puppet people is James Franco as Blaine Rawlings, a cowboy with blond highlights who takes time off from killing to woo a French country girl (Jennifer Decker). Joining him are a blue blood (Tyler Labine), a black boxer (Abdul Salis), a screw-up (David Ellison) and Jean Reno as a French captain, hamming it up like a supersized croque monsieur.  Despite its empty head and arduous length, “Flyboys” is ever so nice, in the manner of a Norman Rockwell illustration. The director, Tony Bill, may not be a philosopher but he is a gentleman, moving things along with a tidy, well-mannered hand. In another context, such politesse might feel tonic. Given the state of things, it’s nearly toxic.  “Flyboys” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Frenzies of C.G.I. and squirts of fake blood.

"Flyboys" is an old-fashioned, boys' adventure version of an arresting chapter in World War I history about the enterprising bunch of young Americans who flew with the French before the United States entered the war. Lovingly and knowledgeably made by director Tony Bill, who got his pilot's license as a teenager, pic nonetheless has a lightweight, airbrushed feel; despite the brutal dogfights and inevitable deaths, there's little gravity or resonance. Flight film fans and the idly curious will check it out, but the masses won't be mobilized for this MGM release, at least not in theaters.
That not a single soul, not even a Frenchman, smokes in this film tells you pic's portrait of the war has been sanitized for modern consumption. Even the 1958 picture about the same unit, William Wellman's "Lafayette Escadrille," had the Yank leading man, played by Tab Hunter, fall for a French hooker; here, the love interest is a virtuous young thing who looks after her dead brother's orphaned kids.
Nearly all of the major Hollywood pictures about WWI aviators made in the late '20s and early '30s -- Wellman's "Wings" and "Legion of the Condemned," Hawks' "The Dawn Patrol," Howard Hughes' "Hell's Angels," William Dieterle's unduly neglected "The Last Flight" -- underline the bitter fatalism of these warriors who, while the most glamorous figures in uniform, had a life expectancy once they started flying of three to six weeks. They were beautiful stoics, alcoholic knights of the air, the poster boys for the Lost Generation; veteran pilots wouldn't even speak to new arrivals at first, knowing many of them would be dead in short order.
These tidbits are mentioned in the efficient but formulaic script by Blake Evans, Phil Sears and David S. Ward (the latter Bill's cohort from "The Sting"), but they come across as items on a checklist rather than as facts that might have shaped attitudes and contributed to a mildly despairing, pre-existential philosophy of life. "Flyboys" is intended as a 90-years-on salute to these adventurers, but its bright-eyed and bushy-tailed perspective denies the tale true grit or the barest hint of tragedy.
The small band of Yanks gathered together in 1916 have come to France for different reasons. Among them are Blaine Rawlings (James Franco), a laconic Texan whose family has just lost its ranch; William Jensen (Philip Winchester), a son of a soldier; Briggs Lowry (Tyler Labine), an upper class lout who needs to become a man; Eugene Skinner (Abdul Salis), a black expat boxer appreciative of how France has treated him; and Eddie Beagle (David Ellison), an odd fellow with a mysterious past.
Ensconced in a fabulous chateau, they train under the benevolent eye of Captain Thenault (Jean Reno, bearing more than a passing resemblance here to Charles de Gaulle) and at a detached distance from charismatic squadron leader Reed Cassidy (Martin Henderson). Director Bill's desire to communicate the minutiae of flying comes through vividly: The biplanes were rickety, fragile things, fabric pulled over wire and a few struts; the controls were dreadfully imprecise; the machine guns often jammed; flying and aiming at the same time was tough, and so much more did the military value the planes over the pilots that no parachutes were provided.
The aviation-yarn format requires several airborne missions separated by earthbound downtime, with the latter increasingly devoted to Rawlings' puppy dog devotion to lovely Lucienne (Jennifer Decker), whose life with the kids on a nearby farm becomes threatened by the encroaching Germans. The corny scenes between them are made agreeable enough by the actors' charm as well as by the way the characters slowly compensate for the fact that each speaks not a word of the other's language.
But the main action is in the air, where a vigorous combination of real footage and extensive CGI makes for dynamic and complicated maneuvers of the sort that are routine in outer space movies and videogames but haven't been seen before in WWI fare (with the momentary exception of "The Aviator"). In many interludes, it is impossible to tell where the six actual planes leave off and the computer-generated ones begin, and perhaps never has the difficulty of lining up a moving target in a wobbly plane and getting off an accurate shot been better demonstrated.
The film also shows the chaos of squadron-to-squadron combat. Bill placed great importance on expressing the chivalry and mutual respect between enemies in the air; pic's most upsetting moments come when the implicit aviators' code is transgressed by the German arch-villain.
But these genre niceties are not going to mean much to young modern audiences, and the vanilla-flavored storytelling fails to make the revisiting of a distant war relevant; the nostalgia is not unpleasant, but in terms of tough-mindedness, it's miles away from the trenchant entertainments that were embraced by the public not long after the war itself.
Franco's carryover James Dean posings early on serve his character's gruff coverup of a wounded soul, but the actor is best when he smiles and becomes personable. French stage thesp Decker is comely and promising, Salis has a sensitive, upbeat appeal as the initial odd man out who comes to love flying more than any of them, and Henderson obviously enjoyed draping himself in the accoutrements of romantic danger.
Shot in England, pic is handsomely and credibly appointed in all departments.

In Tony Bill 's romantic, computer-generated fantasy, the plucky volunteer pilots of World War I's Lafayette Escadrille are once more cast as "knights of the sky," dashing young Americans (James Franco , Martin Henderson , and Abdul Salis  among them) who soar aloft in flimsy wood-and-canvas biplanes, shoot down a glowering Hun or two over verdant France, then return to the chateau to quaff cognac and sing bawdy ballads in tribute to their fallen comrades. In other words, here is the War to End All Wars seen from on highas it was way back when, in Wings  or the Howard Hughes  Hell's Angels  a world apart from the grim, futile slaughterhouses of Verdun and the Marne. Among these combatants, you won't find much All Quiet on the Western Front style despair, and the paths of glory are unsullied by doubt or disillusionment. With Jennifer Decker  as a thankful mademoiselle and veteran Jean Reno  as the Americans' French commanding officer.
