         An obituary for eminent French writer Georges Bataille (1897-1962) stated that "he believed that through excess rather than deprivation one could obtain a freedom of the spirit," and in writer-director Christophe Honoré's film of Bataille's "Ma Mère" everyone believes in excess, the more wretched the better.
 
  That they're aiming for "freedom of the spirit" is not so clear. What is clear is that graphic displays of sadomasochistic sex can be a total turn-off, no matter how serious the intent may have been on the printed page or that they're presented here with a smidgen of discreet chic, leaving the most extreme behavior to the viewer's imagination. In other words, no matter how distinguished the author of the original novel, "Ma Mère" the movie is so much pretentious Eurotrash.
 


         






    Louis Garrel's Pierre is yet another pouty teenager who so often turns up in French pictures, both good and bad. He arrives at his parents' Canary Islands villa straight from his Catholic boarding school devoutly religious in spirit but caught up in mutually incestuous feelings with his coolly elegant mother, Hélène (Isabelle Huppert). Shortly thereafter his unhappy, unfaithful father (Philippe Duclos) takes off for Nice and his mistress and gets killed in a car accident.
 
  Whereupon Hélène turns Pierre over to her own mistress Réa (Joana Preiss), in preparation for what the woman really wants out of her son.
 
  "Ma Mère" unfolds with the utmost solemnity, and its characters are totally devoid of wit or humor and evince no interest in anything much beyond pursuing an endless round of joyless sex presented with a literalness that stops just short of hard-core porn. "Ma Mère" shows nothing most sophisticated audiences don't already know about — and don't care to see.

vid sensation-seeking in "Ma M�re" is such a grim affair that after a short while, the spectacle of its aimless characters bending themselves out of shape for the sake of alleged pleasure mutates from titillating to pathetic to laughable. And make no mistake: fun and pleasure are words these miserable people fling around with a deadly sense of mission. In the crowning joke of the movie, freely adapted from a late novel by the French moral theorist Georges Bataille, an anguished young teenager masturbates beside the corpse of his dead mother, who appears to have cut her own throat just as they were about to consummate their incestuous bond. On the soundtrack, the Turtles' 1967 hit, "Happy Together," bounces away cheerily. "Ma M�re" may be ludicrous, but its cast displays a commitment that deserves more than grudging admiration. The great French actress Isabelle Huppert, whose fondness for the transgressive has led her to star in movies like "The Piano Teacher" and "The School of Flesh," has finally shot the moon with this one. Here she is H�l�ne, a newly widowed, middle-aged sybarite who inhabits the family summer home in the Canary Islands, which she has turned into a multisexual orgy pad with attached swimming pool. With her down-turned mouth, burning gaze and insouciant flounce, Ms. Huppert is equal to the younger Jeanne Moreau in portraying an intense, unleashed sensuality; in Ms. Huppert's case, however, the source of heat seems to be a defiant, bottled-up rage. Louis Garrel (from "The Dreamers") matches her in disquieting power as Pierre, the manic-depressive 17-year-old son she corrupts in the name of what Bataille called a higher "hypermorality," whose principles suggest 20th-century tropes of the Marquis de Sade. Early in the film, H�l�ne announces to Pierre, who has been living with his grandmother and attending a Roman Catholic school in France, that the reason she has seen so little of him is that she is, in her own words, a bitch and a slut. Pierre's reaction is to run down to the beach in tears and pray. Over the course of this archetypally French Catholic movie, Pierre does a lot of weeping, praying and masturbating as H�l�ne competes with the Virgin Mary for his ultimate loyalty. H�l�ne's younger sidekicks in Pierre's secular education, Rea (Joana Preis) and Hansi (Emma de Caunes), are dedicated hedonists with whom she travels around the Mediterranean engaging in joyless sadomasochistic threesomes that involve bondage, boot-licking and verbal abuse. The movie offers a grotesque vision of the Canary Islands as a tourist mecca for predatory middle-aged Europeans with pierced body parts and pot bellies on the prowl for sex. The screenplay is punctuated by H�l�ne's big pronouncements. "I want you to love me for the shame I inspire in you," she tells her son. "The pleasure only begins the moment the worm is in the fruit," she declares. "We must together refuse the world of those who patiently await death to enlighten them," she instructs. In the film's pretentious production notes, the writer and director Christophe Honor� muses windily about the problems of turning the theoretical fiction of an author who died in 1962 into a contemporary movie that still leaves its ideas intact. But the images in "Ma M�re" are so much more powerful and fixed than the fluid ones in our imaginations that the physical reality of the characters trumps the highfalutin verbiage. The film's philosophy plays out on the screen as lessons on how to ruin lives - your own and everyone else's - in the pursuit of depravity. "Ma M�re" is rated NC-17 (No one under 17 admitted). It has nudity, simulated sex and graphic language.
"I don't want your love unless you know I am repulsive," intones the luxuriantly dissolute matriarch to her teenage son in Georges Bataille 's 1966 novella Ma Mère . This week's pair of formidable mothers superior turn cartwheels on the thin line between love and hate, transforming into rapacious gargoyles in a fiery apotheosis of self-abnegating devotion to their flummoxed mama's boys (only children both!). They're also, as embodied by Jane Fonda  and Isabelle Huppert , smolderingly fine, twin ideals of burnished autumnal womanhood. In the jackbooted farce Monster-in-Law , Fonda's suddenly jobless TV news queen channels all of her displaced type-A mania into derailing her son's engagement, while in Christophe Honoré 's literal-minded Bataille adaptation, Huppert's recently widowed lady of leisure works through her grief by inducting junior into her nightclub society of sordid sexual compulsion. As British talk show axiom Trisha Goddard  would quip, "That's mothering with a capital S ."
Essentially Meet the Parents  redux with Fonda in the scarifying De Niro role, Monster-in-Law  marks a continuation of Jennifer Lopez 's affinity for chaste, earthy gals in low-level employment who innocently snag pale males with fat wallets. Her Charlie is a cheerful, unambitious temp who always awakens in full makeup, a believer in karma and walker of dogs. Perhaps mindful of any dissonance with her supersize public persona, Lopez overcompensates with a squeaky little-girl cutesiness that may divert more sympathy to the titular she-beast's corner than intended. Apparently, J.Lo also has a clause in her contract obligating each of her directors to a Bottom-Dollar Shot, here occasioned when Charlie's prospective mother-in-law cruelly gives her a tiny frock that fits like a sausage casing over her lingeringly showcased derriere. "I have two asses," wails Charlie. If only! One could launch Lo's latest fragrance while the other tours with Marc Anthony .
Sabotage by couture is the least of the guerrilla tactics deployed against Charlie by Fonda's Viola, a Walters-esque media doyenne left with far too much time on her bejeweled hands after she's toppled from her throne by a demographically correct bimbo. Millionaire Viola is enraged that her blandly handsome surgeon offspring, Kevin (Michael Vartan ), is marrying down; he impulsively asks for Charlie's hand in front of Mom, a decent indicator of just how close these home fires burn. Handy with her fists, possessed of a soul-freezing witchy cackle, the single-minded Viola guzzles cough syrup at crisis moments and doesn't blanch at photo surveillance or poisoning the gravy. (Fonda says she based the character on ex-husband Ted Turner .)
Legally Blonde  director Robert Luketic  bumbles along with typically clumsy blocking and framing, and the misogyny inherent in the three-ring spectacle of bitch slaps, barbiturate covert ops, and wedding plan hysteria does rankleCharlie really loses her shit when Viola arrives at her ceremony wearing white . All the same, hail the conquering heroine Fonda, absent from the big screen for 15 years, looking supernaturally fabulous at 67those eyes! those legs! and delivering a relaxed yet utterly committed performance in humble service of a little marketing synergy with her autobiography. Tapping comic gifts that have lain fallow for the quarter-century since 9 to 5 , Fonda forges a spirited rapport with an ad-libbing Wanda Sykes ; as Ruby, Viola's long-suffering personal assistant, the redoubtable Sykes coolly dismantles her Sassy Black Sidekick role with a level gaze and killer timing.
"I always thought that Kevin looked like Jesus," Viola muses in just one of many lines calculated to send Charlie screaming for the hills. In Ma Mère , the churchgoing good son Pierre (Louis Garrel ) endures a passion of sorts, dragged along on a self-mortifying, crypto-religious quest for ultimate transgression and totalized carnal abjection, as personified by his godlike Maman, all-knowing in her "perfect depravity." That's at least the arguable gist of Bataille's perhaps unadaptable book, which director Honoré translates on-screen as an interminable back-and-forth of joyless orgasmic frenzy and postcoital vacationers' lull. On holiday in the Canaries, Pierre's sad-sack father dies, and red-hot Mom (Huppert, sleepwalking through another affectless-hedonist role) responds with a series of assignments for her son: Clear out Papa's office, fuck this girl in public while I watch, etc.
Lurching toward its inevitable incestuous showdown, Ma Mère  makes a few hilarious attempts at the cerebral (one philosophical inquiry begins, "If I love Hansi's ass so much . . . ") but can't transcend its own suffocating milieu, a moneyed purgatorio  where spoiled brats exorcise their demons by pissing on Dad's nudie-mag stash and firing the help in a drunken snit. Like Monster-in-Law , Ma Mère  goes down easiest as a strong antidote to class envyit's a relief to discover that idle wealth is an intractable state of miserable, deranging torpor.
