With a lazy, clich�, rabid plot and paper-thin character development, Because I Said So
 might as well have been directed by a trained chimpanzee. Which is unfortunate to say about director Lehmann whose r�sum� includes Heathers
 and the guilty pleasure Airheads
. But there is no pleasure to be found here, only guilt. Lots and lots of guilt. The perpetually single mom, Daphne (Keaton), is wildly overbearing. After marrying off her first two daughters (Perabo and Graham), she makes it her mission in life to find Mr. Right for her somewhat flighty youngest, Milly (Moore). So she does what any over-the-top meddling movie mom would do and places a personal ad, which reads, "Mother seeks life partner for daughter." After interviewing the usual parade of stereotyped movie geeks, Daphne settles upon a supposed gem (Scott), who also happens to be obsessive, anal, and totally wrong for the free-spirited Milly. Meanwhile, Milly meets rock & roll single father Johnny (Macht), a doting Mr. Perfect. Mom then proceeds to bully her daughter into dating Mr. Wrong, and the result is that Milly continues to see both guys simultaneously. Sure, dating two guys at the same time can be both good comedy and compelling drama, but here it just comes off as selfish and sad. So much so that after Milly�s two-timing is inevitably uncovered, I couldn�t help but cheer while she received a much-deserved dumping-on. But the loose plot is more of a frame on which to hang the series of sappy scenes and frankly offensive mother-daughter sexual banter. Do you really want to see Keaton giggle when her daughter talks about how good his kisses were �downstairs�? Both Macht (The Good Shephard)
 and Moore (American Dreamz)
 are somewhat charming, Collins (Seventh Heaven)
 is entertaining as the easygoing father, and the always-wonderful Hale (Arrested Development
) is repeatedly funny. But the plot is about as revelatory as a bad Hallmark card, and the lowest common denominator humor results in a moviegoing experience that�s almost as appealing as having a conversation with my mother about orgasms.


The new romantic comedy "Because I Said So" has no flesh and no blood. It's made of sugar, spice, and lavender, less something you'd find at a movie theater and more what you'd order by the ounce at Teavana .
Diane Keaton plays Daphne Wilder , a long-divorced Los Angeles baker determined to pair off her daughter Milly (Mandy Moore), a caterer. She's the youngest of three daughters and the only one who's still unwed. Daphne places an epic online personal ad, then arranges for an ultra-yuppie architect (Tom Everett Scott ) to sweep Milly off her feet. Meanwhile, the musician/single dad (Gabriel Macht ) who expresses interest, pursues Milly despite mommy's objections. When the fudge hits the fan, mom justifies it all by explaining that she just loves her daughter too much not to lie to her and manipulate her into companionship.
I left this movie devastated. Not because it's one of the worst films ever made about having a mother, dating two men, or catering (although on all three fronts, it is). I was upset because my own mother apparently doesn't love me enough to connive dates for me, especially while wearing little sunglasses around the house and absurd layers of clothes always -- always
 -- topped off with a ginormous belt, the way Keaton does.
Feeling inadequately obsessed over, I called home and demanded an explanation: Why no sneaky setups with perfect men, m
om
? Why no anaconda-size belts, huh? "Because I'm not crazy," she said. "You can make your own matches." She went on to explain that she failed to see the need to lie if she ever did want to set me up, anyway.
Of course, deception is the only way to get this movie past the 60-minute mark. The script's various ruses require maximum stupidity on Milly's part. Even after the film displays a remedial obviousness in telling her (and us) which of these two men is worth keeping, she seems torn. In one scene with the yuppie, Milly breaks one of his family heirlooms, and he snaps at her. In the very next scene with the musician, she drops some dishes; he comforts her. But no light goes off in her head. Not only does this character not have a bulb, she's missing a socket, too. Moore does have one fantastic flash of positive self-realization, but this immensely lik able woman is required to be a nitwit.
Eighteen years ago, the director Michael Lehmann helped bring us "Heathers," a smart anti-chick-flick flick. The renegade teens in that movie would have snarled at the whiny woman in "Because I Said So." It's unfortunate that he's swilling the industry Kool-Aid now, eking out would-be romantic-comic contraptions. This is a sloppily made bowl of reheated chick-flick cliche s. There are the obligatory inappropriate-suitor montage and the depressing overreliance on a cute canine for many reaction shots. The Wilders drop in on department stores like a quartet of yammering cluster bombs, and subject the Korean day-spa staff to their vapid family dramas. (Piper Perabo and the priceless Lauren Graham , who takes the least conventional approach to this material by taking none of it to heart, play -- alliteration alert! -- Mae and Maggie, the two married daughters.)
Firmly in middle age, Keaton seems more popular and glamorous than ever. But the movies she stars in keep getting lousier. "Because I Said So" isn't nearly as good as "Something's Gotta Give" and "The Family Stone," which were mediocre. Here she doesn't transcend the overbearing material with brilliant facial acrobatics or wry goodness as she did, respectively, in those other two movies.
In fact, she's required to be overbearing herself, a trait that betrays what's best about her unique brand of comedy, which erases the line between prideful self-confidence and crippling self-doubt. In "Because I Said So," Keaton is accidentally sad. And I haven't even mentioned the odd scene where Milly has to explain to poor, laryngitis-afflicted mom what she's been missing in bed all these years. (Women's-studies classes will have a field day with Keaton's having literally lost her voice in this moment.) I wish that she and her pal Nora Ephron would consider tailoring a few of Ephron's essays in "I Feel Bad About My Neck" for the movies.
In the meantime, watching the generations team up (even unwittingly) in the search for love, I was reminded that "Because I Said So" is a movie of its moment. On MTV's "Parental Control," moms and dads, disgruntled with their offspring's current mate, interview more suitable suitors. And on VH-1's "I Love New York," a charismatic, street wise chick from Syracuse, nicknamed New York, and her steely mother sift through a cast of nerds, players, and thugs to find the daughter's prince.
That entertaining show is about the balancing act between keepin' it real and real love. "Because I Said So" exasperates because even its best intentions are phony. When one of Milly's smitten suitors tells her, "I love that when I breathe you in, you smell of cake batter," you can imagine New York's mother kicking that dude to the curb.


         Not long into "Because I Said So," which stars Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore as a mother and daughter bound by a mutual dependence so neurotically obsessive it makes the affair in "Last Tango in Paris" look breezy and wholesome, I was reminded of the pancake-wrapped sausage that Jon Stewart has been waving around lately on "The Daily Show."
 
  It may not seem immediately apparent, but "Because I Said So" and breakfast-on-a-stick share a great deal in common: a fresh-from-the-R&D-lab quality common to food that's engineered to be "fun" but is actually sad, an utter lack of nutritional value combined with a surfeit of kidney-macerating toxins — they combine certain recognizable properties that have been distorted into something unrecognizable and scary.
 


         






    Keaton is like the sausage too, as she has been reduced to a set of basic features (neurotic isolation, emotional frigidity, clumsiness) served up in the most infantilizing manner. After the injury of the movie will no doubt come the insult of negative reviews that will nonetheless predict a modest success with female audiences. A depressing example of what passes for a "woman's picture" in a not exactly woman-friendly media era, it's the kind of mother-daughter movie you can take your mother to (I did), only to have her take offense at the condescension and wonder "how the smart, professional people who supposedly made it can look at that and think it's good."
 
  The story hinges on Milly Wilder's (Moore) knack for picking bad-news boyfriends and her mother Daphne's (Keaton) fear that she'll wind up alone like her. To avert Milly's imminent spinsterhood, Daphne places a personal ad, then settles into a hotel bar for the afternoon to interview candidates worthy of her daughter. A handsome musician named Johnny (Gabriel Macht), looks on as Daphne suffers through the requisite gallery-of-losers montage, eventually stepping in to save her. But Daphne only has vicarious eyes for Jason (Tom Everett Scott), a smug and bossy architect. Jason's Zen loft, we know, will prove no match for Johnny's cozy Venice bungalow, adorably foul-mouthed moppet and sexy dad (Stephen Collins), whose sexiness will not be wasted.
 
  That's the story, such as it is, but it's obscured by the emotional abuse that passes for mother-love in the film. As a caterer, Daphne's specialty seems to be the precarious transportation of large cakes through very busy areas, with predictably disastrous results. As a mother, she is shrill, meddling, overprotective and pathologically controlling. Or rather, this is the generous picture of her I got from the press materials. After watching the movie, I was convinced that Daphne had been trained in psychological torture methods by the Brazilian army. (I even think I recognized at least one effective tactic from an excellent documentary on Abu Ghraib I saw at Sundance.)
 
  Daphne sends Milly off to flirt with handsome strangers with last-minute reminders of her physical flaws and encourages her to remember her shortcomings when selecting a mate. Milly responds to Daphne's constant intrusions by telling her mother she loves her 10 times per conversation, a troubling verbal tic I'm confident experts would identify as a symptom of Stockholm syndrome.
 
  Directed by the once (as in one time) inspired Michael Lehmann, whose epochal 1989 "Heathers" helped change the tenor of girl-centric movies, and written by Karen Leigh Hopkins and Jessie Nelson, who gave us "Stepmom," "Because I Said So" is not so much phoned in as it is auto-dialed with a text-to-speech prerecorded message in one of those creepy robotic voices.
 
  From its very first sequence — a wedding triptych in which her two elder daughters are married off while her youngest is apparently consigned to follow in her mother's own wedding-catering, perennially single footsteps — the movie sets about to methodically trace every romantic comedy cliché in the book. Keaton and Moore shriek, squeal, bicker and continually run afoul of pastry. Elder daughters Maggie (Lauren Graham), a psychologist, and Mae (Piper Perabo), a nymphomaniac, constantly shock mom with the raunchy details of their sex lives. (After the screening, the ladies' restroom was abuzz with the theory that no woman could have ever written the screenplay, because not a woman on Earth would be that graphic in front of her mother.)
 
  From the first cake-in-the-face to the final public declaration of love, which takes place during a cooking class for seniors and inspires a spontaneous septuagenarian orgy, "Because I Said So" rejects recognizable (and therefore funny) human behavior for a formula so trite it became self-parodic long ago. Watching it, you can't help but wonder why anyone bothers. But maybe there's a clue in the title — joyless and rote, it feels like the grim execution of orders, the foot-stomping compliance to arbitrary rules that make no sense.

In her mature beauty, her self-effacing wit, and the fashion-forward wardrobe that distinguishes her in fashion-backward Hollywood, Diane Keaton displays a flair that has won her an army of lifelong devotees. I'm a charter member. In Because I Said So , Keaton has unfortunately decided that self-caricature is as good as it gets to sustain the affection heaped on her after Something's Gotta Give : Her clothes are as cool as ever, but her character, Daphne  a divorced mother of three grown daughters (Lauren Graham, Piper Perabo, Mandy Moore) who meddles neurotically in the love life of her youngest girl, Milly (Moore)  is an unbelievable mess. I mean actually unbelievable, a blur of romantic-comedy foibles (she's a ditz at technology, afraid of romance herself ) nevertheless costumed with the confidence of a babe who'd give, say, Jack Nicholson a run for his money. (Stephen Collins subs for Jack as Joe, the guy who breaches Daphne's sexual defenses and high-neckline garb while Milly cozies up to Gabriel Macht as Joe's son.)
Daphne is the dumb girl's Keaton of Hanging Up  rather than the thinking woman's Keaton of Something's Gotta Give . And this slapdash, charmless, baldly boomer-chasing romantic comedy, directed by Michael Lehmann (Heathers ) from a clunky, orgasm-obsessed script by Karen Leigh Hopkins and Jessie Nelson, is the lazy studio's answer to a call for more age-appropriate entertainment for More  magazine readers.


An exercise in canned cuteness, "Because I Said So" pushes its normally appealing stars, Diane Keaton and Mandy Moore, over the edge of sitcom hysteria. Formulaic, strained comedy should do OK with femme-skewed auds amid late-winter doldrums, but it's the kind of movie whose bigscreen career seems like a formality before finding its true home on the tube.
Script by thesps-turned-scribes Karen Leigh Hopkins and Jessie Nelson ("Stepmom") feels composted from umpteen prior flicks, including several ("Hanging Up," "The First Wives Club") that involved Keaton herself.
The deft, distinctive comedic style Keaton has evidenced many times before becomes broad, fussy shtick here, while the quirkiness that helmer Michael Lehmann has brought to the better films ("Heathers," "The Truth About Cats and Dogs") gives way to generic gloss and pandering yuks.
Daphne Wilder (Keaton) raised her three daughters alone after their father jumped ship early on. As a result, perhaps, she's overprotective to the point of invasiveness -- particularly with youngest child Milly (Moore), who, unlike her married sibs (played by Lauren Graham and Piper Perabo), has yet to find Mr. Right. Daphne (whose gourmet cooking skills fostered Milly's own catering career) doesn't realize her well-intentioned "advice" and fussing do more to undermine Milly's self-confidence than to advance her happiness.
On a whim, Daphne places an online personal ad on her daughter's behalf, screening the answering bachelors herself in a somewhat racially offensive montage of "loser" candidates. But she finds apparent prospective-husband gold in architect Jason (Tom Everett Scott).
She also meets easygoing Johnny (Gabriel Macht), a musician who plays at the upscale bar-restaurant where she holds these interviews. Latter is charming, but strikes her as by far the less stellar candidate. Johnny manages to meet Milly on his own, however, striking up a romance that awkwardly develops in tandem with her courtship by yuppie dreamboat Jason.
Contrast between the two suitors is tepid at best, since Jason is a bland nice guy with minor control issues and Johnny perhaps the most supportively rock-steady Prince Charming of a professional musician since Liam Neeson's jazzbo pined for Keaton's "The Good Mother." Meanwhile, Daphne finds surprising autumnal sparks flying when she meets Johnny's dad Joe (Stephen Collins, who played Keaton's cheating husband in "First Wives").
No rom-com cliche is left unturned, from slapstick (many cakes meet face) to cute canine reaction shots from Daphne's Golden Lab and bratty precociousness from the young son of single dad Johnny. Not one but two opportunities are afforded for the four female leads to "spontaneously" belt (poorly, Moore aside) classic soul oldies. Progress predictably shades from broad to treacly, then reverts to unsubtle yuks just in time for the inevitable wedding climax.
Best moments in Keaton's over-the-top performance occur during the character's bout of laryngitis -- though even then, her hand gestures are frenetic to an aerobic-workout degree. Moore likewise doesn't seem to be inhabiting a character so much as living up to some preconceived notion of fluttery sitcom mannerism. Scott, Macht and Collins benefit from the fact that pic allows its men to act in a relatively natural fashion.
Hamfisted music cues, highly art-directed apartment "clutter" and a warm if routinely glossy color palette complete pic's familiar lifestyle fantasy.


Though I'm sure it's purely coincidental, the decision to release the Diane Keaton Mandy Moore  rom-com Because I Said So with the scent of this year's Sundance Film Festival  still fresh in the air provides us with an excellent opportunity to review the wayward career of the movie's director, Michael Lehmann . Once upon a time1989 to be exactLehmann came to Park City  with his first feature film, a gruesomely funny high-school satire called Heathers, and, like so many neophytes before and after him, dreamed of spinning that early success into a long and prosperous Hollywood  career. The sheer volume of his film and television output since then would suggest that Lehmann has accomplished exactly that. But take a closer look at the work (which includes the forgettable romantic comedies The Truth About Cats & Dogs and 40 Days and 40 Nights ) and he starts to seem like an object lesson in being careful for what you wish.
Because I Said So  is no exception; like nearly all of Lehmann's post- Heathers  work, it's lazy and disinteresteda hack-for-hire job any number of film-school grads could have put through its uninspired paces. Set in and around Los Angeles, the film stars Keaton as Daphne Wilder, a divorced, in-demand caterer whose booming wedding business has done little to persuade her youngest daughter, Milly (Mandy Moore), to tie the knot. And so Daphne, closing in on 60 and worried that Milly too might end up old and alone, does what any concerned parent would: She places an Internet personal ad seeking her ideal son-in-law and then proceeds to screen potential candidates for the job. Cue musical montage of variously unattractive, socially graceless, allergy addled, and otherwise ill-suited applicants.
The cream of Daphne's crop turns out to be dreamboat architect Jason (Tom Everett Scott ) who exudes WASP-y privilege and, as everyone save for Daphne can see, might as well have "asshole" stamped on his forehead. The fly in Daphne's ointment, meanwhile, is a hipster musician named Johnny (Gabriel Macht ), whose boho charms do little to endear him to Mom, but who we know is really the guy to root for because he's chosen the artist's life over the world of corporate conformityeven if it is  a lifestyle made possible by the fact that Johnny still lives at home with Dad. Milly starts dating him too, and from there, Lehmann and screenwriters Karen Leigh Hopkins  and Jessie Nelson  (the duo responsible for the equally insipid Stepmom ) make some half-hearted stabs at door-slamming farce as they limp toward that inevitable "gotcha" moment at which all the characters discover what's really going on and Daphne's whole duplicitous house of cards comes tumbling down.
Despite the movie's best efforts to turn him into a sort of Chet Baker  caricature, Macht has a sly charm and a natural chemistry with Moore (who is sufficiently charming, but little else, in a far less rewarding role than she had in Saved! and American Dreamz ). But Because I Said So is finally a work of comic desperation, and an especially cruel betrayal of Keaton, who looks radiant in her sixties yet keeps finding herself cast in roles that use her age as the foundation for cut-rate slapstick. First there was Nancy Meyers 's Something's Gotta Give , in which the sight of a naked Keaton was enough to send Jack Nicholson  into a bout of hysteria. Now there is this film, in which it is Keaton who's in panic mode, projecting her own romantic failings on to her child and, in one unfortunate recurring gag, getting her computer accidentally stuck on the same porn website (while her dog compulsively pleasures himself). And when Lehmann can't humiliate Keaton any further, what does he do? Why, assemble the cast for a group song, of course. Let this be a warning to all who would follow in his footsteps.
