I like Vin Diesel. I really do. He can be brusque and warm; he�s got a slight lisp. He can breakdance. There�s room for him in comedy. He seems sincere even when he�s doing something risible, and this Disney family farce has plenty of risible tasks for him: pilot a jet ski in pursuit of "a group of Serbian rebels"; wrestle with Kane in full madcap mode as a Czech nanny; use baby powder, hula hoops, and a toddler play-tunnel as weapons. Is it funny? Not for a minute. Cross-pollinate Kindergarten Cop
 with Home Alone 3
, and you still have a hardier hybrid than this Mouse mutt. Not even Kid in the Hall Scott Thompson, as a Birkenstocked drama coach making step-ball-change jokes, can pull this movie out of the vortex of suckitude. We begin with The O.C.
�s Tate Donovan kidnapped on a boat and somehow end up with Diesel in charge of his kids (Snow, Thieriot, Morgan York, and two sets of baby twins) while their mother (plastically perky Ford) searches for a high tech McGuffin in Switzerland. Military flourishes dot the soundtrack while Diesel � a SEAL � whips off diapers and whips the family into shape. I suppose there is some pleasure to be had in watching Diesel make trips to Costco and train Fireflies in kung fu. There may be some pleasure to be had in watching the world of motherhood temporarily confound a Big Strong Competent Man. (Allow me to stress "temporarily.") Gilmore Girls
� Graham is the perfunctory love interest, Garrett the perfunctory suburban villain. (Yes, this is the kind of movie in which a 7-foot-tall hairy man in wrestling garb barely registers.) The juvenile thespians are rather likable, as well. Thieriot demonstrates a certain vulnerability as the inevitably misunderstood sensitive adolescent son, and York is appropriately spunky as the aforementioned Firefly. But you never forget that these are Movie Kids living in a Movie Scenario. It makes sense that the script is so antic � it was directed by two alumni of The State
 � but the problem is that it�s so synthetic, so absolutely by-the-book in its trajectory. Backstories will be exchanged in a revealing moment of candor on a balcony, and our hero will of course learn the true value of Family. Perhaps in some parallel universe this movie could be an edgier satire of how families live and how children are educated, and the intrigue plot could be fully realized as a big goofy joke, but Shankman (Bringing Down the House)
 isn�t up for that. He walks the line between wholesome and wacky and ends up with the cinematic equivalent of a minivan.


''The Pacifier" is to Vin Diesel exactly as ''Kindergarten Cop" was to Arnold Schwarzenegger: an attempt to sand the sharp edges off a movie tough guy and show he can play cute with the kids. Fine, but since Diesel is already a B-movie version of Arnold, and since the movie plays like it was cobbled together from sheetrock and carpet tacks, this makes ''The Pacifier" just
 worth your children's time, and hardly worth yours.
The setup is formulaic and, as these things go, foolproof. Macho Navy SEAL Shane Wolf is assigned to guard the Bethesda, Md., clan of a deceased Pentagon scientist while the widow (Faith Ford) travels to Europe to look for evidence of her husband's Big Invention, a gizmo that jams missile launches. Shane's also on the lookout for this MacGuffin at home, but when the kooky Czech baby sitter (Carol Kane, paying the rent) ups and quits, he's forced into such duties as nappy-changing and curfew-enforcing.
The big joke is -- are you ready? -- Shane hates children
. And they hate him, ''they" being sullen proto-punker Seth (Max Theriot), shopaholic dingbat Zoe (Brittany Snow; parents, please
 stop naming your children after French departements
), sassy tweener Lulu (Morgan York), random toddler Peter (twins Keegan and Logan Hoover), and baby Tyler (twins Bo and Luke Vink), the latter specializing in fluid leakage from both ends.
''The Pacifier" leaks an awful lot of fluid, too, all the more so toward the end, when it turns sentimental and weird. Shane and the kids come around to each other, of course, and his military discipline turns out to be just what these latchkey brats need -- the film's part of the same indulgent-parent guilt trip that has produced TV's heinous ''Nanny 911." He also foils a couple of North Korean ninja bad guys who are after the gizmo, which only proves that Arabs are now officially out as go-to bad guys for lame Hollywood movies.
There's nothing wrong with a tough-guy/cute-kid flick when it's competently done, and, indeed, individual segments of ''The Pacifier" are as funny as one might hope: Shane teaching Lulu's Brownie troop the proper martial arts moves to deal with a posse of thuggish Boy Scouts, or a bit involving Seth and a Nazi armband that you think can't possibly end well yet manages to pay off cleverly. There's also a pet duck whose one funny scene is in the trailer.
Too many other sequences are just bizarre, including the James-Bond-in-the-garage climax and any and all scenes involving Brad Garrett of ''Everybody Loves Raymond." He plays a blowhard sadist of a wrestling coach who has it in for Seth and who's amusingly dispatched on the mat by Shane. Garrett plays the role far over the top, while Lauren Graham (of TV's ''Gilmore Girls") stands around itching to do something mischievous in the rote part of the school-principal love interest.
They're both left high and dry by Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant's script, even sloppier and more nonsensical than the one they wrote for the Jimmy Fallon/Queen Latifah retread ''Taxi." Adam Shankman's direction, meanwhile, fails even at the simple task of connecting the movie's prefabricated pieces. He's great at covering his star in poo, though, and Diesel, who still seems like the luckiest shopping mall security guard on earth, wears it like it's perfume.
Who knows? Maybe it is, given that current DVD sales of ''family product" guarantee this barely professional time-waster a place in every rec room. Will your children enjoy it? Probably; mine liked it well enough. Everyone else will recognize it as the lazy grab for mommy and daddy's hard-earned cash it is.


         As "The Pacifier" opens, Navy SEAL Shane Wolfe (Vin Diesel) attempts a daring rescue of a kidnapped scientist. Single-handedly, Wolfe scoops up the man from a cabin cruiser and hauls him aboard a helicopter when all hell breaks loose.
 
  The next thing Wolfe knows, he's assigned to guard the late scientist's five children while their mother is off to a Swiss bank to retrieve her husband's secret invention, a highly advanced security system strongly coveted, of course, by America's enemies.
 


         






    This is an amusing prologue to a picture that has sufficient mayhem to please Diesel's action fans while allowing the star to reach out to family audiences. The children, to whom the scientist's widow (Faith Ford) reveals the full extent of the danger they may be in, resent Wolfe's taking over their household and running it in strict military fashion. The five children range in age from high schoolers to a baby, and the three oldest rebel. But Wolfe is no pushover, not even when the baby's comically feisty Romanian nanny (Carol Kane) decamps. A man in whom a sense of responsibility is deeply instilled, Wolfe is swiftly up to his ears in dirty diapers, chauffeuring duties, running a household and, without realizing it, becoming a dedicated parent, all the while alert to constant danger.
 
  Director Adam Shankman and writers Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant have lots of fun with "The Pacifier's" premise, and they run with it — even getting away with Wolfe taking over the direction of a community theater production of "The Sound of Music." The attraction between Wolfe and the children's principal (Lauren Graham) is instant, but Shankman and his writers don't let it become a distraction, just as they refrain from allowing Wolfe to have an immediate standoff with the school's oafish pseudo-macho VP and wrestling coach (Brad Garrett) and trust the audience to sense there will be an inevitable showdown.
 
  "The Pacifier" is briskly paced but never feels rushed, which allows Wolfe to develop a real relationship with his charges. The eldest three are played by Brittany Snow, Max Thieriot and Megan York, all of whom emerge as distinct individuals. The film is a reminder that, as with more specialized fare, it takes artistry and skill to pull off even the most mainstream movies.

ny Navy Seal is equipped with the latest in freedom-fighting gadgetry. Straps, pockets and belts hold guns, grenades and various homing devices. The primary visual gag in "The Pacifier" involves one Seal on a top-secret baby-sitting mission who retrofits his  weapon-holders to keep baby formula and diapers at the ready. In this movie, Similac is as precious as Semtex, and bottle fatigue is akin to battle fatigue. Disney's new family flick is chipper and occasionally clever as it sends up the high-tech know-how required by 21st-century parents. In this case, a professor who has invented a mysterious microchip dies at the hands of terrorists. With the victim's wife away on a mission of her own, the government sends in a one-man security force: the fearless Shane Wolfe is deemed adaptable enough to serve this fatherless family. Playing the special-ops warrior with a heart-thawing assignment, Vin Diesel turns his thuggish frown upside down and lends his nasal hoarseness to a cloying lullaby. In that sense and many others, the action-picture hero's image-modifying role looks much like the former gangsta rapper Ice Cube's recent road-trip-with-kids movie ("Are We There Yet?") or the craggy Tommy Lee Jones's latest mission as a protector of cheerleaders ("Man of the House"). Mr. Diesel could not have succeeded as a genre-switcher without the proven television talents of the film's able ensemble. Brittany Snow, the teenage star of "American Dreams," plays the eldest daughter, who at first is Shane's in-house enemy No. 1. ("Whoa. Personal bubble invasion!" she yells when he comes in close to chastise her bratty behavior.) Faith Ford, of "Hope & Faith," and Lauren Graham, of "The Gilmore Girls," give an Ivory-girl glow to the cast's maternal figures. Carol Kane, of "Taxi," as a messy nanny, and Brad Garrett, of "Everybody Loves Raymond," as a Barney Fife-ish vice principal, clown it up as feckless scolds and come to rather sadistic ends. The film, directed by Adam Shankman ("Bringing Down the House"), suggests that children should talk about their grief and show respect for overtaxed parents. But its prevailing lesson, one that will instruct children in the audience and delight their ticket-buying parents, is the value of discipline. "We're gonna do it my way - no highway option," the commando commands, when child-stoked chaos threatens his domain. Soon, the children fall in line. With practice, they start enjoying the results of exercise routines, commitments to personal goals and shows of force against bullies. For those without children to pacify, however, two afternoon hours in the theater for this parable might feel misspent. As Mr. Diesel instructs his lollygagging charges: "You're burning daylight. Now move!" "The Pacifier" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has a scene that involves violent explosions and victims.

Even two years ago, could Vin Diesel have imagined starring in a movie that would require his macho self to dive head-first into a kiddy playpen filled with colored plastic balls and emerge triumphantly with a soiled diaper in hand? Yet such is the tenor of the humor in "The Pacifier," a truly gag-worthy comedy designed to open up new horizons for the flagging action hero by having him baby-sit a family of obnoxious brats. If auds swallow this odoriferous exercise in calculated career repositioning, they'll swallow anything. But the "Daddy Day Care" crowd may well be lying in wait.
Best when he's brooding and truculent, Diesel, who lacks the grace and timing of a natural comic actor, here attempts the sort of image shift that Arnold Schwarzenegger pulled off at a significantly more advanced stage of his screen career by self-consciously sending up his muscleman persona in mainstream comedy.
Three important differences: Diesel hasn't remotely established the sort of public profile that Schwarzenegger had when he went comic; he hasn't surrounded himself with such skilled talent; and his material is significantly more ridiculous.
It's hard to imagine mature adults in the upper echelons of the motion picture business getting excited about a script whose biggest laugh line has a little girl looking at the shirtless Diesel character and asking, "Why are your boobs so big?" But similar juvenile humor graced screenwriters Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant's "Starsky & Hutch" script last year, so everyone knew what they were getting into.
Suspicious cultural watchdogs may also detect a subliminal message about how American youth must now be militarily indoctrinated at a very early age.
Diesel plays Navy S.E.A.L. Shane Wolfe, a military lifer briefly assigned to protect the family of a scientist who Shane couldn't prevent from being assassinated. While Mom (Faith Ford) is away trying to get her hands on the literal key to her late husband's legacy, Shane confronts a five-kid household he finds woefully lacking in discipline, manners and obedience training. But even the by-the-books Shane can't prevent the little ones from barfing, pooping and farting as they please, or the household duck from attacking him the way Mike Tyson did Evander Holyfield.
Loading his ammo belt with milk bottles for the tyke and imposing 6 a.m. reveille even on Sunday, Shane is disrespected by headstrong teen Zoe (Brittany Snow) and withdrawn Seth (Max Thieriot), as well as by Helga (Carol Kane), a nanny of Transylvanian whiteness who would have seemed more at home in "The Addams Family."
As if on automatic scriptwriting pilot, however, the kids gradually come around to a grudging affection for the domineering soldier, who manages to turn Zoe from a hopeless drivers ed student into an ace getaway driver and, in the script's most jaw-droppingly peculiar turn, saves the day for aspiring actor Seth by stepping in as director of a little theater production of "The Sound of Music," a move that also positions Shane as a would-be Captain Von Trapp at home. Climactic action rates on the credibility scale with Macaulay Culkin taking on the baddies in "Home Alone."
The one genuinely comic contribution is supplied by "Everybody Loves Raymond" big man Brad Garrett. He scores strongly as a blustery high school vice principal and wrestling coach who ill-advisedly challenges Shane to a match. Lauren Graham is thoroughly wasted as the school principal and a former Navy girl who takes an innocuous shine to the strapping babysitter.
John Debney's score leans on mock military strains for most of its effect, while Bethesda looks a whole lot like Toronto here. Costco is plugged to an obnoxious degree.

"How can shit like this happen to the same guy twice?" was Bruce Willis 's lament in Die Hard 2 , which shouldered both its Xerox  plot and its body bags lightly thanks to a pervading air of jokey self-reflexivity. No such luck for the similarly repetition-compulsive Hostage , which stacks its corpses with the same baroque hysteria that Björk brought to the murder scene in Dancer in the Dark . Ex-SWAT Willis is a cocky longhair hostage negotiator in L.A. until a crisis slips from his grasp, leaving a mother and her son dead. No sooner has Willis shaved his head and moved to a PD in the sticks than three well-armed local teens attempt to steal an SUV and instead end up locked in a hyper-modern hilltop fortress with affectless accountant Kevin Pollak  and his two brats. Turns out Pollak has some nasty dealings with guys in balaclavas, who detain yet more innocents . . .
Bruce looks hot and underplays handsomely as always, but Hostage  is a steaming pile of siege clichés and screaming unlikelihoods. Much of the rescue strategy, for instance, hinges on the head captor never noticing that the younger kid is loose in the house, and the filmmakers scrabble desperately for a class subtext, pitting dirty-rich Pollak versus poor white trash, with Willis caught in the middle class. Once the craziest of the housejackersthe baleful spawn of a Crispin Glover -Trent Reznor  hatefuckgets a knife through the cheek and turns pyromaniacally love-lorn, Hostage  begins to evoke the notebook scrawlings of a trench-coat-mafia goon.
