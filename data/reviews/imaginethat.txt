When did the relatively unterrifying actor Thomas Haden Church, best known for his roles in Sideways
, Spider-Man 3
, and TV�s Wings
, morph into the completely nightmarish Tommy Wiseau, the Bizarro World, actor-writer-director hyphenate behind the disastrous cult movie The Room
? Like Spidey's nemesis, the Sandman, Church has somehow rearranged his molecular structure to mimic that of Wiseau, right down to the feral ebony mane and the creepy, mesmeric gaze. It's a feat, all right, and a surprise (disturbing though it may be), but it's nothing when compared with the even more shocking revelation that Murphy has made a family-friendly, kid-centric film without a single fart joke. True, he does put his foot in a cow patty at one point � a sly homage to his critics, perhaps? � but Imagine That
 is remarkably and refreshingly free of Murphy's usual penchant for antic toilet humor and howling bad taste. It's a downright restrained performance from the once-upon-a-time comic genius who gave us the dark humor of Trading Places
, the scathing stand-up of Raw
, and the sweet-natured romance of Coming to America
 in what now feels like an entirely different career. Murphy is Evan Danielson, a Denver-based workaholic financial analyst so wrapped up in his hyper-competitive workload that he's become an archetype of the separated bad dad to his 7-year-old daughter, Olivia (the impossibly adorable Shahidi). While his ex (Parker) bemoans his nonexistent shared-parenting skills, lonely little Olivia has conjured a band of imaginary friends to offset her lack of a caring father figure. As it happens, her invisible pals and the blue blankie she uses to enter their realm have a decided knack for finance, and pretty soon dad and daughter are bonding over magic kingdoms and stock portfolios, although Evan views this improbability more as a means to advance his career rather than his relationship with his daughter. You can probably guess, very early on, how all this is going to end up, especially if you're familiar with the Weitz brothers' infinitely more subtle film, About a Boy
. However, Imagine That
 is an innocuous, at times charming and frequently sweet, family film with engaging performances, a straightforward moral for parents everywhere, and enough genuine giggles to keep both parents and their young charges amused. The script, interestingly, is co-written by Chris Matheson, son of legendary fantasist Richard Matheson (who scripted, among other things, many of the classic, Rod Serling-era Twilight Zone
 episodes and the recently readapted zombie classic I Am Legend
). There are no zombies whatsoever to be found in Murphy's newest (although there is that Church/Wiseau weirdness), and, all in all, Imagine That
 is an amiable detour from its star's usual scatological skronk. Kids will empathize, parents will breathe a sigh of relief, and curmudgeonly, film critics everywhere will be, I imagine, much relieved at not having to thumb through their thesauri seeking yet another synonym for �gaseous.�

'Imagine That" is family-movie mediocrity (lately, it seems that unless we're talking about Pixar
 there's no other kind). A workaholic dad bonds with his creative 6-year-old daughter, who brings him to her imaginary world, which due either to lack of money or, well, imagination, the audience doesn't get to see. You can take the title any number of ways: as a command, the beginning of a sentence that trails off, what someone says when surprised by a bit of news, or how one feigns that surprise. Eddie Murphy in another mediocre family comedy?  Imagine that.
But the movie, ho-hum as it is, manages to be oddly, worryingly of interest. You want to see how much the cynicism can swallow up the wholesomeness. It's like watching a snake eat a mouse. The divorced workaholic dad, Evan (Murphy), is a high-level investment banker. The daughter, Olivia (Yara Shahidi), talks to imaginary friends. The father, who's in the middle of several major deals, can't be bothered with the little girl or her imaginary world  - until her chums start giving him sound investment advice. Suddenly, he's thrilled to run around his Denver loft, cover his head with Olivia's favorite blanket, and ask her fake friends for real recommendations about which companies to invest in.
This is like watching one of those financial commercials that play during changeovers on tennis broadcasts. The movie's actual ads even come with an apt tag line: "What if your daughter's imagination was the secret to your success?" UBS and ING
 must be kicking themselves. But a cute  advertising premise stretched to feature length kills the charm of a gag that should last no longer than 50 seconds.
Directed by Karey Kirkpatrick and written by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, authors of the first two "Bill & Ted" movies, "Imagine That" goes on for well over 90 minutes. It's clogged with earnest covers of Beatles music, and leaves you in a bind about the father-daughter relationship. Olivia has no idea what her advice means. She thinks she's just helping Daddy. And boy is she. He's this close to trumping his nearest rival, a flamboyant American Indian (Thomas Haden Church) who gives Power Point presentations with nature backgrounds and tree-stump pie charts. The white bluebloods eat up his slideshows and tribal counseling ("The best spear is the one you don't throw").
Some movies seem like they might have been written by executives at a board meeting. This one seems like it was written by executives in a golf cart. (A securities blanket? Really?) What child wants to listen to men wearing suits in drab-looking offices talk about a 4 percent reallocation away from some kind of arbitrage?
The movie was made before the economic crisis, but the idea of two adult bankers desperately relying on kids and mumbo jumbo for investment tips inadvertently explains how we got there ("I wanted to ask about magnesium futures," says Evan to an imaginary queen). But "Imagine That" is not a farce  - not on purpose. It's a cartoon. And the children at the screening I  attended seemed to enjoy it well enough. Who doesn't love a kid high on energy drink? Or a little smart alec? For the smart alec, Murphy shares a too-brief scene with Bobb'e J. Thompson, the reigning bad boy of underage blue comedy, which for Murphy must be like Dorian Gray in reverse. (Will Murphy ever curse again?)
But, really, if there's a reason to sit through any of this (and I'm not saying the reason is that compelling), it's the connection Murphy has with Shahidi, a sweet, eloquent cutup. This is the umpteenth occasion Murphy has shared the screen with either a child, a pet, or, in this case, a pet child. But here the children bring out the best  - OK, the better  - in him. The choice not to show Olivia's world is justified only by the fun he and Shahidi have pretending the place exists.
They make pancakes, which she douses in a range of non-maple condiments. Murphy teaches her how to sing a song for a school show (the movie saves its syrup for that sequence), and she parodies his guttural gospel. "Oh, my baby sound like Minnie Riperton," he exclaims. Not quite. But this little girl makes starring in such a crass excuse for an early Father's Day gift more tolerable than it has any right to be.

In Imagine That , Eddie Murphy, as a finance wizard, is supposed to be a father woefully out of touch with his inner child. But Murphy turns the role into a one-man Romper Room. He minces, he contorts his face into twitchy grimaces, he collapses into fits of mock hysteria so intense that the mock all but falls away. And that's before  he learns that his daughter (Yara Shahidi) is communing with a set of imaginary playmates  three princesses and a queen  who offer insider stock tips that never fail. (Is this sort of information legal when it's delivered by a child's made-up companions? The movie never says.) At that point, Murphy really  starts to act up.
To retrieve the tips, he must play along with his daughter by pretending to visit her friends in their fairy kingdom. This requires him to explore, for the first time, his parental imagination; it requires him to have fun with his child. Imagine That  is a benignly didactic kiddie movie that at once benefits from and gets buried under Eddie Murphy's skittery, overeager inflections. He can often be a bit much, like his idol Jerry Lewis. That said, there's something sweet about the way that Murphy throws himself into this piffle. Thomas Haden Church does too, as Murphy's rival, a corporatized Native American who talks about finance in fake-Indian gobbledygook. At times, he almost makes sense.


Arguably the most innocuous pic of Eddie Murphy's career to date, "Imagine That" is an undemandingly pleasant, mildly amusing fantasy in which nothing -- not even those elements that actually define it as a fantasy -- is ever allowed to get of hand. Arriving amid the summertime cavalcade of comedies suffused with raunchy tomfoolery, it may be greeted as a godsend by parents who want to spend an afternoon at the megaplex with their preteen daughters. It's difficult to imagine, however, that this PG-rated Paramount/Nickelodeon presentation will draw many ticketbuyers outside that narrow (albeit potentially profitable) niche.
The latest in a seemingly endless line of sentimental laffers about stressed-for-success dads who reconnect with their neglected kids, "Imagine That" finds Murphy working in a very engaging but atypically understated mode. Indeed, even on those occasions when his character, Denver-based financial manager Evan Danielson, engages in some spirited comic riffing -- silly voices, prancy dancing -- his behavior seems no more manic than the everyday horseplay of a father interacting with a young child.
Unfortunately, Evan has been too wrapped up in his job to spend much quality time with his young daughter, Olivia (Yara Shahidi). His estranged wife (Nicole Ari Parker) more or less forces their child on him for a week of bonding, but Evan finds little time in his overcrowded schedule to be a dutiful dad.
Little wonder, then, that Olivia seeks companionship with invisible playmates in an imaginary world. Evan is annoyed by Olivia's propensity for make-believe -- until the invisible playmates start to provide, through Olivia, exceptionally prescient investment advice.
Before long, Evan is a supernova at the investment firm where his soon-to-retire boss (Ronny Cox) is seeking a successor. The other candidate is Johnny Whitefeather (Thomas Haden Church), a self-styled mystic whose Zen-like affectations and faux-Native American gobbledygook barely disguise his ruthlessly competitive streak.
Making his live-action directing debut after scoring with "Over the Hedge," helmer Karey Kirkpatrick (who also helped write the recent films of "Charlotte's Web" and "The Spiderwick Chronicles") takes a surprisingly naturalistic approach to the fantastical aspects of the script by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson. Rather than rely on CGI, animatronics or other f/x trickery, he presents Olivia's invisible playmates as -- well, invisible.
In fact, Evan (and the audience) must rely on Olivia to describe the specifics of her fantasy world; all the viewer ever gets to see or hear is father and daughter conversing and capering in Evans' lavishly appointed apartment and a few outdoor locations.
For those who remain immune to the pic's low-key charms, the extended segments of "Let's Pretend" will seem between unremarkable and silly. But it's just as likely that parents and their young offspring will be enchanted by those scenes in which the only special effect is the warm chemistry generated between sly pro Murphy and charming newcomer Shahidi.
Church's transparent phony-baloney act as Whitefeather is the only thing here that approaches overstatement, but the actor is sufficiently deft to stay just this side of caricature. It's not his fault that the character itself will be viewed by some as borderline offensive, an impression not entirely dispelled when his Native American roots are revealed as extremely shallow.
The filmmakers generate so much goodwill throughout "Imagine That" that it's genuinely disappointing when they fall back on the crisis of conscience that develops when a protagonist must choose between attending an important business meeting or being in the audience when his child takes part in some activity that just happens to be scheduled at the same time.
Outstanding contributions by production designer William Arnold and lenser John Lindley go a long way toward establishing a believable workaday world where fathers and daughters can make their own magic with flights of imagination. Aptly chosen covers of Beatles songs are adroitly mixed into the soundtrack.

Eddie Murphy  is a Denver investment consultant, Evan, with a workaholic schedule that leaves little space for his seven-year-old daughter, Olivia (Yara Shahidi ). Adding to his pressures is the meteoric rise of a co-worker, shtick Native American "Whitefeather," whose financial consultations come couched in pseudo-mysticism and PowerPoint  razzle-dazzle (played by Thomas Haden Church , fitfully amusing, with characterization and makeup owing much to Phil Hartman 's SNL  Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer). Evan's interest in parent-child bonding spikes when Olivia becomes a medium for clairvoyant insights into international business trends via her imaginary friends. On the surface, the idea of combining Bloomberg Terminals, market jargon, and childish fancy seems counterintuitive. That's because it is. But Imagine That  does manage to get a crowd tearing up on cue for its emotional climax; as much as it works, it's through the personal charm of Murphy and Shahidi. Strikes against include god-awful Beatles  covers, over-reliance on the hilarity of grown-ups in suits saying "poop," and obtrusive Red Bull  product placement—the beverage company may as well start producing films itself after this and Yes Man . If memory serves, kiddies like whatever movie you drop them off at but, for the record, Drop Dead Fred  remains the vastly superior film.
