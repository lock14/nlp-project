You would think a lusciously animated indie film about the perils of prejudice and imperialism would go off like a firecracker in this season of political and cultural change, but sadly, Delgo
 is a dud. Don't blame the animators, though. A kaleidoscopic treat for the eyes, Delgo
 fairly leaps off the screen and slathers the audience with its candy-colored palette of extremely attractive visuals. It's like a Tootsie Pop in that regard, all shiny, sticky, and delicious, but once you get to its bland brown center (coming, as it does, after way too many metaphorical licks), you're likely to be disappointed by what is essentially a wad of less-than-sensational CGI treacle. As the brief, well-edited prologue informs, Delgo (voiced by Prinze Jr.) is a young, headstrong member of the Lockni race, a peaceful people in the land of Jhamora who resemble Land of the Lost
's Sleestacks but act more like that movie's Chaka on a no-hair day. Enter the Nohrin, the winged warrior race whose own land has become uninhabitable. The Nohrins' sage King Zahn (voiced by Gossett Jr.) brokers a deal with the Lockni for his people to share the Lockni's fertile Eden, but that lasts only until his evil daughter Sedessa (voiced by Bancroft) micromanages a plot to make it appear as though Delgo and his knucklehead pal Filo (voiced by Kattan, mining a heretofore untapped vein of Jar Jar Binks-speak) have attacked the Nohrin Princess Kyla (Hewitt), thus sparking a power-grab and potential interracial war. (It should go without saying to anyone over the age of 5 that Delgo and the Princess strike their own hormonal sparks.) Delgo
's chief melodramatic template appears to be Star Wars
, not in itself a bad thing, but the lifts from Lucasfilm are so brazen � Duncan's peaceful mystic character might as well be named Obi-Wannabe � that they render the whole film inert by the thoroughly telegraphed outcome. Princesses and paupers (or serfs, vassals, or whatever the Lockni may be) are alike throughout the omniverse, apparently, and while the very young may get a kick out of Delgo
's trippy color scheme, the rest of the scheming here is strictly cloned from other, infinitely more interesting wars.


"Delgo" demonstrates how hard it is to create a memorable, credible-looking piece of animated entertainment. The film looks a little like a screen saver (those landscapes!) and a little like a video game (the characters' movements are only vaguely lifelike and would be more fun if you could control them yourself), and not much at all like the smooth, richly dimensional animation that usually turns up at the movies. ("Bolt" has nothing to worry about.)
But the makers of "Delgo" - an independent outfit called Fathom Studios that specializes in advertisements and broadcast spots - do have wholesomeness and earnestness on their side. "Delgo" doesn't lean on pop references or meta-movie high jinks. It's the movie equivalent of the parent who gives a thirsty kid water when he's begging for Kool-Aid.
The film is set in one of those quasi-medieval magic lands where the predominant inhabitants resemble reptile people in the greenish "Shrek" mold and where giant coconut husks have cute suction tentacles. Everything recalls one of those Saturday morning cartoon shows that come on before "That's So Raven" and "Hannah Montana."
The story is by-the-numbers: Two factions war over land and forbidden love. A young male from one side - Delgo (Freddie Prinze Jr.) - falls in love with a winged princess (Jennifer Love Hewitt) from the other. The additional voices include Val Kilmer, Malcolm McDowell, Lou Gossett Jr., Michael Clarke Duncan, Burt Reynolds, and the late Anne Bancroft.
The movie has them all act out a piece of young adult fiction in which exactly what you'd expect ensues. There's no crime in any of this. But as the movie veers from New Age mumbo jumbo ("Connect with the stone, Delgo. Feel its pulse!") to 40 minutes of chases and airborne swordfights, it's hard to be excited. This isn't rousing entertainment. It's the sort that mongers messages. Can't we, say, just get along?

Too grim for kids and too dumb for grown-ups, this cut-rate CG space opera raises more questions than it answers. Where did the dueling species of frog-monkey warriors come from? Why does the teen hero (Freddie Prinze Jr.) have Jedi-like powers? And why is evil Sedessa (Anne Bancroft) bent on world conquest? After 90 minutes of static action and videogame-caliber graphics, most viewers will be left pondering the biggest puzzle of all: Why was Delgo  even made? D–

 In the fictional land of Jhamora, the earthbound Lockni natives have come to distrust the winged Nohrin immigrants (a shared fondness for the silent “h” notwithstanding). So when a Lockni lad named Delgo (voiced by Freddie Prinze Jr.) develops a crush on the Nohrin princess Kyla (Jennifer Love Hewitt), her resemblance to Paula Abdul and his to a mottled potato are the least of their problems.  Plundering the imaginations of Anne McCaffrey, Peter Jackson, George Lucas and Shakespeare, this barely animated fantasy suffers from more than just a lack of originality. Dreary battles and apathetic voice work — only Eric Idle, as a malaprop-prone servant, earns his fee — conspire in a sedition-oriented plot that not even six writers (including the directors, Marc F. Adler and Jason F. Maurer) are able to invigorate.  Too leaden for adults and too baffling for kids (a gambling soldier whines about “the vig”), “Delgo” has a lumbering, prehistoric vibe fueled by dinosaur-derived creatures and images of intimidating density. Louis Gossett Jr.’s dignified baritone, emanating from the Nohrin king — whose bone structure recalls the alien played by Mr. Gossett in “Enemy Mine” — is no match for Chris Kattan’s grating contribution as Delgo’s shrieking sidekick, Filo. If only the evil empress Sedessa had crushed him beneath her heel instead of that innocent Lockni baby.  “Delgo” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). A wicked aunt, an endless war and unnecessarily tight unitards.

Ten years ago, the notion of a science-fantasy rendition of Romeo and Juliet  starring Freddie Prinze Jr.  and Jennifer Love Hewitt  might have seemed like a sure-fire moneymaker, and the level of CG animation in Delgo  might also have looked state-of-the-art. Today, few are likely to pay much attention, despite a voice cast that also includes Malcolm McDowell , Michael Clarke Duncan , Val Kilmer , Anne Bancroft , Eric Idle , Burt Reynolds , Louis Gossett Jr.  . . . oh, and Kelly Ripa  and Chris Kattan , alas. Set in a land called Jhamora, Delgo  tells the tale of two races hoping to live in peace, yet set on the brink of war. One is a race of reptile-people who can move stones with their minds; the other, winged sprites who ride dragons (which seems redundant). All appear to have exactly the same face: a leftover Gelfling mask from The Dark Crystal  that simply gets re-colored ad infinitum. When fairy-like Princess Kyla (Hewitt) saves the life of saurian dork Delgo (Prinze), the two stumble onto a conspiracy by an exiled queen (Bancroft) and treacherous general (McDowell) to conquer both races. Will love save the day? You won't care—more likely, you'll just wonder why this isn't a video game you can actually play.
