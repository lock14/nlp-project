In "The Pink Panther 2," Steve Martin garbles his way through another turn as the moronic Inspector Jacques Clouseau. I would say the reprise is ill-advised, but the first outing made a lot of people a lot of money. And idiot peacekeepers are hot again. Before Paul Blart, there was Clouseau. So rather than making too much out of how terrible the second helping of Clouseau is (quite, actually), in the spirit of generosity, I'll take a moment to note that this excruciating excuse for entertainment contains a few painkillers.
Take Andy Garcia. He plays the Italian member of the "international dream team" of detectives in pursuit of a stolen diamond, and every time he delivered his character's name - something like Vicenzo Ricotta Yada Yada Brancaleone - my migraine went away. As work, his job is thankless, but he does it like a professional. It's not condescension I detect as he trudges from one set to the next, it's something approximating enjoyment.
Sadly, his pleasure isn't contagious. My head appreciated him more than my heart ever did. The same is true for everybody who shows up to work alongside or across from Martin - a tan, trim Jean Reno, Alfred Molina (using his English accent for a change), Emily Mortimer (not using hers), John Cleese, Lily Tomlin, Johnny Hallyday, Jeremy Irons. They're far from wax versions of themselves, but this is still a movie that was probably more fun to make than it is to sit through.
Martin, who's scarily ageless, appears to be having a ball. He tries on a mint-green matador costume and attempts to tango. He dangles two obnoxious French children over a balcony. He manages not to crack up while plying the pope (Eugene Lazarev) with insults. He uses that bad French accent with the grace of someone handling a bazooka. Paying customers may find his enthusiasm heartening, but Martin works so hard that all you see after a while is the work. That's true of all the actors. The same couldn't be said of the cast of the original "Pink Panthers," including Peter Sellers as Clouseau.
Even at their gassiest, those movies at least had a director in Blake Edwards. At no point in "Pink Panther 2" does credible screenwriting or apparent direction allow for the sensation of spontaneity. Everyone is free to talk over everyone else or, as Irons does, pretend they're not even there. Aishwarya Rai doesn't appear to know what film she's in. The Indian superstar - working now as Aishwarya Rai Bachchan  
 - plays a criminologist who constantly looks like she's wandered in from one of Rai's L'Oreal 
ads. Her function here is window dressing. She makes even less sense here than Beyonce, who was Zee Sexy Ladee in the first movie. But all these international names ensure the brand's global domination.
A decent commercial movie tries to build on its scenes. The scenes in "The Pink Panther 2" seem arranged by a SaladShooter. Most of them are pointless. My own personal fantasies aside, why does Reno's character move himself (and two little sons) into Clouseau's apartment? Why do the sons attack him with their karate? Why has their assault been shot and edited like a remedial sequence from "The Monkees"?
That Clouseau's idiocy vexes just about everybody should be funny. It's hard, however, to get past the movie's idiocy. Playing Clouseau's exasperated boss, Cleese rams his head into a wall minutes into the action. That's a powerful image, insofar as his headache was mine.


Taking Inspector Clouseau into his fifth decade of bumbling, Steve Martin  does respectable riffs on Peter Sellers' demented obliviousness. He artfully gibberizes words like hamburger, sniggers at his own deductive élan, and does slapstick battle with everything from wine bottles to the Pope's miter. Martin, though, is so respectful of the role that he doesn't really make it his own; he does warmed-over Sellers instead of blissed-out Martin. When a series of world artifacts disappears, Clouseau is placed in charge of a dream team of detectives (Andy Garcia, Alfred Molina, etc.), which gives him too many straight men. The Pink Panther 2  provides genial chuckles, but it's never excitingly rude.

 The not-so-funny   funniest moment in “The Pink Panther 2,” the second installment of the beloved franchise since its resurrection three years ago with Steve Martin as the vainglorious, bumbling French inspector Jacques Clouseau, takes place at the Vatican. The pope has just had a priceless ruby ring snatched off his finger by a thief who has already stolen the Magna Carta, the Japanese imperial sword and the Shroud of Turin. (Somewhere along the line the Pink Panther diamond, a symbol of France, is also pilfered once again.)  As a so-called dream team of investigators from Britain (Alfred Molina), Japan (Yuki Matsuzaki) and Italy (Andy Garcia) question the pope, Clouseau rummages through a closet stuffed with papal vestments, impulsively tries one on and rushes to the balcony overlooking St. Peter’s Square. Leaning forward to bestow a blessing, he loses his footing,  tumbles head first from the balcony and clings to a flagpole, robes flapping along with his arms and legs.  Such hoary slapstick routines, invariably rushed, are all there is in “The Pink Panther 2,” a movie whose remaining cast list — John Cleese (replacing Kevin Kline from the first installment), Lily Tomlin, Jean Reno, Emily Mortimer, the Bollywood beauty Aishwarya Rai Bachchan —  suggests something a little more refined than this hodgepodge of juvenile pranks.  Ms. Tomlin’s character, Mrs. Berenger, a spinoff of her Tasteful Lady, represents the movie’s only attempt to be a comedy of manners. A police instructor on etiquette, she tutors Clouseau, whose every third sentence is a sexist or racist slur — as when she overhears him saying to his Japanese colleague, “I suppose you will be wanting sushi, my little yellow friend” —  on politically correct speech.  It is tempting to think of the revived franchise as the sort of misbegotten renovation that can take place when an architectural landmark, say, the original Pennsylvania Station, is replaced by a banal, anonymous structure. The original “Pink Panther” movies, I should hasten to add, were hardly landmarks. Respectable comedies with a modicum of sophistication, they were anchored by the presence of  Peter Sellers, a comic genius whose every tic suggested an upheaval of subversive mischief.  As much as I admire Mr. Martin’s cooler brand of comedy, his Clouseau lacks the demonic glee Mr. Sellers put into a character who seemed to originate from the inside out. Mr. Martin’s Clouseau is a skillful gloss right down to the phony French accent, which lacks the layers of oratorical pretension Mr. Sellers put into it. Why is it, I wonder, that any number of actors can play James Bond, while Clouseau now and forever belongs to Mr. Sellers?  Although the stunts come thick and fast in “The Pink Panther 2,” they are jammed together in a way that gives most of them barely enough time to register. The director Harald Zwart, taking over from Shawn Levy, has so little trust in his routines and in the audience’s attention span that none is allowed to develop into a belly-laughing classic.  In no particular order these are some of those gags: Clouseau accidentally burns down the same restaurant twice. Posing as a flamenco dancer, he tramples on his partner’s feet. While ineptly sleuthing around in the mansion of a suspect (Jeremy Irons), he is unknowingly captured on surveillance cameras and ends up falling down a chimney. Exploring a rack of expensive wines in a snooty restaurant, he nearly tips it over, and the bottles sliding from their niches become pins in a mammoth juggling exhibition. He bungles at karate with the sons of his sidekick Ponton (Jean Reno). He goes haywire with a fire extinguisher.  Mr. Martin works hard to get the few laughs he can from such strenuous business. He seems to be having a reasonably good time. But this is the stuff of the Three Stooges. That’s all well and good if you know what not to expect.  “The Pink Panther 2” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has mild sexual innuendo.

The Pink Panther is 45 years old now, with a bigscreen life only two years shorter than James Bond's, and a lesson of both series is, don't underestimate the power of a catchy musical theme and memorable opening credits. In the case of "The Pink Panther 2," the "2" of which is used advisedly in that this is actually the 10th Inspector Clouseau feature, the enduring inspirations of the late composer Henry Mancini and animators Friz Freleng and David DePatie provide more consistent enjoyment than the miss-but-sometimes-hit merriment generated by the living participants. But like Steve Martin's first outing in the role three years ago, which generated a $158 million worldwide gross, "2" serves up enough goofy pranks and fractured wordplay to keep the series purring along.
While hardly supplanting Peter Sellers in anyone's memories, Martin proved a more than serviceable Clouseau in his first go-round in the role in 2006, mangling pronunciations with particular aplomb -- his memorable tussle with "hamburger" gets a replay here -- and performing clever variations on old Sellers-Blake Edwards routines. There's more of the same this time around: A new take on the classic finger-on-the-spinning-globe gag is funny, and Martin's back-and-forth with Andy Garcia over the pronunciation of the endless name of the latter's Italian character provokes the most sustained laughs in the picture.
Script by Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, who penned the recent Sundance hit "500 Days of Summer," and Martin follows the time-tested blueprint: Clouseau is called out of parking-violations department banishment to join a dream team of world detectives to track down the Tornado, who thus far has stolen the Magna Carta, the Shroud of Turin and the Imperial Sword of Japan.
Mix of Garcia's Italian, Alfred Molina's Brit, Yuki Matsuzaki's Japanese and Bollywood star Aishwarya Rai Bachchan's Indian creates a veritable bumper-car ride of accents, with Jean Reno, as Clouseau's partner, and Emily Mortimer, as the detective's adorably prim associate and secret love, tossing in their own French inflections for good measure.
Thwarted when Clouseau's suspicions that the Tornado is a haughty grandee (Jeremy Irons) prove false, the group is stunned when the pope, no less, is divested of his irreplaceable ring in the Vatican. Amusing silliness ensues when Clouseau dons papal vestments and becomes mistaken for the Holy Father by the crowds at St. Peter's, but the detective's impersonation of a flamenco dancer falls flat, evidence that Martin needs a director more adept at staging and timing physical comedy than the Dutch-born, Norway-based helmer Harald Zwart -- who, to paraphrase Clouseau, is a director to remember for a film that must be forgotten, "Agent Cody Banks."
Producer Robert Simonds commendably follows the guidelines Edwards set early in the "Panther" series but then dropped, surrounding Clouseau with adept, sexy co-stars. Even when not much is going on, it's agreeable enough to observe the likes of Mortimer, Irons, Garcia, Bachchan, Molina, Reno, Matsuzaki and John Cleese get up to their little mischief.
Lily Tomlin assumes the inspired new character of a political-correctness watchdog at police headquarters who keeps catching Clouseau at wayward moments. But after a promising start, it partly may be the resurgent series' slide toward juvenility and direct aim at subteen audiences that robs Tomlin's role of its potential, as Clouseau is prevented from doing or saying much that is truly outrageous to provoke the woman's schoolmarmish wrath.
Paris and assorted other Euro locations add welcome flavor, although production values are pretty basic.


There are maybe two or three laugh-out-loud moments and a handful of chuckles to be culled from Steve Martin s overlong Pink Panther 2, the latest installment in the lackluster overhaul of Blake Edwards  and Peter Sellers s iconic Pink Panther comedy franchise. Thats as good as it gets. After several of the worlds most important cultural artifacts are stolen, Inspector Clouseau  (a lifelessly mugging Martin) is drafted to head up a whos-who of the worlds leading detectives to track down the culprit. Until that storied team comes together, the film is a dreary checklist of pratfalls, wan double entendres, and frantic, unfunny set pieces. Jolts of inspiration briefly appear in the forms of a dick-waving Andy Garcia  and a verbally jousting Alfred Molina  (each playing a detective), and Lily Tomlin  as a counselor trying to turn the casually racist and sexist Clouseau into a model of political correctness. The rest of the cast (Emily Mortimer , Jeremy Irons , a disarmingly beautiful Aishwarya Rai Bachchan ) is fine, but its Garcia, Molina, and Tomlin who give you momentary hope that the film might settle into a witty, irreverent romp. Unfortunately, their efforts are ultimately defeated by Harald Zwart s inert direction of a flat script. And youll have no problem figuring out the villain long before the film ends.
