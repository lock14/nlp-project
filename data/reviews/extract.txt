Finally, one of Judge�s live-action movies is the recipient of a wide theatrical release and a full-court marketing push. The success of his animated Beavis and Butt-Head Do America
 was followed by the disappointing theatrical run of Office Space
 (which grew into a cult favorite only after its release on home video) and the virtual dumping of his bleak and underproduced comedy Idiocracy
 in 2006. Now, for Labor Day weekend, Judge is back with another workplace comedy and though this new film lacks the fiercely satirical bite of Office Space
 and Idiocracy
, Extract
 is hardly toothless. The comedy this time is on a broader scale, spread out among more characters and targeted more toward human follies than cultural institutions. Bateman plays Joel, Judge�s everyman, who is the owner of a factory that produces food flavorings of his own invention. Joel is beset by problems common to any small-business owner: lackluster employees, a lawsuit, and a pending sale of the business (which will be compromised by the lawsuit). Plus, Joel isn�t getting any sex at home from his wife Suzie (Wiig, who is terribly underused), and he can�t even drive up to his house without being bombarded with persistent chatter from his neighbor (Koechner), who drones on with no sense of how unwelcome he is (a more suburban version of Milton, Judge�s office drone in previous work). The subplots abound quickly: factory worker Step (Collins) is felled by a beautifully choreographed �mid-body accident,� which, in turn, attracts the attention of pretty grifter Cindy (Kunis), who is hired on as a temp at the extract factory, where she arouses the boss� sexual desire. In order to assuage his guilt about infidelity, he is encouraged by his best friend, bartender Dean (Affleck), to hire a gigolo (Milligan) to seduce his wife, Suzie, a plan that works far better than he might have imagined, had he not been woozy on horse tranquilizers. Topping things off, is the ambulance-chasing lawyer played by Gene Simmons of Kiss fame, who threatens Joel with an eye-for-an-eye style legal settlement that will do for Joel�s testicles what that midbody accident did for Step�s. Judge�s jokes remain sardonic, but he�s not quite up to the task of handling all his characters and their subplots. Dean virtually disappears in the film�s second half, which is unfortunate since Affleck is appealing in this atypical role. The characters are generally one-note figures, though Bateman provides a solid presence as the film�s leading man. Still, Extract
 stumbles a bit when it leaves the workplace and tries to wrench comedy out of marital strife. It is perhaps Judge�s ability to infuse his factory setting with such seeming veracity that causes Joel and Suzie�s home life to appear so underdeveloped. As with Judge's other movies, stupidity reigns in Extract
. It�s a vivid indictment of the way in which we all stumble along, yet the film never musters full-throated chagrin at our dull complacency.

Sometimes you’re willing to give a comedy the benefit of the doubt. If you laugh, that’s enough. But a good movie can connect that comedy to how we live in the world. Or it takes risks and demonstrates a real sensibility. Mike Judge usually gets most of the way there. His animated television shows  - “Beavis and Butt-Head’’ and “King of the Hill’’ are two  - found perverse comic life in Middle American monotony. Characters stagnated on the sofa in front of the television or yammered around a grill in somebody’s backyard. Those shows bespoke an America where the suburban normal absorbed the weird the way a paper towel accommodates a spill. Like the folks over at “The Simpsons,’’ Judge is a comedian who can find the poetic glories in stupidity.
You can feel him straining for both effects in “Extract,’’ a meandering, only fitfully funny live-action comedy with Jason Bateman as Joel, the owner of a flavor extract business. Joel exists in chronic frustration. His employees on the manufacturing floor are nincompoops whose incompetence manages to cost a worker named Step (Clifton Collins Jr.) one of his testicles. The company is on the verge of being sold to General Mills
, which is waiting to see if Step sues before it makes a move.
Lately Joel’s been trying to get home before 8 p.m., the exact time his wife, Suzie (Kristen Wiig), loses interest in sex with him. (She would rather watch “Dancing With the Stars.’’) There’s a possibility for relief with Cindy (Mila Kunis), a grifter with the pertness of a Maxim cover girl. She seduces her way into Joel’s company and Step’s life for his lawsuit money, her sloe eyes popping open when she reads about the accident in the paper. (The camera jerks ecstatically between jackpot phrases on the page  - “million-dollar settlement’’ and “lost a testicle.’’) Joel wants to sleep with her but doesn’t feel he can unless he knows Suzie is cheating, too. So he hires a pretty, young dunce (Dustin Milligan, in a wonderful haze) to pretend to be their pool boy and bed her. To Joel’s astonishment, it works hilariously well.
“Extract’’ is the opposite of “Office Space,’’ Judge’s now-beloved film about a life spent toiling amid cubicles. In that movie, the bosses were morons. In this one, the morons are the drones. A movie that mocks their incompetence would have to draw clear archetypes or create recognizably human characters.
Unfortunately, Judge is just whacking at piñata-size sketches.
One reason the popularity of “Office Space’’ grows with time (it was released with no fanfare in 1999) is that more people enter the workforce and discover they too work for idiots. It takes a heartless, more eagle-eyed farceur to make a movie about the idiots who work for you. Like the hero in Judge’s previous movie, a monotonous concept piece called “Idiocracy,’’ Joel is usually the smartest man in the room. But he needs a foil. For a minute, it looks as if might be Cindy, but she turns into the cupcake you were afraid she’d be.
Nevertheless, there’s classic screwball comedy lurking in this material, a cynic’s recognition that the world runs crookedly. But the movie is logy and repetitive. If we see the ubiquitous utility player David Koechner once as Joel’s pathologically talkative neighbor, we see him a dozen times. And even a little of Gene Simmons’s sleazy ambulance-chaser is too much. The scenes clump together. Rather than escalate to a head, they shuffle sideways.
Bateman, at least, reaches a boil. He’s very good when both backed into obnoxiousness and required to play it straight. The look on his face after he takes a hit off a bong as big as a light saber is priceless. He looks like he might actually choke to death. That moment is a bit in a movie choking on bits  - including a few good ones with Beth Grant as the battiest of all the worker bees, Ben Affleck as a bartender with a curly wig, and a dim J.K. Simmons with no wig at all. All we have here are bits, so many, in fact, that “Extract’’ feels more like a collection of crumbs.

The mass of men, wrote Henry David Thoreau, lead lives of quiet desperation. You could debate whether that statement is still true  or maybe more  true  in the age of cozy fat armchairs and giant-screen TVs. But it's certainly true this year in one breed of late-summer movie: the masochistic comedy of everyday jerkdom, in which we behold the flailing of losers who are really us. Extract  and Big Fan  both feature small-fry heroes who don't act so much as they get acted upon . True, neither one of these men is particularly quiet. But that hardly makes them any less desperate.
Couldn't Mike Judge, with his acid wit, have come up with a better title for a suburban-schlub comedy than  Extract ? The title refers to the company owned by Joel (Jason Bateman), who bottles ''natural'' food sweetener on a mini-factory assembly line that he's on the verge of selling to General Mills. The plan gets squashed when one of his workers (Clifton Collins Jr.) loses a testicle  in a freak industrial accident. The worker decides to sue, mostly at the prompting of Cindy (Mila Kunis), a sociopathic hottie. The weirdest thing about Extract  is that the small-business chicanery isn't even Joel's main problem. That would be his wife (Kristen Wiig), who draws her sweatpants tight with chastity-belt precision. Joel plans to relieve his sexual frustration by sleeping with Cindy, but he must first absolve his guilt by hiring a dumb gigolo (Dustin Milligan) to seduce his wife, a plan that ends up working a little too well.
I love Mike Judge's cartoons (King of the Hill , Beavis and Butt-Head ), and Idiocracy  (2006), his unfairly dumped future-shock satire, had flashes of demented brilliance. But didn't Judge realize that Extract , with its plastic setups and one-dimensional harpies, plays like Kevin Smith remaking a bad George Segal comedy from 1978? There are a handful of fun moments. Judge has Joel take one of the longest bong hits in movie history, and he casts Ben Affleck, in terrifying hair, as a pill-popping medicine chest of a bartender. (Affleck is the one actor on screen who looks like he's having fun.) But there's something didactic, overly programmed , about the middle-class misery of Extract . It's not just the characters' lives that are stifled  so is Judge's spontaneity as a filmmaker.
Big Fan , the first movie directed as well  as written by Robert Siegel (who wrote The  Wrestler ), stars Patton Oswalt as a 35-year-old Staten Island parking-garage attendant who has no life apart from his fervid devotion to the New York Giants. The movie is an unblinking look at the hidden (or perhaps not so   hidden) pathology of American sports mania, in which the power and victory of your team becomes the sole conduit for your self-worth.
Oswalt's Paul sits in his parking booth, then arrives back at the house he shares with his mother to call the Sports Dog radio phone-in show. There, he spouts the ''spontaneous'' Go Giants! Eagles suck!  rant he has already scrawled on a legal pad. Oswalt, looking like a mild, dwarfish Michael Moore, makes  Paul an unnervingly rational nut, a spokesman for the ''wholesome'' addiction our all-sports-all-the-time culture has become. After Paul spots the Giants' superstar linebacker, he tails him to a strip club and ends up getting beaten up by his idol  an event that you'd think would leave him furious. But it only heightens the cultishness of his worship; Paul, it turns out, loves the Giants more than he loves himself. Big Fan , while it holds us right up to the suspenseful simmer of its nerd–Taxi Driver  climax, doesn't go where you'd expect. That's what makes Siegel, more than Judge, a born filmmaker.


 In the world of celebrity do-goodism, Angelina Jolie is hot to trot the globe for the United Nations. George Clooney raises dollars and sense on behalf of Darfur. And Mike Judge? Well, the funnyman behind the cartoon yukfests “Beavis and Butt-Head” and “King of the Hill” and the very funny cult movie “Office Space” appears to have joined the ranks of celebrity do-gooders with his increasingly aggressive attempts to eradicate stupidity, one barbed, mean and sometimes hilarious joke at a time. With the barbarians clawing at the gate, somebody’s got to do it, right?  Mr. Judge’s most pointed attack on our perceived national calamity is his 2006 comedy, “Idiocracy,” about an average white guy who, after being put in a deep freeze, wakes up 500 years later to find that he’s the smartest person alive and that people  are dumb as slugs, including the president, a “smackdown” champion (and an African-American). Mr. Judge’s most recent attack on the same subject is “Extract,” another big-screen comedy about an affable white guy, Joel (Jason Bateman, predictably pleasant), an Everyman and factory owner. (He makes flavorings.) His natural decency is under constant assault by a miscellany of indignities, including a wife, Suzie (Kristen Wiig), who won’t sleep with him; a droning neighbor who can’t shut up (David Koechner); and a factory populated by lazy, dense workers.  Fitfully funny with a low joke-to-minute ratio, “Extract” plays like two irreconcilable and unfinished sketches, neither particularly fertile comedic terrain. The first revolves around Joel’s beef that his wife has sexually closed for business by the time he comes home from work, a weak bit that Mr. Judge tries to exploit with repeated close-ups of Suzie cinching her sweat pants. At the urging of his friend Dean (Ben Affleck, delivering a real performance), Joel hires a part-time pool cleaner and full-time moron, Brad (Dustin Milligan), to service her. The second sketch involves the attempts of a vamping con artist, Cindy (Mila Kunis), to scam Joel by cozying up to a dim factory worker, Step (Clifton Collins Jr.), who’s suffered an-on-the-job injury.  What’s most striking about “Extract,” beyond the scarcity of  jokes and absence of actual filmmaking, is its deep well of sourness, which at times borders on misanthropy. In his first live-action feature, “Office Space,” a comedy about the indignities of that modern hell we call a desk job, Mr. Judge took aim at the dehumanization of organizational life. In “Idiocracy” he expanded his sightlines to include corporations and consumer culture. The received wisdom remains that 20th Century Fox, which backed the movie, dumped “Idiocracy” into the marketplace because of its anti-corporatism: it mocks Fox News along with brand-name companies that run ads on media outlets belonging to Fox’s parent company, the News Corporation.  What was often left unsaid amid the ruckus is that the movie conceives of its own audience as cultural dopes.  “Idiocracy” expresses the kind of fear lampooned, consciously or not, in the old joke about revolting masses. (Messenger: “The masses are revolting!” King: “You’re telling me!”) It opens with a comparison between trailer-trash types, with low I.Q.’s, who freely propagate, and smarty-pants types who fret about conceiving, using every excuse to find the perfect time to have children. In the end the low I.Q.-ers overrun the intelligent, who die off, which is funny if you think that only certain kinds of people should reproduce. An equal-opportunity offender, Mr. Judge can wield satire like a sledgehammer, so it’s no surprise that he doesn’t bother with the complexities of class and representation in a bit about the dire consequences of a birth dearth.  In “Extract” Mr. Judge reserves many of his biggest digs for Joel’s workers, who are never more foolish than when they  confusedly attempt to organize. Their grievances are foolish and grounded in misinformation and greed. A bigger company is wooing Joel, and the workers want a piece of the action. Joel perseveres (this is an American comedy, not a French one, after all), winning them over with common sense. The only laborer who seems reluctant to join the fray is a hard-working Latino (Javier Gutierrez), who barely speaks a word. He doesn’t have to. Joel does the talking for him and then, with a smile, orders everyone back to work.  “Extract” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). What do you think? It’s a blankety-blank Mike Judge movie.

Substituting blue-collar blunderers for "Office Space's" white-collar workhorses, "Extract" distills meager laughs from a strange story about a cheating wife, a wily thief, a severed testicle and a hapless factory owner juggling all of the above. Mike Judge's latest bigscreen outing finds the always interesting writer-director working in a softer, less spoofy mode than usual and, a few colorful supporting characters aside, doesn't show his comedic instincts at their sharpest. But as his first live-action film granted the dignity of a proper wide release, the Sept. 4 opener could bottle modest-to-solid returns on the names of Jason Bateman and Ben Affleck.
Indeed, after the poor theatrical fortunes that befell 1999's "Office Space" (which happily rebounded as a cult fave on homevid) and 2006's underrated futuristic farce "Idiocracy," it's hard not to wish the best for "Extract." It's also hard not to wish Judge's script, having grounded its characters in a normal workaday setting -- a flavor-extract factory proudly run by Joel Reynold (Bateman) -- had chosen to use that setting as its primary comic motor, in the manner of "Office Space."
Initially, this does seem to be Judge's intent. After all, employee incompetence and complacency are to blame for the horrible (and amusingly staged) assembly-line accident that causes wannabe floor manager Step (Clifton Collins Jr.) to almost become a soprano -- and not the New Jersey kind. The setback couldn't come at a worse time for Joel, a hard-working, mild-mannered guy who's trying to sell the business, and whose own nether regions are turning blue from the chronic neglect of his chilly wife, Suzie (Kristen Wiig).
Enter the factory's newest hire, Cindy, who -- as played by "Forgetting Sarah Marshall's" Mila Kunis -- is such a smokin' hottie, especially compared with her co-workers, that she immediately triggers adulterous longings in Joel. Egged on by his best friend, bartender Dean (Affleck, long-haired and laid-back), and with the help of some strong tranquilizers, Joel enlists good-looking dimwit Brad (Dustin Milligan) to seduce Suzie, which will assuage Joel's guilt and free him to pursue Cindy -- who, it's revealed early on, has her own slippery agenda.
In zeroing in on a sexually frustrated small-business owner facing a major lawsuit, Judge means to wring humor from a familiar vein of American male discontent. To that end, he surrounds Joel with an assortment of rubes and grotesques, the most memorable of which is his nightmarish neighbor Nathan (David Koechner), a balding, bespectacled irritant who never knows when to shut up or go away. Pitting Koechner's passive-aggressive drone against Bateman's Mr. Nice Guy, these agonizingly protracted sequences are the only ones that go beyond funny into squirm-inducing.
Where "Extract" does succeed is in creating a factory environment so vivid, you can almost smell the vanilla. Well lensed by Tim Suhrstedt at a water-bottling plant in California's City of Commerce, these scenes are all the more gratifying for tackling a milieu not often seen onscreen. And while they don't get much screen time, Joel's employees -- from a heavily pierced rock-star wannabe (T.J. Miller) to a stubborn shrew who sees everyone's laziness but her own (Beth Grant) -- could inspire flashes of recognition among auds, wherever they work.
Otherwise, the pic's attempts at comic portraiture feel sketchy at best, more or less assigning each character a single, belabored trait -- Joel's supervisor (J.K. Simmons) refuses to remember his workers' names, Step's lawyer (Gene Simmons) is a showboating sleaze, etc.
And while "Office Space" and "Idiocracy" registered as howls of outrage at corporate culture and mass stupidity, respectively, "Extract" has little of their satirical energy or underlying anger. It skewers marriage, entrepreneurship and manual labor only to reaffirm them in the final stretch, and in a way that doesn't feel especially bighearted (like Judge's toon series "King of the Hill"), just soft-headed.
Bateman's likable straight-man routine proves reliably watchable, and while he and Affleck don't strike up much in the way of buddy chemistry, a shared scene of massive pot inhalation does score a direct hit. But the pic again shows Judge's difficulty writing female characters of substance (not that he's alone among male comedy scribes in that respect): Kunis is fine (in both senses) as a gold-digging seductress, but Wiig, so side-splitting in her throwaway appearances in "Knocked Up" and "Ghost Town," is given no such opportunities in an ostensibly meatier role.
Tech credits are pro, though George S. Clinton's overworked score is of the fill-in-the-laughs variety.

Here for Labor Day—a comedy about the hilarity and heartbreak of running a small business. A decade after his succès d'estime Office Space  (and a few months following the termination of his long-running animated series King of  the Hill ), Mike Judge  returns with a complementary social satire: Extract .
Where Office Space  was a comedy of employee disaffection, Extract  looks at the struggle between labor and capital from the other side of the desk. Named for flavorings produced by protagonist Joel Reynold  (Jason Bateman ) in his small factory, Extract  is sweeter than Judge's scabrous and, in most markets unreleased, Idiocracy . It's hardly less concerned with putting a frame around stupidity—opening with an apparently ditzy babe (Mila Kunis ) fleecing two music-store dudes for a pricey electric guitar—but where Idiocracy  held up a grotesque mirror to American mass culture and politics, Extract  seems to be designed to give capitalism a human face.
Bateman's everyman protag is our current ideal—the successful creator of his own small business—but his life is less so. The entrepreneur is waylaid by a droning nudnik neighbor (David Koechner ) each evening as he returns home from work, sexually frustrated by his bored wife, Suzie (SNL er Kristen Wiig ), and elaborately misadvised by his best buddy, Dean  (Ben Affleck ), a shaggy bartender who takes Xanax  for a head cold. His main concern, however, is his plant full of brainless assembly-line workers. In the movie's most choreographed set piece, Joel's employees effect a Rube Goldberg  catastrophe that robs their stupidest member of his family jewels. Cut to gorgeous scammer Cindy (Kunis), scanning the morning paper, glomming on a report on this "testicular incident," then showing up at the factory, having hatched a plan to take Joel to the cleaners.
What, Judge wonders, is at the root of a man's success? After an eye-batting job interview, the tantalized Joel wonders how to take advantage of his fetching new employee—and, at the same time, feels bad about it. Helpful Dean suggests that Joel allay his own potential adulterous guilt by first tempting Suzie, and, to that end, puts another specialist on Joel's payroll—the dimwitted teenaged gigolo, Brad, played by Dustin Milligan  with cretinous panache. Lubitsch it ain't, but the master would surely have approved of the twist in which, hired to seduce Suzie, Brad succeeds beyond his wildest dreams.
Abetted by some reliable comic face-pullers (J.K. Simmons , Beth Grant ), Extract  has its share of standard comic tropes—notably the one in which, deciding that Joel needs some pharmaceutical fine-tuning, Dean takes Joel to suck on a monster bong administered by a mega-dominating dope dealer. More frightening is the scene in which Joel is bedeviled by a demon-dog shyster (Gene "Kiss" Simmons, horrifyingly resplendent in a Paganini fright wig). Joel manages to hit bottom, losing his company and his wife, moving into a Best Western , before . . . well, it's a comedy. If one is inclined to analyze these things, the hero's fortune is largely a function of his luck, and Joel more or less functions as a straight man in a world of fools.
Idiocracy  was notable for satirizing even as it reveled in the dumbing of America. (Once seen, it provides an invaluable way to characterize the nation's nightly cavalcade of cable news.) Judge must have taken the lesson of Idiocracy  to heart, because, as Hollywood  comedies go, Extract  is amazingly free of gross-out vulgarity. If anything, it's overly polite and anything but anarchic. Establishing a rhythm of workaday repetition set to a country-western backbeat, the movie is characterized by its crisp, cutting, classical framing, and comic timing. The style and approach recall classic Albert Brooks . Indeed, the beleaguered, cuckolded Joel would have been a great role for the young Brooks—adding a certain self-aggrandizing je ne sais quoi  or a neurotic zetz  that the appealing, but bland, Bateman lacks.
