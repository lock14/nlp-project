         A serial lover meditates on longing and the passing of time in Wong Kar-Wai's '2046.' "All memories are traces of tears," says Chow Mo Wan (Tony Leung) at the beginning of "2046," Wong Kar-Wai's long-awaited follow-up to "In the Mood for Love," and a gorgeous, fevered dream of a movie that blends recollection, imagination and temporal dislocation to create an emotional portrait of chaos in the aftermath of heartbreak.
 
  In 1966 Chow returns to Hong Kong after having spent several years in Singapore, where he went to escape the memory of his affair with Su Li Zhen (Maggie Cheung). No longer the melancholic newspaperman, spurned husband and thwarted would-be lover, he has transformed into a slick man-about-town who writes seedy erotic stories and engages in throwaway affairs with courtesans and nightclub performers.
 


         






    In a nightclub he runs into Lulu (Carina Lau), a performer he knew in Singapore, and takes her back to her hotel. Her room number, 2046, sparks the memory of the room he shared with Su Li Zhen four years earlier, and its totemic power draws him to rent the one next door.
 
  There he meets the hotelier's daughter, Wang Jing Wen (Faye Wong), an emotionally unstable writer in love with a Japanese man her father forces her to give up. Sympathizing with Wang, Chow begins to conflate her story with his. And when he and Wang take to writing together, he begins to work on a story that will — as he tells her — let her know what her boyfriend is thinking. The story takes place in a Dickian future in which "2046" is a mysterious place where people travel to re-inhabit their memories, where nothing ever changes. The story is about the only man who ever returns, and it's titled "2047." "I made up the whole thing," Chow lies. He later concedes, "But some of my experiences found their way in."
 
  Scenes from a high-tech future world blend with scenes from the past and present, as Chow enters an affair with his new neighbor, Bai Ling (Ziyi Zhang). Haunted by the memory of the original Su Li Zhen, as well as by her namesake (Gong Li), a mysterious gambler he fell in love with in Singapore, Chow resists becoming involved with Bai, paying her for sex, and later, allowing her to pay him. With his pencil mustache and his easy smile, Leung glides over his deep well of dark feelings, like a skater on thin ice.
 
  "2046," like the sequentially numbered story within it, is a lyrical, Proustian meditation on loss, regret, love and time — the marching on of time being the cruelly inexorable constant in both. "Love is all a matter of timing," Chow writes later, as his loves blend together in a music of free-associative rumination. "It's no good meeting the right person too soon or too late."
 
  Wong brilliantly blends musical styles and eras to create an intoxicating mood. Building on the theme created by Shigeru Umebayashi for "In the Mood for Love," the soundtrack mixes bel canto, 20th century Latin nightclub standards and lonely instrumental solos to create a feeling of nostalgia for eras gone by. The cinematography by Christopher Doyle, Kwan Pun Leung and Lai Yiu Fai is as lush as it is oblique, peering through doorways and screens, slowing to a stop at heartbreaking moments.
 
  Designed and edited by William Chang Suk Ping, "2046" evokes a lost time in a place — Hong Kong — already redolent of dislocation and evanescence. The title also refers to the closing of 50 years of autonomy promised to Hong Kong after its hand-over to China in 1997. "Nothing lasts forever," Chow says casually at the beginning of the movie, which then goes on to make a solid and haunting case for the permanence of his memory and longing, which clearly will.

Just as memories of lost loves defy logic, so Wong Kar-Wai's alluring 2046  resists order: As a movie with a beginning, middle, and end, Wong's askew sequel to his voluptuously sad 2001 romance In the Mood for Love  is a head cracker, but as a cinematic bath for the senses, it's a rush, a swoon. Nobody does repressed, yearning misfits in exquisitely tailored costumes better than this Hong Kong director, who loves the look of beautiful people making hopeless romantic choices. And no other connoisseur of musical accompaniment (Wong always knows the right tune for the right variation on a theme of emotional distance) would choose to mark the passing of years in a run-down Hong Kong hotel, circa the 1960s, with a sexy mix of Dean Martin, bel canto opera, and Latin nightclub riffs.
The title of his immersive, imperfect reverie refers both to a year in the sci-fi future as well as to a room number in a seedy flophouse where Chow Mo Wan (the essential Tony Leung) wastes his talent and buries his feelings: The aspiring writer and faithful husband attracted to Maggie Cheung's married woman in In the Mood for Love  has become a hardened gossip columnist and pulp fiction scribbler whose heart is no longer available for the plucking. And so Chow, now a callous roué and literary hack, recalls his stingy relationships with a series of unsatisfied beauties. And I mean beauties: Ziyi Zhang, Gong Li, Faye Wong, and Cheung herself appear in turn, each glowing like moonlight for her director, each a vision of wounded femininity in a luscious wardrobe. Indeed, Christopher Doyle's sumptuous cinematography emphasizes tactile sensuality with such passion that we can practically feel the silk and satin.
Chow imagines the year 2046 as a concrete science-fiction destination  a haven to which anyone can travel for the recovery of one's lost memories. As the address of a tatty room in a Hong Kong that no longer exists, on the other hand, it's a site of stasis, loss, trembling sadness. There are many places a visitor may go astray in 2046  places where the filmmaker appears to be a bit at loose ends too. Still, Wong's invitation  ''Let's get lost''  is irresistible.

 IN "2046," a story of longing and loss, the passage of time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life. The man in question, a newspaper hack, lives in a glorious ruin called the Oriental Hotel, where the thin walls shake violently from the sexual exertions of the clientele. A ladies' man given to vigorous wall-shaking, the writer turns a blind eye to the hotel's decrepitude even as he keeps its female guests fixed in his sights. In this ecstatically beautiful film, walls never tumble, only women do.  "2046" is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-anticipated follow-up to his 2000 art-house favorite, "In the Mood for Love." Like the earlier film, "2046" first played at the Cannes Film Festival (in 2004), where it provoked a modest scandal. Mr. Wong, who famously works to his own rhythms, either very fast or very slow, arrived at Cannes late enough that the initial screenings had to be rescheduled. The version shown at Cannes was clearly unfinished and, perhaps as a consequence, "2046" was wanly received, even by some Wong admirers. More than a year later, the special effects are in place, as are crucial images that reinforce both the film's themes and its structure. The result is an unqualified triumph.  Set mostly over three years, starting in 1966, "2046" centers on Chow, a roué with brilliantined hair and the mustache of a lounge lizard, played by Mr. Wong's favorite leading man, Tony Leung Chiu-wai. Chow supports himself by writing sexually titillating fiction, though only on extreme occasion does he put pen to paper to interrupt his usual nightclub trolling. One day, he meets an old flame, Lulu (Carina Lau Ka-ling),  who is now known as Mimi and lives in the Oriental Hotel, in Room 2046. When Chow later returns to her hotel, he discovers that Lulu-Mimi has disappeared. He subsequently moves into the adjacent room, 2047, whereupon he meets the two women whose stories will cast shadows over his own.  Mr. Wong's films are often described as romantic, doubtless because they invariably involve sad-eyed lovers under the spell of impossible desires. Born in Shanghai, Mr. Wong moved to Hong Kong with his family when he was 5, and that may help explain why he rhapsodizes about loss with such tenderness. Even so, this early displacement doesn't elucidate why he is less interested in love than in its wreckage, in the sighs, tears and agonies that sometimes follow in love's wake. One of the first images in "2046" is of the epigram "all memories are traces of tears," a bit of throw-pillow sentimentalism that might sound ominously maudlin if the tears in Mr. Wong's films didn't corrode like acid.  Soon after Chow moves into the hotel, he meets the owner's oldest daughter, Jing  (Faye Wong), while she's practicing dance steps and Japanese in the temporarily vacant room next door. Jing, whose love for a Japanese man (Takuya Kimura)  is driving her belligerent father to distraction, hovers in the background during the first part of the film, much of which involves an affair between Chow and the latest occupant of Room 2046. Chow, who intermittently narrates the film, first sees his new neighbor, a call girl named Bai Ling (Ziyi Zhang), through a grille. The time is September 1967, and months of civil unrest in Hong Kong have just ended.  The affair between Chow and Bai Ling consumes only part of the story (a science-fiction allegory that Chow writes constitutes another), but Ms. Zhang's shockingly intense performance burns a hole in the film that gives everything, including all the other relationships, a sense of terrific urgency. The riots that rock Hong Kong, glimpsed in battered newsreel images and mentioned in passing, have nothing on the emotions that turn this woman's face into a landscape of pain. Much of "2046" unfolds in rented rooms and cramped hallways, where the characters navigate around one another, the camera trained on their faces as if searching for clues. The outside world, by contrast, remains as fragmented as an unsolved jigsaw puzzle: a street lamp in the rain, a stretch of decayed wall, a nightclub coat room.  Although the men and women in "2046" move through tight, claustrophobic interiors that are perfect representations of their boxed-in interior states, the spaces they inhabit all but shudder with luridly bright colors and dizzying geometric patterns that suggest an underlying tumult. In one scene, Chow stands almost motionless next to the swirling patterned wallpaper of the hotel's hallways as he listens outside a locked room to the hotel owner berate his older daughter for her affair. Like the opera that the father plays at a thunderous volume to hide the noise of the family's fights, and like the shimmering, jeweled cheongsams worn by Bai Ling, the wallpaper swirls express what the characters themselves cannot: their repressed desires, their playfulness and drama.  Routinely criticized for his weak narratives, Mr. Wong is one of the few filmmakers working in commercial cinema who refuse to be enslaved by traditional storytelling. He isn't the first and certainly not the only one to pry cinema from the grip of classical narrative, to take a pickax to the usual three-act architecture (or at least shake the foundation), while also dispatching with the art-deadening requirements (redemption, closure, ad nauseam) that have turned much of Big Hollywood into a creative dead zone. Like some avant-garde filmmakers and like his contemporary, Hou Hsiao-hsien of Taiwan, among precious few others these days, Mr. Wong makes movies, still a young art, that create meaning through visual images, not just words.  And so in "2046," the wallpaper swirls find a visual echo in the curls of a metal grille that, in turn, echo the loops of some cursive handwriting, the curlicue of smoke that rises from Jing's lighted cigarette and the impossibly long curve of Bai Ling's arched back. Mr. Wong fills the frame with these sensuous circles and coils like an obsessive doodler. These compulsive repetitions reach an apotheosis in the film's most mysterious image: a large cavity that looks at once like the amplifying horn of a Victrola and a sexual orifice of unknown provenance. Mr. Wong never explains the significance of the cavity because, like Kim Novak's blond twist of hair in Hitchcock's "Vertigo," the image has a power that renders further explanation superfluous.  Like Hitchcock, Mr. Wong is at once a voyeur and fetishist par excellence. No slouch when it comes to men, he lights Mr. Leung and Mr. Kimura as if they were MGM stars from the 1930's. His actresses, meanwhile, who also include Gong Li and Maggie Cheung Man-yuk, dazzle like Olympian goddesses. From the way he photographs the women in this film and elsewhere, the director appears particularly fond of how the opposite sex looks from the back. One of his signature images is of a woman in a figure-hugging dress and requisite high heels bending forward ever so slightly and away from the camera. In one of the most plaintively lovely moments in "2046," Ms. Wong leans forward to whisper a secret while wearing a silvery dress, a posture that gives her the aspect of an enormous gleaming teardrop.  "2046" is awash in such wrenching and charming tears. If everyone in this film weeps, including Chow's counterpart - a character in his hallucinatory science-fiction story that works as a parallel to his own story - it's because everyone is also captive to memory. In "2046," memory isn't just a favorite snapshot, a blast from the past. It is where everyone lives, whether they want to or not, whether giggling in a tawdry Hong Kong hotel in 1967, hurtling through the atmosphere on a train in the future or sitting in a darkened movie theater. Like film itself, memory freezes time. Memory turns finite moments into spaces - a hotel room, say - that we return to again and again. It gives us a glimpse of the eternal and, like art at its most sublime, like this film, a means for transcendence.  "2046" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). The film has some discreet sexual scenes but nothing explicit.

As Vincent Gallo would no doubt attest with "The Brown Bunny," second thoughts after rushing to meet a Cannes deadline can yield immensely positive results. However, for Wong Kar-wai's "2046" -- already in production for four years prior to its last-minute preem at Cannes on May 20 -- a further four months of editorial cogitating has produced less markedly different results. Four minutes longer 
than the Cannes version
, with some extra material and a reworked music track, "2046" redux is only a slightly different movie -- and with most of the same strengths and weaknesses.
Crucially, the superbly played half-hour section describing the affair between writer-gigolo Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) and Mainland goodtime gal Bai Ling (Zhang Ziyi) remains intact, with this relationship still forming the emotional core of the movie and returning for a powerful punch near the end. Though only fifth-billed, young thesp Zhang is still the femme standout amid a star-laden cast.
Main structural change is the reordering of some of the material centered on Chow's relationship with the hotel owner's elder daughter, played by Faye Wong, in an apparent attempt to make her character the main female role. (For example, a scene of Faye Wong making love, observed by a peeping Tom, now comes much earlier in the pic, prior to Bai Ling's appearance.)
Though Faye Wong's scenes are now spread more evenly throughout the movie, including those featuring her as a fembot on the 2046 train, the overall effect simply underlines the central weakness of the pic: that the neo-kitschy futuristic scenes don't add much to the real-life '60s relationships, which already contain everything helmer Wong wants to say about memory and regret, and the impossibility of returning in time for a second chance.
Overall, this final "2046" has a more ordered, less quirkily structured feel that isn't necessarily an improvement on the Cannes version
. Rescued material is relatively brief, with a couple more shots of Maggie Cheung (in a car with Tony Leung in B&W, smoking a cigarette in color), and ditto of Carina Lau as a futuristic fembot, to no great extra gain.
On the tech side, helmer Wong has reworked some of the music, reducing the use of Nat "King" Cole's "The Christmas Song" to twice rather than an over-repetitive five times, and the CGI-rendered city of the future is now properly colored rather than simply B&W outlines. Color throughout is far less saturated than the Cannes print
 (with a luminous, refracted-light quality to some of Faye Wong's scenes) and is actually emotionally less resonant, though reportedly closer to helmer Wong's intentions.
New end credits reflect the final version, with at least one now removed -- that of martial arts co-ordinator Tung Wai, whose sequences remain on the cutting-room floor along with much other footage. Version seen by a couple of thousand people at Cannes has reportedly been dismantled. This final version had its official world premiere in Shanghai Sept. 20, with general release in China and Hong Kong on Sept. 28.

Coming at us along the suspenseful trajectory of a meteor we've helplessly watched approach for five years now, Wong Kar-wai 's 2046  is what you should've expected in your loneliest fanboy wet dreams: a sweaty, teeming, hot-to-the-touch life-swarm of a movie. From the portentous credits and first orchestral surge, the film knows it's a post-millennial big bang, and thunderously demands your intimate surrender even as it refuses to let you get close. Wong has never sought to be graded for coloring inside the lines, and the movie's present, "final" state is a living, not-finished-only-abandoned product of notorious production delays, reshoots, reconstructions, recastings, rewrites, firings, shutdowns (including for the 2003 SARS breakout), re-edits, and festival boondoggles. Reportedly, Wong began only with the numberthe hotel room in In the Mood for Love and an idea about a Thai hit man, or a Dickian futureworld of isolating technology. And the nagging ghost of heartbreak. If the contextual slippages are unavoidable, they've got nothing on the film itself, which careens, broods, glides, and tear-blooms around inside an untrustworthy and self-pitying memory, itself coming to resemble a movie vision that would not be tamed into completeness. One reason Wong's film is so profoundly fascinating is that it feels as if it's still evolving.
Can we get away with calling it poetic abstraction? 2046  retains fragments of virtually everything its creator had ever thought it might be, making it less a "project" than an organic coalescence of the artist as a not-so-young melancholic. In fact, in many ways it forms a Wong codexhis other films haunt the movie's fringes and anterooms. Predominantly, In the Mood for Love  serves as 2046 's agonizing preludeafter that, Tony Leung 's Mr. Chow  lives out the remainder of the 1960s in an embittered state of romantic confusion, bouncing between cities and unfathomable women. He revisits the eponymous digs years later, and decides to board in the flat next door; still, the ubiquitous numeral also refers to the edge-moment when Deng Xiaoping  said that Hong Kong would go "unchanged" after the 1997 Chinese takeover, a year represented in the film by Chow's sci-fi stories of unattainable androids and wastrel romantics riding atomic tube-trains to nowhere. In Wong's bruised narrative weft, 2046  is also a mysterious emotional destination, a frontier no one returns from, a rumor of a myth of love.
As with Wong's contribution to the portmanteau film Eros  (one of several detours taken during the making of this career- summarizing behemoth), humankind lives with, desires for, and listens to itself through thin urban walls, mottled-glass windows, and implacable doors. Newspaperman Chow skitters his narrated taleas he writes it?around, from Christmas to Christmas, 1966 to 1969, from Gong Li 's darkly vulnerable casino gambler to Ziyi Zhang 's tempestuous low-rent courtesan to Faye Wong 's emotionally unstable hotelier's daughter, and back again, often in flashbacks and often in new encounters raw enough to rip the scabs right off. In Chow's world, all women seem to have multiple identities, or stand as doubled-up avatars of his own lovelorn ideas, much of it sifting down to the earlier film's intangible poignancy, and the new film's spare and diffuse glimpses of Maggie Cheung , appearing and vanishing suddenly like a sense memory catching on as you pass and sending you lost into your own labyrinths.
2046  is all texture, a conquest of formal content over content-oppressed form, where the camera is in a perpetual state of inquiry, reframing the environment and its characters as a sort of methodological humility, and where visual and aural pathways boomerang down hallways, around corners, over rooftops. Mood is everything, trumped up by a score so rich with pop songs, bossa nova drama, and symphonic mournfulness it's almost a movie on its own. 2046  may be a Chinese box of style geysers and earnest meta-irony, but that should not suggest there aren't bleeding humans at the center of it: Gong, Zhang , and Wong (with her plate-sized eyes wandering astray) all deliver masterfully detailed portraits of women ensnared in romantic impossibility. Watch Zhang's obstinate call girl barely register the debasement of being paid by the man she loves, and then jump painfully beyond it, and you'll see a level of craft not trusted in this country. Leung, having endured the ordeal of the filmmaker's titanic and fickle modus operandi, has well earned his iconic stature as a Bogartian everyman made world-weary by fate and his own selfishness. Still, one of my favorite characters is unseen, invoked only in a line of narration, a violent boyfriend described as being "like a bird that could never land."
But 2046  bleeds mostly for itself; it's a pulsing sign system of repeated melodramatic totems, ravishingly pregnant moments, and the sadness that comes from history and time's arrow. But the trip is invigorating, bursting with the insistent vitality of first-time lovemaking. At first blush, the movie seems like one of those culminating über-works after which careers often fade to blackhas Wong made the definitive Wongian film? Yes, but let's stay, unlike Mr. Chow, in the present, where 2046  is just beginning to reveal itself.
