When Charlie Bucket (Highmore) wins one of five golden tickets and thereby an invitation to visit the chocolate factory of reclusive candy-man Willy Wonka (Depp), he takes along Grandpa Joe (Kelly) and embarks on a delightfully perverse jaunt through not only the factory but also the bizarre mind of Wonka himself. This is news to no one, as are the other four invitees: porcine Augustus Gloop (Wiegratz), tiny seether Veruca Salt (Winter), over-competitive Violet Beauregarde (Robb), and video-game addict Mike Teavee (Fry) � all of whom arrive with parentage in tow. I sat through Tim Burton�s generally splendid, artful, and often sinister screen version of Roald Dahl�s classic children�s book with an enormous grin on my face for much of the time. Nevertheless, I was burdened with the nagging feeling a visit to my dentist was long overdue, and also, more alarmingly, that Johnny Depp was simultaneously channeling Kids in the Hall
-era Dave Foley, latter-day Michael Jackson, and perpetual KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer to create his own surreal vision of Dahl�s lunatic confectioner. As Burton�s surest cinematic confederate, Depp is unimpeachable, the actorly yin to Burton�s directorial yang, and here he submerges himself in the role as at least as deeply as he did for his most genuine and affecting turn in a Burton film, that of Ed Wood
. And yet, his version of Wonka, who appears to dislike children as much as he loves chocolate � a nod to Dahl�s deliciously creepy book � hasn�t to my mind displaced Gene Wilder�s antic portrayal from the 1971 version. To be sure, this Wonka is truer to the source material. Screenwriter John August, although he snatches a handful of third-act liberties, bathes the plot in a welter of verbal and physical gags that serve to machinate the kid-friendly unease into sticky new realms of chewy, gooey alarm. But Depp�s Wonka, despite the revelations of a traumatic youth spent behind an orthodontic wire-frame muzzle that�d give Hannibal Lecter the screaming meemies � or perhaps because of them � seems less mysterious than he ought to be. Not completely knowing if Wonka is friend or foe was (and remains, in Dahl�s book) one of the more adult themes to remain part of the candymaker�s mythology, so much so that even shock-maven Marilyn Manson incorporated it into his first album. Compared with the rest of the film, which dazzles outright with its gob-stopping production design from Alex McDowell and Deep Roy�s unsmiling Oompa Loompas, Depp seems oddly unmoored, even ephemeral; cotton candy to Wilder�s crunchy dark chocolate. Depp�s performance aside, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
 is pure magic, swimming as it is in a black-treacle riptide of astonishing Oompa Loompa production numbers, an eerie patina of CGI airbrushing (Wonka himself looks downright pasteurized), and some almost too clever in-jokes, and at least two references to Kurt Neumann�s 1958 film The Fly
. Unlike the 1971 version, Burton and longtime scorer Danny Elfman use Dahl�s own lyrics for the Oompa Loompa showstoppers, which means the songs are thankfully briefer and less annoying. Other wonders include the great Christopher Lee, who appears as Wonka Sr., the screen�s second most distressing dentist (after Laurence Olivier�s Christian Szell in Marathon Man
), and Phillipe Rousselot�s pristine cinematography, which wraps the whole production up in a manic, stylized glow. Devoured together it�s enough to give you a joyous stomachache � or possibly a brain-freeze � of epic proportions.


There is good weird and there is bad weird, and despite whatever glow of unearned nostalgia has gathered about it over the years, the 1971 ''Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is mostly bad weird. Directed by journeyman director Mel Stuart, it has the feel of a pilot episode for a child's first acid trip, up to and including the shock-cuts of worms and rotting food. Only Gene Wilder's fey Willy Wonka and Peter Ostrum as a choirboy Charlie Bucket save it; the rest is ''H.R. Pufnstuf" gone tediously wrong.
Roald Dahl, by contrast, wrote books that are very nearly the working definition of good weird -- fanciful, rebellious, tinged with the un-
happiness kids know is always out there, no matter how much the grown-ups simper. What director Tim Burton, screenwriter John August, and star Johnny Depp have fashioned out of ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Dahl's most celebrated novel, is pretty good weird, too -- five minutes into the film, my 8-year-old grinned and said ''This is odd
" -- but weird it is, and not just because Depp does his level best to convince us he's Michael Jackson.
Seriously. His Willy Wonka has ashen pancake make-up and an unsettling lack of wrinkles (except for one nervous little crease that goes tick-tick-tick under his right eye); under a top hat encircled by a lavender ribbon, he wears his hair in a pageboy of the sort Bette Davis favored in her later years. His voice is a sing-song pitched somewhere between Mr. Rogers and Carol Channing. In many ways, he's a bigger baby than anyone else in the movie.
In the trailers, this looked like a recipe for disaster. In the film itself, Depp's performance works surprisingly well, because there's an idea behind it and a good one. Willy is the sort of celebrity our culture coins all too easily these days; the youthful superstar whose drive sends him to the top and whose early fame isolates him into increasing eccentricity. (He has father issues to boot: In flashbacks, we learn that Wonka Sr., played by Christopher Lee, was a domineering dentist with no patience for sweets or the cavities they produce.) Depp creates something close to Howard Hughes as a self-made chocolatier, Brian Wilson with a factory instead of a sandbox -- and, yes, the King of Pop in a spun-sugar Neverland.
All of which sounds like Burton and company have ventured far beyond the confines of the book. I'm happy to report, then, that ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is much more faithful to its source than the 1971 film, and for the better. August's script often transposes Dahl's dialogue word for word from page to screen, where it shimmers wryly. And while Wonka's new psychological demons would drag the proceedings down in the hands of other filmmakers, Burton keeps things inventively and garishly delightful for the most part. The movie's overlong and there are lumps in the batter, but this is a ''Charlie" that the author would recognize as upholding his playfully dyspeptic tradition.


         When it comes to confections, Tim Burton has confessed, his preference is "dark, bitter chocolate." Which is not exactly a surprise. The director's visionary, phantasmagorical version of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is equally dark and, if not exactly bitter, unapologetically, relentlessly strange. Burton's gifts ensure you won't be able to take your eyes off the screen, but that doesn't necessarily mean you'll be happy with what you're seeing.
 
  Though it is much closer to the plot of Roald Dahl's celebrated book than the 1971 Gene Wilder-starring "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, "Charlie" paradoxically comes off as more Burton than Dahl. It's got, in an odd way, the feeling of the filmmaker's spiritual autobiography rather than the sensibility of the original story.
 


         






    In theory, this Burton-Dahl teaming, with the added bonus of Burton's gifted soul mate Johnny Depp in the Wilder role, sounded as unassailable as Laurel and Hardy. The director, whose résumé includes "Ed Wood" and "Edward Scissorhands" and whose creepy PG-13 "Batman Returns" left parents pleading for mercy, seemed the ideal match for a writer whom one critic described as having "a taste for cruelty, rudeness to adults and the comic grotesque."
 
  Although Dahl is all that and more, the reason his irresistible 1964 novel has sold 13 million copies in 32 languages is that, grotesqueries aside, its overall tone is completely genial, even affable. This ability to mix opposites, to be welcoming as well as weird, is Dahl's gift as a writer, an ability that is simply outside Burton's sensibility.
 
  "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," interestingly enough, appears to know this. Great pains are taken with elements of the film's casting, and very particular changes are made to the book's plot by screenwriter John August. It's all done with an eye to warming up what is otherwise a distant piece of work, as chilly and reserved as the novel's story of five fortunate children who get to hang out with "the greatest inventor of chocolates that there has ever been" is cheerfully accessible.
 
  All this is really a shame because Burton, working with production designer Alex McDowell and cinematographer Philippe Rousselot, displays a breathtaking visual imagination. Each image in the film — including references to "2001," "Psycho" and the choreography of Busby Berkeley — is presented with remarkable precision, polished and buffed to the highest of sheens.
 
  But from its opening images, which include chocolate-making machinery that brings instruments of torture to mind and factory chimneys more sinister than even Dickens imagined, "Charlie" can't help but go to the dark side. With the great horror actor Christopher Lee (whose autobiography is titled "Tall, Dark and Gruesome") in a key supporting role, this is a film that can make even chocolate seem inescapably evil.
 
  Which is why its such a good thing that young Freddie Highmore, Depp's winning costar in "Finding Neverland," is cast as young Charlie Bucket, "the luckiest boy in the entire world." Highmore is the most winning young actor imaginable, and his ability to dominate the early parts of the film makes us miss him all the more when his role lessens.
 
  Though Charlie is poor as the dickens, he is lucky because he lives with both his parents (Helena Bonham Carter and Noah Taylor) and all four of his grandparents, including grizzled Grandpa Joe ("Waking Ned Devine's" David Kelly), who worked for Willy Wonka once upon a time. That was before rampant industrial sabotage caused the man to close his plant and then reopen it at full capacity without employing a single human soul.
 
  Suddenly, in a news flash that literally startles the world (it's that kind of a story), Willy Wonka announces the contest to end all contests: The five lucky young people who find a golden ticket inside their Wonka chocolate bars will get to tour that super-secret factory and be eligible to win "the most something something of any something that's ever been."
 
  Naturally, Charlie finds one of the tickets (there wouldn't be much of a film if he didn't), as do four other children, each of whom represents a type of adolescent evil that Dahl, who had five children of his own, wanted to discourage in the most serious way. They are compulsive consumer Augustus Gloop, whose hobby is eating; snotty rich kid Veruca Salt, as spoiled as the day is long; competitive Violet Beauregarde, who considers herself the No. 1 gum chewer in the world; and video fiend Mike Teavee, whose original passion for television has turned into one for video games.
 
  Once these kids gather at the factory, Charlie perforce fades into the background and the film becomes the property of Depp's Willy Wonka, a creature of hollow and unnatural glee who is odd even by the standards of previous Depp-Burton collaborations.
 
  A fussy grotesque who makes Wilder's eccentric candy maker look as cozy as Mister Rogers, Depp's Willy gives off vibes as varied as Carol Channing and Michael Jackson. This former (as we learn) weird kid who grew up into a weird genius plays like Burton's version of himself, someone so peculiar he exists outside the movie in his own particular corner of space and time.
 
  Depp's bizarre nature makes the wonders of the factory (including more than 200,000 gallons of chocolate-style liquid), not to mention the punishments meted out to those evil children, seem especially sinister. That tone even infects the 100-plus miniature Oompa-Loompas (all played by Deep Roy) who run the factory and sing and dance to Dahl's original lyrics put to Danny Elfman music. Anyone looking for a reprise of "Candy Man" has come to the wrong movie.
 
  As mentioned, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" works overtime to attempt to balance its darker nature by changing the book. Charlie offers to sell the lucky ticket to help pay for food for the family, and, at the film's climax, he places family values front and center in a way that feels especially forced. Roald Dahl never resorted to stratagems like that. But then again, he didn't need to.

As Willy Wonka in Tim Burton's film of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , Johnny Depp wears his hair in a bob that looks like he might have stolen it from Julie Christie in 1966, and he has milky translucent skin that gives him the appearance of a corpse made entirely of Muenster cheese. When he smiles, flashing teeth that are white and pearly enough to terrify Tony Robbins, it's less an invitation than a threat, as if his entire mouth were filled with fangs. Wearing a top hat and red velvet coat, speaking in a light effeminate voice of extreme fussiness, he looks and acts like a 19th-century vampire who is halfway through a sex change.
Wonka, the legendary candy maker, may be a stone freak, but he is also one of Burton's classic crackpot conjurers, like Beetlejuice or Ed Wood. Depp gives a performance that's an acrid, mocking put-on, delivering meta-sarcasms as if they were vicious tidbits meant only for his private amusement. At first, I thought he was doing his version of a manic Jim Carrey clown, surfing the channels of his own brain, but Depp, in his stylized way, never breaks character, never goes for the easy self-referential multimedia gag. He maintains the paradox, the mystery, of Willy Wonka: a misanthrope who has little patience for children, who can't even utter the word ''parents'' without gagging, yet who invents for those same kids the purest and most luscious candies out of the sugar dream of his imagination.
It's become an uncomfortable experience in movies to watch Burton, the prankish mod-goth fantasist, working to twist himself into ''mainstream'' shapes. His last two films, Big Fish  and Planet of the Apes , lurched in and out of formula, but Charlie and the Chocolate Factory , which has been faithfully adapted from Roald Dahl's great 1964 children's novel, is a delectably sustained flight of fancy. It's filled with puckish, deranged Burton touches, like the all-singing, all-melting puppets that herald Wonka's arrival, but it's also a grand and transporting celebration of the primal pleasures of childhood  namely, family and candy. As Wonka gives five children, who have all found his Golden Tickets, a tour of his famous factory, with its edible garden and chocolate waterfall, its kooky sci-fi chambers for testing out revolutionary new delights, he makes no secret of the fact that with the possible exception of Charlie (Freddie Highmore), a modest English lad as gracious as he is poor, he despises them all. He has good reason: The other children are brats, pigs, rich little bullies of entitlement. Burton gives us acidly funny new versions of the spoiled-rotten monsters you may remember from the 1971 Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory   big babies like the German porker Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz), the spiteful princess Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), and the television (now videogame) sociopath Mike Teavee (Jordan Fry). If anything, they seem timelier now, in an era when so many kids do get everything they want. As Wonka vents his disdain, though, it's still a comic shock to see an adult interact with children as if they were something he'd prefer to be roasting on a spit.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  revives, in a sassier but more artful way, the pixilated  whimsy of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory . The earlier film was driven, of course, by the creepy cuddliness of Gene Wilder  the smile of cozy dimpled warmth giving way to hysteria, then snapping back. Burton and Depp push Wonka further, making him into a sinister enigma, and in flashbacks to his childhood we see how he got that way: His father (Christopher Lee), a dentist, treated candy like poison and forced the boy to wear a torture chamber of a head brace. If that all sounds a bit Freudian, what it does is turn the entire film into a fairy-tale meditation on our relationship to candy: why it's wrong to love it too little, or too much.
As the children are vanquished, one by one, from the chocolate factory, each done in by greedy overindulgence, Burton makes the factory a place of blooming danger and wonder. The army of live squirrels shelling walnuts, the sight of Violet blowing up into a blueberry  these are indelible Burton images. The director also has a blast reinventing Wonka's army of pint-size assistants, the Oompa-Loompas. All of them are played, with digital replication, by Deep Roy, who looks like the deadpan maître d' of an Indian restaurant, and they appear in songs of various styles and eras (Esther Williams, psychedelic rock), scored with catchy deviltry by Danny Elfman. Those Oompa-Loompas are the beat, and soul, of Burton's finest movie since Ed Wood : a madhouse kiddie musical with a sweet-and-sour heart.

 From the outside, Willy Wonka's factory is a grim, imposing industrial edifice towering over rows of red-brick shops and houses - something out of Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" planted in the landscape of Charles Dickens's "Hard Times."  It is not ugly, exactly - by now we are accustomed to seeing grandeur in this kind of architecture - but it is nonetheless forbidding. The interior, of course, is another story. This factory does not only turn out irresistible confections. As imagined by Tim Burton and his production designer, Alex McDowell, Wonka's candyworks is itself such a confection, a place of extravagant innovation and wild indulgence where the ordinary principles of physics, chemistry and human behavior do not apply.  As you might expect in such a place, not everything quite works. The man in charge, while a stickler for detail in some ways, is also prone to letting his imagination outrun his sense of discipline or proportion. There are some intriguing ideas that don't quite come off as planned and a few treats that leave behind a funny aftertaste. The fact that so much whimsy is contained within such somber walls lends your visit an intriguing complexity. There is pleasure, but also a shadow of menace - an inkling of the sinister in the midst of abundant, lovingly manufactured delight.  By now it will be clear that I'm not really talking about Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, but rather about "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Mr. Burton's wondrous and flawed new adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved novel. I call it wondrous because, in spite of lapses and imperfections, a few of them serious, Mr. Burton's movie succeeds in doing what far too few films aimed primarily at children even know how to attempt anymore, which is to feed - even to glut - the youthful appetite for aesthetic surprise.  The story will be familiar to much of the audience, either from the book or from the earlier film adaptation, directed by Mel Stuart and starring Gene Wilder, and this familiarity has perhaps freed Mr. Burton to concentrate on the machinery of visual fantasy. Many of the children watching will know, more or less, what is coming (and some, like my screening companions, will keep a running tally of what is and isn't in the book). But when certain familiar scenes hit the screen - a room full of walnut-sorting squirrels (real ones, by the way), an Oompa-Loompa chorus line, the splendid comeuppances of Augustus Gloop, Violet Beauregarde, Veruca Salt and Mike Teavee - their eyes will widen. And so will yours, since you've never seen anything quite like this before.  Apart from a few misguided flashbacks (which depart from both the spirit and the content of the book), "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," with the Burton mainstay Johnny Depp as the mischievous candy magnate, moves, like Dahl's original, in a straight line from one inspired set piece to the next. There is the chocolate room with its waterfall and edible flora, a television laboratory that also functions as a self-contained homage to Stanley Kubrick, and of course the Oompa-Loompas (all of them played by a single actor, Deep Roy), who sing Danny Elfman's techno show-tune arrangements of Dahl's cautionary rhymes. Most of the narrative is taken up by a tour of the mysterious factory, conducted by Wonka himself, and the film should be taken in a similar spirit, as an excursion through the prodigious, slightly scary mind of an obsessive inventor.  Of course, Mr. Burton's world, for all its weirdness, is by now a familiar place. Lately, though, it hasn't been as much fun to visit as it used to be. His recent films - "Sleepy Hollow," "Planet of the Apes," "Big Fish" - have seemed at once overwrought and curiously inert, lacking the wit of "Pee-wee's Big Adventure" and "Mars Attacks!" or the soulful expressionism of "Batman" and "Edward Scissorhands." But in this case the source material seems to have reawakened the director's imagination, as he has found both Dahl and his most famous creation to be kindred spirits.  The secret of Dahl's charm, and Wonka's, is that neither one seems to be an entirely nice person. Or, rather, neither has much use for the condescending sweetness that some adults adopt in the belief that children will mistake it for niceness. Dahl's sensibility was gleefully punitive; he was a scourge of bullies, brats and scolds, and a champion of unfussy decency against all manner of beastliness. The four children besides little Charlie Bucket who win entry to Wonka's factory are marvelously awful embodiments of ordinary vices, and Mr. Burton and the screenwriter, John August (who also wrote the script for "Big Fish"), have brought their awfulness discreetly up to date.  Violet Beauregarde (AnnaSophia Robb) is not merely an obsessive gum chewer, but a ruthlessly competitive power-pixie with a matching mom and shelves full of trophies in her suburban Atlanta home. Mike Teavee's antisocial tendencies, fed by the television Dahl loathed, have been compounded by video games. Far from a couch potato, the boy (played by Jordan Fry) is a sociopathic embodiment of the currently voguish theory that such entertainment makes children smarter.  Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegratz) is still a glutton, of course, and Veruca Salt (Julia Winter) a spoiled rich girl. For his part, Charlie (Freddie Highmore, who also played opposite Mr. Depp in "Finding Neverland") is a child of picturesque poverty. His home, with its caved-in roof and single room dominated by a bed full of grandparents (including the marvelous Irish actor David Kelly as Grandpa Joe), are as true to Dahl's book as anything in the movie.  But most of all there is Willy Wonka, the latest - and perhaps the strangest - of Mr. Depp's eccentric characterizations. Jack Sparrow, the louche buccaneer in "Pirates of the Caribbean," put many viewers in mind of Keith Richard. There has already been some debate about possible real-life models for Wonka. The preternaturally smooth features and high-pitched voice - as well as the fantasy kingdom into which selected children are invited - may suggest Michael Jackson. Mr. Depp, in a recent interview, has dropped the name of the Vogue editor Anna Wintour. To me, the lilting, curiously accented voice sounded like an unholy mash-up of Mr. Rogers and Truman Capote, but really, who knows? The best thing about this Wonka, who tiptoes on the narrow boundary between whimsy and creepiness, is that he defies assimilation or explanation.  Or at least he should. Inexplicably, and at great risk to the integrity of the movie, the filmmakers have burdened him with a psychological back story pulled out of a folder in some studio filing cabinet. Why does Wonka spend his days confecting sweets? Why, in the movies these days, does anyone - artist, serial killer, superhero - do anything? An unhappy childhood, of course. I'll grant that it was clever to make Wonka's dad a mad, sugar-hating dentist (and to cast the unmatchably sinister Christopher Lee in the role), but to force a redemptive story of father-son reconciliation onto this story is worse than lazy; it is a betrayal of a book that the filmmakers seem otherwise to have not only understood, but also honored. Sentimentality about family relationships does not feature heavily in Dahl's world. Matilda, for example, the title character of another Dahl book, was more than happy to give herself up for adoption.  Luckily, though, the sumptuous, eerie look and mood of the movie make it possible to ignore this dispiriting and superfluous adherence to convention. There is simply too much pleasure to be found in Wonka's world to get too hung up about his relationship with his dad. The real lesson of "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" is - or should be - that pleasure and curiosity are their own rewards. "Candy doesn't have to have a point," Charlie says to the skeptical Mike Teavee. "That's why it's candy."  "Charlie and the Cocolate Factory" is rated PG (Parental Guidance suggested). It has some mildly suggestive humor and a few situations that may disturb younger children.

The wondrous surfaces have a weird undercurrent that won't go away in "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Tim Burton's richly elaborated take on Roald Dahl's beloved children's book. Entertaining and fabulously imaginative in many ways, this second bigscreen rendition of the late author's modest morality tale on the wages of unbridled excess sports excesses of its own. Still, most discussion will inevitably center on Johnny Depp's utterly eccentric performance as reclusive chocolate magnate Willy Wonka. Kids as well as many adult fans of the star and director should combine to make the Warner Bros. release a sizable hit (if distrib could do it with "The Polar Express," it should be able to do it with this). But a fair number of grown-ups might find themselves becoming more preoccupied by film's inscrutable subtext than by the repetitive story itself.
In a role imagined by Dahl as ideal for the late British comedian Spike Milligan and played in 1971 by Gene Wilder, Depp, who channeled Keith Richards to great effect in "Pirates of the Caribbean," here inescapably comes across as a close relation to Michael Jackson -- intentionally or not. The fastidious pseudo-Edwardian garb, lavender gloves, walking stick, immaculately bobbed hair, androgynous air, inhumanly bluish porcelain skin and childish intonations, along with his often snippy and literally dismissive attitude toward the kids he invites into his fabulous domain, create an oddness as likely to give pause as to enchant.
The very idea of remaking the original film, released by Paramount as "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory," is sacrilegious to some who grew up on it, although it is hard to overlook that film's lackluster musical numbers and complete lack of visual style. Burton's entry is scarcely deficient in the latter category, as "Charlie" rates as one of the most riotous explosions of color since "The Gang's All Here," and the advanced sophistication of effects makes so much possible now that was inconceivable three decades back.
Dazzling opening credits sequence, a detailing of the chocolate manufacturing process set to throbbing musical accompaniment, instantly creates high expectations, which are indeed fulfilled for the first 35 minutes. In an unnamed great industrial city very much like London, little Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore, Depp's splendid co-star in "Finding Neverland") lives an emotionally warm but physically threadbare existence with his parents and two sets of grandparents in a ramshackle shack. This structure itself is a twisted marvel of design worthy of a great German Expressionist film, its occupants a lively lot deftly caricatured by superior thesps.
Burton excels at the barbed exposition. In bold, controlled brush strokes, he reveals how Charlie has long heard the tale of Willy Wonka from his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly), who toiled at the factory until all the workers were dismissed 15 years ago. Since then, chocolate production has continued apace, but no one knows how, and not a soul has glimpsed the owner himself. 
Suddenly, a contest is announced in which five kids who find special gold tickets hidden in Wonka chocolates will be invited to go on a personal tour of the enormous factory to be conducted by the mysterious tycoon. In pithy and amusing fashion, pic renders the international frenzy the competition sets off, as the parents in privileged families buy up thousands of candy bars to indulge their sprigs while Charlie's family can only muster enough money to give him one chance at the gold.
The first four winners are dreadful brats: There's German fatso Augustus Gloop, who stuffs his face with chocolate all day; snotty Brit aristo Veruca Salt, who's every whim is Daddy's command; gum-chewing Yank brat Violet Beauregarde, whose mom is an older carbon copy; and American Southern smart-ass Mike Teavee, a violent videogame freak.
All these loathsome creatures, accompanied by one parent, are spoiled, self-centered, ill-mannered louts set up as the fully deserving recipients of Willy Wonka's unexpected, sadistic streak and rep Dahl's comment on the undisciplined indulgence of the privileged classes. Deprived Charlie, who miraculously becomes the fifth winner, seems a simple saint by comparison, and he shows up with Grandpa Joe outside the Wonka factory on a wintry day in breathless anticipation of his reward.
But just when the film seems poised to take flight with Depp's entrance and its "Wizard of Oz"-like passage from the deliberately muted "real" world into Wonka's fantastical one, it begins deflating. Having been out of contact with other human beings for 15 years can perhaps explain Wonka's curious quirks, strange pronouncements and his blanching whenever approached by the kids, whose entreaties often provoke his instant disdain. But the flashbacks invented by scenarist John August to show the boy Willy's falling out with his dentist father (Christopher Lee) only raise the question of why the adult Willy lost his English accent.
As the factory tour proceeds from one extraordinary chamber to another -- the first of production designer Alex McDowell's fanciful creations features hills and dales of green riven by a river of chocolate -- one child visitor after another is "eliminated" in semi-gruesome fashion. Unfortunately, these richly deserved comeuppances become successively less amusing, and they continue with musical production number accompaniment that similarly starts out smartly but rapidly pales.
These song-and-dance interludes feature the Oompa-Loompas, diminutive creatures Wonka imported from a dismal foreign habitat to fill his labor needs. This aspect of Dahl's 1964 story has always had a slightly discomfiting colonialist tinge to it, an impression scarcely diminished in Burton's handling. Casting of a single actor, Deep Roy, to be visually multiplied to portray all the Oompa-Loompas, initially seems audacious but becomes tiresome, even though composer Danny Elfman (who also provides the vocals) works hard to give each tune a strong musical definition.
Before the trip is over, "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" has gone from delectable to curdled, and Depp's performance has shrunk from bizarrely riveting to one-note and vaguely creepy, turning Willy Wonka into yet another of Burton's antisocial weirdoes. But then this is scarcely the first time a Burton film has started out great only to lose its way with fanciful doodlings and lack of secure moorings.
As usual with the director, pic is immaculately made, with invention to be found in every corner and every scene. Casting of all the supporting roles is terrific.
Film's wide release July 15 will be accompanied by simultaneous engagements in Imax theaters.

With the Michael Jackson  trial over, it's a shade less discomfiting to watch Johnny Depp , as reclusive candy wizard Willy Wonka , escort five children and their guardians through his factory-fortress in Tim Burton 's enjoyable Charlie and the Chocolate Factory . Depp's cadences occasionally echo his double-W  predecessor Gene Wilder 's, but his eccentricity is less florid. Hysterically awkward in his Jacko-pale skin (and Anna Wintour  haircut), Wonka-Depp is a monster of remoteness who reads boilerplate off cue cards, relates only to his knee-high Oompa-Loompa workers, and can't enunciate the word parents .
Roald Dahl 's 1964 kid-lit classic is a dose of moral entertainment packed with enough flights of fancy for a dozen books. The author disliked Mel Stuart 's 1971 version (thus scotching any plans to film the even wilder Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator ), and while it's hard to guess whether he'd cotton to this Burtonization, the current film has plenty of soul amid the cartoon-machined. Finding Neverland 's Freddie Highmore  is believable and likable as good egg Charlie Bucket , son of a destitute toothpaste cap twister-onner. He's the last to find a golden ticket tucked in a bar of Wonka chocolate and joins the other winners for a day-long tour of Wonka's Xanadu.
The rest of the pint-size cohort epitomize childhood's four deadly sins: gluttony in D chowhound Augustus Gloop  (Philip Wiegratz ), greed in spoiled brat Veruca Salt  (Julia Winter ), competitiveness in self-promoting gum chewer Violet Beauregarde  (Annasophia Robb ), and aggression in first-person-shooter virtuoso Mike Teavee  (Jordon Fry ). (Winter is especially fine; impatient for the factory doors to open, she demands of her dad, "Make time go faster!") Burton's zippy introductions to these grotesques hit just the right note, and we're a little unwilling to lose themas good as Highmore is, he's necessarily a bit of a cipher by comparison. For the tour is actually a rigged affair, a process of elimination as efficient as that in Ten Little Indians . ("I do say, that seemed all rather rehearsed," notes Veruca's father, after seeing the Oompas celebrate the first victim's removal.)
Christopher Nolan 's Batman Begins  has Bruce Wayne  confronting childhood traumathink of Liam Neeson 's ninja-mensch as a very hands-on shrink. (It reads like apocryphal Freud: the case of the "Bat Man.") In a goofier spirit, C&CF  explains Wonka's weirdness by getting inside his head. Most of the brainwork comes courtesy of Charlie's innocent questions, each of which ("Do you remember the first candy you ever ate?") plunges Wonka into mournful reverie. It turns out that his dentist father (Christopher Lee ) forbade him all sweets, even on Halloween, leading to a filial rupture. (Call this one the "Candy Man.") This is screenwriter John August 's addition to Dahl's taleit's superfluous, but executed with a light touch and complete with hilariously significant wordplay (hair for heir ). It also works as a razzperhaps unwittingof Big Fish , Burton's ponderously whimsical melodrama of father-son disconnect, which August also scripted.
A few witty allusions pop up: Wonka's pose at a ribbon cutting recalls Burton-Depp's Edward Scissorhands  , and Mike Teavee's video transmigration lands him in 2001 , where a chocolate bar replaces Kubrick's primate-provoking monolith. Though Wonka tells his guests (upon entering a candied meadow) to "try some of my grass," the inherent psychedelia is curbed in favor of comedy. (The Oompa-Loompas, all played by Deep Roy , are much less of a bad trip than their orange-fleshed 1971 counterparts.) Fun and nourishing, Charlie 's the topsy-turvy equivalent of a three-course dinner in a single stick of gum.
