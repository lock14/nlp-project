The Reader  is a pretty good screen adaptation of a very good, semiautobiographical novel about guilt and reconciliation among a German generation that came of age after the rise and fall of Nazism. The film is notable for its nice performances, its handsome photography, and its very active music. If the preceding praise sounds generic, so is the movie: Everything is admirable, worthy, and muffled in a blanket of Britishness in this well-bred production, which reunites director Stephen Daldry with screenwriter David Hare six years after The Hours . But nothing pierces, shocks, or challenges with an originality that meets the source material even halfway.
Certainly the story, by Bernhard Schlink, is a grabber (millions in Oprah's Book Club have already grabbed it). Michael (fresh-faced newcomer David Kross), a teenage boy in postwar Germany, tumbles into a secretive affair with Hanna (Kate Winslet), a passionate older woman. The liaison is hot with sex, during which Winslet once again demonstrates her endearing talent for being honest while naked; as foreplay, Michael reads great books to his literature-hungry lover. Then Hanna vanishes  and when Michael sees her next, he's a law student observing a courtroom where she's on trial for crimes committed in Hitler's name.
Ralph Fiennes has perhaps the toughest job, playing the morose adult Michael  a version, we can assume, of the author. Fiennes masters the default demeanor of someone perpetually pained. The Reader , similarly, represents a received notion of a significant movie with a Holocaust theme. B–

 “The Reader” is a scrupulously tasteful — more on that word tasteful later — film about an erotic affair that turns to love. It is also, more obliquely, about the Holocaust and the generation of Germans who came of age after that catastrophe. This, at any rate, is what the film would have us believe it’s about, though mostly it involves Kate Winslet, her taut belly and limbs gleaming under the caressing light, deflowering a very surprised-looking teenage boy who grows up to become a depressed-looking Ralph Fiennes.  Directed by Stephen Daldry and fussily adapted by David Hare from a slender novel by the German author Bernhard Schlink, the story opens in 1995 Germany with Mr. Fiennes as a lawyer, Michael Berg, bidding an uncomfortable goodbye to an apparent one-night stand. (He makes the woman breakfast, but stands at an awkward remove when she leaves.) From the cool, sleek surfaces of his carefully appointed apartment and the downward curve of his mouth, it appears that Michael either lives an ordered if unhappy life or that Mr. Daldry has no fear when it comes to embracing stereotypes about chilly Germans. Both turn out to be true, as the nominal reasons for Michael’s pained smile are excavated through fluid flashbacks and somber revelations.  The first flashback occurs shortly after the doleful opener, with Michael staring out a window at a passing train, an image that transports him to 1958, where his 15-year-old self (David Kross) sits hunched inside a streetcar in obvious pain. The young Michael rushes into the rainy streets and retches inside a building vestibule. A woman (Ms. Winslet) materializes, as if from nowhere, briskly cleans the mess and tells him to follow her. He does and, not long after, inside a flat lined with hanging nylons and clutter, she orders the boy out of his clothes and into the tub, before opening a towel and her legs to him. A discreet affair ensues, characterized by shots of decorously writhing flesh, tears, smiles, shouts and literature: Michael reads aloud to Hanna.  In time the lovers separate,  and the story skips to the 1960s,  with Michael wearing sideburns and attending law school. One day a professor (Bruno Ganz) takes him and a few other students to a court where some women are being tried for Nazi war crimes, which is how Hanna re-enters Michael’s life. During the proceedings he comes to realize her secret, her shame, which has nothing to do with her being a Nazi prison guard: she’s illiterate. She goes to prison, years pass, and Mr. Fiennes takes over for Mr. Kross. Eventually a Holocaust survivor (Lena Olin) living in a swank Manhattan apartment delivers a stern lecture to Michael about exploiting the Holocaust, an admonition that arrives too late for this fatuous film.  Paradoxically, Mr. Hare’s apparent attempt to deepen or underline the novel’s ideas about the past informing the present, by kinking up its linear chronology with flashbacks, proves crippling: scrambling the time frame, so that the story repeatedly points to the past, only exposes the deep vein of self-pity that runs through the novel, flattening Mr. Schlink’s already unpersuasive bid at generational soul-seeking. The problems are evident in the film’s first flashback to Michael on that streetcar. The location would be meaningless (the scene isn’t in the novel), but this is Germany 13 years after the end of World War II, and an unhappy boy in a rail car isn’t just an unhappy boy: he is an allusion to the millions transported to the death camps.  Mr. Schlink writes that “the pain I went through because of my love for Hanna was, in a way, the fate of my generation, a German fate.” In the novel and the film — which monumentalizes every trembling lip and fluttering eyelash, turning human gestures into Kodak moments — Michael’s pain turns him not just into Hanna’s victim, but also a kind of survivor. Outrageously, Hanna is a victim too, because she took the guard job only to hide her illiteracy, as if illiteracy were an excuse for barbarism. Not that the film dwells on barbarism: beauty is its currency, from the cinematography (by Chris Menges and Roger Deakins) that makes Ms. Winslet’s pale skin creamy, to the immaculate production design (Brigitte Broch). Even Michael’s visit to an extermination camp is beautifully lighted.  There’s no surprise, of course, in a Hollywood movie designed for adult audiences (and for the awards season) featuring attractive lighting, seductive stars and glossy production values. And certainly there are things to recommend here, notably the affecting Mr. Kross and the rumpled, professionally weary Mr. Ganz. Ms. Winslet looks lovely, even when wearing a smear of wrinkles and a little gray during the later scenes, but she’s playing an impossible character. Her stern mien, clipped enunciation (most of the cast speaks in German-accented English) and abrupt, metronymic gestures are an uneasy fit for this naturally appealing and open actress and occasionally tilt into near-comedy, as in the scene in which Hanna furiously scrubs Michael in her bathtub with a brush and momentarily turns into a very naughty nurse.  Although the commercial imperatives that drive a movie like this one are understandable — the novel was a best seller and an Oprah’s Book Club selection, for starters — you have to wonder who, exactly, wants or perhaps needs to see another movie about the Holocaust that embalms its horrors with artfully spilled tears and asks us to pity a death-camp guard. You could argue that the film isn’t really about the Holocaust, but about the generation that grew up in its shadow, which is what the book insists. But the film is neither about the Holocaust nor about those Germans who grappled with its legacy: it’s about making the audience feel good about a historical catastrophe that grows fainter with each new tasteful interpolation.  “The Reader” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Discreet nudity and coitus.

Sober intelligence goes only so far in crafting an effective bigscreen version of the international bestseller �The Reader.� German author Bernhard Schlink�s succinct, widely admired 1995 novel, which parts company with most Holocaust literature by placing a perpetrator, not a victim, at the story�s center, uses a late-1950s affair between a former concentration camp guard and a teenager half her age to explore both generations� difficulty in coming to terms with German war guilt. Stephen Daldry�s film is sensitively realized and dramatically absorbing, but comes across as an essentially cerebral experience without gut impact. Classy package will appeal to upscale specialized auds and the bookish set but pic will have trouble crossing over to the general public Stateside. Offshore prospects look stronger.
Crisscrossing narrative lines that were laid out chronologically in the novel, David Hare�s astringent screenplay dispenses gradations of accountability across the decades, beginning with Nazi functionaries who might well have been just �doing their jobs� to members of the �second generation� of the postwar period who had to decide how to react to and judge their elders. The intense sexual relationship serves as a simple, effective metaphor for the elemental generational link, as well as for the shame and uncertainty of how to deal with the fallout.
A chance meeting and an act of kindness lead to a first tango in Neustadt between Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), a cold, severe but nonetheless attractive woman in her mid-30s who collects tram fares, and 15-year-old Michael Berg (David Kross), a bright, well-built student who lives with his middle-class family. Transforming with startling but convincing rapidity from an uncertain teen into a cocky young man, Michael begins dropping by Hanna�s flat every day after school for his sentimental education, which is illustrated by Daldry judiciously but with plenty of nudity.
Title stems from Hanna�s request that Michael read to her after or, preferably, before their physical exertions. His selections stick to the classics: �The Odyssey,� �The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn� and Chekhov, for starters. When the �kid,� as Hanna always calls him, launches into �Lady Chatterley�s Lover,� she deems it �disgusting� before instructing him to continue reading. Michael takes Hanna on a country outing one day, writes a poem about her and is sufficiently smitten to rebuff the attentions of even his most attractive female classmates.
But one day, Hanna is gone, her flat emptied out. Story proper then jumps eight years to 1966, when Michael is a law student under the tutelage of Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz). When their class attends the trial of several middle-aged women who worked as SS guards at concentration camps during the war, one of them, to Michael�s horror, is Hanna.
Michael tells no one of his personal connection; in fact, we have previously heard the older incarnation of Michael (Ralph Fiennes), who�s become a lawyer, tell his daughter (Hannah Herzsprung), �I�m aware I wasn�t always open with you. I�m not open with anyone.� 
As the trial wears on, however, his fear of revelation begins to tear him up inside, as he possesses some information that could help Hanna�s defense. Thus are the attitudes of younger Germans toward Nazi crimes in which they had no direct involvement held up for scrutiny, as part of the necessarily gradual course of processing the truth, reconciling the generations and moving ahead as individuals and a nation.
Fiennes� middle-aged Michael, who is seen early on trying to connect with his daughter, comes to the fore in the latter stages as the Michael-Hanna drama plays out its final act in an ironic manner that speaks to the potential of rehabilitation and never-too-late education. One of the film�s best scenes is a sort-of postscript, in which Michael goes to New York City to visit a wealthy, stylish woman (Lena Olin) who wrote a book with her mother about surviving the camp and the subsequent conflagration where Hanna exercised authority. Interchange between Fiennes and Olin has a snap and electricity missing elsewhere despite dedicated efforts across the board.
A central problem with �The Reader� as a film is that one can never look inside the character of Hanna. Her life and behavior are invariably assessed from the outside -- what she represents to Michael, the way the court and history take stock of her actions -- but never by her. In fact, she denies that her own self-evaluation is of any importance. �It doesn�t matter what I feel, it doesn�t matter what I think,� she insists when asked about wartime atrocities. �The dead are still dead.�
Winslet supplies a haunting shell to this internally decimated woman, one who can perhaps momentarily escape from her shame through sex but for whom there is no past she can possibly face and no future to anticipate. She and Kross enact the intimate scenes with impressive delicacy and credible desire, and the young German actor, who has rounder, fleshier features than Fiennes but still manages the match, shows confidence and promise (much is made in the press materials about how the production shut down until his 18th birthday before embarking upon the sex scenes). Fiennes deftly invests the grown-up Michael with an emotional limp, and the decision to have all the actors speak English with a softly suggestive German accent works pretty well.
Supporting cast and locations have been smartly chosen, and the modern Germany of the later scenes contrasts sharply with the Old World hangover look of the �50s. Score by Nico Muhly is supple, unusual and superbly supportive. 
Film looks splendid, pretty much a given when both Chris Menges and Roger Deakins are credited. Reportedly, Deakins prepared the picture and began shooting, mostly with the Fiennes material. But when the production halted for a while during the writers� strike, Deakins moved on to �Doubt� and Menges took over as cinematographer when lensing recommenced.
The late producing partners Anthony Minghella and Sydney Pollack receive a special �in loving memory� dedication. Another producer, Scott Rudin, removed his name from the film a couple of months ago due to disputes with Harvey and Bob Weinstein over rushing to finish it before year�s end. 


Like Doubt , Stephen Daldry 's The Reader  is low-budget, high-profile, and beamed straight at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , Category of High Moral Tone. Only in this case, the stakes are way higher and the attitude muted to a fault. Based on a partly autobiographical novel by Bernhard Schlink , The Reader  examines German culpability for the Holocaust through the story of a love affair between a 15-year-old boy and a woman more than twice his age, who later turns out to have been a tiny cog in the wheel of the Third Reich . In 1995, when the book was first published, the rave reviews for its courage in going there at all were followed by angry letters to the editor accusing Schlink of making a victim out of a former concentration-camp guard. Humanizing someone isn't the same as apologizing for them—the horror of Hitler  was precisely that he was human, which implicates us all—but having read the book twice, I can't make up my mind on that one. Which is rather the point, for Schlink's subject is the bewilderment and moral uncertainty of a German generation whose parents maintained a stubborn silence about what they knew and did—or didn't know and didn't do—in the war. The Reader  is a book about the appalling cost of keeping quiet about genocide and about the possibility of recovering, understanding, and forgiving the past.
Mimicking the novel's back-and-forth structure, the movie puts its head down and plods grimly through the memories of emotionally constipated law professor Michael Berg  (Ralph Fiennes , for whom the role might have been written) of his summer-long postwar affair with tight-lipped tram conductress Hanna (Kate Winslet ), to whom, significantly, he reads Chekhov and Tolstoy in between bouts of carnal abandon. Young Michael is played by the very good young German actor David Kross , looking chuffed as the Cheshire Cat for the opportunity to begin his career in bed with a buck-naked Winslet, whose effortless blend of wounded fragility and tempered steel provides The Reader  whatever momentum it can rustle up.
After vanishing from Michael's life one day without warning, Hanna reappears years later, middle-aged and defiant as she stands trial for her crimes, then old and baggy and defeated—yet still unremorseful—as she waits to get out of prison. Hanna has a secret that, once revealed, will either evoke your pity or cause you to shrug along with a survivor of her past crimes and say, "So what?" As a literary device, her cover-up is a little clumsy, yet it's of enormous consequence in how we judge her, the former lover whose life she may have destroyed and vice versa, and indeed all of Germany. Where Schlink leaves that up to us, Daldry and screenwriter David Hare  sew it all up with a moment of fatally damp redemption.
Schlink writes with a studied lack of sensationalism, in terse prose that heightens the drama on the page, but also makes the story extremely difficult to film. Sidestepping the usual Auschwitz -camp footage and unfolding mostly in a dingy bedroom and a provincial courthouse, The Reader  strives to honor Schlink's restraint and his struggle to avoid cliché. But like many narrative filmmakers who walk on their tippy-toes when dealing with the Holocaust, neither Daldry nor Hare seems eager to make the material his own. Add to their timidity a pack of production troubles—including a distracted director who was simultaneously working on the Broadway version of Billy Elliot  , two feral executives (Harvey Weinstein  and Scott Rudin ) scrapping publicly over the release date, and the death of two beloved producers (Anthony Minghella  and Sidney Pollack ) during production—and it's not hard to see why the movie version came out such a flat, respectful pudding. There's more life, energy, and imagination in the thrilling final seconds of Daldry's feather-light movie Billy Elliot , when a grown-up Billy limbers up in his Swan Lake  costume in the wings of an English theater, than in the long, lifelessly worthy road taken by The Reader .
