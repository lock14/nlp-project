An awful lot of good talent has been squandered in this by-the-numbers film version of the bestselling tell-all about the lifestyles and child-rearing habits of the rich residents of New York's Upper East Side. Last time out, co-writers and directors Springer Berman and Pulcini scored an artistic success with American Splendor
, their film adaptation of Harvey Pekar's surly yet touching comic books about quotidian life in America. Their rendition of The Nanny Diaries
, however, is flat-footed and tiresome, hitting the same notes over and over while tossing in an unnecessary romance and an acting performance by the musician Alicia Keys in a failed attempt to keep things spicy. Johansson and Linney are both excellent in the leads, as the college grad who takes a job as a nanny and the socialite/trophy wife whose self-obsession has no bounds. Linney, in particular, is at the top of her game here, with every inflection of her line delivery as perfect as her tasteful coif and grooming. Despite these well-shaped depictions (including that of American Splendor
's Giamatti as the largely absent dad and husband), the film lacks any real bite or sass. It's hard to empathize with Annie Braddock (Johansson), a new college grad who's so daunted by the brightness of her future that she decides to downgrade her plans and accept a live-in nanny gig that Mrs. X (Linney) improbably offers to her when their paths cross in Central Park. Mrs. X is as stereotypically snooty as her son, Grayer (Art), is bratty  � but of course, that's only until Annie (whose name everyone, in one of the film's running jokes, mistakes as Nanny) tames his overprivileged and underloved spirit. The same points are reiterated a number of times, though little evolves or changes. That's where the comments of a best friend (Keys) and mom (Murphy) help to fill out the story, as well as a coy romance with a guy (Evans) in an apartment upstairs. Annie's desire to become an anthropologist instead of the business exec she was schooled to become causes her to view everything she witnesses on the Upper East Side as a Museum of Natural History diorama. It's an effective device, although it seems somewhat similar to the ways in which the filmmakers handled the comic-books-to-real-life transitions in American Splendor
. With all these spoons full of sugar, where's Mary Poppins when you need her?


In "The Nanny Diaries," a prim young woman slaves for a seasoned Manhattan gorgon, and both ladies learn a thing or two. Here the devil wears Pucci, and she has a tony address and a 10-store-a-day shopping habit. But she's not much of a mother. Never fear, 
the movie happily humiliates some maternal instinct into her.
Adapted from the comic strip of a bestseller and directed by the married team of Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, the movie upgrades the book to a live-action cartoon meant to blow the lid off all the neglectful mommying being done among the Upper East Side's gentry. As expos�s go, this one is old news. Apparently, a lot of rich children are being raised by the help. And, shockingly enough, the rotten women who've done the hiring don't treat anybody better than they treat themselves. But the filmmakers think they've found a way to freshen up the material: anthropology.
That's what Annie Braddock (Scarlett Johansson), the movie's 21-year-old heroine, majored in. And in the first scenes, she walks through the Museum of Natural History looking at dioramas of mothers from other cultures. This sounds like a clever idea. Then it turns reductive. Annie deduces that a Manhattan woman can be explained as a type (fashionista, Central Park bag lady, etc.) and carries a "field guide" to record her encounters.
Annie, of course, is a type herself: the Scarlett Johansson drifter. Like Johansson's characters in "Lost in Translation" and "Match Point," Annie doesn't know what she wants. She even tells a potential employer she doesn't know who she is -- and that's when we know we're in for a slog. The movie treats its smart idea stupidly. We have to spend the entire movie waiting for Annie to realize she's as perceptive as we already know she is. This is the story of how she smartens up, and how the work she winds up doing is not just work, it's research
 -- presumably for the lucrative roman � clef she intends to write.
In the movie's last good scene (it comes about 20 minutes in), Annie has just finished rescuing a small child from an accident when the boy's mother (Laura Linney) gallops over to thank her -- not for saving the kid, per se, but for saving her from searching any further for child care. This is a funny, nicely done introduction that crisply, wittily mocks some rich mothers' narcissism. When the woman hears Annie's name, she assumes it's "Nanny," which is what she spends the rest of the movie calling Johansson's character. For her "case study," Annie calls her new employers Mr. and Mrs. X. (The kid, who's lovably played by Nicholas Reese Art, keeps his name: Grayer.) Linney brings a lot of her intelligence to bear on a part that doesn't need it. But she doesn't want us to like or respect this woman. She just needs us to find Mrs. X horrid enough to laugh at her. Sometimes we do.
But there are too many goofy, uninspired sitcom antics. Mrs. X makes outrageous demands, and Annie breaks her neck trying to meet them. Mrs. X needlessly installs a "Nanny Cam" to catch Annie -- in the act of what? A generically cute boy down the hall (Chris Evans, in yet another plain white T-shirt part) catches Annie in one compromising position after another. Mrs. X, meanwhile, spends her free time being frivolous and fretting over her philandering businessman spouse, whom Paul Giamatti plays as a cool caveman. His creepiness seems imported from a more serious movie-of-the-week.
Berman and Pulcini's previous movie was "American Splendor," a small independent comedy, with Giamatti as the grubby comic-book writer Harvey Pekar. This is their first Hollywood assignment, and they don't seem to think much of it. The whole thing teeters between sympathy and condescension. That anthropology device is a way to adapt the material without deigning to actually touch it. So the comedy is synthetic and the emotional truths insincere.
Occasionally, Annie will express a thought about the world ("One had to wonder what kind of culture would turn a father's business card into a security blanket"), as though she studied Carrie Bradshaw in college instead of reading Claude Levi-Strauss. One has to wonder what kind of movie about a nanny focuses entirely on a woman like Annie. The movie explains that as a young, single, white, American college graduate, she's extremely eligible. "The Chanel bag of nannies," Annie puts it. And Hispanic, Caribbean, Indian, and Irish women throw in their two cents, but the filmmakers seem uncomfortable with the surrounding 
racial, social, and 
class politics. Admittedly, the brief shot of a nanny and her charge at a costume party dressed as Condoleezza Rice and little George W. Bush is quite a statement. But the shaming boilerplate feminist prerogatives of Annie's single nurse mother (Donna Murphy) and her best friend (Alicia Keys) don't make a dent in the movie's consciousness.
Comparing "The Nanny Diaries" to "The Devil Wears Prada" is inviting. Both movies attempt to rethink their meager chick-lit sources. But "The Devil Wears Prada" used Hollywood glamour to make smart points about working women and their choices. "The Nanny Diaries" has its heroine floating over Manhattan like Mary Poppins (the red umbrella has been plucked off the Travelers Insurance building). None of the characters in "Prada" were fish in a barrel. You could make sushi with the women in "The Nanny Diaries," though. The movie's banal fantasies badly chafe any anthropological consideration of what a girl should do with her career. This isn't life. It's Lifetime.


         THERE'S a throwaway gag near the end of "The Nanny Diaries" that hints at some of what's so perplexing and off-the-mark about this plodding and generic adaptation, which by rights should have been pure, eat-the-rich summer fun: Relaxing on the beach in Nantucket, a Park Avenue dowager shoos away her 6-year-old grandson when his nanny dashes off to use the bathroom. See, Grandma doesn't want to be disturbed -- she's on the last chapter of "The Devil Wears Prada."
 
 It's not particularly funny as moments go, but it is particularly telling. Like its boring heroine, "The Nanny Diaries" ambivalently mocks what it aspires to, or aspires to what it mocks. . . . one or the other, it's hard to tell. Based on the 2002 novel "The Nanny Diaries," written by Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus, the movie provides a more-or-less faithful enactment of the major plot points, taking care to omit most of what made the book enjoyable. Surprisingly well executed and well received for a co-written hatchet job, the novel paved the way for an avalanche of revenge-of-the-underling tales of which the far more tantrum-y and mean-spirited "Prada" was a major part. As it happened, the devil not only beat the nanny to the screen, but it pulled off the rare feat of improving significantly on its source material. So it seems especially self-defeating for a character in "The Nanny Diaries" to be so caught up in "The Devil Wears Prada," as though the "The Nanny Diaries" were holding up "The Devil" as a standard and then failing to reach it.
 


         






   It's especially surprising given the pedigree of its writer-directors, former documentarians Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, who co-wrote the excellent Harvey Pekar biopic "American Splendor." Nothing that was quirky or inventive about that film is in evidence here, however. The story has been reduced to so much condescending chick-flickery that adding a twist at the end pulls what remained of the movie's teeth and turns it into straight-ahead ego-porn for DIY mommies.
 
 The book was based on the experiences of its authors, child-psychology majors who put themselves through college working as nannies for the super rich of the Upper East Side, logging 30 such jobs between them. The characters of Nanny, Mr. and Mrs. X and 4-year-old Grayer may have been composites, but they were so dead-on they launched a thousand paranoid trips along Park Avenue. The million little details that brought to life the rarefied world of financiers, trophy wives, their neglected offspring and the put-upon servant classes that cater to them have been distilled here into a cute (but suspiciously familiar) device hinging on the main character's new back-story.
 
 Scarlett Johansson plays Annie, known throughout most of the film as "Nanny," a recent college graduate who bungles her interview at an investment bank and accidentally lands a gig as Grayer's (Nicholas Reese Art) caretaker when she saves him from being hit by a scooter in Central Park. Unlike the Nanny of the novel, an NYU child-development major from a warm, upper middle-class family, Johansson's Annie/Nanny is a recent graduate who majored in business, minored in anthropology and is so thrown for a loop by life that she orders a burger at Bergdorf's. Her mother (Donna Murphy), a grim-faced nurse, raised her on her own and dreams of Annie transcending her background (her dad lives in a double-wide trailer!) by way of a job on Wall Street. Annie, naturally, dreams of becoming an anthropologist, a la Margaret Mead.
 
 This allows the filmmakers to catalog the various tribes of New York by placing them in individual dioramas at the Museum of Natural History. The diorama device is fitting, because we're given next to no glimpse into the inner life of Mrs. X -- the trophy wife of a master of the universe whose fortress is forever being assailed by other, younger aspiring trophy wives. Mrs. X is played by the fabulous Laura Linney, who, burnished to a high gloss, perfectly embodies the brittle, miserably lonely socialite whose days appear to be an uninterrupted orgy of "me-time." Here, however, Mrs. X has been stripped of the keening desperation that made her character so riveting in the book. Her demands are presented as little more than a catalog of injustices perpetrated on our heroine instead of as frantic attempts to live up to a standard of perfection so exotic and perpetually out of reach as to be all but designed to drive people insane.
 
 Paul Giamatti sails through an easy stereotype as the cheating mergers-and-acquisitions mogul for whom a wife is a toy and a child is an asset, but other than lend the character an unexpected piggy coarseness, he doesn't do much with the part. More boring still is Nanny's love interest, the Harvard Hottie (Chris Evans), a blandly handsome stick figure who serves no purpose other than to give our heroine a shot at the life she's come to know and love-hate. And lest we think Nanny a hypocrite in the making, we're informed that H.H.'s life hasn't been quite as charmed as his address and educational background would suggest. Sure, he was raised by nannies, but it's because his mother died. (Otherwise, surely. . . )
 
 Stripped of her determination to do a good job despite the impossible circumstances, Johannson's character is wishy-washy and rudderless. No longer does she take it upon herself to keep hidden from Mrs. X a piece of stray lingerie that Mr. X's mistress has purposefully planted among the bedclothes. Instead she passively allows Mrs. X to find the garment in the laundry and insist that it must belong to her.
 
 What to make of changes like this one, other than to assume that Hollywood squeamishness precludes our squeaky-clean heroine from participating in a deception, or sympathizing with the devil? Morphing Nanny from a college student gaining valuable experience in her chosen field to an insecure, directionless post-grad comes off as the mother of all pulled punches. It was interesting to ponder the shock and awe of a well-adjusted member of the liberal meritocracy as she sank deeper into the maw of the insanely privileged classes. It's considerably less so to be presented with a classic master-slave dichotomy.
 
 Of course, it's a cardinal rule of the so-called chick-flick (the genre that hates itself) that the heroine's virtues and troubles revolve around nothing more than her under-appreciated, inoffensive cuteness. The cliché of the hapless, humiliated young girl clumsily trying to navigate the world like a dizzy guppy in a tank full of barracudas has become so compulsory that the first we see of Annie, she's falling on the dais at graduation. Any inadvertent class issues raised during the course of her attempt to find herself, love and career satisfaction are dispatched by pitting the deserving poor(-ish) against the suspiciously moneyed. The actual poor, who at least merited some consideration in the novel, are reduced to background work here.
 
 But the idea that a relatively privileged college girl from a good home could be so casually enslaved by a plutocratic robber baroness? In America? Today? Can't touch that.
 
 
 "The Nanny Diaries." MPAA rating: PG-13 for language. Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes. In wide release.   

The rich are getting richer, but that isn't buying them much love from the movies; it may only be upping the hatred. In The Nanny Diaries , based on Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus' I was a yuppie nursemaid  chick-lit novel, Annie Braddock, a suburban New Jersey girl just out of college, falls into what is, for her, an innovative mode of delayed adulthood: She decides to spend the summer working as a nanny in New York City. Annie has vague notions of becoming an anthropologist, but beyond that she has little idea of who she wants to be. Scarlett Johansson  , with her guarded, people-pleaser softness and slightly morose carnality, plays her as a born observer, an unformed young woman who embraces her new job almost voyeuristically, as a window onto the adult world  or, at least, a certain obscenely wealthy Manhattan sector of it.
Annie gets hired to look after Grayer (Nicholas Reese Art), the spoiled but basically sweet 5-year-old son of a couple she refers to simply as ''the X's,'' who live just off Fifth Avenue in an apartment that is pure, sprawling, old-money-flavored real estate porn. Mrs. X (Laura Linney), a vainly prattling porcelain-doll narcissist, does nothing all day but shop, lunch, tend to her wall of designer shoes, and go to ''meetings'' with other social X-rays. They're mommies who don't want to be mommies  or, at least, don't want to spend more than five minutes at it, apart from fretting over which private school their tot genius is going to get into (or, in the case of culinarily correct Mrs. X, whether Grayer eats tofu or peanut butter). They treat their kids as designer accessories.
Actually, Mrs. X does one additional thing: She complains  a lot. Whatever Annie does, it's never good enough, and Mrs. X's way of addressing her simply as ''Nanny!'' is the ultimate demeaning sneer. She might be talking to a domestic robot. The Nanny Diaries  has nothing but sympathy for poor, put-upon Annie as she cleans up kiddie vomit in her upper-class prison, but it's less interested in her as a character than it is in the elite social pathology of the people she's working for. This is the same strategy that worked so well in The Devil Wears Prada , which had the daring to portray Meryl Streep's editrix monster as a figure of artfully malign fascination. Laura Linney, a great actress, with an erotic danger Streep has never possessed, could surely have done something similar, but The Nanny Diaries  turns her into a pale WASP zombie  the Stepford Bitch.
Mr. X (Paul Giamatti) is an even coarser piece of work. He's a blustery mergers hotshot, with piggy eyes that peer out from arty metal spectacles, a cell phone soldered to his ear, and a mistress he does such a bad job of hiding that it's as if he enjoys tormenting his wife. (His sadism is at least a break from his indifference.) Hooked on her husband's money, Mrs. X lives in denial, to the point that when she finds a strange negligee in the laundry, she orders the nanny to ''admit'' it's hers. Linney hints at the sadness beneath Mrs. X's waxworks existence, but it's never more than a hint.
The Nanny Diaries  was written and directed by Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini, who previously made the marvelous, lower-depths comedy American Splendor  (2003). You'd think that the filmmakers who caught the life of the squalid, lumpen crank Harvey Pekar with such transporting humanity would try to do something similar for the superrich. The movie comes on as a cheerful anthropological satire, opening with an amusing series of faux dioramas in the Museum of Natural History (they include New York types like ''Tribeca Fashionista'' and ''Park Slope Lawyer''). But Springer Berman and Pulcini embark on their anthro-expedition to the Upper East Side wielding poison daggers. Their sympathies are still with the working class  didactically so. Yes, there are wealthy New Yorkers as toxic as the X's, but by making them so one-dimensional that it threatens to strain the word dimension , The Nanny Diaries  becomes as flaccid and predictable as something you'd expect from Hollywood hacks.
What the picture keeps dancing around is that Annie, in her way, is nearly as privileged a person as the X's. She becomes so attached to Grayer that she can't leave him, but the other nannies she gets to know, most of whom are nonwhite, could scarcely afford to think of their jobs as a social ''experiment.'' The more that Annie stresses, speaking to us in her mopey voice-over, whining about the perils of home day care to the preppie dreamboat she dubs ''Harvard Hottie'' (Chris Evans), the more you want to say, ''If you don't like it, girlfriend, then quit!'' For a light comedy, The Nanny Diaries  turns out to have an off-putting theme. It glorifies the romance of slumming.

 Correction Appended  “The Nanny Diaries,” a scattershot screen adaptation of Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus’s 2002 satirical beach read, has one unassailable asset. As this exposé of the rich and miserable on the Upper East Side  wobbles along uncertainly, it rests on the tense, squared shoulders of Laura Linney. Ms. Linney defies a screenplay that paints her character, Mrs. X, a Park Avenue socialite, as a monstrous control freak. She is a smart, flexible actress who invests her role, a composite of former employers of the novel’s authors, with enough humanity to arouse some pity.  The movie, like the book, is narrated by Annie Braddock (Scarlett Johansson), a New Jersey-born anthropology student hired by Mrs. X to be the latest in a stream of nannies for her spoiled little boy, Grayer (Nicholas Reese Art). In many ways Mrs. X is as much a slave driver as Miranda Priestly, the fashion editor indelibly played by Meryl Streep in the movie version of the novel “The Devil Wears Prada.”  But Ms. Linney’s rich, high-strung snob and Ms. Streep’s chilly fashion empress are markedly different personalities. Mrs. X, for all her pretensions of grandeur, must answer to her husband (Paul Giamatti), a crude, ugly, foulmouthed boor who keeps his wife on a tight leash. (In one of his few exchanges with his son Mr. X barks to Grayer that he had better be ready to take over the world next week.) Miranda, however, calls the shots in her life. Where Ms. Linney’s Park Avenue mother can be heard screaming at her husband behind closed doors, Ms. Streep’s Miranda never, ever raises her voice.  The screen adaptations of these two chick-lit blockbusters follow the same formulaic path from naïveté to shock to disillusionment and ultimately to purification. In both stories the dutiful young acolytes become so caught up in their bosses’ horrid compulsions that their very souls are threatened; friends and family go by the wayside.  Annie lies to her mother, a nurse (Donna Murphy) who has pinched pennies to pay for her daughter’s college education, by telling her she has a trainee job on Wall Street. Her relationship with her childhood best friend (Alicia Keys) also suffers. But just before the big bad wolves — the rich and powerful — are about devour the Little Red Riding Hoods in these books, they see the light and parachute into improbably soft landings.  Because “The Nanny Diaries” is essentially a two-character story whose supporting players are wooden props, it would help if the actors playing the two were evenly matched. But Ms. Johansson’s Annie, who narrates the movie in a glum, plodding voice, is a leaden screen presence, devoid of charm and humor. With her heavy-lidded eyes and plump lips, Ms. Johansson may smolder invitingly in certain roles, but “The Nanny Diaries” is the latest in a string of films that suggest that this somnolent actress confuses sullen attitudinizing with acting.  Especially at the beginning of “The Nanny Diaries” there are signs that its directing and writing team, Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman, had a different movie in mind. The pair, who created “American Splendor,” the quirky portrait of the Cleveland comic-book writer Harvey Pekar, make amusing use of Annie’s anthropology studies. In a sequence at the American Museum of Natural History, Annie, playing tour guide, points to various social types, posed like prehistoric figures in dioramas. In a Mary Poppins-inspired fantasy, she is also shown sailing across the New York skyline under a red umbrella.  But such whimsical touches have no connection with the substance of the movie, which consists mostly of soapsuds. The storytelling is rushed and sloppy. It’s only a matter of days before the boy in Annie’s charge makes a ludicrous U-turn from hellion into little angel.  In books and movies like “The Nanny Diaries,” which play to our voyeuristic schadenfreude regarding the lives of the rich and powerful, it is essential to pile on the juicy inside details that show exactly how these people drive themselves and everyone around them crazy. Although “The Nanny Diaries” has an abundance of such details, the movie is in far too much of a hurry to take a breath and develop them into polished comic set pieces.  There is Mrs. X’s list of house rules: Grayer is encouraged to read the financial press and is directed toward all things French. (At a French-theme birthday party two Marcel Marceau-like mimes present Grayer’s birthday cake with icing that spells “bonne fête.”) Grayer’s diet (including ice cream) is to consist almost entirely of soy products. The West Side  is strictly off-limits (socially inferior), as is the subway (too many germs).  At a ghastly costume party with an American-history theme in Mr. X’s office, Annie is forced to dress like Betsy Ross. When Grayer insists on using his father’s private bathroom, Annie stumbles into Mr. X’s inner sanctum to find him canoodling with an assistant. The movie’s most biting sequence is of an obligatory mommy-nanny seminar at which cowering nannies (most from poor countries and with limited English) are encouraged to air their grievances against their employers and achieve harmony.  This rigged group-therapy session, whose facilitator wears a frozen smile and addresses the assembly in the unctuous tones of a grade-school teacher, is the only scene in the movie to hint at the rot under the charade. Nothing is allowed to disturb the fantasy of perfect moms making perfect lives for their perfect children. For an ugly, satisfying moment, the rock is lifted.  “The Nanny Diaries” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some profanity.

Taking a satirical bite out of a tightly swaddled subculture, "The Nanny Diaries" is to high-class childcare what "The Devil Wears Prada" was to high fashion. Absent Meryl Streep's indelible villainess, however, this new comedy rarely rises above standard sitcom fare, a bitter and ironic disappointment given the involvement of "American Splendor" writer-directors Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman. Built-in femme fan base indicates good opening weekend potential, but downbeat word of mouth will cause 'Diaries' to fade from view. DVD future looks brighter.
A roman a clef penned by former nannies Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus, the thunderously successful and laceratingly funny 2002 expose of spoiled Manhattan mommies helped usher in a new wave of chick lit ("Devil" provided the next big splash). Tale of an NYU child development major (dubbed simply "Nanny") and experienced babysitter caring for the son of an Upper East Side socialite ("Mrs. X") and her cheating husband ("Mr. X") is afforded a generally faithful adaptation. But given Pulcini and Berman's pedigree with the inventive, precedent-shattering "American Splendor," the movie's unexceptional nature has the net effect of an eagerly anticipated playdate torpedoed by an unruly toddler.
The bratty preschooler here is Grayer X (Nicholas Reese Art), handed off like a baton in a relay of short-lived nannies. Grayer's chance encounter with Annie Braddock (Scarlett Johansson) in Central Park prompts his mother (Laura Linney), mistaking "Annie" for "Nanny," to offer the young woman a job interview. Improbably, so does every other Chanel-clad, Bugaboo-steering mother in the vicinity. Cue the ditsy prospective employer montage.
Pulcini and Berman have implemented a few key changes: They render their protagonist a recent college grad who's headed for a future in finance until, on a whim, she decides to take the summer live-in nanny gig, a fact she keeps secret from her career-minded mother (Donna Murphy). As such, they've turned the pic into the story of a 21-year-old woman in search of herself, a move that softens its sardonic edge. Only Annie's best friend, Lynette (songstress Alicia Keys, good but underused), and Lynette's gay roommate Calvin ("Studio 60"'s Nathan Corddry, ditto) know what Annie does for a living. One element the filmmakers retain is Mr. and Mrs. X's anonymity, a choice that's initially distracting but later provides a few good laughs.
The fact that Annie, in this version, has zero nannying experience is hugely implausible, and reps a squandered comic opportunity. (In real life, upper-class moms demand sterling references, in some cases retaining private investigators to run criminal background checks on prospective employees.) But never mind: Annie takes the job with the seemingly good-hearted Mrs. X, only to discover her new boss is a control freak with little time for hands-on parental interaction but plenty of time for Madison Avenue boutiques.
Annie moves into her employers' sprawling apartment, designed to opulent perfection by Mark Ricker and his team, and shot with gleaming precision by Terry Stacey. She has fleeting encounters with Mr. X (a convincing Paul Giamatti), Grayer's work-obsessed father, who brushes off his son's embrace like lint on a suit. The fact that he's got a mistress isn't lost on Annie (nor, probably, on Mrs. X, nonetheless resolute in her displays of denial). More promising are Annie's flirtatious foyer meetings with a handsome guy she calls Harvard Hottie (Chris Evans).
Despite their rocky start, Grayer and Annie come to share a close bond. Much time is devoted to the little boy's absurdly overmanaged life, from his pre-programmed play sessions to his mother's disdain for dairy and fear of mass transit, not to mention the entire West Side. Much of this material is quite funny, but the hyperbole plays better on the page. Linney, an actress of exceptional range, has little choice but to play up the character's most obnoxious aspects, undermining the compassionate ambivalence Annie is supposed to feel for her.
Johansson, for her part, essays an engaging heroine, though even with mousy brown hair and Casual Corner wardrobe, she's far too voluptuously beautiful for the job, like a Tiffany necklace in a brown paper bag. The perfect actress for this part, alas, has aged long past it. Fifteen years ago, Julia Roberts, with her blend of sass and sympathy, would have aced the role. Though that screen incarnation remains mere fantasy, Roberts gives a pitch-perfect performance on the audiobook, which prospective audiences would be wise check out in lieu of the movie.

Shortly after graduating from film school, I took a part-time job as the assistant to a successful movie and television director who told me I'd be handling a mix of personal and professional responsibilities. Not long after, I was put to work maintaining the good humor of the tenants at said director's two multi-unit apartment buildings. I didn't learn much about filmmaking, but I came away with a veritable master's degree in property management. Was that what I signed on for? Not exactly. But even on the worst daysthe ones when I was berated for my incompetence and denied the chance to speak a single word in my defensethe thought of writing a tell-all book never crossed my mind. Boss hate, though, has become something of a literary cottage industry in recent years, with the appearance of several surprise bestsellers about the disgruntled underlings of the rich and famous (or the merely rich), most of which are so fatally predictable in their imperious bile-spewing as to make you wonder when some CEO will counter the trend with the scandalous memoir The Assistant Shows Up Late, Makes Personal Calls on Company Time, and Is Delusional Enough to Think That I Should Actually Care About Her Feelings.
It took me a good five years to catch up with The Nanny Diaries , former New York nannies Emma McLaughlin  and Nicola Kraus 's heavily publicized roman à clef about an NYU student who takes a job caring for the four-year-old son of an Upper East Side businessman (Mr. X) and his society-lady wife (Mrs. X). When I did, I found the book neither "deliciously funny" (The New York Times ) nor "impossible to put down" (Vogue  ), but rather a crudely written screed against the sinful indulgencesand poor parenting skillsof the moneyed elite, fascinating only in its frequent blurring of the line between resentment and envy. For all her self-righteous indignation at being asked to pick up Mrs. X's dry cleaning, the book's nanny (called Nanny) at least acknowledges the seductive pull of the privileged world in which she is a periodic guest star, sure as she is that she'd be a better motherand an all-around nicer personif the Manolo Blahnik  were on the other foot. (The fact that Nanny is one of the few white, college-educated workers in a field dominated by dark-skinned immigrants goes virtually unmentioned.)
The film version of The Nanny Diaries , which was written and directed by the husband-and-wife team of Shari Springer Berman  and Robert Pulcini , is a largely faithful adaptation that nevertheless manages to improve upon the source material in several key respects. Chiefly, it makes Nanny into a more appealing figure (and not just because she's played by Scarlett Johansson ), here a child-care novice rather than a seasoned pro, and possessing a markedly less odious temperament than her literary precursor (who didn't seem to like  kids very much in the first place). They've also deprived Nanny's charge, Grayer X (Nicholas Reese Art), of some of his brattier behaviors, which helps to make the story's central conceitthat Nanny sticks around (instead of going out and organizing a workers' revolution) because of her feelings for the boya lot easier to swallow on-screen than it was on the page.
But Berman and Pulcini, former documentarians who segued to features with the beautifully rendered American Splendor , can spin only so much cinematic silk from literary leather. Like the book, the Nanny Diaries  movie never finds a dramatic center, hopscotching between Nanny-Grayer bonding sessions, Nanny's flirtations with the upstairs neighbor known as Harvard Hottie (Chris Evans , who we're supposed to believe Johansson thinks is out of her league), and the Xes' gradual progression toward becoming the Exes. It's also a jumble of disparate tones, oscillating wildly from under-the-skin, Guare-like satire to screaming, over-the-top parody. For all their skill with actors (as Mrs. X, Laura Linney  does her best) and knack for filming Manhattan burnished by a radiant glow, the filmmakers don't feel nearly the same affinity for this tony uptown crowd that they did for Harvey Pekar  and his scrappy Cleveland cohorts. There, they found the soulful artist lurking beneath the crusty, curmudgeonly exterior. Here, they see only cardboard figures in an absurd landscape, right down to their comic-book obscuring of Mr. X (played, when you can see him, by Splendor 's Paul Giamatti ) behind cell phones and copies of The Wall Street Journal  .

Curiously, the most compelling (if only half-formed) idea here has less to do with class than with parentinghow parents can, out of fear or selfishness or both, abdicate the responsibility of child-rearing to self-appointed experts and Ivy League  grade schools, and how when a marriage goes south, children can become assets akin to investment accounts or property deeds. That's a rich subject for a film, but instead The Nanny Diaries  gives us a half-cocked martyr movie about a plucky prole sticking it to the corrupt bourgeoisie: Joan of (Central) Park.
