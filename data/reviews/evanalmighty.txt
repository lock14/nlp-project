The crowds may respond rapturously to this Bruce Almighty
 follow-up, but that won't be enough to turn this mild laffer into a divine comedy. Already heralded as the most expensive comedy ever made, Evan Almighty
 may need heavenly intervention to achieve ultimate financial success. Critical success is even less likely for this modern Noah-and-the-ark story that stars America's current top comic Carell, a host of live animals (in pairs), and a solid supporting cast. Freeman returns in the role of God, who commands a freshman congressional representative (who has just moved with his family from Buffalo to the suburbs of our nation's capital on a campaign promise of "changing the world") to build an ark. Even though God professes to be a big believer in the "one random act of kindness" approach to changing the world, he nevertheless instructs Rep. Evan Baxter (Carell) to build a humongous ark in his back yard (and the seven neighboring empty lots). This time-consuming project, of course, interferes with Baxter's legislative duties, which is just as well since he is about to become the innocent stooge of a boondoggling, corrupt politician (Goodman). There are shades of Hitchcock as flocks of birds begin following him, but they do nothing more menacing than perch on his limbs and scatter droppings as though they were bona fide punch lines. Shadyac, who also directed Bruce Almighty
 with Jim Carrey, is an old pro when it comes to ignoring the old Hollywood adage about never working with animals, as he also helmed Carrey's breakout film, Ace Ventura: Pet Detective
. As in The 40 Year Old Virgin
, Carell's hair becomes another set-piece as the modern Noah's hair and beard grow uncontrollably long. (Thank goodness the film leaves out the part of the Noah story in which he becomes drunk and appears naked before his three sons.) Most disconcerting, however, is the opening sequence, which opens the film on a false note. We're shown the final broadcast of Buffalo TV news anchor Baxter before he departs for his new job in Washington. Yet any media outlet would be bound by standards of ethical and equal-time practices to ask for the candidate's resignation immediately after announcing his intention to run for office. Call it a personal peeve, but it's really just one in a long series of bland jokes and lazy contrivances that make up the world of Evan Almighty
.


When Morgan Freeman prevails upon me to, say, part the border fence and let the illegal immigrants go, I hope that assignment proves more compelling than watching Steve Carell build an ark in "Evan Almighty ." This wimpy family comedy tries, half-heartedly, to fuse the planet's ecological woes with much of the country's religious convictions, while taking broad swipes at legislative malfeasance in the Capitol. If that combination sounds remotely enticing, wait for the "South Park " episode that would do it justice.
In the meantime, this is a harmless excuse to watch cute critters (from farm, forest, and jungle) harass Carell as he reprises an expanded version of a minor but funny role he played 
in "Bruce Almighty ," that Jim Carrey smash from 2003. In those four years, the American film comedy landscape has changed significantly. Carrey, who even then seemed desperate for darker movies, has all but renounced gangbusters slapstick, and Carell, while being a very different sort of actor (his m.o. is internal combustion), now seems the brighter star.
Only in the last 30 minutes does "Evan Almighty" put his gifts to decent use. Epically hairy and biblically robed, Carell suggests at that point what a bolder, more psychologically serious treatment of religious conviction would have been like. Until then he seems like Paul Lynde freaking out in a high-concept kiddie comedy from the 1970s.
When his character, Evan Baxter , is elected to Congress, he quits his news anchor job and moves his wife (Lauren Graham , languishing in a long-suffering-wife role) and their three sons from Buffalo into an exurban Virginia McMansion overlooking an expanse of barren lots. On the eve of his first day in office, he prays for help in changing the world. Changing Tom Shadyac's mercilessly broad direction would have been more useful. Most of the gags are underscored by grubby close-ups. One shot pulls in tight for a movie theater whose marquee reads "The 40-Year-Old Virgin Mary " (har har). The filmmaking is the equivalent of large type.
After seeing the numbers 6:14 wherever he goes (a nod to that fateful passage in Genesis), Evan receives a visit from God, who's still played by the supremely mellow Freeman. For days, He's been having lumber and tools dropped off outside Evan's house. Animals have been following him in twos to his roomy office (birds of all feathers flock over him like storm clouds that rain poop) and, as an interesting companion development to Carell's chest-waxing sequence in "The 40-Year-Old Virgin ," Evan's hair refuses to stop growing. Indeed, God wants this man to be his Noah and build an ark in preparation for a Great Flood.
But Freeman's is not a wrathful Lord. Frankly, his unflappable incarnation wouldn't be out of place in a Cheech and Chong movie. Most of the story's energy is spent building to Evan's showdown with John Goodman , as a crooked senior congressman who wants Evan to co-sponsor a shady land-use bill. No one's party affiliation ever comes up, but apparently God wants more church in His state. Shockingly, this flood is less an allergic reaction to any global catastrophe and more the result of what happens when a studio has too much cash to blow on a wild effects sequence.
Actually, at a rumored $175 million, the movie tops "Waterworld " as the most expensive aquatic comedy ever made. The resulting merits of such an achievement are debatable. (Is a big budget like a musical score: best undetected?) Hopefully a lot of that money went to Wanda Sykes , who plays one of Evan's staffers. It's a huge relief to see that in a movie full of critters, Sykes, for once, is playing a human. She wins most of the movie's laughs tossing barbs at anyone she can. When Carell comes to work with a beard and mane, one of her Teflon putdowns is, "You look like a Bee Gee."
She's the riskiest, sharpest thing in a movie that strives to be all things to all people. That might work for God and certain politicians, but it's a monotonous approach to comedy.


         MOVIESSteve Carell is lovable as God's unwilling disciple. But the comedy is less than divine.God may be in all things, but lately he seems especially at home in a certain kind of big-budget studio comedy aimed at a very particular market. That would be, apparently, the market that loves its zingy Bible puns and its adorable CGI versions of all God's creatures but doesn't want to be made to feel too 
bad about driving that SUV or heating 6,000 square feet in a just-sprouted development.
 
 In Tom Shadyac's "Evan Almighty," as in its predecessor, "Bruce Almighty," the supreme being spends a lot of time adjusting the attitudes of middle-class everymen who have strayed from the path of righteousness. Not that they've strayed very far, mind you — the God of studio comedies is not really all that judgmental, preferring to overlook the lighter, middle-class sins so as not to alienate his core fan base.
 


         






   Here, he's once again portrayed by Morgan Freeman as one part groovy yoga instructor, one part Vegas magician and one part high-end New Age life coach in Deepak Chopra pajamas. No part of him, however, suggests the Old Testament deity who, upon deciding that his creation is a big, fat disappointment, wipes it out and starts all over again. A God that vengeful and cranky may be OK for the Bible, but nobody expects him to carry a $175-million movie.
 
 The eminently lovable Steve Carell, on the other hand, is just the man for that 
job, no matter how schmucky the character. Carell plays Evan, the preening, buffoonish Buffalo, N.Y., anchorman despised by Bruce in the first movie. He's just been elected to Congress on the "change the world" ticket, and the movie gets going as he piles his family — wife Joan ("Gilmore Girls' " Lauren Graham, minus her personality) and three standard-issue movie sons — into a shiny new Hummer. No sooner has he settled into his new northern Virginia home, a day-old McMansion  (with kitchen counters lined with old-growth Brazilian cherrywood) in the brand-new development of Prestige Crest, than Evan starts receiving divine hints (a Bible verse on the clock radio, a crate of antediluvian tools on the doorstep and a pallet of lumber on the lawn). Then God shows up and orders a custom boat.
 
 When Evan arrives on Capitol Hill for his first day on the job, having been inexplicably trailed by incontinent wildlife throughout the commute, Evan finds that Congressman Long (John Goodman) has installed him and his team — campaign manager Marty (John Michael Higgins), assistant Rita (Wanda Sykes) and intern Eugene (Jonah Hill) — in a suspiciously luxurious office and is angling for Evan's support on what is clearly a shady land-grab bill. Nobody suspects a thing.
 
 What might follow, if the script didn't feel like it had been written over a weekend with a book of bad Bible puns in hand, would be some kind of ethical quandary: Should Evan advance his political career or do the right thing by opposing the bill? How will his beliefs be transformed?
 
 Instead, Evan tries to go about his business as usual while God strong-arms him into a do-it-yourself project by turning him into Dr. Dolittle and afflicting him with a bad case of hyper-hirsutism. It's not so much a test of faith as a test of endurance. His hair and beard grow uncontrollably. Suits fly off him to be replaced by sackcloth robes. Lordy, how much bird poop can Evan withstand before caving?
 
 It would help if we had any idea what Evan is supposed to be converting to. Will he renounce the suburban assault vehicle and the neo-Colonial ego monument, buy a Prius and settle into a more modest, say, 1,200 square feet of solar-paneled eco-living? Well, no. Will he sponsor bills to abolish the teaching of evolution in schools? Not that either.
 
  He will, however, adopt a stray dog. And not just any dog. A dog that went potty on his lawn! This, God tells him, is what it's all about. Clearly, the God of "Evan Almighty" is a loving God, a forgiving God, a God who knows better than to discuss politics or religion at the box office, a God with unbelievably low expectations of humanity.
 
 So what, then, is with the very impressive computer-generated wall of water that arrives as promised? That would be a public reprimand to the bad guy whose comeuppance is nigh. Though, given the limited scope of destruction, it's unclear why rhinos and elephants are called upon to board the ship. Then again, there's so much that doesn't make sense in "Evan Almighty" that the issue of wherefore the African fauna feels like a quibble. On the one hand, it's a thoroughly hedged pro-environment message. On the other, it's a Christian parable without an ethical center or moral lesson — it's zeitgeisty!
 
 Nobody plays the humiliated, put-upon putz like Carell, however, so while it's disappointing to see him stuck in a soulless widget like this one, it's better than not seeing him at all. Sadder to see the brilliant Jon Stewart as himself, only not funny, making fake "Daily Show" jokes about the "New York Noah." It falls to Sykes, as ever, to be the designated zinger dispenser, while Graham is relegated to the blandest, most thankless of roles. (What is it with comedy writers and wives?)
 
 Whatever its faults, "Bruce Almighty" sprung from a single, elegant premise that it followed through to the end: What if an average guy was given God-like powers? Jim Carrey played a local TV news correspondent whose frustration with God resulted in the Almighty teaching him a lesson similar to the one he imparted unto Spider-Man. Bruce was granted omnipotence (conveniently set to a Snap! track), and with it, intimate knowledge of what a pain noblesse oblige can be. Beyond a massive piece of Steve Carell business, however, "Evan Almighty" hasn't quite decided what it wants to be, and you get the feeling that if it weren't for another amazing arc — Carell's recent career trajectory — it wouldn't exist at all.
 
 
 "Evan Almighty." MPAA rating: PG for mild rude humor and some peril. Running time: 1 hour, 30 minutes. In general release.   

And it came to pass that a Voice with the celestial intonation of Morgan Freeman came to Steve Carell and said, ''Comedy superstar!'' And Carell said, ''Who, me?'' And the Voice said, ''I am the God of Abraham, of Isaac, of Bruce, and of sequels!'' And Carell said, ''I gave at The Office .''
But the Voice continued: ''It is time! I want you to star in Evan Almighty , where you will play Evan Baxter, the character you were back in 2003 when you took a small role in Bruce Almighty  as a babbling newscaster and stole the show from Jim Carrey. I want you to play the same Evan, only this time you've been elected to Congress, and you've moved into a fancy, wasteful house where you don't pay enough attention to your wife and three sons, and so God  played by Morgan Freeman, of course  comes to you and says he wants you to build an Ark! And thus will you learn about humility, family togetherness, prayer, acts of random kindness, and ecological integrity. And lo, you will please the faith-based community and attract your own comedy congregants, too, and it will be good! Or at least profitable.''
And Carell said, ''Riiight ,'' although not quite like Bill Cosby said it four decades earlier in his own famous comedy skit about Noah and the Ark, the one where God went on about cubits and stuff. But because he is a decent fellow, and a smart man, Carell made good on the prophecy, starring in a movie not so much divinely inspired as nailed together by blunt force using splintered two-by-fours. When the star gets the chance to be the Evan Baxter beloved in the first Almighty  production  a shallow, self-involved media twit, a blow-dried blowhard  Carell is, well, a god. Nobody tackles a scene in which a vain man attends to his own nose hairs with more gusto.
When he goes all biblical, though, the tide goes against him, and against any chances of honest comedy charm. (Tom Shadyac directs and Steve Oedekerk writes, as they did on the first.) In the beginning, Evan is understandably miffed by God's work order, especially since the freshman representative is about to get a power boost from an alliance with a sleazy, environment-destroying congressman (played by John Goodman with the full force of corruption propelling his ample flesh). God insists, though, plying Evan with fewer and fewer wardrobe choices and more and more Old Testament hair  a reasonably funny setup, especially for a man obsessed with nose hair.
It's when Noah sees the light, and he and his family begin working in harmony, that the story takes on water. Although Wanda Sykes, as Evan's executive assistant, and Ed Helms, as (what else?) a preening yutz of a TV reporter, do what they can to keep the edges sharp, nothing can offset the picture's dutiful Sunday-school intentions or the generic qualities of the CG animals that follow Noah in twosies. The message is so good-hearted, so inarguable, so dull. And here's the punchline: Turns out that ARK stands for Acts of Random Kindness. Riiiight .


 “Evan Almighty,” in which Steve Carell, playing a newly elected congressman from Buffalo, is commanded by God (Morgan Freeman) to build an ark, is a movie far less interesting than its premise. It is also slightly less interesting than its hugely popular predecessor, “Bruce Almighty,” which starred Jim Carrey. But there is nonetheless a fruitful franchise in the making here, a potentially endless series of movies with popular, sometimes naughty comedians acting out wholesome modern-day versions of well-known Bible stories.  Think of the possibilities: In “Stan Almighty,” Mr. Freeman tells Sacha Baron Cohen to kill off one of his kids (whichever Breslin, Culkin or Fanning is furthest from puberty); in “Doug Almighty,” Will Ferrell is swallowed by a computer-generated whale; and in “Jane Almighty,” a virginal Sarah Silverman finds herself pregnant with Mr. Freeman’s child. Eventually, Dave Chappelle will fight the battle of Jericho and the culture wars will have officially ended.  Meanwhile we can ponder the lessons of “Evan Almighty,” which combines bland religiosity and timid environmentalism into a soothing Sunday-school homily about the importance of being nice. As I understand it, the God of the Old Testament is a pretty tough deity, but it is not in Mr. Freeman’s nature to be wrathful or jealous. His God is more a practical joker than a smiter, and his intervention in human affairs (and in the American legislative process) more therapeutic than punitive.  At first, Evan is a twitchy, gung-ho careerist — for some reason, Mr. Carell seems to be trying out a Greg Kinnear impersonation — who drives a Hummer, neglects his family and falls under the unsavory sway of a corrupt committee chairman (John Goodman). Then the Lord appears, followed by truckloads of wood (funny, I always thought hickory barky barky was the traditional ark-building material) and hundreds of animals. The birds relieve themselves first on Mr. Carell, then on Mr. Goodman, who is also spat upon by an alpaca.  Both men retain their good humor. Lauren Graham, who plays Evan’s wife, Joan (get it?), has a harder time finding anything amusing to do, and the couple’s three sons (Johnny Simmons, Graham Phillips and Jimmy Bennett) barely register. A gaggle of gifted comic actors — Wanda Sykes, Molly Shannon, Jonah Hill — read their lines and cash their checks, and Jon Stewart has a cameo.  Mr. Carell, once again, encounters some hair-removal issues. Otherwise, most of the humor consists of cute biblical references (Ms. Shannon’s character is a real estate agent named Eve Adams), carpentry slapstick (Mr. Carell smites his thumb with a hammer or falls off a beam) and animal gags. There is not much in the way of wit, emotional complication or suspense, and as Evan’s initial skepticism turns to righteousness he seems to fall into a trance. If you feel yourself doing the same, chances are it is the result of boredom, not beatitude.  “Evan Almighty” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some mildly naughty humor, but nowhere near as much sex or violence as the Book of Genesis.

The problems with "Evan Almighty" mostly boil down to questions of scale. The movie warns of an imminent flood, yet delivers only sprinkles of laughter or anything approaching magic. It's mildly diverting for kids and families in a way that would be perfectly fine as an ABC Family cable project (perhaps before "The 700 Club"), but sails into the summer anchored to all the baggage and expectations a comedy with an enormous budget invites. Universal has courted church groups and will need them to line up, two by two and then some, to fully recoup on their epic investment.
Although ostensibly plucked from the ribs of "Bruce Almighty," the 2003 comedy hit starring Jim Carrey, "Evan" plays much more like an uncredited sequel to "Oh, God!" garnished with a dollop of "The Santa Clause." The film also reaffirms, for anyone who doubted it, Steve Carell's arrival as a major comedy presence and asset to NBC Universal (featuring him in "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and NBC's Emmy-winning "The Office"), and his own appeal surpasses that of the movie itself.
Carell -- reprising his role, but going from supporting to lead -- and Morgan Freeman as God are the only onscreen ties to "Bruce," though director Tom Shadyac and writer Steve Oedekerk are also back on board. Even so, the narrative immediately shifts venue, jettisoning Evan from his status as a TV anchorman and into a newly won congressional seat. (Not to nitpick, but nobody would be allowed to anchor the news during a campaign and right up until being sworn in, as the movie suggests.)
Loading up the Hummer, Evan, his wife ("Gilmore Girls' " Lauren Graham, in an especially thankless spousal role) and their three sons zip off to Washington, where she prays for a closer-knit family and he -- while not the praying type -- puts in a divine plea for help with his "change the world" campaign theme.
Yet just as Evan begins to navigate his way around D.C. and earn the patronage of a powerful congressional ally (John Goodman), none other than God appears, not-so-gently prodding him to build an ark.
It's around here where one can see the dollar signs start to pile up, as animals of all kinds (invariably in pairs) begin following Evan around, eager to book their passage on the great big boat. Meanwhile, his rapid hair growth and wardrobe change to a flowing robe render him an object of widespread ridicule (former "Daily Show" chums Jon Stewart and Ed Helms join in the mockery), testing both Evan's faith and that of his family in him.
Despite its unabashed spiritual overtones (seemingly augmented at every conceivable moment by John Debney's relentlessly grandiose score), "Evan Almighty" also weaves in an environmental message, either shrewdly or cynically designed to have it both ways. Pic entices religious conservatives -- who tend to dismiss Hollywood as a den of iniquity -- with talk of God and nothing racier than bird-poop gags, while still stroking the political left with a "save the planet" message.
Beyond the cute animals and considerable technical effort expended to make their integration generally seamless, Shadyac has wisely populated his human roles with big, brassy comedic personalities like John Michael Higgins, Wanda Sykes and Jonah Hill as Evan's congres-sional aides, who can wring maximum yuks from the minimal material. That said, the sheer number of musical montages and repetitive prat-falls suggests the movie is laboring to stay afloat through feature length, and the special effects during the climactic sequence are at best uneven.
"Evan Almighty" is useful in one broader respect, reminding cultural warriors that hedonistic Hollywood has no qualms about promoting religion if it can visualize a wide swatch of green at the rainbow's end. As for whether reaching out to that traditionally elusive market sweet-ens Universal's pot on this slight but expensive confection, well, Evan surely won't be the only one muttering a little prayer. 


Evan Almighty  is the work of an angry God. A sanctimonious sitcom dolled up as the most expensive comedy ever made $175 mil, so they say, no doubt chokingit marks an unfortunate low point in the history of recent American comedy. There goes Steve Carell 's perfect game.
In short, God (Morgan Freeman , who you know is God because his white linen shirts never wrinkle) tells Evan, an anchor-turned-politician, that if he builds it, they will come"it" being an ark, "they" being animals lined up two by two. The movie suggests, quite frankly, that God's nothing more than a son of a bitch who's willing to drown thousands of people just to prove that one characterand you'll know who, like, 12 minutes inis up to no good. Rather than use Evan as a vessel to warn innocent people about impending disaster, God turns the poor guy into a Rogaine  freak show with a messianic complex toward whom elephants and monkeys migrate.
And why does God choose Evan? Because he was played in the original, Bruce Almighty , by Steve Carell, on a roll till now with The Office  and The 40-Year-Old Virgin , in which the former Daily Show   correspondent proved he was willing to debase himself for a well-deserved laugh. Who better to build a sequel around than an actor for whom self-humiliation is considered an act of heroism?
Evan Almighty  actually stoops, repeatedly, to remind you how much you like Carell. There's a movie marquee advertising The 40-Year-Old Virgin Mary  , and the camera actually lingers on it for several seconds. Jon Stewart  appears twice from the Daily Show  set, poking fun at Evan's transformation from suit-and-tie politician into robed messiah. (In the film's holier-than-thou context, Stewart comes off like a godless heathen, which, blessedly, he is.) And several of Carell's Office  and Virgin  cast mates make small cameos. Sweet Lord, how they all tryto no avail. This is PG-rated proselytizing tinged with Al Gore  self-righteousness, all with the narrative thrust of a film about the apocalypse starring Kirk Cameron .
