You might not know Ray McKinnon�s name, but you probably know his face: as a serial killer from a later episode of The X-Files
, as the Reverend H.W. Smith on Deadwood
, as the unfortunate hayseed who courts Holly Hunter in O Brother, Where Art Thou?
 He�s the go-to guy when Hollywood needs a profligate or weird-looking Southerner. He�s also the director, writer, and co-star of this oddly pitched but wholly memorable drama set in the Arkansas Ozarks. Dare I suggest that when three of a film�s stars are also its producers � and not the Weinstein brothers or Tim Bevan � then what you have is honest-to-peaches independent cinema, and it�s not always pretty? Chrystal
 is not a pretty film, even though it begins with the most ingeniously lit opening shot in recent memory, and Adam Kimmel�s fluid cinematography immerses the busted, rusted rural landscape in verdant languor. Moments of the film are sublime to see and hear � Stephen Trask�s original score bookends some stunning selections of mountain music, as well as songs performed by Harry Dean Stanton and co-star Blount (an Arkansas native who has an eerie, jagged singing voice) � but the characters struggle with a hardscrabble existence. Chrystal (Blount) is a mother left childless years ago when her drug-running husband, Joe (Thornton), ran their car off a two-lane highway during a police chase, killing their four-year-old son and leaving her with a broken neck that still pains her. Joe returns from prison to find Chrystal still living in their house but barely speaking to him (indeed, the film�s first several scenes have no dialogue at all); she�s a hollowed-out shell of a woman. Joe makes a bed on the front porch and begins working to regain her trust, but chance threatens to draw him back in to a life of crime. The film isn�t seamless, and its last act reaches for epic gravity on a Shakespearean scale (with Thornton as a sort of backwoods King Lear), exceeding its grasp. Better is the slow build of the first half, which finds Thornton taciturn and almost painfully restrained � a quiet man burdened by his secrets � and gives generously to Blount. Hers is the showy role: the physically infirm and psychologically fragile wife stopped in time at the moment her child died. Blount�s performance is so brave it�s awkward to watch at times, uncomfortably open. The tone of the film teeters between gut-wrenching realism and grand, operatic fatalism. It�s a tricky balancing act, perhaps even a questionable and ill-advised one. (One gimmick used to move the plot along, involving a pair of traveling musicologists, is totally unnecessary.) But this is the kind of film you want to praise for what it attempts to accomplish, even if its success is mixed. Even at its most contrived, the filmmakers believe in this project so passionately that its atmosphere seems absolutely real.

         An ode to the oral tradition of the Middle East, "The Keeper: The Legend of Omar Khayyam" is efficiently told by first-time writer-director Kayvan Mashayekh and melds the contemporary world with the historic. The family-friendly epic weaves the touching story of a young boy living with his Iranian immigrant family in Houston and the tale of the 11th century mathematician, astronomer and poet, Omar Khayyam.
 
  The boy, Kamran (Adam Echahly), sits patiently by the bedside of his dying older brother Nader (Puya Behinaein) who carefully relates the adventures of Khayyam as their grandfather and his ancestors had done before him. Omar (Bruno Lastra) is a brilliant young man involved in a "Jules and Jim"-like triangle with the beautiful slave girl Darya (Marie Espinosa) and the fiercely devout Hassan Sabbeh (Christopher Simpson), who goes on to create the sect of the Assassins. Called to work in the court of the Sultan Malikshah (Moritz Bliebtreu), Omar becomes one of the great minds of his age as he struggles to remain above the political and religious upheaval. Inspired by the tale, Kamran is propelled on a quest to discover more about the author of the Rubiayat.
 


         






    Shot primarily in Uzbekistan, the film boasts strong production values and an international cast that includes Vanessa Redgrave and Diane Baker. There is nothing extraordinary about the filmmaking, but Mashayekh's old-fashioned commitment to his and co-writer Belle Avery's story creates an overall satisfying experience.

 A bloodbath that twists expectations
 
 
Alexandre Aja's "High Tension" is an efficiently made French thriller — extensively dubbed for accessibility and aimed at audiences with a taste for films of extreme violence. The MPAA has given a trimmed version of this grisly bloodbath an R rating, but it still raises the question: When it comes to the depiction of graphic grisliness and gore, for what is the MPAA saving the NC-17? For much of its duration the film is a case of intense fare done with an undeniable effectiveness and ingenuity — until it lurches into a deplorable surprise twist. (What that is will not be revealed here.)
 
  The film follows a savage, burly, middle-aged madman (Philippe Nahon, of Gaspar Noe's "I Stand Alone") who slaughters a husband and wife and small child in their rural home in the south of France and kidnaps their teenage daughter Alex (Maïwenn). Marie (Cécile de France), a visiting friend and classmate, bravely attempts to rescue Alex from the killer's clutches. But things are not what they seem. The killer turns out to be a stereotype that is no less offensive because it is the stalest of cliches.
 
 "High Tension," 
(1 hour, 25 minutes) Rated R, for graphic bloody killings, terror, sexual content and language. In general release.
 
 Bowling is back with a big heart
 
 
In his engaging documentary "A League of Ordinary Gentlemen" Christopher Browne makes bowling exciting and its stars involving as he follows the 2003 Professional Bowlers Assn. nationwide tour, culminating in a tense world championship showdown in Detroit. By 1997, when ABC stopped televising the PBA competitions, professional bowling was nearly extinct and bowling itself long past its peak popularity as a family pastime. However, in 2000, three former Microsoft executives purchased the PBA for $5 million, and hired Chief Executive Officer Steve Miller, a smart, blunt ex-football player and former Nike global marketing head to revive the PBA by making it more colorful and media friendly.
 
  Miller is a tough guy with a clutch of right ideas, which even the film's four professional bowling subjects acknowledge, albeit grudgingly. The flamboyant style of pugnacious, wiry Pete Weber is exactly to Miller's taste, but the others are not so neat a fit. Walter Ray Williams Jr. is a tall, imposing man with a low-key style and manner; Chris Barnes is a talented, clean-cut young man given to mood swings; and Wayne Webb, like Weber and Williams, is a middle-age veteran — but unlike them he has a past strewn with broken marriages and bankruptcies; this tour will make or break his career as a professional bowler. Circumstances have forced Webb to reflect more deeply upon his life than the others, and he becomes the heart of this informativeand endearing film.
 
 "A League of Ordinary Gentlemen," 
Unrated. Suitable family fare but a few blunt words. 1 hour, 38 minutes. At Regent Showcase, 614 N. La Brea Ave., (323) 934-2944.
 
 Ex-con must pick up life's leftovers
 
 
Filmmaker Ray McKinnon, an Academy Award winner for best live action short in 2002, makes a stirring feature directing debut with the Southern gothic drama "Chrystal." Billy Bob Thornton plays Joe, a former pot farmer, returning home after 20 years in prison, the consequence of a car accident during police pursuit on drug charges that left his young son dead and his wife, Chrystal, (Lisa Blount) maimed — physically and emotionally.
 
  Thornton and Blount are excellent, wearing frozen masks of hurt as they do a slow dance of redemption. McKinnon adds some comic sadism playing a local drug lord named Snake, and Stephen Trask's original music and the roots-oriented song score compliment the rusted out surroundings of the Ozark mountain town where the film takes place. "Chrystal" unravels a bit toward the end as it becomes more fable-like, but the performances make it worthwhile.
 
 "Chrystal," 
R for sexuality, nudity, drug content, violence and language. Running time: 1 hour, 46 minutes. Exclusively at Laemmle's Sunset 5, 8000 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood, (323) 848-3500.
 
 One man's inner revolution
 
 
Karen Shakhnazarov's handsome "The Rider Named Death" is not the film one might have expected from an adaptation of a 1909 novel by Boris Savinkov (1879-1925), who became a leader of the Combat Organization, the terrorist faction of Russia's Socialist-Revolutionary Party, whose bombings and assassinations of high government officials in the early 20th century paved the way for the Russian Revolution.
 
  Shakhnazarov eschews suspense, passion and intrigue for a highly contemplative portrait of a reflective, coldly detached man, Georges (Andrey Panin), clearly Savinkov's alter ego, who in the course of the film acknowledges that though he may kill for an idea or a principle, his fundamental motive is that he simply wants to. He has come to see civilization as a sham and to regard people as savages driven by a desire for revenge. This means that "The Rider Named Death" is so low-key as to skirt tedium but does subtly manage to accrue a certain cumulative effect.
 
  "The Rider Named Death" takes place mostly on a large set re-creating a section of Moscow at the turn of the last century, which means much of the action is confined to the same settings, creating an unfortunate repetitiveness. The force of the film is not as profound as Shakhnazarov clearly intended, and "The Rider Named Death" is easier to respect than enjoy.
 
 "The Rider Named Death,"
 unrated. Some violence, adult scenes. 1 hour, 46 minutes. At the New Beverly Cinema, 7165 W. Beverly Blvd.   


Like a distinctively Southern piece of literature, "Chrystal" is a story of family tragedy and afflicted characters in desperate need of redemption. Nicely put together by the husband-and-wife team of writer-producer-director Ray McKinnon and producer-star Lisa Blount, whose 2001 short "The Accountant" won an Oscar, pic tells in measured fashion the peculiar tale of an emotionally scarred couple's cautious reunion two decades after a traumatic event. Respectable piece of work is reasonably involving if not compelling, and has an outside chance at a little theatrical headway based on Billy Bob Thornton's name, especially in the South, before securing a niche in cable and ancillary markets. 
Striking opening, shot from high overhead, shows two vehicles, one a cop car with lights flashing, streaking through the night. After the lead car crashes, we are left with the haunting image of a little boy standing in the headlights in the woods and finally walking away, as his badly injured mother lies hanging out the windshield.
Twenty years later, the mother, Chrystal (Blount), is taking on all comers in the back seat of a car. When she returns to her farm in the Arkansas Ozarks, who should turn up unannounced but her husband Joe (Thornton), who's been in prison all this time. They say little to each other as the meek, wary Joe quietly takes up residence on the porch with the dog and begins doing odd jobs around the property. Chrystal, who moves slowly and stiffly due to pain from the old accident, watches him and slips him food outside.
Lording it over the area is aptly named dope dealer Snake (a very slimy McKinnon), the modern-day equivalent of a moonshine bootlegger who pressures Joe to grow marijuana for him on his property. After a big and oddly fought public fistfight, it's clear nothing good can result between these two, but there's much that will happen before the long arc of this drama plays itself out.
Slowly, Chrystal and Joe begin to communicate. Although she tells him that, "You poison everything you touch," she has always loved Joe, a bad decision her nosy mother (Grace Zabriskie) blames on her daughter's having read too much "Tennessee Wilson and Truman Capote" in her youth. For his part, Joe, who's putting his welding skills to use creating an enormous free-form metal sculpture in the yard, just wants his wife to tell him what to do.
A subplot that seems extraneous on paper but becomes intriguing is the visit to the area by a blind musicologist, Kalid (Harry Lennix), who's writing a book on mountain music and wants to track down local legend Pa Da (Harry Dean Stanton). Chrystal's own singing impresses Kalid, leading to a tentative emotional connection between the urban black man and hillbilly white woman with potential to go further were it not for Chrystal's lingering issues with Joe.
Most Southern Gothic touch involves Chrystal's belief that the pain in her neck is the manifestation of her dead son, who we have come to understand was killed in the car crash. The eternal grief and longing she feels for her boy, coupled with Joe's culpability for his death, provides the primal emotional force behind the drama, one that resolves itself in effective fashion after the more overt and violent melodrama involving Snake has come and gone.
Salvation more in personal than religious terms is the overriding concern of McKinnon's thorough but generally understated script. Traditionally told yarn is well built, with special attention given to the main character's deep motivations and paradoxical natures.
Working in his most subdued mode, Thornton effectively puts across a man who knows he will never escape the consequences of his past mistakes but just might be capable of providing some release for Chrystal after all the pain he's caused her. Chrystal's resolute steadfastness makes the character a bit monotonous at prolonged exposure, but Blount clearly expresses her fundamental nature and deep torments. Secondary cast lends colorful support.
Shot around Eureka Springs, Ark., pic evinces a strong sense of place. Tech qualities are solid, and musical elements add significant flavors.
