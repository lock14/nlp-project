In this surprisingly fresh handling of indie quirk, an unstable, jazz-musician father (Michael Douglas) enlists his long-suffering,teenage daughter (Evan Rachel Wood) in a search for Spanish gold buried under a banal Costco. Much of the fizz in King of California , writer-director Mike Cahill's feature debut about the thin line between California dreamin' and real mental illness, comes from a liberated Douglas  loose, hairy, and having a blast  as the Don Quixote dad. It's as if the star finally gets to integrate all his onscreen personas, all at once.

 It is tempting to think of “King of California,” a serious comedy that does many things right, as a sequel of sorts to “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.” In Mike Cahill’s breezy, loose-jointed independent film, Michael Douglas, who produced “Cuckoo’s Nest,” kicks over the traces to play a man not unlike Randle Patrick McMurphy in the earlier film.  To be sure, Mr. Douglas’s character, Charlie, appears considerably loonier than McMurphy, the charismatic, possibly sociopathic rebel in a mental institution so fiercely embodied by Jack Nicholson. A wild-haired, wild-eyed dreamer discharged from a county institution in Southern California after two years and now on a half-mad quest for buried treasure, Charlie might be described as crazy-sane, with the emphasis tilting toward crazy.  The movie, narrated by Charlie’s mildly exasperated but forgiving 16-year-old daughter, Miranda (Evan Rachel Wood), champions the free spirit that blazes in his deranged mind with the same fervor with which  “Cuckoo’s Nest” applauded McMurphy’s maniacal fight against authority.  The forces of oppression, instead of being distilled into a single authoritarian enemy like Nurse Ratched, are spread out. Everywhere Charlie goes in his search, he is interrupted and questioned by the police and security guards. The Southern California environment itself, where orange groves give way to strip malls, is portrayed as spiritually suffocating.  But Charlie, riding the manic phase of a bipolar cycle, is virtually oblivious to anyone standing in his way. When a policewoman accosts him while he is digging on private property, he flirts with her and slips her his phone number.  Mr. Douglas, giving his strongest screen performance since “Wonder Boys,” creates a portrait of a fanatic on a tear that is at once endearing and maddening, and not overplayed. Charlie’s quest is only the latest in a series of offbeat schemes in which he hopes to prove to himself and his daughter that he can amount to something on his own eccentric terms. An amateur musician, he plays the stand-up bass, and in the movie’s most poignant vignette he tells his daughter of the time he pawned his instrument and lost hope until he was able to retrieve it.  The treasure in question is a chest of gold doubloons supposedly buried in the area by a 17th-century Spanish explorer whose journals Charlie studied while institutionalized. He is convinced he cracked a secret code in the journals that will lead him directly to the treasure. Armed with a metal detector and an old map, he undertakes the quest, which eventually leads him to a Costco where he imagines he has pinpointed the cache buried six feet under the concrete floor. Still undeterred, he determines to get it.  At his behest, Miranda, who has been working double shifts at a McDonald’s, gets a job in the store as clerk, researches its security system and even steals a master key. Gathering sophisticated surveyor’s tools and digging equipment, Charlie organizes a late-night break-in with Miranda as his assistant and Pepper (Willis Burks II), a former member of his defunct jazz combo, playing lookout.  Not the least of the story’s many holes is Charlie’s overnight acquisition of such expensive equipment, but no matter. “King of California” may look and feel realistic, but it is really a Don Quixote-like fable about nonconformity and pursuing your impossible dream to the very end.  Miranda, for all the wretched parenting she has endured, trusts her crazy father’s visionary purity. A poised, resourceful girl who has bamboozled each of several child welfare agencies into thinking she is being supervised by one or the other, she begins to believe her father’s fantasies may not be pie-in-the-sky.  As parent-teenager stories go, “King of California” runs pointedly against the grain. The exact opposite of Ms. Wood’s character in “Thirteen,” Miranda doesn’t run wild. She is the responsible one, but on her own terms. The child is caretaker to the parent, who may be mad but who is also a holy fool, and holy fools are worth protecting.  “King of California” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

Bristling with a beard and a madman's joie de vivre
, Michael Douglas brings as much twisted personality to "King of California" as he has to anything since "Wall Street" -- which should help make this Mike Cahill-helmed and written, cockeyed comedy a solid hit among the adult and the adult-minded. The only thing dragging down Cahill's Don Quixote-on-the-West Coast fable -- which boasts an eccentric tone, properly whimsical music and problematic father-daughter story -- is the daughter, Evan Rachel Wood, who flatlines through most of the movie. Douglas, however, is a manic joy, and Wood manages to hang on for the ride. 
 Produced by the "Sideways" team of Alexander Payne and Michael London, "King of California" is far broader and plot-driven than that earlier Payne-helmed film, but taps into a similarly sophisticated sensibility. The characters are fractured -- Charlie (Douglas) is an intermittent mental patient who is leaving a county facility at the outset of the film; Miranda (Wood) is his long-suffering daughter, abandoned by her mother and working at McDonald's.
As if Miranda didn't have enough problems, her faux-Prospero father decides the long-lost treasure of a 17th Century Spanish adventurer is hidden near their ramshackle suburban home. Armed with various tools of the prospecting trade -- a map, books, a shovel and, eventually, a backhoe and a scuba-diving suit -- Charlie sets out in search of gold, dragging the reluctant Miranda along behind.
The latest in a long line of magical movie crazies, Charlie is an actor's dream -- he's lovable, nuts, young enough to be sexy, old enough to be forgiven, and can't be held responsible for anything. Douglas eats it up, his Charlie relishing life in general, and especially the way the sober Miranda reacts to his eccentricities.
A dreamy tone, underlined by David Robbins' banjo-and-ukulele-driven, old-timey blues score, adds the right lighthearted accent, especially given Wood's dour performance.
It takes a while for "King of California" to get in a groove, with Charlie showing that given the right attitude, people can get away with almost anything.
When he traces the location of his not-entirely-mythical treasure to the underside of a Costco's store, puts on a red road-construction vest and starts surveying the place, his sense of entitlement has store employees helping him invade their own space.
His antics mortify poor Miranda, but the sense of absurdity with which Cahill walks Charlie through his adventure should tickle anyone who finds our humorless, security-obsessed public life something less than joyous.
Production values are top-notch. James Whitaker's cinematography, particularly his night-shooting, is superb.

Michael Douglas  is a mental patient on the loose, out to liberate Spanish gold buried beneath a Costco or maybe a Petco , or perhaps that Applebees over yonder. Bushy-bearded, wild-eyed and dressed like an art-directed hobo, Douglas looks like hes working on a Wonder Boys  sequel; if only. Instead, were merely off to Crazytown, with Evan Rachel Wood  along for the bumpy ride as Douglass poor, put-upon daughter who finds her solitary, humdrum existencenights working at McDonalds, days wandering the empty houseruined by the return of her nutty pops, who somehow convinces the pragmatic teen to go on late-night and roadside scavenger hunts armed with only a metal detector, some old journals, and a gardeners shovel. Hard to tell whats more annoying in this empty character study of eccentrics and the suckers who love them: the braying, blurting soundtrack or Douglas himself, who cant find his way into a man tortured by dull demons. As for Wood, theres but one saving grace: At least she doesnt have to sing Beatles  songs, as shes forced to do in Across the Universe . That automatically renders King of California  her best bad film of 2007, hands down.
