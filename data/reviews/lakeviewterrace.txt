By all rights, any movie that pairs Jackson with LaBute should be a four-alarm fire. Jackson, as we well know, is Hollywood�s poet laureate of high-volume profanity, and LaBute is its undisputed king of emotional malevolence, using words to rip open the dark, self-absorbed heart of the modern American condition. So, Jackson playing a violent cop in a LaBute film should be a no-brainer: two hours of delicious psychosexual terror and verbal brutality posing as a movie. Unfortunately, LaBute the brilliant writer (In the Company of Men
) doesn�t make an appearance in Lakeview Terrace
, only LaBute the average director. The writing has been left to David Loughery � who subjected us to Star Trek V
, Passenger 57
, and Money Train
 � and Howard Korder � whose greatest success up to this point has been as a writer for the dreadful 1980s sitcom Kate & Allie
. The result is a by-the-book domestic thriller about the consequences of moving into a neighborhood lorded over by a rules-happy sociopath with a gun and a badge. The unfortunate souls doing the moving are Chris and Lisa Mattson (Wilson and Washington), an attractive newlywed couple who have just purchased their first home. From the moment their U-Haul pulls into their new upper-middle-class Los Angeles neighborhood, it�s clear the guy next door, Abel Turner (Jackson), hates them with a passion bordering on mania. Hates them in part for their laughing, freewheeling ways and seeming indifference to the rules of society but mainly because Chris is white and Lisa is black and the world just isn�t supposed to work that way. Giving voice and action to that hatred, Turner wreaks havoc on the Mattsons' quiet lives, antagonizing them with veiled threats and subtle acts of intimidation before turning to all-out psychological warfare, eventually forcing the formerly agreeable Chris to fight back. Jackson was born to play characters like Turner, angry souls lashing out at the world but not entirely unamused by their own deviousness and brutality � Iago with a dirty mouth and a gun � and he makes the scenery-swallowing most out of an underwritten, undercooked role. Aside from that, however, Lakeview Terrace
 is boilerplate stuff through and through, aiming to play on our shared fear of a besieged home life but settling instead for being a bland study in improbable vigilantism and profound domestic irritation.


In "Lakeview Terrace," Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington play Chris and Lisa, interracial yuppie lovebirds who've just moved from Oakland to the Deep South. I don't mean Alabama or Mississippi. I mean Southern California, the suburbs of LA to be exact, where their new next-door neighbor is Abel Turner (Samuel L. Jackson), a black cop, widower, and Republican father of two who hates, hates, hates watching a foxy sister fool around with a foxy white dude.
Not in his backyard. Apparently, not in their own, either.
Abel wages a torture campaign that might qualify him for employment at Guantanamo. His security floodlights shine into their bedroom. Tires are slashed, friends harassed, central air sabotaged. What is Abel's goal? Winning "Survivor LA"? His plan may be fine for a bad neighbor-from-hell boiling-point thriller, in which the harassed strike back against their harasser. But the makers of "Lakeview Terrace" also want to make a stab at social commentary.
Chris and Lisa aren't merely white, black, and from Oakland. They're interracial Prius drivers from Oakland. The liberal semaphores thicken. He works for an expanding supermarket chain called Good. She does some kind of pro bono design work from home. They're even Utne Reader subscribers. To Abel's consternation, many of the friends at their housewarming party are mixed-race couples. And after Abel proceeds to bait the friends into provoking his rage, one nervous guest changes the subject to wine. "It's Zinfandel," Lisa says. Then she remembers something: "White Zinfandel!"
"Lakeview Terrace" was written by David Loughery and Howard Korder and directed by Neil LaBute, the playwright taking another vacation from his own confrontational material. It's unclear what they want us to think about these characters or their lives, but LaBute doesn't seem to be a fan. He often captures Wilson's character, especially, at his most laughable. This is a white guy who likes hip-hop, but he looks like a zombie when it's on. Only when he chases a would-be intruder with a lacrosse stick are you forced to think, "Now that's more like it."
The movie might have something to say about black racism, but the conversations go nowhere, and the cliches of the genre take over. Plus there's a giant authenticity problem. Lisa never tells off the cop-next-door. She's merely reactive and passive, neither of which seems to be in the character's nature - nor in Kerry Washington's, for that matter. A thriller about a comfortably middle-class black man harassing a comfortably middle-class black woman is some kind of first for the movies, and warrants more than the stupendously toothless treatment we get here.
Actually, the script feels like it's been collecting dust on someone's desk since the LA riots. (Chris actually makes a "Can't we all get along?" plea, and the riots themselves have been replaced with the hokey threat of encroaching wildfires.) Through it all, Jackson is appropriately ridiculous, all but winking at the camera. In similarly charged racial territory, he was a lot better in last year's "Black Snake Moan." Here he's taken Denzel Washington's "Training Day" performance and has so wrung it out for comedy that his character never lives in the world as we know it. He lives in "Crash."


In Lakeview Terrace , a chain- yanking home-invasion thriller, Samuel L. Jackson  operates in two familiar modes: eyeballs-popping and eyelids-narrowing. As Abel, a testy L.A. cop living in an upscale cul-de-sac with two new next-door neighbors he hates (Patrick Wilson  and Kerry Washington ), Jackson spends most of the film peeping over their fence or reacting to   perceived slights. Although his eyes once again act the bejesus out of the script, the shtick has gotten old: It's like watching dusty, less perfect retakes of his Ezekiel 25:17 speech from Pulp Fiction . Unfortunately, Jackson is the best thing here.  The rest of Lakeview  is cravenly engineered to make Wilson's squishy liberal hero a man , and the only surprise is that Neil LaBute (In the Company of Men  ) directed it for hire. This time, there's no art to his manipulations of the plot.

 “Lakeview Terrace,” directed by Neil LaBute from a script by David Loughery and Howard Korder, belongs to a reasonably familiar subgenre: the suburban psycho-neighbor noir. At the beginning, little suspecting what horrors lie ahead, an attractive young married couple, Lisa and Chris Mattson (Kerry Washington and Patrick Wilson), move into a lovely new house on a quiet cul-de-sac amid the hills and canyons of Los Angeles County. There is no lake to be seen, but the property does afford a nice view of metaphorical wildfires   in the distance.  Next to Chris and Lisa lives Abel Turner, single dad and Los Angeles cop, whose behavior rapidly escalates from odd to creepy to menacing to murderous. Abel disapproves of the rap music Chris listens to and the cigarettes he smokes, and holds opinions  that make his Prius-driving, liberal-minded new neighbors a little uncomfortable. He’s a law-and-order conservative who doesn’t believe in global warming, and his views on interracial romance would not be out of place in Jim Crow-era Mississippi.  The twist in this tired scenario — a variation that allows Mr. LaBute, not for the first time, to assume the posture of social provocateur — is that Abel is not your average white bigot but rather a righteously angry, or at least seriously crazy, black one, played by (who else?) Samuel L. Jackson. Abel finds various pretexts for abusing and humiliating Chris, but it’s clear from the start that this white man’s marriage to a black woman is the main source of his   animus.  His fury might be interesting if it were rooted in anything more than the filmmakers’ glib desire to play with the audience’s assumptions. The hostility of a middle-age, middle-class African-American man toward a younger, more privileged, racially mixed couple is a potentially interesting subject, fraught with bitter history and complicated sexual politics. But Bernie Mac did more with the topic in a few throwaway moments of the lamebrain comedy “Guess Who” than Mr. Jackson manages in all of “Lakeview Terrace.” Abel’s resentment of Chris and Lisa exists in a political and cultural vacuum, and turns out in any case to be explained by an episode from Abel’s past that will make your jaw drop (or ache from laughter) when it is revealed.  Mr. Jackson’s glowering, bellowing performance is so close to self-parody that I had to check the end credits to make sure I hadn’t been watching Dave Chappelle doing an extended version of his Comedy Central impersonation. But no, it was indeed Mr. Jackson, who is nothing if not enterprising. Whether he’s chasing snakes on a plane, chaining a wayward young lady to a radiator or persecuting newlyweds in the suburbs, Mr. Jackson can always find a new application for the snarling, sarcastic fury that has come to define his range as an actor.  In the past Mr. LaBute’s filmmaking has occasionally  risen above the level of minimal competence (and sometimes, as in “The Wicker Man,” dropped far below it). Considered purely as a formal exercise, “Lakeview Terrace” is a passable piece of hackwork, with some adequately suspenseful passages and a few mild shocks near the end. But the psychological dimensions of the story are so risible, and its supposed insights into race and class so wrongheaded and ugly, that irritation trumps enjoyment.  Mr. Wilson and Ms. Washington do what they can to bring life to an onscreen marriage that has been arranged solely to annoy Mr. Jackson’s character. The script fails to explore how their relationship might crack under the pressure of Abel’s harassment, preferring to complicate matters with a bit of left-field spousal deception. I won’t disclose the nature of the lie — you may  as well be surprised by something, since you won’t be surprised by how bad this movie is — but it may reassure what fans remain of Mr. LaBute’s rote misanthropy. Your neighbor may be a raging, racist nut case, but the person who’s really out to get you is the one you’re married to.  “Lakeview Terrace” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some sex, violence and strong language.

Bearing notable similarities to a well-publicized recent case in which a black Los Angeles police officer was accused of serially harassing neighbors -- particularly interracially married ones -- "Lakeview Terrace" delivers fairly tense and engrossing drama before succumbing to thriller convention. Samuel L. Jackson's compelling turn as one kind of neighbor almost nobody wants should magnetize some critical favor and aud interest. But as a queasy examination of black/white dynamics, poised between character study and genre piece, director Neil LaBute's latest is likely to score medium B.O. closer to that of 2002's "Changing Lanes" than starry hit "Crash."
Cop Abel Turner (Jackson), the widowed father of two children (Regine Nehy, Jaishon Fisher) kept on a tight disciplinary leash, is at first just mildly interested when moving vans pull up to the house next door. But his expression changes when a smooch identifies Chris (Patrick Wilson) as husband to Lisa (Kerry Washington) -- and we quickly discern that for whatever reason, Abel does not look favorably on a white man and a black woman as spouses.
At first, Abel's nastily instructive sense of humor (he introduces himself to Chris by feigning an armed carjacking) seem, just possibly, misconstrued. Kept awake each night by Abel's security lights glaring into their bedroom window, the couple accept his sorry-I-forgot excuses. They don't jump to conclusions when their air-conditioning system appears sabotaged.
But by the time someone breaks into their garage and slashes Chris' tires, Abel has made it crystal-clear he wants them out of the neighborhood -- and that running to his police breathren won't likely help.
As relations deteriorate further between the two houses, the tension exacerbates already existing conflicts for Lisa and Chris, while Abel's heavy-handed notions about meting out "justice" on the job get him in hot water -- not for the first time, apparently. Meanwhile, another drought year brings wildfires ever closer to this upper-middle-class enclave.
The gradually escalating campaign of harassment, humiliations and payback sounds like something LaBute might have written himself. But this time, he's just in the director's seat for a screenplay by David Loughery (his first produced in 15 years) and Howard Korder from Loughery's story. Notably, the pic was produced by Will Smith and his usual producing partner, James Lassiter.
If the dialogue and personalities here had aped the savagery of LaBute's stage and early screen scripts ("In the Company of Men," "Your Friends and Neighbors"), "Lakeview Terrace" might have tipped into caricature, or at least black-comedy terrain. But the handling on all sides -- most crucially Jackson's -- is judiciously understated.
Until the end, that is. Coda could be worse, but nonetheless disappoints by bringing on mortal home-invasion peril like so many more formulaic thrillers. There's also a fadeout affirmation of family values that feels knee-jerkingly obvious.
Abel is perhaps too mercurial on the written page for full credibility, decrying scanty female dress and rap music one minute, hosting strippers and a blaring house party the next. Still, Jackson's astutely measured turn does a lot to muffle such doubts, at least until the viewer has time for hindsight scrutiny.
The pic was primarily shot in the affluent L.A. County burg of Walnut (whose population is, in fact, Asian-American by a slim majority). The widescreen presentation is clean and unfussy, recalling the minimalist aesthetic of LaBute's first films without quite replicating their severity.
The excellent Washington ably fills out a character who's less than fully sketched; less so Wilson, who's both solid and indistinct, continuing his screen path of being very good in morally ambiguous roles ("Hard Candy," "Little Children") but bland in straight-arrow ones ("The Phantom of the Opera," "Evening").
Among the supporting cast, only Ron Glass, as Lisa's father, and Nehy, as the teenage daughter chafing under Abel's rigid control, have the space to make a real impression in the tightly focused script.
Tech package is expert.

Earlier this year, when I found myself assigned to jury duty on a drug-related trial at the Los Angeles Superior Court, our jury foreman turned out to be a blond, blue-eyed reality-TV producer from the bedroom community of Altadena . During the jury-selection process, when the judge asked if we had any particular positive or negative feelings about the police, the producer responded that he was very pleased with the work of the LAPD, who had helped to rid his neighborhood of some unsavory characters prone to "smoking marijuana and listening to hip-hop" at unconscionable hours of the day and night. This, in turn, elicited rolled eyes and an audible huff from a young African-American man also seated in the jury box. Lakeview Terrace   is a movie that lives in such moments.
At first glance, it may puzzle followers of dramatist and occasional filmmaker Neil LaBute  (In the Company of Men , The Shape of Things ) that the American stage's crown prince of psychosexual power plays and the post-coital mindfuck has opted to follow his universally mocked 2006 remake of The Wicker Man  by working as a director-for-hire on a yuppies-in-peril thriller that seems about two decades past its freshness date. But peer beneath Lakeview Terrace 's lurid, exploitation-movie surface and you will find a vintage LaBute proposition: a taut three-hander that explores the space between surface appearances and realities, between what people say and what they really think.
Set in the titular suburb of Los Angeles's San Fernando Valley —the one where Rodney King  was assaulted by police in 1991—the movie is about the troubles that arise when a newlywed interracial couple moves in next-door to a widowed African-American cop with three decades of service under his belt. There goes the neighborhood.
Lakeview Terrace  begins with a shrewd moving-in scene, during which LAPD officer Abel Turner  (Samuel L. Jackson ) glances out his window at the new arrivals over the septic tank and briefly mistakes Chris Mattson  (Patrick Wilson ), the jocular, white husband of an alluring, well-dressed black woman (Kerry Washington ), for one of the movers. A bit later, they meet-cute in the driveway—Chris smoking a covert cigarette behind the wife's back while rap music blares from his iPod , until Abel taps on his car window, flashlight in hand. "You can listen to that noise all night long, but when you wake up in the morning, you'll still be white," the cop says before uttering a forced chuckle. Things only get more Pacific Heights  from there: Turner's megawatt security lights illuminate the Mattson bedroom like a football field; air-conditioner wires are not-so-mysteriously cut in the dead of summer; tires are slashed. When someone breaks into the young couple's garage in the middle of the night, Chris arms himself with his college lacrosse stick before running downstairs to investigate. Can you get any whiter than that?
Because it's being marketed as a run-of-the-mill psycho-cop romp, Lakeview Terrace  will likely be evaluated solely on those terms. And as a suspense picture, it's only ho-hum, LaBute being the sort of director—much like his fellow playwright-filmmaker, David Mamet —who possesses only the most rudimentary know-how concerning the tools of cinema. (When he really  wants to emphasize something, he cuts to a close-up and adds a musical sting on the soundtrack.) But like a lot of better genre fare, Lakeview Terrace  uses its predictable premise to mount a stealth attack on the audience's sensibilities. Written by David Loughery  and Howard Korder , this may be the perfect movie for the political moment, in that it's about people's latent prejudices—the ones they don't admit to in mixed company, and perhaps can't even acknowledge to themselves. Wilson, in particular, is very good as the Chicago native who went to Stanford  on an athletic scholarship and, despite fancying himself an open-minded liberal, gives off an air of smug WASP privilege. He moves across the screen with the blissful self-confidence of someone who's never known what it means to be glared upon with innate suspicion. Watching him, we understand how an Abel Turner might take umbrage.
Lakeview Terrace  never quite realizes when enough is enough, hunkering down the narrative with an overly symbolic brush fire that threatens our picture-postcard suburbia, giving Jackson's character a wholly unnecessary backstory, and culminating in an over-the-top finale full of ethereal light and crucifix poses. But along the way, it's one of those rare American movies about race in which things are shades of gray. Rather deftly, there's even a car crash or two, though that doesn't bring any of the movie's characters closer to a shared understanding. Can't we all just get along? LaBute doesn't deign to pretend like he knows the answer.
