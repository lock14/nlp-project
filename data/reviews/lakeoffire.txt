A movie on the subject of abortion that doesn't sadden, outrage, shock, or politicize some of the people some of the time isn't doing its job. And by this measure, Lake of Fire  is a success. It's impossible to watch Tony Kaye's theatrically supercharged, equal-opportunity button-pusher without experiencing a welter of emotions  which is just what the filmmaker planned. Here, after all, are some who consider abortion to be murder (sometimes killing to make their point), others who support the right to choose, and a couple of women who exercise those rights on camera.
The title itself, a reference to a biblical notion of hell reserved for sinners, is a demand for attention; Kaye, who exercised his right to artistic soapbox oratory in 1998's American History X , is not a filmmaker with much use for limbo. Shot in dramatic black and white (or is it shades of gray?) that lends its subjects and settings a heightened sense of crisis and journalistic gravitas, the movie wanders from opinion to opinion about the '' rightness'' or '' wrongness'' of terminating a pregnancy, provided by commentators of certified intensity of purpose. The women, including Sarah Weddington, who argued for ''Jane Roe'' in the precedent-setting 1973 Supreme Court case of Roe v. Wade, tend to be photographed in unforgiving near-surgical close-up, while the men, including scholar Noam Chomsky, and Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry, are given kinder visual breathing room.
But the philosophizing of talking heads, however well-spoken, lulls in comparison with the direct pain felt watching a prematurely aged 28-year-old woman before, during, and after her own very real abortion; it's not her first in a hard life of domestic abuse. Or the fury felt hearing judgmental antiabortion activists claiming God on their side while advocating death to doctors who perform the legal procedure. Or the moral disturbance of seeing a minuscule fetal hand on a tray of discards after a 20-week termination.
Kaye famously worked on Lake of Fire  for many years, and much of that time was spent, no doubt, getting just the right interview footage from just the right roster of proponents for each side of the argument. (In the course of the project's long gestation period, bombings of women's health clinics have become less of a threat to those who defend legal abortion than the increasingly conservative composition of the Supreme Court.) I have no problem with anyone  even the most infuriating dogmatist  speaking his or her views on the subject, nor do I mind any of the graphic bluntness. I do, though, get exasperated with Kaye's distracting fondness for graphic stunts. Accompanied by undistinguished liturgical music, close-ups on religious iconography tell me nothing pertinent to any argument. And absolutely every person interviewed is first identified in upside-down typography that then spins and rights itself. Why? Viewer opinions about life and death provoked by Lake of Fire  are not likely to flip, but they sure will get shaken.

 The first thing you should know about the documentary “Lake of Fire” — an unblinking look at the violent fight over abortion in the United States, including  those homegrown religious fundamentalists who kill in the name of God — is that it was made in black and white. This is critical. Because the other thing you should know about this fascinating, discomfiting, at times unpleasant, confused and confusing film is that it sets off extremely graphic images of actual abortions against a notorious photograph of a woman who died after an illegal motel room abortion, visuals that are inflammatory if, for the most part, also germane.  Not everyone will agree about the abortion visuals, including, perhaps, those who worry that such explicit imagery can speak louder than any pro-abortion-rights  argument. It’s an understandable concern. Because they are filmed (the dead woman is immortalized in a still photograph), the abortions are unnerving, which is why I suggest that the faint of heart skip the rest of this paragraph. After the first operation, a second-trimester abortion, the doctor sorts through a tray of fetal parts, including a perfect-looking tiny hand and a foot, to make sure that nothing has been left inside the patient, which might lead to poisoning or even death. The doctor then holds up the severed fetal head. One eerily bulging eye looks as if it’s staring into the camera and somehow at us.  My initial and admittedly angry first thought about these images was that the director, Tony Kaye, was just resorting to shock tactics. The film doesn’t employ narration or on-screen texts that reveal his views on abortion; instead, there are 152 minutes of talking-head testimonials, on-the-street interviews and  archival and new visuals. This means that you have to pay extra-special attention to his filmmaking choices, to the way he juxtaposes sights and sounds and who gets to speak and when.  His choices can be baffling. The ludicrous opening credits (anguished  music, candles shaped like praying hands) could be straight out of a cheap horror flick, though the later presence of heavyweights like Noam Chomsky points to more sober ambitions.  The British-born Mr. Kaye started his life in images by directing commercials, a form that relies on bold visuals and simple messages. He went on to direct the flashy “American History X” (1998), about a charismatic neo-Nazi, though he lost control of the project to its star, Edward Norton. Mr. Kaye began shooting material for “Lake of Fire” (the title refers to hell) in the early 1990s, a process that consumed an uncommonly long 16  years. He has stated that he was interested in making a “socially conscious” dramatic film, but decided to make a documentary that would represent the issue in its complexity, despite knowing nothing about the form. His ignorance has its dividends. Shot primarily in sumptuous, often disquietingly beautiful 35-millimeter film, “Lake of Fire” doesn’t look anything like most American documentaries.  The decision to use black and white was smart because, as with “Schindler’s List,” too much red might well have sent audiences fleeing from theaters. The absence of color blunts the force of the images (the sounds of the machinery  are still unsettling), which allows you to watch the movie rather than avert your gaze and your rattled mind.  Mr. Kaye has an irritating, sometimes self-undermining weakness for shocking visuals (and edits), but it’s clear from all the time he spent on this project and from the different voices he’s gathered that he was genuinely interested in making a serious work, one that explores its subject with far more depth and breadth than the usual run-and-gun documentaries.  In the main, he has succeeded, notably through an array of mostly male journalists, activists, ministers, lawyers and academics, including the philosopher Peter Singer and the writer  Nat Hentoff, who lay out the arguments  and scan the terrain. Some sound rational, coolly dispassionate; others smile and spew. A few of the more vivid characters, specifically religious extremists who believe that America should be a Christian nation and that abortion providers should be executed alongside homosexuals, adulterers and blasphemers, are, well, something else. Intentionally or not, Mr. Kaye has made a documentary that vividly delineates how religious-fundamentalist terrorists take root  in a country, slide around the law and gain legitimacy (martyrdom), and how those who profess to love God can justify murder.  Which leads me back to some of the more shocking images in “Lake of Fire.” It’s possible that Mr. Kaye opted to show several abortions because he wanted viewers, particularly those sympathetic to a woman’s right to abortion, to understand what stirs some people not just to action, but also to kill doctors. If nothing else, the first abortion in the film (of a 20-week-old fetus, though that information is not in the film) reinforces what an abstraction the term pro-choice really is. Abortion does end the life of something. The fight, of course, is over what that something is — an embryo, a baby, God’s creation, a blob of cells — and who has dominion over it and the fully formed human being carrying that something inside her body.  I wish there were more of those fully formed human beings in “Lake of Fire,” which has an awful lot of men talking about what women should and should not do with their bodies. There are women here, to be sure, though it may be instructive that one of the most memorable female voices belongs to an unreliable witness who talks about seeing “babies” stacked in an abortion-clinic freezer. Mr. Kaye follows this startling testimonial with otherworldly and unidentified images of intact late-term fetuses or babies or maybe even dolls. Because I couldn’t tell what I was looking at, I asked the film’s distributor. According to the company, these images had been given to Mr. Kaye by members of the anti-abortion group Operation Rescue.  One lesson of “Lake of Fire” is the galvanizing power of the visual image. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words, and sometimes pictures are not enough. Although the film doesn’t identify her, the dead woman in the photograph that Mr. Kaye shows us late in the film is Gerri Santoro. In 1964, when abortion was not yet a constitutional right, she and a male lover checked into a Connecticut motel room, where he tried to perform an abortion. She had become pregnant and feared that her estranged husband, who beat her and their children, would find out. Something went wrong, and the lover fled. Ms. Santoro died,  smeared in blood, defeated, naked and alone. Before she was a symbol, she was a person.

A personal, self-financed project by British helmer Tony Kaye, "Lake of Fire" reps an extraordinary docu achievement. Handsomely filmed on silvery 35mm and high-definition by Kaye himself, the shrewdly edited pic balances a full spectrum of views from all sides of the abortion debate without obviously taking a position itself. Blending ethical philosophy, human drama and disturbing images of dismembered fetuses, pic compels auds to reassess their own feelings about this contentious issue. "Fire" generated hot buyer interest in Toronto, but the cut caught may not be final, per helmer, and the material may next emerge as part of a longer TV series.
Kaye first made a splash in advertising by helming expensive, eye-catching commercials in Blighty during the '80s and '90s for big-name clients like Nike, Volkswagen, Dunlop tires and others. Famously, he fell out with producing studio New Line and star Edward Norton over his stylized drama "American History X," allegedly because Kaye refused to finish editing the pic.
The long gestation period -- 17 years according to the helmer -- for "Lake of Fire," and rumors that this 152-minute edit may only be a work in progress suggests Kaye may still be wrestling with completion anxieties.
However, the version caught at Toronto fest hardly needs much improving. Wisely eschewing the use of a voiceover to create a single editorial voice, and holding subtitles to a minimum, revealing just names and facts, pic builds up a remarkable collage of footage, mixing talking heads with more dynamic scenes of protests, court trials and surgical procedures.
Interviewees speaking directly to camera range from linguist and cultural critic Noam Chomsky and Catholic campaigner Frances Kissling (both adamantly pro-choice), to lawyer Alan Dershowitz (more mixed on the issue), to eminent jazz critic Nat Hentoff, who although he professes to be an atheist still firmly believes a fetus has just as much right to life as any infant.
More typical, religiously informed pro-lifers include homophobic fundamentalist Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, seen being heckled by transvestites at a Washington, D.C., rally, and various other Florida-based anti-abortion zealots, some of whom (Michael Griffin and Paul Hill) ended up murdering doctors who performed abortions. Footage of Griffin and Hill's trials is seen, while sociologist Dallas Blanchard acts as a commentator and guide through their case histories.
Kaye also includes footage of a clearly deranged Hill before he committed his crime declaiming that people who say "God damn it" will be condemned to eternal suffering in hell.
Editing moves effortlessly between political and ethical speechifying and more personal stories. Some are famous, like Norma McCorvey, aka Jane Roe, the woman pseudonymously named in the key 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in the U.S. and who is now a passionate pro-lifer.
In contrast, a 29-year-old woman named Stacey is observed going through the whole process of having a termination, from the counseling to the procedure itself. Afterward, she's shaken but unrepentant about having made the right decision for her.
Pro-choice auds will hear little from the rightists seen here that will change their minds. However, even the most committed supporter of a woman's right to choose is likely to feel shaken by footage of the mangled corpse of 4-month-old fetus, turned into a jumble of limbs and crushed skull fragments in a surgeon's tray.
Pic's use of monochrome stock, draining the red out of the imagery, will be most welcome for the faint of heart, although the helmer has said the decision to film the pic without color sprang from a desire to show how this so-called "black and white" issue is really all about shades of grey.
Use of music -- some of it written for the pic by Anne Dudley, some of it from Henry Gorecki's plangent but overused Third Symphony -- occasionally goes into overkill mode. Otherwise, tech credits are immaculate.

Named for the spot in Christian-fundamentalist hell where sinners are condemned to spend eternity, Tony Kaye 's Lake of Fire  is a provocatively beautiful movie on the hottest hot-button issue in American life: a woman's right to an abortion.
The British-born Kaye, an enormously successful maker of deluxe TV commercials, relocated to the U.S. in the early '90s and has been crusading ever since. Having directed Edward Norton  to what would be an Oscar-nominated performance as a SoCal neo-Nazi skinhead in the 1998 American History X , Kaye fought with his studio over the movie's final cut. He then ran himself out of the industry with a monumental tantrum that included yanking American History X  from the Toronto International Film Festival , buying 35 full-page ads to denounce his producer in the trades, and suing the Directors Guild. (After 9/11, Kaye nearly got himself thrown out of the country by dressing up as Osama bin Laden  for a stand-up comedy act.)
Stable, no; persistent, yes; megalomaniacal, undoubtedly; eccentric, veryand also something of a visionary: 17 years in the self-financed making, Lake of Fire  may be as daringly aestheticized as any social documentary since Errol Morris 's The Thin Blue Line . Despite its surface sheen, however, Lake of Fire  is hardly detached from the passions it records. This surprisingly fluid and continuously engaging two-and-a-half-hour movie, which Kaye shot himself in luminous black-and-white and almost entirely in 35mm, is at once monumental and ghostly, further dematerialized by Anne Dudley 's ethereal score.
Lake of Fire  is, in one sense, a travelogue through a battle-scarred terrain contested by religious fundamentalists and beleaguered feministsnone of whom are shy in addressing Kaye's camera or getting in some counterdemonstrator's face. Turf wars are literal. Zealots stake out abortion clinics by buying adjacent property. (Abortion-rights heroine "Jane Roe" was converted to a pro-life icon after Operation Rescue  set up shop next-door to the clinic where she worked.) Faith promotes violence, rhetorical and otherwise. Abortion is repeatedly compared to the Holocaust. Doctors wear bulletproof vests; extremists threaten to use truck bombs. A security guard describes a shoot-out in a Massachusetts clinic; the shooter tells the cops that he gets his authority from the pope and that "if every Catholic was like me, the Catholic Church would have whatever it wanted."
Kaye is not Michael Moore . Lake of Fire  provides no overt overview, only variations on the same conflict. As filmmaking, it's largely noncoercive, allowing viewers ample time to read the faces and study the performances of sundry American types. Everyone thinks that this isor should bea free country, but there's no agreement as to what that means. For pro-life "libertarians," the state seemingly exists to police women. (If the issue is individual freedom, however, to be pro-life would necessarily be pro-choice.) As Kaye draws the lines, the ultimate distinction is not between pro-choice and pro-life, but between those who articulate moral unease and those who speak with absolute conviction.
Few people are as consistent as Voice  writer Nat Hentoff , globalizing his pro-life stance to include pacifism, opposition to the death penalty, and a vague allegiance to social justice. But consistency carries its own simplification: As the radio ranter Randall Terry  puts it, "Intolerance is a beautiful thing." Early on, legal scholar Alan Dershowitz  genially recounts a Hasidic parable suggesting that there are issues in which everybody is right. More rationally, Noam Chomsky  affirms that there are no absolute values in life. And life is for the living, asserts animal-rights philosopher Peter Singer , arguing that botched abortions are more immoral than successful ones. But at what one point does a fetus become a person? Is contraception also a crime?
To some degree, the anti-abortion jihad has been sublimated into George W. Bush 's war. But this frontline report of combat in the culture zone provides a vivid and, in a sense, prophetic flashback to the Clinton era. Early on, Kaye (who is never seen and hardly ever heard) visits a pro-life demonstration, for which the organizers have filled the Washington mall with a forest of little crosses meant to represent "the children of Hillary 's village." It's a powerful image that Kaye complicates with camera placement: The protesters appear to kneel before the looming Washington Monument, worshipping the ultimate metaphor for patriarchal authority. (Throughout, right-to-life advocates have a propensity for casting fathers as victims.)
Not everything in Lake of Fire  is symbolic, however. Kaye is unflinching in showing an abortion's gruesome fetal remains, as well as graphic images of women who died during self-induced abortions. And nothing appears out of context: In the movie's final section, a battered woman named Stacy and the lumpen-looking guy who impregnated her go for an abortion in an empty downtown moonscape. Surveillance cameras track the couple as they enter the building. Stacy is extensively prepped, as are we; the procedure is then documented to its end.
Lake of Fire  may be a mirror for the viewer's particular burning convictions, but it has no brief for total certainty. "I know I made the right decision, but it's still not easy," Stacy cries after her abortion. For a movie that shows the unshowable and might well induce a migraine given the pounding conviction with which God's will is invoked, Kaye's jeremiad is remarkably non-judgmental. The movie is shot in black and white, but projects as shades of gray.
