Duty and the general state of things in Hollywood, I suppose, make us feel grateful for a woman-centered Hollywood movie that stars an abundant number of award-winning actresses, is co-scripted by a Pulitzer Prize-winning author (Michael Cunningham of The Hours
), features an outstanding number of women among its technical crew, and is directed by the highly accomplished cinematographer-turned-director Koltai. However, grateful and praiseworthy are hardly the same things. Evening
 has so much going for it that it's painful to report that all this window dressing is to no avail. The performances are terrific, even occasionally breathtaking in small moments, but they are hampered by an overly convoluted script that takes a very simple concept and complicates it with a back-and-forth temporal flow and an overabundance of characters and relationships. Based on the novel by Susan Minot (who co-wrote the screenplay with The Hours
' Cunningham), Evening
 is the story of the dying hours of Ann Lord (Redgrave), who, during these moments, reflects solely on an evening some 50 years ago when she believes she made an unrecoverable mistake in love. In her fevered state, she makes cryptic comments about the night to her two dutiful daughters (played by Collette and the actress' real-life daughter Richardson). The events of 50 years ago are played out by Danes as the young Ann and her friend Lila (Gummer � Streep's real-life daughter, who is a revelatory chip off the old block). Atkins is the bedside nurse, who is prone to magical moments sheathed in gossamer. There are a couple of men (Wilson and Dancy), one of whom is the mistake, but we have to take that on faith since the movie shows us virtually nothing of Ann's subsequent 50 years so that we may decide for ourselves if a mistake has or has not been made � and, moreover, whether it matters in the least. Even from the depths of her bedsheets, Redgrave still manages to inspire awe, yet a poetically prosaic moment like the one in which she goes chasing after a butterfly is enough to throw a net over the whole thing. However, when Streep, as the older Lila, comes for a last-act visit to the dying Ann and climbs into bed with her, the two share a peerless bravura moment in which all gripes about the movie are temporarily forgiven.


"Evening" is the sort of film certain moviegoers say they want more of during the summer and never get. Well, now they've got it: a tony period drama full of the most esteemed stars. The film's ads promise nothing less than "the Greatest Actresses of Our Time." Redgrave . Streep . Close . Atkins . (Hopefully, someone is keeping the news from Judi Dench, who is not here.)
The film is being released as an antidote to summer super-productions. Nothing in "Evening" blows up. None of the costumes are made of Lycra, and the acting is the only special effect that matters. But isn't this a kind of blockbuster, a ladies-night "Ocean's Thirteen"? Regardless what you call it, "Evening" delivers these women in top form. Were Vanessa Redgrave's performance presented in Dolby Digital Surround it would blow you to the back of the theater. Rarely has a knock at death's door been this vivid.
Between her stage work as Joan Didion in "The Year of Magical Thinking " and her bizarrely underappreciated performance as Peter O'Toole's ex in "Venus ," Redgrave has been staring mor t ality in the face lately. In "Evening," which Lajos Koltai directed and Michael Cunningham and Susan Minot adapted from one of her novels of regret, Redgrave lies in a sickbed. She plays Ann Lord , a woman wracked with guilt over some awful secret from her past. Ann's outbursts about an old lover ("Harris
!") bewilder her 
home-care nurse (Eileen Atkins ) and her daughters -- Natasha Richardson and Toni Collette (the movie even has the greatish actresses of our time). To explain Ann's agony, the film travels backward about 50 years to the scene of the alleged crime.
Really, all we're talking about 
 is a WASP-y Newport, R.I., wedding, for which young Ann (Claire Danes) has schlepped all the way from Greenwich Village to sing a song. The bride, Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer ), is Ann's best college friend, and she's terrified that she's marrying the wrong fellow. Since the man she truly covets -- the aforementioned Harris -- is played by Patrick Wilson , I'd say Lila is right to second-guess herself. But she should take a number since almost everybody on the Wittenborns' seaside property (Glenn Close plays the matriarch) eventually finds him scrumptious, too, including Ann. Even Lila's emotionally rickety brother, Buddy (Hugh Dancy ), harbors a crush that's evident the minute he introduces Ann to Harris, a doctor and family friend.
Wilson seems content to play these sorts of ornamental roles. He's like Grace Kelly, if Grace Kelly were a high school quarterback. It would have been more interesting for Wilson and the electric Dancy to switch parts. Then again, Harris's beauty has to make an impression that leaves a girl reeling all the way to her deathbed. And it's Wilson who is cursed with that gift.
Rather effortlessly, the film oscillates between the wedding weekend's melodrama and the theater of Redgrave's unvarnished face. But what happens in Newport almost doesn't seem worthy of wherever Ann's eyes are wistfully gazing as she drifts in and out of coherence.
The setting of Minot's book has been moved from Maine and the Dancy character has been bulked up until a triangle forms around him, Ann, and Harris. But what was special about the novel was the diverging friendship between young Ann and Lila, who embark on different paths through womanhood. The scenes between Danes and Gummer sitting up in bed talking about the decisions they're about to make have a human truth that's missing almost everywhere else in the movie. They're echoed almost erotically when Streep, as the older Lila, shows up at Redgrave's bedside during the seventh-inning stretch.
Whatever "Evening" is saying about life, death, and guilt isn't terribly new or interesting -- we live, we die, sometimes we pore over the highlights before we go. Wise old Ann gives her daughters -- and, by extension, us -- bromides we can take with us on the drive home. These sorts of reliable sentiments are just what some people come to these movies for.
But the most fascinating thing about the movie is its actorly constellation. Every day on the set must have felt like Take Your Daughter to Work Day. Redgrave, of course, is Richardson's mother. But you spend a lot of the film pondering the idea that Danes's coquettishness will, somehow, age into Redgrave's refinement and that Gummer will become her own mother -- Streep. That Close actually plays Gummer's mother is amazing since, with all respect to her dad, she looks the child Close and Streep might have produced -- a pellucid face loaded with points and angles.
David Hare adapted Cunningham's book "The Hours" into a film about the well-heeled, seemingly made for the well-heeled. Both movies specialize in a brand of idealized upscale soapiness: these are the suds of our lives. "Evening" is not as artistically oppressive as "The Hours." The anguish, in fact, is comparatively low. And Koltai, a cinematographer whose previous movie was the equally fluid Hungarian Holocaust drama "Fateless ," comfortably connects now to then without too many overbearing symbols or bogus transitions.
Still, not even a firm approach can rescue "Evening" from the enveloping thematic finery. It's a hopelessly classy piece of china.


         An impressive pedigree doesn't always guarantee a felicitous outcome, as any number of Hapsburgs or Hiltons will confirm. Unfortunately, the same goes for Lajos Koltai's adaptation of novelist Susan Minot's "Evening," which despite its fine source material and roster of formidable talent — to glance at the poster is to realize that under no circumstances should these people be allowed to board a plane together — lurches clumsily across two very long, disconnected hours, reducing Minot's, sprawling, ethereal story to a pop psych nugget about embracing life as it comes.
 
 Not that it must have been easy to wrestle this particular multigenerational tome into something suitably cinematic. Minot's novel is as interior and free-associative as they come. The morphine haze deathbed ruminations of a dying woman, Ann Lord (played in her youth by Claire Danes and in her last gasp by Vanessa Redgrave), it spans three unhappy marriages, the birth of her five children, the death of one, her disappointing artistic career and her brief, long-ago affair with the man who may have been, possibly by default, the love of her life.
 


         






   Minot took some initial passes at adapting the film, which was later taken over by Michael Cunningham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "The Hours" (whose book was adapted into an Oscar-winning screenplay by David Hare). Paring down major events and condensing characters — reducing the brood of kids, for instance, to a pair of daughters, and the marriages to a cursory mention and a scene of domestic drudgery  — freed Cunningham to focus on a new-to-the-story vaguely bi-curious threesome that echoes themes from his own work, but doesn't do the movie any favors.
 
 The narrative slowly circles Ann's dying regret, a romantic disappointment that the ensuing 50 years have done nothing to diminish, lurching clumsily between deathbed scenes and golden memories of an apparently perpetually dusky weekend Ann spent in Maine, in the '50s, at the wedding of her best friend, Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer). There she found herself caught up in a brief but tragic love triangle with Lila's drunken brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy) and the handsome son of the Wittenborns' former housekeeper, a young doctor named Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Though a minor character in the book, Buddy has been expanded here into a doomed lush whose affections for Ann and Harris veer in a similar direction. Gone is Harris' pregnant fiancée, and with her conflict and momentum.
 
 As it stands, the love affair between Ann and Harris feels too flimsy to have spawned a lifetime of regret, and its demise feels toothless and unsatisfying.
 
 While the link between Gummer and her real-life mother, Meryl Streep, who makes an appearance near the end as the older Lila, is evident, it's all but impossible to trace a connection between Redgrave's delirious, dying Ann and the version of her younger self. Danes' Ann is a New York bohemian, completely out of place in the wealthy, conservative milieu of Lila's wedding and in the world of the movie — which the screenwriter and director have pumped up from repressive New England WASPs to flashy Newport society types (Newport R.I., as it happens, stands in for Maine).
 
 Danes is a solid screen presence, but her character as written is passive and rueful. Harris may well be her "first mistake," as she tells her daughters, but error implies choice, and Ann appears to be all but a stranger to those. Rather than enlighten us as to what happened between Harris and Ann, and how, exactly, she came to marry the lock-jawed best man at the wedding (and later some other guy who snaps at her), Cunningham and Koltai return us again and again to the lugubrious Massachusetts house where Ann lays dying, attended by her daughters, smug matron Constance (Redgrave's real-life daughter Natasha Richardson) and sour bohemian Nina (Toni Collette). As Ann returns obsessively to the fateful weekend when she met, loved and lost Harris with the grim single-mindedness of a jilted teenager, Nina and Constance engage in an epic battle over that bummer of a pointless argument, women's choices and whether kids equal fulfillment or just get in the way of it.
 
 For all of its class-act bona fides, "Evening" lurches between the morose and the sentimental, with occasional incursions into the absurd — though, naturally, with talent like this onboard, it can't help but have its moments. The single laugh comes near the beginning, courtesy of Glenn Close as Lila's mother, as she agonizes over the seating arrangements for the wedding. And Gummer and Streep turn out well-realized characterizations of the WASP daughter who will dutifully become her mother. Otherwise, there's very little to recommend about this shapeless, plodding piece, which no doubt will inspire dozens of critical predictions about how we ladies will like it. Poor ladies, how we suffer.
 
 
 "Evening." PG-13 for some thematic elements, sexual material, a brief accident scene and language. Running time: 1 hour, 57 minutes. In limited release.   

 Correction Appended  At first, second and final glance, Susan Minot’s “Evening,” a claustrophobic 1998 novel about a woman in her 60s remembering the days and few torrid nights of her life while slowly, very slowly dying, doesn’t seem as if it would translate easily to the big screen. It hasn’t. Stuffed with actors of variable talent, burdened with false, labored dialogue and distinguished by a florid visual style better suited to fairy tales and greeting cards, this miscalculation underlines what can happen when certain literary works meet the bottom line of the movies. It also proves that not every book deserves its own film.  That bottom line might explain why Claire Danes was cast to play the unripened young Ann  in the 1950s, the same character Vanessa Redgrave ushers from this mortal coil in the present. Ms. Danes and Ms. Redgrave bear no resemblance to each other — they’re strangers in look, voice, gesture and screen presence — and neither do the ill-matched Natasha Richardson and Toni Collette, who play Ann’s daughters. Among other things, Ms. Danes looks agonizingly uncomfortable, as she now often does on screen; Ms. Redgrave, by contrast, gives the impression that she’d rather eat a grand piano than surrender the spotlight. Her character may be dying, but she’s dying importantly, with flattering lighting and not a pearl of drool.  But “Evening” is not about sickness and dreadful death. It’s about how some words that pass muster on the page can sound terribly precious coming out of a real person’s mouth. It’s also about how modest projects like this depend on name actors to get made, which probably explains why Claire Danes turns into Vanessa Redgrave, and why Glenn Close pops up in the film as one of those 1950s matriarchs whose tight smiles can’t obscure the epic repression and popping neck tendons that always seem to inflame such characters. Ms. Close breathes life and a hint of camp into a cliché, as does the equally fleet and fleeting Meryl Streep, who shows up in dowager drag as one of the dying Ann’s old friends, Lila.  Adapted by Ms. Minot and Michael Cunningham (“The Hours”), the film scales back the novel’s ambitious design, notably by jettisoning Ann’s imaginary (or spiritual) encounters with her one great love. In the film the dying Ann drifts between the morphine-fogged present, where her daughters pick at each other and their barely healed wounds, and the hothouse refuge of memory. First among her reminiscences are the few days in the 1950s that she spent under the stars and inside a magical shack with Harris (Patrick Wilson), a strapping young doctor with sensitive eyes and apparently even more sensitive hands whom she met at Lila’s wedding. (Ms. Streep’s daughter Mamie Gummer plays the young Lila.)  The film also ditches one of the novel’s central female characters and invests a delicate young man named Buddy with the kind of uncertain sexual desire that Montgomery Clift would have conveyed effortlessly and which the young British actor Hugh Dancy botches. This isn’t wholly his fault. Mr. Dancy has to try to animate a wheezing stereotype and deliver dialogue laden with forced allusions and a sense of doom so foreboding it might as well come accompanied by Chopin’s funeral march. The added complication of Buddy’s confused sexuality and the drama it provokes only makes the young Ann, an already unappealing, callow presence in the novel, seem even less attractive and more selfish on screen.  On her deathbed Ann recalls when her younger self first discovered love, or at least the sort of five-alarm sex that inspires Ms. Minot to reach for words like “ripping” and “clashing” and “hammering” and “scaling” and “diving.” In death Ann floats through the watery memories of youth that nominally sustained her in life, but it is a life strikingly and cripplingly absent any sense of true, blood-warmed experience. It’s no wonder that the Hungarian director Lajos Koltai, whose last film was the very good and affecting Holocaust drama “Fateless,” sinks before he can swim (or dive). He has tried to instill a sense of wonderment into a kitsch romance. He fails badly, but in this he has plenty of company.  “Evening” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Lots of booze, a little sex and an occasional oath.

A woman's deathbed reveries provide a poignant but rather obvious counterpoint to her daughters' present-day emotional concerns in "Evening." As co-scripted by Michael Cunningham ("The Hours"), Susan Minot's adaptation of her own artfully fragmented novel arrives onscreen as another highly polished, star-studded meditation on mortality, regret and the unique drag of being a woman in any generation. Strong literary pedigree and powerhouse cast will appeal to sophisticated auds, and Focus Features' mid-summer launch reps a classic bit of counter-programming, but it remains to be seen if pic will get the year-end kudos and critical attention needed for sustained arthouse biz.
After making his directing debut in 2005 with the strikingly beautiful Holocaust drama "Fateless," Hungarian lenser-turned-helmer Lajos Koltai has sailed into decidedly tonier prestige-pic waters with his second feature -- adapted and exec produced by literary heavyweights Minot and Cunningham, and starring actresses such as Vanessa Redgrave, Glenn Close, Eileen Atkins and Meryl Streep, just for starters.
Redgrave plays aging Ann Lord, whose daughters Constance (Natasha Richardson) and Nina (Toni Collette) have gathered at her bedside in her final moments. When Ann mutters a cryptic sentence amid her feverish ramblings ("Harris and I killed Buddy"), pic takes a page from "The Bridges of Madison County," flashing back to a key moment in the 1950s -- as young Ann Grant (Claire Danes), an aspiring singer from New York, arrives on the coast of Rhode Island for the wedding of her friend Lila Wittenborn (Mamie Gummer).
While at the Wittenborns' summer cottage, Ann is entranced by the mild-mannered, powerfully attractive Dr. Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). Latter exerts a similar pull on his longtime chums Lila -- lovely, insecure and about to marry a decent man she doesn't love -- and Lila's rascally brother Buddy (Hugh Dancy), an aspiring novelist who swings from jovial high spirits to depressive bouts of drunkenness.
As Ann supports Lila through her premarital jitters and explores her attraction to Harris, and Buddy is increasingly racked by boozy fits of self-loathing, the catalysts are in place for a tragedy that becomes the defining moment of Ann's life. Her innocence shattered, she falls into a series of ill-considered (and sparsely depicted) marriages and has two girls, while her singing career flounders.
To freight a single evening with such dramatic significance will rightly smack some viewers as a tad reductive. The more immediate problem with this ambitious, elliptical film is Koltai and editor Allyson C. Johnson's difficulty in establishing a narrative rhythm, as the back-and-forth shifts in time that seemed delicately free-associative on the page are rendered with considerably less grace onscreen. In ways reminiscent of Stephen Daldry's film of "The Hours," the telling connections between past and present feel calculated rather than authentically illuminating (though even with a key character's encroaching demise, "Evening" is overall a less lugubrious affair).
Pic intends to say something meaningful about the emotional legacy mothers bequeath to their daughters, most directly in the scenes between Constance, a happily married mother, and Nina, a restless, somewhat embittered single woman whose failed dancing career reflects her mother's own lost dreams. Though well-played by Richardson and especially Collette, the characters and their sisterly spats feel all too conveniently shaped to reinforce the film's multigenerational themes.
Still, individual moments are not without their felicitous touches -- mainly due to the cast, which is rich to the point of improbability. Though she looks nothing like a young Redgrave, Danes proves engagingly vivacious as the young, bohemian Ann, who's quietly disdained by Lila's socialite mother (Close, in a brief, indelible turn). Gummer's luminous, trembling Lila anchors the film's implicit critique of stiff, upper-class propriety, while Dancy makes a vivid impression in the problematic role of the self-destructive closet case. Atkins brings a no-nonsense warmth to the part of Ann's nurse.
Real-life mother-daughter thesping pairs abound: Redgrave (feeble and senile one minute, wide-awake lucid the next) and Richardson enact their relationship onscreen, and -- in a moment deployed as carefully as a secret weapon -- Streep, Gummer's mother, emerges late in the film for a rewarding extended cameo as the elder Lila.
Koltai brings a cinematographer's eye to the production, with lyrical images -- Redgrave's Ann reclining on a boat dock, or a bedroom suddenly teeming with shimmering moths -- that tend toward the surreal. Lensing by Gyula Pados ("Fateless") shows a studied contrast between the rich luster of the '50s material and the darker contempo footage. Other contributions, including the picturesque locations, production designer Caroline Hanania's meticulous period re-creations and Jan A.P. Kaczmarek's full-bodied score, are pristine.

Parked uneasily between sensitive indie and studio chick-flick, Lajos Koltai 's Evening  makes star-studded hash of Susan Minot 's beautifully written, if emotionally constricted, novel about a terminally ill woman trying to wrestle meaning out of the shards of her memories. Floating in and out of delirium in her Cambridge, Massachusetts , home, Ann Lorda former singer, twice married to men she didn't fully love and vice versais cared for by her two daughters, played in the movie by the world's least likely siblings, Natasha Richardson  and Toni Collette . The sisters are women's-novel cutoutsbickering but close, and initially too preoccupied with their own messy issues to register that their mother keeps calling out a man's name they don't recognize. The novel doesn't have much of a plot, and truth to tell, not much of a secret: Long ago, Ann loved and lost a man named Harris at the New England  wedding of her best friend Lila. But at its best, Minot 's book is less about some objective state we call the past than about the search for the crucial memory that will organize the fragments of Ann's life into a storyor not. Visitors both real and imagined fade in and out, but the unspoken ghost in the room is Proust, with a dab of Virginia Woolf .

Remembering is a novel's business, and notoriously difficult to translate to the screen. Only Raoul Ruiz 's dazzlingly free adaptation of Proust's Time Regained  (whose frame of a dying man trying to unscramble his memories Minot lifted more or less wholesale) has come close to replicating the creative role of recallsparked by fear, desire, and regretin giving shape and significance to the experiential jumble that we call the past.
Koltai's fat résumé as the celebrated cinematographer of movies from Mephisto  to (eek!) Home for the Holidays  seems of little help here. The same is true for his directing debut, Fateless , a brilliant but resolutely linear movie about a Hungarian Jewish boy wandering through Nazi concentration camps. Lost in translation aside from a few allusions to the mind's compulsion to condense and conflate the past Harris visits the sick room periodically, and Ann's night nurse (an underused Eileen Atkins ) appears to her patient in a white satin evening dress Evening  boils down to a flat back-and-forth between old Ann (Vanessa Redgrave , prone and wheezy) and young Ann (a frighteningly thin Claire Danes ), whom we see in prolonged flashbacks screwing up her life with a handsome doctor at the wedding in scenic Rhode Island .
However ably played by the equally scenic Patrick Wilson , Harris is more studmuffin than madeleine, which makes it odd that Koltai has cut out the novel's scads of steamy sex. Odder still that Minotwho's credited as co-screenwriter with Michael Cunningham , author of The Hours  and a connoisseur of defiantly inadequate mothersagreed to that. You have to wonder, too, what she thought of Cunningham's major plot surgery, which corrals just about every hot-eyed young thing in the movie to fall in love with the undeserving Harris, playing up hints of incestuous attraction and inserting a homoerotic subtext involving a painfully miscast Hugh Dancy  as a rich young drunk with forthcoming tragedy in his puppy eyes.
Stripped of the rhythmic lilt of Minot's prose and her delicate probe into the treacheries that time and memory work on our lives, Evening  tips over into farce, leaving us unsure whether Harris is Ann's great love or a complete waste of her time and emotional energy. That's a real question, and it comes as a relief when Meryl Streep , as Lila the Elder, blows into town for a final farewell and some sensible advice for the flailing women gathered at Ann's bedside. As the cautionary tale of mothers and daughters it negligently aspires to be, Evening  is strictly old news. But if nothing else, a good time can be had marveling at the rosy incandescence that Streep shares with her daughter Mamie Gummer , who plays Lila as a young woman. It's not yet clear what kind of an actress Gummer will beas the bride, she has little to do but make cow eyes at a man who isn't her groom. But she has one big thing going for her: Like her famous ma, she's unquenchably lit from within.
