 If Kimberly Roberts, the dynamo at the center of the documentary “Trouble the Water,” wasn’t a big woman with a great big mouth, her video images of Hurricane Katrina and the floodwaters that washed away her world in 2005 might have ended up as just another pixelated smear on YouTube. Happily for her and the rest of us, the filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin, both of whom have done time working with Michael Moore, realized that Ms. Roberts was a dream of a documentary subject. She didn’t just fill the frame with her outsize personality and outlaw swagger, she also shook it up with raw images of snatched, saved and lost lives.  Ms. Roberts didn’t wait out the storm from her home in the Lower Ninth Ward; she chased it. Roaming her neighborhood on foot and bicycle, she videotaped the gathering dark clouds and her stranded neighbors with a newly bought camera, watching with mounting concern as the drizzle grew into a deluge. Her rough, untutored camerawork has an ugliness and urgency that only add to the escalating sense of chaos and unease. As her sightlines roughly shift from one fugitive image to the next — wary adults, giggly children, nervous dogs, a stop sign that will soon be almost entirely under water — you can feel the pressure of the moment. Excitement courses through her free-ranging chatter and the palsied, swerving visuals.  Ms. Roberts and her husband, Scott Roberts, a man with a gentle smile and a long, thin scar grooved into a cheek, made it out of their rickety attic alive, along with some neighbors. They also made their way to a Red Cross shelter, where they met Mr. Deal and Ms. Lessin, yet another couple, though one on the prowl for a story, not salvation (in a way they got both). The filmmakers had flown from New York to Louisiana intending to follow National Guard troops who, in returning from Iraq, had left one disaster for another. A mouthpiece for the National Guard shut down their access, but before the storm chasers could pack up, Ms. Roberts pounced, asking if they wanted a look at what she had caught on video.  Mr. Deal and Ms. Lessin jumped in turn and began following after these gregarious refugees, tagging alongside the Robertses and their sad-eyed new friend, Brian, also from the Lower Ninth, including to Tennessee. There one of Ms. Roberts’s hosts tearfully vows that her son, who has thoughts of joining the Army, will not fight for a country that seems to have forgotten its black and its poor. Ms. Roberts, who often puts her faith in God but tends to take matters into her own capable hands, expresses little anger at the government. She isn’t especially at peace with her country, just resigned, so much so that she almost shrugs when she delivers the movie’s most devastating line, saying it felt as if “we lost our citizenship.”  That’s about as on-message as the movie gets, though of course Katrina itself carries the stench of politics, as a clip of a dazed-looking Michael D. Brown, who was then director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, affirms. Save for some righteous indignation at the close, “Trouble the Water” makes its points without didacticism, perhaps guided by the Robertses, who are interested in surviving, not grandstanding. That’s true even weeks after the storm, when they, Brian and the filmmakers return to New Orleans, where the streets are clogged with mud and debris. A dead dog rots in the sun, and inside one shabby home the body of Ms. Roberts’s uncle bloats in the heat. She goes inside, while the camera idles behind at a respectful distance.  Ms. Roberts is such a charismatic figure that she might have overwhelmed this movie. But Mr. Deal and Ms. Lessin have the big picture in mind, not just a personal portrait. Working with the editors T. Woody Richman and Mary Lampson, they have created an ingeniously fluid narrative structure that, when combined with Ms. Roberts’s visuals, news material and their own original 16-millimeter film footage, ebbs and flows like great drama. The early part of the movie is dominated by the Robertses’ seeking higher ground in their home as the water rises from street to porch and beyond, while the remainder follows them as they sift through the storm’s wake, searching for a new start in a city that has all but shut down.  Though her street savvy helped her survive natural and unnatural disasters, it was a familiar love of the camera that turned Ms. Roberts, an aspiring musician, into a documentary star. (That’s her rapping over the final credits under her nom de hip-hop, Black Kold Madina.) As it does for a lot of young Americans — she is 24 when the movie opens — being in front of a camera seems perfectly natural to her, something close to a generational birthright. Left motherless and impoverished during adolescence, she had probably been looking for attention for a long time.  It took the sight of poor and black Americans desperately waving for help from rooftops and bridges, though, before she received her close-up. I just hope this movie gives her more than 15 minutes.

A survivor of Hurricane Katrina gets it all on camera in �Trouble the Water,� a blend of DIY footage and filming by co-directors Tia Lessin and Carl Deal that considers the impact and aftermath of the New Orleans catastrophe from the perspective of a family that stayed at home during the storm. Though tinged with the sheer gumption and personal resolve of amateur vidmaker and would-be rapper Kimberly Roberts, this is ultimately a minor doc contribution to the bulging library of Katrina-related films and TV reports. Roberts� own material will be the major selling point, with buyers in cable arena more likely than theatrical. 
Lessin and Deal have worked in producer capacities with Michael Moore on �Fahrenheit 9/11� and �Bowling for Columbine,� but they studiously avoid any of Moore�s worst tendencies and take themselves out of the picture, allowing Roberts to tell a good deal of her own story. 
Pic�s first two-thirds alternates between Roberts� shaky but engaging  homevid leading up to, and during, the hurricane and levee failure, and Lessin and Deal�s footage of her and husband Scott returning to check on their home in a hard-hit neighborhood a mere three blocks from a levee break on the city�s Industrial Canal.
Roberts shows neighbors stocking up on groceries at the local mom �n� pop market prior to the storm, and her persistent filming documents the darkening sky, growing wind and rising water (topping the street�s nearby stop sign), with her family retreating to their attic. 
Neighbor Larry Simms, whom Scott disliked before the hurricane, comes to their rescue with a boxing bag as a flotation device. Roberts� vid reps some of the more extensive by any Katrina survivor, though the most disturbing clip is Lessin and Deal recording Scott�s account of being barred, at gunpoint, from emergency housing on a nearby naval base.
The storm�s aftermath is much more erratically assembled and told, leaving several gaps in the story of how the Roberts managed to get out of the city, to their relatives upstate, on to Memphis, where they hoped to rebuild their lives, and finally returning to New Orleans to re-establish themselves a year later. 
Roberts, a woman filled with moxie who describes her drug-addled past and how she escaped from it, also manages to get her rap songs prominently placed in the film. Scott, who also used to live the drug life, is last seen working with a crew rebuilding homes in devastated areas. 
Decision to cut back and forth in time, under T. Woody Richman�s editing, loses its dramatic impact after awhile, and finally becomes more confusing than it�s worth. Massive Attack�s Robert del Naja and Neil Davidge provide a rather pointless score, since the images on screen do the work themselves. 


Hurricane Katrina  may have driven off a large segment of New Orleans' African-American population. But in one sense the deadly storm was a uniter, not a divider: The devil wind brought together much of the country in contempt of the Bush administration's loose definition of humanitarian aid. Fresh as a slap, the outrage of Katrina's mishandling comes flooding back in Trouble the Water , a documentary account so starkly surreal that at times it seems wrought from another century's folklore.
Trouble the Water  bears roughly the same relation to Spike Lee 's kaleidoscopic When the Levees Broke  that a talking-blues dispatch has to a David McCullough  history. The topic may be the same, but the scope is personal rather than monumental. Yet by following a husband and wife from New Orleans' stricken Ninth Ward through the flood and its aftermath—most memorably in their own camcorder footage—the movie becomes an eyewitness epic of history in miniature.
The opening montage is faces, the displaced of New Orleans; the soundtrack ping-pongs news bites (President Bush : "I don't think anybody anticipated the breach of the levees . . . ") and rebuttals (faceless newsman: "For years, officials have warned the levees could  break . . . "). Inside a shelter are Scott and Kimberly Roberts . Tall, genial, and soft-spoken, Scott shyly flashes a grill of gold teeth. Kimberly is his opposite in brashness, a would-be rapper and amateur videographer. She's the one who kept a camcorder running as the storm bore down on the Gulf Coast. "I'm not leavin' 'cause I can't afford to," she says flatly.
The first and most gripping half of Trouble the Water , directed by Carl Deal  and Tia Lessin , is essentially a first-person disaster movie—history captured in the visual grammar of Cloverfield . Driven just to get it down ("I'll be able to tell the story"), Kimberly aims her palm-sized camera at her backyard, at the neighbor passed out on his porch, at the kids laughing off the storm warnings in the street. A dog whimpers, an Army truck creeps by, the sky fades to gray, a drizzle begins. Those cunning directors who've turned shaky-cam mock-vérité into a horror-movie cliché waste a lot of effort planting such "stray" details; they don't have the thing that gives Kimberly's footage its eerie force—genuine uncertainty about what's going to happen.
Then we watch as the water rises. And rises. In one of the movie's periodic cutaways to the outside world, President Bush addresses New Orleans from the trenches at the El Mirage RV Resort & Country Club in Arizona, reassuring the soon-to-be-submerged that "America will pray." (It's one of the few moments that tips off the filmmakers' production background with Michael Moore .) The couple is forced upstairs, atop their piled belongings. When the electricity goes out, with it goes every last vestige of the 21st century.
What Greil Marcus  called "the old weird America" rolls in with the floodwaters. News of the outside world arrives from a friend, Brian Nobles , who floats in on a punching bag; a stranger paddles down the street in a washtub. High water everywhere, indeed—life is suddenly a Charley Patton  song, or Big Bill Broonzy recounting the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 in "Southern Flood Blues": "Hey my house started shakin', went on floatin' on down the stream/It was dark as midnight, people began to holler and scream."
It gets weirder once the Roberts make their way outside the city to shelter, only to return weeks later to a deserted Ninth Ward that's purest Beckett: a ghostscape patrolled by lost dogs and warily accommodating National Guardsmen, where the surest sign of neighbors is the stink of death. In "Louisiana 1927," Randy Newman  captured the warp of cataclysm in a single mysterious line—"What has happened down here is the winds have changed"—and this new New Orleans is a zombie double with bared teeth. Those who seek shelter at a largely vacant naval base are reportedly turned away at gunpoint. The soldiers get presidential commendation; the residents get wet.
The second half finds the Roberts after they've rode 220 miles in a moving truck with 30 other people, seeking refuge with Kimberly's Uncle Jerome in Alexandria , Louisiana. This section doesn't have the staggering otherworldliness of the Katrina footage, just a slowly deepening ache as the Roberts learn the extent of the devastation and the runaround on FEMA  disaster aid. Most heartbreaking of all, Jerome's mother was among the patients who didn't get evacuated from New Orleans' Memorial Medical Center  and were left to die as the water rose. Two weeks later, Jerome still doesn't have her body.
The resilience of the movie's subjects—survivors of street crime and drugs and HIV—irradiates Trouble the Water  like sunshine. Kimberly's explosive rap provides the kind of balm that the blues gave to the untold thousands of Southern blacks displaced in the 1920s: This, too, is the story of a diaspora. But that only makes its closing post-Katrina update sting harder: billions in federal aid never disbursed; thousands of livable residences demolished; much of the city's African-American population scattered, never to return. Perhaps worst of all, the levees remain vulnerable, as do the city's poor. "Pray that you all don't have to go back to Iraq —it's not our war," Brian cautions some soldiers on the ground in the Ninth Ward. "This is the war, right here."
