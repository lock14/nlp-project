Elle Fanning gives a luminous, almost transparent performance as a troubled 9-year-old girl in "Phoebe in Wonderland." As an actress, she's dreamier and less forceful than her older sister Dakota  - more like an actual kid  - and the movie's halfway over before you realize how many contradictory emotions she's summoning up. God knows what they feed these girls for breakfast  - Cream of Streep?
The movie itself is an alternately inspired and awkward domestic drama that agonizes over the difference between a "special" child and one who may need actual professional help. At 9, Phoebe (Fanning) has a ripe imagination, but she washes her hands too much and drifts helplessly into little rituals that are disturbing even to her. Her mother (Felicity Huffman, doing solid work despite a horrifying wig) guilt-trips that she's a bad mom; dad Bill Pullman hides behind his work; little sister Olivia (Bailee Madison) is fed up with having to be the normal one.
To the rescue  - for a while, at least  - comes Miss Dodger (Patricia Clarkson), the spooky new drama teacher who casts Phoebe as Alice in the school's "Wonderland" play and who bonds with her over the difficulties of being young, female, and different. With her black dresses and eerie calm, Miss Dodger comes across like performance artist Laurie Anderson in charge of fourth grade, and the scenes of her playing head-trips on her smug young students are the sharpest moments here.
Phoebe's demons aren't so easily laid to rest, though, and much of the drama is in her fraught mother's attempts to cope. Do you label such a child with diagnoses or hope she'll come through? Do you medicate her personality away or ride the waves of disorder? "Phoebe in Wonderland" is partly produced by the Lifetime network and it has its therapy-drama side. Just as often, though, writer-director Daniel Barnz gets on the privileged wavelength of a girl who's not like others and can't understand why.
And Fanning goes all the way down the rabbit hole, letting Phoebe's wrenching fears well up through her face and body language. It's a guileless performance that's not the least bit actressy, and it leaves most of the other child performers looking vaguely dull-witted.
In fairness, most of the secondary roles are thinly written (including Campbell Scott's pettifogging principal), and the first-time feature director should have been harder on his own script. "Phoebe in Wonderland" gradually loses its grip on tone and believability, climaxing with a show-must-go-on moment that's just plain silly. Thankfully, Barnz knows exactly where to end his film: on the face of a girl, and an actress, at the crossroads.

As the gifted and troubled Phoebe, who lands the lead role in her grade-school production of Alice in Wonderland , Elle Fanning proves as coyly precocious as her older sister, Dakota  that is, she's charming and annoying at the same time. Phoebe appears to have obsessive-compulsive disorder (or something), but Phoebe in Wonderland  is so intent on celebrating her as ''special'' that it quirks up the trauma of her issues. As the school drama teacher who tries to unlock ''the real,'' Patricia Clarkson makes high theatrical solemnity funny.

 “Phoebe in Wonderland,” a tremblingly sensitive family drama that decomposes in  its last half-hour, examines the difference between the growing pains of a gifted child and the possibility of more serious mental illness. When  9-year-old Phoebe Lichten (Elle Fanning) auditions to play Alice in a school production of “Alice in Wonderland,” childish superstition drives her to act out self-punishing rituals to earn the part. In one she repeatedly washes her hands until they are raw. Another involves executing painstakingly counted-out dance steps on the sidewalk without landing on a crack.  Phoebe, who wins the role, becomes the pet of the drama teacher, Miss Dodger (Patricia Clarkson), a fierce defender of alienated, artistically inclined children. When Jamie (Ian Colletti), the boy chosen to play the Queen of Hearts, finds a homophobic epithet sprayed on his costume, Miss Dodger sternly lectures the children on the honorable history of men playing women in Shakespeare’s time. Her speech rings as the personal screed of the filmmaker Daniel Barnz, who makes his feature writing and directing debut with “Phoebe in Wonderland.”  The girl’s mother, Hillary (Felicity Huffman), who is turning her  doctoral thesis on “Alice in Wonderland” into a book, worries that Phoebe is resentful of  the time she spends on the book. But as Phoebe increasingly gets lost in daydreams in which the people in her life become figures out of “Alice in Wonderland,” her behavior signals deeper problems. She injures herself making a daredevil leap from a catwalk above the stage; in a fit of pique she spits at a fellow student.  This is a movie whose adult male characters —  Phoebe’s father, Peter (Bill Pullman);  her principal, Mr. Davis (Campbell Scott);  and Dr. Miles (Peter Gerety), the ineffectual psychiatrist she visits —  are well-meaning, clueless dolts. It is up to women to save the day.  Ms. Clarkson’s drama teacher appears to be the movie’s mouthpiece for creativity and self-expression until she refers to everyday people as “horrible normals,” and the balance between supportive teacher and irresponsible enabler tips toward the latter. (Ms. Clarkson, whose character exudes an air of mysterious knowingness, is, as usual, wonderful.)  The aching maternal concern Ms. Huffman brings to her “Desperate Housewives” character, Lynette Scavo, is amplified to self-lacerating anguish in “Phoebe in Wonderland” as her empathy fails to soothe her daughter. As Phoebe, Ms. Fanning, completely refraining from melodrama or show business cuteness, gives a touching, subtle portrayal of a troubled child. When this smart, pretty, imaginative, emotionally stricken little girl fearfully admits she is unable to control her self-destructive compulsions, you feel for her.  But at a certain point “Phoebe in Wonderland” throws up its hands as though at a loss of where to go next or what to say. Phoebe is given a label, Tourette’s syndrome, for one aspect of her behavior, but it seems more like a symptom than a diagnosis. Here, the movie collapses on itself.  Miss Dodger has abruptly and mysteriously disappeared. The children take charge of the school production, and suddenly they burst into an inane production number that suggests something out of a bad Disney musical; this is odd, seeing as the play wasn’t conceived as a musical.  Soon after that the movie simply stops dead in its tracks, as though the  money had run out and the project had been called off in the middle of a scene that makes no psychological or dramatic sense. It leaves you frustrated and annoyed.  “Phoebe in Wonderland”  is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some strong language.

Elle Fanning starrer �Phoebe in Wonderland� is a live-action entry in the little-girl-fantasy genre that, like the puppet-animated �Coraline� (toplining Fanning�s sister Dakota), stresses both the wonders and the terrors of the imagination. Phoebe is differently enabled -- also beautiful, wistful and fey, as portrayed by Fanning. Whenever tyro writer-director Daniel Barnz sticks to his luminous star, his script�s blatant inconsistency reads as willful ambiguity. Whenever he vainly fleshes out Phoebe�s reality/fantasy axis, the unfocused pic founders in bathetic whimsy. Pic grossed $26,111 in its 11-screen debut over the weekend.
Nine-year-old Phoebe suffers from Tourette syndrome, a fact coyly unrevealed until the pic�s denouement; the filmmaker, apparently, is as reluctant as Phoebe�s mother (Felicity Huffman) to accept �reductive� labels (though once Phoebe is pigeonholed, she can smilingly show-and-tell her disease in class). The syndrome manifests itself at school in antisocial behavior of a remarkably genteel bent (rarely has spitting been accomplished with such a minimum of phlegm and a maximum of provocation), and at home in more serious, self-destructive rituals, leaving Phoebe with night terrors and bloody hands and knees.
Phoebe is given the lead role in a school production of �Alice in Wonderland,� ringmastered by a quaintly garbed, �Jabberwocky�-spouting drama teacher (Patricia Clarkson). This unleashes a scattershot barrage of quotes, cheesy hallucinations, circular pans and archly pretentious�Wonderland� comparisons (with Phoebe�s shrink, played by Peter Gerety, recast as a lamely costumed Humpty Dumpty), the already tenuous lines between reality and fantasy blurrily evaporating.  
In �Heavenly Creatures,� �Coraline� or the peerless �Pan�s Labyrinth,� a girl�s entrance into a parallel universe symbolizes a deep sea change into something rich and strange; here, it signals a mishmash of motley agendas and trendy causes that contradict themselves.  
Partly produced by Lifetime, the pic attempts to elevate the disease-of-the-week movie into a moral dialectic between conformity and imagination. Political correctness -- the view of mental illness as an extension of normal behavior -- trumps any narrative logic. Thus, Barnz arbitrarily posits a nonsensical series of school �rules� to embody conformity, while imagination is repped by Tourette syndrome.
For extra credit, Barnz throws in simplistically overwrought feminism: Huffman shrilly complains of the difficulty of reconciling work and motherhood, while Bill Pullman�s uninspired turn as Phoebe�s dad adds a touch of male cluelessness to the mix. Indeed, few adult actors manage to overcome the pic�s skewed point-making, Campbell Scott�s hilarious spin on a babbling, responsibility-avoiding principal being a notable exception.
This sorry straggler from last year�s Sundance Film Festival peaks with a wince-worthy New Age update of Andy Hardy, as Phoebe�s playmates learn the value of individuality by rote repetition of �I�m responsible!,� capped by a musical number of staggering unoriginality.



Nine-year-old Phoebe Lichten (Elle Fanning ) is every parent's dream and nightmare—a talented child for whom school presents few challenges, but also a troubled girl prone to flights of fancy and self-abuse. She cannot process the real world, in which she finds no "hope," so instead loses herself in a make-believe one: Wonderland, courtesy of the drama teacher (Patricia Clarkson ), who encourages the lost little kid to "jump" lest she suffer a more brutal fall. And yet, even as Alice wandering a magical kingdom, Phoebe's condition deteriorates; her parents, writers played by Felicity Huffman  and Bill Pullman , find it easier to blame themselves than to allow outsiders (shrinks, principals, drama teachers) to interpret the source of Phoebe's anguish. A Lifetime Network production, writer-director Daniel Barnz 's film is profoundly stirring, if also occasionally maddening; its excursions into whimsy (Phoebe in conversation with the Mad Hatter and Red Queen, say) are clumsy, like scenes from Coraline  injected into a far more serious drama about the fine line between illumination and despair. Yet the performances are transcendent—especially Fanning's, as the little girl who wants to get better, who wants to be better, as she slowly disappears through the Looking Glass.
