This Sundance prizewinner is a journalistic saga of immigration directed with a thriller's physicality by Cary Joji Fukunaga. Casper  (Flores) has long been a member of the Mara, a cutthroat cult of Mexican youths who wear so many scary tattoos, they're like the Maori of the barrio. He ends up on the run, joining a group of immigrants who are traveling, literally, atop a train while seeking passage into the U.S. They include Sayra  (Gaitan), a Honduran teenager who's the film's clear-eyed, one-note heroine. Whenever Sin Nombre  turns violent, it seizes you with its convulsive skill, but the film's images   vastly outstrip its imagination. B–

 The caressing, honeyed light in “Sin Nombre” beautifies and softens every ugly moment in this equivocating (inspirational  yet hard-boiled) story about geographic and moral border crossings. Written and directed by the young American Cary Joji Fukunaga making his feature debut, the film comes with a veritable certificate of authenticity: it was shot  in Mexico and is performed in Spanish by Latin American actors.  The credits are also in Spanish, including the  information that the project was “developed with the assistance of the Sundance Institute Feature Film Program,”  an acknowledgment of its truer, more complex provenance.  In brief, “Sin Nombre” — “without  name” in Spanish — tracks two parallel journeys that inevitably meet, brought together after a fatal encounter. The first, by far liveliest  voyage begins in the chaos of Tapachula in Chiapas,  Mexico,  where Casper (Edgar Flores), a teenage member of the vicious street gang  Mara Salvatrucha, is making a fast run toward an early grave. Casper meets his destiny when his story collides with that of Sayra (Paulina Gaitan), a solemn-eyed, none-too-sharp Honduran teenager who is riding the rails to Texas with her father and uncle.   The teenagers meet cute, gangsta style, when another Salvatrucha member attacks her during a heist on the train and is assaulted in turn.  The real Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, has a wretched, perverse history: the gang is thought to have been  started  in the 1980s in Los Angeles by Salvadoran immigrants whose families had fled the civil war in their country, a war partly paid for by the United States. The decentralized gang soon branched out, infiltrating most of the rest of the United States. And then, after members were deported to their native country, it spread  beyond Central America, taking its brand of street terrorism transnational. You don’t learn any of this in “Sin Nombre,” despite the film’s veneer of (gritty yet lovingly lighted) realism. Mr. Fukunaga may have traveled through Mexico  to research  the  film, but he hasn’t strayed far from Hollywood to tell his tale.  To that end, “Sin Nombre,” despite its location shooting and unnerving glimpses into the Mara Salvatrucha, unwinds exactly like any number of movies juiced up by graphic violence and hinged to ritualistic redemption: terrible things happen, but the bad times and vibes are nominally assuaged by some final-act uplift.  Thus Casper suffers horribly because of the Mara Salvatrucha, whose vile rituals get plenty of screen time, including the gang initiation of his 12-year-old  friend Smiley (Kristyan Ferrer). Members need to be baptized in blood to join, and so Smiley puts a bullet in  a tied-up, whimpering gang rival, who is then — cut to the shot of a bowl of coarsely chopped raw meat — fed to the gang’s dogs.  What is objectionable about this scene isn’t its shock value — there’s a similar, more unsettling dog-eats-man scene in Johnnie To’s great mob movie “Election II” — it’s how the violence is exploited within the context of the story. In “Election II,” the man-is-meat scene underscores the essential moral rot of the mobsters, whom Mr. To refuses to sentimentalize. In “Sin Nombre,” the guy is fed to the dogs both to titillate the audience (hence the shot of the dog bowl) and to show the look of disgust on Casper’s face. His revulsion is critical, because without it he wouldn’t be as likable — character likability is a creative imperative as much in Sundance as in Hollywood — which  makes him more like a person and less like a screenwriting conceit.  However street,  Casper is as sentimentalized a fiction as one of those dirty-faced angels who ran around studio back lots in the 1930s, and his means of salvation, Sayra, isn’t any  better. The roads they travel and hardships they endure are finally narrative arcs, calibrated for maximum drama, excitement and entertainment. What keeps the movie from tipping into full-blown exploitation like “City of God,” which turns third-world misery into art-house thrills, is Mr. Fukunaga’s sincerity. What keeps you watching is his superb eye. Working with his cinematographer,  Adriano Goldman,  he fills in the cracks of his story with moments of beauty — children tossing oranges up to the train, Casper sleeping under a canopy of trees — that make you want to see what comes next.  “Sin Nombre” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Extreme violence throughout.

A big new talent arrives on the scene with �Sin nombre.� Writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga�s enthralling feature debut takes viewers into a shadow world inhabited by many but noticed by very few -- that of Central American migrants making the perilous trip through Mexico to get to the United States border. Shot on extraordinary locations with a capable unknown cast, this Focus Features release will stir considerable interest for its artistic and social aspects and has dual commercial potential in art/specialized release and in the Spanish-language market.
In the most positive sense, this is the quintessential Sundance movie, the sort of film that institute organizers might have dreamed about when they launched Sundance�s Latin American outreach years ago and began inviting a wide range of aspiring filmmakers to its labs. Fukunaga had his prize-winning short, �Victoria para Chino,� shown at the 2005 Sundance fest and has participated in both the writing and directing labs in addition to being enrolled in the NYU graduate film program.
But many others have gone that route without showing anything like the command Fukunaga displays with the camera, his actors and storytelling. If there are 8 million stories in the Naked City, there are millions more involving the recent massive migration of souls from South to North, of which �Sin nombre� is one sad, wrenching and violent example.
�Sin nombre� differs vastly from previous films about immigrants in that its focus is on the problems facing them before they get anywhere near the U.S. One story strand centers on members of the Mara Salvatrucha gang in Tapachula, Chiapas, in southern Mexico. Tough teen Casper (Edgar Flores), aka Willy, brings scrappy 12-year-old Smiley (Kristyan Ferrer) into the fold for a brutal initiation, which first involves being beaten to a pulp and then killing an enemy.
Secretly, Casper has a hot thing going with the foxy Martha Marlene (Diane Garcia), but his occasional disappearances arouse the suspicions of gang leader Lil� Mago (Tenoch Huerta Mejia), an amazing character whose entire face is covered with dense tattoos. Detailed scenes of communal gang life in its grungy compound convey not only the ever-present threat of violence but a sense of belonging otherwise absent in the lives of urchins like Smiley.
In Honduras, another teenager, Sayra (Paulina Gaitan), sees little choice but to join her long-absent father and uncle in a move to New Jersey. The three make an arduous jungle trek to Guatemala and across the river to Mexico to hop a freight train to the northern border. Stunning are the scenes of hordes of people waiting near the tracks, then clambering to the tops of the cars at night to ride hundreds of miles exposed to the elements; Fukunaga and lenser Adriano Goldman�s low angle perspectives make the trains look ominous and enormous; here, as elsewhere in the picture, the you-are-there aspect is intense.
Yarn�s two threads intersect atop the train when Lil� Mago forces the errant Casper and Smiley to join him in robbing the largely defenseless voyagers. When the easily agitated gang boss, who has already dispatched Martha from Casper�s life, arbitrarily assaults Sayra, Casper hacks him with his machete and tosses him off the train. With this act, he earns Sayra�s profound gratitude and perhaps more; it also makes him a marked man.
Casper foolishly sends Smiley back home, which means the long arm of Mara revenge extends itself very quickly. Narratively, the film�s second half has the contours of a Hitchcockian thriller in which a man and woman who scarcely know each other go on the run from killers. But while tension accompanies every step of their trip as Casper and Sayra make their way toward the Rio Grande, Fukunaga refrains from artificially amping up excitement for its own sake, maintaining an intimate, observational style that offers up a host of things to look at and think about.
Injected with brilliant colors and great mobility, the film�s widescreen images are exceptionally vibrant. Interesting detail -- gang habits and mores, the absence of visible institutions and authority, the not falsely ennobled stoicism of the characters -- abounds, and great technical skill has been brought to bear in all departments to bring off a project that cannot have been easy to mount.
Performances by the young leading players are uniformly engaging without trying to be ingratiating. Flores� Casper is a tough kid who would likely drift away from the Mara to pursue a more normal life if given half a chance, while through Ferrer�s impressionable Smiley, one sees how the gang iconography and discipline cast a spell, just as dazzling externals helped the Nazis and other odious regimes to hypnotize youth.
As Sayra, Gaitan has a quiet, warm, undemonstrative presence that slowly draws you in, much as Catalina Sandino Moreno did in �Maria Full of Grace� and Ashley Judd many years ago in �Ruby in Paradise.� Garcia glows as the doomed Martha, while Huerta Mejia and Luis Fernando Pena as the gangland successor convey credible menace.
Marcelo Zarvos� score provides a complex, unusual musical backdrop. 


Before setting pen to paper, Sin Nombre  writer-director Cary Joji Fukunaga  purportedly rode the rails in the company of real illegal immigrants traveling from Mexico to the U.S. But from the looks of it, he spent even more time studying Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles 's slicked-up slum porn City of God : diminutive kids with guns-check; carefully lit and art-directed shantytowns-check; doomed teen romance-yep, that too. In fairness, Fukunaga's film isn't quite as ostentatiously vulgar as Meirelles's: Its loftier aspirations are obvious from the opening shot of El Casper (Edgar Flores ), a young initiate in the fact-based Mara Salvatrucha  gang, staring fixedly at a photo enlargement of a leafy wooded landscape-a signal flare (along with his teardrop tattoo) that he's really a soulful poet-dreamer trapped in a violent existence. After his girlfriend is raped and murdered by the gang's more elaborately tattooed leader, Casper makes a break for it, hopping the same U.S.-bound freight train on which Honduran teen Sayra (Paulina Gaitan ) and her father are heading to the promised land. Meanwhile, Casper's best friend, Smiley (pint-sized Kristian Ferrer ), is dispatched to track the fugitive down-hmmm, do you think these two amigos  will find their personal loyalty tested by obeisance to La Mara? Lushly photographed and meticulously sound-designed, Sin Nombre  is visceral without being vital, researched without ever seeming lived-in. The best that can be said is that it's a more honest film on the subject of immigration than the recent Crossing Over -but then again, so is Beverly Hills Chihuahua .
