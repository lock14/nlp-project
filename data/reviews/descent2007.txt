         Depending on your revenge story preferences, the brutally pretentious "Descent" is either a payback flick with an agonizingly formless middle, or a soul-darkening head trip bracketed by a crude vengeance tale. Mostly, though, it's indie provocation trapped between shock and blah.
 
 Initially, the story is an all-too-familiar one: smart, boy-wary female college student trusts the wrong frat guy. Maya (Rosario Dawson) may not see what is unfortunately obvious for any seasoned moviegoer -- that persistent wooer Jared (Chad Faust) is a shifty creep -- but it doesn't diminish the real-time ugliness of the sexual violence Jared commits after a date of wine, food and psychoanalytic smooth talk.
 


         






   Where "Descent" earns its title as a creative omen is in its aftermath drama, in which first-time feature director Talia Lugacy (who co-wrote the movie with Brian Priest) chooses hyper-stylized movie affectations over the vivid human details of a rape's aftermath. Instead we get an incoherent, blackout-hued slog through an underworld club scene where a drifting, dead-eyed Maya befriends a ripped, tattooed and protective  DJ named Adrian (Marcus Patrick), who digs his  dance floor power.
 
 Newly empowered by this proximity to a different kind of punishing male power, Maya enters  Act 3 -- I mean, the fall term -- armed with gruesome, table-turning plans for Jared straight out of a penitentiary handbook. Lugacy has no intention of making the unflinching final 10 minutes of "Descent" a revenger's paradise: Never has a beautifully framed solitary tear on a woman's cheek seemed so ham-fistedly accusatory. We get it: payback at what cost? Rather than a multifaceted take on a woman abused and rebuilt, "Descent" presents Dawson as a victimized pawn in a muddle.

 Rape is power.  “Descent” — starring Rosario Dawson as Maya, a college student who survives a sexual assault — makes this vividly clear, dramatizing the experience and the psychological aftermath of rape with a vividness I’ve never seen in an American film.  The attacker is someone Maya knows: a former pianist turned second-string football player named Jared (the goofy but rakishly charming Chad Faust). Jared flirts with Maya at a party one spring, doting on her for her mixed-race beauty and eventually convincing her to go on a date that ends in a candlelit, makeshift love shack in the basement of his apartment building.  The ordeal is over in minutes. Maya doesn’t report it. But she spends the following summer sitting on a mother lode of rage  that will be unleashed in the film’s finale,  a prolonged retaliatory assault  in which Maya transforms her pain into sadistic pleasure and sinks to Jared’s level.  The first-time feature filmmaker Talia Lugacy — who attended the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute with Ms. Dawson and collaborated with her on short films — is committed to exploring the psychic aftershocks of Maya’s rape and its effect on her senses of autonomy, sexuality and ethnic identity. All three are symbolically annihilated by Jared, who ravages her while grunting sexist and racist epithets in her ear.  This last aspect — the rape’s awakening of Maya’s consciousness as a woman of color — elevates “Descent” beyond case study and into the realm of bomb-throwing polemic. Maya’s personality is transformed during visits to a dance club, where she falls for a macho  African-American  D.J. named Adrian (the musician turned actor Marcus Patrick, who has a bit of Burt Lancaster’s looming physicality), experiments with drugs and tries to reclaim the sexual confidence that Jared  stole. (The latter is suggested rather than shown, in a strobe-lit dance floor montage of Maya writhing with several partners.)  The attack radicalizes Maya in ways that are not immediately apparent because Ms. Dawson — whose intricate, imaginative performance equals those of Robert De Niro in “Taxi Driver” and Hilary Swank in “Boys Don’t Cry” — expresses them through eddies of sadness and rage that we can sense, even though they remain hidden from other characters.  It also shatters Maya’s illusion that she can go through life being judged by her intelligence and character rather than her beauty, gender and skin tone. This seeps in as she spends time with Adrian, a surly hunk who volunteers bits of street wisdom, playfully mimes smacking Maya and bullies a white sycophant who’s in love with Adrian’s talent and his blackness.  While hanging with Adrian, Maya learns the pleasures of intimidation, illustrated in a scene in which Adrian commands the sycophant to smoke a cigarette clenched between Maya’s toes. In moments like this it becomes clear that “Descent” — which was written by Ms. Lugacy and her cousin Brian Priest — is not just about the personal experience of rape, but rape as a metaphor for sexual, racial and cultural dominance, and the inadequacy of cruelty as a response.  This last point is illustrated in Maya’s retaliation against Jared. I won’t describe it here, partly to avoid spoiling a grim surprise, and partly because its Grand Guignol particulars resist euphemism. Suffice to say that it makes the violence in Gaspar Noé’s “Irréversible” seem tame, and that it simultaneously echoes Amiri Baraka’s racial powder-keg play “Dutchman” and the “Sopranos” episode “Employee of the Month” (which ended with a rape victim refusing a chance at revenge).  Astonishingly, though, the film’s brutality never plays like a stunt, thanks to Ms. Dawson’s revelatory performance and Ms. Lugacy’s adventurous direction (which includes lots of long takes and metaphorically apt compositions). Hard to watch but essential to see, “Descent” is at once realistic and rhetorical, and driven throughout by righteous anger that comes from an honest place.    “Descent” is rated NC-17  (No one under 17 admitted) for  brutal rape, graphic violence, profanity and drug use.

"We had faces then," Norma Desmond said in "Sunset Boulevard," but the fact is, we have faces now. Cate Blanchett, Hilary Swank and Uma Thurman are a few modern classics, and so is Rosario Dawson, who could have provided a 100-minute closeup and revealed more about human nature and anguish than all of "Descent," a rape-revenge fantasy that will have auds ankling after the first attack.
First attack? Oh, yes, and considering the one that follows, it seems the far milder of the two -- although to pass that kind of judgment is to get into the sexual-political morass "Descent" wants us to wade through.
A symposium in the "men are pigs" school of gender relations, "Descent" is about one young grad student's violation, metamorphosis and well-planned, gruesome revenge on her assailant -- in a scene which, if said assailant were a woman, would relegate the "Descent" DVD to the little back room at the videostore.
There's nothing pretty either, of course, about the initial attack on Maya (Dawson), a gifted scholar who's just getting her life together when she meets Jared (Chad Faust), the most arrogant preppie ever to get lost en route to a Wes Anderson movie. When flowers and sweet talk don't quite succeed, Jared resorts to handcuffs. What follows is horrible, despite the discreet camera angles and miserly lighting.
What happens next is anyone's guess: Maya, moving through life like the walking wounded, is near-comatose. She alienates her co-workers, who mistake her remoteness for snobbery and interpret her part-time carpentry job as an indication of lesbianism (the girl-on-girl vibe is certainly here, although, like many aspects of "Descent," it's rendered annoyingly indistinct). Strangely, Maya isn't damaged enough to stay out of the clubs, and one night on a dance floor, she meets Adrian (Marcus Patrick), a DJ who introduces her to an all-new world that transforms her, gives her confidence and sets her on a course of payback.
What takes place during this slower-than-snail-mail second act of "Descent"? Who knows? The entire resurrection sequence is so indulgently impressionistic and obscure as to be incoherent. Pic's message is the one thing that's made clear: A victim can sink lower than her predator. Whether receiving that message justifies the cost of watching "Descent' is another question.
Production values are good, particularly the cinematography of Christopher LaVasseur and Jonathan Furmanski, despite their working with so little light, the viewer often can't tell what's going on.

After 19-year-old Maya (Rosario Dawson ), intellectually gifted but emotionally bruised and guarded, is raped by fellow college student Jared (Chad Faust ), she pulls further inward, isolating herself with cinema's patented badge of post-sexual-assault anguish: a severe new haircut. Then, thanks to Adrian (Marcus Patrick)a magnetic, omnisexual pied piper of club life with a palpable dark vibe she falls into an escapist spiral of drugs and sex, a free fall that is artily rendered by writer-director Talia Lugacy . Descent  wants desperately to be a provocative tale of female revenge and the unexpected fallout not only from the rape it- self, but also its carefully plotted payback. That goal is short-circuited, however, by the fact that Descent  not a smart film: There are endless obvious omissions (does Maya tell anyonecops, family, her old roommateabout the rape?) and gaps in character logic that insult the audience's intelligence. There are also a handful of interesting momentsthe lesbo-erotic spark between Maya and her ex-roommate, Jared's unexpected reaction to his comeuppance but those are quickly discarded, leaving only a well-acted trifle straining to be a hard-hitting morality play.
