The Rwandan genocide of 1994 that left nearly a million Tutsi slaughtered surely deserves another good telling even after Hotel Rwanda  and Sometimes in April . And Beyond the Gates , with its lack of sentimentality, its tough criticism of U.N. inaction, and its cast and crew filled out with real survivors, does nicely. John Hurt is magnetic as a Catholic priest running a school where terrified Tutsi have taken refuge, while Hugh Dancy, as a naive teacher, represents white commitment to black Africa at its most impotent and unreliable. Stay for the credits; the coda is powerful.

 “Beyond the Gates,” a harrowing recounting of the 1994 Rwandan genocide, ends with an epigraph by Elie Wiesel that is worth pondering: “The opposite of faith is not heresy but indifference.”  As a feature film subject, that genocide can be spun into any number of thematic variations. The wrenching “Hotel Rwanda” (2004) was a contemporary African “Schindler’s List” in which a man of conscience risked everything to protect  more than a thousand Tutsi refugees from slaughter by bloodthirsty Hutu thugs. The heroism of the real-life Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle), the hotel manager who turned the elegant Hôtel des Mille Collines in the capital city, Kigali, into a refuge, left you hanging on a thread of hope. You could console yourself with the notion that after all is said and done, goodness and decency still flicker like candles in a distant window.  “Beyond the Gates,” which revisits many of the same events, was filmed on location using many survivors of the genocide as cast and crew. Though less reassuring and not as dramatically coherent as “Hotel Rwanda,” it still packs a hard punch. Instead of a luxury hotel, the refuge sought by 2,500 desperate Tutsis is the École Technique Officielle, a secondary school in Kigali  that also served as a headquarters for United Nations peacekeeping forces. When those troops eventually leave the country, the 2,500 refugees are left behind to fend for themselves.  The movie addresses two unrelated questions. The first —  why the West sat back as  the catastrophe  unfolded —  isn’t satisfactorily answered, although a peripheral character,  a BBC newswoman (Nicola Walker) who instructs a TV crew to videotape the butchery, suggests an answer. When she was in Bosnia, she recalls, she cried every day at the atrocities. Here, she observes, it’s “just dead Africans.”  The movie  goes further than its forerunner in dramatizing the stony attitude of the United Nations, embodied by Captain Delon (Dominique Horwitz), the implacably hard-nosed French leader of the peacekeeping forces who refuses to disobey orders and get involved, even after Hutus kill 10 Belgian soldiers. Their instructions are to shoot only when fired upon, he repeatedly emphasizes.  The United Nations forces, however, are allowed to shoot dogs sniffing hacked-up corpses outside the school’s gates, because the animals are thought to pose a health threat. When “Beyond the Gates” was released overseas, it had a different title: “Shooting Dogs.”  The second and deeper issue addressed by the film is the question of religious and spiritual faith in the face of genocide. What is true faith,  and how much horror does it take to erode it? Can a reasonable person still believe in God amid the slaughter of 800,000 people? Does reason have anything to do with it?  These questions are channeled through the consciences of two Britons, one religious, the other not. Father Christopher (John Hurt), a  world-weary Catholic priest who has worked in Africa for 30 years and preaches in a church at the school, is the man of faith. The other, Joe Connor (Hugh Dancy), is a young teacher, political idealist and do-gooder spending a year at the school. Between the two, there is no contest when it comes to courage and strength of character. Faith trumps mere altruism.  In the midst of carnage Father Christopher performs baptisms and preaches about God’s love. “God does not always like what we do, but he loves all of us,” he replies when confronted with the horrors around him. This initially infuriating character gains moral stature as the depth of his faith and his willingness to risk his life are revealed. Mr. Hurt, exuding equal measures of fortitude and sorrowful fatalism, has never been better.  Joe, outraged by the carnage and the refusal of anyone in authority to try to stop it, eventually meets the ultimate challenge: When all the whites in Kigali are evacuated by the French, he must decide whether to leave or remain to face probable death.  Joe appears to be the fictional alter ego of David Belton, a producer of the film, who collaborated on the story. Mr. Belton was a BBC correspondent  posted in Rwanda in 1994. In the production notes he is quoted voicing his guilt at leaving the country when he did: “In a sense the whole Rwandan genocide was about failure, and I wanted to focus on that,” he says. “I felt I had failed as a journalist.” The movie, directed by Michael Caton-Jones, might be taken as a belated act of contrition.  Unlike the more squeamish “Hotel Rwanda,” “Beyond the Gates” confronts the physical reality of mass slaughter in shots of city streets littered with hacked-up bodies. The scenes of Hutu militias  tooting whistles and dancing in an orgy of butchery are some of the most chilling depictions of vengeful mob madness ever filmed. Yet “Beyond the Gates” knows just how far to go without turning into a Mel Gibson bloodbath. Most of the actual killings take place out of the camera’s sight.  In the movie’s saddest moment a Tutsi tribesman pleads with Captain Delon to shoot them so they won’t be crudely butchered. He bluntly refuses.  “Beyond the Gates” falls short in many areas. It barely sketches the history of Hutu-Tutsi strife, ignores the role of Belgian colonists in stimulating simmering tribal hatred and leaves us to assume that the Hutus are fiends and the slaughtered Tutsis martyred saints. Good and evil are never as clear-cut as that.

Eleven years later, the Rwandan genocide continues to intrigue filmmakers, even if the full horror of the bloody events seems too demanding for many of them to confront. Although in many respects a more stylish, authentic, tougher-minded film than "Hotel Rwanda," director Michael Caton-Jones' respectable and well-intentioned "Shooting Dogs" still falls into the trap of filtering an inherently African story through the eyes of a noble white protagonist -- in this case, two of them. Given the wealth of cinematic material on a subject so unpleasant (including HBO's "Sometimes in April" and several excellent docus), pic is most like to reach an audience of politically-aware small-screen viewers.
Like the Hotel des Mille Collines that provided the inspiration for "Hotel Rwanda," the Ecole Technique Officielle was a real place -- a secondary school located in the capital city of Kigali that similarly came to serve as a makeshift shelter for Tutsis and moderate Hutus at the height of the killings. The school, which also served as base camp for a company of Belgian UN peacekeepers, came to harbor some 2,500 refugees until, some five days after the start of the genocide, the UN pulled its troops out of the school, consigning those left behind to the knowledge they would soon be killed.
Slightly fictionalized screenplay by David Wolstencroft unfolds through the eyes of Joe Connor (Hugh Dancy), a young British schoolteacher spending a year at the Ecole. There, he is taken under the wing of the avuncular Father Christopher (John Hurt), whose weary face fails to conceal the ethnic violence he has witnessed during his long African sojourn.
Pic's early sections do an accomplished job of mapping out the simmering tensions between Rwanda's Hutu and Tutsi factions: The bright Tutsi pupil, Marie (Claire-Hope Ashitey), to whom Joe has taken a particular liking, is teased and pelted by Hutu classmates, while the school's Hutu custodian (David Gyasi) is shown to be one of the many Rwandans whose sensibilities have been corrupted by the incessant hate propaganda of the infamous RTLM radio station. Location shooting in Kigali is also a major plus.
In many respects, the character of Joe seems a surrogate for "Shooting Dogs" producer and co-story writer David Belton, who was himself a BBC news cameraman on location in Rwanda in 1994 and who, in the pic's press notes, expresses a feeling of guilt over the speed with which he -- like nearly all other Americans and Europeans -- evacuated the country as soon as the going got tough. 
Exploring that guilt is certainly a worthy subject for a film. But as "Shooting Dogs" progresses, it turns into more of an exaltation of Joe and Father Christopher than a consideration of why the Western world was so quick to turn a blind eye to Rwanda. After a while, the nobility of the characters, and of the film itself, becomes stifling. In short, if "Hotel Rwanda" was a movie about 1,200 people who lived while nearly 1,000,000 others perished, "Shooting Dogs" is a movie about the two white men who stayed behind to help when all others fled. Aside from Marie, none of pic's African characters are developed in three dimensions. 
"Shooting Dogs" is unquestionably at its most compelling in its depiction of Father Christopher's steadfast reliance on spirituality, even when confronted with such a startling display of inhumanity. Even as the violence reaches its zenith, he continues to perform Mass and seems more concerned with making sure each child receives communion than in formulating a possible exit strategy. Yet the film stops short of becoming a full-bodied portrait of a clergyman in crisis, and too often falls back on by-now familiar images of carnage-strewn streets and corrupt government ministers.
With a drawn, harrowed face like a relief map of suffering, Hurt proves one of the pic's chief assets, as does newcomer Ashitey, though Dancy's performance rarely advances beyond one-note outrage. Despite its many shortcomings, pic benefits immeasurably from the fluidity of Caton-Jones' direction and the depth, texture and immediacy of d.p. Ivan Strasburg's lensing.

It's easy to sneer at the current vogue for movies bemoaning the agony of Africa, a continent whose troubles show up on our radar in large measure because they feed Hollywood 's gaping maw for action adventures set in exotic climes. However tainted by smelly motives, though, the best of such movies bring the irreplaceable urgency of the big screen to the mess of post-colonial Africa. Heaven knows, the story of Rwanda 's 1994 civil warin which hundreds of thousands of indigenous Tutsis were hacked to death while Western powers dickered over the precise definition of genocidebears endless repeating. Michael Caton-Jones 's Beyond the Gates  focuses on the massacre of 2,500 Tutsis at a Catholic school abandoned to its fate by U.N.  soldiers with orders to evacuate only Europeans. Though hobbled by its anxious impulse to teach history to an audience that by now surely knows the basic contours of Rwanda's tragedy, the script apportions blame where it belongs (on high), while leaving smaller fryincluding an admirably un-cute BBC  journalistdangling, however sympathetically, on the hook.
