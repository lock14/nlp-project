Charlize Theron is well on her way to being the queen mother of a peculiar type of suffering. She seems fully committed to a career of wet, bloodshot eyes, snotty noses, and a mouth that's always pulled down at the corners. "The Yards," "Monster," "North Country," "In the Valley of Elah," or even "The Italian Job": These are unhappy, unsavory, and variously unstable women under siege and striking out against or suffocating inside a man's world.
I don't know whether what Theron is doing constitutes feminism (probably), an on-going commitment to turn herself inside out (for sure), or both. But she's in the process of giving us a gallery of poor, American mothers and girl-friends that, to her credit, feel completely different.
In "Sleepwalking," she's at it again, and a lot of me actually wishes she'd stop. Not because she's bad, although in this film she comes close, but because her compulsion to spelunk through one dark life after another isn't always redeemed by good moviemaking. "Sleepwalking" is the least of her impoverished-victim pictures. It starts as "mama was a rolling stone" story and winds up a runny melodrama.
Theron's semi-blowsy, self-pitying character, Joleen, wears high-heeled snakeskin boots, tight jeans, and great big earrings. She's the kind of woman who needs to hear "I love you" from the man she just picked up at a bar and who carries her 12-year-old, Tara (AnnaSophia Robb), from the bed they share out to the living room so she can make drunken love to that man. Never mind that the shabby railroad-side apartment and the affronted bed belong to her meek brother, James (Nick Stahl), who's asleep on a couch.
Maybe she's to be confused with the home-wrecker in Dolly Parton's "Jolene." I preferred what Amy Ryan was up to with a better, similarly messy part in "Gone Baby Gone." A few scenes later, Joleen tells James to be a man then promptly abandons him, Tara, and the film. He loses his construction job (Woody Harrelson has too few scenes as a co-worker), his apartment, and Tara (to child services). So he turns himself and his niece into fugitives. They get in the car and drive east while the movie heads further south.
What follows is a Heartland gothic that returns James to the Nebraska horse ranch of the father who abused him and Joleen. Heartless old dad is played by Dennis Hopper wearing Dennis Weaver's mustache. To reach something approaching a rousing climax, James and Tara stick around long enough for dad to turn into his former monstrous self.
A movie like this needs full-bodied filmmaking and full-bodied characters. The director, William Maher, tries conjuring up a grim industrial America. (The movie was filmed in Canada, and Maher's camera is most comfortable perched among telephone wires.) The screenwriter, Zac Stanford, is pulling all the strings right down to the cheap, lazy ending. The characters in "Sleepwalking" behave like people in movies, not people in life.
The title, as it turns out, is accurate, although Robb gives her part surprising steeliness. In the movie's most interesting scene, Tara suggestively lies poolside at a motel while two little boys check her out. She lights a cigarette and roller-skates toward the diving board in essence, becoming the mother she's so desperate to see again. But the movie seems terrified of true psychological complexity or perversity. It's less a family tragedy than a lousy country dirge.


If you had programmed a computer to come up with a movie that is nothing but a string of the deadliest indie-film situations and moods (working-class small-town broken marriage; girl in search of Truth About Her Family; rambling road trip; glacial pauses between mournful thoughts), you'd have Sleepwalking , a soporific dud, which should have been tossed out of Sundance. When 12-year-old Tara's mother (Charlize Theron) disappears, the girl (AnnaSophia Robb) heads off with her uncle (Nick Stahl) for an odyssey of dullness. They're sleepwalking, all right, and you will be too.

 Filmed mostly in winter, in browns, grays and soiled whites, “Sleepwalking” sustains a mood of unrelenting bleakness, wearing its aesthetic of desolation like a badge of integrity. Integrity and quality, unfortunately, are not synonymous. “Sleepwalking” may linger in downscale territory where few movies — even indies — dare to tread, but it has far too many flaws to make it a likely candidate for awards consideration. And isn’t that kind of recognition the only commercial hope for gloomy kitchen-sink dramas?  Set in northern California and Utah but filmed in Saskatchewan, the movie, directed by William Maher from a screenplay by Zac Stanford (“The Chumscrubber”), evokes a depressed environment of ugly, cramped apartments and flimsy shacks, junk furniture, muddy backyards and chain-link fences. As its characters eke out a marginal existence, they are defined by this oppressive milieu. When they break the rules, the police, social service agencies and debt collectors are poised to crush whatever hopes they have left. As the song says, “Them that’s got shall get/Them that’s not shall lose.”  How is an 11-year-old girl brought up in such conditions to find a better life? That’s a question Tara Reedy (AnnaSophia Robb) hardly dares ask. As the film begins she and her reckless, slatternly mother, Joleen (Charlize Theron), have been evicted from the house where they were staying with Joleen’s latest boyfriend, who was busted for growing marijuana. Tara has no choice but to trail along glumly as Joleen is reduced to begging her meek, ne’er-do-well younger brother, James (Nick Stahl), to take them in.  No sooner have they moved into James’s dingy apartment than Joleen runs off with a truck driver, leaving Tara with her uncle, who works on a road-building crew. After missing one too many days on the job, he is fired. He and Tara end up crashing in the basement of his married best friend, Randall (Woody Harrelson). It isn’t long before Tara lands in a foster home.  In a last-ditch effort to put down roots, James snatches Tara from foster care, packs them into a car and drives to the childhood home he and Joleen fled many years earlier. The scenes of James and Tara, who agree to pose as father and daughter, developing a familial bond while on the road give the movie its only glimmer of sweetness. Once they arrive at the Reedy homestead — a run-down cattle and horse farm that is an American gothic house of horrors — they are immediately put to work as unpaid slave labor by the monstrous paterfamilias (Dennis Hopper).  “Sleepwalking” is the kind of movie in which every character tic and nuance of dialogue has to be perfectly calibrated for it to ring true. In the early scenes, a careful attention to detail leads you to hope it might succeed. But as Mr. Maher, in his feature directing debut, brings in surreal touches and puts on literary airs, the film’s grip loosens, and its vernacular turns increasingly wooden.  In the most glaring moment, James, describing his life, uses the movie’s title in a baldly inserted statement. A clever fantasy sequence in which Tara is observed by two young boys while lounging poolside at a motel, wearing pink sunglasses and roller skates, seems to belong to another movie. Before it reaches a tentative, unsatisfying ending, “Sleepwalking” metamorphoses from meticulous social realism to horror thriller.  If the performances are strong, the casting isn’t quite right. Mr. Stahl’s James is a little too sensitive and well spoken for the role of a born loser. Ms. Theron’s Joleen should have been closer to Amy Ryan’s crude, careless mother in “Gone Baby Gone.” Ms. Robb’s Tara is the best thing in the movie. This tense, wary Lolita — albeit one with no inclination to play teasing games — understands her lowly station in life. As much as she cares about her mother, she is determined not to follow in her footsteps. Her only choice is to grit her teeth and bide her time.  “Sleepwalking” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, strong language and violence.

A dysfunctional family gets a therapeutic reshuffling via abandonment, unemployment, abuse and murder in �Sleepwalking,� which traces the fallout when a barely functional uncle assumes responsibility for his 11-year-old niece after her mother skips town. Bleakly striking visuals and a name cast (Nick Stahl, Dennis Hopper, Woody Harrelson and producer Charlize Theron) ratchet up the emotional intensity, but the overly simplistic script by Zac Stanford (�The Chumscrubber�) hits nothing but high notes, making the whole dramatically less than the sum of its parts. Broody meller, skedded for March 14 limited release, may ultimately depend on producer Theron�s star power.
Forced out of her boyfriend�s house when he�s busted for growing marijuana, Joleen (Theron) and her daughter Tara (AnnaSophia Robb) move into the dreary digs of Joleen�s younger brother James (Stahl), ironically nicknamed Speedy for his less-than-quicksilver grasp of events. But emotionally distraught Joleen soon hooks up with a truck driver, leaving an ill-prepared James to �temporarily� care for her wise-beyond-her-years daughter.
Pic geographically divides into three parts. The first, set in a Northern California town, limns James� ineffectual stabs at child-rearing, ending with him losing his apartment and road construction job, relocating to the basement of a hard-drinking pal (Harrelson) and abandoning Tara to the tender mercies of social services. 
But James soon rescues Tara, and the two, happily pretending to be father and daughter, romp and smile through musical montages in pic�s road-movie phase. As they head toward the family farm, the only refuge James knows, bits and pieces of his and Joleen�s traumatic past begin to surface.
Once at the Utah farm, presided over by James� dour, abusive nightmare of a father (Hopper), pic turns pure American Gothic, replete with wild-eyed horses and lumbering cows. Here, in pic�s cathartic finale, James must reverse his longtime acceptance of a half-life spent �sleepwalking.�
Gifted thesps mostly manage to naturalize the script�s heavy-handed psychology and strained dialogue. Theron proves particularly impressive in her impulsive grab at sexual gratification, while Robb�s subtly portrayed affection for her balances the maternal scales.
First-time helmer and former f/x wrangler William Maher deploys consistently inventive compositions to reflect the characters� mindsets, but cannot inject the film with any downtime or ambient reality to offset its increasingly wearisome angst. Every secondary character relates directly to the leads in one-note fashion, be it fervently macho, motherly or sadistic; even the road trip yields no casually colorful local characters.
A couple of standout, hyperreal scenes allow the film to travel more imaginative paths. One is a brief, unexplained roadside interlude in which a succession of identical trucks emerge from the twilight mist, while Tara strains toward them as if searching their cabs for her mother. 
Another scene -- in which Tara is spied on by two boys while she�s stretched out, fully clothed, by a motel pool -- recalls the voyeuristic reverie in �American Beauty,� the distinction between reality and fantasy kept deliberately hazy.
Although chilly Saskatchewan locations sub for American locales, veteran lenser Juan Ruiz Anchia opts to convey the icy barrenness of the soul over geographical verisimilitude, as does Paki Smith�s impressively desolate set design. 



Joleen Reedy  (Charlize Theron ) is the kind of broad who has second thoughts right before nailing her date on the kitchen table while her brother James (Nick Stahl ) pretend-sleeps on the couch—instead, she removes her daughter Tara (AnnaSophia Robb ) from the only bedroom and continues the festivities there. Sleepwalking , the directorial debut of William Maher , is the kind of film that expects you to respond to this scenario with a sort of grim, Pavlovian determination, knuckling down for 90 minutes more of the same in the hope of some reward. Nearly relentless in its bleakness, Sleepwalking  follows Tara and James as they strike out of their dead-end town when deadbeat Joleen buggers off. They wind up at their American Gothic homestead, subject to the relentless assholery of the family patriarch (Dennis Hopper ), which is what drove James and Joleen away (and possibly crazy) in the first place. Stahl seems as adrift as we are within James's utter blankness, and Robb—a naturally mesmerizing presence—hints at a better movie when feeling her oats in sunglasses and roller skates while two star-struck young boys look on. Theron and Woody Harrelson  (as James's party pal Randall) provide vitality against the film's heavy load, but they aren't around long enough to keep it from collapsing under its own portentous weight.
