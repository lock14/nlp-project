I hate to sound like a disappointed parent, but I expected more from Luke Wilson. After he shined as a new kind of confused and despondent hero in Bottle Rocket
, after he saved The Royal Tenenbaums
 from drowning in cleverness, after he anchored Old School
 with a little real-life pathos, I thought for sure the youngest Wilson brother was bound for great and original things. Well, The Wendell Baker Story
 (which made its world premiere at South by Southwest Film 05) will teach me to get my hopes up. Wilson wrote the movie and co-directed it with his oldest brother, Andrew, and its first half – in which we meet Wendell, a good-natured, fast-talking, seersucker-suit-wearing deadbeat who's arrested for selling fake driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants out of an old Airstream trailer ("The Ellis Island of the Southwest") � is harmless enough. Sure, it owes a heavy debt to the Coen brothers' Raising Arizona
 � with its cockeyed camera angles, elaborate comic set-pieces, and its story about a lovable loser who finds himself on the wrong side of the law � but at least there's life and energy in those first 40 minutes. Which is more than you can say for the second. After Wendell is released from prison, his story and his personality take a dramatic turn for the soporific. Suddenly, this two-bit con is playing the hero, fighting against the sinister head nurse of a retirement hotel (played by the middle Wilson brother, Owen, who once again shows off his acting chop), and gradually stripping himself of any discernible personality traits, save dull decency. Rallying a band of mistreated elderly residents, Wendell sets out to make things right at the hotel and win back the love of his estranged girlfriend, Doreen (Mendes), who, apparently, was sick of dating a man who wears aviator sunglasses. And just like that, Wendell Baker � charming snake-oil salesman, ice purveyor to the Eskimos � is dead, replaced by Wendell Baker � self-help philosopher and rank sentimentalist. Of all the types of heroes in Hollywood history, there is none so depressing as the free thinker whose sins are washed away in a river of conventionality. Poor Wendell, we hardly knew you. (See p.62 of this week's Screens section for an interview with Luke and Andrew Wilson.)


         If, upon exiting "The Wendell Baker Story," you find yourself wondering whether we're in the midst of some kind of Baldwinization of the Wilson brothers, you may as well know this now: Three is all there is. If they seem to be proliferating, that's because their latest collaboration, "The Wendell Baker Story," involves all of them. Luke and Owen star, and Andrew co-directs with Luke, who also wrote. It creates the appearance of a crowd, this Luke wearing three times as many hats as he has heads.
 
 The hipster-folksy story of an amiable con man named Wendell (Luke) who lands in jail after his lucrative business selling Texas ID cards to illegal immigrants is busted, "The Wendell Baker Story" trots casually down the same path beaten by the heroes of "Rushmore," "Napoleon Dynamite," "Nacho Libre" and every other deluded dreamer we've come to know and love in recent years.
 


         






   A feckless hero in the last flower of late adolescence — that being, of course, the adolescence that directly abuts middle-age — Wendell charms his way through life. He adapts easily to prison, brokering peace agreements between black inmates and skinheads and turning the prison into a decent approximation of a social club. But the tension between his illegal actions and his more attractive innate attributes fails to gel into anything resembling tension — perhaps because we've seen it before, more likely because he's designed that way, not to get worked up over anything.
 
 Why his girlfriend, Doreen (Eva Mendes), a Sophia Loren-esque bombshell who has waited her whole life to hear that Wendell loves her, puts up with him as long as she does is unclear — or rather, it's clear but unconvincing. Like Wendell, she's an inner child exteriorized, an innocent with a Teflon soul. Doreen finally gives up and finds herself a responsible grocery store manager (Will Ferrell). Irma (Angela Alvarado), the stern wife of Wendell's best friend, Reyes (Jacob Vargas), forbids her husband to see him after he's released and Wendell is forced to face the fact that it's time to grow up.
 
 What does he do? While in prison, he picks up a copy of Conrad Hilton's book about his hotel empire and brushes up on the business.
 
 If this sounds like the most circuitous path to adulthood ever taken, it pretty much is. After his release, Wendell is sent to work at a retirement hotel run by corrupt nurse Neil King (Owen) and his sidekick McTeague (Eddie Griffin), who are running a scam similar to the one Ione Skye's father ran in "Say Anything," only meaner and more complicated. Wendell, who just wants to get back on track, teams up with a trio of formidable codgers (Seymour Cassel, Harry Dean Stanton and Kris Kristofferson) to bring down King. Three plots into the story, it's hard to keep invested in Wendell's problems. It's hard to keep track of them too.
 
 Still, a cast this charismatic is bound to make something of the situation. In short bursts, the movie is alternately sunny and charming, dark and weird, confounding and dull until it finally dives off the deep end into a wish-fulfillment conclusion that leaves you wondering if Brett Ratner flew in at the last minute to doctor the finale.
 
 Stranger things, I guess, have happened. But it's enough to make you long for the good old days when Wendell was in prison. As much as it looks like an enjoyable project to work on and a blast for all involved, the feeling you get watching "The Wendell Baker Story" is that you probably had to be there.

Has ironic detachment become the new sincerity? It would be easy to call The Wendell Baker Story  the scrappy, quirky tale of an outlaw-dude con man, only that description leaves out its key selling point: The entire movie comes at you in air quotes. Luke Wilson, who wrote and codirected and also plays the breezy scoundrel hero, bounces from one predicament to the next (selling fake IDs to Mexican immigrants; working at a ''retirement hotel''), never showing the tiniest variation in mood or inflection, never altering his life-is-a-late-night-comedy-sketch obliviousness. He's Attitude Man, cruising along on his smugly self-amused ''charm.'' In prison, when Wendell stares at his best girl (Eva Mendes) through the Plexiglas and says, ''I'd take a month in solitary for just one kiss,'' the romanticism is so mocking it's absurd, so absurd it's hi -larious (as opposed to, you know, funny), and therefore the film's version of a heartfelt gesture. Or something.
The Wendell Baker Story  has been kicking around since 2005 at festivals, where it has won a bit of a following, making me one of the few who don't ''get'' it. I enjoyed Owen Wilson's performance as a venal rest-home official  his line readings have bite, as opposed to Luke's mild solipsistic droop  and Seymour Cassel and Harry Dean Stanton both perform with grizzled gumption. But The Wendell Baker Story  just feels like an attempt to rebottle the postmodern fizz of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket . I wish instead they'd put a stopper in it.

 Venture capitalist: that’s the misleading job description preferred by the title character of the slight and silly “Wendell Baker Story.” Wendell (Luke Wilson), a cheerful Texan slacker, runs a profitable operation on the Tex-Mex border selling fake driver’s licenses to illegal  migrant workers.  Wendell, who works with a partner, Reyes (Jacob Vargas), out of an Airstream trailer he calls the Ellis Island of the Southwest, means no harm. A Panglossian eternal teenager at heart, he is madly in love with his girlfriend, Doreen (Eva Mendes). She, however, is running out of patience with his protracted adolescence.  This shambling, good-natured comedy is a Wilson family affair. Written by Luke Wilson, who directed with his older brother Andrew, it also stars a third brother, Owen, as Wendell’s nemesis. The appeal of “The Wendell Baker Story” depends on how charming you find the Wilson brothers, with their chipmunk grins and hip smart-aleck attitude. For my taste, a little goes a long way. But if you like Lyle Lovett songs, Thomas McGuane novels and sardonic country yarns sung by grizzled Texan “outlaws,” you’ll have no trouble slipping into its easygoing groove, fortified by its country-rock soundtrack. Smirks are to be had, but no belly laughs.  Wendell knows how to make the best of a dicey situation. Caught by the Border Patrol and sent to prison, he negotiates peace between the Crips and the Aryan Brotherhood while studying hotel management, an ideal occupation for someone with his obvious people skills.  Love, though, is another matter. Doreen has had enough. She deserts him, only to reappear much later, when Wendell spots her photo at a supermarket whose manager (an uncredited, very funny Will Ferrell) is her possessive new boyfriend. The Shady Grove retirement hotel, where Wendell begins his postprison career, isn’t exactly the Austin Hilton or even a Holiday Inn. It is a decrepit palace whose head nurse, Neil King (Owen Wilson), runs a Medicare fraud scam in which he and his partner, McTeague (Eddie Griffin), bilk selected residents of their benefits by giving them what they call “the Greyhound treatment.”  It isn’t clear how it works, except that those chosen are dispatched to his mother’s farm in the middle of nowhere where they do heaven knows what. There are intimations that it is a slave labor camp from which there is no exit. Neil’s fearsome mother, Wanda (Jo Harvey Allen), a glaring, trigger-happy termagant, patrols the place with a rifle. To delve deeper into the scheme would break the prevailing tongue-in-cheekiness.  ”The Wendell Baker Story” is also a salute to grumpy old men, but with a transgressive twist. In Texas at least, grumpy old men appears to mean dirty old men who trumpet their undiminished virility in gravelly Willie Nelson voices, flicks of the tongue and beady-eyed babe-ogling. At Shady Grove, Wendell befriends two such roués, Skip Summers (Harry Dean Stanton) and Boyd Fullbright (Seymour Cassel), lifelong best friends champing at the bit for some action. The scenes of these sly silver foxes drooling over two 16-year-old girls behind the counter of a convenience store celebrate rakish seniority with unabashed glee.  When gaunt, hawk-eyed Skip boasts about his prowess, the girls’ ears perk up.  Under Wendell’s tutelage, Summer and Boyd team up with Nasher (Kris Kristofferson), a mysterious Shady Grove resident who suggests a benign Howard Hughes, to liberate the farm and engineer Neil’s downfall. As the movie winds down, it softens into an earthbound, feel-good answer to “Cocoon.”    “The Wendell Baker Story” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations and off-color humor. 

At once insouciantly laid back and beguilingly loony, "The Wendell Baker Story" plays like a playful throwback to those shambling shaggy-dog comedies and dramedies of the 1970s - think "Rancho Deluxe," "Kid Blue" or "92 in the Shade" - treasured as cult faves by many movie buffs with a major jones for cinema of the Polyester Era. There's definite sleeper potential for Luke Wilson's triple-threat effort as scripter, co-director and star if savvy distrib can figure a way to market hard-to-categorize pic. Ancillary biz should be pleasing for all parties involved.
Pic is very much a family affair, with Luke sharing directorial duties with brother Andrew Wilson, and sharing screen time with brother Owen Wilson (perfectly cast against type as a comically venal baddie). Not surprisingly, Luke saves much of the funniest funny business in his casually constructed scenario for himself. But he's also generous about sharing the wealth with vet character actors Harry Dean Stanton, Seymour Cassel and Kris Kristofferson, and younger co-stars Eva Mendes, Eddie Griffin and Jacob Vargas.
Filmed in and around Austin, "The Wendell Baker Story" recounts the misadventures of title character, an eternally optimistic con artist who tries to fulfill big-time dreams with small-time schemes. Wendell (Luke Wilson) comes off as relentlessly ingratiating in his snappy sales patter while selling counterfeit driver's licenses to undocumented migrant workers along the Tex-Mex border. (He proudly claims Jimmy Smits and Salma Hayek among past customers for his fake I.D.'s) But even Wendell can't smooth-talk his way out of a prison sentence when he's busted during an undercover sting.
Wendell makes the best of his time behind bars, breezing through his sentence with an attitude that suggests frat-house exuberance more than hard-time endurance. (Biggest laugh: He casually establishes a live-and-let-live truce between black inmates and Aryan Brotherhood types.) In a characteristically ambitious move, he frequents the prison library to teach himself the rudiments of hotel management.
Once he returns to the outside world, however, even the ever-chipper Wendell finds reasons to frown. Reyes (Vargas), his former partner-in-crime, has gone straight (reluctantly) at the insistence of his wife. And Doreen (Mendes), Wendell's former girlfriend, has opted to pursue a more stable relationship with grocery owner Dave Bix (a hilariously hot-tempered cameo by unbilled Will Ferrell).
Fortuitously, Wendell gets a shot at redemption when he lands a post-prison position at Shady Grove, a seedy retirement hotel where head nurse Neil King (Owen Wilson) rules as a casually cruel yet hazily focused tyrant. Assuming no one would believe the testimony of an easily framed ex-con grifter, Neil tries to enlist Wendell in a scam involving Medicare payments and forced labor. But Wendell decides to cast his lot instead with three of the hotel's "guests" - shamelessly frisky Boyd (Cassel) and Skip (Stanton) and mysteriously reclusive Nasher (Kristofferson), with all three thesps doing vivid, idiosyncratic work.
Proceeding at the amiable pace of a cheery stoner on a Sunday afternoon stroll, "The Wendell Baker Story" is a loose-knit, character-driven comedy that percolates with good-vibe amusement, often earning industrial-strength guffaws with sneaky one-liners and tossed-off non-sequiturs.
The co-directing Wilson siblings smartly refrain from pushing anything too hard or too often, making the unpredictable eruptions of straight-faced absurdity all the more effective.
Luke Wilson is extremely engaging in lead role, even when (or maybe that should be especially 
when) Wendell evidences self-confidence that appears entirely unjustified. Owen Wilson nonchalantly steals several scenes with a little help from Eddie Griffin as Neil's none-too-bright partner in crime. Mendes and Vargas round out the cast with appealing supporting turns.
Eclectic mix of pop and country tunes on soundtrack - ranging from Rick Nelson's "Garden Party" to Stanton's rendition of Chuck Berry's "Promised Land" - enhances overall mood of free-form larkiness. Other tech credits are pro.

The most obvious examples of American neo-New Wave movies, namely, those directed or influenced by Quentin Tarantino , are genre-reconstruction jobs, laden with references to outré classics of the sort that can no longer be made. Another sort of neo-New Wave production is the shaggy-dog story that lazily chases its own tail (Jim Jarmusch 's Stranger Than Paradise  being the mode's masterpiece). Such movies are generally underwritten and often overacted, a showcase for oddball personalities.
Hal Hartley 's Fay Grim  and Luke Wilson 's The Wendell Baker Story  (co-directed with brother Andrew) make a prime pair of shaggy dogs. Each of these character-driven comedies is named after its lovably "innocent" protagonist and both are nostalgic for the Hollywood  New Wave of the '70s, susceptible to unearned drollery, and prone to hit-or-miss wackiness. Where Fay Grim 's arch one-liners seem intended to raise a quizzical eyebrow, Wendell Baker   goes for the goofy, slack-jawed guffaw. What's truly disarming, however, is that as fond as they are of their own quirks, and as inured as they seem to conventional narrative rhythms, neither of these movies could even have fallen off the Hollywood assembly line.
Hard to remember, but back in the early 1990s, Hartley was regarded as the  hot, young avant Amerindie, and following critically acclaimed festival hits like Trust  (1990) and Simple Men  (1992), 1997's Henry Fool  , a seriously frivolous allegory on art, fame, fate, and the power of the Internet, was hailed as his breakthrough. "The affectless precision of Hal Hartley's previous work is absolutely no preparation for the brilliance and deep resonance of his Henry Fool . Here is a great American film," Janet Maslin  proclaimed in The New York Times  , complete with comparison to Nashville .
Such effusive over-praise must have cast a negative spell. Hartley's career promptly stumbled, and as Henry Fool 's belated sequel, Fay Grim  seems nearly an act of desperation. Three of the principals returnthe Queens  sanitation man turned poet Simon Grim  (professionally affectless James Urbaniak ), his sister Fay (Parker Posey ), and, briefly, the saturnine mystery tramp who changed their life, Henry Fool (Thomas Jay Ryan ). A decade has passed, and Fay fears that her 14-year-old son will grow up to be like his vanished and extravagantly disreputable father, Henryor is that Hartley's hope for the movie?
Actually, Fay Grim  is the Parker Posey show. Her chiseled nose and down-turned mouth a priori edgy, Posey cuts a naturally cartoonish figure and, as demonstrated most recently by her broad turn as Lex Luthor 's moll in Superman Returns  (something of a shaggy-dog blockbuster), she can play physical comedy. As an actress, her allegiance belongs less to her character than her look, but she's so distinctive a presence that she has the effect here of naturalizing the normally ungainly Jeff Goldblum , who appears, with unexpected gravitas, as a duplicitous spook.
The CIA  comes to Queens. Not lacking for ambition, Fay Grim  adds a topical, national-security subtext to Henry Fool 's more romantic concerns for the power of art and the mystery of artistic creation: The MacGuffin is a series of confessional notebooks that Henry may have written in a code that, although seemingly inspired by the French primitive surrealist Raymond Roussel , amounts to a secret, highly damning history of the Reagan Era. The stakes have been raised: Where literature rocked individual worlds in Henry Fool , here it bids to rock the World.
Sometimes, in cryptography, the truth hides in plain sight: Fay Grim's two-word title perfectly evokes the two poles of the filmmaker's whimsical yet leaden sensibility. The initial mode is fey. Transposed from Woodside  to Paris in search of the notebooks, Posey looks smashing in a fitted town-coat ensemble so swanky that Hartley feels obliged to write an explanation for how she got it. (An ingenue no more, Posey channels her inner fashion model.) Intrigue swirls around her slit skirts, some of it in the form of Elina Löwensohnanother underappreciated, eccentric performer, here dressed in vintage Madonna  cast-offs. For perhaps 40 minutes, Fay Grim  actually sort of works as a comic thriller, albeit more amusing than funny. All manner of agents are in pursuit of Henry's notebooks. "The Russians extorted them from the North Koreans," one tells Fay. Hartley underscores and undercuts this conspiratorial nonsense with a bit of background tooting. (The film's music, as usual, is his own.) Then things change.
With all manner of backstories and flashbacks jamming the road, the Posey-mobile starts to swerve and sputter and finally blows a tire (in Istanbul  no less). For all the tonal shifts, Hartley's stylea matter of tense line readings, emphatically tilted compositions, and select running gagsremains grimly determined. But it's precisely when Fay Grim  strains for the big narrative revelation that it seems least con- sequential. Would that Hartley let shaggy dogs lie.
