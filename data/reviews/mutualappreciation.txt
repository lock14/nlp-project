As modest as a mash note scrawled by a very shy English major onto a bar napkin, Funny Ha Ha , the first movie written and directed by Andrew Bujalski, was hailed as the fresh voice of a generation. If you see his follow-up, the charming if a wee-bit-too-wee Mutual Appreciation , you'll know why. Bujalski's characters still talk in spilled ironic fragments, rationalizing their tiniest impulses (for a kiss, a joke, a beer), turning every thought, every moment, into a coyly halting ''creative'' observation. This time, though, Bujalski works in streaky black and white, looking back all the more to Cassavetes and the Left Bank conversational epic The Mother and the Whore . The central figure, Alan (Justin Rice), with his bed head and his grin of shy vanity, is an aspiring indie rocker, which means that he has a ''band'' that consists of whomever he happens to be jamming with that week, at gigs attended mostly by his friends. In Brooklyn, Alan is staying with an old buddy, Lawrence (played by Bujalski), who's like Gary Dell'Abate as a young computer geek, and he also has a quasi-flirtation going with Lawrence's girlfiend, Ellie (Rachel Clift), who treats her romantic desires as an inconvenience, a disruption of the nervous, stuttery we're-all-boho-comrades-here style she wears like armor. If this is the sound of a new generation, then it may be the first generation cautious enough to embrace friendship as mightier than love.

 The wonderful independent film “Mutual Appreciation” looks like something that just came out of a time capsule, but there’s nothing dusty about it. Shot on expressively grainy black-and-white celluloid, the film has the kind of artfully artless, low-fi vibe that brings to mind the French New Wave of the late 1950’s and the East Village film scene of the late 1970’s. It’s the sort of unassuming discovery that could get lost in a crowd or suffer from too much big love, and while it won’t save or change your life, it may make your heart swell. Its aim is modest and true.  The film was written and directed by the 29-year-old Andrew Bujalski, who, in keeping with the D.I.Y. ethos of classic independence, plays one of the film’s leads, a teaching assistant named Lawrence. He enters soon after the film opens, as another young man, Alan (Justin Rice), talks with a young woman, Ellie (Rachel Clift), on a bed plopped on the floor of a sparsely furnished apartment. The two are clothed, but from the easiness of their conversation and the way her arms move, almost as if they wanted to reach out across the bed, it feels as if maybe they wish they weren’t. The bed belongs to Lawrence, who, on entering this cozy setup, promptly wedges his body between his girlfriend and best friend.  Lawrence loves Ellie, and she says she loves him, but one year into the relationship she seems uneasy. Maybe it’s Lawrence or maybe it’s Alan: your boyfriend’s rock-musician best friend can do that to a girl, though Mr. Bujalski would never propose something so psychologically crude. His characters are self-conscious if not especially self-aware, and he isn’t about to let on that he’s more on the ball than they are. And, in a sense, they’re both still figuring it out. Mr. Bujalski earned some serious critical attention with his even more unassuming first feature, “Funny Ha Ha,” which was more knowing than its scruffy surfaces might suggest. The more openly ambitious “Mutual Appreciation” shows that the first film wasn’t a fluke and that Mr. Bujalski is beginning to appreciate visual beauty.  ‘“Mutual Appreciation” is what might be called character-driven, because not much happens. But Alan, Ellie and Lawrence don’t actually drive the film; they inhabit it, like people who took up residence long ago. So, what’s it about? Everything, nothing. Mostly, though, it’s about a group of young people trying to figure out where they fit into the world. And so they talk and talk and talk some more, circling and hedging and stammering “you know, umm.” Ellie teases Lawrence, who’s so deep in the relationship he can’t see her struggle. Hiding behind a killer smile, Alan repeats questions like a defense witness, as when Sara (Seung-Min Lee) asks if he has a girlfriend. “Do I have a girlfriend?” he echoes, as if wondering the same.  That scene with Alan and Sara is just about perfect. Alan, the only remaining member of a band called the Bumblebees, meets Sara at a radio station where she’s a D.J. They end up at her apartment, where he scrutinizes her books as if looking for clues. She offers him a beer and sits on her bed, apologizing that there are no chairs. (Never mind the sofa in the other room.) After she asks about a girlfriend and he repeats the question, Mr. Bujalski cuts from the two sitting together to Sara climbing onto Alan’s suddenly prone body. The cut underscores the scene’s painful comedy (it’s funny ha ha), but it also deepens the feeling because it reminds us of how bodies can speak more plaintively than words.  In writing about “Funny Ha Ha,” critics sometimes invoked John Cassavetes, the godhead of American independent cinema. Cassavetes too often serves as shorthand for anything that looks and sounds somewhat rough around the edges, authentic and seemingly unscripted (though what a burden that name can be, especially for young filmmakers). But what connects “Funny Ha Ha” and “Mutual Appreciation” to Cassavetes, or at least his legacy of willful independence, isn’t the handheld camera work or the persistent intimacy, which could have easily been learned from cinéma vérité. If Mr. Bujalski has learned anything from Cassavetes, it’s that films should be about life, not death, fashion or virtuosity, and that there are few more meaningful subjects for art and for personal expression than other people.  If “Mutual Appreciation” doesn’t look like any film out on screens today, it does boldly look back at Jean Eustache’s landmark of modern French cinema, “The Mother and the Whore.” Released in 1973, Eustache’s long generational bleat pivots on a handful of chatty young Parisians who are blotto with booze, sex and narcissism. The men and women in “Mutual Appreciation” often come across as being as inwardly directed as those in the Eustache; the crucial difference is that the shadow of 1968 that hangs over the French characters invests their self-absorption with an intimation of tragedy. Mr. Bujalski’s characters, by contrast, don’t even have generational failure on their side, an absence of history, of myth, alluded to by Alan’s drunken confession that all he wants out of life is “a good story.”  In a different film, that good story might mean a record deal and a surfeit of cool. But, like Ryan Fleck’s “Half Nelson” and Kelly Reichardt’s forthcoming “Old Joy,” two other hopeful signs of cinematic life from young American directors, “Mutual Appreciation” is a film that makes a strong, sincere case that we only get that good story with other people. It’s not for nothing that Alan is a man in search of a band. The need for mutual appreciation, as it were, is beautifully telegraphed by Mr. Bujalski in that scene when Sara abruptly tackles Alan. She tells him he seems nervous, not knowing that one of his hands is hovering above her back, trembling like a flag of surrender. “I just have, uh,” he stammers, “a congenital tremor.

If John Cassavetes had directed a script by Eric Rohmer, the result might have looked and sounded like "Mutual Appreciation." Indie auteur Andrew Bujalski ("Funny Ha-Ha") has studied his mentors closely -- Mike Leigh and Jim Jarmusch are among his other obvious influences -- and put whatever lessons he learned to good use in this unaffectedly naturalistic and appealingly quirky low-key comedy about twentysomethings in the process of inventing themselves. Fest-friendly pic should earn appreciative reviews and respectable B.O. in limited theatrical play.
Justin Rice hits all the right notes of ego, anxiety and affability as Alan, alt-pop singer-songwriter who travels to New York after a break-up with his bandmates. Disbanded group achieved just enough recognition with a promising CD for Alan to land a Manhattan club date. Just as important, his semi-celebrity status gets him an interview spot on radio show hosted by Sara (Seung-Min Lee), who later lures an ambivalent Alan into bed.
Despite the post-interview one-on-one, Alan insists he's too focused on his music to waste time on distractions. Trouble is, he can't help feeling some stirrings of attraction to Ellie (Rachel Clift), longtime live-in girlfriend of Alan's buddy Lawrence (writer-director Bujalski). The attraction is mutual, but both parties are reluctant to take next step.
Much like Rohmer, Bujalski offers sympathetic scrutiny of characters who are so loquacious and self-analytical they seem driven to talk themselves out of happiness. But whereas Rohmer's characters generally are erudite and eloquent, Bujalski's vaguely discontented twentysomethings hem and haw, stumble and mumble. Many scenes have a semi-improvisational feel, but static stretches are rare. Perfect-pitch performances go a long way toward giving seemingly shapeless scenes some semblance of narrative momentum.
Pic has the tone of a shaggy-dog comedy, but that's not to say it lacks edge. Cassavetes' influence is most apparent whenever Bujalski hints at darker undercurrents and potential pitfalls.
There's an ineffable air of underlying tension, if not percolating menace, during an extended post-concert get-together in the apartment of a too-friendly record exec (Bill Morrison). Similar suspense tempers the surface frivolity while attractive women cajole Alan into wearing make-up during a latenight party. Neither scene pays off in predictably melodramatic fashion, but that does little to dispel the uneasiness Bujalski subtly generates.
Grainy look of B&W cinematography and slightly scruffy production design add to the impression of real life captured by a clear-eyed, fair-minded and heartily bemused observer.

Andrew Bujalski  has produced only a pair of micro-budget 16mm features since 2002but it's taken this narrow-casting, thirtyish Harvard  grad only those two features to stake out a particular territory as well as a fan base.
Bujalski's first production, set in a post-graduate milieu, drew heavily on his college confreres, using nonprofessionals to portray a small galaxy of awkwardly diffident young peoplethe most obnoxious loser played by the filmmaker himself. The film, which won Bujalski an Independent Spirit award, was titled Funny Ha Ha precisely because it wasn't. Or, rather, wasn't exactly. (Funny, that is.)
Gently persistent in its ironies, Funny Ha Ha managed to be both charmingly lackadaisical and annoyingly smug; Mutual Appreciation , which Bujalski shot in grainy black-and-white in hipster Brooklyn  (and is self-distributing), is even more so. The movie opens with a couple sprawled out on a mattress . . . talking. Ellie (Rachel Clift ), a thin girl with retro-bobbed hair, is mumbling something about being a tired vegetarian; Alan (Justin Rice ) is mainly grinning a big-faced smirk.
Bujalski's characters don't suggest types so much as behaviorial nebulae whose interactions are soft, tentative collisions (or, perhaps, mutual appreciations). Just as Ellie and Alan's conversation drifts to a halt, her live-in boyfriend Lawrence (Bujalski) returns home from grad school and flounces down between them. No orgies today though. Sex in Bujalski-land is typically represented as an exploratory kiss that leads to little more than universal confusionas Ellie will later explain in a poignant scene wherein the kiss itself never actually happens.
So what does? Variet y 's reviewer nailed the format: Bujalski turns a John Cassavetes  camera on an Eric Rohmer  talkfest, except that the camera is more relaxed and the actors less animated. Alan, it develops, is a rock staror at least one who, newly arrived in New York, aspires to the success enjoyed by the actor who plays him. (Rice is founder of the indie-rock band Bishop Allen; his cohort Christian Rudder appeared in Funny Ha Ha .) Interviewed by a flirtatious left-dial DJ (Seung-Min Lee ), Alan is next seen at her place, explaining that his band drifted apart and he really needs a drummer.
Bujalski's most avant-garde device is simply cutting from scene to scene, letting the temporal ellipses fall where they might: Alan and the DJ are having dinner when she climbs onto his lap and we deduce that it all has something to do with her drum-playing brother. In a parallel development, Lawrence has been askedby a friend of one of his studentsto participate, as part of an all-male cast, in a staged reading of women's oral histories. He doesn't really say yes but he's unable to say no.
Unaccountably intriguing, these activities build to a series of deadpan dramatic set pieces: Alan's triumphantly credible performance at Northsix is rewarded with two excruciating post-gig parties. His attempt to disengage himself from his demi-consort at one gathering is followed by a creepy-ha-ha run-in with a trio of bewigged witches at a Williamsburg  soiree where he's the only other guest.
Youth-film protagonists typically act as if they're living in a movie. Bujalski's appear to be trapped between parentheses. More fascinating than his borderline tiresome characters is Bujalski's knack for constructing narrative and characterization out of a smartly edited array of seemingly improvised performances and an apparently aimless succession of uninflected moments. (Within the story, his characters can try to figure out if they really had a "moment.")
As filmmaking, Mutual Appreciation  is too stringent to be self-indulgent. Disdaining glamour, Bujalski thrives on the modest truth of clumsy mishaps and incoherent riffs. Cambridge  has a long history of experimental documentary-based filmmaking, from cinema vérité pioneer Ricky Leacock  and ethno-romantic Robert Gardner  through Ed Pincus 's diaries and Ross McElwee 's first-person essays to confessional Super-8 comedians like Joe Gibbons  and Anne Robertson . Bujalski extends the tradition. His characters are certain mainly in their uncertainty. His movies feel most authentic when his actors seem most acutely aware of their inauthenticity.
There's a philosophical paradox at the heart of the filmmaker's enterprise. As wistful Ellie tells embarrassed Alan, "Reality would be nice to talk about." Isn't that the truth.
