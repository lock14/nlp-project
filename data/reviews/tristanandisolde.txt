�Before Romeo & Juliet, there was �� Irritating sentence fragment aside, Tristan & Isolde
�s marketing department got it right. The plot elements have mutated over time, as the myth morphed from 12th-century French poetry to Arthurian offshoot and later, fodder for Wagner, but the story of the star-cross�d Irish princess and the Cornwellian knight who got bitten bad by the love bug (or, depending on the source myth, slurped it from Love Potion No. 9) has always been top of the charts in terms of tragic pairings. Baz Luhrman knew what he was doing when he played out Romeo and Juliet�s climactic death pact to the strains of Wagner�s �Liebestod� (some of the most achingly gorgeous music ever put to page). Would that Tristan & Isolde
�s director, Kevin Reynolds, were similarly inspired toward homage to lift, say, a sassy transvestite or acid tab from Luhrman�s joyfully untraditional adaptation. Alas and alack: no hint of humor or crossdressing in this dopey, mopey, all-around bore. The opening minutes drag out the backstory: Ireland at war with its charges (a motley assortment that straggles toward unification); an orphaned youth, Tristan, taken in by his kindly uncle, Lord Marke (Sewell, uncharacteristically cuckolded); and a sad-eyed Irish lass named Isolde, bitter at a father, the brutish Irish king, who treats her like chattel. Fast-forward nine years: Tristan (Franco) washes up on Irish soil half-dead and is quickly revived by Isolde (Myles). She conceals her identity, they make hot love in the sand, he goes back to where he came from, then returns to unwittingly win her hand in marriage for his uncle, the soon-to-be King of England. Screenwriter Dean Georgaris gets a hell of a pass here � the story is canon, and, in terms of emotional wallop, does all the heavy lifting for him � but he still manages to gunk up the works with dialogue that is dull-witted at best and outright howling at its worst (the clunkers �Take me to the river!� and �Why does loving you feel so wrong?� had me humming Al Green and Luther Ingram in seesawing measures). The film picks up in its last quarter, when Georgaris wisely puts aside so many murderous looks and piffling love declarations for some old-fashioned killing and pillaging, but then botches it again by forcing the viewer to ask: When a war is going down, why are the king and his fiercest lieutenants taking a time-out to attend to the lovesick? It isn�t all Georgaris� fault: Reynolds, most damningly remembered as the captain of Waterworld
, recalls none of the spryness of his 1991 blockbuster, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves
 (which hasn�t exactly aged well, but could be confused for quality vintage compared to T&I
�s canned grape); cinematographer Artur Reinhart dinges everything his camera glances upon (the battle scenes are a mess of swinging axe and mud, the Irish coast a total washout); and the titular lovers come off like horndog adolescents � which would explain their fondness for cooing poetry to each other in the buff. Myles, a suitably medieval-looking British actress, is all right, although her performance owes a major debt to her marvelous hair weave. But Franco � best known from the Spider-Man
 franchise, more beloved as Freaks and Geeks
� Daniel Desario � is a disaster: too pretty to pass for an adrenalized warrior, too tearful to make for a convincing lover. But then, had you headlined this dog � the shooting of which, incidentally, wrapped more than two years ago, making for an especially long haul to the multiplex � you might look a little weepy, too.

''Tristan & Isolde" comes with a crisp reminder from its studio's marketing department: ''Before Romeo & Juliet, there was. . . ." True, but why so defensive? It's not as if the movie is a dreary battle epic disguised as a romantic tragedy. And it's not as if it has to appeal to 15-year-old girls expecting a piece of cinematic candy starring Claire Danes and Leonardo DiCaprio. Oh, wait -- it does. ''Tristan & Isolde" has the duty of telling an ancient, less famous feel-bad love story, the one Shakespeare didn't write and that Baz Luhrmann didn't direct.
''Tristan & Isolde" harks back to Celtic myth and Arthurian times, where a disunited England has shaken off the ill effects of Rome's occupation and is at war with the marauding Irish. The land is ruled by a bunch of squabbling factions whose leaders skulk and grouse about signing an accord meant to redirect everybody's attention toward the Irish and their destructive King Donnachadh (David Patrick O'Hara).
At this point you must be wondering what I was wondering for the first 30 minutes of ''Tristan & Isolde": Where's the love? It's out there somewhere. But first we must watch young Tristan lose his father during a battle. In that skirmish the boy's life is saved by Lord Marke (Rufus Sewell), who loses a hand in the process but gains a son. Tristan grows up and, now played by James Franco, has become Marke's fiercest warrior. Left for dead in battle, Tristan is put on a floating casket that drifts to Ireland, where it washes up and is discovered by Isolde (Sophia Myles), who was in the process of fleeing an arranged marriage.
Instead, she hides Tristan in a cave and brings him back to health, first by taking off all her clothes, ordering her dour helpmeet (Bronagh Gallagher) to do the same, and using their body heat to keep him from freezing. Isolde is a fine nurse and lover, but she neglects to tell the young Englishman that she's also King Donnachadh's little girl.
The poor guy doesn't figure it all out until he's back in England, fighting in a tournament. Tristan wins, and the prize is a bride for Lord Marke from the Irish king: Isolde! Marke is thrilled, Tristan is woebegone, and the movie turns mildly interesting as boy and girl carry on their affair. The romance, however, is secondary to the political back stabbing that Dean Georgaris concocts in his script. Sure, one sort of begets the other, and the fate of two nations hinges on the nondisclosure of the stolen kisses and secret trysts. But, boy, could I have not cared less.
''Tristan & Isolde" was directed by Kevin Reynolds, who made the Kevin Costner ''Robin Hood" and, more notoriously, Costner's ''Waterworld." As was the case with those movies, he's clearly more comfortable leading actors into battle than coaxing them to emote. Franco can be exhilarating in movies -- tremulous, unhinged, a little wild. Here his jaw never stops quivering and his eyes stay welled up, advertising a breakdown that never comes. Not that Myles has a presence a man would fall apart over. She's too professional to drive anybody crazy.
Other vibrant versions of this tale, including a lot of 12th-century poetry, suggest it didn't have to be this way. And according to the film's production notes, ''Tristan & Isolde" has long been a dream project for Tony and Ridley Scott, two of the movie's producers. Their films tell the modern history of the popcorn flick, from ''Alien" and ''Top Gun" to ''Gladiator" and ''Domino." So why didn't one of them direct ''Tristan & Isolde"? It needs something distinctly Scott-ish, like a whiff of trash or a scoop of crazy.

         Love stories come and go, but few have the durability of "Tristan and Isolde." Everyone from German Richard Wagner to Briton Richard Burton (who starred in a 1981 version called "Lovespell") have been fascinated by this Dark Ages tale of star-crossed passion and devotion that would not die.
 
  Director Kevin Reynolds is not exactly in Wagner's league, but he's turned out a satisfactory version of this story of manly men and fervent women. This "Tristan" is a pleasantly old-fashioned epic romance, a bit ungainly but finally the equivalent of having one of those wonderful adventure books illustrated by N.C. Wyeth or Howard Pyle come alive on the screen.
 


         






    Reynolds has been attracted to the epic before — often with dire results: witness "Waterworld," "Rapa Nui" and "The Count of Monte Cristo." But in this case, several factors seem to have helped him avoid going too far over the top.
 
  Screenwriter Dean Georgaris (Jonathan Demme's "The Manchurian Candidate") has done a convincing job with the script. This more realistic, pared "Tristan" does away with the pestilent dragon of the original legend as well as the love potion of Wagner's opera. It also adds a political element by presenting the romance against the backdrop of the weak and preyed-upon tribes of Britain — Jutes, Angles, Saxons and Celts, among others — yearning to unite against the region's Dark Ages dominant power, Ireland.
 
  This "Tristan" has also done well in casting lovers who really seem to care about each other. Though he has a tendency to look pouty and sullen, a holdover, perhaps, from an earlier role as James Dean, James Franco is appropriately handsome and dashing as the great warrior Tristan.
 
  Even better is Sophia Myles (soon to be seen in Terry Zwigoff's "Art School Confidential"), graceful and luminous as the Irish princess who is the other half of the love match.
 
  "Tristan and Isolde" introduces its protagonists as survivors of difficult childhoods. Tristan's parents were killed in an Irish attack and he was raised as a son by Britain's powerful Lord Marke (an especially effective Rufus Sewell, Nixonian 5 o'clock shadow and all). Isolde's mother was felled by "ill vapors," leaving her at the mercy of her brutal father, the Irish King Donnchadh (David Patrick O'Hara), an early practitioner of royal realpolitik who is not above promoting a politically expedient match to a huge bruiser for his only child.
 
  The fates, however, have different ideas. Cute-meet circumstances conspire to place a seriously wounded Tristan on a deserted Irish beach, where Isolde finds him and secretly nurses him back to health without telling him of her royal status. Naturally, the pair fall in love — placing healing leaves on someone's wounds tends to do that to people — but, as one of them says, "we both know it cannot be." Still, neither Tristan nor Isolde can foresee the way a complex web of events will create the crisis of ardor versus duty that has made the story of their love a touchstone for generations.
 
  "Tristan and Isolde" is not all love; in fact, it features large chunks of professionally done action, including fierce attacks, clandestine ambushes and copious amounts of smiting enemies with mighty swords. And the convincing look of the film, the success of cinematographer Arthur Reinhart and production designer Mark Geraghty in making us feel we're in a reasonable fantasy facsimile of Britain circa AD 500 is also a plus.
 
  Realism, however, goes only so far in "Tristan and Isolde." The happy couple inexplicably have access to a John Donne poem written a thousand years in the future, and clunky lines of dialogue on the order of "this is a dangerous game you're playing" and the ever-popular "God, what have I done?" make frequent appearances. This "Tristan" has its slightly silly moments, but rather like those fondly remembered epics of Hollywood past, its energy and entertainment value carry the day.

 Not all great love stories are the same; they just sometimes seem that way in Hollywood, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing. In the new studio release "Tristan & Isolde," the lovers of Celtic mythology, Arthurian legend and Wagnerian libretto fall for each other far from the violent, Dark Ages machinations plaguing their two warring peoples. Tucked in a cave, they find "a place for us" (see "West Side Story"), discover that "parting is such sweet sorrow" ("Romeo and Juliet") and learn, to their peril, that "men and women can't be friends because the sex part always gets in the way" ("When Harry Met Sally"). In between the panting and parting, two young actors are positioned, if somewhat prematurely, for stardom.  Directed by Kevin Reynolds and written by Dean Georgaris, whose toniest credit to date is the unnecessary remake of "The Manchurian Candidate" (he also wrote "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life"), "Tristan & Isolde" was once pegged as a project for Ridley Scott, who serves as one of its executive producers. The Sir Ridley connection may help explain the film's fine production values as well as the pervasive air of seriousness, both of which work to its advantage. Mr. Reynolds remains best known for the 1995 debacle "Waterworld" and has directed a handful of features since, most recently the indefensibly diverting "Count of Monte Cristo." Like that earlier period picture, "Tristan & Isolde" has nothing new to say about either love or filmmaking, but that, too, isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Critics often complain that Hollywood has nothing new to offer, but part of the appeal of the old studio system was the regularity of its offerings. One Fred and Ginger movie looks pretty much like another Fred and Ginger movie, only "Swing Time" is better than "Top Hat." We want movies to be different, but not radically so, which helps explain our enduring love for genre and stars. There is something reassuring in the knowledge that a film with Brad Pitt will at least give us the pleasure of his company (though of course you could end up falling asleep to "Meet Joe Black"). Just as there is something undeniably pleasant about an entertainment like "Tristan & Isolde" that delivers exactly what it promises, no less, no more.  To that end, what we get with this very familiar film are the winsome leads - James Franco as Tristan and Sophia Myles as Isolde - reading poetry that hadn't actually been written yet,  seminude in a cozy cave tucked into the Irish coast. Tristan, orphaned by the long battle between the English tribes and the Irish kingdom, has washed up on the emerald isle, wounded and in a state of extremely photogenic distress. Isolde, the daughter of the tyrannical Irish king, Donnchadh (the vigorous scene-chewer David Patrick O'Hara), has carted the wounded warrior into the cave, where she warms his body with hers and heals his wounds with medicinal herbs. Tristan soon recovers, only to fall into a more welcome state of helplessness when he casts eyes on his nurse. Fires are lighted, actual and metaphoric, followed by some discreet lovemaking.  It takes about 30 minutes longer than need be for it to go terribly wrong, but of course it does. Tristan returns home to his lord and surrogate father, Marke (a very effective Rufus Sewell), who is trying to join together the fractious English tribes against the Irish. In a scheme to wrest even more power, Isolde's super-mean father decides to auction her off to the best English warrior, and guess who that turns out to be. Tristan wins Isolde's hand, but not for himself. Isolde marries Marke and scurries around the palace with Tristan, throwing caution and perhaps even the fate of a unified nation to the wind. There are stolen kisses, beautiful hills, rousing battles and noble speeches about duty versus love. Happily, Enya is nowhere to be heard.  You've seen it all before; you'll see it all again.  "Tristan & Isolde" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). There is some fairly bloodless fighting and some very chaste lovemaking.

If dire expectations are generated by a throwaway early-January release of an upscale historical epic, there is a mild surprise in store with "Tristan & Isolde," a handsomely produced and sporadically rousing re-retelling of the ancient Celtic legend about star-crossed lovers. This understated period drama may lack sufficient star power and emotional wallop to score breakthrough success with mainstream auds during its domestic theatrical run, but pic could find a warmer response in the same international markets where "Kingdom of Heaven" redeemed itself last year. 
"Heaven" helmer Ridley Scott reportedly developed "Tristan & Isolde" for nearly two decades as a dream project. But even though he's credited here as executive producer -- along Tony Scott, his brother and Scott Free Prods. partner -- directorial chores have fallen to Kevin Reynolds ("Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves," "The Count of Monte Cristo"), who is no stranger to period pics involving sword-swinging and cross-bowing.
Working from a solid screenplay by Dean Georgaris ( "Manchurian Candidate" remake), Reynolds goes for brisk pacing and straightforward storytelling. He hits the mark more often than not, although he never really plumbs the tragic depths of the mythic tale that has inspired everything from a grand opera by Richard Wagner to, more recently, a trilogy of popular novels by Rosalind Miles.
In the Dark Ages according to Reynolds and Georgaris, England is an unstable land where rival tribes squabble ceaselessly after the fall of the Roman Empire. Irish king Donnchadh (David Patrick O'Hara) actively encourages the instability -- all the better to sustain Ireland's rule over England -- and occasionally sends his troops across the water to crush any attempts by the squabblers to forge alliances.
During an attack on a unification conference led by Lord Marke (Rufus Sewell), Irish soldiers kill the parents of a youngster named Tristan (Thomas Sangster). Marke takes the orphaned child home. But when the adult Tristan (James Franco) leads an attack on Irish invaders, he's wounded with a poison-drenched sword, and presumed dead. His companions rather too hastily place his body in a boat, and set the craft ablaze as it drifts away.
A miraculously unscorched Tristan is washed ashore on the Irish coast, where he's found and nursed back to health by beautiful Isolde (Sophia Myles). Trouble is, Isolde just happens to King Donnchadh's daughter, and Tristan remains ignorant of her lineage when he sets sail home to England. But when he returns, to compete as Marke's proxy in a tournament held by Donnchadh, Tristan learns the truth.
Isolde is the first prize in the tournament, but even though Tristan wins, under the rules, the victory means Isolde is betrothed to Marke.
For the next hour or so, Reynolds and Georgaris play the romantic triangle for all it's worth. But Franco is a bit too much the moist-eyed mope as Tristan, and his performance is too repetitious. Nonetheless, he is convincing in the rough-and-tumble action sequences capably staged by "Braveheart" stunt coordinator Nick Powell.
Myles reveals a few more colors on her palette while playing Isolde as an impulsive yet intelligent woman torn between duty and passion. Sewell subtly stokes the power of the central dramatic conflict with his unexpectedly sympathetic performance as Marke -- a visionary who's woefully blind as a man in love. Sewell skillfully underplays the climactic scenes as Marke progresses from betrayal to outrage to resignation.
O'Hara is a standout in the strong supporting cast.
Given the notorious vagaries of weather on the Irish coast, where much of the pic was shot, lenser Arthur Reinhart and editor Peter Boyle deserve kudos simply for seamlessly matching shots. Pic's tragic tone is effectively enhanced by the near-constant overcast look of daytime exteriors in Ireland and Czech Republic.
Many characters are too well-coiffed -- and too well-scrubbed -- to be credible in the Dark Ages setting. Overall, however, production values -- including Anne Dudley's Celtic-flavored score -- are first-rate.

Montague  and Capulet, Percy and Neville , G-Unit  and D-Block: Shall the cultural canon's ageless beefs ne'er be squashed? Tristan & Isolde  pits English against Irish in a Dark Ages derby match, with tragic titular lovers caught betwixt. Star-crossed brothers Tony and Sir Ridley of Scott, here producers, call this their "dream project," which allows them to sub claddagh for sandals in Ridley's swords-and fetish. Generous feudal lords are they, bequeathing directorial duties to squire Kevin Reynolds , who gave us Costner-in-Nottingham  and  Costner-with-gills. Middle Ages art direction proceeds as follows: rakishly hung bodices and loads of peat, trés de rigueur . Forgivably anachronistic, because we all get a bit metaphysical sometimes, Isolde (Sophia Myles ) reads from Donne's "The Good-Morrow," though a somnolent James Franco  seems in thrall to his woozy stare rather than his illicit beloved. Myles deserves better, but acquits herself as admirably as one can mired in medieval muck. I dub thee tolerable.
