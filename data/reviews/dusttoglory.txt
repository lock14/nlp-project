         In 1971, filmmaker Bruce Brown — previously noted for the surfing ode "Endless Summer" — helped kick-start an explosion of interest in the motorcycle world with his Oscar- nominated documentary "On Any Sunday." More than three decades later, Dana Brown, after asserting himself last year with the surfing documentary "Step Into Liquid," again follows in his father's footsteps (or should we say tire tracks?) with "Dust to Glory," a loud and boisterous but heartfelt chronicle of the 2003 Baja 1000 off-road race.
 
  The event was first officially staged in 1967 after the Mexican peninsula had become a magnet for dirt bike and dune buggy enthusiasts. It began as a fairly low-key affair but quickly gained notoriety and credibility via the participation of racing greats such as 1963 Indy 500 winner Parnelli Jones and celebrities Steve McQueen and James Garner. International exposure, including "ABC's Wide World of Sports," eventually led to the corporate-sponsored logistical behemoth it is today. More than 1,200 professional racers and weekend warriors — fearless and, yes, quite possibly nuts — drive and ride over a demanding course laid out each year by promoter Sal Fish.
 


         






    Dana Brown and his 90-person crew use 50 cameras and a helicopter to follow the 270 motorcycles, trophy trucks and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) as they tear through dirt, silt, sand and brush in bright sunlight and pitch dark to reach the finish line within the 32-hour window (although some will finish in half that time). Like his father, Brown inserts himself into the action via folksy narration. His husky, laid-back voice sounds something like Kevin Costner, lending a regular-guy aura to the reverential treatment he affords his subject.
 
  Considering his own pedigree, it's not surprising that Brown chooses to underscore the role family plays at the 1000, particularly the relationships of fathers and sons. One multigenerational story features JN Roberts, 62, who won the first Baja race in 1967, returning for the first time in 30 years to team with his son Jimmy on a motorcycle. Even motocross legend Malcolm Smith, a standout in "On Any Sunday," turns up with his son.
 
  The spine of the film is the journey of Mike "Mouse" McCoy, a Hollywood stuntman and Baja veteran who chooses to do the race solo on a motorcycle without the benefit of a teammate to spell him. Through McCoy, we see the extreme dedication that the athletes bring to the race. Practically incoherent at times and experiencing a series of mechanical challenges that are typical of the event, he perseveres well beyond the point of rationality.
 
  Brown spreads the narrative thin at times, introducing an awful lot of characters for a 94-minute movie, and the pace would benefit from a little breathing room to enjoy some of the thrilling images, but in the end it's a film built on emotion, not information. To some extent, that may be Brown's point. As in any endurance test, finishing is victory in itself, and Brown celebrates equally those who lead the pack and those who limp in, battered and bruised, half a day later while also commiserating with those whose luck — mechanical or otherwise — runs out somewhere in the desert.
 
  Although Brown is not interested in dissecting the event — you won't find anyone questioning the race's environmental effect on the Mexican terrain, for example — he is extremely adept at capturing what commentator Jim McKay used to refer to as "the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat."

In Dust to Glory , director Dana Brown attempts to do for souped-up cars and trucks and motorbikes and the daredevils who drive them what he did for the surf lords of Step Into Liquid . Every year since 1967, in the desert of Mexico, racers of every stripe have gathered for the Baja 1000, a full-throttle endurance race in which teams of badasses power any vehicle they choose along a thousand vicious miles of rocky, winding wilderness road. Anyone who wants to can enter, so that even though the contest is headlined by professionals with corporate sponsorships, the Baja 1000 has never quite lost its dune-buggy-to-hell aura of '60s anarchy. It turns out, however, that speeding along dirt roads isn't nearly as photogenic  or as varied  as surfing is. Brown fragments Dust to Glory  past all continuity, and his relentless gosh-wow! narration makes you wish he had taken the full leap from fan to filmmaker.

teve McQueen and James Garner, who drove in the Baja 1000 off-road race way back when, are listed as making cameo appearances in "Dust to Glory," a proudly rowdy down-home documentary about the 2003 run. Those appearances consist of a brief, silent glimpse of Mr. Garner and what must be an even briefer one of Mr. McQueen, because I'm not absolutely sure I saw him. Dana Brown, who wrote and directed, is the son of the documentary filmmaker Bruce Brown and worked on "The Endless Summer II," his father's surfing sequel. The younger Mr. Brown's new film is  the product of real enthusiasm and may appeal to moviegoers who share his devotion to this dangerous  race, which runs the length of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico, from Tijuana to La Paz. The event, first held in 1967, involves a wide variety of vehicles, including motorcycles, dune buggies, trophy trucks and unmodified pre-1982 Volkswagen Beetles. Judging from the comments of participants, the race's appeal seems to be the joy of telling stories about the ordeal later. One man, obviously an adrenaline addict, estimates that most people have 10,000 close calls in a lifetime, but anyone in this race has them all in one day, so that afterward "regular life feels like slow-motion." The racing champion Mario Andretti, grand marshal in 2003, does make a noteworthy appearance, and some of the race's old hands are interesting characters. J. N. Roberts, for instance, a winner of the first Baja 1000, is competing again at age 62. There is occasionally some gorgeous scenery, and the challenge of driving through silt is mildly interesting. (The secret of getting through it, they say, is never to let up on the gas.) "Dust to Glory" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some frightening driving and a spectator's accidental death.

Dana Brown brings surfing film kineticism to the auto racing world in "Dust to Glory," a kickass action docu that rams the viewer into the midst of the punishing Baja 1000 race. With its exceptional multicamera coverage and dynamic editing, pic provides an amazing ride across the dusty roads and stunningly varied terrain of what could be the world's most demanding vehicle race, with only a couple of tempo-reducing digressions and a late-stages tone of congratulatory back-slapping at all detracting from the excitement. The NASCAR crowd should eat this up, but the visceral impact is augmented by enough involving personal stories to give this April 1 IFC Films release a shot at a wider audience.
The son of "The Endless Summer" helmer Bruce Brown, Dana Brown scored a surfing classic of his own with "Step Into Liquid" in 2003. Here he turns his many lenses (more than 50) on an annual event that was launched in 1967, is open to anyone (professional and amateur alike), features vehicles worth from $10,000 to $2 million and takes place on the perilous roads, trails, back country dirt and beaches of Baja California.
Virtually without preliminaries, Brown revs up the engines, introducing participants and laying in info as he goes. A center, if there is one, is provided by pic's co-producer Mike "Mouse" McCoy, a pro motorcyclist since the age of 14 who alarmingly intends to ride the entire race himself. (Vehicles normally have teams of drivers who switch off. The record time for this endurance test is 16 hours, but it can take twice that.)Motorcycles leave the Ensenada starting line first, followed at intervals by 250 or so vehicles boasting all manner of modifications (Porsche-powered and heavily hydrolicized dune buggies that resemble lunar landers, muscle trucks on steroids) or none at all (a whole category is devoted to pre-1983 VW bugs).
It's immediately clear Brown intends to give "eat my dust" new cinematic meaning. Sensational p.o.v. shots from tiny cameras placed on bikes and cars create such a rapt sense of you-are-there involvement that you don't want to blink, and the dynamic achieved by intercutting these shots with footage taken from other moving cars and swooping helicopters, hyped even further by Nathan Furst's pulsating score, puts you on the edge of your seat.
It's not a question of suspense; although winning is obviously important to top pros like Robbie Gordon (the most intense driver glimpsed here), the big achievement at Baja is simply finishing. For the viewer, the most absorbing element is the conditions under which the race is conducted. After the drivers have roared off the starting line just after dawn on Nov. 19, 2003, great amusement ensues when some are pulled over by the Mexican Highway Patrol; for the part of the race run on normal thoroughfares that have not been closed for the occasion, drivers are expected to observe the rules of the road, including speed limits.
Much scarier is the situation around small villages and the dozen check points to which all vehicles must report, as at these unbarricaded locations dozens or hundreds of locals crowd around to get a good look at the action; pic contains several heart-stopping shots of marauding bikes and cars barely missing kids and others. In fact, one spectator was killed during the 2003 event.
Worst physical obstacle, especially for the bikes, would appear to be the silt, or fine-grain sand that billows up to create zero visibility while eliminating traction. Then there's the enveloping canopy of night, which makes getting lost in the desert a distinct possibility. Quite a few drivers are still out there at dawn the next morning, still hoping to finish before the 32-hour deadline.
Participants are profiled and interviewed sufficiently to provide a sense of them, but no more. There are numerous families, including three generations of McMillins, and JN Roberts (who won the first Baja in 1967) and son Jimmy; an all-female team; and 16-year-old Andy Stewart, who finishes sixth overall. Then there's the affable presence of racing god Mario Andretti, who served as grand marshal.
Perhaps sensing that the pedal-to-the-metal pace couldn't be sustained for more than 90 uninterrupted minutes, Brown makes a couple of pit stops of his own to introduce some eccentric characters connected to the race but has trouble getting fully back to speed thereafter. Concluding stretch rubs in we're-just-living-our-dream bonhomie to an unnecessary degree; the drivers are guys whose performance-in-action speaks for them and whose love for what they do is implicit.
Technical quality is outstanding in all regards.

Guess Who   Directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan   Columbia, in release
Professionally caustic and often brilliant, comedian Bernie Mac  still ain't got nothing on my pops and his friends. After I brought home a decidedly Nordic-featured lass (being a lighter shade of brown myself), my fatherwho, to his credit, won't spare his only son from a well-aimed jabshared with me what his friend had said after seeing my Nordiquette and me together: "Your boy done went Tiger Woods  on you." I had to smile because, well, that shit was funny, but funny because it hurt a little bitfunny because the hurt bled truth.
In Guess Who , Mac plays Spencer Tracy  to Ashton Kutcher 's Sidney Poitier  (yeah, I said it), racially inverting Stanley Kramer 's pointed, "pigmentation problem" classic, 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner . Kutcher isshockno Poitier, and his performance as Mac's prospective son-in-law is largely textureless. But the screenwriters deserve a cowardly lion's share of the blame. At times no more than a collection of comedic set piecesMac and Kutch sharing a bed, listening to "Ebony and Ivory," or racing go-kartsthe film is predictable and its humor is tension free, ultimately hurting only Mac, whose lifeblood is his threateningly melodic cadence and irresistible I-say-what-you-scared-to-say vibe. Mac's acidic humor is often predicated on a challenge, revealing the truth at the heart of every quiphis goading of Kutcher to tell black jokes over dinner is Guess Who 's sole piece of geniusand the script's lack of nerve fails to challenge him or its audience with enough dangerous humor.

BEAUTY SHOP    Directed by Bille Woodruff    MGM, opens March 30
A morality play paradoxically pimping self-reliance and community, 2002's Barbershop  stresses the importance of its titular location as a haven for free speech. After being chastised for his boneheaded dismissal of Rosa Parks 's achievements, Cedric the Entertainer 's character asks: "If we can't talk straight in a barbershop, then where can we talk straight?" An extended riff on its progenitor, Beauty Shop also offers opportunities for trenchant observation, though the clientele prefers kinky sex advice to sociopolitical chitchat. Girls just wanna have fun, and so does the film, which recycles the requisite moralizing into a breezy, sporadically funny package. Queen Latifah  takes the Ice Cube  role, playing a cosmetologist who ditches a ritzy Atlanta salon in order to beautify the ladies DIY-style. Highlights include a drive-by bitching from her former boss and a deus ex machina in the form of a pint-sized booty hound.
