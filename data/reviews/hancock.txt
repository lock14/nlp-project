In superhero comedy 'Hancock,' weaknesses outweigh strengths
Look up in the sky! Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Oh, for Pete's sake, it's Hancock. And he's drunk. Again.
Yes, Los Angeles's unreliable superhero is passed out on a city bench one minute and zooming intoxicated over the freeway to stop Uzi-toting gang-bangers the next. Before he almost kills them, he makes a blithe racist remark. It's like "Lethal Weapon" all over again, with one man doing the job of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover.
The idea of a sloshed, misanthropic superhero is a good one. The idea of putting him in a comedy is even better. Having Will Smith play the hero? Genius. And maybe some future global blockbuster will find a way to bundle it all into a thrilling work of entertainment.
In the meantime, there's "Hancock." What does one say about a movie that wants laughs from a shot of one inmate's head up the derriere of another? Well, there's "ouch." But there's also "why?"
"Hancock," which has a batch of sneak previews tonight before opening everywhere tomorrow, proudly bills its main character as "not your average superhero." By "average" the filmmakers presumably mean he is not made of iron or teeming with gamma rays. In other words, he's not from the universe of Marvel Comics. If only.
M. Night Shyamalan's "Un breakable" managed to create an original superhero out of Bruce Willis, with painstaking wonder. Wonder is what's missing here. "Hancock" staggers to the screen from a lousy script that seems written by focus group rather than by Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan, the credited typists.
With his stubbled, wool-hat-and-shorts look, Hancock appears virtually homeless. His reputation is in the toilet, so cue the down-on-his-luck PR agent (a characteristically droll Jason Bateman) to cajole Hancock into an image rehab. Soon Hancock is voluntarily off to jail (for some stupid, sub-"Oz" business). Then, he's released when the LAPD calls. Smith puts on a tight black costume, goes lawfully stiff, and gives us an amusing flash of how Richard Pryor might have played RoboCop.
The movie quickly runs aground when it has to explain itself. A back story is invented that I'm not convinced the filmmakers entirely understand. It's easier and more fun to show Hancock launching an obnoxious 12-year-old bully into the clouds or whipping a whale into the ocean than to disclose where the power to do so has come from.
There's the additional headache of what Charlize Theron is doing here. She doesn't figure into much of the film's advertising, but she plays Bateman's wife and, for half her scenes, she's reduced to badly darting her eyes whenever Hancock is around. If this were a murder-mystery board game, I'd accuse Ms. Theron in the ballroom with the Oscar.
Once she arrives, all the obscene snap goes out of Smith, and everyone's behavior makes even less sense. As a courtesy I won't be terribly specific, but the movie suggests a rather incredible racial odyssey. It culminates with an intriguing Hollywood metaphor for Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's endless tussle for the Democratic nomination.
The makers of "Hancock" had an opportunity to write a cool ticket (movie, not presidential). But the film has a depressing lack of imagination. And having Smith play a superhero seems redundant, since for years his superpower involved making Hollywood lots of money on the Fourth of July.
"Hancock" probably won't disrupt the trend. Yet once the vulgar comedy dissipates, we're left with poorly photographed, bullet-riddled summer-action mayhem. The only thing drunker than Hancock is the editing and camerawork. Director Peter Berg ("Friday Night Lights," "The Kingdom") has a knack for movies with a bulldozing style. But he usually finds a way to balance the noise with either gags or solemnity. This time his filmmaking is as woozy and gratuitously belligerent as his hero.
Berg, a former actor, also leaves his stars in the lurch. Smith and Theron wear an expression I've never seen on them before. It's called, "What's my motivation?" And obligated to feel something trudging out of the theater, I was left in the lurch, too. What's mine?


In the screwed-up summer diversion Hancock , Will Smith   plays a disheveled, hard-drinking, Los Angeles-based superhero referred to on the street by cute kids and peaceful oldies alike as an a--hole. The designation is a punch line in itself, uttered throughout the movie with a glee that challenges profanity conventions in a mainstream publication, since one of the feats Smith sets for himself in his latest attempt at Fourth of July box office superheroism is to apply his kryptonite-resistant personal likability to a character who is, at first glance, a real schmuck. After some sort of accident, the reluctant crimestopper doesn't know who he is or why he's in L.A. (hence the generic name John Hancock); he just knows he possesses otherworldly talents for flying and hurling automobiles, among other attributes useful for surviving in the City of Angels. And at first close encounter, he's an alcohol-soaked curmudgeon with a bum's wardrobe and a really bad attitude. Even those he saves wish he would go be a hero somewhere else.
Hancock can revel in schmuckery, of course, because you and I and cute kids and peaceful oldies worldwide know in advance that there's no way on Hollywood's green earth Will Smith will ever play someone seriously, dangerously unsavory. Charm is the star's armor on either side of the alien-human divide, whether he's a Fresh Prince, a Bad Boy, a Man in Black, the last man alive in New York City, or Muhammad Ali. And so, in the beginning, the movie  part comedy, part action-thriller, and a whole lot of earnest, addled mush about purpose, fate, and angels  lets Smith (who is also one of the producers) have fun goofing on all that has already served him so well as a performer: Here's a hero in need of remedial charm school.
In the story's most original notion (the script is credited to first-timer Vy Vincent Ngo and X-Files    staff writer Vince Gilligan), Hancock saves a PR executive named Ray (Jason Bateman  ). In addition to inviting the hungry superhero over for a thank-you dinner of spaghetti, meatballs, and family togetherness with his dubious, dewy wife (Charlize Theron  ) and their bright sprite of a son (Friday Night Lights   ' Jae Head), Ray gets the idealistic brainstorm to rehabilitate Hancock with a personalized image makeover. He aims to turn the mutt into a better person as well as a more super hero. The PR pro also harbors an unabashedly idealistic desire to make the world a better place by encouraging rich companies to donate lifesaving products to the poor  a business goal that, no matter how noble, comes across like an unasked-for lesson in a movie released when school's out.
The scenes of Hancock improving his presentation skills, complete with a Queer Eye -ready custom costume, are droll, with a big assist from Bateman and the attitude of controlled exasperation he perfected on Arrested Development   . (Ray's wife is more skeptical of Hancock's capacity for rehabilitation, and she demonstrates that by giving their guest what appears to be the stink eye. Their son seems to think the visitor is as cool as Will Smith.) But then the movie goes someplace else, a direction not to be revealed except to say that Hancock  the jaunty, jokey riff on the screwed-up inner emotional life of a traditionally ironclad superhero becomes Hancock  the icky lesson in the importance of personal responsibility, loyalty, and continued family togetherness. Also, of making the world a better place, and keeping Will Smith's income steady.
And, oh yes, there's that talk of angels, or is it some sci-fi race of extraterrestrials who'd feel at home in Battlefield Earth   ? To further confound clarity, director Peter Berg   (The Kingdom   ) and cinematographer Tobias Schliessler favor a visual style that can best be described as Serious Focus on the Eyeball. Arty, randomly inserted extreme close-ups on a quadrant of Smith's lovely face, or Theron's, or Bateman's, are meant to convey intensity of emotional content. Really, what moviegoers hanker for is a hero to step in and adjust the depth of focus to something suitable for a cute movie about a magical dude who smashes tall buildings with a single bound.

 Soon into the superhero spectacular “Hancock,” before the machinery has fully kicked in, and the story is still wreathed in blissful ambiguity, you see the star Will Smith sprawled on a Los Angeles bench. Dirty, disheveled, in full distressed costume and character, and within easy sloshing reach of a bottle, he looks lost and alone, much like all the human detritus that washes up in every city and remains mostly unnoticed. But there’s no ignoring Hancock, who has amazing powers. He can fly, for starters, and soon enough he’s blasting straight into the heavens, the first homeless superhero in movies  —  Superbum!  Alas (bummer), though he can look the part, Hancock isn’t literally homeless, just rootless, troubled and bedeviled. He drinks hard, swears at children (who curse him in turn), rarely shaves, never smiles. Worse, he has lousy superhero style, with sneakers and shorts (no cape), a grubby watch cap pulled over his forehead and buggy sunglasses that hide his (X-ray?) eyes. His takeoffs and landings are a mess: sloppy and violent, they invariably leave a heap of trouble and general rubble in his wake. He’s Pothole Man, Train Wreck Man, but mainly he’s Seriously Ticked Off Man, which, given that he’s also a black man in Los Angeles, suggests that this superhero story comes with some bite, even a few nibbling sharp teeth.  Although whatever teeth it had have mostly been pulled, “Hancock” makes for one unexpectedly satisfying and kinky addition to Hollywood’s superhero chronicles. Touching and odd, laden with genuine twists and grounded by three appealing lead performances, it was ably directed by Peter Berg and written by Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan. It’s a curious movie for the week of July 4, when the air is traditionally filled with the rockets’ red glare and muscular box office heroics. There’s a real jolt in the choking, splenetic exhaust of a disgruntled blockbuster anti-hero, especially one played by the affable Mr. Smith, who 12 years ago this very week helped save the world in “Independence Day,” a movie that made blowing up the White House into a joke.  That was then, this is now, and while it would be a stretch to say that this summertime amusement has much on its mind, it does have a little something percolating between its big bangs and gaudy effects. Most of that something isn’t overtly political, despite the setup (Super Angry Black Man), a few winking asides and Mr. Berg’s downbeat tendencies. Mr. Smith may be playing a provocative role in a city famous for its troubled race relations, but he’s also a megastar and largely shielded from everyday stings, which, as it happens, is also true of his character. Hancock kicks back in a couple of derelict trailers (the Shack of Solitude) instead of a mansion, but his pain is existential, not material. He suffers at his leisure.  Engineered for broad, knowing laughs, with lots of kablooey, “Hancock” is principally a comedy and for a while plays out that way, notably when Mr. Smith is interacting with Jason Bateman. Their characters meet cute when Hancock saves Ray (Mr. Bateman) from being flattened by a freight train. In typical fashion, Hancock botches the save. He plucks Ray from death, but in the process derails the train and, also true to bad form, receives an invective-laced earful from the gathering mob. Struck by the crowd’s hostility, Ray, a public relations guy with a do-gooder streak and a knockout wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), decides to rescue Hancock in turn by giving him a superhero makeover, one that follows a course blazed by many a fallen star (contrition, redemption, fabulousness).  Mr. Berg, who explored heroism of a different stripe in his poignant high school football movie, “Friday Night Lights,” and showed off terrific action chops in the underrated flick “The Kingdom,” is not a comedy natural. He squeezes laughs out of “Hancock”  —  Mr. Bateman needs no goosing  —  though some of its biggest yuks are fairly yucky, like a cringing bit involving a bizarre variant on prison rape. (That’s entertainment?) For the most part, what Mr. Berg does is bring gravity to “Hancock,” a heaviness that can feel lugubrious even in midair though it often seems just right for a lonely, walking-if-usually-flying, seemingly self-loathing question mark. Mr. Berg takes the character’s complications to heart, and Mr. Smith, his charm and smile dimmed, does the same.  The extent of that complexity doesn’t emerge until the big reveal, which involves Ms. Theron’s character and is so surprising that I heard several grown men loudly gasp. (“No way!”) I was more struck by Ms. Theron, an actress who, I think, is capable of greater depth than most of her performances require, even those that try to rub the glamour off her. She helps Mr. Smith enrich the story’s emotional texture, which is no small thing, since the movie itself starts to falter just when it begins to deepen. That’s too bad because while “Hancock” is far from perfect  —  it feels overly rushed, particularly toward its chaotic end  —  it has a raggedness that speaks honestly to the fundamental human fragility that makes the greatest heroes super.  “Hancock” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Big bangs, bruising battles and movie blood.

An intriguing high concept is undermined by low-grade dramaturgy in �Hancock.� This misguided attempt to wring a novel twist on the superhero genre has a certain whiff of �The Last Action Hero� about it, with Will Smith playing an indestructible crime-buster in a pointedly real-world context. Although it will inevitably open very large, this odd and perplexing aspiring tentpole will provide a real test of Smith�s box office invincibility. 
The central idea of Vy Vincent Ngo and Vince Gilligan�s script -- of Smith�s John Hancock being an ornery, unwilling hero who escapes from his ordained role in life via booze and general cantankerousness -- is amusing and plausible enough to sustain the first section of the film. What the writers and director Peter Berg do with the concept in the end, however, is nowhere near sufficiently thought out, and narrative illogic and missed opportunities plague the film increasingly as it cartwheels through its surprisingly brief running time.
When the world-famous Hancock reluctantly swings into action -- he can fly at supersonic speed, lift any weight and is impervious to all weapons -- his drunken recklessness invariably causes more damage than it�s worth. Although valuable to the police, Hancock has a bad name with the public for his destructiveness, impudence and all-around bad attitude; an adjunct to this is his foul language, which treads the very edge of PG-13 permissiveness and will no doubt catch many July 4 weekend kid-herding parents unhappily unaware.
As much in need of rehab as this week�s tabloid celebrity, the raggedly attired Hancock finds an eager savior in PR whiz Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman). Rescued from certain death by the rasty hero, Ray returns the favor by inviting him to dinner with wife Mary (Charlize Theron) and son Aaron (Jae Head) and announcing he�s going to remake Hancock�s image. The strongman�s first step will be to submit to rehab and anger-management training, along with some prison time (although Hancock resists wearing an actual superhero outfit because it�s too �homo�). What he shortly does to two tough-talking inmates in the pen crudely literalizes the taunt about sticking your head where the sun don�t shine.
Such vulgar goofiness is one thing in an Adam Sandler film, but doesn�t sit well in the rough-and-ready realism of Berg�s raw visuals, which grievously misapply hand-held jitteriness to material that demands more precise stylization. 
The genre satire and numerous Will Smith moments, with the star throwing off the attitude-laden quips and looks auds expect from him, carry the first half without too much trouble, in anticipation of where the film will go from there.
Where it goes, unfortunately, is right down the tubes. All along, there�s something oddly hostile about Mary�s attitude toward Hancock, and at the 55-minute mark, a major revelation sends the story veering off into territory that feels unmapped even in the minds of the filmmakers. All the potential the premise seemed to offer is frittered away, mind-boggling gaps of logic come to the fore, and arbitrary plot devices serve to shortchange a story that could have gone in much more interesting directions.
Even in his derelict state, why would the presumably super-studly Hancock have no lady friends? Why would humiliated criminals ever think they could strike back at their nemesis? More broadly speaking, what about an invincible superhero who could take power into his own hands and become a self-appointed dictator who arbitrates on good and evil, sometimes to ill effect? Putting a character like Hancock in the recognizable modern world, rather than in a cartoonish context, creates all sorts of possibilities that are willfully ignored by the filmmakers, who instead have come up with a concoction that is both overwrought and severely undernourished.
That said, the effects are snazzy, even if they pass by quite quickly, and there�s enough going on to keep audiences watching, if not entirely happy. Smith, Theron and Bateman capably handle the main roles, but such is the skimpiness of the scenario that no further characters make any impact. 


The Sixth Sense , starring Bruce Willis  as a dead man, was writer-director M. Night Shyamalan 's breakthrough, but its follow-up, Unbreakable , starring Bruce Willis as the walking dead reborn as a superhero, was the filmmaker's masterpiece. It remains the most quietly influential of all recent superhero movies, the unacknowledged template for directors looking to make the indestructible vulnerable, the enormously heroic smaller than life. Shyamalan, now on the outs with former fanboys who bemoan storytelling that's turned to navel-gazing, stripped comic books of their fantastical, silly excesses and got to the meat of the matter: The noblest hero is one who overcomes doubt and fear to save the world.
There are hints of that greatness buried deep within Hancock , a superhero movie starring a hero who doesn't want the job. As the unbreakable title character, Will Smith  is a Man of Steel who'd rather melt into a puddle of cheap booze. Like Willis's David Dunn , John Hancock  knows he has a calling—he'd just rather not pick up. Both men mope and wander and kvetch, till someone comes along to shake them out of their stupor and remind them that they are, in fact, quite super.
Which isn't to suggest that Hancock  is a worthy heir to Unbreakable , not by a giant leap in a single bound. It's too silly and too slight to merit such praise, especially as it trudges through its first third with ho-hum jokes tethered to rinky-dink special effects. Hancock 's so indefensibly enh  during its first half-hour that it almost doesn't recover; like its hero, the movie comes off as a touch suicidal.
But slowly, and clumsily, Hancock  lurches toward greatness. Its redemption occurs long after the film has spent scene after scene—all present in the ubiquitous trailers—proving that Hancock is an alcoholic and an asshole: cruel to children, criminal toward criminals, and a menace to Los Angeles. Smith, clad in tatters and covered in grime, plays him like an alky Ali; Hancock is beefy, hung-over, pissed off, and spoiling for a fight.
Even after he meets his redeemer— Jason Bateman  as Ray Embrey, the first heroic public-relations man in the history of cinema—we're reminded over and over of Hancock's misguided, destructive, half-assed acts of heroism. The joke wears exhaustingly thin, and Hancock  stalls. But finally, and so gradually that it may test your patience, the movie unspools its darkest and deepest-felt secrets—the origin story that's really never fully revealed, accompanied by Hancock's admission that he's a son of a bitch because he can't remember being anything but alone, unloved, unwanted. "What kind of a bastard must I have been," he tells Ray and his wife Mary (Charlize Theron ), "for nobody to claim me?"
Hancock is meant to be a hero; it's his purpose. Only he doesn't know why and he doesn't know how. Neither, it seems, do director Peter Berg  and writers Vince Gilligan  and Vincent Ngo . All seem unsure of how to transition the title character from bum to superman, and rely too heavily on broad comedy's shove or overheated action's kick. Part of this stems from Berg's directorial style: herky-jerky cameras shoved in folks' faces and up their noses. It worked well when he was illuminating cousin Buzz Bissinger 's Friday Night Lights  ; not so much during his bloodthirsty trek through The Kingdom  last year. There's nothing subtle about Berg's bludgeoning style; he directs angry .
But when he's exhausted enough to pause for the deep breath, Berg stumbles across scenes from a better movie, as when Hancock turns himself in to the authorities and lands in prison. Or the moment when Hancock discovers that he's not, in fact, alone, and when good news goes bad. Or even the scenes during which Ray attempts, rather futilely, to sell corporate America on the idea of giving to a cause.
Fact is, Hancock 's more Ray's heroic journey than its title character's. Bateman, who's affable and genuine whenever onscreen, plays nothing more than an everyday do-gooder whose Batmobile is a piece-of-shit Volvo  and whose sidekicks are a wife with a long neck and a wary eye and a son (Jae Head ) who just wants to believe . Bateman and Smith make a dynamic duo: Smith, whose widescreen sincerity remains his greatest asset, beautifully communicates the transition from shithead to champion.
Last week on The Colbert Report  , Smith proclaimed Hancock  as nothing more than another summer superhero movie, which is its biggest flaw: It doesn't take itself as seriously as it should, and undercuts a final act that should have and so could have packed a mighty emotional wallop. Noted a colleague after a preview screening: "Here's a superhero movie that could have used more pretension."
