In 'Cadillac Records,' the music's electrifying but the details are murky
If, as Muddy Waters once sang, the blues had a baby and they named it rock and roll, then Chess Records was the delivery room. The little record label birthed the overamped all-American yawp known as Chicago blues, exemplified by Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter, and other impolite black men with harmonicas and guitars. Then, just as that sound was making inroads into white teen America, Chess turned around and launched Chuck Berry like a duck-walking nuclear bomb.
It's a hell of a story, and "Cadillac Records" wants to tell it so badly that it threatens to warp the narrative out of recognition. Writer-director Darnell Martin ("I Like It Like That," TV's "Their Eyes Were Watching God") gets the larger point straight - Chicago blues was a black cultural eruption that was strip-mined by white entrepreneurs and the white mainstream - while fudging the particulars. How seriously can you take a movie that pretends one of the Chess brothers doesn't even exist?
That would be Phil, who's still alive and presumably didn't sell Martin the rights to his life. So "Cadillac Records" becomes the story of Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody), a Polish immigrant Jew who all by himself sets up a studio on Chicago's South Side and invites in a Mississippi sharecropper named McKinley Morganfield (Jeffrey Wright). Under the stage name of Muddy Waters, the latter proceeds to blow the roof off the sucker.
The music, appropriately, is electrifying, and the performances on-target (the actors are really singing rather than lip-synching, a risky choice that mostly works). Wright is fairly reined-in as Muddy - the editing flaunts his relentless womanizing more than anything the actor does - but he has harmonica player Little Walter (a live-wire Columbus Short) to act as mentally unstable id to his superego. More threatening is the appearance of the rival bluesman Howlin' Wolf, portrayed with lethally serene calm by Eamonn Walker ("Oz"). Walker's so good, so there, as Wolf, that when the movie glides on by him, you feel the hurt.
But "Cadillac Records" has a lot on its plate: bringing on Mos Def as a high-spirited Chuck Berry and showing how white culture and the singer's penchant for teenage girls brought him low; sketching out the particulars of payola (Eric Bogosian appears as the influential DJ Alan Freed); positing Etta James as Leonard Chess's very own Diana Ross.
Here's where the movie becomes wish fulfillment rather than a dramatization of known events. Even with what appears to be 30 pounds of prosthetic caboose, Beyoncé Knowles (who gets an executive producing credit) in no way, shape, or form resembles the tough, tiny bulldog that James was at this stage of her career. The implication, too, that she was the great love of Chess's life is at odds with the record. But Beyoncé sings the bejesus out of "At Last," and that counts for something - just don't expect the real Etta.
No wonder Wright seems to be pouting, though; "Cadillac Records" has left Muddy Waters and the other bluesmen (including an underused Cedric the Entertainer as songwriter/narrator Willie Dixon) high and dry in its desire to pack it all in. (Another recent, as-yet-unreleased film version of the Chess Records story, Jerry Zaks's "Who Do You Love," doesn't even deal with James.) In fairness, the culture also left these men behind, at least until the British Invasion groups repaid the debt. In this movie's cracked chronology, the Rolling Stones arrive at Chess to record and pay obeisance some three years ahead of schedule.
And still: No Phil Chess. That's like saying Orville Wright was single-handedly responsible for the invention of the airplane. Fifty years on, we're still living with the aftershocks of what Muddy and Wolf invented and the Chess brothers midwived, but it's in the air and not yet on the screen.


Cadillac Records , the story of a rowdy musical revolution and the record label that helped to launch it, begins in 1941, when Muddy Waters (Jeffrey Wright) is a sharecropper playing slide guitar under the blazing hot Mississippi sun. Heading up to Chicago, he electrifies that guitar and hooks up with Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody), a nice Jewish boy who's been looking to do something not so nice. Chess opens a nightclub, where the performances sometimes end in gunfire, and when the club burns down, he starts to record the new sounds he's been featuring there. His label, Chess Records, is a Midwestern precursor to Sun Records, located behind a storefront (with rotating vinyl logo) on Chicago's South Side. When the records sell, he gives each of his musicians a new Cadillac, neglecting to mention that it came out of their royalties.
It's tempting to say Cadillac Records  is about the moment that the blues turned into rock & roll. Only that wouldn't be true. The film's boisterous fun kicks off from its recognition that the blues already was  rock & roll; no ''transformation'' was necessary. The writer-director Darnell Martin, who made the tough and nimble I Like It Like That  (1994), is out to capture those days in all their proud, violent glory. She blasts rhythm & blues out of its museum-piece quaintness. Cadillac Records  lacks a center  Leonard is more like a hub (he isn't sketched in)  yet it's an enjoyable ramble, with a feel for what made the early days of rock as wild as any that followed.
Wright plays Waters as an elegant tomcat in boxy suits who doesn't pretend he can love one woman at a time. His street counterpart is Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker), a scary customer who stares at Chess from behind the recording-studio glass with a look of barely contained homicide. Then there's Chuck Berry  played by Mos Def, who nails the legend's apple-cheeked charisma as well as his saucy grooves. Just as Berry cracks the pop charts, he's sidetracked by the law. (Coincidence? You decide.) His slot gets filled by Etta James, a torch rocker and junkie played by Beyoncé Knowles, who just about burns a hole in the screen with her sultry torment. As a woman who rocked the house but could get no satisfaction, Beyoncé does a Lady Sings the Blues  in miniature. Now will someone give this lady a great lead role?

 In “Cadillac Records,” Darnell Martin’s rollicking and insightful celebration of Chicago blues in its hectic golden age, Jeffrey Wright plays the singer and guitarist Muddy Waters. This feat is made even more impressive and interesting when you reflect that in the same movie season Mr. Wright has portrayed another notable real-life African-American, the former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in Oliver Stone’s “W.” The man is equally credible as a statesman and a bluesman. If that’s not range, what is?  Much more than racial typecasting or clever mimicry is at work in these performances. Mr. Wright can hardly be said to bear a strong physical resemblance to Muddy Waters or Mr. Powell — or, for that matter, to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whom he played in the HBO film “Boycott,” or to the painter Jean-Michel Basquiat, so brilliantly impersonated in “Basquiat.”  Rather, Mr. Wright, as protean and serious an actor as any working in American movies, seems to be writing his own version of “Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Black Man,” the literary scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr.’s collection of essays on various styles of African-American manhood.  In each case, whether playing a former soldier or a tormented artist, Mr. Wright directs our attention away from the familiar, public face of the character in question toward a private zone where ambition struggles with anxiety, and where what seems to be at stake is nothing less than the integrity and viability of the self. And so, in his Muddy Waters, we see pride, ambition and uncertainty cohabiting with musical genius, sexual appetite and stubborn professionalism.  “Cadillac Records” is by no means Mr. Wright’s film alone, and his work is enriched by the skill and verve of a prodigious ensemble. The film is not — thank goodness — another dutiful musical biopic, but rather the group portrait of a remarkable, volatile constellation of artists, including Little Walter (Columbus Short), Chuck Berry (Mos Def), Etta James (Beyoncé Knowles), Howlin’ Wolf (Eamonn  Walker) and Willie Dixon, the bassist and songwriter who narrates in the mellow, countrified voice of Cedric the Entertainer.  These musical innovators are gathered together — promoted, exploited and given shiny new Caddies with heavy strings attached — by Leonard Chess (Adrien Brody), a Jewish entrepreneur in postwar Chicago who sees “race music” as a potential gold mine. That it also turns out to be an agent of wholesale cultural transformation — an old song observes that the blues had a baby, and they called it rock ’n’ roll — does not faze him in the least.  Few subjects are as encrusted with legend, hyperbole and sheer bunk as the history of American popular music, and there will no doubt be pedants who will object to some of the liberties “Cadillac Records” has taken with the literal truth. At times Leonard Chess seems so stressed out by running the record company bearing his name that you wish he had, say, a brother to share the burden. The real Leonard Chess did, but for now Phil Chess will have to join Nesuhi Ertegun, brother of Ahmet, in the ranks of music industry siblings neglected by Hollywood.  In any case, Ms. Martin, who wrote as well as directed “Cadillac Records,” does not need to lean too heavily on the historical record, or on the dreary conventions of pop-culture hagiography,  because she has a clear and complicated set of ideas about her characters and a deep appreciation of the music they made. It is, sadly, all too rare for a movie about important musicians to pay intelligent attention to the sounds and idioms that make their lives worth dramatizing in the first place.  But in “Cadillac Records” you hear most of the important advances and developments that defined urban blues in the 1940s and ’50s. When Muddy Waters, newly arrived in Chicago from Mississippi, plugs his guitar into an amplifier, a new sonic mutation occurs. Then Chuck Berry comes along, playing in a speedier, country-inflected style that makes him the first major star to cross from the R&B to the pop charts.  “Cadillac Records” would be worth seeing for the music alone. Mr. Wright’s renditions of Muddy Waters’s signature songs are more than respectable, while Ms. Knowles’s interpretations of Ms. James’s hits — “At Last” and “I’d Rather Go Blind,” in particular — are downright revelatory.  And so, it should be said, is Ms. Knowles’s performance. In her previous film roles she has seemed guarded and tentative, as if worried that her charisma would melt from too much emotional heat. Here, playing a needy, angry, ferociously talented and fantastically undisciplined woman, she is as volcanic and voluptuous as an Italian movie star. Or, more to the point, a real soul diva of the old school.  The music is also a window into history, and “Cadillac Records” is an uncommonly astute treatment of race in America at the end of the Jim Crow era. Its dense, anecdotal narrative is built around the sometimes uneasy friendship between Leonard Chess and Muddy Waters, his first big star. Chess is devoted to his artists, but he also profits from their art, and Mr. Brody shows him to be neither a paragon of racial enlightenment nor a predator.  “His job is to make money off you,” Howlin’ Wolf says to Muddy Waters, who is hurt by what he sees as Chess’s double-dealing. “You’re from Mississippi. I thought you would have known that.”  The rivalry between those two bluesmen is another source of intrigue in “Cadillac Records,” which sustains a remarkable number of dramatically important relationships, any one of which could have been a movie in its own right. Muddy Waters is also a mentor to Little Walter — a troubled, reckless, brilliant harmonica player — and a steadfast (if unfaithful) husband to Geneva (Gabrielle Union). Chess, meanwhile, though he is married (his wife, Revetta, is played by Emmanuelle Chriqui) is nearly undone by his passion for Etta James.  So much passion, so much pain, so much tenderness and violence. If you dig up an album from the heyday of Chess Records, you’ll find all that and more. And “Cadillac Records” is nearly as good as one of those albums, which is saying a lot. This movie is crowded and sprawling, and if it rambles sometimes, that’s just fine. Like those big, boxy Caddies (and like Howlin’ Wolf, if he did say so himself), it’s built for comfort, not for speed. It hums, it purrs and it roars.  “Cadillac Records” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has smoking, swearing, sex and mayhem in excess, which is just the right amount.

Approaching the blues with the enthusiasm of an overcaffeinated brass band, helmer Darnell Martin nonetheless makes some kind of music with the percolating '50s biopic "Cadillac Records" -- mostly because she mines a righteous, mythic sensibility out of the story of Leonard Chess, Muddy Waters and the birth of the Chicago blues. Jeffrey Wright's Waters is unforgettable, Eamonn Walker gives an unnerving performance as rival bluesman Howlin' Wolf, and Beyonce Knowles' Etta James should put bottoms in seats.
The second feature this year to focus on the same musicians, "Cadillac Records" takes a far broader approach than Jerry Zaks' "Who Do You Love,"' which concentrated more on the conflicted character of Chess than on the artists he hired, promoted, profited from and, some say, exploited. In "Cadillac Records," Adrien Brody cuts an appropriately oily figure as the man who founded Chess Records in 1956, while Wright delivers a performance of eloquent, simmering dignity as Waters -- the first Chess star, one of the great vocalists in American music and the dramatic engine of Martin's film.
Working off her own well-researched screenplay, Martin goes so far as to have Chess' path crossed by shadowy, muttering figures. "I've lost daughters to bluesmen," they warn him outside the black nightclub he plans to open. "It's a dangerous business you in." No kidding: At the Club Macambo, where Chess starts booking local talent, the so-called Headhunters barge in -- Waters, harmonica virtuoso Little Walter (Columbus Short) and guitarist Jimmy Rogers (Kevin Mambo). They take over the stage, fists are thrown and someone pulls a gun. Chess does the smart, politic thing and hires the invaders.
He also starts recording Waters, whose "I Can't Be Satisfied" puts them all on the map. Bookending narration provided by Cedric the Entertainer, seriously miscast as the great songwriter Willie Dixon, tells the story of Chess' expansion, his paying off of disc jockeys, his fostering of the unstable Little Walter, Waters' marriage to steady, long-suffering Geneva Wade (Gabrielle Union), the clash between Waters and Howlin' Wolf (by all accounts one of the most ferocious blues performers ever -- and Walker makes you believe it), and the eventual signing of the troubled James (Knowles), whose "At Last" becomes one of the label's real crossover hits.
One suspects Martin is a convert, one who might have come to the blues unconvinced but came away a fire-and-brimstone evangelist for the music and its people -- which is good, because an overfamiliarity with the minutiae might have strangled what is, on a very basic level, a solid story. Most of the details are right-on in "Cadillac Records," though the director's efforts to sell it sometimes steers the film into mawkish or hokey territory.
Where it's dead serious, though, is as a racial parable that couldn't be timelier. Chess Records was a mixed marriage -- the owner was a Polish immigrant, his artists were African-American, and much of the America they inhabited was hostile to any such arrangement. This all comes to a head after Chess signs Chuck Berry (a dryly funny Mos Def), whose hybridized pop sound had some promoters thinking he was a white country singer.
Berry is the guy who puts Chess over the top; as someone says, they're not sure what he's playing, but it's not the blues. But it sells, and it bridges the racial divide: In a scene duplicated in "Who Do You Love," the velvet ropes separating whites and blacks at a Berry concert are toppled by the audience. That Martin later has Knowles reprise the entire racial psychology of America through James and her seemingly insoluble identity problems, by contrast, is overkill; Knowles gives a soulful portrayal, but her part of the movie seems to exist in another dimension entirely.
As Waters' self-destructive protege, Short brings blood and soul to a classic role -- a kind of prince of the blues who eventually becomes torn over whether to revere the king or dethrone him.
The music -- most of it performed by the actors themselves -- has a real richness to it, if not quite the muscle of the Chess records themselves. Recording sessions are shot like live concerts; the club gigs feel sweaty and smoky. And Def's Berry performances succeed in capturing what it felt like when the blues had a baby and they named it rock 'n' roll.


For a film "based on a true story"—that of Leonard and Phil Chess 's eponymous record label, featuring the likes of Muddy Waters  (Jeffrey Wright ), Howlin' Wolf (Eamonn Walker ), Etta James  (Beyoncé Knowles ), and Chuck Berry  (Mos Def )—there doesn't seem to be a single fact contained within writer-director Darnell Martin 's ham-fisted fiction, which renders pre-rock musical history as yet another downer soap opera bloated with smack and sex and premature corpses. For all its copious flaws, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story  perfectly nailed the trajectory of every single rockudrama that has tarnished a legend's legend—the big bang turned sad whimper. In this version—told in flashback, no less, with overwrought narration provided by Cedric the Entertainer  as Chess producer, session musician, and house songwriter Willie Dixon —there is no Phil Chess, only Leonard, played by an actor, Adrien Brody , who, with his anachronistically tousled hair and Forever Fonzie wardrobe, looks as much like Leonard Chess  as he does, well, Howlin' Wolf. Fabrications in the name of movie myth-making are, of course, to be expected from a genre that demands condensing a life into a handful of Defining Episodes; all biopics reduce and trivialize. But so egregious are the deficiencies and distortions here—in this universe, the Rolling Stones  came to the U.S., and the Beach Boys  ripped off Chuck Berry long before anyone had ever heard of Elvis Presley —that it's almost impossible to discern whether there's anything decent about the moviemaking itself. With everything so wrong, how can there be anything right about Cadillac Records ?
