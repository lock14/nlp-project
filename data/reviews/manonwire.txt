French high-wire artist Philippe Petit was 24 in 1974 when, in one of the great guerrilla-art spectacles of our time, he walked a wire he and his accomplices had illegally strung from one not-quite-finished World Trade Center tower to the other. There, 1,350 feet up from the sidewalk, he danced in the air for nearly an hour between what were then the world's tallest buildings. Later, the man with the elfin face and catlike feet was arrested, sent to a shrink, released  and celebrated around the world.
The empty space where those Twin Towers once stood is never acknowledged in Man on Wire , James Marsh's breathtaking documentary about that mad-genius ''coup'' (as Petit calls it) achieved over three decades ago. And that choice itself is a kind of daring high-wire act: For the duration of this film, the towers are solid again. This is about what happened then , the quest and the realization, told by the colorful dreamers who made it happen, and balanced by Marsh with a lovely sense of rhythm, wit, and wonder. Petit himself is a lithe and mesmerizing narrator with (not surprisingly) a flair for the dramatic, even in words. Equally marvelous is Annie Allix, then Petit's girlfriend, who finds les mots justes  to describe the challenge, triumph, and aftermath back on earth. The gorgeous music includes Ralph Vaughan Williams' wafting tone poem ''The Lark Ascending''  apt in describing an artist who might well be part bird.

 On the morning of Aug. 7, 1974, after months of preparation and years of dreaming, a French daredevil named Philippe Petit stepped into the sky above Lower Manhattan. For almost 45 minutes he ambled back and forth on a metal cable strung between the towers of the World Trade Center, a feat of illegal tightrope walking that, according to a New York Police Department sergeant who recounted Mr. Petit’s act of physical poetry in dry press-conference prose, would more aptly be described as dancing.  For many years after, Mr. Petit’s stunt was a cherished footnote in the annals of New York history, one of the touchstones of a crazy, awful, glittering era in the life of the city. The destruction of the twin towers in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, revived the memory of that earlier aesthetic assault on the buildings, which is now the subject of “Man on Wire,” James Marsh’s thorough, understated and altogether enthralling documentary. Wisely, Mr. Marsh, who based his film on a book Mr. Petit published in 2002,   never alludes to Sept. 11. That would have been both distracting and redundant, since it’s impossible, while watching a movie so intimate in its attention to the towers, not to be haunted by thoughts of their fate.  But it is also worth recalling that the trade center inspired more love posthumously than while it stood. Mr. Petit was an exception. A zealous, daring wire walker — the French word funambule is a more lyrical, as well as a somewhat more ridiculous-sounding term — he conceived a passion for the structures even before they were built.  As he recalls it (and as Mr. Marsh imagines the scene in one of many witty, unobtrusive re-enactments), the young Mr. Petit was flipping through a magazine at a doctor’s office when he saw an article about plans to construct the two tallest skyscrapers in the world side by side at the bottom of Manhattan. In his mind, and then in a series of sketches and diagrams, he drew a simple line connecting the buildings and imagined himself perched atop it.  What kind of person would think of such a thing? How would he go about accomplishing it? Why? Those are the questions that preoccupy Mr. Marsh, whose earlier films include the semidocumentary “Wisconsin Death Trip” and the fictional feature “The King.”  The first question is answered largely by Mr. Petit’s own testimony. In his 50s, he is elfin and energetic, a beguiling combination of showboat, idealist and con man. And in his early, outlaw years, before the twin towers walk brought him fame and a measure of legitimacy, he combined an exalted sense of artistic mission with a street criminal’s sense of serious mischief.  Accordingly, “Man on Wire” is constructed like a heist movie, in the manner of “Rififi” or the revived “Ocean’s Eleven” franchise. Though Mr. Petit was alone on the cable that August morning, his walk in the sky was the result of a conspiracy of true believers and casual adventurers. In his two previous acts of guerrilla funambulism — at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris and on the Harbor   Bridge in Sydney — he relied on the logistical and moral support of several friends, including his lover, Annie Allix, and his faithful sidekick, Jean-Louis Blondeau.  In interviews, they and some of Mr. Petit’s other confederates — including two American goofballs and Barry Greenhouse, a flamboyant insurance executive who served as the all-important inside man — reconstruct their project, which they referred to at the time as “the coup,” in fascinating detail. There were engineering problems and also challenges that seem to belong to the world of espionage, as well as the inevitable tensions that arise when a group of people pursue a dangerous goal.  Why did they do it? Rather than risking banality by addressing this question head-on, Mr. Marsh allows the answer to be at once self-evident and profoundly mysterious. A work of art is its own explanation, and “Man on Wire” leaves no doubt that Mr. Petit’s coup deserves to be called art. Mr. Blondeau, a sensitive and cerebral foil to the impish Mr. Petit, chokes up when he recalls watching his friend step out over the abyss. “The important thing is that we did it,” he says.  And without making any grandiose claims, this lovely, touching film demonstrates that the World Trade Center sky walk was an important event. The proof is in the emotions — amusement, amazement, awe — evoked by those images of a tiny human figure balancing above a void. Also gratitude. It is easy to imagine that, in contemplating the scale and solidity of those brand-new towers, Mr. Petit saw them at least partly as the vehicle of his own immortality (whether or not he survived the crossing). No one looking up at the New York sky on a hazy morning 34 years ago and seeing a man on a wire could have suspected that the reverse would turn out to be true.  “Man on Wire” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned).  It includes nudity, sexuality and drug references. 

A man walks on a high-wire across the Twin Towers -- and how he does it -- is the grab-you-by-the-lapels premise from which James Marsh's "Man on Wire" erupts onscreen as one of the most wildly entertaining docs of recent years. This docu of daredevil Philippe Petit, who brought together a motley crew to help him realize his dream of crossing from the top of one tower to the other in 1974, is an adventure tale that astonishes in every respect. A double prize-winner at Sundance (jury and audience awards), the pic figures to balance considerable biz in theatrical and vid arenas.
Marsh has thankfully stepped back from his disappointing first narrative film, "The King," and returned to his real metier: non-fiction ("Troubleman," "Wisconsin Death Trip"). Cleverly, he inserts some re-staged material from the beginning moments that feel like the windup to a heist movie, but unlike many docs including freshly staged action, the line between new and archive is fairly invisible.
The "heist" is actually Petit's team tensely prepping to stealthily enter the World Trade Center on Aug. 7, 1974, with doubts held by the crew's French members about some of the seemingly shady Yanks in their circle. Pic is structured in a movie-within-a-movie fashion, with the action of that day hurtling forward in segments, as Petit's background and previous high-wire stunts is told chronologically.
A child who refused to acknowledge physical limits, Petit loved the wire from an early age, and the superb and ample archive footage and photos of his walks across the towers of Notre Dame and the Sydney Bridge towers suggest a dizzying combination of athleticism, poetry, public performance and showbiz that can only be compared with the wild motorcycle stunts of Evel Knievel. Like Knievel, Petit is his own best publicist and raconteur, spinning out thoughts (in his deliciously accented English) with such joie de vivre that had Marsh conceived his film as a single talking-head shot of Petit alone, that would have been enough.
Impressive from an archival standpoint is the electrifying yet pastoral color footage of Petit training for the Twin Tower walk with g.f./partner Annie Allix (who put aside her own dreams to support Petit's), longtime friend Jean-Louis Blondeau and Jean-Francois Heckel. Planning was profoundly important, shown in images of Petit's models of the tower roofs and rehearsals to re-create the effect of high winds whipping the wire.
The group of unlikely characters who assisted in Gotham (including musician and then-pothead David (aka Donald) Foreman), plus the semi-comic suspense and absurd accidents that happened in the Twin Towers -- whose erection is lovingly viewed here without a second's mention of 9/11-- are elements worthy of a Billy Wilder movie. The fact that Petit and his team were able to get their load of equipment and tools to the top floor simply by asking to be taken there by the freight elevator operator is just one sign that the gods must have been in their corner.
Marsh brilliantly matches his images to the hypnotic and propulsive music of English minimalist composer Michael Nyman, including pieces from Nyman's masterpiece, "La traversee de Paris," and his collaborations with Peter Greenaway. It's a sublime choice that lifts "Man on Wire" to rare movie-watching giddiness.
Petit's final walk -- seen here mainly in still photos -- is stunning enough, but the aftermath is unexpectedly emotional and overwhelming as human drama. The immediate effect on Petit of sudden, post-WTC notoriety mixes erotic comedy and personal loss that seems possible to be conveyed by only the best screenwriters.
Though funders Discovery Films and BBC no doubt have TV designs for the film, "Man on Wire" is bigscreen in every way.

A group of foreign nationals slips into the World Trade Center , carrying suitcases filled with thousands of pounds of equipment, including cables, ropes, knives, and a bow and arrow. They sneak up 110 stories, set up shop overnight, and in the early overcast morning, commit a crime that grips the city and astounds its citizens.
If Philippe Petit 's infamous 1974 tightrope walk between the Twin Towers sounds like an episode of 24 , James Marsh 's new documentary Man on Wire , a festival crowd-pleaser and award winner around the globe, makes it look like a '70s heist flick.
Incredible for its brash illegality as well as its derring-do, Petit's high-wire dance a quarter-mile into thin air quickly became a defining piece of Manhattan lore. Now, post-9/11, it offers a nostalgic glimpse into a more innocent time and a retroactive memorial for the towers that are no longer there.
Petit and his co-conspirators all agree that today such a "coup" would be impossible. "The world has changed drastically," he says. "In big cities, entering a secure building with equipment, I think you'd get shot first and asked questions later."
The team's "inside man," Barry Greenhouse , an assistant director of research for the New York State Insurance Department who offered his ID to make fake credentials and his 82nd-floor office for storing equipment, recalls: "There was, like, no security at all. There was a guy who walked the entire 110 floors three times a year, and I joined him. And nobody ever stopped us." After Petit's walk, Greenhouse's bosses scolded him—not for making their offices complicit in a crime, but for not giving them advance warning of the historic walk. "The cops never ever talked to me," adds Greenhouse, whose Dalí-esque mustache figures prominently in Marsh's film.
When he heard of the stunt, World Trade Center president Guy Tozzoli's first thought wasn't of a security breach, but a photo op. "I said: 'Listen, if he doesn't fall off, don't arrest him—this is great publicity,' " Tozzoli remembers telling the Port Authority Police. Because he ultimately didn't fall, Tozzoli adds, "Philippe did me a great favor. From that time on, people embraced the towers more than any other time; it made them very human. And we were on the front page of almost every newspaper in the world."
Indeed, many New Yorkers who witnessed the act remember it—in contrast to the '77 blackout or the Son of Sam  murders—as a welcome diversion from the chaos of the decade.
Matthew Warshaw , a broker for Merrill Lynch  who was 14 years old at the time and has since become friends with Petit, remembers watching the high-wire walk from the roof of his apartment on 21st Street and Second Avenue. "I watched the Twin Towers go up," recalls Warshaw. "At the time, we would go under the towers and feel the immensity of them. And to see a guy have the guts and ability to string a wire between them and walk out there for 45 minutes was way beyond anything I could imagine."
"This thing of Petit's was a massive work of art," recalls David Foreman , a songwriter who stumbled onto the plot and helped bring up the cables on the eve of the stunt. "Bigger than The Gates , in my mind, and certainly more than this waterfall thing. Initially, I thought it would be a tremendous goof, but it was not funny; it was amazing."
To this day, Petit says, people still thank him for offering them "inspiration," and for making the towers appear "beautiful." He adds: "At the time, Nixon  was resigning"—the president actually stepped down later on the very same day of Petit's walk, August 7, 1974—"so it was more than a performance; it was a daring breath of fresh air."
Unlike today's New York Times Building climbers or amateur photographers who get roughed up and arrested by the NYPD, Petit's act was actually welcomed by New York authorities. After an initial violent takedown after he stepped off the wires, the cops asked for his autograph. (Another conspirator, Alan Welner , was taken into police custody, but got off by claiming he was on the roof because he was a Village Voice   photographer.) And although Petit was booked for disorderly conduct and criminal trespassing, his initial punishment was just another high-wire walk for some crippled children. Petit, who admits to having a "giant disrespect for the law," says he ignored this slap on the wrist in favor of a big walk above Central Park 's Belvedere Castle. "I turned the sentence of the court into something illegal as well," he says with a snigger. (He also turned his instant celebrity into instant gratification: Petit got lucky with a buoyant female fan the morning after being released from police custody.)
While largely lighthearted, Petit's walk and Marsh's film take on new meaning post-9/11. Man on Wire  never mentions the events of that day, but the Trade Center's collapse continues to weigh on Petit, as if its destruction was every bit as tragic as the human lives lost that day. "I was shocked," says Petit, remembering the moment he watched the towers fall. "I felt like something alive was pulled out from me."
