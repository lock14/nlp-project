         A spellbinding, intelligent thriller that takes its time to get where it's going but is well worth the trip, "Red Road" is the feature debut of British filmmaker Andrea Arnold, who won an Oscar for her short film "Wasp." Part of the Advance Party Concept, a new project from some of the folks who brought us the minimalist Dogma 95, the film is a gritty tour of Glasgow's projects via the all-seeing City Eye surveillance system.
 
 In an Orwellian scheme of closed-circuit television cameras throughout the city, images are beamed to a control center filled with video monitors observed by operators who alert the police to anything that seems amiss. Jackie, the film's protagonist, works as an operator, watching the large bank of monitors, alternately bemused and intrigued by the mundane transactions that appear.
 


         






   It's an act of sanctioned voyeurism, and occasionally she witnesses a crime or gets an unexpurgated view of people having sex. From her remote perch she sees the gamut of life and death interactions. One day, she is startled to recognize a man to whom she has some dark connection. Arnold slowly reveals just enough information about Jackie to keep us riveted. In expertly parsing out the exposition she simultaneously builds an intriguing character while laying the groundwork for a gripping yarn of suspense.
 
 Jackie is played with bravura simplicity by Katie Dickie, a Scottish TV actor making her film debut. Dickie bears a passing resemblance to a young Helen Mirren and shares her ability to shape a performance through her eyes.
 
 We learn gradually that Jackie bears the weight of intense sorrow. Her life consists of trips between her sparse home and work, punctuated by a bi-weekly tryst with a married man in his security van.
 
 Then she spots Clyde Henderson (intensely played by Tony Curran) on her video monitor. Carefully, she verifies his identity and tracks him down to Red Road, where he lives in blighted public housing. Her rudderless life suddenly takes on meaning as she infiltrates the lives of Clyde and his flatmates (Martin Compston and Natalie Press).
 
 Arnold reels us in as she pieces together the dots that connect Jackie to Clyde and grudgingly divulges her intentions toward him. There's a smoldering current of sex and violence running throughout "Red Road," and it's an indication of Arnold's skill as a filmmaker that we experience this even as Jackie is submerged in a world of melancholy.
 
 The Advance Party Concept plans two more films with different writers and directors using the same four primary characters, played by the same actors. Aside from a starting point in Scotland and basic character traits, the writers may take the scripts in any direction. It's an unusual idea, and it will be interesting to see how it plays out, but Arnold has certainly set the bar high for the other filmmakers.
 
 The film will screen with English subtitles to help with the, at times, heavy Scottish accents.

 “Red Road,” the arresting first feature by Andrea Arnold (who won  a best-short-film Oscar for “Wasp”) takes place in a world where the daily activities of citizens are subject to constant surveillance. That is, it takes place in an ordinary city — Glasgow, as it happens — at the present time. The dire Orwellian warning that Big Brother is watching has evolved from a grim fantasy of totalitarianism into a banal fact of life, in democratic as well as in authoritarian societies. The security cameras fastened on lampposts and the sides of buildings, after all, are put there with our safety in mind, and we have learned to view them with more reassurance than alarm when we notice them at all.  It is fitting, then, that Ms. Arnold’s interest in the phenomenon of surveillance is less political than psychological. At the center of her film is Jackie (Kate Dickie), who works in a police observation center called City Eye where she sits in front of a wall of video monitors, punching a keyboard and toggling a joystick to pan and zoom across a disjointed panorama of urban life. Jackie is like a moviegoer and, given her ability to edit and refine the images she collects, like a filmmaker as well. Right from the start, then, the director, the heroine and the audience are all implicated in a queasy, curious game of intimate spying.  Jackie’s voyeuristic tendencies at first seem fairly benign, and the familiarity she feels with other  Glaswegians looks more like fellow-feeling than prurience. She smiles in sympathy at a man walking his ailing bulldog, and in amusement at an office cleaner dancing with her headphones on. But Jackie is also lonely, and clearly suffering. The anonymous people she watches are all the human contact she can stand, apart from the occasional bout of perfunctory sex with a co-worker and an awkward encounter with her former in-laws.  Ms. Arnold allows the details of Jackie’s situation to emerge gradually and obliquely, as much through gesture and implication as through dialogue. The specifics of her grief — she is mourning both a husband and a child — are less important than the mood. Ms. Dickie, tall and stoop-shouldered, with an angular face that refuses to acknowledge its own beauty, never overdoes the character’s numb sadness. The depth of it is not evident until, one evening at work, one of the cameras picks up the face of a man named Clyde (Tony Curran) who is obviously (though for a long time enigmatically) connected with the destruction of Jackie’s family.  He is a burly, ginger-haired ex-convict — thuggish but not entirely without decency or charm — who lives in a high-rise housing project the address of which gives the movie its title. He serves as a kind of surrogate big brother for an excitable young man named Stevie (Martin Compston) and his girlfriend, April (Natalie Press). As Jackie begins to stalk Clyde, using the resources of her job to keep track of his comings and goings, she enters a murky ethical zone, and the movie treads into the boggy terrain of melodrama.  A credit at the end notes that Ms. Arnold worked on the film at the Sundance Institute, and as its plot accelerates, some Sundance hallmarks — in particular a familiar dialectic of abjection and redemption — become visible. But if the story falters toward the end, Ms. Arnold’s filmmaking never does. Her style of shooting and editing is like a more artful, more expressive adaptation of the fuzzy, haphazard movements of the surveillance cameras. Like Jackie, she restlessly reframes and adjusts her images, nudging them to disclose latent or hidden meanings. Her deft juxtaposition of sound and silence — the City Eye cameras have no accompanying ears — adds to the atmosphere of paranoia and dislocation.  And Ms. Arnold’s control is matched by Ms. Dickie’s. A well-regarded British television actress making her first appearance in a feature, she is a haunted, haunting presence, keeping an almost terrifying intensity hidden just beneath her drab exterior. As Jackie moves closer to Clyde, crashing one of his parties, hanging out at his local pub, it is hard to tell what, if anything, she has planned. Is she after revenge? Reconciliation? Or is she even aware of what she wants, or what she’s doing? Ms. Dickie’s achievement, and Ms. Arnold’s, is to hold all of these possibilities in suspension, so that you feel you are watching someone approaching an impossible, dangerous choice.  It feels almost inappropriate to witness such agony at such close range, but it is also a form of poetic justice, given Jackie’s profession and her abuse of it. Beyond that, the queasy mixture of sympathy and curiosity that “Red Road” evokes is evidence of a talented, risk-taking filmmaker discovering her power.
Sensual, dark in every sense, but a touch derivative, "Red Road" reps an impressive feature debut for Brit writer-helmer Andrea Arnold, an Oscar-winner for her knockout short "Wasp." Cannes contender about a Glaswegian surveillance camera operator (Kate Dickie) seeking out an ex-jailbird (Tony Curran) for mysterious reasons builds up an atmospheric miasma of suspense, then fumbles the last act with an overwrought reveal. Given its unflinching take on femme sexuality and expressionist visuals, comparisons with work by Jane Campion ("In the Cut") and Lynne Ramsay (Morvern Callar") seem inevitable, but "Road" looks headed down specialist release path, albeit with numerous fest detours.
Pic is first production out of the gate for the Advance Party concept, a project that aims to make a series of films by different directors, all set in Scotland, and all based around the same core group of characters developed by Lone Scherfig ("Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself") and Anders Thomas Jensen ("Brothers"), regular employees for Danish co-producer Zentropa.
Although Arnold gets sole writing credit for "Road," Danish influence is palpable in plot's muted but still melodramatic climax which hinges on a psychological twist that slightly strains credibility.
Jackie (strong-featured legit thesp Dickie, making her feature film debut) is employed by a private security firm to monitor a swathe of CCTV cameras trained on a rough neighborhood in North Glasgow. She seems to live quietly, her only social life consisting of fortnightly jaunts with a married colleague for loveless (and apparently orgasmless, on her part) shags in his car. A widow, Jackie lost her husband and child in circumstances only specified at the end.
Jackie appears to have an obsessive interest in Clyde (Curran, soon to be seen in "Miami Vice"), an ex-con who she spots on her cameras. Clyde, his friend Stevie (Martin Compston from "Sweet Sixteen") and Stevie's g.f. April (Natalie Press, "My Summer of Love"), all live in an apartment many stories up in a decrepit high-rise on the Red Road housing estate, where the lifts look as if they were decorated by Jean-Michel Basquiat.
Jackie starts stalking Clyde around the estate and later contrives to run into him "accidentally" at a pub, where Stevie has a fight with an older man (laying foundations, no doubt, for a plot in a future Advance Party production). Clyde and Jackie end up back at his apartment for some NC-17 sex, swiftly followed by surprising behavior from Jackie that makes it clear revenge has been her motive all along.
Auds and crix are likely to debate the believability of her subsequent actions, which will strike some as highly implausible, even given Jackie's revealed reasons. End result leaves pic feeling like a somewhat attenuated short with the de rigueur sting-in-the-tail payoff. ��
Nevertheless, helmer Arnold delivers on the promise of her short "Wasp," which like "Red Road" used a seedy pub as a key location, to have an acute eye and ear for the textures and voices of working-class Brit culture.
There are plenty of poetic touches rich in savor, such as a scene where Stevie opens a window in the apartment so that Jackie and April can feel the powerful onrush of wind tens of stories up.
Meanwhile, there's a balm of warmth in the treatment of minor characters, such as Jackie's quietly bereaved father-in-law Alfred (Andrew Armour), endlessly fussing over her neglected garden, or a man (actor unknown) with an ailing dog she smiles down on through her spy cameras like a benevolent, all-seeing deity.
Treatment of femme sexuality is complex and unflinching, calling to mind not just the aforementioned Campion and Ramsay, but also the portrait of neurotic promiscuity in Carine Adler's "Under the Skin" and to some extent Gallic helmers like Claire Denis and Catherine Breillat. Although the sex scene is hot and heavy, cutaways to the reflection of a lava lamp in a night-darkened window add a cooling touch.
Lensing, on high-definition cameras using colored gels and short focal lengths, by Robbie Ryan is frequently ravishing.
Perfs, especially from lead Dickie whose face expresses much and mouth says little, richly enhance pic's overall effect. Curran, feral, sexy and menacing all at once, is also strong, while Compston and Press, both bigger stars at this point, do good work with relatively small parts.
Rest of tech package is solid, although use of ominous growls on soundtrack, to sparse to qualify as music, are slightly thumping as clues to character's moods and feelings.

Like all voyeurs, Jackie (Kate Dickie ), a gaunt young woman surrounded by the chilly fog of the horribly lonely, lacks a life to call her own outside of her job manning a police closed-circuit television camera in Glasgow 's dead-end inner city. At once a helper and a seemingly detached observer, she lives through the small dramas that unfold on her screens. Like her protagonist, writer-director Andrea Arnold  plays the source of Jackie's own grief close to her chest, focusing on her growing obsession with a shifty- looking man (Tony Curran ) whom she tracks through his sordid days and nights in a graffiti-scarred housing project. No one does poetic British with more remorseless hyper-realism than the Scots, and Arnold, who amassed a raft of reputable awards for her 2003 short film Wasp , directs with a precociously sure touch and a raw taste for graphic sexuality rare in a woman helmer. It shocks, yet feels organic to the paranoid, loveless milieu portrayed in Red Road . As cat stalks mouse and vice versa, it becomes less and less clear whose heart is in greater need of softening. If the movie is marred by pat uplift at the end, it's worth bearing in mind that this is not just a feature debut but the first in a Lars von Trier inspired Dogme trilogy in which three directors embellish on the same cast of pre-assigned characters. The measure of Red Road  is that it leaves us hungry for what comes next.
