         "Shock to the System" is a gay-detective yarn that plays it too straight. Donald Strachey (Chad Allen), who we're frequently reminded is the most famous gay private eye in Albany, is hired by a nervous young man who promptly turns up dead. The detective's investigation leads him to an organization that claims to "rehabilitate" homosexuals, where he meets a host of potential suspects.
 
  "Shock" is the second movie to feature Allen as the detective from Richard Stevenson's books, with several more films planned. With its shadowy cinematography and '40s-style opening and closing music and credits, it's clear the filmmakers (led by director Ron "Queer As Folk" Oliver) are aiming for a gay noir. Unfortunately, what they settle for is less Mickey Spillane than movie of the week. The lack of grittiness in this would-be hard-boiled thriller is underscored by the preternaturally clean streets of "Albany," which look suspiciously safe and Canadian.
 


         






    The movie's greatest obstacle, however, is its own earnestness. Where film noir is often punch-drunk with a jab of snappy patter and a left hook of world-weary cynicism, "Shock" tries to clinch with understanding. The murky broth of gay cures should be an excellent starter for a film (despite the stumbles of "But I'm a Cheerleader"), but this one is so grimly determined to be even-handed that it never generates tension. To its credit, its characters have unusual depth for the genre, and the actors give it the old college try. However, there aren't enough novelty, wit or sufficient shocks to the system to make this film memorable. Its strangest bedfellows turn out to be the filmmakers' noir aspirations ... and their good intentions.

 With his 1981 novel “Death Trick,” under the pseudonym Richard Stevenson, the writer Richard Lipez began a series of mysteries featuring Donald Strachey, a gay private investigator on the mean streets of New York — Albany, to be precise. Using the detective mode to reflect on gay themes, and vise versa, the books were sexy, playful and unafraid of politics, while always mindful of their genre mandate.  “Shock to the System” is the second Donald Strachey mystery to be adapted into a movie for the gay cable channel Here! Making allowances for the scale and tone of a low-budget television project, this is a sly, refreshingly grown-up gay entertainment, though rather less satisfying as a thriller. It’s enough to make one curious to see the first (“Third Man Out”) and hope they get around to adapting the other five. I, for one, would see any movie with a name as marvelous as “On the Other Hand, Death.”  Sweetly compelling as Strachey, Chad Allen embodies and subverts the classic butch detective. The plot involves Strachey going undercover at a gay conversion therapy organization to investigate the suspicious suicide of a client. His snooping leads through the predictable mystery movie twists, but also to a surprisingly nuanced take on the way gay conversion therapy exploits universal anxieties about who we are and wish we could be.  Morgan Fairchild turns in a freakish cameo amid a supporting cast nicely filled out by Sebastian Spence as Strachey’s politico boyfriend, Nelson Wong as his eager new office manager, Michael Woods as the conversion therapy guru and a handful of naked football players.  “Shock to the System” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Some hard-boiled language, some gay hanky panky and a steamy shower scene.

"Shock to the System" is a perfectly respectable second entry in the saga of gay private eye Donald Strachey (based on author Richard Stevenson's books), which began with 2005's "Third Man Out." Made with television in mind but receiving a modest August theatrical run, Canuck helmer Ron Oliver's film noir-lite casts the founder of a center designed to turn gays and lesbians straight as the gumshoe's nemesis. Enough action, a tiny pinch of sex and some campy moments from Morgan Fairchild should the draw target aud in advance of a vid rendezvous.
Strachey (Chad Allen) finds his client (Jared Keeso's Paul Hale) dead -- supposedly by his own hand -- before he can tell the p.i. whom he's looking for. Not buying the suicide theory, Strachey sniffs a trail that leads from Hale's in-denial mom (Fairchild), who fiercely blurts out "my son wasn't gay!") to Dr. Cornell (Michael Woods), a shady type who runs a gay "reparative therapy" center.
Husband Timmy (Sebastian Spence) enjoys helping Strachey piece together the clues, but on the street, the p.i. must go undercover to penetrate Cornell's inner sanctum and learn the truth about Paul's mysterious demise. A sidebar story involving ex-Army vet Strachey's first love during the Gulf War is designed to add texture and poke a dig at "don't-ask-don't-tell," but it's simply an awkward appendix to this slight tale.
All of the genre's required ingredients are here -- from the slight comic relief with the new secretary in Strachey's office to multiple suspects and Macguffins -- to suggest that Oliver and screenwriter Ron McGee have affection for the tradition of Dashiell Hammett, Raymond Chandler and "The Thin Man." The twist of casting all of this within a gay prism seems clever enough, yet the pic can't help appearing like a dress-up version of noir.
Impression is reinforced with surface thesping (except from Allen, who disdains the tough guy facade), and design and music contributions, all of which seem scaled to the small screen.

After this cutesy whodunit adapted from Richard Stevenson 's long-running mystery series, the late Mickey Spillane  must be spinning in his crypt. Not because it features a gay private eyelet alone one who makes his first big appearance bobbing up from his husband's lapbut because it packs all the pulpy authenticity of rotgut served from a teapot. In his second outing (after last year's Third Man Out ) as Stevenson's Albany - based shamus Donald Strachey , Chad Allen  again flexes the hard-boiled chops he honed on Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman  . Here, the suave gumshoe with the Bloomsbury  namesake and the absurdly vanilla spouse (Sebastian Spence ) goes undercover to check out a shady conversion-therapy clinic, dodging bullets, hit-and-run attempts, and the hungry looks of a recovering boy toy (Shawn Roberts ) whose conversion ain't exactly taking. Tentatively mixing homage, genre subversion, and quippy Remington Steele style Detective Lite, director Ron Oliver  applies a thin veneer of straight-to-cable pseudo-gloss without finding a workable tone, and the cast lacks the charisma and chemistry to make the genre and gender-bending register as more than novelty: In this crew, as a sinister dowager, '80s prime-time soap queen Morgan Fairchild  stands out like Isabelle Huppert .
