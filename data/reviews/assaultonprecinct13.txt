The new bullet-riddled remake of ''Assault on Precinct 13" is disappointing for a number of reasons. For one thing, it's silly. For another, it's not always silly enough to be diverting. But most underwhelming is the language. Everything from the profanity to the actual conversations sounds forced, as though it were all being directed by someone who just hasn't mastered the rhythmic art of American cursing.
Closer inspection reveals that the movie's ringmaster is Jean-Franois Richet, a French director making his Hollywood debut. While the violence hits many of its grisly and gritty marks, the talking is frequently inane. One of my favorites is when the testy lady gang-banger (Aisha Hinds) tells her cellmate (John Leguizamo), ''This ain't no blackout, junkie. There's something suspect going on. And I wanna know what the funk it is!" I'm not sure that would fly even in a Michael Bay production.
These two, along with a con artist (Jeffrey ''Ja Rule" Atkins) and a murderous criminal mastermind, Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), were being taken to a high-security prison. A huge snowstorm kicks up, however, and they're diverted to a decrepit, no-security Detroit police station that's about to be shut down. The sergeant on duty, Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), takes them in but is bummed because Bishop is a cop killer; plus, it's New Year's Eve, and all he, the station secretary (Drea de Matteo), and the crusty, soon-to-retire veteran (Brian Dennehy) wanted to do was party.
Things go further south for Roenick and company after they discover that just outside their isolated building is a Richard Price-load of crooked cops, led by Gabriel Byrne, who want to silence Bishop before he rats them out. Hence the cut phone lines, titular assault, and ensuing melee. Along the way, other characters pop in and out of the station, folks like Roenick's high-strung shrink (Maria Bello), who was on her way to a party until her car breaks down.
The movie is desperate for us to think something is heating up between doctor and patient. But it would not be wrong to watch Hawke gaze at Bello and not get a flashback of his doing the same thing to Julie Delpy in ''Before Sunset." But his real acting foil is Fishburne, who brings out of Hawke a looser, less revelatory rendition of his rookie cop in ''Training Day."
Fishburne goes in the opposite direction of Denzel Washington, who in that movie saw fit to eat every ounce of scenery. Fishburne, dressed in a purple suit more appropriate on ex-pro footballer Michael Irvin or the Joker, simmers all his portentous lines. This dude is so heavy that Leguizamo's sweaty junkie calls him ''the black Rasputin." But with his infinite wisdom, unflappable demeanor, and awesome action-movie skills, he actually seems to have dropped by from the Matrix.
It's hard to come up with a reassuring explanation for the existence of this remake, which James DeMonaco has grossly overwritten. John Carpenter's 1976 original was close to perfect, pitting, among others, a mad dad against the vicious LA street gang that killed his little girl. Carpenter masterfully mined the visceral kick from pulp fiction, while tapping into the decade's preoccupation with the personal revenge fantasy. Its ruthlessness is still jarring.
What's most jarring about this ''Assault" is having to watch Dennehy try to find a more creative place to use the ''f" word than de Matteo and Ja Rule. When it's in motion, the remake is occasionally a sturdy piece of genre work, but it's hard to believe for a minute, with the villainous cops coming off as extraneously chatty. Carpenter's original was all action and little talk. No one in this movie knows when to shut up and shoot.


         It's a wintry night in Detroit on New Year's Eve as the tense and exciting "Assault on Precinct 13" opens. A shabby facility on the edge of downtown, Precinct 13 is scheduled for imminent permanent closure. As midnight draws near, only three people remain inside: a young sergeant, Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), haunted by the death of his partner in a misfired undercover drug sting; Iris (Drea de Matteo), the precinct's coolly sexy secretary; and a veteran cop, Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy), about to announce his retirement.
 
  Their quiet evening and plans for a modest celebration are abruptly interrupted when a major local crime lord, Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), is unexpectedly arrested in a shootout with a policeman and Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne), head of the department's Organized Crime and Racketeering Squad, has been sent to Precinct 13 along with three prisoners: highly articulate but paranoid junkie Beck (John Leguizamo, ever distinctive and commanding), counterfeiter Smiley (Jeffrey "Ja Rule" Atkins) and gang member Anna (Aisha Hinds).
 


         






    Suddenly, the dilapidated Precinct 13, located in a fairly isolated area, now deserted on a snowy New Year's Eve, is under attack. The immediate assumption is that Bishop's gang is trying to break him out. But "Assault on Precinct 13," a savvy and extensive reworking of John Carpenter's 1976 cult classic of the same name — which in turn was inspired by Howard Hawks' 1959 "Rio Bravo" — is full of surprises. It is also full of suspense and unexpected twists that are all the more impressive for emerging within the confined circumstances of a classic siege movie. (Shades of "Fort Apache" and "Fort Apache, the Bronx.")
 
  With cellphones blocked and phone lines cut, those trapped inside are swiftly placed in extreme danger, outnumbered by a well-coordinated, heavily armed attack team. Director Jean-François Ríchet and writer James DeMonaco make the most of a strong premise to create a timeless study of character under extreme pressure.
 
  Roenick is smart, skilled and dedicated, but his department psychologist (Maria Bello), who has dropped by to check in on him, believes he has been eluding responsibility since the death of his partner, for which he feels responsible. And he has been numbing his pain by popping pills and sneaking swigs from a liquor bottle in his desk drawer. But as the hours wear on, Bello's Alex proves not to be nearly as self-confident as her facade suggests. With his large frame and dead-eyed laser gaze, Bishop is automatically a formidable presence but also possesses a first-rate mind sharpened by street smarts. One of Roenick's key challenges is to hold in check O'Shea, who expresses a deep hatred of Bishop as a cop killer. The strung-out Beck is in turn a lethally loose cannon.
 
  A young Frenchman in his American directing debut and best known for "De l'Amour," Ríchet displays a terrific sense of mood and atmosphere, and his terse, succinct pacing and involving characters deftly deflect any questions of plausibility. He and DeMonaco started out with strong material and made the most of it. Indeed, DeMonaco has written a raft of compelling and complex characters that the film's splendid ensemble cast brings to life with panache. The interplay between the characters is consistently revealing, and Hawke and Fishburne, with their sharply contrasting personalities and physical presences, anchor the escalating action and suspense. "Assault on Precinct 13" is smart, satisfying action entertainment that is also a perceptive work of considerable artistry.

Watching Assault on Precinct 13 , the volatile yet fairly lunkheaded remake of John Carpenter's so-primitive-it's-hip 1976 B movie, you may develop a fresh appreciation for how the crackling flow of communications technology  cell phones and PCs, the nifty interconnectivity of the whole wired (and wireless) world  is now intrinsic to the flow of movies themselves. I grew highly attuned to that flow only because Assault on Precinct 13  so sorely, and implausibly, lacks it.
In Detroit on New Year's Eve, as snow blankets the night in gushy thick layers, a bus carrying a group of prisoners is forced by the blizzard to lay over at a crumbly police station that's on the verge of being shuttered. Just a few cops are on duty, notably Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), an injured undercover officer whose knee wound has turned him into a self-medicating desk jockey. As the prisoners are placed in the precinct's holding cell, it appears to be a routine night. That is, until the station comes under attack by a squad of rogue cops in heavy combat gear who are out to kill Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), a natty gang kingpin who was part of the bus convoy, and to knock off everyone else in the building for good measure. There is much frantic barricading of doors and windows, much raucous machine-gun fire and shattered glass. Only Jake, the cop with a criminal's cunning, can save the night by getting his cohorts and his prisoners to fight together.
The original Assault , which is fondly remembered for its great bare-bones synth score (Dun dun-dun DUH duhhhh! Dun dun-dun DUH duhhhh!), was basically Rio Bravo crossed with Night of the Living Dead . In Carpenter's film, the precinct's phone lines get shut down 12 hours ahead of schedule, and that  in the '70s, at least  was enough to cut the place off from the outside world. Jean-François Ríchet, the director of the new Assault , is working from a script, by James DeMonaco, that creates a handful of zingy one-note lowlifes but that hasn't updated the isolated-precinct premise in a timely or thoughtful way. In this version, no one is able to muster a cellphone signal, but all I could think was, Isn't there a computer in the house? With e-mail? Or at least a fax machine? Wouldn't there be some way on God's digital earth to signal for help?
The clatter of machine guns turns the area into a deafening war zone (in Carpenter's film, the L.A. youth-gang shooters used silencers, then a relatively novel device for movie assassins), yet we're supposed to think that because the building lies on the outskirts of downtown Detroit, it's as remote as a fort in Siberia. There will, I suppose, be those who embrace the borderline ludicrousness of Assault on Precinct 13  as an aspect of its chintzy cool, but even a B movie needs to be rooted in a certain credibility  a nexus of circumstance, hardware, and logistics that forces, at every moment, one course of action over another. Assault on Precinct 13 , for all its ballistic zam-pow, lacks the entertaining tension of a movie like The Negotiator  (also written by DeMonaco) because it's hard to believe a minute of it.
Yet parts of the picture are fun anyway. Hawke, grinning like a madman, has a hopped-up addict's craziness in the opening scenes, when he's working the drug deal that gets him wounded. He's far more convincing as a guy who knows his way around a gun than he was in Training Day , though his initial pretending-to-be-high intensity is so arresting that I missed it in the rest of the film. Fishburne, conjuring the suave shell of his Matrix  persona, could do these sorts of granite-faced ominous stares in his sleep (and probably does), though he's great at it. He looks at Beck (John Leguizamo), the matted-hair skank of a junkie in the next cell, as if he were a gnat he'd like to crush  and given Leguizamo's penchant for mush-mouthed overacting, you may share the sentiment. The one ingeniously staged scene is a seven-person Mexican standoff sparked when Jasper (Brian Dennehy), the Lovable Old Irish Cop, squares off with Jake over whether the crooks should be given guns.
After that, the film turns basic, to put it mildly. A few more of the characters get knocked off than you were expecting, and more brutally, too. Yet the dramatic pivot, which is Jake's refusal to hand Marion over to his enemies, would have had more punch if it sprung from a twinge of moral compulsion  that is, if Jake's own survival didn't depend on it from the outset. That's what Carpenter's Assault  had: an allegiance between cop and criminal as stubborn as it was corny. Thirty years later, the romanticization of the underworld is now all too automatic. In the new Assault , you never feel as if those who indulge in it have their honor to lose.

he new "Assault on Precinct 13," which stars Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne, is a remake of the old "Assault on Precinct 13," directed by John Carpenter in 1976, two years before he made "Halloween." It should be noted that the old "Precinct 13," a scruffy and unshowily artful exercise in low-budget mayhem, was not altogether new at the time. Its premise -  a motley assortment of cops and crooks holding off a brutal, endless siege  in a lonely police station  - owed a lot to George A. Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" (1968) and also to Howard Hawks's "Rio Bravo" (1959). This is a perfectly respectable pedigree, and I do not mean to suggest that you should avoid the new "Assault on Precinct 13," directed by Jean-Fran�ois Richet from a screenplay by James DeMonaco, because it's a remake. There are plenty of other reasons. The main one is that the movie cruelly and pointlessly squanders the talents and efforts of its cast as it pushes them through a master class in overacting under duress, rewarding the ones who perform best by killing them off first. In place of Mr. Carpenter's nasty, efficient B-picture style, Mr. Richet, after a swift, mean, promising start, lurches from bursts of gunfire to stretches of tiresome exposition. His idea of cinematic suavity is a bullet to the head followed by a shot of blood seeping into the snow. The alarmingly scrawny Mr. Hawke, who looks as if his next project should be a public service announcement   on the hazards of the Atkins diet, plays Sgt. Jake Roenick, a Detroit policeman still traumatized by an undercover operation that went terribly wrong some months earlier. Wounded and stressed out, he does desk duty in a rundown police station in a heavily forested, apparently unpopulated section of Detroit, popping pills and stealing nips from a bottle of booze he keeps in his desk. It's New Year's Eve, and the sergeant and his remaining staff -  including a crusty old-timer (Brian Dennehy) and a sexpot receptionist (Drea de Matteo)  - are marking the last hours before the precinct is shut down for good. Unfortunately for them, a bus carrying a handful of prisoners from someplace to someplace else is forced by a ferocious blizzard to make an unscheduled stop at  Precinct 13. One of the passengers is Marion Bishop, a velvet-voiced crime lord played by Mr. Fishburne, who may wish to have a chat with Mr. Hawke about the pros and cons of carbohydrates. The subject of diet never comes up, though, since Bishop's presence attracts a platoon of heavily armed assailants, equipped with grenade launchers, night-vision gear and, for the climactic set piece, a helicopter. Their leader is a weary-looking Gabriel Byrne, and their mission is to terminate Bishop and anyone in his immediate vicinity. Outmanned and outgunned, the mutually mistrustful good guys and bad guys inside the station must hold off the invaders. This takes most of the night, and it feels as if it takes most of the new year. Apart from Roenick and Bishop  - who are, you know, complex - each of the characters defending the precinct is allowed a single defining trait. John Leguizamo is a fast-talking, paranoid drug addict; Maria Bello is a high-strung police-department psychiatrist (on hand to treat Roenick's psychic wounds), whose response to danger is to recite multiplication tables. Aisha Hinds and the rap star Ja Rule play expendable African-American criminals, while Dorian Harewood fulfills the same function on the other side of the law. The main thing this "Assault" lacks is a point. Mr. Carpenter's film, like other action and horror movies of the 1970's, still resonates with the political paranoia and social unease of the era.  Mr. Carpenter's cynical refusal to distinguish clearly between good guys and bad guys feels freshly unsettling, while Mr. Richet's "modernization" looks  like something we've seen a hundred times before. "Assault on Precinct 13" is rated R. It has abundant, graphic violence and a lot of swearing.

Appropriately for the remake of a '70s cult-fave action-thriller, "Assault on Precinct 13" comes off as a purposefully retro slam-bang melodrama with an old-school approach to kicking ass, drawing blood and taking lives. In an era when similar genre pics increasingly resemble videogames, musicvideos or glossy commercials, the blunt, brawny simplicity of helmer Jean-Francois Richet's storytelling style seems positively novel, and might inspire the begrudging respect of crix while engaging target urban audiences. Expect above average B.O. and long-term ancillary visibility.
New "Assault on Precinct 13" is an updated retread of the well-regarded and influential 1976 low-budgeter directed, written and scored by pre-"Halloween" John Carpenter. Original recycled plot elements from "Rio Bravo" (and, obliquely, other Howard Hawks classics) and stylistic tropes from "Night of the Living Dead" in a hard-charging drama about cops and convicts forced to join forces inside a shuttered police station while besieged by a bloodthirsty street gang.
Scripter James DeMonaco retains much of the original premise, but recasts the invading hordes as crooked cops bent on silencing a notorious gangster who might testify against them.
Jittery prologue introduces Detroit police sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) during an undercover drug-dealing sting that climaxes with fatal consequences for his two partners. Entire sequence is a self-conscious collage of jump cuts, desaturated colors and hand-held lensing, leading auds to expect the show-offy worst.
But Richet, a French-born auteur making his Yank directing debut, quickly shifts gears when narrative jumps ahead eight months to reintroduce Roenick as a guilt-wracked wreck who swills booze and pops pain pills while marking time at a desk job.
New Year's Eve finds Roenick on duty with vet cop Jasper "Old School" O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) and cheerfully trampy secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo) at Precinct 13, a gone-to-seed police station scheduled to close the following morning. After enduring yet another session with psychiatrist Alex Sabian (Maria Bello), Roenick settles in for a long, uneventful night.
Thanks to a raging snowstorm, however, a police bus transporting prisoners must stop at Precinct 13. Roenick reluctantly agrees to temporarily incarcerate junkie Beck (John Leguizamo), counterfeit merchandise dealer Smiley (rapper-actor Jeffrey "Ja Rule" Atkins), alleged gang-banger Anna (Aisha Hinds), and, most important, Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), a taciturn gangster who recently killed a treacherous business partner.
Unfortunately, that business partner was an undercover cop, and his partners, led by the implacable Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne), are heavily armed and determined to invade Precinct 13 and extinguish Bishop.
Outnumbered and outgunned, Roenick is forced to arm the prisoners while leading a desperate defense with no electricity and dwindling resources.
Much like Carpenter's original, Richet's remake takes a good half-hour to establish the particulars of its high-concept premise. Nothing in the new "Assault," however, is nearly as shocking as Carpenter's near-legendary scene in which he blithely broke a cardinal rule of genre -- Thou Shalt Not Actually Kill an Endangered Child. But Richet does fine job of building suspense and establishing characters during the early going, laying the groundwork for the protracted siege that grips the audience for the remainder of pic's running time.
Richet and DeMonaco make relatively few adjustments to modernize the scenario -- a throwaway line "explains" why folks inside the police station can't use cell phones or police radios to summon help -- and remain faithful to material's B-movie roots by springing surprises while doling out death sentences to key characters.
Performances are sturdy and straightforward across the board. Fishburne and Byrne bring effortless authority to their roles, while Hawke hits the right notes as he charts various steps -- mocking humor, pained guilt, fearful indecision, steely resolve -- in Roenick's character arc. Among supporting players, de Matteo stands out as a brassy slattern with a weakness for bad boys but impressive inner strength.
Pic benefits greatly from helmer's no-frills staging and cutting of action set pieces: Assaults and interactions are all the more effective because spatial relationships are cleanly defined. Here and elsewhere, lenser Robert Gantz and editor Bill Pankow make invaluable contributions. Near-continuous snowfall in exterior shots also enhances overall mood of anxious dread.
This meat-and-potatoes dish of moviemaking is sufficiently tasty to satisfy auds hungry for old-fashioned rock-the-house action.

A remake of a stellar '70s recombinant that has already served as the basis for a Tarantino script, Jean-François Richet 's Assault on Precinct 13  is a surprisingly credible action flickeven with Ethan Hawke  in the role of a neurotic hipster police sergeant.
The original Assault on Precinct 13  (1976) established its writer-director, John Carpenter , as a shrewd genre artist, two years before Halloween  made him a rich and famous one. Basically, Carpenter took the besieged jailhouse of Howard Hawks 's 1959 John Wayne western Rio Bravo  and, in transposing it to deepest Watts, gave the bad-guy attack the implacable quality of the original Night of the Living Dead . (Decades later, From Dusk Till Dawn  would put a similar zombie story in a western landscape.) The new Assault  reurbanizes the setting to Detroit; it adds a crippling snowstorm, and as the force-of-evil attack mob enlists . . . well, you'll see (or not).
Carpenter's Assault  was pure thrill machine and, for the time, an astonishingly violent movie. The big shock of having an eight-year-old girl shot while enjoying an ice cream cone is mercifully not repeated in Richet's remake. Nor does Richet share Carpenter's mordant humor and taste for lovingly choreographed mayhem. Too much relationship-establishing blather slows down the actionat times the shifting alliances and staggered casualties within the beleaguered station house suggest an episode of Survivor  with everyone armed. But the situational mechanism still works; save for a self-regarding tendency to stop the show to dwell on the rivulets of cosmetic blood coursing from the many casualties produced by continual shooting at very close quarters (even in a crowded church), the new Assault  is pretty darn snappy.
In Rio Bravo  terms, to return to the source, Hawke is both Dean Martin  and John Wayne . Maria Bello  brightens the night as an improbably beautiful police psychologist who goes to work in a skimpy disco dress. John Leguizamo  plays a gabby class-conscious junkie whose constant babble is amusingly bounced off Laurence Fishburne 's gangster kingpin's Morpheus cool. In fact, Assault on Precinct 13  inadvertently suggests The Matrix  when, for reasons never explained, it sets its final reckoning in a foggy wood somewhere in the middle of derelict Detroit.
