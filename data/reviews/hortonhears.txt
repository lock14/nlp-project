It would be pretty hard to muck up this Dr. Seuss story and its kid-friendly parable about the rights of all beings, no matter their size or shape, to the basic freedoms of life and liberty. It's perfect for the little ones, who might feel pushed around by siblings, bullies, and various elders and are sure to identify with all the wee beings whose innate desires are crushed by those larger (and, therefore, more powerful) than they. "A person's a person, no matter how small," retorts Horton the animated elephant (voiced by Carrey) when he's mocked by his jungle cohorts for his protection of the entire town of Whoville, a tiny speck of a world that resides on the head of a single stalk of clover. Horton becomes the laughing stock of the jungle for claiming to hear little voices that no one else hears and for believing there is microscopic life that we can't see. No less an object of ridicule is the Mayor of Who-ville (voiced by Carell), whom the Whos call a boob for his complicity with the unseen Horton to save their community. For my money, I've never seen anything much wrong with the animated Chuck Jones version of this Seuss tale, made for TV in 1970. But everything needs an update, I suppose, and this new animated feature does the job nicely, staying true to the playfulness of the Seussian rhymes and messages while ably adding in new bits of business to expand Seuss' verse to feature length. Carrey's general tendency toward comic mania is gently toned down, allowing the rubbery elephant to seem more a lovable goofball than a frenzied nut job. Carell's readings as the Mayor are perfectly on target, although Burnett's interpretation of the disapproving kangaroo mom lacks real distinction. Twentieth Century Fox's animation is in the mold of their previous films Ice Age
 and Robots
: a nice blend of rudimentary and inventive touches. And as long as the right-to-life movement doesn't again try to usurp the phrase, "A person's a person no matter how small" (Seuss, aka Theodore Geissel, once sued to stop them from using it), this new Horton Hears a Who!
 should enjoy a long life.


I'm probably being overly kind rating "Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!" as more than strictly average computer-animated kiddie fare, but two things swayed me. First, it's a relief not to have to put up with Mike Myers as a cretin in a cat suit. Second, after the Saturday morning screening I attended, every 4-year-old stood and applauded. With a movie like this, they're the critics, not me.
If you have a kid or have ever been one, you know the story. Horton (the voice of Jim Carrey) is a big gormless elephant lumbering happily through the jungle until the day he hears a voice coming from a dust-speck. On that speck is the entire village of Whoville, and in that village is the Mayor of Whoville (Steve Carell).
This is the kind of perspective-altering insight familiar to decades of dorm-room stoners, and "Hor ton" lays it out straight: "Your whole world fits on a flower in my world - we're in the middle of some amazing cosmic convergence!" Whoa.
Unfortunately, the rest of the jungle thinks Horton's hallucinating. Led by a fascist soccer-mom kangaroo (Carol Burnett) and the Wickersham Brothers - a tribe of rampaging blue simians who stand as Dr. Seuss's most inspired vision of mob-think - the animals come after the elephant with a vengeance, bent on immolating the speck in a vat of boiling Beezlenut oil. Apply the political witch-hunt parallels as you see fit.


"Horton Hears a Who!" represents a fresh, and mostly refreshing, approach in Hollywood's pillaging of the good doctor's oeuvre. Gone are the A-list stars in eye-sore make-up of Universal's live-action "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" (2000) and "The Cat in the Hat" (2003). Gone, too, is the witless vulgarity of a PG-rated Seuss flick desperate to pander to middle schoolers and teenagers.
Apparently as appalled by those films as the rest of us, Audrey Geisel (the author's widow) and her lawyers have handed over the new film to Fox Animation head Christopher Meledandri, who understands that a Seuss movie doesn't have to be hip to work. Quite the opposite, in fact.
Working with Blue Sky Animation ("Ice Age"), Meledandri and directors Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino have cooked up a visually luscious CGI jungle for their mop-topped critters to galumph around in. The trees have three-dimensional depth but they're recognizably Seussian in surrealist geometry; the animals mimic the author's sense of line and whimsy, with a dash of oddball hyper-cuteness derived from Japanese anime.
Even Whoville feels right: all loopy buildings and impossible kiddie-Escher staircases. There's a sequence involving a visit to the Whoville Observatory that's breathtakingly graceful - a fusion of Rube Goldberg, Wile E. Coyote, and Alexander Calder.
At the same time, "Horton" strains to fit in with all the other family "product" cluttering our multiplexes, DVD players, and landfills. The Whoville sequences have been turned into wham-bam slapstick, the vulture (Will Arnett) is now a scary villain with a Russian accent, and the less said the better about the Mayor's "sassy" black secretary (Niecy Nash; Wanda Sykes must have been busy doing Applebee's ads).
As if "I meant what I said and I said what I meant, an elephant's faithful, one hundred percent" (borrowed from "Horton Hatches the Egg") isn't enough, an extra feel-good message has been tacked on in the form of the Mayor's misunderstood son, Jo-jo, who's mostly silent, a la Paul Dano in "Little Miss Sunshine," but who eventually - well, let's just say he's voiced by teen singing heartthrob Jesse McCartney for a reason. Score one for the soundtrack CD.
Carrey can't always keep the smarmy pop-culture cross-references in check ("I love the smell of bananas in the morning," oy), and these deliver the expected easy laughs while betraying the essential simplicity of Dr. Seuss. Yet the overall tone is playful rather than forced, and even when "Horton" takes a side-alley into an anime action parody, I found myself laughing against my better judgment.
It's a tough balancing act and probably a futile one. As greedily as Hollywood looks upon these books as a franchise to strip-mine, the hard fact remains that what's good about them - Ted Geisel's untrendy gentleness, humor, and intelligence - resists translation to the big screen.
Which won't stop the studios from trying, obviously. At least "Horton Hears a Who!" understands that this story's moral - "A person's a person, no matter how small" - applies to the customers in the booster seats.


If I ran the circus, the gang that made the sturdy, witty, inventively animated Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!  would get first dibs on any future movie productions of the Theodor Seuss Geisel canon. Grinches have messed up recent live-action adaptations beyond repair: I do not like The Cat in the Hat , I do not like it, fancy that. But this exuberant translation of the 1954 classic  from the Blue Sky Studios folks who made Sisyphean drama out of a squirrel and a nut in Ice Age   is true to the Seuss vision, with a contemporary integrity that makes full use of CG power without sacrificing the delicacy of the author's springy, zingy illustrations. The new Horton  proves that in the care of a creative team prudent enough to keep the focus on the book's timeless mélange of eccentricities and ethics and steer clear of meta joking or condescension, there's new juice to be squeezed from old Seuss yet.
Certainly the excesses of the live-action Cat  and How the Grinch Stole Christmas  movies can't eclipse the durable genius of the good Doctor, who, in Horton , has created one of literature's great pachyderm role models. One day ''in the Jungle of Nool,'' as anyone who was ever an American child may remember, the title elephant hears the tiniest squeak coming from the smallest speck floating through the air, and discerns an entire universe in a dust mote. It's the residents of Who-ville he alone hears  city folks in a vulnerable universe teensy enough for Horton to carry on the head of a clover flower. And so, even though he can't see them, Horton tenderly carries the Whos to safety, despite outlandish obstacles in a jungle of naysayers, led by a bullying bossypouch of a kangaroo. His explanation, ''A person's a person, no matter how small,'' is a verity right up there with ''give peace a chance.'' Accordingly, the statement has been interpreted like a holy text. Completists may also want to track down Chuck Jones' animated 1970 TV version.
The actors who lend their voices to the film aren't people we generally think of as working ''small.'' But in a felicitous group effort guided by directors Jimmy Hayward (a Pixar alumnus) and Steve Martino (art director of Blue Sky's Robots), comic powerhouses Jim Carrey (as Horton), Steve Carell (as the Mayor), and Carol Burnett (as the sour Kangaroo) temper their own full-throttle performances with an unironic respect for the original text. The backup players (among them Seth Rogen, Will Arnett, Amy Poehler, and Isla Fisher) also swing in the breeze. The movie's visual pep complements the nonconformist glee of Seuss' line drawings. And when the entire population of Who-ville clangs and chimes to announce ''We are here!'' loud enough to be heard beyond their city limits, the noise is downright joyous.

 What distinguishes “Horton Hears a Who!” from the other recent Dr. Seuss film adaptations —“How the Grinch Stole Christmas” and “The Cat in the Hat,” in case you need reminding — is that it is not one of the worst movies ever made. That’s faint praise, I know, and I’m even willing to go a bit further. There are aspects of “Horton,” directed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino under the auspices of the 20th Century Fox animation unit responsible for the “Ice Age” movies, that are fresh and enjoyable, and bits that will gratify even a dogmatic and orthodox Seussian.  Unlike “The Grinch” and “The Cat,”  “Horton” does not try to flesh out the good doctor’s graphical world by means of sets, prosthetic makeup and the other accouterments of live-action moviemaking. The animation is free, supple and brightly colored, and the crazy curves and angles that Seuss arranged on the page pop into three dimensions with rubbery energy and elastic wit. Who-ville in particular — that speck-borne town with its spindly machinery and gravity-defying architecture — is a wondrously kinetic place. And the Jungle of Nool, where Horton passes his time and fights for survival of the Whos, is appropriately lush, inviting and strange.  But if “Horton Hears a Who!” offers a showcase of the visual inventiveness and technical flair that characterizes Hollywood-financed children’s animation these days, it also shows some of the limitations of the computer-animation, talking-animal genre. The filmmakers revel in the imaginative freedom their image-making technology affords, and use it with self-confidence and flair, especially in action sequences. (A chase through a field of bright pink clover is  lovely and thrilling.)  When it comes to telling the story, however, and drawing out the dimensions of the characters, this “Horton” supplements Dr. Seuss’s fable with pages from the battered, worn-out Hollywood family-film playbook.  All kinds of extraneous elements are added to the story. The Mayor of Who-ville, voiced by Steve Carell, is a beleaguered dad who has trouble communicating with his son, a moody emo boy named Jo-Jo. The problem with this father-son reconciliation narrative is not that it is un-Seussian — though such intergenerational melodrama almost never figured in Dr. Seuss’s work — but that  it’s tired and sentimental. You don’t get the sense that the writers (Ken Daurio and Cinco Paul) actually believe in it. It just feels like something they know they’re supposed to do.  The excitable sidekick is another such requirement, and here that duty is taken on by Seth Rogen in the role of Morton, a motor-mouthed mouse who is Horton’s best friend. Mr. Rogen’s casting, like Mr. Carell’s, is less a stunt than a kind of pop-culture insurance clause. Get some box-office-proven comedians to do the voice work — Jonah Hill, Isla Fisher and Dan Fogler make up part of the B team here, in smaller parts — and you can’t fail.  And “Horton Hears a Who!” probably won’t, at least as a commercial proposition. But the star whose presence is clearly meant to be its gold-plated guarantee of success — Jim Carrey as Horton — is also the source of its most egregious failure. Mr. Carrey, who also played the Grinch,  can be an agile and restrained actor when the mood strikes him. But  the steadfast elephant is a vehicle for an endless, grating avalanche of clowning and riffing.  Mr. Carrey    not only breaks character with his  goofing, he also all but destroys the nobility and sweetness that make  Horton such a durable hero of children’s literature.  Horton is loyal, stubborn and compassionate — traits that are all drowned out in the static of Mr. Carrey’s performance and the hectic proliferation of subplots. It is lucky that just enough of the basic story survives to give the movie a touch of gravity and suspense. Horton, hearing the voices of the Whos on their little speck, must protect them from a moralizing kangaroo (Carol Burnett) and her henchfolk, who include a Russian vulture (Will Arnett) and a band of aristocratically named apes.  Meanwhile, the citizens of Who-ville must band together to make their presence known in the larger universe. It’s a marvelous tale, and a hard one to ruin. And the makers of “Horton Hears a Who!” haven’t, though I fear it was not for lack of trying.  DR.

A story of Horton, and people called Who -- but how many movies? It seems to be two! There's one that's quite Seussical, gentle and charming. The other stars Jim Carrey, brash and alarming! What auds will attend? Who has what it takes? Wee innocent children -- and moms with headaches!
Helmed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino, this large-scale, big-effects animated take on the 1954 Dr. Seuss tale "Horton Hears a Who!" (directed by Chuck Jones for TV in 1970) really does have a split personality. When Charles Osgood is narrating the very simple tale of the elephant with a big heart and big ears -- Horton can hear the tiny inhabitants of Whoville, whose miniature world is in peril -- the story is quite innocent and child-friendly. Elsewhere, not so much.
The problem is, the beloved Dr. Seuss (aka Theodore Geisel) didn't write movie-size stories -- his best-known cartoon adaptation, "How the Grinch Stole Christmas," had to be padded and scored just to supply a half-hour of television. In the case of the new "Horton," it has fallen to scribes Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio ("College Road Trip") to, shall we say, accessorize the good doctor. What we get is action for action's sake, cartoon violence and a whole lot of hubbub.
Despite the movie's motto -- "A person's a person, no matter how small" (Geisel once sued a pro-life group to stop them from using it) -- the film apparently needed such "comedy giants" (Fox's words) as Carrey, Steve Carell and Carol Burnett to do it justice. This is a touchy issue, and not just for the hundreds of vocal talents left unemployed by the craze for celebrity voiceovers; it's unclear whether such names really mean much in the way of B.O. for animated films. And while someone like Jerry Seinfeld was probably indispensable to "Bee Movie," it's hard to say what exactly Carrey, Carell and Burnett bring to "Horton."
The real stars of the movie are the animators, who imbue even the overgrowth in Horton's jungle with a certain floppy Seuss-ishness. When the apelike Wickersham brothers are firing bananas out of their armpits, the film attains Tex Avery-grade nuttiness. The visual gags are mostly just great, great fun.
A couple of the non-Seuss lines, too, are near-classic ("You take care of that meatball, sir," Carrey's Horton tells Carell's mayor of Whoville, "and leave the freakin' out to me.") But the drive to overdo almost everything in the film only emphasizes how thinly stretched the story is, and how movies almost always resort to violence and violent action when no one knows what else to do.
Every time Osgood weighs back in with a few lines of Seuss (and not even all of the original "Horton" is used here), it imposes a sort of cultural whiplash.
Pic's producers seem to have been trying to make Carrey's "Aladdin," hoping that his manic delivery, like Robin Williams' in that 1992 Disney film, would be so in synch with the animation that it would lift auds right out of their seats. Not quite the case.
No elevating moments, but a few of pure mirth: "In my world," says one of the film's furry woodland creatures, "everybody's a pony, they eat rainbows and poop butterflies ... " Now that
 would be something to see.


The allegory of Dr. Seuss 's charming Horton Hears a Who!  remains fluid today, and, like its crafty rhymes, ebbs and flows with the times. The determination of an innocent pachyderm known as Horton to stand up against tyranny and for the survival of the unseen Whos was once recognized as a reaction to McCarthyism. The pro-life movement, to Seuss's dismay, would later co-opt Horton's signature rallying call: "A person's a person, no matter how small!" And given his essential decency and unquenchable need to enlighten the world, I don't hesitate to see this venerable creature as a Jimmy Carter  type. Such is the generosity of Seuss's art: Beneath his bright, wild style thrive devilish moral and political ambiguities that invite our nuttiest observations and reflect our every belief. Now a CGI movie that you wouldn't be remiss in dreading after Ron Howard 's How the Grinch Stole Christmas , Horton Hears a Who!  has blessedly been conceived and executed in reverence to Seuss's story, padding out the original narrative with some meaningful new ideas and casting a mercifully muzzled Jim Carrey  as the titular beast. Rather than trivializing (or antagonizing with) its collision of secular and religious beliefs, the film recognizes how faith is an essential part of both value systems. Respect is what Horton's preaching, and that's a message to be foisted on children guilt-free.
