Brad Bird's first feature-length animated film, The Iron Giant
, remains a genuine masterpiece unsullied by more recent "advances" in animation technique. Scripted to perfection by Austin-based writer/director Tim McCanlies, it's a breathtaking, heartbreaking, soul-invigorating work of tremendous emotional power that has gone on to become standard issue in any home with kids or kids-at-heart. Bird's second feature and his first with Pixar, The Incredibles
, should've won (yet another) award for titular truthfulness. Bird's newest Pixar production is only slightly less of a revelation than his previous work, chiefly because the ongoing merger of animation, CGI, and live action into a new and fluxing form of meta-media has been steadily eroding our capacity for that old-fashioned "Gosh! Wow!" sense of wonder. Bird knows (as few others do) that a good film, animated or otherwise, lives and dies on the narrative crux; you can match-move, motion-track-capture-and-control characters from now until Walt Disney defrosts, but a visual marvel minus a human emotion is like a sunset unseen. Ratatouille
 is the story of a young rat named Remy (voiced by Oswalt), who longs to leave behind the gauche and pedestrian comestibles that feed his breed in favor of creating his own haute cuisine in the culinary capital of the world: Paris! Via some extremely clever narrative maneuvering on the part of Bird and co-screenwriter Jan Pinkava, Remy succeeds, sort of, by entering into a Cyrano de Bergerac
-style partnership with Linguini (Romano), a trod-upon garbage boy at former four-star restaurant Gusteau's, who's loathed and abused by the archetypically tyrannical chef Skinner (Holm). Linguini begins to find both his way and his spine through Remy's olfactory magic and a budding flirtation with the initially haughty cook Colette (Garofalo). Ratatouille
's main story is nicely augmented by a subplot revolving around a chilly and much-feared restaurant critic (voiced by O'Toole, though realized perfectly in all
 ways) and Remy's obligations to his more streetwise species. Pixar's animation is simply flawless; colorful, deeply realized, and ably conveying both the chaos of the kitchen, and the sensual allure of food well prepared. So much so, that I'd recommend foregoing the concession stand (and, if you're a hardcore foodie, storming it � la Bastille and burning it to the ground for crimes against la palette de humanit�
, exempting, of course, the Alamo Drafthouse) in favor of a post-screening trip to the March� d'Int�r�t National de Rungis or Central Market. Whichever's closer.


Like a lot of people, I don't pretend to know how the folks at Pixar
 do it. How do they make you love a rat? This isn't merely a question of technology, although the technical questions persist (where exactly does the camera go?). It's more of a spiritual matter. How do 
you give a rat a soul? I don't really want to know. I'll just be a child about it: It's magic. I know it's magic because the week I saw Pixar's new movie, "Ratatouille ," there was a small rodent invasion at my home, and I left this movie worried that one of my traps might fatally snap on a gourmet rat like Remy, the movie's star. This is crazy, but there you have it.
Voiced by the comedian Patton Oswalt , Remy is a foodie -- part snob, part epicure, totally bewildered that no one else can tell the difference between a morel and chanterelle. This guy is an alchemist. His obsession with the gustatory possibilities of mixing ingredients turns out to be serious. In one lovely sequence, the scene goes black around him as he tries out a toasted goat cheese, mushroom, rosemary treat. The combination is a jackpot, and when he tastes it the screen goes wild with color. These same ingredients, eaten by his dim, gluttonous brother, Emile (Peter Sohn ), leave the screen comically dulled, like a dud firecracker compared to Remy's Fourth of July sparklers.
Sadly, Remy has been living with Emile, their father, Django (Brian Dennehy ), and about a zillion other rats in the streets and sewers, using his refined olfactory sense to detect whether the food swiped from the garbage by his grubby, uncultured colony contains poison. He wants more for himself. He wants to be a chef at a five-star restaurant, not one for rodents, one for people -- people who happen to hate rodents. His father detests humans and forbids Remy to walk like homo sapiens (when he does, it's to keep his paws clean).
After he's separated from the colony, Remy's wish begins to come true. He's swept to the surface of a city he's shocked to discover is Paris (it gleams like a Fabergé egg). Not only that, he's in the kitchen of his favorite chef's restaurant. The late Gusteau (Brad Garrett) produced a culinary legacy that the current head chef -- a gnome named Skinner (Ian Holm) with Peter Lorre's face -- is guiltily leasing as a series of down-market microwaveable dinners (Chopsocky Pockets!).
Up to this moment, "Ratatouille," which Brad Bird has lovingly written and directed, is sweetly conventional. It's just the classic up-from-nothing, don't-forget-where-you-came-from story. It's "The Jazz Singer." It's "Ratz n the Hood." But in the kitchen, which is Remy's obstacle course, and around Paris, "Ratatouille" becomes exceptional. A whooshing kinetic energy takes over. The movie doesn't have to strain for liftoff the way Pixar's "Cars" did (that movie had a Volvo's boxiness. "Ratatouille" keeps inventing surprises.
Remy arrives at the restaurant the same day a ropey, meek American kid named Linguini (Lou Romano) shows up: He's Gusteau's son. The kid is handed a garbage boy job, but when Remy catches him fiddling with a pot of soup, he instinctively swoops in to improve it. The restaurant has lost one of its five stars, and the menu hasn't changed in ages, but the soup is a hit, and a disbelieving Skinner commands the unwitting Linguini to do it again. So the movie sets out to forge a friendship between gangly heir and rat.
They strike a deal in a beautiful nighttime sequence on the banks of the Seine. Afterward , the young man takes the young rodent home to his small apartment with a fabulous view. There Remy tries to transfer his instincts to Linguini by pulling his hair (when the rats in this movie speak, all the humans hear are their squeaks ). Only Sonny Chiba teaching Uma Thurman how to be a samurai in "Kill Bill" is more amusing and lovingly detailed.
Bird has written up a storm. With Remy under his hat, Linguini has to cook more soup, while fooling Skinner, who swears he can smell a rat, and winning over the rest of the Gusteau kitchen staff, including the lone woman (Janeane Garofalo ) , whom he likes. There is the business of the legitimacy of Linguini's parentage (it could obstruct Skinner's inheritance of the restaurant) and Remy's reunion with his brother, dad, and brood.
There are breakups, make ups, the reluctant appearance of the country's most important restaurant critic (Peter O'Toole ), and one marvelously nauseating passage in which dozens of sous-chef rats break every health code violation in the book. "Ratatouille" might be the year's most densely plotted Hollywood movie. By the second hour, it's definitely the strangest. Sweetbreads become a must-have dish. And seriously: Rats stir pots and chop veggies! If this is revolting (and it is), the movie is also touching in small but profound ways.
For one thing, all the voice work here is excellent, especially Oswalt's. He sounds like Paul Giamatti but with a greater capacity for confidence. He makes Remy's excitement over being in a kitchen contagious. For another, Bird and the animators have thought of everything. Yeah, the bodies are diverse and life like. And, indeed, the food looks delicious ( Linguini awakes to an omelet from Remy that brought tears to my eyes; and the movie's title dish belongs in the Louvre before it belongs on a plate). But it's the even smaller moments that are truly dazzling: grains of salt on a counter, the drop of faucet water Remy uses to wash his paws, the stray crumbs on the floor discreetly under carts and along baseboards, the way the restaurant critic looks like something Klimt would have painted if he lived in a morgue. This isn't pedantic design. It's perfection.
Bird also wrote and directed "The Incredibles ," Pixar's best movie, and there's a generosity of human spirit here that unites the two . In "Ratatouille," that spirit even extends to that joyless food critic. His response to a meal is so nearly Proustian that it inspires an eloquent and respectful review about a work of art that opens your eyes and rewires your senses. I knew what he meant. A few hours after "Ratatouille," I replaced the Velveeta in my mouse trap with a piece of gruyere.


         Brad Bird's 'Ratatouille' is so audacious you have to fall in love with its unlikely hero. If we are living in a golden age of animation — and we are — one of the reasons is writer-director Brad Bird. That's somewhat ironic, because as his new "Ratatouille" demonstrates, what makes Bird so unusual is that he doesn't really think of himself as an animator at all.
 
  From his exceptional previous features ("The Iron Giant" and "The Incredibles") through this one, Bird has refused to ghettoize himself, refused to back off from his passion to make movies whose animated surface doesn't stop them from touching the same emotional bases as live-action fare. When Pixar executive producer John Lasseter says, "There's a level of depth, complexity and humor to this film that I don't think any Pixar film has had before," he's not giving in to hyperbole, he's getting at the heart of Bird's concerns.
 


         






   The story of another creature that refuses to be ghettoized, in this case a rat — yes, a rat — with the palate of an epicure and a passion to be the greatest chef in the world, "Ratatouille" is as audacious as they come. It takes risks and goes places other films wouldn't dare, and it ends up putting rival imaginations in the shade.
 
 Whereas  the tendency in so much of today's animation is to be glib and on the surface, "Ratatouille" and its Pixar brethren have carved out a place for themselves by being genuinely smart and sophisticated in ways that please audiences as much as critics.
 
  "Ratatouille" also takes full advantage of what the medium of computer animation offers. As much as story, director Bird and his team love great chases, wild rides and wacky adventures, and setting this film both in a breathtakingly beautiful Paris and the unnerving sewers beneath the city offers ample opportunity for all manner of visual play.
 
 Although  mice have been members in good standing of the animation community at least since Ub Iwerks drew Mickey Mouse in 1928, the idea (which started with animator Jan Pinkava, who shares a story credit) of making a rat the hero of a major motion picture is a lot nervier than having penguins or other cuddly folk in the first position.
 
  And, to its credit, "Ratatouille" is surprisingly candid about letting rats be rats. Yes, our hero Remy walks on his hind legs (the better to keep his front paws clean for eating) and has a face as expressive as that of a Yiddish theater actor, but his fellow rats swarm in such realistic packs it is a real gut-check to see them scurrying about. And asking audiences to accept them as heroes is a riskier gambit still.
 
  Yet this is exactly what Bird and his gang accomplish. They've made "Ratatouille" so imaginative, good spirited and funny that it not only blurs the line between reality and fantasy, it manages to blur it between species as well. And it does it all, an amusing "Quality Assurance Guarantee" boasts in the closing credits, with "100% Genuine Animation! No motion capture or any other performance shortcuts were used in the production of this film."
 
 Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a character as endearing as Remy (winningly voiced by comic Patton Oswalt) as a protagonist. Someone with the soul of a poet as well as such a highly developed sense of taste and smell that his father uses him as a poison tester, Remy ignores his family's garbage-eating proclivities and insists, "If you are what you eat, I only want to eat good stuff."
 
 Remy's hero is the legendary Parisian chef Auguste Gusteau, whose "anyone can cook" motto he takes to heart. Gusteau, sadly, is no longer among the living, done in by, among other things, the acid words of cadaverous food critic Anton Ego, a.k.a. "The Grim Eater," splendidly voiced by the man Bird wrote the part for, Peter O'Toole.
 
 Several tricks of fate bring Remy not only to Paris, but to Gusteau's itself, now run by the villainous Skinner (Ian Holm), an entrepreneur more interested in selling over-hyped frozen food than running a great restaurant.
 
 Also arriving at the same time is Linguini (Lou Romano), an awkward young man, the son of a former employee, who dreams of chefdom but who has no discernible talent in that area. Hired as a garbage boy, his chances of advancement are nil. Until he meets Remy.
 
 One of the joys of "Ratatouille" is watching as these two discover that they need each other — Linguini can't cook without Remy's guidance, and Remy wouldn't be allowed to set foot in a kitchen without Linguini as a front man — and then painstakingly construct a Rube Goldberg system that allows them to work together without speaking the same language.
 
  Making the whole thing stranger still is that Remy is in constant communication with a vision of the late great chef Gusteau (Brad Garrett of "Everybody Loves Raymond"), who doesn't let being a figment of Remy's imagination stop him from giving great advice.
 
 Also sharing kitchen wisdom was real-life master chef Thomas Keller of Northern California's  French Laundry, who contributed to "Ratatouille's" impressive accuracy about how restaurants operate. He designed the film's signature dish and even got to voice the part of an eager patron.
 
  "Ratatouille's" plot offers numerous twists, turns and surprises, but perhaps none so impressive as its refusal to soft-pedal the ages-old antipathy between rats and people, the generations of mistrust and disgust on both sides. Getting a leopard to change its spots would be nothing compared with  what the characters are asked to do here.
 
 It is the film's ability to build those characters, to construct recognizable individuals we can invest in, that is the heart of "Ratatouille's" success. Even when a voice  as well-known as that of Janeane Garofalo, who plays a chef named Colette, is  heard, it's the character we are listening to hardest, not the celebrity. In an animated film, you can't ask for more than that.
 
 
 "Ratatouille." MPAA rating: G. Running time: 1 hour, 51 minutes. In general release.   

It's always a pleasure to walk into a new movie from Pixar, those kinetic wizards of shiny sculpted animation who gave us the Toy Story  films, Finding Nemo , and Cars , because it's a safe bet that you're in for a sparkly good time  or, just maybe, a great one. In the case of the antic kiddie gourmet comedy Ratatouille , which might be described as Anatole the mouse meets Emeril Live , the expectations are high: The writer-director is Brad Bird, who made The Incredibles  (2004), and it would be hard to name an animated film, from Pixar or anyone else, that was ever more incredible.
The hero of Ratatouille  is  let's not mince words  a rat, with scruffy bluish fur and what might be called a highly developed sense of garbage. His name is Remy (he's voiced by the comedian Patton Oswalt) and really, once you get past any negative associations you may have about rodents (what would an animated fable be if it didn't fight prejudice?), he's a very sweet guy, with a knack that might qualify him as a genius. He's a natural-born chef. It starts with his quivery pink nose, which can suss out the inner essence of any ingredient, from cheese to chervil. While on a rooftop, he gets struck by lightning, which singes the mushroom he's holding, zapping it into a succulent barbecued delicacy, for which he must then locate the absolute perfect seasoning (it's saffron, in case you were wondering).
Remy, with his overly refined flavor buds, is the odd fellow out amid his scavenger rat pack of country relatives, who regard his good taste as fussiness. But when he's flushed through a sewer into the center of Paris, he ends up at Gusteau's, a once-legendary restaurant (its deceased celebrity chef gets conjured up as a friendly ghost), and before long he has become the kitchen's star cook. Considering that he's a rat, you may wonder how, exactly, this is accomplished.
Here's how: Remy befriends Linguini (Lou Romano), a freckled, redheaded doofus of a scullery boy blessed with no talent whatsoever. Before long, everyone is convinced that he's doing the cooking. Actually, though, it's Remy, who sits under Linguini's toque, pulling tufts of his hair to manipulate his limbs, flinging him around the kitchen like a rag doll so that he tosses the proper ingredients into the pot. Quel  wacky rubber-limbed slapstick weirdness! Overnight, the restaurant turns hot. But can Remy and Linguini triumph over the evil head chef, a sawed-off Napoleonic control freak (Ian Holm)? And what about the brooding, cadaverous, ultimate-snob food critic Anton Ego? He looks like a macabre Tim Burton puppet and is voiced by Peter O'Toole, who lends dramatic oomph to lines like ''If I don't love it, I don't swallow!'' Will he deign to give them a good review?
If it sounds like I'm less than excited about these questions, that's because the movie isn't either. Ratatouille  is a blithe concoction, as well as a miraculously textured piece of animated design. The foggy Paris streets glow with gaslight romance, and the surfaces of Gusteau's kitchen have such a vibrant photorealist sheen that you want to reach out and touch them, especially if you're a foodie (and, really, who isn't these days?). You can make out every nick and cranny in the polished copper pots and just about smell all of those intoxicating ingredients. When Remy scurries around onto the pipes behind the restaurant walls, the camera tracks him in a loop-the-loop fury, and the pure technical dazzle of the sequence is a delight.
As a story, however, Ratatouille  is fun without very much surprise. It's like a fusty old Disney cartoon retrofitted with the Pixar sheen. The lack of celebrity voices is a major drawback, since Remy ends up with very little personality. Contrast him with, say, the bad-boy Owen Wilson speedster in Cars , and you're seeing the difference between a hero with spice and a bland one who happens to know where the spice rack is. Linguini, too, is a one-note stumblebum; you keep wishing the film had given him a touch more dignity, or made more of his romance with the kitchen's feisty, and very French, female chef (Janeane Garofalo). Ratatouille  lacks a forceful center of gravity.
At this point, I must pose a consumer-service question: Will kiddies really want to see a movie about a rat who's a champion gourmand? And will adults warm up to an animated comedy in which an army of long-tailed wrigglies ends up taking over the kitchen? If the movie had a wilder time with its belief in culinary democracy  the notion that, in Gusteau's words, ''Anyone can cook''  perhaps its triumph-of-the-rodent noodlings would come off as heroic rather than rote. As it is, Ratatouille has the Pixar technical magic without, somehow, the full Pixar flavor. It's Brad Bird's genial dessert, not so much incredible as merely sweetly edible.


 The moral of “Ratatouille” is delivered by a critic: a gaunt, unsmiling fellow named Anton Ego who composes his acidic notices in a coffin-shaped room and who speaks in the parched baritone of Peter O’Toole. “Not everyone can be a great artist,” Mr. Ego muses. “But a great artist can come from anywhere.”  Quite so. Written and directed by Brad Bird  and displaying the usual meticulousness associated with the Pixar brand, “Ratatouille” is a nearly flawless piece of popular art, as well as one of the most persuasive portraits of an artist ever committed to film. It provides the kind of deep, transporting pleasure, at once simple and sophisticated, that movies at their best have always promised.  Its sensibility, implicit in Mr. Ego’s aphorism, is both exuberantly democratic and unabashedly elitist, defending good taste and aesthetic accomplishment not as snobbish entitlements but as universal ideals. Like “The Incredibles,” Mr. Bird’s earlier film for Pixar, “Ratatouille” celebrates the passionate, sometimes aggressive pursuit of excellence, an impulse it also exemplifies.  The hero (and perhaps Mr. Bird’s alter ego) is Remy (Patton Oswalt), a young rat who lives somewhere in the French countryside and conceives a passion for fine cooking. Raised by garbage-eaters, he is drawn toward a more exalted notion of food by the sensitivity of his own palate and by the example of Auguste Gusteau (Brad Garrett), a famous chef who insists —  more in the manner of Julia Child than of his real-life haute cuisine counterparts — that “anyone can cook.”  What Remy discovers is that anyone, including his uncultured brother, can be taught to appreciate intense and unusual flavors. (How to translate the reactions of the nose and tongue by means of sound and image is a more daunting challenge, one that the filmmakers, including Michael Giacchino, author of the marvelous musical score, meet with effortless ingenuity.) Remy’s budding culinary vocation sets him on a lonely course, separating him from his clannish, philistine family and sending him off, like so many young men from the provinces before him, to seek his fortune in Paris. That city, from cobblestones to rooftops, is brilliantly imagined by the animators.  And, as usual in a Pixar movie, a whole new realm of physical texture and sensory detail has been conquered for animation. “Finding Nemo” found warmth in the cold-blooded, scaly creatures of the deep; “Cars” brought inert metal to life. At first glance, “Ratatouille” may look less groundbreaking, since talking furry rodents are hardly a novelty in cartoons. But the innovations are nonetheless there, in the fine grain of every image: in the matted look of wet rat fur and the bright scratches in the patina of well-used copper pots, in the beads of moisture on the surface of cut vegetables and the sauce-stained fabric of cooks’ aprons.  Individually, the rats are appealing enough, but  the sight of dozens of them swarming through pantries and kitchens is appropriately icky, and Mr. Bird acknowledges that interspecies understanding may have its limits.  Perhaps because animation,  especially the modern computer-assisted variety, is the work of so many hands and the product of so much invested capital, we are used to identifying animated movies with their corporate authors: Disney, DreamWorks, Pixar and so on. But while the visual effects in “Ratatouille” show a recognizable company stamp, the sensibility that governs the story is unmistakably Mr. Bird’s. A veteran of “The Simpsons” and a journeyman writer for movies and television, he has emerged as an original and provocative voice in American filmmaking.  He is also, at least implicitly, a severe critic of the laziness and mediocrity that characterize so much popular culture. He criticizes partly by example, by avoiding the usual kid-movie clichés and demonstrating that a clear, accessible story can also be thoughtful and unpredictable. “Ratatouille” features no annoying sidekick and no obtrusive celebrity voice-work, and while Remy is cute, he can also be prickly, demanding and insecure.  Moreover, his basic moral conflict — between family obligation and individual ambition — is handled with unusual subtlety and complexity, so that the reassurances and resolutions of the movie’s end feel earned  rather than predetermined.  And while the film buzzes with eye-pleasing action and incident — wild chases, hairbreadth escapes, the frenzied choreography of a busy kitchen — it does not try to overwhelm its audience with excessive noise and sensation. Instead Mr. Bird integrates story and spectacle with the light, sure touch that Vincente Minnelli brought to his best musicals and interweaves the tale of Remy’s career with beguiling subplots and curious characters.  Since no Parisian restaurant will let a rat work in its kitchen, Remy strikes a deal with a hapless low-level worker named Linguini (Lou Romano), who executes Remy’s recipes by means of an ingenious (and hilarious) form of under-the-toque puppetry. Linguini’s second mentor is Colette (Janeane Garofalo), a tough sous-chef who unwittingly becomes the rodent’s rival for Linguini’s allegiance. Even minor figures — assistant cooks, waiters,  a hapless health inspector — show remarkable individuality.  At stake in “Ratatouille” is not only Remy’s ambition but also the hallowed legacy of Gusteau, whose ghost occasionally floats before Remy’s eyes and whose restaurant is in decline. Part of the problem is Gusteau’s successor, Skinner (Ian Holm), who is using the master’s name and reputation to market a line of mass-produced frozen dinners.  Against him, Remy and Mr. Bird take a stand in defense of an artisanal approach that values both tradition and individual talent: classic recipes renewed by bold, creative execution. The movie’s grand climax, and the source of its title, is the preparation of a rustic dish made of common vegetables — a dish made with ardor and inspiration and placed, as it happens, before a critic.  And what, faced with such a ratatouille, is a critic supposed to say? Sometimes the best response is the simplest. Sometimes “thank you” is enough.

"Ratatouille" is delicious. In this satisfying, souffle-light tale of a plucky French rodent with a passion for cooking, the master chefs at Pixar have blended all the right ingredients -- abundant verbal and visual wit, genius slapstick timing, a soupcon of Gallic sophistication -- to produce a warm and irresistible concoction that's sure to appeal to everyone's inner Julia Child. Though the latest crowd-pleaser from "The Incredibles" writer-director Brad Bird arguably reps a harder sell than earlier Disney/Pixar toon outings, the combo of critical excitement, energetic word of mouth and shrewd marketing should make this family-friendly feast a gastronomical success worldwide.
After the less than universally admired "Cars," Pixar's eighth feature sees the Disney-owned toon studio in very fine form, and confirms Bird's reputation as one of the medium's most engaging storytellers. Compared to his woefully underseen "The Iron Giant" and Oscar-winning "The Incredibles," "Ratatouille" may be smaller in scope, but in telling the story of a very smart rat striving to enter the very human world of French haute cuisine, it shares with its predecessors an affinity for gifted outsiders seeking personal fulfillment.
Pic also extends two of the great themes of "The Incredibles": the pursuit of excellence over mediocrity (a standard that has long distinguished Pixar from rivals and imitators) and the importance -- or rather, the unavoidability -- of family ties. Remy, a thin blue rat who lives with his unruly rodent clan in the French countryside, finds himself torn between these two commitments as the film opens.
Blessed with unusually sharp senses, Remy (voiced by comedian Patton Oswalt) is educated, cultured and mad about creating his own culinary master-pieces -- the complete opposite of his tubby, good-natured brother Emile (Peter Sohn) and gruff dad Django (Brian Dennehy), who are content to wallow in trash and disapprove of Remy's all-too-human higher ambitions.
After an unfortunate cooking mishap, the rats are evicted from their rural nest and forced to escape through the sewers -- where, in the first of many nim-bly orchestrated action sequences, Remy is separated from his family. He winds up in Paris, near a restaurant once presided over by the legendary chef Auguste Gusteau, whose populist motto ("Anyone can cook!") rings in Remy's ears as he spies longingly on the bustling kitchen activity.
One busy evening, Remy can't resist sneaking in and spicing up a vat of soup; credit for the delicious dish goes to the poor garbage boy, Linguini (Lou Romano), a clumsy, stammering type with no talent for cooking, who is immediately ordered by conniving head chef Skinner (Ian Holm) to reproduce his success.
While man and mouse experience difficulty communicating at first, they ultimately agree to team up, a la "Cyrano de Bergerac": Linguini can keep his job, and Remy can slice and dice to his heart's content. The result is a classic odd-couple comedy in which Linguini and his "little chef" must learn to work together, avoid discovery and, inevitably, deal with the internal and external pressures that threaten their unlikely partnership. 
Among those threats are the kitchen's lone female, Colette (a tough-talking but tender Janeane Garofalo), whom Linguini inevitably falls for; the up-to-no-good Skinner, who's both suspicious and jealous of Linguini's success; and an uber-acerbic restaurant critic, aptly named Anton Ego (a sneering Peter O'Toole), who once ruined Gusteau's reputation.
Premise was originally conceived by Jan Pinkava (who left Pixar before the project's completion but is credited here as a co-director) before Bird took over the reins -- a transition that may explain why some of the secondary characters and subplots feel a tad rote, particular in the more manic later stretches, though the overall execution is never less than involving.
But "Ratatouille" is at its finest in the kitchen, as Remy learns to whip up sauces and sweetbreads while directing Linguini's movements from beneath the latter's cap. The joy of artistic creation is both palpable and infectious, and Bird and his supremely inventive team of animators and designers respond in kind -- giving viewers a glimpse of mouth-wateringly realistic cuisine one moment, dazzling them with some delightfully Keaton-esque slapstick the next.
After the superhero spoof of "The Incredibles" and the auto anthropomorphism of "Cars," the idea of yet another talking-critter toon might strike some auds as overly quaint and familiar. But the last thing "Ratatouille" wants to serve up is yet another shrill, jabbering, pop-culture-referencing menagerie. Under Bird's careful direction, Remy, with his persuasively rat-like movements and meek nods and shrugs, delivers one of the more endearing and soulful animal "performances" in recent memory. Oswalt's dialogue delivery, though consistent with the generally superb voicework, never dominates the charac-ter's expressive range.
As ever with Pixar, there's the sense that a complex world has been beautifully and minutely imagined from the inside out, one where it's clear the film-makers have done their homework (what other family movie would bother to explain the meaning of a demie chef de partie
?). The entire produc-tion is a captivating visual delight, as the fluid shifts between human and rodent perspective, and the camera's sensitivity to different gradations of light and color, are nothing short of stunning. As an impossibly romantic valentine to the City of Lights, pic could give both the recent "Paris, je t'aime" and the forthcoming "2 Days in Paris" a run for their money.
Wide-ranging score by Michael Giacchino ("The Incredibles") stays perfectly in sync with the action, encompassing string- and accordion-based Gallic overtones as well as a light percussion that suggests the scampering of rat paws.
Pic is preceded by an amusing Gary Rydstrom-directed short, "Lifted," which cheekily imagines a driver's ed lesson aboard a UFO. 


Brad Bird  has spent most of his career making "cartoons"a cinematic form that is afforded about as much serious artistic credibility as the slasher moviebut he deserves to be considered one of the most inspired storytellers at work in American movies. With Ratatouille , he takes the raw ingredients of an anthropomorphic-animal kiddie matinee and whips them into a heady brew about nothing less than the principles of artistic creation.
None of that should come as much surprise to anyone who saw Bird's two previous features: The Incredibles , with its art-deco fever dream of a superhero family hiding out in suburbia, and The Iron Giant , whose titular robot turned out to be considerably more humane than the government agents hot on his trail. Like the Iron Giant, Ratatouille 's rodent hero is a non-human unwilling to accept the role assigned to him by society.
When we first meet young Remy (Patton Oswalt ), his olfactory gifts have reduced him to serving as "poison sniffer" for his garbage-foraging colony. But Remy dreams of becoming a fine French chef, and gets his chance when he lands on the doorstep of Gusteau's,a once-grand flagship restaurant now reduced to a glorified tourist attraction. Remy's arrival coincides with that of Linguini (Lou Romano ), a bumbling kid whose cooking proves unfit even for rodent consumption. But with a little help from a certain four-legged intrudervoila! From trash heap to magnifique!
As has been widely reported, the Pixar -produced Ratatouille  was begun by another director and taken over by Bird well into the development process. Yet the film is unmistakably Bird's own, not least in its focus on the disparity between art and commerce, greatness and mediocrity. But the most provocative gesture is surely its vivid exultation of haute cuisine. It's a slow-food movie for a fast-food nation, distributed by a company known for its McDonald's  marketing tie-ins.
Fret not, parents: Bird hasn't made one of those hipster family films that sails over the heads of its intended audience. Ratatouille  is as much a feast for the senses as it is food for thought.
