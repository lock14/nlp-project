If anybody bothered to ask movie critics, we�d tell you that the fastest way to solve the population problem is to expose those of childbearing years to a cartoon sneak preview, with its packed house of squirming, screaming little, er, angels
. I mention this only to set my mood (cantankerous): That is to say, I was in no way prepared to like this film. The perfunctory opening scenes didn�t help: There�s Marty the Zebra (voiced by Rock), who is weary of pampering at the Central Park Zoo and lusting for a life in the wild. There�s his grab-bag of wisecracking best friends: the self-centered showman, Alex the Lion (Stiller); sassy hippo Gloria (Pinkett Smith); and glum hypochondriac Melman the Giraffe (Schwimmer). Gently amusing stuff, sure, but nothing terribly inspiring � that is, until a bookish primate makes a crack about throwing monkey poo at Tom Wolfe, and Madagascar
 dangles the possibility of being something slightly nutter. Consider that possibility mostly realized: After its leaden beginning, Madagascar
 launches into a lunatic pace of left-field pop-culture references and physics-defying physical comedy worthy of the Looney Tunes
 of yore. When Marty the Zebra hooks up with a quartet of penguins (the birdmen of this particular Alcatraz, they are plotting an escape to Antarctica), he too breaks out of the zoo and hoofs it to Grand Central Station, in order to catch a train for the wilds of � Connecticut. Like its jailbreak protagonists, the film grows more ambitious outside the confines of the zoo and truly takes off when the four best friends accidentally wash up on the shores of Madagascar and are stranded in a lemur country ruled by an idiot king (voiced by no less than Ali G, aka Sacha Baron Cohen). It�s a kick watching Lion, Zebra, Giraffe, and Hippo � city folk who fish bagels out of the trash and thrash in their sleep unless they are lulled by New York�s peculiar symphony of sirens and shoot-�em-ups � try to adapt to life in the wild. Smaller children, however, might be lightly terrorized when Alex the Lion�s carnivore instincts kick in with a junkie�s jittery fervor. In truth, Madagascar
 boasts a black comic bent that might not be entirely kid-friendly, as in a scene that works as a food-chain primer: See pretty chickadee; see pretty chickadee get crocodile-chomped; smirk to one�s self as Louis Armstrong warbles "What a Wonderful World" in the background. But it�s all so terrifically silly � in just the right ways � that the darker stuff probably won�t make a dent, anyway (nor will the cheeky asides to Chariots of Fire
, Cast Away
, and American Beauty
). The somewhat-rote life lessons that cartoons � sorry, animated features
 � require are all in attendance (the importance of friendship, check; risk-taking, check) and somewhat gum up the fun, as does an overriding philosophy that doesn�t quite shake down, but maybe that�s just the crank in me coming out again. Forget life lessons: I much prefer a lemur king doing the robot.


Regardless of the merits of ''Madagascar," I think we can all agree that the marketing campaign has been a breathtaking achievement, a mass-scale act of brand imprinting that deserves the full four stars.
As far back as last October, my younger daughter was already lisping, ''Father? May I please see 'Madagascar' when it opens wide on May 27th?" By December, she and her friends knew all the major characters -- How? When? Was this information delivered on a subsonic level during commercial breaks on Nickelodeon? Hidden in specially marked bags of Skittles? -- and there were rumors that DreamWorks PR had offered a year's college tuition to toddlers whose first word was ''Madagascar." The plush, talking penguin tie-in toy that appeared on my desk a month ago (it had become known that my daughter was a penguin freak) could be considered a bribe only if she had had any remaining mind share to be exploited.
The problem with such an approach is that the movie had better live up to the hype, and outside of Pixar
, precious few of the new computer-animated family films deliver. So that deflating sound you hear is ''Madagascar" itself entering theaters: Antic, cute, scattershot, it's a remarkable-looking but terribly uncertain bit of CGI fluff, with its richest humor off to the sides of the action and a whole lot of average in the middle.
As your kids already know, we begin in New York's Central Park Zoo, where Alex the lion (Ben Stiller) is the pampered, preening star of the show. Think of him as an overpriced infielder for the Yankees: dining on steak, hitting the home runs, getting a little lazy. Over in the zebra pen is Marty (Chris Rock), whose high spirits have been laid low by a midlife crisis (he's 7). Marty knows there's more out there, but what? Connecticut?
''Madagascar" shakes a few solid laughs out of these citified animals -- I loved the chimp whose morning routine consists of fishing a cup of coffee, a bagel, and the Times out of a trash can -- and it introduces an element of prankish anarchy in a quartet of penguins making a jailbreak for Antarctica. (The lead penguin, Skipper, is a barking megalomaniac who sounds something like the love child of Danny DeVito and Edward G. Robinson; in fact, it's the voice of co-director Tom McGrath, pulling a Brad Bird.)
Convinced by the penguins that ''the wild" is the place to be, Marty makes a break for it, followed by the panicking Alex, a hypochondriac giraffe named Melman (David Schwimmer, neurasthenic as ever), and a homegirl hippo named Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith). After a few plot contortions, the quartet ends up shipped back to Africa, lost in a storm at sea, and washed ashore on the beaches of Madagascar, that large island with all the lemurs to the right of Mozambique.
Here's where the movie's visual approach starts paying dividends. The scenes at the zoo have looked boxy and unconvincing, like a Sims game from six years back, but the Madagascar of ''Madagascar" has the feel of a Rousseau painting -- all dark-outlined greenery and profusions of bright colors -- and the hyperstylized characters, who already look like they could have stepped from the pages of a mid-'50s Golden Book, fit right in.
If only the rest of the movie matched that level of invention. ''Madagascar" has two modes, slapstick and sitting around talking, and while the former is well-timed and diverting -- it helps if you're a ''Road Runner" fan -- the latter starts to drag. Marty and Alex have a beachfront feud that goes on forever, and the later scenes, in which the lion must come to grips with his inner carnivore, are allowed to become overly 
serious. I don't know that I've ever complained about too much 
character development before, but when a movie's surface is this beguiling, you want to stay there.
While they're trying to get off the island, the zoo animals meet a tribe of lemurs led by the happy-happy, not very bright partyboy King Julien XIII (Sacha Baron Cohen, a.k.a. Ali G). He has a morose assistant named Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer) and a saucer-eyed, hyperbolically ''cute" mouse lemur sidekick (Andy Richter). All these folks are great fun, as are the penguins, as are those chimps (one with a naff Terry-Thomas British accent voiced by Conrad Vernon, the other smelly and mute). Unfortunately, they're more fun than the leads.
In all, ''Madagascar" is a step up from ''Shark Tale," DreamWorks Animation's last outing, but it still lacks the simple narrative elegance Pixar seems to have patented. The pop-culture jokes aimed at parents are obscure enough to arc over their heads -- how many people will really get the ''Twilight Zone" 
reference when a lemur holds up a tome titled ''To Serve Lemurs" and yells ''It's a cookbook!" -- and the storytelling eventually (and literally) runs out of gas. The movie doesn't end so much as simply give up.
But, sure, take the kids, or wait for the DVD; it's an honest enough baby sitter. (If you want to bum the little ones out, though, tell 'em the real Central Park Zoo has no large animals except a sad, neurotic polar bear with repetitive behavior.) Just try to manage their expectations better than DreamWorks has. The expression on my daughter's face when the lights came up was that of a hardened young media veteran realizing, once again, that she'd been burned. And then she moved on.

         "Madagascar" is a classical gas. It's a good-humored, pleasant confection that has all kinds of relaxed fun bringing computer-animated savvy to the old-fashioned world of Looney Tunes cartoons.
 
  Though the slapstick antics of "Madagascar's" quartet of animal friends do not break any new ground, that doesn't stop them from being continually amusing. As directed by Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath, this film makes the most of the unfettered visual imagination its animators bring to the screen.
 


         






    "Madagascar" also benefits from not having any heavy moral to impart or life lesson to teach. It simply wants you to crack a smile, and with the expert voices of Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett Smith it has no trouble managing that.
 
  In some ways "Madagascar" is a spiritual descendant of another kind of animated cartoon, clay animation wizard Nick Park's 1990 Oscar-winning "Creature Comforts," which had zoo animals talking feelingly about their lot in life. This film also begins in a zoo, albeit one distinctly out of the ordinary.
 
  That would be New York's Central Park establishment, which the film conceives as a kind of luxury spa that caters to its inhabitants' every whim, from heat lamps and blow dryers to gourmet meals. After years of this kind of pampering, it's not surprising the animals have lost whatever survival skills they once had.
 
  Four amigos are the focus of our attention in this urban enclave. Alex the Lion (Stiller) is the zoo's Mr. Showbiz, a self-centered performer whose best friend is the more introspective Marty the Zebra (Rock). Melman the Giraffe (Schwimmer) is a certified hypochondriac who makes jokes about his health plan, and Gloria the Hippo (Pinkett Smith) is an easygoing type who doesn't hesitate to throw her weight around when it's necessary.
 
  Of the quartet, only Marty is restless. He hates to be interrupted when he dreams of wide-open spaces ("When the zebra's in the zone, leave him alone") and wonders if it would be possible to get to a place he's only heard about: "the wild."
 
  Also in the zoo and not averse to causing trouble is a quartet of penguins, cleverly presented as an elite commando unit determined to break out of the heavily fortified prison camp they consider Central Park to be.
 
  A series of (what else but) misadventures eventually results in the animals being shipped out to an animal preserve in Kenya. But more penguin shenanigans cause the crates with the four pals to wash up on the coast of Madagascar, — an island with little in common with Manhattan where the bulk of the film takes place.
 
  As quintessential New Yorkers, the animals have a comically tough time adapting to the wild, and they also have to deal with the island's other inhabitants: a tribe of wild and crazy lemurs, the original party animals. Head of the tribe is the self-important King Julien XIII, voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen. An actor best known as the inimitable Ali G, Baron Cohen nearly steals the picture with his unplaceable lemurese accent.
 
  Though things get a bit serious when Alex threatens to turn native, "Madagascar" keeps things loose and funny throughout. There are visual gags, musical jokes keyed to songs like "Stayin' Alive" and the "Hawaii Five-O" theme, and clever lines from screenwriters Mark Burton & Billy Frolick and Eric Darnell & Tom McGrath.
 
  If this film does have a moral, it's that no one should give up on their friends. Maybe that's not such a bad lesson after all.

Anarchy is the timeless spirit of animation. It's there in Bugs Bunny and Bullwinkle cartoons, in Fantasia  and The Incredibles . It's there as well, in a megaplex-toddler-friendly way, in Madagascar , the delightfully wacked new digitally animated comedy in which a quartet of critters escape the Central Park Zoo to taste the freedom of the wild world beyond. Freedom doesn't agree with them, exactly; it makes them prickle and sweat. Yet that's the film's funky glory. Madagascar , which opens with a chorus of penguins singing ''Born Free'' (fear not  it's a dream sequence), dishes up some very corny jokes, but the images have a brighter-than-life vivacity. The movie is so in love with craziness, with the infantile fun of What Comes Next, that it scarcely has time to worry about whether its heroes are being redeemed or not.
Directors Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath depict the Central Park Zoo in clean, crisp morning light, and from dramatic low angles, so that the skyscrapers of Manhattan are always looming in the background, rendering the zoo the grandest of sunstruck prisons. Alex the Lion, with his blow-dried pentagon of a mane, is voiced by Ben Stiller. In classic Stiller fashion, he's a polite and self-doubting egomaniac, at home in captivity, preening for adoring crowds like the domesticated muscleman of the jungle. His best friend, Marty the Zebra (Chris Rock), is a loyal, low-down neurotic who can't decide whether he's black with white stripes or vice versa. Marty, however, does know that he'd like to break away from behind bars. When he busts out of the zoo, Alex follows close behind, along with Melman the Giraffe (David Schwimmer), a nudnik hypochondriac, and Gloria the Hippo (Jada Pinkett Smith), a saucy scold.
For a while, they turn Manhattan into a gritty playground, but they end up cornered by police at Grand Central Terminal. Packed off in crates to a Kenyan wildlife reserve, they are shipwrecked on Madagascar, a tropical island that looks like Waikiki as drawn by Rousseau, and once there they meet the restless natives, a tribe of hard-partying lemurs whose self-proclaimed king, Julien, is the spirit  the very soul  of anarchy. Voiced by Sacha Baron Cohen, who is best known for his put-on alter ego, the brilliantly obtuse hip-hop interviewer Ali G, Julien is first seen leading a techno-disco horde as he sings, ''I like to moove-it! moove-it!'' I nominate that line as the single most demonically catchy in any movie this year. The song gets inside you like a cosmic goof, as Cohen voices Julien with an accent that's like 12 spices at once  he mixes rasta exuberance with a touch of Indian singsong with his own special brand of mishegoss defiance. He makes this lemur king, with his wavery grin and oversize yellow saucer eyes, happily insane.
The madness escalates from there, as the lemurs send their zoo visitors, whom they dub the New York Giants, to a special lush corner of the island that's like a wild-kingdom Eden. Alex begins to feel free, all right. His inner carnivore awakens; he starts to fantasize about eating his friends, who turn into steaks before his eyes. In the old Warner Bros. cartoons, stuff like this happened when stranded characters ran out of food, but you've got to hand it to a kiddie flick that dares to present its hero's follow-your-dream ''liberation'' as his looming conversion into a flesh-hungry sociopath. That's untamed fun.

adagascar," the new computer-animated picture from DreamWorks, is, at least in part, a movie about what a bad idea it is to leave New York City. Its main characters are four residents of the Central Park Zoo - a zebra, a hippo, a lion and a giraffe - who abandon their lives of comfortable, pampered confinement and wind up in that strange and confusing place known as "the wild." Of the four, only Marty, the zebra (voiced by Chris Rock), has any desire to make the trip. On his 10th birthday, in spite of a lovely party thrown by his friends, Marty finds himself in a midlife crisis, and decides to visit the open spaces and grassy savannahs of Connecticut (in whose woods, unbeknownst to him, a leopard once prowled in an older, better movie). Tagging along with a claque of hard-boiled penguins, who have been re-enacting "The Great Escape," Marty lights out for Grand Central Terminal, and his worried pals go after him, arriving at the station by subway in one of the movie's better sequences. Then, their departure misinterpreted as a result of unhappiness with the zoo, the lot of them are shipped off to a wildlife preserve in Kenya. Instead, by accident, they land on the island that gives the film its title - a place where, in real life, creatures like them are no more likely to be found than at the Central Park Zoo - as well as an excuse to fill the screen with adorable, big-eyed lemurs. The annoying sidekick is a longstanding feature of child-oriented animated entertainment. The chief innovation of "Madagascar" is that it consists entirely of annoying sidekicks, whose tics and quirks are not quite sufficient to make them interesting characters. Marty's best pal is the lion, a vain, talkative cat named Alex, who speaks in the rapid-fire, passive-aggressive voice of Ben Stiller. The giraffe, a hypochondriac named Melman, is played by David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinkett Smith is the hippo, a no-nonsense, talk-to-the-hand, big sisterly type named Gloria. Julien, the king of the lemurs (Sacha Baron Cohen, of "Da Ali G Show"), is perhaps the most annoying character of them all, with his strange, quasi-Caribbean accent and his slinky dance moves, and even he gets a sidekick of his own (Cedric the Entertainer). Add to this a score by Hans Zimmer,  and you may find yourself longing for the quiet and relaxation of a Midtown traffic jam. Like so many other animated features - "Robots" is another recent example - "Madagascar" spends all its imaginative resources on visual novelty while piecing its story together out of tired conventions and loud, obvious jokes. Some of the New York scenes are both witty and grand, fusing a romantic iconography of Manhattan with incongruous animal movements in a way that makes the city feel both wild and cozy, but once the animals leave town, the movie quickly runs out of ideas. One advantage to working with talking animals seems to be that they provide an excuse to indulge in scatological humor. Sometimes this is amusing, though the funniest example will surely sail over the heads of younger viewers: "Tom Wolfe is speaking tonight at Lincoln Center," says one sophisticated monkey to another. "Of course we're going to throw poo."  On the other hand, I'm not sure why the sight of a giraffe eating a deodorant cake from a urinal is supposed to be funny, unless I'm missing the point, and it's actually supposed to be realistic. Probably not, since the reality of life in the wild is something that this movie, like others of its kind, treats with anxious timidity. One of the apparent aims of "Madagascar" is to promote interspecies harmony as a metaphor for multicultural tolerance, a sweet enough idea complicated by the fact that perfectly nice animals often kill and eat one another. Alex, the citified lion, has evolved beyond such unpleasantness; at the zoo, his prey is delivered to him in the form of steaks, the cute and furry origins of which are discreetly suppressed. Out in the wild, though, his predatory nature reasserts itself, especially since part of Madagascar is inhabited by hyenalike creatures called fusa, which menace both the native lemurs and the visiting New Yorkers. Alex's regression provides the only suggestion of dramatic tension in the movie, which is otherwise smilingly innocuous, with an occasional gesture toward mild naughtiness. It has neither the wit and pathos of "Chicken Run" nor the emotional sweep and adventurous spirit of "Finding Nemo," though it limpingly follows them for a plot point or two. Instead, it condescends  to both its audience - who it figures will be satisfied with cuteness, flatulence, movie-star voices and bright colors - and to its characters, about whose lives and aspirations it could hardly care less. "Madagascar" arouses no sense of wonder, except insofar as you wonder, as you watch it, how so much talent, technical skill and money could add up to so little. "Madagascar" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has some crude humor and a few scary scenes.

DreamWorks' "Madagascar" is pleasant, if mediocre family fare. Tale of Gotham zoo critters unprepared for their sudden transfer to the wild will please parents looking for an alternative to the violence of "Star Wars." But despite voice contribs led by Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, there's not much here to capture the imagination of any but smaller fry. Without immediate competition for that target aud, pic should do good if unspectacular biz during early summer, with quick passage thereafter to a healthy home-format life. 
A rooftop Central Park Zoo is home to a motley animal crew tame enough to co-exist under the same roof. It's the 10th birthday of zebra Marty (Rock), prompting a celebration by his best pals -- hippo Gloria (Jada Pinkett Smith, channeling ghetto fabulousness), hypochondriac giraffe Melman (David Schwimmer) and lion Alex (Stiller), the star of their daily show featuring Marine World-type stunts.
Channeling jaded Manhattanites, the animals roll their eyes at Marty's birthday wish: to glimpse life in the wild, a world he's never experienced.
Somehow during the night, Marty sneaks off the premises. His panicked friends give chase, tracking him to Grand Central Station (he'd planned on taking the train to the wilds of Connecticut). But the general human havoc caused by the breakout pressures authorities to send the animals back to what the people believe is the critters' native habitat.
Waking up from sedation in separate shipping crates on a huge sea vessel, the foursome end up tumbling overboard, washing ashore on a tropical beach. They soon discover the local population -- a tribe of yellow-eyed, Ewok-y all-purpose mammals presided over by pompous King Julien (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his second-in-command Maurice (Cedric the Entertainer).
First glimpsed enjoying a sort of jungle rave, these herbivores have nary a care save one: the mongoose-like Foosa, a species whose eating habits include them on the menu. Little realizing just how non-threatening captivity has made the new visitors, the King hopes these "New York giants" can scare the predators off once and for all.
Meanwhile, the city critters are adjusting variably to life in paradise, spending most of their time blaming Marty and his wish for exiling them to this alien backwater where they actually have to feed themselves. It's a task that poses a particular problem for Alex, who lives on juicy steaks, and has never needed to know where they come from. Hunger awakens instinct, however, stirring the Jekyll beneath his cityfied Hyde.
Script's most interesting development thus arrives rather late, as Alex fights the rising compulsion to dine on his closest friends.
This conflict and the Foosa menace are dealt with in a decent climax, followed by a nondescript fade under the smooth guidance of co-helmers Eric Darnell ("Antz") and Tom McGrath ("Ren and Stimpy Show").
Pic's hour and a half pass painlessly, but leave few lasting impressions. Character designs are cute (especially Alex, who will make a great plush toy). Voice turns are recognizable but not very inventive.Backgrounds are colorful, lush in the jungle scenes, but there's no fresh look stamping pic as a uniquely conceived project. Rather it's generically (and skillfully) assembled.
Like the studio's "Shark Tale" and "Shrek 2" last year, "Madagascar" aims to keep the grown-ups entertained mostly through movie in-jokes, especially with excerpted musical themes (from "Born Free," "Hawaii Five-O," "Chariots of Fire," etc.). Viewers under 10 or so will find the emphasis on slapstick satisfying. Good running-gag involves a pack of plotting penguins who act like an elite espionage corps.
Pic has no original songs; closest thing to a production number is when the island populace gets jiggy to Reel2Reel's "I Like to Move It, Move It." Hans Zimmer's clock-punching background score is par for a movie whose tech and creative contributions are polished but unremarkable.
One spelled-out "hell" and one spoken "sucks" (as well as forcing the kiddies to confront the dynamics of the food chain) presumably account for the PG rating.

A modest, fast, and relatively painless all-digital cartoon, the new DreamWorks  money milker belongs to what is now a time- and profit-petrified tradition: the prepubescent kids' movie polluted by (a) middle-school-level fart jokes and (b) pointless allusions to decades-old pop culture only adults will comprehend, if not appreciate. But Madagascar  's bathroom cracks are minor, its soundtrack throwbacks (Saturday Night Fever , Born Free , Chariots of Fire ) tired but innocuous. In fact, the film is so unassuming the promotional blitzkrieg that's preceded it seems to have more authorityand it probably cost more. All of which registers on the upside; compared to the vulgar post-Pixar  gastritis that plagued Antz , Shrek  , Shrek 2 , and Shark Tale , Madagascar  is an antic little charmer, wasting no more or less time on repetitive pratfalls and unpoetic mushiness than any Disney  film since 1948.
It doesn't hurt that the first third is set in a sweetheart re-envisioning of the Central Park Zoo , where complacent beasts repose (superstar lion Ben Stiller , hypochondriac giraffe David Schwimmer , sassy hippo Jada Pinkett-Smith ). Discontented zebra Chris Rock  longs for "the wild," however, and his daydreams are ignited by a quartet of P.O.W. penguins who are tunneling their way to freedom. The stars are vocally dull or, in the case of Rock, grating and unvaried, but the New Yawkismsincluding a police horse with a Canarsie  grunt and the inevitable sight of a runaway zebra going virtually unnoticed on Lexington Avenueare hard to resist. Too soon, the animals are apprehended in Grand Central Terminal  and shipped overseas, where they crash-land on a tropical beach and confront the tension between their indulged home life and their natural selves.
"Confront" may be a weighty word to use; Madagascar  turns in its last act toward addressing the return of instinct and the odd predator-prey friendships that populate the film, but it's hardly dramatic. At least the characters have an angular, freehand design to them, not the lumpy faux-waxworks style that dominated the Shrek s. The film's best idea is an island nation of hopping, hip-swiveling, billiard-ball-eyed lemurs, led by hyperactive king Sacha Baron Cohen , with a mercurial Middle Eastern accent and a delivery like a machine gun shooting Ping-Pong balls. Drafted and animated to resemble E-stoked clubbers bouncing to a remix of "I Like to Move It," their rainbow-colored corneas huge and shining in giddy rapture, the lemurs are enough of a comic wonder to render the other characters obsolete. A few other toss-off gags workedmy favorite was a glimpse of the lemurs' court stenographer, a fat chameleon who strikes from the record with his tongueand Madagascar 's relaxed density is a relief given the DreamWorks tendency to overbear, overblast, and overcaricaturize. Even as the references fall flat and the story plods, it's obvious the animation crew for the supporting creaturesincluding an unlucky duckling and a Mogwai  bush babyhad the most fun.
