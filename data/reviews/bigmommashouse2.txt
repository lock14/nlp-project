         Taking in the bulbous, dimpled totality of Martin Lawrence's plus-size get-up in "Big Momma's House 2" — whether in a high-riding one-piece bathing suit or the customary flower print dress — it's not hard to marvel at the advances in drag technology since Fatty Arbuckle, "Some Like It Hot" and Monty Python. This isn't your father's cross-dressing. At the same time, the science of comedy attains a new level of appreciation, since hardly anything about this sluggish sequel to the 2000 box office hit comes close to being funny.
 
  The premise puts Big Momma — a.k.a. FBI agent Malcolm Turner, now an expectant father married to Nia Long's character from the first film — as an undercover nanny in the Orange County home of a suspicious computer-worm creator (Mark Moses), his high-strung wife (Emily Procter) and their neglected kids.
 


         






    Naturally, saving the day includes fixing a dysfunctional household: think "The Pacifier" with gags about oversize thongs, or "Bringing Down the House" starring a latex-and-foam-enhanced (and considerably less attractive) Queen Latifah.
 
  Ultimately, though, the family film vibe doesn't suit a manic-tempered comic such as Lawrence, whose fat suit and septuagenarian makeup can't hide his obvious boredom in delivering more of the same wheezing insults and down-home advice.   

It's taken Martin Lawrence six years to resurrect Hattie Mae Pierce, the zaftig alter ego of FBI agent Malcolm Turner who again goes undercover  this time as a nanny spying on Tom Fuller (Desperate Housewives ' Mark Moses), a father of three who's created a computer worm that could threaten homeland security. That flimsy plot is the one nod to timeliness in Big Momma's House 2 ; otherwise, this unnecessary but genial comedy's yuks are firmly steeped in the ways of Y2K. An adorable Chihuahua that looks like it wandered in from the set of an old Taco Bell commercial gets drunk on tequila. Momma chases a perp along an ocean boardwalk before hopping onto a Segway. And the final scenes, in a pale imitation of 2000's already-too-satirized Bring It On , take place at a tween cheer competition. What, you were expecting originality from a Martin Lawrence sequel? House 2  may never elicit more than mild chuckles, but when Momma teaches the Fullers a few lessons about family, it's heartfelt without being syrupy. And Lawrence  thundering down the beach in cornrows and a yellow swimsuit  yet again proves that there is no such thing as an unfunny 10 parody.


More than five years after "Big Momma's House" -- which was basically "Kindergarten Cop" in drag -- Martin Lawrence goes the Uncle Miltie route again in this wholly uninspired sequel, which plays more like "Mrs. Doubtfire 2." Donning the fat suit and wig, Lawrence's FBI agent becomes the nanny to a trio of kids, while engaging in the most rudimentary of revenge plots. Probably review-proof for openers, pic is so episodic and flat it should be a letdown even to those amused by the original.
Consider it a trivia footnote that the first "House" party featured Terrence Howard as the bad guy and Paul Giamatti as Lawrence's partner. Yet if that stakeout caper actually had some semblance of a dramatic foundation, the setup here is ludicrous from the get-go, as if the box office tally from its forerunner was reason enough to make the sequel.
Lawrence's Agent Malcolm Turner has wedded the woman he met in the first film, Sherrie (Nia Long), and transferred to a desk job as they await the birth of their child. When one of his mentors is killed, however, Malcolm fabricates an excuse to go undercover as Big Momma, becoming the nanny to a businessman, Tom Fuller ("Desperate Housewives'�" Mark Moses), suspected in the case.
Fuller is pretty much an absentee dad, and his wife Leah ("CSI: Miami's" Emily Procter) demands order to the point of absurdity -- one of those overeager moms determined to fast-track her kids to the Ivy League without exhibiting any warmth toward them. So it's up to Big Momma to set everyone straight, while simultaneously ferreting out a national security threat, fending off disapproving FBI superiors and evading detection by his wife, who begins to doubt that Malcolm's on a business trip.
If that sounds busy, it's amazing how tedious the movie feels, perhaps because veteran sitcom director John Whitesell presents it less as a feature than a loosely connected series of scenes divided by musicvideos. As a result, even most of the set pieces -- including Lawrence, in Big Momma disguise, accompanying Leah to a ritzy spa filled with half-naked Victoria's Secret models -- play better in 30-second TV ads than in the theater.
Given that his energy has to carry the action, Lawrence actually seems kind of bored except when Big Momma gets to cut loose on the dance floor to teach one of the moppets to be a cheerleader. As for the rest of the cast, it's hard to avoid thinking that a lot of talented TV regulars picked up checks during their hiatus periods, and little else.
As constructed by Whitesell and writer Don Rhymer (who shared credit on the earlier movie), the tone also oscillates between overly broad and cloying, as George S. Clinton's musical cues work overtime signaling the shifts.
The movie even lacks any of the big bathroom gags that provided guilty laughs the first time around. The only funny bits, rather, involve the Fullers' 3-year-old son constantly leaping off things (to splat on the ground below) and the depressed family Chihuahua watching telenovelas.
No one confuses comedy sequels with "Masterpiece Theater," but "Big Momma's" exhibits such a minimal effort made to justify a reprise that the assumption appears to be that cloaking Lawrence in Greg Cannom's suit will alone be ample incentive for audiences to flock back.
The producers maintain in the press notes that ensuring the sequel measured up to its predecessor prompted the five-year delay. According to that standard, "Big Momma 3" could be made at any time -- but there's no need to rush.

Freshly feted on Inside the Actors Studio  , Martin Lawrence  has entrenched himself in the mushy middle of the comedy fundament, joining Steve Martin  and Eddie Murphy  in pumping out inoffensive family comedies that rake in cash. On the heels of Martin's Cheaper by the Dozen 2 , Lawrence unveils Big Momma's House 2 , which turns out to be as warmhearted as the original. The film zooms past the plot contortions needed to get him back in- to the fat suit, plopping Lawrence's cross-dressing FBI agent  down as a nanny for a white-collar family, whose father is selling intelligence to the axis of evil. With a freedom the NSA  would envy, Big Momma breaks into his home and work offices while still having time to teach the kids how to shake dat ass. Lawrence is an ingratiating performer, sarcastic and sentimental, and does inventive work with a swivel chair, a bathing suit, and steaming rocks. He's helped along by Emily Procter , who plays the overworked wife and should be freed from CSI: Miami   as soon as possible.
