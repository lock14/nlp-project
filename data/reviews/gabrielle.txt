Although the kinds of women she plays often appear armored and implacable (even while punishing themselves for their own desires), Isabelle Huppert is stripped psychologically bare in Gabrielle , Patrice Chéreau's dreamlike interpretation of Joseph Conrad's short story ''The Return.'' Working with costar Pascal Greggory (Queen Margot ), Huppert conveys the awakening of a turn-of-the-century society wife whose crime isn't in leaving her husband, but in changing her mind after she's left. The swirl of Eric Gautier's cinematography sometimes overtakes the convolutions of the script. But Greggory anchors Gabrielle in manly bewilderment and rage, while Huppert claws the title character's way to self-awareness.

 In “Gabrielle,” a film of eccentric beauty and wild feeling, printed words sometimes fill the screen, almost obliterating the puny creatures struggling beneath the  type. Directed by the consistently inventive Patrice Chéreau, a French filmmaker perhaps best known in  the United States for the historical pageant “Queen Margot” and better remembered for “Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train,” this startling drama recounts the dissolution of a marriage of a couple from the haute bourgeoisie, Jean and Gabrielle Hervey, played by the supremely well-matched Pascal Greggory  and Isabelle Huppert.  Based on Joseph Conrad’s very dry, very vicious long short story, “The Return,” the film concerns a man (Alvan in the original) who, having married a woman for whom he apparently feels nothing, becomes undone when she leaves him for another. Conrad narrates the story  in a claustrophobic   third-person voice  that immerses us fully in the husband’s point of view while simultaneously allowing us to see the woman hovering at the periphery. Working with the screenwriter Anne-Louise Trividic,  as he did with two of his finer efforts, “Intimacy” and “His Brother,”  Mr. Chéreau opens the story up, dividing it more equally between the characters but without compromising Conrad’s meaning or emotional brutality.  Mr. Chéreau sets the story in Paris around 1912 (the original, written around 1897, comes without any such place or time markers), two years before the war that will violently sweep away the last vestiges of the 19th century. Madame and monsieur, childless and sometime past their fertile prime, live in a mansion filled with the kind of luxurious trappings — allegorical paintings and gleaming white statues of women frozen in classical poses — that give such homes the chill of a mausoleum. A fleet of maids, impeccably dressed in matching black and white, keep the crypt running; every Thursday an army of  bohemians invades, providing amusement and social cachet, and filling the air with chatter and smoke.  For Jean, whose fastidious swoop of hair telegraphs his vanity long before his words do, the maids and the bohemians, the statues and the wife are interchangeable.  Each has been bought, paid for and arranged in a consciousness as carefully ordered as the mansion’s great rooms. Uninteresting in and of themselves, they exist only to advance his position, so much so that when he thinks of his wife and his guests while strolling  one day, it’s as if he were itemizing the contents of a safe. And yet, when his most prized possession goes missing, having left a farewell letter propped up on  a dressing table,   the blow hits Jean with unexpected force, prying him from his facade  like a snail from its shell.  As Mr. Chéreau fluidly moves back and forth in time, using different color  schemes  and editing rhythms to express what the characters themselves cannot always say,  he  forces air  into a story that  in the writing and the subject can feel moribund on the page. Although you wouldn’t know it to look at most of his films, he has a long history directing  for  theater and  opera, experience that he has mostly used to his advantage in his work for the cinema. His theater background may help account for the consistently fine acting in his films, while his  staging of Wagner  may explain the wonderful fearlessness with which he embraces melodramatic excess.  Here,  Mr. Chéreau pushes his characters to the limits of emotion, turning  Gabrielle’s face various shades of pink and forcing Jean’s swoop of hair to tumble. Ms. Huppert, one of the screen’s great criers (second only to Juliette Binoche), spends much of  the film  with a flush  and damp face, suffering in sepulchral silence while Mr.  Greggory brilliantly rages. Both actors keep you riveted, even when Mr. Chéreau blows up passages from Conrad’s text, cutting away entirely from the performers (making you all the more anxious for their return) or obscuring their images with a well-chosen word (“Stay!”). Together with his extraordinary performers, Mr. Chéreau breathes  life into characters who long ago set a course for death.

Patrice Chereau's twin careers as legit and movie director bisect to often memorable, though not always comfortable, effect in costume drama "Gabrielle," a stylized examination of a suddenly imploded marriage. Theatrical in its language and staging, but cinematic in its use of widescreen and visual effects, pic could be titled "Prelude and Seven Scenes from a Bust-Up." Chereau's name, and that of Isabelle Huppert as the bruised wife, will give this some profile at fests, but this talky, rigorous, sometimes chancy film will face tough sledding on the arthouse circuit. Pic split crix at its Venice preem.
Script by Chereau and Anne-Louise Trividic, who previously worked together on helmer's "Intimacy" (2001) and "His Brother" (2003), is based on Joseph Conrad's 40-page short story, written from the perspective of the husband and with only a handful of lines given to the wife. Chereau and Trividic have attempted to make the wife a full partner in the drama --and even named the film after her -- cloning a complete human being from Conrad's scraps of DNA.
Problem is that the gambit doesn't quite work, despite poised playing by Huppert that, in many respects, is superior to Pascal Greggory's as the husband. Where the husband's dialogue feels well-rounded, the wife's feels tentative -- and doesn't answer key questions like why she returns at the start and what she ever saw in the husband in the first place.
With Greggory playing a cold, arrogant control-freak, pic's emotional center should be Huppert's character. But there's not enough to her to hold on to, let alone empathize with.
Starting in B&W, as well-off writer-politico Jean Hervey (Greggory) walks home for dinner and introduces himself in V.O., film dissolves into color for a lavish dinner party (intro'ed by the caption "last Thursday") that functions as a kind of prelude. It's Paris society just prior to WWI and, as the camera catches characters from the Herveys' social circle, Jean tells the audience how much he admires his smart, socially gifted wife, Gabrielle (Huppert), and how well he knows her.
Well, obviously not that well. As the story proper begins, and Jean enters his home, still rhapsodizing about Gabrielle and their first meeting, he (and his pompous V.O.) are brought to a stop by the sight of a letter on a table. As Jean realizes it's a Dear John, his whole demeanor falls to pieces.
Unlike the lensing of the Belle Epoque prelude -- golds, reds, blacks, like Proust sprung to life -- the colors for home life with the Herveys are cold and umbrous, closer to those for "Intimacy." Then, out of the shadows, appears Gabrielle herself, like a grieving widow, and explains her leaving was "a mistake." Jean, his pride partly restored, upbraids her for humiliating him, and generally treats her like an errant child, finishing with a condescending "I forgive you."
Subsequent scenes are basically variations on that material, with Gabrielle sometimes dominating the drama -- as in a long invented scene with her personal maid -- and extra information occasionally dropped into the bubbling pot. Gabrielle's revelation, halfway through the movie, of who her lover is throws Jean off balance, leading to her frank dissection of their marriage that leaves him metaphorically drawn and quartered.
Unlike in, say, Ingmar Bergman's "Scenes From a Marriage," this is all done in a highly stylized way, with dialogue that's consciously literary and very French-metaphysical. There's much talk of control, loving or not loving, and so on.
Though it won't appeal to everyone, the concoction actually works, thanks to Huppert and Greggory's powerful negative chemistry. Add to that Eric Gautier's suffused lighting and gliding widescreen camerawork that support the theatricality of the dialogue while reminding viewers (through occasional use of onscreen graphics and visual F/X) that they're still watching a movie. Think of a late Visconti movie, like "Conversation Piece," but with much more edge.
Even when the gab starts to pall, Chereau never lets the audience forget that, first and foremost, he is a master stager. A section near the end, as the housemaids carrying lamps through the dark corridors, to Fabio Vacchi's doleful music, is like a symphonic interlude in a dark romantic opera, prepping the viewer for the final showdown.

Joseph Conrad 's short story "The Return" (written in 1897 but not published until 1923) is a domestic-bourgeois detonation that finds the author far from his exotic stomping grounds. But for Conrad, an outsider in London, there were surely few settings more alien than English high society; accordingly, this relatively unsung, somewhat Jamesian piece unfolds with the simultaneous vividness and detachment of an out-of-body hallucination. Patrice Chéreau 's adaptationrelocated to turn-of-the-century Paris and retitled Gabrielle is as compact and precise as the Conrad original, and a stunning reinvention of the period chamber drama.
The film opens, in black-and-white, with the scintillating promise of a Lumiére documentary. A train pulls into a station, a crowd alights, and we home in one man. His stride is confident, his voiceover imperious and dreamily self-satisfied: Jean (Pascal Greggory ), a successful publisher, is acutely aware of and deeply pleased with his high social standing, fine taste, and abundant material possessions, among which he seems to include his wife, Gabrielle (Isabelle Huppert ). But in a single afternoon, during which Gabrielle leaves him for another man then abruptly reverses her decision, everything that Jean believes he knows about his marriage and his life falls apart.
It begins with a lettera propulsively described passage in the story and an explosive one in the movie. When Jean spies the fateful missive, Chéreau illustrates the initial jolt as a pulse-quickening blur of confusion, irritation, and dread, in a roomful of mirrors and with a battery of words on the screen. Chéreau deploys intertitles throughouta curious affectation that confers a spectral, antique quality on the proceedings but also has a perversely bracing, almost Pop Art effect. When it comes to this assaultive letter (an "absurd and distracting tumult seemed to ooze out of the written words," per Conrad) and the head-spinning three-word sentence that ends the story, the assertive bursts of text land emotional blows that filmed action alone somehow would not.
Since 1999's Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train  (his first collaboration with the great cinematographer Eric Gautier ), Chéreau has emerged as a daredevil stylist. His movies reach for an operatic pitch and are often characterized by a wild abandon and hectic physicality. (Conrad himself called "The Return" a collection of "physical impressions: impressions of sound and sight.") As befits a microscopic study of a relationship that shifts moment to moment, Gabrielle  crackles with electric urgency. Chéreau keeps things off-balance by switching, sometimes for no discernible reason, between color and black-and-white; Gautier's fleet, responsive camerawork here constitutes a master class in lighting and shooting faces and interiors in CinemaScope.
The main challenge confronting Chéreau is how to dramatize an epiphany, especially one as complex and unpredictable as Jean experiences. That he succeeds is testament to his phenomenal leads, who deliver easily two of the year's best performances, as psychologically intricate as they are palpably intense. Like "The Return," Gabrielle  monitors the husband's minutely shaded reaction to his wife's outbreak of passionfrom bafflement and humiliation to a terrified comprehension. Conrad, however, left the wife a nameless ciphershe first appears (in both story and movie) behind a veil. Having given her a name, titled his film for her, and enlisted the fearless Huppert to embody her, Chéreau obviously intends to redress the balance. In this domestic battle, played out amid silently bustling servants and stiffly poised dinner guests, the wife's reproachful, wounding silences cut deeper than the husband's stunned, wounded outbursts. The contorted recriminations build to an astonishing scene in which Jean storms into Gabrielle's bedroom and mounts her, in a ridiculous, mortifying attempt to resuscitate their moribund marriage.
Almost the entire film unfolds within the unhappy couple's home, an ornate, sumptuously upholstered expanse lit to suggest a mausoleum. Gabrielle  makes apparent what was quietly ominous in Conrad's storythat the unfaithful wife's return is a sort of haunting. At once robust and ethereal, this is an existential ghost story, with fresh blood pulsing through its veins.
