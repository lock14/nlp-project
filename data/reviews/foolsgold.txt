Fool�s Gold
 begins with an ending. In sun-baked Key West, Fla., where even people with taste delight at the sound of steel drums, Tess (Hudson) sits grumbling in a divorce hearing with her lawyer and her husband�s lawyer and a presiding judge. All that�s missing is her husband. This is typical: Finn (McConaughey) is a perpetual dreamer, with no car, no money, no sense of responsibility, and no idea how to act like an adult. Just then, as if by magic, our Peter Pan comes running into the office, all sun-streaked hair, white teeth, and beach-bum charm, and I realized that all of Tess� protestations were unnecessary: Surely, wearing a tie-dyed T-shirt in public is justification enough for divorce in any judge�s court. Even, perhaps, a little jail time. Fool�s Gold
 is the latest romantic comedy from Tennant, who is very possibly the worst director working in Hollywood today. Fools Rush In
. Ever After
. Sweet Home Alabama
. Hitch
. I ask you: Has anyone done more in the last 10 years to make love seem totally unappetizing? Well, Tennant fans will be happy to know his streak remains unblemished with Fool�s Gold
, the surprisingly convoluted tale of two gorgeous, love-tossed, star-crossed treasure hunters who reunite to search for a long-missing 18th century galleon that was carrying an enormous fortune to Spain as part of Prince Philip�s dowry for his new bride when it was waylaid and sunk during a hurricane off the coast of Havana and was then saved by an enterprising ship captain�s son who lied to passing sailors about how he came to be shipwrecked on a deserted island and who preserved his secret through the use of cleverly laid clues and mysteries that would one day be solved by two gorgeous, love-tossed, star-crossed treasure hunters. Got that? Add in a hip-hop loan shark with a mean streak, a calypso soundtrack that�s better suited to a cruise-line commercial, and Sutherland employing a British accent that makes him sound like he�s speaking with a mouthful of pudding, and you have a movie that manages to be everything � romantic comedy, adventure film, family melodrama, farce, gangster movie, and history lesson � and absolutely nothing all at once. I won�t even get started on McConaughey, who, if I remember correctly, was once considered an actor, or Hudson, who wasn�t; I didn�t expect anything from them. But Bremner (Trainspotting
) and Winstone (Nil by Mouth
) should be ashamed of themselves: Considering the state of the dollar these days, they probably could have earned more making this kind of garbage back in Britain. If you�re going to sell out, at least read the financial pages before you do it.


"Fool's Gold" is a tedious adventure-romance about a himbo treasure hunter, Finn (Matthew McConaughey), his soon-to-be-ex wife, Tess (Kate Hudson), and the hundreds of millions of dollars in coins and jewels they stop squabbling long enough to find. It's "National Treasure," the Kathleen Turner-Michael Douglas edition.
When I was bored watching it (which is to say often) I thought about admiring the hard work McConaughey did for this picture and how all that work appears to have gone into his abs. He's shirtless 70 percent of the movie, and that's not quite the arousing dream it ought to be - mostly because McConaughey is more or less saying, "I'm an arousing dream!"
On their treasure hunt, Finn and Tess manage to rope in Donald Sutherland as Nigel Honeycutt, a rich Englishman whose silky white mane of hair could double as a slip or an ascot. Tess works on his boat, which his dim American socialite daughter (Alexis Dziena) is visiting. She's a ropy creature whose next career could be as a plumber's snake. (To Dziena's credit, she's often the most charismatic person in the movie.)
Nigel's boat winds up rescuing Finn from drowning - to Tess's annoyance - and what adventure there is begins. These four are racing to find the treasure against both the gangsta (Kevin Hart) who wants the money Finn owes him and a grizzled boat captain (Ray Winstone, complete with Southern pirate accent).
Director Andy Tennant has been taking stabs at film romance for years ("Fools Rush In," "Ever After," "Sweet Home Alabama," "Hitch"). But all he shows us are the puncture wounds. Here he gets script credit along with John Claflin and Daniel Zelman, and the movie lazily drags along, failing to realize even its basest screwball potential. The zing between Hudson and McConaughey, which was more or less there in "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," goes un-zung.
"Fool's Gold" plays like a product that began life as one thing in the Hollywood cannery and wound up something else. It's full of plastic sentiment, chases, buffoonery, and dull lewdness, not to mention the macho gay couple stuck cooking the meals on Nigel's boat. Seventy years ago they would have been platonic black dudes. Sometimes progress stinks.
Hudson no longer seems to care that she hasn't come close to discovering how good she could be in movies. Instead, she spends a lot of screen time pointing out who in "Fool's Gold" is dumb and who's dumber. (She never gets around to the composer whose brass-and-steel drum score says "Weekend at Bernie's 5.") Of course, if Hudson were so smart she wouldn't be here, floating around a movie that makes the most beautiful waters seem like they've been colored with 2000 Flushes.

The words ''bad romantic comedy'' may now add up to a redundant phrase, but bad  is still a relative concept. I had fun at Miss Congeniality, Music and Lyrics,   and at parts of last year's The Heartbreak Kid . Does that make them good movies, or me an easy connoisseur of bad ones? Let's just say that enjoyment, even trashy enjoyment, is not to be sneered at. Boredom, on the other hand, is  and that's the real crime committed by the dead-in-the-water Fool's Gold  and the cold-as-last-year's-catchphrase The Hottie & the Nottie   , comedies that have all the zing of a gossip item you don't want to bother reading to the end.
Fool's Gold  is the sort of knockabout ''romp'' in which folks clunk each other over the head with shovels. It's the dialogue, though, that clunks most painfully. Matthew McConaughey plays some sort of ne'er-do-well man-child treasure hunter, and from the moment he finds a broken heirloom dinner plate while diving off Key West, hearing him ramble on  and on  about how this relic is going to lead him to the legendary Queen's Dowry treasure chests makes you wish you were listening to a forum on the erotics of tax policy. It's normally a measurement of star wattage when an actor beams through the dreck around him, but McConaughey's relentless, monkey-dimpled good cheer isn't contagious  it's annoyingly impervious. You could put this guy on the deck of the Titanic  10 minutes after it hit the iceberg, and he'd still be looking on the bright side, cracking wise, high on his ''Ya know ya cain't resist me!''  cornpone-beefcake charm.
As McConaughey's ex-wife, lured back by his sexy adventurer's spirit (the flip side of his flaky refusal to grow up), Kate Hudson is as blah and dazed as her costar is cloyingly enthused. If it's possible to have too even a tan, Hudson in Fool's Gold  would be the poster child for it. Her bronze glaze stiffens her, hardening the sparkle in her face. She goes through the motions of vivacity, but she seems to have forgotten that she's a star, and so do we. Fool's Gold  makes you long for the half-baked amusement of How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days , in which the same pair's peppy hostility was less canned than the contraption it powered.

 In “Fool’s Gold” Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey, as golden as a pair of rotisserie chickens, squabble and cavort in a tropical paradise. How nice for them, and for those in the audience who want nothing more from a midwinter trip to the movies than to gaze upon the tawny limbs and perfect bellybuttons of the stars.  Not that there isn’t a lot of other stuff going on in “Fool’s Gold,” a hectic action-romance-comedy directed by Andy Tennant from a script credited to him, John Claflin and Daniel Zelman. There is Alexis Dziena’s bellybutton, for instance, winking in solidarity (and perhaps  in friendly competition) with Ms. Hudson’s. And if plot is what you want, there is plenty of incident, including underwater fights and high-speed shenanigans involving motor scooters, Jet Skis and prop planes.  There is also quite a crowd of stock supporting characters. I suppose the filmmakers can claim some originality in assembling, within a single movie, a rich old guy in an ascot (Donald Sutherland), a crusty boat captain (Ray Winstone) and a murderous, greedy rap star (Kevin Hart), along with a loving, sharp-tongued gay couple and a pair of hapless criminal minions.  If only this hodgepodge offered more fun and less of the kind of frantic creative desperation that tries to pass itself off as giddy comic exuberance. Mr. McConaughey and Ms. Hudson, who were less than electrifying in “How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days,” appear to be suffering through a class in remedial chemistry, which they barely pass. Their characters, Finn and Tess, are on the verge of divorce.  Finn is a feckless treasure hunter whose irresponsible ways have finally driven Tess, even though she still  loves him, to dump him and return  to graduate school. First, however, she finds work on a yacht belonging to Nigel Honeycutt (Mr. Sutherland), whose jet-setting daughter, Gemma (Ms. Dziena), drops in for some text messaging and bikini modeling.  For a time “Fool’s Gold” holds out a vague promise of romantic farce, since it seems possible that either Gemma or her dad, or perhaps both, might become an obstacle to Tess and Finn’s inevitable reconciliation. Instead the film  stages a melodrama of father-daughter estrangement between Nigel and Gemma and abruptly shelves the dumb bimbo jokes, though not the leering camerawork aimed at Ms. Dziena.  And so the prospect of fireworks between Finn and Tess is quickly dampened, and the movie turns into a dull, noisy pursuit of old Spanish coins, aided by maps and letters and enough pseudohistorical explanation to round out the next episode in the “National Treasure” franchise.  Will Finn and Tess find the treasure before the bad guys? Will they put aside their differences and rekindle their love? Yes to both questions! I haven’t spoiled anything, by the way. But perhaps I’ve saved you some trouble.  “Fool’s Gold” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some violence and sexual situations.

The lure of Matthew McConaughey shirtless for extended stretches doubtless has some marketing value, but after that, "Fool's Gold" offers small compensation -- a listless romantic comedy that, almost out of desperation, turns a little more violent than necessary near the end. Treasure hunting has certainly worked for the "National Treasure" franchise," and an earlier McConaughey-Kate Hudson pairing enjoyed some success. Still, after however many doubloons can be hauled up from the utterly review-proof, it's hard to envision Warner Bros. separating too many fools from their money.
Reuniting the stars of "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days" in a more adventurous setting surely sounded promising, but in the hands of "Hitch" director Andy Tennant and his screenwriting collaborators Daniel Zelman and John Claflin, they find themselves up the proverbial creek without a paddle.
At times the pic feels like a comedic version of "The Deep," only without the comedy. McConaughey plays treasure seeker Finn, obsessed with a Spanish galleon loaded with treasure lost off the Florida coast (as played here by Australia) in 1715. His frenzied pursuit of said riches has cost him his wife, Tess (Hudson), who is divorcing Finn for having "no clue how to behave like a responsible adult."
It's just then, naturally, that Finn actually finds a clue pointing toward the treasure, which he's chasing with the patronage of a wealthy rapper-thug unfortunately named Bigg Bunny (comic Kevin Hart, put to very poor use).
Tess, meanwhile, has taken a job aboard a luxury yacht, working for the wealthy Nigel Honeycutt (Donald Sutherland, channeling Ronald Colman). After some finagling by Finn, Nigel agrees to finance an expedition for the loot mostly as a way to entertain his visiting daughter Gemma (Alexis Dziena, of ABC's "Invasion"), a pampered heiress and complete airhead.
Aside from the central couple's painfully flat banter and bickering, the movie's only real recurring gag is that Finn keeps getting whacked in the head with blunt instruments -- yielding wounds, not to be a stickler about continuity, that magically heal as if he were "X-Men's" Wolverine.
Ray Winstone also pops up as a rival treasure hunter and Finn's former mentor, but this subplot is so underdeveloped as to foster suspicions that sequences were left on the cutting-room floor -- hard as that is to believe, given the sluggish pace.
When the action does pick up near the climax, it's too late to redeem what's already transpired and a bit grittier than it should be tonally, as if we've detoured into a different movie. Nor is the missing-treasure riddle intriguing enough to sustain interest, though beyond the fauna displayed, the well-shot tropical scenery might be a balm to some, coming as it does in the dead of winter.
The point, clearly, is for Finn to woo Tess back along their shared journey, but despite the script's contrivances, there's not much chemistry between them. Indeed, the only real energy comes from Dziena's bubbly dim-bulb. Granted, that's a rather tired image, but as Finn demonstrates during one skirmish with Bunny's henchmen, a drowning man -- or even just one dispatched on a "Fool's" errand -- can't be too choosy when grasping for lifelines.

When a friend recently told me that she'd been confused by the poster for the Matthew McConaughey Kate Hudson  fortune-hunting romp, Fool's Gold ,  adorning her local multiplexthat she'd thought for sure this movie had already come and goneI understood her bewilderment. Even as a professional film critic trained in such nigh-impossible matters of deduction, I myself was stymied upon first encounter with the image of our two burnt-sienna stars standing thigh-high in aquamarine waters: Was this really a new movie, or just some infernal clip reel cut together from that McConaughey-centric Indiana Jones knockoff (Sahara ), that rom-com where Hudson fell for some shaggy overgrown slacker against her better judgment (You, Me and Dupree ), and that movie where Hudson previously fell for McConaughey (How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days )?
Well, Fool's Gold  is, generously speaking, an "original," though even screenwriters John Claflin  and Daniel Zelman  (who share credit with the director, Andy Tennant ) have borrowed more than a bit from their own previous tropical treasure hunt, the 2004 schlock-horror sequel Anacondas: The Hunt for the Blood Orchid . And here's the rub: Anacondas was a lot more fun.
Fool's Gold is the sort of movie that makes you look more kindly upon the WGA strike. It isn't merely badit's so desperate that the actors can scarcely conceal their contempt for the material. You hear it in their voices, particularly those of the supporting actors, who don't even try to keep up the ridiculous accents they've been asked to don: Canadian Donald Sutherland  as a British billionaire; Scotsman Ewen Bremner  as McConaughey's Ukrainian sidekick; Brit Ray Winstone  as McConaughey's Southern-twanged rival; and erstwhile Cosby kid Malcolm Jamal-Warner  as a gangsta rapper's Rastafarian henchman. Even McConaughey himself doesn't seem to be having a particularly good time, despite being cast rather close to the fun-loving, nude-bongo-drumming Adonis he plays regularly in the paparazzi spreads of People , Us Weekly  , et al. Sure, he puts on his best shit-eating grin as his Ben "Finn" Finnegan sprints half-naked through the streets of Key West  (don't ask) en route to his own divorce proceedings, or gets blown sky-high out of the ocean by a competitor's depth charge. But even that clownish brio does little to abate the movie's air of humid joylessness. Simply put, there's something depressing about watching a fortysomething refugee from a Jimmy Buffett  concert spend two full hours of screen time trying to get rich quick. Maybe, when all is said and done, McConaughey has been cast a little too close to home.
Movies about soldiers of fortune seeking the sunken dowry of an 18th-century Spanish queen are at least supposed to deliver a minimal level of Saturday-morning-serial derring-do, but the spectacle of McConaughey and Hudson (cast as Finn's long-suffering, newly-ex wife) lolling their way through Fool's Gold is so inert that it gives you a new appreciation for the uncomplicated pleasures of Into the Blue , or After the Sunset ,  or National Treasure 2 . (Hell, the 1980s Sharon Stone Richard Chamberlain  cheapie Allan Quatermain  and the Lost City of Gold  is starting to look pretty appealing right about now.) In those movies, at least, you had the sense that the characters were in this for the thrill of the hunt, or for the sake of historical preservation, or something  other than cold, hard cash. But for all its convoluted backstory and blather about "holding history in your own two hands," Fool's Gold is as monomaniacally about greed as another recent film on the subject, minus the enveloping gravitas (and, well, just about everything else): It's There Will Be Blood in bikinis and board shorts.
Watching a movie this life-sucking, you start to scour the surroundings for something anythingto hold your interest. The endless gag lines (in every sense) about McConaughey's supposed sexual prowess? No, thanks. The swishy gay chef character who says things like, "There's something wrong with my bisque"? Um, pass. The attractive curvilinear molding wrapping around the ceiling of the newly renovated screening room on the Warner Bros. lot? Interesting . But wait a second: Here and there, Fool's Gold shows brief signs of life in the form of 23-year-old actress Alexis Dziena , up to now best known as Sharon Stone's strip-teasing teenage daughter in Jim Jarmusch 's Broken Flowers , and cast here in the rather thankless role of Sutherland's spoiled-heiress spawn. Yet, Dziena takes this broad Paris Hilton  parody and gives her a pleasantly ditzy charm that suggests airheaded trust-fund babies have feelings, too. She's not on-screen nearly enough to merit the price of admission, but when she is, she's the only thing about Fool's Gold that isn't all washed up.
