Ask Francis Ford Coppola, and he�ll tell you it�s no small feat getting to the third movie in a series and still managing to create something watchable. More remarkable still � unprecedented, really � is making a movie that�s actually better than its predecessors. Conventional wisdom states that by the third movie in any series, lead characters have long since given up any psychological relevance and been reduced to two-dimensional lunch-box-sized pitchmen, and plots have become mere retreads of the series� earlier triumphs. Which makes The Bourne Ultimatum
 � the third in the Robert Ludlum-penned series about Jason Bourne (Damon), the rogue CIA spook with impossibly broad shoulders and the memory of a goldfish � such an achievement. Not only is it considerably better than 2002's The Bourne Identity
, but director Greengrass (United 93
, Bloody Sunday
) even bests his own excellent The Bourne Supremacy
, creating a true action thriller that�s far closer to art than it probably has any right to be. If this upward trend continues, by the time the series reaches entry six or seven (The Bourne Resignation
? The Bourne Liebestraum
?), Greengrass will be making our generation�s Grand Illusion
, or at least The Great Escape
. Episode three finds Bourne still struggling to reconstruct his identity while bringing down elaborate conspiracies percolating among the higher-ups in the American intelligence community. By this point, he tops the CIA�s most-wanted list by a mile, and even just the sight of an Algerian meter maid is enough to send him into paroxysms of paranoia that usually result in his tossing about roomfuls of hiply dressed secret agents like they were sacks of potatoes. To add insult to this inconvenience, Bourne is plagued by memories of hooded interrogations involving involuntary headfirst dips into water tanks and cursed by a complete lack of memory of anything else: He doesn�t know his real name; he can�t remember why he is where he is or why he does what he does. And � unkindest cut of all! � he can�t remember that he used to schtup Julia Stiles. How cruel can fate (and movie producers) get?!! The least you can do is leave the poor guy his erotic memories while he�s out there in the cold, running for his life. Greengrass and co. may have made one of the best action movies in recent memory, but some punishments are just too mean-spirited to inflict, even for filmmakers.


The Bourne series makes for an unusual action franchise. All the movies are exhilarating, including the third installment, The Bourne Ultimatum, which opens tonight and leaves a bruise. Part of what makes them so good is that theyre all-inclusive. You could take your mother, your teenage kids, your mailman, your history professor, and your dog  everybody goes home happy. The movies are smart  smarter than you, but not in an off-putting way. Their basic appeal, especially this new one, is that Matt Damons killing machine, Jason Bourne, is the cleverest man on earth. And we thrill to his sense of superiority.
Theres a great early sequence in Ultimatum in which Bourne, fresh from avenging his girlfriends death in the previous movie and now in Londons crowded Waterloo Station, manipulates a meeting with a reporter in the know (Paddy Considine) whose top-level contacts have won the murderous attention of the CIA. Via cellphone, Bourne choreographs the guys every move. These scenes are funny, suspenseful, and exquisitely shot and edited in a first for the movies: a pas de deux by remote control.
Bournes memory is working again and, with the help of Julia Stiles conflicted CIA agent (her part is bigger now and her hair streakier), a mental picture of his exploiters is forming. As he gets closer to putting all the pieces together, hell have similar dances with David Strathairn and Joan Allen as the pair of feds increasingly at odds with each other over how to handle Bournes eventual descent upon their offices in Manhattan. The movie, written by Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns, and George Nolfi, seems to be digging into our current surveillance and espionage quandaries.
Strathairns character spends half the movie dispatching skilled men to kill Bourne. Theyre called assets, and as the film trots the globe each city offers an asset whos hilariously ethnically appropriate and model-handsome. Its as if John Casablancas has started an assassins agency.
These films are lean and swift. The violence comes in bursts but lasts as long as some musical numbers  there are fights and chases here that would knock Bob Fosse into next week and make Bruce Lee break down in tears. The documentary transparency is characteristic of Paul Greengrass. He directed both this new installment and the previous one, 2004s The Bourne Supremacy, as well as the Sept. 11 drama United 93.
That transparent quality makes his Bourne movies seem unadulterated and unalloyed. In
other words: absurdly real, despite Bournes apparent indestructibility. The landed blows
make you wince. So does the films score, which the movie is slathered with; the sound design is so percussively good that music seems redundant.
Part of that realism extends to the movies locations. Habitually, Hollywoods wanderlust is a bid to enrich the international box office. Here the globetrotting is functional. Greengrass and his crew tailor the chases and fights to each location. The rooftops and cul-de-sacs of Tangier completely recalibrate the typical breathless foot chase. Now the physical dimensions of everything seem smaller, tighter, intensified. That sequence climaxes with an instant-classic fight in a cramped apartment between Bourne and a Casablancas killer.
Theres also a car chase in New York City that is so brutally real it seems plain impossible or just magical. Crashes as spectacular as these would make the international news.
With these Bourne movies, we can all feel like were getting what we want: unless what you desire is Matt Damon grinning. He cracks arms, legs, necks, but never a smile. Its hard to think of an actor better suited to playing this stuff with a straight face and the streak of human feeling that Jean-Claude Van Damme, Jet Li, and Jason Statham are allergic to. Harrison Ford and Bruce Willis would feel remiss if they didnt wink. But Robert Ludlum, on
whose books these movies are based, didnt write for the megaplex. He wrote to keep you
charged up on the plane. Theres no Yippee-Kay-Yay here. Youd have to go back to another Ford  Glenn  for Damons professionalism. But Glenn Ford was scarcely
the athlete Damon is.
After three movies worth of running, jumping, and some electrifying hand-to-hand combat, Damon no longer seems bewildered by his physical skills. He seems content with action-figurehood. Theres a whiff of sexual connection with Stiles, who seems downright European with all the staring her character does, but she just makes you miss the German
actress Franke Potente, who played Bournes girlfriend in the first picture. Mostly, Damon looks understandably forlorn. Id like to see him in a comedy soon, if only to confirm that he still has all his teeth.
Thats how tough these movies are. Yet theyre naturally muscular where the average Hollywood blockbuster is on human growth hormone. Many of the sequences
in Bourne seem wildly, spontaneously choreographed.
When Bourne does a running leap off one of those Tangier rooftops across an alley and into an apartment window, its a familiar action-flick move. But the immediacy takes your breath away. You might be impressed, but the movie doesnt leave a second to pat itself
on the back with a slow-motion shot or a lot of build-up. He jumps. He crashes in. He lands.
And on we go. The intruded-upon residents are spooked, but youd have to be looking hard for their startled faces, since its over for both them and us in a flash. If you need an awed reaction shot, bring date and watch his or her face.


       



IT says something about Paul Greengrass' directing style that he's able to make a movie as fresh and frank as "The Bourne Ultimatum" from a genre as moldy and bombastic as the spy thriller, but it's hard to explain what exactly, without inventing some new kind of frenetic, seen-from-all-angles-at-once Cubist grammar to describe it. 



         






  (Maybe. Something. Like. This! This. THIS!)

The third in a series kicked off by "Swingers" and "Go" director Doug Liman and now ably stewarded by Greengrass, director of the blood-chillingly understated "United 93," the Bourne films are based on Robert Ludlum's airport staple spy thrillers but ratcheted to a new level of excitement. Greengrass, clearly a philosophical type, is rarely content to show a thing from a single angle if he can show it from five. He wants us right in there, thinking on our toes and putting our heads together as if the life-threatening situation were our very own. He eliminates the polite distances between the movie and the viewer and shoves us into the chaos. 

And yet the profusion of frantic shots never feels like showboating, and the closeness never feels claustrophobic. This is also saying something, considering how thoroughly action films have used similar techniques to come out resembling steroidal video games. Greengrass is not out to "entertain" in the dismal, specious sense. He can be trusted to never dangle a shiny Tom Cruise object in front of us and expect us to sit back in brain-dead amazement as it flies across a green screen just out of singe range of an exploding CGI fireball. Greengrass' camera may scurry and dart like a rabbit trapped in a mall, but he keeps the tone grounded, the effects in-camera and the acting low-key and real. With plenty of help from director of photography Oliver Wood, screenwriters Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi and editor Christopher Rouse, Greengrass brings a degree of honesty to a completely implausible fantasy that's remarkable. 

Of course, Matt Damon helps too. Through his efforts, Jason Bourne, the fictional government-made killing machine we have followed through the two movies leading to this one (and would happily follow through a few more), stands out in a  crowded field as the humblest and most relatable existentialist government-made killing machine ever devised. Even in the slightly more disillusioned spy subgenre, it's rare to find a protagonist as soulful as Bourne. But a cosmopolitan polyglot with a brain, a conscience and no discernible attitude at all is  not something you see on the screen every day. Of course, he can still kill an opponent with a ballpoint pen if it comes to that. He's all purpose and no posturing -- the perfect antidote to the ugly American action hero. 

Updated from Ludlum's novels the better to align to post post-Cold War realities, the "Bourne" series takes our hero through three stages of enlightenment. In "The Bourne Identity," he discovers who he is. In "The Bourne Supremacy," he figures out who made him what he is, why they're still out to get him, and gets back at them for killing his girlfriend. In "The Bourne Ultimatum," he . . . looks deeper into the matter. This may not sound like much -- in fact, it's not until after the movie has ended and someone asks you what it was about that you realize how disproportionate the frenzied action is to the story's overall progress. Not that it really matters -- like the others, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is ultimately a movie about self-discovery. It moves fast but its real momentum is internal. 

When we first meet up with Bourne, he's in Moscow, where he had apologized to the orphaned daughter of the Russian politician he murdered on his first job. Ward Abbott (Brian Cox) is dead, and Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) has brought back the taped confession that should put an end to the Bourne manhunt. Soon, though, he discovers the rot had spread further than previously surmised. An article in a British newspaper suggests someone somewhere knows things about him he still doesn't know but which his persistent flashbacks suggest he should look into. 

Treadstone, the sinister secret program that created him and others like him, may be dead and buried along with its director,  Abbott,  but the umbrella operation that housed it is alive and well and being run by a shifty Department of Defense operative named Noah Vosen (David Strathairn). That Vosen is up to no good is clear even before he orders his hideously yuppie breakfast and condescends to Landy, the CIA operative who has started to develop protective instincts for lost killer-lamb Bourne. A man of his era, Vosen has taken what were once rogue black-ops more or less mainstream -- or at least as institutional as these things can get without being made public. As Bourne slowly remembers what was done to him and what he's done, Landy and Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles) start to question what they've been working for. 

As fast-paced and far-flung as the previous films (Bourne and his various pursuers hop from Turin to Paris, London to New York, Madrid to Tangiers, staying barely long enough to get their fake passports stamped) and just as action-packed, "The Bourne Ultimatum" is in some ways the most psychological film of the three, reminiscent in some ways of "The Manchurian Candidate." (The original, not the remake.) To what degree are our identities determined by conditioning? What happens to our sense of who we are when we start to question the motives of our leaders? Greengrass slips these questions in between bare-hands killings and motorcycle chases through the streets of Tangiers, where a fast thinker on the lam in an open-air market can improvise a bomb using only a can of hairspray and a kebab stand.

Damon lends an air of conscious integrity to the part, a quality of reflective introspection that acts as an amazingly effective ballast against the complete implausibility of his continued survival.

In other words, the series has always felt remarkably true-to-life for something as defiantly far-fetched. But as long as Damon keeps his focused intelligence and Greengrass continues to stay away from flaming CGI fireballs, Bourne will be able to continue to walk away unscathed from car crashes that could pulverize a rhino at half the speed with his credibility intact. They've earned it.


"The Bourne Ultimatum." MPAA rating: PG-13 for violence and intense sequences of action. Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes. In wide release.

   

Marveling at the uncanny off-center camera technique of Jaws , Alfred Hitchcock, during a TV interview late in his life, offered the following description of the director he referred to as ''young Spielberg '': ''He's the first one of us who doesn't see the proscenium arch.'' Spielberg, in other words, was the first mainstream filmmaker whose visual awareness didn't derive from the classic spatial dynamics of the theater. Watching The Bourne Ultimatum , with its swervy, headlong, you are there  images of a man on the run from forces he senses yet cannot see, I remembered Hitchcock's words, and I thought: If Spielberg doesn't see the proscenium arch, then Paul Greengrass barely even sees the stage . He's that live-wire and intoxicating a wizard of suspense.
In The Bourne Ultimatum , the camera, mostly handheld, follows the characters through train stations, airports, and the bowels of sinister office buildings (the prospect of a CIA headquarters hidden in Manhattan is a lot scarier than the one in Langley), and through the ancient zigzag stone alleys of Madrid and Tangier. At times, it zooms down from the sky, homing in on vehicles like a heat-seeking missile. Yet rarely, if ever, is there a cozy master shot. Each image is torn, aggressively, out of the one before it  the movie doesn't seem to be creating the action but catching it on the fly  and the result is that hardly a moment goes by that we don't experience in  the moment.
In one bravura sequence, Jason Bourne (Matt Damon), the renegade CIA assassin who is being hunted across three continents, tries to meet up with a British journalist (Paddy Considine) who has information that can connect Bourne to his past  that is, to his brainwashed-away identity. Shooting in downtown London, Greengrass nudges this predicament into a densely layered and exciting pursuit that rides along on tiny, jagged explosions of peril and cunning. Bourne, with his programmed existential reflexes, keeps telling the journalist by cell phone where to go, keeping him just out of the view of surveillance cameras; one wrong step and he'll be an assassin's target, a victim of Noah Vosen (David Strathairn), the head scoundrel in charge who is monitoring it all in the CIA control room. It's like a scene out of Coppola's The Conversation  kicked up to nervous high alert. You take it in not with your brain but through your feelers  your technological third eye. The civilians who swirl around in a rush-hour blur look as if they couldn't possibly be extras. Nothing feels remotely staged, yet there's a hidden design to the disorder, and it comes from Greengrass' elevation of voyeurism into a state of near-metaphysical awareness, as we watch the filmmaker watch Bourne watch his connection as he's watched by cameras that are watched by enemies who are desperate to kill him.
Tense, nervy, and dazzling, The Bourne Ultimatum  has other scenes that tingle with ingenuity, like one in which Bourne sets up a fake meeting with Pamela Landy (Joan Allen), the spymaster who's now on his side, as bait to clear out the CIA office. Or a car chase that makes you feel every crunch and bend, as the vehicles play bumper cars with the concrete. Greengrass, too, stages hand-to-hand combat with a thwacky viciousness that feels less choreographed than anything he did in The Bourne Supremacy . It may be that this director is liberated to create action with such whirling physical freedom because the story, by now, verges on the abstract. This is the movie in which Bourne finally uncovers what happened to him  a mystery that pays off, though with a bit of musty '80s Cold War didacticism. Damon, with that bruised scowling baby face, turns himself into more of a haunted machine than ever. He makes Bourne such a minimalist hero  a walking rifle slug, all frigid resolve  that his human-Terminator terseness has become a form of wit. What he can't do is lend Bourne's journey more than a token of topical urgency. Ditto for Greengrass' attempt to tone up the smeary brainwash flashbacks with ''relevant'' Abu Ghraib hoods.
The Bourne Ultimatum  is a spectacular windup toy of a thriller  a contraption made by an artist. It can't really be said, however, that the movie takes you anyplace new. That's perhaps too much to ask of a part-three sequel based on a Robert  Ludlum novel. Yet Greengrass, who stages even the simplest scene as if he were playing connect-the-dots in 3-D, has the talent to make revelatory genre movies  and, as he proved in United 93 , to elevate fear and courage into a heart-in-the-throat catharsis. That's a gift, I predict, that will one day take him to Spielbergian levels. Here's hoping that he never starts seeing the stage.

 Jaw clenched, brow knotted, body tight as a secret, Matt Damon hurtles through “The Bourne Ultimatum” like a missile. He’s a man on a mission, our Matt, and so too is his character, Jason Bourne, the near-mystically enhanced superspy who, after losing his memory and all sense of self, has come to realize that he has also lost part of his soul. For Bourne, who rises and rises again in this fantastically  kinetic, propulsive film, resurrection is the name of the game, just as it is for franchises. This is the passion of Jason Bourne, with a bullet.  Their sights set far beyond the usual genre coordinates, the three Bourne movies drill into your psyche as well as into your body. They’re unusually smart works of industrial entertainment, with action choreography that’s as well considered as the direction. Doug Liman held the reins on the first movie, with Paul Greengrass taking over for the second and third installments. And while the two men take different approaches to similar material (the more formally bold Mr. Greengrass shatters movie space  like glass), each embraces an ethos that’s at odds with the no pain, no gain, no brain mind-set that characterizes too many such flicks. Namely remorse: in these movies, you don’t just feel Bourne’s hurt, you feel the hurt of everyone he kills.  “The Bourne Ultimatum” picks up where “The Bourne Supremacy” left off, with this  former black-bag specialist for the C.I.A. grimly, inexorably moving toward final resolution. After a brush with happiness with the German woman (Franka Potente) he met in the first movie (“The Bourne Identity”) and soon lost in the second, he has landed in London. Stripped of his identity, his country and love, Bourne is now very much a man alone, existentially and otherwise. Mr. Damon makes him haunted, brooding and dark. The light seems to have gone out in his eyes, and the skin stretches so tightly across his cantilevered cheekbones that you can see the outline of his skull, its macabre silhouette. He looks like death in more ways than one.  Death becomes the Bourne series, which, in contrast to most big-studio action movies, insists that we pay attention and respect to all the flying, back-flipping and failing bodies. There’s no shortage of pop pleasure here, but the fun of these films never comes from watching men die. It’s easy to make people watch — just blow up a car, slit someone’s throat. The hard part is making them watch while also making them think about what exactly it is that they’re watching. That’s a bit of a trick, because forcing us to look at the unspeakable risks losing us, though in the Bourne series it has made for necessary surprises, like Ms. Potente’s character’s vomiting in the first movie because she has just seen a man fling himself out of a window to his death.  That scene quickly established the underlying seriousness of the series, particularly with respect to violence. There’s a similarly significant scene in the new film, which caps a beyond-belief chase sequence in which Bourne runs and runs and runs, leaping from one sun-blasted roof to the next and diving into open windows as the cops hotfoot after him. He’s trying  to chase down a man who’s trying  to chase down Bourne’s erstwhile colleague, Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). When Bourne comes fist-to-fist with the other man, Mr. Greengrass throws the camera, and us along with it, smack in the middle. It’s thrilling at first, and then — as the blows continue to fall, the bodies slow down, and a book is slammed, spine out, into one man’s neck — ghastly.  An intentional buzz kill, this fight succeeds in bringing you down off the roof, where just moments earlier you had been flying so high with Bourne. (Look at the dude go!) Mr. Greengrass knows how to do his job, and there’s no one in Hollywood right now who does action better, who keeps the pace going so relentlessly, without mercy or letup, scene after hard-rocking scene.  But he, along with the writers (here, Tony Gilroy, Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi), also wants to complicate things, mix some unease in with all the heart-thumping enjoyment. Not because he’s a sadist, or at least not entirely, but because the Bourne series is, finally, about consequences, about chickens coming home to roost.  “The Bourne Ultimatum” drives its points home forcefully, making you jump in your seat and twitch, but it’s careful not to leave any bruises.  (It’s filmmaking with a rubber hose.)  Amid the new and familiar faces (David Strathairn and Joan Allen),  it introduces a couple of power-grasping, smooth-talking ghouls and stark reminders of Abu Ghraib that might make you blanch even if you don’t throw up. As Bourne has inched closer to solving the rebus of his identity, he hasn’t always liked what he’s found. He isn’t alone. Movies mostly like to play spy games pretty much for kicks, stoking us with easy brutality and cool gadgets that get us high and get us going,  whether our gentlemen callers dress in  tuxes or track suits.  What’s different about the Bourne movies is the degree to which they have been able to replace the pleasures of cinematic violence with those of movie-made kinetics — action, not just blood. Mr. Greengrass and his superb team do all their dazzling with technique. They take us inside an enormous train station and a cramped room and then, with whipping cameras and shuddering edits, break that space into bits as another bullet finds its mark, another body hits the ground, and the world falls apart just a little bit more. Without fail, Mr. Greengrass always picks up those pieces, reshaping them so that Bourne can move to the next location, the next kill, as he gets closer and closer to the mystery of his terrible existence.  “The Bourne Ultimatum” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has graphic and very intense violence, if relatively little blood.

If they could bottle what gives "The Bourne Ultimatum" its rush, it would probably be illegal. The third and purportedly final installment in the mountingly exciting series is a pounding, pulsating thriller that provides an almost constant adrenaline surge for nearly two hours. Worldwide B.O. will be terrific and likely surpass that for each of the previous two pictures, which combined pulled down more than $500 million.
In setting Jason Bourne on the home stretch of his search to discover who and what made him the killing machine he is, director Paul Greengrass has outdone himself, creating a film of such sustained energy and tension that the infrequent pauses for breath seem startling in their quietude. In other hands, unrelenting nervous camera movement and machine-gun cutting prove wearying more often than not, but Greengrass skillfully employs both not only in the service of excitement, but for the accentuation of telling detail and discreet parceling out of information.
Result is a breathless doozy that sends Bourne from Moscow to Turin, Paris, London, Madrid and Tangier, Morocco, before alighting in New York, from where the CIA's extra-legal assassination org has been tracking his movements with the most sophisticated and instantaneous of high-tech equipment. But Bourne continually beats the agency at its own game, outwitting and tricking its surveillance ploys and besting the toughest killers the company can throw at him.
Having settled certain scores in "Supremacy" three years ago, Bourne (Matt Damon) is determined to retrieve his memory this time around, so as to learn the identity he had before placing his skills at the service of the agency. Spurring this opportunity are articles by a London journo (Paddy Considine) in which revelatory details of Bourne's career were obviously provided by a highly knowledgeable source.
After a hair-raising pursuit of Bourne and the scribe at London's Waterloo Station, Bourne tracks the source to Spain, where he once again meets CIA op Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles), and then to Tangier, where a CIA "asset," or hitman, is lying in wait. An amazing chase through the port city's twisty, hilly streets and the teeming passages of the old Medina, then over rooftops and through windows, and finally to a gasping, slashing, hand-to-hand combat scene in a cramped bathroom, is a marvel of technique and sheer logistics, and one that makes marvelous use of a legendary city rarely seen in Western cinema.
Along the way, it becomes clear the CIA has replaced its former black-ops program, Treadstone, with a new one called Blackbriar, which under stern topper Noah Vosen (David Strathairn) displays a propensity for rogue action and killing as a ready solution to all problems. As they listen in on phone calls and observe Bourne's movements their secret Manhattan HQ (never before has a feature film so well documented London's pervasive surveillance cameras), Vosen and colleague Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) argue over what to do with Bourne. Landy, who developed a certain affinity for the lone wolf in Berlin three years back, wants to keep him alive, while Vosen repeatedly insists upon whacking him. Latter's increasing frustration over the mounting failures to do so amply contributes to the very pure audience pleasure the picture generates.
Greengrass stages one spectacular set piece after another, virtually all of them in crowded public places -- train stations, airports, cafes, bottlenecked city streets -- that lend the action scenes an unsurpassed sense of verisimilitude. Bourne walks away from more than one auto crash that would have finished off lesser men, but he and we know that nothing is going to stop him before he comes face to face with his own Dr. Frankenstein, a man whose image periodically flashes through his mind.
Resolution to this central issue of the three films, as well as to individual fates of secondary characters, proves highly satisfactory, resulting in that rare tumultuous thriller that can't be faulted at all on its own terms. The continuity and even upgrade in quality as the series has progressed can be significantly attributed to a solid team that hasn't changed much across the seven years; producers Frank Marshall, Patrick Crowley and Paul L. Sandberg have been onboard for the entire ride, as have story and screenwriter Tony Gilroy (this time credited alongside Scott Z. Burns and George Nolfi), cinematographer Oliver Wood, editor Christopher Rouse and composer John Powell, whose urgent musical accompaniment is goosed by some striking string and percussion orchestrations. Second unit and stunt work overseen by Dan Bradley is top-drawer. Nor should one forget Doug Liman, who continues on as an exec producer after having set the artistic template as director of the initial outing.
It may not have been entirely apparent at first, but Bourne is unquestionably Damon's signature role, the one in which a viewer becomes most complicit in the actor's identification with a character. The subjective camerawork merely augments the degree to which one is completely with him in the series, and if this is indeed his last "Bourne," as he has said, then this is a performance to be savored all the more.
Stymied by limited action in earlier rounds, Stiles has more to do this time but remains deliberately understated. A low-key Strathairn proves mightily effective in an against-type turn as the quietly seething heavy, while Allen shrewdly reveals a woman dedicated to creatively subverting the constraints of her highly regulated job. Scott Glenn turns up briefly as a new CIA director, and Albert Finney effectively lends his weight, basso tones and a slight Southern drawl to his man-behind-the-curtain character.

The Bourne Ultimatum  opens in Russia as the amnesiac super-spy Jason Bourne  (Matt Damon ) does what he does best: eludes capture, cracks skulls, broods. Lickety-split he's en route to Paris, nursing his wounds and breaking out with a bad case of those itchy-scratchy hallucinations known as Hollywood  Flashback Syndrome. Choice and painful bits from The Bourne Identity  and The Bourne Supremacy  whiz through his mind's eye, but before you can mutter "not another threequel" the movie goes into a full-blown techno-thriller frenzy, scattering hyper-compressed plot points from Moscow  to Paris to Langley, London, Turin , and New York.
So much for the first 10 minutes, goddamn.
Here's what's up: Simon Ross  (Paddy Considine ), "security correspondent" for The London Guardian , has been tipped in Turin about a black-op CIA  umbrella program code-named Blackbriar, the mere mention of which on a cell phone flags some terrifyingly competent post-Patriot Act  software. Enter a shady, warmongering CIA bigwig (David Strathairn ) and a sweet, nonviolent one (Joan Allen ), plus various background über-spooks (Scott Glenn , Albert Finney ). Bourne gets caught in the middle when he blips on the grid in pursuit of Ross, whose 411 on Blackbriar may finally explain why he kicks so much ass.
Adapted from Robert Ludlum 's novel by a trio of writers who never met a cloak-and-dagger chestnut they didn't swallow whole, the story of Bourne's quest for his origins is often as formulaic as a dry martini, shaken not stirred. But where Bond movies are juiced by a conflict of egos, the Bourne adventures are all about competing intelligence systemsas manifested through action set-pieces. In the case of Ultimatum , make that flabbergasting, mind-boggling, next-level action set-pieces.
This is director Paul Greengrass 's second Bourne  picture after Supremacy , but it's also a stealth sequel to his last film, United 93 . Both are up to the same basic business: generating tension through the interface of two meticulously paced, discretely parceled, highly pressurized sets of information. United 93  unfolds in the unbearable gap between the knowledge of the passengers and the facts on the grounda distance rendered even more agonizing by our  awareness of how it all turns out.
Ultimatum  is structured around three gargantuan cat-and-mouse pursuits, each of which pits the extensive, elaborate, high-tech eyes and ears of the CIA against the mobile, intuitive, ultra-alert mind of a single (super) man. The excitement of these sequences has less to do with stunts (first-rate) or spectacle (best car chase ever ) than the tango between these two intelligencesand the ways in which the spectator is invited to the dance.
In an astonishing Waterloo Station sequence, where Bourne attempts to make contact with and protect the journalist Ross, Greengrass establishes the CIA surveillance network in tremendous detailvideo monitors, field agents, secret microphones, digital schematicsthen super-charges the suspense through Bourne's detection and circumvention. What's exhilarating here is the clarity of design, the cleverness of its thwarting, and the way the filmmaking immerses the viewer in the whole process.
Greengrass's Supremacy  was one of the few movies to justify a spasmodic handheld aesthetic by keying to its controlling consciousness (a freaked-out amnesiac), thus placing us into an equivalent state of mind as we struggle to steady the flow of visual information just as Bourne struggles to make sense of his circumstances. Ultimatum  refines this participatory dynamic even further.
Bravura doesn't begin to describe Greengrass's skill in mounting these complex sequences, the second of which maximizes the chaotic topography of the medina in Tangier  with the third wreaking magnificent havoc on the streets of Manhattan. This is, simply put, some of the most accomplished filmmaking being done anywhere for any purpose.
I much prefer such virtuosity in the service of unencumbered entertainment to the, uh . . . what was the point of United 93  again? Not that Ultimatum  lacks an agenda; it's actually the more overtly political of the two movies, imparting a coherent message and taking an intelligible stand. Bourne is the action hero as blowbackblack sheep of the black-op set, figured in terms of post-9/11 protocols. His early deprogramming is repeatedly linked to the contemporary iconography of humiliation (black hoods) and torture (waterboarding). Strathairn's CIA  agent defends his methods as necessary until "we've won," appropriating the counterintuitive rhetoric of the "war on terror."
As a political statement, United 93  was defended as a critique of government failurea rebuttal to the flawless anti-terror tactics of 24 but you could claim the same for any number of military yahoo movies. What's troubling is its pretense to objectivity, the claim to being as close as possible to an authoritative (even authorized!) re-creation. It is as it was? United 93  and The Passion of the Christ  are basically the same movie for different audiences.
Ultimatum  doesn't have that cross to bear. It's responsible only to the code of the blockbuster. Concentrating on an effective dramatic resolution may explain why the political conclusion is delivered with such unexpected forcethe allegory is unforced. The entire Bourne  trilogy has been a maze of intrigue and double-cross winding to a final face-off with the Minotaur: the beast that made Bourne who he is. What (and whom) Ultimatum  ultimately confronts flips the standard conspiracy thriller on its head. Greengrass gets there so deftly it's enough to make yours spin.
