If you've just come from seeing David Cronenberg's recently released Eastern Promises
, it's likely you'll wonder what the deal is with all these Russian gangsters in the movies of late. However, anyone familiar with writer/director Gray's two prior films (Little Odessa
 and The Yards
) will recognize that such mobsters are recurrent characters throughout his work. The Russian crime syndicate in New York and conflicts between brothers on opposite sides of the law: These are Gray's recurrent (redundant?) themes. That Wahlberg and Phoenix both co-starred in Gray's last film, 2000's The Yards
, doesn't ease We Own the Night
's sense of d�j� vu. Set in 1988 at the height of NYC's drug-fueled crime years (which provided grist for Rudy Giuliani's premayoral career as a famously tough-on-crime U.S. attorney), We Own the Night
 is rife with the kind of familiar twists that have always driven these sorts of films. Phoenix is cast as Bobby Green, the manager of a popular Brooklyn nightclub. He is somewhat distanced from his police-officer relatives, brother Joseph (Wahlberg) and father Burt Grusinsky (Duvall), using a different surname and keeping the truth about the family business from his girlfriend (Mendes) and associates. However, it's not long before Joseph conducts a drug bust on the premises of Bobby's club, and once Joseph is fingered for retribution, Bobby jumps sides and decides to assist the law. It's a plot we've seen dozens of times before, but the combined screen presence of the dynamic Phoenix, subdued Wahlberg, and trusty Duvall lends the film a solidity it otherwise might not have had. Former Mayor Ed Koch also shows up playing himself 20 years earlier, but some of the film's other period details fall short of their marks due to quibbling inaccuracies and improbabilities. This is most evident during several plot loopholes during which viewers are forced to accept as standard police procedure instances of inadequate self-protection and dismal custody practices. These instances further the plot but degrade the film's sense of veracity. Gray's signature long takes and overhead shots are in evidence and add to the film's fatalistic tone, and one rainy car-chase sequence is a real keeper. But, overall, it's impossible to shake the film's gloomy sense of eternal repetition.


James Gray's new cops-vs.-drug-lord melodrama, "We Own the Night," is not a great movie. It's long and extremely slight, like a sheet of paper that aspires to be steel. But the movie has a great title, great hair (the best career choice Eva Mendes has yet made is letting the film's stylists have her look like Taylor Dayne), one great defenestration, and, because Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg do a lot of the talking, great mumbling. Two of the movies' master mutterers, they supply a double tour-de-force of indifference to enunciation, steamrolling the English language until it sounds like some other dialect.
They play the Grusinskys, estranged Polish-American brothers in 1988 Brooklyn. Bobby (Phoenix) manages a hangar-size, Russian-operated nightspot called El Caribe, and does his share of smoking, snorting, and drinking with his hood ornament of a girlfriend (Mendes). Conveniently, Joseph (Wahlberg) has just been promoted to captain of an NYPD narcotics unit and, since one of his targets, a scary fellow named Nezhinski (Alex Veadov), might be operating out of El Caribe, he would like his brother's help in catching him. Bobby has been using his late mother's surname (it's Green), and the last thing he wants is for his clubland bosses and buddies to know about his law enforcement bloodline - Papa Grusinsky (Robert Duvall) is a police chief.
It's almost not worth mentioning which actor plays which brother, since the descriptions seem self-explanatory. If you'd like to see Mark Wahlberg coked-up in a disco trading deep, noisy kisses with Eva Mendes, I'll sign the petition. But Wahlberg's Dirk Diggler days seem firmly, prematurely behind him. Joseph is an upstanding family man with a drug war to win. A grim turn of events provides Bobby with an opportunity to redeem himself in his family's eyes - and Phoenix with an occasion to brood, wail, and smolder.
Bobby is a confused character, a black sheep who too suddenly wants back into the flock. Everything about this character would seem silly if Phoenix didn't seem to feel every ounce of him in his soul. As refreshing as it would have been for him and Wahlberg to switch parts, only Phoenix could convince you of the wealth of ambivalence roiling this man.
Having directed Phoenix and Wahlberg together before, James Gray doesn't appear to want to mess with a good thing. But in merely making "We Own the Night" with these two, he kind of has. His last Brooklyn outing with them, "The Yards," a movie about a guy who goes to jail to protect his gangster buddy, was a find: an atmospheric, eerily quiet thriller with a duplex of Hollywood acting. On this floor: Faye Dunaway, Ellen Burstyn, and James Caan. And on this one: Phoenix, Wahlberg, and Charlize Theron. You miss the mixed constellations in this movie, which Gray had incredible control over. "The Yards" was so unhappy and sunless that only in the strictest sense could it not have been considered a vampire picture.
"We Own the Night" is another, somewhat inferior helping of same. The story follows conventions the previous movie didn't seem aware of - there's not much he can do with cops and kingpins; the movie's plot points are like dull coordinates on a moral-urban grid. Gray seems content to have made a yarn with interesting nightlife scenes. The movie's 1988 doesn't seem a month past 1979. Bobby's club is still playing Blondie. And the vibe - shirts as open as windows, thick gold neck chains, all the snarling - seems in pursuit of some "Saturday Night Fever" frontier. The spirit is pure Sidney Lumet, that powerfully urban-minded director whose grit and fury are in the Hollywood bloodstream right now. Why do the movies lust after him suddenly?
Gray isn't the electrician Lumet was. At his best, Lumet could light up that grid. But Gray's movies, including his blistering 1994 debut, "Little Odessa," burrow under New York's surface with a raw, jazzy grace of their own. The final shot in "We Own the Night" is unexpectedly moving. The textures are thick and the color vividly local - urine yellows and fish-tank greens. The sound design sleekly conjures up the ominousness of certain horror films. And the movie's climactic car chase is as absurdly thrilling as it is innovative. Set almost silently in a blue-gray daytime downpour, it has a tough, improvisatory danger that makes the movie. If John Coltrane went in for action sequences, he'd have dug this one.


         Brothers, loyalty, the Russian mob and New York City's outer boroughs continue to fascinate filmmaker James Gray, whose "We Own the Night" marks his third feature in a dozen years following "Little Odessa" and "The Yards." It's a bare-knuckled crime drama set in 1988 that stylistically could have been made that year and emphasizes Gray's strengths as a director while drawing attention to his limitations as a writer.
 
  "We Own the Night" reunites "The Yards' " Joaquin Phoenix and Mark Wahlberg as brothers whose chosen vocations come into conflict. Phoenix plays Bobby Green (born Grusinsky), a Brooklyn club manager who likes to put some distance between himself and his familial ties to the NYPD by using his mother's maiden name. Those ties would include his newly promoted brother, Joseph (Wahlberg), and their deputy-chief father, Burt (Robert Duvall), who embody the notion that the bonds of the police force are at least as tight as those of blood.
 


         






   Phoenix cuts a coolly decadent figure as black sheep Bobby, with his Puerto Rican girlfriend, Amada (Eva Mendes), on his arm as he swoops through his lavish club, El Caribe. The wicked grin on his face belies the fact that the success he is enjoying running the place for Russian fur importer Marat Bushayev (Moni Moshonov) is the first he has had as an adult.
 
 Raining on that parade are his father and brother who ask Bobby to keep an eye on a fast-rising drug dealer, Vadim Nezhinski (Alex Veadov), who operates out of the club and is Marat's nephew. Bobby resists, placing his entrepreneurial responsibilities over family obligations and sets in motion a series of events that seal his destiny.
 
 The indisputable focal point of the film, Phoenix successfully infuses Bobby's swagger and torment with charisma and brooding melancholy.  Wahlberg and Duvall are strong in roles well within their wheelhouses and Mendes and Danny Hoch, as Bobby's grinning flunky, liven up stock characters.
 
 Gray's strong suits are the big emotional scenes that play out among his lead characters and the action set pieces that give the movie a sense of urgency.
 
 Less assured are major plot points that stretch -- and in some cases, snap -- the suspension of disbelief. Bobby's attempt to tread the murky region between good and evil unravels predictably and  though his fate carries the seeming inevitability of Greek drama, it also bears some of the contrivance.
 
 However, if you're able to let all of that go, Gray's skill with meting out suspense pays considerable dividends. From an opening montage of black-and-white stills nostalgically depicting a pre-Giuliani/Bratton NYPD that slams into a Blondie-powered entry into Bobby's world, the film crackles viscerally. The implied pungency of sex, sweat and cigarettes permeates most scenes recalling the gritty cop dramas of the 1970s and '80s, at least in tone and temperament.

A few rare dramas about crime, honor, and justice  The Godfather , The Verdict , Munich   have attained a mythological quality. The writer-director James Gray is desperate to make a movie that would join their ranks, but the trouble with his films, which include Little Odessa , The Yards , and the new We Own the Night , is that he doesn't earn mythology. He imposes it from above.
Set in New York in the high party days of 1988, We Own the Night  tells the charged tale of two brothers. Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix), a dissolute hellion with a crooked smile and a diamond stud in his ear, manages a vast nightclub built out of an old movie theater. Joseph (Mark Wahlberg), his opposite number, is a decorated cop assigned to a narcotics task force, which leads him to shake down a drug dealer operating out of Bobby's club. I won't divulge more, except to say that the film is full of showy set pieces, and a handful of them are smashingly done. A variation on the guy-wearing-a-wire-during-a-drug-deal bit had me sucking in my breath; a car chase shot in the drenching rain is violent, tumultuous, and original. And yet...the story is too patterned and too contrived. (How could a hustler like Bobby be this  naive about the club's ''kindly'' owner?) It's like a more abstract Godfather  in moral reverse, with one key figure undergoing a transformative spiritual rebirth I never fully bought. Gray is a far better director than he is a writer. He's got the talent to make great movies. He just needs to stop trying to.

 On a show like “The Wire,” policemen and criminals belong to competitive organizations locked in uneasy, permanent coexistence. In “We Own the Night,”  James Gray’s operatic new film, the police and drug dealers are imagined as warring tribes in a fight to the death. The Russian gangsters on one side appear ready to take out the entire N.Y.P.D. (“We get them all!”) And some of the cops are just as eager to forgo the legal niceties and do some righteous killing of their own (“Wipe ’em out. No survivors.”).  In other words, “We Own the Night” is not a procedural, in which the narrative is threaded through details of the job and close observations of big-city life. It is, rather, a bloody, passionate melodrama, self-consciously Shakespearean — or Biblical, or Greek, take your pick of atavisms — in its intentions. At the center are two brothers: Joseph Grusinsky (Mark Wahlberg), a clean-cut, ambitious family man rising quickly through the ranks of the department, and Bobby Green (Joaquin Phoenix), who has forsaken the family surname and who manages a raucous nightclub in Brooklyn.  Cain and Abel; the ant and the grasshopper. Bobby and Joseph present, at least at first, wildly contrasting temperaments as well as divergent career choices. Joseph takes after their father, Burt (Robert Duvall), a high-ranking officer who can barely contain his disappointment and disgust when Bobby is in the room. But Bobby, while he may be as irresponsible as his father and brother think he is, also has a sweet, impulsive, hedonistic side. He shows it in an early scene of sexual bliss with his girlfriend, Amada (Eva Mendes), and in the way he bounces through his cavernous club and into the apartment of its owner, a grandfatherly Russian named Buzhayev. Bobby is loving, and also lovable.  But he is also, within the film’s fatalistic universe, a traitor, or at least a prodigal who must be brought back into the fold. Much as he may revel in the company of his surrogate family — the Buzhayev clan is warm and welcoming, and Bobby’s sidekick Jumbo (Danny Hoch) is a bubbly fountain of brotherly affection — the claims of blood are always stronger. And once Mr. Buzhayev’s gangster nephew Vadim (Alex Veadov) causes Joseph to be hurt, Bobby puts away his childish sense of fun and gets down to the grim business of settling scores.  As this happens, the life begins to leak out of “We Own the Night,” and especially out of Mr. Phoenix’s performance. In the actor’s case, this seems deliberate, as if he had chosen to interpret grief as a form of petrifaction. His elbows and shoulders stiffen, and he lumbers across the sets like a Frankenstein monster. Even his tongue seems paralyzed. Mr. Gray, meanwhile, strides manfully into a thicket of clichés and heavy grandiosity.  When it works, though — especially in those earlier scenes, when Bobby and Joseph are at each other’s throats (and Bobby and Amada are in each other’s pants), and in a brilliantly executed car chase later on —  “We Own the Night” demonstrates a rough, lived-in authority and an unpretentious sense of craft. In his previous films, “Little Odessa” (another grim story involving the Russian mob) and “The Yards” (an unjustly neglected tale of political corruption), Mr. Gray evoked the urban crime dramas of earlier eras without being showy or self-conscious about it. And there is certainly nothing fancy or gimmicky about this movie.  But there is nothing especially interesting or new, either. “We Own the Night,” which takes its title from the slogan of the N.Y.P.D.’s street crime unit, is set in 1988, a wilder and more dangerous time in the city’s history (though perhaps not quite so wild and dangerous as Mr. Gray makes it seem). But in spite of a few historically apt musical selections and a digitally enhanced cameo appearance by former Mayor Ed Koch, this is less a period movie than an exercise in free-floating nostalgia.  It’s not nostalgia for any particular time or place, but rather for a mythical, tribal America where the obligations of clan trump individual desires. Authority in this world is patriarchal: Women are always being told to leave the room, mind the children or wait in the car. An index of Bobby’s betrayal is that he has adopted his mother’s maiden name, and his attempt to escape into a life of easy pleasure, social mobility and self-invention is doomed from the start. Where he ends up is where he always belonged.  This is a profoundly sentimental idea, one that flourishes in the collective fantasy life fed by television and the movies. The problem with “We Own the Night” is that it mistakes sentiment for profundity, and takes its ideas about character and fate more seriously than it takes its characters and their particular fates. “I feel light as a feather,” Bobby says in a crucial scene, at which point the movie starts to sink like a stone.  “We Own the Night” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, drug use and abundant profanity. 

"We Own the Night" is an exceptionally conventional crime drama about Brooklyn brothers who find themselves on opposite sides of the law circa 1988. Adequately acted and flecked with the required quota of action to satisfy genre fans, pic recalls numerous good police dramas of the 1970s, but mostly in superficial ways that bring nothing new to the table. Acquired by Sony for North American release shortly before its world preem in competition at the Cannes Film Festival, meller should ride its good cast and crime slant to reasonable B.O. returns.
Director-writer James Gray enjoys a following on the fest circuit due to his previous two Gotham-set crimers, "Little Odessa" and "The Yards," which scored in Venice and Cannes, respectively, but underperformed commercially. His first film in seven years, "We Own the Night" again puts Russian gangsters at the center of things, although this time up against Brooklyn cops, in particular a Polish-American family so traditionally conceived that they would have been right at home in an MGM film of 1936.
Yarn pivots on the troubled relationship between Joseph and Bobby, Brooklyn brothers now in their 30s. At the outset, they've seen little of one another in ages, as Joseph (Mark Wahlberg) followed in the footsteps of his father (Robert Duvall) to become a cop, while Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix) has become a successful, coked-up nightclub manager so anxious to distance himself from his straight-arrow family he's even changed his last name.
No one Bobby works with knows he's from a police family, least of all his boss, genial old Russian Marat Bujayev (Moni Moshonov), whose sinister nephew Vadim (Alex Veadov) is well on his way to becoming Gotham's biggest drug dealer. The dramatic vice tightens when Vadim, an unsavory regular at the El Caribe club, suggests Bobby join him in his narcotics business just as the Brooklyn cops announce they're going to get tough on drugs and Joseph asks Bobby to be an informer.
When Joseph leads a raid on El Caribe, Bobby and Vadim are both arrested. But no sooner is Vadim released for lack of evidence than he tracks down the earnest cop in front of his house and shoots him, execution style. Joseph miraculously survives, while Bobby sees the light and nervously agrees to infiltrate Vadim's operation as an undercover man. Several turns for the worse afflict the bumbling, old-style police, who are regarded contemptuously by Vadim, before they remotely begin to turn the tables. And it's a given that family life on both sides will never be the same when all is said and done.
Simply because of the setup, with its elemental emotions, family bonds and conflicts, and stark good guy-bad guy delineations, the story pulls the viewer in. Gray also creates two or three effective set pieces, notably a scary car chase in a torrential (and computer-generated) downpour, that are undeniably arresting. After that, reactions to the film will depend greatly upon one's degree of personal tolerance for dramatic implausibilities, plot loopholes, emotional cliches and period anachronisms.
To begin with the latter, viewers familiar with Brooklyn in the late '80s will know that a giant, glitzy disco along the lines of the film's El Caribe (clearly patterned upon Manhattan's Limelight) never existed there at the time; Blondie's "Heart of Glass," played at the outset, is a song one would choose to position one's film in 1978, not a decade later; clothing and geographic details are off, and even a famous commercial overheard on a car radio is from the incorrect period. When small things like these, which will not bother young or unalert viewers, are wrong, one loses confidence in the authority being exercised over larger issues.
And with good reason. As the story motors along, the puzzling gaffes and unacceptable contrivances accumulate to an extent that becomes far too great to swallow or ignore. A villain miraculously eludes a police vice not just once but twice; police don't augment their level of self-protection despite knowing they're marked men; Bobby absents himself from his club job for an inordinate period, seemingly without raising the suspicions of his boss or associates; and one character acts rashly during the dramatic climax, entering a burning field of tall grasses when it seems not only unnecessary but inadvisable except for the striking visual opportunities that doing so will provide.
Performances are solid but unsurprising. Phoenix frets and sweats as his character becomes increasingly squeezed, Wahlberg is not as lively or dimensional as he was in either "The Departed" or "Shooter," and Duvall can do this sort of crusty old cop in his sleep. As Bobby's squeeze, Eva Mendes convincingly plays the slide of an enthusiastic party girl's feelings as her mate drags her into aggravating jeopardy and isolation. Veadov is understated venality itself as the aspiring king of New York. Twenty years on, former mayor Ed Koch amusingly appears as himself.
Ultimately, "We Own the Night" plays like little more than an OK television movie, which is hardly enough after years of "The Sopranos" and "The Wire."

Of all the members of a generation of filmmakers who wanted to be the next Scorsese, James Gray  was different: He wanted to be the next Scorsese, Christopher Marlowe , and Georges de la Tour . That ambition seems little diminished in this, his third film in 13 years, set in his chosen milieu of outer-borough lowlife. Bobby (Joaquin Phoenix ), sybaritic manager of a Brooklyn  nightclub, shuns his family's NYPD  legacy, and his father and brother on the force (Robert Duvall  and Mark Wahlberg ) resent his independence. The '80s drug wars are raging, and both dealers and cops vie for Bobby's cooperation; circumstances align him with the "good guys," and an ironic tragedy of falling into grace is set in motion as Bobby's new sense of duty damns him to the solemn moral wilderness of law and order. Helpless with comedy, heavily reliant on coincidence, and out of step with all current cinematic voguethe film received a divisive Cannes  receptionWe Own the Night  finally resonates as a beautiful, dolorous nocturne. The closest thing Gray's done to a commercial actioner, the film also applies his genius for tone (aided by superlative sound work) to set pieces that throb with trauma: a tinnitus-soundtracked shoot-out and a rain-slick car chase set to the tempo of windshield wipers.
