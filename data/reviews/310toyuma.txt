Westerns and remakes are two film categories whose reputations have sagged in the modern age of moviegoing. 3:10 to Yuma
 is the movie that puts the lie to these presumptive myths: This film is an example of a Western that ought to appeal to a healthy-sized contemporary audience and is also a remake of the 1957 film of the same name, which is a hallmark of the type of psychological Western (i.e., High Noon
 and Shane
) popular 50 years ago. Director Mangold is best known for his most recent film, Walk the Line
, though his career choices have veered all over the map, from his bracing indie debut film, Heavy
, to the hysterics of Girl, Interrupted
 and from the dark genre piece Cop Land
 to the fantasy romance of Kate & Leopold
. In the end, perhaps this scattershot approach has prepared Mangold well for tackling this giant from the past without trepidation or slavish idolatry. His 3:10 to Yuma
 is just different enough and yet faithful to the original (which is based on a short story by then-young Elmore Leonard) to score a success. Casting Crowe and Bale, two of the finest actors around, as the story's two central characters is a coup. Crowe's reputation for drawing in crowds has taken something of a beating with his recent film choices (A Good Year
, Cinderella Man
, Master and Commander
), so his turn here as self-serving Ben Wade, the leader of a vicious gang of stagecoach-robbing outlaws, is no sure thing. Yet he infuses the character with just the right mix of violent menace and tender intelligence to make the character believably complex (that is, at least until the absolute final minutes of the movie, during which sentimental and preposterous actions on Wade's part trump all pretenses of believability). Bale brings his usual intensity to the role of Dan Evans, a rancher who's hobbled by the area's lack of rain, as well as an old Civil War injury. Additionally, his inability to feed his hungry cattle and family makes him feel inadequate as a man. When an opportunity to earn $200 by helping to bring the serendipitously captured Wade to Yuma to board the 3:10pm prison train, the usually reluctant-to-get-involved Evans seizes the chance. Fonda is practically unrecognizable in his excellent performance as a gruff Pinkerton man, and Foster brings an electric energy to his role as Wade's sociopathic second-in-command. Apart from the final minutes of the film that strike its only false note, 3:10 to Yuma
 barrels down the track at full force.


Is it my imagination, or have the movies gone into the Wayback Machine and come out in the late 1950s? Genres thought dead and moldering in their film canisters are suddenly back on their feet. Hairspray, Once, and even Disneys High School Musical have revived the musical, and now the classic western is getting a reboot. Early buzz on The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford is building well in advance of its October release; until then, well have to be content with the lean, almost absurdly satisfying 3:10 to Yuma.
This ones actually a remake of a 1957 movie of the same title, one in a string of tough, mature Eisenhower-era oaters. (High Noon is the best known, but by x all means seek out the series of westerns James Stewart made with director Anthony Mann.) Based on an early Elmore Leonard short story, the original starred Glenn Ford as a legendary outlaw and Van Heflin as the average-guy rancher charged with conveying the villain to the title train that will take him to justice.
In the new 3:10 to Yuma, the outlaw, Ben Wade, is played by Russell Crowe The rancher, Dan Evans, is played by Christian Bale. Nostalgists can kick all they want, but this is an improvement. Both actors are among the best, most intuitively creative we have, and whatever transpires offscreen in Crowes case, onscreen they only serve their characters. Neither man showboats here, and its a thrill to watch them work.
The rancher is one step from complete failure when the movie opens. The man who owns his land wants to burn Dan out so the railroad can come through; drought has ruined the growing season; his wife (Gretchen Mol) and 14-year-old son William (Logan Lerman) look on him with contempt. Dan came out of the Civil War with a wooden leg, and we sense the other ones about to go.
By contrast, Ben Wade is a stone8hearted killer and Dans opposite number, but as in the original hes anything but crude. Crowe rarely raises his voice the entire picture, keeping it in the conversational upper register of his range. Ben is something of a self-taught intellectual with a minor in human nature; to see him seduce a barmaid (Vinessa Shaw) with talk alone  and to almost do the same to both Dan and his wife in separate scenes  is to witness a snake and a snake charmer in one irresistible package.
Wades gang holds up a stagecoach carrying railroad money; its guarded by a contingent of Pinkerton detectives led by a grizzled ex-Indian fighter named Byron McElroy. Peter Fonda does something quite wonderful with this role: He plays John Wayne as a highly functioning S.O.B. (An ex-hippies revenge on the Duke or an actors inspired choice? The performance works as both.)
Flush with their own invincibility, the robbers ride to the nearby outpost of Bisbee, where a momentary lapse results in Wade being taken prisoner by the local law. A hastily gathered posse convenes to get the badman to the train depot in Contention, five days away, and theyre a classic crew of mixed types: the bookish town horse doctor (Alan Tudyk), the young braggart (Kevin Durand), the dandified Southern Pacific company man (Dallas Roberts). McElroy leads the group; Dan signs up in exchange for $200 that he prays will save his ranch.
Trailing them at a jackals distance is Charlie Prince, Wades second in command and one of those quivering nutjobs that genre movies love to offer talented young actors. Ben Foster (Alpha Dog) rises to the occasion; behind Charlies unblinking blue eyes is a loyalty to his boss that goes beyond propriety, sexuality, even sanity. The boys mesmerizing.
Over the course of the journey to Contention, as the ever-dwindling posse deals with the hostile remnants of the Apache nation, corrupt railroad men (including Luke Wilson, in a smallish role), and Dans own rebellious son, a bond grows between the rancher and the outlaw. Both of them are surprised to see the decency in Dan grow stronger with testing; each finds things to like and to detest in the other man.
This sort of relationship has to be played just right to work, and Bale and Crowe never once misstep. The former finds new shades for his air of wounded gravity  Bales one of the few actors who can make earnestness interesting  while Crowe dances between the playful, the cunning, and the lethal without breaking a sweat.
The direction by James Mangold (Walk the Line) is similarly unfussy, devoted to narrative momentum and deepening character without making a big deal about it. Mangold is consciously fashioning an old-school Hollywood western here, and he steers clear of Deadwood revisionism. The approach is honest and foursquare, and he has the filmmaking chops to put it across, but the classicism sometimes gets laid on a bit thick. Mol and Shaw are the prettiest Arizona settlers seen since John Ford was in his prime.
Then theres the problem of the films ending, which sticks (as does much of the dialogue) to the letter and spirit of the 1957 original. Without spoiling things, I can say that one character suddenly behaves in a profoundly uncharacteristic way, so much so that were left scratching our heads. Its a twist that works in a short story and that you still might buy in a 1950s film, but it makes little to no sense in a post-Clint Eastwood universe, at least without the proper set-up.
Until then, 3:10 to Yuma is a tonic: a throwback expertly retrofitted with new parts. In one telling campfire scene, Dan has to slice up the handcuffed Wades steak dinner, and the badman patiently instructs his captor to pare away the fat and the gristle. Thats how Mangold prefers it, too: lean and well-done.


         If "3:10 to Yuma" feels familiar, and it does, it's not just because it's a remake of the classic 1957 western. Almost every plot point -- psycho gunslingers, savage Apaches, even doctors who say "that bullet has to come out" -- is a trope that has been a genre standard for decades.
 
 But what's most impressive about this new version, starring Russell Crowe as a charismatic outlaw and Christian Bale as the downtrodden rancher who crosses his path, is that James Mangold directs it with such energy and passion that it's as if he didn't know it's all been done before.
 


         






   Approaching this material with the enthusiasm of a famished man confronting his first square meal in days, Mangold has brought welcome intensity to the project, giving "3:10 to Yuma" a visceral, immediate quality that makes it realistic and mythic all at the same time.
 
 The director, best known for the Johnny Cash biopic "Walk the Line," has been a fan of the Delmer Daves-directed original -- which began life as an Elmore Leonard short story and starred Glenn Ford as the outlaw and Van Heflin as the rancher -- for more than 20 years.
 
 But that hasn't stopped Mangold (whose forte is modernizing traditional material) and screenwriters Michael Brandt and Derek Haas from reusing and crediting some of the dialogue from Halsted Welles' original script while simultaneously upping the ante in all areas.
 
 So "3:10 to Yuma's" psychos are numerous and deeply psychotic, the action is kinetic, the conflicts and pressures on rancher Dan Evans are palpable. Though the original was considered a modern "adult" western half a century ago, its heart now beats a whole lot faster, and so does ours.
 
 While that original was ballyhooed as "in the tradition of the screen's biggest outdoor dramas," a lot of it focused on the psychology of men waiting in the tiny town of Contention, wondering if the train to Yuma was going to be on time and what would happen when it got there. Mangold has chosen to open up the story and give himself the opportunity to shoot in the wide open spaces of New Mexico by adding, among other elements, those fierce Apaches and a sequence involving Chinese workers laying transcontinental railroad track.
 
 Given that the director works especially well with actors -- both Angelina Jolie in "Girl, Interrupted" and Reese Witherspoon in "Walk the Line" won Oscars -- it's to be expected that Mangold gets strong performances from both his stars as well as his supporting cast.
 
 It's Bale as rancher Evans we encounter first, coping with the woes of Job. In addition to being hobbled by a Civil War injury, Evans gets no respect from anyone in his life. His cattle are dying because of drought, his mortgage holder is trying to force him off the land, his wife, Alice (Gretchen Mol), is regretful, and Will, his surly 14-year-old son (Logan Lerman in a role considerably beefed up from the original), considers him as weak as green tea. When Alice says to him, "No one will think less of you," Evans snaps back, "No one can think less of me." Ouch.
 
 Outlaw legend Ben Wade (Crowe), a man who would as soon kill you as look at you, is, by contrast, at the top of his game. He robs stagecoaches at will (21 at last count), his word is law as far as his vicious gang of miscreants is concerned and he is much comforted by the biblical verse he is fond of quoting: "Every wicked man is right in his own heart."
 
 Only the long arm of coincidence has the strength to connect these two men, but connect they do, and Evans' desperate need for money puts him on a posse of men, headed by gruff Pinkerton agent Byron McElroy (an expert, almost unrecognizable Peter Fonda), who are determined to get Wade to the town of Contention and on that aforementioned train to the federal penitentary in Yuma.
 
 It's no stretch to see Crowe embracing the role of a cocky, seductive outlaw, the unlikely sophisticate who enjoys playing manipulative mind games with everyone in sight, but he does so with so much brio that his performance shines. The actor himself apparently feels the same way: In the film's closing credits, the name "Ben Wade" frequently appears where Crowe's would ordinarily be.
 
 If Crowe is a treat all the way through, Bale's performance improves as the film progresses and his character toughens under pressure. A master of grim, humorless determination, Bale is one of the few actors equally believable as weak and downtrodden and heroic. Though the film's finale feels a trifle too worked over, its chase elements pump enough adrenaline to make up for it.
 
 Finally, a word must be said about Ben Foster, whose portrait of psycho in chief Charlie Prince, resplendent in double-breasted leather jacket with brass buttons as Wade's No. 2, is one of "3:10 to Yuma's" signature elements. Foster's gleeful villainy owes more than a little to Lee Marvin in "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance," but everything about this energetic film owes something to somebody, and that turns out to be not a bad thing at all.
 

 
 "3:10 to Yuma." MPAA rating: R for violence and some language. Running time: 1 hour, 57 minutes. In general release.   

How do you get an audience today to line up for that most traditional  some would say stodgy and irrelevant  of genres, the Western? It helps to pile on the good humor and the star power (Silverado ), or to reconfigure the conflict of cowboys and Indians into a misty-eyed New Age lovefest (Dances With Wolves ). In the case of 3:10 to Yuma , a sturdy and enjoyable remake of the 1957 minor classic (the original was based on a short story by Elmore Leonard, and it has his affection for sleazy good-bad men), director James Mangold (Walk the Line ) amps up the mayhem, going for his version of a Peckinpah frenzy. As the picture opens, an armored coach gets ambushed by a very wild bunch of outlaws, a scene that's staged like the whiz-bang prelude to an urban action movie: the camera bouncing and jostling from a horseman's-eye view, the bullets fired from everywhere, the Pinkerton agents who are guarding the coach's payload leaping to unleash their fire with a primitive machine gun.
This is no tightly choreographed Old West shoot-out; it's a fusillade of hot-lead chaos. Yet for all the sprayed metal on display, the violence in 3:10 to Yuma  is really a come-on, a strategy to suck in sensation junkies. The film's real duel is a psychological one, a shoot-out of values between two powerfully different men. There's Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), the self-possessed outlaw who, having robbed that stagecoach, gets captured, almost as a fluke, by a nervous posse of small-town  enforcers; and there's Dan Evans (Christian Bale), the self-doubting, impoverished family man who, for $200, joins the posse to help deposit Wade on the 3:10 train to Yuma prison. That is, if Wade's gang doesn't catch up and kill everyone first.
Russell Crowe's career may have hit a speed bump, but I'm still convinced he's the star of our time. He makes masculine anger noble, investing it with the black-hat mystique of someone who has grown wise by doing ignoble things. It's that saint/bruiser complexity that's so commanding. Just look at Crowe's eyes: The left one is steady, centered, square in intent, but the right one is all squinty, off-kilter attitude. As the deadly, elegant sharpshooter Wade, whom Glenn Ford played in the original with a dimply corporate lethality, Crowe carves out his own relaxed space, and then molds the movie to it. He makes the character an aesthete (he's always sketching things), a Bible-quoting gentleman . He's so courteous that at first you think he's being ironically nice. Then you realize he means it. Wade has been a criminal for so long, and holds himself so far above ordinary folks, that he actually has pity for them. He doesn't want to kill Evans, a debt-ridden rancher who lost part of his leg in the Civil War. He wants to escape by buying him off  and, in the process, giving the weaker man a taste of personal power. He's a bow-lipped Nietzschean in a black vest.
Wade keeps taunting Evans, tempting him, and with each new offer the hollows in Evans' cheeks seem to sink a little deeper. In the 1957 3:10 to Yuma , Evans was played by Van Heflin as a sad, disheveled lug  the battle between the two men was mythological  but 50 years later it's a far more exotic thing in movies to bring a desperate working stiff to life, especially if you're a high flier like Christian Bale. He makes Evans a real Method scraggle-puss: all scowling impotence and hardened pride, his eyeballs burning out of that gaunt face. What gives the story its kick is that Wade, the courtly sociopath, is free to do the things he thinks everyone secretly wants to do, whereas Evans, with a wife (Gretchen Mol) who has turned cool to him and a teenage son (Logan Lerman) who doesn't respect him, is drowning in quiet misery. He's honorable, but is he a man?
The original 3:10 to Yuma  was a ticking-clock Western. Like High Noon  or Rio Bravo , it was all sitting around in enclosed spaces waiting for the big showdown. The new version follows the old one fairly closely, but it pads close to half an hour onto it, adding a skirmish with Indians, goosing the action (ironically) by slowing down the story, giving a showboat role to Ben Foster as Wade's feral, cracked right-hand gun. The climax, in which Evans drags Wade around buildings and across rooftops, firing at a dozen enemies at once, is genuinely exciting, but it also goes on forever, and given what a major point the movie makes of Evans' ruined leg, it begs plausibility. This is how a Western today tries to give us more bang for the buck. By working this hard to be a crowd-pleaser, though, it may please fewer crowds.

 Correction Appended  Russell Crowe, who wears the black hat in “3:10 to Yuma,” is a native of New Zealand. Christian Bale, the good guy, was born in Wales. Lou Dobbs and other commentators who have lately been sounding the alarm about outsourcing, immigration and the globalization of the labor market may want to take note. The hero and the villain in a cowboy movie: are we going to stand by and let foreigners steal these jobs? Are no Americans willing to do them?  Of course the western is a universal genre — one of the best recent examples, “The Proposition,” comes from Australia — and it must be said that Mr. Crowe and Mr. Bale both do excellent work. They and a fine, all-American supporting cast, including Gretchen Mol, Ben Foster, Dallas Roberts and a surpassingly grizzled Peter Fonda, are the main reasons to see “3:10 to Yuma,” a serviceable addition to the current western revival.  Directed by James Mangold from a script by Halsted Welles, Michael Brandt and Derek Haas, “3:10 to Yuma” remakes a 1957 film of the same title (based on the same Elmore Leonard story), which starred Glenn Ford as the charming baddie and Van Heflin as the rancher who risks everything to escort him to a rendezvous with justice.  The original, directed by Delmer Daves, is a lean and satisfying specimen, a western more concerned with the psychology of its characters than with the mythology of the frontier. Mr. Mangold’s new version, though it expands the story and cranks up the brutality, does its best to honor the unpretentious spirit of the original.  If it is a lesser movie —  more likely to be recalled as a moderately satisfying entertainment than remembered as a classic —  that may be a sign of the times. The best of the old westerns were dense with psychosexual implication and political subtext. Often dismissed, then and now, as naïve celebrations of dubious ideals, they were in many ways more sophisticated than their self-consciously critical (or “revisionist”) heirs. And the new “3:10 to Yuma,” even in its efforts to stick to the old ways (apart from some obligatory post-“Deadwood” cussing), is neither spare nor suggestive enough. It lacks the confidence to distinguish between touchstones and clichés.  But the principal actors are nonetheless able to refresh their somewhat shopworn roles. Dan Evans, Mr. Bale’s character, is a former sharpshooter in the Union Army trying to survive bad weather and predatory capitalism in the post-Civil War Arizona territory. Mr. Bale is one of the few screen actors who can convincingly shed the trappings of modernity. Dan is much more than a movie star in costume: with his gaunt, haggard face and wide, awe-struck eyes, he seems to have stepped out of a daguerreotype or a murder ballad.  Ben Wade, the prodigious robber played by Mr. Crowe, is a more familiar creature:  a sociopath whose twinkly charm masks both his ruthlessness and his perverse integrity. Ben is better-humored than Dan, and he certainly looks better fed. He sweet-talks Dan’s wife (Ms. Mol) and impresses Dan’s older son (Logan Lerman), who regards his father’s ineffectual uprightness with open contempt.  Dan signs on with the ragged, righteous entourage whose job is to take Ben over the mountains and put him on the train that gives the movie its title. It’s not an easy commute. Ben’s gang, led by his sadistic sidekick, Charlie Prince (Mr. Foster), is lying in wait, and there are plenty of other enemies as well, from angry Apaches to rival railroad tycoons. The West here is a Hobbesian realm where any two men will have at least three reasons to kill each other.  But Ben and Dan discover an unlikely bond, or at least some common enemies, and Mr. Bale’s haunted reticence plays well against Mr. Crowe’s roguish relish. Their characters open up a bit too much toward the end, in confessional moments that soften the clean, hard contours of the story and bring to the surface themes that would have been more interesting if they had been left half-buried.  Mr. Mangold, whose previous films include “Girl, Interrupted” and “Walk the Line,” is not the kind of director who indulges in stylistic showboating. The action sequences in “3:10 to Yuma” are effective and coherent, but it is ultimately the actors who carry the movie. The destination may be as familiar as the journey, but there are still some sights worth seeing along the way.  “3:10 to Yuma” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has graphic violence and a lot of profanity.

"3:10 to Yuma" is a tense, rugged redo of a film that was pretty good the first time around. Reinforced by a strong central premise, alert performances, a realistic view of the developing Old West and a satisfying dimensionality in its shadings of good and evil, James Mangold's remake walks a fine line in retaining many of the original's qualities while smartly shaking things up a bit. A Western these days needs to be more than a solid, unfussy programmer to break out of the pack commercially, but this Lionsgate release should be able to generate moderately good theatrical returns prior to a solid home entertainment life, where casual viewer curiosity will be well rewarded.
Russell Crowe may be the biggest name in the cast, but one curious sidelight of the project is that the author of the 1953 short story on which the original 1957 film is based, Elmore Leonard, reps far more of a draw now than he did half a century ago. Tightly focused yarn was at the time viewed as firmly in the Western-with-a-conscience camp of "High Noon," in which lawmen and ordinary citizens alike were tested by their willingness to confront the evil in their midst.
Unlike in "High Noon," however, the man putting himself on the line here is not a sheriff or marshal, but a lame rancher whose life and family are just one bad season from coming apart at the seams. In the first of many tight, anxious scenes fraught with violence or the threat of it, the barn of Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is set afire. But Dan's vow of vengeance falls on deaf ears; so seemingly ineffectual has he become that his wife (Gretchen Mol) and older son Will (Logan Lerman) differ only in the degrees of their loss of faith in him.
In a subsequent bracing scene, a wild bunch led by the dapper Ben Wade (Crowe) attacks a payroll coach with a Gatling gun. Numerous bloody deaths ensue, but so does a big payoff for Ben, who, after his men take off, tarries too long with a luscious barmaid (Vinessa Shaw) in a nearby town and is arrested with Dan's help.
Although tempted to kill the notorious outlaw on the spot, local authorities prudently decide to turn him over the feds for official hanging. This, however, will involve transporting him to the railway town of Contention, where in two days' time, Ben can be put on the train to Yuma. To pay off his debt, Dan volunteers to help escort Ben to his destination.
Thus begins a war of nerves that plays out in tasty ways across a vivid landscape. Although handcuffed and surrounded by several armed men, it's Ben who sets the tone and exerts the power. Quoting Scripture when it suits the occasion, he elicits information with seemingly innocuous questions, taunts his guards, and baits Dan about his missing leg and inability to support his family or please his beautiful wife. An excellent judge of character and master manipulator, he manages to kill one, then another of his guards, and is on the verge of getting away when who should turn up in a pinch but young Will, who wants to help his dad but harbors an ill-concealed admiration for the charismatic bandit.
As the diminishing group proceeds through renegade Apache territory and into a mountainous railway construction site, they are shadowed by Ben's remaining gang, headed in his absence by his No. 2, the psychopathic Charlie Prince (Ben Foster). If anyone's going to gain the most, career-wise, from "3:10 to Yuma," it will definitely be Foster, who puts the kind of indelible imprint on this juicy role that, in earlier eras, allowed such thesps as Lee Marvin, Richard Boone, Dan Duryea, James Coburn, Jack Palance, Lee Van Cleef, Strother Martin and others to immortalize themselves in the annals of Western villainy.
With his albino coloring, pinched mouth, reedy voice and remorseless wall-eyes, Foster's lightning-draw killer brandishes a dementia amplified by an intense loyalty to Ben that gently borders on homoeroticism; he'll do anything for his boss, for some reasons that are clear and for some that must be intuited. Foster is a mad delight to watch, and a reminder that the relative scarcity of Westerns deprives a generation of character actors of opportunities to shine.
Eventually, the few surviving wayfarers wind up in Contention to await the train. The least satisfying aspect of the original film -- which was confidently directed by Delmer Daves and written by Halsted Welles, who receives shared script credit here with Michael Brandt and Derek Haas -- was the ending, which wrapped things up too thoroughly. Conclusion has been significantly altered here, with an eye toward more complex layering of emotion and meaning. But qualms persist, as aspects of the physical action and psychological motivation remain murky and forced.
All the same, "Yuma" provides an absorbing ride, with helpful contributions from all hands. Honoring tradition in the storytelling but pushing for a heightened visual realism, Mangold has lenser Phedon Papamichael thrust the camera right into the action with a lot of handheld and perspective shots that must keep pace with constantly mobile characters, horses and coaches. Michael McCusker's cutting and the clangy, propulsive score by Marco Beltrami keep a cattle prod on the proceedings.
Crowe is completely in his element here as, in the best tradition of great stars, he betrays no effort in conveying the masculine confidence, psychological acuity and manipulative power of his alluring bad guy; his Ben is one slick customer and more. Bale, whom one can imagine being effective in his own way as the villain, well embodies the strengths and frailties of the Eastern-bred rancher without sentimentality, and Lerman earns notice as a kid ready to skip adolescence and burst into full-blown manhood. Supporting turns are vivid, including a wonderfully leathery characterization by Peter Fonda as a supremely tough old bounty hunter.

Huffing and puffing to resuscitate a long-moribund genre, James Mangold  manages to imbue a 50-year-old western with the semblance of life. Mangold's remake of 3:10 to Yuma   isn't as startling a resurrection job as his Johnny Cash  biopic, but it does send a saddlebag full of western tropes skittering into the 21st century.
The 1957 original 3:10 to Yuma newly remastered for DVD in conjunction with the remakewas an "adult" western, shot in black-and-white with a pair of second-tier stars, Glenn Ford  and Van Heflin , as the charismatic outlaw and the beleaguered cattle rancher reincarnated in the remake by Russell Crowe  and Christian Bale . Suspense trumped violence and chin music rivaled fisticuffs (much of the movie was confined to a single hotel room) as the rancher, not altogether willingly, assumed responsibility for ensuring that the outlaw boarded the train to the federal pen at Yuma.
Based on a story by Elmore Leonard , 3:10 to Yuma  had an obvious kinship to High Noon , which appeared five years earlier. In both, a lone citizen is pitted against an insouciant criminal (and his gang), as well as confounded by a social order too craven to defend itself: The various moral issues are subsumed in the 11th Commandment that a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. If 3:10 to Yuma  lacked High Noon 's stripped-down drama, it strove for additional psychological complexity in contrasting two American types: the stolid working-stiff everyman and the charming hipster sociopath. In one of its most resonant bits, Yuma  juxtaposes Heflin's dutiful marriage with Ford's passionate seduction of a lonely barmaid.
Mangold sticks close to the 1957 version but, given an extra half-hour in which to play, opens up the original scenario to include a run-in with hostile Apaches and an interlude involving the construction of the train tracks. The railroad, as personified by corporate official Dallas Roberts , is the real villain, indifferent to anything other than property value. "Notice he didn't mention all the lives I've taken," Crowe remarks when he is first arrested and Roberts recites the litany of his crimes. Crowe's second-in-command (vividly played by Ben Foster ) may be a sadistic nut job, but Crowe is a courtly gent with the soul of an artist. (Also the chops, as evinced by his post-coital sketch of the barmaid's naked back.) When a captor insults his mother, he chalks his vengeance up to chivalry: "Even bad men love their mamas."
Back in the day, America used the western to ponder certain thingsamong them the nature of right and wrong and the basis of the social contract. Mangold's movie is certainly louder in its ruminations than Delmer Daves 's. Like, how does a man get to be a man? The key conflict isn't even between Bale and Crowe, but between the ineffectual rancherwho is not only hobbled by debt, but by a leg wound suffered as a Union infantrymanand his 14-year-old son (Logan Lerman ). All it takes is one look at Dad's floppy hat, compared to Crowe's stiff-brimmed derby, to grasp the depth of the son's shame.
Mangold is always willing to crank up the volumeand not just in his use of Freudian symbols. The opening stagecoach robbery is mega-ballistic: The coach has a Gatling gun, and a shotgun fired by one of Crowe's gang packs a bazooka's incendiary wallop. The ongoing body count dwarfs that in the original; the townspeople here are an even scurvier lot. The climactic final shoot-out unfolds in a virtual war zonewhich is not inapt, actually, in view of Bale's revelation regarding the origin of his wound.
Even blown up out of proportion, this story still works. What's lost in Mangold's rough-hewn exercise in barroom-brawl baroque is the original one-on-one. Much of the original consists of the outlaw testing and tempting his captors, the rancher in particular; by distributing Bale's burden among the other characters and emphasizing Crowe's physical prowess over his mental craftiness, Mangold weakens the tale's moral structure. The original's argument becomes purely situational hereper the dictates of contemporary ADD entertainment, moral judgment is always in the moment.
For all his heavy lifting, Mangold can be a sensitive director of actorsor at least a skillful one, having coaxed Oscar-winning performances out of kewpie dolls Reese Witherspoon  and Angelina Jolie  (Girl, Interrupted ). Crowe may be overly familiar as the charming outlawit's a straightforward turn, without the crooked smile or shifty menace that Ford brought to the partbut here, even more than in Rescue Dawn , Bale makes a credibly determined action hero, with Lerman notably unself-conscious as his angry son.
The movie's best performance, however, belongs to Peter Fonda . Tough, terrific, and totally unrecognizable as a bounty hunter, this cantankerous old hippie is so leathery he deserves his own line of rawhide apparel. Maybe, if the western ever does come back, he'll get a movie of his own.
