United by blood, rope and a serious adrenaline addiction, Thomas and Alexander Huber run up rocks the way some of us run up credit cards — rapidly, fearlessly and with little regard for consequences. When we join them, these gnarly German risk fiends are in Yosemite National Park  trying to break the speed-climbing record for the 3,000-foot face of El Capitan known as the Nose. Regular climbers average three to five days for the ascent; the brothers are aiming for two and a half hours. “It’s a trip,” comments Chongo, a former climber whose eyes suggest more than a passing acquaintance with the term. Far above him the Hubers scurry sideways like long-haired spiders, navigate tiny pitons and air their fears and sibling rivalries. Sometimes they fall, and the camera coyly turns its attention to tumbling rocks, leaving us to ponder the marketability of an extreme sports movie without extreme accidents. Looking backward, forward and within, “To the Limit” offers vertigo-inducing vistas (including picturesque detours to the Bavarian Alps and Patagonia), daredevil camerawork and a frustrating lack of personal background. (It’s left to the press notes to inform us that Thomas plays in a rock band and that Alexander is a  physicist.) Yet this disorienting, dippy documentary makes one thing abundantly clear: for the Hubers, the toughest climb may be into their own heads.

Taking auds where its title promises, "To the Limit" is a visually breathtaking essay about daredevils hooked on the thrill of speed rock-climbing. Focusing on renowned German team Thomas and Alexander Huber, helmer Pepe Danquart ("Hell on Wheels") sends extreme sports buffs to heaven and keeps general viewers engaged by placing his cameras in positions as perilous as those of his subjects. Docu grossed a tidy $1.5 million in limited German release and has niche potential elsewhere. Tube and ancillary prospects are sky-high.
"An assault against common sense," is how Alexander Huber describes the feats for which he and brother Thomas have become famous. The duo are shown training for a record-breaking assault on the El Capitan peak in California's Yosemite National Park. The 3,000-foot ascent takes most mortals three days to complete: These guys aim to scamper up in 2� hours. Producing you-are-there excitement reminiscent of "Touching the Void," "Limit" is nimbly balanced with insights into the appeal of this death-defying pursuit and gradual revelations about the siblings' intense professional rivalry. Vibrant, eclectic score by Christoph Israel and Dorian Cheah rounds out a first-class tech package.

As Pepe Danquart 's cheerfully lunatic To the Limit  begins, a camera takes in the majestic expanse of Yosemite National Park , gently gliding not just to the edge of a cliff, but over  it. What? While not quite great filmmaking, To the Limit  is daring enough to appeal to more than just the usual extreme-sports junkies. In profiling the brothers Huber—Alexander  and Thomas, Germans who look like Guns 'N' Roses roadies—Danquart and his team of "extreme cinematographers" take as many risks as their subjects: Not content to simply endanger their lives climbing stark precipices, the Hubers are addicted to speed-climbing, an even less safe variant that finds adrenaline rushes in going up perpendicular rocks as fast as possible. The usual extremist blather aside—"If life didn't have risk, it wouldn't be real," non-explains one climber—To the Limit  is equal parts breathtakingly daring rock-climbing footage and family psychodrama. The brothers have good reason to squabble: Thomas introduced his younger brother to the sport, then watched as Alexander seized all the high-profile glory and sponsorships. Still, they're a great team, and the extreme-sports formula never overshadows the Hubers' endearing relationship. Practicing their climb, Thomas yells for motivation: "Good Alexander! Like a little chamois!"
