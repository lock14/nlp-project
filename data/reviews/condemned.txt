Ten death row inmates from Third World prisons. One South Seas island. Thirty hours. Twenty ounces of plastic explosives strapped to various legs. Two screenwriters. One retired wrestler (Austin, no longer �Stone Cold�). One impalement. Two rapes (one attempted, one offscreen but audible). $49.95 for Internet subscribers to watch it all on a reality series produced by one Hollywood slimeball (Mammone). Millions tune in. Two others: a crazy Special Forces motherfucker (Jones) and the high-minded producer�s girlfriend (Mussett), who balks at the show. One FBI agent (Luke Pegler) who won�t drop the case, even when ordered. And dozens of explosions, approximately one per every six minutes of screen time. In between, an earnest newswoman (Angie Milliken) asks us to please think of the children, and someone or another remarks on how violent entertainment wouldn�t sell to millions of people if they weren�t bloodthirsty bastards, and aren�t we really all to blame? Then writer/director Wiper cuts back to a scene of torture he�s devised for us. It�s as effective an indictment of electronic voyeurism as Sliver
. Those intentions aside, The Condemned
 isn�t terribly effective as an actioner, either, despite a certain promise latent in its island-prison premise. Wiper doesn�t exploit the possibilities of his setting, so the only conflict is the fighting; the only suspense comes from waiting for the next character to pop out from behind a tree and do something possibly interesting. The Japanese prisoner (Masa Yamaguchi) can do a sort of cartwheel in place, which is cool, but mostly he just sneers, being the Japanese prisoner. Several fight sequences are shot handheld, which has the effect of obscuring the choreography, and they�re terribly chopped up into an MTV montage. Meanwhile, Austin�s soft-spoken but tough mien (�Get yourself together,� he tells a man with a broken leg who�s just seen his wife raped and murdered) needs more of a hook for the big screen, and Wiper isn�t giving it to him. The guy who ends up the star is Hoffman, as a wisenheimer co-producer � unlike much else in the movie, he�s got personality.


Nobody rooting for the movie career of "Stone Cold" Steve Austin , the big, swaggering professional wrestler, wants to hear that his debut vehicle, "The Condemned ," is execrable. So those people will have to stop reading, because it is.
And in the worst ways, too. For one thing, Austin is barely in it. For another, it tells us that the senseless carnage we're watching is itself indecent. It tells us this while showing a man rake another's eyes until they bleed and giving us two scenes of near sexual assault on a woman.
In the movie, which is a production of Austin's employer, the WWE , a reality- TV producer wrangles together 10 people on death row from all over the world (terrorists, rapists, murderous bank robbers) to star on a show he's airing on the Internet from an undisclosed island. Viewers are expected to pay $49.95 to watch for 30 straight hours as these 10 kill each other. (Nine, actually; the Italian is impaled on a spike of rock before the game even starts.)
At the 30th hour, the last inmate standing goes free. The unlucky have been bludgeoned, shot, or detonated courtesy of a bracelet strapped to each contestant's ankle, which can be manually set off by other contestants. The producer's cynical thinking goes: If you like "Survivor " or "Lost ," you'll probably love this. (His monomaniacal self-justifications bear an unfortunate resemblance to those of the disturbed Virginia Tech killer.)
The movie, of course, lacks the intelligence to make that kind of cynicism mean anything. This is not a satire of reality television or a prediction that we'll watch all of our TV on computers (even if that's true). It's a sadistic grindhouse flick that feels the need to justify its sadism by moralizing against it. Please. If as a moviemaker you're compelled to give us a woman blowing up a man who's just confessed that women always betray him, go ahead. We can take it. But having things both ways is dubious, especially when your most reasonable moralizer is also your biggest psycho contestant. Former soccer brute Vinnie Jones plays the part.
"The Condemned" lasts almost two hours, and you can feel every minute, as the FBI tries to figure out where the show is taking place and as too-few crewmembers start to turn mutinous on the admittedly loathsome producer, played by Robert Mammone .
Through it all, Austin's character, the putative hero, a loner named Conrad who's been scapegoated onto death row (by our government!), demonstrates relative indestructibility. Austin himself is more interesting on a big screen than John Cena and Kane , Austin's fellow WWE stars who've had movies come out in the last year. He has a tough but pliable Texas drawl that makes even the dumbest lines sound witty. You'd almost like to hear him follow a Hugh Laurie acceptance speech with his own. Not likely, but still.
Incidentally, for $49.95 a viewer could also skip the Internet show and just watch Austin on "WrestleMania " instead, avoiding the shower this movie leaves you wanting.


         Stone Cold Steve Austin leaps from pro wrestling into more traditional sadism in "The Condemned." This product of WWE Films perhaps signals that organization's move from the world of fantasy into scarier "reality" fare.
 
 A zillionaire collects 10 hard cases from death rows around the world (how about that, even "Running Man" rip-offs are being outsourced), throws them together on an island, and tells them to start a-killin' because the sole survivor will be freed. And it's a live-as-it-happens, pay-per-view Web cast.
 


         






   There's an author's message here, radiating harebrained hypocrisy: Shame on you and your voyeurism!
 
  Isn't it awful that some people want to see necks broken like this — and helpless people pummeled like this — and women brutalized like this?
 
 Much of the action is shot via motion-sickness cam. But when there's torture, the lens steadies, so we can drink it all in, the blood, sweat and tears. There are moments of entertaining apoplectic rage and laugh-out-loud sermonizing: "Those of us who watch — aren't we the condemned?"
 
 "Condemned" is, if nothing else, an object lesson in how to punish women for fun and profit. But it's all for a point, the filmmakers would have us believe. One suspects that's a point of sale.
 
 And that's reality.
 
 
"The Condemned." MPAA rating: R for pervasive strong brutal violence, and for language. Running time: 1 hour, 40 minutes. In general release.
 
 
   

 Tailor-made for those who like their violence multifaceted and their women monosyllabic, “The Condemned” tosses a selection of action movies— “Con Air,” “The Running Man,” “Series 7: The Contenders” — into a blender and serves up the resulting mush. A simpleminded vehicle for the wrestling star Steve Austin, the movie will slide into foreign markets with no need for elaborate subtitles or cultural translation. The language of pain is universal.  As Jack Conrad, one of 10 musclebound lowlifes extracted from Third World prisons by an Internet reality show and forced to fight to the death on a desert island, Mr. Austin displays the acting ability of a tranquilized tree stump. Dredging his few lines from a neck like a heifer’s midsection, Jack fights to stay alive and dreams of his girlfriend back home. Little does he know she’s in a Texas bar, following his every live-streamed move.  Leaden and inept, “The Condemned” is unable to deliver even the action goods, presenting every fight scene in such quaking, extreme close-up it’s difficult to tell who’s pummeling whom. And as one character lectures on the ethics of broadcasting heavily manipulated violence, it’s clear the producers, World Wrestling Entertainment, are as ignorant of irony as they are of filmmaking.  “The Condemned” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has explicit language, exploding body parts and expletory moralizing.

As the first bigscreen starring vehicle for World Wrestling Entertainment star "Stone Cold" Steve Austin, "The Condemned" offers yet another reheating of "The Most Dangerous Game," distinguished only by an already stale reality angle and some of the thickest necks in showbiz. Pic aims for nonstop thrill ride, but for all its brainless brawn, it has plenty of stops and few real thrills. In line with that of prior WWE feature productions, hardtop biz is likely to be modest, with core auds checking in en masse once it's available as a slow night's rental.
Young Turk media tycoon Ian Breckel (Robert Mammone) has hit on a must-see-TV concept too hot for actual nets: dropping 10 death-row inmates from Third World prisons on a remote island, where only the last one alive will gain freedom and a fat purse. For the sake of a "good show," they are heavily encouraged to kill each other. If they fail to do so, after 30 hours, their explosive-rigged ankle bracelets will kill them anyway.
Needless to say, the top-secret location (in Papua New Guinea, though Australia's Gold Coast actually plays the part) has been covered with vidcams to capture the "action," which will stream live over the Internetat $49.99 per "subscriber." Breckel expects to exceed the Super Bowl's roughly 40 million annual viewers.
Ensconced in their compound on one side of the isle -- well away from the killers, though naturally not for long -- are Breckel and his crew. Most are as giddily conscience-free as he is, though his girlfriend (Victoria Mussett) and tech director Goldman (Rick Hoffman) do grow sickened by the "live snuff film" he's orchestrated.
He justifies this cynical spectacle by calling the contestants torturers, murderers, rapists and terrorists who were due for execution anyway. But their backstories are noted so fleetingly it's impossible to absorb more than the fact that some appear clearly crazy and/or malevolent, while a few seem to be sympathetic victims of injustice. Chief among the latter are young Mexican spouses Paco and Rosa (Manu Bennett and Dasi Ruz); Kreston (Marcus Johnson), a drug dealer arrested in Malaysia; and Conrad (Austin), a redneck sprung from a Central American hellhole where he was doing time on murky charges.
Several hasty alliances are created, the most merciless between martial-arts killing machine Saiga (Masa Yamaguchi) and disgraced ex-Brit Special Forces roughneck McStarley (Vinnie Jones).
Time that would have been better spent developing atmosphere and suspense on the island is instead expended on gratuitous Stateside scenes with FBI investigators and Conrad's worried single-mom g.f. (Madeleine West). There is some nastiness (unfortunately visited on the most likeable characters), not much gore (the R rating seems primarily due to cursing) and a lot of bombast. Publicity makes much of the film's eschewing CGI; digital fakery has become so omnipresent that it's refreshing to see action (like Zoe Bell's carhood-clinging stunts in Quentin Tarantino's "Death Proof") that is palpably, humanly possible. But helmer/co-scenarist Scott Wiper ("A Better Way to Die") blows that advantage by shooting all such segments in handheld jerky-cam shots that swing wilder than the protags' punches, making everything a fast-cut blur of motion.
Chrome-domed Austin (even his noggin looks like a bulging muscle) gives a glowering, one-note wrestling-machismo performance, barking lines that seldom stray from "F-you" terrain. Jones' soccer-hooligan act has been amusingly over-the-top before (notably in "EuroTrip" and two Guy Ritchie pics), but as a more conventional villain here, he's just OK. Other fighters are pretty much limited to making a visual impression, Yamaguchi and Bennett faring best; if the charismatic latter were the lead here, there'd be a lot more to root for.
Pic could use more humor, though it does have scattered unintentional laughs, particularly one late, solemnly admonishing speech about how those producing entertainment need to take responsibility for glorifying violence. Given the film's premise and WWE imprint, one might hope the filmmakers are having an ironic laugh, but no such self-awareness evinces itself in the script or direction.
Tech aspects are solid enough.
