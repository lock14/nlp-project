 It's unclear what exactly Peter Rosen's documentary "Who Gets to Call It Art?" is about, much less why it was made. Clocking in at 80 minutes, this glib, largely uninformative and poorly organized précis of the post-World War II art scene, with its emphasis on New York in the 1960's and the curator Henry Geldzahler, succeeds neither as history nor as art history. If you want to know about Geldzahler, who in 1960 became a curatorial assistant in the department of American painting and sculpture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (he died in 1994), you would do better if you typed his name into your favorite search engine. If you want to know about art in the 1960's, well, the art critic Arthur Danto is a good place to start.  A jumble of contemporary and, frustratingly, undated talking-head interviews, undated archival film material and still photographs, the film opens promisingly. The sculptor John Chamberlain growls about the public in what appears to be a fairly recent interview. ("What will the public think?" he asks, answering, "It's their job to catch up.") The painters Jasper Johns and Willem de Kooning offer up words of wit, wisdom and obfuscation from times past. The words "The Legend of Henry Geldzahler, 1935-1994" soon appears, as does the man himself, his full-moon face rising. Frank Stella attests to Geldzahler's importance, which isn't very surprising, since the curator included nine of the artist's works in his landmark 1969 show at the Metropolitan, "New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970."  The importance of that controversial blockbuster show  —  408 works by 43 artists in 35 galleries  —  is forcibly repeated in the documentary, but not satisfyingly explained. Such is the case with every idea and artist that rushes past. We learn that artists liked to drink at the Cedar Tavern, and we see Jackson Pollock (or is it Ed Harris?) executing some of his drip paintings. Times change, faces too: enter Pop Art and Andy Warhol, who befriended Geldzahler and once said (though not in this film) that the curator "gave me all of my ideas." David Hockney and Mark di Suvero also make appearances; oddly, the only female artist name- checked is Helen Frankenthaler. Eva Hesse, Lynda Benglis, Anne Ryan and Louise Nevelson, among others, remain missing in action, which certainly adds another layer of meaning to the documentary's title question.

Despite its confrontational, rabble-rousing title, "Who Gets to Call It Art?", Peter Rosen's docu about late Metropolitan Museum of Art curator Henry Geldzahler unfolds as parallel tributes to the cherubic iconoclast and to the movements he championed. Many credit Geldzahler's huge 400-piece exhibition, "New York Painting and Sculpture: 1940-1970," with establishing the cultural bona fides of post-WWII American art. Lively, intelligent collage, both richly complex and immediately accessible -- thanks to the openness of Geldzahler himself and to the passion with which a Rosenquist and Hockney is moved to speak of him -- seems a natural for arthouse release. 
Geldzahler was nobody's idea of a museum curator, and particularly not one in as traditionalist an institution as New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art. A rotund, antic muse, Geldzahler was just as likely to appear as an actor in an Andy Warhol movie or as the subject of a David Hockney portrait or as a component part, cum bathrobe and trademark cigar and floating on a rubber raft, of a Claes Oldenberg "happening" staged in a swimming pool.
A unusual curator who lived among the artists, spending all his time in galleries and studios, Geldzahler possessed a rare eye for beauty and an even rarer willingness to discover it in out-of-the-way places. His energetic optimism coincided well with the exuberant wit and daring of the Pop Art movements that succeeded the angst-ridden interiority of Abstract Expressionism.
A cornucopia of archival and contemporary footage, featuring a veritable "Who's Who" of painters and sculptors, from Jasper Johns to Frank Stella to John Chamberlain to James Rosenquist to Francesco Clemente, traces Geldzahler's intersections with the changing New York art scene. At the same time, like Zelig in Woody Allen's faux documentary footage, the image of Henry keeps appearing inside the art itself, in photographs by Avedon and Mapplethorpe, as a sculpted plaster likeness by George Segal, and as a phantom figure in countless paintings by Hockney, Clemente, et. al.
For helmer Rosen, Geldzahler represents the perfect jumping-off point for a discussion of shifting aesthetic theory and practice. Rosen effortlessly charts the tremendous changes in the art world in the tumultuous '60s as the zeitgeist moved from a small, marginal, poverty-embracing group of introverts to self-promoting, visionary interpreters of mass media to cynical purveyors of investments for big business.
The films' centerpiece is the triumphal takeover by brash upstart Americans of many 18th and 19th century galleries at the Met, the erstwhile bastion of timeless European art.
"Henry's Show," as the controversial exhibition came to be known (he alone, committee-less, personally handpicked each piece), definitively established New York City as center of the art universe. But the groundbreaking exhibition also planted the seeds for that very commodification that Warhol, Oldenberg or Lichtenstein so blithely mocked.
Tech credits are excellent, Rosen using all sorts of painterly techniques to enhance pic's heterogeneous mix of film elements.

Funny how once you've been in New York a few years, you might attend some party peppered with worthies, drink and jabber nonstop, then leave feeling like nothing very remarkable or exciting has transpired. Such is the experience of Peter Rosen 's Who Gets to Call It Art? , a well-stocked but underweight documentary about the life of legendary curator Henry Geldzahler , whose career spanned the rise and fall of Abstract Expressionism, Pop Art, and Minimalism, tail-ending in a stint as head of New York City's Department of Cultural Affairs. A TV-style compilation of big-name talking heads and occasionally fascinating footage, the film convokes an impressive cast of intervieweesDavid Hockney , Frank Stella , and Ellsworth Kelly  among themyet seems too dazzled by their luminance to squeeze a substantial analysis of Geldzahler from their pithy testimonials. Rosen opts instead for a moving-picture textbook chapter on the transition from AbEx to Pop, and poor Geldzahler, crowded out of his own documentary by the showboating Warhol clips, emerges with a barely sketched biography. Defaulting to the Austin Powers  theory of history, the film uses the curator as macguffin in the service of rehashing how the '60s were the craziest happening everI mean wild, baby, just wild! until the suits arrived and harshed everyone's vibe.
"The true school for the young artist," Geldzahler writes in the introduction to the catalog for his landmark Met exhibition "New York Painting and Sculpture: 19401970," "is the ferment and activity of the center, its multiplicity of styles and its complex traditions." Rosen's narrative appears to have been influenced by this very essay, chronicling art's evolution within these same dates as a Manhattan-centered phenomenon in which commercial galleries served as academies, auction houses as magnifiers, and institutional museums as kingmakers. Scion to Belgian diamond dealers, Geldzahler entered this world following an education at Yale  and Harvard . Rosen suggests that this background gave Geldzahler a keen eye for exquisite objects and a critical faculty for explicating difficult work; the former claim is possible, the latter unquestionable, but the more obvious fact that a child of the subsidized classes could consider an elite life-role as his birthright goes unspoken. Nor does the film get around to tackling the compelling curatorial question posed by its titlea conundrum thinkers from Lucy Lippard  to Arthur Danto  have spent careers pondering. Therein lies a major fault: The idea of art presented in the film appears frozen in a pre-revolutionary 1960. It is a world in which collector-unfriendly conceptualism, video art, and avant-garde film never happened; thus one interviewee scoffs at Warhol's movies (which include a 100-minute Geldzahler portrait) as "boring," and Rosen fails to credit films by Jonas Mekas  on-screen, as he does with James Rosenquist 's paintings. Surely a figure as crucial as Geldzahler deserves more incisive treatment. Who Gets to Call It Art?  may serve up a swinging party, but as Parker Tyler  opined when surveying the same era, "a thing may be groovy, but far from great."
