Barrymore�s directing debut, Whip It
, is a lot of fun, even though the film may be better known in these parts as �the one that got away.� Based on a screenplay about women�s Roller Derby by former Austinite Shauna Cross, Whip It
 was filmed in the extremely tax-incentive-friendly state of Michigan, instead of the Central Texas area in which the story is set and which has been so instrumental in the revival of women�s roller-skating. Be that as it may, Ann Arbor is not a bad stand-in for Austin, especially when supplemented with a few iconic exterior shots filmed here in the capital city. Teeming with girl-power spirit, Barrymore�s film exudes an all-encompassing benevolence rather than strident one-upmanship. These girls just want to have fun, even though their pleasure involves getting banged up and bruised to the roar of hot metal thunder beneath their feet. As the central character, Bliss Cavendar, Page demonstrates that her breakout performance in Juno
 was no fluke and that she has what it takes to carry a film. Bliss� story about slipping away from her sleepy Texas town and her beauty-pageant-mad mother (Harden) for the attraction of the rink contains more details than are sometimes necessary, but the effort helps make her journey believable. A subplot regarding a love interest is pure window dressing, though. The heart of the movie belongs to the Austin roller league, whose members play without regard to the outcome: They return for the thrill and satisfaction of the moment � and one another�s company. Barrymore�s casting choices are intrinsic to the success of the film. Lewis, under her rink name, Iron Maven, hasn�t had this meaty a role in maybe 15 years, while Wilson as the team�s shaggy male coach is a hoot to watch. Harden and Stern, as Bliss� parents, create fleshed-out characters instead of lazy depictions of the paper tigers that grown-ups usually are in teens� stories. Also smart on Barrymore�s part was snagging Robert D. Yoeman (Rushmore
) for her director of photography and Dylan Tichenor (Magnolia
) as her editor, both of whom help lend the film a crisp look that focuses on the contact part of the sport instead of the overall game. Barrymore is generous toward her actors and keeps her own endearing performance as klutzy Smashley Simpson in the background. Whip It
 wants to assure parents that they should not fear their daughters when the girls turn their interest in becoming Miss Texas into being Maggie Mayhem (Wiig�s rink name). And furthermore, Whip It
 reminds us that although new family allegiances will be formed once a girl leaves home, that doesn�t necessarily mean she has to leave the old family behind. That last one may carry more weight if you�re a Barrymore. (See "Tough Enough
," Oct. 2, for more.)


Once in a while, a moviemaker will find it in her heart to make my dreams come true. In Drew Barrymore’s “Whip It,’’ when Juliette Lewis starts a food fight with Ellen Page that turns into about a dozen giggling women rolling around on the floor of a diner covered in condiments, grease, and cream, the movie had won my heart. Did I know this was something I wanted to see? Not really. But the great bait-and-switch of the movies amounts to your dreams being replaced with a director’s. And who would have thought that director would be a woman who, in her next life, seems destined to come back as an energy drink?

Barrymore has so thoroughly laced “Whip It’’ with her own lunatic affections for women and the human race in general that it ought to be sold as an antidepressant. For her first film as a director she’s opted not to raid her past for a juicy Hollywood melodrama. She’s given us a roller derby comedy, adapted with intelligence, heart, fairness, and some wit by Shauna Cross from her novel “Derby Girl.’’ Page plays 
Bliss Cavendar, a tomboy dying to get out of a small Texas town whose obsessions  - football, beauty pageants, big hair  - don’t interest her. (Barrymore actually shot the film in Michigan.)

As it happens, her mother, Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden), has been grooming Bliss and her younger sister for the pageant world. You know this woman is deluding herself to think she could relive her beauty-queen days through a daughter who shows up for one contest with some of her hair dyed blue.

Page’s eye-rolling and sulking are straight out of “Juno.’’ But this part is something new for her. One afternoon Brooke takes Bliss to a thrift store in nearby Austin to buy a pair of combat boots, when three full-figured women come skating toward the register like tattooed angels from hipster heaven. Page’s face lights up in a way I’ve never seen. The angels leave behind flyers for a roller derby league, and without a lot of effort Barrymore and Page make you feel the earth move beneath this girl’s feet.

The rest of the movie is devoted to capitalizing on that excitement. Bliss and her best friend Pash (Alia Shawkat) pretend to Mr. Cavendar (an excellently dopey Daniel Stern) that they’re going to high-school football games. They’re actually sneaking over to Austin, where Bliss tries out for the league and winds up helping to turn around a losing outfit called the Hurl Scouts (“We’re number two!’’ they chant after one defeat). The team includes a single mom (Kristen Wiig) and a stoner Whole Foods clerk (Barrymore). The rapper Eve and the stuntwoman Zöe Bell are Hurl Scouts, too. Beyond their noms de skate (Barrymore’s is Smashley Simpson, Eve’s is Rosa Sparks, Page is Babe Ruthless), we don’t learn much about them individually. The point is they have great camaraderie.
The matches, which are staged on a canted track in an abandoned warehouse, aren’t terribly thrilling as athletic spectacles. (The object is to score points by passing other skaters.) But they’re entertaining. Jimmy Fallon emcees them, and he’s more charmingly louche here than he is on his new talk show, once showing up with giant foam cowboy hat on his head. “Clean up on aisle 5,’’ he quips after Smashley punches out a skater.

Barrymore probably overemphasizes the physical brutality. At one point Bliss goes down, and you’re worried we might have a “Million Dollar Baby’’ situation on our hands. But the spirit behind it is sincerely fun in a way that’s rarely the case in alternative-sports comedies like, say, “Dodgeball,’’ “Balls of Fury,’’ or the Will Ferrell movie of your choice. In any of those, Juliette Lewis, who plays a vamp named Iron Maven, would be the villain. Here she’s just charismatically competitive, as opposed to one-dimensionally heartless. Her harassment of Page is a show of respect: When will Bliss fight back? Right there with a dessert in that diner.

The movie’s central drama revolves around how Bliss will reconcile her mother’s wishes with her own. Will the cute, bamboo shoot of a boy (Landon Pigg) she meets in Austin break her heart? Can her friendship with the college-bound Pash survive Bliss’s small-time fame? These and other matters are resolved in nicely written, smartly acted sequences that show off Barrymore’s sharp instincts about how to orchestrate her very different performers. She has Harden and Wiig turn their muchness down, gives Shawkat enough to do so that the many folks who never saw her on “Ar rested Development’’ will feel they’ve made a robust comic discovery, and proves she has good taste in Wilson brothers, casting the shaggiest one, Andrew, to play the Hurl Scouts’ long-suffering coach.

Most crucially, Barrymore encourages Page to just let herself go. The sight of her making her way up residential streets in a pair of Barbie roller skates or screaming “Marco’’ in a game of Marco Polo is simply joyful. If American movies were full of stories about girls, their dreams, their mothers, their heartbreaks, their gift for smashing their elbows into people’s chins, “Whip It’’ would be just another happy comedy. But Hollywood is woefully short on such stories. I anticipate the day when a movie like this stops seeming like the antidote and more like the norm.

Because of a reporting error, the review of "Whip It" in the "G" section on Oct. 2 misstated a character's name. Ellen Page's best friend in the film is named Pash.




Whip It  suggests what might have happened if Juno had gone to a high school as poky as Napoleon Dynamite's and decided that although her mother wanted her to be a beauty queen like Little Miss Sunshine, she'd rather just strap on roller skates. Only here the petite, droll, feisty, Ellen Page-like heroine played by Ellen Page is named Bliss. And her idea of sass while chatting up a cute rocker (Landon Pigg) in this desexualized, slow-speed grrrl-power sports fantasy is "I'm Bliss, but I could change that."
Bliss does  change her name, at least at the Roller Derby rink. She sneaks away from her square parents (Marcia Gay Harden as the U.S. Postal Service's least likely mail carrier and Daniel Stern as a nice schlub who likes beer) to roll with a sisterly Austin team who call themselves the Hurl Scouts. There, she dubs herself Babe Ruthless, making up in speed what she lacks in muscled aggression. She's heck on wheels, or so we are asked to believe: The rink footage is pretty un-whippy.
Even Juliette Lewis, playing the film's   designated bad girl and Bliss/Babe's nemesis on the rink, is more of a cute bee-yotch than a real threat. The movie is Drew Barrymore's directorial debut (she also plays fellow Hurl Scout Smashley Simpson), and it's clear she's more attuned to grrrlishness than real   athletic power: Smashley is the first to scream ''Food fight!'' and the 34-year-old actress leads the charge in kidlike mayhem.

 Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) is a Texas teenager whose mother (Marcia Gay Harden) pushes her along the beauty-pageant circuit, shaking her head and pursing her lips at her daughter’s mild gestures of rebellion. But hair dye and punk rock are only the beginning. Bliss stumbles into the world of competitive women’s roller derby, which improves her self-esteem, brings her some new friends and must be kept secret from her parents. (Dad, played by Daniel Stern, is a laid-back, beer-drinking football fan in a household dominated by women.)  If you think you know exactly where this story is going, you’re right. “Whip It,” the directing debut of Drew Barrymore (who shows up now and then as one of Bliss’s big-hearted, hard-riding teammates) is predictable not only in the contours of its plot, but also in nearly every scene and situation.  Bliss’s roller-derby squad, the Hurl Scouts, is a bunch of underachieving misfits with a put-upon coach (Andrew Wilson). Do they suddenly start winning, making an improbable run for the championship? What do you think? Does Bliss have a falling out and a reconciliation with her loyal, flaky best friend (Alia Shawkat)? Does Bliss meet a dreamy boy (Landon Pigg) who plays in a rock ’n’ roll band? Does she learn valuable lessons, experience laughter and tears and grow as a person? Do you have to ask?  You might, nonetheless, want to see this movie, even — or maybe especially — if you have seen “Billy Elliot” or “Bend It Like Beckham.” Familiarity is not always a bad thing, and if the script, by Shauna Cross, piles sports movie and coming-of-age touchstones into a veritable cairn of clichés, the cast shows enough agility and conviction to make them seem almost fresh. (The skating action is also fun to watch, mixing hints of sex and violence without going too far toward either.)  Ms. Page, rotating the “Juno” cool-nerd archetype a few degrees in the nice girl direction of Molly Ringwald in “Sixteen Candles,” is smart, sharp and convincing. Bliss’s pluck is appealing, but the selfishness and insensitivity that are part of any adolescent’s self-defensive armory are also very much in evidence. And Bliss’s mother, Brooke, may start out as a caricature of prim, pathological femininity, but over the course of the movie she grows in interesting directions. The debutante fantasies that hover over her pageant fixation are not pretensions, but rather the aspirations of a tough, hard-working woman (Brooke is a mail carrier) who is ultimately more clued-in and more sympathetic than Bliss gives her credit for being.  Ms. Harden is also just about the only person in the movie, which was shot in Michigan, who sounds at all Texan. (Mr. Stern tries; no one else bothers.) Wherever we’re supposed to be, the revived subculture of roller derby, a cult sport whose rules are helpfully explained by a rink-side announcer played by Jimmy Fallon, comes to exuberant if somewhat fanciful life.  The athletes have tough-sounding pseudonyms (Bliss is called Babe Ruthless), tattoos and a lot of swagger, though their sisterly, sensitive sides have a way of peeking out from behind the sweat and grime. Among the other Hurl Scouts are the rapper Eve, the stunt performer Zoe Bell (who nearly drove away with Quentin Tarantino’s “Death Proof”) and Kristen Wiig, who seems to be battling Jason Bateman and Jonah Hill for a most ubiquitous supporting actor nomination. (They’re not in this one, by the way.)  The leader of the rival squad, Iron Maven, Bliss’s nemesis, is played by Juliette Lewis, whose scenes with Ms. Page have an extra dimension of pop-culture resonance, since Ms. Lewis was the Ellen Page of an earlier era. They settle it all in a big food fight, some rough-and-tumble skating throw downs and of course a girl-to-girl heart-to-heart.  “Whip It” has an easygoing spirit, a lightness of touch in spite of occasional excursions into melodrama, that makes it hard to mock and easy to like. It will not change the way you think about movies, roller derby or the relations between teenage girls and their mothers, friends or dreams. But it does invite you to stop and appreciate all those things.  “Whip It” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some sex and some mayhem, most of it good, clean fun.

Laced with good-natured hipster kitsch and endearingly goofy girl power, director Drew Barrymore's roller-derby dramedy, "Whip It," is a gas. In her contact-sporting debut feature, Barrymore hams it up as injury-prone skater "Smashley Simpson," but pays equal attention to all players in a lively femme-centered ensemble led by Ellen Page -- who, as blooming wallflower Bliss Cavendar (aka "Babe Ruthless"), finally has a role to match her star-making turn in "Juno." Young females will roll in the aisles, and in general B.O. prospects look zippy for Fox Searchlight's Oct. 2 release, particularly as the fall track appears overcrowded with weightier opponents.
Faithfully adapting her novel "Derby Girl," screenwriter Shauna Cross follows the basic rules of the coming-of-age movie, as punk-spirited Texas teen Bliss (Page) yearns to distinguish herself from old-school Mom and Dad (Marcia Gay Harden and Daniel Stern), who have her enrolled in cheesy, "Little Miss Sunshine"-style beauty pageants. When bespectacled Bliss, a waitress in a small-town BBQ joint, happens upon the rough-and-tumble world of women's roller derby, the discovery liberates not only her but the movie, which likewise finds its true calling on and around the track.
Hiding her age in order to try out for the Hurl Scouts, Bliss displays surprising speed even on her old Barbie skates and lands a coveted spot on the team, despite an initial reluctance to push and shove competitors -- the sport's raison d'etre, particularly for hooting fans.
Though Barrymore isn't much interested in mapping the spatial complexities of roller-derby action, her shooting of the games -- equal parts silly and violent -- is plenty visceral for these purposes. What distinguishes "Whip It" from the sports-film pack is the director's keen focus on the minutiae of team camaraderie, as Bliss learns to body-check opponents and is gradually accepted by her elder Hurl Scouts -- tough-as-nails chicks with self-styled Army-green getups and names like "Maggie Mayhem" (Kristen Wiig) and "Bloody Holly" (Zoe Bell, "Death Proof").
As coach of her own team, Barrymore has assembled a game crew of alt-film all-stars, including d.p. Robert Yeoman ("Rushmore"), editor Dylan Tichenor ("Magnolia") and ubiquitous music supervisor Randall Poster, whose soundtrack, ranging from the Ramones to the Breeders, matches the fast-rolling action hit for hit. Kevin Kavanaugh's production design captures working-class Texas marvelously, and Catherine Marie Thomas' costumes -- particularly the skaters' outfits, from helmets to fishnets -- are a hoot.
If "Whip It" seems to push its luck with a near-two-hour running time, it's a forgivable offense in the context of Barrymore's palpable desire to make the relationships resolve not just happily, but believably. Up to the climactic championship game (inconveniently held on the night of Mom's beloved Bluebonnet pageant), the movie's final third is a comprehensive series of lengthy two-handers between Bliss and various intimates: her intimidating rival (a rad Juliette Lewis), her fave teammate/confidante (Wiig), her overprotective mom, her cheerleading dad, her jealous best friend (Alia Shawkat), and her cute but untrustworthy beau (Landon Pigg). Remarkably, none of these dialogue-heavy scenes takes the easy way out.
Of course, sizable credit for the film's winning ways belongs to Page, whose performance -- complete with her own skating -- is one of grit, grace and speed. Acting far less precocious than she did in "Juno" and "Hard Candy," the young thesp takes a slight and welcome turn toward realism here, while hewing to the fancifully warm tone that is the movie's defining quality.
As if the emotional weight of a Hurl Scouts food fight weren't surprising enough, the end credits' cliched use of comedic bloopers feels downright poignant, as "Whip It" reluctantly takes leave of its lovably butt-kicking heroines -- at least until the sequel.

Drew Barrymore , making her directorial debut, is blunt on-screen and off- about her inspirations for this tale of an anguished debutante-turned-roller grrrl: Take a little bit of Peter Yates 's Breaking Away  (a teen townie trying to escape his humdrum existence and dad on a 10-speed), toss in Adrian Lyne 's Foxes  (bored suburban girls screwing and drinking to Boston and Donna Summer ), and add John Hughes 's Pretty in Pink   (good girl makes bad choice in boy) and a bit of George Roy Hill 's Slap Shot  (sports violence as metaphor for outsider's struggle). The only thing that keeps Barrymore's effort from playing like an American Movie Classics  rerun is the soundtrack, an alternarock all-skate to which Juno 's Ellen Page  goes 'round and 'round an Austin, Texas , roller-derby rink during her rather sudden rise from klutz-on-wheels to girl-power poster child. Page's beauty queen, Bliss Cavendar , is ultimately the least interesting character in the film—a more-good-than-bad youth in revolt clashing with an overbearing but well-meaning mom (Marcia Gay Harden ), a sweet but disinterested dad (Breaking Away 's Daniel Stern ), the best friend with big plans (Alia Shawkat ), and the mopey-dopey indie rocker who fucks her over (Landon Pigg , a singer-songwriter making his, um, acting debut). Highlights: Andrew Wilson  as the roller girls' coach (ah, so there's  the Wilson brother who can act) and the roller-derby vets (played especially well by Juliette Lewis  and Kristen Wiig ) about whom we learn just enough to wish the movie was focused on them instead.
