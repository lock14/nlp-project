Kusama, the director of 2000�s spunky Girlfight
, and Diablo Cody, the Oscar-winning screenwriter of 2007 sensation Juno
, combine forces in Jennifer�s Body
 in an attempt to infuse some girl power into their mash-up of cheeky horror films and teen-angst movies. The result is more mash than smash as Jennifer�s Body
 squanders its initial good will by failing to deliver the goods on either score. The scares are unconvincing and the overall teen scene too rote to sway us into believing that this Body
 is new and improved. The addition of Transformers
� vampy Fox as this film�s demonically possessed Jennifer is a stroke of � um� casting catnip, and the actress here demonstrates that she can deliver lines of dialogue as well as run sexily from robotic machinery. As Jen�s mousy best friend, Needy, Seyfried (Mamma Mia!
) creates a strong performance in a role that is confusingly written. Obviously crushing on her BFF (the prettiest girl in school, who, in the real world, wouldn�t be caught dead with Needy), she also has a boyfriend. The lesbian love interest is here used only for titillating effect, just as it is in male-focused narratives. Sure, Jennifer�s Body
 brims over with Cody�s hip and snappy dialogue, but clever references to Hello Titty and wetties instead of hard-ons are unable to carry the movie on their own. Without real scares, only intermittent laughs, and a trite flashback structure that narrates the movie via Needy�s perpetual voiceover, Jennifer�s Body
 is hardly robust.

The questions posed by the arch horror movie “Jennifer’s Body’’ include: Will there be a second chance for “Juno’’ screenwriter Diablo Cody? Does director Karyn Kusama deserve a third chance after the high of “Girlfight’’ in 2000 and the low of “Aeon Flux’’ in 2005? Can Megan Fox act?
The answers, in order, are: Probably not, yes, and lordy no.
The haters are already out in force for this one, storming the nation’s multiplexes with torches if their blogs are to be believed. Honestly, the movie’s not that
 terrible. That doesn’t mean it’s very good, though. “Jennifer’s Body’’ falls into the dispiriting category of dumb movies made by smart people, in this case a glibly clever writer and a talented director who think a few wisecracks are enough to subvert the teen horror genre.
Even “Heathers’’ couldn’t sustain intelligent malice across an entire movie, and that had Winona Ryder and
 Christian Slater. “Jennifer’s Body’’ stars Amanda Seyfried, who was in “Mamma Mia!,’’ and Fox, the “Transformers’’ poster-girl who’s as of this moment the most generic and least interesting sex object in the land. The upshot is a horror-comedy that’s not nearly funny enough and certainly isn’t scary.
The worst part is that the set-up is rich with snap, crackle, and kink, and the movie very occasionally delivers. Jennifer (Fox) is the reigning queen bee at Devil’s Kettle High School and Anita,  a.k.a. “Needy’’ (Seyfried), is her bespectacled best friend from childhood and current nerd-grrl acolyte. Needy still thinks she and Jennifer are on equal footing, but she’s about the only one. She does have a nice-guy boyfriend, though: Chip (Johnny Simmons), whose shaggy charm the movie needs more than Needy does.
Jennifer, by contrast, is a preening man-eater until an encounter with a Satan-worshiping indie rock band turns her into  - irony alert  - an actual man-eater: a pointy-toothed, demonically possessed succubus who lures the school’s stock boy types (jock, Goth, etc.) into the woods and eviscerates them for breakfast. Feeding makes Jennifer strong and indomitable (“and her hair is amazing
,’’ says Needy in one of the better lines). Without blood, she becomes a pallid, powerless nobody. There’s a decent metaphor for high school hierarchies there, but the movie mostly lets it lie.
Two things keep “Jennifer’s Body’’ from clicking: The script isn’t nearly as wonderful as it thinks it is, and Fox has the personality of a lukewarm Thermos. (A third: Kusama’s a solid director but not the wild-and-woolly stylist this project probably needs.) Cody tries to rocket her dialogue along at “Juno’’ pace, but sardonic glibness is hard to pull off when characters are going screaming to their deaths  - she should have either eased up on the gas or revved through to the far side of bad taste. Worse, the writer’s patented Cody-isms (“freaktarded,’’ “move on-dot-org’’) seem pushy and stale this time out.
The satanic indie band is a sharp satiric idea, though; Adam Brody plays the leader with the careerist cool the Strokes probably had early on. Seyfried is appealingly stressed, too, and the movie comes close to real transgression (as opposed to a jokey facsimile thereof) when an exultant Jennifer moves in on Needy for a long and hungry kiss. Suddenly “Jennifer’s Body’’ sparks with the heat and unease of an audience being pushed out of its comfort zone.
Then it loses its nerve, and the problem may lie with the movie’s leading lady. Because Fox has successfully been sold as a fantasy to millions of adolescent boys who have no idea what being with an actual woman is like, she lacks the individuality that would make Jennifer genuinely dangerous. True, the makeup crew turns her into a pretty good approximation of Shiva the Destroyer. At the end of the day, though, Fox is still Bambi the Boy Toy, and her movie hurts no one.

 “Jennifer’s Body,” a bloody high school demonic-possession serial-killer comedy written by Diablo Cody, directed by Karyn Kusama and starring Megan Fox in the title role, is an unholy mess.  I mean that as a compliment. Yes, the movie’s gory set pieces are executed with more carnivorous glee than formal discipline, and its story is as full of holes as some of its disemboweled victims. But coherence has never been a significant criterion for horror movies. If it were, we could forget about Dario Argento and Brian De Palma, half of Hitchcock and most of the entries in the “Friday the 13th” series. And though it is too soon to install “Jennifer’s Body” in that blood-soaked pantheon, the movie deserves — and is likely to win — a devoted cult following, despite its flaws.  These are mitigated by a sensibility that mixes playful pop-culture ingenuity with a healthy shot of feminist anger. Ms. Cody and Ms. Kusama take up a theme shared by slasher films and teenage comedies — that queasy, panicky fascination with female sexuality that we all know and sublimate — and turn it inside out. This is not a simple reversal of perspective; the girl’s point of view has frequently been explored in both maniac-on-the-loose thrillers and homeroom-to-prom-night romantic comedies. “Jennifer’s Body” goes further, taking the complication and confusion of being a young woman as its central problem and operating principle, the soil from which it harvests a tangle of unruly metaphors, mixed emotions, crazy jokes and ambivalent insights.  Jennifer, chilly, dark-haired and beautiful, is both the victim of male violence and a monster of indiscriminate vengeance, a ravening demon and an object of lust and longing. But always an object. The title of the movie is not “Jennifer’s Soul,” and from every angle she is a fantasy, a cipher, a figure in someone else’s fevered imagination. The inevitable critical sneering at Ms. Fox’s acting abilities will miss exactly this point. Her blunt, blank affect belongs to the character, not the performer, and is part of the film’s calculated tease. Ms. Kusama puts Ms. Fox’s lithe physique right in your face and then demands to know what you think you’re looking at.  Before a fateful run-in with an evil indie-rock band (led by Adam Brody) turns her into a bloodthirsty, bile-spewing succubus, Jennifer is the embodiment of a series of high school clichés that almost entirely obscure her inner life. She’s a mean girl, a bad girl, a popular girl, a dream girl — the one every other girl envies and every boy wants. But she is not the heroine of the movie, and it is not her predicament that makes it so interesting and original.  The real girl in the middle of this bloodbath — which overtakes a small town in Minnesota called Devil’s Kettle — is Needy, short for Anita. Played by Amanda Seyfried, she is Jennifer’s best friend, and if Ms. Fox brazenly incarnates teenage girl clichés, Ms. Seyfried slyly subverts them. Needy is sensible, studious and bespectacled, but hardly a nerd. She has a good-natured boyfriend named Chip (Johnny Simmons), and she seems generally well adjusted: curious about sex but not obsessed with it, adventurous but not reckless, prudent but not timid. She is also tough, kind and funny.  Needy is also driven past bewilderment to the brink of madness by what happens to Jennifer, who lures one young man after another to his doom. The jock, the goth and others are so bedazzled by her attention that they are blind to her murderous intentions. She has been similarly fooled and abused, but “Jennifer’s Body” is not only a fantasy of revenge against the predatory male sex, though the ultimate enactment of that revenge is awfully satisfying. The antagonism and attraction between boys and girls is a relatively straightforward (if, in this case, grisly) matter; the real terror, the stuff of Needy’s nightmares, lies in the snares and shadows of female friendship.  The relationship between Needy and Jennifer is rivalrous, sisterly, undermining, sadomasochistic, treacherous and tender. “Hell,” Needy asserts early on, “is a teenage girl.” If Jean-Paul Sartre were in the databank of allusions Ms. Cody has supplied her with, she might have specified that hell is other teenage girls. The inferno consumes everything around it, very nearly including the movie itself.  The palette is dark and sanguinary. The dialogue is an unstable mélange of screeches and howls and the compulsively savvy, provincial-hipster babble that is for Ms. Cody what terse Chicago indirection is for David Mamet and long-winded analysis of cultural trivia is for Quentin Tarantino.  “Cheese and fries!” Needy exclaims, though at other times she is happy to utter all manner of blasphemy. “Move on dot org,” Jennifer says, perhaps attempting to top an already legendary nonsensical non sequitur from Ms. Cody’s “Juno” screenplay: “Honest to blog.”  Honestly, though, “Juno,” mannered and self-conscious as it was, gave us, in the person of Ellen Page, a young heroine with a sharp tongue, a good heart and questionable judgment — a character who was smart, surprising and, in the end, hard to resist. Ms. Kusama’s first film, “Girlfight,” did something similar with its bruising, bruised protagonist, played by Michelle Rodriguez. And Needy, our Virgil in Ms. Cody and Ms. Kusama’s tour of teenage hell, so nimbly personified by Ms. Seyfried, belongs in this company. She’s the main reason to see “Jennifer’s Body.”  “Jennifer’s Body” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sex, swearing and buckets of blood.

While not exactly lifeless, "Jennifer's Body" sure could be fresher. Even with Megan Fox ideally cast as a sharp-fanged succubus with a lusty appetite for young male (and sometimes female) flesh, this high school horror romp tackles its bad-girl-gone-really-bad premise with eye-rolling obviousness and, fatally, a near-total absence of real scares. Fox Atomic item will stir interest as a post-"Juno" outing for scribe Diablo Cody, whose whippersnapper sensibility can be heard in the occasional snatches of self-consciously clever dialogue. But even auds primed to see guts and other exposed body parts will be disappointed by a "Body" less bawdy than advertised.
At the very least, Fox (the actress, not the studio), best known for her pinup-worthy turns in the "Transformers" movies, must be grateful for a project that requires her to do more than interact suggestively with the hood of a Camaro. Not that the role of a snotty teenage vamp reps a huge stretch: Jennifer (Fox) teases and seduces every guy within flirting distance, her sexual over-confidence masking a desperate desire to escape her tiny hometown, the unpromisingly named Devil's Kettle.
Nervously overseeing Jennifer's behavior is her nicer, smarter best friend, Needy (Amanda Seyfried, wearing glasses so as to look plain by comparison). "Sandbox love never dies," Needy muses early on, adding some latent Sapphic undertones to the pic's unholy hormonal stew, even though she has a cute, attentive b.f. (Johnny Simmons). But after the girls narrowly escape a freak fire that destroys a local tavern one night, Needy can only watch helplessly as Jennifer, possibly high on smoke fumes, gets into a van with a band of wannabe rockers whose intentions seem rather less than pure.
Hours later, Jennifer turns up at Needy's house, dripping blood, vomiting black tar and behaving in a generally unpleasant manner. But before you can say "Drag Me to Hell," she's back at school the next day, looking as healthy and voluptuous as ever -- though she has a weirdly callous attitude toward the town's rapidly mounting death toll, as one male classmate after another is found brutally dismembered.
Even this summary suggests more of a mystery than the pic actually has stashed beneath its creaky floorboards. In her latest femme-driven actioner (albeit one quite different from either her promising indie "Girlfight" or her sci-fi campfest "Aeon Flux"), helmer Karyn Kusama shows little interest in mounting suspense, instead resorting to a tired arsenal of shock cuts, jolting sound design and levitation effects. Auds have probably endured Ouija board sessions scarier than the flashback revealing the precise nature of Jennifer's demonic condition.
In "Juno," Cody succeeded in bringing her cheeky high spirits to bear on the usually sober topic of teen pregnancy; surprising, then, that she's unable to work the same magic with a much more outlandish story. Cody also exec produced "Jennifer's Body," and it certainly bears her arch comic signature, from its satirical jabs at indie-rock poseurs (who, per the script, are basically Satan's henchmen) to the way her characters tend to sound more like hyperarticulate pop-culture savants than recognizable adolescents. Fox gets plenty of juicy, double-entendre-laden dialogue with which to flaunt her carnal knowledge, though, sorry to disappoint, the R rating is more due to the pic's gore quotient than its coy almost-nudity.
Seyfried's appealing, grounded presence here may bring to mind her ditzy turn in "Mean Girls," and indeed, the current film's not-very-well-buried subtext is that it's a mean-girl tale taken to supernatural yet entirely logical extremes; the bitch trying to steal your boyfriend might just as well be evil enough to steal your soul. Fox sinks her teeth into the role with admirably bloodthirsty abandon, yet as "Jennifer's Body" approaches its overwrought climax, it's hard not to think that, as a match for her talents, the Camaro may have been the superior vehicle.
"Juno" alums include producers Mason Novick and Daniel Dubiecki; director Jason Reitman, who gets a producing credit here; and thesps Valerie Tian and J.K. Simmons, sporting an Irish accent and making the most of his brief scenes as a one-handed schoolteacher.

A premeditated cult classic—they're kind of like "pre-worn" designer jeans—Jennifer's Body  seems designed more to be quoted than watched. This is the sophomore production from Juno  screenwriter Diablo Cody , similarly told through ultra-stylized slangy teen dialogue, which is cool, in theory, in the way it respects the verbal resourcefulness of idle flyover kids, but is excruciating to listen to in actual fact. Megan Fox 's lithe Jennifer is BFF to goldfish-faced, bespectacled Amanda Seyfried 's "Needy"—the nickname underlines the essentially condescending dynamic in their high school relationship, which also digresses into the best close-up girl-girl liplock since Cruel Intentions . Jenny is transformed from a flaunting tease into a literal man-eater, a boy-gobbling succubus, after going off one night in some out-of-town rocker's van (the movie can read as a cautionary tale on the dangers of trolling for hot band dudes instead of sticking with your schlubby boyfriend), setting up a Good Girl vs. Bad Girl knock-down-drag-out. The suburban interior décor is about a generation off, but the satire is roughly contemporary, with routine "risky" digs at 9/11 kitsch (and, generally, the American "Tragedy boner") and a re-enactment of the Great White club fire. Lines like, "Sandbox love never dies," could be lyrics to the Warped Tour  riffs to which Fox slo-mo sashays at the camera.
