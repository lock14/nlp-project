``Man of the Year" has to be one of the most frustrating dropped balls in recent multiplex memory. Jon Stewart -- or someone very much like him -- runs for president and gets elected? What a great idea for a modern comedy, one that pokes right at the sore spot where politics and pop culture intersect today.
Barry Levinson is writing and directing? All the better, since 1997's ``Wag the Dog" may be the sharpest Washington satire of the past 10 years. Robin Williams is playing the comedian elevated to the Oval Office? Great; the trailer for ``Man of the Year" makes it look as though Williams is back in manic form.
Sadly, the trailer cherry-picks from the first 20 minutes, before the movie goes south in a hurry. After establishing this most topical of premises, Levinson inexplicably turns ``Man" into a dank corporate thriller with a romantic subplot that beggars belief. You can hear the smarts whoosh out of the film like air from a slashed tire.
Williams plays Tom Dobbs, host of a wildly popular late-night political comedy show. He's Stewart, Bill Maher, Al Franken, and Dennis Miller rolled into one cuddly, acerbic package, and when someone in the audience one night shouts that he should run for president, the Draft Dobbs movement takes on a momentum of its own. E-mails pour in, signatures are amassed, and the comedian starts taking the idea seriously.
Too seriously; Dobbs's stump speeches are numbers-rich planks of drywall that have his producer (Christopher Walken, as endearingly loopy as ever) and head writer (splenetic comedian Lewis Black) pitching fits. Despairs the manager, ``It's like the comedian who gets to play Carnegie Hall and shows up with a violin."
Dobbs gets the message in time to crash a televised debate like Christy Mihos on laughing gas; he wins by a landslide and shows up in Congress wearing a Founding Fathers wig, cracking wise and winning over the media. However, a glitch in the new computerized balloting system is actually responsible for his victory and Delacroy Software worker Eleanor Green (Laura Linney) wants to go public with the truth.
Her bosses, led by slimy corporate attorney Jeff Goldblum, insist the whistle-blower is a crazed former employee and break out the dirty tricks. Despite this, she manages to get close to the president-elect -- the Secret Service is apparently out getting hot dogs -- and despite all evidence she's a flake of the first order, Dobbs falls in love.
Wait a minute: What happened to that sharp political comedy? Why has Williams reverted to hangdog mode, and why is Linney, one of our best working actresses, stammering like a Trekkie at her first convention? ``Man of the Year" becomes a small, sort-of love story surrounded by a lugubrious conspiracy drama, which in turn is surrounded by the dispersing gas es of a parable that could have hurt us where we live.
The film has a great, ornery question in its sights -- if we demand our politicians entertain us, do we deserve what we get? -- but Levinson never pulls the trigger. In truth, he forgets the gun is loaded. One walks out of ``Man of the Year" aching for the squandered opportunities.


In Man of the Year , a late-night TV talk-show comic named Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams) runs for President of the United States and wins. This comes as a shock to Dobbs, his manager (Christopher Walken), and his head writer (Lewis Black), since the campaign was conceived as something between a publicity stunt and a theatrical protest against actual politicians who are too beholden to special-interest groups. It's also a shock to Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), a software specialist at a giant computer company who figures out that Dobbs' win is a result of her company's own computer error, not the fair and balanced counting of votes.
Voting fraud and contested presidential elections? Been there, done that. Entertainers elected to government office? Ditto. It's the comedian-as-truth-teller angle that's fresh in this semi-satire from writer-director Barry Levinson (Wag the Dog )  the notion that Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, or Jay Leno might do just as well as any real-life clown currently in office. (The half of the film that's not satiric is  one-quarter clunky thriller about greedy corporate types out to prevent Eleanor from going public with the truth and one-quarter requisite attraction between bachelor candidate and fetchingly neurotic whistle-blower.)
Big spin-control problem: Robin Williams would never stand a chance, either as a presidential candidate or as a TV talk-show comic, a major drawback in a what-if scenario so self-congratulatory and smug. There's not a moment in Man of the Year  when Williams isn't straining or hectoring, not one thinly amusing, standard-issue liberal riff he throws out that earns the overenthusiastic laughter the stuff produces in everyone around him, dragged out in indulgent reaction shots. (Walken and  The Daily Show 's professionally cranky Black look particularly pained when  called upon to chortle.) Williams turns out to be exactly the wrong candidate for the job, a comedian singularly uninterested in letting anyone else get a word in, but with nothing to say.
Unfortunately chosen promotional clips and pics feature Williams done up  in Thomas Jefferson drag. In context, the wig means nothing  just another  gag that earns no votes.

 In a pre-election season full of drama, contention and surprise, “Man of the Year” arrives on the scene with the blistering impact of a spoonful of cold mashed potatoes. A sort-of-political kind-of-satire written and directed by Barry Levinson, the picture resurrects a fantasy that periodically seizes the imaginations of Hollywood studios, and also, a bit less frequently, of some American voters: that a plain-talking outsider will roll into Washington, propelled by popular frustration with the status quo, and clean up the mess.  Never mind that the wish this pseudopopulist dream fulfills is less for the restoration of democracy than for its abrogation. The status quo is usually safe from whatever arrows the movies aim in its direction, and it is hard to think of a movie less likely to incite discomfort than “Man of the Year.”  This is a shame since Mr. Levinson was responsible for “Wag the Dog,” a gratifyingly sharp and imaginative dissection of the media spectacle that often confuses itself with political reality. But that movie was made at a time — the late 1990’s — when its cynical paranoia could feel fresh and pointed rather than one more voice in a weary chorus.  “Man of the Year” wants to plant itself in the noise and fury of the present, but without raising any hackles. Its hero, Tom Dobbs (Robin Williams), is a comedian who is the host of a popular television talk show. His name is frequently mentioned in the same breath as real-life models like Bill Maher and Jon Stewart. Tom’s shtick, however, is the familiar rapid-fire Robin Williams free association, more silly than stinging and more likely to titillate with sexual naughtiness than to provoke with topical insight.  Like Chris Rock’s character in the similar (and similarly disappointing) “Head of State,” Tom is meant to be honest and fearless, offering a welcome antidote to the usual timid, hypocritical candidate-speak. He serves up some pretty shocking stuff, boldly coming out in favor of environmental protection and improved education, while pointing out that politics is dominated by “special interests,” that Americans are sick of bitter partisanship, and that you can’t tell the two major parties apart anyway.  It would be impolitic of me to point out that, actually, you can. But Hollywood may be the last place in America where the dream of a nonideological consensus survives, if only in the form of commercial anxiety about alienating potential ticket buyers. And it is true that neither Republicans nor Democrats will find much to take offense at in “Man of the Year,” though for precisely that reason neither group will find much to respond to either. Unlike the television satirists whose cachet he tries to bogart, Tom is careful never to address the actual issues that provide the content and context of contemporary political argument.  Instead the movie is all about process: about the machinery of celebrity and also about voting machines. As Tom makes his improbable, impetuous way down the presidential campaign trail (facing a bland Democratic incumbent and an equally generic Republican challenger), a second plot unfolds at a company called Delacroy, which has a lucrative franchise in computerized voting systems.  Eleanor Green (Laura Linney), a Delacroy employee, attempts to alert her bosses to a glitch in the software, and for her pains is stalked, defamed, harassed and lectured by Jeff Goldblum, who plays the company’s slimy chief lawyer. (Not that the flaw is the result of anything as provocative as a political conspiracy. Just technical difficulties.)  The two plots converge in a multigenre pileup that wrecks whatever comic momentum the movie might have had. It swerves from thriller to romantic comedy to farce without much conviction, though you can occasionally salvage a glimmer of amusing possibility. Mr. Williams scores with a few throwaway jokes. Lewis Black (as a writer on Tom’s show) rants and gesticulates and provides a link with the real world of abrasive television humor.  Christopher Walken, as Tom’s wise and loyal manager, has a good time, as he always does, pausing in midsentence, raising his eyebrows and defying gravity with his hair. Ms. Linney, bless her, insists on acting, which she is very good at but which is pretty much irrelevant here.  After many speeches, “Man of the Year” arrives at the shocking conclusion that maybe the White House is not the best outlet for a professional comedian. I’m glad that argument, at least for now, is settled.    “Man of the Year” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It’s a whole lot cleaner than anything you hear from the real world of politics these days.

Like today's fractious, fragmented state of the union, Barry Levinson's "Man of the Year" is a curious hybrid -- a political/action/comedy/thriller in which Robin Williams becomes president of the United States. A movie as uneven as it sounds, "Man" is less laugh-out-loud funny than topical and suspenseful, but pic could be achieve a modest B.O. vote.
Computer wonk Eleanor Green (Laura Linney in tour de force perf) knows her company's new electronic voting machine has a glitch, one that might skew the outcome of the upcoming presidential election. Her boss, Hemmings (Rick Roberts), poohs-poohs her doubts, but secretly panics; his evil lieutenant Stewart (Jeff Goldblum) plots to have Eleanor attacked and injected with a cocktail of recreational drugs, so she will lose all her credibility and won't be able to harm the company, Delacroy Voting Systems.
Delacroy couldn't care less who wins the presidential election, however, as long as its stock price stays secure. So, when Tom Dobbs (Williams), a Jon Stewart-inspired talkshow host and political gadfly, wins a three-way race for the White House, the company is very happy to let him sit in the president's chair.
"A perception of legitimacy is more important than legitimacy itself," Stewart tells the troubled Eleanor.
What becomes the moral dilemma of the movie, though, is whether the country is better off letting Tom keep the job of president -- he's obviously the most decent and well-intentioned candidate -- or not.
"Man of the Year" is a fruity member on the family tree of "Meet John Doe," "Dave" and any number of other populist political fantasies, but Levinson also critiques current events, the media and the political system itself. Sometimes this is done pointedly, sometimes offhandedly: The appearance of Chris Matthews, Catherine Cryer and James Carville, playing TV pundits, makes one wonder if news people are at all concerned about their own credibility.
Christopher Walken is terrific as Tom's manager, Jack Menken, and Lewis Black, who ratchets down his usually manic delivery on "The Daily Show," is utterly convincing and very funny as Dobbsian operative Eddie Langston.
Unfortunatley, Williams is not particularly funny, and, as if to compensate, Levinson and editors Steven Weisberg and Blair Daily cut to reaction shots each time Tom cracks a joke.
Williams comes off too stiff for a performer who has achieved such widespread popularity. His lines aren't particularly fresh or crisply delivered and his manner is, well, mannered. Although much is made of his bachelorhood during the early campaign part of the pic so that one assumes he must be gay, later he falls for Eleanor -- which is the smartest thing he does in the movie.
The best scenes are between Linney and Williams; she raises his game, and his often mawkish sincerity suddenly becomes perfectly natural.
While there are many implausibilities in "Man of the Year," pic eventually overcomes an awkward start and turns into a satisfying candidate for the disposable movie dollar with a story that stays on your mind.

Writer-director Barry Levinson 's return to the political realm after 1997's Wag the Dog  is no heroic comebackfar from it, even if it's better than the trailer makes it appear. Buried beneath its pale satiric surface is a not-bad ideawhat would happen if an outsider candidate, a TV comedian played by Robin Williams , became a White House  insiderbut Levinson's too distracted to make any kind of point. He loses his movie, his audience, and his purpose in a tangle of conspiracy theories and crackpot notions that sink the movie just when it begins to transcend expectations. In short, it would have been great if it had stopped, oh, 12 minutes in. No such luck, though do feel free to walk out when Laura Linney  shows. Nothing against Linney, but her appearance here, as a worker at a voting-machine manufacturing company ruled by despots more concerned with profit than precision, throws the movie out of whack. What could have been something prescient and relevantnever more so than at a time when Texas contends with electing Texas Jewboy Kinky Friedman  as its governorventures deep into nutjob territory even Oliver Stone 's abandoned for higher ground.
