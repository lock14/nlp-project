Elsewhere on this page, you�ll find me lamenting the death of the Hollywood horror film. Well, nuts to that. I stand corrected and ready to eat my creepers, thanks to Final Destination 3
, a horror film (or, more accurately, a shocker
 film) that takes such exuberant, gleeful delight in the unspeakably gory dispatch of assorted teenagers that it may well be the most fun you�ll have at the movies all week. It�s not going to nab any golden statuettes, mind you, nor will the Merchant Ivory crowd be clamoring to view it � although I admit it�d be fun to watch their reactions � but, in its own morbid little way, this is very much a stand-up-and-cheer � or shriek, as the case may be � kind of film. Of course, you�re cheering for Death Itself, posited in this oddly winning franchise as an unstoppable, elemental force and also an obsessive/compulsive stickler for unobvious minutiae, or, as I like to call it, Rube Goldberg. When a septet of high school grads skips out on what proves to be the world�s deadliest roller-coaster ride, they learn the hard, fast, and painful way that it may not be nice to fool mother nature, sure, but mess around with the grim reaper and you�re up the Styx with neither paddle nor Charon fare. One by one, they are sliced, skewered, mushed, and mashed off of this mortal coil in some of the cleverest and, if the audience I saw the film with is any indication, most crowd-pleasing convolutions imaginable. I can only surmise how much fun it was for screenwriters Glenn Morgan and James Wong to try to outdo each other in the Improbable Death department, but since the finished product involves nail guns, subway trains, fireworks, and tanning beds, you can rest assured these are two writers who likely had no trouble getting out of bed in the morning. Nice work, if you can get it, but then the same could be said for Death. All this prompts the nagging question: Is it wrong to enjoy something that appears to serve no other purpose than to enumerate the myriad types of trauma that can be inflicted on the human form? To judge from our current Mideast imbroglio and the generally high splatter quotient outside the gates of the dream factory, the answer is apparently �no.� Just don�t show the real deal on television. And for God�s sake, pay your taxes.


Every weekend, horror films lure in millions of kids and usually send them home bummed: That's it? As the end credits rolled after a public showing of last week's moneymaker, "When a Stranger Calls," the audience made catcalls. But the filmmakers and the studios don't seem to care -- a big opening weekend at the box office is preordained.
The horror film has been getting away with murder. Crazy but true: "Final Destination 3" has come to the rescue.
Week in and week out, horror movies cheat us, so it's wonderfully cathartic to watch a bunch of kids cheat death in what turns out to be the best installment yet in the "Final Destination" franchise.
If you missed the previous two chapters, the series is about fate's inexorable will. Or something like that. A teen has a premonition that he or she will perish on a plane (the first movie) or on the interstate (the nasty sequel) with his or her peers. The teen warns of doom, no one listens, and nearly everyone dies. Those who escape harm are chased and killed, until the embattled clairvoyant manages to show death the door.
In "Final Destination 3," an amusement park roller coaster is the disaster site of choice. Sitting in a car of Devil's Flight, Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) has a vision that it will send its riders hurtling off the tracks. And what a vision it is: A dozen people harness themselves in and after one passenger's video camera falls onto the rails (in a sly diss to digital filmmaking), kids are hanging on for dear life and being dumped out when the ride stops at the crest of a loop. It's every thrill junkie's nightmare, and not long after Wendy opens her eyes and demands to be let out, it comes true.
She loses her boyfriend and her best friend but does have her best friend's boyfriend, Kevin (Ryan Merriman), to turn to. As death makes house calls, they study the photos Wendy took before the disaster, desperate for clues about how the survivors will die.
They track down potential victims and are treated like Cassandras, which allows the movie's wicked streak to show. After two dingbats fry in their twin tanning beds, the film lovingly cuts to a pair of matching coffins. (Before they sizzle, they bop to Ohio Players' "Love Rollercoaster.") A lot of the murders are caused by hilarious, elaborately rigged "accidents." Waiting for the grisly punch line is like watching a spark race down a long, winding fuse in an especially sick Wile E. Coyote cartoon. The mishaps could be like Olympic events for which you should feel free to hold up a judge's score card.
James Wong, the maker of the first edition, directed and co-wrote this third installment with an abundance of humor. Even better, this is the rare recent horror movie that seems to care about suspense (will Wendy's sister bite the dust?) and is still able to chuckle at itself without exploding into heartlessness, the way "Final Destination 2" did. The deaths here are warnings. Beware amusement park rides, tanning beds, fast food drive-throughs, nail guns, and the crossed sabers that hang above your gym equipment.
Wendy and Kevin grow surprisingly sympathetic, but the victims are laughable high-school stereotypes (the jock, the goth, the skirt-chasing creep who graduated years ago but won't go away). For the most part, their demises are a consequence of how vapid they are. Death don't like stupid. It does not mind, however, entertaining the stuffing out of us.

I'm used to teenagers getting pumped at horror films, treating them as trash comedies of fear. Yet as I listened to a mostly young preview audience react to the gruesomely elaborate deaths in Final Destination 3 , the cheers, laughs, and awestruck ''Whoaaas!'' growing more delirious with each slaughter, I thought, Why stop there? Bring on the gladiators!
The Final Destination  films, in case you missed the first two, are the modern mall equivalent of those guilty-pleasure Omen  sequels. It's not so much that the devil is involved (though, in a vague sort of way, he is). No, it's all about the deaths. Final Destination 3  opens with a huge roller-coaster crash (a follow-up to the plane crash and traffic accident that kicked off the first two films), and then, one by one, a handful of high school seniors who were ejected from the ride at the last minute get what's coming to them anyway. It's an escalating contest of can-you-top-this brutality, with each death staged as the final link in a Rube Goldberg chain reaction. As a dude sits in his car at a fast-food drive-in station, a truck spins off the road at the last minute, and when it smashes into the back of the car  bzzzz!  the guy's head gets meloned by a whirring fan blade.
What makes all of this ''fun,'' instead of dark or threatening, is that the victim was an idiot who leered at the class teases with horny glee. Take that, perv! But, of course, the babes get it too; they're each trapped in a tanning chamber, the camera lingering on their singed naked flesh. In Final Destination 3 , all the victims are spoiled pills who razz one another with toxic distaste. When they get offed, they're being punished not for their sexuality (as in a slasher film) but simply for the crime of being the annoying scuzz they are  and the audience, grooving on the bad vibes, goes wild.
Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), who's the closest thing the movie has to a virginal nice-girl heroine, has taken pictures of each one of the victims that foreshadow their grisly ends; the murders, in other words, arrive by cosmic design. But where is the grand mysterious force of evil coming from? At a horror roller coaster as breezy in its blood thrills as Final Destination 3 , it almost seems to be coming from the audience.


As yet another gaggle of clueless teens runs around trying to postpone their appointments with Death, the question inevitably arises: Will there ever be a final "Final Destination"? Not as long as this durably gimmicky series, admittedly one of the wittier horror franchises in recent years, continues to dispense sadistic Rube Goldberg death traps with all the dramatic import of a kid frying ants under a magnifying glass. First two installments grossed more than $50 million and $40 million, respectively, and New Line should anticipate marginally lower returns from this slapdash sequel before it reaches a more lucrative destination on homevideo. 
In the original "Final Destination" (whose director, James Wong, is back for this third round), a group of high schoolers narrowly avoided a fatal plane crash, only to find that Death doesn't stay cheated for long. Here, the pre-empted tragedy is a freak roller-coaster accident, which Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) somehow foresees and manages to escape, though not in time to save sweetheart Jason (Jesse Moss) and pal Carrie (Gina Holden).
Now Wendy has to put aside her differences with Carrie's boyfriend Kevin (Ryan Merriman, last seen in the prologue to "The Ring Two") as they try to stop the chain of fatalities that inevitably will befall them and the other survivors -- an incredulous group that includes a jock (Texas Battle), a sneering goth couple (Kris Lemche and Alexz Johnson) and Wendy's bratty younger sister, Julie (Amanda Crew).
First to go are the requisite dumb hotties, Ashlyn (Crystal Lowe) and Ashley (Chelan Simmons), who walk into a tanning salon and don't come out alive. Elaborately worked out scene is milked for mean-spirited comedy rather than suspense, and culminates in a sight gag so savagely inspired, it leaves one chortling at least a minute into the obligatory funeral sequence.
Subsequent killings are even more horrifically baroque, as once again, Death proves to be a highly resourceful if somewhat geekily detail-obsessed manipulator of inanimate objects. Helmer Wong (who also scripted and produced with Glen Morgan) doesn't generate tension so much as initiate a queasy guessing game about the source of the next grisly "accident" -- a weight machine? a runaway truck? condensation from a soft drink? -- punctuated by an occasional frisson of pitch-black humor.
But whereas "Final Destination 2" at least strove for narrative intricacy, imagining a clever time-death continuum with the characters and events from the original, new pic is a desultorily plotted affair that feels less like a thriller than a homicidal checklist. In their race to save their classmates, Wendy and Kevin essentially end up triggering one bloodbath after another; it never occurs to them that they might do a lot more good by minding their own business.
In the story's one major stroke of invention, the usual premonitions of death have been replaced with a set of photos (snapped by Wendy on the night of the roller-coaster accident) strewn with clues foreshadowing each character's demise. Apparently, the Grim Reaper isn't just a petty avenger but an irrepressible showoff, as even 9/11 is revealed -- in a truly tasteless real-world reference -- to be part of Death's grand design.
In a role that occasions much screaming and weeping offset by the occasional doom-laden epiphany, Winstead is often too sniveling and mopey by half, but still provides a solid anchor. Pic's "gotcha!" ending is just as half-hearted as the kicker that concluded its predecessor, but far more belabored.

Form mimics narrative in this rote sequel that surely no one was waiting for: Like the serially thwarted Death (the only "character" to return from the first two Final Destination  movies), audiences are required to endure banal exposition and junior-high-level foreshadowing before being treated to the nauseatingly detailed scenes of CGI slaughter that are the series' bread and butter. No wonder the grim reaper is so pissed off in these things. Like its predecessors, this latest examination of the perils of Thanatos interruptus features a gaggle of uni-dimensional teensled here by Wendy (Mary Elizabeth Winstead )who cheat death and pay the price via a variety of inventive means. The notion of butchery as a spectator event notwithstanding, there's an almost admirably workmanlike quality to the way co- scenarists Glen Morgan  and James Wong  set up their characters for carnage like so many fleshy bowling pins; that viewers will forget the various squashings, decapitations, nail gunnings, and gorings before the credits even roll is beside the point. Hell, these guys could have a future in network news, if not politics.
