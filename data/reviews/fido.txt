         A crafty mixture of George Romero and Douglas Sirk, "Fido" is a boy and his zombie movie that may have an unusually pastoral color scheme but tears into its many satirical targets — war, class, nuclear families, the '50s, our culture of death and violence — with the vigor of a freshly reborn flesh-eater.
 
 Director and co-writer Andrew Currie shows that style and wit in a zombie movie need not solely be relegated to a top-notch gore effects department. It's a manicured, martini-ed small-town suburbia named Willard where "Fido" is set, the only evidence of a nasty war with the undead being the taming of the enemy into a docile (if clumsily slow) working class. Zombies are now milkmen, gardeners and domestic help, and the bio-technology that allows this — a collar whose red light indicates OK-to-engage — comes from the ubiquitous corporation Zomcon, whose soothing newsreels promise a future free of biting and, going unspoken naturally, safe for humans to live with their comforting diet of repression.
 


         






   Such is the lot of 11-year-old Timmy Robinson (K'Sun Ray), bullied at school and ignored by his golf-obsessed dad (Dylan Baker). When his exquisitely presentable homemaker mother (aquiline beauty Carrie-Anne Moss) finally keeps up with the Joneses and gets her own zombie servant (Billy Connolly), Timmy sees in their new dull-eyed, grey-skinned possession a companion to love and protect. And in a delicious twist on the Golden Rule, it seems that in moments of crisis, even with that instinct-tamping collar off, a well-treated zombie remembers who its friends are. (One of them isn't, however, cranky old Mrs. Henderson.)
 
 The expected "Lassie" gag comes an hour in, but it's worth the wait, especially when Currie and co-writers Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton have already been providing pointed laughs. Most consistently funny is a deadpan Henry Czerny as the pipe-smoking, battle-hardened Zomcon head of security, who blithely asks a roomful of schoolchildren how many of them have killed a zombie and asserts to the Robinsons over cocktails how quickly he'd take his wife's head off if he had to. ("He's always saying that," she says with a giggle.)
 
 Scottish comedian-actor Connolly has the real trench work though, giving what must be cinema's first fully realized zombie portrayal. Yes, he nails the growls with expected rabidity and reacts to a playful spray from a garden hose with hilariously stifled joy, but when reacting to the perfumed scent of Moss' lonely housewife, Connolly subtly suggests all that the undead have lost. It's a surprising moment in a mostly jokey film, but it indicates as much as the cultural satire and gleamingly effective period décor that, ironically enough, there's still a lot of life left in the zombie flick.

 Much like zombies, zombie movies show no sign of rolling over and staying dead, really, truly, most sincerely dead. In recent years, they have run speedily amok in Danny Boyle’s spine-tingler “28 Days Later” and its sequel, “28 Weeks Later” (where the virus-stricken creatures are more zomboid than true zombies), as well as in the remake of George A. Romero’s “Dawn of the Dead.” Ever the classicist, Mr. Romero keeps his zombies moving slow but steady in his rollicking “Land of the Dead,” the 2005 chapter in the zombie epic that shuddered into existence with his 1968 masterwork, “Night of the Living Dead.”  In the ticklishly amusing satire “Fido,” the undead stagger along like stunned toddlers. With their shuffling, uncertain gait, their limbs slowed by the onslaught of rigor mortis, these zombies are thoroughly, satisfyingly old school. Lost in a twilight zone between life and death, gripped by a hunger that can only be satisfied with a mouthful of warm human flesh, they live, in a manner of speaking, to eat. The good news for their would-be snacks and treats, meaning everyone who’s nominally alive, is that these zombies are also in the grip of remote-controlled obedience collars that keep them as harmless as a neutered Rottweiler on a very short leash. One zap and they’re mewling like kittens or at least growling more quietly.  Directed by Andrew Currie, who wrote the guffaw-splattered, lightly bloody, bit too modest screenplay with Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton, the film takes place in the 1950s, or some freaky-fantasy variation on the same, in a small town washed in muted colors and occasionally rocked by a blast of angry red. In this perky Pleasantville, where father knows best except when he loses his head, zombies don’t feast on the living; they serve them. They mow the lawns, guard the crosswalks and deliver the daily paper. Every so often, they also dispense a little something extra, like the teenage zombie, Tammy (Sonja Bennett), whose tight curves and scarily chattering teeth keep her owner, Mr. Theopolis (Tim Blake Nelson, a hoot), dementedly smiling.  Like his slower-moving characters, Mr. Currie exhibits distinct cannibalistic tendencies, starting with the clever black-and-white educational reel that opens “Fido” and lays out the back story (“the zombie wars” and what followed). Watching morosely from the last row in class is little Timmy (K’Sun Ray), the only, crushingly lonely child of Helen and Bill Robinson (Carrie-Anne Moss and Dylan Baker). With his wide-pooling eyes, Timmy looks straight out of central casting, if also seriously ill at ease when squeezing off rounds during zombie-target practice. He’s not much of a shot, one of the few in the class who doesn’t raise a hand when a visiting containment expert, Mr. Bottoms (Henry Czerny, excellent), asks: “How many of you have ever had to kill a zombie?”  Timmy would rather play catch, which he does soon after Helen decides to elevate her social standing by bringing a collared and apparently tamed zombie home. (Everyone else in the neighborhood has one, she whines.) Named Fido — and played by a wonderfully expressive, nearly mute Billy Connolly — the Robinson zombie soon becomes a mostly cherished member of the family, with Bill the sole dissenter. As Bill nervously twitches and Helen basks in the glow of consumer satisfaction, Timmy and Fido bond, first over a baseball and mitt, then over a little accidental bloodletting and later during one wittily shot scene in a sweeping field that summons up every boy-and-dog story that brought a tear to the eye.  Mr. Currie and his collaborators don’t push their slave-master allegory far; unlike Mr. Romero or the zombie comedy “Shaun of the Dead,” where the living are so zombie-like they don’t initially notice the undead, the filmmakers remain content to graze and to nibble, skimming the surface rather than sinking in deep. They set up a divide between the light-skinned humans and the dark-skinned zombies that they never fully engage, shying away from anything heavy or dangerously downbeat. Mr. Currie and company are happy to make you laugh, which they do easily enough, especially with a beautifully slow-to-build joke that demands a familiarity with the typical story arc and climactic dialogue from the old “Lassie” television series. It won’t make you bleed, just howl.  “Fido” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). In spite of some gnawed-off limbs and bloodied necks, the gore quotient is surprisingly modest.

Already a familiar-enough conceit to have earned its own subgenre nickname (zom-com), the zombie comedy gets a frisky yet strangely familiar workout in "Fido." Set in a retro future where the radiation-produced cannibal undead have forced the normal folks into heavily fortified Eisenhower-era bomb shelters, this Canadian-produced tale of a boy and his dog -- well, his collared, leashed, "tamed" zombie best friend -- is brightly packaged and steadily amusing, even if the script never really develops anything interesting from its high-concept premise. Lionsgate pickup in the U.S. will probably post modest returns as a would-be cult pic that's not quite as edgy as it thinks it is.
Sending up 1950s social archetypes to nail conformity, conservativism and the ever-dysfunctional family is well-trod terrain, whether used for whimsy ("Pleasantville") or black-comedy horror (Bob Balaban's far more raw  "Parents"). If  "Fido" ultimately lacks the oomph to push the idea in any really fresh directions, it nonetheless does provide colorful diversion milking the basic contrast between wholesome setting and incongruously dark elements.
Ashy-blue-skinned zombies haul trash, mow lawns and do any other grunt work that needs to be done in picture-perfect Willard, as they've done since the Zombie Wars of a generation prior, the history of which is told via a B&W classroom instructional film (taken from helmer Andrew Currie's own 1996 short "Night of the Living").
Communities now live under the protection of a corporation called ZomCon, which maintains the electrified fences keeping the wild zombies out. Domesticated zombies have replaced the low-income illegal immigrant laborers of yore, and they wear a collar that keeps them from eating their masters.
Juvenile protag Timmy Robinson (the unfortunately named K'Sun Ray) is the friendless odd boy out in his ultra-conformist classroom and neighborhood, picked on by bullies, ignored by his dad (Dylan Baker as Bill) and gently chided by a mom (Carrie-Anne Moss as Helen) who's channeled her marital frustrations into keeping-up-with-the-Joneses.
Unable to live any longer with the shame of having no zombie servants, Helen acquires one (Billy Connolly). While he gets off to a clumsy start as a housekeeper, the zombie soon proves a boy's best friend -- he's aces as a loyal pal capable of playing fetch and snarling at enemies -- and thus is named Fido by Timmy.
Unfortunately, Fido's collar goes on the fritz briefly, resulting in the demise -- and subsequent revival -- of the lane's least beloved old biddy. Timmy is able to cover this up, albeit only after a mini-plague of flesh eating erupts. Meanwhile, Mr. Robinson grows increasingly uncomfortable with having Fido around the house, especially since the creature -- who even when his collar fails bloodlusts only for those he doesn't like -- seems to be showing up Mr. Robinson's failings as husband and father.
Script penned by Currie, Robert Chomiak and Dennis Heaton (from Heaton's original story) has been in rewrites for some 13 years and feels perhaps too smoothed out in the long march to production (as British Columbia's biggest-budgeted indie feature, purportedly).
There are amusing situations and characters, but they never develop past first impression, let alone take flight into inspired loopiness or bad-taste hilarity a la "Shaun of the Dead."
For all the pic's surface novelty, its various macabre, satirical and family-drama aspects as directed by Currie ("Mile Zero") co-habit harmlessly rather than jostling one another to disturbing, inventive or laugh-out-loud effect. 
Perfs are decent within their limits (though Moss doesn't seem to have an instinct for the kind of low-key camp required), and design contributors have fun whipping up a widescreen milieu of apple-pie affluence along withmodest gore. Don Macdonald's original score strikes the right kitschy yet deadpan note.
A pleasant watch that evaporates quickly from the memory, "Fido" is something perhaps no movie involving cannibalism should be: cute but kinda bland.

You think they're dead, these zombie-film parodies, but, one after another, they keep lumbering back. Not much brain activity, alas, in this Canadian indie, which rather non-hilariously dispatches its walking corpses to '50s suburbia, where they're put to work as domestic servants and gardeners. For anyone who hasn't pictured the movie's 91 minutes already: In sunny Willard, docile, gray-faced zombies carry golf clubs and duly provide target practice for Red Scareera schoolkids, until a particularly ravenous ghoul takes a chunk out of old Mrs. Henderson's fleshy arm. Within 20 minutes, Vancouver -based writer-director Andrew Currie  leads us to stop expecting actual jokes while squandering the talents of an overqualified cast that includes Dylan Baker  and Carrie-Anne Moss  as the film's Ward and June Cleaver , and Scottish actor Billy Connolly  as the titular zombie-cum-pet and loyal pal of the couple's young son (K'Sun Ray ). The movie's Pleasantville  sets are well designed on a slim budget, but the '50s-style restraint extends to Currie's tame direction and generally makes a zombie-lover hungry for the real deal à la 28 Weeks Later which was still taking a bite out of the box office at last check.
