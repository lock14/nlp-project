The great film-noir actors, like Robert Mitchum and Sterling Hayden, wore a scowl of hunger that gave them a low-down, predatory glamour. They were men, not boys. But Jesse Metcalfe, who stars in Beyond a Reasonable Doubt , a remake of the 1956 noir classic, has about as much inner darkness as a puppy. Metcalfe, formerly of Desperate Housewives , is swarthy and handsome in a cloying, baby-gigolo way; the only emotion he radiates is eagerness to be liked. He’s certainly plausible as a local TV news reporter looking for a big break. But then he goes after a corrupt district attorney (Michael Douglas) who’s been piling up convictions by planting DNA evidence.
How will Metcalfe expose this scoundrel? By incriminating himself in a homicide, a feat that he accomplishes by collecting fake evidence  a jackknife, athletic shoes matching the imprint left at the scene of the crime  with the eager-beaverness of a kid on a scavenger hunt. Beyond a Reasonable Doubt  was written and directed by Peter Hyams (Outland ), who brings a touch of neo-'80s, Gee, let's throw in a car chase!  hackery to this pile of contrivances. He squeezes a bit of suspenseful juice out of the old plot, and Douglas makes smarm a chewy pleasure, but this is a noir in search of a hero we can root for because we actually buy what he’s doing.


 If we learn anything from “Beyond a Reasonable Doubt,” a remake of Fritz Lang’s 1956 drama of the same name, it’s that flawed movies are rarely improved by car chases and the addition of Michael Douglas. Not that Mr. Douglas, playing a crooked Louisiana district attorney, can really be blamed for that faraway look in his eye: if you were burdened  with a coif so pampered it virtually demands its own dialogue, you’d be embarrassed too.  Compounding the awkwardness is Jesse Metcalfe’s performance as C. J., a rabid reporter who suspects the district attorney  of fabricating evidence.  Hoping to prove this — and  perhaps  win a Pulitzer — C. J., aided by a colleague (Joel David Moore), frames himself for the murder of a prostitute. One prosecution and one-too-many plot twists later, C. J. learns that pretty-boy looks and a penchant for unwieldy outbursts (“This is the diem we have to carpe!”) are no match for a supersmart girlfriend. (Even a thoroughly bored Amber Tamblyn is better than none at all.)  Capably directed by Peter Hyams (who removed the anti-death-penalty slant from Douglas Morrow’s 1956 screenplay), “Beyond a Reasonable Doubt” barrels along without fuss or emotional depth. Despite excellent stunt work and a too-brief appearance by Orlando Jones as an unflappable cop, the movie — unlike Mr. Douglas’s hairdo — never rises above mediocrity.  “Beyond a Reasonable Doubt” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Unconvincing seduction and convincing vehicular shenanigans.
Of his empty, completely unnecessary remake of Fritz Lang 's 1956 thriller, writer-director-cinematographer-producer Peter Hyams  explains in the press notes, "I wanted to make almost a classic film noir, except I wanted it with young people; I didn't want it with grown-ups." Parsed further, "almost a classic film noir" means an especially twisty episode of CSI ; "young people" includes the shirtless gardener from Desperate Housewives   and the ectomorphic doofus who shills for cell phones and Best Buy ; and "grown-ups" equals Michael Douglas  collecting a paycheck. Set in Shreveport , Louisiana, Beyond a Reasonable Doubt  finds ambitious TV reporter C.J. Nicholas  (Jesse Metcalfe ), aided by his smart-aleck colleague (Joel David Moore ), hatching a convoluted plan in which he implicates himself in a murder to prove that a slick D.A. vying for governor (Douglas)—whose assistant (Amber Tamblyn ) is sleeping with C.J.—is manipulating evidence. Lang's film, the last he made in the U.S., exposed the immorality of the death penalty; Hyams's retread offers only more plot and longer, louder car chases. Though she's the youngest of the principals, 26-year-old Tamblyn (as anyone who saw her incredible performance in 2006's Stephanie Daley   can attest) proves she is the only one who can act like an adult.
