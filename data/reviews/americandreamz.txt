Weitz Brothers, Weitz Brothers, Weitz Brothers. Paul and Chris, you did your thing, dawgs. You made it to Hollywood (Chuck & Buck
), you made your money (American Pie
), made some art (About a Boy
), and then you got back into the indie thing (you produced Bickford Schmeckler�s Cool Ideas
. which screened at SXSW, and I totally pimped that). That�s a real interesting progression, but then you cut the brotherly cord, leaving Paul to make In Good Company
 and American Dreamz
 on his own. And tonight I just wasn�t feeling it. I think you�re both still in it to win this thing, and I wanna see what you do in the future, but American Dreamz
 is kind of all over the place from the beginning. You have a guy like Simon Cowell (Grant), and he�s really good at doing that one particular thing. You�re telling us television executives are heartless and manipulative, and that�s kind of edgy, but it�s also kind of just, like, �Hey, Hugh Grant is being like Simon.� And I think we all agree at this stage in American culture that television executives are heartless and manipulative, so you�re going to have to really nail
 it, man. We�ve heard it before. We know what to expect when the best karaoke singer in Padookie, Ohio (Moore) gets her heart set on becoming a TV pop star. That whole part of the movie was not that tight, and you took way too long in getting to the contest. But hold up, I�m not done. You started pulling it together when you stepped up the part where Dennis Quaid plays the president of the United States � the current one. He�s called Staton, but it�s G.W., and Marcia Gay Harden is tight as Laura. When you needed somebody to satirize Texans, you called in Texans, and I appreciate that. Without the ear transmitter broadcasting from his chief advisor (Dafoe in his most terrifying role ever), the president can�t keep that constipated smirk off his face. That�s what your movie is really about, dawg. It�s not about the vapidity of popular culture; it�s about the country-fried jackass at the helm of our nation. You were thisclose. But you�re driving around with Hugh Grant and Mandy Moore in a Ferrari too much. Your satire could have been a lot more balls-out. You�re telling me straight out George W. Bush is a likable chump who would be sensible enough to be horrified if he actually read a newspaper, and you�re giving me one of the cinema�s most seething villains as Karl Rove. That�s a pretty big thing to say, and you could have really brought your game. But you did the crossover thing. You�re working on youth appeal as the creators of American Pie
. We all know Idol
 sucks. Maybe America will prove me wrong by voting, but I felt like you were holding back until the end. And I think if the kids like you, that�ll be okay. You�re showing them something more than Jessica Alba�s humps. Your song choices (by Stephen Trask) were good. Your cast was good. It was pretty okay, but you�ve set the bar higher on this competition.


''American Dreamz" is a political satire that's eerily emblematic of the moment we're living in: smart, spring-loaded with pop culture references, and far too good-natured to do any lasting damage.
Real satire -- like ''Dr. Strangelove," or ''Network," or ''The Manchurian Candidate" -- leaves an audience checking itself for wounds. Paul Weitz's effervescent farce, by contrast, plays like the Cartoon Network version of Robert Altman's ''Nashville," and for all the film's shallow daring -- not to mention gleeful, generous performances from a cast clearly having the time of their lives -- it never leaves any blood on the floor. The movie's a perfectly fun Tinker Toy.
Weitz's two biggest conceits -- that an ''American Idol"-style reality show could bring out the worst in a culture and that our president could be a genial pinhead controlled by White House insiders -- ain't exactly fresh groceries. Still, ''American Dreamz" pitches its softballs with style. Martin Tweed, the preeningly heartless British host of the title TV show, just may be the great comic role that has always eluded Hugh Grant. If Simon Cowell had in fact sold his soul to the devil (the jury's still out), Martin might be the result.
Similarly, only a savvy actor like Dennis Quaid could so slyly time the pauses between misfiring neurons that characterize the thought processes of Joe Staton, the US president who suggests a faithful but not terribly bright golden retriever. Staton awakes the morning after reelection and decides to read the newspapers for a change; what he learns there amazes and confounds him. ''There's three kinds of Iraqis," he informs his chief of staff (Willem Dafoe, dancing merrily through the movie with Dick Cheney's glasses and chrome dome). ''You knew
 about this?"
The events that bring the reality-show host and the head of state together are many and engagingly messy. For the latest season of ''American Dreamz," Martin orders his minions (John Cho and Judy Greer) to ''bring me some freaks," and they readily oblige. From Padookie, Ohio, comes Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), a Britney bottle-blonde whose eyes narrow with pleasure at the thought of eviscerating the competition. From Orange County by way of Afghanistan comes Omer (Sam Golzari), a saucer-eyed apprentice terrorist more than happy to forget glorious martyrdom for a chance to sing ''The Impossible Dream" on national TV.
Making fun of Islamic terrorists is about as dangerous as Weitz gets here, and the satire might sting if the jihadists weren't such silly old bears, extras with glued-on beards. Still, a shot of Omer's sleeper-cell members sitting in his extended family's hot tub is almost worth the price of admission, as are all the performances by the actors playing the flush-with-success Rizas. In particular, Tony Yalda as Omer's queen-bitch gay cousin Iqbal and Shohreh Aghdashloo, coming on like a mischievous Arab Mrs. Robinson as Omer's aunt, pocket the movie whenever they're onscreen.
They have competition -- at times, ''American Dreamz" is as crowded as an opening episode of ''The Apprentice." In Sally's corner is her sweet, dim Iraq-vet boyfriend (Chris Klein), of whom she says, ''Every time he smiles, I want to hit him with my shoe." Marcia Gay Harden channels Laura Bush as the first lady -- fish-in-a-barrel stuff, this -- while Adam Busch plays a contestant who's a rapping cantor. In general, the reality-show segments get their laughs without being noticeably more bizarre than what's already on ''American Idol."
Similarly with the political humor, although Quaid makes the president almost touching in his desire to form a complete sentence on his own and Dafoe really should do comedy more often: it seems to clear his pores. You'll find more trenchant potshots on ''The Daily Show," though, and if that makes a depressing case for the current state of satire, I mean it to.
''American Dreamz" tries to wind it up big, with all the characters and agendas coming to a head on the climactic show. If Weitz lacks the finesse (or the right editor) to pull it off, at least he doesn't spoil the vibe he has established; the movie stays true to its cheerful tastelessness.
At the same time, you're aching for ''American Dreamz" to go a little crazy, to risk the cauterizing comic anger that blasts assumptions and frees minds. At one point, Omer innocently asks, ''Are Americans to blame for America?" That's a question with more levels than a shopping mall. Weitz lets it lay, though. He's content to tickle our ribs here, and you want to tell him: The hell with that -- make us hurt
.


         What is the American dream, exactly? Does anybody know? Must it involve instant TV celebrity and a spread in InStyle? Why is our storied national drive intrinsically linked to either sleep or fantasy? And the big question: Does the conviction that we're all entitled to live it ultimately help or harm us?
 
  "American Dreamz," Paul Weitz's good-natured satire of pop, politics and our bloated sense of entitlement (arguably our biggest export) lampoons the great American disconnect from reality by locating the place where all these things intersect. Ultimately, the movie's heart, or at least its sense of boundaries, belongs to Hollywood, so it's not surprising that it ends up being harder on its crazed celebrity dreamers than on the inept commander in chief who tries to curry popular favor by jumping on their bandwagon.
 


         






    Hugh Grant plays Martin Tweed, the slick, self-loathing host of a top-rated talent show called "American Dreamz." A barb-tongued meanie (when his girlfriend leaves him in the opening scene, he blurts, "You make me want to be a better person. And — I'm not a better person!"), Martin is the ideal purveyor of cynically engineered pop fantasies, wobbling precariously at the top of the entertainment heap. A few seasons in, his show has become an international juggernaut, prompting the chief of staff (Willem Dafoe) of the newly re-elected, low-approval-rated President Staton (Dennis Quaid) to offer the president as a guest judge on its finale.
 
  As far as Martin is concerned, the president stands to gain more from the appearance than he does. What he does need, desperately, is human interest. The show's appeal depends on a carefully calibrated mix of pathos and pathological ambition, as he tells his producers (hilariously played by John Cho and Judy Greer), "and by human, I mean flawed, and by flawed, I mean freaks. Go get me some freaks."
 
  Specifically, because not only is he not above inciting drama, he's all about it, he instructs them to find him an Arab and a Jew. ("How about an Arab who's also a Jew?" one of them chirps.) The task is made relatively easy by the worldwide popularity of the show, and a rapping rabbi is soon procured as is a starry-eyed Iraqi named Omer (Sam Golzari), who at the beginning of the movie finds himself having a hard time at a terrorist-training camp in Afghanistan, where he spends his days getting in the way and his nights perfecting his show-tune routines.
 
  Desperate to get rid of him, his commanders ship him off to his wealthy cousins' house in Orange County, intending to call him into action never. From the moment he steps into their glossy McMansion, Omer is in heaven — even more so when he discovers that his flamboyant cousin Iqbal (Tony Yalda) has built himself a disco-era practice space in the basement, where he spends his days perfecting his audition for "American Dreamz." When the show's producers show up and find Omer trying out his moves (Iqbal is, as ever, at the mall), they know they've found their man. And when his commanders find out he's made the show, they know they've found their suicide bomber.
 
  Grant's second coming as a rake and an egotist is the best thing to happen to his career since "Four Weddings and a Funeral." He is twice as enjoyable as the preening bad guy as he was as the bumbling good guy, and Weitz makes perfect use of the new persona. Nobody likes Martin, least of all himself — which not only makes him enormously empathetic, it adds a delightful unexpected dimension to his relationship with Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore).
 
  Sally is Martin's Mini-Me in Carrie Underwood form. A small-town girl from Padookie, Ohio, Sally since childhood has been plotting her path to stardom with the help of her passive-aggressive stage mother (Jennifer Coolidge). If the role is a familiar one, Moore infuses it with a rage-fueled intensity that transforms it into something revelatory. Like Martin, Sally is a deeply unhappy individual who channels all her anger into her singular ambition. She thinks nothing of dispensing with her loyal, loving and dim-bulbed boyfriend, William Williams (Chris Klein), when he gets in her way, then roping him back in when he reveals himself as a useful PR tool. Klein is reliably pathetic as the hapless innocent, a role he has perfected and perhaps exhausted. But Moore brings a surprising dimension to Sally, whose onstage lightness masks a serious dark streak.
 
  There are many things to like about "American Dreamz," most notable of which is the relationship between Sally and Martin. The two meet anything but cute, and the relationship that develops — an attachment that springs from a mutual respect, horror and self-recognition — is as funny as it is weirdly affecting.
 
  Quaid is hilarious as the nation's child-president, who picks up the newspapers for the first time in his fifth year of office and learns to his surprise that there are "three kinds of Iraqistanis," and that they not only don't like each other, they bear little resemblance to Dr. Octopus and Magneto, as he's been told. Marcia Gay Harden is eerily soothing as his happy-pill dispensing wife, and Dafoe is excellent as a sort of Karl Rove in Dick Cheney drag. Neither Weitz nor Quaid hold back in their allusions to a certain elected official who doesn't read the papers, believes that he's in office because "the Lord picked him," and may or may not have at one time worn an earpiece during a debate.
 
  But ultimately, "American Dreamz" is an equal-opportunity lampooner, shrugging at a populace so distracted by trivia it spends its days cheerfully driving to the mall in combat-sized vehicles and practicing for its big break as bombs keep going off.
 
 'American Dreamz'

 
 MPAA rating:
 Rated PG-13 for brief strong language and some sexual references
 
 A Universal Pictures release. Writer-director Paul Weitz. Producers Rodney Liber, Andrew Miano. Director of photography Robert Elswit. Editor Myron Kerstein. Music by Stephen Trask. Running time: 1 ho   

There are many things a satire should be  fearless, scalding, revealing  and one it should probably not be: too easy. American Dreamz  is a political/media/showbiz parody so hungry to be topical that it looks, at first, like a case of deluded liberal Hollywood ''edge.'' Here's a movie in which the President of the United States, Joe Staton (Dennis Quaid), is a drawling, insulated cipher who can't tell a Sunni from a Shiite, and who takes his orders  his very thoughts  from his chief of staff, a bald schemer with a Cheneyesque crooked grimace (Willem Dafoe). In other words, he's a parody of George W. Bush that cuts no deeper than 100 sketches from the past five seasons of Saturday Night Live .
But wait! In an attempt to bolster the president's sagging approval ratings, he agrees to appear as a guest judge on American Dreamz , a popular musical reality show in which ordinary folks with a lust for fame blare histrionically ''sincere'' versions of pop songs, all to garner the approval of the show's host, Martin Tweed  an acid-tongued British supercad played, with a dollop of charming self-loathing, by Hugh Grant. If ridiculing George Bush as an idiot is old comic news, then sending up Simon Cowell for his adorable smarminess  or the American Idol  contestants for being shameless limelight junkies  is the height of redundancy. Throw in an Islamic terrorist (Sam Golzari) who lands on the show as a William Hung novelty act and gets ordered to blow up the president on national TV (even though he just wants to sing show tunes!), and you have a satire locked and loaded in its obviousness. The surprise of American Dreamz  is that it's a blithe, funny, and engaging movie, not because the targets are any subtler than they sound, but because writer-director Paul Weitz (About a Boy , In Good Company ) has made the shrewd move of staging the film on a human scale, in the homespun wackadoo spirit of a '40s screwball comedy. Rather than treating its characters as walking punchlines, American Dreamz  gets us to like them, reveling, from the inside, in their plasma-screen narcissism.
The movie asks the audience to sympathize with President Staton as he reacts to his puppet status by tumbling into a depression (and, for the first time, picking up a newspaper). Is this letting Bush off the hook? Not really: It's more a way of winking at the humanity of his passivity. Meanwhile, Tweed, on the hunt for new contestants, hits pay dirt when he finds Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), an adrenalized crooner who, with her chunky sexiness and trumped-up ''white trash'' roots, is like Kelly Clarkson with a dash of Britney. She's the most amoral conniver in the movie, and Grant and Moore have a wicked barbed chemistry as the host and contestant who despise and need each other. As the president gets ready to go on the show, wearing an earpiece that will feed him every line, we see that no one on screen, from Staton to Tweed to the contestants (who are offered up in a luscious parody of American Idol 's throaty, showboating ''individualism''), has presented themselves as they are. Yet the film's true target isn't these bogus celebrities and politicians. It's really us: the people  the audience  that make the new culture of American fakery possible.

 In "American Dreamz," a comedy about a faltering American president, a wildly popular TV talent show and the Svengalis behind them both, the jokes don't just fizzle into insignificance; they flop about with gaudy ineffectualness, gasping for air like newly landed trout. Unlike fish, alas, gags about nitwit commanders in chief, oily television hosts and rabidly ambitious young performers with stars in their eyes and sometimes their beds can't be tossed back in the water; only a blunt instrument, like a hammer, will do. Consider this a hammer, humanely but firmly applied.  Written and directed by Paul Weitz, whose earlier films include the boomer-revenge fantasy "In Good Company" and, with his brother, Chris Weitz, the sleekly entertaining adaptation of Nick Hornby's novel "About a Boy," "American Dreamz" is a seriously unfunny comedy about a seriously juicy subject, namely that intersection where politics meets entertainment. This isn't new, of course; Aristophanes bummed around that juncture, as did Elia Kazan. But what gives the film its gleam of topicality, its suggestion of relevance, is that it directly sends up both the Bush presidency and "American Idol," those twin pillars of contemporary homespun populism. The problem being that, as Jon Stewart, among many others, habitually reminds us, both surrendered to self-parody some time ago.  The film's strongest hand is Martin Tweed, or Tweedy, a television host cut along more or less the same sharp lines as the "American Idol" judge Simon Cowell and nicely played by Hugh Grant. In recent years, Mr. Grant has ditched his crinkly ingratiation to become the screen's reigning cad, an update on the jaundiced, self-loathing types once played by George Sanders. As the aggrieved host of the country's most popular show, "American Dreamz," Mr. Grant pulls out his shirttails, gels his hair into meringue peaks and roughs up his plummy accent, tempering his dissipated mien with some old-fashioned showbiz vulgarity. Even when he compares one yodeling contestant to the Ebola virus, he wields the gavel with a Beverly Hills smile.  Because Mr. Weitz has written a collection of profiles rather than a screenplay, "American Dreamz" has a baggy, episodic structure. Characters enter, sing a song or deliver a snatch of dialogue and exit; enter the next character, then the next. Those who stay around the longest, vying both for attention and purpose, are President Staton (Dennis Quaid), a Pinocchio with his own puppeteer (Willem Dafoe in a Dick Cheney tonsure as his chief of staff), and the Midwestern girl next door, Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore). A would-be Kelly Clarkson, Sally yearns for fame and all its dysfunctions, while the president suddenly just wants to read the newspapers, an undertaking so uncharacteristic that the chief of staff asks, "What's with all the papers — new puppy?"  The liverish-looking Mr. Dafoe gives this line a creepy edge, but it isn't the kind of funny that sticks, at least if you're over the age of 10. It's the sort of toothless gag that a fading Bob Hope used to toss off at the Oscars (take my president, please!) but is painfully out of sync with Mr. Weitz's larger ambitions. Like President Staton, who appears on "American Dreamz" to pump his sagging ratings, the filmmaker clearly wants to say something, anything. And, so, in addition to a Bush and Britney clone, he gives us Omer (Sam Golzari), an aspiring suicide bomber straight from the Middle East who, on landing in Southern California, seems willing to trade his dream of a glorious afterlife for a shot at network paradise.  Omer sounds like a bad idea and is, despite the winning efforts of Mr. Golzari. Beginning with "American Pie," Mr. Weitz's films have always benefited from strong ensembles, and the same holds true here. Along with its fine leads, "American Dreamz" features some top-notch supporting players, including John Cho and Judy Greer as Tweedy's sycophantic retainers, all of whom make the film more watchable than its screenplay and junky visuals deserve. The young actor Tony Yalda, who plays Omer's nouveau riche American cousin, Iqbal, also rates mention, largely because he invests his character, a Barbra Streisand-indebted diva without the requisite pipes, with feeling and not just fun. In his face, you see the dream of fame at its purest and most corrupting.  And there you have it, Mr. Weitz's big idea: transfixed by money and glitz,  lulled by a promise of celebrity so great it defuses even a suicide bomber, we have fallen into a stupor while the puppet-masters have seized the White House. Dude! I hear you, really I do. But where's the beef and, as important, where are the jokes, the heart and the understanding that every age creates its own variation on the American dream? No matter how orchestrated, like President Bush at his most aw-shucks sincere, "American Idol" represents the triumph of populism over elitism, specifically our triumph. We, the ultimate insiders, cling to the fiction that we are outsiders, struggling for a place in the sun we already have. We are such stuff as dreamz are made on.  "American Dreamz" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). But not too strongly cautioned.

A demonstration of how satire can booby-trap best intentions, Paul Weitz's "American Dreamz" responds to a host of post-9/11 issues and pop-culture phenomena with frantic miscalculation. Combining a gallery of targets including President Bush, "American Idol," the Iraq War and the overarching theme of a nation of citizens held in the thrall of phony dreams, pic and its ambitions are undermined by insistent cartoonishness and comic ineptitude. Tapping into the zeitgeist and a moviegoing public are far from the same thing, which inevitably flatlining B.O. and ancillary will bear out.
The idea of mixing and matching a recently re-elected incompetent prez (Dennis Quaid) with a reality show that pits aspiring pop singers against each other and is hosted by a smirking Brit (Hugh Grant) must have seemed terrif on the page. And with Weitz combining the stars of his previous two seriocomedies (Grant from "About a Boy" and Quaid from "In Good Company"), while channeling issues and pop obsessions, pic would appear to have more than enough meat for topical skewering.
Grant's Martin Tweed impresses as a ratings barracuda who will let nothing get in his way of his show, "American Dreamz," which tops the Nielsen charts. Three thousand miles away, Quaid's President Staton is depressively bedridden despite his electoral victory, and there's nothing the first lady (Marcia Gay Harden) or his intrusive chief of staff (Willem Dafoe) can do to shake him out it. Most disturbing to Dafoe's micromanaging worrywart is that Staton suddenly wants to read the paper and learn about the world.
Perhaps if the pic had focused primarily on these two leading men of Hollywood and Washington, each powerful in different ways, a steadier comic tone could have been found. But Weitz is out for a panorama of American life, and spreads his attention to include Sally Kendoo (Mandy Moore), a young Midwestern gal with star ambitions; and Omer (Sam Golzari), a terrorist recruit with a taste for show tunes who's assigned to a sleeper cell residing in the O.C.
"American Dreamz" gradually becomes four movies, all vying for attention, with the fourth being the most unwieldy. Adjusting to life with his upscale Arab-American relatives (including Shohreh Aghdashloo as the maternal Nazneen), Omer discovers Nazneen's gay teen son Iqbal (Tony Yalda) shares a love for Broadway and desperately wants to be on Tweed's show.
As the various narrative strands are messily curled, twisted and knotted, not only do the unlikely "American Dreamz" show finalists come down to Sally and Omer (ushering in some of the most starkly misjudged stereotypes of Arab characters in any recent Hollywood movie), but Staton wishes to serve as a guest judge on the season finale -- even as Omer's cell plans to kill him on the studio set.
Billy Wilder may have been able to make sense of this, but the twin challenges of taking cheeky swipes at such difficult and horrific issues as domestic terrorism while juggling a vast array of types overwhelms Weitz's better sensibilities.
Comic moments fall flat even as most of the cast emerges from the confusion quite respectably. Grant has seldom been more dislikable, yet it's this desire to smudge his own carefully built persona that makes the perf interesting. Quaid's Bushlike Staton is a lonely and confused man facing the limits of his own view of the world. Moore's is a pitch-perfect study of a woman for whom a reality show is
 reality.
A bald-pated Dafoe cleverly fuses Dick Cheney and Karl Rove as he scampers about the White House bedroom (the Oval Office is never seen), and Harden, with little to do, suggests a caring Laura Bush. Coolidge, Aghdashloo and Greer are wasted in underwritten roles. Arab activists eyeing stereotypes in Yank pop culture will have a field day with perfs of Mideast characters.
Production package is surprisingly average, given the talents of d.p. Robert Elswit, composer Stephen Trask and production designer William Arnold. In what may be a nod to topical '70s filmmaking, Elswit opts for a flashing technique that recalls vintage Vilmos Zsigmond.

Wanna knock the prez? Let's make a show. . . preferably on television. Paul Weitz 's new satire American Dreamz  imagines the Bush regime as an episode in the history of American entertainment and American Idol   as the quintessence of U.S. democracy. So what else is new?
The vision of America as a vast, ratings-driven amateur hour is not without promise, but Weitz's movie, named for the most popular TV program in its parallel universe, is disappointingly soft in its individual characterizations. Indeed, as befits a director whose slice of the American pie has been predicated on a self-proclaimed "franchise" of gross-out comedies, the movie is mainly about tolerance. (He knows, firsthand, that the American people have it.)
American Dreamz  is a movie with two world-historic players and a raft of wannabes. Host of the eponymous TV show, Hugh Grant  plays the role of the smarmy swine with convincing self-loathing. "I envy myself deeply," he tells his gorgeous girlfriend as she leaves him. Scouting new contestants, Grant actually finds one as callous as hean Ohio cheerleader (singer-actress Mandy Moore ) who is as eager to exploit her Iraq  warinjured boyfriend as she is to mimic Christina Aguilera .
Moore's ultimate rival is a Chorus Line loving Iraqi mujahid (avid newcomer Sam Golzari ) sent to America by his disgusted comrades as a sleeper agent who will never be activated. Installed at the Beverly Hills  home of his unsuspecting, bizarrely nouveau relatives, Golzari winds up on Grant's show. America is the land of opportunityhis queeny cousin submitted an audition tape, and when the show's representatives turn up, they take Golzari for the applicant. (Like Steven Spielberg  in Munich ' s second-worst scene, Weitz is pleased to exaggerate the appeal of American pop music for the Arab world.)
Meanwhile, America's president (Dennis Quaid ) has just been returned to office. In a paroxysm of rebelliousness, he elects to stay in bed and read a newspaper rather than meet the press. Harking back to the sitcom protag of Comedy Central 's That's My Bush!   the Weitz conception of our maximum leader as a timid moron is hardly unsympathetic. "My mom wanted to show my dad any idiot could do it," Quaid explains to his sweetly medicated wife (Marcia Gay Harden ), pushing the movie's talent show premise into the political realm.
As one might expect, too much information precipitates a presidential breakdown; Quaid is shown surrounded by books, with Benjamin Barber 's prophetic Jihad vs. McWorld  prominently positioned for the camera. Whether or not the president takes Barber's argument seriously, Weitz surely does: Barber's pre9-11 formulation, "When Jihad and McWorld collide on television, there is little doubt about who wins," turns out to be the movie's article of faith and deus ex machina. The president's controlling chief of staff (Willem Dafoe ), a combination of Karl Rove  and Dick Cheney , who in one of their funnier exchanges assures Quaid that "I'm there for you," wants to restore the president's plunging poll numbers by positioning him as a guest judge on Grant's show. At this point, the mujahideenwho, like everyone else in this universe, are addicted to American TVcatch Golzari's act and, realizing that he has a chance to go all the way, designate him their suicide contestant.
The eerie spectacle of a jihadist prancing through "The Impossible Dream" notwithstanding, American Dreamz  should really have been funnier. But it's not boring. Paddling vigorously through some mid-movie doldrums, Weitz unexpectedly brings everything together for a suitably madcap finale involving multiple betrayals and malfunctions, a remote-controlled president, starstruck terrorists, and an on-air marriage proposal. It's not exactly The Manchurian Candidate , but the whole world is watching. Golzari's rendition of "My Way" is nearly equaled by a heartfelt plea to "deal with reality" (including the admission that Middle East problems will never be solved). As if to prove the point, Weitz detonates a suicide bomb as a punchline.
To make its point, however, American Dreamz could not possibly be insulting enough. (Compared to the genuinely illiberal Team America , this is a love patdespite Trey Parker 's cameo as a doomed contestant, the long-haired "Rocky Man.") Quaid's president is neither the petulant charmer we know and loathe nor the vain and cunning Bush of David Hare 's heroic docudrama Stuff Happens although perhaps Weitz did see Hare's play when it was staged in Los Angeles last summer. At any rate, American Dreamz  poses the same essential question: "To what degree is this country culpable for its actions?" the dancing mujahid wonders. "Are Americans responsible for America?"
Ultimately, American Dreamz  is less social satire than social realismthe contestants are virtually indistinguishable from those on the real American Idol ; the pols are as comfortingly stupid as we might wish them to be. Bottom line and end of the day: American Dreamz  is still flattering. The movie may have been made with the barest modicum of style and taste, but it is never as crass as its presumed audience.
