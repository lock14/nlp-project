Let's get reality out of the way. Juno  is about  and the quirky first name of  an independent-minded high school virgin (Ellen Page) who freely chooses to have sex with her pal and fellow outsider, Bleeker (Michael Cera). Contraception is not used; the girl becomes pregnant. Juno is fortunate to have a supportive and loving father (J.K. Simmons) and stepmother (Allison Janney), a true-blue best friend (Olivia Thirlby), access to a safe and legal abortion, and the right to choose whether to continue or terminate her pregnancy, with Bleeker's unwavering support. She chooses to continue, and to give the baby up for adoption. Juno  would have been a very different movie had the young woman named for the queen of Roman gods chosen termination and brought her admirable young female clarity to that less gentle, more divisive decision  maybe truer, certainly not so funny.
But director Jason Reitman and screenwriter Diablo Cody really don't give a hoot what you think about the right to life/right to choose/right to make jokes about teen sex. Their movie, a blithe charmer balanced somewhere between a life-should-be-so-neat fairy tale and a life's-a-real-bitch tragicomedy, leaves political debate at the ticket counter and focuses solely on what it's like for Juno MacGuff to be Juno MacGuff. And damned if the girl, as played by Hard Candy 's radiantly no-nonsense Page, isn't who every whip-smart young moviegoing woman cheered by My So-Called Life , Freaks and Geeks , Daria , and the graphic novels of Daniel Clowes ought to aspire to be. Minus the unprotected sex.
In truth,  Juno  begins at such a pitch of hyperverbal smart-mouthing, not only by the title character but also by everyone around her, that it takes about a half hour for the movie's long-term plans to make tolerable sense and for the laugh-baiting banter to calm down. Some of this is Reitman's doing, beginning with the bright, sunshiny (and Little Miss Sunshine -y) colors and tempo of his antiheroine's Sunny D-swigging march to a drugstore to purchase yet another pregnancy test. But more of the responsibility belongs to young Ms. Cody, clearly a writer of unique sass herself, who proudly proffers her stint as a Minneapolis phone-sex operator/insurance adjuster as a PR hook. Sometimes she just can't help adding an extra serving of cute. ''This is one doodle that can't be undid, home skillet,'' the chatty drugstore guy (The Office 's Rainn Wilson) chirps when Juno announces the pink positive sign on the test stick. ''Silencio , old man,'' she tells him. (I can just about see the words on the script page, but not out of a stressed girl's mouth.) Soon, Juno considers her choices. ''I'm just calling to procure a hasty abortion,'' she says on the phone to one clinic. The handset she uses is a novelty shape, but that's not enough. ''I'm on my hamburger phone,'' she explains, for the chance to say ''hamburger phone.''
The student who describes herself as a ''cautionary whale'' is a hip pip all right. And Superbad 's Cera, dressed for maximum post-ironic giggles in flappy little phys ed shorts and head-and-wrist sweatbands, makes Bleeker the kind of pre-cool treasure that a discerning high school girl ought to keep her eye on. But the movie's biggest surprise, and reward, turns out to be the maturity and appreciation with which Cody and Reitman handle the grown-ups in the mix  the adults for whom Juno's choice carries as much, or even more, importance. I don't think Jennifer Garner has ever been lovelier or more affecting than in her turn as Vanessa, one-half of the childless married couple looking to adopt whose advertisement in the local PennySaver Juno answers. Vanessa ardently longs for motherhood. She's a tucked-in, successful corporate type bursting to fulfill her true calling by loving a child, and her husband Mark (Jason Bateman) appears, for a while, to be on the same page. Then again, Mark is also a very familiar breed of grown-up boy-man still wistful for his old days back with his comic books. He's wistful for the very youth Juno MacGuff still has.
Truth: The old-school feminist in me wishes Juno  spent more time, even a tart sentence or two, acknowledging that the options taken for granted by this one attractive, articulate teen are in fact hard-won, precious rights, and need to be guarded by a new-generation army of Junos and Bleekers, spreading the word by text message as well as by hamburger phone. Separate but equal truth: This movie is so delightful and good-hearted a portrait of the kind of new-generation army I'd like to hang with that I accept the admonition ''Silencio , old woman.''

 Juno MacGuff, the title character of Jason Reitman’s new film, is 16 and pregnant, but “Juno” could not be further from the kind of hand-wringing, moralizing melodrama that such a condition might suggest. Juno, played by the poised, frighteningly talented Ellen Page, is too odd and too smart to be either a case study or the object of leering disapproval. She assesses her problem, and weighs her response to it, with disconcerting sang-froid.  It’s not that Juno treats her pregnancy as a joke, but rather that in the sardonic spirit of the screenwriter, Diablo Cody, she can’t help finding humor in it. Tiny of frame and huge of belly, Juno utters wisecracks as if they were breathing exercises, referring to herself as “the cautionary whale.”  At first her sarcasm is bracing and also a bit jarring — “Hello, I’d like to procure a hasty abortion,” she says when she calls  a women’s health clinic — but as “Juno” follows her from pregnancy test to delivery room (and hastily retreats from the prospect of abortion), it takes on surprising delicacy and emotional depth. The snappy one-liners are a brilliant distraction, Ms. Cody’s way of clearing your throat for the lump you’re likely to find there in the movie’s last scenes.  The first time I saw “Juno,” I was shocked to find myself tearing up at the end, since I’d spent the first 15 minutes or so gnashing my teeth and checking my watch. The passive-aggressive pseudo-folk songs, the self-consciously clever dialogue, the generic, instantly mockable suburban setting — if you can find Sundance on a map, you’ll swear you’ve been here before.  But “Juno” (which played at the Telluride and Toronto film festivals, not the one in Park City, Utah) respects the idiosyncrasies of its characters rather than exaggerating them or holding them up for ridicule. And like Juno herself, the film outgrows its own mannerisms and defenses, evolving from a coy, knowing farce into a heartfelt, serious comedy.  A good deal of the credit for this goes to Ms. Page, a 20-year-old Canadian who is able to seem, in the space of a single scene, mature beyond her years and disarmingly childlike. The naïveté that peeks through her flippant, wised-up facade is essential, since part of the movie’s point is that Juno is not quite as smart or as capable as she thinks she is.  It’s not simply that she has impulsive, unprotected sex with her friend Paulie Bleeker (Michael Cera), or that she decides, against the advice of parents and friends, to have the baby and give it up for adoption. These, indeed, are choices she is prepared to defend and to live with. Rather, Juno’s immaturity resides in her familiar adolescent assumption that she understands the world better than her elders do, and that she can finesse the unintended consequences of her decisions.  The grown-ups, at first, seem like familiar caricatures of adolescent-centered cinema: square, sad and clueless. But Juno’s father (J. K. Simmons) and step-mother (Allison Janney) turn out to be complicated, intelligent people, too, and not just because they are played by two of the best character actors around. Ms. Cody’s script and Mr. Reitman’s understated, observant direction allow the personalities of the characters to emerge slowly, and to change in credible and unpredictable ways.  This is especially true of Mark (Jason Bateman) and Vanessa (Jennifer Garner), the baby’s potential adoptive parents. The audience’s initial impression of them, like Juno’s, is of stereotypically smug yuppies trapped in rickety conventions of heterosexual domesticity. Vanessa is uptight and materialistic, while Mark tends the guttering flame of his youthful hipness, watching cult horror movies and trading alternative-rock mix CDs with Juno.  Juno is, on the surface at least, a familiar type, surrounding herself with and expressing herself by means of kitschy consumer detritus (she calls the clinic on a hamburger phone) and pop cultural ephemera. She could be the hero of a Judd Apatow comedy (like, say, Mr. Cera, the boneless wonder of “Superbad” and a purely delightful presence here). Except, of course, that she’s female. Ms. Cody, Mr. Reitman and Ms. Page have conspired, intentionally or not, to produce a feminist, girl-powered rejoinder and complement to “Knocked Up.” Despite what most products of the Hollywood comedy boys’ club would have you believe,  it is possible to possess both a uterus and a sense of humor.  “Juno” also shares with “Knocked Up” an underlying theme, a message that is not anti-abortion but rather pro-adulthood. It follows its heroine — and by the end she has earned that title — on a twisty path toward responsibility and greater self-understanding.  This is the course followed by most coming-of-age stories,  though not many  are so daring in their treatment of teenage pregnancy, which this film flirts with presenting not just as bearable but attractive. Kids, please! Heed the cautionary whale.  But in the meantime, have a good time at “Juno.” Bring your parents, too.  “Juno” is,  somewhat remarkably,  rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has sexual situations, obviously, but no nudity or violence and not much swearing.
Juno  marks the second film for director Jason Reitman  and the first for screenwriter Diablo Cody , author of the Pussy Ranch blog, which, surprisingly, has very little to do with baby kittens. Reitman, having made his debut with a swaggering adaptation of Christopher Buckley 's Thank You for Smoking , is said to have done little to Cody's screenplay about a too-smart teen preggers with a baby she's planning to give away to a barren couple of yups; word is, the final script isn't so different from the first draft even, which is mighty impressive once you get past the early-going rough patches that are more Wes Anderson  than even Wes Anderson could imagine. With The Kinks ' "Well-Respected Man" blaring on the soundtrack in the first 15 minutes, you're likely to get the indie-film shakes.
At first, Juno threatens to choke on its quotation-marks catchphraseslike when The Office 's Rainn Wilson, cameoing as a convenience-store clerk, tells 16-year-old Juno MacGuff  (Ellen Page ) that her positive pregnancy test is "one doodle that can't be undid, home skillet." Or when Olivia Thirlby , as Juno's best cheerleading pal Leah, uses "Phuket , Thailand " as an expletive. Or when Juno describes the perfect adoptive parents as a "cool graphic designer, mid-thirties, with a cool Asian girlfriend who totally rocks the bass but I don't want to be too particular." Our heroine also digs McSweeney's , Iggy and the Stooges, and Dario Argento 's Suspiria . Arch? Argh, yes.
But after a little while, the movie calms down and finds its centerno, its heart , which already sets it apart from the cutesy-quirky realm of Anderson, for whom ticks and affectations have replaced deliberation and emotion. Indeed, once it works its way through the first-timer's lookatme!  snark, Juno evolves into a thing of beauty and grace. By the end, it's unexpectedly moving without ever once trolling for crocodile tears. It's a sneak attack.
Juno begins to soar when Juno tells her father Mac (J.K. Simmons ) and stepmother Bren (Allison Janney ) that she's pregnant. Juno thought about getting an abortion, but couldn't do itthe clinic was too drab, its patients too hopeless, its receptionist too thoughtless. She doesn't decide to have the kid to make a statement; she just can't be bothered to stick it out in the most depressing waiting room on earth. So Juno spills it to her folks, who'd hoped that, oh, maybe their little girl was on drugs or had been popped for a DWI.
It takes all of two seconds for them to come around. Mac can't believe that nebbishy high-school track star Paulie Bleeker  (Michael Cera ) is the dad: "Didn't think he had it in him." And Bren, a nail-salon tech, wants Juno on prenatal vitamins pronto: "They do great things for your nails, which is a plus." That one living-room scene, so low-key (to the point where it almost seems normal) and thoughtful and sweet and simple, comes at just the right moment. Just when it feels as though Reitman and Cody are losing their wrestling match with the tone and texture, just when it feels like Juno 's about to wink and nudge itself off the screen, it coalesces into a perfect movie about responsibility, maturity, and unconditional love.
Juno decides to have the child and give it to a couple desperate for a babyin this case, Mark and Vanessa Loring  (Jason Bateman  and Jennifer Garner ). Vanessa especially wants a child, and Garner delivers an unexpectedly poignant performancedidn't know she had this in her. For a long while, we have no idea as to what to make of Vanessa. Cody and Reitman portray her initially as coldly WASP-perfect, all pearls and pleats; she's got no sense of humor. There's something even a little creepy about the Lorings, who've placed their baby-wanted ad in the PennySaver . They're the Stepford Couple in a prefab McMansion a million miles from the warm embrace of the cluttered, middle-class MacGuff household.
It seems Mark and Juno are the kindred spirits, rockers and horror-film fans bound by their love of gore and guitars. They even fall in love, just a little bit to where, yeah, it's almost creepy. But Mark's more boy than man, a Cobain wannabe in dirty teesand a poor substitute for Paulie, already more of a man than Mark. Vanessa's the Loring to whom Juno's really bound, and Garner conveys a vast, lonely ache with just a heartbreaking wince when Juno points to her own ever-swelling belly and says, "You're lucky it's not you."
I've seen Juno three times since its debut at the Toronto International Film Festival , and it only gets better with each viewing. The performances are so subtle that it takes a while to notice how terrific they all are. After three movies spent barking at Peter Parker  from beneath a comic-book flattop, Simmons especially is a revelation. And Page, channeling Linda Cardellini 's character on Freaks and Geeks  , finds her way intoand past, way  pastthose early clever-clever lines, burrowing deep into Juno's skin till she finds her soul.
