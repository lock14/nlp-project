I remember going to see American Gigolo  in 1980 and being disappointed when the film turned out to offer sleek alienation, angled white architecture, Richard Gere looking mannequin-fabulous in Armani  everything but good old down-and-dirty sex. Spread , starring Ashton Kutcher as an L.A. lady-killer with no job and no home, who moves in with the women he beds until they figure out he's using them, doesn't repeat American Gigolo 's high-minded mistake. It's full of tawny writhing bodies, one of which belongs to Anne Heche, in one of those thankless, lonely-corporate-vixen-looking-for-love roles. She hooks up with Kutcher, and even after she discovers him cheating on her, she doesn't kick the bum out. Sex with this dude is just, you know, too hot .
In Spread , there's no denying that Kutcher has the heartless sex appeal, the killer pickup moves, the conversation-as-market-tested-sound-bite manipulativeness of L.A. sleaze down pat. The whole movie is pat  very pleased with itself for being so up front about the ways of a 21st-century man-whore. I was with Kutcher's portrayal of a sociopathic stud, until he met his match. That's right: He tries to work his lewd magic on a girl (Margarita Levieva) who's Just Like Him, at which point we have to spend the entire second half of the movie watching him develop ''feelings.'' Is there anything soggier than a cad redeemed?


 When Nikki (Ashton Kutcher), a lanky, arrogant Hollywood stud, confides his secrets of seduction to the camera early in “Spread,” you wonder if this might be the breakthrough movie in which a male hustler is not required to pay for his sins.  We’re in the 21st century, after all. And Nikki, and the women on whom he preys (he has no home or car) operate on a level playing field where the combatants are buffeted without suffering mortal wounds or moral disgrace. The rules of the game are roughly the same as those in “Entourage” and “Californication.” Casual opportunistic sex practiced by beautiful people of both sexes is an easy-come, easy-go transaction. Each month, Nikki estimates, 30,000 hot young things arrive in Hollywood prepared for battle.  Mr. Kutcher, who sprawls around half-naked through much of the movie, exudes a goofy, rakish charm, but “Spread,” directed by David Mackenzie (“Young Adam”) from a screenplay by Jason Dean Hall, doesn’t attach to him a coherent story. Near the beginning of the film, he hooks up with Samantha (Anne Heche) a skinny, high-powered lawyer with a Mercedes and a sleek home in the Hollywood Hills that she boasts was once occupied by Peter Bogdanovich. In their moderately steamy nude sex scenes all over the property, they do it in a variety of positions. Midway in their affair, she undergoes vaginal rejuvenation surgery.  When Samantha goes to New York on business, Nikki, temporary lord of the manor, gives a party in her absence attended by other vacant, hard-bodied sybarites. Even after she returns just in time to catch him being serviced by a girl in a football helmet as they watch a game on television, Samantha remains unflappably in control, and their arrangement continues for a while longer.  “Spread” begins to crumble when Nikki meets Heather (Margarita Levieva), a beautiful young waitress who plays the same games he does. But as a character, Heather, who lies about almost everything, doesn’t add up. If she is the plaything of a wealthy New Yorker (who as glimpsed late in the movie is just as handsome as Nikki), what is she doing waiting tables in a Los Angeles diner? And why does Nikki fall for her? Is he captivated by a reflection of himself? And what kind of love is that? And why, if he is such a confident grifter, does he have nothing to show for it?  The movie’s lurking Puritanism is evidenced by the difference between Nikki’s explicit scenes with Samantha and his encounters with Heather. When love (if that’s the right word) is involved, “Spread” becomes so blushingly modest, it can hardly bring itself to show the sweethearts kissing, much less locking limbs.  More skin is shown in “Spread” than in most Hollywood movies. But despite twitches of insight into its characters and their world, “Spread” refuses go more than skin deep.  “Spread” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, nudity and profanity.

With "Shampoo" and "American Gigolo" now distant memories, the time evidently seemed ripe for another Hollywood stud movie. Despite Ashton Kutcher�s believability as an older woman�s kept boy, "Spread" isn�t a patch on those previous films, squandering initial goodwill on a forced, desultory final act. Kutcher�s name and some fairly hot action give this a viable shot at a theatrical fling, but staying power is suspect. International prospects seem good.
You see them all the time in Hollywood, the golden boys with great good looks and toned bods and no apparent cares in the world who hang around clubs and pools. They almost invariably look vapid as hell and quite without character, which is probably why they do what they do instead of becoming successful actors. 
The initial appeal of "Spread" is that the voiceover commentary of just such an airhead, Nicki (Kutcher), promises to expose the inner workings of these guys� mysterious minds. As he makes the party rounds one night, Nicki goes on and on about his predatory calculations: how he sizes up his prey, what poses and attitudes he strikes and how to snare a rich older woman so she�ll support him even if he misbehaves with young babes.
If such uncensored self-revelation had persisted through the whole movie, Brit director David Mackenzie and writer Jason Dean Hall might have brought something fresh to the table with this all-too predictable cautionary tale; why not make a film about a guy who really does have it all figured out, rather than about a cocky young hustler who just thinks he does and requires a comeuppance to pay the price for his arrogance?
Pic�s flash and Nicki�s audacious juggling of hot little numbers are distracting for a while. Looking for the easy life, lanky, diffident Nicki latches on to Samantha (Anne Heche), a lady in her early 40s with a fabulous Hollywood Hills home ("Peter Bogdanovich used to live here," she notes), well preserved looks, obvious resources and a pulsing libido. 
Once she�s hooked, Samantha takes off for New York for a few days, whereupon Nicki promptly throws a big party at her house for all his scenester friends. Director Mackenzie showed a knack for staging rugged sex in "Young Adam," and the randy interludes between Kutcher, Heche and others goes beyond the Hollywood norm. 
But the pic�s downward spiral starts as soon as the plot machinery kicks in -- Samantha and Nicki argue and screw their way toward the inevitable split, Nicki falls for a female version of himself, Heather (Margarita Levieva), then wonders where he went wrong. All that�s missing is a wrap-up theme song, "What�s It All About, Nicki?"
For all of Nicki�s initial confidentiality with the audience, too many questions go unanswered: If he�s so expert at what he does, why does he have absolutely nothing to show for it? He seems to have his strategy for conquest down to a science, but what�s his long-range game plan? How can he decline so quickly that he can�t employ his old tricks anymore? 
The pic reveals the palpable pressure to resolve matters pressing heavily on a screenwriter who opted for an unsatisfactory shortcut to an ending.
Kutcher�s fine as far as things go, but the script aborts its early stab at real character revelation. Supporting players are able, but the pic could have used a greater array of Hollywood types to provide a richer canvas. While tech contributions are solid, Mackenzie provides a less distinctive view of Los Angeles than have numerous other foreign directors over the years.
Viewers should make a point of sticking around through the end credits scroll, which is truly unique.


Broke-ass hustler Nikki (Ashton Kutcher , who also produced) may not have a home or a car, but he does possess "six inches and a pretty face," in the words of his latest conquest, Samantha (Anne Heche ), a 40-ish corporate lawyer with a fantastic house in the Hollywood Hills . Director David Mackenzie , best known for 2003's coitus-heavy Young Adam , and first-time screenwriter Jason Hall  make sure Nikki's half-footer services Samantha (before she has vaginal-rejuvenation surgery) in many different positions on several pieces of furniture—scenes that generate about as much heat as reading Alex Witchel 's recent obsessive recapitulation of Heche getting her hair and makeup done in The New York Times Magazine  . Nikki, like fellow L.A. opportunist Joe Gillis  in Sunset Boulevard , provides first-person voiceover, with Kutcher's drone registering as neither sardonic send-up nor consistently fanged takedown of Lotusland. Instead, as Nikki falls for Heather (Margarita Levieva ), a player herself, Spread  becomes a sloggy, tepid comeuppance tale. Though the end credits feature an inspired bit of nastiness, Spread  might best be remembered for Nikki's horrible kept-man fashion sense: His keffiyeh and skinhead suspenders are a far cry from Richard Gere 's Armani suits in American Gigolo —and Joe Dallesandro 's skin-hugging raglan T-shirts and polyester pants in Heat .
