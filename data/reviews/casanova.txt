Heath Ledger is currently giving an uncommonly soulful performance as a lovelorn gay cowboy in ''Brokeback Mountain." The only reason to sneak from that movie into ''Casanova," Ledger's other holiday picture, is to confirm that he hasn't lost his ability to smile, or his appetite for women.
With that settled, you should feel free to head back to the heartbreak of ''Brokeback" and avoid the dopiness afoot here.
Ledger is not playing just any cad. He's playing, to paraphrase Elizabeth Taylor in ''Butterfield 8," the slut of all time -- or at least of 18th-century Europe. Unfortunately, ''Casanova" is not a sex flick or even a plausible romance. It's a cartoon.
In his day (he died at 73 in 1798), Casanova was a soldier, clergyman, memoirist, aristocrat, ex-con, and spy. He played the violin and brought the lottery to Paris.
Ledger brings a terrific blend of slyness and virility to the role of an unstoppable, bewigged libertine whose conquests include an entire nunnery. Notoriety gets him into hot holy water with the Catholic Church. If he doesn't find a respectable wife, he'll be expelled from Venice.
So he and his manservant, Lupo (Omid Djalili), scour the city for a suitable bride and find Victoria (Natalie Dormer), a milky virgin who can't wait for Casanova to deflower her. Of course, the male virgin across the way, Giovanni (Charlie Cox), thinks he called ''shotgun" first and proceeds, in a rare amusing scene, to give Casanova a jealous slap with a glove.
Conveniently, it's Giovanni's sister, Francesca, who has truly caught Casanova's fancy. She's an outspoken intellectual and huge fan of a best-selling writer banned for feminist ideas. Francesca is played with occasional brio by Sienna Miller, an actress more famous for enduring the indiscretions of her real-life Casanova, Jude Law.
Casanova would have his conquest were Francesca not already engaged to a rich stranger -- a lard magnate fresh off the boat from Genoa and played by Oliver Platt. He's the movie's only genuine surprise: mild-mannered, effeminate, and big enough to participate in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.
Casanova winds up juggling several false identities and two women, all while avoiding the sniveling Vatican inquisitor (Jeremy Irons, in a hideous wig) who's arrived to prosecute, then execute, ''moral heretics."
While it purports to celebrate free thinking, ''Casanova" is woefully lacking sensuality or, for that matter, sex. Director Lasse Hallstr�m and his screenwriters take a relentlessly adolescent approach to their subject. One scene, in which Victoria teases Casanova from under a table, suggests ''Benny Hill" on the WB.
The movie treats trysting as comedy and yet is stingy with the laughs. An action-packed life is now the chaste story of a rake whose romantic reformation is supposed to make us swoon. Must love dog? No thanks.

         Not since Nicole Kidman followed the Camille-like dance hall entertainer of "Moulin Rouge!" with "The Hours," in which she portrayed Virginia Woolf, no less, has a star attempted such a stretch with such success as Heath Ledger, who has gone from playing a taciturn, tormented gay cowboy in "Brokeback Mountain" to the title role of Disney's scintillating "Casanova" (which opens Sunday), the tireless 18th century seducer of countless beautiful women. Like Kidman, Ledger is equally engaging and convincing in both roles, and adds further testament to the charisma and protean talent and versatility of a roster of young Australian actors, which includes most notably Russell Crowe, who have risen to Hollywood's highest ranks.
 
  In essence, Lasse Hallström's elegant, dizzying romantic comedy, written by various hands, suggests that life in Venice in the age of Casanova had become a full-time masquerade, in which sybaritic aristocrats are rarely what they seem. Nonstop intrigue and seduction amid the scheming and the ambitious pave the way for the film's most amusing conceit: that the man who figures that the 10,000 pages of his manuscript equal the number of his sexual conquests is perhaps but myth and that he furthermore lost his heart to the one woman, the fiery proto-feminist Francesca (ravishing Sienna Miller), who did not automatically fall under his spell.
 


         






    Francesca is the daughter of the elegant, witty but impoverished widow Andrea Bruni (a scene-stealing Lena Olin), who insists that her daughter be married off to a wealthy Genoese lard merchant (Oliver Platt, wonderfully droll) whose business is echoed all too obviously by his vast rotundity. Spurned, vengeful lovers thicken the plot, which comes to a head with the arrival of Bishop Pucci (Jeremy Irons), a Vatican inquisitor all set to tackle heresy and licentiousness with great, purse-lipped zeal.
 
  Amid the baroque splendors of Venice, scheming and trickery escalate at a dizzying rate, and this effervescent film would burst like a soap bubble had Hallström not been able to maintain a lively pace and an irrepressible verve. Ironically, "Brokeback Mountain" and "Casanova," so different in time, place, style and tone, actually connect on the important level of freedom of sexual expression. In the exhilarating "Casanova," giddy shenanigans effectively set off the dangerous, darker impulses of human nature.

 I must confess that I watched the opening scenes of "Casanova" with some trepidation. A movie that begins with a man in a billowy linen shirt writing with a quill pen by candlelight, accompanied by a plummy voice-over - a "feather film," as my predecessor Vincent Canby  might have said - is rarely headed anywhere very interesting. To make matters worse, this was also "a film by Lasse Hallstrom," a talented enough director, but one whose recent efforts have been more concerned with Quality than with art or insight or surprise. So I sighed and sank down in my seat, preparing for a long, perfumed coach ride to Prestigeville.  Imagine my surprise, then, when "Casanova" turned out to be not a bewigged and brocaded white elephant, but rather a lively, sly and altogether charming farce. Dispensing with the suffocating conventions of the historical biopic, Mr. Hallstrom and the screenwriters, Jeffrey Hatcher and Kimberly Simi (assisted, it has been reported, by an uncredited Tom Stoppard), make liberal and intelligent use of the literary styles and attitudes of the 18th century, when their story takes place. While it takes a few cues from Casanova's notoriously untrustworthy memoirs, "Casanova" seems more directly inspired by the lighthearted, madcap comedies of near contemporaries like Pierre Marivaux and Casanova's fellow Venetian, Carlo Goldoni.  In following those theatrical models, the film feels at once historically faithful and breezily, even pointedly modern. The conflicts that propel its crazy, fusilli-like plot - between pleasure and restraint, between religious repression and sexual freedom, between candor and hypocrisy - are hardly obsolete. Venice in 1753 is in the midst of its own culture war, pitting the bureaucrats of the Inquisition against assorted feminists, philosophers and fornicators, and principally against Casanova, who is all of the above and then some.  He is also a man of mystery, known to his fellow Venetians by reputation rather than by face. Moviegoers will recognize him, of course, as Heath Ledger, the mumbling ranch hand from "Brokeback Mountain," and Mr. Ledger's status as the pansexual art-house heartthrob of the season will only be enhanced by this nimble performance. Whereas Donald Sutherland, in "Fellini's Casanova" back in 1976, played the man as a louche, melancholy degenerate, Mr. Ledger's version is more carefree and less complicated. He speaks softly, squares his shoulders, and the bodices pretty much rip themselves. (One virginal young lady is so overcome by his manly good looks that she reduces a bird cage to splinters.)  But the doge of Venice is under pressure from Rome to clean up his city, and so Casanova is commanded to marry or face banishment. At the same time, a spirited woman named Francesca Bruni (Sienna Miller) is rebelling against the arranged marriage that her widowed mother (Lena Olin) is forcing on her. Francesca's brother, Giovanni (Charlie Cox), is in love with the bird-cage smasher, whom Casanova is courting under an assumed name. There is a duel, and Casanova finds himself smitten - literally! - by Francesca's swordsmanship, as well as by her other charms. She, meanwhile, leads her own double life, publishing tracts on sexual equality under a male pseudonym and debating Casanova on the nature of love.  The movie ascends from pleasant comedy into true farce with the arrival of two out-of-towners. One, a Genoese lard merchant (Oliver Platt) who seems to be sculptured out of what he sells, is Francesca's intended husband, whom Casanova and his manservant (the brilliantly droll Omid Djalili) deflect from the romantic purpose of his trip. Meanwhile, the ruthless Bishop Pucci has come to Venice in the person of Jeremy Irons, a vision of decadent righteousness in purple silk breeches and a ginger-colored flat-top mullet wig.  Mr. Irons, who played the title role in last year's "Merchant of Venice," seems to be making a habit of spending Christmas in that city, something for which we can all be thankful. Pucci's villainy, while ridiculous, also supplies "Casanova" with a few necessary notes of gravity, since there is nothing funny about religious authority that punishes the pursuit of pleasure with torture and death. On the other hand, the best way to defeat such power is to laugh at it, which Mr. Irons and the rest of the cast do with effortless silliness.  Mr. Hallstrom's good taste also proves to be an asset. His direction is brisk and efficient, rather than insistently anarchic, and his visual gags are engineered with sly understatement. Of particular note is a perfectly simple wide shot of Mr. Platt sitting in a gondola, an image whose naughty wit may take a moment to sink in. And while the film is appropriately sexy, it is rarely vulgar or prurient. The most risqué bit is a moment of what might politely be called ocular intercourse. It occurs between Mr. Platt and Ms. Olin  and stands in for the more vigorous variety, which is kept mainly off screen.  In any case, what is on screen is a delightful respite from awards-season seriousness - a feather film, you might say, that actually tickles.  "Casanova" is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has many sexual scenes and references, none of them terribly explicit.
"He's a sperm-filled waxwork with the eyes of a masturbator," declared Fellini by way of explaining his choice of Donald Sutherland  to play the title role in his 1976 Casanova  . As the 18th-century Venetian memoirist, diplomat, escape artist, spy, military man, musician, Freemason, fraudster, clergyman, convicted witch, inveterate name-dropper, and definitive loverman, Sutherland is master of a bedroom technique more vigorous than many a gym regimen. His Casanova emanates a sweetish decaying scent of venereal melancholy and late-Fellini mustiness from beneath his Fabergé egg  costumery; despite his conquests, he remains utterly alone.
Needless to say, a Casanova  financed by a Disney  subsidiary and helmed by the director of Chocolat  produces a less complicated, more tasteful creature. Instead of Sutherland's militarized thrusts, this Casanova (Heath Ledger ) dips fruit in cream and murmurs single entendres; instead of compulsions and depressions, he has a backstory. Maternal abandonment has left the poor lad in search of sublimated mommy love; his intuition for traditional values holds firm notwithstanding his youthful rumspringa  of dashing promiscuity. Though his mighty sword has pierced every last vow of chastity in a local convent, he's really a closet monogamisthe just hasn't met the right girl.
She is Francesca (blah Sienna Miller ), who pens bestselling feminist tracts under a masculine nom de plume and dons drag to gain access to the all-male university. Fran and Giac are well matched in their casual facility for assuming and disposing of names and identities; forever in debt and afoul of the church (to wit: "Casanova, the Inquisition is here looking for you"), the notcher of belts acquires one fiancée too many, leading to the inevitable Mrs. Doubtfire  scene in which the Cassmaster must squire both his intendeds to a party, where he enjoys a perhaps requisite beneath-the-table servicing of Li'l Casanova. He finally reveals himself to Francesca on a blue-screen balloon trip that looks like an outtake from Bedknobs and Broomsticks . In the meantime, Lena Olin  wrings her hands as Francesca's uptight mom, Oliver Platt  waddles about as Casanova's wealthy gull, and Jeremy Irons  cashes a check as the evil bishop in flattop wig festooned with red Annie curls.
Ledger's deadpan baritone pumps wit into his tepid one-liners like collagen into a wilted starlet's kisser, and the clumsy staging might not grate so much if the tone weren't so self-congratulatory. Casanova 's undaunted support for women's education and spunky disdain for the Inquisition make Chocolat 's homilies in defense of candy and different-ness seem positively revolutionary.
