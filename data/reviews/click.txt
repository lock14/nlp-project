Death scenes translate into comedy gold about as often as public screenings of The Day the Clown Cried
 occur. Granted, the rare auteurist bloodbath (Peter Jackson's Dead Alive
, Michael Jackson's "Thriller") can scrounge genuine yuks from the gravest of situations, but as a rule, no one's laughing at doleful Macbeth despite the fact that, more and more, the Three Witches et al. feel as though they shambled straight out of one of the Coen brothers' more fabulist outings. Sandler, late of both Saturday Night Live
 and a promising dramatic turn with director Paul Thomas Anderson (which apparently led nowhere special), gets his big queasy scene in Click
, and it's a doozy all right. Having fast-forwarded through the best parts of his own life thanks to a magical, universal remote control, courtesy of Bed Bath & Beyond's queerest employee, Morty (Walken, who to no one's surprise heads the "Beyond" department), Sandler's rat-racing architect, Michael Newman, withered by age and regret, literally crawls through a driving rainstorm toward his forgotten family, dying all the way and desperate for one final connection. The whole sequence, grimmer than an empty mailbox on Father's Day in hell, is calculated to badger the tears from your eyes, and it almost does. But what got to me wasn't the character's predicament � I haven't forgotten George Bailey's Wonderful Life
 lessons anymore than you have � but the sheer gall of the filmmakers and star who, by this point in the film, have managed to turn a splendid (if obvious) storyline into something that feels as phony as a prefab cardboard casket. (There is one momentary burst of gravitas-shattering anti-hilarity in this scene, but it barely survives the ensuing pathos.) I kept hoping Walken would suddenly appear and, I dunno, garble out some non-sequitur from The Deer Hunter
 that'd spark anything, no matter how bizarre, that might ignite the surrealist vibe Click
 could've, should've had. No such luck. Written by Sandler's stable of former SNL
 scribes and directed by Waterboy
's Coraci, Click
, with its melodramatic "family first" message, evokes depressingly by-the-numbers emotionalism: It's a message movie whose real message isn't "Stop and Smell the Roses, Jackass," but "How to Manipulate the Audience in 12 E-Z Steps." (There's also an undercurrent of xenophobic crassness aimed at both Middle Eastern and Japanese cultures that's included for no apparent reason.) Director Frank Darabont learned the hard way about the perils of tinkering with Hollywood's classic morality plays in The Majestic
, which top-billed another manic comic � Jim Carrey � and ended up doing no one any favors. The same applies here. Sandler is a post-Catskills gold mine of potential, he always has been, and when he's willing to break with tradition (� la Punch-Drunk Love
), he's downright revelatory. Not this time, though. This time he's just dying.


"Click" may look like a comedy and sound like a comedy, but it's actually Adam Sandler's mid life crisis arriving just a wee bit ahead of schedule.
After a first half that's the epitome of Hollywood high-concept -- summer spun sugar in its most agreeable form -- this fantasy about a suburban schmo with a magic remote control tilts into darker and darker territory. By the end, the film's having a full-on panic attack: Imagine ``It's a Wonderful Life" with Happy Gilmore in place of George Bailey and you're almost there. Sandler may still be the most unapologetic vulgarian in the movies, but he's married with a kid now and suddenly he's thinking about the big picture. The result is a fully felt meditation on mortality -- with fart jokes.
If that sounds like an awkward balancing act, it is. ``Click" is sweet at heart, though, and it touches on areas of genuine unease for many men. And the premise is blissfully, farcically pure: What if you had a remote that actually controlled the universe?
Michael Newman (Sandler), a Manhattan architect living in the suburbs, finds out the hard way. Stretched to the breaking point between his duties as a husband to Donna (the ethereally beautiful Kate Beckinsale; did I mention this was a fantasy?), a father to little Ben (Joseph Castanon) and Samantha (Tatum McCann), and a groveling minion to boss Jack Ammer (David Hasselhoff, giving a grinning, ``Saturday Night Live"-level performance), Michael heads to the mall one night to replace his 50 remote controls with one. He's tired of pointing at the TV and opening the garage door.
He ends up in the ``Beyond" section of Bed Bath & Beyond (good joke, better product placement), where he encounters Morty, who looks like an untenured mad professor and is played by the great Christopher Walken with a perm and line readings just this side of Saturn. Morty's some sort of emissary from The Man -- maybe he is 
The Man -- and he gives Michael the sleek blue remote with a few warnings that go unheard: It programs itself after a while, and it can't be returned.
But who cares? Michael deliriously discovers he can fast-forward the family dog through its nightly poop, mute his wife's neurotic friend (Jennifer Coolidge), and skip foreplay altogether. (Here's the litmus test of whether you want to take kids to ``Click," by the way -- if they know what foreplay is or you don't mind explaining it to them, by all means go.)
The front half has all the gags you've seen in the trailers, and they're broad, crass, and inspired, from Michael's petty revenges against the obnoxious kid next door (Cameron Monaghan) to a sequence where Morty gives the hero a tour of the menu options to his life. There's a commentary track (I won't say who by, but you can probably guess) and a chapter search that scares the wits out of Michael by taking him back to the moment of his conception. (Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner play his parents; the thought of those two in flagrante is 
a little terrifying.)
``Click" is driven by more urgent concerns, though, ones that spring from Michael's despairing cry early on that ``every choice I make, everything I do, I disappoint somebody." He starts chapter-forwarding through parts of his life, leaping past family time to get to the pay off of job promotion, and soon the remote is doing the job on its own. Without giving too much away, I can say that we're in the back half of Michael's personal movie fairly quickly, which requires Sandler to don a fat suit and get gray while watching his children turn into grown-ups played by Jake Hoffman (Dustin's son) and Katie Cassidy (David's daughter; how about that?).
Despite a few vestigial groin kicks, this part of the movie is intensely serious, and you can feel Sandler struggling to make a mature statement while still holding on to his boo-ya fratboy core audience. Not for nothing is the film dedicated to the star's wife and child.
Does it work? You certainly want it to. ``Click" puts its finger -- jams its thumb, really -- on issues that have real emotional currency for men (and women) in middle America: how to allot time to the things that matter when the pie is getting sliced into smaller and smaller increments, how to multitask without losing your mind or your soul, how to be present as a parent. The most unsettling idea in the movie is that Michael might go on ``autopilot" for much of his life, because we've all known those fathers who simply weren't there
.
On the other hand: When a comedian gives himself a tear-sodden death scene, you know he's starting to wonder What It All Means. This way danger lies, as anyone who has followed Robin Williams's career knows. ``Click" gets its laughs and then sucker-punches us with sentiment; if it doesn't quite represent the new, improved Adam Sandler, it shows him almost desperately trying to figure out who that might be.


 Having conquered youngish love in "50 First Dates," Adam Sandler has turned his careless attention to family life with his new film, "Click." With any luck this may mean that, after next tackling middle age and retirement, this comic actor, who has made a career out of variations on the modern man-child, might soon be headed toward the great big cinematic beyond, thereby putting an end to his attempts to broach a subject profoundly unsuited to his talents: adulthood.  Mr. Sandler's talents are certainly modest, but the success of films like "The Waterboy" indicates that they are the sort of gifts that connect with moviegoers. In these and other audience favorites, Mr. Sandler plays emotionally and psychologically stunted men who, through happenstance and the help of a hot babe, end up lurching toward relative wisdom or at least success. Around the time of the release of "Big Daddy," he was quoted as saying: "I like idiot characters. It's fun to play that kind of guy: clueless people who frustrate other people." Mr. Sandler's big trick has been to turn those idiot characters into heroes who invariably have the last mean laugh. Think revenge of the nerd, but with a lower I.Q.  "Click" more or less follows the usual template: Mr. Sandler stars as Michael Newman, an up-and-coming architect with a pert, pretty wife, Donna (Kate Beckinsale), and two button-cute young children, Ben and Samantha, each of whom is played by three different actors, for reasons that will soon become clear. The story takes off after Michael, while searching for a universal remote control to simplify his chaotic life, wanders into a Bed, Bath and Beyond, where he meets a freaky salesclerk, Morty, with lightning bolts blazing off his head (who else? Christopher Walken). Morty of course understands that what today's harried white-collar family man needs is no ordinary remote, which is how Michael ends up with a device that allows him to hopscotch through time.  While some people might use a time-traveling device to, say, get the real scoop on weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Michael uses it to turn the volume down on his dog and his wife, the two being more or less interchangeable irritants, at least storywise. He also rewinds to high school and to several earlier cringe-worthy incidents involving his parents (Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner, each wearing some grotesque facial prosthetics). In a sop to the film's target audience, he also uses the remote to reduce the speed of a female jogger so he can watch the health-conscious blonde's generously proportioned breasts bounce slowly, slowly, up and down, an effect that would have been impossible if this ambulatory eye candy had been wearing the proper brassiere.  Breasts are big, so to speak, in "Click." When Michael fast-forwards to what turns out to be a fairly dark future — it's a wonderful life, not — he does a double take at the similarly bountiful profile of his now-adult daughter (Katie Cassidy) and orders her to put on a sweater, apparently as much for his sake as hers.  Michael arrives at this epiphanic moment after the story takes several abrupt turns into thornier terrain involving roads unwisely taken. Following the lead tendered by the credited screenwriters, Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe, the director Frank Coraci struggles to push the character toward the kind of age-appropriate complexity lost on Mr. Sandler, forgetting that his star only works when, as all those ponderous bosoms  suggest, he's un-weaned.    "Click" is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It's the kind of potty-mouthed movie that's one expletive shy of an R.

"Click" doesn't, alas. Adam Sandler's recent low-key phase continues with this cleverly conceived but conspicuously unfunny comedy about an overworked dad whose supernatural ability to remote-control his life turns out to be a mixed blessing. Though clearly calculated to appeal to the actor's adolescent male constituency, pic's preference for scatological sight gags over meaningful humor will leave some viewers groping (or at least hoping) for a remote control of their own. Still, the proven draw of a high-concept Sandler vehicle will help the Sony release get off to a healthy start at the summer box office.
Michael Newman (Sandler) is a successful architect whose long hours at work have led him to neglect his beautiful wife Donna (Kate Beckinsale) and two adorable kids, Ben and Samantha (Joseph Castanon and Tatum McCann). Frustrated one evening by the presence of so many remote controls in the house -- to the point where he can't turn on the TV without mistakenly opening the garage door -- Michael sets off to buy a universal remote, unaware that Fate is about to take his request quite literally.
While shopping at the local Bed, Bath and Beyond, Michael enters a secret room (labeled simply "Beyond") where he encounters a man with a mad-scientist fro and a suspiciously gentle demeanor. The fact that his name is Morty (and that he's played by Christopher Walken) should let auds know something is vaguely amiss, especially when he presents Michael with a stylish cobalt-blue remote control -- adding creepily, "because good guys need a break every once in a while."
It doesn't take Michael long to realize how powerful the device is; it enables him to freeze time, mute his dog's barking and fast-forward through arguments with Donna, simply by pointing and clicking. It also comes with an amusing DVD-style menu of options (impressively mounted by BlackBox) that allows him to revisit past moments in his life, with or without commentary.
Helmer Frank Coraci (who last directed Sandler in "The Waterboy") employs clever visual-aural strategies to illustrate the universal remote's powers as Michael becomes increasingly addicted. The screenplay, penned by producers Steve Koren and Mark O'Keefe, carefully lays the groundwork for Michael's undoing as he uses the remote to manipulate his way into a big promotion, while continually skipping the insignificant or unpleasant.
The problem, and it's a serious one, is that the pic's crude, anything-for-a-laugh stabs at humor are utterly irrelevant to the material. Following an all-too-familiar playbook, script trots out far too many random and tiresome jokes about dog-humping, penis size, farts in the face, kicks to the groin, and the unpronounceability of Arab names -- in short, everything you'd expect, if not necessarily want, from a Sandler comedy.
Ironically, Michael is one of thesp's more restrained roles, closer to the likeable average Joes of "Anger Management" and the undervalued "50 First Dates" than the idiot man-child persona he cultivated in "Happy Gilmore" and "Billy Madison." And Sandler -- who, as he demonstrated in "Punch-Drunk Love," can be a surprisingly graceful actor -- does get a rare opportunity here to emote, as pic shifts from would-be comedy to surprisingly trenchant family drama.
Soon the remote begins to operate on its own volition, using its stored memory about Michael's preferences to skip whole months, even years of his life without his permission. From here, "Click" takes a bold leap into the future, becoming a speculative cautionary tale in the tenor of "It's a Wonderful Life" or "A Christmas Carol."
As Michael sees his life systematically ruined by his long absences at home, Coraci jettisons the juvenile gags and wisely plays the material straight, extracting some unexpectedly resonant moments from the pic's obligatory life lessons about prioritizing family over work. Old-age makeup is credibly applied to several characters, and production designer Perry Andelin Blake and set decorator Gary Fettis have fun advancing a supremely tacky vision of the future.
With the exception of Henry Winkler and Julie Kavner, who manage to overcome the stereotypical Jewish shtick foisted upon them as Michael's parents, the supporting cast -- by any standard an embarrassment of comic riches -- is either misused or wasted.
Sean Astin's swim teacher gets a cheap laugh simply by showing up in a speedo, while the customarily brilliant Jennifer Coolidge has little to do as Donna's sniveling, man-hungry best friend. Rachel Dratch ("Saturday Night Live") ekes out roughly three scenes and even fewer laughs as Michael's awkward assistant, and David Hasselhoff is on point but hardly a riot as his ungrateful boss.

New Globalism ape-man, self-satisfied patron of slobbery, hot-tempered neo-Stoogethis is the Adam Sandler  we think we know, but in the last few years the sacred Sandler paradigm has undergone a New Man towel twisting. From Punch-Drunk Love  to Anger Management , 50 First Dates , and Spanglish , Sandlerism has been reconditioned as romantic bathos, auteurist and otherwise. (Next: Empty City , in which the Sandlerian schlub grieves for a family lost on 9-11.) But look againeven The Waterboy  evolves, shockingly quickly, into inspirational snifflers à la Hoosiers . The Budweiser and-cheese-filled-crust-pizza crowd, to whom Sandler delivers an assuring exaltation of couch hedonism and a ragtag soundtrack of better-off-forgotten '70s'80s chart climbers, may be a population of potbellied Shirley Temples after all.
Click  holds with the template in every detail, but in doing so attains a kind of terrifying grandeur. Eventually. First, we have to be satisfied with the busywork of the central gimmick: a supernatural remote given over to Sandler's Michael, a prototypical workaholic architect with no time for his two adorable urchins or blastin' corker of a wife (Kate Beckinsale , who inadvertently reaps the movie's first laugh with her mere presence in the kitchen, all hot-patootie boxers and luxuriant tinted mane and Victoria's Secret  legs, as "Mom"). After stumbling into the "Beyond" section of Bed Bath & Beyond (y'know, PG-13 audiences never knew  a time before product placements) and making buddies with a mysterious quack (a free-range Christopher Walken , dressed like Christopher Lloyd  in Back to the Future ), our sleepless, sick, frustrated semi-hero returns home with the dawning ability to pause arguments, fast-forward through boring dinners, rewind to early memories, la-di-da-di-da.
It's every half-brained oaf's daydream come true, and the movie knows itsoon enough, the desire to skip the irritating and elide the unpleasant takes over entirely, and Click  passes in its second half into Michael's hopscotched future, when age, weight, and narcissism are devastating wrecking balls. Thanks to the deranged priorities Sandler's harried fool shares with most Americans, and which Adam Sandler movies usually exemplifythoughtless ambition, headlong consumerism, convenience, careless entertainment, easy answershe acts out a modern, distinctly wrenching version of It's a Wonderful Life , where he spends most of time weeping for what he has missed (mostly as a parent) and reaches a kind of merciless point of no return by revisiting the final, regrettable meeting with his dead father (Henry Winkler ) and rewinding, over and over again, the "I love you" he missed the first time around.
De rigueur hypocritical as it may be coming from Hollywood , Click  is a cultural critique, with the dull blade and impact of a battle-ax. Whether the cojones on display belong to Sandler, screenwriters Steve Koren  and Mark O'Keefe , director Frank Coraci , or if a single pair can be accumulated among them all, one cannot guess. But it's a farce about loss, and it doesn't flinch.
