Before jumping to any hasty conclusions that the animated new film Happy Feet
 represents a cynical plundering for profit of the popular success of last year�s documentary March of the Penguins
, think again. In production for four years, work on Happy Feet
 was already under way at the time the 2005 documentary was also being filmed. Who knew that we would turn out to be a nation hooked on penguins? (The release of this new penguin picture will likely demonstrate the accuracy of this depiction of our love for these dramatic- yet comical-looking animals.) Also working in its favor is that it's directed by the Aussie filmmaker George Miller, the creative talent behind the universally delightful Babe
 movies (he scripted and produced the original and directed, produced, and scripted the follow-up). Happy Feet
 treads material common to kids films and cartoons, most notably Dumbo
: A young animal stands out from his herd or flock because of his inability to perform like the other animals, although he seemingly compensates for this defect by demonstrating a certain skill that sets him apart from the others, who ostracize him for his weirdness. Young Mumble the penguin (voiced by Wood) cannot find his heart song (which we're told here as in March of the Penguins
 is unique to each penguin and necessary to finding a mate). Horrible croaks emerge from his beak instead of tuneful melodies. Yet he spontaneously tap-dances like, well, like Savion Glover (whose acclaimed footwork was filmed through motion-capture techniques and grafted onto the penguin's body). His mom, Norma Jean (Kidman), and dad, Memphis (Jackman), like his dancing, as does Gloria (Murphy), the young female penguin who takes a shine to the unique penguin. However, Noah (Weaving), the leader of the tribe, banishes the adolescent Mumble from their midst, holding the penguin's peculiarities responsible for the recent fish shortage that's been driving the group toward starvation. The exiled Mumble embarks on a journey to discover the source of their interrupted food supply, and along the way he finds reinforcements in a Latin gang and the guru Lovelace (Williams, who also voices one of the gang members and narrates the story). Together they search for the "alien annihilators," the ones who bestowed Lovelace with his "talisman," a plastic six-pack container ring circling his neck. The film's ecological themes, while present throughout, come into the fore here but steer clear of the more complex questions such as whether humans should disobey their doctors and harvest and eat less fish. The constant singing and dancing throughout is charmingly presented, and the CGI re-creations of Antarctica are stunning, allowing the film to shift among glorious long shots of the ice and penguin population and midshots and close-ups of the character interactions. The chase sequences and the elephant seals might prove a bit scarier than what some of the younger viewers might be ready for, and the opening and closing sections of the film are a little bumpy getting in and out of the overall story. Still, you'll most probably find yourself raising your flippers in praise of Warner Bros. flightless fowl.


What do you get when you cross "March of the Penguins," Disney's
 "High School Musical," "The Ugly Duckling," a runaway jukebox, "Footloose," Joseph Campbell, "Riverdance," a Greenpeace board meeting, and five hits of prime, Woodstock-era brown acid? You get "Happy Feet," the new computer-animated family film that is quite simply the most bizarre thing under the Antarctic sun. Is it any good? I'm still figuring that out.
The posters and trailers are selling the movie as a feel-good comedy for the toddler set. It's not. While the youngest audiences will be charmed by the opening scenes of Emperor Penguins singing high-voltage renditions of baby boomer hits, and they'll coo with delight at the adorable li'l fuzzballs that subsequently hatch, "Happy Feet" takes a turn for the seriously intense after that. The penguins meet the enemy, and in the words of Pogo, he is us.
One of those fuzzballs is named Mumble (voiced by "Rugrats" regular E.G. Daily as a baby and by Elijah Wood as a barely molted adult). While his young peers are instructed that they each have to find their own personal "heartsong" -- all of which come straight from oldies radio -- Mumble can muster only a squawk. Instead, he's a born tap - dance artiste, the Savion Glover of the ice shelf (in fact, it's Glover's motion-captured feet and moves we're seeing), and when he gets his groove on, the other hatchlings thunderingly join in.
Unamused, the grown-up birds boot Mumble out of the pack. Journeying into exile, he joins up with a group of nattering Adelie penguins , led by one with the voice of Robin Williams. Inexplicably, these guys all talk with Hispanic accents, and Williams also plays a blustering, overweight Rockhopper penguin with a gospel croon. He's having fun and the kids will too, but this second-banana Speedy Gonzalez stuff feels moldy and embarrassing -- the Hollywood equivalent of racial profiling.
Besides, any reasonably sentient adult may already be in a coma from the film's full-throttle kitsch. The notion of CGI penguins performing a mating dance while singing a Las Vegas version of Prince's "Kiss" is not easy to get one's brain around. Mumble's father (Hugh Jackman) is an Elvis dude whose heartsong is "Heartbreak Hotel," his mama (Nicole Kidman) a Marilyn Monroe birdie down to the mole. When she leaves dad sitting on the egg, he whispers "Goodbye, Norma Jean," the penguin chorus kicks into "Never Can Say Goodbye," and your jaw hits the floor.
At the same time, you're registering that "Happy Feet" is one of the most visually ravishing CGI films yet rendered. The young penguins' first foray into the ocean is a remarkable underwater ballet, part Busby Berkeley , part Blue Angels; the animators ' use of light and color fits the end-of-the-world majesty of the setting. The movie's an uncategorizable mixture of the tacky and profound, and on some weird level, you have to respect it.
To its credit, too, "Happy Feet" understands that nature is red in beak and fang. There are attacks on Mumble and his pals by skua , seal, and killer whale, all of whom mean business; the seal especially is a slavering carnivore purged of all cuteness. Five- year- olds with delicate constitutions will cower under the seats while their hardier siblings will shriek with excitement and save the nightmares for later.
More to the point, "Happy Feet" sees the animals at the top of the food chain -- that's you and me -- as capable of the most long-term damage, and it sends its hero trudging across the tundra on a journey of mythic impact to right the matter. Even without the regular camera pullbacks to view the earth as a small cosmic marble, the movie's vantage point is planetary.
But it's a comedy, too, and often a funny one -- and a musical that spills over with demented exuberance. Who's responsible for this mash-up? George Miller, the Australian creator of the "Mad Max" movies, the writer and producer of "Babe," and (here's the relevant item) the director of the edgy, discomfiting "Babe: Pig in the City."
Like that film, "Happy Feet" dives into the darkness with overstuffed brio, and it delivers as much wonder as dissonance. Without giving too much away, there's a key sequence in a big city aquarium that's almost primordially powerful, not least because of the ghostly, preoccupied bipeds on the other side of the glass.
What can get these odd creatures to focus on the havoc they're wreaking? A tap-dancing penguin? A movie
 about a tap-dancing penguin? Or do we crave only momentary diversion before moving on? At its best and
 at its worst -- and after a while it's hard to tell the difference -- "Happy Feet" seems hellbent on diverting us into action.


         If there is such a thing as your standard penguin movie, "Happy Feet" isn't it. But with George Miller involved, how could it be?
 
  The Australian filmmaker, whose credits range from writing and producing "Babe" to writing and directing "Mad Max," doesn't make that many films, but those he does tend to be unusual. Which "Happy Feet" certainly is.
 


         






    A marvelous example of state-of-the art computer animation, "Happy Feet" is part family film, part Antarctic travelogue, part inspired musical (" 'March of the Penguins' meets 'Riverdance,' " to quote voice talent Robin Williams), and, most surprising of all, part ecological fable. The parts don't always fit together snugly, but most of them are absolutely dazzling.
 
  Though much current animation, from "Open Season" to "Over the Hedge," features talking animals, nothing even comes close to "Happy Feet's" strong environmental concerns. This is that rare animated feature that would be right at home on a double bill with "An Inconvenient Truth."
 
  Yet no one will come out of "Happy Feet" humming an Al Gore position paper. The film's musical and dancing numbers are little less than inspired, and they come out of a riff Miller and his co-writers John Collee, Judy Morris and Warren Coleman lifted right from nature.
 
  Each emperor penguin, apparently, has a distinctive squawk that enables the birds to distinguish each other in the largest crowds. The penguins in "Happy Feet," by extension, all have popular songs instead of squawks inside them, songs that represent who they are and serve as mating calls to attract members of the opposite sex.
 
  And what songs they are. To see penguins, by themselves and in groups, singing John Powell's engaging arrangements of, among many others, the Beatles' "Golden Slumbers," the Beach Boys' "In My Room," "Leader of the Pack" and "My Way" (in Spanish, no less), is even more of a treat than it sounds.
 
  This only works because the film's superior voice talent (Elijah Wood, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Brittany Murphy, Hugo Weaving and Williams in two roles) combine with advances in computer technology (the lead penguins have as many as 6 million feathers on them) to make these birds seem surprisingly realistic.
 
  Computer technology has also made the on-screen re-creation of the frigidly beautiful Antarctic region — where the birds go through stunts that would be the envy of X-Games participants — look as realistic as the 80,000 photographic images the film worked from can make it.
 
  The core plot idea of "Happy Feet" is that one particular penguin is born different. Nicknamed Mumble (voiced by Wood), he can't sing to save his life, but his feet are truly happy.
 
  To make Mumble's tap dancing on ice truly impressive, Miller used the same motion capture technology that created Golum in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy and combined it with the artistry of Savion Glover, today's master tapper. The results speak (or tap) for themselves.
 
  Though his mother, Norma Jean (Kidman), is supportive of her son's tapping, Mumble's father, Memphis (Jackman), is aghast. "It just ain't penguin," he laments. This is the position of tribal elder Noah (Weaving), who thinks Mumble's antics are the reason why the fish supply is dwindling, threatening the penguins' very existence.
 
  Though the fetching Gloria (Murphy) has eyes for the songless Mumble, he is cast out from the penguin tribe. Which means that he meets the irresistible voice of Williams (always a gift in animation) not once but twice: as Ramon, the leader of the Adelie Amigos, a group of five Latino penguins (don't ask), and as Lovelace, a penguin guru by way of Barry White.
 
  Mumble has the notion that what the penguins call "aliens," i.e. humans, are responsible for the declining fish supply, and he determines to do something about it.
 
  No film with as many elements as "Happy Feet" is successful with all of them, and the romantic-emotional elements of this story feel overly familiar. But the music and dancing are fresh and new, and this strong an ecological message has not been seen since Hayao Miyazaki's "Princess Mononoke." After everything from "March of the Penguins" to "Madagascar," you may think you've seen enough penguins, but you've never seen them like this.
 

 
  MPAA rating: PG for some mild peril and rude humor. Running time: 1 hour, 38 minutes. In general release.   

Why was Mumble the emperor penguin (Elijah Wood) born to tap-dance rather than sing like the rest of his ilk in Happy Feet , a moderately adorable, musically wacky, ecologically activist CG family comedy from George Miller, the guy who made Babe ? Because Mumble is, you know, different but special in a March of the Penguins  kind of way. Why was Robin Williams hired to voice two ethnic-accented fellow birds? Because once he kibitzed as a genie in Aladdin , and now, alas, he can’t be stuffed back into the freaking lamp.

 Correction Appended  The feet in the title of George Miller’s new film shuffle and stomp with glorious syncopation, but it would be a stretch to call them happy. Small and webbed and clawed, the appendages belong to an animated emperor penguin named Mumble (Elijah Wood) who, through the wizardry of computer animation, gets his terpsichorean moves from the brilliant tap-dancer Savion Glover. Like Mr. Glover and Eleanor Powell, Mumble was born to dance. There’s a song in his heart if not in his diaphragm, but, strangely, a lot of his tippity tappiting has the urgent pulse of an S O S.  Much like Mr. Miller’s excellent “Babe: Pig in the City” and his dystopian “Mad Max” trilogy, “Happy Feet” presents a vision of the world seen through a glass darkly. One of the most underrated  films of the 1990s, “Pig in the City” was a terrible commercial disappointment, an animal-farm noir that hewed closer in apocalyptic tone and feel to the “Mad Max” films than to its sunnier, much-beloved predecessor, “Babe.” “Happy Feet” is Mr. Miller’s first film in eight long years, and while compromised by the uplift and affirmation that mainstream animation regurgitates like a mommy penguin, it also shows a remarkable persistence of vision. Even in a story about singing-and-dancing fat and feather, Mr. Miller can’t help but go dark and deep.  It takes him a while to get there. First, he must unleash Robin Williams, who gives wacky, at times uneasy voice to several characters, including that of a charming Adélie penguin named Ramon,  who sounds more East Los Angeles than Anywhere Antarctica. Having been shunned by the other emperor penguins because he can’t sing, Mumble joins a flock of smaller, stubbier Adélie penguins who,  when not collecting pebbles, do stand-up. Mr. Williams, who these days is better heard than seen, also pours on the molasses as an Rockhopper penguin called Lovelace, who sounds a lot like the singer Barry White, which means he’s one of the few so-called black voices in a world that sounds otherwise white as deep winter.  That doesn’t mean that Mr. Williams isn’t funny, only that it’s discomfiting that so many children’s films depend on voices that are funny only because they exploit ethnic and racial stereotypes. Because penguins look pretty much alike, most of the principals deliver distinctive vocal performances. Nicole Kidman recycles her baby-breathy Marilyn Monroe shtick for Mumble’s mother, Norma Jean, while Hugo Weaving sticks a Scottish burr in his throat to play an elder penguin named Noah. For Mumble’s father, Memphis, Hugh Jackman throws his voice into the deep-fryer and comes up with something that’s a little bit country, a little bit rock ’n’ roll. Everyone sounds pretty white except when they’re lip-synching (beak-synching?) the funk and R&B standards on the film’s playlist.  “Happy Feet” is far from the only animated film to lean on stereotype for its comedy: “Over the Hedge” and “Cars” do the same, among many other animated features, as does, of course, “Borat.”  I bring this up only because Mr. Miller brings an unusual depth of feeling to his work as well as a distinct moral worldview. “Happy Feet” is a familiar story about a wee outsider forced to struggle against the usual odds and misguided adults to discover his inner penguin. Yet tucked inside this nominally feel-good jukebox musical with its crooning and swooning critters is a piercingly sad story about the devastation being visited on the natural world. The tapping we hear, as it turns out, is drilling holes in our hearts.  For the most part, the screenplay — written by Mr. Miller, Warren Coleman, John Collee and Judy Morris — traces a familiar arc. Not long after he happens upon the flock of Adélie penguins, Mumble discovers that alien creatures (guess who?) are scooping all the fish out of the ocean. Determined to right this wrong, he and three others set off on a voyage that includes sweeping images of mountains that recall Mr. Wood’s high-altitude trekking in “The Lord of the Rings” and brings the travelers face to face with elephant seals with astonishing photorealistic tusklike protuberances. What makes the seals especially beautiful isn’t the almost tactile detail of their crinkles and grooves; it’s that, unlike Mumble and his vaguely anthropomorphized face, they look insistently and gloriously like animals.  Beauty announces itself quietly in “Happy Feet,” whether in the discreetly shifting shades of white that seem to turn the snow into a living, breathing organism, or in the articulated lines of penguin chicks that make each ball of downy fluff a very specific ball of downy fluff. All this beauty makes it easy to understand why Mumble might want to tap his feet with joy. It also explains why Mr. Miller, after doing an extremely credible approximation of the wonderful world of Walt Disney, plunges his hapless hero into a nightmare worthy of Samuel Fuller’s “Shock Corridor.” As politically pointed as it is disturbing, it is a view of hell as seen through the eyes and ears of creatures we foolishly, tragically call dumb.  “Happy Feet” is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). There are a few scenes of peril that might frighten young children, but it’s the adults who will probably need the hankies.

Viewers weary of the increasing similarity of most animated films have a tonic at hand in "Happy Feet." Likely to be affectionately dubbed "March of the Penguins: The Musical," George Miller's long-in-the-works dive into full-blown computer animation drapes a relatively conventional story, about a young penguin's struggles over being "different," in striking visuals, invigorating songs and lively characterizations. Although the film might prove a bit too different for a minority of parents, general reaction is likely figures to be one of jaw-dropping amazement, sparking merry B.O. through the holidays and further abundance in home entertainment incarnations. Extensive simultaneous Imax engagements will be particularly popular.
There is no mistaking "Happy Feet" as anything but the work of a real filmmaker; in terms of composition, camera movement and editing, the pic is conceived as a "real" movie, and emerges as one of the very best directed animated films on record. Not surprisingly from the force behind the "Babe" movies, the attention to detail is phenomenal, the humor ample.
But the story is inescapably serious on both personal and societal levels. While countless moppet-targeted films have taught the lesson that the oddball shall prevail and that everyone is gifted in a particular way, looming over everything here is the specter of aliens -- human beings, that is -- who leave ominous traces of their comings and goings on the icy wastes of Antarctica and impinge upon the penguins' supply of fish. The environmental themes are familiar, but Miller superbly manifests the threat in a manner both tactile and hauntingly poetic.
Fine while up and flying, pic has trouble with both takeoff and landing. Intro of emperor penguin society consists of a virtual assault of mostly soulful R&B tunes. Initial seg, in fact, reps a recapitulation of "March of the Penguins," as the moms lay eggs, hand them off to the dads and head off for distant feeding waters while the males face the bitter, months-long night of incubation.
Conformity reigns as this community's highest value, with strict compliance enforced by wizened elders, wonderfully craggy figures who look like they were chiseled by Rodin. It's expected emperor penguins will have beautiful voices. Newborn tyke Mumble can't put two notes together, but the little bugger sure can dance; he's born tapping, with speed and moves the equal of tapmaster Savion Glover, who provided the motion-capture terpsing for the furry bird.
Mumble's mom (voiced by Nicole Kidman) doesn't mind her son's eccentricity, but his dad (Hugh Jackman) complains that "it just ain't penguin." Despite the great song-and-dance potential exhibited by Mumble (voiced after infancy by Elijah Wood) and his dazzlingly voiced pal Gloria (Brittany Murphy), Mumble is eventually exiled by the high priest (Hugo Weaving).
And so begin Mumble's wanderings, riddled with unknown dangers. In the first and most child-frightening of three big-action set pieces, each more dazzling than the last, Mumble is attacked by an unusually toothsome seal, only to be taken under the wing of a bunch of small, Mexican-accented penguins fronted by Ramon (Robin Williams).
Mumble is embraced as "Big Guy," and begins to see there's more to the world than the rigid realm of Emperor Land. In another fantastic action scene, Mumble and his five buddies go careening like so many live toboggans down a vast run of slopes and bowls and cliffs at breathtaking speed until they are caught up short by the sight of an alien visitation.
The band of wayfarers enlarges again with the addition of rockhopper penguin Lovelace (Williams again, in soulful mode), a self-styled guru. The odyssey briefly reunites Mumble, who retains his immature gray feathers throughout, with Gloria and his emperor brethren. But with food in diminished supply, Mumble sets out for the Forbidden Shore, where elephant seals (including one voiced by the late Steve Irwin) warn him he'll encounter the dreaded annihilator aliens. He also crosses paths with two killer whales in a scene of eye-popping choreographed action.
Mumble's close encounter with Earth's dominators and the detritus of their activities, powerfully imagined from the bird's point of view, proves thoroughly sobering; following logically, pic would end on a quite dire note. Given this impossibility, Miller and fellow screenwriters John Collee, Judy Morris and Warren Coleman contrive a way to deliver a relatively upbeat ending, one that doesn't completely dismiss the peril but still seems concocted.
While having been nimbly edited for momentum and flow, "Happy Feet" employs long takes and the moving "camera" considerably more than do most animated films. Result is a film of heightened elegance and precision as well as a strong sense of space; the widescreen frame can barely contain the vast landscapes, as well as a bulging cast of happy-footed "extras" that would have turned Busby Berkeley green with envy. Pic reps the most ambitious and successful use of the motion-capture technique to date.
Musical elements, overseen by composer John Powell, are extraordinarily diverse in style. At times, the familiarity of song selections proves tiresome and overbearing. At others, however, freshness of the covers and novelty of the contexts are genuinely funny, among them a Spanish-lingo version of "My Way," an ironic rendering of "Leader of the Pack" and some Beach Boys-backed surfing unlike anyone in Malibu has ever done.
A Babel's brew of accents comprise the spirited voicings, with Williams doing fine double-duty in focused funny mode. End credits, which contain more than 1,000 names, may be the longest on record.

If anything could tempt an adult to go see a dancing-penguin movie, it's the phrase "from the guy who brought you Babe ." That movie got everything right about talking animals, but alas, George Miller  does not live up to his earlier work here. Happy Feet  starts out well enough on an iceberg, where penguins sing until they find another penguin whose tune matches theirs. (It's clear that the filmmakers, along with the rest of the world, saw March of the Penguins .) Memphis (voiced by Hugh Jackman ) and Norma Jean  (Nicole Kidman ) link up over a Prince duet and have a chick named Mumbles (Elijah Woods ). Chick can't sing, but he's born with the gift of tap, thus everything's on track for a cute story about being yourself. But then there's Robin Williams . Children, innocent as they are, may not yet have grown to loathe the actor's shtick, but you might like to know that he has twoyes, tworoles in this film. And even the wee ones may start to notice something's amiss when the movie's theme goes from "be yourself" to "we must regulate the overfishing of the Antarctic oceans." No, for real.
