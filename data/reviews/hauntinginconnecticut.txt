The Haunting in Connecticut
 opens with a title stating that what follows is "based on a true story," which is all well and good and practically a mandate for this type of haunted-house film. But what galls me � and what will have other genre fans gnashing their teeth down to the sublingual tissue � is that Cornwell's film, stylistically at least, is really "based" on snips and snatches of Lucio Fulci's The Beyond
, Mario Bava's Shock
, Alejandro Amen�bar's The Others
, and, of course, The Amityville Horror
. The film is based much more on these film forerunners than it is based on any supernatural events alleged to have occurred in the real world. Technically, the film is adapted, loosely, from splatterpunk author Ray Garton's book In a Dark Place: The Story of a True Haunting
, but The Haunting in Connecticut
 has the patchwork feel of a director at odds with himself. Cornwell, who shot the immensely popular stop-motion short �Ward 13,� doesn't get a lot of help from his screenwriters, Adam Simon (Carnosaur
, Brain Dead
) and Tim Metcalfe (Revenge of the Nerds
, Kalifornia
). Their stilted dialogue and endless stream of expository yakking seem better suited to one of the post-dubbed Euro-shockers mentioned above. As for the story, true or not, Madsen and Donovan are ill-cast as Sara and Peter Campbell, a fiercely boring upper-middle-class couple who nevertheless make the potentially exciting decision to move their family into a house that formerly served as both a mortuary and nexus of eternal evil. (They don't know that going in, but still.) The move is predicated on situating the family closer to a hospital where son Matt (Gallner) is being treated with chemotherapy and experimental drugs for an unspecified, rapidly metastasizing cancer. Living as he is in the borderland between life and death, Matt is able to see visions of the house's tortured past, though it's not long before the entire Campbell clan is surrounded by haints and horrors. Who you gonna call? Elias Koteas! (Duh.) The veteran character actor (The Thin Red Line
, Zodiac
) appears here as a priest who, like the increasingly horrified Matt, is also suffering from a dearth of decent dialogue and a surplus of cancer. Koteas' overearnest performance almost makes The Haunting in Connecticut
 worth a look, but ultimately even the star of Cronenberg's Crash
 can't salvage what is essentially a substandard rip-off of The Amityville Horror
.

It's every parent's worst nightmare  - a child with cancer  - a story that's grist for lousy horror moviemaking. "The Haunting in Connecticut" is another movie based on a supposedly true paranormal occurrence  - perhaps you haven't entirely forgotten 2005's "The Exorcism of Emily Rose" or "An American Haunting" from 2006.
This time, the object of evil is a teenager named Matt Campbell (Kyle Gallner). His parents, played by Virginia Madsen and Martin Donovan, have rented a manse close to the hospital where Matt receives his free experimental cancer treatments, and moved with their two younger kids and a teenage niece pert enough for an absurd last-minute shower sequence. The house, as it happens, was once a mortuary, which allows you to do the math on the undeadness afoot.
There is still a great horror movie about foreclosure to be made. In the meantime, this movie plays games. (How many rounds of hide-and-seek should an audience tolerate?)
"The Haunting in Connecticut" adds family melodrama to its horror clichés. According to Mom, Dad used to be a "liar and a drunk," and staying truthful and sober proves a challenge. He shows up one night in a functional drunken rage. He unscrews and destroys all the light bulbs himself, robbing some crew member of a perfectly good union job. Dad doesn't just fall off the wagon. He parachutes. Madsen is as elegant as ever.
There's no trace of her rougher, rawer "Candyman" days, even through, as a silly horror thrillers go, that movie had lot more to recommend.
The possibility exists that the director Peter Cornwell and the credited screenwriters Adam Simon and Tim Metcalfe did research on the actual case, which transpired in the mid-1980s (and remains dubious in the opinion of some). It seems more plausible that they just binged on every nominal scary movie made in the last 10 years. Their film uses all the same tricks  - blurry images in mirrors and windows, deafening sound design, erratic editing that could face charges for assault and battery. An ax head flies through a door as one famously did in "The Shining."
Eventually, Elias Koteas arrives as a holy man in a spiffy hat, and the filmmakers try to frame him with as much iconic authority as Max von Sydow in "The Exorcist." Nice try. This isn't moviemaking. It's charades.

In the grand tradition of horror movies relvolving around scary houses, the suburban home occupied by Sara Campbell (Madsen) and her cancer-stricken son (Veronica Mars ' Gallner) looks perfectly charming by day. But at night, its nooks become shadows from which a secret emerges: The building was once a mortuary, and its former occupants haven't all left yet. Madsen barely emotes during the ensuing flood of hokey scare tactics, but The Haunting in Connecticut  is smart enough to put much of its weight on Gallner, a lively presence with a terrifically sour mug that makes him look like a mutual cousin of Willem Dafoe and Peter Lorre.

 Spinning another based-on-actual-events tale of a family ejected  from its  home by angry spirits, “The Haunting in Connecticut” gives you the creeps, the giggles and the groans in almost equal measure.  When the Campbells (headed by Virginia Madsen and Martin Donovan) discover that their rickety Connecticut rental is a former funeral parlor, it’s left to the family’s terminally ill son (Kyle Gallner, earnestly moping) to handle the disgruntled former clients. Apparently their mortician liked to do more than just embalm.  Aside from the presence of the usual corny cleric (here played on the level by Elias Koteas), the movie  refers to “Psycho,” “The Shining” and “The Exorcist” by way of Amityville. But these mnemonics are far less distracting than the endlessly prompting, screeching score. Stories like this need hush to work: the rustle of a shroud and the dry whisper of ghostly conversation can’t compete with shrieking violins.  Directing his first feature, Peter Cornwell delivers some genuinely grisly imagery: a rusty tin filled with eyelid trimmings — their lashes still attached — and a spew of brocadelike ectoplasm. Most unsettling of all are the peaceful photographs of dead people that link the movie’s parallel worlds; as the Icelandic filmmaker Hrabba Gunnarsdottir proved in her mesmerizing documentary “Corpus Camera,” images of the deceased can provide a great deal more than closure.  “The Haunting in Connecticut” is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). Food turns into water, water turns into blood and corpses turn into insulation.

At a time when so much has been reported about financially strapped folks facing foreclosure, there may be a receptive market for a pic that warns against moving too quickly into a house that only looks like a great bargain. But ticketbuyers will get far too few scares for their money with "The Haunting in Connecticut," a based-on-fact ghost story that's long on atmosphere yet short on dramatic tension. Set for a March 27 theatrical rollout, this Lionsgate release likely will fade fast from megaplexes prior to its quick reincarnation as homevid product.
Working from a script by Adam Simon and Tim Metcalfe, helmer Peter Cornwell sets up the story with brisk efficiency and a reasonable degree of logic.
Anxious mom Sara Campbell (Virginia Madsen), eager to be closer to the clinic where sickly teen son Matt (Kyle Gallner) is receiving cancer treatment, talks her husband Peter (Martin Donovan) into renting a long-deserted Victorian house in upstate Connecticut. Peter remains tied up with his job, but Sara moves into the place with Matt, her two younger children (Sophi Knight, Ty Wood) and niece Wendy (Amanda Crew).
Unfortunately, as even the rental agent admits, the house has "a bit of a history." Specifically, the Connecticut manse (played, quite convincingly, by a house in Teulon, Manitoba) used to be a funeral home where corpses were defiled and seances were conducted on a routine basis. Sara and her family learn about this only gradually, and not before Matt is beset by visions of a charred youngster whose long-ago involvement with the seances was, apparently, involuntary.
Floorboards creak ominously, wraiths appear fleetingly and, in one especially memorable scene, a bloody mop flops loudly. Still, nothing here rises above the level of routine haunted-house bumping-in-the-night. The overall structure is haphazard, with defining characteristics -- such as Peter's barely controlled alcoholism -- abruptly introduced for immediate dramatic effect, then more or less forgotten about. And while a few lines really are intentionally
 funny ("Now we know why the rent was so cheap!"), too many scenes trigger snickers of the derisive sort.
Perfs are serviceably sincere across the board, with Elias Koteas (cast as a clergyman who tries to help the Campbell clan) a standout for his intense underplaying. Special effects are first-rate, but scenes in which ectoplasms spurt from the mouths of supporting players probably will produce more giggles than gasps.


There's no rest for the dead—or the living—in this laughably hokey haunted-house hand-wringer based on yet another Amityville  -style "true story" peddled by an enterprising family eager to turn a bum real estate deal into a pop-culture gold mine. The trouble begins when the Campbell clan—mom (Virginia Madsen , battling her own terrifying, post-Oscar-nom curse), dad (erstwhile Hal Hartley  muse Martin Donovan ), and cancer-stricken teenage son (paler-than-thou Robert Pattinson  doppelgänger Kyle Gallner )—moves into one of those rickety fixer-uppers with "a bit of history" that looks like it hasn't been redecorated since the last Depression, only to discover (spoiler alert!) that it's a former funeral home, where, once upon a time, something very, very bad happened. From there, you can set your watch by the phantom apparitions, shock-edited sepia flashbacks, and eruptions of projectile ectoplasm, until a mysterious man of the cloth (Elias Koteas , sporting the House of Father Merrin's spring line) shows up to invoke the power of the Almighty. In the realm of domestic horror, The Haunting in Connecticut  is about as scary as a shower that suddenly changes temperature when someone flushes the toilet, but its stolid, unironic flat-footedness may prove an asset in a box-office climate where everything '80s (Friday the 13th , My Bloody Valentine  , Paul Blart : Mall Cop  a/k/a Police Academy 10 ) is new again.
