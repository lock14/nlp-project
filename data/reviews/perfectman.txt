If you love Hilary Duff � her smoky eye make-up, her heavily texturized and casually perfect updos, her low-slung cargos, her youthful Texan pluck � then by all means run right out to this movie, a virtual long-form episode of Lizzie McGuire
 (minus the irritating animation), directed by a veteran of the series. Be enchanted by her cute bedroom (somehow affordable for a single mother in Brooklyn) and her iBook (ditto) and her miniature claw clips and the dorky but cool cartoonist guy with a crush on her (Feldman). Marvel as she makes a sassy best friend (Lengies) before fully ascending the front steps at her new high school! Watch her explicate the story through the miracle of instant messaging! Less a feature film than 90 minutes of tweenage feminine wish fulfillment, The Perfect Man
 is like Teen People
 come to life. It�s perfectly PG, and it�s probably not the worst thing a young lady could see, depending on your criteria. Cinematically, it�s like watching your lawn grow. It will bore the living shit out of anyone not raptly attuned to Duff�s slightest movement. (Look! Her dimple appeared!) And it will insult you. Oh yes. It will insult you with a smarty-farty little sister (Wallace) who�s going to walk away with this year�s Jonathan Lipnicki Award for Wheedling Cuteness. It will insult you by suggesting that a hot New York restaurateur can sit down during Saturday�s dinner rush to counsel his teenage niece about love. It will insult you with scriptwriter platitudes: "You don�t let anybody close enough to hurt you" and "Every day has the potential for beauty!" It�s not truly a howler, like scribe Gina Wendkos� timeless classic Coyote Ugly
, but it does have kind of a weird cult aspect to it if you know where to look. So look for Dennis DeYoung in a truly humiliating cameo as the frontman of a Styx cover band! Look for Queer Eye
 guy Carson Kressley as � wait for it � a really flaming homosexual who gets a lot of laughs! (Kressley is, of course, the only thing remotely fun about the film.) The trouble is that while it�s professing mad love for single mothers (in the form of Locklear), the film is concomitantly trashing them. In what parallel universe do parents � let alone hot blond MILFs, left alone in the embattled New York City public school system � interrupt a PTA meeting to whine, "I need to meet a good man"? The movie wrings jokes out of poor Locklear, who�s so game and professional despite having very little comic timing, by setting her up for a romance with a Styx-loving meathead (O�Malley) and having her fret about her wrinkles. Of course everything turns out okay, and Duff reassures her that she�s beautiful to her children and can stand on her own, but while the audience should be high-fiving and go-girling and doing everything the producers want us to do, we�re left with the message that hooking up with any dumb old schlub is an improvement over single motherhood. The movie insists on this idea so strenuously as its ostensibly comic premise that it can�t take it back.


''The Perfect Man" is the new Hilary Duff movie, and like most of her contributions to cinema, it is to be endured rather than enjoyed. She plays Holly, the upbeat teenage daughter of Jean (Heather Locklear), a genius pastry chef who packs up her two girls and leaves town whenever a man breaks her heart. The gang winds up in Brooklyn, where Holly decides she's tired of moving and is convinced that the best way to keep her mother anchored is to concoct a man who treats her right.
Following the advice of a friend's restaurateur uncle, Ben (Chris Noth), Holly leaves her mother an orchid and writes her a love letter from this fictitious perfect man. As it happens, he is also named Ben and he says and does all the things a lovelorn and terribly gullible person might want to hear.
The ruse reaches its uncomfortable climax when the daughter, pretending to be Ben, engages her mother in a round of instant messaging. The movie's PG rating ensures that that sequence doesn't become the perverse treat it could have been. As a compromise, we do learn that Jean's dream is to ''make people fall in love with baking again."
Mom is swept off her feet, and the movie's foolish fantasy comes awfully close to seeming nuts. When Jean's friend (Caroline Rhea) has a bridal shower at Ben's restaurant, Holly nearly sabotages his joint to keep her mother from seeing him (Holly misguidedly sent a photo of the real Ben with a letter). Eventually, the daughter has to break up with her mother because the scheme is a lot of work. It's all too cruel. But predictably, it ends well.
Holly and Jean's relationship might have made for a nifty melodrama or psychological thriller. See how the mother's selfishness and low self-esteem has made a little narcissist of the daughter. Observe how the daughter, so much like her mother but so unaware, lashes out. But ''The Perfect Man" is not ''Mildred Pierce," ''Terms of Endearment," or even ''Anywhere But Here." It's a dopey little Disney Family Channel movie, if not in name then in spirit.
Still, what ''The Perfect Man" offers is preferable to any drama starring Duff and Locklear. Neither woman has a talent I can name -- unless, in Locklear's case, longevity can be considered a skill. (Her face looks magically flawless.) All the same, each woman is bearable in her own way.
I did enjoy Ben Feldman, the actor playing the sweet, budding comic-book artist with the raging crush on Holly. The character's feelings for this self-absorbed girl are hard to understand, but Feldman encourages us to believe in them anyway.
Otherwise, there is a cartoonish Noo Yawk accent or two, and there's an idiotic, Styx-obsessed suitor (Mike O'Malley) from the bakery where Jean works. There's also a cheesy family dance-along to a terrible techno song that inspires the ladies to collapse on the sofa convulsing with giggles. (Uncle Ben promises the music will make any woman happy. I'm not a woman, and it nauseated me.)
At 17, Duff still doesn't seem comfortable in her skin. But this movie reveals a dark side that is much more appealing than her spunky one. To see what she's really capable of, I'm rooting for ''The Perfect Man -- Episode III," where she finally puts on a big black helmet and wheezes her little heart out.



         In "The Perfect Man," the moon exists "to remind us that each day has the potential for beauty." This according to Jean (Heather Locklear), a fancy-cake baker and single mother of two who would be better off remembering that each day has the potential for medication. Jean is a serial monogamist with a penchant for losers. Every time one dumps her, she picks up the family and moves. Spastic parenting calls for drastic measures, so when newly installed in Brooklyn (where everyone sounds exactly like Fran Drescher), Jean's daughter Holly (Hilary Duff) smells another bad egg in the person of Lenny the Styx-loving baker (Mike O'Malley) and decides to play e-Cyrano. Inventing a perfect man for Jean to fall for sight unseen, she models him on her friend's uncle, Ben (Chris Noth), the kind of sexy, warm restaurant owner who always has time for inquisitive 10th graders during the lunch rush. Holly gets so caught up writing Jean love e-mails in an effort to prevent her from marrying Lenny that she overlooks her own perfect boy, Adam (Ben Feldman), a cute artist who lets Holly commandeer his computer for her e-charade. Then she spends each wistful night confiding it all to her online diary. Sure, it all sounds like a stretch, but Jean is just crazy enough for it to work — the plan, that is, not the movie. The movie is a tortured marshmallow. It's too disingenuous for teens (at least the teens sitting behind me at the screening, who kept howling, "Where's the moooon?") and too mommy's-going-on-Match.com-again disturbing for younger viewers. Seriously, the perfect man would call social services.
 
 "The Perfect Man": 
PG for some mildly suggestive content. It suggests that mom gets around. 1 hour, 40 minutes. In general release.

What sin did Heather Locklear commit to deserve her role in The Perfect Man ? The former Melrose Place  vixen is now old enough to portray Hilary Duff's mom, which in Hollywood counts as sin enough. In The Perfect Man , she's a single mother so desperate for male company that she thinks she deserves no better than the loser who drives a Trans-Am and woos her with his late-night-on-the-sidewalk performance of Styx's ''Lady.'' To remedy her mom's dating woes, Duff, who grows perkier the worse her movies get, invents a fictional secret admirer who ''pursues'' Locklear with flowers and cloying e-mail notes. This is the story, in other words, of a woman being wooed by a nonentity; it's You've Got Mail  with one hand typing. Duff's character has problems too (she's tired of moving from city to city), but no actress this synthetically wholesome should engage in this much whining. It renders her about as appealing as a lost Olsen triplet.

 The flimsy new Hilary Duff comedy "The Perfect Man" has a moral of sorts. Ms. Duff's character, Holly Hamilton, is so distracted in the classroom by her own silly schemes that  she is oblivious to the quotation from Sir Walter Scott that her English teacher scrawls across the blackboard: "Oh what a tangled web we weave,/ when first we practice to deceive."  Holly's deception is at least well meaning. It involves inventing and sending e-mail messages from a nonexistent secret admirer to cheer up her glum, husband-hungry single mom, Jean (Heather Locklear). A baker who specializes in garish multitiered cakes, with clashing colors that evoke electric rainbows of toxic dye, Jean is so desperate to remarry that she has fallen into a pattern of bonding with the first remotely eligible man to cross her path.  Each time an instant relationship fizzles, Jean grieves to Patsy Cline records, then moves to a new city with her two daughters, Holly and her younger sister, Zoe (Aria Wallace), a 6-year-old bespectacled spelling bee fanatic. In the movie's opening scenes, Jean's flight from her latest louse lands the three of them in Brooklyn.  Ms. Duff, who is pushing 18, has arrived at the awkward age when she is too old to be a tweener role model trying on a bra and too clean-cut to be a mean girl, although her 2004 film "A Cinderella Story" found her menaced from all sides by her sadistic, snooty peers. She has invested so much of her star capital in being good that she is boxed in by her own wholesomeness. That's unfortunate, because Ms. Duff, who has an abrasive edge to match her coarse, medium-good looks, never seemed especially wholesome. Angelic she's not.  "The Perfect Man" toys with the notion of mother-daughter role reversal, in which Holly teaches Mom the courage not to keep running away. Ms. Locklear's Jean is blandness personified. The actress resembles a pool of runny vanilla yogurt with a pallid seam of strawberry: blond hair, creamy complexion and features so perfect and perfectly nondescript that they blend into nothingness. The range of Ms. Locklear's lobotomized acting runs from mild irritation to mild melancholy, expressed without expression.  The man who supplies the ideas and the name of Jean's invented secret admirer, Ben Cooper (Chris Noth), is the handsome bachelor uncle of Holly's best friend, Amy (Vanessa Lengies), and the owner of a bistro. As Ben's fluttery right-hand man, Carson Kressley from "Queer Eye for the Straight Guy" makes his movie debut, playing a kind of gay Stepin Fetchit, a creature so dizzy that he assumes a group of construction workers must be stragglers from a Village People convention.  The wittiest character, though,  isn't Mr. Kressley's worn-out stereotype but Jean's co-worker Lenny Horton (Mike O'Malley), a weepy lug obsessed with the band Styx who falls head over heels for his vanilla yogurt dream girl the moment he lays on eyes on her. Even after he screeches "Lady" under her window, Jean is so desperate for a husband that she refuses to rule him out as a possibility. You can't get more desperate than that.  "The Perfect Man" is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It has mild innuendo.

Theatrical play seems a mere formality for "The Perfect Man," a wan romantic comedy destined for heavy rotation on family-skewing cable networks. Hilary Duff's name-above-title presence may attract teen girls (and the boys who date them) in sufficient numbers for modest opening-weekend coin. But quick fall-off should accelerate fast-forward to homevid and other ancillaries.
Working from story credited to Michael McQuown, Heather Robinson and Katherine Torpey, scripter Gina Wendkos has cobbled together by-the-numbers scenario that occasionally recalls 1999 releases "Anywhere But Here" and "Tumbleweeds." Much like those two far more substantial pics, "Perfect Man" pivots on the relationship between footloose mother and increasingly disapproving daughter. In this case, however, situation is mined mostly for mild chuckles and tepid sentiment.
Single mom Jean Hamilton (Heather Locklear) overreacts whenever she realizes that her boyfriend is the latest in a long line of losers. Indeed, every time her heart is broken, she packs up her kids -- 16-year-old Holly (Duff) and 7-year-old Zoe (Aria Wallace) -- and moves to a different city. Latest migration takes family to Brooklyn, where Jean -- who spends more time baking confections than any screen character since Mildred Pierce -- lands work at bakery run by an old buddy (Kym Whitley).
After being uprooted so many times, Holly is reluctant to begin new relationships, and her view of Mom as a monomaniaclly selfish woman would seem to hold more than a little truth. But Holly finds a new friend in Amy (Vanessa Lengies), a spunky Brooklynite, and even recognizes romantic potential in Adam (Ben Feldman), another classmate. So she's deeply concerned when Jean appears poised to repeat the same old mistakes by hooking up with Lenny (Mike O'Malley), a fellow bakery employee who's entirely too fond of '80s hair bands and muscle cars.
To distract her mother from an obvious Mr. Wrong, Holly invents a "secret admirer" to woo Jean with flowers, love letters, e-mails and other tokens of esteem. Since this is a family-skewing comedy and not an episode of "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit," Jean assumes her unseen beau is a sweetie, not a stalker.
Trouble is, Holly is hard-pressed to sustain the hoax and soon turns to using unwitting input from Amy's uncle, hunky restauranteur Ben Cooper (Chris Noth). Holly borrows character traits, life lessons and even a first name from Ben to make her imaginary gentleman caller all the more believable.
One thing leads to another -- though not very quickly, alas -- as helmer Mark Rosman plods toward a series of happy endings to reward almost every character on screen. (Poor Lenny gets the fuzzy end of the lollipop, which may upset auds amused by O'Malley's surprisingly engaging performance.) Pic feels padded by a good 10 or 15 minutes, and the slow pace gives aud far too much time to question what's said and done (and left unsaid) by characters.
Locklear does her best to tone down her glam quotient. And Noth is appealing in a thinly written role. But pic is Duff's world, and everybody else is just a satellite. Young actress is well cast and more than competent, easily handling the slangy narration.
For most part, "The Perfect Man" is too bland to merit anything more censorious than a stifled yawn. Even so, Carson Cressley's broad portrayal of a mincing gay bartender at Ben's restaurant may offend those who make a point of being offended by such things. Unusually drab lensing by John R. Leonetti may look slightly better on TV screens. Toronto locations adequately sub for Brooklyn.

The Perfect Man   Directed by Mark Rosman   Universal, opens June 17
All of Hilary Duff 's previous starring vehicles have existed solely to promote her burgeoning musical career. The Lizzie McGuire  Movie and Raise Your Voice were less about recreation than validation; theoretically, in today's American Idol  culture, if you can convincingly act like a pop star, then you are a pop star. Duff's previously dogged refusal to focus on acting instead of pimping her latest single makes The Perfect Man perplexing. Duff plays her standard characteran introverted romantic who falls for a guy whose hunky exterior belies an artistic soulbut she never gets her equally standard moment of revelation, where the mousy caterpillar becomes the pretty, full-throated butterfly. The result is like a Nike  commercial without a shot of the sneakers. In the space normally reserved for soundtrack plugs director Mark Rosman  inserts lots and lots of tears: Duff and Heather Locklear , who plays a single mom so desperate to find Mr. Right that she falls for her daughter's scheme to set her up with a man who does not exist, each cry five times over the course of 90 minutes. But music fans, don't fret. Hilary's next movie, co-starring sister Haylie, is titled Material Girls. Guess who sings the theme song. Matt Singer
