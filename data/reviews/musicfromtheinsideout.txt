Words sometimes fail, but energy and enthusiasm triumph in "Music From the Inside Out," a docu that quizzes members of the Philadelphia Orchestra about their relationship to music. With coin supplied by the Corp. for Public Broadcasting, film is perfectly pitched for pubcasters worldwide and should harmoniously slot into docu and music fests.
Trying to encapsulate in words the essence of music is a task that would seem destined to fall flat. But the insights of the collected intelligence of the famous 106-year-old orchestra's players are vibrant and stimulating.
Pic is structured in three parts ("Finding a Voice," "Between the Notes," "The Sum of the Parts"), but the divisions are largely superfluous, as themes overlap. The talking heads chosen are sufficiently articulate to make such structural inconsistencies irrelevant.
With a constant underscore of music, from Schubert to Stravinsky, the docu is a soothing sit, but like the orchestra's performers it doesn't confine itself to classical works. Trombonist Nitzan Haroz spends his off-hours playing in Latin-flavored clubs, while violinist Zachary DePue finds release in the rhythms of Bluegrass. French hornist Adam Unsworth is sustained by running marathons, while viola-playing "cinesthesiac" Judy Geist (whose condition, enabling her to see colors in sounds, could sustain a whole docu in itself) paints landscapes.
Some talent is interviewed one-on-one, but most quotes appear to be sourced from what looks like a group therapy session to unlock the secrets of professional musical experience. Some speak of the isolation as music comes from within; others enthuse about the communal experience of performing with an orchestra.
PBS director Daniel Anker ("Scottsboro: An American Tragedy," "Imaginary Witness: Hollywood and the Holocaust") deals with his unwieldy subject admirably, and astute suturing of disparate interviews maintains momentum.
Pic has a pro DV look and transfer to 35mm is good. Sound is impeccable.

What is music? Various members of the Philadelphia Orchestra  respond with stutters and groans, finally admitting that it can only be felt, not verbalized. From that humble start, Music From the Inside Out  follows the group during an international tour, giving an anecdotal sketch of life as a classical musician. Performance is elided in favor of the personal, as the subjects detail their escape into the freedoms of Latin jazz and bluegrass and ponder melody's inherence in memory. The film is a revealing portrait of painfully withdrawn artists navigating the tug between the divine harmony of an orchestral synthesis and the sweaty glow of individual experimentation. The ovation they give a Cologne  street accordionist's version of The Four Seasons  has them leaning toward the latter.
Make It Funky! shows no such ambiguity. Celebrating the idiosyncrasy of New Orleans and its musicians with impunity, it's structured around a 2004 concert that booked legendary local artists (Earl Palmer , the Meters, the Neville Brothers , and more) to celebrate the town's diverse musical history. Interspersed with this footage is the dry enumerating of this history (aside from a tale of Little Richard  lifting a table with his teeth), but one impatiently waits for the performances to return, and there are some stunners. Walter "Wolfman" Washington  growls his way through a rollicking version of "Barefootin'," Snooks Eaglin  wails to his baby to "Come On (Let the Good Times Roll)," and Keith Richards  slurs his way through a truly rocking version of "I'm Ready." A love letter to New Orleans, Make It Funky!  reminds us of what has been lost in the flood, and of an artistic spirit that will never dissipate.
