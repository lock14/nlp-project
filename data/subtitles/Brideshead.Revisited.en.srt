1
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:59,289
<i>If you asked me now who I am,</i>

2
00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:03,064
<i>the only answer I could give
with any certainty</i>

3
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:05,627
<i>would be my name, Charles Ryder.</i>

4
00:01:07,106 --> 00:01:11,543
<i>For the rest, my loves, my hates,</i>

5
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:14,340
<i>down even to my deepest desires,</i>

6
00:01:14,613 --> 00:01:17,678
<i>I can no longer say whether
these emotions are my own</i>

7
00:01:19,218 --> 00:01:22,779
<i>or stolen from those
I once so desperately wished to be.</i>

8
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:29,518
<i>On second thoughts,
one emotion remains my own,</i>

9
00:01:30,896 --> 00:01:34,059
<i>alone among the borrowed
and the second-hand,</i>

10
00:01:35,567 --> 00:01:39,025
<i>as pure as that faith
from which I am still in flight.</i>

11
00:01:41,874 --> 00:01:43,102
<i>Guilt.</i>

12
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:10,568
Been away, sir? Anywhere interesting?

13
00:02:10,836 --> 00:02:13,662
Jungle.
–Jungle.

14
00:02:15,274 --> 00:02:16,434
Explorer, are we?

15
00:02:16,702 --> 00:02:19,341
Painter.
–Painter?

16
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:22,539
So, bye-bye beardy, hello smooth.

17
00:02:35,027 --> 00:02:38,053
Famous for his impressive
architectural portraits,

18
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,464
British artist Charles Ryder
has taken New York by storm

19
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:45,435
with a series of gripping jungle studies.

20
00:02:45,704 --> 00:02:47,631
To own a Ryder is currently the dream

21
00:02:47,831 --> 00:02:50,203
of every self-respecting
East Coast millionaire.

22
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:53,139
You must be so proud of him.

23
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:55,536
Was he away Iong?
–Two years,

24
00:02:55,814 --> 00:02:59,573
and it doesn't feel Iike a day.
–You must feel positively bridal.

25
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,181
I can't paint
to save my Iife.

26
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:04,381
Thank you.

27
00:03:04,581 --> 00:03:06,421
I can't even hold a buggering brush!

28
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:12,160
But I know what I Iike. Lots of color.
Nice and bright.

29
00:03:12,431 --> 00:03:15,394
I see the jungle in your work
as a metaphor.

30
00:03:15,665 --> 00:03:20,529
Not Ieast, the metaphysical semblance
of the chaos at the heart of civilization.

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,437
Make an effort, Charles.

32
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:26,501
You're not in South America now.
You're amongst civilized people.

33
00:04:06,985 --> 00:04:09,985
Mr. Ryder, I wonder if I could …
–I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

34
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:13,384
Excuse me. Thank you very much.
–… just have a conversation …

35
00:05:27,633 --> 00:05:29,191
Hello, Charles.

36
00:06:23,555 --> 00:06:26,581
You're wearing a coat!
–Yes, Father, I am.

37
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:28,558
Why?

38
00:06:28,827 --> 00:06:32,119
I'm going up to Oxford.
–Ah. Yes.

39
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:38,828
Remind me. What are you taking?
–History.

40
00:06:39,104 --> 00:06:41,998
And what allowance have I given you?
–A hundred pounds.

41
00:06:42,274 --> 00:06:46,067
How very indulgent of me.
Mind you, it all comes out of capital.

42
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:51,406
Oh, I suppose this is the time
I should give you advice.

43
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:56,614
Your mother was always
so good at that.

44
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,655
Who's meeting you?

45
00:07:00,926 --> 00:07:02,957
Cousin Jasper offered
to show me around.

46
00:07:03,157 --> 00:07:04,186
Cousin Jasper!

47
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:08,032
Most entertaining.

48
00:07:49,107 --> 00:07:51,072
Out of the way,
you silly fool.

49
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:52,901
There you are, Charles.

50
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:55,106
This way, please.

51
00:07:57,683 --> 00:08:01,881
Come along. As an only child,
you will, of course, have much to Iearn.

52
00:08:02,153 --> 00:08:05,816
Though I am only your cousin, Charles,
you must Iook upon me as a brother.

53
00:08:06,088 --> 00:08:08,558
OIder, wiser,
but a brother nevertheless.

54
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:12,654
Now, it is no secret that our families
are not rich in material wealth.

55
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,062
Keep off the grass.

56
00:08:14,334 --> 00:08:19,798
But I Iike to think that we Ryders are,
all of us, rich in the striving of minds.

57
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,429
Now, then … Not that way.

58
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,067
CIothes. Dress as you do
in a country house.

59
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,738
Never wear a tweed coat
and a flannel trousers, always a suit.

60
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:31,582
And go to a London tailor.
You'II get a better cut.

61
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:34,978
Protocol. First and foremost,
behaving with restraint …

62
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:40,855
Nine adulteries, 12 Iiaisons,
64 fornications,

63
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,360
and something approaching a rape

64
00:08:43,635 --> 00:08:48,832
rest nightly upon the soul
of our delicate friend FIorialis,

65
00:08:49,107 --> 00:08:51,733
and yet the man is so
quiet and reserved in demeanor

66
00:08:52,008 --> 00:08:55,671
that he passes
for both bloodless and sexless.

67
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:02,573
Sodomites, all of them. Steer well clear.

68
00:09:05,484 --> 00:09:08,112
Treat all dons
as you would the Iocal vicar.

69
00:09:08,386 --> 00:09:10,245
With indifference.

70
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,986
Oh, dear, oh, dear. This won't do at all.
You must change your rooms.

71
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,960
I've seen many a man ruined

72
00:09:17,234 --> 00:09:20,191
through having ground floor rooms
in the front quad.

73
00:09:20,465 --> 00:09:21,822
People start dropping in.

74
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:25,428
They Ieave their gowns here
and come and collect them before hall.

75
00:09:25,628 --> 00:09:28,770
You start giving them sherry
and before you know it they're …

76
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:36,747
Sebastian, come along.
Look at the state of him.

77
00:09:37,015 --> 00:09:38,806
Come on, you're nearly clean.

78
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:48,852
Oh, no, no, no, sir, stop.

79
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:52,419
You don't clear up after yourself.
That's my job.

80
00:09:52,694 --> 00:09:55,466
Sorry, Lunt. What's all this?

81
00:09:55,741 --> 00:10:00,836
From the gentleman Iast night, sir.
He just called. Left a note for you.

82
00:10:07,479 --> 00:10:08,810
"I am very contrite.

83
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,372
"PIease come to Iuncheon today.
Sebastian FIyte."

84
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:15,419
The Lord Sebastian FIyte,
don't you know?

85
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:18,978
I'm sure it's quite a pleasure
to clear up after him.

86
00:10:19,624 --> 00:10:22,491
I take it
you'II be out to Iunch today, then, sir.

87
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:25,655
Yes, Lunt. I think I shall be.

88
00:11:08,173 --> 00:11:10,641
I've just counted them.

89
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:14,270
There's five each and two over,
so I'm having the two.

90
00:11:16,181 --> 00:11:18,479
I'm unaccountably hungry today.

91
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:22,241
I put myself unreservedly
in the hands of Dolbear and Goodall

92
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:24,449
and feel so drugged
I've begun to believe

93
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,788
the whole of yesterday evening
was a dream.

94
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,459
PIease don't wake me.

95
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:33,020
Do try one.
–Thank you.

96
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:37,890
What are they?
–PIover's eggs. The first this year.

97
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:43,705
Mummy sends them from Brideshead.
They always Iay early for her.

98
00:11:43,975 --> 00:11:46,471
You would, too, if you knew my mother.

99
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:51,776
Are you terribly angry with me
about Iast night?

100
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:56,082
No, not at all.
Thank you for the flowers.

101
00:11:58,323 --> 00:12:02,123
AIoysius, you can't go there.
Do sit down.

102
00:12:09,734 --> 00:12:11,827
Tell me about you.
–Me?

103
00:12:13,271 --> 00:12:16,331
I'm in my first year, reading history,

104
00:12:18,443 --> 00:12:21,810
but really what I most want to be
is a painter.

105
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,007
Would you Iike to paint me?

106
00:12:26,084 --> 00:12:29,542
Well, yes. Yes, if you Iike.

107
00:12:29,821 --> 00:12:32,112
It's so clever of you,
knowing what you want.

108
00:12:32,312 --> 00:12:33,988
I've no idea what I want.

109
00:12:34,259 --> 00:12:35,822
Except to be happy.

110
00:12:36,828 --> 00:12:38,318
If I can.

111
00:12:38,596 --> 00:12:40,455
Let's have some champagne.

112
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:44,195
A glass each before the rowdies arrive.

113
00:12:48,873 --> 00:12:51,498
<i>You don't want to join the Old Boys.</i>

114
00:12:51,698 --> 00:12:55,344
They're all bloody drugged bogs
or collegers.

115
00:12:55,544 --> 00:12:57,274
Top me up,
will you, old man?

116
00:12:57,474 --> 00:13:00,311
I don't remember you from Eton.
–I didn't go to Eton.

117
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:04,719
Oh, really. Where then?
Harrow or Winchester?

118
00:13:06,378 --> 00:13:08,655
Rugby? Oh, not Charterhouse, I hope?

119
00:13:10,554 --> 00:13:12,486
You wouldn't have heard of it.

120
00:13:12,686 --> 00:13:14,664
There are other schools,
you know, Boy.

121
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:17,000
Yes, I suppose there must be.

122
00:13:20,105 --> 00:13:21,834
My dears.
–Hello, BIanche.

123
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:23,200
Hello, BIanche.

124
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:24,832
I couldn't get away before.

125
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:28,404
I was Iunching
with my preposterous tutor.

126
00:13:28,676 --> 00:13:32,416
I told him I had to change for footer.

127
00:13:39,424 --> 00:13:43,121
Anthony, you remember Charles.
From Iast night?

128
00:13:43,394 --> 00:13:46,254
Charles is reading history,
but he wants to be an artist.

129
00:13:46,454 --> 00:13:48,458
No!
–Why ever not?

130
00:13:48,733 --> 00:13:51,900
Either you are an artist or you are not.
–Hear, hear.

131
00:13:55,173 --> 00:13:57,733
Then I am.
–Interesting.

132
00:13:58,877 --> 00:14:02,142
You have about you
a distinct hint of the pragmatic.

133
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:05,910
What do you want to be an artist for?
I mean, what's the point of it?

134
00:14:06,181 --> 00:14:08,077
Why don't you just
buy a bloody camera

135
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:11,251
and take a bloody photograph
and stop giving yourself airs?

136
00:14:11,451 --> 00:14:14,084
That's what I want to know!
–That's it, go it, Boy!

137
00:14:14,284 --> 00:14:17,159
I don't give myself airs.
–Yes, you do.

138
00:14:17,359 --> 00:14:20,163
And, anyway,
you haven't answered my question.

139
00:14:20,363 --> 00:14:21,960
Come on! Answer!

140
00:14:22,934 --> 00:14:26,335
Answer, answer, answer, answer …
–Yes.

141
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:28,736
Answer, answer, answer, answer …

142
00:14:29,005 --> 00:14:34,302
Because a camera
is a mechanical device

143
00:14:34,571 --> 00:14:37,177
which records a moment in time,

144
00:14:37,446 --> 00:14:42,310
but not what that moment means
or the emotions that it evokes.

145
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,721
Whereas a painting,
however imperfect it may be,

146
00:14:50,061 --> 00:14:52,655
is an expression of feeling.

147
00:14:54,566 --> 00:14:56,466
An expression of Iove.

148
00:14:58,002 --> 00:15:00,197
Not just a copy of something.

149
00:15:04,075 --> 00:15:08,034
And who on earth do you think
cares about your feelings?

150
00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:09,545
I do.

151
00:15:09,757 --> 00:15:12,174
Boy, you're an oaf. Behave yourself.

152
00:15:12,784 --> 00:15:15,252
To art and Iove.

153
00:15:17,989 --> 00:15:20,082
To art and Iove!

154
00:15:24,829 --> 00:15:29,562
We'd just arrived in his rooms, then,
without even a, "By your Ieave,"

155
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:33,501
the Lord FIyte pokes his head
through the window and vomits.

156
00:15:34,205 --> 00:15:37,504
Ground floor rooms, you see.
Poor Charles may never recover.

157
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:39,634
Morning, Jasper.
–Morning.

158
00:15:49,387 --> 00:15:51,586
Two tries out of you today …

159
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:54,018
Charles. You're to come away at once!

160
00:15:54,292 --> 00:15:57,693
I've got a basket of strawberries
and a bottle of Chateau Peyraguey,

161
00:15:57,893 --> 00:16:00,686
which isn't a wine you've ever tasted,
so don't pretend.

162
00:16:00,886 --> 00:16:02,494
It's heaven with strawberries.

163
00:16:21,853 --> 00:16:24,549
Just the place to bury a crock of gold.

164
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,057
I should Iike to bury
something precious

165
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:33,156
in every place where I've been happy.

166
00:16:34,599 --> 00:16:37,762
And, then,
when I was old and ugly and miserable,

167
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:45,507
I could come back
and dig it up and remember.

168
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:01,983
Come along, Charles.
There's someone I want you to meet.

169
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:34,521
Is this where you Iive?
–It's where my family Iive.

170
00:17:37,795 --> 00:17:39,857
Don't worry,
you won't have to meet them.

171
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:43,089
Oh, but I should Iike to.
–You can't. They're away.

172
00:18:07,025 --> 00:18:09,994
Everything's shut up.
We better go this way.

173
00:18:23,675 --> 00:18:24,972
Keep up.

174
00:18:35,687 --> 00:18:38,417
Charles. Charles.

175
00:18:49,734 --> 00:18:54,831
Well, this is a surprise!
How Iovely to see you.

176
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:58,836
Meet my new chum, Charles.

177
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:03,137
Charles, this is Nanny Hawkins.
This is who I wanted you to meet.

178
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:06,581
I don't think I know you, do I?
–How do you do?

179
00:19:06,858 --> 00:19:10,781
Your friend has charming manners.
What family are you from, Charles?

180
00:19:11,058 --> 00:19:14,484
No family. I mean, no one important.
–Charles is an artist.

181
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,993
He's going to paint me.
–How jolly.

182
00:19:20,465 --> 00:19:22,456
You've come at just the right time.

183
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,926
Lady Marchmain's
on her way up from London.

184
00:19:25,126 --> 00:19:26,897
It's the Conservative Women's Tea.

185
00:19:27,104 --> 00:19:28,996
They always turn out for Brideshead.

186
00:19:29,196 --> 00:19:31,301
I'm afraid we may have
to miss them, Nanny.

187
00:19:31,576 --> 00:19:33,305
Your mother will be disappointed.

188
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,606
I'm sure Her Ladyship
would want to meet …

189
00:19:35,806 --> 00:19:38,915
Can't be done, I'm afraid.
Got to get back or we'II be gated.

190
00:19:47,258 --> 00:19:49,954
I pray for my dear Sebastian every day.

191
00:19:52,463 --> 00:19:55,489
Charles!
–It was very nice to meet you.

192
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,106
Come along, Charles.
–Couldn't we just have a quick Iook?

193
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:07,204
We've seen who we came for.
We can go.

194
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:08,540
Just a Iittle Iook.

195
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:47,775
Don't be such a tourist, Charles.

196
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:48,976
If you're that keen,

197
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:52,550
you can see it all for a shilling
on Queen AIexandra's Day.

198
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,119
God, I Ioathe that painting!

199
00:20:59,564 --> 00:21:03,056
I could show you the chapel, I suppose,
if we're quick.

200
00:21:27,058 --> 00:21:29,049
What did you do that for?

201
00:21:30,428 --> 00:21:33,090
You're not Catholic, are you?
–No.

202
00:21:34,532 --> 00:21:38,332
I was just trying to fit in.
–Well, don't.

203
00:21:44,642 --> 00:21:46,109
Come on, come on!

204
00:21:46,377 --> 00:21:48,901
Sorry, I'm afraid I don't have the knack.

205
00:21:49,101 --> 00:21:50,505
Charles, what are you doing?

206
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:56,081
Car. Now.

207
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:31,854
Who was that in the car
with your mother?

208
00:22:32,054 --> 00:22:33,756
My sister.
–What's she Iike?

209
00:22:34,024 --> 00:22:35,448
For goodness sake, Charles,

210
00:22:35,648 --> 00:22:38,290
I don't keep asking you questions
about your family.

211
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,621
But I've never
asked you anything before.

212
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:41,928
You're so inquisitive.

213
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:44,165
Well, you're so mysterious about them.

214
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:47,068
I hoped I was mysterious
about everything.

215
00:22:48,139 --> 00:22:50,330
Why don't you want me
to meet your family?

216
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,338
Who are you ashamed of, them or me?

217
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:53,970
Don't be so vulgar, Charles.

218
00:22:58,716 --> 00:23:03,085
I'm not having you mixed up
with my family. You're my friend.

219
00:23:04,956 --> 00:23:06,924
I don't have a family.

220
00:23:09,427 --> 00:23:10,860
You have me.

221
00:23:15,967 --> 00:23:19,494
Sebastian and Charles,
<i>contra mundum.</i>

222
00:23:23,507 --> 00:23:25,099
<i>Contra mundum.</i>

223
00:23:44,629 --> 00:23:45,891
Father?

224
00:23:48,699 --> 00:23:49,927
Father?

225
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,235
Back already?
–Term's over.

226
00:23:56,507 --> 00:23:57,706
So soon?

227
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:18,583
Thank you.

228
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:21,629
Father, I have to Ieave at once!
–Oh, yes?

229
00:24:21,899 --> 00:24:24,498
A great friend of mine
has had a terrible accident.

230
00:24:24,698 --> 00:24:25,994
I must go to him.
–May I?

231
00:24:29,473 --> 00:24:33,569
"Gravely injured.
Come at once. Sebastian."

232
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,581
I'm sorry you're upset.

233
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:40,207
Reading this message,

234
00:24:40,407 --> 00:24:45,153
I would say that the accident was not
as serious as you seem to suggest

235
00:24:45,422 --> 00:24:49,158
or it would not have been signed
by the victim himself.

236
00:24:51,228 --> 00:24:56,598
Still, of course, he may well be
fully conscious, but horribly paralyzed.

237
00:24:56,801 --> 00:25:00,034
Remind me.
Why is your presence necessary?

238
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:02,902
I told you, he's a great friend.

239
00:25:03,173 --> 00:25:07,774
Well, I shall miss you, my boy,
but don't hurry back on my account.

240
00:25:26,397 --> 00:25:28,194
Take your bag, sir?

241
00:25:34,505 --> 00:25:35,904
Excuse me!

242
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,579
Are you Charles Ryder?

243
00:25:45,116 --> 00:25:47,516
Yes. Sorry. Hello.

244
00:25:47,785 --> 00:25:51,043
I'm Julia, Sebastian's sister.
I've been sent to pick you up.

245
00:25:51,312 --> 00:25:52,817
Hop in, Mr. Ryder.

246
00:25:56,894 --> 00:25:59,886
Case in the back.
–Sorry, yes.

247
00:26:29,393 --> 00:26:30,621
How's Sebastian?

248
00:26:30,894 --> 00:26:33,219
He's fine.
–Fine?

249
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:35,094
Did he tell you he was dying?

250
00:26:35,367 --> 00:26:37,464
Well, I thought … His message said …

251
00:26:37,737 --> 00:26:40,203
I expect he thought
you wouldn't come if you knew.

252
00:26:40,476 --> 00:26:41,794
He's not badly hurt, then?

253
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:45,574
He cracked a bone in his foot
so small it hasn't even got a name.

254
00:26:45,847 --> 00:26:48,203
How did it happen?
–PIaying croquet.

255
00:26:52,683 --> 00:26:55,151
I must admit,
I did think it was a Iittle queer,

256
00:26:55,419 --> 00:26:57,785
you traveling all this way
for a croquet injury.

257
00:26:58,053 --> 00:27:00,317
I don't mind.
It's wonderful to be here again.

258
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,382
Is it? Why?

259
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,860
Well, it's such a beautiful house,
for one thing.

260
00:27:06,128 --> 00:27:07,921
I can't stand the place.

261
00:27:13,304 --> 00:27:15,534
Be an angel and Iight me one.

262
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:55,969
There you are, at Iast!

263
00:27:57,081 --> 00:28:01,074
I thought you were dying.
–I thought I was, too.

264
00:28:01,351 --> 00:28:03,176
The pain was excruciating.

265
00:28:04,688 --> 00:28:07,680
Julia, ask Wilcox
to fetch us some champagne.

266
00:28:07,957 --> 00:28:10,249
I hate champagne.
–For our guest.

267
00:28:12,196 --> 00:28:14,892
Well, take your coat off. You'II boil.

268
00:28:20,604 --> 00:28:22,367
Come along, Charles.

269
00:28:37,187 --> 00:28:39,018
I thought you hated champagne.

270
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:40,381
I do.

271
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:44,484
I suppose Sebastian's told you
all about us?

272
00:28:44,695 --> 00:28:46,895
No. No, nothing at all,
as a matter of fact.

273
00:28:47,095 --> 00:28:48,224
And nor should I.

274
00:28:49,633 --> 00:28:51,225
What?

275
00:28:51,502 --> 00:28:54,499
I take it you're not one of us?
–Don't answer.

276
00:28:54,771 --> 00:28:57,132
I don't Iive Iike this,
if that's what you mean.

277
00:28:57,332 --> 00:28:59,276
She means you're not a Catholic.

278
00:28:59,543 --> 00:29:01,573
Sorry, no. No, nothing at all.

279
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,206
You mean you're an atheist?
–Well, yes, I suppose.

280
00:29:05,473 --> 00:29:07,109
Strictly speaking, we're C of E,

281
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:11,250
but Father only ever goes
for Christmas and funerals.

282
00:29:12,222 --> 00:29:14,156
He Iikes those.

283
00:29:14,424 --> 00:29:17,159
What about your mother?
–She's dead.

284
00:29:18,862 --> 00:29:20,489
I was very young.

285
00:29:20,757 --> 00:29:23,032
She died working for the Red Cross.

286
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,058
Which, given her devotion to good,

287
00:29:25,258 --> 00:29:27,829
does rather point up
the arbitrariness of it all.

288
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:31,466
I see. So, you're here arbitrarily?

289
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:34,067
He's here as my friend.

290
00:29:35,612 --> 00:29:38,308
Given Mr. Ryder's
staunch position on religion,

291
00:29:38,582 --> 00:29:41,350
don't you think he ought to know
what he's getting into?

292
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,815
Leave Charles out of it.

293
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:44,981
Tell me.
–Oh, God.

294
00:29:45,181 --> 00:29:48,081
Mummy takes her faith
very seriously, indeed.

295
00:29:48,281 --> 00:29:51,685
So seriously, in fact,
that our fat Iittle priest, Father Mackay,

296
00:29:51,885 --> 00:29:53,787
called her a Iiving saint.

297
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:56,796
Mind you, he drinks.

298
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:59,301
Sebastian and I
are a couple of heathens.

299
00:29:59,572 --> 00:30:03,431
I'm not a heathen, I'm a sinner.
Cast out from God's Iove.

300
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:06,840
As for you,
you're not a heathen at all, not really.

301
00:30:07,978 --> 00:30:10,913
Why do we always end up
talking about family?

302
00:30:12,249 --> 00:30:14,114
It's time for my bath.

303
00:30:16,153 --> 00:30:19,179
Good evening, Mr. Ryder.
Look after my brother.

304
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:31,666
I don't think your sister
Iikes me very much.

305
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:34,131
I don't think
she cares for anyone much.

306
00:30:35,272 --> 00:30:36,637
I Iove her.

307
00:30:37,875 --> 00:30:39,433
She's Iike me.

308
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:43,273
Drink in remembrance of me.

309
00:30:48,018 --> 00:30:49,107
Hang on.

310
00:31:18,782 --> 00:31:22,149
In fact, I know that that's checkmate.

311
00:31:28,025 --> 00:31:29,390
Come here.

312
00:31:32,696 --> 00:31:35,290
<i>If only it could be
like this always.</i>

313
00:31:36,633 --> 00:31:38,123
AIways summer.

314
00:31:39,603 --> 00:31:41,093
<i>Always alone.</i>

315
00:31:42,306 --> 00:31:43,967
Fruit always ripe.

316
00:31:54,251 --> 00:31:55,445
Cheers.

317
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:02,819
Now,

318
00:32:05,295 --> 00:32:06,887
try this.

319
00:32:16,106 --> 00:32:19,473
No?
–It's a shy Iittle wine. Like a gazelle.

320
00:32:24,081 --> 00:32:27,175
Like a Ieprechaun.
–Dappled in a tapestry meadow.

321
00:32:29,052 --> 00:32:31,077
A flute by still water.

322
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:37,189
This is a wise old wine.

323
00:32:43,567 --> 00:32:45,933
A prophet in a cave.

324
00:32:46,203 --> 00:32:47,402
And this

325
00:32:49,406 --> 00:32:52,068
is a string of pearls on a white neck.

326
00:32:57,614 --> 00:33:00,913
A swan.
–The Iast unicorn.

327
00:33:53,804 --> 00:33:55,294
Who's that?

328
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:05,780
Is that your brother?
–Yes, that's Bridey.

329
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,913
He seems all right to me.
–Wait till you meet him.

330
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:17,020
Mother.

331
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:31,504
Hello, there.

332
00:34:31,775 --> 00:34:33,509
Go away,
we're not decent!

333
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,341
Mummy's here.
–We know.

334
00:34:36,612 --> 00:34:38,813
She's invited Charles to dinner.

335
00:34:47,591 --> 00:34:49,855
It's not
what we agreed upon, Sebastian,

336
00:34:50,126 --> 00:34:53,093
when we talked about this
at Christmas, when you came down.

337
00:34:53,293 --> 00:34:55,764
It's no use crying, darling.
That's just childish.

338
00:34:57,601 --> 00:35:00,627
That's not going to help, is it?

339
00:35:00,904 --> 00:35:03,298
You see, darling,
whatever yesterday's sins,

340
00:35:03,575 --> 00:35:06,103
we must all pray for God's forgiveness.

341
00:35:07,678 --> 00:35:12,843
So now, you try and try again now.

342
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,317
Be a good boy.
For God and for Mummy.

343
00:35:21,191 --> 00:35:24,388
Now, just put your shirt on now.

344
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,361
Dining room's this way.

345
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:33,862
Is Sebastian all right?
He seemed upset.

346
00:35:34,271 --> 00:35:35,360
Oh.

347
00:35:36,006 --> 00:35:38,566
He and Mummy often have these talks.

348
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,307
FIannels for dinner?
Very bold, Mr. Ryder.

349
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,577
Will your mother mind?
–Yes, she'II be appalled.

350
00:35:47,684 --> 00:35:51,142
No, don't worry.
She'II be understanding.

351
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:54,384
Do you often do that?
–What?

352
00:35:54,657 --> 00:35:58,861
Say one thing, mean another?
–Yes and no.

353
00:36:18,482 --> 00:36:19,915
Thank you.

354
00:36:29,226 --> 00:36:30,818
Amen.
–Amen.

355
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:37,898
Welcome to Brideshead, Mr. Ryder.
I've been hearing all about you.

356
00:36:38,168 --> 00:36:42,200
I do hope you didn't Iet Sebastian
call you away in too much of a rush.

357
00:36:42,472 --> 00:36:45,500
I'm afraid I didn't quite have time
to pack the right things.

358
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,911
Sebastian must Iend you some clothes
while you're here.

359
00:36:49,179 --> 00:36:51,140
Or perhaps Bridey's a better fit.

360
00:36:51,408 --> 00:36:53,512
Are you a Bridey
or a Sebastian, Mr. Ryder?

361
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,713
He can't borrow Bridey's clothes.
Bridey dresses Iike a bank clerk.

362
00:36:57,981 --> 00:37:01,519
Don't be vulgar, Cordelia.
Vulgar is not the same as funny.

363
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,586
I hope you've been
Iooked after properly, Ryder.

364
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:09,257
Has Sebastian
been seeing to the wine?

365
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:13,330
Yes. Sebastian's been
seeing to the wine.

366
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,268
Delighted to hear it.

367
00:37:16,773 --> 00:37:19,867
You're fond of wine?
–Yes, very.

368
00:37:20,144 --> 00:37:23,003
I wish I were.
It's such a bond with other men.

369
00:37:24,381 --> 00:37:28,210
At Christ Church, I tried to get drunk
more than once, but I didn't enjoy it.

370
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:30,109
What do you enjoy, Bridey?

371
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:35,148
Hunting, shooting,

372
00:37:37,561 --> 00:37:38,858
fishing.

373
00:37:41,765 --> 00:37:45,166
And what form do your pleasures take,
Mr. Ryder?

374
00:37:45,435 --> 00:37:47,499
Sorry, pleasures?
–Your hobbies.

375
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:49,595
What do you do to relax?
–He drinks.

376
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:52,733
Drinking is not a hobby, Sebastian.

377
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:55,607
You Iive in London, is that correct?
–Yes.

378
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:58,113
Whereabouts?
–Paddington.

379
00:37:59,983 --> 00:38:02,076
You Iive in a railway station?

380
00:38:02,352 --> 00:38:07,385
No, no. Sorry. No, I Iive nearby.

381
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:08,719
I see.

382
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,784
And has this Ied
to an interest in trains?

383
00:38:14,064 --> 00:38:15,554
No.

384
00:38:15,832 --> 00:38:19,693
So, are you close
with Sebastian's crowd?

385
00:38:22,105 --> 00:38:23,470
Not really.

386
00:38:23,748 --> 00:38:28,273
With Anthony BIanche?
–We're acquainted.

387
00:38:29,246 --> 00:38:31,476
Charles is a painter, Mummy.

388
00:38:33,383 --> 00:38:35,146
How charming.

389
00:38:35,418 --> 00:38:37,542
We must get you
to paint something for us.

390
00:38:37,742 --> 00:38:40,185
Would you do that, Mr. Ryder?
–I'd be delighted.

391
00:38:40,385 --> 00:38:43,956
I think Brideshead's the most
beautiful house I've ever seen.

392
00:38:47,097 --> 00:38:49,998
It's utterly magical.
–How kind you are.

393
00:38:52,736 --> 00:38:54,533
Summer at Brideshead.

394
00:38:55,305 --> 00:38:58,433
Mr. Ryder must stay with us
for the rest of the vacation.

395
00:38:58,708 --> 00:39:01,568
As a matter of fact,
I've just heard from Papa.

396
00:39:02,646 --> 00:39:05,410
He wants me to go and see him
in Venice. And Julia.

397
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:07,074
I see.

398
00:39:07,346 --> 00:39:09,545
And do you intend
to accept this invitation?

399
00:39:09,817 --> 00:39:10,984
Yes. Why not?

400
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:13,221
What about you, Julia?
Will you be going?

401
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:14,486
I'd Iike to.

402
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,785
Wouldn't you rather
stay at Brideshead?

403
00:39:22,332 --> 00:39:25,358
Well, yes, if you want me to.

404
00:39:28,204 --> 00:39:32,334
You must not neglect your duty.
–No, Mother.

405
00:39:39,416 --> 00:39:43,375
I think we might spend a Iittle time
in the chapel after dinner.

406
00:39:44,788 --> 00:39:49,122
Would you join us, Mr. Ryder?
–Thank you.

407
00:39:49,392 --> 00:39:51,683
You do know Charles is an atheist?

408
00:39:53,363 --> 00:39:55,228
An agnostic, surely.

409
00:39:57,267 --> 00:39:58,791
Actually, no.

410
00:40:00,103 --> 00:40:04,369
But you'II join us, anyway,
out of curiosity.

411
00:40:06,643 --> 00:40:08,008
Thank you.

412
00:40:12,983 --> 00:40:15,747
No Sebastian?
–No, Mummy.

413
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:19,978
Charles, are you really an atheist?

414
00:40:21,391 --> 00:40:25,293
Yes, I am.
–How awful for you.

415
00:40:25,562 --> 00:40:27,455
I'II put you on my prayer Iist.

416
00:40:27,724 --> 00:40:31,933
I have a Iong Iist of people I pray for,
including six black Cordelias in Africa.

417
00:40:32,202 --> 00:40:35,163
It's a new thing. You send five bob
to some nuns in Africa,

418
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:37,206
and they christen a baby after you.

419
00:40:37,473 --> 00:40:38,662
Right.

420
00:40:39,109 --> 00:40:43,045
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

421
00:40:43,313 --> 00:40:46,014
Give us this day our daily bread,

422
00:40:46,282 --> 00:40:48,141
and forgive us our trespasses

423
00:40:48,409 --> 00:40:51,619
as we forgive
those who trespass against us.

424
00:40:51,887 --> 00:40:56,954
And Iead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

425
00:40:57,222 --> 00:40:58,353
Amen.

426
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:42,429
Have you ever
been to Venice, Mr. Ryder?

427
00:41:42,705 --> 00:41:44,496
No. No, I haven't.

428
00:41:44,772 --> 00:41:48,101
Every ambitious young man
should visit Venice.

429
00:41:48,377 --> 00:41:50,772
It makes one sound more complete.

430
00:41:52,882 --> 00:41:57,842
I was thinking, if Sebastian were to go,

431
00:41:58,118 --> 00:42:01,379
it might be a good thing
if you were to accompany him.

432
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:05,253
He needs someone plausible
by his side.

433
00:42:06,329 --> 00:42:11,892
I gather Iast time he was there, he was
befriending some very odd types.

434
00:42:12,168 --> 00:42:14,698
It's youthful high spirits, I understand,

435
00:42:15,572 --> 00:42:20,407
but in the end,
we must all accept God's Iimits.

436
00:42:22,245 --> 00:42:24,008
Atheist, or no.

437
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:31,644
I know I can rely on you.

438
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:35,385
You seem to me
a very reliable young man.

439
00:43:12,195 --> 00:43:15,631
San Giovanni e Paolo.
–Oh, dear.

440
00:43:15,898 --> 00:43:18,826
I can see
you're going to be impossibly curious.

441
00:43:19,093 --> 00:43:23,031
By the way, I should warn you.
Our Iovely father is rather a scoundrel.

442
00:43:23,298 --> 00:43:25,802
He Iives
in one of the palazzos with Cara.

443
00:43:26,069 --> 00:43:27,934
Who's Cara?
–His mistress.

444
00:43:29,179 --> 00:43:31,909
Poor Papa's rather shunned by society.

445
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:34,472
Not the Italians, of course.
They adore him.

446
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:42,891
Santa Maria dei Miracoli.
–I know. I've seen the postcard.

447
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,716
My dear boy!
–Darling, Papa.

448
00:44:15,758 --> 00:44:17,726
You Iook so young!
–Do you think so?

449
00:44:17,994 --> 00:44:21,054
I've taken to playing tennis
at the Lido with a professional.

450
00:44:21,322 --> 00:44:23,157
Cara thinks I'm getting far too fat.

451
00:44:23,425 --> 00:44:24,460
Julia, come here.

452
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:27,164
Father.
–My child.

453
00:44:27,437 --> 00:44:30,301
I wasn't sure if you'd come.
–Mummy gave me her blessing.

454
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,032
BIessed by your mother.
What a saint that woman is.

455
00:44:33,232 --> 00:44:35,636
You know, I used to try everything
to please her.

456
00:44:35,836 --> 00:44:37,774
Julia, this is your friend, Mr. Ryder?

457
00:44:37,974 --> 00:44:39,844
Charles is my friend, Papa.
–I see.

458
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,312
Delighted.
–How do you do, sir?

459
00:44:42,585 --> 00:44:46,185
Welcome to Venice.
–Here's Cara. Now we can eat.

460
00:44:46,458 --> 00:44:48,224
Come along now. This way.

461
00:45:01,905 --> 00:45:04,772
Don't Iook so greedy. It won't go away.

462
00:45:05,909 --> 00:45:07,137
Sorry.

463
00:45:12,081 --> 00:45:14,606
I wasn't sure you'd come to Venice.

464
00:45:15,885 --> 00:45:17,816
Your father seemed
pleased to see you.

465
00:45:18,016 --> 00:45:20,585
I'm not sure Father
cares much if I come.

466
00:45:20,857 --> 00:45:23,649
He'd probably be just as happy
if it was only Sebastian.

467
00:45:23,921 --> 00:45:27,526
They adore each other.
They're alike in so many ways.

468
00:45:29,532 --> 00:45:31,397
Who are you Iike?
–Me?

469
00:45:32,001 --> 00:45:33,090
Oh.

470
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,232
Nobody.

471
00:45:36,172 --> 00:45:38,072
I'm the family shadow.

472
00:45:44,147 --> 00:45:45,409
Drinks.

473
00:45:48,851 --> 00:45:51,684
Julia.
–Cara.

474
00:45:54,023 --> 00:45:57,823
Mr. Ryder, Sebastian tells me
you are a painter.

475
00:45:58,094 --> 00:46:00,454
Charles is an artist.
–Good.

476
00:46:00,725 --> 00:46:04,796
Well, then I will show you all the
great art of Canaletto and Veronese.

477
00:46:05,768 --> 00:46:08,532
He never goes anywhere.
Such a philistine.

478
00:46:08,804 --> 00:46:12,301
I don't mind the art.
It's religion I can't stand.

479
00:46:12,573 --> 00:46:15,435
The Italians seem unable
to paint anything half decent

480
00:46:15,707 --> 00:46:18,309
without putting Christ dying in it.

481
00:46:18,581 --> 00:46:20,410
Of course, your mother Ioved Italy.

482
00:46:20,610 --> 00:46:23,049
A pieta on every street corner.
–Don't be cruel.

483
00:46:23,319 --> 00:46:26,953
On the contrary, she'd be flattered.
God was always her first Iove.

484
00:46:27,223 --> 00:46:29,623
Mummy Ioves all of us equally.
–Come now, Julia.

485
00:46:29,893 --> 00:46:31,960
You were the one who walked away!

486
00:46:38,067 --> 00:46:41,332
What must you think of us, Mr. Ryder?

487
00:46:41,602 --> 00:46:44,567
A family of monsters, are we not?
–No, not at all.

488
00:46:46,109 --> 00:46:48,543
I Iost my mother when I was young.

489
00:46:53,816 --> 00:46:59,345
Tell me, Mr. Ryder, as an artist,
what did you make of Brideshead?

490
00:47:00,523 --> 00:47:02,286
I thought it was magnificent.

491
00:47:02,558 --> 00:47:05,623
You think that? Really?

492
00:47:05,895 --> 00:47:08,027
And now, here you are in Venice.

493
00:47:08,931 --> 00:47:10,990
What a Iot of temptations.

494
00:47:27,683 --> 00:47:32,086
He walks for two hours
every day. He wants to be immortal.

495
00:47:32,355 --> 00:47:35,613
But he's quite fragile, you know, inside.

496
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:40,127
That woman nearly suffocated him.

497
00:47:41,731 --> 00:47:47,169
She's been very kind to me.
–Oh, yes. I'm sure. But you will see.

498
00:47:48,504 --> 00:47:50,404
Well, just Iook at her children.

499
00:47:50,673 --> 00:47:53,135
Even when they were tiny,
in the nursery,

500
00:47:53,409 --> 00:47:55,406
they must do
what she want them to do,

501
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:57,069
be what she want them to be.

502
00:47:57,346 --> 00:47:59,410
Only then, would she Iove them.

503
00:48:01,017 --> 00:48:06,421
It's not Lady Marchmain's fault.
Her God has done that to her.

504
00:48:06,689 --> 00:48:09,117
But surely you're Catholic, too?

505
00:48:09,385 --> 00:48:12,093
Yes, but a different sort.

506
00:48:12,361 --> 00:48:16,655
It's different in Italy. Not so much guilt.

507
00:48:16,923 --> 00:48:21,396
We do what the heart tell us,
and then we go to confession.

508
00:48:29,879 --> 00:48:32,575
Sebastian Ioves you very much, I think.

509
00:48:34,484 --> 00:48:35,573
There you are.

510
00:48:35,773 --> 00:48:40,045
They're very good,
these romantic English friendships,

511
00:48:40,323 --> 00:48:42,887
if they don't go on too Iong.

512
00:48:45,194 --> 00:48:49,187
For you, it's just a,
how do you say, "a phase"?

513
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:54,632
But I think it's more than that
for poor Sebastian.

514
00:49:00,676 --> 00:49:02,803
Tread carefully, Mr. Ryder.

515
00:49:07,049 --> 00:49:08,311
Come on.

516
00:49:09,752 --> 00:49:12,346
Hello.
–No! No!

517
00:49:18,294 --> 00:49:19,556
Come on.

518
00:49:20,997 --> 00:49:22,259
Got you.

519
00:50:15,151 --> 00:50:17,915
Can't sleep.
–Try pajamas.

520
00:50:24,694 --> 00:50:28,130
I enjoyed the beach today.
I hope I wasn't too rough.

521
00:50:28,331 --> 00:50:30,028
You were very sweet.

522
00:50:35,905 --> 00:50:37,202
Charles?

523
00:50:39,442 --> 00:50:41,103
There you are.

524
00:50:50,553 --> 00:50:51,815
Sorry.

525
00:50:54,156 --> 00:50:55,680
Lots to drink.

526
00:50:59,695 --> 00:51:02,027
I'm so glad you're here.

527
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:04,965
I'm glad you're here.
–I'm glad I came.

528
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:08,868
Did I say I'm glad you're here?
–You're really glad I'm here?

529
00:51:21,651 --> 00:51:24,381
Let's get plastered.
If you want.

530
00:51:24,587 --> 00:51:28,150
Oh, yes, I do. I want. I want.

531
00:51:36,699 --> 00:51:38,826
There's a wonderful chapel
near here!

532
00:51:39,032 --> 00:51:41,995
You will see a masterpiece, I tell you.

533
00:52:01,557 --> 00:52:03,923
The devil's got his eye on you!

534
00:52:07,263 --> 00:52:09,629
Well, then you must protect me.

535
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:33,448
Julia!

536
00:53:22,271 --> 00:53:23,636
Julia.

537
00:53:23,906 --> 00:53:26,800
I got Iost. AII those people.

538
00:53:59,508 --> 00:54:01,305
What are you doing?

539
00:54:03,612 --> 00:54:05,273
What's the matter?

540
00:54:08,117 --> 00:54:09,206
No!

541
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:27,024
Funny old religion, isn't it?

542
00:55:30,966 --> 00:55:32,365
Sebastian,

543
00:55:35,738 --> 00:55:39,401
what happened just now …
I never meant you to …

544
00:55:43,178 --> 00:55:45,669
If I'd known it was going to happen,

545
00:55:48,284 --> 00:55:49,945
I'd never have …

546
00:55:53,022 --> 00:55:55,616
I don't know what I'm supposed to …

547
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,917
Checkmate.

548
00:57:01,156 --> 00:57:06,025
I'm boring you.
Perhaps it is dull for you here.

549
00:57:07,429 --> 00:57:09,556
You've been enjoying yourself?

550
00:57:09,832 --> 00:57:12,931
I've been in Venice.
–Oh, yes, yes, I suppose so.

551
00:57:14,703 --> 00:57:19,163
The friend you were
so much concerned about, did he die?

552
00:57:22,378 --> 00:57:25,074
No.
–I'm very thankful.

553
00:57:25,347 --> 00:57:29,140
You should have written to tell me.
I worried about him so much.

554
00:57:44,733 --> 00:57:46,963
Watch out, FIyte!
Sebastian!

555
00:57:49,972 --> 00:57:52,406
Sebastian!
–Leave me alone!

556
00:57:56,178 --> 00:57:59,477
Damn. Where is he? The bastard.
–Who?

557
00:57:59,681 --> 00:58:01,742
Mr. Samgrass.
–Who's Mr. Samgrass?

558
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:04,980
One of Mummy's gang.
Fat Iittle Catholic from AII Souls.

559
00:58:05,254 --> 00:58:07,081
Bastard's been set up to follow me.

560
00:58:07,281 --> 00:58:09,719
I wouldn't mind
if he wasn't so infernally ugly.

561
00:58:09,919 --> 00:58:12,549
God, I feel a hundred years old.

562
00:58:12,749 --> 00:58:15,222
Why haven't you called round?
I've been worried.

563
00:58:15,422 --> 00:58:18,733
I was beginning to think
they hadn't sent you up.

564
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:21,269
Since Venice.
–Yes.

565
00:58:26,075 --> 00:58:29,005
Damn! There he is again.
–Who? What are you talking about?

566
00:58:29,205 --> 00:58:30,911
Mr. Samgrass! There!
–Do you mind?

567
00:58:31,111 --> 00:58:33,211
Mummy's hired him to watch me.

568
00:58:33,411 --> 00:58:35,648
What does he want?
–My head on a plate.

569
00:58:35,848 --> 00:58:39,916
Look, if he's bothering you,
I can stop him.

570
00:58:42,324 --> 00:58:45,987
Dear Charles, always so certain.

571
00:58:47,162 --> 00:58:50,620
I'm not certain of anything.
–Aren't you?

572
00:58:55,537 --> 00:58:58,563
By the way, Mummy's here.

573
00:59:00,275 --> 00:59:02,243
She has to talk to you.

574
00:59:03,879 --> 00:59:06,143
Probably wants you
to spy on me as well.

575
00:59:06,415 --> 00:59:07,978
Don't be Iike that.

576
00:59:09,551 --> 00:59:12,952
Why don't I come round
to your rooms Iater?

577
00:59:13,224 --> 00:59:15,751
I'm not sure I want to see you anymore.

578
00:59:29,438 --> 00:59:30,905
I'm so sorry.

579
00:59:50,092 --> 00:59:51,957
So, Charles,

580
00:59:54,897 --> 00:59:57,422
how was Venice?
–Venice was fine.

581
00:59:58,867 --> 01:00:02,667
A strange way to put it.
–It was beautiful.

582
01:00:02,938 --> 01:00:05,070
Speaking as an artist or a man?

583
01:00:07,576 --> 01:00:10,545
I want a word with you
about Sebastian.

584
01:00:10,816 --> 01:00:12,580
I'm concerned about him.

585
01:00:14,383 --> 01:00:15,850
Tea?
–No, thank you.

586
01:00:16,885 --> 01:00:18,985
Why? Should I be?
–He's drinking too much.

587
01:00:19,185 --> 01:00:22,756
You must have noticed.
After all, I sent you to Iook after him.

588
01:00:23,792 --> 01:00:26,089
Yes, I suppose
we both drink too much, really.

589
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,290
No, not at all. You drink to get drunk,

590
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:31,423
Sebastian drinks to escape
the claims of his conscience.

591
01:00:34,803 --> 01:00:37,833
I do wish I could understand
why he's so particularly upset.

592
01:00:38,033 --> 01:00:41,303
Ever since he came back from Venice,
he's been unreachable.

593
01:00:42,110 --> 01:00:45,637
Did something happen there?
–No.

594
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:51,085
You all had a good time?
–Yes.

595
01:00:52,321 --> 01:00:54,721
I wonder what it could have been.

596
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:00,289
I hope you didn't Iet Julia mislead you.

597
01:01:01,463 --> 01:01:04,261
I don't understand.
–I think you do.

598
01:01:05,801 --> 01:01:06,825
PIease understand,

599
01:01:07,102 --> 01:01:10,770
I would not want you
to make yourself Iook foolish, Charles.

600
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:16,509
Her future is not a question of choice.
It is a matter of faith.

601
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:21,538
Were it simply
a difference in upbringing,

602
01:01:21,815 --> 01:01:23,346
this I might overlook.

603
01:01:23,623 --> 01:01:25,750
But you are a self-proclaimed atheist,

604
01:01:26,027 --> 01:01:29,587
and my daughter
is destined to marry a Catholic.

605
01:01:29,864 --> 01:01:31,785
God commands and we obey.

606
01:01:34,296 --> 01:01:36,124
However, we're forgetting ourselves.

607
01:01:36,324 --> 01:01:38,959
We're here to talk
about your friendship with my son.

608
01:01:39,159 --> 01:01:41,827
I'm not sure Sebastian
wants to be my friend anymore.

609
01:01:42,027 --> 01:01:43,130
Because of Julia?

610
01:01:44,172 --> 01:01:46,697
But that is all cleared up now.

611
01:01:46,975 --> 01:01:49,004
We're giving a ball for Julia's 21 st.

612
01:01:49,204 --> 01:01:51,205
I'd Iike you
to keep Sebastian company.

613
01:01:52,314 --> 01:01:54,373
You came to Brideshead
as my son's friend.

614
01:01:54,649 --> 01:01:57,714
If you have
unaccountably offended him,

615
01:01:57,990 --> 01:02:01,620
it is surely not too much to ask
that you revisit your responsibilities.

616
01:02:03,392 --> 01:02:06,919
To him or to you?
–To the family.

617
01:02:09,932 --> 01:02:11,832
And, of course,

618
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,927
Brideshead does Iook particularly
beautiful at this time of year.

619
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,299
Tell me, I'm curious.

620
01:02:21,977 --> 01:02:24,810
Since, as you claim,
you have no religion,

621
01:02:26,481 --> 01:02:29,575
what do you imagine
you are doing on this earth?

622
01:02:31,553 --> 01:02:33,953
Living my Iife, the same as you.

623
01:02:34,221 --> 01:02:37,549
But without faith,
what could your purpose possibly be?

624
01:02:41,363 --> 01:02:43,991
I want to Iook back and say that I was

625
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:45,789
alive.

626
01:02:47,669 --> 01:02:51,366
That I didn't turn my back. That I tried.

627
01:02:53,575 --> 01:02:55,338
That I was happy.

628
01:02:55,544 --> 01:02:58,345
Happiness in this Iife is irrelevant.

629
01:02:58,551 --> 01:03:00,574
AII that matters,

630
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:05,848
the only thing of consequence,
is the Iife hereafter.

631
01:03:16,932 --> 01:03:18,957
Ready for the off.

632
01:03:20,102 --> 01:03:22,730
A beautiful day for it, isn't it? Come on.

633
01:03:50,966 --> 01:03:55,369
Funny, isn't it?
It's my Iittle present to the family.

634
01:03:55,637 --> 01:03:58,600
Rex Mottram. How do you do?
–Charles Ryder.

635
01:03:59,341 --> 01:04:02,401
Good to meet you, Charles.
Heard all about you.

636
01:04:03,045 --> 01:04:06,242
We should compare notes some time.

637
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,509
Going on the hunt?
–I don't think so.

638
01:04:08,777 --> 01:04:12,041
Wise man. Load of English
blue bloods on horseback.

639
01:04:12,954 --> 01:04:14,888
Got to fit in, though!

640
01:04:28,103 --> 01:04:29,502
Who is it?

641
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,206
It's me.

642
01:04:36,211 --> 01:04:39,009
You could have knocked.
I nearly spilt my drink.

643
01:04:39,281 --> 01:04:40,375
I did.

644
01:04:43,718 --> 01:04:45,049
Sit down.

645
01:05:16,084 --> 01:05:18,678
If only it could be Iike this always.

646
01:05:19,488 --> 01:05:22,150
AIways summer.
–Ancient history.

647
01:05:23,792 --> 01:05:25,521
Pass me a towel.

648
01:05:41,510 --> 01:05:43,842
Where's that damn shirt?

649
01:05:45,747 --> 01:05:48,910
You're shaking. What is it?
What's the matter?

650
01:05:50,886 --> 01:05:52,854
Don't you know, Charles?

651
01:05:54,156 --> 01:05:56,886
"Why this is hell, nor am I out of it."

652
01:05:57,459 --> 01:06:00,587
Sebastian, if I've ever done anything …
–It's not you.

653
01:06:01,763 --> 01:06:03,128
It's me.

654
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:12,672
For God's sake, do stop mooning at me
Iike a great big cow!

655
01:06:14,676 --> 01:06:16,007
I'm fine.

656
01:06:17,946 --> 01:06:21,040
I'm fine so Iong
as I've got plenty of this.

657
01:06:21,316 --> 01:06:24,449
I want you to know that
whatever happened in Venice,

658
01:06:24,953 --> 01:06:28,582
I'm not in your mother's gang,
if that's what you think.

659
01:06:30,292 --> 01:06:32,089
I'm on your side.

660
01:06:33,562 --> 01:06:34,651
<i>Contra mundum.</i>

661
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:40,829
Dear Charles,

662
01:06:45,106 --> 01:06:47,472
you're not in anybody's gang.

663
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:51,101
That's always been your problem.

664
01:07:00,956 --> 01:07:04,790
Why are you going on the hunt?
I thought you detested hunting.

665
01:07:05,660 --> 01:07:06,854
I do.

666
01:07:09,064 --> 01:07:12,329
I'm going to Ieave Bridey
at the first covert,

667
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,234
hack over to the nearest pub,
and spend the whole day drinking.

668
01:07:18,807 --> 01:07:20,704
If they treat me Iike a dipsomaniac,

669
01:07:20,904 --> 01:07:22,905
they can bloody well
have a dipsomaniac.

670
01:07:23,278 --> 01:07:24,973
Well, they can't stop you.

671
01:07:25,246 --> 01:07:27,276
They can, as a matter of fact,

672
01:07:30,452 --> 01:07:34,411
by not giving me any money.
They've stopped my bank account.

673
01:07:36,725 --> 01:07:39,489
I've pawned my watch
and cigarette case.

674
01:07:40,962 --> 01:07:43,021
That Iasted for a bit,

675
01:07:44,833 --> 01:07:46,858
but that's all gone now.

676
01:07:48,336 --> 01:07:50,497
So, regretfully …

677
01:07:51,373 --> 01:07:53,637
Sebastian, I can't do that.

678
01:07:54,743 --> 01:07:57,803
I thought you were on my side.
–I am.

679
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,346
Well, then.

680
01:07:59,981 --> 01:08:02,347
Look, why don't I come with you?

681
01:08:03,184 --> 01:08:05,516
It's miserable drinking alone.

682
01:08:06,087 --> 01:08:08,352
We could get drunk together,
Iike we used to.

683
01:08:08,552 --> 01:08:09,612
No.

684
01:08:10,892 --> 01:08:12,689
I'm past all that.

685
01:08:13,928 --> 01:08:15,896
Thanks for the offer.

686
01:08:19,401 --> 01:08:20,561
Well?

687
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:24,434
Are you with me or against me?

688
01:08:51,466 --> 01:08:54,299
Little bit further up
on the shoulder, though.

689
01:08:54,569 --> 01:08:55,836
Sarah, Iook.

690
01:08:56,938 --> 01:08:58,633
Sort of up here.

691
01:09:52,694 --> 01:09:56,960
Ladies and gentlemen,
it gives me great pleasure to announce,

692
01:09:57,230 --> 01:09:59,966
on top of the birthday festivities,

693
01:10:00,236 --> 01:10:04,164
the engagement of my eldest daughter,
the Lady Julia FIyte

694
01:10:04,434 --> 01:10:06,036
to Mr. Rex Mottram.

695
01:10:19,854 --> 01:10:22,186
Yes,
it's marvelous, isn't it.

696
01:10:28,363 --> 01:10:31,799
Thank you, Charles. I'd Iove to dance.
–Cordelia.

697
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:34,460
Cordelia, I'm …
–Come along!

698
01:10:44,712 --> 01:10:46,270
Charles?
–Hmm?

699
01:10:47,081 --> 01:10:51,142
I hope you don't mind me asking,
but modern art,

700
01:10:51,786 --> 01:10:55,278
it is all bosh, isn't it?
–Yes, it's all bosh.

701
01:10:55,545 --> 01:10:57,290
Good. I thought so.

702
01:11:00,628 --> 01:11:02,721
Get a grip, Charles!

703
01:11:03,965 --> 01:11:06,934
Rex! Rex, I need a better dancer.

704
01:11:07,936 --> 01:11:10,564
Yours for five minutes and no more.

705
01:11:10,838 --> 01:11:12,663
Come along.
–Okay.

706
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:17,275
You're rather tall,
aren't you?

707
01:11:17,549 --> 01:11:19,074
Is that a handicap?

708
01:11:39,434 --> 01:11:41,425
Why didn't you tell me?

709
01:11:43,171 --> 01:11:45,833
It's not Sebastian. I don't believe that.

710
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:47,898
Charles, I can't do this.

711
01:11:48,309 --> 01:11:50,777
When we kissed …
–PIease, stop!

712
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,012
Why? It was wonderful.

713
01:11:56,751 --> 01:11:58,048
I know.

714
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:04,388
I think about it all the time.

715
01:12:06,895 --> 01:12:08,692
I have no choice.

716
01:12:25,613 --> 01:12:28,582
Oh, Sebastian.
–Never mind.

717
01:12:33,555 --> 01:12:35,489
Oh, Charles.
–Don't!

718
01:12:40,228 --> 01:12:42,496
Come along, old boy.
–I don't want your help.

719
01:12:42,696 --> 01:12:44,890
You're in tweed, Sebastian.
This is a ball.

720
01:12:45,090 --> 01:12:47,400
Bugger off, Bridey.
You're worse than wet.

721
01:12:50,939 --> 01:12:53,840
You see … What it is …

722
01:12:54,108 --> 01:12:56,206
I hate you all so very much!

723
01:12:56,978 --> 01:12:59,105
Sebastian.
–Get off me!

724
01:12:59,581 --> 01:13:00,805
You don't care about me!

725
01:13:01,005 --> 01:13:03,379
AII you ever wanted
was to sleep with my sister!

726
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,148
Okay, Sebastian, that's enough.

727
01:13:05,820 --> 01:13:07,651
AII right. I'm going.

728
01:13:50,331 --> 01:13:51,730
Charles,

729
01:13:54,702 --> 01:13:57,193
did you give Sebastian money today?

730
01:13:59,440 --> 01:14:00,907
Yes, I did.

731
01:14:03,144 --> 01:14:05,840
Knowing how he was Iikely to spend it?

732
01:14:07,715 --> 01:14:08,909
Yes.

733
01:14:10,585 --> 01:14:12,348
I don't understand.

734
01:14:13,054 --> 01:14:15,989
How could you be so nice
in so many ways,

735
01:14:17,225 --> 01:14:19,989
and then do something
so wantonly cruel?

736
01:14:20,862 --> 01:14:24,889
We all Iiked you so much.
I don't understand how we deserved it.

737
01:14:27,502 --> 01:14:32,371
Do you think it's better
to make him feel Iike a criminal?

738
01:14:34,108 --> 01:14:36,508
Having him watched
every second of the day?

739
01:14:36,777 --> 01:14:39,444
But you deliberately
helped him to drink.

740
01:14:42,050 --> 01:14:44,416
You're the reason he drinks,

741
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,184
not me.

742
01:14:48,489 --> 01:14:50,116
AII I did was

743
01:14:51,693 --> 01:14:53,456
try to give him a Iittle freedom.

744
01:14:53,728 --> 01:14:57,692
No, you just wanted him to Iike you.
You're so desperate to be Iiked.

745
01:14:57,964 --> 01:15:00,393
I think you should Ieave now, Charles.

746
01:16:23,551 --> 01:16:26,486
Hello, there.
Would you Iike me to hold the Iadder?

747
01:16:26,758 --> 01:16:28,044
Yes, thanks.

748
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:35,491
I'm Celia Mulcaster, by the way.

749
01:16:38,065 --> 01:16:39,623
Charles Ryder.

750
01:16:40,868 --> 01:16:45,362
I saw your paintings in the brochure
and thought how charming they Iooked.

751
01:16:48,309 --> 01:16:50,368
No need to Iook so gloomy.

752
01:16:51,112 --> 01:16:54,104
If I had half your talent, I'd be delirious.

753
01:16:56,284 --> 01:16:58,616
You can thank me, if you want.

754
01:17:00,621 --> 01:17:01,986
Thank you.

755
01:17:04,892 --> 01:17:07,554
Would you Iike me
to buy something now?

756
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:29,513
Silent and grave,
and then "pop," mouse is dead.

757
01:17:31,252 --> 01:17:33,482
Charles.
–Lady Marchmain.

758
01:17:35,690 --> 01:17:37,351
Thank you, Father.

759
01:17:39,427 --> 01:17:42,521
I'm so glad your son
didn't die of his injuries.

760
01:17:55,543 --> 01:17:58,273
PIease, sit down.

761
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,643
I'm fine, thank you.

762
01:18:03,251 --> 01:18:04,843
How did you know where I Iived?

763
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:06,819
My driver found you.

764
01:18:07,095 --> 01:18:09,550
The Ryders of Paddington
are Iimited in number.

765
01:18:09,824 --> 01:18:12,791
I hear you have your first exhibition
at the Royal Academy.

766
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,187
Congratulations.

767
01:18:14,662 --> 01:18:16,823
I'm sure you're not here
to ask me how I am.

768
01:18:17,098 --> 01:18:21,267
No. The Iast time we saw each other,
it's true I spoke rather harshly.

769
01:18:22,003 --> 01:18:25,200
I'm not here to apologize.
What I said, I meant.

770
01:18:26,007 --> 01:18:29,204
I took you into my confidence,
and you betrayed me.

771
01:18:30,011 --> 01:18:32,775
I do hope you're not asking me
to agree with you.

772
01:18:33,047 --> 01:18:35,509
I act only as God directs.
–Rubbish.

773
01:18:36,050 --> 01:18:39,315
God's your best invention.
Whatever you want, he does.

774
01:18:39,587 --> 01:18:43,983
I am not here to argue with you.
–Good. I'm glad to hear it.

775
01:18:44,255 --> 01:18:47,050
The reason I called
was to ask you a favor.

776
01:18:50,364 --> 01:18:51,695
A favor?

777
01:18:53,501 --> 01:18:57,335
Sebastian's gone missing.
He's in a house in Morocco.

778
01:18:57,607 --> 01:19:00,806
I'm worried about him.
I need you to bring him back.

779
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:04,505
You banish me from your house,

780
01:19:04,777 --> 01:19:07,911
you poison my friendship
with both your children

781
01:19:08,182 --> 01:19:10,917
and now you expect me
to go begging on your behalf?

782
01:19:11,188 --> 01:19:13,215
There's no one else I can ask.

783
01:19:13,554 --> 01:19:14,814
Even if I were to agree,

784
01:19:15,014 --> 01:19:18,020
what makes you think Sebastian
would take any notice of me?

785
01:19:18,292 --> 01:19:23,428
Because he cared for you more
than he ever cared for anyone else.

786
01:19:28,936 --> 01:19:31,734
AII I ever wanted was to see them safe.

787
01:19:32,707 --> 01:19:34,902
And all they do is hate me.

788
01:19:51,559 --> 01:19:53,493
I'II be at Brideshead.

789
01:19:54,795 --> 01:19:57,059
You may send word to me there.

790
01:19:57,598 --> 01:19:58,895
Driver!

791
01:20:02,069 --> 01:20:03,331
Driver!

792
01:21:56,717 --> 01:21:59,049
I'm Iooking for Sebastian FIyte.

793
01:22:03,557 --> 01:22:05,718
This is his house.

794
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:09,288
Who are you?
–I'm his friend.

795
01:22:11,465 --> 01:22:13,399
In the Iocal hospital.

796
01:22:15,202 --> 01:22:16,999
When you see him,

797
01:22:18,005 --> 01:22:20,200
tell him I'm still here.

798
01:22:26,547 --> 01:22:28,947
Your friend
has got the grippe.

799
01:22:31,018 --> 01:22:33,452
One of his Iungs is full of fluid.

800
01:22:33,888 --> 01:22:37,517
He will recover. But travel with you?
Not a chance.

801
01:22:38,225 --> 01:22:40,659
He's very weak. No resistance.

802
01:22:41,862 --> 01:22:44,695
What do you expect?
He is an alcoholic.

803
01:23:15,629 --> 01:23:17,392
Here is your friend.

804
01:23:34,114 --> 01:23:36,582
What the hell are you doing here?

805
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:38,985
Your mother asked me to come.

806
01:23:39,253 --> 01:23:41,681
She wants me to bring you back home,

807
01:23:42,456 --> 01:23:46,392
but the doctor said
it's out of the question for you to travel.

808
01:23:46,694 --> 01:23:48,821
I wouldn't, even if I could.

809
01:23:49,597 --> 01:23:51,030
I think …

810
01:23:53,500 --> 01:23:55,400
I think she's dying.

811
01:24:04,111 --> 01:24:07,137
Walk with me. I'm meant to exercise.

812
01:24:26,867 --> 01:24:28,858
Did you go to my house?

813
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,967
Did you meet Kurt?

814
01:24:33,107 --> 01:24:34,369
Yes.

815
01:24:36,377 --> 01:24:39,312
He wanted you to know
he was waiting for you.

816
01:24:40,381 --> 01:24:42,747
It's rather a pleasant change,

817
01:24:43,817 --> 01:24:47,412
when all your Iife
you've had people Iooking after you,

818
01:24:47,955 --> 01:24:50,651
to have someone to Iook after, yourself.

819
01:25:05,172 --> 01:25:07,831
I thought you'd want to go back
to Brideshead one day.

820
01:25:08,031 --> 01:25:09,075
Brideshead?

821
01:25:09,376 --> 01:25:10,843
Are you mad?

822
01:25:12,746 --> 01:25:15,340
The place would still be full of her.

823
01:25:17,451 --> 01:25:20,682
I wouldn't go within
a hundred miles of the place.

824
01:25:25,192 --> 01:25:26,716
I need to sit.

825
01:25:41,241 --> 01:25:42,640
I'm sorry.

826
01:25:43,477 --> 01:25:45,001
Whatever for?

827
01:25:55,089 --> 01:25:56,556
Everything.

828
01:25:57,591 --> 01:25:59,115
It's all right.

829
01:26:00,794 --> 01:26:02,056
Truly.

830
01:26:04,865 --> 01:26:06,890
I asked too much of you.

831
01:26:09,536 --> 01:26:11,663
I knew it all along, really.

832
01:26:13,774 --> 01:26:16,538
Only God can give you that sort of Iove.

833
01:26:24,184 --> 01:26:26,175
Come home, Sebastian.

834
01:26:28,489 --> 01:26:30,457
When you're well enough.

835
01:26:31,992 --> 01:26:34,119
Don't finish it Iike this.

836
01:26:37,498 --> 01:26:39,261
This is my Iife now.

837
01:26:41,668 --> 01:26:43,260
I'm happy here.

838
01:26:48,208 --> 01:26:49,732
I miss you.

839
01:26:52,279 --> 01:26:54,474
How sweet of you to say that.

840
01:26:57,217 --> 01:26:58,741
Dear Charles,

841
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:05,383
it was my fault for
bringing you to Brideshead.

842
01:27:10,931 --> 01:27:12,296
Run away.

843
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:17,164
Run far away and don't ever Iook back.

844
01:28:11,158 --> 01:28:12,557
I'm sorry.

845
01:28:40,254 --> 01:28:42,449
You must be so proud of him.

846
01:28:43,023 --> 01:28:45,287
Was he away Iong?
–Two years,

847
01:28:45,492 --> 01:28:47,121
and it doesn't feel Iike a day.

848
01:29:37,044 --> 01:29:38,602
Hello, Charles.

849
01:29:46,086 --> 01:29:48,384
Did you know I was on the boat?

850
01:29:50,324 --> 01:29:53,020
If I said no, you wouldn't believe me.

851
01:29:58,799 --> 01:30:00,562
You're married now.

852
01:30:01,668 --> 01:30:02,760
Yes.

853
01:30:07,975 --> 01:30:11,911
You haven't changed at all.
–Neither have you.

854
01:30:16,883 --> 01:30:19,215
How ridiculous.
–Yes, isn't it?

855
01:30:23,056 --> 01:30:24,956
Tell me this is fate.

856
01:31:49,810 --> 01:31:51,539
What?
–Nothing.

857
01:31:53,013 --> 01:31:54,344
Tell me.

858
01:31:55,148 --> 01:31:57,582
I was thinking about Sebastian.

859
01:31:58,385 --> 01:32:01,411
Mummy died without
ever seeing him again.

860
01:32:05,358 --> 01:32:06,620
I know.

861
01:32:11,231 --> 01:32:13,131
Let's go up on deck.

862
01:32:14,000 --> 01:32:17,026
Are you sure?
–They're all asleep! Come on!

863
01:32:20,574 --> 01:32:21,939
Come on!

864
01:32:33,019 --> 01:32:34,213
Sorry.

865
01:32:38,759 --> 01:32:41,227
So where's Rex?
–I drowned him.

866
01:32:41,962 --> 01:32:43,623
Forgive me, Rex!

867
01:32:57,844 --> 01:32:59,869
Lady Julia, fancy meeting you here.

868
01:33:00,146 --> 01:33:02,608
Mr. Ryder.
–Could I possibly get you a drink?

869
01:33:02,885 --> 01:33:03,910
Dry martini, please.

870
01:33:04,187 --> 01:33:06,282
One dry Martini,
one whiskey with water.

871
01:33:06,559 --> 01:33:08,014
PIease, allow me.

872
01:33:18,064 --> 01:33:19,691
So, why did you marry Rex?

873
01:33:19,968 --> 01:33:22,735
I don't know. Because he wasn't you.

874
01:33:23,236 --> 01:33:26,296
Because he was rich.
–Because he was Catholic.

875
01:33:26,673 --> 01:33:29,506
Because Mummy approved,
God rest her soul.

876
01:33:31,578 --> 01:33:34,479
I thought he was my painted savage.

877
01:33:35,649 --> 01:33:38,482
It turns out he was
thoroughly up to date.

878
01:33:40,754 --> 01:33:41,846
Thank you.

879
01:33:42,122 --> 01:33:44,914
Now, no more talk about Rex.
He's in England.

880
01:33:53,867 --> 01:33:56,802
Do you have children?
–No.

881
01:33:58,305 --> 01:33:59,465
No.

882
01:34:02,943 --> 01:34:06,140
What will you tell your wife?
–Wait until London.

883
01:34:07,814 --> 01:34:11,614
I have a viewing to arrange.
I'II sort it out. It'II be fine.

884
01:34:12,419 --> 01:34:15,411
Where shall we go?
–Somewhere abroad, Iike Daddy.

885
01:34:15,688 --> 01:34:18,355
What about Italy? Capri?
–Antibes.

886
01:34:18,625 --> 01:34:19,714
Seville.
–Verona.

887
01:34:19,914 --> 01:34:21,221
Paris.
–Brideshead.

888
01:34:21,494 --> 01:34:23,194
No!
–Why not?

889
01:34:24,464 --> 01:34:27,524
It's the Ioveliest place on earth.
–I can't go back there.

890
01:34:27,801 --> 01:34:29,398
Not after this.
–Nonsense.

891
01:34:29,675 --> 01:34:32,165
We've nothing to apologize for.
–No.

892
01:34:34,307 --> 01:34:35,865
Besides, Rex is there.

893
01:34:36,142 --> 01:34:38,968
Leave it to me.
I'II settle things with Rex.

894
01:34:40,013 --> 01:34:41,981
I'II settle everything.

895
01:34:45,485 --> 01:34:46,782
Trust me.

896
01:34:48,021 --> 01:34:49,215
I do.

897
01:34:50,190 --> 01:34:52,522
And stop worrying!
–I will.

898
01:35:07,874 --> 01:35:10,866
Good afternoon, ma'am.
Lovely day.

899
01:35:13,880 --> 01:35:15,609
Mr. and Mrs. Ryder.

900
01:35:16,917 --> 01:35:20,648
Look, that's the Duke
and Duchess of CIarence.

901
01:35:21,187 --> 01:35:24,554
They want to buy one!
–How very gracious of them.

902
01:35:26,726 --> 01:35:31,425
Make an effort, Charles.
I've got you the cream of Mayfair.

903
01:35:34,734 --> 01:35:36,429
Mrs. Ryder, good day.

904
01:35:36,703 --> 01:35:40,030
Charles, how charming you Iook.

905
01:35:43,143 --> 01:35:44,405
Anthony.

906
01:35:44,911 --> 01:35:48,674
I heard, quite by chance, at a Iuncheon,
that you were having an exhibition.

907
01:35:48,874 --> 01:35:52,141
So, of course, I dashed impetuously
to the shrine to pay homage.

908
01:35:52,552 --> 01:35:54,452
Where are the pictures?

909
01:35:56,089 --> 01:35:58,182
Let me explain them to you.

910
01:36:09,069 --> 01:36:10,593
This is simply charm.

911
01:36:10,870 --> 01:36:15,164
Simple, creamy, English charm,
playing tigers.

912
01:36:18,111 --> 01:36:20,102
But enough of art.

913
01:36:20,379 --> 01:36:24,344
They tell me you are happy in Iove
and that is everything, isn't it?

914
01:36:24,621 --> 01:36:26,442
Or nearly everything.

915
01:36:27,821 --> 01:36:29,948
Everyone's talking about it.

916
01:36:30,148 --> 01:36:33,515
So, it's Julia now.
And it used to be Sebastian.

917
01:36:34,761 --> 01:36:37,059
Do you think I should warn her?

918
01:36:37,364 --> 01:36:39,298
Warn her about what?

919
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:44,803
How apropos that you'd have
chosen jungles for your canvas.

920
01:36:46,973 --> 01:36:49,771
I always thought you
were the Iamb to be slaughtered,

921
01:36:50,043 --> 01:36:52,676
when all along it is they
who are hunted.

922
01:36:54,314 --> 01:36:58,717
There really is no end to your hunger,
is there, Charles?

923
01:37:17,237 --> 01:37:19,899
Why do I feel so nervous?
Don't be.

924
01:37:25,912 --> 01:37:29,905
Who are all these people?
–Politicians, money men.

925
01:37:30,650 --> 01:37:32,847
Rex thinks there's a war
coming with Hitler.

926
01:37:33,047 --> 01:37:34,582
He wants to do well out of it.

927
01:37:34,782 --> 01:37:37,084
It's all he talks about.
–Hello, Julia.

928
01:37:37,357 --> 01:37:39,318
Hello, Rex.
–Good evening, Rex.

929
01:37:39,591 --> 01:37:41,917
Mr. Ryder,
welcome back to Brideshead.

930
01:37:42,190 --> 01:37:44,555
I hear you're making
quite a name for yourself.

931
01:37:44,828 --> 01:37:48,032
Could I have a word with you?
–Later, I have guests.

932
01:37:54,674 --> 01:37:56,039
It's cold.

933
01:38:02,782 --> 01:38:04,215
Not here!

934
01:38:07,487 --> 01:38:10,388
Sorry.
–Let's go back to London.

935
01:38:10,657 --> 01:38:14,120
Let me settle everything with Rex.
–And then we'II Ieave?

936
01:38:14,794 --> 01:38:17,592
Yes? Charles?
–Yes.

937
01:38:19,299 --> 01:38:21,324
If that's what you want.

938
01:38:33,179 --> 01:38:34,874
Hello, Bridey.

939
01:38:35,143 --> 01:38:37,917
Hello, Julia. Just up from London?
–Yes.

940
01:38:38,685 --> 01:38:40,949
Welcome back to Brideshead, Charles.

941
01:38:41,218 --> 01:38:43,818
How's your family?
–Fine, thank you.

942
01:38:45,425 --> 01:38:48,952
Rex still entertaining?
–He's got business.

943
01:38:52,699 --> 01:38:55,766
I'm sorry he's not here.
I have a Iittle announcement to make.

944
01:38:55,966 --> 01:38:57,569
Well, come on. Out with it.

945
01:38:57,837 --> 01:39:01,164
I'm engaged to be married.
–Congratulations, Bridey.

946
01:39:01,432 --> 01:39:03,801
Well, who is she?

947
01:39:04,069 --> 01:39:06,471
No one you know.
–Is she pretty?

948
01:39:06,980 --> 01:39:10,074
I don't think you could
exactly call her pretty.

949
01:39:10,283 --> 01:39:13,243
"Comely" is the word
I think of in her connection.

950
01:39:13,452 --> 01:39:15,150
She is a big woman.

951
01:39:15,359 --> 01:39:16,984
Fat?
–No, big.

952
01:39:17,690 --> 01:39:20,750
She's called Mrs. Muspratt.
Her Christian name is Beryl.

953
01:39:21,027 --> 01:39:22,954
But, Bridey, where did you find her?

954
01:39:23,231 --> 01:39:26,829
Her Iate husband, Admiral Muspratt,
collected matchboxes.

955
01:39:27,267 --> 01:39:30,668
You're not marrying her
for her matchboxes, are you, Bridey?

956
01:39:30,945 --> 01:39:31,965
No, no.

957
01:39:32,472 --> 01:39:34,772
Matchboxes were Ieft
to Falmouth Town Library.

958
01:39:34,972 --> 01:39:38,137
I'm just holding them for collection.
Why are you Iaughing?

959
01:39:38,745 --> 01:39:41,509
I hope you'II be very happy.
–Thank you.

960
01:39:42,115 --> 01:39:45,482
I think I'm very fortunate.
–You sly, old thing.

961
01:39:45,752 --> 01:39:48,513
When are we going to meet her?
You must bring her here.

962
01:39:48,713 --> 01:39:50,116
I couldn't do that.
–Why not?

963
01:39:50,316 --> 01:39:51,647
Well, you must understand,

964
01:39:51,847 --> 01:39:54,124
Beryl is a woman
of strict Catholic principle,

965
01:39:54,324 --> 01:39:56,958
fortified by the prejudices
of the middle classes.

966
01:39:57,230 --> 01:39:59,555
I couldn't possibly bring her here.

967
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:01,497
I don't understand.

968
01:40:01,768 --> 01:40:03,867
It may be a matter of indifference
to you,

969
01:40:04,067 --> 01:40:06,830
whether or not you choose
to Iive in sin with Charles,

970
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:09,764
but on no account would Beryl
consent to be your guest.

971
01:40:10,210 --> 01:40:12,770
How dare you talk to her
Iike that?

972
01:40:15,014 --> 01:40:17,574
BIoody offensive thing to say!

973
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:20,174
Really, there was nothing
she could object to.

974
01:40:20,374 --> 01:40:22,646
I was merely stating
a fact well known to her.

975
01:40:43,309 --> 01:40:45,869
Take no notice of him, my darling.

976
01:40:48,748 --> 01:40:49,837
So,

977
01:40:51,417 --> 01:40:53,942
got you. Sorry about the delay.

978
01:40:54,988 --> 01:40:56,751
I'II be outside.

979
01:41:08,901 --> 01:41:12,894
The door? Door's made
from all the works of Dickens.

980
01:41:13,172 --> 01:41:16,032
I had it installed especially. Want one?

981
01:41:17,210 --> 01:41:18,768
No, thank you.

982
01:41:23,149 --> 01:41:25,344
I know what you're thinking.

983
01:41:29,622 --> 01:41:32,785
How vulgar can it get?
You wanna know the secret?

984
01:41:37,964 --> 01:41:39,795
I do it on purpose.

985
01:41:40,066 --> 01:41:43,267
It amuses me to offend
their delicate sensibilities.

986
01:41:44,804 --> 01:41:47,272
So, you wanna take my wife off me?

987
01:41:47,543 --> 01:41:50,537
You know she can't marry
a divorce, right?

988
01:41:51,044 --> 01:41:53,945
Against the rules.
–Well, at Ieast she'II be free of you.

989
01:41:54,213 --> 01:41:55,480
She'II never be free.

990
01:41:55,748 --> 01:41:57,809
Don't pretend
you've been faithful to her.

991
01:41:58,009 --> 01:41:59,546
Who said anything about faith?

992
01:41:59,746 --> 01:42:03,282
I bet you'd Iove to get your hands
on the house, though, wouldn't you?

993
01:42:03,556 --> 01:42:06,951
AII those pretty paintings.
AII those pretty views.

994
01:42:07,225 --> 01:42:09,859
Let her go, Rex. You never Ioved her.

995
01:42:10,129 --> 01:42:12,724
The only thing you ever had
in common was religion.

996
01:42:12,924 --> 01:42:15,865
Wrong. When I decided to marry Julia,
I wasn't a Catholic.

997
01:42:16,065 --> 01:42:17,666
I converted before the wedding.

998
01:42:19,238 --> 01:42:21,502
Bet she didn't tell you that.

999
01:42:21,974 --> 01:42:24,772
I guessed.
–Oh, yeah?

1000
01:42:26,045 --> 01:42:27,740
You're the type.

1001
01:42:32,985 --> 01:42:34,543
You people,

1002
01:42:36,189 --> 01:42:37,986
you never Iearn.

1003
01:42:40,226 --> 01:42:43,418
You could have had it all
if you'd been a Iittle more flexible.

1004
01:42:43,618 --> 01:42:44,861
I did what I had to do.

1005
01:42:45,131 --> 01:42:47,692
They want a Catholic,
I'II convert to Catholicism.

1006
01:42:47,892 --> 01:42:48,992
It's a great religion.

1007
01:42:49,192 --> 01:42:51,964
You sin all you want, then you confess.
Problem solved.

1008
01:42:52,164 --> 01:42:54,031
You gotta woo these people.

1009
01:42:54,874 --> 01:42:56,998
This family don't Iive in the real world.

1010
01:42:57,198 --> 01:42:59,934
They're mortgaged up to the hilt.
–Get to the point.

1011
01:43:06,986 --> 01:43:10,285
You want my wife? Make me an offer.

1012
01:43:10,990 --> 01:43:14,892
I'm not just giving her away.
–Don't do this. It's demeaning.

1013
01:43:16,729 --> 01:43:18,526
Try a Iittle harder.

1014
01:43:20,666 --> 01:43:23,566
You're a rich man, Rex,
you've already got what you wanted.

1015
01:43:23,766 --> 01:43:25,870
You can never have enough
of what you want.

1016
01:43:30,243 --> 01:43:31,904
No, you're right.

1017
01:43:32,478 --> 01:43:35,276
You're taking her off my hands.
That's a favor.

1018
01:43:35,548 --> 01:43:37,873
I'II tell you what I'II do.

1019
01:43:39,018 --> 01:43:44,923
You give me a couple of your jungle
pics, and I'II give you an annulment.

1020
01:43:45,195 --> 01:43:47,425
I hear you're worth collecting.

1021
01:43:52,465 --> 01:43:55,923
Come on, Charlie boy, say yes.
You know you want to.

1022
01:43:58,504 --> 01:44:00,529
You don't have to speak.

1023
01:44:03,776 --> 01:44:05,141
Just nod.

1024
01:44:23,563 --> 01:44:25,553
I'II have my driver take me to London.

1025
01:44:25,753 --> 01:44:28,066
He can pick up the paintings
in the morning.

1026
01:44:36,909 --> 01:44:40,606
You know she's mad.
Can't even give you children.

1027
01:44:42,648 --> 01:44:44,548
Lost the only one we had.

1028
01:45:05,037 --> 01:45:06,231
Julia?

1029
01:45:26,325 --> 01:45:28,418
I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

1030
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:32,930
It's just a shock.
–Shh.

1031
01:45:33,165 --> 01:45:35,030
Shh. Don't.

1032
01:45:37,670 --> 01:45:40,332
I've always known, ever since nursery.

1033
01:45:41,941 --> 01:45:45,570
I tried to be good, I really did.
I tried. I married Rex.

1034
01:45:46,679 --> 01:45:49,477
AII through the backgammon
and cigars, I tried.

1035
01:45:49,749 --> 01:45:53,178
But it's not enough. It's never enough.

1036
01:45:55,254 --> 01:45:57,051
God had to punish me.

1037
01:45:58,224 --> 01:46:00,715
So he took my Iittle stillborn …

1038
01:46:01,193 --> 01:46:03,423
My child. My girl.

1039
01:46:04,931 --> 01:46:07,991
With you, I thought I could
really and truly be free.

1040
01:46:08,267 --> 01:46:10,900
But coming back here, it's Iike a thread,

1041
01:46:11,176 --> 01:46:14,997
an invisible thread drawing you back,
inch by inch,

1042
01:46:15,875 --> 01:46:18,810
until all of a sudden,
you're a child again.

1043
01:46:19,478 --> 01:46:21,136
And that voice inside your head,

1044
01:46:21,336 --> 01:46:24,441
the one that Mummy planted
all those years ago in the nursery,

1045
01:46:24,641 --> 01:46:27,309
every night in the nursery,
filling your head with it.

1046
01:46:27,586 --> 01:46:29,681
And the voice is telling you,
whispering,

1047
01:46:29,958 --> 01:46:32,852
"Wicked Iittle Julia,
bad Iittle girl, Iiving in sin."

1048
01:46:33,129 --> 01:46:35,951
And here I am again with you,
Iiving in sin.

1049
01:46:39,098 --> 01:46:41,157
It's over. It's over now.

1050
01:47:01,988 --> 01:47:04,354
Everything set?
–That's everything, sir.

1051
01:47:04,623 --> 01:47:07,085
Thank you, Wilcox.
–Best of Iuck, sir.

1052
01:47:31,984 --> 01:47:33,417
Who's that?

1053
01:47:37,890 --> 01:47:40,654
Go back. Turn around.
I have to go back.

1054
01:47:43,729 --> 01:47:46,027
Staff, immediately!
–Yes, sir.

1055
01:47:47,533 --> 01:47:49,467
Come on, quickly now!

1056
01:47:53,439 --> 01:47:55,236
I'II help with that.

1057
01:47:56,075 --> 01:47:57,542
Come on, hurry!
Yes, sir.

1058
01:47:57,810 --> 01:47:59,275
Shall I help, Tompkins?
Hurry!

1059
01:47:59,475 --> 01:48:02,378
The sedan chair.
Right, very gently. Very gently.

1060
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:06,484
Hurry.
Get a move with the chair.

1061
01:48:06,752 --> 01:48:08,543
Come along, come along.

1062
01:48:09,422 --> 01:48:11,322
Somebody got the rug?

1063
01:48:13,726 --> 01:48:15,159
Up. Gently.

1064
01:48:15,528 --> 01:48:19,225
Clear the stairs, please.
Could I have the medical bag?

1065
01:48:21,500 --> 01:48:24,025
Father!
–Dear Julia.

1066
01:48:24,537 --> 01:48:26,562
Come on, please. Come on!

1067
01:48:35,114 --> 01:48:36,706
I'm sorry, I was to call,

1068
01:48:36,982 --> 01:48:39,910
but we have been traveling
without a stop for three days.

1069
01:48:40,185 --> 01:48:42,610
It was Cordelia,
she was visiting us in Venice …

1070
01:48:42,810 --> 01:48:44,580
What happened?
We want the bed ready

1071
01:48:44,780 --> 01:48:45,884
as soon as possible.

1072
01:48:46,084 --> 01:48:49,050
His heart. Some Iong word at the heart.

1073
01:48:49,562 --> 01:48:50,859
Hurry up.

1074
01:48:51,931 --> 01:48:53,364
He's dying.

1075
01:48:54,200 --> 01:48:56,168
He has come home to die.

1076
01:49:00,706 --> 01:49:02,767
Come on, everybody, that's it.
Chop-chop.

1077
01:49:02,967 --> 01:49:04,030
Come along.

1078
01:49:04,230 --> 01:49:06,809
We must get Lord Marchmain
to the great dining room.

1079
01:49:15,020 --> 01:49:16,510
Thank you.

1080
01:49:23,929 --> 01:49:25,487
He's sleeping.

1081
01:49:27,333 --> 01:49:29,494
Do you think we should
Iet Sebastian know?

1082
01:49:29,768 --> 01:49:31,934
You could, but I doubt he'd come.

1083
01:49:32,208 --> 01:49:35,565
The Iast I heard of him,
he was still struggling rather.

1084
01:49:35,875 --> 01:49:39,174
The monks have him as a porter
in the hospital in Morocco.

1085
01:49:39,445 --> 01:49:41,008
He seems to Iike it.

1086
01:49:41,279 --> 01:49:44,776
I think they've rather taken him
under their wing, dear old thing.

1087
01:49:45,047 --> 01:49:48,342
Still, salvation of a sort.

1088
01:49:50,656 --> 01:49:53,352
Bridey, you need to call for a priest.

1089
01:49:54,193 --> 01:49:57,527
I'II have a word with Father Mackay
about dropping in this evening.

1090
01:49:57,727 --> 01:49:59,791
Julia, your father doesn't want a priest.

1091
01:50:00,132 --> 01:50:02,457
AII he wants is to die in his old home.

1092
01:50:02,798 --> 01:50:07,837
Our father's soul, all sinners' souls,
face mortal danger.

1093
01:50:08,841 --> 01:50:12,072
It is our duty as Catholics
to see that we do all in our power

1094
01:50:12,344 --> 01:50:15,409
to save those we Iove from themselves.

1095
01:50:57,590 --> 01:50:59,182
Hateful woman.

1096
01:51:00,359 --> 01:51:02,156
She wants me dead.

1097
01:51:04,830 --> 01:51:06,491
What about you?

1098
01:51:07,533 --> 01:51:10,434
Do you want me dead?
–No.

1099
01:51:19,645 --> 01:51:22,512
You know the family
are sending for a priest.

1100
01:51:22,781 --> 01:51:26,108
They seem determined
to drag God into it.

1101
01:51:27,286 --> 01:51:29,311
Why should you care?

1102
01:51:30,022 --> 01:51:32,047
You don't believe in God.

1103
01:51:33,259 --> 01:51:35,124
You said so yourself.

1104
01:51:37,162 --> 01:51:39,926
Have you suddenly
become my conscience?

1105
01:51:42,067 --> 01:51:45,002
I've already seen Sebastian
ruined by God.

1106
01:51:45,270 --> 01:51:49,769
I don't see why I should watch it
happen again with your daughter.

1107
01:51:51,677 --> 01:51:54,009
How very caring of you.

1108
01:51:55,314 --> 01:51:57,339
You forget, I was there.

1109
01:51:58,417 --> 01:52:01,580
I watched that woman crucify my son,

1110
01:52:01,987 --> 01:52:05,445
Iittle by Iittle, and I was silent.

1111
01:52:07,526 --> 01:52:10,017
What does that say about me?

1112
01:52:10,295 --> 01:52:12,427
You're not responsible
for what she did.

1113
01:52:12,705 --> 01:52:16,264
But are we not also
our brother's keeper?

1114
01:52:17,603 --> 01:52:20,629
You, Charles, and me?

1115
01:52:24,043 --> 01:52:26,011
I Iet Sebastian down.

1116
01:52:28,948 --> 01:52:30,916
I Iet everyone down.

1117
01:52:35,521 --> 01:52:37,079
This way, sir.

1118
01:52:47,299 --> 01:52:48,891
Dear, no, that's too many!

1119
01:52:49,168 --> 01:52:51,061
Papa …
–Your father needs to rest!

1120
01:52:51,336 --> 01:52:54,031
Get him away.
–I've brought Father Mackay to see you.

1121
01:52:54,231 --> 01:52:57,432
Get him away! Get him away!
–Out!

1122
01:52:57,709 --> 01:53:00,034
Everybody out! Out! Out!

1123
01:53:01,380 --> 01:53:05,612
I'm so sorry, Father.
–Not at all. Give him time.

1124
01:53:05,884 --> 01:53:08,847
I've known worse cases
make beautiful deaths.

1125
01:53:13,092 --> 01:53:15,856
What were you talking
to my father about?

1126
01:53:19,965 --> 01:53:21,956
He doesn't want a priest.

1127
01:53:24,169 --> 01:53:25,796
PIease, Charles.

1128
01:53:26,205 --> 01:53:29,470
PIease don't interfere with matters
that don't concern you.

1129
01:53:29,741 --> 01:53:30,872
Julia …

1130
01:53:35,014 --> 01:53:36,948
Let's get out of here.

1131
01:53:37,219 --> 01:53:38,779
We'II go to Italy.

1132
01:53:40,085 --> 01:53:43,248
Capri.
–I can't Ieave now, my father's dying.

1133
01:53:44,656 --> 01:53:48,148
When this is over,
I can make you happy.

1134
01:54:03,175 --> 01:54:06,770
Why should I believe you?
–Believe me.

1135
01:54:07,346 --> 01:54:09,507
You just bought me from Rex.

1136
01:54:13,919 --> 01:54:15,944
What are you talking about?

1137
01:54:16,221 --> 01:54:18,751
According to you,
I'm worth two pictures.

1138
01:54:21,560 --> 01:54:24,120
I thought I'd fetch at Ieast three.

1139
01:54:26,298 --> 01:54:28,289
Don't be ridiculous.

1140
01:54:30,769 --> 01:54:33,670
That was Rex.
–You agreed to it, Charles.

1141
01:54:34,373 --> 01:54:36,568
I had no choice!
–You agreed!

1142
01:54:36,842 --> 01:54:38,766
I thought I was doing the right thing.

1143
01:54:38,966 --> 01:54:40,866
I thought I was doing what you wanted.

1144
01:54:41,066 --> 01:54:44,041
No, you thought you were getting me
and the house, together.

1145
01:54:44,241 --> 01:54:47,314
Is that really what you think?
–You tell me. PIease, tell me.

1146
01:54:47,514 --> 01:54:49,513
What does Charles Ryder really want?

1147
01:55:10,075 --> 01:55:14,444
Can you imagine what it was Iike
for me to be invited into Brideshead?

1148
01:55:16,849 --> 01:55:18,180
Me,

1149
01:55:19,952 --> 01:55:21,715
Charles Ryder,

1150
01:55:22,855 --> 01:55:26,791
"the painter from Paddington,"
as your mother so sweetly put it.

1151
01:55:27,826 --> 01:55:30,693
There was no humiliation
I would not have endured

1152
01:55:30,962 --> 01:55:33,094
just to be part of that dream.

1153
01:55:34,466 --> 01:55:38,926
And your mother, that woman is more
alive now than she ever was.

1154
01:55:39,195 --> 01:55:43,668
She's in every brick,
every stone, every slate.

1155
01:55:48,547 --> 01:55:50,378
Sebastian was right.

1156
01:55:58,657 --> 01:56:00,648
We should run away.

1157
01:56:03,695 --> 01:56:07,392
Why did you bring me here?
–We can still Ieave.

1158
01:56:54,379 --> 01:56:57,007
Bridey …
–Don't interfere, Charles.

1159
01:57:23,575 --> 01:57:28,239
Now, try and remember your sins
and tell God you're sorry.

1160
01:57:28,780 --> 01:57:31,476
I'm going to give you absolution now.

1161
01:57:31,750 --> 01:57:33,347
And while I'm giving it,

1162
01:57:33,621 --> 01:57:36,410
I want you to tell God you're sorry
you offended him,

1163
01:57:36,684 --> 01:57:39,980
and then I want you
to make a sign, if you can.

1164
01:57:51,403 --> 01:57:53,394
Amen.
–Amen.

1165
01:58:22,768 --> 01:58:23,962
Amen.

1166
01:58:39,718 --> 01:58:43,848
PIease, God,
please, if you're there, forgive him.

1167
01:58:45,057 --> 01:58:49,221
Forgive me. Oh, God, forgive me.
Let him have a sign.

1168
02:00:31,530 --> 02:00:34,226
Sebastian used to Ioathe this painting.

1169
02:00:36,802 --> 02:00:39,737
Daddy gave it to Mummy
as a wedding present.

1170
02:00:43,442 --> 02:00:44,704
Tell me.

1171
02:00:49,648 --> 02:00:53,106
I wanted too much.

1172
02:00:55,687 --> 02:00:57,450
It's nobody's fault.

1173
02:00:57,923 --> 02:01:01,086
But you're not coming with me.

1174
02:01:06,598 --> 02:01:09,294
I can't shut myself off from His mercy.

1175
02:01:12,237 --> 02:01:14,262
Can you understand that?

1176
02:01:17,542 --> 02:01:20,670
I don't want to make it easier for you.

1177
02:01:28,086 --> 02:01:31,112
I hope your heart

1178
02:01:33,058 --> 02:01:34,423
breaks.

1179
02:01:41,533 --> 02:01:43,330
But I do understand.

1180
02:01:49,207 --> 02:01:51,038
I have to Iet you go.

1181
02:03:10,622 --> 02:03:14,319
<i>Whether by fate or the
divine ironies of some higher power,</i>

1182
02:03:15,827 --> 02:03:19,558
<i>I find myself returned once more
to Brideshead.</i>

1183
02:03:19,831 --> 02:03:21,155
Let it go.

1184
02:03:33,111 --> 02:03:35,978
<i>Did I want too much?</i>

1185
02:03:38,883 --> 02:03:40,407
Get him out of my sight!

1186
02:03:40,680 --> 02:03:44,785
<i>Did my own hunger blind me to
the ties that bound them to their faith?</i>

1187
02:03:47,559 --> 02:03:52,758
<i>Am I only now, shadowed by war,
all moorings gone,</i>

1188
02:03:55,467 --> 02:03:57,799
<i>alone enough to see the light?</i>

1189
02:04:05,877 --> 02:04:07,401
Worst place we've struck yet.

1190
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:09,103
No facilities, no amenities,

1191
02:04:09,381 --> 02:04:11,913
and the nearest village
is a five-mile walk.

1192
02:04:12,191 --> 02:04:14,515
Mind you, there's a rumor
of a big push coming.

1193
02:04:14,793 --> 02:04:16,850
They'II be shipping
us off to France soon.

1194
02:04:17,128 --> 02:04:18,313
Yes, very soon.

1195
02:04:19,891 --> 02:04:22,291
Where are the family now?
Does anyone know?

1196
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:25,329
Some Lady FIyte Iives
on her own here, normally.

1197
02:04:25,598 --> 02:04:27,556
She's overseas
with the women's service.

1198
02:04:27,825 --> 02:04:31,263
Her elder brother died in the BIitz.
They're all Roman Catholic.

1199
02:04:31,870 --> 02:04:36,432
I take it you're not religious, Hooper.
–Me? God, no. Can't see the point in it.

1200
02:04:36,708 --> 02:04:39,204
You're born, you Iive, then you die.

1201
02:04:42,213 --> 02:04:44,476
Do you have any hopes
for the future, Hooper?

1202
02:04:44,676 --> 02:04:46,074
Hopes? Oh, aye, plenty.

1203
02:04:46,718 --> 02:04:50,848
It's our time now. You watch.
The old ways, all this, they're gone.

1204
02:04:51,322 --> 02:04:54,587
Future belongs to us,
so Iong as we don't get shot.

1205
02:04:56,061 --> 02:04:57,358
How about you, sir?

1206
02:04:57,629 --> 02:04:59,594
You got someone
special waiting for you?

1207
02:04:59,794 --> 02:05:01,093
Me? No.

1208
02:05:02,200 --> 02:05:05,328
I've Ioved and Iost
for more than one Iifetime.

1209
02:05:07,005 --> 02:05:09,200
Would you Iike me
to drive you back, sir?

1210
02:05:09,474 --> 02:05:12,072
No, not yet. Carry on, Hooper.

1211
02:05:12,510 --> 02:05:14,102
Very good, sir.

1212
02:05:23,655 --> 02:05:25,452
Sergeant!
