1
00:01:02,608 --> 00:01:03,961
Let's go!

2
00:01:08,328 --> 00:01:10,239
- I'm open, I'm open.
- I don't see it!

3
00:01:10,328 --> 00:01:12,558
- Take your time!
- Run!

4
00:01:12,648 --> 00:01:14,604
- Run!
- Go, go!

5
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:17,566
- Let's go!
- Defence! Defence!

6
00:01:17,648 --> 00:01:18,717
Come on, man!

7
00:01:18,808 --> 00:01:21,083
- Hustle, hustle!
- Control that ball!

8
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:23,557
- Bolton! I'm open!
- Set it up! Let's go!

9
00:01:23,648 --> 00:01:26,003
All right, let's go!
Let's move! Let's move!

10
00:01:26,088 --> 00:01:28,807
- Watch the run in.
- Watch the back door!

11
00:01:28,888 --> 00:01:30,082
Get it!

12
00:01:31,928 --> 00:01:33,805
That concludes the first half of play

13
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,482
in our final game,
with the West High Knights

14
00:01:36,648 --> 00:01:40,402
leading defending champion
East High Wildcats 47 - 26.

15
00:01:40,488 --> 00:01:42,444
Sixteen minutes remain in the game.

16
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:06,600
All right! No more X's and O's. OK?

17
00:02:06,688 --> 00:02:10,442
Forget about the scoreboard
because here's a number that matters.

18
00:02:10,528 --> 00:02:11,517
Sixteen.

19
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:15,157
There's 16 minutes
left in this game, guys.

20
00:02:15,248 --> 00:02:18,320
There's only 16 minutes
left in the season.

21
00:02:18,408 --> 00:02:21,878
And for the seniors
on this squad... guys...

22
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:27,640
...you've only got 16 minutes
left in a Wildcat uniform.

23
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:31,007
So make them count.

24
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:35,720
Sixteen minutes to be a team.

25
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,203
Captains!

26
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:44,917
All right.

27
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:47,362
Hey, guys.

28
00:02:48,808 --> 00:02:50,799
Now, you heard Coach.

29
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:53,197
We're all gonna remember
the next 16 minutes

30
00:02:53,368 --> 00:02:55,484
for a long time
after we leave East High.

31
00:02:56,848 --> 00:02:58,247
So it's now or never.

32
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:01,397
Chad.

33
00:03:04,288 --> 00:03:06,085
- What team?
- Wildcats!

34
00:03:06,248 --> 00:03:07,806
- What team?
- Wildcats!

35
00:03:07,888 --> 00:03:10,038
- What team?
- Wildcats!

36
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:17,963
Sixteen, 16, 16 minutes left
Better get it done

37
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:22,326
Sixteen, 16, 16 more minutes
Get ready, game on!

38
00:03:22,408 --> 00:03:26,560
Sixteen, 16, 16 minutes left
Running out of time

39
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:30,197
Sixteen, 16, 16 more minutes
And it's on the line

40
00:03:30,368 --> 00:03:34,202
Sixteen, 16, 16 minutes left
Got to get it done

41
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:37,838
Sixteen, 16, 16 more minutes
till we're number one!

42
00:03:37,928 --> 00:03:41,079
W-l-L-D Wildcats!

43
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:42,567
Huddle up! Let's go!

44
00:03:42,768 --> 00:03:46,363
W-l-L-D Wildcats!
Come on, come on

45
00:03:47,248 --> 00:03:48,363
Ready?

46
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:50,363
Break!

47
00:03:50,448 --> 00:03:53,804
W-l-L-D Wildcats!
Now's the time

48
00:03:54,768 --> 00:03:58,124
Got to get it inside, down low
In the paint, now shoot

49
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,197
Score!

50
00:03:59,288 --> 00:04:01,119
- Gotta work together
- Defence!

51
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:02,357
Give me the ball

52
00:04:02,448 --> 00:04:05,406
Fast break, keep the ball in control
Let it fly from downtown

53
00:04:05,568 --> 00:04:06,717
Three more

54
00:04:06,888 --> 00:04:08,958
- Show them we can do better
- No way!

55
00:04:09,408 --> 00:04:10,682
Come on, boys!

56
00:04:10,848 --> 00:04:14,921
The way we play tonight
is what we leave behind

57
00:04:15,008 --> 00:04:18,683
It all comes down to right now
It's up to us

58
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:21,441
- Let's go!
- So what are we gonna be

59
00:04:21,528 --> 00:04:23,007
T-E-A-M
Team!

60
00:04:23,088 --> 00:04:26,205
Gotta work it out, turn it on

61
00:04:26,288 --> 00:04:28,244
This is the last time to get it right

62
00:04:28,328 --> 00:04:30,523
This is the last chance
to make it our night

63
00:04:30,608 --> 00:04:32,405
We got to show what we're all about

64
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:34,081
- Work together
- Time out!

65
00:04:34,248 --> 00:04:38,241
This is the last chance to make our mark
History will know who we are

66
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:42,401
This is the last game so make it count
It's now or never

67
00:04:45,168 --> 00:04:47,398
- Hey! That's a foul!
- Oh, dear.

68
00:04:49,728 --> 00:04:50,763
You OK?

69
00:04:51,768 --> 00:04:52,803
Come on, Troy!

70
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:57,124
Let's go, buddy!

71
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:01,008
Troy

72
00:05:01,088 --> 00:05:04,080
Right now I can hardly breathe

73
00:05:04,168 --> 00:05:08,719
You can do it, just know that I believe

74
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,641
And that's all I really need

75
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:13,684
- Then come on
- Make me strong

76
00:05:13,768 --> 00:05:16,487
It's time to turn it up
Game on!

77
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:20,038
Wildcats gonna tear it up
Go, Wildcats, yeah, we're number one

78
00:05:20,128 --> 00:05:21,925
Hey, Wildcats, we're champions

79
00:05:22,008 --> 00:05:24,078
Go, go, go, go, go, go
Game on

80
00:05:25,328 --> 00:05:26,841
Foul!

81
00:05:26,928 --> 00:05:28,407
- Yeah!
- All right!

82
00:05:28,488 --> 00:05:30,080
- What?
- Yeah!

83
00:05:30,168 --> 00:05:32,159
Let me hear you say
Hey, hey, hey, yeah

84
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:38,043
I'm tripled-teamed.
I can't get a shot off.

85
00:05:38,128 --> 00:05:40,881
- What do you want to do?
- Let's put in Rocket Man.

86
00:05:40,968 --> 00:05:42,481
Rocket Man?

87
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:44,957
- Troy, you're two points away from...
- I know.

88
00:05:45,048 --> 00:05:47,642
- Just get me the ball.
- OK.

89
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:50,288
Rocket Man! Come on!
Come on, Rocket Man! You're in!

90
00:05:50,368 --> 00:05:51,357
- Get in here!
- Go!

91
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:52,437
- Let's go!
- Move!

92
00:05:52,528 --> 00:05:53,881
Go, go, go! Move!

93
00:05:54,528 --> 00:05:56,200
Yeah! Oh, yeah!

94
00:05:56,328 --> 00:06:00,446
Calm down, OK?
All right, keep your eyes on me.

95
00:06:00,528 --> 00:06:03,042
- Game on!
- This is the last time to get it right

96
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:05,198
This is the last chance
to make it our night

97
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:09,077
We gotta show what we're all about
Team! Work together

98
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:13,400
This is the last chance to make our mark
History will know who we are

99
00:06:13,488 --> 00:06:16,798
This is the last game so make it count
It's now or never

100
00:06:18,288 --> 00:06:19,801
Come on!

101
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:24,163
Shoot it!

102
00:06:30,928 --> 00:06:31,963
Yes!

103
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:35,887
We won, dude! We won! You OK?

104
00:06:45,928 --> 00:06:47,998
That's what I'm talking about. Yeah!

105
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:55,243
I'm pushing.

106
00:06:55,328 --> 00:06:57,159
- You better be.
- I'm pushing!

107
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:59,443
- Push harder!
- Chad, tree!

108
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,357
Home sweet home.

109
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:10,725
- I'm saving for a new fuel pump.
- Save faster.

110
00:07:19,088 --> 00:07:20,441
Hey, turn it up, Kels.

111
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:23,686
- How you doing, girl?
- I'm good!

112
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:25,167
- Great comeback!
- Thanks.

113
00:07:25,248 --> 00:07:27,557
- Watch that tail. It's dangerous.
- You know it!

114
00:07:27,648 --> 00:07:30,845
- Amazing! We won!
- I didn't think they'd come back.

115
00:07:30,928 --> 00:07:31,917
Hey!

116
00:07:32,008 --> 00:07:34,647
- Congratulations!
- Thanks. Can I fix you a plate?

117
00:07:34,728 --> 00:07:37,242
- I want one of everything!
- Are we celebrating?

118
00:07:37,328 --> 00:07:38,477
What's up, Hoops?

119
00:07:38,568 --> 00:07:40,763
- Back-to-back champions!
- Yeah, thanks.

120
00:07:40,848 --> 00:07:43,123
Coach, got a couple
of empty lockers at U of A?

121
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,323
Hopefully not for long.

122
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:46,638
Charlie Danforth
will suit up next season.

123
00:07:46,728 --> 00:07:48,161
Front row seat will be fine.

124
00:07:48,248 --> 00:07:52,036
That teamwork I saw tonight, that
assist where you gave up the final shot,

125
00:07:52,128 --> 00:07:54,358
that's the kind of players
I'm looking for.

126
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:56,837
We're going to see you
in Redhawk uniforms?

127
00:07:56,928 --> 00:07:58,600
- Done deal.
- Amen to that.

128
00:07:58,688 --> 00:08:00,246
- Go have some fun.
- OK.

129
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:02,637
- Congratulations, Troy!
- Hey! Thanks.

130
00:08:02,728 --> 00:08:03,763
- Yo!
- Hey, dude!

131
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:04,997
Sweet game!

132
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:08,683
Hey, Troy. Great house, bro.
Your room is way cool.

133
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:11,202
Thanks, man. You were in my room?

134
00:08:11,288 --> 00:08:14,121
Well, yeah. I just took a picture. Look.

135
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,722
- I'm doing mine the same way.
- Great.

136
00:08:16,808 --> 00:08:20,005
We should hang out tonight.
Get to know each other or something.

137
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:23,398
I just gotta grab the championship
trophy I left it in my truck.

138
00:08:23,488 --> 00:08:25,240
- Don't sweat it! I'm on it!
- OK.

139
00:08:28,248 --> 00:08:29,317
Hi!

140
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:42,680
So, another top-secret hiding place?

141
00:08:43,848 --> 00:08:45,839
You're the second girl
I've had up here.

142
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:50,165
The first was my mom.

143
00:08:50,248 --> 00:08:52,125
She only climbed up here to get me down.

144
00:08:53,688 --> 00:08:57,158
Well, I'm honoured.
This place is so cool.

145
00:08:58,368 --> 00:09:00,006
Me and my dad built it.

146
00:09:02,728 --> 00:09:04,639
Is that the coach
from U of A down there?

147
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:08,164
- Yeah. He's at my house.
- Yeah.

148
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,647
Crazy.

149
00:09:09,728 --> 00:09:11,923
I bet he's already got
your name on a locker.

150
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:17,685
It's always been my dad's dream. Now
I'm going to end up at his alma mater.

151
00:09:20,368 --> 00:09:21,596
Did I just say that?

152
00:09:24,408 --> 00:09:28,481
My mom and I have been talking about
Stanford pretty much since I was born.

153
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,799
And you're already in. That's so cool.

154
00:09:34,088 --> 00:09:37,444
Except she won't stop talking about it.
It's embarrassing.

155
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:39,678
Come on. She's proud of you.

156
00:09:41,728 --> 00:09:43,047
I'm proud of you.

157
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:48,086
The thing about Stanford
is it's a thousand and fifty...

158
00:09:48,168 --> 00:09:50,079
...fifty-three miles from here.

159
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:53,362
I know.

160
00:09:57,608 --> 00:10:00,964
It suddenly seems like the rest
of the school year is coming so fast.

161
00:10:01,048 --> 00:10:03,846
Yeah. I wish it would all just stop.

162
00:10:06,408 --> 00:10:08,000
At least just slow down.

163
00:10:17,088 --> 00:10:20,967
Can you imagine
what would happen

164
00:10:21,128 --> 00:10:23,688
If we could have any dream?

165
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:29,247
I'd wish this moment
was ours to own it

166
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:31,762
And that it would never leave

167
00:10:32,768 --> 00:10:35,487
Then I would thank that star

168
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:38,560
That made our wish come true

169
00:10:38,728 --> 00:10:40,923
Oh, yeah

170
00:10:41,008 --> 00:10:44,205
'Cause he knows that where you are

171
00:10:44,288 --> 00:10:48,042
Is where I should be too

172
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:53,361
Right here

173
00:10:54,808 --> 00:10:57,880
Right now

174
00:10:57,968 --> 00:11:00,323
- Right now
- I'm looking at you

175
00:11:00,408 --> 00:11:03,047
And my heart loves the view

176
00:11:03,128 --> 00:11:07,280
- 'Cause you mean everything
- Everything

177
00:11:07,368 --> 00:11:10,360
Right here

178
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:13,997
I promise you somehow

179
00:11:14,088 --> 00:11:15,806
Somehow we're gonna

180
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:20,120
Tomorrow can wait
for some other day to be

181
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:24,520
To be
But right now there's you and me

182
00:11:25,448 --> 00:11:28,167
Oh, we know it's coming

183
00:11:28,248 --> 00:11:30,239
And it's coming fast

184
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:33,081
It's always you and me

185
00:11:33,728 --> 00:11:36,845
So let's make every second last

186
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:41,077
Make it last

187
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,636
'Cause right here

188
00:11:44,888 --> 00:11:47,800
Right now

189
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:50,759
Yeah, I'm looking at you

190
00:11:50,848 --> 00:11:53,203
And my heart loves the view

191
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:56,246
'Cause you mean everything

192
00:11:57,608 --> 00:12:00,486
Right here

193
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:04,277
I promise you somehow

194
00:12:05,488 --> 00:12:07,479
That tomorrow can wait

195
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:10,366
For some other day to be

196
00:12:10,448 --> 00:12:15,203
To be
But right now there's you and me

197
00:12:15,288 --> 00:12:18,598
- You and me
- You and me

198
00:12:18,688 --> 00:12:20,007
You and me

199
00:12:20,088 --> 00:12:21,521
But right now there's

200
00:12:21,608 --> 00:12:26,682
You and me

201
00:12:36,608 --> 00:12:39,168
Is this a pirate's wheel?

202
00:12:39,248 --> 00:12:40,647
No.

203
00:12:43,488 --> 00:12:44,762
Very cute.

204
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,520
I haven't played
with Robo-Rob since third grade.

205
00:12:46,608 --> 00:12:49,566
- I'm Robo-Rob. I am...
- Don't break him. Don't break him.

206
00:12:53,008 --> 00:12:54,964
- That's Chad's.
- Sure it is.

207
00:12:57,608 --> 00:13:00,361
Now it's just like kindergarten.

208
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:02,564
Troy? You have guests.

209
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,561
Don't make me come up there
and get you again. Hi, Gabriella.

210
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:10,277
We'll be right down, Mom.

211
00:13:13,008 --> 00:13:15,397
She really will come up here
if we don't go down.

212
00:13:15,488 --> 00:13:17,206
Oh, OK.

213
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:30,239
Right there, right there. OK, come on
through. Come on. There you go.

214
00:13:54,648 --> 00:13:55,637
Wow.

215
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:06,081
Hey, Troy.

216
00:14:06,168 --> 00:14:08,159
So, when's the big game?

217
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:10,443
Yesterday.

218
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:13,840
Oh, well. Good luck.

219
00:14:16,248 --> 00:14:18,284
- Wow.
- She's so sweet.

220
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,438
What are you? I mean, who are you?

221
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:50,725
Good morning, Ms Evans.
I'm Tiara Gold.

222
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:52,719
I transferred
to East High from London

223
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,959
and I noticed on the board you're
in need of a personal assistant.

224
00:14:56,888 --> 00:14:58,799
Yeah, with finals, prom, graduation,

225
00:14:58,888 --> 00:15:01,846
I need someone tracking
my appointments and assignments.

226
00:15:01,928 --> 00:15:05,238
Most important, I need someone
to run lines for the musical.

227
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:09,879
- That's a theatre term for...
- Learning your role. I understand.

228
00:15:09,968 --> 00:15:12,528
It's best to keep
science and math books together,

229
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:14,963
since those are
first lessons of the day.

230
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,800
How do you know my schedule?

231
00:15:16,888 --> 00:15:19,880
I took the liberty of checking,
simply to make certain

232
00:15:19,968 --> 00:15:24,007
I'd have your non-fat, no-foam,
soy latte ready for free period.

233
00:15:24,088 --> 00:15:26,318
- One packet of sweetener?
- Organic.

234
00:15:30,128 --> 00:15:34,246
L'll e-mail you my wardrobe choices each
morning so that our outfits won't clash.

235
00:15:34,328 --> 00:15:36,683
If you own any orange, get rid of it.

236
00:15:39,448 --> 00:15:41,757
By the way, like the accent.

237
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:44,203
It's... sweet.

238
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:52,676
Troy, my brother.
Can I have your gym locker?

239
00:15:53,648 --> 00:15:55,923
- What?
- Like starting next week.

240
00:15:56,008 --> 00:16:00,126
L'll be running the team next season
and it'll help me out with the guys.

241
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,439
- Yeah, why didn't I think of that?
- I don't know.

242
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:06,486
Tardy again. Later, bro!

243
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:09,366
Are you serious?

244
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:11,359
What about her... Hey.

245
00:16:14,088 --> 00:16:16,807
All right, everyone. Settle down.

246
00:16:16,888 --> 00:16:20,437
I know we are all still excited
about our Wildcats'

247
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:24,362
- top-to-bottom championships.
- That would be "back-to-back".

248
00:16:24,448 --> 00:16:27,884
Whatever the case, it was a grand slam.
Well done!

249
00:16:27,968 --> 00:16:31,244
And our student body president
and co-editor of the yearbook,

250
00:16:31,328 --> 00:16:34,126
Taylor McKessie,
has important announcements.

251
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:37,996
Senior trip committee meets tomorrow
and reports Thursday to prom committee,

252
00:16:38,088 --> 00:16:40,648
headed by Martha.
Pick up your tickets from her.

253
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:44,004
This year's theme is "The Last Waltz".

254
00:16:44,168 --> 00:16:45,999
But don't be last to pick up tickets.

255
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,842
Graduation committee convenes Monday.
Picture deadline is Thursday

256
00:16:49,928 --> 00:16:53,398
and finals study groups alternate
with all of the above. Questions?

257
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:55,797
What's the lunch special
in the cafeteria?

258
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:59,722
New York deli. Anyone else?

259
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:05,607
Moving on. Ms Sharpay Evans,
four-term president of the drama club,

260
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:07,360
spring musicale report.

261
00:17:07,448 --> 00:17:10,599
Well, with prom, finals,
everyone is so busy.

262
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:13,521
I was thinking
I'd select something modest.

263
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:15,838
Perhaps even a one-woman show.

264
00:17:19,008 --> 00:17:21,806
A little light on the sign-ups, Kelsi?

265
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:24,846
No. We're actually doing pretty well.

266
00:17:26,488 --> 00:17:29,958
Well, well, well.
Almost the entire homeroom.

267
00:17:31,688 --> 00:17:33,440
How inspiring!

268
00:17:33,528 --> 00:17:37,806
I will happily see all of you
at free period to discuss the show

269
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:41,563
and to make
a very special announcement.

270
00:17:56,248 --> 00:18:00,002
L'll be retaking my finals two or three
times. I'm moving into the library.

271
00:18:00,088 --> 00:18:01,806
I'm working on my truck every day.

272
00:18:01,888 --> 00:18:04,277
I've got five recipes
for Family Science final.

273
00:18:04,368 --> 00:18:06,199
We've got a yearbook to edit, so no.

274
00:18:06,288 --> 00:18:10,247
Sorry! Jeez. I thought since it was the
last show, everyone would want to do it.

275
00:18:10,328 --> 00:18:12,603
- You're wrong.
- We just don't have time.

276
00:18:13,568 --> 00:18:17,925
Hey. Hey, you guys, listen up.
Kelsi's right. We should do this.

277
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:20,647
This is our last chance
to do something together.

278
00:18:20,728 --> 00:18:23,117
All of us. Something really fun.

279
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:24,687
Oh, yippee.

280
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:27,525
So, what do you say, Wildcats?

281
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:30,365
No, I still don't think
it's a good idea.

282
00:18:30,448 --> 00:18:33,679
- Guys, come on! It's our senior year!
- Troy.

283
00:18:35,808 --> 00:18:39,198
We're all in this together.
This is our senior year.

284
00:18:39,288 --> 00:18:40,721
I'm in.

285
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:43,402
What?

286
00:18:43,488 --> 00:18:45,160
- It will be fun.
- Yes!

287
00:18:45,448 --> 00:18:48,087
- Oh, boy.
- How much time will it take?

288
00:18:48,168 --> 00:18:50,398
Yeah. And what the heck
is the show about?

289
00:18:50,488 --> 00:18:52,001
You, Mr Danforth.

290
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:54,597
Me?

291
00:18:57,128 --> 00:19:00,564
The spring musicale is all about you.

292
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:08,243
Hold up. If it's about me,
then can I have my ball back? Please?

293
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:12,038
- It's about all of you.
- Go!

294
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:13,846
And all of you will create it.

295
00:19:13,928 --> 00:19:19,127
A show about your final days
at East High. We'll call it Senior Year.

296
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,402
Genius.

297
00:19:21,848 --> 00:19:23,964
Playing a role is easy,

298
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:26,642
but being yourself,
now that's a challenge.

299
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:28,161
Miss Darbus, exactly...

300
00:19:28,248 --> 00:19:30,808
Kelsi will compose,
Ryan will choreograph

301
00:19:30,888 --> 00:19:33,243
- and I will direct.
- Thank you.

302
00:19:33,328 --> 00:19:37,844
Now, I have
some very important news from...

303
00:19:39,288 --> 00:19:42,519
...the Juilliard School
in New York City,

304
00:19:42,608 --> 00:19:46,157
America's pre-eminent college
for the performing arts.

305
00:19:46,248 --> 00:19:49,638
And for the first time
in East High history,

306
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:52,845
Juilliard is considering four of you

307
00:19:52,928 --> 00:19:55,567
for one available scholarship.

308
00:19:55,648 --> 00:19:58,446
- Miss Sharpay Evans.
- I'm already packed.

309
00:19:58,608 --> 00:20:01,486
- Mr Ryan Evans.
- Dance.

310
00:20:01,568 --> 00:20:04,685
- Miss Kelsi Nielsen.
- What? They got my letter?

311
00:20:04,768 --> 00:20:06,121
They certainly did.

312
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:10,520
And, lastly, Mr Troy Bolton.

313
00:20:10,608 --> 00:20:12,439
What?

314
00:20:13,008 --> 00:20:17,445
Juilliard will be sending
representatives to observe our show.

315
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:23,077
So good luck to our four applicants.

316
00:20:24,168 --> 00:20:27,319
Yeah, nice. Nice, guys.
That's pretty funny.

317
00:20:28,488 --> 00:20:31,048
So... who's the big comedian?

318
00:20:31,128 --> 00:20:35,007
- Is there something wrong?
- Yeah. Yeah, I didn't apply.

319
00:20:36,048 --> 00:20:40,405
- I've never heard of Juilliard.
- Well, that may be, Mr Bolton,

320
00:20:40,488 --> 00:20:43,321
but evidently Juilliard
has heard of you.

321
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:47,803
And as you create this show,
you must dig deep

322
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:52,086
and think about your aspirations
and dreams for the future.

323
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,840
Line up, downstage, please.

324
00:20:57,288 --> 00:21:00,803
Let's begin with Mr Danforth.
Step forward, please.

325
00:21:01,968 --> 00:21:02,957
Your future.

326
00:21:03,728 --> 00:21:06,720
It's easy. It's U of A.
Hoops all the way.

327
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:10,437
- Yeah.
- Miss McKessie.

328
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:13,281
I'm going to be the President
of the United States.

329
00:21:14,448 --> 00:21:16,803
I'm going to finish
college first, of course.

330
00:21:17,968 --> 00:21:19,686
Martha Cox, you're late.

331
00:21:19,768 --> 00:21:22,919
I'm sorry, I just thought maybe
we could use a few more dancers.

332
00:21:29,168 --> 00:21:31,966
I feel a show coming on already!

333
00:21:39,848 --> 00:21:41,281
Mr Bolton.

334
00:21:42,408 --> 00:21:43,727
Mr Bolton.

335
00:21:44,568 --> 00:21:47,128
- Your future.
- Oh, yeah...

336
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:51,287
You know...

337
00:21:53,768 --> 00:21:55,247
I've been thinking about...

338
00:22:01,688 --> 00:22:04,407
I think we should stage
the perfect prom.

339
00:22:05,088 --> 00:22:08,205
Golly gee, how adorable.
What do I want?

340
00:22:08,768 --> 00:22:11,521
Gosh, I wouldn't know where to begin.

341
00:22:12,648 --> 00:22:14,604
But I know where it ends.

342
00:22:14,688 --> 00:22:16,201
Centre stage.

343
00:22:17,688 --> 00:22:19,280
A single spotlight.

344
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:24,884
A huge marquee that reads...

345
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:39,840
New York deli platter, please.

346
00:22:39,928 --> 00:22:43,284
- How can you think about food?
- Maybe because it's lunch time?

347
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:45,882
No pickles.
Throw that Big Apple parfait in.

348
00:22:45,968 --> 00:22:48,357
OK, this show is our last shot, Ryan.

349
00:22:50,888 --> 00:22:54,198
Sharpay's meal, please.
Thanks. That's great.

350
00:22:54,288 --> 00:22:57,166
Troy pretended
to know nothing about Juilliard.

351
00:22:57,248 --> 00:22:59,637
- Give me a break.
- He seemed surprised to me.

352
00:22:59,728 --> 00:23:02,526
The theatre fairy magically
sent in Troy's application?

353
00:23:03,248 --> 00:23:07,082
Performers can't fool me. They're
deceitful, ambitious and ruthless.

354
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:09,841
- Aren't we performers?
- Exactly.

355
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,527
Imagine having everything
we ever dreamed

356
00:23:15,688 --> 00:23:17,167
- Don't you want it?
- Maybe

357
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:19,000
- Can't ya see it?
- Kinda

358
00:23:19,088 --> 00:23:21,886
Imagine first audition
after college I get the lead

359
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,526
- A part for me?
- Well, of course

360
00:23:23,728 --> 00:23:24,922
- Yeah, right
- You gotta believe it

361
00:23:25,008 --> 00:23:26,043
Keep talking

362
00:23:26,128 --> 00:23:29,564
- You and I, all the fame
- Sharpay and what's-his-name

363
00:23:29,648 --> 00:23:30,683
- Sound exciting?
- Inviting

364
00:23:30,848 --> 00:23:32,201
- Let's do it then
- Listening

365
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:35,081
Personal stylist, agent and a publicist

366
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:38,160
- But where do I fit into this?
- With you, we can win

367
00:23:38,248 --> 00:23:40,398
- Win the part?
- Think bigger

368
00:23:40,568 --> 00:23:43,799
- Become superstars?
- That's better

369
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:46,402
Don't you see that bigger is better

370
00:23:46,568 --> 00:23:48,081
And better is bigger

371
00:23:48,248 --> 00:23:50,682
A little bit it is never enough
No, no, no

372
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:52,122
Don't you want it all

373
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:54,563
You want it
You know that you want it

374
00:23:55,448 --> 00:23:57,245
The fame and the fortune and more

375
00:23:57,328 --> 00:23:58,397
You want it all

376
00:23:58,488 --> 00:24:01,161
You want it
You know that you want it

377
00:24:01,248 --> 00:24:03,762
You gotta have your star on the door

378
00:24:03,848 --> 00:24:05,600
You want the world, nothing less

379
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:07,201
All the glam and the press

380
00:24:07,368 --> 00:24:09,359
Only giving you the best reviews

381
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,325
- Say it!
- I want it all

382
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,922
I want it, I want it, want it

383
00:24:14,008 --> 00:24:18,240
My name in lights at Carnegie Hall
I want it all

384
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:19,921
- Can't you see it?
- Yeah

385
00:24:20,088 --> 00:24:21,680
They're gonna love me

386
00:24:21,848 --> 00:24:23,167
I mean us

387
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:27,524
Red carpet, rose bouquets
Crowd waiting backstage

388
00:24:27,608 --> 00:24:30,281
I'm with her, don't stop me
I'm not the paparazzi

389
00:24:30,488 --> 00:24:33,400
Invitations
Standing ovations

390
00:24:33,488 --> 00:24:35,046
- Magazines
- Yes, please

391
00:24:35,208 --> 00:24:36,641
Gonna be celebrities

392
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,720
Photographs, fan club
Give the people what they love

393
00:24:39,888 --> 00:24:41,401
- Now you're excited
- I like it

394
00:24:41,568 --> 00:24:43,206
- Let's do it then
- I love you!

395
00:24:43,288 --> 00:24:46,086
Times Square, jetsetter
Sequels pay better

396
00:24:46,288 --> 00:24:48,848
New York today
Tomorrow the world

397
00:24:48,928 --> 00:24:51,442
- Sold out shows?
- Think bigger

398
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:54,799
- And the Oscar goes to...
- That's better

399
00:24:55,008 --> 00:24:58,842
Don't ya see that bigger is better
and better is bigger

400
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:01,767
A little bit is never enough
No, no, no

401
00:25:01,888 --> 00:25:05,483
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it

402
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:08,123
The fame and the fortune and more

403
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:12,042
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it

404
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:15,006
I gotta have my star on the door

405
00:25:15,088 --> 00:25:18,444
I want the world, nothing less
All the glam and the press

406
00:25:18,528 --> 00:25:21,042
Only giving me the best reviews

407
00:25:21,128 --> 00:25:24,564
I want it all
I want it, want it, want it

408
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:28,641
Radio City Music Hall
We want it all

409
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:33,643
Here in the spotlight we shine
Look at who we are

410
00:25:35,008 --> 00:25:37,476
When Broadway knows your name

411
00:25:37,648 --> 00:25:43,006
- Get out of the way!
- You know that you're a star

412
00:25:44,808 --> 00:25:47,197
Oh, dance

413
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:54,159
- Madison Square Garden!
- They love you.

414
00:25:54,248 --> 00:25:56,398
Thank you! Thank you all!

415
00:25:57,728 --> 00:25:59,002
It's Oprah calling.

416
00:25:59,528 --> 00:26:00,881
Again.

417
00:26:00,968 --> 00:26:02,765
She wants you on the show.

418
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:05,485
They're going to get back to you.

419
00:26:05,568 --> 00:26:08,366
- You know how fast you were going?
- Officer Chad!

420
00:26:08,448 --> 00:26:11,599
Hey, it's Ms Evans. How you doing?
Follow me.

421
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:15,166
I want it, l-l-I want it, want it

422
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:18,763
I want it, I want it
l-l-I want it all, yeah

423
00:26:18,888 --> 00:26:21,960
I want it, l-l-I want it, want it

424
00:26:22,048 --> 00:26:25,085
- I want it, l-l-I want it
- I want it all

425
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:29,719
I gotta, ooh, I gotta
I want to, I have to, I want to

426
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:34,726
I want it, I want it
I have to have it

427
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:37,163
I want it, I have to

428
00:26:37,248 --> 00:26:41,127
- I want it all
- I want it, want it, want it

429
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:44,598
- The fame and the fortune and more
- I want it all

430
00:26:44,808 --> 00:26:47,368
I want it, want it, want it

431
00:26:47,448 --> 00:26:50,121
I gotta have my star on the door

432
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:53,325
I want the world, nothing less
All the glam and the press

433
00:26:53,448 --> 00:26:57,361
Only giving me the best reviews
I want it all

434
00:26:57,448 --> 00:27:00,485
Paris, London, Rome, Toronto

435
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:03,640
L.A., Sydney, Buenos Aires

436
00:27:03,728 --> 00:27:06,196
Tokyo, Moscow, Bollywood

437
00:27:07,848 --> 00:27:09,122
New York City

438
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:12,922
We want it...

439
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:15,363
All

440
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:35,516
It's ours, Ryan.

441
00:27:36,928 --> 00:27:40,921
Wait a minute. Miss D said
that there's only one scholarship.

442
00:27:41,008 --> 00:27:42,600
There's two of us.

443
00:27:42,688 --> 00:27:45,361
We're twins.
They're going to have to take us both.

444
00:27:45,448 --> 00:27:48,997
Listen, Kelsi always writes
her best songs for Troy and Gabriella.

445
00:27:49,088 --> 00:27:52,239
So you make certain
we get those songs.

446
00:27:52,328 --> 00:27:53,807
How?

447
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:57,847
Polish her glasses, buy her
some ruby slippers, take her to prom.

448
00:27:57,928 --> 00:27:59,247
I don't know.

449
00:28:00,408 --> 00:28:01,397
Just do it.

450
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,960
- Hey, Tay.
- Morning, Sunshine.

451
00:28:13,128 --> 00:28:15,688
- You going to rehearsals today?
- Do I have a choice?

452
00:28:15,848 --> 00:28:19,443
You got us into this. I don't
understand. You might not be here.

453
00:28:19,528 --> 00:28:22,326
Told anyone you're up for
Stanford's Freshman Honours?

454
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:23,477
No.

455
00:28:23,568 --> 00:28:25,559
You're gonna hear from them any day.

456
00:28:26,688 --> 00:28:28,918
- Hello?
- Taylor, these things take time.

457
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:33,168
- Hey.
- I need you right away.

458
00:28:33,248 --> 00:28:34,567
- What?
- Look up.

459
00:28:38,768 --> 00:28:39,917
I have to go.

460
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:42,476
This has two weeks detention
written all over it.

461
00:28:44,768 --> 00:28:46,042
Have fun.

462
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,644
I really need your help.

463
00:28:53,728 --> 00:28:55,923
Which one do you think I should wear?

464
00:28:56,008 --> 00:28:58,727
Because?

465
00:28:58,808 --> 00:29:03,120
Because you're going to have a pretty
dress, so I want to look right.

466
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:08,245
I've never been asked to a prom, but
this almost sounds like an invitation.

467
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:09,602
This one.

468
00:29:14,848 --> 00:29:18,363
I've never been to a dance,
much less a prom.

469
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:25,441
But I was hoping these
might be a good start.

470
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:32,764
Do you think we're going
to have to waltz?

471
00:29:33,848 --> 00:29:35,679
Because I have no idea how to do that.

472
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:39,998
All I know is what my dad taught me
when I was a little girl.

473
00:29:40,088 --> 00:29:43,205
I'd stand on his toes, and he'd
waltz me around the living room.

474
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:45,962
Come here. L'll show you.

475
00:29:46,528 --> 00:29:47,722
- What?
- Come here.

476
00:29:49,448 --> 00:29:50,801
We're on the roof.

477
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:01,887
Come here. You'll love it.

478
00:30:06,408 --> 00:30:08,968
Take my hand

479
00:30:09,048 --> 00:30:10,766
Take a breath

480
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:13,760
Pull me close

481
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:16,362
And take one step

482
00:30:16,448 --> 00:30:19,281
Keep your eyes

483
00:30:19,368 --> 00:30:21,598
Locked on mine

484
00:30:21,688 --> 00:30:23,918
And let the music

485
00:30:24,008 --> 00:30:26,886
Be your guide

486
00:30:26,968 --> 00:30:31,246
- Won't you promise me
- Now won't you promise me

487
00:30:31,328 --> 00:30:33,888
- That you'll never forget
- We'll keep dancing

488
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:37,643
- To keep dancing wherever we go next
- Wherever we go next

489
00:30:37,728 --> 00:30:40,162
It's like catching lightning

490
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:42,443
The chances of finding

491
00:30:42,528 --> 00:30:46,282
Someone like you

492
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:50,117
It's one in a million

493
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:52,642
The chances of feeling

494
00:30:52,728 --> 00:30:57,119
The way we do

495
00:30:57,208 --> 00:31:02,487
And with every step together

496
00:31:02,568 --> 00:31:07,881
We just keep on getting better

497
00:31:07,968 --> 00:31:12,007
- So can I have this dance?
- Can I have this dance?

498
00:31:12,088 --> 00:31:16,001
Can I have this dance?

499
00:31:18,088 --> 00:31:20,886
No mountain's too high, and no

500
00:31:20,968 --> 00:31:23,163
Ocean's too wide

501
00:31:23,248 --> 00:31:28,003
'Cause together or not
our dance won't stop

502
00:31:28,088 --> 00:31:29,441
Let it rain...

503
00:31:29,528 --> 00:31:33,567
Let it pour
What we have is worth fighting for

504
00:31:33,648 --> 00:31:38,563
You know I believe
that we were meant to be

505
00:31:40,968 --> 00:31:46,167
It's like catching lightning
The chances of finding

506
00:31:46,248 --> 00:31:51,197
Someone like you

507
00:31:51,288 --> 00:31:55,998
It's one in a million
The chances of feeling

508
00:31:56,088 --> 00:32:00,320
The way we do

509
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:05,277
And with every step together

510
00:32:05,368 --> 00:32:10,886
We just keep on getting better

511
00:32:10,968 --> 00:32:15,120
- So can I have this dance?
- Can I have this dance?

512
00:32:15,208 --> 00:32:18,564
Can I have this dance?

513
00:32:19,928 --> 00:32:25,002
- Can I have...
- This dance?

514
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:30,003
Can I have this dance?

515
00:32:36,968 --> 00:32:39,880
- So is that a yes?
- In every language.

516
00:32:42,608 --> 00:32:43,597
Yes.

517
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:47,121
Oh, come on!

518
00:32:55,008 --> 00:32:56,202
Where's our clothes?

519
00:32:58,048 --> 00:33:00,482
- Yo, Rocket Man.
- Oh, there they are.

520
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:03,162
- Thought you wanted our lockers.
- It's moving day.

521
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:04,647
Oh, sweet.

522
00:33:04,728 --> 00:33:06,684
- Good job.
- Thanks, man.

523
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:10,164
Perfect timing, Bolton.

524
00:33:10,248 --> 00:33:13,046
We weren't just given these lockers.
We had to earn them.

525
00:33:13,248 --> 00:33:15,159
Right. Right. Thanks, man.

526
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:19,643
- Chad, what's the combo?
- What's the combo?

527
00:33:19,808 --> 00:33:22,766
It's like he said. You got to earn them.

528
00:33:22,848 --> 00:33:24,566
What's that supposed to mean?

529
00:33:24,648 --> 00:33:27,082
Hey, guys! Come back.
What are you talking about?

530
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:30,001
- Not cool, guys!
- Hey, Bolton! Danforth!

531
00:33:33,488 --> 00:33:34,967
Hey, stop playing games!

532
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:38,924
This isn't funny, guys!

533
00:33:40,808 --> 00:33:42,321
Chad, up top.

534
00:33:42,408 --> 00:33:44,638
- I got it.
- Spike!

535
00:33:44,888 --> 00:33:47,118
- Let's go! Out!
- Give me my clothes!

536
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:50,837
- This isn't funny, guys!
- Just give me my clothes, man!

537
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,247
Look out. Coming through.

538
00:33:54,768 --> 00:33:57,885
Hey, those are new jeans!
I need those back!

539
00:34:00,088 --> 00:34:04,923
Arms, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

540
00:34:05,008 --> 00:34:07,078
You're really stressing me out.

541
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:09,807
I need to breathe.
And I don't know what Ryan is doing.

542
00:34:09,968 --> 00:34:12,880
He's doing some kind
of yoga Fosse thing.

543
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:17,120
Two, three, four... What are you
doing? ...six, seven, eight.

544
00:34:17,248 --> 00:34:21,560
One, two, three, great,
five, six, seven...

545
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:23,286
Troy, just give me my clothes!

546
00:34:27,128 --> 00:34:29,244
- Yearbook opportunity.
- Photo op.

547
00:34:30,808 --> 00:34:32,161
Smile!

548
00:34:40,128 --> 00:34:43,120
- Hi.
- Bold choice, gentlemen.

549
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:47,367
We all must have the courage
to discover ourselves.

550
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:49,484
However, at East High,

551
00:34:49,568 --> 00:34:53,163
we will discover ourselves
whilst clothed.

552
00:34:54,568 --> 00:34:57,526
But welcome to our drama club
and our spring musicale.

553
00:34:57,608 --> 00:34:59,360
Yeah, welcome.

554
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:05,476
The stage crew can use
your help during detention...

555
00:35:05,568 --> 00:35:07,047
...painting sets.

556
00:35:07,808 --> 00:35:09,127
Throw a sheet over them.

557
00:35:10,128 --> 00:35:11,481
Ryan!

558
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:14,720
OK. All right, guys,
let's go back up to the top.

559
00:35:14,888 --> 00:35:17,482
Jason, why don't you come
down here and help me out.

560
00:35:24,048 --> 00:35:25,367
Fuel pump...

561
00:35:25,808 --> 00:35:28,322
...work in progress.
If my truck falls apart

562
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:31,127
because I'm spending my time onstage,
it's your fault.

563
00:35:32,968 --> 00:35:36,597
You think I'd be spending any time
at all up there if it wasn't for you?

564
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:39,359
You know what? I do.

565
00:35:40,488 --> 00:35:42,479
- What?
- You're so good.

566
00:35:43,608 --> 00:35:46,759
I watch you in rehearsals. You love it.

567
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:49,123
Why is that so hard for you to admit?

568
00:35:50,088 --> 00:35:51,521
It isn't, to you.

569
00:35:52,528 --> 00:35:57,477
But to my dad? To Chad?
Yeah, it's a little hard.

570
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,126
It shouldn't be.

571
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:05,201
They're happy as long
as we're all talking about U of A.

572
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:10,567
You chose Stanford.
U of A was sort of chosen for me.

573
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:14,520
I haven't talked
to anybody about this, but...

574
00:36:14,648 --> 00:36:17,321
...I've had offers from other colleges.

575
00:36:19,168 --> 00:36:22,399
- I'm really listening.
- I get it, Troy.

576
00:36:24,088 --> 00:36:26,158
I still have decisions to make, too.

577
00:36:27,408 --> 00:36:28,477
Like what?

578
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:34,437
I thought I heard you. I was just making
some snacks inside. Are you guys hungry?

579
00:36:37,408 --> 00:36:42,118
- I interrupted something, didn't I?
- Just talking, Mom.

580
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:45,200
- Homework.
- OK.

581
00:36:48,128 --> 00:36:51,438
Speaking about homework... come on.

582
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:53,405
I was joking.

583
00:37:04,408 --> 00:37:07,206
Compliments of Zeke.
Be careful, they're still hot.

584
00:37:07,288 --> 00:37:09,597
He doesn't know they're gone.
Eat the evidence.

585
00:37:09,808 --> 00:37:12,766
Kissing up to the yearbook editors.
Very smart move.

586
00:37:12,848 --> 00:37:15,123
Chad's hoping
for two pages on himself.

587
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:17,324
Maybe even a third page,
just for his hair.

588
00:37:18,248 --> 00:37:19,522
Hey, what's right is right.

589
00:37:20,808 --> 00:37:24,517
Hoops, by the way, could you take me
after school to check out that tuxedo?

590
00:37:26,328 --> 00:37:28,159
Tuxedo? For what?

591
00:37:29,128 --> 00:37:30,356
For prom.

592
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:33,167
Honey, if that's
what you call an invitation,

593
00:37:33,288 --> 00:37:35,085
you'll be dancing with yourself.

594
00:37:45,688 --> 00:37:49,522
- Yo, yo, yo. It's lunchtime.
- Come on, people. Go!

595
00:37:56,768 --> 00:37:58,520
- You ready?
- Yeah.

596
00:37:59,128 --> 00:38:00,356
It's now or never, man.

597
00:38:02,288 --> 00:38:04,722
The Garden Club is rooting for you.

598
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:14,086
- OK. I'm going in.
- Go get her.

599
00:38:16,608 --> 00:38:19,406
- Troy, I really just...
- No, we're doing this now.

600
00:38:19,488 --> 00:38:21,285
How long have you been up there?

601
00:38:21,448 --> 00:38:23,006
- Hair's great.
- Don't...

602
00:38:25,088 --> 00:38:26,487
I know. I heard that, too.

603
00:38:27,168 --> 00:38:28,601
- Yes, good.
- Yes. OK.

604
00:38:30,728 --> 00:38:33,640
- Your turn.
- So... Hey.

605
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:38,478
I was kind of wondering if you'd...
maybe go with me.

606
00:38:39,288 --> 00:38:43,566
Oh, hey, Chad. They have Tuna Surprise
on the menu. It's good. Really good.

607
00:38:45,808 --> 00:38:47,207
Dude.

608
00:38:49,128 --> 00:38:50,880
Taylor.

609
00:38:50,968 --> 00:38:52,845
Hey, I'm asking you to prom.

610
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,396
I'm sorry, I can't hear you
because it's so loud.

611
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,001
- Did you hear something?
- No.

612
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:01,047
- Neither did I.
- Excuse me. Excuse me, everybody.

613
00:39:01,128 --> 00:39:03,198
- What are you...?
- Yo!

614
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,720
My friend has something to say.

615
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,321
Taylor McKessie.

616
00:39:24,608 --> 00:39:27,566
Will you please be
my date to the senior prom?

617
00:39:38,248 --> 00:39:39,442
I'd be honoured.

618
00:39:47,048 --> 00:39:49,437
Dude, I need to go shoot
some hoops or something.

619
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:50,517
You nailed it!

620
00:39:51,368 --> 00:39:52,926
Guess now it's official

621
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:56,763
- Can't back out, can't back out
- No

622
00:39:56,848 --> 00:39:57,883
Gettin' ready

623
00:39:57,968 --> 00:40:02,246
For the night of nights
The night of nights, all right

624
00:40:02,328 --> 00:40:03,727
- Don't panic
- Panic

625
00:40:03,808 --> 00:40:06,880
Now do we have
to dress up for the prom

626
00:40:06,968 --> 00:40:09,766
Dude, I don't think we have the choice

627
00:40:09,848 --> 00:40:13,636
Yeah it's the night of all nights
Got to look just right

628
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:16,640
Dressin' to impress the boys

629
00:40:16,728 --> 00:40:18,923
Do I want classic or vintage or plaid

630
00:40:19,088 --> 00:40:21,761
- Where's the mirror
- I think this tux is too baggy

631
00:40:21,928 --> 00:40:23,600
Too tight
It makes me look weird

632
00:40:23,688 --> 00:40:25,724
Should I go movie star glamorous

633
00:40:25,808 --> 00:40:27,002
Sassy or sweet

634
00:40:27,168 --> 00:40:30,524
Don't know, but no one better wear
the same dress as me

635
00:40:30,608 --> 00:40:34,203
- It's the night of our nightmares
- It's the night of our dreams

636
00:40:34,288 --> 00:40:36,279
It's too late to back out of it

637
00:40:37,288 --> 00:40:40,724
- Makeovers, massages
- Don't know what a corsage is

638
00:40:40,888 --> 00:40:42,924
Been waiting all our lives for this

639
00:40:43,088 --> 00:40:45,522
- It's gonna be a night
- Can't wait

640
00:40:45,688 --> 00:40:47,201
- To remember
- Oh man

641
00:40:47,368 --> 00:40:49,598
Come on now
Big fun, all right

642
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:52,288
- It's gonna be the night
- I guess

643
00:40:52,448 --> 00:40:54,723
- To last forever
- Lucky us

644
00:40:54,888 --> 00:40:56,844
We'll never ever ever forget

645
00:40:58,608 --> 00:41:00,007
- Gettin' ready
- Get ready

646
00:41:00,128 --> 00:41:01,846
- Get, gettin' ready
- Get ready

647
00:41:01,928 --> 00:41:02,997
Gettin' ready

648
00:41:03,088 --> 00:41:05,761
Get, gettin' ready
Go

649
00:41:05,848 --> 00:41:07,884
Hey, you've been in there an hour.

650
00:41:07,968 --> 00:41:11,324
So, what should I do with my hair

651
00:41:11,408 --> 00:41:13,000
- Where's my shaver
- I love it

652
00:41:13,088 --> 00:41:15,079
- I look like a waiter
- Should I fluff it

653
00:41:15,168 --> 00:41:17,523
It's getting later already
Should be there

654
00:41:20,568 --> 00:41:24,243
Her mother opens the door
I'm shakin' inside

655
00:41:24,328 --> 00:41:28,287
He's here, it's time
The hour's arrived

656
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:31,520
Don't know why
her father's starin' me down

657
00:41:31,608 --> 00:41:35,078
Where's my purse, lip gloss?
Now I'm really freakin' out

658
00:41:36,048 --> 00:41:37,766
Then something changes my world

659
00:41:37,928 --> 00:41:41,159
The most beautiful girl
Right in front of my eyes

660
00:41:41,288 --> 00:41:43,563
- It's gonna be a night
- Oh yeah

661
00:41:43,728 --> 00:41:45,525
- To remember
- That's for sure

662
00:41:45,688 --> 00:41:47,918
Come on now
Big fun, all right

663
00:41:48,088 --> 00:41:50,477
- It's gonna be the night
- Here tonight

664
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:52,564
- To last forever
- Forever more

665
00:41:52,728 --> 00:41:54,798
We'll never ever ever forget

666
00:42:07,168 --> 00:42:09,284
Guys, right here. Guys!

667
00:42:09,368 --> 00:42:12,644
Who's that girl?
She's so fine

668
00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:15,720
Who's that guy?
I don't recognise

669
00:42:15,808 --> 00:42:19,596
Who's that girl?
She looks so good, yeah

670
00:42:19,688 --> 00:42:22,998
Guess you never really noticed
But you probably should

671
00:42:23,088 --> 00:42:24,680
Big fun

672
00:42:24,768 --> 00:42:26,724
- On the night of nights
- All right

673
00:42:26,848 --> 00:42:28,804
The night of nights
Tonight

674
00:42:29,808 --> 00:42:31,605
Let's dance

675
00:42:31,688 --> 00:42:35,647
On the night of nights
You know we're gonna do it right

676
00:42:35,808 --> 00:42:39,403
It's gonna be a night
To remember

677
00:42:42,488 --> 00:42:46,003
It's gonna be the night
To last forever

678
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:53,282
It's gonna be our night
To remember

679
00:42:56,168 --> 00:43:00,286
It's gonna be the night
To last forever

680
00:43:03,008 --> 00:43:05,568
It's gonna be our night
You know it

681
00:43:05,728 --> 00:43:07,366
To remember
For all time

682
00:43:07,528 --> 00:43:09,803
Come on now
Big fun

683
00:43:09,888 --> 00:43:12,322
It's gonna be the night
We love it

684
00:43:12,408 --> 00:43:14,638
To last forever
The rest of our lives

685
00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:16,685
We'll never ever ever forget

686
00:43:16,848 --> 00:43:19,601
It's gonna be our night
Oh yeah

687
00:43:19,688 --> 00:43:21,201
All together
Say it loud

688
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:23,404
Come on now
Everyone, that's right

689
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:26,082
It's gonna be the night
Yeah, the night

690
00:43:26,248 --> 00:43:28,000
To remember
Hear the crowd

691
00:43:28,208 --> 00:43:29,436
And never ever ever

692
00:43:29,568 --> 00:43:32,241
Never ever ever never ever

693
00:43:32,328 --> 00:43:34,159
Never never forget

694
00:43:35,928 --> 00:43:39,762
Bravo! Brava! Lights, please!

695
00:43:41,448 --> 00:43:43,962
Kelsi, splendid music.

696
00:43:44,128 --> 00:43:47,882
Ryan, your choreography
is quite inventive.

697
00:43:48,048 --> 00:43:49,925
- Thank you.
- And, Jason,

698
00:43:50,008 --> 00:43:51,760
we do not chew gum
in theatre or prom.

699
00:43:51,928 --> 00:43:54,681
See me at detention.
Lighting crew needs help.

700
00:43:54,768 --> 00:43:56,679
Excellent work, everyone.

701
00:43:56,768 --> 00:43:59,726
Costumes on the rack.
I will see you all tomorrow.

702
00:44:01,808 --> 00:44:04,766
Kelsi's writing something
amazing for Troy and Gabriella.

703
00:44:05,608 --> 00:44:06,882
A song, most likely.

704
00:44:08,208 --> 00:44:10,278
- Just find out what it is.
- OK.

705
00:44:12,048 --> 00:44:16,360
Hi, Boi! How was I? Thank you!

706
00:44:18,688 --> 00:44:21,646
- Hey Troy, good job, man.
- Dude, stop doing that!

707
00:44:22,528 --> 00:44:24,280
I'm sorry.

708
00:44:24,368 --> 00:44:26,438
Look, there's Sharpay.

709
00:44:26,528 --> 00:44:29,884
Now, you didn't hear this from me,
but she has a secret crush on you.

710
00:44:30,048 --> 00:44:31,527
A secret crush on me?

711
00:44:34,128 --> 00:44:36,198
- Should I talk to her?
- Yeah.

712
00:44:36,328 --> 00:44:38,000
OK. All right.

713
00:44:38,088 --> 00:44:39,726
Mr Zara.

714
00:44:39,808 --> 00:44:43,084
Yo! You can call me
"Rocket Man" if you want to.

715
00:44:43,248 --> 00:44:44,397
How generous.

716
00:44:44,488 --> 00:44:48,197
Mr Zara, since you have become
such a dedicated presence,

717
00:44:48,288 --> 00:44:51,166
I'm making you an understudy.
Miss Gold!

718
00:44:53,048 --> 00:44:56,677
- You as well.
- Nice.

719
00:44:56,768 --> 00:44:58,281
I'm in!

720
00:44:58,368 --> 00:45:00,563
I'm playing "The Understudy".

721
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:02,320
- Congrats.
- Right. What's up?

722
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:04,319
"Understudy" isn't a role, you moron.

723
00:45:04,408 --> 00:45:07,127
You go on if one of the leads
can't make the performance.

724
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:10,962
Well, I hate to break it to you, sister,
but you're one, too.

725
00:45:12,328 --> 00:45:14,558
The difference being
I can carry a tune.

726
00:45:15,608 --> 00:45:18,486
Listen, I wouldn't sing
with you if my hair was on fire

727
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:21,037
and you were the last bucket
of water on Earth.

728
00:45:21,128 --> 00:45:23,164
I wouldn't sing with you
if I were starving

729
00:45:23,248 --> 00:45:26,001
and you were
the last pickle at the picnic.

730
00:45:26,088 --> 00:45:27,806
Want to go to lunch sometime?

731
00:45:30,888 --> 00:45:34,437
Gentlemen, start your engines.

732
00:45:34,528 --> 00:45:38,282
That's what I'm talking about, bro.
Yo, come check out these guitars.

733
00:45:41,848 --> 00:45:43,281
What is this?

734
00:45:49,168 --> 00:45:51,443
"Stanford's Honours
Programme cordially..."

735
00:45:51,528 --> 00:45:53,325
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my goodness!

736
00:45:53,408 --> 00:45:56,206
"You and 29 students
are invited for early orientation."

737
00:45:57,568 --> 00:46:00,765
Oh, my gosh, that's huge.
Your mom must be so proud.

738
00:46:00,848 --> 00:46:02,998
Taylor, you're the only one that knows.

739
00:46:03,088 --> 00:46:04,965
But you've already accepted, right?

740
00:46:05,048 --> 00:46:07,482
I'm throwing a going-away party.
This is huge!

741
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:10,765
You can't get rid of me that easy.
We've got a yearbook to do.

742
00:46:10,848 --> 00:46:12,122
- Back to work.
- OK.

743
00:46:12,208 --> 00:46:15,678
- These are Sharpay's yearbook photos.
- Of course they are. Thank you.

744
00:46:27,688 --> 00:46:30,486
- This better be good.
- They select only 30 freshmen

745
00:46:30,568 --> 00:46:35,278
from the entire incoming class. It's
a special three-weeks Honour programme.

746
00:46:35,368 --> 00:46:36,960
How prestigious.

747
00:46:38,888 --> 00:46:43,245
But the programme starts in two weeks.
She'd miss our sh... your show.

748
00:46:43,328 --> 00:46:46,320
Oh, my goodness. What to do?

749
00:46:47,648 --> 00:46:51,004
The show must go on, mustn't it?

750
00:47:25,728 --> 00:47:27,207
- Morning.
- Morning.

751
00:47:31,728 --> 00:47:33,286
"I just wanna be with you."

752
00:47:50,728 --> 00:47:54,323
I got a lot of things I have to do

753
00:47:55,608 --> 00:47:57,803
All these distractions

754
00:47:57,888 --> 00:48:00,402
Our future's coming soon

755
00:48:00,488 --> 00:48:02,206
We're being pulled

756
00:48:02,288 --> 00:48:05,519
A hundred different directions

757
00:48:05,608 --> 00:48:07,166
But whatever happens

758
00:48:07,248 --> 00:48:09,443
I know I've got you

759
00:48:10,888 --> 00:48:12,958
- It's beautiful.
- Thanks.

760
00:48:13,048 --> 00:48:15,846
I mean, really.
This, the prom number, everything.

761
00:48:15,928 --> 00:48:18,123
It's going to be a great show.

762
00:48:19,608 --> 00:48:23,442
- Speaking of prom, what are you doing?
- It's two days before the show.

763
00:48:23,528 --> 00:48:27,521
I'm writing orchestrations and fixing
charts. I still have to write lyrics.

764
00:48:27,608 --> 00:48:29,405
Great. L'll pick you up at 8.00.

765
00:48:30,248 --> 00:48:32,842
You're on my mind
You're in my heart

766
00:48:33,008 --> 00:48:34,839
It doesn't matter where we are

767
00:48:35,008 --> 00:48:36,964
We'll be all right

768
00:48:37,128 --> 00:48:40,803
Even if we're miles apart

769
00:48:41,448 --> 00:48:44,281
All I wanna do

770
00:48:45,328 --> 00:48:47,842
Is be with you

771
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:50,203
Be with you

772
00:48:50,368 --> 00:48:53,519
There's nothing we can't do

773
00:48:53,688 --> 00:48:58,204
Just wanna be with you, only you

774
00:48:58,368 --> 00:49:01,326
No matter where life takes us

775
00:49:01,448 --> 00:49:06,283
- Nothing can break us apart
- You know it's true

776
00:49:06,448 --> 00:49:09,087
I just wanna be with you

777
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:13,000
- Great!
- Awesome.

778
00:49:14,128 --> 00:49:16,084
Just be with you

779
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:21,883
You know how life can be
It changes overnight

780
00:49:21,968 --> 00:49:26,200
It's sunny then raining
but it's all right

781
00:49:27,048 --> 00:49:31,519
- A friend like you
- Always makes it easy

782
00:49:31,608 --> 00:49:35,760
- I know that you get me
- Every time

783
00:49:35,928 --> 00:49:40,797
Through every up through every down
You know l'll always be around

784
00:49:40,968 --> 00:49:45,996
Through anything you can count on me

785
00:49:46,928 --> 00:49:49,522
All I wanna do

786
00:49:50,848 --> 00:49:53,237
Is be with you

787
00:49:53,408 --> 00:49:55,319
Be with you

788
00:49:55,928 --> 00:49:59,238
There's nothing we can't do

789
00:49:59,328 --> 00:50:03,287
Just wanna be with you, only you

790
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:06,883
No matter where life takes us

791
00:50:07,008 --> 00:50:10,159
Nothing can break us apart

792
00:50:10,328 --> 00:50:11,681
You know it's true

793
00:50:11,848 --> 00:50:14,567
I just wanna be with you

794
00:50:16,368 --> 00:50:21,488
I just wanna be with you

795
00:50:26,408 --> 00:50:29,878
Bravo! Great rehearsal.
Pity the actor that has to follow you.

796
00:50:29,968 --> 00:50:32,402
I believe that actor is you,
Mr Choreographer.

797
00:50:33,368 --> 00:50:34,357
Oh, really?

798
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:37,565
- OK, let's take five and run it again.
- Yes!

799
00:50:37,728 --> 00:50:41,004
- Ryan!
- That's five, everybody.

800
00:50:43,928 --> 00:50:45,964
Did you get a copy
of that song from Kelsi?

801
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:49,325
No. But I'm taking her to prom.

802
00:50:50,368 --> 00:50:54,646
Brilliant. Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer.

803
00:50:55,328 --> 00:50:56,647
Now get me that duet.

804
00:50:58,008 --> 00:51:00,568
Sharpay, you are not Gabriella.

805
00:51:02,328 --> 00:51:03,681
Don't be so sure.

806
00:51:11,128 --> 00:51:14,120
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey, the boys are back.

807
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:15,721
- Hey, Bob.
- How are you?

808
00:51:25,848 --> 00:51:27,884
- Mr Riley.
- Troy.

809
00:51:27,968 --> 00:51:31,643
There is nothing like the purr of
a well-tuned engine. That wasn't it.

810
00:51:31,728 --> 00:51:35,767
Yeah. My fuel pump's deceased.
You have a radiator cap for me?

811
00:51:35,848 --> 00:51:38,567
- Heard of duct tape?
- That's what I got on it now.

812
00:51:38,648 --> 00:51:41,446
Dig around over there.
I'm sure you'll find what you want.

813
00:51:41,528 --> 00:51:45,282
I am so excited about you boys
playing at the U of A next year.

814
00:51:45,488 --> 00:51:48,958
I bought my season tickets.
I got to take off early today,

815
00:51:49,048 --> 00:51:50,720
so lock up when you're done.

816
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:52,719
- Yeah.
- You know where the key is.

817
00:51:52,808 --> 00:51:55,561
- Say "hey" to Coach.
- Will do.

818
00:51:55,648 --> 00:51:59,243
Did you hear that? He's got season
tickets. Time to start practicing.

819
00:52:00,648 --> 00:52:02,161
Take a breather, LeBron.

820
00:52:03,848 --> 00:52:06,237
Feel like your future
is laid out in front of you?

821
00:52:06,408 --> 00:52:09,127
- What is your point?
- I don't know.

822
00:52:10,728 --> 00:52:12,684
I just want my future to be my future.

823
00:52:14,768 --> 00:52:18,602
Do you see what happens when you
do a show? You're, like, five people.

824
00:52:18,688 --> 00:52:21,122
Yeah, but what's so bad about that?

825
00:52:21,208 --> 00:52:23,517
We used to come here as kids,
we'd be ten people.

826
00:52:23,688 --> 00:52:27,283
We'd be spies, superheroes, rock stars.

827
00:52:27,368 --> 00:52:31,805
Hold this. We were whatever we wanted
to be, whenever we wanted to be it.

828
00:52:33,888 --> 00:52:35,003
It was us.

829
00:52:35,168 --> 00:52:36,999
Yeah, we were,
like, eight years old.

830
00:52:37,088 --> 00:52:39,477
For the record,

831
00:52:39,568 --> 00:52:41,445
I was a better superhero than you were.

832
00:52:44,288 --> 00:52:47,246
Take it back to the place
when you know it all began

833
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,716
We could be anything we wanna be

834
00:52:52,408 --> 00:52:55,366
We can tell by the noise
that the boys are back again

835
00:52:56,328 --> 00:52:58,717
Together making history

836
00:52:58,888 --> 00:53:00,116
It's time to show how

837
00:53:00,248 --> 00:53:02,603
To be a superhero

838
00:53:02,808 --> 00:53:04,082
Just like a showdown

839
00:53:04,248 --> 00:53:06,682
Will Smith and Bobby De Niro

840
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:08,287
We're the best, no doubt

841
00:53:08,488 --> 00:53:09,921
Doing it like we used to do

842
00:53:10,008 --> 00:53:12,158
This is our town, yeah

843
00:53:12,248 --> 00:53:13,237
And I'm telling you

844
00:53:13,368 --> 00:53:18,203
Oh, the boys are back
Hey, the boys are back, that's right

845
00:53:18,288 --> 00:53:20,040
The boys are back
Gonna do it again

846
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:22,483
Gonna wake up the neighbourhood

847
00:53:22,648 --> 00:53:26,323
The boys are back, yeah
The boys are back, all right

848
00:53:26,408 --> 00:53:28,285
Climbing up the walls
any time we want

849
00:53:28,448 --> 00:53:31,167
The word is out, the boys are back

850
00:53:31,328 --> 00:53:32,602
The boys are back

851
00:53:33,368 --> 00:53:34,721
Back to save the day

852
00:53:35,688 --> 00:53:36,803
The boys are back

853
00:53:37,008 --> 00:53:38,157
Oh, yeah

854
00:53:40,448 --> 00:53:43,360
Keep coming with the right
Win the fight, every single time

855
00:53:44,088 --> 00:53:47,046
Undefeated here in our house
Yeah

856
00:53:48,368 --> 00:53:51,246
We can rock, we can shock
Any time we like

857
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,801
And tonight we're going all out

858
00:53:54,968 --> 00:53:56,321
It's time to show how

859
00:53:56,488 --> 00:53:58,683
To be a superhero, oh

860
00:53:58,848 --> 00:54:00,201
Just like a showdown

861
00:54:00,408 --> 00:54:02,876
Keep the pedal to the metal
Go!

862
00:54:03,048 --> 00:54:04,276
We're the best, no doubt

863
00:54:04,448 --> 00:54:06,723
Doing it like we used to do

864
00:54:06,888 --> 00:54:08,367
This is our town

865
00:54:08,528 --> 00:54:10,723
And I'm telling you
Oh, look out

866
00:54:10,808 --> 00:54:12,241
The boys are back, hey

867
00:54:12,328 --> 00:54:14,558
- The boys are back
- That's right

868
00:54:14,648 --> 00:54:18,402
The boys are back, gonna do it again
Gonna wake up the neighbourhood

869
00:54:18,488 --> 00:54:20,604
The boys are back, yeah

870
00:54:20,688 --> 00:54:22,485
- The boys are back
- All right

871
00:54:22,568 --> 00:54:28,245
Climbing up the walls, any time we want
The word is out, the boys are back

872
00:54:28,328 --> 00:54:30,239
Here to change the world

873
00:54:30,408 --> 00:54:32,763
To solve the mystery, fight the battle

874
00:54:32,888 --> 00:54:34,367
Save the girl

875
00:54:35,488 --> 00:54:37,797
No one
No one can stop us now

876
00:54:37,968 --> 00:54:43,042
We're the ones that make the rules

877
00:55:11,048 --> 00:55:13,687
No, no, no, hey! No, no, no, no! Hey!

878
00:55:15,848 --> 00:55:17,042
The boys are back

879
00:55:21,808 --> 00:55:24,447
Oh, yeah

880
00:55:24,608 --> 00:55:28,760
The boys are back
Hey, the boys are back, that's right

881
00:55:28,848 --> 00:55:30,520
The boys are back
Gonna do it again

882
00:55:30,688 --> 00:55:32,565
Gonna wake up the neighbourhood

883
00:55:32,728 --> 00:55:36,516
The boys are back, yeah
The boys are back, all right

884
00:55:36,648 --> 00:55:38,878
Climbing up the walls
any time we want

885
00:55:39,048 --> 00:55:40,640
No need to worry, 'cause...

886
00:55:40,808 --> 00:55:44,562
The boys are back
Hey, the boys are back

887
00:55:44,768 --> 00:55:46,724
The boys are back
Gonna do it again

888
00:55:46,808 --> 00:55:48,639
And we make it look good

889
00:55:48,808 --> 00:55:52,357
The boys are back
Yeah, the boys are back

890
00:55:52,448 --> 00:55:54,598
Tearing down the walls
any time we want

891
00:55:54,808 --> 00:55:57,003
I'm sure that you know by now

892
00:56:00,408 --> 00:56:01,523
The boys are back

893
00:56:08,848 --> 00:56:11,316
What are you gonna do
if Juilliard says yes?

894
00:56:12,848 --> 00:56:15,806
- I don't know.
- That's not what I wanted to hear.

895
00:56:16,768 --> 00:56:19,407
I'm getting your butt back
in the gym tomorrow. Got me?

896
00:56:19,488 --> 00:56:20,967
So I can whoop your butt?

897
00:56:21,048 --> 00:56:24,484
- Dream on.
- With my eyes closed.

898
00:56:25,728 --> 00:56:29,687
You should be celebrating,
not keeping it a secret.

899
00:56:29,768 --> 00:56:32,999
The programme starts at Stanford
next week. L'll miss everything.

900
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:35,238
No, you won't.
Just the show.

901
00:56:35,328 --> 00:56:38,081
You can come back for prom
and graduation.

902
00:56:38,168 --> 00:56:40,363
Girl your future is calling
loud and clear.

903
00:56:40,448 --> 00:56:45,078
- You have to grab it while you can.
- Taylor, stop being my mom

904
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:49,127
and just be my friend.
Maybe I like it here.

905
00:56:49,208 --> 00:56:52,200
Maybe I wanna stay in Albuquerque
as long as possible.

906
00:56:54,528 --> 00:56:56,280
Maybe l'll just stay here next year.

907
00:56:56,368 --> 00:56:57,721
What?

908
00:57:00,968 --> 00:57:03,687
Stay in Albuquerque?
That makes no sense.

909
00:57:03,768 --> 00:57:06,328
Why do I always have to make sense?

910
00:57:06,408 --> 00:57:10,401
L'll still go to Stanford,
just maybe in a year.

911
00:57:10,488 --> 00:57:13,048
I can take classes
at U of A next fall or something.

912
00:57:13,128 --> 00:57:15,517
Did you say U of A?

913
00:57:19,128 --> 00:57:23,758
It's obvious you're not thinking clear
because you're thinking about Troy.

914
00:57:23,848 --> 00:57:26,681
I get it,
that he's your first crush, but...

915
00:57:37,408 --> 00:57:39,239
I'm sorry.

916
00:57:43,008 --> 00:57:45,920
I meant relationship.

917
00:57:48,328 --> 00:57:51,559
But there will be other guys.

918
00:57:52,608 --> 00:57:54,246
I promise.

919
00:57:58,688 --> 00:58:01,521
I... I'm late for dinner.

920
00:58:01,608 --> 00:58:03,838
I'm... Sorry.

921
00:58:17,648 --> 00:58:21,277
You know, high school feels like it's
the most important thing in the world

922
00:58:21,368 --> 00:58:23,120
when you're in it.

923
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:26,120
But that changes.

924
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:28,802
Not everything has to change, Mom.

925
00:58:30,688 --> 00:58:32,758
I don't believe that.

926
00:58:32,848 --> 00:58:35,726
And this from the girl
who used to think she could just

927
00:58:35,808 --> 00:58:39,437
reach up and rearrange
the stars in the sky.

928
00:58:42,088 --> 00:58:44,841
Sometimes, life just happens,

929
00:58:44,928 --> 00:58:48,159
whether we want it to or not.

930
00:58:51,648 --> 00:58:53,445
I love you too, Mom.

931
00:59:10,248 --> 00:59:12,125
...stepped on...
- Redhawks!

932
00:59:12,208 --> 00:59:14,961
Hey, first game is here
against Trinity.

933
00:59:15,048 --> 00:59:17,562
But the next game is away
against Tulane.

934
00:59:17,648 --> 00:59:19,639
That's in New Orleans, right?

935
00:59:19,728 --> 00:59:21,684
Road trip!

936
00:59:23,048 --> 00:59:26,404
- To our boys.
- To our boys!

937
00:59:26,488 --> 00:59:28,558
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

938
00:59:31,008 --> 00:59:33,761
- Go Redhawks!
- Go Redhawks!

939
00:59:33,848 --> 00:59:36,157
- Redhawks!
- Seriously.

940
01:00:04,488 --> 01:00:07,082
If this were forever

941
01:00:07,168 --> 01:00:08,999
What could be better

942
01:00:09,088 --> 01:00:12,444
We've already proved it works

943
01:00:12,528 --> 01:00:17,204
But in 2, 123 hours

944
01:00:17,288 --> 01:00:20,360
Abandon the universe

945
01:00:20,448 --> 01:00:23,520
It's gonna make everything

946
01:00:23,608 --> 01:00:26,759
In our whole world change

947
01:00:26,848 --> 01:00:29,078
It's all changing

948
01:00:29,168 --> 01:00:32,240
- And you know that where we are
- Where we are

949
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:36,526
Will never be the same

950
01:00:38,448 --> 01:00:42,441
Right here

951
01:00:42,528 --> 01:00:46,840
- Right now
- Oh, right now

952
01:00:46,928 --> 01:00:51,240
Tomorrow can wait
for some other day to be

953
01:00:51,328 --> 01:00:55,958
To be but right now there's you and me

954
01:00:56,048 --> 01:01:00,087
- You and me
- You and me

955
01:01:00,168 --> 01:01:04,798
- You and me
- Right now there's you and

956
01:01:04,888 --> 01:01:08,403
Me

957
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:29,399
What's up, man?

958
01:01:36,208 --> 01:01:37,197
Hi, Troy!

959
01:01:38,288 --> 01:01:40,882
I realised I haven't offered
my congratulations.

960
01:01:41,048 --> 01:01:44,802
Oh, thank you.
I'm glad the season's over, so...

961
01:01:45,008 --> 01:01:48,045
I didn't mean basketball, silly!
I meant Gabriella.

962
01:01:48,128 --> 01:01:49,641
- What?
- Her missing the show

963
01:01:49,728 --> 01:01:54,165
is disappointing, but being selected
for Stanford's Honours Programme,

964
01:01:54,248 --> 01:01:56,716
that is amazing for her
and for East High.

965
01:01:56,808 --> 01:01:59,368
I don't know what you're talking about.

966
01:01:59,448 --> 01:02:02,326
Everyone else does.
The whole school's buzzing.

967
01:02:02,408 --> 01:02:06,242
The honourees spend time with Stanford's
top professors starting next week.

968
01:02:07,088 --> 01:02:08,840
- Next week?
- Look, right there.

969
01:02:09,888 --> 01:02:11,082
You really didn't know?

970
01:02:12,608 --> 01:02:15,361
OK, this is a little awkward.

971
01:02:15,448 --> 01:02:18,599
I guess her not telling you means
that she's on the fence about it.

972
01:02:19,928 --> 01:02:24,285
But who better than Troy Bolton to
encourage her to accept the honour?

973
01:02:24,368 --> 01:02:29,158
Since the only thing possibly holding
her back would be... you.

974
01:02:31,528 --> 01:02:33,803
Well, l'll see you at rehearsal.
Toodles.

975
01:02:49,528 --> 01:02:50,517
Hello?

976
01:02:50,688 --> 01:02:52,565
Hello. Somebody order a pizza pie?

977
01:02:53,528 --> 01:02:56,645
- I didn't order a pizza.
- Special delivery!

978
01:02:59,208 --> 01:03:00,323
Margherita pizza!

979
01:03:02,568 --> 01:03:03,796
Just the way you like it.

980
01:03:04,528 --> 01:03:05,847
Let's not forget,

981
01:03:06,008 --> 01:03:09,762
what's a picnic without
chocolate-covered strawberries?

982
01:03:09,848 --> 01:03:11,076
It wouldn't be right.

983
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:20,320
Do you want the last strawberry?

984
01:03:23,128 --> 01:03:27,326
Come on. This might very well be the
best strawberry in the whole world,

985
01:03:27,408 --> 01:03:29,842
you wouldn't know
because you're not gonna eat it.

986
01:03:31,368 --> 01:03:32,437
Fine, then.

987
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,763
You were right.

988
01:03:45,368 --> 01:03:46,562
So here's the thing.

989
01:03:49,008 --> 01:03:50,805
Your Honours Programme at Stanford...

990
01:03:50,888 --> 01:03:54,676
- How did you hear about that?
- A lot of people heard about it.

991
01:03:54,768 --> 01:03:58,522
But I wasn't one of them. Why?

992
01:03:58,608 --> 01:04:00,599
Because I knew what you would say.

993
01:04:00,768 --> 01:04:03,487
Of course you should do
the Honours Programme.

994
01:04:03,568 --> 01:04:06,958
Is that what you were trying to tell me?
In the backyard the other day?

995
01:04:07,688 --> 01:04:09,007
One of the things.

996
01:04:10,128 --> 01:04:11,163
What else?

997
01:04:11,248 --> 01:04:14,160
I've been thinking about trying
to talk my mom into staying

998
01:04:14,248 --> 01:04:17,797
in Albuquerque another year.
L'll just take some classes here

999
01:04:17,888 --> 01:04:20,118
and go to Stanford when I'm ready.

1000
01:04:20,208 --> 01:04:23,200
You can't just put off something
as amazing as Stanford.

1001
01:04:24,568 --> 01:04:26,365
You got to go.
It's the right thing.

1002
01:04:26,528 --> 01:04:30,567
I always do the right thing. Maybe
I want to be a little crazy this time.

1003
01:04:30,768 --> 01:04:33,885
Everything about my life
has always been full speed ahead.

1004
01:04:34,848 --> 01:04:38,727
I told you, I wish it
would all just slow down...

1005
01:04:39,648 --> 01:04:40,683
...to a stop.

1006
01:04:42,368 --> 01:04:44,279
We're going to graduate.

1007
01:04:44,368 --> 01:04:47,246
That's going to happen.
Nothing is going to slow down.

1008
01:04:50,048 --> 01:04:52,767
I guess my heart just
doesn't know it's in high school.

1009
01:04:56,768 --> 01:04:59,487
You don't have
to say anything else.

1010
01:04:59,568 --> 01:05:02,526
I'm a lot better at goodbyes than you.

1011
01:05:02,608 --> 01:05:04,963
I've had a ton of practice.

1012
01:05:10,808 --> 01:05:12,639
Why are you saying goodbye?

1013
01:05:13,608 --> 01:05:15,997
We still have prom.
We still have to graduate.

1014
01:05:17,408 --> 01:05:18,682
I meant "good night".

1015
01:05:32,928 --> 01:05:35,078
- You OK?
- Yeah.

1016
01:05:37,328 --> 01:05:39,558
- Good night.
- Good night.

1017
01:06:02,128 --> 01:06:05,245
I guess I should've known better

1018
01:06:05,408 --> 01:06:08,878
To believe that my luck had changed

1019
01:06:10,288 --> 01:06:15,237
Oh, I let my heart and forever

1020
01:06:15,368 --> 01:06:18,280
Finally learn each other's name

1021
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:23,845
I tell myself this time it's different

1022
01:06:24,408 --> 01:06:28,526
No goodbyes
'cause I can't bear to say it

1023
01:06:28,608 --> 01:06:33,602
I'd never survive the one that's coming

1024
01:06:33,688 --> 01:06:38,000
If I stay
Oh, no

1025
01:06:38,168 --> 01:06:42,446
Just walk away and don't look back

1026
01:06:42,568 --> 01:06:47,244
'Cause if my heart breaks
it's gonna hurt so bad

1027
01:06:47,328 --> 01:06:52,083
You know I'm strong
but I can't take that

1028
01:06:52,168 --> 01:06:54,921
Before it's too late

1029
01:06:56,088 --> 01:06:58,158
Oh, just walk away

1030
01:06:58,328 --> 01:07:00,637
Walk, walk, walk away

1031
01:07:00,808 --> 01:07:02,844
Oh, just walk away

1032
01:07:03,008 --> 01:07:05,044
Walk, walk, walk away

1033
01:07:05,208 --> 01:07:08,723
Oh, just walk away

1034
01:07:08,808 --> 01:07:12,687
I've got to let it go

1035
01:07:12,848 --> 01:07:17,364
Start protecting my heart and soul

1036
01:07:17,528 --> 01:07:22,648
'Cause I don't think
l'll survive a goodbye again

1037
01:07:23,688 --> 01:07:24,803
Not again

1038
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:29,326
Just walk away
Oh, and don't look back

1039
01:07:29,488 --> 01:07:34,403
'Cause if my heart breaks
it's gonna hurt so bad

1040
01:07:34,568 --> 01:07:38,720
You know I'm strong
but I can't take that

1041
01:07:38,808 --> 01:07:41,800
Before it's too late

1042
01:07:43,928 --> 01:07:45,202
Just walk away

1043
01:07:45,288 --> 01:07:47,756
Walk, walk, walk away

1044
01:07:47,848 --> 01:07:49,918
Walk away, walk away, yeah

1045
01:07:50,048 --> 01:07:52,767
Walk, walk, walk away

1046
01:07:52,848 --> 01:07:55,282
Walk away, walk away

1047
01:07:55,368 --> 01:07:56,960
Walk, walk, walk away

1048
01:07:57,048 --> 01:07:59,482
Walk away, walk away

1049
01:07:59,568 --> 01:08:01,763
Walk, walk, walk away

1050
01:08:01,848 --> 01:08:04,316
Walk away, walk away

1051
01:08:10,408 --> 01:08:13,559
All right, everyone!
Attention, please! Listen up.

1052
01:08:14,248 --> 01:08:18,446
As some of you know, Miss Montez
is no longer available to us.

1053
01:08:18,608 --> 01:08:21,168
However, the show must indeed go on.

1054
01:08:21,328 --> 01:08:24,957
So, Sharpay,
you will do Gabriella's duet with Troy.

1055
01:08:25,048 --> 01:08:27,004
Tiara, ready
to step in for Sharpay?

1056
01:08:27,088 --> 01:08:29,886
Those sparkling shoes
are impossible to fill.

1057
01:08:29,968 --> 01:08:32,198
Don't worry. Kelsi will work with you.

1058
01:08:34,928 --> 01:08:38,887
Come on, people. Let's rise
to the occasion. We're all pros here.

1059
01:08:39,128 --> 01:08:41,084
Let's do it for Gabriella. OK?

1060
01:08:41,848 --> 01:08:44,157
Kelsi, Troy, Ryan. Play piano.

1061
01:08:45,288 --> 01:08:47,324
All right,
we have a lot of work to do.

1062
01:08:47,488 --> 01:08:51,242
There are sets to paint.
Drill that second number. Let's go!

1063
01:08:51,328 --> 01:08:53,080
Come on people, double time!

1064
01:09:13,888 --> 01:09:15,321
- Hey.
- Hey.

1065
01:09:15,488 --> 01:09:17,399
- It's late.
- Yeah.

1066
01:09:20,768 --> 01:09:21,962
Hear from Gabriella?

1067
01:09:22,808 --> 01:09:23,797
Yeah.

1068
01:09:25,048 --> 01:09:27,960
She's knee-deep in geniuses out there.

1069
01:09:28,048 --> 01:09:30,926
Believe it or not, she says
the food's better at East High.

1070
01:09:31,008 --> 01:09:33,647
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1071
01:09:33,728 --> 01:09:35,241
She still coming down for prom?

1072
01:09:36,248 --> 01:09:37,317
Yeah.

1073
01:09:43,048 --> 01:09:44,879
How's that big show going?

1074
01:09:44,968 --> 01:09:46,196
You don't want to know.

1075
01:09:51,768 --> 01:09:54,202
When were you going
to tell me about this?

1076
01:09:55,528 --> 01:09:56,597
Juilliard.

1077
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:00,762
There's nothing to tell.

1078
01:10:02,048 --> 01:10:03,606
Maybe there is.

1079
01:10:03,688 --> 01:10:07,237
I heard you're talking to other schools.
I mean, is this serious?

1080
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:10,445
U of A isn't the only school
that's talked to me. You know that.

1081
01:10:10,608 --> 01:10:12,917
But it's the only school
we talked about.

1082
01:10:13,008 --> 01:10:15,568
Chad would be disappointed
if you changed your mind.

1083
01:10:15,648 --> 01:10:17,206
No, Chad would get over it.

1084
01:10:18,768 --> 01:10:20,042
Would you?

1085
01:10:21,048 --> 01:10:24,040
We've been going to U of A games
since you were a little kid.

1086
01:10:24,128 --> 01:10:26,517
You talked about wearing
a Redhawks uniform.

1087
01:10:26,688 --> 01:10:28,326
But I'm not a little kid anymore.

1088
01:10:29,728 --> 01:10:32,800
You raised me to make my own choices
and I need to make them.

1089
01:10:33,928 --> 01:10:37,125
Not you or Chad or anybody else. Me.

1090
01:10:40,488 --> 01:10:43,400
Troy, come on. Troy!

1091
01:11:44,168 --> 01:11:48,366
The day a door is closed

1092
01:11:48,448 --> 01:11:51,360
The echoes fill your soul

1093
01:11:52,328 --> 01:11:55,957
They won't say which way to go

1094
01:11:56,048 --> 01:11:58,608
Just trust your heart

1095
01:12:00,808 --> 01:12:04,960
To find what you're here for

1096
01:12:05,048 --> 01:12:08,802
Open another door

1097
01:12:08,888 --> 01:12:12,403
But I'm not sure anymore

1098
01:12:12,488 --> 01:12:15,002
It's just so hard

1099
01:12:36,088 --> 01:12:37,726
Voices in my head

1100
01:12:37,888 --> 01:12:41,563
Tell me they know best
Got me on the edge

1101
01:12:41,728 --> 01:12:44,003
They're pushing, pushing
They're pushing

1102
01:12:44,208 --> 01:12:48,167
I know they've got a plan
But the ball's in my hands

1103
01:12:48,248 --> 01:12:52,036
This time it's man to man
I'm driving, fighting inside a

1104
01:12:52,208 --> 01:12:54,802
World that's upside down

1105
01:12:55,048 --> 01:12:56,606
And spinning faster

1106
01:12:56,768 --> 01:13:00,397
What do I do now without you

1107
01:13:00,568 --> 01:13:04,356
I don't know where to go
What's the right team

1108
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:08,802
I want my own thing
So bad I'm going to scream

1109
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:11,277
I can't choose, so confused

1110
01:13:11,448 --> 01:13:15,043
What's it all mean
I want my own dream

1111
01:13:15,208 --> 01:13:17,324
So bad I'm going to scream

1112
01:13:21,488 --> 01:13:25,447
I'm kicking down the walls
I've gotta make 'em fall

1113
01:13:25,608 --> 01:13:28,839
Just break through 'em all
I'm punching, crashing

1114
01:13:28,968 --> 01:13:33,644
I'm gonna fight to find myself
Me and no one else

1115
01:13:33,968 --> 01:13:37,165
Which way, I can't tell
I'm searching, searching

1116
01:13:37,328 --> 01:13:41,799
Can't find the way that I should turn
I should turn right or left

1117
01:13:41,968 --> 01:13:46,041
It's like nothing works without you

1118
01:13:46,208 --> 01:13:50,486
I don't know where to go
What's the right team

1119
01:13:50,568 --> 01:13:54,402
I want my own thing
So bad I'm gonna scream

1120
01:13:54,568 --> 01:13:58,481
I can't choose, so confused
What's it all mean

1121
01:13:58,848 --> 01:14:03,399
I want my own dream
So bad I'm gonna scream

1122
01:14:03,928 --> 01:14:08,319
Yeah, the clock's running down
Hear the crowd gettin' loud

1123
01:14:08,528 --> 01:14:12,157
I'm consumed by the sound
Is it her, is it love

1124
01:14:12,368 --> 01:14:14,120
Can the music ever be enough

1125
01:14:14,288 --> 01:14:16,279
Gotta work it out, gotta work it out

1126
01:14:16,448 --> 01:14:18,598
You can do it, you can do it

1127
01:14:35,928 --> 01:14:38,283
I don't know where to go

1128
01:14:38,368 --> 01:14:40,006
What's the right team?

1129
01:14:40,088 --> 01:14:42,158
I want my own thing

1130
01:14:42,248 --> 01:14:44,284
So bad I'm gonna scream

1131
01:14:44,368 --> 01:14:46,643
I can't choose, so confused

1132
01:14:46,728 --> 01:14:48,559
What's it all mean?

1133
01:14:48,648 --> 01:14:50,286
I want my own dream

1134
01:14:50,368 --> 01:14:52,928
So bad I'm gonna scream

1135
01:15:16,088 --> 01:15:19,080
Miss D?

1136
01:15:19,168 --> 01:15:20,965
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

1137
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:22,527
Aren't you?

1138
01:15:22,608 --> 01:15:25,042
Nor should I be
at this hour I suppose,

1139
01:15:25,128 --> 01:15:28,518
but I am trying to rebalance a show

1140
01:15:28,688 --> 01:15:32,522
in which Sharpay now plays
the role of Miss Montez.

1141
01:15:33,488 --> 01:15:35,285
And the reason for your visit is?

1142
01:15:36,848 --> 01:15:41,239
I don't know. I think I feel
like this is a good place to...

1143
01:15:41,328 --> 01:15:46,163
- Scream? Feel free.
- Or just to think.

1144
01:15:47,088 --> 01:15:51,764
The stage can be a wonderful partner
in the process of self-discovery.

1145
01:15:51,848 --> 01:15:53,566
You seem comfortable up there.

1146
01:15:55,808 --> 01:15:56,797
I do?

1147
01:15:57,768 --> 01:16:02,888
Which is why I submitted an application
in your name to Juilliard.

1148
01:16:03,848 --> 01:16:05,167
It was you.

1149
01:16:05,288 --> 01:16:07,756
Better to consider opportunities now

1150
01:16:07,848 --> 01:16:11,557
than in ten years when life
may limit your choices.

1151
01:16:11,728 --> 01:16:13,480
If I overstepped, I apologise.

1152
01:16:14,368 --> 01:16:16,199
No. No, I'm not mad.

1153
01:16:18,728 --> 01:16:20,127
I'm just confused.

1154
01:16:21,568 --> 01:16:25,004
What a life in the theatre
has taught me is

1155
01:16:25,088 --> 01:16:27,886
to trust one's instincts.

1156
01:16:27,968 --> 01:16:32,678
And that takes courage.
A quality you don't seem to lack.

1157
01:16:38,568 --> 01:16:40,445
Last one out turns off the lights.

1158
01:17:00,328 --> 01:17:02,603
So walk, walk, walk. Jump in.

1159
01:17:02,768 --> 01:17:06,556
Around the world and spin out.
See? You got it.

1160
01:17:06,648 --> 01:17:09,003
- You're easier to dance with than her.
- My turn.

1161
01:17:09,168 --> 01:17:10,840
OK. Here we go. From the top.

1162
01:17:11,048 --> 01:17:13,687
Walk, walk, walk.
Jump down. Around the world.

1163
01:17:13,848 --> 01:17:15,122
Heads up! Heads up!

1164
01:17:17,568 --> 01:17:22,926
All right, everyone. Let's
just take five, all right? Take five.

1165
01:17:23,008 --> 01:17:25,203
You two. House up.

1166
01:17:26,088 --> 01:17:30,684
Hoops Man. Over here. You look like
you're having the time of your life.

1167
01:17:32,328 --> 01:17:36,082
I'm messing up the dances.
I'm messing up all the songs. I'm sorry.

1168
01:17:36,168 --> 01:17:38,557
It's all of us. And all of us
pretty much know why.

1169
01:17:38,648 --> 01:17:42,561
If it wasn't for Gabriella, this musical
would have been another "Sharpay Show".

1170
01:17:44,888 --> 01:17:46,560
- It'll be fine.
- Yeah.

1171
01:18:04,248 --> 01:18:06,523
- Hey, Mama!
- Hi.

1172
01:18:10,328 --> 01:18:11,522
Wow.

1173
01:18:12,968 --> 01:18:14,242
Gorgeous!

1174
01:18:15,328 --> 01:18:18,206
I'd like to take credit,
but Gabriella picked it out.

1175
01:18:18,288 --> 01:18:21,405
I ordered that corsage you showed me.
It's going to be perfect.

1176
01:18:21,568 --> 01:18:22,796
Thanks, Mom.

1177
01:18:22,968 --> 01:18:24,606
- You did good.
- Thank you.

1178
01:18:24,808 --> 01:18:25,923
It's Gabriella.

1179
01:18:27,768 --> 01:18:30,077
Hey! I just showed my mom the tux.

1180
01:18:30,768 --> 01:18:32,042
We need to talk.

1181
01:18:33,968 --> 01:18:37,961
I can't be a little adult right now,
Troy. I'm hoping you understand that.

1182
01:18:38,288 --> 01:18:39,846
No, don't even say that.

1183
01:18:44,648 --> 01:18:46,479
Gabriella. Prom is in two days.

1184
01:18:46,568 --> 01:18:48,718
You're supposed to be
on a plane now.

1185
01:18:48,808 --> 01:18:51,845
It's taking me two weeks
to get used to being away from you.

1186
01:18:52,528 --> 01:18:56,043
- From East High and all my friends.
- I know. I know.

1187
01:18:56,128 --> 01:18:59,643
So, what, I come back,
go to prom and leave again?

1188
01:18:59,728 --> 01:19:01,878
And then it's graduation,
and leave again?

1189
01:19:02,328 --> 01:19:05,286
- That was our plan.
- I don't think I can do it, Troy.

1190
01:19:06,328 --> 01:19:09,923
- I think I've run out of goodbyes.
- Why do you keep saying goodbye?

1191
01:19:12,648 --> 01:19:14,639
I love you, Wildcat.

1192
01:19:14,728 --> 01:19:17,800
But I need to stay
right where I am. I'm sorry.

1193
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:21,116
Gabriella.

1194
01:19:27,248 --> 01:19:28,681
She's not coming back, man.

1195
01:19:30,048 --> 01:19:33,006
- Is she going to miss prom?
- No, she's not coming back at all.

1196
01:19:35,008 --> 01:19:38,125
Wow. That's lousy, man.

1197
01:19:39,968 --> 01:19:41,003
It really is.

1198
01:19:42,248 --> 01:19:43,317
But, hey, man.

1199
01:19:44,808 --> 01:19:48,198
Everybody knows you don't bring
the girl with you after high school.

1200
01:19:49,528 --> 01:19:53,919
Look, Gabriella is already
one step ahead. As usual.

1201
01:19:55,488 --> 01:19:58,639
Right now you got
to snap out of it, dude.

1202
01:19:58,728 --> 01:20:02,926
She's off to Stanford.
And, look, I am right there with you.

1203
01:20:03,008 --> 01:20:07,479
Taylor's heading to Yale.
And you and me are going to U of A.

1204
01:20:09,608 --> 01:20:10,836
It's a new ball game.

1205
01:20:15,648 --> 01:20:18,367
Maybe I don't see my life
as a ball game anymore, man.

1206
01:20:20,448 --> 01:20:21,437
Look.

1207
01:20:23,208 --> 01:20:25,961
You're gonna go to the prom with us,
be with your friends.

1208
01:20:26,168 --> 01:20:29,365
You're gonna have
a good time. All right?

1209
01:20:29,448 --> 01:20:32,804
I don't plan on missing my prom.

1210
01:20:32,888 --> 01:20:34,116
There we go.

1211
01:21:03,448 --> 01:21:05,916
I figured you'd be
the last one out of the building.

1212
01:21:08,728 --> 01:21:09,877
I don't believe this.

1213
01:21:10,648 --> 01:21:12,525
I took a wrong turn on the way to prom.

1214
01:21:13,928 --> 01:21:14,997
So did you.

1215
01:21:16,128 --> 01:21:20,679
You are so crazy, Wildcat.
And what is it with you and trees?

1216
01:21:21,368 --> 01:21:23,757
I guess I see things
more clearly from up here.

1217
01:21:24,728 --> 01:21:26,207
You look handsome.

1218
01:21:27,128 --> 01:21:31,007
Prom is tonight in Albuquerque.
It's a thousand miles away.

1219
01:21:35,448 --> 01:21:37,484
My prom is wherever you are.

1220
01:21:39,488 --> 01:21:43,401
If I'm going to have a last dance
at East High, it's going to be with you.

1221
01:21:48,608 --> 01:21:53,443
Take my hand
l'll take the lead

1222
01:21:53,528 --> 01:21:57,726
And every turn will be safe with me

1223
01:21:58,608 --> 01:22:02,965
Don't be afraid
Afraid to fall

1224
01:22:03,768 --> 01:22:09,126
You know l'll catch you through it all

1225
01:22:09,208 --> 01:22:12,678
- And you can't keep us apart
- Even a thousand miles

1226
01:22:12,888 --> 01:22:14,640
Can't keep us apart

1227
01:22:14,728 --> 01:22:20,041
'Cause my heart is wherever you are

1228
01:22:20,128 --> 01:22:22,164
It's like catching lightning

1229
01:22:22,328 --> 01:22:25,877
The chances of finding someone

1230
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,319
Like you

1231
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:32,164
It's one in a million

1232
01:22:32,368 --> 01:22:34,928
The chances of feeling

1233
01:22:35,048 --> 01:22:38,279
The way we do

1234
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:44,482
And with every step together

1235
01:22:44,728 --> 01:22:49,244
We just keep on getting better

1236
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:54,041
- So can I have this dance?
- Can I have this dance?

1237
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:57,166
Can I have this dance?

1238
01:22:58,768 --> 01:23:04,126
- Can I have this dance?
- This dance

1239
01:23:04,208 --> 01:23:09,328
Can I have this dance?

1240
01:23:36,128 --> 01:23:40,997
You know... I'm not the only one that
changed when you came to East High.

1241
01:23:42,968 --> 01:23:47,519
Kids that I used to just pass in
the hallway... we're friends now.

1242
01:23:47,608 --> 01:23:49,917
And we're supposed
to be doing a show together.

1243
01:23:52,168 --> 01:23:55,285
The problem is, East High
changed when you got there.

1244
01:23:55,368 --> 01:23:57,723
And now it's changed again
because you left.

1245
01:24:01,848 --> 01:24:05,204
You might be ready
to say goodbye to East High,

1246
01:24:05,288 --> 01:24:08,166
but East High's not ready
to say goodbye to you.

1247
01:24:15,328 --> 01:24:18,957
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the final
call for curtain. Find your seats.

1248
01:24:22,608 --> 01:24:25,361
Hey, Mommy and Daddy,
how was Africa? No, I mean India.

1249
01:24:25,648 --> 01:24:28,560
Fabulous.
The show is starting soon.

1250
01:24:29,528 --> 01:24:31,041
You're in the lobby?

1251
01:24:31,128 --> 01:24:33,926
OK. Toodles. And I love the roses!

1252
01:24:37,448 --> 01:24:41,043
Hey, what's up?
We haven't formally met,

1253
01:24:41,128 --> 01:24:43,961
but I feel like I know you
in sort of a vibe-y level.

1254
01:24:44,048 --> 01:24:45,720
I'm Jimmy "The Rocket" Zara.

1255
01:24:46,928 --> 01:24:49,806
"Jimmy The Rocket"? What are you?
A Muppet gangster?

1256
01:24:51,168 --> 01:24:55,446
What is that?
Is that your cologne or a toxic spill?

1257
01:24:55,608 --> 01:24:59,487
Oh, yeah. It's called "Babe Magnet".
Bought it just for the show.

1258
01:24:59,568 --> 01:25:00,557
You like it?

1259
01:25:03,728 --> 01:25:05,081
That is so gross.

1260
01:25:05,168 --> 01:25:07,602
Hello! Send Troy in to see me.
I need to run the song.

1261
01:25:09,968 --> 01:25:13,199
Yo! Dion.
Troy Bolton just sent me a text.

1262
01:25:13,288 --> 01:25:14,767
Probably just checking in.

1263
01:25:15,688 --> 01:25:19,363
"Been driving all night. L'll try
to make it for the second act.

1264
01:25:19,528 --> 01:25:22,520
- Break a leg."
- "Break a leg"? What does that mean?

1265
01:25:22,728 --> 01:25:25,526
Dude, that's show biz
for "you're going on tonight".

1266
01:25:25,608 --> 01:25:26,927
- As Troy?
- Yeah.

1267
01:25:27,008 --> 01:25:28,361
- Onstage?
- Yeah.

1268
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,801
- Oh, no.
- Get it!

1269
01:25:29,888 --> 01:25:34,006
All right. Notify Sharpay. I will take
care of Kelsi and the orchestra.

1270
01:25:34,088 --> 01:25:35,203
Hold up, Miss D.

1271
01:25:36,608 --> 01:25:38,360
I think he stopped breathing.

1272
01:25:38,488 --> 01:25:42,197
Well, then give him the Heimlich!
It's showtime!

1273
01:25:44,448 --> 01:25:46,564
- Go get 'em.
- Come on.

1274
01:25:48,128 --> 01:25:49,686
- Hello, Mrs Evans.
- Hello.

1275
01:25:49,768 --> 01:25:51,247
- Enjoy the show.
- Thank you.

1276
01:25:54,568 --> 01:25:57,878
It's so wonderful, yes.
Seats right here.

1277
01:25:58,088 --> 01:26:00,204
Thank you for coming. Enjoy the show.

1278
01:26:25,408 --> 01:26:30,277
It's our last chance to share the stage

1279
01:26:30,528 --> 01:26:34,680
Before we go our separate ways

1280
01:26:35,128 --> 01:26:39,883
High school wasn't meant to last forever

1281
01:26:43,128 --> 01:26:48,156
It's our last chance for us to shine

1282
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:52,799
To bring you music one more time

1283
01:26:52,968 --> 01:26:55,402
So come on, come on, come on

1284
01:26:55,528 --> 01:26:57,678
Come on, come on, come on

1285
01:26:57,808 --> 01:27:02,120
Come on, come on, come on

1286
01:27:11,848 --> 01:27:16,000
W-l-L-D Wildcats!
You know you're on

1287
01:27:16,168 --> 01:27:20,081
W-l-L-D Wildcats!
Come on, come on

1288
01:27:20,248 --> 01:27:23,206
East High boys
Let's make some noise

1289
01:27:23,328 --> 01:27:27,719
Oh, yeah, W-l-L-D Wildcats!
Now's the time

1290
01:27:31,808 --> 01:27:33,560
This is the last time to get it right

1291
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:35,957
This is the last chance
to make it our night

1292
01:27:36,128 --> 01:27:38,005
We got to show what we're all about

1293
01:27:38,168 --> 01:27:39,760
Work together

1294
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:41,879
This is the last chance to make our mark

1295
01:27:42,048 --> 01:27:43,879
History will know who we are

1296
01:27:44,008 --> 01:27:48,081
This is the last game so make it count
It's now or never

1297
01:27:59,728 --> 01:28:02,037
Entre.

1298
01:28:02,128 --> 01:28:04,688
Good evening, Miss Evans.
Two minutes till places.

1299
01:28:04,848 --> 01:28:07,601
Tell Troy to come up.
I want to rehearse the kissing.

1300
01:28:07,768 --> 01:28:09,724
Hasn't anybody told you that Troy...

1301
01:28:10,568 --> 01:28:12,240
Go!

1302
01:28:13,368 --> 01:28:17,077
I want it all
I want it, I want it, I want it

1303
01:28:17,168 --> 01:28:19,557
I gotta have my star on the door

1304
01:28:19,688 --> 01:28:21,440
I want the world, nothing less

1305
01:28:21,608 --> 01:28:25,681
All the glam and the press
Only giving me the best reviews

1306
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,643
I want it all, want it all, want it all

1307
01:28:28,728 --> 01:28:30,241
He's the choreographer.

1308
01:28:31,288 --> 01:28:32,687
Kick it, girls

1309
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:34,998
I want it all, want it all, want it all

1310
01:28:35,128 --> 01:28:38,359
Want it all, want it all

1311
01:28:38,448 --> 01:28:43,158
We want it all

1312
01:28:43,248 --> 01:28:45,364
My band! Thank you!

1313
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:47,684
East High, you're amazing! Good night.

1314
01:28:49,768 --> 01:28:50,803
Yeah!

1315
01:28:52,048 --> 01:28:53,083
Yeah!

1316
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:56,199
That's my boy!

1317
01:28:58,528 --> 01:29:02,077
We have to save something. I'm at
the balcony, don't forget the special.

1318
01:29:02,168 --> 01:29:06,161
You forget the special. Where's Troy?
OK, he's around here somewhere.

1319
01:29:08,088 --> 01:29:09,965
Cute pants.

1320
01:29:10,048 --> 01:29:11,037
You're on.

1321
01:29:33,448 --> 01:29:37,680
I got a lot of things I have to do

1322
01:29:37,768 --> 01:29:42,364
All these distractions
Our future's coming soon

1323
01:29:42,448 --> 01:29:46,157
We're being pulled
a hundred different directions

1324
01:29:46,328 --> 01:29:48,398
Focus, Jimmy. Come on, man.

1325
01:29:51,168 --> 01:29:53,238
You're on my mind
You're in my heart

1326
01:29:53,328 --> 01:29:55,717
It doesn't matter where we are

1327
01:29:55,888 --> 01:29:57,606
We'll be all right

1328
01:29:57,768 --> 01:30:02,398
Even if we're miles apart

1329
01:30:09,688 --> 01:30:13,203
Even if we're miles apart

1330
01:30:21,408 --> 01:30:25,924
Even if we're miles
and miles and miles apart

1331
01:30:26,928 --> 01:30:28,441
I think we have a problem.

1332
01:30:33,328 --> 01:30:37,116
All I wanna do

1333
01:30:37,208 --> 01:30:39,597
Is be with you

1334
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:42,282
Be with you

1335
01:30:42,448 --> 01:30:45,679
There's nothing we can't do

1336
01:30:45,848 --> 01:30:50,046
Just wanna be with you, only you

1337
01:30:50,208 --> 01:30:53,245
And no matter where life takes us

1338
01:30:53,408 --> 01:30:56,878
Nothing can break us apart

1339
01:30:58,208 --> 01:31:01,166
I just wanna be with...

1340
01:31:02,368 --> 01:31:03,642
You

1341
01:31:05,808 --> 01:31:07,002
Yeah!

1342
01:31:08,488 --> 01:31:09,682
Thank you very much.

1343
01:31:09,768 --> 01:31:12,362
- You rule!
- Best crowd I've ever had.

1344
01:31:13,568 --> 01:31:14,717
Hey!

1345
01:31:15,288 --> 01:31:17,927
Perfect. Go for it.
Save the day. Whoopee!

1346
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,600
What?

1347
01:31:20,688 --> 01:31:22,201
You guys got to see this.

1348
01:31:22,568 --> 01:31:25,446
No, you guys are awesome.
Thank you.

1349
01:31:29,768 --> 01:31:31,042
- They're here!
- Kels!

1350
01:31:33,488 --> 01:31:35,797
- Let's go! You're on!
- Oh, man. Hey!

1351
01:31:38,768 --> 01:31:39,962
That's my dress!

1352
01:31:40,728 --> 01:31:43,447
I had one made just like it.
Only better.

1353
01:31:43,528 --> 01:31:45,519
I'm playing Sharpay, remember?

1354
01:31:47,008 --> 01:31:50,080
You're not a singer.
You're a London schoolgirl.

1355
01:31:50,168 --> 01:31:53,319
Yes. London Academy of Dramatic Arts.

1356
01:31:53,888 --> 01:31:57,847
I took the job with you to learn
the ropes at East High. Now I have.

1357
01:31:57,928 --> 01:32:02,399
Now, step aside. I need to warm up
and give a good first impression.

1358
01:32:02,528 --> 01:32:05,281
Since it will be
my drama department next year.

1359
01:32:06,208 --> 01:32:10,406
But you were so loyal. So sweet.

1360
01:32:10,928 --> 01:32:13,840
That's called acting.
You should try it sometime.

1361
01:32:18,008 --> 01:32:19,236
Toodles.

1362
01:32:22,648 --> 01:32:26,323
You know how life can be
It changes overnight

1363
01:32:26,888 --> 01:32:31,404
It's sunny then raining
but it's all right

1364
01:32:31,528 --> 01:32:33,280
A friend like you

1365
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,478
Always makes it easy

1366
01:32:36,008 --> 01:32:37,600
I know that you get me

1367
01:32:37,768 --> 01:32:39,599
Every time

1368
01:32:40,408 --> 01:32:45,198
Through every up, through every down
You know l'll always be around

1369
01:32:45,368 --> 01:32:50,362
Through anything you can count on me

1370
01:32:51,408 --> 01:32:54,161
All I wanna do

1371
01:32:54,328 --> 01:32:57,286
- That is Troy Bolton.
- Is be with you

1372
01:32:57,888 --> 01:33:00,004
Be with you

1373
01:33:00,448 --> 01:33:03,167
There's nothing we can't do

1374
01:33:03,728 --> 01:33:08,483
Just wanna be with you, only you

1375
01:33:08,568 --> 01:33:11,082
No matter where life takes us

1376
01:33:11,288 --> 01:33:14,883
Nothing can break us apart

1377
01:33:15,048 --> 01:33:19,564
You know it's true
I just wanna be with you

1378
01:33:25,368 --> 01:33:27,643
I just wanna be with you

1379
01:33:27,728 --> 01:33:29,923
The sun will always shine

1380
01:33:30,088 --> 01:33:32,522
That's how you make me feel

1381
01:33:32,688 --> 01:33:34,804
We're gonna be all right

1382
01:33:35,008 --> 01:33:37,203
'Cause what we have is real

1383
01:33:37,368 --> 01:33:41,077
And we will always be together

1384
01:33:41,168 --> 01:33:44,843
All I wanna do

1385
01:33:44,968 --> 01:33:47,243
Is be with you

1386
01:33:47,328 --> 01:33:49,967
Be with you

1387
01:33:50,048 --> 01:33:53,324
There's nothing we can't do

1388
01:33:53,408 --> 01:33:57,845
Just wanna be with you, only you

1389
01:33:57,928 --> 01:34:00,840
No matter where life takes us

1390
01:34:00,928 --> 01:34:04,364
Nothing can break us apart

1391
01:34:04,448 --> 01:34:05,847
You know it's true

1392
01:34:05,928 --> 01:34:09,125
I just wanna be with you

1393
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:12,768
All I wanna do

1394
01:34:12,928 --> 01:34:17,160
All that I wanna do is be with you

1395
01:34:17,288 --> 01:34:21,839
All that I wanna do is be with you

1396
01:34:21,928 --> 01:34:26,160
All that I wanna do is be with you

1397
01:34:26,288 --> 01:34:28,722
All that I wanna do

1398
01:34:28,848 --> 01:34:30,839
I just wanna be with you

1399
01:34:44,448 --> 01:34:48,521
Sharpay Evans, I believe
you're in the wrong costume.

1400
01:34:53,848 --> 01:34:57,397
Who's that girl?
She's so fine

1401
01:34:57,568 --> 01:35:00,719
Who's that girl?
I don't recognise

1402
01:35:00,888 --> 01:35:04,119
Who's that girl?
She looks so good, yeah

1403
01:35:04,288 --> 01:35:07,803
Guess you never really noticed
but you probably should

1404
01:35:07,928 --> 01:35:11,079
Big fun
On the night of nights

1405
01:35:11,488 --> 01:35:13,763
The night of nights
Tonight

1406
01:35:14,568 --> 01:35:18,163
Let's dance
On the night of nights

1407
01:35:18,288 --> 01:35:20,358
You know we're gonna do it right

1408
01:35:20,568 --> 01:35:22,843
- It's gonna be our night
- You know it

1409
01:35:23,048 --> 01:35:24,606
- To remember
- For all time

1410
01:35:24,728 --> 01:35:26,605
Surprise. Big fun

1411
01:35:27,328 --> 01:35:29,603
- It's gonna be the night
- We love it

1412
01:35:29,808 --> 01:35:31,958
- To last forever
- The rest of our lives

1413
01:35:32,168 --> 01:35:34,841
We'll never ever ever forget
It's gonna be...

1414
01:35:35,008 --> 01:35:36,566
- My night
- Oh, yeah

1415
01:35:36,728 --> 01:35:38,480
- All together
- Say it loud

1416
01:35:38,648 --> 01:35:40,798
Come on now
Everyone, that's right

1417
01:35:40,968 --> 01:35:43,277
- It's gonna be a night
- You can bet

1418
01:35:43,368 --> 01:35:45,438
- To remember
- Hear the crowd

1419
01:35:45,608 --> 01:35:48,247
And never ever ever, never ever ever

1420
01:35:48,408 --> 01:35:51,241
Never ever never ever ever forget

1421
01:36:06,688 --> 01:36:08,838
- Thank you so much.
- It was such a great show.

1422
01:36:08,928 --> 01:36:10,646
See them out, please.
Thank you.

1423
01:36:24,648 --> 01:36:29,517
Together, together, together, everyone

1424
01:36:29,608 --> 01:36:33,203
Together, together, come on
Let's have some fun

1425
01:36:33,368 --> 01:36:36,246
Ladies and gentlemen! Our seniors!

1426
01:36:40,248 --> 01:36:45,242
Kelsi Nielsen, the Juilliard School
Scholarship Recipient.

1427
01:36:45,328 --> 01:36:46,317
Music.

1428
01:36:50,088 --> 01:36:51,999
Jason Cross.

1429
01:36:53,328 --> 01:36:55,398
You did it. You graduated.

1430
01:37:01,008 --> 01:37:06,082
Taylor McKessie, Yale University,
with honours, Political Science.

1431
01:37:07,088 --> 01:37:09,044
And I am pleased to announce that due

1432
01:37:09,168 --> 01:37:11,841
to the excellence
displayed here this evening,

1433
01:37:12,008 --> 01:37:15,239
the Juilliard School has made
an extraordinary decision.

1434
01:37:15,568 --> 01:37:20,119
Another senior is being offered
a Juilliard scholarship.

1435
01:37:20,208 --> 01:37:24,759
Congratulations, Mr Ryan Evans,
Choreography.

1436
01:37:28,648 --> 01:37:31,367
And congratulations,
Miss Sharpay Evans.

1437
01:37:31,528 --> 01:37:34,565
University of Albuquerque,
Performing Arts.

1438
01:37:34,688 --> 01:37:38,203
Miss Evans has agreed
to return to East High next fall

1439
01:37:38,368 --> 01:37:41,565
to assist me in running
the Drama Department.

1440
01:37:43,488 --> 01:37:48,278
And now a senior
who I believe has a decision to make.

1441
01:37:48,568 --> 01:37:51,446
Mr Troy Bolton. Troy.

1442
01:37:58,608 --> 01:38:00,166
I've chosen basketball.

1443
01:38:01,928 --> 01:38:03,919
But I've also chosen theatre.

1444
01:38:11,568 --> 01:38:15,447
The University of California,
Berkeley, offers me both.

1445
01:38:15,528 --> 01:38:17,996
That's where I'm going
to be attending next fall.

1446
01:38:20,608 --> 01:38:25,079
But most of all, I choose
the person who inspires my heart.

1447
01:38:26,448 --> 01:38:30,964
Which is why I picked
a school that's exactly 32.7...

1448
01:38:32,168 --> 01:38:33,317
...miles from you.

1449
01:38:36,008 --> 01:38:41,002
Miss Gabriella Montez,
Stanford University, Pre-Law.

1450
01:38:48,368 --> 01:38:50,882
Next, Mr Chad Danforth.

1451
01:38:51,048 --> 01:38:54,961
University of Albuquerque,
Basketball Scholarship!

1452
01:38:55,568 --> 01:38:56,683
He's gone.

1453
01:38:58,928 --> 01:39:00,839
Mr Danforth.

1454
01:39:16,968 --> 01:39:18,959
He goes up for the shot and it's good!

1455
01:39:19,048 --> 01:39:21,437
East High Wildcat victory
for the record books!

1456
01:39:30,288 --> 01:39:32,802
Once they hand us that diploma,
we're done here?

1457
01:39:32,888 --> 01:39:35,243
What makes you think
we're getting diplomas?

1458
01:39:39,448 --> 01:39:43,327
One question: Does Berkeley play?

1459
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:47,481
Oh, yeah. We're scheduled to kick
some Redhawk butt next November.

1460
01:39:49,768 --> 01:39:51,042
Game on, Hoops.

1461
01:39:56,008 --> 01:39:58,886
One more steal. The final point.

1462
01:40:00,968 --> 01:40:04,404
Danforth! Bolton!
You get out there and you get onstage!

1463
01:40:04,728 --> 01:40:06,719
I never thought I'd hear
my dad say that.

1464
01:40:20,688 --> 01:40:24,363
We're all in this together

1465
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:26,279
Once we know

1466
01:40:26,408 --> 01:40:28,717
That we are
We're all stars

1467
01:40:28,888 --> 01:40:30,401
And we see that

1468
01:40:30,488 --> 01:40:34,083
East High is a place where teachers
encouraged us to break the status quo.

1469
01:40:35,088 --> 01:40:37,522
And define ourselves as we choose.

1470
01:40:38,448 --> 01:40:41,326
Where a jock can cook up
a mean crme brle.

1471
01:40:43,048 --> 01:40:46,324
And the brainiac
can break down on the dance floor.

1472
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:55,446
It's a place where one person...
if it's the right person...

1473
01:41:00,168 --> 01:41:01,601
...changes us all.

1474
01:41:03,448 --> 01:41:06,838
East High is having friends that
we'll keep for the rest of our lives.

1475
01:41:08,448 --> 01:41:11,599
And I guess that means we
really are all in this together.

1476
01:41:14,128 --> 01:41:15,766
Because once a Wildcat...

1477
01:41:17,048 --> 01:41:18,879
...always a Wildcat.

1478
01:41:19,928 --> 01:41:22,283
- Yeah, man.
- Thank you!

1479
01:41:29,688 --> 01:41:32,202
Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.

1480
01:42:09,848 --> 01:42:12,760
Looking forward from centre stage
to graduation day

1481
01:42:12,928 --> 01:42:14,964
Time to get the future started

1482
01:42:15,128 --> 01:42:18,803
What we leave what we take with us
No matter what

1483
01:42:18,888 --> 01:42:22,927
It's something we're a part of
We learned to fly

1484
01:42:23,008 --> 01:42:25,317
Together side by side

1485
01:42:26,408 --> 01:42:29,605
I just hope the rest of my life

1486
01:42:30,608 --> 01:42:31,757
Will feel as good as my

1487
01:42:31,888 --> 01:42:37,246
High School Musical
Who says we have to let it go?

1488
01:42:37,328 --> 01:42:39,558
It's the best part we've ever known

1489
01:42:39,768 --> 01:42:41,884
Step into the future

1490
01:42:41,968 --> 01:42:45,438
But hold on to High School Musical

1491
01:42:45,608 --> 01:42:48,168
Let's celebrate where we come from

1492
01:42:48,528 --> 01:42:52,441
The friends who've been there all along
Just like

1493
01:42:53,888 --> 01:42:57,085
A High School Musical

1494
01:43:00,008 --> 01:43:03,364
Improvisation without a script
No one's written it

1495
01:43:03,568 --> 01:43:05,365
And now we have the chance to

1496
01:43:05,528 --> 01:43:08,918
But some day we'll be looking back
Memories we'll have

1497
01:43:09,088 --> 01:43:11,283
All the songs that we lived through

1498
01:43:11,368 --> 01:43:15,805
The best of times
So why leave them behind

1499
01:43:16,848 --> 01:43:20,045
Why can't the rest of my life

1500
01:43:21,008 --> 01:43:24,557
Be like my
High School Musical?

1501
01:43:24,728 --> 01:43:27,083
Who says we have to let it go?

1502
01:43:27,648 --> 01:43:30,003
It's the best part we've ever known

1503
01:43:30,088 --> 01:43:32,158
Step into the future

1504
01:43:32,248 --> 01:43:35,957
But hold on to High School Musical

1505

Let's celebrate where we come from

1506
01:43:38,808 --> 01:43:42,437
The friends who've been there all along
That's right

1507
01:43:44,808 --> 01:43:47,447
Now we finally realise

1508
01:43:47,528 --> 01:43:49,758
Who we are
It just took some time

1509
01:43:50,168 --> 01:43:53,478
We had to live
and to learn to see the truth

1510
01:43:54,048 --> 01:43:55,879
Learn to see the truth

1511
01:43:56,048 --> 01:44:00,963
That nothing's ever impossible
Into the future we all free fall

1512
01:44:01,488 --> 01:44:04,048
But forever
we'll always have high school

1513
01:44:07,768 --> 01:44:09,838
Time to party now
Celebrate

1514
01:44:10,528 --> 01:44:12,723
Because the world's one big stage

1515
01:44:12,888 --> 01:44:15,766
Any part you want can be yours

1516
01:44:16,568 --> 01:44:17,967
Everybody sing

1517
01:44:18,968 --> 01:44:21,528
But the show is never going to close

1518
01:44:21,608 --> 01:44:23,838
It's what got us here we know

1519
01:44:24,168 --> 01:44:28,002
High school lives on forever more

1520
01:44:28,968 --> 01:44:34,645

- Oh, yeah

All together, makes it better

1536
01:45:17,008 --> 01:45:19,522
Memories that last forever

1537
01:45:19,728 --> 01:45:24,722
I want the rest of my life
to feel just like a

1538
