2
00:00:04,502 --> 00:00:10,741
# in a world without tears #

3
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:19,007
# how would bruises
find a face to lie upon? #

4
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:29,059
# how would scars find skin
to etch themselves into? #

5
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:35,432

find the bones? #

00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:43,874

without tears #

7
00:00:43,875 --> 00:00:52,082

8
00:00:52,083 --> 00:00:56,053
# how would blood know #

9
00:00:56,054 --> 00:01:01,859
# which body
to flow outside of? #

10
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,365
# how would bullets find
the guns? #

11
00:01:08,366 --> 00:01:16,373
# if we lived in a world
without tears, #

12
00:01:16,374 --> 00:01:21,111
# how would misery know #

13
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:24,581
# which back door
to walk through? #

14
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:34,858
# how would trouble know
which mind to live inside of? #

15
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:41,165
# how would sorrow find
a home? #

16
00:01:42,801 --> 00:01:50,908
# if we lived in a world
without tears, #

17
00:01:50,909 --> 00:01:59,249
# how would bruises find

18
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:09,026

19
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:16,299

20
00:02:59,544 --> 00:03:01,077
Mrs. Pope?

21
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,248
Tom.

22
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:06,817
Tommy Wills.

23
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:08,352
How are you?

24
00:03:08,353 --> 00:03:09,520
I'm good.

25
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,888
Oh, gosh,
it's good to see you.

26
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,590
What brings you to town?

27
00:03:13,591 --> 00:03:15,559
I'm just visiting my folks
for a few days.

28
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,060
Hi, there.

29
00:03:17,061 --> 00:03:18,862
Hey. Mrs. Pope, I want
to introduce you to my wife.

30
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:19,896
This is Linda.

31
00:03:19,897 --> 00:03:21,198
Hi.
- Maggie.

32
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,232
Nice
to meet you.

33
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:23,300
Nice to meet you.

34
00:03:23,301 --> 00:03:25,669
Congratulations.
I heard about the wedding.

35
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,304
Oh, thank you.

36
00:03:27,305 --> 00:03:28,706
So how do you all
know each other?

37
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,341
Well--

38
00:03:30,342 --> 00:03:32,409
Um, Tom knew my son.

39
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,910
Oh, do I know him?

40
00:03:33,911 --> 00:03:35,846
No.

41
00:03:37,849 --> 00:03:39,216
<i>Help me!</i>

42
00:03:39,217 --> 00:03:40,351
<i>Help me.</i>

43
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:41,752
Stay back.
Stay back.

44
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:43,220
<i>Give her space.</i>

45
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:44,321
Watch her head.

46
00:03:44,322 --> 00:03:45,489
Someone,
call 911.

47
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:47,391
<i>Hold her head up.</i>
<i>Hold her head.</i>

48
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:49,926
<i>Call 911 now!</i>

49
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:51,628
<i>It's okay;</i>
<i>hold her head up.</i>

50
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:55,699
Yes, we need an ambulance
at Glen Owl Market.

51
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,435
<i>There's a girl</i>
<i>having a seizure.</i>

52
00:03:58,436 --> 00:04:00,237
<i>Okay.</i>
<i>All right.</i>

53
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:01,238
<i>There she goes.</i>

54
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:02,439
<i>Just take deep breaths.</i>

55
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,674
<i>Honey, you're doing</i>
<i>just fine.</i>

56
00:04:03,675 --> 00:04:04,908
<i>Are they coming?</i>

57
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:07,578
<i>They're on their way.</i>

58
00:04:54,158 --> 00:04:55,492
She got in here

59
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:57,428
before I had a chance to see
what they dropped off.

60
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:59,095
I'm going
to find Hope.

61
00:04:59,096 --> 00:05:00,697
I don't know
where the hell she is,

62
00:05:00,698 --> 00:05:02,299
but I'm gonna find her,
I swear to you.

63
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:03,700
Let's try this
one more time.

64
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:04,768
Where is she?

65
00:05:04,769 --> 00:05:07,170
I don't know
where Hope is.

66
00:05:09,373 --> 00:05:12,175
Come on, Red.

67
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:13,644
<i>It's me.</i>

68
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:15,879
I told you
everything I know.

69
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,414
Okay, Carl, untie him.

70
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,584
Let the man have a drink.

71
00:05:28,827 --> 00:05:31,662
Thank you.

72
00:05:31,663 --> 00:05:33,229
Can I have a smoke?

73
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,298
Well, I don't see
why not.

74
00:05:47,378 --> 00:05:49,746
Okay, tough guy.

75
00:05:52,149 --> 00:05:53,750
Where is she?

76
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:26,449
Baby sister,

77
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,785
There's never going to be
a better time to sell.

78
00:06:28,786 --> 00:06:31,187
I don't want to sell.

79
00:06:31,188 --> 00:06:33,156
Look, there's a window
of opportunity right now.

80
00:06:33,157 --> 00:06:34,758
It's my home.

81
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:37,594
I raised my family there.

82
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:39,095
John Stanton
at the bank says

83
00:06:39,096 --> 00:06:41,164
that that road
is going to come through.

84
00:06:41,165 --> 00:06:45,869
And he's got a developer
who will pay us cash tomorrow

85
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,337
if we sell together.

86
00:06:47,338 --> 00:06:50,240
I don't know why we're talking
about this again.

87
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:53,744
You do what you want
with your part.

88
00:06:53,745 --> 00:06:55,979
Mary Margaret,
make sense.

89
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:59,016
I mean, that development's
going to happen

90
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:00,183
whether we like it
or not.

91
00:07:00,184 --> 00:07:03,620
I am going to sell
my half.

92
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:06,690
But we can get triple
if we both sell.

93
00:07:10,294 --> 00:07:13,363
Is this what you want
or what Nancy Kaye wants?

94
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:18,835
It's what we both want.

95
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:24,641
Look, I'm just trying to do
what's best for you,

96
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:26,843
what's best
for all of us.

97
00:07:26,844 --> 00:07:30,614
Think about moving
where me and Nancy Kaye live.

98
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:33,050
I mean, there's
a great subdivision.

99
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:37,520
Got three-bedroom houses
with central air and a pool.

100
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:40,523
It's manageable, honey.

101
00:07:40,524 --> 00:07:42,492
And you might meet
somebody.

102
00:07:44,996 --> 00:07:47,464
How long's it been
since you danced?

103
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:53,804
Do you remember
when you loved to dance?

104
00:07:53,805 --> 00:07:56,172
I don't want to sell,
George.

105
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:57,207
<i>Hoo-hoo!</i>

106
00:07:58,509 --> 00:07:59,509
Look who's here.

107
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,844
<i>Howdy hi.</i>

108
00:08:00,845 --> 00:08:03,113
<i>The prices down here</i>
<i>are so cheap.</i>

109
00:08:03,114 --> 00:08:05,082
You two got finished
with your little talk?

110
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,883
I don't like getting involved
in discussions

111
00:08:06,884 --> 00:08:08,051
involving money.

112
00:08:08,052 --> 00:08:09,419
I don't have a head
for finances,

113
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,922
do I, Georgie?

114
00:08:11,923 --> 00:08:13,724
Oh, Maggie,
you look tired.

115
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:15,025
You know what you need?

116
00:08:15,026 --> 00:08:17,027
Let me see.
A manicure.

117
00:08:17,028 --> 00:08:19,997
Oh, yeah,
brighten up your day.

118
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:21,098
Hey, you know what?

119
00:08:21,099 --> 00:08:22,198
We got to get going

120
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:23,867
if we're going to get
to clogging tonight.

121
00:08:23,868 --> 00:08:25,168
We got to practice.

122
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:28,005
These trophies just don't
win themselves, you know.

123
00:08:28,006 --> 00:08:29,439
Well, come on.
Up and at 'em.

124
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:35,812
Think about it,
pumpkin.

125
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:39,516
I'm just thinking
about your interest.

126
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,822
You know, we really ought
to do these little lunches

127
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,358
more than once
every couple months.

128
00:08:48,359 --> 00:08:49,392
Really.

129
00:08:49,393 --> 00:08:51,128
Come on, Georgie.
Bye-bye.

130
00:08:51,129 --> 00:08:53,063
Good-bye.

131
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:02,039
Hope!

132
00:09:23,961 --> 00:09:26,563
My mom says
I have to go with you.

133
00:09:34,304 --> 00:09:37,507
Come on; we got to go now.

134
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:40,009
<i>Let's go!</i>

135
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:51,588
What happened to your face?

136
00:09:56,994 --> 00:09:58,795
Where are we going?

137
00:10:06,904 --> 00:10:11,408
<i>...in Memphis, Tennessee,</i>
<i>home of the cave.</i>

138
00:10:24,588 --> 00:10:26,823
Why are we stopping?

139
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:40,870
Hang on, kid.

140
00:12:40,024 --> 00:12:42,491
Wake up.

141
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:47,496
I'm hungry.

142
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:57,874
<i> Hey, it's Hope.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

143
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,676
Beep!

144
00:12:59,677 --> 00:13:03,345
Where are you?

145
00:13:33,443 --> 00:13:36,112
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

146
00:13:37,247 --> 00:13:38,414
You're doin' it.

147
00:13:38,415 --> 00:13:40,083
What the fuck are you doing?
Give me that.

148
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,117
No!

149
00:13:41,118 --> 00:13:43,419
Give that to me!
- No!

150
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:56,332
God damn it.

151
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:07,110
Shit.

152
00:14:07,111 --> 00:14:09,245
Pretend like you're sick.

153
00:14:09,246 --> 00:14:11,580
I think I am.

154
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:16,085
License and registration,
please.

155
00:14:16,086 --> 00:14:17,854
Just a sec, Officer.

156
00:14:25,696 --> 00:14:28,631
You must be
in one hell of a rush.

157
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:29,666
Kid's sick.

158
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:31,367
I got to get him
to a doctor.

159
00:14:31,368 --> 00:14:34,236
What happened
to your face?

160
00:14:34,237 --> 00:14:37,073
Well, it's--

161
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:39,542
It's a long story...

162
00:14:39,543 --> 00:14:41,544
Jennifer.

163
00:14:41,545 --> 00:14:44,013
Hi, Billy.
- Hi.

164
00:14:45,716 --> 00:14:47,717
Nice uniform.

165
00:14:47,718 --> 00:14:49,552
What brings you home?

166
00:14:51,055 --> 00:14:53,790
Just need a little vacation.

167
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:54,891
You still in Detroit?

168
00:14:54,892 --> 00:14:56,125
No, Memphis.

169
00:14:56,126 --> 00:14:57,160
Wow.

170
00:14:57,161 --> 00:14:58,561
Just playing
with my band.

171
00:14:58,562 --> 00:14:59,929
How's that going?

172
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,733
It's going good.
It's great.

173
00:15:03,734 --> 00:15:06,836
Who's your friend?

174
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:08,270
<i>This is Clayton.</i>

175
00:15:08,271 --> 00:15:09,538
I know his mom.

176
00:15:09,539 --> 00:15:11,708
I'm keeping him
for a while.

177
00:15:11,709 --> 00:15:12,975
Hi, Clayton.

178
00:15:12,976 --> 00:15:15,078
Hi.

179
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:16,545
How long you around?

180
00:15:18,082 --> 00:15:22,785
Oh, couple days.

181
00:15:22,786 --> 00:15:24,754
How you been?

182
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:27,023
Good.

183
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:31,828
Well, I guess
I ought to let you go.

184
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:33,896
Clayton, tell this guy
if he doesn't stop speeding,

185
00:15:33,897 --> 00:15:35,598
he's going to have
to let you do the driving

186
00:15:35,599 --> 00:15:37,499
from now on.

187
00:15:41,371 --> 00:15:43,572
Maybe I'll see you
while I'm here.

188
00:15:43,573 --> 00:15:46,075
Yeah, maybe.

189
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,180
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

190
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:52,949
<i>I said, "act sick."</i>

191
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,150
You sounded
like you were having a baby.

192
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:12,168
Filter
for your tractor.

193
00:16:12,169 --> 00:16:13,269
Oh, thanks, Roy.

194
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,703
Could you check
my oil?

195
00:16:14,704 --> 00:16:16,739
The engine's been running
a little hot lately.

196
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:19,842
You bet.

197
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:22,511
Want to pop the hood?

198
00:16:22,512 --> 00:16:25,181
Oh.

199
00:16:25,182 --> 00:16:27,083
I'm going to get a coke.
You want one?

200
00:16:27,084 --> 00:16:29,118
No, thanks.

201
00:16:36,226 --> 00:16:38,995
Do I need any?

202
00:16:38,996 --> 00:16:41,998
Uh, no.
It's good.

203
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:43,800
Thanks, Roy.

204
00:16:43,801 --> 00:16:45,467
Put it on my bill.

205
00:16:45,468 --> 00:16:47,503
<i>Okay.</i>

206
00:17:34,017 --> 00:17:36,052
Yoo-hoo!

207
00:17:36,053 --> 00:17:38,120
Billy?

208
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,897
<i>Hey.</i>

209
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:49,031
I was watching that.

210
00:17:50,767 --> 00:17:52,201
Billy?

211
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,476
Billy, what are you doing here?

212
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:02,144
<i>Why didn't you tell me</i>

213
00:18:02,145 --> 00:18:03,812
you were coming?

214
00:18:03,813 --> 00:18:05,047
Hi, Mom.

215
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:07,750
Who's that little boy
in the living room?

216
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:10,586
Got any of that pimento cheese
you used to make?

217
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,788
<i>No, I don't make it</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

218
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:14,257
You were the only one
who ate it.

219
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:17,093
If I'd known you were coming,
I could have made some.

220
00:18:17,094 --> 00:18:19,828
Billy, who is that boy?

221
00:18:19,829 --> 00:18:21,697
That's Clayton.

222
00:18:21,698 --> 00:18:23,165
I'm keeping him
for a while.

223
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:26,903
That doesn't really answer
my question.

224
00:18:26,904 --> 00:18:30,606
What happened
to the cedar tree out front?

225
00:18:30,607 --> 00:18:31,807
It was struck by lightning.

226
00:18:31,808 --> 00:18:33,609
Billy.

227
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,643
What is with you?

228
00:18:34,644 --> 00:18:36,712
Will you look at me?

229
00:18:45,055 --> 00:18:47,023
What happened?

230
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:48,357
Nothing. I'm just trying
to make a sandwich.

231
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,159
I'm starving.

232
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,294
Excuse me.

233
00:18:51,295 --> 00:18:53,529
I haven't heard from you
in over a year,

234
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,132
and you show up
with a banged-up face and a kid,

235
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,100
and I'm not supposed
to ask any questions?

236
00:18:58,101 --> 00:19:00,303
Sorry to inconvenience you.

237
00:19:00,304 --> 00:19:02,871
I just need a place to stay
for a couple days.

238
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:03,872
Is that okay?

239
00:19:03,873 --> 00:19:05,774
This is your home too.

240
00:19:05,775 --> 00:19:07,609
It always has been.

241
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:08,644
Better put something on that.

242
00:21:40,330 --> 00:21:43,098
She said I was supposed
to wake you up for supper.

243
00:22:09,025 --> 00:22:11,093
Are you going
someplace?

244
00:22:11,094 --> 00:22:12,261
Yeah, I got
to go out.

245
00:22:12,262 --> 00:22:13,796
I got stuff to do.

246
00:22:13,797 --> 00:22:17,065
Billy.

247
00:22:17,066 --> 00:22:19,902
Can you watch
the kid?

248
00:22:19,903 --> 00:22:21,537
Sure.

249
00:22:21,538 --> 00:22:22,871
Thank you.

250
00:22:22,872 --> 00:22:24,740
<i>I'll be back later.</i>

251
00:22:29,546 --> 00:22:32,080
You can stay in here.

252
00:22:35,251 --> 00:22:36,919
I'll be downstairs
if you need me.

253
00:23:38,214 --> 00:23:39,348
<i>...thanks to surgery</i>

254
00:23:39,349 --> 00:23:41,350
at the hospital
for sick children.

255
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:49,057
Your TV sucks.

256
00:23:49,058 --> 00:23:51,193
Then why are you watching it?

257
00:23:51,194 --> 00:23:54,196
There's nothing else to do.

258
00:23:54,197 --> 00:23:56,665
Why don't you read a book?

259
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,701
Don't have one.

260
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:03,866
<i>It's been a long time coming.</i>

261
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:05,534
<i>I'm determined,</i>

262
00:25:05,535 --> 00:25:07,235
more than ever this time.

263
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:12,374
<i>And I know it won't be easy,</i>
<i>but I have a baby now.</i>

264
00:25:12,375 --> 00:25:13,576
And...

265
00:25:13,577 --> 00:25:15,878
<i>I got to do it.</i>

266
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:18,547
I'm Tanya,
and I'm an alcoholic.

267
00:25:18,548 --> 00:25:20,816
Thanks for sharing, Tanya.

268
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:27,523
Is there anyone else
who'd like to share?

269
00:25:32,496 --> 00:25:34,530
No, I'll pass.

270
00:25:36,132 --> 00:25:37,299
Okay, then.

271
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,735
<i>Well, let's join hands.</i>

272
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:47,776
Whose father?

273
00:25:47,777 --> 00:25:49,011
Our father,

274
00:25:49,012 --> 00:25:52,381
who art in heaven,
hallowed by thy name.

275
00:25:52,382 --> 00:25:54,316
Thy kingdom come.

276
00:25:54,317 --> 00:25:57,920
Thy will be done on earth
as it is in heaven.

277
00:25:57,921 --> 00:26:00,756
Give us this day
our daily bread,

278
00:26:00,757 --> 00:26:02,424
and forgive us our trespasses

279
00:26:02,425 --> 00:26:06,028
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

280
00:26:06,029 --> 00:26:08,497
How often you go?

281
00:26:08,498 --> 00:26:10,499
Not so much anymore.

282
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,367
First year,
I went religiously.

283
00:26:12,368 --> 00:26:15,070
Now I just go
when I need to.

284
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:16,839
Yeah, me too.

285
00:26:18,975 --> 00:26:22,377
What happened
to New York?

286
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:24,413
I thought you were going
to be on Broadway.

287
00:26:25,782 --> 00:26:27,816
Yeah, so did I.

288
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:29,117
I went.

289
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:32,655
I waitressed for two years
before my dad got sick.

290
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:34,557
None of my brothers
were around anymore,

291
00:26:34,558 --> 00:26:38,093
so I came home
to take care of him.

292
00:26:38,094 --> 00:26:40,629
That was ten years ago.

293
00:26:42,566 --> 00:26:45,968
You ever wish
you'd gone back?

294
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:47,903
Not really.

295
00:26:47,904 --> 00:26:52,274
I'm good at what I do,
and I like it here, so...

296
00:26:54,578 --> 00:26:57,580
How long you been sober?

297
00:26:57,581 --> 00:26:59,281
A long time.

298
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:01,316
Wasn't so much I had
a problem, you know.

299
00:27:01,317 --> 00:27:03,919
It was more about
where I was headed.

300
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,921
You know how it is.

301
00:27:05,922 --> 00:27:08,724
Yeah, I do know
how it is.

302
00:27:11,194 --> 00:27:13,161
How long
you really been sober?

303
00:27:13,162 --> 00:27:14,997
<i>Billy!</i>

304
00:27:14,998 --> 00:27:16,899
Hey, man,
is that you?

305
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:17,833
Rick?

306
00:27:17,834 --> 00:27:19,668
Hey, hey, rock star!

307
00:27:19,669 --> 00:27:21,103
Hey, man.
How you been doing?

308
00:27:22,171 --> 00:27:23,205
Sorry, man.

309
00:27:23,206 --> 00:27:25,741
I haven't seen you
since forever.

310
00:27:25,742 --> 00:27:28,344
I know.
How's Donny?

311
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:30,579
He died.

312
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,580
What?

313
00:27:31,581 --> 00:27:32,648
Yeah, you didn't hear?

314
00:27:32,649 --> 00:27:33,682
He died, man.

315
00:27:33,683 --> 00:27:35,384
Drove his truck
off a bridge.

316
00:27:35,385 --> 00:27:37,786
Man, he was wasted.

317
00:27:37,787 --> 00:27:41,056
Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

318
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:42,157
That must have
wrecked Shelly.

319
00:27:42,158 --> 00:27:44,393
Oh, man,
it was brutal.

320
00:27:44,394 --> 00:27:46,428
I mean, she got two kids,
and one of 'em is his,

321
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:50,065
So, you know,
it's rough, man.

322
00:27:50,066 --> 00:27:52,901
Hey, you want to--you want
to go grab a drink?

323
00:27:52,902 --> 00:27:55,137
You want to get a beer
or something, man?

324
00:27:55,138 --> 00:27:56,204
Man, I can't.

325
00:27:56,205 --> 00:27:57,873
Maybe later.

326
00:27:57,874 --> 00:28:01,143
Oh, I got you.

327
00:28:01,144 --> 00:28:04,112
Police business, huh?

328
00:28:04,113 --> 00:28:05,981
See you, Billy.

329
00:28:05,982 --> 00:28:08,817
Always nice to see you
outside the squad car, Rick.

330
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:40,916
<i>What time is it?</i>

331
00:28:40,917 --> 00:28:42,284
It's late.

332
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:44,252
Where've you been?

333
00:28:44,253 --> 00:28:49,325
I had some things
I needed to take care of.

334
00:28:49,326 --> 00:28:51,427
You smell like a bar.

335
00:28:51,428 --> 00:28:54,262
<i>He's not</i>

336
00:28:54,263 --> 00:28:55,230
A stray dog, Billy.

337
00:28:58,468 --> 00:28:59,835
What?

338
00:28:59,836 --> 00:29:02,538
He's not one of those strays
you used to bring home.

339
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:04,640
What are you talking about?

340
00:29:04,641 --> 00:29:10,278
The ones that I ended up
taking care of.

341
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:14,149
Turn out the lights
before you come up.

342
00:29:28,998 --> 00:29:31,199
<i>Billy, where are you?</i>

343
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,534
I'm in my mom's house.

344
00:29:32,535 --> 00:29:33,635
Look, Beth,
I just need to know

345
00:29:33,636 --> 00:29:35,371
if you've heard anything
from Hope.

346
00:29:35,372 --> 00:29:37,406
<i>I haven't heard anything</i>
<i>since she blew out of here.</i>

347
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:40,609
Well, do you have any idea
where she could be?

348
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:41,677
<i>I have no idea.</i>

349
00:29:41,678 --> 00:29:46,348
<i>I thought she was with you.</i>

350
00:29:46,349 --> 00:29:47,983
She never checked in.

351
00:29:47,984 --> 00:29:49,785
I mean, if I don't hear from her
in the next couple of days,

352
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:53,722
then maybe I'll just--
I don't know--go back there.

353
00:29:53,723 --> 00:29:55,056
<i>You can't come back.</i>

354
00:29:55,057 --> 00:29:57,192
<i>Red's been asking</i>
<i>a lot of questions.</i>

355
00:29:57,193 --> 00:29:58,427
He's going to fucking kill you.

356
00:29:58,428 --> 00:29:59,995
Hold on a second.

357
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:01,363
Could you stop?

358
00:30:01,364 --> 00:30:03,665
<i>Do something else?</i>
<i>Bzzz?</i>

359
00:30:05,535 --> 00:30:06,769
What kind of questions?

360
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:09,271
<i>Where you are,</i>
<i>where Hope is.</i>

361
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:11,072
<i>Billy, I don't want</i>
<i>to be involved.</i>

362
00:30:11,073 --> 00:30:12,674
<i>Last night, Leo called,</i>

363
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:15,143
<i>and Red had me lie for him</i>
<i>and say he wasn't there.</i>

364
00:30:15,144 --> 00:30:17,145
Uh, yeah, I get it.
I get it.

365
00:30:17,146 --> 00:30:19,381
Um, well,
that's great.

366
00:30:19,382 --> 00:30:20,482
What are the dates,
again?

367
00:30:20,483 --> 00:30:22,584
<i>Billy?</i>

368
00:30:22,585 --> 00:30:25,287
Yeah, no, I'm available, sure.

369
00:30:25,288 --> 00:30:26,288
<i>Billy?</i>

370
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:27,389
Shit, I need the work.

371
00:30:27,390 --> 00:30:28,490
<i>Is Clayton with you?</i>

372
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:29,691
Okay, well, great.

373
00:30:29,692 --> 00:30:31,259
I understand.
<i>Listen to me--</i>

374
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,861
<i> Well, thank you.</i>
<i>I'll see you then.</i>

375
00:30:32,862 --> 00:30:35,431
Okay, thank you.
<i>- Billy!</i>

376
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:38,300
Fucking idiot.

377
00:30:42,505 --> 00:30:44,406
I'll be back before supper.

378
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:46,809
<i>Okay.</i>

379
00:30:46,810 --> 00:30:48,510
Clayton?

380
00:30:48,511 --> 00:30:50,178
Run and get a clean shirt.

381
00:30:53,716 --> 00:30:55,317
You don't have one?

382
00:30:55,318 --> 00:30:57,285
Mm-mm.

383
00:30:57,286 --> 00:30:58,420
I saw you had a bag.

384
00:30:58,421 --> 00:31:00,255
Don't you have
any clothes in it?

385
00:31:00,256 --> 00:31:01,824
No.

386
00:31:01,825 --> 00:31:03,391
Do you have a toothbrush?

387
00:31:03,392 --> 00:31:05,393
Mm-mm.

388
00:31:13,470 --> 00:31:16,505
Might help
if you use this.

389
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:27,516
What's in there?

390
00:31:30,052 --> 00:31:33,221
We don't go in there.

391
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:26,642
<i> If you know how to fix</i>
<i>a tractor,</i>

392
00:32:26,643 --> 00:32:28,877
I could sure use some help.

393
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:50,599
Hi.

394
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,067
What are you doing here?

395
00:32:52,068 --> 00:32:55,971
Just thought I'd stop by
and say hi.

396
00:32:55,972 --> 00:32:57,940
Okay.

397
00:33:07,483 --> 00:33:09,117
So what's wrong?

398
00:33:11,387 --> 00:33:14,289
I need to find someone.

399
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:17,559
Who are you looking for?

400
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:20,896
The kid I'm with,
I need to find his mother.

401
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:25,601
Well, have you tried
her friends, family?

402
00:33:25,602 --> 00:33:27,402
No one knows where she is.

403
00:33:27,403 --> 00:33:31,239
Does she have a husband
or a boyfriend?

404
00:33:33,343 --> 00:33:35,844
What about the boy's father?

405
00:33:44,887 --> 00:33:47,456
Why doesn't Billy look like you?

406
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:49,424
'cause he looks like his father.

407
00:33:49,425 --> 00:33:50,625
Why did you name him Billy?

408
00:33:50,626 --> 00:33:51,793
<i>'Cause his father's name</i>
<i>was that</i>

409
00:33:51,794 --> 00:33:54,096
and his father before him.

410
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:55,663
Hey, could you get
the jumper cables?

411
00:33:55,664 --> 00:33:57,665
Sure.

412
00:34:04,140 --> 00:34:06,308
Where are they?

413
00:34:06,309 --> 00:34:09,344
Oh, they died
a long time ago.

414
00:34:11,547 --> 00:34:13,748
My mom goes to work every day.

415
00:34:13,749 --> 00:34:15,417
Where does she work?

416
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,818
Hooters.

417
00:34:16,819 --> 00:34:18,286
Oh!

418
00:34:18,287 --> 00:34:20,522
She's a dancer.

419
00:34:20,523 --> 00:34:22,090
<i>Is that right?</i>

420
00:34:22,091 --> 00:34:23,125
Mm-hmm.

421
00:34:23,126 --> 00:34:25,593
Okay, now,
take this cable,

422
00:34:25,594 --> 00:34:27,095
and put it
right in there.

423
00:34:28,464 --> 00:34:30,332
<i>Attaboy.</i>

424
00:34:39,642 --> 00:34:42,010
Haven't seen one of these
in a while.

425
00:34:42,011 --> 00:34:43,412
'68?

426
00:34:43,413 --> 00:34:45,514
That's right.

427
00:34:45,515 --> 00:34:47,549
What can I do for you?

428
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,617
Brakes keep on slipping.

429
00:34:49,618 --> 00:34:51,319
Let's have a look.

430
00:35:09,338 --> 00:35:12,574
Boy, she's walked a mile.

431
00:35:12,575 --> 00:35:14,242
She still plays good.

432
00:35:14,243 --> 00:35:15,577
I'm kind of partial to her.

433
00:35:17,913 --> 00:35:19,448
You're Maggie pope's boy,
aren't you?

434
00:35:20,883 --> 00:35:22,350
You know my mom?

435
00:35:22,351 --> 00:35:23,751
I'm Roy Long.

436
00:35:23,752 --> 00:35:25,320
Billy.

437
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:30,692
Yeah, I got some buddies
I play with.

438
00:35:30,693 --> 00:35:33,228
We're not very good,
but we have fun.

439
00:35:33,229 --> 00:35:34,696
<i>Car's ready.</i>

440
00:35:34,697 --> 00:35:36,264
<i>Just needed some fluid.</i>

441
00:35:38,634 --> 00:35:40,302
What do I owe you?

442
00:35:40,303 --> 00:35:41,803
Just brake fluid.

443
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:43,238
Five bucks
ought to cover it.

444
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:50,712
Come back on Sunday,

445
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:51,879
<i>2:00.</i>

446
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,282
<i>We can always use</i>
<i>another player.</i>

447
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,491
Hop in the truck,
Clayton.

448
00:36:02,492 --> 00:36:04,759
I'll be right back.

449
00:36:12,201 --> 00:36:14,035
Get out of the back, Clayton.

450
00:36:14,036 --> 00:36:15,703
Get out of the back!

451
00:36:15,704 --> 00:36:17,038
Why?

452
00:36:17,039 --> 00:36:18,039
Thud!

453
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,073
Come on. Come on. Come on.

454
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:20,142
Get out.

455
00:36:20,143 --> 00:36:21,610
Because I said so;
that's why.

456
00:36:21,611 --> 00:36:22,910
Get out!
- I can do it myself.

457
00:36:38,093 --> 00:36:41,029
I'm sorry, Clayton.

458
00:37:06,589 --> 00:37:09,090
<i>What are you doing in here?</i>

459
00:37:09,091 --> 00:37:10,925
Nothin'.

460
00:37:10,926 --> 00:37:14,396
Is that your shirt?

461
00:37:14,397 --> 00:37:16,731
No.

462
00:37:16,732 --> 00:37:17,765
Where'd you get it?

463
00:37:17,766 --> 00:37:19,634
Maggie gave it to me.

464
00:37:23,439 --> 00:37:26,675
Soup's on.

465
00:37:39,788 --> 00:37:41,323
Did you wash
your hands?

466
00:37:41,324 --> 00:37:42,591
Yeah.

467
00:37:42,592 --> 00:37:44,826
With soap?

468
00:37:44,827 --> 00:37:46,595
Mm-hmm.

469
00:37:46,596 --> 00:37:48,730
Let me see.

470
00:37:52,201 --> 00:37:53,968
Scoot.

471
00:37:55,471 --> 00:37:57,305
What are you laughing at?

472
00:37:59,542 --> 00:38:01,976
Go wash.

473
00:38:08,884 --> 00:38:10,184
<i>"Scoot.</i>
<i>Wash your hands."</i>

474
00:38:10,185 --> 00:38:12,153
Wash your hands.

475
00:38:12,154 --> 00:38:14,088
<i>I'm washing 'em.</i>

476
00:38:15,991 --> 00:38:18,393
<i>If she asks you if you washed</i>
<i>your hands from now on,</i>

477
00:38:18,394 --> 00:38:19,494
<i>you just say, "yes."</i>

478
00:38:19,495 --> 00:38:21,396
<i>Stop hogging the water.</i>

479
00:38:21,397 --> 00:38:23,431
<i>Relax.</i>

480
00:38:23,432 --> 00:38:26,000
Oh, wait.

481
00:38:26,001 --> 00:38:28,570
Here. Here.

482
00:38:33,342 --> 00:38:34,542
<i>Okay?</i>

483
00:38:34,543 --> 00:38:37,979
<i>Hold on. Here.</i>

484
00:38:40,015 --> 00:38:41,849
<i>Let me see.</i>

485
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:44,519
<i>Other side.</i>

486
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:50,692
He's yours, isn't he?

487
00:38:59,034 --> 00:39:00,402
Does he know?

488
00:39:02,305 --> 00:39:03,938
I don't think so.

489
00:39:15,618 --> 00:39:17,652
Why didn't you tell me?

490
00:39:17,653 --> 00:39:22,256
I just found out
just a couple days ago.

491
00:39:22,257 --> 00:39:26,994
His mother's got some problems
that she needs to figure out.

492
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,108
So I'm a grandmother.

493
00:39:42,678 --> 00:39:43,811
<i>Clayton?</i>

494
00:39:43,812 --> 00:39:44,812
Is that--

495
00:39:44,813 --> 00:39:46,113
<i>Clayton!</i>

496
00:39:46,114 --> 00:39:47,215
Where have you been?

497
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:49,150
Where is he?
Where is he?

498
00:39:49,151 --> 00:39:50,151
<i>Where is he?</i>

499
00:39:50,152 --> 00:39:52,453
Hope, calm down.

500
00:39:52,454 --> 00:39:53,488
What the fuck
are you looking at?

501
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:54,955
What is she looking at?

502
00:39:54,956 --> 00:39:56,857
<i>Oh, no.</i>

503
00:39:56,858 --> 00:39:58,426
Where is my son, huh?

504
00:39:58,427 --> 00:39:59,494
Clayton!

505
00:39:59,495 --> 00:40:00,695
<i>Where have you been?</i>

506
00:40:00,696 --> 00:40:01,696
How'd you even find me?

507
00:40:01,697 --> 00:40:02,763
Beth told me.

508
00:40:02,764 --> 00:40:04,031
Could you have made it
any fucking harder,

509
00:40:04,032 --> 00:40:05,266
out here in the middle
of nowhere?

510
00:40:05,267 --> 00:40:06,801
<i>Made it any harder?</i>

511
00:40:06,802 --> 00:40:08,303
You disappeared!
I've been calling you.

512
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:10,071
Clayton?

513
00:40:10,072 --> 00:40:11,472
Where is he?

514
00:40:11,473 --> 00:40:13,541
Hope, look,
we got to talk, okay?

515
00:40:15,744 --> 00:40:17,044
I'm calling the police!

516
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:18,279
Look, Mom.

517
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,280
Please, wait.

518
00:40:19,281 --> 00:40:20,815
Mom, wait.
- Clayton!

519
00:40:20,816 --> 00:40:22,049
I'm calling the police.

520
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:23,618
Mom, hang up the phone.

521
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:25,520
Mom! Mom!

522
00:40:25,521 --> 00:40:27,822
Clayton.
Oh, baby.

523
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:29,924
Oh, oh.

524
00:40:29,925 --> 00:40:31,392
Did you do what mama
told you to do?

525
00:40:31,393 --> 00:40:32,427
Yes, Mama.

526
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:33,828
You're a good boy, baby.
Good boy.

527
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:34,895
Come on, baby.
Let's go.

528
00:40:34,896 --> 00:40:36,231
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

529
00:40:36,232 --> 00:40:37,365
Let's go.

530
00:40:37,366 --> 00:40:38,566
You ain't taking him.

531
00:40:38,567 --> 00:40:39,900
Let go of him!
Let go!

532
00:40:39,901 --> 00:40:40,901
<i>You're high!</i>

533
00:40:40,902 --> 00:40:42,169
<i>You're totally fucking high!</i>

534
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,170
You ain't taking him anywhere.

535
00:40:44,573 --> 00:40:47,074
Oh, shit.
Okay.

536
00:40:47,075 --> 00:40:49,210
Jesus fucking Christ, Hope.

537
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,947
Baby, listen.

538
00:40:52,948 --> 00:40:54,582
Mama's going to come back
for you, okay, okay?

539
00:40:54,583 --> 00:40:55,683
I got to take care
of a couple things.

540
00:40:55,684 --> 00:40:57,585
All right?

541
00:40:57,586 --> 00:40:59,120
<i> No, no, no,</i>
<i>you ain't going nowhere.</i>

542
00:40:59,121 --> 00:41:00,521
<i>Mom!</i>

543
00:41:00,522 --> 00:41:02,123
Get off me!

544
00:41:02,124 --> 00:41:03,190
<i>Hold on a second.</i>

545
00:41:03,191 --> 00:41:04,759
<i>You understand</i>
<i>what you've done?</i>

546
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,860
You're not leaving
with that.

547
00:41:05,861 --> 00:41:06,927
Let go of me!

548
00:41:06,928 --> 00:41:09,096
I can't let you leave
with that shit.

549
00:41:09,097 --> 00:41:10,231
Stop it!
Give me the bag!

550
00:41:13,335 --> 00:41:15,970
Don't worry about Red, okay?

551
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,538
I got it all figured out.

552
00:41:17,539 --> 00:41:18,706
Okay?

553
00:41:20,809 --> 00:41:22,677
Jesus Christ, Hope.

554
00:41:22,678 --> 00:41:24,178
<i>Mom!</i>

555
00:41:27,583 --> 00:41:29,751
Mom!

556
00:41:29,752 --> 00:41:32,487
Hey, Mom, don't leave me!

557
00:41:37,225 --> 00:41:39,727
Mom!

558
00:42:39,888 --> 00:42:41,656
<i> Hey, it's Hope.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

559
00:42:41,657 --> 00:42:43,324
Beep!

560
00:42:43,325 --> 00:42:44,659
Billy?

561
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:46,227
What?

562
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:47,428
Where are you going?

563
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:49,230
I'm going to find
Clayton's mother.

564
00:42:49,231 --> 00:42:50,732
<i>And what are you</i>
<i>going to do with him?</i>

565
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:52,567
I don't know.
I'll figure it out.

566
00:42:52,568 --> 00:42:54,669
Oh, and that's
your rock-solid plan?

567
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,337
Fine; I'll take him
with me.

568
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:57,372
Oh, and then what?

569
00:42:57,373 --> 00:42:58,506
Give him back to the woman

570
00:42:58,507 --> 00:43:00,341
Who came to pick up drugs
from her kid?

571
00:43:00,342 --> 00:43:01,976
<i>There was a mountain</i>

572
00:43:01,977 --> 00:43:03,344
of drugs on my floor, Billy.

573
00:43:03,345 --> 00:43:04,345
They weren't mine.

574
00:43:04,346 --> 00:43:05,446
You could go to jail.

575
00:43:05,447 --> 00:43:07,081
I said
that they weren't mine!

576
00:43:07,082 --> 00:43:08,549
If this is the way
it's going to be

577
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:11,519
with you home, I'd rather
you not be here at all.

578
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,754
I won't go through this
again!

579
00:43:12,755 --> 00:43:15,390
Fine.
You won't have to.

580
00:43:46,555 --> 00:43:47,622
Hey, man.

581
00:43:47,623 --> 00:43:49,089
Rick.

582
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,357
How you doing?

583
00:43:50,358 --> 00:43:53,027
Good.
Good.

584
00:43:53,028 --> 00:43:54,529
Can I buy you a beer?

585
00:43:54,530 --> 00:43:56,297
It's kind of early.

586
00:43:56,298 --> 00:43:58,332
Oh, hell, man.

587
00:43:58,333 --> 00:44:00,935
Beer don't know
what time it is.

588
00:44:04,005 --> 00:44:06,707
Loretta,
can we get two more?

589
00:44:08,376 --> 00:44:11,679
Good to see you.

590
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,180
Thank you.

591
00:44:13,181 --> 00:44:14,882
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

592
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:16,383
Hey.

593
00:44:16,384 --> 00:44:19,119
It's been too long.

594
00:44:30,265 --> 00:44:32,399
Maybe some other time,
Rick.

595
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:26,287
Frank, play something.

596
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:31,358
Sounds good.

597
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:33,661
Okay.

598
00:45:33,662 --> 00:45:35,063
Hey.

599
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:36,097
Come on in.

600
00:45:36,098 --> 00:45:38,265
<i>Sit down.</i>

601
00:45:38,266 --> 00:45:40,168
Grab a guitar,
if you feel like it.

602
00:45:41,937 --> 00:45:42,970
Okay.

603
00:45:59,254 --> 00:46:01,923
# come with me. #

604
00:46:03,792 --> 00:46:08,029
# come with me. #

605
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:12,600
# let me take you away #

606
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:16,303
# from the madness you see. #

607
00:46:16,304 --> 00:46:25,412
# come with me. #

608
00:46:25,413 --> 00:46:30,151
# let me show you a place #

609
00:46:30,152 --> 00:46:35,656
# where your heart
can run free #

610
00:46:35,657 --> 00:46:39,426
# if you come with me. #

611
00:46:44,666 --> 00:46:50,471
# baby, come with me. #

612
00:47:31,246 --> 00:47:33,147
I thought you were asleep.

613
00:47:34,817 --> 00:47:35,883
You hungry?

614
00:47:35,884 --> 00:47:38,552
Little bit.

615
00:47:38,553 --> 00:47:40,487
I can make you some eggs.

616
00:48:00,542 --> 00:48:03,277
Earlier when I said I--

617
00:48:03,278 --> 00:48:05,646
<i>I--I didn't--</i>

618
00:48:05,647 --> 00:48:07,114
I didn't mean that.

619
00:48:07,115 --> 00:48:10,151
Those weren't my drugs.

620
00:48:14,289 --> 00:48:15,522
Whose were they?

621
00:48:19,394 --> 00:48:22,196
They were Red's.

622
00:48:22,197 --> 00:48:23,731
He's a dealer.

623
00:48:23,732 --> 00:48:25,399
Hope took them from him,

624
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,969
and he thinks I'm in on it.

625
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:30,137
Are you?

626
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:35,376
No.

627
00:48:38,113 --> 00:48:40,647
Is he dangerous?

628
00:48:40,648 --> 00:48:44,618
Not as dangerous
as the people he works for.

629
00:48:44,619 --> 00:48:46,354
Billy.

630
00:48:46,355 --> 00:48:49,556
How did you get mixed up
with these people?

631
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:00,467
How are you?

632
00:49:00,468 --> 00:49:01,802
<i>I don't know anything!</i>

633
00:49:01,803 --> 00:49:03,237
Stop!

634
00:49:11,646 --> 00:49:12,780
I'll fucking kill you.

635
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:14,115
Where are they?

636
00:49:14,116 --> 00:49:16,683
I--I don't know.

637
00:49:35,804 --> 00:49:37,138
Where'd you get that hat?

638
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:44,011
Take it off.

639
00:49:44,012 --> 00:49:45,312
What?

640
00:49:45,313 --> 00:49:46,547
I said take it off.

641
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:47,548
You can't make me.

642
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:48,716
Take it off.

643
00:49:48,717 --> 00:49:49,984
<i>If I tell you to--</i>

644
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,122
Asshole.

645
00:50:15,543 --> 00:50:18,379
What are you doing?

646
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:24,051
It's what I do when I'm trying
to sort things out.

647
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:29,290
Want to try it?

648
00:50:40,769 --> 00:50:44,071
You done?

649
00:50:44,072 --> 00:50:45,807
Now what?

650
00:50:45,808 --> 00:50:48,976
Now you just think
about it.

651
00:50:56,151 --> 00:50:57,785
Nothing's happening.

652
00:50:57,786 --> 00:51:00,521
Shh.

653
00:51:00,522 --> 00:51:02,723
You have to be patient.

654
00:51:08,363 --> 00:51:11,365
Now just let it go.

655
00:51:13,068 --> 00:51:15,636
That's all?

656
00:51:15,637 --> 00:51:17,438
That's all.

657
00:52:05,653 --> 00:52:07,989
<i>Nice family.</i>

658
00:52:07,990 --> 00:52:10,424
Which one's Billy?

659
00:52:10,425 --> 00:52:11,959
Who are you?

660
00:52:14,963 --> 00:52:16,330
I'm a friend.

661
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:19,000
He's not here.

662
00:52:21,703 --> 00:52:23,337
Yes, he is.

663
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:53,700
<i>Your mother's</i>
<i>a very attractive lady.</i>

664
00:52:56,238 --> 00:52:57,571
<i>I saw the--</i>

665
00:52:57,572 --> 00:52:58,672
I saw the boy.

666
00:52:58,673 --> 00:53:00,107
Where's Hope?

667
00:53:00,108 --> 00:53:01,309
She took off.

668
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:02,743
She left him with me.

669
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:03,877
Look, I don't know
where Hope is,

670
00:53:03,878 --> 00:53:05,079
so what do you want
from me?

671
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,880
I want you to find her

672
00:53:06,881 --> 00:53:08,849
so things don't have
to get ugly.

673
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,251
<i>He said he doesn't know.</i>

674
00:53:10,252 --> 00:53:13,220
Ma'am, I can think
of a hundred thousand reasons

675
00:53:13,221 --> 00:53:14,922
that he should find out.

676
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:19,160
You got one day.

677
00:53:19,161 --> 00:53:21,162
I'm going to get you
your stuff back, I swear.

678
00:53:21,163 --> 00:53:22,496
If you don't...

679
00:53:24,132 --> 00:53:26,500
I will be the least
of your problems.

680
00:53:30,138 --> 00:53:31,738
Have a nice day, ma'am.

681
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:33,240
It's a nice place
you got here.

682
00:53:33,241 --> 00:53:35,576
I'm at the Red Roof.

683
00:53:41,616 --> 00:53:42,649
Mom.

684
00:53:42,650 --> 00:53:45,353
<i>Mom.</i>

685
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:13,714
Hey.

686
00:54:13,715 --> 00:54:14,815
<i>Hey.</i>

687
00:54:14,816 --> 00:54:16,150
Where is she?

688
00:54:16,151 --> 00:54:17,951
Sit down, Billy.

689
00:54:17,952 --> 00:54:18,986
I have some bad news.

690
00:54:22,324 --> 00:54:23,757
Is this her car?

691
00:54:38,507 --> 00:54:40,274
Is she dead?

692
00:54:50,585 --> 00:54:53,054
She suffer?

693
00:54:53,055 --> 00:54:56,257
She died on impact.

694
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:59,960
I don't think she felt anything.

695
00:54:59,961 --> 00:55:02,229
I'm so sorry, Billy.

696
00:56:03,391 --> 00:56:05,926
What are you doing?

697
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:08,262
Building a house.

698
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:12,966
Who's Andy?

699
00:56:15,337 --> 00:56:19,273
He's my other son.

700
00:56:23,445 --> 00:56:24,745
Where's he?

701
00:56:26,314 --> 00:56:29,016
He died.

702
00:56:30,552 --> 00:56:31,885
How?

703
00:56:31,886 --> 00:56:35,356
An accident.

704
00:56:35,357 --> 00:56:38,792
Have you ever been to Mexico?

705
00:56:40,995 --> 00:56:42,429
I haven't.

706
00:56:45,099 --> 00:56:47,668
My mom and I
are moving there.

707
00:56:47,669 --> 00:56:50,771
That sounds
like an adventure.

708
00:56:55,443 --> 00:56:57,545
I bet it's beautiful there.

709
00:56:57,546 --> 00:56:59,380
Gonna live on the ocean,

710
00:56:59,381 --> 00:57:02,115
go scuba diving every day.

711
00:57:03,285 --> 00:57:06,453
Oh, Clayton,
they don't fit that way.

712
00:57:06,454 --> 00:57:07,988
This is not the way it works.

713
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:10,558
<i>You're not supposed</i>
<i>to mix them.</i>

714
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:12,493
Why not?

715
00:57:12,494 --> 00:57:15,563
Well, it just doesn't work
that way.

716
00:57:24,673 --> 00:57:26,073
See?

717
00:57:26,074 --> 00:57:28,209
Works all sorts of ways.

718
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:33,013
<i>I'll just put this here.</i>

719
00:57:35,684 --> 00:57:36,750
I guess it does.

720
00:58:20,629 --> 00:58:22,229
<i>What are you looking for?</i>

721
00:58:22,230 --> 00:58:23,297
<i>Oh!</i>

722
00:58:23,298 --> 00:58:25,799
You scared the hell out of me.

723
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,335
It's not there, Billy.
It's been confiscated.

724
00:58:28,336 --> 00:58:30,471
You think those are my drugs?

725
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:31,838
Were they?

726
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,507
No.
<i>- Come on, Billy.</i>

727
00:58:33,508 --> 00:58:34,675
Well, arrest me, then.

728
00:58:34,676 --> 00:58:36,810
<i>Looking at me like that.</i>

729
00:58:36,811 --> 00:58:38,479
Come on, Jennifer;
arrest me, then.

730
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:44,117
Fuck.

731
00:58:52,193 --> 00:58:54,828
<i>Well, look</i>
<i>what the cat drug in.</i>

732
00:59:01,636 --> 00:59:03,904
Can I ask you a question?

733
00:59:03,905 --> 00:59:04,905
Shoot.

734
00:59:04,906 --> 00:59:06,540
You got kids?

735
00:59:06,541 --> 00:59:09,610
Four of 'em.

736
00:59:09,611 --> 00:59:12,078
Where are they?

737
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:13,514
All over.

738
00:59:16,184 --> 00:59:18,084
Talk to 'em?

739
00:59:18,085 --> 00:59:21,655
They don't talk to me.

740
00:59:23,558 --> 00:59:25,892
<i>Hell, I don't blame them.</i>

741
00:59:25,893 --> 00:59:27,328
Time was, I wouldn't talk
to me either.

742
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:34,702
How's your mom?

743
00:59:36,571 --> 00:59:39,306
She's fine.

744
00:59:39,307 --> 00:59:41,375
She seeing anybody?

745
00:59:41,376 --> 00:59:43,009
My mother?

746
00:59:46,013 --> 00:59:48,849
I'm not sure.

747
00:59:50,151 --> 00:59:52,486
Well, I got to make a run
to the parts store.

748
01:00:18,713 --> 01:00:25,018
I'm not very good
at this kind of thing.

749
01:00:25,019 --> 01:00:32,959
Never really
taken it seriously before.

750
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:37,030
<i>Well, I thought you all</i>
<i>were just crazy.</i>

751
01:00:37,031 --> 01:00:40,267
But truth is, you just--

752
01:00:40,268 --> 01:00:43,370
You're asking me to do
something I don't want to do,

753
01:00:43,371 --> 01:00:50,377
and that's to look at myself.

754
01:00:50,378 --> 01:00:55,081
And, well, I'm just afraid
of that truth.

755
01:00:55,082 --> 01:00:59,185
So...

756
01:00:59,186 --> 01:01:00,721
I don't want to look at it.

757
01:01:00,722 --> 01:01:06,026
I lie to people,
and I run.

758
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:15,035
As far as I run,
as fast as I go,

759
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:18,605
I end up staying
in the same place.

760
01:01:25,279 --> 01:01:29,182
Anyway, my name's Billy,
and this is my second meeting.

761
01:01:29,183 --> 01:01:32,352
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for letting me share.</i>

762
01:01:55,677 --> 01:01:57,010
All right, Clayton.

763
01:01:57,011 --> 01:01:59,279
I'll be right back.

764
01:02:05,954 --> 01:02:06,987
Oh, excuse me!

765
01:02:06,988 --> 01:02:09,122
Hi.
- Hi, Roy.

766
01:02:09,123 --> 01:02:10,958
Beautiful day, huh?

767
01:02:10,959 --> 01:02:11,959
Yes.

768
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,361
He--he spent the night
at the station.

769
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:16,630
What?

770
01:02:16,631 --> 01:02:17,631
<i>Billy.</i>

771
01:02:17,632 --> 01:02:19,299
After his AA meeting.

772
01:02:19,300 --> 01:02:21,935
Oh.

773
01:02:21,936 --> 01:02:23,637
Guess he just needed
a place to crash.

774
01:02:23,638 --> 01:02:26,473
I figured you'd want to know
he was okay.

775
01:02:26,474 --> 01:02:31,645
Well, thank you
for looking out for him.

776
01:02:32,814 --> 01:02:35,248
He's come by, you know,
played with us.

777
01:02:35,249 --> 01:02:36,817
He's good.

778
01:02:36,818 --> 01:02:39,820
Taught us old boys
a few tricks.

779
01:02:41,022 --> 01:02:44,024
Well, I expect
you've got things to do.

780
01:02:45,527 --> 01:02:47,360
Maybe you'd like
to come by sometime,

781
01:02:47,361 --> 01:02:48,529
hear us play.

782
01:02:48,530 --> 01:02:51,532
I'd like that.

783
01:02:52,767 --> 01:02:54,067
Good to see you.

784
01:02:54,068 --> 01:02:55,536
Yeah.

785
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:01,742
Hi.

786
01:03:01,743 --> 01:03:04,044
Here.

787
01:03:04,045 --> 01:03:06,246
Thanks.

788
01:03:06,247 --> 01:03:07,681
You want some sugar?

789
01:03:07,682 --> 01:03:09,516
Sure.

790
01:03:09,517 --> 01:03:12,819
I know you think I'm a fuck-up.

791
01:03:12,820 --> 01:03:15,789
<i>And maybe I am.</i>

792
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:18,025
Hope's gone.

793
01:03:18,026 --> 01:03:20,326
<i>I got this kid,</i>

794
01:03:20,327 --> 01:03:21,595
and I don't know
how I'm going to tell him

795
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:23,096
that she's not coming back.

796
01:03:25,567 --> 01:03:27,935
I don't think you're a fuck-up.

797
01:03:35,142 --> 01:03:36,443
Hey, Jennifer.

798
01:03:40,414 --> 01:03:42,382
<i>Hey, boys, Jennifer!</i>

799
01:03:42,383 --> 01:03:44,451
<i>Get in the truck!</i>

800
01:04:11,613 --> 01:04:15,248
You can talk about it
if you want to.

801
01:04:15,249 --> 01:04:17,350
I was there too, you know.

802
01:04:47,314 --> 01:04:48,615
It's been a pleasure.

803
01:04:48,616 --> 01:04:50,216
Thank you.

804
01:04:58,593 --> 01:04:59,759
Clayton?

805
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:02,729
Clayton, lock the doors.

806
01:05:02,730 --> 01:05:05,298
I'll be right back.

807
01:05:10,972 --> 01:05:12,572
Click!

808
01:05:50,044 --> 01:05:51,511
For me?

809
01:05:51,512 --> 01:05:54,614
Yes, it's for you.

810
01:05:58,019 --> 01:06:02,355
Try not to drip.

811
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,261
I'm coming.

812
01:06:08,262 --> 01:06:10,129
Hold on a second.

813
01:06:16,136 --> 01:06:17,370
Well, well, well.

814
01:06:17,371 --> 01:06:19,039
Come on in.

815
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:21,541
Come on.

816
01:06:24,912 --> 01:06:29,282
The thing is--

817
01:06:29,283 --> 01:06:31,084
The thing is,
I don't have your money.

818
01:06:31,085 --> 01:06:37,356
Red, I don't have
the drugs, 'cause--

819
01:06:37,357 --> 01:06:39,225
'cause Hope's dead.

820
01:06:39,226 --> 01:06:41,661
She drove off the road.

821
01:06:41,662 --> 01:06:42,996
The police found the wreck

822
01:06:42,997 --> 01:06:45,331
and took everything
that was inside the car, so...

823
01:06:45,332 --> 01:06:47,400
Yeah, that's a surprise.

824
01:06:47,401 --> 01:06:50,336
I don't have anything
for you.

825
01:06:50,337 --> 01:06:53,172
I got a little bit of money
in the bank and my car.

826
01:06:53,173 --> 01:06:56,643
It's not much,
but it's all I have.

827
01:06:56,644 --> 01:06:58,078
If that's not enough,

828
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:00,947
then I guess you can just do
whatever you want to me.

829
01:07:00,948 --> 01:07:02,548
That's for my face.

830
01:07:02,549 --> 01:07:04,584
That's for my drugs.

831
01:07:06,954 --> 01:07:08,488
That was for fun.

832
01:07:09,657 --> 01:07:12,525
You need to rethink
this martyr thing.

833
01:07:12,526 --> 01:07:15,261
<i>It's all taken care of.</i>

834
01:07:18,565 --> 01:07:19,933
<i>Get out of here.</i>

835
01:07:21,401 --> 01:07:24,337
Before I fucking kill you,
get the fuck out of here.

836
01:07:24,338 --> 01:07:27,507
I got some celebrating
to do.

837
01:07:49,429 --> 01:07:50,463
Ready?

838
01:07:50,464 --> 01:07:51,731
Split!

839
01:07:51,732 --> 01:07:52,732
I think that's mine.

840
01:07:52,733 --> 01:07:54,668
No way.
Fine; take it.

841
01:08:06,747 --> 01:08:08,648
I'm going to read my book.

842
01:08:14,555 --> 01:08:17,190
What's wrong with him?

843
01:08:17,191 --> 01:08:22,261
He thought
you weren't coming back.

844
01:08:22,262 --> 01:08:24,130
What am I supposed
to tell him, Billy,

845
01:08:24,131 --> 01:08:27,667
when you disappear like that?

846
01:08:32,139 --> 01:08:34,340
Why did you sell this place?

847
01:08:45,986 --> 01:08:47,120
It was time.

848
01:09:04,105 --> 01:09:05,872
It was my hat that day.

849
01:09:05,873 --> 01:09:07,573
What?

850
01:09:07,574 --> 01:09:09,242
<i>It was--</i>

851
01:09:09,243 --> 01:09:11,911
It was my hat that day.

852
01:09:11,912 --> 01:09:13,579
Oh, stop it.

853
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:15,348
<i>No.</i>

854
01:09:15,349 --> 01:09:16,682
It was my hat,

855
01:09:16,683 --> 01:09:18,084
and all these years,
I've been blaming you.

856
01:09:18,085 --> 01:09:19,819
Billy--

857
01:09:19,820 --> 01:09:21,087
I've been so mad at you.

858
01:09:21,088 --> 01:09:22,088
Stop it!

859
01:09:22,089 --> 01:09:23,890
No, I can't stop, Mom,

860
01:09:23,891 --> 01:09:25,091
because I need to talk to you,

861
01:09:25,092 --> 01:09:27,127
and I need you to talk to me
about this.

862
01:09:27,128 --> 01:09:28,194
<i>I don't want</i>
<i>to talk about it!</i>

863
01:09:28,195 --> 01:09:29,195
<i>I've been so mad</i>
<i>at you.</i>

864
01:09:29,196 --> 01:09:30,196
Stop it.

865
01:09:30,197 --> 01:09:31,330
<i>No, I can't!</i>

866
01:09:31,331 --> 01:09:35,334
I don't want to talk
about this!

867
01:09:35,335 --> 01:09:36,836
But it was my fault!

868
01:09:36,837 --> 01:09:37,871
It was my fault!

869
01:09:37,872 --> 01:09:40,606
I did it!

870
01:09:55,956 --> 01:09:57,656
One of the drivers didn't show.

871
01:09:57,657 --> 01:09:58,891
Look, we're behind schedule,

872
01:09:58,892 --> 01:10:00,126
So I'm going
to the next field.

873
01:10:00,127 --> 01:10:01,794
I'll drive.

874
01:10:01,795 --> 01:10:03,062
Hey, boys,

875
01:10:03,063 --> 01:10:05,264
<i>Jennifer, get in the truck!</i>

876
01:10:27,621 --> 01:10:30,523
<i>Mom, my hat!</i>
<i>Stop!</i>

877
01:10:50,944 --> 01:10:52,412
<i>Hey!</i>

878
01:11:05,426 --> 01:11:09,995
Not a day goes by
I don't think about that day

879
01:11:09,996 --> 01:11:13,966
and how I could have
changed it.

880
01:11:13,967 --> 01:11:16,502
Oh, if I just--

881
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:49,569
Not a single day.

882
01:12:07,854 --> 01:12:12,992
It doesn't matter
whose hat it was.

883
01:12:14,995 --> 01:12:18,331
You were just
a little boy

884
01:12:18,332 --> 01:12:20,466
who had to grow up
in a day.

885
01:12:25,705 --> 01:12:29,808
And I wasn't much good
at helping you.

886
01:12:32,579 --> 01:12:34,713
I'm sorry...

887
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,584
For everything.

888
01:12:38,585 --> 01:12:42,455
But we have to stop now.

889
01:12:44,191 --> 01:12:46,959
I'm so tired.

890
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:50,129
Me too.

891
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:04,343
I can live with it now...

892
01:13:07,548 --> 01:13:11,551
Not having Andy.

893
01:13:11,552 --> 01:13:15,821
What I can't live with
is not having you.

894
01:13:18,392 --> 01:13:19,892
Mom.

895
01:13:51,191 --> 01:13:54,627
You think Andy's up there
somewhere?

896
01:13:58,298 --> 01:14:00,966
I don't know.

897
01:14:09,610 --> 01:14:12,245
What are you going
to tell him?

898
01:14:15,649 --> 01:14:19,017
Got to figure that out.

899
01:14:22,256 --> 01:14:25,090
I'm his dad.

900
01:15:32,859 --> 01:15:35,795
Wait a second.

901
01:15:37,297 --> 01:15:39,064
Jeez, man.

902
01:15:39,065 --> 01:15:41,300
I'm just getting up.

903
01:15:53,112 --> 01:15:54,513
Hey, Jesus Christ.

904
01:15:58,752 --> 01:15:59,752
Leo.

905
01:15:59,753 --> 01:16:01,754
I was coming to see you tonight.

906
01:16:01,755 --> 01:16:02,921
Hey, guys.

907
01:16:02,922 --> 01:16:04,757
You been hard
to get a hold of.

908
01:16:04,758 --> 01:16:06,124
Yeah, well,
things kind of got off track,

909
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:10,396
but, um, I got--
I got your money.

910
01:16:11,465 --> 01:16:12,398
That's right.

911
01:16:17,003 --> 01:16:18,303
This is it?

912
01:16:18,304 --> 01:16:19,672
Yeah, of course.

913
01:16:19,673 --> 01:16:21,240
It's, like, twice what the coke
would have been worth.

914
01:16:21,241 --> 01:16:22,975
Coke?

915
01:16:24,344 --> 01:16:27,446
Half of that shipment
was heroin.

916
01:16:27,447 --> 01:16:29,648
Didn't you even look, huh?

917
01:16:29,649 --> 01:16:31,116
You fucking idiot!

918
01:16:31,117 --> 01:16:32,284
Didn't you even look?

919
01:16:32,285 --> 01:16:34,253
Come here; give me
your fucking balls.

920
01:16:34,254 --> 01:16:35,354
Where's my shit?

921
01:16:35,355 --> 01:16:36,989
Where's
my fucking shit?

922
01:17:10,423 --> 01:17:11,758
What do you got there?

923
01:17:13,393 --> 01:17:16,229
I haven't seen these
in years.

924
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:18,931
Check this out.

925
01:17:18,932 --> 01:17:21,734
They bobble-wobble,
but they don't fall down.

926
01:17:23,937 --> 01:17:25,571
Great.

927
01:17:25,572 --> 01:17:27,506
Hey.

928
01:17:27,507 --> 01:17:31,878
I'm sorry for being
a jerk the other day.

929
01:17:35,883 --> 01:17:39,385
I'm sorry
that I've been gone a lot.

930
01:17:39,386 --> 01:17:42,054
There's been a lot
going on.

931
01:17:45,558 --> 01:17:47,994
What would you say
if I told you

932
01:17:47,995 --> 01:17:51,230
that I was your dad?

933
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,802
So?

934
01:17:57,304 --> 01:18:01,473
Right.

935
01:18:01,474 --> 01:18:04,410
Not sure I'd want me
for a dad either.

936
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:14,253
I need to talk to you
about your mom.

937
01:18:17,825 --> 01:18:19,025
Your mom loved you,
Clayton.

938
01:18:19,026 --> 01:18:21,493
She loved you more
than anyone else

939
01:18:21,494 --> 01:18:23,062
in the whole world.

940
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,068
What do you mean?

941
01:18:29,069 --> 01:18:31,804
She, um...

942
01:18:31,805 --> 01:18:34,106
She was in an accident.

943
01:18:34,107 --> 01:18:37,143
She died.

944
01:18:38,946 --> 01:18:39,912
No.

945
01:18:42,415 --> 01:18:43,782
You're a liar.

946
01:18:43,783 --> 01:18:46,452
No, it's true.

947
01:18:46,453 --> 01:18:47,619
No!

948
01:18:47,620 --> 01:18:49,121
You're a fucking liar!

949
01:18:49,122 --> 01:18:50,122
Clayton.

950
01:19:11,879 --> 01:19:13,279
Fill it up.

951
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,048
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

952
01:19:25,025 --> 01:19:27,526
Didn't I see you
come through here the other day,

953
01:19:27,527 --> 01:19:29,661
asking directions?

954
01:19:29,662 --> 01:19:32,999
No, that must have been
somebody else.

955
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:34,066
Ah.

956
01:19:59,559 --> 01:20:00,626
I'll talk to him.

957
01:20:00,627 --> 01:20:02,494
Nah, I should go.

958
01:20:02,495 --> 01:20:04,763
Let me try.

959
01:20:59,219 --> 01:21:00,786
She's coming back.

960
01:21:03,590 --> 01:21:05,657
She always does.

961
01:21:08,028 --> 01:21:09,862
I'm sorry, Clayton.

962
01:21:09,863 --> 01:21:12,498
I know
this is hard to hear.

963
01:21:12,499 --> 01:21:13,832
No!

964
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:16,402
She's coming back.

965
01:21:16,403 --> 01:21:19,171
She'll come back
for this.

966
01:21:19,172 --> 01:21:20,373
Oh, my God.
Clayton.

967
01:21:20,374 --> 01:21:21,807
No, listen to me.

968
01:21:21,808 --> 01:21:23,275
She'll come back for this.

969
01:21:27,747 --> 01:21:29,248
Wait here.

970
01:21:37,690 --> 01:21:39,258
For fuck's sake,
don't fuck around.

971
01:21:39,259 --> 01:21:41,894
If you've got any of it,
you got to give it to 'em.

972
01:21:41,895 --> 01:21:43,529
Red, I swear to you, man--

973
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:44,930
Don't fuck around!

974
01:21:44,931 --> 01:21:46,165
<i>This is deep shit!</i>

975
01:21:46,166 --> 01:21:47,833
You're in a whole lot
of fucking trouble here!

976
01:21:57,244 --> 01:21:58,277
What was that?

977
01:21:58,278 --> 01:21:59,811
Shh.

978
01:22:58,838 --> 01:23:00,939
Pete.

979
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,424
Run to the woods.

980
01:23:52,425 --> 01:23:53,425
Hide in the woods.

981
01:23:53,426 --> 01:23:55,928
No.
- Go, go.

982
01:23:55,929 --> 01:23:57,029
Go!

983
01:23:57,030 --> 01:23:58,664
<i>Go!</i>

984
01:24:13,046 --> 01:24:14,446
Whoo!

985
01:24:14,447 --> 01:24:17,616
Over here!

986
01:24:17,617 --> 01:24:18,784
<i>Whoo!</i>

987
01:24:18,785 --> 01:24:19,985
Get in.

988
01:24:51,785 --> 01:24:54,486
Over here!
Over he--

989
01:25:07,701 --> 01:25:09,034
<i>Mom!</i>

990
01:25:22,248 --> 01:25:24,883
Mom!

991
01:25:53,847 --> 01:25:56,148
Where's Clayton?

992
01:25:56,149 --> 01:25:58,516
<i>He's in the woods.</i>

993
01:26:21,141 --> 01:26:23,876
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

994
01:26:23,877 --> 01:26:25,744
Okay.

995
01:26:53,439 --> 01:26:55,707
<i>Okay, let's do it.</i>

996
01:26:58,678 --> 01:27:01,046
What are they doing?

997
01:27:01,047 --> 01:27:04,049
He's terrorizing
a lizard.

998
01:27:04,050 --> 01:27:07,986
<i>Don't forget to call me</i>
<i>before you start back.</i>

999
01:27:07,987 --> 01:27:09,988
Yes, Mom.

1000
01:27:12,658 --> 01:27:15,360
Don't let the kid give you
too much trouble.

1001
01:27:15,361 --> 01:27:17,395
He won't.

1002
01:27:19,665 --> 01:27:20,699
Here it is.

1003
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:22,467
Get it. Get it.
Get it. Get it!

1004
01:27:29,108 --> 01:27:32,811
I used to get so melancholy
this time of year.

1005
01:27:35,414 --> 01:27:40,986
It's kind of sad,
the change of seasons.

1006
01:27:49,062 --> 01:27:52,097
Remember those big parties
we used to have out here?

1007
01:27:52,098 --> 01:27:54,266
Yeah.

1008
01:27:54,267 --> 01:27:58,203
It's just a dry patch
of dirt now.

1009
01:28:06,346 --> 01:28:09,047
It was just a dry patch
of dirt then.

1010
