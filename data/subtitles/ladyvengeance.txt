Sympathy for Lady Vengeance

6
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:11,492
They say she's a real live angel

7
00:02:13,253 --> 00:02:18,694
Everyone in there calls her
"Kind-hearted" Geum-ja

8
00:02:32,137 --> 00:02:33,978
One, two, three, four!

9
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:40,740
My path is ridden with...

10
00:03:00,185 --> 00:03:03,425
...high walls and deep pitfalls

11
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:10,387
Who will aid me across these
dark obstacles?

12
00:03:11,908 --> 00:03:18,309
The Lord's breath lifts me over
these walls

13
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:24,551
The Lord's hands bridge my steps
safely over these pitfalls

14
00:03:26,391 --> 00:03:33,233
.. safely over these pitfalls

15
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:49,637
What about the winter clothes I sent you?

16
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:58,319
It's been hard, hasn't it?
13 and a half years

17
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:01,320
I'm so proud of you

18
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:07,602
Won-mo and I were playing marbles
here that day, and I lost

19
00:04:07,842 --> 00:04:11,203
Won-mo won the biggest marble

20
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:15,324
Then he ran off to go home

21
00:04:15,564 --> 00:04:17,244
The investigating authorities...

22
00:04:17,484 --> 00:04:19,765
...confirmed the details with a woman
who confessed to the crime

23
00:04:20,085 --> 00:04:23,886
Lee Geum-ja was first introduced to
the public...

24
00:04:24,086 --> 00:04:27,407
...as the criminal who abducted and
killed Park Won-mo, a little boy...

25
00:04:27,847 --> 00:04:29,927
She was nineteen at the time

26
00:04:31,008 --> 00:04:33,448
The whole nation was shocked

27
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,569
by her youth, her ruthless methods...

28
00:04:35,769 --> 00:04:38,770
...and by her unabashed naivety

29
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:40,210
My state of mind...

30
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:43,091
This is where the alleged perpetrator
had confined young Park Won-mo

31
00:04:43,371 --> 00:04:46,052
She claims she only wanted to stop
his crying with a pillow...

32
00:04:46,332 --> 00:04:49,532
But what shocked us more were her
beautiful looks

33
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:54,454
Clamouring tabloids compared her to
Olivia Hussey...

34
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:59,215
A tactless director announced plans for
a Lee Geum-ja movie...

35
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:01,776
...creating a backlash from the press

36
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:06,737
That fall, polka-dot dresses became
the trend

37
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,698
I saw you on TV

38
00:05:11,138 --> 00:05:16,339
Behind that wicked witch's face of yours
I saw the presence of an angel

39
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,021
An angel...Could that be true?

40
00:05:23,701 --> 00:05:27,222
Do you really think an angel resides
in me?

41
00:05:27,742 --> 00:05:29,383
If so, where was that angel...

42
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:33,744
...when I was committing such an
evil act?

43
00:05:34,744 --> 00:05:36,784
I always wondered about this

44
00:05:36,864 --> 00:05:39,345
after hearing what the preacher said

45
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,226
And then, I realized...

46
00:05:42,386 --> 00:05:47,267
...that the angel inside me only reveals
itself when I invoke it

47
00:05:49,668 --> 00:05:51,908
Where are you? Please, come out

48
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:55,389
I'm right here

49
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:00,871
This act of invoking an angel...

50
00:06:01,151 --> 00:06:05,032
This is what we call prayer

51
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:11,193
Actually, prison is an ideal place to
learn to pray

52
00:06:14,634 --> 00:06:15,994
Because...

53
00:06:16,235 --> 00:06:22,076
...we know that we are all sinners
in here

54
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:28,678
Thank you

Testimonials of Faith Day for Inmates

56
00:06:53,724 --> 00:06:56,845
It's tradition to eat tofu on release...

57
00:06:57,085 --> 00:07:00,006
...so that you'll live white and never
sin again

58
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:18,170
Why don't you go screw yourself?

61
00:08:11,344 --> 00:08:12,664
Meet your new cellmate

62
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:19,626
I'm Kim Yang-hee. I got 5 years

63
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:24,067
They said there was someone at
Kyoungju Women's Prison...

64
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,148
...whose face would shine

65
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:29,228
You were a whore, weren't you?

66
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,590
I heard her nickname was "the Witch"

67
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,230
Come on in

68
00:09:05,078 --> 00:09:07,038
You don't usually wear ties

69
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:10,519
It's mandatory here

70
00:09:10,999 --> 00:09:13,920
We have lots of VIPs visiting

71
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,401
Shit, it's too tight. Loosen it up a bit

72
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:22,802
He was my pimp

73
00:09:23,682 --> 00:09:26,843
It felt so good when I was strangling him

74
00:09:31,044 --> 00:09:35,485
-I should've killed myself instead
-Then, die

75
00:09:35,885 --> 00:09:40,407
And be born again. Over and over
if you need to

76
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:48,849
Prayer is like a scrubbing towel
Scrub off all your sins

77
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:57,051
Then your skin will become as new as
a baby's ass. Right?

78
00:09:57,211 --> 00:10:02,292
Geum-ja taught me how to lament
my past lives

79
00:10:13,495 --> 00:10:15,856
It's a little noisy,
being under the stairs...

80
00:10:17,696 --> 00:10:20,217
But this place brings good luck

81
00:10:21,137 --> 00:10:25,938
Look at me. Three years of giving
unlicensed haircuts...

82
00:10:26,218 --> 00:10:28,899
And now I have a real shop of my own

83
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,380
So set your hopes high

84
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:50,664
These were mine, but they'll have to do
for now

85
00:10:55,826 --> 00:11:01,227
You know I wanted to get you better
things, right?

86
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:08,669
Don't you have any high heels?

87
00:11:16,871 --> 00:11:19,752
You never really loved me, did you?

88
00:11:20,552 --> 00:11:22,433
You were just pretending, right?

89
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:28,714
You've changed a lot

90
00:11:29,594 --> 00:11:31,315
You used to be so sweet...

91
00:11:31,715 --> 00:11:33,795
...and talk so kindly

92
00:11:36,036 --> 00:11:37,916
Are you starting the plan already?

93
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:44,078
'No. The plan was already started
13 years ago'...

94
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:49,359
...so Geum-ja murmured to herself

95
00:13:29,305 --> 00:13:30,905
Farewell

96
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:19,398
What is it you want from us?

97
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,801
Please forgive me. Please...

98
00:14:32,641 --> 00:14:38,883
She was going to beg Won-mo's
parents until she had no fingers left

99
00:14:39,283 --> 00:14:40,963
This is 802/9 Han Apartments...

100
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:44,084
We've had a finger cut off here!

101
00:14:55,087 --> 00:14:59,248
Every penny Geum-ja earned from
labouring in prison...

102
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:01,968
...had to go to pay for her
finger operation

103
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,529
Then 6 days later...

104
00:15:05,329 --> 00:15:06,370
Naruse Bakery

105
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,690
For now, just work till noon

106
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:11,451
The dawn hours are tough for me with
my low blood pressure

107
00:15:15,532 --> 00:15:18,173
Geun-shik, say hello

108
00:15:18,413 --> 00:15:22,334
I told you about Lee Geum-ja, right?

109
00:15:23,334 --> 00:15:24,414
Hello

110
00:15:30,456 --> 00:15:32,456
I told you she was pretty

111
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:39,218
Can I call you elder sister?

112
00:15:43,059 --> 00:15:44,979
Just call me Geum-ja

113
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,260
Lee Geum-ja...

114
00:15:49,701 --> 00:15:53,902
When she first came, she cried
non-stop, like a newborn baby

115
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:57,022
Man, it was so depressing

116
00:15:58,983 --> 00:16:00,303
Damn bitch!

117
00:16:05,505 --> 00:16:08,465
It brings bad luck. Stop crying!

118
00:16:16,107 --> 00:16:22,829
As a man once taught her, whenever
she was having a hard time...

119
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:26,670
She'd bend over and take five
deep breaths

120
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,471
Woo So-young Time served 1990~1996

121
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:34,872
What are you looking at?
You damn bitches!

122
00:16:38,193 --> 00:16:40,634
Down on the floor and keep your damn
hands up!

123
00:16:56,118 --> 00:17:02,039
I felt like I was dying because I couldn't
be with my love...

124
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:06,640
Turned out I was suffering from chronic
kidney failure

125
00:17:07,961 --> 00:17:10,961
But it felt like I was dying anyway

126
00:17:12,482 --> 00:17:17,123
Then this bitch suddenly says she'll
give me one of her kidneys

127
00:17:19,523 --> 00:17:26,165
It's not as if a kidney's a bit of fluff you
give away so easily

128
00:17:26,485 --> 00:17:27,846
Damn bitch

129
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:33,807
It brings me bad luck. Stop crying!

130
00:17:41,929 --> 00:17:45,410
Honey, Geum-ja's here

131
00:17:48,171 --> 00:17:50,851
You've sure changed a lot

132
00:17:51,412 --> 00:17:54,292
You heard my wife - stay down!

133
00:17:57,813 --> 00:18:04,215
That's when I realized I'm married
to a goddess

134
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:11,297
With this man by my side I
was never afraid. Right, honey?

135
00:18:13,497 --> 00:18:17,938
Yeah, but we couldn't go in together

136
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:21,539
They should have couples prisons

137
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:29,901
But then that would be paradise, not jail

138
00:18:33,022 --> 00:18:35,623
I don't know how to thank you

139
00:18:35,863 --> 00:18:41,824
Honey, Geum-ja is
readying a magnificent plan

140
00:18:44,505 --> 00:18:47,426
You can help her, right?

141
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:53,147
The Way of Dhamma

142
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:20,954
Where did you get this? It's real old

143
00:19:22,515 --> 00:19:26,116
Comrade Geum-ja, it's no use

144
00:19:27,156 --> 00:19:31,517
-Go save yourself
-Okay, right after I finish this

145
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:33,998
Finish the chicken later

146
00:19:35,678 --> 00:19:39,439
And be careful. Don't let dogs have the
chicken bones

147
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,801
Pass me that yellowing book

148

Ko Sun-sook Time served 1967~1997

149
00:19:49,642 --> 00:19:53,323
A spy from North Korea, Ko Sun-sook
had Alzheimer's...

150
00:19:53,603 --> 00:19:55,203
...and was a problem for the prison

151
00:19:55,563 --> 00:19:58,644
So when Geum-ja volunteered to look
after her...

152
00:19:58,844 --> 00:20:01,845
Even the prison warden was relieved

153
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:05,846
They were stepping around me
whispering, "The woman spy is dead"

154
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,166
But the pride in my heart...

155
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:13,768
...wouldn't let me die

156
00:20:14,808 --> 00:20:18,689
You said living is a struggle, too
A struggle not to die

157
00:20:25,531 --> 00:20:29,852
I give you this flower...

158
00:20:32,893 --> 00:20:37,614
...for you have vengeance to take
comrade

159
00:21:04,101 --> 00:21:05,141
My goodness!

160
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,382
You shouldn't be out so late!

161
00:21:13,183 --> 00:21:15,224
I asked for you at Naruse

162
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:29,867
What were you thinking?

163
00:21:30,147 --> 00:21:36,669
I don't want every Tom Dick and Harry
dropping by

164
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,910
Fine. I'll see you tomorrow

165
00:21:48,632 --> 00:21:51,833
How could you have changed so much?

166
00:21:52,473 --> 00:21:54,794
This isn't like you!

167
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:59,355
Could we start over again?

168
00:22:01,395 --> 00:22:04,876
Come to church. Please?

169
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:14,759
I've converted to Buddhism!

170
00:22:16,639 --> 00:22:18,360
I bet you're in for adultery

171
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,400
-How did you know?
-It's all over your face, bitch!

172
00:22:31,123 --> 00:22:32,643
Please crawl over here

173
00:22:50,488 --> 00:22:51,768
Please take them off

174
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:58,250
Oh Soo-hee Time served 1993~1994

Can you see it well?

176
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:34,259
Say hello to each other

177
00:23:35,859 --> 00:23:37,180
Hello

178
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,901
Hello?

179
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:47,462
This damn bitch is that infamous "Witch"

180
00:23:49,223 --> 00:23:52,784
She killed her husband and his mistress
then ate them

181
00:23:53,024 --> 00:23:59,185
So...I guess I'm not the unluckiest

182
00:23:59,906 --> 00:24:02,946
I'll suck on her for five minutes and
cry it off

183
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:20,191
I hate them skinny bitches

184
00:24:21,391 --> 00:24:25,672
So go tell Geum-ja to start eating
some more, okay?

185
00:25:30,329 --> 00:25:33,809
Your style has changed

186
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,531
What's with the blood-red eye shadow?

187
00:25:42,732 --> 00:25:47,373
People are always saying I look
kind-hearted

188
00:25:56,415 --> 00:26:00,016
People order them from me, Modelled
on their guys' photos

189
00:26:01,136 --> 00:26:04,697
They're very popular. Want me to make
you one?

190
00:26:08,338 --> 00:26:10,299
Can you make it in silver?

191
00:26:22,222 --> 00:26:24,102
Did you find that bastard yet?

192
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:25,463
I did

193
00:26:26,983 --> 00:26:28,303
Did you kill him?

194
00:26:28,743 --> 00:26:29,744
Not yet

195
00:26:31,024 --> 00:26:32,304
Why not?

196
00:26:33,065 --> 00:26:34,465
I've been busy

197
00:26:38,026 --> 00:26:42,307
"Saving the best for last," is that it?

198
00:26:48,829 --> 00:26:49,709
Yes

199
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:54,910
I'll take this one -Excellent choice

200
00:26:57,111 --> 00:27:01,792
Is it true the owner studied confection
in Japan?

201
00:27:03,312 --> 00:27:05,593
The lady made this one

202
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:14,475
You've changed so much, I hardly
recognized you

203
00:27:20,757 --> 00:27:22,917
Who was she? -Who was he?

204
00:27:23,877 --> 00:27:25,078
She's pretty

205
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:28,199
The detective that was in charge of
my case

206
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:32,480
When I was exactly your age...

207
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:38,961
That is, when I was nineteen, and you
were five...

208
00:27:40,402 --> 00:27:41,402
I...

209
00:27:41,842 --> 00:27:45,443
Kidnapped and killed a five year-old boy

210
00:27:45,923 --> 00:27:47,163
My goodness!

211
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:51,324
Don't worry. I didn't eat him...

212
00:27:51,525 --> 00:27:53,445
We can't eat this!

213
00:27:53,725 --> 00:27:56,126
It was made by hands that have killed!

214
00:27:56,966 --> 00:28:01,287
I'm telling you I killed him

215
00:28:01,607 --> 00:28:04,328
How many times do I have to tell you?

216
00:28:05,008 --> 00:28:09,609
Then tell me what that marble
looked like

217
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:11,770
What?

218
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:19,452
That marble you said you saw but didn't
know where it went...

219
00:28:20,252 --> 00:28:24,093
It was Won-mo's favourite marble

220
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,294
What colour was it?

221
00:28:40,817 --> 00:28:42,017
Light green

222
00:28:46,699 --> 00:28:51,860
Come on! Why would anyone confess
to a murder they didn't commit?

223
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,501
Why won't you believe me?

224
00:28:54,821 --> 00:28:57,701
Is it because I'm a murderer?

225
00:29:24,708 --> 00:29:27,389
Believe in Jesus, go to heaven

226
00:29:27,629 --> 00:29:32,750
Believe in Jesus, go to heaven
Without faith, there's only hell

227
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:35,271
Devil, begone!

228
00:29:35,831 --> 00:29:39,712
Begone, you devil!

229
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:36,462
On top of that, I killed again in prison

230
00:31:45,744 --> 00:31:52,666
Geum-ja wondered if Geun-shik
wasn't a fool

231
00:32:03,709 --> 00:32:05,509
I understand what you're saying...

232
00:32:05,709 --> 00:32:09,070
But it's against regulations to give out
that information

233
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:13,311
There is a counseling service I can refer
you to...

234
00:32:13,551 --> 00:32:15,992
Could you at least tell me whether she
was adopted or not?

235
00:32:17,112 --> 00:32:18,953
Didn't you receive the notice?

236
00:32:21,393 --> 00:32:23,234
I was in jail, you see

237
00:32:25,634 --> 00:32:30,516
I'd like to show you the 18-year-old
Lee Geum-ja...

238
00:32:31,756 --> 00:32:34,397
A pretty girl who would turn any head...

239
00:32:34,557 --> 00:32:37,597
But who wasn't the least bit particular

240
00:32:37,877 --> 00:32:39,638
But this poor girl was on the verge of
going mad

241
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:45,119
She tried to comfort herself...

242
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:54,802
...with the thought that it happens to
every woman sooner or later

243
00:32:58,763 --> 00:33:00,003
Teacher? Mr. Baek?

244
00:33:00,203 --> 00:33:02,204
This is Geum-ja, Lee Geum-ja

245
00:33:03,404 --> 00:33:08,045
I used to polish your shoes when you
were our student teacher last year

246
00:33:08,445 --> 00:33:10,086
You didn't know it was me?

247
00:33:10,926 --> 00:33:15,087
You told me I was sexy

248
00:33:17,288 --> 00:33:19,888
Yes. You remember me, right?

249
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:23,609
Pardon?

250
00:33:23,929 --> 00:33:25,330
Well, it's nothing much...

251
00:33:25,530 --> 00:33:28,170
You see, teacher, I'm pregnant

252
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,091
Pregnant

253
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,451
No, pregnant!

254
00:33:33,692 --> 00:33:35,972
Yes, I am

255
00:33:36,252 --> 00:33:38,253
Could I go live with you? Please?

256
00:33:40,693 --> 00:33:46,335
I can't go to my mom's. And and it's
even worse at my dad's

257
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:56,377
Him? He's just a big kid, not ready
for fatherhood

258
00:33:58,978 --> 00:34:02,419
Don't worry, baby. Your mama's
right here

259
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,901
The poor girl murmured to herself

260
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:57,833
There's a drug called "Timing"
It suppresses sleep

261
00:34:59,674 --> 00:35:04,435
When I was just back from Tokyo
managing a confectionery factory...

262
00:35:05,475 --> 00:35:10,556
There's a drug called "Timing"
It suppresses sleep

263
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,117
They all hated me

264
00:35:13,397 --> 00:35:16,438
You have to be careful when riding
a bike after taking it though

265
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,399
Hello

266
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,161
What are you doing out in the cold?

267
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:32,962
Have you eaten? -Yes, ma'am

268
00:35:39,644 --> 00:35:43,645
Geum-ja, what brings you here
at this hour?

269
00:35:43,885 --> 00:35:45,605
I need an advance

270
00:35:49,726 --> 00:35:51,207
No advances

271
00:35:53,887 --> 00:35:56,728
I went to Kyoungju, where my parents
lived...

272
00:35:57,368 --> 00:36:00,729
I volunteered to teach at the women's
prison there...

273
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:06,691
Because my folks worried I couldn't get
married with my lame leg

274
00:36:12,572 --> 00:36:18,454
But in my third year there
I was shocked almost to death...

275
00:36:19,214 --> 00:36:22,095
...after tasting a strawberry mousse
made by a kidnapper

276
00:36:22,255 --> 00:36:26,096
The ingredients given to the inmates
were miserable...

277
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:32,057
But she'd used them to create a cake
fit for a king

278
00:36:32,257 --> 00:36:33,738
Three months' advance

279
00:36:40,339 --> 00:36:42,420
You know, you've changed?

280
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:48,061
In the end, I packed up and moved
to Seoul

281
00:36:48,341 --> 00:36:51,302
Because I was motivated to open up
my own bakery

282
00:36:52,302 --> 00:36:53,583
What are you doing?

283
00:36:54,743 --> 00:36:57,023
Writing my account number

284
00:37:08,947 --> 00:37:14,388
I want to start a family young...

285
00:37:16,588 --> 00:37:20,870
And hope to marry someone
I can respect

286
00:37:33,873 --> 00:37:39,594
So, you did something wrong...

287
00:37:39,994 --> 00:37:46,996
You make penance and promise never
to do it again, right?

288
00:37:47,996 --> 00:37:50,997
That's just how life goes. That's life!

289
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:53,918
It's just another experience gained

290
00:37:54,158 --> 00:37:55,638
Isn't that right, Geum-ja?

291
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:59,679
I'm planning to kill another person

292
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,720
What?

293
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,801
Do you think I'm sexy?

294
00:38:07,441 --> 00:38:09,242
Yes...No

295
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:11,843
Well...

296
00:38:25,406 --> 00:38:27,847
I was hoping we could talk some more

297
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:39,330
Maybe later?

298
00:38:43,891 --> 00:38:46,371
You're trying to scare me, aren't you?

299
00:38:48,772 --> 00:38:50,933
You're trying to put me off?

300
00:38:55,054 --> 00:38:57,894
Does it put you off when a girl does this?

301
00:38:58,935 --> 00:39:00,215
No

302
00:39:04,856 --> 00:39:05,896
Please go ahead

303
00:39:43,786 --> 00:39:50,428
It was alright for me
Was it good for you?

304
00:39:53,348 --> 00:39:55,389
I've been told it was so-so

305
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,110
No way

306
00:40:03,391 --> 00:40:07,312
Mr. Baek said there are good
kidnappings and bad kidnappings

307
00:40:08,112 --> 00:40:09,072
What?

308
00:40:09,232 --> 00:40:12,313
He said it was a good kidnapping
if the child is returned safely

309
00:40:12,553 --> 00:40:14,594
And since they're rich, a little ransom
wouldn't make much difference...

310
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:16,514
And although they'd have to worry
a few days...

311
00:40:16,794 --> 00:40:19,115
The emotional reunion would make...

312
00:40:19,315 --> 00:40:23,196
the family bond more closely

313
00:40:23,556 --> 00:40:27,997
That's what he said, but then he went
and killed Won-mo

314
00:40:28,437 --> 00:40:31,318
The boy kept crying...

315
00:40:31,558 --> 00:40:34,639
And Mr. Baek said he'd kill him if he
didn't stop in 5 minutes

316
00:40:34,839 --> 00:40:36,719
But then he really did kill him

317
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:41,321
If he were alive, he'd be your age now
but he's dead

318
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:45,042
Then the police found a witness

319
00:40:45,362 --> 00:40:48,642
Someone saw me taking Won-mo to
a bath-house

320
00:40:49,003 --> 00:40:51,443
Then one day, when I came back from
the market,

321
00:40:51,963 --> 00:40:54,204
my daughter was gone

322
00:41:01,166 --> 00:41:03,846
I got a call from Mr. Baek

323
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:08,648
He said to confess and take all the
blame or my girl would die, too

324
00:41:10,168 --> 00:41:14,729
So the kidnapper had kidnapped
a kidnapper's kid

325
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:17,890
Isn't that funny?

326
00:41:20,051 --> 00:41:22,371
I thought it was

327
00:41:26,732 --> 00:41:29,013
The house key is the middle one

328
00:41:30,653 --> 00:41:33,134
Make sure these candles don't go out

329
00:41:38,495 --> 00:41:41,336
Touch anything else and I'll give you
a hole in the head

330
00:41:45,577 --> 00:41:46,977
Going somewhere?

331
00:45:46,238 --> 00:45:51,040
It'll sound like a cannon, with lots of
smoke, too

332
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,920
The design's so primitive

333
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,681
What's the use of all this fanciness?
Better to have a strong solid shot

334
00:45:57,921 --> 00:46:01,562
It has to be pretty. Everything should
be pretty

335
00:46:01,882 --> 00:46:07,404
It has a very short range
So get up close when you shoot

336
00:46:07,964 --> 00:46:10,845
If you can hear his heart beating...

337
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:15,806
And see the sweat on his forehead
even better

338
00:46:16,846 --> 00:46:22,368
It's like playing golf. You get good hits
with good form

339
00:46:23,008 --> 00:46:24,848
Got a place to practice?

340
00:46:52,255 --> 00:46:57,336
Tomorrow, let's go on a picnic, okay?

341
00:47:18,982 --> 00:47:21,343
That's right. A picnic...

342
00:48:06,314 --> 00:48:11,315
For the longest time, Geum-ja has
wanted to meet with Won-mo...

343
00:48:11,595 --> 00:48:14,396
And ask for his forgiveness

344
00:48:14,716 --> 00:48:21,278
She'd be very unhappy if she
found out he appeared before Jenny

345
00:48:50,885 --> 00:48:55,166
Weekends with the family, and the dog...
Right?

346
00:50:42,794 --> 00:50:44,274
Oppa

347
00:50:45,595 --> 00:50:46,675
Oppa

348
00:51:00,118 --> 00:51:01,599
Appa

349
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:03,679
Appa

350
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:06,880
Jenny -Stupid

351
00:51:21,084 --> 00:51:23,324
Here I am...Here I am...

352
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:24,685
How are you this morning?

353
00:51:24,965 --> 00:51:28,446
Very well thank you. Run away

354
00:51:28,686 --> 00:51:33,127
way, run away...Where is mother?...

355
00:52:52,107 --> 00:52:53,227
Honey...

356
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:54,747
Honey...

357
00:52:57,068 --> 00:53:01,349
I'm meeting with friends later today

358
00:53:02,990 --> 00:53:07,031
I'll have your dinner ready before I leave

359
00:53:08,591 --> 00:53:10,191
Would you mind?

360
00:53:11,032 --> 00:53:15,353
Don't you be the one to pay for dinner

361
00:53:15,513 --> 00:53:16,993
Right...

362
00:53:17,193 --> 00:53:20,874
Park Yi-jeong Time served 1993~1999

363
00:54:28,091 --> 00:54:30,252
Hey, harlot

364
00:54:31,012 --> 00:54:33,693
You parasite, living off of men's blood

365
00:54:36,693 --> 00:54:39,854
I've got just the job for a slut like you

366
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,541
You know how itchy it is when you get
bit on the sole of your foot?

367
00:55:06,941 --> 00:55:09,622
What did I tell you? What did I say!

368
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:12,303
It tickles when you scratch...

369
00:55:12,543 --> 00:55:14,183
and it itches when you don't scratch

370
00:55:14,463 --> 00:55:18,664
Itches if you don't scratch, and tickles
when you do. Right?

371
00:55:18,904 --> 00:55:25,866
You slut! Itches if you don't scratch
and tickles when you do...

372
00:55:50,832 --> 00:55:53,433
I used to have a strong stomach

373
00:55:55,594 --> 00:55:57,434
I don't know what the problem is...

374
00:55:57,674 --> 00:55:58,794
Here...

375
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:14,078
Sorry. Nasty, huh?

376
00:56:14,238 --> 00:56:17,319
That's quite alright. I enjoy helping you

377
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:25,481
Thanks, Geum-ja. You really are
kind-hearted

378
00:56:28,402 --> 00:56:34,403
You understand that I only like
plump girls, right?

379
00:56:36,444 --> 00:56:42,165
Of course. I'll eat a lot, too
and plump up for you

380
00:56:42,606 --> 00:56:48,927
So, you just keep taking lots of food
and medicine...

381
00:56:55,409 --> 00:56:56,649
And hurry up and die

382
00:56:57,249 --> 00:57:00,650
She fed her bleach? -Really?

383
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:03,571
For how long? -Three years

384
00:57:05,411 --> 00:57:08,052
What a clean stomach she must've had

385
00:57:09,732 --> 00:57:14,014
-Geum-ja the Kind-hearted
-Well done, her!

386
00:57:14,614 --> 00:57:18,575
After that, Geum-ja inherited the
"Witch" nickname...

387
00:57:18,815 --> 00:57:21,776
But was also still referred to as
"Kind-hearted Geum-ja"

388
00:57:22,536 --> 00:57:25,536
Everyone wanted to help Kind-hearted
Geum-ja...

389
00:57:25,937 --> 00:57:30,218
And no one could refuse the Witch
any favours

390
00:57:30,258 --> 00:57:32,098
It has to be tonight

391
00:57:32,258 --> 00:57:34,819
I can't take it any more. Not even for you

392
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:40,540
Soo-kyoung, a thief released before me
found out where Baek was working

393
00:57:41,020 --> 00:57:44,501
Seong-eun, a smart college grad...

394
00:57:44,701 --> 00:57:46,662
...was later released and got a job
at the same place

395
00:57:47,022 --> 00:57:51,143
She then informed me of Baek's
intention of getting a new car

396
00:57:51,383 --> 00:57:53,464
Later, Baek was visited by

397
00:57:53,744 --> 00:57:56,104
a pretty car dealer, Park Yi-jeong

398
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:48,118
It'll be used wisely for the Lord's work

399
00:58:59,000 --> 00:58:59,961
Hello?

400
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:02,401
Darling

401
00:59:04,362 --> 00:59:06,122
Have you had dinner?

402
00:59:07,242 --> 00:59:09,243
I'll wait and have it with you

403
00:59:10,483 --> 00:59:13,124
You can go ahead without me

404
00:59:15,164 --> 00:59:20,086
I'll wait for you, so hurry back

405
00:59:22,966 --> 00:59:26,607
He hasn't eaten yet. I'll go and make
him eat first

406
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:28,768
It's okay. Don't worry

407
00:59:29,328 --> 00:59:30,328
Bye

408
01:01:23,077 --> 01:01:24,637
Geum-ja

409
01:01:24,917 --> 01:01:28,718
At that moment, Geum-ja held her
breath and struggled to break free

410
01:02:54,380 --> 01:03:01,302
Even in this desperate situation
she never forgot the gun's firing range

411
01:05:44,864 --> 01:05:46,504
Got an English-Korean dictionary?

412
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:53,906
Don't think that I forgive you

413
01:05:54,386 --> 01:05:59,267
I think mothers who dump their kids
should go to jail

414
01:06:01,028 --> 01:06:05,709
When I was younger, I often thought of
taking revenge out on you

415
01:06:06,669 --> 01:06:11,030
But I couldn't imagine the thought of
killing you

416
01:06:11,911 --> 01:06:15,872
Reason being that, I didn't know what
your face looked like

417
01:06:16,352 --> 01:06:22,433
Anyway, since we're on better terms
now, give me your reasons at least

418
01:06:23,674 --> 01:06:30,235
Saying sorry is not enough
You should say sorry at least 3 times

419
01:06:31,436 --> 01:06:34,396
Ungenerously your daughter, Jenny

420
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:49,720
Left turn

421
01:07:27,570 --> 01:07:33,011
I remember when I first had you, Jenny

422
01:07:34,492 --> 01:07:40,933
As you grew in me, I felt like my wallet
was getting fatter

423
01:07:48,495 --> 01:07:55,497
But even before you could celebrate your
first birthday, I had to go to prison...

424
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,740
I had to give you up

425
01:08:07,020 --> 01:08:13,181
You are a sweet child you'd smile your
pretty smiles to complete strangers...

426
01:08:16,382 --> 01:08:23,144
I knew anyone will be happy to have
you anyone will be able to love you

427
01:08:30,666 --> 01:08:37,028
After I'm done with this man...

428
01:08:43,309 --> 01:08:46,110
I'm planning to return you to Australia

429
01:08:49,511 --> 01:08:55,832
My sins are too great and too deep...

430
01:09:00,514 --> 01:09:05,355
for me to take care such a sweet child
like you

431
01:09:08,596 --> 01:09:13,077
You're innocent, but

432
01:09:13,957 --> 01:09:19,878
but I made you grew up without a mother...

433
01:09:29,521 --> 01:09:36,043
But, also part of the punishment I must take

434
01:09:43,404 --> 01:09:47,245
Listen carefully

435
01:09:47,926 --> 01:09:53,687
People make mistakes

436
01:09:53,927 --> 01:10:00,449
If you commit a sin, you have to make
atonement for that sin

437
01:10:01,969 --> 01:10:06,450
Atonement, do you know what
that means?

438
01:10:06,650 --> 01:10:10,371
Atonement

439
01:10:10,571 --> 01:10:13,972
Yes, that's it

440
01:10:14,412 --> 01:10:18,653
Big atonement for big sins...

441
01:10:18,853 --> 01:10:23,455
Small atonement for small sins

442
01:10:23,735 --> 01:10:24,775
OK?

443
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:48,181
Because he made me a sinner

444
01:10:56,303 --> 01:11:02,985
This man killed a little boy...

445
01:11:09,506 --> 01:11:10,707
And...

446
01:11:10,787 --> 01:11:11,747
I helped him

447
01:11:50,397 --> 01:11:52,837
I was happy...

448
01:11:54,358 --> 01:12:00,799
Too happy for a sinner

449
01:12:05,601 --> 01:12:06,841
Jenny

450
01:12:22,285 --> 01:12:26,366
I'm truly sorry

451
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:44,891
Farewell

452
01:13:25,861 --> 01:13:32,503
Get up, teacher! Time to go to work!

453
01:14:52,803 --> 01:14:58,885
Geum-ja, what's with that eye shadow?

454
01:16:36,270 --> 01:16:38,150
Do you know why those kids...

455
01:17:12,719 --> 01:17:14,599
Hey! Here's another one!

456
01:17:20,001 --> 01:17:21,121
Hello?

457
01:17:29,483 --> 01:17:31,084
If you'd found the real killer back then...

458
01:17:31,324 --> 01:17:35,525
These children wouldn't have died, right?

459
01:17:37,805 --> 01:17:40,046
You know how this feels

460
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:46,327
There were four!

461
01:17:59,931 --> 01:18:03,532
-I told you I can't come to work today
-It's not that...

462
01:18:05,292 --> 01:18:07,973
-Someone's here looking for you
-Who?

463
01:18:09,053 --> 01:18:12,414
-Well, the thing is
-They won't say who they are?

464
01:18:12,614 --> 01:18:14,375
I don't know what they're saying

465
01:18:23,097 --> 01:18:25,858
Can you speak Japanese?

466
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,740
Mommy!

467
01:18:36,740 --> 01:18:39,061
Please hurry and come get me...

468
01:18:39,261 --> 01:18:42,222
Mommy...

469
01:18:42,422 --> 01:18:47,263
There, there. Don't cry. Don't cry...

470
01:20:25,608 --> 01:20:27,769
Mommy... please hurry

471
01:20:27,929 --> 01:20:32,810
Mommy, I want to go home
Please hurry, mommy

472
01:20:33,050 --> 01:20:35,131
There, there... Don't cry. Don't cry

473
01:20:35,371 --> 01:20:41,332
Mommy, where are you?

474
01:20:48,734 --> 01:20:54,615
I know it's difficult but take a good look
at this man

475
01:20:56,336 --> 01:21:00,577
Next is Se-hyun, killed in 1995

476
01:21:06,418 --> 01:21:13,300
Dad...I can't...

477
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:15,621
Daddy

478
01:21:21,062 --> 01:21:23,383
This is Eun-joo, in '96

479
01:21:23,663 --> 01:21:26,384
I can't breathe...

480
01:21:26,624 --> 01:21:32,665
I'm scared. Please don't kill me, sir

481
01:21:42,108 --> 01:21:43,348
Wait just a minute

482
01:22:05,514 --> 01:22:07,874
This is Yoo Jae-kyoung, 2000

483
01:22:14,516 --> 01:22:16,556
Mommy

484
01:23:02,248 --> 01:23:06,009
He was a teacher at English schools
in affluent neighbourhoods

485
01:23:06,969 --> 01:23:12,451
He'd pick his victim, kidnap and kill
them, then move on to another school

486
01:23:13,451 --> 01:23:16,572
He'd never pick a child from one of
his own classes

487
01:23:16,812 --> 01:23:17,852
Which is why he was never under
any suspicion

488
01:23:18,052 --> 01:23:19,972
Coffee or green tea?

489
01:23:21,653 --> 01:23:26,774
Children annoyed him, so he would
tape them right after kidnapping them...

490
01:23:27,094 --> 01:23:29,095
And killed them straight away

491
01:23:29,775 --> 01:23:35,496
The voices you heard on the line while
negotiating the ransom...

492
01:23:35,656 --> 01:23:39,618
...were taped off the videos
after the kids were already dead

493
01:23:43,579 --> 01:23:46,259
Now, you have two options

494
01:23:47,219 --> 01:23:49,780
If you want lawful punishment...

495
01:23:50,180 --> 01:23:53,781
We will hand him over to
Chief Choi here

496
01:23:54,061 --> 01:23:57,502
But if you want a speedier
more personalized death for him...

497
01:23:57,702 --> 01:24:01,023
You can have it right here and now

498
01:24:01,223 --> 01:24:03,224
Does he have a child of his own?

499
01:24:04,464 --> 01:24:08,185
He is supposed to be sterile

500
01:24:08,345 --> 01:24:10,665
Then what did he need all that
money for?

501
01:24:12,946 --> 01:24:15,067
He put it in the bank

502
01:24:15,267 --> 01:24:17,867
Of course, the money will all be returned
to you...

503
01:24:18,107 --> 01:24:21,188
With no kid, what did he need all that
money for?

504
01:24:35,592 --> 01:24:39,793
He... was going to buy a yacht

505
01:24:47,595 --> 01:24:52,756
The police have big sticks but they
don't know how to use them

506
01:24:52,916 --> 01:24:57,357
If we leave it to them, there'd be nothing
but never-ending trials...

507
01:24:57,597 --> 01:24:59,078
And all those bloody reporters...

508
01:24:59,758 --> 01:25:02,359
How about we leave it to Geum-ja?

509
01:25:02,559 --> 01:25:05,919
It'd be easier since she's been to jail
and all

510
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:09,520
That's cowardly! They're our kids

511
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:14,442
Then, let each person choose if
they want to be in or not

512
01:25:14,642 --> 01:25:16,282
I'm for individual choice

513
01:25:16,442 --> 01:25:19,163
Why don't you just let him choose
his own death or trial, then...

514
01:25:19,443 --> 01:25:20,483
Individually?

515
01:25:20,683 --> 01:25:23,084
Little while ago, you wanted to hand him
over to the police

516
01:25:23,284 --> 01:25:25,084
Then you wanted to leave it up
to Geum-ja...

517
01:25:25,284 --> 01:25:27,805
Now you want to be left out alone?
What the hell do you want?

518
01:25:28,205 --> 01:25:30,686
Won-mo's family has to follow the
majority, too

519
01:25:51,691 --> 01:25:55,332
You know that, right?

520
01:25:55,492 --> 01:25:57,573
She has a weak heart...

521
01:25:59,733 --> 01:26:02,294
Hey, mine's weak, too

522
01:26:02,734 --> 01:26:05,135
Then Won-mo's father can represent
the family

523
01:26:05,495 --> 01:26:08,455
One person per family should
be enough

524
01:26:08,936 --> 01:26:09,896
Alright?

525
01:26:10,056 --> 01:26:12,616
What if Won-mo's mom informs
on us later?

526
01:26:13,217 --> 01:26:16,097
She couldn't. Her husband's in on it, too

527
01:26:16,337 --> 01:26:18,298
They could always get divorced

528
01:26:18,938 --> 01:26:21,419
We can leave some evidence, then

529
01:26:21,619 --> 01:26:24,860
How about we all take a picture?
So that...

530
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:28,501
...even if we feel guilty later...-Guilty?

531
01:26:28,781 --> 01:26:30,741
Guilt for killing that bastard?

532
01:26:31,021 --> 01:26:35,062
We'd feel guilty if we didn't kill him
when we had him. That's guilt!

533
01:26:35,422 --> 01:26:37,583
Let me say a word

534
01:26:42,464 --> 01:26:45,905
I killed when I was in prison...

535
01:26:46,985 --> 01:26:50,946
I'm also the one who caught Baek after
13 years of planning...

536
01:26:52,587 --> 01:26:57,148
If anyone here informs the police...

537
01:27:00,469 --> 01:27:02,989
I won't say any more

538
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:08,831
Shall we go in one at a time?
Or all together at once?

539
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:12,152
One at a time for what?
Let's just go finish him off

540
01:27:12,312 --> 01:27:15,753
There's no need to share such a
personal matter with other families

541
01:27:16,193 --> 01:27:17,753
Isn't that right, dad?

542
01:27:21,434 --> 01:27:25,715
Won't it be scary going in alone?
And it could be dangerous

543
01:27:25,915 --> 01:27:27,636
Just think of it as using the toilet

544
01:27:29,156 --> 01:27:31,357
In any case, it's a private affair

545
01:27:31,517 --> 01:27:34,677
Each to his own. A la carte...

546
01:27:35,037 --> 01:27:38,918
We don't all have to get the same
set menu

547
01:27:39,079 --> 01:27:40,919
Please, honey...

548
01:27:42,559 --> 01:27:46,600
We're divorced
This isn't a couples thing!

549
01:27:47,161 --> 01:27:49,561
We don't have to go in together

550
01:27:52,562 --> 01:27:57,803
Excuse me, I think...

551
01:27:59,364 --> 01:28:02,244
-It'd be too easy if we did it all together
-Honey!

552
01:28:05,085 --> 01:28:09,086
I brought along a sedative

553
01:28:11,047 --> 01:28:17,528
You couldn't even touch that finger
remember?

554
01:28:24,610 --> 01:28:26,651
Alright, then...

555
01:28:30,852 --> 01:28:34,293
Won-mo's father is out, and his mother
will go in alone...

556
01:28:34,533 --> 01:28:37,333
...Jae-kyoung's and Dong-hwa's are
going in together...

557
01:28:38,534 --> 01:28:40,934
Is that right? -Yes!

558
01:28:41,534 --> 01:28:42,695
Let's do it then!

559
01:28:44,455 --> 01:28:47,136
Wait! Just a second!

560
01:28:52,017 --> 01:28:55,978
Shouldn't we decide what order you
go in?

561
01:29:47,351 --> 01:29:49,912
Will that be enough for you?

562
01:29:52,192 --> 01:29:54,633
I can lend you mine after

563
01:29:55,793 --> 01:29:57,074
Well...

564
01:30:01,435 --> 01:30:03,195
I think I'll be okay

565
01:30:17,239 --> 01:30:18,759
Honey...

566
01:30:30,762 --> 01:30:32,363
Everyone pay attention

567
01:30:33,603 --> 01:30:38,444
If you grip it like this, the tip of the
knife will slip and not penetrate deeply

568
01:30:38,724 --> 01:30:41,125
You could also cut your hand

569
01:30:41,245 --> 01:30:47,527
So grip it like this at all times, please

570
01:30:47,727 --> 01:30:51,688
Or you could just...

571
01:30:51,928 --> 01:30:58,649
...stab him like this

572
01:31:25,336 --> 01:31:27,937
Why did you do it?

573
01:31:30,537 --> 01:31:34,979
You look like a normal person

574
01:31:35,179 --> 01:31:41,180
Why?

575
01:31:46,221 --> 01:31:52,063
Ma'am, there's no such thing as
a perfect person

576
01:32:47,357 --> 01:32:49,037
This...

577
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:55,999
...isn't going to bring our son back
is it, honey?

578
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:58,920
Right?

579
01:33:17,605 --> 01:33:22,286
You all look very well off
Take a look at that

580
01:33:22,486 --> 01:33:27,567
She took her boots off, so's not to get
blood on the suede

581
01:33:27,887 --> 01:33:29,848
Does that make any sense to you here?

582
01:33:33,089 --> 01:33:39,530
My mom had to scrub hotel floors to
send my brother to that school

583
01:33:40,331 --> 01:33:45,012
We ran around like dogs to come up
with the ransom

584
01:33:45,292 --> 01:33:50,573
Now we've lost our house and our
relatives won't see us

585
01:33:51,893 --> 01:33:55,774
My daughter-in-law killed herself and
my son left the country

586
01:33:56,455 --> 01:33:59,135
We all have our own stories to tell

587
01:34:12,499 --> 01:34:13,419
Dad!

588
01:34:14,259 --> 01:34:19,020
We're not the last, dad. Eun-joo's
grandma's still waiting her turn

589
01:34:23,662 --> 01:34:25,342
Dad...

590
01:34:38,105 --> 01:34:40,106
Come on, give me a hand!

591
01:34:42,626 --> 01:34:44,347
Mister, get up

592
01:34:44,547 --> 01:34:48,028
Please. Get a hold of yourself!

593
01:37:39,351 --> 01:37:41,032
I'm sorry, but...

594
01:37:42,712 --> 01:37:46,273
Could you step aside a moment?

595
01:38:21,162 --> 01:38:22,442
Thank you

596
01:39:54,346 --> 01:39:59,227
Happy birthday to you...

597
01:40:07,189 --> 01:40:13,151
Happy birthday to you...

598
01:40:13,671 --> 01:40:20,312
Happy birthday dear...

599
01:40:30,115 --> 01:40:31,835
I'm sorry

600
01:40:33,476 --> 01:40:35,876
It felt like a birthday to me...

601
01:40:38,157 --> 01:40:40,358
We can say it is, then

602
01:40:41,278 --> 01:40:42,198
Happy birthday...

603
01:40:42,398 --> 01:40:48,240
...to you!

604
01:41:39,533 --> 01:41:42,053
Will you wire the money into
our accounts?

605
01:41:50,575 --> 01:41:52,776
My account number

606
01:42:02,939 --> 01:42:05,339
In France...

607
01:42:06,299 --> 01:42:09,180
...when there's a break in the
conversation like this...

608
01:42:09,740 --> 01:42:13,341
...they say an angel is passing

609
01:43:38,123 --> 01:43:39,763
It's snowing!

610
01:43:42,724 --> 01:43:44,765
It's snowing a lot

611
01:43:45,125 --> 01:43:47,765
-When did it all pile up so much?
-What time is it now?

612
01:43:48,405 --> 01:43:49,686
The traffic...

613
01:43:49,886 --> 01:43:51,526
The roads will freeze soon

614
01:45:07,706 --> 01:45:09,026
Won-mo

615
01:45:14,547 --> 01:45:16,028
I have...

616
01:46:22,405 --> 01:46:24,685
Along the path on green grass...

617
01:46:24,965 --> 01:46:28,846
A lady in red heels goes...

618
01:46:29,326 --> 01:46:36,248
Click, click, click with her heels
Where might she be going?

619
01:46:37,649 --> 01:46:42,050
Won't she look back...

620
01:46:42,090 --> 01:46:43,850
Are you really going to send Jenny back?

621
01:46:44,130 --> 01:46:47,331
...back my way for a glance?

622
01:46:47,771 --> 01:46:48,851
Are you?

623
01:46:49,532 --> 01:46:53,773
One step, two...

624
01:46:54,173 --> 01:47:00,774
The lady in red heels takes another
step away, alone...

625
01:47:15,218 --> 01:47:21,700
Lee Geum-ja made a great mistake
in her youth...

626
01:47:22,020 --> 01:47:25,141
And used other people to achieve
her own goals...

627
01:47:25,341 --> 01:47:31,862
But she still couldn't find the redemption
she so desired

628
01:47:48,107 --> 01:47:50,027
In spite of this...

629
01:47:50,267 --> 01:47:52,068
Actually, because of this...

630
01:47:53,468 --> 01:47:57,749
I liked Geum-ja

631
01:51:11,438 --> 01:51:12,959
Farewell...

632
01:51:13,439 --> 01:51:14,999
...Geum-ja

633
