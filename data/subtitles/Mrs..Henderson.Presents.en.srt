1
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,992
For as much as it has pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy,

2
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:45,519
to take unto himself the soul
of our dear brother here departed...

3
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,558
...we therefore commit his body
to the ground...

4
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,637
...earth to earth,

5
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,711
ashes to ashes...

6
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,758
...dust to dust.

7
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,875
So sorry, my dear Mrs Henderson.

8
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,793
Your husband
was a great friend to my country.

9
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,473
That's so kind of you.

10
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,717
Please join us at the house
for a small luncheon in his honour.

11
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,909
Thank you so much, Leslie...
but I think I'll take my own car.

12
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,197
Madam.

13
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,239
I know that Robert would want me to be
available to help you in any way.

14
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,391
Thank you so much.

15
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,829
- He was an estimable man.
- Yes. Yes.

16
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,195
And a very dangerous
business competitor.

17
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,679
Yes.

18
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,711
Oh. Please.

19
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,511
Excuse me.

20
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,111
I am bored with widowhood.

21
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,276
My dear,
you've just scratched the surface.

22
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,874
I have to smile at everybody.
I've never had to do that.

23
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,349
In India, there were always people
to look down on.

24
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,239
People are simply being sympathetic.

25
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,630
After all, you have lost your husband.

26
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,028
I didn't mislay him.

27
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,634
It was most inconsiderate
of Robert to die.

28
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,394
What on earth
am I supposed to do now?

29
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,516
The first rule of widowhood, my dear -

30
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,831
important conversations occur at lunch.

31
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,872
It's really not so bad.

32
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,275
Widows are allowed hobbies.

33
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,112
- Hobbies?
- Yes.

34
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:46,038
- Embroidery. Things like that.
- Are you mad?

35
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,958
I graduated to weaving.

36
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,157
- Would you care to see my tapestries?
- I'd rather drink ink.

37
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,550
Committees are good, of course.

38
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,159
I serve on quite a few.

39
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:56,349
Charities.

40
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,758
Once your husband dies,
it's quite permissible to help the poor.

41
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:05,519
And now there's no-one
to stop you buying things.

42
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,032
Also, of course, there's
a great deal of time for lovers.

43
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,357
- Margot, I'm nearly 70.
- That's true.

44
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,596
But you're also very rich.

45
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,478
The one cancels out the other.

46
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,559
I don't know anything
about embroidery.

47
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:39,837
Ow! Oh!

48
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,312
Now, I believe we may call it a refuge.

49
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,951
Certainly we do not want any term
alluding to unwed mothers in the title.

50
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,711
Nor do we wish for the public to know
the purpose of the house.

51
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,435
But I've told all my friends I'm helping
to build a home for future bastards.

52
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,239
Sorry.

53
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,311
- Home, madam?
- I need some fresh air. Let's drive.

54
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,588
Yes, madam.

55
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,512
I think I should see Alec.

56
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,430
Hello, Alec.

57
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,711
Let's return to London, please.

58
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,471
I'd rather like to visit
old Windmill Street again.

59
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,033
Good day, madam.

60
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,751
Oh.

61
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,431
- Mind your back.
- Oh!

62
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,875
- Oh, Laura, what on earth?
- Margo.

63
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,951
Renovations, dear.

64
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,429
- But it's a...
- Theatre.

65
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,716
It's a theatre. Isn't it delicious?

66
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,034
- I own it.
- Own it?

67
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,919
You told me now there was no-one
to stop me from buying things,

68
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,439
so I bought a theatre.

69
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,671
I meant bracelets and earrings.

70
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,469
What on earth are you going to do
with a theatre?

71
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,310
Well, I thought music hall, or - what do
they call it in America - vaudeville?

72
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,276
Actually, I haven't thought about it.

73
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,118
Oh, dear.
What am I going to do with it?

74
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:04,549
Clearly you need someone
to run it for you.

75
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,954
Oh, you think?

76
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,270
Oh, I knew you'd give me
sensible advice.

77
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,035
But who?

78
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,877
Well, that's an easy assignment.
I know just the man.

79
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:20,831
He's out of work at the moment,
but he's very good at running theatres.

80
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,997
I can't imagine where she is.

81
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,270
She was meant to be here
20 minutes ago.

82
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,997
Well...

83
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,519
...that's that, then.

84
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,910
I can't hang around here all morning.
I've an important meeting to go to.

85
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,119
- I'm sorry, old chum...
- Oh, he was terribly ill in the car.

86
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,555
Nerves, I imagine. Little sweet!

87
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,875
Hello, Leslie.
- Hello.

88
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,313
Who on earth are you?

89
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,278
- This is Vivian Van Damm.
- Don't be silly.

90
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,158
That's not a British name.

91
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:55,636
In actual fact,
my father's a lawyer in Bishopsgate.

92
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,037
Although some of his ancestors
are from Holland.

93
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,708
- Oh, dear God, you're Jewish!
- As it happens, I'm not.

94
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,348
Well, of course you are, dear.
Just look at yourself.

95
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:08,479
The show business is filled with Jewish
people, isn't it? One must make do.

96
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,557
We haven't met. I'm Laura Henderson.

97
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,557
Yes, I imagined you were.

98
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,672
You're 20 minutes late,
and you're rude.

99
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,796
- Perhaps he's the wrong man.
- No, I don't think so.

100
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,911
Where are you going?

101
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,240
Leslie, where is he off to? Do stop him.

102
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,311
I'm here to offer you a position!

103
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,432
You can't offer me a position
if I'm walking out on you.

104
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,556
But that's why I'm offering it, dear.

105
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,318
You've got gumption.

106
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,112
Oh, don't you adore that word?

107
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,117
And you're smoking a cigar.

108
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,629
Anyone who runs my theatre
must smoke a cigar.

109
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,472
It's so manly. And so...

110
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,749
What?

111
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,795
Jewish.

112
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,997
I have a theatre.

113
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,590
I have a theatre.

114
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,595
It's just sitting there,
waiting for a brilliant manager

115
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,314
to come and turn it into
a commercial proposition.

116
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,948
A manager who might bring
some enjoyment and amusement

117
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,679
back into the West End.

118
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,109
A manager with vision and courage.

119
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,399
And if that isn't you,
then my intuition has failed me.

120
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,269
So, by all means, hurry off,
Mr Damm Van.

121
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,799
Van Damm.

122
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,952
Oh, if you insist, dear. If you insist.

123
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,868
Whose idea was it to gut the building?

124
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,553
- Mine.
- Well, well.

125
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,154
There should be a sign saying
Windmill Theatre. Up there. See?

126
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,839
You're going to retain the name?

127
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,350
Well, I find it helps your driver
if the theatre is named after the street.

128
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,875
What do you know
about the theatre business?

129
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,029
Almost nothing.

130
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,876
I have to have total control
of the production side. Is that clear?

131
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,839
All artistic decisions are mine.

132
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,629
You may voice an opinion, if you must,
but I have the final say.

133
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,751
- Understood?
- Of course.

134
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,519
I think we'll make a splendid team.

135
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:12,915
Let's go and sit down
in that charming little café.

136
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,589
I'm sure its business will improve
when our musical revue opens.

137
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,040
Who said we were doing
a musical revue?

138
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,593
Well, I assumed.

139
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,513
All those decisions are mine.
Remember?

140
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,354
That's perfect. Just there.

141
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,431
Higher.

142
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,518
No. No, no, no. Come back.
Come back to the middle.

143
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,113
Higher.

144
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,189
Higher.

145
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,033
Fine. I've had an idea. Let's go inside.

146
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,910
It is a radical idea.

147
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,909
Oh, jolly good. What is it?

148
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:56,954
Non-stop performances.

149
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:58,149
- Non-stop?
- Yes.

150
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,913
Instead of two shows a day,
we run our show all day long.

151
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,918
Five or six performances a day,
one after another.

152
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,792
It's never been done in England before.

153
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,389
Every theatre here
is exactly like every other theatre.

154
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,875
No-one is attempting anything new.

155
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,712
It's good to stir things up,
don't you think?

156
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,348
We'd be a sensation.

157
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,597
I've no idea what you're on about,
but I do admire passion.

158
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,671
Yes, well... what else is there?

159
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,588
How much will this experiment cost?

160
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,189
I mean,
what do I stand to lose if it fails?

161
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,517
Well, anything up to er... £10,000.

162
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,555
What fun!

163
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,958
I'm in a sporting mood today,
Mr Van Damm. It must be the weather.

164
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,753
- And what'll we do?
- A musical revue.

165
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,034
What will we call it?

166
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,037
Well, I thought Revudeville.

167
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,111
Oh, yes!

168
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,153
That's lovely.

169
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,594
Ladies and gentlemen...

170
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,188
...I've invited you here this evening
to sip a bit of sherry -

171
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,479
I'm told cocktail parties
are out-of-date -

172
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,195
and to announce
the most amusing news.

173
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,559
The Windmill Theatre
will open on February 3rd,

174
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,233
with the most revolutionary programme
ever seen in England.

175
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,035
In this enterprise, I shall be carrying on
the work of my late husband,

176
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:37,309
who spent a great deal of time
and money helping stage people,

177
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,956
especially those in the field of variety.

178
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,711
- Is that true?
- She's making it up.

179
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,511
Oh.

180
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,392
As you well know,
these are difficult times,

181
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,196
so many of our delightful
variety performers

182
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,358
have been forced onto the milk line.

183
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,630
- Bread line.
- Bread line. Bread line.

184
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,471
Revudeville is an attempt to create...

185
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,631
- Employment.
... employment.

186
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,110
Employment...
for these delightful creatures.

187
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,309
Our productions will be guided
and overseen by our resident genius,

188
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:10,959
Our brilliant general manager,
who comes to us from Central Europe,

189
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,397
Mr Vivian Van Damm.

190
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,755
We won't be able to work together,
you know that.

191
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,711
You're a perfect match.

192
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,268
So, you found yourself a continental.

193
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,155
Nonsense. He's as English as you or I.

194
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,595
But he's terribly alive, don't you think?
It's just something one can sense.

195
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:41,110
- Laura, you have an infatuation.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.

196
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,270
It's the show business I'm attracted to.

197
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,515
Tomorrow we have auditions!
Isn't that exciting?

198
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,598
People come in and entertain us

199
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,796
and we say either
"stick around" or "buzz off. "

200
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:03,995
- Thank you, that'll do.
Poor thing.

201
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:06,838
- Next!
- My dear, would you wait over there?

202
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,718
Mr Van Damm, I spent many years
in the Far East with my husband

203
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,475
witnessing what one might call
pagan rituals,

204
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,196
but I've never seen anything
as barbaric as this.

205
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,839
Welcome to the theatre.

206
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,838
Next!
Very nice, dear.

207
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,759
Buy yourself a decent meal.

208
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,478
Who's the young man at the back?

209
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,596
Ssh! Concentrate on the auditions.

210
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,518
We'll have him.

211
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,669
We will?

212
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,275
We will.

213
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,753
Next!

214
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,951
Why do you keep looking at that boy?

215
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,556
That boy, as you call him,
was the featured performer at the Pavilion.

216
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,278
We snatched him away.

217
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,273
He can be a big help to me.
He's got excellent taste.

218
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,914
He seems to agree
with all of my choices.

219
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,792
Including these
demented pharaohs?

220
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,518
- Book them.
- Right, VD.

221
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,749
Are you mad?

222
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,717
They're not in the least authentic.

223
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,393
And over, over,
step, shuffle, change. Riff, pick up, toe.

224
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,160
Pick up and five, six, seven, eight.

225
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,555
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up again.

226
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:57,238
Maxie Ford and heads up.

227
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:00,278
Thank you,
ladies. Change over. Quickly, girls!

228
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,829
See what they're like
from the back of the stalls.

229
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,752
Pay attention to their height.

230
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,630
And over. Step, shuffle and change.

231
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,153
Riff, pick up, toe.

232
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,038
Tap, tap, change, pick up, step,
and round, two, three, four.

233
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,595
Pick up, step, pick up, step,
pick up and change.

234
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,472
Maxie Ford and heads up.

235
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,278
Do you find these women attractive?

236
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,278
- Some of them are very pretty.
- Oh, yes, I can certainly see that.

237
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,557
But... do they intrigue you as a man?

238
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,553
- I have other inclinations.
- Oh.

239
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,598
Oh! Oh, how delicious!

240
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,911
And use your backs.

241
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,429
Yes, girls. Next group.

242
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,791
And use your back, girls.

243
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,592
Yes! Last group.

244
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,554
But Mr Van Damm seems to have
an intense appreciation, doesn't he?

245
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,394
Other girls, ready. And!

246
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,591
He's practically sniffing them.

247
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,358
And last group.

248
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,600
- Some of these girls are very good.
- Indeed.

249
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,871
I'm going to call our chorus
The Millerettes.

250
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:12,315
- Millerettes?
- Mill, as in Windmill.

251
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,793
- What's the "er" for?
- What?

252
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,996
Millerettes. It should be Millettes.

253
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,354
The "er" clogs it up.

254
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,590
- Millettes doesn't scan.
- But it's accurate.

255
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,039
It doesn't sound right.

256
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,958
Millerettes sounds like a man
named Miller has a chorus line.

257
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,111
We're doing a vaudeville,
not a dictionary.

258
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,434
It isn't correct English!

259
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,159
Millerettes is a good name.
And it's not your decision.

260
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,111
In fact, it's got nothing to do with you.

261
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,038
In fact, you shouldn't be in the theatre
until dress rehearsal.

262
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,356
- In fact, I'm going to ban you!
- Don't you dare!

263
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,199
- I'm banning you from all auditions.
- You haven't the right.

264
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,834
- I can do anything I please.
- I shall cancel the opening.

265
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,989
Fine!

266
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,350
- This show will not goon!
- Indeed.

267
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,596
They're ready to start again, VD.

268
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,917
My dear, you must never interrupt
a perfectly good argument.

269
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,156
- I've lost my train of thought.
- So have I.

270
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,838
Come on.
Mustn't keep The Millerettes waiting.

271
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,558
Oh, that name's intolerable.

272
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,756
It suggests midgets
working in a factory.

273
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,348
Millettes sounds like
a medical condition.

274
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,831
Thank you, Mr Van Damm.

275
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,554
Thank you, Mrs Henderson.

276
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:13,797
Stop thanking each other.
Let's find some champagne.

277
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,837
Oh, what a wonderful hobby, my dear.

278
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:19,600
I wonder if there are
any more theatres for sale.

279
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,430
I don't understand.
We were such a success.

280
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,596
And then everyone copied us.

281
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,433
- You're telling me we're a disaster?
- Here's the accounts.

282
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:48,272
You're losing a fortune.

283
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,358
You mean you can be a triumph
one week and a disaster the next?

284
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,516
I'm not certain it's worth going on.

285
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,910
Oh, you people make me weary!

286
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,633
You've no courage.

287
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,354
What I say is, stick a thing out
and it will come right.

288
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,476
I'm trying to save your finances.

289
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:05,473
I don't need your protection,
thank you very much.

290
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,558
We've put on good shows, but they're
obviously not daring enough.

291
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,352
Why don't we get rid of the clothes?

292
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,549
Pardon?

293
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,557
Let's have naked girls.

294
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,313
Don't you think?

295
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,516
Now, this has been on my mind
for some time.

296
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:23,638
I never dared mention it.
I too lack courage, it seems.

297
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,798
Now, what I propose is that we have
nude women in Revudeville.

298
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,359
As they do in Paris.

299
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,630
At our namesake, the Moulin Rouge,
for instance.

300
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,638
Oh, Baby, we'll find you some milk.

301
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:38,191
Paris, after all, is just filled with
naked women wearing bananas,

302
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,994
and dare I say, making everyone else
go bananas in return.

303
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,589
- Do keep up, Mr Van Damm.
- Yes.

304
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,751
It would be innovative
and draw the crowds.

305
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,558
I would make back all of my money.

306
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:51,150
You, I imagine, would enjoy yourself,
being surrounded by countless breasts,

307
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,237
and we'd all be happy.

308
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,477
What you're suggesting
isn't possible.

309
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,517
That kind of thing
isn't done here.

310
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,113
Nudity? In England?

311
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,794
You tend towards safety sometimes,
Mr Van Damm.

312
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,632
You're rather bourgeois.

313
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:06,193
I do mean that in a kind way.

314
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,039
But I suspect it's not advisable
in the show business.

315
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,556
What you're forgetting is we need
a licence from the Lord Chamberlain

316
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,320
for whatever we put on the stage.
He'll never approve it.

317
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,835
- The Lord Chamberlain?
- Yes, The Lord Chamberlain.

318
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:22,191
What, Tommy? Little Tommy Baring?
Oh, don't be silly!

319
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,470
I have, of course,
taken that into account.

320
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,993
He's a very sweet man.

321
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,754
He and his rather dreary wife
are on holiday in France,

322
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,195
but as soon as he returns,
I'll throw a fly at him.

323
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,315
Pardon?

324
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,477
That's a fisherman's term, dear.
It has to do with hooking a trout.

325
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,153
You do lead a narrow life.

326
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,748
Meanwhile, do begin work
on our marvellous new idea.

327
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,353
Without permission?

328
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,835
Oh! We've found your milk!

329
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,555
Mrs Henderson's request is,
of course, entirely out of order.

330
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,671
Of course. I'm well aware of that.

331
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:56,199
- Oh, Tommy!
- Laura, how wonderful to see you.

332
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,397
- You don't look a day older.
- What a touching little lie.

333
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,478
I do know a bit about why you're here,
you know.

334
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,551
- Oh?
- Hm.

335
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,549
I find that lines have to be drawn
somewhere, my dear Laura,

336
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:13,389
and nudity
is on the wrong side of the divide.

337
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,433
I have problems enough
with the length of skirts.

338
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,832
I've had to have inches added to them
for the new Offenbach production.

339
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,793
Well, we won't have that problem
as we won't have skirts.

340
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,951
Sir? If I may?

341
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,271
We have very strict rules
in these areas, Mrs Henderson.

342
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,278
Oh, this office is so stuffy.

343
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,839
Why don't we take a bit of a walk?

344
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,430
- Sir?
- A walk. Yes. Lovely.

345
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,710
Why didn't you return to India?

346
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,599
I was only ever Robert's wife in India.

347
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,320
It seemed a bit absurd
without a Robert.

348
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:50,393
Now I find it most amusing to run
a variety show, and I'll tell you why.

349
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,278
Robert took me to music hall
quite often - he was fond of them -

350
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,194
On condition that I stayed behind the
curtain in a box and was never visible.

351
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,755
In those days, it was considered
terribly improper

352
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,309
for a married woman
to be seen at a music hall.

353
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,231
But times have moved on.

354
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:09,191
And we must move with them,
mustn't we?

355
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,831
Oh, look! A tent!

356
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:14,796
It's unusual to see a tent in the park.

357
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,114
Quite so.

358
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,793
I had it constructed this morning.

359
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,233
Did you obtain a licence?

360
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,157
Oh, come inside, you old fogey.

361
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,191
I've prepared lunch.

362
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,918
But the be-all and end-all, finally,
is that they are naked.

363
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,599
Like paintings. In a museum.

364
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,796
These sandwiches
are particularly good.

365
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,036
It's an excellent season for salmon.

366
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,316
We haven't exactly reached
salmon season yet.

367
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,556
Tommy, you're so literal.

368
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,399
You're thinking bosoms,
but I'm thinking breasts.

369
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,677
- What is the difference?
- The difference is in your soul.

370
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,791
- Cheese?
- Thank you.

371
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:53,751
Of course, paintings in a museum
are still, are they not?

372
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,675
Still?

373
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,797
The figures do not move.
I suppose there's something in that.

374
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,871
Mm, this cheese is very good indeed.

375
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,951
If the girls did not move...

376
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,030
Tableaux?

377
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,394
Precisely.

378
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,149
Then one might make a direct corollary
with an art gallery.

379
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,670
I can perhaps see the possibility
of some artistic merit.

380
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,591
- They never move?
- Never.

381
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,472
Yes, that would be like a museum.

382
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,558
Which was, my dear, your suggestion,
so you must be very pleased.

383
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,353
I'm warming to the idea.

384
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,596
- My secretary would be appalled...
- More wine?

385
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,352
Ah, yes, thank you.

386
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,152
Now, what about...

387
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,952
forgive me... the foliage?

388
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,394
Foliage?

389
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,033
You know... beneath the...

390
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,430
- Beneath what? Try the brie.
- Thank you.

391
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,272
- Beneath...
- Flown in from France.

392
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:44,756
- Excellent. The foliage beneath the...
- My husband was very fond of it.

393
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,757
- Of what?
- This particular cheese.

394
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,676
My dear, I am attempting to address

395
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,912
the disagreeable and somewhat
sordid topic of the pudendum.

396
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,111
- What on earth is that?
- Good heavens, woman!

397
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,396
- Have some more wine.
- The female part.

398
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:58,669
Oh! The pussy!

399
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,397
Why didn't you say?

400
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,478
I had not expected you, of all people,
to use such language.

401
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,029
That word was popular
in the mid-nineteenth century.

402
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,316
Not everyone speaks Latin, you know.

403
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:13,155
Then I'd prefer you refer to it as...
the midlands.

404
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,271
Oh, dear.

405
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:19,109
You men do get into such a state
about the midlands, don't you?

406
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,753
Well, you needn't worry.

407
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,715
Our lighting will be so subtle,
the disputed area will be barely visible.

408
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:28,033
Anyway, we'll have a barber.

409
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,751
You are the most exasperating woman!
You always were.

410
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,190
I take that to mean
you'll permit us to have a go.

411
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,515
As long as no-one moves, yes.

412
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,794
Perhaps.

413
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,390
I reserve final judgment...
until opening night.

414
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,197
I'm delighted, dear ladies, that you all
wish to be a part of our endeavour.

415
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,351
Thank you very much.

416
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,636
- Saliva.
- Behave!

417
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,196
I've never realised
how similar breasts are to shoes.

418
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:11,356
- What do you mean?
- They come in so many sizes.

419
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,914
I've always found them
rather overrated, myself.

420
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,599
Well, you're not a man.

421
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,119
Alas.

422
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,475
All right, ladies. Off you go.

423
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,511
What do you make of her?

424
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,756
- She's beautiful.
- Yes.

425
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,036
But the nipples...
Too large?

426
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,350
They're not British.
Could be Italian.

427
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,191
We must have British nipples.

428
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,751
And how about her?

429
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,671
The right one's bigger than the left.

430
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,510
Her.

431
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,279
Fried eggs.

432
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,429
Sorry.

433
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:09,715
Thank you very much. Could you all
please wait in the wings? Thank you.

434
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,752
- What, basically, are you looking for?
- Personality.

435
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,036
Something in their smile, their eyes.

436
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,998
Well, I suggest you start looking
in their faces.

437
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,393
Yes, of course!

438
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,556
We're looking at the wrong kind of girl.

439
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,477
We shouldn't have theatricals.

440
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,909
- Maggie, make a note.
- My dear?

441
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,509
Bertie and I
are going to tour the countryside

442
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,238
and discover some English roses.

443
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,352
Oh, good!
Now you're getting the hang of it.

444
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,589
It's been an unsuccessful trip,
my friend.

445
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:46,752
What I'm looking for is... personality.

446
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,514
Youth. Beauty.

447
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,591
Certainly not talent.

448
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,278
Anyone can have talent.

449
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,356
And they must be well brought up.

450
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,517
I think many of the young women
we've been seeing

451
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,148
come from
rather awkward backgrounds.

452
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:13,676
Shine the light on the water!

453
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,553
Don't panic! The young fellow's
a dancer. Excellent coordination.

454
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,870
That's it. Pull her... That's it.

455
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,669
Come on. There we go. There you are.

456
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,474
- You're all right.
- Let me see.

457
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,551
Oh, my God!

458
00:34:42,160 --> 00:34:44,435
I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed.

459
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,278
I didn't mean to cause any trouble.

460
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,949
No need to be embarrassed.
You've found a knight.

461
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,835
Two knights, in shining armour.

462
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,157
My God! What a beautiful smile!

463
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,719
Exquisite.

464
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:06,792
Have you ever considered
going on the stage?

465
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,872
You moved.

466
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:38,031
- She mustn't move!
- I'm sorry, Mr Van Damm.

467
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,238
The law insists
that you be absolutely still.

468
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,392
- Why don't we take a break?
- Yes, good idea.

469
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,791
Rest your arms, girls.
Get the circulation going.

470
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:55,839
- There's er... teacups and...
- Tea.

471
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,270
...tea just downstairs.

472
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,549
Oh! Oh, it's so sweet!

473
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,718
You're perched in the orchestra pit
like little birds.

474
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,791
It feels safe down here.

475
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,031
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you. My arm went numb.

476
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,994
I would sometimes see people in India
standing still for hours on end, my dear.

477
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,708
They were called fakirs.
It was all rather spiritual.

478
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,029
Oh, I see.

479
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,515
You must think yourself
onto a higher plane.

480
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,234
We'd all like to be on a higher plane
now, Mrs Henderson.

481
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,233
Preferably flying over the Channel.

482
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,880
- Oh, you're the one that was...
- Drowning.

483
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,714
- Come on.
- I like that girl you ran over.

484
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,270
Why don't you and the dog have a look
at the programme proofs in the office?

485
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,199
- You're trying to get rid of us.
- It's a delicate time.

486
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,753
All the more reason for
a motherly presence.

487
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,195
Maggie!
Take Mrs Henderson to the office.

488
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,992
- Out!
- Well, of course.

489
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,359
You're in charge.

490
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,278
Right.

491
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,675
Time for you to disrobe.

492
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,313
Do we have to do it now,
Mr Van Damm?

493
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,874
- Well, when else?
- I was just asking.

494
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:08,390
- Should have left you in the water.
- Come on, girls, let's do it.

495
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,639
I can't!

496
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:28,272
Where's she going?
- She can't face it.

497
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,392
What's wrong with everybody?

498
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,471
I'm sorry, Mr Van Damm.

499
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,592
There's no work outside.

500
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,910
I just thought, well it's a job.
All of my friends are starving.

501
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,508
I was... lucky to have employment.
But...

502
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,473
You can't imagine what it feels like,
just standing there.

503
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,471
Not even my boyfriend
has seen me naked.

504
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:54,352
And we've been to bed and everything.

505
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,358
It's like it's... medical.

506
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:01,439
Do you think... I would ever subject you

507
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,108
to anything improper or tawdry?

508
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,239
I am enabling you to earn an honest
salary in this most difficult of times.

509
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,916
After a hard week's work, you can take
home enough to maintain your home,

510
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,516
help out your parents
and even save a little bit for the future.

511
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,148
And all you have to do

512
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,431
is display certain blessings
you received from the Lord.

513
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:28,357
Why do you think God gave you
all your bits and pieces?

514
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,676
So that you might be
ashamed of them?

515
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,711
So that you might hide them away?

516
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,191
Isn't great art, after all,
a celebration of nature?

517
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,039
- That's what this is.
- Art?

518
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,679
Absolutely.

519
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,678
You are the Venus de Milo,
the Mona Lisa...

520
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,512
The Mona Lisa wore a dress.

521
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:51,551
Some do, some don't.

522
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,553
Tomorrow, we'll go to the museum
and look at some paintings.

523
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,634
Botticelli.

524
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:00,671
Now, he was inspired.

525
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,268
Inspired by God.

526
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,159
If I'm placing a weighty burden
on your shoulders,

527
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,869
then I know you have
the moral strength to carry it.

528
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,519
Why don't we try it again?

529
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,471
All right?

530
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,871
I'll see you on the stage.

531
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,471
Come on, girls,
let's give it a go.

532
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,592
I don't fancy working
in my father's chemist.

533
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,953
Art. Art.

534
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:35,429
Sorry.

535
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,835
Actually, there is a draught in here,
Mr Van Damm.

536
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,520
You expect that in a theatre.
You expect draughts.

537
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,108
- But what happens if we catch cold?
- Bertie!

538
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,556
Get someone to close the doors
and check all the windows, will you?

539
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:49,320
Thank you. All right?
- Yes, thank you.

540
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,873
Does everyone have to watch us?

541
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,520
- Who?
- Well, them.

542
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,308
You're going to have
an entire audience watching you.

543
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,038
Yes, but they'll be strangers.

544
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,636
And they won't be standing so close...
will they?

545
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,268
- We can hear them breathing.
- A man has to breathe.

546
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,628
Heavy breathing.

547
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:11,832
After all, it doesn't seem fair for them
to be dressed when we're not.

548
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,355
Okey-doke. I know what to do.

549
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,834
Come on, gentlemen. Come on.
You too.

550
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,712
- What?
- Fair is fair.

551
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:24,031
Let's make the ladies comfortable.

552
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,677
Come on.

553
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,994
Strip.

554
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,271
You too, Mr Van Damm.

555
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,517
Don't be ridiculous. Someone has to
maintain authority here.

556
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:40,716
- Take your clothes off, please.
- No.

557
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,990
Off! Off! Off!

558
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:47,199
Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off!

559
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,312
Off! Off! Off! Off!

560
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,869
All right! All right!

561
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,512
Bloody childish!

562
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:01,110
Mrs Henderson. Mrs Henderson!

563
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,993
Why, Mr Van Damm...

564
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,918
...you are Jewish!

565
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,310
- I think I saw a priest in the audience.
- Oh, stop it! You're hallucinating!

566
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,914
- Everyone looked so rich.
- Oh, I hope so.

567
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:37,553
When I take off my clothes,

568
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:40,200
I close my eyes and think,
"This will bring me champagne. "

569
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:42,788
I think, "One more day
and it hasn't happened yet. "

570
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,993
Oh, my God!

571
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:47,758
I've brought
the Lord Chamberlain.

572
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:50,354
He felt he had to say a few words
of encouragement to you.

573
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,152
Isn't that delicious?

574
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,191
Well done.

575
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,231
Well done. I...

576
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,795
May I be... permitted to say...

577
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,157
...that... Oh, good heavens!

578
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,311
Good heavens! I...

579
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,032
I...

580
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:14,630
What an artistic enterprise er...

581
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,792
you have um...

582
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,997
A testament, really, to the British p...

583
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,193
- It's a magical evening.
- Hm?

584
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:28,509
I quite understand
what you were feeling.

585
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,272
I myself have exhibited my breasts.

586
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,556
I was at a party in Antibes

587
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,830
with The Duchess of Denby
and Countess Volpe,

588
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:41,112
and we took off our blouses -
in private, of course -

589
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,880
and looked at each other's titties.

590
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,191
My, how we laughed!

591
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:52,193
The Lord Chamberlain
was very taken with you, my dear.

592
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,520
- Mrs Henderson.
- Mr Van Damm. Quite an evening.

593
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,471
The Lord Chamberlain
was very pleased.

594
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,511
I wanted you to meet Natalie.

595
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,993
- Natalie?
- My wife.

596
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:09,271
Vivian's spoken about you sooften,
I just feel that I know you.

597
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:16,710
Well... I certainly don't know you!

598
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,791
Excuse me.

599
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:34,470
You can be rude to me,
but not to my wife!

600
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,108
What wife?
When did you acquire a wife?

601
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,198
- Why haven't you told us?
- What do you mean?

602
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,839
You never mentioned her.

603
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:44,793
I believe a figure of authority
must maintain a sense of privacy.

604
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,791
Good heavens! A wife!

605
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,313
What exactly is the problem?

606
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,152
Who on earth said
there was a problem?

607
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,356
Fine. Have a wife, if you insist.

608
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:55,153
Just don't let her interfere
with any of your duties.

609
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,350
- Why would she do that?
- That's what wives do.

610
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,755
That's their purpose. I know.
I was a wife.

611
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,359
I interfered all the time.

612
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,555
So sack me, then!

613
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:05,837
If you're unhappy with me,
just say it and I'll leave!

614
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:10,278
But don't you dare ever, ever
talk to my wife like that again!

615
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:12,670
Oh, don't you worry.
I'll keep my eye on you.

616
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,199
You do that.

617
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,198
I hope you realise I will never, ever,
ever set foot in this theatre again!

618
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,955
You two behave
like an old married couple.

619
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,714
Well, it seems
that would make him a bigamist.

620
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,797
Champagne, then?

621
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,357
It is rather as I thought.

622
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,397
Your heart has stirred.

623
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,477
Then I must consult a physician.

624
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,909
This should have been
such a pleasant night.

625
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,596
- I want you to flank her.
- Flank her?

626
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,519
- Stand either side of her.
- Oh.

627
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,796
Aren't I in silhouette, like in the picture?

628
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,956
- Silhouette.
- Silhouette, Harry!

629
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,271
- And the sun must rise behind you.
- Orange.

630
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:54,155
We see the rays of the sun,
like in the picture.

631
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,758
A new dawn over the New World.

632
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,994
Goody, goody.

633
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,517
Goody, goody.

634
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,759
Goody, goody.

635
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:22,995
And now...

636
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:25,395
- How...
... do you do?

637
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:28,759
Do something!

638
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,589
How will I explain this
to the Lord Chamberlain?

639
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:32,235
Coming through!
Excuse me, Mr Van Damm. Sorry.

640
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,711
I forgot my fin.

641
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,796
It'll have to be tighter than that.

642
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,717
- Good afternoon, Doris.
- Afternoon.

643
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:41,910
- How's your mother?
- She's fine, thank you.

644
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,951
Have you been writing
to her every week?

645
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:47,237
Yes. She told me to tell you
she's very disappointed I'm a starfish.

646
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:50,557
- She thinks I should be a mermaid.
- Ah. I'll send her a note.

647
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,476
- And who have we here?
- Catherine the Great.

648
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,596
Have you forgotten
the tableau of the wars?

649
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,551
Come along, Mr Van Damm.
Wakey-wakey.

650
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,591
You might show a bit more respect.

651
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:03,951
- I think I should have...
... left you in the water.

652
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,919
- Afternoon, girls. How are you?
- Better now, Mr Van Damm.

653
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,315
- Was something wrong?
- My bum cheeks went numb.

654
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:12,711
She was leaning arse over backwards.
In the Alaskan tableau, of course.

655
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,114
All that ice.

656
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,276
But Rupert soon got
the blood flowing!

657
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,038
- Who's Rupert?
- Well you might ask.

658
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,235
Behave yourself!

659
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:23,352
We must be cautious
about too much frivolity.

660
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,431
The Windmill
is a very serious business!

661
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,511
Yes, Mr Van Damm.

662
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,758
- Do I give it to the students again, sir?
- Mr Van Damm.

663
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:41,831
At your own discretion, dear boy.

664
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:45,317
It's beastly.

665
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,277
I can't walk into my own theatre.

666
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:51,235
I hear wonderful things
about the new performances

667
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:52,719
and I'm missing all the fun.

668
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:55,832
You did say you would never set foot
in the The Windmill again.

669
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,036
Quite right.
The man's a monster.

670
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,912
I want nothing to do with him.

671
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:01,996
You're very much like
my granddaughter

672
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,993
who moans about the boy
she has her eye on.

673
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:09,955
Adolescents and women in their
eighth decade are strikingly similar.

674
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,633
You obviously require a battle plan.

675
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:19,032
My second husband, the General,

676
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:21,834
always advocated
attacking from the rear,

677
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,629
which, although it did nothing
to enhance our marriage,

678
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:28,035
did bring him some success
on the field.

679
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:32,316
Just slip in there, as it were,

680
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:34,511
and establish your beachhead.

681
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,036
Excuse us!
This is a private dressing room.

682
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:44,031
It's only me.

683
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:47,590
I'm sorry, but I did not want to be seen
in the theatre.

684
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:51,115
Oh, I have missed your company.

685
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:54,636
I thought I'd just drop by
to see if you needed anything.

686
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,512
Actually, if this may be our secret -

687
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:59,518
Mr um... Whatshisname
doesn't know I'm here.

688
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,398
We're fine, thank you, Mrs Henderson.

689
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,715
My poor dear, I'm having some cheese
sent up to you.

690
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,275
- Cheese?
- I'm not convinced you eat enough.

691
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,715
Yes, it's terribly sad.
She's just skin and bones.

692
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,196
Shut up! I weigh exactly what I weighed
the day I started this job, no less.

693
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,994
Something's wrong.
She won't eat chocolate truffles.

694
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,317
- She's so very, very head-girl.
- So sensible!

695
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:21,119
You see, it's unanimous.
You're positively scrawny!

696
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,191
You may laugh, but I know men.

697
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:25,794
Men look at bosoms, my dear,
but I notice bones.

698
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,439
What?

699
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:29,516
Spots!

700
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:31,119
No-one will notice.

701
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,958
Now, you must promise to let me know

702
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,912
if you have any complaints
or problems.

703
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,510
I mean, does Mr Van Damm treat...
Oh, my dear!

704
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:41,154
I wore a similar wig to a ball in Delhi.

705
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:43,999
Didn't look nearly as becoming
as it does on you.

706
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,519
Thank you, Mrs Henderson.

707
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,397
You remind me a bit of myself
at that time.

708
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,715
- Not too thin?
- Oh, you'd be surprised.

709
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,956
Now, remember not to tell anyone
I've been here.

710
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:53,957
Of course not. It's just between us girls.

711
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,913
- You all get on rather well, don't you?
- Yes, we're like a family.

712
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:59,116
There hasn't been
any improper behaviour?

713
00:52:59,240 --> 00:53:02,869
- From Mr Van Damm, that is.
- He's very good to us, Mrs Henderson.

714
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,628
He's like a father.
If fathers were nice.

715
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,836
- He treats us as what we are.
- And what is that?

716
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,473
Artists.

717
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:12,034
I have seemingly handed him
a kingdom.

718
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,958
Complete with harem.

719
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,720
Then, my dear,
you must infiltrate.

720
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,230
Like a delicious,
if overripe, Mata Hari.

721
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,637
Might I propose subterfuge?

722
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:28,671
Good afternoon.

723
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,920
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

724
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,037
Good afternoon.

725
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:38,432
Amazing. We get all kinds.

726
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:40,790
I have a very odd feeling, VD.

727
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:47,036
What I really need
is a rubber trumpet. Yes.

728
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,276
I've had an offer to join a rubber band!

729
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,356
Please don't do this!

730
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,391
Mrs Henderson, you are a fraud!

731
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,431
Oh. Oh!

732
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,674
Don't you dare manhandle me!

733
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:02,354
- Make a fool of yourself, if you must...
- Mr Van Damm!

734
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:04,988
...but not of me!
- No! Argh!

735
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,191
What on earth do you think
you were doing?

736
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:09,874
I simply want to make sure
you are doing your job properly.

737
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:12,873
It was most unpleasant of you
to grab my hairpiece.

738
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,520
That's made of authentic
Chinese hair!

739
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,636
Well, now you'll have some time

740
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,638
to calm down
and examine your behaviour.

741
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,798
My husband put me
on top of a cupboard once.

742
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:29,191
You have so much in common.

743
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:32,111
I'd like you to behave.

744
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,636
No doubt your husband said that to you
as well.

745
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,113
Oh, Mr Van Damm...

746
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:39,593
...I just can't help myself.

747
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,716
Well... cheerio, then.

748
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:46,037
No! Don't you dare leave me here!
No, don't you dare!

749
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:48,595
Don't you dare leave me!

750
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,752
This act's not half bad.

751
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:13,674
Thank you... very much.

752
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,909
You can't have an animal on stage
with naked women.

753
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,559
Yes, I see that.

754
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,113
It's a shame.

755
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,714
- I've got the new song.
Let's hear it.

756
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,671
Slower.

757
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,311
- What?
# The girl in the little green hat

758
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,351
You better see for yourself.

759
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:23,831
Hi, Mrs Henderson!

760
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:39,038
Try the river. It's Tuesday.

761
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,111
- Get me a taxi.
- Yes, VD.

762
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,715
- Tea?
- Yes, please. To take away.

763
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,910
We need a lot of caffeine.
We're exhausted.

764
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:51,110
You're exhausted?

765
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,708
All you girls do is just stand there.

766
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,358
And that, I am told,
is the definition of a star.

767
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,032
This has got to stop!

768
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:11,634
We're running a serious theatre.

769
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:13,950
The entire West End is laughing at us.

770
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,596
I haven't worked for years
to achieve a position of respect

771
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:19,671
Only to be perceived as a joke!

772
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:24,109
If all you want to be is a dilettante,
take your money and go someplace else!

773
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,476
I can't... hear you!

774
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,151
I'm not simply frivolous, you know.

775
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:37,033
And I don't ever, ever
want to be taken for granted.

776
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:41,112
Actually, I wished to ascertain
that artists who audition for us

777
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,350
are being treated
with the proper respect.

778
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,040
It turns out they are.
I am perfectly satisfied.

779
00:57:49,360 --> 00:57:53,433
On another matter entirely,
I was thinking about billing.

780
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,234
The programme says
"Mrs Henderson Presents Revudeville. "

781
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,709
It's absolutely charming,
but perhaps unfair.

782
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:02,389
Shouldn't it be
"Mrs Henderson Presents Revudeville -

783
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:04,750
a Vivian Van Damm production"?

784
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:06,999
I rather like that, don't you?

785
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:12,598
I'm going to have a joyride now.
Isn't that exciting?

786
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:26,430
I am not a servant!

787
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:29,711
You can't buy me off
with a piece of billing!

788
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,956
Do you hear? Bloody woman!

789
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,911
Is it well stocked with petrol?

790
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:53,717
What do you mean?

791
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:55,956
Do you think
we might make it to France?

792
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:45,751
I don't think I'll be back for a while.

793
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:13,554
Hitler invades France

794
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:56,191
- Mr Van Damm.
Mrs Henderson.

795
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:58,316
Welcome back.
- Thank you.

796
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:43,516
Do you mind if I sit here for a while?

797
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,551
Suit yourself.

798
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:05,037
I'm so sorry, Mr Van Damm.

799
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,431
I imagine...

800
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,111
...you have family.

801
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:19,919
Yes.

802
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:21,911
I can't bear feeling helpless.

803
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:25,109
I always think
there's something I can do.

804
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:31,637
But sometimes, of course...
there's nothing.

805
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:54,351
Champagne, madam?

806
01:03:57,160 --> 01:03:59,754
Attention!

807
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,271
Don't you feel a bit over-safe?

808
01:04:13,400 --> 01:04:15,311
Caution, my dear, caution.

809
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:20,190
You know, we're not certain what to do
about the theatres.

810
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,557
- Whatever do you mean?
- They're a frivolous distraction.

811
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,792
Exactly what young soldiers need.
Wouldn't you say?

812
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,839
There are other considerations.

813
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:37,713
Our intelligence tells us
the Luftwaffe will bomb London.

814
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,717
My dear, my intelligence tells me that.

815
01:04:39,840 --> 01:04:42,673
Then it will be dangerous
for people to congregate, won't it?

816
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,400
Oh, Tommy! Don't be silly!

817
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:47,793
Congregate underground?

818
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:50,150
Remember,
my theatre is beneath street level.

819
01:04:50,280 --> 01:04:52,111
It's the safest place to be.

820
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,834
Now, let's have no more
of these foolish ideas.

821
01:04:57,000 --> 01:04:58,911
Oh, Tommy!

822
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:14,397
Fires were started again last nlght
In the East End.

823
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:18,559
Londoners awoke after the tenth
consecutlve night of bombardment

824
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,677
by the German air force.

825
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:25,349
We have a huge challenge before us.

826
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:29,153
It's up to us, Revudeville,

827
01:07:29,320 --> 01:07:34,235
to fortify London in a way that
sandbags and anti-aircraft cannot do.

828
01:07:35,480 --> 01:07:37,755
They may bomb our city,

829
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,876
destroy our homes,

830
01:07:40,040 --> 01:07:41,553
kill our friends and neighbours,

831
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:45,229
but through it all,
our show will continue.

832
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,839
We will never stop performing,
and we will never close!

833
01:07:51,840 --> 01:07:55,230
He thinks
he's bloody Winston Churchill.

834
01:07:55,480 --> 01:07:57,914
Some of our family are going.

835
01:07:58,120 --> 01:07:59,838
Called up.

836
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:01,313
Yes.

837
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,995
Thank God our Bertie
has a heart murmur.

838
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:09,952
It may be wise for some of you
to move into the theatre.

839
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:14,358
We have room,
and because we're underground, we're safe.

840
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:18,957
Of course, we'll all have our war duties
as well as theatrical ones.

841
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:20,673
But...

842
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:25,112
we will pitch in and we will do our bit.

843
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:28,193
That was beautifully put,
Mr Van Damm.

844
01:08:28,360 --> 01:08:30,920
I'm sure we will all make
the necessary sacrifices.

845
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:35,349
Yesterday I wanted to buy a new hat.
I desisted.

846
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:38,028
I put the money
in National Savings instead.

847
01:08:40,040 --> 01:08:41,678
We shall come through.

848
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:35,557
Ken said you were up here.
I didn't believe him.

849
01:11:35,720 --> 01:11:36,948
Why ever not?

850
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:40,237
It's bloody dangerous, that's why!
Come on down.

851
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:42,118
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

852
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:44,757
The aircraft have passed.

853
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,996
Look, you can see them
over the East End.

854
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,788
You're ever so cautious,
Mr Van Damm.

855
01:11:52,160 --> 01:11:55,596
One shouldn't be overly so
at times like these.

856
01:11:55,800 --> 01:11:57,392
Everyone should be cautious.

857
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,909
You don't seem to take war
too seriously, Mrs Henderson.

858
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:16,637
I wonder what you were like
when you were young.

859
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,711
Rather dashing, I dare say.

860
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:21,511
And filled with hope.

861
01:12:23,320 --> 01:12:26,357
My mind turns towards young men
these days.

862
01:12:28,640 --> 01:12:29,993
You see, Mr Van Damm,

863
01:12:30,160 --> 01:12:34,199
I take war far more seriously
than you can ever dare imagine.

864
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:49,638
No, you'll have to cover her
faster than that.

865
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:53,588
- You need to be a lot faster.
- Those things weigh a ton, Bertie.

866
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,711
Goon. Take five minutes.

867
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,359
No, no, no... get it up.

868
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:02,999
I just can't lift it higher.

869
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,511
Oh, my dear, how generous.

870
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,515
- My goodness!
- Gin.

871
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,756
Help steel our nerves for the air raids.

872
01:14:15,880 --> 01:14:19,429
It does seem they're no longer bombing
during the tableaux.

873
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:22,632
Well, that's because Mr Van Damm
sent Hitler our programme.

874
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:25,360
Professional courtesy between Führers.

875
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:29,715
You're all so energetic and courageous.

876
01:14:31,160 --> 01:14:33,754
We're the only theatre
still playing in the West End.

877
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,798
Then you all go out with the soldiers
after the show. It's admirable.

878
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:39,713
Oh, but I don't. Well, I never go out.

879
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:41,791
My dear, why ever not?

880
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,599
Before I started stripping off
for a living, I was always falling in love.

881
01:14:48,280 --> 01:14:50,191
I was hopeless.

882
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:53,037
Never again.

883
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,037
So I've become a right little priss.

884
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,599
A naked spinster.

885
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,671
And that's the way I like it.

886
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:05,792
Who would have dreamed
that standing on a stage

887
01:15:05,960 --> 01:15:09,555
without any clothes on
would be the safest place to be?

888
01:15:57,120 --> 01:15:58,792
Could you er... come this way, sir?

889
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:02,550
Mrs Henderson
would like to speak to you.

890
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:13,113
Who's the flower for?

891
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:14,798
The girl inside the fan.

892
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:17,388
Speak up, dear.
- The girl in the fan.

893
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,551
Oh. Yes.

894
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,595
- How old are you?
- 21.

895
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:26,915
21?

896
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:30,149
Too young for her, I suppose.

897
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:32,231
Come back tomorrow night.

898
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:37,754
Sweet.

899
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,992
I was always afraid that someday
I'd end up working in a florist shop.

900
01:16:47,200 --> 01:16:49,430
- And now you are.
- I'm getting hay fever.

901
01:16:49,560 --> 01:16:50,879
And who is Paul?

902
01:16:51,040 --> 01:16:52,359
I have no idea.

903
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:54,436
Are you girls decent?

904
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:55,709
Oh, good.

905
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:57,711
I've brought someone.

906
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:00,149
This is Paul.

907
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,470
Oh. I see. Erm...

908
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:04,113
Girls, can you er...

909
01:17:17,520 --> 01:17:19,988
- I was... looking forward to...
- Speak up, dear.

910
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:22,236
Would you mind
if I had a moment alone?

911
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:24,271
Thank you.

912
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:29,554
- You've sent all these flowers.
- Don't be foolish, my dear.

913
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:32,837
I recognised the name of your florist.
He can't afford this sort of thing.

914
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:34,951
He comes from
a very distinguished family.

915
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,997
- Mrs Henderson!
- Well...

916
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:39,276
Truth is so prosaic.

917
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,470
He's young. That's all.

918
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:43,830
And rather well put together,
wouldn't you say?

919
01:17:43,960 --> 01:17:45,393
That face.

920
01:17:48,400 --> 01:17:50,118
He's young.

921
01:17:50,960 --> 01:17:52,951
And in five days he goes to the front.

922
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:55,831
And he may not come back.

923
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:58,269
- And it's so lonely out there in the...
- Trenches.

924
01:17:58,400 --> 01:18:00,470
Yes, I know the word.

925
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:02,875
Books have been written
about the last war,

926
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:05,031
and I have actually read some of them.

927
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:09,514
And I suppose he saw me on stage
and fell in love.

928
01:18:12,160 --> 01:18:15,789
Mrs Henderson,
one night my bicycle went off the road

929
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,952
and the next thing I knew,
I was an illusion.

930
01:18:19,160 --> 01:18:21,515
Because that's all we are up there.

931
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,831
But the odd thing is I'm still in
that river, and I want to be rescued.

932
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:28,919
But not by some drum roll
or applause or a soldier's fantasy.

933
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:31,836
Oh, dear,

934
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:34,633
you're such a tiresome generation.

935
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:36,995
You all want love.

936
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:40,436
We got along very nicely without it,
thank you very much.

937
01:18:40,600 --> 01:18:44,149
I don't see why that boy's fantasy
is any more foolish than yours.

938
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,511
Oh, damn.

939
01:18:54,760 --> 01:18:56,671
She loved your flowers, dear.

940
01:18:57,480 --> 01:18:59,391
What flowers?

941
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:45,471
Trouble, boss.

942
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:51,509
- Is it that bloody woman again?
- No, not this time, VD.

943
01:21:53,800 --> 01:21:55,392
Open up!

944
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,636
Do you want me to
knock the door down?

945
01:21:58,760 --> 01:22:00,239
You'll hurt your shoulder.

946
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,231
Get inside.

947
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,708
You can't do this.

948
01:22:05,800 --> 01:22:07,472
- Why not?
- You're part of our family.

949
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:08,959
A terrible choice of words.

950
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:11,713
- What are you talking about?
- I don't want to discuss it.

951
01:22:11,880 --> 01:22:14,553
But you have to tell me what's
behind this. You owe it to me.

952
01:22:14,680 --> 01:22:16,830
My concern for
the aesthetics of Revudeville.

953
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,552
What?

954
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:22,189
I don't think you want a nude on stage
who is pregnant!

955
01:22:22,480 --> 01:22:24,232
- Oh, Christ!
- 'Scuse me, Mr Van Damm.

956
01:22:24,320 --> 01:22:26,390
We were having
a private discussion.

957
01:22:26,520 --> 01:22:28,431
- We have a quick change.
- Yes.

958
01:22:35,880 --> 01:22:38,474
That was a particularly fine
programme, Mr Van Damm.

959
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,473
- I am pleased I recognised your talent.
- Go back into the theatre.

960
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:44,154
I do have a few notes
about the comedy routine.

961
01:22:44,320 --> 01:22:45,992
We don't have time for nonsense.
We have a crisis.

962
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:48,230
Why? Whatever's wrong?

963
01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,113
Maureen has just sent me
a letter of resignation.

964
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,918
Don't be ridiculous.
Why would she?

965
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:54,194
Because she's pregnant.

966
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:56,350
Two minutes, girls!

967
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:58,675
- Oh, my dear...
- I need some air.

968
01:22:58,880 --> 01:23:01,440
Look... You can work in the show
as a singer for the next few months.

969
01:23:01,560 --> 01:23:03,516
We'll keep you on salary,
until you...

970
01:23:03,640 --> 01:23:05,676
I can't think clearly. I need some air.

971
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,631
I'm so sorry. Was it?

972
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:09,751
Well, who else would it be?

973
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:11,989
He sent me a letter.

974
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:15,271
After he's demobbed,
he's going back to his girlfriend.

975
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:17,311
His girlfriend!
They all have girlfriends.

976
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,835
The crazy thing is, I fell for him.

977
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:24,396
Oh, it's not your fault. I'm a grown girl.
I knew what I was doing.

978
01:23:24,560 --> 01:23:26,039
But he had such a sweet face...

979
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:27,878
They all have sweet faces.

980
01:23:28,760 --> 01:23:31,354
You live in your own world,
Mrs Henderson.

981
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,953
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

982
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:36,235
I don't want to say something
I shouldn't.

983
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,396
I need some tea. And some air.

984
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,518
She said, "It's not your fault. "

985
01:23:40,640 --> 01:23:41,914
That can only mean one thing.

986
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,513
- Which is?
- That it Is your fault!

987
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,232
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

988
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:47,993
- Have you been giving advice?
- I don't like these questions.

989
01:23:48,160 --> 01:23:50,833
Excuse me, Mr Van Damm.
I want to take some air as well.

990
01:23:51,120 --> 01:23:53,236
You can't go out, Mrs Henderson.
The sirens went.

991
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:54,429
We didn't hear anything.

992
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,750
- A few minutes ago.
- Maureen's gone out.

993
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:58,199
- When?
- Just now.

994
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:00,350
Why didn't you stop her?

995
01:24:00,480 --> 01:24:01,629
Where's she going?

996
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,756
- For some air.
- No, to tea, she said.

997
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:14,757
You foolish, foolish woman.
Look what you've done.

998
01:25:15,560 --> 01:25:17,312
I thought, "Yes, well,

999
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:19,556
she's selfish and rude and eccentric,

1000
01:25:19,680 --> 01:25:22,353
but that goes with her class.
I can live with that. "

1001
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:23,833
I was a fool.

1002
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,916
You don't know anything
about the real world, do you?

1003
01:26:50,520 --> 01:26:53,114
It's not the same.

1004
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,197
The boys love it, boss.

1005
01:26:58,520 --> 01:26:59,999
I'm from the Lord Chamberlain's office.
This is for you.

1006
01:27:00,160 --> 01:27:02,549
We have to close your theatre.

1007
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:04,950
What?

1008
01:27:05,120 --> 01:27:08,317
It's causing too many people
to congregate in front of it.

1009
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,998
Telephone the newspapers.
Get them down here.

1010
01:27:14,200 --> 01:27:15,758
Yes, boss.

1011
01:27:15,880 --> 01:27:17,757
Maggie...

1012
01:27:18,880 --> 01:27:20,472
I know where to find her.

1013
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:22,989
Tell her to come to the theatre
immediately.

1014
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:31,839
Mrs Henderson would like to see
Lord Cromer as soon as possible.

1015
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:33,678
Here, at the theatre.

1016
01:27:33,800 --> 01:27:36,268
I don't think
the Lord Chamberlain is available...

1017
01:27:36,480 --> 01:27:39,313
Nonsense.
Mrs Henderson wishes to see him.

1018
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:41,988
Pray, pass the message.

1019
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,557
There's nothing I can do.
The theatre is closed.

1020
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:51,318
Manners, manners.
Clear a path, please.

1021
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:52,913
Please, clear a path.

1022
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:54,996
We need to see the girls.

1023
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:57,668
We ain't moving
until you open up the theatre.

1024
01:27:57,840 --> 01:27:59,592
- Open up!
- There's nothing I can do.

1025
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:01,950
I see the press are here, Van Damm.

1026
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:04,913
Yes.
I don't know how they got hold of it, sir.

1027
01:28:11,680 --> 01:28:14,035
- Good afternoon, Mrs Henderson.
- Maggie.

1028
01:28:17,040 --> 01:28:18,678
This way.

1029
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:24,956
There seems to be a nationwide desire
to keep this theatre open.

1030
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:26,952
Nationwide?

1031
01:28:27,120 --> 01:28:29,031
Please don't be delusional.

1032
01:28:29,200 --> 01:28:32,192
I have learnt in these many years
of dealing with artists

1033
01:28:32,400 --> 01:28:34,277
to detest imagination.

1034
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,558
Excuse me.

1035
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,119
Sorry.

1036
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:42,874
This street must be clear.

1037
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:46,112
It presents a very clear public danger.

1038
01:28:46,320 --> 01:28:48,788
I may have to ask the police
to interfere.

1039
01:28:48,960 --> 01:28:50,757
I'll talk to them.

1040
01:28:51,680 --> 01:28:53,238
What a commotion.

1041
01:28:53,360 --> 01:28:57,114
They think the theatre encourages
what they call overcongregating.

1042
01:28:57,320 --> 01:28:58,878
It seems that we're too popular.

1043
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,151
What, you mean we'd stay open
if we were a failure? How ridiculous!

1044
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:04,794
Listen, everybody.

1045
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,439
We have no choice.

1046
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,516
The government is forcing us to close.

1047
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:12,796
One more light...
dimming in the heart of London.

1048
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,638
He's turning into Winston again.

1049
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:16,432
What Herr Hitler

1050
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,278
was unable to do,

1051
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:21,437
Our own leaders
are determined to accomplish.

1052
01:29:22,360 --> 01:29:24,794
They are going to close the Windmill!

1053
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:26,029
Oh, really.

1054
01:29:26,200 --> 01:29:28,668
Excuse me, excuse me,
would you please let me through?

1055
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:30,398
Excuse me.

1056
01:29:30,520 --> 01:29:32,750
Excuse me.
Oh, that's so kind of you. Thank you.

1057
01:29:32,920 --> 01:29:35,195
Thank you.
Oh, that's most kind, thank you.

1058
01:29:35,360 --> 01:29:36,315
Thank you.

1059
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,197
Excuse me. Mr Van Damm.

1060
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:40,915
Hello, everybody.

1061
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:42,871
Um, may I intro... Oh, hello, Tom.

1062
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,752
May I introduce myself?

1063
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:46,393
I'm Mrs Henderson.

1064
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:49,830
You might see my name
on the billboard there.

1065
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,911
Well, I am that Mrs Henderson,

1066
01:29:52,040 --> 01:29:55,396
and I have presented the Windmill
for four years now.

1067
01:29:55,600 --> 01:29:57,830
Now, let me tell you why.

1068
01:29:58,000 --> 01:29:59,911
Oh, dear, are you able to see me?

1069
01:30:00,120 --> 01:30:01,712
No...

1070
01:30:02,680 --> 01:30:03,874
Here you are, ma'am.

1071
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:05,115
Oh, that's so sweet.

1072
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,032
- Are you American?
- Yes.

1073
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,039
Strange people, lovely manners.

1074
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,394
...there was a war before this one.

1075
01:30:12,760 --> 01:30:14,796
It was meant to end all wars.

1076
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:17,915
I lost my son in that war.

1077
01:30:19,160 --> 01:30:22,470
My only son. Alec.

1078
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,311
He was 21.

1079
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:29,790
He perished from poison gas,
I believe,

1080
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:31,911
On a field in France.

1081
01:30:35,720 --> 01:30:40,919
After - some time after - I went to
his room to clear away his things

1082
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,430
and I discovered
the most amazing thing.

1083
01:30:44,520 --> 01:30:47,114
What I believe you call
a French postcard.

1084
01:30:48,600 --> 01:30:50,238
A photograph of a naked woman.

1085
01:30:50,360 --> 01:30:52,271
He'd been hiding it.

1086
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:56,636
And I realised that Alec
had probably gone to his death

1087
01:30:56,840 --> 01:31:01,834
without ever seeing...
a woman naked in real life.

1088
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:07,519
Well, I thought
that was the most... awful thing.

1089
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:12,316
When you lose a son in a war,

1090
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:16,189
you do know,
no matter what anyone might say,

1091
01:31:16,400 --> 01:31:18,311
that his death has been in vain.

1092
01:31:20,720 --> 01:31:24,315
It won't stop others from following.
Other wars, other young men.

1093
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:27,873
Years later,
after my husband had died,

1094
01:31:28,120 --> 01:31:29,872
and I was on my own,
I decided to buy a theatre...

1095
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:31,274
and put on a nude revue,

1096
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:33,118
so that boys like Alec...

1097
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:36,429
...would never be
in the same predicament.

1098
01:31:38,120 --> 01:31:40,429
As long as the Windmill exists,

1099
01:31:41,400 --> 01:31:45,951
there's no need for a sad little postcard
stashed underneath a bed, is there?

1100
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:53,311
Sometimes... my feelings
towards our young men in uniform...

1101
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:58,111
...have led me to foolish actions,

1102
01:31:59,320 --> 01:32:01,390
which I do, in my very soul, regret.

1103
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,631
But I do know this:

1104
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:10,548
That my desire to present this gift to
our young men has not been wrong.

1105
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:16,958
If we are to ask our youth
to surrender their lives,

1106
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:21,239
then we should not ask them
to surrender joy,

1107
01:32:21,480 --> 01:32:23,357
Or the possibility of joy.

1108
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:26,836
And if, along the way,

1109
01:32:26,960 --> 01:32:30,236
we cause too many people
to congregate in the street,

1110
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:33,554
who gives a fiddler's fuck?

1111
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:40,550
There. I've said it.

1112
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,836
Oh, dear, another air raid.

1113
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:48,957
Don't you think everyone
would be so much safer inside?

1114
01:32:49,200 --> 01:32:50,394
Yes!

1115
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,397
Oh, for Christ's sake, Van Damm,

1116
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:55,512
take down that stupid sign
and let your public in.

1117
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:13,274
Closed

1118
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:16,952
We Never

1119
01:34:32,160 --> 01:34:34,628
I thought so.

1120
01:34:36,320 --> 01:34:38,436
You're going to ask me
to come down, aren't you?

1121
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:40,511
I wouldn't dream of it.

1122
01:34:43,560 --> 01:34:46,028
Now you know my secrets.

1123
01:34:46,480 --> 01:34:47,595
Yes.

1124
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,438
And I know none of yours.

1125
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,879
No.

1126
01:34:51,960 --> 01:34:53,518
Well...

1127
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,595
Actually, I think you do.

1128
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,951
We have made rather a goof it,
haven't we?

1129
01:35:02,120 --> 01:35:03,758
Yes.

1130
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:07,429
You're a very irritating woman but I
wouldn't have missed this for the world.

1131
01:35:07,680 --> 01:35:10,353
- I feel quite the same.
- Mm.

1132
01:35:10,960 --> 01:35:14,475
Even though you're
a very irritating man.

1133
01:35:17,480 --> 01:35:19,198
So, we'll continue?

1134
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,630
I'm game if you are.
- Oh Yes

1135
01:35:23,120 --> 01:35:26,317
It passes the time of day.

1136
01:35:29,520 --> 01:35:31,590
Let's watch the rest of the show.

1137
01:35:31,720 --> 01:35:33,039
You go inside.

1138
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:35,236
I'll stand here for a while.

1139
01:35:35,360 --> 01:35:37,271
As you wish.

1140
01:35:39,840 --> 01:35:41,432
Would you fancy a dance?

1141
01:35:41,680 --> 01:35:43,113
A dance? Where?

1142
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:44,955
Here.

1143
01:35:45,040 --> 01:35:46,792
Won't it be dangerous?

1144
01:35:46,920 --> 01:35:49,718
You're quite right.
I'm a very cautious man. But...

1145
01:35:49,880 --> 01:35:53,350
it won't be dangerous. Not Tonight

1146
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:54,709
Just one dance.

1147
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,875
- Mr Van Damm.
- Mrs Henderson.

1148
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,311
Ow! You've severed my toe.

1149
01:37:27,480 --> 01:37:29,835
- Nonsense. I didn't touch it.
- You're rather clumsy.

1150
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:32,235
That's not something
you say to a dancing partner.

1151
01:37:32,360 --> 01:37:34,749
You should take lessons
before issuing an invitation.

1152
01:37:34,920 --> 01:37:37,229
I'm a very good dancer,
thank you very much.

1153
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:48,950
In India only delicate men
are good dancers.

1154
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,111
The ungainly are not so.

1155
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,191
Listen, you old battleaxe...

1156
01:37:53,320 --> 01:37:55,231
Don't you dare speak to me like that.

1157
01:37:57,040 --> 01:38:01,636
Laura Henderson died in 1944. In Her will
she left Windmill Theatre to Vivian Van Damn.
