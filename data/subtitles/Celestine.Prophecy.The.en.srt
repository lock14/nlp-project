1
00:01:49,782 --> 00:01:51,782
Mr. Woodson! Take a shot.

2
00:01:52,076 --> 00:01:53,636
Oh, nice shot.

3
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:04,751
- Get up.
- Hey, over here!

4
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,807
- Mr. Woodson!
- Nice pass.

5
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,800
Hey, John.

6
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,649
Listen, the board met
this afternoon...

7
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,550
...and it's as bad as we thought.

8
00:02:33,995 --> 00:02:35,835
They're cutting back
the whole department.

9
00:02:36,081 --> 00:02:37,761
What, are you laying me off?

10
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,600
We knew this was coming. At this
point, it's just a leave of absence.

11
00:02:42,546 --> 00:02:44,946
With any luck, you'll be back
with us next fall.

12
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:47,766
You're laying me off.

13
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:54,770
- I'm sorry, John.
- That's okay.

14
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,920
Hey, hey. Michael Jordan was only
5'2" when he started.

15
00:03:17,249 --> 00:03:20,009
Of course, he was in kindergarten
and he could dunk the ball.

16
00:03:20,294 --> 00:03:22,694
Just keep practicing. All right?

17
00:04:31,702 --> 00:04:35,222
<i>- Hello?
- John? It's Charlene. </i>

18
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:40,019
Charlene? Wow, I was just
thinking about you the other day.

19
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:43,380
Listen, I'm so glad I was able
to reach you. I'm in town.

20
00:04:43,673 --> 00:04:46,073
I was hoping you might have
some time to get together.

21
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:49,385
Oh, yeah, I got a lot of time.

22
00:04:49,638 --> 00:04:52,678
Well, I'm staying at the Hilton,
near the airport.

23
00:04:52,974 --> 00:04:54,814
So, what did you wanna
talk to me about?

24
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:01,202
Last month I was in Peru
doing a piece on a relief project.

25
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,847
We went to this place called Viciente
and I met a priest there.

26
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:10,078
His name is Father Jose,
he's also an archaeologist.

27
00:05:10,451 --> 00:05:15,131
He told me about some scrolls that
he had discovered a few years ago.

28
00:05:16,124 --> 00:05:17,524
What kind of scrolls?

29
00:05:17,792 --> 00:05:21,512
Ancient writings.
No one knows who wrote them.

30
00:05:22,756 --> 00:05:24,196
It's a prophecy.

31
00:05:25,008 --> 00:05:27,368
Really? What does it predict?

32
00:05:27,636 --> 00:05:30,716
According to Father Jose,
it says that...

33
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:37,214
...all the conflict, the chaos
in this world, it's changing us.

34
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,639
And what does that mean?

35
00:05:39,857 --> 00:05:43,537
It means that the violence
is waking us up, in a way.

36
00:05:43,861 --> 00:05:48,901
The prophecy says that
we're going to discover something.

37
00:05:50,118 --> 00:05:51,318
Which is?

38
00:05:51,536 --> 00:05:53,136
He was vague about it...

39
00:05:53,371 --> 00:05:56,491
...but he said that it'll make us
look at everything differently.

40
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:04,052
I know this all sounds weird...

41
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:08,711
...but if you'll just listen...

42
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:12,254
Okay. Okay. I'll listen.

43
00:06:12,558 --> 00:06:15,358
So when is this revelation
supposed to happen?

44
00:06:15,644 --> 00:06:18,724
The prophecy says it'll begin during
the first years of this century.

45
00:06:19,023 --> 00:06:20,863
Well, that's now.

46
00:06:21,734 --> 00:06:23,734
Yeah, I know.

47
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:30,364
Excuse me, sir. Can I
please get my luggage?

48
00:06:30,618 --> 00:06:32,538
Certainly. Will you be needing
a taxi today?

49
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:35,869
- Yes, please.
- The baggage will be out by the cab.

50
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,808
Great. It's just one bag.

51
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:47,871
Have you ever wondered why
we don't spend more time together?

52
00:06:48,512 --> 00:06:50,592
How long have I known you,
five or six years?

53
00:06:50,848 --> 00:06:52,368
About that long, yeah.

54
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,720
How many relationships
have you had?

55
00:06:57,397 --> 00:07:00,397
You get involved with somebody
because it makes you feel good...

56
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:04,133
...but it never works out
because you're not really there.

57
00:07:04,446 --> 00:07:07,206
Whatever happened to that
big theory you were trying to find?

58
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:09,770
Inspire all those kids.
What happened to that?

59
00:07:10,076 --> 00:07:12,596
I found out it isn't that easy.

60
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:17,108
You should go to Viciente, John.

61
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:21,271
They're studying this prophecy
down there. I can't explain it...

62
00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:25,189
...but the people there are different.
This place is different.

63
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:27,831
Why are you calling me
about all this now?

64
00:07:28,095 --> 00:07:32,375
Because every time I would think of
this prophecy, I would think of you.

65
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:34,725
Then I found out that
I had a stopover here.

66
00:07:35,728 --> 00:07:38,568
Maybe you're hearing this
at the right time.

67
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,833
Hey, Meredith.

68
00:08:00,254 --> 00:08:03,014
Whatcha say, darling?
How are you?

69
00:08:08,429 --> 00:08:12,389
Have a good day, girl?
Better than mine, I hope.

70
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,671
<i>You should go to Viciente, John.
The people there are different. </i>

71
00:09:17,001 --> 00:09:19,841
<i>This place is different.</i>

72
00:09:20,755 --> 00:09:23,675
Travel agency...

73
00:09:40,359 --> 00:09:44,519
Cancellation? When's it leaving?
Tomorrow?

74
00:09:44,864 --> 00:09:48,064
Yeah, I'll take it. All right, thanks.

75
00:09:51,663 --> 00:09:53,663
Wanna go to Peru?

76
00:09:57,252 --> 00:10:00,852
<i>I haven't been in Lima in quite a while.
How long have you lived there?</i>

77
00:10:01,173 --> 00:10:03,573
Oh, I'm new to Peru.
I've lived in Bolivia...

78
00:10:03,842 --> 00:10:06,522
...for the last 10 years, so I haven't
met your Father Jose.

79
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:09,942
In any case, the local priests are
so numerous, aren't they?

80
00:10:10,766 --> 00:10:12,486
I suppose they are.

81
00:10:12,726 --> 00:10:16,246
Excuse me. I just heard you
mention a Father Jose?

82
00:10:17,898 --> 00:10:20,138
A friend of mine
just told me about him.

83
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:23,303
Dobson. Dr. Sidney Dobson.

84
00:10:23,863 --> 00:10:26,983
Would you like a drink?
Two more Scotches, please.

85
00:10:27,283 --> 00:10:29,163
Sure, right away.

86
00:10:29,953 --> 00:10:34,313
- So are you a scientist?
- Oh, no. John Woodson, tourist.

87
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,946
But I'm going to Peru because I'm
interested in this place called Viciente.

88
00:10:38,253 --> 00:10:39,693
Yes.

89
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:46,866
I met Jose in Boston
at an anthropological meeting.

90
00:10:47,221 --> 00:10:49,461
I kept in touch over the years.

91
00:10:49,723 --> 00:10:53,923
I had no idea what he had found until
several weeks ago. He called me...

92
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:57,590
...and asked me to help affirm
the prophecy's authenticity.

93
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:02,700
He sent me copies of the first two
scrolls along with translations.

94
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,279
Real thing.
There's no doubt about it.

95
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:10,734
Written no later than 5 or 6 B.C.
But you know the curious thing?

96
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:12,719
They were found in a wooden box...

97
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:16,794
<i>... which dates to
only about 1600 A.D. </i>

98
00:11:17,127 --> 00:11:19,607
<i>Someone in the early Church
had buried them. </i>

99
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,120
Early Church? Franciscan or Jesuit?

100
00:11:24,844 --> 00:11:27,044
Oh, I'm a history teacher.

101
00:11:27,304 --> 00:11:31,144
Well, apparently Franciscan. Although
they seem to be inspired by a pope.

102
00:11:32,643 --> 00:11:35,123
Celestine V, I think.

103
00:11:36,481 --> 00:11:39,721
You mentioned that you had copies of
them. Can you tell me what they say?

104
00:11:40,026 --> 00:11:41,466
No, not really.

105
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:45,295
They talk about a shift in human
understanding, I don't know.

106
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:48,375
But, you know, the curious thing,
the most astonishing thing...

107
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,180
...is the description
of the modern era.

108
00:11:51,455 --> 00:11:56,255
Our problems, our technologies.
I mean, it is utterly amazing.

109
00:11:56,794 --> 00:11:57,754
Think about it.

110
00:11:58,003 --> 00:12:02,323
A document this old, speaking
in such detail about our time?

111
00:12:03,217 --> 00:12:05,057
Think about it.

112
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,760
It was a pleasure
traveling with you.

113
00:12:20,026 --> 00:12:23,346
- You staying in town?
- Delgado.

114
00:12:23,697 --> 00:12:25,537
I'm just down the street
at the Hacienda.

115
00:12:25,782 --> 00:12:28,902
Father Jose's church is just down
the street from there.

116
00:12:29,453 --> 00:12:31,893
Why don't you come see him
with me in the morning?

117
00:12:32,164 --> 00:12:33,484
He has the original scrolls.

118
00:12:33,707 --> 00:12:37,027
He wants to make them public
as soon as possible.

119
00:12:37,336 --> 00:12:39,736
- Why's that?
- I don't know.

120
00:12:40,047 --> 00:12:42,767
You can ask him yourself
in the morning.

121
00:12:52,936 --> 00:12:55,336
You see someone
down there you know?

122
00:12:56,898 --> 00:12:59,458
Oh, no. No, not really.

123
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,459
Pretty girl.

124
00:14:45,053 --> 00:14:46,933
Saint Francis was a great man.

125
00:14:47,222 --> 00:14:49,622
He could see beauty
where others couldn't.

126
00:14:50,935 --> 00:14:53,375
- I'm sorry, I was just taking a walk.
- It's all right.

127
00:14:53,646 --> 00:14:57,566
American? Now, what has
brought you to Peru?

128
00:14:59,444 --> 00:15:01,404
You're Father Jose, aren't you?

129
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:04,139
I'm John Woodson.

130
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:07,285
A friend of mine, Charlene Benet,
met you a few weeks ago.

131
00:15:07,577 --> 00:15:09,857
And she told you
about our prophecy.

132
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,770
John, listen to me. I know you.

133
00:15:16,044 --> 00:15:18,124
You're here to do
something important.

134
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,940
<i>But you need to leave quickly.</i>

135
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:22,417
- What are you talking about?
- Go!

136
00:15:24,386 --> 00:15:25,866
I will try to help you.

137
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:42,268
You have caused us
a lot of trouble, old man.

138
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:48,195
It was in a hidden compartment
in the wall of the sacristy.

139
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:52,590
You should have
hidden them better, Padre.

140
00:15:55,252 --> 00:15:57,012
Eight scrolls.

141
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:03,521
Where's the ninth?

142
00:16:07,223 --> 00:16:08,863
Okay.

143
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,100
One way or another,
I'm going to put an end to all of this.

144
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:16,558
You're going to try.
You will do everything you can.

145
00:16:16,858 --> 00:16:19,178
But it's already too late.

146
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:28,623
You are very calm
for a man about to die.

147
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:32,994
Everybody dies. Even you, senor.

148
00:16:43,344 --> 00:16:46,624
John! Wait. Slow down a minute.

149
00:16:46,931 --> 00:16:48,611
Why didn't you just call the police?

150
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,010
I'm not sure what's going on.
It could be nothing.

151
00:16:51,269 --> 00:16:55,229
Nothing? You got me out of bed in the
middle of the night for nothing?

152
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:12,217
Don't do that.
You'll never get rid of her.

153
00:17:15,294 --> 00:17:18,574
What the...? John!

154
00:18:26,494 --> 00:18:28,094
Need some help?

155
00:18:39,424 --> 00:18:41,384
They seem to have left.

156
00:18:44,263 --> 00:18:47,743
We were going to that church a block
away, looking for the priest.

157
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:50,946
Father Jose?

158
00:18:52,313 --> 00:18:54,953
- Yeah.
- And who is "we"?

159
00:18:55,775 --> 00:19:00,055
This professor, I met him on a plane.
He's looking for some artifact.

160
00:19:00,446 --> 00:19:02,206
The prophecy.

161
00:19:05,201 --> 00:19:06,761
Go on.

162
00:19:07,036 --> 00:19:08,596
Wait a minute.

163
00:19:09,289 --> 00:19:10,889
You know about all this?

164
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,191
Who are you?

165
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:17,258
Part of your story, apparently.
My name is Wil.

166
00:19:17,881 --> 00:19:20,521
- John.
- I'm a guide.

167
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:26,459
I was working with Jose
when he found the scrolls.

168
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,740
That's him, yeah.

169
00:19:31,103 --> 00:19:34,663
- Who's this woman?
- Julia Sims. She's a friend, a linguist.

170
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:37,462
- Translated most of the prophecy.
- And him?

171
00:19:37,735 --> 00:19:39,135
His name is Father Sanchez.

172
00:19:39,362 --> 00:19:42,122
He lives in the mountains
with the local Indians.

173
00:19:42,407 --> 00:19:44,087
Philosopher, you could say.

174
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,320
I have a feeling you'll meet him.

175
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:54,623
Now, what about your friend, the
professor? Tell me what happened.

176
00:19:55,003 --> 00:19:58,643
They took him, right in front of me.
That's why I was running.

177
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:01,885
I think they got Father Jose too.

178
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,870
Put this on.

179
00:20:09,685 --> 00:20:11,445
We have to leave.

180
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:18,385
You think it'd be safe
to go back to the hotel?

181
00:20:24,117 --> 00:20:26,157
- I don't think so.
- Maybe you could take me...

182
00:20:26,411 --> 00:20:28,051
...to the American Embassy.

183
00:20:32,918 --> 00:20:34,718
Too risky.

184
00:20:44,388 --> 00:20:47,028
General.
His Excellency Cardinal Sebastian.

185
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,600
Such a surprise
to have you visit me.

186
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:57,482
You've arrested an American.

187
00:20:57,736 --> 00:20:59,176
A professor.

188
00:20:59,738 --> 00:21:03,098
On his way to meet with
your Father Jose.

189
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:05,453
Cigar?

190
00:21:07,538 --> 00:21:10,458
Don't you realize this will only bring
more publicity?

191
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,154
You should have consulted me.

192
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:18,202
Permit me to remind you,
Your Excellency.

193
00:21:19,092 --> 00:21:22,012
It was you who informed me
of the dangers of the prophecy.

194
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:25,792
And it was you who sought my help.

195
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:28,919
I said the document was heretical.

196
00:21:29,686 --> 00:21:31,566
That it needed to be contained.

197
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:34,173
I didn't say create an incident
with the Americans.

198
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:36,381
There will be an investigation.

199
00:21:37,444 --> 00:21:39,204
This country is a democracy now.

200
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:43,528
This prophecy
is creating instability...

201
00:21:43,784 --> 00:21:46,144
...at a time
when we're already threatened...

202
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:51,019
...by insurrection. Besides, you must
understand that there are other...

203
00:21:51,584 --> 00:21:58,024
...interests involved in this matter now.
This prophecy must be dealt with.

204
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,740
Other interests.

205
00:22:02,554 --> 00:22:05,314
Father Jose, he was not present
at Mass this morning.

206
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:07,351
No one can find him.

207
00:22:09,144 --> 00:22:12,744
People go missing every day
in Peru.

208
00:22:13,982 --> 00:22:17,982
If you want,
I'll have someone look into it.

209
00:22:19,113 --> 00:22:21,513
The scrolls are Church property.

210
00:22:22,825 --> 00:22:24,985
They must be returned to me.

211
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:46,731
It's all I can bear,
to tolerate his arrogance.

212
00:22:47,184 --> 00:22:50,664
In a moment, he can remove
anyone from the Church.

213
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:53,100
Damn them forever.

214
00:22:54,108 --> 00:22:57,828
We might control
the people's minds...

215
00:22:58,154 --> 00:23:00,714
...but he controls their souls.

216
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:04,550
He can be used.
That's all that interests me.

217
00:23:04,869 --> 00:23:06,749
This is all a waste of my time.

218
00:23:06,996 --> 00:23:10,076
This prophecy, it's nothing.

219
00:23:10,375 --> 00:23:12,935
Why do you fear it so?

220
00:23:16,757 --> 00:23:19,877
Because, general,
in the world it predicts...

221
00:23:20,177 --> 00:23:23,217
...there's no need for people
like you and me.

222
00:23:30,646 --> 00:23:33,446
Do your part and
you'll get what you want.

223
00:23:37,028 --> 00:23:39,428
Do you have the pictures
of the other American?

224
00:23:44,035 --> 00:23:46,635
General, what about
Professor Dobson?

225
00:23:47,038 --> 00:23:51,238
Call the American Embassy.
Tell them his detention was a mistake.

226
00:23:51,918 --> 00:23:56,318
Then take him to the airport.
I think he'll be ready to go home.

227
00:24:02,012 --> 00:24:05,012
Now, who are you?

228
00:24:05,307 --> 00:24:08,707
And what are you doing
in my country?

229
00:24:15,026 --> 00:24:18,306
I called the embassy.
Dobson's okay.

230
00:24:19,489 --> 00:24:23,049
They're saying it was a case of
mistaken identity.

231
00:24:23,368 --> 00:24:25,168
He's already headed back to
the States.

232
00:24:25,412 --> 00:24:27,132
What about Father Jose?

233
00:24:27,956 --> 00:24:29,996
No one has seen him.

234
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,810
I think someone is trying to
suppress the prophecy.

235
00:24:34,129 --> 00:24:36,649
Who'd do that, Wil? Why?

236
00:24:36,924 --> 00:24:38,724
Certain people in the government,
probably.

237
00:24:39,844 --> 00:24:41,364
They view it as a threat.

238
00:24:41,596 --> 00:24:45,316
It's not, of course,
but they don't see that.

239
00:24:45,641 --> 00:24:47,321
Maybe I should try to get home too.

240
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,920
If they let Dobson go,
maybe it's safe for me to leave.

241
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,196
Or maybe you should come with me.

242
00:24:56,486 --> 00:25:00,086
Do you suppose it was an accident
that you came to Peru...

243
00:25:00,407 --> 00:25:02,167
...that you met Dobson?

244
00:25:03,452 --> 00:25:06,932
How did you end up taking
that particular flight?

245
00:25:07,247 --> 00:25:08,927
Think about it.

246
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:12,263
Why did I see you from my window
when I did?

247
00:25:12,837 --> 00:25:13,837
You're gonna love this.

248
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:16,766
I was all set to get out of there,
I was packed, I was ready...

249
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,609
...and then I had this strange feeling
I'd forgotten something.

250
00:25:22,221 --> 00:25:23,861
That's when you showed up.

251
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:31,469
Are you telling me
this is some kind of a fate thing?

252
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:34,411
That I'm supposed to go with you?
For what?

253
00:25:36,069 --> 00:25:39,549
There's part of the prophecy
that still has to be found.

254
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:45,898
One more scroll. The ninth.

255
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:50,064
No, no, no. Forget about it.

256
00:25:50,293 --> 00:25:52,133
I don't even know if
I believe this stuff.

257
00:25:52,378 --> 00:25:56,538
All I had in mind was to come to Peru
and find Viciente. That's it.

258
00:25:57,884 --> 00:25:59,564
Where you headed to, anyway?

259
00:26:00,094 --> 00:26:01,534
Viciente.

260
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:30,771
Viciente, what's it like?

261
00:26:31,044 --> 00:26:34,404
It's an old ranch, about 1000 acres.

262
00:26:34,756 --> 00:26:36,796
Been in the owner's family
for hundreds of years.

263
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:40,010
It goes all the way back to
the Spanish land grants.

264
00:26:40,303 --> 00:26:41,903
The Moors.

265
00:26:42,973 --> 00:26:45,453
These days, it's a kind of retreat.

266
00:26:47,436 --> 00:26:49,636
And the people there,
they're studying the prophecy?

267
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:51,417
Some of them.

268
00:26:51,649 --> 00:26:52,929
Tell me about it.

269
00:26:54,026 --> 00:26:56,986
So far,
we've discovered eight scrolls.

270
00:26:58,197 --> 00:27:00,797
Each one contains a certain truth
about our existence.

271
00:27:01,075 --> 00:27:02,995
We call them insights.

272
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:07,646
Insights, the prophecy says,
we've all gotta understand.

273
00:27:09,459 --> 00:27:13,419
Look, I could describe these insights
to you right now...

274
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:15,877
...and you would hear my words...

275
00:27:17,217 --> 00:27:19,337
...but you have to do more than that.

276
00:27:21,263 --> 00:27:23,583
You have to experience it
for yourself.

277
00:27:23,849 --> 00:27:26,609
The prophecy has to happen to you.

278
00:27:31,315 --> 00:27:33,595
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

279
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:39,027
I'm talking about
seeing the world, John.

280
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:41,363
The way it really is.

281
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:04,168
You get the first insight
when you realize...

282
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:06,875
...there's a mystery
operating out there...

283
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:09,984
...moving us somewhere,
for a reason.

284
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:14,439
It's there for everyone,
but only a few notice.

285
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,435
You're talking about
these weird coincidences?

286
00:28:18,698 --> 00:28:22,738
Once you begin to really look,
you start seeing them more and more.

287
00:28:23,578 --> 00:28:26,578
Well, if it's true they have meaning,
that would be incredible.

288
00:28:26,873 --> 00:28:30,073
I mean, I know history.
That would change everything.

289
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:34,617
That's the second insight,
that the world is about to change.

290
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:38,170
What about the others?

291
00:28:40,429 --> 00:28:44,989
In time,
you'll open up your perception...

292
00:28:45,351 --> 00:28:46,871
...find your guidance.

293
00:28:47,103 --> 00:28:50,343
You'll discover
why you're really here.

294
00:28:52,775 --> 00:28:54,615
What about
the missing ninth scroll?

295
00:28:54,861 --> 00:28:57,181
I believe it puts the others
into perspective.

296
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,280
Shows us where it's all leading.

297
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:06,949
And what makes you think
you can ever find it?

298
00:29:10,336 --> 00:29:12,776
Because that's why I'm here.

299
00:29:38,115 --> 00:29:40,475
Dream anything last night?

300
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:46,487
Yeah. Little girl
I dreamed about before.

301
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:48,510
It makes no sense.

302
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:50,071
It's probably important.

303
00:29:51,796 --> 00:29:53,076
Why would you say that?

304
00:29:53,297 --> 00:29:55,657
Because regardless of
how confusing they are...

305
00:29:55,925 --> 00:29:58,245
...dreams are always trying to
tell us something.

306
00:29:59,804 --> 00:30:01,844
Maybe you just need
a larger perspective.

307
00:30:11,984 --> 00:30:14,144
My God.

308
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:17,274
What is this place?

309
00:30:17,531 --> 00:30:19,491
Celestine ruins.

310
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:22,729
They found the
first eight scrolls there.

311
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,675
- Maybe the ninth is there too.
- Maybe.

312
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,877
What's that over there?

313
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:32,487
The mission. Cardinal Sebastian
had it rebuilt 10 years ago.

314
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:34,439
He's the head of the Church here.

315
00:30:34,674 --> 00:30:36,914
Viciente, where's that?

316
00:30:38,178 --> 00:30:40,018
In a hurry?

317
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,260
Rebels.

318
00:31:01,494 --> 00:31:03,294
It's been going on for a while here.

319
00:31:03,788 --> 00:31:05,748
They're trying to
overthrow the government?

320
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,120
These things are always about
power struggle.

321
00:31:09,752 --> 00:31:12,912
- They're really well supplied.
- Yeah.

322
00:31:16,134 --> 00:31:17,934
Let's move.

323
00:31:49,377 --> 00:31:50,817
Miguel.

324
00:31:51,797 --> 00:31:55,597
Wil. I had a feeling you'd show up.

325
00:31:59,471 --> 00:32:01,431
Good to see you.

326
00:32:04,268 --> 00:32:06,388
It's good to see you, my friend.

327
00:32:06,645 --> 00:32:09,725
Julia's already arrived
and Father Sanchez is on his way.

328
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:11,504
I knew it.

329
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:14,156
You think it's time, don't you?

330
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:16,982
Yeah. I do.

331
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,800
John.

332
00:32:21,286 --> 00:32:23,886
Meet my friend, Miguel.
We are his guests here.

333
00:32:25,207 --> 00:32:28,967
Hi. It's a beautiful place.
Heck of a time getting here.

334
00:32:29,294 --> 00:32:33,214
Yeah. We like to consider it
our little oasis.

335
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,440
Well, look what the wind blew in.

336
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,520
Julia. Julia.

337
00:32:40,806 --> 00:32:43,526
I saw your truck come in.

338
00:32:44,644 --> 00:32:46,484
I'm so glad you're here.

339
00:32:46,729 --> 00:32:48,889
Did you drive straight through?

340
00:32:49,148 --> 00:32:50,548
- Meet John.
- Hi.

341
00:32:50,775 --> 00:32:52,055
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

342
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,210
We've been working on the
translations and we found something.

343
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:01,097
It seems to be saying that
the ninth isn't on a scroll at all.

344
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:03,971
It's going to just appear.

345
00:33:05,207 --> 00:33:06,767
Appear?

346
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,840
Could be there's something
we have to do.

347
00:33:09,086 --> 00:33:11,406
Something to make it happen.

348
00:33:13,007 --> 00:33:14,567
That was some ride.

349
00:33:15,551 --> 00:33:16,871
He's involved somehow.

350
00:33:17,094 --> 00:33:19,254
Maybe you should talk to him.

351
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:51,372
It's beautiful, isn't it?

352
00:33:56,427 --> 00:33:57,667
Come walk with me.

353
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:25,974
What's going on here?
What are they doing?

354
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:30,290
Let's just say they're
giving the garden their attention.

355
00:34:35,051 --> 00:34:38,011
How much do you know about
the prophecy?

356
00:34:38,304 --> 00:34:40,304
Not that much, not yet.

357
00:34:43,101 --> 00:34:45,301
Have you been having dreams?

358
00:34:45,812 --> 00:34:49,452
Something brought you here, right?
Synchronicity?

359
00:34:49,775 --> 00:34:51,695
Yeah, how'd you know that?

360
00:34:52,444 --> 00:34:54,844
Because that's how it begins
for everyone.

361
00:34:55,114 --> 00:34:57,834
Wil told me I had to open up,
whatever that means.

362
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,400
And you think that's strange?

363
00:35:01,662 --> 00:35:05,582
Well, I have no idea what
he's talking about with that. Seriously.

364
00:35:06,167 --> 00:35:08,847
There's much more to the world
than you think, John.

365
00:35:10,088 --> 00:35:11,568
A beauty...

366
00:35:12,465 --> 00:35:14,345
...and energy.

367
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:25,062
You talk about strange,
I know that woman.

368
00:35:25,646 --> 00:35:26,966
I saw her at the airport.

369
00:35:27,189 --> 00:35:30,389
Go talk to her, if you'd like. I'll wait.

370
00:35:33,863 --> 00:35:36,343
Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing you.

371
00:35:36,657 --> 00:35:39,537
I'm John Woodson.
Julia's showing me around.

372
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,080
Marjorie Carter.

373
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:54,022
Some place here, huh? I hear it goes
all the way back to colonial times.

374
00:35:54,342 --> 00:35:59,302
Yeah. Yeah, no, it's one of the most
incredible spots I have ever seen.

375
00:36:07,523 --> 00:36:09,323
I suppose you're staying here
at the house?

376
00:36:09,608 --> 00:36:10,968
We should get together later.

377
00:36:11,193 --> 00:36:13,073
Talk some more about all this stuff.

378
00:36:14,155 --> 00:36:15,955
Not this time.

379
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,800
Come on, you should do this.
It'll be fun.

380
00:36:24,207 --> 00:36:27,287
You can tell me all about
what's happening here.

381
00:36:27,586 --> 00:36:29,346
I'm interested in everything.

382
00:36:30,047 --> 00:36:33,927
I've got a lot of work to get through.
I'm gonna get to it.

383
00:36:34,676 --> 00:36:36,196
Nice to meet you.

384
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,190
What was that?

385
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,670
Didn't work out too well, huh?

386
00:36:42,893 --> 00:36:45,293
That's the understatement
of the year.

387
00:36:45,563 --> 00:36:47,123
What did I say?

388
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:49,758
It's not what you said,
it's what you did.

389
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:53,243
Your energy made her feel as though
you wanted to control her.

390
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:54,969
She felt dominated.

391
00:36:55,198 --> 00:36:58,438
Oh, come on. I wasn't doing that.

392
00:36:58,743 --> 00:37:01,623
Really? You weren't trying to
coax her into something?

393
00:37:01,913 --> 00:37:03,433
- No.
- Manipulate her?

394
00:37:03,665 --> 00:37:05,625
She isn't used to that around here.

395
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:08,276
That's completely nuts.
Where are you getting this stuff?

396
00:37:08,587 --> 00:37:10,227
I could see it.

397
00:37:11,882 --> 00:37:14,402
Remember the halos
the old masters used to paint...

398
00:37:14,677 --> 00:37:16,957
...around their religious figures?

399
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:20,910
You think they made those up,
or were they seeing something real?

400
00:37:22,059 --> 00:37:24,979
It's the energy, John.
It reveals what we do to each other.

401
00:37:25,271 --> 00:37:28,831
You may not be conscious of it,
but you were taking her energy.

402
00:37:30,276 --> 00:37:32,036
I could see it.

403
00:37:33,196 --> 00:37:34,396
So could she.

404
00:37:44,792 --> 00:37:47,032
How did the afternoon go?

405
00:37:48,546 --> 00:37:50,386
I spoke to Julia.

406
00:37:50,631 --> 00:37:52,351
So I heard.

407
00:37:52,591 --> 00:37:54,231
<i>I got lots of questions.</i>

408
00:37:54,468 --> 00:37:56,388
This stuff never ends, does it?

409
00:37:57,388 --> 00:38:01,148
It's all gonna make sense,
eventually.

410
00:38:03,186 --> 00:38:06,266
Everyone you meet here is
gonna show you something.

411
00:38:12,904 --> 00:38:14,904
John and Wil. Please, join us.

412
00:38:15,157 --> 00:38:17,637
We've got great people, great food.

413
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:19,990
Everything is fresh from the garden.

414
00:38:25,918 --> 00:38:27,198
Miguel?

415
00:38:28,629 --> 00:38:31,309
Who's that man over there,
on the other side of the table?

416
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:33,791
Jensen. He's an archaeologist.

417
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:36,612
He's here on sabbatical.
A friend of a friend.

418
00:38:36,888 --> 00:38:40,408
- Would you like me to introduce you?
- No, no, no. Never mind.

419
00:38:57,326 --> 00:39:00,166
- I knew I'd find you here.
- Waiting for you.

420
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:03,933
You seem happy.

421
00:39:04,208 --> 00:39:06,728
I am. Really good.

422
00:39:07,003 --> 00:39:09,723
I'm celebrating my fourth with Tom.

423
00:39:11,674 --> 00:39:16,554
Oh, come on, Wil.
You never had time for us anyway.

424
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:20,850
True. But I'm glad for you and Tom.

425
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:24,624
And you and I will always
be connected.

426
00:39:26,106 --> 00:39:27,346
University of Miami.

427
00:39:28,317 --> 00:39:30,637
Your Hurricanes crushed
my Bulldogs last year.

428
00:39:30,903 --> 00:39:31,983
I'm still not over it.

429
00:39:32,196 --> 00:39:35,316
Yeah. You got me.

430
00:39:35,616 --> 00:39:37,656
I teach there with Julia.

431
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:40,910
I've been helping her with the
translations for about a year now.

432
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:44,285
In fact, I was on my way back
when you saw me.

433
00:39:44,584 --> 00:39:46,624
That mean something,
that I saw you?

434
00:39:46,878 --> 00:39:50,678
Maybe. Maybe that we have
something to talk about, actually.

435
00:39:51,007 --> 00:39:52,447
If you believe the prophecy.

436
00:39:56,513 --> 00:39:58,633
You were thinking
about a child last time.

437
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,810
You were going to adopt.

438
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,429
It's not that easy.

439
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:07,168
We've met a few children...

440
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,880
...but I guess it has to be
the right one.

441
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:15,039
It'll happen for you.

442
00:40:20,121 --> 00:40:23,001
Listen, I've been thinking about
Father Jose.

443
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:26,658
He was too public about it.
I tried to tell him.

444
00:40:26,962 --> 00:40:28,522
Others have to know, Wil.

445
00:40:28,797 --> 00:40:31,437
They have to know about
the prophecy.

446
00:40:31,717 --> 00:40:33,397
Your friend John, for one.

447
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:35,491
Yeah.

448
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:40,694
What do you think of him?

449
00:40:41,143 --> 00:40:42,543
I think he'll get there.

450
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,660
Unless, of course,
he gets too distracted.

451
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:50,182
Julia told me that
you could see things happening...

452
00:40:50,445 --> 00:40:51,925
...when we talked in the garden.

453
00:40:52,155 --> 00:40:54,355
I glimpsed it, I guess.

454
00:40:54,616 --> 00:40:58,456
But to be honest,
I felt it more than anything.

455
00:40:59,579 --> 00:41:01,939
There's just something
so familiar about you, I can't...

456
00:41:02,207 --> 00:41:04,727
John, this player thing you do
really gets in your way.

457
00:41:05,001 --> 00:41:07,521
I'm not playing. Didn't you say
we were supposed to talk?

458
00:41:07,796 --> 00:41:10,916
God, it's amazing how easy it is to
lose yourself around some people.

459
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:12,776
Why, are you losing yourself?

460
00:41:14,678 --> 00:41:15,958
I'm talking about you.

461
00:41:24,689 --> 00:41:26,489
Good night.

462
00:41:35,992 --> 00:41:38,752
We're going to do something
about Viciente.

463
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:45,003
We intend to rid this country of
everyone involved with the prophecy.

464
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,712
The opportunity is at hand...

465
00:41:48,964 --> 00:41:51,844
...to destroy all
the remaining translations.

466
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:54,214
Who are you working for?

467
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,821
You don't want to know.

468
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:59,346
Just think of them as
powerful people...

469
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,560
...who, like you,
have their own agenda.

470
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:04,935
They are making many
investments here in Peru...

471
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,125
...and they demand stability.

472
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:10,671
We must cooperate.

473
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:17,405
They wouldn't be helping you with...

474
00:42:17,911 --> 00:42:19,991
...your own political ambitions
as well?

475
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:23,826
They see the prophecy
as disruptive.

476
00:42:24,585 --> 00:42:28,425
And it would seem that in this matter,
at least, your interests...

477
00:42:28,756 --> 00:42:30,756
...and theirs are the same.

478
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:40,772
Viciente will cease to be a problem.

479
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:44,122
It will all be over soon.

480
00:42:44,773 --> 00:42:47,733
I'm asking you not to interfere.

481
00:42:48,110 --> 00:42:49,590
Your Excellency.

482
00:43:04,835 --> 00:43:07,795
You and Marjorie have
come together for a reason, John.

483
00:43:08,131 --> 00:43:10,851
She's showing you the
third and fourth insights.

484
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:13,867
The prophecy says
we'll stop building ourselves up...

485
00:43:14,137 --> 00:43:16,857
...by taking energy from others.

486
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:22,740
There's another source, inside.
But we have to really connect with it.

487
00:43:23,146 --> 00:43:25,386
That's what Wil meant
when he said "open up."

488
00:43:25,941 --> 00:43:31,261
And if you open up enough, it literally
changes the way you see the world.

489
00:43:31,655 --> 00:43:35,095
But you have to really believe
the experience exists.

490
00:43:35,409 --> 00:43:38,209
Open yourself to the possibility that
there's something more...

491
00:43:38,496 --> 00:43:41,096
...right here in front of your eyes.

492
00:43:50,967 --> 00:43:52,807
Did you see that?

493
00:43:56,348 --> 00:43:58,908
Come on. I wanna show you
something over here.

494
00:44:08,611 --> 00:44:11,251
Wow, Julia, this place is so alive.

495
00:44:11,864 --> 00:44:13,304
It's amazing.

496
00:44:14,367 --> 00:44:16,767
Have a seat. Let's try something.

497
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,790
Put your fingers together like this.

498
00:44:25,211 --> 00:44:26,971
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

499
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:29,664
You're gonna look at the space
between your fingers.

500
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:35,746
Relax your focus just a bit.
What do you see?

501
00:44:38,767 --> 00:44:40,407
Look closely.

502
00:44:41,729 --> 00:44:43,889
Let your eyes
go out of focus just a bit.

503
00:44:47,568 --> 00:44:48,848
What do you see?

504
00:44:51,656 --> 00:44:53,936
It's like a wisp of smoke
or something.

505
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,040
That's the energy. Now look around.

506
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,000
See that philodendron?

507
00:45:01,291 --> 00:45:04,971
It's the opposite of trying to make
something happen. Just let go.

508
00:45:06,588 --> 00:45:08,148
Take in the plant.

509
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:13,574
The beauty, the color,
the way it stands out with presence.

510
00:45:15,097 --> 00:45:16,537
That's it.

511
00:45:19,852 --> 00:45:21,532
Breathe it in.

512
00:45:22,271 --> 00:45:24,511
Now take in more beauty.

513
00:45:26,192 --> 00:45:27,992
That's amazing.

514
00:45:28,611 --> 00:45:31,011
That's... Oh, hold on. I lost it.

515
00:45:31,489 --> 00:45:32,849
Here.

516
00:45:35,035 --> 00:45:35,995
Try again.

517
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:44,190
Wow, that's incredible!

518
00:45:44,962 --> 00:45:46,282
Senor!

519
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:49,541
Keep your focus, John.
You have to get this.

520
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,640
Senor John! Senor John!

521
00:45:53,471 --> 00:45:55,791
Senor, the gentleman
in the second cottage...

522
00:45:56,057 --> 00:45:57,697
...he need to speak to you
immediately.

523
00:45:57,975 --> 00:45:59,735
He says very important.

524
00:46:12,199 --> 00:46:14,239
- John.
- Hi.

525
00:46:14,493 --> 00:46:16,733
Miguel told me all about you.

526
00:46:17,746 --> 00:46:20,666
Listen, there's something
I have to talk to you about.

527
00:46:22,334 --> 00:46:23,654
How much do you know about Wil?

528
00:46:24,169 --> 00:46:27,449
Wil. I only just recently met him.

529
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,720
I'm sorry, but I have to tell you
Wil is wanted by the military police.

530
00:46:32,678 --> 00:46:34,078
What are you talking about?

531
00:46:34,347 --> 00:46:36,947
They are on the way
to arrest him now.

532
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,720
But if you allow me, I can help you.

533
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,340
How can you help me?

534
00:46:44,858 --> 00:46:47,578
Peru is a very dangerous place
for someone all alone.

535
00:46:47,861 --> 00:46:49,701
In over his head.

536
00:46:51,239 --> 00:46:53,439
I have official clearance
to study the prophecy.

537
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,460
I can move around freely.

538
00:46:55,702 --> 00:46:59,182
But I need you to tell me what
you know. Where's the missing scroll?

539
00:47:01,083 --> 00:47:02,043
I don't know anything.

540
00:47:04,045 --> 00:47:05,805
But you're one of them, John.

541
00:47:06,047 --> 00:47:08,287
They all accept you.
You must know something.

542
00:47:08,549 --> 00:47:10,589
I can even get you back
to the United States...

543
00:47:10,885 --> 00:47:12,845
...if that's what you want.

544
00:47:13,888 --> 00:47:16,888
But you have to leave with me
right now, before the soldiers come.

545
00:47:19,686 --> 00:47:22,006
John. John.

546
00:47:23,064 --> 00:47:24,144
John.

547
00:47:25,776 --> 00:47:29,736
John. We have to go.

548
00:47:30,072 --> 00:47:31,672
Don't listen to him.

549
00:47:31,907 --> 00:47:34,867
Your survival depends
on your staying with me.

550
00:47:39,248 --> 00:47:40,848
Are you coming?

551
00:47:48,925 --> 00:47:50,485
Yeah.

552
00:47:52,429 --> 00:47:54,469
You're making a bad mistake,
both of you.

553
00:47:54,764 --> 00:47:57,644
He was undermining your confidence.
Taking your energy.

554
00:47:57,934 --> 00:48:00,894
Now you know what it feels like
when someone does it to you.

555
00:48:01,188 --> 00:48:03,348
I felt weak. I couldn't think.

556
00:48:03,607 --> 00:48:05,687
He's just a remote controller.

557
00:48:05,943 --> 00:48:08,063
But you're probably
gonna have to deal with him...

558
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,280
...so you'd better figure it out.

559
00:48:10,906 --> 00:48:14,866
Wait. Is that in the prophecy too?

560
00:48:15,286 --> 00:48:18,766
There's a world of energy
that we are all going to understand.

561
00:48:19,123 --> 00:48:22,603
It's the real human condition.
Energy is what we all want.

562
00:48:22,919 --> 00:48:25,199
But we're stuck
battling for it with each other...

563
00:48:25,463 --> 00:48:27,903
...instead of finding it in ourselves.

564
00:48:28,216 --> 00:48:30,376
That's what you
still have to do, John.

565
00:48:30,844 --> 00:48:33,084
You haven't really
opened up, you know.

566
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:34,986
Wil. Wil.

567
00:48:36,308 --> 00:48:38,508
John. The military is on its way.

568
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:41,329
You need to leave.
Go while the north road is still open.

569
00:48:41,605 --> 00:48:44,045
- What about Julia and Marjorie?
- They've already left.

570
00:48:44,316 --> 00:48:47,036
You'll be behind them. I'm gonna
go to Lima, see the president.

571
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:48,919
Maybe something can still be done.

572
00:48:49,155 --> 00:48:51,675
- Listen, you remember my cabin?
- In the rain forest, yes.

573
00:48:51,991 --> 00:48:54,671
It's probably the safest place
for you now.

574
00:48:55,161 --> 00:48:56,561
Wil.

575
00:48:58,373 --> 00:49:01,693
- Finish this thing.
- Yes.

576
00:49:03,837 --> 00:49:05,437
Good luck, Miguel.

577
00:49:21,939 --> 00:49:24,419
Forgive me for what
I've allowed to happen.

578
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,322
Remember I told you
the way to Miguel's place?

579
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,978
Yeah?

580
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,040
If anything happens, you go there.
They'll need your help.

581
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,430
- What about you?
- I have to keep going.

582
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:27,242
I thought you were here
to find the ninth insight.

583
00:50:27,508 --> 00:50:29,468
Nothing's changed.

584
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:33,521
Just keep learning, John.
You'll find help.

585
00:50:33,806 --> 00:50:34,846
There's always help.

586
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,579
The right person
will come along if you stay alert.

587
00:50:38,519 --> 00:50:40,359
Something will happen for you.

588
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:01,232
What was that?

589
00:51:03,671 --> 00:51:07,031
Rebels. Sit tight.

590
00:51:08,509 --> 00:51:10,469
It's Julia's car.

591
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,148
My leg.

592
00:52:21,419 --> 00:52:22,819
Wait, wait!

593
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:25,458
- Julia!
- I'm okay. Find the cabin.

594
00:52:25,715 --> 00:52:27,915
I've got the translations.

595
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:41,250
How you feeling?

596
00:52:41,899 --> 00:52:43,379
- I'm terrified.
- You need to rest?

597
00:52:43,609 --> 00:52:45,969
No, no, let's keep going.

598
00:52:47,571 --> 00:52:49,651
- Is that Wil?
- What?

599
00:52:49,907 --> 00:52:51,547
- Stay here.
- No, no, John...

600
00:52:51,784 --> 00:52:53,504
I said, stay here!

601
00:53:02,587 --> 00:53:03,547
John!

602
00:53:06,842 --> 00:53:09,642
- John! Run!
- Marjorie!

603
00:54:12,661 --> 00:54:16,581
<i>Saint Francis could see beauty
where others couldn't. </i>

604
00:55:57,938 --> 00:56:01,738
I'm Father Sanchez. I can help you.

605
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,046
I remember you
from a photograph I saw.

606
00:56:09,325 --> 00:56:10,805
You and Father Jose.

607
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:13,835
Don't forget Wil. He was also there.

608
00:56:14,121 --> 00:56:17,201
Wil told me if I needed help,
someone would show up.

609
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:20,256
I guess he meant you.

610
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:26,820
Tell me what happened
on the cliffs, John.

611
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:31,172
I knew I was gonna die...

612
00:56:33,725 --> 00:56:35,685
...so I just let go.

613
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:39,780
Waited for the bullets.

614
00:56:43,485 --> 00:56:46,805
Then everything
began to change and I felt this...

615
00:56:47,406 --> 00:56:49,246
You had an amazing experience,
my friend.

616
00:56:49,492 --> 00:56:52,452
You opened up. You are changed.

617
00:56:53,037 --> 00:56:54,437
Did Wil explain this to you?

618
00:56:56,332 --> 00:56:57,612
He tried. I couldn't get it.

619
00:56:57,834 --> 00:56:59,634
Oh, you got more than you think.

620
00:57:00,169 --> 00:57:01,929
Tell me what you know.

621
00:57:03,673 --> 00:57:05,393
You mean the insights?

622
00:57:09,346 --> 00:57:14,466
Well, the first and the second
are about noticing the coincidences.

623
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:17,052
Things happen for a reason.

624
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,240
They're waking us up,
showing us the energy.

625
00:57:22,026 --> 00:57:23,786
And that's the third
and the fourth, right?

626
00:57:24,028 --> 00:57:26,748
I mean, that it's real
and people battle for it.

627
00:57:27,031 --> 00:57:28,951
Causes all the conflict in the world.

628
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,160
Between nations,
in the workplace, families.

629
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:33,291
There's only one solution.

630
00:57:34,914 --> 00:57:36,514
Opening up.

631
00:57:37,459 --> 00:57:39,419
Finding our own energy.

632
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:41,276
Fifth insight.

633
00:57:41,546 --> 00:57:43,306
Connects you
with the one true source:

634
00:57:43,548 --> 00:57:45,108
The real world.

635
00:57:46,385 --> 00:57:48,225
But I lost it. Why?

636
00:57:48,470 --> 00:57:50,150
Well, the prophecy says...

637
00:57:50,889 --> 00:57:53,569
...when you find this true connection
with the energy of God...

638
00:57:53,851 --> 00:57:56,131
...it's like a glimpse into the future.

639
00:57:56,729 --> 00:58:00,689
One day, we'll all see that way,
live in that world.

640
00:58:01,067 --> 00:58:04,427
But now it's a difficult thing
for anyone to maintain.

641
00:58:04,779 --> 00:58:06,699
We are evolving in that direction.

642
00:58:07,615 --> 00:58:10,055
I saw the world's evolution.

643
00:58:12,036 --> 00:58:14,116
How it all came to be.

644
00:58:14,372 --> 00:58:17,612
My life seemed to be a part
of everything, right up to now.

645
00:58:18,001 --> 00:58:21,481
Everything made sense.
Growing up at the lake...

646
00:58:22,339 --> 00:58:24,779
...working with kids,
trying to understand history.

647
00:58:25,092 --> 00:58:27,172
I spent my life
thinking there was something more.

648
00:58:27,428 --> 00:58:31,908
That's the sixth insight. It says we are
part of a larger flow of evolution.

649
00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:33,906
We are here to do something.

650
00:58:34,143 --> 00:58:36,143
And if we are true to that purpose...

651
00:58:36,395 --> 00:58:39,155
...we'll help move humanity
towards the world you saw.

652
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:41,360
But I don't know
what I'm supposed to do.

653
00:58:41,609 --> 00:58:43,369
That's because
you're not through yet.

654
00:58:44,696 --> 00:58:47,456
How to know what to do next
is the seventh.

655
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,790
You have to discover your guidance.

656
00:58:53,622 --> 00:58:54,902
You're talking about hunches?

657
00:58:56,875 --> 00:58:58,515
Intuitions? I've seen Wil have those.

658
00:58:58,794 --> 00:59:02,114
If you stay alert,
you'll notice certain ideas...

659
00:59:02,423 --> 00:59:03,983
...images coming into your mind.

660
00:59:04,216 --> 00:59:06,136
They're there to guide you.

661
00:59:06,635 --> 00:59:09,795
Follow them and the coincidences
begin to increase.

662
00:59:10,097 --> 00:59:11,817
Just step into the flow.

663
00:59:12,058 --> 00:59:14,258
I don't think I've ever
experienced that before.

664
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:17,599
You just need to open the door again.
Get some more energy.

665
00:59:17,897 --> 00:59:19,537
You remember
how you felt on the cliff?

666
00:59:19,774 --> 00:59:20,934
How the world looked?

667
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:24,520
Just breathe in the memory.

668
00:59:45,134 --> 00:59:46,934
You were daydreaming.

669
00:59:48,012 --> 00:59:49,972
Yeah, I guess I was.

670
00:59:51,224 --> 00:59:52,944
What was coming to you?

671
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,720
I was thinking about Marjorie.

672
00:59:58,773 --> 01:00:01,333
How it's my fault
that she got captured.

673
01:00:02,069 --> 01:00:03,949
What all were you seeing?

674
01:00:05,197 --> 01:00:07,757
- I don't know.
- No, come on, think.

675
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:09,953
Most people
overlook these experiences.

676
01:00:11,912 --> 01:00:15,032
Well, it's the same thing
I saw yesterday on the mountain.

677
01:00:15,541 --> 01:00:17,541
And it felt like the future.

678
01:00:21,172 --> 01:00:26,652
She was in this place,
surrounded by dense jungle.

679
01:00:27,971 --> 01:00:29,411
Go on.

680
01:00:30,181 --> 01:00:32,261
Well, she was looking at something.

681
01:00:33,727 --> 01:00:36,447
A small flower.
A small yellow flower.

682
01:00:37,189 --> 01:00:38,829
Well, that's clear enough.

683
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,000
Yeah, clear as mud.

684
01:00:42,236 --> 01:00:43,796
You know you have to do something.

685
01:00:44,071 --> 01:00:45,511
Except you don't know what.

686
01:00:45,739 --> 01:00:47,299
Then you have
this image of Marjorie.

687
01:00:47,575 --> 01:00:50,895
Well, that little daydream of yours
was a guidance.

688
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:54,446
Okay. I'll buy that.

689
01:00:56,459 --> 01:00:58,219
What's it saying?

690
01:00:59,170 --> 01:01:01,370
You saw her in the rain forest?

691
01:01:02,924 --> 01:01:06,924
Well, the rain forest is that way.

692
01:01:07,971 --> 01:01:10,611
I don't know if I should do this.
Maybe I should go with you.

693
01:01:10,932 --> 01:01:12,892
There's no need. I can find Julia.

694
01:01:13,143 --> 01:01:17,983
You have to go your own way.
Follow your own intuition alone.

695
01:01:18,357 --> 01:01:21,157
We can't do anything without Marjorie,
so get moving. Find her.

696
01:01:21,443 --> 01:01:22,723
I'll see you at Miguel's cabin.

697
01:01:22,945 --> 01:01:24,705
Find her?
I don't know where I'm going!

698
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:28,467
None of us know where we're going.
Not really. Just listen inside.

699
01:01:28,784 --> 01:01:33,024
Pay attention to the way things look.
Something will happen.

700
01:02:51,663 --> 01:02:54,903
Father Jose?
We thought you were dead.

701
01:02:55,208 --> 01:02:59,568
Well, things are not always
as they seem, John.

702
01:03:01,131 --> 01:03:04,891
I thought I was on the right path.
I guess I made a mistake.

703
01:03:05,219 --> 01:03:08,099
<i>It's a mistake
to think the worst too quickly.</i>

704
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:12,789
Always find the deeper meaning,
the silver lining.

705
01:03:14,061 --> 01:03:16,701
That's what keeps you in the flow.

706
01:04:15,334 --> 01:04:17,814
- Marjorie.
- John.

707
01:04:21,048 --> 01:04:24,648
I don't know how this is happening.
It's just...

708
01:04:27,805 --> 01:04:28,885
Don't worry.

709
01:04:29,307 --> 01:04:31,747
- We're gonna get out of here.
- Okay.

710
01:05:42,509 --> 01:05:46,189
Okay. What now?

711
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:57,550
This is it.

712
01:07:00,048 --> 01:07:01,208
Thank you.

713
01:07:04,762 --> 01:07:06,082
Okay.

714
01:07:13,312 --> 01:07:15,032
Okay.

715
01:07:17,942 --> 01:07:20,742
All right, I've been to Miguel's cabin
once before and I...

716
01:07:24,491 --> 01:07:26,451
Wanna know what I think?

717
01:07:26,826 --> 01:07:29,986
I think we should make for the border
and get out of Peru while we can.

718
01:07:30,288 --> 01:07:31,768
Have you forgotten why we're here?

719
01:07:31,999 --> 01:07:35,199
We could try to contact the others
when we get there. No more shooting.

720
01:07:35,502 --> 01:07:38,702
John, you're past this.
Listen to yourself.

721
01:07:39,006 --> 01:07:41,126
Now, I promise you,
I can find this place.

722
01:07:41,383 --> 01:07:43,383
You just give me a minute, all right?

723
01:07:46,514 --> 01:07:48,074
- No.
- Hold on.

724
01:07:48,307 --> 01:07:49,947
- It's too dangerous. Marjorie.
- Hold on.

725
01:07:50,184 --> 01:07:52,704
- Will you talk to me, please?
- You don't wanna talk.

726
01:07:53,021 --> 01:07:56,101
To talk, you'd have to actually listen
to what another person is feeling.

727
01:07:56,399 --> 01:07:58,159
- You're dense as a post.
- I'm trying to...

728
01:07:58,401 --> 01:08:00,601
You're controlling, John,
because you're scared...

729
01:08:00,862 --> 01:08:03,142
...and it's wearing me down.
It can't happen anymore.

730
01:08:03,406 --> 01:08:07,406
Not if I can help it. L...
John. Leave me alone.

731
01:08:50,873 --> 01:08:53,633
Hey, what took you so long?
Julia! They're here.

732
01:08:53,918 --> 01:08:55,278
You did it.

733
01:08:59,382 --> 01:09:02,902
- What's going on?
- Oh, it's okay. Don't ask.

734
01:09:06,765 --> 01:09:09,765
Come on, John, you did great.
Come on in.

735
01:09:29,622 --> 01:09:32,422
Come on, give me another chance.

736
01:09:34,585 --> 01:09:37,145
You're the one that's supposed to be
good at all this stuff.

737
01:09:37,463 --> 01:09:41,343
You are not making this easy on me.
I am doing the best I can...

738
01:09:41,676 --> 01:09:43,356
...but I don't have it figured out yet.

739
01:09:43,595 --> 01:09:46,355
You can start by calming down.

740
01:09:51,812 --> 01:09:54,692
I can be a little
hard-edged sometimes.

741
01:09:58,402 --> 01:10:00,522
I've always gotten lost
in other people.

742
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:03,740
Guys. Mostly the charming ones.

743
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:07,113
Not stood my ground
when it was really important...

744
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:09,051
...and I vowed to myself,
not anymore...

745
01:10:09,330 --> 01:10:13,010
...and then you come along,
like it's some kind of test for me, and...

746
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:18,943
...I just get angry because I don't
wanna slide backwards, John.

747
01:10:19,341 --> 01:10:20,781
Neither do I.

748
01:10:21,343 --> 01:10:24,543
That's why I wanna find out exactly
what happened and get through this.

749
01:10:25,889 --> 01:10:28,449
The couple thing is the hardest thing
to work out.

750
01:10:28,725 --> 01:10:30,645
Especially if the relationship
is familiar...

751
01:10:30,894 --> 01:10:33,254
...if it feels
like I've known you before.

752
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:39,771
Did you think I didn't feel it?

753
01:10:48,121 --> 01:10:52,001
When couples first meet, usually
there is this wonderful feeling...

754
01:10:52,334 --> 01:10:54,294
...but it almost never lasts.

755
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,080
One person gets insecure
and starts controlling...

756
01:10:57,339 --> 01:10:59,819
...wanting more
from the other person, and...

757
01:11:00,092 --> 01:11:05,172
...the other one gets threatened
and backs away...

758
01:11:05,556 --> 01:11:09,036
...and it leads to a power struggle.
- It doesn't have to be that way.

759
01:11:12,104 --> 01:11:13,824
No, it doesn't.

760
01:11:14,899 --> 01:11:16,539
I mean...

761
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:19,900
...if both people stay connected...

762
01:11:20,154 --> 01:11:23,154
...then whoever has
the strongest intuition leads...

763
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:26,930
...and there's no competition.

764
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:30,301
Control is shared,
and that's the relationship I want.

765
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:33,502
That's just it,
I can't stay connected.

766
01:11:36,213 --> 01:11:39,533
I want to, but I'm not there yet.

767
01:11:40,259 --> 01:11:41,899
But there is a way, John.

768
01:11:42,136 --> 01:11:45,296
And we all have to work on
doing this one critical thing.

769
01:11:45,598 --> 01:11:49,078
It's what I need to remember
instead of getting angry all the time.

770
01:11:51,395 --> 01:11:54,115
I mean, that's the eighth insight.

771
01:11:55,858 --> 01:11:57,018
Come here.

772
01:11:59,612 --> 01:12:05,372
It says that instead of taking energy
from each other, you give it.

773
01:12:05,786 --> 01:12:08,786
All the time, no matter what.

774
01:12:12,626 --> 01:12:15,066
Like Father Sanchez is doing.

775
01:12:16,630 --> 01:12:18,150
Look at him, John.

776
01:12:19,133 --> 01:12:20,933
Really look.

777
01:12:31,563 --> 01:12:33,883
Giving energy is a process.

778
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:37,229
When someone's energy increases,
you can see it in their expression.

779
01:12:37,819 --> 01:12:40,139
So you look
for that higher expression.

780
01:12:40,405 --> 01:12:42,525
And in every situation...

781
01:12:42,783 --> 01:12:46,943
...you know your energy is moving
into them when you get a feeling.

782
01:12:47,955 --> 01:12:49,115
A feeling?

783
01:12:49,331 --> 01:12:53,451
On the cliff, when you opened up,
remember? What did you feel?

784
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:58,784
I felt a kind of completeness.

785
01:12:59,467 --> 01:13:01,387
A wholeness. This...

786
01:13:03,096 --> 01:13:05,416
This unmatched euphoria.

787
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:09,680
- You're talking about love, aren't you?
- Yes.

788
01:13:10,437 --> 01:13:12,717
Giving is the secret
to keeping yourself connected...

789
01:13:12,981 --> 01:13:15,261
...because your energy, your love...

790
01:13:15,609 --> 01:13:18,769
...builds up in you first
as it flows out to others.

791
01:13:19,071 --> 01:13:21,791
It's what the saints
have always known how to do.

792
01:13:22,366 --> 01:13:24,966
It's what you and I have to do now
to help them.

793
01:13:44,472 --> 01:13:46,192
Wait a minute.

794
01:13:47,601 --> 01:13:49,521
Maybe we're misreading this.

795
01:13:49,770 --> 01:13:51,370
Father Sanchez, John, come here.

796
01:13:51,605 --> 01:13:54,085
I found something
in the translations.

797
01:13:54,399 --> 01:13:57,719
Look at this. This phrase:

798
01:14:00,990 --> 01:14:04,830
- What does it mean?
- It means, roughly, to amplify.

799
01:14:05,202 --> 01:14:09,202
I thought it just referred to one person
giving energy to another.

800
01:14:09,999 --> 01:14:12,199
But now I think it's something more.

801
01:14:14,963 --> 01:14:18,083
<i>It's one thing to just give energy... </i>

802
01:14:18,383 --> 01:14:22,263
<i>... but if we give it to someone
who is also giving it back... </i>

803
01:14:22,596 --> 01:14:26,396
<i>... then we build energy
among ourselves. </i>

804
01:14:27,768 --> 01:14:31,448
<i>It amplifies, back and forth. </i>

805
01:14:34,942 --> 01:14:37,062
<i>It says if we were all doing this... </i>

806
01:14:37,319 --> 01:14:40,359
<i>... humanity would take another step
in evolution. </i>

807
01:14:46,955 --> 01:14:49,155
Does it say where we'll go?

808
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:52,961
<i>Maybe that's what the ninth
is going to tell us. </i>

809
01:14:58,759 --> 01:15:02,119
That's it. Isn't it?

810
01:15:04,473 --> 01:15:06,633
That's where it's gonna happen.

811
01:15:24,369 --> 01:15:26,049
Hey, John, we have to get going.

812
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:34,191
It'll take about two hours
to get to the ruins from here.

813
01:15:34,463 --> 01:15:36,823
Does anyone know
exactly where to start looking?

814
01:15:41,220 --> 01:15:43,580
There's someone who knows
exactly where to look.

815
01:16:51,293 --> 01:16:54,573
You got it all, John.
All the prophecy that we know.

816
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,440
You've caught up.

817
01:17:04,432 --> 01:17:06,712
Now you live in our world.

818
01:17:24,328 --> 01:17:28,728
You could just let it go.
You don't owe anything to anyone.

819
01:17:30,626 --> 01:17:33,986
No, you go ahead.
I'll catch up with you.

820
01:17:37,133 --> 01:17:39,293
I think I have to go with him.

821
01:17:47,644 --> 01:17:51,284
- So why have you come here?
- To seek reconciliation.

822
01:17:51,606 --> 01:17:53,446
I want you to understand
the course I chose.

823
01:17:53,692 --> 01:17:57,292
There's nothing to understand.
All this talk about prophecy must end.

824
01:17:57,613 --> 01:17:59,653
The people have the right
to know what it says.

825
01:18:00,157 --> 01:18:03,277
It makes our religion,
it makes every religion, come alive.

826
01:18:03,911 --> 01:18:05,071
- Really?
- Of course.

827
01:18:05,329 --> 01:18:08,489
- Look what it's done to us.
- Hear me, please.

828
01:18:13,046 --> 01:18:17,646
From the time of Peter, the Church
has been about faith, about belief.

829
01:18:18,009 --> 01:18:20,609
We have kept that belief alive.

830
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,336
But we can go past that now.

831
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:27,125
We can begin to live the promises.
The kingdom can come now.

832
01:18:27,436 --> 01:18:28,996
It can all lead to chaos.

833
01:18:29,229 --> 01:18:32,309
No. The guidance inside
will prevent that.

834
01:18:32,608 --> 01:18:35,648
The perception can expand
and evolve.

835
01:18:36,237 --> 01:18:37,917
Evolve?

836
01:18:38,864 --> 01:18:41,144
Listen carefully
to what you are saying.

837
01:18:41,409 --> 01:18:44,369
We have always fought
against the idea of evolution.

838
01:18:44,704 --> 01:18:47,824
Against the idea
of evolution without God.

839
01:18:48,124 --> 01:18:51,884
But evolution is a creation
that's still happening.

840
01:18:52,212 --> 01:18:53,772
We can all participate.

841
01:18:54,047 --> 01:18:56,727
Don't lecture me about theology!

842
01:18:58,844 --> 01:19:01,204
Only God creates, not us.

843
01:19:01,471 --> 01:19:04,071
But it happens through us,
don't you see?

844
01:19:07,394 --> 01:19:09,954
You protected
the Franciscan documents.

845
01:19:10,231 --> 01:19:11,831
You showed us
where the scrolls were.

846
01:19:12,483 --> 01:19:15,123
They were placed in the ruins
for some reason.

847
01:19:15,403 --> 01:19:17,283
It's time to find out why.

848
01:19:17,697 --> 01:19:20,017
Please, join us.

849
01:19:22,368 --> 01:19:26,088
No. It must end.

850
01:19:26,748 --> 01:19:28,748
It doesn't matter now.

851
01:19:31,169 --> 01:19:36,209
There will be no ruins,
be no ninth insight. Nothing.

852
01:19:37,301 --> 01:19:38,861
What have you done?

853
01:19:39,720 --> 01:19:40,840
It's over.

854
01:19:41,722 --> 01:19:43,762
It's out of our hands now.

855
01:20:02,744 --> 01:20:04,304
Come on.
We need to find the others.

856
01:20:04,537 --> 01:20:07,657
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
It's Jensen.

857
01:20:09,543 --> 01:20:11,343
We gotta get moving.

858
01:20:12,212 --> 01:20:15,132
Remember you told me
I need to follow my own intuition?

859
01:20:19,220 --> 01:20:21,060
This is mine to do.

860
01:20:52,421 --> 01:20:54,021
So where's the ninth scroll?

861
01:20:58,636 --> 01:21:02,636
You should have come with me before,
when I gave you the chance.

862
01:21:03,516 --> 01:21:06,476
You're gonna destroy the ruins.
Aren't you?

863
01:21:07,228 --> 01:21:09,228
Let's just say
there are people out there...

864
01:21:09,481 --> 01:21:11,561
...who want certain things
to happen.

865
01:21:11,816 --> 01:21:14,136
Your prophecy isn't one of them.

866
01:21:14,486 --> 01:21:16,126
How did you think
this would end, huh?

867
01:21:16,363 --> 01:21:18,803
If you only knew
what the prophecy says...

868
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:20,314
...how the world really is...

869
01:21:20,534 --> 01:21:22,974
The world is the way it is
because we make it that way.

870
01:21:23,245 --> 01:21:26,085
When there's prosperity, we create it.
When there's war...

871
01:21:26,373 --> 01:21:28,293
...well, sometimes war
can be useful too.

872
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:32,858
- You wanna destroy this democracy?
- Not destroy.

873
01:21:33,172 --> 01:21:34,732
Limit.

874
01:21:34,966 --> 01:21:37,846
Progress depends
on people's willingness to be led.

875
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:40,120
The world has changed.

876
01:21:40,388 --> 01:21:42,428
Religious fanatics
are threatening everything.

877
01:21:42,724 --> 01:21:45,924
Now this prophecy pops up again
after hundreds of years.

878
01:21:47,771 --> 01:21:51,091
Oh, yes. I know all about it.

879
01:21:51,399 --> 01:21:52,959
We have our writings too.

880
01:21:53,235 --> 01:21:55,435
We've always known the dangers
of what it promises.

881
01:21:55,696 --> 01:21:59,216
This dreamy liberation.
The illusion of security.

882
01:21:59,533 --> 01:22:00,773
It undermines everything.

883
01:22:00,993 --> 01:22:04,713
It's not an illusion. It's real.
It's the only thing that's real.

884
01:22:05,664 --> 01:22:07,984
Trying to control isn't the answer.

885
01:22:08,250 --> 01:22:10,650
When we find
the true God experience...

886
01:22:10,920 --> 01:22:14,160
...the fight over whose religion
is best, it fades.

887
01:22:15,216 --> 01:22:19,536
- There's just one truth.
- You people, so naive.

888
01:22:19,888 --> 01:22:23,408
Thinking there's something spiritual
guiding this world.

889
01:22:23,934 --> 01:22:26,814
Well, there's nothing out there.

890
01:22:27,104 --> 01:22:28,544
Just us humans.

891
01:22:28,772 --> 01:22:31,972
And those of us who know that
will always be in control.

892
01:22:35,404 --> 01:22:37,804
The way of this world...

893
01:22:39,158 --> 01:22:40,838
...is power.

894
01:22:47,792 --> 01:22:51,512
- Can't let you do this.
- You could never stop me.

895
01:22:57,969 --> 01:23:00,969
You idiot! You have killed us all!

896
01:23:38,595 --> 01:23:42,315
John, I found the others.
Let's get to the circle.

897
01:23:44,518 --> 01:23:46,558
I'll be right back.

898
01:23:52,026 --> 01:23:53,946
You feel that?

899
01:23:55,530 --> 01:23:57,250
It's happening.

900
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:05,498
Someone's helping us.

901
01:24:07,709 --> 01:24:12,389
Send the energy back. It will build.
Remember?

902
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:31,674
Oh, my...

903
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,472
How incredible is this?

904
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:41,000
I can read it.

905
01:24:42,829 --> 01:24:45,029
I can read this. It says:

906
01:24:45,499 --> 01:24:50,299
"The guidance within
evolves the world towards a...

907
01:24:50,671 --> 01:24:52,991
Towards a heaven
that is already here.

908
01:24:53,257 --> 01:24:56,297
To know this
is to know our destiny."

909
01:25:30,921 --> 01:25:34,161
- Wil?
- You made it here first.

910
01:25:34,634 --> 01:25:36,514
Wherever this is.

911
01:25:37,637 --> 01:25:39,357
You were helping us, weren't you?

912
01:25:39,806 --> 01:25:42,846
- Father Jose.
- He's been helping us too.

913
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:52,357
They're all helping us.

914
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:54,421
We are being shown heaven.

915
01:26:06,167 --> 01:26:08,287
It's where evolution is taking us.

916
01:26:08,544 --> 01:26:11,064
Where it's always been taking us.

917
01:26:15,343 --> 01:26:17,623
That's the ninth insight.

918
01:26:19,055 --> 01:26:21,655
No! Don't hurt her,
she's just a child.

919
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:25,640
No, keep your energy.
Hold on, they'll see you.

920
01:26:26,688 --> 01:26:27,888
Julia.

921
01:26:32,820 --> 01:26:34,500
Stay focused. Keep your energy.

922
01:26:36,740 --> 01:26:38,220
John.

923
01:26:59,764 --> 01:27:02,244
Take them to the ridge!

924
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,024
Marjorie? I wanna
tell you something.

925
01:27:42,309 --> 01:27:44,629
I don't think we have much time left.

926
01:27:45,521 --> 01:27:49,681
But I wanna thank you for all of it,
for everything you've shown me.

927
01:27:50,234 --> 01:27:53,114
I was a reluctant student at first,
I know, but I'm glad you...

928
01:27:53,404 --> 01:27:54,644
...didn't give up on me.

929
01:27:56,157 --> 01:27:58,597
I think I was the stubborn one.

930
01:28:00,954 --> 01:28:03,674
And, John, we weren't
supposed to be together.

931
01:28:03,957 --> 01:28:07,117
Not this time. We were just
supposed to find a balance.

932
01:28:10,380 --> 01:28:12,300
I think we did.

933
01:28:12,549 --> 01:28:13,949
Yeah.

934
01:28:30,777 --> 01:28:32,537
In the name of God. Wait!

935
01:28:33,112 --> 01:28:34,152
Lower your weapons!

936
01:28:35,782 --> 01:28:38,182
These people
can do you no harm now.

937
01:28:38,576 --> 01:28:40,896
They'll have no credibility.
I'm making sure of it.

938
01:28:41,162 --> 01:28:44,562
This is not your affair,
Your Excellency.

939
01:28:45,125 --> 01:28:46,525
No.

940
01:28:51,465 --> 01:28:55,585
Let them live. We're not murderers.
The prophecy has been destroyed.

941
01:28:56,804 --> 01:28:59,124
The jungle will take the ruins.

942
01:28:59,932 --> 01:29:02,372
Nothing is left of this prophecy.

943
01:29:02,685 --> 01:29:04,965
The prophecy is finished.

944
01:29:11,569 --> 01:29:12,849
Take them to Lima.

945
01:29:46,898 --> 01:29:48,498
I knew it was you.

946
01:29:51,069 --> 01:29:52,669
It's pretty intense in there.

947
01:29:52,904 --> 01:29:56,064
I have 45 minutes to leave the country.
They got me on the next plane out.

948
01:30:00,287 --> 01:30:01,487
What about the others?

949
01:30:01,914 --> 01:30:03,154
Marjorie?

950
01:30:03,374 --> 01:30:04,814
She's already back home.

951
01:30:05,084 --> 01:30:07,324
She was there to set you free.

952
01:30:08,379 --> 01:30:10,539
Julia and the girl,
they're all right too.

953
01:30:13,259 --> 01:30:14,499
Wil?

954
01:30:17,138 --> 01:30:19,178
The scrolls? The translations?
Anything left?

955
01:30:19,432 --> 01:30:20,952
They don't matter, John.

956
01:30:21,184 --> 01:30:23,184
We were able
to understand the ninth.

957
01:30:24,270 --> 01:30:26,990
Now we know
what life is really about.

958
01:30:27,607 --> 01:30:29,647
That changes everything.

959
01:30:31,820 --> 01:30:33,180
Here.

960
01:30:33,655 --> 01:30:35,655
I thought you'd find this interesting.

961
01:30:38,619 --> 01:30:40,819
How about that?
We made the news.

962
01:30:43,207 --> 01:30:45,447
She sent me here.

963
01:30:46,294 --> 01:30:48,814
Maybe now you can
have something real.

964
01:30:52,467 --> 01:30:53,907
Yeah.

965
01:30:55,595 --> 01:30:57,355
Maybe I can.

966
01:31:01,142 --> 01:31:03,662
So, what are you going to do now?

967
01:31:04,563 --> 01:31:06,523
I don't know. I don't know.

968
01:31:06,815 --> 01:31:09,175
You have to take all this
with you, John.

969
01:31:09,443 --> 01:31:11,643
You'll meet others
who have to know.

970
01:31:12,988 --> 01:31:14,948
Just keep your eyes open.

971
01:31:16,075 --> 01:31:18,315
Something will always happen.

972
01:31:29,005 --> 01:31:30,405
One last thing.

973
01:31:31,132 --> 01:31:33,892
Something tells me
you'll be getting a message.

974
01:31:35,011 --> 01:31:36,571
From Wil.

975
01:32:16,680 --> 01:32:18,280
Magazine?

976
01:32:19,016 --> 01:32:20,376
Thank you.

977
01:33:02,436 --> 01:33:03,876
There's a tenth insight.

978
01:33:09,152 --> 01:33:10,712
There's a tenth insight.
