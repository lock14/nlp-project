00:02:48,575 --> 00:02:49,437
Grendel

3
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:55,739
Pappie

4
00:03:48,543 --> 00:03:51,740
Yahhhhh!!! Yahhhhhh

5
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:23,613
Ahhhh Owwee.

6
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,758
Aohhhhheeweee

7
00:07:36,831 --> 00:07:38,293
Yoeyeo

8
00:07:38,431 --> 00:07:44,858
Yahhhheeoooooooooweewaaaa

9
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:01,397
Let this great horn tell the world
no man stands above the Danes.

10
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:05,401
All we look up on is ours.

11
00:08:06,623 --> 00:08:10,900
Hrothgar much loved king of the Danes.

12
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:17,214
Under Odirs eye I blood you lucky
on all parts that leave this hall.

13
00:08:22,272 --> 00:08:25,850
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!

14
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:31,199
Blahhhhhhhhhehhhhhhahhhhh!

15
00:08:31,712 --> 00:08:37,876
Ahhhhhh! Blehhahhhhh!

16
00:08:51,039 --> 00:08:56,090
May all those who cross
these steps find a happy heart.

17
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:57,915
Yay!

18
00:09:37,823 --> 00:09:38,772
Olaf!

19
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,589
Olaf! Pal!

20
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,646
Where were you when all this happened?

21
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:45,977
Asleep.

22
00:10:49,152 --> 00:10:50,526
I'd had some beers.

23
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,323
What fucking thing would dare...

24
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:35,445
G'day

25
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,039
G'Day.

26
00:12:42,207 --> 00:12:44,793
I'd love much to know man, whereabouts?

27
00:12:46,112 --> 00:12:47,453
Fish beach.

28
00:12:48,128 --> 00:12:50,200
Likely I'm the only one
who names it that.

29
00:12:51,168 --> 00:12:52,412
Where I get fish.

30
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:57,302
I'm Beowulf

31
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,388
Beowulf?

32
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:03,231
Yea Beowulf the what?
Heh? The eel meal?

33
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:12,951
You've never had another?
Wash up like myself?

34
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:15,933
In the name of Breca? Ahhh.

35
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:21,364
We were out hunting walrus
a couple of days ago...

36
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:24,249
when a storm came up and ate our boat.

37
00:13:25,216 --> 00:13:27,125
So this is just you coming in now?

38
00:13:28,127 --> 00:13:29,175
Yeah

39
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:34,937
You've ever swum in the open sea?

40
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,957
I leave that to my boat.

41
00:13:38,495 --> 00:13:40,437
Ahh. I'd like to think you'd botter me.

42
00:13:41,248 --> 00:13:45,241
I can't see much life in that.
Do you do this a lot?

43
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:47,326
I take what comes.

44
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:52,190
Good then you'll have no qualms
if supper tastes like you.

45
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,435
Eat, be yourself.

46
00:14:03,103 --> 00:14:06,900
So, what's it like being a hero?

47
00:14:07,424 --> 00:14:12,246
Qualling things with axes and,
and that sword of yours. And what.

48
00:14:12,672 --> 00:14:15,355
Kinda bloody madness. Heh

49
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,005
In truth I don't get all that mad.

50
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,717
So, ahhh hahh-hhhah,
A hero ahhh, A hero for supper.

51
00:14:43,392 --> 00:14:46,326
Don't my shit shine.
Hah, hahhhh, hahhh

52
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:48,893
I'm in your debt

53
00:14:50,591 --> 00:14:57,116
I'm in the fishes.
All these days have come for theirs.

54
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:11,381
The winds were kind.

55
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,992
No storm waylaid Sawthwood
from his hard walk home.

56
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:21,528
None in Geatland held so strong the love
of kin as Beowulf.

57
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:24,280
But coming home he heard the tale.

58
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:27,798
Friends to the west
slept with slaughter.

59
00:15:28,031 --> 00:15:31,861
...from death upon the Danes.

60
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:36,535
Great Beowulf alone had best it bares
thought fearless in their mood

61
00:15:36,671 --> 00:15:39,967
for men but now he brought a half score

62
00:15:40,095 --> 00:15:43,925
or more Geat swords
to swing against this thing.

63
00:15:44,064 --> 00:15:45,438
Let's hear the names

64
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:48,949
Breca the loud.

65
00:15:49,087 --> 00:15:50,680
HahhhAhhhh

66
00:15:50,815 --> 00:15:52,441
Right from the seas.

67
00:15:52,864 --> 00:15:55,417
Lost no son in hoisting sword.

68
00:15:55,552 --> 00:15:56,479
Hoisting swords?

69
00:15:56,608 --> 00:15:58,615
He couldn't hoist his own sail.

70
00:15:59,072 --> 00:16:02,683
The huncho. Queller of puffins

71
00:16:02,816 --> 00:16:04,507
Hahhh.

72
00:16:04,736 --> 00:16:06,263
...and beer.

73
00:16:07,039 --> 00:16:09,211
Shook his shields to shake the world.

74
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:12,246
No. Just on that scum troll's head.

75
00:16:15,423 --> 00:16:16,471
Beowulf.

76
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:31,190
Well as we've done these last few years
this sail holds grim bliss for me.

77
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,102
A thing that takes two hundred
in arms is no small thing.

78
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,556
But I will see Valhalla
or that thing's head on a pole.

79
00:16:42,688 --> 00:16:44,827
Aye, aye, aye

80
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:51,484
So that Danes might say Geats don't
wield words where swords speak truer.

81
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:53,754
Ayyye. Yea.

82
00:16:58,144 --> 00:17:04,341
Great as our own shield king Is,
there is another nearest kin to me.

83
00:17:07,136 --> 00:17:11,675
None bleed for a better king
than Hrothgar I'd die happy.

84
00:17:11,807 --> 00:17:13,236
Loved as he.

85
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:16,539
But we live happy even now.

86
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:26,836
So, Beowulf goes at dawn to the Danes
all you who go along, keep us proud.

87
00:17:26,975 --> 00:17:30,521
Yeahhh!

88
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:33,847
And if you can find Hondscioh
a wife our sheep have had enough.

89
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:02,616
Troll!!!!!!!!!

90
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:16,894
Trollllllllll!

91
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:24,213
Trollll!!!!!! I call you out!!!!

92
00:19:27,136 --> 00:19:28,281
Trolll!!!!

93
00:19:35,455 --> 00:19:38,270
Trollllllllllllllll!!!!!!!

94
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:48,118
Meet me the like if you dare!
Or fight me in hell. You hairy creep.

95
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,335
Creep. Creep!

96
00:19:53,056 --> 00:19:54,332
Ahhhmmm.

97
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:33,528
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!

98
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,294
Are you wounded?

99
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,731
The thing wouldn't fight.
It spared me to witness this.

100
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,180
Then get up off your arse
with your Thanes insight.

101
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,497
This is no ground for a game.

102
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,730
Ahh, you're wrong where a king
who has had his balls hauled up

103
00:21:00,864 --> 00:21:02,806
his guts it is the ground.

104
00:21:04,608 --> 00:21:07,903
All the broken bone wretches
I've flung to death.

105
00:21:08,031 --> 00:21:09,526
And to Valhalla.

106
00:21:11,263 --> 00:21:12,540
I don't know.

107
00:21:16,736 --> 00:21:20,314
Is that the look of
a man going happily up to the feast?

108
00:21:20,607 --> 00:21:22,069
Or down to the worms?

109
00:21:22,207 --> 00:21:23,352
You talk like a mad man.

110
00:21:23,487 --> 00:21:26,171
No!
Just like the Danish king of daylight

111
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:28,670
Get up now or do we bury you here?

112
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,174
Is that your wish?

113
00:21:37,183 --> 00:21:38,939
With your thanes in sight?

114
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,291
Whose wife would you have me be?

115
00:22:07,231 --> 00:22:13,526
A burly sword of Christ to cleave you
thus, and thus and thus!

116
00:22:36,416 --> 00:22:38,488
That's one shiny sword.

117
00:22:41,791 --> 00:22:43,613
I'm told you're the Dane's king.

118
00:22:44,031 --> 00:22:45,493
Connaught wishes you well

119
00:22:47,551 --> 00:22:49,340
Celt, you're a ways from home

120
00:22:49,471 --> 00:22:54,806
I am but safe with the sword of Christ.
Father Brendan.

121
00:22:55,104 --> 00:23:01,781
Christ. I - Heard of him.
You ever have much luck with trolls?

122
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,440
I'm of the thought
they've never crossed paths,

123
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:07,165
but if you're willing to bow
before Christ you shall feel

124
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:09,435
the blessing of his great strength.

125
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,870
My gods don't ask me to bow.

126
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,847
And nor should they dare
if they won't protect ye.

127
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:20,989
To fear god's fools is an honor.
I've come to drive this evil out.

128
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:23,095
With your stick?

129
00:23:23,231 --> 00:23:24,922
With the fire of heaven!

130
00:23:24,991 --> 00:23:27,708
Well if your heavers on fire
you'd better look to that.

131
00:23:28,543 --> 00:23:30,649
You leave me
on a dish for the troll then.

132
00:23:30,847 --> 00:23:33,116
Leave me.
And if I don't see mars stone.

133
00:23:33,248 --> 00:23:36,379
I shall see god's! I shall see god!

134
00:23:36,831 --> 00:23:37,693
Ahhh!

135
00:23:56,927 --> 00:24:00,091
Selma, should I fear for my husband?

136
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,829
You've got nothing better to do?

137
00:24:07,968 --> 00:24:12,026
Sweet don't play the bitch with me.
I don't ask much and I don't ask often.

138
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,810
No one dares dirty your name around me.

139
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,051
Nor yours around me.

140
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:29,662
Hrothgar dies happy, in his sleep.

141
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,094
That's a lift.

142
00:24:40,096 --> 00:24:44,569
Selma, I could find
a place for you inside.

143
00:24:47,168 --> 00:24:49,371
We chose our beds along time back.

144
00:25:17,119 --> 00:25:18,199
Men!

145
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,934
Hold there!

146
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,857
As you wish.

147
00:25:25,184 --> 00:25:26,362
Is this land Dane?

148
00:25:26,496 --> 00:25:28,318
It is and you're not.

149
00:25:28,608 --> 00:25:33,277
So unless you're ready for a shower
of arrows you tell who you are!

150
00:25:33,408 --> 00:25:37,182
Two blows from this
and fifty men will be on this beach

151
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:39,134
before your next breath.

152
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:41,020
Fifty birds maybe.

153
00:25:42,464 --> 00:25:44,351
Is that then your word?

154
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:45,886
I'm Beowulf.

155
00:25:49,055 --> 00:25:50,365
Beowulf the Geat?

156
00:25:50,623 --> 00:25:51,736
Ahh, here we go.

157
00:25:52,352 --> 00:25:54,937
We come as friends for Hrothgar.

158
00:26:04,511 --> 00:26:06,300
Well we welcome friends.

159
00:26:07,551 --> 00:26:08,828
Bring what you need.

160
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:10,748
I'll have men look to your ship.

161
00:26:41,855 --> 00:26:43,416
Welcome to Daneland

162
00:26:54,783 --> 00:26:58,329
By Thor they have the spark of cows.

163
00:27:08,864 --> 00:27:10,108
Who's that?

164
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,468
Selma, a witch.

165
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,836
The happy would keep
a boat length from her

166
00:27:16,063 --> 00:27:17,274
Happiness isn't everything.

167
00:27:17,407 --> 00:27:19,262
She sees people's deaths.

168
00:27:35,455 --> 00:27:37,211
That is one beer hall.

169
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,646
If you like to drink with the ghosts.

170
00:27:42,656 --> 00:27:44,030
Beowulf!

171
00:27:47,775 --> 00:27:53,755
Oh my little Beowulf,
nobody tells me anything.

172
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:01,627
I somehow think of you as smaller

173
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,767
I was eight when I left.

174
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,840
Ahh you've grown. Ahh.

175
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:11,165
I'm sorry we didn't mean to wake you.

176
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:12,792
Wake me.

177
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:19,165
I'm a grief crippled king half drunk
in the middle of the afternoon,

178
00:28:19,296 --> 00:28:20,856
what's there to wake?

179
00:28:22,655 --> 00:28:24,990
By the gods it's good to see you.

180
00:28:25,952 --> 00:28:30,174
Hahh, hahh!

181
00:28:31,231 --> 00:28:33,752
Hah! Hah!

182
00:28:38,303 --> 00:28:39,830
You think you need a beer?

183
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,650
- Ah, ya.
- Aye.

184
00:29:11,871 --> 00:29:13,694
If Geat were seeking a wife,

185
00:29:14,016 --> 00:29:16,405
this room would hold better
up than most.

186
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:19,166
So many.

187
00:29:19,295 --> 00:29:20,408
Widows.

188
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:25,207
Widows far too early.

189
00:29:33,727 --> 00:29:36,247
Ho, ho.

190
00:29:47,616 --> 00:29:48,860
Ah...

191
00:30:18,336 --> 00:30:20,572
With my King I welcome you all.

192
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,388
We can never forget this gift.

193
00:30:47,392 --> 00:30:52,859
Hahh. Nannnnannnannnannnnanaaaan

194
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,474
From this night on
the only working flesh

195
00:30:56,607 --> 00:31:00,404
this troll feasts on will be it's own.

196
00:31:00,543 --> 00:31:02,583
Yae!

197
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,030
With the morning,
your curse will be less than a shadow.

198
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,753
Yas!

199
00:31:10,911 --> 00:31:14,108
Well maybe not less,

200
00:31:14,912 --> 00:31:20,313
but I mean to hold in my hand
the head that by my sword

201
00:31:20,447 --> 00:31:23,709
no more steers a dead troll body.

202
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,622
Yas!

203
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,305
We'll hoist the shield now

204
00:31:29,408 --> 00:31:36,860
Drive that hunger back down it's mouth.
Await, can chew on it's tongue.

205
00:31:37,183 --> 00:31:40,315
It can chew on it's own stinking stone
of a heart,

206
00:31:40,447 --> 00:31:42,040
...but no more Danes.

207
00:31:47,008 --> 00:31:48,950
We mean to put an end to this fiend.

208
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:50,680
Yas!

209
00:31:50,815 --> 00:31:51,993
As other's vowed

210
00:31:52,127 --> 00:31:53,305
Unferth!

211
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:57,077
By you will dear Queen.

212
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,953
We're wiser in knowing the hearts of
those who tangled with that thing.

213
00:32:01,088 --> 00:32:02,975
Those are dead.

214
00:32:07,231 --> 00:32:14,356
I don't brag of wrestling with it.
Nor of Being able to kill it.

215
00:32:15,071 --> 00:32:19,544
The troll broke down these doors with
twenty Danish warriors sleeping inside.

216
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,430
What gives thirteen Geats better hope?

217
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:28,511
We won't be sleeping.

218
00:32:31,647 --> 00:32:33,174
Unferth!

219
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,193
Sit!

220
00:32:38,047 --> 00:32:39,803
Or see your guts in a dish.

221
00:32:50,527 --> 00:32:58,394
Now before the dark will sharpen us -
play, drink.

222
00:33:04,416 --> 00:33:05,364
No.

223
00:33:13,344 --> 00:33:15,166
Since it began we'll have Swedes,

224
00:33:15,295 --> 00:33:18,644
Saxons even Sloths even coming
to see how weak we were.

225
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,495
Ya I know, I look like walrus shit.

226
00:33:27,327 --> 00:33:29,815
Comes from fighting things you can't.

227
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,229
All bad dreams end.

228
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,996
We'll see you in the morning
for herring and egg.

229
00:33:36,767 --> 00:33:38,393
Herring and egg?

230
00:33:40,863 --> 00:33:42,903
Now, if there's anything
you need to tell me about it,

231
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:45,341
now would be the time.

232
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:53,820
I'll stay here. Amongst you.

233
00:33:57,152 --> 00:34:01,941
We'll bring you the head -
throw it in with the herring and egg.

234
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:07,548
MMMMMMMMmmmm

235
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,095
Ahhhh, hahhahahhhaa

236
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:27,357
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

237
00:37:34,528 --> 00:37:36,219
Priest.

238
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:39,643
Where did you spend the night?

239
00:37:42,656 --> 00:37:45,023
Why was such a dark wretch spared?

240
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:46,613
That's not what he asked.

241
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,948
Wise king.
You must know of the name of Clovis

242
00:37:53,087 --> 00:37:53,589
The Frank?

243
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:56,117
The Frank, yes, yes, the Frank.

244
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,087
The Christian Sword over land ten times
what the Danes hold dear.

245
00:38:00,159 --> 00:38:00,988
He's dead.

246
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,224
Yes, ten years now.

247
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,661
...but not before he saw God's grace.

248
00:38:06,175 --> 00:38:10,332
The Visigoths of Aquitaine, the Romans
and the Syagrius, Burgundians,

249
00:38:10,463 --> 00:38:14,325
Alamans all fell before him
and all because he had God's ear.

250
00:38:14,463 --> 00:38:16,984
As I recall yours had a thousand swords.

251
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:20,797
Neighbors offered wine and pork
and no eyes at his ribs.

252
00:38:20,927 --> 00:38:22,421
And no fucking trolls!

253
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,382
And no fucking trolls!

254
00:38:25,056 --> 00:38:29,878
My skinny hand can only bless,
but trust me.

255
00:38:30,112 --> 00:38:36,670
This thing shall meet it's end
in striking me or those of mine.

256
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:42,558
Madness has it's wonders.

257
00:38:43,007 --> 00:38:45,789
The Celt sat straight in
the path of the thing.

258
00:38:46,335 --> 00:38:47,764
It was not touched.

259
00:38:48,255 --> 00:38:52,117
The Celt held no sword.
Perhaps the thing hates weapons.

260
00:38:52,255 --> 00:38:54,873
The old men were armed, true.

261
00:38:55,008 --> 00:38:57,244
Others here in arms have been spared.

262
00:38:57,888 --> 00:39:01,019
I have been waiting for Odin
to bring me my death.

263
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,487
He hasn't.

264
00:39:03,744 --> 00:39:05,118
In his wisdom?

265
00:40:02,143 --> 00:40:04,413
This is where the blood trails led.

266
00:40:08,992 --> 00:40:11,381
I tell you,
this troll must be one tough prick.

267
00:40:12,224 --> 00:40:14,558
Do this climb every night after supper?

268
00:40:40,416 --> 00:40:42,139
Why don't you blow your horn now,

269
00:40:42,368 --> 00:40:44,473
I wouldn't mind
those fifty bows bragged of.

270
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:47,477
I could bring the bows.
But the men are gone.

271
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,033
Thorfinn!

272
00:40:54,912 --> 00:40:55,894
Are you alright?

273
00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:57,977
- I'm fine.
- Good

274
00:41:04,352 --> 00:41:06,206
A little high up for driftwood.

275
00:41:06,976 --> 00:41:08,437
What are we fighting here?

276
00:41:08,575 --> 00:41:09,884
A Thing beyond our ken.

277
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,309
Could spread out...
meet back here in a year?

278
00:42:03,936 --> 00:42:05,692
We're out of our world.

279
00:42:58,848 --> 00:43:01,433
Padre, santi...

280
00:43:01,568 --> 00:43:06,935
Go in peace my son, go in peace.
Next!

281
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:29,337
I was off in a dream.

282
00:43:30,847 --> 00:43:32,789
Wish I could bring a better one.

283
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:45,845
Baptism they call it.

284
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:52,255
Unferth feels that he's fallen
from the grace of the gods.

285
00:43:58,432 --> 00:44:00,952
It's not every mars wish
to sit in blood.

286
00:44:01,279 --> 00:44:06,168
If this Christ can stiffen
Unferth's heart, what's the harm?

287
00:44:06,367 --> 00:44:08,538
They swim only out of fear.

288
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:14,491
But still... they swim.

289
00:44:57,151 --> 00:44:58,580
Dusk soon, eh.

290
00:44:58,879 --> 00:45:00,254
You a herd dog?

291
00:45:02,463 --> 00:45:04,438
I've been called worse.

292
00:45:05,632 --> 00:45:06,876
I'm Beowulf...

293
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:09,431
Yes. The much-told hero from Geatland.

294
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:18,808
So who are your people?

295
00:45:19,616 --> 00:45:23,129
None. I came here in my teens.

296
00:45:23,231 --> 00:45:25,784
A whore to Unferth's uncle,
Alvis Three-Legs.

297
00:45:28,704 --> 00:45:30,198
So you're not then Dane?

298
00:45:30,336 --> 00:45:33,881
Oh I am.
My family was killed by Wulfing raiders.

299
00:45:34,112 --> 00:45:38,552
Ah, my father too...
not killed, but...

300
00:45:39,807 --> 00:45:42,076
I mean, but a feud
with the Wulfings brought us here.

301
00:45:42,208 --> 00:45:44,030
I guess you werert made a whore.

302
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,498
I'm told you know of things to come.

303
00:45:49,632 --> 00:45:51,323
Hmm, that's a wide sea.

304
00:45:51,935 --> 00:45:53,146
Of deaths of things.

305
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:56,788
Seeing that everything living dies
you still give me the sight of gods.

306
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:01,335
Speak clean. You wonder of yourself.

307
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,749
More of the troll.

308
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:04,508
Not of yourself?

309
00:46:05,952 --> 00:46:07,774
In some things I'd rather be blind.

310
00:46:07,903 --> 00:46:10,522
You're worse than Loki
with your sheepshit twining.

311
00:46:11,487 --> 00:46:15,033
The death of the troll will cost dear
both the Geats and the Danes...

312
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:16,857
as it bloody well should.

313
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,293
Why as it should?

314
00:46:19,423 --> 00:46:24,213
The Danes have done their doom on him.
And you come here to kill.

315
00:46:24,544 --> 00:46:25,973
Day's going down.

316
00:46:26,208 --> 00:46:27,866
If we want to be ready...

317
00:46:32,863 --> 00:46:34,871
Careful with what you don't understand.

318
00:46:56,511 --> 00:47:01,083
Has this thing,
this troll killed any children...

319
00:47:02,015 --> 00:47:03,608
- No
- women?

320
00:47:05,503 --> 00:47:06,878
Old men?

321
00:47:08,448 --> 00:47:12,790
What are you saying?
It fights with a clean heart?

322
00:47:13,535 --> 00:47:17,594
It kills the strongest first.
It shows us and kills the strongest.

323
00:47:17,727 --> 00:47:19,516
Who cares if he spares the children?

324
00:47:19,647 --> 00:47:21,786
They'll die anyways
without their fathers.

325
00:47:22,752 --> 00:47:25,534
My wits still war
with how this all began

326
00:47:29,408 --> 00:47:32,506
It came for the mead hall...
I can only guess.

327
00:47:33,664 --> 00:47:36,533
The night we finished it,
before creep came,

328
00:47:36,671 --> 00:47:40,414
we hadrt seen a troll in
fifteen twenty years.

329
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,258
So nothing was done to the troll itself?

330
00:47:43,391 --> 00:47:43,926
Oh Beowulf!

331
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:45,886
It's a fucking troll!

332
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:49,373
Maybe someone looked at it
the wrong way!

333
00:47:51,423 --> 00:47:52,732
Some Dane?

334
00:47:56,192 --> 00:47:58,581
Who hands you this? Selma?

335
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:00,791
Come on.

336
00:48:00,927 --> 00:48:03,131
She's been out in the wilds too long.

337
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,477
Her head is full of spiders,
her lap is full of moss.

338
00:48:07,616 --> 00:48:08,761
It's said she sees things.

339
00:48:08,832 --> 00:48:11,068
Well the crazy do see things.

340
00:48:13,151 --> 00:48:16,894
I never begged anyone to come here
and take on our fight.

341
00:48:17,247 --> 00:48:18,808
I don't hold you here...

342
00:48:19,328 --> 00:48:19,894
I know you don't.

343
00:48:20,031 --> 00:48:21,558
Then don't saddle my heart
with the talk of

344
00:48:21,695 --> 00:48:24,892
why a fucking troll does
what fucking troll does.

345
00:48:55,839 --> 00:48:57,432
Ahhhhh!!!!!

346
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,422
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!

347
00:48:59,552 --> 00:49:01,177
Watch the sides!

348
00:49:09,408 --> 00:49:11,230
Cone on crab slime,

349
00:49:12,992 --> 00:49:14,846
show me these teeth.

350
00:49:56,063 --> 00:50:01,246
O'er the night, the warriors waited,
sword and shield in ring wrapped grasp.

351
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:05,980
Then the fiend of bog and brine reached
those doors of ten mers weight,

352
00:50:06,112 --> 00:50:12,571
...bade it creak by breath alone.
But then smelt God amongst the men.

353
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:16,183
Hardly had they hoisted steel,
this thing's rank guts gave out.

354
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,589
Great Beowulf, God's awful arm... -

355
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:23,150
Enough! Go on, go off kids.

356
00:50:23,474 --> 00:50:24,936
Go on, go off!!

357
00:50:29,586 --> 00:50:31,048
You scare them doing that.

358
00:50:31,219 --> 00:50:32,812
O fuck, Thorkel.

359
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,596
They've only had months of waking
to the scattered parts of kin!

360
00:50:35,730 --> 00:50:37,421
Don't feed them lies.

361
00:50:38,834 --> 00:50:42,763
That was piss the other night -
piss on us.

362
00:50:43,314 --> 00:50:46,380
If any gods were around there,
they were sleeping.

363
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:51,337
Celt says that Jesus Christ
never sleeps, that he walks amongst us.

364
00:50:51,731 --> 00:50:57,197
Oh, that's all we need.
A god gone mad from lack of sleep.

365
00:51:07,154 --> 00:51:08,463
Enough!

366
00:51:15,058 --> 00:51:16,651
He's already fighting like that Dane.

367
00:51:18,290 --> 00:51:23,025
You want to waste your strokes
on me and the air - go ahead.

368
00:51:26,995 --> 00:51:28,555
Hondscioh had a bad dream.

369
00:51:37,234 --> 00:51:38,641
And yours were good?

370
00:51:40,914 --> 00:51:43,369
Here with the smoke of the dead?

371
00:51:45,362 --> 00:51:47,566
I don't see fear helping us.

372
00:52:06,611 --> 00:52:07,855
Watch you don't drop that.

373
00:52:08,818 --> 00:52:10,444
Fear has it's place.

374
00:52:37,458 --> 00:52:39,346
I wondered if you threw the bones.

375
00:52:41,202 --> 00:52:43,374
I need the right path.

376
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,553
There is the one
that leads back to Geatland.

377
00:52:46,227 --> 00:52:47,754
If the bones say so.

378
00:52:50,994 --> 00:52:52,172
What if I lie?

379
00:52:55,827 --> 00:52:57,550
Then the gods will bring me back.

380
00:53:00,531 --> 00:53:02,473
So. No thoughts at all for my cunt.

381
00:53:06,131 --> 00:53:11,216
Warrior-monk huh,
there's not many of those.

382
00:54:28,818 --> 00:54:30,095
Troll!

383
00:54:30,322 --> 00:54:34,381
Leave here...
or stay and meet your doom!

384
00:54:34,514 --> 00:54:39,784
Doom... doom...
doom doom doom doom doom doom doom

385
00:54:39,922 --> 00:54:40,685
Is that talk?

386
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:42,859
It isn't barking

387
00:54:49,522 --> 00:54:50,154
What?

388
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,843
You're not Dane,
that's why you still breathe.

389
00:54:53,586 --> 00:54:56,172
I'm blood-bound to Hrothgar!

390
00:54:56,306 --> 00:55:00,332
Blood, blood, blood,
blood... owhhhhooohha

391
00:55:00,467 --> 00:55:02,060
He says that's your burden.

392
00:55:02,578 --> 00:55:03,626
My burden...

393
00:55:03,763 --> 00:55:06,348
...is your stinking life!

394
00:55:10,131 --> 00:55:11,592
Come down here,

395
00:55:11,666 --> 00:55:15,823
I swear I'll hammer these stones
right up your hairy arse!

396
00:55:15,954 --> 00:55:17,896
Garble

397
00:55:25,779 --> 00:55:27,437
Why won't he fight me?

398
00:55:28,019 --> 00:55:31,281
Why should he?
You've done nothing to him.

399
00:55:37,715 --> 00:55:39,689
What was he doing at your hut?

400
00:55:39,954 --> 00:55:44,558
I forgot. You're the great Geat -
welcome to women wherever you go.

401
00:55:44,914 --> 00:55:45,678
Swimmer of oceans...

402
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:48,079
able to kill five Swedes
with one stroke of his great blade...

403
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:51,244
We came to help the Danes find peace.

404
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:57,293
I'm Dane. I'm at peace.
Not that I always was.

405
00:55:57,715 --> 00:56:00,300
When Alvis Three-Legs died in my bed,
some claimed I killed him.

406
00:56:00,434 --> 00:56:03,020
So they drove me to the wilds.

407
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:05,838
Then they'd only come around to
maybe spill some seed.

408
00:56:07,090 --> 00:56:08,617
Not since Grendel.

409
00:56:09,682 --> 00:56:11,024
Grendel?

410
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:13,449
Your troll.

411
00:56:14,451 --> 00:56:19,023
Weirdly enough he has a name.
It means grinder.

412
00:56:20,594 --> 00:56:21,871
Of bones.

413
00:56:22,354 --> 00:56:24,689
No, of teeth.

414
00:56:25,363 --> 00:56:32,073
He was born with bad dreams.
Nothing I say will help you kill him.

415
00:56:48,978 --> 00:56:50,800
As long as the king wins the day.

416
00:56:50,931 --> 00:56:52,240
Always, my lord.

417
00:56:56,850 --> 00:57:02,000
Another bloodless dawn.
For you at any rate.

418
00:57:06,387 --> 00:57:07,631
I'm pissing it.

419
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:09,675
Blood?

420
00:57:11,283 --> 00:57:13,421
It's cone and gone over
the last few months.

421
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:18,571
I'm turning into a woman.
Or a dying man.

422
00:57:24,019 --> 00:57:28,209
I spoke with him last night. Grendel.

423
00:57:29,267 --> 00:57:30,379
You talked?

424
00:57:30,962 --> 00:57:33,613
If you can believe what Selma says.

425
00:57:34,323 --> 00:57:39,690
He was above me in the rocks.
But he spoke, words.

426
00:57:41,299 --> 00:57:44,146
He only wants Danes.
He blames you for something.

427
00:57:44,275 --> 00:57:45,518
Oh he blames me!

428
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:49,512
He blames me!

429
00:57:50,451 --> 00:57:52,273
Of all the shit he blames me!

430
00:57:53,619 --> 00:57:56,040
There's coves north of here
no Dane even dares to go!

431
00:57:56,178 --> 00:57:58,218
How much land does one mouth need?

432
00:57:58,387 --> 00:58:01,005
What does he think he is
some sort of fucking troll Caesar -

433
00:58:01,138 --> 00:58:03,277
with rights to everything he looks upon?

434
00:58:05,874 --> 00:58:13,327
Beowulf, the word
on the waves is I die happy.

435
00:58:14,739 --> 00:58:16,975
No gods I've ever know has
offered me that.

436
00:58:17,106 --> 00:58:19,725
They promised me beer,
fish here and there...

437
00:58:19,859 --> 00:58:21,419
and friends to burn.

438
00:58:27,635 --> 00:58:30,482
It's hard to hold you spoke
to that thing.

439
00:58:30,930 --> 00:58:32,621
From well beyond my sword.

440
00:58:37,235 --> 00:58:38,828
Something has you turning.

441
00:58:39,955 --> 00:58:42,442
I fear he just waits for us to go.

442
00:58:44,178 --> 00:58:46,283
Same thought gnaws on me.

443
00:59:02,035 --> 00:59:04,369
Now Celt bless me or be done.

444
00:59:10,546 --> 00:59:15,664
Go in peace my lord, go in peace.
Wise king go in peace.

445
00:59:19,411 --> 00:59:25,007
That's it my lord, praise the Lord.
Praise him.

446
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,289
Go with the thorn of Christ, wise King.

447
00:59:46,066 --> 00:59:48,554
Grimur's got a troll-heart!
He brought the troll here!

448
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:50,545
I'm a Dane and a Christian!

449
00:59:50,674 --> 00:59:52,136
And your mother screwed trolls!

450
00:59:52,371 --> 00:59:53,832
You little prick! You!

451
00:59:58,227 --> 00:59:59,885
The Troll killed my brothers.

452
01:00:01,203 --> 01:00:05,163
But this wretch didn't
but we'll get the one who did.

453
01:00:06,355 --> 01:00:09,072
Now on you go. All of you, go on!

454
01:00:12,754 --> 01:00:17,097
I can lead you to
the Dane-killer's cave.

455
01:00:23,250 --> 01:00:24,679
Why didn't you before?

456
01:00:24,755 --> 01:00:38,034
Ahh... I feared it's wrath, my death.
No more. No more.

457
01:00:50,163 --> 01:00:51,570
Over there.

458
01:01:21,426 --> 01:01:22,572
Great.

459
01:01:22,642 --> 01:01:24,049
So who jumps first?

460
01:01:24,306 --> 01:01:25,234
It'ss...

461
01:01:25,362 --> 01:01:27,467
a-a short climb down.

462
01:01:30,899 --> 01:01:32,687
Our scabby friend's right.

463
01:01:32,851 --> 01:01:34,225
I can see the hole.

464
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:35,465
Give us a hand.

465
01:02:00,210 --> 01:02:01,584
I-I swear - by

466
01:02:01,715 --> 01:02:02,642
Christ.

467
01:02:02,642 --> 01:02:04,366
Let's leave Christ out of this.

468
01:02:10,003 --> 01:02:11,180
We need a rope.

469
01:02:11,282 --> 01:02:14,544
- I'll rope ya.
- Might not be a bad idea.

470
01:02:15,859 --> 01:02:18,793
Hey troll - have some of ours!

471
01:02:51,698 --> 01:02:54,000
...so they came to
the cave of the killer.

472
01:02:54,867 --> 01:03:03,115
Wrecked by rush and slime of slope
Hondscioh fair fell to Valhalla

473
01:03:03,282 --> 01:03:05,224
Let's uh let this sad tale sleep.

474
01:03:05,906 --> 01:03:09,834
Hondscioh shows up -
great Odin asks how he died.

475
01:03:10,610 --> 01:03:11,723
He says -

476
01:03:11,891 --> 01:03:13,320
- I... fell?

477
01:03:22,386 --> 01:03:23,728
Breca!

478
01:03:23,827 --> 01:03:25,485
Breca!

479
01:03:48,306 --> 01:03:51,121
Even the trolls love my wonderful hair.

480
01:03:51,251 --> 01:03:52,876
I think he wanted you
for more than that.

481
01:03:53,011 --> 01:03:55,825
Great Breca, the Troll-house Pisser!

482
01:03:56,147 --> 01:03:58,864
I'd be more careful
where I wave my spear.

483
01:03:59,122 --> 01:04:01,359
I'd piss in his mouth
if he dared to show it.

484
01:04:02,482 --> 01:04:04,522
Best be ready to do more than that.

485
01:05:41,491 --> 01:05:42,800
Beowulf

486
01:06:03,283 --> 01:06:04,363
Look!

487
01:06:05,522 --> 01:06:08,937
Our friend Grendel doesn't come
from mist and shit alone.

488
01:06:12,371 --> 01:06:15,632
I curse you and all your kin.

489
01:06:59,602 --> 01:07:00,879
He wasrt in his cave.

490
01:07:02,066 --> 01:07:03,408
How does he die?

491
01:07:05,011 --> 01:07:06,734
Unless your teeth can catch an axe.

492
01:07:10,002 --> 01:07:12,206
I led my men into this... not knowing.

493
01:07:13,011 --> 01:07:14,985
If I'd known, I'd've come alone.

494
01:07:16,306 --> 01:07:18,128
Now I see doom hanging
over some of them.

495
01:07:18,259 --> 01:07:19,917
Doom I brought.

496
01:07:22,674 --> 01:07:23,918
You found the cave.

497
01:07:26,739 --> 01:07:28,265
That's where I see him dying.

498
01:07:28,946 --> 01:07:29,612
Would you wait in your cave

499
01:07:29,746 --> 01:07:31,851
and for killers who knew
the path to your door?

500
01:07:36,851 --> 01:07:38,095
Take me to Grendel.

501
01:07:38,579 --> 01:07:41,262
What, you think I can sniff him down?

502
01:07:41,586 --> 01:07:44,237
Maybe not, but he can sniff you.

503
01:08:01,203 --> 01:08:02,348
Which way up from here?

504
01:08:02,419 --> 01:08:03,979
Straight... but you'd need claws.

505
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:05,519
Then again, heroes... -

506
01:08:09,299 --> 01:08:10,924
You hit me, I'll be the one -

507
01:08:14,195 --> 01:08:15,471
One to what?

508
01:08:16,371 --> 01:08:21,389
I can't stop his death from coming...
nor can I hurry it.

509
01:08:22,450 --> 01:08:26,312
He needs to know...
I know he was wronged.

510
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:29,199
But if he doesn't leave here
I can't stop...

511
01:08:29,266 --> 01:08:30,989
You're warning him.

512
01:08:43,507 --> 01:08:47,730
Careful which side you end up on.
You're a long way from the village.

513
01:08:48,722 --> 01:08:50,380
You're a longer way from home.

514
01:10:45,298 --> 01:10:46,346
Wake up men,

515
01:10:46,483 --> 01:10:47,759
or never again!

516
01:11:03,091 --> 01:11:05,327
By Christ, demon, you shall die!

517
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,592
Pappa

518
01:14:10,482 --> 01:14:12,424
Now you truly know our loss.

519
01:14:16,178 --> 01:14:18,153
You only told us half the tale.

520
01:14:20,211 --> 01:14:22,578
The other half would dull your sword.

521
01:14:24,755 --> 01:14:29,359
That troll didn't give a shit about us,
not till we wronged him.

522
01:14:30,259 --> 01:14:33,968
He killed one, ah,
he could've killed more.

523
01:14:36,115 --> 01:14:38,122
He killed the one he held in blame.

524
01:14:39,474 --> 01:14:41,962
Were it so easy... l'd have been the one.

525
01:14:44,530 --> 01:14:46,091
I killed his father.

526
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:49,901
And even that might have been an end

527
01:14:50,130 --> 01:14:52,137
...had it only been the father there...

528
01:15:04,786 --> 01:15:05,866
None of the others saw the child.

529
01:15:06,002 --> 01:15:08,872
But I could've quelled it there
and then...

530
01:15:09,363 --> 01:15:10,956
but weakness stopped my sword.

531
01:15:17,010 --> 01:15:17,937
Or kindness.

532
01:15:18,067 --> 01:15:20,488
Well then
it's the hardest kindness I know.

533
01:15:21,010 --> 01:15:23,531
All the gods are running away
from me now -

534
01:15:24,115 --> 01:15:26,220
as though I were the death itself.

535
01:15:33,011 --> 01:15:37,353
What had the father done to you?
Why did you kill him?

536
01:15:39,346 --> 01:15:40,775
He crossed our path.

537
01:15:43,538 --> 01:15:44,967
Took a fish.

538
01:16:14,803 --> 01:16:15,980
Without an arm...

539
01:16:16,115 --> 01:16:17,456
Unless it grows back.

540
01:16:19,347 --> 01:16:20,591
He's a troll

541
01:16:24,882 --> 01:16:28,395
Tell me, Thorfinn. What is a troll?

542
01:16:28,947 --> 01:16:32,143
They say there are lizards
that can grow back limbs.

543
01:16:33,395 --> 01:16:36,177
They say there are worms
that can grow back heads.

544
01:16:37,970 --> 01:16:40,818
This thing's no more worm than you or I.

545
01:16:43,282 --> 01:16:46,894
Yahhhh!

546
01:16:47,027 --> 01:16:50,288
Yahhhh!

547
01:16:50,419 --> 01:16:55,405
Yahhhh!

548
01:16:58,834 --> 01:17:03,439
You know, I've put my thing in other
mers wives, other mers daughters...

549
01:17:03,570 --> 01:17:05,479
All can be forgiven

550
01:17:06,002 --> 01:17:07,464
I slept with a witch -

551
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:09,385
You slept with a witch?

552
01:17:11,283 --> 01:17:12,777
That's gotta be bad.

553
01:17:13,522 --> 01:17:16,010
I put my thing in her.
That was a while back... -

554
01:17:16,466 --> 01:17:18,441
So long as you vow to change your ways.

555
01:17:18,515 --> 01:17:23,370
Oh, y'know I'll try, right, but... ahhh.

556
01:17:26,195 --> 01:17:28,650
Ya! Ya!

557
01:17:33,298 --> 01:17:38,154
Ya! Ya! Ya!

558
01:17:40,339 --> 01:17:42,728
Where's the arm ring?
I wanted that arm-ring.

559
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:43,794
He didn't have an arm-ring.

560
01:17:43,923 --> 01:17:46,547
Sure he did.
Listen the creep near snapped my neck.

561
01:17:46,547 --> 01:17:48,685
Figured I'd at least get the arm-ring.

562
01:17:51,122 --> 01:17:52,332
To the end of gloom!

563
01:17:52,402 --> 01:17:54,225
To the end of Gloom!

564
01:17:55,091 --> 01:17:56,268
To the end of Gloom.

565
01:18:04,722 --> 01:18:06,577
I don't think I'm the worst king...

566
01:18:07,571 --> 01:18:08,585
Not at all... -

567
01:18:08,691 --> 01:18:10,152
...when I think of the others.

568
01:18:11,730 --> 01:18:15,378
Martin Longsword has got a long sword,
but no brains.

569
01:18:15,378 --> 01:18:17,418
Half his kin ran off to Angle-land.

570
01:18:17,906 --> 01:18:22,892
Six-tooth Peter the Slav can't keep
his warriors from fighting each other.

571
01:18:25,203 --> 01:18:26,544
Then... there's Sig!

572
01:18:27,250 --> 01:18:27,719
Sig?

573
01:18:27,858 --> 01:18:33,260
Sig Skullsplitter of the Hathboards.
Havert you heard of Sig?!

574
01:18:33,651 --> 01:18:36,717
I don't know... something... with sheep?

575
01:18:36,850 --> 01:18:40,941
Sheep! Good God, man!
Sheep are just the tip of it.

576
01:18:41,075 --> 01:18:43,213
They say he tried it once
with a dead walrus...

577
01:18:43,347 --> 01:18:45,932
he's tried horses... he's,
he's tried goats.

578
01:18:46,067 --> 01:18:49,133
They say he tried it once with a,
with a rabbit... and got stuck...

579
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:50,379
Stuck?!

580
01:18:50,642 --> 01:18:51,919
I tell ya, when he comes to a fight,

581
01:18:52,050 --> 01:18:55,083
he comes with six legs...
and you want to see fast?!

582
01:18:58,130 --> 01:18:59,789
If he ever comes here,

583
01:18:59,890 --> 01:19:01,930
I'll just send out
a batch of squirrels!

584
01:19:02,066 --> 01:19:03,528
That'll stop him!

585
01:19:21,747 --> 01:19:26,984
It's over now. It's over.
The troll's dead.

586
01:19:29,490 --> 01:19:30,832
Come on now dear.

587
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,328
Let's lie down a bit.

588
01:19:32,594 --> 01:19:34,634
There'll be many more nights now
to drink.

589
01:19:56,819 --> 01:19:58,958
Is this more or less as you saw it?

590
01:19:59,954 --> 01:20:01,164
With the troll?

591
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:04,586
I saw you more bloodied.

592
01:20:08,275 --> 01:20:09,769
Luck stood at my side.

593
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:12,942
Luck can be a whore too.

594
01:20:14,930 --> 01:20:16,239
Arert you missing the meal?

595
01:20:17,394 --> 01:20:19,118
Guess I miss my friend more.

596
01:20:20,786 --> 01:20:21,931
Hondscioh.

597
01:20:24,722 --> 01:20:28,879
And one Geat's life won'th - what?
Huh?

598
01:20:29,395 --> 01:20:34,926
Two Danes...? Three Swedes...?
Ten trolls...?

599
01:20:37,747 --> 01:20:40,911
Hondscioh's life had won'th to you,
since you knew him.

600
01:20:43,026 --> 01:20:44,968
Others know others.

601
01:20:49,811 --> 01:20:51,633
You mourn the troll.

602
01:20:53,682 --> 01:20:54,795
I knew him.

603
01:20:59,474 --> 01:21:02,157
One night Grendel found my hut.

604
01:22:41,267 --> 01:22:42,860
He never took me again.

605
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:51,056
So why did he keep coming back?

606
01:22:52,050 --> 01:22:53,676
Keep the Danes away.

607
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:58,701
The ones who'd fuck me
and then cut my throat.

608
01:23:22,162 --> 01:23:23,951
Where...
Where did that have it's birth.

609
01:23:24,082 --> 01:23:27,017
You thinking you can tie me up
and drag me like a dog.

610
01:23:29,075 --> 01:23:30,733
Don't forget.

611
01:23:33,234 --> 01:23:34,761
I know how you die.

612
01:23:46,834 --> 01:23:47,914
Been a while?

613
01:23:48,402 --> 01:23:51,217
With men... yeah.

614
01:24:16,659 --> 01:24:20,270
He slept with a witch.
Who sleeps with a witch?

615
01:24:21,138 --> 01:24:24,783
I'm tellnya, Christ y'thought
the Celts were work but these

616
01:24:24,914 --> 01:24:27,761
it's one hand on their sword,
the other on their dick...

617
01:24:27,891 --> 01:24:29,484
which hand they'll
use to cross themselves,

618
01:24:29,618 --> 01:24:31,407
I almost fear to ask...

619
01:25:02,354 --> 01:25:04,394
Learn from your child, hag!

620
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:59,368
Aeschere! Aeschere!

621
01:26:09,043 --> 01:26:10,188
It's Aeschere.

622
01:26:15,442 --> 01:26:19,566
Aeschere! We will right this wrong!

623
01:26:19,699 --> 01:26:22,448
God will burn this devil-bitch-fiend!

624
01:26:53,714 --> 01:26:55,274
Nothing lives here.

625
01:27:08,307 --> 01:27:11,787
Cave doesn't end here.
There's outflow from the other side

626
01:27:12,914 --> 01:27:14,092
I'll go.

627
01:27:15,794 --> 01:27:17,136
You can't swim for shit.

628
01:28:30,419 --> 01:28:32,840
Ahhhhhhh!!!!

629
01:28:34,482 --> 01:28:35,911
Ahhhhhhh!!!!

630
01:30:10,355 --> 01:30:11,599
Your father.

631
01:30:27,827 --> 01:30:29,321
Then be proud.

632
01:31:01,298 --> 01:31:04,080
Valkyries will have their hands full
with that old goat.

633
01:31:09,011 --> 01:31:10,767
I'm sorry to have brought you
to all this.

634
01:31:12,659 --> 01:31:14,001
We brought ourselves.

635
01:31:14,898 --> 01:31:16,305
At least it's over.

636
01:31:18,771 --> 01:31:25,710
The Celtic priest said I'd be forgiven.
I just need to hook the right god.

637
01:31:27,026 --> 01:31:30,801
You ever worry about that? Heaven?

638
01:31:33,523 --> 01:31:36,011
I'm thinking I'll likely go
where I'm sent.

639
01:32:13,331 --> 01:32:15,665
You know they'll kill your son
if they find him.

640
01:32:18,066 --> 01:32:19,244
You couldn't.

641
01:32:30,419 --> 01:32:31,848
I'm not them.

642
01:32:35,251 --> 01:32:39,528
No. You just killed his father.

643
01:32:44,690 --> 01:32:46,665
Hrothgar taught you nothing then.

644
01:33:44,691 --> 01:33:46,731
Sleep, Grendel.

645
01:34:16,402 --> 01:34:23,659
...born of scum and swampy things
lurking in his mother's moss

646
01:34:24,978 --> 01:34:33,773
the mark of Cain came to his brow,
of evil and a sea-hag born,

647
01:34:34,642 --> 01:34:40,720
Grendel, grinder of lost mers bones.
Felt hated toward the happy Danes.

648
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:43,087
Cain... what's that?

649
01:34:43,378 --> 01:34:46,248
Man who killed his brother
in a Christian tale.

650
01:34:46,387 --> 01:34:50,893
What's Cain got to do with Grendel?
Grendel kill his own brother too?

651
01:34:51,090 --> 01:34:55,978
No, I think Thorkel's saying
that Grendel's like Cain - a Killer.

652
01:34:56,114 --> 01:34:57,227
We all are.

653
01:34:57,299 --> 01:34:57,997
Ya, well

654
01:34:58,130 --> 01:34:59,789
Thorkel's tale is shit.

655
01:35:38,675 --> 01:35:43,115
- By Odirs will...
...let us find our way home.

656
