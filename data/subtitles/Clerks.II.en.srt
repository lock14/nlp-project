writing these long diatribes

to attack the handicapped?

What handicap?

183

The guy's
just in a wheelchair.

I'm talking about Anne Frank.

199
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,001
Anne Frank's

00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:44,333
Well, then, I guess
this guy is like Anne Frank,

your pooter.

Mr. Dante!

357
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:06,422
Leave Elias alone, Randal!

358
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,924
Don't look at his wee-wee.

359
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,026
Dude, the Transformers sucked.

360
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,259
Oh, no, they didn't.

361
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:15,664
They were more
than meets the eye.

362
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,929
<i>(scoffs)</i>

363
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,936
They could beat the pants
off Ranger Danger any day.

364
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:21,030
Yeah. I'll lose sleep wondering
whether you're right

365
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,506
- about that or not.
- Ow.

366
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,941
I thought you weren't even
allowed to watch a lot of TV

367
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:26,774
in your house 'cause you're all
Christian and shit.

368
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,076
Well, as it turns out,
cars and trucks

369
00:17:29,114 --> 00:17:30,877
that turn into...

370
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,943
robots aren't really
that blasphemous,

371
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,954
because my pastor says

372
00:17:37,022 --> 00:17:39,684
that machines can turn
into other machines,

373
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,455
and it's not a sleight
against God.

374
00:17:42,494 --> 00:17:44,189
Transformers were
a total sleight against God,

375
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,891
inasmuch as God sent
His only begotten son

376
00:17:46,932 --> 00:17:49,457
to die on the cross
to redeem mankind,

377
00:17:49,501 --> 00:17:50,695
and all we did to pay him back

378
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,864
was make terrible fucking
cartoons like the Transformers.

379
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,704
Nice shot.

380
00:17:56,742 --> 00:18:01,543
Well, 'cause at Bible camp,
we made this flow chart which...

381
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,877
I mean, I don't know,

382
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:06,043
kind of, like, proved
or whatever that...

383
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,177
Well, okay...

384
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:08,481
Bible camp?!

385
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,509
Since God created...

386
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,751
Since God created man,

387
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:16,090
and man created
the Transformers...

388
00:18:17,229 --> 00:18:20,221
..the Transformers are like
a gift from God, Randal.

389
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:23,063
No, sir.
They are not a gift from God.

390
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,297
They are an unholy curse

391
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:27,271
from the beast
we call the Desolate One.

392
00:18:27,306 --> 00:18:28,739
I don't really want
to hear this, Randal.

393
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,298
The first of the fallen,

394
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:31,673
the spoiler of virgins,

395
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,940
the master of abortions!

396
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,741
You know I don't like to talk
about dark forces, Randal.

What?

410

That wave.

411
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:21,655
I saw Becky, so I waved.

412
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,820
She'll be in here in 20 seconds.

413
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:24,829
And?

414
00:19:24,863 --> 00:19:25,921
And you've got to greet her

you fuckin' ass-kiss?

416

What's that all about?

417
00:19:29,301 --> 00:19:30,734
It's called friendship.

418
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:31,736
She's your boss.

419
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,101
You can't be friends
with your boss.

420
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,106
No, you can't be friends
with your boss.

421
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,437
I like my boss.

422
00:19:36,475 --> 00:19:38,443
I think there's
something going on

423
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:39,603
between you two.

424
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,612
You're crazy.

425
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,614
You spend an awful lot
of time talking to her.

426
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,946
I spend an awful lot of time
talking to you, too.

427
00:19:44,983 --> 00:19:46,109
And I've always maintained

428
00:19:46,151 --> 00:19:48,949
you're harboring an unrequited
homosexual crush on me.

429
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,147
We're just friends.

430
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,656
That's what I keep telling you.

431
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:53,658
No, you idiot, me and Becks.

432
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:55,159
"Becks"?

433
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,161
I knew it.

434
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,663
You're fucking
around with the boss.

435
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,155
Yeah, that's why I'm moving
to Florida with my fiancee.

436
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,327
Why would you want
to fuck around

437
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,960
with a chick your own age, man?

438
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,971
If you've got to sow
some of your wild oats,

439
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,666
there's all
these fine young chicks

440
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,402
that stop in here after school.

441
00:20:10,442 --> 00:20:13,934
First off, I'm not cheating
on my fiancee.

442
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:16,539
Secondly, if I was cheating
on my fiancee,

443
00:20:16,582 --> 00:20:18,482
it wouldn't be with a teenager.

444
00:20:18,517 --> 00:20:19,541
Why not?

445
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,950
The best part of this job

446
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:23,454
is all the barely-legal pussy
that comes in here.

447
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:24,853
And they all look up to me,

448
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,619
'cause I've got
a driver's license.

449
00:20:26,658 --> 00:20:29,320
It's awesome.
You're 33.

450
00:20:29,361 --> 00:20:31,158
You show me one
33-year-old chick

451
00:20:31,196 --> 00:20:32,595
who's as buck-wild in bed

452
00:20:32,631 --> 00:20:34,360
as her 17-year-old
counterpart.

453
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,162
17-year-olds
nowadays are crazy.

454
00:20:36,201 --> 00:20:37,600
They're up for anything.

455
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,934
They even like it when
you go ass to mouth.

456
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:43,265
Oh... my... God.

457
00:20:43,308 --> 00:20:44,275
What?

458
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:45,401
Are you serious?

459
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:47,810
I don't fuck around when
it comes to ass to mouth.

460
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:49,336
DANTE:
You never go ass to mouth.

461
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:50,712
It's never my idea.

462
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,740
These young girls today
get all horned up,

463
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,581
and they tell you
to go ass to mouth.

464
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,110
You never go
ass to mouth, Randal!

465
00:20:56,154 --> 00:20:57,451
You sound like my mom.

466
00:20:57,489 --> 00:20:58,979
Becks, do you ever
go ass to mouth?

467
00:20:59,024 --> 00:21:00,457
You never go ass to mouth.

468
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:02,153
You've never gone ass to mouth?

469
00:21:02,194 --> 00:21:03,627
You never go ass to mouth.

470
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:05,186
I've never gone ass to mouth.

471
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,424
Not even once?

472
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,864
Not even ever.

473
00:21:07,899 --> 00:21:09,230
You're both so repressed.

474
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,326
All right, look,

475
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:12,360
I know you've given
a blow job, right?

476
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,372
I haven't even put
my purse down yet.

477
00:21:14,406 --> 00:21:15,532
That's a yes.

478
00:21:15,574 --> 00:21:17,735
And I know you've
gone down on chicks.

479
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,073
What's your point?

480
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,100
Well,

481
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:22,306
when you're done chowing down
on the no-no parts

482
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,905
of your lover,
you kiss him, right?

483
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,576
That's just like going
ass to mouth.

484
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,609
Okay, I'm pretty sure you just
compared a vagina to an asshole.

Shut the fuck up, GoBot.

492
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,004
I could probably sue
this whole corporation right now

493

494
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:52,503
You're just making me
restock the napkin holders

495

beliefs

496

497
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,709
You never go ass to mouth!

but sometimes,
in the heat of the moment,

502
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,963
it's forgivable
to go ass to mouth.

So you did.

527

That's her parents's house,

Yes, but only until the wedding.

her parents
are giving us a house.

00:24:02,808 --> 00:24:03,900
Oh, yeah.

534
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,933
Her dad sweetened the pot
with two fatted calves

<i>and a goat.

536
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:10,947
I'm gonna miss you, Hicks.

537
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:12,949
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.

538
00:24:12,984 --> 00:24:14,076
I still can't believe

539
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:16,713
you're just gonna leave
me alone in this place...

540
00:24:16,755 --> 00:24:18,484
with Randal Graves,
of all people.

541
00:24:18,523 --> 00:24:19,615
Quit.

542
00:24:19,658 --> 00:24:20,716
Move to Florida.

543
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,420
You could work
at the car wash with me.

544
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,725
Wow, you make it
sound so tempting.

545
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,594
How can I say no?

546
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,725
Oh, yeah... 'cause it's a
fucking car wash in Florida.

547
00:24:29,768 --> 00:24:31,429
Like it's any worse
than this place.

548
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,495
Hurl the insults
all you want, buddy man.

549
00:24:33,538 --> 00:24:35,506
As soon as my uncle's
on his feet again,

550
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,531
it's not like I'm
gonna be staying here.

551
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,510
- Hey, how's he doing?
- A lot better.

552
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:41,603
It only took two years
and a shitload of chemo,

553
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,978
but... his red cell count's
almost back to normal.

554
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,242
That's great.

555
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:46,750
Yeah, it's great for me, too.

556
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,548
Couple of weeks
in this crap shack

557
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:51,283
turned into a couple of
years a little too quickly.

558
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,790
But, Hicks, we can sit here

559
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:54,917
making small talk
about your last day

560
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:57,258
and what it is I'm going
to do once you're gone,

561
00:24:57,295 --> 00:25:02,028
or we can treat this
like any other workday.

562
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,329

And you wonder why no chick'll
let you stick your cock in her.

567
00:25:24,389 --> 00:25:26,516
I never wondered that.

568
00:25:26,558 --> 00:25:27,957
Yeah, 'cause you've accepted
the fact

569
00:25:27,993 --> 00:25:29,961
that you'll never get a chick
a long time ago.

570
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,495
I could get a chick if I wanted.

571
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,963
<i>(laughs):
Who are you kidding?</i>

572
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:34,625
You can't get a chick, you mook.

573
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,065
You're too weird and sad.

574
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,670
I turn down chicks
left and right.

575
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,699
<i>Your chicks are

576
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:48,809
Yeah, right.
What do you know?

577
00:25:48,847 --> 00:25:50,781
Uh, I know
you're a huge fuckin' nerd

578

582
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,951
Yeah. The kind of chicks

and elves and shit,

584
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:05,159

585
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:06,925

was a bunch of people walking.

629

Three movies of people walking
to a fuckin' volcano.

641

even the Academy recognized

642
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,492
when they gave Peter Jackson
the Best Directing Oscar...

643
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:24,024
an award your little friend
George "Toy Boy" Lucas has never

644

Let me tell you something.

00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,938
If Peter Jackson
really wanted to blow me away

649
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:34,911
with those "Rings" movies,
he would've ended the third one

650

651
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,848
not the 25 endings
that followed.

652
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,350
What's the logical
closure point?

enlighten us.

655
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,787
When fucking Frito wakes up from
his little coma or whatever,

656
00:28:45,824 --> 00:28:48,554
and the little hobbits are
jumping up and down on his bed,

657
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,060
and Sam leans in the doorway

658
00:28:50,095 --> 00:28:51,960

that very fuckin' gay look.

shut your fuckin' mouth.

664
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,006
That look was so gay,
I thought Sam was gonna tell

665
00:29:03,041 --> 00:29:04,633
the little hobbits
to take a walk

666
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,268
so he could saunter
over to Frodo

667
00:29:06,311 --> 00:29:07,608
and suck his fuckin' cock.

668
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,273
<i>Now, that would've been
an Academy Award-worthy ending.</i>

669

Hey, faggot, they're not gay.
They're hobbits.

670
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:16,545
And then right after
the Sam-Frodo suckfest,

671
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,385
right before the credits roll,

672
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,051

him anymore, don't you?

I can't wait until
you get engaged,

00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:41,799
I'm not saying that
it's not all right for you,

708
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,000
but, yes, I do think

709
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:45,441
that marriage goes
against our primal nature.

710
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:46,602
To be loved?

711
00:30:46,644 --> 00:30:49,238
To fuck as much as possible...

712
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:53,011
spread the seed around
and keep the species going.

713
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:55,144
And all that shit
they feed us in the movies

714
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,813
and greeting cards
is just propaganda

715
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,449
to get us to marry, have kids
and keep the economy going.

716
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,958
Marriage is just
the keystone to economics.

717
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,391
You're such a sappy girl.

718
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,521
- Mm.
- Are you trying to tell me

719
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:07,292
you don't believe in love,
Beckalah?

720
00:31:07,332 --> 00:31:08,629
In romantic love,

721
00:31:08,666 --> 00:31:09,928
no.

722
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:12,095
Like, I love my parents.

723
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:14,730
I love my car.
I love you.

724
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:17,400
But romantic love,
hearts and flowers,

725
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,240
"There's only one person
out there for me"?

726
00:31:20,278 --> 00:31:22,974
Come on, you know how many
people there are out there?

727
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,413
Odds are there's always going

728
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:26,440
to be someone who's
a better match for you

729
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:28,179
than the person
you end up marrying.

730
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,379
So based on your theory,

731
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,820
there's someone out there
better for me than Emma.

732
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:34,689
Oh, no,
I'm not touching that one.

733
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,159
Wait a second.

734
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,889
You don't think
I really love her?

735
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:40,090
<i>(sighs):
I think...</i>

736
00:31:40,131 --> 00:31:42,292
you love what she represents.

737
00:31:42,333 --> 00:31:43,732
Which is?

738
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,963
Come on, Dante, she was
the girl who wouldn't give you

739
00:31:46,004 --> 00:31:47,494
the time of day
back in high school.

740
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,403
And years later,
after she's played the field

741
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,170
and realized how unsatisfying
the so-called "hotties" are,

742
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,371
she's finally gone
with someone who looks...

743
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:55,674
Oh, my God,

744
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:57,476
you're gonna say
"fugly," aren't you?

745
00:31:57,515 --> 00:31:58,573
Unconventional!

746
00:31:58,616 --> 00:31:59,844
Ah, nice backpedal.

747
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,579
<i>Thank you.
(laughs)</i>

748
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,280
It took her a few years

749
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,618
to finally figure out
that thing

750
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:06,715
that every mother tries
to teach their little girl

751
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,089
but she has to learn on her own,

752
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:10,458
and that's that guys
that look like you

753
00:32:10,495 --> 00:32:12,520
have a lot more to offer,
because you'll always

754
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:14,087
try harder than the pretty boy.

755
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:16,896
What am I, some hideous
fucking CHUD over here?

756
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,870
<i>(laughs):
No, you're a catch... kind of.</i>

757
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:22,270
And Emma's a catch, too.

758
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:24,298
'Cause not only
is she pretty, but...

759
00:32:24,342 --> 00:32:26,867
she'll make all your decisions
for you.

760
00:32:26,911 --> 00:32:29,744
Which is lucky,
because you're pretty terrible

761
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,646
at making decisions.

762
00:32:31,683 --> 00:32:33,617
So my last day
is all about you telling me

763
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:35,380
what an ugly,
indecisive loser I am?

764
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,512
<i>(laughs)</i>

765
00:32:36,554 --> 00:32:38,385
Come on, you worked
at Quick Stop

766
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:39,981
for, like, a decade,

767
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:43,289
and you've been here
for a year almost,

768
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:45,853
and since day one at both jobs,

769
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,592
all you've ever said
is how you needed

770
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,997
to get out
and start your life.

771
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,262
And it wasn't until Emma walked
through the door and was,

772
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,894
like, "Come down
to Florida with me,

773
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:54,268
"and I'll fuck your brains out,

774
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:56,535
and my daddy will give you
a job, and blah-blah,"

775
00:32:56,574 --> 00:32:58,735
that you actually went
and did something about it.

776
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:00,175
And I get it... it's...

777
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:03,237
she's your golden ticket, dude.

778
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,714
So, uh...

779
00:33:05,683 --> 00:33:07,150
..what's that make you?

780
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:13,851
I'm just the girl who fucks
ugly, indecisive losers

781
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,689
in the kitchen
once this place is closed.

782
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:18,954
<i>(whispers):
That's me.</i>

783
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,553
<i>(laughing)</i>

784
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:27,535
DJ: That's something
for the lovers out there.

785
00:33:27,572 --> 00:33:29,699
J- RAM Radio.
Right around high noon...

786
00:33:29,741 --> 00:33:33,040
So, we're never gonna talk
about it, are we?

787
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:37,773
What is there to say?

788
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:39,680
Do you regret it?

789
00:33:39,717 --> 00:33:41,446
Do you?

790
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:44,455
I regret that it was
on the prep station table.

791
00:33:44,489 --> 00:33:46,252
Yeah, you regret it...
you weren't the one

792
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,518
who got mayo in your cooch.

793
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,254
<i>(both laughing)</i>

794
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,328
What do you want me to say?

795
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,361
We were drunk, you know?

796
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,306
It just kind of happened.

797
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,639
You're just lucky

798
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,236
I'm not one of those monogamists
like your girlfriend.

799
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:11,442
Otherwise, I might try
to make you stay in Jersey.

800
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,712
If anyone could do it,
it'd be you.

801
00:34:23,528 --> 00:34:26,429
Dude, your old lady's out here
looking for you.

802
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:27,556
<i>(door creaks)</i>

803
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:32,563
<i>(whispers):
Yeah.</i>

804
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:40,801
Come outside with me.
I've got a surprise for you.

805
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:53,714
That's my surprise?

806
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,282
No.

807
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,892
# Goodbye, horses... #

808
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:07,632
Hey.

809
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,597
Oh.

810
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,700
So, um...

811
00:35:12,743 --> 00:35:15,337
are you looking for
a good Transformers site?

812
00:35:15,379 --> 00:35:18,405
Because at CarsToBots. Com,

813
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,213
you can get an avatar

814
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:25,416
that's your picture
morphed to look like a robot.

815
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:26,923
Come on, man.

816
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,687
You know I only surf
Transformers sites

817
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:32,127
when there's girls around,
so they can see how cool I am.

818
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:36,266
So what are you doing then?

819
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:39,736
Trying to secure a going away
present for Mr. Dante.

820
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:40,862
Really?

821
00:35:40,905 --> 00:35:44,397
Well, how about
an Arwen sword replica?

822
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:46,307
What?

823
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:49,108
Uh...

824
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,139
'Cause it's, like,
thoughtful and practical.

825
00:35:52,183 --> 00:35:56,984
I was thinking of something
a little more sexy.

826
00:35:57,021 --> 00:36:01,117
Well, what's sexier than
an elf princess's sword?

827
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,922
A donkey show.

828
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,018
What's that?

829
00:36:04,061 --> 00:36:06,495
You ever see a chick
give a mule a blow job?

830
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:08,260
<i>(screeching):
Oh, no!</i>

831
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,358
Shh!

832
00:36:10,401 --> 00:36:11,766
Jesus!

833
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:14,202
If you spoil this,
I'm gonna brain you.

834
00:36:14,238 --> 00:36:16,229
You gonna keep your mouth shut?

835
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:17,935
<i>(muffled):
Yes.</i>

836
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:18,941
God.

837
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,205
That's bestiality, Randal.

838
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,304
At its finest, I hope.

839
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,315
Who'd want to see
something like that?

840
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,817
Me, Dante, you.

841
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,444
I don't want to see
something like that.

842
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:31,352
Why would you want to see
something like that?

843
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:32,947
Because it's fucked up.

844
00:36:32,990 --> 00:36:34,150
And I want to see

845
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,752
if a chick with a mouthful
of donkey spunk swallows.

846
00:36:36,794 --> 00:36:38,159
All right, here we go.

847
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:40,596
"Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud.

848
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:43,122
"Straight from
their dirty debut in Tijuana,

849
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,067
"Kelly's taking it on the road.

850
00:36:45,102 --> 00:36:47,570
Taking it in the ass, that is."

851
00:36:47,605 --> 00:36:50,768
You got to give it up for Oscar
Wilde-like wordplay that good.

852
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:52,435
Do they show pictures?

853
00:36:52,476 --> 00:36:55,309
Only one of Kinky Kelly
sucking off Optimus Prime.

854
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:56,313
Really?

855
00:36:56,347 --> 00:36:57,939
Ow.

856
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,449
Let me borrow your cell phone.

857
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:00,472
Whoa.

858
00:37:00,518 --> 00:37:02,418
Well, 'cause, I'm only
supposed to use it

859
00:37:02,453 --> 00:37:04,546
to call my parents
in case of an emergency.

860
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:05,715
This is an emergency.

861
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:07,587
We got to lock up
Kinky Kelly for tonight,

862
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:10,526
so we can give Mr. Dante
a memorable send-off.

863
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,359
You love Mr. Dante, don't you?

864
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,659
In a non-gay way.

865
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,098
Then give me your phone.

866
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:18,226
'Cause Mr. Dante's never
seen a donkey show.

867
00:37:18,269 --> 00:37:20,760
And it'd be nice to give
him this before he goes off

868
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,103
to Florida and gets married and
does all those other things

869
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,630
that prevent a guy
from ever seeing

870
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:26,472
a fucked-up donkey
show in his lifetime.

871
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:27,841
Hello.

872
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:30,938
Uh, I was hoping to schedule
Kinky Kelly for a performance.

873
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:32,913
Tonight.

874
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:34,577
Okay.

875
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:36,246
I'm on hold.

876
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:39,313
Fingers crossed.

877
00:37:39,357 --> 00:37:42,758
We should probably
cross dicks, too.

878
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:43,760
No.

879
00:37:43,794 --> 00:37:45,785
BECKY:
Work, work, work.

880
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:47,559
That's all you ever
think about, Hicks.

881
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:48,428
Hey, Becks.

882
00:37:48,466 --> 00:37:50,195
Hey, Emma.

883
00:37:51,702 --> 00:37:53,329
Great shirt.

884
00:37:53,371 --> 00:37:54,804
Isn't it?
I love it.

885
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:57,137
What I love even more are these.

886
00:37:57,174 --> 00:37:58,163
These came in early,

887
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,370
and I just had to come back
and show Dante.

888
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,242
And give you yours, of course.

889
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,680
And I have one
for Randal, I guess.

890
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,444
What is it?

891
00:38:06,484 --> 00:38:07,883
Look, I know it's
three months away,

892
00:38:07,918 --> 00:38:10,751
but it would mean so much to us
if you could make the trip down.

893
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:13,256
Well... yeah.

894
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,059
Uh, I wouldn't miss it.

895
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:18,357
I thought we were waiting
till we got down there

896
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,693
before we picked a date.

897
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,595
Oh, him is so cute.

898
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,031
Him thinking again, huh?

899
00:38:24,368 --> 00:38:26,063
If we left anything
up to these jackals,

900
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:27,798
nothing would ever
get done, would it?

901
00:38:29,106 --> 00:38:31,097
I'm just teasing.

902
00:38:35,746 --> 00:38:38,214
Guess you got to make their
decisions for 'em sometimes.

903
00:38:45,856 --> 00:38:46,914
All right, I've got it.

904
00:38:46,957 --> 00:38:47,946
I will see you then.

905
00:38:48,025 --> 00:38:49,549
Thank you.

906
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:51,390
My friend, tonight,

907
00:38:51,429 --> 00:38:53,954
we bring a bit of TJ
to the Jersey 'burbs.

908
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,329
<i>(door moos electronically)</i>

909
00:38:55,366 --> 00:38:56,924
Well, I don't know
about this, Randal.

910
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,958
I mean, how do we know
this isn't a hoax?

911
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:00,935
Like, were there any
pictures on the Web site?

912
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,404
Strangely, no.

913
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,000
But if you've seen pics of
one chick sucking off a donkey,

914
00:39:05,042 --> 00:39:07,203
you've seen them all.

915
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,905
Well, what if you
haven't ever seen pics

916
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:10,675
of anything like that?

917
00:39:10,715 --> 00:39:12,910
Well, then you must be
as blind as Anne Frank.

918
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:15,145
'Cause what's the point in
having an Internet connection

919
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,620
if you're not using it to look
at weird, fucked-up pictures

920
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,646
of dirty sex
you'll never have yourself?

921
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:29,925
Ho-ly shit.

922
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,595
You know, I've never pieced
this together until right now.

923
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,104
You're a virgin, aren't you?

924
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:36,936
You know I have
a girlfriend, Randal.

925
00:39:36,974 --> 00:39:37,872
Oh, yeah.

926
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,102
What's her name again?

927
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:41,111
Myra Hodgkiss.

928
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,908
You made her up, didn't you?

929
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:44,642
That name sounds so made-up.

930
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:47,150
No.

931
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:49,516
Seriously, Elias, have you
and Myra had sex yet?

932
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:51,919
Well, that's just
kind of personal, Randal.

933
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:52,945
Come on!

934
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:55,424
I tell you about
my sex life all the time.

935
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:56,756
I let you smell my fingers

936
00:39:56,794 --> 00:39:58,455
after I fucked
Taton Weathers' kid sister

937
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,123
in the office
that one time, didn't I?

938
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,724
You kind of made me
smell your fingers.

939
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:06,628
Maybe you just
don't like the pussy.

940
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:08,467
Maybe you're all about the cock.

941
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,736
No, no, I like the pussy.

942
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:11,867
So come on.

943
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,275
Did Myra ever give you a crack
at her crack or what?

944
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:17,109
Well, not that it's any
of your business, Randal,

945
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,308
but she can't.

946
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,816
Why?

947
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:23,517
Jesus, Elias, come on.

948
00:40:23,554 --> 00:40:25,522
You got to start
trusting me more.

949
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,080
Because once Dante's gone,

950
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,716
you're gonna be
my new best friend.

951
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:32,622
No, I'm not.

952
00:40:32,663 --> 00:40:34,824
Who the fuck else
am I gonna hang out with?

953
00:40:34,865 --> 00:40:36,389
It's gonna be you and me, buddy.

954
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,423
So come on.

955
00:40:37,468 --> 00:40:38,628
You got to start
trusting me more.

956
00:40:38,669 --> 00:40:40,864
Open up and tell me shit.

957
00:40:41,872 --> 00:40:44,602
Like why haven't you
fucked Myra yet?

958
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,200
<i>(sighs)</i>

959
00:40:47,878 --> 00:40:51,609
Well, we can't
because of Pillow Pants.

960
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:53,674
What the fuck's Pillow Pants?

961
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:57,813
Pillow Pants is a little troll
who lives in her pussy.

962
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:09,693
Pillow Pants is her pussy troll.

963
00:41:09,733 --> 00:41:11,200
Duh.

964
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:15,866
You know
how every girl's parents

965
00:41:15,906 --> 00:41:20,400
put a pussy troll in them
when the girls are young

966
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:23,436
to keep them from having
premarital sex?

967
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,848
Sure.

968
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:30,251
Well, Myra's is named
Pillow Pants.

969
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:34,986
And so, even though she totally
wants to have sex with me,

970
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:39,758
Myra says if I put
my thing in her,

971
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,992
Pillow Pants will bite it off.

972
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:47,495
So I got to wait
until Pillow Pants

973
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:51,440
gets peed out of her body
on her 21st birthday

974
00:41:51,475 --> 00:41:54,376
before we can have sex.

975
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:57,005
And Myra told you this?

976
00:41:57,047 --> 00:41:58,105
Boyfriends and girlfriends

977
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,708
talk to each other
about sex stuff, Randal.

978
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,844
You'd know this
if you ever had a girlfriend.

979
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,947
Have you and Myra
even kissed yet?

980
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:09,457
We would have already,
if it wasn't for Lister Fiend.

981
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:13,963
Lister Fiend is her mouth troll,
isn't it?

982
00:42:14,064 --> 00:42:15,929
Women.

983
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,131
I'll be right back.

984
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,969
You are never gonna believe
what Elias just told me.

985
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:28,102
Look who it is, Randal.

986
00:42:29,046 --> 00:42:31,071
Randal Graves.

987
00:42:31,115 --> 00:42:32,605
You work here, too?

988
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,744
Jesus. Anyone else from
our graduating class back there?

989
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:36,753
RANDAL:
Well, well, well...

990
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:38,914
Pickle Fucker.

991
00:42:38,956 --> 00:42:41,083
Man, look at you two
fun-ployees.

992
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,422
Nothing's changed.

993
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:44,450
You know, I'll bet
dollars to donuts,

994
00:42:44,495 --> 00:42:45,689
when you two aren't fighting

995
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,493
about who shot first,
Han or Greedo,

996
00:42:48,532 --> 00:42:50,523
you can still muster up
enough energy

997
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,798
to make fun of other people.

998
00:42:52,836 --> 00:42:54,997
Yeah. So hurry up and order
and get out of here,

999
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:56,766
so we can make fun of you.

1000
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,638
Oh, I don't know
if you're in a position

1001
00:42:58,676 --> 00:43:00,644
to make fun of anyone
anymore, Graves.

1002
00:43:00,678 --> 00:43:03,408
32 and you're
flipping burgers?

1003
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:05,438
Before that, I'd heard
it was the Quick Stop

1004
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,541
for, what, like, ten years?

1005
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,782
We can't all be
Internet millionaires.

1006
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,283
Who's an Internet millionaire?

1007
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,155
Elias, this is Lance Dowds.

1008
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:16,523
We went to high school together.

1009
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,857
A few years ago,

1010
00:43:17,895 --> 00:43:20,329
he built a search engine which
compiles the lowest prices

1011
00:43:20,364 --> 00:43:22,924
of merchandise
you can buy online.

1012
00:43:22,967 --> 00:43:25,401
You might have heard of it...
MadDucketts. Com.

1013
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,700
Didn't that just sell to Amazon
for, like, 20 million bucks?

1014
00:43:27,738 --> 00:43:29,228
RANDAL:
Yeah, but back before

1015
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:32,265
he was the Mad Ducketts guy,
he was just Pickle Fucker.

1016
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,674
You see, freshman year,

1017
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,770
the seniors would hunt us
down and put us through

1018
00:43:35,813 --> 00:43:37,440
what they called initiations.

1019
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:38,778
They'd stuff us into lockers

1020
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:40,841
or throw us in the girls'
shower room naked.

1021
00:43:40,884 --> 00:43:42,681
But Lance here
got the worst of it.

1022
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,745
The seniors yanked
down his pants,

1023
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:46,312
and shoved a pickle up his ass,

1024
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,688
and made him walk ten feet.

1025
00:43:47,725 --> 00:43:50,717
The pickle fell out
before he hit the ten-foot mark.

1026
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:55,926
He had to take a bite of it,
reinsert it and walk again.

1027
00:43:55,966 --> 00:43:57,331
Ew...

1028
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:59,563
Yeah, but don't worry...
he made it.

1029
00:43:59,603 --> 00:44:01,798
His pickle was small enough
to stay wedged

1030
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:03,397
after only four bites.

1031
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,271
I'll bet you're the only guy
in the world

1032
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,936
who still remembers that,
Graves.

1033
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,774
Oh, I bet you still remember it
pretty vividly...

1034
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,780
Pickle Fucker.

1035
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:12,042
ELIAS:
Do you have any interest

1036
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,312
in building
the ultimate fan site

1037
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:17,718
<i>for both The Lord of the Rings
and The Transformers?</i>

1038
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:19,780
Because I'd moderate it
for free.

1039
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,886
Ease up, Pillow Pants.

1040
00:44:21,925 --> 00:44:24,621
The dude's not into
your D&D, GoBots bullshit.

1041
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,686
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1042
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:26,696
Don't insult the guy.

1043
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,722
The GoBots are like
the Kmart of Transformers.

1044
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:32,327
Thank you!

1045
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:35,638
I keep telling them that.

1046
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,470
Here, here's my e-mail address.

1047
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,534
Drop me a line
with some of your ideas.

1048
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:41,566
Cool.

1049
00:44:47,985 --> 00:44:49,976
LANCE:
Okay, let's see.

1050
00:44:50,087 --> 00:44:52,180
What do I want?

1051
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:56,181
Uh... how about a Skinny Calf
with cheese and a Diet Coke?

1052
00:44:56,226 --> 00:44:58,922
I'll get your order.

1053
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:06,026
Here you go.

1054
00:45:07,171 --> 00:45:08,399
Well, that was fast.

1055
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:09,838
And fresh.

1056
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,864
Thanks. Come again.

1057
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,935
Yo, let's wrap this up
so I can get my Cow Tipper on.

1058
00:45:15,012 --> 00:45:16,172
You know what?

1059
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,202
Take mine.

1060
00:45:18,515 --> 00:45:20,483
Something tells me
I'm not gonna like it, am I?

1061
00:45:22,119 --> 00:45:23,677
Wow, thanks, Pickle Fucker.

1062
00:45:24,922 --> 00:45:27,220
Yo, so Pickle Fucker
gave us free eats!

1063
00:45:27,257 --> 00:45:29,282
You know,
I don't eat fast food.

1064
00:45:29,326 --> 00:45:30,657
It's not good for you.

1065
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:34,596
But when I heard you guys
were actually working here,

1066
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,792
well, I just had
to see it for myself.

1067
00:45:36,834 --> 00:45:39,632
It's kind of nice
having that kind of free time.

1068
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,138
Just like it's
kind of comforting to know

1069
00:45:42,172 --> 00:45:45,335
that some things never change.

1070
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:51,947
Take care, clerks.

You're supposed to be working.

1078
00:46:04,762 --> 00:46:06,923
I got to get out of here
for a few minutes.

DANTE: Here's what I
don't understand about you.

1106
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:56,105
You have a license, you
can drive a grown-up car.

1107
00:47:56,139 --> 00:47:57,572
But when you ride the go-carts,

1108
00:47:57,608 --> 00:47:59,838
you somehow feel
better about yourself.

1109
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,902
Look, it just centers me,
all right?

1110
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:04,470
Kind of the way jerking off
at work centers you.

1111
00:48:04,514 --> 00:48:06,744
I only did it that one time.

1112
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:08,114
And it wasn't to center me.

1113
00:48:08,151 --> 00:48:09,778
Yeah, it was to come.

1114
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,288
Well, I don't know about you,
but coming centers me.

1115
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,789
Then why did we
have to leave work,

1116
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,689
so we can ride the go-carts
to clear your head?

1117
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,921
Well, I don't want to jerk off
in the Mooby's bathroom.

1118
00:48:17,995 --> 00:48:19,360
What if a customer comes in

1119
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:22,490
and my jerking off gets him
all sex nuts and retard strong?

1120
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:23,624
Suddenly, I'm fighting him off

1121
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:25,692
as he tries to jam
my dick in his mouth.

1122
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,636
The most likeliest of scenarios.

must have really bothered you.

Oh, fuck him.

1126
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:34,944
He's an asshole.
He always was.

1127
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,912
I'm sorry I let him bug me
even for a second.

1128
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,144
At least I got a go-cart trip
out of it.

1129
00:48:43,186 --> 00:48:44,676
Why do the go-carts help?

1130
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,279
I don't know.

1131
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:48,951
They just remind me
of a better time in my life.

1132
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,960
Like when?

1133
00:48:51,061 --> 00:48:54,155
Like when we were young and the
world was still in front of us.

1134
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,721
We're not that old.

1135
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:56,858
Yeah.

1136
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:58,231
But sometimes I get the feeling

1137
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,998
the world kind of left us behind
a long time ago.

1138
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,005
You know...

1139
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,530
you can do something about that.

1140
00:49:04,574 --> 00:49:07,873
I told you, I don't want to jerk
off in the bathroom at work.

1141
00:49:07,911 --> 00:49:10,778
No, I mean you can
get out of Mooby's, too,

1142
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,839
completely change
your situation in life.

1143
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,683
What'd be the point? Besides,
why do you give a shit?

1144
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,744

- Randal!

00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,217
Of course.
Um, you know what?

00:51:46,570 --> 00:51:47,537
It ain't worth it.

1227
00:51:47,571 --> 00:51:48,595
You're lucky my husband doesn't

1228
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:50,970
jump across this counter
and knock your teeth in.

1229
00:51:51,007 --> 00:51:53,305
- Why?
- Yeah, baby, why?

1230
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:54,867
I mean, ain't like
he called us porch monkeys.

1231
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:55,935
Hey, hey!

1232
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:56,809
Baby, stop hitting on me!

1233
00:51:56,847 --> 00:51:58,007
See, the judge told you
about that.

1234
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,571
You got to stop
putting your hands on people.

1235
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,140
Here, take this.
This is your money.

1236
00:52:01,184 --> 00:52:02,446
Please, take the food on us.

1237
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,453
- We're sorry.
- Oh, uh-uh.

1238
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:04,545
I'm gonna write
to the paper about this,

1239
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:06,078
and all y'all getting
fired up in here.

1240
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:07,215
Jesus!

1241
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:08,485
I'm gonna take the food.

1242
00:52:08,525 --> 00:52:11,358
Thank you very much.

1243
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:15,060
Damn!

1244
00:52:15,098 --> 00:52:16,065
Fuckin' porch monkey...

1245
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:17,726
Thanks. Come again.

1246
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,564
Don't leave me, baby!

1247
00:52:19,603 --> 00:52:21,332
Are you out of
your fucking mind?!

1248
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:22,702
What?! What's the big deal?

1249
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:25,207
Since when is it a crime
to say "porch monkey"?

1250
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:27,073
Oh, I don't know...
since forever!

1251
00:52:27,110 --> 00:52:28,634
- Why?
- Because "porch monkey"

1252
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,509
is a racial slur
against black people.

1253
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,640
No, it's not. "Nigger" is.

1254
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:33,706
Randal!

1255
00:52:33,750 --> 00:52:36,082
Did Randal just call
Mr. Dante a nigger?

1256
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,416
Shut up, Elias!

1257
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:39,718
I didn't just call
Dante a nigger.

1258
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,088
I just said that "nigger"
is a racial slur.

1259
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,422
So is "porch monkey"!

1260
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:44,893
Oh, it is not.

1261
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:48,625
Coon, spook, spade,
moolie, jiggaboo, nignug...

1262
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:49,723
<i>those are racial slurs.</i>

1263
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:50,994
"Porch monkey" is not.

1264
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,831
I am going to pretend
like this conversation

1265
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:54,336
didn't happen.

1266
00:52:54,371 --> 00:52:55,736
Elias, go pick up
that fucking mess,

1267
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,364
and you are this close
to getting shit-canned!

1268
00:52:57,407 --> 00:52:58,669
<i>(scoffs)</i>

1269
00:52:58,708 --> 00:53:00,733
Fuckin' shoot me now.

1270
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:02,506
<i>(grunts angrily)</i>

1271
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:03,740
What are you doing?!

1272
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,145
Are you trying to get fired?

1273
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,379
Since when did "porch monkey"
suddenly become a racial slur?

1274
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,909
When ignorant racists started
saying it 100 years ago.

1275
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:12,148
Oh, bullshit.

1276
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,680
My grandmother used to call me
a porch monkey all the time

1277
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:16,692
when I was a kid,
because I'd sit on the porch

1278
00:53:16,726 --> 00:53:17,784
and stare at my neighbors.

1279
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:18,794
DANTE:
Despite the fact

1280
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,523
that your grandmother
might have used it

1281
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:21,963
as a term
of endearment for you,

1282
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:23,522
it's still a racial slur.

1283
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,967
It'd be like your grandmother
calling you a little kike.

1284
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:26,968
Oh, it is not.

1285
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,196
Plus, my grandmother had

1286
00:53:28,238 --> 00:53:30,968
nothing but the utmost respect
for the Jewish community.

1287
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,702
When I was a kid,
she told me to always treat

1288
00:53:32,742 --> 00:53:35,677
the Jewish kids well, or they'd
put the sheeny curse on me.

1289
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,373
What the fuck, man?!

1290
00:53:37,414 --> 00:53:38,176
What?!

1291
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,876
"Sheeny" is a racial slur, too!

1292
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:40,940
Oh, it is not.

1293
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:42,212
Yes, it is!

1294
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:43,981
Well, she never called
any Jews sheeny.

1295
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:45,816
She just used to say
"sheeny curse" a lot.

1296
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:46,822
<i>(chuckling):
It was cute.</i>

1297
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,915
It wasn't cute! It was racist!

1298
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:49,983
I disagree, man.

1299
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,219
She was just an old-timer.

1300
00:53:51,261 --> 00:53:52,990
That's the way people talked
back then.

1301
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,894
Didn't mean they were racists.

1302
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,992
But my grandmother did refer
to a broken beer bottle once

1303
00:53:59,102 --> 00:54:00,399
as a nigger knife.

1304
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,399
You know, come to think of it,

1305
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,271
my grandmother was
kind of a racist.

1306
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:06,502
You think?!

1307
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:08,067
Well, I-I still don't think

1308
00:54:08,111 --> 00:54:10,409
"porch monkey" should be
considered a racial term.

1309
00:54:10,447 --> 00:54:12,677
I mean, I've always used it
to describe lazy people,

1310
00:54:12,716 --> 00:54:13,944
not lazy black people.

1311
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,281
I think if we really tried,

1312
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:17,548
we could reclaim "porch monkey"
and save it.

1313
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,849
DANTE:
It can't be saved, Randal.

1314
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:20,515
The sole purpose
for its creation,

1315
00:54:20,557 --> 00:54:22,388
the only reason it exists
in the first place,

1316
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,359
is to disparage an entire race.

1317
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:25,691
And even if it could be saved,

1318
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:27,822
you can't save it,
because you're not black!

1319
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:29,354
Well, listen to you.

1320
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:32,562
Telling me I can't do something
because of the color of my skin?

1321
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:33,967
You're the racist.

Hey.

1335
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:32,823
So, are you scared
about getting married at all?

1336
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:37,255
Um...

1337
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:39,894
were we in the middle
of a conversation

1338
00:55:39,936 --> 00:55:41,096
I don't remember leaving?

1339
00:55:41,137 --> 00:55:44,573
I was just thinking about it,
and I was thinking

1340
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:47,075
that maybe you were waiting
for some friend

1341
00:55:47,110 --> 00:55:48,099
to try and stop you

1342
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:49,543
from going through
with the wedding

1343
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:52,275
by asking if you're even ready
to go and get married.

1344
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:54,283
So I'm asking.

1345
00:55:54,317 --> 00:55:56,080
Are you scared
about getting married?

1346
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,950
Well, kind of.

1347
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,319
I mean, I'm not scared
of getting married, you know...

1348
00:56:00,357 --> 00:56:02,791
I- I always wanted
to get married one day...

1349
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:05,260
but I am scared
of the wedding.

1350
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:07,286
Why?

1351
00:56:08,998 --> 00:56:11,228
I don't know how to dance.

1352
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,164
You're kidding.

1353
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,501
I wish I was.

1354
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,597
You're about to tie
your life to someone,

1355
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:18,732
someone who doesn't
even really get you

1356
00:56:18,775 --> 00:56:19,833
as well as your friends do,

1357
00:56:19,876 --> 00:56:23,107
and what you're sweating
is dancing at your reception?

1358
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,273
Well, I-I figure
she'll eventually get me.

1359
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,112
I mean, you're married
to someone long enough,

1360
00:56:27,150 --> 00:56:28,583
they got to get you
eventually, right?

1361
00:56:28,618 --> 00:56:29,585
Are you kidding?

1362
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:32,611
My parents have been married
for 35 years,

1363
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,282
and they still don't get
each other.

1364
00:56:34,324 --> 00:56:38,454
Emma's pretty,
smart, happy, a good person...

1365
00:56:38,495 --> 00:56:40,963
and for some strange reason,
she loves me.

1366
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:41,964
I mean, what am
I supposed to do,

1367
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,124
pass up on that because I have

1368
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,656
a few stupid doubts
and some jitters?

1369
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,602
Besides, dancing
at the reception's

1370
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:48,626
the more imperative concern
at this point,

1371
00:56:48,671 --> 00:56:49,797
because I only get,

1372
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,740
well, presumably, one chance
to dance at my wedding.

1373
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:55,478
<i>(sighs)</i>

1374
00:56:55,512 --> 00:56:57,173
So, what, you can't slow dance?

1375
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:59,773
No. Anybody can slow dance,

1376
00:56:59,816 --> 00:57:02,182
but this is one of the only
times I've ever gonna meet

1377
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:04,186
most of Emma's extended family,

1378
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:06,017
and I'd like to be able
to show some flair

1379
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:07,488
on the dance floor, you know?

1380
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,459
Like, make an impression
so that maybe they'll see

1381
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:12,017
whatever it is
that Emma sees in me

1382
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:15,121
instead of all feeling like
I'm some burger-peddling loser

1383
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,462
who couldn't even bust a move.

1384
00:57:18,468 --> 00:57:20,265
What?

1385
00:57:20,303 --> 00:57:22,464

Up here, jackass.

1391
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:49,193
What the fuck are you doing
up there?!

1392
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:50,290
Yo, if you're gonna jump,

1393
00:57:50,333 --> 00:57:52,198
let me get a crack
at that pussy first.

1394
00:57:52,235 --> 00:57:53,634
Let me find out.

1395
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,900
You still got your boom box?

1396
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:00,910
Play something,
and turn it way up.

1397
00:58:01,911 --> 00:58:05,142
Something danceable.

1918
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:29,553
Shit, I'm not
even in my twenties anymore.

1919
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:31,388
I don't want to sit around
and rag on customers

1920
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:32,552
while eating free food.

1921
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:33,754
That's what you want to do.

1922
01:20:33,795 --> 01:20:35,695
That's what you've
always wanted to do.

1923
01:20:35,730 --> 01:20:37,891
Well, if that's all you want out
of life, man, then God bless,

1924
01:20:37,933 --> 01:20:40,766
but I refuse to let your shit
taint the rest of mine.

1925
01:20:40,802 --> 01:20:43,896
No. I'm gonna smooth
things over with Emma,

1926
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:45,304
go to Florida

1927
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,400
and start
my Randal Graves-free existence.

1928
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:54,579
And try to forget these last
33 years ever happened.

1929
01:21:00,555 --> 01:21:03,854
So that's the way you see all
this time we've spent together?

1930
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:07,957
That's weird, man.

1931
01:21:08,063 --> 01:21:09,963
I thought you were
the only guy in the world

1932
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:11,930
who got me and had my back...

1933
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:14,959
the only person
who'd take a bullet for me,

1934
01:21:15,070 --> 01:21:16,537
'cause I assumed
you felt about me

1935
01:21:16,571 --> 01:21:19,404
the same way I feel about you.

1936
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:21,909
Then, all of a sudden, one day,
you're like, "I'm moving. Bye."

1937
01:21:21,943 --> 01:21:25,071
Do you know
what that's been like for me?

1938
01:21:26,314 --> 01:21:27,975
I'm looking at a future
that just sucks,

1939
01:21:28,083 --> 01:21:29,983
because you're
not gonna be in it anymore.

1940
01:21:30,085 --> 01:21:31,552
And you're not
even throwing me over

1941
01:21:31,586 --> 01:21:33,383
for a life
that means something to you.

1942
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:35,389
It's just a stupid,
hollow existence

1943
01:21:35,423 --> 01:21:36,390
you think you should embrace

1944
01:21:36,424 --> 01:21:37,789
because you're getting old
or something,

1945
01:21:37,826 --> 01:21:42,889
because it's the kind of life
everyone else goes after.

1946
01:21:42,931 --> 01:21:45,559
You're a fucking drone, dude.

1947
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,567
DANTE:
Fine.

1948
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:48,228
Then the next friend
whose life you ruin

1949
01:21:48,270 --> 01:21:50,170
can be a totally free spirit.

1950
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,297
How's that?

1951
01:21:51,339 --> 01:21:55,002
You think I want to start
making friends at my age?

1952
01:21:55,043 --> 01:21:57,011
Christ.

1953
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,036
Who would want me
as their friend?

1954
01:22:00,215 --> 01:22:03,707
I hate everyone, and everything
seems stupid to me...

1955
01:22:06,421 --> 01:22:09,356
..but you were always
the counterbalance to that...

1956
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:13,691
the guy who was the yin
to my yang.

1957
01:22:13,728 --> 01:22:17,220
But now what the fuck am I gonna
do for the rest of my life?

1958
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,497
I mean, shit, I really wish

1959
01:22:21,536 --> 01:22:22,969
you would've told me this
when I first met you

1960
01:22:23,038 --> 01:22:24,335
that one day,
you were gonna bail

1961
01:22:24,372 --> 01:22:25,669
on our friendship,

1962
01:22:25,707 --> 01:22:27,675
because if I had known
you were just gonna flake on me

1963
01:22:27,709 --> 01:22:31,338
a few decades later...

1964
01:22:31,379 --> 01:22:32,971
I wouldn't have even bothered
with your ass

1965
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:35,278
in the first place.

1966
01:22:38,019 --> 01:22:39,179
Jesus, why don't you two

1967
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,381
just fuck and get it
over with already?

1968
01:22:43,325 --> 01:22:44,451
<i>(muttering):
Faggots.</i>

1969
01:22:44,492 --> 01:22:48,326
Why can't you ever say
something useful for a change?

1970
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:50,626
Well, what the fuck
you waiting for?

1971
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:52,997
That's your cue, man.

1972
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,339
I got nothing.

1973
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:08,477
Jesus fucking Christ,
what good are you,

1974
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:09,642
you mute fuck?!

1975
01:23:09,684 --> 01:23:11,174
You know what?
That hurts.

1976
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:13,744
Like, what do you ever add
to the fucking proceedings?

1977
01:23:13,788 --> 01:23:16,586
You got, like, one answer
for everything: "Pussy, man."

1978
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:19,149
Oh, then, man, you must love
this fuckin' guy,

1979
01:23:19,194 --> 01:23:21,128
'cause he's the biggest pussy
I ever met.

1980
01:23:21,162 --> 01:23:22,652
The dude who lives his life

1981
01:23:22,697 --> 01:23:23,925
according
to everyone else's standards.

1982
01:23:23,965 --> 01:23:25,762
"I got to go to Florida

1983
01:23:25,800 --> 01:23:28,166
and get married, 'cause that's
what's expected of me."

1984
01:23:28,203 --> 01:23:30,831
And the fuckin' insane part is,
he ain't even that crazy

1985
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:33,136
about the chick he's marrying
or Florida,

1986
01:23:33,174 --> 01:23:34,334
never mind the fact
that he's got

1987
01:23:34,376 --> 01:23:35,343
a perfectly good chick

1988
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,971
right here in Jersey
who he's nuts about,

1989
01:23:38,046 --> 01:23:41,174
and even Anne fuckin' Frank
could see she's nuts about him.

1990
01:23:41,216 --> 01:23:42,843
God knows why.

1991
01:23:42,884 --> 01:23:44,977
And she likes you
for who you are, man.

1992
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:46,850
She ain't trying
to stuff you into a box

1993
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:48,355
you'll never fit into.

1994
01:23:48,390 --> 01:23:49,948
Not to mention the fact
that she's carrying

1995
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:51,652
your hideous fucking CHUD
of a kid.

1996
01:23:52,961 --> 01:23:54,451
Jesus, if you had any sense
whatsoever,

1997
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,793
you'd fuckin' stop trying

1998
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,457
to bray it up
with the rest of the sheep

1999
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:00,297
and live your life
the way it makes sense for you,

2000
01:24:00,335 --> 01:24:01,700
you fuckin' ass!

2001
01:24:01,736 --> 01:24:03,704
Oh, yeah?
And what's that?

2002
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:04,932
You obviously have
such a great handle

2003
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:06,302
on your life.

2004
01:24:06,341 --> 01:24:07,933
Tell me what you would do
if you were in my position...

2005
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:10,273
or even what you'd do
in your own position?

2006
01:24:10,311 --> 01:24:12,802
Swing that judgmental pendulum
back the other way

2007
01:24:12,847 --> 01:24:14,610
and tell me how you'd solve
all your problems, asshole.

2008
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:16,708
What the fuck would the
great Randal Graves do

2009
01:24:16,751 --> 01:24:18,150
if he were half the
master of his destiny

2010
01:24:18,186 --> 01:24:19,619
that I'm supposed to be?!

2011
01:24:19,654 --> 01:24:23,818
I'd buy the Quick Stop
and reopen it myself!

2012
01:24:25,727 --> 01:24:27,627
That's what I'd do.

2013
01:24:27,662 --> 01:24:30,256
That's what we should do.

2014
01:24:31,299 --> 01:24:32,766
Yeah, right.

2015
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:35,463
Who-who are we, Lance Dowds?

2016
01:24:35,503 --> 01:24:37,266
Do you know
how much it would cost

2017
01:24:37,305 --> 01:24:38,272
to buy the Quick Stop?

2018
01:24:38,306 --> 01:24:39,967
Like, 50 grand, easy.

2019
01:24:40,041 --> 01:24:43,533
And neither one of us have
that type of money.

2020
01:24:48,883 --> 01:24:50,578
<i>(sighs)</i>

2021
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,109
JAY:
We do.

2022
01:24:57,492 --> 01:24:59,722
That's right.

2023
01:25:00,962 --> 01:25:03,430
You guys would be willing
to lend us some of that money

2024
01:25:03,465 --> 01:25:04,989
so we can reopen the stores?

2025
01:25:08,303 --> 01:25:10,931
Sure, on two conditions.

2026
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:13,099
One: We can hang out
in front of the store

2027
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:14,904
anytime we want, and
you can't call the cops.

2028
01:25:16,144 --> 01:25:17,941
And two:

2029
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:19,775
You have to blow each other,

2030
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:20,803
and we get to watch.

2031
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:24,308
Then you have
to go ass to mouth.

2032
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,656
All right, just
the first condition.

2033
01:25:31,693 --> 01:25:32,921
Seriously?

2034
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:33,928
Do I stutter?

2035
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,930
Yeah, seriously.

2036
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:42,331
What do you think?

2037
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:43,837
<i>(sighs)</i>

2038
01:25:43,872 --> 01:25:46,841
I almost hate to say it, but...

2039
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:48,843
it kind of makes sense.

2040
01:25:50,011 --> 01:25:52,980
Hey, maybe that's why we spent
so much time in that store,

2041
01:25:53,014 --> 01:25:54,481
why college

2042
01:25:54,516 --> 01:25:56,984
or anything else
never panned out for us.

2043
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:58,575
I mean, think about it, man.

2044
01:25:58,620 --> 01:26:00,110
You and me running
our own business

2045
01:26:00,155 --> 01:26:02,817
instead of working
for some other asshole?

2046
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:06,417
Could be
pretty fuckin' sweet, right?

2047
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:10,820
Yeah, it really could.

2048
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,695
But I don't know, man.

2049
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:21,004
I was this close
to starting a new life.

2050
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:23,305
Jesus.

2051
01:26:25,046 --> 01:26:27,708
You're actually gonna make me
do this, aren't you?

for a minute, please?

how to dance at a wedding.

don't believe in romantic love.
