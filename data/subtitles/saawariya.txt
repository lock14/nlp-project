Woven from my dreams...
...this town isn't one
to be pinned onto a map...
...as it exists entirely
in my thoughts.
This is my town's most
magnificent bar...
...RK Bar.
Whenever business is good...
...I come here
to have a good imported drink.
It feels good.
Me, myself Gulabji.
You won't find anyone quite like me.
One who trades in false romance,
but tells stories of true love.
The tale I am about to tell you
isn't of an ordinary man...
...but of an angeI.
Torn jeans, guitar in hand...
...a rock-star angeI.
I met him for the first time
in this bar.
Like always, I was the last
customer that night.
Get me another whiskey.
And a glass of milk, please.
Who's this, asking for milk in a bar?
I'm the new lead singer here.
I'm practicing for my show tomorrow.
But this is no place for lullabies.
Here, we need
something sensationaI...
...something that stirs the body.
Songs should stir the souI,
not the body.
A souI that can't even be seen.
Just like a matchstick
that holds fire...
...unless it's lit, it can't be seen.
Or like the intoxication of alcohoI
that can't be seen.
Well said!
You have a way with words.
I have a way with songs too.
Hear one.
Just a few lines, go on.
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Set you in a palanquin
Decorate it with stars
Steal you away from this world
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Set you in a palanquin
Decorate it with stars
Steal you from this world
Steal away your heart
Excuse me, you think I'll be a star?
- More likely a superstar.
- Thanks.
He was wonderfuI,
straight out of a girI's dream.
Since then,
his song became his identity...
...Saawariya.
For days his voice
echoed in my mind.
Each time I thought of him, I smiled.
One evening I sat at my usual spot
counting my day's earnings.
Darn, I lost count.
Hey! Whose ball is this?
It's mine.
Hi. Good evening.
You see, I don't have a pillow,
so I'm using the ball.
The problem is
it keeps rolling away.
Sorry, I'll just pick it up.
Oh, Jesus, aren't you...?
- Aren't you the hero from RK Bar?
- Yes.
I thought you looked familiar.
But why are you sleeping
on the street?
What else can I do?
A new town, a new job,
and no one I know.
I can't turn up on anyone's doorstep.
No one would trust a stranger.
In short, you have no place to stay.
Correct.
You've come to the right place.
I live up there.
Do you want to give it a try, partner?
Thank you, maybe some other time.
I likes you.
You're the first person
to say no to Gulabji.
You are gorgeous...
...and cute guys like you
don't sleep on the street.
Lilian, that old hag,
lives across the street.
If she likes you,
she'll take you as a paying guest...
...but if she doesn't, you're toast.
Try your luck tomorrow morning.
Thank you.
But this is the red-light district.
Will you be able to live here
with these women?
Why not?
Aren't they someone's mothers,
sisters and daughters too?
But never anyone's wife.
But they could be someone's friend.
What do you say?
Do you want to give it a try, partner?
You want to be friends? Fine.
It hurts me to hear that little girI cry.
I don't likes.
It is the same story every day.
Her mother's at work
and won't be back all night.
Ours is a tough profession
and we'll never get any respite.
We've spent our entire
childhood crying...
...all night without a mother...
...waiting for some fairy to appear.
Neither a fairy appeared...
...nor did anyone ever
come to comfort us.
Go back to sleep.
One day an angel will arrive
Never is she ever going back
Her soft tiptoe rings in my ears
Day and night
Every moment
I long for her so bad
One day an angel will arrive
Befriends with flowers
Softer than the buds
The moment I look at her
She will be a bundle of shyness
Delicately, shyly
Nervously, coyly
With cloudy tresses
With terrified lips
She's going to astound me
As she arrives
One day an angel will arrive
She is never going back
Her soft tiptoe rings in my ears
Day and night, every moment
I long for her so bad
Wearing the veil of love
Adorning the henna of your dreams
Gazing deep in your eyes
Sweeping the distances away
She will sing songs of your love
As she arrives
One day an angel will arrive
Lilianji.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Who's me?
I heard that you have
a room for rent.
But who's me?
Ranbir Raj.
But you can call me Raj.
Why, did you get drunk
and gamble away your father's name?
I don't gamble, and I swear
I don't touch alcohoI.
Do you have any references?
None. Actually, I'm new to this town.
Sorry, I don't give out a room
without a reference. Get out.
These loafers, they just walk up to this
thinking it's a cheap hoteI.
It's a very proper guesthouse.
Wasting my time.
Here I was painting my nails.
I do have a reference!
What did you say?
I do have a reference,
if you don't mind.
Who?
- You.
- Me?
Look, Lilianji, no matter what
someone says about me...
...praises or condemns me...
...ultimately it's you
who has to decide.
My reference is your heart,
your judgment. Will that do?
Do you do any work
or just talk incessantly?
As far as work is concerned,
it is mostly music for me.
Your piano isn't tuned.
How many keys does a piano have?
Eighty-eight.
- How many strings on a violin?
- Four.
Add one from the heart, and it's five.
What deposit will you pay?
- I'll be the deposit.
- And rent?
UntiI I afford the rent,
I'll do all the chores you want me to.
Besides music,
do you do any other work?
Sure, I do. I dream, I write.
I spread joy when there's sorrow.
And if the need arises,
I do manuaI labor too.
Sometimes, I can even get by
with bread and water.
By the way, C sharp has a problem,
if you let me-
Just absolutely spoiI my temper.
And the room?
If I give you the room, I will also
end up eating only bread like you!
Sticking to me like a leech.
Can I ask you a question?
What?
When was the last time you smiled?
What do you mean?
When did you last call
someone your own?
The last time you loved someone?
The last time you hugged someone?
I hugged him.
Vincent, my son.
I begged him not to join the army...
...but he went anyway.
Thirty-seven years he's been away.
You've been alone for 37 years...
...never smiled, spoken with love,
or even hugged anyone.
Even if you don't give me a room,
there's something I want to give you.
What do you want to give me?
I just want to hug you, Lilipop.
You rascaI. He used to
call me Lilipop too.
Do you want to hug me?
You need to be hugged, Lilipop.
That night, Lilian found a son...
...the off-key piano finally
found the right key...
...and women like us,
we found a true friend.
We could call him our own...
...but for him, there was no one.
If there was anything,
it was simply destiny...
...that eventually favored him
one night.
Hello.
Madam, it's not raining,
why is your umbrella...?
Oh, you're crying?
Look here, madam, please don't cry.
I feeI terrible when someone cries.
You can leave your umbrella open
if you like, no problem.
Raj, you're so stupid.
Sorry, madam, I-
Hello?
Hello?
Where did she disappear?
Madam!
Madam, are you all right?
Do you need any help?
No, I don't.
Please stop following me.
Following you?
No way, I'm just trying to help you.
Damn, what's this world coming to?
If you need me,
I'm right here by this cafe.
Okay?
You are a still moonlight
Some delicacy or some angel
You are captivating
You are enchanting
Or some god's gift
Gosh, so beautiful
Gosh, so beautiful
Gosh, so beautiful
You are a still moonlight
Some delicacy or some angel
You are captivating
You are enchanting
Or some god's gift
Gosh, so beautiful
Gosh, so beautiful
Gosh, so beautiful
You are shyness
You are happiness
You are faith
You are intoxication
Silent eyes, like a plea
Your speech, like a prayer
You are present everywhere
Yet still remain so far away
Gosh, so beautiful
Gosh, so beautiful
Gosh, so beautiful
Excuse me. Can I drop you home?
Look, I don't even know you.
Listen, I don't know you either,
but I feeI it's my duty to drop you.
Who knows what could happen?
Don't take the trouble, I'll manage.
It's no trouble.
It would be my honor to drop you.
No, thank you.
Listen!
Hope you didn't think
I'm one of those drunkards?
Yes, that did cross my mind, when
you were staring at me on the bridge.
No, no. Don't get me wrong.
- Looking at you I simply thought-
- Thought what?
What did you think?
That I'm one of those women
that get out at night to...
No, no, madam, you're wrong again.
I never thought of you that way.
Look, you were crying...
...and I felt I should help you.
But you obviously didn't realize that.
Come on, let me drop you home.
What were you doing alone,
crying on the bridge?
I live nearby here.
Is that why you were crying?
I live nearby too, but I don't cry.
I must say, madam,
you're very funny.
See, there are no roads
without potholes...
...and no life without
problems and sorrows.
Hey! Why are you
touching my feet?
Oh, you dropped your anklet.
See, you look much better
when you smile.
It's unfair to see you so sad.
No, actually sadness
suits you just fine.
Let me tell you one thing,
sorrow is inevitable.
I'm telling you.
It creeps into everyone's life.
But don't worry,
I know a way to fight it.
It's a secret.
Pretend life is a boxing ring...
...and unhappiness your opponent.
It has countless hands,
but you have two.
If it appears before you,
don't be afraid.
Look straight into its eyes...
...understand and gauge its strength,
and then...
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the fight of the century.
On one corner is a beautifuI young
lady, and on one is unhappiness.
And the crowd goes mad.
But don't forget...
...unhappiness is
a very strong opponent.
Now start fighting.
Move. Bounce.
It will first get you in the face.
You'll be hurt.
No worries, keep fighting.
With the next hit, you will fall.
But the trick is to stand up
and face me.
Because if you give up
by the third round...
...then every punch will fill
your eyes with tears...
...every jab will steaI
the smile from your lips.
By the fifth round,
it'll force its way into your home...
...and snatch away all happiness.
By the sixth round,
everything you love will be finished.
It will be a totaI knockout! The winner
will be unhappiness! Yes! Yes! Yes!
Though you're happy, there's still
a glint of sadness in your eyes.
But happiness suits you well too.
That's my house.
Your house is so beautifuI.
It's too bad we got here so soon.
Wish you lived a little further away.
Wish we'd be together
a little longer-
And wish this rain hadn't stopped...
...so we could stay under
this umbrella forever.
Ranbir Raj.
You can call me Raj.
And you are?
Just a minute, stay where you are!
What's your problem?
Aren't we friends now?
You still won't tell me your name!
You refused my hand five times
in this meeting.
If I guess your name
in the next five seconds...
...you will have to shake my hand.
if I can't, you'll never see me again.
One.
Two.
Three.
Sakina!
It's nearly midnight. Come inside!
You are Sakina.
If Grandma finds out,
you're going to be miserable all Eid.
- Yes, Jhumri Aapa, I'm coming.
- Come quickly.
- Will we meet again tomorrow night?
- Who knows...
- ... what will happen tomorrow?
- What will happen tomorrow?
If the moon appears tomorrow,
it will be Eid...
...or else I will be waiting for you.
Goodbye.
Sakina.
Sakina.
Sakina.
Sakina.
Since your eyes met mine
Since your eyes met mine
Been like a dazed fool
Been like a detached fool
The Almighty seems dazed too
The Almighty seems dazed too
Since your eyes met mine
Since I got a sign from you
I've been so very restless
Since I got a sign from you
I've been so very restless
Since you whispered to me
I've lost all senses totally
Since our hearts connected
Been like a dazed fool
Been like a detached fool
The Almighty seems dazed too
The Almighty seems dazed too
Since your eyes met mine
Raj!
Raj, get up, you idiot!
How can you sleep like this?
It's you, Lilipop.
Good morning, my sweetie.
I waited the whole night for you...
...and you snuck up
from the window again...
- ... and fell asleep on the piano, idiot!
- Your idiot is in love.
What did you say?
Your idiot is in love, Lilipop.
Hey, where's the whiskey?
Finally, God has been kind
to this fooI.
Extremely kind, Lilipop.
What's her name?
Sakina.
Sakina, what a beautifuI name.
How does she look?
She's a beauty, Lilipop.
She's like a grand piano,
like a violin...
...like a trumpet, like a saxophone,
like a guitar!
Is this a girI or an orchestra?
Lilipop, don't act smart.
So when do I get to meet her?
I'll meet her tonight
and tell her how I feeI...
...then she will be mine
and I'll introduce her to you.
I hope you don't mind.
If it were my son, Vincent,
would I mind?
Will you leave me and go away
once you're married?
If it were Vincent,
would he leave you?
He did.
But this is Raj,
who will never leave you.
You know, Raj, I feeI like singing.
Of course, of course.
The flowers that bloom in the spring
Tra-la
Have nothing to do with the case
For I have under my wing
Tra-la
The most preposterous thing
Tra-la
With a caricature of a face
Tra-la
With a caricature of a face
Bravo, bravo, bravo!
And now I am going to sing
another song.
- Good evening, Mr. D'Costa.
- Good evening.
- What's this?
- Leave application.
Leave application?
I won't be able to sing tonight.
Why not?
You see, sir, I have someone
waiting for me...
...and it's cruciaI I meet this person.
Sir, I am so excited.
What about all these people
waiting for you to sing?
Sir, don't worry, I'll personally
apologize to each of them.
I'm not my usuaI self today.
I really have to go.
Hold it.
You're not going anywhere tonight.
Sir, please.
You will perform as long
as the audience wants you to.
Got it?
Then I'm sorry, sir...
...I resign.
Success already gone
to your head?
A handfuI of people applaud you...
...and it's gone to your head.
If you don't sing tonight...
...you're out for good.
Think about it.
You're in some hurry, Saawariya.
Sakina sure is a lucky girI...
...to have an admirer like you.
You know Sakina?
I am the princess of the streets.
Take a step and I'll tell you how
the rest of your journey will be.
This is the path of love...
...so beware how you tread.
Listen.
Don't ever love someone so much...
...that you begin to hate
yourself one day.
Well said, Gulabji.
You must be really stupid...
...to want to quit a job like this.
Want?
I want something else...
...and for her,
I'm willing to forsake everything.
Very impressive.
Just remember,
you'll never get this chance again.
Strike the iron while it's hot, my boy.
Sakina!
Sakina!
Hey, don't act smart, okay?
What's your problem?
Okay, bye! I'm leaving.
What's this about?
Sakina!
Sakina, Sakina, Sakina.
I'm seeing you after ages.
Where are you heading
alone so late?
Your grandma won't
worry about you?
My child, the world is not
a safe place anymore.
It's been raining heavily,
Khalajaan...
...and so much work to do for Eid...
...so I had to leave this late.
Sakina, everything came
at the same time this year.
Today are the Friday prayers,
tomorrow Eid...
...and this bad weather
to add to the chaos.
And our friendship too.
Do you know him?
- Sure, we're-
- No, I don't. He's a stranger.
Stranger?
God help us.
Can't two women
talk in peace anymore?
You scoundreI, eavesdropping
on women's conversation.
Didn't I tell you that the world
is not a safe place anymore?
Come on, we'll finish our
conversation somewhere else.
Okay, tell me,
how is Nabeela Aapa?
Listen...
- ... will you please hear me out, Raj?
- Ranbir Raj, okay?
I'm some stranger, remember? And a
scoundreI to some people. So please.
Please forgive me, Ranbir Raj.
But you misunderstood me.
How's that?
If you didn't like meeting me,
you could have said so yesterday.
I would have forgotten you
like a beautifuI dream.
And if I had spoken to you...
...Khalajaan would have
told everyone at home.
It would've become difficult
for me to leave home.
Then our friendship
would've lasted only a night.
Friendship, my yo-yo!
Do you even know what it means?
I yelled out for you earlier.
- And I heard you.
- And you still walked away?
I was afraid of what
you would think about me.
Just met this girI a night ago...
...and she's already
gotten so friendly.
That's good...
...good thinking.
You pick and choose
your friendship...
...and make your own rules
only to break them.
You forget friends once
the moment passes, not me.
And there's one thing I really
admire about you.
Even before the day was out,
you changed colors.
A friend last night,
a stranger the next morning.
And I swear, I swear, I swear, madam,
it would've been much better...
...if I had waited for a blue moon
to appear than for your friendship.
Have you understood? I guess not!
Oh, my God.
You speak so well.
Listen, Raj.
Sorry, the shop's closed,
please come tomorrow.
Look, I'm warning you,
I'm a very dangerous man.
Okay, I'm really sorry.
You don't have to-
You may not have forgiven me,
but I have.
- Please listen to me-
- Don't follow me!
Sorry, we're closed.
What?
Look, don't you dare laugh now.
Sakina, Sakina, Sakina!
Stop!
What are you doing? Let me go.
Why should I? I'm a scoundreI.
Raj, I don't like this behavior.
Let me go!
And a rogue too.
And unruly.
Forgive me.
And a little stupid.
Leave my hand.
Raj, someone will see us!
Where are you taking me?
- Where have you brought me?
- Oh, I love this place, Sakina.
I come here when I'm really happy.
Or...
...if I'm really sad.
The world looks so beautifuI
from up here.
Not as beautifuI as you.
Really.
What are you doing? Leave me.
- Leave you? Fine.
- No, no, I will die! Oh, God!
Are you okay?
Sakina, I was just joking.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
You really scared me.
Is this your idea of a joke?
I thought about you all night.
You must have
thought about me too?
Why would I?
I don't even know you.
Don't know me?
You know my name.
You even know that
I'm the lead singer at the RK Bar.
I have no family besides Lilianji.
And address,
if you come with me, I'll show you.
See, I've told you all about me.
Now it's your turn.
Come on.
My name and address,
you found out last night.
Work, I weave carpets.
Family, just Grandma and I...
...and our caretaker, Jhumri Aapa.
And your parents?
Grandma says Father went away.
Where? No one knows.
And Mother waited for him
with anticipation...
...untiI the very end.
That's it.
You know what, Sakina?
When God takes everything
away from us...
...in return he sends someone
to take care of us...
- ... like Lilipop for me.
- And Grandma for me.
Raj.
Rubbish.
Hey, Sakina.
Grandma does love you, right?
Yes, a lot.
But she's a little strict.
She keeps me pinned to her
with a huge safety pin.
Safety pin?
Who'd do something like that?
Stop making up stories, Sakina.
Grandma can't see very well.
She's afraid I will leave her,
like my parents did.
That's why she keeps me pinned
to her side all the time.
If she kept you pinned,
you wouldn't be here at this hour.
I've left someone else
pinned in my place.
Do you understand?
Jhumri? Correct?
That means Grandma isn't strict.
It is you who is disobedient.
Come, let's go get a cup of coffee.
What happened?
Raj, I can't come with you.
Why can't you come?
I need to go to the bridge.
The bridge?
I'm waiting for someone.
Who are you waiting for, Sakina?
Someone speciaI.
SpeciaI? Who?
Someone who I love dearly.
What happened?
Why are you so quiet?
No, nothing.
May I know his name?
I can't say his name.
It is said that by speaking
his name aloud...
...the person's life becomes shorter.
Why don't you
write his name instead?
Raj?
Not Raj, Imaan.
Oh, God.
You made me say his name.
You are really wicked.
You know, Raj, we were
in such a bad state financially...
...that we were forced to rent out
the extra room.
I can still remember that night.
The entire town was asleep...
...when a sudden knock
on the door woke us up.
Grandma.
Grandma, someone's knocking
on the door.
Must be the new tenant,
go wake Jhumri.
Okay.
Salaam.
Imaan.
We have a lifetime
to gaze at each other.
Shall we go in?
Sakina, what does this
paying guest look like?
Ugly, like a drenched cat.
Is he from here?
No, Grandma,
he is from out of town.
How old is he?
Quite young,
wouldn't be a day over 60.
Nonsense.
Wrinkled face, sallow eyes...
...and his darn coughing
kept me up all night.
God save us.
Jhumri? Where's Jhumri?
Yes, yes, I'm right here.
Better find another paying guest.
He's got one foot in the grave
and the other about to topple.
- You never know how long he'll last.
- Come on now, Grandma.
Sakina, I suggest you better take
an advance from him.
You want me to go?
Send Jhumri Aapa,
she's the one who got him here.
Will Jhumri do all the work?
You don't do a darn thing.
Go tell that old chap that he will
be fed only once a day.
And no tea. Should I say that?
- Tell him.
- Okay, Grandma, I'll go tell him.
Haven't you left yet?
What are you doing?
Undo the pin, you fooI!
Can't do a thing right.
Does the opposite
of everything I say.
The rent.
And I drink milk, not tea.
Why were you showering me
with all these praises?
You're innocent...
...but not naive.
Have you taken a good look at me?
You should, I'm not all that bad.
Goodbye.
"The prince suddenly appeared
in the princess's life...
...his piercing eyes
and caressing voice...
...swept her off her feet. "
How did a prince appear
in this story?
He wasn't even
mentioned anywhere.
That's what I'm wondering,
am I dreaming or is she?
Look at her standing there,
mumbling to herself.
Dreaming of him
with these eyes wide open...
...I began to feel the pain
of my longing.
I hadn't seen him for days.
Finally breaking all barriers...
...I ended up at his doorstep.
Good morning.
Do come in, Imaan Saheb.
Who?
It's our paying, Imaan Saheb.
Good day, Nabila Bi.
You too, please have a seat.
How are you?
I trust in good health?
God has been kind.
Sakina, my child, come here.
Yes, Grandma.
How old did you say he was?
How old did you say he was?
It's only been a few days
since I turned senile.
I must say, your voice sounds
strong for your age.
FeeI my body,
I've kept myself young and virile.
Goodness, what are you saying,
Nawab Saheb?
Tell me, what brings you here?
I thought of you and came by.
So have you decided?
About what?
Sakina, my child.
You haven't told her yet.
What have you forgotten now?
Not a big deaI, Nabbo Bi.
There's a screening of the classic
film Mughal-e-Azam near the river.
It would be nice if we go together.
Normally I don't get out much,
but if you insist, why not?
Will you be able to see all right?
Keep quiet, fooI!
Who needs to see? I can listen.
There's no fear in love
There's no fear in love
You have fallen in love
Not committed a crime
So don't be a sissy
But life had just begun writing
the tale of our love...
...when destiny suddenly
ran out of words.
The very next day
Jhumri Aapa told me...
...he was leaving
our house for good.
Sakina.
Stop crying.
- Come on, wipe your tears.
- Sakina?
You'll always be in my heart...
...but I can't take you with me.
I work for the country.
Where I am going there's danger...
...and relationships are a weakness.
I want you to be my strength...
...and you'd rather be
my weakness?
Sakina?
I will miss you a lot.
I will miss you whenever I see
someone reading a book...
...whenever someone
screams hysterically...
...or whenever someone
laughs while crying...
...or cries while laughing...
...I will miss you.
That night as we parted ways...
...he promised he'd return...
...a year later on the night of Eid
at this bridge.
Since then, I've been anxiously
waiting for him and the night of Eid.
- What is this?
- A token of his promise.
That night, he gave me this
before he left.
Your token is fake...
...and so is your story.
This is not a story, it's the truth.
I don't believe it, Sakina.
You mean to tell me
that you're in love with a man...
...who shows up one rainy day...
...and disappears into the mist
the next.
Do you even know what
he does for a living?
- No.
- Where does he live?
- I don't know.
- He must surely have an address?
I don't know anything.
So obviously, you don't know
where he's gone?
What relevance do these questions
have with my love?
They do. How do you expect a man
with no address to take care of you?
Has he even written to you
this past year?
Going to take care.
The only token he's left you with
is sorrow and loneliness.
These are false promises.
Wow, my lucky day.
Money rolling in
without having to sweat for it.
Listen, that's mine!
But I found it on the street.
Please, give me back my coin.
Yours? But I don't see
your name on it.
Look, I don't argue with
women like you...
...just return my coin.
Why are decent people like you
so afraid to even take our names?
All right! What's your name?
The name doesn't matter,
it's the price that matters.
Gulabji...
- ... please return that coin.
- You know her?
Of course. We're neighbors...
...aren't we, Saawariya?
Stop teasing her
and give the coin back.
If you insist, I'd give my life.
The coin is nothing.
Why did you do this?
Let her go!
Let her realize...
...how much you love her.
Just one meeting and you've been...
...writing her name on every wall
and every stone in this town.
Let her realize that in love...
...sometimes stones are
more valuable than coins.
Raj!
Come here quick!
Raj!
- What happened, Sakina?
- You said he won't come, right?
Look at this.
He's written my name all over.
It means he's here.
If he's arrived, then why
hasn't he come to see you?
Maybe he is testing my love.
Maybe he's hiding here
and watching me.
Oh, God. He loves me so much.
Look at this token, Ranbir Raj...
...it symbolizes faith and true love.
And you'll see,
he will fulfill his promise.
Didn't I tell you?
He'll come and take me away?
Stop it, Sakina!
You'll catch a cold and fall sick.
Sick? I am already lovesick!
You've gone crazy. You laugh and
then suddenly break down and cry.
Come on, Sakina, let's go!
Can I say something?
Tell me.
I really-
This darn rain. God!
It's tough to get home.
Isn't it, young lady?
So do you think it will
stop raining tonight?
In the rain, you saw me
My love, I saw you in the rain
Raj, do you consider me
your friend?
- Yes.
- So tell me, what should I do?
About what?
Imaan?
You can't take his name
or even ask about him?
- But you can write to him, can't you?
- You mean a letter?
We can try?
We sure can do this...
...but he shouldn't feeI
I'm imposing myself on him.
You wait up for him every night,
cry on the slightest excuse.
It's better you do something about this
rather than suffering in silence.
If you insist, I will try to do this.
If you were in my place
what would you write?
- I would swear at him.
- I will too.
- You?
- Yes, me. But you start.
I'd write, "You silly man,
don't bother returning...
...I am now in love with a nice
talented young man named Raj. "
Told you so,
you always interrupt me.
Let's start like this:
"I have only desired you
with a pure heart. "
I was also going to write this.
Okay. So assume what you were
going to write, I have already written it.
- Should we swear at him now?
- He won't feeI bad, right?
If you send this
with a genuine heart, he won't.
With faith?
Yes. I guess so.
You are a little roguish
You are a little innocent
You are a little roguish
You are a little innocent
But this is the fact too
You're my whole world
You are a little roguish
You are a little innocent
But this is the fact too
You're my whole world
You tantalize my breath
You are my adornment
You are my longing
My conscience, my grace, my honor
You are a little mischievous
You are a little naughty
You are a little mischievous
You are a little naughty
But this is the fact too
you are my everything
You
Innocent
Rogue.
I just asked you for one favor
and you didn't do it.
You call yourself a friend?
Don't worry,
I've memorized the entire letter.
Tomorrow I'll neatly write it for you.
You simply go and post it.
Liar. You're such a liar.
In any case, tomorrow will be
the last night of our friendship.
Eventually when I leave with him,
I know you'll feeI sad.
Thank God. At least you've given
my feelings some thought.
For the last two nights,
it's only been you and your sad story.
Do you have some problems too?
Well, not really...
...but you never know,
I could have some tomorrow.
Well, can I bother you
with something?
What?
This letter?
Yes, I wrote it for him.
Sakina, if you'd already written one
then why did you ask me?
Well, just to make sure
what I've written is all right.
But what you were thinking
is exactly what I've written.
You will deliver this letter for me,
won't you?
I knew you wouldn't turn me down.
Jhumri told me that he is staying at
the Momin Lodge in the old city.
I know it's pretty far away...
...but will you please do it?
Raj, I have to leave now.
God forbid, if Grandma wakes up
then I'll be in trouble.
Wait, Sakina! I'll walk you home.
No, Raj, I'll go by myself.
Please just deliver my letter. Okay?
But, Sakina, will we meet tomorrow?
If you come back with a reply,
then I sure will.
Hey, but what if I don't get a reply?
Then I'll harass you even more.
Now, don't forget to deliver
my letter, okay?
- And, Raj?
- What?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow.
Okay, bye!
Okay, bye!
Love can be brutal at times.
It turns a stone to God
and an angel into stone.
That night I saw a lover
consumed by love.
Those two nights of romance
had unsettled him forever.
And I feared what fate
held in store for him.
Who is it?
No rest for the deviI.
They won't leave you alone.
They just keep knocking at it.
You?!
Hi, darling, how you?
Not "how you," it's "how are you?"
How did you get in here?
Using my feet, walking.
Walk.
Come on, get out of here!
I've come to meet my Saawariya.
There's no Saawariya here.
Oh, my sweetheart...
...of course he's here,
my Saawariya at the window.
How do you know him?
By heart. From my heart.
He's not feeling well,
he won't come.
Tell him Sakina's here...
...he'll come running.
Sakina?
Your name is Sakina?
Can't it be?
Raj! Where are you, Raj?
What happened?
If she's Sakina,
then you're out of my house!
I'm warning you.
If this harlot comes into
this house again...
...you will never be seen
in this town!
Do you understand?
Gulabji, what are you doing here?
Your name is Gulabji?
So you lied to me!
My dear, If I told you the truth,
you wouldn't have called him...
...and he wouldn't have come.
What's the matter, Saawariya?
You look worried since last night,
what's wrong?
It's no big deaI.
My visit here is also no big deaI,
just to invite you for my birthday.
If you get a chance, drop by.
We'll have a good time.
I'm sure that happens every day.
But today it's just for me, darling.
You're invited too.
Are you done talking?
I'm done with him, but not with you.
Look, darling,
you're alone and I'm alone.
You have a house which you
turned into a guesthouse.
I didn't have anything besides this
body, so I turned it into a guesthouse.
Customers come to both our places.
They sleep and pay money.
So doesn't that make you
a woman selling her wares too?
We all do something to survive,
right, love?
Do come. Bye, darling.
Do come, Saawariya.
Bitch.
Whoever it is, tell them I'm busy.
The chief guest is here!
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
This is such a sad song.
I don't likes.
I'm sorry to upset you
on your birthday.
Did you really think
it's my birthday?
My naive boy.
It's this day that I was initiated
into the business.
On a day that's meant to be sad,
I've used as an excuse to be happy.
I am usually happy,
but a bit low today.
Any problem, Gulabji?
Last night I saw a friend
commit a sin.
You lied to her, didn't you?
You're such a liar.
Now there's only one way
to make me happy.
Go hug her, tell her how you feeI
and apologize for last night.
I can't face her, let alone hug her.
I just can't go, Gulabji.
You won't go?
Look, partner.
It's the right moment today...
...and the perfect time
in this season of love.
Once it passes, it won't return.
Are you going to do something
or just keep nodding your head?
You know,
you're really good-hearted.
I'm sure your girI is
good-hearted too.
And if she were here,
you know what she'd say?
What would she say?
Mod, handsome, showy, lively
Elegant, shapely, juicy, ardent
Graceful attire, stubborn actor
Tight pants, loose shirt
Handsome, lively, stubborn
Graceful, stubborn
Pants are loose
Oh, handsome

So sad and so lonely
Sakina, where are you going?
My child, where are you going
on this stormy night?
You know where I am going.
You gave me the address.
I sent a letter to that address
and I'm going to get my reply.
What letter? What reply?
I've had to deaI with your truancies
the last few nights.
You take off every night,
leaving me alone, pinned to Grandma.
But after you leave,
I cannot sleep a wink.
For God's sake, my child,
if something were to happen to you...
...what would I say to Grandma?
That's it, you are not going anywhere
on this dark, stormy night.
Come in at once!
No darkness harms those
enlightened in love.
Raj?
Raj?
Raj?
Raj?
For the first time
in the history of India...
...you are ironing
your shirt yourself?
And yesterday, you chose to come
from the door, not the pipe.
Since the last two days, you haven't
sung, boxed or bothered me.
Is something wrong?
Did you fight with Sakina?
A small one or big one?
Oh, big fight.
It's your fault, I know it.
Now go and confess to God.
Everything will be all right.
Then I would like to confess to you.
You know how much I love Sakina.
And I deceived her.
For the last year,
she's been waiting for someone else.
And the other night she gave me
a letter addressed to that man.
I burnt that letter.
Burning the letter, that is your sin...
...but repentance...
...that is your pure souI.
What should I do?
Go find that man and instead of
the letter give him the message.
And then leave everything to God.
But I don't want to lose her, Lilipop.
If that girI is meant for you...
...then nothing on earth
can keep her from you...
...and if she isn't meant for you...
...then nothing on earth
can bring her to you.
The decision isn't in your hands,
it's in God's.
Now we have to see...
...how God decides
to place his cross.
This way or that way.
Listen, I am tired of telling you
there's no Imaan here.
Brother, I've traveled for three hours.
Please, just check once more.
It is a matter of life and death.
Hey, Aslam, go and check
number 110. Yes, tell me.
- Last year too.
- Last year, many men came and left.
Okay, if Imaan does show up,
let him know...
...that Sakina is waiting
for him by the bridge.
It has been raining heavy for
three days, no one can come or go.
You'd better leave at once too.
That means no Imaan will come...
- ... and he probably doesn't even exist.
- Won't come.
That means I did nothing wrong
by burning that letter.
Did nothing wrong.
- That means God is with me.
- Yes, with you.
- That means Sakina is mine!
- Yes, yes, Sakina is yours! Take her!
- Hey! Let go of me!
- Yes!
Yes, my Lilipop!
Understand what I'm saying.
The rain has closed all the roads
up the mountain.
Now no one can come.
For the last three days,
no one has left or come to this lodge.
Even if I had taken the letter,
who would've read it?
Listen to me, Sakina has fooled me!
There is no Imaan, he doesn't exist!
No, I was talking to myself.
I'll come home and explain
everything to you!
I love her too much, Lilipop.
I can't do without her.
I love her!
Look, Jhumri, a new carpet.
You kept asking
who's this huge carpet for?
It's for our Nawab Saheb.
He will enter our home
with this beneath his feet.
- What do you think of it?
- It's okay.
Are you still angry
because of last night?
- Come on, please forgive me.
- All right, you're forgiven.
Jhumri, we'll celebrate Eid
lavishly today.
Look how well
I've decorated the house.
So have you gotten your reply?
I'm asking you,
did you get your reply?
No...
...but the Eid moon will rise today,
he will come, and so will my answer.
He'll ask Grandma for my hand,
and we'll be married...
...and if he wants, he can be
Grandma's son and I his bride.
Why are you crying?
I'm not leaving so soon.
I'm crying at your obsession...
...and at my deceit.
Just for your sake
I lied that I saw Imaan.
So that you'd be happy during Eid.
But your madness...
Maybe you're destined to wait
eternally, just the way your mother did.
Mark my words. He won't come!
Jhumri, you don't even
know how to lie.
He will come, just you wait
till the moon rises.
I know he will come.
Moon, why do you
show off so much?
Will you just appear? The boy
has to go and propose to his love.
If you take so long, how will he go?
You're talking to the moon?
Has it appeared?
That moon hasn't appeared,
but mine has.
Let's see how you look.
Very handsome.
Thanks. After all,
I'm going to wish Sakina on Eid.
Are you just going to wish her or are
you going to tell her how you feeI?
That's the problem, Lilipop.
See how nervous I am.
Why are you so nervous?
Be a man.
This is the most important day
of your life.
You're going to propose to Sakina...
...so make it memorable.
Superb idea, but how?
Walk in like a king
and call out to her.
Look at her and smile.
If she comes near, move away.
And what if she moves away?
If she moves away, call out to her.
"Oh, my love. "
If she turns to look at you, beckon her.
If she comes close, take her hand.
If she resists, hold her tight.
Put your face close to her
and share your feelings with her.
"I love you, baby!"
And then, if you kiss her lips,
she will be yours forever.
Forget Sakina.
Lilipop, will you marry me?
You rascaI, get out of here!
Hurry before someone else
steals her away!
Impossible!
Sweetie, today Raj is a rock star.
You just see, baby.
Whether the moon shines or not...
...tonight it will definitely shine
in this house.
Before bringing Sakina home,
I'll call you.
Wait for my call.
Okay, bye!
Okay, bye!
The moonlight was never
This gorgeous before
The moon was confused
Saw you and was embarrassed
Now he's just shying away
The moonlight was never
This gorgeous before
The moonlight was never
This gorgeous before
The moon was confused
Saw you and was embarrassed
Now he's just shying away
This gorgeous
Behold, the moon is here
The moon is finally here
Behold, the moon is here
The moon is finally here
Behold, the moon is here
The moon is finally here
It's here, it's here, it's here
The moon is here, shying away
It's here, it's here, it's here
The moon is here, shying away
Do come now, you too
My love
It's here, it's here, it's here
The moon is here
The moon is here, it's here
It's here, it's here, the moon is here
Shying away, it's here
It's here, the moon is here
Slowly, slowly the breeze flows
Whispers quietly
Everything about you
How sweet is this pain
Searing through my senses
Every moment is intoxicated
In a stupor I fall
Here and there
Silent glances drive me nuts
I'm so insanely in love with you
This gorgeous
You trouble me a lot.
Someone's looking very
handsome tonight.
You finally agreed.
What was the answer?
It's a yes for me.
Did you meet him?
Sakina, will you marry me?
How is he doing?
Is he all right? What did he say?
- Sakina, I was-
- Tell me straight up...
- ... did you meet him or not?
- You're not talking straight either.
Raj, my life depends on this.
Mine too.
I can't live a moment without him.
And I can't forget you
for a moment.
Sakina, if you're happy
then I'm happy...
...and your sorrow is mine.
I love you, baby!
Will you marry me?
Jokes.
Your silly jokes.
Can't you take anything seriously?
Where were you yesterday?
I waited the whole night for you.
For me? Don't you usually
wait for Imaan here?
But last night I waited just for you.
Okay, I'll believe you.
It's time.
- I have to go meet someone.
- Whom?
Someone speciaI.
Who's this girI?
What is it to you?
All right, go if you have to...
...but there must be a way
to know his answer.
Hope he didn't take offense
to the letter.
Raj, if it was you-
Please, now don't say
if I were in his place.
I sent the letter like you asked me
and that's it.
Believe me,
the letter's quite useless...
...since Imaan doesn't even exist!
If you say that again,
I won't ever speak to you!
Okay, Sakina, I have a way
to find out his reply.
What?
Sakina, we'll pick notes
to figure out his answer.
Oh, my God!
You did give him my note, right?
Oh, not the letter, stupid!
I mean the notes
that say yes and no.
Okay, fine, go ahead and write.
So on the first one we will write,
"He will not come. "
You started that again.
Come on, look there. No cheating.
And on the other one we'll write,
"He will come. "
Are you done writing?
No cheating.
Here, choose your destiny.
Didn't you have to go somewhere?
- Where?
- To meet someone speciaI.
Oh, yes. I completely forgot.
You should leave soon.
Without you?
You can't do without me?
What can I do?
You've become a habit now.
And tomorrow,
when I'm not around?
Then...
Then...
It's a strange evening.
We haven't spoken a word
in the past hour.
We haven't eaten
or drunk anything.
Just been sitting around like this.
Sad, isn't it?
- Shall we leave now?
- Why? We've just-
No, Raj, you called upon our
friendship, that's why I came.
Anyway, I feeI a bit
out of place here.
- What if he is already at the bridge?
- So what?
Sakina, you've waited
a whole year for him.
And even if Imaan turns up early,
can't he wait five minutes for you?
Let's forget all this for a few moments.
Today is Eid, a day to celebrate.
Isn't this a good idea?
A better idea would be
to leave here.
I've had enough.
Friends, friends, friends!
Have any of you
ever loved anyone?
- Yes!
- I have too.
That's great, but what about her?
That's just it.
I doubt she ever will.
No, but does that stop me
from loving her?
Friends? Does that stop me
from loving her?
No!
So then, my favorite song
for that speciaI girI.
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Set you in a palanquin
Decorate it with stars
Steal you away from this world
Steal you from this world
Steal away your heart
Oh, my love
Under the tent of your lashes
Inside the cave of your dreams
Are embedded your shadows
You there in all my yearnings
I fell hard for your silent, sweet gaze
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Oh, my love
Set you in a palanquin
Decorate it with stars
Steal you away from this world
I wanna be your date tonight
You're gonna be my princess in white
I'll never let you out of my sight
Please be my date tonight
I wanna be your date tonight
You're gonna be my princess in white
I'll never let you out of my sight
Please be my date tonight
Lilipop? Hi. Guess what.
Sakina is with me.
Yes! And I'm bringing her home.
Okay, okay. Now listen carefully...
...when I bring her home, sing those
old classic songs on the piano.
Have you rehearsed it? Fantastic.
We'll start the evening with that.
Listen, ask Maria to take out
all your old photo albums.
Sakina will look at your
photographs all night...
...and I will look at her.
Good idea, isn't it?
And is your plum cake ready?
Good, good, good.
But don't force her to cut it.
Please don't put up any balloons.
It's no one's birthday.
And the most important thing...
...when we get there,
please don't cry.
Yes. Don't start crying.
Okay, okay. Now don't forget to wear
that black frilly frock of yours.
Sakina and I are coming home.
And remember, you will always
be my first love, Lilipop!
Oh, God. She's so happy,
if only you could see her.
Tell her it's because it was
my first time dancing at a party.
She danced to my song, and how!
If only you could see her.
Tell her that I wish her
a very happy Eid.
She's wishing you a happy Eid.
- Same to you.
- Same to you.
- And where's my present?
- She's also asking for her gift.
Okay. Hang on,
you'd better ask her yourself.
- What will I say?
- She's a very nice lady.
Sakina.
Sakina?
- I have to go.
- Where?
- To the bridge.
- What?
He'll be waiting for me.
Who will be waiting?
- Raj, let me go.
- Sakina, just talk once to Lilipop.
For God's sake,
please let me go, Raj.
- Hear me out. Sakina!
- I don't want to hear anything!
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?
For God's sake,
please let me go, Raj.
Come on, Sakina,
just talk to her, please.
Please.
Sakina! Wait!
Lilipop, Sakina's feeling shy.
Oh, look at her. Stop! Stop it!
No, no, no, we're not fighting,
she's tickling me.
Yeah, okay. We're just coming home.
We'll be home soon.
Okay, bye. Okay.
Sakina!
Sakina!
Sakina!
- Leave me alone!
- At least listen to what I'm trying to say.
- I don't want to hear a word!
- No, Sakina. You have to listen to me!
Sakina, I cannot live without you.
Forget him, please.
I'll keep you happy.
We'll create a world of our own.
My world is Imaan, that's it!
Then what were these four nights
you spent with me?
That was just friendship, Raj!
Simple friendship.
And if I were unfaithfuI to him
for even a moment...
...then may God never, ever
forgive me. Never, ever...
...never forgive me.
In any case, God will not forgive you,
because you have hurt me, Sakina.
And you know...
...you know how much I love you.
And I hate you!
He was right.
That man was right for you...
...left a token in your hand,
and disappeared, never to look back.
He was so right!
He was so right.
Saawariya?
What's the matter?
I was hoping to catch sight
of the moon through the window...
...but you just walked right in
through the door.
Can I sit here for a while?
You are the first man who has
come here just to sit.
The others always...
- Were you going somewhere?
- Yes, we're celebrating Eid at Razia's.
But you can come in.
There must be celebrations
at your girlfriend's too, right?
Did you meet her last night or not?
I'd figured that you and her would
have been sitting on the bridge...
...whispering sweet nothings
into each other's ears.
That bridge is broken, Gulabji.
What I mistook for reality
turned out to be an illusion.
How comes?
If she believes she has Imaan
and I have no one...
...she is wrong.
I can also love someone else
besides her.
Can you really?
- Sure, I can. With you.
- Me?
Oh, my Saawariya...
...do paper flowers
ever carry fragrance?
Right now, you're not thinking straight.
We'll talk tomorrow.
Get going.
I won't go.
But I need to go.
As the night moves on,
customers will start lining up soon.
Where will you sit then?
Then think of me as one
of your customers tonight.
I'll pay for every second
of your time.
Naseeban!
Naseeban!
Get out!
Get lost from here!
Didn't you hear what Gulab said?
We've seen a lot like you.
If you show up again,
I'll break your legs. Go!
Don't you dare even say
Gulab's name again!
Gulabji!
- You're done for!
- Gulabji!
Gulabji!
What?
Hey, stop messing around
and leave now.
Gulabji!
What's wrong with you?
You love him so much...
...and yet you threw him out of here.
- He's getting beaten up downstairs.
- Then let him.
If I didn't kick him out,
he'd be spending the rest of his life...
...getting kicked around
these filthy streets.
- But, Gulab, don't you feeI that-?
- That's enough!
One more word out of you
and you've had it!
Get out!
Forgive me, Raj.
I have really hurt you.
You were right...
...he's not come
and I doubt if he ever will.
I don't know about all that.
AII I want to say is that...
...I burnt the letter you gave me.
And you know why.
And you probably won't
believe this either...
...but I did go look for him today.
There was no Imaan there.
But if you still insist,
I guess I can try again.
No, Raj.
There's no need.
Burning that letter was probably
the best thing to do.
How much more ridicule can I bear?
I really want to forget him.
It's difficult, but I will try my best.
You're with me, right?
Is this something you really
need to ask, Sakina?
You've given him
a whole year of your life...
...but I'm willing to give
a whole lifetime to forget him.
An entire lifetime!
What happened?
Did you see that?
For a moment, you forgot him,
didn't you?
Trust me, Sakina.
I'll make you happy
and you will forget him.
Can I ask you something?
Is there even a little place
in your heart for me?
No problem. I guess
it will take some time.
No problem.
Look at you. You're sad again.
In the next three seconds...
...if I don't make you smile,
you won't see me ever.
One.
Two.
Three.
Three.
Three.
Three.
Three.
- My umbrella?
- Yes, you had forgotten it yesterday.
- That means you were here last night.
- Yes. No. Actually-
Raj, I'm going to hit you!
No, no, wait, hold this umbrella.
Here, try now.
I think you've gone mad.
Don't stop me, Sakina.
I'm a different man today.
I'm so happy that I don't
know what to do!
Everyone's asleep. Be quiet!
Just wait and see tomorrow,
when people wake up, they'll say:
"It's a beautifuI day!"
You will say that also, won't you?
My sweetest
You are the only one in this heart
Just you and only you
You are the only one in this heart
You are mine
Only mine
Only mine
Don't torture me
Don't leave me, please
I implore you, my sweetest
You are the only one in this heart
You are the only one in this heart
Sakina.
Sakina.
I'll never forget this night.
Lilipop will also be so happy.
I'm too excited!
Oh, sorry.
Tomorrow she will announce
to everybody:
"Sakina is the most beautifuI bride
for my Raj. "
Let's go, she's probably
waiting for us.
Hey, Sakina, what's wrong?
Hello?
He's come, Raj!
He's come!
I have to go...
...I really have to go.
I should go.
You understand me, right?
You do understand me, Raj?
I need you to understand.
I know this is hurting you...
...but please forgive me.
Please forgive me.
Please forgive me.
For a moment I did think
we could be together-
No, Sakina, even if you loved me
for a few moments...
...it's enough to give me joy
for a lifetime.
I swear.
I swear.
Go, Sakina. Go now.
Go, Sakina, be happy and leave...
...and don't worry.
I'll explain to Lilipop.
Just go.
Praise God.
Seems God has taken his time making
you, and he doesn't want to stop.
When I left,
you had tears in your eyes.
Now I'm back
and you're still crying?
Sakina...
...will you agree to live a life
full of hardships with me?
I do.
I do.
I do.
They say if you find true love,
God has been generous to you.
And if you don't, it's because
he has become one with you.
This was the story
of my rock-star angel.
There was Romeo, Majnu,
Mahiwal, Ranjha...
...and my lone Saawariya.
