2
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,142
Woven from my dreams...

3
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:01,912
...this town isn't one
to be pinned onto a map...

4
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,386
...as it exists entirely
in my thoughts.

5
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:09,254
This is my town's most
magnificent bar...

6
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,794
...RK Bar.

7
00:02:12,031 --> 00:02:14,226
Whenever business is good...

8
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,164
...I come here
to have a good imported drink.

9
00:02:18,571 --> 00:02:20,038
It feels good.

10
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:23,573
Me, myself Gulabji.

11
00:02:23,843 --> 00:02:26,505
You won't find anyone quite like me.

12
00:02:26,679 --> 00:02:31,878
One who trades in false romance,
but tells stories of true love.

13
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:35,817
The tale I am about to tell you
isn't of an ordinary man...

14
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,082
...but of an angeI.

15
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:41,227
Torn jeans, guitar in hand...

16
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,294
...a rock-star angeI.

17
00:02:43,463 --> 00:02:45,931
I met him for the first time
in this bar.

18
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,967
Like always, I was the last
customer that night.

19
00:02:51,804 --> 00:02:54,432
Get me another whiskey.

20
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:57,334
And a glass of milk, please.

21
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,448
Who's this, asking for milk in a bar?

22
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:07,746
I'm the new lead singer here.
I'm practicing for my show tomorrow.

23
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:10,381
But this is no place for lullabies.

24
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:12,457
Here, we need
something sensationaI...

25
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,559
...something that stirs the body.

26
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,594
Songs should stir the souI,
not the body.

27
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:22,660
A souI that can't even be seen.

28
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:26,863
Just like a matchstick
that holds fire...

29
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,270
...unless it's lit, it can't be seen.

30
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:34,971
Or like the intoxication of alcohoI
that can't be seen.

31
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:39,276
Well said!
You have a way with words.

32
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,976
I have a way with songs too.
Hear one.

33
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:45,420
Just a few lines, go on.

34
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:59,830
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

35
00:04:00,006 --> 00:04:04,739
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

36
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:19,425
Set you in a palanquin
Decorate it with stars

37
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:22,857
Steal you away from this world

38
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:28,290
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

39
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:32,700
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

40
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,074
Set you in a palanquin

41
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,608
Decorate it with stars

42
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:44,876
Steal you from this world
Steal away your heart

43
00:04:56,562 --> 00:04:58,792
Excuse me, you think I'll be a star?

44
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:02,200
- More likely a superstar.
- Thanks.

45
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,448
He was wonderfuI,
straight out of a girI's dream.

46
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,254
Since then,
his song became his identity...

47
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:30,555
...Saawariya.

48
00:05:36,202 --> 00:05:39,638
For days his voice
echoed in my mind.

49
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:43,071
Each time I thought of him, I smiled.

50
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:47,406
One evening I sat at my usual spot
counting my day's earnings.

51
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,914
Darn, I lost count.

52
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:52,108
Hey! Whose ball is this?

53
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:54,214
It's mine.

54
00:05:55,054 --> 00:05:57,215
Hi. Good evening.

55
00:05:57,390 --> 00:06:00,951
You see, I don't have a pillow,
so I'm using the ball.

56
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,391
The problem is
it keeps rolling away.

57
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,326
Sorry, I'll just pick it up.

58
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,399
Oh, Jesus, aren't you...?

59
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:11,969
- Aren't you the hero from RK Bar?
- Yes.

60
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:17,374
I thought you looked familiar.

61
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,808
But why are you sleeping
on the street?

62
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,709
What else can I do?

63
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:26,978
A new town, a new job,
and no one I know.

64
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:31,715
I can't turn up on anyone's doorstep.
No one would trust a stranger.

65
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:33,722
In short, you have no place to stay.

66
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:35,819
Correct.

67
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,961
You've come to the right place.

68
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:42,932
I live up there.

69
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:47,435
Do you want to give it a try, partner?

70
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,103
Thank you, maybe some other time.

71
00:06:51,611 --> 00:06:53,704
I likes you.

72
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,078
You're the first person
to say no to Gulabji.

73
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,016
You are gorgeous...

74
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:02,677
...and cute guys like you
don't sleep on the street.

75
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:08,449
Lilian, that old hag,
lives across the street.

76
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:10,960
If she likes you,
she'll take you as a paying guest...

77
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,428
...but if she doesn't, you're toast.

78
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,999
Try your luck tomorrow morning.

79
00:07:16,169 --> 00:07:17,727
Thank you.

80
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:21,639
But this is the red-light district.

81
00:07:21,808 --> 00:07:25,300
Will you be able to live here
with these women?

82
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,306
Why not?

83
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:32,715
Aren't they someone's mothers,
sisters and daughters too?

84
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,051
But never anyone's wife.

85
00:07:36,823 --> 00:07:39,223
But they could be someone's friend.

86
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,560
What do you say?
Do you want to give it a try, partner?

87
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,720
You want to be friends? Fine.

88
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,601
It hurts me to hear that little girI cry.

89
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,741
I don't likes.

90
00:07:56,442 --> 00:07:58,740
It is the same story every day.

91
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,714
Her mother's at work
and won't be back all night.

92
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:12,023
Ours is a tough profession
and we'll never get any respite.

93
00:08:12,191 --> 00:08:14,887
We've spent our entire
childhood crying...

94
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,926
...all night without a mother...

95
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:20,793
...waiting for some fairy to appear.

96
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,828
Neither a fairy appeared...

97
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,633
...nor did anyone ever
come to comfort us.

98
00:08:30,943 --> 00:08:32,604
Go back to sleep.

99
00:09:06,812 --> 00:09:14,241
One day an angel will arrive

100
00:09:19,458 --> 00:09:25,988
Never is she ever going back

101
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:37,473
Her soft tiptoe rings in my ears
Day and night

102
00:09:37,677 --> 00:09:46,176
Every moment
I long for her so bad

103
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:56,153
One day an angel will arrive

104
00:10:21,654 --> 00:10:27,183
Befriends with flowers

105
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:32,154
Softer than the buds

106
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:38,632
The moment I look at her

107
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:43,405
She will be a bundle of shyness

108
00:10:43,943 --> 00:10:47,208
Delicately, shyly

109
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:53,643
Nervously, coyly

110
00:10:55,421 --> 00:11:00,916
With cloudy tresses

111
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:05,860
With terrified lips

112
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:14,899
She's going to astound me
As she arrives

113
00:11:19,578 --> 00:11:26,814
One day an angel will arrive

114
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:41,231
She is never going back

115
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:51,866
Her soft tiptoe rings in my ears

116
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:58,313
Day and night, every moment

117
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:03,922
I long for her so bad

118
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:07,082
Wearing the veil of love

119
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:12,461
Adorning the henna of your dreams

120
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,665
Gazing deep in your eyes

121
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:24,504
Sweeping the distances away

122
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:31,880
She will sing songs of your love

123
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:35,378
As she arrives

124
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:46,963
One day an angel will arrive

125
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,124
Lilianji.

126
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:50,489
- Who is it?
- It's me.

127
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,857
Who's me?

128
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,425
I heard that you have
a room for rent.

129
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,999
But who's me?

130
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,362
Ranbir Raj.
But you can call me Raj.

131
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:03,167
Why, did you get drunk
and gamble away your father's name?

132
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,908
I don't gamble, and I swear
I don't touch alcohoI.

133
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,707
Do you have any references?

134
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:12,783
None. Actually, I'm new to this town.

135
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:17,048
Sorry, I don't give out a room
without a reference. Get out.

136
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:21,054
These loafers, they just walk up to this
thinking it's a cheap hoteI.

137
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,619
It's a very proper guesthouse.

138
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,526
Wasting my time.
Here I was painting my nails.

139
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,189
I do have a reference!

140
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,391
What did you say?

141
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:31,468
I do have a reference,
if you don't mind.

142
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:32,968
Who?

143
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:34,730
- You.
- Me?

144
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:37,902
Look, Lilianji, no matter what
someone says about me...

145
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:40,545
...praises or condemns me...

146
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,908
...ultimately it's you
who has to decide.

147
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:47,576
My reference is your heart,
your judgment. Will that do?

148
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:51,450
Do you do any work
or just talk incessantly?

149
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:55,082
As far as work is concerned,
it is mostly music for me.

150
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,828
Your piano isn't tuned.

151
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:00,792
How many keys does a piano have?

152
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:02,991
Eighty-eight.

153
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:06,194
- How many strings on a violin?
- Four.

154
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:09,899
Add one from the heart, and it's five.

155
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,337
What deposit will you pay?

156
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,740
- I'll be the deposit.
- And rent?

157
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,905
UntiI I afford the rent,
I'll do all the chores you want me to.

158
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:19,346
Besides music,
do you do any other work?

159
00:15:19,518 --> 00:15:23,614
Sure, I do. I dream, I write.
I spread joy when there's sorrow.

160
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,450
And if the need arises,
I do manuaI labor too.

161
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:28,058
Sometimes, I can even get by
with bread and water.

162
00:15:28,227 --> 00:15:31,219
By the way, C sharp has a problem,
if you let me-

163
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,366
Just absolutely spoiI my temper.

164
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,598
And the room?

165
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:40,671
If I give you the room, I will also
end up eating only bread like you!

166
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,568
Sticking to me like a leech.

167
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,709
Can I ask you a question?

168
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,367
What?

169
00:15:46,545 --> 00:15:49,105
When was the last time you smiled?

170
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,873
What do you mean?

171
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,018
When did you last call
someone your own?

172
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,054
The last time you loved someone?

173
00:15:57,756 --> 00:16:01,021
The last time you hugged someone?

174
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:03,093
I hugged him.

175
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:08,360
Vincent, my son.

176
00:16:08,901 --> 00:16:11,836
I begged him not to join the army...

177
00:16:12,004 --> 00:16:13,494
...but he went anyway.

178
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,505
Thirty-seven years he's been away.

179
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,107
You've been alone for 37 years...

180
00:16:23,048 --> 00:16:26,575
...never smiled, spoken with love,
or even hugged anyone.

181
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:32,382
Even if you don't give me a room,
there's something I want to give you.

182
00:16:33,025 --> 00:16:34,856
What do you want to give me?

183
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,490
I just want to hug you, Lilipop.

184
00:16:38,764 --> 00:16:43,758
You rascaI. He used to
call me Lilipop too.

185
00:16:47,873 --> 00:16:49,397
Do you want to hug me?

186
00:16:50,209 --> 00:16:52,541
You need to be hugged, Lilipop.

187
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,242
That night, Lilian found a son...

188
00:17:26,412 --> 00:17:28,471
...the off-key piano finally
found the right key...

189
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,673
...and women like us,
we found a true friend.

190
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:33,613
We could call him our own...

191
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,619
...but for him, there was no one.

192
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,279
If there was anything,
it was simply destiny...

193
00:17:38,457 --> 00:17:40,982
...that eventually favored him
one night.

194
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:05,016
Hello.

195
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:10,186
Madam, it's not raining,
why is your umbrella...?

196
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:12,718
Oh, you're crying?

197
00:18:13,325 --> 00:18:16,158
Look here, madam, please don't cry.

198
00:18:16,328 --> 00:18:18,057
I feeI terrible when someone cries.

199
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,892
You can leave your umbrella open
if you like, no problem.

200
00:18:24,736 --> 00:18:26,761
Raj, you're so stupid.

201
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,972
Sorry, madam, I-

202
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:33,233
Hello?

203
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:37,672
Hello?

204
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,378
Where did she disappear?

205
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,648
Madam!

206
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,830
Madam, are you all right?

207
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,262
Do you need any help?

208
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:59,336
No, I don't.
Please stop following me.

209
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:02,531
Following you?
No way, I'm just trying to help you.

210
00:19:03,609 --> 00:19:05,634
Damn, what's this world coming to?

211
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:09,406
If you need me,
I'm right here by this cafe.

212
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,014
Okay?

213
00:19:26,865 --> 00:19:32,326
You are a still moonlight

214
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:38,807
Some delicacy or some angel

215
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:45,314
You are captivating
You are enchanting

216
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:50,717
Or some god's gift

217
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:57,226
Gosh, so beautiful
Gosh, so beautiful

218
00:19:57,796 --> 00:20:01,254
Gosh, so beautiful

219
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:07,734
You are a still moonlight

220
00:20:07,906 --> 00:20:14,106
Some delicacy or some angel

221
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:20,377
You are captivating
You are enchanting

222
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:26,351
Or some god's gift

223
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:32,828
Gosh, so beautiful
Gosh, so beautiful

224
00:20:32,998 --> 00:20:36,695
Gosh, so beautiful

225
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:36,889
You are shyness
You are happiness

226
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:44,229
You are faith
You are intoxication

227
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:50,772
Silent eyes, like a plea

228
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:56,505
Your speech, like a prayer

229
00:21:56,748 --> 00:22:00,309
You are present everywhere

230
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:05,184
Yet still remain so far away

231
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:12,127
Gosh, so beautiful
Gosh, so beautiful

232
00:22:12,297 --> 00:22:15,960
Gosh, so beautiful

233
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:56,138
Excuse me. Can I drop you home?

234
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,366
Look, I don't even know you.

235
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:03,605
Listen, I don't know you either,
but I feeI it's my duty to drop you.

236
00:23:03,782 --> 00:23:06,376
Who knows what could happen?

237
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:11,188
Don't take the trouble, I'll manage.

238
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:15,019
It's no trouble.
It would be my honor to drop you.

239
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,161
No, thank you.

240
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:29,098
Listen!

241
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:32,567
Hope you didn't think
I'm one of those drunkards?

242
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:37,113
Yes, that did cross my mind, when
you were staring at me on the bridge.

243
00:23:37,282 --> 00:23:39,250
No, no. Don't get me wrong.

244
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:42,819
- Looking at you I simply thought-
- Thought what?

245
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,751
What did you think?

246
00:23:45,056 --> 00:23:47,752
That I'm one of those women
that get out at night to...

247
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:52,529
No, no, madam, you're wrong again.

248
00:23:52,697 --> 00:23:54,995
I never thought of you that way.

249
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:58,402
Look, you were crying...

250
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:02,631
...and I felt I should help you.
But you obviously didn't realize that.

251
00:24:23,762 --> 00:24:26,890
Come on, let me drop you home.

252
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:42,808
What were you doing alone,
crying on the bridge?

253
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:46,048
I live nearby here.

254
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,587
Is that why you were crying?
I live nearby too, but I don't cry.

255
00:24:50,755 --> 00:24:54,088
I must say, madam,
you're very funny.

256
00:24:56,328 --> 00:25:00,059
See, there are no roads
without potholes...

257
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:02,097
...and no life without
problems and sorrows.

258
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,071
Hey! Why are you
touching my feet?

259
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,812
Oh, you dropped your anklet.

260
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:03,860
See, you look much better
when you smile.

261
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,429
It's unfair to see you so sad.

262
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,799
No, actually sadness
suits you just fine.

263
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:14,432
Let me tell you one thing,
sorrow is inevitable.

264
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,166
I'm telling you.
It creeps into everyone's life.

265
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:21,912
But don't worry,
I know a way to fight it.

266
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,703
It's a secret.

267
00:26:23,882 --> 00:26:26,680
Pretend life is a boxing ring...

268
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,910
...and unhappiness your opponent.

269
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:33,984
It has countless hands,
but you have two.

270
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:35,990
If it appears before you,
don't be afraid.

271
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,789
Look straight into its eyes...

272
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:43,298
...understand and gauge its strength,
and then...

273
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:50,565
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the fight of the century.

274
00:26:50,742 --> 00:26:54,041
On one corner is a beautifuI young
lady, and on one is unhappiness.

275
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,009
And the crowd goes mad.

276
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,274
But don't forget...

277
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:01,551
...unhappiness is
a very strong opponent.

278
00:27:02,654 --> 00:27:04,519
Now start fighting.

279
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:08,286
Move. Bounce.

280
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,394
It will first get you in the face.

281
00:27:12,831 --> 00:27:16,392
You'll be hurt.
No worries, keep fighting.

282
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,526
With the next hit, you will fall.

283
00:27:18,703 --> 00:27:20,830
But the trick is to stand up
and face me.

284
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:23,804
Because if you give up
by the third round...

285
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,102
...then every punch will fill
your eyes with tears...

286
00:27:26,277 --> 00:27:27,835
...every jab will steaI
the smile from your lips.

287
00:27:28,013 --> 00:27:29,503
By the fifth round,
it'll force its way into your home...

288
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:30,773
...and snatch away all happiness.

289
00:27:30,949 --> 00:27:34,817
By the sixth round,
everything you love will be finished.

290
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:39,855
It will be a totaI knockout! The winner
will be unhappiness! Yes! Yes! Yes!

291
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,706
Though you're happy, there's still
a glint of sadness in your eyes.

292
00:28:03,882 --> 00:28:07,818
But happiness suits you well too.

293
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,784
That's my house.

294
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,118
Your house is so beautifuI.

295
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:51,785
It's too bad we got here so soon.

296
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:54,488
Wish you lived a little further away.

297
00:28:57,502 --> 00:28:59,970
Wish we'd be together
a little longer-

298
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,007
And wish this rain hadn't stopped...

299
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,415
...so we could stay under
this umbrella forever.

300
00:29:30,468 --> 00:29:31,901
Ranbir Raj.

301
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,765
You can call me Raj.

302
00:29:36,007 --> 00:29:37,167
And you are?

303
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,648
Just a minute, stay where you are!

304
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:55,358
What's your problem?
Aren't we friends now?

305
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:57,859
You still won't tell me your name!

306
00:29:58,229 --> 00:30:01,323
You refused my hand five times
in this meeting.

307
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:04,935
If I guess your name
in the next five seconds...

308
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,162
...you will have to shake my hand.

309
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,401
if I can't, you'll never see me again.

310
00:30:10,575 --> 00:30:12,099
One.

311
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:15,945
Two.

312
00:30:17,048 --> 00:30:18,072
Three.

313
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:19,978
Sakina!

314
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:25,045
It's nearly midnight. Come inside!

315
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,151
You are Sakina.

316
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:33,894
If Grandma finds out,
you're going to be miserable all Eid.

317
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:37,057
- Yes, Jhumri Aapa, I'm coming.
- Come quickly.

318
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:56,447
- Will we meet again tomorrow night?
- Who knows...

319
00:30:57,555 --> 00:31:00,649
- ... what will happen tomorrow?
- What will happen tomorrow?

320
00:31:00,825 --> 00:31:03,259
If the moon appears tomorrow,
it will be Eid...

321
00:31:04,128 --> 00:31:06,562
...or else I will be waiting for you.

322
00:31:09,167 --> 00:31:10,896
Goodbye.

323
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,120
Sakina.

324
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,385
Sakina.

325
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:54,470
Sakina.

326
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:15,690
Sakina.

327
00:32:48,733 --> 00:32:57,232
Since your eyes met mine

328
00:32:57,775 --> 00:33:05,910
Since your eyes met mine

329
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:09,482
Been like a dazed fool

330
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,555
Been like a detached fool

331
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:17,388
The Almighty seems dazed too

332
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:23,863
The Almighty seems dazed too

333
00:33:24,702 --> 00:33:34,407
Since your eyes met mine

334
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:17,083
Since I got a sign from you

335
00:34:17,255 --> 00:34:23,091
I've been so very restless

336
00:34:23,261 --> 00:34:29,029
Since I got a sign from you

337
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,500
I've been so very restless

338
00:34:33,771 --> 00:34:39,539
Since you whispered to me

339
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:45,307
I've lost all senses totally

340
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:54,622
Since our hearts connected

341
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:57,420
Been like a dazed fool

342
00:34:57,595 --> 00:35:00,792
Been like a detached fool

343
00:35:00,965 --> 00:35:06,301
The Almighty seems dazed too

344
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:12,676
The Almighty seems dazed too

345
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:22,412
Since your eyes met mine

346
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,725
Raj!

347
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:40,793
Raj, get up, you idiot!
How can you sleep like this?

348
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:43,372
It's you, Lilipop.

349
00:35:43,774 --> 00:35:45,366
Good morning, my sweetie.

350
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,943
I waited the whole night for you...

351
00:35:48,112 --> 00:35:50,137
...and you snuck up
from the window again...

352
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:53,681
- ... and fell asleep on the piano, idiot!
- Your idiot is in love.

353
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,115
What did you say?

354
00:35:56,521 --> 00:35:58,318
Your idiot is in love, Lilipop.

355
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:01,185
Hey, where's the whiskey?

356
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:05,352
Finally, God has been kind
to this fooI.

357
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,896
Extremely kind, Lilipop.

358
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,058
What's her name?

359
00:36:12,203 --> 00:36:13,465
Sakina.

360
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:18,132
Sakina, what a beautifuI name.

361
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:19,835
How does she look?

362
00:36:21,245 --> 00:36:23,338
She's a beauty, Lilipop.

363
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,448
She's like a grand piano,
like a violin...

364
00:36:25,616 --> 00:36:27,777
...like a trumpet, like a saxophone,
like a guitar!

365
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,580
Is this a girI or an orchestra?

366
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,915
Lilipop, don't act smart.

367
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,684
So when do I get to meet her?

368
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,455
I'll meet her tonight
and tell her how I feeI...

369
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,531
...then she will be mine
and I'll introduce her to you.

370
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,228
I hope you don't mind.

371
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:48,096
If it were my son, Vincent,
would I mind?

372
00:36:51,676 --> 00:36:55,544
Will you leave me and go away
once you're married?

373
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,144
If it were Vincent,
would he leave you?

374
00:37:00,017 --> 00:37:01,848
He did.

375
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,452
But this is Raj,
who will never leave you.

376
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:15,427
You know, Raj, I feeI like singing.

377
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,160
Of course, of course.

378
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,429
The flowers that bloom in the spring
Tra-la

379
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,007
Have nothing to do with the case

380
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:27,474
For I have under my wing
Tra-la

381
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:30,239
The most preposterous thing
Tra-la

382
00:37:30,414 --> 00:37:32,905
With a caricature of a face
Tra-la

383
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,552
With a caricature of a face

384
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,188
Bravo, bravo, bravo!

385
00:37:38,356 --> 00:37:40,586
And now I am going to sing
another song.

386
00:37:45,796 --> 00:37:48,629
- Good evening, Mr. D'Costa.
- Good evening.

387
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,762
- What's this?
- Leave application.

388
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,528
Leave application?

389
00:37:53,971 --> 00:37:56,166
I won't be able to sing tonight.

390
00:37:56,807 --> 00:37:58,638
Why not?

391
00:37:58,809 --> 00:38:00,902
You see, sir, I have someone
waiting for me...

392
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:04,047
...and it's cruciaI I meet this person.
Sir, I am so excited.

393
00:38:04,348 --> 00:38:07,146
What about all these people
waiting for you to sing?

394
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:10,310
Sir, don't worry, I'll personally
apologize to each of them.

395
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,889
I'm not my usuaI self today.
I really have to go.

396
00:38:14,058 --> 00:38:16,458
Hold it.
You're not going anywhere tonight.

397
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,185
Sir, please.

398
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,987
You will perform as long
as the audience wants you to.

399
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,861
Got it?

400
00:38:26,237 --> 00:38:28,000
Then I'm sorry, sir...

401
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,503
...I resign.

402
00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,601
Success already gone
to your head?

403
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,972
A handfuI of people applaud you...

404
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,704
...and it's gone to your head.

405
00:38:37,081 --> 00:38:39,015
If you don't sing tonight...

406
00:38:39,183 --> 00:38:40,878
...you're out for good.

407
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,417
Think about it.

408
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:48,654
You're in some hurry, Saawariya.

409
00:38:50,194 --> 00:38:52,355
Sakina sure is a lucky girI...

410
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:55,294
...to have an admirer like you.

411
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,926
You know Sakina?

412
00:38:58,102 --> 00:39:00,900
I am the princess of the streets.

413
00:39:01,072 --> 00:39:04,872
Take a step and I'll tell you how
the rest of your journey will be.

414
00:39:05,576 --> 00:39:08,010
This is the path of love...

415
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,704
...so beware how you tread.

416
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:16,249
Listen.

417
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,650
Don't ever love someone so much...

418
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,383
...that you begin to hate
yourself one day.

419
00:39:23,594 --> 00:39:25,425
Well said, Gulabji.

420
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,160
You must be really stupid...

421
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,234
...to want to quit a job like this.

422
00:39:32,503 --> 00:39:33,936
Want?

423
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,902
I want something else...

424
00:39:36,073 --> 00:39:40,237
...and for her,
I'm willing to forsake everything.

425
00:39:42,246 --> 00:39:44,077
Very impressive.

426
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,978
Just remember,
you'll never get this chance again.

427
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:49,312
Strike the iron while it's hot, my boy.

428
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:13,737
Sakina!

429
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,816
Sakina!

430
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:30,953
Hey, don't act smart, okay?

431
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,095
What's your problem?

432
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:36,765
Okay, bye! I'm leaving.

433
00:40:43,374 --> 00:40:44,773
What's this about?

434
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:50,870
Sakina!

435
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,950
Sakina, Sakina, Sakina.

436
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,820
I'm seeing you after ages.

437
00:41:02,993 --> 00:41:06,156
Where are you heading
alone so late?

438
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,264
Your grandma won't
worry about you?

439
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:10,957
My child, the world is not
a safe place anymore.

440
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,228
It's been raining heavily,
Khalajaan...

441
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,338
...and so much work to do for Eid...

442
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:18,202
...so I had to leave this late.

443
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,811
Sakina, everything came
at the same time this year.

444
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,539
Today are the Friday prayers,
tomorrow Eid...

445
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,081
...and this bad weather
to add to the chaos.

446
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,378
And our friendship too.

447
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,555
Do you know him?

448
00:41:32,723 --> 00:41:36,215
- Sure, we're-
- No, I don't. He's a stranger.

449
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,122
Stranger?

450
00:41:38,529 --> 00:41:40,121
God help us.

451
00:41:40,297 --> 00:41:43,698
Can't two women
talk in peace anymore?

452
00:41:43,868 --> 00:41:47,861
You scoundreI, eavesdropping
on women's conversation.

453
00:41:48,405 --> 00:41:51,340
Didn't I tell you that the world
is not a safe place anymore?

454
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:55,639
Come on, we'll finish our
conversation somewhere else.

455
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,907
Okay, tell me,
how is Nabeela Aapa?

456
00:42:11,395 --> 00:42:12,953
Listen...

457
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:16,894
- ... will you please hear me out, Raj?
- Ranbir Raj, okay?

458
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:21,094
I'm some stranger, remember? And a
scoundreI to some people. So please.

459
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:24,972
Please forgive me, Ranbir Raj.
But you misunderstood me.

460
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,666
How's that?

461
00:42:26,844 --> 00:42:30,007
If you didn't like meeting me,
you could have said so yesterday.

462
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,478
I would have forgotten you
like a beautifuI dream.

463
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,609
And if I had spoken to you...

464
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:37,015
...Khalajaan would have
told everyone at home.

465
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,985
It would've become difficult
for me to leave home.

466
00:42:40,424 --> 00:42:43,359
Then our friendship
would've lasted only a night.

467
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:45,757
Friendship, my yo-yo!

468
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,625
Do you even know what it means?

469
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:49,925
I yelled out for you earlier.

470
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,193
- And I heard you.
- And you still walked away?

471
00:42:52,369 --> 00:42:55,805
I was afraid of what
you would think about me.

472
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,874
Just met this girI a night ago...

473
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:01,603
...and she's already
gotten so friendly.

474
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,739
That's good...

475
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,714
...good thinking.

476
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,350
You pick and choose
your friendship...

477
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:12,784
...and make your own rules
only to break them.

478
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,085
You forget friends once
the moment passes, not me.

479
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,491
And there's one thing I really
admire about you.

480
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:22,393
Even before the day was out,
you changed colors.

481
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,364
A friend last night,
a stranger the next morning.

482
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:28,528
And I swear, I swear, I swear, madam,
it would've been much better...

483
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:31,368
...if I had waited for a blue moon
to appear than for your friendship.

484
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:33,703
Have you understood? I guess not!

485
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,081
Oh, my God.

486
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:41,976
You speak so well.

487
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:55,794
Listen, Raj.

488
00:43:57,434 --> 00:44:00,995
Sorry, the shop's closed,
please come tomorrow.

489
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,939
Look, I'm warning you,
I'm a very dangerous man.

490
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:05,803
Okay, I'm really sorry.

491
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,068
You don't have to-

492
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:11,772
You may not have forgiven me,
but I have.

493
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:21,080
- Please listen to me-
- Don't follow me!

494
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,189
Sorry, we're closed.

495
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:34,670
What?

496
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,664
Look, don't you dare laugh now.

497
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:42,577
Sakina, Sakina, Sakina!

498
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,043
Stop!

499
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,944
What are you doing? Let me go.

500
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,019
Why should I? I'm a scoundreI.

501
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:54,453
Raj, I don't like this behavior.
Let me go!

502
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,217
And a rogue too.

503
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,458
And unruly.

504
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,462
Forgive me.

505
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,936
And a little stupid.

506
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,844
Leave my hand.
Raj, someone will see us!

507
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,547
Where are you taking me?

508
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,869
- Where have you brought me?
- Oh, I love this place, Sakina.

509
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:42,403
I come here when I'm really happy.

510
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:44,302
Or...

511
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,304
...if I'm really sad.

512
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,692
The world looks so beautifuI
from up here.

513
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,293
Not as beautifuI as you.

514
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,660
Really.

515
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:13,968
What are you doing? Leave me.

516
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:18,097
- Leave you? Fine.
- No, no, I will die! Oh, God!

517
00:46:22,379 --> 00:46:24,074
Are you okay?

518
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,649
Sakina, I was just joking.

519
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,885
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

520
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,425
You really scared me.

521
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,723
Is this your idea of a joke?

522
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:48,400
I thought about you all night.

523
00:46:49,206 --> 00:46:50,867
You must have
thought about me too?

524
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:54,875
Why would I?
I don't even know you.

525
00:46:55,045 --> 00:46:57,411
Don't know me?
You know my name.

526
00:46:57,581 --> 00:47:00,072
You even know that
I'm the lead singer at the RK Bar.

527
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:03,913
I have no family besides Lilianji.

528
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:07,488
And address,
if you come with me, I'll show you.

529
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:10,621
See, I've told you all about me.

530
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:11,920
Now it's your turn.

531
00:47:14,064 --> 00:47:15,622
Come on.

532
00:47:16,233 --> 00:47:19,066
My name and address,
you found out last night.

533
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,101
Work, I weave carpets.

534
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,035
Family, just Grandma and I...

535
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:25,937
...and our caretaker, Jhumri Aapa.

536
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:28,278
And your parents?

537
00:47:30,113 --> 00:47:32,877
Grandma says Father went away.

538
00:47:34,117 --> 00:47:37,575
Where? No one knows.

539
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:44,419
And Mother waited for him
with anticipation...

540
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,660
...untiI the very end.

541
00:47:54,938 --> 00:47:57,839
That's it.

542
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:00,508
You know what, Sakina?

543
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:02,838
When God takes everything
away from us...

544
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:05,846
...in return he sends someone
to take care of us...

545
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:09,213
- ... like Lilipop for me.
- And Grandma for me.

546
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:11,811
Raj.

547
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,150
Rubbish.

548
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:16,749
Hey, Sakina.

549
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,127
Grandma does love you, right?

550
00:48:21,298 --> 00:48:22,959
Yes, a lot.

551
00:48:23,133 --> 00:48:24,430
But she's a little strict.

552
00:48:24,601 --> 00:48:27,069
She keeps me pinned to her
with a huge safety pin.

553
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:29,137
Safety pin?

554
00:48:29,306 --> 00:48:31,365
Who'd do something like that?

555
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,509
Stop making up stories, Sakina.

556
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,668
Grandma can't see very well.

557
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:39,680
She's afraid I will leave her,
like my parents did.

558
00:48:39,850 --> 00:48:42,410
That's why she keeps me pinned
to her side all the time.

559
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:46,545
If she kept you pinned,
you wouldn't be here at this hour.

560
00:48:46,723 --> 00:48:49,556
I've left someone else
pinned in my place.

561
00:48:49,726 --> 00:48:51,421
Do you understand?

562
00:48:51,828 --> 00:48:54,126
Jhumri? Correct?

563
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:59,291
That means Grandma isn't strict.
It is you who is disobedient.

564
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,333
Come, let's go get a cup of coffee.

565
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:05,967
What happened?

566
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,174
Raj, I can't come with you.

567
00:49:09,346 --> 00:49:10,779
Why can't you come?

568
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:12,279
I need to go to the bridge.

569
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:14,710
The bridge?

570
00:49:14,885 --> 00:49:16,147
I'm waiting for someone.

571
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,220
Who are you waiting for, Sakina?

572
00:49:18,388 --> 00:49:20,822
Someone speciaI.

573
00:49:22,526 --> 00:49:25,120
SpeciaI? Who?

574
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,527
Someone who I love dearly.

575
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:38,171
What happened?
Why are you so quiet?

576
00:49:39,876 --> 00:49:41,241
No, nothing.

577
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:42,878
May I know his name?

578
00:49:43,046 --> 00:49:45,037
I can't say his name.

579
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,807
It is said that by speaking
his name aloud...

580
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:48,508
...the person's life becomes shorter.

581
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,753
Why don't you
write his name instead?

582
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:00,418
Raj?

583
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:02,565
Not Raj, Imaan.

584
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:06,398
Oh, God.
You made me say his name.

585
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:08,731
You are really wicked.

586
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:15,607
You know, Raj, we were
in such a bad state financially...

587
00:50:15,779 --> 00:50:18,304
...that we were forced to rent out
the extra room.

588
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,418
I can still remember that night.

589
00:50:22,986 --> 00:50:25,819
The entire town was asleep...

590
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:28,250
...when a sudden knock
on the door woke us up.

591
00:50:31,661 --> 00:50:33,128
Grandma.

592
00:50:33,930 --> 00:50:36,023
Grandma, someone's knocking
on the door.

593
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,667
Must be the new tenant,
go wake Jhumri.

594
00:50:38,835 --> 00:50:40,268
Okay.

595
00:51:38,895 --> 00:51:40,522
Salaam.

596
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:44,627
Imaan.

597
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,700
We have a lifetime
to gaze at each other.

598
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:55,472
Shall we go in?

599
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,383
Sakina, what does this
paying guest look like?

600
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,491
Ugly, like a drenched cat.

601
00:52:09,659 --> 00:52:10,853
Is he from here?

602
00:52:11,027 --> 00:52:12,961
No, Grandma,
he is from out of town.

603
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:14,324
How old is he?

604
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,762
Quite young,
wouldn't be a day over 60.

605
00:52:16,933 --> 00:52:18,093
Nonsense.

606
00:52:18,268 --> 00:52:20,793
Wrinkled face, sallow eyes...

607
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,065
...and his darn coughing
kept me up all night.

608
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:26,064
God save us.

609
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,870
Jhumri? Where's Jhumri?

610
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:30,308
Yes, yes, I'm right here.

611
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,277
Better find another paying guest.

612
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,852
He's got one foot in the grave
and the other about to topple.

613
00:52:37,454 --> 00:52:40,548
- You never know how long he'll last.
- Come on now, Grandma.

614
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:45,559
Sakina, I suggest you better take
an advance from him.

615
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,094
You want me to go?

616
00:52:47,264 --> 00:52:49,994
Send Jhumri Aapa,
she's the one who got him here.

617
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:52,533
Will Jhumri do all the work?
You don't do a darn thing.

618
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:56,866
Go tell that old chap that he will
be fed only once a day.

619
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,201
And no tea. Should I say that?

620
00:52:59,376 --> 00:53:01,970
- Tell him.
- Okay, Grandma, I'll go tell him.

621
00:53:07,617 --> 00:53:11,053
Haven't you left yet?

622
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:15,051
What are you doing?
Undo the pin, you fooI!

623
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,283
Can't do a thing right.

624
00:53:16,459 --> 00:53:18,359
Does the opposite
of everything I say.

625
00:53:47,624 --> 00:53:49,182
The rent.

626
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:55,654
And I drink milk, not tea.

627
00:53:58,435 --> 00:54:02,929
Why were you showering me
with all these praises?

628
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,406
You're innocent...

629
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,041
...but not naive.

630
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,742
Have you taken a good look at me?

631
00:54:17,053 --> 00:54:19,920
You should, I'm not all that bad.

632
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:25,854
Goodbye.

633
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:35,034
"The prince suddenly appeared
in the princess's life...

634
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:39,699
...his piercing eyes
and caressing voice...

635
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:44,142
...swept her off her feet. "

636
00:54:44,314 --> 00:54:47,442
How did a prince appear
in this story?

637
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,982
He wasn't even
mentioned anywhere.

638
00:54:49,152 --> 00:54:52,918
That's what I'm wondering,
am I dreaming or is she?

639
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:55,284
Look at her standing there,
mumbling to herself.

640
00:54:55,892 --> 00:54:58,656
Dreaming of him
with these eyes wide open...

641
00:54:58,828 --> 00:55:02,457
...I began to feel the pain
of my longing.

642
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,657
I hadn't seen him for days.

643
00:55:05,368 --> 00:55:09,566
Finally breaking all barriers...

644
00:55:09,739 --> 00:55:12,572
...I ended up at his doorstep.

645
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:38,418
Good morning.

646
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,465
Do come in, Imaan Saheb.

647
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,826
Who?

648
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,235
It's our paying, Imaan Saheb.

649
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,031
Good day, Nabila Bi.

650
00:56:49,205 --> 00:56:52,106
You too, please have a seat.

651
00:56:52,275 --> 00:56:54,072
How are you?
I trust in good health?

652
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,407
God has been kind.

653
00:56:57,914 --> 00:57:00,576
Sakina, my child, come here.

654
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:05,613
Yes, Grandma.

655
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:07,950
How old did you say he was?

656
00:57:08,825 --> 00:57:10,292
How old did you say he was?

657
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,551
It's only been a few days
since I turned senile.

658
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:18,429
I must say, your voice sounds
strong for your age.

659
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,694
FeeI my body,
I've kept myself young and virile.

660
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,270
Goodness, what are you saying,
Nawab Saheb?

661
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,032
Tell me, what brings you here?

662
00:57:25,208 --> 00:57:26,937
I thought of you and came by.

663
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:30,470
So have you decided?

664
00:57:30,713 --> 00:57:31,873
About what?

665
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:35,347
Sakina, my child.
You haven't told her yet.

666
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:38,119
What have you forgotten now?

667
00:57:39,055 --> 00:57:41,319
Not a big deaI, Nabbo Bi.

668
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:46,326
There's a screening of the classic
film Mughal-e-Azam near the river.

669
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:49,124
It would be nice if we go together.

670
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:54,134
Normally I don't get out much,
but if you insist, why not?

671
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,239
Will you be able to see all right?

672
00:57:57,740 --> 00:58:01,437
Keep quiet, fooI!
Who needs to see? I can listen.

673
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:05,069
There's no fear in love

674
00:58:05,248 --> 00:58:08,081
There's no fear in love

675
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:11,243
You have fallen in love
Not committed a crime

676
00:58:11,421 --> 00:58:13,082
So don't be a sissy

677
00:59:36,306 --> 00:59:40,106
But life had just begun writing
the tale of our love...

678
00:59:40,276 --> 00:59:43,837
...when destiny suddenly
ran out of words.

679
00:59:44,013 --> 00:59:46,777
The very next day
Jhumri Aapa told me...

680
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,442
...he was leaving
our house for good.

681
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,507
Sakina.

682
01:00:48,244 --> 01:00:50,212
Stop crying.

683
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:54,744
- Come on, wipe your tears.
- Sakina?

684
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:02,157
You'll always be in my heart...

685
01:01:03,426 --> 01:01:06,224
...but I can't take you with me.

686
01:01:07,964 --> 01:01:10,262
I work for the country.

687
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:15,061
Where I am going there's danger...

688
01:01:15,772 --> 01:01:18,366
...and relationships are a weakness.

689
01:01:19,208 --> 01:01:21,938
I want you to be my strength...

690
01:01:22,578 --> 01:01:25,069
...and you'd rather be
my weakness?

691
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:30,244
Sakina?

692
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:35,116
I will miss you a lot.

693
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:42,089
I will miss you whenever I see
someone reading a book...

694
01:01:42,265 --> 01:01:46,793
...whenever someone
screams hysterically...

695
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:49,665
...or whenever someone
laughs while crying...

696
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:52,034
...or cries while laughing...

697
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:54,939
...I will miss you.

698
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,662
That night as we parted ways...

699
01:02:18,835 --> 01:02:21,303
...he promised he'd return...

700
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:28,070
...a year later on the night of Eid
at this bridge.

701
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:33,249
Since then, I've been anxiously
waiting for him and the night of Eid.

702
01:02:34,784 --> 01:02:37,878
- What is this?
- A token of his promise.

703
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:43,917
That night, he gave me this
before he left.

704
01:02:45,294 --> 01:02:47,285
Your token is fake...

705
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,295
...and so is your story.

706
01:02:50,466 --> 01:02:52,593
This is not a story, it's the truth.

707
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,396
I don't believe it, Sakina.

708
01:02:55,004 --> 01:02:57,598
You mean to tell me
that you're in love with a man...

709
01:02:57,774 --> 01:03:00,242
...who shows up one rainy day...

710
01:03:00,409 --> 01:03:02,639
...and disappears into the mist
the next.

711
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,012
Do you even know what
he does for a living?

712
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,842
- No.
- Where does he live?

713
01:03:07,016 --> 01:03:09,849
- I don't know.
- He must surely have an address?

714
01:03:10,019 --> 01:03:11,111
I don't know anything.

715
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,482
So obviously, you don't know
where he's gone?

716
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:16,056
What relevance do these questions
have with my love?

717
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:20,924
They do. How do you expect a man
with no address to take care of you?

718
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:22,564
Has he even written to you
this past year?

719
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:25,223
Going to take care.

720
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:29,770
The only token he's left you with
is sorrow and loneliness.

721
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:31,997
These are false promises.

722
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:40,747
Wow, my lucky day.

723
01:03:40,917 --> 01:03:43,579
Money rolling in
without having to sweat for it.

724
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:46,051
Listen, that's mine!

725
01:03:46,222 --> 01:03:47,587
But I found it on the street.

726
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,748
Please, give me back my coin.

727
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,725
Yours? But I don't see
your name on it.

728
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,297
Look, I don't argue with
women like you...

729
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:59,093
...just return my coin.

730
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:03,269
Why are decent people like you
so afraid to even take our names?

731
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,701
All right! What's your name?

732
01:04:07,376 --> 01:04:10,675
The name doesn't matter,
it's the price that matters.

733
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,007
Gulabji...

734
01:04:13,983 --> 01:04:16,178
- ... please return that coin.
- You know her?

735
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:18,786
Of course. We're neighbors...

736
01:04:18,955 --> 01:04:21,185
...aren't we, Saawariya?

737
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,325
Stop teasing her
and give the coin back.

738
01:04:23,492 --> 01:04:26,120
If you insist, I'd give my life.

739
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:28,820
The coin is nothing.

740
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,164
Why did you do this?

741
01:04:33,135 --> 01:04:34,602
Let her go!

742
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:36,203
Let her realize...

743
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:38,704
...how much you love her.

744
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,706
Just one meeting and you've been...

745
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:44,870
...writing her name on every wall
and every stone in this town.

746
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,514
Let her realize that in love...

747
01:04:46,682 --> 01:04:49,742
...sometimes stones are
more valuable than coins.

748
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,352
Raj!

749
01:04:52,154 --> 01:04:54,054
Come here quick!

750
01:04:58,794 --> 01:05:00,523
Raj!

751
01:05:01,998 --> 01:05:04,523
- What happened, Sakina?
- You said he won't come, right?

752
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:07,225
Look at this.
He's written my name all over.

753
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:09,030
It means he's here.

754
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,602
If he's arrived, then why
hasn't he come to see you?

755
01:05:16,145 --> 01:05:18,511
Maybe he is testing my love.

756
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,916
Maybe he's hiding here
and watching me.

757
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:27,385
Oh, God. He loves me so much.

758
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:36,094
Look at this token, Ranbir Raj...

759
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:40,626
...it symbolizes faith and true love.

760
01:05:41,070 --> 01:05:45,564
And you'll see,
he will fulfill his promise.

761
01:05:47,343 --> 01:05:49,243
Didn't I tell you?

762
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:52,347
He'll come and take me away?

763
01:05:52,515 --> 01:05:54,642
Stop it, Sakina!
You'll catch a cold and fall sick.

764
01:05:54,817 --> 01:05:57,718
Sick? I am already lovesick!

765
01:05:57,887 --> 01:06:00,447
You've gone crazy. You laugh and
then suddenly break down and cry.

766
01:06:00,623 --> 01:06:03,057
Come on, Sakina, let's go!

767
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:19,236
Can I say something?

768
01:06:19,408 --> 01:06:20,932
Tell me.

769
01:06:21,344 --> 01:06:23,141
I really-

770
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:28,144
This darn rain. God!

771
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,080
It's tough to get home.

772
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,083
Isn't it, young lady?

773
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:49,131
So do you think it will
stop raining tonight?

774
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:59,805
In the rain, you saw me

775
01:06:59,982 --> 01:07:05,750
My love, I saw you in the rain

776
01:07:13,162 --> 01:07:16,996
Raj, do you consider me
your friend?

777
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:20,499
- Yes.
- So tell me, what should I do?

778
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,162
About what?

779
01:07:23,339 --> 01:07:25,034
Imaan?

780
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:27,839
You can't take his name
or even ask about him?

781
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:31,446
- But you can write to him, can't you?
- You mean a letter?

782
01:07:31,614 --> 01:07:33,411
We can try?

783
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,675
We sure can do this...

784
01:07:35,851 --> 01:07:39,116
...but he shouldn't feeI
I'm imposing myself on him.

785
01:07:40,823 --> 01:07:44,122
You wait up for him every night,
cry on the slightest excuse.

786
01:07:44,293 --> 01:07:47,421
It's better you do something about this
rather than suffering in silence.

787
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:50,127
If you insist, I will try to do this.

788
01:07:53,702 --> 01:07:55,693
If you were in my place
what would you write?

789
01:07:55,871 --> 01:07:57,862
- I would swear at him.
- I will too.

790
01:07:58,040 --> 01:08:00,907
- You?
- Yes, me. But you start.

791
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:05,508
I'd write, "You silly man,
don't bother returning...

792
01:08:05,681 --> 01:08:09,173
...I am now in love with a nice
talented young man named Raj. "

793
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:15,152
Told you so,
you always interrupt me.

794
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:17,816
Let's start like this:

795
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,755
"I have only desired you
with a pure heart. "

796
01:08:20,930 --> 01:08:22,955
I was also going to write this.

797
01:08:23,365 --> 01:08:27,665
Okay. So assume what you were
going to write, I have already written it.

798
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:31,096
- Should we swear at him now?
- He won't feeI bad, right?

799
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,798
If you send this
with a genuine heart, he won't.

800
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:35,434
With faith?

801
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:39,475
Yes. I guess so.

802
01:08:57,833 --> 01:09:02,202
You are a little roguish

803
01:09:02,705 --> 01:09:06,937
You are a little innocent

804
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:11,479
You are a little roguish

805
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:16,512
You are a little innocent

806
01:09:17,086 --> 01:09:21,386
But this is the fact too

807
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:26,824
You're my whole world

808
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,955
You are a little roguish

809
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:35,566
You are a little innocent

810
01:09:36,038 --> 01:09:40,566
But this is the fact too

811
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:46,281
You're my whole world

812
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:12,136
You tantalize my breath

813
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:19,339
You are my adornment

814
01:10:19,515 --> 01:10:26,478
You are my longing

815
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:35,994
My conscience, my grace, my honor

816
01:10:36,332 --> 01:10:41,099
You are a little mischievous

817
01:10:41,270 --> 01:10:45,798
You are a little naughty

818
01:10:45,975 --> 01:10:50,571
You are a little mischievous

819
01:10:50,746 --> 01:10:55,012
You are a little naughty

820
01:10:55,484 --> 01:11:05,120
But this is the fact too
you are my everything

821
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:08,354
You

822
01:11:10,633 --> 01:11:14,694
Innocent

823
01:11:38,961 --> 01:11:40,952
Rogue.

824
01:11:43,399 --> 01:11:46,229
I just asked you for one favor
and you didn't do it.

825
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,563
You call yourself a friend?

826
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:52,639
Don't worry,
I've memorized the entire letter.

827
01:11:52,808 --> 01:11:56,471
Tomorrow I'll neatly write it for you.
You simply go and post it.

828
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:59,011
Liar. You're such a liar.

829
01:11:59,181 --> 01:12:01,775
In any case, tomorrow will be
the last night of our friendship.

830
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:05,852
Eventually when I leave with him,
I know you'll feeI sad.

831
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:09,354
Thank God. At least you've given
my feelings some thought.

832
01:12:09,525 --> 01:12:12,653
For the last two nights,
it's only been you and your sad story.

833
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,262
Do you have some problems too?

834
01:12:15,431 --> 01:12:17,331
Well, not really...

835
01:12:17,499 --> 01:12:22,368
...but you never know,
I could have some tomorrow.

836
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:28,035
Well, can I bother you
with something?

837
01:12:28,210 --> 01:12:29,575
What?

838
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:36,240
This letter?

839
01:12:36,418 --> 01:12:37,851
Yes, I wrote it for him.

840
01:12:40,055 --> 01:12:42,683
Sakina, if you'd already written one
then why did you ask me?

841
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:46,692
Well, just to make sure
what I've written is all right.

842
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:51,299
But what you were thinking
is exactly what I've written.

843
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,863
You will deliver this letter for me,
won't you?

844
01:12:55,204 --> 01:12:57,069
I knew you wouldn't turn me down.

845
01:12:57,906 --> 01:13:03,037
Jhumri told me that he is staying at
the Momin Lodge in the old city.

846
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:06,306
I know it's pretty far away...

847
01:13:06,749 --> 01:13:08,148
...but will you please do it?

848
01:13:09,752 --> 01:13:11,447
Raj, I have to leave now.

849
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:15,522
God forbid, if Grandma wakes up
then I'll be in trouble.

850
01:13:15,691 --> 01:13:17,249
Wait, Sakina! I'll walk you home.

851
01:13:17,426 --> 01:13:21,021
No, Raj, I'll go by myself.
Please just deliver my letter. Okay?

852
01:13:21,196 --> 01:13:22,823
But, Sakina, will we meet tomorrow?

853
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:25,626
If you come back with a reply,
then I sure will.

854
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:27,632
Hey, but what if I don't get a reply?

855
01:13:27,803 --> 01:13:30,169
Then I'll harass you even more.

856
01:13:30,339 --> 01:13:33,797
Now, don't forget to deliver
my letter, okay?

857
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:36,675
- And, Raj?
- What?

858
01:13:36,845 --> 01:13:38,540
Oh, nothing, nothing.

859
01:13:38,714 --> 01:13:41,239
I'll be waiting for you tomorrow.

860
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:43,382
Okay, bye!

861
01:13:43,552 --> 01:13:45,679
Okay, bye!

862
01:15:23,283 --> 01:15:25,979
Love can be brutal at times.

863
01:15:26,152 --> 01:15:31,681
It turns a stone to God
and an angel into stone.

864
01:15:32,659 --> 01:15:36,789
That night I saw a lover
consumed by love.

865
01:15:37,497 --> 01:15:41,263
Those two nights of romance
had unsettled him forever.

866
01:15:41,935 --> 01:15:45,462
And I feared what fate
held in store for him.

867
01:16:34,020 --> 01:16:35,715
Who is it?

868
01:16:40,660 --> 01:16:44,494
No rest for the deviI.
They won't leave you alone.

869
01:16:44,664 --> 01:16:47,064
They just keep knocking at it.

870
01:16:47,233 --> 01:16:48,757
You?!

871
01:16:48,935 --> 01:16:51,062
Hi, darling, how you?

872
01:16:51,538 --> 01:16:54,063
Not "how you," it's "how are you?"

873
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:55,537
How did you get in here?

874
01:16:55,742 --> 01:17:00,873
Using my feet, walking.

875
01:17:01,047 --> 01:17:02,605
Walk.

876
01:17:02,782 --> 01:17:05,512
Come on, get out of here!

877
01:17:10,824 --> 01:17:13,122
I've come to meet my Saawariya.

878
01:17:13,293 --> 01:17:15,693
There's no Saawariya here.

879
01:17:17,363 --> 01:17:19,228
Oh, my sweetheart...

880
01:17:19,399 --> 01:17:23,301
...of course he's here,
my Saawariya at the window.

881
01:17:23,470 --> 01:17:24,698
How do you know him?

882
01:17:25,338 --> 01:17:28,501
By heart. From my heart.

883
01:17:28,675 --> 01:17:30,643
He's not feeling well,
he won't come.

884
01:17:33,046 --> 01:17:34,741
Tell him Sakina's here...

885
01:17:34,914 --> 01:17:36,142
...he'll come running.

886
01:17:36,416 --> 01:17:37,974
Sakina?

887
01:17:38,151 --> 01:17:39,880
Your name is Sakina?

888
01:17:40,854 --> 01:17:42,481
Can't it be?

889
01:17:42,822 --> 01:17:44,949
Raj! Where are you, Raj?

890
01:17:45,125 --> 01:17:46,149
What happened?

891
01:17:46,326 --> 01:17:50,160
If she's Sakina,
then you're out of my house!

892
01:17:50,330 --> 01:17:51,820
I'm warning you.

893
01:17:51,998 --> 01:17:55,525
If this harlot comes into
this house again...

894
01:17:55,702 --> 01:17:58,296
...you will never be seen
in this town!

895
01:17:58,471 --> 01:17:59,631
Do you understand?

896
01:17:59,806 --> 01:18:02,138
Gulabji, what are you doing here?

897
01:18:02,475 --> 01:18:06,468
Your name is Gulabji?

898
01:18:06,646 --> 01:18:08,546
So you lied to me!

899
01:18:08,715 --> 01:18:12,344
My dear, If I told you the truth,
you wouldn't have called him...

900
01:18:12,519 --> 01:18:14,510
...and he wouldn't have come.

901
01:18:19,993 --> 01:18:21,893
What's the matter, Saawariya?

902
01:18:22,061 --> 01:18:26,498
You look worried since last night,
what's wrong?

903
01:18:27,634 --> 01:18:29,431
It's no big deaI.

904
01:18:29,602 --> 01:18:32,969
My visit here is also no big deaI,
just to invite you for my birthday.

905
01:18:33,139 --> 01:18:36,404
If you get a chance, drop by.

906
01:18:36,576 --> 01:18:38,771
We'll have a good time.

907
01:18:40,446 --> 01:18:43,244
I'm sure that happens every day.

908
01:18:44,150 --> 01:18:47,483
But today it's just for me, darling.

909
01:18:47,654 --> 01:18:48,678
You're invited too.

910
01:18:48,855 --> 01:18:50,254
Are you done talking?

911
01:18:50,423 --> 01:18:54,723
I'm done with him, but not with you.

912
01:18:56,729 --> 01:19:00,062
Look, darling,
you're alone and I'm alone.

913
01:19:00,233 --> 01:19:04,499
You have a house which you
turned into a guesthouse.

914
01:19:04,671 --> 01:19:09,108
I didn't have anything besides this
body, so I turned it into a guesthouse.

915
01:19:09,275 --> 01:19:14,042
Customers come to both our places.
They sleep and pay money.

916
01:19:14,514 --> 01:19:17,244
So doesn't that make you
a woman selling her wares too?

917
01:19:19,118 --> 01:19:23,111
We all do something to survive,
right, love?

918
01:19:26,092 --> 01:19:30,961
Do come. Bye, darling.

919
01:19:32,565 --> 01:19:34,692
Do come, Saawariya.

920
01:19:36,669 --> 01:19:37,829
Bitch.

921
01:19:54,354 --> 01:19:57,414
Whoever it is, tell them I'm busy.

922
01:20:02,729 --> 01:20:04,720
The chief guest is here!

923
01:20:06,666 --> 01:20:09,430
Happy birthday to you

924
01:20:09,602 --> 01:20:12,503
Happy birthday to you

925
01:20:12,672 --> 01:20:16,267
This is such a sad song.
I don't likes.

926
01:20:16,542 --> 01:20:19,636
I'm sorry to upset you
on your birthday.

927
01:20:22,548 --> 01:20:24,880
Did you really think
it's my birthday?

928
01:20:26,819 --> 01:20:28,377
My naive boy.

929
01:20:28,554 --> 01:20:31,580
It's this day that I was initiated
into the business.

930
01:20:31,758 --> 01:20:36,525
On a day that's meant to be sad,
I've used as an excuse to be happy.

931
01:20:36,696 --> 01:20:41,827
I am usually happy,
but a bit low today.

932
01:20:46,072 --> 01:20:47,403
Any problem, Gulabji?

933
01:20:49,909 --> 01:20:52,070
Last night I saw a friend
commit a sin.

934
01:20:53,980 --> 01:20:55,811
You lied to her, didn't you?

935
01:20:57,450 --> 01:21:00,146
You're such a liar.

936
01:21:03,589 --> 01:21:06,717
Now there's only one way
to make me happy.

937
01:21:09,429 --> 01:21:14,366
Go hug her, tell her how you feeI
and apologize for last night.

938
01:21:16,302 --> 01:21:21,296
I can't face her, let alone hug her.

939
01:21:22,342 --> 01:21:23,673
I just can't go, Gulabji.

940
01:21:24,243 --> 01:21:25,767
You won't go?

941
01:21:27,113 --> 01:21:30,981
Look, partner.
It's the right moment today...

942
01:21:31,150 --> 01:21:33,641
...and the perfect time
in this season of love.

943
01:21:33,820 --> 01:21:37,722
Once it passes, it won't return.

944
01:21:38,992 --> 01:21:42,655
Are you going to do something
or just keep nodding your head?

945
01:21:44,230 --> 01:21:46,460
You know,
you're really good-hearted.

946
01:21:48,868 --> 01:21:51,359
I'm sure your girI is
good-hearted too.

947
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:54,938
And if she were here,
you know what she'd say?

948
01:21:55,108 --> 01:21:56,666
What would she say?

949
01:22:07,553 --> 01:22:10,078
Mod, handsome, showy, lively

950
01:22:10,256 --> 01:22:12,781
Elegant, shapely, juicy, ardent

951
01:22:12,959 --> 01:22:15,257
Graceful attire, stubborn actor

952
01:22:15,428 --> 01:22:18,295
Tight pants, loose shirt

953
01:22:18,464 --> 01:22:22,264
Handsome, lively, stubborn

954
01:22:22,435 --> 01:22:26,201
Graceful, stubborn

955
01:22:26,372 --> 01:22:28,602
Pants are loose

956
01:22:44,357 --> 01:22:49,522
Oh, handsome
Lovely time brushes by

957
01:22:49,695 --> 01:22:54,359
Oh, handsome
Lovely time brushes by

958
01:22:54,967 --> 01:22:59,336
Listen, Jamila, stubborn guy
Burns me all over

959
01:23:11,017 --> 01:23:15,886
Oh, handsome
Lovely time brushes by

960
01:23:16,055 --> 01:23:20,185
Listen, Jamila, stubborn guy
Burns me all over

961
01:23:31,904 --> 01:23:36,500
A man so gaudy, a man so flirty

962
01:23:37,176 --> 01:23:44,878
A man so gaudy, a man so flirty
Drives me totally crazy

963
01:23:57,196 --> 01:24:01,929
Oh, handsome
Lovely time brushes by

964
01:24:20,753 --> 01:24:25,713
You are so unaware

965
01:24:26,025 --> 01:24:30,758
You are so unaware

966
01:24:30,930 --> 01:24:33,831
You are so unaware
You are so unaware

967
01:24:34,000 --> 01:24:36,400
Of what love is

968
01:24:36,569 --> 01:24:41,063
Oh, worthless
You are so unaware

969
01:24:41,908 --> 01:24:46,140
Oh, worthless, you are so unaware
Of the state of this miserable heart

970
01:24:46,312 --> 01:24:51,249
Take all riches, take all senses

971
01:24:51,417 --> 01:24:56,116
I beg of you, please
Bend to my desires

972
01:25:01,427 --> 01:25:06,660
Oh, handsome
Lovely time brushes by

973
01:25:06,832 --> 01:25:11,292
Listen, Shakila, stubborn guy
Burns me all over

974
01:25:59,785 --> 01:26:04,882
Oh, handsome
Lovely time brushes by

975
01:26:05,057 --> 01:26:09,858
Oh, handsome
Lovely time brushes by

976
01:26:10,329 --> 01:26:14,789
Listen, Ramila, stubborn guy
Burns me all over

977
01:26:28,748 --> 01:26:34,243
Mod, handsome, showy, lively
Elegant, shapely, juicy, ardent

978
01:26:36,689 --> 01:26:42,286
Graceful attire, stubborn actor
Tight pants, loose shirt

979
01:26:45,164 --> 01:26:50,329
Handsome, lively, shapely, juicy

980
01:26:53,072 --> 01:26:58,237
Graceful, stubborn
Pants are loose

981
01:27:00,746 --> 01:27:03,408
So sad and so lonely

982
01:27:12,825 --> 01:27:15,817
Sakina, where are you going?

983
01:27:17,863 --> 01:27:21,299
My child, where are you going
on this stormy night?

984
01:27:21,467 --> 01:27:24,402
You know where I am going.
You gave me the address.

985
01:27:24,570 --> 01:27:27,937
I sent a letter to that address
and I'm going to get my reply.

986
01:27:28,107 --> 01:27:30,132
What letter? What reply?

987
01:27:30,309 --> 01:27:32,709
I've had to deaI with your truancies
the last few nights.

988
01:27:32,878 --> 01:27:35,904
You take off every night,
leaving me alone, pinned to Grandma.

989
01:27:36,082 --> 01:27:40,382
But after you leave,
I cannot sleep a wink.

990
01:27:41,187 --> 01:27:44,122
For God's sake, my child,
if something were to happen to you...

991
01:27:44,290 --> 01:27:46,622
...what would I say to Grandma?

992
01:27:47,159 --> 01:27:49,320
That's it, you are not going anywhere
on this dark, stormy night.

993
01:27:49,495 --> 01:27:51,326
Come in at once!

994
01:27:56,369 --> 01:28:01,830
No darkness harms those
enlightened in love.

995
01:29:11,444 --> 01:29:13,105
Raj?

996
01:29:17,283 --> 01:29:18,841
Raj?

997
01:29:35,801 --> 01:29:37,564
Raj?

998
01:29:40,306 --> 01:29:41,898
Raj?

999
01:29:47,112 --> 01:29:50,639
For the first time
in the history of India...

1000
01:29:50,816 --> 01:29:54,081
...you are ironing
your shirt yourself?

1001
01:29:56,255 --> 01:29:58,883
And yesterday, you chose to come
from the door, not the pipe.

1002
01:30:02,228 --> 01:30:07,256
Since the last two days, you haven't
sung, boxed or bothered me.

1003
01:30:10,336 --> 01:30:12,065
Is something wrong?

1004
01:30:14,874 --> 01:30:16,432
Did you fight with Sakina?

1005
01:30:19,144 --> 01:30:20,907
A small one or big one?

1006
01:30:22,114 --> 01:30:24,344
Oh, big fight.

1007
01:30:24,517 --> 01:30:26,644
It's your fault, I know it.

1008
01:30:27,653 --> 01:30:29,553
Now go and confess to God.

1009
01:30:29,722 --> 01:30:31,212
Everything will be all right.

1010
01:30:33,692 --> 01:30:36,217
Then I would like to confess to you.

1011
01:30:39,131 --> 01:30:42,032
You know how much I love Sakina.

1012
01:30:46,872 --> 01:30:48,271
And I deceived her.

1013
01:30:50,409 --> 01:30:53,503
For the last year,
she's been waiting for someone else.

1014
01:30:54,280 --> 01:30:57,408
And the other night she gave me
a letter addressed to that man.

1015
01:31:00,019 --> 01:31:01,350
I burnt that letter.

1016
01:31:01,754 --> 01:31:06,088
Burning the letter, that is your sin...

1017
01:31:06,258 --> 01:31:08,726
...but repentance...

1018
01:31:08,894 --> 01:31:13,763
...that is your pure souI.

1019
01:31:14,667 --> 01:31:15,895
What should I do?

1020
01:31:16,068 --> 01:31:19,435
Go find that man and instead of
the letter give him the message.

1021
01:31:19,605 --> 01:31:21,470
And then leave everything to God.

1022
01:31:22,341 --> 01:31:26,004
But I don't want to lose her, Lilipop.

1023
01:31:26,745 --> 01:31:29,407
If that girI is meant for you...

1024
01:31:29,582 --> 01:31:33,348
...then nothing on earth
can keep her from you...

1025
01:31:33,953 --> 01:31:36,183
...and if she isn't meant for you...

1026
01:31:36,689 --> 01:31:39,556
...then nothing on earth
can bring her to you.

1027
01:31:39,725 --> 01:31:44,992
The decision isn't in your hands,
it's in God's.

1028
01:31:45,831 --> 01:31:47,423
Now we have to see...

1029
01:31:47,600 --> 01:31:50,398
...how God decides
to place his cross.

1030
01:31:50,569 --> 01:31:53,800
This way or that way.

1031
01:31:55,274 --> 01:32:00,644
Listen, I am tired of telling you
there's no Imaan here.

1032
01:32:00,813 --> 01:32:04,249
Brother, I've traveled for three hours.
Please, just check once more.

1033
01:32:04,416 --> 01:32:05,906
It is a matter of life and death.

1034
01:32:06,085 --> 01:32:08,485
Hey, Aslam, go and check
number 110. Yes, tell me.

1035
01:32:08,654 --> 01:32:13,557
- Last year too.
- Last year, many men came and left.

1036
01:32:13,726 --> 01:32:15,887
Okay, if Imaan does show up,
let him know...

1037
01:32:16,061 --> 01:32:17,926
...that Sakina is waiting
for him by the bridge.

1038
01:32:18,097 --> 01:32:22,227
It has been raining heavy for
three days, no one can come or go.

1039
01:32:22,401 --> 01:32:24,301
You'd better leave at once too.

1040
01:32:25,104 --> 01:32:27,095
That means no Imaan will come...

1041
01:32:27,272 --> 01:32:30,139
- ... and he probably doesn't even exist.
- Won't come.

1042
01:32:30,676 --> 01:32:32,371
That means I did nothing wrong
by burning that letter.

1043
01:32:32,544 --> 01:32:33,909
Did nothing wrong.

1044
01:32:34,079 --> 01:32:36,240
- That means God is with me.
- Yes, with you.

1045
01:32:36,415 --> 01:32:39,782
- That means Sakina is mine!
- Yes, yes, Sakina is yours! Take her!

1046
01:32:39,952 --> 01:32:42,750
- Hey! Let go of me!
- Yes!

1047
01:32:48,727 --> 01:32:50,490
Yes, my Lilipop!
Understand what I'm saying.

1048
01:32:50,663 --> 01:32:52,324
The rain has closed all the roads
up the mountain.

1049
01:32:52,498 --> 01:32:54,056
Now no one can come.

1050
01:32:54,233 --> 01:32:58,636
For the last three days,
no one has left or come to this lodge.

1051
01:32:58,804 --> 01:33:00,738
Even if I had taken the letter,
who would've read it?

1052
01:33:00,906 --> 01:33:02,874
Listen to me, Sakina has fooled me!

1053
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:06,478
There is no Imaan, he doesn't exist!

1054
01:33:07,913 --> 01:33:09,244
No, I was talking to myself.

1055
01:33:09,415 --> 01:33:11,679
I'll come home and explain
everything to you!

1056
01:33:12,251 --> 01:33:14,344
I love her too much, Lilipop.

1057
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:16,715
I can't do without her.

1058
01:33:17,356 --> 01:33:19,654
I love her!

1059
01:33:23,028 --> 01:33:25,019
Look, Jhumri, a new carpet.

1060
01:33:25,197 --> 01:33:29,133
You kept asking
who's this huge carpet for?

1061
01:33:29,301 --> 01:33:31,565
It's for our Nawab Saheb.

1062
01:33:31,737 --> 01:33:34,297
He will enter our home
with this beneath his feet.

1063
01:33:34,473 --> 01:33:37,670
- What do you think of it?
- It's okay.

1064
01:33:37,843 --> 01:33:41,335
Are you still angry
because of last night?

1065
01:33:41,513 --> 01:33:44,914
- Come on, please forgive me.
- All right, you're forgiven.

1066
01:33:45,184 --> 01:33:48,176
Jhumri, we'll celebrate Eid
lavishly today.

1067
01:33:48,353 --> 01:33:50,844
Look how well
I've decorated the house.

1068
01:33:51,023 --> 01:33:52,581
So have you gotten your reply?

1069
01:33:57,830 --> 01:34:00,628
I'm asking you,
did you get your reply?

1070
01:34:01,600 --> 01:34:02,624
No...

1071
01:34:03,302 --> 01:34:08,501
...but the Eid moon will rise today,
he will come, and so will my answer.

1072
01:34:08,674 --> 01:34:12,633
He'll ask Grandma for my hand,
and we'll be married...

1073
01:34:12,811 --> 01:34:18,147
...and if he wants, he can be
Grandma's son and I his bride.

1074
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,787
Why are you crying?

1075
01:34:23,222 --> 01:34:25,213
I'm not leaving so soon.

1076
01:34:26,091 --> 01:34:28,787
I'm crying at your obsession...

1077
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:31,020
...and at my deceit.

1078
01:34:31,196 --> 01:34:35,656
Just for your sake
I lied that I saw Imaan.

1079
01:34:38,570 --> 01:34:41,505
So that you'd be happy during Eid.

1080
01:34:42,007 --> 01:34:44,669
But your madness...

1081
01:34:48,180 --> 01:34:52,082
Maybe you're destined to wait
eternally, just the way your mother did.

1082
01:34:52,251 --> 01:34:54,742
Mark my words. He won't come!

1083
01:35:03,262 --> 01:35:07,062
Jhumri, you don't even
know how to lie.

1084
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:13,732
He will come, just you wait
till the moon rises.

1085
01:35:16,241 --> 01:35:18,038
I know he will come.

1086
01:35:20,612 --> 01:35:23,547
Moon, why do you
show off so much?

1087
01:35:23,715 --> 01:35:27,446
Will you just appear? The boy
has to go and propose to his love.

1088
01:35:27,619 --> 01:35:30,417
If you take so long, how will he go?

1089
01:35:32,791 --> 01:35:34,816
You're talking to the moon?

1090
01:35:35,160 --> 01:35:36,286
Has it appeared?

1091
01:35:36,461 --> 01:35:41,091
That moon hasn't appeared,
but mine has.

1092
01:35:41,300 --> 01:35:44,758
Let's see how you look.

1093
01:35:48,140 --> 01:35:49,402
Very handsome.

1094
01:35:49,975 --> 01:35:53,638
Thanks. After all,
I'm going to wish Sakina on Eid.

1095
01:35:54,146 --> 01:35:58,378
Are you just going to wish her or are
you going to tell her how you feeI?

1096
01:35:58,550 --> 01:36:01,280
That's the problem, Lilipop.
See how nervous I am.

1097
01:36:01,453 --> 01:36:04,820
Why are you so nervous?
Be a man.

1098
01:36:05,490 --> 01:36:08,323
This is the most important day
of your life.

1099
01:36:08,493 --> 01:36:11,360
You're going to propose to Sakina...

1100
01:36:11,530 --> 01:36:15,933
...so make it memorable.

1101
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:19,731
Superb idea, but how?

1102
01:36:19,905 --> 01:36:25,434
Walk in like a king
and call out to her.

1103
01:36:25,611 --> 01:36:31,709
Look at her and smile.
If she comes near, move away.

1104
01:36:31,884 --> 01:36:33,511
And what if she moves away?

1105
01:36:34,820 --> 01:36:37,084
If she moves away, call out to her.

1106
01:36:37,256 --> 01:36:39,588
"Oh, my love. "

1107
01:36:39,758 --> 01:36:43,956
If she turns to look at you, beckon her.
If she comes close, take her hand.

1108
01:36:44,496 --> 01:36:46,828
If she resists, hold her tight.

1109
01:36:47,266 --> 01:36:52,465
Put your face close to her
and share your feelings with her.

1110
01:36:52,638 --> 01:36:54,765
"I love you, baby!"

1111
01:36:54,940 --> 01:37:00,207
And then, if you kiss her lips,
she will be yours forever.

1112
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:04,105
Forget Sakina.

1113
01:37:04,283 --> 01:37:07,081
Lilipop, will you marry me?

1114
01:37:07,252 --> 01:37:09,846
You rascaI, get out of here!

1115
01:37:10,022 --> 01:37:13,116
Hurry before someone else
steals her away!

1116
01:37:13,792 --> 01:37:16,852
Impossible!
Sweetie, today Raj is a rock star.

1117
01:37:19,398 --> 01:37:21,298
You just see, baby.

1118
01:37:21,800 --> 01:37:24,200
Whether the moon shines or not...

1119
01:37:25,003 --> 01:37:27,369
...tonight it will definitely shine
in this house.

1120
01:37:29,241 --> 01:37:32,677
Before bringing Sakina home,
I'll call you.

1121
01:37:33,845 --> 01:37:35,574
Wait for my call.

1122
01:37:41,520 --> 01:37:42,817
Okay, bye!

1123
01:37:42,988 --> 01:37:45,218
Okay, bye!

1124
01:38:15,253 --> 01:38:24,423
The moonlight was never
This gorgeous before

1125
01:38:25,430 --> 01:38:30,367
The moon was confused

1126
01:38:30,535 --> 01:38:35,097
Saw you and was embarrassed

1127
01:38:35,273 --> 01:38:41,769
Now he's just shying away

1128
01:38:42,214 --> 01:38:49,746
The moonlight was never
This gorgeous before

1129
01:38:50,722 --> 01:39:00,654
The moonlight was never
This gorgeous before

1130
01:39:00,832 --> 01:39:05,735
The moon was confused

1131
01:39:05,904 --> 01:39:10,773
Saw you and was embarrassed

1132
01:39:10,942 --> 01:39:15,936
Now he's just shying away

1133
01:39:16,114 --> 01:39:20,448
This gorgeous

1134
01:39:49,181 --> 01:39:54,016
Behold, the moon is here
The moon is finally here

1135
01:39:56,721 --> 01:40:01,522
Behold, the moon is here
The moon is finally here

1136
01:40:01,693 --> 01:40:06,221
Behold, the moon is here
The moon is finally here

1137
01:40:06,398 --> 01:40:10,858
It's here, it's here, it's here
The moon is here, shying away

1138
01:40:11,036 --> 01:40:16,372
It's here, it's here, it's here
The moon is here, shying away

1139
01:40:16,875 --> 01:40:21,209
Do come now, you too

1140
01:40:21,780 --> 01:40:26,410
My love

1141
01:40:26,585 --> 01:40:30,817
It's here, it's here, it's here
The moon is here

1142
01:40:30,989 --> 01:40:36,086
The moon is here, it's here
It's here, it's here, the moon is here

1143
01:40:36,261 --> 01:40:41,062
Shying away, it's here
It's here, the moon is here

1144
01:40:46,571 --> 01:40:51,873
Slowly, slowly the breeze flows
Whispers quietly

1145
01:40:52,043 --> 01:40:56,412
Everything about you

1146
01:40:56,581 --> 01:41:01,883
How sweet is this pain
Searing through my senses

1147
01:41:02,053 --> 01:41:06,888
Every moment is intoxicated

1148
01:41:07,058 --> 01:41:11,859
In a stupor I fall
Here and there

1149
01:41:12,030 --> 01:41:16,933
Silent glances drive me nuts

1150
01:41:17,102 --> 01:41:23,598
I'm so insanely in love with you

1151
01:41:23,775 --> 01:41:26,369
This gorgeous

1152
01:42:31,509 --> 01:42:34,034
You trouble me a lot.

1153
01:42:36,781 --> 01:42:38,373
Someone's looking very
handsome tonight.

1154
01:42:38,984 --> 01:42:41,509
You finally agreed.

1155
01:42:42,487 --> 01:42:44,250
What was the answer?

1156
01:42:44,656 --> 01:42:46,146
It's a yes for me.

1157
01:42:46,324 --> 01:42:47,518
Did you meet him?

1158
01:42:47,692 --> 01:42:49,557
Sakina, will you marry me?

1159
01:42:49,728 --> 01:42:51,662
How is he doing?
Is he all right? What did he say?

1160
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:53,388
- Sakina, I was-
- Tell me straight up...

1161
01:42:53,565 --> 01:42:56,193
- ... did you meet him or not?
- You're not talking straight either.

1162
01:42:56,368 --> 01:43:01,067
Raj, my life depends on this.

1163
01:43:01,239 --> 01:43:02,399
Mine too.

1164
01:43:02,574 --> 01:43:05,304
I can't live a moment without him.

1165
01:43:05,477 --> 01:43:07,911
And I can't forget you
for a moment.

1166
01:43:09,381 --> 01:43:12,111
Sakina, if you're happy
then I'm happy...

1167
01:43:12,284 --> 01:43:14,752
...and your sorrow is mine.

1168
01:43:14,919 --> 01:43:16,887
I love you, baby!

1169
01:43:17,422 --> 01:43:18,650
Will you marry me?

1170
01:43:18,823 --> 01:43:20,347
Jokes.

1171
01:43:20,525 --> 01:43:23,187
Your silly jokes.
Can't you take anything seriously?

1172
01:43:24,796 --> 01:43:28,562
Where were you yesterday?
I waited the whole night for you.

1173
01:43:29,167 --> 01:43:32,898
For me? Don't you usually
wait for Imaan here?

1174
01:43:33,071 --> 01:43:36,336
But last night I waited just for you.

1175
01:43:37,042 --> 01:43:40,842
Okay, I'll believe you.

1176
01:43:43,348 --> 01:43:45,043
It's time.

1177
01:43:45,884 --> 01:43:48,284
- I have to go meet someone.
- Whom?

1178
01:43:48,453 --> 01:43:50,318
Someone speciaI.

1179
01:43:50,488 --> 01:43:51,955
Who's this girI?

1180
01:43:52,123 --> 01:43:53,454
What is it to you?

1181
01:43:53,625 --> 01:43:55,616
All right, go if you have to...

1182
01:43:55,794 --> 01:43:59,491
...but there must be a way
to know his answer.

1183
01:43:59,664 --> 01:44:01,723
Hope he didn't take offense
to the letter.

1184
01:44:01,900 --> 01:44:03,128
Raj, if it was you-

1185
01:44:03,301 --> 01:44:06,429
Please, now don't say
if I were in his place.

1186
01:44:06,604 --> 01:44:09,402
I sent the letter like you asked me
and that's it.

1187
01:44:09,574 --> 01:44:12,407
Believe me,
the letter's quite useless...

1188
01:44:13,178 --> 01:44:15,544
...since Imaan doesn't even exist!

1189
01:44:15,714 --> 01:44:19,411
If you say that again,
I won't ever speak to you!

1190
01:44:19,584 --> 01:44:22,951
Okay, Sakina, I have a way
to find out his reply.

1191
01:44:24,122 --> 01:44:25,282
What?

1192
01:44:26,358 --> 01:44:28,349
Sakina, we'll pick notes
to figure out his answer.

1193
01:44:28,526 --> 01:44:31,256
Oh, my God!
You did give him my note, right?

1194
01:44:31,429 --> 01:44:33,897
Oh, not the letter, stupid!

1195
01:44:34,065 --> 01:44:37,125
I mean the notes
that say yes and no.

1196
01:44:37,302 --> 01:44:39,133
Okay, fine, go ahead and write.

1197
01:44:39,304 --> 01:44:44,606
So on the first one we will write,
"He will not come. "

1198
01:44:45,076 --> 01:44:46,805
You started that again.

1199
01:44:46,978 --> 01:44:49,742
Come on, look there. No cheating.

1200
01:44:50,148 --> 01:44:54,414
And on the other one we'll write,
"He will come. "

1201
01:44:57,422 --> 01:44:58,912
Are you done writing?

1202
01:45:00,024 --> 01:45:01,719
No cheating.

1203
01:45:03,695 --> 01:45:05,629
Here, choose your destiny.

1204
01:46:17,202 --> 01:46:20,069
Didn't you have to go somewhere?

1205
01:46:20,438 --> 01:46:23,464
- Where?
- To meet someone speciaI.

1206
01:46:23,708 --> 01:46:26,006
Oh, yes. I completely forgot.

1207
01:46:26,177 --> 01:46:27,906
You should leave soon.

1208
01:46:29,113 --> 01:46:30,944
Without you?

1209
01:46:31,616 --> 01:46:33,277
You can't do without me?

1210
01:46:34,085 --> 01:46:36,610
What can I do?
You've become a habit now.

1211
01:46:37,288 --> 01:46:39,518
And tomorrow,
when I'm not around?

1212
01:46:39,791 --> 01:46:41,486
Then...

1213
01:46:55,473 --> 01:46:56,940
Then...

1214
01:47:33,077 --> 01:47:34,510
It's a strange evening.

1215
01:47:34,679 --> 01:47:37,477
We haven't spoken a word
in the past hour.

1216
01:47:37,649 --> 01:47:39,173
We haven't eaten
or drunk anything.

1217
01:47:39,350 --> 01:47:42,513
Just been sitting around like this.
Sad, isn't it?

1218
01:47:44,188 --> 01:47:45,985
- Shall we leave now?
- Why? We've just-

1219
01:47:46,157 --> 01:47:49,320
No, Raj, you called upon our
friendship, that's why I came.

1220
01:47:49,494 --> 01:47:51,928
Anyway, I feeI a bit
out of place here.

1221
01:47:52,096 --> 01:47:54,860
- What if he is already at the bridge?
- So what?

1222
01:47:55,033 --> 01:47:57,501
Sakina, you've waited
a whole year for him.

1223
01:47:57,669 --> 01:48:00,968
And even if Imaan turns up early,
can't he wait five minutes for you?

1224
01:48:01,139 --> 01:48:05,633
Let's forget all this for a few moments.
Today is Eid, a day to celebrate.

1225
01:48:07,011 --> 01:48:08,638
Isn't this a good idea?

1226
01:48:09,347 --> 01:48:11,372
A better idea would be
to leave here.

1227
01:48:11,549 --> 01:48:13,244
I've had enough.

1228
01:48:49,220 --> 01:48:51,916
Friends, friends, friends!

1229
01:48:53,057 --> 01:48:55,252
Have any of you
ever loved anyone?

1230
01:48:55,426 --> 01:48:57,917
- Yes!
- I have too.

1231
01:48:58,096 --> 01:49:01,190
That's great, but what about her?

1232
01:49:01,366 --> 01:49:02,697
That's just it.

1233
01:49:02,867 --> 01:49:05,495
I doubt she ever will.

1234
01:49:06,437 --> 01:49:09,167
No, but does that stop me
from loving her?

1235
01:49:10,174 --> 01:49:13,302
Friends? Does that stop me
from loving her?

1236
01:49:13,478 --> 01:49:15,639
No!

1237
01:49:15,813 --> 01:49:19,613
So then, my favorite song
for that speciaI girI.

1238
01:49:20,151 --> 01:49:25,088
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

1239
01:49:25,256 --> 01:49:29,556
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

1240
01:49:29,727 --> 01:49:34,994
Set you in a palanquin

1241
01:49:35,333 --> 01:49:40,361
Decorate it with stars

1242
01:49:40,538 --> 01:49:44,406
Steal you away from this world

1243
01:49:47,912 --> 01:49:50,244
Steal you from this world

1244
01:49:50,415 --> 01:49:59,380
Steal away your heart

1245
01:49:59,557 --> 01:50:06,156
Oh, my love

1246
01:50:36,227 --> 01:50:40,789
Under the tent of your lashes

1247
01:50:40,965 --> 01:50:45,561
Inside the cave of your dreams

1248
01:50:45,770 --> 01:50:50,298
Are embedded your shadows

1249
01:50:50,475 --> 01:50:54,707
You there in all my yearnings

1250
01:50:54,879 --> 01:50:59,213
I fell hard for your silent, sweet gaze

1251
01:50:59,383 --> 01:51:04,013
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

1252
01:51:04,188 --> 01:51:08,488
Oh, my love
Oh, my love

1253
01:51:08,659 --> 01:51:13,961
Set you in a palanquin
Decorate it with stars

1254
01:51:14,132 --> 01:51:18,466
Steal you away from this world

1255
01:51:19,337 --> 01:51:23,933
I wanna be your date tonight
You're gonna be my princess in white

1256
01:51:24,108 --> 01:51:28,738
I'll never let you out of my sight
Please be my date tonight

1257
01:51:28,913 --> 01:51:33,441
I wanna be your date tonight
You're gonna be my princess in white

1258
01:51:33,618 --> 01:51:38,681
I'll never let you out of my sight
Please be my date tonight

1259
01:51:48,132 --> 01:51:50,327
Lilipop? Hi. Guess what.

1260
01:51:50,501 --> 01:51:51,900
Sakina is with me.

1261
01:51:52,069 --> 01:51:54,037
Yes! And I'm bringing her home.

1262
01:51:54,205 --> 01:51:56,605
Okay, okay. Now listen carefully...

1263
01:51:56,974 --> 01:52:00,375
...when I bring her home, sing those
old classic songs on the piano.

1264
01:52:00,545 --> 01:52:03,673
Have you rehearsed it? Fantastic.
We'll start the evening with that.

1265
01:52:03,848 --> 01:52:06,976
Listen, ask Maria to take out
all your old photo albums.

1266
01:52:07,151 --> 01:52:09,119
Sakina will look at your
photographs all night...

1267
01:52:09,287 --> 01:52:11,755
...and I will look at her.
Good idea, isn't it?

1268
01:52:11,923 --> 01:52:13,652
And is your plum cake ready?

1269
01:52:13,825 --> 01:52:16,419
Good, good, good.
But don't force her to cut it.

1270
01:52:16,594 --> 01:52:19,495
Please don't put up any balloons.
It's no one's birthday.

1271
01:52:19,664 --> 01:52:21,256
And the most important thing...

1272
01:52:21,432 --> 01:52:25,232
...when we get there,
please don't cry.

1273
01:52:25,870 --> 01:52:27,599
Yes. Don't start crying.

1274
01:52:28,139 --> 01:52:32,235
Okay, okay. Now don't forget to wear
that black frilly frock of yours.

1275
01:52:32,410 --> 01:52:33,707
Sakina and I are coming home.

1276
01:52:33,878 --> 01:52:37,575
And remember, you will always
be my first love, Lilipop!

1277
01:52:41,419 --> 01:52:44,013
Oh, God. She's so happy,
if only you could see her.

1278
01:52:44,188 --> 01:52:47,453
Tell her it's because it was
my first time dancing at a party.

1279
01:52:47,625 --> 01:52:51,584
She danced to my song, and how!

1280
01:52:51,762 --> 01:52:53,457
If only you could see her.

1281
01:52:53,631 --> 01:52:54,962
Tell her that I wish her
a very happy Eid.

1282
01:52:55,132 --> 01:52:56,429
She's wishing you a happy Eid.

1283
01:52:56,601 --> 01:52:58,865
- Same to you.
- Same to you.

1284
01:53:00,404 --> 01:53:03,100
- And where's my present?
- She's also asking for her gift.

1285
01:53:03,274 --> 01:53:05,572
Okay. Hang on,
you'd better ask her yourself.

1286
01:53:05,743 --> 01:53:08,712
- What will I say?
- She's a very nice lady.

1287
01:53:13,217 --> 01:53:15,014
Sakina.

1288
01:53:20,024 --> 01:53:21,582
Sakina?

1289
01:53:21,759 --> 01:53:23,727
- I have to go.
- Where?

1290
01:53:23,895 --> 01:53:26,159
- To the bridge.
- What?

1291
01:53:26,330 --> 01:53:27,820
He'll be waiting for me.

1292
01:53:27,999 --> 01:53:29,728
Who will be waiting?

1293
01:53:29,901 --> 01:53:31,994
- Raj, let me go.
- Sakina, just talk once to Lilipop.

1294
01:53:32,169 --> 01:53:34,296
For God's sake,
please let me go, Raj.

1295
01:53:35,206 --> 01:53:38,607
- Hear me out. Sakina!
- I don't want to hear anything!

1296
01:53:38,776 --> 01:53:41,142
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1297
01:53:42,079 --> 01:53:44,513
For God's sake,
please let me go, Raj.

1298
01:53:46,550 --> 01:53:48,518
Come on, Sakina,
just talk to her, please.

1299
01:53:50,488 --> 01:53:52,046
Please.

1300
01:53:58,029 --> 01:53:59,997
Sakina! Wait!

1301
01:54:00,698 --> 01:54:02,893
Lilipop, Sakina's feeling shy.

1302
01:54:03,067 --> 01:54:06,093
Oh, look at her. Stop! Stop it!

1303
01:54:06,270 --> 01:54:09,103
No, no, no, we're not fighting,
she's tickling me.

1304
01:54:09,740 --> 01:54:12,470
Yeah, okay. We're just coming home.
We'll be home soon.

1305
01:54:12,643 --> 01:54:14,838
Okay, bye. Okay.

1306
01:54:17,448 --> 01:54:19,313
Sakina!

1307
01:54:23,020 --> 01:54:24,851
Sakina!

1308
01:54:35,266 --> 01:54:36,995
Sakina!

1309
01:54:55,720 --> 01:54:57,779
- Leave me alone!
- At least listen to what I'm trying to say.

1310
01:54:57,955 --> 01:55:00,617
- I don't want to hear a word!
- No, Sakina. You have to listen to me!

1311
01:55:00,791 --> 01:55:02,554
Sakina, I cannot live without you.

1312
01:55:02,727 --> 01:55:05,355
Forget him, please.
I'll keep you happy.

1313
01:55:05,529 --> 01:55:07,690
We'll create a world of our own.

1314
01:55:07,865 --> 01:55:10,390
My world is Imaan, that's it!

1315
01:55:10,568 --> 01:55:13,128
Then what were these four nights
you spent with me?

1316
01:55:13,304 --> 01:55:14,999
That was just friendship, Raj!

1317
01:55:15,172 --> 01:55:16,571
Simple friendship.

1318
01:55:16,741 --> 01:55:19,301
And if I were unfaithfuI to him
for even a moment...

1319
01:55:19,477 --> 01:55:23,311
...then may God never, ever
forgive me. Never, ever...

1320
01:55:24,115 --> 01:55:25,605
...never forgive me.

1321
01:55:26,150 --> 01:55:29,677
In any case, God will not forgive you,
because you have hurt me, Sakina.

1322
01:55:29,854 --> 01:55:30,946
And you know...

1323
01:55:31,122 --> 01:55:32,851
...you know how much I love you.

1324
01:55:33,024 --> 01:55:35,549
And I hate you!

1325
01:55:37,094 --> 01:55:38,561
He was right.

1326
01:55:38,729 --> 01:55:40,321
That man was right for you...

1327
01:55:40,498 --> 01:55:44,958
...left a token in your hand,
and disappeared, never to look back.

1328
01:55:46,871 --> 01:55:49,032
He was so right!

1329
01:55:54,245 --> 01:55:55,974
He was so right.

1330
01:56:05,756 --> 01:56:07,155
Saawariya?

1331
01:56:09,193 --> 01:56:10,353
What's the matter?

1332
01:56:10,528 --> 01:56:13,326
I was hoping to catch sight
of the moon through the window...

1333
01:56:13,497 --> 01:56:15,522
...but you just walked right in
through the door.

1334
01:56:15,699 --> 01:56:17,496
Can I sit here for a while?

1335
01:56:19,003 --> 01:56:21,471
You are the first man who has
come here just to sit.

1336
01:56:21,639 --> 01:56:24,039
The others always...

1337
01:56:25,342 --> 01:56:29,369
- Were you going somewhere?
- Yes, we're celebrating Eid at Razia's.

1338
01:56:29,547 --> 01:56:31,538
But you can come in.

1339
01:56:31,715 --> 01:56:35,515
There must be celebrations
at your girlfriend's too, right?

1340
01:56:35,686 --> 01:56:38,018
Did you meet her last night or not?

1341
01:56:38,722 --> 01:56:41,953
I'd figured that you and her would
have been sitting on the bridge...

1342
01:56:42,126 --> 01:56:44,594
...whispering sweet nothings
into each other's ears.

1343
01:56:45,329 --> 01:56:47,797
That bridge is broken, Gulabji.

1344
01:56:48,432 --> 01:56:52,232
What I mistook for reality
turned out to be an illusion.

1345
01:56:52,603 --> 01:56:53,695
How comes?

1346
01:56:53,871 --> 01:56:57,136
If she believes she has Imaan
and I have no one...

1347
01:56:57,308 --> 01:56:59,208
...she is wrong.

1348
01:57:01,212 --> 01:57:03,180
I can also love someone else
besides her.

1349
01:57:03,981 --> 01:57:06,575
Can you really?

1350
01:57:08,319 --> 01:57:11,618
- Sure, I can. With you.
- Me?

1351
01:57:17,161 --> 01:57:18,788
Oh, my Saawariya...

1352
01:57:18,963 --> 01:57:22,160
...do paper flowers
ever carry fragrance?

1353
01:57:22,766 --> 01:57:26,065
Right now, you're not thinking straight.
We'll talk tomorrow.

1354
01:57:26,237 --> 01:57:27,966
Get going.

1355
01:57:28,873 --> 01:57:30,340
I won't go.

1356
01:57:30,508 --> 01:57:31,702
But I need to go.

1357
01:57:31,876 --> 01:57:35,073
As the night moves on,
customers will start lining up soon.

1358
01:57:35,246 --> 01:57:36,372
Where will you sit then?

1359
01:57:36,547 --> 01:57:39,482
Then think of me as one
of your customers tonight.

1360
01:57:41,352 --> 01:57:43,377
I'll pay for every second
of your time.

1361
01:57:46,557 --> 01:57:48,320
Naseeban!

1362
01:57:51,295 --> 01:57:53,286
Naseeban!

1363
01:57:54,198 --> 01:57:55,358
Get out!

1364
01:57:55,533 --> 01:57:58,661
Get lost from here!
Didn't you hear what Gulab said?

1365
01:57:58,836 --> 01:58:00,326
We've seen a lot like you.

1366
01:58:00,504 --> 01:58:02,938
If you show up again,
I'll break your legs. Go!

1367
01:58:03,107 --> 01:58:05,667
Don't you dare even say
Gulab's name again!

1368
01:58:05,843 --> 01:58:07,208
Gulabji!

1369
01:58:07,378 --> 01:58:10,279
- You're done for!
- Gulabji!

1370
01:58:11,215 --> 01:58:13,115
Gulabji!

1371
01:58:19,456 --> 01:58:20,923
What?

1372
01:58:24,495 --> 01:58:26,759
Hey, stop messing around
and leave now.

1373
01:58:26,931 --> 01:58:28,262
Gulabji!

1374
01:58:59,730 --> 01:59:01,027
What's wrong with you?

1375
01:59:01,198 --> 01:59:02,563
You love him so much...

1376
01:59:02,733 --> 01:59:05,497
...and yet you threw him out of here.

1377
01:59:05,669 --> 01:59:08,968
- He's getting beaten up downstairs.
- Then let him.

1378
01:59:09,139 --> 01:59:12,108
If I didn't kick him out,
he'd be spending the rest of his life...

1379
01:59:12,276 --> 01:59:13,709
...getting kicked around
these filthy streets.

1380
01:59:14,111 --> 01:59:16,671
- But, Gulab, don't you feeI that-?
- That's enough!

1381
01:59:16,847 --> 01:59:19,111
One more word out of you
and you've had it!

1382
01:59:19,283 --> 01:59:20,841
Get out!

1383
02:00:04,028 --> 02:00:05,962
Forgive me, Raj.

1384
02:00:06,130 --> 02:00:08,360
I have really hurt you.

1385
02:00:11,502 --> 02:00:13,800
You were right...

1386
02:00:13,971 --> 02:00:18,032
...he's not come
and I doubt if he ever will.

1387
02:00:18,609 --> 02:00:20,042
I don't know about all that.

1388
02:00:20,210 --> 02:00:23,907
AII I want to say is that...

1389
02:00:24,081 --> 02:00:27,448
...I burnt the letter you gave me.

1390
02:00:28,419 --> 02:00:30,717
And you know why.

1391
02:00:30,888 --> 02:00:32,947
And you probably won't
believe this either...

1392
02:00:33,123 --> 02:00:35,250
...but I did go look for him today.

1393
02:00:36,026 --> 02:00:38,051
There was no Imaan there.

1394
02:00:38,295 --> 02:00:40,957
But if you still insist,
I guess I can try again.

1395
02:00:41,131 --> 02:00:42,928
No, Raj.

1396
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:44,965
There's no need.

1397
02:00:45,135 --> 02:00:47,626
Burning that letter was probably
the best thing to do.

1398
02:00:47,805 --> 02:00:50,171
How much more ridicule can I bear?

1399
02:00:50,708 --> 02:00:52,869
I really want to forget him.

1400
02:00:53,410 --> 02:00:58,279
It's difficult, but I will try my best.

1401
02:00:59,249 --> 02:01:01,740
You're with me, right?

1402
02:01:02,353 --> 02:01:04,685
Is this something you really
need to ask, Sakina?

1403
02:01:05,556 --> 02:01:08,616
You've given him
a whole year of your life...

1404
02:01:08,792 --> 02:01:11,784
...but I'm willing to give
a whole lifetime to forget him.

1405
02:01:11,962 --> 02:01:13,623
An entire lifetime!

1406
02:01:14,598 --> 02:01:16,088
What happened?

1407
02:01:17,601 --> 02:01:19,125
Did you see that?

1408
02:01:19,336 --> 02:01:22,066
For a moment, you forgot him,
didn't you?

1409
02:01:24,141 --> 02:01:25,836
Trust me, Sakina.

1410
02:01:26,009 --> 02:01:28,569
I'll make you happy
and you will forget him.

1411
02:01:30,314 --> 02:01:33,044
Can I ask you something?

1412
02:01:33,751 --> 02:01:37,209
Is there even a little place
in your heart for me?

1413
02:01:43,694 --> 02:01:47,824
No problem. I guess
it will take some time.

1414
02:01:48,165 --> 02:01:49,792
No problem.

1415
02:01:52,236 --> 02:01:54,898
Look at you. You're sad again.

1416
02:01:55,639 --> 02:01:57,504
In the next three seconds...

1417
02:01:57,674 --> 02:02:00,973
...if I don't make you smile,
you won't see me ever.

1418
02:02:01,545 --> 02:02:03,103
One.

1419
02:02:04,314 --> 02:02:05,804
Two.

1420
02:02:08,419 --> 02:02:09,977
Three.

1421
02:02:12,389 --> 02:02:13,856
Three.

1422
02:02:16,560 --> 02:02:18,187
Three.

1423
02:02:19,463 --> 02:02:20,930
Three.

1424
02:02:25,369 --> 02:02:26,836
Three.

1425
02:02:43,687 --> 02:02:47,521
- My umbrella?
- Yes, you had forgotten it yesterday.

1426
02:02:47,691 --> 02:02:51,650
- That means you were here last night.
- Yes. No. Actually-

1427
02:02:51,829 --> 02:02:53,296
Raj, I'm going to hit you!

1428
02:02:53,464 --> 02:02:56,456
No, no, wait, hold this umbrella.
Here, try now.

1429
02:03:03,006 --> 02:03:04,337
I think you've gone mad.

1430
02:03:04,508 --> 02:03:06,772
Don't stop me, Sakina.
I'm a different man today.

1431
02:03:06,944 --> 02:03:09,936
I'm so happy that I don't
know what to do!

1432
02:03:10,113 --> 02:03:11,740
Everyone's asleep. Be quiet!

1433
02:03:11,915 --> 02:03:14,076
Just wait and see tomorrow,
when people wake up, they'll say:

1434
02:03:14,251 --> 02:03:17,618
"It's a beautifuI day!"
You will say that also, won't you?

1435
02:04:23,587 --> 02:04:28,217
My sweetest
You are the only one in this heart

1436
02:04:28,392 --> 02:04:33,091
Just you and only you

1437
02:04:33,263 --> 02:04:37,700
You are the only one in this heart

1438
02:04:37,868 --> 02:04:42,532
You are mine

1439
02:04:42,706 --> 02:04:47,666
Only mine

1440
02:04:47,844 --> 02:04:52,645
Only mine

1441
02:04:52,816 --> 02:04:58,812
Don't torture me
Don't leave me, please

1442
02:05:00,290 --> 02:05:04,920
I implore you, my sweetest

1443
02:05:05,095 --> 02:05:12,331
You are the only one in this heart

1444
02:05:12,502 --> 02:05:17,496
You are the only one in this heart

1445
02:05:50,841 --> 02:05:52,604
Sakina.

1446
02:05:53,310 --> 02:05:54,868
Sakina.

1447
02:06:02,452 --> 02:06:04,647
I'll never forget this night.

1448
02:06:04,821 --> 02:06:06,618
Lilipop will also be so happy.

1449
02:06:06,790 --> 02:06:08,087
I'm too excited!

1450
02:06:11,862 --> 02:06:13,523
Oh, sorry.

1451
02:06:14,431 --> 02:06:17,229
Tomorrow she will announce
to everybody:

1452
02:06:17,534 --> 02:06:20,560
"Sakina is the most beautifuI bride
for my Raj. "

1453
02:06:21,071 --> 02:06:24,939
Let's go, she's probably
waiting for us.

1454
02:07:19,963 --> 02:07:22,488
Hey, Sakina, what's wrong?

1455
02:07:22,833 --> 02:07:24,460
Hello?

1456
02:07:32,042 --> 02:07:33,373
He's come, Raj!

1457
02:07:33,543 --> 02:07:35,272
He's come!

1458
02:07:37,748 --> 02:07:39,409
I have to go...

1459
02:07:39,583 --> 02:07:41,574
...I really have to go.

1460
02:07:42,085 --> 02:07:43,916
I should go.

1461
02:07:44,621 --> 02:07:46,589
You understand me, right?

1462
02:07:47,157 --> 02:07:49,216
You do understand me, Raj?

1463
02:07:50,227 --> 02:07:52,127
I need you to understand.

1464
02:07:57,334 --> 02:07:59,495
I know this is hurting you...

1465
02:07:59,669 --> 02:08:01,796
...but please forgive me.

1466
02:08:03,874 --> 02:08:05,466
Please forgive me.

1467
02:08:05,642 --> 02:08:07,667
Please forgive me.

1468
02:08:08,378 --> 02:08:10,812
For a moment I did think
we could be together-

1469
02:08:10,981 --> 02:08:14,007
No, Sakina, even if you loved me
for a few moments...

1470
02:08:14,184 --> 02:08:16,550
...it's enough to give me joy
for a lifetime.

1471
02:08:17,454 --> 02:08:18,716
I swear.

1472
02:08:21,291 --> 02:08:22,986
I swear.

1473
02:08:33,470 --> 02:08:36,030
Go, Sakina. Go now.

1474
02:08:39,209 --> 02:08:44,943
Go, Sakina, be happy and leave...

1475
02:08:45,115 --> 02:08:46,548
...and don't worry.

1476
02:08:46,716 --> 02:08:49,014
I'll explain to Lilipop.

1477
02:08:50,554 --> 02:08:52,021
Just go.

1478
02:10:26,182 --> 02:10:28,275
Praise God.

1479
02:10:29,119 --> 02:10:32,850
Seems God has taken his time making
you, and he doesn't want to stop.

1480
02:10:36,526 --> 02:10:41,156
When I left,
you had tears in your eyes.

1481
02:10:41,331 --> 02:10:45,734
Now I'm back
and you're still crying?

1482
02:10:46,970 --> 02:10:48,631
Sakina...

1483
02:10:54,311 --> 02:10:57,974
...will you agree to live a life
full of hardships with me?

1484
02:11:00,450 --> 02:11:02,042
I do.

1485
02:11:05,555 --> 02:11:07,318
I do.

1486
02:11:12,896 --> 02:11:14,523
I do.

1487
02:12:11,721 --> 02:12:17,785
They say if you find true love,
God has been generous to you.

1488
02:12:17,961 --> 02:12:23,058
And if you don't, it's because
he has become one with you.

1489
02:12:23,666 --> 02:12:26,726
This was the story
of my rock-star angel.

1490
02:12:26,903 --> 02:12:32,603
There was Romeo, Majnu,
Mahiwal, Ranjha...

1491
02:12:32,776 --> 02:12:35,142
...and my lone Saawariya.

1492
02:12:36,305 --> 02:12:42,463
