1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com

2
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:52,016
So what do you want to do?

3
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:55,176
I don't care, whatever

4
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:58,387
You're easy
Wanna come hang at my place?

5
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:01,517
Sure. I'll get to play with your dogs

6
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,194
I thought we were going
to your place

7
00:01:13,773 --> 00:01:15,001
Are you okay?

8
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:29,051
Just relax. Let me do all the work

9
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:33,351
That was the first time I got fucked

10
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:37,090
I never talked to him or
saw him on-line again

11
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,937
Taking it up the ass is
not as bad as you think

12
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:48,834
You get paid a lot more if you do

13
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:52,574
It's not as tiring as giving
a blow job or a hand job

14
00:01:52,745 --> 00:01:55,236
This is my favotite position

15
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,143
lying on my stomach

16
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,782
Because I don't even have
to see his face

17
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,814
I was never exactly your happy
suburban kid...

18
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:34,547
but things took a strange turn...

19
00:02:34,687 --> 00:02:37,554
when I started to explore
my sexuality on-line

20
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:41,723
That was just about a year ago
when I was still going to school

21
00:02:41,928 --> 00:02:43,589
and working at
my dad's restaurant

22
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,235
Don't forget to lock the door

23
00:02:58,545 --> 00:02:59,534
We're closed

24
00:02:59,746 --> 00:03:01,077
Bag up all the money

25
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:03,112
Okay, just chill

26
00:03:05,718 --> 00:03:06,514
What's going on?

27
00:03:06,653 --> 00:03:08,553
Give me the cash, now!

28
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:18,696
Don't look at me, you Jap!

29
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:28,870
No!

30
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:43,277
My life started to spin out of control
not long after that night

31
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:33,570
What's wrong?

32
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:39,510
Is this yours? Is this yours or not?

33
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,777
Is this what you are?

34
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,278
If I hadn't promised your mom

35
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:46,349
before she died, I'd -

36
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:47,680
Then what?

37
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:51,084
If you're really this
then you're not my son

38
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:53,020
And you gotta live
somewhere else!

39
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,464
Mom died when Noel was eight

40
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:34,895
and I was twelve

41
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:37,902
The photo is all I have of her now

42
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,539
I remember how much she loved
wearing her diamond necklace

43
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,078
It was pretty much the only thing
dad ever bought her

44
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,874
Did you think about
what we talked about?

45
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,210
What?

46
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:27,410
About you not having a home...
and maybe I could adopt you

47
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,148
Living here will be a lot better
than where you're living now

48
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,063
How was your day?

49
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:47,630
Two tricks. Bought Chinese food

50
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,774
Yummy

51
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,705
New stuff?

52
00:06:52,345 --> 00:06:55,109
I haven't tried one yet, but they're
supposed to be really good

53
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,078
I'm starving

54
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,445
Teach me how to use chopsticks?

55
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:04,347
No

56
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:10,527
When I was a little kid
I saw this kung fu movie on TV

57
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:14,963
And this guy... he could kill people
by throwing chopsticks at them

58
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,297
It was the coolest

59
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,855
You know it's unlucky
to open a fortune cookie

60
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:39,548
before you finished eating

61
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:47,958
What did you get?

62
00:07:56,676 --> 00:07:59,201
''Your prayers will be answered''

63
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:05,942
I met Remigio a couple of days
after I started working on the strip

64
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:16,890
I learned all about hustling from
talking to a couple kids on-line

65
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,028
I got paid really well because
I was just the right type

66
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:28,731
Howdy. I'm Remigio

67
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,507
What? Am I supposed
to pay you a road tax?

68
00:08:33,412 --> 00:08:35,812
Just seen you around...
thought I'd say hi

69
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:37,809
Are you a cop?

70
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:43,487
Vice squad. Just kidding

71
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:47,890
But if I were you
I wouldn't make it so obvious

72
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:50,428
Don't get dropped off on the street

73
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,860
Thanks for your advice, Remigio

74
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:56,299
Wanna smoke?

75
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:57,459
I don't smoke

76
00:08:58,704 --> 00:08:59,898
Come hang with us

77
00:09:00,106 --> 00:09:03,303
I'm tired, hungry and homeless

78
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:04,909
Will you excuse me?

79
00:09:05,444 --> 00:09:06,604
I'll buy you dinner

80
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:10,773
Why?

81
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,109
Because I dig you

82
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:15,046
It's gonna cost you

83
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,919
What are you in the mood for?

84
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:38,942
How's the sushi?

85
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:40,374
Good

86
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,355
So you're just gonna sit here
and watch me eat

87
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,896
I'm not that hungry
I'm still a little high

88
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:02,926
On what?

89
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:08,805
On E, and a little bit of coke
Ever tried it?

90
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:10,099
No

91
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,334
I make good money on it

92
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:18,345
Wow. I guess I'm supposed
to be impressed by a drug dealer

93
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,746
You're a little bitch, you know that?

94
00:10:28,394 --> 00:10:31,522
Look, I know you're scared

95
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:36,430
But trying so hard to act tough
isn't going to get you anywhere

96
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:41,869
Just be yourself
and keep your eyes open

97
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:46,804
Look, I'm going to pay for this
and I'll leave you alone

98
00:10:48,914 --> 00:10:50,108
Wait

99
00:10:55,855 --> 00:11:04,695
Do you have a place to stay?
Wanna crash at my place?

100
00:11:08,067 --> 00:11:10,831
I'm not going to fuck you
if that's what you're thinking

101
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:16,103
I know how you feel
I've been there

102
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,240
What's your name?

103
00:11:21,647 --> 00:11:26,209
Ethan. Ethan Mao

104
00:11:39,065 --> 00:11:41,192
Hey, Christina. How are you?

105
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,630
Yeah. I'll be down there
around eleven

106
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:51,508
OK. See you

107
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,641
Do you want me to come with you?

108
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,351
You really need
a good night's sleep

109
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:04,452
I feel like doing
a couple more lines

110
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:09,187
You need your rest
You haven't slept in over a day

111
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,033
Can I ask you a favor?

112
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,007
Tell me about it

113
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:28,837
I need to get some stuff
from my parents' house

114
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,413
Can you give me a ride?

115
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:32,576
Sure

116
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,339
I hate straight clubs

117
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:43,211
I'm so tired, but I can't sleep
I'll come with you

118
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:47,385
No, just stay here
I'll be back in no time

119
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:51,686
Is that really necessary?

120
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:56,094
I've been in some rough situations

121
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,341
Babe, I don't want you
to do anything tonight

122
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,505
From Miss Tina Trade herself

123
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:10,614
I'm serious

124
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,337
Mao's my mom's family name

125
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,703
Where're you from, Ethan?

126
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:42,036
Christminster. What about you?

127
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:47,244
Back east. I came down here
because I always wanted to be here

128
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,652
I also came to look for my mom

129
00:14:50,923 --> 00:14:55,053
but it's been three years and
I still haven't found her

130
00:14:57,429 --> 00:14:58,794
Were they divorced?

131
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:05,069
I was adopted. I never
knew my dad, and my mom...

132
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:08,765
Well... She gave me up
when I was really young

133
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,542
Last thing I heard was she came
down here to be an actress

134
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,480
Ethan?

135
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,488
I'm so rolling

136
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:35,317
I can tell

137
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,656
I hope you're not mad at me

138
00:16:37,863 --> 00:16:39,990
I couldn't sleep, so I tried one

139
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,099
It's really good

140
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:47,002
Oh, Ethan

141
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:58,115
I miss my mom so much
You're gonna come with me, right?

142
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,148
To my dad's house, right?

143
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:02,681
I promised

144
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,317
Will be give me a massage?

145
00:17:20,806 --> 00:17:22,433
Do you want to fuck me?

146
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:29,745
For the things you've done for me
like letting me stay here you know

147
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,906
it's okay if you want to fuck me

148
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:36,816
I don't care. Just get it over with

149
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:46,562
I don't want to fuck you, Ethan
I told you that from day one

150
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,900
Why are you so good to me?

151
00:17:57,709 --> 00:17:59,438
Do you remember Rubin?

152
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,404
That big older white guy?

153
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,715
I never told you this

154
00:18:06,885 --> 00:18:11,481
but I was his boyfriend
for almost two years

155
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:16,589
He deals higher stuff like coke

156
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,093
He set me up to do
what I'm doing now

157
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,231
So what are you trying to tell me?

158
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:29,938
I had no money, and I didn't know
anyone when I first came out here

159
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,772
I needed to be with him
you know what I mean?

160
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:42,211
He was completely in love with me
but I wasn't even attracted to him

161
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,856
How do you know you're in love?

162
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:53,460
You just feel it

163
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,558
I don't think I can ever love anyone

164
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,639
One day you will

165
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,069
I hope so

166
00:19:13,352 --> 00:19:15,547
Will you promise me something?

167
00:19:15,687 --> 00:19:16,915
What?

168
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,632
We're leaving in an hour

169
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,000
Yes, dad

170
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,182
Move it, you fag

171
00:19:54,092 --> 00:19:55,218
Asshole!

172
00:19:58,463 --> 00:19:59,760
Did you wake the boys?

173
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:02,730
Yes, M'am. Can you
put this in your purse?

174
00:20:02,901 --> 00:20:04,027
It's the jade for May

175
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,635
Of course, darling

176
00:20:05,804 --> 00:20:12,209
Please don't forget
You look lovely

177
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:18,943
Um...I'm going to make breakfast

178
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,418
Just my shake will be fine

179
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,754
Hurry up, Noel

180
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,146
Anywhere you want

181
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,791
Do you guys have
the Thanksgiving Special?

182
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:09,798
Of course. Serving it all day long
from seven A.M

183
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:11,334
I'll have one

184
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:13,603
Do you know what you want?

185
00:21:13,972 --> 00:21:15,701
I'll just have pancake

186
00:21:16,141 --> 00:21:17,768
OK. Coming up

187
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,520
Let me see

188
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:46,667
It's my little brother
He just left me the alarm code

189
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,371
Who were you calling, Noel?

190
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,044
Just a school friend

191
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,115
We gave you the cell phone
for emergency use only

192
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,712
I know. Sorry, dad

193
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:03,220
Maybe Noel has a girlfriend

194
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,322
He's too young to have a date

195
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,757
This is America, Abe. Not China

196
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:17,866
My family never
celebrates Thanksgiving

197
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:21,471
So what do they do?

198
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:24,865
They usually take a road trip
to meet some family friends

199
00:22:26,044 --> 00:22:29,241
Thanksgiving is the only day off
we have from the restaurant

200
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:35,279
My adopted mom
She made great turkeys

201
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:23,364
Did you bring the jade?

202
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,328
Of course, I did

203
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:27,732
Are you sure?

204
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,272
Yes, darling

205
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:31,936
Can you check?

206
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:39,147
Can you find it?

207
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,554
Can't we give it
to her some other time?

208
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:48,153
We see them only once a year
Can you find it?

209
00:23:48,326 --> 00:23:51,523
I'm sorry, Darling
It must have slipped my mind

210
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,630
You're not turning around
are you, Abe?

211
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:59,633
I just asked you
to do a very simple thing

212
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:01,167
Don't talk to me like that

213
00:24:01,306 --> 00:24:03,137
I'm not your servant

214
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,830
Hey, can I take care of the gun?

215
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:38,706
Sure. It's you hood

216
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,780
Wow, nice TV!

217
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:28,919
Why don't you sit here
and watch TV?

218
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:33,758
Oh, but we shouldn't
make any noise

219
00:25:34,299 --> 00:25:38,702
Good thinking. I'll pay for the cable
when we get back, all right?

220
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:43,238
Hey, do you need any help?

221
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:45,467
No, I'm cool. Won't be long

222
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,193
Noel, who do you keep calling?

223
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:10,066
Just checking the weather, Dad

224
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:12,828
Ethan?

225
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,673
Where did you leave it?

226
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:02,808
On the dressing table, I suppose

227
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,579
Get up!

228
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:28,552
Listen, Sir, I was just -

229
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,093
Put it down. Put down the photo

230
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:39,897
Raise you hands and walk
towards me out of the room

231
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:49,605
Are you alone?

232
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,142
Yes, Sir

233
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,380
Now turn around and
walk downstairs

234
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,087
Drop the gun

235
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,251
Ethan?

236
00:31:03,428 --> 00:31:05,055
I said drop the fucking gun

237
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,427
Remigio

238
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,108
What are you doing here?

239
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,808
You know, Dad, I worked for you
since I was eleven...

240
00:31:22,013 --> 00:31:23,571
and not once have I gotten paid

241
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,914
So what are you going to do?

242
00:31:26,084 --> 00:31:27,278
Just stay back

243
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:30,282
Go ahead, you faggot! I dare you!

244
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:35,819
Let him go. Let him go, Sir!

245
00:31:40,598 --> 00:31:42,293
What's going on?

246
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:44,464
I need to use the bathroom

247
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,496
I need to use the restroom too

248
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:11,551
Get up. Move

249
00:32:19,904 --> 00:32:20,996
Abe?

250
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,111
What the hell?

251
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,304
Shut up, Josh

252
00:32:30,481 --> 00:32:31,846
Just do what he says

253
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,811
Ethan, what are you doing?

254
00:32:34,052 --> 00:32:36,577
This ingrate has come back
to rob us

255
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:38,221
You're gonna fry for this

256
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,961
You think I'm still going
to take your shit?

257
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:49,031
Ethan, no

258
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,595
For all the years you've
been shitting on me and Noel

259
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:53,768
I really feel like blowing
your brains out right now

260
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:54,802
Ethan, he's your brother

261
00:32:54,939 --> 00:32:55,963
You mustn't hurt him

262
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:02,178
My brother? He's not my brother
He never treated me like one

263
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,711
And you are a back-stabbing bitch

264
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:11,147
Look at me
Look me in the eyes and...

265
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:13,814
tell me you didn't take that
magazine from my room

266
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,886
I just found it, Ethan

267
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:27,096
My mother loved you and
worked for you all her life and...

268
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,432
you treated her like a dog

269
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:30,731
This woman is a leech

270
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,842
and you treated her like a queen

271
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:34,802
What do you see in her?

272
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:36,780
Don't talk to me like this

273
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,449
I talk to you however
the fuck I please

274
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:42,484
You've got our money. Now leave

275
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:47,953
Don't you ever come back again
or I'll kill you, you monster

276
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:57,263
Maybe I'm a monster
But I didn't ask to be born

277
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,706
And one more thing
I want my mom's necklace back

278
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,806
It isn't worth anything

279
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:07,274
It's not yours. Where is it?

280
00:34:07,512 --> 00:34:11,881
It's not here. It's in the safety
deposit box at the bank

281
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:15,584
It's Thanksgiving, Ethan

282
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:22,653
Well, then. We just have
to wait till tomorrow morning

283
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,953
Get it first thing, and we'll leave

284
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:29,966
But until we're gone, you'll all
listen to me for a change

285
00:34:33,971 --> 00:34:35,563
Honey, let me take a look

286
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,072
You don't have to look
Mom. I feel fine

287
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,274
So Ethan, how've you been?

288
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,611
I'm still breathing

289
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,143
We haven't heard
from you in months

290
00:34:48,319 --> 00:34:50,514
We're all very worried about you

291
00:34:50,655 --> 00:34:51,485
I don't know what happened

292
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:52,987
between you and your father -

293
00:34:53,124 --> 00:34:56,059
You knew exactly what happened

294
00:34:56,461 --> 00:34:59,294
You couldn't wait to show him
the magazine, could you?

295
00:34:59,497 --> 00:35:01,089
Whatever happened, Ethan

296
00:35:01,232 --> 00:35:03,632
let's just put it all behind us

297
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:05,692
You are part of the family

298
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:07,062
Fuck you!

299
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,040
Abraham, talk to your son

300
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,197
About what?

301
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:23,812
You're scared, aren't you? You're
scared for yourself and your baby

302
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:26,789
Ethan, there has been a great deal
of misunderstanding between...

303
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,755
all of us. It shouldn't
have come to this

304
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,588
Just shut up, bitch!

305
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,628
I need to take a crap

306
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:34,787
So?

307
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,596
So can I use the bathroom?

308
00:35:38,669 --> 00:35:39,727
Please?

309
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:41,838
Please, your majesty

310
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:45,868
Go. Downstairs

311
00:36:07,064 --> 00:36:08,088
Shit!

312
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,701
Motherfucker!

313
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,198
Watch them

314
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:21,277
I'm gonna fucking shoot you
if you're on your cell phone

315
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:23,346
Open the door!

316
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:39,393
Stop!

317
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:47,798
C'mon, Ethan. We've never gotten
a chance to do this man-to-man

318
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,373
Remigio!

319
00:37:02,019 --> 00:37:03,145
Dad!

320
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:05,016
I'm fine

321
00:37:08,292 --> 00:37:09,054
Get up!

322
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:09,955
Why did you shoot Dad?

323
00:37:10,127 --> 00:37:11,094
He was trying to kill us

324
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:17,132
I said get up. Now move

325
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,266
Oh my God, Abe
What happened?

326
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:25,432
My son shot me

327
00:37:25,943 --> 00:37:27,570
Josh, Josh! Are you all right?

328
00:37:27,778 --> 00:37:29,939
Yeah. I'm all right, Mom

329
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:31,671
Just don't hurt my son

330
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,339
He started it all

331
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:35,348
I've got to get some
bandages for Dad

332
00:37:36,721 --> 00:37:37,688
Go!

333
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:46,987
Everyone stays still

334
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:03,705
It's Mrs Harvisham
What the fuck does she want?

335
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,813
I'll deal with her

336
00:38:05,983 --> 00:38:08,349
Noel, go take care of her

337
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,232
Do you know what day this is?

338
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:26,396
It's Thanksgiving

339
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:32,873
Exactly. This is a very
important national holiday

340
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:35,638
So if you could please
keep the noise level down

341
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:39,147
which means no banging
no screaming

342
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:44,084
And please don't play your Hong
Kong action movies too loud

343
00:38:45,756 --> 00:38:48,350
Do you understand?

344
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:50,651
Yes, Mrs Harvisham

345
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:51,955
Good day!

346
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:56,932
She's gone. Where's Ethan?

347
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,832
He'll be right back

348
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:03,064
And I suggested all of you
turn in your cell phones

349
00:39:11,148 --> 00:39:12,115
And you?

350
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:23,283
Gracias

351
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,231
Josh, honey

352
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:31,766
Leave me alone, Mom

353
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:34,334
Don't talk to your mother like this

354
00:39:34,572 --> 00:39:37,473
She's my mom
And I talk to her the way I want

355
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,708
Besides you're not my father

356
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:43,070
Josh, I love you

357
00:39:43,848 --> 00:39:48,410
I know, Mom. And I don't have
to hear it all the time

358
00:39:51,288 --> 00:39:52,585
Will you help me tie them up?

359
00:39:53,424 --> 00:39:54,448
If that's what you want

360
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,352
Ethan, take the money

361
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,993
and tomorrow morning
we'll get you the necklace

362
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:00,955
I hope a gag won't be necessary

363
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:14,437
Why are you doing this to us?

364
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:16,211
Because I feel like it

365
00:40:18,516 --> 00:40:19,915
Sarah!

366
00:40:20,284 --> 00:40:23,219
This is all your fault
Your son is a psycho

367
00:40:24,155 --> 00:40:28,558
You've made your point
Please don't put us through this

368
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,757
I don't trust you anymore

369
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,562
I have to pee

370
00:40:34,765 --> 00:40:36,630
Piss in your pants

371
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:40,930
Look Ethan, I may be an asshole
But I don't lie

372
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:45,500
You have my word that
I won't do anything stupid

373
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,540
and I'll make sure
no one else does

374
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:51,546
I will untie you when I feel like it

375
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,847
Now that I have
everyone's attention

376
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:58,246
you better call Aunty May
and tell her...

377
00:40:58,422 --> 00:41:00,447
that you guys aren't going
to make it to Roy Town

378
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:03,092
How did you know we were
going to Roy Town today?

379
00:41:05,229 --> 00:41:09,063
Just a guess
Roy Town is your favorite place

380
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,865
Noel, you called him

381
00:41:14,038 --> 00:41:16,336
with the alarm code in the car
didn't you?

382
00:41:16,507 --> 00:41:17,838
Yes, he did

383
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,373
Noel...I'll kill you -

384
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:23,513
If any of you touches a strand
of my brother's hair

385
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:27,309
I'll hunt you down and
put a bullet in your head

386
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:28,985
He's my son

387
00:41:29,186 --> 00:41:32,883
I work all my life to put a roof
over my children's head

388
00:41:33,057 --> 00:41:37,619
put them through school
give them what they need...

389
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,629
I don't know what more
they want from me

390
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:48,332
For you, all there is is money
That's all your children need

391
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:49,837
They just need your money

392
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,770
And that's exactly what I'm here for

393
00:41:51,909 --> 00:41:54,104
Your stinking money

394
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:00,014
I need to use the bathroom

395
00:42:00,217 --> 00:42:02,447
I said, ''Piss in your pants, bitch!''

396
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:37,615
Feeling better?

397
00:42:42,459 --> 00:42:45,451
You call Aunty May and
make it sound good

398
00:42:54,271 --> 00:42:57,729
Hello May...it's Abe here

399
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:04,473
Yes, something came up and
we're not coming over anymore

400
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:16,926
Yeah. Sarah's not feeling well
Yeah...okay... I'm sorry. Hold on

401
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,322
She wants to talk to you

402
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:38,707
Hi, May. I got a really
bad stomachache

403
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,744
We'll give it to you
some other time

404
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:49,919
Listen, say hi to Chuen for me
and have fun. And Ethan

405
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:00,799
Ethan, you have
humiliated us enough

406
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,941
They got the point

407
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:09,811
I don't know what more
you want from us

408
00:44:10,948 --> 00:44:13,382
We'll give you what you came for

409
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:16,549
And we'll listen to all your

410
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,689
reasonable demands
in the meantime

411
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:25,851
But please, untie us!
Do we have a deal?

412
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:27,888
Fine

413
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,595
I want your word

414
00:44:30,768 --> 00:44:32,463
You have my word

415
00:44:33,203 --> 00:44:35,330
So this is a done deal

416
00:44:36,306 --> 00:44:41,403
And no one is gonna
do anyhting contrary. Josh?

417
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,704
You have my word

418
00:44:43,447 --> 00:44:48,680
Sarah? And Noel?

419
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:52,949
Yes, Dad

420
00:44:53,824 --> 00:44:57,885
Tomorrow, only one of you goes

421
00:44:58,929 --> 00:45:00,624
Well it has to be Sarah

422
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,631
The safety deposit box
is under her name

423
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,959
Don't worry. I'll give it to you...

424
00:45:05,135 --> 00:45:05,931
it's not worth anything

425
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:07,536
Don't you get it?

426
00:45:07,738 --> 00:45:16,976
It's not how much it's worth
It's all I have of her

427
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:27,983
So everyone understands
and is going to abide by this deal

428
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,220
Including you

429
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,561
Don't worry
I want nothing from you guys

430
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,165
I'm only here because of Ethan

431
00:45:37,701 --> 00:45:40,602
But if any of you comes
at me with a knife again

432
00:45:40,771 --> 00:45:45,071
I'll have no problem
in shooting him or her

433
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:51,512
May I please go and
change now, Ethan?

434
00:45:53,617 --> 00:46:00,580
Yes. But Remigio
is going with you

435
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,562
I'm hungry

436
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:14,099
Can I cook something
for them to eat?

437
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:25,114
Yes, you may. Why don't you
clean up your mom's mess?

438
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:30,550
What's your name?

439
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:31,745
Remigio

440
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,287
That's unique. My name is Sarah

441
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:36,982
So Romeo
how did you meet Ethan?

442
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:39,186
I'll leave that up to your imagination

443
00:46:47,871 --> 00:46:49,634
I need some privacy

444
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,641
Use the bathroom. And please
don't try anything stupid

445
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:56,102
Oh my my...you don't trust me?

446
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:57,610
I don't know you

447
00:46:58,081 --> 00:47:00,208
Well, I'm not a wicked stepmom

448
00:47:14,565 --> 00:47:16,157
I was an actress

449
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,630
My mom was an actress

450
00:47:20,904 --> 00:47:22,599
If I hadn't devoted my life
to my son...

451
00:47:22,773 --> 00:47:24,832
I would have been
the next Meryl Streep

452
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:33,375
How're you doing?

453
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,177
Just fine, darling

454
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:37,244
Mom's going to help me

455
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:52,267
Noel, why don't you go play
video games with Remigio?

456
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,835
You know I hate video games

457
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:57,702
Noel, just go. I'll stay here

458
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:02,875
I owe you

459
00:48:10,954 --> 00:48:13,946
Wow, you guys have
so many cool games

460
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,622
You don't like to
play video games?

461
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,889
They're all Josh's

462
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,197
So what do you like to do?

463
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:26,135
I like novels and movies

464
00:48:27,104 --> 00:48:28,298
What are you reading now?

465
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:33,776
A few books at a time
One is Frankenstein

466
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:41,409
Hey, Ethan, can I call Vicky?

467
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:43,075
I promised to call her today

468
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:56,424
Hey, Vicks. It's me

469
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,729
Just calling to say hi and

470
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:01,598
hope you're having
a good Thanksgiving

471
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:03,867
Give me a call back
when you get a chance

472
00:49:04,074 --> 00:49:06,201
I'll talk to you later. Okay, bye

473
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:09,906
I thought you and Vicky broke up

474
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,776
I mean she's so far away

475
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,215
You need a girlfriend here

476
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:20,185
Besides I think you can do
much better than her

477
00:49:24,661 --> 00:49:25,821
It's Vicky!

478
00:49:26,763 --> 00:49:27,821
Go ahead

479
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:33,764
Hello, how're you doing, baby?

480
00:49:35,372 --> 00:49:38,205
I'm cool, just hanging with
my folks right now

481
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:42,103
We cancelled the trip and
decided to stay home

482
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:47,108
So... you're having a good
Thanksgiving with your aunt?

483
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:53,452
Cool. Well I just call
to say I love you

484
00:49:55,025 --> 00:50:00,053
Okay, I'll talk to you later

485
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:04,200
Bye. Thanks

486
00:50:07,804 --> 00:50:09,271
She isn't home this Thanksgiving?

487
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:13,000
No...she's in Boston with her aunt

488
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:16,504
I'm actually going to
go out there next year

489
00:50:16,713 --> 00:50:19,273
You're not going out there

490
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:24,051
You know what, Mom?
I'm twenty years old now

491
00:50:24,221 --> 00:50:27,019
I can get up and walk right now
so don't push me

492
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,920
Oh really? And how're you going
to support yourself?

493
00:50:30,093 --> 00:50:31,117
You've never had a job

494
00:50:31,294 --> 00:50:33,159
Not one in your entire life

495
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,354
Watch me

496
00:50:34,698 --> 00:50:35,687
Oh, go ahead

497
00:50:35,832 --> 00:50:38,699
You just go ahead and
leave me here to rot

498
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,996
I'm going to play video games
Is that cool?

499
00:50:42,272 --> 00:50:43,136
All right

500
00:50:47,978 --> 00:50:50,503
You use these to use
your special skills

501
00:50:51,081 --> 00:50:52,639
Like that?

502
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:56,818
And you press these two buttons
for your back flip

503
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:05,094
Hey. Mind if I join you guys?

504
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:10,491
Oh... go ahead. You can play
I'll just watch

505
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:14,602
We can play teams. I'll tag with
Noel since he isn't that good

506
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:19,739
Don't get dehydrated

507
00:51:21,445 --> 00:51:24,573
I hope you're taking care
of yourself out there, Ethan

508
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,441
Can I ask you a question?

509
00:51:28,885 --> 00:51:30,011
What?

510
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:35,115
We used to be able to talk
you and I. What happened?

511
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,791
I mean I've tried the best
I could to take care of you

512
00:51:40,997 --> 00:51:42,464
Take care of me

513
00:51:42,833 --> 00:51:43,959
I've worked in my dad's restaurant

514
00:51:44,134 --> 00:51:47,035
since I was eleven
to support you and your son

515
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,569
Have you even worked one day
in that restaurant?

516
00:51:49,706 --> 00:51:53,506
Ethan, I didn't marry your father
to be some kind of slave

517
00:51:53,710 --> 00:51:54,574
I love your father

518
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:57,611
and I brought my own money
into this marriage

519
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:02,282
You've gotten things quite twisted
If you think things were hard on you

520
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:04,613
imagine how I felt when I first came

521
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:06,085
You never even gave me a chance

522
00:52:06,289 --> 00:52:08,621
You wouldn't even looked me
in the eyes for the first year

523
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,783
How do you think I felt?

524
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:15,526
I just lost my mom
And you waltzed right in

525
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:18,029
You wouldn't even acknowledge
my presence

526
00:52:18,168 --> 00:52:19,499
You were trying to control me

527
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,970
Well! It turned out none
of us could control you, Ethan

528
00:52:24,207 --> 00:52:27,608
Youre out of control
And you're not a kid anymore

529
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:29,472
You're a criminal

530
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,416
Oh, back flip!

531
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,676
So what do you do?

532
00:52:36,953 --> 00:52:40,116
I sell stuff. This and that

533
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,548
What do you sell?

534
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:42,749
Vitamins

535
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:44,693
What kind of vitamins?

536
00:52:44,928 --> 00:52:47,988
Oh... crystal, E, K & G

537
00:52:48,131 --> 00:52:49,257
Seriously?

538
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,696
Yeah, just for the time being
To get by

539
00:52:52,969 --> 00:52:56,132
So do you think I can buy some E
off you when this is all over?

540
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:57,637
You mean ecstasy?

541
00:52:57,974 --> 00:52:59,407
Shut up!

542
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,473
Well, a few of my friends
do it at raves

543
00:53:02,646 --> 00:53:06,639
I mean... It's supposed to make
you mildly intoxicated and relaxed...

544
00:53:06,816 --> 00:53:10,377
and energetic with a general
sense of wellbeing, right?

545
00:53:10,587 --> 00:53:11,986
You're such a nerd

546
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,958
Why don't you tell the kids
the food is ready?

547
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:24,364
How're you doing?

548
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:26,160
I'll live

549
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:33,302
Dinner's ready!

550
00:53:33,777 --> 00:53:34,835
Pause!

551
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:40,409
You guys go ahead
I want to talk to Noel for a minute

552
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:44,744
It'd be better if you came with us
Let's go

553
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:53,352
I'm gonna go get something
else to drink

554
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,225
Hey can you get me a juice?

555
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,964
Yo, Ethan!

556
00:53:59,603 --> 00:54:00,900
Can I have one too?

557
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:04,537
Josh, please. Stop throwing things

558
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,011
In our family, we say grace

559
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:13,672
You don't have to
if you don't want to...

560
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:16,910
but I'd like to have a moment
of silence

561
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:24,190
Dear God, I want to thank you
for giving us life...

562
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:28,923
and all the food on the table
on this difficult day

563
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:32,967
I pray that you guide us
through these hours...

564
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:39,602
and we pray that you
forgive Ethan's sins. Amen

565
00:54:39,809 --> 00:54:41,003
Amen

566
00:54:44,648 --> 00:54:49,676
Ethan, your father has made
your favorite dish

567
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:54,283
I'll get you a fork

568
00:54:54,724 --> 00:54:59,752
Wait. I want to use chopsticks
Just show me how

569
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:03,490
Oh, I'll show you how
I mean it's really easy

570
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:11,339
You hold one like this
and the other one like this

571
00:55:12,609 --> 00:55:14,474
Ok

572
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:18,074
You got it?

573
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:19,608
Fair enough

574
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:43,435
It's still kind of bleeding
You okay, dad?

575
00:55:47,243 --> 00:55:50,804
Noel, will you help me
get some blankets...

576
00:55:50,947 --> 00:55:52,778
and pillows when you're done?

577
00:56:07,797 --> 00:56:09,560
I'm gonna go help Ethan

578
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,096
I'm sorry, Noel

579
00:56:17,807 --> 00:56:22,141
I'm sorry all this had to happen
I really didn't know

580
00:56:23,513 --> 00:56:25,845
I just hope Dad's gonna be fine

581
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:30,085
He's tough. He'll be fine

582
00:56:30,787 --> 00:56:34,416
I know he'd never say it
But he cares about you

583
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,318
He cares more about money

584
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,427
He'd sell any of us out for money

585
00:56:40,663 --> 00:56:42,324
That's what I hate about him

586
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:51,439
So Remigio seems cool
So are you...

587
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:52,939
We're just friends

588
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:58,273
You ever think of coming home?

589
00:57:02,051 --> 00:57:03,518
It's too late now

590
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,091
I need to change

591
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,962
Romeo, why don't you
watch over me?

592
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:41,617
Your mother must be
very beautiful

593
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:44,526
I don't remember
what she looks like

594
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:47,492
I was only three
when she gave me up

595
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:52,067
I know she is, because you're
a very handsome young man

596
00:57:57,640 --> 00:57:59,870
You're in love with Ethan
aren't you?

597
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:01,736
I can tell

598
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:08,009
Have you ever been
with a woman before?

599
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:13,351
You have a very firm grip, Remigio

600
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:17,584
Stop fucking with my mind
and go get dressed

601
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:25,492
Or what? You're gonna shoot me?

602
00:58:52,495 --> 00:58:54,087
How are you holding up?

603
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:58,667
I'm finally coming down

604
00:59:01,237 --> 00:59:03,671
Tomorrow when this is all over

605
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:06,240
I'll do whatever you want

606
00:59:07,810 --> 00:59:13,749
You don't have to do anything
We're friends

607
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:21,520
You're probably the only friend
I've had for a long time

608
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:45,604
We'll take turns watching them
Take a nap

609
00:59:48,685 --> 00:59:50,118
Are you sure?

610
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,024
I'll wake you up when
I start getting asleep

611
00:59:59,929 --> 01:00:05,299
Thanks. For everything

612
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:34,924
Where am I?

613
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,124
We're here in my apartment

614
01:00:42,872 --> 01:00:48,003
I just dreamt that I was
at my dad's house with you

615
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:51,573
And all these awful things
started to happen

616
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,512
At least you slept
for a couple of hours

617
01:01:01,057 --> 01:01:03,048
Can I ask you a weird question?

618
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:11,990
If you had to die tomorrow
what would you have done today?

619
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:21,236
If I had to die tomorrow...
I'd still do what I did

620
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:28,811
I'd still be here, with you, right now

621
01:01:37,827 --> 01:01:38,987
Are you okay?

622
01:01:39,128 --> 01:01:44,498
Yeah. Sorry to have to woke you
Go back to sleep

623
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:21,191
Are you okay?

624
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:28,926
Yeah. I'm scared

625
01:03:30,940 --> 01:03:34,774
We'll be out of here soon
I promise

626
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:50,820
I need to go to the bathroom

627
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:41,701
Dear God, please let me live
and die without regret

628
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:43,268
Hey, are you done?

629
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:45,232
It's all yours

630
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,380
Hey...just gonna get some water

631
01:05:57,320 --> 01:05:58,446
Can't sleep

632
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:05,424
No... not really. Water?

633
01:06:06,829 --> 01:06:07,921
Sure

634
01:06:31,954 --> 01:06:34,855
I know there's been bad blood
between us for a long time

635
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:39,190
But I don't really have
anything against you

636
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:43,722
You're a smart guy, Ethan

637
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,368
You should go to college
for something

638
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:52,769
Whatever. I just want
to get out of here

639
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,138
Thirsty?

640
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:05,452
So Remigio says
he can hook me up

641
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,150
You know...

642
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:13,859
Josh, you should be careful

643
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:19,190
Just once in a while. E
Not a big deal

644
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,933
Actually I want to do it
with Vicky once

645
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:26,874
Yeah. That'll be fun

646
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:30,940
Hey man, you know what?
I have some in my car

647
01:07:31,113 --> 01:07:32,444
I'll give you a couple

648
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:33,170
Serious?

649
01:07:33,349 --> 01:07:34,338
Yeah

650
01:07:55,538 --> 01:08:00,441
All right, man. These are very pure
and potent. They're capsules

651
01:08:00,810 --> 01:08:02,004
No shit

652
01:08:02,578 --> 01:08:03,704
Have fun

653
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:08,475
Thanks. I'll pay you something

654
01:08:08,617 --> 01:08:09,948
Don't worry about it, man
Seriously

655
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:12,553
Just have a good time
with your girlfriend

656
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:15,281
I so approve of your boyfriend
Ethan

657
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,891
We're just friends

658
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,958
I'm just playing with you, bro

659
01:08:21,797 --> 01:08:26,166
Listen, Josh, if somehting
happens to me...

660
01:08:27,369 --> 01:08:29,701
will you keep an eye
for Noel for me?

661
01:08:32,208 --> 01:08:33,368
Will

662
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:49,917
What happened?

663
01:08:50,226 --> 01:08:52,490
My nightgown from Saks

664
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:57,958
The dressing must
have gotten loose over night

665
01:08:58,167 --> 01:08:59,361
He bled quite a bit

666
01:09:00,002 --> 01:09:01,162
How are you feeling?

667
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:05,672
I'm all right. Sarah, go get
changed and go to the bank

668
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,206
We need to take Dad
to the hospital

669
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:09,468
Not until I get what I want

670
01:09:09,678 --> 01:09:12,010
Get changed and go to the bank

671
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,581
You want to kill your father
don't you?

672
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:19,078
Noel, go get some
bandages and towels

673
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:33,692
What are you doing?

674
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:35,200
I go cook breakfast

675
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:36,998
Just sit and relax, Dad

676
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:38,467
This is my house

677
01:09:38,674 --> 01:09:40,335
Let me do what I have to do

678
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:54,748
Listen, just go to the bank...

679
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:57,983
get the necklace and we can put
all of this behind us

680
01:09:58,127 --> 01:10:01,460
Don't worry. I have absolutely
no use for it

681
01:10:02,798 --> 01:10:05,426
if you think it's worth anything
you're wrong

682
01:10:06,468 --> 01:10:08,800
You just don't get the point
do you?

683
01:10:09,171 --> 01:10:13,301
No, I get it. You don't think
you have to work

684
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:14,902
You think you two can just

685
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,738
rob innocent people
of all the things...

686
01:10:16,912 --> 01:10:19,608
they've worked hard
to earn all their lives

687
01:10:20,916 --> 01:10:23,441
I hope you two get AIDS and die

688
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:27,554
Well, I hope you'll be happier

689
01:10:27,756 --> 01:10:30,884
Trust me. I am happy

690
01:10:31,961 --> 01:10:34,930
I just pity all you pathetic losers

691
01:10:40,402 --> 01:10:42,962
Oh, Sarah. I'm sorry
I forgot your shake

692
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,572
I'm fine, Darling
I'm going to the bank

693
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:47,766
I'll be back in half an hour

694
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,575
Do you want me to go with her?

695
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:52,180
No. She'll be back

696
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:56,511
If not, I'll just blow
her son's brains out

697
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:37,942
My stepson is a homosexual
and psychopath

698
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,906
Where is she?

699
01:13:05,180 --> 01:13:07,239
The bank is only five minutes away

700
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,073
Take it easy, Ethan

701
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:15,781
I have a bad feeling about this

702
01:13:20,062 --> 01:13:21,689
I'm going to see who it is

703
01:13:24,933 --> 01:13:30,565
Hello. No. Dad

704
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:31,706
Who's it?

705
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:33,740
I don't know

706
01:13:33,976 --> 01:13:35,068
Calm down, Ethan

707
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,836
don't fuck with me!

708
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:39,572
she will be back and
let me see who it is

709
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:49,383
Yes. Yes. He wants to talk to you

710
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:50,525
Who is it?

711
01:13:50,993 --> 01:13:52,290
It's the police

712
01:13:58,934 --> 01:13:59,764
Yes?

713
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:02,062
This is Sheriff Black
How're you doing?

714
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,306
Listen, we have the
house surrounded

715
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:08,204
I want you and your friends
to come out with your hands up...

716
01:14:08,377 --> 01:14:13,076
any weapons in the air. Let's get
this over with, so no one gets hurt

717
01:14:13,248 --> 01:14:14,510
I'll give you five minutes

718
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:15,981
Fuck you!

719
01:14:19,254 --> 01:14:20,778
You lied to me

720
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:22,184
I didn't lie to you

721
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:24,154
Ethan, take it easy, dude

722
01:14:25,327 --> 01:14:26,851
You told her to call the cops

723
01:14:27,029 --> 01:14:28,929
You think I don't have
the guts to kill you?

724
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:40,736
I didn't know anything about this
If that's what you want, go ahead

725
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:42,342
Ethan, no!

726
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,068
I told you, Noel

727
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,304
I told he'd sell us out for money

728
01:14:46,515 --> 01:14:48,312
Please don't hurt Dad

729
01:14:48,884 --> 01:14:50,818
Get out of the way, Noel

730
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:58,749
I'm sorry about that night

731
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:04,993
It's too late. It's too late
for you to say that

732
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:07,968
But you're my son

733
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:10,202
Nothing can change that

734
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:14,172
When I left that morning
I was no longer your son

735
01:15:17,779 --> 01:15:19,542
I don't care if I die

736
01:15:19,715 --> 01:15:22,707
If that's God's will, let it be

737
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:25,881
But I just don't want you to get hurt

738
01:15:26,321 --> 01:15:28,653
I don't want you to get
in more trouble

739
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:37,556
You didn't have to kill that kid, Dad

740
01:16:00,289 --> 01:16:01,256
Ethan?

741
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:03,447
No, this is Remigio

742
01:16:03,592 --> 01:16:04,820
How can I help you, Remigio?

743
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,723
Listen, maybe Ethan isn't going
to shoot his family

744
01:16:07,896 --> 01:16:08,658
I may

745
01:16:08,864 --> 01:16:10,092
So I suggest you
don't make a move

746
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:11,960
until we've agreed on something

747
01:16:12,167 --> 01:16:13,134
What do you want?

748
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:14,558
Thirty minutes

749
01:16:14,770 --> 01:16:16,601
And I'll call you back
with demands

750
01:16:17,205 --> 01:16:19,298
So that makes it ten thirteen?

751
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:22,399
Ten thirteen sharp

752
01:16:29,017 --> 01:16:30,314
I was just buying
ourselves some time

753
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:32,350
so we could think of something

754
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:35,089
Noel, I need your help

755
01:16:42,931 --> 01:16:44,228
Promise I won't hurt you

756
01:16:44,399 --> 01:16:45,866
Josh, will you call the sheriff back...

757
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:48,935
and tell him to look outside
the dining room window? Act scared

758
01:16:52,341 --> 01:16:53,365
Yes?

759
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:54,702
Sheriff Black?

760
01:16:54,876 --> 01:16:55,968
Who am I speaking with?

761
01:16:56,178 --> 01:17:00,376
This is Josh. He told you to look at
the window in the dining room

762
01:17:03,418 --> 01:17:04,316
Are you okay?

763
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:06,187
Yeah

764
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:15,689
The good news is
the SWAT team isn't here yet

765
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:24,870
Bad news...there're five police
cars and cops with rifles

766
01:17:25,407 --> 01:17:26,965
Why did you do that?

767
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:29,911
So that they'll take us seriously
and...

768
01:17:30,112 --> 01:17:31,773
You didn't have to get involved

769
01:17:32,748 --> 01:17:34,841
I got involved
when I came with you

770
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:40,513
Think about what
you want to do, Ethan

771
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:43,950
Son, you've got
to do the right thing

772
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:45,593
What is the right thing?

773
01:17:45,761 --> 01:17:50,198
We'll help you. We'll get a lawyer
for you and everything will be fine

774
01:17:50,365 --> 01:17:51,696
What about Remigio?

775
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:54,698
We'll get a lawyer to represent
both of you

776
01:17:55,203 --> 01:17:57,467
You've got to do the right thing now

777
01:17:57,639 --> 01:18:00,335
Be sensible guys
you can't get away

778
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:04,941
Shut up. Just shut up, everybody

779
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:13,151
Ethan, don't!

780
01:18:13,655 --> 01:18:14,781
It's over!

781
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:15,979
Please don't!

782
01:18:16,091 --> 01:18:17,854
Ethan, we'll do anything
to help you

783
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:35,102
Listen to be... babe, it's okay

784
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:53,017
Dad, I'm sorry!

785
01:18:55,731 --> 01:18:57,631
I'm glad you came home

786
01:19:02,804 --> 01:19:04,271
What do you want to do?

787
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:09,504
I don't know. What do you want?

788
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:31,728
I have an idea. I'm just going
to go out there and turn myself in

789
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:36,361
I'm going to tell them that I force
you to take me to your home and..

790
01:19:36,538 --> 01:19:37,732
I told you to rob your family

791
01:19:37,906 --> 01:19:38,998
What?

792
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:46,274
It'll be easier. You'll be okay
and you'll come off clean

793
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:47,846
You can't

794
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:52,075
Listen, you don't have it that bad

795
01:19:52,287 --> 01:19:56,951
There's still a lot of love for you
and you can't take that for granted

796
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:58,683
No!

797
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:12,706
Let go!

798
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:19,808
You goddamn brat, don't you get it?
They love you

799
01:20:27,956 --> 01:20:36,295
I didn't mean to hit you
Look, I'll do some time...

800
01:20:36,431 --> 01:20:43,166
a few years max...take care...
I'll see you again

801
01:20:43,371 --> 01:20:45,339
But you didn't do anything

802
01:20:48,710 --> 01:20:51,372
Not everyone get
a second chance, Ethan

803
01:20:51,546 --> 01:20:54,071
I wish I had a second chance

804
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,074
I can't owe you more

805
01:20:56,251 --> 01:21:00,381
For the past few months
you were living with me...

806
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:03,980
I had the best time of my life

807
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:06,960
I was just using you

808
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:13,433
I was happy
That was all that mattered

809
01:22:37,852 --> 01:22:40,946
When I closed my eyes and
tried to blow my brains out...

810
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:43,951
the only person
I could see was you...

811
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:48,522
and I couldn't do it because
I'd really miss you

812
01:22:49,431 --> 01:22:53,299
If I let you go out there alone
I'd regret it for the rest of my life

813
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:00,902
Let's do it together

814
01:23:04,079 --> 01:23:05,671
Are you sure?

815
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:11,146
Ethan!

816
01:23:19,728 --> 01:23:21,195
I love you

817
01:23:21,396 --> 01:23:22,727
I love you too

818
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:10,027
Ethan, will you
promise me something?

819
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:11,365
What?

820
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:20,313
When you do fall in love, will you
let me know no matter where I am?

821
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:28,885
Sure. You'll be the first person
I kiss...

822
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:31,115
If I ever love anyone

823
01:25:32,305 --> 01:25:38,250
