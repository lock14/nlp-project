- Good morning.
- Hey.
- Good morning.
- Hey.
- Hey.
- Hi.
- Dean Daniels?
- That'd be me.
- I got a note in my box that
said you wanted to see me.
- I sent out a lot of notes.
I need you to tell me your name.
- Oh, sorry.
Patrick Chibas.
- Oh, Patrick.
Great.
Come on in.
How was your summer?
- I waited tables
at this fusion place
in the East Village.
- Good money?
- Yeah.
Am I in trouble?
- No, no.
Not at all. No.
You declared
an environmental sciences major
last spring?
- Yeah.
- Well, we have a scholarship
that's designated for--
well, it's designated
for an outstanding
minority student
in environmental sciences,
and I just wondered
if you might be interested.
- Sure.
- Well,
there's just one thing then.
I need to ask you, Patrick,
On your Belmont application,
you--
well,
under the voluntary disclosure
of your racial/ethnic
background,
you marked "other."
- Yeah.
I'm New Yorican.
- New Yorican?
- Yeah.
A New Yorker
of Puerto Rican descent.
- Right.
Do you think--
uh...
would it be fair
for me to say, then,
that you're hispanic?
- What's wrong
with New Yorican?
- Well, nothing,
of course.
- Then why don't you
just say that?
- Because the scholarship
committee is--
well, they're not
culturally sensitive,
if you know what I mean.
- No.
- They're old,
and, just trust me on this,
the simpler the better
with these folks.
- You do understand
why I don't want
to be called hispanic,
don't you?
- Well, as I understand it,
and correct me,
please, if I'm wrong,
it's because
it really only refers
to imperialists
of European descent
who colonized Puerto Rico.
- Yeah, I mean,
if you understand, then--
- Then why am I suggesting it?
That's a good question.
You're right.
I shouldn't compromise
your feelings
for the sake of expediency.
I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
- How about
just plain Puerto Rican?
- No.
- It's a $12,000 scholarship,
Patrick.
- It is?
- You are a remarkably talented
student, Patrick,
and I think
you should be rewarded
in a meaningful way.
- You can put "Puerto Rican."
- Thank you.
- # and that was just the way #
# you play the game #
- Fuck.
- Dean Daniels.
- Yeah.
- I'm Nathan Glazer, the R.A.
Security's waiting inside.
- And the student?
- Yeah.
- What's his name?
- Simon Brick.
- Thanks.
- They're right in here.
- And neither of you guys heard
anything last night?
Hey.
- Oh, hello.
Sarah, this is Jason...
- Thorn.
- He found the note.
- You must be Simon.
- How'd you guess?
- I'm Sarah Daniels,
the Dean of Students.
Are you okay?
- I guess.
- What did the note say?
Uh, notes, plural.
- He found
the other one last week.
- Why didn't you tell someone?
- I just figured
some asshole put 'em there.
- That's an understatement.
This is serious shit.
- I didn't want
to make a big deal.
I just got here.
I don't want everyone
to know who I am like that.
- So you don't have a roommate?
- I live next door.
- No, this is a single.
- Did you request it?
- Yeah.
- You're lucky, man.
My roommate stinks,
literally.
His--his feet--
- Okay.
More to the point...
we're gonna find out
who did this,
and we're gonna put an end
to it.
Would you like
to talk to somebody,
maybe go see one
of the counselors
over at Student Health?
- You know,
I think I'd really just like
to go to class.
- If there's anything
that I can do,
call me.
Thank you.
Thanks.
- Has anyone had a run-in
with Simon?
- The opposite.
Everybody seems to like him.
I made a point of asking him
to meals the first week
since he didn't have a roommate.
He's real shy.
- Okay.
Well, call us if you think
of anything.
- You could, uh, put guards
at the doors
is something I thought of.
- Yeah, I'd have to clear it
with President Garvey.
And tell your freshmen not
to prop the doors open, hmm?
- Thanks, Nathan.
Let's make copies
of those notes,
and then you can give
the originals to the police.
- You want me
to call the police?
- Of course.
What?
- President Garvey will want
to handle it internally.
- He's being threatened.
- It's up to you.
- Call the police.
- Yes, ma'am.
- These winter term classes
are an embarrassment.
Wine tasting?
The films of Brigitte Bardot?
- I teach that.
- Well, we can't be
too demanding
in the winter term.
- Why not?
- Because it is one month
in the winter,
and that's when they all ski,
all right?
67% of students surveyed said
the ski slopes
were a deciding factor
in choosing Belmont
over competing colleges.
You're late.
- There's a problem.
- God.
- I have never seen anything
like this before.
- Is he all right?
Is he frightened?
- I mean, we might as well be
in Mississippi, 1963.
All we need is guys with hoods
burning crosses on the quad.
- Is that a plan?
- It had to be someone
from town.
- Oh, because rural America
is racist?
- Because it couldn't
be someone from here?
- What do we do?
- President Garvey is speaking
in Boston.
I can't call him
for another hour,
so it gives us time
to come up with something.
Jeffrey, give me Rita Chambers
in the press office.
- I bet they don't do
a damn thing.
- I bet they'll expel him.
- Or her.
- We have to let people know
this isn't Belmont.
We should issues some sort
of a statement right away
condemning this.
- Well, shouldn't we try
to find out who did it first?
- They should have
an all-campus meeting,
get it out in the open.
- I bet you they call one
of those useless
all-campus meetings.
- An all-campus meeting.
That feels like the kind
of response we should have.
Doesn't it?
- Yeah.
- In case any
of the parents call.
- You could sell it
as a learning experience.
- It is a learning experience.
- And it will get everybody
on board, too,
in terms of protecting the boy.
- Like a neighborhood watch.
- We'll cancel classes
and hold the meeting
this afternoon.
- I think we should wait.
- Why don't we call it a forum?
- A forum on race.
Good idea.
- Wait, wait.
Wait a second.
We should speak to Simon first.
What if he doesn't want us
talking about him this way?
- Why wouldn't he?
- It might be embarrassing
for him.
He's very quiet.
Everybody will stare.
- No one will stare.
- Now, who's going to speak
at this forum.
- You should, Catherine.
You're Dean of the College.
- I'd like to put my name in.
- You'll want
an African-American up there.
- There's the chaplain.
- Who else?
- There's Ellen Jenkins
in Economics.
Hmm.
- Uh, Dean Kenney,
One of the guys from
the police department's here,
wants to talk to you.
- The police?
You called the police?
- Yeah.
- I told him to.
- Never do that.
It'll be in the local press,
and then the wire services
will get hold of it,
and then we're
everybody's business.
How can you be so stupid?
- Those notes are violent.
- It is an internal incident.
Internal.
You have really overstepped
your bounds this time, Sarah.
- Officer Olson wants--
- Tell him to wait.
I better not see any press
on this campus.
- Hey.
You did the right thing
calling the police.
- You couldn't have said
that back there?
- You still have the spark
of life left in you.
Just give it a couple of years
and you too will join the ranks
of the walking dead.
Is that a reporter?
Oh.
- No.
He just plays one on TV.
- I don't know.
I think the whole campus
is in shock, you know.
- Mm-hmm.
Are you in shock?
- Well, yeah.
Yeah, but I'm more curious,
you know,
because historically speaking,
The Story of Little Black Sambo
was a metaphor
for imperialism
in East India, you know.
So I'm wondering,
well, when did Sambo come
to mean, um...
oh, um, you know, I...
- Sambo.
- Sambo.
Yeah, Sambo.
- Okay, can we please stop
saying "Sambo."
- Excuse me.
Hi.
Can I help you?
- I don't know.
Who are you?
- I'm Sarah Daniels.
I'm the Dean of Students.
Who are you?
- Aaron Carmichael.
Didn't--
I used to watch you
in Chicago, didn't I?
Action News Team Channel 3
was my first job.
- That's right.
So what are you now,
with CNN?
- I'm with Channel 6
in Burlington.
- Channel 6 in Burlington.
Wow.
Good for you.
- Hmm.
- Uh, so...
are you interviewing these guys?
- Well, I'm here to do a story
on what happened
on campus last night.
The station got
an anonymous call this morning.
- Can I talk to you
for a second?
- Absolutely.
- You guys can go back
to class.
- All right.
- I wonder if you might
hold off on this thing.
The student
to whom this happened
really doesn't want
any attention.
- Oh, I'd never reveal
his name,
but this is quite a story.
A hate crime in Belmont College,
bastion of liberal idealism,
it's ready-made.
- Ready-made for what?
- So how is the college
responding to this incident?
- We're having a...
Um...
A race forum.
- And what's that?
- A forum...
on race
so we can discuss
the incident
and the surrounding issues
of race.
- Hmm.
So the usual lip service?
- Uh, no comment.
- Off the record.
- Off the record?
- Mm-hmm.
- I don't want to lose my job.
- Well, take my card then.
You'll want to talk to me
when those other vultures
descend.
So what'd you do in Chicago?
- I was Dean of Students
at Lancaster College.
- At Lancaster?
How long have you been here?
- I'm just starting
my second year.
- Well, it's, uh...
it's definitely a step up.
- Let's just say
it's different.
It's night and day.
- Belmont will not be reduced
to this trash.
Ours is a noble tradition
of learning, of truth,
most importantly,
of tolerance.
Armed with that tradition,
Belmont
will rise to this challenge.
Armed with that tradition,
she will prevail.
Now, we often speak
of the student body,
and I've always responded
to that expression,
"for this college is nothing
without all of you."
If Belmont has a heart,
it is her students.
And today Belmont's heart
beats stronger than ever.
- I thought Ellen Jenkins
was going to be up here.
- She declined our invitation.
- Oh?
- So did Simon Brick.
- Thank you, President Garvey,
for that generous introduction
and for your sterling leadership
during these trying times.
Like all of you,
I am shocked
by what has happened
to one of our students.
If truth be told,
we are a family,
and so we must ask ourselves
some difficult questions.
Have we done our best
to protect our brothers
and sisters?
Or has our silence
made us culpable?
We need to look inside
our hearts this afternoon
and ask the question,
is my conscience clear?
- And now Chaplain Scott
will close
with a nondenominational
statement
of universal spirituality.
Chaplain.
- Thank you.
We used to call it a prayer.
If we might have a moment
of silence.
May the spirit of acceptance
touch each of you,
and may our wishes
for peace be granted.
- You're not staying
for the end.
- Oh.
I always skip the credits.
- Well, President Garvey
authorized overtime
for one guard
outside Houtman Hall.
- One guard?
But there must be four
or five entrances.
- I've worked here 20 years,
Sarah,
and one thing I've learned,
these people
don't know their ass
from a hole in the ground.
- Uh.
Thanks.
- Yeah.
- Is he saying
that I'm somehow responsible
for what happened to Simon,
I mean,
just because I'm white?
- At least he talked to you.
I'm the invisible man.
- I thought we'd get to talk.
- That was
just apologist bullshit.
- Well, problem solved.
- And what's the college doing
to diversify?
- I know that they're
recruiting heavily
and they've built
these affinity houses.
- Yeah, what's that?
- Residences
for different groups,
like if all
the Pan-Asian students wanted
to live together,
explore their culture,
cook pad thai, wear sarongs.
- Yeah, but...
- if you didn't know
what they were going for,
you might call it segregation.
- Uh, Ellen.
- Dr. Jenkins.
It's good to see you.
I don't believe I've ever met
your husband.
- He's not my husband.
- I'm not her husband.
- Oh.
Oh, my mistake.
- I'm not married.
- Have we met?
- Aaron Carmichael
from Channel 6 in Burlington.
- A reporter.
Were you here today?
- I was.
- Did someone invite you?
- Actually, Dean Daniels
mentioned it to me.
- Sarah,
Join us.
- Thank you for your time.
- My pleasure.
- You know this gentlemen?
- Well, we met this morning.
In fact, Dean Daniels
was doing her level best
to kick me off campus,
all the while remaining
unfailingly polite.
- Well, in the future,
we would appreciate it
if you arranged all interviews
through our press office.
- I'll keep that in mind.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Thanks.
- I told you this would happen.
- So racism is a bad thing?
- Indeed.
- Huh.
- And behold,
they heave their collective sigh
of white guilt,
and then they drive downtown
in their Saabs and buy sweaters.
Cheryl's making up some pasta
if you want to come over.
- Don't you two ever want
to be alone?
- No.
- Hmm.
Well, I feel like I should be
paying you rent.
- You need to get out more.
- Where to?
I...
I'll see you in the morning.
- Dean Daniels.
Dean Daniels.
This is lucky.
I was gonna come by your office.
I'm Greg...
Sullivan.
- Greg.
- Well, no need to stop.
- Oh, okay.
- I just, uh, wanted to talk
to you about last week's forum.
I thought it
was really instructive.
- Oh.
I'm glad you thought so.
- Yeah,
it got me so worked up
to talk
about this Simon Brick issue.
Everybody else too.
- Uh-huh.
- But, uh, I feel like
the momentum's dying out,
so I had an idea.
I want
to start a discussion group...
- Oh?
- To keep people talking.
- Oh.
- I was thinking
about calling it
Students for Tolerance.
- Oh.
- What do you think?
- It, uh...
it's a good idea, actually.
- Excellent.
Uh, so how does
something like that get
to be official?
- Uh...
does it have to be official?
- Yeah, just to get a room.
- Okay.
Uh...
well, uh, first you need
a faculty sponsor,
and then, um,
the Student Activities Committee
gives you an account
and a space.
- And at that point,
could I say
that I'm the founder
and president
of Students for Tolerance.
- Uh.
I don't see why not.
- I'm applying
for law school next year,
and I'm a little short
on the extracurricular,
if you know what I mean.
- I see.
Hey, uh...
why don't you ask Dean Strauss
to be your sponsor?
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah, I thought
you might like it.
- Thanks,
Dean Daniels,
and, uh, nice pace.
Ah, whatever.
- Dean Kenney,
how are you?
- Not well.
- Dean Daniels,
I'm Mike Olsen,
Belmont police.
- Oh, how do you do?
- Pleasure.
- Where's Simon?
- In my room.
- Oh.
- It must have happened
while we were at breakfast.
- The guard was probably
on the other side
of the building.
- Here's the rock.
- Very helpful.
- Excuse me.
- You know, uh,
cameras would solve
this whole problem
inside and out.
- Why not razor wire
and guard towers?
- Catherine.
- We are already
in the Boston papers.
Are you aware of that?
"Racial Incident at Belmont."
"Racists Run Belmont Ragged."
And that reporter friend
of yours wants
to bring a camera crew
to the next forum.
- Well, what's the point
of another forum?
- How else are we going
to have a dialogue?
- Well, we could talk
to each other
instead of being talked at.
Public dialogue
is never real dialogue.
Nobody will admit
to anything in a crowd.
- Well, that reporter's
gonna be there,
so I can only hope you're right.
- I told Simon we can
just switch rooms for a while.
- Why don't you take him up
on it?
- My dad's always told me
that we can afford
to do what we want,
but if you want to live
in that neighborhood
or go to that school,
you have to be prepared
for ugliness,
and you can't let it bother you.
So if I go home
or change rooms even,
I'm letting it bother me.
- you're letting them win.
- but I want to win.
- well, I think it's coming
along just fine.
More details, okay?
That's it.
More--oh, excuse me.
Sarah.
- Burton.
- a young man, Greg Sullivan,
has asked me
To sponsor his students
for tolerance group.
He said you recommended me.
- Well, you seemed
like an obvious choice to me.
- We'd be honored
if Simon Brick would attend
our first meeting,
but he won't return any
of my calls.
- I doubt he wants to come.
- Would you ask him?
- I'd rather not.
- But you're our liaison.
- What?
- To the minority students.
- Wha--what the hell does
that mean?
- Never mind.
I'll keep trying him myself.
- My dad said I should insist
on talking to you right away.
When I got the scholarship,
they took away my financial aid.
It's costing more now.
- That's not right.
- My dad is furious.
He was already mad
about the whole hispanic thing.
He said I shouldn't have to make
compromises to get something.
- Maybe I should call him
and try to explain.
- And then I told him
about Simon Brick,
and he completely freaked.
He said that's exactly why
he didn't want me to come here.
- He didn't want you
to come here?
- But I wanted a change
of scenery,
you know,
or just some scenery, period.
But now with this financial aid
letter, I--
- Don't worry, okay?
I will straighten this out.
What?
Is there something else?
- Some of my friends asked me
to come here and talk to you
about that forum thing we had
to go to.
We felt like it
was really insulting.
- You mean
the minority students?
- No, I mean--
What?
You think all my friends
are minority students?
- No, I just--I just thought
that's what you meant.
- Why?
Because hispanic people
stick together?
- No, I just--
I didn't--
I wasn't thinking, like,
you and your amigos or anything.
That was a joke.
I was making a joke.
- It wasn't funny.
- My god, Patrick.
I'm sorry.
- And I didn't correct
you before,
but it's "students of color,"
not "minority students."
Students of color.
Of course.
I just--the minority thing,
you know,
it's--it's a--
it's a technical thing.
You know paperwork:
Everything has to fit
into a box.
- Is that why you made me say
I was Puerto Rican?
- You know, Patrick,
I wasn't trying
to make you say anything.
I just wanted to make sure
you got the scholarship.
- So it was a compromise.
- No,
not a bad compromise
like your dad meant,
but a good compromise,
between the two of us,
that you agreed to.
- Right.
- Look, Patrick.
I really am on your side.
Everyone who recommended you
says you are
an exceptional student,
smart, and talented.
So just let us give you
the $12,000, okay?
- Okay.
- And don't be shy.
You go to the next forum,
and you tell them how you feel.
- We must rebuild
our community,
and to do that,
we must rebuild our sense
of trust.
I know we can
count on all of you
to help us in this effort.
The safety of our students
is a paramount concern
to all of us here today.
And you have our word:
The miscreant responsible
for this second heinous act
will be discovered.
- Miscreant?
- Heinous.
- And now I believe
Dean Strauss has a few words.
- Thank you, President Garvey.
I'd like to begin this afternoon
with a story that--
Is there a question?
- We wanted to say something.
At the forum last time
when you talked,
we found it really patronizing.
- Be sure you get this.
- We felt like you talked
about the students of color
like we weren't even here,
and then you talked
about the white students
like they were all a bunch
of criminals.
- You must have misunderstood.
- But how can we misunderstand?
There's a bunch
of white people
onstage
literally talking down to us.
Young lady, I want to--
I want to hear what you have
to say, but...
- Here we go.
- I can understand
your feelings.
We're all brothers
and sisters here.
- Here we go where?
- I-I would like to begin.
I had a story.
- Hey, man.
You're not our brothers.
- You people don't know
what you're talking about.
When I say "brother,"
I mean "brother."
I was a freedom rider.
I marched on Selma.
- Ancient history.
- Yeah, you weren't at the back
of the line.
- You weren't there.
I sacrificed for you people.
- Burton.
Enough.
Let him talk.
- What are you talking about?
Sit down.
- Please, can we all
just sit down?
- But you're always telling us,
"be inclusive."
- It's sheer tokenism, Jay.
- You only want us here
so you can put our pictures
on your fucking website!
That's right.
- All you care about
is your image.
- Shut up!
- Listen.
Listen! Listen!
I got this scholarship.
It was supposed
to go to a minority student,
but then I'm not
an official minority
because there's no box
on the form for what I am.
So to get the scholarship,
I had to say I was Puerto Rican.
But I've never even been
to Puerto Rico.
- Excuse me!
Excuse me!
What are you complaining about?
I don't even get a scholarship
because I'm white.
- I didn't get it for my color.
- That's what you just said!
- I deserved
that scholarship.
- I don't get shit
for being white.
I'm living in freshmen dorms
'cause there's not
enough housing
because of those
dumbass affinity houses.
- We like those affinity houses
because they get us away
from you.
- Come on.
Half of 'em are empty!
- 'Cause we don't want
to be ghetto-ized.
- Why not?
It's where you belong.
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!
- Oh, don't.
- This is not
what we marched for.
- Give us some help here.
- Security.
Find security.
Turn that camera off.
You! Turn that off!
Turn it off!
- So what's the purpose
of these forums
that you're holding?
- Well, we believe
the forums offer
a valuable learning experience
and also a chance to heal.
- But there was little
in the way of healing
at this afternoon's forum.
- You! Turn that off!
Turn it off!
- Some students blame
remarks made
by the faculty at today's forum
for the violence that ensued.
Belmont's press office reported
that five students were treated
for minor injuries.
This is Aaron Carmichael
reporting live
from Belmont College.
- Sarah.
Would you excuse us?
- Can I buy you a drink?
- I'm not giving you
an interview.
- I'm off the clock.
I've only been here two months,
and I could really use
the company.
- Only if we go someplace
where there aren't any students.
Oh, man.
We're gonna get killed.
- Oh, I can handle myself.
I'm from Newark.
- What can I get ya?
What a letdown.
- Uh...
- I'll have a beer.
Two beers.
- Two beers.
- Okay.
- So how did you end up...
- In Burlington?
- See.
See, I knew that was coming.
Um...
I was at WKOW in Portland,
then KCTV Kansas City
doing features,
trying to get
behind the anchors' desk.
But every station
had black anchors already.
Then this producer
in Burlington called,
and I thought, "hmm."
- There are no blacks
in Vermont.
- I want East Coast exposure.
I want to move
to a major network.
- And a story like this
is ready-made?
- It wasn't my idea
to cover this.
I learned a long time ago
that my subjects better not be
too black too often.
- So why are you doing it?
I didn't really decide to
until I got on campus.
It seemed that everybody
was working so hard
to get me off campus
that I had to wonder,
who exactly are they trying
to protect?
- Simon.
- Well, you are maybe.
I don't know about the rest
of them.
Do--I can't take this music.
- Oh.
Do you got some coins
for the jukebox?
- # higher #
# 'cause your love, love, love #
# it takes me higher #
- Air supply?
- Please.
- How do you know
you're a good reporter?
- I am a good reporter.
- But how do you know
if you don't get hired
because you're black,
or if you do get hired
because you're black?
- Didn't Lancaster hire you
because you're white?
- They needed
a last-minute replacement.
- Oh, I thought it was
because of some quota.
- It was because I was cheap.
You're not siding
with that little twerp
at the forum,
are you,
Mr. Reverse Discrimination
Anti-Affirmative Action?
- It's just the other student,
the one with the scholarship.
- Okay.
Here we go.
- You want to dance?
So he changed "New York"
to "Puerto" and got $12,000.
What's the problem?
- People should be called
what they want to be called.
- Yeah, but how are you
supposed to keep up?
- That's not the point.
When--when I was at Lancaster,
even though it was my job
to help the students,
sometimes,
because I was white,
people took my advice
as paternalistic.
- Like you were
the missionary lady
coming to clean up the natives.
- Well,
something like that.
- Or the kindly slave owner
come to help out these darkies.
- Just...
- Okay.
- Quit it!
So with Patrick,
I thought...
I will treat him entirely
as an equal.
We will be in
on this whole thing together,
exploit the system,
put it to the man.
- Yeah, but you're the man.
- He wasn't in on anything.
I was just--
I was just a crazy Dean
forcing him to be Puerto Rican.
- Well, did you make him wear
a sombrero?
- That's Mexican.
- You know, I don't even know
why you want to help these kids.
They seem like a bunch
of ingrates to me.
- Because the world isn't fair.
People keep getting their asses
handed to them.
Why shouldn't we try
and change that?
Ah.
You're an idealist.
Shut up, idealist,
and dance.
- You still want
to go to the game tomorrow?
- Oh, yeah.
I'd love to.
- All right.
Get him.
Oh!
- Son of a bitch.
- Oh, ho-ho.
- What?
Uh...
Oh, my God.
- Thanks for the beer.
You're sending me on my way.
- Tonight was pretty much
the best time
that I've had in Vermont.
- It's been so long since
I've had an actual conversation.
- I was starting to feel crazy.
But tomorrow's gonna be
a horrible day,
and I have to get some sleep.
- If you don't like it here,
why did you come?
- What, are you
investigating me now?
- You don't fit in here.
The--these people are...
blowholes.
I believe the expression
is "blowhards."
- What are you doing here?
- Well, what are you
doing here?
- What, are you saying
that I couldn't cut it
anywhere else?
- Are you saying I sold out?
- You ought
to hide those buttons
so they don't get pushed.
- You ought
to hide those chains
so they don't get yanked.
- I'm not--
I didn't--
- Yeah, before you choke
on that foot...
you want to have lunch tomorrow?
- Oh, hey.
What's up, b?
- aight.
- All right, Del.
- For the career day coming up,
I have some ideas for people
that I would like to invite.
Practically speaking, I'm--
- I told you, man.
- So, I would like to pursue--
- Hey, man,
you disturbing class.
- Sit down, man.
- pursue any ideas that...
that you all might have.
- Come on, nigger, sit down.
- Take your seats, please.
Hey, guys.
- Will President Garvey
make a statement?
- No comment.
- Will President Garvey
make a statement?
- No comment.
Please. Please.
He'll have a statement
later this morning.
- Does the board
have any official position?
- I believe
I've already answered that.
- Are you still holding
classes?
- Of course.
- Over here.
One more question.
- Please. Please.
If everybody could just wait,
I'll be handing out
a press release shortly.
- Will President Garvey resign?
- No, he won't.
- Are the minority students
going on strike?
- Not to my knowledge.
- Will President Garvey
be making a statement?
- Please. Please.
Sarah.
Those are the names and numbers
of some of our key
African-American alumni.
President Garvey wants you
to call them
and assure them that everything
is under control.
- Why me?
I mean...
Burton said this thing
to me the other day
about my being the liaison
to the minority students.
- Well, when we set out
to diversify,
we wanted your experience
serving a...
more diverse student population.
- It wasn't diverse.
- African-American then.
- Why didn't you hire
a black person?
- We tried.
- So when I came here
for my interview,
were you surprised?
- Surprised?
- Because I was white?
- No.
- You didn't think
that because I was at Lancaster,
I was black.
- By the time we hired you,
we knew you were white,
so don't let it bother you.
You deserved that scholarship,
and you know it.
- Then why does it have to come
at a price?
Why is there is always
some fucking price?
Look.
Here's why I agreed
to come and talk to you.
I'm applying
at NYU for the spring.
I'm not staying here.
- Patrick.
- I hate this place.
You could give me $12,000,
and I don't care.
It's not worth it.
My father says
if I stay here,
all I'll learn is shame.
- That's not all you'll learn.
- I hate Vermont.
- Please.
Please reconsider.
You're so smart.
- I don't want to reconsider,
and I don't want
anymore compliments!
I'm not some genius
or something.
I'm just whatever I am,
and I want to get the fuck out
of here!
- Patrick.
- You're early.
- Do you want to take a walk?
- Well, I don't think
it's entirely your fault.
- It's not enough
to say my intentions were good.
I made the kid feel like shit.
- So?
Learn from your mistakes.
Make up for it
with the next one.
- That's what I was trying
to do with Patrick.
- Yeah,
what were you making up for?
- There was no money
at Lancaster.
I couldn't do anything
for anybody there.
- Is that why you left?
- I left to come here.
- Because...
See, see, see.
I just keep getting
this look away.
Look, is there something
with the college
that you're not
coming clean about?
Because I already know
that they basically went out
and trolled for black students.
- It's called recruiting.
They're trying to diversify.
- Which you're all for, right?
- It's...
It's just...
it's just that the college
treats these kids
like they're action figures,
you know,
like you can collect
the whole set,
but then if you want
to play with them,
you have to take them out
of their packaging.
And once you do that,
they're no good anymore.
- Look.
If you think
the world isn't fair
and you want to change that,
shouldn't you be
at Lancaster?
Shouldn't your try and help
the kids who actually need it?
- You don't understand.
Something happened to me.
- At Lancaster?
What happened to you there?
- I can't.
- Sarah.
Sarah!
As police continue
to search for the guilty party,
many students
at Belmont are worried
about the racial climate
at their school.
- White people talk to you
in class.
Socially, there's not a lot
of interaction.
- Well, it seems like
the students of color want
to stay separate.
I mean, they have
their own student union,
their own radio shows.
- And some students wonder
if Belmont College's attempts
to bridge the racial divide
are actually making
matters worse.
Aaron Carmichael, in Belmont,
for Channel 6 news.
- Hey, the fat lady
has not sung yet.
Let's go to the Fox Hat.
Come on.
- I...
I got to finish this paper
while I can still see.
- I'll do a shot
in your honor, dude.
- All right.
Whoo-hoo!
- Fuck. Fuck.
- Hey, you!
What are you doing here?
- Yeah,
what about the note, huh?
Did you find that too,
or did you put it
on Simon's door?
- I just found it.
I swear to you I would
never do anything like that.
I swear to God!
- Jason. Jason.
- Back the fuck off, man.
He didn't do it.
- He didn't do anything.
He was out with us.
- Where is Simon?
We're gonna move you
in here with Nathan.
- They're winning.
- Belmont College.
Nestled in the mountains
of northern Vermont,
It's the kind
of small liberal arts school
most parents would feel
perfectly safe
sending their children to...
until now.
That's when a series
of ugly racial taunts
against
an African-American student
turned into what some
are calling a death threat.
It's this sinister message,
intended for the unidentified
Belmont student,
that has led
to the heightened concern
and heightened security.
Apparently, the same student
received similar threats
in the last two weeks,
threats
that some say were mishandled
by the school administration.
Are you with me?
Are you sick of this?
Are you tired
of an Administration
that does nothing?
If President Garvey
can't provide
some sort of leadership,
then he should step aside
for somebody who can.
- Belmont's Board of Trustees
held an emergency meeting
to discuss how to deal
with the problem,
although the school
has made no public statement.
In the meantime,
minority students
are taking time off
from the college,
and many of them are leaving
for good.
- The Board is livid.
They want
the students protected,
and they want solutions.
So here's what I need you to do.
Come up with a ten-point plan.
- A plan for what?
- Call it "racial harmony."
- Seriously?
- Seriously.
And type it up
so any idiot can understand it.
Type it up in a bulleted list.
- You want me to solve racism
with a bulleted list?
- Include
specific concrete suggestions.
- You know,
I've got an exclusive
with the kids
in the Black Student Union.
I thought you might like
to listen in.
- Well, I can't.
- Well, don't you care
what they have to say?
- Of course I do,
but I'm busy.
That's not why I'm here.
I want to know
why you ran away the other day.
Do you not trust me?
- You're a reporter.
- But you're not my story.
- Well, what am I then?
- A friend.
Maybe something more.
I don't know.
Or maybe you don't date
black men.
- That's not it,
and you know it.
- Yeah?
Well, how do I know it?
- You know, I was
wondering if maybe the reason
you thought you could treat
the Patrick Chibas kid
as an equal
is because he's
a nice, creamy latte color
instead of just plain old black.
- That's ridiculous.
- You know, maybe you did look
down on those kids at Lancaster.
- I did not look down on them.
- Maybe that's why you left.
- No.
- Was it the money?
The skiing?
- I don't ski.
- The scenery?
- Why not?
It's beautiful.
- It's empty.
- There's no crime.
- Except hate crimes.
- The leaves, the snow,
the fresh air.
- It's a gated community.
- It's a winter wonderland.
- It's fucking White Christmas.
It's white.
- You said it.
- And you're not denying it.
So you wanted
to be with white people.
- I wasn't always like this,
okay.
You have to believe me.
I wasn't always like this.
- Then what changed?
- I used to be a good person.
- What changed?
- I met the students.
- At Lancaster.
- It wasn't like I'd never been
around black people before.
- But...
- But I'd only ever known
people--
people like you.
- Nice, clean, black folks.
- These kids were different.
- How?
- They were more...
regular.
And they scared the shit
out of me.
Maybe it was
because I was outnumbered,
but they all seemed so loud
and belligerent.
And I couldn't understand
a word they were saying.
They would walk down the hall
in packs
and if I didn't get out
of their way,
they'd ram me over
and pushed me aside.
- Hey, hey.
- They were kids.
- Yeah,
that's what I told myself.
"They're just kids.
Kids are kids,"
And that worked
for about a minute.
But then I just got pissed off
because they were so rude.
- All of them?
- No, there were plenty
of nice ones,
but they aren't
the ones you notice.
You notice the awful ones
because they dominate
the landscape.
And it was the same
on the train.
There would be
a dozen black people
sitting quietly,
going about their business,
but there'd be
two incredibly loud,
stinky, offensive black guys
at one end of the car,
and they'd be
the ones I noticed.
And I told myself not
to pay attention to them,
that they weren't representative
of their entire race.
I knew that.
But then I noticed
that I started slipping
into a pattern
when I got on the train.
First--first I would look
for an empty seat
next to a white woman
and then a white man
and then a black woman
and then...
Last choice, a black man.
And sometimes,
if the only empty seats
were next to black men
and if they were wearing
big puffy coats,
then I would just stand.
And then I started
adding categories:
white men,
then hispanic, then Asian,
then Middle Eastern
and then finally
and always last,
black men.
- Thanks.
- Well, I felt terrible
about it
at first.
I'd--I'd get on the train,
and--and I'd wonder,
"what must
that poor black man be thinking?
"I'm so obviously avoiding him.
"he's a perfectly nice person
sitting there.
I can see his face."
But I just...
didn't want to take a chance.
And then after a while,
it sort of slipped my mind
to feel bad about it,
and then everything
slipped my mind
so that when I found myself
sitting across from my students
thinking that they were scary
or that their hair was stupid
or it was no wonder
they were pregnant,
I knew it was wrong,
but...
I didn't care.
I just felt tired,
contemptuous.
They weren't gonna listen to me.
They weren't gonna graduate
from college.
They weren't gonna do anything
with their lives,
not because they couldn't,
but because they didn't want to,
because they were lazy
and stupid...
because they were black.
And it started to scare me.
For the career day coming up,
I have some ideas for people
that I would like to invite.
And then I think--
I think that we should
make some--
- Crazy, man.
- make some room...
- Give it.
- for employers
who are actually recruiting.
Hey, could you guys--
- Yo. Yo, man.
Do you want
to take your seats, please?
- Come on, nigger, sit down.
- Ass in the seat, Nigger.
- Chill out, girl.
- Hey, could you guys--
Do you want--
- Naw, man, naw.
- Nigger!
- Could you guys--
- Nigger, stop playing.
- Stop it!
I mean, Jesus Christ,
if you keep calling
yourself niggers
and acting like niggers,
then why do you get so upset
when we think you're niggers?
- You said that to them?
- This close.
It was leaving my mouth.
I could see it in the air.
- Well, it's not
my favorite word either.
- But I can't say that.
- No.
No, no. No, no.
- I knew
that if I didn't leave
that that crap would start
coming out of my mouth,
that everything
that popped into my head,
that I would say it.
Belmont, Vermont.
Beautiful mountain.
Green mountain.
I knew it would be quiet
and clean...
and white.
It wasn't a noble way
to save myself, or a brave way,
but it was the only way
I could think of.
But now I'm right back
where I started.
- But you're not a dog.
- Of course I'm not.
- So you can control this crap,
but, you know,
you act like you can't,
like a dog can't help chewing up
the furniture.
But you're not a dog.
You're a human
with a human-sized brain.
- Well, what about you?
You're not perfect.
"Put a sombrero on him."
- We could do this all day.
You know,
just get it all out.
Come on.
Yeah?
"Blacks:
"Lazy.
"Stupid.
Scary hair."
- They're always late.
- Come on. Come on.
- Homeless.
They never use crosswalks.
They're always running out
into traffic.
- Well, it's no wonder
they're all dead or in prison.
- Okay.
Now...
"Whites:
"Stingy.
Tight-assed."
- Spineless.
- They can know you
for 15 years
and walk right by you
on the street
without even recognizing you.
Always stealing our talent
and our music.
- Plain vanilla candy-asses.
- Can't cook for shit.
No sex drive.
- Frigid.
- And when they do it,
they do it all wrong.
- Hey.
- Freak-assed serial killers.
- Hateful.
Liars.
- And they're always asking
black people to tell them
that it's okay
that they are racist.
But that's just trading insults.
- Yeah.
What we need is a plan.
- Hell yes,
we need a plan.
I mean,
what are you gonna do,
just sit there and wallow in it?
What the hell good is
that going to do you?
- Well, fine.
What's yours?
- I'm going to get
to the bottom of this story.
I'm gonna find the truth,
because I'll bet
whoever's doing this,
they don't stand out at all.
But I'm gonna find
the son of a bitch
and put his face on national TV.
I'm gonna say,
"Here you are, America.
"Huh?
Remind you of somebody?
Run away from that."
- Oh, I already ran away.
It doesn't work.
- So what's your plan?
- "One: Stop being stupid.
"Two: Move to Vermont.
Three: Admit defeat."
What is this?
- The college wants a plan too,
ten steps to solve racism.
And they asked you.
- Apparently,
I put on a good face.
- Well,
that's half the battle.
- # it's my turn, my turn #
# let's go, let's go #
# I put it all on the line #
# when I'm out on the crime #
# it's my turn, my turn #
# let's go, let's go #
# if you really want it,
go and get it #
# don't let it go #
# it's my turn, my turn #
# let's go, let's go #
# I put it all on the line #
# when I'm out on the crime #
- Hey!
- # if you want it,
go and get it #
# don't let it go #
# you can kill 15 cats
in one song #
# and you wonder why your shows
don't last that long #
- You can't record this.
- Yeah,
well, you can't keep it secret.
- He's back there.
- Did you call the police?
- No.
He said it'd be okay
if we called you.
- It was all you?
- I can see my hands
writing those notes
and tying that rope.
I knew I would get caught.
I just...
I did it anyway.
- Why?
- It's like someone else
was doing it.
- Well, I wish somebody else
was doing it.
Now they're gonna think
we're all crazy.
- Oh, they're gonna love this.
"There's no racism.
They're doing it to themselves."
The press is gonna be
all over this.
Do you know that brothers
are being executed for nothing?
For nothing!
It's shit like this
that sets us back every time.
I can't believe I've got to go
on the air and report this.
This is an embarrassment!
- It's not about you.
- Well, it sure
as hell isn't about you.
- What are you gonna do?
- You?
- Good luck to you then, Sarah.
- Good luck to you.
- Write up a press release.
Don't say "expelled."
- I'll say he
voluntarily agreed to leave.
- Mm-hmm.
And say we've encouraged him
to seek counseling.
- Say he's deranged.
- You've never even spoken
to him.
- Highlight the fact
that we are forming a committee
and we're looking forward
to further discussion.
And you fill in the rest.
- I'll get it out this morning.
- You know, I feel sorry
for Simon.
I feel like it's going
to take him a long time
to recover from this.
- I think
he just wanted attention.
- None of you know Simon.
- I do.
He's Little Black Sambo.
That's how he referred
to himself in the notes.
Remember the story?
Little Black Sambo
has some beautiful new clothes,
and he's walking
through the jungle
showing them off,
and a tiger jumps out
of the bush
and threatens to eat him.
So Little Black Sambo
offers his coat
to the tiger
in exchange for his life.
And then another tiger pops up,
and so on and so on,
until the tigers have taken
all his clothes.
Little Black Sambo is going home
naked and forlorn
when he hears a terrible noise
coming from the forest.
All of the tigers
are wearing his clothes
And arguing over
which of them
is the grandest tiger of all.
The tigers argued and argued
until they got so angry,
they started chasing each other
around a tree.
They began spinning and spinning
Until they were
just a yellow blur.
They spun so fast,
they spun themselves
into butter.
So Little Black Sambo
got himself a spoon,
scooped up the butter,
and ate the tigers up,
which is just what Simon Brick
has done to us,
gotten us all in a whirl
over nothing.
- It wasn't over nothing.
- He's a little fox,
a con man.
- Imagine him
for half a second.
- Oh, ho.
- That isn't why he did it.
- Why then?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
- Come in.
- I got a call you wanted
to see Simon
before I drive him home.
- Yes, we do.
- Oh, please don't.
- We deserve an opportunity
to confront the individual
who's put us through all this.
Bring him in here, Mr. Meyers.
Well,
don't you have anything
to say for yourself,
Mr. Brick?
What were you trying
to get out of us?
- Nigger.
I was waiting for someone
to call me a nigger.
- You see, all my life,
my dad told me,
"be ready.
Be ready for the day.
Be ready."
But no one would do it.
- Because no one
on this campus thinks that.
- Yeah.
Everyone on this campus
is real nice to me.
I mean, I walk into a room,
and you all smile big smiles.
And I can see
you're all trying really hard
to think of something
to say to me,
going out of your way
to be my friend,
like my R.A.
He's great.
You know he has dinner
with me every night?
I can't even walk down
the sidewalk
because every one
of my professors
has to come up to me
and say hello.
They walk right past
all their white students,
but they all say hello to me.
Yeah, I'm--
I'm lucky
the way everyone loves me.
- You are lucky.
- You think I can't feel
that hate?
It's so thick
that I can't even breathe!
Why don't you just say it?
Say it!
- Get him out of here.
- Come on, Simon, let's go.
- Say it!
- Get him out of here.
Get him off my campus now.
- I hate you too.
- Let's go.
- And on that note...
- What's this?
- My letter of resignation.
I quit.
- Why?
- This sends
a terrible message.
- He's right.
He's nothing but a problem
to you.
- Of his own making.
- You're relieved he's gone.
You'd be relieved
if they all left.
- That's outrageous.
- Oh, there's no cameras now.
Just say it.
"We'd all be so much happier.
It'd be so much easier
if everybody was white."
- I have never thought that.
- Fine.
Stick to your stories
if it makes you feel better,
but...
I don't want
to be a liar anymore,
and I really want
to get the fuck out of here.
- Where are you going?
- Hey, jared.
Wait up.
- Oh, thanks.
- There it is.
Come here.
Congratulations.
Send me a postcard
from the land of the living.
- All right.
Bye.
- Dean Daniels.
Greg Sullivan,
Students for Tolerance.
- Oh, yeah,
I remember you, Greg.
What's up?
- Our first meeting was a bust.
Dean Strauss wouldn't shut up.
- And on top of that,
there are no black students
in our group.
- Aha.
- Right.
It's ridiculous.
But I don't know what to do.
- Well, maybe I do.
- Hi, Dean Daniels.
- Hey,
Claudia, Tyler.
I've got someone here
I'd like you to meet.
- I think Aaron's point
that we cover these stories
more aggressively
is probably true,
but they also seem un--
unusually common.
- But it's fair to speculate
on what motivates these people.
Belmont is implying
that this particular student
is mentally ill.
- Well,
of course you have to be
to do something like this.
But it happens often enough
that it makes you wonder
if there's not
something else too.
- Something in the air?
- Well, maybe.
I mean, this kid wouldn't have
done this to himself
if somebody hadn't made him
feel bad,
if somebody hadn't put the words
in his head.
See, I don't think
you see yourself like that,
the way he did,
unless somebody's already seen
you that way first.
Let me explain.
