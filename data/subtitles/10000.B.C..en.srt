2
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,678
Only time can teach us what
is truth and what is legend.

3
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:26,618
Some truths do not survive the ages.

4
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:32,399
But the legend of the child with
the blue eyes will live forever

5
00:01:32,699 --> 00:01:36,039
and be whispered in all four
winds of the great white mountains.

6
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:40,637
We, the Yagahl, were hunters
of the mightiest of all beasts,

7
00:01:41,002 --> 00:01:45,155
the manak. But our world began to change.

8
00:01:45,467 --> 00:01:48,943
The manaks came later
and later to our valley

9
00:01:48,991 --> 00:01:51,993
and there were times when
they did not come at all.

10
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:54,409
Our hunters grew restless,

11
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,937
and our people grew hungry.

12
00:02:00,894 --> 00:02:04,903
Only one amongst us, the
one we called Old Mother,

13
00:02:05,086 --> 00:02:09,724
the last of her kind, only she could
speak to the spirits of the earth

14
00:02:10,801 --> 00:02:16,184
and ask the wisdom of the
Fathers to save our people.

15
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:22,390
Many times she asked.

16
00:02:22,491 --> 00:02:27,623
Until one night, they answered
her call and sent us a sign.

17
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:35,038
A sign of the beginning of the end.

18
00:02:36,363 --> 00:02:40,062
We found her in the mountains.
She was holding onto a dead woman.

19
00:03:08,122 --> 00:03:10,639
The Fathers have sent her.

20
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,142
She came to tell us

21
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:36,919
of four-legged demons that
will put an end to our world.

22
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:45,207
They will come to our
valley at the time when

23
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:48,412
we go on our last hunt.

24
00:03:49,962 --> 00:03:52,576
But do not fear.

25
00:03:53,863 --> 00:03:58,715
From this hunt, a warrior will arise.

26
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:02,539
And this one will be his woman.

27
00:04:02,917 --> 00:04:06,112
They will lead us into a new life

28
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:11,834
where the Yagahl will
know hunger no more.

29
00:04:14,633 --> 00:04:19,978
That night, Old Mother did not see
the face of the warrior which spoke,

30
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:24,065
but she knew that the
child with the blue eyes

31
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:28,083
was a blessing that she must protect.

32
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:32,953
To our people, she was Evolet,
the promise of life.

33
00:04:33,243 --> 00:04:38,802
To a boy named D'Leh,
she was much more than that.

34
00:04:51,379 --> 00:04:56,065
Only one of the Yagahl did not
believe in Old Mother's prophecy:

35
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,003
The young boy's father,

36
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:04,190
the one who carried the White Spear
and blew the whistle for the hunt.

37
00:05:05,457 --> 00:05:08,556
I will watch over your
son as if he were my own.

38
00:05:10,231 --> 00:05:11,524
I know you will.

39
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:15,324
But promise me you will
tell no one why I left.

40
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,293
We cannot wait for the last hunt.

41
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:38,591
Throw again! Good throw!

42
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,383
Ka'Ren.

43
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:42,474
Ka'Ren.

44
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:45,515
No, not you.

45
00:05:46,309 --> 00:05:49,078
Your father abandoned our people.
Go away.

46
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:58,383
Leave him!
Ka'Ren, I said, leave him!

47
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,599
- D'Leh...
- He's the son of a coward.

48
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:07,088
You never say that again.

49
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:09,992
Any of you.

50
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,804
You are alone. Like me.

51
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:36,853
What happened to your people?

52
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:38,993
They were killed.

53
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,907
By four-legged demons.

54
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:55,240
You will never be alone, Evolet.

55
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:04,797
Do you see that light?
That one?

56
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:08,873
It does not move across the
sky like all the others do.

57
00:07:10,994 --> 00:07:13,143
That light is like you, in my heart.

58
00:07:13,773 --> 00:07:15,632
It will never go away.

59
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:17,975
It will never go away?

60
00:07:18,265 --> 00:07:19,853
No. Never.

61
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:24,950
Evolet, come here.

62
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:28,132
Don't stray from the
hut without telling me.

63
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:37,554
And for many moons Evolet and
D'Leh looked at each other,

64
00:07:37,844 --> 00:07:42,424
and the love in their
hearts grew stronger.

65
00:07:49,676 --> 00:07:54,227
Until finally, after many years,

66
00:07:54,262 --> 00:07:58,778
the day of the last hunt arrived.

67
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:02,467
D'Leh, how long do we
have to keep watching?

68
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:04,346
Until the manaks come.

69
00:08:06,824 --> 00:08:09,168
- And when will they come?
- I don't know.

70
00:08:10,378 --> 00:08:14,251
- D'Leh, when will I become a hunter?
- When you stop asking so many questions.

71
00:08:20,903 --> 00:08:24,351
Great hunter Tic'Tic
came to Old Mother's hut.

72
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:27,168
She thinks the time of prophecy has come.

73
00:08:27,203 --> 00:08:29,608
She told him not to
kill the manak this hunt.

74
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,949
She thinks Ka'Ren
will win the White Spear

75
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:35,310
and claim Evolet.

76
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:41,180
Baku, look what I found for you.

77
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,836
You know what a good hunter Ka'Ren is.

78
00:08:46,397 --> 00:08:47,430
We must run away.

79
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:49,981
Together we can cross
the Great Mountains.

80
00:08:50,016 --> 00:08:53,398
Abandon our people?
Like my father?

81
00:08:53,433 --> 00:08:56,149
I cannot do that.

82
00:08:58,115 --> 00:09:01,009
I've waited for this so many moons.

83
00:09:02,936 --> 00:09:05,191
The only way to be together is,

84
00:09:05,705 --> 00:09:08,194
I must kill the manak.

85
00:09:19,358 --> 00:09:21,498
They are here! They are here!
Look!

86
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,839
Look how many they are!

87
00:09:55,908 --> 00:10:00,276
Today, I will not pierce
the heart of the manak.

88
00:10:00,556 --> 00:10:02,371
It will be one of you.

89
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:05,582
One of you will claim the White Spear.

90
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:10,784
May the Fathers of the Yagahr
and the spirit of the mighty manak

91
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:12,217
choose the best of you.

92
00:10:15,733 --> 00:10:19,091
- Ka'Ren, you have the first throw.
- Ka'Ren, the manak is yours.

93
00:10:19,126 --> 00:10:20,057
You will be our leader.

94
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:26,031
D'Leh, what about you?

95
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:30,418
I want to win Evolet.

96
00:10:32,929 --> 00:10:35,967
All together, at once!

97
00:11:08,074 --> 00:11:11,318
Tic'Tic found the lead bull.

98
00:12:02,947 --> 00:12:06,326
Slow down! D'Leh!

99
00:12:12,705 --> 00:12:16,116
They're breaking away!
Hold him back!

100
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:42,238
Baku, they are coming!

101
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,755
They are coming! They are coming!

102
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:47,673
They are...

103
00:12:59,425 --> 00:13:02,699
The last one is coming!
It is a big bull!

104
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:30,258
D'Leh is coming!
Ka'Ren, make your throw!

105
00:13:38,758 --> 00:13:41,556
Keep him low!
Hold him back!

106
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:55,886
He's too strong.
Let go, Ka'Ren.

107
00:13:56,633 --> 00:14:01,097
- D'Leh, we have to let go.
- I can't. My hand is caught.

108
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:33,189
Look, look!
It's D'Leh!

109
00:15:41,168 --> 00:15:43,356
You killed him!
All alone!

110
00:15:43,391 --> 00:15:45,544
No one has ever done that.

111
00:15:47,316 --> 00:15:50,152
That was brave.

112
00:15:53,164 --> 00:15:56,204
D'Leh killed the manak.
He did not let go of the net.

113
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,696
He was the only one.

114
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,447
What are you waiting for?

115
00:16:04,715 --> 00:16:07,469
Wise Spirit, I killed the manak.

116
00:16:07,504 --> 00:16:14,883
I claim the White Spear.
And with it my woman.

117
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:29,533
From that day on,
D'Leh was no longer the son of a coward.

118
00:16:29,842 --> 00:16:33,836
Now the Yagahl would honor his name

119
00:16:33,871 --> 00:16:39,670
for bringing to them the blessings
of the manak for one last time.

120
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:44,261
And though Old Mother
was pleased in her heart

121
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:47,310
to see Evolet so happy,

122
00:16:47,348 --> 00:16:51,861
she feared in her soul that the
one who had slain the mighty beast

123
00:16:51,896 --> 00:16:56,528
did not have the courage
for what was to come.

124
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,374
Why does Tic'Tic not celebrate with us?

125
00:17:15,496 --> 00:17:17,986
- D'Leh?
- There's something I must do.

126
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:35,772
What do you want?

127
00:17:41,331 --> 00:17:44,981
I was not brave.
And I did not hunt as one.

128
00:17:46,849 --> 00:17:50,276
The Fathers of the Yagahl
played with us today.

129
00:17:50,471 --> 00:17:53,647
What should I do?
If I give up the White Spear, I give up Evolet.

130
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:55,018
What should I do?
If I give up the White Spear, I give up Evolet.

131
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,006
Is she yours to give up?

132
00:18:01,035 --> 00:18:05,963
It is not the way of the Yagahl to
claim the White Spear with a lie.

133
00:18:27,323 --> 00:18:31,806
- I gave the White Spear back to Tic'Tic.
- Why would you do such a thing?

134
00:18:32,141 --> 00:18:36,411
- I did not kill the manak, Evolet.
- Yes you did. You held on to the net.

135
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,106
No, I lied!

136
00:18:41,337 --> 00:18:45,471
I tried to let go with all the others.
My hand was caught in it.

137
00:18:47,578 --> 00:18:50,067
Then the manak ran into my spear.

138
00:18:51,603 --> 00:18:53,607
I did nothing!

139
00:18:57,494 --> 00:19:01,407
Evolet, remember what I
told you about our light?

140
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:05,917
I still feel the same.

141
00:19:06,844 --> 00:19:09,701
You will always be in my heart.

142
00:19:10,063 --> 00:19:12,183
That will never go away.

143
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,915
But still...

144
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:20,060
you're giving me up.

145
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:40,241
That night the great white rain
came to the valley of the Yagahl.

146
00:19:40,276 --> 00:19:45,024
And like an icy rain, sadness
fell over D'Leh's heart.

147
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:52,382
And with the white rain
came the four-legged demons.

148
00:20:11,486 --> 00:20:13,175
Stay here.

149
00:20:57,216 --> 00:20:58,695
Moha!
Watch out!

150
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,444
Baku, hide you!
Yes mother.

151
00:21:54,216 --> 00:21:55,842
We cannot help them.

152
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,248
Let me...

153
00:22:22,364 --> 00:22:23,939
Let me go!

154
00:23:02,295 --> 00:23:04,264
- What are you doing?
- I'm going after them.

155
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,234
Over the Great Mountains?
That is not possible.

156
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:08,685
They came over the Great Mountains,
did they not?

157
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,486
- They are demons. Maybe they can fly.
- I did not see wings on them, did you?

158
00:23:12,786 --> 00:23:15,610
You think you can bring a God down alone?
Who are you?

159
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,076
He is not alone.

160
00:23:17,941 --> 00:23:21,216
I go with him.

161
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:24,177
Without the other hunters,
we all will die.

162
00:23:24,212 --> 00:23:26,343
- I will go too.

163
00:23:27,115 --> 00:23:29,326
- No, Baku, you will stay here.

164
00:23:29,714 --> 00:23:32,214
But you, Ka'Ren, you must go with him.

165
00:23:43,587 --> 00:23:45,534
Don't touch me!

166
00:23:59,628 --> 00:24:02,872
And as they bade farewell to the
elders and the children of our people,

167
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:06,129
the Wise Spirit of the Yagahl

168
00:24:06,164 --> 00:24:09,824
blessed them and the
spears by their sides.

169
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:15,290
Old Mother knew they would
never be hunters again

170
00:24:15,325 --> 00:24:18,290
but warriors since then.

171
00:24:33,066 --> 00:24:34,979
It will be night, so we stay here.

172
00:24:35,014 --> 00:24:35,896
No, we go on. We are getting closer.

173
00:24:35,931 --> 00:24:40,114
I cannot see in the dark, can you?
We stay here.

174
00:24:41,075 --> 00:24:43,882
We stay here, we eat and sleep.

175
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:54,581
Why do you not carry the White Spear?

176
00:24:59,318 --> 00:25:00,693
Are you afraid?

177
00:25:00,728 --> 00:25:03,581
- Answer!
- Ka'Ren, go to sleep.

178
00:25:18,545 --> 00:25:22,041
Baku? Baku!
What are you doing here?

179
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,997
- Go home!
- I can help you.

180
00:25:24,967 --> 00:25:27,979
- I can carry the water bag.
- Go home!

181
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,854
They killed my mother!

182
00:25:32,074 --> 00:25:32,769
He's alone.

183
00:25:35,966 --> 00:25:38,117
He will only slow us down.

184
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:41,504
D'Leh, I'm thirsty.

185
00:26:08,115 --> 00:26:11,548
- The fire still lives in these stones.
- D'Leh!

186
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,209
She is alive.
We must hurry!

187
00:26:41,073 --> 00:26:43,445
Why is Old Mother freezing?

188
00:27:00,138 --> 00:27:02,150
White rain is not a friend of the hunter.

189
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:06,231
It swallowed all the marks of
the stolen brothers and sisters.

190
00:27:09,686 --> 00:27:15,447
It was now to the Fathers of
the Yagahl to guide their way.

191
00:27:19,468 --> 00:27:24,319
And they walked for many days
and night to a faraway land

192
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:24,443
where the Great Mountains ended

193
00:27:24,478 --> 00:27:30,248
and where the story of the
child with the blue eyes began.

194
00:27:31,363 --> 00:27:37,104
The place where the four-legged
demons killed Evolet's people.

195
00:27:45,027 --> 00:27:47,901
We've walked for days now.
And still no marks!

196
00:27:47,936 --> 00:27:50,775
- Maybe they do have wings.
- Maybe they do.

197
00:27:51,075 --> 00:27:52,852
But our brothers and sisters do not.

198
00:28:05,244 --> 00:28:07,413
Don't forget to chew.

199
00:29:15,486 --> 00:29:17,110
Maybe she only lost it.

200
00:29:34,794 --> 00:29:39,810
- It is hot here.
- Baku, stay close.

201
00:30:26,017 --> 00:30:28,209
What was that?

202
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:20,527
- We must free them tonight.
- Not tonight.

203
00:31:20,562 --> 00:31:21,852
This is not a good place.

204
00:31:23,665 --> 00:31:26,095
They know there is danger out there,
and they keep a good watch.

205
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,644
We do the same.

206
00:31:27,711 --> 00:31:30,548
I will go first,
then Ka'Ren, then you.

207
00:31:31,457 --> 00:31:34,207
D'Leh! Come!

208
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,684
I understand your pain.

209
00:31:55,974 --> 00:31:58,530
But you must be patient.

210
00:32:57,984 --> 00:32:58,830
D'Leh!

211
00:33:03,444 --> 00:33:04,770
I will never give you up again.

212
00:33:10,593 --> 00:33:11,450
This way!

213
00:33:13,141 --> 00:33:13,545
Go!

214
00:33:45,938 --> 00:33:46,460
D'Leh!

215
00:33:48,036 --> 00:33:49,127
Run!

216
00:34:09,263 --> 00:34:10,310
Over here! This way!

217
00:34:19,436 --> 00:34:20,634
Ka'Ren!

218
00:34:59,646 --> 00:35:00,851
Run! Run!

219
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,730
Tic'Tic! Go!
Tic'Tic!

220
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,911
D'Leh, Evolet, up here!

221
00:36:00,286 --> 00:36:02,856
- D'Leh!
- I'll get the boy!

222
00:36:02,895 --> 00:36:05,749
- No, do not go!
- I will come back for you. I promise.

223
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,762
Baku!

224
00:37:27,466 --> 00:37:29,470
You should not be here.

225
00:37:50,581 --> 00:37:52,144
I think he speaks of D'Leh.

226
00:38:12,264 --> 00:38:15,693
D'Leh will come back.
He promised it to me.

227
00:38:54,421 --> 00:38:58,427
- Ka'Ren, do you think he's still alive?
- Does not matter now.

228
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:01,452
He tried to save us!

229
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:54,195
Forgive me, Tic'Tic.
I should have listened to you.

230
00:39:56,028 --> 00:39:58,910
Tonight, I'll bring you food.

231
00:40:39,764 --> 00:40:43,479
<i>Old Mother was watching over
their journey with all her strength</i>

232
00:40:44,313 --> 00:40:46,741
<i>and her spirit stayed
always by their side.</i>

233
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,198
<i>But that night she could not
rule over the forces of the earth</i>

234
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:58,680
<i>and could not stop the
waters of the heavens.</i>

235
00:41:01,463 --> 00:41:07,109
D'Leh would have to face alone the
mighty beast who rules these lands.

236
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:15,837
Do not eat me when I set you free!

237
00:43:16,879 --> 00:43:19,796
- I feared you were dead.
- Do not fear for me.

238
00:43:20,411 --> 00:43:22,327
Look, over there.

239
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:26,040
There was an attack.
I heard them screaming.

240
00:43:26,792 --> 00:43:29,770
This is where they went.

241
00:44:41,437 --> 00:44:43,840
Tic'Tic, move away.
Come!

242
00:44:48,609 --> 00:44:49,927
D'Leh, come back.

243
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,595
Move away!

244
00:45:08,118 --> 00:45:11,730
You must remember me. I gave you life.

245
00:45:55,571 --> 00:45:57,045
Speak to the Spear Tooth?

246
00:46:01,308 --> 00:46:03,015
How do you come to speak our words?

247
00:46:32,634 --> 00:46:34,030
Do not like Naku food?

248
00:46:36,744 --> 00:46:38,139
It's different, but good.

249
00:46:47,947 --> 00:46:50,827
- We come from over the mountains.
- We know where you come from.

250
00:46:50,862 --> 00:46:53,263
How do you know?
How do you come to speak our words?

251
00:46:54,112 --> 00:46:55,935
A man come from the mountain before.

252
00:46:56,399 --> 00:47:00,503
He was looking for a new land.
Our wise man told me to learn his words.

253
00:47:00,781 --> 00:47:03,068
You, you have his face.

254
00:47:14,078 --> 00:47:15,280
What happened to him?

255
00:47:16,366 --> 00:47:17,994
He was taken a long time ago.

256
00:47:18,886 --> 00:47:20,165
Taken where?

257
00:47:22,375 --> 00:47:23,732
Come.

258
00:47:24,429 --> 00:47:27,182
When your father came to us,
he became my friend.

259
00:47:28,268 --> 00:47:31,252
Then the evil spirits stole your father,

260
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,114
like many of our people.

261
00:47:34,044 --> 00:47:36,176
They bring them to the
nest of the great birds

262
00:47:37,416 --> 00:47:39,162
and fly away over the sand.

263
00:47:40,945 --> 00:47:42,263
Where do they take them?

264
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:45,869
To the Mountain of the Gods.

265
00:47:47,304 --> 00:47:49,669
No one has ever returned.

266
00:47:51,917 --> 00:47:54,786
Our wise man says you will lead us there.

267
00:47:56,919 --> 00:47:59,128
Me?

268
00:48:00,096 --> 00:48:01,803
We have a telling that

269
00:48:02,694 --> 00:48:04,478
one day the one will come

270
00:48:06,339 --> 00:48:08,238
who will free our people.

271
00:48:12,425 --> 00:48:15,217
The one who speaks to the Spear Tooth.

272
00:48:18,357 --> 00:48:20,878
And as the brave people of
the Naku buried their dead,

273
00:48:21,730 --> 00:48:24,716
they sent word to all
the tribes of the land

274
00:48:25,956 --> 00:48:28,863
that the one who speaks
to Spear Tooth had come.

275
00:48:32,507 --> 00:48:34,796
Their call was a call for war.

276
00:48:38,594 --> 00:48:40,222
Why do they think I
can free their people?

277
00:48:47,085 --> 00:48:49,023
There's something you must
know about your father.

278
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:55,212
When your mother died bringing you life,

279
00:48:58,095 --> 00:49:01,801
your father took upon himself
not only the weight of you,

280
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:03,988
but all our people.

281
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:05,850
We were starving.

282
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:08,912
He could not wait for Old
Mother's prophecy to come true.

283
00:49:12,091 --> 00:49:13,680
Your father did not run away.

284
00:49:15,193 --> 00:49:17,092
He left to save our people.

285
00:49:17,402 --> 00:49:19,185
How could you let me
believe all this time

286
00:49:19,341 --> 00:49:21,395
that my father betrayed us?

287
00:49:21,745 --> 00:49:24,031
Because he wanted you to be that way.

288
00:49:25,312 --> 00:49:27,598
Your father carried the White Spear.

289
00:49:28,452 --> 00:49:30,700
He feared that when he left,
others would follow him

290
00:49:31,514 --> 00:49:33,723
and abandon our people.

291
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:37,601
And why do you tell me this now?

292
00:49:39,859 --> 00:49:41,306
A good man...

293
00:49:42,997 --> 00:49:44,844
draws a circle around himself
and cares for those within.

294
00:49:47,975 --> 00:49:49,278
His woman, his children.

295
00:49:50,550 --> 00:49:54,852
Other men draw a larger circle and
bring within their brothers and sisters.

296
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:58,265
Some men

297
00:49:58,497 --> 00:50:00,086
have a great destiny.

298
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:03,227
They must draw around themselves

299
00:50:03,653 --> 00:50:06,868
a circle that encloses many, many more.

300
00:50:08,887 --> 00:50:12,493
Your father... was one of those men.

301
00:50:16,602 --> 00:50:18,270
You must decide for yourself

302
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:22,019
whether you are as well.

303
00:50:36,636 --> 00:50:38,376
This is Kawu, our fastest runner.

304
00:50:41,972 --> 00:50:43,325
He bring voice from the
people who live that way.

305
00:50:44,691 --> 00:50:46,298
They stole many more men.

306
00:50:46,299 --> 00:50:49,449
And now they are moving
to the great birds, fast.

307
00:50:49,723 --> 00:50:52,174
We must find them before
they reach these birds.

308
00:51:08,884 --> 00:51:10,470
You have no woman?

309
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:13,796
The day before you came,

310
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:16,579
they took her life.

311
00:51:19,014 --> 00:51:20,185
And they stole our son.

312
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:39,858
I am Baku.

313
00:51:41,838 --> 00:51:45,979
- Tudu.
- No, I am Baku.

314
00:51:47,425 --> 00:51:50,733
Baku, Tudu.
Baku, Tudu.

315
00:52:14,737 --> 00:52:17,057
He's killing him! You must help!

316
00:52:46,469 --> 00:52:51,545
<i>The word of the Naku traveled fast
and from all winds came many warriors.</i>

317
00:52:52,685 --> 00:52:57,038
<i>The TukTuk, who move like big running
birds and hide their eyes behind trees.</i>

318
00:52:51,547 --> 00:53:06,393
<i>And from the valley without sun came
the ones with blood on their heads.</i>

319
00:53:07,736 --> 00:53:10,246
<i>But the strongest of
them all were the Huta.</i>

320
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:15,346
<i>Their leader spoke for all
the warriors of the land.</i>

321
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:31,588
Tell him if his people walk with us,
we will bring them down.

322
00:53:39,104 --> 00:53:41,512
He says you are only a boy.

323
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:47,247
Tell him I am older than I look.

324
00:53:50,049 --> 00:53:52,868
Quina is a Hoda. Hoda do not laugh.

325
00:54:23,639 --> 00:54:28,761
<i>They walked faster and faster and
did not slow down to eat or to rest.</i>

326
00:54:29,868 --> 00:54:32,740
<i>And more spears joined
them with each passing day.</i>

327
00:54:41,473 --> 00:54:43,896
This word "yahala", what does it mean?

328
00:54:43,923 --> 00:54:47,190
They are your words:
"We must bring them down."

329
00:55:04,745 --> 00:55:06,174
The great birds have arrived.

330
00:55:22,903 --> 00:55:23,667
Evolet!

331
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:29,033
Evolet!

332
00:55:29,569 --> 00:55:31,424
Baku, D'Leh's here!

333
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:12,940
Tudu, that man with the spear,
he will not give up.

334
00:56:13,540 --> 00:56:15,081
Him and her.

335
00:56:17,211 --> 00:56:19,117
Maybe the boy is right.

336
00:56:20,111 --> 00:56:22,017
D'Leh cannot fly over
the water like they can.

337
00:56:22,044 --> 00:56:23,950
But who the fuck could
fight so many spears?

338
00:56:30,744 --> 00:56:32,650
This river moves like a snake in the sun.

339
00:56:34,611 --> 00:56:37,484
He says the eye of the
snake rest under the sun

340
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:42,310
and under the moon does not move.

341
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:43,768
Is there a shorter way
to the head of the snake?

342
00:56:49,112 --> 00:56:52,559
We must look beyond the Great Sand.
But no one can walk that far.

343
00:56:53,172 --> 00:56:57,252
The mountains and the sand,
they all look the same.

344
00:56:58,006 --> 00:57:00,201
And we will lose our way.

345
00:57:00,906 --> 00:57:03,102
We will all day.

346
00:57:06,705 --> 00:57:08,902
We will find the head of the snake.

347
00:57:10,573 --> 00:57:12,769
And we will free our people!

348
00:57:34,735 --> 00:57:35,557
We must rest.

349
00:57:37,696 --> 00:57:40,506
<i>The man from the river
had spoken the truth.</i>

350
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,466
<i>They had walked in circles for
many days and lost their way.</i>

351
00:57:46,917 --> 00:57:50,717
<i>And the eye of the snake
was nowhere to be found.</i>

352
00:58:46,154 --> 00:58:49,384
Tic'Tic, Tic'Tic...
I found the eye of the snake!

353
00:58:49,809 --> 00:58:51,260
You see that light? That one?

354
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:54,194
Remember what the river people said?

355
00:58:54,229 --> 00:58:57,213
It rests under the sun,
but under the moon it does not move.

356
00:58:58,789 --> 00:59:00,316
Nakudu, tell them what I said.

357
00:59:01,106 --> 00:59:02,508
It will guide us to
the head of the snake.

358
00:59:20,836 --> 00:59:24,165
<i>And as the last moon had come
to the valley of the Yagahl,</i>

359
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,757
<i>it seemed that all spirits
had left Old Mother.</i>

360
00:59:28,575 --> 00:59:31,962
<i>She did not eat or speak for many moons</i>

361
00:59:32,712 --> 00:59:37,657
<i>because she knew there was
one last destiny to fulfill.</i>

362
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:38,796
Wise Spirit...

363
00:59:40,378 --> 00:59:41,350
It's me, Katan.

364
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:23,828
The mountains of the gods

365
01:00:25,771 --> 01:00:26,929
and the head of the snake.

366
01:01:43,254 --> 01:01:45,466
- Evolet, you are well?
- Ssh, don't speak.

367
01:01:58,574 --> 01:01:59,654
Baku, over here!

368
01:02:05,039 --> 01:02:07,929
How can a man do such a
thing to a father manak?

369
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,183
They are not men like us, Baku.

370
01:02:10,408 --> 01:02:12,334
Then what are they?

371
01:02:12,341 --> 01:02:14,247
Some say they came from the stars.

372
01:02:14,859 --> 01:02:18,082
Others believe that they
flew across the Great Water

373
01:02:18,117 --> 01:02:19,336
when their land sank into the sea.

374
01:03:36,126 --> 01:03:38,323
The ones they force to do their work,

375
01:03:49,336 --> 01:03:50,387
They are even more.

376
01:03:52,093 --> 01:03:53,843
You think they will fight with us?

377
01:03:55,129 --> 01:03:56,999
That is for you to find out.

378
01:04:52,131 --> 01:04:53,997
D'Leh! D'Leh!

379
01:04:57,649 --> 01:04:59,805
Do not be afraid, Baku.
I'll bring you home.

380
01:05:01,840 --> 01:05:06,927
- Where is Evolet?
- The women sleep in different huts.

381
01:05:06,961 --> 01:05:09,427
But I saw her today.

382
01:05:10,887 --> 01:05:14,909
Tic'Tic is waiting with
many spears by the sand.

383
01:05:14,943 --> 01:05:19,235
They killed Moha today.
He was sacrificed.

384
01:05:19,269 --> 01:05:23,460
It is my mistake that they
are in this terrible mess.

385
01:05:23,523 --> 01:05:24,717
I need your forgiveness.

386
01:05:25,753 --> 01:05:30,611
The Fathers chose you to lead us.

387
01:05:30,645 --> 01:05:33,743
And we will stand by your side.

388
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:42,753
Tell them how many spears we have.

389
01:05:48,715 --> 01:05:52,911
The number of spears does not matter.
Men cannot bring down Gods.

390
01:06:17,992 --> 01:06:20,240
He says the blind man
knows much about the Gods.

391
01:06:22,106 --> 01:06:23,666
He was once their servant, but ran away.

392
01:06:23,851 --> 01:06:26,356
They have hidden him here ever since.

393
01:06:26,391 --> 01:06:27,597
Wise man..

394
01:06:29,732 --> 01:06:31,836
Tell us more of these Gods.

395
01:06:41,571 --> 01:06:44,830
They were three,
but now there's only one left.

396
01:06:44,865 --> 01:06:46,173
There must be a way to defeat him.

397
01:06:51,031 --> 01:06:54,436
He said, once, only once he heard the God

398
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:57,311
speak of one he fears.

399
01:06:57,345 --> 01:07:00,993
They have a telling of
one who wears the mark

400
01:07:01,027 --> 01:07:04,052
that you can see in the sky at night.

401
01:07:04,086 --> 01:07:07,721
They call it Uruana,
"the Mark of the Hunter".

402
01:07:09,898 --> 01:07:13,017
The brightest star of all heaven.

403
01:07:18,870 --> 01:07:21,791
He asks if you wear
the Mark of the Hunter.

404
01:07:31,643 --> 01:07:34,111
Without the mark,
you cannot bring down the God.

405
01:07:46,843 --> 01:07:48,701
Wait, wait. The band on your arm.

406
01:07:50,013 --> 01:07:53,690
Where did you get it?

407
01:07:53,724 --> 01:07:57,466
- The man who saved his life.
- Where is he?

408
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:01,938
His bones are buried in the
sand with all the others.

409
01:08:04,626 --> 01:08:06,201
He wants to know why you ask of this man.

410
01:08:06,384 --> 01:08:08,978
He was my father.

411
01:08:38,185 --> 01:08:39,968
Ask him where Tic'Tic is.

412
01:08:43,037 --> 01:08:44,561
They got on us!

413
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:49,721
I am full of days.

414
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,723
Please, great hunter, do not say that.

415
01:09:52,363 --> 01:09:54,574
We need you.

416
01:09:57,106 --> 01:09:59,213
They will not fight with us.

417
01:10:00,002 --> 01:10:03,499
They have their own prophecy.

418
01:10:05,832 --> 01:10:11,441
A prophecy has many faces,
many ways to come true.

419
01:10:11,476 --> 01:10:13,412
Your father, he gave this to me.

420
01:10:14,034 --> 01:10:18,417
- No, great hunter, this is yours--
- Take it.

421
01:10:23,697 --> 01:10:24,502
Be as your father.

422
01:10:35,088 --> 01:10:36,226
Be as your father.

423
01:14:26,537 --> 01:14:29,201
I know how it feels
to lose a good friend.

424
01:14:31,628 --> 01:14:34,124
Your father was mine.

425
01:14:34,896 --> 01:14:36,979
I barely remember him.

426
01:14:37,311 --> 01:14:39,432
He remembered you.

427
01:14:41,110 --> 01:14:46,185
His heart hurt when he spoke about
a boy beyond the Great Mountains.

428
01:14:46,468 --> 01:14:49,482
He was preparing to
leave to go back to you.

429
01:14:49,999 --> 01:14:53,194
That is when he was taken.

430
01:14:58,598 --> 01:15:00,460
D'Leh,

431
01:15:00,494 --> 01:15:02,328
the men are waiting.

432
01:15:59,761 --> 01:16:03,262
We, the people of the Yagahl,

433
01:16:05,687 --> 01:16:07,646
hunt the mightiest of beasts, the manak.

434
01:16:10,675 --> 01:16:14,439
He is great and we are small,
and still we bring him down.

435
01:16:20,056 --> 01:16:23,200
Because we hunt together. As one.

436
01:16:25,994 --> 01:16:27,314
When the sun arises,

437
01:16:29,019 --> 01:16:32,423
we will join our brothers and
sisters on the Mountain of the God

438
01:16:33,530 --> 01:16:35,460
and convince them to fight with us

439
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:37,802
together, as one!

440
01:17:07,384 --> 01:17:08,643
What just happened?

441
01:17:10,297 --> 01:17:14,158
Listen, Baku, today you
must become a hunter.

442
01:17:14,193 --> 01:17:15,208
Me?

443
01:17:21,319 --> 01:17:23,289
"Yahala."

444
01:18:10,271 --> 01:18:13,801
Look. That one.

445
01:18:14,980 --> 01:18:17,812
Baku, we found the real bull. Go.

446
01:19:23,437 --> 01:19:25,067
Ka'Ren, look!

447
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:30,771
We must go everybody up the ramp! Go, go!

448
01:19:30,772 --> 01:19:35,205
Ka'Ren! No!

449
01:22:15,348 --> 01:22:16,450
Stop!

450
01:22:59,814 --> 01:23:02,706
He says the one who follows
this woman should turn back,

451
01:23:02,941 --> 01:23:04,712
or she will die.

452
01:23:08,981 --> 01:23:11,210
Like this traitor.

453
01:23:15,546 --> 01:23:19,824
Turn back to your mountains.
You can take your woman.

454
01:23:28,627 --> 01:23:31,741
Tell him I'll take his offer.

455
01:23:34,915 --> 01:23:37,989
Tell him I accept.

456
01:23:39,619 --> 01:23:41,123
Tell him!

457
01:23:46,428 --> 01:23:48,926
But I will take all my people with me.

458
01:23:50,979 --> 01:23:54,781
Each and every Yagahl.

459
01:23:56,494 --> 01:23:57,910
Tell him!

460
01:24:14,108 --> 01:24:15,092
They are yours!

461
01:24:17,172 --> 01:24:19,372
Ask him what will happen to the others!

462
01:24:38,786 --> 01:24:39,836
They belong to the God, he says.

463
01:24:40,957 --> 01:24:42,817
They will do his work. Forever.

464
01:24:48,099 --> 01:24:49,717
No..

465
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:53,963
I will not!

466
01:25:17,533 --> 01:25:19,690
He is not a God!

467
01:25:48,408 --> 01:25:51,210
D'Leh!

468
01:26:13,559 --> 01:26:15,202
No!

469
01:27:22,283 --> 01:27:23,623
Nooo!

470
01:27:44,889 --> 01:27:47,581
Help! Help!
She is bleeding!

471
01:28:33,317 --> 01:28:35,457
You came for me.

472
01:28:49,717 --> 01:28:52,706
Please, no. Please.

473
01:29:51,992 --> 01:29:53,929
<i>To have journeyed so far,</i>

474
01:29:54,532 --> 01:29:57,547
<i>to have walked till the end of the world</i>

475
01:29:57,551 --> 01:30:00,044
<i>to bring down the one
they call the Almighty</i>

476
01:30:00,079 --> 01:30:03,317
<i>only to return without Evolet,</i>

477
01:30:04,318 --> 01:30:07,575
<i>this was not what Old
Mother had foretold.</i>

478
01:30:16,359 --> 01:30:18,252
<i>But just as she was lost to him forever,</i>

479
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:22,996
<i>the legend of the child
with the blue eyes began</i>

480
01:31:44,019 --> 01:31:47,647
<i>Evolet had brought the
promise of life to our people.</i>

481
01:31:48,993 --> 01:31:51,551
<i>And now, with her last breath,</i>

482
01:31:52,283 --> 01:31:54,952
<i>Old Mother had given it back.</i>

483
01:32:00,686 --> 01:32:03,191
Your father wanted to
bring these back to you.

484
01:32:04,386 --> 01:32:06,380
They will feed your people.

485
01:32:06,414 --> 01:32:09,803
Tell them the people of the
Yagahl thank the Naku people.

486
01:32:21,184 --> 01:32:22,544
Thank you, brother Nakudu.

487
01:32:26,895 --> 01:32:29,169
My heart walks with you, brother D'Leh.

488
01:32:40,950 --> 01:32:44,866
<i>That was the last time they
saw their friends the Naku.</i>

489
01:32:50,050 --> 01:32:53,089
<i>And then the long journey home began.</i>

490
01:33:08,275 --> 01:33:10,050
They're back! They're back!

491
01:33:16,934 --> 01:33:19,799
<i>And as the ones who
walked with the Fathers</i>

492
01:33:19,836 --> 01:33:21,250
<i>looked down on them and guided their way,</i>

493
01:33:22,252 --> 01:33:24,992
<i>so the Yagahl looked to Evolet and D'Leh</i>

494
01:33:25,027 --> 01:33:28,075
<i>to guide their people.</i>

495
01:33:30,210 --> 01:33:34,137
<i>And when the first moon was
born again to their valley,</i>

496
01:33:34,171 --> 01:33:38,324
<i>it brought with it the
first fruits of their land.</i>

497
01:33:38,358 --> 01:33:40,987
Look how fast it is growing.

498
01:33:50,847 --> 01:33:55,217
<i>And so it came to pass
that the promise of life</i>

499
01:33:55,251 --> 01:33:58,136
<i>was fulfilled.</i>
