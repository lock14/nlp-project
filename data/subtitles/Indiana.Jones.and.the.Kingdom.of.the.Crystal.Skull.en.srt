1
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,200
Come on, let's go! Let's go!

2
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,901
Hey! Hey, guys!

3
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:20,802
Faster!

4
00:01:22,201 --> 00:01:23,801
Hey, what you got under there?

5
00:01:23,902 --> 00:01:25,602
- Hey, you want to race?
- Oh, please.

6
00:01:25,701 --> 00:01:27,703
- Come on!
- Come on, let's go!

7
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:36,903
Come on!

8
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:42,903
- Please?
- Come on! Let's go! Come on!

9
00:01:59,504 --> 00:02:01,006
Come on. Let's go.

10
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:05,506
Go faster! Faster!

11
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,110
Sorry, gentlemen.

12
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,010
This whole area is closed for
weapons testing for the next 24 hours.

13
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:01,110
That includes all on-base personnel.

14
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:03,012
Good afternoon, sir.

15
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,812
I'm afraid that goes for you, too,
Colonel, sir.

16
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:13,211
The Pentagon sent out revised...

17
00:04:37,418 --> 00:04:38,718
Russians.

18
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:42,819
This ain't gonna be easy.

19
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,720
Not as easy as it used to be.

20
00:04:44,819 --> 00:04:47,521
- Well, we've been through worse.
- Yeah? When?

21
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,519
Flensburg. There was twice as many.

22
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,920
- We were younger.
- I still am young!

23
00:04:52,019 --> 00:04:53,321
We had guns.

24
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,221
Put your hands down, will you?
You're embarrassing us.

25
00:04:57,321 --> 00:04:59,822
Bet you 500 bucks
we can get out of this.

26
00:05:09,922 --> 00:05:11,622
Let's call it 100.

27
00:05:15,423 --> 00:05:17,523
You recognize building, yes?

28
00:05:24,423 --> 00:05:25,723
Drop dead.

29
00:05:31,223 --> 00:05:33,124
I'm sorry.

30
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:35,524
I meant drop dead, comrade.

31
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:56,026
- Where was he found?
- In Mexico.

32
00:05:56,127 --> 00:05:59,725
They were digging in the dirt,
looking for this stuff.

33
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:07,127
You're not from around here, are you?

34
00:06:07,226 --> 00:06:11,827
Where is it you would imagine
I am from, Dr. Jones?

35
00:06:12,927 --> 00:06:15,026
Well, the way you're sinking your teeth
into those wubble-u's,

36
00:06:15,127 --> 00:06:18,528
I should think maybe Eastern Ukraine.

37
00:06:18,627 --> 00:06:20,528
Highest marks.

38
00:06:20,627 --> 00:06:22,629
Colonel Dr. Irina Spalko.

39
00:06:24,629 --> 00:06:28,028
Three times
I have received Order of Lenin.

40
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:32,129
Also medal as Hero of Socialist Labor.

41
00:06:32,228 --> 00:06:33,528
And why?

42
00:06:34,829 --> 00:06:39,730
Because I know things.
I know them before anyone else.

43
00:06:39,829 --> 00:06:43,031
And what I do not know, I find out.

44
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:48,829
Now, what I need to know now
is in here.

45
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:08,632
- You are a hard man to read, Dr. Jones.
- Ouch.

46
00:07:08,831 --> 00:07:13,533
So, we will do this,
what is expression, old-fashioned way.

47
00:07:13,632 --> 00:07:17,132
You will tell us.
You will help us find what we seek.

48
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:41,834
This warehouse
is where you and your government

49
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,634
have hidden all of your secrets, yes?

50
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:48,935
This is a military warehouse.
I've never been here before in my life.

51
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,836
Object we seek,
rectangular storage container,

52
00:07:52,937 --> 00:07:56,637
dimensions 2 meters by 0.5 meter
by 66 centimeters.

53
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:59,836
Contents of box, mummified remains.

54
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:02,336
This is no doubt familiar to you.

55
00:08:02,437 --> 00:08:05,838
What makes you think I've got any idea
what box you're talking about?

56
00:08:05,937 --> 00:08:07,937
Because 10 years ago

57
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:11,038
you were part of the team
that examined it.

58
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:15,637
Look...

59
00:08:15,737 --> 00:08:19,237
Even if I
knew what you were talking about...

60
00:08:19,338 --> 00:08:22,838
You will help us find it.

61
00:08:34,139 --> 00:08:36,639
Compass. I need a compass.

62
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,440
You know, north, south, east...

63
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:39,840
West.

64
00:08:41,441 --> 00:08:43,040
No compass?

65
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,841
I need your bullets.

66
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:57,841
The contents of that box
are highly magnetized.

67
00:08:57,942 --> 00:08:59,042
I need gunpowder.

68
00:08:59,142 --> 00:09:02,043
You want my help or not?

69
00:09:14,943 --> 00:09:19,144
Don't toy with me, Dr. Jones.
What is the point of all this?

70
00:09:19,244 --> 00:09:21,144
If it's still magnetic,

71
00:09:21,244 --> 00:09:24,443
the metal in this gunpowder
should point the way.

72
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:57,647
Shells. Give me some shotgun shells.

73
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:02,147
Pliers.

74
00:13:20,365 --> 00:13:24,166
Drop the guns,
or Colonel Dr. Spalko is dead.

75
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,767
Why, Mac?

76
00:13:46,866 --> 00:13:49,267
Well, what can I say, Jonesey?

77
00:13:49,366 --> 00:13:52,668
I'm a capitalist, and they pay.

78
00:13:54,567 --> 00:13:57,769
After all those years
we spent spying on the Reds?

79
00:13:59,868 --> 00:14:02,268
I thought we were friends, Mac.

80
00:14:02,368 --> 00:14:05,469
I've had a run of bad luck
with the cards lately, mate.

81
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:08,068
Awful. Bloody awful.

82
00:14:09,769 --> 00:14:12,370
I can't go home empty-handed again.

83
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,269
No defiant last words, Dr. Jones?

84
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:20,870
I like lke.

85
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,470
Put down gun.

86
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:24,971
You got it, pal.

87
00:14:51,971 --> 00:14:54,273
Damn, I thought that was closer.

88
00:14:58,572 --> 00:14:59,673
Come on. Come on.

89
00:15:18,274 --> 00:15:20,275
He's not to get out of here alive!
Block the exits!

90
00:15:26,274 --> 00:15:28,475
Don't get clever, Boris.
You don't know him.

91
00:15:28,576 --> 00:15:29,576
Know him. Know him.

92
00:15:29,676 --> 00:15:31,775
You don't know him!
You don't know him!

93
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,976
You don't know him! You don't know...

94
00:17:14,984 --> 00:17:16,484
You did well.

95
00:18:56,493 --> 00:18:58,993
Hello? Hello?

96
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:06,095
Hello!

97
00:19:07,496 --> 00:19:09,595
Hey. I knocked. You guys got a...

98
00:19:16,996 --> 00:19:18,395
Wait a minute.

99
00:19:18,496 --> 00:19:20,195
<i>Come on, gang!</i>

100
00:19:33,396 --> 00:19:35,298
Oh, that can't be good.

101
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:41,097
<i>All personnel,
it is now one minute to zero time.</i>

102
00:19:41,398 --> 00:19:43,897
<i>Put on goggles or turn away.</i>

103
00:19:43,998 --> 00:19:49,298
<i>Do not remove goggles or face burst
until 10 seconds after first light.</i>

104
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:50,798
That can't be good at all.

105
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:02,400
Wait! Wait! Wait, wait, wait! Wait!

106
00:20:05,299 --> 00:20:07,700
Sure! Great! Don't wait for me!

107
00:20:07,799 --> 00:20:09,300
<i>Minus 15 seconds.</i>

108
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,800
<i>Minus 10 seconds.</i>

109
00:20:20,101 --> 00:20:26,102
<i>Niner, eight, seven, six,</i>

110
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:29,001
<i>fiver, four,</i>

111
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:34,403
<i>three, two, one, zero.</i>

112
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:08,411
<i>I had no reason to believe
that Mac was a spy.</i>

113
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,810
He was Ml6 when I was in OSS.

114
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:13,811
We did 20, 30 missions together
in Europe and the Pacific.

115
00:22:13,912 --> 00:22:16,311
Don't wave your war record
in our face, Colonel Jones.

116
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:18,310
We all served.

117
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:20,811
No kidding? What side were you on?

118
00:22:20,912 --> 00:22:23,612
I don't think you recognize
the gravity of your situation.

119
00:22:23,711 --> 00:22:26,211
You aided and abetted KGB agents

120
00:22:26,311 --> 00:22:29,512
who broke into
a top-secret military installation

121
00:22:29,613 --> 00:22:32,313
in the middle of the
United States of America, my country.

122
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:35,413
What was in the steel box they took?

123
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:38,212
You tell us. You've seen it before.

124
00:22:42,614 --> 00:22:45,314
You mean that Air Force fiasco in '47.

125
00:22:47,515 --> 00:22:49,714
I was tossed into a bus
with blacked-out windows

126
00:22:49,815 --> 00:22:52,713
and 20 people
I wasn't allowed to speak to.

127
00:22:52,814 --> 00:22:54,815
Hauled out in the middle of the night
in the middle of nowhere

128
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:57,515
on some urgent recovery project
and shown what?

129
00:22:57,615 --> 00:22:58,615
Pieces of wreckage

130
00:22:58,714 --> 00:23:03,415
and an intensely magnetic shroud
covering mutilated remains?

131
00:23:03,516 --> 00:23:06,415
None of us
was ever given the full picture.

132
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:09,116
And we were threatened with treason
if we ever talked about it.

133
00:23:09,217 --> 00:23:11,115
So, you tell me, what was in the box?

134
00:23:11,215 --> 00:23:12,516
Indy, thank God.

135
00:23:12,615 --> 00:23:14,816
Don't you know it's dangerous
to climb into a refrigerator?

136
00:23:14,916 --> 00:23:16,616
Those things can be deathtraps!

137
00:23:16,717 --> 00:23:19,217
Good to see you, too, Bob.

138
00:23:19,317 --> 00:23:21,616
Relax, boys. I can vouch for Dr. Jones.

139
00:23:21,717 --> 00:23:23,617
What the hell is going on?

140
00:23:23,718 --> 00:23:26,417
KGB on American soil?
Who is that woman?

141
00:23:26,518 --> 00:23:28,317
Describe her.

142
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:30,018
Tall, thin, mid-30s,

143
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,817
carried a sword of some kind,
a rapier, I think.

144
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,318
Yeah, that's her.

145
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:39,919
You sure she's here?

146
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,419
Here and gone. Who is she?

147
00:23:42,519 --> 00:23:46,118
Irina Spalko,
she was Stalin's fair-haired girl.

148
00:23:46,219 --> 00:23:50,019
His favorite scientist, if you can call
psychic research science.

149
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:51,220
General Ross...

150
00:23:51,319 --> 00:23:53,519
She's leading teams from the Kremlin
all over the world.

151
00:23:53,619 --> 00:23:54,720
Scooping up artifacts

152
00:23:54,819 --> 00:23:57,520
she thinks might have
paranormal military applications.

153
00:23:57,621 --> 00:24:00,621
- General Ross!
- Back off, Paul.

154
00:24:00,721 --> 00:24:04,221
Not everyone in the Army's a Commie
and certainly not Indy.

155
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:08,721
What exactly am I being accused of,
besides surviving a nuclear blast?

156
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:09,921
Nothing yet.

157
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:11,922
But frankly your association
with George McHale

158
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:16,221
makes all your activities suspicious,
including those during the war.

159
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:18,222
Are you nuts?

160
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:21,622
Do you have any idea how many medals
this son of a bitch won?

161
00:24:21,721 --> 00:24:23,622
A great many, I'm sure.

162
00:24:24,823 --> 00:24:27,423
But does he deserve them?

163
00:24:27,522 --> 00:24:31,523
Dr. Jones, let's just say for now
that you are of interest to the Bureau.

164
00:24:31,624 --> 00:24:33,723
Of great interest.

165
00:24:42,624 --> 00:24:45,424
Grooved Ware in the beginning
of modern drainage practices,

166
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,924
which we also see in Skara Brae
on the west coast of Scotland.

167
00:24:49,025 --> 00:24:51,625
Skara Brae dates from 3100 B.C.

168
00:24:51,726 --> 00:24:54,424
and was continuously occupied
for 600 years

169
00:24:54,525 --> 00:24:57,424
until it was apparently
abandoned in 2500 B.C.

170
00:24:57,525 --> 00:24:59,625
There's no clear evidence
as to why its occupants

171
00:24:59,726 --> 00:25:04,526
decided to abandon
a perfectly healthy environment. Yes?

172
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:08,027
- May I have a moment, Professor?
- Yes.

173
00:25:08,727 --> 00:25:10,625
Open up Michaelson. Review Chapter 4.

174
00:25:10,726 --> 00:25:11,826
When I come back we'll discuss

175
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:14,826
the difference between
migration and exodus.

176
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:22,228
What?

177
00:25:22,928 --> 00:25:25,728
You have no idea the pressure
coming from the Board of Regents.

178
00:25:25,828 --> 00:25:27,128
The FBI showed up this morning,

179
00:25:27,229 --> 00:25:29,827
ransacked your office,
searched all your files!

180
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,728
You're the dean of the college.
Why didn't you stop them?

181
00:25:31,827 --> 00:25:33,028
They have no right.

182
00:25:33,128 --> 00:25:35,528
They had every right!
They weren't vandals.

183
00:25:35,628 --> 00:25:38,028
They were federal agents
with search warrants!

184
00:25:38,229 --> 00:25:41,630
The university isn't gonna get itself
embroiled in that kind of controversy,

185
00:25:41,730 --> 00:25:43,829
not in this charged climate.

186
00:25:44,929 --> 00:25:47,329
So you're firing me.

187
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:51,630
A leave of absence is all.
An indefinite leave of absence.

188
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:53,329
- You are firing me.
- During which

189
00:25:53,431 --> 00:25:56,230
they've agreed to continue to pay
your full salary for a period...

190
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,730
I don't want their money!

191
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,332
Please don't be foolish.

192
00:26:00,432 --> 00:26:02,330
You don't know what I had to go through
to get that for you.

193
00:26:02,431 --> 00:26:05,730
You went through? What exactly
did you have to go through, Charlie?

194
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,132
Henry...

195
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:11,132
I resigned.

196
00:26:18,932 --> 00:26:20,531
Where will you go?

197
00:26:22,032 --> 00:26:25,633
Train to New York,
overnight to London, for starts.

198
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:31,134
I might end up teaching in Leipzig.
Heinrich owes me a favor.

199
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:32,534
I'll wire you when I get settled.

200
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:34,334
You can send on the rest of my things.

201
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:36,634
I suppose
there's nothing to keep you here.

202
00:26:36,733 --> 00:26:38,634
I barely recognize this country anymore.

203
00:26:38,733 --> 00:26:41,835
The government's got us
seeing Communists in our soup.

204
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:46,434
When the hysteria reaches academia,
I guess it's time to call it a career.

205
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:48,536
How did Deirdre take the news?

206
00:26:48,736 --> 00:26:50,935
How does any wife take such things?

207
00:26:51,036 --> 00:26:54,234
The look on her face
was a combination of pride and panic.

208
00:26:54,335 --> 00:26:57,236
I never should've doubted you,
my friend.

209
00:26:57,336 --> 00:27:01,036
No, you have reason to question
your friends these days.

210
00:27:05,737 --> 00:27:08,136
Brutal couple of years, huh, Charlie?

211
00:27:10,137 --> 00:27:12,737
First Dad, then Marcus.

212
00:27:13,836 --> 00:27:16,238
We seem to have reached the age
where life stops giving us things

213
00:27:16,337 --> 00:27:18,538
and starts taking them away.

214
00:27:21,738 --> 00:27:23,838
Just another half glass.

215
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:23,242
Hey!

216
00:28:25,144 --> 00:28:26,544
Hey, old man!

217
00:28:27,743 --> 00:28:31,743
Professor, hello! Hey!
Are you Dr. Jones?

218
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:33,644
You're running out of platform, kid.

219
00:28:33,744 --> 00:28:35,944
Are you a friend of Dr. Oxley's?

220
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:38,443
- Harold Oxley? The archeologist?
- Yeah.

221
00:28:38,544 --> 00:28:40,045
What about him?

222
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:42,244
They're going to kill him.

223
00:28:45,045 --> 00:28:47,945
I haven't talked to Harold Oxley
in 20 years.

224
00:28:49,346 --> 00:28:51,645
He's a brilliant guy.

225
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:54,546
He could put you to sleep
just by talking.

226
00:28:54,645 --> 00:28:57,746
Yeah. Yeah. When I was a kid,
that's how I did get to sleep.

227
00:28:57,846 --> 00:29:01,747
Oxley's voice was better than
a glass of warm milk, you know.

228
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:03,846
The name's Mutt, Mutt Williams.

229
00:29:03,946 --> 00:29:07,048
- Mutt? What kind of name is that?
- Yeah.

230
00:29:07,147 --> 00:29:09,147
It's the one I picked.
You got a problem with it?

231
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:13,548
Take it easy.
What was your relationship to Oxley?

232
00:29:13,647 --> 00:29:18,147
My dad died in the war.
Ox kind of helped my mom raise me.

233
00:29:18,248 --> 00:29:21,148
You were saying
somebody's going to kill him?

234
00:29:23,848 --> 00:29:27,150
Six months ago,
my mom gets a letter from the Ox.

235
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:28,749
He's down in Peru.

236
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:31,548
Found some type of skull,
a crystal skull.

237
00:29:31,648 --> 00:29:35,250
Like the one that guy
Mitchell-Hodgkiss? Hedgkiss?

238
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:37,650
- The one he found.
- Nice jacket.

239
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:43,050
The Ox and I were obsessed with
the Mitchell-Hedges skull in college.

240
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:44,351
How do you know about it?

241
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:45,750
Are you kidding? It's all he talked about.

242
00:29:45,849 --> 00:29:47,651
He'd talk about that thing
till the cows come home.

243
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:49,651
What's it? It's like an idol?

244
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:52,451
Deity carving. Mesoamerican.

245
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,652
There are a number of crystal skulls
in the world.

246
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:57,551
I saw one in the British Museum.

247
00:29:57,852 --> 00:30:01,452
Interesting craftsmanship,
but that's about it.

248
00:30:01,553 --> 00:30:04,352
All right, well, laugh if you want.
Oxley said he found it this time.

249
00:30:04,551 --> 00:30:08,452
He said this was real and he was off
to a place called Akator with it.

250
00:30:08,553 --> 00:30:11,252
- Akator? He said that? You're sure?
- Yeah.

251
00:30:11,353 --> 00:30:15,053
That's what he said.
He said Akator. What is it?

252
00:30:15,153 --> 00:30:18,753
It's a mythical lost city in the Amazon.

253
00:30:18,854 --> 00:30:21,853
Conquistadors called it El Dorado.

254
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:25,953
Supposedly, the Ugha tribe were
chosen by the gods 7,000 years ago

255
00:30:26,054 --> 00:30:29,855
to build a giant city out of solid gold.

256
00:30:29,954 --> 00:30:32,454
It had aqueducts and paved roads

257
00:30:32,555 --> 00:30:37,654
and technology that
wouldn't be seen again for 5,000 years.

258
00:30:37,755 --> 00:30:42,756
Francisco de Orellana disappeared
into the Amazon looking for it in 1546.

259
00:30:43,756 --> 00:30:46,756
I almost died of typhus
looking for it myself.

260
00:30:48,256 --> 00:30:49,656
I don't think it exists.

261
00:30:49,757 --> 00:30:52,557
Why would Ox
want to take the skull there?

262
00:30:52,656 --> 00:30:56,457
The legend says that a crystal skull
was stolen from Akator

263
00:30:56,557 --> 00:30:58,557
in the 15th or 16th century,

264
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:02,257
and that whoever returns the skull
to the city temple

265
00:31:02,356 --> 00:31:04,458
will be given control over its power.

266
00:31:04,557 --> 00:31:08,458
Power. Right. So there's some
kind of power. What's the power?

267
00:31:08,557 --> 00:31:11,558
I don't know, kid. It's just a story.

268
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:12,857
No.

269
00:31:13,758 --> 00:31:15,857
From his letter, my mom thought
the Ox was off his rocker.

270
00:31:15,958 --> 00:31:16,958
You know, smog in the noggin,

271
00:31:17,057 --> 00:31:20,358
so she goes down there to find him,
only he'd already been kidnapped.

272
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:22,259
Now they've got her, too.

273
00:31:22,358 --> 00:31:23,759
Now, Ox said
he hid that skull someplace,

274
00:31:23,858 --> 00:31:27,059
and if my mom doesn't come up with it,
they're gonna kill them both.

275
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,259
Now, she said you'd help me.

276
00:31:30,058 --> 00:31:32,160
Me? What's your mom's name again?

277
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:35,059
Mary. Mary Williams.
You remember her?

278
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,359
There were a lot of Marys, kid.

279
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,560
Shut up! That's my mother
you're talking about!

280
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:40,461
All right? That's my mother.

281
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,560
You don't have to get sore all the time
just to prove how tough you are.

282
00:31:43,661 --> 00:31:45,761
Sit down. Please. Sit down.

283
00:31:47,161 --> 00:31:50,161
She said if anybody could find the skull,
it's you.

284
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:54,761
Like you're some type of...
Like a grave robber or something.

285
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:57,662
I'm a tenured professor of archeology.

286
00:31:57,761 --> 00:32:01,962
Oh, you're a teacher.
Well, that's gonna be a big help.

287
00:32:02,063 --> 00:32:04,061
Anyway, she called me
two weeks ago from South America.

288
00:32:04,162 --> 00:32:06,663
Said she'd escaped,
but they were after her.

289
00:32:06,762 --> 00:32:08,462
She said she'd just gotten
a letter from the Ox

290
00:32:08,563 --> 00:32:10,462
and mailed it to me
so I could give it to you.

291
00:32:10,563 --> 00:32:11,962
Then the line went dead. I opened it.

292
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,463
I mean, the thing's pointless, though.
It's just gibberish.

293
00:32:14,564 --> 00:32:16,963
It's not even English lettering.

294
00:32:17,064 --> 00:32:18,163
See?

295
00:32:20,065 --> 00:32:23,364
See those two bricks over there,
at the counter?

296
00:32:23,463 --> 00:32:26,065
I don't think
they're here for the milkshakes.

297
00:32:26,164 --> 00:32:27,664
Who are they?

298
00:32:28,464 --> 00:32:31,365
Don't know. Maybe FBI.

299
00:32:31,464 --> 00:32:33,165
Come quietly, Dr. Jones.

300
00:32:33,266 --> 00:32:34,665
Make that KGB.

301
00:32:34,766 --> 00:32:37,865
- And bring letter with you.
- Letter? What letter?

302
00:32:37,965 --> 00:32:39,265
Letter Mr. Williams just give you.

303
00:32:39,365 --> 00:32:41,266
Me? Do I look like a mailman?

304
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:43,066
We don't ask again.
Come now or we'll...

305
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:44,365
Or what?

306
00:32:44,465 --> 00:32:47,666
Nice try, kid,
but I think you just brought a knife

307
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,267
to a gunfight.

308
00:32:51,467 --> 00:32:53,067
Outside now.

309
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:58,666
- Hit this guy.
- Who?

310
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,166
Joe College. Hit him hard.

311
00:33:00,267 --> 00:33:02,167
- Here, hold this.
- What?

312
00:33:03,268 --> 00:33:05,067
That's my boyfriend!

313
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:09,969
Take it outside!

314
00:33:10,068 --> 00:33:11,868
Get that greaser!

315
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:21,068
Your mom didn't escape.

316
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:23,869
They let her go,
so she could mail the letter

317
00:33:24,069 --> 00:33:27,170
and you could bring it to me
and I could translate it!

318
00:33:29,471 --> 00:33:31,269
Get on, gramps!

319
00:33:59,772 --> 00:34:02,073
Go, go, go, go, go!

320
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:15,478
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

321
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:21,480
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

322
00:35:21,579 --> 00:35:24,679
Better dead than Red!
Better dead than Red!

323
00:35:26,181 --> 00:35:29,681
This is crazy!
Somebody's going to get hurt!

324
00:35:57,682 --> 00:35:59,382
Left! Go left! Left!

325
00:36:14,585 --> 00:36:16,385
Move, move! Move!

326
00:36:17,085 --> 00:36:18,385
Split, split! Split, split!

327
00:36:18,485 --> 00:36:20,885
- You're going too fast.
- That's a matter of opinion!

328
00:36:33,987 --> 00:36:36,786
- Excuse me, Dr. Jones.
- Yes?

329
00:36:36,887 --> 00:36:40,286
I just had a question on
Hargrove's normative culture model.

330
00:36:40,385 --> 00:36:41,686
Forget Hargrove.

331
00:36:41,786 --> 00:36:44,887
Read Vere Gordon Childe
on diffusionism.

332
00:36:44,987 --> 00:36:47,086
He spent most of his life in the field.

333
00:36:48,188 --> 00:36:51,088
If you want to be a good archeologist,

334
00:36:52,288 --> 00:36:54,789
you got to get out of the library!

335
00:36:59,588 --> 00:37:00,688
Who is that?

336
00:37:00,788 --> 00:37:03,889
Francisco de Orellana,
the conquistador.

337
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:06,188
Remember, the guy who got lost
looking for the skull.

338
00:37:06,289 --> 00:37:09,789
And just as I thought.

339
00:37:09,889 --> 00:37:11,889
Koihoma.

340
00:37:11,989 --> 00:37:13,389
What's that?

341
00:37:13,489 --> 00:37:18,489
It's an extinct Latin American language.
Pre-Columbian syllabic base.

342
00:37:19,789 --> 00:37:23,791
See. Diagonal stresses
on the ideograms. Definitely Koihoma.

343
00:37:23,891 --> 00:37:25,791
- You speak it?
- Nobody speaks it.

344
00:37:25,891 --> 00:37:29,192
It hasn't been heard aloud
in 3,000 years.

345
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:33,490
I might be able to read a bit though
if I walk it through Mayan first.

346
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:36,791
You know, for an old man,
you ain't bad in a fight.

347
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:38,692
Thanks a lot.

348
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:40,692
What are you, like, 80?

349
00:37:44,092 --> 00:37:46,193
It's a riddle.

350
00:37:46,293 --> 00:37:49,793
Leave it to Ox to write a riddle
in a dead language.

351
00:37:51,393 --> 00:37:55,492
"Follow the lines in the earth
only gods can read

352
00:37:55,592 --> 00:37:58,594
"which lead to Orellana's cradle

353
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,994
"guarded by the living dead."

354
00:38:01,094 --> 00:38:03,994
- He's talking about the Nazca Lines.
- What are those?

355
00:38:04,094 --> 00:38:05,393
Hold on here.

356
00:38:06,193 --> 00:38:12,594
Geoglyphs. Giant ancient drawings
carved into the desert floor in Peru.

357
00:38:12,695 --> 00:38:15,494
From the ground,
they don't look like anything.

358
00:38:15,594 --> 00:38:19,195
But from the sky,
only the gods can read them,

359
00:38:19,295 --> 00:38:22,096
because only gods live up there.

360
00:38:24,094 --> 00:38:29,295
Oxley's telling us
the skull is in Nazca, Peru.

361
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,302
Finally. They saw him.

362
00:39:33,402 --> 00:39:36,202
Ox wandered into town a couple
of months ago, raving like a madman.

363
00:39:36,302 --> 00:39:38,702
Police locked him up in the sanitarium.
It's this way.

364
00:39:38,802 --> 00:39:41,302
I took Spanish and I didn't understand
a word of that. What was it?

365
00:39:41,402 --> 00:39:43,503
Quechua, local Incan dialect.

366
00:39:43,603 --> 00:39:46,202
- Where'd you learn that one?
- Long story.

367
00:39:46,302 --> 00:39:47,903
I got time.

368
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:50,402
I rode with Pancho Villa.
A couple of his guys spoke it.

369
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:52,103
Bullshit!

370
00:39:52,202 --> 00:39:54,503
- You asked.
- Pancho Villa?

371
00:39:54,603 --> 00:39:57,704
- Technically, I was kidnapped.
- By Pancho Villa?

372
00:39:57,804 --> 00:40:01,304
It was the fight
against Victoriano Huerta.

373
00:40:01,405 --> 00:40:03,505
- How old were you?
- About your age.

374
00:40:03,704 --> 00:40:06,103
Your parents must've had a cow, huh?

375
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:08,405
It worked out.
Things were a little tense at home.

376
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:10,405
Yeah, me and my mom
aren't on the best of terms, either.

377
00:40:10,505 --> 00:40:13,905
Treat her right, kid. You only get one
and sometimes not for that long.

378
00:40:14,005 --> 00:40:15,306
It's not my fault. It's hers.

379
00:40:15,405 --> 00:40:17,005
She just got P.O.'ed
because I quit school.

380
00:40:17,106 --> 00:40:18,606
She thinks
I'm some kind of goof or something.

381
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:20,905
- You quit school?
- Oh, yeah. Sure. Tons of them.

382
00:40:21,005 --> 00:40:23,106
Fancy prep schools
that teach you how to debate

383
00:40:23,206 --> 00:40:24,905
and chess and fencing.

384
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:27,106
I'm great with the blade.
I just think it's a waste of time.

385
00:40:27,206 --> 00:40:29,306
- You never finished.
- No.

386
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:32,007
Just a bunch of useless skills.
Wrong books.

387
00:40:32,106 --> 00:40:34,407
'Cause I love reading.
Me and Ox used to read all the time.

388
00:40:34,507 --> 00:40:37,007
But now I can pick them myself.
You get me?

389
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:39,708
- What do you do for money?
- Fix motorcycles.

390
00:40:39,807 --> 00:40:42,507
Gonna do that
for the rest of your life?

391
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:45,108
Maybe I will, Teach.
You got a problem with that?

392
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:47,708
No. Not if that's what you love doing.

393
00:40:47,807 --> 00:40:50,608
Don't let anybody tell you different.

394
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,509
This is it. Sister.

395
00:41:12,411 --> 00:41:15,809
She says Ox isn't here.
She doesn't know where he is.

396
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:20,911
Some men came and took him away,
men with guns.

397
00:41:26,311 --> 00:41:28,211
She says he was obsessed, deranged.

398
00:41:28,311 --> 00:41:30,813
Drew pictures
all over the walls of his cell.

399
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:38,413
This riddle in Oxley's letter
doesn't make any sense.

400
00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:44,114
"Follow the lines that only the gods
can read that lead to Orellana's cradle."

401
00:41:44,213 --> 00:41:46,514
Cradle, cradle, birth.

402
00:41:46,614 --> 00:41:49,612
Orellana wasn't born in Peru.
He was born in Spain.

403
00:41:49,713 --> 00:41:51,614
He was a conquistador.
He came here for the gold.

404
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:53,114
What happened to him?

405
00:41:53,213 --> 00:41:57,414
He disappeared along with six others.
Their bodies were never found.

406
00:42:26,717 --> 00:42:28,916
He must have lost his mind.

407
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:38,918
Ox, man, what happened?
What happened?

408
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:49,719
This is not the Mitchell-Hedges skull.

409
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:52,119
Look at the elongated cranium.

410
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:55,019
And the same word

411
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:57,320
in different languages,
over and over again.

412
00:43:01,719 --> 00:43:03,519
Return.

413
00:43:03,619 --> 00:43:05,320
Return where?

414
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,420
Or return what?

415
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:10,021
You mean the skull?

416
00:43:10,121 --> 00:43:12,621
Seems to have been on his mind.

417
00:43:12,721 --> 00:43:15,320
Where was he supposed to return it to?

418
00:43:27,722 --> 00:43:29,322
- Sweep.
- Yeah.

419
00:43:39,023 --> 00:43:41,623
Ox didn't mean Orellana's birthplace.

420
00:43:41,724 --> 00:43:44,123
Cradle has another meaning in Mayan.

421
00:43:44,224 --> 00:43:49,224
Literally, it means "resting place,"
as in final resting place.

422
00:43:49,324 --> 00:43:51,623
Ox meant Orellana's grave.

423
00:43:51,724 --> 00:43:56,824
This drawing scratched into the floor
is the cemetery where he's buried.

424
00:43:57,324 --> 00:43:59,824
You said Orellana vanished
and nobody ever found his grave.

425
00:44:00,025 --> 00:44:03,726
Well, it looks like Harold Oxley did.

426
00:44:34,628 --> 00:44:36,728
"Grave robbers will be shot."

427
00:44:36,829 --> 00:44:38,829
Good thing we're not grave robbers.

428
00:44:46,728 --> 00:44:49,929
- What are we looking for?
- I don't know yet.

429
00:44:50,429 --> 00:44:53,929
Maybe an antechamber
off one of these barrows.

430
00:45:09,731 --> 00:45:11,231
I think I just saw something!

431
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:13,632
Oh, you're jumping at shadows.

432
00:45:18,331 --> 00:45:20,231
This way down.

433
00:45:29,132 --> 00:45:31,733
- This way up.
- Yeah.

434
00:45:56,034 --> 00:45:57,934
Those darts are poison!

435
00:45:59,635 --> 00:46:01,135
Stay there.

436
00:46:25,536 --> 00:46:28,137
You're a teacher?

437
00:46:29,338 --> 00:46:30,637
Part-time.

438
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,938
Dead end.

439
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:45,539
Maybe.

440
00:46:52,039 --> 00:46:53,239
What are you doing?
Put that thing away.

441
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,740
Give me some light over here.

442
00:47:01,740 --> 00:47:03,541
Bring it over here.

443
00:47:10,442 --> 00:47:12,141
It's just a thing.

444
00:48:12,246 --> 00:48:13,847
Dance on your own dime, will you?

445
00:48:13,947 --> 00:48:15,947
One of the scorpions just stung me!
Am I gonna die?

446
00:48:16,047 --> 00:48:18,148
- How big?
- Huge!

447
00:48:18,248 --> 00:48:19,748
- Good.
- Good?

448
00:48:21,248 --> 00:48:24,148
When it comes to scorpions,
the bigger the better.

449
00:48:24,248 --> 00:48:27,648
A small one bites you,
don't keep it to yourself.

450
00:48:48,449 --> 00:48:52,550
Their skulls. Look at their skulls, man.

451
00:48:52,650 --> 00:48:56,351
Like the drawings in Oxley's cell.
Means we're getting closer.

452
00:48:56,451 --> 00:48:58,452
That's crazy. Why is it like that?

453
00:48:58,652 --> 00:49:02,050
Nazca Indians used to
bind their infants' heads with rope

454
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,650
to elongate the skull like that.

455
00:49:03,851 --> 00:49:06,452
- Why?
- Honor the gods.

456
00:49:06,552 --> 00:49:09,751
No, no. God's head is not like that, man.

457
00:49:09,851 --> 00:49:11,952
Depends on who your god is.

458
00:49:22,052 --> 00:49:24,052
You're going nowhere fast.

459
00:49:29,054 --> 00:49:31,554
Professor, this really
is a dead end. Look.

460
00:49:38,753 --> 00:49:39,855
Hey!

461
00:49:57,056 --> 00:50:00,157
Come on, genius. Bring the backpack.

462
00:50:17,757 --> 00:50:20,557
- This is incredible.
- Unreal.

463
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:25,458
Don't touch anything.

464
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,858
Footprints. Somebody's been here.

465
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:33,858
Recently.

466
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:38,559
Two sets of prints.

467
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,760
Same size, could have been
the same person twice.

468
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:45,360
Not bad, kid.

469
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:56,961
One. Two.

470
00:50:57,061 --> 00:51:00,460
Three. Four. Five. Six.

471
00:51:02,161 --> 00:51:03,561
Seven.

472
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:08,362
Orellana and his men might've
made it out of the jungle after all.

473
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:12,563
Give me some light.

474
00:51:18,762 --> 00:51:21,163
You don't have a knife, do you?

475
00:51:44,465 --> 00:51:46,166
Looks like he just died yesterday.

476
00:51:46,365 --> 00:51:48,965
It's the wrappings. They preserved him.

477
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:58,666
What just happened?

478
00:51:58,766 --> 00:52:02,666
He's been wrapped up for 500 years.
Air doesn't agree with him.

479
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,768
Thanks.

480
00:52:16,068 --> 00:52:17,969
I don't want to keep
borrowing yours all the time.

481
00:52:18,068 --> 00:52:21,068
- That's fine.
- I was going to put it back.

482
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:28,869
Is this one open already?

483
00:52:47,871 --> 00:52:50,371
It's him.

484
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:52,771
It's Orellana himself.

485
00:52:57,771 --> 00:53:02,072
They called him The Gilded Man.
His lust for gold was legendary.

486
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,172
It's odd.

487
00:53:07,972 --> 00:53:10,373
Somebody's been here and gone.

488
00:53:10,472 --> 00:53:16,474
But they left all this gold
and all the artifacts.

489
00:53:18,572 --> 00:53:20,773
What were they looking for?

490
00:53:33,876 --> 00:53:35,675
- Hold this.
- No. No.

491
00:53:55,077 --> 00:53:58,177
Unbelievable.

492
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:08,878
No tool marks.

493
00:54:08,978 --> 00:54:11,577
A single piece of seamless quartz.

494
00:54:13,378 --> 00:54:15,978
Cut across the grain.

495
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:20,179
It's not possible, even with
today's technology, it would shatter.

496
00:54:26,679 --> 00:54:28,780
Crystal's not magnetic.

497
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,380
Neither is gold.

498
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,981
What is this thing?

499
00:54:37,081 --> 00:54:41,181
Maybe the Nazca Indians thought
this was their god.

500
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:44,081
- You think this is the one from...
- From Akator.

501
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:53,382
Maybe the Spaniards found this skull
along with all this other loot.

502
00:54:53,481 --> 00:54:56,882
They were headed for their ships
along the shore.

503
00:54:58,282 --> 00:55:01,282
Maybe the Indians caught up with them,

504
00:55:01,382 --> 00:55:03,882
or they got to squabbling
amongst themselves

505
00:55:03,983 --> 00:55:07,382
over their prize, kill each other off.

506
00:55:07,583 --> 00:55:10,784
The Indians wrap them up
and bury them.

507
00:55:10,884 --> 00:55:15,983
A couple of hundred years later,
Oxley shows up here, finds the skull.

508
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:19,684
Takes it away, maybe to Akator.

509
00:55:22,284 --> 00:55:24,784
But then he returns it here.

510
00:55:24,885 --> 00:55:26,585
Return.

511
00:55:26,684 --> 00:55:29,885
Return, like he wrote
on the walls of his cell.

512
00:55:30,686 --> 00:55:34,786
He put it back where he found it. Why?

513
00:55:58,887 --> 00:56:02,487
- Hello, Jonesey.
- Hello, Mac.

514
00:56:35,190 --> 00:56:36,990
You're lucky I turned up, Jonesey.

515
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:39,391
Dovchenko there wanted
to blow your brains out.

516
00:56:39,492 --> 00:56:42,992
That's the third time I've saved your life.

517
00:56:43,092 --> 00:56:45,190
Unshackle me. I'll give you a big hug.

518
00:56:45,291 --> 00:56:48,192
You had a Luger
pointed at the base of your skull

519
00:56:48,291 --> 00:56:50,092
the first time we met.

520
00:56:50,192 --> 00:56:51,992
I had the situation under control.

521
00:56:52,092 --> 00:56:54,592
- You owe me.
- What do you owe them?

522
00:56:56,992 --> 00:56:58,193
After the war, when you turned,

523
00:56:58,293 --> 00:56:59,393
how many names
did you give the Reds?

524
00:56:59,492 --> 00:57:00,893
You're not looking
at the big picture here.

525
00:57:00,994 --> 00:57:02,992
How many good men died
because of you?

526
00:57:03,092 --> 00:57:05,293
Eventually, they're gonna
let me out of this chair, comrade,

527
00:57:05,393 --> 00:57:08,793
and when they do,
I'm going to break your nose.

528
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:12,193
"Comrade"?
You think this is about flags?

529
00:57:12,293 --> 00:57:14,695
About uniforms?
You think this is about lines on a map?

530
00:57:14,795 --> 00:57:16,494
It's just about money, isn't it?

531
00:57:16,594 --> 00:57:18,394
No. Not only money.

532
00:57:21,494 --> 00:57:23,894
A gigantic pile of money.

533
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:27,094
Don't worry about
what the Russians will pay.

534
00:57:27,195 --> 00:57:30,195
It's nothing compared
to what's at Akator.

535
00:57:31,396 --> 00:57:35,797
An entire city of gold.
It's what the conquistadors were after.

536
00:57:37,096 --> 00:57:41,697
For God's sake, Jonesey, we'd be rich!
Richer than Howard Hughes!

537
00:57:41,797 --> 00:57:44,297
Blood money, every nickel.

538
00:57:44,396 --> 00:57:46,597
I need you to see the angle here, mate.

539
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:49,498
Be smart. Do the right thing.
Just like in...

540
00:57:51,398 --> 00:57:53,896
Like in Berlin. Got me?

541
00:57:54,097 --> 00:57:56,097
Just like in Berlin.

542
00:57:56,197 --> 00:57:59,498
You want me to trot off,
or should we sing a song?

543
00:58:00,697 --> 00:58:04,398
How fortunate our failure to kill you,
Dr. Jones.

544
00:58:04,498 --> 00:58:07,498
You survive
to be of service to us once again.

545
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,599
Well, you know me, always glad to help.

546
00:58:10,699 --> 00:58:15,199
"Now I am become death,
the destroyer of worlds."

547
00:58:16,099 --> 00:58:18,900
You recognize those words?

548
00:58:19,000 --> 00:58:23,400
It was your own Dr. Oppenheimer
after he created the atomic bomb.

549
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:24,800
He was quoting the Hindu bible.

550
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:27,001
It was nuclear intimidation.

551
00:58:27,101 --> 00:58:31,101
But now this next level of weapon
is ours to have,

552
00:58:31,201 --> 00:58:33,101
yours to fear.

553
00:58:33,201 --> 00:58:35,701
Weapon? What weapon?

554
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,501
A mind weapon.

555
00:58:37,601 --> 00:58:41,402
A new frontier of psychic warfare.
That was Stalin's dream.

556
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:48,202
Now I know why Oxley
put the skull back where he found it.

557
00:58:48,302 --> 00:58:49,501
He knew you were looking for it.

558
00:58:49,601 --> 00:58:51,603
That skull is no mere deity carving.

559
00:58:51,702 --> 00:58:53,702
Surely you knew that
the moment you laid eyes on it.

560
00:58:53,802 --> 00:58:56,802
It was not made by human hands.

561
00:58:56,902 --> 00:58:58,704
Who made it, then?

562
00:59:02,003 --> 00:59:03,402
Come on.

563
00:59:04,903 --> 00:59:07,704
The body we found in New Mexico
was not the first.

564
00:59:07,804 --> 00:59:11,704
We'd already dissected two others
from similar crash sites in Soviet Union.

565
00:59:11,804 --> 00:59:13,505
Saucer men from Mars.

566
00:59:13,605 --> 00:59:15,804
The legends about Akator are all true.

567
00:59:15,905 --> 00:59:18,306
Early men could not have conceived it,
much less built it.

568
00:59:18,405 --> 00:59:20,505
It was a city of supreme beings

569
00:59:20,605 --> 00:59:23,704
with technologies
and paranormal abilities.

570
00:59:23,804 --> 00:59:26,106
You got to be kidding me.

571
00:59:26,206 --> 00:59:29,505
Why do you choose
not to believe your own eyes?

572
00:59:32,106 --> 00:59:35,106
The New Mexico specimen
gave us hope.

573
00:59:35,206 --> 00:59:40,106
Unlike the others we'd found,
its skeleton was pure crystal.

574
00:59:41,907 --> 00:59:46,007
A distant cousin, perhaps. Maybe they,
too, were sent to find Akator.

575
00:59:46,108 --> 00:59:49,208
Perhaps we're all searching
for the same thing.

576
00:59:51,708 --> 00:59:56,208
- There is no other explanation.
- There's always another explanation.

577
00:59:56,307 --> 01:00:00,608
The skull was stolen from Akator
in the 15th century.

578
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:01,809
Whoever returns it...

579
01:00:01,909 --> 01:00:04,309
Returns it to the city temple
will gain control over its powers.

580
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:07,409
I've heard that bedtime story before.

581
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:10,409
It's a legend.
Why do you think Akator even existed?

582
01:00:10,610 --> 01:00:13,009
You should ask your friend
that question.

583
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,309
We're certain he's been there.

584
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:17,610
Oxley?

585
01:00:32,311 --> 01:00:34,612
Ox, it's me, Indy.

586
01:00:35,512 --> 01:00:37,012
Ox?

587
01:00:38,612 --> 01:00:41,012
Ox, you're faking it, right?

588
01:00:41,112 --> 01:00:44,012
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears..."

589
01:00:44,112 --> 01:00:48,012
Ox, listen to me, pal.
Your name is Harold Oxley.

590
01:00:48,213 --> 01:00:49,612
You were born in Leeds, England.

591
01:00:49,713 --> 01:00:52,413
You and I went to school together
at the University of Chicago.

592
01:00:52,512 --> 01:00:55,813
And you were never this interesting.
My name is...

593
01:00:57,313 --> 01:00:59,914
My name is Henry Jones, Jr.

594
01:01:01,315 --> 01:01:02,414
What have you done to him?

595
01:01:02,514 --> 01:01:04,813
We ain't done a thing.
It's the bloody skull.

596
01:01:04,914 --> 01:01:08,114
He is the divining rod
that will lead us to Akator.

597
01:01:08,215 --> 01:01:10,614
But we need someone
to interpret him for us.

598
01:01:10,715 --> 01:01:15,315
His mind, it seems, is quite weak.
Let's hope yours is stronger.

599
01:01:18,016 --> 01:01:22,315
The skull's crystal stimulates an
undeveloped part of the human brain,

600
01:01:22,416 --> 01:01:24,615
opening a psychic channel.

601
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:28,715
Oxley lost control of his mind
by staring too long into its eyes.

602
01:01:28,817 --> 01:01:33,416
We believe you can get through to him
after you have done the same.

603
01:01:33,516 --> 01:01:36,318
I've got a better idea. You look at it.

604
01:01:36,418 --> 01:01:39,416
The skull does not speak to everyone,
it seems.

605
01:01:40,817 --> 01:01:43,418
Surely you're not afraid, Dr. Jones.

606
01:01:43,518 --> 01:01:46,117
You've spent your entire life
searching for answers.

607
01:01:46,217 --> 01:01:49,318
Think of the truth behind those eyes.

608
01:01:49,418 --> 01:01:51,918
There may be
hundreds of skulls at Akator.

609
01:01:52,018 --> 01:01:54,617
Whoever finds them
will control the greatest natural force

610
01:01:54,717 --> 01:01:56,818
the world has ever known.

611
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:01,719
Power over the mind of man.

612
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:05,420
Be careful,
you might get exactly what you wish for.

613
01:02:05,519 --> 01:02:07,019
I usually do.

614
01:02:40,322 --> 01:02:42,623
Imagine.

615
01:02:42,722 --> 01:02:46,422
To peer across the world
and know the enemy's secrets.

616
01:02:46,523 --> 01:02:49,722
To place our thoughts
into the minds of your leaders.

617
01:02:49,822 --> 01:02:52,423
Make your teachers
teach the true version of history,

618
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:55,224
your soldiers attack on our command.

619
01:02:55,523 --> 01:02:58,224
We'll be everywhere at once,
more powerful than a whisper,

620
01:02:58,324 --> 01:02:59,724
invading your dreams,

621
01:02:59,824 --> 01:03:02,925
thinking your thoughts for you
while you sleep.

622
01:03:04,824 --> 01:03:07,724
We will change you, Dr. Jones,

623
01:03:07,824 --> 01:03:10,625
all of you, from the inside.

624
01:03:10,724 --> 01:03:13,425
We will turn you into us.

625
01:03:13,525 --> 01:03:18,226
And the best part?
You won't even know it's happening.

626
01:03:20,626 --> 01:03:21,925
Return.

627
01:03:24,826 --> 01:03:26,126
Return?

628
01:03:29,527 --> 01:03:31,027
That's enough.

629
01:03:33,827 --> 01:03:36,927
That's enough.
If he dies, we can't get there.

630
01:03:38,126 --> 01:03:39,427
Cover it.

631
01:03:44,628 --> 01:03:45,927
Henry.

632
01:03:46,728 --> 01:03:48,728
You all right, Jonesey?

633
01:03:54,530 --> 01:03:55,929
- You broke my nose!
- I told you.

634
01:03:56,028 --> 01:04:00,730
Enough! You will speak to Oxley
and lead us to Akator, yes?

635
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,329
Take him outside.

636
01:04:10,231 --> 01:04:12,829
- You all right, kid?
- They left my bike at the cemetery.

637
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:14,731
- Yeah, but you're all right?
- They left my bike.

638
01:04:14,831 --> 01:04:18,331
Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop, stop.

639
01:04:26,632 --> 01:04:30,431
I'm ready. Don't give these pigs a thing.

640
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:32,132
You heard him.

641
01:04:32,231 --> 01:04:35,733
Clearly I have chosen
the wrong pressure point.

642
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:38,632
Perhaps I can find a more sensitive one.

643
01:04:40,132 --> 01:04:44,333
Get your hands off me,
you rotten Russki son of a bitch!

644
01:04:47,632 --> 01:04:49,333
Indiana Jones.

645
01:04:53,333 --> 01:04:54,733
About time you showed up.

646
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:56,635
- Mom!
- Sweetheart.

647
01:04:56,735 --> 01:04:58,434
"Mom"?

648
01:04:58,534 --> 01:04:59,835
What are you doing here?

649
01:04:59,934 --> 01:05:02,034
Forget about me. Are you all right?

650
01:05:02,135 --> 01:05:04,335
- "Mom"?
- Young man, I specifically told you

651
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:05,934
- not to come here.
- Marion is your mother?

652
01:05:06,135 --> 01:05:08,135
You never wrote that.
You never said that in any phone calls.

653
01:05:08,235 --> 01:05:10,335
Marion Ravenwood is your mother?

654
01:05:10,536 --> 01:05:13,635
For God's sake, Indy, it's not that hard.

655
01:05:13,735 --> 01:05:15,735
No, I mean, I just never thought...

656
01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:17,336
I would have a life after you left.

657
01:05:17,436 --> 01:05:19,936
- That's not what I meant.
- A damn good life!

658
01:05:20,036 --> 01:05:23,637
- Well, that's fine.
- A damn good, really good life!

659
01:05:23,737 --> 01:05:25,137
- Well, so have I!
- Yeah?

660
01:05:25,237 --> 01:05:27,137
You still leaving
a trail of human wreckage,

661
01:05:27,237 --> 01:05:28,637
or have you retired?

662
01:05:28,737 --> 01:05:30,137
Why? You looking for a date?

663
01:05:30,237 --> 01:05:32,538
With anybody but you.

664
01:05:32,637 --> 01:05:36,137
So, Dr. Jones, you will help us?

665
01:05:36,237 --> 01:05:37,639
A simple "yes" will do.

666
01:05:37,739 --> 01:05:40,237
Oh, Marion, you had to go
and get yourself kidnapped.

667
01:05:40,338 --> 01:05:42,438
Not like you did any better.

668
01:05:44,139 --> 01:05:45,838
Same old, same old.

669
01:05:48,139 --> 01:05:50,239
Henry Jones, Jr.

670
01:05:51,940 --> 01:05:55,440
- Henry Jones, Jr...
- That's right, Ox. Listen to me.

671
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:58,539
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

672
01:05:58,639 --> 01:06:01,440
- "that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
- Palace of...

673
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:04,039
It's from Milton.
He's said it before. Why?

674
01:06:04,139 --> 01:06:06,641
Ox, you got to tell us
how to get to Akator

675
01:06:06,740 --> 01:06:08,141
or they're gonna kill Marion.

676
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:12,541
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears,
here in death's dream kingdom..."

677
01:06:12,641 --> 01:06:13,141
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

678
01:06:13,141 --> 01:06:15,141
Harold, they're gonna kill
Abner's little girl.

679
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,342
You got to tell us how to get there.
We need...

680
01:06:26,242 --> 01:06:27,943
Get me paper. Something to write with.

681
01:06:39,244 --> 01:06:41,844
Autowriting! I should have seen this.

682
01:06:45,945 --> 01:06:50,443
- Henry Jones, Jr.
- Right. That's right, Ox.

683
01:06:50,643 --> 01:06:55,045
Three times it drops. The way down.

684
01:06:55,545 --> 01:06:58,045
- Three times...
- Pictographs.

685
01:06:59,746 --> 01:07:01,246
Ideograms.

686
01:07:09,846 --> 01:07:11,445
Good, Ox. Good.

687
01:07:23,646 --> 01:07:25,246
Ox?

688
01:07:26,547 --> 01:07:28,347
It's me, Ox.

689
01:07:28,447 --> 01:07:33,949
It's Mutt, Ox. Hey, look at me.
Look at me. It's me.

690
01:07:35,648 --> 01:07:36,949
It's me.

691
01:07:40,347 --> 01:07:44,248
The wavy lines mean water, of course.
Closed eyes mean sleep.

692
01:07:44,349 --> 01:07:48,650
The sun with the arc over the sky
stands for time, duration.

693
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:51,349
The word "now" is "until."

694
01:07:51,449 --> 01:07:52,650
These two close together,

695
01:07:52,849 --> 01:07:56,150
the horizon and the snake,
mean one thought.

696
01:07:56,251 --> 01:07:58,250
The horizon stood for the world,

697
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:01,650
but it didn't mean the Earth.
It meant big, great.

698
01:08:03,951 --> 01:08:07,751
"The water sleeps
until the great snake."

699
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:10,851
These aren't just drawings,
they're directions. Get me a map!

700
01:08:15,251 --> 01:08:17,152
The great snake is the Amazon,
of course,

701
01:08:17,252 --> 01:08:20,252
but "sleep," what water sleeps?

702
01:08:24,353 --> 01:08:27,752
Here! Sono.
The Portuguese word for "sleep."

703
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:29,854
Yes, good. Exactly.

704
01:08:32,153 --> 01:08:35,953
He wants us
to follow this curve of the Sono

705
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:39,354
down to where it meets the Amazon
to the southeast.

706
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:41,253
After that, I'm not sure.

707
01:08:41,354 --> 01:08:45,755
Kingdom of dreams, tears and eyes...
I have no idea what he means.

708
01:08:45,854 --> 01:08:46,854
This could be the route, though.

709
01:08:46,954 --> 01:08:49,253
It's a completely unexplored part
of the canopy.

710
01:08:53,654 --> 01:08:55,755
Go, go, go, go, go! Come on!

711
01:09:02,355 --> 01:09:04,457
- Kid, what the hell are we doing, kid?
- They were going to kill us!

712
01:09:04,657 --> 01:09:06,855
- Well, maybe.
- Somebody had to do something!

713
01:09:06,956 --> 01:09:09,256
- Something else would have been good.
- At least I got a plan.

714
01:09:09,355 --> 01:09:12,657
This is intolerable.
Harold, for God's sake, keep up.

715
01:09:20,858 --> 01:09:21,858
Mom?

716
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,757
- Stay back!
- Stop! Stop! Stop! Don't move.

717
01:09:24,858 --> 01:09:26,457
Moving makes space,
space will make you sink.

718
01:09:26,557 --> 01:09:27,757
No, I think I can get out if I can just...

719
01:09:27,858 --> 01:09:29,457
Stop it!
You're pulling against a vacuum.

720
01:09:29,557 --> 01:09:31,359
It's like trying to lift a car.
Just stay calm.

721
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,559
Okay, I'm calm.

722
01:09:32,759 --> 01:09:33,958
- What is it? Quicksand?
- I'm calm.

723
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:36,059
- No, it's a dry sand pit.
- I'm sinking, but I'm calm.

724
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:38,159
Quicksand is a mix of sand,
mud and water.

725
01:09:38,260 --> 01:09:40,158
And depending on the viscosity,
it's not as dangerous

726
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:41,559
- as people sometimes think.
- For Pete's sake, Jones,

727
01:09:41,658 --> 01:09:43,158
we're not in school!

728
01:09:43,259 --> 01:09:46,159
Don't worry. There's nothing
to worry about unless there's a...

729
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:49,659
A void collapse.

730
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:53,560
I'll go get something to pull you out.

731
01:09:53,661 --> 01:09:55,461
Ox, don't just sit there.

732
01:09:55,560 --> 01:09:58,260
For God's sake, man, go get help!

733
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:01,261
- Help?
- Help!

734
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:02,860
Help?

735
01:10:02,961 --> 01:10:04,261
Help! Go!

736
01:10:07,362 --> 01:10:09,761
Mutt can be a little impetuous.

737
01:10:09,862 --> 01:10:11,862
It's not the worst quality in the world.

738
01:10:12,962 --> 01:10:15,862
Keep your arms above the surface.
When the kid comes back, grab on.

739
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:19,061
- Indy, he...
- He's a good kid, Marion.

740
01:10:19,162 --> 01:10:20,762
You should get off his back
about school.

741
01:10:20,863 --> 01:10:22,962
- Mutt, I mean...
- Not everybody's cut out for it.

742
01:10:23,063 --> 01:10:24,662
His name is Henry!

743
01:10:24,762 --> 01:10:26,264
Henry. Good name.

744
01:10:26,363 --> 01:10:27,863
He's your son.

745
01:10:29,963 --> 01:10:31,563
My son?

746
01:10:31,662 --> 01:10:33,463
Henry Jones the Third.

747
01:10:36,663 --> 01:10:40,564
Why the hell
didn't you make him finish school?

748
01:10:40,664 --> 01:10:43,265
- Mom, grab on! Grab it!
- Yeah.

749
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:44,664
I got it.

750
01:10:45,965 --> 01:10:49,064
Come on, Mom! Pull, pull, pull, pull!

751
01:10:49,164 --> 01:10:50,364
Pull!

752
01:10:53,364 --> 01:10:54,565
Grab on.

753
01:10:56,466 --> 01:10:59,166
- Grab it.
- Just grab it, Indy.

754
01:10:59,365 --> 01:11:00,867
It's a rat snake!

755
01:11:00,966 --> 01:11:02,867
- Rat snakes aren't that big.
- Well, this one is, all right?

756
01:11:02,966 --> 01:11:04,567
It's not even poisonous. Now grab on!

757
01:11:04,667 --> 01:11:07,166
- Go get something else.
- Like what?

758
01:11:07,265 --> 01:11:08,966
Like a rope or something.

759
01:11:09,067 --> 01:11:12,266
There's no Sears and Roebuck here!
Grab the snake!

760
01:11:14,768 --> 01:11:17,868
- Maybe I can touch the bottom.
- There's no bottom. Now grab it.

761
01:11:17,967 --> 01:11:19,967
No, I think I can feel it with my feet.

762
01:11:20,068 --> 01:11:22,668
- Grab the snake!
- Stop calling it that!

763
01:11:22,769 --> 01:11:24,368
It's a snake!
What do you want me to call it?

764
01:11:24,467 --> 01:11:26,368
- Say "rope."
- What?

765
01:11:26,467 --> 01:11:28,569
Say "grab the rope."

766
01:11:28,668 --> 01:11:31,168
- Grab the rope!
- Grab the rope!

767
01:11:31,269 --> 01:11:33,168
Hold tight. It's slimy.

768
01:11:34,069 --> 01:11:35,170
Pull!

769
01:11:41,569 --> 01:11:45,770
Get rid of that thing, will you, Son?

770
01:11:45,869 --> 01:11:47,470
Afraid of snakes.

771
01:11:49,070 --> 01:11:51,070
You are one crazy old man.

772
01:11:54,970 --> 01:11:58,371
Why do you have to do everything
the hard way, Jonesey?

773
01:12:02,270 --> 01:12:04,271
Good work, Ox. Thanks.

774
01:12:04,971 --> 01:12:06,072
Help.

775
01:12:39,774 --> 01:12:43,975
No. No, he was British.
My dad was an RAF pilot.

776
01:12:44,076 --> 01:12:46,376
He was a war hero,
not some schoolteacher!

777
01:12:46,475 --> 01:12:50,074
No, sweetheart.
Colin was your stepfather.

778
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,975
We started dating
when you were three months old.

779
01:12:52,076 --> 01:12:53,475
He was a good man.

780
01:12:53,576 --> 01:12:57,676
Wait, wait, wait. Colin?
As in Colin Williams? You...

781
01:12:58,976 --> 01:13:01,476
You married him? I introduced you!

782
01:13:01,577 --> 01:13:04,578
I think you gave up your vote
on who I married

783
01:13:04,778 --> 01:13:07,676
when you decided to break it off
a week before the wedding!

784
01:13:07,777 --> 01:13:10,077
I think we both knew, Marion,
it wasn't going to work.

785
01:13:10,176 --> 01:13:12,578
You didn't know that.
Why didn't you ever talk to me about it?

786
01:13:12,677 --> 01:13:14,578
Because we never had an argument
I won!

787
01:13:14,677 --> 01:13:16,377
It's not my fault if you can't keep up!

788
01:13:16,478 --> 01:13:17,677
I didn't want to hurt you!

789
01:13:17,778 --> 01:13:20,378
For love of God, shut the hell up!

790
01:13:20,479 --> 01:13:24,478
Didn't you ever wonder years ago
why Ox stopped talking to you?

791
01:13:24,578 --> 01:13:26,279
He hated that you ran away.

792
01:13:26,378 --> 01:13:27,779
Would you two just stop?

793
01:13:27,878 --> 01:13:31,378
Yeah, Marion, let's not let the kid see
mom and dad fight.

794
01:13:31,578 --> 01:13:33,680
- You're not my dad, okay?
- You bet I am.

795
01:13:33,779 --> 01:13:35,079
And I got news for you.

796
01:13:35,180 --> 01:13:37,180
You're gonna go back and finish school.

797
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,479
Really? What happened to,

798
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:39,980
"There's not a damn thing
wrong with it, kid,

799
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:41,380
"and don't let anybody else
tell you any different"?

800
01:13:41,479 --> 01:13:42,779
You don't remember saying that?

801
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,579
That was before I was your father!

802
01:13:44,680 --> 01:13:46,081
- You're not my father!
- Oh, yes, he is your father.

803
01:13:46,180 --> 01:13:47,680
You should have
told me about the kid, Marion.

804
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:48,980
I had a right to know.

805
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:50,780
You vanished after that.

806
01:13:50,881 --> 01:13:53,381
- I wrote.
- A year later!

807
01:13:53,481 --> 01:13:57,282
By then,
Mutt was born and I was married!

808
01:13:57,381 --> 01:13:59,081
Why are you bothering to tell me now?

809
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,582
Because I thought we were gonna die!

810
01:14:01,681 --> 01:14:02,881
Not yet!

811
01:14:17,382 --> 01:14:18,582
Got it?

812
01:14:23,083 --> 01:14:24,283
Oh, shit.

813
01:14:36,784 --> 01:14:39,385
I'm sure I wasn't the only one
to go on with my life.

814
01:14:39,484 --> 01:14:42,485
There must've been
plenty of women for you over the years.

815
01:14:42,586 --> 01:14:46,786
Yeah. There were a few,
but they all had the same problem.

816
01:14:46,886 --> 01:14:48,587
Yeah? What's that?

817
01:14:50,786 --> 01:14:52,586
They weren't you, honey.

818
01:15:16,988 --> 01:15:19,088
We got to get Oxley back,
get our hands on that skull

819
01:15:19,189 --> 01:15:22,390
and get to Akator before they do.
Grab the wheel.

820
01:15:34,090 --> 01:15:36,190
What's he gonna do now?

821
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:38,591
- I don't think he plans that far ahead.
- Yeah.

822
01:15:39,591 --> 01:15:42,689
- Scooch over, will you, Son?
- Don't call me "son." Don't.

823
01:15:43,091 --> 01:15:44,890
I think I'd cover my ears if I were you.

824
01:15:55,792 --> 01:15:57,193
Duck! Duck!

825
01:16:00,792 --> 01:16:02,192
Move, move!

826
01:16:04,693 --> 01:16:06,792
Pull up next to that duck.

827
01:16:15,792 --> 01:16:18,894
Henry Jones, Jr.

828
01:16:30,895 --> 01:16:32,296
Jones!

829
01:16:47,596 --> 01:16:49,296
Come on! Come on!

830
01:17:04,597 --> 01:17:05,899
Get down!

831
01:17:17,798 --> 01:17:20,699
Ox has got the skull.
Marion, take the wheel.

832
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:22,100
That's not fair. She drove the truck.

833
01:17:22,199 --> 01:17:25,198
Don't be a child.
Find something to fight with.

834
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:36,301
Jonesey!

835
01:17:49,601 --> 01:17:51,402
- Jonesey!
- Hi, Mac.

836
01:18:27,005 --> 01:18:30,105
- Indy. Indy! Indy!
- Shut up! Shut up!

837
01:18:30,206 --> 01:18:35,206
- You stupid son of a bitch! I'm CIA.
- CIA.

838
01:18:35,305 --> 01:18:38,905
I almost screamed it at you in the tent.
I said, "Just like Berlin."

839
01:18:39,006 --> 01:18:41,006
What were we in Berlin, mate?

840
01:18:41,105 --> 01:18:42,907
- Double agents!
- The skull!

841
01:18:43,006 --> 01:18:44,707
Throw me the skull!

842
01:18:46,907 --> 01:18:48,606
Throw me the skull!

843
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:11,109
Riposte.

844
01:19:11,109 --> 01:19:11,908
Riposte.

845
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:19,409
Get on your front foot. Riposte.

846
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:21,409
It's not a match, Mom.

847
01:19:47,311 --> 01:19:51,412
You fight like a young man,
eager to begin, quick to finish.

848
01:19:51,813 --> 01:19:53,313
Mutt, disengage!

849
01:20:32,817 --> 01:20:35,315
Hey! Hey, I got the skull!

850
01:20:35,416 --> 01:20:37,416
- Throw the bag! Throw it!
- Throw the bag!

851
01:20:38,216 --> 01:20:39,617
- Gun!
- Gun!

852
01:21:26,220 --> 01:21:29,520
What are you looking at, Daddy-o?
She's getting away!

853
01:22:27,926 --> 01:22:29,926
This is very dangerous.

854
01:22:57,929 --> 01:23:00,029
<i>Do svidanya, Dr. Jones.</i>

855
01:23:28,131 --> 01:23:29,631
Jones!

856
01:23:32,231 --> 01:23:33,431
Whoa.

857
01:23:34,431 --> 01:23:35,431
Whoa.

858
01:23:36,931 --> 01:23:38,032
Whoa!

859
01:23:43,132 --> 01:23:44,131
Turn!

860
01:24:16,336 --> 01:24:17,636
- Siafu.
- What?

861
01:24:17,735 --> 01:24:19,435
Big damn ants! Go!

862
01:24:33,136 --> 01:24:34,837
Run to the river!

863
01:24:55,139 --> 01:24:56,838
Get to the river!

864
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:08,041
Jump in! Come on! Come on!

865
01:25:13,739 --> 01:25:15,541
Mom, there's a cliff!

866
01:28:00,756 --> 01:28:03,154
- Jonesey, come on!
- Get in, Jones!

867
01:28:19,756 --> 01:28:21,957
- Mom, stop.
- Mom, slow down.

868
01:28:25,957 --> 01:28:27,157
- Honey, stop.
- Slow down, Mom.

869
01:28:27,256 --> 01:28:28,957
- You're gonna go off the cliff.
- That's the idea.

870
01:28:29,057 --> 01:28:31,557
- Bad idea. Give me the wheel.
- Trust me!

871
01:28:31,658 --> 01:28:33,057
Slow down!

872
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:04,360
- Don't ever do that again.
- Yes, dear.

873
01:29:15,461 --> 01:29:17,761
Three times it drops.

874
01:29:21,462 --> 01:29:23,962
Reverse. Put it in reverse! Full reverse!

875
01:29:24,063 --> 01:29:25,863
- I'm trying! I'm trying!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Mom!

876
01:29:47,163 --> 01:29:48,663
The way down.

877
01:29:50,564 --> 01:29:53,664
He means by land. He came by land.

878
01:29:56,265 --> 01:29:58,565
- Three times it drops?
- Three times it drops.

879
01:29:58,666 --> 01:29:59,966
What is he talking about?

880
01:30:00,065 --> 01:30:01,666
He means one!

881
01:30:04,466 --> 01:30:05,765
Two!

882
01:30:23,966 --> 01:30:25,268
Three.

883
01:30:59,171 --> 01:31:02,871
You okay? Babe? Let go.

884
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:05,871
"Through eyes that last I saw in tears."

885
01:31:07,971 --> 01:31:10,171
"The golden vision reappears!"

886
01:31:13,872 --> 01:31:15,872
Gold. I'm in.

887
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:20,573
Through eyes... Through eyes in tears.
We got to go through that waterfall!

888
01:31:22,672 --> 01:31:26,472
The skull has to be returned.
I'll do it. Nobody else has to come.

889
01:31:26,573 --> 01:31:28,672
Who cares?

890
01:31:28,773 --> 01:31:31,672
It's brought us nothing but trouble.

891
01:31:31,773 --> 01:31:34,173
Look what it did to him.

892
01:31:34,274 --> 01:31:37,474
- I have to return it.
- Why you?

893
01:31:37,573 --> 01:31:39,573
Because it told me to.

894
01:31:52,475 --> 01:31:56,775
- Ochre, iron oxide, charcoal.
- Oxy, stay with us.

895
01:31:56,876 --> 01:31:58,576
How old is this?

896
01:31:58,676 --> 01:32:01,777
Four or five thousand years.
Old as the pyramids.

897
01:32:02,476 --> 01:32:05,676
Look, sun worshippers,
like the Egyptians.

898
01:32:08,577 --> 01:32:11,777
This is fresh. These were just used.

899
01:32:25,778 --> 01:32:27,478
More worshippers.

900
01:32:27,578 --> 01:32:30,779
Yeah, but that's not
the sun they're worshipping.

901
01:32:36,979 --> 01:32:38,279
Someone came

902
01:32:41,578 --> 01:32:44,680
and taught the Ugha farming.

903
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,280
Irrigation.

904
01:33:00,680 --> 01:33:02,581
Ox, what is it?

905
01:33:19,382 --> 01:33:21,483
I think I understand, Ox.

906
01:33:24,083 --> 01:33:25,484
Someone came?

907
01:33:49,585 --> 01:33:51,085
Are they the same?

908
01:33:51,185 --> 01:33:52,985
There were more. Look.

909
01:33:56,886 --> 01:33:58,686
Thirteen in a circle.

910
01:34:06,087 --> 01:34:07,787
Show us the way, Ox.

911
01:34:56,591 --> 01:35:00,492
- Let's go. Go, go, go! Run! Run, go!
- Go!

912
01:35:31,094 --> 01:35:32,894
Indy!

913
01:35:32,993 --> 01:35:35,494
Jonesey!

914
01:35:35,595 --> 01:35:36,994
Oxley!

915
01:35:38,095 --> 01:35:41,095
You were here before.
How did you get past them?

916
01:35:52,796 --> 01:35:55,896
Come on, Mac. Come on!
Come on, Mac.

917
01:35:58,697 --> 01:35:59,697
Come on, come on, come on.

918
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:01,197
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

919
01:36:01,296 --> 01:36:02,898
- "that ope's the Palace of Eternity."
- Come on, Ox.

920
01:36:02,997 --> 01:36:04,096
You did good, Ox. You did good.

921
01:36:28,498 --> 01:36:31,600
City of gold. So where's all the gold?

922
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:34,800
Look at the state of this place.

923
01:36:34,899 --> 01:36:37,701
What a stupid legend.
What a waste of my time.

924
01:36:37,801 --> 01:36:42,600
Ox was here before,
but he couldn't get into the temple,

925
01:36:42,699 --> 01:36:46,501
so he took the skull back
to the cemetery, where he found it.

926
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:50,702
"To lay their just hands
on that Golden Key

927
01:36:50,801 --> 01:36:53,101
"that ope's the Palace of Eternity."

928
01:36:53,202 --> 01:36:55,701
Key that ope's the palace.

929
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,702
The obelisk. The obelisk is the key?

930
01:37:07,203 --> 01:37:09,502
What are you looking for, Ox?

931
01:37:11,804 --> 01:37:13,502
What are you doing?

932
01:37:18,404 --> 01:37:22,003
You figured this out in your cell,
didn't you, Professor?

933
01:37:23,003 --> 01:37:24,804
Excuse me, Professor.

934
01:37:39,905 --> 01:37:41,206
Well done.

935
01:37:42,405 --> 01:37:44,105
Go get your own.

936
01:38:43,310 --> 01:38:44,711
Listen.

937
01:38:46,211 --> 01:38:47,612
Hear that?

938
01:38:50,112 --> 01:38:52,212
Get up! Move! Ox, move!

939
01:38:56,212 --> 01:38:58,912
Faster! Faster!

940
01:38:59,011 --> 01:39:01,212
Faster! Faster!

941
01:39:01,311 --> 01:39:02,912
Faster!

942
01:39:03,012 --> 01:39:05,313
This is not good. Move, Ox! Move!

943
01:39:06,012 --> 01:39:07,712
Quick! Quick! Quick!

944
01:39:10,213 --> 01:39:12,814
I don't like this! I don't like it!

945
01:39:12,913 --> 01:39:14,912
- Mom, come on!
- Jonesey!

946
01:39:32,215 --> 01:39:34,515
He dropped it. He dropped the skull!

947
01:39:34,614 --> 01:39:35,815
Okay?

948
01:39:46,216 --> 01:39:47,516
Hold this.

949
01:39:51,016 --> 01:39:52,617
Ox, you okay?

950
01:39:56,518 --> 01:39:57,618
Lovely.

951
01:39:58,818 --> 01:40:00,717
All right, let's go.

952
01:40:07,717 --> 01:40:09,018
This way?

953
01:41:16,123 --> 01:41:18,123
Now that's more like it.

954
01:41:24,225 --> 01:41:28,126
There are artifacts
from every era of early history.

955
01:41:28,225 --> 01:41:30,326
Macedonian.

956
01:41:30,525 --> 01:41:33,025
- Sumerian.
- This place is the mother lode.

957
01:41:33,126 --> 01:41:35,126
Etruscan. Babylonian.

958
01:41:35,225 --> 01:41:39,326
There isn't a museum in the world
that wouldn't sell its soul for this lot.

959
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:40,527
Early Egyptian.

960
01:41:40,627 --> 01:41:43,527
Dozens of museums.
Hundreds of them, Jonesey!

961
01:41:44,426 --> 01:41:45,726
Collectors.

962
01:41:48,328 --> 01:41:50,226
They were archeologists.

963
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:29,530
How do we open it?

964
01:42:35,131 --> 01:42:38,332
I'll give it back, Ox. I promise.

965
01:43:57,639 --> 01:44:00,238
No more forever waiting.

966
01:44:01,639 --> 01:44:03,238
Soon now.

967
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:15,039
Sorry, Jonesey.

968
01:44:15,140 --> 01:44:17,739
So what are you, a triple agent?

969
01:44:17,840 --> 01:44:21,140
Nah, I just lied about being a double.

970
01:44:26,541 --> 01:44:28,240
Look at them!

971
01:44:30,341 --> 01:44:35,042
Still waiting for the return
of the one who was lost.

972
01:44:39,342 --> 01:44:41,242
They are a hive mind.

973
01:44:43,242 --> 01:44:47,943
One being physically separate,
but with a collective consciousness.

974
01:44:49,743 --> 01:44:52,944
More powerful together
than they can ever be apart.

975
01:45:01,944 --> 01:45:04,543
Imagine what they could tell us.

976
01:45:04,644 --> 01:45:06,344
I can't imagine.

977
01:45:06,444 --> 01:45:07,944
Neither could the humans
that built this temple,

978
01:45:08,045 --> 01:45:09,145
and neither can you.

979
01:45:09,244 --> 01:45:12,744
Belief, Dr. Jones,
is a gift you have yet to receive.

980
01:45:14,345 --> 01:45:15,845
My sympathies.

981
01:45:15,944 --> 01:45:19,545
Oh, I believe, sister.
That's why I'm down here.

982
01:45:54,347 --> 01:45:57,649
- Mayan. He's speaking Mayan.
- What does he say?

983
01:45:57,748 --> 01:46:00,349
He says he's grateful and he wants...

984
01:46:02,550 --> 01:46:03,649
It.

985
01:46:06,948 --> 01:46:10,750
It wants to give us a gift.

986
01:46:13,649 --> 01:46:15,451
A big gift.

987
01:46:16,751 --> 01:46:18,850
Tell me everything you know.

988
01:46:22,952 --> 01:46:25,850
I want to know everything.
I want to know.

989
01:46:34,051 --> 01:46:36,453
I've got a bad feeling about this.

990
01:46:41,152 --> 01:46:42,452
Indy?

991
01:46:43,353 --> 01:46:44,653
The eyes.

992
01:47:49,259 --> 01:47:50,957
What are they? Spacemen?

993
01:47:51,457 --> 01:47:54,759
Interdimensional beings, in point of fact.

994
01:47:54,859 --> 01:47:56,658
Welcome back, Ox.

995
01:48:08,159 --> 01:48:09,760
What the hell is that?

996
01:48:09,859 --> 01:48:13,161
A portal!
A pathway to another dimension!

997
01:48:14,161 --> 01:48:16,761
I don't think we want to go that way.

998
01:48:32,362 --> 01:48:33,962
I want to know.

999
01:48:34,962 --> 01:48:36,363
I want to know.

1000
01:48:37,863 --> 01:48:41,463
Tell me. I'm ready. I want to know.

1001
01:48:47,764 --> 01:48:51,064
Mac! Mac! Come on!

1002
01:48:52,863 --> 01:48:53,965
Mac!

1003
01:48:56,465 --> 01:48:58,164
Mac, damn it, now!

1004
01:49:11,065 --> 01:49:12,466
I can see.

1005
01:49:14,365 --> 01:49:15,667
I can see!

1006
01:49:18,765 --> 01:49:19,966
Grab it!

1007
01:49:24,867 --> 01:49:27,667
Use your legs, Mac. I can't do it alone.

1008
01:49:29,568 --> 01:49:30,967
Jonesey!

1009
01:49:32,467 --> 01:49:34,466
I'm going to be all right.

1010
01:49:43,168 --> 01:49:44,368
No more!

1011
01:49:47,868 --> 01:49:50,069
Cover it. Cover it.

1012
01:50:03,470 --> 01:50:04,570
Go!

1013
01:50:04,671 --> 01:50:06,371
Enough!

1014
01:50:06,871 --> 01:50:08,670
Enough!

1015
01:50:21,471 --> 01:50:22,971
Go! Go!

1016
01:52:43,283 --> 01:52:45,684
Like a broom to their footprints.

1017
01:52:48,385 --> 01:52:51,784
Where did they go? Space?

1018
01:52:52,585 --> 01:52:57,786
Not into space.
Into the space between spaces.

1019
01:53:06,586 --> 01:53:08,386
I don't understand.

1020
01:53:09,987 --> 01:53:12,886
Why this legend of a city of gold?

1021
01:53:12,987 --> 01:53:16,087
The Ugha word for gold
translates as "treasure."

1022
01:53:17,188 --> 01:53:20,287
But their treasure wasn't gold.
It was knowledge.

1023
01:53:21,186 --> 01:53:23,287
Knowledge was their treasure.

1024
01:53:39,088 --> 01:53:41,389
What? We're just going to sit here?

1025
01:53:41,488 --> 01:53:43,090
Night falls quick in the jungle, kid.

1026
01:53:43,189 --> 01:53:45,090
You don't want to
climb down the mountain in the dark.

1027
01:53:45,189 --> 01:53:46,390
No?

1028
01:53:47,689 --> 01:53:51,190
I can. Who's coming with me?
Come on.

1029
01:53:51,291 --> 01:53:53,789
Why don't you stick around, Junior?

1030
01:53:56,289 --> 01:53:59,190
I don't know. Why didn't you, Dad?

1031
01:54:01,390 --> 01:54:02,791
Dad!

1032
01:54:06,492 --> 01:54:07,692
Dad?

1033
01:54:12,792 --> 01:54:15,292
Somewhere your grandpa is laughing.

1034
01:54:31,993 --> 01:54:35,694
Marvelous! Perfect!
Make the letters bigger, much bigger.

1035
01:54:48,494 --> 01:54:52,195
Henry Jones, Jr.,
and Marion Ravenwood,

1036
01:54:52,296 --> 01:54:57,296
insomuch in that you two have agreed
to live together in holy matrimony,

1037
01:54:57,395 --> 01:55:00,595
have promised your love for each other
by these vows

1038
01:55:00,695 --> 01:55:03,996
the joining of your hands
and the giving of these rings,

1039
01:55:04,095 --> 01:55:06,997
I now declare you
to be husband and wife.

1040
01:55:07,896 --> 01:55:12,596
Whom God hath put together,
let no one tear asunder.

1041
01:55:12,698 --> 01:55:15,597
"How much of human life
is lost in waiting!"

1042
01:55:16,797 --> 01:55:18,296
Congratulations.

1043
01:55:19,096 --> 01:55:21,198
You may kiss your bride.

1044
01:55:41,800 --> 01:55:43,500
Well done, Henry!
