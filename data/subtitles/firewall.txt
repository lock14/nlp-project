0
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:05,025
Where's my blue bag?

1
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:14,195
I don't care. No.

2
00:01:26,952 --> 00:01:28,977
-Pim, do you have him?
-I got him.

3
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:30,678
He's leaving the house.

4
00:01:30,856 --> 00:01:32,721
He's late today.

5
00:01:40,565 --> 00:01:43,932
-Where are you? Are you right there?
-No, I'm across the street.

6
00:01:51,677 --> 00:01:54,202
-Get closer than that.
-<i>I'm not gonna lose him.</i>

7
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:57,780
-<i>I'm not gonna lose him.</i>
-Pay attention, guys.

8
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:07,017
9:01 , down Granville Park. Again.

9
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:12,158
Okay, switch to channel seven.

10
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:24,973
Sarah!

11
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:27,539
Hi.

12
00:02:49,267 --> 00:02:51,098
Control the flow of traffic.

13
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:55,371
Come on! Come here, Rusty!

14
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:04,981
Rusty. Rusty, come here.

15
00:03:05,717 --> 00:03:07,514
Come-- Rusty!

16
00:03:08,153 --> 00:03:09,745
Come on, boy.

17
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:12,050
Come on. We're gonna be late.

18
00:03:12,224 --> 00:03:14,749
Hello, Jack.

19
00:03:16,328 --> 00:03:19,263
-Sarah, could you turn it down, please?
-What?

20
00:03:19,431 --> 00:03:22,423
The music, if that's what it is.
Turn it down.

21
00:03:22,601 --> 00:03:24,535
-Why?
-Has anyone let the dog out yet?

22
00:03:24,803 --> 00:03:28,534
-It's Sarah's turn! I did it last time!
-It takes, what, two seconds?

23
00:03:28,707 --> 00:03:30,732
Rusty, no! Leave it alone!

24
00:03:30,909 --> 00:03:32,536
Come on!

25
00:03:33,745 --> 00:03:35,337
Andy, stop it.

26
00:03:35,514 --> 00:03:39,814
Andy! Mom, tell Andy to get that thing
out of here. It's screwing up the TV.

27
00:03:40,352 --> 00:03:41,876
Idiot.

28
00:03:42,053 --> 00:03:44,647
Andy, a little help here, okay?

29
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:46,950
-Moron.
-Idiot moron.

30
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,389
-Moron idiot.
-Nobody's an idiot.

31
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:51,654
-Except for her.
-Nobody's a moron.

32
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:54,924
-Except for her.
-Andy, stop it!

33
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,364
I'm trying to watch this.

34
00:03:57,536 --> 00:03:59,561
Those two home together all week?

35
00:03:59,738 --> 00:04:03,333
-There's no school till Monday.
-Oh, boy. What's your day like?

36
00:04:03,508 --> 00:04:07,069
Finish the details on the Morgan house.
They're pouring the footings today.

37
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:11,074
Then I have to find a guitar teacher
for Sarah, pay some bills...

38
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:12,614
...and schlepping the kids.

39
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:16,550
You should get yourself a hobby,
keep yourself busy.

40
00:04:16,721 --> 00:04:18,848
-I already have a hobby.
-Yeah?

41
00:04:19,024 --> 00:04:21,652
And it's taking care of you.

42
00:04:21,827 --> 00:04:23,795
I don't deserve you.

43
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:25,224
No, you don't.

44
00:04:25,397 --> 00:04:28,195
We owe Arlin and Vee a dinner.
Wanna do it this week?

45
00:04:28,366 --> 00:04:31,529
Well, they're home this week.
I just wanna be with the kids.

46
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:35,799
-Mom! Tell Andy to get that thing out!
-Really?

47
00:04:36,775 --> 00:04:39,608
You should have Marci drop
my blue suit off at the cleaners.

48
00:04:39,778 --> 00:04:41,837
Marci's in Manila till the 26th.

49
00:04:42,013 --> 00:04:44,846
Here, sport, give me this for a second.

50
00:04:45,417 --> 00:04:49,046
-Mom! Excuse me, does anybody care?
-This is what's doing it.

51
00:04:49,221 --> 00:04:52,054
Put this in my office.
I'll show you how we can fix it.

52
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:55,455
Okay? And, yes, I do care.

53
00:04:57,095 --> 00:04:59,928
-Goodbye.
-Bye, Jack.

54
00:05:00,098 --> 00:05:02,191
-Bye, Dad.
-Bye, Andy.

55
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:05,461
Don't torture your sister.

56
00:05:05,637 --> 00:05:10,540
Sarah, this dog needs to go out.
Don't forget his new collar.

57
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,371
-Sarah.
-Bye, Jack.

58
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:23,146
--<i>getting a welcome break in the weather</i>
<i>before getting hit by a couple of storms.</i>

59
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:25,346
<i>That'll make the drive more difficult.</i>

60
00:05:25,524 --> 00:05:28,982
<i>Looks like smooth sailing this morning</i>
<i>heading into downtown Seattle.</i>

61
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:33,859
<i>We've been seeing slowdowns and</i>
<i>heavy traffic just about everywhere else....</i>

62
00:05:58,823 --> 00:06:01,121
-Morning.
-Morning, Richard.

63
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:04,820
-Morning, Cindy. How are you?
-Morning, Jack. Great, thanks.

64
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:07,864
How do I say this, Bobby?

65
00:06:08,033 --> 00:06:10,593
-No.
-Come on, Janet. I don't see why not.

66
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:13,966
Look, Bobby, here's how this works.
You ask me out, which you did.

67
00:06:14,139 --> 00:06:15,629
I say no, which I did.

68
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,935
You say, "Okay," and ask somebody else.
You don't keep asking me.

69
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,271
At what point does it become
sexual harassment?

70
00:06:21,446 --> 00:06:22,708
Right about now, Bobby.

71
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,781
-Mr. Stanfield.
-Morning, boss.

72
00:06:25,483 --> 00:06:27,974
-Kid's persistent.
-I don't know why.

73
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:30,815
-The usual reason, I suppose.
-Have you seen Ravi yet?

74
00:06:30,989 --> 00:06:32,786
No, I'm on my way now, though.

75
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:34,482
Don't forget, merger meeting.

76
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:38,661
-Nice flowers.
-Born-again Bobby.

77
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,493
-Maybe he's trying to save your soul.
-He'd need bigger blossoms than that.

78
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,571
-Good morning, Betty.
-Morning.

79
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:58,272
-How we doing?
-Pike Street system's running slow.

80
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:01,248
I'll tell Carol when she gets in.
We'll get after it.

81
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:04,582
Merger goes through, we'll go in
and replace the whole thing.

82
00:07:04,756 --> 00:07:06,223
Yeah.

83
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:10,153
-Morning, sir.
-Good morning, Rick.

84
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,525
Hey, Ravi. What have we got?

85
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,129
Brute-force login.
The interesting thing is...

86
00:07:17,302 --> 00:07:19,998
...he's coming in through Hong Kong,
Korea and Malaysia...

87
00:07:20,171 --> 00:07:23,368
...but he's trying sequential account
numbers. He's hacking all over.

88
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,236
Move over for me.

89
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:31,078
Let's try a rule change on him,
see what he does.

90
00:07:31,249 --> 00:07:34,741
Put in an IPS signature
that black-holes the pattern.

91
00:07:35,854 --> 00:07:39,415
-See if that slows him down.
-That'd slow me down.

92
00:07:39,591 --> 00:07:42,890
-That'd be resistant to false positives too.
-Yep.

93
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:44,722
Thanks.

94
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:49,723
Loss is higher than one would expect,
considering your level of security.

95
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:51,368
Just write it off?

96
00:07:51,536 --> 00:07:53,561
That depends on how
you view the statistics.

97
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:57,037
They're not particularly high,
given the fact that...

98
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:01,577
...we're pushing the business into
some new and uncharted areas.

99
00:08:01,746 --> 00:08:04,214
Online banking is where
the business is heading.

100
00:08:04,382 --> 00:08:05,713
Where we have our branches...

101
00:08:05,884 --> 00:08:09,445
...we'll provide our customers with
more ways to control their money.

102
00:08:09,621 --> 00:08:11,816
As you can see by the chart,
after the merger...

103
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,686
...Accuwest will have 1 1 00 branches
in 1 3 states...

104
00:08:14,859 --> 00:08:18,260
...with over 1 00 billion in assets.
So to answer you, Harry, yes...

105
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:23,390
...we do see a reasonable level of fraud loss
as a cost of doing business.

106
00:08:23,568 --> 00:08:26,298
-How many branches do you have?
-Twenty-seven.

107
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:28,866
As head of network security, Jack...

108
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,373
...you've never really had to think
in terms of economies of scale.

109
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:36,674
-But your philosophy of risk is--
-Wait a second, Gary.

110
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:41,342
Make this clear for me, will you?
What exactly is my philosophy of risk?

111
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,682
-No need to take this personally.
-I take it personally, goddamn it.

112
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:48,314
I've spent 20 years protecting this bank,
its customers and shareholders...

113
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:49,960
...from unnecessary risk.

114
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:53,394
Jack, I don't think you're hearing
what I'm saying.

115
00:08:53,565 --> 00:08:56,193
I hear what you're saying.
Fraud loss is inevitable...

116
00:08:56,367 --> 00:08:59,803
...pass it on to the customers
as the cost of doing business.

117
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,632
We don't wanna do that, do we?

118
00:09:03,908 --> 00:09:06,843
We're all here to serve the customers.
Let's try and get along.

119
00:09:07,011 --> 00:09:10,674
-We can have the best of both worlds.
-Doesn't exist, Arlin.

120
00:09:11,983 --> 00:09:15,009
Look, I'm sorry. This went on
a little longer than I anticipated.

121
00:09:15,186 --> 00:09:18,019
There's stuff I really have to get to.

122
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:23,521
-Okay, let's get on with it.
-Network attacks...

123
00:09:24,429 --> 00:09:25,691
...network activity.

124
00:09:29,434 --> 00:09:31,493
-Where is this guy?
-He's in reception.

125
00:09:31,669 --> 00:09:33,967
He said it's personal. Should I get him?

126
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,039
No, I'll walk over there.

127
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:42,811
Mr. Stanfield, Mr. Hughes.

128
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,877
Jack Stanfield, Mr. Hughes.

129
00:09:47,051 --> 00:09:48,678
-Do I know you?
-I know you.

130
00:09:49,554 --> 00:09:51,749
-Do you have a card?
-Oh, yeah.

131
00:09:54,659 --> 00:09:57,184
DHD Financial. What can I do for you?

132
00:09:57,362 --> 00:09:59,227
You can give me
the $95,000 you owe me.

133
00:09:59,864 --> 00:10:02,059
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-No?

134
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:04,997
I'm collecting for GambleNet U.S.A.
Does that ring a bell?

135
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:08,901
-No, it doesn't.
-You racked up 95 grand in online wagers.

136
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:11,507
And I got the paperwork to prove it.

137
00:10:11,676 --> 00:10:14,076
You got the wrong Jack Stanfield.
I don't gamble.

138
00:10:14,245 --> 00:10:18,011
-I don't have any debt. Check your facts.
-You're a deadbeat. See you in court.

139
00:10:18,183 --> 00:10:20,879
-Laurie, call security.
-Don't bother, sweetheart.

140
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:25,352
Gambling's an addiction, Mr. Stanfield.
Get some help.

141
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:46,877
Well, I thought the idea was
to match it to the curtains.

142
00:10:47,045 --> 00:10:49,673
-Yes, but if you do that....
-Nice flowers.

143
00:10:49,848 --> 00:10:51,179
Bobby?

144
00:10:51,349 --> 00:10:54,011
That would be the wrong thing to do,
don't you think?

145
00:10:54,886 --> 00:10:58,117
-What's up, partner?
-Take a look at this.

146
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:03,283
Who were you betting on?

147
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:05,122
I wasn't betting. I don't gamble.

148
00:11:05,296 --> 00:11:08,026
-I don't even know how.
-Well, that's obvious.

149
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:11,828
You think somebody got my information off
the bank's internal network or what?

150
00:11:12,003 --> 00:11:13,971
Are you doubting yourself
in your old age?

151
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:16,732
No. More likely a dumpster diver...

152
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:19,502
-...somebody sifting through your trash.
-Maybe.

153
00:11:20,578 --> 00:11:23,411
A debt collector showed up
this morning about it.

154
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:25,310
Don't worry. I'll clean it up.

155
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,951
It's just a pain in the ass.

156
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:29,984
Bill Cox? Guy from Atlanta.

157
00:11:30,154 --> 00:11:32,088
-Supposed to have a drink.
-I can do 5:30.

158
00:11:32,257 --> 00:11:34,020
I wanna get home early, pizza night.

159
00:11:34,192 --> 00:11:36,387
-Good. I'll let him know.
-Okay.

160
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,561
-Hey, you.
-<i>Hi, hon.</i>

161
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:47,000
Harry and I need to see a guy
for a few minutes after work.

162
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:49,196
-<i>Okay if I'm late?</i>
-What are you thinking?

163
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:52,172
<i>I don't know, 45 minutes, tops.</i>

164
00:11:52,343 --> 00:11:54,573
We'll see you when we see you.
Love you.

165
00:11:54,746 --> 00:11:56,941
<i>Love you too. Bye.</i>

166
00:12:02,053 --> 00:12:04,749
I see him. My question is this:

167
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:08,859
Do we really wanna work
for those Accuwest morons?

168
00:12:09,027 --> 00:12:12,121
-I'll listen to what he has to say.
-This guy could be our future.

169
00:12:12,297 --> 00:12:14,322
Okay, okay.

170
00:12:14,499 --> 00:12:16,558
-Bill.
-Good to see you, Harry.

171
00:12:17,001 --> 00:12:19,333
-Bill Cox, Jack Stanfield.
-How are you?

172
00:12:19,504 --> 00:12:22,166
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Please, sit.

173
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,773
Thank you.

174
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:35,315
Sarah, the pizza's here.
My wallet's by the door.

175
00:12:40,491 --> 00:12:42,925
Is somebody gonna get that?

176
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,457
-Here you go.
-So listen...

177
00:12:47,665 --> 00:12:50,793
...I don't know how much Harry's told you
about what I do.

178
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:54,302
Not a lot. Just that you're in banking.

179
00:12:54,472 --> 00:12:57,407
I have a company that provides
banking-support services...

180
00:12:57,575 --> 00:13:00,908
...mainly in the South, but, really,
I'm an old-fashioned entrepreneur.

181
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:07,945
If that's a scary movie, turn it off.
Your brother won't sleep for a week.

182
00:13:10,054 --> 00:13:12,318
-I'm so sorry to make you--
-Hello.

183
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:17,761
-Sarah!
-Mom.

184
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,021
Call 91 1 !

185
00:13:19,197 --> 00:13:22,030
There's over 200 regional banks
in the U.S. alone...

186
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,603
...that have nothing like the sophistication
of the system you developed for Landrock.

187
00:13:27,472 --> 00:13:29,963
Sarah! Leave her alone!

188
00:13:31,242 --> 00:13:33,403
With your system's software...

189
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:36,741
...Harry's expertise in law enforcement
and the physical security...

190
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,438
...you're an unbeatable team.

191
00:13:39,117 --> 00:13:40,880
Hey! Come here!

192
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:42,280
No!

193
00:13:42,453 --> 00:13:45,251
-What are you doing to me? Get away!
-Shut up!

194
00:13:45,423 --> 00:13:47,050
You'd be your own bosses.

195
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,386
I'd just supply the money.

196
00:13:50,661 --> 00:13:52,959
-Don't hurt my children.
-Shut up!

197
00:13:53,131 --> 00:13:55,361
Oh, my God, what do you want?

198
00:13:55,533 --> 00:13:57,967
I have to think about
a couple of other options...

199
00:13:58,136 --> 00:14:00,263
...but this sounds very attractive.

200
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:01,700
Okay, good.

201
00:14:04,308 --> 00:14:05,605
I hate to break this up.

202
00:14:05,777 --> 00:14:07,438
-I gotta get home.
-Family man.

203
00:14:07,612 --> 00:14:10,479
No! Daddy!

204
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:14,145
So how many kids do you have?

205
00:14:14,318 --> 00:14:17,583
Two. Boy, 8. Girl, 1 4.

206
00:14:17,755 --> 00:14:20,553
-Sure you don't need a ride?
-No, thanks, Harry. I'm fine.

207
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:21,987
Going back tonight?

208
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,792
-No, I've got some business here in town.
-Well, great meeting you. Take care.

209
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:45,039
She has beautiful eyes, your daughter.

210
00:14:45,783 --> 00:14:47,375
What?

211
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,220
Jesus, what--?

212
00:14:51,923 --> 00:14:53,481
Oh, my God. What do you want?

213
00:14:53,991 --> 00:14:56,551
I wanna get you home. It's pizza night.

214
00:14:58,763 --> 00:15:00,230
Drive.

215
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:02,560
Drive.

216
00:15:20,084 --> 00:15:23,053
Liam, we're on our way.
Everything all right?

217
00:15:23,221 --> 00:15:27,214
Fine, the house is secure.
And we're setting up now.

218
00:15:27,391 --> 00:15:29,757
I wanna talk to my wife.

219
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:32,259
You hear that, Liam?
He wants to talk to his wife.

220
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,398
They can't talk right now.

221
00:15:35,933 --> 00:15:37,161
She's busy.

222
00:16:12,069 --> 00:16:13,627
Who are you?

223
00:16:13,804 --> 00:16:15,567
What's this about?

224
00:16:18,309 --> 00:16:20,436
What do you want from me?

225
00:16:40,731 --> 00:16:42,426
This is your exit, Jack.

226
00:17:17,268 --> 00:17:19,896
<i>Three defenders had the chance</i>
<i>to put him on the ground.</i>

227
00:17:20,071 --> 00:17:21,436
They're here.

228
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:25,167
--<i>as good as he's been down the years.</i>
<i>Tremendous effort to stay alive.</i>

229
00:17:42,893 --> 00:17:45,225
-Where are they?
-Through here.

230
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,000
Jesus.

231
00:17:54,171 --> 00:17:56,332
-What is this?
-Daddy.

232
00:17:56,507 --> 00:17:58,975
Why have you done this, for God's sake?

233
00:17:59,844 --> 00:18:02,074
It's okay. They're children!

234
00:18:03,114 --> 00:18:05,514
I said, "If they were trouble."
Were they trouble?

235
00:18:05,683 --> 00:18:09,084
-They were noisy.
-Yes, we made an executive decision.

236
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:11,551
But you're a criminal, Willy,
not an executive.

237
00:18:11,722 --> 00:18:13,349
-But I thought you said--
-Shut up.

238
00:18:13,524 --> 00:18:16,049
-Daddy.
-I wanna know what you want...

239
00:18:16,227 --> 00:18:17,489
...and I wanna know now.

240
00:18:18,562 --> 00:18:19,790
Beth...

241
00:18:19,964 --> 00:18:23,195
...l'm sorry about all of this.
I am, but, well....

242
00:18:25,136 --> 00:18:26,694
There we are.

243
00:18:27,204 --> 00:18:30,799
I need you to talk to your husband.
He listens to you.

244
00:18:31,742 --> 00:18:35,200
I need you to make him understand that
if he doesn't do exactly as I ask...

245
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:38,212
...I will kill you and your two children.

246
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,917
But if you can make him listen, Beth...

247
00:18:42,586 --> 00:18:44,850
...if you can make him do what I want...

248
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:48,219
...you'll all walk away from
this unpleasantness unscathed.

249
00:18:48,693 --> 00:18:50,024
Not because I'm a nice man...

250
00:18:51,195 --> 00:18:55,097
...simply because there'll be no reason
for me to hurt you.

251
00:18:58,569 --> 00:18:59,797
Make sense?

252
00:19:03,074 --> 00:19:05,406
Can I rely on your cooperation?

253
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:08,411
-Just tell him yes.
-Yes.

254
00:19:09,547 --> 00:19:10,878
Sarah?

255
00:19:11,515 --> 00:19:13,278
Fine.

256
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:16,584
And you, big fella?

257
00:19:17,021 --> 00:19:18,784
Maybe.

258
00:19:18,956 --> 00:19:22,084
-Andy.
-No, it's all right. It's honest.

259
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:27,053
Do you keep a gun in the house, Jack?

260
00:19:28,299 --> 00:19:29,994
No.

261
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:33,798
-Daddy!
-I'm okay.

262
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:35,268
-It's okay.
-Don't worry.

263
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,498
-It's okay.
-I'm all right. I'm okay.

264
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:38,903
Pass me the gun.

265
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:41,310
It's empty.

266
00:19:45,249 --> 00:19:47,274
You lied to me, Jack.

267
00:19:48,886 --> 00:19:50,945
Don't let it happen again.

268
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,151
You have an excellent alarm system.

269
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,487
What are alarms for, Andy?

270
00:19:58,295 --> 00:20:01,128
-To keep people out.
-That's right.

271
00:20:01,832 --> 00:20:03,766
And they also keep people in.

272
00:20:04,802 --> 00:20:06,929
I'll need the password, Jack.

273
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:09,966
Lark.

274
00:20:12,276 --> 00:20:15,803
Lark. It's the name of our boat.

275
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,447
All right.

276
00:20:18,382 --> 00:20:19,644
Untie them.

277
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,717
Take it easy.

278
00:20:29,894 --> 00:20:31,725
Daddy.

279
00:20:31,896 --> 00:20:33,557
I'll be fine.

280
00:20:34,765 --> 00:20:38,462
Hi, this is Jack Stanfield,
account number 51 21 6.

281
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:42,299
I need to change our alarm code
and give you a new password.

282
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:47,302
I know it's difficult for you,
but try and get some sleep.

283
00:20:56,086 --> 00:20:57,883
Mom, what's going on?

284
00:20:58,055 --> 00:21:01,718
-What do they want?
-I don't know, sweetheart.

285
00:21:11,702 --> 00:21:13,966
Do you want something to eat, Jack?

286
00:21:19,076 --> 00:21:22,102
-I'm not hungry.
-No?

287
00:21:24,281 --> 00:21:26,772
Do you have any wine?

288
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:32,952
There's some in the bar.

289
00:21:35,526 --> 00:21:39,018
Pim, go and get me a nice bottle of red.

290
00:21:39,196 --> 00:21:42,597
I don't know shit about wine, man.
How do I know if it's nice?

291
00:21:42,766 --> 00:21:45,064
lt'll be dusty.

292
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:50,062
I didn't know he had a gun.

293
00:21:50,608 --> 00:21:52,701
They hit him so hard.

294
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:56,108
He'll be fine.

295
00:21:56,447 --> 00:21:59,075
It's just a little lump on the head.

296
00:22:01,819 --> 00:22:05,721
-Let's think about something nice, okay?
-Okay.

297
00:22:06,457 --> 00:22:08,049
I know.

298
00:22:10,427 --> 00:22:12,520
We're onboard the <i>Lark</i>.

299
00:22:13,731 --> 00:22:15,699
And the sail's up.

300
00:22:16,667 --> 00:22:18,692
And the sun is shining.

301
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:21,535
And it's warm.

302
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:25,404
And, Andy, you're at the wheel
with your dad.

303
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:32,408
Vel.

304
00:22:33,851 --> 00:22:35,148
Get Jack a blanket.

305
00:22:36,487 --> 00:22:38,819
He's got a busy day tomorrow.

306
00:23:17,394 --> 00:23:21,023
She's asleep. Get some yourself.

307
00:23:21,198 --> 00:23:24,565
-I'll wake you in an hour.
-Okay.

308
00:23:39,984 --> 00:23:42,111
<i>Let's take a look,</i>
<i>show you what's going on.</i>

309
00:23:42,286 --> 00:23:45,346
<i>Yeah, we do have a big storm,</i>
<i>big section of the country.</i>

310
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:47,490
<i>It's gonna bring a variety of weather....</i>

311
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:49,489
Morning, Jack.

312
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:53,154
Time to get ready for work.

313
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,731
<i>You can look for some snow by tomorrow</i>
<i>through the upper Great Lakes.</i>

314
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:02,562
You have to do whatever they want.
I don't care what it is.

315
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:06,073
It may not be that easy.
We've seen their faces.

316
00:24:06,243 --> 00:24:09,679
-But he said if we just cooperate--
-I know what they said, Beth.

317
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:15,618
<i>Did you ever notice</i>
<i>how big squirrels' teeth are?</i>

318
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,378
Where's Andy?

319
00:24:17,554 --> 00:24:19,283
Breakfast.

320
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:23,424
-Count to three.
-One, two, three.

321
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:25,929
Andy!

322
00:24:26,096 --> 00:24:27,620
Andy.

323
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,156
This man is not our friend. Stay away.

324
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,495
-But I want a pancake.
-Go see your mom.

325
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,900
-Want some Cheerios?
-No.

326
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:39,440
You're worried I'll give him
peanut oil, Jack.

327
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,734
I know about his allergy.

328
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:44,544
Don't imagine for one second...

329
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:47,912
...that I just blundered in here
out of the rain.

330
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:49,347
Don't touch him.

331
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,010
Don't talk to him.

332
00:24:51,188 --> 00:24:53,486
And don't feed him anything.

333
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:02,758
I'm fitting you with
two separate systems.

334
00:25:02,933 --> 00:25:04,764
Audio transmitter.

335
00:25:04,935 --> 00:25:07,631
We hear everything you do.

336
00:25:07,805 --> 00:25:11,104
-What do I do when I get to the office?
-You do your work, Jack.

337
00:25:11,642 --> 00:25:13,610
Chase that American dream.

338
00:25:14,712 --> 00:25:17,146
The video camera,
with a wide-angle lens.

339
00:25:18,248 --> 00:25:20,148
We see what you see.

340
00:25:20,551 --> 00:25:22,018
I've cloned your cell phone.

341
00:25:22,186 --> 00:25:25,678
Any call that you make or receive,
we can monitor.

342
00:25:26,356 --> 00:25:29,951
-What about my family?
-Oh, they'll be safe...

343
00:25:30,127 --> 00:25:31,685
...here with us.

344
00:25:32,463 --> 00:25:34,488
Now, tuck your shirt in and go to work.

345
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:46,799
-Bye, pal.
-Bye, Dad.

346
00:26:08,132 --> 00:26:09,360
You're a young man.

347
00:26:11,435 --> 00:26:13,801
You don't need to be doing this.

348
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:19,067
The longer it goes on...

349
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:20,733
...the deeper in you are.

350
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:24,347
Let's stop it right now,
before it gets worse.

351
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,945
Same to you, kid.

352
00:26:52,843 --> 00:26:54,071
<i>You're gonna love me.</i>

353
00:26:54,244 --> 00:26:58,681
-Those tickets I couldn't get? I got them.
-I need five minutes.

354
00:27:35,519 --> 00:27:39,956
<i>The Dow Jones Industrial Average</i>
<i>is up 1 6 points to 1 0,255...</i>

355
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:42,591
<i>...on a volume of 22 million shares.</i>

356
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:45,125
<i>The NASDAQ Composite</i>
<i>is up 1 1 points...</i>

357
00:27:45,295 --> 00:27:49,197
<i>...to 2,061 on a volume</i>
<i>of 1.6 million shares.</i>

358
00:28:30,974 --> 00:28:32,942
Can you hear me?

359
00:28:34,144 --> 00:28:35,771
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

360
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,008
<i>If you can hear me, tell your boss</i>
<i>I wanna speak to him.</i>

361
00:28:40,183 --> 00:28:44,085
Tell him to quit dicking me around
and tell me what he wants me to do.

362
00:28:44,254 --> 00:28:47,223
-Can you hear me?
-Jack? Are you okay?

363
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:51,151
Yes, I'm just talking to myself.
What's up?

364
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:53,195
Arlin wants to see you.

365
00:28:55,399 --> 00:28:56,991
Yeah.

366
00:29:07,377 --> 00:29:10,141
So you're an architect.

367
00:29:11,114 --> 00:29:12,479
Yes.

368
00:29:13,350 --> 00:29:15,682
And you designed this house.

369
00:29:16,954 --> 00:29:18,615
I did.

370
00:29:20,924 --> 00:29:22,619
It's nice.

371
00:29:25,062 --> 00:29:26,723
Thanks.

372
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:28,455
How old is it?

373
00:29:28,632 --> 00:29:30,065
Seven years.

374
00:29:30,233 --> 00:29:34,363
-How much does a house like this go for?
-This is about robbing the bank, isn't it?

375
00:29:34,538 --> 00:29:37,666
You're using Jack to help you
rob the bank.

376
00:29:38,075 --> 00:29:40,168
Open a few doors
and press a few buttons.

377
00:29:40,344 --> 00:29:42,073
Just look after the kids, Beth.

378
00:29:43,046 --> 00:29:45,981
And, Vel, stick to your work.

379
00:29:53,824 --> 00:29:55,655
I need you to try and get along.

380
00:29:55,826 --> 00:29:59,819
Arlin, I'm tired of him patronizing me.
Gary is an idiot.

381
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:02,022
Be that as it may, he's a fact of life...

382
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:05,760
...on top of which, you may be working
for him in a couple of weeks.

383
00:30:07,204 --> 00:30:09,570
Okay. I'll take care of it.

384
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,537
Jack. Are you okay?

385
00:30:11,708 --> 00:30:13,903
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

386
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:15,772
And Beth and the kids?

387
00:30:18,749 --> 00:30:20,239
They're fine, Arlin.

388
00:30:21,918 --> 00:30:24,682
Listen, Jack, Gary doesn't like you
very much...

389
00:30:24,855 --> 00:30:28,416
...and based on your performance yesterday,
it's not hard to understand.

390
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:31,857
Also, we had a debt collector here
yesterday asking questions.

391
00:30:32,029 --> 00:30:34,998
-What was that all about?
-Somebody compromised my identity...

392
00:30:35,165 --> 00:30:38,100
...and ran up $95,000 worth
of online gambling debt.

393
00:30:38,668 --> 00:30:40,602
Harry's taking care of it.

394
00:30:41,671 --> 00:30:43,036
You know me, l--

395
00:30:43,206 --> 00:30:46,198
I don't gamble. I don't have any debt.

396
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:47,604
Talk to Gary now.

397
00:30:47,778 --> 00:30:51,111
-I want this merger to go smoothly.
-I can't today, I'm--

398
00:30:51,281 --> 00:30:53,249
Today, Jack.

399
00:30:53,417 --> 00:30:56,477
Okay. I'll take care of it. Thanks.

400
00:30:57,054 --> 00:30:58,578
Are we on for dinner next week?

401
00:31:01,691 --> 00:31:03,784
Yeah, let me check with Beth.

402
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:09,460
Looks good. Get it out there.

403
00:31:14,638 --> 00:31:16,367
Gary?

404
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,667
Oh, yeah, Jack. Need something?

405
00:31:18,842 --> 00:31:21,276
Yeah, I just wanted to have a word.

406
00:31:21,445 --> 00:31:23,276
lf....

407
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:27,007
If I seemed like I was a little abrupt...

408
00:31:27,184 --> 00:31:29,846
...or difficult yesterday,
I wanna apologize.

409
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,353
I want you to know I am committed
to this process.

410
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:39,061
-Just having a bad day, that's all.
-Seem a little stressed. Everything okay?

411
00:31:39,229 --> 00:31:42,426
-Yeah. I'm just fine, Gary. Thank you.
-You sure?

412
00:31:44,701 --> 00:31:46,794
-Yeah.
-We can make this merger work...

413
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:48,835
...for everyone's benefit.

414
00:31:49,005 --> 00:31:53,066
I'm here to help. If you ever do have
a problem, my door is always open.

415
00:31:53,243 --> 00:31:54,540
Thank you, Gary.

416
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,986
Janet? Come in here
for a second, will you?

417
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:15,730
We'll do some letters.

418
00:32:21,505 --> 00:32:25,737
Janet, if I've been difficult or distant...

419
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,878
<i>...for the last couple of days,</i>
<i>I hope you'll understand.</i>

420
00:32:29,045 --> 00:32:30,512
-<i>I wanna apologize.</i>
-<i>That's okay.</i>

421
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,045
<i>We're a team, you and me.</i>

422
00:32:33,183 --> 00:32:38,382
And I want you to understand how much
I appreciate what you do for me.

423
00:32:38,555 --> 00:32:41,524
-Thanks, Jack.
-It means the world to me.

424
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,221
<i>Sometimes I think I just need to...</i>

425
00:32:48,031 --> 00:32:49,794
...relax.

426
00:32:49,966 --> 00:32:51,524
Okay.

427
00:32:51,701 --> 00:32:53,032
-Take a minute.
-Okay.

428
00:32:53,203 --> 00:32:55,535
Take five minutes out of the day...

429
00:32:55,705 --> 00:33:00,267
<i>...and just sit quietly and take a break.</i>

430
00:33:00,844 --> 00:33:04,541
-<i>You know, just....</i>
-<i>Sure. Jack</i>--<i>?</i>

431
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:13,581
He's lost it. Completely lost it.

432
00:33:13,757 --> 00:33:15,816
Letter to Scott Smith.

433
00:33:15,992 --> 00:33:19,359
Dear Scott, pursuant to your request...

434
00:33:19,563 --> 00:33:22,862
<i>...for further information regarding</i>
<i>the security-interface issues...</i>

435
00:33:23,033 --> 00:33:26,491
<i>...unfortunately, the information</i>
<i>that you requested is not available.</i>

436
00:33:26,670 --> 00:33:28,262
<i>Sorry for the inconvenience.</i>

437
00:33:28,438 --> 00:33:30,429
Until the merger--

438
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:33,508
Shit. Strike that.

439
00:33:33,677 --> 00:33:36,976
-Harry's in L.A. for a convention.
-Thanks for coming to tell me that.

440
00:33:37,147 --> 00:33:40,173
I can refer you to my associate,
Gary Mitchell...

441
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,251
...who may be able to provide you
with the information.

442
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,818
-Regards to the family, usual close.
-Jack?

443
00:33:46,456 --> 00:33:48,549
<i>Jack, I've been looking for you.</i>

444
00:33:48,725 --> 00:33:50,249
Shit.

445
00:33:50,427 --> 00:33:53,225
-<i>There's a Bill Redmond here to see you.</i>
-Shit!

446
00:33:53,396 --> 00:33:56,559
-<i>Who?</i>
-Redmond, from the Federal Banking Board?

447
00:33:56,733 --> 00:34:00,260
-What are you talking about, Federal--?
-Jack Stanfield?

448
00:34:01,271 --> 00:34:03,501
Bill Redmond. Pleased to meet you.

449
00:34:05,709 --> 00:34:08,177
Janet, close the door, please.

450
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:13,581
-Look--
-Oh, Jack, Jack, Jack.

451
00:34:15,352 --> 00:34:19,288
Liam, take the boy downstairs
and break his knee.

452
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:20,684
Don't do that.

453
00:34:20,857 --> 00:34:23,018
It's my fault, not his. It's my mistake.

454
00:34:23,193 --> 00:34:25,127
Don't take it out on the boy.

455
00:34:26,062 --> 00:34:27,552
Please.

456
00:34:27,731 --> 00:34:30,029
-Please don't.
-Liam?

457
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:31,667
<i>Let him go!</i>

458
00:34:32,235 --> 00:34:34,169
Leave him be for now.

459
00:34:39,276 --> 00:34:41,608
I'd like a tour of the bank now, Jack.

460
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:45,809
I'm sorry, I have a terrible memory.

461
00:34:45,982 --> 00:34:47,677
-What was your name?
-Janet Stone.

462
00:34:47,851 --> 00:34:49,443
-Janet, can I borrow a pen?
-Sure.

463
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:55,683
That one'll do. I just need to write them
down once, and then they stick.

464
00:34:55,859 --> 00:34:58,020
I didn't know about your meeting.
Who set it up?

465
00:34:58,194 --> 00:35:01,095
It was a last-minute thing, Janet.
I forgot to tell you.

466
00:35:01,264 --> 00:35:04,859
Now, I'm gonna give Mr. Redmond
a tour of the bank.

467
00:35:07,103 --> 00:35:10,664
-Thanks.
-I'll find you if I need you.

468
00:35:20,016 --> 00:35:22,007
-Good morning, Mr. Stanfield.
-Good morning.

469
00:35:22,185 --> 00:35:23,880
-I have a guest, Mr. Redmond.
-Hi.

470
00:35:24,054 --> 00:35:25,453
Hi.

471
00:35:30,894 --> 00:35:32,953
Open sesame.

472
00:35:44,808 --> 00:35:46,833
Mr. Stanfield.

473
00:35:48,712 --> 00:35:53,342
You'd think with so much plastic, there
wouldn't be any need for this real money.

474
00:36:04,661 --> 00:36:07,926
How long do they keep the images
from those cameras?

475
00:36:08,098 --> 00:36:10,089
Fifteen days.

476
00:36:20,944 --> 00:36:22,605
Thank you.

477
00:36:27,417 --> 00:36:30,318
How do you expect
to get in and out of here?

478
00:36:30,487 --> 00:36:32,182
I don't.

479
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:50,696
This is the real vault, isn't it, Jack?

480
00:36:50,874 --> 00:36:52,569
Binary code.

481
00:36:52,742 --> 00:36:54,403
Virtual money.

482
00:36:54,577 --> 00:36:58,604
Tell me, how can it be stealing
if you can't even touch it?

483
00:37:01,251 --> 00:37:04,880
That's it, huh? This is your plan?

484
00:37:05,054 --> 00:37:09,184
You think your schoolboy techie friend
can hack into these servers?

485
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:12,789
This is what you kidnapped
my family for?

486
00:37:12,962 --> 00:37:15,692
I don't need to hack into anything.

487
00:37:15,865 --> 00:37:18,197
We're already inside.

488
00:37:18,368 --> 00:37:20,199
All we need to do is plug in.

489
00:37:21,704 --> 00:37:24,229
You're gonna log on to
a maintenance terminal...

490
00:37:24,407 --> 00:37:29,367
...and run a prioritized search selecting the
accounts of your 1 0,000 richest customers.

491
00:37:29,546 --> 00:37:33,880
And then with the program on this,
you'll withdraw $ 1 0,000 from each...

492
00:37:34,517 --> 00:37:38,419
...and transfer the money
to my offshore accounts.

493
00:37:38,588 --> 00:37:41,421
A hundred million dollars.
Wow, that's a lot of money.

494
00:37:41,591 --> 00:37:44,890
-That's a good plan.
-Thanks, we like it.

495
00:37:45,061 --> 00:37:46,392
At least it was last week.

496
00:37:46,563 --> 00:37:51,330
Look around. Do you see any
maintenance terminals to plug into, huh?

497
00:37:51,501 --> 00:37:55,062
The bank that took us over
had them removed.

498
00:37:55,238 --> 00:38:00,232
There's nothing accessible from this room
anymore. Not from this building.

499
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:06,174
You're in the wrong town.
You should be in Wichita, Kansas, Bill.

500
00:38:09,652 --> 00:38:12,018
You designed the software...

501
00:38:13,223 --> 00:38:15,054
...you find me a way in.

502
00:38:15,225 --> 00:38:17,125
I wouldn't know where to start.

503
00:38:17,961 --> 00:38:21,522
Well, then you have
a big fucking problem.

504
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,933
-Looks like it's almost done.
-Yeah.

505
00:38:53,563 --> 00:38:55,030
Andy!

506
00:38:59,335 --> 00:39:00,563
Let him go.

507
00:39:01,704 --> 00:39:03,433
-Come on--
-Okay, okay.

508
00:39:03,606 --> 00:39:05,904
Answer the goddamn phone.

509
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:10,178
-Hello.
-<i>It's Tom.</i>

510
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:11,745
-Hi, Tom.
-<i>Something wrong?</i>

511
00:39:11,915 --> 00:39:15,078
No, everything's okay.
I just dropped a bottle of milk...

512
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:17,549
...and it's just made
a big mess everywhere.

513
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:22,350
-<i>Listen, I thought we'd stop by</i>--
-Thanks, but we're all down with the flu.

514
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:25,085
-<i>All right, well</i>--
-Okay. I gotta get back.

515
00:39:25,261 --> 00:39:27,252
-Thanks, Tom.
-<i>Okay.</i>

516
00:39:28,331 --> 00:39:29,628
-Mom.
-Come on.

517
00:39:30,199 --> 00:39:32,759
Are you all right? Okay, you're okay.

518
00:39:32,936 --> 00:39:35,803
Don't you ever touch my children again,
do you hear me?

519
00:39:35,972 --> 00:39:37,599
Shut your goddamn mouth.

520
00:39:37,774 --> 00:39:39,799
From now on, you do as you're told!

521
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:14,207
-Roll down the window!
-What?

522
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:16,607
-How much is he paying you?
-Get back in!

523
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:20,510
-Five million dollars to get my family out.
-Get in the car or I call Bill.

524
00:40:26,089 --> 00:40:28,523
There are traps in the system.
He's gonna get caught.

525
00:40:28,691 --> 00:40:30,784
You're all gonna get caught, Willy.

526
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,657
-Five million dollars, right now.
-In the car, I mean it!

527
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:36,428
Get back in the car.

528
00:40:54,384 --> 00:40:56,682
-What the hell happened, man?
-Nothing.

529
00:40:56,853 --> 00:40:59,981
Exactly. So, what's the plan?
How do we get the money?

530
00:41:00,156 --> 00:41:03,148
You are really beginning to bore me.

531
00:41:08,798 --> 00:41:12,063
I want you and your wife
downstairs now.

532
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:31,450
How was your day, Beth?

533
00:41:31,954 --> 00:41:33,922
Am I supposed to believe you care?

534
00:41:34,624 --> 00:41:37,593
Willy! Come down here!

535
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,923
Jack has broken our agreement
and decided not to cooperate.

536
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:43,229
Willy!

537
00:41:43,399 --> 00:41:44,627
What's he talking about?

538
00:41:44,801 --> 00:41:47,292
-It's just a game, honey.
-No, it's not a game.

539
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,734
Listen to your wife, Jack.

540
00:41:50,006 --> 00:41:52,839
-Hey.
-Sit down, Willy.

541
00:41:55,311 --> 00:41:57,245
So, Willy...

542
00:41:57,413 --> 00:42:00,678
...what happened today?
How did Jack manage to hand over the pen?

543
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:02,340
I'm not exactly sure.

544
00:42:02,518 --> 00:42:06,477
-I mean, everything seemed to be fine.
-Willy, I told you to watch him.

545
00:42:06,656 --> 00:42:08,954
Everything was cool.
And then all of a sudden--

546
00:42:09,125 --> 00:42:11,423
Listen, Willy...

547
00:42:11,594 --> 00:42:16,156
...how can I expect Jack to do
as he's told if you don't?

548
00:42:16,332 --> 00:42:17,993
Yeah, I don't know.

549
00:42:18,167 --> 00:42:20,897
-I made a mistake. Sorry.
-We all make mistakes, Willy.

550
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,096
-Just not as many as you.
-Yeah, yeah, I said I was sorry.

551
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,402
All right.

552
00:42:31,614 --> 00:42:32,842
Okay, you're sorry.

553
00:42:34,684 --> 00:42:35,946
Watch them.

554
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:42,819
God Almighty.

555
00:42:51,701 --> 00:42:53,464
Get out.

556
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:01,835
Oh, my God.

557
00:43:04,046 --> 00:43:05,638
-What happened?
-Clean this mess up.

558
00:43:05,815 --> 00:43:07,942
Shit! Liam, come here.

559
00:43:08,117 --> 00:43:09,345
-What?
-He shot him.

560
00:43:09,519 --> 00:43:11,953
Go through the basement.
Get the kids out of here.

561
00:43:12,121 --> 00:43:14,351
-Shut up, Vel.
-Don't tell me to shut up.

562
00:43:14,524 --> 00:43:16,958
Pretend to be watching television,
falling asleep.

563
00:43:17,126 --> 00:43:19,651
-Nine o'clock, I'll divert them.
-Sit down now!

564
00:43:19,829 --> 00:43:21,729
Beth, go to the bedroom.

565
00:43:22,398 --> 00:43:24,093
Jack, over there.

566
00:43:52,395 --> 00:43:54,522
Okay, honey.

567
00:43:56,032 --> 00:43:58,466
-Don't really go to sleep, okay?
-Okay.

568
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:01,398
Just pretend to be asleep.

569
00:44:02,338 --> 00:44:03,896
-Okay.
-Okay.

570
00:44:05,441 --> 00:44:08,171
This is all gonna be over really soon.

571
00:44:14,851 --> 00:44:16,614
What are you planning?

572
00:44:18,521 --> 00:44:20,955
How are you gonna get me my money?

573
00:44:26,863 --> 00:44:28,854
I don't know yet.

574
00:44:30,066 --> 00:44:31,966
I'm working on it.

575
00:44:32,501 --> 00:44:34,901
You've got 1 2 hours
till the bank opens, Jack.

576
00:45:16,112 --> 00:45:17,943
Shit.

577
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:19,741
Go. Get Daddy's flashlight.

578
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:28,184
Okay, go.

579
00:45:28,991 --> 00:45:32,825
-What's going on, Vel?
-It's fine. It's just some local interference.

580
00:45:33,529 --> 00:45:35,224
Go check on Jack.

581
00:45:47,977 --> 00:45:49,706
It's back.

582
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,647
Yeah, he's just sitting there.

583
00:46:03,392 --> 00:46:05,155
Pim!

584
00:46:05,795 --> 00:46:07,319
Vel, you stay here and watch.

585
00:46:23,746 --> 00:46:25,338
Okay, go, honey, go.

586
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:32,910
Wait, honey.

587
00:46:33,723 --> 00:46:36,453
-Mom.
-Let me go first, honey.

588
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:42,156
Pim, check the bedroom!
Vel, get these lights on now!

589
00:46:42,865 --> 00:46:45,857
Fast as you can. Fast as you can.
Andy, go.

590
00:46:50,506 --> 00:46:52,030
They're gone!

591
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:58,104
Liam, we need him.

592
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:03,713
They're not here!

593
00:47:08,324 --> 00:47:09,791
Hello!

594
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:12,723
Yes, this is Jack Stanfield.

595
00:47:16,198 --> 00:47:18,792
-You okay?
-Yeah.

596
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:22,460
I'm sorry. My son opened a door, and....

597
00:47:23,172 --> 00:47:24,400
Yeah, I know.

598
00:47:24,573 --> 00:47:27,064
Come on, honey, help me.
Ready? One, two....

599
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:31,841
They're in the garage!

600
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:35,313
Come here. Okay, go, go, honey.

601
00:47:48,864 --> 00:47:51,128
Get out of--!

602
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:52,892
Mom!

603
00:47:58,908 --> 00:48:00,705
Open the goddamn door now!

604
00:48:07,516 --> 00:48:09,211
Stop!

605
00:48:09,952 --> 00:48:11,317
Mom!

606
00:48:12,855 --> 00:48:15,221
-Andy!
-Get them in!

607
00:48:15,391 --> 00:48:17,552
-Leave them alone.
-Get up!

608
00:48:17,726 --> 00:48:19,193
Mom!

609
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:26,095
Beth. Beth.

610
00:48:26,735 --> 00:48:29,670
-Jack. Jack!
-All right! Move!

611
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:31,864
-Okay...
-Move!

612
00:48:32,041 --> 00:48:33,770
...let's do this a different way.

613
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,544
You'll find a way in, Jack.

614
00:49:13,716 --> 00:49:15,183
That's why we chose you.

615
00:49:17,786 --> 00:49:20,482
Hey, you mind if I watch TV?

616
00:49:24,827 --> 00:49:26,954
Where's my mom?

617
00:49:28,230 --> 00:49:30,790
She's upstairs, asleep.

618
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:33,298
No, she's not.

619
00:49:35,171 --> 00:49:39,164
-Where's my dad?
-He's in his office, working.

620
00:49:39,341 --> 00:49:41,206
Well, can I see him?

621
00:49:43,112 --> 00:49:44,807
No.

622
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:49,848
I know, I'm sorry.

623
00:49:50,019 --> 00:49:51,816
I made a rule.

624
00:49:54,456 --> 00:49:56,583
I'll let you see him in a bit, okay?

625
00:49:58,994 --> 00:50:01,326
-Okay.
-Good.

626
00:50:04,166 --> 00:50:05,793
Why have I got no sound?

627
00:50:06,268 --> 00:50:07,895
Is it broken?

628
00:50:08,671 --> 00:50:11,196
No. Give it to me.

629
00:50:14,210 --> 00:50:16,269
<i>Fred, why don't you give up.</i>

630
00:50:16,445 --> 00:50:18,413
So you're a genius.

631
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:20,673
Thank you.

632
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:43,066
-You want a cookie?
-Have they got nuts?

633
00:50:43,405 --> 00:50:46,863
-Why?
-I'm allergic.

634
00:50:47,943 --> 00:50:50,844
I'm sorry, Andy. I didn't know.
Let me check.

635
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:56,847
No.

636
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:59,146
No, no, no.

637
00:50:59,321 --> 00:51:01,881
Not a peanut in sight. You're fine.

638
00:51:05,227 --> 00:51:06,854
I promise.

639
00:51:33,989 --> 00:51:36,048
Jack! Jack!

640
00:51:36,225 --> 00:51:38,887
-Andy? Andy!
-Come on.

641
00:51:39,061 --> 00:51:40,756
Come on, baby.

642
00:51:40,929 --> 00:51:42,726
Breathe for Mommy. Come on, angel.

643
00:51:42,898 --> 00:51:44,923
Andy, breathe for Mommy.

644
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,830
-He's going into shock.
-Is he breathing?

645
00:51:48,003 --> 00:51:51,336
-Is he breathing?
-Barely. He's just barely breathing.

646
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:53,167
-It's not here.
-Come on, honey.

647
00:51:53,342 --> 00:51:54,707
Get his backpack. Come on.

648
00:51:58,614 --> 00:52:01,082
Stay with me, Andy. Stay with me.

649
00:52:02,117 --> 00:52:04,381
-It's not here.
-Mom, it's not here!

650
00:52:04,553 --> 00:52:06,282
Stay here. Stay here, Andy.

651
00:52:06,455 --> 00:52:11,392
Oh, God. Come on, honey.
Do something, he's dying.

652
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:13,460
-Breathe for Mommy.
-Andy.

653
00:52:13,629 --> 00:52:15,426
Give it to me, please.

654
00:52:15,964 --> 00:52:18,865
I'll do whatever you want.
Give it to me, please.

655
00:52:20,002 --> 00:52:21,629
Please.

656
00:52:23,038 --> 00:52:24,938
Come on, breathe. Breathe!

657
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:27,101
-I've got it.
-He's not breathing.

658
00:52:27,276 --> 00:52:28,573
I've got it.

659
00:52:29,211 --> 00:52:31,702
Come on, baby. He's not breathing.

660
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:39,711
Okay. You're all right, honey.

661
00:52:39,888 --> 00:52:42,789
-You're okay.
-He's okay. He's okay.

662
00:52:45,594 --> 00:52:47,391
Are you all right, big fella?

663
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:52,867
Good.

664
00:53:31,507 --> 00:53:35,944
I need my daughter's MP3 player
to use as a hard drive.

665
00:53:50,259 --> 00:53:51,988
Honey.

666
00:53:52,628 --> 00:53:55,256
I need to borrow your iPod.

667
00:53:56,098 --> 00:53:57,326
Will I get it back?

668
00:53:58,934 --> 00:54:00,799
Sure. I promise.

669
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:08,369
Here.

670
00:54:08,744 --> 00:54:11,872
Thanks, sweetie. Go back to sleep.

671
00:54:15,684 --> 00:54:18,175
This is the scanner head
from the fax machine.

672
00:54:18,353 --> 00:54:19,581
Yeah.

673
00:54:19,755 --> 00:54:23,691
And you'll capture the images of
the account numbers off the server screen...

674
00:54:23,859 --> 00:54:25,190
...and transfer them to this.

675
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,658
Ten thousand songs,
1 0,000 account codes...

676
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:29,422
...it doesn't know the difference.

677
00:54:29,598 --> 00:54:32,123
-How will you run the actual file?
-I won't.

678
00:54:32,301 --> 00:54:34,929
I'll have the maintenance department
in Wichita do it.

679
00:54:35,671 --> 00:54:38,265
But they're still just images.
What are you gonna do?

680
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,501
Use an OCR program to convert it to data
that the computer can use.

681
00:54:42,678 --> 00:54:47,547
-Then use my merge program from the CD.
-That's right.

682
00:54:48,617 --> 00:54:49,845
What about the money?

683
00:54:50,018 --> 00:54:54,250
Then I just need access to a wire-transfer
terminal, and you'll get your money.

684
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:56,724
Vel?

685
00:54:56,892 --> 00:54:58,723
It should work.

686
00:54:59,528 --> 00:55:00,756
It better.

687
00:55:13,408 --> 00:55:16,138
-Hello?
-<i>How'd it go?</i>

688
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:19,708
Fine, considering.

689
00:55:20,148 --> 00:55:22,116
<i>How's it going at your end?</i>

690
00:55:22,284 --> 00:55:24,650
I'll have it finished
by the time you get here.

691
00:55:26,021 --> 00:55:28,819
I guess I never thought we'd pull this off.

692
00:55:28,991 --> 00:55:31,357
<i>I know. What time does your flight get in?</i>
<i>I'll pick you up.</i>

693
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:13,735
Fire her.

694
00:56:14,772 --> 00:56:16,501
What?

695
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:20,505
Fire Janet? Why?

696
00:56:20,678 --> 00:56:23,112
I don't like the way she looks at me.

697
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,872
Fire her.

698
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:28,612
-Anything else?
-I'm good. Thanks.

699
00:56:28,786 --> 00:56:31,778
-You're the only banker who drinks tea.
-I am?

700
00:56:31,956 --> 00:56:34,049
Give us a minute, will you?

701
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:48,863
Janet, I want you to pack up your stuff
and go home.

702
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:51,098
What? What do you mean?

703
00:56:52,343 --> 00:56:54,038
Just what I said.

704
00:56:54,545 --> 00:56:56,706
Pack up your stuff and go home.

705
00:56:57,681 --> 00:56:58,909
Why?

706
00:56:59,784 --> 00:57:01,649
You're fired.

707
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,482
-lf this is a joke, it's not funny, Jack.
-No, this is not a joke.

708
00:57:05,656 --> 00:57:09,490
I'll call Human Resources. I'll get you a job
with somebody else at the bank.

709
00:57:09,660 --> 00:57:12,754
-Right now, just do what I said.
-What are you talking about?

710
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:15,296
-Is this because of him?
-Don't argue with me.

711
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:21,234
-But, Jack, I haven't done anything wrong.
-Pack up your shit and get out of here.

712
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:23,066
Now.

713
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,604
Screw you, Jack.

714
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:35,107
When is Daddy coming home?

715
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:42,254
As soon as he can get them
some money from the bank.

716
00:57:42,426 --> 00:57:44,394
And then they'll leave?

717
00:57:44,562 --> 00:57:46,223
And then they'll leave.

718
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:54,730
<i>It was a good knife when you first got it.</i>
<i>Maybe six months later, it got dull.</i>

719
00:57:54,905 --> 00:57:56,566
<i>Ever try to cut a tomato with these?</i>

720
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,265
Cox is gonna kill you.
You know that, don't you?

721
00:57:59,443 --> 00:58:01,536
Just like Willy.

722
00:58:01,712 --> 00:58:03,179
Willy made mistakes.

723
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:05,474
You think he'll reward you
because you're good?

724
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:07,412
-Shut up.
-Soon as he has the money...

725
00:58:07,585 --> 00:58:10,349
-...you'll be no more use to him.
-Go back into the bedroom.

726
00:58:12,423 --> 00:58:15,256
He has no reason to let any of you live.

727
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:23,766
What I'm asking for isn't standard,
you know.

728
00:58:25,469 --> 00:58:26,993
They might not do it.

729
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:28,832
They might say:

730
00:58:29,507 --> 00:58:32,874
"We did it yesterday" or "It's scheduled
for tomorrow" or something.

731
00:58:33,043 --> 00:58:35,341
Get on with it. Make it happen.

732
00:58:47,558 --> 00:58:50,925
-<i>Operations.</i>
-Stacy, Jack Stanfield in Seattle.

733
00:58:51,095 --> 00:58:52,824
<i>Hi, Mr. Stanfield.</i>

734
00:58:52,997 --> 00:58:55,124
I need you to run
a maintenance sort program...

735
00:58:55,299 --> 00:58:58,063
...weigh all online accounts,
largest to smallest.

736
00:58:58,235 --> 00:59:00,294
<i>Give me a sec, I'll check.</i>

737
00:59:02,206 --> 00:59:03,434
<i>Okay, keycard.</i>

738
00:59:04,174 --> 00:59:06,870
Coming up. There you go.

739
00:59:07,711 --> 00:59:09,645
<i>Ready to run.</i>

740
00:59:09,813 --> 00:59:12,748
-I'm telling you, Arlin....
-Go and deal with it.

741
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,150
It's running, Stacy.

742
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:16,547
<i>Okay, if you need</i>--

743
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:18,085
Go.

744
00:59:22,326 --> 00:59:24,089
With money moving every nanosecond...

745
00:59:24,261 --> 00:59:26,559
...we have to provide a platform
for technology...

746
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,699
...to be able to maintain and control risk.

747
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:34,002
-You have to be thinking outside the box.
-Oh, I understand.

748
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:38,005
These geeks with their laptops can
figure out ways to steal money from you.

749
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:40,609
-Arlin, you lost?
-Hi, Jack.

750
00:59:40,778 --> 00:59:44,270
No, Gary's trying to teach me something
about the new technology.

751
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:45,676
-Well, good luck.
-Yeah.

752
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:48,841
I told him you've been trying that for years.
What are you up to?

753
00:59:49,019 --> 00:59:50,646
Well, there's a--

754
00:59:50,821 --> 00:59:53,016
I came down because there was...

755
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:55,317
...a maintenance issue
with one of the servers.

756
00:59:55,492 --> 00:59:57,187
Got the engineers coming down.

757
00:59:57,361 --> 00:59:59,989
I asked to be notified
about all maintenance issues.

758
01:00:00,164 --> 01:00:02,928
No one told me a server was down.

759
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:06,660
They probably didn't realize the procedures
changed. Wichita didn't call you?

760
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:08,304
No.

761
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:10,406
Who's "they"?

762
01:00:10,808 --> 01:00:13,208
I don't know. Janet took the call.

763
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:15,345
Did you fire her this morning?

764
01:00:15,512 --> 01:00:17,639
You know, Arlin,
it just wasn't working out.

765
01:00:17,815 --> 01:00:19,874
Seems kind of sudden.

766
01:00:21,352 --> 01:00:23,547
Well, actually, it's been....

767
01:00:25,389 --> 01:00:27,619
It's been building for a while.

768
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:32,228
Well, care to join us?
Help Gary unlock my analog brain?

769
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:35,160
I think I'd better get back to the office.

770
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:40,793
I'll check with you later.

771
01:00:42,106 --> 01:00:44,904
All right, Arlin, you gotta
understand two things:

772
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:48,533
-Number one, analog is for sissies.
-So I gathered.

773
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,425
He didn't wash his hands.

774
01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:43,532
That's why you should never eat
peanuts off a bar.

775
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:48,431
Let's go.

776
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:08,351
Can I take his collar off?

777
01:02:08,926 --> 01:02:11,793
-No, honey. He needs that.
-Beth, come with me, please.

778
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:15,089
-Where?
-Just downstairs.

779
01:02:15,265 --> 01:02:16,926
Mom.

780
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:19,467
-It's okay. I'll be right back.
-Now, Beth.

781
01:02:21,605 --> 01:02:22,833
Why do you hate us so much?

782
01:02:23,006 --> 01:02:27,136
I don't hate you, Sarah.
I just don't care about you.

783
01:02:31,148 --> 01:02:33,548
I need you to make a call.

784
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:40,247
Why--? Why would I say this?

785
01:02:42,626 --> 01:02:44,685
Make him believe you.

786
01:02:58,542 --> 01:03:00,806
Well, hopefully, that's the way....

787
01:03:09,653 --> 01:03:11,280
Which one is he?

788
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:13,655
The kid in the blue shirt.

789
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,325
Come here.

790
01:03:25,536 --> 01:03:27,595
Mr. Stanfield, sir?
Why did Janet get fired?

791
01:03:27,771 --> 01:03:30,467
-She didn't do anything.
-We know what you're up to, Bobby.

792
01:03:30,641 --> 01:03:32,336
What I'm up to?
What do you mean?

793
01:03:32,509 --> 01:03:35,774
You and Janet have made repeated
attempts to access secure information.

794
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:37,243
No, that's ridiculous.

795
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:40,178
She rolled over on you, Bobby.
She gave you up.

796
01:03:40,350 --> 01:03:41,840
What are you talking about, sir?

797
01:03:42,286 --> 01:03:45,187
Sit down. Sit down.

798
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:24,147
We'll be in touch, Bobby.

799
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:25,652
Hello?

800
01:05:28,759 --> 01:05:30,420
It's done.

801
01:05:30,594 --> 01:05:32,892
Vel, is the money there?

802
01:05:33,931 --> 01:05:35,262
Okay, good.

803
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:39,027
I've done everything you want.
When do I get my family back?

804
01:05:39,202 --> 01:05:42,262
We have some tidying up to do.

805
01:06:00,023 --> 01:06:04,187
Sir, I just wanted to say, regardless
of what you may have heard--

806
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:11,364
There are hidden cameras
in all the public areas...

807
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:14,436
...and some of the more sensitive areas
on the secure floors.

808
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:16,868
So you can see
the whole bank from here?

809
01:06:17,040 --> 01:06:19,133
These are archive files.

810
01:06:19,309 --> 01:06:21,243
Ninety-one cameras
running on 20 screens.

811
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:24,103
Wow, I bet you don't watch much TV
when you get home.

812
01:06:24,281 --> 01:06:26,044
I don't even have one.

813
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:28,712
-Sorry. Sorry.
-I got it.

814
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:51,768
Okay.

815
01:06:53,143 --> 01:06:56,544
-At least it didn't end up in the keyboard.
-Right.

816
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:02,508
We better get out of here before
we completely screw things up.

817
01:07:02,686 --> 01:07:04,347
-Thanks. Sorry.
-Thank you.

818
01:07:04,521 --> 01:07:06,386
All right.

819
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,964
-Where's Jack Stanfield?
-He just left.

820
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:21,969
-What was he doing in here?
-Making one hell of a mess.

821
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:25,131
-What the hell?
-What's wrong?

822
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:28,741
All the camera files have been deleted.

823
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,652
-What is this?
-Just press "send."

824
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,899
Now there's no network,
no account details.

825
01:08:00,110 --> 01:08:03,079
No trace of the 1 00 million.
Can I have the disk, please?

826
01:08:04,514 --> 01:08:09,281
Vel has a real talent
for being destructive...

827
01:08:09,453 --> 01:08:11,182
...do you not think?

828
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:17,021
See you at the house, Jack.

829
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:24,863
Jack, what's going on?
What are you up to?

830
01:08:25,035 --> 01:08:27,697
-I haven't got time for this now.
-You're gonna make time.

831
01:08:27,871 --> 01:08:31,967
You'll stay here and explain what you were
doing in areas you're not supposed to be in.

832
01:08:32,142 --> 01:08:34,110
No, I'm not.

833
01:08:34,945 --> 01:08:37,675
-Mr. Stanfield, the network--
-Tell him.

834
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:40,612
-What is it?
-The network just crashed.

835
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:42,718
-The whole floor?
-No, the whole building.

836
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:52,588
Stanfield!

837
01:08:59,102 --> 01:09:00,660
Jack! Stop right there!

838
01:09:00,837 --> 01:09:02,532
Jack!

839
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,110
-Get out of the car!
-Are you nuts?

840
01:09:12,282 --> 01:09:13,772
-You're nuts!
-Get away.

841
01:09:13,950 --> 01:09:18,148
Security-camera files are missing,
the computers just crashed...!

842
01:09:32,135 --> 01:09:33,466
Call the police.

843
01:09:33,637 --> 01:09:36,435
Security. We're in the garage,
get the police.

844
01:09:36,606 --> 01:09:37,595
Shit.

845
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:56,248
Beth?

846
01:09:59,162 --> 01:10:00,925
Beth!

847
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,902
Beth!

848
01:10:12,142 --> 01:10:13,871
Beth?

849
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,409
Oh, my God.

850
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:01,722
Where are they? Where's my family?

851
01:11:03,660 --> 01:11:05,252
Yeah, we're leaving now.

852
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,157
I'll meet you when I'm done.

853
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:09,627
Yeah, will do.

854
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,991
-Cox says goodbye.
-Are they alive?

855
01:11:12,168 --> 01:11:13,931
Just tell me that. Are they alive?

856
01:11:14,104 --> 01:11:16,572
-Come on, man, talk to me.
-We're leaving now, Jack.

857
01:11:16,740 --> 01:11:19,106
Why? Just kill me here.
Why should I make it easy?

858
01:11:19,276 --> 01:11:23,007
You still think there's a chance you might
be able to help them. Now, let's go.

859
01:12:22,005 --> 01:12:24,803
<i>Hi, it's Harry. Leave a message.</i>

860
01:12:25,675 --> 01:12:29,133
<i>Harry. Jesus, Harry, where are you?</i>

861
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:33,275
I'm in trouble. I'm in real trouble.

862
01:12:33,450 --> 01:12:35,111
I need....

863
01:12:35,285 --> 01:12:36,684
I need to talk to you.

864
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:38,753
Call me on my-- No, you can't.

865
01:12:38,922 --> 01:12:40,583
You can't call me on my cell.

866
01:12:40,757 --> 01:12:42,691
They're listening.

867
01:12:43,193 --> 01:12:44,922
Shit.

868
01:13:07,183 --> 01:13:09,617
It's really coming down, huh?

869
01:13:13,056 --> 01:13:16,355
-What a night.
-Well, it is Seattle.

870
01:14:41,010 --> 01:14:44,639
<i>Harry. Jesus, Harry, where are you?</i>

871
01:14:44,814 --> 01:14:47,578
<i>I'm in trouble. I'm in real trouble.</i>

872
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,149
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

873
01:14:49,319 --> 01:14:52,482
<i>Call me on my</i>-- <i>No, you can't.</i>
<i>You can't call me on my cell.</i>

874
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:56,053
<i>They're listening. Shit.</i>

875
01:14:57,827 --> 01:15:00,990
<i>This is Dr. Hay's office confirming</i>
<i>your 8 a.m. appointment Monday.</i>

876
01:15:01,164 --> 01:15:03,655
<i>So we'll see you then.</i>
<i>Thank you. Bye-bye.</i>

877
01:15:04,601 --> 01:15:07,729
<i>Harry, I did it. I finally left him.</i>

878
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:10,395
<i>God, I love you so much.</i>

879
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:16,102
<i>I'm afraid. Get out of there, okay?</i>
<i>Come as soon as you can.</i>

880
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,243
<i>I love you.</i>

881
01:15:19,516 --> 01:15:21,416
<i>Harry, it's Eric at Redline.</i>

882
01:15:21,584 --> 01:15:25,816
<i>I found a guy who's selling those</i>
<i>Porsche 356 parts you</i>--

883
01:15:28,691 --> 01:15:30,386
Yeah, come on in.

884
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:32,152
Thank you.

885
01:15:33,863 --> 01:15:35,797
Wow, quite a place.

886
01:15:36,165 --> 01:15:40,431
Yeah. I wanted something sort of
Dean Martin-ish, you know what I mean?

887
01:15:40,904 --> 01:15:42,132
Well, you nailed it.

888
01:15:42,305 --> 01:15:43,795
You know, I had my doubts.

889
01:15:43,973 --> 01:15:45,270
But after our meeting...

890
01:15:45,441 --> 01:15:48,569
...I could tell Jack was
definitely interested.

891
01:15:48,811 --> 01:15:50,335
And the timing was perfect.

892
01:15:50,513 --> 01:15:53,812
Without the merger, Jack would
never consider leaving the bank...

893
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,951
...and starting up on his own.

894
01:15:56,119 --> 01:15:58,053
-How about a beer?
-No, I'm good, thanks.

895
01:15:58,221 --> 01:16:02,123
Once Jack gets his teeth into it,
there'll be no stopping him.

896
01:16:02,292 --> 01:16:04,556
Thanks for pulling that proposal
together so fast.

897
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:08,495
-You know, I think I will have that beer.
-You bet.

898
01:16:26,649 --> 01:16:28,617
Harry?

899
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:30,480
Harry?

900
01:16:32,855 --> 01:16:34,789
Oh, Jesus.

901
01:16:51,975 --> 01:16:53,806
Sure it wasn't the TV, Mrs. Levy?

902
01:16:53,977 --> 01:16:57,879
<i>No, it wasn't the damn TV. I'm telling you,</i>
<i>the guy had a gun in his hand.</i>

903
01:16:58,047 --> 01:16:59,480
Okay, what'd the guy look like?

904
01:16:59,649 --> 01:17:02,345
<i>He was wearing a gray suit with,</i>
<i>like, a necktie.</i>

905
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:15,890
Shit.

906
01:17:18,334 --> 01:17:20,029
Taxi.

907
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,004
Hey, taxi! Taxi!

908
01:17:42,358 --> 01:17:45,691
Let's go inside and play. Get your toy.

909
01:17:46,029 --> 01:17:47,656
Janet?

910
01:17:48,297 --> 01:17:50,390
Janet--

911
01:17:51,634 --> 01:17:54,228
Janet Stone. She--

912
01:17:54,671 --> 01:17:56,434
-Thank you.
-Over there.

913
01:17:56,606 --> 01:17:57,834
Janet.

914
01:17:58,007 --> 01:18:01,374
-Janet. Janet, let me in, please.
-What are you doing here?

915
01:18:01,544 --> 01:18:04,104
-Get out of here, Jack. You're crazy!
-Let me in.

916
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,373
Get out!

917
01:18:10,386 --> 01:18:13,583
Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me.

918
01:18:13,756 --> 01:18:15,451
The man who was in my office.

919
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:18,355
Mr. Redmond. He's a bank robber.

920
01:18:18,528 --> 01:18:21,827
He's got Beth and the kids.
He's gonna kill them.

921
01:18:21,998 --> 01:18:23,989
They may be dead already.
I need your help.

922
01:18:24,167 --> 01:18:28,399
Do you understand me?
I need your help to try and save them.

923
01:18:29,205 --> 01:18:30,672
Okay.

924
01:18:31,107 --> 01:18:33,769
-I understand.
-Don't scream.

925
01:18:41,117 --> 01:18:43,415
-Sorry.
-Shouldn't we call the police?

926
01:18:46,889 --> 01:18:48,914
No. No police.

927
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:50,821
What about Harry?

928
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:54,758
Harry's dead.

929
01:18:55,665 --> 01:18:57,826
Jesus.

930
01:19:00,536 --> 01:19:03,027
I was at Harry's apartment when Cox...

931
01:19:03,206 --> 01:19:05,868
...or Redmond, whatever his name is,
shot him.

932
01:19:06,042 --> 01:19:08,533
People there saw me
with a gun in my hand.

933
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:11,407
There's a dead man in my house.

934
01:19:11,581 --> 01:19:13,344
By the time I explain to the police...

935
01:19:14,984 --> 01:19:17,748
-...Beth and the kids could be dead.
-God.

936
01:19:17,954 --> 01:19:19,785
I need you to help me find Bobby.

937
01:19:19,956 --> 01:19:21,924
-Bobby? Why?
-I need his cell phone.

938
01:19:22,091 --> 01:19:24,992
I used his phone to photograph
some account code numbers.

939
01:19:25,161 --> 01:19:28,221
I've gotta have it to get the money back.
Can you help me?

940
01:19:28,397 --> 01:19:30,922
Yeah. I'll find his number.

941
01:19:50,253 --> 01:19:53,620
Why can't you get
a rare burger anymore?

942
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:55,849
E. coli.

943
01:19:58,327 --> 01:20:01,125
-Everything all right?
-Yeah. Did you talk to Liam?

944
01:20:01,297 --> 01:20:04,994
-No, not yet.
-Where the hell is he, man?

945
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:07,063
-Let's go.
-Now?

946
01:20:07,236 --> 01:20:09,033
Yeah, now!

947
01:20:10,606 --> 01:20:11,903
Shit.

948
01:20:12,608 --> 01:20:15,042
You guys need to go to the washroom?

949
01:20:15,678 --> 01:20:17,873
Don't say I didn't ask.

950
01:20:26,823 --> 01:20:28,381
Jack.

951
01:20:28,758 --> 01:20:30,692
-Jesus.
-I found Bobby.

952
01:20:30,860 --> 01:20:32,987
Oh, great.

953
01:20:36,332 --> 01:20:39,495
-It's Cox.
-Are you gonna answer?

954
01:20:40,736 --> 01:20:45,503
I'm not ready to talk to him yet.
I need Bobby's cell phone first.

955
01:20:45,808 --> 01:20:48,800
-And I'll need your laptop.
-No problem.

956
01:20:48,978 --> 01:20:52,675
-And can we use your car?
-Problem.

957
01:20:53,549 --> 01:20:55,779
Pop it! Pop it! Pop the clutch!

958
01:20:57,253 --> 01:20:59,744
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

959
01:21:02,491 --> 01:21:03,753
Keep the gas up.

960
01:21:18,441 --> 01:21:21,239
I can't believe Harry's dead.

961
01:21:22,912 --> 01:21:24,880
Was he involved with Cox?

962
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:26,810
No.

963
01:21:29,552 --> 01:21:32,578
No. Harry thought he was a businessman.

964
01:21:33,089 --> 01:21:36,252
But didn't Harry introduce you to Cox?

965
01:21:36,425 --> 01:21:38,256
The whole...

966
01:21:39,195 --> 01:21:41,959
...investment thing was just a scam.

967
01:21:42,832 --> 01:21:46,791
Cox was using Harry to get next to me.
Harry didn't know about the robbery.

968
01:21:47,870 --> 01:21:49,770
Cox killed him with my gun...

969
01:21:49,939 --> 01:21:54,706
...to make it look as if I shot him
in a jealous rage over Beth.

970
01:21:54,877 --> 01:21:57,675
Harry and Beth? Give me a break.

971
01:21:57,847 --> 01:22:03,752
He planted a message from Beth
on Harry's answering machine.

972
01:22:06,522 --> 01:22:08,752
Saying she....

973
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,688
Saying she was leaving me.

974
01:22:14,997 --> 01:22:20,299
I also found some encrypted files
on his computer.

975
01:22:20,469 --> 01:22:24,462
I'm sure they'd tie him and me
together in the robbery.

976
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,165
Cox had it all planned out.

977
01:22:27,343 --> 01:22:28,901
Even the gambling debts.

978
01:22:30,379 --> 01:22:32,347
We hatch this plan to rob the bank...

979
01:22:32,515 --> 01:22:34,813
...then I find out my buddy is
sleeping with my wife.

980
01:22:35,284 --> 01:22:38,981
After the robbery, I go to his apartment,
I kill him and I....

981
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:43,020
I disappear with the money forever.

982
01:22:44,493 --> 01:22:46,961
Forever, as in dead?

983
01:22:50,266 --> 01:22:53,326
I killed the man who was
supposed to kill me.

984
01:23:11,554 --> 01:23:13,647
Be right back.

985
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:39,907
-What are you doing?
-I didn't tell Jack any of that stuff.

986
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:43,779
-Why did he say you did?
-I don't know. I'm sorry about that.

987
01:23:43,953 --> 01:23:45,477
Can I borrow your cell phone?

988
01:23:45,654 --> 01:23:48,919
Your cell phone, do you have it?
Can I borrow it?

989
01:23:49,759 --> 01:23:51,283
Thanks.

990
01:23:55,831 --> 01:23:57,822
-Here.
-Great.

991
01:23:58,034 --> 01:23:59,501
Please let this work.

992
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,440
-Here we go.
-Now what?

993
01:24:13,616 --> 01:24:16,050
I just need to find
a wire-transfer terminal.

994
01:24:16,218 --> 01:24:19,381
Where are you gonna find
a bank open at this hour?

995
01:24:21,824 --> 01:24:25,658
<i>Welcome to Seattle-Tacoma</i>
<i>International Airport.</i>

996
01:24:30,766 --> 01:24:33,530
Jack, you look like a bank robber.

997
01:24:35,538 --> 01:24:37,904
-Keep the motor running.
-Good luck.

998
01:24:38,607 --> 01:24:40,302
Thank you.

999
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:09,461
We'll see you in the morning.

1000
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:14,973
I'm sorry, we're closed.

1001
01:25:22,384 --> 01:25:25,182
I need to get on your
wire-transfer terminal.

1002
01:25:25,354 --> 01:25:26,878
Absolutely. I'm sorry.

1003
01:25:27,056 --> 01:25:30,253
We usually don't have
a supervisor here this late.

1004
01:25:30,426 --> 01:25:31,984
-You can use this one.
-Thank you.

1005
01:25:34,029 --> 01:25:35,587
The money is put away. l--

1006
01:25:35,764 --> 01:25:38,324
It's not about the money.
Sit down. Sit down.

1007
01:25:39,702 --> 01:25:41,135
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1008
01:25:42,338 --> 01:25:47,366
84991 1 6....

1009
01:26:08,764 --> 01:26:10,197
Liam, where have you been?

1010
01:26:10,366 --> 01:26:12,197
Change of plans, asshole.

1011
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:16,366
Jack. Where are you?

1012
01:26:16,539 --> 01:26:20,873
At a bank. I just hacked
into your Cayman Island accounts.

1013
01:26:21,043 --> 01:26:23,102
-<i>That's impossible.</i>
-You think so?

1014
01:26:23,279 --> 01:26:27,147
<i>I have your account details.</i>
<i>You just lost 20 million.</i>

1015
01:26:27,316 --> 01:26:29,250
Bullshit.

1016
01:26:38,661 --> 01:26:40,026
What's going on?

1017
01:26:40,196 --> 01:26:41,458
Check the accounts.

1018
01:26:41,630 --> 01:26:44,463
-What for?
-Can you check the accounts, please?

1019
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,698
Yeah.

1020
01:26:53,375 --> 01:26:54,933
There goes another 20 million.

1021
01:26:55,778 --> 01:26:57,507
-Come on.
-I'm going as fast as I can.

1022
01:26:59,181 --> 01:27:01,775
We're down 40 million.

1023
01:27:01,984 --> 01:27:05,351
Now you know what it feels like
to lose what you love.

1024
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:09,013
-Another account just cleared.
-That was for Harry.

1025
01:27:09,225 --> 01:27:11,716
Your family are dead. Do you hear me?
They are dead!

1026
01:27:11,894 --> 01:27:13,885
For all I know, they're dead already.

1027
01:27:14,797 --> 01:27:16,230
He emptied another one.

1028
01:27:16,398 --> 01:27:18,263
You're down to your last 20 million.

1029
01:27:24,607 --> 01:27:27,075
-Talk to your husband.
-Jack?

1030
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:31,908
<i>I love you. Just do whatever you can</i>
<i>to save the children.</i>

1031
01:27:32,081 --> 01:27:35,642
I am, baby. I love you too.

1032
01:27:38,187 --> 01:27:41,247
Put the money back
or I'll put a bullet through her head.

1033
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:44,017
You do anything to her or my children...

1034
01:27:44,193 --> 01:27:46,093
<i>...and you don't get a dime.</i>

1035
01:27:46,262 --> 01:27:47,490
It's all gone.

1036
01:27:47,997 --> 01:27:50,397
Jack, calm down.
If you calm down, we can talk this--

1037
01:27:50,566 --> 01:27:52,898
You'll get the money
when I get my family.

1038
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:55,935
Tomorrow morning, when the banks open.
I'll let you know where.

1039
01:27:56,438 --> 01:27:58,872
-Yeah, I'll be there.
-<i>Do you hear me?</i>

1040
01:27:59,041 --> 01:28:01,305
-I'll be there. Just--
-<i>Don't bother calling me.</i>

1041
01:28:01,644 --> 01:28:04,477
Because I've got nothing to say to you.

1042
01:28:06,548 --> 01:28:08,607
-You need to get out of here.
-What?

1043
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,684
-I pushed the silent alarm.
-When?

1044
01:28:10,853 --> 01:28:14,118
A couple of minutes ago. I'm sorry.

1045
01:28:14,723 --> 01:28:16,486
Liam was gonna take care of him.

1046
01:28:16,659 --> 01:28:18,092
Put the woman back in the van.

1047
01:28:18,260 --> 01:28:22,253
-How you gonna give me my money?!
-Put her back in the van!

1048
01:28:25,701 --> 01:28:27,191
Shut up!

1049
01:28:31,573 --> 01:28:33,336
Shit.

1050
01:28:43,185 --> 01:28:45,050
-Move it!
-Just a second. Here he is.

1051
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:47,711
-Get out of here, now.
-Sorry.

1052
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:50,618
What happened?

1053
01:28:51,160 --> 01:28:52,923
They're alive.

1054
01:28:53,128 --> 01:28:54,356
Thank God.

1055
01:28:54,530 --> 01:28:57,021
I just bet everything on Cox's greed.

1056
01:28:57,199 --> 01:28:58,928
I got the money.

1057
01:28:59,101 --> 01:29:01,433
So we still got a chance.

1058
01:29:02,237 --> 01:29:03,534
What are you gonna do?

1059
01:29:03,706 --> 01:29:06,573
I'm gonna meet Cox at the bank
in the morning.

1060
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:09,507
-How are you gonna get in?
-I can't. You can.

1061
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:11,703
You fired me, remember?
I don't have a pass.

1062
01:29:16,618 --> 01:29:19,212
Barking. Jesus, he was barking.

1063
01:29:19,388 --> 01:29:20,650
-Jack?
-He was....

1064
01:29:20,823 --> 01:29:22,552
Pull over. Pull over here.

1065
01:29:31,867 --> 01:29:33,892
Jack, what are you doing?

1066
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:37,238
I heard Rusty barking.

1067
01:29:37,406 --> 01:29:40,375
-He's with Beth and the kids in the van.
-So?

1068
01:29:40,542 --> 01:29:42,305
He's got this...

1069
01:29:42,711 --> 01:29:45,874
...GPS. He's got this GPS thing.

1070
01:29:46,048 --> 01:29:47,845
You're not making any sense.

1071
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:50,109
He was running away all the time...

1072
01:29:50,285 --> 01:29:52,446
...so we got him a collar
with a GPS locator.

1073
01:29:52,621 --> 01:29:55,488
It's from this website.
If he's still got it on....

1074
01:29:59,395 --> 01:30:01,761
Got him. There they are.

1075
01:30:05,267 --> 01:30:06,632
What are they doing?

1076
01:30:06,802 --> 01:30:08,099
Driving out of town.

1077
01:30:08,270 --> 01:30:11,433
Why is he doing that?
Didn't he say he would meet you here?

1078
01:30:12,574 --> 01:30:15,042
-Here. Get in the car.
-What are you doing?

1079
01:30:16,078 --> 01:30:18,012
I'm gonna find my dog.

1080
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:35,289
Can you shut the dog up?

1081
01:30:35,464 --> 01:30:36,988
It's okay, Rusty.

1082
01:30:39,435 --> 01:30:41,665
You know, you're never
gonna get that money now.

1083
01:30:42,738 --> 01:30:47,141
But if you turn around and take us back, my
husband can give you whatever you want.

1084
01:30:47,309 --> 01:30:51,177
-You can split it between the two of you.
-Shut the damn dog up!

1085
01:31:11,533 --> 01:31:13,194
Jack.

1086
01:31:14,770 --> 01:31:16,738
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay. Yeah.

1087
01:31:16,905 --> 01:31:18,805
-You want me to drive?
-No. No, I'm fine.

1088
01:31:20,142 --> 01:31:21,404
Where are they now?

1089
01:31:22,644 --> 01:31:23,906
They're still on the 2.

1090
01:31:51,206 --> 01:31:53,037
They just turned off the road.

1091
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:56,905
There's nothing on this map
except a big lake and some railroad tracks.

1092
01:31:57,079 --> 01:31:59,343
-How far?
-Twenty miles.

1093
01:31:59,515 --> 01:32:02,143
Where the hell are they going?

1094
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:07,512
Shut up.

1095
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:11,059
Shut your goddamn dog up.
I swear to God.

1096
01:32:11,226 --> 01:32:12,818
It's okay, Rusty.

1097
01:32:12,995 --> 01:32:15,054
-Come here, Rusty. Come here.
-Shut up!

1098
01:32:17,733 --> 01:32:19,598
That's it!

1099
01:32:20,302 --> 01:32:22,065
I warned you!

1100
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:26,099
What are you doing? No! Rusty!

1101
01:32:26,341 --> 01:32:28,969
Shut up or you're going next!

1102
01:32:30,145 --> 01:32:32,613
-Rusty! Sorry, baby.
-Quiet!

1103
01:32:32,814 --> 01:32:34,748
You hear me?

1104
01:33:05,781 --> 01:33:07,009
Put them in the back room.

1105
01:33:07,182 --> 01:33:09,776
Maybe we should just forget it.

1106
01:33:09,952 --> 01:33:11,476
Let them all go.

1107
01:33:11,653 --> 01:33:15,885
Maybe you should do your job
and put them in the back room.

1108
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,961
Why would he bring them
all the way out here?

1109
01:33:31,006 --> 01:33:35,841
I don't think he was planning
on leaving anyone alive.

1110
01:33:39,114 --> 01:33:40,843
God.

1111
01:33:49,191 --> 01:33:50,556
-Hey.
-Oh, my God. Come here.

1112
01:33:50,726 --> 01:33:51,988
-It's all right.
-Hey.

1113
01:33:52,160 --> 01:33:55,095
-He can't breathe.
-Sit your ass down. I don't give a rat's ass.

1114
01:33:55,263 --> 01:33:58,664
-I'm sick of you people, man.
-Honey.

1115
01:33:59,134 --> 01:34:00,897
Vel.

1116
01:34:01,603 --> 01:34:03,833
Please help us.

1117
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:15,976
We need to exchange you...

1118
01:34:16,151 --> 01:34:20,110
...for the money,
and then we'll let you go.

1119
01:34:21,356 --> 01:34:22,823
Okay?

1120
01:34:24,326 --> 01:34:26,226
You'll be all right.

1121
01:34:26,395 --> 01:34:27,657
Thank you.

1122
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:38,370
They're slowing down.

1123
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:43,040
Look.

1124
01:34:50,352 --> 01:34:51,944
Rusty.

1125
01:34:52,587 --> 01:34:53,849
Rusty.

1126
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:56,889
Come here, Rusty. It's okay.

1127
01:34:57,726 --> 01:35:00,092
Where are they, Rusty?

1128
01:35:01,163 --> 01:35:02,494
Where have they gone?

1129
01:35:02,664 --> 01:35:04,825
Where's Andy?

1130
01:35:09,371 --> 01:35:12,306
There's a house down there by the lake.
I see Beth's car.

1131
01:35:12,474 --> 01:35:13,998
-You got a cell phone?
-Yeah.

1132
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,438
Call the police.

1133
01:35:15,610 --> 01:35:18,044
Shouldn't we just wait here
for the police?

1134
01:35:18,980 --> 01:35:20,607
No.

1135
01:35:20,782 --> 01:35:22,511
I can't. I can't wait.

1136
01:35:22,684 --> 01:35:24,151
Thanks for everything.

1137
01:35:24,319 --> 01:35:26,378
You got your job back.

1138
01:36:08,430 --> 01:36:10,125
Will he call?

1139
01:36:10,832 --> 01:36:13,096
You think he'll just give us the money,
no police?

1140
01:36:14,136 --> 01:36:17,196
He knows I'll kill his family if he doesn't.

1141
01:36:20,308 --> 01:36:23,436
I just need to up the ante a little.

1142
01:36:28,683 --> 01:36:31,015
No. Please don't.
What are you doing?

1143
01:36:31,186 --> 01:36:32,983
-Let her go!
-No!

1144
01:36:33,155 --> 01:36:34,713
Stop it!

1145
01:36:35,557 --> 01:36:36,819
-My God!
-Oh, my God!

1146
01:36:36,992 --> 01:36:38,391
-Come on.
-Shut up!

1147
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:40,960
Why are you doing this?

1148
01:36:41,229 --> 01:36:42,457
Pim!

1149
01:36:50,572 --> 01:36:52,233
Come here!

1150
01:37:05,320 --> 01:37:08,084
Where you at, sweetie? Wanna play?

1151
01:37:08,256 --> 01:37:10,520
Marco.

1152
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:12,387
Polo.

1153
01:37:15,597 --> 01:37:17,462
Marco.

1154
01:37:17,632 --> 01:37:20,100
Polo.

1155
01:37:30,645 --> 01:37:32,044
Hey!

1156
01:37:46,094 --> 01:37:47,721
-Help! We're in here!
-Come on!

1157
01:37:54,336 --> 01:37:55,564
Dad!

1158
01:37:56,471 --> 01:37:58,803
-Dad!
-Run, Sarah. Run and hide!

1159
01:38:00,008 --> 01:38:01,805
-Move it!
-Dad!

1160
01:38:01,977 --> 01:38:04,445
Put him down. Let him go! Oh, my--

1161
01:38:09,217 --> 01:38:11,685
Get upstairs now!

1162
01:38:17,993 --> 01:38:20,086
Come on, get up the stairs!

1163
01:38:20,262 --> 01:38:23,561
-Move it! Move it!
-Let me go!

1164
01:38:25,267 --> 01:38:27,633
Go on, now. Move it! Get up there!

1165
01:38:39,447 --> 01:38:40,846
Daddy!

1166
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:45,075
Daddy!

1167
01:39:34,703 --> 01:39:36,170
-Jack!
-Run, Beth! Run!

1168
01:39:36,638 --> 01:39:38,071
Run.

1169
01:40:47,742 --> 01:40:49,232
Beth.

1170
01:40:49,577 --> 01:40:50,805
Beth!

1171
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:53,542
Jack?

1172
01:40:53,715 --> 01:40:55,706
Beth!

1173
01:40:58,586 --> 01:41:00,315
Jack!
