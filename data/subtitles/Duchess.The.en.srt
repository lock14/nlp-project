2
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:02,463
Lord Thomas.

3
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:06,499
Lord Henry.

4
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:09,465
Lord Ambrose.

5
00:01:11,908 --> 00:01:13,273
Lord Robert.

6
00:01:15,778 --> 00:01:17,177
Lord Walter.

7
00:01:20,616 --> 00:01:22,049
You'd better not let me down,
Charles Grey.

8
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:27,282
- I've got 20 guineas riding on you.
- Only 20? I'd double that if I were you.

9
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:33,256
Come on,
ladies.

10
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,631
Gentlemen, twice around the course,
on my count.

11
00:01:44,407 --> 00:01:46,102
Three, two,

12
00:01:48,378 --> 00:01:49,640
one!

13
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:51,270
- Come on, Mr. Grey!
- Come on, Thomas!

14
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:54,350
- Come on, Mr. Grey!
- Run, Lord Walter!

15
00:01:54,884 --> 00:01:56,715
Come on, Mr. Grey!

16
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:59,481
Come on, Mr. Grey.
You're tired already.

17
00:01:59,589 --> 00:02:02,149
- Come on, Mr. Grey!
- Faster!

18
00:02:16,305 --> 00:02:19,763
I trust Your Grace still finds Georgiana
an attractive girl?

19
00:02:19,876 --> 00:02:21,867
Of course, Lady Spencer.

20
00:02:21,978 --> 00:02:25,812
She's an accomplished lady of quality
and devoted to her duties.

21
00:02:25,915 --> 00:02:28,543
She's fluent in French, Italian, Latin

22
00:02:28,651 --> 00:02:31,449
and fully versed in horsemanship
and dancing and...

23
00:02:31,554 --> 00:02:35,422
Yes, I'm aware of all that.
She's a credit to you.

24
00:02:37,293 --> 00:02:39,090
I can't think of anything
that would stand in the way

25
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:41,356
of a singularly happy marriage.

26
00:02:41,464 --> 00:02:44,763
These are not the issues
that burden the Duke, Lady Spencer.

27
00:02:44,867 --> 00:02:48,064
It is His Grace's duty to produce an heir.

28
00:02:48,171 --> 00:02:49,536
On the other hand,
your daughter may expect

29
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,107
a handsome reward when that occurs.

30
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:55,507
- Thank you, Heaton.
- Your Grace.

31
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:58,544
Your Grace may rest assured.

32
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:02,106
The women in our family
have never forfeited on that account.

33
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:06,013
Well, with that assurance...

34
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:16,822
So be it, then.

35
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,865
Come on, Mr. Grey!

36
00:03:28,878 --> 00:03:33,110
I do apologize, ladies,
but it appears that my horse has won.

37
00:03:34,717 --> 00:03:36,446
Beat me again, Charles.

38
00:03:38,521 --> 00:03:42,252
- Well done, Mr. Grey.
- Well done.

39
00:03:42,425 --> 00:03:44,950
- So how much do we owe you?
- You owe me 40.

40
00:03:45,061 --> 00:03:49,191
- Twenty, 40.
- My reward?

41
00:03:54,303 --> 00:03:56,771
And what do you suggest?

42
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:59,865
Your mother wishes to see you,
Lady Georgiana.

43
00:04:11,754 --> 00:04:13,085
Thank you.

44
00:04:29,739 --> 00:04:32,207
I must apologize, Mama.
Were we making too much noise?

45
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:33,866
Not at all, my darling.

46
00:04:33,976 --> 00:04:37,275
We have more important things
to talk of. Come here.

47
00:04:45,421 --> 00:04:48,857
- I have heard a rumor.
- Yes?

48
00:04:50,259 --> 00:04:52,056
That I will soon be addressing
my daughter

49
00:04:52,161 --> 00:04:55,255
as Her Grace,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

50
00:04:56,832 --> 00:04:59,460
- Is it true, Mama?
- It is.

51
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:03,804
The Duke of Devonshire?

52
00:05:08,377 --> 00:05:11,540
I had hoped not to part with you
until 18 at the soonest,

53
00:05:11,647 --> 00:05:12,671
but, with such a fine match,

54
00:05:12,782 --> 00:05:15,376
it would be selfish of me
not to let you go.

55
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:17,384
- He loves me?
- Yes, of course.

56
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:19,249
I have only met him twice.

57
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:20,788
When one truly loves someone,

58
00:05:20,890 --> 00:05:23,290
one doesn't have to know them well
to be sure, Georgiana.

59
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:25,394
One feels it right away.

60
00:05:27,897 --> 00:05:32,834
- I do believe you will be happy with him.
- I shall, Mama. I know I shall.

61
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:12,223
- Come on!
- She's here!

62
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,427
Your Grace! Your Grace!

63
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:24,240
- There she is!
- Duchess!

64
00:07:24,346 --> 00:07:26,814
What do they want?

65
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,714
To see me and my new wife, of course.

66
00:07:31,854 --> 00:07:34,948
It can be a nuisance,
but you'll get used to it.

67
00:08:31,046 --> 00:08:32,809
Welcome, Your Grace.

68
00:08:49,398 --> 00:08:52,333
Come, boys. Come on.
Hugo, Hugo. Come.

69
00:08:52,434 --> 00:08:55,699
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

70
00:08:57,106 --> 00:09:00,371
It's all right. Yes, yes. This way.

71
00:09:02,244 --> 00:09:04,235
Hugo. Come, boy. Come.

72
00:09:40,783 --> 00:09:45,117
Scissors. You may go.

73
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:20,052
For the life of me,
I could never understand

74
00:10:20,155 --> 00:10:23,352
why women's clothes
must be so damn complicated.

75
00:10:25,527 --> 00:10:28,894
It's just our way
of expressing ourselves, I suppose.

76
00:10:32,468 --> 00:10:35,232
Whatever do you mean?

77
00:10:35,337 --> 00:10:38,898
Well, you have so many ways
of expressing yourselves,

78
00:10:39,008 --> 00:10:43,240
whereas we must make do
with our hats and our dresses.

79
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,648
Would you go to the bed?

80
00:12:37,313 --> 00:12:40,009
One has to accept one's responsibility.

81
00:12:40,116 --> 00:12:41,777
Certain obligations come with marriage,

82
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:43,818
no matter how burdensome
they may seem.

83
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:46,683
Yes, but when we are together...

84
00:12:48,391 --> 00:12:52,191
But when we are together, intimately,
I mean...

85
00:12:52,294 --> 00:12:54,626
I know. It can be a bother.

86
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,494
However, it is only
until you have given him a son.

87
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:02,196
Then the occasions will become fewer
and less determined.

88
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:03,896
I think it might feel different

89
00:13:04,006 --> 00:13:06,873
if he would talk to me
every once in a while.

90
00:13:06,976 --> 00:13:10,935
I mean, it's not that he's unkind,
but he never talks to me.

91
00:13:11,047 --> 00:13:12,309
I thought that he would be like Papa,

92
00:13:12,415 --> 00:13:14,542
that under his cool reserve

93
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:17,244
there'd be a wealth of depth
and sentiment,

94
00:13:17,353 --> 00:13:22,882
but he isn't interested in anything,
apart from his dogs.

95
00:13:22,992 --> 00:13:24,823
Try not to be too hard on His Grace, G.

96
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:27,987
He's merely intent on fulfilling his duty.

97
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:32,466
And as for talking to him,
well, whatever is there to talk about?

98
00:13:32,568 --> 00:13:35,196
No, you're quite right.

99
00:13:35,304 --> 00:13:37,534
How foolish of me to think
that I should be able to converse

100
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,631
with my husband.

101
00:13:39,742 --> 00:13:43,735
Georgiana, equip yourself with patience,
fortitude and resignation.

102
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:47,009
A boy will come soon enough,
and then you'll see.

103
00:13:54,857 --> 00:14:01,421
But we, the Whig Party, simply see this
as just, right and sensible.

104
00:14:01,597 --> 00:14:08,002
Just to bring independence to America.
Right to abolish the slave trade.

105
00:14:09,038 --> 00:14:12,769
And sensible to bring freedom
to the common man,

106
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:17,835
so the blessings of this blessed plot,
this England,

107
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:22,884
may be more equally enjoyed
by all of its inhabitants.

108
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:33,122
I would like to propose a toast
to our host and benefactor

109
00:14:33,229 --> 00:14:38,223
His Grace the Duke
and his beautiful new Duchess.

110
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:40,131
Please be upstanding.

111
00:14:44,974 --> 00:14:50,276
- The Duke and Duchess!
- The Duke and Duchess!

112
00:15:00,055 --> 00:15:01,784
Excellent speech, Mr. Fox.

113
00:15:01,891 --> 00:15:05,088
I thank you. It is always easier
to address a congregation of friends,

114
00:15:05,194 --> 00:15:09,096
particularly when those friends
are drunk.

115
00:15:09,198 --> 00:15:13,100
And how did the Duchess find
Mr. Fox's speech?

116
00:15:13,202 --> 00:15:16,535
I must confess, I am not yet at ease
with political speeches.

117
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,767
Their very form tends to obstruct
my view of their actual meaning,

118
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,968
if such there be.

119
00:15:22,077 --> 00:15:24,011
In which particular section
of the speech

120
00:15:24,113 --> 00:15:26,843
did the message elude Your Grace?

121
00:15:28,517 --> 00:15:31,714
Well, I have great sympathy
with your sentiments in general,

122
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:36,621
but I fail to fully comprehend
how far we, the Whig Party, that is,

123
00:15:36,725 --> 00:15:39,489
are fully committed
to the concept of freedom.

124
00:15:39,628 --> 00:15:42,563
- We intend to extend the vote.
- To all men?

125
00:15:42,665 --> 00:15:47,125
Heavens, no. But certainly to more men.
Freedom in moderation.

126
00:15:47,236 --> 00:15:49,761
- "Freedom in moderation"?
- Precisely.

127
00:15:51,307 --> 00:15:53,867
I'm sure you are
full of the best intentions, Mr. Fox,

128
00:15:53,976 --> 00:15:56,342
but I dare say
I would not spend my vote,

129
00:15:56,445 --> 00:16:01,144
if I had it, of course,
on so vague a statement.

130
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:05,550
One is either free or one is not.
The concept of freedom is an absolute.

131
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:07,815
After all,
one cannot be moderately dead

132
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:12,223
or moderately loved or moderately free.

133
00:16:12,328 --> 00:16:15,229
It must always remain
a matter of either or.

134
00:16:18,734 --> 00:16:21,897
I think it appropriate to say a few words.

135
00:16:22,004 --> 00:16:23,198
When...

136
00:16:47,496 --> 00:16:48,520
Could you check the chamber

137
00:16:48,631 --> 00:16:49,825
- and see if you can find...
- Your Grace.

138
00:16:49,932 --> 00:16:52,423
...different kinds of French lace?

139
00:16:54,837 --> 00:16:58,295
- Is anything the matter?
- No.

140
00:17:00,109 --> 00:17:03,510
- You just left.
- Yes. Well, I had done eating,

141
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:06,240
and those damn speeches
bore me to distraction.

142
00:17:06,348 --> 00:17:08,509
I think we have to ban them
in the future.

143
00:17:08,617 --> 00:17:12,576
But you are the Whigs' main supporter.

144
00:17:12,688 --> 00:17:15,248
Yes. Well,
I've no problem with the politics.

145
00:17:15,357 --> 00:17:17,951
It's just the rhetoric I can't stand.

146
00:17:20,963 --> 00:17:25,923
- Shall I come with you?
- No. I mean, why ever should you?

147
00:17:49,325 --> 00:17:53,056
The Duke is perfectly well.
He simply wanted to rest a while.

148
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:55,062
Do sit down, gentlemen.

149
00:18:02,204 --> 00:18:06,072
Was it the length of the speech
that got the better of the Duke?

150
00:18:06,709 --> 00:18:08,939
Certainly not.

151
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:10,068
He enjoyed it immensely

152
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:13,910
and expressed a hope
that next time it would be even longer.

153
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:19,243
- Your Grace.
- Mr. Fox.

154
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:49,975
- What's going on?
- Nothing to concern you.

155
00:18:51,353 --> 00:18:54,686
- I don't understand.
- Come here.

156
00:19:03,866 --> 00:19:07,563
You look very beautiful tonight.
Is this dress your design?

157
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:13,071
Yes, it is. Thank you.

158
00:19:20,115 --> 00:19:23,414
Then I think you should allow
your husband to appreciate it

159
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,487
in a little more detail.

160
00:19:27,689 --> 00:19:29,020
Come here.

161
00:19:59,888 --> 00:20:03,847
- Yes, send them in.
- Are we having company?

162
00:20:05,127 --> 00:20:08,119
Don't you think
this mutton has a funny taste?

163
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:13,393
- No. Not really, no.
- I think it does.

164
00:20:22,511 --> 00:20:28,939
G, this is Charlotte,
and she will be staying with us.

165
00:20:32,921 --> 00:20:33,979
Why?

166
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:49,967
Because her mother is dead,
and she has no other place to go.

167
00:20:54,076 --> 00:20:56,271
Have you fathered that child?

168
00:20:57,513 --> 00:21:02,382
It's... It's only a little girl, G.
It's hardly the end of the world.

169
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:08,981
- Are you expecting me to look after her?
- We have a house full of vacant rooms.

170
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:11,753
She needn't bother you.
In fact, she may even be of use to you.

171
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,556
You can practice your mothering skills,

172
00:21:16,298 --> 00:21:19,426
until our son arrives.

173
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:24,495
No, this doesn't taste
like normal mutton.

174
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:28,940
I'm sure there is something the matter
with it. Could you take it away?

175
00:21:32,347 --> 00:21:34,713
Does it taste like normal mutton?

176
00:21:36,018 --> 00:21:39,476
Does it taste like normal mutton?
Come here.

177
00:21:41,356 --> 00:21:44,450
Think it tastes like normal mutton,
fussy dog?

178
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,551
Who's a fussy mutton dog?

179
00:21:59,474 --> 00:22:01,533
Does your doll have a name?

180
00:22:06,415 --> 00:22:09,350
I bet you
she loves being in her new bedroom.

181
00:22:12,487 --> 00:22:16,423
You'll have to think of a name
and let me know tomorrow.

182
00:22:16,525 --> 00:22:19,722
Do you think
you'll be able to do that, Charlotte?

183
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:22,994
I...

184
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:26,033
- Would you leave us, please?
- Your Grace.

185
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,307
Hello, Charlotte.

186
00:22:46,421 --> 00:22:48,218
My name is Georgiana.

187
00:23:11,913 --> 00:23:14,404
- Good evening.
- Thank you.

188
00:23:17,886 --> 00:23:19,683
Good evening, ladies.

189
00:23:23,291 --> 00:23:26,351
An inch more and I do believe
Your Grace will explode.

190
00:23:26,461 --> 00:23:29,692
Sheridan always knows
how to pay a compliment.

191
00:23:29,798 --> 00:23:31,356
Still a few more weeks to wait.

192
00:23:31,466 --> 00:23:34,458
A huge belly has never been
more becoming on anyone.

193
00:23:34,569 --> 00:23:38,596
Well, Fox, here, offers an expert opinion
seeing, as he does, a giant belly

194
00:23:38,707 --> 00:23:40,834
every time he passes a mirror.

195
00:23:40,942 --> 00:23:43,604
If your belly were on a woman, well,
we'd all know what to think.

196
00:23:43,712 --> 00:23:47,409
My dear Sheridan,
an hour ago my belly was on a woman.

197
00:23:47,516 --> 00:23:49,279
Now what do you think?

198
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:53,514
That will teach you to insult Mr. Fox
before the gaming has begun.

199
00:23:57,893 --> 00:23:59,417
It's very good.

200
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:08,332
No more bets, please.

201
00:24:15,043 --> 00:24:16,203
Seven.

202
00:24:18,046 --> 00:24:19,843
Her Grace wins again.

203
00:24:22,317 --> 00:24:23,807
Another wager?

204
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,521
- Are you all right, Your Grace?
- Your Grace!

205
00:24:34,629 --> 00:24:37,655
Are those labor pains?
My wife is in labor.

206
00:24:38,366 --> 00:24:39,333
Come along.

207
00:24:39,434 --> 00:24:41,766
I think this calls for a toast.

208
00:24:41,870 --> 00:24:44,703
I may have an heir
before the night is out.

209
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:49,609
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the sixth Duke of Devonshire.

210
00:24:49,711 --> 00:24:52,771
The sixth Duke of Devonshire!

211
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:22,307
- Your Grace.
- I am in no mood for a conversation.

212
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,640
But, pray tell me, is my daughter...

213
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:28,443
Is your daughter at all able
to give me a son?

214
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,074
Take heart, Your Grace.

215
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:31,846
As long as the mother is in good health,

216
00:25:31,953 --> 00:25:33,944
consider this mishap a draft,

217
00:25:34,055 --> 00:25:36,489
a promise of what is soon to come.

218
00:25:37,025 --> 00:25:39,721
- In our family, we...
- Yes, I know, in your family,

219
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:41,455
in your family.

220
00:25:44,666 --> 00:25:46,031
Your Grace.

221
00:25:49,204 --> 00:25:52,640
Can you see the light? Can you see it?

222
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:03,245
- Darling, how are you?
- Quite well.

223
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,922
- Is she strong and healthy?
- She's perfect.

224
00:26:15,063 --> 00:26:17,896
- Did William receive you?
- Yes.

225
00:26:19,534 --> 00:26:21,934
Is he upset that she's not a son?

226
00:26:24,472 --> 00:26:27,839
He just glanced at her and then left.
I've hardly seen him since.

227
00:26:27,943 --> 00:26:29,934
It's been a difficult time for His Grace,
my dear.

228
00:26:30,045 --> 00:26:33,503
Many eyes are upon him
and not all of them kind.

229
00:26:36,885 --> 00:26:38,682
She is the loveliest.

230
00:26:41,389 --> 00:26:43,823
- Nurse?
- No, I will feed her.

231
00:26:43,925 --> 00:26:46,257
- Are you sure, darling?
- Yes.

232
00:26:50,332 --> 00:26:54,564
I am her mother, after all,
even if she is only a girl.

233
00:26:57,405 --> 00:26:58,372
There.

234
00:27:00,075 --> 00:27:01,804
Hell and damnation!

235
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:45,480
It is always a pleasure

236
00:27:45,587 --> 00:27:49,489
when one is on holiday
to request a few words of wisdom.

237
00:27:49,591 --> 00:27:51,183
And so without further ado,

238
00:27:51,293 --> 00:27:55,992
it is a great honor to hand over
to our most distinguished guest.

239
00:27:56,097 --> 00:27:59,123
When she arrives,
all eyes are upon her.

240
00:27:59,234 --> 00:28:03,261
When absent, she is the subject
of universal conversation.

241
00:28:03,371 --> 00:28:05,362
And what we see her wearing tonight,

242
00:28:05,473 --> 00:28:09,432
I look forward to seeing
the rest of you wearing tomorrow!

243
00:28:09,544 --> 00:28:14,641
The empress of fashion herself,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

244
00:28:23,959 --> 00:28:26,587
We come away to Bath
to get away from London,

245
00:28:26,695 --> 00:28:28,890
and all of London
has come away to Bath.

246
00:28:30,565 --> 00:28:32,362
Somebody did indeed ask me

247
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:34,958
what kind of feather it is
that I'm wearing.

248
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:39,097
Well, there are only two specimens
of this rare bird known to man.

249
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:43,473
One of them has clearly ended up
on top of my head.

250
00:28:43,578 --> 00:28:47,844
And the other, rumor has it,
is running for office in the Tory Party.

251
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,839
Bess Foster.

252
00:29:24,886 --> 00:29:26,217
Excuse me.

253
00:30:01,823 --> 00:30:07,557
- I don't believe we've been introduced.
- No, we haven't. Lady Elizabeth Foster.

254
00:30:07,662 --> 00:30:12,190
- I saw you talking with my husband.
- Yes. He wanted to dance.

255
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:18,395
That's not usually considered his forte.
And you declined?

256
00:30:19,641 --> 00:30:22,804
I'm ill at ease with male company
for the moment.

257
00:30:26,047 --> 00:30:27,378
Thank you.

258
00:30:28,383 --> 00:30:30,476
So what brings you to Bath?

259
00:30:33,621 --> 00:30:37,318
My husband, Mr. Foster,
is enjoying his mistress in Bournemouth

260
00:30:37,425 --> 00:30:40,394
and I wanted some diversion. And you?

261
00:30:43,731 --> 00:30:46,564
The Duke is taking the waters
for his gout.

262
00:30:47,869 --> 00:30:50,064
- And I for my health.
- Really?

263
00:30:51,005 --> 00:30:54,406
I heard you were here
because you could not conceive a son.

264
00:30:54,509 --> 00:30:58,843
I beg your pardon,
that was an awful thing to say.

265
00:30:58,947 --> 00:31:00,642
It was the truth, at least.

266
00:31:00,748 --> 00:31:03,376
Trust me to say something silly.
I always do, you know.

267
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:06,420
Then perhaps you should
have accepted the Duke's offer.

268
00:31:06,521 --> 00:31:08,489
You have much in common.

269
00:31:20,468 --> 00:31:23,096
Home, I think, Georgiana.

270
00:31:31,846 --> 00:31:35,373
- Where are you staying?
- I've rented some rooms in town.

271
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:39,018
- We must meet again.
- We must.

272
00:31:55,937 --> 00:31:59,873
Harryo. Come here. Come here.
Did that hurt?

273
00:31:59,974 --> 00:32:02,465
- Mama.
- My angel.

274
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:07,744
Are you sore? Was that sore?
Let me have a look. Was it this knee?

275
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:10,947
I think you shall live.

276
00:32:11,052 --> 00:32:15,546
Right. First to the bridge on my count.
One, two, three. Go.

277
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:16,885
Come on, Harryo.

278
00:32:16,991 --> 00:32:20,154
- No, I'm gonna catch her!
- I'm gonna catch you!

279
00:32:20,261 --> 00:32:24,459
Up and down. Up and down.
Why can't we recover like that?

280
00:32:24,566 --> 00:32:26,534
It's too far to fall now.

281
00:32:26,634 --> 00:32:30,126
- Hello again.
- Hello. Your girls are lovely.

282
00:32:30,238 --> 00:32:35,232
- Thank you. Do you have any children?
- I do. Three boys.

283
00:32:36,177 --> 00:32:37,974
Three boys.

284
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:40,980
What the Duke wouldn't give
for one of them.

285
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:49,522
- She is least like you, your eldest.
- Yes. I'm sure you know the story.

286
00:32:53,728 --> 00:32:57,095
My husband's daughter was born
before we married.

287
00:32:57,198 --> 00:33:01,157
Her mother was a maid.
The maid died, and we took the child.

288
00:33:01,269 --> 00:33:04,136
- I'm sorry. Have I spoken out of turn?
- No.

289
00:33:04,239 --> 00:33:07,936
It's the worst-kept secret in London.
She's nine years old now.

290
00:33:08,042 --> 00:33:09,771
And you love her?

291
00:33:09,877 --> 00:33:12,778
Of course I do.
The same as all my children.

292
00:33:16,317 --> 00:33:18,581
Come and meet them.

293
00:33:18,686 --> 00:33:22,417
Girls. Come and meet my new friend,
Lady Elizabeth.

294
00:33:29,163 --> 00:33:32,792
- Your Grace.
- Thank you. Thermal water.

295
00:33:34,836 --> 00:33:36,736
It's the sulfur
that makes it smell so bad.

296
00:33:36,838 --> 00:33:40,672
- And you really have to drink it?
- Twice a day for four weeks.

297
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:46,171
Do you have any reason to believe
you cannot birth a male?

298
00:33:46,281 --> 00:33:49,808
No. Except miscarriages.

299
00:33:52,053 --> 00:33:54,180
Two stillbirths, both sons.

300
00:33:57,225 --> 00:33:59,090
But two healthy girls.

301
00:34:09,304 --> 00:34:11,431
Everybody is staring at you.

302
00:34:16,611 --> 00:34:20,911
What's that on your neck? Bess?

303
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:26,284
It's not illegal for a man
to beat his wife with a stick

304
00:34:26,387 --> 00:34:29,379
unless the stick is thicker
than his thumb.

305
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:33,449
Mr. Foster? But he can't have done that!

306
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:36,155
Well, considering what else
he's done to me, that's not the worst.

307
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:37,697
What could possibly be worse?

308
00:34:37,799 --> 00:34:40,962
He's taken my children.
He won't let me see them.

309
00:34:47,342 --> 00:34:51,676
- And what do you propose to do?
- Really, I'm at my wits' end.

310
00:34:54,082 --> 00:34:56,209
The law supports Mr. Foster.

311
00:34:58,853 --> 00:35:01,845
In the meantime, where shall you stay?

312
00:35:01,956 --> 00:35:04,754
Continue lodging,
till the money runs out.

313
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,663
Well, there, at least, I think I can help.

314
00:35:19,006 --> 00:35:21,338
William? We leave tomorrow.

315
00:35:24,245 --> 00:35:28,443
And Lady Elizabeth doesn't have
to meet her parents on the continent

316
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:30,744
for some time.

317
00:35:30,852 --> 00:35:35,721
- She hardly ever visits London at all.
- It's a pity, that.

318
00:35:38,593 --> 00:35:41,426
You see,
she doesn't have anywhere to stay.

319
00:35:44,432 --> 00:35:45,922
Problem there.

320
00:35:48,569 --> 00:35:53,097
Well, why doesn't she stay with us?
For a while, at least.

321
00:35:55,443 --> 00:35:56,774
Thank you.

322
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:05,183
- This is incredible.
- There's the castle in Ireland.

323
00:36:05,286 --> 00:36:10,588
Bolton Abbey, Chiswick, Burlington
and, why, in Chatsworth, of course.

324
00:36:10,691 --> 00:36:13,683
- Of course.
- Which is much bigger.

325
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:15,888
But this is more like home.

326
00:36:20,735 --> 00:36:23,260
I'm so glad you're here.

327
00:36:23,371 --> 00:36:26,067
I've arranged a wonderful start
to the season.

328
00:36:30,378 --> 00:36:34,280
May all the plagues of marriage
be doubled on me

329
00:36:34,382 --> 00:36:39,581
if ever I try to be friends
with you anymore!

330
00:36:39,687 --> 00:36:41,416
So much the better.

331
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:48,751
No, no, madam.
'Tis evident you care not a pin for me!

332
00:36:49,297 --> 00:36:53,563
And I, I was a madman to marry you.

333
00:36:53,668 --> 00:36:58,002
And I'm sure I was a fool to marry you,

334
00:36:58,105 --> 00:37:01,472
an old dangling bachelor

335
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:06,575
who was single at 50

336
00:37:06,681 --> 00:37:10,742
only because he never could meet
with anyone who could have him!

337
00:37:32,473 --> 00:37:36,341
Bess, may I introduce Mr. Fox,
leader of the Opposition?

338
00:37:36,444 --> 00:37:39,845
- Mr. Fox, Lady Elizabeth Foster.
- Mr. Fox.

339
00:37:39,947 --> 00:37:44,043
- My protégé, Charles Grey.
- Mr. Grey.

340
00:37:44,151 --> 00:37:45,778
- Mr. Grey.
- Your Grace.

341
00:37:45,887 --> 00:37:48,321
He's our newest bright young man.

342
00:37:48,422 --> 00:37:52,256
Scarcely out of Cambridge
and already a member of Parliament.

343
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:56,394
- I always felt you'd do well.
- Thank you.

344
00:37:56,497 --> 00:37:58,727
- Mr. Fox.
- Yes, Lady Elizabeth.

345
00:37:59,734 --> 00:38:05,730
- Did you enjoy the play?
- I must confess, I did not entirely.

346
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:09,540
I hope that you've not lost
your sense of humor

347
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:12,204
- since entering politics.
- Not that I'm aware.

348
00:38:12,313 --> 00:38:13,905
<i>Then I'm sure you realize
that School for Scandal</i>

349
00:38:14,015 --> 00:38:17,041
- was written as a comedy.
- Yes.

350
00:38:17,151 --> 00:38:21,144
Although, from where I sat,
it read as a tragedy.

351
00:38:21,255 --> 00:38:25,191
Your Grace! How we have missed you.

352
00:38:25,293 --> 00:38:26,282
In your absence,

353
00:38:26,394 --> 00:38:29,124
London has been reduced
to the dreariest province.

354
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:31,960
And this, of course,
is the playwright Mr. Sheridan.

355
00:38:32,066 --> 00:38:34,364
May I present
the Lady Elizabeth Foster?

356
00:38:34,468 --> 00:38:35,594
I do not mean to be rude,

357
00:38:35,703 --> 00:38:37,864
but I've an entire cast
dying to meet the Duchess.

358
00:38:37,972 --> 00:38:40,702
I shall return you in a moment. Promise.

359
00:38:43,511 --> 00:38:44,478
- Mr. Fox?
- Yes.

360
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:45,603
A word.

361
00:38:45,713 --> 00:38:50,343
Well, wherever do I glean
such domestic gossip?

362
00:38:50,451 --> 00:38:53,545
- Were we fair on the Duke?
- It could have been worse.

363
00:38:53,654 --> 00:38:56,350
<i>My original title was The Bad Marriage.</i>

364
00:39:00,328 --> 00:39:02,626
Is it always like this?

365
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:04,527
Well, as they say,

366
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:06,862
the Duke of Devonshire
must be the only man in England

367
00:39:06,968 --> 00:39:08,868
not in love with his wife.

368
00:39:10,738 --> 00:39:13,036
- Her Grace, the Duchess of Devonshire.
- Very pleased to meet you.

369
00:39:21,882 --> 00:39:24,942
Were you at all able to forget things
and enjoy yourself?

370
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:28,988
It was a wonderful distraction,
thank you.

371
00:39:29,090 --> 00:39:30,182
Good.

372
00:39:33,794 --> 00:39:37,195
- I talked to Mr. Grey all evening.
- Yes?

373
00:39:39,233 --> 00:39:40,723
He's in love with you.

374
00:39:40,835 --> 00:39:45,898
My dear Bess, no, he is not.
Quite the reverse, I fear.

375
00:39:46,007 --> 00:39:49,704
Well, can't you tell
by the way he looks at you?

376
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,745
- Honestly, can't you tell?
- Stop it.

377
00:39:55,249 --> 00:39:59,709
Georgiana,
intercourse is not just about offspring.

378
00:40:01,422 --> 00:40:06,621
- In fact, it can be rather pleasurable.
- Yes, I know.

379
00:40:09,497 --> 00:40:14,366
Close your eyes
and try to envisage Grey

380
00:40:14,468 --> 00:40:18,598
opening your dress, kissing your back.

381
00:40:18,706 --> 00:40:21,698
- They never do such things.
- Yes, they do.

382
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,942
Close your eyes.

383
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:41,189
Grey is behind you
slowly opening your dress.

384
00:40:41,295 --> 00:40:43,695
- No, Bess, stop!
- Close your eyes.

385
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:01,908
Kissing your back.

386
00:41:24,905 --> 00:41:26,065
There.

387
00:41:27,341 --> 00:41:28,638
See?

388
00:42:10,242 --> 00:42:12,437
- Would you excuse me for a minute?
- You must excuse me, gentlemen.

389
00:42:12,544 --> 00:42:14,978
- Your Grace.
- Mr. Grey.

390
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:17,708
The national election
is in six weeks, yes?

391
00:42:17,816 --> 00:42:19,841
How is the campaign going?

392
00:42:22,721 --> 00:42:23,949
Terribly.

393
00:42:25,090 --> 00:42:28,582
Our only hope
is to save Westminster for Fox.

394
00:42:28,693 --> 00:42:30,923
I have many faults, as you well know.

395
00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:34,658
Not least among them
is my ability to draw attention.

396
00:42:35,801 --> 00:42:38,634
Perhaps we could use that
to our advantage.

397
00:42:54,719 --> 00:42:56,516
Ladies and gentlemen.

398
00:42:58,223 --> 00:43:01,215
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you the man

399
00:43:01,326 --> 00:43:04,022
who will inform us
of the work we must do

400
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:08,759
and of the party we so believe in.
Mr. Charles Grey.

401
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:20,075
Good people of Westminster!

402
00:43:20,178 --> 00:43:25,480
The world is on the brink of disaster
or salvation!

403
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:27,245
From France to America,

404
00:43:27,352 --> 00:43:30,344
men and women are struggling
to free themselves,

405
00:43:30,455 --> 00:43:33,856
to find meaning in their existence!

406
00:43:33,959 --> 00:43:36,450
Change is upon us!

407
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:41,626
We shall not go back to the old ways.

408
00:43:41,733 --> 00:43:46,898
We shall take England
into this brave new world

409
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:49,803
and shake the thunder from the skies!

410
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:07,587
- How did I do?
- I think it was not an embarrassment.

411
00:44:09,094 --> 00:44:11,324
It was a marvel.

412
00:44:11,429 --> 00:44:15,422
I was nervous. Your presence
trebled the numbers at least.

413
00:44:19,437 --> 00:44:21,234
I'm nervous even now.

414
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:27,277
If we win this election,
if we get the power,

415
00:44:27,379 --> 00:44:29,347
think what we will do.

416
00:44:29,447 --> 00:44:32,245
Do you think of me
when we're not together?

417
00:44:33,451 --> 00:44:36,943
You ought to know I do.

418
00:44:37,055 --> 00:44:39,683
- You hesitated before you replied.
- No.

419
00:44:49,501 --> 00:44:52,129
I'm unused to being asked so directly.

420
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:57,565
And by you, of all people.

421
00:45:00,679 --> 00:45:05,116
I think of you all the time. I always have.

422
00:45:11,790 --> 00:45:14,782
- Your carriage awaits, Your Grace.
- Thank you.

423
00:45:16,728 --> 00:45:19,060
...this we vow!

424
00:45:46,458 --> 00:45:49,621
What are you doing outside
Lady Elizabeth's room?

425
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,968
Who's in there with her?

426
00:47:03,232 --> 00:47:09,228
Of all the women in England
you had to throw yourself on her.

427
00:47:13,442 --> 00:47:18,971
I have never once objected
to any of your affairs.

428
00:47:21,283 --> 00:47:25,344
I have accepted whatever arrangement
you have proposed.

429
00:47:26,989 --> 00:47:30,652
I have raised Charlotte
as my own daughter.

430
00:47:33,696 --> 00:47:35,061
But this...

431
00:47:38,167 --> 00:47:42,297
I have one single thing of my own.

432
00:47:45,541 --> 00:47:48,738
Why couldn't you let me keep Elizabeth
for myself?

433
00:47:51,146 --> 00:47:53,774
What kind of man are you?

434
00:47:56,919 --> 00:48:02,619
She is my sole comfort in our marriage.
You have robbed me of my only friend!

435
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:13,966
What is wrong with me?

436
00:48:39,361 --> 00:48:40,419
I...

437
00:48:42,464 --> 00:48:48,835
I've never claimed
to be a man of fine sensibility, G.

438
00:48:48,937 --> 00:48:52,202
But I've always known
what I expect from this marriage

439
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:54,537
and what I'm prepared to give.

440
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:59,804
As a husband,
I have fulfilled my obligations.

441
00:48:59,915 --> 00:49:03,180
But, as a wife,

442
00:49:05,554 --> 00:49:07,681
you have not.

443
00:49:07,790 --> 00:49:11,191
She has to go. Now.

444
00:49:11,293 --> 00:49:13,887
She is never to set foot
in this house again!

445
00:49:13,996 --> 00:49:15,930
Do mind your temper, G.
You're forgetting yourself.

446
00:49:17,399 --> 00:49:18,923
I want her out.

447
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:25,903
I never want to lay eyes on her again.
Go down and tell her to leave at once.

448
00:49:30,512 --> 00:49:32,446
I couldn't ask her that.

449
00:49:35,117 --> 00:49:36,744
I won't do it, G.

450
00:49:54,036 --> 00:49:59,235
- I never liked her from the first.
- You made that quite clear, Mama.

451
00:49:59,341 --> 00:50:02,071
She's gone from Devonshire House,
I hope.

452
00:50:06,148 --> 00:50:08,139
They're living there together?

453
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,582
Georgiana!
What have you permitted to happen?

454
00:50:10,686 --> 00:50:14,315
I don't know. I don't know.

455
00:50:14,423 --> 00:50:18,120
Help me. Help me, please, Mama.
Tell me what to do.

456
00:50:22,631 --> 00:50:26,727
You must write to your husband
and insist he send her back

457
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:28,996
to whatever horrid little place
she came from.

458
00:50:29,104 --> 00:50:33,871
He will not.
"It is out of the question," he says.

459
00:50:39,615 --> 00:50:43,449
Then you must return
and resume your duties.

460
00:50:43,552 --> 00:50:46,077
Make him realize whom he loves.

461
00:50:46,188 --> 00:50:48,952
You will give up your politics
and your gambling.

462
00:50:49,057 --> 00:50:52,356
For once,
you will devote yourself as a loving wife

463
00:50:52,461 --> 00:50:56,420
and settle down to the task in hand,
providing him with an heir.

464
00:50:57,833 --> 00:51:00,063
Then he will soon tire of her.

465
00:51:08,877 --> 00:51:10,868
You have no other option.

466
00:51:49,818 --> 00:51:51,115
Hello, G.

467
00:51:53,388 --> 00:51:54,616
William.

468
00:52:28,056 --> 00:52:32,049
I may not have the authority
to remove you from my house,

469
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,788
but I can, at least,
order you out of my room.

470
00:52:34,896 --> 00:52:37,262
Won't you please let me explain?

471
00:52:38,867 --> 00:52:39,925
There is nothing to explain.

472
00:52:40,035 --> 00:52:43,527
This is my only chance
of ever seeing my children again.

473
00:52:44,806 --> 00:52:47,001
The Duke is the most powerful peer
in England.

474
00:52:47,109 --> 00:52:48,337
He is my only chance.

475
00:52:48,443 --> 00:52:52,379
There are limits to the sacrifices
one makes for one's children.

476
00:52:52,481 --> 00:52:56,577
No, there aren't. No limits whatsoever.

477
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:00,949
Get out.

478
00:53:04,893 --> 00:53:07,862
We have nothing more
to say to one another.

479
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:02,113
Mama, Mama!

480
00:54:09,524 --> 00:54:12,084
It's so nice to see you, Mama.

481
00:54:12,194 --> 00:54:14,754
Right, this is a shotgun.

482
00:54:14,863 --> 00:54:16,797
Your mother said
you'd be interested, yes?

483
00:54:16,898 --> 00:54:17,922
Yes.

484
00:54:19,534 --> 00:54:21,229
This is a flint. Do you see?

485
00:54:21,336 --> 00:54:24,362
When the flint hits there,
it causes a spark to happen.

486
00:54:24,473 --> 00:54:30,343
Now, the spark, it lights the gunpowder
and sends the bullet out of the gun.

487
00:54:30,445 --> 00:54:32,572
- Do you know how to hold it?
- No, sir.

488
00:54:32,681 --> 00:54:38,085
Well, it's like that.
Tuck it in there, into your right shoulder.

489
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,849
Hold it firmly, then you can move
that hand a little further along.

490
00:54:41,957 --> 00:54:45,984
Can you feel how heavy it is?
You have to lean into it a bit.

491
00:54:46,094 --> 00:54:50,053
And keep both eyes open.
Look right along the barrel.

492
00:54:50,165 --> 00:54:52,531
Right along there just like that.

493
00:54:54,503 --> 00:54:58,405
Bang! Here, let me show you.

494
00:55:02,110 --> 00:55:03,441
There.

495
00:55:04,346 --> 00:55:06,473
It's quite heavy, isn't it?

496
00:55:07,816 --> 00:55:11,809
Are you thirsty?
Would you like something to drink?

497
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:15,447
Are you gentlemen thirsty?
Would you like something to drink?

498
00:55:17,692 --> 00:55:19,023
Thank you.

499
00:56:12,848 --> 00:56:14,975
Did you tell the Duke
who you were meeting?

500
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:16,107
No.

501
00:56:16,985 --> 00:56:18,919
- Did he even ask?
- No.

502
00:56:20,055 --> 00:56:22,216
He has other things on his mind.

503
00:56:23,925 --> 00:56:25,324
As do you.

504
00:56:29,764 --> 00:56:32,232
Would it help to unburden yourself?

505
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:37,494
It's nothing I can discuss with you.

506
00:56:39,407 --> 00:56:41,500
Besides, it would only bore.

507
00:56:42,444 --> 00:56:45,379
You don't have to please others
all the time.

508
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:49,507
It's what I've been brought up to do.
Difficult lesson to unlearn.

509
00:56:53,088 --> 00:56:55,556
Would you permit me an observation?

510
00:56:59,861 --> 00:57:02,989
I believe you do it
so that people will love you.

511
00:57:03,832 --> 00:57:06,892
- What makes you say that?
- From what I've seen.

512
00:57:08,637 --> 00:57:13,665
With your husband, your friends,
especially Lady Bess,

513
00:57:15,911 --> 00:57:17,503
even the public.

514
00:57:19,648 --> 00:57:22,242
I never thought of it that way before.

515
00:57:24,219 --> 00:57:26,414
You make me sound so pitiable.

516
00:57:32,294 --> 00:57:33,591
Georgiana.

517
00:57:35,830 --> 00:57:39,596
I've gone beyond my brief. I apologize.

518
00:57:41,503 --> 00:57:44,904
Please believe
it was only for your sake that I spoke.

519
00:57:46,207 --> 00:57:48,402
Please, tell me what is wrong.

520
00:57:53,014 --> 00:57:56,848
I fear I've done
some things in life too late

521
00:57:56,952 --> 00:57:58,783
and others too early.

522
00:58:03,425 --> 00:58:05,017
No, you haven't.

523
00:58:20,609 --> 00:58:21,940
I'm sorry.

524
00:58:59,948 --> 00:59:01,279
Thank you.

525
00:59:17,966 --> 00:59:19,297
All right.

526
00:59:22,637 --> 00:59:24,002
"All right"?

527
00:59:27,542 --> 00:59:29,442
Do you love each other?

528
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:36,310
- Georgiana...
- Do you love Bess, Your Grace?

529
00:59:37,986 --> 00:59:41,478
- Where is all this leading?
- I make no demands on him.

530
00:59:43,825 --> 00:59:47,886
- And, Bess, do you love my husband?
- As I do you.

531
00:59:50,965 --> 00:59:52,990
And so you intend to stay?

532
00:59:56,037 --> 00:59:58,130
William has asked that I do.

533
00:59:59,541 --> 01:00:02,704
You couldn't find it in your heart
to refuse him?

534
01:00:04,946 --> 01:00:06,038
No.

535
01:00:10,385 --> 01:00:12,311
Then let us make a deal.

536
01:00:13,254 --> 01:00:15,882
- A deal?
- Yes.

537
01:00:18,727 --> 01:00:21,924
I give you my blessing

538
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:25,898
if you will accept my feelings
for Charles Grey.

539
01:00:28,436 --> 01:00:30,028
I didn't realize it at first.

540
01:00:30,138 --> 01:00:33,665
I thought that perhaps
it was only a dalliance.

541
01:00:35,143 --> 01:00:36,940
It can make me happy.

542
01:00:41,850 --> 01:00:44,648
A deal? A deal.

543
01:00:46,221 --> 01:00:47,984
I don't make deals.

544
01:00:49,124 --> 01:00:50,557
Why would I?

545
01:00:53,094 --> 01:00:54,288
I'm in charge of it all.

546
01:00:54,395 --> 01:00:58,957
You know, I would call him out.
I would challenge him.

547
01:00:59,067 --> 01:01:00,694
- I'd put a bullet in his head.
- William.

548
01:01:00,802 --> 01:01:04,898
Be quiet. Are you determined
to make me a total laughingstock?

549
01:01:05,006 --> 01:01:07,736
A man who cannot sire a son,
and then a cuckold?

550
01:01:07,842 --> 01:01:10,003
William. Georgiana only asks
what we ourselves...

551
01:01:10,111 --> 01:01:11,703
Be quiet, woman!

552
01:01:13,848 --> 01:01:16,408
- Are you his whore?
- No.

553
01:01:17,685 --> 01:01:19,846
But I can't see why you'd mind.

554
01:01:19,954 --> 01:01:23,355
- You have Bess and three boys!
- Three boys?

555
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,654
Do you think
I can make those bastards my heirs?

556
01:01:30,498 --> 01:01:32,329
Well? Do you?

557
01:01:42,510 --> 01:01:43,772
William!

558
01:02:16,044 --> 01:02:18,035
You don't know me in the least, do you?

559
01:02:18,146 --> 01:02:19,943
Yes, I do. We're a bad match.

560
01:02:20,048 --> 01:02:24,246
I asked but two things when we wed,
loyalty and a male heir.

561
01:02:24,352 --> 01:02:26,718
The same as your dogs!

562
01:02:30,859 --> 01:02:34,852
No, don't touch me! Don't touch me!

563
01:02:37,899 --> 01:02:39,196
Get off!

564
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,836
Get off me!

565
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:51,275
Is this how you treat her?
Is this how you treat your whore?

566
01:02:51,379 --> 01:02:53,404
No! No!

567
01:02:54,582 --> 01:02:57,608
No! No! No!

568
01:02:58,486 --> 01:02:59,748
No!

569
01:03:03,925 --> 01:03:06,519
Come with me.
Charlotte, come with me.

570
01:03:07,695 --> 01:03:09,322
No! No!

571
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:38,155
Give me a son.
Until then, stay here and do as I say.

572
01:03:54,642 --> 01:04:00,581
I give you the winner.
Mr. Fox, the man of the people!

573
01:04:07,455 --> 01:04:13,291
And I give you the weapon,
the Duchess of Devonshire.

574
01:04:25,340 --> 01:04:26,932
Thank you.

575
01:04:27,041 --> 01:04:31,569
Thank you, all of you,
for this reception today.

576
01:04:33,581 --> 01:04:39,952
Today we have won the vote.
Tomorrow we define the future!

577
01:04:52,233 --> 01:04:54,201
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

578
01:04:57,739 --> 01:04:59,934
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

579
01:05:03,311 --> 01:05:04,608
Your Grace.

580
01:05:10,718 --> 01:05:12,208
- Your Grace.
- Your Grace.

581
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:35,741
Will Your Grace give me
the favor of a dance?

582
01:05:59,534 --> 01:06:00,865
Steady, G.

583
01:06:05,673 --> 01:06:08,198
- Fire!
- Georgiana!

584
01:06:09,277 --> 01:06:10,335
Your Grace!

585
01:06:10,812 --> 01:06:12,302
Her Grace's hair!

586
01:06:15,283 --> 01:06:16,614
Do something!

587
01:06:28,396 --> 01:06:30,762
Please put out Her Grace's hair.

588
01:07:06,534 --> 01:07:08,559
Her Grace needs to rest.

589
01:07:08,669 --> 01:07:10,728
As long as she follows
strict instructions

590
01:07:10,838 --> 01:07:13,807
there should be no impediment
to the birth.

591
01:07:13,908 --> 01:07:15,967
What are you talking about?

592
01:07:16,944 --> 01:07:19,003
The Duchess is pregnant.

593
01:07:50,311 --> 01:07:51,642
And there.

594
01:07:55,016 --> 01:07:56,643
Thank you, Heaton.

595
01:08:00,555 --> 01:08:01,749
Come.

596
01:08:13,935 --> 01:08:15,300
Your Grace.

597
01:08:16,938 --> 01:08:21,466
As per the terms of
His Grace's inheritance, this is for you

598
01:08:22,543 --> 01:08:24,340
to spend as you wish.

599
01:08:29,016 --> 01:08:30,643
Success at last.

600
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:40,657
Georgiana.

601
01:08:42,964 --> 01:08:45,990
I, too, abhor this whole thing.

602
01:09:05,453 --> 01:09:06,977
Twist or stick?

603
01:09:08,422 --> 01:09:10,720
- Stick.
- Stick?

604
01:09:11,692 --> 01:09:13,523
I'll stick, too, then.

605
01:09:15,429 --> 01:09:16,794
Let's see.

606
01:09:17,665 --> 01:09:19,394
You won. Well done.

607
01:09:20,468 --> 01:09:21,696
Come on.

608
01:09:24,372 --> 01:09:25,566
Come on.

609
01:09:27,608 --> 01:09:28,666
Come on.

610
01:09:34,515 --> 01:09:36,540
Mama, you forgot to deal.

611
01:09:56,070 --> 01:09:58,561
- Your Grace.
- Mr. Grey.

612
01:10:00,608 --> 01:10:03,668
- You are recalled from France?
- For a while.

613
01:10:03,778 --> 01:10:05,405
No revolution yet?

614
01:10:06,881 --> 01:10:09,748
No, not yet,
but it's only a matter of time.

615
01:10:12,420 --> 01:10:16,516
- How is it you are here?
- I received an invitation.

616
01:10:18,359 --> 01:10:22,489
I assumed it was on behalf of the Party.
I could not say no.

617
01:10:22,630 --> 01:10:23,961
Of course.

618
01:10:31,305 --> 01:10:32,772
I bore a son.

619
01:10:35,576 --> 01:10:36,702
Yes.

620
01:10:39,013 --> 01:10:42,574
His name is
William George Spencer Cavendish,

621
01:10:42,683 --> 01:10:47,382
Marquis of Hartington.
We call him Hart.

622
01:10:47,488 --> 01:10:49,752
You and the Duke must be very pleased.

623
01:10:49,857 --> 01:10:51,119
We are.

624
01:10:55,096 --> 01:10:57,860
The Duke has gone to London
to celebrate.

625
01:11:03,904 --> 01:11:05,667
You have been missed.

626
01:11:08,609 --> 01:11:10,042
Much missed.

627
01:11:17,284 --> 01:11:19,411
- Ten on the Queen.
- Four on five.

628
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,488
And no more bets, please.

629
01:11:24,492 --> 01:11:27,586
The losing card, four.

630
01:11:30,664 --> 01:11:33,360
The winning card, Queen.

631
01:11:59,693 --> 01:12:02,093
Jolly good. Eight on the three.

632
01:12:02,196 --> 01:12:03,959
Put five on the five.

633
01:12:06,033 --> 01:12:08,263
All of the fives have gone, G.

634
01:12:11,572 --> 01:12:13,767
I think I'm too tired to play.

635
01:12:16,844 --> 01:12:19,108
- Gentlemen.
- Your Grace.

636
01:12:31,058 --> 01:12:32,389
Georgiana.

637
01:12:34,295 --> 01:12:35,956
No one must know.

638
01:12:37,364 --> 01:12:40,162
- You summoned Grey.
- Good night.

639
01:14:54,605 --> 01:14:57,073
I was thinking about going to Bath.

640
01:15:01,178 --> 01:15:07,674
Bess, you can stay here and look after
our husband whilst I take the cure.

641
01:15:09,487 --> 01:15:11,853
Yes, William. Why not?

642
01:15:11,956 --> 01:15:15,551
If G goes now, we can catch up with her
when you're free.

643
01:15:16,761 --> 01:15:18,456
Well, if you must.

644
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:35,672
"The Duchess of Devonshire appeared
last week in Bath in a mobcap.

645
01:15:36,714 --> 01:15:39,945
"Her Grace, ever since initiation
into the business of electioneering,

646
01:15:40,051 --> 01:15:41,916
"has been much attached to the mobs."

647
01:15:42,019 --> 01:15:43,646
Very good.

648
01:15:47,358 --> 01:15:49,588
So which one is your favorite?

649
01:15:52,797 --> 01:15:54,992
- This one.
- Yeah.

650
01:15:57,234 --> 01:16:00,465
In this one it seems
you've hit a winning streak, for once.

651
01:16:00,571 --> 01:16:01,936
Very good.

652
01:16:04,742 --> 01:16:07,267
And in this one you see...

653
01:16:07,378 --> 01:16:11,178
Is that dress really an appropriate way
to attract voters?

654
01:16:11,282 --> 01:16:14,718
You politicians know absolutely nothing
about fashion.

655
01:16:16,220 --> 01:16:19,656
But if you were to really ask me
which my favorite was,

656
01:16:21,459 --> 01:16:23,427
I'd say it was this one.

657
01:16:38,042 --> 01:16:40,135
- Morning, Charles.
- Morning.

658
01:16:40,244 --> 01:16:41,677
Good day to you, sir.

659
01:17:07,338 --> 01:17:10,000
It's perfect. Thank you.

660
01:17:35,533 --> 01:17:37,899
Thought we would surprise you, G.

661
01:17:38,035 --> 01:17:40,868
I think you once said there wasn't
enough spontaneity in our marriage

662
01:17:40,971 --> 01:17:42,939
or words to that effect.

663
01:17:46,477 --> 01:17:48,707
Mama, what are you doing here?

664
01:17:50,347 --> 01:17:54,716
So, have you seen
many of our circle in Bath?

665
01:17:56,487 --> 01:17:57,613
Some.

666
01:17:58,923 --> 01:18:04,259
The Cokes and Haverford
and Lord Wicklow.

667
01:18:04,361 --> 01:18:07,888
Bunch of politicos, too, aren't there?
Meetings and such.

668
01:18:08,899 --> 01:18:09,888
I believe.

669
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:14,437
Is Grey here?
By which I mean Mr. Charles Grey.

670
01:18:15,372 --> 01:18:17,499
Rumor has it that he is.

671
01:18:17,608 --> 01:18:19,337
- I won't give him up.
- Georgiana.

672
01:18:19,443 --> 01:18:22,606
Everyone has a lover.
Bess is the lover of my husband.

673
01:18:22,713 --> 01:18:24,374
If you had shown some discretion,

674
01:18:24,481 --> 01:18:26,881
- it might have been different.
- Different?

675
01:18:26,984 --> 01:18:29,418
The only good fortune is
it hasn't yet made it to the papers.

676
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:33,354
My dear, Grey is unmarried.
He has no wealth, no rank.

677
01:18:33,457 --> 01:18:36,893
He risks nothing with this affair.
The hazard is all yours.

678
01:18:36,994 --> 01:18:39,827
- Grey loves me.
- So does William.

679
01:18:39,930 --> 01:18:43,331
Yes. I love you.

680
01:18:44,969 --> 01:18:46,197
How?

681
01:18:48,005 --> 01:18:50,599
In the way I understand love.

682
01:18:53,644 --> 01:18:58,343
Georgiana, this has gone much too far.
It is beneath our dignity.

683
01:18:58,449 --> 01:19:00,815
- All London is talking.
- Let them talk.

684
01:19:00,918 --> 01:19:03,443
If Grey makes me a fallen woman,
well and good.

685
01:19:03,554 --> 01:19:06,045
Now William may divorce me and
Bess becomes Duchess of Devonshire.

686
01:19:06,156 --> 01:19:08,021
That will never happen.

687
01:19:10,227 --> 01:19:12,559
I think I will leave you to it.

688
01:19:18,102 --> 01:19:20,297
What follows now?

689
01:19:20,404 --> 01:19:23,669
Are you going to tear my clothes off
and force yourself upon me again?

690
01:19:23,774 --> 01:19:25,969
Why on earth would I do that?

691
01:19:26,877 --> 01:19:32,144
I know that you've never thought much
of my manners or my intellect, G.

692
01:19:33,217 --> 01:19:37,381
But, in fact, I never do anything
that serves no purpose.

693
01:19:37,488 --> 01:19:40,355
I know precisely
what you two have together.

694
01:19:40,457 --> 01:19:42,288
- We love each other.
- I do not doubt it.

695
01:19:42,393 --> 01:19:44,088
He is a dreamer like yourself,

696
01:19:44,194 --> 01:19:48,790
and you both dream of another world
that does not exist and it never will.

697
01:19:48,899 --> 01:19:52,528
As for reality, allow me to enlighten you.

698
01:19:53,737 --> 01:19:57,537
If you do not give him up at once,
I will see to it

699
01:19:57,641 --> 01:20:02,101
that every home and every checkbook
in this country is closed to him.

700
01:20:02,212 --> 01:20:05,045
He will be welcomed
neither in the halls of government

701
01:20:05,149 --> 01:20:07,743
nor in its backrooms of power.

702
01:20:07,851 --> 01:20:10,649
His dream of becoming prime minister

703
01:20:10,788 --> 01:20:17,125
and your mutual fantasy
of a changed world will be dead as ash.

704
01:20:21,098 --> 01:20:23,965
And you will never
see your children again.

705
01:20:33,477 --> 01:20:34,808
Georgiana.

706
01:21:20,190 --> 01:21:22,522
I must ask you to return to London.

707
01:21:22,626 --> 01:21:24,594
- Without you?
- Yes.

708
01:21:33,103 --> 01:21:35,503
These are from our girls.

709
01:21:35,606 --> 01:21:39,872
Little Hart neglected to write,
but then, of course, he's not yet one.

710
01:21:51,388 --> 01:21:55,347
- This will be the mistake of your life.
- No.

711
01:21:57,861 --> 01:21:59,988
I made that many years ago.

712
01:22:03,066 --> 01:22:05,432
I trust you can see yourself out.

713
01:22:25,823 --> 01:22:28,656
- Damn you, man, open the door!
- Your Grace.

714
01:24:27,044 --> 01:24:30,036
Mama, Mama, Mama, Mama!

715
01:24:34,618 --> 01:24:36,381
Mama, Mama, Mama.

716
01:24:54,905 --> 01:24:58,238
- Come on, girls.
- Mama. I love you.

717
01:24:58,342 --> 01:25:02,142
Girls, run along.
Your mother will join you in a minute.

718
01:25:02,245 --> 01:25:03,473
Come on.

719
01:25:06,617 --> 01:25:07,948
Run along.

720
01:25:12,389 --> 01:25:13,413
G.

721
01:25:27,704 --> 01:25:29,467
You must know
how greatly pleased I am

722
01:25:29,573 --> 01:25:32,599
that we have come to an arrangement.

723
01:25:32,709 --> 01:25:36,805
It's not good for little ones
to be without their mother for so long.

724
01:25:36,913 --> 01:25:40,576
- My life for theirs.
- That's one way of putting it.

725
01:25:43,253 --> 01:25:47,280
Your mother called it "common decency
before personal gratification,"

726
01:25:47,391 --> 01:25:50,224
or some such thing.
The exact words escape me.

727
01:25:50,327 --> 01:25:54,024
How about
"imprisoned in my own house"?

728
01:25:56,733 --> 01:25:59,395
No. That's not how she put it.

729
01:26:01,338 --> 01:26:03,533
I would have remembered that.

730
01:26:28,098 --> 01:26:29,725
Georgiana!

731
01:26:29,833 --> 01:26:32,666
Unhand me!

732
01:26:32,769 --> 01:26:34,066
Georgiana!

733
01:26:37,841 --> 01:26:41,709
Georgiana! Will you please unhand me?

734
01:26:41,812 --> 01:26:43,143
Excuse me.

735
01:26:50,320 --> 01:26:52,880
Georgiana! Please.

736
01:26:54,591 --> 01:26:55,922
Georgiana!

737
01:26:57,494 --> 01:26:59,962
- Thank you, Burleigh.
- Let him go.

738
01:27:01,798 --> 01:27:07,498
I have written a dozen times a day.
Still, there is nothing from you.

739
01:27:07,604 --> 01:27:11,131
What has happened?
Do you love me no longer?

740
01:27:12,609 --> 01:27:17,046
- My personal feelings remain unaltered.
- Then we must be together again.

741
01:27:17,147 --> 01:27:19,741
I want to marry you.
I want you to bear my children.

742
01:27:19,850 --> 01:27:21,545
And I don't care if they're boys or girls!

743
01:27:21,651 --> 01:27:25,052
- I wish it could be that way.
- It can. It will.

744
01:27:26,289 --> 01:27:28,314
Sorrows will come
however we try to avoid them.

745
01:27:28,425 --> 01:27:30,655
We must stay the course
and never give in.

746
01:27:30,761 --> 01:27:33,525
- No, Charles.
- You must leave and be with me.

747
01:27:33,630 --> 01:27:35,791
A free woman. Now! Let us leave now!

748
01:27:35,899 --> 01:27:38,629
I cannot abandon my children.

749
01:27:41,905 --> 01:27:44,601
Listen to what you are asking me to do.

750
01:28:37,761 --> 01:28:41,253
What's the matter?
Don't like the pigeon?

751
01:28:43,633 --> 01:28:45,498
I find it quite decent.

752
01:28:53,176 --> 01:28:55,838
I'm carrying Charles Grey's child.

753
01:29:09,159 --> 01:29:12,754
Please be so kind as to inform
the Duchess of my decision.

754
01:29:14,798 --> 01:29:17,028
This is how it will be.

755
01:29:17,133 --> 01:29:21,069
You will be taken to the country
where you will give birth to the child,

756
01:29:21,171 --> 01:29:25,267
and the child will be trusted
to the care of Charles Grey's family.

757
01:29:29,412 --> 01:29:31,073
Are you listening?

758
01:29:32,082 --> 01:29:34,073
I think she's heard you. Let's leave her.

759
01:29:34,184 --> 01:29:36,175
- Georgiana, please.
- I said let's leave.

760
01:29:36,319 --> 01:29:38,719
This is not a discussion.
She's been informed of my decision.

761
01:29:38,822 --> 01:29:40,790
- Have pity on her, William.
- Pity be damned.

762
01:29:40,891 --> 01:29:43,223
She's brought this upon herself,
as well you know.

763
01:29:43,326 --> 01:29:46,318
- Now come.
- No. I will go with her.

764
01:29:47,430 --> 01:29:48,988
But you're not going anywhere.

765
01:29:49,099 --> 01:29:50,794
I will go with G, if G will have me,

766
01:29:50,901 --> 01:29:54,701
and there's nothing you can do or say
to stop either of us.

767
01:30:48,158 --> 01:30:51,753
- Thank you for coming.
- I couldn't not be with you.

768
01:31:29,332 --> 01:31:30,697
It's time.

769
01:31:35,005 --> 01:31:37,633
- Would it help...
- No, I must take her.

770
01:33:01,057 --> 01:33:04,356
Your Grace, I'm General Grey.

771
01:33:07,230 --> 01:33:08,788
Where's Charles?

772
01:33:09,699 --> 01:33:12,964
Your husband thought it best
if I took care of this.

773
01:33:50,740 --> 01:33:52,230
General Grey.

774
01:33:54,944 --> 01:33:56,605
Her name is Eliza.

775
01:34:08,625 --> 01:34:09,922
Come on.

776
01:34:21,371 --> 01:34:26,308
Come on, G. I've got you. I've got you.

777
01:35:51,995 --> 01:35:55,556
I'm not particularly adept
at expressing myself

778
01:35:55,665 --> 01:35:59,431
when it comes to matters
of a more personal nature.

779
01:36:02,272 --> 01:36:03,864
But I shall try.

780
01:36:06,876 --> 01:36:09,743
Over the years, I have acted in ways

781
01:36:09,846 --> 01:36:14,112
that you have judged to be harsh.

782
01:36:18,187 --> 01:36:21,623
Well, I do not wish for you
to undergo any further suffering.

783
01:36:23,626 --> 01:36:29,758
In fact, I would like our lives
to find a calm normality.

784
01:36:39,575 --> 01:36:41,736
Lady Melbourne has arranged
a small gathering

785
01:36:41,844 --> 01:36:45,177
in honor of your recent return
from holiday.

786
01:36:45,315 --> 01:36:48,876
And given some of the vague reports
that have been circulating this past year

787
01:36:49,018 --> 01:36:51,646
I think it would be wise for us to go.

788
01:36:53,556 --> 01:36:55,786
A show of unity, so to speak.

789
01:36:59,629 --> 01:37:01,256
Who will be there?

790
01:37:03,566 --> 01:37:04,897
Everybody.

791
01:37:16,045 --> 01:37:17,410
As you wish.

792
01:38:02,992 --> 01:38:05,222
How wonderful to be that free.

793
01:38:21,911 --> 01:38:23,276
Come here.

794
01:38:30,686 --> 01:38:34,952
Come here. Little G, come here.

795
01:38:49,405 --> 01:38:53,398
The Duke and Duchess of Devonshire
and Lady Elizabeth Foster.

796
01:39:06,589 --> 01:39:07,920
- Your Grace.
- It's lovely to see you.

797
01:39:08,024 --> 01:39:10,015
Welcome back, Your Grace.

798
01:39:13,429 --> 01:39:14,760
Excuse me.

799
01:39:15,598 --> 01:39:18,863
- Welcome back.
- Welcome home, Your Grace.

800
01:39:18,968 --> 01:39:21,869
- Welcome back.
- Welcome back, G.

801
01:39:21,971 --> 01:39:24,531
Your presence has been sorely missed.

802
01:40:04,514 --> 01:40:06,243
Would you excuse me?

803
01:40:09,785 --> 01:40:12,253
- Mr. Grey.
- Your Grace.

804
01:40:15,658 --> 01:40:17,956
I trust your tour was enjoyable.

805
01:40:19,529 --> 01:40:21,053
Yes.

806
01:40:21,163 --> 01:40:25,031
We spent the summer in Switzerland
and the winter in Nice.

807
01:40:25,134 --> 01:40:27,227
Well, I speak on behalf of everybody

808
01:40:27,336 --> 01:40:31,238
when I say how glad I am
that you have arrived home safely.

809
01:40:35,611 --> 01:40:37,806
And what news with you?

810
01:40:40,116 --> 01:40:41,777
I'm to be engaged.

811
01:40:44,720 --> 01:40:46,381
To Lady Ponsonby.

812
01:40:48,291 --> 01:40:50,851
The announcement will follow shortly.

813
01:40:52,495 --> 01:40:54,190
Congratulations.

814
01:40:57,567 --> 01:41:01,298
And I have a niece, Eliza,

815
01:41:04,674 --> 01:41:06,574
who is very much loved.

816
01:41:14,984 --> 01:41:17,475
One day you should come
and meet her,

817
01:41:18,721 --> 01:41:20,382
in a little while.

818
01:41:22,525 --> 01:41:24,186
If you would like.

819
01:41:27,163 --> 01:41:29,290
I would like that very much.

820
01:42:53,649 --> 01:42:55,583
Who's going to catch me first?

821
01:42:59,088 --> 01:43:00,612
- Me!
- Quick, girls.

822
01:43:00,723 --> 01:43:03,692
Quick, I'm going to get away!

823
01:43:03,793 --> 01:43:08,856
Come on, girls, keep running.

824
01:43:18,774 --> 01:43:21,572
And I love you, and I love you.
