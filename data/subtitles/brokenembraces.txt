00:01:19,942 --> 00:01:23,192
BROKEN EMBRACES

3
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:02,485
What's your name?

4
00:02:03,444 --> 00:02:04,737
Harry Caine.

5
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,158
I used to be called Mateo.
and I was a film director.

6
00:02:10,035 --> 00:02:12,996
I was always tempted by the idea
of being someone else,

7
00:02:13,288 --> 00:02:14,289
as well as myself.

8
00:02:15,456 --> 00:02:18,126
Living one life
wasn't enough for me.

9
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:20,045
So I invented a pseudonym:

10
00:02:20,461 --> 00:02:21,755
Harry Caine,

11
00:02:22,631 --> 00:02:26,802
an adventurer who, as fate
would have it, became a writer.

12
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:31,515
I made him sign all
the stories and scripts I wrote.

13
00:02:32,308 --> 00:02:35,727
For years,
Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine

14
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:37,979
shared the same body.

15
00:02:38,397 --> 00:02:39,398
Mine.

16
00:02:40,399 --> 00:02:42,234
But there came a time when,

17
00:02:42,276 --> 00:02:45,988
suddenly, I could only
be Harry Caine.

18
00:02:46,738 --> 00:02:48,699
I became my alter-ego.

19
00:02:49,366 --> 00:02:51,786
a self made writer
created by himself.

20
00:02:53,955 --> 00:02:56,415
There was just one unexpected detail.

21
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,419
Harry Caine
would be a blind writer.

22
00:03:02,672 --> 00:03:04,173
Ernesto Martel is dead!

23
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,217
Who?

24
00:03:06,801 --> 00:03:09,804
Ernesto Martel.
I know his granddaughter.

25
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:11,931
So he's dead...

26
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:13,891
Yes. Did you know him?

27
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:20,023
What interests you?

28
00:03:20,565 --> 00:03:21,984
Politics,

29
00:03:22,692 --> 00:03:24,236
the economy, culture...?

30
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:26,154
I'm interested in you.

31
00:03:26,864 --> 00:03:28,156
What are you like?

32
00:03:28,949 --> 00:03:30,909
Can you describe yourself?

33
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,457
What do you want to know?

34
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,835
Your measurements, for example.

35
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:44,047
36- 26- 36.

36
00:03:45,383 --> 00:03:46,550
What color are your eyes?

37
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,387
Green,

38
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:52,098
With blue highlights in the summer.

39
00:03:53,182 --> 00:03:54,100
Your hair?

40
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:56,560
How are you dressed?

41
00:03:58,146 --> 00:04:00,106
I'm blonde,

42
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:03,777
with long, straight hair.

43
00:04:04,694 --> 00:04:08,615
I'm wearing a purple tank top,

44
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:10,700
tight jeans...

45
00:04:11,868 --> 00:04:13,202
Tight?

46
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:16,540
Yes, tight.

47
00:04:16,873 --> 00:04:17,832
And heels.

48
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,043
High heels?

49
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:21,295
Very high.

50
00:04:24,756 --> 00:04:26,008
Let's see...

51
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,554
Blonde hair,

52
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:32,932
long.

53
00:04:34,224 --> 00:04:35,893
Let's see your eyes...

54
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,854
Green eyes

55
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:41,106
with blue highlights in the summer.

56
00:04:41,649 --> 00:04:43,025
and your skin...

57
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,111
Such beautiful skin.

58
00:04:47,572 --> 00:04:49,031
Lips...

59
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:54,287
juicy.

60
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:48,926
May I use the washroom?

61
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:51,512
At the end of the hallway.

62
00:06:08,154 --> 00:06:10,490
Sorry, I thought you were alone.

63
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:13,076
Can I come in or
are you having another round?

64
00:06:13,118 --> 00:06:15,370
No, no, come in please.
We've finished.

65
00:06:18,707 --> 00:06:22,461
She helped me cross the street,
so I invited her in to read me the paper.

66
00:06:25,046 --> 00:06:26,673
This place is in shambles.

67
00:06:30,011 --> 00:06:32,138
- What are you looking for?
- My shirt.

68
00:06:33,472 --> 00:06:34,431
Here.

69
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:35,933
Your shirt.

70
00:06:37,018 --> 00:06:38,352
Something else?

71
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,771
your socks?

72
00:06:39,788 --> 00:06:41,665
Yes, thanks.

73
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:43,959
There you go.

74
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:45,335
Thanks.

75
00:06:53,302 --> 00:06:55,637
Hello...

76
00:06:55,887 --> 00:06:58,139
Hi.

77
00:07:01,876 --> 00:07:03,420
Well Harry, I'll be off.

78
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:06,924
- Thanks for your help.
- You're welcome.

79
00:07:07,257 --> 00:07:09,676
- You're standing on my foot.
- I'm sorry!

80
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:13,138
It was a pleasure.

81
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,556
Likewise.

82
00:07:15,182 --> 00:07:16,850
- Thank you.
- It's nothing.

83
00:07:19,102 --> 00:07:20,479
Well, I have to go.

84
00:07:20,521 --> 00:07:22,690
I hope we meet again.

85
00:07:32,074 --> 00:07:36,037
You can't just bring home the first person
who helps you cross the street!

86
00:07:36,079 --> 00:07:37,913
Something might happen to you.

87
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:40,875
Everything has already
happened to me

88
00:07:40,917 --> 00:07:43,795
All I can do now is enjoy life.

89
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:50,176
Diego told me that you finished
the script yesterday.

90
00:07:51,177 --> 00:07:53,722
Almost, I want to add a final epilogue.

91
00:07:53,763 --> 00:07:57,434
I was supposed to deliver it to the
producer and director today.

92
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:00,186
You'll have it tomorrow,
don't worry.

93
00:08:01,813 --> 00:08:03,273
Ernesto Martel is dead.

94
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:09,863
He was very ill.

95
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:14,076
It's been a long time
since we last spoke of him.

96
00:08:16,578 --> 00:08:17,662
Yes, that's true.

97
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:21,475
Hello.

98
00:08:23,043 --> 00:08:24,253
You look awful.

99
00:08:24,294 --> 00:08:25,838
Because I was running.

100
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,548
It's Monday

101
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:31,176
You don't have to run for my sake, Diego
We're in no rush.

102
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,179
I am.
I promised the script.

103
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:36,766
Don't worry you'll have it tonight

104
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:39,102
Diego, we're changing the ending.

105
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,353
Right away?

106
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:45,191
I've been thinking about the next script.

107
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,361
Some fantasy or horror for teens.

108
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,154
That's what sells best.

109
00:08:50,654 --> 00:08:52,615
I don't know if I can.

110
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,660
I'd thought about,

111
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:58,913
developing a story based
on Arthur Miller's son.

112
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:02,917
- The writer who married Marilyn?
- Yes.

113
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,671
It was in Vanity Fair.
I read it in the paper.

114
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:10,550
After Marilyn,
he married the photographer Inge Morath

115
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,261
and they had a child.

116
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,805
He was born with Down's syndrome
and Miller hid him away.

117
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,643
He didn't even mention him
in his memoirs.

118
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,603
and he never wanted to see him.

119
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,940
Despite his wife's pleas,
he would never see the child.

120
00:09:27,317 --> 00:09:28,611
That's horrible!

121
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:31,947
One day,
they met by chance.

122
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:36,536
Miller gave a lecture in defense
of a mental retard,

123
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:40,665
who'd been sentenced to death
after making a forced confession.

124
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:44,460
His son with Down's syndrome
was in the audience.

125
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:45,836
After the speech,

126
00:09:45,878 --> 00:09:49,340
the son went up to the podium
and embraced his father.

127
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,011
Miller didn't know how to
get free of that man,

128
00:09:53,762 --> 00:09:56,932
until the stranger let go
and said:

129
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:59,392
"I am your son Daniel

130
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:01,937
"and I'm very proud of you, dad."

131
00:10:05,566 --> 00:10:08,109
I don't think we can write
about Arthur Miller

132
00:10:08,151 --> 00:10:10,737
Without asking the family
for permission.

133
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:12,198
We can change the names.

134
00:10:12,239 --> 00:10:14,366
It isn't about the
pettiness of the father.

135
00:10:14,408 --> 00:10:17,786
but the strength of the son,
who survives without any grudge

136
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:19,913
towards the parent who ignored
him his whole life.

137
00:10:21,165 --> 00:10:23,125
The subject is interesting.

138
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:26,253
But years ago

139
00:10:26,295 --> 00:10:29,090
when you got back to
writing scripts

140
00:10:29,131 --> 00:10:33,427
You told me you would never write
remakes, sequels, or biopics.

141
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:36,639
I remember perfectly, because
I was surprised about biopics.

142
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:37,849
It isn't a biopic,

143
00:10:37,890 --> 00:10:41,143
it's about surpassing oneself
and inate goodness.

144
00:10:41,769 --> 00:10:42,979
Yes, I'll get it.

145
00:10:46,733 --> 00:10:47,984
I brought yogurt

146
00:10:48,025 --> 00:10:51,529
but he's out of cleaning
products and juice too

147
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:54,282
and pick up his dry cleaning.

148
00:10:55,909 --> 00:10:57,744
Hey guys, I'm going.

149
00:10:58,912 --> 00:11:02,290
- Talk to you later, Henry
- OK, Judit, OK.

150
00:11:23,521 --> 00:11:25,064
- How's it going?
- Good. You?

151
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:27,483
Good. Do you have the set?

152
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:30,486
Freshly downloaded from eMule!

153
00:11:30,945 --> 00:11:31,946
Cool!

154
00:11:35,324 --> 00:11:37,493
Do you want a hit of Crystal?

155
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:41,080
Not tonight. I need to sleep
once in awhile.

156
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,541
Cover me.

157
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,209
Try to be discreet.

158
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:47,587
There's no one around!

159
00:11:54,594 --> 00:11:56,346
Buy me a drink?

160
00:11:56,555 --> 00:11:58,057
Order what you want.

161
00:11:58,807 --> 00:12:01,300
- You want something?
- No.

162
00:12:05,272 --> 00:12:08,025
Browse with the
up arrow or down arrow.

163
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:09,193

168
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:23,707
Death of businessman
Ernesto Martel.

169
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:25,918
Obituary: Ernesto Martel,

170
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:28,754
the Chilean-born financier
died yesterday

171
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:30,589
at his residence in Madrid.

172
00:12:30,631 --> 00:12:34,802
Living in Spain since childhood, Martel was
one of the leading businessmen of the 90s

173
00:12:35,303 --> 00:12:38,139
Ermar Capital, his empire
created in the 80's,

174
00:12:38,181 --> 00:12:42,435
financed major infrastructure
projects in latin america.

175
00:12:42,476 --> 00:12:44,521
Maried twice,
with two children,

176
00:12:44,563 --> 00:12:46,773
his reputation was tainted
in recent years

177
00:12:46,815 --> 00:12:49,859
by his involvment in the
Apresto scandal

178
00:12:49,901 --> 00:12:52,946
Accused of fraud and tax evasion
in 2002

179
00:12:52,987 --> 00:12:55,657
He was sentenced to
three years in prison.

180
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,203
I just spoke with
the Transport Minister

181
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,331
The project is under way.

182
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:05,459
We will build the subway in Caracas.

183
00:13:06,335 --> 00:13:09,004
For sure, there is a lot of money.

184
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:12,758
For at least five years.

185
00:13:15,803 --> 00:13:19,807
I'm looking for a qualified company
and thought of you.

186
00:13:20,683 --> 00:13:23,769
Of course.
Everything will go through me.

187
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:26,481
The president told me himself.

188
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,203
I'll call you later, OK?

189
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:43,664
Yes Mr. Martel?

190
00:13:44,165 --> 00:13:45,250
Lena...

191
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:46,960
Can you come into my office?

192
00:13:47,711 --> 00:13:49,630
I want to dictate.

193
00:13:50,506 --> 00:13:52,090
Yes sir, right away.

194
00:14:10,109 --> 00:14:12,820
It's for the Industry Minister.

195
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:15,697
"Dear Antonio, I am pleased..."

196
00:14:17,033 --> 00:14:17,867
Sorry, I'm sorry.

197
00:14:17,909 --> 00:14:19,451
Are you feeling alright?

198
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,748
"I am pleased to announce that soon,

199
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,959
"I'll be meeting with a
Venezuelan delegation..."

200
00:14:27,752 --> 00:14:28,586
Sorry.

201
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,257
Tell me what's wrong.

202
00:14:32,715 --> 00:14:33,883
I'm sure I can help.

203
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:37,179
My father is very i'll

204
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:40,098
He's being discharged this afternoon
and I want to be there.

205
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:42,642
Of course.
What's wrong with him?

206
00:14:44,644 --> 00:14:46,939
Stomach cancer,
and it's metastasized

207
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:50,525
Oh, I'm sorry.

208
00:15:07,084 --> 00:15:08,377
Where's Papa?

209
00:15:09,087 --> 00:15:10,671
He's waiting inside.

210
00:15:10,713 --> 00:15:13,466
I can't believe they left you here,

211
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:16,052
on the street, like dogs.

212
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:18,679
Wasn't the doctor
operating this week?

213
00:15:18,721 --> 00:15:20,974
He was supposed to.

214
00:15:21,015 --> 00:15:24,310
This morning he told us
they were discharging him.

215
00:15:24,352 --> 00:15:26,312
I asked what that meant.

216
00:15:26,354 --> 00:15:28,982
He said: "It's simple,
it's July, I'm going on vacation."

217
00:15:29,357 --> 00:15:30,775
What?

218
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:32,318
I asked: "Are you putting us
on the street?"

219
00:15:32,611 --> 00:15:35,071
"No, ma'am.

220
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:38,492
"I'm sending him home."

221
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:40,535
"But what can I do with him
at home?"

222
00:15:40,994 --> 00:15:44,581
"That's your problem.
I'm going on vacation."

223
00:15:44,622 --> 00:15:46,083
"He's dying."

224
00:15:46,624 --> 00:15:49,586
"So, he can die
peacefully at home."

225
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,091
They can't torture him for 20 days
with tests and then do this.

226
00:15:54,674 --> 00:15:55,884
Ladies!

227
00:15:56,301 --> 00:15:58,511
Have you forgotten about me?

228
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:00,639
What are you saying, dad!

229
00:16:00,681 --> 00:16:02,265
No one could forget you.

230
00:16:02,307 --> 00:16:03,684
Sweetheart.

231
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:05,894
Take it easy.

232
00:16:05,936 --> 00:16:08,230
Isn't it nice to get out?

233
00:16:20,284 --> 00:16:22,078
I'll put the bags in.

234
00:16:50,024 --> 00:16:52,109
You'll be comfortable here.

235
00:16:53,027 --> 00:16:55,070
I'll bring your pills.

236
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:57,031
Try to rest.

237
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:05,247
I'm leaving now.
I've a lot to do.

238
00:17:06,373 --> 00:17:08,543
Call me if there's anything.

239
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:12,046
I'll come by in the morning.

240
00:17:13,381 --> 00:17:14,549
Bye, mom.

241
00:17:16,717 --> 00:17:18,136
Take care.

242
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:39,783
Madame Mylène? Hi it's Séverine.

243
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:43,579
Severine! It's been so long.
How nice to hear from you.

244
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,914
- I need some money.
- When?

245
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,710
Now. I'm free on the week-end.
During the week I'm busy.

246
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:53,004
I'll see what I can do.

247
00:17:54,215 --> 00:17:56,383
Can I call you tonight?

248
00:17:56,425 --> 00:17:58,760
Of course.
I'll be waiting.

249
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,295
Yes.

250
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:11,315
Séverine?

251
00:18:12,525 --> 00:18:13,275
Who's this?

252
00:18:13,651 --> 00:18:15,653
I'm calling on behalf of
Madame Mylène.

253
00:18:16,988 --> 00:18:19,407
You're mistaken.
There's no Séverine here.

254
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:22,577
I must have the wrong number.
Forgive me.

255
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,919
Your rails, ma'am.

256
00:18:33,255 --> 00:18:34,339
Hi, has he called you?

257
00:18:34,381 --> 00:18:35,340
Who?

258
00:18:35,382 --> 00:18:37,175
The client, who else?

259
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,136
How dare you give him my number!

260
00:18:39,177 --> 00:18:40,553
I couldn't refuse.

261
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,599
That's not how it works!
Are you crazy?

262
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:45,726
He knows all about you.

263
00:18:45,768 --> 00:18:48,771
I didn't tell him
he found out by himself.

264
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:51,899
He knows that you
tried your hand at acting,

265
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,442
and at times you've
"performed" for me.

266
00:18:54,943 --> 00:18:56,445
Months ago he made me promise

267
00:18:56,487 --> 00:18:58,906
that if you contacted me again
I'd call him.

268
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:00,783
I couldn't refuse,
he's my best client.

269
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:15,224
Yes

270
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:16,382
Oh, Magdalena!

271
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:18,468
Mom, how's dad?

272
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,428
Awful!

273
00:19:21,303 --> 00:19:23,306
We had a terrible night.

274
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:26,226
He's been vomiting blood
and everything.

275
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:30,188
it's like he'd burst inside.
I don't know what to do.

276
00:19:30,605 --> 00:19:31,523
I'm coming.

277
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:47,204
Yes.

278
00:19:47,205 --> 00:19:48,957
Mr. Martel? It's Lena.

279
00:19:51,544 --> 00:19:53,170
I'm sorry to bother you.

280
00:19:53,211 --> 00:19:54,463
You never bother me.

281
00:19:56,048 --> 00:19:58,509
I'm calling because
my father is dying.

282
00:19:58,717 --> 00:20:00,303
He has to be hospitalized,

283
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:02,180
but i don't know where.

284
00:20:02,513 --> 00:20:07,060
They sent him home yesterday
and we don't know what to do.

285
00:20:07,601 --> 00:20:08,937
Don't worry.

286
00:20:09,562 --> 00:20:12,816
We'll take him to a private clinic.

287
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:13,900
I'll take care of it.

288
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:18,404
Don't worry, Dr. Blasco is
the best digestive surgeon in Europe.

289
00:20:18,446 --> 00:20:19,989
Here.

290
00:20:23,493 --> 00:20:24,953
How's the patient?

291
00:20:24,994 --> 00:20:28,122
He arrived in very poor condition.
I think you know that.

292
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,624
Can you save him?

293
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,460
I am Ernesto Martel.

294
00:20:31,501 --> 00:20:33,170
We'll try our very best.

295
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:36,631
- But right now we can't operate.
- And tomorrow?

296
00:20:37,006 --> 00:20:39,927
Perhaps.
We're feeding him intravenously

297
00:20:39,969 --> 00:20:42,512
and he'll need a transfusion
to survive.

298
00:20:42,554 --> 00:20:44,890
Do the impossible to save him.

299
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:47,226
Of course.
That's my duty.

300
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:50,104
I'll keep you informed on the progress

301
00:20:50,145 --> 00:20:51,856
Can I stay?

302
00:20:51,897 --> 00:20:55,735
Of course, you can stay with him
as long as you wish.

303
00:20:59,655 --> 00:21:02,367
I can't thank you enough.

304
00:21:02,408 --> 00:21:04,994
I'm at your disposal ma'am.

305
00:21:05,328 --> 00:21:07,788
Do you want me to stay with you?

306
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:10,625
No, go on, love,
you've done enough.

307
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:13,336
Should I bring you some food?

308
00:21:14,462 --> 00:21:17,007
No, don't bother
I'll get something later.

309
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:18,674
I'll call you.

310
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:25,158
Thanks...

311
00:22:01,385 --> 00:22:02,136
Who's there?

312
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:03,596
It's Ray X.

313
00:22:03,638 --> 00:22:06,140
Ray X?
Nobody's called that.

314
00:22:06,433 --> 00:22:07,767
It's a nickname

315
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,811
I used to do lots of ecstasy.

316
00:22:10,478 --> 00:22:11,313
What do you want?

317
00:22:11,854 --> 00:22:14,732
I want to write a script with you
and direct it myself.

318
00:22:14,982 --> 00:22:16,068
You're a director?

319
00:22:16,651 --> 00:22:19,487
I made a very good documentary
14 years ago.

320
00:22:19,529 --> 00:22:21,614
This would be my first fiction.

321
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:25,202
Call my agent Judit Garcìa,
and talk to her

322
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:28,288
She can make an appointment for you

323
00:22:28,538 --> 00:22:30,040
I'm going for a shower.

324
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,167
You got me out of the bathroom.

325
00:22:38,299 --> 00:22:40,384
You gonna stay there all day?

326
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:42,595
You didn't give me
Judit Garcìa's number

327
00:22:42,636 --> 00:22:45,931
Look it up.
She's a well-known production manager.

328
00:22:45,972 --> 00:22:47,266
I'm going.

329
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:49,476
Yes, go on.

330
00:23:07,255 --> 00:23:08,098
Yes?

331
00:23:08,223 --> 00:23:09,641
Hi, Harry. It is I.

332
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:10,934
Hi, Judit.

333
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,168
A young director rang me.
Ray X.

334
00:23:14,211 --> 00:23:17,088
He wants to write a script with you.

335
00:23:17,422 --> 00:23:19,716
- You know about it? Yes
- He wants to see you this afternoon.

336
00:23:19,757 --> 00:23:21,218
Or tomorrow.

337
00:23:21,676 --> 00:23:24,471
I asked for an advance,
and he agreed.

338
00:23:24,721 --> 00:23:27,224
but I can't go with you,
I'm busy with the Americans.

339
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:31,269
OK, I'll see him
and tell you about it.

340
00:23:31,311 --> 00:23:34,272
I hope you like him,
he seems to be well-heeled.

341
00:23:34,565 --> 00:23:35,774
Have you seen him?

342
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:39,737
No from his voice,
and from the check he's going to sign.

343
00:23:39,778 --> 00:23:42,197
I'll send Diego so you're not alone.

344
00:23:42,239 --> 00:23:43,741
Ciao

345
00:23:49,122 --> 00:23:51,332
Alicante or Barcelone?

346
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:52,144
Barcelona.

347
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:57,024
The director really wants Barcelona.
I think Alicante it's a better option.

348
00:24:09,537 --> 00:24:10,913
Hello.

349
00:24:10,977 --> 00:24:14,313
- I'm here to see Harry.
- Yes, he's in his office.

350
00:24:30,289 --> 00:24:31,706
Hi, I'm Ray X.

351
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:33,542
How are you?

352
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,211
Have a seat.

353
00:24:48,516 --> 00:24:49,434
I'm listening

354
00:24:50,351 --> 00:24:52,228
I really like your work.

355
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,063
I've seen all of it.

356
00:24:55,148 --> 00:24:56,566
Thank you very much.

357
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:59,152
Let's get to the point.

358
00:24:59,694 --> 00:25:02,322
What kind of story
do you want to write?

359
00:25:07,368 --> 00:25:10,163
I'd like to write a story about

360
00:25:10,664 --> 00:25:14,209
a son's revenge on his
father's memory.

361
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:16,336
Why does the son want revenge?

362
00:25:18,797 --> 00:25:20,799
The father destroyed him
and ruined his life.

363
00:25:21,592 --> 00:25:22,509
How?

364
00:25:24,177 --> 00:25:26,847
The father is a violent man,
a homophobe.

365
00:25:26,888 --> 00:25:29,683
unscrupulous and very powerful.

366
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:33,229
But the son is a sensitive boy,

367
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,897
but he's got lots of complexes
and he's weak.

368
00:25:36,065 --> 00:25:38,400
He always tries to please his father.

369
00:25:38,609 --> 00:25:41,946
He's a homosexual but
he got married twice, like his father.

370
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:44,240
And he separated,
like he did.

371
00:25:44,866 --> 00:25:48,953
He's got a son, who hates him
as much as he hated his father.

372
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:51,122
When the father dies.

373
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:53,916
the son can finally rebuild his life.

374
00:25:54,334 --> 00:25:57,169
That's his salvation, his revenge.

375
00:25:57,212 --> 00:25:58,963
and the story I want to tell.

376
00:25:59,589 --> 00:26:02,217
I fear I'm not the writer
you're looking for.

377
00:26:02,675 --> 00:26:03,843
You are!

378
00:26:04,344 --> 00:26:06,513
More than you know.

379
00:26:07,264 --> 00:26:08,473
I'll pay whatever you ask.

380
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:10,308
It's too personal.

381
00:26:11,351 --> 00:26:12,853
Make it your own.

382
00:26:13,353 --> 00:26:16,106
Thank's, but no.
Now, if you don't mind... Diego!

383
00:26:21,612 --> 00:26:23,029
I'll leave you my number.

384
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:30,161
If you change your mind.

385
00:26:30,454 --> 00:26:32,539
- Come along!
- Leave me alone!

386
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,710
I'm sure we'll see each other again.

387
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:38,545
In my case,
that would be a miracle.

388
00:26:38,587 --> 00:26:40,714
- Please, come with me
- I'm coming!

389
00:26:42,277 --> 00:26:44,321
Good bye.

390
00:26:53,603 --> 00:26:54,896
Son of a bitch!

391
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:01,611
- He was talking about himself, right?
- I guess.

392
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:03,738
Look in the top drawer.

393
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:07,117
Look through the photos
of the '94 shoot.

394
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,618
He may be in one of them.

395
00:27:31,809 --> 00:27:32,935
Keep looking.

396
00:27:50,829 --> 00:27:51,705
Here he is.

397
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,497
Describe the photo.

398
00:27:54,207 --> 00:27:56,209
He's with you on the shoot.

399
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,129
He's got long, straight hair
and he's holding a camera.

400
00:28:00,171 --> 00:28:01,506
I knew it.

401
00:28:01,548 --> 00:28:02,882
Who is he?

402
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,719
Ernesto Martel's son.

403
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,054
What can he want now?

404
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,559
Put the photos away and
close the drawer.

405
00:28:40,588 --> 00:28:42,215
Ernesto, it's me.

406
00:28:43,591 --> 00:28:46,094
We have to talk about our son.

407
00:28:46,511 --> 00:28:47,470
Not now, Rosanna

408
00:28:47,512 --> 00:28:49,764
I caught him trying on my dresses.

409
00:28:49,805 --> 00:28:53,309
It's your fault. You made him
effeminate to humiliate me.

410
00:28:53,351 --> 00:28:56,104
I'm sending him to you.
After all, you're his father.

411
00:28:56,146 --> 00:29:00,441
If I haven't been a good father
for 19 years, I doubt I'll learn now.

412
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:02,277
I have to go.

413
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:06,823
And tell him if he wants to talk to me
he can call me himself.

414
00:29:08,409 --> 00:29:11,620
- Don't be so hard on them.
- Theyr'e blackmailers!

415
00:29:11,662 --> 00:29:13,789
- Help me with my necklace
- Of course.

416
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:16,792
Why no invite your son here
for a few days?

417
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:19,003
That's what his mother just said.

418
00:29:20,046 --> 00:29:23,507
But it's best not
to involve you with them.

419
00:29:23,549 --> 00:29:24,967
He'd keep me company.

420
00:29:26,302 --> 00:29:29,555
- Does he like the cinema or theatre?
- Very much I think.

421
00:29:31,348 --> 00:29:33,517
His mother says
he's a bit of a fairy.

422
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:37,605
If I invite him
I'd like you to tell me if it's true.

423
00:29:37,855 --> 00:29:39,441
and if it can be fixed.

424
00:29:40,274 --> 00:29:42,777
- How will I know?
- You don't have to screw him.

425
00:29:42,819 --> 00:29:44,028
Oh thanks alot.

426
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:46,239
But you pretty girls
know those things.

427
00:29:46,281 --> 00:29:48,491
Call him, but I won't do that.

428
00:29:51,607 --> 00:29:52,792
(Off) This is shameful, Ernesto!

429
00:29:52,827 --> 00:29:55,081
What I don't like is
that you're living with a man.

430
00:29:55,123 --> 00:29:56,457
What'll your children think?

431
00:29:56,499 --> 00:29:58,459
That their father is homosexual.

432
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:01,713
He's got good taste
and that hes lucky.

433
00:30:02,673 --> 00:30:05,175
If they love me, they'll accept it.

434
00:30:05,216 --> 00:30:07,719
You should've told me
before we got married.

435
00:30:07,761 --> 00:30:11,807
If you'd stopped thinking about
my father's fortune you'd have realized.

436
00:30:11,848 --> 00:30:12,724
What do you mean?

437
00:30:12,766 --> 00:30:14,726
I'm hangin up. Pain in the ass!

438
00:30:14,768 --> 00:30:16,227
I've got another call.

439
00:30:19,148 --> 00:30:22,693
- I hope it's not your other ex-wife?
- I hope not.

440
00:30:23,402 --> 00:30:24,903
Never get married, Mario.

441
00:30:24,945 --> 00:30:27,239
I'm not planning to right now.

442
00:30:27,676 --> 00:30:28,718
Hello?

443
00:30:29,075 --> 00:30:30,117
It's Judit Garcìa.

444
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:32,411
Hi, did you get the money?

445
00:30:33,412 --> 00:30:34,789
I don't want it.

446
00:30:35,372 --> 00:30:37,625
I'm sending it back.
Ernesto.

447
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:41,003
Won't you call me Ray?
That's my artistic name.

448
00:30:41,546 --> 00:30:43,005
Artistic?

449
00:30:43,923 --> 00:30:45,007
What are you trying to do?

450
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:46,676
Erase my father's name.

451
00:30:47,427 --> 00:30:49,136
What's that got to do with Harry?

452
00:30:49,554 --> 00:30:51,681
I've wanted to see him for ages.

453
00:30:51,723 --> 00:30:55,227
And it's true I want to make a film
and have him write the script.

454
00:30:55,268 --> 00:30:57,229
I've got the male lead.

455
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:00,732
You're not a director.

456
00:31:01,066 --> 00:31:04,069
If you saw my documentary
you'd change your mind.

457
00:31:06,404 --> 00:31:07,740
Ernesto, forget about us.

458
00:31:07,781 --> 00:31:10,826
Don't be afraid of me.
I'm not my father.

459
00:31:11,326 --> 00:31:13,161
Stay away from Harry.

460
00:31:13,203 --> 00:31:16,289
Or else I'll report you for harassment!

461
00:31:19,251 --> 00:31:22,170
I really don't want to
scout for locations.

462
00:31:22,546 --> 00:31:26,259
But the Americans are paying
me a fortune and we need it.

463
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,720
Go on,
don't worry about me.

464
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,722
Give me Tonino Guerra's book.

465
00:31:32,598 --> 00:31:34,517
I'm worried about Harry too.

466
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,519
Look after him while I'm away

467
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,981
I'm busy,
I can't spend all day with him.

468
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:41,565
It's only 2 weeks.

469
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,152
Harry's fine on his own.

470
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:47,030
It's because of Ernesto Junior.

471
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:49,908
If he shows up again or calls

472
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,493
let me know right away.

473
00:31:51,535 --> 00:31:53,244
Why are you so worried?

474
00:31:53,287 --> 00:31:55,455
He's crazy.
I don't trust him.

475
00:31:55,497 --> 00:31:56,665
Why not?

476
00:31:57,291 --> 00:31:59,793
- It's a long story.
- Summarize.

477
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:02,629
This isn't the time.

478
00:32:04,506 --> 00:32:05,715
For you, it never is!

479
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:10,429
If you really mind looking after Harry,
i'm staying in Madrid.

480
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,806
Or hire someone else.

481
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:16,351
I don't mind keeping him company,
but I'm sick of all the secrets.

482
00:32:20,981 --> 00:32:22,442
When's your mother back?

483
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,570
I'm not sure,
in ten days, I think.

484
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:31,701
What are you looking at?

485
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,703
A poster that says
"Give blood".

486
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,496
- You want to give yours?
- No, no.

487
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:39,334
I just like the sound of it.

488
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,752
It would be a great film title.

489
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,671
It sounds good

490
00:32:43,714 --> 00:32:45,674
Like a vampire film.

491
00:32:45,716 --> 00:32:47,133
That's true.

492
00:32:47,342 --> 00:32:50,095
Imagine that behind the ad
there's a group of vampires

493
00:32:50,136 --> 00:32:54,433
who work in various donor clinics
they keep the donated blood

494
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:56,267
and use it themselves.

495
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:59,605
Your mother would like that story.
We'll write it.

496
00:33:00,625 --> 00:33:02,544
"Dona Sangre"("Give Blood")

497
00:33:02,691 --> 00:33:04,860
The vampires live like the Chinese,

498
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:08,530
as part of Spanish society
but without attracting attention.

499
00:33:08,572 --> 00:33:11,325
and like the Chinese they
also control several industries.

500
00:33:11,367 --> 00:33:13,452
Like sunglasses, for example.

501
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:17,372
And late night bars, discos,
after hours clubs.

502
00:33:17,414 --> 00:33:21,669
They don't need drugs to stay awake
so they're the best night workers.

503
00:33:21,711 --> 00:33:23,462
And the sun cream business.

504
00:33:23,504 --> 00:33:27,467
They're sensitive to climate change
and to holes in the ozone.

505
00:33:27,508 --> 00:33:30,428
Their sun creams
are the best on the market.

506
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,429
That's good.

507
00:33:31,721 --> 00:33:34,474
It must be a thick cream
like armor,

508
00:33:34,515 --> 00:33:36,101
to protect them all day

509
00:33:36,684 --> 00:33:38,728
That's how the story begins.

510
00:33:38,769 --> 00:33:41,606
A very beautiful girl,
totally naked.

511
00:33:41,647 --> 00:33:44,442
covering her body
with a really thick cream

512
00:33:44,484 --> 00:33:47,028
before going to work in a donor clinic.

513
00:33:47,362 --> 00:33:50,406
Her body has a beautiful,
velvety pallor.

514
00:33:51,241 --> 00:33:52,618
Great beginning.

515
00:33:53,076 --> 00:33:54,620
We need a love story.

516
00:33:55,453 --> 00:33:57,581
A mixed love story

517
00:33:57,623 --> 00:34:00,166
between the young vampire girl
and a normal boy.

518
00:34:00,208 --> 00:34:03,295
She works in one of those
blood donor clinics

519
00:34:03,337 --> 00:34:05,046
where they use the blood themselves.

520
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:06,840
He goes there to give blood.

521
00:34:06,882 --> 00:34:08,675
They instantly like each other.

522
00:34:09,301 --> 00:34:12,929
After she puts the needle in his vein,
she get really aroused.

523
00:34:12,972 --> 00:34:16,517
They start dating,
but she doesn't want him to become a vampire

524
00:34:16,558 --> 00:34:19,937
Those vampires don't proselytize.
They don't bite people.

525
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:22,148
unless it's really necessary.

526
00:34:22,398 --> 00:34:24,358
But they like sex right?

527
00:34:24,692 --> 00:34:25,735
Sure.

528
00:34:26,527 --> 00:34:30,072
That'll be one of the problems
because we need some tension.

529
00:34:31,741 --> 00:34:33,410
They relaly desire each other

530
00:34:33,451 --> 00:34:35,828
but when it comes to screwing,
she holds back.

531
00:34:36,329 --> 00:34:37,372
Why?

532
00:34:37,414 --> 00:34:40,917
In case she loses control and bites
his jugular in the heat of passion

533
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:44,462
She lets him do everything, in front
behind, whatever

534
00:34:44,504 --> 00:34:46,506
Except kiss her on the mouth.

535
00:34:46,881 --> 00:34:47,715
And her breasts?

536
00:34:49,176 --> 00:34:51,219
That's a high risk area.

537
00:34:51,428 --> 00:34:53,096
When he kisses her breasts,

538
00:34:53,138 --> 00:34:57,225
She hides her face with the pillow
and she rips it apart with her teeth.

539
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:58,977
And when she sucks on him?

540
00:34:59,645 --> 00:35:02,230
No blowjobs!
She'd tear it off right away

541
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:05,275
Well, a man can do without kisses,

542
00:35:05,317 --> 00:35:06,944
but it's tough when
they won't suck your dick!

543
00:35:06,985 --> 00:35:10,155
He's so in love
he accepts it.

544
00:35:10,406 --> 00:35:13,117
When they know each other better,
she'll wear a muzzle

545
00:35:13,159 --> 00:35:14,993
to protect both of them.

546
00:35:15,203 --> 00:35:18,957
When she gets aroused,
she has a kind of dental erection,

547
00:35:18,998 --> 00:35:21,918
and her mouth grows out
like shes a wolf.

548
00:35:24,295 --> 00:35:26,339
I really like your story.

549
00:35:26,547 --> 00:35:27,506
You will sign this one.

550
00:35:29,217 --> 00:35:32,554
I'll be your sparring partner,
like you've always been for me.

551
00:35:38,142 --> 00:35:40,937
The music you play
is fucking great!

552
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:44,524
And I really like you.
Did Alex tell you?

553
00:35:44,983 --> 00:35:47,361
I want us to be great friends

554
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:49,488
and you have to tell me everything.

555
00:35:49,529 --> 00:35:51,073
Let me work.

556
00:35:51,573 --> 00:35:53,617
You have to tell me everything.

557
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:57,037
I need a drink.

558
00:36:01,917 --> 00:36:04,378
Sorry, he's high on GHB.

559
00:36:04,419 --> 00:36:06,839
I don't like being touched up.

560
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:10,342
You want some MDMA?

561
00:36:11,093 --> 00:36:13,429
- Just a bit!
- OK.

562
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:15,848
I'm working tomorrow.

563
00:36:18,809 --> 00:36:21,854
We're working on a great vampire script.

564
00:36:21,889 --> 00:36:22,667
Are you?

565
00:36:41,082 --> 00:36:42,626
Want some GHB?

566
00:36:43,293 --> 00:36:45,337
I've had some MDMA.

567
00:36:56,765 --> 00:36:59,059
I think your friend likes me.

568
00:36:59,101 --> 00:37:00,644
Are you ok, Diego?

569
00:37:00,685 --> 00:37:02,437
What is it?

570
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,273
What happened?

571
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,984
- Is that your glass?
- Coke and GHB.

572
00:37:07,026 --> 00:37:09,737
Asshole!
Why did you put it next to his glass!

573
00:37:12,197 --> 00:37:14,158
Take it easy.

574
00:37:15,159 --> 00:37:17,453
Get some ice!
Call an ambulance!

575
00:37:42,738 --> 00:37:43,564
Hello?

576
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:44,638
Diego?

577
00:37:44,773 --> 00:37:47,317
No, I'm a friend of his.
Diego sick.

578
00:37:47,358 --> 00:37:49,653
We're taking him to Emergency

579
00:37:49,695 --> 00:37:53,324
What happened?
Can I speak to him?

580
00:37:55,659 --> 00:37:57,119
Where are you taking him?

581
00:37:57,161 --> 00:37:59,413
- Where are you going?
- Quiròn hospital.

582
00:38:02,458 --> 00:38:03,918
Come on, get in!

583
00:38:04,293 --> 00:38:06,295
He's coming.

584
00:38:06,503 --> 00:38:08,130
That's his jacket.

585
00:38:36,994 --> 00:38:38,745
Do you need help?

586
00:38:39,537 --> 00:38:40,372
I have to go.

587
00:38:40,413 --> 00:38:42,207
You want the hospital?

588
00:38:42,249 --> 00:38:43,709
- Yes, I do.
- I'll go with you.

589
00:38:44,167 --> 00:38:45,585
I'll hold on to you.

590
00:38:47,462 --> 00:38:48,714
- You want Reception?
- Yes.

591
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:19,328
How do you feel?

592
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:22,373
I don't know... shocked.

593
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:25,460
Did you speak to my mother?

594
00:39:27,504 --> 00:39:30,549
- Did you tell her about the coma?
- No! Are you crazy?

595
00:39:31,174 --> 00:39:33,427
Anyway, it was only six hours.

596
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:37,972
If you ever tell her,
say you fainted.

597
00:39:38,223 --> 00:39:39,808
Or whatever.

598
00:39:40,976 --> 00:39:44,688
I told her you ate something
that disagreed with you.

599
00:39:46,315 --> 00:39:47,692
Did she believe you?

600
00:39:48,442 --> 00:39:49,568
I don't know.

601
00:39:50,444 --> 00:39:54,657
She wanted to rush back
but I persuaded her not to.

602
00:39:58,494 --> 00:39:59,954
Are you sleeping?

603
00:40:00,955 --> 00:40:02,623
No I'm not sleepy.

604
00:40:04,124 --> 00:40:05,710
- You want to talk?
- No.

605
00:40:08,504 --> 00:40:10,048
You want me to talk?

606
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:13,384
I don't know.
If you want to.

607
00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:15,719
I mean to distract you.

608
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,848
Before I went into films.

609
00:40:19,348 --> 00:40:21,935
I was very good at telling stories

610
00:40:22,852 --> 00:40:27,566
Then will you tell me why my mother
is so afraid of Ernesto Junior?

611
00:40:28,316 --> 00:40:29,818
Is she?

612
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,196
She made me promise
I'd keep an eye out.

613
00:40:33,237 --> 00:40:35,031
In case he reappeared.

614
00:40:36,616 --> 00:40:38,577
She didn't say why?

615
00:40:39,536 --> 00:40:41,496
She never explains anything.

616
00:40:43,582 --> 00:40:45,792
It's a long story.

617
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,003
That's what she says

618
00:40:48,795 --> 00:40:50,672
How do you know him?

619
00:40:52,549 --> 00:40:55,177
It was 14 years ago,

620
00:40:56,345 --> 00:41:00,516
In an office we'd rented
to prepare my latest film.

621
00:41:03,102 --> 00:41:05,938
After writing and directing
five dramas,

622
00:41:06,146 --> 00:41:08,899
I'd finally written a comedy,

623
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:10,610
or so I thought.

624
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:14,197
I wanted to change genres
and take a risk.

625
00:41:14,947 --> 00:41:16,616
And I certainly did.

626
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,576
Take a risk, I mean.

627
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:24,124
Mateo!

628
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:28,795
There's a girl here.
She doesnt have an appointment.

629
00:41:28,837 --> 00:41:30,046
What's she like?

630
00:41:31,757 --> 00:41:34,092
Too pretty to be funny.

631
00:41:35,386 --> 00:41:38,305
She's the financier Ernesto Martel's
mistress.

632
00:41:38,347 --> 00:41:39,765
She's here with his son.

633
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:41,099
Is she an actress?

634
00:41:41,642 --> 00:41:44,478
If she's been with that man
for two years she must be.

635
00:41:45,061 --> 00:41:48,065
But come out and say hello,
just to be polite.

636
00:41:48,107 --> 00:41:51,027
You have to be nice to important men.
You never know.

637
00:41:51,068 --> 00:41:52,153
OK.

638
00:41:56,908 --> 00:41:58,200
GIRLS AND SUITCASES

639
00:42:16,136 --> 00:42:17,053
Lena.

640
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:18,471
Mateo.

641
00:42:18,513 --> 00:42:20,973
I'm Ernesto Martel... Junior.

642
00:42:21,975 --> 00:42:24,061
I apologize for turning up like this.

643
00:42:24,102 --> 00:42:26,897
I heard you were holding auditions for
your next film.

644
00:42:27,773 --> 00:42:30,275
- Yes
- I'd love to audition.

645
00:42:30,776 --> 00:42:32,194
I can come another day.

646
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:36,532
Now that you're here,
we'll read something.

647
00:42:40,118 --> 00:42:41,912
Stay here.

648
00:42:50,546 --> 00:42:52,631
The reading didn't work out.

649
00:42:53,174 --> 00:42:55,801
We were both too nervous.

650
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,973
The first meeting
only served to show me

651
00:43:00,431 --> 00:43:04,060
that the mere presence
of that woman disturbed me.

652
00:43:14,654 --> 00:43:16,573
Where were you this morning?

653
00:43:17,282 --> 00:43:18,700
Didn't Ernesto tell you?

654
00:43:18,742 --> 00:43:20,452
I didn't ask him.

655
00:43:22,287 --> 00:43:24,623
We went to see a film director.

656
00:43:24,664 --> 00:43:25,790
to do an audition.

657
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,876
An audition? Why?

658
00:43:28,752 --> 00:43:30,170
I want to work.

659
00:43:31,005 --> 00:43:32,965
Weren't you going
to redecorate the house?

660
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:35,384
You have to change the furniture,
carpets, lamps...

661
00:43:35,425 --> 00:43:36,677
I don't know how to do that.

662
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:39,221
Hire a decorator.

663
00:43:39,263 --> 00:43:42,558
Even if I do,
you'll have to guide him.

664
00:43:43,017 --> 00:43:44,852
I want to be an actress.

665
00:43:44,893 --> 00:43:46,645
I always have.

666
00:43:48,814 --> 00:43:50,316
You tried before...

667
00:43:51,024 --> 00:43:52,860
and look how you ended up.

668
00:43:54,362 --> 00:43:55,821
That was a low blow.

669
00:43:57,698 --> 00:43:59,783
I'm sorry, my love,
forgive me.

670
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:04,122
I'm going upstairs.

671
00:44:05,915 --> 00:44:07,291
Lena, please.

672
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:11,004
Don't get angry, darling,
I beg you.

673
00:44:11,045 --> 00:44:13,840
In any case, don't worry.
I was no good.

674
00:44:13,882 --> 00:44:15,634
I was too nervous.

675
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:19,429
Telephone
Its Mr. Mateo Blanco.

676
00:44:20,597 --> 00:44:21,806
Enter!

677
00:44:23,308 --> 00:44:25,352
He says it's important.

678
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:36,927
Yes? Yes, yes, of course...
Very good, very good, thanks.

679
00:44:40,951 --> 00:44:42,912
It was the director.

680
00:44:43,328 --> 00:44:46,541
The audition wasn't enough,
he wants to see me again.

681
00:44:47,041 --> 00:44:48,208
What are you going to do?

682
00:44:49,209 --> 00:44:50,461
Go and see him, no?

683
00:44:52,087 --> 00:44:55,341
I need to do something.
I've always wanted to be an actress.

684
00:44:55,383 --> 00:44:57,218
And what about me?

685
00:44:59,011 --> 00:45:00,054
Hi this is Magdalena Rivero.

686
00:45:00,096 --> 00:45:03,058
I want to cancel my massage tomorrow.

687
00:45:03,099 --> 00:45:05,977
I'll call you another time.
Thank you.

688
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:08,688
They still haven't given me the part.

689
00:45:08,729 --> 00:45:10,065
They will.

690
00:45:10,315 --> 00:45:12,525
If they do, it wont change a thing.

691
00:45:12,567 --> 00:45:15,236
except that I'll be working too,
like you.

692
00:45:15,278 --> 00:45:18,489
And at night we'll tell each other
what we've done.

693
00:45:19,825 --> 00:45:21,452
Why don't we get married?

694
00:45:22,953 --> 00:45:25,205
I'm asking you to marry me.

695
00:45:25,706 --> 00:45:28,542
Haven't you got married
and divorced enough times?

696
00:45:28,584 --> 00:45:31,044
With you, it would be the first time.

697
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:35,299
We've been living together for two years.

698
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:37,551
We're fine like this.

699
00:45:37,969 --> 00:45:39,220
Don't you think?

700
00:45:41,388 --> 00:45:42,598
It seems you don't

701
00:45:43,766 --> 00:45:46,560
Ernesto Martel offered to
produce the film.

702
00:45:46,602 --> 00:45:48,187
You mother didn't want that.

703
00:45:48,395 --> 00:45:50,565
We were waiting for a grant from
the Minstry...

704
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:53,818
- You want help?
- No, I'll show you.

705
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,987
...and a television pre-sale

706
00:45:56,696 --> 00:45:58,948
But that would take months.

707
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,701
And I was in a real hurry
to start shooting.

708
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:04,412
Just like Audrey!
Spot on, faggot!

709
00:46:04,454 --> 00:46:06,123
Totally Audrey!

710
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:07,290
Divine!

711
00:46:08,583 --> 00:46:10,002
Move closer to the mirror.

712
00:46:15,507 --> 00:46:17,467
Light up your face.

713
00:46:18,093 --> 00:46:19,511
Now look at me in profile.

714
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:22,806
with an exaggerated smile,
like the model.

715
00:46:24,016 --> 00:46:24,933
Like that one?

716
00:46:26,977 --> 00:46:28,061
Yes. Come on.

717
00:46:29,104 --> 00:46:32,107
Open your eyes more
and close your mouth a bit.

718
00:46:32,149 --> 00:46:33,651
Come on. Now.

719
00:46:37,488 --> 00:46:38,614
Very good. Again.

720
00:46:39,448 --> 00:46:41,534
Open your mouth a little more.
Now.

721
00:46:42,493 --> 00:46:43,702
Wonderful.

722
00:46:44,162 --> 00:46:45,538
Again.

723
00:46:47,415 --> 00:46:48,958
- Art!
- Totally!

724
00:46:50,251 --> 00:46:53,797
Now i'd like to try something
much more daring.

725
00:46:53,838 --> 00:46:56,716
A platinum blonde wig.
Something very pop.

726
00:46:56,758 --> 00:46:57,801
I've got one.

727
00:46:58,552 --> 00:47:01,345
I've got a Goldie Hawn type,
with much more volume.

728
00:47:01,388 --> 00:47:03,014
That'll look fabulous.

729
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:05,975
- But she mustn't look like a poodle.
- No?

730
00:47:06,017 --> 00:47:08,853
If she isn't a poodle
she isn't Goldie.

731
00:47:08,895 --> 00:47:12,149
I told you he wouldn't like Goldie, faggot!

732
00:47:12,191 --> 00:47:14,109
He wears it when he gets dressed.

733
00:47:14,734 --> 00:47:16,611
- So, platinum blonde.
- Yes.

734
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:18,571
I'll change your make up.

735
00:47:20,032 --> 00:47:21,074
Get out of the way!

736
00:47:21,449 --> 00:47:23,118
Look, the wig's false,
it's really bad.

737
00:47:23,368 --> 00:47:27,039
It's Kanecalon fiber,
but it looks fabulous.

738
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:28,666
OK, let's have a look.

739
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,959
You'll flip out.

740
00:47:35,798 --> 00:47:37,341
Put these on.

741
00:47:50,479 --> 00:47:52,398
Judit, can you move to your left?

742
00:48:04,786 --> 00:48:05,704
Are you tired?

743
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:13,795
Don't smile,
The wig is false enough.

744
00:48:16,090 --> 00:48:16,923
That's it.
Wonderful.

745
00:48:17,882 --> 00:48:19,969
From the start,
Judit didn't like Lena.

746
00:48:21,053 --> 00:48:23,805
But I like her more every day.

747
00:48:25,474 --> 00:48:27,684
And Ernesto Junior liked me.

748
00:48:28,018 --> 00:48:29,979
and I intended to use that.

749
00:48:30,855 --> 00:48:34,316
His father had asked him to make a
documentary about the shoot.

750
00:48:36,902 --> 00:48:38,613
As for Ernesto Sr.

751
00:48:38,654 --> 00:48:42,450
I'd never met a man
so obsessed by a woman.

752
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:46,537
He was producing the film
in a desperate attempt not to lose Lena.

753
00:48:49,249 --> 00:48:51,626
This is shit!
It's incomprehensible!

754
00:48:54,004 --> 00:48:56,714
In the midst of that
emotional panorama,

755
00:48:57,423 --> 00:48:58,758
we started shooting.

756
00:49:03,346 --> 00:49:06,767
Now think of all the times
you've made gazpacho for Iván.

757
00:49:06,808 --> 00:49:08,769
How he enjoyed it.

758
00:49:09,144 --> 00:49:11,354
And that breaks your heart.

759
00:49:35,462 --> 00:49:39,425
We'll do the first time you come
home after a photo session.

760
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:43,137
As soon as you open the door,
you look over at the answering machine.

761
00:49:44,221 --> 00:49:46,140
If it's flashing, it may be Ivan.

762
00:49:46,474 --> 00:49:47,684
"If it isn't flashing,
it'll be another day of despair

763
00:49:47,725 --> 00:49:51,771
because you've been
looking for him for two days.

764
00:49:51,813 --> 00:49:53,690
All right. OK, OK.

765
00:49:53,981 --> 00:49:56,651
Listen, did you like the
bit with the tomatoes?

766
00:49:56,943 --> 00:49:57,694
Yes a lot.

767
00:49:57,735 --> 00:49:59,196
It moved me.

768
00:49:59,237 --> 00:50:01,656
Me too,
It really moved me.

769
00:50:01,698 --> 00:50:05,118
It's amazing that you could
be moved by tomatoes.

770
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,619
It wasn't the tomatoes

771
00:50:06,661 --> 00:50:09,414
it was the nice things
you were saying to me."

772
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,126
They like each other?

773
00:50:16,004 --> 00:50:17,798
Do you think they like each other?

774
00:50:18,298 --> 00:50:19,216
Me?

775
00:50:19,508 --> 00:50:20,884
I don't know anything.

776
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:23,429
I only look at their lips.

777
00:50:25,264 --> 00:50:26,515
Samples?

778
00:50:27,183 --> 00:50:28,059
What do you think?

779
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:35,774
Cut!

780
00:50:36,275 --> 00:50:37,443
Very good. Print it.

781
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:44,283
- Are you going to do anything?
- No, you can go.

782
00:50:44,325 --> 00:50:46,077
I don't mind staying.

783
00:50:46,285 --> 00:50:49,121
You should go.
I'm going to check some wigs.

784
00:50:49,163 --> 00:50:51,040
Wigs? I love that!

785
00:50:51,082 --> 00:50:55,044
Enough! You've filmed hours of wigs.
This is more of the same.

786
00:50:55,086 --> 00:50:56,254
And Lena?

787
00:50:59,341 --> 00:51:02,970
After we've tried the new wigs
she wants a massage.

788
00:51:03,011 --> 00:51:04,221
She's got a contraction.

789
00:51:04,262 --> 00:51:07,057
I haven't got any contractions.

790
00:51:07,099 --> 00:51:08,100
Couldn't I film it?

791
00:51:08,141 --> 00:51:10,978
Ernesto, please,
don't be such a pain. Go home!

792
00:51:11,812 --> 00:51:12,855
Bye.

793
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:19,402
Edurne...

794
00:51:20,237 --> 00:51:23,240
I'm going to speak to Lena.
I don't want to be interrupted.

795
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:25,743
Don't worry, I'll see to it.

796
00:51:26,118 --> 00:51:27,786
I'll be your watchdog.

797
00:51:48,057 --> 00:51:50,101
Wait.
Is his son out there?

798
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:54,439
No, I sent him home.
Edurne's keeping watch.

799
00:51:59,319 --> 00:52:01,321
Mateo, this is crazy.

800
00:52:57,859 --> 00:52:58,902
Hello.

801
00:52:59,027 --> 00:53:00,195
Hello.

802
00:53:00,298 --> 00:53:01,758
What are you doing?

803
00:53:02,217 --> 00:53:03,134
Nothing.

804
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:05,554
Waiting for you.

805
00:53:05,596 --> 00:53:08,265
I didn't think filmmaking was
such hard work.

806
00:53:09,725 --> 00:53:10,767
Yes. It doesn't stop.

807
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:13,145
It's very absorbing.

808
00:53:13,187 --> 00:53:14,730
Aren't you tired?

809
00:53:15,731 --> 00:53:17,649
Chocolate gives me energy.

810
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,611
I love bitter orange with chocolate.

811
00:53:22,196 --> 00:53:24,406
I meant the shoot, not the chocolate.

812
00:53:25,032 --> 00:53:27,535
Oh, very.
At the end of the week, I'm exhausted.

813
00:53:27,577 --> 00:53:29,453
But I'm happy.

814
00:53:29,996 --> 00:53:32,248
I thought we could take a break.

815
00:53:32,289 --> 00:53:34,917
A weekend, just you and I.

816
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:37,003
in the house on Ibiza.

817
00:53:38,170 --> 00:53:40,340
We rehearse on weekends.

818
00:53:41,007 --> 00:53:43,885
Don't you rehearse during the shoot?

819
00:53:44,344 --> 00:53:46,846
Do you spend
the whole day rehearsing?

820
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:48,806
That's how films are made!

821
00:53:49,099 --> 00:53:52,602
What about our life?
You can't just set it aside for months.

822
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,105
The film sets the rules.

823
00:53:56,273 --> 00:53:59,234
No, I set them.
I'm the producer.

824
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:03,280
- Is there a problem?
- Yes.

825
00:54:03,572 --> 00:54:05,491
It's completely impersonal.

826
00:54:05,783 --> 00:54:09,453
I asked for a graphic set
but this is totally dead!

827
00:54:09,703 --> 00:54:11,121
Shall I speak to Antxon?

828
00:54:11,747 --> 00:54:13,040
No, I'll do it.

829
00:54:13,624 --> 00:54:14,916
What's wrong with you?

830
00:54:15,209 --> 00:54:16,418
You look awful.

831
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,170
Its Diego.

832
00:54:18,754 --> 00:54:22,633
He could hardly breathe all night.
Neither of us got any sleep.

833
00:54:23,259 --> 00:54:24,760
You still don't know what it is?

834
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:27,930
Some doctors say it's asthma,
others that he's allergic.

835
00:54:28,222 --> 00:54:29,849
but we don't know to what.

836
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:32,810
They're still investigating,

837
00:54:33,102 --> 00:54:34,646
but we're desperate.

838
00:54:34,937 --> 00:54:36,898
Take all the time that you need.

839
00:54:37,189 --> 00:54:39,901
Right now,
your son is what matters.

840
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:44,572
Another thing,

841
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:46,949
- I was talking to the producer.
- And?

842
00:54:47,950 --> 00:54:50,537
He's complaining that Lena's
too absorbed by the shooting.

843
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:55,292
How does he think films are made?

844
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:58,921
Ernesto is a business man,
not an artist.

845
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:01,298
No one asked him
to become a producer!

846
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:04,051
It's too late to argue about that.

847
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:11,475
He's taking her to Ibiza this weekend.
So you cannot rehearse.

848
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:14,812
Son of a bitch.

849
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,526
Get rid of the table,
lamps and chairs!

850
00:55:20,818 --> 00:55:23,071
I wanted a graphic set
but it should be alive.

851
00:57:17,980 --> 00:57:19,732
God I look terrible!

852
00:58:09,283 --> 00:58:11,368
You are scared when I touch you

853
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:14,163
but not when you see me dead?

854
00:58:15,289 --> 00:58:17,291
I didn't think you were dead.

855
00:58:17,834 --> 00:58:19,711
I thought you were sleeping.

856
00:58:20,587 --> 00:58:22,254
I usually snore.

857
00:58:23,756 --> 00:58:27,093
If I'd thought you were dead
I wouldn't have got made up for you.

858
00:58:28,177 --> 00:58:31,973
Any man of my age could have a heart attack
after screwing six times.

859
00:58:34,392 --> 00:58:36,228
You're not a man of your age.

860
00:58:41,483 --> 00:58:43,151
I wouldn't mind dying

861
00:58:43,443 --> 00:58:46,696
after fucking you for days,
weeks, months,

862
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:48,490
years, centuries.

863
00:58:50,325 --> 00:58:52,077
I'm crazy about you,

864
00:58:52,494 --> 00:58:54,121
you drive me crazy.

865
00:58:55,038 --> 00:58:56,665
I guess you know that.

866
00:58:57,666 --> 00:59:00,794
Yes.
I think I do.

867
00:59:05,258 --> 00:59:08,511
Look at what I found on the sidewalk.
They fell off your terrace.

868
00:59:08,552 --> 00:59:10,596
They were gifts from Ivan,
I threw them out.

869
00:59:11,305 --> 00:59:13,224
You can't do that, Miss Pina.

870
00:59:13,766 --> 00:59:15,559
You could kill someone.

871
00:59:15,601 --> 00:59:18,980
In Naples, on New Year's Eve,
they even throw out furniture.

872
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:22,692
My grandpa was Neapolitan
and it's in my blood.

873
00:59:22,734 --> 00:59:25,612
But this isn't Naples
and today isn't New Year's Eve.

874
00:59:27,781 --> 00:59:30,742
I was nervous, throwing them out
relaxes me. You keep them.

875
00:59:31,576 --> 00:59:32,911
They'll come in handy.

876
00:59:34,120 --> 00:59:35,163
"Love..."

877
00:59:36,581 --> 00:59:39,168
You say "love", I say "sex"!

878
00:59:39,668 --> 00:59:40,544
Cut!

879
00:59:41,295 --> 00:59:43,338
- Shall we print it?
- Like hell!

880
00:59:44,423 --> 00:59:46,175
I'll fix your make up after, OK?

881
00:59:53,182 --> 00:59:54,599
You're not on form today.

882
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:56,476
I know.

883
00:59:57,352 --> 00:59:58,688
What's wrong?

884
00:59:58,729 --> 01:00:00,355
I'll tell you later.

885
01:00:02,107 --> 01:00:04,109
- Take a sandwich break.
- 30 minutes?

886
01:00:05,403 --> 01:00:07,154
We'll take a 30 minute sandwich break!

887
01:00:07,613 --> 01:00:09,907
Let's clear this a bit and go outside.

888
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:26,257
No lips.

889
01:00:29,595 --> 01:00:32,013
I've had a horrible weekend.

890
01:00:32,514 --> 01:00:35,517
But we didn't rehearse
so that you could rest.

891
01:00:35,851 --> 01:00:36,893
Rest?

892
01:00:37,185 --> 01:00:40,689
I had that son of a bitch
on top of me for 48 hours.

893
01:00:41,147 --> 01:00:44,526
He didn't let up for a second.
The bastard.

894
01:00:45,277 --> 01:00:47,488
I'm living on tranquilizers

895
01:00:48,489 --> 01:00:49,323
No lips.

896
01:00:53,911 --> 01:00:55,788
No, no.
I'll get over it and I'll do it.

897
01:00:55,830 --> 01:00:57,832
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

898
01:00:58,499 --> 01:01:01,418
You have to be witty
and light.

899
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,838
Of course.

900
01:01:04,589 --> 01:01:05,548
Light...

901
01:01:10,136 --> 01:01:13,097
You don't know what it's like
having that monster on top of you

902
01:01:13,139 --> 01:01:14,974
for 48 hours.

903
01:01:15,433 --> 01:01:16,559
It makes me sick.

904
01:01:18,478 --> 01:01:20,230
It's best
if you don't think about it.

905
01:01:20,688 --> 01:01:23,316
It's best if you and I
never talk about Ernesto.

906
01:01:23,774 --> 01:01:24,609
It's best not to

907
01:01:25,068 --> 01:01:26,736
open that can of worms.

908
01:01:30,198 --> 01:01:32,200
What do you do with your notebooks?

909
01:01:33,534 --> 01:01:34,578
I fill them.

910
01:01:34,953 --> 01:01:35,912
And then?

911
01:01:36,287 --> 01:01:37,038
I burn them.

912
01:01:37,413 --> 01:01:39,583
I'd rather the notebooks slept here.

913
01:01:41,001 --> 01:01:41,793
Slept?

914
01:01:42,252 --> 01:01:45,088
Leave them here,
you'll get them back tomorrow.

915
01:01:46,673 --> 01:01:48,217
When you finish,
I'll keep them.

916
01:01:48,759 --> 01:01:50,469
Very well.
Whatever you say.

917
01:01:54,265 --> 01:01:57,809
- What time tomorrow?
- I'll call you when the material is ready.

918
01:01:58,853 --> 01:02:02,273
I presume you are aware of the total
confidentiality of your work.

919
01:02:02,774 --> 01:02:03,816
Of course.

920
01:02:26,381 --> 01:02:30,052
My father was asking why
I don't go with you to yoga.

921
01:02:30,510 --> 01:02:34,556
Tell him that I'm grown up, and free,
and that I've forbidden you to follow me.

922
01:02:35,015 --> 01:02:36,474
I can't tell him that.

923
01:02:36,516 --> 01:02:38,686
Try it.
It would do you good.

924
01:02:38,727 --> 01:02:39,895
I can't.

925
01:02:40,353 --> 01:02:42,815
Do what you like,
but don't come with me.

926
01:02:42,856 --> 01:02:44,692
You're such a pain!

927
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:42,752
What are you doing?

928
01:03:43,794 --> 01:03:44,795
Working.

929
01:03:45,963 --> 01:03:46,881
Turn that off!

930
01:03:47,632 --> 01:03:49,717
Didn't Mateo
forbid you to tape us off the shoot?

931
01:03:50,050 --> 01:03:52,762
My father told me to ignore that,
he wants to see everything.

932
01:03:53,846 --> 01:03:55,848
Neither of you has any scruples!

933
01:03:56,056 --> 01:03:57,683
Fucking leave me alone!

934
01:03:58,309 --> 01:03:59,685
Remember I'm taping you.

935
01:04:01,229 --> 01:04:02,730
Stop, I said.

936
01:04:03,731 --> 01:04:04,565
Stop!

937
01:04:06,317 --> 01:04:08,111
I told you to stop!
Give me the fucking camera!

938
01:04:08,736 --> 01:04:09,570
You're crazy!

939
01:04:10,196 --> 01:04:12,490
- Give it to me!
- Let go! My camera!

940
01:04:36,057 --> 01:04:37,433
Focus on me.

941
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:48,068
Listen carefully.

942
01:04:48,819 --> 01:04:50,445
Yes, I'm talking to you.

943
01:04:51,781 --> 01:04:53,240
I've just been with the man I love.

944
01:04:54,575 --> 01:04:56,952
and I'm happier than I've ever been

945
01:04:58,078 --> 01:05:00,748
beacuse that man loves me too,
a lot.

946
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:05,420
Don't worry,
I'll leave you in peace very soon.

947
01:05:06,379 --> 01:05:08,048
You needn't spy on us anymore.

948
01:05:10,133 --> 01:05:11,801
There's nothing to hide now.

949
01:06:37,723 --> 01:06:40,559
I don't know if you got back a
little late or early.

950
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:42,853
It was raining, we couldn't shoot.

951
01:06:43,354 --> 01:06:44,480
Where are you going?

952
01:06:46,524 --> 01:06:47,483
I am leaving you.

953
01:06:48,484 --> 01:06:49,652
Shouldn't we talk first?

954
01:06:49,986 --> 01:06:51,779
I've said all I had to say to you.

955
01:06:52,071 --> 01:06:53,572
Lena, please!

956
01:06:55,366 --> 01:06:56,200
Goodbye.

957
01:06:57,618 --> 01:06:58,745
Listen to me.

958
01:06:59,120 --> 01:06:59,913
Let go.

959
01:07:39,454 --> 01:07:41,914
Turn over, my love.
I'll help you.

960
01:07:42,957 --> 01:07:44,041
Let me do it.

961
01:07:45,543 --> 01:07:47,837
Relax, I'll help you.

962
01:07:49,755 --> 01:07:51,341
You could have broken something.

963
01:07:51,382 --> 01:07:53,218
I'll take off your shoes.

964
01:07:57,848 --> 01:07:59,474
You'll be more comfortable.

965
01:08:01,309 --> 01:08:03,478
I'll see to everything.
Come on!

966
01:08:05,271 --> 01:08:06,147
Help me.

967
01:08:35,552 --> 01:08:37,763
Sit down, but be careful.

968
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:40,140
My darling.

969
01:08:41,476 --> 01:08:42,685
That's it.

970
01:08:43,143 --> 01:08:44,854
I'll take you to the hospital.

971
01:09:20,932 --> 01:09:24,311
My wife fell down the stairs.
Be careful.

972
01:09:28,565 --> 01:09:29,816
Watch her head.

973
01:09:34,196 --> 01:09:35,072
Easy does it.

974
01:09:35,823 --> 01:09:37,699
Be careful with my legs.

975
01:09:40,745 --> 01:09:42,079
Take her to trauma.

976
01:10:25,123 --> 01:10:28,126
- Can I used the phone?
- Not in here, in the Doctor's office.

977
01:10:28,502 --> 01:10:29,378
It's urgent.

978
01:10:29,420 --> 01:10:31,797
We'll take you there right away.

979
01:10:37,303 --> 01:10:38,888
What's wrong?
Aren't you coming?

980
01:10:39,138 --> 01:10:40,514
No, not tonight.

981
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:42,809
Has something happened?

982
01:10:44,268 --> 01:10:45,687
Something came up unexpectedly.

983
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:48,397
but don't worry,
everything's fine.

984
01:10:49,065 --> 01:10:51,526
Tomorrow is an evening shoot.
Will I see you before?

985
01:10:52,318 --> 01:10:53,903
No, I can't make it.

986
01:10:54,654 --> 01:10:57,281
I've got a lot to do.
I'll see you at the studio.

987
01:10:57,574 --> 01:10:58,783
You sound odd.

988
01:10:59,784 --> 01:11:01,035
There's really nothing wrong?

989
01:11:03,705 --> 01:11:05,290
I'll see you tomorrow.

990
01:11:09,544 --> 01:11:12,214
There they are.
Ask no questions.

991
01:11:21,181 --> 01:11:23,350
- How are you ma'am?
- Fine.

992
01:11:23,809 --> 01:11:25,060
Can I help you?

993
01:11:25,102 --> 01:11:26,687
No, I'm all right,
thank you.

994
01:11:27,187 --> 01:11:28,689
It was nothing.

995
01:11:28,731 --> 01:11:31,734
Martìn, go on ahead and
open the door.

996
01:11:41,494 --> 01:11:43,621
Thank you for your discretion.

997
01:11:46,875 --> 01:11:49,377
Can you take off your glasses, please?

998
01:11:59,846 --> 01:12:01,598
What can i do...

999
01:12:02,140 --> 01:12:03,725
so that you'll forgive me?

1000
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,852
Take me to the studio.

1001
01:12:05,894 --> 01:12:07,145
You shouldn't move.

1002
01:12:07,396 --> 01:12:10,107
If you don't, I'll drag
myself there if I have to.

1003
01:12:10,149 --> 01:12:11,608
What'll you say?

1004
01:12:12,151 --> 01:12:14,987
How will you explain the
cast and the bruises?

1005
01:12:15,529 --> 01:12:16,738
It depends on you.

1006
01:12:22,619 --> 01:12:26,123
I'll do what you want
if you promise to stay with me.

1007
01:12:29,669 --> 01:12:30,920
I'll stay with you.

1008
01:12:31,796 --> 01:12:35,758
if you let Mateo finish the film
however he wishes.

1009
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,261
He'll interrogate you,
he isn't stupid.

1010
01:12:39,387 --> 01:12:40,388
I'll say I tripped.

1011
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:44,309
How can you work
if you can't walk?

1012
01:12:45,018 --> 01:12:46,311
He'll decide that.

1013
01:12:46,686 --> 01:12:49,564
but I want to be sure
you'll respect his decision.

1014
01:12:49,940 --> 01:12:52,650
no matter what it costs
or the time it takes.

1015
01:12:53,526 --> 01:12:54,319
Is that clear?

1016
01:13:15,466 --> 01:13:16,675
I live there.

1017
01:13:27,311 --> 01:13:28,562
That's everything.

1018
01:13:28,938 --> 01:13:31,107
Ernesto will back
whatever you decide.

1019
01:13:31,523 --> 01:13:32,441
Decide what?

1020
01:13:32,817 --> 01:13:35,945
I can't go from a shot of you
walking normally to one in a cast.

1021
01:13:38,072 --> 01:13:39,824
When can you take it off?

1022
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:41,075
In 3 weeks.

1023
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:45,205
May I speak to Lena alone?

1024
01:14:03,348 --> 01:14:04,725
Tell me the truth.

1025
01:14:06,101 --> 01:14:07,978
People don't fall down stairs.

1026
01:14:08,729 --> 01:14:10,147
That only happens in films.

1027
01:14:10,481 --> 01:14:11,857
Keep your voice down.

1028
01:14:12,608 --> 01:14:16,237
We have to finish shooting as soon as we can.
Until then, I can't leave Ernesto.

1029
01:14:16,529 --> 01:14:18,614
Why?
He's a psychopath.

1030
01:14:19,115 --> 01:14:20,783
What more proof do you need?

1031
01:14:35,006 --> 01:14:36,257
I can't leave.

1032
01:14:36,507 --> 01:14:39,636
I promised to stay with him
if he lets you finish the film

1033
01:14:39,886 --> 01:14:42,180
under your conditions.

1034
01:14:44,265 --> 01:14:46,560
There must be a better solution.

1035
01:14:46,893 --> 01:14:47,644
Whatis it?

1036
01:14:48,144 --> 01:14:51,148
The only solution is that I
stay with him until it's finished.

1037
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:53,192
What have you promised exactly?

1038
01:14:53,525 --> 01:14:55,319
To live under the same roof

1039
01:14:55,652 --> 01:14:57,947
in separate bedrooms.

1040
01:14:58,280 --> 01:14:59,656
He's got no rights.

1041
01:14:59,698 --> 01:15:02,034
Do you think he'll accept that?

1042
01:15:02,952 --> 01:15:04,286
I don't know!

1043
01:15:04,536 --> 01:15:07,164
But the sooner we finish the better.

1044
01:15:07,414 --> 01:15:09,083
We mustn't stop now.

1045
01:15:13,587 --> 01:15:15,673
We just have one scene on the stairs.

1046
01:15:17,675 --> 01:15:19,552
We'd have to repeat the ending.

1047
01:15:21,304 --> 01:15:23,681
Retake 23. One, first.

1048
01:15:33,357 --> 01:15:35,568
So you're Ivan's ex-wife?

1049
01:15:35,860 --> 01:15:38,947
the one who's been
in a mental hospital for 20 years.

1050
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,327
Yes, but I'm not
in a mental hospital now.

1051
01:15:44,994 --> 01:15:46,580
I'm here with you.

1052
01:15:47,456 --> 01:15:49,207
On top of the stairs.

1053
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:52,711
From the note, it seems
You're anxious to see him.

1054
01:15:53,712 --> 01:15:55,464
Yes, but you go first.

1055
01:15:56,465 --> 01:15:58,133
You're the one in a hurry.

1056
01:15:58,467 --> 01:16:00,719
I've been waiting 20 years.

1057
01:16:01,971 --> 01:16:02,887
Go on.

1058
01:16:13,983 --> 01:16:15,651
As I was saying,

1059
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:20,531
after I split up with my husband
I went out on the street.

1060
01:16:20,865 --> 01:16:22,157
and there was a guy eyeing me,
good looking,

1061
01:16:22,492 --> 01:16:24,994
his ass...
his feet...

1062
01:16:25,661 --> 01:16:28,164
I brought him home
and screwed him several times.

1063
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:31,751
I'm very interested in sex
as a social matter.

1064
01:16:32,502 --> 01:16:33,753
- How was it?
- In bed?

1065
01:16:33,794 --> 01:16:36,297
Divine! A virtuoso!
I've never seen anything like it.

1066
01:16:36,339 --> 01:16:37,423
Incredible.

1067
01:16:37,757 --> 01:16:38,633
This is the good take.

1068
01:16:38,884 --> 01:16:40,676
His big toe!

1069
01:16:42,929 --> 01:16:45,641
Every morning, Lena arrived
at the shoot exhausted.

1070
01:16:46,767 --> 01:16:48,309
By sheer repetition,

1071
01:16:48,644 --> 01:16:51,938
there was always a take
in which she managed to do it well.

1072
01:16:52,648 --> 01:16:55,776
Living with Martel
had become hell.

1073
01:16:56,402 --> 01:16:58,279
Lena didn't say anything
but it was obvious.

1074
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:02,533
When shooting finished
I begged her to leave him.

1075
01:17:02,783 --> 01:17:05,161
but she was scared for the film.

1076
01:17:05,786 --> 01:17:09,957
She didn't want to leave him until
I'd chosen all the good takes.

1077
01:17:13,419 --> 01:17:14,837
It's Magdalena.

1078
01:17:15,212 --> 01:17:16,338
Is something wrong?

1079
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:19,466
No, I'm down below.
I've got no money for the taxi.

1080
01:17:19,508 --> 01:17:21,177
I'm coming down.

1081
01:17:22,470 --> 01:17:23,304
I'll be right back.

1082
01:17:43,616 --> 01:17:44,952
She's in the washroom.

1083
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:56,004
What's happened?

1084
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,343
We had a terrible fight.

1085
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:04,972
He tore off my clothes
and threw me out on the street.

1086
01:18:05,848 --> 01:18:08,892
Give the taxi driver a tip.

1087
01:18:09,227 --> 01:18:10,728
He lent me his jacket, otherwise...

1088
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:12,896
Son of a bitch!

1089
01:18:13,356 --> 01:18:15,399
We'll report him
to the police right now.

1090
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:20,363
Take me far away from here, please.

1091
01:18:22,782 --> 01:18:23,992
Yes, of course.
Whatever you want.

1092
01:18:59,903 --> 01:19:01,154
Give me the camera!

1093
01:19:45,575 --> 01:19:46,826
What are you writing?

1094
01:19:48,828 --> 01:19:50,705
"The secret of Golfo Beach."

1095
01:19:52,082 --> 01:19:54,709
When I took the photo
I didn't see the couple kissing.

1096
01:19:56,086 --> 01:19:57,587
And what's the secret?

1097
01:19:58,338 --> 01:19:59,214
I don't know.

1098
01:20:00,090 --> 01:20:02,217
I have to write it to find out.

1099
01:20:05,846 --> 01:20:07,389
We're that couple.

1100
01:20:18,234 --> 01:20:19,360
What is it?

1101
01:20:21,487 --> 01:20:23,156
It looks like a leg.

1102
01:20:25,158 --> 01:20:26,993
It's an arm.

1103
01:20:28,661 --> 01:20:30,371
and two other legs.

1104
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:35,168
Two people, just like when they died.

1105
01:20:35,501 --> 01:20:37,253
A man and a woman.

1106
01:20:38,379 --> 01:20:40,632
They died together.

1107
01:20:45,262 --> 01:20:46,680
What is it?

1108
01:20:46,722 --> 01:20:48,265
I don't know

1109
01:20:49,141 --> 01:20:49,975
Catherine,

1110
01:20:50,184 --> 01:20:51,768
what happened?

1111
01:20:52,061 --> 01:20:54,896
Alex, it's too much.

1112
01:21:19,547 --> 01:21:21,799
Before we knew it,
a month had passed.

1113
01:21:22,049 --> 01:21:24,552
Sooner or later,
we'd have to go back.

1114
01:21:24,844 --> 01:21:26,721
But we kept putting it off.

1115
01:21:27,055 --> 01:21:29,557
I was only worried
about your mother and you.

1116
01:21:29,599 --> 01:21:32,060
I hadn't even said goodbye to you,

1117
01:21:32,102 --> 01:21:35,063
and you had all those allergies
when we left.

1118
01:22:16,022 --> 01:22:17,398
OPENING SOON

1119
01:22:20,652 --> 01:22:22,028
GIRLS AND SUITCASES

1120
01:22:33,873 --> 01:22:36,043
I was wondering when he'd turn up.

1121
01:22:36,376 --> 01:22:39,129
But they can't open the film
so soon, can they?

1122
01:22:39,379 --> 01:22:41,924
It's a trick so that we'll go back.

1123
01:22:41,965 --> 01:22:44,635
All the ad needed
was the word "WANTED".

1124
01:22:44,927 --> 01:22:46,136
What'll we do?

1125
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:48,556
Nothing.
Fuck him!

1126
01:23:00,901 --> 01:23:03,321
PREMIERE TONIGHT

1127
01:23:04,322 --> 01:23:05,531
DISASTER

1128
01:23:38,190 --> 01:23:39,108
What does it say?

1129
01:23:41,318 --> 01:23:44,613
That the only intelligent thing we did
was not attend the premiere.

1130
01:23:45,948 --> 01:23:47,324
Bastards!

1131
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:02,089
Judit?

1132
01:24:03,466 --> 01:24:04,342
It's me.

1133
01:24:05,593 --> 01:24:07,095
I need to talk to you.

1134
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:09,639
Call me, please.

1135
01:24:10,515 --> 01:24:11,975
I'll give you the number:

1136
01:24:14,727 --> 01:24:15,645
28 first.

1137
01:24:15,979 --> 01:24:19,482
Sorry: 28845132.

1138
01:24:20,984 --> 01:24:24,279
Ask for Harry Caine.
I'm registered under that name.

1139
01:24:25,864 --> 01:24:26,990
Are you there?

1140
01:24:30,035 --> 01:24:31,495
I'll be expecting your call.

1141
01:24:32,788 --> 01:24:34,415
Mom didn't call you back?

1142
01:24:35,749 --> 01:24:36,750
Why?

1143
01:24:39,628 --> 01:24:41,380
She was angry, I guess.

1144
01:24:42,923 --> 01:24:46,760
Even so, she should've told you
what was happening.

1145
01:24:49,013 --> 01:24:52,141
But she didn't
and we've never talked about it.

1146
01:24:54,769 --> 01:24:56,395
Weren't you curious?

1147
01:24:56,688 --> 01:24:59,273
Me?
I was dying of curiosity!

1148
01:24:59,524 --> 01:25:02,819
For two days I kept calling
your mother and the editor,

1149
01:25:03,152 --> 01:25:04,696
but neither one answered.

1150
01:25:06,406 --> 01:25:08,200
So I decided to go back to Madrid

1151
01:25:08,533 --> 01:25:11,077
and see with my own eyes
what was happening.

1152
01:25:16,166 --> 01:25:18,418
It's the first time we've been apart.

1153
01:25:19,544 --> 01:25:21,839
I'll be back on the weekend.

1154
01:25:23,924 --> 01:25:26,426
But if you're worried
come with me.

1155
01:25:27,469 --> 01:25:28,929
No, I'm better here.

1156
01:25:30,180 --> 01:25:31,599
Madrid scares me.

1157
01:26:44,757 --> 01:26:48,136
Magdalena's death didn't surprise us
locked in an embrace,

1158
01:26:48,177 --> 01:26:49,887
as we'd dreamed,

1159
01:26:50,388 --> 01:26:52,640
but sitting in separate seats.

1160
01:26:53,891 --> 01:26:56,144
It even surprised me
by leaving me alive.

1161
01:26:58,771 --> 01:26:59,647
Mateo...

1162
01:27:01,649 --> 01:27:02,901
Say something.

1163
01:27:05,194 --> 01:27:06,696
Mateo is dead Judit.

1164
01:27:09,198 --> 01:27:10,575
Don't say that.

1165
01:27:11,159 --> 01:27:14,454
We address him by his name
but he refuses to answer.

1166
01:27:14,788 --> 01:27:16,456
He insists that Mateo is dead.

1167
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:21,295
His work revolves around images.

1168
01:27:23,047 --> 01:27:25,799
I guess that for him,
living in the dark

1169
01:27:26,091 --> 01:27:27,092
is death.

1170
01:27:29,929 --> 01:27:31,430
Is there any chance that he'll see?

1171
01:27:32,097 --> 01:27:33,057
None.

1172
01:27:33,974 --> 01:27:38,437
He has what we call
cortical blindness and it's irreversible.

1173
01:27:40,189 --> 01:27:42,066
That's very good.

1174
01:27:47,488 --> 01:27:49,574
There are some steps to the right.

1175
01:27:52,577 --> 01:27:53,744
But not here.

1176
01:27:54,078 --> 01:27:55,830
Move forward a bit more.

1177
01:27:58,374 --> 01:28:00,710
I'll guide you to the edge.

1178
01:28:01,502 --> 01:28:02,378
Come on.

1179
01:28:04,464 --> 01:28:05,966
That's it.

1180
01:28:07,884 --> 01:28:09,344
We're almost there.

1181
01:28:12,889 --> 01:28:15,350
Now there are a few steps
down to the car.

1182
01:28:15,601 --> 01:28:18,604
We'll take them carefully,
they're very high.

1183
01:28:18,854 --> 01:28:21,482
They're 10 inches,
I measured them earlier.

1184
01:28:21,773 --> 01:28:22,983
Wait, I'll put down your bag.

1185
01:28:25,611 --> 01:28:26,528
Come on.

1186
01:28:31,158 --> 01:28:32,118
Let's go.

1187
01:28:32,868 --> 01:28:36,163
The first step is the hardest,
but I'm holding on to you.

1188
01:28:41,502 --> 01:28:43,379
Yes, slide your feet along.

1189
01:28:44,130 --> 01:28:45,256
That's it, let's go.

1190
01:28:45,548 --> 01:28:46,633
Down.

1191
01:28:51,763 --> 01:28:52,805
Very good.

1192
01:28:53,640 --> 01:28:56,559
Now, the second one.
That's right.

1193
01:29:01,398 --> 01:29:02,690
A little more.

1194
01:29:05,027 --> 01:29:06,778
That's it, no more steps

1195
01:29:08,030 --> 01:29:10,783
Did you go to see Lena's mother
in the village?

1196
01:29:13,284 --> 01:29:14,911
What did she say?

1197
01:29:17,539 --> 01:29:21,418
She was very grateful to Ernesto
for taking care of everything.

1198
01:29:25,839 --> 01:29:27,048
- Is she there?
- Yes.

1199
01:29:28,467 --> 01:29:30,302
They buried her with her father.

1200
01:29:31,845 --> 01:29:33,055
Did you see the grave?

1201
01:29:38,435 --> 01:29:39,561
What's it like?

1202
01:29:42,314 --> 01:29:43,482
Simple.

1203
01:29:43,941 --> 01:29:46,068
Her mother didn't want
anything fancy.

1204
01:29:56,704 --> 01:29:58,331
Look, mom, the sea!

1205
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:02,502
We're in Famara.

1206
01:30:03,336 --> 01:30:05,505
Stop, please.
I'll get out here.

1207
01:30:05,838 --> 01:30:06,631
No, wait a minute.

1208
01:30:06,673 --> 01:30:08,383
How can you get out?

1209
01:30:09,717 --> 01:30:12,345
Go to Reception
and do what you have to do.

1210
01:30:13,513 --> 01:30:14,890
I'll wait for you on the beach.

1211
01:30:15,223 --> 01:30:16,850
I want to get out here too.

1212
01:30:17,142 --> 01:30:18,852
How can you get out in this wind?

1213
01:30:19,144 --> 01:30:21,855
- I don't mind the wind.
- Be quiet, Diego!

1214
01:30:25,484 --> 01:30:26,652
Stop the car please.

1215
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,878
Mom, please, can I stay?

1216
01:30:44,170 --> 01:30:47,131
It's the first time I've seen the sea.

1217
01:30:47,506 --> 01:30:48,507
- Please.
- All right.

1218
01:30:48,883 --> 01:30:50,176
- Wrap yourself up.
- OK.

1219
01:30:50,509 --> 01:30:51,928
And don't go near the water.

1220
01:30:52,261 --> 01:30:53,512
Give him your hand.

1221
01:30:53,930 --> 01:30:55,389
Don't let go of him, please.

1222
01:30:57,266 --> 01:30:58,893
You wrap up too.

1223
01:31:07,402 --> 01:31:09,904
Careful, there's a step.

1224
01:31:20,290 --> 01:31:21,291
Let's go.

1225
01:31:31,677 --> 01:31:33,345
Wait for me here, please.

1226
01:33:53,698 --> 01:33:54,616
Harry Caine!

1227
01:33:57,995 --> 01:33:59,246
We're here!

1228
01:34:11,509 --> 01:34:13,260
We have to go, Harry.

1229
01:34:14,386 --> 01:34:16,138
Come on, Dieguito!

1230
01:34:17,348 --> 01:34:18,849
Give me your hand.

1231
01:34:21,477 --> 01:34:23,646
Can't we stay a bit longer?

1232
01:34:24,730 --> 01:34:28,234
No, you have to obey your mother.
You've had enough wind for today.

1233
01:34:33,364 --> 01:34:34,657
I'm here, Harry.

1234
01:34:35,867 --> 01:34:38,244
Careful you don't trip.

1235
01:34:53,260 --> 01:34:55,179
Do you remember Famara?

1236
01:34:56,513 --> 01:34:59,808
Perfectly. It was the first time
I saw the sea.

1237
01:35:01,018 --> 01:35:04,438
I remember the kites
and a dog that was barking.

1238
01:35:06,273 --> 01:35:08,943
I remember the dog barking too.

1239
01:35:18,536 --> 01:35:19,286
What are you doing?

1240
01:35:20,329 --> 01:35:23,040
I'm trying to reconstruct
some of your photos.

1241
01:35:41,434 --> 01:35:43,186
I've got one that's almost complete.

1242
01:35:47,357 --> 01:35:48,942
What do you want to see
to cheer you up?

1243
01:35:49,317 --> 01:35:51,236
I'd like to hear
Jeanne Moreau's voice.

1244
01:35:51,695 --> 01:35:52,821
I don't have her number.

1245
01:35:53,572 --> 01:35:56,116
Find "Elevator to the Gallows",
by Louis Malle.

1246
01:35:57,868 --> 01:35:59,119
Fritz Lang...

1247
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:01,622
Jules Dassin, Nicholas Ray...

1248
01:36:01,663 --> 01:36:03,207
Look up above.

1249
01:36:05,959 --> 01:36:09,338
Fanny and Alexander, Fellini 81/2,
Magnificent Obsession...

1250
01:36:09,881 --> 01:36:12,258
Elevator to the Gallows!
Here it is.

1251
01:36:12,591 --> 01:36:13,884
I've never seen it.

1252
01:36:14,093 --> 01:36:15,635
I hope you like it.

1253
01:36:20,349 --> 01:36:21,851
How can I throw it out?

1254
01:36:22,727 --> 01:36:24,645
The police have to find it...

1255
01:36:24,979 --> 01:36:27,357
Leave it!
It's "Girls and Suitcases".

1256
01:36:28,107 --> 01:36:29,525
I don't understand.

1257
01:36:30,901 --> 01:36:32,152
It's simple babe.

1258
01:36:33,112 --> 01:36:36,907
If the cops find 30 pounds
of uncut cocaine in my house

1259
01:36:37,242 --> 01:36:38,493
they could arrest me.

1260
01:36:40,620 --> 01:36:44,875
But I don't understand how
that suitcase appeared in your house.

1261
01:36:47,043 --> 01:36:48,503
Doesn't it sound odd?

1262
01:36:52,758 --> 01:36:54,425
As I was saying,

1263
01:36:56,261 --> 01:36:58,389
after I split up with my husband

1264
01:36:59,264 --> 01:37:00,641
I went out on the street
and there was a guy eyeing me,

1265
01:37:00,891 --> 01:37:04,270
good-looking.
his ass... his feet...

1266
01:37:05,771 --> 01:37:07,773
I brought him home
and screwed him several times.

1267
01:37:08,023 --> 01:37:10,026
They're completely off key.

1268
01:37:10,276 --> 01:37:11,318
In bed?

1269
01:37:12,444 --> 01:37:13,529
A virtuoso.

1270
01:37:13,946 --> 01:37:16,073
Look, my hairs are standing on end.

1271
01:37:16,115 --> 01:37:19,035
How could I have chosen those takes?
They're both terrible!

1272
01:37:23,039 --> 01:37:24,540
What do you want to do today?

1273
01:37:25,792 --> 01:37:26,793
I have to go home.

1274
01:37:27,585 --> 01:37:31,964
Mom left a message that she's coming back today,
to celebrate your birthday.

1275
01:37:33,466 --> 01:37:34,676
It's my birthday?

1276
01:37:35,802 --> 01:37:37,053
That's what she says.

1277
01:37:37,804 --> 01:37:38,805
If Judit says so...

1278
01:37:40,056 --> 01:37:41,057
Happy Birthday!

1279
01:37:41,683 --> 01:37:43,851
I'll have to take you out to dinner.

1280
01:37:49,732 --> 01:37:51,443
Anyone at home?

1281
01:37:55,447 --> 01:37:56,699
Love,

1282
01:37:57,449 --> 01:37:58,992
I was dying to see you.

1283
01:38:02,830 --> 01:38:03,831
What's up?

1284
01:38:04,373 --> 01:38:05,833
Do they show a lot?

1285
01:38:07,376 --> 01:38:10,213
Today I didn't even have time
to wipe my ass.

1286
01:38:10,963 --> 01:38:12,465
Don't look at me like that.

1287
01:38:12,506 --> 01:38:14,258
I thought you'd be used to it.

1288
01:38:14,592 --> 01:38:15,634
Yes, I'm sorry.

1289
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:19,138
You're so handsome!

1290
01:38:20,098 --> 01:38:22,766
Are you all right?
I was worried about you.

1291
01:38:23,226 --> 01:38:24,268
I'm fine.

1292
01:38:24,728 --> 01:38:26,520
Mateo looked after me day and night.

1293
01:38:26,855 --> 01:38:27,731
Mateo?

1294
01:38:28,857 --> 01:38:30,483
Don't you call him Harry anymore?

1295
01:38:35,530 --> 01:38:37,407
We have to buy him
a birthday present.

1296
01:38:39,868 --> 01:38:42,371
What have you been doing
all this time?

1297
01:38:42,621 --> 01:38:43,538
Nothing...

1298
01:38:43,872 --> 01:38:46,291
Watching films and talking.

1299
01:38:47,167 --> 01:38:48,043
Talking?

1300
01:38:50,379 --> 01:38:51,130
About what?

1301
01:38:52,131 --> 01:38:53,382
Mom, for God's sake!

1302
01:39:00,430 --> 01:39:02,141
And what was wrong with you?

1303
01:39:02,391 --> 01:39:04,560
I'm not sure if
I believe the gastoenteritis.

1304
01:39:04,894 --> 01:39:07,271
You used it as an excuse in a script.

1305
01:39:07,688 --> 01:39:10,941
I had an accident, but I'd rather
not talk about it now.

1306
01:39:12,067 --> 01:39:13,319
An accident?

1307
01:39:14,153 --> 01:39:15,696
What kind of accident?

1308
01:39:16,781 --> 01:39:20,201
- It's hard to explain.
- Try, I'm not so dumb!

1309
01:39:20,535 --> 01:39:22,912
We'll leave it for another day.
I'm fine now.

1310
01:39:25,165 --> 01:39:27,583
I'm going to buy some DVDs for Mateo.

1311
01:40:03,996 --> 01:40:07,457
I don't know what you've talked about
all these days,

1312
01:40:09,209 --> 01:40:12,713
but I do know what I haven't told you
in all these years.

1313
01:40:13,213 --> 01:40:15,215
I never asked you.

1314
01:40:15,257 --> 01:40:18,344
But you'll have asked yourself
a thousand times.

1315
01:40:19,136 --> 01:40:21,389
This is your birthday present, Mateo.

1316
01:40:23,224 --> 01:40:25,101
It's also for you, Diego.

1317
01:40:30,606 --> 01:40:34,652
After you two disappeared,
Ernesto Sr. only wanted revenge.

1318
01:40:34,986 --> 01:40:35,987
- Forget it, Judit.
- No.

1319
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,741
- You've had a bad day today
- That's why.

1320
01:40:40,033 --> 01:40:42,494
I'd like to end it better.

1321
01:40:44,370 --> 01:40:47,499
Ernesto had a crazy plan
to get his revenge on you,

1322
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:51,378
but to carry it out
he had to bribe us,

1323
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:54,506
at least, me and Luis, the editor.

1324
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:59,261
Even though it was crazy,
there was no problem.

1325
01:40:59,678 --> 01:41:02,139
We both sold out
without any objection.

1326
01:41:02,431 --> 01:41:03,515
Luis and I.

1327
01:41:05,434 --> 01:41:06,518
With me,

1328
01:41:07,019 --> 01:41:09,689
he was courteous enough
to provide me with an alibi.

1329
01:41:10,773 --> 01:41:14,318
He suggested I went to the U.S.
for six weeks, to the Mayo Clinic

1330
01:41:14,652 --> 01:41:17,947
so Diego could be cured
of his aspergilosis.

1331
01:41:18,280 --> 01:41:21,283
That way,
I wouldn't be present while he...

1332
01:41:21,909 --> 01:41:23,661
destroyed your film.

1333
01:41:25,079 --> 01:41:27,165
Because that was his plan:

1334
01:41:28,040 --> 01:41:30,085
To reduce the film to rubble.

1335
01:41:36,299 --> 01:41:38,051
I prefered to stay in Madrid

1336
01:41:38,343 --> 01:41:40,095
and have Diego cured here.

1337
01:41:40,804 --> 01:41:42,681
I wanted to witness everything.

1338
01:41:42,973 --> 01:41:44,557
If I was to betray you,

1339
01:41:44,808 --> 01:41:47,227
I wanted to suffer the price
I had to pay.

1340
01:41:51,231 --> 01:41:52,733
It was torture

1341
01:41:53,609 --> 01:41:56,820
seeing how Ernesto chose
all the worst takes

1342
01:41:56,862 --> 01:41:58,322
and how Luis edited them,

1343
01:41:58,364 --> 01:42:01,074
turning your film into a monster.

1344
01:42:03,202 --> 01:42:06,956
The only way to bear all that
was to suffer more.

1345
01:42:08,249 --> 01:42:11,961
I sold myself to Ernesto
out of pain and jealousy.

1346
01:42:12,754 --> 01:42:14,505
I couldn't bear or forgive

1347
01:42:14,547 --> 01:42:18,092
that you left with Lena
without saying a word.

1348
01:42:19,218 --> 01:42:22,847
With my treachery, I got my revenge
on you, on her and on myself.

1349
01:42:25,016 --> 01:42:27,101
The only innocent one was Diego.

1350
01:42:28,978 --> 01:42:30,355
Forgive me my love,

1351
01:42:31,147 --> 01:42:34,234
for how bitter I've been
all these years.

1352
01:42:35,652 --> 01:42:38,155
No one deserves to grow up with that.

1353
01:42:55,548 --> 01:42:57,758
Another gin and tonic, please.

1354
01:43:07,143 --> 01:43:08,644
Don't look at me like that.

1355
01:43:34,087 --> 01:43:36,798
Don't go on.
It isn't necessary.

1356
01:43:38,592 --> 01:43:41,470
Now that you're calling yourself
Mateo again, I've got no excuse.

1357
01:43:41,803 --> 01:43:43,430
You've told us everything.

1358
01:43:46,808 --> 01:43:47,852
No, not everything.

1359
01:43:56,944 --> 01:44:00,615
No one knew where you were.
We had no idea.

1360
01:44:01,699 --> 01:44:03,576
Ernesto organized all that,

1361
01:44:03,826 --> 01:44:06,829
the premiere, all that fuss,
so that you'd react.

1362
01:44:07,372 --> 01:44:11,334
His revenge was meaningless
if neither of you responded.

1363
01:44:12,835 --> 01:44:16,089
He asked me constantly
about your whereabouts

1364
01:44:16,381 --> 01:44:19,592
but I knew nothing either,
which was true.

1365
01:44:19,885 --> 01:44:23,596
That's why I didn't wan't to call you,
so as not to complicate your life.

1366
01:44:25,098 --> 01:44:28,476
Ernesto hired various detectives
to look for you.

1367
01:44:29,728 --> 01:44:31,647
But before they could find you.

1368
01:44:32,773 --> 01:44:34,107
You called me

1369
01:44:35,025 --> 01:44:37,110
two days after the premiere.

1370
01:44:39,863 --> 01:44:44,034
I was too ashamed to answer

1371
01:44:45,161 --> 01:44:47,997
and too dazed.
I still am.

1372
01:44:50,791 --> 01:44:53,627
When Ernesto asked me
about you again,

1373
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,630
I don't know why,

1374
01:44:57,882 --> 01:45:00,134
I gave him the number in Famara.

1375
01:45:04,556 --> 01:45:07,684
He sent his son
to look for you on Lanzarote.

1376
01:45:16,151 --> 01:45:19,571
It was Ernesto Jr.
who found you after the accident

1377
01:45:20,155 --> 01:45:21,656
and called the hospital.

1378
01:45:21,949 --> 01:45:24,076
Did he have anything
to do with the accident?

1379
01:45:25,911 --> 01:45:27,788
But I keep thinking

1380
01:45:27,830 --> 01:45:30,415
that if I hadn't given
that number to his father

1381
01:45:30,666 --> 01:45:32,960
perhaps nothing would have happened.

1382
01:45:36,088 --> 01:45:37,465
Why do you think that?

1383
01:45:40,175 --> 01:45:41,093
I don't know.

1384
01:45:42,345 --> 01:45:43,971
A guilty conscience, I suppose.

1385
01:45:44,305 --> 01:45:45,431
Well, that's enough!

1386
01:45:45,723 --> 01:45:48,559
14 years with a guilty conscience
is enough.

1387
01:46:16,338 --> 01:46:17,964
Wait, I'll help you down.

1388
01:46:20,884 --> 01:46:21,968
Good night.

1389
01:46:29,518 --> 01:46:31,228
Call if you need anything.

1390
01:46:57,921 --> 01:46:58,756
Diego...

1391
01:46:58,797 --> 01:47:01,550
Is not available.
Leave a message.

1392
01:47:03,177 --> 01:47:04,178
Hey Diego, it's Mateo.

1393
01:47:07,390 --> 01:47:09,142
I'm sorry to call so early.

1394
01:47:10,059 --> 01:47:12,020
Tell your mother to call me
when she can.

1395
01:47:46,055 --> 01:47:47,431
Harry, why so early?

1396
01:47:47,682 --> 01:47:49,099
I couldn't sleep.

1397
01:47:49,809 --> 01:47:50,851
Coffee and toast?

1398
01:47:51,185 --> 01:47:52,437
Yes, but first would you

1399
01:47:52,687 --> 01:47:54,939
call this number for me?

1400
01:47:57,442 --> 01:47:58,818
Ray X?

1401
01:48:06,201 --> 01:48:07,202
Here.

1402
01:48:08,078 --> 01:48:09,495
I'll get your coffee.

1403
01:48:12,082 --> 01:48:12,999
Who is this?

1404
01:48:13,333 --> 01:48:14,751
Sorry to disturb you.

1405
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:16,837
This is Mateo Blanco.

1406
01:48:32,478 --> 01:48:33,895
Look at this!

1407
01:48:34,896 --> 01:48:36,732
You have to start the day well.

1408
01:48:40,111 --> 01:48:41,362
How do you feel?

1409
01:48:41,863 --> 01:48:44,240
A little bit hung over
but OK.

1410
01:48:45,366 --> 01:48:48,244
I think the catharsis last night
did me good.

1411
01:48:48,995 --> 01:48:51,539
- Let me help you
- No, sit down.

1412
01:48:57,879 --> 01:49:00,382
Yesterday I had one more thing
to tell you.

1413
01:49:00,673 --> 01:49:03,176
Tell me later.
We'll have breakfast now.

1414
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:06,638
If I don't tell you now,
I may never tell you.

1415
01:49:08,556 --> 01:49:10,392
At the end of the 80s

1416
01:49:10,934 --> 01:49:13,520
Mateo and I,
had a love affair.

1417
01:49:14,897 --> 01:49:16,523
I thought so,

1418
01:49:16,774 --> 01:49:18,566
even before the catharsis last night.

1419
01:49:20,277 --> 01:49:21,695
- You did?
- It's obvious!

1420
01:49:21,737 --> 01:49:24,072
The same curtains
in your bedroom and in his,

1421
01:49:24,114 --> 01:49:26,158
souvenirs of Mexico and the Caribbean
in both houses,

1422
01:49:26,409 --> 01:49:27,535
the crosses...

1423
01:49:29,787 --> 01:49:31,789
There's something else you don't know.

1424
01:49:34,792 --> 01:49:36,419
Mateo is your father.

1425
01:49:37,586 --> 01:49:38,921
My father?

1426
01:49:42,425 --> 01:49:43,801
And the fleeting lover?

1427
01:49:44,677 --> 01:49:46,554
My supposed biological father?

1428
01:49:47,430 --> 01:49:48,681
Did you make him up?

1429
01:49:50,058 --> 01:49:51,600
I can hide things,

1430
01:49:51,935 --> 01:49:54,187
but I'm incapable
of making things up.

1431
01:49:55,313 --> 01:49:57,315
The fleeting lover existed.

1432
01:49:57,691 --> 01:49:59,818
We had an affair.
He was gay

1433
01:50:00,318 --> 01:50:02,487
and the affair was very brief.

1434
01:50:05,740 --> 01:50:07,201
Does Mateo know?

1435
01:50:08,368 --> 01:50:09,703
Are you crazy?

1436
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:12,955
At the time he asked me
and I denied it, of course.

1437
01:50:13,706 --> 01:50:15,583
I didn't want
to pressure him

1438
01:50:15,875 --> 01:50:17,752
I didn't want that
to change our relationship.

1439
01:50:18,086 --> 01:50:20,505
And I'd never asked him
if he wanted to be a father.

1440
01:50:22,090 --> 01:50:23,008
Fuck!

1441
01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:25,010
So Mateo is my father...

1442
01:50:27,512 --> 01:50:29,848
By the way,
he rang early this morning.

1443
01:50:31,016 --> 01:50:32,476
Mateo? What did he want?

1444
01:50:32,851 --> 01:50:33,977
For you to call him.

1445
01:50:34,269 --> 01:50:35,896
Why didn't you wake me?

1446
01:50:36,229 --> 01:50:39,358
Because after last night you
needed to rest

1447
01:50:39,608 --> 01:50:41,152
and he didn't say it was urgent.

1448
01:50:41,485 --> 01:50:43,028
Pass me the phone.

1449
01:50:50,619 --> 01:50:54,040
Diego told me you called.
Are you OK? Do you need anything?

1450
01:50:54,415 --> 01:50:55,792
No, I'm not OK.

1451
01:50:56,125 --> 01:50:58,169
And yes, I do need something.

1452
01:50:58,753 --> 01:51:01,005
The 40,000 meters of negative

1453
01:51:01,047 --> 01:51:03,132
we shot in my last film, to edit it.

1454
01:51:04,509 --> 01:51:05,635
I'm at Ernesto Jr.'s house.

1455
01:51:06,260 --> 01:51:09,889
and I've found out that
the material was destroyed in '94.

1456
01:51:11,140 --> 01:51:12,934
I imagined something like that

1457
01:51:13,560 --> 01:51:15,187
but I didn't think
they'd do it so soon.

1458
01:51:15,229 --> 01:51:16,688
Why are you in Ernesto's house?

1459
01:51:17,064 --> 01:51:18,690
I think I'll blackmail him.

1460
01:51:19,649 --> 01:51:21,818
We need money
and he's got lots to spare.

1461
01:51:21,860 --> 01:51:24,279
I don't want Diego
going back to that damn bar.

1462
01:51:24,571 --> 01:51:26,281
I want to pay him a salary.

1463
01:51:28,951 --> 01:51:30,327
Don't be crazy!

1464
01:51:30,786 --> 01:51:33,330
There's no one else
to accuse of Magdalena's death.

1465
01:51:37,418 --> 01:51:39,169
Wait, I've got something to tell you.

1466
01:51:39,211 --> 01:51:41,839
Last night you said enough.

1467
01:51:42,172 --> 01:51:43,424
Listen to me!

1468
01:51:44,467 --> 01:51:46,677
I was production manager
on the film.

1469
01:51:46,969 --> 01:51:49,847
the only person with access
to the lab and the material.

1470
01:51:51,432 --> 01:51:55,436
After giving Ernesto's order
to destroy it, I intercepted it

1471
01:51:56,062 --> 01:51:56,938
I've got it all at home.

1472
01:51:58,231 --> 01:51:59,565
You're lying.

1473
01:52:00,566 --> 01:52:03,737
I didn't tell you last night because
I didn't know you wanted to edit it.

1474
01:52:04,613 --> 01:52:05,989
I took it all,

1475
01:52:06,823 --> 01:52:10,577
the double takes, the interneg,
the sound tapes, everything!

1476
01:52:10,952 --> 01:52:12,579
You can have it all.

1477
01:52:13,079 --> 01:52:14,080
That changes everything.

1478
01:52:14,122 --> 01:52:15,874
Get out of there, Mateo

1479
01:52:16,250 --> 01:52:17,876
and leave Ernesto in peace.

1480
01:52:18,210 --> 01:52:19,586
He's got nothing to do with this.

1481
01:52:19,836 --> 01:52:22,464
He still has to tell me
why he was in Lanzarote.

1482
01:52:22,714 --> 01:52:25,009
Bye, Judit.
I'll call you later.

1483
01:52:33,392 --> 01:52:35,102
Ernesto and his camera.

1484
01:52:36,854 --> 01:52:38,355
You remind me of a Peeping Tom

1485
01:52:40,983 --> 01:52:42,359
Yes,
but I never wanted to kill you.

1486
01:52:43,110 --> 01:52:44,487
I'm not so sure.

1487
01:52:47,490 --> 01:52:49,409
This copy of "The making of"
will prove it.

1488
01:52:51,744 --> 01:52:53,871
Why do I want it?
I can't see it.

1489
01:52:54,122 --> 01:52:56,874
Someone you trust can see it
and tell you. Excuse me.

1490
01:52:58,876 --> 01:53:01,629
These are the final images of
the documentary on Mateo Blanco,

1491
01:53:02,130 --> 01:53:03,757
also known as Harry Caine.

1492
01:53:49,053 --> 01:53:51,556
How's the "documentary",
as Ernesto calls it?

1493
01:53:54,058 --> 01:53:55,185
Very interesting.

1494
01:53:57,061 --> 01:53:58,230
What are you seeing now?

1495
01:54:00,190 --> 01:54:02,859
The last night
coming back from the restaurant.

1496
01:54:03,318 --> 01:54:06,113
How could he film us?
It was dark.

1497
01:54:08,698 --> 01:54:11,576
His headlights and the lighting
on the mobile sculpture

1498
01:54:12,077 --> 01:54:13,829
were enough to see what happened.

1499
01:54:15,205 --> 01:54:18,083
And he's retouched it digitally.

1500
01:54:19,710 --> 01:54:23,005
Ernesto didn't cause the accident,

1501
01:54:23,464 --> 01:54:25,716
and, as well,
he was the first to help you.

1502
01:54:26,342 --> 01:54:28,135
How could he film and drive at the same time?

1503
01:54:29,345 --> 01:54:30,471
I don't know.

1504
01:54:31,847 --> 01:54:33,599
Anything else I should know?

1505
01:54:35,851 --> 01:54:37,103
What are you watching now?

1506
01:54:38,897 --> 01:54:42,233
When you were waiting at the roundabout
for a car to pass on your left,

1507
01:54:42,859 --> 01:54:44,736
Lena and you kissed.

1508
01:54:45,987 --> 01:54:46,988
We kissed?
I don't remember that.

1509
01:54:48,615 --> 01:54:52,494
It's a normal kiss, the kind couples give
each other out of habit.

1510
01:54:54,371 --> 01:54:55,664
The last kiss.

1511
01:55:00,169 --> 01:55:03,380
Lena didn't die in your arms
like you'd dreamed,

1512
01:55:04,673 --> 01:55:07,301
but the last sensation
she took from this world

1513
01:55:07,759 --> 01:55:09,511
was the taste of your mouth.

1514
01:55:19,021 --> 01:55:19,772
Is it here?

1515
01:55:25,194 --> 01:55:28,280
Play it frame by frame
so that it lasts longer.

1516
01:56:09,198 --> 01:56:11,325
14 years after shooting it,

1517
01:56:11,700 --> 01:56:14,203
I could finally edit
"Girls and Suitcases".

1518
01:56:29,343 --> 01:56:30,094
It's you.

1519
01:56:30,136 --> 01:56:32,889
- Did you get my messages!
- 1,000 from you and none from Ivan!

1520
01:56:33,723 --> 01:56:34,849
What's that suitcase?

1521
01:56:34,891 --> 01:56:36,643
It's Iván's. He's leaving me.

1522
01:56:37,227 --> 01:56:38,228
and the crutches?

1523
01:56:38,270 --> 01:56:41,481
His ex-wife, the lunatic,
pushed me down the stairs.

1524
01:56:41,898 --> 01:56:44,109
I've split up with my husband too.

1525
01:56:44,609 --> 01:56:45,860
I'm sorry.

1526
01:56:46,653 --> 01:56:48,989
I've made coffee,
do you mind pouring it?

1527
01:56:49,489 --> 01:56:51,366
I was looking for Ivan all night.

1528
01:56:51,867 --> 01:56:54,745
Then I had a photo session
and I still haven't slept.

1529
01:56:55,037 --> 01:56:56,163
Neither have K

1530
01:56:56,997 --> 01:56:59,500
- When did you two split up?
- Four days ago.

1531
01:56:59,917 --> 01:57:00,876
Sugar?

1532
01:57:01,877 --> 01:57:03,045
I saw it coming.

1533
01:57:03,504 --> 01:57:07,257
But after we broke up,
I went out on the street

1534
01:57:07,675 --> 01:57:09,760
and saw a guy looking at me.
Gazpacho! I'll have some.

1535
01:57:10,803 --> 01:57:12,388
I put in a whole box
of sleeping pills.

1536
01:57:13,722 --> 01:57:14,515
Why?

1537
01:57:15,516 --> 01:57:18,185
In case Ivan came.
He loves gazpacho.

1538
01:57:18,769 --> 01:57:20,021
Really, Pina!

1539
01:57:20,062 --> 01:57:23,024
That's nothing. Since he didn't call.
I tore out the phone.

1540
01:57:23,065 --> 01:57:26,903
I tripped over it but I didn't ask
because I didn't want to be nosy.

1541
01:57:28,404 --> 01:57:29,446
The bed?

1542
01:57:30,031 --> 01:57:31,533
Is that smoke?

1543
01:57:32,575 --> 01:57:35,662
I dropped a match and it went on fire.
I didn't want to put it out.

1544
01:57:36,203 --> 01:57:37,455
Fire purifies.

1545
01:57:37,914 --> 01:57:39,206
Get your coffee.

1546
01:57:43,545 --> 01:57:45,422
Were you telling me something?

1547
01:57:53,180 --> 01:57:55,473
I was telling you...

1548
01:57:56,809 --> 01:57:58,435
that I've got a suitcase at home too.

1549
01:57:58,936 --> 01:57:59,687
Your husband's?

1550
01:58:01,814 --> 01:58:04,567
A suitcase with 30 pounds
of top quality, uncut cocaine.

1551
01:58:06,234 --> 01:58:07,194
Are you a dealer now?

1552
01:58:07,695 --> 01:58:09,697
No! I'm still a councilor
for Social Affairs.

1553
01:58:10,322 --> 01:58:12,991
The suitcase appeared in my closet,
all of a sudden.

1554
01:58:15,578 --> 01:58:18,206
I have to get rid of those 30 pounds
right away.

1555
01:58:18,831 --> 01:58:21,084
There's a lot of drugs in politics,
because of the hours.

1556
01:58:21,500 --> 01:58:24,837
Between the party and the Council,
I could shift five pounds.

1557
01:58:25,254 --> 01:58:26,380
But the rest?

1558
01:58:26,714 --> 01:58:29,342
- Throw it away.
- Are you crazy?

1559
01:58:29,592 --> 01:58:32,261
I have to make sure the police
don't find it in my house.

1560
01:58:32,846 --> 01:58:35,098
- I don't understand...
- It's obvious!

1561
01:58:35,139 --> 01:58:39,102
If they catch me with all that cocaine
they'll arrest me.

1562
01:58:39,519 --> 01:58:42,981
Yes, but I don't understand how
the suitcase got in your closet.

1563
01:58:47,736 --> 01:58:48,987
As I was saying,

1564
01:58:49,238 --> 01:58:52,741
after I split up with my husband,
I went out on the street

1565
01:58:53,742 --> 01:58:54,784
and there was a guy eyeing at me,
good-looking!

1566
01:58:55,494 --> 01:58:56,536
His ass!

1567
01:58:56,996 --> 01:58:58,247
His feet!

1568
01:58:58,788 --> 01:59:00,749
I brought him home
and screwed him several times.

1569
01:59:01,166 --> 01:59:04,128
I'm very interested in sex
as a social matter.

1570
01:59:06,005 --> 01:59:06,756
How was it?

1571
01:59:07,381 --> 01:59:09,258
In bed? A virtuoso!

1572
01:59:09,759 --> 01:59:11,010
I've never seen anything like it!

1573
01:59:12,637 --> 01:59:14,013
What a big toe!

1574
01:59:15,139 --> 01:59:16,807
Look, my hairs are standing on end.

1575
01:59:17,892 --> 01:59:18,893
Then what happened?

1576
01:59:19,310 --> 01:59:22,897
After we screwed, he asked if he could
stay with me for a few days.

1577
01:59:23,773 --> 01:59:26,442
- Got any muffins?
- Yes, on the shelf.

1578
01:59:27,902 --> 01:59:29,445
And there's a creme caramel.

1579
01:59:29,487 --> 01:59:31,156
I'll have that afterwards.

1580
01:59:32,532 --> 01:59:35,827
So, he asked if he could stay
and I said all right,

1581
01:59:36,161 --> 01:59:39,665
but I wasnt promising anything.
I didn't want him to think I was easy.

1582
01:59:40,081 --> 01:59:43,459
Anyway, he turned up
with a suitcase and moved in.

1583
01:59:45,336 --> 01:59:47,548
Last night, on TV,

1584
01:59:48,424 --> 01:59:52,678
I saw he'd been arrested
in a drug bust.

1585
01:59:53,554 --> 01:59:56,307
He's one of the biggest
drug traffickers in the country.

1586
01:59:57,224 --> 01:59:58,309
What?

1587
01:59:59,851 --> 02:00:01,603
So, kind of suspicious,

1588
02:00:02,729 --> 02:00:04,065
I open the suitcase

1589
02:00:04,731 --> 02:00:07,609
and I find it full
of bags of cocaine.

1590
02:00:11,698 --> 02:00:12,574
I took one,

1591
02:00:13,950 --> 02:00:16,368
went out on the street
and haven't been back since.

1592
02:00:18,705 --> 02:00:19,956
What a story!

1593
02:00:20,457 --> 02:00:22,584
I was surprised he screwed so well.

1594
02:00:24,336 --> 02:00:27,964
For men who live at that level of risk,
it's like evey screw is the last.

1595
02:00:28,465 --> 02:00:29,966
And there is no comparison.

1596
02:00:30,383 --> 02:00:31,843
Look at those goose bumps!

1597
02:00:32,344 --> 02:00:34,596
Yeah, I saw it before,
You've got a talent...

1598
02:00:35,222 --> 02:00:36,223
And the suitcase?

1599
02:00:40,352 --> 02:00:42,729
I was going to ask
if I could bring it here?

1600
02:00:43,855 --> 02:00:44,731
You hear?

1601
02:00:46,024 --> 02:00:47,233
I'll bring it here.

1602
02:00:47,901 --> 02:00:49,235
If they find it in my house,
it's not for what could happen to me,

1603
02:00:49,653 --> 02:00:53,239
although it's not ideal for
a councilor for social affairs,

1604
02:00:53,657 --> 02:00:55,617
but the mayor would be so upset.

1605
02:00:55,659 --> 02:00:59,246
And my party?
It couldn't take another scandal!

1606
02:00:59,746 --> 02:01:00,997
Don't shout.

1607
02:01:01,998 --> 02:01:02,749
The police!

1608
02:01:03,500 --> 02:01:06,128
How could it be?
No one knows you are here.

1609
02:01:06,628 --> 02:01:09,131
I've been
very striking since I was a child.

1610
02:01:09,173 --> 02:01:11,633
Act like you've come for coffee.

1611
02:01:27,817 --> 02:01:29,694
That's what we've got re-edited.

1612
02:01:31,196 --> 02:01:33,281
Do you think it's worth carrying on,

1613
02:01:33,948 --> 02:01:35,283
or is it crazy?

1614
02:01:35,783 --> 02:01:37,910
What?
I pissed myself laughing!

1615
02:01:38,411 --> 02:01:40,038
I'm dying to see what happens.

1616
02:01:44,417 --> 02:01:45,919
It's wonderful, Mateo.

1617
02:01:46,669 --> 02:01:48,421
It's hilarious.
You have to re-release it.

1618
02:01:48,463 --> 02:01:50,674
No, what matters is to finish it.

1619
02:01:51,049 --> 02:01:54,302
Films have to be finished,
even if you do it blindly.

1620
02:01:55,000 --> 02:01:58,109
